HARD CUT TO

EXT - WHITE WATER RAFT —- DAY 1

Lurching headlong over the edge of a fall we are thrust into the
heart of the action pile-driving down the rapids with an
exuberant American at the helm JUNO KAPLAN fiesty sexy and
hard as nails is steering the rubber raft as her friends SARAH
and BETH paddle frantically on each side

CUT TO

EXT - RAPIDS - DAY 2

The team continue their journey downstream at a frantic pace
tossed around on the water like rag dolls barely able to
maintain control against the current treacherous rocky outcrops
hurtling by on either side boulders beneath the surface lying
in wait to snag flesh or break bones

JUNO is loving every dangerous second of it SARAH and BETH are
less certain Eventually they make it through into calmer
water But it is the calm before the storm

Ahead of them lies one final challenge

CUT TO

EXT - WHITE WATER RAFT - DAY 3

SARAH
What is that

JUNO
The meat-grinder

BETH
Who names these things

The full horror of these falls becomes more apparent the closer
they get to edge

SARAH
I don’t know if I’m ready for this
yet
They back-paddle to slow themselves downunsure

SARAH looks ahead and sees at the bottom of the rapids standing
on the river bank are her husband PAUL (35ish) and her daughter
JESSICA JUNO clocks this as well
JUNO

Come on Sarahthey’re watching you
Let’s make ‘em proud

JESSICA

CUT TO
EXT - WHITE WATER RAFT - DAY 4A

SARAH takes a deep breath

SARAH
Alright
BETH
Alright
JUNO
ALRIGHT Come on Paddle

They paddle in earnest toward the brink There’s no going back
now

With a stomach-churning drop they go over into the fray Almost
immediately they lose control spinning through the narrow
confines of the rocks

JUNO (CONTD)
Keep paddling

SARAH and BETH struggle against the current as they are thrown
back and forth bouncing off the rocks
Finally emerging from the ‘Meat-Grinder’ they drift toward
shore where PAUL and JESSICA come to meet them

JESSICA
Mummy Mummy

JUNO glowing with the thrill of it all pats SARAH on the
shoulder

JUNO
That wasn’t so bad was it

SARAH and BETH are in fit of hysterical laughter Glad to be
alive JUNO stands up in the boat clowning around for JESSICA’s
sake

BETH
Shall we

SARAH
Yeah

They both push JUNO over and she falls backwards into the water
PAUL grabs her hands and pulls her to shore as JESSICA greets
her Mum with a big hug

BETH dragging the raft to shore clocks the look JUNO gives
PAUL as he pulls her TOO CLOSE It’s just a moment It could be
nothing but it could be something Then it’s over

They are all laughing as it begins to rain Thunder booms
overhead

PAUL
Jess come on you’re going to get
wet
PAUL and JESSICA head back to the car JUNO turns to SARAH

JUNO
You go on ahead

SARAH
You sure

BETH
We can finish up here You go

SARAH
Thanks guys We’1ll see you back at the
hotel

SARAH turns and hurries off after PAUL and JESSICA

INT - CAR - DAY 5

PAUL driving is distant his mind elsewhere He recoils when
SARAH touches his hand Nothing deliberate or nasty but his
mind is on something else someone else

CUT TO

EXT - CAR —- DAY 5A

Moving across the front windscreen as the wipers clunk and whine
back and forth we PULL FOCUS to JESSICA playing in the back
then PULL FOCUS again to see Paul turn from glancing at her to
the road ahead

INT - CAR - FACE FORWARD - DAY 5B

We look out of the front windscreen with SARAH on the left PAUL
on the right Traffic speeds past in the opposite direction
throwing more water against the windscreen Another CAR is
travelling ahead of them They are moving at speed

Suddenly the CAR in front of them veers left into the curb It
bounces back across the road and into the oncoming lane slamming
into the back end of a passing VAN The impact is enough to
knock the speeding VAN off course sending it hurtling directly
toward US

SARAH screams out PAUL tries to steer clear but the VAN
collides HEAD ON at high speed

The VAN is loaded with scaffolding and the force of the impact
causes one of the scaffold supports to hurtle forward like a
missile through the cab of the VAN through both windscreens
and into PAUL’s face impaling his head

As she begins to pull them out the heart monitor flat-lines and
gives off a steady constant tone

She gets out of bed and we

CUT TO

INT - HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - NIGHT 6D

The entire building is apparently deserted as SARAH emerges from
her room She pauses looking each way the pure white of the
fluorescent lights almost glaringly harsh

Suddenly beyond her the furthest FLUORESCENT light flickers
and dies leaving a gaping black hole at the far end of the
corridor SARAH turns to it entranced by the shadows We can
hear something within the darkness a scratching sound then
breathing
SARAH backs away Another light goes out the next one along
extending the darkness toward her following her as she
retreats walking at first but when a third light goes out she
quickens her pace

Again we hear the sounds coming from within the darkness mixed
with her own gasping as she breaks into a run the light
switching off in succession behind her the darkness pursuing
her along the corridor and catching up No matter how fast she
runs she cannot get away from it until at last she glances
behind her and the light above her goes out

Now she is in the darkness running after the light She glances
back There is a harsh rasping shriek coming at her from the
shadows and she turns back she runs headlong into BETH
SUDDENLY everything returns to normality They are in a busy
hospital corridor All the lights are on People come and go
and SARAH is still just outside her hospital room

BETH
Sarah

But SARAH is a quivering wreck unable to fathom reality
clinging to BETH for support

BETH (cont’d)

We look over BETH’s shoulder at SARAH’s eyes blank staring as

BETH drives Next to her SARAH her hair cut shorter stares
blankly out at the passing road BETH is fiddling with the radio
from which some swampy twangy music emanates

BETH
Its mud blood and beer

She twists the dial again and we hear the bellows of a preacher

BETH (contd)
Or God

BETH switches off the radio SARAH stares out at the gloomy
dusk oblivious

Suddenly an overhanging branch bangs against the windscreen
startling SARAH BETH looks at her and stops the car at the side
of the road There is that total rural silence that accounts
for the in-breeding and the high suicide rate

BETH
We don’t have to do this you know We
can turn back stay in town get
wasted and go to a barn dance

SARAH
Now that is frightening

A motorcycle zooms up out of nowhere two shaven-headed local
guys on it As their headlights pick out the girls in the
stationary car they scream and holler the back passenger
raising a clenched fist in salute The noise and the bikers are
swallowed up by the gathering darkness

BETH
My kind of town

SARAH straightens up pulling herself together

SARAH
You’re right We don’t have to do
this But I’m not going to be the one
to tell Juno

BETH smiles relieved She starts up the car and they continue
on their way

BETH
Shes a piece of work - she always
drags us out to the middle of

BETH(contd)
She probably bribed someone to get

make sure we stay on her turf

JUNO holds Sarah’s face in her hands She’s warm intense
compelling

JUNO
Everything’s going to be fine Better

She takes SARAH’s bag and pushes her towards the light and
laughter Once Sarah is out of earshot JUNO looks at BETH

JUNO (contd)

BETH
Shes here I wouldn’t push it any
further than that

Picking up her bag she walks past Juno

BETH (contd)

BETH

And they head towards the door past a large window through
which we can see women gathered around a roaring log fire
drinking talking and laughing

Rebecca Van Ney (tall athletic Scandinavian mid 20s) has her
arm around SARAH

REBECCA
It’s so good to see you So good

A smaller version of Rebecca runs into the room

SAM
Beth Sarah

SARAH gets up to embrace her It is clear from the expression on
her face that all the lights the people are slightly too much
for her

SARAH
(quietly)
Sam Thank you for your letter it
meant a lot to me

SAM
I’m sorry I couldn’t be there Mid-

JUNO

BETH

But Sarah is staring into the fire distracted JUNO shrugs and
walks off SAM laughs at BETH

SAM

like I hear it all starts falling
apart past twenty-five

BETH swipes at her playfully

BETH

And in walks HOLLY about 18 in skate clothes with rings
everywhere and spiky hair smoking some home-grown She is
incredibly attractive

HOLLY

HOLLY (CONT)

JUNO

first ever trip

She hands SARAH an old slightly battered photo It shows three
teenage girls - JUNO SARAH and BETH - with their arms around
each other elated against a blue sky

SARAH

EXT LODGE NIGHT 14

The lodge its windows lit up looks invitingly warm against the

women enjoying themselves inside the sound of their laughter
and conversation fading on the breeze We HOLD on this for a
moment and then very slowly begin to TRACK IN on the window

Holly looks at her

HOLLY

you Juno

REBECCA

It’s a women-only outward-bound
centre We’re going to do trips all
over the country - climbing caving
skydiving surfing

She stretches her impossibly long legs

REBECCA (contd)
There’s a real market for women who
don’t want the bullshit that comes
with a mixed group

HOLLY
What bullshit

JUNO
(teasing of Rebecca)
Well there’s the gear freaks Those
guys who have to have the latest
gadget and use it all the time No
room for instinct

Rebecca laughs realizing that Juno’s comment is directed at
her She continues the joke

REBECCA
(of Holly)
And the peak-baggers - they don’t care
where they are it’s just about
whether they’ve got to the top of
enough of them

SARAH
(of Juno)
And the guys who’ve got to be the
leader who’ve got to hold the map and
want to turn the whole thing into the
army I’ve had them

BETH
(to Sam)
And the guys who make you the baby of
the group even if you’ve done more
than them

nest

SARAH looks upwards to see the BATS swirling around the funnel
of the cave entrance in an elegant spiral After the shock it’s
an eerie yet beautiful sight

HOLLY
The butterflies of the night

BETH
Oh fuck off Holly

From a high vantage point we watch the group make their way
downwards into the cave

SAM
Which way
JUNO
Only one way out of this chamber Down

Water dripping from the rocks all around the ENTRANCE CAVERN
gathers at its lowest point and flows into a crack in the cavern
floor This is where our intrepid CAVERS must go

They are in a narrow vertical shaft with plenty of footholds
all the way down The water drips heavily down the side of the
shaft as the women head deeper into the mountain

INT DESCENDING TUNNEL DARK 67
Further down the tunnel levels off to a shallow downward slope
With each step the tunnel randomly fluctuates in size and shape
sometimes it’s tall and very thin sometimes it’s wide and low
so that they must stoop or even crawl to pass through and all
the way water drips from the roof above their heads

SARAH
How are you feeling

SAM
Exhausted But don’t tell Rebecca

We see various shots of the group making their way deeper and
deeper into the cave system until at last they emerge into a
vast chamber and we

DISSOLVE TO

INT CATHEDRAL CAVERN DARK 69

JUNO
-For THIS we need a little more
light on the subject

JUNO takes out one of the many PHOSPHOROUS FLARES they have and
lights it up Now the chamber is filled with a hot white light
throwing hard shadows of countless stalactites across the walls

The roof and floor of this new cavern are littered with gigantic
stalagmites and stalactites pillars of rock formed over
millions of years sediment building upward and downward until
some of them bridge the entire cap The colour of the new rock
is yellow with sulphur and red with iron The entire chamber is
an amazing spectacle

The group spread out as they enter this grand subterranean
cathedral almost gothic in its design each of them eager to
explore their own corner of the cave

From a HIGH LEDGE we look down on the group spread around the
chamber Six individual pools of light moving here and there
In the centre the FLARE burns steadily

In the right foreground we become aware that what we thought
was a rock is in fact something else SOMETHING ALIVE moving
slightly Breathing Watching

DISSOLVE TO
SOME TIME LATER

Five members of the group are having a bite to eat and something
to drink as HOLLY snaps away with her camera beyond them

JUNO (contd)
Holly take a break you should eat

HOLLY
I’m just getting a couple more shots
This cave is cooler than I thought

JUNO
(to Sarah)
--You okay
SARAH
Juno I won’t break
JUNO
(quietly)
I know I wanted to say - there’s

nothing I can say But I’m sorry I
didn’t stay around longer After the
accident

She sighs its the first time we’ve seen her anything other than
in control

JUNO (contd)
I’m bad with that stuff And
PaulYou know

SARAH (SOFT)
And Jessie

SARAH and JUNO share a look

JUNO
We’re all here for you now

SARAH
---I’m sorry I’m a bit out of
itIt’s probably jet-lag or
something

SARAH gets up

SARAH
Im going to have a look around

JUNO
See if you can find the way through

BETH
(calling out)
Don’t go too far

SARAH picks up her torch and moves past HOLLY who has been
observing her and JUNO’s exchange

HOLLY
--She flips out

JUNO
She’s fine

BETH
After the crash she broke down pretty
badly Spent months in hospital She
was a mess Couldn’t find a reason to
get up in the mornings

JUNO
Well I guess she found one if she’s
here

CUT TO

Elsewhere in the cavern SARAH skirts the bright light source of
the flare moving among the harsh shadows of stalactite and
stalagmites it creates The sound of water dripping echoes

around her

in her surroundings fascinated by the cave

SARAH hears a noise

the voices of the others are a murmur

She is lost

she spins and aims her TORCH A rock falls

from a ledge and bounces down scree slope clattering to the

ground

SARAH moves forward investigating curious There is an opening
in the cave wall SARAH listens intent - the sound of laughter

SARAH appears suddenly at JUNO’s shoulder

SARAH

At the far end of the chamber the walls converge to meet at the
base of a small heap of scree At the top of the scree is a

narrow fissure It is into this that the women must now go They
gather before the scree

REBECCA
I don’t understand - it’s not how
imagined it from reading the book

JUNO
Caves change tunnels collapse some
of this debris looks recent

REBECCA
Well then should we be going through

JUNO
I’m telling you it’s a tight squeeze
for about a hundred feet and then

REBECCA
Then what

JUNO
Then it opens out into a wider
passage

REBECCA
If you say so It’s your party

SARAH
Something wrong
REBECCA
It’s nothing Where’s Sam
SARAH
I don’t know she was here a minute
ago SAM

And again that giggle high pitched child like She looks
around but its clear the others haven’t heard

The others spread out and look for her calling for Sam The
echoes bounce back After a tense moment a voice comes from
behind a rock

SAM
I’M BUSY

The group all laugh at SAM’S predicament

REBECCA
I made her drink loads of water this
morning

SARAH

I’1ll wait for her
HOLLY worms her way ahead in front of JUNO

HOLLY
I will take point yes

HOLLY discards a half-eaten CANDY BAR and heads into the fissure
hooked onto a rope which JUNO feeds in after her

CUT TO

INT FISSURE DARK 71

HOLLY edges further and further into the fissure As the rocks
funnel inward she must first stoop then crawl then lie flat
and wriggle into this tiny passageway through the rock

HOLLY

BETH looks apprehensive as she shines her torch along the narrow
crawl-way

HOLLY crawls head first through this intensely claustrophobic
passage barely big enough for her to move contorting herself
through the most awkward spaces imaginable Slowly but surely
she edges through until at last the CRAWL SPACE opens out and
she emerges in another tunnel this time with high sloping walls
and a sloping floor running diagonally along its length

HOLLY quickly turns about and part-crawls back into the HOLE

HOLLY
OK I’m through

HOLLY

dust falling from the rock above

BETH is next through It’s very tight but she makes it Again
dust falls from the rocks above her head

BETH
Sarah you still behind me

SARAH
(breathing hard)
I think so

SARAH seems to be having more difficulty than the others as she
is the most uncomfortable in such a claustrophobic environment
Still she shuffles along as best she can until she reaches a
point at which to get through her head must twist to one side
and half submerge in a pool of muddy water It is here that she
wedges herself stuck and can no longer move forward The more
she fights the more dust falls down from the roof inches above
her head hitting her face

SARAH (contd)
Shit Shit

At first she’s just agitated and annoyed but soon she begins to
panic She begins to breathe heavily and fast the muddy water
getting in her mouth

SARAH
I can’t fucking relax

BETH

calm down The only way you can do
that is to breathe slowly

SARAH
(panicking hyperventilating)
I’ve got a million tons of rock above
my head How the fuck am I supposed to
calm down I can’t fucking BREATHE

The more she struggles the more dust rains down on her BETH
in a wider part of the fissure manages to turn herself around
and crawls back toward SARAH

BETH now face to face with SARAH continues to try and calm
SARAH down as her panic attack grows more desperate She
splutters and gags with the mud in her mouth and writhes against
the rock wedging herself even further

BETH can see the dust falling from the rock above and knows the
danger SARAH is in She focuses completely on her soothing
magnetic

BETH
Sarah listen to me What are you
afraid of

SARAH
(agitated)
I can’t move

BETH
You can You can move It’s in your
head

SARAH (WHISPERS)
I know I know but I can’t stop it

BETH
Sarah the worst thing that can happen
to you has already happened

SARAH despite herself is distracted

BETH
It’s over And you’re here You didn’t
give up This is just a poxy little
cave You’ve got NOTHING left to be
afraid of

SARAH begins to calm down

BETH
Sarah

SARAH
Yeah

BETH

I want you to crawl toward me Slowly

SARAH complies edging toward BETH until she feels herself
becoming unstuck

BETH (contd)
Take it slow Okayokay

SARAH
I’m almost out

SARAH uses her feet against the wall to push herself the last
foot or so but with one final push her boot kicks away some
rock and the ceiling of the cave suddenly drops about 2 inches
toward both their headsbut stops

SARAH and BETH freeze in horror There is a moment’s hesitation
then BETH acts

BETH
Fuck Alright MOVE NOW

She grabs SARAH’s collar and heaves her free then the two of
them frantically race along the narrow fissure the roof
cracking threatening to collapse on them at any moment

SARAH glances behind her into the darkness which seems to be
chasing her along the fissure From the darkness comes a
terrifying SHRIEK and then it gives collapsing on the spot
where SARAH was trapped

But the cave-in continues following them along the fissure
gaining on them

SARAH gets to her feet as all eyes and torch beams fall on the
spot HOLLY is looking at The fissure is completely blocked

SAM
Jesus

They fall silent taking in the implications

HOLLY
So what do we do now

REBECCA
Wellaccording to the guide book
this cave system has three ways in and
out This is just one of them Isn’t
that right Juno

JUNO has turned away from the them
REBECCA (contd)
(pressing her for an answer)
Juno that’s right isn’t it Check

JUNO turns around awkwardness and defiance etched on her face

JUNO
I didn’t bring it
REBECCA
What
JUNO
No point
SAM

What do you mean What does she mean

REBECCA knows exactly what she means SARAH has distanced
herself from the group she stares out into the darkness alone

REBECCA
For Chrissakes Juno I knew itI knew
this wasn’t right

JUNO
Oh come on Rebecca this is what we’ve
believed in for ten years If there’s
no risk what’s the point We may as
well stay at home and watch fucking
TV

REBECCA
Don’t you try and justify this I KNOW
why you did this

And she waves her torch irritably catching HOLLY in its beam
obliviously exploring their surroundings

Behind her the argument rages as SARAH sweeps her TORCH BEAM
across the cavern She catches something bright in the beam
just for a fleeting moment something HUMANOID looking back at
her By the time she registers this and sweeps the TORCH BEAM
back to the spot it’s gone

She looks around to see if anyone else saw it but they are far
too self-absorbed

SAM
What are we going to do

HOLLY
Well we have food and water We have
a fuck-off cave to explore

BETH
(to Rebecca)
You filed a flight plan with mountain
rescue If we don’t report in they’ll
come looking for us

cranny BETH follows her furious

BETH

What the hell are you doing What do
you think this is going to do to
Sarah How much more do you think she
can take - not that you’d know what
she’s been through because you
couldn’t get away fast enough

JUNO

You know what Beth We all lost
something in that crash

BETH
Oh bullshit What did you lose

JUNO starts to speak but bites her words back BETH is on her
and shines the torch right in her face

BETH (contd)
What did you lose Juno

JUNOS face says it all A beat

JUNO
Do I have to spell it out

BETH absorbs this She looks at JUNO in disgust keeping the
torch right on her

BETH (contd)
Just get us out of here

JUNO turns and walks back to the others in an effort to regain
control

JUNO
We have to go on Cave systems often
break ground It’s a small
chanceIf we stay here we’ll die

Slowly the women pick up their PACKS and other gear preparing
to move off SARAH stands apart from the others staring into
the darkness hoping for another glimpse to put her mind at
ease The darkness is taking hold

INT GALLERY CAVERN DARK 87

JUNO leads the way down a steep slope of jagged rocks and loose
boulders Around them grows a low rumble and the steady drip
and splash of falling water

JUNO scans the area checking on the others while SAM eager to
press on overtakes her and moves toward US

JUNO
(Shouts )
Stop

SAM stops dead and everyone else does too

SAM
What

JUNO
DON’T MOVE Just stay there

JUNO takes off her pack and removes a FLARE quickly striking
it up

What it reveals is that the floor drops away beneath SAM’s feet

A RAVINE about 20 feet across and so deep they can’t see the
bottom but can hear the rumbling from far below

SAM
What is that

REBECCA
Underground river

SAM picks up a rock and drops it over the edge a long long
pause then a distant clattering and a splash

REBECCA (contd)
-- now I know how far down it is

SAM
So

REBECCA
Well somebody has to cross first and
that’s my job

JUNO strikes up a FLARE and throws it across the chasm where
strikes the wall and lands on a ledge highlighting another
ledge and cleft in the rockface A possible way through

REBECCA stares at the ravine and the ceiling above them

JUNO
How does it look

REBECCA
What does it matter There’s no
alternative

JUNO
There’s a crack running right across
the roof

REBECCA
I see it

SAM

How does that help

REBECCA
I have to get all the way across so I
can rig a line for you guys So I go
hand over hand put my hand in the
crack clench my fist and hang on

BETH
You’ve done this before right

it

REBECCA
I saw a guy do it once An instructor
On an artificial wall over a block of
crash-mats

SAM is apprehensive on her sister’s behalf The OTHERS look at
REBECCA with a mixture of hope and admiration All except JUNO
who is already rigging a safety-rope for REBECCA

REBECCA attaches the rope to her harness and pulls on heavy
leather GLOVES - flexing her fists

At this end the crack is low enough to reach She tries it
Puts her fist in Clenches Swings her feet off the floor and
hangs by one arm

REBECCA begins her perilous free-style crossing of the canyon
roof hand over hand wedging her fist into the fissure and
hanging by it She’s hooked onto a safety line which she
attaches to PITONS along the way

She is now hanging directly above the chasm It is an incredible
feat of stamina muscle power and raw physical grit Swinging
from hand to hand finding the best purchase swapping her
weight from one hand to the other then doing it all again Two
foot at a time at most Every so often stopping taking a
PITON from her belt placing it in the narrow crack attaching a
CARABINA and hooking on her safety line all whilst hanging by
one hand

Slowly terrifyingly edging her way toward the far side
CUT TO
HOLLY films her all the way as best she can in the given light
CUT TO

Passing the halfway point REBECCA stops dead Something just
ahead has her absolute attention

It is a PITON an old one hammered into the fissure invisible
to the others but clear enough to her as evidence that someone
at some time has passed this way before But she pauses too
long and JUNO senses something is up

JUNO
What’s wrong

REBECCA
Nothing

Their voices echo around the cavern REBECCA glances back toward
JUNO and their eyes meet It’s a knowing glance but JUNO isn’t
fully aware of what she’s supposed to know

REBECCA (contd)
I’m alright

REBECCA turns back to the job at hand In order to disguise the
PITON rather than raise unnecessary questions or concerns in
the minds of the rest of the team she hooks a CARABINA to it
just as she’s done to the others she’s placed

Two more swings and she’s reached the far side She drops down
onto the ledge above the one with the FLARE on it Beyond the
ledge is a tall but narrow crack in the rock just big enough
for them to squeeze through

REBECCA quickly hammers in a final PITON and secures a SAFETY
LINE before hooking herself on

REBECCA (contd)
Throw me the line

JUNO steps up to the edge of the drop and hurls a coiled rope
across to REBECCA Unfurling as it goes REBECCA leans out over
the bottomless drop to catch the flailing end of the rope in one
hand She succeeds and very calmly ties it on to a secure
PITON pulling the rope taut across the canyon

REBECCA (contd)
Alright who’s first

SAM steps forward

SAM
I’1l go

SAM attaches the CARABINA of her SAFETY HARNESS to the TRAVERSE
LINE and an extra CARABINA to the SAFETY LINE strung across the
roof of the CAVERN Now using the SAFETY LINE to pull herself
across while the TRAVERSE LINE holds her weight SAM makes her
way across the roof of the CANYON CAVERN

REBECCA cries out in agony and BETH grabs hold of the rope
JUNO’s harness now pulls taut suspended from the SAFETY LINE
REBECCA wails in agony as JUNO hangs there momentarily looking
up at the SAFETY LINE

Now the OLD PITON gives way pulling free from the rock and
dropping JUNO another ten feet toward her doom But now the rope
and pitons hold fast SAM and BETH are holding the line

splits into THREE JUNO stops dead the momentum lost

JUNO
Shit SHIT

The others gather round

JUNO (contd)
Who’s got a lighter I need to check

HOLLY fumbles through her pocket finds her lighter and gives
it to JUNO who takes each tunnel in turn standing at its
entrance holding the lighter and seeing if there is a breeze
sucking air through

The first does nothing The second does nothing But at the
third the lighter flickers

HOLLY
That’s the one

At that she takes off down the tunnel

JUNO
Holly wait Damn it

They set off after HOLLY but she’s away and hurrying ahead of
them faster and faster until something catches her eye She
stops turning off the light in her helmet and her torch

Up ahead in the pitch darkness she can just make out a faint
blue glow DAYLIGHT

HOLLY
Daylight I see daylight

Before others can catch up she is off and running again this
time without any lights on Using the DAYLIGHT to guide her

But when she rounds the bend and sees it isn’t daylight at all
but LUMINESCENT ALGAE growing on the wall the floor drops away
beneath her It’s a SINKHOLE and she slides uncontrollably down
the slippery rock toward the brink

JUNO quickly arrives at the scene with the FLARE and dives
toward where HOLLY was last standing She lunges toward the edge
of the SINKHOLE where the slippery rock forms an angled funnel
in the floor of the cave She jams her shoulder against a sharp
rock and winces

HOLLY (cont‘d)
Help me

JUNO just manages to grab her hand but HOLLY’s fingers are
covered in slime making it impossible to hold on JUNO is
pressed against the rock which is cutting her arm HOLLY is
going First her hand slips

JUNO
Don’t move

-then her fingers pull from JUNO’s grasp as HOLLY slides
slowly relentlessly down into the funnel There are countless
other scratch marks around her She’s not the first to slide
down here She can only look back at JUNO helpless out of
reach as gravity works against her pulling her down into the
unknown darkness below She can’t help but move

SARAH and the others reach the edge in time to look down as the
terrified HOLLY slides over the brink and disappears into the

and feels something protruding

Raising her head she looks down shining her HEAD LAMP on the
spot to see her shin bone has broken and burst through the
skin The wound isn’t bleeding but muscle and sinews are hanging
out of her leg
She falls back gasping for breath against the pain

HOLLY (cont‘d)
Please get down here

CUT TO

INT - SLOPING CAVERN - DARK 101

JUNO is already on the case bleeding shoulder and all
hammering in PITONS along with REBECCA as they prepare to tie on
and climb down into the SINKHOLE

JUNO and SAM rapidly abseil down through the SINKHOLE REBECCA
BETH and SARAH are quick to follow

CUT TO

102 INT - DRAINAGE TUNNEL LEDGE - DARK 102
SAM

This place is not good We have to
move you and it’s going to hurt like a
son of a bitch

HOLLY
(through gritted teeth)
Alright but make it quickmake it
quick quick quick

HOLLY is delirious with pain as SAM continues her work and SARAH
and BETH arrive at the scene

SARAH
How is she

SAM
Shes going to be fine

SAM takes a sharp CLASP KNIFE from a sheath on her belt and uses
it to cut open HOLLY’s trouser leg revealing the true extent of
the wound

BETH
(seeing the wound)
Ah God That is fucking disgusting

SAM
Beth Not here Not now We need help Grab
a corner We need to move her out of the
water

They all do as she bids SAM cradling the broken leg as gently
as she can

SAM
Nice and easy now lift

HOLLY groans as she’s slowly lifted out of the water and moved
onto a rocky ledge When she is put down the pain is unbearable

HOLLY
Ahh Jeeessussss

SAM
Juno pass me the first aid kit And
see if you find something to make a
splint out of

BETH takes some spare clothing from her PACK and places it under
HOLLY’s head as REBECCA and the others set to work binding and
strapping the broken limb with the limited FIRST AID KIT they
have available

JUNO pulls the PICK from HOLLY’S RUCKSACK and unscrews the top
She intends to use the handle as a splint

REBECCA activates a couple of SNAP LIGHTS filling the area with
soft BLUE LIGHT SARAH has also distanced herself from the
others and is watching JUNO Just then she hears a noise very
faint like a small rock falling from somewhere upstream along
this DRAINAGE TUNNEL REBECCA BETH and SAM are too busy seeing
to HOLLY’s leg to take any notice

But JUNO and SARAH notice and SARAH sets off down the tunnel
cautiously to investigate

JUNO
Sarah don’t wander off
(SARAH takes no notice)
-Sarah

SAM
Juno I’m going to need your help
here

JUNO is distracted by SARAH

SAM (cont’d)
Juno

JUNO joins the group around HOLLY

SAM (cont’d)
Take hold of her arm you’re going to
need to hold her down

HOLLY
What are you going to do

SAM
I need to dress the wound and rig up a
splint but I can’t do that while the
bone is protruding I have to push it
back in

HOLLY looks at her Knows it has to be done

SAM (cont’d)
Here bite down on this

SAM puts a leather strap between HOLLY’s teeth as REBECCA holds
her legs and BETH and JUNO hold her arms to stop her flailing
around and making it worse

HOLLY is already sweating as she bites down on the strap

SAM uses her fingers to open up the muscles and her thumb to
force the bone back into the leg BETH cannot bear to look as
HOLLY biting down hard screams in agony as we

CUT TO

INT - DRAINAGE TUNNEL - DARK 103

SARAH hears the scream but continues regardless exploring
deeper and deeper into this new network of tunnels

Looking around something lying up ahead in the stream catches
her eye The beam of her HEAD LAMP reflects off an old MINER’S
HELMET wedged in a cleft

Picking it up she studies it It is badly damaged but a name is
clearly painted in black on the front of it ED OSWALD

Then she hears something else up ahead something that sounds
like the shriek of a bird Or a child She looks up

CUT TO

INT - DRAINAGE TUNNEL LEDGE - DARK 104
With one last effort SAM finally pushes the bone back into place
and through the searing pain HOLLY spits out the STRAP and gasps
in air

JUNO looks up toward the direction SARAH went in and we

CUT TO

INT - DRAINAGE TUNNEL - DARK 105

Searching the way with the beams of her TORCH and HEAD LAMP
SARAH notices something very vague catching the light in the
distance Whatever it is it only stands out because it is a
lighter colour than the rock around it

The closer she gets the more form it takes but still it remains
vague and unidentifiable Is she seeing things She begins to
doubt it herself

She moves on the shape appears to be moving Step by step she
grows ever closer until the shape begins to take definite form
in the farthest reach of her torch light

It looks human It makes a sudden move then freezes listening
SARAH starts freezing herself straining her eyes to see

It is a figure facing away from her squatting low and hunched
over drinking from the water its shoulders and head moving
slightly It is still very difficult to make out but it looks
incredibly gaunt and sinewy pale yellowey white and totally
naked

SUDDENLY a hand grasps SARAH shoulder She starts and spins
around almost blinding JUNO with her lights

JUNO
Sarah What are you doing

SARAH
(anxious whisper)
There’s something I saw a manup
ahead in the tunnel

She turns back and aims the torch along the tunnel but it is
now empty

JUNO
There’s nothing there

SARAH pointedly hands JUNO the helmet She looks at it as SARAH
heads back to join the others JUNO watches her concerned

CUT TO

INT - DRAINAGE TUNNEL LEDGE 106

SAM has finished dressing HOLLY’s wound and uses the PICK HANDLE
as a SPLINT

SAM
There That’s the best I can do It’ll
hurt like hell and you won’t be able
to put any weight on it but you can
move

REBECCA looks at her little sister with admiration HOLLY winces
as she tries moving her leg

JUNO and SARAH return in the middle of an animated discussion

JUNO
ee eee It’s just old mining gear Sarah
They combed these mountains for gold
over a century ago Anyone trapped
down here would be a skeleton by now

SARAH (QUIET)
-that’s just what it looked like

BETH
What WHAT looked like

JUNO
Sarah thinks she saw somebody back
there

BETH
She what

SARAH
I don’t THINK I saw someone I saw
someone

JUNO
You heard something You saw what you
wanted to see It’s the dark it plays
tricks

BETH is thinking along the same lines now watching SARAH with
concerned eyes

SARAH
There are things I want to see That
wasn’t one of them

SAM
What did you see

SARAH
A man I saw a man

REBECCA
Are you sure

SARAH
Yes and it’s not the first time I
thought I saw someone before But now
I’m sure

She looks around at five doubting faces

SARAH (cont‘d)
-really I’m sure

JUNO catches BETH’sS eye

JUNO
Sarah there’s no-one down here Forget
it We have to get Holly out

All the women in the group know she’s right even BETH who gives
SARAH an encouraging little nod of the head

CUT TO
INT - DRAINAGE TUNNEL - DARK 107
JUNO strikes up the lighter and it flickers This is the way

HOLLY is hopping along in great pain between BETH and SAM
while SARAH JUNO and REBECCA lead the way upstream

CUT TO

FURTHER UPSTREAM - They reach the bottom of a short waterfall
down which the stream bubbles from a larger chamber above

JUNO is the first to go followed by the others She slowly
peers over the brink to look upon the scene laid out before her
in wide eyed horror

CUT TO

INT - BONE DAM - DARK 108

Water is constantly dripping from various parts of the ceiling
forming the stream But the chamber itself is flooded about a

foot deep because the top of the waterfall is blocked by a DAM
made out of BONES

Each of the team make it to the top to look upon this scene of
carnage with fear and amazement Each of them scans the carpet
of bones with their torch beams picking out skulls and antlers

SARAH spots a piece of clothing shredded perhaps belonging to
the missing cavers But there are no human remains here

BETH
What is this place

SAM
Looks like a slaughter house

SARAH approaches HOLLY

SARAH
Holly let me use your cam-corder I
want to see what I can see on infra-
red

HOLLY hands it over and SARAH scans the entire area with it

SARAH (cont‘d)
Dead animals Hundreds of them

JUNO turns her torch to the rest of the cavern It appears to be
the centre of a honeycomb of tunnels leading off in every
direction Some carrying water to feed the stream others dry

BETH
This is definitely not good

SAM
(nervous )
Can we get out of here

REBECCA
Which way

JUNO is trying out the LIGHTER again but the flame is
flickering from all directions

JUNO
(a little panicked)
I don’t know

CUT TO

109 INT - INFRA-RED POV - DARK 109

SARAH flits the INFRA-RED CAMERA from face to face in the
darkness

BETH
What do you mean you don’t know

JUNO
The breeze is coming from all over the
place It could be any one of these
tunnels Take your pick

SAM
(under her breath) )
Fuck

REBECCA
Hello Is there anybody there

JUNO
(contemptuous )
Oh please

BETH
Right now I’m willing to try
anything HELLO

When we return to BETH we see another figure standing at her
shoulder It’s vaguely human very pale in the green of the
INFRA-RED It is totally hairless and gaunt Its eyes appear to
be sealed closed and it has large mutated ears and a jaw line
distended to accommodate a mouthful of jagged teeth In the
darkness it appears ready to strike at BETH’s back but when
JUNO’s torch lights it up it rapidly retreats into the shadows

This thing is a STYGIAN CRAWLER and this is its lair

CUT TO

INT - BONE DAM - DARK 110

Now they’ve all seen it and react in horror and shock

Torch lights flash around the chamber trying to pin-point this
strange apparition but it’s too fast darting left and right
up and across the walls of the chamber evading their attempts
to get a good look of it It’s just a pale agile figure
darting this way and that and letting rip a hideous piercing
shriek as it goes JUNO struggles to light a flare and once it
strikes she holds it up to illuminate the whole CAVERN but just
as quickly as it appeared the CRAWLER is gone

HOLLY
Jesus

BETH
What was that WHAT THE FUCK WAS
THAT

REBECCA

I don’t know I could barely see it
moved so fast

SARAH
I told you we weren’t alone

SAM
SARAH THAT WAS NOT A HUMAN FUCKING
BEING

JUNO
Fuck this Let’s pick a tunnel and
take our chances

BETH aids HOLLY as they head into the tunnel but their progress
comes to a rapid halt as a terrible and unearthly sound fills
the tunnel ahead It is a rasping shrieking noise and it’s
coming their way

SAM
What’s happening

REBECCA
-There’s more of them

They quickly back off and choose another tunnel

CUT TO

INT - HONEYCOMB 1 - DARK 111

BETH and HOLLY are up front with JUNO bringing up the rear
constantly looking back toward the ever advancing sound

HOLLY and BETH look behind as the shrieks grow noticeably
louder meaning whatever is making the noise has reached the
BONE DAM

SARAH
Juno

JUNO
What

SARAH

The flare They can hear us

JUNO clocks the loud hissing of the FLARE and thinks she may
have a point The group pause as JUNO hurls the FLARE back along
the tunnel toward the BONE DAM

BETH and HOLLY turn to face front once more only to run straight
into one of the CRAWLERS its eyes wide its jaw stretched wide
open revealing it’s lethal fangs

It is humanoid but far from human and it shrieks wildly as it
launches itself at HOLLY the weakest of the team

REBECCA
RUN

The nature and ferocity of the attack cause the woman to scatter
in fear and run like Hell They have no plan other than to get
away from this spot as fast as possible In the chaos REBECCA
and SAM flee in the opposite direction to SARAH and BETH and
they all soon become lost in the network of passageways

Behind them the hideous shrieking mingles with HOLLY desperate
garbled cries to form an appalling crescendo

And JUNO rises to the occasion angry now pulls out her PICK in
an effort to defend HOLLY from the CRAWLER The creature tears
at HOLLY’s clothing and sinks its teeth into her neck shaking
her writhing thrashing form like a rag doll

JUNO (contd)
Leave her alone you fucker

She lashes out at the CRAWLER cutting a gash down the side of
its face The CRAWLER hisses at her angrily as we

CUT TO

INT - HONEYCOMB 3 - DARK 112
SARAH leads the way as she and BETH flee the scene But BETH
stumbles and falls By the time she looks up SARAH has gone
INT - HONEYCOMB 2 - DARK 113
SAM and REBECCA run and keep running driven by fear

CUT TO

INT - HONEYCOMB 1 - DARK 114

Pick in hand JUNO lunges again at the creature which is trying
to drag HOLLY away Shrieking at JUNO’s aggressive stance the
creature lashes out at her with sharpened talon-like finger
nails ducking and writhing to avoid the swing of JUNO’s pick as
the two of them engage in a tug of war over HOLLY’s bleeding
body The creature has her head and shoulders while JUNO has
one hand on her ankle But the creature is very strong and JUNO
begins to lose her grip because of the thick gouts of blood
oozing between her fingers

JUNO is spitting blood in a violent rage when a second CRAWLER
lunges out of the darkness at her grappling her to the ground

Still managing to hang on to HOLLY’s ankle even with the new
CRAWLER on top of her JUNO wages a furious war

She hacks away at the CRAWLER as HOLLY is dragged away still
weakly struggling

CUT TO

INT - HONEYCOMB 2 - DARK 115

Panting and exhausted REBECCA and SAM emerge into an unfamiliar
CHAMBER Realization dawns on SAM

SAM
Where are the others
INT - HONEYCOMB 3 - DARK 116

BETH gets to her feet disoriented lost and afraid not knowing
where SARAH has gone

She hears JUNO’s struggles echoing through the cave drawing her
attention

CUT TO

INT - HONEYCOMB 1 - DARK 117

JUNO watches horrified as HOLLY is dragged away by ‘SCAR’ the
CRAWLER she maimed She smashes the pick into her attacker long
enough to get it off her as she scrambles after HOLLY but its
not long before the attacker leaps on her back pulling her
hair trying to sink its teeth into her neck

CUT TO

INT - LAIR - DARK 118

Still running SARAH stumbles blindly in the darkness the
ground drops away beneath her and she slides down a long and
slippery gradient toward a precipice She can’t stop

She falls but only about ten feet her head hitting the
coldwet stone with a sickening thud She doesn’t move

CUT TO

INT - HONEYCOMB 1 - DARK 119

JUNO rolls onto her back on top of the CRAWLER smashing her
head back into its face before turning over driving her knee
into its solar-plexus and with fury in her eyes bringing the
pick down upon its head This is pure uncontrolled rage as she
drives the sharp pick into the creature’s brain again and again
pummelling it to jelly until the CRAWLER finally stops
twitching

Seething with adrenaline grief and hate JUNO sits atop her
kill breathing deeply sweating shuddering

She stands and takes a deep breath Silence Then She senses
movement behind her

She whirls around swinging the bloody pick toward her new
attacker

WHACK

It’s an uncontrolled adrenaline-fuelled reaction and JUNO’s
face instantly turns from one of anger to one of stupefied
horror as she finds BETH standing before her looking at her
with a blank expression upon her face

Neither of them know quite what has happened until BETH drops to
her knees pulling JUNO with her because the point of her PICK
is embedded in BETH’s neck and JUNO in shock can’t control
her body enough to let go

Only as BETH slumps to the ground does the PICK finally comes
free BETH is still alive blood gushing from her neck JUNO
staggers back in horror at what she’s done The sound of
CRAWLERS shrieking before her advancing she must get out of
there and quickly

BETH looks at her incredulous knowing what she is going to do
She reaches out to JUNO but JUNO backs off It’s her or Beth
Law of the cave

JUNO
I can’t save you

BETH pants desperate hearing the crawlers her hand to her
neck sticky with her own blood

BETH
You can help meJUNO FUCK YOU JUNO
HELP ME YOU CAN’T LEAVE ME LIKE THIS

JUNO backs away turns and runs

CUT TO

INT - HONEYCOMB 2 - DARK 120

REBECCA and SAM come to a stop listening to see if they are
being followed

REBECCA

Stop
SAM

What happened to the others
REBECCA

I don’t know We have to go back

A shriek pierces the darkness

SAM
Fuck that

REBECCA
They’re still following us come
on

REBECCA pulls SAM after her and we

INT - LAIR - DARK 121

The CAM-CORDER is lying on its side filming SARAH lying
unconscious Her eyelids are flickering We ZOOM in one the VIEW
FINDER and

CUT TO

INT DARK SPACE - FLASHBACK 122

We see the same image again five candles JESSICA Darkness In
the background indistinctly we see PAUL and SARAH smiling over
JESSICA’s shoulder Nightmarishly discordantly we hear the
strains of ‘HAPPY BIRTHDAY’

CUT BACK TO

INT - LAIR - DARK 123

SARAH wakes up and doesn’t know where she is Her HELMET LAMP is
smashed and her TORCH nowhere to be found All she can reach is
HOLLY’S CAM-CORDER

The first thing she spots is an old MINING lamp a name painted
roughly on its side - ‘TAYLOR’

She activates it and looks through the INFRA-RED view finder at
a horrifying sight Human remains - a skull and next to it
parts of a skeleton Beyond that more human remains mixed
among the animal carcasses and bones

The cavern is like some kind of underground ABATTOIR Fresh
animal carcasses old and new litter the room dumped here from
above ready to be stripped and devoured Giant Elk deer even
a cougar lie with their throats ripped out blood everywhere
It’s a vision of Hell

SARAH uses the camera to assess the cavern and find a way out
when she hears a noise from the gallery above (where she fell
down) She rapidly backs into its darkest shadows directly
beneath the gallery

There are more noises from above then silence and suddenly
HOLLY’s CORPSE is dropped right in front of her SARAH recoils
in shock as HOLLY blood-soaked and battered lies there
staring back at her

A SNAP LIGHT attached to her belt is still working and fills
the cavern with an eerie GREEN GLOW

CUT TO

INT - HONEYCOMB 1 - DARK 124
JUNO staggers against a wall and throws up

Behind her the sounds of CRAWLERS echo through the tunnels She
hurries on and we

CUT TO

INT - HONEYCOMB 2 - DARK 125

REBECCA and SAM are hurrying away from the sound of the
CRAWLERS when REBECCA spots a LEDGE up in the side of the
tunnel

REBECCA
Up there Hurry

They waste no time in crawling into the tight space in the hope
that the CRAWLERS may overtake them in the darkness As they go
SAM drops the BLUE CHEMICAL SNAP LIGHTS she is holding and they
clatter to the floor of the tunnel She tries to go back for
them but REBECCA grabs her

REBECCA (contd)
Forget themhurry

The two women crawl onto the high ledge switch off their
TORCHES and HELMET LAMPS and lie silently on the ledge SAM
behind REBECCA in front with only the BLUE glow of the SNAP
LIGHTS to give them any sense of comfort

CUT TO

INT - LAIR - DARK 126

SARAH hears a new sound from all around A lower less
aggressive rasp as several CRAWLERS emerge from the shadows
into this LAIR and approach the fresh meat of HOLLY’s CORPSE
SARAH freezes and waits

SARAH can only cower and watch through the CAM-CORDER as the
CRAWLERS gather around the fresh kill and begin ripping it
apart SARAH closes her eyes gagging

But one of the CRAWLERS ‘SCAR’ between SARAH and HOLLY’s
corpse smells something new and turns its attention toward
SARAH

SARAH sensing something close opens her eyes to see (through
the CAM-CORDER) the CRAWLERS face inches from her own its eyes
closed sniffing the air SARAH holds her breath The CRAWLER
opens its eyes wide to reveal two yellow eyeballs

Following its nose the CRAWLER rises upwards to the rock face
then turns its attention back to the main course but SARAH is
trapped

CUT TO

INT - HONEYCOMB 2 127

REBECCA and SAM lie silently together as they hear the sound of
something approaching It’s a CRAWLER moving cautiously
hunting by sound searching for them

SAM gasps and REBECCA quickly puts her hand over her mouth
The CRAWLER is very close climbing along the wall

A gaunt clammy hand touches the rock beside SAM’s face The
CRAWLER is moving along the wall right over them in the semi-
darkness skimming past their bodies It seems totally unaware
of the light source as its yellow eyes seem to glow in the BLUE
GLOW They try to remain absolutely still as the CRAWLER pauses
briefly right next to REBECCA’s face It’s so close she can
taste its rancid breath in her mouth It listens senses
nothing and moves on

REBECCA takes her hands from SAM’s mouth

SAM
It couldn’t see us

The seconds tick by and in time the coast seems clear

Then the terrible bleeping of a digital alarm Along the tunnel
the CRAWLER spins about

SAM (cont’d)
(whimpers )
My fucking watch

SAM struggles and throws the watch as far back along the tunnel
as she can

Almost instantly the CRAWLER rushes past in pursuit of the
noise REBECCA and SAM lie quiet and still not daring to move a
muscle

FADE TO BLACK

DISSOLVE TO

INT - HONEYCOMB 1 - DARK 128

A distant light appears in the pitch darkness heading this way
along dank dripping tunnels

JUNO alone moves cautiously through the maze of caverns
trying to find traces of SARAH REBECCA and SAM Using a
(silent) GREEN SNAP-LIGHT she weaves this way and that
listening out for CRAWLERS PICK in hand ready for anything

Reaching a junction between several interconnecting tunnels she
notices an ARROW scrawled on the tunnel wall It means
something

She looks and listens along each of the tunnels and through one
she can hear the faint whistling of a breeze

A breeze means one thing A WAY OUT

CUT TO

INT - LAIR - DARK 129

SARAH is still trapped and in the semi-darkness lit only by
HOLLY’s SNAP LIGHT all she can hear is the sound of her friend
being torn apart It’s driving her insane but she cannot give
herself away

SUDDENLY from elsewhere the sound of a falling rock echoes

through the CAVERNS then a voicefaint but audible
JUNO
Sarah

The CRAWLERS turn to the sound and in one sudden movement the
pack dart out of the LAIR on the hunt again

SARAH takes a deep breath of rancid air almost gagging on its
foulness

CUT TO
INT - HONEYCOMB 1 - DARK 130
JUNO has arrived at a junction between two tunnels and doesn’t
know which one to take There’s only one thing for it
JUNO

REBECCA Can anybody hear me

CUT TO

INT - HONEYCOMB 2 - DARK 131

REBECCA and SAM hear her

REBECCA
The noise she’s making she’1ll bring
everyone of those things down on her
head

SAM
As long as it’s not on mine

REBECCA
We can’t stay here forever

Together they shuffle out of their hiding place

CUT TO

INT - LAIR - DARK 132

SARAH carefully emerges from the shadows now that the coast is
clear She edges toward the fractured remains of HOLLY

SARAH
I’m sorry

Carefully she pulls the PICK HANDLE (used as a makeshift splint
on Holly’s leg) free from the blood and gore steaming in the
cold darkness It’s a grisly job Once that’s free SARAH now
lifts HOLLY’s upper body so she can remove her outer layers of
clothing

It’s tricky icky awkward work but SARAH finally manages it
and allows HOLLY’s body to slump back to the ground Now she
wraps the clothing around the end of the PICK handle then grabs
the MINERS LAMP unscrews the cap and douses her makeshift TORCH
in oil

Finally she takes out a lighter and strikes it up lighting the
TORCH and filling this killing house with a hot flickering
orange glow

Unable to climb out the way she fell in she moves deeper into
the LAIR carefully treading between the detritus of death

CUT TO

INT - HONEYCOMB 1 - DARK 133

JUNO finds another ARROW and again follows it backwards to
another junction and yet another ARROW

JUNO
Rebecca Sarah

Shes forgetting herself carried away by the possibility of
hope But that hope is shattered by the sudden SHRIEK of a
CRAWLER in reply to her calls

CUT TO

INT - HONEYCOMB 2 - DARK 134

REBECCA and SAM hear this too They freeze and throw themselves
against the wall carefully edging toward the corner from where
the SHRIEK came from This CRAWLER is getting closer

Carefully slowly REBECCA peers around the corner breathing
hard and fast the sweat running from her brow but the
tunnel is empty

SAM is looking the other way covering their rear as REBECCA
turns back

REBECCA
It’s clear

They turn the corner but as they do the CRAWLER appears not
from below but from above It is hanging upside down from the
roof and it lashes out at REBECCA slashing her across the
shoulder She gets clear in time to swipe back at it with her
PICK but misses In the BLUE of her SNAP LIGHT the CRAWLER
opens its yellow eyes and SHRIEKS loudly at them

REBECCA (contd)
SHIT

REBECCA backs away SAM behind her but the CRAWLER keeps pace
with them dogging them as they retreat REBECCA swipes the PICK
at it whenever it gets too close

But they quickly find themselves cornered backed up against a
wall with nowhere left to run If they try to move left or
right the CRAWLER counters them

REBECCA (contd)
Samwhen I sayrun

SAM
I won’t go without you

REBECCA
Just do it NOW

In desperation REBECCA lunges at the CRAWLER swiping with her
pick with her LEFT hand The CRAWLER backs off and SAM runs for
it

Almost immediately SAM runs into something (OFF SCREEN) and
comes to a startled halt

REBECCA swings the PICK at the CRAWLERS head but the CRAWLER
grabs it and pushes her back against the WALL holding her by
the throat and opening its WIDE JAWS ready to take a bite
SUDDENLY another PICK comes whooshing out of the darkness
spinning through the air and embedding itself in the CRAWLERS
back

The CRAWLER buckles backward trying to pull the PICK out from
between its shoulders

REBECCA looks up just as JUNO (followed by SAM) appears from the
shadows beyond then she drives her own PICK into the CRAWLERS
chest and all three women attack the beast with whatever comes
to hand The CRAWLER lets out a piercing shriek like a cry for
help as it goes down beneath the blows

CUT TO

INT - LAIR - DARK 135

SARAH hears the cry It sends a shiver down her spine as she
stops listening waiting

CUT TO

INT - HONEYCOMB 2 - DARK 136
JUNO finishes it off by caving its skull in with a rock Bloody
and desperate the three exhausted women look at each other a
new found understanding between them

CUT TO

INT - LAIR - DARK 137
SARAH feeling more confident moves on carrying her burning
torch She is still making her way through the low hanging
vaults of the LAIR nervously looking around expecting the
CRAWLERS to return at any moment

CUT TO

INT - HONEYCOMB 2 - DARK 138

JUNO and REBECCA share a quick tight embrace

REBECCA
We heard you calling for Sarah You
seen Beth

JUNO
cece She fell I lost her I don’t
think she made it

The women are silent No one can find anything to say as the
horror of the situation settles over them Then SAM looks down
at the mutilated CRAWLER the first one they have seen up close

JUNO (contd)
What is it Sam

SAM
I don’t know but it looks almost
human

REBECCA

Not anymore it doesn’t Come on We
have to find the others

JUNO
Wait Take a good look at it Sam Tell
us what we’re dealing with here It
might help us fight them

SAM
Well it’s almost totally blind and
judging from what we’ve seen Id say
it uses sound and smell to see with
and hunt with like a bat It’s
perfectly designed to live down here
in the dark And it got some sort of
blood infection thats what makes it
yellow Jaundice

REBECCA
How did it get here

JUNO
People lived in these caves the ones
who did the paintings

REBECCA
What These things ATE the cavemen

SAM
No They evolved I think they ARE
the cavemen

They look at each other the horror of this possibility dawning

on them

JUNO
Whatever they are they come and go to
the surface to hunt right They bring
their food down here to eat If we can
stay quiet enough and evade these

fuckersI think I’ve found the way
out

REBECCA
You THINK

JUNO

The climbing gear we found Whoever
brought that in here marked their
route so they could find their way
back out I’ve found the markings

SAM
So what are we waiting for

JUNO looks back at her

JUNO
SarahWe have to find Sarah

CUT TO

INT - LAIR - DARK 139

SARAH scans the entire LAIR sweeping the torch back and forth

looking for Beth

As SARAH heads down toward the far end of the LAIR she stumbles
and falls We TRACK across the sea of bodies and bones littering

the floor of this cavern towards Sarah

As she starts to pick herself up SARAH realizes her hand is

touching something Something strange She turns

She is touching a HUMAN LEG She clears away some debris to
reveal the rest of the body It’s lying face down but we can
tell it is the body a woman Some of the flesh has been stripped

from the lower legs by razor sharp teeth

SARAH
(whimpering)
Oh god oh god

Sarah already knows who it is but she reaches out anyway to
turn BETH’s body over revealing the gaping neck wound inflicted
by JUNO

SARAH
Beth

SARAH raises BETH’s upper body from the ground and cradles her
in her arms

As she lowers BETH’s body back to the ground Beth’s eyes SNAP
OPEN She’s not dead yet Not quite

Sarah jolts in shock BETH’s words are hissed out in a hideously
laboured rasp

Take this

BETH removes the WHISTLE from around her neck and hands it to
Sarah Their hands touch as SARAH takes it from her TEARS
streaming down her face SARAH places the whistle around her
neck and tucks it into her top just like BETH wore it

In the distance we hear the shriek of a Crawler

BETH
Don’t leave me like this

SARAH
What

BETH looks at her intently

BETH
Don’t leave me like this

CLOSE on SARAH as she realizes what BETH is asking her to do

SARAH
Close your eyes

SARAH reaches down and finds a JAGGED ROCK As she raises it we
CUT TO

WIDE SHOT Sarah’s tiny figure as she brings the ROCK down ina
smooth merciful arc

CUT TO

ECU OF SARAH’S FACE EYES CLOSED EXPRESSIONLESS

She hears a noise from elsewhere in the cavern and grabs her
TORCH swinging it around to see a lone CRAWLER stealthily
creeping up on her about 20 feet away

With a valedictory glance at BETH’s dead body SARAH bolts for
it running as fast as she can toward the first available exit
She’s a machine

She spots a tunnel and heads for it but before she can reach
it the floor of bones gives way beneath her

The lower end of the LAIR is a drainage pool stacked high with
animal carcasses thick with clotted blood and covered in so
much dust and debris it looks like a solid floor but it’s about
4 or 5 feet deep

SARAH plunges headfirst into this blood-pool her torch flying
from her hand and landing on the far side

When SARAH surfaces again all trace of her beauty and humanity
have vanished She is covered in blood After this Hellish
baptism SARAH is now as frightening as anything else in the
cave

She looks around trying to spot the CRAWLER but there is no
sign of it She turns and heads for the tunnel but almost
immediately the CRAWLER bursts up out of the blood-pool in front
of her bloody as Hell

It grabs her and the two of them disappear under the surface
together

For a moment the surface of the pool goes calmthen they re-
emerge engaged in a ferocious battle lashing out at each
other in savage fury They have each other by the throat
squeezing tightly The CRAWLER is stronger and tries to force
SARAH’s head under again As she goes she reaches around with
her free hand trying to find something anything she can use
as a weapon

Just as her face disappears beneath the surface and blood flows
into her gasping open mouth she grabs hold of a RIB BONE and
thrusts its sharp broken tip into the CRAWLER’S eye

The CRAWLER wails and SARAH spits out blood pushing the RIB
BONE deeper and deeper into the CRAWLER’S eye socket forcing
the CRAWLER underwater and keeping it there until it stops
struggling

Exhausted SARAH fights her way to the edge of the pool and
with great effort hauls herself out onto the rim where she
collapses face down gasping in air

Then just beyond her we see something move Another CRAWLER
has entered the LAIR SARAH looking toward us becomes aware of
its presence and freezes still She’s still covered in blood
much like everything else in the lair

She stays absolutely still as the CRAWLER sniffing the air
moves along the edge of the pool toward her

Then the CRAWLERS hand rests on SARAH’s head as it sniffs the
air listening for signs of life

After a moment it moves on and SARAH very slowly very
carefully reaches out toward a massive ELK THIGH BONE lying
nearby

The CRAWLER comes up close sniffing the air before us and
behind it we can see the crimson form of SARAH rising up
slowly menacingly like some savage goddess

SARAH takes a deep breath and lets it out the CRAWLER sniffs
the air sensing the new smell and turns back toward SARAH just
as she brings the THIGH BONE crashing down on its skull again
and again her eyes blinded by blood and rage

Finally she stops and slumps down Drained

Then she hears it the distant SHRIEK of many CRAWLERS coming
from all around her

She looks up with eyes now cold and merciless

SCENE DELETED 145

INT - HONEYCOMB 2 - DARK 146

JUNO REBECCA and SAM hear the SHRIEK too but for them it is
much closer and coming their way

JUNO
Go on follow the markings hurry

REBECCA and SAM hurry off finding the ARROWS and following them
backwards JUNO waits behind wanting to be certain that the
CRAWLERS are coming after them She shines her torch along the
tunnel into the darkness moving slowly forward as the SHRIEKS
get louder growing in numbers

JUNO (contd)
SARAH 1

Then she sees them all of them CRAWLING out of the darkness
toward her en masse Moving fast on all fours along the
ground the walls and the roof of the tunnel twenty or more of
them heading this way At the front of the pack is SCAR

JUNO turns -

her

JUNO stares hard at REBECCA knowing she’s probably right

REBECCA (cont’d)
Come ON

SAM runs off ahead while REBECCA waits to see if JUNO is
following

REBECCA (contd)
SAM Wait

Once she sees JUNO’s light coming she takes off after SAM
CUT TO

Now WE too are running along the tunnels as fast as we can
weaving this way and that first ahead of them then behind SAM
at the front REBECCA in the middle and JUNO bringing up the
rear stopping briefly to check behind her then taking off
again at speed It’s a frantic chase with the CRAWLERS biting
at their heels

CUT TO

SAM finds another ARROW and follows its course backwards
REBECCA is with her now and JUNO not far behind

CUT TO
SAM runs into a pool of water but keeps on going REBECCA

follows but stumbles falling headlong until JUNO grabs her and
pulls her to her feet

She’s limping now

Then REBECCA notices that SAM has missed a turning and an ARROW
telling them to go in a different direction

REBECCA (contd)
SAM It’s the wrong way

JUNO
Shit Come ON

They follow SAM JUNO supporting the injured REBECCA

CUT TO

INT - CANYON GORGE 2 - DARK 148

SAM crawls on hands and knees through a low tunnel and almost
runs over the edge of this vertical drop but stops herself in
time The tunnel has run out and before her lies a deep gorge
similar to the one REBECCA crossed earlier about twenty feet
across with no way around it

On stopping so suddenly SAM has sent several rocks tumbling over
the edge into oblivion Now she hears them splash down in water
far below

Above her the roof of the cavern arcs over the gorge and
there she sees her chance Emulating her big sister she sees a
crack spanning the roof that could take her to the far side and
she’s desperate enough to try it

She hammers in a piton ties on a safety rope climbs up and
puts her hand into the CRACK clenches it and lets it take her
weight The pain is unbearable and she gasps as we

CUT TO

INT - TUNNELS - DARK 149

tunnel

REBECCA
You go first Stop her I’1l be right

JUNO crawls in first and REBECCA follows

CUT TO

INT - CANYON GORGE 2 - DARK 150

SAM is resolute and determined Shaking with the strain she
pulls herself up far enough to secure the spring loaded GRAPNEL
and hook on her safety line

JUNO emerges from the low tunnel to see SAM is halfway across
the void

JUNO
Sam What are you doing You can’t do
it Come back SAM

SAM looks back at JUNO with a mix of steely resolve and tears in
her eyes the pain she is enduring is unbelievable but she will
not give in

JUNO (contd)
(calling back)
Rebecca hurry

A CRAWLER lets out a loud SHRIEK and JUNO traces the sound
It’s ahead of SAM SAM looks up and sees it coming across the
roof upside down toward her

REBECCA crawls out of the tunnel and sees it too

REBECCA
No SAM GET OUT OF THERE HURRY

SAM looks at the CRAWLER looks at her own situation and knows
that she’s not going to make it back to the near side in time
Then she looks directly at REBECCA across the void No words are
needed REBECCA looks back at her in floods of tears

SAM wedges in one more GRAPNEL hooks her SAFETY line on to it
and with her free hand takes her CLASP KNIFE from its sheath
and puts it between her teeth before moving hand over hand
directly toward the CRAWLER

REBECCA (contd)
What are you doing SAM NO

But SAM has death in mind and she and the CRAWLER meet head on
SAM doesn’t stand a chance hanging above the gorge with only
one free hand but she does manage to take a few slashes at the
CRAWLER until it suddenly lashes out at her and with its claws
rips open her throat

SAM hangs their momentarily in shock as blood gushes out then
she looks up at the CRAWLER hissing back at her upside down

She suddenly swings her legs up and wraps them around the
CRAWLER’S back before letting go with her hand

Now she wraps her arms around its neck and blinded by her own
blood drives her KNIFE into the CRAWLER’S heart

REBECCA can only watch in horror and sorrow as her sister fights
to the death

REBECCA (contd)

The CRAWLER shrieks loudly and cannot hold on any longer The
weight of SAM pulls it from the roof and together they drop into
the abyss

The safety rope reaches its limit and SAM’s body is whip-lashed
to a halt while the CRAWLER keeps falling shrieking as it
falls until it hits the WATER below with a loud splash

SAM is left hanging at the end of the ROPE swinging back and
forth like a pendulum

REBECCA is a quivering wreck as JUNO embraces her forcing her
to look away a tear in her own eye as she looks at SAM hanging
from the end of the rope

REBECCA slumps against the wall as JUNO considers the more
pressing matter of their own survival She stands on the edge
looking down thinking

JUNO
Rebecca We can’t stay here

REBECCA
Then go I don’t care anymore

JUNO
No Rebecca we can still get out We
HAVE to

REBECCA

What does it matter We’re fucked We
were fucked the moment we set foot in
this place

JUNO
I am NOT going to die in this fucking
hellhole

REBECCA

Don’t you understand It’s the cave
IT WANTS US TO DIE IT WON’T LET US
LEAVE

REBECCA is suddenly yanked off her feet She lands face down
the wind knocked out of her

JUNO
REBECCA

The CRAWLERS are here They are pulling REBECCA back into the
LOW TUNNEL

The shock brings REBECCA back to her senses and she claws at
the rock and dirt JUNO grabs hold of her BANDAGED HAND and
REBECCA screams out in pain as she kicks at her attackers But
they grab her feet and pull her deeper into the tunnel

REBECCA
But JUNO can barely hold on to the blood-soaked BANDAGE as
REBECCA is yanked forcefully backward

JUNO
Rebecca hold on

JUNO cries out in rage as REBECCA is yanked free and dragged
kicking and screaming into the tunnel resisting every step of
the way scraping her fingernails across the rocks staring back
into JUNO’s eyes until she vanishes from sight

CUT TO
JUNO backs away from the tunnel toward the edge of the gorge
She knows they’1ll be coming for her next She knows she has
little choice

She doesn’t have time to scale the cavern roof She turns and
looks down Preparing to jump

CUT TO

POV - Coming out of the tunnel toward JUNO’s back closer and
closer until JUNO swallows a breath and leaps into infinity

CUT TO

JUNO drops away into the pitch darkness Silence The vast
deadly silence of the cave

She disappears for what seems like an eternity until we

Looking upward from below as a faint glow appears growing
closer until JUNO hits the water illuminated by the SNAP LIGHT
she is holding

CUT TO

INT - CANYON POOL - DARK 152

JUNO floats to the surface intermittently lit up by the light
from SAM’s torch swinging back and forth high above her

The pool itself is entirely enclosed with water dripping and
pouring down from the walls above

From one side a small waterfall gushes steadily from a fissure
in the wall dropping about 15 feet into the pool

JUNO dazed by the impact of the fall flounders in the water
Weak from exhaustion she begins to sink as she’s bathed in a
warm fiery glow A hand reaches down to her

SARAH (OS)
Juno Grab my hand

JUNO weakly reaches up and grabs her hand SARAH hauls her up
and out of the water onto the rocks

JUNO looks up at her saviour

SARAH’s hair is hanging down across her face matted and
dishevelled Her clothes what remains of them are tattered and
torn her bare arms and legs stained with blood and laced with
cuts and bruises She looks every inch the primal savage

JUNO

SARAH says nothing as she pulls JUNO up beside her JUNO
instinctively embraces her but as she does she becomes aware of
the matted blood in SARAH’s hair She backs away looking at her
own hands now covered in the same blood

JUNO (contd)
Oh my Godwhat happened

SARAH
I killed some of themRebecca
Sam

JUNO

SARAH says nothing She seems devoid of compassion JUNO looks
at this person before her barely recognizable as the friend she
once knew

SARAH
What about Beth

JUNO
--I’m so sorry Sarahshe didn’t make

SARAH
You saw her die

JUNO

Sarah remains silent half turning to leave

SARAH
Well are you coming or not

There is an air of tension between them now Juno follows warily
as SARAH leads the way up past the WATERFALL and into the
FISSURE as we

CUT TO

INT - HONEYCOMB 3 - DARK 153

Finding HOLLY’s discarded PACK lying on the ground JUNO hurries
over to it and quickly pulls out all the FLARES left in it
About 6 in all She combines them with the 4 she has left SARAH
finds BETH’s PICK and swaps it for her BONE

JUNO
Ten flares

Shrieks fill the caverns JUNO and SARAH move on stealthy as
big cats

CUT TO
JUNO lights a FLARE and throws it down at a JUNCTION before she
and SARAH check the immediate area and move off cautious but

urgent

CUT TO

Behind them they leave a trail of hot burning FLARES filling
the caverns with smoke and throwing the CRAWLERS off their
scent

INT - ASCENDING PASSAGE - DARK 154
SARAH carefully peers around the corner

Looking down the PASSAGE the CRAWLERS are nowhere in sight

SARAH
It’s clear

JUNO doesn’t say a word as she looks back at SARAH and follows
her lead

CUT TO

SARAH holds her FIREBRAND out before her as they follow the
breeze to its conclusion

JUNO holding her PICK follows close behind Always alert
always glancing behind

They are CLIMBING steeply now back up to the surface through
new and uncharted territory drawing them slowly onwards and
upwards

A nerve tingling SHRIEK can be heard behind them They stop and
turn listening

This SHRIEK is close and they’ve nowhere to hide and only one
FLARE left They hurry on

The breeze seems to be getting stronger They are climbing as
fast as they can through this winding meandering passage over
rocks up steep inclines and through pools of gathered water

Then they hear another SHRIEK closer still and then another
and another The CRAWLERS are so close

They turn to hurry onward only to find the way ahead blocked

FOUR CRAWLERS lie in wait for them ‘SCAR’ at the front It’s a
trap

JUNO strikes up the LAST FLARE and the first CRAWLER immediately
launches itself from a high rock at JUNO tackling her and
bringing her down in a pool of water

SARAH lets out a fearful guttural ROAR of defiance and keeps
the other THREE at bay with the FIREBRAND thrusting it at them
waving it back and forth in desperation

Behind her JUNO is engaged in a battle royale with the first
CRAWLER Amidst the frenzied movement and splashing of the water
it is difficult to tell the two violently thrashing forms apart
as JUNO pounds at the CRAWLER with her PICK

The other THREE are quickly learning to outwit SARAH by
surrounding her As she keeps TWO at bay the THIRD attacks her
from the rear

SARAH and JUNO have both descended into pure savagery This is a
brutal almost primordial struggle between two species Neither
side is about to go down without taking the other with it

SARAH smashes her PICK into the side of her first attacker
followed by a kick in the head from her heavy boot But this
leaves an opening for the other TWO to launch themselves at her
driving her to the ground and knocking the FIREBRAND from her
grasp

JUNO and the FIRST CRAWLER are now pummelling away at each other
in a pool red with blood from both of their wounds Eventually
JUNO sees an opening and smashes the CRAWLER across the jaw with
the PICK shattering the handle and the creatures face - She
grabs its limp form and smashes the skull of her attacker
repeatedly against the rock with her bare bloody hands

SARAH swings her PICK punching with her free hand and lashing
out with her feet kicking anything that gets in her way She
now has TWO CRAWLERS on top of her and is fighting like a tiger

JUNO distracts ‘SCAR’ and they face off together circling each
other leaving SARAH one on one

The two of them go at their attackers hammer and tongs laying
into them with every ounce of strength they have left - The
ferocity of their attack is more than a match for the CRAWLERS
who rip and tear at the womens exposed skin

But the CRAWLER gets the advantage over SARAH and strangling
her holds her head under water

‘SCAR’ lunges at JUNO and she ducks and rolls grabbing the
FLAMING BRAND and shoving it into the CRAWLER’S wide open jaws
‘SCAR’ shrieks wildly as JUNO still holding the FIREBRAND gets
to her feet and stands over the hideous beast bringing the
point of her PICK downward driving it into her nemesis’ brain

At the same moment SARAH manages to grab a rock and smashes it
into the creature’s head crushing its skull

Finally it’s over

The two women stare at each other and they no longer recognize
their former selves in the apparitions that now stand here
filled with blood lust

They have become consumed by the darkness

Only now after the fight can we see that BETH’s WHISTLE is
hanging out of SARAH’S top JUNO sees it and knows its
significance SARAH sees that Juno sees The two of them lock
eyes JUNO eyes the WHISTLE nervously

JUNO
Sarahit was an accident I swear
it

SARAH

Cross your heart and hope to die

Then a loud shrieking from close by JUNO turns to look The
PASSAGE is filled with CRAWLERS Waiting to strike hungry for
the kill SARAH and JUNO are beyond exhaustion and cannot hope
to outrun them or fight again They are doomed

JUNO looks back at Sarah just as in SLO-MO we see
A PICK swings downward in a sweeping arc impacting with flesh
and bone The two women stand face to face JUNO convulses in
shock eyes wide SARAH’s face betrays no emotion This is a
cold calculated deliberate killing
Without a word SARAH breaks off and runs for it JUNO collapses
in agony the PICK protruding sideways from her KNEE She’s not
going anywhere and the CRAWLERS are closing in She is easy
meat

CUT TO

SARAH never looks back as JUNO screams at her

JUNO
FUCK YOU FUCK YOU

Then the CRAWLERS swarm in on top of her

JUNO (contd)
AND FUCK YOU TOO

CUT TO

Juno wrenches the PICK from her own knee and makes her stand as
she’s enveloped by a seething mass of CRAWLERS

she falls

There is a sense of calm about her now as if she’s lost to some
twisted inner peace her eyes glazed over staring up at the
light

In time she looks around and sees bones human bones not just a
few but hundreds maybe thousands piled up against the wall
like a giant waste tip The bones are ancient brittle and
white Among the bones lie items of Native American
paraphernalia

But finally her attention is drawn to the source LIGHT that
shines on her High above at the top of the BONE MOUNTAIN
daylight is shining in through a cleft in the rock

SARAH gazes up at it drawn to it the way out

She begins to scramble up the mound of BONES clawing her way
upward on hands and knees toward the light

At last and with extreme effort she reaches the top and climbs
up through the narrow CLEFT toward the daylight beyond

she breaks down she brings the vehicle to a sudden stop in the
middle of the empty highway

drawing her legs close her knees to her chin rocking back and
