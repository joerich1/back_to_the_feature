SHERRY (CONTD)
You know where the power lines go

So Sherry said you couldn’t come be-
cause your dad’s real strict or
some thing

MAREN
He’s like that I don’t know why I
crawled out a window

KIM
Does he worry you’re going to get
kidnapped or something

Kim’s tone hovers between slightly bitchy and slightly bored
Maren shrugs

MAREN
That might be a relief for him But
your dad must worry plenty--

Sherry’s eyebrows go up But Kim takes Maren’s sarcasm in
stride is pleased even

KIM
Not even He wouldn’t pay a dime to
get me back Or my sisters My bro-
ther is a different story

SHERRY

seeing they’re talking about something serious Sherry knocks

on the table and Kim looks up She shows Kim her nails

Jackie looks at Sherry who is a bit stung Maren closes her
eyes not wanting to be pulled into these social currents

paint her nails Maren opens her eyes Kim’s looking at her

Maren really does look odd taking shallower breaths now

or pictures even My dad won’t tell
me anything

KIM
I want to move I’m going to di-
vorce my family when I’m old e-
nough You can do that you know

Maren looks at her again at her face her neck Kim mistakes
this for envy or attraction She smiles used to it

SHERRY (05S)
Try that It’s “Copper Fever”

Kim pulls her hand back under the table to look at one still-
wet painted nail Maren watches vaguely

KIM
It’s too orange

Kim shows off her hand to Maren who pulls it toward her as
if to kiss it Sherry and Kim trade a puzzled look through
the table But when it reaches Maren’s mouth she bites Kim’s
finger breaking skin Kim tries to sit up knocking her head
on the underside of the glass She starts to scream punching
Maren with her other hand Maren strips the skin off the fin-
ger Jackie vomits Sherry pulls on Maren’s legs shouting

When the waitress leaves she continues the conversation

Her dad just looks at her and slowly shakes his head

MAREN (CONTD)
They already asked me why I don’t
have any extracurriculars

MAREN’S FATHER

time

EXT MD HOUSE DRIVEWAY -- NIGHT

They pull into the driveway They’re no longer driving the

INT MD HOUSE KITCHEN -- DAY

She comes into the kitchen An envelope sits on the table

ing to collapse inward

INT MD HOUSE MAREN’S FATHER’S ROOM -- DAY

As the tape begins to PLAY Maren stands in front of her fa-
ther’s closet It is half empty He’s taken only what he
needed His canvas work jacket hangs there also left behind

MAREN’S FATHER’S VOICE

want you to make sure this tape is
good and destroyed Don’t keep it
because it’s got my voice on it
Shooting Script 23 July 2021 10

EXT MD HOUSE ATTIC -- DAY (FLASHBACK)

Maren’s father sits up in the low-ceilinged attic of the ren-
tal house There’s no room to stand but it’s contained up
here maybe making it easier to do what he’s doing

MAREN’S FATHERS VOICE
You aren’t going to see me again I
can’t --help you anymore I can’t
do anything else either go to the
cops or whatever somebody might do
in my place So I’ve gotta leave
you to figure it out for yourself
You know what I mean now

INT MD HOUSE MAREN’S BEDROOMHALLWAY -- NIGHT

Maren lies in bed shaking Her life has turned painfully
She’s alone now and awake to how dangerous this is She gets
up and goes into her father’s room She burrows herself under
his work jacket to try to sleep there instead

MAREN’S FATHERS VOICE
I don’t know how much of what I’m
about to say you remember Maybe
you honestly don’t I’ve never been
sure Some of it goes way back But
just in case I’1ll gonna say every-
thing I know

Female 20 inches long 7 lbs 12 12 ounces” Her father’s
name is there FRANKLIN YEARLY and his place of birth Edgar-
town PA But so is her mother’s name JANELLE KERNS

She looks at her mother’s name a long time tries to smooth
the crease out of it It’s the first time she’s ever seen it
Shooting Script 23 July 2021 11

Next to her mother’s name is her mother’s place of birth
Bagley Minnesota

She stares at the name of the town scared of what she has to
do next She takes the envelope and counts the cash It’s on-
ly seventy-five dollars a whole other kind of betrayal

INT MD HOUSE KITCHEN -- LATER -- DAY

She eats a last meal out of the refrigerator As she takes
out a half-full casserole dish with leftovers she fumbles it
and it drops to the floor and cracks in two She leaves it

When at some point the phone RINGS she doesn’t pick it up
She yanks it off of the wall instead Finally the lights go
out leaving the kitchen dim The power’s been shut off pre-
sumably from an unpaid bill

EXT MD HOUSE DRIVEWAY -- DAY

Maren heads down her street an Army surplus rucksack on her
shoulders full and heavy A neighbor watches her deliberately
miss the school bus but then run to hail a city bus instead

INT CORLIS MD GREYHOUND STATION TICKET COUNTER -- DAY

Maren comes up to a bus station counter where an AGENT sits
She puts a road atlas on the desk and turns it around so she
can point out a tiny dot labelled “BAGLEY” in Minnesota

MAREN
Hi I need to get here What’s the
closest I can get by bus

The ATTENDANT peers at it and then looks in a binder

ATTENDANT
It looks like Detroit Lakes You’1l
have to change buses a few times
Weve only got three stations in
Minnesota From Detroit Lakes you
can probably take a local

MAREN
How much is it to Detroit Lakes

The Attendant looks past Maren to see if she’s with an adult
Then she checks a fare book

ATTENDANT
One way 83 Three transfers Fred-
erick MD Chicago and Minneapolis
Shooting Script 23 July 2021 12

MAREN
How much just to Chicago

ATTENDANT
Shouldn’t you be in school

MAREN
You’d think

ATTENDANT
I don’t know what that means

MAREN
It means I’m 18 in the state of
Maryland and I can decide for my-
self where I should be

The Attendant looks at Maren then says flatly

ATTENDANT
I’1l need to see a driver’s li-
cense Or a Learner’s Permit

MAREN
You can see a birth certificate

The woman checks it carefully and then hands it back

ATTENDENT
Just to Chicago is 49

INT MD TO MD GREYHOUND BUS -- DAY

Maren’s taken a window seat near the back of a full bus She
finishes a pack of Pop-Tarts She’s done some math on the
back of her ticket sleeve with a company golf pencil She
wants to go 1417 miles with 26 left

A RIDER (50s) sits beside her chatting loudly with another
RIDER across the aisle But Maren plugs in to the cassette
tape and presses play as the bus pulls out of the station

CUT TO

Her FATHER’S VOICE rides the roads with her She’s still not
ready for any of this but she knows she needs to hear it

MAREN’S FATHERS VOICE
You were still with your baby
teeth I had a sitter for you then
I worked the late shift Her name
was Penny from our apartment com-
plex I don’t remember her last
name

(MORE )
Shooting Script 23 July 2021 13

MARENS FATHER’S VOICE (CONT’D)
When I came in she was on the
bathroom floor She must’ve been
about to give you your bath as you
were out of your little overalls
and the tub was full There was --
so much blood Her face was chewed
up bad but the worst of it was
her neck She musta been holding
you when you started in on her Her
hands-- all chewed up You were on
the rug next to her I thought you
were dead too like maybe someone
had broken in and done you both--
but you were sleeping When I
turned you over I saw the blood on
your mouth You had something in
your cheek I fished it out It was
soft like a wad of gum With a lit-
tle hole in it where an earring
would go I thanked God she hadn’t
been wearing any You could have
choked

She can hear her father nearly sob but he recovers

MAREN’S FATHER’S VOICE (CONT’D)
You woke up when I had you in the
sink washing you off It didn’t
seem like you remembered You liked
her Penny That’s the part I could
never understand She was your favo-
rite sitter Penny I got the body
out bleached the place twice and
then packed us up and left I don’t
know if they thought Penny had run
off with us or what She was on dis-
ability It woulda been a while be-
fore anyone missed her Far as I
know they never found where I put
her That was the last time I used
our real last name Now you know
why

Maren’s cold inside just staring out at farms and fields an
occasional underpass flashing by

MAREN’S FATHER’S VOICE (CONT’D)
I couldn’t leave you with anyone
but I needed to work I wasn’t a
good enough thief to do that for
Money So I got jobs I could take
you to Nothing happened for a few
years I relaxed

Shooting Script 23 July 2021 14

MARENS FATHER’S VOICE (CONT’D)
You had to start school and I
thought you wouldn’t do it in pub-
lic And you didn’t But you got
clever So fucking clever

Maren’s been in a trance of listening but the sudden anger
in her father’s voice breaks her out of it She stops the re-
corder so hard the cassette pops out and falls to the floor
She scrambles to get it before anyone can step on it

EXT FREDERICK MD GREYHOUND STATIONTICKET WINDOW -- DAY

The bus pulls up outside the greyhound station in Frederick
MD a brick one-room depot beside train tracks

BUS DRIVERS VOICE
This completes service for this
bus Transfer information can be
found on the boards inside

Maren gets off with her rucksack and walks to the depot
which has a service window to the outside She speaks through
the window to the AGENT sitting there

MAREN
Is there a place to get something
to eat

AGENT

Head that way Town’s right there

MAREN
I’m on the bus to Chicago tonight
When do I have to be back

AGENT

got ‘til morning

MAREN

She looks at the ticket She’s misunderstood and is pissed

MAREN
I’1l just wait here if it’s okay

AGENT

at five so just grab a bench
(MORE )
Shooting Script 23 July 2021 15

AGENT (CONTD)
It’s a safe town And the police
station’s that building just there--

He points across a long row of parking lots

AGENT (CONTD)
I’1ll take a drive past here before
I hit the hay as well

MAREN
You don’t have to do that

AGENT
I’1l just drive past If you’re up
I’1l honk at ya I’d sleep better

She tries to read him Is he on her side or about to call
her in as a runaway as soon as her back is turned

EXT FREDERICK MD GREYHOUND STATION -- NIGHT

It’s night Maren lays on a bench in front of the station A
storm’s coming There’s lightning but no thunder It’s her
first night homeless She looks at her Walkman deciding if
she wants to hear more No She gets out a Tolkien paperback
instead

EXT FREDERICK MD GREYHOUND STATION -- LATER -- NIGHT

The first drop of rain hits the page Maren’s reading She de-
cides to move She picks up her rucksack and goes under the

roof over the front entrance When she gets there she noti-
ces a man is standing in front of the station half in shad-
ow but facing her This is SULLY He calls out mildly

SULLY
I didn’t mean to scare ya

The man is in a fishing vest and chore coat emblazoned with
various decorative pins He has no luggage

MAREN
Are you here for the bus

SULLY
No missy I was looking for you
Maybe that sounds weird to you Or
maybe it doesn’t

Maren lets her shoes drop from her hand to the ground and she
starts to put one on She makes her voice sound calm

MAREN
Do I know you
Shooting Script 23 July 2021 16

He starts to walk toward her Not rushing her just walking
She toes her foot into her other shoe

SULLY
Not in the way you mean I smelled
you and you probably smell me now

That’s enough for Maren She scoops up the Walkman and heads
away from him She only gets eight feet when he calls out

SULLY (CONTD)
When’s the last time you fed

This stops her in her tracks She looks back He’s still walk-
ing to her

MAREN
Stop-- Stop there Stop--

He stops

SULLY
You haven’t in months I’d say

MAREN
You-- can smell that

SULLY
You can smell a lot of things if
you know how And we just smell any-
ways whether we ate or not Lord
knows why To find each other may-
be To steer clear I don’t know

He watches her as he pulls a toothpick out of a steel tooth-
pick holder After a moment he turns and starts walking back
toward town in the rain

SULLY (CONTD)
Come on Missy--

Maren’s frozen She has a million questions for this man but
he’s a stranger and he’s trying to lead her away She de-
cides When he’s not looking she picks up a rock the size of
a can of soup and pockets it Then she follows him

EXT FREDERICK MD STREETMRS HARMON’S HOUSE -- NIGHT
They walk along the edge of town and begin up a wooded hill
He chews on a toothpick She can see the top part of his ear

is gone slashed off on a diagonal like an alley cat’s

MAREN
Where are we going
Shooting Script 23 July 2021 17

SULLY
Someplace dry and safe I’m Sulli-
van But friends call me “Sully”

MAREN
I’m Maren You live in this town

SULLY

Nice name Never heard it before
Don’t worry Maren-- I’m ok I got
rules Number one is never eat an
eater It’s a good one Think you
can follow it too I don’t want to
find you gnawing on my elbow all of
the sudden

She sees he’s not kidding

MAREN
I wont

He gestures to a wide-porched house up a small hill

SULLY
Through the back We’1ll talk inside

MAREN
Can’t we talk out here

SULLY
I’1l fix some dinner Look Sully’s
trying to help Is that all right

She looks There are houses on both sides She can see lights
in them People are a scream away if needed

SULLY (CONTD)
Here I smelled you from the yard

MAREN
This far

He goes up toward the house Maren follows guard up
INT MRS HARMON’S HOUSE KITCHEN -- NIGHT

They come into a small kitchen Sully flips on the lights
tosses his toothpick in the trash and puts on an apron Mar-
en sits A half-read copy of James Joyce’s Dubliners is there
on the table

Sully grabs onions and potatoes from a pantry Maren looks
into the living room There are no lights on She can only
make out the shapes of furniture
Shooting Script 23 July 2021 18

SULLY
I’m gonna show you how to make a
Hobo Casserole

MAREN
What’s in a Hobo Casserole Hobos

He looks back at her making his reaction a second joke

SULLY
Use whatever you got to hand Set
the oven on 400 when you start

He finds ground beef in the fridge some carrots and cheese
He grates the potatoes into a baking dish Maren watches

MAREN
Are there lots of us

SULLY
Not lots But more than you’d
think You’ve met a few sure
(off her look)
--that you know of You never had
anyone take a special interest in
you A double-take sorta thing

MAREN
I guess But I just thought--

SULLY

You just thought some people are
creepy and left it at that Girls
have it harder that way You’re not
wrong It’s better if we all stay
clear of one another We’re danger-
ous to non-eaters sure but we can
hurt one another just as bad --I
hope you’re hearing me

MAREN
You sound like my dad

SULLY
Good He find out about you

She nods Sully layers in the ground beef with his bare hands
and tops the whole thing off with shredded cheese and adds
pepper and salt

MAREN
What about you You just basically
said keep away from people like us
but you came looking for me
Shooting Script 23 July 2021 19

He laughs and tosses a pinch of salt behind him

SULLY
Sharp What I smelled was that you
hadn’t eaten And when I saw you’re
just a girl on your own I thought
you might be hungry

MAREN
For casserole

SULLY
No

A beat She looks again into the dark living room Then she
notices a framed sampler reading “BLESS THIS HOUSE”

MAREN
Who lives here

Sully changes the oven racks around

SULLY
Go look

Maren’s head starts to throb What has she walked into
INT MRS HARMON’S HOUSE LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT

Maren turns on a lamp Framed photos grace the walls A coup-
le beside the Grand Canyon decades ago then craning up at Se-
quoias There is a crocheted quilt over the sofa An anniver-
sary clock TICKS on the mantle A cat rubs her leg

She finally sees an old hand-colored wedding photo MR AND
MRS DOUGLAS HARMON JUNE 2 1923 The TICKING CLOCK has be-
come spooky Maren turns and looks down a short silent hall

INT MRS HARMON’S HOUSE HALL -- NIGHT

As Maren comes up the hall she passes an empty guest bed-
room with a pinwheel quilt and dolls on the dresser tops A
basket of knitting yarn sits beside an upholstered chair

She next passes a bathroom with a fuzzy bathmat and a shower
chair like an older person would need The cat slips past
her and into the final bedroom ahead where a lamp is on low
Sully comes to the entrance to the hall behind her

SULLY
Use your nose What do you smell

Maren wants to scream
Shooting Script 23 July 2021 20

MAREN
Is there a dead person in there

SULLY
What do you smell Describe it

She sniffs the air

MAREN
It’s wet --and hot Like soup

SULLY
Good What else

MAREN
But metallic

SULLY
Like blood

MAREN
No Like --mud Something tangy

SULLY
But not like rotten

MAREN
No But close More like vinegar
Vinegar in the soup

SULLY
Yeah --Yeah

Caught between the man behind her and the bedroom in front of
her she takes a slow step forward She soon sees that a wo-

man is lying on the floor next to the bed This is MRS HAR-

MON (80s) Maren takes another step Closer now she can hear
a faint RASP of the woman’s agonal breathing

Maren spooks and backs away fast She gets halfway down the
hall before she’s blocked by Sully

MAREN SULLY (CONTD)
She’s alive We’ll get help-- Missy--

MAREN (CONTD)
What did you do to her

SULLY
I found her like that this morning

MAREN
Youre lying Let me by
Shooting Script 23 July 2021 21

SULLY

I followed my nose I can smell it
especially on an old person You
did too You described it better
than I could

MAREN
I want to go

SULLY
Listen Let me bone down on this
for you Whatever you and I got
it’s got to be fed

MAREN
No --no It was years before my
last time--

SULLY

That’s because you’re young You’1ll
need it more and more

Maren nearly goes to her knees when she hears this so badly
does she not want it to be true

SULLY (CONT’D)
And you won’t always be able to
hold yourself back Maybe you al-
ready know that There’s a reason
you’re on your own isn’t there
Just-- be calm Maybe I should butt
out but I know from living as long
as I have--if the circumstances are
safe and good then eat It’ll last
you a while maybe keep you from
doing something you’d regret more
Even more Missy

Maren cries silently now Sully adjusts his tone

SULLY (CONT’D)

I found her like that and I don’t
think a hospital’s going to help
her old as she is Her mail’s
stacked up a bit so I don’t think
she’s got relations nearby

(sincerely)
I don’t kill people I try not to
That leaves this and things like
it

MAREN
Can I use the bathroom please
Shooting Script 23 July 2021 22

SULLY
Sure

He lets her by She goes into the bathroom and locks the
door He waits a moment and then goes to the door

SULLY (CONT’D)

What I’m proposing is I take the
couch and you take the guest bed I
don’t think it’ll be long now

(beat)
When it’s time the smell will
change I won’t even have to come
get you you’ll know So go and get
right with it Take the spare room
and get right with it

Then he goes down the stairs to give her some room
INT MRS HARMON’S HOUSE HALLGUEST BEDROOM -- NIGHT

Maren comes out and slips into the guest bedroom She shuts
the door and locks it She sits on the upholstered chair A
pearl-button cardigan is draped over its arm She lifts her
elbow off the sweater There’s no chance she’1l use the bed
so she stays in the chair heart racing watching the gap
under the door for any moving shadow

CUT TO
INT MRS HARMON’S HOUSE GUEST BEDROOMHALLBEDROOM -- DAY

Maren stirs awake The sky is blueing up with morning She
looks at the clock at the same moment she smells the change
it’s 612 am and Mrs Harmon has died She hears Sully come
down the hall pass her door and continue on to the main
bedroom After a moment she hears a JERK OF PLASTIC

Theoretically there’s still time to run but her entire re-
ality now is appetite She stands takes the sweater off the
chair and puts it on backwards like a kid in an art class
She goes to the door and steps out Sully is crouched over
Mrs Harmon his back to Maren He’s undressed the body and
put it on trash bags cut open into sheets When she comes
closer she sees he’s into the soft tissue of Mrs Harmon’s
belly chewing and swallowing methodically It is not a
frenzied attack He’s as measured as a man eating in a diner

Maren kneels beside him She picks up Mrs Harmon’s arm and
bites into the flesh there Sully looks at her for a moment
but knows to give her privacy The flesh isn’t cooked so
it’s not like pulling pot roast off a bone It’s work

FADE TO BLACK

INT MRS HARMON’S HOUSE KITCHEN -- DAY

Maren sits at the kitchen table sated Blood covers her face
and hands and is all down Mrs Harmon’s sweater She sees on
the stove the hobo beef casserole now cold

Sully comes in his face a mask of blood as well He sits
next to her at the table vague and shy like an addict

SULLY
Here--

He puts on the table a couple of items of Mrs Harmon’s jewel-
ry a wedding ring and a pink-and-cream locket

MAREN
I’m not a thief

SULLY
Don’t misconstrue

He goes to the living room and gets a valise As he’s leaning
over it a tatter of Mrs Harmon’s flesh falls off the front
of his shirt and onto the floral sofa He looks at it then
dismisses it with a wave

He returns and pulls out something fuzzy and coiled from his
bag a long rope made of what can only be human hair from
dozens of heads Brown curly black blonde straight It’s
beautiful and grotesque a sinister piece of folk murder art
Maren stares at the heavy coil in his hand So many people

SULLY (CONT’D)
This is how I do it It helps me
remember each one I’ve been work-
ing on it for years My great aunt
had a bracelet made out of her hus-
band’s hair when he died That’s
what made me think to start it She
wore it the rest of her days It
was a custom then

MAREN
Your whole life you’ve done it

SULLY
When I thought this up I was about
your age

She reaches out and touches it
SULLY (CONTD)

Pull it if you want It’s strong
You won’t break it
Shooting Script 23 July 2021 24

To show her he uncoils the whole thing and pulls it taut

MAREN
Who was your first You remember

SULLY
Ate my own grandad while they were
waiting on the undertaker

MAREN
Did someone find you While you
were doing it

SULLY
My mama found me afterward She
cleaned me up and told everyone ani-
mals got in and did it This was up
an old road in Georgia Coulda
happened that way Maybe they even
believed her But when I finally
ran off no one came looking for me

MAREN
How do you know

SULLY
I sat up in the woods back of our
place waitin’ to see if they’d
search for me Never happened Wait-
ed four days That’s the worst it’s
been for me--those four days Know-
ing my kin was glad to see me gone

MAREN
You lived on your own since then

SULLY
It’s not hard once someone teaches
you Got to watch yourself and stay
places they can’t book you for vag-
rancy or trespass Woods are best
You can smell cops coming that way

MAREN
How

SULLY
The polish On their badges The
gun oil You just have to practice
Sully’1l show you Now it’s your
turn Missy --Now you disappear

A beat Maren looks at her red hands
Shooting Script 23 July 2021 25

MAREN
What if I don’t want that --What
if I don’t want no one to find me
again

SULLY
You don’t have to be alone You can
bum with me as long as you like

He says it in a way he thinks hides how much he’d like this

MAREN
I’m looking for someone

SULLY
Your mama
(off her surprise)
You mentioned your daddy last night
so I know you must be running from
him or he left you You didn’t say
nothing about your mama though

MAREN
I’ve never met her I just have the
name of the town she was born in
It’s on my birth certificate

He nods They sit in silence The first fly finds them

SULLY
We better clean up before we dry
stuck to these chairs You go Just
leave me some hot water

She gets up to go but at the door turns back

MAREN
Does that mean you only eat women
The hair-- Doesn’t it have to be
long enough to add to the --rope

SULLY
No If it isn’t long enough I just
don’t add it in

He says this with emphasis Maren nods once and goes
INT MRS HARMON’S HOUSE GUEST BEDROOM -- DAY

After her shower Maren’s redressed in the same clothes but
she’s clean and her hair is washed now She can hear Sully in
the shower now SINGING The Blue Sky Boys’ “Beautiful Beau-
tiful Brown Eyes” She is cleaning the blood off her watch
when she realizes the time 915 She finds her bus ticket
Shooting Script 23 July 2021 26

She’s missed it She quickly scans the fine print to see what
happens next

She comes out of the bedroom with her knapsack over her shoul-

EXT FREDERICK MD GREYHOUND STATION -- DAY

Maren runs up to the station One bus is in the parking lot
loading She hurries right up the steps

INT MD TO OH GREYHOUND BUS -- DAY
The BUS DRIVER looks up from where he is counting tickets

MAREN
Where does this bus go

BUS DRIVER
Columbus Ohio Miss

MAREN
I missed my bus this morning to
Chicago Can I ride this one

The Bus Driver looks out at the ticket window where no one
at the moment is sitting

MAREN (CONTD)
I can catch a Chicago bus from
Ohio can’t I Please I need to
keep moving--

He sees the state she’s in and after a moment relents

She takes a seat half way back at the window silently urging
the bus to move When it finally pulls out she sees

MAREN’S POV Sully is on the sidewalk his hair still wet
from his shower watching her leave His expression is hard
Hurt and hard Then he is out of view

She leans her head back on the seat relieved She catches
her breath She checks her nails Just a bit of blood left

MAREN’S FATHERS VOICE
The next few I didn’t see A boy
went missing at a camp you went to
I shouldn’t have let you go but
you wanted to It was just a week
You were 8

Shooting Script 23 July 2021 27

MARENS FATHER’S VOICE (CONT’D)
When that boy went missing I knew
this is who you are I never
thought “what” you are

INT MD TO OH GREYHOUND BUS -- NIGHT

Maren’s left the curtains open so she can see the highway
lights streak by an accompaniment to her father’s VOICE

MAREN’S FATHERS VOICE
You ate them I believe you had to
I don’t know why They found his
pup tent pitched in heavy woods
all bloody inside Luke something--
Vanderbilt If they ruled it a hom-
icide I never heard Vanderwall
Something like that I watched af-
ter to see if you looked sad You
didn’t That was the beginning of
saying no to things Now you know
why for that too

Maren sees the skyline of Columbus glowing on the horizon
She takes out the envelope and sees she’s got only 14 left

INT COLUMBUS OH GREYHOUND STATION -- NIGHT

She arrives on the last bus of the night The station’s empty
except for some homeless people She’s closer to the edges of
society now A man slumped against a wall next to an injured
dog sings Neil Young’s “Helpless” in a dead calm voice He
stops and calls to her

WIDE-AWAKE MAN
You a sweet tooth girl

She looks at him then quickly away She finds an exit

TITLE CARD “OH”

EXT COLUMBUS OH GREYHOUND STATION -- NIGHT

Maren comes out of the station into downtown People here are
camped out in the lees of buildings for the night There is
one cab sitting across the street with its lights on so she
goes over with her rucksack

The TAXI DRIVER behind the wheel looks tired but kind
Shooting Script 23 July 2021 28

MAREN
I just have a question To Chicago
is it faster to go north from here
or through Indianapolis

He looks at her at her rucksack He stubs out his cigarette

TAXI DRIVER
That really what you want to ask

MAREN
I have to get to Minnesota and I
can’t afford another bus I’ve
never hitchhiked in my life --I
don’t even know how it works

TAXI DRIVER
You’ve got no other way I wouldn’t
hitch if you’ve got another way

Maren shakes her head He thinks then hits on something

TAXI DRIVER (CONT’D)
Tomorrow’s Friday Head up this
street about twelve blocks You’1l
see campus Ohio State Ask around
Some kid’s bound to be driving home
for the long weekend It’d be safer
than standing on the side of the
highway with your thumb out And
the student union is unlocked all
night I hope that helps you--

She nods thanks and moves on Without a single better option
she goes

TITLE CARD “IN”

INT IN IGA VARIOUS -- DAY

Maren comes into a rural grocery store She passes aisles of
food household items toiletries When no one is looking
she slips a box of tampons into her rucksack and then some
shampoo

She turns into an aisle and sees a DRUNK MAN in a Stetson
glaring at shelves of canned nuts muttering to himself
Shooting Script 23 July 2021 29

DRUNK MAN
What kind of grocery store runs out
of Lunchables

A MOM pushing her son in a cart turns into the same aisle
from the opposite end The man turns to her

DRUNK MAN (CONT’D)
Whoa You trying to run me down

The Mom keeps moving so as not to further antagonize the man
but he says even louder

DRUNK MAN (CONT’D)
--You deaf I asked you a question
(louder )
HEAR THIS YOU DUMB HO

MAREN
Hey don’t talk to her like that

The drunk turns to face Maren now But someone comes past
her A YOUNG MAN (20s) who strides right up to the drunk with
the bored bravado of someone twice his size This is LEE

LEE
You’re out of control pal

DRUNK MAN
You with the store or something

LEE
Naw but I’m about to escort you
out of it

DRUNK MAN

Fucking see what happens

LEE
What happens You think something
bad’s gonna happen

With a look to Maren Lee comes up and fake headbutts the
drunk man and grabs his hat inflaming him further

DRUNK MAN
Outside I’m taking you outside

Lee leads the drunk man out the opposite end of the aisle and
then Maren is alone again She keeps moving

She finds the canned goods When she’s sure she’s not being
watched she puts a jar of peanut butter in her rucksack as
well

EXT IN IGA PARKING LOT -- DUSK

Maren pays for a pack of gum and then comes out of the store
bracing for someone to stop her No one does The sun’s gone
down leaving a violet sky The parking lot lights come on

And that’s when Maren smells it She glances across the lot

That smell She looks around the parking lot again now real-
izing with surprise what it likely is There are a dozen
cars mostly near the entrance Beyond the lot is a low aban-
doned storefront and then woods

Is the smell coming from one of the cars Before she can de-
cide where to start looking the young man who handled the
drunk earlier LEE slips out of the abandoned building
shirtless and splashes some water on his face and chest from
a water bottle Something about him is different He’s wear-
ing the drunk man’s Stetson He glances at the store entrance
to make sure no one’s coming and sees Maren

They stare at one another a moment and then he comes into
the lot and starts trying a set of keys on cars He looks
closed-off but Maren walks toward him

LEE
It’s a Ford

Maren points past him to a battered pickup truck

LEE (CONTD)
Yeah that’s gotta be it

He starts walking toward it She can see he’s got blood on
his neck He goes to unlock the truck but it’s already open
He tries the engine and it starts He turns it off

LEE (CONTD)
He’s back there about four hundred
yards if you need to--

She shakes her head no

MAREN
You could tell In the store

He gives the barest of nods So she comes a bit closer
MAREN (CONT’D)

I smelled you too I didn’t know I
could do that
Shooting Script 23 July 2021 31

He looks at her uncomfortably He’s amped up in the dull
dumb afterglow of satiation He looks at her rucksack

MAREN (CONT’D)
I’m going to Minnesota I got dump-
ed by a ride I just stole dinner
It’s all I could think to do --You
aren’t local either I guess

LEE
Why does that matter

He growls more than say this Maren shrugs

MAREN
I’m 18 if you’re wondering

LEE
I was going to guess younger

MAREN
Thanks a lot

LEE
Look I don’t usually --talk to
anyone after I don’t actually meet
many others I’m sorta glad not to

MAREN
I get it

LEE
I’m just saying I’m not an asshole

MAREN
You should probably go anyway
Up close you can see blood

LEE
We’re fine

She shakes her head all of it starting to fry her circuits

MAREN
No I really don’t think I am

She’s not freaking out or about to cry but she’s not steady
either He looks at her and then decides

LEE
You wanna get in For a minute--

He goes and climbs in the driver’s side After a moment she
dumps her duffle in back and gets in the passenger side

wallet It should be fine

MAREN
You took his wallet too

LEE
I didn’t take his wallet I took
the money out of his wallet Eight
bucks I chucked the wallet in a
creek back there

She looks at the sky which is tipping into darkness

MAREN

After a pause he says

LEE

I don’t know whether to cry or
scream or laugh or what

LEE
Well don’t scream

MAREN

meet two others in a week

Lee looks at her He’s intense this young man When he looks
at something he’s really looking

MAREN (CONT’D)
It’s like anything else I guess
Youve never heard of it then bam

He looks at Maren at her hands

MAREN (CONTD)
Can you help me I just-- I’m new
at this

LEE
No one our age is “new” at this

MAREN

I’m new at --remembering It all

to sleep in the dark okay --I
know you don’t know me but I won’t
come at you okay And you can pro-
mise the same I don’t want to hurt

now be learning these ropes Some instinct in him kicks in
Against his better judgment he starts the truck and says

How do you live in this country and
not know who Kiss is

He sees Barry’s turntable and foot locker of LPs He crouches
over it until he finds Kiss’ Lick It Up

LEE (CONTD)
Wait Here it is--

He puts it on the turntable When the SONG STARTS it BLARES
so he turns down the volume so as not to announce anyone is
in Barry’s house He then dances around the room and up onto
the couch Maren isn’t sure how to react He grinds out moves
until he smells his sweat reconstituting the blood still on
him He checks himself in a mirror there and says

LEE (CONT’D)
I’m gonna take a shower

glances down and sees a porn mag open to some peroxide hor-
ror She sits then stands again unable to relax in this

He shrugs It’s been a while since he’s had a stranger’s full
attention pointed directly at him like this

Shooting Script 23 July 2021 42

LEE
No Our great Heavenly Father would-
n’t want us on our best days Hell

She looks at him stung by this He looks back

LEE (CONTD)
Or are you gonna tell me you ran
away from a loving home

This is hard for Maren to talk about so she doesn’t All she
says is

MAREN
I didn’t run away

LEE
I’m not trying to start anything
I’m just saying what I think You
would have eventually I can’t
promise that but I believe it We
can’t stay I haven’t met a single
one of us who stayed

Maren watches the Kentucky shore coming closer There are
houses over there pretty well-loved houses maybe with pret-
ty well-loved kids Behind her a sign on a door to the
wheelhouse reads “LIFE JACKETS INSIDE”

MAREN
No

The dining table is stacked with files

MAREN (CONTD)
What’s going to happen to all this

LEE
My mom’s cleaning it out but she’s
got school She’s a teacher

Maren goes to a light switch

LEE (CONT’D)

INT LEE’S AUNT’S HOUSE DINING ROOM -- DAY

Maren comes in as Lee is laying out fast food for them He’s
in high spirits really elated

LEE
Take whatever you want

He’s laid out sandwiches in a line all in cheery wrappers

MAREN
It went well

LEE
So fun She’s a natural We only
spent ten minutes behind the mall
then she was ready for real roads

His energy is big infectious It makes Maren smile

LEE (CONT’D)
It’s going to get dark in a bit
There’s a den downstairs We can
block the window and watch some of
those MASH tapes

MAREN
I do love that show

LEE
See See Fuck the Fatherland
We’re having a good time A god
damned slumber party

MAREN
Youre right by the way Your aunt
was pretty boring But why does she
have placemats for hookers

He thinks trying to understand what she might be referring
to then laughs hard He’s about to explain but they hear
the BACK DOOR BANG OPEN and KAYLA comes barging in en-
raged She’s in overalls and her hair tips are dyed a wild
yellow She’s surprised to find Lee isn’t alone She throws a
waded-up ball of paper at Lee hard

KAYLA
Nice work you motard I already
found this note you put in my
purse You’re leaving Already

LEE
Kayla this is Maren Maren Kayla

KAYLA (0S)
I don’t believe you anymore Lee
Where are you always going anyway

LEE

He glances at Maren not enjoying his worlds colliding or
being diminished in front of her in this way

LEE (CONT’D)
Come on let’s go outside--

KAYLA (0S)
I mean-- you’re such a liar Is
there anything you don’t lie about

LEE
I want to talk to you outside--

He marches her out to the back porch Maren can still hear

KAYLA (0S)
You don’t miss me when you’re gone

LEE (0S)
Youre the only person I miss I
call don’t I

KAYLA (0S)
Is that your girlfriend--

LEE (0S)

That’s my friend friend Maybe you
can meet her some other time We
can’t stay I just wanted to take
you driving like I said I would

KAYLA (0S)

this And then he left for good
Don’t you understand Every time

Shooting Script 23 July 2021 46

LEE (0S)

LEE (0S)
I heard you the first three times

KAYLA (0S)
Fuck you Lee Honestly fuck you

Lee comes back in Maren watches him roll his shoulders
trying to let it go

LEE (0S)
Well go tonight She’s not so good
at hiding things And if my mom
finds out I’m here she’1ll come by
next --Let me spare you that

He peels off the shirt His whole demeanor has plummeted
INT PICKUP (KY ROADSIDE) -- DUSK
They get a good few miles behind them before Lee pulls over
At first Maren thinks he’s still upset but he turns on the
dome light and looks at her with a shy smile
LEE
How do you feel about robbing a
place

She knows Lee enough to know this must not be what it seems

MAREN
Whose place

LEE
A company

MAREN
Family owned

LEE
I like that question

MAREN
What’s the answer

fore I have his old set of keys

locks Someday they’1l wise up

MAREN

LEE
Yeah Dale Can’t hear in two ears

They run and hide behind the muddy wall of an outbuilding

MAREN
Are we robbing the safe

He looks at her impressed she’s so up for this

LEE
I can’t get in there But there’s a
cafe for visitors They don’t lock
up the petty cash at night It’s
probably less than a hundred bucks
but we can definitely use it

MAREN
Visitors To a slaughterhouse--

INT HOOKER PROVISIONS CAFE -- NIGHT

They come into a dark cafe Over the counter is a menu board
reading HOOKER PROVISIONS with at least 30 styles of hambur-
ger listed They duck under the counter and head further in

LEE
Wait here Stay down in case he
shines his flashlight in here

He disappears for a long few moments then comes back with a
wad of bills in his hand He gives it to her
Shooting Script 23 July 2021 48

LEE (CONT’D)
You be the bank

She shoves it in her left boot She starts moving back to the
door they came in but he pulls on her sleeve

LEE (CONTD)
Wait I want to show you something

INT HOOKER PROVISIONS BARN -- NIGHT

Lee and Maren have climbed up to barn’s catwalk and sit with
their legs dangling over the edge They look out across a sea
of cows all LOWING and GRUNTING Maren and Lee keep their
voices down BACH plays quietly over the speakers

LEE
Music’s supposed to keep them calm

MAREN
Seems like an admission of some-
thing doesn’t it
(beat)
Do you think your sister has any
idea About you I mean

LEE
She knows something’s up I hope my
mom buys a new car and gives Kay
her old one I just want her to be
able to leave if she wants All you
need is a car that runs

MAREN
If it wasn’t for you know what Id
be stuck somewhere myself

They watch the SECURITY GUARD pass outside oblivious

MAREN (CONT’D)
You ever think Every one of them
has a mom and a dad-- maybe sisters
and brothers Cousins Kids
Friends even

LEE
A language Listen to ‘em--

They listen to the soft LOWING Their hands are side by side

LEE (CONT’D)

MAREN

LEE
She lives there

MAREN
I don’t know I don’t even know if
she’s alive I just know the name
of the town she was born in

LEE
It might take a while to track her
down It might even be a dead end

MAREN
It’s all I have

LEE
Then that’s where we’ll start
(off her look)
I can take you It’s a lot of driv-
ing but I’m up for it if you are
We can take our time See the coun-
try Well Missouri and Iowa anyway

MAREN
I’ve never been to either

She looks at him at how close his forehead is to hers

runs a hand through his hair and then they are kissing Like
everything Lee does it’s intense and careful He takes no

kiss for granted It’s a beautiful first kiss

CUT TO

They are now on the highway doing 50 mph in morning traffic

Maren’s hands are cemented to the wheel at 10 and 2
nervous Cars jockey around them One HONKS

LEE
Ignore them You’re fine You can
go a little faster if you want--
It’s actually safer to go as fast
as the other cars--

MAREN
Are we not safe right now

LEE
Oh my god None of these people
wants to get in an accident Maren

(as Capt Hawkeye Pierce)
A machine has not been invented
that can test my indifference to
that remark

(beat)
Seriously you’ll hate it until you
don’t It’s like that for every-
body You really are doing fine

Her jaw is set as if death is one moment away He puts his
hand in front of her eyes for a split second

MAREN
YOU FUCKING ASSHAT STOP IT

CUT TO
EXT PICKUP (MO STATE LINE) -- DAY

By the time they cross into Missouri Maren is more comfort-—
able at the wheel She’s up to 65 and the honking has stop-
ped She’s still irritated but Lee doesn’t mind He’s sing-
ing along to the radio George Strait’s “Amarillo by Morn-

waterfall People jump and swim Maren and Lee share an Ente-
nmann’s cake they picked up to celebrate They cut it with
Lee’s buck knife The sun’s about to set

Lee says something that makes Maren laugh He’s tracking her
expressions not a-fraid of eye contact At some point she
understands
Shooting Script 23 July 2021 51

MAREN (PRELAP)
It’s gonna be cold again Aren’t

EXT MO CAMPSITE -- DUSK

ter in a few weeks when summer

MAREN
What was your first time like

LEE

MAREN

LEE

ask me questions and pinch me if I
got the answer wrong in places it
would be hard to see What’s the
capital of Idaho shit like that
What five-year-old knows the capi-
tal of Idaho

MAREN
What was it like

LEE
A rush I felt like some kind of
weird new superhero --It feels

like that every time

MAREN
Yeah but that only lasts an hour
What about afterward How’d you
feel about it What’d you think

LEE
(dissembling)
I don’t remember much after

MAREN
Bullshit
Shooting Script 23 July 2021 52

LEE
According to you you don’t remem-
ber anything before last month I’m
not just going to tell you what you
want to hear You asked a question

Maren thinks for a moment then shifts her tone

MAREN
Lee would you do something with
me Listen to something with me--

LEE
Sure

But they hear a CAR COMING UP THE ROAD toward their campsite
Instead of passing it pulls in

BRAD (0S)
I told you they’d be back here--

Lee gives Maren a warning look and climbs out of the truck
For the moment Maren stays put The car parks and two men
JAKE (40s) and BRAD (30s) climb out both grinning

LEE
Hey--

BRAD
Hey-- We saw you guys at the swim-
ming hole before

LEE
Oh yeah We saw folks swimming out
there

BRAD

Yeah That hole was fucking cold

JAKE

LEE
Ah Yeah How’s it going man

Jake laughs Brad is in a Dokken concert tee and dirty jeans

JAKE

though you might be in need of some
beer Not many come through here

Jake pulls out a case of Coors then another one

JAKE (CONT’D)

LEE
Let’s get a fire going then

Grab the trash in the truck to get
it started--
INT PICKUP (MO CAMPSITE) -- DUSK

While Lee talks with the men Maren opens the glove compart-
ment In it is Lee’s buck knife She opens it so it’s ready
and puts it in the front pocket of Lee’s hoodie she’s got on

EXT MO CAMPSITE FIRE RING -- NIGHT

The men sit in dirty lawn chairs they’ve brought Brad plays
his banjo singing while Jake harmonizes in low howls

BRAD
I greet the day on my two legs
slide my arms inside these red and
grey tails Push the window open
find the Reverend up and dressed I
fear the Lord but I know best--

Maren and Lee sit on the other side of a fire One case of
beer is already gone Maren holds her can not drinking
Shooting Script 23 July 2021 54

Jake watches her her can Lee drains his and puts his arm
around her to send a signal Maren leans into him Jake
looks away

CUT TO
Jake is in the middle of a story now

JAKE
We ended up back in this part where
there was just camo nets for cover
But you could still shoot a paint-
ball through ‘em so there was no-
where to hide If he’d kept running
a mile he’da made it to the high-
way but he was a fat fuck Close
to passin’ out Asthma maybe Any-
way I took him down easy

BRAD
We checked his car pretty good We
didn’t see an inhaler or nothin’--

JAKE
Youre getting ahead of the story
Bradley

BRAD

Christ just call me the fuck what
I wanna be called--

JAKE
So I’m into this now Pulling meat
bones coming out you know and I
start feeling watched I look a-
round and at first I don’t see him
because he’s standing so still in
the trees but then I spot him and
I’m like what the fuck I mean I
look like the red Devil at this
point and he’s just watching me
like I’m Doug fuckin’ Henning

Brad looks sheepishly at the fire laughing silently

JAKE (CONT’D)
I’m already on my feet running at
him and he pulls a fucking pistol
on me Turns out he’s an off-duty
cop First year on the force

BRAD
We did say we weren’t gonna tell no-
body that--
Shooting Script 23 July 2021 55

JAKE
Right right So he’s a cop I mean
this is middle-of-fuck nowhere in
Barry County So you know not
fuckin’ Serpico I think he’s gonna
take me down but he’s just looking
at me And what’d I say

BRAD
You said “Do me now or get the fuck
gone cause he’s not gonna be no fun
to eat cold”

They both break into a moment of drunken laughter

JAKE
So he says “Go on back to it I
gotta get a better look at this”
So I’m at gunpoint now thinking
this creep is hard for it I’m in
there between this dead dude’s
liver and his whatever’s-next-to-a-
liver and I suddenly feel him right
there crouched down gettin a better
look He didn’t smell like an
eater but there he is so I ask
him if he wants some and damned if
he don’t nod all serious like a
food-stamp kid on samples day

BRAD
Fuck you man

JAKE
So you know what I gave him

Lee looks at Maren who is staring at them both in complete
revulsion Before he can intercede Maren interrupts

MAREN
So you’re not --one of us

JAKE
Abso-fuckin-lutely normal he is
Well clearly not normal--
(beat)
Hasn’t had his Full Bones yet but
I reckon that’s coming soon enough

LEE
“Full Bones”

Jake’s face lights up
Shooting Script 23 July 2021 56

JAKE

When you eat the whole thing bones
and all You ain’t done that yet

(off Lee’s look)
It’s a big fucking deal Like your
first time There’s before Bones
and All and then there’s after You
won’t believe it You done that
yet girl

MAREN
That’s bullshit What you’re talk-
ing about is impossible
(back to Brad)
How many people have you eaten

JAKE
How many Brad I count three

Brad nods the slightest shade of pride in his features

BRAD
Yes miss Three people

Maren drills him with a look
MAREN
And you didn’t have to
(really pissed)
You don’t have to do this

Brad looks at her Lee puts a cautioning hand on Maren’s leg

JAKE
Kind of a groupie I guess

MAREN
Jesus Christ

BRAD
Jake’s teaching me how to smell oth-
er eaters

Maren stands

MAREN
No he isn’t

She walks out of the firelight Lee watches Jake closely

JAKE
You don’t think he can do it
Shooting Script 23 July 2021 57

BRAD
Shit man Is she all right

LEE
She’s still figuring all this out

BRAD
Good thing she’s got you to help

Maren sits in the truck looks at Brad who downs a beer neck
exposed Jake’s smiling He points his little finger at Lee

JAKE

There’s the one who needs the help
Brad You can see it a mile away

(to Lee)
You remind me of every junky I ever
met You look like the kind that’s
convinced himself he’s got this un-
der his thumb But you pull on one
little thread and--

He makes an odd SHU-SHU-SHU sound gesturing like a weaving
is unravelling

JAKE (CONTD)
But maybe love’ll set you free
man Maybe love will set you free

Now Lee holds his reactions He wants to look to make sure Ma-
ren isn’t hearing this but it’s too dark to tell anyway

CUT TO
INT PICKUP (MO CAMPSITE) -- NIGHT

The fire is low now and the two men are passed out in their
lawn chairs Lee makes his way back to the truck He quietly
climbs in to find Maren seething where she sits in the pass-
enger seat holding his buck knife

LEE
I’m gonna put this truck in gear
and roll it back down to the road--

MAREN
We have to kill them --Brad at
least
(off Lee’s look)
You heard him He’s murdering
people--
Shooting Script 23 July 2021 58

LEE
He’s with an eater Those people
would be dead anyway

MAREN
We don’t know that And who knows
what he’s capable of now--

LEE
Are you hungry

MAREN
What No but--

LEE
Then we shouldn’t be talking about
killing anybody

MAREN
But Lee he’s got to be stopped--

LEE
Then well drive into a town and
call the cops

MAREN
And say what

LEE
That two guys approached us at this
camp talking about killing people
Then we hang up and keep driving

MAREN
I’1l do it then--

She reaches for the door handle Lee stops her

LEE
Maren Think about it You see how
they get on each other’s nerves
Id give it two more weeks tops
before Brad wakes up with the other
guy’s teeth in his neck --He’1l
get his I promise he will

Maren still has her hand on the door
LEE (CONT’D)
I don’t want this to touch us We

need to get you to your mom

Something about the words “us” and “we” used like this con-
vinces her
Shooting Script 23 July 2021 59

Lee takes the knife gets out of the truck and creeps over
to the men’s station wagon where he crouches down beside one
of the rear tires Maren watches as the car slowly sinks a
few inches on that side He deflates the other rear tire and
then comes back He climbs in and very quietly wrenches the
truck into neutral

INT PICKUP (MO CAMPGROUND) -- NIGHT
The truck rolls backward softly clanking down the road Lee

watches his side mirror Maren watches the men to make sure
they don’t wake up But Jake’s eyes open peering at them

MAREN
Lee--

Lee looks and sees him then watches the side mirror again so
they don’t go off the road

LEE
Fuck Is he getting up

MAREN
GO LEE GO--

As soon as Lee has enough room he whips the truck around
starts the engine and floors it

Maren looks behind them In the red of their taillights Jake
is right there trying to reach the back gate but he can’t
keep up He gives up with YELL and is swallowed back up by
the darkness

Lee is driving now The sun is close to setting and the cloud-
stacked sky is an intricate fortress of gold light Traffic
starts to slow to a crawl ahead Everyone has on their right
turn signals She checks the atlas
Shooting Script 23 July 2021 60

MAREN
Something going on in Mason City I
guess We’re still a ways from 35--

But then she sees it A billboard CERRO GORDO COUNTY FAIR

EXT NORTH IA FAIRGROUNDS MIDWAY -- NIGHT

They walk hand-in-hand on the busy midway People clutch plas-
tic beer cups push strollers or fix their hair after being
whipped around on rides Unlike in the Mid-Atlantic or even
Appalachia everyone here is white Holding Lee’s hand adds a
sharpness to the scrutiny coming Maren’s way

EXT NORTH IA FAIRGROUNDS FERRIS WHEEL -- NIGHT

They end up on the Ferris Wheel 30’ over the crowds This
carnival isn’t where they fall in love That’s been happening
for twenty pages The carnival is where we ask can these two
kids be happy For the moment they are and it feels like the
easiest thing But when they get to the top Maren leans over
and looks at the drop her body tingling with a safe kind of
fear and tells him

MAREN
I’m hungry Lee

EXT NORTH IA FAIRGROUNDS STALLSBALL TOSS -- NIGHT

They walk among the food and game stalls A group of 12-year-
old girls dances to a-ha’s “The Sun Always Shines on TV” play-
ing on a radio It’s not the sexy teenage dancing of now

just girls jumping up and down

They walk up to a restroom and Maren goes in While Lee waits
in the food line a BOY goes up to the next booth a Ball
Toss game to play The BOOTH MAN squints at the boy

BOOTH MAN
Three tickets three tries

The kid pulls tickets out of his pocket and counts three He
looks up at the prizes stuffed farm animals hanging from
ropes Ducks horses pigs cows and foxes

BOOTH MAN (CONTD)
You’re wasting your money

There’s something in his tone that makes Lee keep watching

The Booth Man takes the first ball and tosses it to the boy
but without warning so the boy misses it and has to run af-
ter it The boy returns and takes his first toss He misses
Shooting Script 23 July 2021 61

The Booth Man hands him his second ball He misses again The
Booth Man smiles as he hands the boy his final ball

BOOTH MAN (CONT’D)
Nobody teach you how to throw kid

The Booth Man glances up and sees Lee watching He says to
the boy but more for Lee’s benefit

BOOTH MAN (CONT’D)
It’s my job to psyche you out

The boy tries a different strategy this time he throws it un-
derhand to get more height It lands in one of the milk cans

BOY
I won I won

BOOTH MAN
Naw you didn’t little man

BOY
But it’s in the can

With some degree of pleasure the man dramatically sweeps out
his arm and points to a list of rules painted onto a board
like commandments The first rule is “NO UNDERHAND THROWS”

BOY (CONT’D)
What does that mean

BOOTH MAN
What you just did No underhand

The boy is caught between wanting to honor a rule and sus-
pecting he’s been played

BOOTH MAN (CONT’D)
You can read can’t ya Now go on
Unless you got three more tickets

The boy goes to his pocket but knows he shouldn’t He keeps
himself from crying and leaves Lee steps forward to the Ball
Toss booth

BOOTH MAN (CONT’D)
Hey man You tryin’ to win one for
your girlfriend I saw you walk up

LEE
She’s just a friend You know

The Booth Man hands him a ball Lee tosses and it goes in
Shooting Script 23 July 2021 62

LEE (CONTD)
Can I win a second prize if I sink
it again

BOOTH MAN
You’re not supposed to --But no
one has to know You know

His flirtation is unmissable now Lee tosses and misses

BOOTH MAN (CONT’D)
Disappointing

LEE
What’s there to do for fun around
here beside this dumb-ass carnival
After my friend leaves I mean

The Booth Man hands him his last ball and says eyes on Lee
BOOTH MAN
I close up at eleven I got some
weed in my car--
Lee smiles and gives him a small savage nod He tosses the
third ball and misses again But the man goes and fetches the

ball and plops it into a milk can

BOOTH MAN (CONT’D)
Lucky lucky

LEE
My luck’s not gonna run out is it

BOOTH MAN
Naw man I’1l see that it don’t
Which two do you want

LEE
Gimme two foxes

The Booth Man pulls them down and hands them to Lee

LEE (CONTD)

Maren and Lee sit in the pickup lights out having moved it

to the back of the parking area The lights of the last rides
go off They are sitting together with their heads touching

They are sharing a pair of headphones

MAREN’S FATHERS VOICE
I can’t protect you anymore And
Maybe I shouldn’t Maybe no one
should I hope there’s some kind of
answer out there for you I do I
just know I --can’t be part of it

Lee looks upset by what he’s hearing He reaches over and
takes Maren’s hand

MAREN’S FATHER’S VOICE (CONT’D)

nights sick to death wondering
Hoping Hoping whatever troubles
you is over and you’re just a reg-
ular girl with regular problems
and regular pain And you’ve stop-
ped wanting things you shouldn’t
want Maren --And that your heart
has a chance

They wait for more but they hear him switch off the record-
er Lee tries to absorb this but it stinks like shit They

take off the headphones and sit in silence for a moment He

looks at her He tries to find some words but can’t Some-

how she’s dry eyed She’s grown up a lot in a week

MAREN
I knew that’s how it would end I
hope you get better --Maybe he’s
right and I should pray I wake up
someday to find they’ve built a
maze around me

LEE
Don’t say that Don’t He’s wrong

He puts a hand on his cheek and strokes it She looks at him
in the dark cab
Shooting Script 23 July 2021 64

MAREN
What happened to your dad Lee I
can read between the lines

LEE
Nothing good Just --a waste A big
waste Only in my case I gave him
the tape

He chuckles darkly barely audibly It’s a strange sound com-
ing from Lee When he glances toward the entrance Booth Man
is standing there lighting a cigarette and looking around

MAREN
We should go Lee Barry Cook was
drunk This guy isn’t

LEE
Ill be fine Just-- see where we
go and give me a few minutes Ten
is plenty Gimme ten minutes

Lee gets out and walks across the lot toward the man Maren
slouches down just in case there’s enough light to see her
Lee walks up to him and says something Maren can’t hear

BOOTH MAN
It’s Lance

Lee again says something Maren can’t hear

BOOTH MAN (CONT’D)
Where’d you come up from

Lee says something that makes the man chuckle Now the Booth
Man lowers his voice as well They walk along the edge of the
cornfield Maren watches as Lee kisses the man She scans the
parking lot to see if anyone else can see this There’s no
one When Maren looks back Lee and the man are making out
Lee motions Booth Man into the rows of corn

Maren looks at the dash clock to wait more minutes but she
can’t She gets out

EXT NORTH IA FAIRGROUNDS PARKING LOTCORN -- NIGHT

Maren walks to where she saw them go into the corn She hears
SOMEONE MOVING AROUND and then some MOANING She ducks into
the corn a few rows and sees

MAREN’S POV Lee’s shirt is off and he’s standing behind the
Booth Man--whose pants are around his ankles--giving him a

handjob Lee is whispering encouragement in his ear but Lee
reaches with his free hand to his back pocket for his knife
Shooting Script 23 July 2021 65

He’s opened it an inch already and pries it the rest of the
way on his leg Then as the man is cumming Lee slits his
throat The man’s orgiastic gasp turns into a blood-clogged
wheeze Lee holds him tight and sinks to the ground with him
While the man bleeds out in the dirt Lee catches his breath

Maren is repulsed by Lee’s easy violence But the fact that
he is using his skill for her eroticizes it too Lee looks
up and has a silent cold reaction to her having seen this

LEE
Here

She goes He makes room beside him for Maren to kneel down in
the corn row But he takes the first bite right into Booth
Man’s chest

EXT PICKUP (IA RURAL ROUTE) -- NIGHT

Lee’s pickup cuts the night with its headlights driving on a
rural road The Booth Man’s car follows behind

INT BOOTH MAN’S CAR (IA RURAL ROUTE) -- NIGHT

Maren drives in that sated daze She follows Lee past a mail-
box He slows but does not turn in He goes a quarter mile
further and pulls over

EXT IA RURAL ROUTE -- NIGHT

Maren parks behind him and waits Lee jogs back and gets in

MAREN
What’s wrong

LEE
That’s the place listed on his
license but there are lights on
I’m going to walk back and make
sure no one’s there

MAREN
Ill go You’ve got blood on you

He turns her face gently in his hands It’s oddly intimate
MAREN (CONT’D)
I cleaned up He had wipes I’1l
see what I can see from the yard

He doesn’t look convinced but he doesn’t protest

LEE
Okay
Shooting Script 23 July 2021 66

EXT BOOTH MAN’S HOUSE YARD -- NIGHT

Maren jogs back toward the house until she reaches the edge
of the sideyard

Through a window she’s startled to see A woman BOOTH MAN’S
WIFE on a phone checking her watch not happy She’s
bouncing a baby in her arm

Maren stands there frozen until her stomach drops and she
starts running back

EXT IA RURAL ROUTE -- NIGHT
Maren appears back at the car where Lee is waiting

LEE
What --Maren what

But Maren doesn’t answer She digs through the Booth Man’s
glove compartment There’s the bag of weed the man was talk-
ing about She looks through the arm rest then pulls down
the visor That’s where she finds them taped to the back
family photos A wife A toddler son A baby daughter Maren
puts a hand over her face

LEE (CONTD)
Christ --Okay We didn’t know We
didn’t know Hey--

He puts a hand on her shoulder but she pulls away

Lee sees headlights in the distance and curses

The coming car turns into Booth Man’s driveway A WOMAN in a
nightgown (50s) takes the baby from the Booth Man’s wife who
then gets into the car

He pulls Maren out and hurries her into the pickup Then runs

back to the Booth Man’s car He wipes everything down every
spot Maren’s touched

Lee gets in the truck starts it up and puts it in drive He
heads in the opposite direction

INT PICKUP (IA RURAL ROUTE) -- NIGHT

As they put more and more ground behind them Lee looks over
and sees Maren’s worrying flat affect

LEE
I’m gonna drive a while Get some
miles between us and here Bagley
is only about five hours away
(MORE)
Shooting Script 23 July 2021 67

LEE (CONT’D)
If I can Ill drive straight
through Get some sleep if you
want

MAREN
Sleep

LEE
There wasn’t a car seat Maren

MAREN
I know

LEE
He wasn’t wearing a wedding ring--

They make it to the highway and Lee gets on northbound

MAREN
I’ve been trying to think of it as
just death Lee My --condition it
means I have to keep being there
when people-- have death Live peo-
ple and then they’re dead people
But that’s not what it is At all

LEE
We have to eat That’s what it is

MAREN
We murder people Lee Steal their
stuff and move on We ruin lives we
don’t even see Everyone’s got fami-
ly even if they hate each other
even if they lie--

She says this pointedly but if Lee understands she’s talking
about him too he doesn’t show it

LEE
No one will find him until they har-
vest the field That’s months away

MAREN
Oh Lee that’s worse Listen to me

LEE
The way he was behaving sneaking a-
round it coulda happened to him
anytime for any number of reasons

MAREN
It’s not ours to judge
Shooting Script 23 July 2021 68

LEE
It’s not ours to fix either Mar-
en FUCK THIS Why are we even
talking about it like this We
have to do this-- We gotta do it--

MAREN
We should feel --something Weve
killed and it’s murder

At this word Lee begins to shut down pulling out of reach

LEE
My conscience can’t feel any less
than it does And that took years--

MAREN
I’m talking about the future Lee
About being a friend to yourself
If you don’t have that it’s --too
much My god we’ve got whole life-
times ahead of us-- 60 70 years of
this--

LEE
As soon as you factor that in
weve lost okay Why do you want
us to lose

He glares at her

LEE (CONTD)
How dare you make this harder

She is shaking her head over and over

LEE (CONTD)
What do I do Maren-- What do I
say to get you out of this

MAREN
Just drive Just get there Lee

He looks at her as long as he can before looking back to the
road She stares out at the night trying to catch her breath

INT PICK UP (IA RURAL ROUTE) -- LATER

The first dim signs of dawn are rising in the east but the
headlights and dash are still lonely in the darkness Maren’s
asleep hood up turned away from Lee Lee’s driving his
hands tight on the wheel He’s in the middle of a breakdown
Shaking tears--all of which he’s forcing himself to keep
quiet so as not to wake her
Shooting Script 23 July 2021 69

It makes the whole thing more painful more isolating He is
a young man lost caught in circles of trauma

CUT TO
INT PICKUP (MN ROAD) -- DAY

Railroad tracks wake Maren up She looks over at Lee He’s
worn out but doing okay now She squints out at all the sun

LEE
You were dreaming

She gets the road atlas out They pass a sign reading “GRANT
LAKE - RICE LAKE - MISSISSIPPI RIVER HEADWATERS”

LEE (CONT’D)
Were two towns away We just
passed through Wilton--

MAREN
I slept through Minneapolis

He nods The road cuts through woods and lakes now passing
marinas and holiday cabins

TITLE CARD “MN”
INT MN GAS STATION -- DAY

Maren comes out of the toilet and comes in to return the key
A grey-braided CLERK smiles and returns it to its hook

MAREN
Do you have a telephone book The
one outside’s gone --I’m looking

for someone in Bagley

CLERK
This is for the county sweetie

She hands Maren a worn directory Maren looks up “KERNS”
There are six listings but only one is in Bagley

KERNS Barbara 122 Lakeview St Maren copies this on her hand
and passes the phone book back

INT PICKUP -- DAY

Lee drives on Maren is keyed up anxious to get there
Shooting Script 23 July 2021 70

LEE
You don’t want to call first

MAREN
I don’t know whod be picking up
My mom may’ve changed her name It
could be my grandmother A cousin
If whoever it is hung up on me I--
(beat)
Id just rather show up

After a few moments Maren says quietly

MAREN (CONTD)

My mom’s not going to want anything
to do with me either is she She
couldve remarried Had other kids--

LEE
Or she could be an eater like you

MAREN
Have you heard of that Can this be
handed down

He shrugs

MAREN (CONTD)
Then why say it

She rubs her eyes tired in her soul

MAREN (CONT’D)
I’m sorry

LEE
Youve got nothing to be sorry for
Just-- we’ll see when we get there

MAREN
If you ever feel like ditching me
please say so Don’t just leave me
in a parking lot

LEE
I’m not gonna leave you in a park-
ing lot
EXT PICKUP (STREETS OF BAGLEY MN) -- DAY

They drive around Bagley until they find Lakeview St Then
they head up the street until they get to 122 It is a tidy
white house with plants in the yard Lee parks on the road in
front of it
Shooting Script 23 July 2021 71

LEE
I’1l come with you

Maren is about to answer when they see a woman coming out of
the garage with a trash bag Maren gets out and says to Lee

MAREN
No Stay here

EXT MRS KERNS’ HOUSE -- DAY
Maren comes up the driveway and calls out

MAREN
Excuse me Are you Barbara Kerns

The woman BARBARA KERNS (70s) turns She looks at Maren
She sees the color of her skin does the math and turns back
to her front steps wanting nothing to do with this

MAREN (CONT’D)
Mrs Kerns Wait My name is Maren
Yearly I’ve come a very long way

She watches as the woman stops resigned
INT MRS KERNS’ HOUSE LIVING ROOM -- DAY

Barbara Kerns sits in an armchair beside a cold stone fire-
place looking at the birth certificate Maren’s given her

BARBARA KERNS
So they didn’t marry We wondered

Barbara folds the birth certificate and hands it back

BARBARA KERNS (CONT’D)
My husband He died years ago
Throat cancer

MAREN
I’m sorry --And I’m sorry if I sur-
prised you I was afraid to call
In case you didn’t want to see me
(beat)
You didn’t know your daughter had
a child I guess

BARBARA KERNS
No When she wanted to get married
we didn’t agree It drove her away

MAREN
Where did she meet my dad
Shooting Script 23 July 2021 72

BARBARA KERNS
He didn’t say

MAREN
He wouldn’t say anything about her

Barbara’s look suggests she approves of that approach

BARBARA KERNS
College Down in Mankato She fin-
ished her second year before he
talked her into leaving Did he
drive you here --Is he outside

MAREN
No He’s --in Maryland He let me
know where to find you

BARBARA KERNS
So you’ve not run away

MAREN
No My father thinks I’m --old
enough to live on my own

A hint of something like fear crosses Barbara’s expression

BARBARA KERNS
Well if you’re looking for a home
with your mother I’m sorry to tell
you she’s not with us anymore

Maren exhales It’s over She puts her hands to her eyes

MAREN
When --How

BARBARA KERNS
A lot of years now And it’s
nothing I’d like to tell you about
I hope you can respect that

Maren registers the oddness of this A beat

MAREN
I’m her daughter

BARBARA KERNS
It makes sense now why she came
back so --bereaved is the word She
wouldn’t tell us anything either
So much hiding in one family I’m
sorry you’re the child of it all
Shooting Script 23 July 2021 73

She puts her hands on her knees about to stand interview ov-
er But there’s one more thing Maren needs to know

MAREN
What was she like as a girl

BARBARA KERNS
Like

INT MRS KERNS’ HOUSE DINING ROOM -- DAY

Barbara’s taken out photos of Maren’s mother A toddler ina
cloud costume a girl in a choir a teenager washing a car

MAREN
She was your only child

BARBARA KERNS
Not even ours Rob and I couldn’t
have babies of our own Then we
heard about Janelle She’d been
left behind at a Sheriffs station
in Bemidji It was in the paper

Maren is hearing this through a very particular lens

BARBARA KERNS (CONT’D)
We told the county folks we were
interested There was a form to
sign It wasn’t like it is today

MAREN
So you don’t know anything about
her biological parents

BARBARA KERNS
Nothing ‘cept what they did to
their baby She could’ve froze
It’s cold here all the time

MAREN
My mother-- Did she--

Maren stops herself not sure how to put it Barbara stands

BARBARA KERNS
Take the photos if you want them

MAREN
--did she ever hurt anyone

BARBARA KERNS
(startled)
What kind of question is that
Shooting Script 23 July 2021 74

MAREN
I bet she did I’m sure she did I
don’t know what you had to do to
keep it quiet or how much it hurt--

BARBARA KERNS
Stop this at once

MAREN
--look you’re never going to see
me again You may not be her family
by blood but I am I need to know

Barbara is now at the sideboard with her back to Maren visi-
bly shaking Finally she says

BARBARA KERNS
Then ask her yourself

MAREN
What How

Barbara keeps her back to Maren

BARBARA KERNS

I don’t know you You have to under-
stand that I didn’t know what you
wanted coming here But I hope you
mean what you say about never com-
ing back here That sounds cold
but I want to be clear with you

(long beat)
I let you think she was dead but
she’s in a town called Fergus
Falls In a state hospital there

Barbara turns wide-eyed

BARBARA KERNS (CONT’D)
It wasn’t us who put her there if
that’s what you’re thinking She
signed her own papers--

But Maren’s already moving for the door

EXT MRS KERNS’ HOUSEPICKUP -- DAY

Maren pistons her way out of Barbara’s front door and down
the front steps Lee is waiting beside the truck looking wor-
ried Barbara can be seen in the gloom of the house pulling

shut the screen door then shutting the front door

Maren grabs the atlas from the dashboard and spreads it out
on the hood
Shooting Script 23 July 2021 75

She drags a finger south from Bagley over and over until she
finds it Fergus Falls She looks up at Lee

MAREN
Here My mother’s here

INT PICKUP (MN RURAL ROUTE) -- DAY

They pass a sign reading “LEAVING BAGLEY WE’LL MISS YA UP

NORTH” and then they’re out in woods and fields again Lee
looks over at Maren once but Maren is staring ahead as if
willing them on past the horizon all the way to her mother

EXT FERGUS FALLS TREATMENT CENTER PARKING LOT -- DAY

The pickup pulls into the parking lot of the old state hospi-
tal a weathered brick building with many windows most with
metal bars Maren gets out Lee does as well

LEE
Maren--

MAREN
I’1l handle it

She walks up all the stairs to the hospital’s entrance Lee
watches her go

INT FERGUS FALLS TREATMENT CENTER CORRIDORS -- DAY

Maren follows a nurse GAIL (40s) up into the wards She’s a
big friendly woman in scrubs her hair up in a pioneer bun

GAIL
Mrs Kerns’ daughter-- I sure
didn’t expect this when I woke up
this morning

It’s quiet Patients pass by with state-funded haircuts eye-
glasses and pajamas Sitting on a bench in the hall a FE-
MALE PATIENT reads She smiles at Maren as she walks by

MAREN
How long has it been since she’s
had a visitor

GAIL
Your mother’s never had a visitor

Maren is floored
MAREN

What I never knew where she was
If I’d known I would’ve come--
Shooting Script 23 July 2021 76

GAIL
Please don’t regret that We
wouldn’t have allowed a minor in to
see a patient in her condition
She’s in a secure unit

MAREN
Is she dangerous

GAIL
It’s been many years since that was
a concern

MAREN
Why was it ever one

GAIL
Aggression toward the staff Self-
harm But as I said-- long ago
But she asked to remain in that
ward so that’s where she stays

Maren doesn’t know what this could mean Gail unlocks a door
to a more secure wing They go through

GAIL (CONTD)
It’s possible she won’t understand
who you are

MAREN
I just-- I need her to know I’m
finally here

GAIL
She’s already taken her morning
meds so she may nod off anyhow
Well see

They come to the door to Janelle’s room Gail unlocks it and
motions Maren to wait while she goes in first

Through the doorway Maren can see into the sunlit room
GAIL (0S) (CONTD)
There’s someone here to see you
Ms Kerns A surprise A wonderful
surprise
She waves Maren in

INT FERGUS FALLS TREATMENT CENTER JANELLE’S ROOM -- DAY

Maren comes in and finally sees her MOTHER (30s) sitting in a
corner The girl in the photos is gone
Shooting Script 23 July 2021 77

Her mother’s watery eyes are pinned to Maren’s face She
doesn’t smile or speak In her lap Maren sees her mother’s
forearms end in stumps long healed She hides her dismay as
well as she can

MAREN
It’s Maren --I’m Maren

Her mother works her jaw making vague noises of concern

MAREN (CONTD)
Can’t she speak

GAIL
It’s the medication

Janelle stares at her slack jawed but intently

MAREN
I’m not with Dad I’m not with Dad
I just came on my own--

GAIL
Shall I give her your letter I
fetched it on the way up

Janelle half-nods her eyes never leaving Maren Gail takes
out of her pocket a sealed envelope and gives it to Maren

GAIL (CONTD)
She wrote this oh fifteen years
ago now must be I’ve kept it safe
in her file out there in case
--I’1l be right over here

MAREN
She knew I’d come

Gail nods and goes Maren looks at her mother and opens the
envelope There are two pages in her mother’s handwriting

JANELLE (VO)
Hello Little Yearly But you must
not be so little if you’re here
I’d hoped you never read this let-
ter because I hoped you’d never
come --Your father wasn’t supposed
to tell you about me And if a day
came when you showed up here I’d
know it’s because he told you
And I’d know why

The directness of all of this is jarring to Maren She can’t
help but look up at her mom
Shooting Script 23 July 2021 78

Janelle is still and attentive but her face is the face of
chaos tragedy

JANELLE (VO)
I loved you and I loved your fath-
er He didn’t know what I was when
we married but he figured it out
by the time I was pregnant I pro-
mised I’d never hurt either of you
but how could we be sure So I
found this place I wanted to be
near my folks in case they’d visit
My real mother and father I never
knew but I can guess about them
--Maybe you wonder why I didn’t end
my life instead of coming here I
wanted to be here in case you ever
came To be of use to you Listen--

This is so confusing Is her mother glad she’s here Angry

JANELLE (VO)

When a man eats he wants to be out
of control It excites him We’re
not like that We have to take life
and make life How Our bodies want
too much All I ever wanted in this
world was love But I can’t have it
as I am Not a woman Not a mother
Not a wife

Maren moves to the wall She notices on the wall a taped-up
image of the Virgin Mary holding the baby Jesus

JANELLE (VO)
Their faces are gone in here all
the ones I ate up And when I fall
asleep here it’s just --darkness
And I’m grateful The world of love
wants no monsters in it Little
One So let me help you out of it

Maren looks up shocked as her mother plants her feet under
her and springs out of the chair She makes an attempt to get
to Maren’s neck forcing a screaming Maren a-gainst the wall
Maren is just able to keep her back just millimeters from
Janelle’s gnashing teeth

Gail rushes in to restrain Janelle Gail is a big woman but
Janelle is full of adrenaline and fifteen years of waiting
for this moment They struggle

GAIL
Calm down --What’s going on
Shooting Script 23 July 2021 79

Janelle tries to shake off Gail and get to Maren Maren is al-
ready trying to flee the room She’s pulling on the door but
it stays tight

GAIL (CONTD)
Press the button Press it

JANELLE
(slurring)
MAKE HER STAY MAKE HER STAY

MAREN

Maren presses the button and it releases the door She flees
out to the hall and sprints down the corridor

EXT FERGUS FALLS TREATMENT CENTER PARKING LOT -- DAY

Lee is waiting by the truck When he sees Maren at a patient-
proof side door trying to get out he runs over and opens it
She comes out still holding her mother’s letter She gets in
the truck and throws it on the dash

MAREN
Just drive

LEE
You don’t have to say anything
else but tell me if you’re okay

MAREN
You were right Congratulations

He comes carefully to the window but she cranks opens the
door again and gets out

MAREN (CONTD)

Why the fuck did she have me Why
get pregnant if you’re just going
to leave your baby behind

LEE
Maybe it wasn’t planned--

MAREN
She said she loved my dad She said
she wanted to be a mom --She could

have stayed Lee Taught me what I
needed to know You know how differ-
ent this would’ve been if I’d had
one person to talk to One person

on my side

Tears trapped under this anger start fighting their way out
Shooting Script 23 July 2021 80

MAREN (CONT’D)

If she’d stayed I wouldn’t have
done half of what I’ve done She’d
have known from the beginning not
to let me out of her sight Luke
would be a fucking park ranger now
if it wasn’t for her--

LEE
Who

MAREN
Fuck her

LEE

If she’s stayed she might have
hurt you or worse You might not
be here now Believe me I know
what I’m talking about-- This is
better than what I went through--

MAREN
STOP TALKING LEE JUST STOP

Lee reaches out to take her hand but she doesn’t let him

LEE
Youre pissed off you’re scared--
Fair enough If you wanna go at
yourself with all this I can’t
stop you but don’t come at me

MAREN
You slit his throat Lee--

Lee looks at her stunned There is so much going on in this
conversation all he can do is react

LEE
You sat in this truck just the
other night and asked me to do the
same to someone else

MAREN
That was different

LEE

Only because you need it to be
(beat)

You know what I think I think you
got used to being locked in at
night and invisible and now you’re
out in the world and somebodys
seeing you and you like it

But it makes you see yourself too
and that’s fucking you up It’s
fucking me up too okay That’s
how this works

MAREN
How what works

LEE
This Whatever this is

Maren is surprised by this outpouring But he didn’t say the
word “love” and that must mean something

MAREN
You’re wrong

LEE
About which part am I wrong
(beat)
What happened back there Maren
you need to understand there are
worse things

MAREN
My God Lee This isn’t about you-
Your father whatever You’ve had
your chances to tell me about your
father and you won’t

LEE
You know what It’s all about him
for me every fucking minute Just
like every minute from now on for
you is going to be about her back
there They’re us We’re them

MAREN
(angry but sincere)
Then what happened

LEE
It doesn’t matter I love you

Finally he says it but for the wrong reason She exhales

MAREN
Right Well I’m going to decide
no Lee I’m deciding that right
now I’m not going to make her
choices I’m not going to be her

She gets back in the truck and slams the door
Shooting Script 23 July 2021 82

off you’re my fucking hero

She doesn’t answer He gets in the truck and turns it over
INT PICKUP (MN STATE ROUTE 1) -- DAY

Theyve switched places Maren is driving now Lee--who drove
all the previous night--is completely shut off He’s sleeping
or pretending to Maren looks over at him then at the road
then back to Lee She looks unsettled like a bird startled
into the air with no safe place to land Where to now Where
to fly

EXT MN GAS STATION -- DAY

They pull into a gas station on a wooded state route
INT PICKUP (MN GAS STATION) -- DAY
Lee opens his eyes

MAREN
Just getting gas

LEE
Youve got the money

With that he closes his eyes again Maren gets out and once
he’s back to sleep takes the money out of her boot at leaves
it on the dash Then she quietly pulls her rucksack and coat
out of the bed With a last look she walks away runs across
the road across a field there and into dense trees

EXT MN WOODED HILL -- LATER -- DAY

She’s sat down to wait and now watches Lee wake up He goes
inside comes out realizes her backpack is gone and runs to
one end of the lot and then the other calling for her He
checks the gas station’s bathroom Nothing

LEE
MAREN MAREN--

He’s distressed panicked even Finally he gets in the truck
and drives off to start looking along the roadsides

This is the absolute opposite of the rejection and abandon-
ment Sully described when he left his family But Maren wat-
ches all this through the cold calm of self-loathing

Finally she stands
Shooting Script 23 July 2021 83

She reconsiders her birth certificate and photo of her mother
she’s holding They are useless now at best so she drops
them and leaves them there on the ground

CUT TO
INT PICKUP (MN STREETS) -- DAY

Lee is driving the same roads over and again hoping to spot
her As his adrenaline fades and he comes to grips with the
idea she is gone for good a manic desolation sets in As he
drives he’s trying to see everything at once--every front
porch on every house every parked car in every parking lot
any place Maren could be sitting standing hiding

CUT TO
EXT MN RURAL ROUTE -- DAY

Maren comes down a different road She looks dead on her
feet A van passes her She sees ahead a farm stand with bins
of produce from local farm and a few people there The van
pulls into the same lot as the farm stand

EXT MN FARM MART -- DAY

Maren comes up closer to the farm stand but then sees who’s
in the van singing “Beautiful Brown Eyes” He’s found her
He gets out chewing on a toothpick and grinning

SULLY
Youre glad to see ol’ Sully aren’t
ya missy

He comes to where she’s standing and gives her a consuming
hug Maren is alarmed but calm She puts it together fast

SULLY (CONTD)
It worked out I hardly believe it

MAREN
You went through my things In Mary-
land When I was in the shower--

SULLY
And you ran out while I was taking
mine
(kindly)

I sure was curious Saw your birth
papers Saw your mama’s town and
you said you were headed here--
Shooting Script 23 July 2021 84

MAREN
You’ve been following me since

SULLY

It felt crazy to me too But I
didn’t know what else to do

MAREN
Did you --talk to my grandmother

SULLY
No I found the address and waited
for you to come along And you did
Day after I parked on her street--

MAREN

rupt You were with a friend --And

SULLY
Life with Sully’s never dully

She glances at the people at the farm market A FARMER (50s)
running it is looking over at them but looks away

MAREN
It’s weird you followed me here

SULLY

It’s only been a week Life’ll get
weirder I promise

(beat)
I liked our talk I don’t see
people much I know what I told you
when we met but it’s a hard and
lonely road for us There ain’t no
sense making it any lonelier if you
don’t have to

MAREN
I’m a girl

SULLY
My daughter’s age if I had one

MAREN
Is that what this is

SULLY
(getting frustrated)
How do you like that

MAREN
I’m not trying to upset you Sully
You drove a long way I’m just not
comfortable with this

SULLY
Is it because I have a van Vans
are creepy I get it I’ll geta
better car

She watches him How this kind of life must warp people over
time She shudders

MAREN
It’s not about the van

SULLY
Youve never fit with someone

MAREN

SULLY
You don’t like me

MAREN
I don’t trust you And it doesn’t
matter if I’m right or if I’m wrong
about that it only matters I feel
it

SULLY
So you’re not gettin’ in

MAREN
Not gettin’ in

Sully gets a petulant look on his face and regards her

SULLY
Fuck you then Fuck you Missy

MAREN
Sully--

He takes a step forward then a step back furious

SULLY
You dumb cunt
I dried off next to you I never
done that before With anybody
That means something I dried off
next to you--

Maren stares at him trying to understand his fury She looks
over at the farm stand where the Farmer is definitely follow-
ing this now along with one of his customers

She’s about to say more when Sully get into his van He
starts it up backs out and squeals away Maren watches the
van disappear thrumming with fear now

INT MARSHALL MN CAFE -- DAY

The cafe is all but empty Out the front window we see the
road coming into town In a moment Maren appears When she
gets close enough she takes a big rock she’s been carrying
out of her pocket and tosses it to the roadside

Outside the cafe she stands at an intersection looking at a
building across the street She hesitates starts toward it
then hesitates again Then she comes into the cafe instead
Two cops are there she looks at them on her way to a seat by
the window One of them looks back gives her a polite nod

She looks exhausted She’ll never be a regular girl She’1ll
always want what she shouldn’t A waitress comes and puts
down a cup of coffee and goes Maren just stares out the win-
dow The building across the street is a police station

Under the table she takes out her father’s cassette tape and
considers her options She rewinds it as if to play it from
the beginning for someone She circles the inner spool with
her finger

INT MARSHALL MN POLICE STATION -- DAY

She comes in and walks up to the little sliding window A PO-
LICE RECEPTIONIST (40s) sits behind it

POLICE RECEPTIONIST
Can I help you

MAREN
I need to talk to a detective

POLICE RECEPTIONIST
Well we don’t have a detective
but there’s a sheriff if you don’t
want to talk to a regular officer

MAREN
The sheriff then please

POLICE RECEPTIONIST
He’s on a call if you can wait

Maren nods and turns to sit down but then turns back

MAREN
Do you have a tape player here

But Maren looks into the office behind the receptionist and
sees on top of a filing cabinet a boom box
Shooting Script 23 July 2021 88

MAREN (CONTD)
Never mind

Maren goes and sits She’s alone in a strange town ready to

turn herself in She’s facing a wall of framed photos of ev-

ery officer at the station Smiling men in uniform Theres a
gap where a photo was removed someone fired or dead That’s
where her focus goes

She sits looking at the space left by some missing young man
Doesn’t her heart deserve a chance She thinks about what she
is about to do then thinks again Then she stands and quick-
ly leaves

INT PICKUP (MN BUS STATION) -- NIGHT

Lee is parked outside the bus station in Detroit Lakes He
watches people go in and out the front entrance including a
few men his age one with kids already He settles in for the
night exhausted knowing Maren’s not likely to appear here
but unwilling yet to close his eyes Finally he has to

INT PICKUP (MN BUS STATION) -- PRE-DAWN

moments to orient himself and remember where he is and why
Once the terror is gone the anger remains

EXT MO BOWLING ALLEY -- DAY

Through the side windows of a bowling alley the snack coun-

ing a beer He’s flirting with them but they’re not finding
it funny They get their purses and move So he gets up
gathers his cigarettes and heads outside He’s drunk on his
feet The parking lot has few cars in it We finally see this
is Brad from the campground The “Groupie” Jake is nowhere
to be seen Brad comes out into the parking lot

Lee is sitting on the hood of his car Brad sees him
LEE

Where’s Jake Brad --Did you eat
Jake
Shooting Script 23 July 2021 89

BRAD
Look who it is Loverboy

Before Brad can say more Lee drops down and swings the tire
iron he’s got in his hand It hits Brad in the mouth and he
goes down Lee swings several more times Brad rolls on his
side to try to evade the hits MEWLING through his shattered
teeth Lee takes one last swing and the parking lot is silent
again except for the faint sound of BALLS HITTING PINS in-
side Lee looks down at Brad then leans over and pulls him
onto his back so that he starts choking on his own blood

Lee doesn’t drag him into the woods or get the body into a
car to drive away with it to eat He just leaves Brad bleed-
ing out on the cement

EXT CAR (KY ICE CREAM STAND) -- DAY

A group of teenage girls crowds the front of a walk-up ice
cream stand They hang together with their dipped cones and
shakes Kayla’s there her yellow-tipped hair in a ponytail
Maren watches them from where she sits on the hood of a car
parked in front Once the last of them has her ice cream and
the group passes her Maren calls out

MAREN
Hey Kayla--
Shooting Script 23 July 2021 91

Kayla turns and peers at her

MAREN (CONTD)
It’s Maren Lee’s friend-- I saw
you at your aunt’s house a couple
months back--

KAYLA
I remember

Kayla tells her friends to go on They walk away but with
lingering curious looks back at Maren

MAREN
I wanted to say hi that day but--
Look is Lee here

KAYLA
He was at my aunt’s place for a
while but my mom wouldn’t let him
alone so he took his tent and
moved out to the lake

MAREN
Lake

KAYLA
“Land Between the Lakes” A state
park down 641--

Maren can barely hide her excitement at this her relief

KAYLA (CONT’D)

He comes into town when he wants
to He’s just --going through some-
thing I guess I asked him about
you and he just said you “went
another way”

(vaguely)
I wondered why he’s been staying I
guess he was hoping you’d show up

Maren sees how disappointed this makes Kayla

MAREN
Well I don’t know about that He
may not even want to see me I know
he wanted to get back to see you
though--

KAYLA
He said that

Maren nods Kayla tears up and is immediately embarrassed
Shooting Script 23 July 2021 92

KAYLA (CONT’D)

God he’s an asshole Why is he
like this I tell him no one even
remembers all that stuff with the
cops anymore That was four years
ago And he’s been out of town for
three and half of them It’s not
fair

MAREN
Is this something about your dad

KAYLA

He didn’t tell you

(beat)
Our dad’s a drunk So-drunk-he’d-
piss-on-the-wall kinda guy He got
in Lee’s face a couple of times
when Lee would try to calm him
down and the day he left he wound
up hitting Lee When I tried to
break them up he hit me too Lee
lost it told me to call the cops
When our dad ripped the phone out
of the wall Lee got him in a head-
lock and told me to ride his bike
into town It’s four miles

Maren looks truly sad to hear this and whatever is next

KAYLA (CONT’D)
When I got back with the cops Lee
was pretty beat up and Dad’s car
was gone Lee told ‘em he took off
but there was blood on Lee so they
put him in the holding cell to test
it For a minute everyone was like
Lee killed him Lee killed him but
it was all Lee’s blood all bull-
shit so they let him go --Now he
wont ever live here again

Maren reaches out and takes her hand What’s remarkable is
that Kayla lets her saying softly

KAYLA (CONTD)
A Lee is a Lee is a Lee

MAREN
(smiling gently)
I know that poem
Shooting Script 23 July 2021 93

KAYLA
I just want him to be happy
--Maybe that’s too much

It’s a heartbreaking thing to say Kayla stands up so she
won’t cry more Maren walks a few steps over to her car

MAREN
Hey-- I meant to ask Did you pass
your drivers test

KAYLA
Yeah In my friend’s pickup Thank
god Lee taught me in one or I never
woulda got the parking down

MAREN
I got this car for almost nothing
Id like you to have it
(off Kayla’s look)
I don’t need it anymore You can
just take it off my hands

She gets her pack out of the back and hands Kayla the keys

KAYLA
Are you sure Holy Crap Thank you
(thinking)
How are you going to get out to see
Lee Want me to drive you

MAREN
Don’t worry I’ll manage

As Maren walks away she sees Kayla looking at the car she is
already thinking of as hers and smiles

EXT KY CAMPGROUND -- DAY

Lee is coming back from the pump with two full jugs of water
He nods at people as he passes them but it’s hard to be a-
round so many families He’s nearly back to his campsite when
he hears someone calling his name

He looks and there is Maren on the camp road peering into
each campsite When she sees him she stops then and runs ov-

er They don’t quite know what to do with their bodies until
Lee pulls her into a hug

MAREN
I’m sorry Lee

LEE
Quit that right now Are you okay
Shooting Script 23 July 2021 94

MAREN
Yeah I’m fine I’m good --You

LEE
Better yeah A whole lot better

She sees his tidy tent and camp

MAREN
This your set up

LEE
You like it It’s a good tent

MAREN
We should really use it then

A beat Then he pulls the “we” into his side of the conversa-
tion as easily as she hoped he would

LEE
Where we going

MAREN
How about not north again

LEE
Yeah north is bullshit

MAREN
Total bullshit --Fuck north

MAREN (CONT’D)
Yeah Eat me north

And they laugh and all is right again

LEE
So not north and not here Good

EXT KY LAKE -- NIGHT

Lee and Maren swim in the lake with fifty other campers all
under the fireworks lighting up the sky directly over their
heads It’s like some kind of aquatic rave

Lee discreetly points out a drunk man who is stumbling back
up the little beach toward the campground He nods to her and
then swims casually after him following him to shore

EXT KY CAMPGROUND -- NIGHT

Maren walks to their camp in a towel
Shooting Script 23 July 2021 95

She looks for Lee and sees He’s at the edge of the woods
300 yards away waving her over predator to predator The
colored light from the fireworks stains Lee

She goes to join him

Theyve stopped for gas While Lee fuels up he checks the

chatting with a man who is an OGLALA SIOUX (50s)

LEE
The knocking happens every time
now

OGLALA SIOUX GUY
It’s the rod bearings then

LEE
Shit That means a new engine I’d
rather sell it for parts --Wanna
make an offer Ill sell it to you
right now

OGLALA SIOUX GUY
You don’t want to sell it out here
Look around man How you gonna get
home

They laugh Maren watches He catches her looking and the
glance that passes between the two of them opens the way to
what’s next

They’ve found each other again crossed the country for each
other This look is the first completely adult unambiguous
exchange of love we’ve seen between them

He is hers and she is his
Shooting Script 23 July 2021 96

EXT OGLALA NATIONAL GRASSLANDS -- SUNSETDUSK

They’ve camped on a low ridge that gives them an epic view of
the sunset on the sea of grass The buttes in the distance
are their only company The tent flaps are open and they stir
in the breeze

Lee lays on his sleeping bag watching the sun on the hori-
zon Maren is next to him reading Marilynne Robinson’s House-
keeping He watches her next Finally she looks up

LEE
It really is like you go someplace
else--

MAREN

Watching me read Well you should
know after this I’m out of books
We’1ll have to find a bookstore

LEE
It might have to wait ‘til Omaha on
our way back

(beat)

By the way that guy told me we
should keep two days of water with
us in case that engine goes In
case we have to wait a while for a
ride As soon as we can we’ll get
another set of wheels

MAREN
I wish we could save it

LEE
Id rather have a van anyway

MAREN
I learned to drive in that truck

LEE
You learned to kiss in that truck

MAREN
I knew how to kiss before you Mr
Kentucky

LEE
I sang to my girl in that truck

They share a long look When he looks away Maren decides
She says gently
Shooting Script 23 July 2021 97

MAREN
Kayla told me about what happened
with your dad --I just I wanted

you to know I knew
Lee peers out at the dusk and says nothing for a long moment

LEE
Kayla doesn’t know what happened

MAREN
What she pieced together then
He sounds like he was as asshole--

LEE
I don’t want to talk about my fa-
ther I don’t just sweat this stuff
out like you do

He looks at her then away But Maren won’t back down

MAREN
Kayla said he hit you both the day
he left
LEE
Yeah I told her to get the cops
(beat)

And then he left
A beat She moves a bit closer to him

MAREN
I guess I don’t believe that There
must’ve been a lot of blood on you
for the cops to bring you in--

LEE

As soon as she was gone he went
for me okay To rip me open With
his teeth

(beat)
I know I smelled that first on him
He knew what I was before I did
And he didn’t help me either

So they’re both the children of eaters The implications are
deep

MAREN
What happened

Lee really doesn’t want to say more but the woman he loves
is asking So he pulls out every word like rotten teeth
Shooting Script 23 July 2021 98

LEE
I got him in a sleeper hold until
he passed out Then I hit him with
an ashtray to make sure he stayed
out I dragged him out to his car
and drove him to a place I knew a-
bout half a mile from there a barn
that belonged to a guy who used to
sell me and my buddies weed He was
in California so I knew no one was
gonna be in there for a while

Maren puts her hand on his leg just to touch him

LEE (CONTD)
I put the car in the barn and duct
taped the shit out of him I left
his nostrils open but everything
else I taped up tight

He’s living this all over again as he says the words He
presses his fingers against his eyes

MAREN
How long was he in that barn

LEE
Three days Yeah Three days The
way he was breathing when he heard
me come back in was-- He knew what
was going to happen

Maren tears up hearing this They are in many ways the same
kind of orphan

MAREN
What did you do

LEE
I ate him right the fuck up
(beat)
I took off his shoes his socks
Then I took the tape off his eyes
so he could watch me And then I
ate his feet

He’s scared the wiring that tells a boy not to kill his
father is short-circuiting all over again against the voltage
of an older boy’s rage his need to kill the father

LEE (CONTD)
I stripped the muscle off his legs
He passed out came to passed out
again He vomited at some point
(MORE)
Shooting Script 23 July 2021 99

LEE (CONTD)
I could smell it Maybe he choked
on it Or died from the blood he
lost It was great I was high with
it I put what was left of him in
the trunk and drove all the way
past Memphis I sunk his car at the
bottom of a quarry down there But
I fucked up Kayla’s life Fucked up
my mom’s life I couldn’t deal I
didn’t sleep for two weeks I think
I woulda killed myself if it wasn’t
for Kayla I would’ve done it-- I
think I should’ve done it--

She reaches out to him and pulls him to her He won’t look at
her They are holding one another but can’t see each other

MAREN
Lee-- I would have done the same
thing In my own way but I would
have done it

He says in a quiet voice a boy’s voice

LEE
You don’t mean that--

MAREN
You protected the people you love

She can see a spasm of doubt even under all his armor

LEE
I can’t hear this right now Okay

MAREN
Hold my hands and look at me

He shakes his head But reluctantly he does When he sees
she is smiling at him with love He cries again

LEE
You don’t think I’m a bad person

MAREN

(simply)
All I think is that I love you

After a moment he pulls her close Now the weeping really be-
gins It floods out of him in a way his body can barely keep
up with She holds him close and rides out the sobs with him

MAREN (VO)
Where do we go now
Shooting Script 23 July 2021 100

LEE (VO)
We can go anywhere Anywhere

MAREN (VO)
Let’s drive back until the truck
gives out someplace and then we’1ll

Like people do

ing things into a tighter configuration

HARMONY
This is my last year I’ve been
going to Tiffin but I wanted to do
my last year at UM so I can say I
graduated from there --Hand me
that big bag from the backseat--

Lee goes and comes back with a new mesh laundry bag full of
bedding Harmony takes it and starts shoving it into place

MAREN
Smart Do you have friends there

Maren glances at Lee wondering why he’s not taking the lead
in this conversation But he seems happy to let Maren do the
talking to be the front-facing part of the team now

HARMONY

Give me that plastic toolbox and
there’s a trash bag of clothes--

I don’t really know anyone yet but
it’ll be worth it It wasn’t as

But then he looks candidly at Harmony
Shooting Script 23 July 2021 104

LEE (CONTD)
Unless you want to do anything else

Harmony is suddenly being presented with an opportunity she
didn’t know she was going to have She looks at Lee He looks
handsome and free like a Rust Belt poet She can hear a few
students outside LAUGHING She doesn’t register any danger

HARMONY
Well-- I’m not sure any of this fur-

Maren doesn’t go straight to the movies She walks through
town seeing a life she might be having were it not for the
strangeness in her So many kids Some are frat and sorority

“hi” to her as they pass On some level she wants this so
badly for herself

I did not--I had to get it done I
wish you’d come back a lot sooner

She had some cleaning stuff but I

MAREN
Lee You’re gonna love it I an-
swered a question--

There’s no response from the bathroom But the smell is stong-
er here And all the blinds have all been pulled down

Then she sees by the bed a satchel She remembers where
she’s seen it a second too late Someone rushes her from the
corner closet and a hand is clamped over her mouth Sully

He drags her over to the bed a 6” buck knife in one hand

SULLY
I’m gonna take my hand away and
you’re not gonna scream ‘cause Sul-
ly’s a friend and we don’t scream
at friends

She nods He takes his hand away She’s terrified but angry
too

SULLY (CONT’D)
Now where’s your cutie pie I saw
him walk out half an hour ago

MAREN
I don’t know

SULLY
I don’t think that fella’d like me
much Depending on what you told
him

MAREN
I barely told him anything

SULLY
That kinda hurts Sully’s feelings

MAREN
Howd you find us

SULLY
Doesn’t matter Missy

MAREN
I’m asking A friend is asking and
you don’t ignore a friend --And I
wish you wouldn’t call me Missy

SULLY
It’s short for Maren
Shooting Script 23 July 2021 108

MAREN
No It isn’t

SULLY
Ever since I drove away from you up
in Minnesota nothing’s felt right

MAREN
What does that mean

He looks away from her as if he can’t quite bear to have her
eyes on him as he says

SULLY
It means-- It means unfinished bus-—
iness

MAREN
That guy Lee-- We’re together now
Sully

Sully can’t keep the rage out of his voice when he says

SULLY
That’s not the business I’m talking
about

But he calms himself and lays his head on Maren’s chest

SULLY (CONT’D)
I don’t mind if you don’t like Sul-
ly What I mind is how much you
know about him What he’s done Who
he’s done it to I don’t know why I
told you all that stuff I never
told anybody before you

MAREN
You think I’d tell anyone Whod ev-
er believe me --And I thought you
didn’t kill people Sully You told
me that You don’t kill--

SULLY
I used to tell people the truth
you know They never took me seri-
ous I got so tired I wanted to be
with someone who understood

MAREN
You can’t do something just because
youre lonely
Shooting Script 23 July 2021 109

On the ceiling Maren can see a growing wedge of sunlight
She can’t see the door with Sully blocking her but someone
is coming in She forces her eyes to stay on Sully

SULLY
I saw you outside that police sta-
tion You were thinking of saying
something to somebody--

MAREN
I was going to turn myself in I
was sick of myself

SULLY
You mighta told them about me too

It’s Lee coming in He’s out of breath and has a plastic
shopping bag in both hands six feet behind Sully Lee’s head
is rising into Maren’s view but she doesn’t look up She
squirms so there’s a bit of noise and Sully has to keep his
focus on her

MAREN
You never get sick of yourself

SULLY
Sully just wants to sleep at night
Sleep it off

MAREN
I said stop calling yourself Sully

He’s about to reply but he stops and takes in the air A
look crosses his face As Sully begins to turn Lee slams the
bag down over his head and yanks it around his throat Maren
sees what’s about to happen and yells

MAREN (CONTD)
He’s got a knife--

Before she can grab back his arm Sully is able to jab at

Lee The knife hits Lee at an awkward angle right in the hol-
low of his shoulder right under his collarbone Lee BARKS in
pain Sully tries to stab at Lee again at his face but now
Maren grabs his hand with both of hers

Lee yanks Sully backward to get him off his balance and Sully
falls pulling Maren with him The knife nicks Maren in the
chin Sully’s face is contorting behind the thick yellow plas-
tic already wet with condensation He yanks Maren around
trying to keep hold of his knife but she bites savagely into
his wrist and he lets go As soon as he does she grabs it

off the floor and sticks it into his belly Then again

Shooting Script 23 July 2021 110

Sully yells Lee has him in a hold now one arm up over his
head Sully tries to rip the bag open so he can breathe

LEE
Don’t stop Maren--

Sully has to leave the bag to try to fend off Maren’s knife
trying to see her through the plastic Blood hits her in one
eye Then she sinks it between his ribs then again on the
other side Sully’s yells turn to gasps as his lungs deflate
He kicks at Maren and she stumbles backward putting the
bloody point of the knife into the laminate floor

LEE (CONTD)
The bathtub-- Help me--

Lee starts dragging Sully toward the bathroom Sully is weak-
ening Maren gets a grip on his kicking legs and together
they half-drag half-carry him into the bathroom

INT HARMONY’S APARTMENT BATHROOM -- DAY

Lee gets into the tub and pulls Sully over the lip of it and
on top of himself keeping Sully in a tight hold Sully tries
to get free but he’s so weak it’s easy for Maren to push him
down and climb on top of him Lee bites hard into the back of
Sully’s neck Sully gags on the pain eyes wide on Maren
through the bag She pulls open Sully’s shirt revealing his
leaking wounds She jams two fingers into one of them and
yanks it open further Sully claws one last time at the bag
and this time rips the plastic His face pushes through the
membrane like a man being born He gulps the air and weakly
bats back at Lee who switches from eating his neck to latch-
ing onto his hand Maren pulls the gut wound open enough to
begin pulling out fat Finally Sully dies Lee lifts Sully’s
arm free of his shirt and drapes it around his own neck so he
can rest a moment and try to catch his breath They’re not
his children but Sully was somehow their future one terri-
ble version of it

Maren looks up and sees their two faces side by side She
sees Lee is crying and knows why He is killing his father
all over again Like he once said he will always be killing
his father And what does that mean for her She climbs out
of the tub and flees the room

INT HARMONYS APARTMENT -- DAY

Maren stagger down the hall back into the bedroom Lee a few
paces behind her

LEE
That was that man you met The one
who followed you

LEE (CONTD)

(beat)
I smelled him two blocks from here
I ran all the way All the way

Maren sees Sully’s satchel beside the bed and goes to it She
looks through its contents Wallets Mr Goodbars Western pa-
perbacks and of course the rope of hair

She unwinds it from its coil afraid of what she knows is

there Near the bottom at the end bright yellow-tipped hair

is braided into the rope Kayla That’s how he found them

Lee leans against the wall and then slides down it leaving a
trail of blood on the plaster

LEE (CONTD)
He was so much bigger Heavier
But man was he quick on his feet
More than this guy even--

MAREN
Who was

She can’t stop looking at Kayla’s hair at the tragedy she’s
holding in her hands But Lee is coughing and wheezing now
She looks over and sees he is seriously hurt

She goes over to him dragging the braid with her She looks
closely at his injury
MAREN (CONT’D)

Oh Christ Lee He hit your lung
We’ve got to get you to an ER--

LEE
I let my guard down Am I doing it
good --Am I bad

MAREN
No Lee-- You’re good all right
You’re really good

LEE
Am I really bad Tell me

She listens to his wound There are bubbles in the blood

MAREN
Airs coming out I can see it

He stares at the end of the rope It’s Kayla’s hair There’s
no denying it
Shooting Script 23 July 2021 112

LEE
He got Kayla

MAREN
Don’t think about that now We
can’t take care of this ourselves--—
We have to go

LEE
No Maren-- Maren Eat

The smell of open meat in the apartment is pulling her hunger
toward it strongly but she’s repulsed and says instead

MAREN
I don’t want it-- --Not him

He puts an arm around her and she puts her head on his chest

MAREN (CONT’D)
Does this hurt

LEE
Nothing you do could hurt me

He’s calming himself but what he calms into is worse He kis-
ses her on top of her head and says his voice tired

LEE (CONTD)
Don’t feel bad okay Don’t feel
anything I want you to do it This
was always going to be it Love me

Maren tries to pull away but he pins her there

LEE (CONT’D)
Eat

Then she realizes what he means He means her to eat him

MAREN
No Lee no-- I won’t--

Maren tries to pull away but he won’t let her

MAREN (CONT’D)
Lee for God’s sake let me up--

LEE
I want you to eat me I want you to
feed Bones and all I’11l just--
go ok Up to space Come find me
later-- Ok
Shooting Script 23 July 2021 113

Maren starts to be able to hear Lee’s heartbeat under his
breastbone It is hard to know the moment her own affect
begins to shift but Lee holds her to his chest until fin-
ally inevitably she bites into it

CLOSE ON Heavy pain contorts Lee’s face but he doesn’t
yell He doesn’t scream She must be burrowing into his flesh
now He’s letting her do it The blood loss makes him faint
confused At some point he must be hallucinating The last
thing he says though the agony is unintelligible

She makes anguished animal noises as she eats Not animal

because they’re too savage to be human animal because they
are emotional and vulnerable as animals are At what point
Lee dies she’ll never know she can’t see his face We can

FADE TO BLACK
INT HARMONY’S APARTMENT -- DAY

Maren is gone The apartment is silent once again for rent
The remains of Lee are gone The remains of Sully are gone as
well The place has been cleaned well

There is a stain on the floor beside the bed but it’s hard
to tell what left it or how long ago There is the space
under the bed The camera pushes into that space which be-
gins to widen out and become

EXT NE GRASSLANDS -- DAWN

The sky is becoming light but is still lost in deep hues of
transition the world rotating toward but not yet in view
of the sun We see their tent Barry’s truck then two fig-
ures sitting naked at the edge of the ridge the edge of the
world Maren and Lee

Is this a memory A fantasy Are in Maren’s head Lee’s None
of that is something we can know All we have is what we see
and what we see is youth freedom beauty and most of all
love The country belongs to them here not the reverse
There is no abandonment no shame and no harm Not anymore

They are welcome here They can stay
