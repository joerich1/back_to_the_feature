WHAT LIES BENEATH

by

Clark Gregg

June 14 1999

FADE IN

Moving through a murky haze Dark blues and greens shafts
of prismed purple A pale shard appears in the distance
Gliding closer a group of tiny fish dart before the camera
Were UNDERWATER Arriving at the form it finally sharpens
into focus Its a WOMANS BODY submerged in dark water
arms floating lazily at her side The face is obscured by
flowing hair All that is visible is a pair of COLD STARING
GREEN EYES which blink closed

MORPH TO

then open as BLUE EYES as a DIFFERENT FACE emerges from
water CLAIRE SPENCER awakens from this unsettling dream in
her bathtub She pivots the large BRASS SHOWER HEAD (the
kind that moves up and down on a pipe) off to one side
reaches toward her feet and we hear the sound of a plug being
pulled

INT BATHROOM - DAY
A HAZY SHAPE-- accompanied by a whirring sound

A steam covered mirror is cleared with a BLOW DRYER Claire
starts to come into focus The dryer stops She presses the
red GFI button on the socket ZAP A big blue spark
shoots out Claire pulls her hand backand the dryer
starts whirring again

She clears the mirror and replaces the dryer on a hook She
regards herself in the mirror and attractive elegant-
looking woman around forty

Claire traces a finger along a small but noticeable SCAR
above her left eye then slowly drops the hand to her cheek
as if confirming her existence

INT CLAIRES HOUSE - DAY

Claire now dressed presses her face against a door
listening for the sounds of stirring from within Silence
She quietly pushes open the door

INT ROOM - DAY

Claire makes her way past half-filled boxes and duffels to a
window then pulls the curtains to reveal

A LOVELY WOODED LAKE It couldnt be more picturesque A
24 SAILBOAT is moored at the dock and an OLD STONE
LIGHTHOUSE sits on a point across the lake

The sunlight motivates an unconscious groan from A FIGURE
still shrouded by covers

Claire sits beside the sleeping form She scans the room
briefly taking in a Greenpeace flag and a picture of a
tomboyish ten year-old girl at camp

She gently pulls back the covers and peers down at the same
face now a waifish pretty seventeen year-old with chopped
hair and tiny nose ring Claire leans over and inhales the
sleeping scent of her only daughter CAITLIN She places her
hand on a cheek The girls eyelids flutter softly

CLAIRE
Morning beauty

Caitlin lets out a grunt and rolls over onto her belly

CLAIRE
Lets go Or well never leave on time

From out of the pillow comes Caitlins voice

CAITLIN
(muffled)
Im totally ready

Claire glances around at the piles of unpacked clothes

CLAIRE
Come on Ill make you some waffles
maybe well squeeze in a trip to the
mall

Caitlin

Claire gently swats at the tiny lump that is Caitlins
behind

CAITLIN

Claire stands and instinctively s
the floor then folds and neatly
Caitlin turns her head sideways o

She continues to gaze downward The man leans over the hood
murmuring darkly at his wife though for Claire and Norman
the scene is entirely silent

CLAIRE

NORMAN

Theyre all psychotic

Outside Mr Feur turns and walks toward his house Norman
begins once again to nuzzle Claire Her eyes close but
then she gently demurs

CLAIRE
Shes awake

NORMAN
Well be quiet Quick and quiet

She turns to him

CLAIRE
I dont want to be either

He smiles A really good smile The lips and tongue on his
faded T-shirt mark him as a Stones fan

NORMAN
Whens she out of here

CLAIRE

Norman gives up He busses her cheek

CLAIRE
(wistfully)
Yep

They share a warm poignant look He turns and moves down
the stairs

NORMAN
(calling over his shoulder)
Were going to have to leave by three if

Claire returns her gaze to the scene below as Mr Feur says
something ominous to his wife then stalks into the house

NORMAN (0S)
Claire

CLAIRE
(absently)
Three oclock

ANGLE

Mrs Feur drops her face into her hands

EXT SIDEWALK CAFE - DAY

Claire peruses her to do list as Caitlin munches a panini
CLAIRE

some mittens
Caitlin puts down the sandwich and regards her mother warmly

The bond between them is palpable

CLAIRE
Do you have a scarf

CAITLIN

Claire looks up from her little pad of paper

CLAIRE
Yes

CAITLIN
Its only two hours away

CLAIRE
I know that

CAITLIN

CAITLIN

Claire smiles
CLAIRE

Sweetheart Ive known this day was

Caitlin smiles back and nods her face betraying some
concern Claire takes her hand

CLAIRE

She nods reassuringly and pulls Caitlin into an embrace

eyes close

CAITLIN (VO)
Mother

EXT COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY - DAY

Her
Claires frozen in the hug

CAITLIN
(beat)
Mom

Her eyes open Widen to reveal Claire holding Caitlin on
the college campus The URBAN SKYLINE looms in the
background

CAITLIN
I haveta go

After a moments hesitation she releases her grip Caitlin
glances over her shoulder to make sure no ones witnessed

this overt display of maternal affection

CAITLIN
Ill call you

Claire produces an ENVELOPE which she presses into her
daughters hand Its a book of TRAIN TICKETS

CLAIRE
Come home anytime

Caitlin looks at Norman

NORMAN
Really gonna leave me huh

She nods They share a tender look

NORMAN
Be good

She throws her arm briefly tightly around his waist A bit
overwhelmed he slowly brings his hand to the back of
Caitlins head After a moment she steps back

CAITLIN
Bye

then turns and makes her way toward the large old
Columbia dorm A banner is draped across its portals which
reads

WELCOME CLASS OF 04

Claire watches her daughter melt into a crowd of similarly
shaggy freshmen smoking and talking on the front steps Her
eyes are shining Norman wraps an arm around her waist as
she daps at a tear with a Kleenex

CLAIRE
(smiling)
I almost made it

They turn and head for the car Claire sneaks one last look
over her shoulder

ANGLE

Caitlin glancing back at Claire with an apprehensive smile
INT NORMAN AND CLAIRES ROOM - NIGHT

Claire walks in from the bathroom wearing a sexy cotton
nightgown Norman is in bed absorbed in some notes

She gets into bed then picks up a thick text from beside him
and starts reading After a moment

NORMAN
Whatcha reading

CLAIRE
(reading the cover sexy voice)
Genetic repair mechanisms in eukaryotic
organisms

NORMAN
(slight smile)
How is it

Claire snuggles up

CLAIRE
Excellent Couple of Swedish sailor cells

cell

NORMAN
(lost in his book)
Nice

She pulls slightly away

CLAIRE

He places his book on the bedside table and turns to her

NORMAN

CLAIRE
Fine

NORMAN

CLAIRE
I am really

NORMAN
Its just shes been the focus for a
while

CLAIRE

NORMAN

Claire thinks for a moment

CLAIRE

CLAIRE

To get my life back To have some time
for myself Some time for us

He caresses her

NORMAN
You did a great job Shes a good kid

CLAIRE

Theres a weighty pause
NORMAN
Its just us now

CLAIRE
I know
He kisses her
NORMAN
Tired
CLAIRE
Nope
NORMAN

Wanna fool around

CLAIRE
Yup

They start to kiss Its slow and a bit methodical in the
manner of long time lovers Suddenly the SOUND OF A WOMAN
WAILING can be heard They stop

NORMAN
Did you

CLAIRE
Shhh

They listen The sounds start to become louder It is
clearly two people in the throes of some very vocal and
savage love making

NORMAN
Jesus

He walks over and closes the window It doesnt help

NORMAN
I guess theyre making up

The womans moaning becomes embarrassingly loud

CLAIRE
What is he doing to her

They lie together in silence as the cacophony drones on

NORMAN
And we moved out here for the quiet
CLAIRE
Mmm

Beat The mood has passed

NORMAN
Maybe we should just

CLAIRE

She smiles

CLAIRE
Night

They lie together in the darkness as the Feurs finally
climax

INT CAITLINS ROOM - DAY

Claire pushes open the door to Caitlins room carrying an
armful of FOLDED LAUNDRY She moves quickly to the bureau
not wanting to spend much time in here then grabs a TINY
BLACK TOP from the pile and drops it into a drawer Shes
just about to close it when something catches her eye

CLAIRES POV

She drops the laundry and slowly pulls a tattered old
JUILLIARD T-SHIRT with a very seventies logo from the drawer
Claire gazes around the room which is a reliquary of
Caitlins recently concluded childhood PICTURES TROPHIES
STUFFED ANIMALS

She brings the now faded T-shirt to her face and drinks in
the smells She stares down at the word Juilliard
MATCH CUT TO
INT BASEMENT - DAY

JUILLIARDnow its on the same T-shirt only Claires

wearing it and shes much younger Its an old photograph in
an album Younger Norman stands next to her in the shot his
arm draped around her waist A CELLO CASE stands beside her

Claire glances around at several hastily unpacked boxes and
sees propped in the cornerTHE CELLO CASE She gazes at
other photos

-- Claire in her wedding dress Norman beside her in a tux
with a very wide bow-tie

-- Claire and Norman in front of a UNIVERSITY BUILDING A
tiny Caitlin rests on her hip

Claires chin begins to tremble and she chokes out a sob
EXT FRONT YARD - DAY

Her face streaked with tears Claire stumbles out into the
immaculately manicured ROSE GARDEN

The yard is surrounded by a HIGH WOODEN FENCE She collapses
into a lawn chair as the tears begin to subside Suddenly
she hears something coming from next door

She cocks her head and attempts to make out the sound It
is ironically the sound of a WOMAN CRYING Claire makes
her way over to the fence The womens sobbing becomes more
plaintive and fevered

She places her face against the prickly vine covered fence
and tries to peer through the crack All she can make out is
A DARK BLUE BLUR that seems to be rocking Claire gathers
her nerve and calls out

CLAIRE
Hello

Theres no reaction

CLAIRE
Mrs Feur

The sobbing chokes down to a breathless whimpering The blue
shape vanishes from view
CLAIRE
Wait a minute I just want--

Something bumps against the fence Claire draws back She
hears heavy breathing

MRS FEUR
(sniffling)
Who are you

CLAIRE
Its MrsIts ClaireSpencer From
next door Is everything--

MRS FEUR
Youre the flower lady

CLAIRE
Umyes

MRS FEUR

Claire leans closer to the tiny crack She sees a fleshy
blur and what might be part of an eye Theres no response

just the breathing

CLAIRE

She seems on the verge of losing it again

MRS FEUR

CLAIRE

Tires can be heard crunching the gravel as a car pulls into
the Feurs driveway

MRS FEUR
Oh God Hes back Im sorry Please
forget that II dont know what Im

CLAIRE
Wait Dont go

Claire listens to the sound of NAKED FOOTSTEPS followed by a
LARGE FRONT DOOR swinging shut A CAR DOOR swings open and a
MANS SHOES follow down the path

Claire pulls back from the crack and leans against the fence
as the door closes a second time She sits there for a
moment listening but all is quiet

CLAIRE (VO)
She sounded terrified

INT DINING ROOM - NIGHT

She reaches for his plate to clear it Norman grabs her hand
and kisses it

INT NORMAN AND CLAIRES ROOM - NIGHT

Norman snores softly Claire is awakened by the continuing
STORM She pads out to Normans turreted library Rain
pelts the glass Her face is briefly illuminated by the
LIGHTHOUSE BEAM

She hears the sound of a DOOR CLOSING and moves to get a
better view of the Feurs Nothing but blackness Just as
shes turning to go back to bed A LIGHTNING FLASH lights up
the night Claires eyes go wide

CLAIRES POV

In the split second of brilliance she sees Mr Feur in
shirtsleeves drenched dragging A LARGE DUFFEL toward the
open trunk of his car

CLAIRE
(in a hoarse whisper)
Norman

Hes dead to the world She calls to him again

CLAIRE

Another flash illuminatesNorman at her side

CLAIRE
Look

She stares down into the darkness
CLAIRE
Nothing There wasI thought I saw
something

NORMAN
Is it gone

THE BEACON illuminates the empty driveway She nods

NORMAN
Come on lets go back to bed

Yet another bolt of lightning reveals Claire still at the
window

EXT BACKYARD - MORNING

Claire sets up a camera and tripod She steps back and aims
her camera She glances up at a large upstairs window at the
FEURS HOUSE One side of the curtain seems to be pulled
open but no ones there

Feeling self-conscious she turns back to the camera The
morning sun hits the flowers just right and she SNAPS SEVERAL
PICTURES OF THEM against her lovely house

She glances back at the Feurs window The CURTAIN IS NOW
CLOSED

She walks over to the fence and tries to peek through it
When this doesnt work she drags a lawn chair over and peers
across the fence She can barely see over but glimpses

A DEEP FURROW in the mud of the driveway Just then a car
pulls into the driveway Claire scrambles down from her
perch

EXT DRIVEWAY - DAY

Claire walks out to find her best friend JODY pretty in
her forties wearing hip hippie-ish clothes

CLAIRE

Jody grins

JODY
See you then

Jody drives off Claire walks down the driveway to her front
door and sees Mr Feur staring at her from a window She
starts to wave but the curtain is drawn shut

Claire arrives at the front door and reaches out to touch the
doorknob She stops A FAINT RUSTLING can be heard from
within Claire quietly opens the door and moves into

INT FOYER - DAY

Claire stops inside the door Now it sounds like WHISPERING
Two voices tense impassioned It seems to be coming from
Normans study She gathers her nerve then bursts into the
room

INT NORMANS STUDY - DAY
But the whispering has suddenly stopped

CLAIRE
Hello

The lovely circular room is completely empty She looks
around puzzled Cooper the familys aging lab casually
ambles over

CLAIRE
(to Cooper)
Please tell me you heard that

EXT LAKE - DAY

Claire and Cooper out on a walk emerge onto large rocks at
the waters edge Claire tosses a long stick for Cooper who
bolts out onto the LONG WOODEN DOCK Claire gazes at the
LIGHTHOUSE across the lake and a long BRIDGE in the distance
Cooper starts BARKING and looking down into the water

Claire arrives at Coopers side and stares down into the dark
water

CLAIRE
Cooperwhat do you see

She looks down and sees nothing but her own reflection

After a moment she notices a FAINT WHITE SHAPE directly in
the reflection of her face Cooper rumbles a low growl The
shape seems to be gaining definition

RRRING

Claire gasps quietly then reaches into a pocket in her
sweater and pulls out a cordless phone

CLAIRE
(into phone)

NORMAN (VO)
(on the other end)
Im stuck here for another couple of
hours
Claires smile fades

CLAIRE
Oh

NORMAN (VO)
Unless you need me to come home

CLAIRE
No no Its fine

Claire slowly leans out over the water to check her
reflection

NORMAN (VO)
You sure

but the shape is gone

NORMAN (VO)
Claire

CLAIRE
Huh Absolutely Take your time

She clicks off the phone and looks down at the calm water
INT WORK ROOM - NIGHT

Claire sits in a small workroom at a computer She focuses
intently on the screen

ANGLE

Its ALICES COMPUTER SOLITAIRE She flips the last card and
an animated Queen of Hearts accompanied by a series of
musical notes parades across the screen

QUEEN OF HEARTS
(on computer)

Claire hits New Game and watches as a fresh hand of cyber
solitaire is dealt She suddenly has a thought and
disappears into the kitchen

INT KITCHEN - NIGHT
She glances at Jodys tea smiles then refills her glass of

red wine She picks up the phone from its cradle and moves
into
INT LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

She dials a number LOUD REGGAE can be heard blaring through

She plugs one ear

CLAIRE
Oh Well just tell her that her mother

The noise abruptly stops Claire clicks off the phone and
replaces it in the sweater pocket She tunes the stereo to a
classical music station

INT WORK ROOM - NIGHT

She walks in places the cordless phone on a BASE UNIT then
hears a different set of musical notes from the computer
She stares at the screen stunned

ANGLE

The game has been finished Cards with faces swarm
chaotically across the screen with the message YOU WIN

CLAIRE
Oh Kay

Without warning the radio dial rips cacophonously past
several stations and comes to a stop on some angry punkish
rock and roll

CLAIRE
Jesus

She bolts around a corner to the stereo The music is
chaotic and deafening She finds Cooper growling atno
one She turns off the stereo Cooper suddenly bolts down
the hall She follows him

INT FOYER - NIGHT

The foyers empty but the front door is open Claire
nervously walks out and looks around
CLAIRE
Cooper

POV - THE GARDEN
No sign of the dog

Claire turns to go back inside When she touches the
doorknob she hears the whispering again A fleeting shadow
draws her eye to a COAT RACK MIRROR which reflects directly
into the study

The whispering stops
INT NORMANS LAB - NIGHT

Claire walks in to find Norman surrounded by several GRAD
STUDENTS At school hes a very different man pressed shirt
and tie hair neatly brushed back Theyre preforming some
unseen procedure on a live sheep in a containment harness
She stops by the door to watch him

NORMAN

He measures out the liquid from a blue plastic bottle into an
apparatus connected to an inhalation mask on the sheep

NORMAN
Prudence heres an old friend

He moves to the sheeps head and strokes it as he nods to
Courtney who turns a valve on the apparatus The sheep
suddenly goes completely still Norman moves around and
begins a brief procedure

NORMAN
I try to stay on her good side because I
owe her my career and most of our grant
money Why else

He completes the procedure They look at him blankly

NORMAN
Always do unto others as youd have

Groans laughter He stops Claire

NORMAN

of the chemicals into a LEATHER CASE

NORMAN
(warm)

out of the room

NORMAN

Claire ponders this Norman turns off the light and joins
her on the bed He kisses her knee

NORMAN
Do the brilliant Norman stuff some more
Then starts working his way up her thigh

NORMAN
And speak up

Claire smiles
INT LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON

Claire sits frozen cello between her legs bow hovering in
position After an uncomfortable long pause she touches bow
to string drawing in a breath at the power of the sound

Claire takes another deep breath then launches into a
beautiful and melancholy piece of music Shes very very
good Eyes closed Her body begins to sway slightly as her
left hand vibratos like butterfly wings on the neck

She reaches a difficult transition and falters She seems
almost surprised She attacks the transition again and
again falters Claire bites her lower lip and tries yet
again this time failing completely

She sits back in the chair despondent Almost as an
afterthought she sadly drags the bow across strings At the
end of the tone something catches her ear She can just
make out the HINT OF A FAINT FEMININE VOICE echoing the tone

She sits up and plays a different note then another Each
time the soft mournful voice becomes more distinct Finally
she plays a sharp higher pitched note The voice echoes
with a distinct unsettling shriek

CRASH
INT NORMANS STUDY - DUSK
Claire walks in and sees

INSERT-- Lying on the floorA FRAMED NEWSPAPER PHOTOGRAPH
OF NORMAN AND CLAIRE

The caption announces that hes being promoted to the
distinguished DUPONT CHAIR IN GENETICS Through the
spiderwebbed glass Norman can be seen shaking hands with an
older academic hugging a smiling Claire to his side

Claire kneels down to gather the picture A single shard of
glass is missing She finds it a foot away by a distinctive

knot in the wood floor

She notices a COPPER GLINT in the point of glass but when
she moves it its gone She places the pieces of broken
glass on the frame and stands

Out of the window directly in front of her sees Mr Feur

FIREBALLS next to his chair He proffers it to Claire

DR DRAYTON
Fireball

CLAIRE
Youre joking

He shakes his head She shrugs then grabs one and pops it
into her mouth

DR DRAYTON
Its hard because Im a complete stranger
and what were talking about is
incredibly personal Besides the first
time most people come here a part of
them is wondering if Im gonna think
theyre crazy

She sucks on the fireball and slowly nods

DR DRAYTON
Dont worry Im required to have at
least three sessions in order to commit

Her eyes get a little wider

DR DRAYTON
Now thats a joke

She manages an unsteady smile

DR DRAYTON
I have some training at helping people
through the stressful moments in life

stuff off your chest great If not

moment

starts to move across the board

CLAIRE

The planchette comes to rest on the letter M Moments
later it starts to move again drifting over and stopping on

He watches her calmly some empathy on his face

DR DRAYTON
Whether you imagined it or not you

concern

CLAIRE
Yes but

DR DRAYTON
Your friend saw them

CLAIRE

hysteria

it the fuller it became

DR DRAYTON
Youre saying you willed these events to

happen

Claire finishes her tirade Dr Drayton lets her settle for
a moment

DR DRAYTON

far less concerned with whether things
you saw existed than I am with why you
saw them

She takes in the ramifications of that

jangly but surprisingly melodic song Her eyes race across
the faces of a BUTCH FEMALE DRUMMER an emaciated
GUITARISTSINGER and stop on the BASS PLAYERCaitlin She
rocks back and forth to her own hypnotic bass line EYES
CLOSED SWAYING TO THE MUSIC

a closed sign

She steps back out to the window and looks in On display

Suddenly her eye stops on a small silver bracelet with an
intricate ROSEBUD

where she spots a small ORNATE COPPER CHEST Protruding
from its lockTHE INTERLOCKED CIRCLES Claire looks like

stands there frozen The lighthouse beam sweeps past her

He walks out Claire walks over and stands before the box
INT BEDROOM - NIGHT

Claire walks into the bedroom The shower can be heard
through the bathroom door which is partially ajar Steam
drifts out through the crack

She stands in her dressing room and catches sight of her
weary distraught countenance in the mirror She glances
down

CLAIRES POV
The necklace still in her hand

She looks up again into the mirror Her face goes strangely
blank and almost mechanically she clasps the necklace onto
her neck

Suddenly she stares over at the CORDLESS PHONE lying on the
bed for a long moment She walks over picks up the phone
and looks at it

CLAIRES POV
The redial button

She stares at the bathroom door then hits the button Two
rings then

VOICE

(on phone)
Directory assistance

Claires eyes widen in terror She clicks off the phone
and taking it with her starts moving toward the door to the
hall She keeps a steady eye trained on the bathroom She
quietly pulls open the hallway door

Suddenly A HAND WITH A WASHCLOTH IS THRUST OVER HER FACE

Claire shoves Normans hand away and runs past him down the
hall

INT HALLWAY - NIGHT

Shes nearly at the top of the stairs when her body starts to
falter She tumbles over dropping the phone which clatters
down the stairs before her

Claire is pulling herself down the stairs moaning in terror
Norman can be seen calmly following her waiting for the
Halothane to take its full effect Finally she freezes
Norman picks up the phone and stands over her

NORMAN
God how did we come to this

He picks her gently up in his arms and starts carrying her
slowly up the stairs

NORMAN
The ghost stuff that was impressive

CLAIRES POV
Ceiling shapes

NORMAN
I figure you saw her that day in the
house and just gradually intuited the
whole damn thing That would be pretty
astonishing A passive-aggressive
masterpiece

INT BATHROOM - NIGHT
And into the bathroom

NORMAN
Wasnt until the shower that I realized
you actually believed it Nearly froze to
death waiting for you Thought the
circuit breaker would kick back over and
Id be toast

then shes lowered into the tub

NORMAN
The crazy thing isI have never for one
moment stopped loving you

He actually wipes a tear from his eye He kisses her lips
We can feel her revulsion His face over her

NORMAN
Dont worry about Caitlin Im sure in
some tragic way thisll bring us closer
together
He turns on the faucets then moves out of her line of
vision Sound of a number being dialed

NORMAN (0S)
Hey its Norman Listen we had a huge
blowout so Im going down to sleep at
the lab I guess youre out but
maybeif you wouldnt mind stopping by
to check on her in the morning

She glances down and sees on the edge of the tuba
prescription bottle of VALIUM with her name on the label
Her eyes go wide

NORMAN (0S)
Its justJdody its bad Ive never
seen her like this
(he trails off choking up)
I dont really know what to do anymore

Norman lit periodically by the sweep of the light house
beacon squats with the phone and gazes down at her

NORMAN
If anything ever happened to her Id
(beat)
Anyway thanks

Claire mute glances frantically around One of her fingers
begins to flutter

NORMAN
(tearfully)
Im so sorry

The tub is rapidly filling He checks his watch then
reaches for the Valium As much from will as the drug
beginning to fade Claire lets out a garbled cry

CLAIRE
(sloppy guttural)
Mmmuh

NORMAN
Shhhh

CLAIRE
(slurry)
Mauduh

Norman stops
NORMAN
What

CLAIRE
MADISON

Norman seems unnerved that shes still clinging to her belief
in the ghost

NORMAN
Thats a little much dont you think

He sees the necklace on her neck

NORMAN
Oops Cant have that

He puts down the bottle of Valium then reaches around
Claires neck to remove the necklace When his hands close
on the clasp his face suddenly goes slack

NORMANS POV
His arms around MADISONS BEAUTIFUL CORPSE

Norman explodes backwards slamming his head into the BRASS
SHOWER NOZZLE He staggers out of the bathroom before
collapsing with a thud The water finally rises above
Claires nostrils

Claire somehow manages to work a toe into the plug chain and
yank it free The water slowly descends

When it seems that her lungs must burst her mouth finally
clears the descending water She chokes in great gulps of
air

The drug is finally wearing off Claire sits up Normans
unconscious feet can be seen outside of the doorway She
turns off the water and stands unsteadily

She looks around for the phone and finally spots the little

antenna protruding from under Norman She delicately pulls

the phone out of his back pocket only to discover that its
been broken by his fall She drops it and walks quietly out
of the room

INT STAIRWAY - NIGHT

Claire stumbles as fast as she can down the stairs
INT FOYER - NIGHT

She fumbles for some KEYS in a basket by the door then looks
at the cell phones recharging cradle Its empty

She spots Normans coat hanging on the coat rack and rifles
through the pockets She finds the phone and flips it open
to see if its working A drop of something splats on the
phone Then another Its blood

She looks up and sees Norman his forehead gashed glaring
down from the landing

She reaches for the door knob but the keys and cell phone in
her hand make it difficult to open Norman hurls himself
over the banister THUD

A BLOODY HAND yanks her backwards Claire slams into the
corner by the armoir Norman advances on her At the last
moment she throws her shoulder into the armoir which tumbles
over on Norman

EXT DRIVEWAY - NIGHT

Claire races over to the Volvo which is blocked by NORMANS
PICKUP the dark hulk of THE SAILBOAT on a trailer behind it

She starts to get into the pickup then remembers to look in
the bednobody there

INT PICKUP - NIGHT

The truck is cold and doesnt want to turn over She stares
at the door for signs of Norman

CLAIRE
Come oncome on

and VROOM the truck roars to life Claire spews gravel
as she barrels the cumbersome rig out of the driveway
constantly watching the door

When she veers to the right out of the driveway she looks
into the rear view mirror The boat momentarily blocks the
open door then clears Still nothing

EXT DIRT ROAD - NIGHT

Claire wheels the truck and trailer out onto a two-lane road

INT PICKUP - NIGHT
Shivering with cold and adrenalin she tries to work the
ancient heater She turns onto THE BRIDGE

EXT BRIDGE - NIGHT

The PICKUP and BOAT race across the deserted bridge

INT PICKUP - NIGHT

ANGLE

Claire through the windshield Her face striped by the
reflection of the bridge lights which whip one-by-one across
the windshield She flips open the cell phone and punches in
911 It blinks NO SERVICE

CLAIRE
Shit

She glances into the rear view mirror
CLAIRES POV

A stern section of the boats COVERING TARP untied flapping
in the breeze

Claire desperately punches the talk button againNO
SERVICE Shes past the center of the bridge She looks
again ROAM Claire punches the talk button again
SMASH

A TRAILER CRANK punches through the window Normans arm
follows coiling like a python around Claires neck his grim
visage pressed against the glass

She squashes down the accelerator
EXT BRIDGE - NIGHT

The trailer starts to weave from side to side swerving the
pickup Claire chokes then blacks out

EXT BRIDGE - NIGHT

The Pickup and trailer smash through the railing barreling
over bumpy terrain straight toward the BOAT RAMP

The truck hits the water at fifty and Norman is hurtled
through the rear window and into the passenger side
dashboard
INT PICKUP - MOMENTS LATER

Claire is unconscious in the drivers seat a trickle of
blood runs from her nose Norman stirs briefly as Claire
groggily comes to She hears the hissing of the smashed
radiator then sees Norman a shattered bloody mess on the
floor of the cab

She leans over to see if hes dead hears a squeak and
realizes that the pickup with the BATTERED SAILBOAT AND
TRAILER miraculously still attached is rolling deeper into
the water

Before she can get the door open the truck is half
submerged She frantically manages to lower her window
halfway and starts to pull herself out

Her ribs have just cleared the glass when a bloody fist locks
onto her ankle and yanks her inside Norman pulls her down
until theyre face to face

CLAIRE
NormanNO

She yanks the emergency brake but its too latethe
submerged wheels lock and slide slowly down the mossy ramp
The truck is nearly submerged

CLAIRE
(desperately)
Norman please

The water is up to the windows Norman shakes his head
slowly as he blinks away blood from his eyes

CLAIRE
Think of Caitlin

Water sprays in through the hole in the rear window and
momentarily blinds Norman Claire jerks free and scrambles
out of the drivers side window as the truck sinks

Just as shes free of the window she jerks to a stop She
looks down and sees Norman half out of the window one hand
clamped onto her ankle

There is a wrenching metallic creak The truck lurches
downwardthen silence IT DOESNT SINK The boat buoys it
like a fishing cork as it drifts out into the lake

The headlights pierce the darkness of the steep underwater
drop off Claire tries to swim free but Normans not
letting go

Suddenly metal snaps and the truck pops free of the trailer
It hurtles downwards and the still-glowing headlights
reveal

MADISONS SUBMERGED MUSTANG

SMASH

When the front of the pickup lands on the hood of the car
the Mustangs windshield shatters A PALE SHAPE FLOATS
UPWARD

Norman is suddenly entangled by something He tries to brush
it free but comes face-to-face with MADISONS GHASTLY
DECOMPOSED FACE The last of his air bellows out of him ina

scream as he releases Claires ankle

His dead staring face separates from Madisons as the truck
slowly tilts back and sinks to the bottom

EXT LAKE - DAWN
Claire breaks the surface with a huge intake of air
CUT TO
UNDERWATER - DAWN
The sound of a furious cello solo
COLD STARING EYES
Norman half out of the truck arms floating

Follow his eyes to THE PALE CORPSE drifting above tethered
to the Mustang by an old seat belt around her ankle

Move through the murky water toward the corpses clothed
back As she twists into view

MORPHS INTO MADISONS PALE BEAUTIFUL FACEat peace

Camera drifts moves upward and breaks the surface as the
distant lights of EMERGENCY VEHICLES approach

CUT TO
FINGERS

filled with moist earth A hand tosses the clump of dirt
onto

EXT CEMETERY - DAY

A CASKET

Widen to reveal Claire dressed in black stepping away from
the grave A tiny arm snakes around her waist She glances
down to see Caitlin her eyes shining clasping her mother

tightly Claire takes a last look into the grave

CLAIRE
Rest in peace

THE GRAVESTONE - MADISON ELIZABETH FRANK

Mother and daughter turn and step back Next to them also
in black is MRS FRANK

CUT TO
FINGERS
Racing across the neck of a cello The solo continues and
now reaches the difficult transition that had stumped Claire
before
WIDEN TO REVEAL
INT A LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Claire her hair short and sexy eyes tightly shut brow
beaded with sweat The piece builds to a dark passionate
crescendo
Her eyes remain shut for a moment then flutter open

CLAIRES POV

A New York apartment the glimmering skyline visible through
a large window Cooper gazes up attentively

Claire sips a glass of wine her face unsmiling but serene
FADE OUT

THE END
