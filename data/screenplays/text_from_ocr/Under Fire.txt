One of the Sandinistas brings Pedro his rumpled

them
He speaks in broken but understandable English
PEDRO
Americans Journalists
CLAIRE AND PRICE

Pedro lights up and runs to a shelf where he returns
witha

baseball he is signing

PEDRO
Ah I put my autograph on this ball

SANDINISTA 1
(in Spanish)
Pedro There is no time to waste

Pedro is more interested in the two Americans

PEDRO
When you get back to the United
States I want you to give this ball
to Tippy Martinez for me He is from
Nicaragua

Pedro hands Claire the baseball as the Sandinistas
plead

with Pedro for his help He is more interested in
getting

the baseball delivered to Tippy Martinez Claire
accepts the

ball graciously exchanges awkward glances with Price
and

puts it in her shoulder bag

interior of ornate altars and burning candles The

party is led to a small corner of the sanctuary where a
rickety ladder leads up to the roof

THE SANDINISTAS SCRAMBLE UP THE LADDER as it sways
follows with his sack of contact bombs Then Price goes
as the Priest holds the ladder The American is much
than the Nicaraguans -- the ladder squeaks and sways

gradually die down Claire falls asleep -- exhausted

there is

nothing to say -- but the silence is interrupted by a
familiar

voice that is polite unforced and sincere

VOICE OF HUB KITTLE
It was the best I would do under the
circumstances The casket I mean

Awkward silence until they realize that hes sincere
