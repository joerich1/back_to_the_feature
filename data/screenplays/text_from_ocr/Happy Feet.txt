HAPPY FEET

Screenplay by

(Early Draft)

SPACE
Distant STARS with vast tracts of darkness stretching
between them Move in on OUR SUN dwarfed in the immense

cosmic ocean

MUMBLE (VO)
You ever feel small

Moving in on

PLANET EARTH

The spinning blue marble

FADE IN A strange cacophony of MUSIC growing louder as the
familiar CONTINENTS revolve below us and we spiral down onto
ANTARCTICA

THE ICE SHELF

Vast pristine stupendous Washed with dawn light A few
small BLACK-SUITED FIGURES are moving towards us

MUMBLE (VO)
Like youre no-one cos the world is full

of us and everyones the same

Wait a minute These arent humans they are PENGUINS
MUMBLE (CONTD)
How do you stand out from the crowd
How do you find someone special

A GREAT COMMUNITY

EMPEROR PENGUINS all over the place Its chaos - Grand
central station - with everyone SINGING to each other

MUMBLE (VO)
I know I know You sing your heart
out Thats how mum found dad in the
first place

Follow a female penguin as she waddles through the massive
crowd past an assortment of crooning males

KEEN MALE
(trying to connect)
BabeI got you Babe

She ignores him
NEXT MALE

(giving it his all)
When a man loves a woman

She keeps moving until she sees the male of her dreams
WISHFUL

Love me tender love me true all my
dreams fulfil

He stands a bit apart from the rest And what a voice What a
hip movement She sings along

NORMA J AND WISHFUL
for my darling I love you and I always

will

MUMBLE (VO)
With them it was love at first song

Close up on the two penguins as their necks intertwine

MUMBLE (VO) (CONTD)
But with me everything was a different
right from the moment I was born

THE ICE SHELF

With infinite care THE EGG is passed from Norma Js feet
onto WISHFULs

MUMBLE
First rule of survival get yourself laid
before winter

WISHFUL covers the egg glancing up at the darkening sky

MUMBLE (CONTD)
Apparently I only just made it

Women are leaving and heading off over the ice The community
resounds with sad songs of parting

MUMBLE (CONTD)
Afterwards Mum went off to the sea to
keep warm Dad stayed home like dads do
incubating

Norma J is having difficulty tearing herself away Finally
she pads off after the others

WISHFUL
Safe home baby

As he watches her dwindle into the distance where huge STORM
CLOUDS are building

WISHFUL (CONTD)
Ill miss you

THE DARKNESS

Wind comes shreiking across the ice shelf to where THOUSANDS
OF MALES are huddled ice crusting on their feathers

MUMBLE (VO)

Tell me what it is about the cold and the
dark Soon as the sun goes away everyone
gets religious

The huddled penguins are engaged in ritual chanting

LEAD VOICE
When all others leave

CHORUS
We Remain

LEAD VOICE
When the Sun vanishes

CHORUS
We Remain

INSIDE THE HUDDLE

The adult males are packed shoulder to shoulder looking
downwards at the eggs balanced on their feet

CU on the Lead male a CARUSO

( )

CARUSO
Deny the pangs of hunger
Seal the gaps Share the warmth
MUMBLE (VO)
Carusos the leader because hes so
incredibly old Some say more than 40
but you know how penguins exaggerate
OUTSIDE

WINDWARD PENGUINS peel off and walk around to the leeward
side WISHFUL is among them

CARUSO

Each one taking his turn to defy the
wind

WIDE SHOT

The MASSED VOICES rise above the gale the frosty plumes of
their breath forming a shared “thought bubblea benevolent
UBERPENGUIN
CARUSO

As we invoke the Great One Penguin of
Penguins

WISHFUL
(pushing back inside)
OK Invoke But keep moving
MUMBLE (VO)
My dad was never that devout Often his
mind was on other stuff

As the chanting builds a little thought-bubble appears next
to the communal imagination An image of Norma J
NORMA J
(Sings)
I wanna be loved by you alone and
nobody else by you boo boo pee doo
WISHFUL raises his head breaking the seal A little puff of
steam escapes

WISHFUL
Amen to that honey

VARIOUS PENGUINS
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa pal

Ya lettin out the heat
Penguins around him start jostling to close the gap

PENGUINS
»Quit shovin

Hey watch where youre putting your
feet

CARUSO

Brothers BROTHERS

The Devotions

An egg rolls out of the HUDDLE and onto the ICE

WISHFUL

Oh no I dropped it

Wheres my egg
WISHFUL barges out of the huddle retrieves the egg and
waddles back into the warmth again

WISHFUL (CONTD)
Stokay Sokay No harm done

MUMBLE (VO)
I guess he was wrong about a lot of

things

Pulling back till the powerful rhythmic chanting is drowned
out by the HOWLING GALE

WISHFUL
But I did learnt this from him the
power of positive thinking

We are moving in again towards the huddle the voices of the
Great Male Gathering begin to cut through the wind blasts

Louder and louder until

ELDER
By the power of our Devotions

ALL PENGUINS
We turn the world once more

ELDER
By our devotion to the Wisdoms

ALL PENGUINS
We bring back the sun

The CHANTING crescendos awe-inspiring as it rises above the
sound of the gale and as if in response

THE EARTH TURNS

The CURTAIN OF DARKNESS which overshadows Antarctica begins
to LIFT from the curvature of the southern hemisphere The
vast ice-continent is BRILLIANTLY ILLUMINATED once more

ON THE ICE SHELF

The ICE itself is moaning and groaning like a living thing

A SINGLE CRACK appears and widens then forks and forks
again

The whole expanse of fast-ice is DISINTEGRATING starting at
the sea-ice and progressing towards the ice-cliffs

Somewhere an ICEBERG breaks free from the face of a glacier
and smashes down into the frozen sea below At the same
time

THE EMPEROR COMMUNITY

An EGG cracks open then another then all in a rush like
POPCORN

Fathers are calling out to each other as their fluffy CHICKS
emerge to greet the daylight

EXCITED FATHERS

Its a boy

Its a girl

What a peach
-What a bruiser

Amongst the excited crowd of males and hatchlings we find
WISHFUL staring down at his egg still balanced on his feet

FRIENDLY PENGUIN
Late opener huh You thinks its alive

WISHFUL
Ill say Listen

He taps the egg with his beak Bending close they hear a
TAPPING SOUND in REPLY

FRIENDLY PENGUIN
Well how about that

WISHFUL taps again The tapping comes back louder A TINY
FOOT pops out of the egg Then ANOTHER The Egg flips and
lurches off in a giddy DANCE

WISHFUL
Whoa lil buddy slow down

THE FRIENDLY PENGUINS chick giggles at the DANCING EGG
which finally trips and cracks depositing baby MUMBLE

MUMBLE
(hopping from one foot to the
other)
Ow Freezy Fuh-Fuh-Freeezy All Freezy

OTHER PENGUINS
Jdees
»You ever see a chick move like that
before
is he damaged
is he deranged

They gather round staring down at this strange little jigging
ball of fluff

WISHFUL
What Come on Hell grow out of it

Shovelling MUMBLE off the ice and into his BROOD POUCH

WISHFUL (CONTD)
Come here lil Mumble Lets get you
warm and toasty

Mumble SNUGGLES contentedly between his fathers legs
surveying his new world The friends chick ELLA is staring
at him fascinated

ELLA
Get him to do it again Daddy

FRIENDLY PENGUIN
Shh Quiet

She disappears under his brood pouch
MUMBLE
(looks up)
So What happens now Dad

WISHFUL
We Wait

THE ICE
A LONG LINE of male penguins thousands of them all with
their chicks stand staring expectantly across the ice shelf

At the front we find WISHFUL and MUMBLE who is jiggling
with anticipation hopping from one foot to the other

MUMBLE
Is she coming soon

WISHFUL
Any day now

MUMBLE
Tell me again what shes like

WISHFUL
(sings)
a wiggle when she walks a giggle when
she talks makes my world go round

MUMBLE does a little SOFT SHOE SHUFFLE
WISHFUL (CONTD)

(sharply)
Hey Thought I told you not to do that

MUMBLE
Sorry When I get happy my feet get happy
too

WISHFUL

Well tell em dont

MUMBLE
But Why Dad

Caruso waddles past A stern glance down at little Mumble as
he carries on along the line

WISHFUL
“Cos it aint penguin

LATER
MIST rises off the ice shelf The males are still waiting
with their chicks Over this The sound of Chicks crying

MUMBLE between his fathers feet follows his fathers
concentrated gaze

MUMBLE
Gee Im hungry

WISHFUL
Everyones hungry son The mommas are
bringing fish soon

Long pause

MUMBLE
Whats fish look like

WISHFUL
Youll see it when she brings one

STILL LATER
The baby penguins are HOWLING now
Anxious fathers lean forward peering into the distance

Out of the thickening mist a cluster of little BLACK DOTS
materialises

PENGUIN LOOKOUTS
Wives-ho Wives-ho
-Hubba-hubba Wives-ho
Better late than never

The distant females look exhausted as they totter unsteadily
across the ice towards their partners The MALES break ranks
and rush towards the distressed females

MALE PENGUINS
Barbra-Ann
-Peggy Sue

(MORE )
( )

MALE PENGUINS (CONTD)
-Hey Paula
-Roxanne

A tumult of re-unions as partners find each other But no
luck for WISHFUL
WISHFUL
NORMA J

Weaving anxiously through the throng overhearing

MALE1
Youre not as fat as I thought youd be

FEMALE1

FEMALE2
Even the squid were hard to get
We had to swim forever

FEMALE3
Everyone split up A lot of the gals

MALE 2
Delilah

MALE 3
Gloria Gloria

WISHFUL is running frantically through the crowd singing
all the time in the hope of being recogniosed

WISHFUL
Since my baby left me I found a new
place to dwell
Down the bottom of lonely street at
heartbreak hotel

MUMBLE hippity-hops after his father trying to keep up

WISHFUL (CONTD)
Woah Im so lonely baby Im so lonely

Moving beyond the crowd WISHFUL sees a last few stragglers
Amongst them

NORMA J
WISHFUL
WISHFUL
(overcome)
O Honey O Baby You made it

She staggers into his waiting flippers

WISHFUL (CONTD)
You hurt

NORMA J
(breathless)
Just tired and hungry is all
It was dreadful out there

Over WISHFUL shoulder she sees the infant Mumble HIPPITY-
HOPPING towards them

NORMA J

WISHFUL

Mumbles feet start to tap involuntarily Then he catches his
dads warning look

MUMBLE

WISHFUL
Later bud Give your ma time to
regurgitate

NORMA J

MUMBLE
(yells ecstatically)
I got one I got a mum everyone I got a
MUM

THE GREAT COMMUTE
The ICE-SHELF is as busy as a freeway at peak hour with males
and females are hurrying BACK AND FORTH from the sea

MUMBLE (VO)
After that with food being so scarce
everyone was busy busy busy Mom and dad
were working so hard I didnt see much of
them Besides I had school to go to

THE CRECHE

uninhibited and unselfconscious

After some time he remembers himself stops and turns to the
Mrs Astrakhan who is BANGING HER HEAD against a lump of ice

MRS ASTRAKHAN (CONTD)
Disaster Catastroff I never fail
Never

THE ICE SHELF
Follow Mumble as he wanders alone back towards his class

He stops some distance away listening to the other kids who
are now performing with increasing virtuosity

Ella is among them her clear high voice borne to him on the
wind

Mumble sighs and his little shoulders sink no way hell ever
be able to sing like that

MUMBLE
Its tough when you realise youll never
fit in Plus I was beginning to moult
A piece of downy fluff is peeling off one wing
MUMBLE (CONTD)
I couldnt face the class in this mood So

I just kept going

Music over Walk on By as he wanders through the vast colony
head down against the wind little feet padding over the ice
Gradually the colony begins to thin

MUMBLE (CONTD)
Looking for what I dont know A
different type of penguin

The noise of the colony has faded behind him He stops and
looks up

MUMBLE (CONTD)
And thats exactly what I found

THE EDGE

Before him a wasteland of discoloured ice covered with
broken eggs and bits of feather There are very few penguins
here and the ones he can see are all frankly weird

A Penguin walks in an endless figure of eight muttering to
himself Another has his flippers wrapped tightly around
himself like a straightjacket A troubled Penguin sings
angrilyTheres no business like show business

CU on Mumble As he looks back to the sanctuary of the colony
and then back out over the wasteland

MUMBLE
Not the nicest place in the world but at
least you could do what you liked here

Fade in Music (Im Free by the Who) and Mumble is off
skittering over the rubbish strewn ice little feet dancing
to his hearts content until

a shadow passes over him and

Whump a huge SKUA BIRD twice Mumbles size with a cruel
flesh-eating beak lands on the ice right on front of him

SKUA
Hey whacha doin dere flipperbird
MUMBLE
Me Oh nothing What are you doing

THREE MORE SKUAS descend MUMBLE is surrounded

SKUA1
Oh we just dropped in for a spota lunch
Hey hey hey

MUMBLE

SKUA1

Their dark eyes fix on Mumble He is starting to feel uneasy
and backs away

MUMBLE
But but Im a penguin

SKUA1

The FIRST SKUA moves in on MUMBLE

They fall over each other fighting to take up Mumbles
invitation

The Skuas stop momentarily

MUMBLE (CONTD)

He does a wild little TAPDANCE hoping to distract them

FIRST SKUA
(unimpressed)
Nope

He knocks Mumble down and places his HUGE CLAW on his chest

FIRST SKUA (CONTD)
Ok boys for once we gonna do dis
civilised Now

The FIRST SKUA opens his beak to strike Mumble has noticed a
YELLOW PLASTIC BAND around the Skuas leg

MUMBLE
Hey Whats that on your leg

The FIRST SKUA halts his attack

FIRST SKUA

OTHER SKUAS

He turns and whacks the other SKUAS over the head with his
wing

bloodshot eye)

FIRST SKUA

to their better nature

MUMBLE
So - You think I could appeal to your
better nature

FIRST SKUA
Nice try kid But No

He opens his beak wide as MUMBLE stumbles backwards and falls
into a narrow CREVICE in the ice

FIRST SKUA (CONTD)
Hey Whatcha think ya doin down dere
flipperbird Get back up here dis minute

The other Skuas move in to help MUMBLE cowers in the CRACK
as they spear at him with their beaks

SKUAS
Come on out witcha

They cant get hold of him Frustrated they turn on the
FIRST SKUA squabbling and whacking each other with their
wings

Great Yellaleg

screwy alientalk
FIRST SKUA
Hey Dont peck me or Ill peck you and
when I peck you know youve been
pecked (fade)

MUMBLE watches from the safety of the crack as they fight and
argue viciously among themselves

MUMBLE (VO)
Compared with that school almost seemed
like fun

THE CRECHE

MUMBLE stands some distance back from where the other young
penguins are taking school lessons

MUMBLE (VO)
Most days I hid at the back dreaming
about the world beyond

MUMBLE looks up at a cloud that resolves itself into the
unmistakable shape of a FISH As he watches the cloud morphs
into something that resembles a WHALE Then morphs again
intoa SEAL Then into the shape of an upright CREATURE with
bulging eyes and tentacled hands

MUMBLE
Time passed We all grew up

TIME LAPSE

As the class transforms into moulting adolescents

MUMBLE (VO)
But right up to graduation I never did
find my heartsong

LATER THE GRADUATION CEREMONY
Dozens of MATURE ADOLESCENTStheir coats almost fully moulted
to reveal the sleek shiny black and white feathers

underneath

They stand in a group talking excitedly until the lead
penguin Caruso walks up and everyone falls silent
CARUSO
Graduates today you leave the safety of
our community for the first time
forsaking the trusted solid ice for the
terrible magic of the deep

MUMBLE (VO)
Caruso He couldnt help himself

CARUSO
Things are not as they were For five
years now we have known nothing but
famine But you are our hope Upon your
survival depends the very future of the
entire Penguin Nation Dive deep swim
far May the Great Penguinus go with you
And remember

With solemn gravity CARUSO throws his flippers into the air
and shouts

CARUSO
Excelsi-yah Yah yah yah

MASSED GRADUATES
Excelsi-yah Yah yah yah

AWAY FROM THE CRECHE

Follow Mumble as he returns to his parents In his adult

plumage hes distinguishable by a small birthmark like a
bowtie on his chest and a small tuft of down on his head

which has not yet moulted off

Music Over Schools Out by Alice Cooper

MUMBLE
Dad Ma can I go with the others

NORMA J puts a protective flipper around her son
NORMA-J
I dont know Wishful I still dont think

hes ready

MUMBLE
Dad Ill learn to sing later Ill find
my voice out there In the deep Truly

Glancing round he sees the class moves off en masse across
the iceheading for the sea

MUMBLE (CONTD)
Dad Pul-eeeze

Wishful leans forwards pulls off Mumbles tuft with his beak

MUMBLE (CONTD)
Yeooow

WISTFUL
On you go then buddy

MUMBLE
Thanks Pop See ya Ma

He races off Norma J calling after him

NORMA J
(calling after)
Remember Stranger Danger Never talk to
a seal

Mumble turns to wave falls over gets up and races on after
the others with his strange hippity-hop little gait

Watching from a distance Norma J wipes away tears

NORMA J (CONTD)
Oh my Stupid Im sorry

Wishful pats her comfortingly

NORMA J
(quietly to WISHFUL)
You think well ever see him again

WISHFUL

(Shrugs)
Its out of our flippers

THE HIGHWAY TO THE SEA

A high shot reveals the miles of frozen ice that the
GRADUATES have to cover to get to the sea
Some are shuffling along on their feet others are
tobogganing

A long way behind them we see the lone figure of MUMBLE
racing to catch up

AT THE EDGE OF THE ICE

The juvenile penguins stand in a bunch peering down looking
for somewhere to dive in

GRADUATE PENGUINS
What do you think here
Are you kidding
-How about over here then

They shuffle off in a group to a nearby spot

GRADUATE
That last place looked better

OTHERS
I agree
-Much better

They all shuffle back to the previous spot and stand there
frozen by indecision

GRADUATE
then again

Suddenly the little dark figure of MUMBLE barrels through the
pack yelling

MUMBLE
Outta my way flipperbirds Coming
through

For a long moment hes airborne

Thenhe hits the water with a strangled squawkand
disappears

GRADUATES
What was that

ELLA
Mumble
They tentatively crane over the edge No sign of him They
peer into the water

GRADUATE
Lunatic
where did he go
See any blood

ThenMUMBLE shoots out of the water like a missile

MUMBLE
Whatcha waiting for Its
fantast(splosh)

as he falls back under water again

ELLA
Go Mumble

Without hesitation ELLA follows him

The others follow ELLA A few at first then all of them en
masse leap yelling and hollering

SURFACE UNDERWATER
The penguins flounder around flapping laughing and choking
MUMBLE

I had an instinct Id be good at this
Actually we all were We were the best

UNDERWATER

Transformed into creatures of grace and exuberance they
swoop and dive trailing plumes of bubbles

Over this the music of THE BEACH BOYS

BEACH BOYS
Suntanned bodies and the waves of
sunshine
Those California girls and the beautiful
coastline

In the warmed up weather lets get
together and do it again

Two PENGUINS shoot up through HOLES IN THE ICE
THE SURFACE

Skidding out of control they COLLIDE ending up in a
breathless heap on top of each other

ELLA
Mumble

MUMBLE
Ella

They scramble to their feetbut the ice is slipperyThey
clutch together slipping and sliding

ELLA
Woah

MUMBLE
Ive got you No I dont

Leaning against each other they manage to stand up close
now eyes meeting

MUMBLE (CONTD)
Yes I do

A brief moment then

MALE PENGUIN
Hi Ella

MUMBLE (VO)
The only bad thing about being with Ella
It was always so darned crowded

As others pop up all around

MALE PENGUINS
Ella
Where da get to
there you are

Laughing she dives into the water The young males follow
her MUMBLE hippity-hops to the edge and tumbles in after
her
UNDERWATER

A half dozen of them gambolling together their bubble trails
intertwining

BEACH BOYS
In the warmed up weather lets get
together and do it again

Then everyone freezes as a few silvery FISH swim past

MUMBLE
FISH

They all zero in

Collisions barging a bit like water polo when the ball is
first thrown in In an instantall the fish are taken

ON THE SURFACE
MUMBLE surfaces with a fish in his beak

MUMBLE
(muffled)
Ella You get one

ELLA
Not this time

MUMBLE
(muffled)
Here have it

ELLA
Thank you Mumble but its yours

MUMBLE
(muffled)
I want you to have it

MALE PENGUIN
Why dont I have it
Suddenly A SKUA BIRD swoops down and grabs it

ELLA
Hey Thats a felony Mumble let go

Mumble hangs on Neither he not the Skua will let go The
SKUA soars higher taking MUMBLE with him

ELLA (CONTD)
(yells)
Mumble

MUMBLE is carriedhigher and higher The SKUA tries hard to
shake him off but finally gives up

SKUA
(derisive)

So fly flipperbird Fly

He lets go the fish and MUMBLE plummets downwards landing
Splat on an ice floe

ON THE ICE
Mumble lies still

Ella and the others gather around MUMBLE still has the FISH
firmly in his beak

PENGUINS
Is he breathing
-hes certainly not eating

Leaning forward to take the fish

PENGUIN
Maybe I should just

Mumble regains consciousness

MUMBLE
Hey The fish is for Ella
(to Ella)

Take it Really Its for you

ELLA leans forward takes the fish and daintily gulps it
down
ELLA
Thank you

MUMBLE
(spent)
Youre welcome

ON AN ICEBERG NIGHT

The entire sky is ablaze with the shimmering LIGHTS of the
AURORA AUSTRALIS

The PENGUINS stand below looking up in wonder They sing
ELLA AND THE OTHERS
Gotta keep those lovin good Vibrations
a happenin with her Ahhhhhhhhhhhhh
The HARMONIES are exquisite until
MUMBLE
(very loud and tuneless)
Good Good GoodGood VibRatiOns
The singing STOPS
MALE PENGUINS
-Mumble
-Knock it off
The singing RESUMES

ELLA AND THE CHOIR
Gotta keep those lovin good Vibrations
A happenin with her

Another CRESCENDO

ELLA AND THE CHOIR (CONTD)
Ahhh

MUMBLE
AaahhhhHhhhhhhhhhhhhuhhhhhh

This stops the whole thing dead ELLA pads over to him
ELLA
(gently)
Mumble the thing is

MUMBLE
I know I know

ELLA
-Its better if you just listen

She returns to the choir The singing resumesa perfect
harmonic MUMBLE cant help himself He begins to TAP DANCE

ELLA AND THE OTHERS
MUMBLE

MUMBLE
(retreating)
OK Ill quit OK
AN ICE-FLOE

We find MUMBLE on his own small ice-floe separate from the
others on their iceberg

As their singing drifts across to him MUMBLE does an
exquisite little SOFT-SHOE SHUFFLE

TIME LAPSE

As night slowly pales to a misty dawn and Mumbles lonely
floe drifts off turning slowly in the current

Music Over The tracks of my tears
MORNING
He is woken by A NUDGE at his little raft of ice
MUMBLE
(sleepily)
Woah Whose there
Another nudge

MUMBLE (CONTD)
OK Im awake now You got me
He looks around - an unfamiliar landscape of ice - then over
the side seeing nothing but slowly spreading ripples

A more VIOLENT NUDGE from behind almost makes him lose his
balance A DARK SHAPE passes swiftly through the water

MUMBLE (CONTD)
Saw you Richard Eddie Ella

The dark shape SHOOTS out of the water Its GAPING JAWS
missing Mumble by an inch

MUMBLE (CONTD)
sees aaarghH

As he recoils slips and tumbles into the WATER
UNDERWATER SURFACE

Choking thrashing and gulping air Mumble SCRAMBLES to get
back onto the ice

MUMBLE
Everybody out LEOPARD SEAL (glub)

The murderous creature comes at him jaws open baring rows
of sharp TEETH and MUMBLE swims for his life

The LEOPARD SEAL is relentless barging through smaller
floes powering around larger ones

Mumble just CANT SHAKE HIM OFF Desperate he shoots up into
the air landing on a THIN PANCAKE OF ICE that cannot support
his weight

MUMBLE (CONTD)
HEEEELP

Mumble scrambles to gain purchase but FALLS BACK INTO THE
WATER Now he is

UNDER THE ICE SHELF

caught between the SOLID ICE above him and the bottomless
black WATER below

Mumble POWERS ahead the ice above growing thicker the
angled ceiling forcing him down deeper into the BLACKNESS

The Leopard Seal opens its mouth Its GAPING JAWS are about
to engulf Mumble when

a little SPECK OF LIGHT appears in the ceiling of ice Mumble
makes a speedy sharp turn climbing steeply

He is in a FUNNEL OF ICEgetting narrower and narrower as it
rises to the surface The Leopard Seal is CLOSING fast
MUMBLE shoots THROUGH the hole in the ice and into the air

THE ICE-SHELF

A small group of ADELIE PENGUINS recoil as MUMBLE explodes
out of the hole closely followed by the LEOPARD SEAL

WHAM THUMP They belly-flop on the ice

THE ADELIES
(wincing)
Ouch
Thats gotta hurt
Who ordered seal

Mumble is quickly on his feet and out of the Leopard Seals
reach The ADELIES TAUNT the bulky creature like matadors

THE ADELIES (CONTD)
Over here
-No over here Too slow
have to lose some weight pesado

The frustrated Leopard Seal snaps and snarls impotently

MUMBLE
Yeah go chase someone your own size ya
big blubberhead

Taunting it with a cheeky little TAP DANCE The Adelies love
it

AN ADELIE
Hey amigo Do that again

MUMBLE
Do what
(defensive)
I didnt do anything

AN ADELIE
That thing with The feet
(to the others)
jHola muchachos

(to Mumble)
Show them
MUMBLE
WellI just kind of go like thisand
then this

Bolder now he does a few neat steps

THE ADELIES
-Oye Ritmo Cubana
jRiba Riba Shake those hips
YO penguino bust a move

They COPY HIM improvising little riffs on his dance step
The LEOPARD SEAL inches up behind them

THE ADELIES (CONTD)
Then mebbe something like
-No I got it Watch me

An Adelie adds an ACROBATIC variation of his own The LEOPARD
SEAL is almost upon them

MUMBLE
Or how about

MUMBLE adds a neatly executed slide just as the LEOPARD SEAL
strikes MUMBLE avoids the lunge and the creatures face
comes down hard on the ice

THE ADELIES
(to the winded Seal)
Eat my ice lardface
Kiss my frozen toosh rubber butt

They fall about laughing The Leopard Seal returns to the
water

LEOPARD SEAL
I know where you live

THE ADELIES
Yeah its called The Land tubby
Flop back anytime

Laughing hysterically at their own jokes they strut off
MUMBLE watches them go

ADELIES
-Hey aint you coming tallboy
Or you got something better to do

MUMBLE looks out at the endless sea of floating ice-pancakes
all the way to the horizon Nothing

He shrugs and hurries off after his new friends
FURTHER ON

A strange cacophony building as The four ADELIE AMIGOS and
MUMBLE crest the rise to see

ADELIE LAND

A vast boisterous ADELIE PENGUIN COMMUNITY Thousands of
them stretching as far as the eye can see Its very Rio
very samba worlds away from the sedate Emperor colony

MUMBLE
Wow there are so many of you

THE ADELIES
-Hey this is nothin’
Used to be twice as many of us
Yeah back when you could still catch a
fish

MUMBLE
The shortage has affected you too

AN ADELIE
Who you calling shortish
-All I know is a lot of us

And Some folks so hungry they eating
rocks

Sure enough An ADELIE walks by a PEBBLE in his beak

THE ADELIES
(laughing)
Eating rocks

MUMBLE
Why funny Thats terrible

ADELIES
dust kidding the rocks are for nest-
building
Thats how its works here The one with
the most rocks gets the chicas

Chica boom chica boom chica boom boom
BOOM

MUMBLE
So why arent you guys collecting them

THE ADELIES
-Cos we got personality
Without us the chicas got no boom boom
Without us the fiesta will be a siesta
Watch and learn tallboy

One of the Adelies calls to a pair of YOUNG FEMALES he sees
walking by

THE ADELIES (CONTD)
-Hola Conchita

The Adelies pose RUFFLING UP THEIR CRESTS into various
styles the MOHAWK the FLAT-TOP

THE ADELIES (CONTD)
See something you like

learned from Mumble The females are intrigued

A FEMALE

A FEMALE

THE ADELIES
»You see Some penguins got it some

They punch and bump each other playfully

MUMBLE
»you think I could get some of it

AN ADELIE
Hombre you got so much already you

He touches Mumble and recoils as if burnt

ADELIE
Yow

MUMBLE
You really think so

THE ADELIES
You got the biggest personality of any
of us
Except for me maybe
-Put that ego away Ramon you gonna hurt
someone

THE CONGA LINE

Music over Carlos Santanas Oyé Como Va
MUMBLE (VO)
So for a while I forgot about finding a
song altogether

The Adelies and Mumble form a conga weaving in and out of

the nest builders aiming a kick here and there at their

industrious brethren

UNDERWATER

MUMBLE
We were a team

the Adelies swoop and dive corralling a FEW SMALL FISH into
a CREVICE

The fish darting to and fro are suddenly confronted by
Mumbles OPEN BEAK

ON THE ICE AGAIN
Mumble shares out the catch
AN ICEBERG
MUMBLE
there was so much to do so much to

see

Mumble and the adeles come shooting down a long curving
Slippery dip

THE ADELIES

j Arriba
Addidas amigos

As they shoot off the slippery-dip and into the sea mumble
whacks his head on the edge of the ice

UNDERWATER

The Adelies shoot back up to the surface Mumble sinks
slightly dazed watching the kalaeidescope patters of the
surface recede

Music Over Ground Control to major Tom

ON THE SURFACE
ADELIES
Wheres the tall-boy
I thought he was with you

They jump back in to look for him

UNDERWATER

Mumble keeps sinking down down down into a great cathedral-
like space lit by eerie shards of underwater light

MUMBLE
stuff down there beyond my wildest
imagining

Imbedded in the base of the glacier the rusting remains of
An OLD YELLOW EXCAVATOR projecting out of the glacier

It hangs there inscrutable like a great yellow totem

Mumble dwarfed by it contemplates it for a while then
ventures inside into the body of the BEAST

INSIDE THE BULLDOZER
A rusting steering column a perforated dashboard

He pecks at the metal trying to taste it listening to the
sound it makes

OUTSIDE THE BULLDOZER

In the shimmering space outside the bulldozer the ADELIES
congregate

THE ADELIES
You sure he went in there
-Mumble
Done go near it looks like it can
bite

One of them smims closer to the great jaws

ADELIES
Ramos

Mumble pops his head out from between the jaws

MUMBLE
Oh There you are
Terrified the Adelies scatter and shoot to the surface like
missiles

MUMBLE (CONTD)
Guys I want to speak to you

THE ICE SHELF

The Adelies are heading back to their colony as fast as their
little legs will carry then Mumble Hippity hops after them

ADELIES
Forget it
Were not going back there
Never

MUMBLE

But its dead It cant hurt you

ADELIES
Maybe its got a brother still alive

MUMBLE
But thats what we have to find out
Dont you see Things like that could be
eating the fish

The idea is so stunningly original it stops them in their
tracks

ADELIES
Okay Okay Heres the plan we go and
ask the revered one

MUMBLE
The who

THE ADELIES
Reverend Loveday
The One who Knows
First we gonna need stones though

MUMBLE
Why stones Wait for me

LOVEDAYS MOUND

MUMBLE and the ADELIE AMIGOS are bunched together near the
head of a LONG QUEUE of Adelies each with a stone or in their
beak

At the head of this queue stands LOVEDAY - guardian of a huge
pile of pebbles His head pokes through one of the rings a
PLASTIC SIX-PACK CAN HOLDER festooned with seaweed like a
HOLY MANTLE

A group of Soul singers mainly female sway in the
background singing a soulful song of adoration as the
Penguin ahead of Mumble steps forward

LOVEDAY
First the devotion

The PENGUIN adds his pebble to the pile

LOVEDAY holds up a flipper for silence and a hush falls over
the gospel choir

LOVEDAY (CONTD)
A moment
(composing himself)
and your question

FIRST IN QUEUE
Sefior Loveday My wife is one of the
Disappeared ones Tell me is she alive

Loveday hyperventillates his eyes roll up in his head

LOVEDAY
The Mystic Beings are speaking to me
Yes She is alive and happy and you are
in her thoughts

FIRST IN QUEUE
But is she with another male

LOVEDAY
One pebble one question Next

The AMIGOS push MUMBLE forward He is at least a head taller
than the others

LOVEDAY (CONTD)
I senseyou are the one with the
question
ADELIE
-How does he do it
He just one look and he know

Mumble places the pebble on the pile A long Pause

LOVEDAY
A little nervous Thats normal Take
your time

In fact Mumble is mesmerised by the luight catching LOVEDAYs
six pack holder He bends forwards to study it more closely

MUMBLE
I was wondering Have You ever been
abducted by Aliens

LOVEDAY
No time wasters Next

THE ADELIES
Sefior Thats not his question Hes new
here
(prompting Mumble)
The yellow thing
-Ask him whats taking the fish

MUMBLE
(ignoring them)
»you see I met a Skua once with
something like that on his legs

LOVEDAY
Skua Leg Whats he talking about

MUMBLE
and he said he was abducted by
Aliens
LOVEDAY

(starts to wheeze and cough)
Listen friend this is my Sacred
Talisman bestowed upon me by the Mystic
Beings

MUMBLE
Looks like they bestowed it very tight
LOVEDAY
during my Epic Journey of
Enlightenment to the Forbidden Shore

MUMBLE
So these Mystic Beings did you see them

LOVEDAY
I hear them They talk to me all the time
I am their instrument They chose me

MUMBLE
Did they have frontways eyes No
feathers Fat flabby faces Did they
probe you and stick a pointy thing into
you

LOVEDAY
Enough How many questions is that You
dont have enough pebbles

ADELIES IN QUEUE
Yeah one pebble one question
Weve all got stuff to ask pal

MUMBLE
But I havent had any answers yet

LOVEDAY
SILENCIO The Mystic Beings are
speaking They say show some respect
stranger Especially to the One who
Knows

A hush falls over the gathering
LOVEDAY (CONTD)
The reason there are not enough fish is
simple There is not enough love in the
world Love is the answer

One cue the gospel choir start singing All you need is Love

LOVEDAY (CONTD)
(over this)
Okay everybody turn around to the
penguin next to you and give them a great
big hug Comeon everybodyhug This is a
safe place

The gathering hug awkwardly Mumble because of his towering
height has trouble embracing the Adelie next to him

LOVEDAY (CONTD)
Now The Mating Season starts today so
heres what everybody should do go forth
and multiply If youll excuse I myself
must retire for a moment to the couch of
indulgence okay ladies whos gonna be
first

MUMBLE and the ADELIES are jostled aside in the STAMPEDE of
FEMALES as the gospel group break ranks and mob him

FEMALE ADELIES
-Me Loveday

-Me
-No Me
LOVEDAY
One at a time And dont touch the
Talisman
ADELIES

I liked him better when he was just
plain Pedro
-Did he say it starts today

We gotta get to work guys

They start posturing for the any FEMALES they can attract
THE ADELIES
jHola Baby Get your chica boom-boom

A couple of females look up from the scrum

FEMALE
How many rocks you got
HER FRIEND
Forget ‘em honey They only one
between the six of themand they just

AN ADELIE

Wait Look

The Adelies all start DANCING MADLY but it is too frenetic
too desperate

ADELIES
»You like it

Mumble looks at them Then opens his beak and demonstrates
MUMBLE
La la la la la la la laaaaaaaaaaaaa

THE ADELIES
(to each other)
-Whats he doing
-Its a distress call
-Its world music
-Get out of here

MUMBLE

( )

MUMBLE

AN ADELIE
No problem Which ways this colony of

Leading off
ADELIES

Well all come
Yeah I like em tall
»You jus gotta do exacly as I say

THE EMPEROR COLONY
It is autumn the EMPEROR PENGUINS for the mating season
It is just like the GREAT GATHERING we saw at the beginning

of our story Males and females sing their Heartsongs And
ONE SONG stands out from all the others

Where NORMA J once sang stands ELLA now sleek and fully
mature Gathered around her in a semi-circle a half a dozen
adoring MALES
ELLA
Voulez-vous coucher avec moi ce soir
Voulez-vous coucher avec moi

Suddenly she becomes aware of a MELLIFLUOUS MALE VOICE
overlapping hers It has a curious bossa nova rhythm

MUMBLE
Tall and tanned and young and lovely
The Girl from Ipanema goes walking
And when she passes each guy she passes
goes ‘Aaaah

Ella turns to see a PENGUIN backlit by the sun standing
HEROICALLY on a little rise just as WISHFUL did

Ella recognizes those TAPPING FEET Could this be MUMBLEShe
moves closer to investigate

MUMBLE (CONTD)
Oh and I want her so badly
How can I tell her I love her
Yes I would give my heart gladly
(MORE)

MUMBLE (CONTD)
But each day when she walks to the sea
She looks straight ahead not at me

ELLA
Mumble

SINGING VOICE
Tall and tanned and young and lovely

MUMBLE
(overlapping)
Hi Ella what do you think

Ella suspicious moves to one side Mumble moves to block her
view She moves further tound and sees

THE ADELIE
jHola bonita

Obviously hes been singing while Mumble mimes

ELLA
Mumble thats just cheap
She turns and heads off The Adelie starts after her

THE ADELIE
Wait up You and me baby we can make
sweet music I may be short but Ima
love godOoww

Mumble smacks him with the back of a flipper and goes off
after Ella himself

MUMBLE
Ella Wait

She stops He takes her by the shoulders Shes upset

MUMBLE (CONTD)
Im sorry

ELLA
(shakes her head tearful)
When you left without saying goodbye I
thought something had happened then I
thought he just doesnt care

MUMBLE
Dont care I never stopped thinking
about you

ELLA
And then when I saw you singing fora
second I thought

MUMBLE
I cant sing

ELLA
I know I know Its impossible
She walks off

MUMBLE
But Ill show you something better
He TAPS an up-tempo syncopated rhythm on the ice

MUMBLE (CONTD)
Sing something to this

ELLA
(her back to him)
Whats the point Its embarrassing

MUMBLE
Just try it This once

Ella begins to hum Never Can Say Goodbye ironically and
without conviction

MUMBLE (CONTD)
Okay thatll work Just keep it going

The singing ADELIE joins inacapella very rhythmic

THE ADELIE
turn around you fool

You know I love you more and more

Right on cue the rest of the AMIGOS appear on either side of
him singing back-up

THE ADELIES
Tell me why is it so
Dont wanna let you go
I never can say goodbye nono no no

Curious ELLA TURNS

Framed between the Adelies Mumble strikes a pose holds it
for a moment then lets rip

He TAP DANCESUNINHIBITED WILD JOYOUS The ADELIES
accompany him They know all the moves and it is INFECTIOUS

FEET are beginning to tap couples are beginning to
improvise singing along trying out the dance steps

Now ELLA is caught up in it AND MUMBLE IS DANCING LIKE NO
PENGUIN HAS EVER DONE BEFORE

MUMBLE
This is it Ella This is the song inside
me

ELLA is ecstatic Just when we think the WHOLE COLONY will be
swept up into the abandon A DARK FIGURE steps forward

CARUSO
(bellows)
STOPTHISDEPRAVITY

ELLA STOPS DANCING MUMBLE misses a beat loses his footing
trips and goes sliding across the ice to the feet of CARUSO
and the ELDERS

CARUSO (CONTD)
WHAT IS THE MEANING OF THIS
ABOMINATION

MUMBLE
Im just showing them Happy Feet

CARUSO
Happy WHAT This is an OUTRAGE

The ADELIES shuffle uncomfortably Caruso turns to the rest
of the emperors

CARUSO
It is exactly this kind of disrespectful
heretic behaviour that has brought the
Scarcity upon us Dont you seewe are
being brought to account by the
Forefathers

THE ELDERS
The kid was never quite the full
Penguin
It all began the year he hatched
Thats right Hes the one who brought
the blight

MUMBLE
(astonished)
Wait Wait You think its my fault that
there are no fish Doing Happy Feet
cant cause a food shortage

AN ELDER
then what did

MUMBLE
My own opinion I think living beyond
the ice there are creatures weve never
met before Aliens Mystic Beings Big

ELDERS

(pushing in)
-He has abandoned the faith
-He has driven the fish away

THE ADELIES
(protecting Mumble)
-Come on hombre loosen up
-the tall guy was just trying to

AN ELDER
Dont touch me Heathen

He BATS the ADELIES aside like skittles Mumble intervenes

MUMBLE
BACK OFF YA SCREWY-ASS FLIPPERBIRD

THE ELDERS
(enraged)
-Skua talk Hes talking Skua talk
(MORE )

THE ELDERS (CONTD)
Hes the spawn of evil
The devil penguin

MUMBLE
This is craziness

A VOICE
No Son theyre right

Wishful emerges from the crowd

MUMBLE
You too pa

WISHFUL
Truth is Im the cause of it I dropped
the egg I made you how you are If only

dark side

MUMBLE
No Dad No What have they done to you

WISHFUL

forgiveness

MUMBLE

MUMBLE walks away The community part to let him go Ella
chases after him

ELLA
Wait Mumble

Catching up with him

MUMBLE
Its no use Ella I cant live with that

ELLA
Can you live without it

He stops

ELLA (CONTD)
I believe in you Mumble But without the
huddle we cant make an egg Without the
egg what are we here for

ADELIES
True
Thats a big question
MUMBLE
Guys Can Me and Ella be alone for a bit

The Adelies give them space

MUMBLE (CONTD)
OK Heres what Im going to do Im

whats causing the shortage

ELLA
But what about

MUMBLE
Its the only way Youre right Unless
we have food theres no future for any of

us - you me the adelies anyone
ELLA
But
MUMBLE
Give me a year just until the next great
gathering If I dont make it back at

least I tried

ELLA
But

MUMBLE
Now go back I love you Go

Ella returns to the community As she does so CARUSO begins
to CHANT the Gathering answers

CARUSO
Together we stand

ALL
Divided we freeze

ALL (CONTD)
Recite the Wisdoms

ALL (CONTD)
In the Wisdoms we trust
CARUSO
When all others leave

ALL
We Remain

CARUSO
Louder More fervent bretheren
When the Sun vanishes

ALL
We Remain

ELLAS watches through tears as the tiny figures of Mumble and
the Adelies dwindle to specks and disappear into the mist

THE ICE SHELF

Mumble and the Adelies have put the colony far behind
trekking homewards

ADELIELAND

ADELIES
Tell me again where were going

MUMBLE
To find the mystic beings

ADELIES
How do we know where they live

MUMBLE
Well ask Loveday Hes been there

Most of the Adelies are sitting on nests The Adeleies and
Mumble trek past them a protective mother takes a peck at

them

MOTHER
Not so close We got babies on board

ADELIES
-Wow Does nesting make em touchy

They find LOVEDAY at the back of what is left of his PEBBLE
PILE He sits leaning against itexhausted
THE ADELIES
LOVEDAY you okay
what happened
Too much boom-boom for one penguin

MUMBLE kicks a bunch of pebbles at him

MUMBLE
Just one question And I want a straight
answer Where do I find the Mystic
Beings

LOVEDAY tries to raise himself up A tight low gurgling
rumbles from his throat

AN ADELIE
Why dont he speak

LOVEDAY gurgles and points wildly to the SIX-PACK PLASTIC
round his neck

AN ADELIE (CONTD)
Talismansounds like Talisman

LOVEDAY coughs His eyes bulge

ADELIES
Hes possessed
-Its a seizure

MUMBLE
No Hes choking The Talismans gotten
way too tight

THE ADELIES
-Why din you say so
Hold on we gonna take it off
-You pull that side I pull this side

They tug at the SIX-PACK PLASTIC LOVEDAY GASPS AND WINCES

MUMBLE
Stop Youre hurting him

The Adelies back off

AN ADELIE
Any better

LOVEDAY gives a little ‘so-so gesture with his flipper

THE ADELIES
It not gonna come off
Of course its not Its sacred

MUMBLE
LOVEDAY where did you get it

THE ADELIES
It was bestowed on him
By the Mystic Beings

LOVEDAY shakes his head sadly

MUMBLE
They didnt bestow it on you

THE ADELIES
»Poor Guy
-He dont know what hes saying

MUMBLE
If it wasnt bestowed what happened

LOVEDAY mimes swimming

THE ADELIES
-Oh this ones easy
-He swam
On his Hectic Journey of Delightenment
-To the Forbidding Shore

And then

LOVEDAY mimes the talisman going over his head

AN ADELIE
-Well to me thats gotta be bestowing

LOVEDAY shakes his head “no He stretches his neck
MUMBLE

You looked up and It just got caught
around your neck

ADELIES
No way No Hes the revered one
He speaking symbolically

LOVEDAY hangs his head A TEAR slides down his beak

MUMBLE
(gently)
Loveday did you ever meet a Mystic
Being Really

Beaten LOVEDAY shakes his head “No The Adelies are stunned
into silence

MUMBLE (CONTD)
But this thing was made by someone And
if we find them they could take it off
LOVEDAY looks up a glimmer of hope in his eye

MUMBLE (CONTD)
So where do we Go Loveday

Loveday Then he makes a strange Oi Oi Oi sound
AN ADELIE
Oh my Now he thinks hes an Elephant
Seal
LOVEDAY nods and points towards the mountains
AN ADELIE (CONTD)
He wants to go to the top of the
mountain
LOVEDAY shakes his head
MUMBLE
The forbidden place is over the
mountains

LOVEDAY nods

MUMBLE (CONTD)
In the land of the Elephant Seals

LOVEDAY gestures wildly with his flippers

MUMBLE (CONTD)
Beyond the land of the Elephant Seals

LOVEDAY nods “YES and falls back in exhaustion

MUMBLE (CONTD)
So whos coming

LOVEDAY
OL

A MOUNTAIN RIDGE

The Adelies labour uphill into the wind LOVEDAY is lagging
behind breathing hard

Even MUMBLE and the AMIGOS are puffing with the effort of the
climb

Music Over He aint heavy hes my brother

ADELIES
Stop Enough We mustve gone past it
Past Dont kid me Were not even
close

Then on the wind comes a fiant “Oi Oi Oi

MUMBLE
Hear that

As they crest the peak sure enough down below the LAND of
the ELEPHANT SEALS Thousands of them

THE ADELIES
Refresh my memory do elephant seals eat
penguin
No nojus krill and fish
Sure of your facts are you

Not waiting Mumble launches himself over the other side

slip-sliding down the mountain One by one the ADELIES
follow

ADELIES
Well I guess were about to find out

THE LAND OF THE ELEPHANT SEALS
The beach is literally heaving

MUMBLE and the ADELIES come tumbling and sliding right up to
two HUGE SEALS

ELEPHANT SEAL 1
(big-bellied booming southern
voice)
Well roll me over and call me a dugong
What the heck have we got here

The Adelies bunch up behind Mumble

MUMBLE
Excuse me we need directionsto the
Forbidden Shore

MUMBLE
Were looking for the Mystic Beings

ELEPHANT SEAL 2
Mystic Who

MUMBLE
Aliens the ones who made this

He indicates the SIX-PACK PLASTIC around LOVEDAYS neck

SEAL 1 lowers its massive head down to face LOVEDAY
Wheezing he examines the plastic with first with one eye
then the other before announcing his verdict

ELEPHANT SEAL 1
Blizzard Walkers
Cut you up soon as look at you

ELEPHANT SEAL 2
Cut you up before they look at you

MUMBLE

ELEPHANT SEAL 1

They start fighting lunging and flopping on each other

MUMBLE
Come on Loveday lets go

ADELIES
(running to catch up)
Go where
didnt you hear what he said
Its Forbidden

MUMBLE
They dont know Theyve never been there

AN ADELIE
Stop Im hearing voices The mystical
guys They say
Your life is perfectly good as it
isforget this stupid mission

MUMBLE and LOVEDAY keep trekking

ANOTHER ADELIE
Ramon That was embarrassing man

And reluctantly he trails after them As do

THE OTHER ADELIES
-Oh no don do this to us
-Im a lover not a fighter
The first sign of Popsicles or funfood
of any kind I turn round and go back

THE BLIZZARD COUNTRY

MUMBLE LOVEDAY and the ADELIES are tiny specks struggling

over a series of great ridges
MUMBLE

So we walked and walked and kept
walking Over the hills and into Blizzard
country

A SNOW STORM breakes over them A screaming wind brings total
WHITE-OUT The Penguins have to shout to make themselves
heard

THE ADELIES
Oh man This is no place for a penguin
We should be migrating out to sea by
now

MUMBLE
We need to huddle

THE ADELIES
Huddle

MUMBLE
Form a moving circle Share the cold
share the warmth

He turns his back to the wind Immediately the Adelies form a
STRAIGHT LINE down-wind from him

THE ADELIES
Oh yeah nice
Thats definitely better
Good call big guy

MUMBLE
I said a circle

They form a little huddle but as soon as Mumble moves from
the upwind position the Adelies complain

AN ADELIE
No no This cant be right
It was better the other way

They scurry back into a straight line behind Mumble who cops
the FULL BLAST of the GALE

He gives up and marches off into the driving snow

THE ADELIES
Hey
What happened to the Huddle

MUMBLE
(shouts back)
Just keep moving Toboggan if you have
tol

The others lie down propelling themselves forwards on their
fronts

THE ADELIES
-Oh no now I got chest pain
tell you this is a good way to get
snow blind

(MORE)

THE ADELIES (CONTD)
jJust keep moving or youll get my beak
up your butt

FLARE OUT TO WHITE
The blizzard has passed An eerie stillness

One by one the Adelies get to their feet and waddle forwards
to where Mumble and Loveday stand gazing into the distance

They have finally reached the sea again

MUMBLE
You think this is it The Forbidden
Shore

LOVEDAY chokes out a ‘yes’
ADELIES

The way I feel the frostbitten

shore

SoO what are those black things
Close to the waters edge the outline of several buildings
AN ABANDONED WHALING STATION
The PENGUINS venture through it dwarfed by the old flensing-

sheds the chimneys and boiling-vats Its all now abandoned
and half concealed by snow
Around and above them there are HOOKS CHAINS rusting
twisted METALWORK

MUMBLE
Hello Is there anyone out there

An ominous GROANING as some rusting metal plate moves in the
wind

MUMBLE (CONTD)
Hello

THE ADELIES
-No need to shout
Yeah somebody might hear you
I think we seen all there is to see
round here

LOVEDAY is looking at something at his feet

MUMBLE
What is it

There imbedded in the ice another six pack holder
THE SEA ICE

Mumble and the Adelies venture out onto the weak ice beyond
the whaling station finding more and more of the strange
artefacts a piece of nylon rope a soda can a boot

MUMBLE
They must be here somewhere
They wouldnt leave all this stuff lying
around

AN ADELIE
Maybe they invisible

FURTHER ON

Theyve reached the edge of the sea-ice LOVEDAY croaks a
warning He points out to sea

AN ADELIE
What is that

A WAVE has appeared on the glassy surface of the sea It is
coming towards them FAST like the bow wave of an IMMENSE
UNDERWATER CREATURE

MUMBLE
A whale

AN ADELIE
As long as its a good whale not the
other kind

The wave is coming CLOSER

ANOTHER ADELIE
What other kind

A massive BLACK DORSAL FIN breaks the surface

MUMBLE
The ones with teeth

The PENGUINS are off and running

The DORSAL FIN keeps coming like the blade of a demonic
carving knife

Then the monstrous fin disappears and KABOOM The killer
whale breaches the ice AHEAD of them cutting off their
retreat

They are left stranded on a free-floating ICE FLOE

THE ADELIES
dump
Swim for it

MUMBLE
No Stay on the ice pad where its safe

The little floe is wobbling crazily

THE ADELIES
You call this safe amigo
Maybe we should split up
You split up Im staying right here

The KILLER WHALE breaches again rising like a tower block
out of the ocean
THE ADELIES (CONTD)
Woooaaaahhh

The ICE PAD flips flinging them into the water like a
handful of peanuts

IN THE SEA

The PENGUINS head for shore swimming for their lives
LOVEDAY thrashing and wheezing is unable to keep up

MUMBLE
(stops)
LOVEDAY LOVEDAY

He swims back The KILLER WHALE is about to take them both in
one bite MUMBLE pulls LOVEDAY aside but hes not quite
quick enough one of the Whales outer teeth catches LOVEDAY
by the SIX-PACK PLASTIC and he is DRAGGED AWAY tethered to
the KILLER WHALE like Captain Ahab

The WHALE thrashes around wildly trying to dislodge the
hapless little penguin until

LOVEDAY is FLUNG high high into the air andSPLASHES DOWN
some distance away

The KILLER WHALE is left with the SIX-PACK PLASTIC lodged in
its teeth

ICE SHELF
MUMBLE and LOVEDAY scramble onto the ice exhausted

Wondering where the next attack will come from the AMIGOS
huddle nearby

Suddenly the ICE SHELF CRACKS OPEN and the KILLER WHALE soars
right over the top of them

It hits the water but does not stop just keeps going right
on out to sea The Penguins have no time to reflect on their
good fortune

Theres an EARTH SHATTERING NOISE behind them Turning they
see a vast BLACK SHAPE a hundred feet high coming at them
through the fog

The ADELIES flee across the ice MUMBLE stands transfixed by
the BIG BLACK SHIP towering above him On the deck he sees
HUMAN FIGURES

MUMBLE
Aliens

The pack-ice is BUCKLING AND EXPLODING ahead of the GREAT
JUGGERNAUT

MUMBLE (CONTD)
Stop Please

From a safe distance the ADELIES stop and look on in
amazement as Mumble stands his ground shouting up at THE
SHIP as it advances towards him

MUMBLE (CONTD)
Its very important

The ICE beneath his feet OPENS UP Mumble topples into the
gap and The SHIP PASSES OVER HIM huge propellers churning
leaving a channel ninety feet wide

MUMBLE resurfaces

MUMBLE (CONTD)
WEHAVETOTALK

He chases after the ship THE ADELIES chase after Mumble

THE ADELIES
AMIGO-0-0-0 LET IT GO-0-0-0-O

Already the ship is half a mile away
THE ICEBERG

Beyond the last of the ice floes is THE WORLDS TALLEST
ICEBERG MUMBLE hurls himself onto it and starts scrambling
up its precipitous sides THE ADELIES follow struggling to
keep up

THE SUMMIT
MUMBLEs POV THE BIG BLACK SHIP has joined TWO OTHERS about
a mile away The Adelies join him

THE ADELIES
You found them you found Aliens
Now we go back tell everybody whos
taking the fish

Mumbles eyes remain fixed on the horizon

THE ADELIES (CONTD)
Dont feel bad Tall Guy
They were just too fast Too big
Too everything

MUMBLE
Theyve stopped

LOVEDAY
Mumble I owe you my life amigo And I
say this because I
admire and deeply respect you If you are
thinking what I think
you are thinking You are out of your
crazy head

MUMBLE
Say Hi to Ella for me

ADELIES
You say Hi Come back and say Hi to her
yourself

Mumble turns takes a few paces back

MUMBLE
Oh One other thing You guys

ADELIES
What

Suddenly MUMBLE turns to the precipice and runs as fast as
he can
MUMBLE
Excelsi yah

As he launches himself into space
WIDE SHOT
The tiny penguin soaring off the top of the ICEBERG

THE ADELIES rush to the edge as far below Mumble HITS THE
WATER And vanishes

THE ADELIES
»can you believe that
brought us all this way and killed
himself
-no he didnt look

Far out he has surfaced and is swimming strongly in direction
of the BIG BLACK SHIP

THE ADELIES (CONTD)
A dive like that and still he lives
Yeah like when he did his Happy Feet
his feet had wings
A normal penguin could never have done
it

LOVEDAY
You dont think we should go with him

ADELIES
-Dont sweat it Revered One Many are
called few are chosen
(MORE)

ADELIES (CONTD)
-Hey how tall you think the Tall Guy
was
Who could say Four times my height at
least

Loveday follows behind

LOVEDAY
About this Revered One stuff you guys

AN ADELIE
Yeah
LOVEDAY
Maybe just call me Pedro

THE OPEN SEA

MUMBLE PLOUGHS THROUGH a rolling sea towering waves block
everything from view but on the crests he catches sight of

THREE BLACK SHIPS far ahead but stationary as if waiting
for him

LATER

Hes getting closer The ships are only half a mile away when
Something rises from the deep threatening to engulf him a
HUGE NET TEEMING WITH FISH

Mumble shoots out of the way just avoiding being caught as

UP AHEAD The great NET FULL OF FISH breaks the surface of the
water and is winched on board

MUMBLE
(yells)
HEY YOU CANT DO THAT
WHAT ABOUT US
THE SCARCITY THE SCARCITY

As if in response the ships ENGINES START UP again and the
sea around him erupts in churning foam

Swamped by the wake Mumble goes under When he resurfaces
THE SHIP is already on its way

MUMBLE (CONTD)
HEY YOU THINK YOURE GONNA GET AWAY WITH

THIS NOT IF I CAN HELP IT YOU SHIT-
SQUIRTER ALIEN CREEPS

He takes a deep breath and resumes his pursuit
OPEN OCEAN

The SEAS are MOUNTAINOUS There is no sign of the ship now
nor of land
MUMBLE swims up the side of each wave over its foaming crest
and down into the deep dark valley below

LATER

The air is full of spray Choking MUMBLE ducks under the
water

UNDERWATER

Its peaceful here Then something moves beside him and turns
with a start to see A MASSIVE EYE

A BLUE WHALE entirely fills his field of vision It sings a
few booming Wagnerian notes Its voice is almost deafening

MUMBLE
Too loud

He surfaces spluttering

MUMBLE (CONTD)
Too loud

A VOICE calls to him from above Mumble looks up An
ALBATROSS hovers overhead

ALBATROSS
Hes looking for a mate mate And these
days I tell you theyre few and far
between

From the ALBATROSS aerial view Mumble looks tiny next to
the MASSIVE BULK of the Blue Whale

ALBATROSS (CONTD)
Talking of which I never seen a penguin
this far out Watch you dont hit The
Convergence mate

MUMBLE
The Convergence

ALBATROSS
Where the cold water meets the warm
mate Once you cross it theres no
getting back What you tryinmg to prove
anyway

MUMBLE
Im trying to talk to the Aliens

ALBATROSS
The who
MUMBLE
On the black iceberg The ones taking all
the fish
ALBATROSS

hem Fish is just the start of it Mate
hem aliens is the ones who took out the
whales

MUMBLE
hey kill whales Thats impossible

ALBATROSS
Straight up mate Biggest creatures ever
lived Decimated mate

MUMBLE
So if I wanted to talk to them where
would I go

ALBATROSS
Anywhere and everywhere Over the sea
under the sea Jees Ive even seen them
fly The great southlands swarming with
em

MUMBLE
Wheres that Do you think the Whale
would take me there

The Blue Whale responds with a long mournful NO-O-O-O which
the Albatross does not need to translate

ALBATROSS
No way mate he wont go anywhere near
“em And neither should you
Mumble hesitates bobbing on the water weighing the
warnings

He makes up his mind and strikes out again swimming towards
the convergence

The Albatross hovering on the wing watches

ALBATROSS (CONTD)
Dont say I didnt warn you

The ALBATROSS wheels away

As MUMBLE fights on through the huge choppy waves the
Whales Wagnerian song booms out EERIE and FORLORN

THE CONVERGENCE

We see from above the BLUE WHALE turning as well changing
course to avoid a change in the texture and colour of the
water stretching in a line as far as the eye can see MUMBLE
swims RIGHT ACROSS THE LINE

A VAST OCEAN

MUMBLE is a mere DOT now as the GREAT CURRENTS capture him
and sweep him away

We pull back through the clouds until the very CURVATURE OF
THE EARTH is visible a blue horizon with no land in sight

SMALL POLLUTED BEACH

On the HIGH-WATER MARK amongst the rubbish and the oil
slick we see what looks like a dead animal It is MUMBLE

A creature in RED GUMBOOTS approaches Its small hand reaches
down and nudges him with a stick MUMBLE moans and the
gumboots RUN AWAY shouting something unintelligible

With great difficulty Mumble raises his head to try to see
more Sunlight flares bleaching to white as he LOSES
CONSCIOUSNESS

A WHITE ROOM

Scientific books and specimens of birds in large bottles on
shelves line the walls
MUMBLE eyes closed is lying on a stainless steel table He
opens his eyes to the brilliant glare of an examination lamp

There is movement around him Voices whispering in an alien
tongue A FIGURE IN WHITE bends over him cleaning the oil
from his feathers with detergent MUMBLE squawks

MUMBLE (VO)
When I finally saw one the Alien was
even more hideous than Id imagined

A very pretty FEMALE SCIENTIST is smiling down at him

MUMBLE (VO) (CONTD)
frontways eyes no feathers Big teeth
with blood around them Strange fleshy
beak A meat eater

MUMBLE (CONTD)
(terrified)
The - fish - are - ours Understand

But all the SCIENTIST sees is a squawking penguin

MUMBLE (CONTD)
We cant live without them

The SCIENTIST produces a syringe and squirts some of its
contents in the air

MUMBLE (CONTD)
Speak Adelie Skua-talk

Another SCIENTIST holds him still while the needle is
administered

MUMBLE (CONTD)
Oh no Not the pointy thing

Drowsy now he is eased into a PADDED CAGE The SCIENTISTS
close the lid and secure it with straps

IN THE CARGO HOLD
We hear a feeble thumping from inside

Pull back to reveal Mumbles box on a shelf among crates and
luggage Fade in engine noise over as
ENDLESS SKY

A 747 drones across the screen eastwards into the night
DARKNESS

MUMBLE
I woke in darkness Unable to move Was I
dead And if I was dead where was that
light coming from

Like the light at the end of a tunnel As if in a dream
MUMBLE ambles towards it Emerging into

PENGUIN HEAVEN
Bright BLUE SKY sparkling WHITE CLIFFS OF ICE

MUMBLE
Wow They brought me home

His voice ECHOES back at him with a mocking edge There is
something unusual about this place A plump penguin waddles
by

MUMBLE (CONTD)
Excuse me where are we

PENGUIN
Heaven Where dyou think

MUMBLE
Oh So were dead Right

PENGUIN
Dunno Dont care We got food We got
water You hear a seal now and then but
you never meet one Perfect

Mumble is looking around trying to figure it out

PENGUIN (CONTD)
Fish

MUMBLE
Where

A fish hits him on the head

A moment later hes knocked flat by a sudden rush of
PENGUINS Chinstraps Rock-hoppers Adelies King penguins
emerging from holes in the rock face

PENGUINS
Fish time Fish time

Lying on his back he sees fish tumble from the sky Its
RAINING FISH

MUMBLE (VO)
Every day after that it rained fish in
the afternoon

His POV Load after load of fish tumbling out of a clear sky

UNDERWATER
Fish hit the surface and sink

MUMBLE (VO)
Fish on land and fish underwater

Mumble pursues one of them

MUMBLE
Sometime you got a live one but there was
nowhere really to chase it

He swims SLAP BANG into a sheet of thick glass ALIEN FACES
are pressed against it Mumble yells and shoots to the
surface

THE PENGUIN ENCLOSURE

High up he sees the viewing gallery A great CROWD of ALIENS
staring and chattering

MUMBLE (VO)
Aliens everywhere watching you eat
watching you sleep

Mumble backs away and knocks into the PAINTED HORIZON He
puts out a wing to steady himself and notices a metal tag on
it This place is beginning to upset him

MUMBLE
(yells at the aliens)
What have you done to my wing This is
not my home I want to get out of here

The other penguins stand around immobile chomping fish

OLD TIMER PENGUIN
Guess hes new here

THE PENGUIN ENCLOSURE
Caption A year later

Specators POV Mumble stands around like the others
ignoring the aliens chomping fish

His POV Day after day the view constantly the same except
for the groupings of spectators high in the viewing Gallery

MUMBLE (VO)
After a while you learn to stop fighting
it Stop protesting take the knocks

CU Mumble A camera flashes A fish hits him he doesnt
flinch

MUMBLE (VO)
jJust take what comes and live inside
your mind

THE SAME PASSAGE OF TIME

Another day and another Night follows day follows night
Spectators come and go The penguins stand like statues

Though bubbles begin to appear above Mumbles head snapshots
of his past experiences

MUMBLE (VO)
Sometimes I thought about dad and mum
Sometimes the Amigos and others Id met
along the way But mostly I thought about
Ella wondering who she ended up with
Whether she had enough food to eat
whether she still remembered our song

In the though bubble Ella has appeared singing never can say
goodbye Mumbles feet begin shuffling to the rythm

SPECTATORS GALLERY

Most of the specators are leaving but one young girls stops
and stares

YOUNG GIRL
Look Mommy Its dancing

She bangs on the glass in her excitement
PENGUIN ENCLOSURE

Mumble woken from his reverie looks up and sees her looking
at him

MUMBLE
What What did I do

The little girl who is pointing at mumbles feet Mumble looks
down realizes what his feet are doing looks up again

MUMBLE (CONTD)
You like that Well how about this

He does a more elaborate step The Mother shouts in
disbelief Various other specators come back and join her

Mumbles fellow captives are unimpressed

PENGUIN 1
Oh-Oh another one gone troppo

PENGUIN 2
You think its infectious

PENGUIN 3
I sure hope not

They shuffle away
IN THE SPECTATORS GALLERY

The aliens in contrast are loving it Already a crowd has
gathered laughing and clapping

NEXT DAY

The Gallery is packed Mumble keeps dancing

NEXT DAY

Theres a riot going on up there People fighting to get a
view Newspaper reporters TV cameras

The other penguins in the enclosure have moved back giving
Mumble more space Every specattor is focussed on him Mumble
is focussed on the spectators

MUMBLE (VO
Yes Yes At last something was
happening I was finally getting through
to them

THE TRANSPORTER BOX

A squawking Mumble is thrust inside and the lid slams shut on
him Kerchunk

THE EMPEROR COLONY

Silence then across the vast expanse a TINY FIGURE appears
on the horizon

PENGUIN vOS
Whats that
Where
»Coming from the Inland

A couple of Penguins watch the approaching figure

PENGUINS
Is it a Penguin
-Is it one of ours

LATER

Mumble approaches the two sentries The colony is much
diminished only small groups scattered here and there

MUMBLE
Hi where is everybody

PENGUINS
Who wants to know

MUMBLE
I used to live here Whens the Great
Gathering

PENGUINS
This is it I guess

MUMBLE
This is all thats left

Other penguins are gathering to scrutinise the stranger

PENGUINS
So Whos this
-Kinda small for an emperor
(suspicious) Where did you say you were
from

Then a female penguin bursts out of the crowd

ELLA
Mumble Its Mumble

MUMBLE
Ella Is it you You havent changed a
bit

As he speaks his eyes are drawn to the huge number of FLUFFY
CHICKS following behind her

MUMBLE (CONTD)
Are these all yours

ELLA
Theyre my singing students

MUMBLE
So You never

ELLA
Of course not I was waiting for you

MUMBLE
But thats fantastic Ive got so much to
tell you - to tell everyone
(To the gathering crowd)
I found out whos been causing the
Scarcity

ELLA
Huh

MUMBLE
I know whos been taking our fish
I made contact with Aliens
Theyre coming here Right behind me
Listen

They listen Above the wind faint electronic BEEPING SOUND

PENGUINS
Whos doing all the shouting
Its Mumble Hes worse than before

MUMBLE
No honestly Aliens will be here soon
You have to believe me We came in a big
hollow bird and they landed on the ice
and

CARUSO bursts through the crowd

CARUSO
You again And still full of the same old
nonsense

MUMBLE

But its true

The BEEP is quite audible now - a little faster and louder
Curious Ella ambles round behind mumble tro see whats
making the noise

CARUSO
Move along everyone Pay no attention
Theres no such thing as aliens

ELLA
So who fixed him up with this

She turns him around to reveal some kind of circuit board
glued to his back a small aerial winking red lights A
TRANSMITTER

A gasp of fear and astonishment from the penguins Caruso is
momentarily speechless

PENGUINS
--Does it hurt
-Its not made of feathers thats for
sure
whats it gonna do

MUMBLE
Its so they can find me
(cocks an ear)
Thats them now Listen

A distant rumbling like some monstrous cataclysm is
approaching

CARUSO
You led them here Are you crazy

MUMBLE
You said they didnt exist

CARUSO
Theyll slaughter us Head for the sea

MUMBLE
No Do this Do Happy feet

He starts tap dancing The penguins are torn between
Carusos instructions and Mumbles

MUMBLES
Its what they understand They cant
talk they cant sing They speak with
their feet Do it

A few adventurous souls begin to copy him out of fear if
nothing else

As they do so the sky begins to darken A strange whirling
wind starts whipping the snow around them The very earth
seems to be shaking under them

CARUSO
Now look what youve done

PENGUINS
its the end of the world
-Its all Mumbles fault I told you
Wishful rounds on them angrily

WISHFUL
Just do what the kid says

They start dancing

Caruso has climbed a small hillock and is ranting like an old
testament prophet

CARUSO
Recite the wisdoms
Together we stand
Divided We Freeze

Mumble and Ella are dancing through the community

MUMBLE
Come on everyone Happy Feet Its our
only chance

CARUSO
When all others leave we Remain

MUMBLE
FEET

CARUSO
CHANT

MUMBLE

FEET FEET HAPPY FEET
The tide is beginning to turn in his favour

MUMBLE (CONTD)
Thats it Excellent jRiba Riba
penguinos
Shake those hips Come on bust a move

CARUSO
Adhere to the wisdoms The Ancients will
protect us
As he shouts his he is blown off his feet by a tremendous
gust of wind

Caruso tumbles head over heels as a massive Chinook
helicopter rises over the hirizon its massive rotors mashing
the air

It swoops down over the penguin nation and lands a little
distance away

Music Over Wanna Dance with Somebody

Now the entire emperor community are dancing for all they are
worth

PENGUINS
-Aliens
I never doubted it for a moment

Mrs Astrakhan dances past

MRS ASTRAKHAN
More feelink BE SPONTANUOUS

Wishful dances over to her his eyes on Mumble and Ella

WISHFUL
(dancing)
You know who that is Thats my boy

MRS ASTRAKHAN
(dancing)
Know him He ees my star pupol
I TEACH HIM EVERYTHINGK
BY THE CHINOOK
HUMAN scientists disembark Skidoos are kicked into life

We TRAVEL WITH THE SKIDOOS across the ICE-SHELF to the colony

Scientists POV As they stop lower their hoods and gaze in
astonishment One of them lifts a video cam to record

THOUSANDS OF EMPEROR PENGUIN DANCING WITH PURE ABANDONED
JOY
MUMBLE (VO)
From that day on No one quite knows how
it happened but the black icebergs began
to disappear and the fish became abundant
once more

A CONFERENCE ROOM

Suited figures are seated round a large table watching as
IMAGES of the DANCING PENGUIN COLONY play on a video screen

Without the music its less obviously a dance

CHAIRMAN
SO what do you reckon

EXPERT
Yes quite extraordinary (stares at the
screen) some kind of neurological
disorder a nutritional deficiency
perhaps Wed certainly back the
long-term study

CHAIRMAN
And the international treaty

DELEGATE1
Yes This is exactly the leverage we need
for an embargo No fishing
whatsoeverlegal illegal sanctioned
whatever

DELEGATE2
So we all step up policing of the pirate
factory ships And we pressure that
country to stop their so-called
“experimental fishing

DELEGATE3
Yes if our government asks your
government to approach their government
to call off their fleet

DELEGATE2
Better if their government hear it from
our government via your government
CHAIRMAN
What the heck The amount of publicity
this is generating theyd have world war
three if they didnt stop

THE COLONY

In the confusion of penguins we find MUMBLE ELLA and their
chick

MUMBLE (VO)
Ellas gave up teaching to look after our
chick We take turns looking after her
and going to get the fish

As we watch Ella moves off joining the great to and fro of
penguins along the highway to the sea

MUMBLE covers his chick protectively watrching his wife walk
away

MUMBLE (VO)
I worry about her sure Theres so much
big stuff out there it can be kind of
frightening

We are pulling back now back from the colony back from
Antarctica

MUMBLE (VO)
But the way I see it Theres so much out
there we dont understand

SPACE

Still pulling back

the stuff you think is small stuff
could actually be the big stuff

Keep pulling back from the world the solar system the
galaxy

MUMBLE (V0
Or am I not making sense here
Further back Our galaxy is framed in something like a bomb-
sight

VOICE1
Is there a problem I thought this one
was barren

IN THE DOME

Were somewhere otherworldly inside a clear dome the size of
a stadium with a view of the heavens In the centre of this
space always just out of shot two illdefined figures are
talking subtitled

VOICE2
More or less But one of the stars were
harvesting supports these things here

Projected somehow in mid-air A 3-D image of Times square in
winter with tiny people milling around in black coats

VOICE1
VOICE2
Well Exactly But what we didnt know
about before was these things here
An image of the dancing penguins appears
VOICE2 (CONTD)
Just thought youd want to see them

beforeyou know

The shadowy figure laughs enjoying the image

VOICE1
Hmm Charming
VOICE2
So We go ahead Or
VOICE1

No Better leave them be See what
sector twelves got to offer instead
The bomb sight moves away from our galaxy to another part of
the universe

With that the two figures head off across the great shadowy
interior

The projector beam catches them briefly throwing up the
giant shadows of these aliens They look very like huge

penguins

As they walking solemnly out of shot with their hands behind
their backs one of them breaks step to do a little jig

RUN TITLES

THE END
