and therein lies our first challenge
for Rohan is weak and ready to fall
The king’s mind is enslaved it’s an
old device of Saruman’s His hold over
King Théoden is now very strong Sauron
and Saruman are tightening the noose
But for all their cunning we have one
advantage

FRODO
What

SAM
I wonder if people will ever say
“Let’s hear about Frodo and the Ring”
And they’1ll say “Yes that’s one of my
favorite stories Frodo was really
courageous wasn’t he dad” “Yes my
boy the most famousest of Hobbits And
that’s saying a lot”

FRODO laughs and turns to SAM

FRODO
Well you’ve left out one of the chief
characters “Samwise the Brave” I

want to hear more about Sam

FRODO turns to SAM SAM smiles sheepishly FRODO’S smile
He stops and turns to SAM seriously

FRODO
Frodo wouldn’t have got far without
Sam

SAM

Now Mr Frodo you shouldn’t make fun
I was being serious

FRODO
(smiling)
So was I

FRODO walks onward

SMEAGOL runs and hides behind a tree

SMEAGOL
But the fat Hobbit he knows Eyes

GOLLUM peeks out from behind the other side of the tree

GOLLUM
Then we stabs them out Put out his

SMEAGOL nods eagerly
