INT MELANIES BEAHC APARTMENT - NIGHT

The Black Voice belong to forty-five-year old ORDELL
ROBBIE

Ordell wears clothes nice and likes wearing nice clothes
Stylish athletic wear (Reebok) heavy black leather
jackets (Hugo Boss) warm-colored berets and baseball
caps to cover his balding head are Ordells look At
this moment Ordells wearing an open silk shirt

Ordell narrates the video playing on the big-screen V
(the most expensive thing in the apartment) He holds a
cocktail in one hand (screwdriver his drink of choice)
and the remote control in the other pacing the floor in
his I-can-talk-anybody-into-anything voice

LOUIS GARA who looks like he does his shopping at the
Salvation Army (dressed in a Hawaiian shirt and
dungarees) sits on the sofa staring blankly at the
video drinking Jack Daniels on ice Louis white also
in his mid forties has lived over half of his life in
penal institutions The experience has affected both his
body language and his thought process

While acutely aware of the rhythm of life inside a
correction facility in the real world his timing is
thrown Its like a song he doesnt know the lyrics to
but attempt to sing anyway

e third person watching the video is the person who
ives in this apartment MELANIE RALSTON Melanie thirty-
ree is a tanned blonde California beach bunny Like
e kind you se in the old Crown International movies
rom the seventies like Pom Pom Girls Malibu Beach
nd Beach Girls except Melanie is older than any of
ose girls ever are Shes dressed in her Melanie-
uniform of stringy Levis cutoffs and a stringy bra top
So far Melanie has been able to make a living out of
lying in the sun always finding a generous wealthy man
more than willing to pay her rent and pick up her tabs
In her prime (twenty two) it was Japanese industrialists
film production guys and Middle Eastern businessmen who
kept Melanie And it was places like the Bahamas
Acapulco and the Virgin Islands where they kept her

tome tey

But now at thirty three she lives in an apartment in
Hermosa Beach California that Ordell pays for an drops
in and out of Shes curled up in a reclining chair
smoking weed from a pipe reading Movieline Magazine and
paying no attention to the video

ORDELL
This TEC-9 They advertise it as
being the most popular gun in
American crime Can you believe that
shit It actually says that on the
little booklet that comes with it
Most Popular Gun in American Crime
like theyre proud of that shit

Ordell hits the fast-forward on his remote control

Sidney is rushed off the screen and replace by CINDY a
pretty blonde bodybuilder clad in a red white and blue
bikini holding a Styer Aug

ORDELL (CONTD)

Check out this body-builder chick
Now see what she got Thats a Styer
aug Styer Augs a bad motherfucker

Ordell punches up the volume

Cindy BLASTS the Styer Aug loud
Ordell imitates the sound of the weapon

ORDELL (CONTD)
Shits expensive man Comes from
Austria My customers dont know shit
about it so there aint no demand
(to Melanie)
Baby I could use some more ice

Melanie puts down the magazine takes his cocktail glass
from him and moves to the kitchen

ORDELL (CONTD)

Young plainclothes cop RAY NICOLET enters the scene

NICOLET

purse she says to Ray

JACKIE
I doubt it
(to Dargus)
Whos your friend

DARGUS
This is Special Agent Ray Nicolet
with Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms
Would you mind if we looked in that
bag

Jackie lights her cigarette with a yellow Bic lighter

JACKIE
Would I mind Do I have a choice

DARGUS
You have the right to say no And I
have the right to make you wait here
with Ray while I go get a warrant
And if I dont want to go through all
that trouble I could just take you
in on suspicion

JACKIE
Suspicion of what

NICOLET
All he wants to do is peek in your
bag Ill watch he doesnt take
anything
Jackie shrugs and says

JACKIE
Go ahead

Dargus lays the flight bag on the pavement gets down on
his haunches and starts feeling through her things

Dargus smiles
DARGUS

You could get a two hundred and fifty
thousand dollar fine plus two years
in prison Now you want to talk to us
about it or you want to talk to
Customs

JACKIE

NICOLET
Listen Jackie Hope you dont mind

kinda hard to get along with Now do

Nicolet laughs 0OS

DARGUS (0S)

Substantial Assistance Agreement

cooperate Tell us who gave you the
money and who youre giving it to

Jackie doesnt sat anything she just smokes

NICOLET (0S)
You got a good lawyer
DARGUS (0S)
Can she afford a good one is the
question Otherwise shell be in
Sybill Brand three weeks easy before
the Public Defender gets around to
her

NICOLET (0S)
Ever heard of a fella named Beaumont
Livingston

Not a word

NICOLET (0S) (CONTD)
Dont know Beaumont Thats funny
cause Beaumont knows you Well he
did know you Beaumont was found in
the trunk of a car - dead Shot
twice Once in the head and once in
the chest

Jackie she puts the ool in cool

NICOLET (0S) (CONTD)
I had the chance to talk to Beaumont
yesterday You see like you
Beaumont found himself in some hot
water He was looking at ten years he
was pretty sure he didnt want to do
and was understandably concerned Now
maybe you dont know Beaumont but
Beaumont knew you and maybe so does
the guy who blew Beaumonts head off

Not a word
DARGUS (0S)
If you dont want to talk to us I
guess well just have to hand you
over to Customs

Jackie puts out her cigarette

JACKIE
Okay lets go

She stares down the cops

DARGUS AND NICOLET

We cut to the detective and the special agent for the
first time in the scene

DARGUS
You know Miss Brown theres
basically three types of people that
we come along in the performance of
our duty One is INNOCENT PEOPLE
Victims witnesses innocent
bystanders You aint any of these
Then theres two CRIMINALS These
sonabitches have dedicated their
lives to a life outside the law That
aint you either Where you belong is
the third category The category we
refer to as LOSERS

Jackies eyes dont even narrow at the insult She just
says without expression

JACKIE
Im not a loser

DARGUS

Oh youre both In 1985 you were
flying for TWA and got busted for
carrying drugs You were carrying
them for a pilot husband of yours He
did time and you got off But that
ended your career with the big
airlines Cut to thirteen years
later Youre forty-four years of
age Youre flying for the shittiest
little shuttle-fucking piece of shit
Mexican airline that there is Where
you make a whopping twelve-thousand
dollars a year That aint a hulluva
lot to show for a twenty year career
And to top it off youre going to
jail Now true the judge even with
your prior will probably only give
you a year or two But this doesnt
seem like the time of life you got
years to throw away

(pause)
Now we dont like trying losers like
theyre criminals But in the absence
of a criminal we will try you Now
wasnt this money given to you by an
American living in Mexico by the name
of Cedric Walker

Jackie remains unmoved by this monologue
Nicolet joins back in

NICOLET
You know ol Beaumont wasnt much
for talkin either Yeah he told us
about you and Mr Walker but whoever
the hell it was he worked for out
here he wouldnt say Could it be
the same person you were supposed to
deliver this money to

Jackie just stares at them saying nothing

Dargus sits behind his desk with Jackies flight bag on
it

DARGUS
Id like your permission to open this
again So well know exactly how much
money were talkin about here

Jackie gets up from her chair walks over to the desk
unzips the bag takes out the manila envelope and drops
it on the desk

JACKIE
Help yourself

DARGUS
While youre at it let me see what
else is in there You mind

She reaches in the bag and brings out a pocketbook

JACKIE
My pocketbook

DARGUS
Whats in it

JACKIE
Beauty products

Nicolet takes the manila envelope

NICOLET
Ill count the money

Dargus points at a clear plastic bag with pills and
packets in it

DARGUS
Whats this

JACKIE
Thats my diet shit

Nicolet takes out the bills from the envelope

DARGUS
Lets see what else is in there

Nicolet takes the bills and looks inside the envelope
His expression changes to a shit-eating grin
NICOLET
Oh Miss Brown

JACKIE
Yeah

Nicolet pulls out a clear cellophane sandwich bag with a
half-inch or so of white powder inside

NICOLET
And what would this be Sweet and
Low

JACKIE

What the fuck is that shit

NICOLET
I know what it looks like

JACKIE
You planted that shit on me

Nicolet and Dargus laugh at that

JACKIE
Look that shit aint mine

NICOLET
(to Dargus)
It isnt enough for Trafficking but
how bout Posession with the Intent
to Distribute

DARGUS
Oh I wouldnt be so sure What with
all the cash I think I could go with
Conspiracy to Traffic

JACKIE

NICOLET

sitting at a small table waiting for her to

The Cockatoo Inn is just what Jackie was looking for A

dark and red cocktail lounge in Hawthorne off of

Hawthorne Boulevard by the apartment where the stewardess
lives (about ten minutes from LAX)

The clientele of the Cockatoo is an older

black crowd

and an even older white crowd whod been coming here
years before it became a black bar

A JUKEBOX plays soft old-school RandB

Jackie and Max sit side by side at a small table

a bar candle in a red glass thing

of a time gettin my brand

MAX
Whats your brand

JACKIE

Davidoffs I get em in Mexico
Theyre hard to find here I was
locked up with the last two getting
legal advice from a woman who was in
for bustin her boyfriends head open
with a baseball bat

MAX
Was she helpful

JACKIE
She was more helpful than the fuckin
Public Defender
(she takes a sip of wine)
I dont know - I guess what I need is
a lawyer find out what my options
are

MAX
You know I figured out the other day
Ive written something like fifteen
thousand bonds since Ive been in the
business Id say about eighty
percent of them were at least drug
related If you want I can help you
look at your options

Jackie takes the talk in a different direction

JACKIE
Youre not tired of it

MAX
(smiles)
I am as a matter of fact

A moment of silence between them they both take drinks

MAX (CONTD)
What have they told you

JACKIE
So far Ive been told I can cooperate
and get probation maybe Or I can
stand mute and get as much as five
years Does that sound right

MAX
Id say if youre tried and found
guilty you wont get more than a year
and a day Thats State time Prison

JACKIE
(under her breath)
Shit

MAX
But they wont want to take you to
trial Theyll offer you simple
Possession a few months of County
time and a year or two probation
(pointing to her drink)
How bout another

JACKIE
Sure

Max gestures to an older black cocktail waitress named
ROWEN for two more

MAX
You know who put the dope in your
bag

JACKIE
Yeah but thats not what this was
about They were fuckin waitin for
my ass They knew I had that money
they even knew the amount The one
who searched my bag from LAPD
Dargus hardly even looked at it
Oh Id say theres fifty thousand
here What would you say But all
they could do was threaten me and
hand me over to Customs and I could
tell they didnt want to do that
MAX
They wanted you to tell them what you
know

JACKIE
I had em too I burnt those two
Starky and Hutch motherfuckers down
Then their asses lucked out and found
that coke

MAX
What did they want to know

JACKIE
Who gave me the money and who I was
giving it to And some guy they found
in a trunk with his head blown off
Said it was him who told them bout
me

The Waitress comes with the drinks

ROWEN
Can I get you two some popcorn

MAX
No thanks

Rowen exits

MAX (CONTD)
That would be Beaumont Livingston

JACKIE
Thats him How do you know ‘em

MAX
I wrote him on Monday They found him
dead on Tuesday

JACKIE
Ordell pick up his bond
MAX
Same as you Ten thousand

JACKIE
The federal agent kinda half hinted
Ordell might of done Beaumont

MAX
You mentioned a guy from LAPD
but you didnt mention the Federal

JACKIE
I didnt

MAX
No you didnt What branch

JACKIE
Ray Nicolet with Alcohol Tobacco
and Firearms

Max puts it together

MAX
Hes the one who wants you

JACKIE
It was the other guy who busted me

MAX
Cause if he busted you youd play
hell bonding out of federal court He
doesnt want you mad at him he wants
you to tell him what you know He
uses you to get a line on Ordell
make a case then take him federal
You know what Ordells into

JACKIE
I have a pretty good idea Ordell
aint no bootlegger and I doubt hes
smugglin Cuban cigars So that only
leaves one thing an ATF man would
be interested in

Jackie waits a moment before answering weighs things in
her mind and makes a decision

JACKIE
I used to bring over ten thousand at
a time Thats the legal limit so I
never brought more than that

MAX
How many trips did you make
JACKIE
With ten thousand Nine

MAX
Hes got that kinda money

JACKIE
Its all in lock boxes in a Mexico
bank But hes got a problem Hes -
what do you call it when you got
money but dont have cash

MAX
Cash poor

JACKIE
Thats it Hes cash poor He kept on
me till I finally said okay Ill
bring whatever fits in a nine-by-
twelve envelope I got paid five
hundred dollars and his friend Mr
Walker in Mexico gave me the
envelope

MAX
If you knew bringing anything over
ten thousand was against the law why
not pack a hundred grand

Jackie gets exasperated

JACKIE
Whatever it was had to fit in my bag
and not hit you in the face if the
bag was opened This aint solvin my
problem I gotta figure out a way to
either keep my job or get out of
trouble Im of today but if I cant
leave the country Im out of a job
And if I dont got a job I cant
hire a lawyer

MAX
Ask ATF They might give you
permission

JACKIE
Yeah if I cooperate

She pours the coffee

JACKIE

people Theyre crooks He can try
bringing I in himself but Ordell

Customs line Either he recruits
another Cabo stewardess or he
continues to trust me I made him
feel he still can

Jackie walks to the table with the two coffee mugs and
sits down

definitely the case Theres a lot of

MAX
Bring the money in and they follow
it

JACKIE
Yea but Im going to dress it up
Put the money in a shopping bag and
hand it to someone I meet here

MAX
You dont actually do it that way

JACKIE
He always just picked it up at my
place But with ATF involved I
want to stage it You know make it
look more intriguing like we know
what the fuck were doin Then its
up to Ray Nicolet the AT F guy to
follow the shopping bag

MAX
Make the delivery somewhere in the
mall

JACKIE
Right around here in the food court

MAX
I called you last night

JACKIE
I know I got your message Ray
wanted to have dinner He wanted to
talk about the sting were plotting
Thats what he calls it A sting
Hes being real nice to me

MAX
You think hes got a thing for you

JACKIE
Maybe But Im thinking it might be
something like he wants the money for
himself

MAX
I dont follow your logic What does
his being nice to you have to do with
him wanting Ordells money

JACKIE
Hes setting me up to make a
proposition

MAX
I see

JACKIE
You dont propose something like that
unless youre pretty sure the other
persons into it
MAX
Has he hinted around

JACKIE
Not really But I knew this narcotics
cop one time Told me that in a raid
the whole package never gets back to
the station His exact words

MAX
You know some interesting people

JACKIE
We werent bullshittin either
cause later he was suspended and
forced to retire

MAX
Has Nicolet told you any colorful
stories like that

She shakes her head no

JACKIE
He tries to act cool

MAX

No harm in that Hes a young guy
havin fun being a cop I know the
type trust me on this Hes more
interested in Ordell than the money
If hes gonna do anything suspect
itll be cutting corners to get the
conviction but he wouldnt walk off
with the money Its evidence

JACKIE
What about you Max

MAX
What If I was in Nicolets place

JACKIE
No I mean you right now Not it you
were somebody else

MAX
If I saw a way to walk off with a
shopping bag full of money would I
take it

JACKIE
You know where it came from Its not
like its anybodys life savings It
wouldnt even be missed
MAX
A half-a-million dollars will always
be missed

JACKIE
Youre avoiding the question

MAX
Okay sure I might be tempted
Especially now since Im getting out
of the bail bonds business

Jackie looks at him wow that was a statement but she
doesnt say anything

Max continues

MAX
I have to stand behind all my active
bonds but Im not writing any new
ones

JACKIE

underneath her cool surface Its understandable After
all shes been the architect of this half-a-million
dollars switcheroo Shes moved heaven and earth to make
all the pieces fall into place and all the players thnk
what she wants them to think

As she talks to Max she knows tomorrow all her hard work
will either fail or succeed But dont take this
difference the wrong way This edge Im referring to is
not one born out of fear (Jackies nervous but shes not
afraid) Its more the edge an athlete might feel before
an all-important competition

JACKIE
I told them Ordells changed the
amount hes bringing in

MAX
Do you think they bought it

JACKIE
Oh yeah I got them thinking
Ordells real nervous They love
thinking hes scared of them

explanation
