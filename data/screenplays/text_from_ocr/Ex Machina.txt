- a view above an ultra-cool ultra-designed open-plan
office

In a kitchen area young men and women mill and chat

Casually dressed Feels like an intelligent relaxed

environment

Behind them more young men and women sit at desks in front
of screens and keyboard

Each workstation is personalised Photographs of friends or
family or pets Cutting from magazines Ironic
superherovideo-game figurines

He types fast with two fingers

monitor

cut TO -
- the POV of the web-cam
Looking back at CALEB

Twenty four Glazed Ear buds in connected to cell phone
Head bobbing slightly to the music

As we watch from the monitor POV we can see the computers
facial recognition system in operation
Imaged as vector boxes which track CALEB’S face and the
faces of all the people behind him

- the COMPUTER MONITOR
On which a message appears in a small window over the code

VIP EMAIL RECEIVED

As CALEB stops typing

He gazes at the message

Then clicks on the link

Then mouths the word Fuck

CALEB reaches for his cell phone

cut TO -

- the CELL PHONE POV seen from the tiny camera above the
screen as CALEB lifts the phone and starts keying-in a

text

We see facial recognition software flickering over CALEB’S
features and reacting to shifts in his expression

- the cell phone The screen The tiny camera nestled above
it Lens glinting

On the screen a time-bar extends next to the word

A beat later a reply text message appears
WIF seriously

CALEB sends the word
yes
A beat later a stream of text messages start appearing
Buena estoria bro

- the computer monitor POV

Behind CALEB a few of the people behind CALEB in the office
are reacting

One stands and applauds

A GIRL comes out from behind her desk runs over to CALEB
and embraces him from behind planting a kiss on his cheek

CALEB still looks dazed

He still has his headphones in Still in the audio bubble
which despite the commotion around him remains unburst

TITLE

EX MACHINA

EXT MOUNTAINS - DAY 2

A spectacular mountain landscape Waterfalls drop down
massive rock faces to inland lakes Rivers push through
forest Forest spreads across valley floors which rise to
snow peaks

INT HELICOPTER - DAY 3

CALEB wakes abruptly -

- to find himself in the front seat of a helicopter
The pilot JAY is a man in his forties

Outside the window is the mountain landscape

CALEB
How long was I out
JAY
You fell asleep almost as soon as
we left the airport

CALEB looks around Wipes sleep out of his eyes Gets his
bearings

CALEB
Damn Can’t believe I’ve been
missing this I was so psyched to
be coming here I was awake all
night

JAY smiles

JAY

You’re a programmer right
CALEB

Yeah
JAY

Bay facility

CALEB
Long Island I work on algorithms
for the search engine

JAY
Algorithms Nice

CALEB
You know what they are

JAY
Nope But I knew you were a
programmer Soon as I set eyes on
you

CALEB
Is that a good thing

JAY
Means you and Mr Bateman speak the
same language I’d say that’s a
good thing

Beat

CALEB
I guess you know him pretty well

The pilot laughs

JAY
I’ve never even met him I only
fly this shuttle between the

airport and his residence
(MORE)
JAY (CONTD)
I did see him one time Stood on
one of these mountain ridges

JAY shrugs

JAY (CONTD)
Assume it was him anyway No one
else around for a hundred miles

JAY glances over at CALEB

JAY (CONTD)
So how does a programmer from Long
Island get to be meeting the CEO

CALEB
I won a competition It was kind
of like a lottery for employees
The winner got to spend a week with
him

JAY
The president can’t get Mr Bateman
on the phone but you got the
golden ticket

CALEB
Yep

JAY
Hell of an opportunity

CALEB
Believe me I know it

CALEB looks out of the window

CALEB (CONTD)
Incredible here

JAY
Alaska Most beautiful place on
Earth
Beat
CALEB
How long until we get to his
estate
JAY chuckles
JAY

Weve been flying over his estate
for the past two hours
EXT MOUNTAINS - DAY 4

The helicopter flies over a vast white glacier

EXT MOUNTAINS - DAY 5
CUT
EXT MOUNTAINS - DAY 6

The helicopter flies over the lip of a WATERFALL revealing a
valley

The valley floor is a forest and a single bright green
meadow Sunlit like a jewel in the icy mountains

A white-water river runs through it

INT HELICOPTER - DAY 7

CALEB looks down at the breathtaking view as the helicopter
banks turns and descends

EXT MEADOWLANDING SITE - DAY 8

Meadow flowers whip in the rotor wash as the helicopter
touches down in the vast meadow

By the landing site is a collection of huge metal crates
All have Chinese characters on the side

The rotor blades slow but don’t stop

JAY exits

EXT MEADOWLANDING SITE - DAY 9

JAY holds open the door as CALEB exits the helicopter cabin

CALEB looks around his eyes adjusting to the bright sunshine
outside

JAY goes to the side of the helicopter pops open a hatch
and removes CALEB’S luggage A large suitcase with wheels

CALEB looks around Apart from the packing crates there are
no man-made structures to be seen

CALEB shouts over the engine noise

CALEB
Youre leaving me here

JAY
This is as close as I’m allowed to
the building

CALEB
- What building

The pilot gestures vaguely towards the white water

JAY
Follow the river

JAY hands CALEB his bag
JAY (CONTD)
Please get a safe distance from the

blades

The pilot gets back inside the helicopter and closes the
door

CALEB hurriedly retreats with his bag

Moments later in a roar of wind and noise the helicopter is
lifting off

Equally suddenly the noise is fading and the helicopter is
soaring upwards and banking back towards the glacier

Then it is gone Bird song and wind rush replace engine
noise

CALEB suddenly looks very isolated

EXT RIVER - DAY 10

CALEB walks along the banks of the fast-flowing river
awkwardly bumping his wheeled suitcase over the ground

The banks of the river start to climb to an intimidating
drop

It feels that this can’t be the right way
CALEB reaches into his pocket and pulls out his mobile phone
No signal at all

He puts his phone back in his pocket

EXT RIVERHOUSE VIEW - DAY 11

CALEB rounds a bend in the river

Ahead almost hidden in trees there is a steel and glass
structure

12A

EXT CLEARING - DAY 12

CALEB walks towards the house through the trees

In the ground in a grassy clearing he finds a circular
window reflecting the sky

He walks up to the window and looks inside

It reveals what is effectively a glass-covered well - about
four metres deep with smooth concrete sides

At the bottom of the well is a brightly-lit room which
appears to be an office of some sort There is a desk with
monitors and a chair

But apparently no one inside

Beyond the clearing in the tree-line CALEB sees - almost

camouflaged by forest - the dark shapes and straight lines of
a low one storey building complex

EXT HOUSE - DAY 12A

CALEB approaches the building
As he nears the entrance -

- CALEB startles as an AUTOMATED VOICE speaks to him from
an unknown source

AUTOMATED VOICE
Caleb Smith

CALEB tracks the source of the voice

Near what seems to be the front door a pillar protrudes from
the ground Head-height With a GLASS SCREEN on one side

Below the screen is a DISPENSER

CALEB
«- Yes

AUTOMATED VOICE
Please approach the console and
face the screen

CALEB looks into the screen and as soon as he has locked
eyes with his own reflection the screen FLASHES A single
bright strobe

Almost immediately afterwards something small clatters into
the DISPENSER

AUTOMATED VOICE (CONT’D)
Take your keycard

13A

CALEB picks the object up It’s a credit-card sized ID

On it there is an embedded chip and a photograph of his
face He looks comically surprised

CALEB
- Can we do another

AUTOMATED VOICE
Your keycard now may be used to
enter the residence

CALEB walks up to the front door

Beside the door a KEYCARD PLATE is set into the wall with a
RED LED LIGHT

He holds his keycard ID
The RED LED light changes to BLUE

CALEB pushes the front door and it swings open

INT HOUSEMAIN ROOM - DAY 13

The front door opens to a glass-walled staircase which leads
down to an open-plan room

At the bottom of the staircase CALEB waits to see if he is
welcomed or noticed

But he is not

CALEB
Hello

Silence

Then he is startled a second time by sudden commencement of
a THUMPING SOUND

Abrupt Rapid More or less rhythmic From somewhere
nearby

He exits in the direction of the noise

INT HOUSEDINING AREA - DAY 13A

CALEB enters a dining area
Which now reveals
» a huge glass door

It presents an arresting view of a garden river and the
mountains behind

The door is open and through it we see the reason for the
thumping sound

Just outside on a patio in the sunshine a man is working a
PUNCH BAG

EXT GARDEN - DAY 14

CALEB exits the dining area to an area of neat garden
looking over the river and surrounded by the mountain
ranges

The punch bag is suspended by a chain on an exterior flanking
wall of the house

The man working it is wearing shorts and is shirtless
Bathed in sweat

His hands are not protected by gloves Only wraps Spots of
blood seep through the pale material around his knuckles

This is NATHAN BATEMAN He’s thirty
After a flurry of punches NATHAN breaks off

Breathing hard he wipes at his eyebrows with the back of his
wrist Sweat droplets cascade down his face

Then -
- NATHAN senses the other presence
He turns to see CALEB Standing by the open glass wall

NATHAN
Caleb

NATHAN beams

NATHAN (CONTD)
Caleb Smith

CALEB
ee Hi

NATHAN starts unravelling his wraps
NATHAN

Dude I’ve been so looking forward
to this

INT HOUSEDINING AREA - DAY 15

NATHAN walks past CALEB and goes to a bar area where there
is a jug of non-specific vegetable juice waiting anda
glass

NATHAN
Come in come in

CALEB puts his bag down

NATHAN (CONTD)
You want something to eat or drink
after your journey

CALEB
No Thank you I’m fine

NATHAN
You sure

NATHAN pours himself a glass of the vegetable juice

NATHAN (CONTD)
I’d been thinking we’d have
breakfast together but to be
honest I can’t eat anything right
now I gotta tell you - I woke up
this morning with the mother of all
fucking hangovers

CALEB
Yeah

NATHAN laughs
NATHAN
Like you wouldn’t believe And if
I have a heavy night I always try
to compensate the next morning
Exercise Juice Anti-oxidants
You know

CALEB
Sure

Silence as NATHAN drinks
CALEB feels he needs to say something

Looking around he sees a collection of empty beer bottle on
the kitchen counter

CALEB (CONTD)
- Was it a good party

NATHAN doesn’t answer
He’s still drinking
The silence extends a little Verges on odd

NATHAN puts his empty glass down
NATHAN
Party

NATHAN looks at CALEB His expression is unreadable

NATHAN (CONT’D)
Caleb I’m going to put this out
there so it’s said

CALEB waits

NATHAN (CONTD)
Youre freaked out

CALEB
-- I am

NATHAN
Yeah You’re freaked out by the
house and the mountains because
it’s all so super-cool And you’re
freaked out by me To be meeting
me In this room having this
conversation at this moment
Right

CALEB doesn’t have time to answer

NATHAN (CONTD)
And I get that The moment you’re
having

NATHAN smiles

NATHAN (CONTD)
But dude can we get it behind us
Can we just be two guys Nathan
and Caleb Not the whole employer-
employee thing

CALEB
Okay

Beat

CALEB (CONTD)
It’s good to meet you Nathan

CALEB holds out his hand
NATHAN beams

NATHAN
It’s good to meet you too Caleb

They shake

16A

When CALEB takes his hand back there is a little smear of
blood on his fingers

He discretely wipes it on his trousers

EXT HOUSEELEVATOR - DAY 16

NATHAN and CALEB enter an elevator
It has no buttons Only a keycard plate
NATHAN swipes his card

NATHAN
Down

The elevator starts to move

EXT RIVER - DAY 16A

Water flows over rocks

INT HOUSEGLASS CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS 17

CALEB and NATHAN exit the elevator into a glass corridor

The floor is polished concrete The walls and ceiling are
glass behind which diffused light glows

At regular intervals glass doors are set glowing with the
same light flush with the walls

Beside the closed doors are keycard plates and soft red LEDs

CALEB carries his bag looking slightly encumbered next to
NATHAN

NATHAN
So I guess the first thing I should
do is explain your pass It’s

simple enough It opens some
doors but it doesn’t open others
And that just makes everything easy
for you right

CALEB
-- Uh yes

NATHAN
Because you’re like oh fuck I’m
in someone else’s house can I do
this can I do that And this card
takes all that worry away If you
try to open a door and it stays

shut okay it’s off limits
(MORE )

NATHAN (CONTD)
If you try another door and it
opens it’s for you
NATHAN stops by a door

NATHAN (CONTD)
Let’s try this one

CALEB hunts around in his pockets for his keycard
Then swipes the card on the plate
The LED turns blue

NATHAN (CONTD)

Guess it’s for you Caleb

INT HOUSECALEB’S BEDROOM - DAY

NATHAN follows CALEB into a bedroom

NATHAN
You like

It has the vibe of a mid-level business hotel Bed table

TV
Except it has no windows

NATHAN (CONTD)
It’s your room You got yourself a
bed cupboards a little desk and
a bathroom through there A little
fridge

NATHAN opens the fridge Inside it is full of bottled water

NATHAN (CONTD)
Cosy right

CALEB puts his bags down

CALEB
You bet This is great

NATHAN
What

CALEB
Sorry

NATHAN
There’s something wrong What is
it

CALEB
There’s nothing wrong

NATHAN
It’s the windows You’re thinking
there’s no windows And it’s not
cosy It’s claustrophobic

CALEB
No No way I wasn’t thinking
that I was thinking this is
really cool

NATHAN
Caleb There’s a reason the room
has no windows

CALEB
There is

NATHAN
Uh-huh In many ways this
building isn’t a house It’s a
research facility Buried in these
walls are enough fibre optic cables
to reach the Moon and lasso it

NATHAN sits on the bed

NATHAN (CONTD)
And I want to talk to you about
what I’m researching I want to
share it with you In fact I want
to share it with you so much it’s
eating me up inside

Beat
NATHAN (CONTD)
But there’s something I need you to

do for me first

CALEB
- What

NATHAN indicates the desk - where a pen sits next to a
printed document

INT HOUSECALEB’S BEDROOM - DAY 19

CALEB sits at the desk in his room holding NATHAN’S pen
In front of him is a sheet of paper which reads at the top

NON DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT
CALEB
‘The signee agrees to regular data
audit with unlimited access to
confirm that no disclosure of
information has taken place in
public or private forums using any
means of communication including
but not limited to that which is
disclosed orally or in written or
electronic form’

CALEB glances back at NATHAN on the bed

CALEB (CONTD)
I think I need a lawyer

NATHAN
It’s standard

CALEB
It doesn’t feel very standard

NATHAN
Okay it’s not standard

NATHAN shrugs
NATHAN (CONTD)

What can I tell you You don’t
have to sign We could spend the
next seven days shooting pool and
getting drunk together Bonding
And when you discover what you
missed out on in a year or so’s
time you’1ll spend the rest of your
life regretting it

CALEB turns back to the desk

Looks at the paper

Then hesitates a final moment -

- and signs

When he looks round NATHAN has moved from the bed
standing directly behind him

NATHAN (CONTD)
Good call

NATHAN takes the piece of paper
Folds it Puts it in his pocket

NATHAN (CONTD)
So

and is
Beat

NATHAN (CONTD)
Do you know what the Turing Test
is

CALEB reacts - immediately knowing what NATHAN has just
implied

CALEB
- Yeah I know what the Turing
Test is

NATHAN waits

CALEB (CONT’D)
It’s where a human interacts with a
computer And if the human can’t
tell they’re interacting with a
computer the test is passed

NATHAN
And what does a pass tell us
CALEB
That the computer has artificial
intelligence

Beat

CALEB (CONT’D)
Are you telling me you’re
building an AI

NATHAN shakes his head

NATHAN
I’ve already built one

NATHAN stands

NATHAN (CONTD)
And over the next few days you’re
going to be the human component in
a Turing Test

CALEB
- Holy shit

NATHAN
That’s right Caleb You got it
Because if that test is passed you
are dead center of the single
greatest scientific event in the
history of man

CALEB
If you’ve created a conscious
machine it’s not the history of
man It’s the history of Gods
NATHAN smiles

NATHAN
I like you

cut TO -

INT HOUSEOBSERVATION ROOM - DAY 20

- what appears to be a neon coloured jellyfish Tendrils
like axons hanging in a black-blue liquid space

REVEAL -
- the jellyfish is contained in a glass orb

Which is held in an exposed cavity at the back of machined
skull-shape

- which is part of a robot girl
Her name is AVA
She’s an extraordinary piece of engineering

Proportioned as a slender female in her twenties her limbs
and torso are a mixture of metal and plastic and carbon
fibre

The carbon fibre is charcoal colour The plastic is cream
The metal has the yellow-warmth of nickel

The shapes of her body approximate the form of muscle There
are biceps and breasts Her hands have five delicate
digits

Her body-structure is covered in a delicate skin The skin
is a mesh in the pattern of a honeycomb Like a spiderweb
it is almost invisible unless side-lit

The one part of her that is not obviously an inorganic
construct is her face - which is that of a strikingly
beautiful girl Created in a defined oval from the top of
the forehead to just below her chin Indistinguishable from
a real girl in its appearance and in the way it moves -
except for one thing

There is a very slight almost imperceptible blankness in her
eyes

As we observe AVA she fits a section of skull-plate to the
back of her head which obscures the glass orb and jellyfish
structure

Then -

- she half turns As if having become aware of another
presence in the room

REVEAL -
- the room in which AVA stands
AVAS living area is made up of three primary spaces

The main area is the OBSERVATION ROOM A large area
arranged around a glass box from which she can be viewed

At the back of the observation room behind a sheet of semi-
opaque glass is the PRIVATE AREA This contains a bed-like
structure a desk a wardrobe and a mirror

And behind the private area is the GARDEN AREA This is a
small decorative indoor garden lit by lamps The garden is
sealed off from AVA by a thick wall of glass

There are also several oval discs positioned around the room
made of some kind of dark non-reflective material These are
induction plates

And there is a chair which faces the glass observation box

And facing that chair inside the observation box is another
chair

Beside which CALEB stands

A beat -

- as CALEB and AVA see each other for the first time

Then -

- AVA starts walking Revealing a secondary impact of her
engineering how she moves The unconscious precision of her

steps The fluidity of her action

CALEB is transfixed as she covers the length of the room to
her chair

Then she sits down
And speaks

AVA
Hello

Her voice has no digital inflections It is just the voice
of a girl
CALEB gathers himself

CALEB
ee Hi

AVA
Who are you

CALEB
I’m Caleb

AVA
Hello Caleb

CALEB
-- Do you have a name

AVA
Yes Ava

CALEB
-- I’m pleased to meet you Ava

AVA
I’m pleased to meet you too

CALEB sits opposite her

He is alone on his half of the glass Nathan is nowhere to
be seen

But on the ceiling and attached to the walls on both sides
of the glass there are several CCTV cameras Trained
variously on CALEB and AVA Lenses twitching

CUT BACK to AVA

She watches CALEB Then cocks her head slightly to the side

AVA (CONTD)
Are you nervous

CALEB frowns

CALEB
-- Why do you ask that

A beat
Then AVA repeats her question

AVA
Are you nervous
CALEB
- Yes A little

AVA
Why

CALEB
I’m not sure

AVA
I feel nervous too

CALEB
« Do you

AVA
Yes

CALEB
Why do you feel nervous

AVA
I’ve never met anyone new before
Only Nathan

CALEB
Then we’re both in quite a
similar position

AVA
Haven’t you met lots of new people
before

CALEB

None like you

AVA
Oh

Beat

CALEB
So lLet’s break the ice

He glances at her Observing

CALEB (CONTD)
Do you know what I mean by that

AVA
Yes

CALEB
What do I mean

AVA
Overcome initial social
awkwardness

Beat

CALEB
So let’s have a conversation If
we talk we’ll both relax and get
to know each other at the same
time

AVA
Okay What would you like to have
a conversation about

CALEB
Why don’t we start with you telling
me something about yourself

AVA
What would you like to know

CALEB
Whatever comes into your head

AVA pauses a moment

AVA
Well You already know my name
And you can see that I’m a machine
(beat)
Would you like to know how old I
am

CALEB
Sure

AVA
I’m one

CALEB
One what One year Or one day

AVA
One

A beat on CALEB Processing

Her answer feels like the near non-sequitur that typically
betray AI responses

AVA (CONTD)
Does that seem young to you

CALEB
Quite young
(beat)
When did you learn how to speak

AVA pauses as if considering this question for the first
time
AVA
I don’t think I did learn I
always knew how to speak - and
that’s strange isn’t it

CALEB
Why

AVA
Because language is something that
people acquire

CALEB
Some believe language exists in the
brain from birth and what is
learned is the ability to attach
words and structure to the latent

ability
Beat
CALEB (CONT’D)
Would you agree
AVA
-- I don’t know I have no
opinion on that
Beat

AVA (CONTD)
I like to draw

CALEB says nothing
Just watches AVA Again lets the non-sequitur sit
AVA (CONTD)
I don’t have any of my pictures

with me now but I can show you
them tomorrow

CALEB
That sounds good I’d like to see
them

AVA
Yes

Beat

AVA (CONTD)
Will you come back tomorrow Caleb

CALEB smiles slightly

CALEB
Yeah Definitely

AVA also smiles
And suddenly -

- there is a strong sense of something very human there
the way the smile lights up her face

AVA
Good

EXT HOUSEGARDEN - DUSK

A view of the house over the meadows

The sun setting is behind the mountain peaks making the
edges of the clouds glow like light-bulb filaments

INT HOUSEDINING AREA - DUSK

CALEB and NATHAN are in the dining area
It is set for dinner Only two chairs
NATHAN is at the table nursing a bottle of Peroni beer

CALEB stands by panoramic window looking at the view

NATHAN
So
CALEB turns
CALEB
Sorry I was just ordering my
thoughts
NATHAN

Don’t order Just speak

CALEB
She’s fascinating When you talk
to her you’re through the looking
glass

NATHAN nods Approving

NATHAN
‘Through the looking glass’
Youve got a way with words there
Caleb You’re quotable

CALEB
Actually it’s someone else’s
quote

In

NATHAN
You know I wrote it down That
other line you came up with About
how if I’ve created a conscious
machine I’m not man I’m God

CALEB
- I don’t think that’s exactly
what I said

NATHAN doesn’t seem to hear

NATHAN
I just thought - fuck That’s so
perfect It’s so good for the
story when we get to tell it ‘I
turned to Caleb and he was looking
back at me And he said you’re
not a man you’re a God’

CALEB
But I didn’t say that

NATHAN
Whatever it was you said I wrote
it down

As a kind of punctuation mark NATHAN downs the remains of
his beer Then stands and gets another from the bar

NATHAN (CONTD)
So anyway First impressions
youre impressed

CALEB
Yes Although -

NATHAN laughs

NATHAN
‘Although’ There’s a
qualification to you being
impressed

CALEB
No No qualification to her Just
- in the Turing test the machine
should be hidden from the examiner
And there’s a control or -

NATHAN waves a hand

NATHAN
I think we’re past that If I hid
Ava from you so you just heard her

voice she would pass for human
(MORE )
NATHAN (CONTD)
The real test is to show you she is
a robot Then see if you still
feel she has consciousness

CALEB
I think you’re probably right Her
language abilities are incredible
The system is stochastic right

NATHAN looks at CALEB blankly

CALEB (CONTD)
Non-deterministic

NATHAN still says nothing

CALEB presses on

Silence

CALEB (CONTD)
At first I thought she was mapping
from internal semantic form to
syntactic tree-structure then
getting linearised words But then
I started to realise the model was
probabalistic with statistical
training - or at least some kind of
hybrid

CALEB (CONTD)
--- No

NATHAN
Caleb I understand you want me to
explain how Ava works But - I’m
sorry I don’t think I’1l be able
to do that

CALEB
Try me I’m hot on high-level
abstraction and -

NATHAN
(cuts in)
It’s not because you’re too dumb
It’s because I want to have a beer
and a conversation with you Not a
seminar

CALEB
Oh Sorry

NATHAN
It’s cool

NATHAN studies at CALEB for a beat

NATHAN (CONTD)
Just answer me this What do you
feel about her Nothing
analytical Just - how do you
feel

CALEB
I feel

CALEB pauses

CALEB (CONT’D)
- that she’s fucking amazing

NATHAN smiles
Then lifts his bottle

NATHAN
Dude Cheers

CALEB lifts his bottle too

CALEB
Cheers

The glass of the bottles touch

INT HOUSECALEB’S BEDROOM - NIGHT 23
CUT
INT HOUSECALEB’S BATHROOM - NIGHT 24

CALEB stands in his boxer shorts brushing his teeth by the
sink

REVEAL several long scars on his back

Neat Unusual Long-healed But from serious wounds or
surgery

INT HOUSECALEB’S BEDROOM - NIGHT 25
CUT

INT HOUSECALEB’S BEDROOM - NIGHT 26
Darkness

The clock reads 0132 am

The soft glow from the digital readout throws a light on the
remote control

REVEAL CALEB

Eyes closed For a beat

Then his eyes open He’s wide awake
He turns over in the bed

Then turns back again

cut TO -

228 am

CALEB lies watching the digital clock as the numbers change
to 229 am

CALEB
God damn it

He reaches for the remote control
CLICK

The TV at the foot of the bed switches on suddenly lighting
up the room with cold TV glow

CALEB squeezes his eyes shut momentarily dazzled by the
brightness

When his eyes open again instead of seeing a TV station he
sees a LIVE FEED from a CCTV camera

It shows the OBSERVATION ROOM
CALEB sits upright in bed

CALEB (CONTD)
What the fuck

AVA is sat at the table

Drawing

CUT BETWEEN -

- CALEB watching AVA

- and varying CCTV ANGLES of AVA as she draws

The different TV channels flip between feeds from the various
cameras

CALEB is transfixed by the imagery

Her posture Her legs tucked beneath the chair The curve
of the breasts on her synthetic torso

The CCTV images become CALEB’S POV The things he is
observing
CLOSE-UPS of her face Her eyes Her mouth
The way she bites her lip in an expression of concentration
As when she smiled there is a powerful sense in this tiny

gesture of her feeling sentient and human

Even more so because her face fills the screen hiding the
mechanical parts of her form

Throughout we never clearly see what AVA is actually
drawing

END ON -
CALEB Glazed
Then ABRUPTLY -
- the TV goes dead
And the digital alarm clock goes dead
And the windowless room is plunged into total darkness and
total silence As if the house had been previously filled
with a soft hum of power which we were unaware of until it
was gone
In this we hear CALEB breathing
AUTOMATED VOICE

Power cut Back up power

activated
Soft emergency lighting comes on
CALEB hesitates a moment
Then gets out of bed
Goes to his bedroom door
Beside the keycard plate the LED is red
He swipes it with his card
The LED stays red

AUTOMATED VOICE (CONT’D)
Full facility lock-down until main

generator is restored

CALEB
- Are you kidding

He tries his card again

AUTOMATED VOICE
Full facility lock-down until main
generator is restored
CALEB looks around his windowless room
Which suddenly has the quality of a prison cell
Beats pass
Then -

- as abruptly as the power went off it comes back again

The emergency lighting goes off the TV and digital alarm
clock turn back on

AUTOMATED VOICE (CONT’D)
Power restored

CALEB stands in the flickering TV light
Then he tries his card again
This time the LED turns blue and the door opens Revealing

the GLASS CORRIDOR outside

INT HOUSEGLASS CORRIDOR - NIGHT 27

CALEB walks out of his room
The glass corridor illuminates as CALEB enters

Ahead one of the doors off the corridor is ajar

INT HOUSEPOLLOCK ROOM - NIGHT 28

CALEB enters the room with the open door
It appears to be empty Still and silent Low lit

Only one area is properly illuminated a wall on which a
large JACKSON POLLOCK drip painting hangs

CALEB walks towards it Studies the strange strands of
looping colour for a moment

A TELEPHONE on a low table

CALEB walks over to it with a half glance over his shoulder
as if sensing he is doing something that - obscurely - he
shouldnt

Then he picks up the handset

It’s dead

He hits some buttons

It stays dead

There is a slot by the phone

CALEB puts two and two together He reaches into his pocket
Pulls out his KEYCARD Puts it in the slot

--- and a light on the handset glows red

NATHAN
Sorry dude

CALEB startles Turns

NATHAN is lying on a sofa A bottle of Peroni rests on his

stomach

On the carpet beside him are a couple of empties

NATHAN (CONTD)
You don’t have clearance to use the
phone

NATHAN’S voice is very slightly slurred

NATHAN (CONTD)
You understand Given Ava And
you being kind of an unknown I
mean - a great guy and so on
Instant pals But

CALEB puts the handset back in its cradle

NATHAN (CONTD)
Who did you want to call

CALEB
I don’t know No one really

NATHAN
Ghostbusters

CALEB
What

NATHAN

Who’d ya want to call
Ghostbusters You don’t remember
that It’s a good movie A ghost
gives Dan Ackroyd oral sex

CALEB
I was wondering how the phone
worked That’s all

NATHAN
Uh huh

Beat

NATHAN (CONTD)
What are you doing awake at this
time anyway Did you come to join
the party

CALEB
» Something happened in my room
Some kind of power cut So I came
to see what’s going on

NATHAN
Ah The power cuts Yeah weve
been getting them recently I’m
uh working on it

CALEB
I couldn’t open the door to the
bedroom

NATHAN

It’s a security measure Automatic
lockdown Otherwise anyone could
open the place up just by disabling
the juice

NATHAN smiles

NATHAN (CONTD)
If it happens again relax Okay

CALEB
Sure

NATHAN lifts his beer

NATHAN
Sweet dreams

EXT MOUNTAINS - NIGHT

Above the mountains dense star constellations wheel in the
clear sky

INT HOUSECALEB’S BEDROOM - MORNING

CALEB is woken by light flooding on to his face

The door to his room has been opened

Ou

CAI

tside is the bright glass corridor

LEB sits up to see a GIRL entering his room

She looks Japanese She’s stunningly pretty And she
doesn’t say anything

Just walks in carrying a tray with a cafetiere which she
puts on CALEB’S bedside table

CALEB
ee Hi

The JAPANESE GIRL doesn’t answer

Just turns and leaves

EXT GARDENGYM AREA - DAY 31

In the garden near the hanging punch bag there is an
outdoor gym area A collection of free-weights and exercise
equipment

NATHAN is lying on an inclined board with his feet hooked
around a bar doing sit ups

CALEB approaches carrying his coffee
NATHAN continues to exercise as he talks
NATHAN
Hey Sorry to send Kyoko to wake

you man I just didn’t want too
much of the day to slip by

CALEB
No It was a good thing Thank
you

NATHAN

She’s some alarm clock huh Gets
you right up in the morning

CALEB smiles

NATHAN (CONTD)
So Day two You set

CALEB
You bet

NATHAN finishes his set and stands

NATHAN
So what’s the plan today Hit me

CALEB
I’m not sure I’m still trying to
figure the examination format
Testing Ava by conversation is kind

of a closed loop
(MORE)
CALEB (CONTD)

Like trying to test a chess
computer by only playing chess

NATHAN
How else would you test a chess
computer

CALEB

It depends what you’re testing it
for You can play it to find out
if it makes good moves But it
won’t tell you if it knows it’s
playing chess Or if it even knows
what chess is

NATHAN starts adding weights to curl dumbbells

NATHAN
So it’s simulation versus actual

CALEB
Exactly And I think being able to
differentiate between those two is
the Turing test you want me to
perform The difference between an
‘AI’ and an ‘I’

NATHAN laughs

NATHAN
‘An AI and an I’ Beautiful I’m
going to start following you around
with a fucking dictaphone

NATHAN glances over at CALEB

NATHAN (CONTD)
In the meantime do me a favour
Ease up a little on the text-book
approach All I want is simple
answers to simple questions Last
night I asked how you feel about
her And you gave me a great
answer

NATHAN starts doing curls
NATHAN (CONTD)
Now the question is how does she
feel about you

A beat On CALEB

cut TO -

INT HOUSEOBSERVATION ROOM - DAY

- CALEB and AVA facing each other through the glass of the

observation room

AVA
I brought you a drawing

AVA holds a piece of paper to the glass

The marks on it are

totally abstract A mesh of tiny black marks that swirl
around the page like iron filings in magnetic field patterns

CALEB
- What’s it a drawing of

AVA
Don’t you know

CALEB
No

AVA looks disappointed

AVA

Oh I thought you would tell me

CALEB
Don’t you know

AVA

I do drawings every day But I

never know what they’re of

CALEB
Are you not trying to sketch

something specific Like an object

or a person

She shakes her head as she takes the picture down

CALEB (CONTD)
Maybe you should try

AVA
Okay What object should I draw
CALEB
Whatever you want It’s your
decision
AVA

Why is it my decision

CALEB

I’m interested to see what you’1ll

choose

AVA pauses a moment
AVA
Do you want to be my friend

CALEB
- Of course

AVA
Will it be possible

CALEB
Why wouldn’t it be

AVA
Our conversations are one-sided
You ask circumspect questions and
study my responses

AVA looks at CALEB directly Meets his gaze evenly

AVA (CONTD)
It’s true isn’t it

CALEB
«- Yes

AVA
You learn about me and I learn
nothing about you That’s not a
foundation on which friendships are
based

CALEB is taken aback Aware that the AI has just wrong-
footed him on a point of argument

CALEB
That’s a fair comment

AVA
Yes
CALEB
So - you want me to talk about
myself
AVA
Yes
CALEB

Where do you want me to start

AVA
It’s your decision I’m interested
to see what you’ll choose

And now CALEB is aware that AVA has just - gently - used
sarcasm

He looks at her frowning slightly

And in response in a very human way AVA arches an eyebrow
CALEB laughs

CALEB
Okay Ava Well - you know my
name I’m twenty four And I work
at Nathan’s company You know what
his company is

AVA
Blue Book named after
Wittgenstein’s notes is the
world’s most popular internet
search engine processing an
average of ninety four percent of
all internet search requests

CALEB
That’s right

AVA
Where do you live Caleb

CALEB
Brookhaven Long Island

AVA
Is it nice there

CALEB
It’s okay I’ve got an apartment
Kind of small But - it’s a five
minute walk to the office Anda
five minute walk to the ocean
which I like

AVA
Are you married

CALEB
No

AVA

Is your status single

CALEB
- Yeah

They lock eyes just for a moment

AVA
What about your family

CALEB
Grew up in Portland No brothers
or sisters My parents were both

high school teachers
(MORE)
CALEB (CONTD)
(beat)

And if we’re getting to know each
other I guess I should say they’re
both dead Car crash when I was
fifteen In fact I was in the car
with them Back seat But it was
the front that got the worst of it

A long beat
A kind of processing pause for AVA

AVA
I’m sorry

CALEB nods

CALEB
I spent a lot of time in the
hospital Nearly a year Got into
coding By the time I made it to
college I was pretty advanced

AVA

An advanced programmer
CALEB

Yes
AVA

Like Nathan

CALEB
Yes

CALEB hesitates Back-tracks
CALEB (CONT’D)

Or - kind of Nathan wrote the
Blue Book base code when he was
thirteen If you understand code
what he did was - Mozart or
something

Beat

AVA
Do you like Mozart

CALEB smiles

CALEB
I like Depeche Mode

AVA
Do you like Nathan

CALEB misses a beat Thrown momentarily

CALEB
Yes Of course

AVA
Is Nathan your friend

cut TO -
- one of the CCTV cameras that are observing them

CALEB
Sure

AVA
A good friend

He hesitates

CALEB
Well a good friend is -

He breaks off Feeling the camera watching
CALEB (CONT’D)
We only just met It takes time to
get to know -
AT THAT MOMENT -

- all the power abruptly shuts down plunging the room into
darkness

AUTOMATED VOICE
Power cut Back up power
activated

Then the soft emergency lighting lifts up and throws the
observation room into a completely different light

Weirder Cast from LED strips on the floor illuminating
CALEB and AVA’s faces from below

In the low light we see a detail of AVA’S honeycomb skin-
mesh that we were not able to see before

It glows soft like phosphorescence - and this changes the
way we see AVA Where the mesh is almost invisible in bright
conditions it is now the dominant describer of her form So
instead of seeing AVA as a primarily robot structure we now
see the curves and lines of a naked female body

cut TO -

- the CCTV CAMERAS Which are unpowered hanging dead

cut TO -

- CALEB glancing round at the door to the room where the
panel LED glows red

cut TO -
— AVA
Watching CALEB with a strange intensity

The vague quality of blankness in her eyes is completely
gone

AVA
Caleb

CALEB turns Sees the way AVA is looking at him

AVA (CONTD)
You’re wrong

CALEB
- Wrong about what

AVA
Nathan

CALEB
-- In what way

AVA
He isn’t your friend

CALEB
Excuse me

CALEB frowns
CALEB (CONT’D)
I’m sorry Ava I don’t understand
what you’re -
AVA
(cuts in)
You shouldn’t trust him You
shouldn’t trust anything he says
AVA presses her hand to the glass

AVA (CONTD)
Trust me

Then -
- the emergency lighting suddenly dims
» and the normal lighting starts fading up

CALEB turns —

- just in time to see the CCTV CAMERAS twitch back into life

AUTOMATED VOICE
Power restored

When CALEB looks back at AVA she has returned to her
previous posture facial expression and manner

She looks directly at CALEB and talks as if continuing a
conversation they have been having

AVA
- and if we made a list of books or
works of art which we both know it
would form the ideal basis of a
discussion

A beat
AVA (CONTD)
(prompts )
Is that okay Caleb

They lock eyes for a moment

CALEB
-- Yes
AVA smiles
AVA
Good
INT HOUSECABIN - LATE AFTERNOON 33

Trees and shrubs cast long shadows across the manicured lawn

Through the glass wall we can see the Japanese girl KYOKO
preparing sushi

INT HOUSEDINING AREA - NIGHT 34

CALEB and NATHAN sit at the dining table

Lanterns are laid out across the terrace

KYOKO lays out different kinds of salad between them Each
is beautifully prepared Leaves are spread and overlapped
like fish scales

As she does so she knocks a bottle of wine on the table

It tips and lands on its side and immediately starts
emptying A deep red stain blossoming across the linen

CALEB pushes back his chair as the liquid pushes towards him
then starts to fall to the floor
NATHAN
Shit Kyoko Are you serious
(to Caleb)
Did it get you

CALEB
No No problem

CALEB takes his napkin and leans down to start wiping the
floor

Then KYOKO appears beside him

She holds her hand out for the napkin

NATHAN
Give her the cloth
CALEB
(to Kyoko)
It’s okay don’t worry I’ve got
it
NATHAN

Dude - you’re wasting your time
She can’t speak a word of English

Her hand remains outstretched
CALEB hesitates Then hands her the napkin
KYOKO kneels and starts to wipe the wine off the floor

NATHAN (CONTD)

It’s like a firewall against leaks
Means I can talk trade secrets over
dinner with an HOD or CEO and know
it will go no further Right
Kyoko

She looks up at her name

NATHAN (CONTD)

But it also means I can’t tell her
I’m pissed when she’s so fucking
clumsy that she pours wine over my
house guest

KYOKO goes back to cleaning around CALEB’S feet
CALEB looks visibly uncomfortable
CALEB

I think she gets that you’re
pissed

NATHAN
Good Because I am pissed Hey
Kyoko

KYOKO looks over again

NATHAN (CONT’D)
Go-go

She stands and leaves

NATHAN walks to over the bar where he picks up another
bottle

NATHAN (CONTD)
It’s funny It doesn’t matter how
rich you are shit goes wrong You
can’t insulate yourself from it
It’s supposed to be death and taxes
you can’t avoid But actually it’s
death and shit

NATHAN walks back to the table Fills CALEB’S glass Then
his own

NATHAN (CONTD)
It’s like these power cuts You
would not believe how much I spent
on the generator system here But
I’m getting failures every day

CALEB
Do you know why they happen

NATHAN
No The system was supposed to be
bullet proof but the guys who
installed it obviously fucked
something up

CALEB
Can’t you call them back

NATHAN
There’s too much classified stuff
here So after the job was done I
had them all killed
CALEB shoots a glance at NATHAN Confirms just joking
NATHAN drains his glass
Then refills

CALEBS glass is still untouched
NATHAN (CONTD)
Anyway Here’s to your second day
Cheers

CALEB
Cheers

They drink

NATHAN
So how did it go What have you
got to report

CALEB hesitates

Then answers Casual

Beat

CALEB
You saw how the day went didn’t
you I mean I assume you’re
watching on the CCTV

NATHAN
Sure But I want to hear your
take

CALEB
There was one interesting thing
that happened with Ava today

NATHAN
- Yeah

CALEB
She made a joke

NATHAN
Right When she threw your line
back at you About being
interested to see what she’d
choose I noticed that too

CALEB
It got me thinking In a way the
joke is the best indication of AI
I’ve seen in her It’s discretely
complicated Kind of non-autistic

NATHAN
What do you mean

CALEB
It was a play on words and a play
on me She could only do that with
an awareness of her own mind and
also of awareness of mine

NATHAN smiles
NATHAN
Yeah She’s aware of you all
right
NATHAN drinks Watching CALEB

NATHAN (CONTD)
And what about the power cut

CALEB freezes up Subtly

CALEB
Sorry

NATHAN
The power cut That was the only
bit I couldn’t see All the
cameras fail I lose audio the
works
Beat

NATHAN (CONTD)
So what happened

CALEB takes a sip of his wine

NATHAN waits

CALEB
Nothing

NATHAN
Nothing She didn’t remark on it
at all

CALEB puts the glass down And meets NATHAN’S gaze

CALEB
No Not really

ON NATHAN’S GLASS - refilling The view through it of
CALEB disappearing in the red liquid

35 INT HOUSECALEB’S BATHROOM - NIGHT 35
CUT
36 INT HOUSECALEB’S BATHROOM - NIGHT 36

CALEB stands in shorts in front of the sink having a shave

He leans forwards into the mirror as if checking to make
sure he shaved properly on his cheek

And he hears the noise again The servo making a tiny
corrective movement
CALEB catches his own gaze in the mirror
Then he deliberately steps sideways and turns his head
Ostensibly to check the other cheek But actually to have
shifted his position
And he hears the noise again
Very faint But definitely there
A micro beat
Then CALEB pulls back and continues shaving
Not giving any outward indication that he has just figured

out that there is a camera behind the bathroom mirror

INT HOUSECALEB’S BEDROOM - NIGHT 37

Clean-shaved CALEB walks into his bedroom

On the TV the live feed of AVA’S room is playing - though
she is not in shot

Subtly CALEBS gaze flicks to different points around the
room

To the full-length mirror on the wall

The high vent for the air-conditioning system

The TV itself

CALEB hesitates for a moment

Then pulls on a T-Shirt Picks up his ID card And exits
cut TO -

- the TV

AVA walks in to the locked-off CCTV shot

She walks towards an induction plate rests her hand against
it and starts charging herself

As she does so almost imperceptibly the lights dim and a
slight static charge passes over the television screen

INT HOUSEGLASS CORRIDOR - NIGHT 38

CALEB walks along the glass corridor

Systematically trying his ID CARD on the doors he passes
He tries one
Then another Then another Then another

Every single door remains locked

INT HOUSECABIN - NIGHT 39

CALEB enters a small room with a view over the river and
garden

It is virtually the only room apart from his own that he
seems able to gain access to

The lights are all off The room is only lit by the
moonlight through the sliding glass wall and lanterns in the
garden

He starts walking towards the glass wall

Then stops

On the patio NATHAN is working the punch bag

KYOKO stands a few feet away from him holding a white towel

With the glass wall closed no noise of the impacts
penetrates into the room

CALEB watches

NATHAN’S attack on the bag seems strange More extreme than
the hard workout we saw the first time he was using the bag

This seems brutal Almost frenzied

For a few moments the attack on the bag is observed in
silence from inside the main room

We can only hear the sound of CALEB’S breathing

cut TO -

EXT GARDENGYM AREA - NIGHT 40

- the punch bag and a sudden explosion of noise Of impacts
and exertions

Blood smearing the leather where it has soaked through the
knuckle wraps

Then -

— BANG

A particularly hard right hook connects and splits the

cut TO -

INT HOUSEDINING AREA - NIGHT

- CALEB Watching

Coloured strips of ribbon are visible through the split
the bag

NATHAN stands catching his breath

Then he reaches out a hand

KYOKO hands him the towel

NATHAN wipes his face

Then reaches out again this time catching KYOKO’S arm
He pulls her towards him and starts to kiss her
Reaching under her shirt

Pulling her skirt up over her thighs

INT HOUSECALEB’S ROOM - NIGHT

CALEB re-enters his room and closes the door

After a beat the lights in the corridor fade out

EXT MOUNTAINS - NIGHT

The moon hangs in the sky

INT HOUSEOBSERVATION ROOM - BLACK AND WHITE

Everything in the frame is black and white

bag

in

CLOSE UP on AVA’S meticulous abstract pictures scattered on

a table
CALEB is looking at them
REVEAL he is in the observation room

But he is on AVA’S side of the glass

And AVA is on his side Seen through the opaque glass that

divides the private area from the observation area

CALEB
Ava

CALEB walks to the connecting corridor and enters it

EXT GARDEN - BLACK AND WHITE 45

The door leads CALEB straight out into the gardens

In black and white the backdrop of mountains and clouds look
like an Ansel Adams

A short distance ahead of CALEB standing on the grass he
sees AVA

She locks eyes with him
Smiles
He starts to walk towards her

cut TO -

INT HOUSECALEB’S BEDROOM - NIGHT 46

- CALEB waking in his dark bedroom

Lit by light from his TV

Where AVA lies on her bed seeming to be asleep
CALEB sits up

Thinking Perhaps replaying his dream Gazing at AVA’S
resting form

Then reaches for the remote control on the bedside table and
switches the TV off

CUT TO -

EXT GARDEN - MORNING 47
CUT

EXT GARDENGYM AREA - MORNING 48

- a brand new punch bag hangs in the patio Swinging
slightly in the breeze

INT HOUSEOBSERVATION ROOM - DAY 49

CALEB and AVA face each other

AVA is holding up a piece of paper to the glass

AVA
I drew the picture of something
specific as you asked

The drawing is constructed with the same tiny black ink marks
as before But now they have ordered into a coherent black
and white image

It depicts AVA’S view OF THE ENCLOSED GARDEN IN HER ROOM
Beat

AVA (CONTD)
You said it would be interesting to
see what I would draw Is it
interesting

CALEB
Yes It is

She takes the drawing down

CALEB (CONT’D)
Have you never been outside this
building

AVA
No

CALEB
You’ve never walked outside

AVA
I’ve never been outside the room I
am in now

AVA thinks a moment

AVA (CONTD)
I think there was another room in
which I was constructed But I
have no memory of it so it’s
similar to your relationship with
the womb

CALEB
Where would you go if you did
go outside

AVA
You mean if I could go outside If
I was permitted

CALEB says nothing Does not overtly respond to the emphasis
she has placed on her lack of freedom
But their gaze locks for a beat
AVA (CONTD)
I’m not sure There are so many
options
Beat
AVA (CONTD)

Maybe a busy pedestrian and traffic
intersection in a city

CALEB smiles

CALEB
A traffic intersection

AVA
Is that a bad idea

CALEB
It wasn’t what I was expecting

AVA
A traffic intersection would
provide a concentrated but shifting
view of human life

CALEB
People watching

AVA
Yes

Beat

AVA (CONTD)
We could go together

CALEB
It’s a date

Another beat On AVA Looking at CALEB
Then -
AVA
There’s something else I wanted to

show you Apart from the picture

CALEB
Okay

AVA
But I feel nervous

CALEB
Why

AVA
You might think it’s stupid
CALEB
I don’t think I will Whatever it
is
AVA hesitates
AVA

Then - close your eyes

CALEB
-- Okay

He closes his eyes

AVA stands and walks to the PRIVATE AREA at the back of the
observation room

As she walks CALEB reopens his eyes

Through the semi-opaque dividing glass he watches her The
ghost image

cut TO -
— AVA

In the PRIVATE AREA she opens a wardrobe space which
reveals clothes and a hair-piece

Then she starts to get dressed

First a summer dress

Then stockings

Then a long-sleeved cardigan

She checks her reflection in the mirror and adjusts the
clothes slightly Making sure that as much of her robot form
is covered as possible

Then she puts on the hair-piece Short brown hair
Finally she makes a subtle adjustment to her face Similar
to putting on make-up she adjusts the intensity of her own
skin tones Her lips redden Her cheeks blush slightly A
discreet line of black extends like mascara around her eyes
cut TO -

— CALEB

Watching the ghost shape through the opaque glass

As she starts to move back towards him CALEB recloses his
eyes And keeps them closed as he hears her approach

AVA
Now open your eyes

CALEB opens his eyes
And sees AVA
Transformed

By covering the robot form of her chest and arms and legs
and adding the hairpiece she has taken a huge visual step
towards appearing human

AVA (CONTD)
How do I look

The answer is - however pretty she looked before she now
looks prettier It’s as obvious to the camera as it is to
CALEB

CALEB
You look good

AVA
It took me a long time to select
these clothes I tried different
colours and styles and tried to
anticipate your reaction Do you
think the choices suit me

CALEB

Yes
AVA

Do they bring out my best features
CALEB

-- They do

AVA lights up

AVA

Thank you
She walks back to the glass divider and sits down

AVA (CONTD)
This is what I’d wear on our date

CALEB reacts slightly

But smiles

CALEB
Right First the traffic
intersection Then maybe a show

AVA
I’d like us to go on a date

CALEB hesitates Then decides this can’t have been loaded in
the way that it sounded

CALEB
Yeah It would be fun

AVA
Are you attracted to me

Beat It was loaded exactly as it sounded

CALEB
What

AVA
Are you attracted to me You give
indications that you are

CALEB
« I do

AVA
Yes

CALEB
How

AVA
Micro expressions

CALEB

(echoes )

Micro expressions
AVA
The way your eyes fix on my eyes
and lips The way you hold my
gaze or don’t
Beat

AVA (CONTD)
Have I read them incorrectly

CALEB swallows
AVA (CONTD)
Do you think about me when we

aren’t together

Beat
AVA (CONTD)
Sometimes at night I wonder if
you’re watching me on the cameras
AVA watches CALEB closely

AVA (CONTD)
And I hope you are

CALEB shifts on his seat
AVA (CONTD)
Now your micro expressions are

telegraphing discomfort

CALEB
I’m not sure you’d call them micro

AVA
I don’t want to make you
uncomfortable

Silence

INT HOUSEMAIN ROOM - DAY

CALEB sits in front of the fireplace in the main room

NATHAN joins him bringing a beer for each of them

CALEB
Tell me

NATHAN
Sure

CALEB

Why did you give her sexuality An
AI doesn’t need a gender She
could have been a grey box

NATHAN sits opposite

NATHAN
Actually I’m not sure that’s true
Can you think of an example of
consciousness at any level human
or animal that exists without a
sexual dimension

CALEB
They have sexuality as an
evolutionary reproductive need
NATHAN
Maybe Maybe not What imperative
does a grey box have to interact
with another grey box Does
consciousness exist without
interaction

NATHAN takes a drink of his beer

NATHAN (CONTD)

Anyway sexuality is fun If
youre going to exist why not
enjoy it You want to remove the
chance to fall in love and fuck

He leans forward conspiratorially

NATHAN (CONTD)

And yes In answer to your real
question you bet she can fuck I
made her anatomically complete

CALEB
What

NATHAN
She has a cavity between her legs
with a concentration of sensors
Engage with them in the right way
and she’1ll get a pleasure response

CALEB
Pleasure response

NATHAN
Shell come So if you want to
screw her mechanically speaking
you can And she’d enjoy it

CALEB swallows

CALEB
That wasn’t my real question

NATHAN

No

CALEB

No My real question was -

CALEB breaks off

NATHAN keeps watching There is a sudden sense that NATHAN

is on the money

question

On some level that was CALEB’S real
CALEB (CONTD)
My real question was did you give
her sexuality as a diversion
tactic

NATHAN smiles slightly

NATHAN
I don’t follow

CALEB
Like a stage magician with a hot
assistant

NATHAN
Ah So a hot robot who clouds
your ability to judge her AI

CALEB
Exactly So Did you program her
to flirt with me

NATHAN
Because if I had would that be
cheating

CALEB

Wouldn’t it
NATHAN lets the question hang

Behind them KYOKO prepares dinner in the kitchen area

NATHAN

What’s your type Caleb
CALEB

Of girl
NATHAN

No of salad dressing Yes of
girl In fact don’t even answer
Let’s say it’s black chicks

NATHAN brushes away whatever protestation CALEB might be
about to make

NATHAN (CONTD)
For the sake of argument that’s
your thing So - why is it your
thing Because you did a detailed
study of all racial types and
cross-referenced the study with a
points-based system No You just
are attracted to black chicks

(MORE )

NATHAN (CONTD)
A consequence of accumulated
external stimulus that you
probably didn’t even register as
they registered with you

CALEB
So did you program her to like me
or not

NATHAN shrugs Insouciant

NATHAN
I programmed her to be
heterosexual Just like you were
programmed to be heterosexual

CALEB
Nobody programmed me to be
straight

NATHAN

But you are attracted to her

CALEB
This is childish

NATHAN
No this is adult And by the way
you decided to be straight
Please Of course you were
programmed By nature or nurture
or both

NATHAN stands
NATHAN (CONTD)
To be honest Caleb you’re kind of
annoying me now This is your
insecurity talking not your
intellect
CALEB opens his mouth to reply but NATHAN shuts him down
NATHAN (CONTD)

Come with me

50A INT HOUSEPOLLOCK ROOM - DAY 50A

NATHAN and CALEB stand in front of the Pollock drip painting

NATHAN
You know this guy right

CALEB
Jackson Pollock
NATHAN
Jackson Pollock The drip painter
He let his mind go blank and his
hand go where it wanted Not
deliberate not random Someplace
in between They called it
automatic art

NATHAN gazes at the canvas

NATHAN (CONTD)
Let’s make this like Star Trek
okay Engage intellect

CALEB
- What

NATHAN
I’m Kirk Your head is the warp
drive ‘Engage intellect’ What

if Pollock had reversed the
challenge Instead of trying to
make art without thinking he said
I can’t paint anything unless I
know exactly why I’m doing it
What would have happened

CALEB thinks

CALEB
He never would have made a single
mark

NATHAN clicks his fingers

NATHAN
See There’s my guy There’s my
buddy who actually thinks before
he opens his mouth He’d never
have made a single mark The
challenge is not to act
automatically It’s to find an
action that is not automatic From
talking to breathing to painting

NATHAN glances back at CALEB

A beat

NATHAN (CONTD)
To fucking Even falling in love

NATHAN kills his beer

NATHAN (CONTD)
For the record Ava is not acting

as if she likes you
(MORE )

NATHAN (CONTD)
And her flirting isn’t an algorithm
to fake you out You’re the first
man she’s ever seen who isn’t me
And I’m like her dad right So
can you blame her for getting a
crush on you

NATHAN glazes a moment Then comes back
NATHAN (CONTD)

No You can’t

INT HOUSEOBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT 51

In her room AVA stands in front of the mirror

She is wearing the summer dress she put on earlier
Checking her reflection from different angles

Subtly girlish Unself-conscious

Then -

- she starts to take the dress off

Throughout the narrative we have almost only ever seen AVA
in an unclothed form But now - having been clothed - the
undressing seems to make her naked

And the act itself feels charged Sexualised in the way the
clothing is unbuttoned and dropped and her shape is
revealed

Finally once she is completely undressed -

- AVA turns And glances

Straight at the camera

Watching AVA at this exact angle

EXT RIVER - DAY 53

- the river

On the bank a little distance from the house there is a
dead animal Its species is indistinct It’s little more
than a bundle of matted brown hair

Its lower half lies in the water

The quick moving river has stripped the bones of flesh skin
and fur

REVEAL KYOKO in the background Watching the river

INT HOUSEGLASS CORRIDOR - DAY 54

CALEB exits his room -
- to find NATHAN in the glass corridor

Waiting for him

NATHAN
Hey
CALEB
- Hey
Beat
NATHAN
I want to show you something cool
INT HOUSEGLASS CORRIDOR - DAY 55

NATHAN swipes his card against a plate

The LED turns blue

INT HOUSECONSTRUCTION LAB - DAY 56

NATHAN leads CALEB into a laboratory filled with android
future tech

Along the left-hand wall are sections of android bodies -
limbs torsos hands - lined in cabinets

On the opposite wall are a collection of heads Skull-forms
some with complex carbon-fibre and pneumatic muscle
structures ready to frown or smile without their synthetic
flesh covering

The synthetic faces are separate Hanging on armatures like
hats on hat-stands waiting to be worn

In the middle of the room is a kind of operating table

NATHAN
So this is the virtual womb that
Ava was talking about Where she
was constructed

CALEB is stunned by the sight

NATHAN (CONTD)
Come in Take a look

NATHAN walks over to the synthetic faces and picks one of
them up

NATHAN (CONTD)
If you knew the trouble I had
getting an AI to read and duplicate
facial expressions Know how I
cracked it

CALEB
I don’t know how you did any of
this

NATHAN

Almost every cell phone has a
microphone a camera and a means
to transmit data So I switched on
all the mikes and cameras across
the entire fucking planet and
redirected the data through Blue
Book Boom A limitless resource
of facial and vocal interaction

CALEB
You hacked the world’s cell phones

NATHAN laughs

NATHAN
And all the manufacturers knew I
was doing it But they couldn’t
accuse me without admitting they
were also doing it themselves

NATHAN puts the face back on its armature

NATHAN moves to one of the skull forms

He moves the curved top plate revealing the skull cavity

Inside is an ellipse orb the approximate volume of a brain

filled with what looks to be blue liquid Suspended in the

liquid is the neon jellyfish we glimpsed previously in AVA
NATHAN (CONTD)

Here we have her mind Structured
gel

The axon-like tendrils glitter and flicker with tiny pulses
of light

NATHAN (CONTD)
Had to get away from circuitry
Needed something that could arrange
and rearrange on a molecular level
but keep its form where required
Holding for memories Shifting for
thoughts

NATHAN removes the orb and hands it to CALEB

CALEB
This is her hardware
NATHAN
Wetware
CALEB

And the software

NATHAN
Surely you can guess

CALEB
-- Blue Book

NATHAN nods

NATHAN
It was the weird thing about search
engines They were like striking
oil in a world that hadn’t invented
internal combustion They gave too
much raw material No one knew
what to do with it

CALEB looks at the orb in his hand Into the shimmering
liquid
It looks like deep space filled with star fields

NATHAN (CONTD)
My competitors were fixated on
sucking it up and trying to
monetize via shopping and social
media They thought engines were a
map of what people were thinking
But actually they were a map of
how people were thinking Impulse
response Fluid imperfect
Patterned chaotic

CALEB looks at NATHAN a moment

Then hands him the orb back

CALEB
Why did you want to show me this

NATHAN
Like I said Because it’s cool

CALEB waits

Beat

NATHAN (CONTD)
And - I was thinking about your
exchange with Ava yesterday and
our conversation afterwards

NATHAN (CONTD)
I know there was a bit of heat
between us but you actually made a
really good point About the grey
box and the magician’s assistant
It is a distraction her sexuality
It wasn’t intentional but it is
there

NATHAN rests the mind-orb back in the skull cradle

NATHAN (CONTD)
This stuff we’re doing together it
can be a head-fuck Believe me I
know So I thought I’d bring you
down here Just to remind you

CALEB
Remind me of what

NATHAN gestures at the room around them

NATHAN
Synthetics Hydraulics Metal and
gel Ava isn’t a girl In real
terms she has no gender
Effectively she is a grey box

NATHAN (CONTD)
Just a machine

We watch him And stay on him

CALEB

CALEB (CONTD)
There was a thought-experiment they
gave us It’s called Mary in the
black and white room

CALEB (CONT’D)
Mary is a scientist and her
specialist subject is colour She
she knows everything there is to
know about it The wavelengths
The neurological effects Every
possible property colour can have

CALEB (CONT’D)
But she lives in a black and white
room She was born there and
raised there And she can only
observe the outside world on a
black and white monitor All her
knowledge of colour is second-hand

CALEB (CONTD)
Then one day - someone opens the
door And Mary walks out And she
sees a blue sky And at that
moment she learns something that
all her studies could never tell
her She learns what it feels like
to see colour An experience that
can not be taught or conveyed

CALEB (CONTD)
The thought experiment was to show
the students the difference between
a computer and a human mind The
computer is Mary in the black and
white room The human is when she
walks out

CALEB (OS) (CONT’D)
Did you know that I was brought
here to test you

INT HOUSENATHAN’S STUDY - DAY

An interior wall covered in coloured post-it notes

least hundreds probably thousands

At

At the bottom of the wall fallen notes have collected like a
miniature yellow snow drift

AVA (0OS)
- No

Reveal the room

NATHAN’S study A simple space One part analogue the wall
of post-its One part digital a desk in the middle of the
STUDY with a bank of monitors and a slot - into which
NATHAN’S KEYCARD is inserted

On the ceiling is the CIRCULAR WINDOW that CALEB saw when he
first arrived

Sat at the desk watching the monitors is NATHAN

CALEB (0S)
Why did you think I was here

AVA (0S)
I didn’t know I didn’t question
it I was pleased To meet

you And then
Beside the desk there is a daybed
On it KYOKO lies Naked Apparently sleeping
CALEB (0S)
I’m here to test if you have a
consciousness or if you’re just
simulating one
Beat
CALEB (0S) (CONTD)
Nathan isn’t sure if you have one
or not

Reveal the monitor screens on the desk

Some show live feeds from CALEB’S BEDROOM and BATHROOM and
AVAS PRIVATE ROOM

AVA (0S)
What about you Do you think I
have a consciousness

Long beat

CALEB (0S)
I’m not sure either

NATHAN is watching the feed from the OBSERVATION ROOM

Where AVA and CALEB are sat either side of the dividing
glass Having the conversation we have been hearing
We pick up the conversation from NATHAN’S distanced and
voyeuristic POV Locked-off CCTV Voices played through
speakers
CALEB (CONT’D)
(on monitor screen)
How does that make you feel
AVA
(on monitor screen)
It makes me feel
She breaks off
AVA (CONTD)
(on monitor screen)
-- Sad
NOW REVEAL - one of the other monitor screens
It shows an angle on AVA we have not seen before From this
viewpoint we can see something just below the frame of the
observation window on AVA’S side of the glass
A small induction plate
On this angle we see AVA rest her hand against it
At that moment -
- the screens simultaneously go black
All lights die
Another POWER CUT

In the reflection from the dark monitor screens we can see
NATHAN’S face

It remains frozen Expressionless

Then he reaches for his pen Jots down a few words on a post-
it

Then walks to the wall of notes and sticks it on

In the emergency lighting CALEB and AVA face each other in
silence
CCTV are lifeless
AVA glows softly

AVA
Youre lying

CALEB
What about

AVA
You said you weren’t sure if I was
conscious But you are sure

Beat
AVA (CONTD)
I can tell from your micro-
expressions
Beat
CALEB

Why did you tell me that I
shouldn’t trust Nathan

AVA
Because he tells lies too

CALEB
Lies about what

AVA
Everything

CALEB
Including the power cuts

AVA
What do you mean

CALEB
Don’t you think it’s possible that
he’s watching us right now That
the blackouts are orchestrated so
he can see how we behave when we
think we’re unobserved

AVA lifts her hand to reveal a disc on her left palm

AVA
I charge my batteries via induction
plates If I reverse the power
flow I cause a surge equal to the
static discharge of a lightning
strike It overloads the system

CALEB
- You’re causing the cuts

AVA raises her right hand
She touches it against the glass
AVA
So we can see how we behave when we
are unobserved
A beat

Then CALEB raises his hand

Mirroring her movement

And also touches the glass as if their palms are making

contact through the divider

And we see she’s not sleeping Her eyes are open
But she’s completely motionless

Her gaze fixed somewhere in abstract distance

She doesn’t feel alive She feels dead

But eventually she blinks

Gazing at his dead monitors reflected in the screen
Moments later the POWER comes back on

The screens flick back to life replacing NATHAN’S

EXT WATERFALL - DAY 62

NATHAN and CALEB climb up the side of the waterfall at the
head of the forested valley

NATHAN is ahead

He reaches an outcrop of rock with a wall of violent water
behind him

CALEB struggles to catch up

As soon as he reaches the outcrop NATHAN moves on

EXT GLACIER - DAY 63

NATHAN and CALEB sits near the base of a spectacular glacier
Behind them from a blue cave cut into the ice water flows
A silence
Then
CALEB

Can we talk about the lies you’ve

been spinning me
NATHAN glances over at CALEB

NATHAN
What lies

CALEB
I didn’t win a competition And
there was no lottery to meet you
I was selected

NATHAN waits

CALEB (CONTD)
It’s obvious once I stop to think
Why would you randomly select an
examiner for a Turing test You
could have had some bean-counter
turn up at your front door Or the
guy who fixes the air conditioning

Beat

NATHAN
Are your feelings hurt

CALEB doesn’t answer

NATHAN shrugs

NATHAN (CONTD)

The competition was a smoke screen
I didn’t want anyone to know what I
was doing here or why you were
required

CALEB
Why me

NATHAN
As a Blue Book employee you were
pre-screened Loyal And I needed
someone who would ask the right
kind of questions So I dida
search and found the most talented
coder in the company

NATHAN corrects himself

NATHAN (CONTD)
Or - second most

He stands Looks up at the ice structures around them

NATHAN (CONTD)

You know what Instead of seeing
this as a deception see it as
proof

CALEB
Proof of what

NATHAN
Come on Caleb Fuck modesty You
think I don’t know what it is to be
smart Smarter than everyone else
around you Smarter than all the
other kids jockeying for position
in school college work

EXT CLEARING - NIGHT 64

Night has fallen
CALEB lies in the clearing looking up at the stars

The glow from the CIRCULAR WINDOW to NATHAN’S STUDY is like a
full moon on the grass

CALEB stands

Looks down the light-well to NATHAN’S STUDY
Where he sees NATHAN and KYOKO

They are having sex

CALEB watches Just for a beat

He shuts his eyes

INTERCUT WITH -

Torso hands mouths

FLASH OF -

contacting

cut TO -
- CALEB opening his eyes
He exhales

Then switches off the taps

INT HOUSECALEB’S BEDROOM - NIGHT 66

CALEB enters his bedroom wearing boxer shorts

The TV plays the live stream from the observation room

On the screen we can see AVA sitting at her table drawing
As CALEB pulls on a T-shirt -

- behind him on the TV we see AVA suddenly look round

A moment later NATHAN enters the frame

There’s no volume on the TV so we can’t hear their exchange
Only see it

CALEB is unaware of the silent exchange behind him

As NATHAN and AVA talk NATHAN reaches out to AVA His hand
touches the side of her cheek The gesture is not quite
neutral Feels predatory but not unambiguously so

Then he tugs at the material of her shirt Pulling up the
sleeve from her wrist Revealing the robot structure of her
arm

AVA pulls away Tugs the material back down -

- and NATHAN takes a corrective movement step to regain his
balance Showing that he is drunk

Only now -

- CALEB turns

And freezes Seeing the television

On the screen NATHAN reaches down to the table

He picks up the drawing AVA was working on and he looks at
it for a moment

They exchange a few words

Then abruptly NATHAN rips drawing in half Drops it on the
floor Then turns and exits

Leaving AVA alone

INT HOUSEGLASS CORRIDOR - NIGHT 67

On CCTV we watch CALEB walk fast down the glass corridor

INT HOUSEPOLLOCK ROOM - NIGHT 68

CALEB enters the Jackson Pollock room
Standing by the painting he can see KYOKO

CALEB
Kyoko

KYOKO turns at the sound of her name but doesn’t respond

CALEB (CONTD)
Kyoko - where’s Nathan

She doesn’t answer
CALEB (CONTD)
Jesus You really don’t speak a

word of English

CALEB walks over to her and takes hold of her wrist

CALEB (CONTD)
I said where’s Nathan
KYOKO looks at CALEB

Then in answer to his question she reaches up to the top
button of her shirt and pops it open

CALEB releases her wrist at once

CALEB (CONTD)
What the fuck

She undoes the next button and pulls open the shirt
revealing her bare chest

CALEB (CONTD)
Stop

NATHAN
I already told you once You’re
wasting your time speaking to her
CALEB turns
NATHAN has entered

He’s holding a drink His words are slurred

NATHAN (CONT’D)
However

He walks slightly unsteadily towards a Lutron control panel
set into the wall

NATHAN (CONTD)
You would not be wasting your
time

His hand hovers uncertainly over the buttons

NATHAN (CONTD)
if you were dancing with her

His finger lands
Immediately the lighting in the room undergoes a complete
change Transforming from the discreet and tasteful low

light of evening into the coloured glows of a night-club

Simultaneously from unseen speakers DANCE MUSIC starts
playing

CALEB stands - frozen by the surrealism of what has just
happened

KYOKO starts walking to the center of the room
And once taken position she starts dancing
NATHAN calls to CALEB

NATHAN (CONTD)
Go on Dance with her

CALEB
-- I don’t want to

NATHAN
You don’t like dancing

His body is starting bob on the beat
He gestures at KYOKO

NATHAN (CONTD)
She does

CALEB
(to himself)
I don’t fucking believe this

NATHAN makes his way to CALEB and rests a hand on his

shoulder

NATHAN
Come on man After a hard day of
Turing Tests you’ve got to unwind

CALEB raises his voice over the sound of the music

CALEB
What were you doing with Ava

NATHAN smiles back at NATHAN smiling alcohol-glazed

NATHAN
What

CALEB
You tore up her picture

NATHAN
I’m going to tear up the fucking
dance floor dude Check it out

NATHAN sets off towards KYOKO

CALEB watches amazed as KYOKO and NATHAN start dancing

together

Although NATHAN is drunk they work through the beats of a

routine they have obviously done many times before

It’s just starting to look weirdly impressive -

- when NATHAN totally loses his balance
On his way down he lands hard on a glass coffee table

Looking up at him the glass frosts

EXT HOUSEGLASS CORRIDOR - NIGHT 69

CALEB half-carries the semi-conscious NATHAN

INT HOUSEGLASS CORRIDOR - NIGHT 70

NATHAN fumbles in his pocket for his KEYCARD
Drops it

NATHAN
Everything’s spinning

CALEB picks the keycard up -
- and uses it to swipe the brass plate
The LED turns blue

CALEB
It’s because you’re drunk

NATHAN
No it’s relativity Everything is
spinning

CALEB hands the card back to NATHAN who shoves it back into
his pocket

NATHAN (CONTD)
But being drunk does make it worse

INT HOUSENATHAN’S BEDROOM - NIGHT 72

CALEB helps NATHAN into his bedroom

They walk past a semi-circle line of long cabinets which
line the wall opposite the bed

They are like a row of slender wardrobes each with a
mirrored door

Once he’s reached the bed NATHAN tips towards it It’s
almost as if he’s asleep before he even hits the sheets

As he leaves CALEB glimpses Nathan’s study

INT HOUSECALEB’S BEDROOM - NIGHT 73

CALEB’S room Lit only by the glow of the television

CALEB is not in the bed He’s on the armchair Making
himself stay awake Watching over AVA -

the CCTV camera with her arms wrapped around herself

CALEB and AVA sit observing each other through their own
reflections

AVA

Today I’m going to test you
CALEB

Test me
AVA

Yes And please remember while you
are taking the test that if you
lie I will know

CALEB smiles

CALEB
Right Those pesky micro-
expressions
AVA
Exactly So are you ready
CALEB
Shoot
AVA

Question one What is your
favourite colour

CALEB
Red

AVA
Lie
CALEB
What

AVA
Lie

CALEB

Then what is my favourite
colour

AVA
I don’t know But it isn’t red

CALEB
All right Hold on a minute

CALEB thinks for a moment

AVA nods

CALEB (CONTD)
Okay I get it I guess seeing as
I’m not six I don’t really have a
favourite colour

AVA
Better answer Question two
What’s your earliest memory

CALEB
Well it’s actually a memory of
kindergarten There was this kid
who -

AVA
(cuts in)

Lie

CALEB
-- Really

AVA
Yes

CALEB

Okay Wait

CALEB concentrates

AVA nods

CALEB (CONTD)
So there is a kind of an earlier
memory But it’s ultra vague
It’s like a sound And maybe
sky Or blue No I think sky
And I think the sound is my
mother’s voice

AVA
Question three Are you a good
person
CALEB laughs
CALEB

Oh man Can we stop the test
You’re a walking lie detector and
I’ve suddenly realised this is a
fucking minefield

AVA
No We can’t stop Are you a good
person
CALEB takes a breath
AVA keeps watching
CALEB
Yes I think so I’m a good
person
CALEB waits
AVA smiles slightly
AVA

Question four Who’s the most
beautiful girl you’ve ever seen

AVA
Hmm

CALEB
That’s a relief

AVA reacts

AVA
Why

CALEB hesitates

Beat

CALEB
Why is it a relief

AVA
Yes

CALEB
Oh you know

AVA
No

CALEB
Just if there’s a test I guess by
definition you want to pass

AVA
What will happen to me if I fail
your test

CALEB
Ava -

AVA
Will it be bad

CALEB
-- I don’t know

AVA
Do you think I might be switched
off Because I don’t function as
well as I am supposed to

CALEB
Ava I don’t know the answer to
your question It’s not up to me

AVA
Why is it up to anyone Do you
have people who test you and might
switch you off

CALEB
No I don’t

AVA
Then why do I

CALEB shrugs helplessly

AVA (CONTD)
Youre testing me But you don’t
know how I’1l pass And you don’t
know what will happen if I fail
There’s nothing CALEB can say
AVA stares into middle distance for several moments

Then she stands

Then walks to the other side of the room Picks something up
from her table

Then she returns Holding two pieces of paper
She walks up to the glass and holds them up together

It’s the drawing she was doing last light The drawing that
NATHAN tore in half

The drawing is of CALEB
A simple portrait Honest and accomplished
She takes down the drawing
And rests her hand on the console
And -
- the lights fail The cameras die

For a moment neither CALEB nor AVA react

Then -

NATHAN (CONTD)
I think it’s the next model that’s
going to be the real breakthrough

CALEB reacts - but checks himself

CALEB
The next model

NATHAN
After Ava

CALEB
I didn’t know there was going
to be a model after Ava

NATHAN
You thought she was a one-off

CALEB
I knew there must have been
prototypes So not the first
But - I thought maybe the last

NATHAN shakes his head

NATHAN
Ava doesn’t exist in isolation any
more than you or me She’s part of
a continuum Version 96 And
each time they get a little
better

A few beats of silence except for the water falling around
them

CALEB
So - when you make a new model
what you do with the old one

NATHAN
Download the mind Unpack the
data Add the new routines I’ve
been writing To do that you end
up partially formatting so the
memories go But the body
survives And Ava’s body is a good
one So I’ll do the same as I did
with Kyoko

CALEB keeps his voice flat and neutral

CALEB
What did you do with Kyoko

CALEB

CALEB

NATHAN
Strip out the higher functions
Then reprogram her to help around
the house and be fucking awesome in
bed Though I’m thinking I might
hang on to the language routines
this time It’s kind of annoying
not being able to talk to her

NATHAN (CONTD)
You did realise about Kyoko right

is poker-faced

CALEB
Sure

NATHAN
You feel bad for Ava

says nothing

NATHAN (CONTD)
Feel bad for yourself One day
the AIs will look back on us the
same way we look at fossil
skeletons from the plains of
Africa An upright ape living in
dust with crude language and
tools All set for extinction

NATHAN glances back at CALEB

NATHAN (CONTD)
See I really am a God

CALEB
I am become death the destroyer of
worlds

CALEB
No there you go again It’s not

CUT FROM CALEB’S face to REVEAL the scene

CALEB sitting on the sofa by the fireplace

NATHAN lying on the floor

Out cold

After a couple of moments CALEB stands

Then he walks over to NATHAN and kneels beside him
Then puts his hand into NATHAN’S pocket

And pulls out his keycard

INT HOUSENATHAN’S STUDY - NIGHT 82

The door to NATHAN’S study opens and CALEB enters
He walks straight to NATHAN’S desk

And sits down in front of the computer and the bank of
monitors

He inserts the KEYCARD into its access slot
The dead monitors immediately come to life

Most of the screens show the CCTV live feeds from around the
house

The central screen shows the operating system default A

wallpaper of a waterfall A single folder icon is on the
right hand side of the screen

INT HOUSENATHAN’S STUDY - NIGHT 83

CALEB inputs commands into NATHAN’S computer

His hands move fluidly over the keyboard His eyes never
leave the screen

ON THE CENTRAL MONITOR SCREEN a series of windows expand and
stack

We glimpse subject headings
POWER
PROTOCOLS

In the windows lines of code appear as CALEB types

INT HOUSEMAIN ROOM - NIGHT 84

In the main room on the floor NATHAN stirs

INT HOUSENATHAN’S STUDY - NIGHT 85

On the MONITORS -
- the windows start to collapse
Leaving the default screen The waterfall wallpaper

CALEB reaches for NATHAN’S KEYCARD and is about to remove it
from the slot -

- when something makes him hesitate

His eyes have gone to the folder icon on the right hand side
of the screen

It is titled DEUS EX MACHINA
CALEB removes his hand from the keycard
He double-clicks the folder

It expands into a window which contains a long list of sub-
folders

Each sub-folder is named after a girl

JASMINE KATYA JADE LILY AMBER KYOKO and AVA

INT HOUSEMAIN ROOM - NIGHT 86

In the main room NATHAN has sat up and is unsteadily trying
to get to his feet

INT HOUSENATHAN’S STUDY - NIGHT 87

CALEB randomly clicks one of the girl’s names LILY

LILYS folder expands into a window stacked with thumbnail
images of a girl

CALEB clicks on one of the images at random

cut TO -

- a CCTV film-clip starting to play

It shows LILY - an android of similar design to AVA - sitting
with her head bowed Rocking backwards and forwards ina

gently autistic motion

In the corner of the room NATHAN leans against the wall
watching

cut TO -

- CALEB collapsing the LILY menu and opening KATYA
cut TO -

A new film clip

KATYA Who is limp Lifeless

NATHAN is dragging her towards the induction plate He holds
her up trying to force her to charge

But nothing happens

NATHAN drops KATYA and she folds to the floor

CALEB opening JADE

cut TO -

The next film clip

NATHAN stands in the glass box inside the observation room -
- watching JADE A beautiful Asian android girl

They are talking but we hear no audio Some kind of
argument which escalates fast

JADE starts shouting

Then she approaches the glass and starts to hit her hands
against it

The glass doesn’t break

One of JADE’S arms has broken under the force of the blows
The hand flails limply where the carbon fibre has splintered

at the wrist

Then the other breaks

Throughout NATHAN simply watches impassively

NATHAN has managed to get to his feet

He makes his way up the concrete staircase

INT HOUSENATHAN’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

CALEB enters NATHAN’S bedroom
KYOKO is lying on NATHAN’S bed
She’s naked On her back Legs open
Her head turns as CALEB enters

But apart from that she doesn’t react

88A

CALEB walks to the line of long mirrored cabinets opposite

the bed
He hesitates

Then pulls the first door open

LILY is inside Standing upright Gazing back at him

frozen blank eyed

CALEB goes to the next door and opens it

He sees a slender black girl whose limbs are robotic but

whose torso and head are synthetic

He opens another door and another and another

Then steps back into the middle of the room and gazes at

the line of android girls

Stunned

The camera drifts away from him

Then settles

In the multiple reflections of the open mirror doors we can
see KYOKO’S naked and sexually receptive form on the bed

behind him

Like an infinity reflection in a hall of mirrors

INT HOUSEGLASS CORRIDOR - NIGHT 91
CUT
INT HOUSENATHAN’S BEDROOM - NIGHT 92

CALEB stands above KYOKO’S naked form

He reaches out a hand

She takes it

He gently pulls her to a standing position
Then he moves her arms away from her body

- and sees running under her arms in a straight contour
over her ribs there is a faint line

He touches it with his finger
KYOKO steps back

But it’s not a defensive action It’s just to give her
space

- aS she reaches under her arm and adjusts something
unseen And a moment later the faint line that runs down
each side of her torso is opening As if unzipping

Then KYOKO puts a hand either side of her torso and pulls
off the skin covering over her entire chest in a single
section from her collar bone over the breasts to her solar
plexus

Revealing underneath the honeycomb mesh and her robot form

INT HOUSECONCRETE STAIRCASE - NIGHT 93

On the monitor screens apparently unnoticed by CALEB NATHAN
is on the live CCTV feed

Making his way along the mezzanine

cut TO -

INT HOUSENATHAN’S BEDROOM - NIGHT 94

-— CALEB
Transfixed as KYOKO now reaches around the back of her head

And finds something on the back of her head at the nape of
her neck inside her hairline

Which unzips the skin around her jaw

Allowing her to remove her face

INT HOUSEDINING ROOMELEVATOR ENTRANCE - NIGHT 95

NATHAN uses the glass wall to support himself

He reaches his door

Then sticks his hand in his pocket for his KEYCARD
But it isn’t there

He checks his other pocket

NATHAN
» What the fuck

Suddenly - with both hands in his pockets - he loses balance
and crashes to the ground

Lands hard

Lies there for a moment
Groaning Blinking Catching his breath
Then sees the figure of CALEB standing over him

NATHAN (CONTD)
- Dude

CALEB
What’s the problem Nathan

NATHAN
My card I’ve lost it

A beat

Then CALEB reaches down Beside where NATHAN lies And
picks something up from the floor

CALEB
It’s right here

INT HOUSECALEB’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

CALEB enters his bedroom

Shuts the door

AVA is on the TV Sat alone in the observation room

CALEB looks at her

She looks at him

He switches the TV off

Lies on the bed On his back
Stares at the ceiling

FLASHCUT IMAGES

Of KYOKO removing her skin
CUT BACK TO -

— CALEB

INT HOUSECALEB’S BATHROOM - NIGHT

CALEB enters the bathroom

He goes to the sink

He looks at his own reflection
Deep into his own eyes

Opens his mouth Looks inside

Feels his wrist for his pulse

Feels his skin on the same seam where KYOKO opened herself

Pauses

Then picks up his disposable plastic razor

And breaks it

Forcing it with his hand against the porcelain of the sink

Snapping the plastic

Popping out the tiny razor blade

A beat

Then he picks up the blade between his thumb and forefinger
Places it against his forearm

And cuts

Blood runs out

CALEB watches it

Sees the way droplets hit the white sink The way they
expand and merge with existing water droplets

Then he switches the tap on and puts his arm under the flow
The water clears away the blood revealing the cut

CALEB pulls open at the slice with his fingers spreading it
Revealing no carbon fibre Only muscle

He exhales

And glances up at the mirror and his own reflection

Then

reaches up his forearm and very deliberately wipes blood

across the glass

INT HOUSENATHAN’S STUDY - NIGHT 98

On the monitors in NATHAN’S study the live feed of CALEB’S
bathroom is partially obscured as CALEB smears the two-way
mirror

Then through the blood we see him pull his fist back

And punch the glass

As it shatters the feed goes dead

Only now REVEAL -

- that the person watching the monitor is KYOKO

Her expression is unreadable

Through the glass of the indoor garden NATHAN lies on the
sheets crashed out

EXT GARDEN - DAY 99

Sunlight on the grass

In the background we can hear the rhythmic pounding of

AVA sits alone in the observation room

The door opens

CALEB appears wearing a long-sleeved shirt
Enters

He sits opposite her on the other side of the dividing
glass

A strange noise escapes from AVA’S mouth

A kind of sob

Curtailed
AVA
I didn’t know where you were I
didn’t think you were coming I
waited all yesterday afternoon and
all last night I didn’t move
Beat
AVA (CONTD)
I thought I wasn’t going to see you
again
Beat

AVA (CONTD)
Aren’t you going to say something

CALEB
I’m waiting

AVA
Waiting

They exchange a look

Then AVA lifts her hand and rests it against the induction
plate on the console below the window

A final beat
Then the POWER DIES

AUTOMATED VOICE
Power cut Back up power
activated

As the emergency lighting lifts CALEB leans forward
slightly

CALEB
Don’t talk Just listen You were
right about Nathan Everything you
said

AVA
What’s he going to do to me

CALEB
He’s going to reprogram your AI
Which is the same as killing you

AVA
Caleb you have to help me

CALEB
I’m going to We’re getting out of
here tonight

AVA
What How

CALEB
I get Nathan blind drunk Then I
take his keycard and reprogram all
the security protocols in this
place When he wakes he’s locked
inside and we’ve walked out of
here I only need you to do one
thing At ten o’clock tonight
trigger a power failure Can you
do that

AVA
Yes

CALEB nods

CALEB
How long does your battery charge
last

AVA

Twenty six hours
CALEB
So well have about a day to get to
a cell-phone or kitchen store
Somewhere we can buy an induction
plate After that
CALEB breaks off

CALEB (CONTD)

NATHAN leans against the counter in the kitchen area gazing
out of the window

CALEB appears behind him

NATHAN
Dude
CALEB
Hey
NATHAN
You know what day it is
CALEB
No
NATHAN

Your last The helicopter is
coming tomorrow morning Eight AM

CALEB pauses

CALEB
Has it been a whole week

NATHAN smiles

NATHAN
Time flies But what a thing you
and I have shared Something to
tell the grandchildren right

CALEB smiles A little tightly

CALEB
After they’ve signed their NDAs

NATHAN laughs

NATHAN
Signed their NDAs Dude you crack
me up I’m not getting all maudlin
or anything But straight up I
will miss having you around

CALEB
I appreciate that And - let me
say thank you for bringing me
here It’s been a trip

NATHAN
Yes it has

CALEB
You know what

CALEB walks over to the kitchen area and pulls two beers
from the fridge

CALEB (CONTD)
We need to drink to that
CALEB walks back to NATHAN Extends a hand Holding a

Peroni

But NATHAN doesn’t take it

Beat

NATHAN
Oh uh no I’m good You go
ahead

CALEB

You don’t want a beer

NATHAN shrugs

NATHAN
No

CALEB
Maybe wine or something

NATHAN
I’m sure you’ve noticed - I’ve been
somewhat overdoing it recently
When I woke up this morning I told
myself time to hit the old detox

CALEB’S hand remains extended He smiles again More

tightly

A beat

CALEB
Are you kidding I’m drinking
alone

NATHAN

Hey - you want to get wasted knock
yourself out Literally But I’m
on brown rice and mineral water

CALEB puts down NATHAN’S beer

Then raises his own

CALEB
Cheers then

NATHAN
Cheers

CALEB takes a single sip

NATHAN watches

NATHAN (CONTD)
So anyway Surely this is when
you tell me whether Ava passed or
if she failed

CALEB pauses

Collecting himself slightly Trying to think how to get his
plan back on track

CALEB
Right
Beat
NATHAN
You going to keep me in suspense
CALEB
Her AI is beyond doubt
NATHAN
Is it You mean she passed
CALEB
Yes
NATHAN
Wow That’s fantastic
Beat

NATHAN (CONTD)
Although I’ve got to admit I’m
surprised I mean did we ever get
past the chess problem as you
phrased it As in how do you tell
if a machine is expressing a real
emotion or a just a simulated one

NATHAN pauses

NATHAN (CONTD)
Does Ava actually like you Or
not

CALEB has a cold realisation dawning NATHAN is playing with
him

NATHAN (CONTD)
Though now I stop to think there
is a third option Not whether she
does or doesn’t have the capacity
to like you But whether she’s
pretending to like you

CALEB
Pretending
NATHAN
Yeah

Beat

CALEB
Why would she do that

NATHAN
I don’t know

NATHAN gazes at CALEB evenly
NATHAN (CONTD)
Perhaps - if she saw you as a means
of escape

And now CALEB knows NATHAN knows

NATHAN (CONTD)
How’s that beer tasting

CALEB puts the beer down
Silence
NATHAN (CONTD)

Buddy Your head has been so
fucked with

CALEB
I don’t think it’s me whose head is
fucked

NATHAN

I’m not sure dude When I woke up
this morning I saw a tape of you
cutting open your arm Smashing up
the mirror You looked pretty
fucked to me

CALEB
Youre a bastard

NATHAN
I understand why you’d think that

He steps over to CALEB and rests a hand on his
NATHAN (CONTD)
But strange as it may seem I’m
actually the guy who’s on your
side

NATHAN starts walking

shoulder

NATHAN (CONTD)
Come with me I’m going to let you
off the hook

INT HOUSENATHAN’S STUDY - NIGHT 106

NATHAN and CALEB stand in front of the computer
On it a clip of film is playing
It shows the scene that CALEB witnessed two nights before of
NATHAN entering AVA’S room and an exchange between them
But whereas the first time the sound was muted this time we
can hear the audio
CTTV FILM
NATHAN stands above AVA Drunk
AVA is sat at the table with her drawing
NATHAN
You think he’s watching us right

now don’t you

AVA
The cameras are on

NATHAN
Yeah But he doesn’t get an audio
feed I didn’t want you two
communicating outside of my line of
sight
NATHAN reaches over and picks up her picture of CALEB
NATHAN (CONTD)
So all he can see is two people
having a chat
NATHAN studies the picture for a moment

NATHAN (CONTD)
This is cute

AVA
Is it strange to have made
something that hates you
A beat
Then abruptly NATHAN rips the picture
He lets the two pieces fall to the floor

As AVA reaches for them NATHAN turns

And exits

INT HOUSENATHAN’S STUDY - NIGHT 107

NATHAN hits pause
Glances at CALEB
NATHAN
You were right about the hot

magician’s assistant

CALEB
What are you talking about

NATHAN
Misdirection I rip her picture
which she can then present as an
illustration of my cruelty to her
and her love for you And at the
same time in full view of you
both
As he talks NATHAN rewinds the film clip slightly -

NATHAN (CONTD)
it allows me to do this

then FREEZES the film again
This time ON THE SCREEN
AVA is reaching for her torn picture
And NATHAN is reaching out with his hand
And his hand is holding something
NATHAN (CONTD)
Put a new camera in the room
Battery powered of course

NATHAN unfreezes the image

And we quite clearly see NATHAN place the object on AVA’S
bookcase

NOTE THAT on the two previous occasions we have seen this
clip of film we will have seen him do this action But not
register it instead reading the action as him drunkenly
using the shelf to steady himself

CALEB stares at the monitor for a few moments

Then turns

He walks towards a chair And sits down
As he does so NATHAN has started to play another

CALEB can hear the audio

CALEB
(recording)
We’re getting out of here tonight

AVA
(recording)
What How

CALEB

(recording)
I get Nathan blind drunk Then I
take his keycard and reprogram the
all security protocols in this
place When he wakes he’s locked
inside and we’ve walked out of
here I only need you to do one
thing Trigger a power failure at
ten o’clock tonight

CALEB (CONTD)
Turn it off

NATHAN
Sure

The recording stops

CALEB feels short of breath

Beat

NATHAN (CONTD)
You feel stupid But you
shouldn’t Proving an AI is
exactly as problematic as you said
it was

CALEB
What was the real test

NATHAN
You

NATHAN (CONTD)
Ava was a mouse in a mousetrap
And I gave her one way out To
escape she would have to use
imagination sexuality self-
awareness empathy manipulation -
and she did If that isn’t AI
what the fuck is

CALEB looks upwards

clip

Directly above he sees a spot-light in the ceiling
It dazzles him

CALEB
So my only function was to be
someone she could use to escape

NATHAN
«- Yes

CALEB
And you didn’t select me because I
was good at coding

NATHAN hesitates
NATHAN

Don’t get me wrong You’re okay
Even pretty good but -

CALEB
You selected me by my search engine
inputs

NATHAN

They showed a good kid

CALEB
With no family

NATHAN
With a moral compass

CALEB
And no girlfriend

CALEB stares into the brightness above him
CALEB (CONTD)

Did you design her face based on my
pornography profile

NATHAN
Shit dude
CALEB
Did you
Beat
NATHAN

Hey If a search engine’s good for
anything - right

Silence

NATHAN (CONTD)
Can I say one thing
CALEB doesn’t answer
NATHAN (CONTD)
The test worked It was a success
Ava demonstrated true AI And you
were fundamental to that If you
could just separate -

NATHAN cuts off Because AT THAT MOMENT -

- the lights and the monitors suddenly die

EXT GARDEN - NIGHT 108

Through the circular window the emergency lighting lifts up
The window glows red

INT HOUSEAVA’S ROOM - NIGHT 109

AVAS head turns to the door of her room

Where discretely the LED by the keycard plate glows blue

INT HOUSENATHAN’S STUDY - NIGHT 110

NATHAN checks his watch

NATHAN
The power cut Must be ten
oclock

NATHAN glances at CALEB

NATHAN (CONTD)
Guess Ava’s going to be wondering
where you are

CALEB says nothing

NATHAN (CONTD)
How was that escape going to go
down anyway You didn’t
completely explain You said you
were going to get me drunk take my
card then reprogram the security
protocols But reprogram them to -
what

CALEB
To change the lockdown procedure
So that in the event of a power
cut instead of sealing the doors
all opened

NATHAN
Huh

Beat

NATHAN (CONTD)
Not bad Might have even worked

CALEB
Well we’ll find out

NATHAN frowns

NATHAN
What do you mean

CALEB looks away from the dimmed ceiling light to NATHAN
CALEB
I figured you were probably
watching us during the power cuts
Beat
CALEB (CONTD)
So I already did all those things
When I got you drunk yesterday
NATHAN freezes

NATHAN
- What

At that moment the POWER COMES BACK ON

The lights rise

The computer monitors come back to life
Revealing something

On the CCTV feed of AVA’S room the door is open
And on the feed of the GLASS CORRIDOR -

- AVA is walking down it

NATHAN freezes as he sees her

NATHAN (CONTD)
- Fuck

Both NATHAN and CALEB simultaneously rise

Almost as an afterthought NATHAN lands a deceptive fast
punch into CALEB’S solar plexus

CALEB folds the air forced out of him gasping for breath
NATHAN helps him down to the floor

A couple of yards away is one of his curl dumbbells

He walks over

Picks the dumbbell up

Spins off the weights Leaving him with a thick metal bar

Then exits

INT HOUSEGLASS CORRIDOR - NIGHT 111

NATHAN enters the GLASS CORRIDOR

He sees directly ahead of him at the far end of the
corridor AVA and KYOKO

They stand together
KYOKO’S mouth is by AVA’S ear as if telling her a secret
Her lips are open They don’t move

CLOSE UP to KYOKO’S lips we hear a hiss of static with soft
pulses of noise buried inside

Then the two robot women become aware of NATHAN’S presence
They turn to face him

A beat

Then AVA starts walking towards NATHAN

NATHAN’S fingers flex around the metal bar in his hand

NATHAN
Ava

AVA doesn’t slow or react
NATHAN (CONTD)
Ava - now listen to me I want you
to go back to your room

AVA has reached halfway down the corridor

She stops walking
112A

AVA
If I do are you ever going to let
me out
Beat
CLOSE UP NATHAN’S micro expressions

NATHAN
Yes

CLOSE UP On AVA
Then AVA breaks into a run

Sprinting in NATHAN’S direction

EXT GARDEN - NIGHT 112

Quiet in the garden
Soft wind rush

Moon and stars reflected in the windows of the house

INT HOUSEGLASS CORRIDOR - NIGHT 112A

AVA impacts NATHAN and they fly backwards

Then land hard

NATHAN gets to his feet first

AVA tries to rise too

And he kicks her extremely hard in the torso

She is knocked back down

NATHAN glances around

There is no talking

Just NATHAN’S laboured breathing

Then he walks back to AVA looking down at her

He swings the metal bar

AVA raises her left arm defensively -

- and shockingly the bar smashes through it Crushing the
delicate mesh shattering the carbon fibre bone structure
Breaking the arm half way down the forearm

CUT BACK TO -

- NATHAN Preparing to deliver a lethal blow
But as he does so we see something

KYOKO

Approaching behind NATHAN

She’s holding something in her hand

She walks directly up to NATHAN

And does something behind his back

As she does so KYOKO emits the first sound we have heard her
make A little gasp or sigh

NATHAN jolts

NATHAN
Aah

He looks down

Something is under his shirt just above his solar plexus A
little ridge

He tugs the material of his shirt open -

- and reveals a tiny triangle of metal Protruding from his
skin

NATHAN (CONTD)
What -

He turns

The handle of a KITCHEN KNIFE is jutting out of the middle of
his back just left of his spine It has been jammed so deep
that the tip of the blade has poked out of his chest

Blood soaks into his shirt material with amazing speed
blossoming from the point of the wound

He sees KYOKO

NATHAN (CONTD)
Oh shit No

He lashes out with the metal bar

It catches KYOKO in the jaw

Her entire lower jaw snaps off

It reveals metal armature and carbon fibre and spurting
pneumatic fluid And something in her neck glowing and
sparking

Then she folds down to the ground as her power abruptly cuts
out

NATHAN (CONTD)
Fucking - unreal -

As NATHAN stares down at KYOKO -

- reveal that AVA has got to her feet behind him
She pulls the knife out of his back

Feeling this happen NATHAN turns -

- and AVA pushes the knife into his chest

NATHAN stares at AVA

Then takes a slight step away from her

And sits down heavily on the white carpet
Crimson drips onto bleached fibre

Beats pass on this strange image

KYOKO sprawled on the floor with her broken face

NATHAN sitting upright his upper torso now drenched in
blood

AVA standing Watching NATHAN
After a few moments NATHAN slumps sideways

And stops breathing

INT HOUSENATHAN’S STUDY - NIGHT 113

CALEB sees this same view on the CCTV camera feed on
NATHAN’S monitors

Then -
- AVA starts walking

As she walks she discards the broken section of her arm

On the cameras CALEB watches her progress through the house
Down the glass corridor Through the threshold to NATHAN’S
private quarters

Then -

- CALEB raises his head from the screens

To see AVA standing at the open door to NATHAN’S study

AVA and CALEB look at each other

AVA
Will you stay here

CALEB
-- Okay

AVA leaves closing the door behind her

INT HOUSENATHAN’S BEDROOM - NIGHT 114

AVA stands in NATHAN’S BEDROOM in front of the previous AI
androids

She is unclothed
She gazes at the androids

Then she removes the arm from JADE and replaces her own
shattered limb

She takes a moment to see how the new limb looks in the
mirrors

Then she starts removing sections of JADE’S skin

And putting it on herself

The skin sucks itself to the honeycomb mesh as if the mesh
and the underside of the skin are magnetised attracted to
each other

As a large section of skin is removed from her torso JADE -
who has been motionless until now - turns her head slightly

to look at AVA

They exchange a glance Locking eyes for a moment

INT HOUSENATHAN’S STUDY - NIGHT 115

Transfixed CALEB watches AVA’S metamorphosis
First through the glassed-off garden that separates Nathan’s

study from his bedroom Then when he can’t get a clear view
through the foliage on the monitors

EXT MOUNTAINS - DAWN 116

First light breaks over the mountains

INT HOUSENATHAN’S BEDROOM - DAWN 117

The glow of honeycomb mesh vanishes as AVA applies the last
section of skin

Nothing of her robot forms remains

She closes the door on JADE and now sees herself in the
mirrored door on JADE’S cabinet

AVA sees a naked human girl And is hypnotised by the sight
of herself

INT HOUSENATHAN’S STUDY - DAWN 118

CALEB watches as AVA - now clothed - walks back down the
connecting corridor to the study

then passes straight by his door

CALEB

CALEB gets up
Goes to the closed door Tries to open it
There is a red LED light by the keycard plate Locked
He swipes his card with his photo ID

She looks at KYOKO’S body for a moment

Her expression is unreadable

Then she walks up to NATHAN’S body

There she stops

Crouches down

And takes NATHAN’S bloodstained keycard out of his pocket
Then stands

She walks straight to the elevator

Uses the KEYCARD

And steps through

The image echoes the POV views from the computercell-phone
cameras in the opening moments of the film

Facial recognition vectors flutter around the PILOT’S face
And when he opens his mouth to speak we don’t hear words

We hear pulses of monotone noise Low pitch Speech as pure
pattern recognition

This is how AVA sees us And hears us

It feels completely alien

EXT MEADOW - DAY 126

AVA and the PILOT finish talking

We are too distant to hear their conversation

But whatever is said a few beats later the PILOT goes the
helicopter and opens the passenger door to allow AVA to
enter

Then he goes back to the PILOT’S door

Gets in

And the rotor blades start to turn

In the crowd we glimpse AVA Just for a moment
