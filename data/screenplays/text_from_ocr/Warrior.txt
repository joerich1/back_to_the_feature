Paddy and Tommy walk through the front door The house is
clean yet all the furnishings are from the late 1970s

stands in the den and looks around breathing the old place
in as Paddy makes his way into the kitchen

TOMMY

place

The sound of glasses CLINKING in the kitchen as Tommy takes

off his watch cap and begins to look around his old home He
glances down at a BIBLE on a table beside a weathered Barca

lounge chair

TOMMY
Theres not much of a womans touch
around here

PADDY (0S)
No more women for me Tommy

TOMMY
Yeah Must be hard to find a girl
who can take a punch nowadays

Tommy takes another swig from his bottle and looks at a
series of old PHOTOGRAPHS lining the walls as Paddy walks
into the room carrying a coffee pot and saucers on an old
wicker tray Tommy looks at him incredulous

the bible then stares hard at Paddy

TOMMY

Tacoma And you were in the
Marines That was all That was

save her Did your man tell you

PADDY
Im sorry Tommy

TOMMY
Its good to know youre sorry
Pop Goes a long way

Paddy chokes up Tommy looks at him Closes his eyes

TOMMY (CONTD)
I think I liked you better when you
were a drunk

An overwhelmed Paddy sips his coffee and looks at Tommy who
is fading The pills are kicking in He tries to open his
eyes but its no use and after a few moments hes out

Paddy glances down where some pills have fallen out of
Tommys pocket and scattered on the rug He watches his son
Relieved and heartbroken at the same time

INT CENTRAL HIGH SCHOOL CLASSROOM PHILADELPHIA - DAY

Brendan stands in a classroom surrounded by high school
STUDENTS wearing safety goggles and raising cain A block of
wood sits wedged in a vice and a student TITO stands over
it with a Louisville slugger in his hands as his classmates
CHEER him on

BRENDAN
Whoa whoa whoa Theres a lesson in
this too OK Listen up So we have
a body at rest and you have the
bat which needs--

TITO
Acceleration

BRENDAN
Acceleration right If you have
enough acceleration you have might
have a chance to break the body at
rest OK Go ahead

Brendan sleeves rolled up and a bemused look on his face
watches as Tito brings the bat down on the wood As it

in half the other students cheer wildly Tito smiles and
leans the bat against a blackboard with NEWTONS 2nd LAW OF
MOTION printed on it

BRENDAN (CONTD)
There we go Alright Tito well
done Remind not to mess with you
Sit down everybody Dial it down

As Tito high-fives his way back through the group things
settle down and the kids take their seats

BRENDAN (CONTD)
So have we got it

A room full of affirmatives with the cocky voice of NASH a
skinny white kid in a Flyers jersey standing out

NASH
Force equals mass times
acceleration We got it

BRENDAN
Alright The third law--

A black student STEPHON looks up from his desk

STEPHON
How many laws this dude got

BRENDAN

(LAUGHING)
The dude The dude has three
Newton the dude says that for every
action theres an equal and
opposite reaction

Brendan looks toward the classroom door where two red-and-
white clad CHEERLEADERS are peering in then walks over to
KC a blonde cheerleader seated in his class She is working
a Blackberry and doesnt notice him approaching

BRENDAN (CONTD)
For example if KC does not stop
the action of sending texts in
class

Brendan stands directly in front of her desk She quickly
shoves the Blackberry under a stack of books

BRENDAN (CONTD)
and tell her posse outside to
beat it

He turns and shoos away the two cheerleaders peering in the
window

BRENDAN (CONTD)
then my reaction might be to
send her down to Principal Zitos
office Thus setting our world back
in proper balance

KC
Mr C I put it away

The class busts on KC as Brendan walks back to his desk and
sits on top of it Its clear from the vibe in the room that
hes a very popular teacher Then the BELL rings
bag

BRENDAN
Alright before you go I have your
tests from last week

to the chest Grimes staggers back and shakes it off

MAD DOG

does it again And again Then he DECKS HIM with a hard
right sending Mad Dog to the canvas to the shock of his
entourage and Colt Boyd

Within moments everyone in the gym stops what theyre doing
and watches as Tommy grabs the back of Mad Dogs head hauls
it down and launches knee after knee into his face

Tommy starts throwing Mad Dog around like a rag doll
striking him with vicious punches and kicks as Fenroy pulls
out his CELL PHONE and starts filming the action As Colt
Boyd screams at Mad Dog to cover up Tommy shoves him

the ropes and blasts away

on in there Finally he crushes Mad Dog with a vicious left

hook and sends him sprawling through the ropes UNCONSCIOUS

still remains who is this guy And
more importantly can he compete in
this talent pool Can he win

fact that I dont know is strange
In an internet age where there are

Tommy continues to storm toward the cage with a furious and

focused look on his face He seems to want nothing to do

You gotta love this guy Sam No
walk out music no sponsors no
interviews He skipped out on the
press conference Wouldnt have his
picture take for the program Hes
breaking every rule

SHERIDAN (VO)

The only reason that Tommy is even
in this tournament is because of a
video showing him beating up Mad
Dog Grimes in the gym

CALLEN (VO)

But the reason a lot of his fans
are in the stands is because of
another video which is even more
stunning than the Mad Dog Grimes
video Let me describe it for you
folks for the few who havent seen
it and I dont know anyone who
hasnt but Tommy Riordan ripped
the door off a tank in the heat of
battle saving lives in the
process and then walked away
without claiming a medal He ripped
the door off a tank

In the crowd two sections of MARINES in full dress uniforms
wave flags and raise about as much hell as humanly possible
for Tommy who returns to his corner Paddy attempts to give
him some advice but Tommy is not listening

CALLEN (V0O)

SHERIDAN (V0O)

JJ Riley had less than 48 hours

to fill Marco Santos spot and he
basically had to rely on the word

of Frank Campana

CALLEN (V0O)

And he chose Brendan Conlon which
quite frankly is something I just
dont understand

Brendan and Frank walk down the tunnel toward the arena
where Paddy is waiting his All Access pass around his neck
Brendan notices the old man as he approaches

PADDY
Go get ‘em son
Brendan barely acknowledges Paddy and keeps walking Frank
looks at Brendan with a Who the hell is that expression
As they approach the dark lights of the arena Beethoven
continues to BOOM out over the loud speakers

CALLEN (V0O)

I can understand coming out to no
music by why in the world would
you choose classical music for your
entrance

SHERIDAN (VO)
This is Beethoven Bryan This is
Ode to Joy

CALLEN (V0O)
My apologies Mr Renaissance man

SHERIDAN (VO)

You want to talk about renaissance
men you gotta talk about Frank
Campana Very unorthodox trainer
and one of the best in the game
Hes well known for using classical
music to train his fighters to
remain calm to remain patient and
to remain composed under pressure

Brendan and Frank make their way through the crowd and
toward
cageside where Bryan Callen reaches beneath his seat

CALLEN
Classical music is about as fitting
to this setting as Brendan Conlon
is to this tournament In fact let
me show you something

Callen holds up a plastic bag with water and a GOLDFISH
inside

CALLEN (CONTD)

feeder fish and hes about to get
dropped into a shark tank
