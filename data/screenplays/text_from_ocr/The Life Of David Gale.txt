FADE IN
EXT TWO-LANE HIGHWAY - SUNRISE

A dishevelled WOMAN in a business suit runs down a

lonely

highway in Texas hill country moving desperately
through

the thick morning fog Shes carrying a VHS cassette
The

sounds of her breathing and SHOES HITTING the PAVEMENT
ECHO

into the mist

She runs and runs

She slows out-of-strength looks up and down the
highway

Both in front and behind it leads straight into the
mist a

tunnel of fog She stumbles on a final effort

She runs Sees something Stops cold

minutes

The office is small cheaply furnished One wall is

filled

with neat rows of 8x10s of death row inmates

About 30 percent have red crosses over their faces

Five people wait in tense silence A SKINNY COLLEGE GUY
with

a mullet and pinch of Skoal in his mouth looks at a
computer

screen A co-ed cuddles a Styrofoam cup of coffee sobs

quietly A matronly woman sits quietly at a desk
holding a

phone to one ear

The clocks minute hand changes from 11 to 12

the

reflection of the rising sun
BACK TO DAVID

DAVID

DAVID
Yo Officer

The cop looks over his face says he expects a
confrontation

Corrections would let him go Governor
Harding would go on TV say ‘Thanks

proof we could demand abolition
Just like happened in England Are
you okay

DAVID

Sorry Yeah

He makes an effort plays the good listener

CONSTANCE
But it hasnt happened not since
76 And wont happen

David nods

CONSTANCE
Dead men cant make a case

DAVID
And Almost Martyrs dont count

CONSTANCE
Just keep it rational The death
penalty is expensive and ineffective
No one wants to see a murderer as a
victim

DAVID
Um-hum

CONSTANCE
And stop that

DAVID
What

CONSTANCE
Active listening I hate active
listeners Makes me feel like Im
with a Dale Carnegie grad who cares
more about appearing to listen than

Welcome back to Batters Box
Tonight we continue our very special
four-part series with the Governor
Hardin Arguing capital punishment
with her is DeathWatch coordinator
Professor David Gale Governor youre

up

GOVERNOR HARDIN
Alan let me say somethin I always
say

Constance stands behind the cameras She motions to
David --
something about the papers in front of him

GOVERNOR HARDIN
And Im gonna keep on sayin And
that is I hate killin Thats why
my administration is willing to kill
to stop it

DAVID
So you dont subscribe to the idea
that a good state is one that
protects its most despised members

GOVERNOR HARDIN
Its a nice liberal idea but like
most nice liberal ideas naive

DAVID
Its a quote from you Governor
from your first state attorney
campaign

Constance is biting her lip breaks into a smile The
Governor

is unsure how to react then laughs The host chuckles
with

her

GOVERNOR HARDIN
Youve got me Professor But let
me in my defense give you a quote
Winston Churchill If youre not a
liberal at twenty youve got no
heart if youre still a liberal at
thirty youve got no brain

The hosts laughter is overdone David smiles
Constance
bites her lip

DAVID
So basically you feel to choose
another quote society must be
cleansed of elements which represent
its own death

The Governor makes an animated thinking face
Governor

tone

this

Constance

GOVERNOR HARDIN
Well yes I would have to agree
(chuckles again)
Did I say that too

DAVID
No maam That was Hitler

makes a Yes gesture with her hands The

is surprised into silence The host laughs and noti

reaction

trails off David becomes more confident

more sincere

DAVID
Governor cant we examine the
possibility that capital punishment
isnt working That murderers arent
deterred by the law because they
have about as much forethought as
lemmings That its expensive
inequably administered that

David cuts his eyes briefly to Constance

Constance

DAVID
that we may even be killing
innocents

rolls her eyes The Governor is ready for

GOVERNOR HARDIN
All righty Mr Gale Ill play your
game Name one Name one innocent
man Texas has put to death in my

DAVID
(indicating the station)
Look I wanted you to do this anyway

CONSTANCE
You put up precisely two seconds of
protest at the thought of a televised
debate

DAVID
Whats that supposed to mean

CONSTANCE
It means DeathWatch suffers because
youre so anxious to finger authority
to publicly prove that David Gale is
so much fucking smarter than the
powers that be Learn to work without
an audience Try squeezing money
from the donor list Have you ever
licked one single mail-out envelope

They come to the end of the sidewalk where two SUITS

BITSEY
Alright were off
DAVID
Constance was murdered with whats
called the Securitat Method Youre
hand-cuffed forced to swallow the
key taped at the mouth a bags
sealed over your head and youre
left to suffocate The Securitat did
this to Romanians who wouldnt inform
or confess Sometimes the bag was
ripped off at the last second you
got a second chance If not you die
knowing the key to your freedom
was inside you the whole time A
cheap-but-effective metonym Problem
is I mentioned the method in an early
article The prosecution never knew

BITSEY
Youre telling me someones framing
you

DAVID

Its more than that

DAVID
There was a tripod

BITSEY
Right facing her body Are we on

DAVID
(nods agreement)

Not a single print was found on it
Someone brought it wiped it left
it Why Its as if they wanted me
to know that somewhere theres a
record of what really happened that
afternoon As if they wanted me to
die knowing the key to my freedom
was out there

BITSEY
Maybe youre being paranoid

would take the fall

BITSEY

Oh my God Zack thats it Thats
why To prove it happens To have
absolute proof that the system
convicts innocents

ZACK
Get the fuck out of here

BITSEY
No thats how she thought She lived
for DeathWatch If shes gonna die
why not die for it Thats why the
tripod was here To record proof
undeniable proof the tape Thats
why we got an out-take

conviction after a year or so You
know force him to dry out let him
play the heroic victim give him
back his dignity So Dusty Wrights
sitting on this tape waiting the
only one who knows about it And
maybe good ole Dusty starts to think
that an erroneous execution is a
hell of a lot more politically useful
than a last-minute save

Which would only prove the system
works
