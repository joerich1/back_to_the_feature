Scene 12 Interior Day Dining Room

1 ED - W

Something evil is lurking deep withing the wooded moun-
tains of Tennessee and the camera takes its point of
view Rising from a swampy bog the mud slides from view
allowing it to see early morning mist hanging about the
forest Creeping silently past trees gliding over small
shrubs it moves onward through the woods until a mammoth
oak rests directly in its path The tree is uprooted by
this unseen force and falls with a deafening crash

2 ED - CAR

Near by a stretch of highway curves along the base of

a mountain The road winds off into oblivion beyond other
peaks From behind view the rumble of an engine can be
heard It is a large logging truck headed south Moving
away the truck becomes smaller until finally it disap-
pears in the distance From where the truck emerged a
dilapidated gold 1973 Oldsmobile comes into view

3 ID - CAR

Inside five people can be seen They are couples ASHLY
and LINDA SCOTT and SHELLY and CHERYL ASHLYs sister
Both SCOTT and SHELLY wear Michigan State T-shirts
and are students along with the others at that univer-
sity SCOTT is driving and SHELLY sits next to him up
front ASHLY LINDA and CHERYL are in back They listen
to an old Baby Moses And The Thrillers song on the
radio and SHELLY is slapping the dash board as if it
were a drum

SHELLY
(Singing with the music) Together
forever

SCOTT

Ash where are we

ASHLY

Ill tell ya in a second Now were
still on seventy-five just past the
county border

ED - W

Once again the camera takes the point of view of the
dark and brooding force which stops atop a forest ridge
to peer downward Its view focuses upon the 1973 Olds-
mobile speeding along the narrow highway below

ID - CAR

ASHLY traces a route on the map with his finger

ASHLY

Which would put uswhich would
put us

SCOTT

Jesus Christ just tell us already
will ya

ASHLY zeroes in on the map with his finger

ASHLY

Right

SCOTT is growing impatient

ASHLY
Right

SCOTT
Yes

ASHLY
Here

Suddenly the radio stops and the steering wheel jerks
from SCOTTs hand

ED - CAR

The car screetches out of control into the opposite lane
A large oncoming tanker truck with its horn screaming
races toward the car on a collision coarse

ID - CAR

SHELLY

Scotty watch out

ED - CAR

The truck races closer

ID - CAR

Their steering wheel is locked

ASHLY

Turn

ED - CAR

At the last possible instant SCOTTs wheel again can
be controlled and the car swerves sharply back into its
own lane

ED - CAR

The truck speeds harmlessly past them

ID - CAR

ASHLY

Damn it Scott what the hell was that
You trying to kill us

SCOTT

Dont yell at me its your lousy
steering wheel The damn thing jerked
right out of my hand

ASHLY

I cant understand it I just had
this thing in for a tune-up

SHELLY

Radios dead too ace

ASHLY

And I just had em tune up the whole
thing yesterday

SCOTT

Well then take it back cause the
damn thing dont work Only thing
that works on the whole car is the
lousy horn

SCOTT honks the horn

ED - CAR

Several local MEN walking down the highway respond to
the horn by waving

ID - CAR

SCOTT yells out the window at them

SCOTT

Aw go to hell Im not waving at ya

He looks in the rear view mirror The MEN are still wav-
ing in the distance SCOTT turns back to drive
SCOTT

Jesus Christ

SHELLY turns around in the front seat and holds up a
pint of Scotch

SHELLY
Well Id like to make a toast To

Scott who almost killed us

SCOTT

Aw eat shit and die will ya

SHELLY and the others laugh

SHELLY

Okay okay- then to a wild week-end

in a wonderful cabin with good friends
(She glances at SCOTT) provided we
live that long

SHELLY cooly drinks from the Scotch and passes the bottle
back to ASHLY and LINDA ASHLY pours LINDA a drink in the
bottle cap and keeps the bottle They raise their drinks

ASHLY and LINDA
With good friends
They toast drink and react to the strong liquor ASHLY
tries to hide his reaction to the Scotch in front of
LINDA since SHELLY had reacted so calmly ASHLY passes
the bottle to CHERYL who stops him with a polite No
thank you then back up front to SCOTT
LINDA

Hey Scotty whats this place like
anyway

SCOTT

Well the guy thats renting it says
its an old place little run down
but its right up in the mountains-—
totally secluded (He takes a drink
from the bottle) Best part is we
get it so cheap

LINDA

Why are we getting it so cheap

SCOTT

I dont know might be in real bad
shape

CHERYL

You mean nobodys seen this place
yet

SCOTT

Not yet

ASHLY

Might not be too bad

LINDA

No

ASHLY

Actually it might be very nice

LINDA

Yeah

SHELLY

Its probably a real pit

CHERYL
I cant believe that were renting

a place for a week-end that nobodys
seen

SCOTT

(Mumbling to himself) Jesus Christ

CHERYL
(Turning to ASHLY) You know mom and

dad would never let us go up to a place
like this if they knew-

ASHLY

-Which is exactly why they dont know
Ill tell you who I am gonna call
The guys that fixed up this car

The car approaches an exit along the highway

ASHLY glances at the map again

ASHLY

Hey I think this is where we get

off

ED - CAR

The car turns off the main highway and follows several
back roads until it approaches a narrow dirt lane that
winds upward along a twin set of mountains

ID - CAR

SCOTT glances up to the peaks

SCOTT

These mountains seem familiar

LINDA

What do they remind you of Some-
thing majestic Adventure

SCOTT

Yeah more like adventure

LINDA

Any adventure in particular

SCOTT

Shellys sweater

ASHLY and SCOTT laugh out loud LINDA laughs quietly
and CHERYL lets out an embarassed giggle to herself

SHELLY

(Teasing) Oooh youre gonna get it

Scotty when you least expect it
youre gonna get it good

ED - B

Finally the car arrives at a wooden bridge extending
over a great chasm Carefully the vehicle crosses

ED - CAB

It is late afternoon when they eventually arrive at their
destination The small wooden cabin is surrounded by
thick dark woods SCOTT shuts off the car but it contin-
ues to sputter and backfire

ID - CAR

ASHLY reacts to his car

ASHLY

II sent em a check for the tune-up
but Im just not paying for it

LINDA

This place is perfect
CHERYL
The woods come awfully close to the

house dont they

SCOTT

So whats wrong with the woods they
cant bite ya

CHERYL

Its just a little claustrophobic
thats all

LINDA

Well I think its beautiful

SHELLY

Me too its gonna be a bomb week-
end

ED - CAB

SCOTT moves to the front door of the cabin where he finds
a small ring of keys concealed on the shelf above the
door ASHLY unloads the car to the others

SCOTT

Its supposed to be one of these on
here

After trying several keys he is able to unlock the door

ID - MR

The interior of the cabin is completely dark SCOTT
opens the door and stands silhouetted in the doorway
for a moment then enters to find the light switch

The illumination reveals floors walls and ceilings
made of cedar There are two small bedrooms a kitchen
and the main room which contains a stone fireplace set
into the wall An old grandfather clock stands silently
in one corner partially hidden in the shadows A door
in the rear of the cabin leads to a small work shed
containing a work bench and an assortment of tools upon
the wall Located centrally in the main room is a trap
door leading to the cellar This catches SCOTTs eye
SCOTT

Hey this place has a dungeon

CHERYL puts down a case of art supplies and moves over
to SCOTT by the trap door He unlocks a chain securing
the trap door with one of his keys and hands the ring
to SHELLY

SCOTT

Put these back will you

SHELLY leaves with the keys and SCOTT tries to open the
hatch but cannot

SCOTT

They nailed it shut
CHERYL
Good I dont like cellars Probably

just some garbage down there anyways

SCOTT

Cheryl they dont nail garbage in
cellars I mean its not going to
try and get out or anything

CHERYL

Well whats down there

SCOTT

Well could be any number of things
Old baseball cards mushrooms dead
bodies-

LINDA

Hey look at this

LINDA is standing in the corner next to the old grand-
father clock She repositions a balance weight and it
begins to tick

LINDA

Ta daaaaaa

The others applaud and whistle LINDA smiles

ET - CAB

The cabin is seen from the outside Twilight has come

IT - MR

CHERYL sits alone in the living room near the window She
is drawing sketches of the old clock As she works the
ticking stops unexpectedly CHERYL puts down her pencil
and looks up to the clock It stands silently in the cor-
ner with its hands frozen in position There is a rust-
ling from the woods CHERYL looks out the window but can
see only the trees Something is moving outside yet re-
mains hidden within the forest A gust of wind fills the
room CHERYL glances down at her hand It turns a pale
white and begins to shake and jerk about uncontrollably
She stares on incredulously as her hand guided by some
unseen force picks up the pencil and begins to sketch

a figure upon her pad The wind gales through the open
window but dies down slowly as her hand completes the
drawing Whatever was at the edge of the woods has now
retreated further into them Her hand loses the pale
cast and is now under control once more CHERYL picks

up her pad of paper The likeness of a book with some
form of ancient writing on its cover has been sketched
She looks to the woods which are now silent A snapping
of wood is heard from the cellar CHERYL quickly turns
to the trap door still nailed shut in the floor Pos-
sibly just a mouse but she fixes her gaze upon it
Another sound almost like faint breathing comes from

the cellar

IT - KMR

ASHLY and LINDA enter from the kitchen ASHLY is drink-
ing a beer and moves over to CHERYL He stands between
her and the trap door

ASHLY

Whatre you drawing Cheryl

He picks up the piece of paper LINDA looks over his
shoulder to glance at it

CHERYL

II dont know

ASHLY

Is it a bible

CHERYL

No no its no bible (She glances
again at the cellar knowing some-
thing is down there) I dont know
what it is

LINDA

Well this one of the clocks not
bad

LINDA picks up the sketch and walks over to the clock
with it a few steps away She stands comparing it to
the real thing with her back to CHERYL and ASHLY She
is only a few inches from the trap door and CHERYL
wants to call out in warning when ASHLY kneels in front
of her to speak secretly
ASHLY

(In a whisper) I got it right here

He taps something in his shirt pocket CHERYL is looking
past him paying no attention She watches only LINDAs
feet waiting for whatever is in the cellar to grab them
LINDA looks at the drawing in comparison

LINDA

Cheryl this is really good I like

how you did the numbers in that wood-
ish style

ASHLY produces a small box from his shirt and opens it
quickly to show CHERYL It contains a gold pendant on
a necklace LINDA takes a step closer to the clock She
is now standing almost upon the trap door Although
nailed shut it opens slightly pulling the nails with
it CHERYL gasps ASHLY is pleased with her response

ASHLY

(Still in a whisper) I knew youd
like it

Quickly he places it back in his shirt and touches his
lips with a finger to indicate the secrecy of his sup-
rise LINDA returns with the sketch and places it back
on CHERYLs small drawing table

LINDA

Its really good Cheryl Very close
to the origional

CHERYL
(In a relieved whisper) Yes very

close

LINDA

Im gonna check dinner

LINDA returns to the kitchen and ASHLY turns to CHERYL

ASHLY

You better get washed up Ill see
ya in there

He winks then follows LINDA into the kitchen CHERYL
again looks at the cellar Slowly from her point of

view the camera moves in toward the trap door wait-
ingwaiting

27 IT - K

A blender screams as it mixes up a drink in the kitchen
SHELLY shuts it off and carries it to the dining room

28 IT - DR

She joins the others who are now seated at the dinner
table and serves the mixture SCOTT sits between LINDA
and CHERYL He leans over to CHERYL

SCOTT
(In a whisper) Dead bodies in the

cellar dead bodies in the cellar

CHERYL

Will you stop it

LINDA

Scott leave her alone will ya
SCOTT turns toward LINDA

SCOTT

Will you relax Im just kidding
around She can take a joke-

He stops talking as he hears the trickling
turns to see CHERYL finish pouring a glass
his lap The others laugh SCOTT is silent
then begins chuckling to himself He turns

SCOTT

(Jokingly) Ill get ya

With a napkin he blots the water from his

SCOTT

Ill get ya for this Cheryl

ASHLY stands with his drink and raises the

ASHLY

Id like to make a toast for all

of water He
of water in
for a moment
to CHERYL

pants

glass

here this evening As a greek friend
of mine once said Nis-hat-nis-fert-

dis-ruben-tu-tar-im

LINDA

Which means

SCOTT

Party down

The laughter is stifled by a loud snap and cracking of

wood heard from the main room

SCOTT

What the hell

All stand from the table and hurry to the main room

IN - MR

The nails that held down the trap door have been ripped
out and although still in tact the hatch is wide open
They stand silently in front of it looking blank as to
what could have done this CHERYL is slighly more nervous
than the others ASHLY is the first to speak

ASHLY

(Slowly) What is this

SCOTT

Whatever it is its still down there

CHERYL
I dont like cellars lets close it

up (She does not want to deal with
it) Its probably just some animal

SCOTT

An animal An anha-ha-ha-ha-ha-
thats the stupidest thing I ever
heard in my life Jesus Christ

SCOTT locates a flashlight and peers into the hole He
traces the old wooden steps into darkness with his light

LINDA

Maybe it is just some animal
SCOTT

Yeah probably right Its probably
just some animal UhCheryl why
dont you make sure

He hands the flashlight to CHERYL who quickly gives it
back

CHERYL

Scotty Im not going down there

SCOTT

Okay okay you cowards Ill go

LINDA

Scotty dont Youre crazy if you
go down there Why dont you wait
until morning

SCOTT

Look Ill be all right

SHELLY
What melodrama What courage A kiss

my brave hero

SCOTT kisses SHELLY and with flashlight in hand he descends
the narrow steps into the cellars blackness

SHELLY
I your virgin queen eagerly await

the precious moment when you will
ascend

SCOTT

Virgin queen Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-

He disappears below the floor SHELLY CHERYL LINDA and
ASHLY wait above

ASHLY

(Calling down) Hey Scott see any-
thing

There is no answer

ASHLY

Hey ScottScott

SHELLY

Hes just kidding around

There is silence

SHELLY

Isnt he

No sounds come from the cellar

ASHLY

Linda get me a flashlight

LINDA
Thats the only one we brought up

ASHLY spots a lantern on the fireplace mantle

ASHLY

Then get that lantern

LINDA brings it over ASHLY opens the kerosene valve
lights the wick and descends into the basement

IN - C

Down below ASHLY moves quietly past the old stone walls
and wooden beams which support the main floor above In
front of him stands an old door which leads to another
section of the cellar Cautiously he moves toward it
Before he can touch it the door swings open slowly with
a moan ASHLY moves through the doorway and deeper into
the cellar Condensation from water pipes above turn the
cellar into an echo chamber as drips fall into shallow
pools on the dirt floor below As ASHLY scans with his
light he spots a shadow move out the corner of his eye

ASHLY

Scott

ASHLY breaks into a cold sweat as he moves away from
the area where the shadow passed He backs sqarely into
a pair of arms which grab him

ASHLY

Ahhhhhhh

It is only SCOTT behind him

ASHLY

What the hell are you doing down
here jerkin off How come you
didnt answer me

SCOTT

When

ASHLY

Just now I mean upstairs

SCOTT

I didnt hear you

ASHLY

Oh well did you find anything

SCOTT

Uh-uh

ASHLY

Whats this

SCOTT sweeps his light to another corner and reveals
several items atop a small table Beneath a dusty cloth
he finds a book which appears to be covered in some sort
of animal hide with an ancient form of writing on the
cover Along with this book SCOTT and ASHLY uncover

a reel to reel tape recorder an ancient dagger and
other parapanalia including a box of rifle shells

EN - CAB

It is evening as darkness surrounds the small cabin

IN - MR

The group sits huddled around the fireplace talking
quietly about school The same bottle of Scotch is passed
around ASHLY is rewinding the tape recorder and once
this is done he turns it on The voice of an old man

is heard ASHLY turns to the others who are talking
ASHLY

Shhh listen to this

VOICE

My name is Julian Knowby I am a pro-
fessor of ancient Egyptian mythology
in Dextin universitys ancient history
department

ASHLY

This is the tape I found downstairs

VOICE

(Continuing)I am recording this
entry from a small cabin in the south-
ern mountains of Tennessee Here I am
staying with my wife for a few weeks
so that I may continue my research un-
disturbed Since May a group of assoc-
iate professors and myself have been
excavating the ruins of Can Dar I
believe I have made an important find
in that area and thus the reason for
this log With it I can keep an ac-—
curate record of translations from

my latest find the first of six the
others still lost volumes of ancient
Sumarian burial practices and rites
Basically it is a book of dos and
donts dealing with the deceased en-
titled Naturan Demanto roughly trans-
lated Book Of The Dead It is bound
in human flesh and inked with blood
of the deceased

SCOTT

Jeez Id hate to find out what they
used for pens

VOICE

(Continuing)This particular volume
deals with demons and demon resurrect-—
ion These are of the Katardi family
meaning those forces believed to inhab-
it the jungles and woods of mans do-
main The first few pages that I have
translated warn that these demons are
dangerous everpresent and exist
primarily through this book As legend
has it only the sacred high priests
of the Can Dar tribe could posess
these books for they alone could
properly control the resurrected de-
mons It is only through the act of
reciting the resurrection passage

that these demons would be able to
posess the living For many years it
was thought that this legend-

CHERYL turns off the machine at this point
SCOTT
Hey whatd you do that for It was
just getting good
CHERYL
I just dont want to hear any more

thats all

SCOTT

(Singing) Cheryls scared Cheryls
scared

ASHLY

Scott leave her alone will ya

SCOTT

Jesus Christ

He moves to the tape recorder and fast forewards it for
a bit then stops
SCOTT
Shes acting like a baby- its no
big deal

He turns the machine on The passage continues

VOICE

Tantir-ah-mis-trobeen-ha-zar-ta

33 EN - CAB

As the tape plays all natural sounds from the forest
die out and the autumn colors in the trees fade to a
gloomy grey

34 IN - MR

VOICE

Tantir-man-ov-mis-hazen-sober

All eyes except CHERYLs turn to the window

35 EN - CAB

Outside clouds roll in from the east thunder booms in
the distance and as the wind picks up it begins to rain

36 IN - MR

VOICE

Kanda

EN - CAB

A section of ground deep within the woods begins to crack
and opens Smoke seeps out from within as if some evil
force was now being unleashed

IN - MR
CHERYL
(In a whisper) Shut it off
VOICE
Kanda
EN - CAB

The winds howl and blackbirds fly from their nests
screaming

IN - MR

CHERYL

(Louder now) Shut it off

ASHLY hearing her for the first time turns from the
window to CHERYL She is overwhealmed with fear

VOICE

Kanda

EN - CAB

A bolt of lightning strikes very near and its thunder
crash is deafening

IN - MR

CHERYL can no longer control herself She screams and
covers her ears

CHERYL
Shut it offffff
The window shatters when a branch from a nearby tree
tears through it ASHLY runs to the tape recorder and

turns it off CHERYL is crying now and runs to her room
ASHLY turns to SCOTT

ASHLY

Scott you knew not to play it I
meanI mean you knew it was upset-
ting her You just dont know when
youre carrying something too far

SCOTT

(To SHELLY) Cmon (Back to ASHLY)
Big deal its just a joke shit

SCOTT and SHELLY head for their bedroom SCOTT mumbles
to himself along the way

SCOTT

Youd think shes three years old or
something

SCOTT slams the door behind him ASHLY sighs He moves
to the broken window and reaches through it to close
the outside shutters

LINDA

Hes really been bothering you hasnt
he

ASHLY walks to a chair near the other window

ASHLY

No Its not Scott Scottys okay
Its just that ever since we came

up here things have been a little
too tense (He sits) All these crazy
things going on And look at that
window- were gonna have to pay for
that window now

LINDA

Itll be better tomorrow Things1ll
smooth out youll see

ASHLY

I hope so

He looks at LINDA lovingly for a long moment

ASHLY

Whatya say we stay up for a while
and listen to the storm

LINDA

Deal Lemme check on Cheryl Ill be
right back

From across the room she is seen opening CHERYLs door
a crack LINDA asks if she is all right and gets a
muffled reply In the foreground ASHLY removes the
small box he showed to CHERYL earlier and places it in
his hand He glances behind to LINDA She closes CHERYLs
door and walks back to find ASHLY sound asleep with the
box in his hand She reaches for the box and ASHLY opens
his eyes to watch LINDA looks at him but his eyes are
closed again in time to still appear fast asleep LINDA
turns her attention back to the box ASHLY watches again
wide-eyed as she removes it from his hand Quickly
LINDA turns to him but as expected ASHLY is sleeping
like a baby She begins to turn back toward the box

and ASHLY opens his eyes but LINDA turns back again

in time to catch him with his eyes wide open

LINDA

Ah ha

ASHLY
(Laughing) Stealing from the blind
eh Its for you

LINDA begins to open the box

LINDA

It better be good

The gold necklace is revealed inside

LINDA

Oh Ash its beautiful

LINDA kisses ASHLY He removes the necklace from the box
and holds it around her neck

ASHLY

(Fastening it around her neck) I was
going to give it to you before we

left but things got so hectic this
is the first chance Ive had Do you

like it

LINDA moves to a mirror

LINDA

Its beautiful I really love it
(She turns to ASHLY) Ill never take
it off

EN - CAB

Lightning strikes as something in the woods examines the
small cottage Through the outside window ASHLY and
LINDA can be seen embracing This force watching them
moves around the house to another window The silhouette
of SCOTT and SHELLY undressing can be seen The force
continues around and arrives at CHERYLs window Inside
she brushes her hair in front of the mirror for a

moment then sets down her brush and moves to the window
She stops to uncrumple the sketch drawn earlier looks
at it then out to the dark woods

IN - CB

CHERYL can faintly hear some kind of sound It is the
same sound she had heard earlier from the cellar A
noise almost like that of something breathing

EN - CAB

The evil entity rounds the corner of the cabin as CHERYL
walks through the rooms to the front door She can be
seen stepping out the door It closes behind her Wind
shaking the tree branches sends dead leaves fluttering
about

CHERYL

(Calling to the woods) Is anybody

out there

There is no answer CHERYL steps away from the cottage
toward the woods

EN - W

The breeze animates her nightgown and it too seems alive
CHERYL stops

CHERYL

I know someones out thereI
heard youI heard you in the cellar

Suddenly CHERYL becomes chilled She folds her arms
around herself and stands at the woods edge listening
There is only darkness and sounds of the evening wind
blowing through the trees CHERYL steps into the forest
a few feet then stops A cry deep within the woods can
be heard She freezes Whispering in the distance grows
somewhat louder and a soft wail is heard- like that of
something long since dead dredged up to roam the earth
again CHERYL is about to turn back toward the cabin
when a rustling comes from a group of trees about twenty
yards behind her She stops No sound Nothing moves
Several yards to her left a twig snaps suddenly She
turns but there is silence again The winds die down
leaving a deathly stillness throughout the woods Then
all at once the entire forest becomes alive in a flurry
of chaotic noises and movement Snake-like vines wrap
around her ankles and slither up her legs Tree branches
near by begin to claw and rake at her The force is now
moving through the woods toward her CHERYL is able to
break the vines and run toward the cabin She emerges
from the woods and into the clearing The force is

still following

EN - CAB

CHERYL reaches the cabin door but it is locked She
begins pounding upon the door

CHERYL

Help help let me in Open the door

The evil entity now emerges from the woods

CHERYL

Ashly Linda Open up

CHERYL spots the small key ring above the door where
SHELLY had returned them earlier One by one she fran-
tically jams one key after another into the lock but
still cannot find the right one The force comes closer
with each key

CHERYL

Please someone please Help me help
meeeee

The evil entity is almost upon her but her actions are
so frantic that the ring falls to the ground She bends
down to pick them up but a hand grabs her arm It is
SCOTT who has opened the door from the inside She
pushes him in the door and slams it tightly

IN - MR

SCOTT

What the hell happ-

CHERYL
(In hysterics) Itit tried to kill

me I I heard a noise andand I

SCOTT

What are you-

He is cut off by ASHLY approaching with the others

ASHLY

Cheryl whats wrong with you Did
something in the woods do this to

CHERYL

No no nothe woods themselves-
The trees- theyre alive

She hugs ASHLY tightly and cries in hysterical sobs

CHERYL

Theyre alive

LINDA

bedroom so she can lie down a little-

CHERYL
(Cutting her off) -Im not lying

ASHLY

CHERYL

ASHLY

LINDA puts a coat around CHERYL as ASHLY helps her to
the door

EN - CAB

ASHLY and CHERYL move to the car ASHLY helps CHERYL in
then then gets in the drivers side

IN - CAR

CHERYL

ASHLY tries to start the car There is no response
CHERYL becomes somewhat worried ASHLY tries again

The car will not turn over A look of dread comes
across CHERYLs face

EN - CAB

SCOTT and the others join the two outside

IN - CAR

CHERYL

ASHLY again tries the engine
CHERYL
I know its not gonna start Its

not gonna let us leave

ASHLY keys the engine and it turns over this time

start-

ing up with a roar ASHLY worried by CHERYLs condition
glances over to her Confused and upset CHERYL turns
away from ASHLY and looks out her window They drive off

into the night through the wooded mountains toward
ASHLY glances at CHERYL who is studying the forest

town
in-

tensely for any sign of movement The concern for his
sister is made obvious by the expression on his face
Their car approaches the narrow bridge area and slows

down

CHERYL

Why are you slowing down

ASHLY brings the car to a halt

CHERYL

What is this

ASHLYs gaze is fixed directly ahead and his mouth opens
slowly He flips on the high beams which stab through the

evening mist

EN - B

The bridge over the chasm has been torn away CHERYL is
silent as ASHLY walks to the ravines edge to examine
any remains

IN - CAR
CHERYL
(Mumbling to herself) No no no no
noits not going to let us leave
its not going to let us goits
not gonna let us gooooo
EN - CAB

An axe is raised into the air then brought down smash-
ing upon a log splitting it in two SCOTT is chopping
wood outside the cabin Behind him through a window
CHERYL sits with a cup of tea in her hand watching him
SCOTT sets his axe down gathers the wood and moves
away CHERYL shifts her gaze from SCOTT to the woods
beyond The camera moves in toward CHERYL then past

her to SHELLY and LINDA who can be seen playing cards
on the floor ASHLY is seated near the fireplace with
the tape recorder in front of him He plugs an earphone
in so only he can hear it SCOTT enters the cabin and
passes in front of ASHLY to drop his wood to one side
of the fireplace He throws a log in and heads back
outside

56 IN - MR

From inside LINDA speaks

LINDA

Cheryl wanna play some cards

CHERYL

(Turning with a smile) Uh-uh

CHERYL turns to face the window again

LINDA

Hey tomorrow morning well find
some way around that cliff into town
okay
CHERYL
Okay
Outside the window SCOTT chops more wood for the nights

fire ASHLY turns on the tape recorder to listen with
the ear plug

VOICE

March 12th Suzanne came after me
and almost murdered me My own wife
At first I thought it was a mental
or physical disorder because of what
had happened to her eyes but I was
only fooling myself I knew what it
was

Outside the window SCOTT continues to chop and gather
wood SHELLY still engaged in cards with LINDA holds
up one in particular
SHELLY
Okay guess this card

LINDA
How am I going to know what card
that is

SHELLY
Guess Im going to see if youre
psychic

The card is a two of clubs

LINDA

Okaaaayis it a queen

SHELLY
Right

LINDA
Really

SHELLY
Yeah

LINDA

Hey Ash I guessed the card right

ASHLY

(indifferently) Truly amazing Linda
He is listening intently to the log as it continues

VOICE
Three days have passed since that
thing has been down there I was hop-
ing to weaken it without food or
water Nothing worked Finally in
desperation I dragged her out to the
shed and dismembered her so that what-
ever it was could not get up again
SHELLY
Cheryl did you see that
CHERYL remains with her back to them staring out the
window

SHELLY

Try this one

She removes a nine of clubs from the deck and holds it up

LINDA

Okay lemme think uh

She puts her hands to her head in a curved funnel form-
ation as if to direct her thoughts to the card

LINDA

Um its a seven

SHELLY

Oh my God what suit

LINDA

Diamonds no wait I mean hearts

SHELLY

Thats right- seven of hearts

LINDA

Hey Ash did you see that I guessed
two cards in a row

ASHLY

(Still not paying attention) How do
you do it Linda

He is concentrating on the tape

She holds

VOICE

This is when I saw the dark figures
moving about in the woods I should
have never tampered with the Book

Of The Dead I now know that what-
ever it is I have resurrected through
this book is coming for me

LINDA

You know I always thought I had
some sort of extra sense You know
like esp or something

SHELLY

Whats this one

LINDA

Another seven
SHELLY

I dont believe it

CHERYL
(Still looking outside) Queen of

spades

SHELLY looks at her card then back to CHERYL She holds
up another card

CHERYL

Four of hearts

The card is a four of hearts SHELLY bites her lip in
fear and reaches for another card ASHLY and LINDA listen
in silence

CHERYL

Eight of spades

SHELLY picks up the card CHERYL is correct again

CHERYL

Two of spades- jack of diamonds-
jack of clubs-

Faster and faster she calls them off Even before SHELLY
can flip them to keep up Suddenly CHERYL turns toward
the group Her eyes are bone white SHELLYs deck of
cards slip from her hand and scatter across the floor
CHERYLs body is hoisted up to its feet and jerked about
like a white-eyed marionette She speaks in a voice un-
like her own

CHERYL

Why have you disturbed our sleep
awakened us from our ancient slum-
ber You will die Like the others
before you We will take you one by
one All of you ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-

She screams in a low gruff voice and collapses to the
floor

ASHLY

Oh my God Shelly get Scott in here

SHELLY does not respond

ASHLY

Hurry

She exits through the front door LINDA moves to CHERYL
and lifts her head gently CHERYL appears unconcious but
behind her she reaches for a pen

LINDA

Did you see her eyes Im scared
Whats wrong with her

ASHLY begins to speak when SCOTT and SHELLY enter

SCOTT

What happened to her

CHERYLs hand clutches the pen tightly

LINDA

Look at her eyes

SCOTTs hand reaches for CHERYLs eyes to inspect them
but they blink open The pen in her hand races upward

then slashes down ripping into LINDAs achilles tendon
LINDA screams fiercely and with a blur the bloodied

pen is raised again ASHLY grabs CHERYLs arm stopping
her but with a powerful swipe she swings her remaining
arm at LINDA who is sent sprawling across the cabin
floor CHERYL then clutches ASHLY and almost lifting
him sends his body reeling across the room into a book-
case which topples over trapping him beneath its weight
SHELLY stands screaming as CHERYL now advances toward
ASHLYs face with the bloody pen He struggles to pull
himself out but cannot CHERYL is almost upon him when
SCOTT grabs her from behind Effortlessly she tosses

him off and moves toward ASHLY again SCOTT climbs to

his feet and grabs the axe CHERYL raises the pen above
ASHLYs face and SCOTT gives her a sharp jab in the
jaw with the wooden handle CHERYL stumbles past LINDA
and falls backwards head first into the cellar She
begins to climb out but SCOTT slams the trap door shut
upon her hand It wont close CHERYL starts to push
the trap door open from below SCOTT climbs on top
and is almost thrown off until he viciuosly rams the
butt of his axe down upon her protruding hand Demented
screams and moans are heard from below as CHERYLs hand
is finally pulled back and SCOTT manages to secure the
chain across the hatch

IN - LB

Later that evening LINDA is seen in her bed sleeping
ASHLY covers her with a blanket kisses her and walks
to the door closing it quietly behind him

IN - MR

ASHLY joins SCOTT and SHELLY who sit near the fire in

the main room From the cellar strange moans sobs and
laughter emerge then horrible rasping sounds from CHERYLs
breathing Through the next sequence of dialogue her
breathing becomes louder then somewhat quiet

SCOTT

Shell be okay Ash she just took a
bad bump
ASHLY

(Quietly) Yeah

SCOTT and SHELLY listen to the strange noises from below
as ASHLY looks out the window to the woods beyond

ASHLY

Weve still got a few hours before
morning

SHELLY

I dont know if I can wait that
long

SCOTT

You have to We all have to Then
once its light out well try to
find a way to get around that chasm

SHELLY

(Covering her ears) Why does she keep
making those horrible noises

ASHLY

I dont know

SHELLY

And what about her eyes

ASHLY and SCOTT are quiet

SHELLY

What about her eyes (Desperately)
For Gods sake what happened to

her eyes

CHERYL patiently sits in the cellars darkness with a
streak of light across her eyes from the crack in the
trap door Her head is slightly tilted as she watches
and listens to what is said above From her point of
view we hear SCOTT speak to SHELLY

SCOTT

Everythings gonna be all right

CHERYLs lips part slightly and a thick blackish yellow
liquid drools out between her teeth She grins

EN - CAB

Outside the forest is very dark The unseen force moves
from the wooded area pushing over small trees and shrubs
as it advances The cottage comes into view and the evil
entity glides up to it The figure of a girl in the cabin
window can be seen looking out The force stops and moves
behind a bush

IN - MR
Inside SHELLY is studying the woods
SHELLY
Scotty II think theres some-

thing out there

SCOTT joins her at the window and looks out

EN - CAB

From within the woods this force watches SCOTT peer out

but he can see nothing Through the window he says some-
thing to reassure SHELLY and moves away

IN - MR

Inside SCOTT can be heard in mid sentence

SCOTT

Is to get some rest Ash and I
can stay up with Cheryl

SHELLY

Okay

SCOTT

Everythings gonna be okay Come
morning- youll see

SHELLY heads to her bedroom SCOTT walks back to the
fireplace and sits He slices twigs from a branch with
the Sumarian dagger and tosses them into the fire ASHLY
glances at the Book Of The Dead then to the old clock
It stands silent

EN - CAB

Again the evil entity watches from outside It sees
SHELLY leave one room and turn the lights on in another
She begins to undress near the window The force now
moves from behind its cover and rushes at tremendous
speed to SHELLY who is looking out her bedroom window
She sees it and sheer terror covers her face as a scream
stifles itself in her throat but it is too late

IN - MR

A noise is heard from SHELLYs bedroom SCOTT drops the
small stick he was whittling and looks up He places
the dagger on the floor and walks toward SHELLYs room

SCOTT

Shelly are you okay

She does not answer SCOTT approaches her door and turns
to ASHLY

SCOTT

Keep an eye on Cheryl for a minute

IN - SB

SCOTT enters the darkness of her room and sees nothing
amidst the shadows

scott

Shelly

He looks over to her window It is open and wind blows
upon the curtains

IN - S BATH

SCOTT steps into SHELLYs bathroom and sees that the
shower curtain is drawn Cautiously he moves up to it

SCOTT

Shelly

He pulls the curtain back to reveal an empty tub SCOTT
turns back to the bedroom when SHELLY steps into the
doorway posessed With a scream she latches upon SCOTT

Her eyes have gone bone white and she claws at SCOTTs
face and clothes with her nails

IN - SB

Screaming SCOTT stumbles through her bedroom with SHELLY
still upon him biting at his throat

IN - MR

They stagger into the main room where SCOTT manages to
knock SHELLY off himself and into the fireplace She
remains motionless as her head smolders upon the hot
coals SCOTT rushes to her grabs an arm and pulls her
out SHELLYs face and hair on one side of her head are
seared and blackened She blinks her eyes open turns
her charred head to SCOTT and speaks in a rasp

SHELLY

Thank you I dont know what I would
have done if I had remained on the hot
coals burning my pretty flesh You
have pretty skin- give it to us

Cackling SHELLY clutches SCOTTs neck and begins throttl-
ing the life out of him with a vice-like grip He tries
to break the hold but cannot ASHLY also tries but with

a backhand blow SHELLY knocks him into a cabinet smash-
ing it to bits A garbled cry for help escapes from
SCOTTs frothing mouth SHELLY reaches down picks up

the Sumarian dagger and holding SCOTT by his throat

with one hand she raises the dagger with the other
ASHLY slightly injured crawls to his feet SCOTT

grabs her raised arm and although choking swings

his camping knife from its side sheath and slices

deep into SHELLYs raised wrist almost severing it

A murky black ooze pumps from the wound She emits

an ear splitting- howl and tightens her grip on SCOTTs
throat He drops the hunting knife ASHLY watches
terrified unable to move as SHELLY raises her dangling
hand (Still clutching the dagger) to her mouth and

bites it off The useless part falls to the floor

with the dagger still firmly in its fist SCOTT now

almost dead grabs her severed hand clutching the
dagger and in a last attempt swings it around ramming
the blade into her spine

SHELLY screetches along with CHERYL in the cellar the
old grandfather clock gongs and lightning strikes all
at the same instant SHELLY reaches around with her
remaining arm to clutch at the severed hand and knife
protruding from her own back A thick black ooze pours
from the wound as she bends backward screaming ASHLY
stands in horror clutching the axe unable to move
Black ooze runs from SHELLYs mouth as her body writhes
about spasmatically upon the floor Gradually the move-
ments cease and she is dead As SCOTT slowly stands to
his feet SHELLYs arm grabs his leg

SCOTT

Ahhhhhhh

Some force reanimates her even though the body is
dead

ASHLY

Nonono

SCOTT

Hit her

SHELLYs body is hoisted up jerking about to its feet
and laughing madly

SCOTT

Hit it

SCOTT screams this as he backs toward ASHLY who stands
with the axe paralyzed Gurgling black ooze SHELLY
advances toward them with one remaining arm SCOTT
grabs the axe from ASHLY pushes him away and slams

it into her Lightning flashes thunder booms and
CHERYL screams from the cellar SCOTT brings his axe
down again and again in a frenzy Then after the
final chop there is silence

SHELLYs body remains on the floor for quite some time-
until ASHLY can cope with the fact that she is dead and
something must be done

ASHLY
UhScott

SCOTT
Yeah

ASHLY

What is uhwhat are we gonna do

SCOTT

Bury her

ASHLY

Youcant bury Shelly Shes a friend
of ours isnt she

SCOTT

Ash shes dead

ASHLY moves away from SCOTT

SCOTT

Shellys dead Were gonna bury
her now

ASHLY bites his lip and looks about blankly

69 EN - CAB

Finally the body is dragged outside and buried near
the work shed Harsh floodlights from the house make the
task look very stark and barren

IN - MR

SCOTT and ASHLY return inside ASHLY heads to LINDAs
room to check in on her

IN - LB

He peers in to see LINDA sleeping peacefully

IN - MR

ASHLY quietly returns to the main room SCOTT is load-
ing new batteries into a flashlight

SCOTT

I saw an old hiking trail when we
were driving up here Now I dont
know if it goes all the way around
that gorge-

ASHLY

-Or if its even still in tact

SCOTT

Or if its even still in tact But
uh I guess Ill find out Take good
care of Linda

ASHLY

I will Do you have everything
SCOTT
(Putting on a small back pack) Yeah-

all set

ASHLY

ListenScottyIm sorry about
falling apart like that when-

SCOTT

Dont bother really

He steps out the door

SCOTT
If I find a way out of here Ill
mark it and then come back Then if
Im not back here in a few hours
if for some reasonwell if I dont

come back grab Linda leg and all
and just get her the hell out of here

They shake hands

ASHLY

Youre a good man

SCOTT

Good Im the best

73 EN - CAB

ASHLY smiles a good-bye to SCOTT and watches him move
off into the night He lingers for a moment by SHELLYs

grave then slowly disappears into the woods

IN - MR

ASHLY closes the door and turns back to the main room

N - LB

He opens the door and a crack of light falls across
LINDA wakes up

LINDA

Whos there Ash

ASHLY

Its me Linda

LINDA

Ash I had a bad dream about Linda

ASHLY

You did baby

LINDA

Yeah Shes all right isnt she

ASHLY

Yeah Fine

He sees CHERYLs eyes through the crack in the cellar
She has been watching all of this through a space be-
tween the trap door and floor ASHLY walks past her to
LINDAs room

her

LINDA

Is Shelly okay too Ash

ASHLY can no longer hide his fear and anxiety He speaks
in a whisper so as not to let his voice quiver

ASHLY

Yeah sure Shes sleeping thats
all

LINDA

Ash I love you (She turns over)

ASHLY

Get some rest

ASHLY closes the door behind him and the fear from a few
hours ago engulfs him once more

IN - MR

ASHLY moves into the main room and stops dead in his
tracks when a voice in the cellar speaks

CHERYL

You lied to her You lied to Linda
Shellys not sleeping Shes dead
Dont you know the difference You
killed her You and Scott cut her up
with the axe Shes dead ha-ha-ha-ha-
ha-ha-

ASHLY picks up the axe and slams it down upon the trap
door CHERYL is silent from below for a moment then
the hatch opens an inch or so (The length of the chain
securing it) CHEYLs white eyes can be seen again

CHERYL

Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-

ASHLY takes the axe and steps outside

EN - CAB

He begins to chop wood taking out his emotions upon
the logs with each blow SHELLYs blood can still be
seen on the blade of the axe

IN - MR

From her dungeon CHERYL watches ASHLY chop wood in the
window The shadow of his axe rising then striking is
seen over her white eyes

EN - CAB

Exhausted ASHLY puts down the axe He looks off into
the woods but there is no sign of SCOTT He returns to
the cabin

IN - MR

CHERYL begins her taunting again

CHERYL

Soon all of you will be like me and
then who will lock you in the cellar
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-

CHERYL begins to violently ram her fists against the trap
door ASHLY walks by her to LINDAs room

IN - LB

She is still asleep Quietly so as not to wake her ASHLY
pulls back her blanket exposing the bandaged leg He re-
moves the wrappings and looks at the wound As he does
this it infects with a blackened coloration at an in-
credible speed ASHLY looks up to see if LINDA is still
sleeping and sees that she has been watching him with
white eyes and an evil grimace upon her face She lets

out a low growl

IN - MR

ASHLY jolts backwards out of her room to escape through
the front door He steps outside and stops to look back
in He can see the main room but finds it difficult to
see in LINDAs room being lost in the shadows Something
ragged and bloody grabs him It is SCOTTs mutilated
body ripped and torn to shreds He is still alive ASHLY
looks behind him through the door to LINDAs room He
can barely make out LINDA who sits on the bed watching
him with glaring white eyes ASHLY helps SCOTT to the
couch so he can sit SCOTT is in agony and can barely
speak

SCOTT

Ash I think Im dying Jesus I
cant feel my legs

ASHLY
Uhuh Scotty youre gonna be okay
Youre gonna be just fine- youll see

He throws another log on the fire

ASHLY

Youll see
He looks off into LINDAs bedroom again but she is gone
She is now sitting in the corner of the main room where
ASHLY is watching him SCOTT begins to cough with hor-
rible rasping sounds

SCOTT

Its its not gonna let us leave
CherylCheryl was rightwere

ASHLY

Were not gonna die

SCOTT

-All gonna die All of us
ASHLY grabs SCOTT and shakes him violently
ASHLY
Were not gonna die Were not gonna

the chasm

SCOTT passes out

ASHLY

Scotty Scott

ASHLY slaps SCOTT He stirs awake and mumbles

SCOTT

His

CHERYL

ASHLY

SCOTT

the chasm

SCOTT

There isone way the trailbut
the trees they knowdont you see-

sentence is cut short as he cries out in sharp pain

Blood dribbles from his nostrils and he doubles over
grabbing his stomach LINDA begins to laugh ASHLY looks
to her or rather what posesses her with hatred

She
the
she
the
and

ASHLY

Shut up

continues to laugh CHERYL in the cellar joins in
laughter ASHLY walks to LINDA and slaps her but
continues He grabs a hunting rifle from a rack on
wall loads it with shells flips off the safety
places the barrels against LINDAs head
ASHLY

God forgive me Linda

The laughter stops and her eyes return to normal It
is LINDA again ASHLY puts down the rifle

LINDA

Ash oh Ash help Me Please

She hugs him tightly

LINDA
Dont let them take me away again
please please please

ASHLY
(Crying and holding her tightly) I
wont I wont- I promise

CHERYLs voice is heard from the blackness of the cellar

CHERYL
Ashly Ashly help me Let me out

of here Im all right now

ASHLY releases LINDA and moves cautiously to the cellar
LINDA remains behind nervously fumbling with her necklace
CHERYL
Im all right now Ashly Im all
right Come unlock this chain and
let me out
ASHLY

Cheryl
There is no reply from the cellar ASHLY looks through
the crack but sees only darkness He reaches for the
chain and begins to unlock it but sensing something
wrong he stops

ASHLY

Cheryl

He puts his ear to the floor listening for the slight-
est sound CHERYLs arms rip through the floor boards
and grab ASHLYs head He breaks away and her hand
reaches for the chain but cannot quite grasp it Slowly
it withdraws beneath the floor

CHERYL
(A little too sweet) Ash what are you

doing This is your sister Cheryl Dont
you recognize me

Her voice drifts off and the evil leughter resumes from
the celler

ASHLY

(Crying and yelling to the cellar)
You bastards Why are you doing this
Why

There is silence for a moment Laughter from behind him
begins again It is LINDA Her eyes are white once more
and she laughs at ASHLY

ASHLY

OhLinda

With newly found courage ASHLY angrily grabs LINDA by
the legs and drags her outside

EN - CAB
LINDA
Its useless useless useless In

time well come for him then you
ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-

ASHLY leaves her in the woods and runs back to the cabin
closing the door behind him

IN - MR

SCOTT is coughing again

SCOTT

Ash Ash pleaseI dont want to
die- butbut I cant stand this
pain It hurts Ash Gimme something
Gimme something to put me out

ASHLY

Scott I cant I- I know its bad
But I cant be alone now I cant

SCOTT

Please Ash please

ASHLY

Youll get better- youll see

LINDAs laughter is faintly heard outside ASHLY moves

to the window and pulls back the curtain LINDA is no
longer in the woods but sitting at the edge of the clear-
ing watching ASHLY with her glowing white eyes
ASHLY

Yeah tomorrow soon youll be
better and well both get out of
here tomorrow

SCOTT

There is no tomorrow You- youve
got to kill her and cut- cut her
up- your sister too

ASHLY

No that was only with Shelly You

ASHLY places a glass to Scotts lips

ASHLY

Now now the sun will be up in an
hour or so and well get out of here
together You me Linda Shelly-
n-no not Shelly she- well all go
home together Wouldnt you like to
be going home Youd like that Id
bet wouldnt ya

There is no answer from SCOTT The water runs out of
his mouth

ASHLY

-Scott

SCOTT is dead LINDAs laughter is heard again ASHLY
walks to the window and pulls back the curtain There
is nothing there He turns and she is there With the
Sumarian dagger LINDA rips into ASHLYs shirt cutting
his arm He screams and watches in horror as she runs
her tongue over the dagger licking the blood from it

She turns her attention toward ASHLY again but he grabs
her and they struggle LINDA backs ASHLY up against
SCOTT knocking his body to the floor CHERYLs gnarled
arm reaches up through the broken floor boards and
grabs at ASHLYs foot He manages to turn LINDAs arm
so the knife is behind her back Forcefully ASHLY
pushes her over the body of SCOTT and she falls back-
ward upon the dagger impaling herself upon it The
blade tears into her back and rips through her stomach
Lightning flashes thunder roars and LINDA screams in
a deep growl once then all is quiet

ASHLY drags LINDAs corpse past the crumpled body of
SCOTT past CHERYL who watches all of this from below
through the back door and out to the work shed

IN - WS

He lifts her up onto the work bench and secures her body
to it with a number of chains which hang from nails
along the wall He rips down a tarp hanging on the

wall to reveal a chain saw He starts it up and moves
toward her Buzzing madly the saw is lowered to a
position several inches above LINDAs neck ASHLY looks
into LINDAs face Her eyes have gone back to blue He
turns off the saw

ASHLY

(In a whisper) Linda

He drops the saw and breaks down crying over LINDAs
body

EN - CAB

An evening mist drifts out of the woods and cloaks the
shed as ASHLY carries LINDAs body outside for burial
He lays the body upon the ground and picks up a shovel
Harsh floodlights from the corners of the cabin create
strange shadows on the ground as ASHLY digs LINDAs
grave She lies on her back during the digging One of
her eyes opens It is white ASHLY drops the shovel
and looks at her She appears to be dead

IN - MR

Inside the cabin CHERYL begins slamming her fists
against the trap door in the cellar again She wants
out The screws holding the hatch in place begin to
loosen

EN - CAB

ASHLY places LINDAs corpse in the grave oblivious to
CHERYLs pounding He begins to cover her with dirt

IN - MR

CHERYL has ripped out all but one screw which holds the
trap door in tact

EN - CAB

ASHLY glances to the grave and sees LINDAs necklace on
top of the dirt mound He reaches down to pick it up

when LINDAs hand shoots up from beneath the grave and
grabs him She pulls herself up out of the grave scream-
ing and clutches ASHLYs leg with a black and bloodied
hand He twists around trying to free himself but she
will not let go By now LINDA is almost completely out
of the grave With her fingernails she rips into ASHLYs
leg tearing his skin Screaming he picks up a large

log nearby and swings it roundhouse into her face again
and again breaking the wood into smaller bits She grabs
the log with him clinging to the other end lifts him

up and throws ASHLY log and all away from her ASHLY
hits the ground with considerable force and for the

first time begins to comprehend the power of this thing
he is dealing with Thick black ooze pours from LINDAs
nose and mouth as she turns toward ASHLY sprawled on

the ground

ASHLY

Stay back

His hand gropes for the handle of the spade LINDA
advances toward him laughing

ASHLY

Linda please if you can still hear
me Keep away

His fingers tighten on the wooden handle With a scream
she lunges toward him From the ground ASHLY swings the
spade upward lopping off her head The head falls into
the mud but the body falls upon him grabbing and jerk-
ing about spasmatically Thick black ooze pumps from

her neck and ASHLY manages to pull himself out from
underneath the body He backs away in disgust and falls
He picks himself up again and sees LINDAs necklace

upon the ground ASHLY stashes it in his pocket and
staggers back to the cabin

IN - MR

Inside he looks to the main room beyond SCOTTs body

ASHLY

It is a moan from deep inside him The trap door is open
and CHERYL is gone ASHLY walks over and kicks it shut
A slight breeze sweeps through the front door causing
SHELLYs bedroom door to creak open ASHLY picks up the
rifle again and cautiously moves to the door

IN - SB

He enters The room is dark and the closet door bangs
back and forth because of the breeze ASHLY moves toward

it grabs the handle and slowly opens the door Only
clothes are inside He turns toward the other end of
the room and CHERYL pops up in the window right by him
He swings and fires shattering the window CHERYL
backs away and spots the open front door

ASHLY

The door

He makes a mad dash through SHELLYs room

In the main room ASHLY races for the door

EN - CAB

Outside CHERYL is almost upon the door

IN - MR

ASHLY arrives in time but CHERYL has already started
reaching in He slams the door on her fingers and rams
his gun butt down upon them Horrible screams are heard
as CHERYL withdraws her hand ASHLY is able to slam

the door and bolt it He runs to the back entrance lead-
ing to the shed and locks it also On his way back to
the main room he pumps his rifle in preparation It is
his last shell

ASHLY

(To himself) More shells Where did
I see that box of shells

IN - C

From the basement the trap door lifts open and ASHLY
decends The bottom step now rotten breaks under his
weight and ASHLY sprawls to the floor Slowly he picks
himself up and walks through the dividing stone doorway
beneath the water pipes to a small table On it he finds
the box of shells and quickly loads them into the gun

He ascends the steps and enters the main room once more

IN - MR

he sound of ticking catches ASHLYs attention He looks
p to see the old grandfather clock slowly winding back-
ards He watches and waits tensely Turning carefully
SHLY tries to monitor all the windows The ticking grows
ouder A shadow passes in the window before him and he
ires shattering the glass into a million pieces Wind
hips through the cabin swirling glass and leaves to the
loor ASHLY waits leaning against the front door for
omething to happen He is tense and more determined

han ever to survive He whispers to himself

tHOMmMehMEP EC H

ASHLY

Cmon cmon get it over with why
are you torturing me like this

Placing his hand to his side ASHLY discovers something
in his pocket He lifts it to his eyes It is LINDAs
necklace

ASHLY

Linda (He whispers)

The ticking stops He tilts his head for the slightest
sound All is silent From behind two arms rip through
the door and grab him ASHLY tears away and falls to
the floor The necklace is tossed away in the confusion
CHERYLs hands pull away and she looks through a hole
in the door From the floor ASHLY raises his rifle and
fires at her head

EN - CAB

Clutching at her face and screaming horribly CHERYL
is jolted from the door

IN - MR

ASHLY places a dresser and chair against the holes in
the door Behind ASHLY SCOTTs corpse sits up and opens
its white eyes It stands and moves toward ASHLY He
turns with the gun but SCOTT knocks it out of his hands
Desperately ASHLY grabs a table lamp and shatters it
across SCOTTs head then jams the exposed socket into
his face shocking him SCOTT staggers back several
steps then continues after ASHLY

EN - CAB

Outside Cheryl is now pounding against the front door

IN - MR

ASHLY picks up a small table upon which are the Book Of
The Dead and the professors journal He throws it at
SCOTT This does not affect him and he advances closer
The Book Of The Dead lands near the fireplace and edges
of the paper darken from the heat SCOTT picks up ASHLY
and begins to throttle him as if he were a rag doll The
front door begins to give under CHERYLs pounding ASHLY
brings his hands to SCOTTs eyes With a crash CHERYL
breaks through the front door and begins to push the
dresser away Pages from the Book Of The Dead are smolder-
ing now ASHLY jams his fingers into SCOTTs eyes and
slips from the grip SCOTT clutches his eye sockets and
his back begins to smolder ASHLY now sees the book Its
pages burn at the edge CHERYL topples the dresser and
