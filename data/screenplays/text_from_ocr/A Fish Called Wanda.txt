Something violent is happening in a Hatton Garden ‘establishment

Employees are rising in alarm They disappear from view when the
reinforced glass of the office is splintered by a blast from a
sawn-off shot-gun The gun swings round and shatters the lock of

the office door

Three balaclaved figures burst through the door pushing a
terrified customer before them The first (OTTO) draws on a gun
and fires two shots at TV Cameras covering the room A monitor
on a desk in foreground goes blank OTTO sweeps it from the desk
During these brief seconds the other two villains GEORGE and KEN
have forced the terrified employees to lie on the floor hands on
their heads OTTO moves swiftly to the steel grid of the strong
room producing a small cross-bow as he goes KEN runs back to
the entrance past him -

The startled MANAGER comes out of the office and encounters
