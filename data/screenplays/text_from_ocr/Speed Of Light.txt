MUSIC UP - PATSY CLINE’S CRAZY DREAMS -- OVER
EXT BONNEVILLE UTAH -- MORNING

Imagine a place so flat that you can actually see the
curvature of the planet So barren not even the simplest
life forms can exist And it’s not an alien world far from
Earth welcome to Utahs Bonneville Salt Flats 30 thousand
square acres of nothing

Crazy Dreams linger on as I face an empty dawn with no end
to it all can I see

On the HORIZON something approaching Look closer a HUMVEE
making its way in this salt desert We have no idea what
its up to - until we see the payload a JET-FUELED concept
CAR Corporate logos all over it POLAR MOLECULAR GOODYEAR
FORD to name a few But what stands out is the custom paint
job that advertises its driver THE FASTEST MAN ON EARTH

DOMINIC (0S)

JAMES

INT ROADSIDE DINER -- MORNING

This is a place where time stands still A classic
prefabricated structure Long and narrow with lots of
stainless steel a FORMICA COUNTER and swivelling stools
which are bolted to the floor

BEHIND THE COUNTER - The OWNER stands by silently and still
as a cigar store Indian

IN A BOOTH - Our family is digging into their breakfasts
while Dominic fidgets with his watch Suddenly the place
SHAKES briefly But nobody even seems to notice - save for
Dominic It looks like it irritated him

DOMINIC
Come on guys let’s go

MEHGAN
Let’em finish their breakfast

Dominic rolls his eyes

JOHN
Hey Pa Am I comin’ today

Silence as Pa deliberates He looks at his disapproving wife
DOMINIC

Well see Just finish your
breakfast
EXT SALT FLATS -- DAY -- SERIES OF SHOTS

Take the pits of the Indianapolis Speedway and drop them in
the middle of nowhere Tens of thousands of fans huddled
around their favorite crews and cars Did I say cars Cause

wheels tricked out to the max built for super-speed

AT A SOUVENIR BOOTH - a variety of race-related goods are

DOMINIC
The boy is 18 now Meg Hell

F-15 in about six months And this
is the type of stuff they look for
If hes going to be a test pilot

experience

MEHGAN
He can get experience later Let
him go to college with his friends
DOMINIC
Give him blank checks for books
Letem do jello-shots for four
years I dont think so

MEHGAN
It worked for you

Touché

MEHGAN

MEHGAN
You know youre so concerned with

DOMINIC

Dominic hugs his wife

DOMINIC

Theres the fleeting hesitation in his eyes that tell us
something is bothering him But he covers it well hugging
his wife

INT DRESSING ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER

Where John is standing in front of a CLOSET filled with
RACING SUITS He’s studying each one picking out his
favorite when Dominic enters and just watches a moment

DOMINIC
You ready for this

The kid turns to see dad gives us an ear to ear grin but
still he doesnt look ready Dad steps forward Pulls
something from his POCKET

DOMINIC
You know this thing is more of a
jet than it is a race car

JOHN

Okay Saddle up

John is overjoyed immediately starts getting ready

Dominic exits the trailer not as confident as he was Its
clear something is on his mind when he suddenly stops
Thinks Looks to the sky Its as if he feels something
Disregarding this instinct he moves on

CROSSFADE

EXT DYNAMITE ROAD -- CONTINUOUS

They call this place DYNAMITE ROAD Its where the fastest
land vehicles in the world come to run And heres where we
finally get a good look at our rig And what a beauty she is
Take a jet fighter and remove the wings Now bump it out with
the curves of a ‘vette and add TWO MAMMOTH SPEY JET ENGINES
at the rear This is the coolest HOT WHEELS CAR youve ever
seen - only all grown up and real

INT DOMINICS TRAILER -- CONTINUOUS

Dominic is all dressed and ready appraising himself in the
mirror Equipment-wise not much more than your NASCAR racer
But he looks way badder Around his neck The identical
AMULET he gave to his son ST JOSEPH He holds it a moment
then reverentially puts on his HELMET

Its GO TIME

MUSIC UP - AND OVER

As Dominic moves towards his ROCKET CAR and takes his seat in
the front DRIVING

The seating arrangement is not unlike a FIGHTER PLANE Pa
takes the FRONT SEAT where hell man the speed and navigate
Dominic looks back at his boy who’s already seated With his

INT ROCKET CAR -- CONTINUOUS
ON THE SPEEDOMETER - Its a joke 147891501

Were already heading towards 200mph and it looks like
Dominic is out for a Sunday spin

DOMINIC
Runnin through the first tick

He does just that - and we can feel the percussive humm of
the JETS pick up

2201234 and risingPa glances at the GAUGES

CLOSE ON GAUGES - all seem normal save ONE GUAGE where the
needle is encroaching on the RED

Dominic doesnt seem too concerned he covers his mic

DOMINIC

DOMINIC
You ready to tip this cow boy

With that Dominic drops the throttle and we really take off
SHHHWEWWWWWW

ROCKETING THROUGH THIS GREAT WHITE EXPANSE -

441427456478

Were approaching sonic level now And as the car shoots past
us it looks like its actually leaving the ground (Because
it is This is why they are built so heavy)

500mph

SHOCK WAVES begin to form around the car rising up and
bending outward Even more astonishing is the vertical BOW
WAVE in front of it This is the infamous WALL OF AIR
that caused so many a test pilot to crash Its the SOUND
BARRIER - and were approaching it

553554555556557

INTERCUT —- TENT

POV DOMINIC -- CONTINUOUS

Were moving so fast its amazing he can see anything But
right in the middle of that BOW WAVE is a small SPECTRUM of
LIGHT and COLOR 581582583584

All the while the GAUGE is getting higher and higher

DOMINIC
You might wanna cover your ears for
this

BACK IN THE TENT - They do

And we watch as the car screams forward almost chasing this
SOUND BARRIER 594595596closer597598599and
CLOSER

600601602603

The car begins to cross the threshold SHOCK WAVES
surrounding it INTENSIFY begin to SPLINTER And with each
passing moment we get the feeling that a major eruption is
coming to culmination And just as the car passes through -
the WAVES SHOOT UPWARD AND OUT BLASTING into the atmosphere
with a spectacular SONIC BOOM

THE FOLLOWING ALL HAPPENS SIMULTANEOUSLY

IN THE TENT - Ears are covered but the ground QUAKES from
the rolling thunderclap

AT THE RACE TRACK - The EXPLOSION rocks the flats all eyes
look SKYWARD

IN THE DINER - DISHES RATTLE again as the place quivers The
OWNER shakes his head Damn sonic racers

And BACK IN OUR CAR - Were heading upwards MACH 1 and
climbing Only now does Dominic look serious And John May
be nervous but he looks cool as a cucumber

Were goin 7 bells now 700 mph and rising

BUCK
Dynamite Road Should have a visual
any second

AT DYNAMITE ROAD CHECKPOINT - Our TEAM awaits for the moment
the PHOTOGRAPHER readies himself Then the visual And it
doesnt last long Its our ROCKET CAR and it comes FLASHING
BY Only theres absolutely SILENCE And just as fast as it
went by our team then covers their ears Because we saw the
lightning Now here comes the thunder - and it does roaring
behind the car like an aftershock

BOOOOOM
INT CAR -- CONTINUOUS

Its surreal Searing WHITE LIGHT everywhere Life at 10
frames per second 720721722723

Dominic contemplates his run He looks a little apprehensive
Almost frightened Weve maxed out at 730mph Is this ride
over

That GAUGE is maxed out in the RED

IN THE TENT - Tyler Gordon listens intently his record
seemingly safe

But Dominic looks as determined as ever

DOMINIC
(sotto)
Hows this for a heavy shoe

Dominic then makes a fateful decision instead of pulling
back on the throttle he hits it

We were sonic Now get ready for SUPERSONIC

Like a fifth gear - the monster really gives in
752753754755

IN THE TENT - Having passed 750 they all CHEER everybody
excited - save for ever the bridesmaid Tyler

BUCK
Congrats Dominic Youre still the
fastest man on Earth Lets bring
her back now

Oh and Mehgan too Shes holding her son tightly James
hoping this thing will be over soon

And back on Dynamite Road Dominic is still rising
784785786And that GAUGE is tipped off the scale

Yet all looks good for the moment Until the horrific - A

FLASH OF LIGHT off the REAR JET ENGINE immediately SHATTERS
THE TIRES

INSIDE THE CAR - A sudden drop of speed RED LIGHTS FLASHING
Now theyre dragging through the flat expanse SPARKS FLYING
INSIDE THE TENT - Panic

AT DYNAMITE ROAD - FIRE ENGULFS the entire rear of the
vehicle as it screams by

INSIDE THE CAR - Dominic desperately reaches toward the rear
trying to manually eject his sons seat But the G-force
from the spin making it nearly impossible to do

Then - an EXPLOSION - and we go SLO MO

As Dominic is automatically jettisoned from the vehicle
leaving his son in the SPECTACULAR FIREBALL

Dominics PARACHUTE deploys and he desperately searches the
ground terror seizing his face as he waits to land safely

INTERCUT - TENT - Where the mood is solemn A worried mother
and child A desperate friend

Dominic desperately peels away the charred refuse but drops
to his knees

DOMINIC

We already know the outcome And in a matter of a moment
Dominic will know what we already do His son is dead As
SIRENS begin to close in we leave Dominic with this
devastating realization

FADE OUT

INT OVAL OFFICE -- DAY
Insert Present day

Though dimly lit this office is the most luxurious youll
ever see And behind a spacious mahogany desk sits a very
lean handsome meticulously-suited MAN WILLIAM STEWART
Hes a young 50 salt and pepper mane determined look and
the commanding presence youd expect from the PRESIDENT OF
THE UNITED STATES

But look closer and youll see that this man is fraught with
worry And if he appears to have been up all night - its
because he has Hes knee-deep in a CLASSIFIED DOCUMENT a
SMALL STACK of the like next to him when his phones
INTERCOM interrupts him

SECRETARY (0S)
Mr President Theyre ready for
you

INT WHITE HOUSE HALLWAY -- MOMENTS LATER

Walking these corridors of power with a small phalanx of
security behind him is the President who carries a small
CLASSIFIED FILE They head towards an ENTRANCE where a PAIR
of MARINES stands post

WESTELL (0S)
-Having achieved its speed the
craft would be pre-navigated by
computer to return to its point of
origin

INT BRIEFING ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER

Where only some of the presidents MEN are here listening a
science ADVISOR his CHIEF OF STAFF and somebody we should
know Hes an arrogant intimidating sort the FOUR STAR
GENERAL SAMUEL BECKER 50ish who looks pissed that hes not
planning night raids in the Middle East A very competent
PROFESSOR RONALD WESTELL is in the middle of his brief

WESTELL
At this point any information
appropriated could be uploaded via
satellite Or given the technology
of the day we might be able to do
it from NASA headquarters or even
here

Theres silence and all eyes fall upon the President who
sits at the head of the long table After a moment of
silence he finally speaks

PRESIDENT
So no human contact

The professor wont answer that

CHIEF OF STAFF
That would be the idea sir

The President mulls this over

PRESIDENT
I dont like it

But to be fair the President looks at his advisors More
accurately at Becker

PRESIDENT
What do you think General

Becker does not flinch from the invitation And his manner
and tone suggest that he is not a fan of this program He
speaks in candor

BECKER
Mr President I think we’re
missing a larger opportunity here
For the tremendous amount of time
money and resources and in an age
of real security issues we should
we shouldn’t leave this weapon in
the hands of a pilot
(then)
Plus there’s no compelling data
that supports a manned craft Given
the uncertainty of the mission I
recommend we go virtual

PRESIDENT
(condescending)
You recommend

Becker doesn’t appreciate the slight But his opinion is
echoed

SCIENTIST
We dont know how human physiology
will react sir It may be too
traumatic
ADVISOR
And no human means no human error

Becker seems vindicated for the moment Until the President
addresses them

PRESIDENT

Or human touchgentlemen
They said the same thing when
people thought itd be safer to
send a chimpanzee to the moon
instead of men

(then emphatically to all)
We are on the edge of what was once
an inconceivable breakthrough A
technology that could change the
world as we know it Cure diseases
End famine Eliminate war Never
in the history of mankind has a
singular event meant so much to so
many Im not going to leave that
kind of responsibility up to a
machine or computer

Theres silence in the ranks as the Commander in Chief

on

PRESIDENT
NoIt will be a human thats
responsible Someone with the
depth drive and passion this
mission will take

This changes the mood of the room After a moment -

CHIEF OF STAFF
So youd like us to find you a
pilot Mr President

PRESIDENT
More than just a pilot Dan Think
outside the box

goes

This doesn’t sound the best of ideas - until the President

sells

PRESIDENT
The Wright Brothers made bikes for
a living Henry Ford was a farmer
And it was a doctor who first
broke the sound barrier Now there
are hundreds of qualified pilots
all over the country

(MORE)

PRESIDENT (contd)

But I want somebody more And I
think hes in this file This man
knows about loss And he’s a man
that knows about speed I want the
fastest man on Earth

The President tosses the FILE on the table partially
spilling its contents and revealing a PHOTO of DOMINIC
COLEMAN

CUT TO

EXT RURAL UTAHAUTO PARTS -- DAY

The sign may say “Auto Parts” but this GARAGE looks more like
the entrance into a junk yard IN THE LOT - About a half-
dozen cars are on blocks And we would swear the place was
empty if we didn’t hear Loretta Lynn’s “Wine Women and Song”
coming from the GARAGE

INT GARAGE -- CONTINUOUS

It’s organized in that filthy chaotic kind of way most AUTO
GARAGES are But notice near the RADIO where Loretta belts
from a PHONE is off its hook

And here he is under the HOOD of a souped-up ‘74 Chevy Vega
The fastest man on Earth And it’s hard to believe this is
the same man we met earlier This Dominic Coleman not only
lacks the swagger and confidence of his younger days he
looks defeated

As Dominic works we hear a CAR pull up

And exiting a ‘65 MUSTANG FASTBACK TWO AND TWO is a handsome
man we met as a boy JAMES who’s seemed to adopt his
father’s old persona strong and confident He approaches the
garage and stares at Dad for a moment

JAMES
You always gotta listen to this old
stuff

DOMINIC

The old stuff is the good stuff
Well see if years from now people
are still listening to Madonna and
U2

JAMES
Got news for you pa They’re old
too

Dominic finishes his work shuts the hood then moves to a
COUNTER to wipe his hands James notices the PHONE and shakes
his head

JAMES
You know ma is trying to get a hold
of you

This doesn’t mean much to Dominic

JAMES
I’ve been trying to get a hold of
you too

This means even less

DOMINIC
How are the kids doing

JAMES
They’re okay Worried about JJ

thoughHe reminds me of you
Back in the day

Off dad’s look

JAMES
He likes speed

After a moment James simply gives up

JAMES
I gotta go
(then)
Go see mom Or call her or
something

With that James exits And only when he finally does
Dominic turns to watch him drive away

CuT TO

EXT DOMINIC’S HOUSE -- DAY -- ESTABLISHING

This is a classic COLONIAL that sits on acres of land
Adjacent to the HOUSE is a massive BARN On the GRAVEL
DRIVEWAY leading to it we see a car driving up

EXT FRONT DOOR COLEMAN HOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER

Where Dominic KNOCKS A moment later Mehgan opens the DOOR
She seems mildly surprise at seeing Dominic standing there
But she does not offer to let him in

DOMINIC
James said you were trying to get a
hold of me

MEHGAN

You got a phone call from the
government Sounded important Like
a job or something

DOMINIC
What’d you tell’em

MEHGAN
I gave’em your address

Dominic becomes agitated

DOMINIC
I’m not doing anything Meg

MEHGAN
I’m not asking you to

DOMINIC
I’m serious These people keep
coming around asking me to go
back I’M NOT GOING BACK

MEHGAN
Fine

DOMINIC
I just wanna be left alone You
know that But you keep trying to
push me back into something -

MEHGAN
I’m not trying anything -

DOMINIC
I just want to live out my life Is
that asking so much

MEHGAN
I KNOW DOMINIC

Dominic is silenced

MEHGAN
I get it
(then)
And nobody’s trying to get you to
go back YOUVE NEVER LEFTYou’ve
been stuck in the past while we’ve
all moved on

These words may hurt but they are the truth and Dominic
knows it Then his head drops in shame eliciting sympathy
from Meg

MEHGAN
Youre not the only one that misses
him Dominic I forgave you a long
time ago So did James and
everybody else You gotta forgive
yourself

Dominic looks at Mehgan almost begging to come in But it

looks like that ship has sailed unfortunately He accepts
this and exits

INT SALOON -- DAY

This is Boulevard of Broken Dreams - Southwest style where
a handful of flyboys and drinkers are forgetting their
problems And fitting in perfectly is Dominic saddled up at
the bar by himself with a bourbonrocks

EXT CEMETERY -- EVENING

Where Dominic stands before his sons GRAVESITE It is a
simple TOMBSTONE JOHN GERARD COLEMAN BROTHER SON April

Sadly Dominic reaches to the MEDALLION that still hangs off
his neck

CROSSFADE

EXT DOMINIC’S AUTO PARTSGARAGE -- DAY

Back to Dominic’s solitary business of working on cars when a
dark sedan pulls up with government issued PLATES

This time Dominic is underneath a car when a PAIR of legs
are heard walking towards him

G MAN (0S)
Dominic Coleman

Dominic pulls himself from under the ride and sees a pair of
real Hoover-types staring at him

G MAN 1
Wed like to have a word with you

INT GARAGE WORK BENCH -- MOMENTS LATER

Where the three are now standing The pitch has just been
given and all are waiting on Dominic’s response

DOMINIC
I don’t think so gentleman You

over about a dozen qualified
pilots

G MAN 1
Oh weve foundem Mr Coleman
But this isnt a test In fact
the President himself has requested
you specifically for this program

The President

DOMINIC
Why would he ask for me

G MAN 1
You still hold the national land
record And this is a similar
speed program

DOMINIC
What kind Transonic Hypersonic
‘Cause Ive already done it

The G MAN leans in

G MAN 1
I guarantee you Mr Coleman
(dramaticsmiling)
You ain ever been this fast

With this promise there is a glint of curiosity in Dominic’s
eyes

CuT TO

EXT PROVING GROUNDS MILITARY BASE -- DAY

This is home to some of the governments most classified
programs including the top secret NATIONAL CENTER FOR LIGHT
AND AERONAUTICS (NCLA)

INT HALLWAY -- MOMENTS LATER

It looks like LANGLY Nothing but MILITARY BRASS and suits
walking these halls of power Near the end of the hall
MARINES stand guard at an ELEVATOR Dominic is ushered in by
SECURITY

INT ELEVATOR -- CONTINUOUS

Dominic looks overwhelmed for the moment doesnt know what
to think Then the door slides open revealing an older (and
heavier) but still well-preserved BUCK OSHEA Surprise
he’s eating

DOMINIC
Buck

BUCK
The fastest man on Earth

They hug happy to be reunited again Dominic studies Buck
with a look of apprehension

BUCK
Yeah I put on few pounds

DOMINIC
A few You look like you swallowed
a Mitubishi

BUCK
(to G men)
Ill take him from here

As the pair proceed through the basement we realize this is
no ordinary project The technology down here is something
weve never seen LASER ROOMS MINIATURE PARTICLE COLLIDERS
THRONGS OF ENGINEERS in lab coats

BUCK
So damn how have you been

DOMINIC
Im good

BUCK
Meg and James

DOMINIC
Theyre okay What is this What
are you doing here

BUCK
This Has been my life for the
last three years

DOMINIC
Gave up the salt tracks
BUCK
Off one track onto the other

(then)
Its a special program Right up
your alley DC As a matter of
fact the President himself has
requested your participation

EXT CONFERENCE ROOM -- CONTINUOUS
Our PAIR has reached the DOUBLE DOORS to a conference room
DOMINIC
Yeah thats what I heard But why
would the President request me
BUCK
I dont know
(smiling flatly)

You can ask him yourself

The DOOR is opened and the pair walk in

INT CONFERENCE ROOM -- CONTINUOUS

And there via a VIDEO MONITOR that sits in the center of a
LONG TABLE is PRESIDENT COLEMAN

PRESIDENT
Hello Mr Coleman Come

This is too surreal for Dominic He approaches slowly taking
note of the WALL CAMERAS and SECURITY

INT WHITE HOUSE OVAL OFFICE -- CONTINUOUS

POV PRESIDENT -- CONTINUOUS

Who watches the various monitors as Dominic makes his way in
front of the monitor

PRESIDENT
Sit
(then)
Im Bill Stewart Nice to meet you
Mr Coleman

Despite his power his accessibility is endearing

DOMINIC
DC You can call me DC

The President smiles

PRESIDENT
DC

INTERCUT CONFERENCE ROOM - As Dominic sits before the SCREEN
The President then begins

PRESIDENT
I imagine your first question is
what this is all about

It is And the President begins

PRESIDENT
Speed DC
(then)
Since the moment man could move
weve been trying to do it faster
and faster From the wheel to the
locomotive to the engine to the
jet to the rocketit’s always
been about speed
(then)
And now this What the Defense
Department may think this is a
waste of money I see as an
opportunityTo take the
technology from the future and
bring it to the present Something
that’s always been an impossible
dreamUntil now

Dominic doesn’t understand

DOMINIC
What’s this have to do with me
sir

PRESIDENT

I was wondering that myself DC
until I read your file You were
a damn good test pilot In fact
your land speed record still
stands

(then)
But more importantly I chose you
because you have an intangible that
Im looking for

Dominic waits to hear what this is

PRESIDENT
You know what its like to lose a
sonAnd I do too

(off Dominics silence)

As you may know my son has a very
rare disease that has been killing
him for the first 12 years of his
life He wont live past fifteen
Ironically this disease will be
fully curable within the decade
But unfortunately for my son that
will be too late Now I ask you
would you have done anything to
save your son

Dominic thinks

DOMINIC
Yes I would have

The President smiles Dominic isnt sure what hes asking
yet He looks to Buck who reassures him with a nod

PRESIDENT
You called yourself fastest man on
Earth at one time

DOMINIC
A long time ago

The President leans in selling dramatically

PRESIDENT
Well howd you like the title
back

(MORE )

PRESIDENT (contd)

Go faster than ALL THE MEN whove

ever raced in ALL THE VEHICLES in

the all the world FOR ALL TIME
(then)

A speed so fast it can only be

measured by theory space and

time

DOMINIC
How fast are we talking Mr
President

The President then leans in dramatically

PRESIDENT
Id like you to pilot a vehicle for
me DC that will go the speed of

light

Dominic looks to Buck This is for real

INT ELEVATOR -- MOMENTS LATER

Dominic looks gopsmacked incredulous Thankfully Buck is
there to talk to

DOMINIC
(incredulous)
A time machine

BUCK
Its not science fiction Dominic
Its physics
(then)
Look I know how it sounds But you
leave the science to us All we
need is a pilot okay

Dominics wavering uncertain

BUCK

Youll be trained by the best of
the best And everybody has the
same goal

(then)
But one thing This is the
governments most highly classified
program The pentagons top brass
doesnt even know about this Need
I remind you keep a lid on it

CuT TO

EXT COLEMAN’S HOUSE FRONT PORCH -- NIGHT

We’ve been here before Dominic KNOCKING on the front door
But he’s a little more self-assured now A moment later the
door swings open It’s Mehgan

DOMINIC
I can’t
(off her look)
Forgive myself

Mehgan studies him This time Dominic will be let in

EXT COLEMAN’S HOUSE BACKYARD -- MOMENTS LATER

Underneath the stars Mehgan and Dominic sit quietly on a
YARD SWING There may be a disconnect but there’s still love
there For the first time since we’ve seen him after the
accident Dominic seems to be opening up

DOMINIC
A piece of me died that day Meg
He would’ve been 26 nowI feel
like I’m still there Right at that
moment And I can’t move forward

MEHGAN
You can’t move forward Dominic if
you keep running away You know you
lost a son that day But I lost a
son and a husband And James lost a
father

This is the truth And it applies an even heavier guilt than
Dominic already carries

DOMINIC
It hurt to be around you And I
couldn’t look at James

MEHGAN
Because he reminded you of John

DOMINIC
NoBecause he reminded me of me

Dominic looks sorry but helpless

DOMINIC
I just feel if I can do this one
thingmaybe I can begin to move
forward

Mehgan understands
MEHGAN
If you’re going to do it just talk
to James before you go He deserves
to know

MUSIC UP - AND OVER A SERIES OF SHOTS - Of Dominic preparing
for his mission

- Dr Mimm Anderson tutors Dominic with the aid of an
OVERHEAD PROJECTOR Complicated equations of relativity and
thrust are projected onto a SCREEN

- Dominic sits in the WELLS 3 SIMULATOR an identical
reproduction of the actual cockpit hell be manning Dallas
Trent next to him explaining each GAUGE

- Dominic taking a stress test hooked up to number of
ELECTRODES monitoring his heart pulse etc A TRAINER next
to him pushing him to his physical limit

- In what looks like a CLASSROOM Dominic is seated front and
center as Buck is explaining the EQUATION for LIGHT SPEED

- At home its craziness again Dominic holding his
grandchild going over the equations he has learned with his
ever-ambitious son James Their wives and other children in
the background

- In the MEDIA CENTER Rowdy Bennington is going over a MAP
of NEW MEXICOUTAH with Dominic On a VIDEO SCREEN is the
acronym SURVIVE Rowdy explains

ROWDY
Size up your situation Use your
senses Remember your mission
Vanquish fear Improvise Value

- In the FUSION ROOM Dominic watches from behind glass the
ENGINEERS in full RADIATION SUITS at work Schematics of the
WELLS 3 system are plastered about the place with warning
signs everywhere This is clearly NUCLEAR

BUCK
You didnt think it ran on
gasoline did you

INT MEDIA CENTER -- DAY

CLOSE ON - SLIDE-SCREEN - A MAN mid 40s His long hair and
dark good looks are unbecoming of his doctors status

BUCK
This is Dr Steven Timmis was head
of the Mayo Clinics genetic
research and engineering for almost
a decade

Dominic is seated before the screen studying the picture as
Buck continues to educate

BUCK
Hes been working on a cure for the
presidents son for the past four
years out of a classified location
in Salt Lake City and is on the
precipice of the diseases
discovery

- And Dominic is monitored doing a complicated handeye
coordination test Remarkably he seems quite competent even
impressing the SCIENTISTS who monitor him

- Testing G-FORCE - in what looks like an amusement park
ride Dominic is being spun at incredible speed

POV BECKER -- CONTINUOUS

Who watches with THROUGH THE GLASS hatred coursing through
his veins He stands next to another well-decorated but dour
GENERAL Think Dick Cheney wearing Colin Powell’s uniform

BECKER
(grumbling)
Thirty percent of our defense
budget And they’re handing it toa
civilian

A different thought is occurring to the General

GENERAL
Maybe it’s time you stop looking at
this as a waste of money And start
looking at it as an opportunity

With that the General walks away leaving with Becker with
food for thought

CROSSFADE

INT MILITARY HOSPITAL ROOM -- NIGHT

Where here the reason lay asleep Hes a slender cherubic
BOY laying in what looks like the most antiseptic setting
imaginable a room quarantined by transparent walls

ADJACENT to his bed a PLASTIC ENSCONCED ARM with HAND
reaches through the wall and tenderly rubs the boys back
awakening him Its the President

PRESIDENT
Hey champ

The boy smiles wearily before fading back to rest

ON THE OTHER SIDE OF WALL - The President is with his
attractive wife HELEN sharing a brief moment together in
front of their ailing son Both look fraught with concern
But the President is on the verge of tears as he pulls his
arm out

PRESIDENT
My own son and I cant even hold
him

Helen leans her head on his shoulder comforting him

HELEN
(whispering)
You will some day And so will I
(then)
You have to believe that

PRESIDENT
I do

Helen studies her husband with penetrating eyes
HELEN

Do you think youre doing the right
thing

PRESIDENT
I dont knowSometimes I think
were tampering with something that
we shouldnt But then I think of
him

We may only get one shot at this

CROSSFADE

INT COMPUTER ROOM -- CONTINUOUS

Dr Mimm Anderson mans the computers where a series of TIME
LINES appear on the MONITORS On one of the MONITORS a
computer simulation of time passage is generated and
explained

BUCK
»Once you achieve light speed
every four seconds you travel will
be the equivalent of one years
Earth time You then must maintain
the 186 thousand mile per second
speed MANUALLY

On Buck

BUCK
DO NOT DEVIATE The Wells 3 is
equipped with an atomic timer set
to go off 24 seconds into
lightspeed When it goes off you
must pull out immediately

INT SIMULATOR -- CONTINUOUS

You wouldnt know but Dominic is in simulated space now
traveling what looks like their vision of the speed of light

BUCK
It takes 8 minutes for the suns
light to reach the Earth
Traveling light speed in your
journey you will be no farther from
the Earth than the moon On your
first trip you will be traveling
away from the sun

(MORE)
BUCK (contd)

Mark your course using the Wells
3s navigation system

The simulator drops out of light speed and Dominic

course via the mock-controls

BUCK
You should have a visual on our
planet -

Dominic does so And we move towards EARTH

BUCK
Once at the point of re-entry you
will rendezvous with our space
station to receive all of the
pertinent information to be
downloaded for your return
flight

marks his

With the help of Dallas Trent Dominic navigates the WELLS 3

simulator towards a SPACE STATION

INTERCUT -- BACK TO MEDIA CENTER -- CONTINUOUS
Where Buck is speaking to Dominic

BUCK

It is here you will then retrieve
the necessary information from the
NCLA There will be NO CONTACT
between you and the future world
After the retrieval proceed back
to your end mark and make your
return flight with the suns
gravity

(then)
IT IS IMPERATIVE that you can not
travel at the speed of light for
more than the allotted time If
the ships atomic clock
malfunctions you must manually
abort IMMEDIATELY

This seems a quite a bit to handle But Dominic looks game-

worthy

DOMINIC
Or what

This is the 64 thousand dollar question

BUCK
Youll go back in time

CuT TO

INT ELEVATOR -- LATER

As Dominic waits in the elevator General Becker enters just
as the doors are about to close Even silent the Colonel is
one imposing man After an uncomfortable moment he breaks
his silence

BECKER
Mr Coleman I want you to
understand something the speed of
light is a weapon unlike the world
has ever known Like the Atomic
bomb of years ago or todays
stealth fighter it will ensure our
military superiority for
generations It is a weapon

The DOOR OPENS and Dominic moves to exit but Becker blocks
him with his arm -

BECKER
And make no mistake Mr Coleman I
take my weapons very seriously

Becker stares down Dominic before allowing him to pass

CROSSFADE

INT BUCKS CAR MOVING -- NIGHT

Both men are quietly lost in thought As Buck pulls over to
stop before Dominic gets out he leans in looks like he
needs to speak his mind

BUCK

(with difficulty)
DomYou know theres another
aspect of the mission we havent
talked about

(off Dominics attention)
Thats the ethics of light speed

(then)
Now I know what youve been
thinking and you cant
(go back in time and change
history )

This is a one way trip
(MORE )

BUCK (contd)

You can only return at the point of
origin And even if you
couldlight speedtime
travelis more disruptive to the
order of things than cloning or
anything man has ever done And if
you miss your mark on the re-entry
youll be messing with the
Almightys spacetime continuum
And I dont know what that will do
But I do know this Aman can not
have two souls

Buck cant explain but we get the urgency And so does
Dominic who gently nods his head Dominic gets out of the
car and Buck watches him leave not fully convinced that he
understands

CROSSFADE

INT DOMINICS BEDROOM -- NIGHT

A spartan room almost a studio In bed a thoughtful Dominic
is wide awake thinking about Buck’s words After a moment
he reaches out to his BEDSTAND and picks up a PHOTOGRAPH

EXT ROCKET CAR GARAGE SALT LAKE CITY -- DAY

Its a beehive of activity with PROTOTYPES taken out and
towed in JEEPS rolling by Dominic makes his way towards the
GARAGE and for the first time since the accident he seems to
have purpose

INT GARAGE -- CONTINUOUS

About a DOZEN JET-FUELED CARS at varying degrees of assembly
are scattered about with workers hovering around them In
the middle of the hanger is a sleek TURBO JET THRUSTER with
TYLER GORDONS GREEN CLAD MECHANICS working it Tyler makes
eye-contact with Dominic No words spoken but a nod of his
head out of respect

NEAR one of the CARS is JAMES who works away while listening
to music via his headphones

POV DOMINIC -- CONTINUOUS

Who watches his son with buried pride

Dominic wants to approach his son but he can not muster the
courage to do so After a moment he simply slips away And

James is never the wiser

CROSSFADE

EXT MILITARY BASE TESTING GROUNDS -- MORNING

It couldnt be a more beautiful day 75 Not a cloud in
sight And nestled up to a HUB parked majestically between a
half DOZEN F-14s is a SPACE SHUTTLE

INT NATIONAL CENTER FOR LIGHT AND AERONAUTICS -- CONTINUOUS

A beehive of activity where a DOZEN TECHNICIANS are situated
NASA-style The technology here coupled with the
professionalism ensures us that nothing will be left to
chance Buck is the Queenbee surveying the BIG SCREEN
MONITOR that charters the course for WELLS 3

OVERSEEING THE CENTER -- Military brass is present and led
by a very anxious COLONEL BECKER

INT DRESSING ROOM -- CONTINUOUS

As Dominic appraises himself in the mirror mentally
preparing himself He is now wearing a snug neoprene body
suit black as anthracite Nothing but the American Flag and
his name stitched into it Captain Dominic Coleman

As he does so often when summoning courage he touches the
AMULET around his neck Its go time

EXT HALLWAY LEADING TO SHIP -- MOMENTS LATER

Dominic is proceeding towards the GATE leading to the SHUTTLE
where he is saluted by a PAIR OF SERVICEMEN that stand post

INT HALL LEADING TO WELLS 3 -- CONTINUOUS

Dominic walks solemnly towards the shuttles entrance where
Buck awaits

BUCK
Welcome to the WELLS 3

DOMINIC
I wont ask what happened to the
Wells one and two

BUCK
Remember youre here to make
history not change it Godspeed

Dominic smiles and the two old friends shake No hug
Dominic then enters into a darkened HULL and the SHUTTLE
DOORS are SEALED behind him

INT HULL -- CONTINUOUS

It may be dark but inside this hull is the hatch to the
spacecraft WELLS 3 We cant see it just yet but Dominic
climbs in

INT WELLS 3 -- CONTINUOUS

From what we can make of it this doesnt look unlike the
COCKPIT of a fighter jet - but without the full gallimaufry
of switches and gauges In fact its quite Spartan Dominic
takes his seat front and center places on his HELMET pulls
its attached MIC into place Its like hes back in the

Where pilots TUCKER TAYLOR and DALLAS TRENT man the controls
of what looks to be a rudimentary take-off for them

TUCKER
Thank you ground control
Attention passengers The seat
belt sign is on you are not free
to walk about the cabin This is a
non-smoking flight If we catch
you removing any smoke detectors on

INT WELLS 3 -- CONTINUOUS
As Dominic listens in smiling

DOMINIC
Is there an in flight movie

DALLAS
No movie Cargo But theres some
salted peanuts on the dash and
youll get quite a view at the bus
stop

The PILOTS then initiate take-off and the SHUTTLE begins
speeding down the runway

Inside WELLS 3 the cabin shakes as the shuttle picks up
speed

OUTSIDE - We watch as it accelerates down the RUNWAY - and
theres LIFTOFF the shuttle smoothly rising into flight

EXT RURAL ROAD -- CONTINUOUS

Where Dominics FAMILY have driven and are watching the
SHUTTLE rocketing upwards towards the firmament

All in GROUND CONTROL all are seriously listening in
Although this is years of work coming to its fulfillment it
could also be a catastrophe After all the engines that
drive the WELLS 3 are nothing shy of NUCLEAR BOMBS

Yet inside the WELLS 3 Dominic waits patiently in his seat
He may look calm and cool but as he reaches out to clutch
the AMULET ST JOSEPH we know otherwise

Inside the SHUTTLE its all business another THRUST is
triggered

But Dominic is in the dark waiting listening

SHHHHWEWWWWWWWWW

Were going up up UP Pulling away from the planet soaring
towards the stratus And suddenly theres a VIOLENT JARRING
within the ship making it VIBRATE so furiously that it
HUMMS

DALLAS
Hitting a little turbulence on the
entry ground

Its starting to get a little scary in the WELLS 3 for a
second shaking and bumping when just as suddenly - IT
STOPS

And the Shuttle is smoothly flying on the outer edge of the
atmosphere

SHUTTLE PILOT 1
Ground control Resurrection has
made its mark and is prepared for
drop

The Shuttles HULL begins to OPEN beneath the SPACECRAFT

We may be moving at about 1400 mph but this looks like slo-
motion as the WELLS 3 slips out drifting beneath the
Shuttle As it drops into full view we finally get to see
the WELLS 3 in all its engineering majesty Make no bones
its like no spacecraft weve ever seen A hybrid of sorts a
DIMINUTIVE STEALTH FIGHTER on steroids Small sleek and
sinewy at the front end gradually increasing in muscle
towards the rear where a trinity of NUCLEAR ENGINES power it

INT WELLS 3 -- CONTINUOUS

Now Dominic finally gets the magnificent view he was promised
- our PLANET EARTH its turquoise oval sphere luminescent

DOMINIC
(sotto)
Good God

Spectacular from above We can see the WEST COAST of North
America and the horizontal shadow that divides day from
night As Dominic admires this -

TUCKER (0S)
Were gonna get this bus back into

Dominic is momentarily lost in the beauty of the view as the
space shuttle RESURRECTION moves out of sight

Dominic thinks for a second now focused on the task at hand
the speed of light All at GROUND CONTROL are listening in

DOMINIC
Yes I am
(then)
Lets tip this cow

Dominic then reaches out and initiates the first non-nuclear
THRUST and the ship bursts forward rocketeering into the
vast expanse of space Even minus its atomic power - this
ship is the fastest ever built

At the CONTROL CENTER the MONITORS chart the ships speed
But not in miles per hour Miles per second Were only a
few hundred in but rising fast

INTERCUT - WELL 3

BUCK
Can you here me

Obviously Dominic can But hes not listening Instead he
reaches forward and begins punching numbers on the KEYPAD at
his CONSOLE This triggers a series of tests lights
blinking radiation indicators external pressure
temperature

You can hear the CHURNING of the NUCLEAR REACTION about to
take place It begins with a low steady flat bass

And the TRINITY OF ENGINES ignite blazing BRIGHT ORANGE
GASSES spinning from within Its as if the power of the sun
has been harnessed here and is about to be unleashed

Theres an eerie calmness for the moment before the nuclear
reaction begins - and we can see it MILLIONS and MILLIONS

of PHOTONS QUARKS ELECTRONS PROTONS swirling about from

within the engines

Dominic sits readied hand on the THROTTLE that will push the
speed of the WELLS 3 into HYPERSPACE

Then the particles begin to COLLAPSE and COLLIDE with one
another The ship is pushed forward ever so slightly like a
car in too high of gear

ALL AT THE COMMAND CENTER wait with breathless anticipation
Until finally the inevitable - A CHAIN REACTION

DOMINIC
Marking Atomic clock at 3 2 1

Like a VOLCANIC ERUPTION the TRINITY OF ENGINES EXPLODE in a
spectacular detonation shooting out a LASER PRISM of LIGHT
and COLOR

The WELLS 3 reaction is simultaneous firing forward with a
MATRIX-LIKE bullet blast into the deep

Inside the WELLS 3 theres a look of apprehension on
Dominics face Gone is the determination we saw out in the
Salt Flats In fact he looks downright frightened

THE SPEEDOMETER - is off the chain 206080thousand
mps and exponentially rising

AT THE COMMAND CENTER - Communication is no longer possible
Buck and his crew can only wait and watch

TECHNICIAN 1
Sir approaching 100 thousand

Thats miles per second

IN THE WELLS 3 - No sign of slowing down though it is
getting hot in here Dominic surveys the ships vitals
Temperature on the outside is stable Inside About 90 Not
dangerous - yet

As the spacecraft Wells 3 races through the void like a
celestial hydroplane it leaves a ZIPPER LIKE WAVE in its
wake

But INSIDE THE SHIP - Were at 131000 mps and maxing out

INTERCUT - CONTROL CENTER

TECHNICIAN 1
Sir Stabilizing at 133

ON BUCK - Who seems to understand whats happening

BUCK
Hes gotta break the Suns gravity
Itll be okay
(sotto)
Come on Dominic

INTERCUT - SPACE - As the Wells 3 blasts towards us we can
see the mighty SUN behind it But its about to be eclipsed
by the Earth

INSIDE THE WELLS 3 - Its over 100s degrees in here now and
Dominic is feeling it profusely sweating The SPEEDOMETER
has maxed out at 137000 mps And the ship seems to be
struggling like a TRUCK moving uphill

But the hope is with the SUN soon to be FULLY ECLIPSED any
moment the WELLS 3 will be released from its gravitational
pull and accelerate forward with one final burst

And so we watchAs the temperature inside rises

The SPEEDOMETER not only grounded but retreating
135764134721133650

And EARTH ever so slowly shading the SUN behind it

INTERCUT - COMMAND CENTER
TECHNICIAN 1
(concerned)

Sir the interior temperature is
searing
BUCK
Shell hold
(sotto)
Cmon Dom Hang in there

INTERCUT - WELLS 3 - Where the temp is now upward 120
seemingly unbearable

Just as the last RAY OF LIGHT is eclipsed its as ifa
mountain has just been climbed Because the moment the WELLS
3 clears the light of the suns gravity - BOOM

We jump to 140000 mps and rising

INTERCUT - COMMAND CENTER - Theyre cheering

And INSIDE THE WELLS 3 - Temperature is going back down as
the speed keeps going up

152143158935164277

IN SPACE - All we can see is the DISTANT STARS as suddenly a

swath of energy pierces the cosmos The Wells 3 is traveling
so fast its invisible

INTERCUT - COMMAND CENTER

TECHNICIAN 1
Sir 18

Only six thousand more But then suddenly - NOTHING

POWER OUTAGE

INSIDE THE WELLS 3 - Theres no sign of letting up in this
ship And the view Imagine an OCEAN with every color of the
spectrum parting before you like Moses before the RED SEA

183155184933185471
AT THE COMMAND CENTER - Panic sets in What happened

And then the incredible Remember that wall of air out in the
Salt Flats Well multiply it by a thousand Because up
ahead is SPACE NEGATIVE Where the vast expanse of darkness
is now becoming albescent and the stars that light up heavens
are dimming

185773185821185900

The ship itself is now becoming albescent the entire
spectrum of LIGHT and COLOR coursing through it

But as we inch towards that magic number LIGHT starts to
collapse into the ship like a horizon sunset - only at
breakneck speed It begins with the COLORS all of them in
staccato like fashion BLUES GREENS YELLOWS all sucked in
and out of sight until we are left with nothing but a
negative film void of any shade

INSIDE THE COMMAND CENTER - Theres confusion Worry All are
waiting with breathless anticipation scrambling for power
nobody knowing what to expect

AND ON THE WELLS - AS IT HAPPENS - 186000 mps

The ship WELLS 3 barely visible fades into the BRIGHTEST
LIGHT ever By now all the stars of the sky are a direct
contrast to the space between them theyre all jet-black
Everything the SUN MOON PLANETS

AND INSIDE THE SHIP - Dominic can actually touch the light
around him It bends to his whim floats before him
surrounding him like spirit

And the ATOMIC CLOCK begins to move forward Slowly at first
days months years 072707031808050909

As the SPEED keeps increasing 190000191193197000

EXT SALT FLATS -- CONTINUOUS

Empty Peaceful But up in the sky This LIGHT WAVE looks
like a RIP At first it seems no bigger than something left
behind a SKYWRITER But this RIP stretches across the SKY
As if the cosmos is being cut with a giant razor

In fact all over the country this RIP can be seen Its
something of a PHENOMENA

EXT NEW YORK CITY MANHATTAN -- CONTINUOUS

Where its grabbing everyones attention causing CAR
ACCIDENTS All CIVILIANS are LOOKING UP

EXT ST LOUIS MO -- CONTINUOUS

High above the ARCH the RIP is commanding attention here as
well

All over the country Los Angeles Dallas Seattle are
experiencing the same - a HORIZONTAL TEAR cutting across the
sky

The RIP can even be seen in the dark skies above PARIS
MADRID ROME JAPAN

There seems to be a problem For the moment Because the
speed of light is natures last law not meant to be broken
It comes with a cosmic retribution You thought a SONIC BOOM
was big Get ready for a SOLAR BANG

IN SPACE all that is left behind from the WELLS 3 is A LIGHT
WAVE extending across the heavens

The LIGHT WAVE calmly retracts and FADES AWAY But before
completely disappearing it explodes like astronomical
tsunami rolling throughout the cosmos At first it seems
to restore the nature of things Stars light up color is
returned space dims to the void that it is

But the second SHOCK WAVE is apocalyptic rocking the sky
with an enormous magnetic swell - sweeping over everything
including our planet

ON EARTH - the RIP in the sky SEPARATES and a FLOOD OF LIGHT
pours through it as if a giant dam has been broken The light
cascades out blasting over the globe in one instant FLASH -
as if God has taken a photograph

AT THE COMMAND CENTER - the room goes dark before MONITORS
EXPLODE Screams of panic ring out as -

The LIGHT WAVE washes over the entire planet

EMERGENCY SIRENS SOUND OFF

INT WELLS 3 -- CONTINUOUS

Dominic is still in HYPERSPACE Hes concentrating on the
SPEED Not the ships ATOMIC CLOCK - TIME BLAZING FORWARD
042508073111

Dominic readies himself to pull on the throttle but he cant
bring himself to Hes having a flashback to that fated day
in Bonneville

FLASHBACK —- SALT FLATS OF BONNEVILLE -- YEARS AGO

As a younger Dominic is about to pull back on the throttle
but doesnt

Dominic looks disoriented as the ATOMIC CLOCK continues
onward Then finally it goes BLANK and the NUCLEAR ENGINES
shut down

IN SPACE - The WELLS 3 suddenly appears from within the
ENERGY WAVE its created

INTERCUT -- WELLS 3 -- The temperature has inexplicably
dropped leaving the entire ships interior with a thin coat
of ICE Dominic chips away at the console trying to figure
out what might have happened

INTERCUT - COMMAND CENTER

Where the entire room has been BURNED OUT But despite the
pluming smoke off broken monitors and small fires these men
and women are professionals already in moving into damage
control For Buck this was not a monumental failure It was
a monumental loss He looks devastated His first order of
business is to call it in

BUCK
(to an engineer)
Get me the President on the phone

As Buck waits for the call notice the look of vindication on
Becker’s face As we -

FADE OUT

INT WELLS 3 -- LATER

Approaching Earth now - and it appears normal But up ahead
the GARGANTUAN SPACE STATIONATMOPORT is nestled between the
atmosphere and space It sits suspended on the stratus like
a GIANT FUNNEL ships taking off and landing on it

DOMINIC
(sotto)
Good God

As Dominic tries to comprehend this - radio silence is broken
and a HOLOGRAM APPEARS in front of his ship It is a middle
aged BLACK MALE dressed in military command uniform This is
COMMANDER WORTHY

COMMANDER
Attention spacecraft You are
violating International Airspace
Identify yourself

DOMINIC
This is Wells 3 Requesting
permission toapproach

The HOLOGRAM disappears for a moment SILENCE Then returns

COMMANDER
Identification number

Number What number

The HOLOGRAM FIGURE flashes a VERTICAL LASER into the Wells
3 scanning it much to Dominics amazement

As the Wells 3 drifts into the GIANT FUNNEL its obvious we
ain in 2007 no more HUNDREDS of MODERN FIGHTER JETS are
DOCKED along the sides and it has a WIDOWS WALK that runs
across it

COMMANDER
Wells 3 you are unidentified and
will be categorized hostile if
you do not dock immediately

DOMINIC
Look Im an American and this is
an American spacecraft Call the
NCLA

COMMANDER
Non compliance will result in
international tribunal

As the Commander drones on Dominic studies the HOLOGRAM
closer Along its side run a series of calculations and

information But what grabs his attention is the last line
04182020

Dominic then realizes that he passed his mark

COMMANDER
Do you choose to comply

Dominic becomes lost in thought

DOMINIC
(sotto)
Lets seeSize up my situation

COMMANDER
COMPLY OR WE WILL TAKE ACTION

DOMINIC
Doesnt look too goodUse my
senses

WEAPONS ARE DRAWN and concentrated on the Wells 3

DOMINIC
Im usinem I thinkRemember my
mission

COMMANDER

This is your final warning

DOMINIC
Value my life

And with no other choice

DOMINIC
Improvise

Dominic simply flips the THRUST on the console blasting
through the hologram

SHOTS are fired at the WELLS 3 as it takes off but this
thing is the MILLENNIUM FALCON on crank Its so fast its
out the other end of the funnel before the shots come near
it

INT WELLS 3 -- CONTINUOUS

Adrenaline fuels Dominic as he desperately navigates his way
out

EXT SKY CLOUDY RAINY NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS

The Wells 3 may have made it out of the SPACE FUNNEL and into
the Earths atmosphere but about HALF A DOZEN FIGHTER JETS
are mobilizing out

DOMINIC
VANQUISH YOUR FEARS

Easier said than done As Dominic tries to get a bearing of
where he is searches the sky his RADAR goes off INCOMING

A MISSILE at THREE OCLOCK

Dominic makes a desperate move dropping the Wells 3 into a
helix maneuver to avoid the MISSILE And by the time he
recovers his craft at least four of the ships are on his
tail - and his RADAR is going off again

DOMINIC
(sotto)
Alright Thats what you
wantLets see how you handle
atomic

This is a no-no But Dominic reaches out and punches it
anyway

The Wells 3s acceleration is so intense that it blasts a
WALL OF AIR from its wake rattling his pursuers violently
off course - and sending him to speeds never achieved on
Earth But it also renders the Wells 3 virtually
uncontrollable

INT WELLS 3 -- CONTINUOUS

Hypersky No longer in a vacuum the Wells 3 can not
structurally take the heat or friction of this incredible
speed It looks like its going to explode

ALERTS - ring out on the CONSOLE

Dominic reaches out to kill the atomic thrust but its too
late now Hes moving too fast and out of control

FROM THE GROUND - The Wells 3 looks like a streaking METEOR

BACK IN THE WELLS 3

All looks hopeless for the moment but somehow Dominic
manages to PULL UP with all his might and steady the craft
scouring the ground for a safe place to land while struggling
with the controls HE HITS the SWITCH for EMERGENCY BRAKE

And the A PAIR OF JET THRUSTS on the WINGS blast out
Dominics SHOULDER BELT keeps him from smashing into the
WINDSHIELD - but thankfully the WELLS 3 is now not only
manageable but with the navigation system working Dominic
seems to know where to go

CROSSFADE

EXT RURAL UTAH JUST OUTSIDE SALT FLATS -- DAWN

Out here its still the middle of nowhere And here comes
the WELLS 3 - a little too fast

EXT RURAL UTAH -- CONTINUOUS

Where the Wells 3 is rocketing downwardcolliding into the
ground with such incredible force that Dominic is nearly
knocked unconscious

INT DINER NEAR SALT FLATS -- CONTINUOUS

This place just doesn’t change Even the OWNER looks the
same He’s enjoying a quiet cup of coffee when a THUNDEROUS
SCREECHING interrupts him As his restaurant quivers Per
usual he’s unflappable - even as his place rattles around
him

EXT RURAL UTAH -- CONTINUOUS

The ship stays in one piece rolling to a stop near the old
DINER

INT WELLS 3 -- CONTINUOUS

Dominic cant believe hes alive He pops his HATCH and
struggles out

EXT RURAL UTAH -- CONTINUOUS

A light RAIN falls And though this may be the future it
could very well be today This place hasnt changed at all
He walks toward the DINER

INT DINER -- MOMENTS LATER

Weve seen this place before rattling with the SONIC BOOM
years ago And guess what It hasn’t changed a bit
Strangely theres a curious CHIMP wearing an APRON behind
the COUNTER This is surreal

DOMINIC
(sotto)
NoIt cant be

And nothing

DOMINIC

Dominic turns to the doorway sees the OWNER of the place
And he looks miffed as usual

faints

Dominic is at the COUNTER puzzling over a NEWSPAPER when the
DOORS BELL announces more customers Dominic looks over and
sees -

Buck OShea who stands front and center next to a pair of
kids late teens One is an attractive FEMALE TOMBOY The
other looks like a TEST PILOT in training a young Dominic
same age Buck looks like hes on the verge of tears

BUCK
My Godwe thought you were gone
But I held out hope

At seeing how old Buck looks and staring at these strangers
its finally settling into Dominic And he moves in for an
emotional embrace

BUCK
Its great to see you

Off of everybodys incredulous looks Theres absolute
silence as Dominic realizes hes seeing his GRANDKIDS who are
young adults now Theyre not sure just yet

Buck listens in closely With his old age hes become a
real softy But James sits off to the side Hes got
something to say but is holding it in

DOMINIC
--At about 180 thousand miles per
second it looked like space was
splitting apart and I was entering
a new dimension

BUCK
A wall of light

Dominic nods

GREAT GRANDKID 1
Did you crash

DOMINIC
No I didnt But I certainly
thought I would I had to punch the
atomic engine once I re-entered the
atmosphere

BUCK
You went atomic Here

DOMINIC
Had too I was being chased down

Everybody begins talking at once overwhelming Dominic
Dominic is trying to sort this thing out as best he can but
while this is happening son James is brooding in the corner
We now realize that he and his father are roughly the same
age It looks like hes had enough of this reunion

JAMES
Alright alrightEverybody out of

They all want to hear more

JAMES
No No Clear out

They all begin to do so complaining on their way out After
a moment the room is empty - save for Buck who look at the

son Theres then a long moment between the two After all
its been a long time for James and he still cant believe
his eyes

JAMES

this may be the future but it
doesnt mean they sellem at Wal-

where the doctor is - or if hes
alive for that matter Finally you
gotta make it out without being
shot down And even if you do I
dont know if you have enough
enriched uranium left to make the

DOMINIC
We can fix the landing gear
Ill find the doc And Im not
worried about the calculations
Ill leave the science to YOU

Buck looks like he might not be up to the challenge

BUCK
What about your family Dominic
You just got here

Dominic thinks for a moment looks over to James who is
studying the WELLS 3 with JJ and Amy

DOMINIC
Ill make it right with them

BUCK

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE

All of the following stays
classified The pilot of the ship
is Dominic Coleman Hes already a
cult-figure to many and we dont
want to add to his myth

(then)
Based on our information weve
calculated that he landed somewhere
in this region of the Southwest

The FOUR CORNER AREA is displayed satellite shot of its
pancake landscape

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
I would bet the four-corner area
Its what he knows

A picture of the Wells 3 appears

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE

But our priority is the ship
(then)

Remember Dominic Coleman is a
dangerous threat And the Wells 3
must be secured Though he has been
off the radar for some time make

undermine our national security

And the WELLS 3 down now and being PAINTED by the CHILDREN
While inside the WELLS 3 Dominic is showing James how the

prediction

No way

Finally James breaks the silence

Its just that how would you feel
if your dad showed up in time

credulity

As our guys exit the elevator and step into what looks like
no hospital weve ever seen Its a modern Goliath of a
place 20000 square feet WIDE OPEN with no CEILING Its
also naturally lit and BRIGHT from the daylight pouring
through the transparent GLASS WALLS

This floor also seems to serve as the EPICENTER of the health
center complete with LONG ESCALATORS and MONORAILS running
through it

As ALLIANCE SOLDIERS are flooding the place racing through
the floor creating chaos

OUT FROM A SURGERY ROOM -- Dr Timmis and his son are pushing
James who lay covered on a HOSPITAL BED DOMINIC pushes
along dressed as a doctor complete with SURGICAL MASK

They breeze by the first wave of SOLDIERS heading towards
the GLASS ELEVATORS

AT THE RECEPTIONIST DESK - A PAIR OF SOLDIERS who are
obviously looking for Doctor Timmis stand by a NURSE who
spots him pushing the HOSPITAL BED with his son and Dominic

very dangerous is trying to contact

Dominic’s instincts tell him to run He does so taking son
James with him like a bobsled racer James pops his head up
off the bed

JAMES

DOMINIC
STAY DOWN

As he runs Dominic tears off his surgical mask and cloak
looks behind him SOLDIERS are charging and with no bed to
push - theyre gaining fast

Dominic doesnt know where to go UP AHEAD theres a WIDE
TURN that leads to the MONORAIL But just as Dominic makes
that turn -

A SOLDIER tackles him onto the rolling HOSPITAL BED rolling
recklessly toward the GLASS WALL

With all the weight and momentum on it -

CRASHES THROUGH -—

EXT HEALTH CARE CENTER -- CONTINUOUS

As Dominic SOLDIER James and the HOSPITAL BED SHATTER
THROUGH the GLASS in spectacular fashion DROPPING to the
nearby GLASS ROOF which angles downward and out

Because the building is so ANGULAR the FALL isnt that far
but theyre at a STEEP INCLINE and begin SLIDING DESPERATELY
DOWNWARDS

A scrap ensues Father versus Soldier And with son James
hooked onto the hospital bed hes being dragged towards his
death

locked in battle16 storiesblows exchangednasty
kidney shots for the general and a head-butt for dad15
storiesand dropping

A HELICOPTERJET HYBRID appears sweeping over them

What Dominic lacks in technique is made up for with heart and
sheer will to survive

But the Soldier fueled by years of military training gains
the upper hand He manages to pin Dominic as they slide and
pounds away

And theyre still slipping downward the COPTERJET HYBRID
hovers at the edge ropes dropped SOLDIERS prepared for an
airborne rescue

POV LOBBY -- CONTINUOUS
As the trio slide down the glass roof
BACK ON THE ROOF -

The Soldier draws his gun and tries to point it at Dominic
but its slapped away Dominic follows with a double
tomahawk blow to the chest forcing the soldier off him

Dominic frees himself hurls his body scrambling for the GUN
- all while reaching for his son whos being dragged by the
bed closer and closer to the edge the soldier all over him

It looks like theyre all gonna slide off the roof but
somehow Dominic manages to position himself GRABS FOR THE
GUN

Son James wrests himself from the HOSPITAL BED which quickly
rolls off the edge

SMASHING TO THE PAVEMENT BELOW

Dominic and James desperately scrape at the glass roof to
slow their momentum But with the soldier hanging all over
them its nearly impossible

Dominic raises the GUN We think hes going to plug the guy
but instead he kicks the soldier sending him on his way

before SHOOTING THE ROOF beneath them

The GUN is no ordinary piece It sends out a massive PULSE
obliterating the GLASS sending he and his son -

CRASHING THROUGH the GLASS CEILING much to the shock of the
innocents that stand below

And they plummet downwardfortuitously towards the POOL

SPLASH

DOMINIC

FROM THE HELICOPTER - A CABLE IS DROPPED and with it comes a
PAIR of BOLD POLICEMEN shimmying downward Theyre not going
to let JJ get on that ship

But James swerves lanes Now theyre going AGAINST TRAFFIC -

clipping an oncoming car and flying out of sight theyre

Where its a labyrinth of ROADS the heart of what is an
extensive underground freeway system - complete with mass
transit

Fortunately for the bad guys the remaining bikes have the

their target

While James relies on his SIREN to clear the way and his
excellent instincts at averting head-on collisions Dominic
looks petrified

You drive like your mother

JJ is making his way to the WELLS 3 But moving at this
speed every undulation in the road is like a CRATER making
a difficult task absolutely harrowing And the POLICE
swinging towards him via their cables arent helping either

But somehow James gets to the ship and Amy quickly undoes the
HITCH that holds it in place - just before the POLICEMEN drop
onto the trailer

The BACKSTOP of the TRAILER suddenly drops Released from its
hitch the WELLS 3 SLIDES OFF - onto the HIGHWAY - only feet
from the POLICE CARS that chase it rolling on its wheels by
momentum

makes a sharp RIGHT TURN

passes leaving the MOTORBIKES behind

BUT HES IN THE OPPOSITE LANES NOW - skidding out doing a

peeling off in the opposite direction Off dad’s horrified

occurs to him how much his father has gone through

Is this a flashback Weve been here before

INT TENT -- CONTINUOUS

In the eye of the hurricane husband and wife talking about
what matters most to them FAMILY

DOMINIC

potential Meg

MEHGAN
You know youre so concerned with
their potential why dont you just
enjoy their presence

DOMINIC

MEHGAN
You always say that What if you
dont come back

Dominic hugs his wife

DOMINIC
I always come back

Theres the fleeting hesitation in his eyes that tell us
something is bothering him But he covers it well hugging
his wife

INT WELLS 3 -- CONTINUOUS

With EARTH close at hand weve never seen Dominic so
determined as he pushes the throttle

EXT SPACE -- CONTINUOUS
As the Wells 3 blazes towards Earth on the outskirts of its
atmosphere

INT TRAILER -- MOMENTS LATER

Where John is getting ready pulling up his RACERS SUIT
primping Father enters just watches a moment

DOMINIC
I hope youre ready for this

The kid gives us an ear to ear grin but still he doesnt
look ready But Dad is so overwhelming He steps forward
Pulls something from his POCKET

INT WELLS 3 -- CONTINUOUS

Were racing across the continent now And Dominic is
clutching the same AMULET ST JOSEPH

John takes the small piece of jewelry studies it with
reverence before looking to his father

JOHN

INTERCUT - POV WELLS 3 -- CONTINUOUS

Approaching the great expanse that is BIG SKY country And
EXPLODING towards its SALT FLATS

INT DINER -- CONTINUOUS

Where the EXPLOSION shakes the place And the OWNER who
seems trapped in his own timeless zone just shakes his head
again

POV DOMINICWELLS 3 -- CONTINUOUS

Coming in way too hard

EXT SALT FLATS -- CONTINUOUS

And smashing into the ground the LANDING GEAR SNAPS Nose
diving into the salt And dragging for what seems like a
mile

Dominic pops his hatch Hes just a 14 mile short In fact
he can hear all the commotion in the distance

He hops out a look of defeated desperation on his face
POV DOMINIC -- CONTINUOUS

Who looks at the DINER

INT DINER -- MOMENTS LATER
As Dominic barges in The OWNER LOOKS UP

DOMINIC
I need to borrow a car

All of a sudden a miracle The old grouch of an owner simply
reaches into his pocket tosses Dominic the keys doesn’t say
a word The second Dominic leaves the guy shakes his head

DINER OWNER
Test pilots

EXT DRESSING ROOM -- CONTINUOUS

Dominic exits the trailer not as confident as he was Its
clear something is on his mind when he suddenly stops
Thinks Its as if he feels something Disregarding this
instinct he moves on
Note From here out the two Dominics will be referred to as
OLDER DOMINIC from the future and YOUNGER DOMINIC from
the past

EXT RACE GROUNDS -- CONTINUOUS

As the OLDER DOMINIC is here now zipping through the
crowd He knows exactly where to go too

EXT DRESSING ROOM -- CONTINUOUS

Stopping outside the trailer the OLDER DOMINIC looks
around enters cautiously

INT DRESSING ROOM -- CONTINUOUS

As soon as OLDER DOMINIC enters he is awestruck It’s almost
surreal In front of him is the child he lost all those years
ago He approaches slowly eyes welling up

OLDER DOMINIC
John

Son John turns smiles widely

JOHN
Yeah pa

Older Dominic is stunned Silent for the moment

JOHN
You okay

OLDER DOMINIC
YeahI want you to do something
for me
(then)
I need you to stay back

JOHN
But pa you just -

OLDER DOMINIC
(stern)
I know what I just said alright
Youre not going There’1l be other
times for you I’m sorry

Older Dominic reaches out to his son and gives him a warm
embrace the embrace he was never able to give his son
before

INT DOMINICS TRAILER -- CONTINUOUS

YOUNGER DOMINIC is all dressed and ready appraising
himself in the mirror Equipment-wise not much more than
your NASCAR racer But he looks way badder Around his neck
ST JOSEPH He holds it a moment thinks then reverentially
puts on his HELMET Its GO TIME

EXT DYNAMITE ROAD -- CONTINUOUS

As Younger Dominic moves towards his ROCKET CAR and takes his
seat in the front DRIVING

As we recall the seating arrangement is like a FIGHTER
PLANE He takes the FRONT SEAT manning the speed and
steering In the back seat the doomed co-pilot is already
sitting in the rear of the vehicle Younger Dominic looks
back
With his helmet on and strapped in the co-pilot is
unrecognizable

Everyone in the tent starts buzzing
BACK IN THE ROCKET CAR

John gives his thumbs up before beginning the ignition
sequence

AT THE CARS REAR we see the JETS churn causing the 2000
pound supersonic car to move gracefully forward

INSIDE THE COCKPIT - Pa is all business now going through
the checklist in his head like a computer

INT ROCKET CAR -- MOMENTS LATER

Were already heading towards 200mph and it looks like
Dominic is out for a Sunday spin

DOMINIC
Runnin through the first tick

just a little bit
INTERCUT - DYNAMITE ROAD

As we see the salt racer accelerate towards sound speed

INTERCUT - ROCKET CAR

As Dominic drops the throttle SHHHWEWWWWWW

Another spectacular SONIC BOOM resonates through the sky

INTERCUT —- TENT

As the CAR rockets towards its record speed Mehgan still
worried holding her son

INT ROCKET CAR -- CONTINUOUS

Were at that moment now That moment of fateful decision for
Dominic Were upwards 700 mph and Dominic wants more

Only this time Dominic pulls his hand away from the switch
This ride will end here

OLDER DOMINIC
What are you doing

Dominic can not believe his ears He looks to the back - and
sees himself

OLDER DOMINIC
Lets tip this cow and go home

BUCK (0S)
Dominic who are you talking to
INTERCUT - TENT

Where theres confusion And to top it off John is here
moving closer to his mother and brother

JOHN
He wouldn’t let me go Said to give
him this when he came back

In John’s hand the VIAL

INTERCUT —- CAR

Inexplicably the younger Dominic seems to understand A man
can not have two souls right

With this final advice the younger Dominic reaches out to
the final thrust and releases it

And just like before - the monster really gives in
752345

BUCK (0S)
You just broke your old record
Dominic

But it means nothing to him Hes braced for the inevitable
explosion

OLDER DOMINIC
You take care of that family of
ours

And so it comes Suddenly and as horrifically as we last
remember THE EXPLOSION

CROSSFADE

EXT DYNAMITE ROAD CRASH SITE -- MOMENTS LATER

Where the younger Dominic stands - almost catatonic as he
surveys the wreckage of his vehicle Moments later the
CARAVAN of MEDICS and FIREMEN approach But the first to
make it to Dominic are his WIFE and TWO BOYS

And we go supercool SLO MO -

As the patriarch moves from the wreckage towards his family
and all engage in the most emotional group embrace weve ever
seen

FADE OUT

EXT CHILDRENS HOSPITAL ARIZONA -- DAY

The stunning architecture and manicured grounds indicate to
us that this is one of the best hospitals in the land

INT HOSPITAL ROOM -- CONTINUOUS

Where a YOUNG BOY hooked up to an IV poked and prodded by
a group of concerned DOCTORS Off to the corner is a would-
be attractive WOMAN But her face is swollen with worry

This is his MOTHER HELEN

CLOSE ON BED IDENTIFICATION - Michael Stewart OUI (Of
undiagnosed illness)

Look closer at the boys hands Hes playing with a small
TOY Its a HOT WHEELS CAR - an exact replica of Dominics
ROCKET CAR complete with the phrase The Fastest Man on
Earth etched into it

INT HOSPITAL CHAPEL -- CONTINUOUS

Where a MAN is kneeling in prayer It looks like hes been up
for days too - just like his WIFE But look closer This is
SENATOR Bill Stewart - years before he ever became President
As he stares at the unitarian altar a place where all faiths
come to mourn pray and hope the Senator seems lost in the
LIGHT that reflects through the STAINED GLASS WINDOWS He
mumbles a desperate plea to his Creator just as -

Dominic enters

As he sees the senators BODY GUARDS he knows hes in the
right place and walks up the center genuflects and takes a
seat behind the senator

DOMINIC
(quietly)
Senator Stewart

The Senator turns to face this stranger Bodyguards perk up

DOMINIC
I know what youre praying for

Dominic then pulls out the ANTIDOTE from his jacket and hands
it to the future President The BODYGUARDS look like they may
make a move but the Senator signals them off Its okay

DOMINIC
(off the senators
quizzical look)
Dont ask

The Senator can not believe this It is a miracle But before
he can even address it Dominic is on his way out Suddenly
the Senator rises

PRESIDENTSENATOR
EXCUSE ME SIR BUT WHO ARE YOU

Dominic smiles

DOMINIC
Im the fastest man on Earth Mr
President

With that Dominic is out the door And the BODYGUARDS look
at one another President But before he makes the door
Dominic stops for one more thing

DOMINIC
Oh and sir You ever come across a
General Samuel Becker in your
travels
(then)
FIRE HIM

CuT TO
EXT PROVIDENCE HOSPITAL -- MOMENTS LATER

The boys are playing with their dog Speedy outside their
SUV waiting for their father while mom is sitting
patiently on the passengers side Dominic approaches

DOMINIC
Alright boys Lets go

INT COLEMAN SUV MOVING -- MOMENTS LATER

With the chaos of a big hairy dog bouncing about and the
boys playing in the back Dominic couldnt be happier And
Patsy is back on the radio singing her same number from the
opening “Crazy Dreams”

Crazy Dreams linger on as I face an empty dawn with no end
to it all can I see

Dominic reaches over to his wife and takes her hand She
wasnt expecting the warmth but appreciates it

MEHGAN
What

Nothing Just love thats all

MEHGAN
I suppose youre going to tell me
what happened some day

Dominic nods Smiles

MEHGAN
And I suppose that something has to
do with what were towing around

Another nod and smile

MEHGAN
What is it

DOMINIC
Lets just call it a family
project

MEHGAN
Does it have anything to do with
speed

DOMINIC
Actually Im thinkin about
slowing down

Fair enough And so we leave the Coleman family watching
them head down the highway And as we pull away listening
to a family at play -

EXT HIGHWAY -- CONTINUOUS

And we see the SUVs payload the remnants of this
ramshackle spaceship that broke the last physical law known

to man THE SPEED OF LIGHT

For Ive surely reached the endJust another Crazy Dream
for me

THE END
