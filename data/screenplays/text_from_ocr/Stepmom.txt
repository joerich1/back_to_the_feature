INT RACHELS BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING

A billowy white screen An alarm clock BLARES As MAIN TITLES
BEGIN the lovely sleeping face of RACHEL KELLY rolls into frame
Then out of it Alarm keeps BLASTING Back she comes pulling the
sheets OVER her head Motionless now as we hear

the DEAFENING SILENCE of the alarm shutting off A beat
Rachel SITS BOLTS UPRIGHT LEAPS out of the room From the back
we see that shes dressed only in a pair of mens boxers

She makes it halfway down the hall does a U TURN back into the
bedroom frantically YANKS a robe hanging from the door taking the
wall hook WITH her She FLINGS her robe on as she RUNS down the
hall wall hook STICKING OUT of her back BURSTING INTO

INT BENS ROOM - EARLY MORNING

RACHEL
Ben You overslept again damn it

The room looks like a 6 (but Im almost 7) year old exploded
Posters of MAGICIANS on all the walls Rachel darts about the room
mismatching the clothes she forgot to arrange the night before

RACHEL
Get Up Get Up Get Up
The LUMP under the cover doesnt move

RACHEL

No movement Rachel tugs the sleeve of a shirt hanging on a chair
and out comes a magicians bouquet of FLOWERS

She RIPS the covers off and a blow-up DINOSAUR sleeps in Bens
place

RACHEL
Ben Im not kidding around You make
yourself appear this instant

A WHITE BUNNY saunters across her toes Rachel SCREAMS -- then
gathers her wits and searches under the bed -- under the bureau --
she opens the closet doors and shoving clothes aside

RACHEL
You might think this is funny but this
is actually NOT funny

Unseen by Rachel six-year-old BEN sits perched on the highest
closet shelf knees under his chin holding his breath His eyes
gleeful as Rachel frantically closes the closet door

INT HALLWAY - EARLY MORNING

Rachel hops over the Bunny navigates through strewn toys and books
STUBBING her baby toe She limps in agony past a big picture of
the kids with their daddy and heads towards a door with a KEEP OUT
EVERYONE sign

RACHEL

ANNABELLE WAKE UP
ANNABELLES BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING

ANNABELLE 10 years old sits on the edge of her bed fuming all
of her limbs crossed She holds up a filthy purple tee shirt
ANNABELLE

Day at school today

RACHEL

INT SUBURBAN EXTREMELY WELL-STOCKED KITCHEN - EARLY MORNING

Rachel smoking a cigarette and drinking a diet coke FLINGS open

pantry doors closet doors -- looking for Ben -- attempting to put
stone hard butter on toast at the same time She glances at the
clock -- 755 Oh dear Annabelle sits at the table in a grumpy

orangey red mood Rachel hands her what was once a piece of toast

Hohos and Chips She glances at the clock again -- 800

ANNABELLE
You swore You owe me a quarter Did

you I needed my egg carton for seed
planting today

RACHEL

Rachel takes the eggs from the fridge and dumps them -- accidentally
missing the sink They SHATTER onto the floor She hands the empty
carton to Annabelle

We are late We are seriously late Which
means Mister Ben weve got to get you
dressed --

No

Ben races away but Rachel LUNGES And CATCHES him He wiggles in
her arms as she struggles to change his clothes Just as she gets
his bottoms off she drops his clothes in the pile of gooey eggs
when we hear a loud KNOCKING at the kitchen door Holding a half
naked Ben in her arms Rachel looks up at

JACKIE HARRISON An immaculately dressed intimidatingly intel-
ligent utterly beautiful woman staring at her with extreme
disapproval

ANNABELLE AND BEN
Mommy

EXT PHOTOGRAPHY STUDIO TRIBECA - MORNING

Taxi pulls up to a converted warehouse Rachel BOLTS out
SPRINTING for the door

INT PHOTOGRAPHY STUDIO - DAY

Black and white FILLS the frame Like a checkerboard We PULL
BACK and realize we are seeing a group of PENGUINS waddling against
a black and white backdrop We see a WHITE WAITRED in a BLACK
TUXEDO holding glasses on a tray A BLACK MODEL IMAN in a WHITE
DRESS glides through it all

In the center the only dash of color is Rachel -- who has just
entered and starts expertly directing the action She calls out to
her assistant COOPER Perpetually hip Perpetually young

RACHEL

enough shadow

COOPER
Youve got a fruit loop in your hair

the camera We FREEZE for a second seeing the photo Rachel just
took An Avedonesque portrait of a model being GOOSED by a penguin
COLLIDING with a maitred who SPILLS his tray and the penguins seem
to be POINTING and LAUGHING uproariously Its an inspired photo

INT SCHOOL COUNSELORS OFFICE - 230 THAT DAY

Jackie and LUKE HARRISON -- ruggedly handsome man mid-forties
charming disarming and smart as they come They sit side by side
on a couch across from RUTH FRANKLIN an Elementary School Counselor

MRS FRANKLIN
Mr and Mrs Harrison while change is
exhilarating for adults it can be
quite challenging for a child

Lukes beeper beeps He ignores it focuses on Mr Franklin

LUKE
I wont get thatIts fine Change
we were talking about change

MRS FRANKLIN
The fact that you two are remarrying
obviously has Annabelle overjoyed
(they look at her
dumb founded)
And shes very excited about your move to
Switzerland

JACKIE
She said were getting remarried

Suddenly -- a long bell rings -- Jackie STANDS UP startled

MRS FRANKLIN
Only a fire drill My concern is that
Annabelle seems apathetic towards her
work knowing shes leaving before the
end of the semester

JACKIE
Mrs Franklin were not --

LUKE
Planning on getting --

JACKIE
Remarried There is no move

MRS FRANKLIN
(trying to appear unfazed)
Really Well then my concern for --

Lukes beeper BEEPS again They talk right over Mrs

JACKIE
Are you here

LUKE
Im here

JACKIE

Because you dont really seem here

LUKE
Im here Ive got a case where theyre
this close to sequestering the jury but
have I answered the goddamn thing

JACKIE
Somethings up wi

LUKE
You think I didnt get that

She cuts a look at Mrs Franklin
JACKIE
Excuse him He never learned how

to turn the darn thing off

And reaches Does it for him

Franklin
MRS FRANKLIN
Im wondering if theres anything going
on at home that could be intensifying
Annabelles need to create this fantasy

Long pause Then suddenly they both start speaking AT ONCE

LUKE
Ive been with someone for quite some
time and didnt feel it was appropriate
for her to move in too quickly But
after a lot of thought and careful

discussion with her -- and the kids I
might add -- she moved in last month
JACKIE

Since our divorce Luke has seen a
number of different women in three
short years and without a lot of
warning for the kids hes now living
with a woman half his age --

LUKE
Rachels not half my age

JACKIE
Were not discussing your age

LUKE
Well were not discussing Rachels
age either

JACKIE
They want to be with you Luke they go
to your house to be with their father

LUKE
Jackie they come to be part of my
life Rachel is part of that life

MRS FRANKLIN
Mr Harrison I hear you talking about
your life your needs but are you
really in touch with what Annabelle
needs

JACKIE
(suddenly fierce)
This man would walk thru fire for
Annabelle gladly any day of the week

LUKE
Napalm

JACKIE
Except for last Thursday when Rachel
forgot to pick them up --

LUKE
Jackie she was five minutes late --

MRS FRANKLIN
Im wondering if Annabelle is responding
to the underlying hostility that exists
between Rachel and Mrs Harrison

LUKE

Of course shes responding to it You
think its easy for any of us You think
its easy for Jackie to watch her kids
being looked after by someone who has
half the experience she does Of course
shes going to be hostile irrational
and defensive

JACKIE
Thank you Luke

Mrs Franklin doesnt quite know what to say The bell RINGS

LUKE

Luke was in the shower this morning and
Annabelle sort of walked in without
knocking

JACKIE
Im sure that didnt upset her
Everyone in our family takes showers

RACHEL
I was in there in him

is thick with tension

JACKIE
Did you or Luke talk to her about it
afterwards

RACHEL
No I thought it might be uncomfortable
for her --

JACKIE

You mean for you A 10-year-old girl is
coping with the fact that her father is
never coming back to live with his
family She sees her father naked with
another woman for the first time
And you think its best for her if every-
one pretends it didnt happen

(turning away)
This isnt going to work out

RACHEL
Youre damn right Im gonna sick of
your imperious bullshit I never said I
was Betty Fucking Crocker If every time
life hits her in the face you want to
have a 12 hour talk every third Friday
or the month -- go ahead I have a life

JACKIE
Oh and I dont because I have a children

to ever be a mother

JACKIE

One time you say one thing then

FEMALE VOICE (0S)
The other time Was a year ago

Everything her very breath Under complete control

where
Annabelle pushes her hair over her eyes

RACHEL
Shes gonna trip over her own feet
if she doesnt get her hair out of
her eyes

Jackie casts a sidelong glance at Rachel Decides to tell

Pushing her hair over her eyes
Means shes avoiding a confrontation

Rachel looks over Really Jackie decides to share more
Rachels reaction to

If shes twirling it shes playing
something out in her mind If shes
stopped combing it she might be
depressed

As Rachel listens shes unconsciously twisting her hair

Reading
JACKIE
She was angry at herself

Jackie looks away now To the playground just beyond the
bleachers Kids rise swings clamber over a jungle gym But her
eyes are routinely automatically zeroing in on one single kid

who is climbing his way UP a tall SLIDE Crouched over as he
inches up the shiny metal surface using the side rails Rachel
follows Jackies eyes just as

Ben reaches the top and STANDS UP hands OVER his head Jackies
breath catching Ben totters once and

FALLS fast hitting the grass with a thump we can hear lying
crumpled motionless as our two women

SPRING up as one SCRAMBLING down the bleachers RUNNING toward
the playground Jackie initially in the lead but Rachel out-
sprints her CLOSING on the child as he rolls over grasping his
leg and reaching him first

Â»some instinct makes her hold back let Jackie RUSH past her to
kneel at Bens side She lifts her baby in her arms His pants
are torn his leg is bleeding His own concern

BEN

A full house of walk-ins with assorted needs none of which appear
to require George Clooney on an urgent basis Across the room an
irritated Jackie finishes the last of the paperwork at the nurses
station Exchanges a less-than-pleasantry with the less-than-
helpful duty nurse and

-heads off through the crowd DOWN a hallway TURNS a corner to
see

LUKE stands by a doorway Smiling as he gazes into a hospital
room Jackie comes to his side looks in

Ben doesnt see them His back is turned as he talks to Rachel
who sits on the side of his bed feeding him the pudding she got
from a vending machine

RACHEL
Well thats a long way off sweetie

He glances back through the doorway

therapy has left her You can hear Rachels GASP clear to Kansas

EXT ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - NIGHT

Parents streaming slowly in for a PTA night They are chatty
tired preoccupied And 95 female

INT ELEMENTARY SCHOOL COMMON ROOM - NIGHT

Folding chairs set in rows Parents taking their seats with coffee
and cookies Up front a table where a panel of speakers are
beginning to gather A faded banner says PTA -- TENAFLY DAY SCHOOL
Jackie is nibbling at a single cookie when

a figure slips into the seat beside her Rachel is juggling a
coffee and maybe nine cookies Drops one Picks it up Dusts it
off Jackie is repelled but has to smile

JACKIE
Small world

RACHEL
Lukes depo ran late I promised
Id take notes

To prove it she balances the cookies on her thighs and produces a
notebook Looks around and in a conspiratorial near-whisper

RACHEL

my Own once

RACHEL
Anyway He walks up to her on
lunch yard today And tells her
publiclythat theyre breaking up

Jackies mouth drops

JACKIE

this going out thing so one of them
can dump the other one and they can
imitate the whole passionate adult
soap opera tragedy without ever
having to actually date

JACKIE
Shes devastated

RACHEL
Doesnt begin to describe it
I mean youve got cancer this
is serious

Rachel GRIPS Jackies arm

RACHEL
She spent an hour in the girls bath-
room crying with eight of her closest
friends who are sending the message
to every boy in the grade that Brad
Kovitsky is yesterdays toast
Devours an entire cookie in one gulp

RACHEL
So heres the point I pick her up
from soccer she tells me the whole
mess and asks me what to do

carefully peeling them

Good girl

Annabelles eyes well up She covers by concentrating all the
harder

JACKIE

ANNABELLE
I call him a fartface or a pervert
or something equally lame

JACKIE
You have to ignore him

And on this Annabelle looks up

JACKIE
Hes not even there You dont
see him you dont hear him youre
just too much of a woman to bother
with little boys

ANNABELLE
This is a joke right
Jackie shakes her head Nope

JACKIE
All he wants is the attention
When he cant get to you hell try
harder for a little while Then
hell give up Itll be no fun

The kid blinks

ANNABELLE
You think Rache would do that

Takes Mom back a bit Enough for her daughter to notice
ANNABELLE
Its just shes younger Maybe
she remembers how to do this

Jackie shrugs Maybe Annabelle studies her

ANNABELLE
Thisll work huh

JACKIE
Oh yeh

trademark determination

EXT YARD - DAY
AERIAL VIEW of Jackie Annabelle Tucker and assorted neighborhood
looky-loo kids from SEVENTY FEET in the air Everyone looks like
TINY DOTS running around the lawn We realize that we are almost

at the TOP of a giant EVERGREEN TREE

We see a patch of red And now a blue stripe The wind reveals

more -- Its BEN CLIMBING to the very top of the tree The calling
of his name becoming more and more faint in the distance -- His leg
MISSES a branch -- causing a cluster of PINE CONES to FALL in front
of Jackie -- she looks up screaming --
JACKIE
BEEEENNNNNN
Jackies POV -- Ben crouched at the top of the evergreen -- as the

wind sways the tree perilously back and forth

JACKIE
Dont move

SMASH CUT TO LATER as
An enormous CRANE moves through the sky Jackie holds tightly onto

JESSICA a diminutive five-foot-tall Firewoman as they soar skyward
towards Ben A slightly condescending tone to

JESSICA
Thats quite a grip you have there
Maam Do we have an issue with

heights
Patronized the wrong gal Ina crisis

JACKIE
(looking her up and
down)
I dont care if youre a dwarf
so long as you do your job
BEN IM COMING STAY THERE
MOMMYS COMING

JESSICA
Maam my arms going numb maybe
you could loosen your grip just a
little

JACKIE
Thats absolutely out of the question
BEN IM HERE

The crane STOPS Ben has climbed to the top branches of the trees
they SWAY from side to side like a METRONOME

JESSICA
Hello Ben Your mother says youre
real good at disappearing --

Ben tries to climb a little higher -- Branches SNAP
JACKIE
Ben Mommys so glad to see you -- Now

(He keeps climbing)
Ben listen to me

BEN
No I have to get there

JACKIE
Where Ben

BEN
Before you

JACKIE

Ben where do you have to get to

BEN
Heaven I have to tell him hes made
a mistake He should take Grammy
Martha first Or Grandpa Norman

Jackies heart breaks unable to speak

JACKIE
Ben God doesnt like visitors

BEN
How do you know

JACKIE
Ask her shes a heroic Fireperson
She does this twenty times a day

BEN
Oh

Jessica begins to crawl out to him on the limb

JESSICA
Oh yeh Its in our official manual
JACKIE
Thats right Ben Thats why Firemen
have giant ladders and climb up
and down poles Theyre like
messengers carrier pigeons
between heaven and earth

BEN
Thats good cause we need to hurry
My mom doesnt have very much time
left

JESSICA
Then you know what we should do
We should go to the Fire Station
together and ring the firebell to
get Gods attention

BEN
Cause its an emergency

Ben opens his arms teeters and Jessica HAS him She reaches him
out and

-HANDS him to Jackie alone in the cherry-picker Jackie GRASPS
Ben pulling him FIERCELY to her arms in a death grip

From down below the kids CHEER The worst is over
HOLD on Jackie clutching her baby for dear life Knowing it isnt
INT BENS BEDROOM - NIGHT

Jackie stands in the doorway watching her son -- her baby boy --
sleeping She looks drawn but even if her body would let her
sleep she couldnt

JACKIE
(a whisper)
GodI will do anythingI will
go through any amount of pain you
give me If youll just let me
see them grow up

A slow ragged breath

JACKIE
Is that asking so damn much

She leaves the room soundlessly Ben stirs
ANNABELLES BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

Annabelle sleeps soundly in the glow of a night light Jackie
appears leaning down to rouse her gently
JACKIE
Annabellewake up honey

ANNABELLE
(sleepy)
Mom Whats wrong

JACKIE

Jackie sits on the edge of the bed stroking Annabelles head

JACKIE
I got Ginny Weintraub to come stay
with Ben

Annabelles puzzled look Why would you do that

JACKIE
Howd you like to go someplace
special with me Right now

EXT NORTH VALE STABLES - NIGHT

The light of the full moon illuminates the night and we see Jackie
and Annabelle sitting on a horse Annabelle in front Jackie with
a strong hold on her Both have their nightgowns tucked into their
jeans coats over them

JACKIE
Hold tight sweetheart

She KICKS the horse forward and they HEAD OFF toward the rolling
hills in the distance Jackie and Annabelle ride faster and faster
along the trail Jackie has one arm firmly around Annabelles
waist and controls the horse with the other Jackie closes her
eyes for a moment allowing the wind to wash over her The smells
and sounds of the night seem to free her give her strength
Annabelle relaxes against her mother and giggles with delight
Jackie soon joins her and the sounds of their laughter break the
silence of the night

They come to a stop at the crest of a small hill and we now see the
tears on Jackies face Annabelle cant see and stares out at the
moonlit valley before them

JACKIE
Im never never going to forget this

Annabelle snuggles back Happy

ANNABELLE
Never say never

Jackie kisses the top of her babys head

JACKIE
Youre old enough to learn the
loophole You can say never
never If you mean it enough
To say it twice

Annabelle yawns So content in her mothers arms

ANNABELLE
Ill remember Always always

So Jackie grips a little tighter Breathes a single word just
loud enough to hear

JACKIE

ANNABELLE

EXT PARK - DAY

LONG ANGLEfive swings in use In four the kids are pushed by
moms or nannies In the fifth Ben is pushed by Annabelle Guess
whos going the highest PULL BACK to

two women on a bench Under a starkly bare tree Jackie is
drinking in the air the cold the day Rachel watching that

RACHEL
Serene Youre getting the hang
of it

Jackie doesnt answer for a beat Almost as if she hasnt heard

JACKIE
Serene means you accept

Shakes her head

JACKIE
Part of me hasnt quit yet And
the other part is still pretty
outraged
(calmly)
When its not terrified

Watching the world of moms and kids Who are not terrified

JACKIE
Im thinking Do I know you well
enough to really chew you out

RACHEL
No

Jackie turns to her Diamond laser glare
JACKIE

Have you lost your mind You fought
years for that job And you quit

Oh That

RACHEL
Its just not the right time t

JACKIE
Do what youve worked your whole
life to do

RACHEL
It was just a job therell be plenty
of others

JACKIE
You mean after Im dead

Do you

RACHEL
Hey you havent quit on you Im
sure as hell not gonna I just
mean Im juggling a lot right n

JACKIE
Juggle it Move the darkroom into
your house Youve got that room
downstairs with the treadmill Luke
never uses anyway Dont lose your
confidence Dont lose your edge

RACHEL
Its the same choice you made

JACKIE
Yes I made the choice that was
right for me And I dont regret
it But even for me there were
days when I felt so lost so invis-
ible And then Id hate myself for
the kids not being enough
Reading Rachels face

JACKIE
(softer)
I know you huh The car pools
he measles the PTA Its not
gonna be enough for you in the long
run You have to think long term

RACHEL
I just want to spend time with
them when Im not rushing or on
the phone or tired or

JACKIE
Thats motherhood Thats the
job with or without a career
Im telling you the biggest gift
you can give them is your happiness
They need you to be happy

Can you hear me

JACKIE
Cause if youre not the easiest
person to blame is the guy sleeping
next to you And youll push him
away and then hate him even more
when he goes until finally you have
no choice but to leave And that
cant happen

Rachels turn to wonder She starts to say something

better of it Asks instead

RACHEL
Thats the bottom line isnt it
I cant make a mistake Because
itll screw your kids

Glances over

RACHEL
My advice to you Dont die

JACKIE
Feeling the pressure

Rachels eyes move across Jackies face Then
distant swings

RACHEL
Last time I pushed him He said
âHigher Rache It makes my penis
sting

out to Ben

thinks

on the
Thin smile Now its Jackie watching Rachels profile

RACHEL
Im gonna buy him that white dove
for Christmas If I dont youll
get him a fucking eagle

Jackie keeps watching her And in a quiet voice

JACKIE
Ben was born in two hours went
right to my breast and camped
there for three days Always with
thismischievous look

Watches Rachel nodding absorbing

JACKIE
Somehow his blanket always looked
like a cape even the nurse said
that He loves to hear that story
over and over How he was born a
magician

RACHEL
(softly never turning)
And her

JACKIE
Took 28 hours She just wasnt
sure about entering this world

Watches the feeling well in Rachels eyes

JACKIE
The doctor wanted to go in and get
her but I knew shed come in her
own time

Rachel nods It fits
JACKIE
Thats who she is Dont let
anybody rush her

Silence A murmur

RACHEL
Ill keep that in mind

Rachel settles back Her eyes now locked away somewhere private
JACKIE

(quietly)
What
Rache smiles That Jackie sensed something

RACHEL
Its not about the kids

Looks over Decides whether to ask

RACHEL
That thing you said before Pushing
the guy sleeping next to you away
Because of what you gave up for
motherhood

JACKIE
Is that what he told you

RACHEL
He wont discuss it Just calls it
history

A trace of edge to Jackies smile But no real anger

JACKIE
Well he got that part right

Looking Looking

RACHEL
So whats the part he got wrong

An urgency in that

RACHEL
I got all day

EXT COURTHOUSE STEPS - TWILIGHT

Luke and his bulky briefcase coming down the stone steps two at a
time until

-he sees her In her winter coat Smoking as if it could keep
her warm And despite her tension he grins heads over

LUKE

RACHEL
Hold your applause Were not
having fun here

And from her face She means every word

LUKE
(concerned)
Is Jack okay
Great Just what she wants to hear

RACHEL
Oh yeh she was cracking me up
Dishing details of her sordid
little divorce

Ah A beat To assess the damage

LUKE
And you freaked A little

Hey

RACHEL
Just like to make sure That your
past And my future Are real
different

LUKE
(quietly)
Well they will be

RACHEL
(hard and low)
Imagine my relief So whats for

He sighs Jesus

LUKE
Why in the world would she t

RACHEL
You took a fishing trip with the boys
Liked it so much you took another

LUKE
I needed some time away

RACHEL
-while she watched the kids Then
you booked this flat in Paris for your
familys summer But she said

LUKE
(weary)

the kids have camp Their friends
are here Over there Ill just be
shopping in a language I dont even
know My life and the kids lives
arent here to service your mid-life
crisis Did it go like that

It did People are passing them They do not notice

LUKE
She called it a fight The fight

RACHEL
What do you call it You told her
you had doubts

He looks around People are moving on Toward their drinks
dinners their lives

LUKE
Can we go sit somewhere

RACHEL
Let me put it this way Hell no

And takes out her cigarettes Her fingers fumble slightly
isnt the cold

LUKE
I told her I loved her

RACHEL
By way of saying you were unhappy

LUKE
Restless
RACHEL
Excuse me Things are so confusing

for me Jack Our life feels too
comfortable too safe too predict-
able Its a partnership its
juggling schedules When I think of
playing that out every day for the
rest of my life

Dead at his eyes And he nods Once

LUKE
(softly)
I dont know if I can make it
Thats what I said But I didnt
leave

RACHEL
No she threw you out What a
difficult woman

Pulls out her box of matches

RACHEL
So now I get to wait

A single match

RACHEL
For the first sign The first

their

It
fishing trip
STRIKES it Shields it from the wind

RACHEL
What do you figure Luke When
am I too old to be exciting When
your daughter brings home her college
roommate

Lights her cigarette As he watches

LUKE
(softly)
Thats a pretty ugly thing you
just said

RACHEL
No heres ugly I love you babe
Its just our life together Im not
so sure about

Big draw Never wavering from his eyes

RACHEL
But keep dancing and if youre
lucky I might just never leave
who knows

LUKE
Thats not us

RACHEL
Because youve changed so much

He puts his hands on her gently But she flinches So the
come away

LUKE
You want me to show you the future
Well I cant darlin

I cant She searches the lovelight in his eyes As if she
weigh it

LUKE
We make our lives one step at a
time We do the best we can The
truth about the future A promise
Is only a hope

RACHEL
How about the promises we make to
our kids About their future Do
we shrug those off just that easily

That slows him down

hands

could
RACHEL
Maybe Annabelle deserves to find
out who really broke up her family
While her mom is still around
Stops him Cold
RACHEL
(quiet)
Hey Just a thought
Flips her cigarette to the gutter Shrugs

RACHEL
You got one less for dinner

Takes a step back Only one But it registers

LUKE
Where you goin

RACHEL
Im gonna get me a drink

Nods to herself

RACHEL
And Im gonna drink it alone

And she walks off Slow
EXT CAR POOL LINE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - DAY

Ben alone in the back seat Reading his beloved Garfield book
Shift ANGLE to see

the women standing by the car Rachel looks a little anxious

RACHEL
You really didnt have to come
you know Id have brought them
straight t

JACKIE
(staring at something)
Who in the world is he

See now across the way A gorgeous BOY dressed cool stands
holding an expensive bike And chatting happily with Annabelle
In the distance other kids pretend they arent watching

RACHEL
Looks nice enough to m

JACKIE
He looks familiar Did he doa
Calvin Klein ad

Across the way the boy leans kisses Annabelle sweetly on the
cheek Waves to her Peddles off In distance kids are dying
Annabelle pretends not to know that Just walks casually toward
us but as she approaches she cant help breaking into a RUN
straight

into RACHELS ARMS

ANNABELLE
(breathless)
It workeditworkeditworked Omigod
you cant believe the look on his
face

SQUEEZING Rachel tight enough to crush her bones And although
Rachel hugs back although she kisses Annabelles hair

Her eyes are locked to Jackies
Houston We have a problem
EXT JACKIES YARD - DAY

Rachel alone by the weathered redwood swing and slide set She

is pacing in a circle looking like a kid waiting to see the
principal Sucking her cigarette like smoke was oxygen She picks
a bottle of beer off the grass Twists the top Settles awkwardly
on the seat of the taller swing

HEAR the screen door open Bang shut Rachel takes a sip Before
she looks up

JACKIE
(low calm)
Now were going to have a fight
you and I

RACHEL
(barely audible)
Are we

JACKIE
And Im going to win

RACHEL
(straight to her eyes)
Dont be too sure

No anger in Jackie at this moment The ferocity of that mother
lion The strongest face well ever see

JACKIE
Now âlimp dick I know What
Is snowballing
RACHEL
It doesnt matter I didnt tell h

JACKIE
Because therell be oh 20 or
30 mothers phoning me in the
next hour or so And theyll b

RACHEL
Give em my number

Jackie on the prowl around this swing Stalking her prey

JACKIE
Actually Theyll want Annabelles
mother

RACHEL

Is that what youre worried about
Looking bad at the PTA

JACKIE
You are defending what you did

RACHEL
Right down to the ground Lets
get to it
Not quite what Jackie expected

JACKIE
You put filth in my childs mouth

RACHEL

JACKIE
You had her lie about that
that fancy-boy model

RACHEL
Worked Like a charm

Jackie cannot even believe this
RACHEL
She was beaten and bloodied and
it was going to go on uni
JACKIE
So you became the hero And I
became the schmuck

Straightening her spine

JACKIE
You taught my child that I am some

limp dick loser Who didnt care
about her pain

RACHEL
Thats not wh

JACKIE
You think I didnt have some dirty
words for that little putz You think
I couldnt figure out some low blows

RACHEL
You werent passing âem out

JACKIE
Well maybe your version of growing
up is Just win baby

Stalking Closer Fierce

JACKIE
Mine Is a little different

Right there At the swing In her face

The one

Silence

JACKIE
See in that crisis I saw an
opportunity For some real growth

RACHEL
Oh please

JACKIE
Shut the fuck up I didnt go
behind your back

scored Rachel sips her beer

JACKIE
Doing the right thing Knowing who
you are inside Not caving to peer
pressure or lowering yourself to that
level steering your own course

RACHEL
She wasnt steering her own course
she was steering yours

JACKIE
Well thats what parenting is about
little girl They are pleading to
know how they are supposed to do it
And you sure as hell showed her

JACKIE
And there will come another moment
When the stakes are really there
And she will look back on this And
remember how good it felt How easy
it was

RACHEL
And shell fight back again God help
me what have I done

Jackies voice drops The softness makes it somehow more
menacing

JACKIE
Youve turned her into you And
I may not get another chance To
turn her back

RACHEL
(suddenly fierce)
Thats what it is And thats all
it is

The hand with its cigarette STABS out

RACHEL
You wont get the chance

Jackie back on her heels Thinking A mile a minute

JACKIE
Youve got a point there fora
change Oh yes you do

HER finger stabbing out

JACKIE
You didnt get morning sickness for
seven months you didnt breast feed
till your nipples fell off you didnt
spend every minute of every day
thinking and planning and knowing that
your decisions were shaping the people
they were going to be

And now Rachel Has nothing to say

JACKIE
You are gonna be taking Bens training
wheels off You are the one my little
girl will confess her first love to
You will see them married you will
play with their babies you fucking
BITCH I hate your GUTS

The blast washes over Rachel And in the silence
RACHEL
Now youre talking sense

She looks down at her beer

RACHEL
All year long Ive been watching how
you do this The worries the sacri-
fices the signals you give them

Thinks Really thinks Wants so much to say this right

RACHEL
And I admire you More than youll
ever believe And yetthis
thinghas been growing Inside me

Looks up Straight to her eyes

RACHEL
For better or worse Im not you

And so she stands up The swing shimmies in her wake

RACHEL
I cant live my life channeling the
One True Mom after youre gone I
cant do it I cant do it I cant
Do it

Sets the beer down Stabs out her smoke

RACHEL
We have to deal with that

And walks off slowly Across the yard

INT INDOOR RIDING RING - TWILIGHT

Huge indoor space Wood-sided walls dirt floor High corrugated
metal roof with birds flying roosting in rafters A little GIRL
under the keen eye of her TRAINER puts her mount through its
paces In the cold air steam rises from the horses body Its
late no one else around TRACK now

down a walkway Toward the stables A barn cat is crouched
stalking prey We hear a soft voice speaking One we know

LUKE (0S)
It was like telling her

See him now Standing awkwardly against the side of a stall

LUKE
Â»that I didnt love her anymore

See the horse still steaming Standing patiently
LUKE
if I could be sure Id always
stay

Circling the horse now we see Annabelles back She is slowly
brushing out the sweat mark Where the saddle used to be Her
movements are stiff mechanical The soft voice continues

LUKE (0S)
She said This thing you calla
partnership The schedules the
chores all the things we have to
work out

Our ANGLE CIRCLING to see at last Annabelles face

LUKE (0S)
(softer)
for the kids

The tears that stand in her eyes The set line of her small mouth

LUKE (0S)
thats the life I dreamed of
And its all I ever wanted it to be

She swallows Because she will not cry

LUKE (0S)
Thats the kind of person your mom is
Shes the best

Annabelle says nothing She drops to her knees Begins to clean
out one of her horses hooves with a metal pick The only sound

against the stillness
And her father watches His heart pounding

LUKE
I complained a lot baby We couldnt
travel wed lost our privacy our
chance to do things on the spur of the
moment To live forourselves The
way wed started out

He goes to her The sound of his feet on the straw

LUKE
And she said Sounds like youd be
happier If the kids werent around

Crouches down Very close to his child

LUKE
I said I love them more than
anything But sometimes I do
miss what Ive lost
Annabelle stops working Turns her faces away
LUKE
She said she could never feel that
way not for one single second

So he leans closer

LUKE
She didnt want to be with someone
Who could

Silence Hes staring at the back of her head

LUKE
You know this horse smells
really bad

ANNABELLE

Theres worse things
At least she can talk If only just above a whisper

LUKE
Do you know why I never told
you all this before

A beat She doesnt look at him

ANNABELLE
Sure You wanted me to blame her
Instead of you

Waiting to hear
LUKE

(very softly)
Thats right

She hears honesty And heartbreak It makes her turn

ANNABELLE
How come youre telling me now

He gets lost Looking in those eyes

LUKE
I dont want to be wrong anymore

I dont
LUKE

I want to say Im sorry because I am
And let you hate me If you have to
She swallows hard Her eyes moving over his face

LUKE
See that feeling Where you feel
two different things at once
Thats a grown-up thing Its
not a lot of fun

She shakes her head very slightly And her eyes water

LUKE
Know why your mom never told you

She doesnt

LUKE
She knew that you and her were
sosolid Nothing could rock that
But she didnt want to risk

The hardest thing Hes ever had to say

LUKE
Â»your hating me

ANNABELLE
Cos she loves you

LUKE
Cos she loves you She wanted you
to have a daddy to love Even if
he didntcompletelydeserve it

Now the tears in his eyes And shes watching that

LUKE
You know how much love that is
That she has for you

Do you

LUKE
Theres going to come a moment
When shell really need you to
give that back And youre just
the girl that can do it

The way he says this Makes her ask

ANNABELLE
Now do I know when

He reaches First time Strokes her hair

LUKE
That moment will come And your
heart is going to whisper âhere
it is
Winds his fingers Around her hand

LUKE
And youll come through

She stares in his eyes And dead straight

ANNABELLE
If I miss it daddy You clue
me in

Okay he nods Thats a plan
INT BAR - NIGHT

The dimly chic bar With its soft upscale buzz Where Jackie
told Luke she had cancer Tonight she waits alone Watching the
entrance Nursing her drink And then

-Rachel comes into the place Spots Jackie across the room
Weaves her way through the tables

And she is there Slipping into her seat Not knowing what to
say

JACKIE
Thanks for coming out

RACHEL
Neutral ground Whats up

Jackie stares evenly Her chin rests across the back of her
knuckles She looks tired but okay Fueled by adrenaline

JACKIE
Luke called He says youre
checking out Of the Heartbreak
Hotel

The waitress appears Rachel too locked into the moment to notice
So

JACKIE
She likes a Stolie no ice

RACHEL
(softly)
Double

As the woman leaves

JACKIE
Whats this about Because
we fought
RACHEL
Dont flatter yourself
(beat)
I always liked that line

Signs

RACHEL
I love Luke I love the children
But there is more to life than
even love

JACKIE
No there isnt

RACHEL
And I have looked down the road
At what my life will be And I
cant handle it

Jackie unblinking Focused strong

JACKIE
What do you see Down that road

No answer Then

RACHEL
I never wanted to be a mom Then
sharing it with you was one thing
Carrying it alone the rest of my
life

JACKIE
Is scary But you want it Gimme
some truth here

The Stolie arrives They wait a beat The waitress disappears

RACHEL
Well its the Jack Kennedy Syndrome
huh You die young you always look
golden Perfect The memory kind of
burnishes the image and

JACKIE
Come on a wuss like me The stiff
who wouldnt help her own daughter
fight back

RACHEL
Maybe I was wrong on that one

That sits there In its sincerity

JACKIE
Well maybe you werent
And so does that Tears are forming in Rachels eyes Here
this public place

RACHEL
Look when I said I couldnt channel
you That didnt mean I wouldnt give
my right arm to do just that

Shakes her head

RACHEL
Maybe I dont want to be looking over
my shoulder Every day for twenty
years Knowing someone else would
have done it right The way I cant

Jackie waits Thinks

JACKIE
Trade you a smoke For a secret

in

The way she said that Something weighty behind it So Rachel

reaches into her purse

JACKIE
You know I lost Ben awhile back
In a supermarket

Rachels hand freezes In mid-course

RACHEL
Youre lying

JACKIE
I lost him I was panicked

RACHEL
You are lying you never lost that
kid for 4 seconds you could find him
from a coma there is no WAY

JACKIE
(smiles)
I was running around like a chicken
with my head chopped off Doing my
imitation of you

Rachel still not buying

RACHEL
Ben never mentioned it

JACKIE
He only remembers I found him My
point is telling you this story would
have been the kindest most helpful

thing I could ever have done for you
The smile fades

JACKIE
Why didnt I

RACHEL
Uh You hate my guts

Passing the cigarettes over

JACKIE
We were competing Even then

Yes we were

JACKIE
Instead of being partners Watch-
ing each others back Seeing things
were covered

Pulls out a smoke Offers the pack

JACKIE
Youre not scared youll think you
dont measure up Youre scared
theyll think it Thats the JFK
thing yeh

Rachel takes one Eye contact holding

RACHEL
With good reason They fucking
worship you as it is

JACKIE
What do I have that you dont

RACHEL
Everything Yourethe Earth
Mother incarnate

JACKIE
Youre the hip and fresh

RACHEL
You ride with Annabelle

JACKIE
Youll learn

RACHEL
You know every story every wound
every memory their whole lifes
happiness has been wrapped up in
you every moment
JACKIE
I have their past

STRIKES the match

JACKIE
You Have their future

Rachel stunned By the simplicity of it all Slowly she leans
accept Jackies flame

JACKIE
Dont you get it You look down the
road to her wedding Youre in the
room alone with her fitting her veil
fluffing her dress Telling her no
woman was ever that beautiful

Tears now Standing in two pairs of eyes

JACKIE
And your fear is Shell be
thinking I wish Mom were here

Jackie lights her own

JACKIE
And mine is She wont

Her hand trembles as she takes a drag

JACKIE
Now thats enough fear for either
one of us to kill the other And
no jury in the world would convict

Jackie raises her glass
JACKIE
Were guilty girl Of being human
And we cant forgive ourselves

Holds it forward In a toast

JACKIE
But I forgive you

And slowly Rachel lifts her own glass CLICKS it with Jackies

RACHEL
Dont rush me Im deciding

SLOW DISSOLVE TO

INT JACKIES LIVING ROOM - CHRISTMAS MORNING

Ben standing at a wrapped bird cage where a dove is cooing inside
Annabelle is setting out the cocoa with a uniformed NURSE

Rachel enters Kisses Annabelles head

RACHEL

Goes down the hall every emotion in the world is playing across
her face Into

INT JACKIES BEDROOM

Jackie lies on her death bed She is beautiful and near the end
Despite the IV tube the monitor shes gotten to serenity after
all As close as any of us will ever get

RACHEL
Hey gorgeous Time for the
presents

Jackie licks her lips Pretty dry Rachel takes a cotton lemon
swab from the nightstand Tenderly cleans Jackies mouth

RACHEL
Now Edna says you short-changed your
last meds You can do presents and be
comfortable at the same time yknow

JACKIE
(clears her throat)
Just want to be a little sharper
For a few minutes

A few minutes

JACKIE
Some things to say To the kids

Smiles
JACKIE

Then bring in the presents Well

Rachel cant really bear this

RACHEL
You know theres nothing you
have to say Because they know
your heart You dont have t

JACKIE
Just sit me up Nice and tall
Bring Benjamin first

Staring at each other Then Rachel reaches her arms around
Jackie and as gently as she can manage lifts her to a full
sitting position

JACKIE
Scrapbook

Rachel brings the big book Lays it on the bed And goes

Jackie begins to turn the pages Her life with these children
passing before her eyes No tears No smile Just full
attention Fingertips touch the one she was looking for as

The door OPENS Ben hesitant enters alone His mothers face is
fine and strong and smiling

JACKIE
Find the bird cage

BEN
(standing there)
Rache says its from you

JACKIE

Well dont make him disappear
before I see him

Ben nods Okay I wont She glances to the scrapbook

JACKIE
Oh look at this

And forgetting his uneasiness he runs over climbs ONTO the bed
Jackie doesnt wince doesnt even blink Nothing for his memory
bank but smiles He looks at the photo

-Jackie holding a spunky newborn
JACKIE
Thats you and me Our first photo
as a couple
He nods Really staring at it
BEN
Did you know I was good-looking
right away
She reaches to hold his face in her hand Stares in his eyes
JACKIE
This good-looking Was beyond

my imagination

She leans Kisses his lips lightly How many more times will she
get to do this

JACKIE
(a murmur)
So what do you think were gonna
talk about

BEN
(straight back)
You dying

She nods Her smile is right there

JACKIE
The secret of it That only
magicians Can ever understand

His eyes brighten The sadness pushed aside

JACKIE
See when we die Our body goes
away Our body But wewe are
not our body are we

He doesnt know Maybe he thought we were

JACKIE
If a soldier loses his legs in a
war Is he the same guy Sure
he is

BEN
But you can still see him

JACKIE
Half Of him

This is so fucking hard But her eyes stay dry

JACKIE
Dying Is where the whole body
goes away So you cant see any
of it But

Rests her hand tenderly On his hair

JACKIE
What do magicians know

Leans forward Heres the secret
JACKIE
Just because you cant see it

Doesnt Mean Its gone

Does it And Ben smiles He is inside the secret
JACKIE
The world Thinks Im gone But
only the magician Knows better

BEN
So where are you

She was waiting for this For a long time She wraps her hand

around his fist And puts their hands against his heart

JACKIE
(a whisper)
Right here Right here Inside
the magician Shhhh

BEN
Can I talk to you When youre
there

JACKIE

Always Always And you wont
hear a voice But in here Youll
know What Im saying

Yes you will

BEN

JACKIE
No it isnt Because it isnt
everything And we want every-
thing dont we

He nods They do

JACKIE
But God does let us keep the one
best thing we have together The
one best thing weve always had
Know what it is

He doesnt But he wants to

JACKIE
I love you And you love me

Comes closer Nose to nose

JACKIE
Its worth a lot Will you keep it

He answers With a kiss

INT LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Luke and Annabelle are doing a hugely complex jigsaw puzzle

Ben
runs in falls on his knees by the puzzle Without looking at
Annabelle he tells her

BEN
Your turn It wasnt bad

Annabelle looks straight to her dad There is a moment a silence
that no one else could ever understand She leans to him and
whispers

ANNABELLE
Here it is

His eyes water He takes her in his arms Whispers close to her
ear only the words

LUKE
Here it is

She smiles at hi Fear gone filled with resolve Gives hima
kiss Rises to

follow Rachel down the hall Rache wraps an arm around her big
girl No words except a murmured

RACHEL
You can do this

Voice cracking Shes not as good at it as this girls mother

RACHEL
You can do anything

At the door Open it and

INT JACKIES BEDROOM

-Annabelle enters alone The door closes behind her Her eyes
lock with her mothers No words Annabelles eyes filled with
tears and Jackies arms

REACH out and Annabelle RUNS to them

They hold each other For a forever moment

ANNABELLE
I dont want to say goodbye

JACKIE
Dont Take me with you

And Annabelle looks up Tears on her face

JACKIE
Thank God I got to see you
Grown up
ANNABELLE

JACKIE
(very softly)
Let me be the judge of that

And Annabelle climbs onto the bed Their hands never stop touching
each other Saying I love you

JACKIE
Theres an amazing thing when a
woman has a daughter One day you
look up and you seea sister
Someone You can say Anything to

Anything

JACKIE
I wrote a whole lot of letters To
each of you And the envelope says
when to open it Like which
birthday Orwhen you get your
drivers permit First time you see
Rome Things like that

Things like that Annabelle is beginning to lose it now So
Jackie says only

JACKIE
Keep Bens for awhile okay Until
hes old enough to not open them all
at once

ANNABELLE
Until hes old enough to read

Tears on Annabelles face Her mom wonders

JACKIE
Are you afraid for me Where

ANNABELLE
Yes

JACKIE
Dont be Im going Where we
all go Now how can that be bad

ANNABELLE
Ill miss you so much

JACKIE

She nods yes it is
JACKIE

two things at once Okay

She brushes at her babys tears Then tastes her wet fingertips
Mmmn surprisingly good Annabelle sort of smiles

JACKIE
You can miss me And Take me
with you

Hold the childs face In her hands
JACKIE
When youre in trouble Have me

Said with such absolute assurance

JACKIE
Thats how we go on you know
Forever Because someone takes
us along
Annabelle swallows hard

JACKIE
On your wedding night When your
babies are born I want to be
there Will you take me
A straight question It needs an answer

ANNABELLE
Always always Always

A sigh A shared smile

JACKIE
You made my life wonderful

JACKIE

Hold On Annabelle
INT JACKIES BEDROOM - LATER THAT MORNING

The presents are here now they fill up the room spill over the
bed where both children sprawl

-Ben RIPPING the shit out of wrappings like a wolverine
Annabelle carefully saving her gift paper as if she were going to
hang it in the Louvre She holds a tank top up to her chest for
her Moms approval Jackies not sure Rachel handing up more
boxes Luke in charge of bagging trash

Bens white dove flying free around the room zipping and diving
No one cares Its Christmas

HOLD Hold And CROSSFADE TO
EXT CHAPEL - NIGHT

Family and friends are leaving the wake exiting the softly-lit
chapel into a snowy night They are saying goodbyes kissing one
another going to their cars And saying her last goodbye

-Rachel turns to Luke Whispers close to his ear He looks at
her for a beat then leads Annabelle and Ben toward the car as

Rachel goes back into the chapel Alone
INT FUNERAL PARLOR

The room is nearly dark One soft spot plays on a simple CASKET
No canned organ music no sound at all As Rachel enters

She goes to the casket Stares down at it for a beat And just
above a whisper

RACHEL
See I told you Id do this

Only

RACHEL
Only Now I dont know what to say

Her hand reaches out A finger absently traces the edge of the
wood It seems a gesture of unconscious affection

RACHEL
Youd have written it down so you
wouldnt blow it

A slight smile Heres where the love shows

RACHEL
Maybe we should change places

Nods slightly Maybe we should She takes a step back now to a
waiting chair

Sits Her hands folded in her lap Thinks
RACHEL

Well We were less than friends I
guess And more
More

RACHEL
We were nevergirlfriends we
never dished That wasnt What

we had
No apology there Its just the truth

RACHEL
We had some battles man they
wereworld class huh
(beat)
And I dont regret a one of them

Sad little shrug

RACHEL
I miss them

Thinking Of how much more shell miss

RACHEL
Weve got our secrets we have
And Ill keep em if you will

Crosses her arms Lost in the moment

RACHEL
But I wish we had one more night
In that little bar remember
Remember that toast Sure you do

Her voice wavers But the eyes are dry

RACHEL
Know what I forgive me too
See Youre the magician

A murmur

RACHEL
Dont worry partner Ive got
your back Were covered

Its what she came to say CROSSFADE TO
INT BALLROOM - NIGHT

Lights and music and laughter Theyre in black tie tonight Its
a wedding party Up on the stage at the head table some guy is
finishing a toast and as everyone ROARS and CLAPS

BEST MAN
SO TO THE BRIDE Thank GOD
shes more than he deserves
Everybody shouts THE BRIDE Everybody drinks champagne

And the bride stands up In her white gown In her hand an
envelope She goes to the mike and waits for the raucous cheers
the calls of SPEECH to die down

Leans to the mike Flushed and happy And oddly nervous

RACHEL
Now I know the tradition so
this isnt a toast At least
not for me

RACHEL
The guest list is 114 But we
all know theres one more here
tonight Because

Looks down the table at her children Dressed to kill Enjoying
the party

RACHEL
my two sidekicks there always
bring her along Wherever they go

Right Right

RACHEL
So Jackie and I were sitting
around On New Years Eve And
she said Youre not gonna talk
at my funeral are you

And now It is quiet indeed

RACHEL
And I said Ive never been to
a funeral Im not sure Ill know
how to act

Her sweet smile Keeps the mood right

RACHEL
but Ill probly sneak into
where you are Just before its
over

Nods to herself Fights back the feeling of that moment

RACHEL
say something Just to you
Get the last word in when you
cant talk back

There is laughter in this room Gentle loving
RACHEL
So she says No way

Holds up the envelope Holds it tight

RACHEL
She wrote this She sealed it
up I didnt see it She made
me promise to read it At the
wedding

And slowly Luke begins to CLAP And others join And when it
stops

RACHEL
I told her shed better make it
dirty or make it funny Because
no wayon my wedding

No way in hell

RACHEL
-could she make me cry

APPLAUSE They are loving it

RACHEL
She says âIts a dealâ

The band plays an impromptu FLOURISH Rachel begins to carefully
tear open the envelope

RACHEL
Now if its too raunchy we may
have to excuse the kids

SHOUTS from everyone ESPECIALLY the children
She has it open She looks at it
And everything Stops

The world watches her sway watches her eyes fill as she stares at
the small card in her hand She cant believe this

RACHEL
(mouths to herself)
You promised

The tears are welling Everyone SCREAMS for her to read it She
leans to the mike shaking her head

RACHEL
Itsno big thing really
its justfive words its

The place goes happily UP FOR GRABS A joyful RIOT of demand
Tears STREAMING now Rachel fumbles to pull up her white beaded
bag As she puts the card inside we alone can read the words

MY BABIES ARE SO LUCKY
HOLD on this And

FADE TO BLACK ROLL END CREDITS
