GENERAL NOTES

1 The story will be played for realistic comedy -
which means the essentially truthful moods and attitudes
will be portrayed accurately with an occasional bizarre
or super-realistic crescendo The acting will never be
so-called comedy acting

2 The sets and technical details will be done realistic-
ally and carefully We will strive for the maximum
atmosphere and sense of visual reality from the sets and
locations
3 The Flying sequences will especially be presented
in as vivid a manner as possible Exciting backgrounds
and special effects will be obtained

MACRO - GALAXY - METEOR PICTURE

la MOVING SHOT - THROUGH BLACK STARRY PERPETUAL
NIGHT OF THE UNIVERSE

The motion is straight ahead passing at varying distances

are stars planets asteroids moons aerolites and meteors
At great distances we see fantastic whirls of light indicating
a vast nebula or we see the incredible dazzling billion-star
clusters of another galaxy

MUSIC - WEIRD EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL ELECTRONIC SOUNDS

NARRATOR
The bizarre and often amusing pages
which make up this odd story were dis-
covered at the bottom of a deep crevice
in the Great Northern Desert by members
of our Earth Probe Nimbus-IlI

NARRATOR
Our story begins sometime during the
latter half of Earths so-called Twentieth
Century Simple nuclear weapons had been
invented but used only twice to finish the
so-called Second World War

The Earth appears ahead of us continually growing to reveal the
shape of its continents and oceans

NARRATOR
We deal with the period following this
which was chiefly marked by the fact that
though every nation feared surprise attack
the full consequences of nuclear weapons
seemed to escape all governments and their
people

The Earth is quite close now its circumference almost filling the
screen

NARRATOR
The quirkish author of this ancient comedy
seems intentionally to have omitted the names
of specific countries possibly in the hope it
would land a certain Universality to his theme

Geographic details fill the screen
CUT TO
2 DAY - AIR SHOTS - B-90 STING RAY BOMBERS
Magnificent swept-wing eight-jet Mach 2 aircraft

NARRATOR
In order to guard against surprise attack
the nation in question kept seventy-five
B-90 Sting Ray bombers air-borne twenty-
four hours a day They were armed with
a full load of nuclear weapons

2a DAY - B-90s TAKING OFF

NARRATOR
As part of this air-borne alert thirty-five
B-90 Sting Ray bombers of the Air Commands
843rd Bomb Wing left the Burpelson Air Force
Base fourteen hours before

3 B-90 STING RAYS - FLYING

NARRATOR
The aircraft were now dispersed from the
Persian Gulf to the Arctic Ocean They had
only one geographical factor in common
They were all assigned targets inside enemy
territory

4 DAY - B-90 LEPER COLONY at 30000 FEET

NARRATOR
One of the 843ds aircraft the Leper
Colony was approaching its Positive-
Control point Bear Island a small dot
in the Barents Sea where it would turn
around and head for home

DOWN VIEW - STING RAY - FLYING SHOT

NARRATOR
Each Sting Ray carried a bomb load of
fifty megatons or fifty million tons of TNT
equal to fifteen times the total explosive
force of World War Two or twenty-five
thousand times the explosive force of the
Atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima

REAR VIEW - STING RAY - FLYING SHOT

NARRATOR
The long tense hours which always passed
with such agonizing slowness during the
twenty-four hours of an air-borne alert
now began to move quicker as the mission
passed its halfway mark

FRONT VIEW - STING RAY - FLYING SHOT
NARRATOR
The crew of the Leper Colony knew they
guarded the peace of the world just as
surely as they knew the price they must
pay within themselves to do it

MAJOR KONG

LT QUIFFER
(awe-struck)
War

CAPTAIN ANGST
(nodding gravely)
Yes that must be what it is

LT BALLMUFF
(aghast)
War
LT ZOGG
(stunned)
What else could it be

LT QUIFFER
Maybe its an exercise

LT BALLMUFF
Yeah to see if were on our toes

MAJOR KONG
(wisely)
No they wouldnt send us in with bombs
on an exercise

LT QUIFFER
Maybe they want to test our loyalty

CAPTAIN ANGST
But we got the Go-code Its never been
given to anyone before

MAJOR KONG
(scowling)
No this looks like the real thing

LT TOEJAM
(philosophically)
Yeah it sure looks like the real thing
all right

They all soberly reflect on the wider implications of the
news The BOMBARDIER cracks his knuckles

LT ZOGG
(shaking his head)
Its going to be rough on the folks
back home

LT BALLMUFF
Yeah - real rough

They all shake their heads in melancholy agreement

LT TOEJAM
I wonder how it started

CAPTAIN ANGST
Yes how could it have started

THE DSO shatter the calm dignity of the crew by raising
his voice

LT QUIFFER
The bastards must have hit us

LT BALLMUFF
Yeah - but why would they do that
Quentin

LT QUIFFER
How do I know But they must have We
wouldnt have started it

LT ZOGG
Hes right We wouldnt have started it

LT QUIFFER
(beginning to shout)
They must have clobbered some of our
cities already

LT ZOGG
Hes right They must have clobbered
some of our cities already

best of us Now lets get squared away

With various ad libs of agreement the crew scramble
back to their action stations

133 VARIOUS SHOTS - CREW

LIEUTENANT BALLMUFF opens a small safe and searches out a
thick 8 x 10 sealed envelope marked Plan-R from among a
dozen others

He shoots an inquiring look to the pilot and gets a nod
He breaks open the seal and distributes individual folders
to each of the crew

MAJOR KONG
Give me a first rough course as soon
as you can Lieutenant Ballmuff

LT BALLMUFF
Roughly one-zero-five Ill have it
plotted in a minute Major Kong

13k MS - MAJOR KONG
He adjusts the gyro banks the big plane and opens his folder

MAJOR KONG

(reading from his folder)
Okay Check these points Complete radio
silence To ensure that the enemy cant
plant false transmissions and fake orders
the CRM-114 is to be switched into all
receiver circuits The three code letters
of the period are to be set on the alphabet
dials of the CRM-114 which will in turn
block any transmissions other than those
preceded by the code letters You got it

LT TOEJAM
Roger Im setting up the CRM-114

MAJOR KONG
Primary target the ICBM base at Laputa
One weapon fused for air burst at ten thou-

malfunctions Otherwise the secondary gets
it - the airfield outside of Karnak Fused
air burst at ten thousand

While he talks other CUTS to the crew prepraring for battle

MAJOR KONG
In about twenty minutes we start losing
height to keep under coastal radar Cross
in over the coast low-level continue low-
level on zig-zag legs to primary and climb
for bomb run

(pause)
Any questions

LT ZOGG
Ive got one

MAJOR KONG
Shoot Lothar

LT ZOGG
Our targets are a missile complex and
an airfield - not cities right

MAJOR KONG
Thats what I said

LT ZOGG
Well if theres a war they must have
hit us first

MAJOR KONG
Whats your point Lothar

LT ZOGG
Well if they hit us first theyve probably
fired off their missiles and got their planes
off the ground already Well just be hitting
empty real estate

MAJOR KONG
Are you saying our order dont make sense

LT ZOGG
Hellnno Major I was just trying to think
the thing through

MAJOR KING KONG
Lothar youre down in the pay books as
a bombardier and youre a damned good

to give them

GENERAL SCHMUCK

It was a honest mista

ke sir

PRESIDENT MUFFLEY
I presume the planes are armed

he
GENERAL SCHMUCK
Im afraid so Mister Presient
Being part of the air-borne alert
each plane is carrying a full
load - about fifty megatons apiece

PRESIDENT MUFFLEY
Well what about the Positive Control
the safety catch Dont the planes
automatically come back unless they
get a second order

GENERAL SCHMUCK
Thats right sir But the planes
were at their Positive Control
points ready to turn around when
General Ripper issued the final
Go-code

PRESIDENT MUFFLEY
And I suppose theres some reason
why you havent recalled them

GENERAL SCHMUCK
Yes sir The base commander
General Ripper selected Plan-R

PRESIDENT MUFFLEY
What the hell is Plan-R

GENERAL SCHMUCK
Well sir Plan-R is an emergency
plan to be used by lower echelon
commanders if higher echelons
have been knocked out by a sneak
attack

PRESIDENT MUFFLEY
Why cant you cancel it

GENERAL SCHMUCK
Once the orders have been given
Plan-R requires any new orders
to be received on the CRM-114
in the aircraft But the CRM-114
will not receive any transmissions
unless they are preceded by the
proper three-letter code group

PRESIDENT MUFFLEY
And I suppose youre going to
tell me you dont know what the
three-letter code is

GENERAL SCHMUCK
Mister President to guard
against espionage the three
letter of the code group for
Plan-R are always selected
by the lower echelon commander
himself just before each
mission They are sealed in
the various attack plans and
are known only to the lower
echelon commander and his
deputy In this case the
deputy is air-borne with the
Wing and General Ripper
refuses to recall the planes

The PRESIDENT shakes his head wrathfully

PRESIDENT MUFFLEY
How soon until the enemy finds
out whats going on

GENERAL SCHMUCK
We estimate the planes should
be entering their coastal radar
cover in about twenty-five min-
utes

PRESIDENT MUFFLEY
How could you let this happen
General Schmuck

GENERAL SCHMUCK
Mister President I know you
think Ive let you down but
we had to have a Plan-R If
we completely centralized the
command and control alla
potential aggressor would
have to worry about was knock-
ing out maybe half a dozen
headquarters and the Capitol
and wed be out of business
Wed have planes and missiles
just sitting there while we
were getting clobbered

PRESIDENT MUFFLEY
Then theres no chance for
recall

GENERAL SCHMUCK
I should say practically none
though we have our communications
center plowing through every
possible three-letter combination
The trouble is that there are
about seventeen thousand permutations
and it will take us approximately
four and a half days to go through
them all

There is a knock at the door

PRESIDENT MUFFLEY
Yes what is it

MP CAPTAIN
Excuse me sir But the mess
orderlies are outside with the
breakfasts everyone ordered

PRESIDENT MUFFLEY
(waspishly)
Captain do you think the mess
orderlies would mind waiting
a few minutes until we have
finished our little meeting

MP CAPTAIN
(confused)
No sirI mean yes sir
Im sure they wouldnt

PRESIDENT MUFFLEY
(shouts)
Thank you Captain Now
shut the damned door

He shuts the door

PRESIDENT MUFFLEY (Cont)
I want to talk to the base
commander whats his name

GENERAL SCHMUCK
General Jack D Ripper sir

PRESIDENT MUFFLEY
I want to talk to General Ripper

GENERAL SCHMUCK
But we cant communicate with
the base

The PRESIDENT leans back and thinks for a moment
PRESIDENT MUFFLEY
General Faceman are there any
troops stationed near the base
who are not under General Rippers
command

All eyes go to GENERAL FLASH FACEMAN the Army Chief

GENERAL FLASH FACEMAN
I believe so Mister President

PRESIDENT MUFFLEY
(in burning sarcasm)
Is it possible for you to
know definitely General

GENERAL FLASH FACEMAN
Yes sir I can confirm it but
I believe theres a Special Services
outfit stationed just on the other
side of town about seven miles
away

PRESIDENT MUFFLEY
General Faceman I want you to get
on the phone yourself and speak to
the officer in charge --

GENERAL FACEMAN
Yes sir

PRESIDENT MUFFLEY

(rapid fire)
Please dont say yes sir until
Ive finished speaking Tell him
to get himself and his men moving
immediately I dont even want
them to waste time dressing Just
have them carry their weapons and
ammunition and move ‘em out by
any available means of transportation
If they dont have enough vehicles
commandeer cars off the highway
I want them there within fifteen
minutes And if he cant get them
all there get as many as he can
I want them to enter the base locate
General Ripper and immediately put
him in telephone contact with me
You understand dont you General

GENERAL FACEMAN
(starts out of room)
Yes sir One thing Mister President

PRESIDENT MUFFLEY
Yes

GENERAL FACEMAN
Under a condition red alert the
base will probably be sealed off
and defended by the base security
troops

PRESIDENT MUFFLEY
I am aware of what a condition
red alert implies

GENERAL FACEMAN
Well sir they may not allow
the Special Service troops to
enter the base

PRESIDENT MUFFLEY
(sarcastically)
Thats a very wise deduction
General

GENERAL FACEMAN
Thank you sir But what shall
I tell them to do if they are
denied entrance

The PRESIDENT rocks in his chair looking as if he were about
to explode

PRESIDENT MUFFLEY
Under the circumstances General
what would you think they should
do

GENERAL FACEMAN
WellI suppose penetrate the base
by force

PRESIDENT MUFFLEY
You see you knew the answer all
the time General

GENERAL FACEMAN
But that would mean some of our
own boys will get hurt Mister
President

PRESIDENT MUFFLEY
What do you suppose is going to
happen if General Rippers planes
start bombing their targets

GENERAL FACEMAN
That certainly would be a problem
sir

CADAVERLY
Mister President how do you feel
about Civil Defense

PRESIDENT MUFFLEY
Civil DefenseHm-mmmWe dont
want to cause an unnecessary panic

CADAVERLY
Shall we allow the situation to

mature a bit sir

PRESIDENT MUFFLEY
Yes I think thats the wisest
policy for the moment

MAJOR MANDRAKE closes the door behind him and sits

MAJOR MANDRAKE
(smiling nervously)
Whats the gun for General Ripper

GENERAL RIPPER
Please dont take any notice of this
weapon Major I love all weapons and
as of late Ive just taken to keeping
a loaded weapon nearby at all times

MAJOR MANDRAKE
(laughs shakily)
Sort of like a new hobby huh General

GENERAL RIPPER
Thats right Major

MAJOR MANDRAKE still holds the little transistor radio which softly
plays a rock and roll tune He smiles idiotically

GENERAL RIPPER
(softly)
I see youre playing your radio Major
Isnt that contrary to my instructions
for the personnel of this base

MAJOR MANDRAKE
Oh its not my radio sir I picked it

up in the communications center

GENERAL RIPPER
I didnt mean for anyone to play anyone elses
radio either Major

MAJOR MANDRAKE
Yes sir General can I ask a question

GENERAL RIPPER
Certainly Major Mandrake Youre a
good officer and you can ask me a question
any time you want to

MAJOR MANDRAKE
Well General Ripper sir -- I was
thinking -- were on a condition red
arent we

GENERAL RIPPER
That is correct Major

MAJOR MANDRAKE
And a condition red means enemy attack
in progress doesnt it

GENERAL RIPPER
You know the regulations well Major

MAJOR MANDRAKE
Well sir I was thinking if an enemy
attack is in progress how come the radios
still playing music Its supposed to go
off and all we should hear are Civil Defense
broadcasts

GENERAL RIPPER
Thats a good question Major Maybe if you
think hard you can think of the answer
yourself

MAJOR MANDRAKE
(timidly)
Well I was thinking maybe an enemy attack
is not in progress

GENERAL RIPPER
And if that were true

MAJOR MANDRAKE wrinkles his forehead apprehensively

MAJOR MANDRAKE
(cautiously)
But then sir why have you issued the order
Wing attack Plan-R

Because I thought it proper Major Why else
would you think Id do it

anyone can do about it now Im the only

Weve come a long way since World War II
Major And the lessons weve learned are

I suppose they are sir

GENERAL RIPPER
Youre damned right they are

GENERAL RIPPER
Just a squirt

He gives a squirt

MAJOR MANDRAKE

MAJOR MANDRAKE pours himself a big slug and keeps it straight

MAJOR MANDRAKE

What shall we drink to sir

GENERAL RIPPER
(with the eyes of a zealot)
To peace on earth

They touch glasses

MAJOR MANDRAKE
General Ripper can I ask another question

GENERAL RIPPER
Ask away Major

MAJOR MANDRAKE
Well General -- I was wondering why are
you doing this I mean why do you want to
start the war

GENERAL RIPPER
Ive given it alot of thought Major Dont
think I havent

MAJOR MANDRAKE
No sir I mean I didnt think you hadnt
given it a lot of thought

GENERAL RIPPER
Do you remember what Clemenceau once said
about war

MAJOR MANDRAKE
I dont think so sir

GENERAL RIPPER
He said war was too important a matter
to be left to Generals

MAJOR MANDRAKE
I see

GENERAL RIPPER
When he said it fifty years ago he might
have been right But today war is too
important to be left to the politicians Do
you follow me Major

MAJOR MANDRAKE
Im trying to sir
GENERAL RIPPER
You see Major at this very moment while
we sit and chat a decision is being made by
the President in the War Room He knows
that the enemy will pick up our planes on their
radar in about twenty minutes

MAJOR MANDRAKE
But when they do sir wont they hit back
with everything theyve got

GENERAL RIPPER
If we havent taken any further action they
certainly will Doyyourhappen to remember
the statistics on our casualties in the event
of a full-scale enemy attack

MAJOR MANDRAKE
Well I think I remember reading the report
on that Wasnt it something like a hundred
and sixty million

GENERAL RIPPER
Thats close enough Major

MAJOR MANDRAKE
But then why do you want to kill a hundred
and sixty million of our people sir

GENERAL RIPPER
Youre being dense Major I certainly dont

GENERAL RIPPER (Cont)
want to kill so many of our people And
neither does the President Now look
Major Mandrake What happens if the
President immediately orders our entire
missile force to hit enemy airfields
missiles and bases

MAJOR MANDRAKE
I suppose we might catch them off their
guard

GENERAL RIPPER
Our missiles would impact before my planes
were even discovered by the enemy wouldnt
they

MAJOR MANDRAKE
I guess so

GENERAL RIPPER
I know so Major I know so And add to that
the whole Air Command force being committed to
clobber everything theyve got
MAJOR MANDRAKE
But even then we wouldnt get everything I
mean some missiles would abort or theyd miss
their targets or maybe the enemy have some
secret bases we dont know about

GENERAL RIPPER
Youre absolutely right You forgot to mention
their nuclear subs But it wouldnt matter
Sure we wouldnt get off without getting our
hair mussed but wed prevail I dont think
wed lose more than fifty million people tops

MAJOR MANDRAKE
(hesitatingly)
But if you just let things alone we wouldnt
lose anyone

GENERAL RIPPER
Major Mandrake I guess you dont follow whats
going on too closely do you

MAJOR MANDRAKE
Where sir

GENERAL RIPPER
(smiles patronisingly)
Where Everywhere Major Everywhere

MAJOR MANDRAKE nods blankly

GENERAL RIPPER (Cont)
Have you read much about the disarmament
talks Major

MAJOR MANDRAKE
Well I know theyve been going on for
years and they havent gotten any place

GENERAL RIPPER
Not yet Major Not yet

MAJOR MANDRAKE
And I guess they wont until they agree to
let us inspect inside their country

GENERAL RIPPER
Youre very naive Major Dont they say
they want disarmament

MAJOR MANDRAKE
Yes sir But so do we

GENERAL RIPPER
But we mean it because we are a peace-
loving country Are they a peace-loving
country Major

MAJOR MANDRAKE
I dont know sir But theyre just as
anxious to avoid a nuclear war as we are
War just doesnt make sense any more for
anybody

GENERAL RIPPER
But war doesnt make sense precisely because
the weapons can kill an entire country -- right

MAJOR MANDRAKE
Right

GENERAL RIPPER
(the prosecutor makes
his point)
Then dont you realize the Bomb gives us
Peace not War And if thats the case I
ask you again Why do they want disarmament

MAJOR MANDRAKE

(despairing)
Well sir like I said for the same reasons
we do I mean all the experts say the most
likely way for War to start nowadays is by
an accident or a mistake or by some mentally
unbalanced person --

(lets his voice trail off)

MANDRAKEs discretion was unnecessary for it would never occur
to GENERAL RIPPER that anyone would think him mentally unbalanced

GENERAL RIPPER
Go on Major

MAJOR MANDRAKE
(gaining confidence)
I was just going to say as long as the
weapons exist sooner or later somethings
going to happen -- and thatll be it for
both countries

GENERAL RIPPER
Ive heard the arguments Like Napoleons
quote Theres one thing you cant do with
a bayonet and thats - sit on it

MAJOR MANDRAKE
Thats right sir And dont forget ina
few years a lot of other countries will have
the bomb What if they start something

GENERAL RIPPER
Go on Major You fascinate me
MAJOR MANDRAKE
Well sir I remember an example that pointed
out that if a system was safe on 9999 of the
days of the year given average luck it would
fail in thirty years

MAJOR MANDRAKE pauses to look for daylight RIPPER returns his
gaze steadily

GENERAL RIPPER
I still ask why do they want disarmament

MAJOR MANDRAKE
Well for the same reasons we do sir
Dont you see

GENERAL RIPPER
No Major I dont They have no regard
for human life They wouldnt care if
they lost their whole country as long as
they won

MAJOR MANDRAKE
Gee sir that last remark doesnt exactly
make all the sense in the world

GENERAL RIPPER
(angrily)
Major youre talking like one of them

MAJOR MANDRAKE
(shook)
Well Im not sir Honestly sir

GENERAL RIPPER
Dont be offended Major Our President
holds the same views

MAJOR MANDRAKE
Dont you think he knows something about
this General Ripper

GENERAL RIPPER
Ill tell you what I do think If they say
theyre for disarmament I say anyone who
says theyre for disarmament is either a
traitor or a damned fool

MAJOR MANDRAKE
But General were on our toes We havent
agreed to anything for years Inffact a
a lot of people say we never will

GENERAL RIPPER
But if they suddenly opened up and gave us
the inspection we want wed agree wouldnt
we

MAJOR MANDRAKE
If they gave us what we think we need yes
I guess we would

GENERAL RIPPER
And youd like to see that

MAJOR MANDRAKE
General whats good enough for the
President and all the experts hes got
working on the thing is good enough for
me

GENERAL RIPPER
Do you think wed cheat

MAJOR MANDRAKE
No sir Im sure we wouldnt

GENERAL RIPPER
Do you think they would cheat

MAJOR MANDRAKE
Look sir Im no expert on the subject
but Ive read some pretty sharp ideas the
big boys have Like say both countries
agreeing to a million dollar reward and
international protection for anyone who
gives evidence of cheating to the inspectors
You cant hide those things without a lot of
people knowing about it And if I were
going to try and hide a few I wouldnt want
to depend on the fact that some poor slob
isnt going to run and blab for a million
bucks Were as smart as they are and if
they cheat or even hold back information
wed pull right out

GENERAL RIPPER
(shaking his head)
Major I hate to say this but I think youve
been enemy indoctrinated and you dont even
know it

DAWN - EXT GOVERNEMT BUILDING

INT WAR ROOM - COMMAND BRIDGE

Air Force General BUCK SCHMUCK is speaking as the scene opens
The huge polished wood table is neatly spread with the remains of
breakfast Eggs and bacon melon toast silver thermos jugs of

coffee pastries and glasses of ice water

GENERAL BUCK SCHMUCK
In conclusion I should like to observe that
One our hopes for recalling the 843rd Bomb
Wing are next to nothing Two in about
fifteen minutes the enemy will be making radar
contacts with our planes Three when they
do they will go absolutely Ape and strike
back with everything theyve got Four if
prior to this we havent done anything to
suppress their retaliatory abilities we will
suffer virtual annihilation - in round numbers
a hundred and fifty million killed Five if
we immediately launch an all-out missile
attack on their bases we stand an excellent
chance of catching them off guard In that
event we will destroy the bulk of their
retaliatory strength prevail in the struggle
and suffer relatively modest and acceptable
civilian casualties

He pauses and confidently looks around the table The PRESIDENT

stares at him inscrutably

GENERAL BUCK SCHMUCK

If I may Id like to illustrate my conclusion
with a very brief story

(a squinty-eyed smile)
I played guard on my high-school football team
I wasnt particularly big for the line and my
coach once told me something Ive never for-
gotten Schmucko he said - that was what
they called me in those days - Schmucko
always remember this The harder you hit
the other fellow the less youll get hurt

(confidently checks each game)
My recommendation is that we follow General
Rippers action to its logical end In
other words to hit the other fellow as hard as
we can

No one says anything
ADMIRAL PERCY BULDIKE
Whats your estimate of casualties if we

strike first

ADMIRAL PERCY BULDIKE is a model of the crisp tough

Navy man His lean rugged features are lit by an obvious intelligence

GENERAL BUCK SCHMUCK
Under those circumstances oh Id say for us
twenty to fifty million depending on the breaks
For the enemy something on the order of fifty
million if we stick to military targets

ADMIRAL PERCY BULDIKE
You are very casual about those figures
General Schmuck
GENERAL BUCK SCHMUCK
Not at all Admiral Buldike Naturally we all
deeply regret such a sad loss - and let me be
the first to say I dont like the idea one bit
that wed be clobbering their women and children
But quit a few of their bases are very close to
cities and towns and to would be unavoidable

PRESIDENT MUFFLEY

Well gentlemen do you concur with General
Schmuck

There is a nervous silence

GENERAL BUCK SCHMUCK
Mister President regretable as such a choice
is there is a quantitative difference between
fifty and a hundred and fifty million of our
dead

PRESIDENT
Buck Suppose I said to you I was going to cut
away one quarter of your body - but not to worry
because youd still be three-quarters good
even if that three-quarters was rather monstrously
deformed and helplessly crippled

GENERAL SCHMUCK
I dont think thats a fair analogy sir

INT GENERAL JACK D RIPPERS OFFICE

The popping of small arms fire outside RIPPER still has MAJOR
MANDRAKE at the mercy of his 45

Stray bursts of small arms fire have smashed the windows and
occasionally a few shots tear up the wall Both men are on the floor

GENERAL RIPPER is philosophically drunk and very sentimental

GENERAL RIPPER
(sitting on the floor)
You know when I was a kid I used to read a
lot I loved to read One of my favorites
was the Jungle Book by Kipling Did you
ever read it Major

MAJOR MANDRAKE lies flat on the floor and trembles with fear

MAJOR MANDRAKE
I dont think so

A rifle shot splatters the window again MANDRAKE flinches

GENERAL RIPPER

You should In particular read the story

of the little mongoose called Riki-tiki-tavi
because of the noise he made He was taken

in as a house pet In the garden of the

house lived a couple of cobras and pretty
soon the mongoose kills the male cobra because
hes laying for the man of the house

MAJOR MANDRAKE manages a brave but idiotic smile

GENERAL RIPPER
But the female cobra is left and shes got
a clutch of eggs which will hatch a dozen
young cobras She decides Riki has to go
She says so and she means it The little
mongoose weighs up the odds He can handle
the cobra if she comes after him He just
has to keep his eyes open and be ready for
her at any time But once the eggs hatch
and the young cobras become dangerous -
hes gone He cant handle that many at
once

A longish burst of automatic fire rakes across the wall window
height dropping three framed 8 x 10 photographs of Air Force
Generals

GENERAL RIPPER
So he waits his chance and when the female
cobra is causing mischief somewhere else he
breaks the eggs He has to kill the young
cobras since its just a matter of time
before they kill him So he acts and he lives
He is safe the people in the house are safe
They can live their lives in peace

GENERAL RIPPER is glassy-eyed with emotion MAJOR MANDRAKE nods
stupidly

GENERAL RIPPER
Major pour two more drinks please

MAJOR MANDRAKE creeps to the bar

GENERAL RIPPER
(as if MANDRAKE were somehow
derelict in his duty)
Major those are my boys out there dying

MAJOR MANDRAKE
(making drinks)
Yes sir Why dont you stop the fighting
sir

GENERAL RIPPER looks at his watch and begins to nod He keeps
nodding for about thirty seconds

GENERAL RIPPER
Youre a good officer Major Mandrake You
think of your men first

MAJOR MANDRAKE crawls over with the drinks

GENERAL RIPPER
(raising glass moodily)
To peace on earth Major

MAJOR MANDRAKE
(mumbles)
Peace on earth

They drink RIPPER starts nodding again
RIPPER picks up the pa mike and fumbles for the switch

GENERAL RIPPER
This is General Ripper speaking There
has been an unfortunate mistake You have
been fighting our own troops They are not
saboteurs You will cease fire immediately
I repeat cease fire imediately Good
work men Im proud of you

Shuts off button
MAJOR MANDRAKE

General now that youve done that I beg
you to recall the Wing
GENERAL RIPPER
Major I happen to believe in a life
after this one so I believe I will have
to answer for what I have done I think
I can

They touch glasses and drink

GENERAL

AMBASSADOR DE SADE
(shaking his head)
It was to have been announced at the party
congress next week I did not know the
fools would make it operational until then

is plainly shaken and swallows some iced water
GENERAL FACEMAN
(skeptical)
Well what the hell is a Doomsday Machine
AMBASSADOR DE SADE
(pale)

May I have a cigarette

FACEMAN gives him a cigarette and lights it as he

continues

AMBASSADOR DE SADE

(shaking his head)
Well its ridiculously simple really
As you all know the intense lethal radio-
activity from a so-called normal nuclear
device dissipates itself at a certain rate
Something like ss after the first
hours after twenty-four hours
until at the end of a week its just
of its lethal dose

He takes a deep drag on the cigarette holds it and exhales

AMBASSADOR DE SADE
Well it has been explained to me that
if you add a thick Cobalt-Thorium-G
jacket to a nuclear device the radio-
activity resulting from such a nuclear
explosion will retain its lethal power
for a hundred years

AMBASSADOR DE SADE

(continuing)
Our scientists calculated that the detonation
of fifty of our biggest nuclear devices
jacketed in Cobalt-Thorium-G would enshroud
the earth in a hundred years of lethal radio-
activity from which no human life could escape
In ten months the Earth would be as dead as
the Moon

PRESIDENT MUFFLEY
Where is thisthing

AMBASSADOR DE SADE
It is buried somewhere in the Grudd
Mountains

GENERAL SCHMUCK
(suspiciously)
Do you mean to say youd set it off in your
own country

AMBASSADOR DE SADE
Naturally It would kill us just as surely
even if we set it off in your country But
this way we know its safe and we dont have
the problem of delivering it

GENERAL SCHMUCK
Mister President I cant buy this malarkey
they wouldnt set the damn thing off Why
should they

AMBASSADOR DE SADE
Youre absolutely right We wouldnt No
sane nation ever would Thats why it was
designed to trigger itself automatically

GENERAL SCHMUCK
Then all you have to do is untrigger it

AMBASSADOR DE SADE
Ah but if we were able to untrigger it that
would be defeating its purpose All our
enemies would have to do would be to warn us
in advance that they were going to violate one
of our unalterable triggering conditions

We would bluff naturally but in the end

we would be insane not to untrigger it

Now we can say There is no point trying

to intimidate us we dont control the
Doomsday Machine

PRESIDENT MUFFLEY
(scornfully)
Mister Ambassador what on earth possessed
your country to build this weapon

AMBASSADOR DE SADE
First of all economic reasons It was
cheap The entire project cost just a
fraction of what we spent in a single year
on our various space and missile programs
It also seemed ideal in most other respects
It was terrifying convincing automatic
and extremely simple to understand

He puffs the cigarette

AMBASSADOR DE SADE
Still any of our leaders opposed it on
the grounds Yes all well and good but
what happens if it has to be used

He sighs

AMBASSADOR DE SADE
But finally one factor tipped the scales
We received information from a very re-
liable source that your country was going
to build one

PRESIDENT MUFFLEY
Thats preposterous We have no such
program

AMBASSADOR DE SADE
The source wasshall we say completely
reliable

PRESIDENT MUFFLEY
The report is entirely untrue I can assure
you of that

GENERAL SCHMUCK
Damn it Mister President Ive been
warning for years that were still riddled
with traitors

While the following dialogue continues MOFFO enters with a
large tray of food As unobtrusively as possible he places
on the conference table and AMBASSADOR DE SADE pulls up a chair

you could not expect us to believe he would be

stands motionless and expressionless in the bullet-splattered office

moves and reveals GENERAL RIPPER grotesquely sprawled face down
on the floor behind his desk the 45 nearby

MANDRAKE kneels next to RIPPER and confirms he is dead
MANDRAKE rises and leans on the desk

He sees a wallet of photographs neatly laid out obviously RIPPERs
mother and father

Examining the clutter on RIPPERs desk he notices a ruled yellow
legal-size tablet There are a number of boxes heavily drawn

MAJOR MANDRAKE
I think that just might be it Although it
could be Riki-Tiki-Tavi

COLONEL BAT GUANO

What are you talking about Major

MAJOR MANDRAKE

combinations

COLONEL BAT GUANO

Get a grip on yourself Major

MAJOR MANDRAKE
It might still be worth trying Riki-Tiki-

with you and settle this thing Right now
my orders are to locate General Ripper and
put him on the phone with the President

MAJOR MANDRAKE
Well you cant do that because hes dead

He points to the floor behind the desk COLONEL GUANO steps
forward and looks at the body He kneels and examines the body
suspiciously

COLONEL GUANO moves carefully to the other side of the desk
unslings his carbine and covers MAJOR MANDRAKE

COLONEL GUANO
Do you have any witnesses Major

MAJOR MANDRAKE
What

COLONEL GUANO
What happened Major Some kind of
private beef between the two of you

MAJOR MANDRAKE
(incredulous)

COLONEL GUANO
Well have to leave that up to the CID
boys wont we Major

MAJOR MANDRAKE
Look Colonel Ive got to talk to somebody
at Air Command

COLONEL GUANO
Dont worry Major Your rights will be
fully protected

MAJOR MANDRAKE
Colonel dont you know whats going on

COLONEL GUANO

on the base and you killed General Ripper

MAJOR MANDRAKE
Look General Ripper went off his rocker and
ordered the 843rd Bomb Wing to attack with
H-bombs

COLONEL GUANO

to move)

MAJOR MANDRAKE
Suresure Colonel Now look Im picking

HelloHelloGee it must be edad
Probably the lines were hit during the fighting

GUANO watches him like a hawk

MAJOR MANDRAKE
Now look Im picking up this ordinary
telephone SeeHelloHello
Nuts the lines must still be disconnected
(he smiles idiotically)
The General had us disconnect
(he lets his voice trail off
when he sees RUDLEYs weird look
of hatred and suspicion)

MAJOR MANDRAKE

(desperately)
Look Colonel Maybe its too late
Maybe theyve sent Air Command in
already But weve got to try to con-
tact somebody

COLONEL GUANO
On your feet fella Ive got to get
outside and see how my men are

MAJOR MANDRAKE
Okay Colonel But look theres a pay
phone just outside in the hall Maybe

Mister President Gentlemen we are

What
Wow

You mean that was it
The old know-how

GENERAL SCHMUCK basks in the grandeur of the moment

GENERAL SCHMUCK
It was a variation of Peace on Earth -
OPE to be exact

AD LIBS
(overlapping)
Can you beat that
Peace on Earth
Brother
The human mind sure is amazing

PRESIDENT MUFFLEY
Have you received acknowledgements from
every plane

GENERAL SCHMUCK
Theyre coming in now

PRESIDENT MUFFLEY
How long will it take to receive them all

GENERAL SCHMUCK
Im not certain Mister President The boys
in CONCOM do the pencil work

The tone of GENERAL SCHMUCKs remark is as if to say
your errand boy

PRESIDENT MUFFLEY
General Schmuck if you dont know the
answer please find out

I am not
GENERAL SCHMUCK decides against a head-on collision

AMBASSADOR DE SADE stands with a flourish of contempt

GENERAL SCHMUCK
I believe it will be just a few minutes at the
most

PRESIDENT MUFFLEY
How many planes did we lose

GENERAL SCHMUCK
Im not certain Mister President But I believe
it was four

PRESIDENT MUFFLEY
General Faceman what was the name of the
officer who called me from Burpelson

GENERAL FACEMAN
I didnt speak to him sir But Colonel Bat
Guano was in command of the Special Service
battalion so I would imagine he did

PRESIDENT MUFFLEY
I want him upped to Brigadier General and
recomended for the DSC

GENERAL FACEMAN
(beaming)
Yes sir

GENERAL SCHMUCK
I dont know about the rest of you Gentlemen
but Im going to get down on my knees and
say a short prayer of thanks

away his breakfast tray

AMBASSADOR DE SADE
Excuse me but Im afraid I have many more
urgent things to attend to I should appreciate
it if you would delay your pious moment long
enough for me to say something

His tone of voice is loaded with contempt challenge and atheism

PRESIDENT MUFFLEY
(darkly)
Yes

AMBASSADOR DE SADE
Allow me to assure you that my government
will not be satisfied with a polite note of
regret for this shocking example of aggression
against our peace-loving people

THE PRESIDENT has just about had it with De Sade and is stung

pushing
by the rudeness of his tone

PRESIDENT MUFFLEY
Damn you de Sade You know as well as I do
that this was the act of a mentally sick man -
a single individual whose crack-up can probably
be traced to the strains and tensions caused by
your country

AMBASSADOR DE SADE
(haughtily)
It is very convenient to place all the blame on
a dead man

PRESIDENT MUFFLEY
(fiercely)
How dare you talk to me in this manner

AMBASSADOR DE SADE scornfully replies with silence

PRESIDENT MUFFLEY
(boiling with indignation)
This dreadful accident could never have happened
if your government hadnt cynically and hypocritic-
ally blocked every proposal we made for disarmament
or arms control

AMBASSADOR DE SADE

(waspishly)
Bah All you wanted to do was spy in our
country

PRESIDENT MUFFLEY
(wrathfully)
Thats nonsense and you know it

AMBASSADOR DE SADE
(acrimoniously)
I know nothing of the sort

PRESIDENT MUFFLEY
(exasperated)
Surely you dont expect us to destroy our
weapons without being able to verify that
you are doing the same

AMBASSADOR DE SADE
And surely you dont expect us to let you spy
in our country before you destroy your weapons

PRESIDENT MUFFLEY
(savagely)
Dont you realize that despite your incredible
distrust and suspicion that in fact you place a
far greater trust in us than inspection would
require You trust us not to cause a war accidentally
- and of course we are obliged to place the same

trust in you
The PRESIDENT walks close to DE SADE eyes flashing

PRESIDENT MUFFLEY

(raging)
Is there a single phase of human activity that is
free from the idiotic mischance How often do we
read of banks adding three zeros to a hundred
dollar deposit Or the Postal Department engraving
a stamp with the wrong amount Or an operation
performed on the wrong patient

The PRESIDENT continues with mounting fury

PRESIDENT MUFFLEY

(shouting rabidly)
The bomb may deter a rational leader from
choosing deliberate war but it cannot deter
a madman or a short-circuit or an error in
judgment And since neither of us can reduce
the chances for the idiotic mischance to
zero it simply becomes a question of when

Why cant he help me now Hes sitting

MAJOR KONG

Lieutenant Quiffer were all sorry you were
hit and well help you stick it together as
soon as we get squared away

MAJOR KONG
All right then heres the situation
With our ECM and staying on the deck they
shouldnt be able to track us on radar
We should make it to the primary and take
out the missile base Were burning up alot
of fuel at this altitude and we may not make
it back to a useable base But I think theres
an excellent chance to bail out over neutral
territory

has closed a deal The Ambassador is still there

thirty-fourThats right - we figure
four shot downAre you sure of that

I seeWill you hold it for a second

The PRESIDENT covers the phone and fixes a withering look on
GENERAL BUCK SCHMUCK

PRESIDENT MUFFLEY
General Schmuck are you positive of your
figures

GENERAL SCHMUCK
Naturally I am sir

PRESIDENT MUFFLEY
He says theyve only shot down three planes

GENERAL SCHMUCK
Well if you choose to take his word over
mine ---

PRESIDENT MUFFLEY
Look hes there and youre here

GENERAL SCHMUCK
(nettled)
Mister President there were thirty-four
aircraft involved Thirty acknowledged
the recall That makes four shot down

PRESIDENT MUFFLEY
(back to phone)
Hello are you still thereUh-huhI1ll
be right back Were still working this thing out

Covering the phone the PRESIDENT directs himself again to
SCHMUCK

PRESIDENT MUFFLEY
How do you know they were shot down Buck

GENERAL SCHMUCK
Well just common sense sir Thirty from
thirty-four equals four or my names not
Buck Schmuck

The PRESIDENT dolefully digests GENERAL SCHMUCKs logic
There is a low squawking sound from the telephone

PRESIDENT MUFFLEY
HelloYesWhatUh-huhYoure
absolutely certain

(sighs)
Hold it a second will you

(covers phone)
He says theyve just received a report of a
single low-flying B-90 apparently still
continuing on an attack mission to what they
assume would be a missile complex at a place
called Laputa

Impossible
Ridiculous

During the last part of the PRESIDENTs speech another phone rang
several times TURGIDSON picked it up and talked in hushed tones

TURGIDSON

General Schmuck its Miss Milky Way again

GENERAL SCHMUCK
Good Lord Turgidson I cant talk to her now

TURGIDSON

GENERAL SCHMUCK
Well sir it looks like one aircraft the
Leper Colony failed to receive the recall

PRESIDENT MUFFLEY
Have you tried the recall again

GENERAL SCHMUCK
Yes sir Were still sending it But its
a funny thing we dont seem to be able to make
any contact with the aircraft at all

PRESIDENT MUFFLEY
Whats the target

GENERAL SCHMUCK
Well the Premier doped it out pretty well
Its primary is their missile base at Laputa

The PRESIDENT slumps into a chair

PRESIDENT MUFFLEY
(mournfully)
Is there any chance a single aircraft can
penetrate the entire enemy Air Defense when
its course and target are known

GENERAL SCHMUCK

(glancing at the AMBASSADOR)
If I can speak freely sir -- look these guys
talk big but frankly we think theyre short of
know-how You cant just take a bunch of ignorant
peasants and expect them to understand a machine
like one of our boys and I dont mean that as an
insult Mister Ambassador Hell we all know what

The seating arrangement in the B-90 is such that the upper deck
places the DSO and the radio man about ten feet behind the pilot
and co-pilot facing the tail of the plane

The bombardier and the navigator sit facing forward on a second

look

No I think it means Recall period Mistake
and the OPE is probably the CRM-114 code

What are you talking about

LT TOEJAM hops forward again

LT TOEJAM
Yep its the CRM-114 code all right

MAJOR KONG
Very interesting

LT ZOGG
What do you mean

MAJOR KONG
Well we sure as hell arent going home just
because the enemy tells us to

LT ZOGG
Wait a minute Major OPE thats the
recall code Where would they get that

MAJOR KONG
You tell me

LT ZOGG
They must have gotten it from the base
No one else would know it

MAJOR KONG
Why should they call us back

LT ZOGG
How the hell do I know Maybe the wars
over

LT TOEJAM
(bewildered)
Could be

LT QUIFFER
(wistfully)
I hope we won

MAJOR KONG
Lieutenant Zogg what do our orders say
about the authentication of orders during
an attack mission

LT ZOGG
Look this is different

MAJOR KONG
Our orders warn us to expect the enemy to
use ingenuity in issuing contrary and confusing
orders And therefore to disregard anything
that doesnt come on the CRM-114

LT ZOGG
But the CRM-114 has been smashed for almost
an hour

MAJOR KONG
Then that settles it doesnt it

LT ZOGG
Like hell it does

MAJOR KONG
(impatiently)
The CRM-114 is smashed right

LT ZOGG
Right So how could we get any messages

MAJOR KONG
(ruffled)
Thats the point

LT ZOGG
I dont get you King

MAJOR KONG
I said thats the point

LT ZOGG
Look King maybe youve lost too much
blood or something

MAJOR KONG
(explodes)
Lieutentant Zogg how would you like your
black butt slung into a General Court Martial
when we get back

LT ZOGG
Take it easy Major Kong

MAJOR KONG
Then get off my back

LT TOEJAM
I think Major Kongs right Lothar I mean
we got the attack order from base and Plan -R
is an emergency plan for a base commander
after a lot of other plans have been clobbered

LT ZOGG
Okay You tell me how the enemy got the code
Its put in our sealed plans at the base just
before we take off

MAJOR KONG
There are plenty of traitors and spies running
around loose

LT ZOGG
But the code is made up by General Ripper and
hes the only one left at the base who would know
the code

MAJOR KONG
Nobodys loyalty is beyond question Besides
how do we know one of his staff didnt see it

LT ZOGG
Come on King That doesnt make sense

MAJOR KONG
(triumphantly)
Okay how do we know they didnt shoot down
one of our planes and torture the crew How
do we know that

LT ZOGG frowns

MAJOR KONG
(the clincher)
We crossed the coast over an hour ago
Okay

LT ZOGG
(after some thought)
Youre giving them an awful lot of credit
for being on the ball

ought to

You know I can see twenty forty a hundred
million - but everybody Its just a damned
shame and I dont mind saying so

He says

ZLAT
(responsibility weighs heavy)
Mister President how are we going to break it
to the people I mean its going to do one hell of
a thing to your image

The PRESIDENT shrugs irritably

VON KLUTZ
(with Germanic coolness)
Mister Ambassador how long will it take

The AMBASSADOR looks up wearily

AMBASSADOR DE SADE
(gesturing with both hands
Four - possibly six months in the Northern
Hemispheres Perhaps a year in the Southern
latitudes

VON KLUTZ
(wiping his steel-rimmed
glasses)
Mister President I wouldnot rule out the
chance to preserve a nucleus of human
specimens at the bottom shafts of some
of our deepest mines

PRESIDENT MUFFLEY
(tiredly)
At the bottom of mines

VON KLUTZ
(carefully putting on glasses
Yes The radioactivity could not penetrate
a mine some thousands of feet deep

The PRESIDENT looks blankly at VON KLUTZ

VON KLUTZ
In a matter of weeks sufficient improvements
for a dwelling space could be provided

PRESIDENT MUFFLEY
But they couldnt come out for a hundred
years

VON KLUTZ
(smiling wisely)
Mister President man is an amazingly adaptable
creature After all the conditions would be
far superior to those say of the Nazi concentration
camps where there is ample evidence most of the
wretched creatures clung desperately to life

Although the PRESIDENT seems unconvinced looking around the
room it is apparent VON KLUTZs proposal has not fallen upon
deaf ears

VON KLUTZ

(smiling modestly)
It would not be difficult Nuclear reactors
could provide power almost indefinitely
Greenhouses could maintain plant life
Animals could be bred and slaughtered
A quick survey would have to be made of all
the suitable minesites in the country but
I shouldnt be surprised if several hundred
thousand of our people could be accomodatedd
Every nation would undoubtedly follow suit

PRESIDENT MUFFLEY
But who would be chosen

VON KLUTZ
A special committee would have to be appointed
to study and recommend the criteria to be
employed but off-hand I should say that in
addition to the factors of youth health sexual
fertility intelligence and a cross-section of
necessary skills it would be absolutely vital
that our top government and military men be
included to impart the required principles of
leadership and tradition

The arrow has not missed its mark and there is an outbreak of
sober nodding heads

VON KLUTZ

(laughs distastefully)
Naturally they would breed prodigiously eh
There would be much time and little to do
With the proper breeding techniques and starting
with a ratio of say ten women to each man
I should estimate the progeny of the original
group of 200000 would emerge a hundred years
later as well over a hundred million Naturally
the group would have to continually engage in
enlarging the original living space

Much serious judgment is brought to bear around the table Pencils
are brought into action

VON KLUTZ

When they emerge a good deal of present real
estate and machine tools will still be recoverable
if they are moth-balled in advance I would guess
they could then work their way back to our present
gross national product within twenty years

PRESIDENT MUFFLEY
But look here Von Klutz Wont this nucleus
of survivors be so shocked grief-stricken and
anguished that they will envy the dead and indeed
not wish to go on living

VON KLUTZ
Certainly not sir When they go down into the
mine everyone else will still be alive They will
have no shocking memories and the prevailing
emotion should be one of a nostalgia for those

VON KLUTZ (Cont)
left behind combined with a spirit of bold
curiousity for the adventure ahead

GENERAL SCHMUCK
(judiciously)
You mentioned the ratio of ten women to each
man Wouldnt that necessitate abandoning the
so-called monogamous form of sexual relation-
ship

VON KLUTZ
Regrettably yes But it is a sacrifice required
for the future of the human race I hasten to
add that since each man will be required to
perform prodigious service along these lines
the women will have to be selected for their
sexual characteristics which will have to be
of a highly stimulating order

AMBASSADOR DE SADE
(enthusiastically)
Von Klutz I must confess you have an astonish-
ingly good idea there

VON KLUTZ
(correctly)
Thank you sir

AMBASSADOR DE SADE rises

AMBASSADOR DE SADE
(briskly)
And now Mister President I must return
at once to my embassy to communicate this
reassuring news to the Premier

PRESIDENT MUFFLEY
(shaking hands)
Goodbye Mister Ambassador

AMBASSADOR DE SADE
(at the door)
We have many splendidly deep mines in our
country

He exits

GENERAL SCHMUCK
(thoughtfully)
Mister President I think weve got to look
into this thing from the military point of view
I mean if the enemy stashed away some big
bombs and we didnt when they come out in
a hundred years they could take over

GENERAL FACEMAN
Thats right sir In fact they might even
try a quick sneak attack so they can take
over our mine-shaft space

ADMIRAL BULDIKE
They might even try to knock over a couple
of other countries and take their mine-shaft
space If they had more mine-shaft space
than we did they could breed more and possibly
take over when they come out

GENERAL SCHMUCK
We must not allow a mine-shaft gap

The phone rings ADMIRAL BULDIKE picks it up

ADMIRAL BULDIKE
GENERAL

HelloYes just a minute
(to GENERAL SCHMUCK)
Its personal

SCHMUCK takes the phone

GENERAL SCHMUCK
(charmingly)
YesWell pretty soon dear Yes
Ive finished my business Uh-huh
Uh-huh
(laughs)
Yes dear Same here Bye-bye

Hangs up the phone

There is a knock at the door Enter AMBASSADOR DE SADE

AMBASSADOR DE SADE
(haughtily)
Excuse me Mister President but you forgot
to give me my camera back

PRESIDENT MUFFLEY
(fishes in pocket for Minox)
Oh yes thats right

GENERAL BUCK SCHMUCK
Just a second sir Hes got films of the
War Room in that thing

PRESIDENT MUFFLEY
Im afraid Ill have to ask you to take the
film out

AMBASSADOR DE SADE
(annoyed)
Very well

GENERAL BUCK SCHMUCK
You know sir that camera might be a dummy
he wanted us to find Hes probably got another
one secreted on his person

AMBASSADOR DE SADE
(sputtering)
Thats utterly ridiculous

GENERAL BUCK SCHMUCK
Hes been here for almost two hours and Lord
knows what hes photographed Id have him
stripped and give a thorough body search

AMBASSADOR DE SADE
(appalled)
Thats preposterous I object
The PRESIDENT thinks for a moment

PRESIDENT MUFFLEY
(reassuringly)
Im afraid well have to - purely as a formality
Ambassador de Sade Zlat will you call the
Secret Service and have them prepare a private
room upstairs for a body search

The AMBASSADOR is shocked and angry

AMBASSADOR DE SADE
Please Mister President I am extremely shy
and do not wish to endure this sort of personal
humiliation Here is the only other camera I
have left
(he produces a second camera)

GENERAL SCHMUCK
See See I told you

PRESIDENT MUFFLEY
(shaking his head)
Youve lied to me twice - Im sorry but it will
be strictly routine These men are experts

GENERAL SCHMUCK
Zlat make sure the secret service boys care-
fully search his seven body orifices

AMBASSADOR DE SADE
(horrified)
My seven body orifices

GENERAL SCHMUCK
Thats right fella

AMBASSADOR DE SADE
(touches ears)
One two
(touches each nostril)
three four
(touches mouth)
five
(freezes turns red and
swallows hard)
Why you dirty stinking

AMBASSADOR DE SADE picks up a thick custard pie from among a
large selection of pies previously brought into the room with coffee
and smashes it into GENERAL SCHMUCKs angry face

GENERAL SCHMUCK hurls a coconut cream pie at DE SADE who ducks
It splatters into the face of ADMIRAL PERCY BULDIKE

Not realizing why he has been hit ADMIRAL PERCY BULDIKE flings
a chocolate cream pie at GENERAL BUCK SCHMUCK It misses and

plops into PRESIDENT MUFFLEYs face

And as is the case with the great-pie throwing scenes misunderstand-
ing piles upon misunderstanding until everyone in the room is hectic-
ally engaged in splattering pies into each others face

CUT TO
MOVING SHOT - PULL AWAY FROM PLANET EARTH
into outer space (A reverse of the opening shot)

NARRATOR
Though the little-known dead planet
Earth remotely situated in the Milky
Way Galaxy is admittedly of little
interest to us today we have presented
this quaint comedy of Galaxy pre-history
when the primitive organization of
sovereign nation states still flourished
and the archaic institution of War had
not yet been forbidden by Law as another
in our series The Dead Worlds of Antiquity
