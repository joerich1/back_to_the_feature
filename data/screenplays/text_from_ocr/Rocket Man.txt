INT CORRIDOR HOSPITAL - DAY 1

ELTON JOHN in a sequined and feathered catsuit storms along
a halo of coloured feathers and enormous stained-glass
spectacles He is a man with a purpose but looks like shit

INT THERAPY ROOM PARKLANDS HOSPITAL - DAY 2
Elton sits dramatically in the seat and stares

confrontationally at the circle of addicts He sweats
profusely

ELTON
How long is this going to take
COUNSELOR
That’s really up to you You need
to set your own pace

Everybody stares Elton is clearly uncomfortable

ELTON
Right then I know how this goes
My name is Elton John
And I’m an alcoholic
And a cocaine addict
And a sex addict
And a bulimic I’m also a
shopaholic who has problems with
weed prescription drugs and anger
management

The group look at him incredulously Elton blinks angrily
behind his enormous glasses An awkward silence

COUNSELOR
Perhaps we should talk about your
childhood

ELTON
Perhaps we should talk about your
hair

Some of the group are shocked and some laugh The counselor
smiles

COUNSELOR
What are your earliest memories

Cue The frantic opening from ‘THE BITCH IS BACK’ Elton gets
up and walks to the middle of the room and sings
Blue Rev White Shooting 2

ELTON
I was justified when I was five
Raisin’ Cain I spit in your eye
Times are a changing now the poor
get fat But the fever’s gonna
catch you when the bitch gets back
oh oh oh

The patients and counselor are dumbfounded as out of nowhere
a child (REGGIE) 6 years old rides in through the double
doors on a bike with stabilizers and circles Elton The young
Reggie stops and stares at Elton and joins in the song

ELTONREGGIE
I’m a bitch I’m a bitch oh the
bitch is back stone cold sober as
a matter of fact I can bitch I
can bitch cause I’m better than
you It’s the way that I move the
things that I do oh

A shocked Elton tries to grab Reggie as he dumps his bike and
runs out the door A singing Elton chases after him the
therapy group and counselor follow behind

EXT STREET PINNER - DAY 3

Young Reggie bursts through the doors and enters a 1950s
London residential street Reggie walks down the middle of
the street followed by Elton and the rehab group The
milkman postman and lollipop lady all wave to him A brass
band come marching down the street and they all smile and
wave People stream out of the houses and join in the group
dance The rehab group lead by Elton follow and sing along

ELTONREGGIE
Eat meat on a Friday that’s all
right Even like steak on a
Saturday night I can bitch the
best at your social do’s I get
high in the evening sniffing pots
of glue oh oh oh

It becomes a dance number that Reggie conducts with the rehab
group and the people in the street Reggie turns into the
driveway of a drab house turns back to the rehab group
looking over the fence

REGGIE
I’m a bitch I’m a bitch oh the
bitch is back Stone cold sober as
a matter of fact

INT BACK ROOM REGGIE’S HOUSE - DAY 4

An archetypal suburban scene IVY grandma in the kitchen
works on a sewing machine A depressed budgie lolls in its
cage Sheila attacks a carpet with the mechanical sweeper
like she’s trying to break it Reggie follows her around

REGGIE
Is he back

SHEILA
What am I Thin air

REGGIE
Are you sure he’s actually coming
home

SHEILA
I wouldn’t get your hopes up He’s
very unreliable and very selfish

REGGIE
But will you send him to see me if
I’m already in bed

SHEILA
Reggie Stop being a nuisance I
need to get this done before I go
out

She picks him up and puts him on the piano stool The radio
plays The Skater’s Waltz

As dust hangs in the sunlight Reggie sways to the music and
looks at the piano keyboard As it lilts on in the background
Reggie tries a note - remarkably it is in tune
White Shooting 4

Reggie plays the note again and then adds two more Again
they are exactly in tune He looks around No one pays
attention

Reggie tries again and this time plays a whole section of
melody and ends with a low note with his left hand Bong
Suddenly the world seems to stop The budgie stares frozen on
its perch boggle eyed Ivy comes in from the Kitchen Sheila
turns around to see what all the fuss is about

REGGIE
Did I do something wrong

IVY
Bloody hell Sheila Maybe we
should get him some lessons

SHEILA
Id love too if it’d get him out
from under my feet but we’re not
made of money

Reggie runs out

INT REGGIE’S BEDROOM REGGIE’S HOUSE - NIGHT 16

The door closes Reggie sits in the darkness After a moment
a torch comes on and Reggie slowly mimes playing the piano

Blue Rev White Shooting 8

As he becomes more animated the sound of Tchaikovsky Piano
concerto No1 accompanies him

He stands and points with his torch like a conductor to bring
in a string section The shafts of the light wave over the
room and we catch glimpses of the orchestra

We hear strings brass and woodwind join - as Reggie
conducts The whole orchestra plays Suddenly the door opens
and the light goes on Reggie freezes and looks up
terrified It’s Ivy She has 2 cakes

IVY
Take no notice These will make you
feel better

She kisses him and goes out Reggie takes a bite of the cake
then raises his hands to start the orchestra again as we cut
to

There is tension and mistrust in the air

STANLEY

interest in me and this family

“It’s getting late have you seen my

As somebody turns to watch Reggie they knock over a woman’s
beer and it spills down the front of a big bloke He turns
and pushes the wrong person which starts a small shoving
match and a fight breaks out Someone bumps into Fred and he
turns round and whacks them then turns back to Sheila and
puts his arm around her as if nothing has happened Reggie
watches as he plays and gets excited by the atmosphere As
the fight builds so does his playing and energy He grows
into a solid and exciting performer and his singing starts to
push the energy of the fight People fly across the room
glasses are smashed chairs are thrown Reggie sings on

“Ma tell me when the boys get back
here It’s seven o’clock and I want

avoid being hit but plays without missing a beat

“So don’t give us none of your

use of your talent

don’t work out Can you make any
money playing this kind of music
There’s no stability in it I like
rocknroll to but I wouldn’t
gamble my whole future on it I
cant allow it

song to Elton but Elton’s emotional singing is directly to

And now ladies and gentlemen a
rising star of Rock and Roll all
the way From London England
Please welcome Elton John

Small applause We follow Elton in slow motion as he goes on
stage He looks out at the audience they seem a vast blur He
sits at the piano but freezes A few people at the front look
at him but his eye moves to people who chat at the bar He
hears the glasses clink and the hot girls and boys who chat
oblivious to him He sits at the piano The room goes quiet
We can hear him breathe and his heart pound Suddenly he
kicks the piano stool off the stage and launches into
‘CROCODILE ROCK’

ELTON
I remember when I was young Me and
Suzie had so much fun Holding
hands and skimming stones

White Shooting 50

ELTON (CONTD)
Had an old gold Chevy and a place
of my own But the biggest kick I
ever got Was doing a thing called
the Crocodile rock While the other
kids were rocking round the clock
We were hopping and bopping to the
Crocodile Rock

Elton leaps about as he plays with electrifying abandon The
‘hot girls’ look on in wonder - Bernie slides up to them
Elton gives the performance of a lifetime

ELTON (CONTD)
Well Crocodile rocking is something
shocking When your feet just can’t
keep still I never knew me a
better time and I guess I never
will Oh Lawdy mama those Friday
nights When Suzie wore her dresses
tight And the Crocodile rocking
was out of sight

Elton and the piano slowly rise off the ground He is
suspended in the air by two feet as he plays The audience
starts to rise up as well Everyone joins in

ELTONEVERYONE
La lalalala la lalalala la lalala

The whole energy and power of the music and performance is
lifting everyone up and everything into the air People are
suspended and enthralled at what they are witnessing and
Elton plays on unaware of the affect his show is having He
is lost in the moment He repeats a phrase again and again
the whole club floats up as one He encourages them to join
in and drives the crowd to wilder and wilder appreciation
Finally he ends on a huge note and they all hang suspended
in time and mid air in silence For a split second he looks
out to the stunned air born crowd He sees Bernie who has a
huge grin on his face The audience are elated and stunned
and all smile at him

ELTON
Good grief

Elton smiles back then suddenly he remembers where he is and
everyone drops back down to the ground and spontaneously
burst into a huge cheer and applause

Intro ‘HONKEY CAT’

John Reid becomes Elton’s manager and leads him on a ‘dance
journey’ of discovery Introducing him to all the finer
things in life At each stage they accumulate expensive
possessions

All executed in a Hollywood 194050’s Musical dance style

They enter the ballroom and join other dancers Reid swings
Elton into a tailors dressing room

ELTON
When I look back boy I must have
been green Bopping in the country
fishing in a stream Looking for an
answer trying to find a sign
Until I saw your city lights
honey I was blind

A swarm of designers gather around him with colourful bolts
of cloth sequined jackets crazy hats They swirl around him
and he eventually emerges from the colour transformed in his
new attire Reid looks on approvingly

REID
They said get back honky cat
Better get back to the woods
Well I quit those days and my
redneck ways And oh the change
is gonna do me good

Then they dance over to a restaurant table Waiters make a
fuss setting the table napkins champagne and caviar
served

ELTON
You better get back honky cat
Living in the city aint where its
at Its like trying to find gold
in a silver mine Its like trying
to drink whiskey from a bottle of
wine

A car horn sounds and a convertible Rolls Royce pulls up As
they jump in the back back projection kicks in to reveal the
French Riviera mountain roads They stop at the top of a

Staircase as they walk dance down the stairs Jewelers
surround them ( Like Monroe in Diamonds) they drape them in
watches rings diamond necklaces etc

Well I read some books and I read
some magazinesAbout those high-
class ladies down in New Orleans
And all the folks back home well

rule

At the bottom of the stairs a shop window full of adverts for
Large Mansion houses Reid appears with a house brochure
shows it to Elton Reid opens his briefcase takes out a gold
pen and cheque book with a flourish he writes and hands it
to estate agent Elton and Reid walk off happy

But how can you stay when your
heart says no How can you stop
when your feet say go

The Artwork is rolled away to reveal a Caribbean beach with
young men and woman drinking cocktails and playing beachball
Reid and Elton strip down to their bathing suits and join in

A Pair of plane steps appear they run up them and appear
inside a beautifully furnished private plane with a piano and
bar in the middle They exit the plane and find them selves

Sure plays a mean pinball

We enter Elton ‘Pinball world’ A giant pinball machine of
tours and making huge amounts of money Reid plays Elton as
the ball and Elton is blindly bounced and buffered from one
concert to another From another country to another spending
spree People rush and pull him Elton is under the glass of
the machine and keeps moving and being played He goes down
different holes and pops out at a new gig Reid sings too as
he plays laughs and grins away

He stands like a statue Becomes
part of the machine Feeling all

know What makes him so good

lovers all die horribly and he did
so much and I’ve done nothing It’s
