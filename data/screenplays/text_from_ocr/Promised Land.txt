INT ORNATE RESTAURANT NYC - DAY 1

We open on a mirror in a beautiful ornate bathroom
Suddenly a man comes up from below frame with water dripping
off his face A bathroom attendant leans in and turns the
faucet off for him as he hands him a towel The man says
“Thank you” This is STEVE BUTLER A man in his late 30s
handsome and reminiscent of a guy you went to college with
As he dries his face he looks at himself After a long beat
he takes a deep breath And walks out into

An enormous beautiful main room of a restaurant We follow
Steve as he walks through the restaurant that drips with gold
leaf and marble As we take in this almost surreal room
the title card comes up across the screen

PROMISED LAND

We follow the man as he finally arrives at his table There
a man sits checking his blackberry This is David Churchill
a man in his early 50’s and the CFO of Global Crosspower
Solutions one of the largest energy corporations in the
country An impeccably dressed waitress comes to the table
behind Steve

WAITRESS
Can I get either of you gentlemen
anything else

DAVID
You want another drink

STEVE
I’m fine thanks

DAVID
(To waitress)
We’ll have another bottle of the
Chateau Margaux

Waitress leaves

DAVID
Youll be fine

David checks his watch

DAVID
Listen I’m sorry Michael isn’t
here yet His plane was delayed
getting into Teterboro

STEVE
Oh that’s no problem
DAVID
He likes to meet every executive
candidate it’s kind of a
tradition or a neuroses

STEVE
Well that’s nice of him

DAVID
It is actually Until he does his
one joke “I thought you said he
wasn’t handsome”

Steve laughs

DAVID
An oldie but a goodie

The waitress comes back with the bottle of wine and shows
David the label He nods

DAVID
What time you heading out tomorrow

STEVE
Well Sue’s already there I was
actually going to catch the last
bus tonight Be there to get
started first thing tomorrow
morning

DAVID
Sue Thomason right Jesus That
was the first thing they said about
you two You don’t stop

STEVE
Well I don’t know about that
DAVID
I do It’s why we’re talking right
now
DAVID
(Tastes wine To waitress)
Great (to Steve as she pours)

When we called the office out West
you were the only name they gave
us

STEVE
Well that’s really nice

Waitress exits
This lands

DAVID
Listen Steve this is a 9 billion
dollar company If someone is
recommending you It’s not nice
it’s numbers

STEVE
I appreciate that

DAVID
You are the only person from the
field we’re interviewing

on Steve

DAVID
Let me ask you something You guys
have closed more towns than the
team behind you by triple digits
And your total price point on what
we pay out on your leases is almost
half of everyone else’s How do
you do that

STEVE
I mean I grew up in Eldridge
Iowa

DAVID
- Meaning

STEVE
It might as well have been Rifle
Colorado Dish Texas or Lafayette
Louisiana Any of the places we’ve
sold They know me And I know
them

DAVID
Well unfortunately it seems the
rest of our road teams don’t see it
as quite so easy

STEVE
I grew up in a large farming
community (He rolls his eyes)
Football Fridays tractor pulls
cow tipping all of it

David smiles
STEVE
I was also one of two in my
graduating class who went to
college-- well who decided to
pursue something other than
agriculture Biggest fight my
grandfather and I ever had

DAVID
There’s just a pride I guess

STEVE
It’s delusional self mythologizing
And it’s bullshit We hada
Caterpillar plant down in Davenport
a few miles away

David nods

STEVE
My junior year in high school they
closed it down I remember
thinking nothing of it By the
time prom came around I got to see
first hand just how little legs we
had to stand on The whole farming
town fantasy was shattered And
what became real clear was that
without that plant without that
industry We had nothing And the
town was just

David is nodding

STEVE
I’m not selling them Natural Gas
I’m selling them their only way to
get back

DAVID
- Well that brings me to my
second question which is why the
hell would we take you off the
road

Steve laughs David looks behind Steve and notices
something He raises his glass

DAVID
(To Steve)
Best of luck Steve

They cheers Suddenly from behind Steve
VOICE
Is this the guy

A man in his 50’s walks up to the table This is Michael
Downey the obvious CEO of Global

MICHAEL
I thought you said he wasn’t
handsome

Steve smiles Michael sits down in the booth

MICHAEL
Sorry I’m late Had to stop at
home on my way My 11 year
daughter dissected a frog in
science class today She will not
stop crying

All the men chuckle

MICHAEL
11 years old can you believe it
Is that too young I didn’t
dissect a frog until senior year in
high school I mean is that even
necessary

The men acknowledge that’s true

MICHAEL
(To David)
Ah what are ya’ gonna do

After moment David turns to Steve Now both men look at
Steve Was this a legitimate question In a fraction of a
second

STEVE
It’s absolutely necessary It’s
the pursuit of knowledge Sure
the frog is sacrificed But in
the name of progress If your
daughter doesn’t dissect a frog
how will she ever learn to perform
a triple bypass

Beat

STEVE
Her tears notwithstanding this has
to happen whether she understands
it or not

(MORE)
STEVE (CONTD)
Like getting a vaccine your kid
might cry a second from the jab
but she ain’t gonna die of polio

Beat

STEVE
Tell her the good news is it gets
easier

After a beat Michael smiles

BEGIN CREDITS

EXT FARM - EARLY MORNING 2

In the first minutes of a cool Spring day we see a idyllic
landscape of a blood orange colored sky hanging above the
tree covered mountains of McKinley a small town at the foot
of a mountain In the distant foreground of this picturesque
still life we see two windows illuminated in a charming but
slightly run down farm house To the right and left of the
house we see seemingly unending land low lit to an almost
surreal color and covered in perfectly placed hay bales An
unusual sound can be heard a grunting

EXT FARMHOUSE - MORNING 3

A charming older woman in her 70s exits the squeaky screen
door carrying a cup of coffee She wears an apron and walks
with confidence By the barn we see a pick up truck
Suddenly a man in his late 70’s exits the barn He wears a
flannel shirt with sleeves rolled up and very lived in jeans
From the back of the truck he grabs an enormous bag of feed
with the ease of a sack of potatoes He immediately
disappears once again into the barn After a moment the
woman arrives outside the barn and waits As the man exits

MAN
Well any other horses and I’d
say that should last the rest of
the month

WOMAN

So well need more by Friday
MAN
(Smiling)
Sounds about right

The woman hands him the cup of coffee
MAN
Thank you

The woman smiles and pats the man on the back As he heads
to his truck

MAN
I’1l bring this one back

WOMAN
Oh yeah Bring the other five
while you’re at it

She holds up a powder blue mug

WOMAN
This is the only one I’ve got left

MAN
Yes ma’am

He gets into his truck and pulls away

EXT BUS - LATER

From up above we see the bus as it rolls through beautiful
farm land

INT BUS

Steve sits on a bus looking out the window at the pastoral
landscape as it passes by

INTEXT TRUCK - DRIVING - DAY 4

The man is drinking his coffee as the truck drives through
this incredibly beautiful farmland He waves out the window
to a couple of men standing in a pasture with a large number
of cattle

As the truck pulls up to an intersection and turns right we
see a very small church on the corner the slight
beginnings of a town center

Arriving to a stop light the truck pauses Then with the
audible flick of a green light the truck turns onto the top
of Main St the epicenter of this area In the low light of
the morning the small stretch is almost picturesque but as
the truck rumbles on we see the reality of the more modern
small town America
7A

Interspersed with the more common necessities like a coffee
shop and barber shop are a number of boarded up windows and
empty store fronts

The truck finally rumbles out of frame as we hold on the
exterior of a motel
EXT MOTEL - PARKING LOT - DAY 5

Steve exits from the motel and begins to walk across the
parking lot He is checking his blackberry He looks up as
we cut to

A woman in her 50’s standing in front of a very used Ford
Bronco This is SUE THOMASON She’s attractive put-together
and Steve’s leasing partner for the past 6 years But more
often then not she feels like his big sister She wears jeans
and a light sweater over a plaid shirt

STEVE
Good morning

SUE
Do I have to call you ‘Boss’ now

STEVE
Will you stop

Beat

STEVE
They’11 let me know

Sue smiles

STEVE
(referencing the car)
This is the best you could do

SUE
No But I wasn’t looking for the
best was I

STEVE
You know what I mean

He heads past her toward the driver’s side door

SUE
Stick

Steve immediately stops familiar with this moment and in
one motion is heading back around to the passenger side he
doesn’t drive stick shift

STEVE
You do it on purpose

SUE
Youre right I do boss
They get in In a wide shot we hear Sue try to start the
car It doesn’t turn over

STEVE (0S)
Worth it

The car starts
SUE
Suck it
INTEXT BRONCO - ROB’S GUNS GROCERY GUITARS AND GAS - DAY6

Sue and Steve are driving Steve looks at a map drinking a
bottle of water

SUE
Girl at the hotel said it’s right
around here Has everything

Steve looks up as Sue pulls into a small parking lot They
look up at the sign that says ‘Rob’s Guns Grocery Guitars
and Gas’ Sue reads aloud

STEVE
“Rob’s Guns Grocery Guitars and
Gas”

SUE

(marveling at the sign)
God I wish I thought of that
INT ROB’S GUNS GROCERY GUITARS AND GAS - DAY 7

Steve and Sue walk through to the back of a small local store
that seems like it might actually have everything

SUE
Where’d they put you up Four
Seasons

STEVE

The Pierre

SUE
Jesus

They keep walking Steve smiles

STEVE
And I was right this is the entry
point for the whole state

SUE
I love it Feels like dominoes

STEVE
It is

They arrive at a few racks of clothes and begin carefully
picking out clothes Sue grabs a few flannel shirts

STEVE
What season is this Do they even
still wear flannel now

SUE
Oh please up here they always
wear flannel

STEVE
« Or camo
SUE
I’m not wearing camo
STEVE
How was Houston How’s Danny
SUE
He’s 15 He’s gone but he

started baseball Made varsity

STEVE
As a freshman Sue that’s huge

SUE
I guess His first game is this
weekend and my missing it will go
to the top of the list of things
he’1l cover with his shrink at 45

STEVE
I’m sorry
SUE
Hey someone’s gotta pay for his

xbox
Steve picks up a pair of work gloves

STEVE
You need a new pair

SUE
I never use them

STEVE
That’s a yes Ok you ready

SUE
Boots

Steve looks down at his boots They are Caterpillar work
boots

STEVE
I’m not going over this again Sue
These are the best boots money can
buy and they’re made in America

Sue looks at him confused

SUE
Yeah but yours are old

Sue walks away to the check out counter which is actually a
gun case Steve follows Behind the counter is one rack of
larger guns and sure enough a rack of guitars

SUE
(Staring at the guitars)
Wow you really have them

The man behind the counter looks up from a book This is
ROB He is about 40 and in his black jeans collared shirt
and vest he doesn’t look like what you’d imagine a local to
look like

ROB
So I take it you’re not here to buy
a guitar

Sue smiles and looks for a credit card in her wallet

ROB
You’re the natural gas people

Sue is taken aback

SUE
I’m sorry

ROB
Apologizing right off the bat I
like it It’s endearing and
vulnerable and yet honest and
direct
11A

Sue doesn’t know what to say She almost looks back at Steve
but thinks better of it

ROB
(Pointing at her wallet)
The ID card is kind of a dead give

away
Beat
ROB
‘Bout time you all showed up
SUE
Yeah
ROB

Well hell yes What other choice
we got We can’t sell the scenery

SUE

Wow wanna come work for us
ROB

What and leave all this

He sarcastically gestures to his weird store Sue smiles

INTEXT BRONCO - DRIVING - DAY 8

Sue is driving They are both now wearing brand new clothes
Steve is drinking from a bottle of water

SUE
I can’t believe this so close to
the city Looks like Kentucky

STEVE
Two hours outside any city is
Kentucky You should know that

Sue notices a group of horses by the road

SUE
Hey Does something seem weird
about those horses

They both look out to the side of the road There are 6 or so
horses with long almost decorative manes

STEVE

No Not really

(squinting)
Wait Are they small

SUE
They seem very small Could they be
that small My eyesight’s going

STEVE
Maybe they’re ponies
SUE
(emphatically)
They’re not ponies
I mean I guess they could be
ponies
STEVE

Remember new region so we can go
as high as 5000 and 18 But it
doesn’t mean we have to

Beat The car is slowing down

SUE
Don’t ponies have big heads Like
proportionally

Sue pulls over to the side of the road She hands Steve a
clipboard with a complicated looking list of names addresses
and other figures He is checking his blackberry again He
hops out

EXT FARMHOUSE ROAD - DAY 9

We see the Bronco is parked at the base of a long dirt
driveway leading up to a rather dilapidated farmhouse The
Bronco and the house seem like mere specks in the middle of
the seemingly endless landscape around them

EXT FARMHOUSE - DAY 10

Steve walks up to the house where a young girl is pushing a
small toy lawn mower out front

STEVE
Hello there Are you the owner of
this place

GIRL
No sir

STEVE
No Well then how come you’re
doing all the work

GIRL
(Smiling)
I don’t know

STEVE
Well who do I talk to about that

The girl laughs and begins to lead him into the house

GIRL
My Dad

STEVE
Well alright then let’s go inside
and straighten all this out

Steve smiles and gently pats the girl’s head as the two walk
toward the stairs At the top a man opens the screen door
This is DREW SCOTT

DREW
Didn’t they already finish the
census

STEVE

No I’m not from the census I’m
from a Natural Gas company You
have a second

Steve and the girl get to the top of the steps
DREW
Oh hell Why didn’t you say so

Come on in

STEVE
Thank you

DREW
You just go shopping

Steve looks up at him Drew gestures to his neck
DREW
You got a tag stickin’ out of your

collar

He reaches over and yanks the tag from Steve’s collar

DREW
There ya go

STEVE
So much for looking local

As Steve crosses the threshold Drew looks down

DREW
Nice boots

Steve’s smile is bigger than it should be

STEVE
Thank you

INT CLAPBOARD HOUSE - DAY 11

Sue sits in a sparse living room with a woman in her late
20s She is naturally pretty and very sweet This is
CLAIRE ALLEN Suddenly a 10 year old comes by and sets down
2 glasses of red Hi-C for the woman and for Sue He is
wearing a t-shirt with YANKEES written in marker on the front
and the number ‘15’ written on the back along with his last
name ALLEN

CLAIRE
Thanks Carson

SUE
Thanks Wild color right (puts
the glass down without touching it
This does not go unnoticed by
Claire)
Sue points at Carsons watch

SUE
Is that Thor

CARSON
No it’s IRONMAN

He shows her

SUE
Oooh my son would love that

She pretends to take it Carson laughs

CARSON
Nooo

He walks away

CLAIRE
You have kids Ms Thomason
15A

SUE
(pulls out phone) Yes I do Danny
15 and ornery

CLAIRE
He looks sweet

SUE
Yours is sweeter

The two women laugh Carson re-enters

SUE
Mom can I play xbox

CLAIRE
Just for a bit And only because
youre going outside for baseball
in an hour

CARSON
Sweet

CLAIRE
(For Sue’s benefit)
Sorry about that I know I
shouldnt let him

SUE
Are you kidding Of course From
the minute we meet them and see
their little squishy faces wed do
anything for em Anything

Carson nods and leaves Claire turns back to Sue We can
see Carson in the background playing Xbox for the rest of the
scene

12 INT FARMHOUSE - DAY 12

Steve now sits at the kitchen table with DREW His daughter
is coloring at the table as well

DREW
Oh man have we been waiting on
you

STEVE
Oh yeah

DREW

It’s unbelievable I was just
reading in the paper THIS MORNING
about all that gas drillin’ goin’
on in Pennsylvania

He looks at the paper

DREW
This your outfit ‘Stanton Gas’

Steve glances over casually

STEVE
No there are a bunch of companies
We’re with ‘Global Crosspower
Solutions’

DREW
Well you guys are probably the
best

STEVE
You wanna come work for us

The two men laugh

13 INT CLAPBOARD HOUSE - DAY 13

Sue sits with Claire
SUE
Here’s the thing Claire And it’s
important that you know this
The initial phase of development
for drilling is ALSO the initial
phase of the town’s tax revenue
Which means money will be injected
into the town and its
infrastructure immediately

CLAIRE
That sounds impressive

SUE

I know a lot of fancy words But
here’s what it means to me The
number one reason I chose to live
where I do is for the school that
my boy goes to I just want what
most parents want for their kids
Everything And that everything
starts with his education

CLAIRE
You sound like a good mother

SUE
Far from good Honest maybe Do
you think your towns school system
is underfunded

CLAIRE
Yes

SUE
In a school system like yours the
chances of Carson going to college
are too low And in todays
market without a college degree
the only jobs available are manual
labor and those jobs are
going if not gone TECHNOLOGY
is our sons future

CLAIRE
Yes We tried to get a computer
system for the kids last year but
it never happened

17A

SUE
Well theres no reason why your
town shouldnt have a state of the
art high school and your son
guaranteed an education that allows
him to compete on the highest
level Hell have a chance

Beat This registers with Claire

14 INT FARMHOUSE - DAY 14

Steve and Drew at the kitchen table

STEVE

Our leases start at 2000
DREW

Wait that’s it
STEVE

That’s right

DREW
Well that’s not necessarily life
changing money is it

STEVE
Per acre And you have 20 Now
there are a lot of people around
here that would say 40000 well
that’s pretty good money
Especially for doing nothing

Drew wipes sweat off his face Looks at Steve

STEVE
But the real reason I’m here in
this early stage is because our
research shows that your particular
plot of land has a potentially
“high yield” That means that not
only the size of the deposit but
the quality of the shale is in the
top tier

Drew as if watching a thriller movie

DREW
Mm Hm

STEVE
Now we at Global don’t want to be
tenants We want to be partners
That’s why we offer an 12 and a
half percent share in any and all
profits we see from your wells

DREW
And with this this top tier
level of shit what kind of figures
are we looking at

STEVE
Well it’s hard to tell until we
get down there but--

DREW
Ballpark man Like other people
who have had a similar situation

Beat
STEVE
Millions
DREW
Wait What do you mean Like you
guys uh
STEVE
You Could be A
millionaire
Drews look is elated Scared Dead
INT DINER - DAY 15

Steve walks into the nearly empty diner that looks like a
time capsule He sees a man wave his hand and joins him in a
vinyl booth in the back The man is GERRY RICHARDS he’s
about 60 years old and one of McKinley’s three town
supervisors Steve introduces himself and sits down

STEVE
Supervisor Richards Steve Butler

RICHARDS
Call me Gerry for God’s sake

A waitress comes over to the table and drops 2 menus

WAITRESS
Anything to drink

RICHARDS
Steve
STEVE
I’ll have a cup of coffee

WAITRESS
And you sir

RICHARDS
I’m fine thanks

She exits

RICHARDS
Well listen I appreciate you
sitting down with me here I know
youre busy so I just thought it
might be nice to meet before the
town hall tomorrow so we can get to
know each other a little bit

STEVE
Of course Listen as the most
senior member of the supervisors
board thank YOU for sitting down
with ME Appreciate it

Richards laughs

RICHARDS
It’s exciting all this natural gas
stuff

STEVE

It is Very exciting

RICHARDS
(Leans in and whispers
with a smile)
A whole lot of money down there

Steve laughs

STEVE
That’s also true yes

RICHARDS
How much do you think (He
gestures) How much money we got
down there
Beat

STEVE
Well our research department
hasn’t finished their analysis yet
but I’d say somewhere between 15 or
20 million dollars

RICHARDS
Is that right

STEVE
Could be

Lynn returns with a cup of coffee and a creamers

RICHARDS
So I’ve been doing a little
research about all this gone
online a little bit And well
I’ve read all these rumblings of
Natural Gas possibly contaminating
water sources Killing crops and
what not

STEVE
I understand your concern I’ve
read all those stories myself And
let me assure you--

RICHARDS
People lighting their water on
fire People getting sick That
sounds nasty

STEVE
These are just scare tactics--

RICHARDS
I have a responsibility to protect
these people To ensure their
safety And well to be honest
I’m just not sure I’m too
comfortable telling my constituents
to allow you folks into our town
No matter how much money you have

STEVE
Mr Richards--

RICHARDS
There’s a lot of people counting on
me Steve and not just in this

town
(MORE )

RICHARDS (CONTD)
People look to me in the next town
and the next town You see I have
the opportunity to set a precedent
here

STEVE
Look there are answers to
everything you just brought up--

RICHARDS
Now I know you all have quite an
operation in the works here
Plans to set up all throughout the
state I’d hate to be the guy to
jeopardize all that for you

Steve looks up Richards is looking directly at him He has
a smile on his face a different smile

RICHARDS
To lead this one little “podunk”
town to reject your company To
reject natural Gas I mean I can’t
even imagine what that would mean
for you guys (Richards changes)
And if that story got around In
the papers On the news Can you
imagine What that would do to
your balance sheet

There’s a long beat Both men stare each other down

STEVE
It’s 30000

RICHARDS
What’s that

STEVE
We can offer you 30000 dollars

The waitress comes back to the table

WAITRESS
Can I get you anything else

RICHARDS
(Without breaking his
stare at Steve)
You know what Lynn I think we’re
done here Just the check please

She exits Richards grabs his jacket Then he pulls out a
small note pad
RICHARDS
(Reading)
The Marcellus shale Estimated at
2 TRILLION dollars With BILLIONS
in potential tax revenue to
individual states

Back to Steve

RICHARDS
Google First one that came up
First sentence Now do you wanna

re-think that joke number you
mentioned earlier

STEVE
Mr Richards I’m just being
straight with you here It’s
simple math Best case scenario
there’s 30 million dollars under
your town 1 of that is 30000
dollars They want me to offer as
low as 10 in these situations
But you seem like a smart guy so
I’m telling you we have 30

Richards reaches for his jacket Steve sips coffee

STEVE
- But I’m also telling you this
is a one time offer

Richard stops and looks at Steve

STEVE
Don’t do this I’ve been here
before and it doesn’t end well
You don’t wanna be last You’re
right we have teams in place in
towns all over this state and
the next state And the next
state We’re all the way up to
Maine now And every one of those
towns are signing fast

Richards smiles saying nothing

STEVE
Look I don’t fault you for trying
But I’m telling you-- hell I’m
begging you Don’t do this
Because the truth is we will walk
away We always do

(MORE )

STEVE (CONTD)
And then after every single town
within 3 states has signed up and
the blows of this economy are
almost unbearable we’ll come
back And well offer you nothing
Well offer this town nothing
Every lease we’ve signed every
piece of the pie we’ve offered It
all goes away and we buy this
place for nothing

Richards’ face has changed

STEVE
Let some other guy be last

The waitress comes back to the table with the check He
hands her a 20 dollar bill

STEVE
Thank you

Steve stands up

STEVE
So I’1l see you tomorrow

RICHARDS
I’1l see you tomorrow

Steve exits leaving Richards there to contemplate what
couldve just happened

INT MOTEL - HALLWAY - DAY 16

Sue and Steve walk down the hallway Steve is once again
checking his blackberry Sue stops at a door and opens it

SUE
Nice job today

STEVE
Thanks

SUE

Kind of anti-climactic I thought
it’d harder This one’s easy

STEVE
They always are
SUE
Well good let’s wrap this up and
get the hell out of here early
Maybe I can fly home for the
weekend game before we head
upstate

24A

Steve is still looking at his blackberry Suddenly he
freezes Sue notices

SUE
What

Long beat He turns back to her

STEVE
(quietly)
I got it

Sue smiles After possibly a moment too long she walks over
and gives him a hug With her face over his shoulder we can
now see her conflict

SUE
- That’s great

She gives him a motherly kiss on the cheek Then sniffles
and turns back to her door so Steve doesn’t see her tears

SUE
I’m proud of you
STEVE
Sue
She turns back
STEVE

Buy the plane ticket tonight I’11
even pay for it

SUE
Cocky bastard

She goes into her room

Steve turns and walks down the hallway As the news finally
sinks in he smiles huge

Music begins to play as we

INT BUDDYS - NIGHT 17

Welcome to ‘Buddys’ the center of social life in McKinley
It’s warm and welcoming a cross between hunting lodge and
dive bar There’s a long bar and an adjacent dining area U-
shaped around a small stage About a dozen animals mostly
deer and moose are mounted on the wall The place is full of
beer signs and photos of locals with big catches and hunters
with one foot on dead 10-point bucks

Steve is at the bar drinking a scotch Next to him is his
plastic bottle of water The bartender an enormous man in
his 60’s who is obviously the leader of a motorcycle gang
pours him another scotch from a very dusty bottle

BARTENDER
You want me to leave the bottle

STEVE
Uh yeah sure Thanks

He takes a sip

WOMAN (0C)
Three more Jesse

BARTENDER
Well goddamn

Steve turns to see a young woman at the bar

WOMAN
Don’t judge me Jesse it’s my
birthday

BARTENDER

I didn’t say nothin’

This is ALICE There’s a part of her that’s likely still the
Girl Next Door but the part we meet is a bit rough around
the edges She’s pretty without trying and she knows it It
is her birthday a fact that is quite apparent from how tipsy
she is

Alice looks over and sees Steve looking at her He
immediately turns away

ALICE
Lemme guess 40 Marketing
Married 2 kids
Steve doesn’t look up
STEVE
38 StripperWaitress but was

“born” to be a singer

ALICE
Hey asshole I’m a teacher

Steve finally turns to her for the first time

I was talking about me

Alice wants to laugh but doesn’t

ALICE
Youre a waitress

STEVE
Times are tough

Beat Without taking his eyes off of her
STEVE
Do you want a dance 100 bucks per
song

Alice finally laughs

ALICE
That’s insane I wouldn’t pay 30

Steve still not giving in

STEVE
You haven’t seen my moves

ALICE
Ok now you’re creeping me out

Steve finally laughs Reaches to shake her hand

STEVE

Jesse brings back 3 Budweiser bottles and 3 Jack Daniels
shots

ALICE
It’s my birthday
STEVE
Really
ALICE

Really Well tomorrow
Steve smiles

STEVE
Do they give you the day off for
your birthday Or do you just tell
the kids you’ve got a stomach bug

ALICE
First off I resent the implication
that I can’t hold my liquor And
secondly the first two periods
we watch videos

STEVE
AH
ALICE
So
STEVE
So what
ALICE
What brings you to our booming
metropolis
STEVE

Well I’m from a small town myself
so it feels a lot like home

ALICE
Oh yeah Where’s that
STEVE
Eldridge Iowa
ALICE
Ah youre a buckeye
STEVE
That’s Ohio actually
ALICE
Same thing
STEVE

Ok

GROUP
Alice let’s go

Steve looks over to see three girls at a table against the

wall

They are Alice’s friends the one yelling is GWEN

full-figured and loud -- she thinks she’s Bette Midler

From off camera we hear a group of girls yell
STEVE
Well it was nice meeting you

ALICE
You even gonna buy a girl a
birthday drink

STEVE
That would communicate the wrong
thing

ALICE

(smiling)
You’re an asshole

STEVE

Of course I’1l1 buy your drinks
ALICE

Absolutely not you lost your

chance

Gwen yells again from the table As Alice looks Steve

stares at her and smiles

GWEN
What are we doin’ We drinkin’ or
not

Alice looks back at Steve

ALICE
How long you in town

STEVE
Uhh-- a bit I’m gonna be around
for a bit

ALICE
You’re gonna be “Around for a bit”
- You’re a terrible liar

STEVE
I’m not lying

Alice smiles skeptical
ALICE
Well you wanna give a girl a real

birthday gift

Steve smiles Seems a little forward but hey

STEVE
Sure

Alice doesn’t break eye contact with Steve After a beat

ALICE
Jesse were playing ABSOLUT
MADNESS

Steve still smiling is confused

STEVE
What’s ABSOLUT MADNESS

ALICE
It’s pretty much what it sounds
like You and Jesse both drink 5
shots in 5 minutes and if you can
get closer to the bulls eye on that
dartboard we drink for free and you
get your Polaroid on the wall

She points behind the bar to a line of Polaroids of men
completely annihilated

STEVE
That’s not at all what it sounds
like I’m in
Jesse begins setting up shot glasses And slams down a
bottle of Absolut vodka Other people in the bar start
gathering to watch Steve notices
STEVE
How bout this We drink 8 shots in
8 minutes and EVERYONE here drinks
for free
Jesse looks to Alice concerned She laughs knowingly

ALICE
Sure

Every one cheers Jesse shakes his head

ALICE
Good luck

As the men grab their first shots and cheers each other we

CUT TO

INT HOUSE - MORNING 18

Steve is dead asleep on a couch that is too small for him He
is covered in what looks like a hand made blanket He is
jarred awake by nothing

He takes in his surroundings All of a sudden we see Alice
sitting at a small table She is completely dressed and ready
for the day She drinks a cup of coffee as she reads the
morning paper online

ALICE
Oh thank God you’re still pretty
handsome

He stares at her for a moment putting the pieces of his head
back together

ALICE
You’re late

STEVE
What

ALICE

Your phone hasn’t stop buzzing for
the last half hour

Steve checks his phone Sees the missed calls and more
importantly he sees the time He is very late

STEVE
SHIT

He immediately jumps up that wasn’t a good idea He
flinches for a split second Then begins quickly getting
dressed (He is wearing the same shirt but just boxers)

STEVE

Listen I had a really great time
ALICE

Did you
STEVE

Well I just mean--

ALICE
Nothing happened Steve

Beat Steve is confused
ALICE
Well actually you did kiss me just
before you threw up the first time

STEVE
Oh my God I’m really sorry Thank
you for letting me stay

ALICE
It’s fine I was gonna let you
sleep in your car but you couldn’t
remember which one was yours

STEVE
I didn’t drive

Beat
ALICE
Well then it’s a good thing I

didn’t let you sleep in your car

Steve is now basically dressed A dreaded part of the
morning

STEVE
So can I take your number
ALICE
You’re gonna be “around for a bit”
right
STEVE
Uh---
ALICE

It’s not that big a town You’ll
see me again

Steve is still putting everything together

STEVE
O-- Ok Is the-- Is the door--

ALICE
At the front of the house When you
get to it you’ll find a knob Turn
the knob and --

STEVE
Oh god Too early for that

Beat

STEVE
Well Thanks

ALICE
Your welcome

In a daze Steve goes to leave Then comes back again

STEVE
Hey happy birthday

He leaves Alice smiles

EXT MOTEL - DAY 19
Sue in the car is in the foreground talking on the phone

Out the driver side window we see a tiny blurry figure that
we are not paying attention to As Sue continues to talk on
the phone the blurry figure gets closer and closer then
stops is it bending over to catch his breath Or
retching

SUE
What’s wrong Because you called
me 3 times What What do you
mean you were burned Why were
you using an iron He asked
YOU to do it Fantastic I
highly doubt it’s burned OFF
Danny What did the nurse say
Throwing hand or catching hand So
can you play this weekend What you
mean pitch When did the coach say
that Danny that’s AMAZING

Finally the blur continues to come closer until he is right
up at the window exhausted and nauseous It’s Steve
Instinctually Sue slowly turns her head and stares at him
Steve pops up Through the glass we hear

STEVE
5 minutes

He pauses taking one more second to recover Then runs out
of frame

SUE
No no I’m just at work Hey
guess what I’1l1 be there I
booked it last night Hello
Danny can you hear me I’m
losing you

She hangs up

EXT HIGH SCHOOL GYMNASIUM - DAY 20

People file into a large high school gymnasium

INT HIGH SCHOOL GYMNASIUM - DAY 21

At half court there are 3 people sitting in folding chairs
the town supervisors In the bleachers facing them are about
400 people finding seats Supervisor Richards is standing in
front of the crowd He briefly looks over by the door to the
side of the bleachers where tucked away just out of view
Steve and Sue look on Steve holds a bottle of water

A man is whispering in Richards ear Richards acknowledges
and speaks

RICHARDS
Ok if everyone could find a seat
well begin in a moment Thank
you

Steve is typing on his blackberry Sue looks at Richards and
drinks a lemonade

SUE
He all set

STEVE
Yeah he’s on board What is that

SUE
Lemonade

STEVE
Is it good

SUE
GREAT Fresh squeezed There’s a
kid selling it out there She’s
cleaning up You want one

STEVE
(Holding up bottle of
water)
No

People are still filing in by Sue and Steve Most of them
carry lemonades
SUE
How many do we have

STEVE
Signed 14 today So that’s 27
Think we’ll only need the one more
day

SUE
I still can’t believe that’s why
you were late this morning We got
back from dinner at 930

STEVE
She was very cool You’d like her

SUE
You don’t want to make statements
like that just yet Name

STEVE
Alice

SUE
Alice

Sue stops and looks over

SUE
-- Was she elderly

Steve shoots her a look as Richards begins to speak

RICHARDS
Ok I appreciate you all coming
today Unfortunately there seems
to have been a scheduling error so
well have to make this quick
Well this is quite a turn out
We’re not used to standing room
only I must be doing something
right

Richards gives a politician’s smile People murmur a
response

RICHARDS
Ok let’s get right to it Now I
know some of you have been hearing
dribs and drabs about all this
natural gas stuff Maybe some of
you even have family or friends who
have had natural gas come to their
town

(MORE)

RICHARDS (CONTD)
In which case I’m sure you’ve
heard then what a life changing
opportunity it is Creating
HUNDREDS of jobs and therefore
millions of dollars in revenue and
large injections of funding into
town infrastructure

Beat

RICHARDS
Well I am very happy to announce
that we will be bringing natural
gas to McKinley

There is a burst of applause Sue and Steve notice
Suddenly a voice bursts out from the crowd

VOICE
How do they get the gas

Everyone looks for the voice including Richards and Sue
Steve looks up for a brief second but finishes whatever e-
mail he’s working on

Richards spots the source of the voice This is FRANK YATES
He is about 70 years old but his level of physical
strength and calm strength of spirit is apparent
immediately We recognize him as the man who drove the truck
in the credit sequence

SUPERVISOR RICHARDS
Ah How are ya Frank If you
wouldnt mind just holding on for
one minute there’ll be time for
questions at the end Now the
company we’ll be working with is
called Global Crosspower Solutions
and--

FRANK
I apologize I was just wondering
how it all works that’s all

We can see members of the crowd now turning back to Richards
to hear his response Steve again looks up He is
completely confident in his new employee

SUPERVISOR RICHARDS
Well its a rather complex
process

Beat People wait for a response

SUPERVISOR RICHARDS
But I will uh explain it as
simply as I can There are uh
rock deposits underground Deep
under ground MILES underground
And what they do is create these
drills that go 2 or 3 miles down
and break up the rock shale
it’s called shale And that
breaking of the rock is what
actually releases the gas--

FRANK
Its called Fracking

SUPERVISOR RICHARDS
Excuse me

FRANK
The process Its called Fracking

SUPERVISOR RICHARDS
That’s right That’s right Now
Frank if you’d just let me finish
please I--

FRANK
I would encourage all of you to go
home and Google this word and see
what you find Unfortunately it’s
not nearly as simple as what
Supervisor Richards just laid out
Now listen it’s true there is
some money to be made having this
industry coming in but can we at
least not pretend that it is not
without cost

Without taking her eyes off Frank Sue hits Steve’s arm who
has finally looked up from his blackberry

STEVE
Justhold on

SUPERVISOR RICHARDS
Frank now I’m gonna have to ask
you to stop this This is
completely inappropriate And not
at all the forum to have this
conversation

FRANK
Gerry we’ve all known this was a
possibility And now it’s here
(MORE)

FRANK (CONTD)
So seems to me this is the ONLY
forum to have this conversation

Drew turns around from a row or two in front to talk to Frank
respectfully

DREW

Frank I’m sure we all appreciate
the point you’re trying to make
but there really isn’t any decision
here We need this

There are grumbles of support for Drew Frank looks around
and then slowly stands up Next to him his wife attempts to
keep him seated for a moment People stop to listen

FRANK
I’m sorry But this thing here
It may not be the saving grace you
all want it to be Now Gerry
started this thing by saying that
Natural Gas coming here is life
changing and it is It’sa
clean and efficient resource but
the way we go about getting it is
some dirty business

RICHARDS
With all due respect I think you’re
out of your league

Steve and Sue look on Richards tries to maintain control

FRANK
And the potential for error is just
too high and the results can be
both horrible and irreversible

RICHARDS
Thank you Frank

FRANK
There are reports from all over the
country of people’s water being
contaminated

SUE
No no no

FRANK
People who have to haul their own
water from miles away It’s harder
to get enough for your crops and
cattle-- Let alone to drink
RICHARDS
Ok Frank I’ve absolutely had
enough of this We don’t have to--

All of a sudden Steve steps out from behind the bleachers

Sue reaches to grab him

SUE
Steve--

STEVE
(cutting her off without
looking )
I’ve got this

SUE
Goddamn it

Steve arrives next to Richards completely calm

STEVE
Sorry I’m late Mr Richards What
did I miss

Everyone looks down to Steve he has never been so
in his career Steve looks up at Frank

STEVE
Oh I’m sorry I think I interrupted
you Mrrrrrrrr

FRANK
Yates My name is Frank Yates

STEVE
Oh Mr Yates are you connected
with an environmental group

Frank chuckles

FRANK
No
STEVE
Oh what line of work you in Sir
FRANK
I’m a teacher here at the high
school
STEVE

A teacher

public

FRANK
I teach science What about you
Mrrrrrrrr

A few people chuckle at Frank’s confident retort including
Steve

STEVE
My name is Steve Butler Ima
consultant here for Global
Crosspower Solutions

FRANK
Ah then you’re the man we have to
thank for all that money

STEVE
I wish No I’m just the guy that
works for the guy that works for
the guy that may have had something
to do with all that money

There are some laughs from the crowd

STEVE
I only heard the last part of what
you were saying but you sound like
a man that’s certainly done his
homework Where may I ask did you
get all your information

FRANK
Mr Butler you and I both know the
information I’m referring to is
vast and detailed

STEVE
Youre probably right And I’m
sure I’m not the guy who has all
the answers

FRANK
Oh then you’d be the perfect guy
for them to send to deny
everything

Beat Steve smiles and chuckles again

STEVE
Listen I’m not going to deny that
this issue has been made very
complicated by a number of
companies that have had their fair
share of incidents

(MORE)

STEVE (CONTD)
But natural gas is not a new
issue We’ve been drilling in
this country for over 50 years
And like any industry you evolve
My company alone has invested
millions and millions of dollars
Now why would we do that If we’re
this ‘evil machine’ that cares
about nothing but the bottom line
why would we invest in something
that is fatally flawed Because
instead of being one of the
companies that is working to make
the process “faster” we chose to
make it “right” For this exact
moment Because we knew if we
figured out how to do it right
wed be the only ones on the field

Frank smiles

Beat

FRANK
But Global is being sued Is that
right Steve By numerous parties
Dealing with this exact technology

STEVE
Sure we are Like any other
company our size in every other
industry And we stand up to those
people because we’re not in the
business of handing out free money
to people who make false claims
And we haven’t lost once

FRANK
Well you can’t lose a game that’s
still being played

FRANK
Look Mr Butler I’m sure even you
can admit that Fracking is far from
a perfect process

STEVE
Perfect (smiles) No maybe not
But with all the government
restrictions they put on us and
hoops we have to jump through it’s
pretty close to perfect

(MORE)

STEVE (CONTD)
Heck the only reason why natural
gas is so big right now is because
it’s finally the clean alternative
TO the incredibly dangerous
industries like coal and oil If
you know of another industry that’s
cleaner than this and can have this
big an impact on our country right
now please tell me cause I’1ll go
work there

Crowd smiles

FRANK
If it’s such an incredible
alternative why do they need a man
standing off to the side of the
room to make sure we all go for it
Seems like it should be able to
sell itself

Beat If Steve stutters for even a moment we can’t see it

FRANK
But you’re not the man with the
answers So who is Because I

still have questions

STEVE
I can certainly try

FRANK
Well good I have questions about
Fracking water where they put all
that water they shoot into the
ground when it comes back up That
is highly toxic stuff The air
pollution from the well tanks the
potential for ground water
contamination the deadly effect on
live stock and basically how would
we live here when this is all over

Steve still somehow appears unflappable hiding his all but
lost composure

STEVE
-- And I’m happy to answer all
those questions There’s no such
thing as a neutral position here
If you’re against natural gas
youre FOR coal and oil Unless we
talk about cutting our consumption

(MORE)

STEVE (CONTD)
And so far that’s a conversation
none of us are willing to have

Frank smiles There’s a long pause

FRANK
Steve I just came here to point
out that this issue is a bit more
complicated than it seems

STEVE
Well you’ve certainly done that
FRANK
Great so I think we should take a
vote
STEVE

Wait what

FRANK
In a few weeks once everyone has
had a chance to think this whole
thing through I think we should
put it to a vote

STEVE
But that’s not--

He turns to Richards confident this isn’t possible

RICHARDS
Oh for Gods sake Frank
unfortunately this isn’t an issue
that is in the realm of a town
vote

FRANK
Gerry the law states it is
completely within the board’s power
to relinquish any major decision to
the will of the people If they
so choose

The crowd starts grumbling seemingly with support for both
sides of the conversation

STEVE
Mr Yates with all do respect
I’ve talked to a lot of folks here
who really need this And I don’t
think anyone here is going to be
swayed by one man

FRANK
You’re right

Frank looks to the crowd There’s a long beat Suddenly as
if on cue a swell of people begin standing up At first
glance it would appear to be a majority of the crowd we
now know the reason for the big turnout

As they rise we see the rush of blood to Steve’s head Off
to the side Sue’s eyes are wide

FRANK
These people and I got together to
say we strongly believe that this
is NOT in the best interest of this
town

A man runs up to Richards and whispers in his ear This is
the coach of the high school basketball team We now see at
one of the doors of the gym the team has entered and are
standing off to the side ready for a practice

SUPERVISOR RICHARDS
Uh Yeah yeah sure thing
Stan Go ahead

The boys immediately flood into the gym and go into lay up
lines

Richards turns back and tries to compose himself

SUPERVISOR RICHARDS
Well this isn’t everybody Frank
You know not even half the town is
here today

FRANK
Exactly And I think all those
people would hate to be left out of
such a big decision

SUPERVISOR RICHARDS
Frank--

FRANK
Let’s face it Gerry money can
often lead to bad decisions
Youve seen the same numbers I have
and with the recent figures on the
deposits in this area at 150
million dollars let’s all take
some time to think it through

Richards looks over at Steve

SUPERVISOR RICHARDS
150 million dollars

FRANK
Those are the latest numbers out of
the university
Steve says nothing and that says everything This
registers like a freight train on Richards He’s been duped
and is immediately furious Staring straight at Steve
SUPERVISOR RICHARDS
Well 150 million dollars IS a lot
of money
Beat

SUPERVISOR RICHARDS
Let’s have a vote

Steve goes to say something

SUPERVISOR RICHARDS
Say three weeks We’re adjourned

Richards glares at Steve as he walks past him

SUPERVISOR RICHARDS
Asshole

Time seems to have slowed down for Steve who has no idea how
to process what happened in the last 3 minutes He looks
over at Sue who is furious

The basketball team immediately rushes out around Steve all
dribbling balls as people begin to file out

From up above we see Steve just standing there at half court
as he is completely surrounded By this basketball team
by this town

INTEXT BRONCO - DRIVING - DAY 22

Sue is behind the wheel driving furiously and fast

SUE
Holy shit

Beat

SUE
Holy SHIT
STEVE
Calm down Sue

SUE
Don’t tell me to calm down What
was that Stepping out on that
court What the hell were you
thinking

STEVE
I was trying to fix things

SUE
Bull SHIT You didn’t want to
lose You saw an old man beating
up on your newest investment and
you took that as some personal
slight to YOU He was just trying
to score points on a town official
until you played right into him and
handed him the whole game
“Natural gas isn’t perfect” What
were you thinking And what
happened with the politician
Why was he so pissed

STEVE
- I told him the number was 30
million

SUE
Jesus Christ Well once again
you came in below the price point
Was it worth it

STEVE
I’m sorry Sue

SUE
Steve I don’t give a shit about
your numbers or your promotion I
don’t My son is in fucking
Houston with his stupid fucking
dad I don’t give a shit about
being number one I’m here to do a
job and go home

STEVE
I’m sorry Sue

SUE
Stop with the fuckin’ sorries

SUE
the plan is the same But
starting now we sign EVERYONE I
don’t care if they have 100 acres
or 1 acre We go door to door and
we lease it all We don’t lose

Steve nods but is obviously rattled

SUE
Nothing’s changed They still need
the money

INT MOTEL - NIGHT 23

Sue and Steve are in Sue’s hotel room They are Skyping with
some people at the corporate offices We recognize the man
in the forefront as David Churchill the man Steve
interviewed with

DAVID

What are you telling us Are you
telling us that we could actually
LOSE this thing

STEVE
That won’t happen We just have to
move quickly

DAVID

Jesus Christ Do you have any idea
what happens if this vote doesn’t
go our way It’s like a goddamn
wildfire straight up the corridor
(Close to hysterical) If this gets

out the environmental groups get
into this Everything changes for
us

STEVE

I understand

DAVID

DO you Do you have any idea how
this will play at the shareholders
meeting It’ll be a blood bath

A goddamn blood bath We’re
sending the back up team now

We’ve just got to do an all out
push on this town

STEVE
Not a chance

SUE
With all due respect if you send
in more people from the company we
immediately look like we’re running
scared

DAVID
(Looking to try and see)
» Who is that

A voice off screen answers “Sue Thomason”

SUE
Steve and I can handle this

DAVID
Well we have to do SOMETHING
Jesus Christ What happened
Steve You were supposed to get
in get out Why the hell would
you step out there and expose the
whole goddamn thing

Beat Steve looks at the screen

STEVE
It was a judgement call I don’t
know I guess I thought--

SUE
Sir it’s obvious they had planned
this long in advance The
politician was buckling that’s
when Steve stepped in to try and
put out the fire This Yates guy
is just a wild card

STEVE
He’s the high school science
teacher

DAVID
Well we have him pulled up
online he’s a lot more than
that Frank Yates MA
engineering MIT PhD from Cornell
in Physics Jesus Christ the guy
worked R and D for Boeing for 32
years He retired Steve He’s
teaching for fun
48A

STEVE
I’1l handle this sir This was my
mistake It’s a setback Nothing
more-—

SUE
I can have this entire town
committed on paper before he can
get one more supporter

STEVE
Give me the chance

DAVID
Well we’ve got a lot to discuss
here Steve I don’t think I need
to tell you how important this
is this one’s all or nothing
We understand each other

STEVE
--I understand

The Skype clicks off immediately lessening the amount of
light coming from the screen With no other lights on Steve
and Sue just sit silently in the glow of the computer Sue
puts a hand on Steve’s shoulder

From the room we see Steve in the bathroom brushing his
teeth Takes a small sip of water from a small plastic hotel
cup and spits it out There’s one last sip and he drinks it

EXT MAIN STREET - MORNING 26
Steve walks down an oddly quiet main street He is obviously
in his own head We follow him for a long beat until he
comes to the Diner Without looking up he goes to open the
door As the door opens a wall of noise erupts from inside
INT DINER - MORNING 27

Steve enters and immediately looks up to see a bustling diner
buzzing with heated debate
49A

Steve walks up to the counter of the retro diner to wait for
coffee through a mob of 10 others shouting and arguing
various opinions and feelings about the potential new
industry He is taking it all in as he stands stunned at the
register Suddenly a voice

VOICE
Coffee handsome

Steve turns to see Lynn the waitress from his meeting with
Richards

STEVE
Uh two

LYNN
Cream and sugar

STEVE
Yeah thanks

Lynn hands him his coffees Steve goes to pay She touches
his hand

LYNN
No no these are on me Don’t you
worry about Frank Yates darlin’
We all know it’s not true

She winks Steve doesn’t know what to say

STEVE
Thanks

LYNN
Those folks can scream and shout
all they want they still need
money

Steve exits

EXT MAIN STREET - MORNING 28

As the diner door slowly closes behind Steve the sound fades
into a complete silence once again Steve walks along
collecting his thoughts

A car is parked at the lone stop light Steve looks up
casually and then looks again The man behind the wheel
looks at Steve smiling There is a logo on the side of his
car that reads ‘ATHENA’ As Steve gets across the street he
turns back to look again as the light changes and the car
drives on

Off Steve’s look

29 EXT MOTEL - PARKING LOT - MORNING 29

Sue stands leaning against the hood of the Bronco checking
her phone Steve walks up with the 2 coffees

STEVE
Hey did research say anything
about an environmental presence
SUE
None of the usual suspects
Nothing locally

STEVE
Huh

He hands her a coffee

warm smile

DUSTIN

Frank looks over

FRANK
Yes

Dustin walks in

DUSTIN
My name is Dustin Noble I’m from
an environmental group called

ATHENA
FRANK
What can I do for you
DUSTIN
Well I heard about the vote

And I’m here to help out in any way
I can

Frank smiles

FRANK
Look I don’t think anyone in this
town considers themselves to be
members of some kind of movement or
on the front lines of some great
environmental revolution I have
a feeling we can win this

Dustin smiles

Beat

DUSTIN
With all due respect sir you’ve
picked a much bigger fight than you
think so you have to win

DUSTIN
And I have the one thing you
don’t Evidence

Steve walks up a driveway just as he did before only this
time the house is noticeably smaller than the ones we’ve seen
before and the land much less expansive

Steve walks onto the rickety porch and stands in front of a
screen door He pauses and takes a deep breath then rings
the bell A 6 year old boy appears at the screen door

STEVE
Hey there are you the owner of
this place

(Smiling)
Noooo

toothpaste deodorant and a bunch of cans of soup and
Spaghetti O’s Rob looks up

ROB
There a storm coming I should know
about

SUE
Looks like we’re gonna be here for
a while

ROB

Not necessarily a bad thing

Sue smiles at him as he starts to bag her items Sue glances
over and is shocked to see one of the windows has been
shattered

SUE
What the hell happened

ROB
Ah I got into a bit of a heated
discussion last night at the bar
I’m assuming that’s not a
coincidence

SUE
A heated discussion About what

Rob looks at her to say “I think you know”

SUE
You gotta be kidding me

ROB
It’s no big deal Listen they all
need the money Some of them just
aren’t ready to admit it yet

Sue just looks at him
SUE

Steve is sitting in the truck playing with the radio He is
frustrated that there is no station Suddenly you can barely
make out a U2 song then immediately returns to the

aggressive sound of static

STEVE
Jesus (to the radio) Come ON

Suddenly Steve looks up and in the rear view mirror sees
Dustin filling his car with gas Dustin looks over at him
Steve gets out of the car just as Dustin finishes up

Excuse me

Dustin gets in his car

ALICE
The town hall Didn’t look like

STEVE
Yeah I’m sorry I lied to you
We were only supposed to be here 2-
3 days

ALICE

That’s ok We don’t actually play
a game called ABSOLUT MADNESS
Jesse’s shots were water

Right at that moment Jesse comes and sets the dusty bottle of
scotch in front of Steve He smiles at Steve Steve is
totally confused

STEVE
-What’s ABSOLUT MADNESS

Alice smiles at him knowingly Then hands him a napkin with
her number on it

ALICE
In case of emergency only

She gets up to leave

ALICE
See ya’ around Steve Oh and
congratulations you got your
picture on the wall

She leaves Steve stares at her smiling still confused
Just as he’s about to call out to her we hear a noise
It’s coming from the stage Steve quickly turns to see
Sue singing ‘I SAW THE LIGHT’ She sings the lst line
silence she sings the second It is not good but
determined Suddenly the bar begins to slowly clap only
politely Steve looks to Sue mouth agape

Sue finishes to mild applause She walks off stage to Rob

SUE
I thought that would’ve gone
better

ROB
Really

SUE

Don’t people go to church here

ROB
Yeah on Sundays

Beat

ROB
Hey look at it this way now you
have their sympathy They’1ll never
forget the woman who sang the Jesus
song at open mic night

He smiles she does not then drains her third gin and
tonic She looks back at Steve who gives her a completely
sarcastic thumbs up Sue wants to kill him Suddenly we
hear a voice on the mic Steve turns to see

DUSTIN
Hello Hello Testing Could I
have everyone’s attention for one
second please My name is--

There’s a squeak from the mic

DUSTIN
Whoa Hot mic

Dustin laughs The room is dead as they all look up at him
quizzically Dustin is holding a stack of leaflets

DUSTIN
I uh-- I just arrived in town and
wanted to introduce myself to all
of you and uh-- Oh man this seemed
like a much better idea when I was
standing in the back

Someone yells out

VOICE
Sing something

DUSTIN
How bout this If you give me just
30 seconds of your time I’1ll even
let you pick the song

There’s a few cheers and whistles

DUSTIN
My name is Dustin Noble and I work
for a small environmental group
called Athena

(MORE)
DUSTIN (CONTD)
We travel around the Northeast to
protect environmental habitats and
wildlife

CROWD
Boooo

Steve and Sue look on a bit confused Alice is now standing

by the bathroom door

DUSTIN
I grew up in a small town in
Nebraska my family was a 5th
generation farming family Dairy

There’s murmurs of frustration in the bar This is not what

they’re here for

DUSTIN
All our cows are now dead

The room is quieted slightly

DUSTIN
In March of 2008 my dad found 12
dead cows down by a creek a half a
mile from our house By April 80
of his herd was either sick or
dead And by Christmas he had
defaulted on his payments and the
bank eventually took his house 9
months 150 years that farm was in
our family and it only took 9
months to lose it It wasn’t just
us 16 other farms in that county
went under All the land just
died Shrivelled up and turned
brown Making it very easy to see
the only things left standing
Giant green tanks that said GLOBAL

The room begins to turn as people take this in Steve and

Sue notice Sue gets up and heads for the bathrooms
takes his cue and follows her

DUSTIN

So when I heard that you all were
going to put this to a VOTE Well
I had to come down here personally
and tell you my story This isn’t
some environmentalist conspiracy

This is my life The simple truth
is One day the farms were there

Steve

Dustin holds up the leaflets

DUSTIN
And one day they weren’t

SUE
What the hell is happening right
now

STEVE

That’s the guy

DUSTIN
My name is Dustin Noble I’m just
a hick from Nebraska and I’m here

for you

SUE
How much money do we have left I
got this

She turns and leaves Steve stands looking on for one more
moment

VOICE
BRUUUCE

DUSTIN
What’s that

There are a few chuckles

VOICE
Springsteen Sing

There is a small amount of laughter That leads to clapping
Dustin looks around at the crowd

DUSTIN
Oh man I don’t know about that
That’s sort of sacred ground to--

The keyboard player begins to play lightly ‘DANCING IN THE
DARK’ Dustin turns to her

DUSTIN
You gotta be kidding me

The rest of the band jumps in immediately The crowd reacts
goading him more He is screwed Weakly he tries

DUSTIN
- I get up in the evening And I
ain’t got nothin’ to say

The crowd cheers Dustin smiles

DUSTIN
I come home in the morning I go to
bed feeling the same way I ain’t
nothin’ but tired man I’m just
tired and bored with myself Hey
baby I could use just a little
help

Crowd joins in

DUSTIN
YOU CAN’T START A FIRE YOU CANT
START A FIRE WITHOUT A SPARK THIS
GUN’S FOR HIRE EVEN IF WE’RE JUST
DANCING IN THE DARK

Now the bar is full-on cheering Dustin on Steve looks over
and sees Alice watching Dustin He walks right up to her
and takes her arm

STEVE
Hey none of that stuff-- the
things he said It’s just not
true

She looks at him

STEVE
I’m not a bad guy

ALICE
I don’t think you are

After sharing a beat He heads to the door looking back at
Dustin The ENTIRE bar is on their feet People are dancing
and singing along He has the entire bar in the palm of his
hand

DUSTIN
They say you gotta stay hungry

Dustin in full swing grabs a girl
DUSTIN

HEY BABY I’M JUST ABOUT STARVING
TONIGHT

The place ERUPTS At the door Steve has had enough He
grabs a leaflet and walks out We stay on Dustin and the bar
for a few more moments He is a huge hit

EXT MOTEL-- PARKING LOT - NIGHT 40

Steve and Sue stand outside in the parking lot Steve is
holding the leaflet which depicts a poorly xeroxed picture of
what looks to be a dead animal with gas wells in the
background On the bottom in block print it reads GLOBAL
GO HOME

STEVE
“Global go home” what a crock of
shit

Steve slaps his neck

STEVE
Can we go inside Sue I’m getting
eaten alive How do you even know

SUE
Where else is he gonna stay
Steven

STEVE
None of that shit can be true
right

SUE

send us in blind

STEVE
I should have just confronted him
at the bar

SUE
In front of the whole town on

open mic night
Dustin’s car pulls up Sue gives a know-it-all look to Steve

SUE

As Dustin gets out of the car Steve walks up

Sue puts a hand on Steve’s arm

DUSTIN

I know how to beat it

STEVE
Oh really By telling bullshit sob

SUE

I hate to tell you you’re way out
of your league here We’ve signed
more than enough leases to move
forward with our development

DUSTIN
I wouldn’t underestimate these
people They’re--

Sue steps toward him

SUE
Trust me they’re poor They need
the money I know why you think
youre here and I admire your
commitment But your presence here
is only going to confuse people

Beat Dustin looks up at her She looks at him firmly As
he looks back down Sue reaches into her pocket and pulls out
an envelope

SUE
But we do appreciate what you’re
doing and would like to make a
donation to your fine organization

After a beat Dustin takes the envelope

SUE
We appreciate your cooperation
Okay
DUSTIN
Okay
SUE

Dustin picks up his bag and heads toward the motel

Steve shares a triumphant look with Sue

STEVE
He’s actually a nice kid
SUE

INTEXT BRONCO - DRIVING - DAY 41

Sue and Steve are driving through town not far from the
hotel We know this because though there is some land in
between the houses are closer together Sue sees something
in one of the few fields out the window She points

SUE
Okay Check out the horses

Sue slows down There are three horses off in the distance
Steve and Sue squint

STEVE
They do seem small

SUE
Next to the goats see

It’s hard to tell for sure but standing next to a few goats
the horses do look unusually small

STEVE
They should be bigger next to the
goats

SUE
Right

STEVE
You’re right Unless the goats
are big

SUE

Cmon Those goats are normal
Sue starts to accelerate Steve is beaming Then suddenly

STEVE
Holy shit

In the front lawn of the upcoming house there is a sign
posted out front It reads GLOBAL GO HOME It is an
enlarged and slightly clearer version of Dustin’s leaflet
They drive by Both Sue and Steve seem confused Then a
few houses up they see another one and another one

STEVE
What’s going on

Steve looks back to see the signs as they pass As he turns
back to face front

STEVE
Son of a bitch

At that moment Steve sees parked in the driveway of the
upcoming house Dustin’s car

STEVE
Pull over Pull over

EXT HOUSE - DAY 42

The Bronco pulls over to the side of the road as Dustin
walks out of the house with a large sign in his hand It is
a large blown up version of the leaflets he’s been handing
out which show a large photo of dead cattle and the words
GLOBAL GO HOME on the bottom A couple waves as he walks
down the walkway He is carrying a large cardboard poster
with him Steve launches out of the car trying
unsuccessfully to hide his fury Dustin sees him

DUSTIN
(Full volume to spite
Steve)
Hey Steve

STEVE
(To Dustin under his
breath)
What are you doing

Steve gives an overly cheerful wave to the couple on the
porch

STEVE
HELLO (To Dustin) What the fuck
are you doing here

DUSTIN
I’m telling these people the truth

Dustin sticks the sign in the ground
STEVE
We had an agreement

DUSTIN

Dustin leans on sign The couple looks on

STEVE

Well I guess I woke up this

confident than the other

STEVE

us is going to punch the other one
in the face

The couple goes back in the house a bit nervous Dustin
looks back and watches them go then turns back to Steve
concerned

DUSTIN
Steve stop Listen to me You’re

the past and they’re not
working Why is that

STEVE

leaflets is taped to his door
STEVE
Asshole
INT ROOM - DAY 47

We come up on an indecipherable background A greyish wall
After a beat

Dustin enters from out of frame as we pull out to reveal a
black board

DUSTIN
Good morning everyone My name is
Dustin
We immediately reveal a classroom of kids
KIDS
HI DUSTIN

As we pull out more we see that in front of him is a brown
bag of unknown supplies and on the floor is a large box
He’s talking to Alice’s 5th grade class She stands off to
the side admiring

DUSTIN
How many of you live on a farm

Almost all the hands go up

DUSTIN
Alright

From behind the desk he pulls up a large clear bag full of
dirt and places it on the table He then reaches into the
bag and pulls out a few toy figures of cows and horses
74A
DUSTIN
Now let’s say THIS is your farm

5TH GRADER
That’s a bag of dirt

DUSTIN
I know I know Geesh Thought
5th graders were supposed to have
imaginations (He smiles) Ok how
about this

He picks up a pencil and waves it over the bag of dirt
DUSTIN
In Spectro Peculium Poof Now
it’s a farm Ok

The kids laugh

DUSTIN
Whew Thank God for Harry Potter

We see that one of the children laughing is Carson Allen
Claire’s son

CUT TO

EXT SMALL HOUSE - DAY 48

Steve is standing on a porch waiting The door finally opens
and a large man stands inside the screen door

STEVE
Hey there My name is Steve Butler
and--

LARGE MAN

I know who you are You outta be
ashamed of yourself

STEVE
Look the information you’re
getting from this ATHENA guy is not
true If you look at--

The large man slams the door

INT CLASSROOM - DAY 49

DUSTIN
And this

From behind the desk he pulls up a big clear Tupperware
container and pours in a large bottle of water

DUSTIN
And THIS is all the water in town
The water you drink the water the
cows drink the water your puppies
and kittens drink and all the water
in the river for the fish

Alice looks at him warily a bit perplexed

DUSTIN
Now let me show you what happened
one day in my home town in a state
called Nebraska when this company
GLOBAL tried drilling for Natural
gas

He holds the bag over the container of water Suddenly he
begins puncturing the bottom of the bag with a pencil

DUSTIN
See they wanted to drill into the
land like this

The kids laugh at the rather destructive action Little bits
of dirt start falling into the water

DUSTIN
But unfortunately they don’t just
use a drill like the ones some of
your daddies have No they use
ones that shoot water and sand

Dustin takes a sports bottle and begins to shoot water into
the bag of dirt After a moment the bag begins dripping
dirty water out of the bottom The kids cheer

DUSTIN
But hold on hold on That’s not
all In order to do all that
drilling they need to use

From the brown paper bag he pulls out 5 or 6 bottles of home
cleaning products etc

DUSTIN
Chemicals Now these chemicals
that they use seem harmless when
they’re contained right In fact a
lot of the bad stuff up there you
can find right here in the bottles
under your sink at home But they
don’t use one chemical at a time
They use all of them

Dustin starts to pour all the products into the bag Alice
pulls away a little from the smell After a moment a gross
concoction of dark ooze starts dripping from the bag

KIDS
Ewwwww

Theyre all a bit horrified

EXT MOTEL PARKING LOT - DAY 50

They shake hands and smile Steve walks down the walkway
disappointed Suddenly he hears a voice

PAUL
There he is

Steve looks around and sees a man in his late 20’s sitting on
the porch of a neighboring trailer He waves

STEVE
Hey

Steve keeps walking

PAUL

Steve looks up at him
STEVE

Uh Well unfortunately I don’t

Steve looks into his folder

is listed at only 2 acres which isn’t big enough to house a

Steve smiles As he walks to the trailer his smile fades

He reaches into the box and pulls out a lighter A few
gasps

moment it IGNITES Then burns gently

sees on the windowsill is an aquarium Inside is a very
unlucky turtle

DUSTIN

What’s the turtle’s name
KIDS

Trigger
DUSTIN

Does his water look like it’s as
clean as this water

A few kids answer quietly

KIDS
No No way

Silence In a flash Dustin has pulled the turtle out and is
back in front of the flames

at the top overlooking the view Steve stands giving an
energetic pitch to Alice We can very softly hear the sound
of running water

STEVE
See you can tuck the wells in down
behind that group of trees to the
right

Steve looks at an aerial photograph on his clipboard of
Alice’s land

STEVE
And because of the way your
property is laid out we could put
an access road clear on the other
side so you wouldn’t even hear the
trucks

Beat

STEVE
(Jokingly)
And we could actually put the cash
machine right next to the couch I
slept on

Alice smiles

ALICE
This farm has been in my family for
over one hundred years

STEVE
Exactly and this money will keep
it in your family for another
hundred You wouldn’t see any of

She won’t even look at him Steve follows her as she walks
back to join a group that sits by the counter

He looks down the bar and sees Dustin sitting with a bunch of
people telling a story He sees Steve and waves Off
Steve’s face

EXT DENNON’S FARM - DAY 59

Next to a small dilapidated house is a beautiful expanse of
land with a stream running through it Steve stands by a
fence with aman This is Jeff Dennon mid thirties He is
repairing a part of the fence that keeps the animals out of
the stream Suddenly Steve grabs one of the fence poles and
helps Jeff Steve’s ability is completely second nature

STEVE
We send more than one BILLION
dollars overseas every DAY to fuel
our need for oil Now that’s just
insane To be spending so much
money to buy oil FIGHTING for so
much oil When we have one of the
largest natural energy sources
right here in our back yard Now
this guy from Athena’s going around
lying to everybody and--

JEFF
Mr Butler you seem like a good
enough man so I’m going to be
straight with you so as to not
waste your time That little boy
you saw when you came to the door

Steve nods

JEFF
He lost his father my brother 6
years ago in Fallujah So you

don’t need to lecture me on the
whole foreign oil dependency
routine But let me ask you one
question Steve If I do this
what do I say to that boy What am
I telling him What am I telling
him about this farm that my daddy
gave me and his daddy gave him
What am I telling him about what
his daddy went to the desert to
fight for See you and I both
know that the only reason you’re
here is because we’re poor

Steve doesn’t respond

JEFF
How many wells you got up near
Manhattan What about
Philadelphia Or Pittsburgh

Steve still says nothing
JEFF

It’s alright I get it That’s
what we’re here for Nothin’ new

Beat
JEFF
But you’ll never get what you came
here to take from me and to be

honest I don’t even like the fact
that you’re here trying

Off Steve’s look

EXT FAIR GROUNDS - DAY 60

Steve works in the hot sun bringing bails of hay from the
back of the Bronco and stacking them He makes it look
effortless We finally see the farmer he once was Where
he’s stacking them we see several fully built animal pens
There’s a mule in one of them A large cart next to it Sue
arrives carrying a lemonade

SUE
I’ve only been handing out flyers
for like two hours and I want to
die I don’t know how that Athena
guy does it (Noticing Steves
progress) Oh my God How’d you
do all this Is that a donkey

Steve begins to walk through the area he has just set up
Sue follows

STEVE
A mule yeah the guy down the
street let me borrow him to help
dig out the course

SUE
What course

STEVE
Pig races

SUE

I don’t like that you said that
without even a smile

Beat Steve has arrived at a little well He expertly hand
pumps some water to splash water on his face He then takes
a long drink

SUE
You alright
STEVE
Yeah I’m just sick of this shit

This thing will close them Let’s
end this and get the hell out of
here

Sue pauses for a second seeing his change

SUE
Alright then

Suddenly a pick up truck pulls up with two men in the front
and 4 men in the back They get out and walk up The
driver is Rob

ROB
Thought you could use a little
help

Steve is taken aback
STEVE
Uh yeah-- Yes Thank you You
could work on putting up those food
tents

ROB
You got it lLet’s go

The men walk past Sue looks at Steve and smiles

INT MOTEL - STEVE’S ROOM - MORNING 61

Steve finishes up getting ready and goes to head out the
door He looks back to see if he’s left anything as he opens
the door When he turns back to leave

He runs right into what seems like a wall As he steps back
we realize what it is Like a college dorm prank Dustin
has stapled a huge version of the poster across Steves
entire door Steve has finally had it

STEVE
God DAMN it

Without even looking at it grabs the poster and as if ina
street fight wrestles with it finally ripping it down the
middle Sadly exhausted Steve throws the crumpled and bent
pieces of poster into his room Furious he leaves and slams
the door

EXT CLAPBOARD HOUSE - PORCH - DAY 62

Sue sits on the front porch with Claire Allen She is
signing a lease In the yard in front of them Carson is
throwing a baseball with a friend They are both wearing
their homemade baseball t-shirts Sue watches them

CLAIRE
Is that it

Sue snaps out of it

SUE
That’s it

Claire puts her hand on Sue’s

CLAIRE
- thank you

Sue takes this in and smiles

EXT FAIR GROUNDS - DAY 63

The work site is buzzing There is now a large group of
people working together to help Steve Without any
hesitation Steve unloads horses out of a truck raises tents
with several other people puts up fencing for the pens All
the while he is happy We see now that he is completely
in his element

EXT BASEBALL FIELD - DAY 64

Sue is sitting in the stands of a little league baseball
game Close on her we can see that there is something
different about her She is completely at ease almost
like she’s somewhere else Suddenly she begins clapping

We pull out to reveal that there is a change of innings
happening Sue is sitting on the right field line As one
team heads towards Sue the team from the opposite dugout is
taking the field We track the boy heading towards first
base As he comes closer we realize it is Carson Allen
we can now see his shirt A brand new YANKEES jersey
professionally done He finally reaches first base and turns
back to the field On the back of his shirt we see the

number ‘15’ and above that GLOBAL written in bold
letters
INT GEARY’S TRAILER - DAY 65

Steve sits with Paul Geary Paul finishes signing the final
page in a flourishing last signature He laughs out loud and
looks across the table to Steve Then suddenly he jumps up
and heads to a cabinet under the sink and pulls out a bottle
that’s only a third full

PAUL
For special occasions

He pours into 2 cheap non matching glasses and hands one to
Steve and clinks his glass As Paul laughs in celebration
Steve finally laughs too It’s genuine Paul’s energy is
infectious

EXT TOWN FAIR - DAY 66

The fair is now nearly complete there are pigs in the pen
food tents are up even the ferris wheel is up It looks
great Steve is now covered in dirt and sweat He is
directing several people where to put the port-a-potties as
SUE walks up sipping on a lemonade Steve looks at her
drinking

STEVE
Again with the lemonade

SUE
You don’t understand it’s insane

Steve looks behind Sue On the sidewalk is an 11 year old
girl at a lemonade stand

STEVE
Jesus she’s everywhere
SUE
Well Everywhere the people are

Steve
(MORE)

SUE (CONTD)
She’s a little raging capitalist
You should hire her now while you
can afford her

Sue smiles

STEVE
It’s weird that you crack yourself

up
Suddenly Steve sees something

STEVE
Holy Shit

Walking up to Steve is Frank Yates
FRANK

fair

FRANK
It’s still a town fair Steve
I’m not a communist Now where do

Long beat
SUE
Wanna help blow up the bouncy
castles

Steve points him in a direction of the bouncy castles

FRANK
Sounds good

He walks away as Sue and Steve just stand awestruck

EXT PICK-UP TRUCKROAD INTO TOWN - DUSK 67

Similar to the first introduction to the town we follow a
pick up truck full of people as it drives down the road
There are 3 people jammed in the front and a whole bunch

packed in the back
faces and then come

We pan through all the tired and dirty
upon Steve We hold on the whole

group laughing about something and then hold as we watch the
truck turn down main street

INT BUDDYS - NIGH

The entire team working on the fair walks in and takes a seat

in a group Steve takes a head count and then walks to the
bar Jesse comes over

STEVE

Hey Jesse Well start with a

Jesse walks away as

Steve wipes his face with a bar napkin

He is happy Suddenly

Nice work

VOICE
Steve

Steve turns to reveal Dustin

DUSTIN

Hey

DUSTIN
Thanks again for the beer Steve

Dustin gets up and walks to Alice who still looks
uncomfortably to Steve

DUSTIN

Dustin and Alice start to walk Alice turns back to Steve

ALICE

fair tomorrow should be fun
STEVE
Yeah
ALICE
‘Night

They walk off

We hold on Steve who is still frozen holding

his pitchers like a jackass

INT MOTEL - SUE’S ROOM - NIGHT 69

Sue sits on the

bed She is Skyping with her son She’s

putting on a happy face but something is hurting There is
a commotion on the other end of the computer

SUE

Well I don’t know what to say A
no hitter

DANNY
It was only 2 innings

SUE
I don’t care Did anyone get on
base

DANNY
- No

SUE

Then that’s actually a perfect

game

That’s amazing

DANNY

It’s not the whole game Mom

From the other side we hear other kids’ voices yelling “COME

ON Danny”

SUE
Well you shouldn’t be on the
computer with me
Suddenly another kid’s face pops into the frame

BOY
Hey MS T

SUE
Hi Colin

The boy disappears

SUE
Ok go go Where you guys headed
tonight

DANNY

I don’t know Sarah Dayton’s
having a party I think

Sue is trying her best to keep it together

SUE

- you look really nice
DANNY

Ok
SUE

DANNY
Ok mom

Long beat Then with a wave he’s gone Sue just stares at
the remaining glow on the screen
EXT BUDDYS - NIGHT 70

Steve exits the bar a little drunk There is a giant man
finishing a cigarette outside Steve takes a deep breath

The man holds out the pack of cigarettes

STEVE
No thanks I’m good

He looks back up to the sky Suddenly a car pulls up in
front It’s a brand new Corvette The lights blind Steve
then go off A door opens and we hear

VOICE
STEVE

Steve squints to see who it is as his eyes adjust It’s Paul
Geary

PAUL
It’s Paul

Steve can’t believe what he’s seeing

STEVE

PAUL

As he heads inside Steve stands staring at the car looking
like he could be sick
INT BUDDYS -- LATER THAT NIGHT 71

It’s late Paul is gone Only a few people remain in the
bar Steve sits staring off into space it seems

After a moment we here a loud voice yell

VOICE
Hey

Steve spins in his stool and through blurred vision sees the
source of the noise 4 men obviously farmers sit at a
nearby table One of them is Jeff Dennon the man whose
brother died in Fallujah Steve looks away

JEFF
HEY

Steve doesn’t turn
JEFF
I just heard you’re a-- someone
told me you’re from Iowa

JEFF

And your daddy he was-- your
daddy’s a farmer

STEVE

Steve looks away And laughs All the farmers now stand up
and move toward Steve

JEFF
You have somethin’ to say

Beat Tensions are high Steve turns to them finally

STEVE
You people baffle me How you
just don’t get it

JEFF
Well why don’t you explain it to
us What the hell are we missin’
here
STEVE
Money And I’m not talking about
little pay increases I’m talking
about “Fuck you” money

Some of the men shift their weight but say nothing

STEVE
Don’t want to apply for college
loans for your kids This money
says “Fuck you” loans You worried
about car payments “Fuck you”
payments The bank’s gonna forclose
on your family farm “Fuck you”
bank “Fuck you” money is the
ultimate liberator And underneath
this town is “fuck you” money You
think long and hard about all those
brutal days workin’ And the
bullshit checks you get from
whatever goddamn frozen peas
company that’s buying You think
about how much you made on your
best day and then you think real
hard about how much you made on
your worst Cuz let’s be real
honest with each other they’re all
starting to look like that more and
more arent they These people
This town This life It’s dying
and damn near dead And you all
see it coming And you just won’t
get the hell out of the way
Why Pride Of WHAT What
have you got And for fuck’s sake
how much of it is even yours
Hell I bet all four of you are
collecting subsidy checks from the
government Well when they stop
comin’ When all that help stops
comin’ and you’ve got nowhere to
go You’ll remember this
conversation and remember the guy
who looked you right in the eye and
said “Fuck you”

In a flash the biggest quietest farmer walks forward and
punches Steve in the face immediately dropping him to the

ground We see
Steve earlier

they’re furious

it’s the LARGE MAN that shut the door on
The farmers stand over him and we can see
but they also listened It’s intense

LARGE MAN

You’re an asshole

71A

The farmers walk out Slowly Steve gets up and sits back in
his chair He takes a deep breath For the first time we
see what Steve has been staring at before the Farmers came
over to him

Behind the bar under all the bottles he notices a series of
Polaroid pictures lined up Above the pictures is written in
big glittery letters “ABSOLUT MADNESS” At the end of the
row of pictures is Steve For the first time we get a
glimpse into the horror that was Steve’s first night in town
In the picture Steve is ruddy faced and sweating he
almost doesn’t look human He’s in mid-scream and holds up
his hands in metal-fan fashion fingers posed in the shape of
horns He looks ridiculous but in his head he looks
awesome Underneath each picture is the name of a state or
city Under Steve’s it says ‘IOWA’

INT MOTEL - STEVE’S ROOM - NIGHT 71A

Steve sits on the bed staring off We hold on him as he
contemplates what just happened and what is happening
Suddenly the phone rings He looks over to it quickly It
rings again he picks it up

STEVE
- Alice

SUE (0OS)
No but our rooms connect if you’re
that desperate

STEVE
Jesus Sue

SUE (0S)
Just wanted to make sure you were
behaving Tomorrow’s a big day

STEVE
Yeah I got it
SUE
Get some sleep Steven
STEVE
Ok I got it
SUE
Steve
STEVE

YEAH

SUE
Great job

STEVE
»-You too

Steve hangs up

As Steve stares we hear the pre-lap of thunder

EXT TOWN FAIR - AFTERNOON 72

Rain pours down on the town fair Lights have fallen and
dangle over the ground The bouncy castles are half
deflated The banner at the front is heavy with water as the
ink runs off

Across the street we see Sue and Steve’s Bronco

INT BRONCO - AFTERNOON 73

Steve is sitting in the passenger seat He and Sue stare
silently out at the wreckage illuminated by the headlights

STEVE
-We lost

SUE
Let’s go

Steve stares a moment longer Sue turns the key the truck
is dead Sue leans back and sighs

Suddenly Steve reaches over and turns the key again and
one more time holding the key through a horrible sound The
truck is dead

SUE
Stop

He doesn’t let go

SUE
Steve Stop

Steve begins turning the key over and over furiously Then
he begins punching the steering wheel until finally he
screams and jumps out of the truck

STEVE
FUUUUUUUUUUCK

He begins kicking the truck over and over until he’s
exhausted He just stands in the middle of the street in the
dim glow of the headlights Sue stares at him from inside
She says nothing

Suddenly headlights come up on Steve standing in the rain
getting soaked He looks over A car stops in front of him
and the window rolls down to reveal Frank

FRANK
Nice day

INT FRANK YATES’ HOUSE -- LATE DAY 74

Sue and Steve sit at the kitchen table with Frank and his
wife Arlene They’re finishing a warm and hearty meal --
turkey potatoes salad homemade cranberry sauce carrot
cake The red wine has been flowing too most of it going
to Steve He seems a bit dark

SUE
God That was so good

STEVE
Really nice Thank you

ARLENE
You’re more than welcome

SUE
I have to get the recipe for those
potatoes Arlene

ARLENE
Of course You cook Sue

SUE
I do My son and I-- well I make
him help me

Sue pulls out her iPhone and shows her a picture

SUE
He used to stand on a chair next to
me but now he’s so tall He likes
cutting things vegetables and all
that That’s how I get him to talk -
- stand side by side you know
working on something

Steve’s eating the last of the carrot cake

ARLENE
So your husband watches him while
youre traveling for work

SUE
My ex-husband watches him yes
while I agonize

ARLENE

(getting up clearing

dishes)
Divorce is a monster You just have
to work double-hard I imagine
Franks father died when he was
only 8 His mother always talked
about the clarity of purpose How
helpful that was There’s just you
and the kid nothing else You
know exactly what you have to do
every day

Sue’s eyes reflect absolute recognition Frank hasn’t taken
his eyes off Steve who is fairly drunk already As Frank
talks we begin to push in on Steve

FRANK
What about you Steve Where did
you say you were from Iowa

STEVE
Eldridge
ARLENE
(laughs )
Oh yeah Any family still up
there
STEVE
ee NO
FRANK

Wait a minute did you say Eldridge
Didn’t they have a-- a plant up
there

STEVE
Caterpillar plant

Steve nods He’s in his own world

FRANK
Yeah that’s right Had a friend
from Boeing who was from there I
remember that Wasn’t pretty

STEVE
When they closed it that was
it The town was hollowed out

Sue looks at Steve If she’s heard this information before
it’s never revealed Steve in quite the same way

FRANK
What and no pretty lady to hand
out free money and save you

Sue smiles a half smile Steve doesn’t respond

SUE
Yeah Steve and what if there had
been

STEVE
(Quiet)
I’d move so fuckin’ fast

Pause

STEVE
Id take that money and leave
(Pointed) Just leave

The room is silenced After a beat

FRANK
(Gently )
And where would we all go

This lands on Steve He says nothing The room says
nothing Suddenly Steve excuses himself and walks out onto
the back deck The other three just remain seated

EXT FRANK YATES’ PORCH (MOMENTS LATER) - LATE DAY 75

Steve stands looking over the rail of the porch onto the
expansive land behind Frank’s house In the dwindling light
it is not only beautiful it’s close to perfect After a
long moment Frank exits the house carrying 2 cups of coffee
Steve is staring intently at something As Frank joins
Steve we finally get to see what he’s looking at It’s a
horse perfectly proportioned but very small standing out by
Frank’s barn

FRANK
Miniature horse

STEVE
Oh my God we thought we were
losing our minds We kept seeing
them from a distance and couldn’t
tell -- it was altering our whole
sense of perspective

The horse grazes on a bale of hay A dog sits nearby

FRANK
A lot us breed them They eat like
rhinos Some people think they’re
some kind of abomination Big
industry up here

STEVE
What do they get for ‘em

FRANK
Not enough Steve

Steve finally smiles Frank smiles with him

FRANK
You’re a good man Steve

Steve looks over Frank continues looking out

FRANK
You have so many of the qualities
we need more of these days

Steve doesn’t know what to say

FRANK
I just wish you weren’t doing this

This hits Steve like a brick He looks at Frank perhaps to
say something but is completely disarmed

FRANK
You know I used to work up at
some stables just north of here
They used to have a poker game
every Friday night the farm hands
and the stable boys One of the
favorite stories in town was the
night I took 50 dollars from the
owner Russ Clayborn I had raised
him 20 dollars And scared him
into folding a full house That
was 2 weeks pay

(MORE)
105-106

FRANK (CONTD)
I was 18 years old and I ran all
the way home holding three months
of our mortgage I was so damn
proud (Frank chuckles Steve
smiles ) I ran into the house
threw the money on the kitchen
table and told my mom I bet
everything on a pair of 3’s and
won

Beat

FRANK
She took one look at the money
and kicked me out of the house
Had to stay at my aunt’s fora
week When I asked her why she
just said “You could have lost”

Beat Steve looks over at Frank but says nothing

FRANK
In those days it was harder to find
a man that was willing to bet it
all

Beat

FRANK
We have nothing left to sell and we
cant afford to buy anything You
came here to help us Offer us
money All we had to do to get it
was be willing to scorch the earth
under our feet

Beat Neither man says anything

FRANK
Don’t get me wrong Steve I’m not
better than my neighbors -- hell I
need the money too

Beat

FRANK
(Chuckles )
I guess I’m just lucky lucky to
be old enough to have a shot at
dying with my dignity

Beat Frank heads inside Turns at the door
105-106A

FRANK
Let me know when you’re ready to
head back

We hold on Steve’s face Frank walks to the door He
suddenly stops and without turning back

FRANK
I’m so worried for us Steve

INT MOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT 75A

Steve and Sue walk in the front door Steve is still ina
haze

SUE
Get some sleep Steve

She walks off Steve turns to a make shift coffee maker and
pours himself a cup Suddenly the woman behind reception
says

WOMAN
Excuse me Excuse me sir

Steve doesn’t respond

WOMAN
Steve

Steve turns but says nothing

WOMAN
There’s a package here for you

Steve walks up and gets it It is a poster canister package
with GLOBAL return address sticker in the corner Instead of
an address it just says his name

STEVE
Thank you

INT MOTEL - STEVE’S ROOM - NIGHT 75AA

We are close on Steve as he opens the package on his bed He
pulls out the contents and we immediately see a note written
in bold that says URGENT FROM RESEARCH DEPARTMENT
SUBJECT DUSTIN NOBLE Underneath the note is paperwork of
an insurance claim and other statistics All of which Steve
breezes through until he gets to a large photo We
immediately recognize something familiar the dead cows

As Steve looks harder we see the building behind the cows and
recognize it as the same building in the background of
Dustin’s leaflets But this photo is from a different angle
and much wider now showing the surrounding farm and land
rather than just the cows and the barn behind it Red
circles are around objects in the background After taking
it all in and processing as fast as he can

STEVE
Holy shit

107-109A

Steve jumps off the bed and runs out of frame with the
poster

INT MOTEL - HALLWAY - NIGHT 76

Steve thunders down the hallway

INT MOTEL - RANDOM HOTEL ROOM DOOR - NIGHT 77

Steve is frantically banging on a door He waits a beat
then pounds again After a moment the door opens to
reveal Sue Steve bursts into the room

STEVE
We got him We GOT him

SUE
Don’t ever do that again

STEVE
His whole sob story is bullshit
I knew it It was the only way he
could beat us

Steve throws some paperwork on the bed and begins to open a
poster

SUE
What are you talking about What
is that

STEVE

Research ran a check They found
this He lied It’s some bullshit
claim that has nothing to do with
us

SUE
Why what does it say

Sue reaches for the paperwork on the bed but just then Steve
fully unveils the poster

STEVE
Sue What is this

SUE
It’s the photo of his farm

STEVE
And where is this farm
107-109B

SUE
What

STEVE
Where is this farm

SUE

Steve points to something in the background of the photo
Sue looks at it

SUE
A silo

STEVE
- Look closer

Sue squints then

SUE
- Holy shit

Steve smiles HUGE

STEVE
THAT is a fuckin’ lighthouse

SUE
Holy Shit

STEVE
Now geography was never my strong
suit but I’m pretty sure there are
no oceans in Nebraska

SUE
He made the whole thing up

STEVE
And when this town finds out That
he lied That he manipulated these
people to get their vote They’re
gonna have fucking FIELD day with
this guy

Sue looks at Steve

a moment he picks it up

RICHARDS
Hello Hey Steve What

EXT ALICE’S HOUSE - NIGHT

Steve knocks on a door He is holding the poster After
moment Alice opens She can see something is wrong
There’s a long pause as they stare at each other

STEVE
Dustin’s a liar

Steve hands her the poster She begins to look at it

STEVE (CONTD)
He lied about everything

ALICE
What are you talking about

He points to the lighthouse He knows she’1ll get it

STEVE
I just came from Richards’ The
whole town will know by morning
But I wanted you to hear it from
me

107-109D

She looks up at Steve

STEVE (CONTD)
You deserve someone who tells the
truth

ALICE
Why did you come here Steve

STEVE
I told you I’m not a bad guy
Good night Alice

He turns and begins to walk Suddenly her turns

STEVE (CONTD)
Hey if I HAD asked you out--

ALICE
-- I would’ve said yes

Pause Steve finally smiles

ALICE (CONTD)
Good night Steve

Smiling she shuts the door Off Steve’s look

EXT MOTEL PARKING LOT - NIGHT 78

Steve walks up the street to the parking lot He is deep in
thought Suddenly we hear a door close Steve looks up to
see Dustin They stare at each other frozen for a
moment

STEVE
What you did is going to hurt a lot
of people

Dustin walks to the car without speaking

STEVE (CONTD)
What were you thinking man I
mean how does somebody do that
You base your entire case against
us on a lie

DUSTIN
Look I just talked to Richards

guaranteed us the win

DUSTIN

You’re gonna lose Steve
STEVE

What
DUSTIN

It might not be Athena who does it
but one of these days you’ll lose
I just hope I’m there to see it

STEVE
Well I can guarantee it’s not
gonna be Athena Do you have any
idea how bad this is Athena’s
done It’s over for you

DUSTIN
What else was I supposed to do
Steve This isn’t a fair fight
Jesus Christ I go around doing
what Handing out leaflets and
posters I’m out there on my own
I’ve got nothing man This vote
meant everything I had too

STEVE
No You didn’t have to You
fucked up

DUSTIN

Then what else am I supposed to do
You tell me Steve In a world
where nobody cares Where a
company like yours can do that in
Lafayette Louisiana Or here in
Mckinley Or the next place you
go Because you know it’s gonna
happen again and again So you
tell me Steve What am I supposed
to do

Long Pause

STEVE
I never said this farm was in
Lafayette Louisiana
107-109F

DUSTIN
What What are you talking
about

STEVE

I never told you this happened in
Lafayette Louisiana How could
you know that

DUSTIN
Those people needed my help Steve
They called ME

STEVE
No they didn’t You said yourself
were too clever We make sure in
all that fine print that they’re
never allowed to call anyone
Definitely not an environmentalist

Pause

DUSTIN
Ok Steve

STEVE
Dustin how did you know where this
farm was

Pause Dustin looks off
STEVE (CONTD)

Jesus Christ where did you even
get these pictures for your

posters
DUSTIN
Steve
STEVE
Jesus Christ Dustin-- why are you
here
Long beat
DUSTIN
Fuck That was stupid I
should’ve just gotten in the car
Beat

DUSTIN
We were never gonna let them vote
107-109G

Steve is completely taken aback After a long moment It
hits him

STEVE
- You’re with Global Jesus
Christ you’re with global

DUSTIN
Did you really think a they were
going to leave something like this
in your hands After you let them
bring it to a vote Come on
companies like Global don’t rely on
anyone That’s how they win They
win by controlling every outcome
They do that by playing both

sides
STEVE
But I’ve been--
DUSTIN
What What did you do Steve

What is it you think you did I
did everything All this is me
Athena is me This story is me
Getting you the package to take to
the politician is me See
you’ve only done what I’ve allowed
(expected) (Supposed to) (wanted)
(Knew you) (predicted) you to
do And you did your job It
worked It’s done We win

Beat Steve says nothing
Steve looks up

STEVE
So this farm--

DUSTIN
Oh come on Steve stay with me
This farm doesn’t matter They’ve
already dealt with this That’s
done

STEVE
They said it was a false claim

DUSTIN
Steve
107-109H

STEVE
But this happened this
happened

DUSTIN
Of course it happened And now

let me give you a bit of advice
you’re gonna want to stop asking
questions You’re at the big kids
table

Beat Dustin looks into Steve’s eyes

DUSTIN (CONTD)
You’re a good choice for this
Steve You’ll do a good job Good
luck in New York

Dustin walks to the truck and opens the door He starts the
car and in a moment he’s gone

Steve just stands alone in the parking lot devastated
still holding the poster

After a moment he turns to the door of the motel Standing
behind the screen door is Sue

SUE
Funny Smart

OMITTED

79A INT ROB’S STORE - AFTERNOON 79A

up and smiles

SUE
(Knowingly )

As Rob rings her up

ROB
(Smiling)

SUE
Oh yeah
ROB

This reaches Sue more than she’1l ever show Rob looks at

They both know this was their goodbye Sue turns and leaves

79B INT HIGH SCHOOL - AFTERNOON 79B

We see a mirror One again Steve pops up into the frame
splashing water on his face We widen out to reveal he is
in a high school bathroom He looks at himself in the
mirror We can hear the rumblings of a large group of people
in the background We hold on Steve The sounds get louder
as we cut to

80 INT HIGH SCHOOL GYMNASIUM - AFTERNOON 80

In the stands once again a crowd is gathered much larger
than the first time Once again many of them are holding
lemonades Steve enters through the door holding the taped
together poster He looks out to center court where Richards
is getting ready to begin

RICHARDS
Ok so if everyone can take their
seats please We have a lot to get
to today
Steve seems tense nervous Suddenly

VOICE
Lemonade

Steve turns to see just a few feet away from him is the
lemonade girl

STEVE
Is it good

GIRL
Really good

Steve looks and sees she has set up right in between the door
and the stands

STEVE
You got a good spot here

GIRL
I know

The girl smiles Steve smiles back and picks up a cup He
takes a sip tasting it for the first time

STEVE
« Wow

GIRL
I know

She smiles He places a dollar on the table and picks up the
poster readying himself We suddenly hear the sound of
coins

GIRL
Mister
Steve turns
GIRL
You forgot your change
STEVE
Oh no no That’s for you
The girl is confused and then puts her arm out holding the
change
GIRL

The sign says it’s only twenty five
cents So it’s only twenty five
cents

114-115

This honesty and purity hits Steve he reaches his hand out
and takes the change Looking down at her looking at him

STEVE
»- Really good

INT GYMNASIUM - AFTERNOOON 81

A man comes up and stands next to Richards He indicates the
basketball team at the other door now in uniform

RICHARDS

(To the coach)
I know I know We’re just gonna
be a few more minutes

(Back to the crowd)
Now before we get to the vote
Steve Butler just wanted to say a
few words

Steve arrives at center court and looks out to the bleachers
Sue sits in the front row Steve looks around and takes some
of the familiar faces he has come to know Drew Jeff
Claire Arlene Frank etc He lands on Alice She looks
back at him He gives her a small smile
116-117

Steve holds up the poster
He looks out at the crowd After a long pause

STEVE
I know there’s been a lot of talk
about this poster So I figured
I’d just show you all

He shows them

STEVE (CONTD)
I was looking at this picture for a
while last night A long while
But I found myself staring at this
barn The wood on the side is
buckling Probably from all the
salt water in the air The paint’s
chipping and the flag is fading
It reminded me of my grandfathers
barn That barn was the bane of
my existence it was immaculate
It seemed like every other summer
we were out painting that thing
Hours and hours in all that
heat And I remember asking him
why Why do we have to do this
And he’d just look at me and say
“It’s our barn Who else is going
to do it”

STEVE (CONTD)
I always thought he was crazy
And stubborn and Proud

Pause Steve looks to Alice

STEVE (CONT’D)
But I think he was just trying to
teach me how to take care of
something

Beat

STEVE (CONTD)

You all know Dustin lied That he
made up a story to get you to vote
the way he wanted you to and in the
end that’s exactly what he did
Dustin isn’t an environmentalist
Dustin works for Global Global
couldn’t afford an environmental
presence so they created their

own
(MORE)
116-117A

STEVE (CONTD)
They wanted to make the decision
for you and they were betting
that you’d let them

Beat

STEVE (CONTD)
They were doing all this to protect
themselves Because this isn’t
Dustin’s farm but it did happen
This is a Global farm Now I’m
not saying this would happen here
But they know the only reason we’re
all in this room is to ask
what if it did

Beat

STEVE (CONTD)
I don’t know what the answer is
anymore But at this point
Where we are We’re betting a lot
more than we think Everything we
have-- everything we are is on the
table now And it’s just not ours
to lose

STEVE (CONTD)
This is still our barn No matter
what they do no matter what they
think it’s still our barn
that’1ll never change

Steve just stands No one says anything Sue just stares at
him After a moment he sees the players in the doorway

STEVE (CONT’D)
- Go Pioneers

Steve heads for the door a man with purpose

EXT GYMNASIUM - PARKING LOT 82

Sue leans on the front end of the Bronco Suddenly she looks
over to see Steve walking out of the gymnasium She’s
finishing up a phone call

SUE
- I understand

She doesn’t even look at Steve as he walks up to the Bronco
She hangs up

STEVE
Was that them

SUE

Yes You’re definitely fired
STEVE

And you
SUE

They want to see me in the city
tomorrow

Steve smiles Sue walks around the car and gets in Steve
comes around to the passenger side door

STEVE
Congratulations

Beat Sue is processing all of this at once

SUE
Can I give you a lift somewhere

STEVE
C’mon Sue

Beat She looks up at him

STEVE
It’s open mic night

Sue smiles Then her smile fades She pauses and looks
forward

SUE
It’s just a job

She starts the car Looks back at him
SUE

- Oh for the love of God at
least get some new boots
Steve smiles

STEVE
- Not a chance

She drives off

Steve just stands and watches the car drive away Then take
a turn and disappear

He is now alone Quietly we begin to hear music

Steve finally turns and walks across the street As we
follow him we finally see Buddys The music begins to
build

Steve looks to the bar and barely but enough we can see a
sign OPEN MIC NIGHT

The camera widens as Steve enters the bar And as the
camera continues to rise we see for the first time a
shot of this main street the first full picture of this
town

WE HARD CUT TO
BLACK

THE END
