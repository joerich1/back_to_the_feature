FADE IN

INT MANHATTAN STREETS - CAB - DAY

Behind the wheel JERRY FLETCHER Flat-out handsome if
not for his eyes Someone rash someone making an

uninformed decision might call them crazy eyes He stops
across from an apartment building TOOTS his HORN

IN DOORWAY
A woman and a man a CYNIC appear Jerry smiles as they
kiss goodnight A bit of desperate passion She watches
after him as he gets in the cab

CYNIC
Luxembourg Towers on 7th

INT CAB

Jerry nods rolls out The Cynic watches the door to
1257 close then sighs Jerry looks at him in the
rearview

JERRY
The sound of love

CYNIC
Excuse me

Jerry exhales an exaggerated sigh

JERRY
Thats love

CYNIC
Love Loves just a pretty way of
saying I want to sleep with
you Love is bullshit

JERRY
I live on tips so dont be
offended but youre a liar IT
saw you kiss Admit it this is
the street where love lives

The Cynic looks back over his shoulder Down love
street As Jerry hangs a right the Cynic faces forward

JERRY
Love gives you wings It makes
you fly I dont even call it
love I call it Geronimo

CYNIC
Geronimo

JERRY
Geronimo When youre really in
love youll jump Off the top of
the Empire State Screaming
Geronimo the whole way down

CYNIC
But youll die Youll squash
yourself Whats the point
JERRY
Arent you listening man Love
gives you wings

The Cynic just smiles leans back

CYNIC
She must be some girl

JERRY

I love her so bad She just
wrecks me I would die for her

ANOTHER ANGLE

Jerry stops at a light A road crew are at work ahead
A white strobe light warns motorists that theyre here

CYNIC
She feel the same about you

Jerry cant take his eyes off the stroke As he blinks

JERRY
I dont know

FLASH CUT TO

SUBJECTIVE POV

Looking down as a mans arms are strapped to the arm of a
chair The POV JERKING UP as the same is done with the
head A kaleidoscope of flashing lights ahead then
darkness as eyes are shut Theyre forced open We see
the reflection of blue eyes in glass as theyre taped
open As bright lights strobe

BACK TO TAXI

Jerry stares at the light transfixed

JERRY
I never told her

CYNIC
Why the hell not

JERRY
I uh I have some problems

The traffic light glows green Jerry doesnt see it The
sound of conspiratorial WHISPERS fill the taxi
FLASH CUT TO

SUBJECTIVE POV

The contents of a syringe pumped into the strapped arm
The walls begin to melt The WHISPERS CONTINUE

GARBLED but their tone is perfectly clear Threatening
Cabalistic Human forms appear Stretched impossibly
long melting along with the walls

We CLOSE ON the reflection of a dozen pair of the same
taped-open eyes The WHISPERING CUTS SHORT Ominously
The eyes dart from side-to-side as FOOTSTEPS approach
The eyes suddenly widen in agony As Jerrys scream of
pain becomes the BLARE of a HORN we find ourselves back
in the

TAXT

Going about 60 mph Jerry snaps to just in time to avoid
a head-on collision with a car coming the other way

CYNIC
Are you crazy

JERRY
The guy came right at us

CYNIC
You turned up a one way street

Jerry watches in a sweat as he passes a ONE WAY sign
pointing the opposite way He mutters to himself

JERRY
I was only going one way

CYNIC
Drop me off here

JERRY
Look Im sorry --

CYNIC
Just drop me off

ANOTHER ANGLE

Jerry pulls to the curb The meter at 360 The Cynic
slides a twenty through the slot and is out the door

Jerry watches over his shoulder as the Cynic disappears
down the street Jerry rubs his eyes tries to regroup

JERRY
Love street

EXT FIFTH AVENUE (MANHATTAN) - NIGHT

Late The cab rolls this time the right way Ahead a
well-dressed man steps off the curb flags Jerry down

CAB

Jerry slows stops As the well-dressed man starts over
Jerry sizes him up The man seems suddenly sinister

As he reaches for the door LOCKS CLICK DOWN Jerry GUNS
the CAB away The confused man stumbles back shouts
apparently not a threat at all

EXT APARTMENT BUILDING (UPTOWN) - NIGHT

Headlights out the cab pulls up to the curb

INT CAB - NIGHT

Jerry glances at a lit 2nd floor apartment window then
settles in with a bologna sandwich About to take a
bite he pauses removes a slice of bologna He regards
it a beat then carefully peels off the edge Jerry
holds the narrow casing up against the glow of a
streetlight like it was encoded Then something catches
his eye He trades the sandwich for binoculars focuses
on the window

BINOCULAR POV - WINDOW

LIZA SUTTON In a Yale sweatshirt stretching earphones
on She forces her head past her kneecap and holds it
there Driven is the word to describe Liza When she
sleeps she tries to do it better than anyone else does
We cant hear her but as she finishes stretching she
sings along with the music on her headset

JERRY

captivated he sighs -- the sound of love Then he gets
an idea Still watching he fumbles for the RADIO
Turning it ON he SCANS radio STATIONS

Lips in synch Thats what shes singing along with

JERRY (VO)
(joins in)
Blue moon you saw me standing
alone
INTERCUT between them Without a song in my heart
without a love of my own Blue moon In a weird way

its a duet A sweet moment Then Liza stops

She gets on a treadmill and cranks it up Walking a few
moments before shes jogging before shes running No
easy pace here Liza gets grim cranks up the speed and
goes hard Shes punishing herself

JERRY

His voice trails off as he watches Sad he lowers the
binoculars doesnt want to watch her do this Throwing
the CAR in GEAR he takes a last look and drives away

EXT NEW YORK NEWS - NIGHT

A classic corner newsstand except that a river runs down
the street and over the curb Newspaper stacks usually
on the sidewalk are up on milk crates The owner FLIP
TANNER cruises the sidewalk in a battered wheelchair
All sinew and tendons Flip is black about 50 He looks
to Jerrys cab plowing twin fountains as it approaches

Flip heaves a stack of newspapers and magazines into his
lap he rolls to meet Jerry at the curb hands him the
stack through the window Jerry looks down at the water

FLIP

KITCHEN - REFRIGERATOR

Locked Padlocked chains run through steel rings bolted
to the sides Jerry spins the combo-lock Before

INT JUSTICE DEPARTMENT - OUTSIDE CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
The morning meeting yet to begin Lawyers wait as
THROUGH the glass treadmill girl Liza Sutton argues with
brusque department head WILSON Its a screaming match
though on this side of the glass their VOICES are MUFFLED
THUMPS Liza waves her arms Wilson shakes his head
emphatically

As they continue to argue a YOUNG LAWYER arrives being
shown the ropes by an OLDER LAWYER

OLDER LAWYER
This is the conference room We
start 9 AM sharp Usually

The argument in the conference room has gotten so
vociferous that people have stopped pretending not to

A commotion down the hall Jerry The cop from
downstairs and a second one try everything short of
violence to usher him out

JERRY
Im an American and I demand to
see Liza Sutton

CONFERENCE ROOM

Wilson and Liza are nose-to-nose THROUGH the glass the
head of every lawyer turns from them to Jerry Like
deftly executed synchronized swimming Liza and Wilson
cant help but notice Jerry Liza shakes her head in
despair
WILSON

Liza crouches down on the floor behind the chair
LIZA

INT JUSTICE DEPARTMENT - LIZAS OFFICE - DAY

In its own way as cluttered and overflowing with files as
Jerrys apartment is At her desk Liza watches Jerry
pace The door is intentionally open Lizas secretary
JILL keeps a protective eye from the outer office
LIZA
I dont see the connection

JERRY
Come on Six major earthquakes in
the last three years The space
shuttle in orbit for every one of

them
LIZA
(incredulous)
Testing some top secret seismic
weapon
JERRY

Not testing Using Nukes are
passe This is the weapon of the
future

As Liza exchanges a look with Jill Jerry pauses to look
at a framed photo on a credenza

Liza 20 in full riding gear gracefully jumping a horse
over a set of rails

LIZA
I still dont see what it has to
do with the President

JERRY
(re photo)
Do you still ride

LIZA
Not for years

JERRY
So why do you keep the picture up
You wish you hadnt quit

LIZA
Well I -- Jerry the point Get
there What does it have to do
with the President

It takes him a moment to switch gears Setting down the
picture he pulls out a map unfolds it on Lizas desk
A seismic survey map He points as he talks

JERRY
The Presidents in Europe
Tomorrow hell be in Turkey
Right along this fault line They
launched the space shuttle
yesterday

LIZA
Motive

JERRY
Hes cutting funding for NASA
The milk cow of the aerospace
industry Were talking billions
Motive enough

LIZA
NASA is going to kill the
President of the United States
with an earthquake

JERRY
(nods)
Not exactly the kind of thing a
Secret Service Agent can throw
himself on top of

Liza sighs On another day Jerry might have been
welcome comic relief Not today As she folds his
map

JERRY
You going to warn him

LIZA
I cant promise you anything

JERRY
You think Im crazy

LIZA
I think youre different

JERRY

You know to be normal and live
in the real world to swallow
Coca cola and eat Kentucky Fried
Chicken you have to be ina

more I strip through the sham the
crazier I look to people like you
Cant you see thats what theyre
counting on

(a beat)
You want to go out sometime

Jerry smiles looks away embarrassed in an appealingly
boyish way If he wasnt crazy the answer might be yes

JERRY
I better get going
LIZA
You dont have to burst in here
every time Jerry Just call and
make an appointment

He nods gathers his map Halfway out he looks back

JERRY
What was your horses name

LIZA
Johnny Dancer
(a beat)
Youve been in my office ten
times How come you never asked
me about that picture before

JERRY
Was waiting till I knew you

Sounds like a racehorse

Jerry heads out Liza watches after him a beat as he
goes

EXT 40TH STREET AND 7TH AVENUE - DAY

Cordoned off with cops redirecting traffic A lake Big
diesel pumps gush water into the gutters and the
sidewalks are sandbagged All the same water flows over
Jerrys sneakers as he flags down a passing PUBLIC WORKS
GUY

JERRY
Hey dont water mains usually go
in the winter

DPW GUY
Summer winter all I know it its
beaucoup overtime

Something catches Jerrys eye -- a tan sedan parked
inside the cordon Official US Government plates As
Jerry frowns two suits CLARKE and PIPER exit the
subway kiosk head to the sedan Jerry watches then
heads for his cab

CUT TO

EXT FEDERAL BUILDING (MANHATTAN) - DAY

The sedan pulls up double parks As Piper and Clark
head inside Jerry pulls up across the street
INT FEDERAL BUILDING - LOBBY - DAY

Jerry enters watches Clark and Piper get on the elevator
for the 14th to 25th floors As the door closes Jerry
steps to a podium with a directory of the buildings
occupants He drops a finger onto a listing Floors 18
to 22 are occupied by the Central Intelligence Agency

JERRY
Spooks I knew it

LOBBY SURVEILLANCE CAMERA POV - JERRY

Grainy black and white as Jerry exits Is he being
watched

EXT DINER - DAY

Jerrys cab is reflected against the glass THROUGH the
window we see Jerry at the counter Standing he throws
a few bills down and exits

Jerry reappears in reflection stops short as Piper is
reflected on one side Clark on the other They grab
Jerry As he struggles Clark jams an air syringe against
his neck Jerrys reflection goes slack

As they drag him into his cab a single OLD MAN at the
counter looks over then back to his meatloaf as the
yellow of the cab streaks away

INT DECREPIT HOSPITAL ROOM (GERONIMO) - JERRY - DAY

Strapped to a chair in the middle of what looks like an
old hospital room Jerrys groggy starting to regain
consciousness As he comes round we hear FOOTSTEPS
APPROACHING from the hall

CLOSE ON JERRY

Two men enter They may or may not be Piper and Clark
but we only see their torsos as they move back and forth
We hear a CLOSET OPEN EQUIPMENT being DRAGGED Jerry
knows hes righteously fucked But he also knows

JERRY
I was right Wasnt I I was
right
(a beat)
What was I right about

They dont seem to pay him any mind
JERRY
Are you guys from NASA

Without warning one of the figures grabs Jerrys head
from behind straps it to a slat he attaches to the back
of the chair

Jerry struggles but his head is immobilized The second
man goes about taping Jerrys eyes open

JERRY
I was wrong I was wrong

Finished they leave Jerry struggles then finally
waits A new set of FOOTSTEPS in the hall Jerrys eyes
follow someone into the room and across from him Jerry
frowns

JERRY
Do I know you

JONAS (OS)
Yes you do Jerry Quite well

WIDEN to include --

JONAS

Standing opposite Jerry Genteel looking professorial
Theres something calm oddly soothing about him

JONAS
Have you ever been in a place from
which hope has gone All thats
left is patience Everywhere
Like a fog

A beat as Jonas considers Jerry

JONAS
Im a very patient man

JERRY
Thats great Good for you

JONAS
Who have you been talking to
Jerry Who else knows what you

know

JERRY
Could you be a little more
specific

Jonas doesnt answer Instead he methodically loads a
syringe Jerry watches with grave apprehension

JERRY
Whats that
JONAS
Lysergic acid diethylamide With

a little kicker of my own Surely
it must be coming back to you by
now

Theres nowhere to go but Jerry still tries to go there
as the needle descends And then the plunge

JERRY
What do I know

Jonas switches on a row of strobe lights They flash
into Jerrys face In between them on a screen images

JERRYS POV

A man on fire Kennedy with the waiter on the floor in
the Ambassador That guy in Vietnam being shot in the
side of the head Rhesus monkeys subjected to direct
brain stimulation Reagan catching it under the armpit
A slaughterhouse And interspersed between it all a
rather official-looking photo of a middle-aged man well
call Mr S Then --

JONAS
is dancing back and forth before Jerry The strobes
freeze him like some club from the 70s

ROOM

But Jonas isnt really dancing Hes directly across
from Jerry -- profile-to-profile

JONAS
Who else knows what you know

Slack-jawed Jerry doesnt answer Jonas holds an
electrode to Jerrys leg touches a second to his side
Jerry arches back as current flows

JERRYS POV

as the ceiling melts and drops in heavy globs around
them
ROOM
Jonas cuts the flow

JONAS
Who else knows what you know

Jerrys only answers are the tears running down his
cheeks Jonas hits him again

Jerry jerks back so hard the chair snaps right off the
floor and topples over backwards Jerrys left wrist and
right leg burst through the straps which were holding
them down A wisp of smoke rises

Jonas sighs He looks down at Jerry who moans
whispers

JERRY
Ill tell you

Jonas smiles paternally steps over Jerrys mouth
moves but we cant hear him Mr S flashes on the
screen

JONAS
(crouching)
From your lips to Gods ear

JERRYS POV

As Jonas leans in his nose looks enormous

ROOM

Grabbing Jonas shirt with his limited left hand Jerry
uses the only weapon hes got He bites Jonas on the
nose Blood pulses as Jerrys teeth find an artery
Howling Jonas tries to scramble out of reach

Jerry kicks him in the stomach with his free leg and then
keeps kicking Its inarticulate roughshod work but he
connects and Jonas feels it and each new kick as a

little more fury than the last

Finally Jonas rolls away Jerry half-crawls half-rocks
his way to a crouched position Rising he staggers into
the window the top of the chair smashing through the
glass Jerry stares down to the ground below

JERRYS POV

As the earth rises and falls like a wave The distance
down is impossible to gauge
ROOM

As Jonas staggers to his feet Piper and Clark charge in
They move forward but without warning Jerry gathers
what balance he has and heaves himself out the window
EXT SIDE OF BUILDING - DAY

Partially obscured by trees Jerry does a half-gainer
from exactly two stories above the ground The chair
back takes the brunt of the landing Wood splinters
ROOM

Blood spurts between Jonas fingers Clark and Piper
draw their guns and rush to the window

GROUND

Slats of wood hang at his elbows and knees as Jerry reels
across the lawn

ROOM

Clark and Piper FIRE

JONAS
Dont kill him Get him

As Clark and Piper rush off

EXT STREET - DAY

Jerry slogs sinks into asphalt up to his knees A truck
sets a dumpster down on the street ahead As it pulls
away Jerry dashes grabs hold of a handle on the rear

EXT STREET TWO - SOME BLOCKS AWAY - DAY

We see the truck approach As it turns right the
centrifugal force flings Jerry off the back and into the
oncoming lane Several taxis slam on their brakes to
keep from running him over

All Jerry sees is yellow

JERRY
Im one of you Im one of you
As one driver leans out one window shouts at him in
Hindu

where he clutches his side blood oozing out To his

face

LIZA

Jerry takes his hand from his side looks at the blood

JERRY
I didnt even feel it till a few
minutes ago

As Jerrys distracted one of the Cops moves in He
forces Jerrys gun hand up while the other two Cops take
him down Jerry struggles till one jams a thumb into a
pressure point in his neck Jerry winces collapses

JERRY
Who are they I dont even know
who they are But its on the tip
of my tongue

And Jerry starts to sob As Cop one cuffs him

LIZA
One of you call an ambulance

A hesitation before one of them moves to do so Liza
pushes her way through the other two

LIZA
Ease off of him

They back off a step keep him covered Jerry continues
to sob desolate And Liza despite herself puts an arm
around him does what she can to comfort Her lifes
never going to be the same

INT ROOSEVELT HOSPITAL - WAITING AREA - NIGHT

COP
(closing)
Put your damn foot down

Obliging Jerry swings his leg back over But he sets
his heel on a laundry cart shoves it hard into the Cop
It gives Jerry a chance to swing the bed rail into the
Cop whose gun skitters away as he tumbles back

Jerry tries again to jump down the laundry chute but the
Cop is there grapples with him Jerry finally head-
butts him As the Cop falls back releasing Jerry Jerry
falls down the chute He jerks to a stop as the bed rail
forms a crossbar over the mouth of the chute

against the other he inches his way up As he grips the
edge to get out a face looms Liza Jerry loses his

grip again drops jerks to another joint-wrenching stop

JONAS

lives

LIZA
Youve asked me that one three
times

JONAS

on me
Jonas

Jonas

Jonas

JONAS

LIZA
A year ago I was leaving work late
one night Two guys tried to mug
me It was horrible Jerry came
out of nowhere To my rescue
Then he started coming to see me
(smiles)
Couldve been a storybook if he
wasnt crazy At first I did my
beat to avoid him But theres
something inside Jerry and
(shrugs)
Jerry made me see it He made me
see him That make sense

continues

LIZA

over the edge wont hurt anyone
That sort of thing

Jonas takes a sip of tea watches her over the rim

Liza looks up as Agent Lowry enters

LOWRY
Thats the book Hinkley had on him
when he shot Reagan

LIZA
I was just thinking that

(leaning in)
You remember that Arab guy who
shot the Rabbi a few years back

over)
I was one of the arresting
officers He had a copy of the
goddamn thing too

(smiles)
You know that expression it must
be the water Well maybe its

As the Cop laughs it up Lowry and Liza exchange a look

LOWRY

The Cop shrugs exits Lowry picks up the keys and gum

an odd one

Of the three keys one is long and narrow

In one motion Jerry stands throws his chair through the
plate glass window As GLASS RAINS down hes already

As Jerry removes one of the stainless steel containers
Liza reads some of his magnetic poetry off the door

LIZA
Must language produce a thousand
knives and not recall a whisper

JERRY
Do you have a copy of that book I

Liza closes her eyes rubs them

LIZA

moments pass before we hear her front DOOR OPEN and then
CLOSE as Jerry leaves Lizas eyes flicker over to the
treadmill A moment and then

Fuck you too

Liza turns switches off the light

CUT TO

EXT STREET - OUTSIDE LIZAS BUILDING - NIGHT

A drizzle has started to fall For a street lined with
parked cars it has a rather desolate feel Theres a
certain car -- a Crown Victoria A silhouette behind the
wheel Lizas apartment is being watched

CROWN VICTORIA

Its Agent Lowry And in the back seat AGENT MURPHY
They sit in silence a relaxed practiced state of alert
Murphy frowns at the RAINDROPS which SPLAT the rear
window

MURPHY
Im gonna take a piss in the alley
before it starts to pour

Lowry nods keeps his eyes on the entrance to the
apartment Murphy opens the door As he climbs out of

the back seat we see a black 9mm in a shoulder harness

A few moments pass Agent Lowry leans forward to look up
to the dark window of Lizas apartment Behind him he
hearts the back door open Agent Murphy slide in the back
seat As Lowry leans back

LOWRY
Hows your bladder

The barrel of Murphys black 9mm is pressed squarely
against the side of Lowrys head

VOICE (OS)
Not bad
(cocks hammer)
Hows yours

Its Jerry in the back seat But Lowrys a pretty cool
customer He regards Jerry evenly in the rearview

LOWRY
Lot of folks are looking for you

Lowrys hand inches toward a 45 on the front seat
JERRY
Then you must be the smart one

Hands on the steering wheel

A little nudge of the 9mm and Lowry does as hes told

JERRY
Thank you

LOWRY
Youre welcome Wheres my
partner

JERRY

I like that A gun to your head
and you ask about your partner
Hes okay May have a headache
for a few days Are you here with
honorable intentions

LOWRY
Im not sure what you mean

JERRY
You should think of me as Liza
Suttons guardian angel

LOWRY
Thats ironic Because were here
to protect her from you

JERRY
Youre here because you figured I
might show up
LOWRY
It seemed like a possibility
What about your intentions Are
they honorable

JERRY
Im not a violent man Mr Lowry
Not by nature anyhow But if you
hurt Liza in any way Ill kill
you Does that seem honorable

LOWRY
Well I dont know if --

Jerry creases the back of his head with the gun barrel
As Lowry slumps unconscious Jerry starts out then
pauses

JERRY
Are you pretending

It sure doesnt seem so Till Jerry cocks back the
hammer

LOWRY
(all but motionless)
Yes

Jerry whacks him again Jerrys about to go when the
front door to Lizas building opens and Liza steps out in

her running gear

Jerry crouches but he neednt bother Shes not looking
his way As she takes off down the street

JERRY
Shit

Jerry pulls Lowry over to the passengers seat then
climbs into the drivers seat He starts the car then
rolls out after her

LIZA

runs Looks every inch the athlete as she moves Her
feet splash through the growing puddles as shes off the
curb and on the street

LIZA

cuts through a gap in the wall and enters Central Park

CROWN VICTORIA - JERRY

As he stops short Lowry slams into the dash He turns
rides along looking for a place to turn into the park
And then shes gone from sight Jerry abandons Lowry and
the car in the middle of the street and takes off on
foot

PARK - LIZA

Moving between the trees Elusive Tireless

PARK - JERRY

Gasping It takes everything hes got to keep her in
sight He strips off his jacket to lighten the load

As Liza exits the park continues on her way unaware
that behind her

Jerry collapses against the wall Taking each breath
like it was his last he watches as she disappears from
sight Finally as he staggers out of the park

EXT BARNES AND NOBLE - NIGHT
Jerry walks down the street reading

A popular area there are still quite a few people about
Suddenly the pages flutter in Jerrys hand Trash swirls
at his feet He stops slowly looks up as he hears the
HELICOPTER

Black no running lights equipped with a sound damper
It descends quickly over the intersection Silky black
cords drop Traffic snarls as CLEET COMMANDOS slide
down

Four of them Plainclothed with discreet com-headsets
Wearing jackets we catch glimpses of the equipment slung
on their hips including machine pistols Each has a 2X3
piece of paper taped to his wrist Like NFL quarterbacks
with the plays except the papers are photos of Jerry

The helicopter is gone so fast some people havent even
noticed The commandos disperse into the crowd refer to
their wrists as they advance in Jerrys direction

Jerry hightails it the opposite way tries not to

attract attention He pulls up in front of a movie
theater as a second chopper swoops in to drop four more
commandos at the south intersection The street has been
sealed off

Jerry stands there a beat not sure what to do

Something makes him look across the street where CLEET 1
pulls up looks over at him As CLEET 1 refers to his
wrist photo Jerry dashes into the theater

INT FLIGHT DECK - THIRD HELICOPTER - NIGHT

INT THEATER - NIGHT

Nearly a full house Jerry sits near the front
nervously looking back over his shoulder watching the
aisle

Four CLEETs appear silhouetted at the entrance As they
start down checking faces

As the manager drones people head for the aisles Jerry
moves for the emergency exit Sticking out like a sore
thumb as the emergency door opens and a shadowy figure
steps inside the alcove A CLEET commando

He spots Jerry starts forward
CLEET 3
(into com-set)

Hes in the third theater

Jerry starts back through whats been an orderly
proceeding

JERRY
Bomb Theres a bomb in here

As the cry of Bomb gets taken up panic spreads No
one gets trampled but the shoving is fierce As the
CLEETs fight their way down Jerry heads for the rear
exit A few other patrons go that way as well

EXT ALLEY - BEHIND THEATER

Jerry exits with a solid head-start but as he turns
theres a CLEET in the alley Checking faces -- not
looking Jerrys way yet Jerry keeps close behind
another patron then darts out swings the CLEET face
first into the wall

As the CLEET draws his machine-pistol Jerry slams his
face once twice into the wall As the CLEET drops
Jerry makes eye contact with a woman who watches aghast

JERRY
I didnt like his looks Did you

As she shakes her head no Jerry continues on his way

EXT THEATER - NIGHT

A big crowd As police cars pull up the CLEET commandos
exchange a look Removing their headsets they disperse
dissolving into the crowd like they were never even here

INT LIZAS APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT

experiments in sensory

deprivation

made the first The second is the POV of a room In
fact its entitled In My Room In the bg a
window Fg a sinister chair with straps hooks and
other exaggerated apparatus for keeping someone sitting
there Discarded macabre syringes litter the floor A

Franklin

Liza looks at the bill a moment shakes her head then
