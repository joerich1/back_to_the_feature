FADE IN
ABOVE A COUPLE

Curled into the classic spoon position deep asleep beneath
a pillowy down comforter We are

INT BEDROOM - DAWN

The digital alarm clock next to the bed reads 555 am We
can barely see the mans features by the early morning light
but this is NATE GOODMAN The sleeping woman next to him
is TARA OCONNOR We hear a faint BUZZING sound her
eyes POP open

Tara rolls away and pulls back the covers to reveal a pager
hooked to her underwear She scrambles to turn it off

Tara leans over the bed extracts a lighted mirror and
quickly applies some non-makeup-looking-makeup gulps a
travel-sized bottle of mouth wash swishes and realizes
theres no place to spit She grimaces swallows

Checking that Nate is still asleep she lies back down and
expertly draws a lock of bionde hair across her eyes Tara
is really pretty but leaves nothing to chance

The real ALARM sounds Nate rolls over and turns it off
facing Tara he watches her awaken He gently brushes the
hair out of her eyes We now see why she bothered he’s a
keeper

NATE
You always look so beautiful
especially in the morning

Tara smiles her thanks They begin to kiss
