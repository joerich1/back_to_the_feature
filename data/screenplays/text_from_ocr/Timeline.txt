e INT ITC CORPORATION -- DAY

JOHN GORDON a well-built man in his 40s strides down the hall
with a serious look on his face His bearing and gait suggest a
military background Gordon pushes open a door marked “Robert

Doniger Chairman” and walks past two secretaries without so much
as a nod

INT DCNIGER’S OFFICE -- DAY

ROBERT DONIGER 38 talks on the phone with his tennis-shoe clad
feet up on an enormous desk As a kid he got beaten up regularly
for being a geek The cheerleader he asked to his high school

prom laughed in his face As of llam this morning his net worth

was 63 billion dollars

Gordon enters and motions for Doniger to hang up Doniger puts
his hand over the receiver

McKinley Doctors couldn‘t figure out

what the hell was wrong His heart
kept stoppinghe was bleeding

internally So they did an yRI

Doniger shuts his eyes

GORDON
It showed the walls of his heart
werent lined up right Almost as if
it had been sliced into layers and put
back together only a tiny bit off
of course they promptly concluded
their MRI machine was broken

DONIGER )

Jesus We can’t let them do an
autopsy

Doniger thinks for a moment

DONIGER
Get the body He’s got no relatives
Weve got power of attorney Get the
body Tell them he’shis religion
requires that we bury him right away

GORDON
And if they balk

DONIGER
We gave McKinley two million dollars
last year They won‘t balk

CUT TO
EXT DORDOGNE RIVER VALLEY FRANCE -- DAWN

We look out over a large-scale archeological excavation of a
medieval town (CASTELGARD) Just beyond the excavation above
ground are the remains of monastery At the edge of the site
are several trailers

The sky is still mostly black In the east the black is just
giving way to deep blue and purple It’s 420 am And dead
Silent Not even the birds have begun to chirp

FIND a tent off by itself away from the trailers We hear
stirring -- and then a man emerges from inside His name is
ANDRE MAREK He is tall and strong He surveys the
stillness and quiet of the world around him and he seems pleased

SERIES OF SHOTS -- MAREK -- DAWN
Marek does a series of stretches then pushups and sit-ups

He walks among the ruins of the monastery The sky to the east
is a fiery orange now The sun is just below the horizon

INT KATE ERICSON’S TRAILER -- DAWN

KATE ERICSON lies in bed with CHRIS HUGHES Kate is attractive but not beautiful Chris could be a male
model Judging from the twisted sheets and the sweat on their
unclothed bodies they’ve been up for a-while

KATE
We can’t keep doing this

CHRIS
Why not

nearby He turns

10500

KATE
I feel so guilty every time

CHRIS
See now you need to talk to a shrink
about that

Theres a twinkle in Chris‘s eyes when he says things like that

KATE
(rolls her eyes)
I’ve got to get up

Kate is perpetually anxious Chris is perpetually laid back

CHRIS
The meeting isn’t for three hours

KATE
I have to get ready I have to
prepare for it

Chris suppresses a smile

KATE
What I have responsibilities You
dont take anything seriously

CHRIS
Not much
(innocent voice)
But I’m still young I’m finding
myself And thankfully I have an
older wisermore responsible woman
to show me the ropes

Chris is a complete smart-ass But he takes such glee in it you
cant help but like him Kate smiles shakes her head as she

walks to the shower

EXT SMALL HILL -- DAWN

Marek stands atop a small hill adjacent to the excavation site
and watches the sun rise

The moment is broken by the SOUND OF A GENERATOR kicking on
looks with disdain at the trailers behind him

A moment later a PIERCING ALARM CLOCK goes off in one of the
trailers He i i i

O EXT CASTELGARD EXCAVATION SITE -- MORNING

Kate makes her way to one of the pits She‘s wearing a gray
sweatshirt bearing the orange and black shield of Princeton

University

The pit is covered with a large tarp to protect both the
artifacts and lights and equipment underneath it Kate climbs
down the ladder and flips onthe switch to the generator It

CLANGS to life

VOICE
Ahhh Turn it off

Kate spins to see Marek

KATE
You scared the shit out of me Andre

MAREK
I hate the sound of that thing

KATE
What are you doing in here so early
C) Looking for someplace quiet

Kate flips off the generator

KATE
Sorry

MAREK
Its amazing how hard it is to find
that even out here You have to get
up at four am

Marek catches it

MAREK
Yes I saw Chris go into your trailer

Theres a flash of something in Kates eyes

KATE

Oh God

She‘s mortified

KATE
Oh God

Marek grins

10500

MAREK
(fucking with her)
Now technically youre his boss
right Or are you his teacher Is he
getting course credit for working on
this dig

KATE
Stop it Stop I’m so embarrassed
Oh I have to end it
(beat)
I was lonely and I just Don’t you
ever get lonelyeight months out
here
MAREK
All the time
(sees she’s taking
this really hard)
I’m not judging you Kate He‘s a
good-looking kid You guys like each
other There’s nothing wrong with
that And don’t worry -- I’m not
going to say anything

C) God if the Professor found out

MAREK
He will eventually Hell deal with
it

KATE
How come you never have anybody out
here I see the way women look at
you Plus you’ve got the accent
American girls love that

Marek smiles There is a breezy comfort between these two
almost as if they were brother and sister

MAREK

Im not very good at casual “4
relationships If I do it I tend to

do it all the way And I have to be

dragged into it Believe me

INT FIELD LABORATORY TRAILER -- DAY

PROFESSOR EDWARD JOHNSTON is 62 years old but he has the energy-
level of one of his undergraduates at Princeton He wears a
tweed jacket Even in the field Right now the Professor is
chatting with his technologist the good-natured if slightly
nerdy DANIEL STERN (30s)

STERN
The arches

Stern points to a topographic map of the site on the wall

THE PROFESSOR
The ones we think are from the
original monastery

STERN
Exactly I was able to date four
samples from the dirt around the
arches They came back around 1220
Which is before the original monastery
was even built right

A puzzled look on the Professors face

THE PROFESSOR
Yeahalmost 100 years before

A long pause And then a light bulb goes off

O

ou

10500

THE PROFESSOR
Wait a minute
(suddenly excited)
The soilis it mostly decayed wood

STERN
How did you know that

THE PROFESSOR
I love what I dé Dan I love it

EXT CASTELGARD EXCAVATION -- DAY

Graduate and undergraduate students work in various pits
FRANCOIS DONTELLE (early 20s) an undergraduate from the
University of Paris pokes his head out of one of the pits

FRANCOIS
Hey we found something Hey

MOMENT’S LATER
Marek makes his way down into Francois’s pit

MAREK
What is it

FRANCOIS
Youve got to see it for yourself Tf
can’t believe it

Francois leads Marek past several undergraduates to Chris who
shakes his head like he’s in complete disbelief He steps out

of the way to reveal a half-buried skeleton -- a skeleton wearing

a three- an eye patch and holding a
plastic pirate’s sword The students crack up
CHRIS
(through laughter)
I had no idea pirates made it so £
inland in France

Chris realizes that Marek isn’t even smiling
CHRIS
Come on Andre -- this might not rate

a full belly laugh from you but it
definitely rates a smile

MAREK
You just contaminated the site

CHRIS
Oh give me a break It was a joke

10500

Kate arrives
KATE
What’s going on

Marek points at the pirate skeleton Kate gives a half smile
but like Marek she hardly sees this as uproariously funny

MAREK
Anything that comes out of that site
that’s not from the right time period
calls everything else into question

Marek looks at Kate -- as if he expects her to weigh in as well

Chris looks to Kate too -- only he’s expecting her to give him
support

KATE
It just makes us look bad Like we
bend the rules for fun And if wed
bend them for fun then maybe wed
bend them for other reasons

CHRIS
You guys have no sense of humor
(beat)
For the record we documented the find
fully before we did this I’mnota
complete idiot

Chris hands her a roll of film anda detailed diagram -- then
walks away

INT PROFESSOR’S TRAILER -- DAY

The Professor’s desk is piled high with books and papers A
laptop is open connected to the internet Mar
with the Professor —

THE PROFESSOR
I know

He points at the pirate gear on a nearby table

THE PROFESSOR

I talked to him about it You two
‘were right to come down hard on him --

-- that’s your job as the site
managers But don’t worry too much
In the scheme of things it’s not that
big of a deal especially since theyd
already documented everything By the

ek and Kate stand

10800 lo

C) THE PROFESSOR (CONT’D) ‘
way I pulled almost the identical
stunt when I was on my first dig If
was 19 Except it was a Red Sox
uniform I think Chris knows that
story Anyway weve got bigger
more exciting fish to fry which Ill
tell you about at group meeting

EXT CASTELGARD EXCAVATION -- DAY
A grassy field with several pits around it The entire

excavation crew is here -- 15 people The Professor is
addressing them His Socratic instincts have already taken over

THE PROFESSOR
Who can tell me what happened on
November 1° 1380 Undergraduates
only

UNDERGRADUATE STUDENT
Siege of La Roque

ANOTHER UNDERGRADUATE
lon The day La Roque fell The day the
) French finally vanquished once and
for all the English laying claim to

land in this part of France

THE PROFESSOR

Excellent Tanya I see somebody
actually read the books you were
supposed to before you came here

(beat)
Who can tell me why the castle fell
The English army was three times the
size of the French one and yet the
castle still fell

Total silence

THE PROFESSOR
Come on people Nobody can tell me
why La Roque fell in that erucial
siege

Marek and Kate smile at the Professors method They know what
he’s about to say next

As

10500 i

THE PROFESSOR

Well that‘s good because nobody knows
One theory is that a secret passageway
into La Roque was built during the
castle’s original construction in the
early 1200s and that the French
finally discovered the passage on
November 1 1380 and used it to
surprise the defending English army
Most historians have discounted that
theory as far-fetched

(beat)
Not any more We just dated the
arches Kate and her crew uncovered
recently in Pit 3 They were built in
the early 1200s long before the
monastery above them Dan Stern did
tests on the soil there and he found
that it’s nearly 100 decomposed
timber Stone arches with a lot of
timber between them That smells like
a tunnel to me

The Professor tips his hat to Kate

THE PROFESSOR
Congratulations to Kate and her crew

The others give a quick round of applause

THE PROFESSOR
In other news at 2 pm I’m off to
the airport to go visit our
benefactor Mr Doniger in New
Mexico Any of you clowns need to see
me before Saturday you’ve got an hour

LATER -- EXT CASTELGARD EXCAVATION -- DAY

The meeting has broken up People are back in their pits
FIND Kate and Chris together out of earshot from the others

CHRIS
Youre going to publish a book on
this You’re going to get tenure
Youre going to be an academic star

Kate isn’t looking at him Shes looking at the ground Finally
she looks up at him

KATE
We have to stop seeing each other

CHRIS
What do you mean

O

ee

10500

KATE
I’m breaking up with you

That stops Chris cold The smile fades from his face
CHRIS
What Why

KATE
I’m eight years older than you
Youre my dissertation advisor’s
son You know why

Chris just stares back at her totally stunned

CHRIS
Step-son
KATE
You know what I mean It can’t

work

This is hard for Kate but she’s doing her very best not to show
it There is a long pause

KATE
Say something

CHRIS
(numb)
What’s there to say Youve obviously
already made up your mind Doesnt
seem like it was a very tortured
decision either

Chris Looks at her for a moment then turns and walks away He

looks

STAY ON KATE -- beat -- then tears well up in her eves
Whatever her mind is telling her her heart is clearly not in

this decision

cur TO

EXT PIT 1 -- DAY

A small handwritten sign on a wood post labels this pit

” Chris Francois and Marek have just
uncovered a large metal ax It ig dual-bladed with each blade
facing opposite directions Francois takes pictures and Marek
scribbles some quick notes in the log as Chris lifts the ax out
of the dirt Chris struggles with its weight

10500

CHRIS

You know the guy who invented this
thought he was a genius

(mock infomercial

voice)
“One blade gets dull no problem
Just turn this ax around and you can
keep chopping wood for another whole
week Peasants serfs even the log
cutter to the king can use this
Amazing Discovery” And all was well
in the kingdom -- for about two days -
- until some poor jackass went out to
chop wood

(demonstrating)
and promptly impaled himself in the
back with the spare side of his ax

Francois is laughing Marek is amused

CHRIS
By the way this thing weighs a
fricking ton

MAREK
Imagine swinging it with one arm
Thats how they did it

CHRIS
No way

MAREK
And this ax wasn’t used to chop wood
Tt was used to chop people During
battle Thats why it’s two sided
(beat)
Can you imagine the damage this thing
did

Marek pretends to be holding the ax He swings it back and forth
as if engaged in a fierce battle At the end he brings the
invisible ax up high and then down with all his might and a loud

grunt
MAREK
Yah

We get the sense that Marek’s imaginary foe has just died a
horrible death Chris looks over at Francois

CHRIS
(like a 15 year-old
would say it)
Psycho

fo

10500

EXT NEAR TRAILERS -- DAY

Chris and Marek clean the newly discovered battle ax on a work
table Marek notices that is is w i as she works
in the distance Shes obviously still very much on his mind

MAREK
Tf it means anything she’s taking it
pretty hard You want to talk about
it

CHRIS

Not really

EXT EXCAVATION -- DAY

Marek and Stern eat lunch outside Francois climbs out of the
“Castelgard Manor House” pit and walks towards them quickly

FRANCOIS
I think you should look at this

Marek eyes him suspiciously

FRANCOIS
Im not setting you up for a joke this
time Promise We just broke through
to some kind of underground chamber

EXT PIT 1 -- “CASTELGARD MANOR HOUSE’ -- DAY

Kate and Marek shine a flashlight through a three-foot wide hole
at the base of a freshly dug trench Through the hole they can
see a partially collapsed room

MAREK
Weve got to get inside fast If
there are any artifacts in there
theyre already getting destroyed

FRANCOIS
why

MAREK
It’s the first time they’ve been
exposed to outside air in 600 years
Paper cloth paint They all get
destroyed within a few hours

KATE
We go in there and the ceiling
collapses well get buried alive

10500

MAREK
eS You losing your nerve Kate

Thats all he has to say We see the expression on Kate’s face
change She’s going

SAME -- TWENTY MINUTES LATER

Kate and Marek are lowered with ropes through the hole in the
ground into the buried room They are outfitted with breathing
apparatuses head-mounted flashlights and two-way radios

INT BURIED CHAMBER

The ceiling is already partially collapsed in several places
Mounds of dirt cover the floor along with the remains of a
several pieces of burned furniture

KATE
What do you think

MAREK
This place burned to the ground

KATE
There’s nothing about that in the
historical record

Some dirt breaks loose around the ceiling -- pebbles fall then
dirt around it Kate and Marek spin to look at it They could
be buried Then it stops They both take deep breaths

MAREK
People like us make the historical
record Kate doing things like this

Kate spots a slight protrusion in a mound of earth It‘s surface
has a faint sheen She brushes it with her hand picks it up

KATE
Look Some sort of documents And
wrapped in oilcloth they just might
be intact
i

MAREK
Oh this is beautiful

KATE
Take them Get them up to Stern 50 he
ae can start preserving them

Marek takes the bundle of documents and walks toward the opening
On his way there he spots something shiny on the floor something
reflecting in the sunlight streaming through the hole

Rn

10500 16

MAREK
Wait a minute What the hell is
this

EXT EXCAVATION -- DAY

Kate and Marek are out of the chamber They pull Francois and
Chris over to a work table dut of earshot from the rest of the
group

Marek removes a cracked glass lens from his pouch He places it
on a work table then looks up at the two undergraduates as if he

expects a response
CHRIS
What

Chris and Kate avoid eye contact They‘re uncomfortable around
each other not sure how to act still in pain from the breakup

MAREK
We found it in the chamber

CHRIS
So

Marek looks into Chris’s eyes Then into Francois’s
MAREK
Guys this isn’t funny

CHRIS
What the hell are you talking about

KATE
You guys didn’t drop this in that -
hole
Chris and Francois look at each other then back at Kate and
Marek
MAREK
It’s a bifocal lens
CHRIS
Okay
KATE

Nobody’s been in that room for six
hundred years Except for you two

FRANCOIS
We didn’t go in

Senet

10500 17

CHRIS
Im missing your drift here Maybe
I’m stupid butwhat the fuck are you
two getting at

MAREK
Nobodys beer in that room since the
1300s

Cy

CHRIS
I heard that part

MAREK
Bifocals werent invented until 1785
And since this one says Bausch and
Lomb on the side I’m going to go out
on a limb and guess it’s even more
modern than that

INT WORK TRAILER -- DAY

Marek and Kate

KATE
Maybe the Professor put it in there
As a test of something

MAREK
How That hole wasn’t there until
this afternoon The Professors been
gone a day anda half

KATE
Maybe Chris and Francois found the
hole a few days ago Maybe they told
Professor Johnston and he decided to
test us--

pictures Before any documentation
The Professor would never do that

Marek looks at her Just then Daniel Stern approaches He
looks like he’s just seen a ghost

INT FIELD LABORATORY TRAILER -- DAY

Computers and scientific instruments cram the trailer Stern
points at the stack of parchment documents Kate and Marek
recovered from the underground chamber The oilcloth has been

removed and set aside

One by one They were tists of
what was stored in the room at various
times Nothing special nothing
unusual Thenat the bottom of the

disproved So I carbon-date the ink
Stern slides a white piece of paper across the table It reads

Marek looks at the piece of paper Stares at it Kate does too

STERN
I repeated the test three times

thathe wrote it 600 years ago

Your machine’s broken

STERN
If it were broken the date should
come up wildly different each time you

Yes

The group sits in a stunned silence

KATE

So the Professoryou’re saying--

More silence

DONIGER

Professor Johnston is right now in
the year 1357 somewhere in the

Dordogne Valley

He’s stuck there

He got separated from the people he
with Time ran out and they

went back
had to re

turn

KATE

This is some elaborate joke you and
the Professor cooked up isn’t it
You two are old friends from when you

were teaching at MIT

notorious

for--

DONIGER

The Professor’s

It’s not a joke Miss Ericson I’m —
hoping youll take a trip to the 1300s
to help us find him and get him back

here safe

How
possible

ly

MAREK
How does it work

DONIGER

How is it

The first thing you have to do to
understand anything in modern physics
is discard the notion that the way we
perceive the world through our senses
corresponds to ultimate reality

Cause it

Meaning

doesn’t
CHRIS

10500

DONIGER
Quantum mechanics says that a thing
can be in two places at the same time
String theory says there are eleven
dimensions not three Two years ago
physicists shot a beam of light into a
toom and recorded the fact that the
light beam left the room before it
entered

CHRIS
Huh
DONIGER

Exactly My point is simple in
physics things aren‘t what they seem
Not even close Even the most basic
ideas we use to make sense of the
world in every day life -- things like
“a cause has to oecur before it’s

‘effect’ -- get overturned pretty

quickly when you start studying what

the laws of nature really are
(beat)

Have any of you heard of a wormhole

before

KATE
In a Star Trek episode
MAREK
It’s like a trap-door in the cosmos

that leads directly to another time
and place

DONIGER
Yeah more or less Well they
exist We found the first one in
1999 Since then weve found eight
more Only one of them has remained
stable enough for us to traverse it on
a regular basis That particular
wormhole leads to the Dordogne River
valley in 1357 It wasn’t an accident
that I called my old friend Professor
Johnston two and a half years ago and
offered to fund a full-scale dig in
the Dordogne

KATE

Wormholes are predicted by string
oa theory but only at the sub-atomic

level Were talking billions of
times smaller than the head of pin
The idea that you could fit a human
being through them isit’s absurd

DONIGER
You can‘t fit a piece of paper through
a telephone wire either -- but you can
send a fax
The group stares back at Doniger What this man is saying is
erazy

CHRIS
He just wants to fax us back to the
14™ century Whats the big deal

STERN

This is mind-boggling Youre saying
you break us down into a stream of
electrons

DONIGER
oo EMC right Dr Stern You‘re a
oN physicist Energy and matter are just
NA two sides of the same coin Were
used to turning matter into energy
We do it all the time when we burn
gasoline or wood It’s a little
trickier to turn energy into matter
but weve figured out how That’s how
we reconstruct you on the other side
of the wormhole

DONIGER
Theories and explanation only go so
far You need to see this with your
own eyes In a few hours you will

The cabin is very quiet None of the students knows quite how
to react

Doniger leads the others towards the front door of the building
He limps slightly John Gordon is standing waiting for them
Along with another man Stephen Kramer ITC’s Chief Technologist

DONIGER
This is John Gordon Hes a retired
Army general He’s the number two man
here at ITC He led the trip back
with the Professor And this is
Stephen Kramer our Chief
Technologist

Gomez is ready to do the test-run if
you want to give them a demonstration

INT ITC CORPORATION -- DAY

Doniger leads the group through a double set of steel blast
doors Security cameras are mounted everywhere The group
moves into a an industrial-looking metal cage The doors close
behind them and the cage begins to descend

DONIGER
Were going down 1500 feet The
machines are at the base of an old
mine

O

STERN
That’s to shield the process from any
outside influences Radio waves
Stray electromagnetic interference

CHIEF TECHNOLOGIST
We don’t like taking any chances We
also use a great deal of water
shielding as youll see below

KATE
Why did you allow the Professor to go
back Why let him in on this secret
you‘ve been keeping from the whole
world There must have been a reason

Gordon looks at Doniger who nods granting Gordon permission to
explain

EBs

Doniger’s face is expressionless

10500

GORDON

This chip around my neck we call it a
“marker” It‘s like the key that we
use to open the wormhole and hold it
open when we’re in the past It’s
what allows us to recall the travel
devices and return home All the
second-generation markers have an

i i j i on them

DONIGER

The first generation markers which we
discontinued a month ago had no
expiration time

(holds up an old

chip double the

size of Gordons)
That means the old markers held the
wormhole open the whole time we were
in the past
markers three months ago I fell and
broke my leg and they rushed me back
to present day to get medical
treatment

(reveals shin cast)
At first we weren‘t particularly
worried about the marker It takes a
fingerprint ID to activate so we
werent worried about some medieval
peasant showing up in our transit room
or anything But there was something
we didn’t realize

MAREK
What

DONIGER
When a wormhole stays open for too
long it seems to allow energy to slip
from the present into the past
It’s difficult to explain but we
think if it keeps happening it could
cause changes to the earth’s climate

CHRIS
(wise-ass)
Like maybe another Ice Age or
something

DONIGER
Actually yes Thats what the models

predict
Hes dead serious

O

10500

FRANCOIS
Oh that’s nice That’s great

Theres a beat of silence while everyone takes this in

DONIGER

Of course as soon as we realized all
this we sent a team back to try to
recover the marker but they couldn’t
find it So we sent a second team
back with a tracking device The
tracker showed the open marker was
sitting inside the manor house at
Castelgard Somebody had obviously
picked it up Maybe they mistook it
for a piece of jewelry Who knows

GORDON
Thats why we needed help from the
Professor See wed never stepped
out into the world Wed never moved
more than a hundred yards from the
time machines And we knew that
without expertise in the social and
political environment of the day we
wouldn’t survive very long much less
be able to talk our way inside that
manor house to get near the open
marker

INT UNDERGROUND BUNKER -- TIME-TRAVEL LAUNCH AREA

The group exits the elevator and moves through a pair of massive
glass doors which are filled with water Then through a second
set of doors and into an enormous brightly lit cavernous space

They move out onto a metal passageway suspended fifty feet above
the floor Below them are a group of cage-like devices at the
center of a maze-like pattern of semi-circular water-filled

walls

KATE
Are those

Doniger nods The group looks down at the machines
KATE
Theyre not what I expected
MAREK
How did you lose the Professor
CHRIS

yeah that’s a pretty big screw up
don’t you think

10500

Doniger looks at Gordon who bristles

GORDON
The Professor decided the way to gain
access to the manor house was to pose
as a wealthy scholar on route to the
University at Bologna in Italy He
would say that his entourage was
attacked by robbers on the road and
ask for a day of hospitality He felt
our ignorance of medieval customs
would raise too many questions so he
asked us to stay hidden If anybody
discovered us we‘d claim to be
survivors from his entourage

CHRIS
So what happened

GORDON
He didn’t return Our markers were
about to expire We had to leave ©

MAREK
Are you sure he’s still alive

GORDON
The last time we saw the Professor he
was walking with the Lord Oliver the
English nobleman who controls
Castelgard They seemed to be having
a friendly conversation So I have to
believe the Professors still alive

Marek looks over at Kate

KATE
The history books say Oliver was a
pretty good guy He hada reputation
for hospitality and compassion

INT CONTROL BOOTH -- DAY

Jammed with computers The group looks down at the time machines
through thick glass windows

Two men in medieval garb step onto the transit floor below go to
the center of the maze structure and get into separate cages

CHIEF TECHNOLOGIST
Each machine can safely handle two
people but we always send everyone in
their own machine just to have ‘
redundancy in case of a malfunction

DONIGER
Gomez and Baretto are ex-marines The
two of them and John here will
accompany whoever travels back to help
us find the Professor

TECHNICIAN
Field buck

Doniger looks at a computer screen which shows an undulating
three-dimensional surface with a jagged upswing in the middle

STERN
Whats that

DONIGER

(physicist to physicist)
Because our field-sensing equipment is
so sensitive were able to detect
subtle discontinuities in the local
magnetic field We register them up
to two hours before an event It
means the machines are returning here

KATE
What machines

DONIGER
(pointing down at
Gomez and Baretto)
Theirs

KATE
Butthey havent left yet

DONIGER
I know It doesn’t make sense Look
quantum mechanics is just so
counterintuitive It’s like that beam
of light I was telling you about that
left the room before it entered the

room
Doniger sees that Gomez and Baretto are inside the cages They
give the thumbs-up The Chief Technologist gives them thumbs-up
back
CHIEF TECHNOLOGIST
Here we go

A dense array of green lasers fire toward the center of the time
machines putting dozens of green spots on the faces and bodies of

Gomez and Baretto The lasers then begin to rotate around the
two men making green horizontal streaks across their bodies The
10500

men stand motionless as the cages rotate rapidly around them --
spinning faster and faster ‘

The group jumps at a SUDDEN RAPID CHATTERING like a machine-gun

DONIGER
That’s the clearance check infrared
sensors verify the space around the
landing sight We need an open area
about the size of a basketball court
in order to safely land or take off
with the time machines

In the transit room a spinning ring descends from the top of each
machine

DONIGER
Now watch closely It’s fast

Deep violet lasers shoot out from a thousand points on the
machine The two ex-marines seem to glow white-hot for an
instant and then a burst of blinding white light flashes inside
the machine

Everyone covers their eyes for a momentand when they look back
they see that the machines are smaller -- they have pulled away
from the cables they were attached to at the top

Then another flash and another and another -- each time the
machine is smaller afterwards Within seconds the machine has
reduced to the size of a marble on the floor -- and then with
one final flash it disappears

KATE
Were supposed to do that

The group ‘stares in amazement

FRANCOIS
What does it feel like

DONIGER
Im not going to lie to you It’s
painful But the pain only lasts
three to four seconds

STERN
Have the machines ever malfunctioned
Has anybody ever--

DONIGER
Weve never had an injury in the
transmission process

room

STERN

DONIGER
Theyre coming back

STERN
Already

CHIEF TECHNOLOGIST
This was just a preliminary check To
make sure the wormhole is stable and
calibrate the landing site

With each rapid-fire flash the time machines grow larger The
group stares down at the transit floor in awe The flashes stop
A mist swirls around the two time machines Then the two ex-
marines step out of the machines and wave up to the control

booth

As the boy passes her he shoves her hard toward the woods
The rumbling has become distinct Men on horses Coming fast

Now everything happens with lightning speed Seven fully-armored
knights gallop into the clearing

(Note These are decidedly not “knights in shining armor’
Their armor is filthy and dented Misshapen from previous
battle And there is absolutely nothing “romantic’ or
“chivalrous” about them These men are vicious pitiless
soldiers)

Our group scatters toward the surrounding forest Gomez was
standing right where the knights entered the clearing though He
doesn’t have a chance The lead rider who wears a black plume
on his helmet draws his sword and swings it hard--

‘ i 2 i The fleeing body
literally keeps running a few more ghostly steps then it
collapses

Seeing all this from behind a nearby tree Kate gasps loudly--
Horrer fills her eyes

His time machine slides back into view in the clearing He
sprints for it pulling the pin on his greriade as he does

EXT FOREST -- DAWN

The fleeing boy rushes through the woods A knight on horseback
is in close pursuit

The boy runs into dense underbrush The knight follows slashing
at the tangle of foliage

On the other side of underbrush the boy emerges his clothes torn
by thorns

An instant later the knight emerges--
THUMP
A heavy tree branch swings out of nowhere and slams into the

chain-mailed torso of the knight -- sending the man flying
backward off his horse--

The boy spins to see this because he didn‘t swing the branch --
itwas Marek

The knight grunts as he hits the ground But he is up quickly
and he charges Marek with his sword held high

Marek dives out of the way of a ferocious swing of the sword
Then another Mareks only advantage is mobility With no
armor at all he can move faster than the knight -- but the —
knights sword moves like lightning

SWOOSH The blade misses Marek’s head by a fraction of an inch
Marek is thrown off balance and falls to the ground

The knight raises his sword for the death blow--

Marek sees the sword flash in the sun -- sees the blade coming
down -- his eyes widen -- and his right leg flashes out and clips
the knight in the knee

The knight falls sidewise and Marek springs towards him with the
speed of a coiled rattle snake

Next thing we know the knight is lying still Marek rolls off
the top of him ‘ i i
mans chin From the angle it’s a safe bet that the tip of the
dagger is well into the knights brain stem

life he has just saved

Only the boy’s torn clothes reveal

had been pulled back tightly before but crawling through the
underbrush has pulled it free It is shoulder length Dark

KATE
tr can’t believe it I’ve spent five
years trying to picture this place

MAREK

Dozens of villagers and soldiers seem to be leaving town with
livestock and other belongings It is not an orderly procession
and it’s not a frenzied exodus either It’s juse that everyone
seems to be leaving Several men stand outside the manor’
house loading a horse-drawn cart with framed paintings and rolled
tapestries

KATE
Where is everyone going

Kate Marek and the others all looking out at the stunning
sight of Castelgard are oblivious as several soldiers sneak in
behind them

MAREK
I can’t figure it out

The soldiers silently aim their crossbows at the backs of our
protagonists

Chris senses something and turns around His eyes go wide

CUT TO

EXT FIELD NEAR CASTELGARD -- MORNING

Chris Kate Marek Gordon and Francois are chained behind an
oxcart moving toward Castelgard They trudge through ankle deep
mud
CHRIS
(to Kate)

I thought you said the guy in charge

of this place had a reputation for

hospitality

Kate doesn’t say anything

FRANCOIS
Maybe this is medieval hospitality

SOLDIER
Be silent

The soldier hits Francois across the back with a long club He
spills forward into the mud Then he slams Chris repeatedly

until he falls too

KATE
Stop it Stop it

The soldier turns to Kate and threatens her with the club she
cowers from him

10500

Francois pulls himself up quickly Chris tries to get up but the
chains attached to his wrists pull him off balance before he can
stand He is dragged by his arms face down through the mud
The soldiers laugh

EXT MANOR HOUSE COURTYARD -- DAY

The house is fortified and surrounded by a heavy wall Marek
Chris Kate Francois and Gordon stand in chains in the

courtyard

A large strong man in his forties (LORD OLIVER) enters the
courtyard followed by several knights There are several
prominent scars on Olivers body This man is a warrior first
and foremost A man who has achieved his position by
ruthlessness and brute force not inheritance

LORD OLIVER
I am Lord Oliver Who speaks for you

MAREK
I do my Lord Andrew

LORD OLIVER

You speak strangely like another who
crossed my lands three days ago the
Irishman Edward de Johnes Do you
know of him

’ MAREK
He is my master sir Our caravan was
attacked by bandits

LORD OLIVER
So he told me

MAREK
You have provided him hospitality

LORD OLIVER
I have And he returned my
hospitality with insult

That catches Marek off guard He tries to hide his concern
Oliver scans the rest of Mareks groupfocusing on Francois

LORD OLIVER
Who is this one My soldier informs
me that he speaks with the accent of a
Frenchman

MAREK
Lord he is an interpreter we hired to
accompany us
10500

Oliver nodsthen thinks for a moment

LORD OLIVER
Lock them in the tower Except for
the Frenchman Kill him

MAREK
My Lord no He is valuable to us
Oliver draws a dagger and slits Francois’ throat

Chris gasps Marek’s eyes widen The group is in ‘shock

LORD OLIVER
Do not question my decisions

There is a brief choking gurgling sound then Francois collapses
in a bloody heap

ON CHRIS as he looks down at his best friend Francois eyes
close Chris can’t stand to look any more ‘

LORD OLIVER
(to Marek)
I am at war with the French Their
leader Arnaut has sent many spies
into my midst Perhaps you too are a

spy
Oliver touches the tip of his dagger to Marek’s neck Francois’
blood drips onto Mareks chest

CUT TO

A HEAVY WOODEN DOOR

om the outside letting in bright light Guards

It is opened fr
Chris and Gordon are

push Marek roughly into the room Kate
shoved in behind him “
The door slams shut When they look up they see the Professor--
He is speechless
KATE
Youre alive

PROFESSOR JOHNSTON
II’mWhy are You here

GORDON
We asked them to help us find you

Chris hugs his step-father

10500 2

OO

CHRIS
It hasn‘t worked out quite the way
they planned Francoiss dead So
are two marines who were escorting us

PROFESSOR JOHNSTON
Francois How

MAREK
Oliver killed him because he had a
French accent
(beat)
I’m the one who convinced him to come
back with us

Marek is clearly broken up with guilt

KATE
It‘s not your fault Andre

MAREK
Noit is It is I told him we
needed a French speaker and

KATE
Andre
(to the Professor)
“ Olivers not exactly the man the
history books make him out to be

PROFESSOR JOHNSTON
No

GORDON
What happened Why didn’t you come
back to meet us

PROFESSOR JOHNSTON
Oliver put me under house arrest
GORDON
Why

PROFESSOR JOHNSTON
I told him I was a scientist on my way
to Bologna like we talked about He 7
was suspicious He thinks everyones
a French spy So he asked me to
demonstrate my skills I used one of
the fire-starting cubes That was a
mistake From then on he saw me as
useful Tried to draft me into
service as a military engineer If
said I had to leave He said “no” and
put me under guard

tee
10500

Marek glances out the narrow slot windows of the tower He can
see the town of Castelgard is almost abandoned now Dozens of

peasants craftsmen and soldiers make their way out toward the
orest

MAREK
Why the exodus Is Arnaut planning an
attack

PROFESSOR JOHNSTON
Tonight Oliver’s moving everything
to La Roque to prepare for a siege
The French already control most of the
countryside and the monastery

Gordon has pulled out his St George locket and opened it The
high-tech tracker inside reveals that the open marker is close
by though not within the fifty feet target area that would allow
it to be remotely destroyed ‘

GORDON
The open marker is close It‘s almost
in range

PROFESSOR JOHNSTON
I dont care about the marker anymore
I just want to get us out of this
place Do you understand me Doniger
can send back another team to get the
marker later It’s his problem

KATE
points out window)
Closest place with enough room to
recall the time machines is that field
out there past the outer wall

GORDON
It’s getting there thats the problen

Marek checks the marker around his neck When he holds his thumb

on the back of the marker a tiny digital countdown fades up
beneath the opaque white area atop the marker It reads

130709

MAREK
Weve got thirteen hours left

CHRIS
We should be able to figure a way out
of here by then Were from the 21°
century Weve got 650 years of
knowledge on these bastards

10500 54

GORDON
We may be from the 21° century but
were still locked in a tower sixty
feet off the ground There are three
guards outside

THE PROFESSOR
What about the disabling spray

GORDON
Guards took everything in our leather
pouches took our daggers

Through the window Marek sees a woman dragged into the courtyard
by the knight we saw earlier with the black plume on his helmet
Black Plume thrusts the woman in front of Lord Oliver

MAREK
It’s her

It’s the French woman Marek helped this morning the woman who
was dressed like a boy

She stands before Oliver a defiant look in her eye
Oliver hits her across the face so hard she falls over

Marek is enraged by the sight His compatriots have now crowded
around the window as well

Down in the courtyard the French woman pulls herself up and
stands before him again still defiant

LORD OLIVER
You French are such proud people

FRENCH WOMAN
Yes So you should know that my
brother will never bargain with an
English dog like you -- even for my
life

Oliver hits her again She topples over

Oliver is well over six feet tall This woman might be five foot
four And he is hitting her full force

LORD OLIVER
Your life is not the only thing that
can be taken from you woman

Oliver turns to the knight with the black plume

LORD OLIVER
Bring her to my chambers

THE PROFESSOR
I don’t know
Marek watches the French woman get dragged off He can’t take
his eye off her He can’t stand whats happening to her
In the meantime Kate is standing at the window closest to the
door She reaches her hand out to feel the stones and the mortar
on the outside
KATE

KATE

CHRIS
On a gym wall with a safety line

French woman to see what the others are talking about

and pins him to the oak door (These bows are designed to fire
300 yards Marek let that one fly from about twenty feet)

The guard looks at him in shock

Marek Looks back shrugs as if to say “I geld you so” The
guard falls to the floor

Marek reaches down and searches for the mans keys He can hear
the footsteps of approaching guards

He spins to see a knight running around the corner at the other
end of the hall -- the knight with the black plume Marek raises

his bow -- lets an arrow fly

Black Plume dives to the floor

Marek loads another -- lets it fly Whoosh
‘Black Plume hugs the floor starts packing up now
Marek shoots another arrow down the long hall

Black Plume ducks back around the corner

Marek goes to the oak door Reaches into the pocket of the dead

a and removes a set of keys Unlocks the door and enters
Three feet in front of him is a heavy velvet curtain (a draft
protector) He pulis it open to see

Lord Oliver’s bed chambers
