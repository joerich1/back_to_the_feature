BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE EID

William Goldman

FINAL
Taly 15 1968

Not that it matters

but what follows is true

BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID

FADE IN ON
ALMOST THE ENTIRE SCREEN IN BLACK SHADOW

The upper right corner is the only color and that is a
white that almost stings to look at it -- it is the white
heat of the afternoon sun and the shadow we come to
realize is the side of some building together with the
shadow of that building on the ground If we dont know
quite what it is that were seeing at this point thats
all right CAMERA HOLDS ON THE SHOT after a moment the
shadow of a man begins to fill the upper right corner

As the shadow lengthens

cuT TO
A MAN

idly walking around a corner of the building He is
BUTCH CASSIDY and hard to pin down Thirty-five and bright

he has brown hair but most people if asked to describe

him would remember him blond He speaks well and quickly
and has been all his life a leader of men but 1f you asked
him he would be damned if he could tell you why

BUTCH
stopping by a window giving it a glance
cur To
THE WINDOW
It is heavily and magnificently barred
cur TO

BUTCH

scowling briefly at the bars He moves in toward the
window to look through and as he does there begins a
series of very quick cuts (Butch it might be noted

here is casing the bank and what he is doing as his

eyes flick from place to place inside is probing the place
for weaknesses But if we dont know quite what it is thaw
hes doing et this point thats all right too)

TSE DOOR OF A BIG SAFE

It is behind shining bars and it is the kind of safe that

cur TO
BUTCH

eyes expertly flicking from place to place Then he starts
to walk around the bank again and he isnt happy

CUT TO
A BANK GUARD

It is closing time now and he is slamming metal plates into
place the sound loud and sharp and final The CAMERA
PULLS BACK TO REVEAL Butch watching the GUARD work

BUTCH
What was the matter with that old
bank this town used to have It was
beautiful

GUARD
(continuing to slam
things shut)
People kept robbing it

cur TO

BUTCH

who starts to walk away across the street toward a barn

-of a building with a sign outside Macons Saloon In

the middle of the street he turns and stares back at the
bank It is new and ugly and squat and functional
and built like a tank

cur TO
CLOSEUP - BUTCH

BUTCH
(yelling back to
the guard)
Thats a small price to pay for
beauty

And from this CLOSSUP of Butch -

DISSOLVE TO
CLOSEUP A MUSTACEED MAN
PULL BACK TO REVEAL Macons saloon It is a barn of a
place without much decoration and it is all but empty
now giving an even greater impression of size Almost
the only action in the place comes from a game of black-
jack in which the MUSTACHED MAN is dealing (There are
other tables set up ready for play chips and cards
neatly placed but this is afternoon now the sun slants
in through windows and the other tables are empty)

cuUT TO

The Mustached Man flicks a card

He pushes back from the table Hesitates Then --

PLAYER
Gimme credit Mr Macon

CUT TO
17 JOHN MACON

He is a well-dressed good-looking man in a big rugged
way Not yet thirty he gives the strong impression of
power and maturity -- he has come a long way through a
tough world and he has come fast He is a man who at all
times knows wherecf he speaks

MACON
(shaking his
head tno)
You know my rules Tom

He turns now looks at the Mustached Man

MACON AND THE MUSTACHED MAN

The Mustached Man deals quickly with no excess motion
-The betting and the flicking out of the cards goes fast

MACON

card)

To repeat while these quick cuts take place (and if we

camera returns constantly to the Mustached Man in closeup
with Butch beside him moving in and out both of them
talking fast

BUTCH

MUSTACHED MAN

MAIN TITLE SEQUENCE

This is a series of shots which for the first time
really open up the story visually Up until now the
scenes have been “western” but they havent attempted

to include any of that incredible feeling of awesome

size this kind of picture ought honestly to have Now

in this series of cuts -- some with Butch and Sundance
riding some without -- we get it all There isa
feeling of time passing of distance of changing terrain
all of it leading to the culminating shots when the credits
end and the effect by then should be considerable for
by then we will be at Hole-in-the-Wall A list of shots
might include

CLOUDS

are fluffy and they hang there in the sky and pull

curt TO
BUTCH AND SUNDANCE

riding As they move along several of the cliffs behind
them become momentarily visible which is of interest for
only one reason the eliffs are filled with caves and
every so often an armed lookout appears from a cave and
signals and Butch without ever preaking the rhytm of
his speech signals back

BUTCH

MUSICAL INTERLUDE NUMBER ONE

There are going to be three of them before the film is over
This the first is a song sung while Butch and Etta ride
the bike The song will be sung by male voices and the
feel of it is terribly contemporary because in fact tne

‘sound of the songs of this period are shockingly close in

feel to the popular music of today

What we hear will not be a song like Bieycle Built for Two”
The song will be poignant and pretty as nell and like ‘che
songs for example in ‘The Graduate” they will make an
emotional comment on the scene not a literal one they

will have an emotional connection with the scene not a
literal one

CAMERA STAYS on the Bandits and in the next sixty seconds
the action FREEZES sixty times and the first SOUND that

Sundances bullets thud home and from left to right the
Bandits start to die And the left to right move is the
first move the CAMERA makes PANNING across the dying
men some of them with their gums still in their holsters
and then as the gunfire ends another sound begins just
as loud and just as terrifying and this sound is a scream
It doesnt come from any one bandit it isnt even con-
nected in any actual way with amy one man but it is the
loudest scream anyone ever heard and it peaks almost im-

mediately and then it really starts to build as the blood

starts pouring from the Bandits from their chests mouths
eyes And once the left to right move is over THE CAMERA
BEGINS ITS SECOND MOVE and the direction of the second
move is down as gradually the Bandits no longer able
to stand start slipping gracelessly to earth hd every
second the action freezes them in their final trip and
the scream keeps them company and even though the trip

is short it still takes time for all six to slip and
stagger and crumble awkwardly to their kmees and beyond
toppling sideways and backwards and forwards but always
down colliding finally with the hard earth which is red
now with their blood as it leaves their dying bodies and
as the scream ends the blood continues to drain cease-
lessly into the ground
