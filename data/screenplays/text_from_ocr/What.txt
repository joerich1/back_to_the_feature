For main title end exposure of credits there is a
packground of carousel music The series of quick
dissolves shows trick shots of each of the principal
characters in the story It is as though they are
riding a gigantic merry-go-round Doubleexposures
show a background formed by various Hollywood places
photographic studies of Hollywood In the foreground
4s each character riding on merry-go-round animal
The only character not on a horse camel etc is
the girl Mary Evans She too is on the Hollywood
Merry-Go-Round but she is riding in a Cinderella
pumpkin coach with two rats for horses

CAROUSEL MUSIC (Some established tune that
keeps the mood of the picture such
as Im Forever Blowing Bubbles)

(Note If desired the name of each character may
be used superimposed on the scene depicting the
persons pertinent to the play thus introducing them)

reads the letter He takes his cane like a
sword He is not stooped now He is the
great general who is left behind Tf
