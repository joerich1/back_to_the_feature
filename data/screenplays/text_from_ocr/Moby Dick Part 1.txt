MOBY DICK

PART ONE

ACT 1
TITLES OVER
EXT NANTUCKET HEADLANDS - EVENING

Majestic black cliffs tower over the rocky coastline of
the Atlantic seaboard A stormy winter sky Dwarfed by
this mighty vista a speck of a man descends toward the
grey vastness of the ocean

EXT NANTUCKET SHORELINE - EVENING

Powerful waves crash against coastal rocks ISHMAEL

(late 20s) an inquisitive young man with an amiable intelligent
face ventures along a beachside trail

against the beating wind toting a small satchel

EXT NANTUCKET -EVENING

An 1850s whaling seaport Muddy streets and an old
rain-slicked dock A cold stark unforgiving place
Tall-masted ships sway beside the dock wind buffeting
their furled rigging In bg a glimpse of a dramatic
sunset between darkening thunderheads

EXT DOCKSIDE SHEDS - EVENING

THREE NANTUCKET WOMEN in dark clothes and shawls collect baskets
from a storage shed their faces etched by years

of hardship and woe A look of widows about them

Ishmael passes before them and we follow him through

a clutter of barrels and ship refuse into town

EXT NANTUCKET STREET - EVENING

A short block of brick houses and taverns A FEW PEOPLE
scurry about hugging buildings to escape the storm
Ishmael bundles along the sidewalk drawn to the warm
glow of oil lamps behind thick-paned windows

Across the street ELIJAH a stooped scrawny old man

wrapped in a tattered oilskin cape watches Ishmael with
demented eyes muttering to himself

Ishmael pauses under a tavern sign with a harpoon crucifix THE
CROSSED HARPOONS He peers through the window

INT THE CROSSED HARPOONS -EVENING

Shabby but lively a loud revelry in progress

EXT NANTUCKET STREET -EVENING

As Ishmael looks in the tavern door swings open A
jovial barrel-chested man (STUBB) clamors out with
TWO DOXIES in each arm laughing spiritedly Ishmael
backs up against the window to steer clear Stubb and
his prostitutes bustle off into the stormy night

Ishmael considers the tavern and digs out a few meager
coins from his pocket Someone distracts him

Crazy old Elijah eyeballs him from across the street

Ishmael reacts and protectively pockets his coins He
moves on

A short distance further another tavern with a sign
overhead swinging in the wind THE SPOUTER-INN
PETER COFFIN PROPRIETOR Ishmael glances through
the window

INT SPOUTER INN - EVENING

Shabbier than the last inn poorly lit

EXT NANTUCKET STREET - EVENING

Ishmael nods to himself Perfect He steps inside
as lightning flashes and thunder CRACKS behind him

Elijah suddenly appears at the window the lightning
reflecting his wild eyes Staring inside he licks his

lips for want of a drink then wraps his cape around

himself to stave off the windy chill He wanders off babbling
incoherently

INT SPOUTER INN -EVENING

A deserted anteroom VOICES drift in from a rear dining
room its doorway framed by a huge whale jawbone

Ishmael drops his satchel removes his coat and hangs it

on a rack He stops to notice a painting on a dark wall
Trying to make out its massive center image Ishmael draws closer
to focus on the eye of a mammoth sperm whale

A terrifying depiction of a monstrous leviathan leaping
over a ships tall masts

Ishmael is transfixed by it A voice startles him

COFFIN (0S)
Goin to sea are ye

PETER COFFIN the stout tavern owner appears in the
jawbone doorway and looks him over amusedly Ishmael
smiles eagerly and steps over to the inn counter

ISHMAEL
Aye that I am

Moving behind the counter Coffin turns the registration
book around takes a pen and dips it into an inkwell

COFFIN
Ships mate I suppose

ISHMAEL
No

He takes the pen and signs his name Coffin watching him

COFFIN
A passenger then

ISHMAEL
Not very likely A passenger
needs a wallet and thats
just a slice of leather when
theres nothing in it

COFFIN
A commodore then Or a cook

Ishmael laughs As if echoing him a GUST OF LAUGHTER
blows in from the dining room

ISHMAEL
No a simple sailor jumping
from spar to spar like a
grasshopper in a May meadow
like a slave you might say
but who isnt a slave Tell

me that

COFFIN
I suppose then youre goin
whalin

ISHMAEL

Aye Might ye have a room
then for a simple sailor
MisterCoffin is it

COFFIN
Aye If ye got no objection
to sharin a blanket with a
simple harpooner

ISHMAEL
Harpooner WellId rather
put up with half any decent
mans blanket than wander
further on so bitter a night

Another GALE OF LAUGHTER from the dining area Ishmael
peers curiously around the counter to see the doorway

A room filled with bawdy gruff-looking men Standing
close by the doorway is FLASK a short pugnacious
mariner in a restless mood

ISHMAEL (contd)
Could that be him sir The
harpooner you mentioned

COFFIN
Nothats Mister Flask
with the rest of the Grampus
crew Just landed lLiquors
already gone to their heads

Flask quickly takes his leave and crosses the anteroom
toward the front door Coffin chuckles at him

COFFIN (contd)
Off lookin to board another
ship are ye Flask

Flask nods with a haughty sneer glancing over Ishmael
He swaggers out without a word

COFFIN (contd)
Well thats that As I
expected Hes already sick
of solid ground Burns his
feet it does Firm land
I mean

INT SPOUTER INN HALLWAY -EVENING

Oil lamp in hand Coffin leads Ishmael through a narrow
twisty corridor of labyrinthine turns and steps

Up three steps and down around a corner and over another
set of steps passing dim-lit doors Coffin walks fast Ishmael
struggling to keep up As they pass one door

A giggling half-naked girl (one of Stubbs Doxies)
spills out Stubb yanks her back inside slams the door

Ishmael pauses to look back puzzling over their MUFFLED LAUGHTER
Coffin glances back with a chortle

COFFIN
That Mister Stubb aint seen
a skirt in narry two years
(waves him on)
Step lively lad I havent
got all night

INT SPOUTER INN ROOM -EVENING

The door opens into a dark room with sparse furnishings
and a modest-sized bed Coffin lights an oil lamp

COFFIN
This whale oils gettin a
bit low Id best refill
it tomorrow

Ishmael regards the bed ambivalently

ISHMAEL
Seems a trifle small for two
grown men

COFFIN
Well if youre goin to go
whalin ye better get used
to that sort of thing Why
look at that bed Its the
largest one in the house
Sal and me slept in that bed
the night we were spliced
Plenty of room

ISHMAEL
Mind ye Im not complaining
Mister CoffinId just like
to know what kind of man Id
be sharing it with

COFFIN
Well its almost Sunday
That harpooner likely anchored
somewhere else for the night
Make yerself comfortable
Misterwhats yer name

Ishmael turns an innocent smile

ISHMAEL
Call meIshmael

Coffin nods and exits closing the door behind him
Ishmael gazes around the room In a corner sits a
giant sea chest with mysterious painted designs
Pondering it Ishmael takes off his boots and pants
crawls under the beds blanket and leans toward the
bedside oil lamp He blows it out

EXT CAPTAIN AHABS HOME -NIGHT

Lightning illuminates a two-story brick house on the
outskirts of town Lamplights burn behind the windows
of both floors

Passing before the second-floor light a mans shadow
paces back and forth with feverish intensity

INT CAPTAIN AHABS HOME -NIGHT

A lamp casts a shuddery glow over a pale haggard
woman (AHABS WIFE) who sits before the dying embers
of a hearth wrapped in a woolen shawl Close beside
her sits a timid 12-year-old boy (AHABS SON)
slight of build with an angelic face

Eyes turned to the ceiling both listen apprehensively
to a METHODIC DRY THUNK on the wood floor upstairs
pacing relentlesslythe FOOTFALLS OF A PEG LEG

A LOUD KNOCK at the door -- the two jump out of their
skins Upstairs the PACING STOPS Unmoving the Wife
stares at the door A tense beat

Another UNSETTLING KNOCK The Wife nervously fingers
her shawl The Son sits rigidly Both waiting

ANGLE ON a staircase the top half blocked from view
by a wooden overhang From the top of the stairs a
steady THUNK-CLOP THUNK-CLOP Finally a foot steps
down into viewthen a white whale-bone peg leg It
descends slowly and painfully as we see elaborate
leather straps connecting it to a severed thigh

The Wife and Son watch with fear mesmerized

On the staircase a mans chest lowers into view
then the face of CAPTAIN AHAB A face of fury and
power molded in bronze eyes black as night

A long white scar streaks down from his bald crown
to his collar A fierce visage set in granite

A third BOOMING KNOCK at the door Ahab glances
at his wife and child his expression unchanged
The anxious-faced Wife trembles

Dragging his peg leg to the door with agonizing
THUNKS Ahab opens it into the night

An icy GUST sweeps inside -- the lamp flickers out
cinder sparks fly from the hearth
Silhouetted against the harsh storm FIVE GHOSTLY

FIGURES fill the doorway Their faces unseen one
with a turbaned head A lightning flash gives us

a quick glimpse -- sinister demonic Arab faces

EXT NANTUCKET STREET -LATE NIGHT

Few lights are still burning the storm died down
The street is obscured by fog

A tall figure (QUEEQUEG) looms in the fog carrying
a lethal-looking harpoon like a shepherds staff
He struts his way toward the Spouter Inn

INT SPOUTER INN ROOM -LATE NIGHT

In bed Ishmael arouses from deep slumber sensing
something Then he settles back to sleep

INT SPOUTER INN HALLWAY - LATE NIGHT

Viewed from Ishmaels door the tall ominous figure
lumbers down the dark hall toward us

INT SPOUTER INN ROOM - LATE NIGHT

Ishmael is startled awake by a LOUD CREAK of the door
He peeks out of the covers

The tall figure enters and leans his immense harpoon
gently against a wall as if it were delicate china
He lights a small candle on a dresser

A dark-skinned Polynesian Queequegs clean-shaved face

is covered with strange exotic tattoos His face is
ferocious-looking and yet tranquil almost innocent in character
He pulls a satchel off his shoulder opens

it and takes out what vaguely resembles a dolls head

Obscure in the dim light Ishmael watches in awe
Its a shrunken human head Queequeg lifts it up to
the candlelight and chants some indecipherable words

to it

Ishmael stares warily from his covers
Queequeg abruptly stops his invocation stuffs the head
back into his satchel and moves the candle to the bedside
table He quickly undresses

Ishmael cant take his eyes off the muscular tattooed
body -- as Queequeg leaps into the bed beside him

Still unaware of Ishmaels presence Queequeg produces
a long tomahawk pipe leans toward the candle lights
the pipe and sits back in bed puffing serenely

He rests his free hand down next to himdirectly onto Ishmaels
face

Ishmael stiffens with fear Queequeg freezes Ishmael
tries to jump out of bed -- but Queequeg grabs him by his
nightshirt collar and firmly holds him down He deftly
wields his tomahawk its blade against Ishmaels throat

QUEEQUEG
Who de debel is you You
dont speak up I kill-e

Ishmael gapes up in strangled terror gasping

ISHMAEL
(cries out)
Landlord Mister Coffin

Queequegs frown tightens though somehow more curious
than angry He presses the blade of the tomahawk harder against
Ishmaels throat and growls

QUEEQUEG
Speak Tell-ee me who ye be
or dam-me I kill-ee

The door to the room flies open Coffin steps quickly
inside An amused smile as he feigns concern

COFFIN
Look here Queequeg stop
that

Queequeg turns his attention to Coffin just long enough
for Ishmael to wriggle away Ishmael scrambles out of

the bed outraged to Coffin

ISHMAEL

Why didnt you tell me this
harpooner Im sharing a bed
with is a bleedin CANNIBAL
for Christs sake

Coffin pays no attention to Ishmael as he faces Queequeg

COFFIN
Queequeg listen to meyou
sabbee me I sabbee you no

Queequeg nods thoughtfully He lights his tomahawk pipe
smoke enveloping his tattooed face

COFFIN
This man sleep here in this
bed With you you sabbee

Queequeg nods again He looks at Ishmael who stares
with open dismay at this immense Polynesian harpooner

QUEEQUEG
Me sabbee plenty
(points at Ishmael)
You get-ee in

Ishmael glances at Coffin who grins and nods at the
bed Queequeg smiling good-heartedly hands his pipe
to Ishmael Hesitating but more relaxed Ishmael takes
it and draws a mouthful of smoke And promptly gags
Tears and coughing Queequeg laughs loud and hard

EXT NANTUCKET HARBOR DOCK -LATE NIGHT

The storm over the harbor is silent and deathly still
The dock is dense with fog

Amidst a dockside rubble of discarded sails old Elijah
half-sleeps fitfully huddled under a filthy sailcloth covered
in frost

GROUPED FOOTSTEPS startles him wide awake Among them
the unmistakable SOUND of a PEG LEG STRIKING STONE
Elijah stares out with troubled dread

Like apparitions of the night six dark shapes materialize
out of the fog and march toward a docked three-masted

whaling ship The Pequod They strut inexorably up the gangplank
their central figures STEPS bold and clear THUNK-CLOP
THUNK-CLOP

FADE OUT

ACT 2
INT SPOUTER INN ROOM -MORNING

Cold sunlight peeks into the room from the only window Queequeg
sleeps his arm wrapped around Ishmaels chest Ishmael lies
awake immobilized by Queequegs unconscious embrace

ISHMAEL
Queequeg

A loud snore Ishmael puts some serious effort into trying
to liberate himself to no avail

ISHMAEL (contd)
(louder )
Queequegwake up ye big
savage oaf In the name of
goodnessWAKE UP

He writhes pushes and strains his way free of the giant harpooner
who slowly wakes Ishmael drops his feet to
the floor and shakes his head To himself

ISHMAEL (contd)
Must be dreamin of his savage
wife back in whatever savage
place he escaped from

Queequegs eyes open He grins at Ishmael yawns and
leaps out of bed with amazing agility

ISHMAEL (contd)
Good morning to ye too big
king of the typhoon snore
Ishmael stares with bewilderment at his brown torso
covered with tattoos from head to toe Queequegs grin
is friendly as though he were used to being gawked at

INT SPOUTER INN DINING ROOM -MORNING

A vast platter of steaming steaks is plopped down on a

large table by a stout red-faced woman SAL COFFIN

As soon as the platter is on the table the sharp
spear of a harpoon stabs a fat cut of bloody red meat
Queequeg transfers the steak to his plate with quiet
ceremony the entire maneuver performed with exquisite gentleness
and good manners Setting aside his harpoon

on the floor he digs in

Ishmael watches him baffled The rest of the men
dont seem to have noticed anything unusual They
reach for meat and bread far less politely and
noisily chow down A brown and brawny bunch Stubb
and Flask among them Ishmael glances behind him

BULKINGTON a handsome stalwart seaman with a quiet
reserve sits at another table with his young pretty
FIANCEE They talk in low voices holding hands

Ishmael turns backthe platter of steaks is almost
empty He takes the last cut a small overcooked
portion Studies it with resignation Hes about
to cut into it when his steak is removed by Sal

She grins and presents him with a whole new platter
piled high with fine rare slices Stubb and Flask
chuckle at Ishmael Sal gives them a stern look

SAL

Whatre YOU laughin at ye
chowder-headed bumpkins

(to Ishmael)
Eat young man No one heres
in a more privileged position
than any other Ye havent gone
to sea yet have ye Out there
a lowly sailors got to wait for
a second mate to help himself

(pokes at Stubb)
--like this boobie here Or
hes got to wait for this greasy
baboon of a third mate HERE

She give Flask a nudge knocking the cap off his head

SAL (contd)
But not in MY establishment
(back to Ishmael)
So eat laddie Eat

ISHMAEL
Yes indeed maam

He reaches enthusiastically for the platter Stubb and
Flask laughing heartily at him

Queequeg stabs up a steak with his harpoon and drops
it on Ishmaels plate with a big grin Ishmael smiles
back getting used to his new friend

EXT NANTUCKET STREET -DAY
A clear crisp winter day on the now crowded street

Ishmael and Queequeg emerge from the Spouter Inn Ishmael pushing
an old wheelbarrow piled up with his satchel and Queequegs sea
chest

Puffing on his tomahawk Queequeg reaches into his bag
and produces the shrunken head Ishmael reacts glancing around
self-consciously

ISHMAEL
Queequeg put that thing
away These good Nantucket
Christians will take you for
the devil himself

QUEEQUEG
(puzzledly)
Why do-ee say

ISHMAEL
For Gods sake its a mans
head A very dead real man
too Nantucketers dont carry
the dead around in their bags
They bury em dont ye know
that

QUEEQUEG
Aye Nantucketers buy-em too
I tell-ee For many coins

However Queequeg puts away the head He withdraws a
wooden statuette from his bag and gestures over it

QUEEQUEG
Me Yojo tell-ee what ship
Queequeg and-ee ship out on
He sabbee Yojo and-ee
sabbee

Ishmael looks down at the statuette then inquisitively
at Queequeg

ISHMAEL
Youre sayin yourYojo
wants ME to choose a ship
Is that what you mean

QUEEQUEG
Aye

ISHMAEL
Will ye be shippin out with
me then Is that what youre
trying to tell me Queequeg

Queequeg nods with a bright grin his sharpened teeth
white as snow He reaches into his bag again and brings
out a handful of coins Dropping them unceremoniously
to the ground he stops and crouches there

Ishmael stops and sets down the wheelbarrow watching
him curiously

Queequeg divides the coins into two separate piles
pockets half of them then stands and plops the other
half into Ishmaels hand

Ishmael doesnt understand but Queequeg has already
turned away to continue on down the street Ishmael
grabs the barrow and catches up to him

ISHMAEL
Queequeg Wait stopAVAST
there mate

Queequeg stops and waits puffing patiently on his pipe

ISHMAEL (contd)
Listen my friendthis is
simply out of the question
What the devil is the matter
with ye

A puzzled hurt look from Queequeg

QUEEQUEG
Ee dont want ship out wid
Queequeg

Ishmael tries to hand the coins back to Queequeg who
ignores the gesture waiting for an answer

ISHMAEL

NoI mean yes of course
I will What I mean is
YOURE better suited to pick
out a whaler best fitted to
carry us not I

(pushes coins back)
And I shall certainly not
take your money

Not looking at the coins Queequeg thoughtfully exhales
smoke trying to understand

ISHMAEL (contd)
Listen QueequegI fear I
must make a confession
(leans closer)
I used to be a school teacher
Dye know what that is

QUEEQUEG
Aye Missionary

ISHMAEL
Well not exactly What Im
tryin to say isI never

jumped a spar in my life

QUEEQUEG
Ishmael no sailor

ISHMAEL
(embarrassed)
Aye Me no sailor Its
just ye seeI have this

burnin desire to go to sea

Queequeg grins understanding perfectly He pats the
satchel with utter confidence

QUEEQUEG
Yojo sabbee Ishmael pick
ship

He takes over the wheelbarrow and pushes on Ishmael

catches up with him and the two stride together

toward the port Ishmael smiles feeling better now Queequeg
SINGS a lyrical Polynesian TUNE to himself

smiling aside at LOCAL CHILDREN who gawk up at him

as he passes by

EXT NANTUCKET DOCK -DAY

At the bustling dockside the Pequod is being fitted
for a long voyage

EXT PEQUOD (DOCKED) - DAY

A short bent SHIPS CARPENTER with a wrinkled face
oversees the loading of lumber His body is wracked
with arthritis but for his powerful arms and hands

An old grizzled SHIPS COOK watches as DOCKHANDS
carry food stores and water barrels on deck

By his side is PIP a black cabin boy of small

stature with a playful face Merry as a cricket and

bright as a cherub He toys with a tambourine as he

watches the bustle of activity A cheerful presence

clearly appreciated by the men at work

Overseeing the loading operation from an old wicker

chair by the gangplank is a heavy-set retired captain

PELEG dressed in the Quaker style He watches with sharp-eyed
care at every passing item writing them

down on a thick ledger

The SOUND of Queequegs powerful CHANTING VOICE wafts
over the dock SHIPS CREWMEN steal glances at the
curious duo down below as they approach

EXT NANTUCKET DOCK - DAY

Queequeg ceases his chanting scanning the contours of
the Pequods tall masts Ishmael looks up with him

studying the old vessel with admiration and curiosity

ISHMAEL

Its an old shippreparing
for a long voyage I gather

QUEEQUEG
Aye She be long-seasoned
ship

ISHMAEL

And covered with whale teeth

Their eyes lower to the deck where each bulwark is
decorated with the long sharp teeth of sperm whales
some used for fastening ropes Queequeg nods but
says nothing Ishmael ponders the whole ship
ISHMAEL (contd)

Theres something a bit

melancholy about her if

you ask me

As if to contradict him Pip PLAYS his tambourine and
hums in a light angelic voice Queequeg smiles at
him some vague brotherly connection between them

ISHMAEL (contd)
WellI suppose Yojos made
our choice for us

He musters courage and struts up the gangplank trying

to look swarthy Queequeg waits on the dock smoking
and leaning on his harpoon still assessing the Pequod

EXT PEQUOD (DOCKED) -DAY
Ishmael stops before Peleg who barely acknowledges him
ISHMAEL
Beg pardon sir Might this
be the Captain
Peleg stops writing and faces Ishmael with a closed expression
PELEG
Supposing it be What dye

want with him

ISHMAEL
I was thinking of shippin

Peleg frowns and looks him over critically

PELEG
Youre no Nantucketer What
dye know about whaling

ISHMAEL
Nothing sir but I want to
see what whaling is I want

to see the world

PELEG

(laughs at that)
Cant you see the world from
where ye stand young man You
want to see what whaling is do
ye Are ye man enough to pitch
a harpoon down a live whales
throat then jump after it Well
Ill tell ye this much theres
death in this business and it
can bundle a man quite quickly
into eternity Does that
frighten ye

ISHMAEL
No sir it does not

PELEG
I see Then have ye clapped
eyes yet on Captain Ahab

A ripple of discreet CHUCKLING from the crewmen nearby
Pip taps his tambourine forbodingly Ishmaels puzzled
but remains undaunted

ISHMAEL
Captain Ahab sir Who is
Captain Ahab

BILDAD another older gentleman appears from below deck
As thin as Peleg is round he glances over Ishmael with
a dry tight-lipped expression

BILDAD
Who is Ahab Who is THIS
Peleg

PELEG

He says hes our man Bildad
He wants to ship

BILDAD
Do ye now

ISHMAEL
I do Yessir

BILDAD
His lungs are sort of soft
(to Ishmael)
Captain Ahab is the captain
of this ship young fellow

ISHMAEL
But I thought I WAS speakin
to the Captain sir

PELEG

Youre speaking to Captain
Bildad Im Captain Peleg
We own this fine specimen
and its our job to see to
it that shes fitted out
with all her needs

(a doubtful look)
Including sir a crew with
goodly experience

Frustrated that hes failing this interview Ishmael
glances back toward Queequeg for support

EXT NANTUCKET DOCK - DAY

Queequeg sits on the wheelbarrow of their belongings obliviously
smoking his tomahawk pipe

EXT PEQUOD (DOCKED) - DAY

On his own Ishmael turns back to Peleg

ISHMAEL
Where IS this Captain Ahab

sir

PELEG
What do ye want with him

ISHMAEL
To see him Id like to
see him

The men at work now slow their pace eavesdropping
Pip rattles his tambourine at an ominous tempo until
the Cook gestures him to cease

PELEG

Thats highly unlikely He
wont always see me so I
rather doubt hell see you
A strange man he is indeed

(to Bildad)
A great ungodly god-like
man Id say

BILDAD
Aye but above the common

PELEG
(to Ishmael)
He doesnt speak muchbut
when he does youd do well
to listen

A huge shadow crosses over them Peleg and Bildad
fall silent as they look up

Queequeg towers over them standing behind Ishmael
with his harpoon He nods at Ishmael encouraging
him to introduce him Ishmael understands

ISHMAEL
This is my friend Queequeg
He wants to ship too

Both the captains look Queequeg over with some dismay
Everyone on board turns to regard this tattooed giant

PELEG
Quohog Doesnt look like
much of a Christian to me
ISHMAEL
Why hes killed more whales
than you can count

Queequeg rests a hand on his shoulder to stop him

He

coolly faces the captains and points at a small dark

knothole on the farthest mast

QUEEQUEG
Capn ee see him small dark
spot on mastwood there Ee
see him Well spose him
one whale eye Well den

He raises the harpoon and effortlessly darts it
An Olympic throw across the deck -- past Bildads
nose over the Cooks head -- a bulls eye into the

mast target The big iron quivers mightily

Queequeg playfully hauls at the harpoon line and
gives the two shocked captains a broad grin

QUEEQUEG (contd)
Dat whale dead

A silent beat Bildad turns excitedly to his partner

BILDAD
Quick Peleg quick get the
ships papers We must have
Quohog here I mean Hedgehog
whatever his name is

Peleg scrambles for a ledger opens it up He extends

a pen to Queequeg anxious for him to sign

PELEG
Look herewell give you
one-ninetieth percent thats
a higher cut of the ships
whale-oil cargo than weve
ever given any harpooner
So what say ye

QUEEQUEG
What be about me friend

PELEG

Oh all right thenwell
sign him on too
(to Ishmael)
But you earn only a fifth of
what HE gets

Ishmael and Queequeg exchange pleased grins

EXT NANTUCKET DOCK -DAY
Ishmael and Queequeg stride back down the dock their
belongings left behind Both in high spirits

VOICE
Hist Shipmates

Distracted by a craggy voice behind them the two slow
their pace and glance around

Elijah the demented old man from last night beckons
them from inside the open doorway of a blacksmith shed

ELIJAH (contd)
Shipmates Come hither

Ishmael and Queequeg stop and regard him curiously
He beckons them frantically They venture closer

INT BLACKSMITH SHED - DAY

A shadowy deserted place Blacksmith tools hang
like ancient weapons Half in the sunlight of the
doorway Ishmael and Queequeg face Elijah who
remains in shadow

ISHMAEL
What dye want old man

The ragged old codger looks them both over like a man possessed
In a harsh broken breath

ELIJAH
Have ye shipped in that
ship then have ye

Ishmael trades looks with Queequeg who regards Elijah
more with apprehension than curiosity

ISHMAEL

The Pequod Why yes weve
just signed the articles

ELIJAH

The articles eh

Anything in

Fire in his eyes as if this were a revelation

Queequeg shakes his head slowly

ISHMAEL

ELIJAH
All about it eh You sure

Ishmael starts to leave but Queequeg detains him

Ishmael frowns at the old lunatic
Queequeg stares frozen in place

ELIJAH (contd)

Queequeg cant take his eyes off Elijah a hint of

fear in his eyes

Ishmael tugs at Queequeg

and they

leave Elijah cackling at them from the shed doorway

ELIJAH
All but one All but one

EXT NANTUCKET DOCK - DAY

They exit the blacksmith shed and move on toward town
Ishmael looks a bit disturbed but tries not to show it
Queequeg is deeply perturbed Ishmael notices this
and jostles him

ISHMAEL
Dont take it to heart hes
just some crazy old loon

QUEEQUEG
Ishmael What be a soul

ISHMAEL
A soul Well thats a
difficult question

He hears a CHURCH BELL RINGING in the distance

ISHMAEL (contd)
Ye believe in God Queequeg
Yknowlike a big chief
over all men

QUEEQUEG
Like Yojo

ISHMAEL
I reckon so but bigger than
that Like a captain of the
stars

He notices TOWNSPEOPLE moving toward a white clapboard
church with a tall steeple Thinking to himself

ISHMAEL (contd)
I cant really explain it to
yebut I can SHOW ye

EXT NANTUCKET CHURCH -DAY
Ishmael and Queequeg approach the church Queequeg

stops before it hesitating Hes never been inside
one before and it unnerves him a little
ISHMAEL
Its just a house of God
QueequegOUR god that is
(urges him on)
Trust me Ye can learn all
about the soul here

Queequeg nods trusting him implicitly They move on

INT CHURCH -DAY

A CONGREGATION is gathered in pews facing a pulpit

unlike any other -- built to exactly replicate the
bow of a ship Its towering platform forms the mock

ships sharp prow

Ishmael and Queequeg enter quietly and take a rear
seat Queequeg drawing stares

Among the worshippers sits STARBUCK (30s) a sharp
good-looking experienced seaman with a pragmatic way
about him full of watchful curiosity Beside him
his seasoned WIFE and TWO beautiful CHILDREN Nearby
sit Bulkington and his Fiancee their hands clenched
tight Starbucks Wife glances toward Bulkingtons
bride the girl looks tense and anxious

Up front sits Ahabs weary Wife red-eyed from long
nights of tears And her son a fixed distant gaze

From the high pulpit looms FATHER MAPPLE a patronly
messiah-like figure

In the rear pews Ishmael recognizes the minister and
nudges Queequeg whispering aside

ISHMAEL
Thats Father Mapple I hear
he used to be a harpooner

Father Mapple scans the scattered gathering before him
with a furrowed brow and waves them all closer With
a deep penetrating voice

MAPPLE
Come closer shipmates You
there side away to larboard
And you gangway to starboard

Midship Midship

A rustle of feet as everyone quickly rises and takes
new seats closer to the pulpit Father Mapple waits
as they settle down He lifts his closed eyes as if
praying from the bottom of the sea Then looks down
every word like Gods commandment

MAPPLE (contd)
The Book of Jonah First
chapter last verse -- look
down and read it mates
And God had prepared a great
fish to swallow up Jonah

Below him the SOUND of pages turning MUTED MUMBLINGS

MAPPLE (contd)
The Lord called upon Jonah
to cry out against wickedness
but instead Jonah fled from
Gods command WHY Why did
he willfully disobey God
Because he thought it was
too HARD

The congregation stops turning pages everyone mesmerized
by the resonance of his voice

MAPPLE (contd)
TOO HARD Why everything God
commands us to do is hard
That is why He commands more
often than He tries to persuade
He knows that if we obey Him
we DISOBEY OURSELVES That is
hard It is hard because we
cannot flee from his command
as Jonah tried to dohard
because God is everywhere and
there is no hope of escaping
Him

(dramatic pause)

Now imagine poor Jonah
prowling among ships like a
burglar rushing to cross the
seas and escape from his God
But how could he do so By
thinking that a ship made by

men will carry him to places
where God does not reign

Ahabs Wife listens as if these words were directed
at her Tears stream down her face

MAPPLE (contd)
And now the time of tide has
come The ship casts off her
lines and sets away on the
great wide ocean But the
sea rebels Oh and the wind
Every sail tears every plank
thunders with trampling feet

(beat)

But Jonah does not see the
black sky nor the raging sea
all around him He does not
see it -- he does not CARE

Ishmael and Queequeg listen entranced So too does
Starbuck and his family

MAPPLE (contd)
The God-fugitive is plainly
known to all on board and
so they blame HIM for the
tempest upon them So they
lift up Jonah like an anchor
and drop him into the sea

MAPPLE (contd)

(booming stormily)
And God comes upon him in a
MIGHTY WHALE Clamps all his
ivory teeth about him Then
swallows him whole into the
belly of hell -- and dives
ten thousand fathoms down to
living GULFS OF DOOM

The men wince the wives cringe in vicarious horror
The children hide their faces in their parents arms

Having made his effect Father Mapple softens his voice
MAPPLE (contd)

To the watery world of woe
There among the ocean bottoms

bones did Jonah cry out his
repentance And God in that
whale breached and vomited

out Jonah upon the land And
ever after Jonah preached the
truth in the face of falsehood
against the proud commodores
of this earth and stood forth
his inexorable self

He turns to every face in the congregation appealing to
each one beseeching them

MAPPLE (contd)
Shipmates my brethren of the
seahear me Delight to him
who gives no quarter in the
truth But woe to him who would
NOT be true even though to be
false would be his salvation

Over this we feature the faces of Starbuck listening
with grave understandingAhabs wife eyes clenched
in griefand finally Ishmael and Queequeg The
Christian and the pagan trying to fathom the words

MAPPLE (contd)
Brothers let us pray

(his eyes closed)
Dear heavenly father may we
strive to be thine more than
to be this worlds or our own
For what is a man that he should
not live out the lifetime of
his God

A long silence over the congregation
FADE OUT
ACT 3
EXT NANTUCKET BAY - DAY
The distant Pequod sets sail out of the harbor beneath a

dramatic sky She passes the headlands bound for sea

EXT NANTUCKET HEADLANDS —- DAY

The tiny figures of women hasten to the top of the great
black cliffs

EXT CLIFF PROMONTORY - DAY

NANTUCKET WIVES in their bleak dresses and shawls run in
scattered groups to a high vantage point They collect together
on the promontory all eyes cast seaward to

catch a last glimpse of their husbands dwindling ship

Among them is Starbucks Wife a face of sad remorse
Stubbs two Doxies gushing tears Ahabs grieving Wife
who has no more tears left to cry All bear the look of
women who have become widows in their mens lifetimes

Standing alone Bulkingtons Fiancee gazes forlornly
out hugging herself with anxious dread Starbucks
Wife approaches and lays a comforting arm around her

From their view the Pequod shrinks into the horizon

EXT ATLANTIC OCEAN - DAY

The magnificent Pequod drives to windward her great
sails full to bursting She plunges through the big
swells of choppy Atlantic waters

EXT PEQUOD (AT SEA) -MIDDECKQUARTERDECK - DAY

A pitching deck alive with activity Sailors scurry
about climbing ladders reefing sails trimming yards
under the calm commands of First Mate Starbuck

STARBUCK
Back the main yard there
Up helm Hearts alive now

Struggling on a taut halyard from middeck Ishmael pulls
with difficulty Queequeg pulls with powerful ease

Third Mate Flask pulling rank to make up for his low
stature and ignorance shouts at those on the rope

FLASK
Pull ye monkeys or by gor
Ill give ye a good sea toss

He turns on Ishmael who stops his soft hands blistering

FLASK (contd)
Go to it landlubber pull
Flukes and flames boy are
ye that green in the gills

ISHMAEL
Not that green sir

He keeps pulling despite the pain Queequeg gives Flask
a surly look

FLASK
Whatre YOU lookin at ye
dumb painted savage

Second Mate Stubb leans over the quarterdeck bannister smoking
a proverbial short black pipe

STUBB
Lookin at a dumber one Id
say

He laughs and turns calling to a lookout high aloft

STUBB (contd)
Ho Masthead there Look
sharp Well be sightin for
whales from sunup to sundown
If ye see one split yer
lungs dye hear

EXT MASTS - DAY

High on the topgallant mast stands harpooner TASHTEGO
an American Indian with long hair and the noble face of
a warrior hunter A muscled giant like Queequeg
Climbing a swaying rope ladder in the breeze is another
harpooner DAGOO a coal-black barbarian with huge gold

loops in his ears Another giant

A strong gust of wind hits the sails The men react
immediately scrambling over spars like nimble spiders

STARBUCK (0S)

Hands by the halyards In
top-gallant sails Stand by
to reef topsails

STUBB (0S)
Jump my jollies

Dagoo and others tumble toward the topmasts among
them Bulkington The two men taunt each other good-
naturedly as they go about their dangerous business
shouting between masts

BULKINGTON
The squall Jump the squall
Lend me yer earring Dagoo
so I can secure this sail

DAGOO
Come and get it white skin

Both laugh as they climb right over the canvas of the
billowing sails

EXT MIDDECK - DAY

The halyard pulling stops Ishmael nurses his palms and staggers
across the heaving deck a bit seasick

A ships boom swings across the deck about to broadside
him -- Queequeg yanks him out of the way Both topple
across the deck together Stubb bellows a laugh

STUBB
One hand for the ship Mister
Ishmael one hand for yerself

Ishmael rises to his feet nods his thanks to Queequeg humiliated
but keeping his pride To Stubb

ISHMAEL
Aye aye sir But I dont
think its proper to make
jest of another mans peril

STUBB
Aye but youre wrong Its
laughter thats the final
consequence of everything
The only comfort a man has

and the wisest one

ISHMAEL
The easiest you mean

Stubb leaps down from the quarterdeck and claps him on
the shoulder with a hard but friendly whack

STUBB
The ONLY comfort shipmate
and the wisest I tell you
Wise Stubb thats what they

call me -- and thats because
whatever happens I go to it
laughing

Another bellowing laugh Ishmael nods accepting that
Flask joins them hard-eying Ishmael as he faces Stubb

FLASK

Just dont ever let fightin
FLASK catch ye laughin at
‘im Stubb

(nods at Ishmael)
So whatre we goin to do
with this pup

(to Ishmael)
Yer own mother would make a
better sailor

ISHMAEL

Flask picks up a bucket and tosses it roughly to him
FLASK

Then try this Swab the deck

since thats all yer good for
Ishmael resigns himself to it Pip dances by banging
cheerily on his tambourine lifting Ishmaels spirits
EXT QUARTERDECK - DAY
By the deckhouse Starbuck watches all that goes on

around him He glances toward the closed door of the Captains
cabin No Ahab in sight He calls out

STARBUCK
Mister Bulkington Give us
a good song to speed us on

Alighting down on deck Bulkington turns with reserved
manner Then BELTS OUT a song with unexpected relish

BULKINGTON
In the Indian Ocean Pacific
Ocean no matter what ocean
pull ahead yo heave O Soon
yell hear the cry Town O

The whole crew joins in as they work from deck to masts

CREWMEN
There she blows hard up
square the yards then steady
lads so cries the Captain
Soon as we get near boys in
with the gear boys swing the
crane clear boys pull ahead
now yo heave O

Swabbing the deck on his knees Ishmael winces from his
bruised hands but manages a smile and sings awkwardly
along Queequeg kneels down and joins him at washing
the deck Singing too

Nearby the arthritic Carpenter drills a short hole in
the planking Ishmael watches him noticing other holes
all around the deck in random places

ISHMAEL
Whatre those holes for sir

CARPENTER
Captains orders -- mind yer
own business

Taken back by that Ishmael keeps swabbing He gazes up toward
the Captains cabin door with ambivalent curiosity
Toiling beside him Queequeg follows Ishmaels eyes

QUEEQUEG
Ship wid no capn Yojo no

sabbee dis

Stubb passes by Ishmael rises to rest his hands

ISHMAEL
Mister Stubb sir Will he
ever make an appearance do
ye suppose Ahab I mean

STUBB
Your guess is as good as mine

ISHMAEL
Will we see a whale soon I
wonder

STUBB

We will and yell soon not
forget it Ye havent lived
young monkey ‘til youve
raised a whale

He moves on Ishmael stares out over the rolling sea

INT FORECASTLE -NIGHT

Cramped claustrophobic crews quarters Walls of bunks
around dining tables all too small for some thirty men
A rowdy sweaty atmosphere oil lamps swinging

Motley crewmen queue before a steaming turrine at a
Parsons table as the Cook ladles chowder into their bowls
Two of them PERTH and DOUGH-BOY examine their bowls of
watery stew with disgust

PERTH
Blast Chowder for breakfast
chowder for supper

DOUGH-BOY
This swill aint fit for a dog

COOK
Mind yer tongue swabby or
Ill cut it off and add it to
the pot

He brandishes a formidable kitchen knife Then fills a
bowl for the Carpenter who nods slyly at a big beetle skittering

across the turrine table

CARPENTER

Add that Cook -- mebbe itll
improve the flavor

The others laugh Sneering sourly at him the Cook
jabs down his knife to kill the insect He misses
The Carpenter whips out a hammer and swings down --
WHACK Bulls eye He grins at the pouting Cook

The men take their bowls to a dining table The
Carpenter plops down beside the BLACKSMITH a begrimed
old salt with burn scars all over his flesh Perth
and Dough-Boy sit next to them

PERTH
Say carpenter where dye
keep your rum these days Im
itchin for a taste

CARPENTER
What rum Its against ships
orders ye know that

Nearby Ishmael straddles a bench with Queequeg who
swaths Ishmaels raw bleeding hands with cloth strips

PERTH
Lookit them two lovebirds
(to Ishmael)
Careful with your hand mate
your slave there might be
mistakin it for supper

Queequeg turns with noble dignity
QUEEQUEG
Queequeg no slave Queequeg

son to island king

The other two laugh at that Perth bows mockingly

PERTH
Oh a thousands pardons your
Majesty

DOUGH-BOY

Hail to the prince of savages

Two brawny hulks sit opposite them red Tashtego and
black Dagoo giving them looks to kill Perth and

Dough-Boy turn to their stew suddenly quiet

Ishmael looks at Queequeg as he finishes bandaging

ISHMAEL
You pagans need to teach us
Christians the art of kindness

QUEEQUEG
No matter Queequeg-ee be
friends aye Queequeg hungry

ISHMAEL
Aye Grub ho

They rise and wend their way to the Cooks turrine

Stubb and Flask enter The mens rabble rousing settles
down to a respectful lull

STUBB
At ease ye sons of bachelors
We aint the Captn after all

TASHTEGO
What captn He dont exist

Stubb and Flask observes Ishmael with his swathed hands holding
his bowl with great difficulty as the Cook
ladles out stew

STUBB
Youre in a sad pickle lad

FLASK
What say we open some grog
to quell his growin pains

STUBB
Not without permission from
the Captn

FLASK

To hell with permission
He makes for the Carpenters bunk and kicks open a tool
box -- revealing a hidden rum bottle Flask snatches it
up The Carpenter jumps up alarmed

CARPENTER

See here Thats my medicine

FLASK
Potent medicine Ill wager

He pops out the cork with his teeth and starts to take
a swig -- Stubb grabs it away from him

STUBB
No medicine for you Flask
Lets christen our new pup
(to Ishmael)
Come here me boy This1ll
cure ye

Ishmael turns gingerly holding his bowl Stubb pours
rum over his bandaged hands Ishmael drops the bowl --
screams in pain Stubb pushes the bottle at him

STUBB (contd)
Quick Drink lad itll
kill the pain

Agonizing Ishmael grabs the bottle with hot hands

and takes a quick deep swig He spits out a mouthful
and gasps his insides burning worse than his hands

STUBB (contd)

Go on -- take another Ye
may be dry for a long spell
to come

Looking around at the mates GOADING him on Ishmael
takes the challenge He chugalugs from the bottle

FLASK
Aye Thats the manly way

Aloof on his bunk in bg Bulkington watches them

STUBB
Well done sailor

Ishmael cant speak his breath on fire sinking faintly
on a bench Queequeg pounds his back to revive him

The others eye the bottle anxious for a taste Their
grubby hands grope for it but Flask pushes them back
FLASK
Easy this aint for you
(to Ishmael)
Go to it pup Drink to yer
first whale kill

Woozy Ishmael downs another healthy swallow getting
used to the burn Getting drunk

The men laugh and urge him on their MERRIMENT rising
in pitch until

In bg comes a familiar THUNK-CLOP THUNK-CLOP

STUBB
Hist Cut your seizings

The crew falls silent eyes on the swaying ceiling
The RHYTHMIC THUNK-CLOP of a pacing peg leg on deck
Then it stops A long quiet beat between the men
Stubb turns to Ishmael in a low voice

STUBB (contd)
He lost that leg to a whale
is what I heard Devoured
it was Chewed up by the
most monstrous fish that
ever chipped a boat

FLASK
Ayea terrifyin creature
they say and fearful angry

STUBB
Well no whales ever happy
to be hunted I wouldnt want
any man in my boat who aint
afraid of ‘em

FLASK
An I dont want any who are
(to Ishmael)
Why Ive lowered for a sperm
whale from a leaking ship in
a gale off Cape Horn

Weaving drunkenly Ishmael listens fascinated
ISHMAEL

What about Captain Ahab

STUBB
Ahab Hes hunted more whales
than all of us put together

FLASK
Killed fifteen of em between
a sunrise and a sunset

ISHMAEL
What of the whale that took
his leg Did he kill it too

STUBB
Bulkington would know He
was there

All faces turn to Bulkington far removed in his bunk

FLASK
Tell us mate Tell us what
happened to the Captn

STUBB
Aye spin us a yarn

Everyone waits with anticipation Bulkington just
stares at the ceiling then replies with finality

BULKINGTON
I dont wish to speak of it

He says no more the others groaning disappointedly
Ishmael keeps drinking plowed under Stubb turns to
him feeding his imagination

STUBB
Ill tell ye this much pup
A good-sized sperm whale can
ram shiver and sink a ship
in a matter of seconds

FLASK
Aye -- even a Man o War

TASHTEGO
An dey thirst for human

blood

STUBB
Why sharks are so a-feared
of ‘em they dash themselves
into rocks just to flee a
whales wake

Drunken Ishmael listens with wide-eyed terror Pip
dances around the quarters breaking the tension

PIP
Crish crash Blang-whang
Ive heard all that chat now
Makes me jingle all over

THUNK-CLOP more pacing above deck Pip stops A
dead pause among the crew all eyes turned upward

The PEG LEG paces ceaselessly Back and forth
back and forth

ACT 4
EXT ATLANTIC OCEAN - MORNING

A bright cloudless day The Pequod sails along on
a calm sea

INT FORECASTLE - MORNING

In his bunk groggy-eyed Ishmael awakens A splitting
hangover He sits up painfully with his bandaged hands
and focuses on the bustle of men around him

Deckhands wash and dress preparing for the morning
watch Queequeg shaves before a shard of mirror with
the razor edge of his harpoon

A sailor has his head down on a bench the Carpenter
about to pierce his ear with a nail and hammer

Ishmael rises and shuffles to a wash bin holding his
aching head He winces to the RAP of a hammer -- and
a sailors SCREAM

EXT PEQUOD (AT SEA) -MIDDECK - MORNING

Starbuck and Stubb are on watch gauging the wind and
the luff of the sails Starbuck shouts up

STARBUCK
Helm there Luff a point

The SHIPS STEWARD rings a bell for the morning watch
Stubb booms down into the forecastle

STUBB
First watch All hands on
deck Come along ye solemn
rogues cease your preening

The rest of the crew spill onto the deck hastening
to their duties Stubb grins at a hung-over Ishmael
shouting close

STUBB (contd)
Youre on morning lookout

sailor Get aloft

Ishmael grimaces Nursing sore hands he looks up apprehensively
at the towering masthead

Queequeg steps between them

QUEEQUEG
Beg-ee pardon sir Queequeg
go aloft

STUBB

Nay every man takes his turn
He whacks Ishmaels aching back a quick laugh
STUBB (contd)
This mothers boy has got to
earn his salt Hop to it
ISHMAEL

Aye aye Sir

Steeling himself Ishmael takes the first rungs of the

rope ladder with swathed hands and painfully hoists
himself up He climbs up slowly unaccustomed to the
wide rungs

STUBB
Jump to it Legs man legs

EXT MAST - MORNING

Ishmael climbs faster with all his strength the ladder
swaying in the wind The higher he climbs the more
the ships seems to pitch and toss He looks down

A dizzying view of a tiny deck blue sea all around

EXT MIDDECK - MORNING

Queequeg waves to urge him on By now most of the
crew are watching Ishmaels virgin climb Starbuck
sidles over beside Stubb with amusement and concern

STARBUCK
You are a cruel taskmaster
Mister Stubb

STUBB
Aye but well make a seamen
of him yet

EXT TOPMAST - MORNING
High aloft Ishmael braves it to the topgallant mast
The lookout top under his feet are two thin sticks
a hundred feet above deck Like standing on weaving
stilts Ishmael perches himself holding on for
dear life Hes made it
EXT MIDDECK - MORNING
The crew CHEERS Grinning Stubb shouts up

STUBB

Keep your weather eye open
and look sharp

EXT TOPMAST - MORNING
Towering over vast ocean Ishmael forgets his pain and
scans the magnificent vista An exhilarating experience

EXT MIDDECK - MORNING
Men busy at work Flask tosses Pip his tambourine

FLASK
Give us some cheer Pip
Bang it rig it make fire
flies and rattle our teeth

Pip plays it and dances a fast jig skipping merrily
around the middeck toward the quarter deckthen
suddenly stops His eyes fix on an unsettling sight

Starbuck Stubb Flask all deckhands cease their
duties and fall silent Staring in Pips direction

EXT QUARTERDECK - MORNING

Captain Ahab looms high before the deckhouse A godlike
figure in bronze braced against the wind With his peg
leg and white scar on his face hes a frightening sight

Flanked behind him are the five Arabs we glimpsed at the
outset dressed in strange attire FEDALLAH the turbaned
one sports a sinister dark-eyed face with an ugly smile
of broken teeth Ahabs personal harpooner his shadow

Ahab glares down at the men scattered around the middeck
searching their faces
EXT MIDDECK - MORNING

Everyone faces him silent and still The three ships
mates draw close together their voices low

STUBB
Who are them funny-lookin
boys with the Captn

STARBUCK
Stowaways it looks like

44

FLANK
I dont like the look of ‘em
EXT QUARTERDECK - MORNING

Scanning faces Ahab finally spots Starbuck He hobbles
vigorously forward with a fixed glare

AHAB
Mister Starbuck

STARBUCK

AHAB
Send everybody aft Mister
Starbuck Everybody yhear

STARBUCK
Yessir All hands aft

Ahab THUNK-CLOPS along the bannister glancing aloft
AHAB
Mastheads up there Come
down

EXT MASTS - MORNING

The men on the yards descend quickly sliding down
sails and halyard ropes

High on his perch Ishmael climbs down urgently
no longer afraid anxious to get below

EXT AFT DECK - MORNING

Ahab climbs down and paces the deck with a familiar
PEG-LEG SOUND A restless dark-spirited figure

Starbuck comes before him followed by the crew

STARBUCK
All men assembled Captain

Ahab keeps pacing deep in thought

Looking on Stubb whispers aside to Flask

STUBB
Look at him Flask theres
something like a chick in
him peckin at his shell
fightin to get out

FLASK
Maybe hes got us all here
to show us how well he
walks on one leg

The last to arrive Ishmael cranes his neck behind the
others to get a better view of the Captain

Ahab stops pacing and plants a whalebone peg into one
of the Carpenters deck holes rooting himself He
faces the crew A deep throaty resonance loud and
forceful

AHAB
What do ye do when ye see a
WHALE men
The men look momentarily puzzled Then a tentative
chorus

CREWMEN
Sing outsing out for him

A beat then Ahabs glare dissolves away to a slow but infectious
smile He nods approvingly

AHAB
Good And what next

FLASK
Lower away and after him

AHAB
And what tune do ye pull to
in your whaleboats As ye
go after him

STUBB

A dead whale or a sunk boat

Ahab slams his fists down onto the bulwark -- BARKS
with guttural satisfaction He reaches into his vest

pocket withdraws his hand and holds something up in
the air for all to see a large Spanish gold coin

The men edge curiously closer Ahab brandishes it
high before them

AHAB
Look mendye see this
Tis an ounce of Spanish
gold A sixteen-dollar
piece

An enthusiastic murmur among the crew Pip rattles
his tambourine The murmur quickly dies down as Ahab
makes his way down to middeck The sharp THUNK-CLOP
of his peg leg rings out like a bell

EXT MIDDECK - MORNING

Ahab struts the full length of the ship moving from
peghole to peghole to anchor himself whenever he stops
the long deck his actors stage The volcanic fire
inside him burns the air all about him

AHAB (contd)
Look closer mates Dye
see it

All eyes shift back and forth between the gold piece
and Ahabs fiery eyes Starbuck glances toward
Fedallah immobile in bg Puzzled by it all

Ahab reaches the awestruck Carpenter with his toolbox

AHAB (contd)
Carpenter hand me yon hammer
And one strong iron nail

The Carpenter produces the hammer from his belt and
digs quickly into his box Ahab turns to scan the
gruff faces all around him

Men avoid his eyes looking only at the coin
The Carpenter offers the hammer and a nail Ahab

snatches them and half-strides back across the deck
to the main mast His voice begins with a low
intense growl building to a roar

AHAB (contd)
Whosoever of ye raises me a
white-headed whaleaye
white-headed with a wrinkled
brow and a crooked jaw
whosoever raises me that
snow-white whale with holes
punctured in his starboard
fluke I saywhosoever
among ye raises me that
ACCURSED WHITE WHALEHE
shall have this gold ounce

More murmurs from the crew louder and more excited
Stubb and Flask exchange hushed animated words
Starbuck watches in amazed silence

Detached from the crowd only Bulkington shows no
reaction He stares seaward with a grim face

The three big harpooners exchange challenging grins
Tashtego steps forward

TASHTEGO
Must be dat whale folks call
Moby Dick eh Captn

On Ahabs face a remarkable transformation He turns
toward Tashtego his low voice like an animal snarl
AHAB
Moby Dick Do ye know the
white whale then Tashtego

Dagoo speaks out before Tashtego can answer Ahabs
head shifting to him with reptilian speed

DAGOO
Aye That whale has an odd
spout toomighty large
andbushy with white wool
That the one Captn

QUEEQUEG
Queequeg sabee him Him got
many iron spears in him hide
Capn All twisketeelike

AHAB
Like twisted metal Aye like
corkscrews
His brow clears his voice a roar of barely contained
emotion

AHAB
Aye Queequeg the harpoons lie
all twisted in him like so many
corkscrews Aye Dagoohis
spout is a big one like a whole
shock of wheat as thick as a
pile of Nantucket wool Aye
Tashby death and devils
that white whale is MOBY DICK
Tis MOBY DICK ye have seen
MOBY DICK

The name seems to strangle him A spontaneous SHOUT
erupts from the men around him sharing his rage
Ishmael watches engrossed in the high drama of this
moment Finally Starbuck steps soberly forward

STARBUCK
I have heard of Moby Dick
Captain Was it not Moby
Dick that took off your leg

Ahab spins around to face Starbuck his face aflame

AHAB
Who told ye that

STARBUCK
Its common knowledge sir

AHAB

Aye Mister Starbuckaye
(to his crew)

Aye my hearties all round
‘twas Moby Dick that dismasted
me Moby Dick that reaped away
my limb like a mower a blade of
grass Moby Dick that brought
me to thisDEAD STUMP I stand
on now Aye ‘Twas that
damnedable beast that razed me
Made a poor pegging lubber of
meforever and a day
He lifts his hands clenched around both coin and hammer

AHAB (contd)

MOBY DICK And Ill chase

that white whale round Good

Hope round the Horn -- and

round PERDITIONS FLAMES

before I give him up
Starbuck reacts bewildered by Ahabs outburst He
watches disturbed as the men SHOUT Ayes of support
Ahab steps from man to man right up to each face

AHAB (contd)
This is what ye have shipped
for men To chase that white
whale on both sides of land
and over all the oceans --
til he spouts black blood
and rolls dead out

He turns to the main mast Slams the gold coin high on
the mast wood places a nail to it and hammers the coin
fast to the mast Then turns back calling the Steward

AHAB
Steward Go draw a great
measure of grog
(to his crew)
What say ye men Will ye
splice hands on it Now
I think ye do look brave

The harpooners are first to react

TASHTEGO
Aye aye

DAGOO
A sharp eye for the white
whale

QUEEQUEG

Sharp spear for Moby Dick

The rest now join in a CHORUS of Aye ayes Ahab
nods deeply moved by their reaction

AHAB
God bless ye men

The Steward rolls out a grog barrel to the CHEERING
crew Cups are filled to the brim Ahab turns to

notice the concern on Starbucks face

AHAB (contd)
What ails ye Mister Starbuck
Why the long face

Starbuck is hesitant to respond

AHAB (contd)
Will ye not chase the white
whale then Not game for
Moby Dick are ye

STARBUCK
Oh I am Im game for the

jaws of death if its part of

the business were here for

I came to hunt whales not my

commanders vengeance How
many barrels of oil will your
vengeance yield I ask ye

Ahab studies Starbuck with a colder narrower eye

AHAB
I see Is money to be the
measure of everything we do
then Then let me tell ye
my vengeance will fetch a
great premium -- HERE

He slams his fist against his own chest

beat between them Starbuck shaken by him

STARBUCK

What dye wish of me Captain

AHAB
Help me strike a fin Not an
impossible nor wondrous feat
for you -- the best lance out

all Nantucket Surely YOU of
all the crew would not be the
one to hang back Speak man

Starbuck wearily meets his fiery eyes sapped by his

energy He says nothing Ahabs brow darkens

AHAB (contd)
Your silence speaks loudly sir
(turns away)
The measure men The measure

He abandons Starbuck leading the party with animated
bravado passing around cups Starbuck shakes his head

STARBUCK
May God help us all

AHAB
Drink and pass Round with
it round Short draughts
long swallows my braves

(drinks deep)

Ahh tis hot as Satans hoof
Well done almost drained
Hand me another boy heres
a hollow So brimming life
is gulped and gone men
Steward Refill

He downs a cupful in one long draught Despite his
peg leg he suddenly leaps agilely onto one of the
whaling boats

The crew watches amazed by his charismatic energy intimidated
by him All but Starbuck

AHAB (contd)
Attend now mates flank me
Harpooners stand here with
your irons And ye mariners
all of you ring me inlet
me revive a noble custom of my
fishermen fathers before me

Stubb Starbuck and Flask grab their lances Queequeg Tashtego
and Dagoo appear carrying two harpoons each
Ahab waves them closer around the whaling boat

Ishmael bears silent witness something mystical in
the aspect of bald scarred Ahab towering above the
rest in the boat his black coat flapping about him

AHAB (contd)
Advance mates Cross your
lances full in front of me
Now let me touch the axis

Ahab leans down and grasps the three lances at their
crossed center peering intently into each mans eyes

Stubb and Flask cant sustain his inflamed glare and turn their
eyes away from his Starbuck gazes evenly at him

AHAB (contd)
Did ye three feel the full
force SHOCK of it Mine own
electric thing Now mates
be my appointed cup-bearers to
your three pagan kinsmen there

He abruptly pushes away their lances breaking the spell
Then he turns his laser-like focus on the harpooners
standing behind the mates

AHAB (contd)
Draw the poles harpooners

The three giant harpooners quickly remove the iron part

of their harpoons like proud knights before their king

They step up to Ahab with ritualistic fervor and -- with perfect
timing -- thrust the irons toward him

Ahab reaches down from the whaleboat -- slams his open

palm onto a sharp blade Blood gushes from his hand
Unflinchingly Ahab rises with bold majesty

AHAB (contd)
Now cant them Turn them
over I say Show me the
goblet end Turn up the
socket Soso Now hold
them while I fill Steward
bring me your flask

The Steward hands him a flask Ahab fills the harpoon
sockets with grog full to the brimdripping drops of
his own blood into each socket

AHAB (contd)
Now three to three ye stand
Commend these murderous chalices

touch them and ye shall become
parties to an indissoluble league
The three harpooners clink the sockets together

AHAB (contd)
Drink my brave harpooners
Drink and swear you that stand
the bow of whaleboats

The harpooners guzzle down the mixed rum and blood
to the last drop Ahab glances toward a shocked
Starbuck

AHAB (contd)
Behold Mister Starbuck The

deed is done

(to whole crew)
Drink all of ye And swear
DEATH to Moby Dick May God
hunt us all if we do not hunt
Moby Dick to his death

The crew caught up in the moment down their own
cups -- then BURST INTO SHOUTS cups raised to their
captain
CREWMEN

Death to Moby Dick Death

Every man of themthe harpooners Stubb Flask
Ishmael Perth Dough-Boy Carpenter Blacksmith

Only Starbuck refrains away from the crowd
On the whaleboat Ahab glances across the ship and
sees Starbucks aloofness His dark eyes focus

sharply on him Long unsettling looks between them
A moment of impending conflict

ACT 5
EXT ATLANTIC OCEAN - SUNSET

The Pequod drifts on a light wind her progress slow
INT CAPTAINS CABIN -SUNSET

Two polished harpoons reflect the last rays of the
sunset A spartan cabin twisted sheets on a bunk
Hunched over a table scattered with sea charts Ahab
pores over the four oceans His pencil traces over a
confused jumble of drawn linesthe courses of whales

STARBUCK Permission to enter Captain

Ahab grunts an affirmative too preoccupied to look up
Starbuck enters and waits respectfully a little tense

STARBUCK
You sent for me sir

AHAB
Mister Starbuck We are
inexorably bound together for
the duration of this voyage
You and I are intelligent
men shippin with savages
We need not be strangers

STARBUCK
I do not wish it Captain I
am tied to thee

AHAB
Good Good

He gestures him closer pointing over his charts

AHAB

See here Starbuck Tis the
migratory route of the sperm
whale No ship ever sailed her
course with one tithe of such
marvelous precision From the
Azores to St Helena around
the Cape to the Sea of Japan

Standing close Starbuck studies Ahab more than the map
STARBUCK

Time and tide flow wide sir
Moby Dick has the round watery

world to swim in

AHAB
Mister Starbuck I know his
latitudes his seasons the
driftings of his food

AHAB (contd)
I know his sightings from the
Seychelle ground to Volcano Bay
STARBUCK
Where lies Nantucket Ah here
(points on map)
where our wives and children
will carry the wee babes up the
hill to catch first glimpse of
these sails Your wife and son
will be among them sir

Ahabs face flinches A sensitive chord has been struck

STARBUCK (contd)

We must not disappoint them

I am no crusader after perils
Captain My course is set to
return safely home -- with a
full hold Tis the object of
our endeavor

Ahab looks up impatiently eying him with darkened brow

Hear me

AHAB
‘Til this be done

my boys face is to me as the
palm of this hand A lipless
unfeatured blank My vengeance
this very act was rehearsed by
you and me a billion years
before this ocean rolled

(draws him near)
All visable objects are but
pasteboard masks behind which
some unknown but still reasoning
thing puts forth the moldings of
its features If man will strike
strike THROUGH the mask How
else can a prisoner escape but
by thrusting through the wall
STARBUCK
The white whale is this mask
sir this wall

Ahab paces the room his peg leg scraping the floor

AHAB
Aye He tasks mehe heaps
mehe galls me I see in him

outrageous strength inscrutable
malice THAT is what I hate

STARBUCK
But vengeance on a dumb brute
sir That took your leg from
blindest instinct

AHAB
And Ill wreck my hate upon him

STARBUCK
Tis madness to be so enraged
To seek vengeance on a dumb
thing -- tis blasphemy

Ahab turns to confront him his words charged with fury

AHAB
BLASPHEMY Dont talk to me
of blasphemy man

He glares out the window at the sunset shaking a fist

AHAB

I would strike the SUN if it
insulted me What Ive dared
Ive willed and what Ive
willed I WILL DO

(turns to him)
You look pale You think me
mad dont ye Im not mad
I am madness maddened

Starbuck stares in utter shock He shakes his head

STARBUCK
Sir Im not much for fighting
a fish that too much persists
in fighting me Im here to

kill whales for my living not
to be killed by them for theirs
Butyou are the Captain

AHAB
Aye I AM the Captain

EXT ATLANTIC OCEAN - NIGHT

The Pequod drifts through a starry night A myriad
of moonlit sequins across the water

INT FORECASTLE -NIGHT

A besotted crew SINGS WHALING SONGS sprawled about
tables and bunks like slovenly pirates Their cups
empty most of them too drunk to move

Ishmael wends through them and turns down a corridor
INT CORRIDOR -NIGHT

Ishmael passes a doorway into the mates quarters and
glances inside

INT MATES QUARTERS - NIGHT

A quiet more civilized scene Starbuck reads alone
from a bible Stubb and Flask play a game of Draught

EXT MIDDECK - NIGHT

Ishmael emerges from below and breathes in the sea air
He looks toward Fedallah and his strange crew setting
up camp in a spare whaleboat Bedding and food have been
laid out as if they were on a different ship from the
rest of the crew They converse in low guttural ARABIC

Ishmael turns to the side for solitude gazing over the
moonlit sea Then realizes hes not alone

Ahab stands some yards away by the bulwark also gazing
out He produces a pipe and lights it cupping the bowl
with bony hands A ships lamp casts a flickering light
across his weathered visage

Ishmael retreats a step into shadow afraid of the man
yet fascinated by him

Unaware of him Ahab smokes in silence He takes the
pipe from his mouth and stares at it shaking his head
His voice unusually subdued

AHAB
Old pipehard it goes that
even YOUR pleasure is gone

He gazes up at the bright moon

AHAB
Time was when the moonlight

soothed me No more This
lovely light it lights me not
All loveliness is anguish to me
now since I can never enjoy
Damned -- most subtly and
malignantly Damned in the
midst of Paradise

He starts to turn away -- suddenly winces from a sharp pain
in his severed thigh He grips the pipe tighter as if
transferring his anger and pain to the object in his hand
AHAB

What business have I with

pleasure ANY pleasure
With sudden disgust he tosses the pipe overboard
Hidden in the shadows Ishmael stares down

EXT ATLANTIC OCEAN - NIGHT

The pipe tumbles down to sea its sparks scattering
extinguished in a sudden FIZZ as it hits the water

EXT MIDDECK - NIGHT

Without another word Ahab THUNK-CLOPS away Ishmael
gazes after him baffled by him

INT FORECASTLE -NIGHT
Most of the crew are dead asleep Ishmael steps quietly
among the cramped bunks No sound but for mens snores

the whish of water against the hull

Ishmael pauses to smile at Queequeg who sleeps with one

arm clutching his harpoon He makes his way to his bunk Stops
to discern another distant SOUND beyond the hull

An eerie haunting watery MELODY from deep in the ocean miles
away

Pip is awake on his bunk ears close to the hull as he
listens to the mysterious SOUND Ishmael crouches beside

him fondly watching the boy Their eyes meet

ISHMAEL
Is it mermaids lad

PIP
Whales sir Theyre singin

to each other

Pip smiles in the dim light Ishmael returns the smile
and retires into his own bunk listening too

WHALE SONGS seem to fill the forecastles cramped space

EXT CARIBBEAN SEA -DAY
A tropical sea under a beating sun Swells roll over translucent

turquoise waters Under full sail the
Pequod drives to windward

EXT PEQUOD (AT SEA) -TOPMAST - DAY

Suddenly -- an excited cry from Dagoo on the lookout
loud and insistent

DAGOO
There she blows There
There She BLOWS
EXT QUARTERDECK - DAY

Ahab yanks his peg leg out of its anchorage and hauls
up a ladder by his arms alone

AHAB
Where away

DAGOO (0S)
On the lee beam sir Half
a rifle shot off
Starbuck Stubb and Flask rush to the side to look out

STARBUCK
There go flukes

STUBB
By thunder A whole school
of ‘em

The deck becomes a frenzy of activity Queequeg and
Tashtego emerge from below harpoons ready

EXT TOPMAST - DAY

Dago swings between halyards like a trapeze artist
slides a hundred feet down -- and alights on the deck

EXT QUARTERDECK - DAY
Fedallah appears at Ahabs side waiting expectantly

AHAB
Steward Fetch me my glass

The Steward dashes over with an eyeglass Ahab snatches
it extends the scope and peers through it searching
AHAB
Time Quick steward

STEWARD
Thirteen hours sir

EXT CARIBBEAN SEA - DAY

Viewed through the eyeglass a dozen whale flukes beat
through the swells all grey No white ones

EXT QUARTERDECK - DAY

Ahab snaps the eyeglass closed disappointed He pulls
out a small book from his pocket and jots down the hour

Starbuck hurries up to him

STARBUCK
Ready to lower boats sir

Ahab glances aside disinterested in the whole business

AHAB
Aye Lower away

Starbuck rushes off Fedallah SPUTTERS ARABIC to Ahab
with a toothy grin itching to go out

AHAB (contd)
You too then

He turns away gripping a rail to help his crippled way
EXT SHIPS SIDE - DAY

Cranes are thrust out line tubs fixed in their places
and whaling boats swung over to be lowered sailors
working frantically

Three boats lower fast chains CLANKING ropes HISSING

and splash onto the water A clamor of SHOUTS rowers harpooners
and the three mates scrambling down ladders

into their respective boats

A fourth spare boat is lowered by Fedallahs crew aloof
from the others working silently and efficiently

In Starbucks boat Ishmael mans the oars with others brimming
with anticipation of his first whale hunt

Queequeg attaches rope lines to his harpoons The

boat casts away from the ship

Stubb cries out from his boat as they too cast off

STUBB
Well here goes for a cool
dive at death and destruction
And let the devil fetch the
hindmost

Casting off in his boat Flask gestures outward in
dismay

FLASK
Would ye lookit that

EXT CARIBBEAN SEA —- DAY

Fedallahs boat is already rowing out across the water
way ahead of them

EXT SHIPS SIDE - DAY

STUBB
(mockingly)
Theres a pretty fellow now
Lets give em jackals a run
for their money

All three boats row out at a furious pace
EXT CARIBBEAN SEA —- DAY

A school of sperm whales breach in the rolling sea
Spouts of misty air They move at a slow tranquil
pace unaware of hunters headed in their direction

From an airborne view four boats in pursuit of the
school Fedallahs remains far in the lead the other
three racing to catch up all close together

EXT STARBUCKS BOAT -DAY

Ishmael rows arduously working up a sweat He looks

over the rise of a long swell just in time to see great spouts
Queequeg the lead rower rows like a dynamo

guiding the pace Starbuck works the tiller

STARBUCK
There she blows again right
ahead boyslay back

He watches the school of whales then glances back at
the other two boats behind his

Flasks boat fast approaches Dagoo at the bow rowing
with as much power as Queequeg
EXT FLASKS BOAT -DAY

Flask shouts to Starbuck pointing toward the Arabs
boat

FLASK
Who are those devils sir
Did the Captn bring ‘em along
to make fools of us all
EXT STARBUCKS BOAT -DAY

STARBUCK
Never mind them Give way
pull out more to leeward

Stubbs boat Tashtego at the bow pulls ahead
EXT STUBBS BOAT -DAY
Stubb roars with laughter as his boat passes them

STUBB

(to Flask)
What difference who they are

to help us More the merrier
I say But lets give ema
bit of sport

(to oarsmen)
Snap your oars you rascals
Long and strong ragamuffins

His boat pulls ahead disappearing behind a tall swell

EXT STARBUCKS BOAT -DAY
Ishmael rowing exhaustedly near Starbuck turns to him

ISHMAEL
What do YOU think of those
new boys Mister Starbuck

STARBUCK
Smuggled on board to do Ahabs
personal bidding I warrant
(urging them on)

Spring men spring Theres
a fortune of oil out there
swimming right ahead of us
Thats what we came for and
thats our duty Duty and
profit hand in hand Pull

Their boat drops into a deep trough Just then one of

the sperm whales breaches directly in front of them

STARBUCK (contd)
Queequeg Quick

Queequeg tosses his oar and jumps up to the bow with
his harpoon Before he has a chance to do anything

EXT CARIBBEAN SEA - DAY

Fedallahs boat suddenly appears directly in front of Starbucks
boat -- surfing down the swell at terrific
speed to intercept the whale

EXT FEDALLAHS BOAT -DAY

Working silently like professional killers the oarsmen

a powerful lot Fedallah swiftly takes the harpooners position
at the bow The oarsmen stop rowing and in

perfect unison lift their oars in the air

EXT CARIBBEAN SEA —- DAY

Fedallah throws his harpoon with deadly force The
harpoon penetrates the whales flank the effect
instantaneous -- the water boils in a raging bloody
foam as the whale thrashes in agony

EXT FEDALLAHS BOAT - DAY

Fedallah launches a second harpoon into his stricken
prey with a loud primitive SHOUT OF TRIUMPH

EXT STARBUCKS BOAT -DAY
A second whale suddenly breaches next to Starbucks
boat too close -- its huge body striking the hull
The boat tips precariously
STARBUCK
There There Give it to

him

Queequeg manages to thrust out his harpoon from the
violently rocking boat The harpoon misses

EXT CARIBBEAN SEA - DAY

Instantly Flasks boat streaks in for the kill

EXT FLASKS BOAT - DAY

Tashtego quickly raises and slams his harpoon deep
into the body of the huge creature Blood gushes

EXT CARIBBEAN SEA —- DAY

The whales tail jerks upward catching Flasks boat --
flipping it skyward Flask and his crew are thrown
high into the churning sea far from view

Too close to Starbucks boat thrashing flukes slap
down against the water with crashing power -- and

send a wave that almost tips his boat over

EXT STARBUCKS BOAT - DAY

The force sends the crew spilling into the drink

EXT CARIBBEAN SEA -DAY

Starbucks men flail about in the turbulent water
trying to reach their boat

Ishmael splashes frantically in the watery chaos
whales all around him Waves from the slapping tail
plow over him frothing up water like an eggbeater
Losing strength Ishmael sinks beneath the surface

EXT UNDERWATER -DAY
Ishmael sinks fast amidst the enormous shapes of
whales behind him an underwater cloud of blood Eyes

wide open as he flails he glimpses an amazing sight

Across the deep blue a mother whale with her cub A
half-dozen bull whales circle protectively around her

Queequeg suddenly appears from behind -- grabs Ishmael
by the waist and quickly swims back to the surface

EXT CARIBBEAN SEA -DAY

Queequeg surfaces with Ishmael in tow Ishmael spits
out water coughing and gagging Fedallahs boat appears
as if by incarnation

EXT FEDALLAHS BOAT -DAY

Standing proudly in the bow Fedallah grins down
contemptuously down at Queequeg and Ishmael in the
water He reaches out and hauls them both into the
boat with superhuman strength Catching his breath
Ishmael looks out at the settling sea

EXT CARIBBEAN SEA - DAY

A dead blood-soaked sperm whale floats fluke out Fedallahs
kill A distance off Starbucks boat

men climbing back into her But not a sign of

Flasks boat

Stubbs boat drifts into view toward Fedallahs
boat

EXT STUBBS BOAT - DAY
Stubb looms in the stern his jaw set Missing all
the action hes not laughing now He glances at
the dead whalethen turns his envious eyes on the
grinning Arab Scanning the horizon of high swells
Stubb cups his hands and shouts
STUBB

Flask You impious old smut

Where the devil are ye
No reply Just the distant SOUND of CRYING WHALES
EXT CARIBBEAN - DAY
The three boats return to ship Fedallahs boat
towing the dead whale behind it The hunt is over
leaving behind a vast sea of blood

FADE OUT

ACT 6

EXT PEQUOD (AT SEA) -QUARTERDECK - DAY

Ahab stands alone at the taffrail staring out into the horizon
He barely acknowledges the activity below

EXT SHIPS SIDE - DAY

The giant dead sperm whale is fastened to the hull by
dozens of ropes hauled in by deckhands

Fedallah jumps on the whales back like an acrobatic
using it as a stepping stone to climb aboard

EXT MIDDECK - DAY

Fedallah leaps on deck as Pip dances and tambourines
around him The old Carpenter bangs a bell with his
hammer applauding him

Stubb and Tashtego climb aboard and shoot dagger

looks at the Arab a mix of admiration and resentment Fedallah
casually picks his teeth with a tapering

knife-long fingernail

They help aboard Ishmaelwet shivering in shock
Then come Starbuck and Queequeg both soaked to the
bone but composed as if nothing had happened

EXT QUARTERDECK - DAY

Starbuck reports to Ahab at the taffrail the Captain
gazing seaward as if oblivious

STARBUCK
Lost a boat sir Permission
to send out a search party

AHAB
Permission denied

Starbuck is stunned Ahab just stares out at the
rolling swells

STARBUCK
Beg pardon sir

Ahab slowly raises his arm and points a bony finger
far out to sea toward the top of a big swell
Starbuck strains to see out

EXT CARIBBEAN SEA -DAY

A floating speck far on the horizonan overturned
whaleboat On the upturned bow stands Dagoo Short
Flask sits on his shoulders waving his arms like a
semaphore The rest of the men cling to the boat
from the water

EXT QUARTERDECK - DAY

AHAB
There see Theres Mister
Flaskin the middle of a
blinded ocean

Starbuck peers at the strange sight and shakes his head
The rest of the crew look out and CHEER Stubb laughs
heartily Pip drums his tambourine dancing a jig

AHAB (contd)
Yed better get ‘em on board
Mister Starbuck before the
sharks discover ‘em

He hobbles away to his cabin Pip shakes his tambourine
at him humming a light tune Ahab glares at him Pip
stops playing and edges fearfully back Regarding the
boy thoughtfully as if noticing him for the first time
Ahab allows a hint of a smile Pip dances off

INT FORECASTLE -DAY
Men dry off and change clothes Queequeg rubs down
shivering Ishmael whos still traumatized his teeth

rattling

Dagoo and his crew climb below deck all dripping wet
but cheerful and laughing loudly

Ishmael turns to Queequeg
ISHMAEL
Why is everyone so damn merry

We almost drowned

QUEEQUEG
Habben all dime friend All

Queequeg laughs Its infectious and others joins in

INT MATES QUARTERS - DAY

Starbuck and Flask change clothes while Stub lights
his pipe and Pip collects their wet garments Flask
strips off a shirt and tosses it sourly

FLASK
That damned foreign monkey
takin our rightful whale like
that

STUBB
Aye What manner of creature
is he anyway

STARBUCK
A creature from our dreams

FLASK
How dye mean Like a ghost

STARBUCK
A devil perhaps

STUBB
Mans the devil all right
The reason ye cant see his
tail is because he tucks it
out of sight

PIP
An its coiled in his boots

Stubb laughs at that ruffling the boys hair

FLASK
Did ye hear the way he talks
to the Captn in that slithery
tongue What dye suppose
they talk about

STARBUCK
Striking up a bargain Id say

STUBB
Thats it Starbuck Ahabs
hard after that white whale
aint he Mebbe that devil is
tryin to get him to swap away
his silver watch or or

STARBUCK
Or his soul

EXT QUARTERDECK -NIGHT

Ahab stands on one of his sleepless watches his whalebone

leg firmly rooted in a peghole He gazes into the sea listening
to the exotic HUMMING of a BEDOUIN SONG from Fedallahs crew in
the spare boat

The only other SOUND comes from the whale carcass tied
alongside the shipthe SAVAGING OF SHARKS

Ahab turns to observe a commotion below

EXT MIDDECK - NIGHT

Stubb hastens across the deck accompanied by the Cook
Flask Ishmael and the Carpenter who carries a lamp
rigged to the wooden staff of a harpoon Queequeg
Dagoo and Tashtego follow them with spears and lances

STUBB
A steak a steak by heaven
before I sleep

They make their way toward the ships side to which
the carcass is lashed All the men look down at the
hump of the whales immense forehead

Fedallah silently drifts past them Startled by him
Stubb turns to the others with a look of scorn

STUBB
Ah now wait shipmates
wait Aint this the devil
that killed the whale

He bows mockingly to Fedallah who returns a skeletal
grin

STUBB (contd)
The harpooners choice of
steak eh Is that what ye
came for

Ignoring him Fedallah spits down at the carcass of the
whale with pure contempt Tauntingly he steps up to the
gold coin on the mast and taps it as if it were already
his Then returns to his crew in the spare boat

Stubb laughs and leans over the bulwark He takes the
harpoon-lamp from the Carpenter and shines it down on
the ferocious scene below sharks in a feeding frenzy
ripping at the dead whale

STUBB

Well that foreign devil may

care not for whale steaks

but Ill eat this fish in

one mouthful

(to harpooners )

Ready boys
Stubb throws the harpoon-lamp -- impaling it into the
whales forehead Queequeg Dagoo and Tashtego leap
over the side

EXT WHALE CARCASS - NIGHT

They land on the giant whales head Queequeg and
Dagoo carrying sharp cutting spears They climb down
toward the tail while Tashtego keeps guard against
the sharks with lances in both hands

EXT MIDDECK - NIGHT

Ishmael leans over the bulwark staring awestruck
at the infernal scene and the intrepid harpooners

STUBB
Just the tender bits boys

EXT WHALE CARCASS - NIGHT

Queequeg and Dagoo BARK SIGNALS to each other as
they struggle their way to the tail of the carcass
Despite their precarious position the slippery whale
and the unpredictable swells Queequeg and Dagoo cut
into the lower part of the whales tail Queequeg
slices out a large chunk of red meat when

An enormous shark lunges out of the water at him
It almost snatches the bloody meat -- but Queequeg
tosses it to Dagoo

Queequeg slips and starts to slide down the tail
section -- directly toward the massive jaws of the
shark He slams his cutting spear into the whale
and pulls himself up

Tashtego spears the shark A quick thrashing death
EXT QUARTERDECK - NIGHT

Ahab observes the antics of his men below with half
a smile Then returns to his watch gazing dead to
sea like a stone sentinel

EXT MIDDECK - NIGHT

The harpooners have returned the others all huddled
around something Stubb pushes his way in between
them as we move in to reveal five whale steaks
sizzling on a rudimentary grill

Behind the grill the Cook works fast sprinkling
whole spices on the meat chopping them directly
onto the barbecued steaks

STUBB
Be quick about it cook Im
famished

COOK

Awright awright dont be in
such a bleedin rush

He forks out a couple of steaks onto two wood plates
Stubb reaches for a plate

STUBB (contd)
This ones for the Captn

He takes it away hurrying up onto the quarterdeck

EXT QUARTERDECK - NIGHT
Stubb respectfully offers the plate of steaming meat

STUBB
Captn sir Would ye care
to have first honors sir

Ahab shakes his head gravely not veering from his
watch Stubb shrugs and climbs back down

EXT MIDDECK - NIGHT

Stubb sits down with Flask at a makeshift table
complete with napkins knives and forks In bg
Ishmael the Carpenter and the harpooners hungrily
watch the ceremony The two officers dig into their
steaks with relish Stubb leaning over in a low voice

STUBB (contd)
Poor Captn The whale eats
him stead of him eatin the
whale

Flask listens to the sharks savagings annoyed

FLASK
Blast those critterstheyre
kicking up such a shindy Im
losin me appetite

At the grill the Cook forks out the last three steaks
onto a platter The Carpenter steps over and gloats
at them with salivating eyes

CARPENTER
Cook lemme have one o those

COOK

Are ye daft Officers only

CARPENTER
But theres three steaks

COOK
Aye ones a second helpin fer
Stubb ones for me

CARPENTER

COOK

CARPENTER
Have a heart damn ye

The Cook irritably grabs a cutting spear from Queequeg

COOK
Ye want a steak Go get it
yerself

CARPENTER
Wot Down there

COOK
Gwon then

He shoves the spear into his hand The Carpenter stares
anxiously down over the bulwark Everyone watches him considering
it Hesitating he climbs over the rail with arthritic slowness
Then freezes on the bulwark looking

down fearfully at the loudly thrashing sharks

FLASK
Gwon whatre ye waitin for

The Carpenter looks back The Cook nods mockingly

COOK
An tell em to be quiet while
yer at it

Stubb Ishmael and the others all burst out laughing
Humiliated the Carpenter glares at the Cooks vulgar

grin Down below SPLASHING SOUNDS from two fighting

sharks -- the Carpenter jumps back off the rail in holy terror
An explosion of laughter all around

EXT MIDDECK -DAY

A complex whale-processing factory is under way the

carving of a dead whale and the melting of its blubber

The whales skin is peeled up from the floating carcass

by chains and pulleys from the lower masthead on a huge blubber
hook Like a peeled orange the skinned whale

rolls over and over in the water

The deck careens from the tremendous weight Sailors
crowd the windlass tugging and turning it singing

CREWMEN
Our captain stood upon the deck
A spy glass in his hand
A viewin of those gallant whales
That blew at every strand

Other deckhands slice tons of blubber into huge chunks
with mincing spades

They haul them to the try-works two giant pots on iron furnaces
Smoke billows and flames lick out as the Blacksmith feeds wood
into the open furnaces

The blubber chunks are pitched into the scalding pots
to be boiled down as the men sing on

CREWMEN (contd)
Your tubs in your boats boys
And by your braces stand
Well have one of those whales
Hand boys over hand

Large barrels are filled with gallons of whale oil
sealed and rolled down the gaping maw of a bow hatch
into the barrel hold deep in the bowels of the ship

CREWMEN (contd)
So be cheery my lads
May heart your hearts never fail
While the bold harpooner
Is striking the whale

The deck plankings stream with freshets of oil and
blood littered horrifically with bones and blubber
During all this labor Fedallah and his Arabs recline
lazily in the spare boat oblivious to everyone
Scowling at the lollygaggers Flask turns to Stubb

FLASK
Lookit ‘em devils Stubb
idlin away while the rest of
us slave I got a good mind
to stove their boat and send
‘em to Davy Jones
EXT MAIN MAST - DAY

High aloft in the rigging Ishmael paints the spars with
tar Queequeg does the same beside him both of them
hanging precariously over a fifty-foot drop His hands
healed and strong Ishmael no longer shows any fear

Below him a crows nest view a deck swathed in gore
Revolted by the sight Ishmael shakes his head woefully

ISHMAEL
Heaven help uswere the
vultures of the sea

QUEEQUEG
No sabbee what-ee mean

ISHMAEL
I mean theres no savagery of
beasts thats not infinitely
outdone by that of men

His eyes fall on Ahab emerging from his cabin
loaded down with charts his log book and a quadrant

EXT QUARTERDECK - DAY

Ahab sets the charts and book on a capstan raises
the quadrant to his eye Then he spreads the charts
out opens the log book reads from it checks the
charts and reads again All with a frantic edge

Giving up he paces like a caged beast PEG-LEGGING
from port to starboard ignoring the middeck hustle
and bustle Starbuck approaches him clearly
agitated
STARBUCK

Sir I must request that

ye put those foreign boys to

work Their slovenliness is

affectin the morale of the

crew

Ahab keeps pacing as if not hearing him scanning the
sea with murderous frustration Starbuck shifts over
to block his way adamant

STARBUCK (contd)
Did ye not hear me Captain

Ahab stops to glare at him his jaw tight

AHAB
Theyre not here to tend ship
or any other business Mister
Starbuck None but one single
purpose -- to hunt down and
slay Moby Dick

Starbuck starts to reply but an OUTCRY interrupts him

LOOKOUT (0S)
Sail ho Sail to larboard

Excited murmurs spread among the men as they race
toward the port side to view a distant vessel in bg
The Steward materializes with the eyeglass and hands
it to Ahab who grabs it and takes a quick look at
the ship

AHAB
English

He lowers the eyeglass deliberating to himself
AHAB (contd)
Prepare for visitors
EXT CARIBBEAN SEA - DAY

The two whaling ships of almost identical design heave
to and drift side by side

A small boat rows toward the Pequod The other ship
bears the name SAMUEL ENDERBY From her deck the
SOUNDS of ACCORDION MUSIC and FESTIVE REVELRY

EXT PEQUOD (AT SEA) -MIDDECK - DAY

The Pequod crew hugs the bulwarks to view the Enderbys
distant deck

EXT ENDERBY (AT SEA) - DAY

A wild celebration seems to be taking place on board
SAILORS are drinking and carousing dancing with
beautiful colorfully attired POLYNESIAN GIRLS

In sharp contrast to the somber Pequod its a ship
of laughter and joy

FADE OUT
ACT 7

EXT PEQUOD (AT SEA) - MIDDECK - DAY

Viewed from our deck the happy drunken Enderby crew
crowd the bulwarks facing us They wave flasks of
grog SHOUTING across and gesturing us to join them

Scanning across the faces of our crewmen we see the
eager anticipation of licking lips and ogling eyes
Ishmael gawks at the LAUGHING native girls their
voices like sweet music Queequeg nods knowingly

to himself a nostalgic look

Sunning in the whaleboat only Fedellahs crew shows
no interest

Flask turns to Stubb unable to take his eyes off
the girls

FLASK
Heaven seize me thats a
purty sight A man forgets
how awful lonesome it gets
out here

STUBB
Aye Those crack fellows
have done well for themselves

Starbuck smiles at the men Beside him Ahab sees and
hears nothing but the ENDERBY CAPTAIN climbing up the
ships side with his ESCORTS Starbuck turns to Ahab

STARBUCK
Permission to lower boats
sir The boys deserve a
short gam

AHAB
Permission denied

STARBUCK
(surprised)
But sir Its expected

Ignoring him Ahab faces the Enderby Captain climbing
aboard with a one-handed grip A stout-bellied man of
relaxed authority island garlands around his neck

AHAB
Welcome aboard the Pequod
sir Im Captain Ahab You
are a whaling ship I see

ENDERBY CAPTAIN
Aye Captain Thank you Im
Captain Dowling

He reaches out a right hand to shake his hand his
left hand behind his back Ahab nods with stubborn
gloom finding this man too jolly for his taste

ENDERBY CAPTAIN (contd)
Were a full ship sir and
homeward bound

AHAB
Im an empty ship and outward
bound

ENDERBY CAPTAIN
Then well bring ye good luck
My boys even won themselves a
few brides from the Fiji Isles
as you can see

Impatient with this ceremony Ahab gets to the point

AHAB
Hast thou seen a WHITE WHALE

The Enderby Captain grins at Ahab mischievously
ENDERBY CAPTAIN

THE white whale dyou mean
Moby Dick as some call him

Ahab twitches a shocked beat Before he can reply
the Enderby Captain swings out his other arm from
behind -- a white whale-bone arm with a hook

ENDERBY CAPTAIN (contd)
See you this

Ahab studies the arm with astonishment then lifts
his eyes to the Englishmans playful expression
who glances down at Ahabs peg leg

AHAB
Ha Youve an arm that cannot
hold and Ive a leg that cannot
run
(eyes narrowing)
The white whale

ENDERBY CAPTAIN
The white whale

All the crew turn to stare at his whalebone limb
AHAB
HE took that arm off did he

ENDERBY CAPTAIN
And that leg too

Understanding silence between them Unexpectedly
the Enderby Captain laughs uproariously

ENDERBY CAPTAIN
A great bouncing whale was
he Old as Genesis with a
milky white head

AHAB
(seething inside)
Harpoons sticking in all over
his hump

ENDERBY CAPTAIN
Aye And in a boiling rage

AHAB
Mine MY harpoons

He can barely contain his rage
AHAB (contd)
Tell me sir Tell me what
happened

ENDERBY CAPTAIN

(gestures at his arm)
Oh a shocking bad wound it
was Captn Ahab My surgeon
did his damndest but he had
to cut it off soon as it went
black Thank the stars I
brought me wife on the voyage
Shes been a great comfort
to me--

AHAB
What about the WHITE WHALE

His black look kills the Englishmans merriment who
regards him oddly

ENDERBY CAPTAIN
Well to the point after he
stove my boats we didnt see
him again for some time

AHAB
Did you cross his wake again
is what Im askin

ENDERBY CAPTAIN
Twice

AHAB
Are you saying that ye could
notfasten

ENDERBY CAPTAIN
Why would I WANT to Isnt
one limb enough That white
monster doesnt bite -- he
SWALLOWS

Reacting Ishmael and the other men look on with horror

ENDERBY CAPTAIN (contd)
I have a wife on board and
a profitable homecoming
Why should I take the risk
A beat Ahab pacing agitatedly as the man chatters on

Ahabs eyes

The Enderby

ENDERBY CAPTAIN (contd)
No thank you no more white
whales for me Hes best
left alone dont you think

enlarge turning to him with great contempt

AHAB

He is but hell be hunted for
all that sir Whats best
left alone is not always what
least invites Like a cursed
magnet is that whale to me
dye understand How long
since you saw him last

Captain squints at Ahab then laughs
ENDERBY CAPTAIN

Bless my soul sir Your bloods
at the boiling point

His laughter is short-lived Ahab suddenly spins around

to Starbuck

Ahab stomps
the Enderby

AHAB

Mister Starbuck prepare to
make way Weve wasted enough
time

(to Enderby Captain)
Good day Captain
toward the helm After a bewildering pause
Captain looks at Starbuck

ENDERBY CAPTAIN
Whats the matter with him
Has he lost his senses

STARBUCK
No offense Im sure sir
its no doubt the pain in his
bleeding stump

ENDERBY CAPTAIN
Hmphh The mans mad

He turns indignantly away to deboard signaling his men

ENDERBY CAPTAIN (contd)
Away boys I11 not spend
another moment on this ship

Starbuck stares after the Englishman not moving All
around him the crew is frozen in stunned amazement

AHAB
Mister Starbuck did ye not
hear me Prepare to sail

Starbuck stares angrily back at him rooted to the spot Ishmael
and the rest gaze anxiously away at the NOISY

celebration aboard the Enderby deprived of their

much-needed furlough

The Enderby Captain climbs to his boat shouting up

ENDERBY CAPTAIN
Do not be a fool Captn Do
not pursue Moby Dick I warn
ye Beware sir hes a demon
(thunderously)
Beware the BLASPHEMERS END

AHAB
Curses throttle ye
(shouts down)
Starbuck Set sail I say
Obey me damn ye NOW
Starbuck turns to the crew a walking powderkeg

STARBUCK
Man the sheets Jump to it

The deck becomes a flurry Sailors scramble about
and climb the masts to unfurl sails Many of them

glance toward the Enderby with open discontent

As everyone works a tense undertone of mutiny

EXT CARIBBEAN SEA -DAY

From afar the two ships part in opposite directions

The Pequod drives hard to southerly winds A ship
alone on the blue-green expanse

EXT PEQUOD (AT SEA) - MIDDECK -DAY

Ishmael tightens a halyard at the main mast Stubb
fixes a brace beside him Ishmael glances at the
glistening gold coin hammered to the mast then looks
away toward the Captain

Ahab is at his usual watch facing dead to windward
brooding with stormy thoughts

ISHMAEL
I fear the old mans a little
out of his wits
Flask passes by darting a disgruntled glance at Ahab

FLASK
Blast his eyeshe has no
heart

STUBB

Agh Ive seen worse Better
to sail with a moody good
captain than a merry bad one

Pip sits on a capstan with his untouched tambourine
watching the ill mood around him

Perth and Dough-Boy swab the deck SQUABBLING AD-LIB
with each other in low angry voices

EXT QUARTERDECK - DAY
Starbuck draws near Ahab determined to speak his mind

STARBUCK
Captain Ahab sir--

AHAB
Not now Leave me be

Exasperated Starbuck glares at him and turns away
He looks down to witness a scene below

EXT MIDDECK - DAY
Perth dumps a swab bucket and splashes Dough-Boy
A fight quickly breaks out Perth pulls a knife --
until Stubb grabs his wrist and yanks it away

EXT QUARTERDECK - DAY

Drawn to the commotion Ahab leans over the bridge
rail with Starbuck

AHAB
Trouble there Second Mate

STUBB
Nothin of concern sir

Ahab turns away Starbuck talks to his back persistent

STARBUCK
The men are out of sorts
We may not see another ship
for months Captain and it
does not bode well that we
deprive em of even a little
recreation

AHAB
They are whalers Mister
Starbuck This is not a
society ball
The Steward rings the watch bell breaking the tension
EXT MIDDECK - DAY
Stubb pushes the knife back to Perth low-voiced

STUBB
Get below Perth

PERTH
He started it--

STUBB
Quiet Go swab the focsle
til ye learn your manners

Perth struts sullenly away

EXT QUARTERDECK - DAY

Starbuck stares intently at the Captains back Ahab
turns and gives him a dismissing look

AHAB
To your duties Starbuck

STARBUCK
Aye ayeSIR
INT FORECASTLE — DAY

Fetching a bucket Perth extracts a hidden flask from
under his bunk He sneaks a long deep swig

Starbuck barrels downstairs in a foul state of mind

STARBUCK
Perth

Perth quickly reconceals his cache and grabs the bucket

STARBUCK (contd)
Get aloft to the lookout
PERTH
But it aint my watch sir

STARBUCK
I want ye where I can see ye

Perth drops the bucket and ambles disgruntledly toward
the stairs a little drunk

STARBUCK (contd)
Get along ye shabby rascal

or Ill give ye a whale-bonin

PERTH
Ye neednt speak so harshly--

Starbuck shoves him up the steps
STARBUCK

On your way

EXT MASTHEAD - DAY

High aloft Perth climbs the main mast to the lookout
GRUMBLING to himself all the way

He looks down to see Starbuck crossing the deck and
scowls down at him

PERTH
Damned St Jago monkey

Inches above him a loose hoisting block dangles and
swings precariously in the breeze

Sneering downward Perth spits toward the deck

PERTH (contd)
May God sink the lot of ye

A squall picks up Perth turns back up -- the block
hits him square in the face Dazed he lets go the
ropes

EXT MIDDECK - DAY

Crossing the deck Starbuck stops to hear

A sudden SCREAM from above Everyone looks up at

Perths plummeting figure He CRASHES DOWN on the
deck with full impact -- right in front of Starbuck

Deckhands rush to Perth lying in a twisted sprawl
His neck broken

Starbuck looks on in horror

EXT CARIBBEAN SEA - SUNSET

A blood-red sunset and spectacular billowing clouds
frame the Pequodher sails furled

EXT PEQUOD (AT SEA) - MIDDECK - SUNSET

A sail-swathed corpse rests on a bulwark board A
somber crew gathers around the ships side their set
faces aglow in the sunset The Captain and the three
mates stand by the bulwark around the body

Ahab opens a bible to begin reading Strangely he
cant bring himself to speak the printed words before
him He gruffly hands the bible over to Starbuck
Frowning at him Starbuck reads the last rites

STARBUCK
They go down to the sea in
ships that do business in
great waters These see the
works of the Lord and his
wonders in the deep

EXT TOPMAST - SUNSET

Perched high aloft Ishmael witnesses the sea burial
below sun and wind burning his face

EXT MIDDECK - SUNSET

In the spare whaleboat Fedallah and his Arabs pass
around a hooker pipe oblivious to the Christian
ceremony Fedallah exhales smoke with languid
disregard

Starbuck finishes the rites in his own words

STARBUCK
Lord of all the seas we here
commend this mariners spirit
into thy hands

He nods to Stubb and Flask and they tip the bulwark
boardPerths body drops into the sea with a small
SPLASH And disappears into its watery grave

A long beat as the men gaze down

AHAB
So be it then Were born
in throes ‘tis only fit that
we should live in pains and
die in pangsonly to end in
an unmarked grave

Starbuck a tinderbox of bitter emotions mutters to
him in a low voice
STARBUCK
To what end might that be
sir To a blasphemers end
as the English captain said

Ahab glares at him with a blackened brow Starbuck
shuts the bible and gazes back trying nobly to
contain himself

STARBUCK (contd)
Life holds US sir We do
not hold IT

Ahab faces him raising his voice for all to hear

AHAB
Do ye dare to question me

STARBUCK
I dont dare sir I only
think I blame myself for
this good sailors death

AHAB
A careless sailor

STARBUCK
Perhaps But the men see it
as an ill prophecy

AHAB
Prophecy

He wheels about to face the crew All around the men

edge fearfully back

AHAB (contd)
PROPHECY

He scans their facesignorant superstitious faces

AHAB (contd)
Ill give ye a prophecy my
shipmates Death to Moby Dick
Aye I1l be both a prophet
and fulfiller then

He THUNK-CLOPS between them moving from face to face

with a quickening pace and rising voice to galvanize
them Starbuck watches him gravely

AHAB (contd)

And the fulfillment of this
prophecy is what ye have all
agreed to share with me

(a raised fist)
Death to my dismemberer --
to Moby Dick Thats more
than even the greatest GODS
could do I tell ye

His effect on them is hypnotic his passion burning
with redoubled fury as he shouts

AHAB (contd)
The godsve knocked me down
theyve mocked this captive
king -- but I am up again
Now it is THEY who take to
their heels and run Hiding
from ME

Wild-eyed Ahab turns to glower defiantly at the
cloudy red sunset

AHAB (contd)

Come Come out behind your
cotton clouds Come and
strike ME I have no long
guns to reach ye -- only
THESE

(raises his hands)
My bony fingers Come then
See if ye can swerve me

Ahab laughs defiantly and faces Starbuck with fire in
his eyes shaking a fist at him

AHAB (contd)
Swerve ME Ye cannot swerve
me Else ye swerve yourself

EXT TOPMAST - SUNSET

On his lookout Ishmael watches the drama below Then
unexpectedly something distracts him out to sea

EXT CARIBBEAN SEA - SUNSET

An immense white whale plunges through distant waters
a tall jet of misty air blowing out of his spout

EXT TOPMAST - SUNSET

Ishmael gapes seaward He cant believe his eyes
He tries to shout out but can only gasp his words a
stammered hush Hes speechless

EXT MIDDECK - SUNSET

Pacing around Starbuck Ahab raises his fist to the
heavens

AHAB (contd)

Swerve me Never The
path to my purpose is laid
with iron rails -- on which
my very soul is grooved
to run

(to Starbuck)
And NAUGHT will stop me
Mister Starbuck

Suddenly Ishmaels VOICE BOOMS OUT at the top of his
lungs

ISHMAEL (0OS)
Thar she blows She blows
to starboard
(loud and clear)
The WHITE WHALE

A stunned beat Ahab charges past Starbuck -- bounds
onto the quarterdeck

The men bolt to the starboard bulwark hugging the
sides peering seaward

EXT CARIBBEAN SEA -SUNSET

Nothing there Only a flat expanse under the sinking
sun
EXT QUARTERDECK - SUNSET

Ahab stares furiously outward willing him to appear

EXT CARIBBEAN SEA - SUNSET

Still nothing Then suddenly he breaches

MOBY DICK The mighty feared leviathan himself
Mangled iron harpoons protrude out from a pale skin
mottled with scars and barnacles

EXT QUARTERDECK -SUNSET

Ahabs face starts to convulse

EXT MIDDECK - SUNSET

The ships crew are speechless all eyes fixed on
the awesome sight of the white whale

EXT CARIBBEAN SEA -SUNSET
MOBY DICK dips down his great white head and begins
slowly to dive for the deep The last visible sign

of him is his tail

ISHMAEL (0OS)
There go flukes

The enormous split jib tail rises up higher and
higher -- then slaps the water defiantly Then
disappears

EXT QUARTERDECK -SUNSET

Ahabs hands grip the bulwark his knuckles white
The scar down the side of his head looks swollen
and reddened by the skys orange glow His face
tightens like a coil until he finally EXPLODES
A BELLOWING HOWL OF UNGODLY RAGE

FADE OUT
END PART ONE
