Shadow of the Vampire

by Steven Katz

Revised March 22 1999
Note

Shadow of the Vampire is a fictionalized account of the
filming of the first vampire movie FW Murnaus 1922
Nosferatu There are three different types of film specified
in the script which should be noted beforehand

1 The movie Shadow of the Vampire itself as it follows the
cast and crew of Nosferatu through various locations in 1921
Germany Czechoslovakia and Poland This movie is in color
and uses contemporary effects and technologies

2 Actual footage from Murnaus Nosferatu Scenes from
Nosferatu are presented in their original state shot through
an iris black and white silent etc

3 Recreated footage from Nosferatu Because the actors in
Shadow of the Vampire are not those in Nosferatu it is
necessary to recreate certain scenes from the earlier film
featuring contemporary actors This footage should be
doctored to match the older movie
TITLE SEQUENCE

Black In the darkness we hear a sad spooky voice intoning
what sounds like an Eastern European dirge Then a series of
shadowy images appear an archway a figure the iris of an
eye in which theyre reflected

The POV shifts and a different series of images appear-—-the
interior of a film studio the inside of a motion picture
camera--intercut with

EXT MEDIEVAL CITY -- DAY

Presumably Bremen A church steeple in the foreground the
town square behind it

(Actual footage from Nosferatu )

INT HUTTERS HOUSE -- DAY

GUSTAV VON WANGENHEIM portraying the character of Hutter
stands in front of a mirror tying his neckpiece He wears
early 19th-century German traveling clothes

(Recreated from Nosferatu )

EXT HUTTERS HOUSE -- DAY

CLOSE ON GRETA SCHROEDER portraying the character of Ellen
(Hutters wife) leaning over a windowbox dangling a piece of
string above a cat She wears a 19th century hoop dress and
her hair is in long finger-curls

(Recreated from Nosferatu)

MURNAU (0S)
Nice pussy Nice pussy Youre very
content right now arent you Ellen
You live in a nice house You wear
pretty clothing And best of all
youre married to a wonderful man
whos promised to love you forever
You little suspect that hes about to
go on a long journey And that when
he returns hell bring with him the
death of love And your womb will be

(MORE)
MURNAU (0S) (contd)
barren and your bed will be cold and
in all the world you will be alone

END TITLE SEQUENCE

INT JOFA STUDIOS -- HUTTERS HOUSE SET -- DAY

Same shot The camera pulls back to reveal that the exterior
of Hutters house is in fact a film set--a little oasis of
light--erected in a cavernous barrel-vaulted studio

And standing in front of it are three men well come to know
as MURNAU GRAU and MULLER Theyre wearing lab coats and
safety goggles and look more scientists than filmmakers

Everyone waits breathlessly for the directors approval

MURNAU
And--end Print it

-eand then flies into action with military precision
striking the set switching off the phonograph (providing
background music) carrying a chair to the director

Who rips off his goggles providing us with our first real look
at FRIEDRICH WILHELM MURNAU 33 tall handsome with red hair
and a distant preoccupied air hes capable of bringing to
intense focus whenever hes concentrating

Which he demonstrates right now by focusing on

MURNAU (CONT )
Wolf have we established pathos

-WOLFGANG MULLER the photographer 30s glasses a little
retiring He looks up from where hes dismantling the camera
clearly enrapt by MURNAUs attention

MULLER
Perfectly Herr Doctor In one take

MURNAU
Good Get the film to the lab right
away I want to see rushes first
thing in the morning before we leave
Albin

ALBIN GRAU producer and art director walks over late
thirties something of an Aesthete

GRAU
Yes Herr Doctor
MURNAU
Hurry up and strike your set will
you This Potemkin village is costing
our investors a fortune

GRAU
Shooting outside the studio will cost
them even more

MURNAU
Such is the price of genius
(shouting)
God save me from all this phony shit

He throws out his arms accidentally sends a stack of film
tins flying from the hands of MULLERs assistant (PAUL)

Everyone freezes Theres a long beat until oblivious
MURNAU sits turns to his script The crew resumes its work
PAUL falls to his knees scrambles to pick up the tins

PAUL
Im sorry Herr Doctor

GRAU
Was there something wrong with the
set Friedrich

MURNAU
No Im anxious to get out of here
thats all But I do need your
inventory for the trip Alsoa
complete itinerary and a scene break-
down by costume and set Speaking of
which I looked over your renderings
last night for the last scene in
Ellens bedroom I think theyll be
fine

GRAU
High praise Herr Doctor

MURNAU
Well need blueprints of course and
photos for when we finally get round
to building it on Helgoland And
there was something elseoh yes the
cat was sluggish

GALEEN (0S)
Jesus Albin Whats wrong with you
Take the damned thing out and have it
shot
We look over to see HENRIK GALEEN the screenwriter 30s
scholarly Hes sitting on packing crate a sheaf of manu-
scripts spread across his lap

MURNAU
Henrik I hope were not going to be
out in the field without enough copies
of your script

GALEEN
No Friedrich The brothers of the
Monastery are putting the gold leaf on
them now

MURNAU
(ignoring him shouting)
Hurry up ladies and gentlemen We
have a train to catch

He turns back to his script a steel door is opened the light
and noise of 1921 Berlin pour in

Enter GRETA wearing a dressing gown and smoking a cigarette in
an ivory holder Without her wig and make-up she seems
dangerously young and beautiful perhaps seventeen

MURNAU
Nicely done Greta For a moment I
even thought I saw a premonition of
evil cross your face

GRETA
(sitting beside him)
It wouldnt surprise me With all the
spooky shit youve been saying to me
On-camera and off

MURNAU
I told you its important for the
realistic effect

GRETA
Yes I know all about it Thats why
were being forced to pack up and
gowhat do you call this business
again

MURNAU
On-location

GRETA
On-location To Transylvania
MURNAU
Actually were not going to
Transylvania Were going to
Slovakia

GALEEN
Herr Doctor I believe one is supposed
to call it Czechoslovakia now

MURNAU
Yes yes Czechoslovakia

GRETA
But why do we have to leave Berlin
just now At the start of the theater
season

MURNAU
(ignoring her)
Albin has your man arranged the cars

GRAU
Yes Two

GRETA
Do you have any idea the parts Ive
been offered at long last The
salaries

MURNAU
Will that be enough

GRAU
Itll have to be Its probably every
car in the region

MURNAU
Good
GRETA
Herr Doctor youre ignoring me
(seductively)

There was a time when you didnt
ignore me

MURNAU
Honestly Greta why would anyone care
to act in a play when they had the
opportunity to act in a film

As GRETA continues

a sordid-looking man in an ambulance

drivers coat (a red cross on his sleeve) comes up and
whispers something to MURNAU
GRETA

You certainly didnt think that when
you were directing plays for
Reinhardt In any case I dont like
acting for the camera A theatrical
audience gives you life while this
thing

(indicating the camera)
-emerely takes it from you

MURNAU turns sharply takes her hand Like MULLER before her
she responds rapturously

MURNAU

(softly confidently)
Listen to me Greta I conceived this
role especially for you Ellen isa
woman who discovers the ultimate
expression of love in the most
exquisite pain imaginable Sound
familiar It will be your most
demanding role The role that will
make you great as an actress
Consider it a sacrifice to your art

He stands follows the sordid-looking man outside She
watches him turns--a little embarrassed--to the others

GRETA
(recovering)
Im already being paid peanuts
»exits GALEEN watches her go turns to GRAU

GALEEN
So whatd you give the cat

GRAU
Chloral

MULLER
Chloral

GRAU

Its hard to keep the damn things
docile under the lights Did it show

GALEEN
It looked pickled

GRAU
Not so much as Greta
MURNAU returns Looks at his pocketwatch

MURNAU
Almost dark Well everything here
seems to be in hand

GRAU
Friedrich we still need to talk about
the vampire

MURNAU
No noits nearly dark Im
already late Wrap things up for me
here will you Albin I1l see you
all in the morning

MURNAU jogs to the door

GRAU
(shouting after him)
But what costume should I pack for
him What make-up

MURNAU
It doesnt matter And be sure that
imbecile Gustav doesnt miss the

train
-exits

GRAU

Wheres he running off to
GALEEN

Perhaps he has a woman
MULLER

(meaningfully)

Or aman
They smile knowingly at this Then jokingly
GALEEN
Did you notice how concerned he was

whether or not it was after dark

GRAU
Perhaps our director is the vampire
EXT JOFA STUDIOS -- SUNSET

MURNAU climbs into his car the chauffeur shuts the door gets
behind the wheel drives away We follow it through downtown

illicit scene is plunged into darkness again

throat She moans in pleasure turns her face away sucks the
smoke out of a cigarette holder

MICHELINE
Herr Doctor I have a pain

He lifts one of her legs slowly peels back the dress and
kisses the place where her rolled stocking reveals her thigh

MURNAU
Does that feel better

MICHELINE
Are you really a doctor

MURNAU
Yes Of philosophy

She smiles lewdly at him then suddenly scissors him between
her legs flips him over onto the settee climbs on top

Slaps him playfully And then does it harder MURNAU smiles
surrenders to her now hes the one whos rapturous

We look down toward the stage performing a torch song for

evening gown With bats wings

INT MURNAUS APARTMENT -- STUDY -- NIGHT

MICHELINE grabs him by the throat

MICHELINE

characterization coming from a man
Ive spent the past two hours raping

--shoves him roughly away

MICHELINE (CONT )
Still I must admit you took it like a
man

MURNAU
Youre the only one Ive ever allowed

INT BERLIN TRAIN STATION -- DAY

The crew of Nosferatu loads boxes onto one of the trains under
the watchful eye of GALEEN GRAU and MULLER

Suddenly theres a disturbance 0S and MURNAU--lapels pulled

of newspaper reporters He grabs PAUL

MURNAU
You work for me dont you

PAUL
Yes Herr Doctor

MURNAU

As PAUL begins directing the porters MURNAU turns to GRAU

MURNAU (CONT)
Tell them nothing

--then leaps onto the train GRAU faces the reporters
GRAU
Gentlemen I am Albin Grau Producer

and art director of this picture

REPORTER 1
Wheres Murnau
REPORTER 3
Is it true Murnau is filming Stokers
Dracula

GRAU

Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau is Germanys
greatest filmmaker--in a class with
such masters as Griffith and
Eisenstein At present he is
supervising every detail of this
unique on-location expedition
Exactly how unique youll discover
when the picture premieres in Berlin
And at that time Im certain youll
be convinced beyond the shadow of a
doubt of the exceptional talent of
this remarkable genius

The reporters clamor for more GRAU climbs onto the train

GALEEN
You did that quite well Albin

GRAU

In the future I think there might

actually be a living to be made from

this sort of thing Representative to

the press
The last of the luggage is brought aboard a whistle blows
people make their farewells the train pulls out of the
EXT TRAIN STATION -- CONTINUOUS

«roars out of the city

INT TRAIN -- MURNAUS COMPARTMENT -- DAY

CLOSE ON MURNAU asleep The door opens MULLER peeks in
Sees MURNAU sleeping closes it again

INT TRAIN -- CORRIDOR -- CONTINUOUS

MULLER moves down the corridor to the

INT TRAIN -- CREW COMPARTMENT -- CONTINUOUS

where he finds the rest of the crew at lunch GRAU GALEEN
and PAUL (met earlier) and three young women ELKE (cos-
tumes) MARIA (script) and EVA (make-up)

MULLER enters sits Tosses a rolled-up map to GRAU

GRAU
Still asleep

MULLER
Yes Must have been quite a night

GALEEN
Albin lets see the map

»ewho clears off a place on the steamer trunk acting as a
table and unrolls a large map of CentralEastern Europe

GRAU
Well cross the border into
Czechoslovakia in a few hours at the
foothills of the Carpathians and
continue until the line ends at
Oravska Magura From there well go
by automobile to a place near Poprad
in the Vysoke Tatry the High Tatra
Mountains

GALEEN
Apparently Herr Doctors already
filmed some of the exteriors there

MULLER
He has

GALEEN
You didnt know

MULLER
No

GALEEN

Thats odd Anyway you can assume
well be filming all of Hutters
scenes there the carriage scenes
the scenes at the inn with the
superstitious natives
Enter GUSTAV

GRAU
--the scenes between him and the
vampire

PAUL
I still dont understand why were not
going to Tranyslvania

EVA
Yes everyone knows Count Dracula
lives in Transylvania

GALEEN
Strictly speaking this isnt Dracula
The authors widow refused to sell us
the rights to the novel Shes hoping
to prepare a stage version to open in
London

GRAU
Bound to make more money than any
film

MULLER
Which is all very interesting Henrik
But it doesnt address the larger
question

GALEEN
Which is

MULLER
Whos playing our vampire

VON WANGENHEIM the actor portraying Hutter

GUSTAV
His name is Schreck

GALEEN
Schreck

GUSTAV
Max Schreck Apparently he was in the
Reinhardt company Did you know him
Albin

GALEEN
Schreck Are you sure you have the
name right Schreck is dialect for
shriek What did he specialize in
fright roles

GUSTAV
Just a character actor Max Schreck

MULLER
Who told you he was playing the
vampire

GUSTAV
Herr Doctor told me

GRAU
I didnt know any Max Schreck in the
Reinhardt company

GUSTAV
Herr Doctor told me he studied with
Stanislavsky in Moscow

GRAU
Im surprised Ive never heard of him

GALEEN
Hes from the Russian school then

GUSTAV
Yes As part of his preparation he
submerges his own personality in that
of the character hes portraying
Thats the reason hes not traveling
with us Herr Doctor told me went on
to Czechoslovakia weeks ago--in order
to absorb the flavor of the place I
suppose

GALEEN
God you dont think hes been
sleeping in a coffin

GUSTAV
Herr Doctor also told me that once we
arrive and begin filming Max will
never appear to us except in full
costume and make-up

GRAU
A rather extreme interpretation of
Stanislavsky if you ask me Why
wasnt I told about this

GUSTAV
--and that furthermore well film him
only at night

MULLER
Why wasnt I told about that

GRAU
(looking out the window)
There are the Carpathians Our first
sunset inwhats the script say
Henrik
GALEEN
The country of blood-red mountains
EXT TRAIN -- SUNSET
The sun sets behind the train as it races into the dense
forests of Eastern Europe

INT TRAIN CORRIDOR -- NIGHT

Later The corridor is packed with sleeping peasants

INT CREW COMPARTMENT -- NIGHT

Everyone is nodding off except for GRAU who casts on the
steamer trunk tarot cards the fool death the ten of
swords Suddenly the door opens Enter MURNAU

MURNAU
I see were knee-deep in peasants
MULLER
When did you wake up
MURNAU
(sitting)

The Czech guard woke me at the border
What have you been doing

MULLER
Actually weve been talking about you

GALEEN
Your previously shot footage your
heretofore unannounced additions to
the acting company

GRAU
As the producer of this film Herr
Doctor I feel I have a responsibility
(MORE )
MURNAU leans

MURNAU looks

GRAU (contd)
to ask if theres anything else youve
neglected to tell us

MURNAU
Why What do the cards say

GRAU
Someone close to us will be going on a
long journey Now answer my question

forward conspiratorially

MURNAU
Look I confess there are things I
havent told you about this
production But theyll all be
revealed in the course of time

MULLER
But how do you expect us to do our
jobs when were kept in the dark

at them turns his intense focus on his

especially GRAU They hang on his every word

Suddenly the

MURNAU
Exactly Let me explain something to
you I intend ours to be the most
realistic movie ever made And what
is realism The unexpected Thats
why I took all of you out of the
studio and thrust you into the world
So that youll be forced to react
spontaneously to whatever you
encounter there And because of it
Nosferatu will not be just another
filmed stage play It will bea
truthful record of reality And that
is what will make it great

GALEEN
But this is a fiction A movie about
a vampire How can you talk about
realism when the subject is so far
removed from reality

MURNAU
My sense of style is realism But my
sense of art is moral I want to
explore evil with the eye of a
scientist

train jolts to a stop

crew-—

MURNAU (CONT)
Whats that Why are we stopping

GRAU reaches over to the window opens the blind looks out
Then he looks back at the others in awe

GRAU
My god

EXT TRAIN -- NIGHT

CLOSE ON the water reservoir being lowered onto the trains
boiler (evidently this is why the train stopped) We pull
back and up to see the passengers disgorging from the steaming
train (for a smoke to stretch their legs etc) and then we
see what it is that inspired such awe in GRAU

EXT FOREST -- CONTINUOUS

From above A vast impenetrable forest lining the edges of
the railroad track like an enormous black curtain

On the ground We follow MURNAU GRAU GALEEN and MULLER as
they walk through the trees in silent wonder Until

MURNAU
The forest primeval It grows thicker
as we move east towards the Tatras

MULLER
How do expect me to film in there

MURNAU
We could use an aeroplane

MULLER
Youre the pilot Herr Doctor--at
least you were in the last war But I
doubt even a low-flying Fokker could
see into it

MURNAU
Theres no place on earth like it
None of its been thoroughly mapped
Whole armies have marched in never to
be heard from again And then there
are theanimals--strange things
which by all rights should be extinct

MURNAU lost in thought continues along by himself while we
catch up with

PAUL

and the rest the crew (ELKE EVA MARIA) walking along through
the woods EVA stops to pick up a pine cone walks a little
distance by herself And then stops Her eyes opening wide
in horror

EXT TRAIN -- AS BEFORE

e-her scream echoing through the trees before its swallowed
up again by the forest

Hearing it the train crew grab lamps hurry in her direction
followed by some of the peasants and the rest of the

EXT FOREST -- CONTINUOUS

-efilm crew (except for MURNAU) who following the lamps
make their way through the thick tangle of undergrowth
GALEEN in the lead MULLER taking up the rear

When suddenly the latter is caught up short when something
grabs him by the throat And yanks him into the darkness
without a sound

EXT TRAIN -- AS BEFORE

A few moments later the search party emerges from the woods
carrying EVAs body They set it down near the tracks begin
examining the body by lamplight while a few peasant women
gather around speak softly in Slovak

One of the things we hear them they say isnosferatu

Hearing it GALEEN looks at the other members of the film
crew And thats when MURNAU emerges from the woods hurries
to the body pushes everyone else away

MURNAU
Get away from her Shes my
responsibility

Somebody produces a sheet MURNAU himself wraps her body and
then supervises the others as they load it onto the train
like a ghost through the steam

Then the whistle blows the remaining people climb onboard

INT TRAIN -- NIGHT

We follow GRAU down the corridor--past the crew cabin (where
the dispirited crew take their seats) past peasants clut-
ching their rosaries and scribbling crosses everywhere--to a
door (without a cross) He knocks gently opens it

INT MULLERS COMPARTMENT -- CONTINUOUS

A little light from the corridor reveals MULLER in bed

GRAU
Wolf are you alright

MULLER
(dazed)
Uh-huh
GRAU
Wolf Isorry to wake you Good
night

And then door closes taking with it the light

INT CREW CABIN -- DAY

The train jerks to a stop waking the sleeping (under coats and
blankets) crew They stir PAUL opens the window shade

Beneath an overcast sky a small procession passes carries
EVAs enshrouded body Revealing behind them MURNAU
standing beside a pair of touring cars Paying off some kind
of police official

EXT CZECH TRAIN STATION -- DAY

A gabled building at the foot of the looming Tatras The
place is deserted except for the pall bearers and the film
crew--the latter loading the cars with equal solemnity

GALEEN walks up to MURNAU as EVA is loaded onto a horse cart

MURNAU
Theyll put her on the next train back
to Berlin Ive sent a telegram to
her parents

GALEEN
What do we do now Herr Doctor

Beat All eyes turn to MURNAU

MURNAU
We go on

INT TRAIN CORRIDOR -- DAY

As the last of the passengers disembark PAUL stops at
MULLERs door Knocks

PAUL
Herr Muller

No answer He knocks again

PAUL (CONT )
Herr Muller

The door opens slowly as if by itself And we see MULLER
bundled to the gills sitting at the window gaunt dark
rings under his eyes

EXT TRAIN STATION -- AS BEFORE

As the crew prepares to depart a little boy hands MURNAU a
wooden cage MURNAU gives him a coin the boy runs away

GRAU
Whats that

MURNAU holds up the cage rats

GALEEN
Rats There arent any rats called
for in the script until the ghost
ship the vampires disembarkation at

Bremen

MURNAU
Theyre for mood Henrik At the
castle

The train whistle blows and it pulls out of the station
Revealing MULLER standing nonplussed on the opposite side

GRAU
Wolf

MULLER turns walks slowly towards them

GRAU (CONT )
Wolf whats the matter with you

MULLER climbs silently into one of the cars followed by
MURNAU GALEEN and PAUL The others climb into the other
one drive up alongside

GUSTAV
You take the rats

He throws the cage into MURNAUs car which takes the lead As
the cars disappear into the forest we remain behind for just
a moment with the cart with the corpse

EXT FOREST -- CONTINUOUS

The cars follow the heavily shaded road into the mountains

INT GRAUS CAR -- CONTINUOUS

GUSTAV

GUSTAV roots around in the boxes in the back He opens one
packed with straw Digs out a bottle filled with blood

GUSTAV (CONT )
What in hell is this

GRAU
My god its blood It must be part
of the make-up

GUSTAV
Dont you think you can carry realism
too far
EXT DELL -- SUNSET

As the sun sets over the mountains behind them the cars
emerge from the forest and stop in front of a large stone
cottage with an attached stable A large white cross has been
whitewashed on the thatched roof of the building

They begin unloading equipment the INNKEEPER marches out

INNKEEPER
Good evening Herr Doctor

-and directs them inside

INT INN -- CONTINUOUS

Long wooden tables

a large hearth providing the only light

Seeing the crew a couple of old women at their beads
interrupt their prayers begin setting out crockery etc

MULLER
(to the Innkeeper)

I wonder if I might be shown to my

room

GALEEN

Youre not eating Wolf

But he ignores him

He hesitates for a moment goes inside

INT CRYPT -- CONTINUOUS

The cave turns out to be a series of Christian catacombs We
follow the figure past the primitive symbols cut into its
black walls until he stops in front of a dark niche

Then he gingerly sets down the cage containing the rats and
hurries back out As the music grows very loud

A PAIR OF HANDS

spiders around the cage Withdraw with it into the dark

speak his name--nosferatu the
unclean the undead--lest you evoke
the creature itself

The INNKEEPERS WIFE peeks in from the hall behind MURNAU

GRAU

(to the Innkeepers Wife)

EXT DARK ARCHWAY -- NIGHT

GUSTAV unnerved rushes back while SCHRECK unnoticed by the
others disappears back into the shadows

GUSTAV
What the fuck was that

MURNAU

response from me It was unfair it
was unethical and it wasit was

GRAU

GALEEN
Yes Well done Gustav

MULLER

GUSTAV looks at them in disbelief and then off their awed
reaction

GUSTAV

MURNAU

doubt

MURNAU
Thats enough of that Gustav Now
listen to me both of you for the
remainder of the shoot Max will be
Count Orlock He will not break
character he will not answer
questions as Max Schreck

GALEEN
Will he answer questions as the
vampire

MURNAU
Just leave him alone Henrik The man
will be absolutely authentic without
any phony effects Hell be the
vampire well film it and thatll be
that

GALEEN
Sounds like a lunatic to me

GUSTAV
No Ive heard about these Russian-—
trained actors Still if the son of
a bitch tries to suck my blood in the
name of verisimilitude

GALEEN
Oh for chrissakes Friedrich dont
quote my script back at me

MURNAU
All right what do you think it is

GALEEN
You heard the woman--nosferatu

MURNAU
Henrik thats the kind of thing Id
expect from Albin not you

GALEEN
Look I concede it may not be a
monster who casts no reflection ina
mirror but why couldnt it be some
deranged person who haunts these woods
and has succeeded in scaring these
people to death

MURNAU
Weve driven thirty kilometers to-
night How exactly did this deranged
person follow us

GUSTAV
Wellwhat about Schreck

GALEEN
Yes what about him

MURNAU
Youre not agreeing with
(indicating Gustav)
-e-him now are you Max Schrecks a
character actor from Berlin I admit
his preparation is odd

GALEEN
Odd enough to get so deep inside his
vampire character that he forgets Max
Schreck altogether

GUSTAV
God knows I forgot

MURNAU
Schrecks peculiarities are like
lovemaking games you believe them
while theyre happening but you always
stop before anyone is seriously hurt

GALEEN
You would know

GUSTAV
Nevertheless I intend to put all of
those crosses back up in my room

GUSTAV goes off to bed followed by GRAU and GALEEN MURNAU
remains at the table staring into the candlelight

INT CRYPT -- NIGHT

From behind a figure (SCHRECK but we dont see his face)
sits at a table reading by candlelight On the floor around
him are mountains of old rotting books

OS we hear a car drive up a door closing Footsteps The
figure closes his book with white tapering fingers

SCHRECK
(breathing with difficulty)
The woods decay the woods decay and
fall The vapors weep their burthen to
the ground

Another figure (we cant see who it is) enters and nervously
sets a bottle of blood on the table

SCHRECK (CONT)
Dinner You set a very mean table

SCHRECK picks up the bottle

SCHRECK (CONT )
No rats

-and begins clicking his fingernails against it

SCHRECK (CONT)
There was a time when I was fed from
golden chalices but nowdont look
at me that way Ive told you in my
old age I feed erratically

The first figure leaves

-often enormously

EXT ORLOCKS CASTLE -- EVENING

Sunset GRAU and GALEEN examine papers spread across the hood
of one of the cars

GALEEN
How much more Albin

GRAU

(looking at the schedule)
Well were already finished at the
inn and theyre wrapping up the Czech
exteriors today If the scenes inside
the castle go as smoothly I dont see
any reason why we shouldnt be filming
in Wismar in a fortnight and onto
Helgoland a fortnight after that
Ever been there Helgoland

GALEEN
No

GRAU
A cold little dune in the North Sea

GALEEN
I was just wondering how much longer
Wolf will be able to hold up

He seems better Herr Doctors kept
me away from him but he remembers
nothing from the night of his attack

As he says it the second car lurches up The other men climb
out

GRAU
Howd it go

Well do two scenes here tonight the
first where Hutter dines with the

to the more dramatic of the two

of the arc lights) The crew freezes watches him In turn
he watches them--especially the women

MURNAU hurries back in

MURNAU

(breathless relieved)
Ah there you are For those of you
who havent met him this is Max
Schreck who will be portraying our
vampire Count Orlock As youve no
doubt heard Maxs method is a bit
unconventional I expect you all to
respect his artistry in this matter
All right places everybody Orlock

SCHRECK sits at the end of the table leers at the under-
standably uncomfortable women MURNAU walks over to GUSTAV

MURNAU

SCHRECK takes off his turban Then she puts on a medical
magnifier picks up a stick of greasepaint Stops Trans-
fixed SCHRECK on the other hand is utterly intrigued

Thank you Orlock for pointing out
the technical deficiencies of our
young art form Talk to him Henrik
You two seem to be getting along

MURNAU
Listen to me Henrik The film cant
survive a long interruption The
financiers would take control and
finish it themselves And even if
they didnt it would ruin the spirit
Ive worked so hard to instill We
would need to begin again with
entirely new personnel

Are you even listening to yourself

MURNAU
Actually this may be propitious
Death can be used Gustavs never

INT CRYPT -- NIGHT

Once again a figure reads by candlelight And once again
we hear footsteps 0S and a second figure enters

SCHRECK
The woods decay the woods decay and
fall The vapors weep their burthen to
the ground Man comes and tills the
field and lies beneath And after many
a summer dies the swan

FIGURE (MURNAU)
How could you be so stupid

SCHRECK
Me only cruel immortality consumes I
wither slowly in thine arms Here at
the quiet limit of the world--

FIGURE (MURNAU)
Stop reciting that damned poem

The seated figure sits forward and we get our first real look
at MAX SCHRECK eyes bloodshot teeth yellow skin tissue-
thin over a skein of black veins This isnt movie make-up

SCHRECK
Did you think you could appease me
with rats Herr Doctor

At that the figure slams his hands onto the table it is
indeed MURNAU

MURNAU
You killed my photographer you fool

SCHRECK
Alas for this gray shadow once a man
Or even bottles of blood

MURNAU
Stop acting so pleased with yourself

SCHRECK
Did I kill one of your people Murnau
I cant remember

MURNAU
We had an arrangement

SCHRECK
Dont pretend you mourn for the man
Herr Doctor I know you

MURNAU
You monster why him Dont you
understand the film cant go on
without him There are others less
indispensable Why not the script-
girl Why not

SCHRECK
Ah Perhaps Ill eat the scriptgirl
later

MURNAU
Our bargain You agreed not to hurt
my people

SCHRECK grabs MURNAUs arm For an instant we see just how
afraid he really is of SCHRECK

SCHRECK
I think you forget our bargain
-e-and then he yanks his arm away puts some distance

himself and the vampire

No answer

Nothing

MURNAU
Listen to me I have to go to Berlin
to get another photographer You must
control yourself while Im away

SCHRECK
I dont think we need the writer any
longer

MURNAU
Hes necessary Theyre all
necessary do you understand

SCHRECK
I dont think the ship is necessary

MURNAU
The ship What are you talking about
There are a dozen scenes on the ship

SCHRECK
But I wont sail

MURNAU
Why didnt you tell me this before

MURNAU (CONT )
How else is the vampire suppose to get
to Bremen

MURNAU (CONT)
(exasperated)
Oh all right Ill think of
something Just dont hurt my people

SCHRECK
Or else what

MURNAU
Dont think I cant harm you

SCHRECK
Tell me how you would harm me When
even I am not certain how I could harm
myself

between

MURNAU
I can harm you by not giving you what
you want
(off Schrecks reaction)
Yes forget again whos in charge here
at your own risk Now abide by our
contract-—-and I will too

MURNAU storms out SCHRECK watches him go Then he pulls out
the locket he stole the one with GRETAs picture in it

INT HUTTER

SCHRECK
But thy strong Hours indignant workd
their wills And beat me down and
marrd and wasted me And tho they
could not end me left me maimd To
dwell in presence of immortal youth
Immortal age beside immortal youth
And all I was in ashes

How ‘bout Poland

INT ORLOCKS CASTLE -- NIGHT

GALEEN and GRAU are sprawled out drunk in one of the court-
yards of Orlocks castle Moonlight illuminates two empty
bottles of schnapps at their feet They pass the third

GALEEN
Albin whats the most wondrous thing
youve ever seen
GRAU
I saw ectoplasm once

GALEEN
Whats that Ectoplasm

GRAU
Its the mystical substance of ghosts
I saw a spiritualist pull it out of
his mouth in Italy

GALEEN
What did it look like

GRAU
Seaweed

GALEEN
Is that what were suppose to look
like when we die

GRAU
I hope not What about you What was
the most wondrous thing you ever saw

GALEEN
(conspiratorially)
I saw Greta Schroeder naked

GRAU
No

GALEEN
Yes

GRAU

Beats ectoplasm

Suddenly SCHRECK emerges from the darkness

GALEEN
Jesus Max you scared me to death

GRAU
How long have you been listening
there

GALEEN
Weve been searching this place all
day for your coffin

GRAU
Maybe this isnt his resting place

GALEEN
You know youre right I wouldnt
let cameras into my house Didnt we
have something to say to him

SCHRECK walks over to them glares menacingly Theyre too
drunk to notice

GRAU
Silent fucker isnt he

GALEEN
»something about Herr Doctor

GRAU
Right MaxFriedrich Wilhelm
Murnau the great white hope of the
German film industry has gone to
Berlin to fetch a new photographer

GALEEN
Wolfs dead
GRAU
So you can take the funny ears off
GALEEN
Albin Please The mans an artist
GRAU
Hes still in character Thats
dedication
GALEEN

Hey ask him some vampire questions

GRAU
All right Count Orlockis your
name really Count Orlock

SCHRECK
I cant recall

SCHRECK sits next to them They hand him the bottle he
sniffs at it takes a sip In the dark only his head and
hands really show

GRAU
When did you first become a vampire

GALEEN
Where were you born Or were you
born
SCHRECK
I cant remember

He takes another drink

GRAU
This isnt any fun

GALEEN
Do you think Count Dracula forgot

SCHRECK
I read that book Murnau gave it to
me

GALEEN

Well this is quite an opportunity
Speaking as a vampire what is your
opinion of the books technical

merits

SCHRECK
It made me sad

GRAU
Why

SCHRECK

Because Dracula had no servants

GRAU
I think you missed the point of that
book Orlock

SCHRECK
Dracula hasnt had servants in four
hundred years And then a man comes
to his ancestral home and he must
convince him that hes stillthat
hes like the man He has to feed
him when he himself hasnt eaten food
in centuries Can he even remember
how to buy bread How to select
cheese and wine

GRAU
Speaking of which

SCHRECK takes a pull passes the bottle

SCHRECK
And then he has to remember the rest
of it how to prepare a meal how to
(MORE )

SCHRECK (contd)
make a bed He remembers his past
glory--his armies his retainers--and
what he is reduced to The loneliest
moment in the book is when the man
accidentally sees Dracula setting his
table

-gets the bottle back drinks Hes starting to sway

GRAU
If youre so lonely why dont
youmake more vampires

SCHRECK
I cant Im too old Although I
seem to recall that I was never able
to

GALEEN
How did you become a vampire

SCHRECK
It was a woman

GALEEN
Now were getting somewhere

GRAU
What woman

SCHRECK

My wife My first and only wife

GRAU
She was a vampire

SCHRECK
I dont know She was my child bride
She went into labor with our first
child I was not permitted to see her
in this condition Perhaps she died--
I know the baby did But she returned
to me that night And after that I
only saw her at night And then I
grew ill and became after many many
years what I am now

He starts to break down Drinks more A bat flutters by
SCHRECK grabs it bites into it GALEEN and GRAU watch in
astonishment too drunk to realize the danger theyre in

GALEEN
Schreck the German theater needs you

SCHRECK finishes with the bat theres blood on his chin and
he looks even sadder than before

SCHRECK
We were together in the night and then
she left me At first I hada
painting of her on wood And then I
had a relief of her in marble And
then I had a picture of her in my
mind And now I no longer even have
that What was I saying

GRAU
Easy with the bottle there old boy

SCHRECK
This is the schnapps they make in
these parts I havent tasted it
in

He drops the bottle bolts to his feet Then he looks at the
two men and lurches away GALEEN retrieves the bottle wipes
off its mouth in disgust They laugh

INT MURNAUS APARTMENT (STUDY) -- NIGHT

MURNAU half-dressed talks on the phone at the same time he
excitedly arranges his office as a screening room arranging
chairs setting up a screen etc

MURNAU
(into the phone)
I dont care what theyre paying you
Greta we have a contract
GretaGretalook What is it you
really want

He steps behind his desk begins loading film onto a movie
projector sitting there Too distracted to notice that
someones listening to him from the doorway

MURNAU (CONT)
Its to live forever isnt it To be
beautiful and brilliant until the end
of time Well the stage cant do that
for you Because in the course of a
few generations there wont be a
living soul to remember what you did
on it Only film can make you
immortal Greta Do you understand
Only I can make you immortal
GretaGreta

MURNAU (CONT) (contd)
(at wits end)
«-e-oh all right Ill match their pay

He slams the receiver onto its cradle looks up to see

MICHELINE--wearing a diaphanous gown carrying a bottle of
champagne--framed in the archway leading to the hall The
effect is not unlike that of Orlock when first we saw him

MURNAU (CONT)
Hold it What a shot

He makes a little finger viewfinder She walks up to him
kisses him He pulls her down on top of him with a bang

MICHELINE
Herr Doctor can I make it better

MURNAU
Yes you can kiss my bruises Better
still beat me black and blue and then
kiss them

MICHELINE
No you hit me first

MURNAU
No you hit me

They wrestle around on the floor end up in a long embrace
She rolls on top of him and grabs him by the throat

MICHELINE
Enough of this mystery Why are you
back so soon And dont tell me its
just to placate Greta Schroeder

MURNAU
Youre hurting me

MICHELINE
Youre checking up on my faithfulness
is that it

MURNAU
I came back to see you I couldnt
stand to be away

She rolls off him laughing Pours a glass of champagne for
herself (MURNAU doesnt drink)

MURNAU (CONT)
And I have a surprise for you

MICHELINE
I hate surprises What is it

MURNAU climbs to his feet fumbles with the projector

MURNAU
My movie

He finishes with the projector kneels in front of her

MURNAU (CONT)
Do you remember that book you gave me

MICHELINE
What book

MURNAU
Dracula

MICHELINE

(suspicious)

Yes

MURNAU

Ive filmed it Or Id begun
tountil Wolf died

MICHELINE
Then its true what theyre saying in
the papers

MURNAU

You cant know what a nightmare its
been Between the financiers and the
crew andthe rest of it But Ive
gone too far to stop now Im here to
find another photographer Then I go
back to the Carpathians

(returning to the projector)
-and then from there to Wismar on
the Baltic And finally to Helgoland
in the North Sea And then at last
Ill come back to you

MICHELINE
--youve filmed Dracula

He turns on the movie (the scene where Orlock menaces Hutter
outside his room in the castle) MURNAU watches from beside
the projector MICHELINE sits quickly faces the screen

MURNAU
This is the vampire the first time we
see him as he is not trying to act

human

MICHELINE
What have you done Friedrich Hes
so ugly

MURNAU

Hes perfect
MURNAU watches for a moment when suddenly the phone rings

Deflated (evidently its GRETA again) he hurries out to
answer it elsewhere While we stay with

MICHELINE

The dirge begins again the scene projected on the screen cuts
to more images of the sun setting And we look at her face
mesmerized by the sight of the sun Like SCHRECKs

From above we glide silently over the forest a thread of
phosphorescent mist woven through the trees Eventually
pinpricks of light appear in the breaks in the canopy and it
becomes evident that a

From ground level mob of peasants--carrying torches leading
dogs--is moving across the forest floor Following them is
the remaining film company car

Suddenly the forest is illuminated from above Theres a loud
chopping sound the car pulls to a stop as a

FOKKER

a WWI tri-plane swoops low above them It circles and lands
in a clearing hemmed-in by sheer cliffs the plane cuts its
engines the pilot climbs out MURNAU

cant get much better than this

GRAU gestures to where the dogs are baying and we see

RUINS
were not sure weve seen before
obscured by vines carved into the
living rock The mob stops in front
of it kneels as a priest climbs its
stairs and solemnly begins praying

Suddenly from inside theres a blood-freezing scream

MURNAU
Weve got to get in there

GALEEN
Are you crazy Im not going in
there

And thats when we notice the figure (WAGNER) in the Fokkers
passenger seat He climbs into the pilot seat cocks the
planes machine guns And fires

RUINS -- AS BEFORE

-ricocheting bullets off the fagade in a shower of dust
Chasing away the priest Scattering the peasants Silence
A dog howls theres another scram from inside

The dumbfounded crew watch as the figure leaps out of the
plane peels off his goggles hes in his early 30s tall and
blonde wearing military uniform complete with sidearm

WAGNER
Ill go in there

MURNAU
Meet our new photographer Fritz Arno
Wagner

GALEEN

What in hell was that all about

WAGNER
Just a demonstration I get impatient
waiting for the mumbo jumbo to end if
you know what I mean Now why dont
you hold onto this and Ill get my
camera

He reaches into the plane pulls out a large metal canister
stenciled Giftgas

GALEEN
What is it

GRAU
Its from the war Mustard gas

WAGNER retrieves his cameratripod hoists it onto his
shoulder climbs down from the plane and then heads in the
direction of the ruins

GRAU (CONT )
(to Murnau)
I like this guy

»ewith the rest of the men in tow The peasants clear a path
for them at the entrance to the ruins WAGNER sets up his
camera takes the canister from GALEEN twists something
tosses it inside Begins filming

An instant later theres a flash and an explosion Parts of
the fagade clatter to the earth smoke and bats belch out the
entrance the mob shrieks and runs away

GALEEN
You ass Theres a baby in there

WAGNER
(still filming)
Nothing to fear

MURNAU
Its just a harmless smoke bomb

After a few moments the smoke clears and the crew--along with
a few local men--go inside

INT RUINS -- CONTINUOUS

Part cave part ruins stalactites drip from the ceiling
brick archways lead into dark recesses The men move
gingerly squinting through the smoke stepping over the
stunned bats squeaking on the ground Suddenly the dogs
snarl

-and a figure--coughing bellowing--staggers from the
shadows MURNAU takes a step toward him but before he
reaches him WAGNER manages to draw his gun Shoots the
figure winging him in the shoulder The figure chokes drops
into the smoke still clinging to the ground

GRAU
I thought you needed a wooden stake to
do that

MURNAU rushes to the body turns it over
CLOSE ON an ashen-faced man with jagged teeth and a shaved

head But it isnt SCHRECK--although the man seems to have
disfigured himself in order to resemble him

MURNAU
stands breathes a private sigh of
relief

MURNAU

Well Henrik Heres your lunatic who
thinks hes a vampire

Just then a baby cries the dogs bark A few of the men race
into one of the dark recesses

EXT RUINS -- AS BEFORE

»e-and emerge carrying the (healthy) baby and the (wounded)
vampire PAUL walks up to MURNAU et al

PAUL
Theyre saying it was the son of a
widow who recently died Nota
vampire at all Just some local
driven crazy by grief or something

At that an old peasant women walks up to MURNAU For a
moment we think shes about to offer congratulations But
instead she lets rip a torrent of unintelligible abuse that
ends with her spitting on the ground

Shes followed by a few others who cross themselves at the
sight of WAGNER (and especially his camera) before heading
off The crew watches then gathers by the plane

WAGNER
Damn end of reel You know I could
film this in slow motion and it would
be incredibly moving

GRAU
Whats that Slow motion

WAGNER
I run the film through the camera too
fast That way when its projected

WAGNER (contd)
at normal speed things appear to be
moving unnaturally slow It gives
everything a kind of resonance

MURNAU
Fritz is a genius at the mechanics of
trick photography Its too bad he
wont have a chance to demonstrate his
more esoteric skills in this
production

Everyone exitsexcept MURNAU who contemplating his goggles
bridles under WAGNERs usurpation of his control

A moment later GUSTAV returns to retrieve a lost pair of
gloves Looks at MURNAU for a moment

GUSTAV
What do you expect Herr Doctor When
things go wrong people prefer generals
to oracles

»ethen he picks up an oil lantern leads MURNAU out As his
light fades out on the stairs SCHRECK climbs out of the
coffin follows
INT ORLOCKS CASTLE -- CONTINUOUS
MURNAU catches up with the others

WAGNER

Herr Doctor Ive got a great idea for
the next scene

MURNAU
Please Fritz just film it the way I
want

GRAU

What is it Fritz

MURNAU
(exasperated)
Lets not even discuss it

WAGNER

(to Murnau)
I thought you were open to the
unexpected

(to Grau)
All right in this scene the vampire
is loading his coffins onto a cart in
order to ship himself to Germany
right What if I run the film through
the camera a few frames per second too
slow

GRAU
Then when the film is projected at
the normal speed Count Orlock appears
to be moving incredibly fast

ORLOCKS CASTLE -- COURTYARD -- CONTINUOUS

They emerge in an outer courtyard opening onto the woods

WAGNER
And then listen to this we finish
the scene with stop-motion animation
Orlock climbs into an open coffin the
coffin lid scrambles up all by it-
selfand closes on top of him

GRAU
Then the driverless wagon pulls away
as if by occult intervention Its
perfect

Waiting for them is a horsecart and a pile of plain wooden
PAUL adjusts a light from a window above SCHRECK
examines the coffins

MURNAU

WAGNER
That wasnt my way Herr Doctor That
was in the script right Henrik

MURNAU
Its merely a display of technical
virtuosity An obvious falsehood An
illusion

WAGNER
Herr Doctor youre the Renaissance
man not me Havent you read Plato
The illusion is the shadow on the
wall The reality is the thing which
casts the shadow in the first place
in this instance a piece of celluloid
a few millimeters in width Anything
can happen on the celluloid anything
can be engineered there Because
thats the only reality

SCHRECK
Im tired of your sophisms It will
be light shortly Lets get on with
it

MURNAU

WAGNER runs into the castle A few seconds later we see his
goggled face leaning out of the window with the camera

which you were interred They possess
all your power and they are the only
things that you will take with you

piece of chalk and mark the shot
Gustav make yourself useful and hold
the reins of this horse

Everyone jumps to his orders The significance of this does
not escape MURNAU who stands off to one side watching

Come on Henrik dont look so glum
One last shot and well all take a
little cruise to Wismar

As he bustles with authority we look up to see a remarkable
thing looming over the side of the ruined castle are the
prow and masts of a ship being constructed on the site

Then the opening dirge this time sung by a woman begins to

Fritzie

WAGNER
Thats right Fritzie

GRAU
Fritzie

GRETA takes WAGNER by the arm leads him upstairs

GUSTAV
Has anybody seen Maria

--followed by GUSTAV then GRAU

GALEEN
(shouting)
Albin will you come tonight

GRAU
(tired of arguing)
Yes yes Alright Henrik

GALEEN alone steps to the window Watches the sun set

EXT WISMAR -- NIGHT

We follow a figure down the crooked streets and into

INT CELLAR -- CONTINUOUS

A dirt floor books a coffin with a candle burning on top of
it SCHRECK sits beside it reading Enter

MURNAU
We leave tonight after you finish your
last scene here Were flying north
but west so there should be no
problem

SCHRECK
(not looking up)
Shes here isnt she The glorious
child

MURNAU
MURNAU looks

SCHRECK
I want to see her now

MURNAU
No I wont have you interfering with
her like you did poor Wolf

SCHRECK
And I wont act again for you until
you bring her to me

MURNAU
Dont you see youre ruining
everything for both of us As it is
everyone is about to bolt As far as
theyre concerned Im just like you
Im nosferatu

SCHRECK
You are nosferatu

at him shocked Beat
MURNAU

Greta is in your last scene Thats
when you can have her

SCHRECK
After my death scene
MURNAU
Yes
SCHRECK
Dont expect realism there Murnau
MURNAU
What do you mean
SCHRECK
(hisses)

Dont cheat me mortal Ill take her
anytime I please

MURNAU

Keep away from her Keep away from my

people Leave my movie alone

SCHRECK
This is hardly your movie anymore

MURNAU grabs SCHRECK by the throat pins him to the ground
At first we think hes strangling him but then we realize
that SCHRECKs sibilant wheezing is actually laughter

Suddenly his features go blank He grabs MURNAU lifts him
off the ground and throws him crashing into the wall He
scrambles to his feet

MURNAU
Wait until Helgoland Well make an
end of it there

flees SCHRECK remains behind chuckles quietly

EXT WISMAR -- SPIRITUALISTS -- NIGHT

GALEEN waits impatiently beneath a sign painted with occult
symbols Through the window we can see GRAU and WAGNER
watching an old man yank dough-like ectoplasm from his mouth

CLOCK

Close on a mechanical clock as it prepares to strike
midnight The gears mesh a door opens and a bronze devil
races out pursued by a bronze knight

EXT SPIRITUALISTS -- NIGHT

As the clock chimes 0S GRAU and WAGNER emerge from the
building and silently follow GALEEN

INT CELLAR -- AS BEFORE

The three men carrying lanterns gingerly enter the cellar
see the coffin WAGNER creeps up to it throws open the lid
Its empty Theres a general sigh of relief nervous
laughter WAGNER closes it sits lights a cigarette

WAGNER
How did you find this place

GALEEN
I followed Murnau here

GRAU
Oh Henrik Youre in the wrong part
of the building Theres probably a
sadistic brothel upstairs

WAGNER
Herr Doctor certainly has a talent for
finding awful places

GALEEN
The world is full of awful places

WAGNER
I dont understand you Henrik So
what if Schreck sleeps here I
thought he had thischaracter thing

GALEEN scoops up some dirt from beside the coffin

GALEEN
This is the dirt in which he was
interred This is his original
coffin He needs these things in
order to survive

WAGNER
Are you drunk

GALEEN
Just hear me out

As he continues 0S we follow--from a distance--the subject
of his monologue

EXT WISMAR -- NIGHT

--creeping through the twisting deserted streets of Wismar
Possibly heading back to the cellar where right now GALEEN
holds court

GALEEN (0S)
(continued)
Schreck is not an actor carried away
by his role Hes not even an actor
Hes a vampire a real vampire

As SCHRECK vanishes down one of the streets we return to

INT CELLAR -- AS BEFORE

GRAU
Henrik Im a well-known adept of the
occult sciences Dont you think if
he were really a vampire I would know
about it

WAGNER
Anyway there are no vampires

GALEEN
He ate a bat

GRAU
He was drunk I was drunk You were
drunk for chrissakes

GALEEN
Dont you understand Friedrich would
go to any lengths to render a movie
authentically For the Carpathians
he used the Carpathians For peasants
he used peasants For a ruined castle
he used a ruined castle Fora
vampirehe used a vampire There is
nothing he wouldnt do Nothing

They look at him Then WAGNER yawns looks at his watch

WAGNER
And I thought I might get a few hours
extra sleep when Murnau canceled the
shoot for tonight

GRAU
Im sorry Henrik I can see how this
disturbs you And I understand I
miss Wolf just as much as

GALEEN
You dont understand anything

-and heads up the stairs followed by GRAU
GALEEN
(calling after them)
Who else has to die in order to
convince you
We remain behind with GALEEN for a beat then follow him
upstairs

EXT WISMAR -- CONTINUOUS

--and outside He hurries away Just as SCHRECKs shadow
angles in behind him And follows him to the

EXT HOTEL -- CONTINUOUS

where GALEEN rings for the night attendant After a tense
moment the door opens GALEEN goes inside the attendant
shuts it behind him

INT HOTEL -- HALL -- NIGHT

Later A door opens and MARIA--nightgown candle--emerges
She shuts her door tiptoes to another knocks softly

MARIA
Gustav

The door opens a crack GUSTAV peeks out Smiles opens the
door for her and then shuts it again We continue down the
hall make a sharp turn toward the steps and discover

SCHRECK staggering up the stairs to the landing He looks
at the rows of doors and then slowly tries them--one after
another--finding them all locked Until by the time he

reaches the end hes crawling like an addict in withdrawal

Finally he comes to the last door reaches up for the knob
bears down on it It twists to pieces in his hand And the
door opens Inside we see the sleeping figure of GALEEN
SCHRECK crawls in the door silently closes behind him

We pull away from GALEENs room back in the direction of the
stairs And thats when we hear the scream But it isnt
GALEEN GRAU and WAGNER emerge from their respective rooms
rush down the hall batter down the door Revealing

GRETA
naked in bed laughing obscenely She
hisses at them something clinks onto
the floor GRAU holds up a candle
lifts the object a steel hypodermic

GRAU
What is it

WAGNER
(covering Greta)
Morphine

GRAU
Morphine Photography and
pharmaceuticals by Fritzie

WAGNER
Herr Doctor knows all about it

GRAU
Herr Doctor is always one step ahead
of us isnt he God for I moment
there I was afraid she

WAGNER
Shes all right Get some sleep We
have a long trip tomorrow

WAGNER takes the needle from GRAU pockets it They exit

EXT BREMEN -- NIGHT

Orlock lugging his coffin under one arm crosses the square
in front of an enormous gabled building

(Recreated from Nosferatu)

But just as he reaches the left foreground he does something
odd he looks up at us at the camera And thats when we
realize were shooting-day-for-night With MURNAU himself in
the make-up of his vampire

MURNAU
And--end

The iris twists to black theres the sound of an airplane
engine OS and
EXT OUTSIDE WISMAR -- DAY
-MURNAUs tri-plane taxis to the edge of the field and
ascends into the sky
EXT WISMAR -- HOTEL -- DAY
GRAU casts the tarot on an upended suitcase while GRETA--dark
glasses fur coat surrounded by luggage and lap dogs--lounges
on her steamer trunk
GALEEN heavily bundled sits by himself staring at nothing
GRAU
Henrik come here Ill cast your

fortune

Nothing
GRAU (CONT )
Whats wrong with you Youre acting
just like

- Wolf

The hotel door opens WAGNER steps out

WAGNER
Well hes gone

GRAU
Who

WAGNER

Gustav Maria too
WAGNER hands GRAU a piece of paper

GRAU
Theyve run off together

WAGNER
The porter gave me that They hired a
car and drove back to Berlin

GRETA
Typical

WAGNER
Can we proceed without him

GRAU
Well have to wont we

GRETA
If we need Gustav for anything else
Im sure we can always shanghai him in
Berlin

GRAU
Herr Doctors going to throw a fit

GRETA
He should have known Gustavs a
flake everyone in the Reinhardt
company knew that Let me tell you
something when I was married to
him

WAGNER
You were married to Reinhardt

GRETA
No Fritzie To Gustav

GRAU
You were married to Gustav When

GRETA
We were divorced last year

GRAU
Did Murnau know this

GRETA
Of course He said something about
wanting to cast man and wife as man
and wife Of course Ive already
married again but

GALEEN looks meaningfully at GRAU GRAU turns back to his

TAROT CARDS

the fool death the ten of swords--just as he had cast on the
train en route to Czechoslovakia

OS we hear the dirge followed this time by the sounds of
shore birds waves lapping against a beach Then off the
last of the three cards we dissolve to

EXT HELGOLAND -- BEACH -- DAYEVENING

GRETA as Ellen sits amid crosses and scrub grass looking out
at the sea

(Recreated from Nosferatu)

MURNAU (0S)
I wish the fog was a little thicker
Pop one of those smoke bombs will you
Fritz

WAGNER (0S)
Hardly a realistic effect Herr
Doctor

EXT HELGOLAND -- BEACH -- DAYEVENING
Same scene not recreated We pull back to see MURNAU

GALEEN and WAGNER standing by the camera While the latter
busies himself with a smoke bomb

WAGNER (CONT)
But I suppose after filming you day-
for-night dressed as the vampire--
anything is possible

MURNAU throws him a look addresses himself to GRETA

MURNAU
Ellen just keep thinking of your
husband possibly dead far away
(to Wagner)
All right--camera action Keep
filming Fritz Ellen wait for the
fog

WAGNER begins cranking the camera Enter GRAU

GRAU
Well I think I found our studio A
fortified bunker of all things Part
of our coastal defenses during the

last war

MURNAU
Good How long will it take to build
the set

GRAU
It shouldnt take more than a day or
two

GRETA

It bloody well better not

MURNAU
Keep looking out to sea Ellen Think
of your nightmares Your
premonitions

(to Grau)

All right Albin you and Fritz and
Henrik if hes up to it get to work
right away Theres Gretas crowded
schedule to consider

She waves MURNAU rolls his eyes puts on his goggles
MURNAU (CONT)
-and we only a week until the boat

from Cuxhaven returns

»-turns back to the scene

INT BUNKER -- EVENINGNIGHT

From the POV of the gallery its a dusty subterranean
building with shadowy recesses concrete pilasters grated
niches and an elevated gallery Of note is the principal
entrance a steel door on a system of weights and pulleys

Enter from one of the recesses GRAU carrying a roll of
blueprints Hes followed by WAGNER carrying the machine gun
from the plane and his cameratripod

WAGNER
Can we get any natural light in here

GRAU walks over to a hand-operated locking device Releases
it A chain plays out the counterbalances slide to the
ground and the door rolls into the ceiling with a crash--
opening onto an incline (evidently for loading purposes)

OS we hear wind the sound of the surf A column of late
afternoon light angles in

FOKKER -- EVENINGNIGHT

MURNAUs tri-plane sits on a barren wind-blown hill above the
little town--thatch-roofed huts a few brick buildings--that
constitutes civilization on the otherwise barren island

INT BUNKER -- NIGHTDAWN

MURNAU enters examines the half-built set for Ellens bed-
room--a stage wall with a window a chair a table a bed with
a mirror beside it--and then walks over to the door release
Opens it The door rolls up with a bang

GALLERY
waking GRAU and WAGNER who are
napping amid a jumble of equipment and
empty schnapps bottles GRAU roots
around for a full bottle WAGNER
begins to roll a cigarette From the
open door we hear the sound of the
surf the wind blowing

WAGNER
(peering down)
Whats Friedrich doing down there

GRAU
Who can fathom the ways of genius
Hey whats that

WAGNER
Hashish

He lights up passes it to GRAU Downstairs

MURNAU
stands looking out the door listening
to the wind and the waves When
suddenly a figure emerges from the fog-
shrouded night MURNAUs face lights
up with surprise

As MICHELINE emerges from the darkness The lights in the

bunker flicker imperceptibly she steps up to the amazed
MURNAU puts her arms around his neck kisses him

GRAU AND WAGNER

Watch in utter astonishment as

MURNAU

shuts the door again (reversed the door release cranks the
chain through the mechanism and locks it off) and then lets
himself be led by MICHELINE to the bed

MURNAU
How

MICHELINE
Shhh Dont say anything

She pushes him down on it and climbs on top of him They
begin tearing off each others clothes While

WAGNER
picks up his camera winds it up

WAGNER
(whispering)
Hand me that blanket

GRAU hands it to him
GRAU

(whispering)
What are you doing
94

WAGNER
Capturing reality I think Herr
Doctor would approve

GRAU
Thats disgusting

WAGNER
Think of the possibilities It could
be the movie of the future

WAGNER takes it wraps the camera in it (to muffle its
noise) Then he grabs his goggles begins filming

MURNAU AND MICHELINE

We watch them for a moment then we begin pulling back Only
to discover SCHRECK standing in the shadows beside a movie
projector Watching them

GRAU (0S)
Jesus Christ theres Max

As SCHRECK watches MICHELINE pulls off her slip and climbs on
top of MURNAU--facing away from him They fuck for a long
while then she stops a little Begins to pull away

MICHELINE
(breathlessly)
What time is it
MURNAU

Stay Theres nothing here for which
to leave me

MURNAU grabs her breasts from behind pulls her back to him

She turns around mounts him again throws her head back in
orgasm Revealing her features to

SCHRECK

who recoils stumbling back knocking into the projector
causing its carbon arc to ignite its gears to turn and
scenes from Nosferatu (Orlock leering at Ellen) to be
projected on the stage wall

MURNAU AND MICHELINE

begin scrambling for their clothes

SCHRECK
You

MURNAU
Max go the fuck away

But MURNAU isnt the one hes interested in Its

SCHRECK
Look at me Look at me

MICHELINE

who looks at him with an expression of pure ancient loathing

GRAU AND WAGNER

watch thunderstruck while

MURNAU

horrified--realizing--scuttles away from her off the bed
MICHELINE watches MURNAU calmly pulls her cape around
herself raises herself to her full height and

MICHELINE
(imperiously to Schreck)
You thing

SCHRECK
How beautiful youve remained Thou
wilt renew thy beauty morn by morn I
earth in earth forget these empty
courts

MICHELINE
What do you want

SCHRECK
After all these years Look whats
happened

MICHELINE
It happens to them all Youve aged

SCHRECK
Aged I am time itself
MICHELINE
(sneers)
And also evidently a movie actor

SCHRECK
I did it for you Ive begun losing
my sight my legs I can barely
travel past the borders of my land
So when Murnau asked me to act in his
movie I knew you would see it one
dayeven if it took centuries And
then you would come to me

MICHELINE
Why What would you have me do

SCHRECK
I wither slowly in thine arms Here at
the quiet limit of the world

MICHELINE

Youve lost your mind old man
SCHRECK

Come back to me Stay with me
MICHELINE

(laughs)

Stay with you Youre an insect
SCHRECK

Dont you recognize me
MICHELINE

Of course not
SCHRECK

I was your husband once Your first
husband

MICHELINE
That may be But I certainly dont
know you now Do you think I feel

responsible for you I feel nothing
for youor any of the others All
men are just time passing by for me

(to Murnau tenderly)
Herr Doctor

SCHRECK
Stay away from her Murnau

MICHELINE

(turning on him hissing)

Why are you still alive Why havent
you had the decency to die

SCHRECK
(to Murnau)
Shell make of you what she made of
me

MICHELINE
(venomously)
Dont listen to him Friedrich Hes
a non-being Someone I fucked a
million lovers ago

SCHRECK attacks her They fall against the stage wall which
pitches over so that the projected film now covers the entire
back wall of the bunker

She climbs to her feet easily shoves SCHRECK away He
hobbles back takes one last look at her At MURNAU Exits
into the shadowy recesses of the bunker

MICHELINE
(hurrying to Murnau)
Oh Friedrich Cant you see that I
love you Isnt that what you wanted
to hear I came here to warn you
You not him Dont listen to the
lies of the Assyrian

MURNAU
Assyrian

MICHELINE
He knows nothing Hes a jilted
lover Youve known jilted lovers
Theyre all repulsive He tricked you
into contacting me

MURNAU
But you gave me that book

MICHELINE
I didnt know you had stumbled upon
one of them I thought you might make
a romantic Draculathe way Ive
always dreamed of him

As MURNAU cringes away from her we CLOSE ON

She takes a step toward him as the

MURNAU

terrified crawls back onto the bed She looks at him

GRETA--drugged smiling incoherently--lies in bed touching
herself sensuously And

INT HELGOLAND INN -- GALEENS ROOM -- DAY

GALEEN--very pale clutching a cross--cowering weakly in bed

The door opens MURNAU peers fearfully out He looks close to
insanity hes shaking there are dark circles under his
eyes GRAU and WAGNER enter shut the door behind them

INT HELGOLAND INN -- MURNAUS ROOM -- CONTINUOUS

The room is trashed and MURNAU has scribbled crosses on the
walls the door etc He slumps down in bed WAGNER picks up
an empty vial on the bedside table sniffs it

WAGNER
Laudanum

MURNAU

(druggy)
There is no Max Schreck

They sit down on the bed with MURNAU who tells his story
calmly indifferently--as if he were speaking to himself

GRAU
Who is he then

MURNAU
I dont know

WAGNER

Where did you find him

MURNAU
In a book When I was a student It
told the story of a legendary line of
(MORE)
MURNAU (contd)
kings rumored to be vampires living
in Slovakia for eleven hundred years
I had forgotten all about it until she
gave me the other book Dracula I
found him when I went to scout
locations A vampire Living in an

old monastery

GRAU

What was your bargain with him

MURNAU

He would play the part of an actor
playing the part of a vampire

WAGNER
And what did you offer him

MURNAU

(looking up at them)

Greta

GRAU
How could you Friedrich

MURNAU
(nodding off)

I did it for science Dont you see
I didnt want the usual melodrama I
wanted to capture him for posterity

WAGNER
Hes fading

GRAU
Go to sleep Friedrich

MURNAU climbs under the blankets
MURNAU
Hell be out again tonight

is for two

-and his bloodshot eyes slowly close

The call

After a moment we

hear OS the door shut as GRAU and WAGNER exit

INT BUNKER -- DAY

From the gallery GRAU puts the finishing touches on the
(newly-restored) bedroom set Enter WAGNER
GRAU
Think its worth searching the island
again

WAGNER
(pulling up a seat)
No He could be under the sea for all
we know The only thing we can be
sure of is hell come out at night and
kill us allslowly or quickly
depending on his appetite

GRAU
What about his bargain with Murnau

WAGNER
His vampire bride is dead Thats the
only thing that mattered to him
Hell kill us then hell kill
everyone else on this island and then
hell stowaway on the boat back to
Germany

Beat They let this sink in

GRAU
You know Ive been thinking If
were going to die anyway we might as
well finish the movie Asa
testament

WAGNER
We can put the reels in beer kegs
lined with pitch Set them afloat
before he can get to them--that is if
he agrees to let us film him for the
last shot

GRAU
He might do it just to mollify Greta
How were you planning to film it

WAGNER
Well Im not sure anymore The script
calls for Ellen to lure the vampire to
her bedroom and then kill him with a
wooden stake But evidently they
dont die that way

GRAU
Indeed none of my research indicated
that vampires could be killed by

GRAU (contd)
sunlight Stokers is unaffected by
it

WAGNER
Still I suppose I might be able to
trick something up

GRAU
Yes
(idea)
-e-but why bother with tricks--as Herr
Doctor might say

They exchange looks WAGNER catches his drift Leans forward
conspiratorially

WAGNER
Wed have to keep him on the set until
after sunrise

GRAU
He doesnt get there until two With
normal delays Gretas moods and
everything else we could keep him
there for days Of course wed need
to know exactly when dawn is

WAGNER
Theres a synagogue They need to
know when the sun rises and sets for
their rites All we have to do is to
keep him from noticing the time

They look at each other smile in satisfaction

WAGNER
Should we tell Murnau

GRAU
No Its perfect as it is At dawn
Ill shout his name open the door

WAGNER
And bang I get it all on film

INT BUNKER -- NIGHT

BANG Close on a fire burning in one of the niches just as
GRAU shuts its iron grating rubs his hands in its warmth
Then we pull back and follow him to where he begins putting
the finishing touches on the set
In front of him adjusting the lights stands WAGNER Sitting
off to one side is GALEEN Standing at the door looking out
into the night is MURNAU

And--emerging from the shadows his presence causing the
firelight to flicker--we find SCHRECK

Enter GRETA in wig and make-up MURNAU shuts the door leads
her to the set takes her coat revealing a plain nightgown
as well as a pair of stylishly anachronistic high heels

GRETA
You know I dont like these late
shoots Herr Doctor Where is every-
body Why dont I have an assistant

GRAU
(going to her)
Did you put this make-up on with a
broom Greta

GRETA
Stop fussing Albin Can I have a
cigarette Wheres my script
Henrik Whats the matter with him
Why does everybody look so depressing
(shouts)
Hey who died

At that SCHRECK stalks over to her He carries a canvas
chair and offers it to her with exaggerated politeness

GRETA
Jesus look at you

She sits in the chair and looks sideways at him He stands
beside her and leers

GRETA
Herr Doctor Herr Doctor

MURNAU
(still holding her coat)
Yes What is it

GRETA
What is it Whats the shot Whats
going on here

He puts down the coat walks listlessly to her

MURNAU
All right Greta In this scene you
make the ultimate sacrifice for love
you seduce the vampire in order to
dispatch him just before you die
with a wooden stake

Orlocks shadow creeps up the staircase outside of Ellens

MURNAU
Really all you have to do is lie there
in fear and Max will do the rest

GRETA
You had me travel sixty kilometers
into the middle of the cold North Sea

She gets into bed SCHRECK takes his position between the bed
and the mirror mounted on the wall behind him He looks down
at her gently brushes her breast with his long nails

GRETA

Watch it asshole

MURNAU puts on his lab coat and goggles Walks over to where

Then he goes in search of morphine but before he can find it
MURNAU hands him a vial WAGNER looks at him

WAGNER
Great minds think alike

WAGNER prepares the shot injects her She relaxes falls
into a stupor MURNAU walks over to SCHRECK who storms at the
edge of the set

could use that to suggest the vampire
dissolved in the sunlight

MURNAU
Ill keep that in mind

SCHRECK
Thats enough Murnau Ill take her
now

WAGNER

(still filming)
Just a moment longer Dracula I need
a few seconds of the set without you

SCHRECK kicks over the chair rages like a junkie denied his
fix GRAU goes to GRETA repositions her on the bed fixes
her hair etc WAGNER films the bare wall for a few minutes

SCHRECK
I said thats enough

WAGNER

He does Begins filming again

MURNAU
Just a few more seconds Max

SCHRECK charges over to GRETA shoves GRAU roughly away

SCHRECK

He falls beside her licks his chops bites her in the neck
Theres a little popping noise she winces After a few
seconds his eyes grow heavy and he starts to nod off the
heroin is tranquilizing him as well as GRETA

GRAU GALEEN MURNAU AND WAGNER

watch with disgust MURNAU recovers indicates the camera
WAGNER begins filming
GALEEN
Later Hes sleeping in a chair a
distance from the set
GRAU AND MURNAU
stand off to one side smoking cigarettes consulting their
respective timepieces
WAGNER
leans on his camera smokes looks at his wristwatch 544
Then he looks at
SCHRECK AND GRETA
SCHRECK appears to be biting GRETA as before but when we look
closer we see that hes actually asleep
GRAU AND MURNAU
GRAU shows his watch to MURNAU walks over to WAGNER WAGNER
begins silently cranking the camera Then he looks over at
MURNAU And nods
SCHRECK AND GRETA -- AS BEFORE
MURNAU (0S)
(shouts)

Schreck

SCHRECK wakes He looks at MURNAU looks to his left His
eyes open angrily he climbs unsteadily to his feet

And thats when we look over to see whats enraged him

GALEEN

standing with his hand on the door release He looks at

MURNAU
who nods back at him

MURNAU
Now
GALEEN

pulls it the release opens the chain plays through for a few
feet Until suddenly theres no more chain

GALEEN
He cut it

SCHRECK
So you would break our bargain

He staggers toward MURNAU but hes still pretty shaky

SCHRECK (CONT)
You think you know so much Herr
Doctor But I can stillkill you

-and he stumbles grabs the wall for support

SCHRECK (CONT )
I can break your necks and drain your
bloodandI canyou tried to
trick me

He takes a deep breath regains his composure somewhat

SCHRECK (CONT )
Its daybreak is it So what Ill
stay here and then at duskonly I
will walk out alive

MURNAU
You forget that you dont have the
coffin in which you were interred

SCHRECK smiles Gets between MURNAU and the others spreads
his talons and bears down on him

SCHRECK
I was never interred I told you
before you know nothing of me Nor do
any of you All I need is to sleep in
darkness Coldly thy rosy shadows
bathe me cold are all thy lights

Suddenly WAGNER grabs the machine gun and shoots several
rounds into him The bullets poke a few dusty holes out of
him but dont seem to do much else

SCHRECK flies at MURNAU but MURNAU manages to slip away from
him He grabs the gun and shoots again This time the
bullets not only pierce SCHRECK but the door behind him
Light shoots in through the holes

SCHRECK sees it a scream catches in his throat And at the
sight of the sun something like ecstasy flickers across his
features Resigned in the moment he has left to live he
physically throws open the heavy steel door

His body diminishes in the overexposure And then he like
MICHELINE before him bubbles and vanishes

MURNAU stands watching the fluttering scraps of clothing that
remain He picks up a long pole fishes them up (along with
the remains of MICHELINEs cape which lies in a heap on the
ground) and shoves them into the fire

GALEEN slams the grating shut afterward The dirge begins
Then as we watch the fire the film itself seems to smolder
until it changes into the black and white stock of the
original Nosferatu The

MEN

stand beside GRETA She wakes a little evidently unharmed
Everyone laughs nervously On the old-fashioned film stock
their actions seem jerky and unreal Meanwhile the

CAMERA

has been shattered by a bullet and exposed film is coiling out
and piling up on the floor We watch this for a moment and
then we pull up until were watching from the

POV OF THE GALLERY

as WAGNER walks away from the others and begins extinguishing
the arc-lights One at a time Until he turns off the last
one and everything

All thats left is the music and the old silent movie film
stock over which we

ROLL CREDITS

END OF FILM
