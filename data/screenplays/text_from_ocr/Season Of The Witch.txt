EXT COAST OF FRANCE - NIGHT

Dark foreboding waves Rising and falling THUNDERING
against rocks

Out to sea we glimpse something The prow of a longboat
cutting through the waves struggling against a massive
swell then CRASHING down again with brutal force

EXT BOW OF BOAT - CONTINUOUS

TWO MEN man the oars

LAVEY DE CRECY a Knight of the Crusades bears the face of
a soldier chiseled and marked with scars

Behind him his loyal companion FELSON a mountain of a man
250 lbs from peak to base

EXT THE SHALLOWS - MOMENTS LATER

LaVey grabs the bowline and leaps out Felson close behind
Together they struggle through the surf stumbling and
dragging the boat behind them

They reach the shore and collapse in the sand Exhausted
Both men lie motionless Utterly spent

FADE TO BLACK
EXT BEACH - MORNING

The storm has passed and the seas are calm again Water laps
at LaVeys ankles He awakens squinting in the harsh sun

EXT SANDY DUNES - MORNING

LaVey appears over a rise to see Felson approaching He has
a walking stick in hand

FELSON
I saw a road back that way and a
sign for Marseille Less than a
days ride from here

LAVEY
And how long by foot

Felson grimaces at the thought
EXT COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

Boots tramp across a barren field

LaVey and Felson keep a brisk pace through the wintry
landscape

They emerge onto a muddy road Further down the path we see
some sheep and cattle chewing at weeds

LAVEY
Sheep roaming free And no
shepherd in sight

FELSON
Maybe they jumped the pen

LAVEY
Sheep and cattle alike

Felson shakes his head “no” Not likely
EXT ROAD - DAY

We find the two men trudging along a sodden countryside
The only sound the CRUNCH of their feet on the frozen earth

Felson slaps his hands together to warm them
FELSON
My belly feels empty We should
have slaughtered one of those
sheep

Something gets his attention

FELSON (CONTD)
Look there

LAVEY’S POV
Just beyond the tree line there’s a small farmhouse
FELSON (CONTD)
(his mood brightens)
Surely a warm meal for two Knights-
brethren is not too much to ask of

ones countrymen

LaVey points towards the stable where several gray horses
are penned

LAVEY
Two good horses would do

They make their way to the house
EXT FARMHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
LaVey KNOCKS at the door Its ajar He eases it open
INT FARMHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

LAVEY
Hello

LaVey steps inside

LAVEY’S POV

Low rafters in the ceiling A single wooden table No fire
in the hearth

LAVEY (CONTD)
Hello

No response

Felson moves over to the hearth where a cooking pot hangs
He touches it Cold He pulls the ladle from it smells the
contents Turns his nose from the foul smell

LAVEY (CONTD)
(louder )
Is anyone here

Still nothing LaVey moves to the door on the other side of
the room Partially open He peers inside Its very dim
The only window appears to have been covered over

INT BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

LaVey enters He can barely make out the shape of a bed in
the center of the room Felson follows him in

FELSON
I don’t like this LaVey

LaVey steps to the window Draws back the covering
Sunlight streams into the room He sees TWO FIGURES lying
under the covers of the bed their backs to him

LaVey moves around the foot of the bed where he sees the arm
of a man draped over a smaller form The arm is grotesque
covered with blackened boils and oozing sores

LaVey continues around to the side where the mans face
comes into view

Gray patches of mottled flesh and festering lesions seem to
have all but consumed it LaVey winces at the sight

FELSON (CONTD)
What in the name of God

Tucked under the mans arm is the equally disfigured and
rotting corpse of what must be his wife Blood has seeped
from her nostrils and ears onto her pillow

FELSON (CONTD)
What happened to them

LAVEY
I dont know A plague of some
kind

Felson turns away from the sight

FELSON
I thought the leper colonies of
San Lazzaro had shown us the
worst that could befall a man
but I was wrong

LaVeys eyes still on the corpse

LAVEY
Lets hope that death came quickly
and long before this

The womans eyes open

Her gangrenous arm reaches out from under the sheets towards
LaVey Startled he steps back Stands there Staring with
disbelief into the pleading eyes of the dying woman

He follows her outstretched arm to her trembling fingers
that reach for the hilt of his sword He looks back to
her She tries to speak but cant She doesnt have to

INTEXT STABLE - DAY

LaVey and Felson mount the two grays theyve saddled We
follow them out of the stable to find the farmhouse ablaze

Felson makes the sign of the cross in the air LaVey with
a final solemn glance turns his horse away
EXT ROAD TO MARSEILLE - AFTERNOON

A bitter wind blows LaVey and Felson plod on heads tucked
in against the cold They hear a noise growing in the
distance SOUNDS like THUNDER

--ba-BUMba-BUMba-BUM

Gradually out of the gloom A PROCESSION OF MEN appear At
the head The MASTER and his TWO LIEUTENANTS carry banners
of purple velvet and cloth of gold

Behind them barefoot men clad in rags march silently to
the macabre beat of a DRUMMER

--ba-BUMba-BUMba-BUM

Their heads and faces are hidden Their eyes focused on the
ground before them Each man carries a heavy leather thong
tipped with metal studs

When the Master starts praying the men begin beating them-
selves with the thongs

LaVey and Felson watch in bewilderment

LAVEY
(calling out to the
marchers)
What form of lunacy is this

The men don’t respond They simply pass silently around
them

VOICE (0S)
They cannot answer you friend

Both men jerk around in their saddles to see a DARK FIGURE
watching them from the other side of the road A Knight on
horseback

This is SANCIERRE A gaunt older Knight whose fingers rest
lightly on the pommel of his sword

SANCIERRE
They have taken a vow of silence

LAVEY
What in God’s name are they doing

The Knight

SANCIERRE
Penance They believe it is the
only way to regain God’s favor
through mortification of the flesh

FELSON
Theyre mad

SANCIERRE
Perhaps Who can say The Black
Death drives men to desperate
deeds

LAVEY
Its true then There is a plague

SANCIERRE

A plague like no other A
pestilence over all the land

(beat)
But how do you come through this
region untouched The plague is
known to have killed most between
here and Bourdeaux

FELSON
We came by sea from Constantinople

reacts with mild surprise

SANCIERRE
Ah Crusaders
(beat)
Then you have not heard the
Cardinals decree

LAVEY
Decree

SANCIERRE
All Knights of the land have been
called to Avignon

LAVEY
For what

SANCTERRE
That I do not know

LaVey and Felson share a look
EXT ROAD TO AVIGNON - AFTERNOON

The three Knights ride in silence along the banks of a river
Felson turns in his saddle to watch as several bloated forms
float by with the current Dead cattle a wagon and horse
and several unmistakably human shapes

SANCIERRE

The first to die were along the
coast They say the plague struck
so quickly that the stricken fell
dead within a night

(beat)
They were the fortunate ones
For the rest death came slowly
First the headaches then the
fever which renders those stricken
so weak they are forced to lie in
bed Within a day or two the
swellings appear They infect the
entire body Soon after the
internal bleeding and vomiting of
blood follows And in a matter of
days two maybe three the victim
succumbs

LAVEY
And there is no remedy

SANCIERRE
None

FELSON
How long has it been over the land

SANCIERRE
Two years and a season

Felson and LaVey react Staggered

LAVEY
How many dead

SANCIERRE
Some say so many as three in four

FELSON
Three in four

SANCIERRE

Believe it Entire towns have been
put to the torch

He gestures towards a passing road sign The name of a town
VASCON with a red X through it Felson and LaVey stare at
it as they pass

EXT WINDY HILLOCK - AFTERNOON

The riders reach the top of a ridge and stop to take in the
sight of

LE PALAIS DE PAPES The seat of the Catholic Church in
France it rises majestically from the hillside Massive
stone walls parapets turrets Commanding the high ground
for miles around

EXT PALACE GATE - MOMENTS LATER

With a SOUND of unseen GEARS and WHEELOCKS it begins to rise
INT COURTYARD - CONTINUOUS

The Knights pass through the gate into a cobbled courtyard

A PRIEST is already approaching through one of the vaulted
entries to greet them This is FRA’ DeBELZAQ advisor to the
Cardinal He is dressed in a simple brown robe bound at the
waist with the traditional rosaries of his order He studies
the Knights

DEBELZAQ
You are Knights of the order of
Saint John the Baptist

LaVey gives a terse nod

DeBelzaq sizes him up Then with a sudden flourish spins
and leads the way across the courtyard

DEBELZAQ (CONTD)
Follow me

INT THE GREAT HALL - PALACE - EVENING

DeBelzaq leads the Knights down the magnificent hall with its
rib vaulted ceiling A ghostly quiet has replaced the laughter
and excitement of the ceremonial banquets and jousting
tournaments once held here Only the ECHO of FOOTSTEPS breaks
the eerie silence

LAVEY

Tell me Fra DeBelzaq has Avignon
been spared the plague

DEBELZAQ
Spared Hardly Four hundred die
daily The sick are dying too fast
for the living to bury

FELSON
And the kings reaction to this
epidemic

DEBELZAQ
He asked the doctors at the
university for their help

LAVEY
And did they propose a remedy

DEBELZAQ
(embarrassed to admit)
Broth Seasoned with ground
pepper ginger and cloves Panic
spread soon after

Dubious looks between the Knights

FELSON
And the town authorities

DEBELZAQ
They banned all gambling and
swearing and demanded that
everyone living in sin get married

immediately

LAVEY
And

DEBELZAQ

The number of marriages increased
considerably and gambling declined
so much that dice makers turned to
making rosaries

(beat)
And in this newly virtuous place
twenty-five thousand citizens have
since died of the plague and are
buried in large pits on the
outskirts of town

DeBelzaq brings them to a halt in front of a tall gilded

doorway

DEBELZAQ (CONTD)
It was then that our king and the
local authorities turned to the
church for an answer

He open the doors and leads them into
INT CARDINAL’S CHAMBER -—- CONTINUOUS

At one end seated on a darkened dais surrounded by PHYSICIANS
is CARDINAL D’AMBROISE

DEBELZAQ
Gentlemen the Cardinal D’Ambroise
(by way of introduction)
Your eminence the Knights

The Cardinal leans forward squinting to see them As he
leans into the torchlight we see he is deathly pale almost
ghostlike

CARDINAL
(weakly)
How many have come
DEBELZAQ
Three your eminence
CARDINAL
(disappointed)
So few
LaVey steps forward
LAVEY

Your eminence Why is it that
weve been summoned

CARDINAL
Please Come no closer I am
stricken
(COUGHING)
The Black Death is in me

He glances sidelong at his physicians who are hovering just
out of arm’s reach

CARDINAL (CONTD)
Leave us

PHYSICIAN
But your eminence you grow
weaker
CARDINAL

No I die And your leeches and
ointments are of no use Now go

The physicians share a quick look pack up their jars and
beat a hasty exit

Once theyve left though it pains him to speak the Cardinal
turns to LaVey

CARDINAL (CONTD)
France is in the grip of a terrible
evil The King has fled his
kingdom and left his subjects to
die

He is interrupted by a sudden COUGHING FIT that wracks his
entire body He tries to stifle it with a handkerchief
When he draws his hand away we glimpse the white silk
flecked red with blood

CARDINAL (CONTD)
(recovering a bit)
Judicum Universale

LAVEY
Last Judgement

He looks up as if to gauge the Knights reactions LaVey
is the only one who takes it all in stoic silence

The Cardinal looks to him curiously

CARDINAL
Do you not believe this to be true

LAVEY
I believe that we live in dark
times

CARDINAL

A guarded response

LAVEY
I’m a Knight not a priest

CARDINAL
And as a Knight as a soldier of
God you hold no belief

LAVEY
What would you have me believe

CARDINAL
(straining to continue)
The plague is a curse called up
from Hell Brought upon us by the
Black Witch

LAVEY
The Black Witch

DeBelzaq intercedes for the flagging Cardinal

DEBELZAQ
Several weeks ago a girl was found
wandering in the forest on the
outskirts of the city She said
shed come from the village of
Louresse

CARDINAL
That place is gone now Wiped out
by the plague

DEBELZAQ
From there she traveled west to
Marseille From there here to
Avignon And everywhere she went
it was the same

CARDINAL
In her footsteps followed death

LAVEY
I dont understand wh

DEBELZAQ
(hastening to add)
There is a holy place where our
Benedictine brothers possess an
ancient book A book of rituals
that will destroy the witchs
powers

CARDINAL
The Abbey Severac

SANCIERRE
Severac Thats many leagues from
here in the gray mountains
(aside to LaVey)
A desolate place

CARDINAL
Only there can her curse be lifted

LAVEY
Why are you telling us this

CARDINAL
Because you must deliver her there

LaVeys eyes darken but he says nothing
INT DUNGEON STAIRS - NIGHT

The Knights descend a flight of dank stone steps that wind
in circles downward DeBelzaq leads the way with a torch

DEBELZAQ

Be careful the witch may attempt
to question you Do not answer
She will mingle truth with lies
She will try to turn one man
against the other

(he pauses glances back)
Also dont get too close She
almost killed one of our jailors

At the bottom he unbolts a heavy steel door

INT DUNGEON - CONTINUOUS

A BURLY JAILOR rises as DeBelzaq and the Knights enter
LaVey looks around and sees that they are circled on all
sides by thick cell doors But one of the doors stands out

It has been reinforced with steel bars and braced by a thick
oaken beam

DeBelzaq moves towards it

DEBELZAQ
(to the Jailor)
Open it

The jailor moves forward with a ring of keys unlocks the

door and pushes the beam away with both hands He pulls the
door open It swings wide like the vault of some dark tomb

LaVey takes a torch from the wall
INT DUNGEON CELL - CONTINUOUS

He enters the darkened interior The others follow lLaVey
raises his torch for a better view and WHIRLS suddenly as he
hears a noise There’s a SHADOWY FIGURE on the ground in
the corner

LaVey takes a step forward The flickering light of his
torch illuminates the cowering form of a PEASANT GIRL
She turns away

FELSON
(surprised)
Shes just a girl

LAVEY
What is your name

She doesnt answer LaVey steps closer

LAVEY (CONTD)
Your name girl Cant you speak

Still nothing LaVey steps around to see her face

She draws her legs in tight We hear the chain around her
ankle rattle

LAVEY (CONTD)
Youve been accused of witchcraft
Do you understand what that means

DEBELZAQ
Youre wasting your time She
has already confessed to this
LaVey moves his torch about the cell
LAVEY
I see no plate of food No water
Is she not fed

DeBelzaqs silence is answer enough lLaVey turns back to the
Girl

LAVEY (CONTD)
Are you hungry

The Girl suddenly lunges at LaVey wild-eyed her fingers
clawing for his neck But the chain around her ankle jerks
taut at the last instant stopping her just inches from him

GIRL
Come closer I11l show you how
hungry I am You sonofabitch

The Girl struggles in vain to reach him The chains snapping
and jerking

LaVey holds his ground
INT DUNGEON - MOMENTS LATER
The men exit and make their way out of the dank surroundings
DEBELZAQ
(to LaVey)
Satisfied
LAVEY
(to DeBelzaq)
That she is half-starved and
delirious Yes
INT GUEST HALL - LATER

A blazing fire Embers smoke and glow

FELSON (0S)
You mean you dont believe it

Felson paces back and forth LaVey stands before the fire
staring at the flames A goblet of wine in his hand

LAVEY
That she is a witch Certainly
not

FELSON

But she confessed

LAVEY
Oh that I do not doubt The
church can be
(choosing his words
carefully)
Very persuasive

Felson considers this falls silent

SANCIERRE
Then you would refuse the
Cardinals request

LaVey nods

FELSON
Is this wise of you

SANCIERRE
I have my doubts as well but
one does not lightly disobey
the church LaVey

LaVey slams his goblet down The red wine flies out of it
spilling onto his hand

LAVEY
I will not have the blood of
an innocent girl on my hands
No matter how mad she is

LaVey wipes the wine from his hand Stops as he sees
DeBelzaq standing in the entrance An awkward moment

DEBELZAQ
You believe she is innocent
But you are deceived She is
the very embodiment of evil

LAVEY

(low tense)
Ive seen evil priest Do not
presume I am so easily deceived

He pushes past leaving the others to stare after him mutely
CUT TO
A SERIES OF HAUNTING IMAGES
The steel-clad forms of CRUSADER KNIGHTS on horseback gallop
out of the shadows like horrific metallic demons They wield
their swords high
TURK PEASANTS MEN WOMEN and CHILDREN fleeing to and fro
COMMANDER DRAGONET (VO)
They are a godless people Infidels
Who have killed our brethren

They must not go unpunished We
(MORE)

COMMANDER DRAGONET (VO) (CONTD)
must wipe them out All of them
Spare no one

KNIGHTS POV

We single out A GIRL on the run She wheels around in terror
Freezes as we make eye contact Her face streaked with tears

We ride towards her She screams a soundless cry and flees
We wield our sword left and right hacking down anything in
our path Were gaining on the Girl our sword rising coming
down slashing her across the back She goes stumbling
falling to the ground

Blood seeps through the clothing on her back as she struggles
to get to her feet But before she can our shadow falls
over her She looks up with wide terrified eyes For an
odd moment we regard one another her eyes imploring ours
Mercilessly we raise our sword The Girl SCREAMS

INT PALACE BEDROOM - NIGHT

LaVey jerks awake His forehead is glistening with sweat It
takes his shattered senses a moment to register where he is

He climbs out of bed pulls on his tunic
EXT PALACE CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

LaVey walks down the hall Its ghostly quiet at this hour
just the SOUND of his FEET on the marble floor

INT STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS

LaVey descends with a torch

Half way down the steps he falters at a SOUND from below
A pitiable WEEPING that ECHOES up the staircase

INT DUNGEON - CONTINUOUS

LaVey enters

He looks around and sees the Jailor asleep cotton plugs
jammed into his ears He follows the WEEPING to the peasant
girl’s cell and opens a small observation window to peer
through

LAVEY’S POV

Moonlight filters through the cells only window illuminating
the Girl huddled on the floor CRYING

Shes been stripped to her waist her back bloodied from

fresh wounds that shes suffered
Lavey wants to speak out say something when

Suddenly theres a scurrying motion on the floor

A rat

races across the stones The girl lunges out and snatches it
up Theres a sickening SNAP as she breaks it in her hands
Ravenous she hunches over and slowly begins to eat it

Torn between pity and disgust LaVey closes the window

FADE TO BLACK

INT DINING HALL - DAWN

LaVey enters to find Felson Sancierre and DeBelzaq already

seated around the breakfast table

LAVEY
You can tell the Cardinal I have
made my decision

DeBelzaq and the others glance up from their food

LAVEY (CONTD)
I will take the girl to Severac
on one condition that she be
given a fair trial I want to
see the evidence with my own eyes

DEBELZAQ
But as Ive told you she has
already confessed

LaVey remains stone-faced

DEBELZAQ (CONTD)
(frustrated)
I must discuss this with the
Cardinal He will not be pleased

LAVEY
Perhaps not But the offer is
final

DEBELZAQ
Very well

DeBelzaq leaves the table

LAVEY
DeBelzaq

The priest looks back to LaVey

LAVEY (CONTD)
Tell his eminence that we will
need fresh horses And for my
companions full blessings and
remissions from sin

DEBELZAQ
And as for yourself

LAVEY
I require nothing from the church

An awkward moment DeBelzaq exits
EXT PALACE - DAY

Rain PATTERS against a stained glass window of the palace
From within a warm glow is visible

INT CARDINALS BED CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS

The Cardinal is huddled in his bed his forehead feverish
with sweat DeBelzaq kneels by the bedside having just
conveyed LaVeys terms

CARDINAL
Under the circumstances we have
little choice but to agree

DEBELZAQ
Very well Then with your
approval I shall prepare the
documents that the Abbot will
require

CARDINAL
Gods will be done

DeBelzaq looks up with an expression of uncertainty Clearly
something more he wants to say

CARDINAL (CONTD)
Speak your mind DeBelzaq

DEBELZAQ
Its LaVey your eminence

CARDINAL
What about him

DEBELZAQ
(with difficulty)
I fear that he has lost his
faith if ever he possessed it

CARDINAL
(after some consideration)
All the more reason why its
essential that you accompany them
on their journey

DEBELZAQ
Me But but I am no Knight
Of what use would I be

CARDINAL
LaVey is the sword You are
the cross Where he is weak
you must be strong And when
he loses his way
(beat)
--you must stay the course

DeBelzaq stares for a moment a little stunned Then with
quiet dignity and though he is not pleased by the prospect
his head drops in a gesture of acquiescence

DEBELZAQ
As you will

INT MAPROOM - AFTERNOON

A map being unfurled across a table A finger points to a
spot on the chart

DEBELZAQ
We are here
(indicating another spot)
The abbey is here

DeBelzaq stands over a long mahogany table across which
several charts have been spread

DEBELZAQ (CONTD)
The distance is nearly four hundred
leagues Roughly six days travel
As you can see Ive charted a
course that should

LAVEY

(indicating)
You would lead us through here

DEBELZAQ
Its the shortest way The most
direct route

LAVEY
Tell me priest have you ever made
the journey

DEBELZAQ
No But these charts are the most
accurate in the land

LAVEY
Yes I can see that And
accurately enough this area
here

(indicating)
-has been identified as Wormwood
Forest And it is not a place to
be trifled with Men have lost
their way in it never to be seen
again

SANCIERRE
LaVey is right Maps are fine but
it would be wise to have a guide
Someone who knows the region

They turn to DeBelzaq for some suggestion The priest looks
up slowly

DEBELZAQ
(reluctantly)
There is one Though I cannot
sing his praises

EXT CASTLE COURTYARD - AFTERNOON

LaVey Felson and Sancierre approach the stocks where we see
a man locked up

This is HAGAMAN His head and hands protrude through holes
in the pillory so that he can’t lift up or look around All
he can do is stare at the ground

HAGAMAN
(he hears their footsteps)
Ah visitors What can I do for
you gentlemen Perhaps you’d like
to pelt me with fruit Or kick me
in the groin

HAGAMAN’S POV
LaVey kneels into view

LAVEY
You are Hagaman The swindler

HAGAMAN

No I mean yes I am Hagaman
But I never swindled anyone I
sold relics Genuine relics

LAVEY
Where did you sell your trinkets

HAGAMAN
Everywhere I have happy customers
from here to Prague

LAVEY
And Severac

Hagaman thinks for a second

HAGAMAN
Yes the monks I sold them the
tail of an ass ridden in the flight
from Egypt

LAVEY
So it’s safe to assume you know
the way to the abbey

HAGAMAN
Like the back of my hand Id be
happy to draw you a map but as
you can see

He wiggles his hands in the stocks
LaVey throws his hand over Hagamans mouth

LAVEY
Shut up and listen to me The
magistrate is prepared to offer you
an early release on one condition
that you serve as a guide to myself
and four others who have matters of
importance in Severac

LaVey removes his hand

HAGAMAN
Condition accepted Now if you
would be so kind as to unlock

LAVEY
But if I were to release you
(resting his hand on his
sword)
--and you attempt to flee

HAGAMAN
Sir Release me from this
embarrassment and I will guide
you anywhere you so desire

LaVey studies him Unconvinced he stands up

Hagaman strains his neck to see LaVey

HAGAMAN (CONTD)
(pleading)
I swear by all the saints May
they strike me dead if I tell a
lie

LAVEY
If you do

LaVey draws his sword lifts it to strike

HAGAMAN
Wh-what are you doing No
Please

LAVEY
Theyll have to get in line behind
me

A desperate

WHAM LaVey brings the sword down on top of the block

slicing the lock in half Hagaman SCREAMS

LaVey swings open the block Hagaman opens his eyes
Stands clutches his throat surprised it’s still there

LAVEY (CONTD)
Do we understand one another

Hagaman nods timidly

LAVEY (CONTD)
Good

EXT PALACE - DAWN
The first rays of the sun creep over the ramparts
INT CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS
LaVey Felson and Sancierre emerge from their chambers led
by DeBelzagq They are each carrying a long staff with a
noose of thick leather at the end
DEBELZAQ
The witch is drugged She was
given a powerful remedy in her
food last night
LAVEY
(re staff)
Then what are these for

DEBELZAQ
A precaution Thats all

INT DUNGEON - MOMENTS LATER

The jailor rises as the men enter DeBelzaq gestures towards
the Girls cell door

The jailor unlocks it and swings the heavy door open
LaVey Felson and Sancierre share a look and silently enter
the cell The jailor seals the door shut behind them

INT DUNGEON CELL - CONTINUOUS

There sprawled on the floor unconscious is the Girl

LaVey Felson and Sancierre take up positions around her

DeBelzaq crosses to the far wall where the shackle chain is
fastened to a heavy steel ring in the stone

The three Knights quietly maneuver their staffs and slip the
nooses over her head Once all three are in place LaVey
gives a nod to DeBelzaq

The priest takes one of the keys that hang from around his
neck and sticks it into the lock

An anxious Sancierre takes a step back His foot CLINKS

against something on the floor He and the others look to
see the Girls plate of food sitting there untouched

SANCIERRE
(turning to DeBelzaq)
Wait

Too late DeBelzagq turns the key unlocking the chain It
slips out of the ring

And suddenly the girl comes alive

GIRL
(to DeBelzaq)
Murderous priest Why have you
poisoned my food

The Girl hurls herself at the priest DeBelzaq scrambles
back trying to get away from her

LaVey yanks on his staff The Girl flails at it CRACK
It splinters apart and whips free

The Girl scuttles after DeBelzagq

Felson and Sancierre who hold the remaining two poles are
jerked after her DeBelzaq finds himself cornered In a mad
rage the Girl lunges at the priest

LaVey manages to snatch up the remaining half of his staff
and wrench her back just in time She turns on LaVey grabs
hold of his staff

LaVey surprised by her strength and too close by half is
about to be pounced upon when

Felson charges at her Ramming the end of his staff into
her throat Driving her back against the wall

LaVey and Sancierre seize the moment to cinch their nooses
tight around the Girls neck and force her to the ground
She continues to struggle as DeBelzaq steps over to her

DEBELZAQ
Struggle if you like but it
has been decided that you are
to be taken to Severac and

Threateningly he reveals the other half of LaVeys staff
clutched in his fist

DEBELZAQ (CONTD)

one way or another to Severac
you will go

The Girl ceases struggling and slumps back against the cell
wall with a sigh of defeat

FADE TO BLACK
EXT COURTYARD - DAY

Hagaman and Felson wait on horseback as the heavy stable
doors before them swing open

LaVey leads the way for a horse drawn wagon Sancierre is
at the reigns DeBelzaq is seated next to him The rear of
the wagon has A cage atop it A portable prison cell built
of re-enforced lead bars
HAGAMAN
(to Felson)
Something someone forgot to tell
me

Hagaman peers at the cage as it passes sees the imprisoned
Girl within shackled to the floor

Hagaman calls out to LaVey

HAGAMAN (CONTD)
Who is she

LAVEY
Shes the reason we go to Severac

Hagaman looks to Felson confused

FELSON
Shes a witch Or so they say

Felson rides off to join LaVey
HAGAMAN
A what No one said anything about
witches
Hagaman takes off to catch up to the others
THE PALACE GATE
RUMBLES open The wagon rolls out

HIGH ABOVE - A PALACE WINDOW

The Cardinal watches solemnly as they diminish in the
distance

CARDINAL
(makes the sign of the
cross)
Christophori sancti speciem

EXT COUNTRY ROAD - LATER
The wagon rattles down a narrow dirt lane

Hagaman is riding alongside the wagon He glances toward the
cage

HAGAMANS POV

The Girl is peering at him Her head lolling with the motion
of the wagon

Disturbed Hagaman turns away Rides up alongside DeBelzag

HAGAMAN
Shes staring at me

DEBELZAQ
Pay no attention to her

SANCIERRE
Look elsewhere

Hagaman looks to his left theres a rotten gnarled tree
He looks to his right a cemetery filled with headstones

HAGAMAN
Lovely

Felson and LaVey are riding along at the rear of the wagon

The Girl sits on the floor in the center of the cage her
back to them

FELSON
(eye on the Girl)
I felt her strength And I must
confess it did not feel like the
strength of a girl

LAVEY
Shes mad Felson And madness
lends strength That is all

Felson considers this Doesnt seem convinced

FELSON
What if you are wrong

LAVEY
(musing)
If she is truly a servant of the
Devil

The Girl turns an ear to their conversation
LAVEY (CONTD)
then I should think her powers
are beyond all of us and we neednt
give it another thought

Not exactly what Felson wanted to hear He happens to look
back over his shoulder and notices something

FELSON
Were being followed

LaVey doesnt react

LAVEY
How many

SANCIERRE
One Behind us on the ridge

LaVey casts a disinterested glance over his shoulder

LAVEYS POV

A lone RIDER on horseback

EXT TREE-LINED ROAD - AFTERNOON

The Rider rounds the next bend and stops in surprise
RIDERS POV

The wagon is sitting still in the road The Knights who were
escorting it are nowhere in sight

The Rider looks perplexed Suddenly theres a sharp WHISTLE
from behind him He turns back to see

LaVey Felson and Sancierre emerging from the trees Felson
has him in his crossbow sights

Lavey rides up to the Rider

LAVEY
And who have we here

The hooded Rider offers no response lLaVey inches his horse
closer reaches up and yanks back the cowl Its a boy
barely eighteen

LAVEY (CONTD)
I asked you a question boy

KAYLAN
My my name is Kaylan

LAVEY
Why are you following us

KAYLAN
I want to join you on your journey
to Severac

LAVEY
How do you know of our destination

KAYLAN

I was an altar boy in the service
of the Cardinal It was whispered
that Knights were coming to take
the witch to Severac I came to
offer you my services

FELSON
And what services pray tell
might those be

KAYLAN
Those of a Knight

Felson lets out a harsh BARK of LAUGHTER

KAYLAN (CONTD)
In exchange for which I ask your
word as gentlemen and Knights that
you vouch for me upon our return
so that I may be Knighted

LaVey looks to Felson in whimsical disbelief then back to
the boy

LAVEY
An altar boy did you say

Felson squelches another outburst

KAYLAN
Yes but Ill have you know Ive
ridden twice in the lists and won
flags for valor

FELSON
This is no tournament boy Go
home to your mother

He motions Kaylan away

KAYLAN
The road is free old man You
cannot stop me from traveling it

Ouch LaVey winces knowing the boy has just pushed Felsons

button

LAVEY
If I were you boy Id offer my
apology to this gentleman and do
as he says

KAYLAN
Ill do neither

Incensed Felson turns to LaVey

FELSON
Do you mind

LaVey motions be my guest

Felson dismounts Draws his sword Beckons to Kaylan

FELSON (CONTD)
Get down from there boy You want
to be a Knight allow me the honor
of teaching you your first lesson

He WHIPS his sword in a quick WHISTLING arc Kaylan nods
climbs down drawing his sword

LAVEY (0S)
Felson

Felson looks back

LAVEY (CONTD)
The other hand And dont kill
him Just send him on his way

Felson nods switches the sword to his left hand He and
Kaylan begin circling each other warily hefting their blades
warming up And then KLANG Felson delivers a blow

Surprisingly Kaylan deflects it
And theyre circling again

KLANG Another blow from Felson also deflected And this
time Ker-KLANG Kaylan comes right back with one of his own

Felson parries But the blow was quick and well-placed and
it earns notice

SANCIERRE
Not bad for an altar boy

The others LAUGH

Felson no longer toying moves rapidly KLANG KLONG
Kaylan dodges the third blow stepping around a tree
Felsons sword WHISTLES through the air sending him off
balance He staggers a bit

FELSON
What the hell was that Stand and
fight like a man you jackrabbit

Felson circles the tree and the fight continues A series of
rapid blows which are deflected and parried with increasing
speed back and forth

Until Felson begins to truly lose his temper He is about to
switch the sword to his right hand when

LAVEY
Thats enough

Both men stop and look to LaVey who oddly is smiling
LAVEY (CONTD)
(to Kaylan)
Perhaps you can be of service
after all

Pleased with himself Kaylan grins

EXT WOODED AREA - NIGHT

Kaylan has been relegated to gathering firewood The would-
be-Knight keeps his complaints to himself

Nearby the wagon has been unhitched and set in the shelter
of a large elm tree directly opposite the open doors of

INT ABANDONED BARN —- CONTINUOUS

The men are gathered around a small fire eating a meal
They are in mid-debate

SANCIERRE
I tell you the plague travels
by touch Not through the air

HAGAMAN
I tell you it can TI have seen
Knights stricken even in full
armor

DEBELZAQ
And what cure have you for that
A relic Some worthless bauble

HAGAMAN
I have both relics and indulgences
The rarest between here and Rome
Some of them offer protection from
the plague

He reaches for his satchel a heavy burlap bag and rummages
inside

HAGAMAN (CONTD)
For a paltry price I might be
willing to part with this stone
the very same one that slew
Goliath

Sancierre rolls his eyes Felson SNORTS with scepticism

FELSON
Selling false relics is a sin
Have you no shame

LAVEY
Ah Now listen closely gentlemen
For this is a subject in which my
friend is well versed

LAUGHTER

LAVEY (CONTD)
In fact if it weren’t for his
sins the two of us might never
have met
(to Felson)
Shall I tell the story

FELSON
I doubt they’d find it amusing

SANCIERRE
Allow us to be the judge of that

Felson rolls his eyes in dismay Sancierre and the
encourage LaVey to continue

LAUGHTER

Felson is

LAVEY

(to the others)
Soon after becoming a Knight as
is customary with the newest
members I was enlisted to
accompany a priest whose job it
was to recruit future prospects
from the neighboring villages

(beat)
One afternoon the priest was
explaining to the young men of
the village that whoever went on
crusade would receive blessings
from the church and full remission
from their sins It was the part
about sin that perked young
Felson’s interest

FELSON
Not true

LAVEY
(ignoring him)
So much so in fact that he asks
of the priest precisely which sins
would be forgiven Would they for
instance forgive adultery

gradually turning red with humiliation

others

LAVEY (CONTD)

The priest thinks about it for a
moment and says Yes For a
two year pledge

(beat)
What about theft Felson asks
The priest gives it some thought
and again says Yes But for
no less than a three year pledge

(beat)
So Felson thinks it over and
finally says to the priest

(imitating Felson)
Well if it’s alright with you
father why don’t you sign me up
for ten to start

The men burst into LAUGHTER at Felson’s expense Slapping
him heartily on the back

EXT ABANDONED BARN - MOMENTS LATER
LaVey exits with a plate of food in hand

THE WAGON

LaVey finds the Girl awake and seated on the floor in the
center of the cage

LAVEY
I brought you some food

LaVey slides the plate through an opening between the
crossbar and the floor Pushes it towards her

GIRL
Why do you bother

LAVEY
One has to eat

The Girl crawls the short distance to retrieve it As she
does we see that her ankle is shackled to a short length of
chain secured to the floor that prevents her reaching the
sides of the cage She pulls the plate to her Smells it

LAVEY (CONTD)
It’s soup And bread Nothing
more

She tastes it Eats

GIRL
This place youre taking me
what will happen to me there

LAVEY
Your innocence or guilt will be
decided
She stops eating
GIRL

There was a girl in my village who

was suspected of being a witch
(beat)

They put stones in her pockets and

cast her into the lake If she had

drowned they would have known

she was human But she didnt

She lived They called it proof of

magic and burned her at the stake

LAVEY

Nothing of the kind will happen to

you You will be judged fairly I

give you my word

CUT TO

PHOOSH The flames of the campfire are stoked
Kaylan adds some wood to the fire
INT ABANDONED BARN - CONTINUOUS
Felson Sancierre and Hagaman are having a laugh and passing
the wineskin amongst themselves Sancierre regards Kaylan
Passes the wineskin to him

Kaylan takes it uncertainly

SANCIERRE
Go on boy It won’t kill you

Kaylan takes a long pull and GASPS when he’s done

LAUGHTER amongst the others Kaylan sits down and joins them

LaVey returns

KAYLAN
(gaining courage)
Tell me about the crusades I
want to know all about

LAVEY
(interrupting)
Another time boy Its late
and weve an early start

The men rise

DEBELZAQ
(to LaVey)
I suggest that I and another take
the first watch of the witch

LAVEY
Two men to watch one girl whos
shackled and locked in a cage
Nonsense Sancierre you have the
first watch When you tire wake
DeBelzaq here to relieve you

Sancierre nods picks up his scabbard and makes his way to
the wagon

DEBELZAQ
Be watchful Sancierre

SANCIERRE
Always

EXT CAMPSITE - LATER

Sancierre is seated by the wagon Hes awake watching the
Girl

HIS POV

Shes asleep In the pale moonlight her features appear
softer

A TAP on Sancierres shoulder catches him off guard Its
DeBelzaq

DEBELZAQ
Im sorry Forgive me I came
to relieve you I thought youd
fallen asleep

SANCIERRE
No Just daydreaming

DeBelzaq takes a seat next to Sancierre

DEBELZAQ
(making light)
Daydreaming in the middle of the
night no less

SANCIERRE
I was thinking about how much the
girl reminds me of my own daughter

DEBELZAQ
You have a daughter

SANCIERRE
I did
(beat)
She died Seven years ago She
would have been her age

An awkward silence

DEBELZAQ
Im sorry

Sancierre shrugs to mask the pain His eyes still on the
Girl

SANCIERRE

Shes someones daughter as well

(beat)
Tell me Father You say the
Cardinal has given his word that
shell get a fair trial but has
he not also given his word to end
this plague

DeBelzaqs expression hardens

DEBELZAQ
What are you suggesting

SANCIERRE
Can you imagine the reaction of
the people if she were not to
be found guilty of witchcraft
(beat)
Then what What would they do
What god might they turn to
(MORE)

SANCIERRE (CONTD)
(beat)
No father You know as well as
I that the church cannot afford
to fail its people Not now

Sancierre rises

SANCIERRE (CONTD)
I will not be a party to this
Nor will the others hopefully
when theyve heard what I have
to say

GIRL (0S)
Wait

Sancierre and DeBelzaq turn to see
THE CAGE

The frightened face and pleading eyes of an innocent young
girl looking at him Tears streaming down her cheeks

GIRL (CONTD)
Is it true what you say That I
am damned

Sancierre looks away he cannot face her with the truth

GIRL (CONTD)
(growing more upset)
If you let this happen you will
have my innocent blood on your
hands for the rest of your life
Does that mean nothing to you

She collapses to the floor SOBBING
Sancierre steps towards the cage
DEBELZAQ
Sancierre Dont listen to her
She plays upon your sympathies
Ignoring the priest Sancierre steps up to the bars
SANCIERRE
Listen to me I will not let

them

The Girl lunges at Sancierre There is no shackle on her
ankle to stop her from reaching him

She reaches through the bars grabs him with both hands and
yanks him violently against the cage Slamming his head into
the bars

DeBelzaq rushes to help Sancierre Tries to pull him loose
from the Girls grip

The Girl seizes the moment to rip the chain (that holds a cross
and the key to the cage door) from around the priests neck
She plunges the crucifix through the back of DeBelzaqs hand
pinning it to the floor of the wagon

The priest lets loose a CRY of AGONY

EXT CAMPFIRE - CONTINUOUS

LaVey and the others are awakened by it

EXT WAGON - MOMENTS LATER

LaVey Felson Kaylan and Hagaman come rushing to the wagon
to find Sancierre sprawled in the dirt DeBelzaq still
pinned to the wagon SCREAMING in pain The cage open And
the Girl gone

Hagaman helps the shaken Sancierre to his feet

LaVey pulls the cross out of DeBelzaqs hand He collapses
to the ground clutching the hand

LAVEY
What happened How did she
escape

DEBELZAQ
She took the key from around my
neck

LaVey shoots a look to the cage door the key still inserted
in the lock

KAYLAN (0S)
LaVey

Lavey looks to Kaylan inside the cage The unlocked shackle
in his hand

KAYLAN (CONTD)
She picked the lock

LAVEY

(to DeBelzaq)
Which way did she go

The priest is in too much pain to recall He shakes his head
uncertainly

FELSON (0S)
This way

LaVey sees Felson kneeling by a trampled patch of grass at
the edge of the glade

LAVEY

Kaylan Saddle the horses

Hagaman Tend to the priests

hand then follow with the wagon

EXT COUNTRYSIDE - NIGHT
On horseback torches in hand LaVey Felson Sancierre and
Kaylan make their way through a wooded area in search of the
Girl
A WINDY RIDGE - MOMENTS LATER

The Knights arrive on a hillock overlooking the VILLAGE OF
GIVAUDON LaVey reins to a stop Peers into the dark

LAVEY (CONTD)
Where is she We should have
passed her by now
A CRACK of LIGHTNING brightens the sky Felson sees something
FELSON
(pointing)

There

The men look A second BOLT of LIGHTNING reveals the Girl
ducking into one of the alleyways of the hamlet

The men race after her
EXT ALLEYWAY - MOMENTS LATER

The Knights arrive amid a clatter of hooves They spill into
the narrow cobbled lane

LaVey leads the pack as they gallop between the small stone
houses

LAVEYS POV

Up ahead a CLOAKED FIGURE on the run A BURST of LIGHTNING
Its the Girl Her cloak flapping behind her as she vanishes
into an alley to the right LaVey motions for Felson and
Sancierre to follow her while he races for the mouth of the
alley with Kaylan close behind

LaVey and Kaylan cross another alleyway LaVey shoots a look
to his right sees someone moving across it one lane over
He signals Kaylan to take the right

Felson catches a fleeting glimpse of someone on the move
just ahead He gestures for Sancierre to circle around to
the left

All four men are closing in
EXT VILLAGE CENTER - CONTINUOUS

The men spill out of the alleyways converging on the village
center

LAVEY
(pointing)
There

They see the Girl attempting to enter one of the houses
In a blur Kaylan and Sancierre are out of their saddles and
chasing after her LaVey close behind

She tries to run but Felson appears on horseback to block
her escape

Kaylan and Sancierre grab hold of her As they turn her
around to face LaVey the flame of his torch illuminates the
plague ravaged face of an OLD WOMAN The sight of her stops
LaVey in his tracks Sancierre and Kaylan recoil

A sudden CLATTER sends LaVey whirling around to see a death
cart making its way slowly through the square

The CART WORKERS masked men who collect the bodies of the
dead are piling them into the back of the cart when their
team of horses rear back

LaVey sees the Girl streak past the horses and disappear into
the alley beside them lLaVey and his men continue the
pursuit on foot

EXT MOUTH OF THE ALLEY - MOMENTS LATER

LaVey and his men funnel out of a narrow pathway The dark
and shadowy terrain of A VALLEY extends before them

A BURST of LIGHTNING illuminates mounds of displaced earth
and trenches dug in the hard cold ground

WHOOOMP From one of the distant trenches flames erupt high
into the night sky

Before any of the men can even voice their reaction a shape
is seen silhouetted by the flames Its the Girl She
descends into one of the trenches

LAVEY
Quickly After her

EXTINT TRENCH - MOMENTS LATER

The men scramble down the makeshift steps into the trench
It runs both directions

LAVEY
(to Sancierre)
You and Kaylan go that way

Torch in hand Sancierre leads the way LaVey and Felson
take off in the other direction

Kaylan and Sancierre slog through the muck The walls of

the trench waver this way and that preventing a view of any
distance

As they continue the trench begins to slope downhill

Soon theyre sloshing through an 18 inch deep pool of slimey
liquod The footing becoming more and more precarious

Kaylan trips over something and goes down

Sancierre turns back lowers his torch to find Kaylan on
all fours

SANCIERRE
You alright boy

KAYLAN
Yes And Id be even better
if youd stop calling me boy

Sancierre reaches down to give hima hand Kaylan lifts his
hand from the murky liquid it comes out black

KAYLAN (CONTD)
What in the

He smells his hand

KAYLAN (CONTD)
(surprised)
Smells like oil

SANCIERRE
What

Kaylan looks down at the muck he finds himself in and there
just beneath the surface he sees FACES OF THE DEAD He gasps
stumbles back and up onto his feet eyes wide with fear

SANCIERRE (CONTD)
What is it

KAYLAN
(fighting a wave of panic)
The dead The dead are beneath us
(his eyes dart back down
to what lies underfoot)

Everywhere
SANCIERRE
What
KAYLAN

This is a grave Its a mass grave
we stand upon

Sancierre lowers his torch to see for himself then stops

SANCIERRE
Did you say oil

Kaylan manages a nod Sancierre raises the torch up away
from the highly combustible fluid

He hears something Shoots a look into the darkness ahead
Listens Turns back to Kaylan

SANCIERRE (CONTD)
Stay here

Sancierre turns and rushes off through the knee-deep muck
His torchlight disappearing with him into the darkness

Sancierre comes to a split veers left follows it a
distance stops Listens Nothing

Behind him A FORM darts past barely glimpsed

Sancierre hears the PATTER of feet SPLASHING through the
water He whirls around

CUT TO

Lavey and Felson hear something A RUSTLING SOUND coming
from somewhere ahead They inch forward quietly The sound
continues Closer Until its coming from just around the
bend LaVey motions for Felson to stop A hand signal and
they swing around the corner

To come face to face with a PLAGUE DOG Its face a bleeding
oozing mess It snaps and growls at the intruders Foam
frothing over its teeth Its feeding on something it
doesnt want to share Could be the Girl

LaVey rushes at the animal torch first Puts the flame
to it The rabid dog lets out with a WAIL and races off

LaVey sheds some light on the dogs victim to find that
its a diseased corpse One of dozens that make up the
mound the two men stand upon

CUT TO

LIGHTNING FLASHES Reveal the plague dog careening through
the trenches

CUT TO

LIGHTNING FLASHES Reveal Kaylan alone in the dark still
frozen in his tracks He hears something

KAYLAN
Sancierre

Nothing He draws his sword His eyes darting amidst the
shadows

KAYLAN (CONTD)
Sancierre Is that you

He hears movement behind him Spins around
CUT TO
Sancierre bursts around the bend to find nothing Just

more trench Suddenly theres a PEAL of CHILDLIKE LAUGHTER
He whirls back

SANCIERRE
Anna

VOICE (0S)
Papa

Sancierre freezes at the sound Like a ghost just brushed
through him

SANCIERRE
Anna

He chases after her VOICE

Sancierre rushes in abandon through the winding trenches
Walls of mud blurring past faster and faster He twists
left and right and left and runs right into Kaylan

They stare at each other with shocked expressions
Sancierre winces in pain His eyes take on a glassy
expression He looks down to see the hilt of a sword
protruding from his abdomen Realizes hes run headlong

into Kaylans sword and impaled himself

The two men stand eye to eye Kaylan is frozen in disbelief
A confused expression comes over Sancierres face

SANCIERRE (CONTD)
Anna

He lets out a sharp GASP and pitches forward Kaylan catches
him as he falls

KAYLAN
Oh God No no no
(calling out)
LaVey Felson Help me

LaVey and Felson stop in their tracks turn around and race
back through the trench

Kaylan is on his knees holding Sancierre SCREAMING for help

KAYLAN (CONTD)
LaVey LaVey Where are you

OUTSIDE THE TRENCHES

Hagaman brings the wagon to a halt He and DeBelzaq hear
Kaylans cry for help and make their way to him

INSIDE THE TRENCHES
LaVey and Felson arrive to find Kaylan holding Sancierre

KAYLAN (CONTD)
He came running out of nowhere
Why didnt he stop Why didnt
he see me Dear God What have
I done

LaVey drops to Sancierres side Sees the blood spurting
from his wound Theres nothing he can do

FELSON
(to Kaylan)
It was dark Its not your fault
boy It was an accident
(Felson takes his arm)
Come on

Felson helps Kaylan to his feet

DeBelzaq and Hagaman reach the trenches in time to see
Sancierre shudder and die

KAYLAN
(pained and bewildered)
Why didnt he see me He looked
me in the eye but he called me
Anna Why

Theres a RUSTLING sound

LaVey turns thrusting his torch into the dark to illuminate
the Girl cowering against the muddy wall of the trench

LAVEY
(to Felson)
Take her back to the wagon

GIRL
Dont hurt me

Felson reaches for the Girl She hammers her foot into his
groin The unsuspecting Knight drops to his knees in pain
A heel to his face sends him splashing back into the muck
The Girl leaps on top of him Forces Felsons head under
the muddy oil

THOOMP A boot to the jaw sends her reeling into the muck
face first Out cold

LaVey helps Felson to his feet Steps over to the Girl
grabs her by the back of her tunic and lift her torso out
of the muck Stops short at something he sees

LAVEYS POV

Her tunic is pulled away revealing her bare back The
wounds he saw there the night before are gone Her skin is
unbroken Untouched

LaVey is shocked He lets go of her Her head plops back
into the muck He stands there doubting his own eyes

Someone touches his shoulder Startled LaVey snaps a look
behind him to see Felson standing there Felson sees the
look in LaVeys eyes

FELSON
You all right

LaVey nods unconvincingly

LAVEY
Get her back to the wagon

Felson moves to the Girl
EXT GRAVEMOUND - DAWN

A makeshift cross Two pieces of wood tied together thrust
into the earth A lonely sight

LaVey DeBelzaq and the others are standing over the grave

DEBELZAQ

We pray Thee take thy servant
Sancierre Bertrand into the
heavenly realm for he was a
soldier of the cross and fought
in thy name and in the name of
thy only son Jesus Christ

(beat)
And thus did he die for the
glory of God Amen

A few whispered amens from the group
All but LaVey who simply looks up into the rain swept skies
DEBELZAQ (CONTD)

Would anyone else care to offer
some words

No response Finally LaVey breaks the silence

LAVEY
Let his sacrifice not be in vain

EXT CAMPSITE - MOMENTS LATER

LaVey and Hagaman are saddling their horses when DeBelzaq
approaches LaVey

DEBELZAQ
We must warn the others to be
diligent in her presence and not
to discuss personal matters things

she might

LAVEY
Please Just say whats on your
mind

DEBELZAQ
I believe Sancierres death was no
accident

Hagaman is all ears

LAVEY
Are you suggesting that Kaylan
intended to do him harm

DEBELZAQ

No The witch

(beat)
You heard what he said Sancierre
called him by his daughters name
Anna

(beat)
It was the witch who lured him
to his death

LAVEY
Why What reason did she have

DEBELZAQ
Evil neednt a reason merely
the opportunity

Dismissing the remark LaVey turns to mount his horse
DeBelzaq stops him

DEBELZAQ (CONTD)
She can see the darkness that lurks
in our hearts And what she sees
there she will use against us

The ring of truth in his words strikes a nerve in LaVey
He looks to the wagon and finds the Girl watching them

He strides over to the wagon pulls a rain tarp from behind
the bench seat and drapes it over the cage

FADE TO BLACK
EXT FOREST - AFTERNOON
Imposing rock formations are creeping into the landscape
EXT WAGON - MOVING - CONTINUOUS
The Knights have resumed their journey Hagaman is in the
lead Kaylan is at the reigns of the wagon DeBelzaq is

seated alongside him

DEBELZAQ
It was not your fault

Kaylan doesnt bother to respond to the remark

DEBELZAQ (CONTD)
You may take comfort in the fact
you did not kill him It was the
witch No one else

KAYLAN
He died by my sword

DEBELZAQ
It could just as easily have been
Felsons or LaVeys

KAYLAN
But it wasn’t It was mine
I killed him

HAGAMAN (0OS)
LaVey

CUT TO

EXT BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS

LaVey and Felson come galloping up to find Hagaman looking
out over the BROKEN REMAINS OF A BRIDGE The raging currents
below have washed away everything but a few stubborn pylons
that jut out of the water

FELSON
Wonderful What do we do now
swim

HAGAMAN

We could go back

LAVEY
(snaps at Hagaman)
Back to the stockades you mean

LaVey glares at Hagaman daring him to pursue his remark
further

HAGAMAN
(reconsidering)
Ive heard tell of another bridge
to the North
LaVey looks to Felson for his reaction
FELSON
(shrugs )
What choice do we have
LAVEY
(to Hagaman)
Lead the way
EXT MOUNTAINS - AFTERNOON

The wagon winds its way further up into the mountains Steep
canyon walls close in on the trail

EXT MOUNTAIN TRAIL - MOMENTS LATER

At the rear of the wagon LaVey and Felson are riding
together when the wagon comes to a stop

FELSON
Why are we stopping

LAVEY
Now what is it

The two men spur their horses forward to see whats caused
the delay

ROPE BRIDGE

LaVey and Felson ride up to find a frustrated Hagaman kicking
the dirt around him And for good reason Ahead of them a
DECREPIT OLD ROPE BRIDGE hangs suspended across the canyon

The Knights stare at it distrustfully

FELSON
(accusingly to Hagaman)
You call that a bridge

HAGAMAN
I said Id heard tell of it
not that Id seen it myself

FELSON
(in disgust)
This is what we get for taking a
criminal as our guide

HAGAMAN
Youre blaming me for the bridge

FELSON
Damn right I am

While they continue to argue LaVey swings down from his
saddle and leads his horse towards

ROPE BRIDGE

LaVey peers down through the weathered planks to the canyon
below Its a thousand foot drop if its an inch with death
beckoning from every ragged outcropping along the way

Felsons focus shifts past Hagaman to LaVey as

LaVey steps gingerly onto the bridge surface testing it
The planks CREAK softly beneath him

FELSON (0S) (CONTD)
LaVey Are you mad

LaVeys not listening He takes another step And another
Draws his horse behind him onto the bridge The planks
GROAN The animal doesnt like this one bit and WHINNIES in
protest but LaVey tightens the reins and coaxes it along

In the background the others gather to watch

LaVey passes the mid-way point No turning back now He
continues to make his way across slowly and methodically

The only sound he can hear is the WIND HOWLING off the canyon
walls A SUDDEN GUST causes the bridge to sway

LaVey braces himself His horse WHINNIES Together they
take the remaining paces to reach

THE OTHER SIDE
LaVey looks back with relief

LAVEY
(cupping his hands to
shout)
Take everything off the wagon
Bring the horses across One
by one

Hagaman swallowing hard

HAGAMAN
Dear God Hes going to make us
try it

EXT ROPE BRIDGE - A WHILE LATER

The horses have all been brought across All that remains
now is the wagon itself

The men are circled around it glancing nervously back and
forth between it and the rickety bridge

HAGAMAN
This is insanity

LAVEY
Trust me the bridge will hold so
long as we dont stop We cannot
let the weight of the wagon bear
down on any of those weathered
planks for long

FELSON
Well I for one have no interest
in stopping out there Do any of
you

The others nod in agreement

FELSON (CONTD)
Good Then lets get on with it
shall we

LAVEY

Felson Kaylan and I will take

the rear Hagaman and DeBelzaq

man the hitches at the front
They move to their positions
FRONT OF THE WAGON
Hagaman takes one of the two hitches under his arm and
secures it with the palm of his other hand DeBelzaq takes
the other hitch does the same
REAR OF THE WAGON

LaVey and Felson each take a corner position behind the rear
wheel Kaylan inherits the center

With LaVey giving the commands the men slowly begin
maneuvering the wagon across the bridge It takes all of
their strength to move the iron-laden wagon forward

THE WAGON WHEELS

Roll onto the surface The planks immediately begin to
GROAN under the excess weight A round of nervous glances

ROPE BRIDGE

As the wagon inches its way across we can HEAR the ropes
STRAINING and the wood CREAKING

FRONT OF THE WAGON
DeBelzaq is struggling to keep the wheels straight His
grip on the hitch so tight his injured hand is bleeding
through the bandages The pain is excruciating
REAR OF THE WAGON
LaVey feels the bridge sway He looks to the front sees
that DeBelzaqs hitch has skewed to the right and is taking
the wagon with it

LAVEY (CONTD)

DeBelzaq Keep the wagon centered
or shell tip

Kaylan is leaning into the wagon with everything hes got
when he loses his footing and nearly goes down

He looks to the plank beneath him Sees a smear of blood
across it and a fresh trail of blood on the boards ahead
of him
LAVEY (CONTD)
DeBelzaq Did you hear me
DeBelzaq

KAYLAN
LaVey

Kaylan directs his attention to the bloodied trail

LaVey calls a halt to their efforts He has Kaylan take his
position and he makes his way to

FRONT OF THE WAGON

DeBelzag has his hand concealed when LaVey reaches him
LaVey takes his arm revealing the bloodied mess Its bad

LAVEY
Take a position ahead Make sure
we keep the wagon centered

DeBelzaq is in too much pain to argue and does as hes told

The wind HOWLS through the canyon causing the bridge to sway
precariously

LaVey picks up the bloodied hitch
HAGAMAN
I suppose its too late to take you
up on that offer on the stockade
huh
LaVey has to laugh Hagaman too as he picks up his hitch

HAGAMAN (CONTD)
I thought so

ROPE BRIDGE
The wagon is barely half way across And with only two men
left to push at the rear the wagons movement is no longer

a smooth continuous motion but rather a herky-jerky start-
stop action With each plank an obstacle to be overcome

And just as the men gather some momentum and get the wagons
wheels rolling again

CRACK One of the planks splinters under the weight of a
rear wheel Kaylan drops from sight Only to be jerked to
a stop at the last instant

Dangling over the abyss he looks up to see the Girl peering
down at him He realizes shes just reached through the bars
of the cage and saved his life

GIRL
Where do you think youre going

When Kaylan sees that shes holding him by his wrist with
one hand HE FREAKS Starts flailing about

KAYLAN
Felson Help

The rear of the wagon suddenly tips to the left under the
added stress

KAYLAN (CONTD)
Felson

Felson appears He grabs Kaylans other hand and pulls him
back up

FRONT OF THE WAGON

Unaware of whats happened LaVey is SHOUTING to Felson and
Kaylan to push the damn wagon

REAR OF THE WAGON

Felson and Kaylan get back to it but its harder than ever
to get the wagon moving again Both men give it everything
theyve got When the wheels finally do start to roll the
planks beneath them GROAN and CREAK loudly

The GROANING and CREAKING sounds suddenly give way to
CRACKING sounds as the planks beneath the wheels begin
splintering on contact

LAVEY
It wont hold PUSH

Kaylan and Felson can feel the wood disintegrating beneath
their feet

GIRL (0S)
Push fools Or well all perish
Push for your lives

THE WAGON

Bumping and clattering along faster and faster The far
side looming into view So close Just a few more yards

END OF THE BRIDGE

They make it across

The wagon rolls to a stop The men collapse to the ground
exhausted

LAVEY AND DEBELZAQ

LAVEY
Lets see that hand

LaVey unwraps the blood-soaked bandage from DeBelzaqs injured
hand Takes a look at the wound Its bad He rolls a look
to Felson

FELSON
(shrugs )
Ive seen worse

LAVEY
If it gets infected he could
lose the hand

FELSON
No doubt

LaVey extends his hand to Felson Begrudgingly Felson pulls
a silver flask from his person passes it to him LaVey
pours the alcohol on the wound DeBelzaq winces in pain
Felson too at the waste of good liquor

LAVEY
This needs fresh bandaging
Kaylan Fetch the bag from
beneath the seat
FRONT OF THE WAGON

Kaylan climbs up and grabs the bag He turns to jump down
but stops noticing something

KAYLAN
(calls out baffled)
Where are the horses

LaVey is first to his feet
FRONT OF THE WAGON
He joins Kaylan
KAYLAN (CONTD)
I could see them from the bridge
earlier
(pointing off camera)
They were there Right there
Felson and the others catch up
LAVEY
(eyes straining
realizing)

They still are

REVERSE ANGLE

LaVey WHISTLES We hear the horses NEIGH but we cant see them
Because a fog has crept in and enveloped the entire valley ahead

FELSON
What is this place Where are we

LaVey looks into the mist

LAVEY
(a sinking realization)
If I were to venture a guess Id
say precisely where wed hoped not
to be
(beat)
Wormwood Forest

EXT FOREST - DUSK

The fog continues to descend upon the valley drifting
between the trees in long tendrils suffusing everything in
a ghostly pallor

The road has dwindled to a narrow dirt path barely wide

enough for the wagon Kaylan now holds the reins DeBelzaq
seated next to him is unnerved by the surroundings

KAYLAN
They say there are places in the
deepest parts of this forest where
the sunlight doesn’t penetrate at
all where everything is shrouded
forever in gloom

FELSON (0OS)
They say worse things than that

DeBelzaq looks to Felson riding alongside the wagon

DEBELZAQ
What What else do they say

Felson chooses not to answer He rides ahead to join LaVey
Off DeBelzaq’s worried expression
EXT FOREST PATH - CONTINUOUS

Felson rides up alongside LaVey He finds him eyeing the
tree tops high overhead

LAVEY
Its no wonder they tell stories
of those whove entered these
woods never to be seen again
(beat)

Between the dense tree cover and
this fog days could pass without
so much as a glimpse of the sun

FELSON
(dawning on him)
Without it or a reliable map one
could easily find oneself traveling
in circles Endlessly

LAVEY
(looks to Felson)
Not endlessly my friend Only
until our supplies run out
Felson finds little consolation in LaVeys remark

EXT FOREST PATH - DUSK

The fog has grown thicker With visibility reduced to a few
paltry yards the silhouetted procession has slowed to a crawl

Each of the men takes in the ominous surroundings

Felson rides alongside the wagon Hes trying to keep sight
of Hagaman up ahead
EXT FOREST PATH - CONTINUOUS

Felson comes riding up to join Hagaman whos squinting into
the fog

HAGAMAN
Damnable fog is like a veil before
my eyes

FELSON

Are you sure we havent strayed
from the main road

HAGAMAN
How can I be sure of anything when
I can barely see my own hand before
my face

FELSON
Hardly the reassuring words Id
expect from our guide

HAGAMAN
Would you prefer I lie to you

LaVey watches the arguement escalate

FELSON
Id prefer you do your job

HAGAMAN
(taking in the
surroundings)
The situation only worsens We
should stop and wait for this fog
to pass

FELSON
And if it doesnt

HAGAMAN
Then perhaps you should take the
lead
Angered Felson turns his horse to face Hagaman
FELSON

(confrontational)
Perhaps I will

LaVey rides up Reins his horse to a stop

LAVEY
Enough Both of you
(looks around)
Well camp here for the night
The two of you can take the
first watch

EXT CAMPSITE - NIGHT

The campfire flickers amidst the heavy fog thats settled in
for the night

The men sit around the fire eating It’s cold We can see
their breaths LaVey rises grabs a torch makes his way
to

THE WAGON

He grabs a blanket from the supplies box Lifts up the tarp
to find the Girl huddled at the back of the cage He tosses
the blanket to her

LAVEY (CONTD)
You may need that tonight

There’s something else on LaVey’s mind Finally

LAVEY (CONTD)
Kaylan told me what happened out
there on the bridge Says you
saved his life With one hand no
less Hard to believe

The Girl picks up the blanket

LAVEY (CONTD)
Then again if I hadnt seen the
wounds to your back with my own
eyes I wouldnt believe youd
ever suffered them

She wraps the blanket around her
GIRL
We believe what we want to believe
(beat)
Do you believe I’m a witch LaVey

He doesnt offer a response

The flame of his torch suddenly flickers out LaVeys in
darkness for an instant before the flame flickers back to life

The Girls face now pressed against the bars of the cage
only inches from LaVey

GIRL (CONTD)
Youre not afraid of me are you

She reaches through the bars LaVey backs away She grabs
the tarp and pulls it down Laughing to herself

FADE TO BLACK
EXT CAMPSITE - LATER
Felson is propped against a tree trunk having dozed off
A SHADOW crosses his face Its Hagaman He appears anxious

sweat beads across his forehead A crossbow is clutched in
his hand

THE WAGON
The campfire light plays upon the tarp that shrouds the cage

Hagaman steps up to the cage He quietly reaches for a corner
of the tarp

LAVEY (0S)
Trouble sleeping

Startled Hagaman spins around sees nothing Until LaVey
steps from the dense fog not fifteen feet from him Hagaman
lowers the crossbow to his side but theres no concealing
his intent

LAVEY (CONTD)
Myself as well
(eyeing the crossbow)
Not sure if its the fog the
altitude or just my nerves
(beat)
And you

Hagaman just shrugs LaVey approaches him
LAVEY (CONTD)
Although under the circumstances

nerves would be understandable
even for a Knight

HAGAMAN
Let alone a spineless scoundrel
like myself

LAVEY
That is not what I meant by it

HAGAMAN
No

Hagaman stares at LaVey as if contemplating the sincerity
of his remark Finally

HAGAMAN (CONTD)
How many more of us are going to
die LaVey Before we reach

Severac
LAVEY

None If I can help it
HAGAMAN

And if you cant Then what

(beat)
Youll have to forgive me if Im
reluctant to put my life in your
hands but you see
(indicating his crossbow)
I have a better solution We kill
the bitch here and now and be
done with it We tell those back
at Avignon that she tried to
escape She meant us harm What
could we do We had no choice
(beat)
And who would be the wiser

FELSON (0S)
I for one

Surprised Hagaman turns into FELSONS FOREARM It sends him
to the ground Felson takes the crossbow from him

LAVEY
Sorry did we wake you
FELSON
Forgive me I was more tired than

I thought

They are interrupted by a SOUND coming from beneath the tarp
A strange kind of GIBBERISH Guttural and harsh

Hagaman gets to his feet chilled by what he hears

LaVey grabs the nearest torch and steps to the cage He

lifts the tarp to find the Girl hunched in the back of the
wagon on all fours like an animal She arches her neck
cranes her face upwards and emits an altogether inhuman
sound the BAYING of a WOLF

It awakens the others

EXT DEEP IN THE FOREST - CONTINUOUS

The unholy SOUND ECHOES through the dark resonating with evil
The horses stamp their hooves nervously

EXT CAMPSITE - CONTINUOUS

Felson moves to the edge of the path and stares out into the
fog Senses something

DeBelzaq and Kaylan join the others
DEBELZAQ
What is it Whats going on
We heard
FELSON
Shhhh
(listening)
Theres something out there
KAYLAN
(to Felson)
What is it What do you hear

DEBELZAQ
Men on horseback Thieves perhaps

Felson shakes his head

DEBELZAQ (CONTD)
What then

FELSON
Something hungrier

Felson draws his sword

From the depths of the forest comes a chilling sound The
lone CRY of a WOLF

DEBELZAQ
She has summoned wolves

HAGAMAN
What do we do

LaVey hands Hagaman back his crossbow

LAVEY
Kill them Before they kill us

LaVey draws his sword Kaylan too

In the distance the HOWLING multiplies Growing LOUDER
Nearer

LaVey joins Felson

LAVEY (CONTD)
How many do you make it

FELSON
(listening)
Three Or four

LaVey hears some HOWLS off to their right

LAVEY
More Six Maybe eight

Felson picks up still more activity to their left

FELSON
Ten At least

Suddenly the HOWLING stops The forest goes deathly still
The men watch as through the dense fog DARK HULKING FORMS
begin to appear Gray shapes gathering Moving within the
fog Closing in surrounding the campsite

INSIDE THE CAGE

A thin smile spreads over the Girls lips She SNARLS aloud
and

THE WOLVES CHARGE

Bristling monstrous shapes come hurtling out of the fog

LaVey brings his sword up in a low WHISTLING arc striking
the first wolf in mid-leap cleaving it in half

Felson thrusts his blade through the next to show itself
killing the beast instantly

Hagaman sees the one leaping for his throat He fires his
crossbow

The arrow hits the wolf in the leg bringing it down but not
for good

Hagaman has no more arrows

The wounded animal gets back on its feet Fangs bared its
about to pounce on the defenseless Hagaman when

DeBelzaq plunges a sword into it killing it
DEBELZAQ
(horrified)
Pater Noster
He passes the sword to Hagaman
Kaylan stabs at one of the airborne carnivores impaling it
through the chest The creature CRASHES to the ground

taking Kaylans sword with it Kaylan goes to retrieve it

FELSON (0S)
Kaylan Look out

WHAM Kaylan is knocked to the ground by a hurtling mass
of gray Buried under a mountain of fur and snapping teeth
hes struggling to keep the creature from his throat

Suddenly WHOOT Its decapitated from behind Its head
tumbles loose jaws spilling open

Kaylan looks up to see its Felson He saved his life
The big man spins away without a word

Kaylan gets to his feet and retrieves his sword

Wolves attack from every direction

The men swing their swords stabbing and thrusting with every
ounce of their strength Matching ferocity with ferocity

LaVey meeting each ravenous beast head-on
Felson chopping and hacking with the fervor of a madman

Until finally all is quiet And a dozen wolves lie dead

LaVey still eyeing the fog calls out the mens names
Each responds The last he calls is Felsons

FELSON (0S) (CONTD)
You know LaVey if Id known that
returning to my homeland was going
to prove this trying Id have
remained in Constantinople At
least there we were only out-
numbered three to one

Absurd but true LaVey has to LAUGH Felson too The others
join in Until

They hear it A SOUND in the distance One that seems to
echo from every corner of the forest The SOUND of HOWLING
A HUNDRED WOLVES HOWLING

LAVEY
Get to the horses Quickly

The men take off
CAMPSITE

The Girl’s LAUGHTER echoes in the fog as the Knights race to
their mounts

All around them the CACOPHONY OF HOWLING grows louder Nearer
LaVey leaps into the wagon and whips the reins The horses bolt
Felson Kaylan and Hagaman spur their horses after the wagon
FOREST PATH

The wagon and horsemen THUNDER past racing blindly through
the mist

LaVey risks a glance over his shoulder Nothing but fog
Then a glimpse A dark sleek shape And another

The wolves are tearing through thickets moving with horrible
speed

LaVey spurs the horses faster

The wagon careens wildly around a bend

THE REAR OF THE WAGON
Felson and Kaylan glimpse the WOLF PACK gaining on them

The PACK splits in two as the wolves begin to overtake the
wagon

Felson and Kaylan split off to flank the wagon on either side

Hagaman is holding his position when suddenly a great gray
mass explodes from the ridge overlooking the path Taking
Hagaman and his horse crashing to the ground

Felson catches the action out of the corner of his eye and
stops

Kaylan notices that the pack of wolves that were flanking
them have stopped their pursuit He looks back to see Hagaman
on the ground He slows his horse and calls out to LaVey to
stop

LaVey brings the wagon to a halt looks back
Hagaman is on the ground He manages to get to his feet
Makes it to where his horse is sprawled Tries to pull it up

and sees the animal is dead It’s neck broken by the fall

GROWL

Hagaman turns to see the wolf that took him down back on its
feet

Skulking shapes emerge from the fog to join it
Hagaman spots his sword on the ground Picks it up

As the wolves encircle him he shoots a last look to LaVey
They share a momentary glance

FELSON
(to LaVey)
We cannot save him
LaVey finally pulls himself away spurs the team of horses as
Hagaman wheels around to face the wolves He pulls something

from his pocket We recognize it as the small stone he tried
to sell Felson He clutches it tightly

HAGAMAN
(gripping his sword)
Come on then Which of you wants
to be first

They all come at once

EXT FOREST PATH - DAWN

The fog is beginning to break Through the canopy of trees
we glimpse the first rays of dawn Hear the HOWL of a
solitary wolf as it echoes through the forest

EXT FOREST CLEARING - CONTINUOUS

LaVey brings the wagon to a stop A troubled look on his

face The events weigh heavily on him He reaches behind
the seat pulls out a crossbow jumps down from the wagon
and steps to the back of the cage

DEBELZAQ
No LaVey

LaVey undoes a corner of the tarp

DeBelzaq dismounts and rushes to stop him

LaVey flips the covering back exposing the Girl
DeBelzaq throws himself between LaVey and the Girl

DEBELZAQ (CONTD)
What are you doing

GIRL
Hes doing what comes naturally
Arent you LaVey

DEBELZAQ
You cannot do this

LAVEY

Step away from the cage
(training the crossbow on
DeBelzaq)
Two lives have already been lost

DEBELZAQ
And no one grieves more than I
over that but

LAVEY
(finger on the trigger)
Then step away Or so help me
this arrow will be yours

DEBELZAQ
If we falter now then those lives
will have been lost in vain

LAVEY
Maybe so But at least all will
not have been lost At least four
lives will be spared

DEBELZAQ
And what are four lives compared
to the thousands more that will be
lost if this plague is not ended

(pleading)

I know there is no room in your
heart for God LaVey But in my
heart I know he would not abandon
us I believe it is God’s will
that we complete

LAVEY
(exploding with grief)
“Gods will All of my life has
been spent in service of “Gods
will No man has spilt more blood
in God’s name than I

DEBELZAQ
But if you kill her you will
not have God to blame only

yourself
Realizing DeBelzag is right LaVey lowers his crossbow

LAVEY
(lamenting)
Surely a benevolent God would
not ask such things of men
(beat)
And a malevolent God is no
God at all

Debelzaq knows theres no response that he can offer the
faithless Knight

FELSON (0S)
LaVey

LaVey looks to Felson Felson directs his attention to
A MOUNTAIN RANGE

FELSON (CONTD)
The end is in sight

There looming from the mist hewn out of the mountainside
is a MONASTERY

DEBELZAQ
Abbey Severac

EXT FOOTHILLS RISING - DAY

A cold wind blows as the wagon ascends the inhospitable
terrain

EXT ROCKY PASS - LATER

Felson and LaVey are riding together behind the wagon
Their tattered cloaks in tight Felson peers at LaVey

FELSON
Weve come a long way LaVey

LaVey nods slowly Not sure where this is going

FELSON (CONTD)
When this is over I think I would
like to see the valley where I was
born
(beat)
And you

LAVEY
(a shrug
I have no such yearnings for home

FELSON
Then come with me I will show
you my home
(its settled)
We will sit in the hall where my
forefathers sat and drink ale
and tell tales that few men have
lived to tell

LAVEY
And fewer still will believe are
true

Felson LAUGHS pulls out his flask

FELSON
Ah but we will know my friend
We will know
(toasting)
To your health

He takes a drink passes the flask to LaVey
LAVEY
(toasting)
And yours
LaVey enjoys a drink

EXT ROAD TO SEVERAC - AFTERNOON

Through the trees ABBEY SEVERAC comes into view The end of
the journey is truly in sight

EXT THE ABBEY - MOMENTS LATER
LaVey and the others arrive Before them the abbeys massive

stone walls extend upwards thirty feet Thick as time Built
to withstand a siege

LaVey swings down from his horse and approaches the entrance
Two massive oaken doors reinforced with steel He takes hold
of one of the brass knockers and BANGS it The SOUND echoes

faintly within The men await a response There is none

LaVey peers up to the top of the parapet cups his hands to
his mouth and SHOUTS

LAVEY
Hello

No response except the lonely SOUND of his ECHO He tries
again louder

LAVEY (CONTD)
Is anyone there

Still nothing He looks back at the others puzzled
INT ABBEY COURTYARD - MOMENTS LATER

A rope falls into view Then Kaylan himself He drops to
the ground Looks around

The courtyard is deserted

Kaylan pushes the heavy bolt aside to open the gates
The Knights come riding in taking in the empty space

DEBELZAQ
Perhaps theyre in vespers

LaVey dismounts Felson and DeBelzaq do the same
INT ABBEY CHAPEL - AFTERNOON

The outer doors are thrust open LaVey stands framed in the
entrance staring in

LAVEY
Gentlemen Could you not hear us
at the gate

A handful of BENEDICTINE MONKS are in the pews
DeBelzaq brushes past LaVey and makes his way into the chapel

DEBELZAQ
Forgive the intrusion my brothers
but our journey has been a long
and dif

DeBelzaq stop abruptly LaVey knows somethings wrong

He makes his way down the aisle to discover that the monks
are dead All of them victims of the plague Their still
forms frozen in the pews their last moments spent in prayer

DeBelzaq sinks to his knees His eyes pressed shut his lips
moving fervently

DEBELZAQ (CONTD)
(muttered)
Lord in Heaven hallowed be Thy
name

LAVEY
DeBelzaq We have to leave
Every moment in this place brings
us closer to death

DEBELZAQ
(without looking up)
And go where This place the
monks they were our last hope
Our fate is in Gods hands now
Prayer is our only salvation

LAVEY
Your prayers are wasted

DEBELZAQ
(ignoring him)
On earth as it is in Heaven Give
us this day our daily bread

LAVEY
He cant hear you DeBelzaq

DEBELZAQ
(louder )
And forgive our trespasses as we

LAVEY
Get up

But DeBelzaq just keeps praying
DEBELZAQ
Forgive those who trespass against
us and lead us not into temptation
but

LAVEY
I said get up

He hauls the startled priest to his feet
VOICE (0S)
(faint)
Deliver us from evil

Both men freeze

VOICE (CONTD)
Ammmeeeen

LaVey and DeBelzaq realize the VOICE is coming from behind
the altar They rush forward galvanized by sudden hope to
find

A DYING MONK

Lying in a pool of his own blood his face covered with
lesions and boils its a miracle hes still alive

DeBelzaq proceeds to give the dying man the last rites

DEBELZAQ
In nominee patri espiritu sancti

The monk struggles to draw the mens attention to something
gesturing towards the altar

LaVey steps to the altar Sees something

LAVEY
DeBelzaq

DeBelzaq finishes the prayer over the deceased monk He
wipes the tears from his eyes and joins LaVey

THE ALTAR

Arrayed atop it are a silver flask a wooden cross a purple
cassock

DEBELZAQ
They knew we were coming All was
in readiness

--and something draped in a velvet cloth

DeBelzaq removes the cloth to reveal a LARGE LEATHER-BOUND
BOOK Ancient Its pages gold-leafed Embossed on the
cover in Latin are the words

DEBELZAQ (CONTD)
El Libre del Vermis

LAVEY
What is it

DEBELZAQ

(with awe)
The Book of Solomon The one
the Cardinal spoke of A book
of great wisdom

(he touches it)
Within these pages are said to
be all of the ancient rituals
and incantations by which the
biblical King Solomon The Great
cast out evil from the land of
the Hebrews

DeBelzaq opens the book Begins thumbing through its pages

CUT TO

EXT COURTYARD - NIGHT

The doors of the chapel swing open LaVey Felson and
Kaylan accompany DeBelzagq to

THE WAGON

GIRL
(cocking her head back)
Ah yes And what have we here
(to LaVey)
Is this the fair trial you
promised me

DeBelzaq places the Book of Solomon on a table thats been
provided him He commences by drawing the sign of the cross
in the air and sprinkling some holy water in the direction
of the wagon

DEBELZAQ
Let it be known to all present
and before God Himself that this
woman stands accused of witchcraft
That she has admitted to calling
up a plague to destroy every man
woman and child

GIRL
You give me too much credit Im
flattered to be sure but I must
confess I lied to you I have
called up no plague

DEBELZAQ
You think you can save yourself
by recanting but you are wrong
Admit your guilt witch Speak
the truth now before God

GIRL
The truth is that you are fools
All of you Frightened ignorant
fools The truth is that this
pestilence you accuse me of
spreading was brought to your
shores by merchant ships from the
East

DEBELZAQ
That is a lie

GIRL
No A lie is what youve chosen
to believe What you wanted your
followers to believe

DeBelzaq doesnt like where this is going and proceeds with
the reading of the ritual

DEBELZAQ
(reading in Latin)
Ecce crucem domine fugite partes
advérsae Adjuro te serpens
antique

The Girl looks upon herself with an eerie detachment

GIRL
You saw this pathetic creature as
someone to blame for your problems
Someone you could do away with and
everything would be right again

LaVey sees that the Girls derisive remarks are unnerving
DeBelzaq He draws his sword as if to quiet the Girl
She turns and unleashes her venom on him

GIRL (CONTD)

And you LaVey you saw me as
the innocent child you wanted to
protect Save

(beat)
Did you really think that saving
one would make up for all of those
you cut down with that very sword
you hold in your hand

LaVey is stunned by her awareness of his private most thoughts
DeBelzaq continues to read the ritual

LAVEY
(defensive)
I did what was asked of me as a
Knight

GIRL
Of course you did And quickly
learned that it’s easier to take
orders than it is responsibility
for your actions

FELSON
You know not of what you speak
How could you You were not
there

GIRL
Ah but I was
(back to LaVey)
I was there when you attacked the
port of Lajazzo By your side when
we pillaged the Archipelago

LaVey and Felson share a look of disbelief at the Girls
knowledge of these events

DeBelzaq sees their reactions He realizes impossible though
it may seem the Girl knows of what she speaks He frantically
begins flipping through the pages of the Book of Solomon

The Girl steps towards LaVeys side of the cage

GIRL (CONTD)
I led the charge on Smyrna that
moonless night

FELSON
(to DeBelzaq)
Finish the ritual and silence
this witch

DEBELZAQ
She is no witch
(still searching the
pages)
No witch can know as she knows

LAVEY
(to Girl)
You lie Was Dragonet of Leon led
us that night

At the bars of the cage the Girl smiles

GIRL
(in the voice of Commander
Dragonet)
They are a godless people Infidels
Who have killed our brethren They
must not go unpunished Wipe them
out All of them Spare no one

LaVey is dumbstruck

From off-screen DeBelzaqs VOICE rings out anew

DEBELZAQ (0S)
Exi ergo transgressor Exi
sedtictor plene omni dolo et
falldcia

The Girl whips around to see the priest once again reading
from the sacred book But its a very different ritual
prayer that he now reads

DEBELZAQ (CONTD)
Virtiatis inimici innocéntium
persecutor

GIRL

Do not utter those words foul
hypocrite

DEBELZAQ
Recéde ergo nunc adjuradtos in
nominee ejus

The Girl writhes and hisses with each phrase spoken

GIRL
Ill rip out your tongue

DEBELZAQ
Ab hdémine quiem ipse plasmavit

The Girl spreads her arms like some malevolent angel of
darkness

DEBELZAQ (CONTD
What manner of demon are you

A sudden gust of frigid wind buffets the priest

In her fervent struggle to resist the power of the ritual
the Girl grabs hold of the bars on either side of the cage

DEBELZAQ (CONTD
Durum est tibi velle resistere

The bars begin rattling The metal itself seems to GROAN
The Knights watch in disbelief

DeBelzaq SHOUTS to be heard

DEBELZAQ (CONTD)
YOUR NAME SPEAK IT

The Girl is trembling with rage shuddering using every
ounce of her being to resist the power of the ritual

DEBELZAQ (CONTD)
Durum est tibi velle resistere

DEBELZAQ (CONTD)
I COMMAND YOU SPEAK YOUR NAME

When she can resist no longer the Girl whirls to face DeBelzaq

GIRL
(proclaiming)
I AM LUCIFER you stinking maggot

Her fists clench tightly around the bars of the cage until
the lead itself begins to smoke and smolder The black iron
glows red hot and melts like wax before our eyes forming
molten pools on the floor of the cage The air fills with
smoke and through it the Girl walks free

She stalks towards DeBelzaq

Terrified he flees for the refuge of the chapel

INT CHAPEL - CONTINUOUS

DeBelzaq spills through the doors with the Girl on his heels
But she stops short of entering the sacred place

Seeing this DeBelzaq has the wherewithal to find his place
in the sacred book and resume reading the ritual

DEBELZAQ
Quia quanto taérdius exis tanto
magis tibi supplicium crescit

Almost immediately the ritual again begins having an adverse
effect on the Girl

With an enraged HOWL she spins away stirring the dirt and
debris of the courtyard into a blinding dust storm

The Knights shield their eyes from the maelstrom

By the time its settled the Girl has vanished

DEBELZAQ (0S) (CONTD)
God forgive me

The Knights turn to find a frustrated and emotionally
drained DeBelzagq

DEBELZAQ (CONTD)
If Id only finished the ritual
Lucifer would be back in hell where
he belongs and the girl that
poor girl would be safe And free
of him

FELSON
We had our chance Hes gone

LaVey is wrestling with the thoughts in his head

LAVEY
Im not so sure of that

The others look to him

LAVEY (CONTD)

(to DeBelzaq)
You were right when you said
she could see the darkness in
our hearts

(beat)
She used it to deceive me into
changing my mind and agreeing
to deliver her here

DEBELZAQ
Nonsense This is the last place
that evil would choose to come

LAVEY
Is it Do you recall how she
struggled when we went to collect
her from her cell that morning

DEBELZAQ
How could I not

LAVEY
And how she suddenly seemed to
concede when

Felson picks up the thought

FELSON
(to DeBelzaq)
When you told her she was to be
taken here

INT DUNGEON CELL - NIGHT - FLASHBACK

DeBelzaq looks down upon the Girl still fighting furiously
to free herself

DEBELZAQ
Struggle if you like but it
has been decided that you are
to be taken to Severac and

Threateningly he reveals the other half of LaVeys staff
clutched in his fist

DEBELZAQ (CONTD)
one way or another to Severac
you will go

The Girl ceases struggling and slumps back against the cell
wall head down her mane of hair covering her face

We now see something that we didnt see at the time The Girl
expresses a sigh of defeat but through the hair that veils
her face we glimpse a devilish grin

EXT COURTYARD - NIGHT

DEBELZAQ
(realizing)
My God The night Sancierre died
she overheard us arguing

LAVEY
Over what

DEBELZAQ
He didnt want to bring her here
He was convinced she wouldnt
receive a fair trial

INT WAGON CAGE - NIGHT - FLASHBACK

The Girl appears to be sleeping but isnt Shes listening
to the heated exchange between Sancierre and DeBelzaq

SANCIERRE
I will not be a party to this
Nor will the others hopefully
(MORE)

SANCIERRE (CONTD)
when theyve heard what I have
to say
SEETHING WITH RAGE the Girl sits up

GIRL
Wait

Sancierre turns to find

The frightened face and pleading eyes of an innocent young
girl looking at him Tears streaming down her cheeks

EXT COURTYARD - NIGHT

LAVEY
Sancierre stood between her and
Severac

FELSON

So she escaped and we followed

DEBELZAQ
(to Kaylan)
And Sancierre ran upon your sword

FELSON
(to LaVey)
And if you hadn’t awakened the
following night Hagaman would
have killed her in her cage

EXT WAGON - CAMPSITE - NIGHT - FLASHBACK
End of LaVey and Hagaman exchange

HAGAMAN
Youll have to forgive me if
Im reluctant to put my life in
your hands but

INSIDE THE CAGE

The Girl watches Hagamans crossbow-wielding silhouette play
across the tarp

HAGAMAN (0S) (CONTD)
--you see I have a better
solution We kill the bitch here
and now And be done with it

-while plotting his demise

EXT COURTYARD - NIGHT

LAVEY
So she summoned the wolves

KAYLAN
Dozens of them and yet only
one of us falls

FELSON
The one who stood between her
and this place

LAVEY
She still needed the rest of us
to deliver her here
(to Kaylan)
Fortunately for you

EXT ROPE BRIDGE - DAY - FLASHBACK

CRACK One of the planks splinters under the weight of a
rear wheel Kaylan drops from sight

Only to be jerked to a stop at the last instant

Dangling over the abyss Kaylan looks up to see the Girls
hand clasped tightly around his wrist

GIRL
Where do you think youre going

EXT COURTYARD - NIGHT

FELSON
And we know now that she could
have rid herself of that cage at
any time and yet she did not
Why For what reason if not
because she wanted to come here

KAYLAN
But why deceive us into thinking
she was a witch

FELSON
I dont know But LaVey is right
(looking about)
The Devil is still here Somewhere

LAVEY
And we still have a chance to
finish what was started

INT CHAPEL - NIGHT

DeBelzaq places a CRUCIFIX upon the altar and begins the
prayer for Solemn Blessing of the Crucifix

DEBELZAQ
Ut quoties triumphum divinae
humnilitatis quae superbiam
nostri hostis dejecit

INT STORE ROOM - CONTINUOUS
DEBELZAQ (0S)
Dignare respicere bene dicere
et Sancti ficare hanc creatum
LaVey and Felson search for torches
FELSON
I suspect the bad weve done may
well outweigh the good
LAVEY
We have no one to blame for that
but ourselves
They find the torches
INT CHAPEL RECTORY - CONTINUOUS
DEBELZAQ (0S)
Atque insidiar inimici odorem
ejus sentientes effugiant et

separatur a plasmate tuo

Kaylan locates three small flasks He fills them at the holy
water stoup

INT CHAPEL - CONTINUOUS
DeBelzaq finishes the prayer
DEBELZAQ
Numquam laedatur a morsu antiqui

derpentis

He kisses the crucifix and places it around his neck

INT CHAPEL RECTORY - CONTINUOUS
Kaylan is sealing the last flask of holy water LaVey enters

KAYLAN
I managed to find three flasks

LAVEY
Youve done well
(beat)
But now it’s time for you to go

Kaylan stares at him

KAYLAN
Go Go where

LAVEY
Home To Avignon This is not
your battle

KAYLAN
Your battle is my battle

Through the doorway we see Felson approaching He overhears
enough to know not to interrupt

KAYLAN (CONTD)
Besides I gave my word that I
would stay until the job was done
What would those Knights who are
to judge my worthiness think
if I did not

LAVEY
And if it costs you your life

KAYLAN
(cause for pause)
Then that is the price I shall pay

LaVey is moved by the young man’s bravery

LAVEY
Kneel Kaylan

Kaylan slowly sinks to one knee

DeBelzaq joins Felson in watching as LaVey raises his sword
He taps Kaylan slowly on either side

LAVEY (CONTD)
Speak after me
(beat)
Grant me courage oh Lord

KAYLAN
Grant me courage oh Lord

LAVEY
For I am your servant

KAYLAN
For I am your servant

LAVEY
And gird me with strength onto
battle

KAYLAN
(overlapping)
And gird me with strength onto
battle

LAVEY
That I may crush Thine enemies
and bring them down as dust before
the wind

KAYLAN
That I may crush Thine enemies and
bring them down as dust before the

wind
LAVEY
(softly)
Amen
KAYLAN
Amen
LAVEY

Rise a Knight
As he does a wave of uncertainty washes over Kaylan

LAVEY (CONTD)
What is it

KAYLAN

(at a loss for words)
I’m honored truly honored
by your gesture but

FELSON
(entering)
But what Do you or do you not
want to be a Knight Make up
your mind

KAYLAN
I do More than anything

FELSON
Then what is the problem

KAYLAN
I know in my heart that I have
not earned this

FELSON
(leaning in close)
You will

EXT THE ABBEY - NIGHT

Still in the night Like the calm before a storm the only
SOUND is the wind WHISTLING off the ramparts

EXT ABBEY COURTYARD - CONTINUOUS

The rectory door opens DeBelzaq LaVey Kaylan and Felson
exit They make their way across the courtyard

DEBELZAQ
(to LaVey)
Grant me courage oh Lord sounds
like the words of a man of faith

LAVEY
I ve just met the Devil
If the Devil exists so too must
God

EXT ENTRANCE TO THE CENTRAL TOWER - CONTINUOUS

Before entering DeBelzagq sprinkles each of the men with holy
water then makes the sign of the cross in the air blessing

them

DEBELZAQ
May God watch over us all

INT A STONE CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

With a torch in one hand and a sword in the other LaVey
leads the way through the darkened interiors Systematically
eliminating one room after another in their hunt for the
Devil

LaVey hears something Signals for the men to stop From
deep within the abbey the faint sound of CHANTING can be
heard The men share a nervous glance LaVey follows it
INT ABBEY - STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS

The men ascend a flight of stone steps that spiral upwards

INT ABBEY - UPPER CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS

They enter the space From behind one of the doors they
hear the CHANTING

The Knights move towards it
INT THE SCRIPTORIUM - CONTINUOUS
Pitch black Without windows even the ambient glow of the

moon is absent here All that can be seen is what the
torches illuminate

The men stop Listen The CHANTING seems to have abated

Kaylan wheels around with his torch thinking he heard
something He listens Its nothing He lowers his torch
and illuminates the DECAYING CORPSE OF A MONK right beside
him

Startled Kaylan stumbles back

The others gather round for a closer look The dead monk is
seated at a table a quill pen clutched tightly in his grip
He appears to have bound himself to the chair to prevent
himself from toppling over

Felson steps closer to get a better look and kicks something
with his foot He lowers his torch to the floor to see that
its a pail Whats in it sickens him

LAVEY
What is it

FELSON

(disgusted)
The mans guts

LAVEY
What could be so important that
a dying man would make this kind
of sacrifice of himself

DeBelzaq moves closer to examine the leather bound manuscript
atop the table The page the monk was writing is unfinished
DeBelzaq reads a portion of it He turns back through the
previously completed pages to the very first The title reads
THE BOOK OF SOLOMON

DEBELZAQ
He was copying it

FELSON
He must have been mad with
the disease

KAYLAN (0S)
Was he

They look to see Kaylan standing in the darkness ahead of
them He wields his torch to the left to illuminate the
CORPSE OF A SECOND MONK

KAYLAN (CONTD)
And what about him

Swings the torch to his right to reveal A THIRD

KAYLAN (CONTD)
And him

Kaylan backs up illuminating table after table with DEAD
MONKS seated at all of them

KAYLAN (CONTD)
Were they all mad

DEBELZAQ
What in Gods name

DeBelzaq moves from one table to the next with LaVey
following closely his torch providing the illumination

Atop each and every table DeBelzaq finds a partially
completed copy of THE BOOK OF SOLOMON

DEBELZAQ (CONTD)
There are scores of them

KAYLAN
Why
DEBELZAQ
There can be only one reason

(beat)
My Benedictine brothers intended
to spread the wisdom of Solomon
to all corners of the earth
that holy men everywhere might
arm themselves and join in the
battle against evil

From somewhere in the darkness ahead the Girls CHANT can
be heard Heads turn

INT THE AEDIFICUM - CONTINUOUS

Torches in hand LaVey and the others make their way through
the Scriptorium into a large ROTUNDA SHAPED LIBRARY

Its a dark cavernous space On the periphery barely visible
are rows and rows of bookshelves extending from floor to
ceiling The shelves of which are laden with scrolls and
parchments of all shape and size

A circular second floor balcony extends out over the main
floor High above the domed ceiling is capped with a portal
skylight A faint trace of moonlight filters through it

The Knights and DeBelzaq follow the CHANT They make their
way through the central area past the study tables and low
circular bookshelves

LAVEY
DeBelzaq The ritual

The priest takes his cue

DEBELZAQ
Durum est tibi velle resistere
Durum est tibi contra stimulum
calcitrdare

GIRL (0S)
Stinking scum

Suddenly from the balcony directly above them an entire
section of bookshelves rips free of the wall plows through
the railing and brings an avalanche of books toppling down
upon DeBelzaq and the others

LaVey and Felson leap to avoid being crushed by them

Kaylan grabs DeBelzaq by the back of the coat and wrenches
him out of harms way

The THUNDEROUS CRASH sends them stumbling to the ground

Centuries of dust erupt on impact with the floor filling the
rotunda with an eerie atmospheric haze

Lavey makes his way to Kaylan and DeBelzaq He helps the
priest to his feet Kaylan recovers his torch

Felson rejoins them And is the first to see it

FELSON
LaVey

LaVey turns Felson directs his attention to
THE SCRIPTORIUM

The tables are ablaze The copies of The Book of Solomon are
going up in flames

DEBELZAQ
The books We must save them

DeBelzaq starts toward the Scriptorium LaVey grabs the
priests arm and stops him

DEBELZAQ (CONTD)
What are you doing Unhand me

LaVey notices the Book of Solomon tucked under DeBelzaqs arm
He looks back to the burning volumes

LAVEY
(realizing)
Its the book

DEBELZAQ
What

LAVEY

Thats why he deceived us into
thinking the Girl was a witch
He knew a witch would be brought
to those who possessed the Book
of Solomon

(beat)
Its the book he wants

LaVey steps towards the Scriptorium straining to see through
the flames and smoke

FELSON
What is it

A feeling of dread washes over LaVey

LAVEY
Where are they

FELSON
Who

From behind DeBelzaq two gangrenous arms jut out of the
shadows

LAVEY
The monks

A monk’s sash stretched taunt between blue-black fists
wraps around DeBelzaq’s throat and wrenches him out of shot

Felson and Kaylan realize that the corpses of the dead monks
have all vanished

Instinctively the Knights whirl around to scan the darkness
surrounding them and see that DeBelzaq is gone

LAVEY (CONTD)
DeBelzaq

Torches in hand LaVey and Felson rush into the blackness in
search of the priest and come upon ONE of the UNDEAD MONKS
in the midst of strangling him

LaVey drops his torch two-hands his sword

LAVEY (CONTD)
Down

DeBelzaq tips his head as LaVey takes the Monk’s hood off
at the neck

But the body keeps strangling DeBelzaq Sonofabitch

LaVey’s next swing of the sword takes the monks arm sleeves
off at the elbows

Felson torches its robe and whats left of the monk goes
up in flames

LaVey hauls DeBelzaq to his feet The priest clutches for
the crucifix around his neck Its gone

Felson and Kaylan join LaVey to form a protective ring
around the priest Each holds a torch in one hand a weapon
in the other All straining to see into the darkness

LAVEY (CONTD)
(to DeBelzaq)
The ritual

DEBELZAQ
(reading)
Durum est tibi contra stimulum
calcitrdare

FROM HIGH OVERHEAD
Three points of light adrift in a predatory sea of darkness
DEBELZAQ (CONTD)
Quia quanto taérdius exis tanto
magis tibi supplicium crescit

(Note DeBelzag continues to read the ritual throughout scene)

FROM THE SHADOWS BELOW

They come

Felson catches the glint off the leather cutters before he
sees what’s wielding them He skewers the MONK in mid-air
and slams it to the ground pulls his blade out of its chest
and whirls to await the next

What he doesn’t see is the downed monk swing bolt-upright

back onto its feet like some macabre flesh and blood puppet
with a demonic force at its strings

Luckily Kaylan sees it He sweeps the monks legs out from
under it with his torch pulls a shelf of books down onto it
And sets them afire

Its all DeBelzaq can do to stay focused on reading the
ritual with all hell breaking loose around him

DEBELZAQ (CONTD)
Quia non hémines contémnis
Imperat tibi natus ex Virgine

LaVey back-thrusts his sword through a MONK closing fast from
behind He pins it to the side of a bookcase

Before he can draw his other sword a sash is cinched tight
around his neck lLaVey looks back over his shoulder swings
his torch up and into the grotesque face of his attacker

The monk spins away from the flame and into the pendulous
swing of Felsons sword The decapitated monk is staggered
momentarily then lunges at Felson

An arrow drives it back against a cabinet a second keeps it
there Relieved Felson whips a look to see Kaylan crossbow
in hand His appreciative look turns to alarm

FELSON
Behind you

Kaylan spins around ONE OF THE UNDEAD leaps at him
knocking him across one of the tables The torch flies
from his hand Kaylan rolls onto his back groping for
his crossbow He swings it up to see the robed figure
plunging a binder blade towards his heart

FWOOMP Felsons sword takes off the attackers knife hand
at the wrist Its stump pounds harmlessly into Kaylans
chest But its jagged rotting teeth go for his neck
Kaylan triggers the crossbow at point blank range The
first arrow lifts the monk off of him The second crucifies
it to a nearby pillar where it continues to thrash wildly

DEBELZAQ
Imperat tibi natus ex Virgine
Imperat tibi Jesus Nazarénus

Felson turns back to DeBelzag sees that hes about to be
blind-sided by ANOTHER OF THE MONKS

Felson grabs the priest and swings him out of its path The
monk stabs a binder blade into Felson’s back Felson flings
the monk over his shoulder It slams up against a study
table Felson plunges his sword through its chest and into
the table nailing it there Felson draws his other sword

Just as a monk is about to skewer LaVey from behind Kaylans
arrow pins its hooded head to the wall

LaVey spins around torches the ghastly thing its robe
goes up in flames

He turns away and into the blade of ANOTHER CADAVEROUS MONK
It slashes his forearm The torch flies from LaVeys hand
LaVey two-hands his sword and slices the attacker in half at
the sash

In a violent frenzy the ghastly thing in flames pulls
its hooded head off the arrow embedded in the wall He
wrenches the arrow free fists it and goes after Kaylan

Kaylans arrows pass right through the flaming monk

Kaylan drops the crossbow and reaches for his sword
Too late Its almost upon him when

WHAM LaVey broadsides the flaming monk with a rolling
ladder Driving it into some bookshelves that go up in
flames with the monk

ACROSS THE ROOM

Felson holds the last remaining torch DeBelzaq reads by
the light of it

DEBELZAQ (CONTD
Elisum atque prostratum exire
precépit ab hdémine

Out of nowhere come TWO MORE of the UNDEAD

Felson cuts one of them down The other buries a leather-
cutter in his chest Felson gasps as the air is sucked
from his lungs His attacker wields the leather cutter
over its head two-hands it to deliver the death blow

WHOOT Kaylan takes the top half of the monk off at the
chest He plunges his sword into its torso securing it
to the floor

A shocked DeBelzaq sees Felson stagger and go down

Kaylan turns back to see the torch fall from his hand

WHAM A MONK barrels into Kaylan takes him flying over
tables and disappearing from view

DeBelzaq rushes to Felsons side desperate to help him

Felson pushes him away Points to his torch on the floor
its flame still flickering

DeBelzaq drops to his knees beside the flame He sets the
unwieldy Book of Solomon down on the floor With his good
hand he picks up the torch and holds it over the book

The flame illuminates the Girl looming behind him

DEBELZAQ (CONTD)
(starts reading)
Qui te cum discipulos ejus
contémneres

A ruby red droplet fall to the page And another DeBelzaq
stops reading Realizes its BLOOD HIS

GIRL (0S)
I think youve said quite enough

DeBelzaqs eyes suddenly go wide with pain as hes hoisted
backwards into the air

CUT TO

LaVey battered and bloody manages to finish off THE LAST
OF THE MONKS He hears DeBelzaqs SCREAM

CUT TO
The Girls feet step over DeBelzags crumpled body
She bends down to pick up the Book of Solomon

A stream of water splashes upon her hands Burning them
The skin blisters

Across from her stands LaVey A flask of holy water in his
hand A sword in the other

LAVEY
All of this madness over a book

With a swipe of his sword he sends the book sliding across
the floor and out of reach

The Girl looks up to LaVey

For the first time since entering the Aedificum we see her
face and the effect the exorcism ritual was having on her
A cobweb of blue-black blood vessels throb just beneath the
surface of her skin Her eyes are bloodshot Her lips
blistered and cracked Blood trickles from her nose

GIRL
A book Ive searched from Aragon
to Jerusalem and back to find
(beat)
An accursed book that has interfered
with my work for far too long

She looks to the Scriptorium where the copies of the Book
of Solomon still burn

GIRL (CONTD)
The same book that those dedicated
servants of God breathed their
last breaths to copy
(beat)
A book No The book
The one whose pages hold the
balance

LAVEY
The “balance

GIRL
Come LaVey Surely you of all
people can attest to the good
and the evil that exists in man
(looking around at the
corpses of the monks)
They with their books wanted
to shift that balance

LAVEY
And you don’t

GIRL
No No I intend to destroy it
entirely
(beat)
And without the book all of
the crucifixes and holy water
in heaven won’t save you

LaVey makes a move to recover the book

With blinding speed the Girl lunges out and grabs him by the
throat Slaps the sword from his hand and hoists him up into
the air The flask of holy water falls to the floor and breaks

GIRL (CONTD)
And now Ive no further use for
you

She starts to strangle him LaVey tries to pry her hands
from his neck but shes far too strong

KAYLAN (0S)

Elisum atque prostratum exire
precépit ab hdémine

The Girl snaps a look into the shadows

GIRL
Is that you altar boy

Out steps Kaylan the Book of Solomon in his hands

GIRL (CONTD)
How disappointing I thought you
were dead

Aided by the light of the Scriptorium fire behind him Kaylan
continues reading

KAYLAN
Quo presénte cum te ab hdmine
separasset

The Girls body spasms as if an electrical charge were
running through her

GIRL
(pained)
Silence Damn you

The Girl squeezes tighter around LaVeys neck He gasps for
air

KAYLAN
LaVey

GIRL
Bring me the book and Ill let
him live
LAVEY
(choking)
Shes lying

GIRL
I said

She slams LaVey against one of the pillars He cries out
GIRL (CONTD)
Bring me the book Or Ill squeeze
the last breath from him

She tightens her grip around his neck

LAVEY
(to Kaylan)
Finish it
Kaylan forces his eyes back to the book
KAYLAN
Nec porcérum gregem ingredi
presumébas
The Girl slams LaVey against the pillar with even more
ferocity She puts the final squeeze on him crushing his
throat
Kaylan cant let her do it

KAYLAN (CONTD)
Stop

Kaylan lowers the book to his side
The Girl eases her grip on LaVey
Kaylan approaches the Girl Stops opposite her
GIRL
(extending her hand)
The book

Reluctantly Kaylan passes it to her
Suddenly the mortally wounded Felson comes stumbling out
of the shadows sword in hand and skewers the Girls
outstretched hand to the wall
THUNK The Girl HOWLS in pain

Felson drops to his knees His clothes soaked with his blood
He looks to Kaylan

FELSON
(through gritted teeth)
Finish it
He slumps against the wall

Kaylan looks up to find the Girl glaring at him all but
daring him to finish it

A defiant Kaylan reopens the sacred book and picks up where
he left off

KAYLAN
In nominee Patri qui domindtur
vivorum et mortuorum
Furious the Girl releases her stranglehold of LaVey

He falls to the floor choking and gasping for breath

A dying Felson looks to his friend LaVey sees him
A last look shared between them Felson dies

The Girl pulls Felson’s sword out of the wall freeing her
hand She wheels around to face Kaylan stalks after him

Kaylan backs away

KAYLAN (CONTD)
Qui venttirus est judicdre vivos

The Girl WRITHING SNARLING STAGGERING towards him

Kaylan backs into a pool of darkness He can no longer see
the words on the page

A dreadful silence He looks up from the book

The Girl smiles levels her sword for the kill and lunges
towards him

TIME SLOWS DOWN

LaVey hurtles into Kaylan knocking him out of the path of
the blade

Kaylan falls to the floor
THE GIRL RUNS LAVEY THROUGH
Kaylan hears his GASP and looks up

LaVey stands there the end of the blade protruding from
his back

Enraged the Girl looks at LaVey

His eyes meet hers

She feels his hands clasp her wrist
KAYLAN (0S) (CONTD)

Qui venttirus est judicdre vivos et
mortuos

A sense of dread ripples through her
LaVey smiles

She tries to pull the sword from his chest

LaVey holds on tightly to her wrist

It takes both hands for her to overpower him and free the sword
By then its too late

Kaylan finishes the prayer

KAYLAN (CONTD)
Et seculum per ignem Amen

The Girl looks to LaVey in horror and disbelief
The vanquished Devil gives an UNGODLY ROAR

The sword falls from her hand and through the floor that no
longer exists for the bodiless spirit from hell

The fires that burn share the same fate Their flames sucked
down into a hell far below as

The Devils desperate ROAR finally becomes the Girls
REAWAKENING CRY

She stands there before LaVey battered and bruised but alive
LaVey has an almost serene look of contentment on his face

For an odd moment the two of them seem to regard one another
(Its hauntingly reminiscent of the moment in LaVeys
nightmare in which the injured girl looks into the eyes of
the Knight who will decide her fate)

The Girls knees suddenly buckle and she falls to the ground
unconscious

LaVey collapsing to the floor
Kaylan rushes to his side

KAYLAN (CONTD)
(helpless )
LaVey What can I do How can I
help Tell me what to do Please
LaVey

LAVEY
(struggling to speak)
Theres nothing to be done
My time has come
(beat)
The future is in your hands

His eyes drift down to Kaylans side
LAVEYS POV

There clutched in his hand is The Book of Solomon

LaVeys eyes close
FADE TO BLACK
EXT A WIND SWEPT RIDGE - DAWN
Kaylan is burying LaVeys sword in the top of a grave mound
The second mound alongside his is Felsons
Nearby we see the Girl standing over a third mound (DeBelzaqs)
As Kaylan finishes she comes over with a bunch of wildflowers
in her hand She kneels and places them atop LaVeys grave
Says a prayer
When she’s done Kaylan helps her climb onto Felsons horse

She wipes a tear from her eye

KAYLAN
Are you alright

She nods
GIRL
I just don’t understand why
someone who didn’t even know me
would give his life for me

KAYLAN
It’s a long story

GIRL
I have time

She looks back to LaVey’s grave

GIRL (CONTD)
He gave it to me
She makes the sign of the cross
Kaylan mounts his horse

Protruding from one of the saddlebags we glimpse a corner
of the book whose GOLD LEAF PAGES we recognize

Together Kaylan and the Girl turn and ride off to begin
their long journey home

THE END
