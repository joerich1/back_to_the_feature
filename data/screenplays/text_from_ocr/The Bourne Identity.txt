it -- he goes on to claim that he
has just survived an assassination
attempt He says its us He says

No children are harmed

As the Professor rallies -- he will shoot Wombosi -- he
find Bournes jacket left on the floor (in which later
will find a clue leading him to Belleville) and last
hardly least he will take a parting shot at the bomb
sitting there on the throne

There will be a huge trailer-worthy explosion

HONCHOS

ABBOTT (0S)
The Treadstone project has actually
already been terminated It was
designed primarily as a sort of
advanced game program

ABBOTT in the hot seat ZORN right there beside him

ABBOTT
Wed hoped it might build into a
good training platform but quite
honestly for a strictly theoretical
exercise we thought it was far too
expensive The cost-benefit ratio
was just too high Its been all but
decommissioned at this point

MARSHALL
All right whats next

ZORN handing ABBOTT the next hundred pages
ABBOTT
Okay this is Blackbriar Blackbriar
is a joint DOD communications
program that we really feel has good
traction to it
ABBOTT is just gonna go on and on and on
