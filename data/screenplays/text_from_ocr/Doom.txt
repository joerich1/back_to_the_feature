DOOM

IN THE DARKNESS --

BOY’S VOICE
Where are we going

LOUIS GRIMM (VO)
On vacation

GIRL’S VOICE
In the middle of the night

FADE IN ON

EXT COUNTRY ROAD - NIGHT (10 YEARS AGO)

Not just dark but blustery too -- a snowstorm has kicked up
We see the headlights of an approaching MINIVAN And HEAR

LOUIS GRIMM (VO)
Weve been talking about it for
years White sandy beaches palm
trees warm tropical breezes --

BOYS VOICE
Did something happen at work

INT MINIVAN (MOVING) - NIGHT

The “BOY” is JOHN GRIMM 16 in back with his 18-year-old
sister SAMANTHA John is an athletic live-wire and affable
-wise-ass Sam is bright academic and dubious

MARY GRIMM
I thought you’d both be delighted to
get above ground Enjoy a little
sunshine get away from school

In front the parents MARY and LOUIS GRIMM two brilliant
scientists 40’s Tension and fatigue etched on their faces

SAM
Is something wrong with the “Ark”

The adults don’t answer

JOHN
Was there a problem on Olduvai
A pair of HEADLIGHTS appears in the rearview mirror lighting
up the van’s interior --

MARY GRIMM
Look it’s been very busy there’s a
lot going on with the company

LOUIS GRIMM
It’s complicated

Distracted Louis doesn’t notice the other vehicle is now
tailgating or else its lost traction control

LOUIS GRIMM (contd)
Well have a family meeting to talk
about it when we get there okay --
Johns gaze flicks to the rearview mirror for a beat and
then the WORLD EXPLODES in a STORM of GLASS and METAL
EXT RURAL ROAD - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)
Struck from behind by the PICK-UP TRUCK the van collapses
like an accordion as it pinwheels toward the bridge --
INT MINIVAN
John’s head SMASHES against his window blood spatters glass

The minivan comes to a VIOLENT STOP Mary flies forward
mashing her face and forearm against the dashboard

Sams ribs audibly SNAP under the pressure of her seatbelt

EXT BRIDGE - NIGHT

The vans spun halfway across halting only when it hits a
support column hangs precariously over the edge and then
silence for a long moment No one moves until finally --

LOUIS GRIMMS VOICE
(groans dazed)
No Sam John

Mary moans insensate Her nasal cartilage crushed Louis
tries to find his bearings can’t quite focus when --

Sam’s door is yanked open and someone pulls her from the van
Forcing the van to lurch horribly forward It tilts teeter-
totters for a moment suspended in time Then stops

John opens his eyes trying to focus Where are they
Watches as a single SNOWFLAKE strikes the windshield

And the van plunges into the dark river below

INT MINIVAN - IN THE RIVER

John desperately fumbles his seatbelt to free himself as the
water rushes up Louis escapes his begins work on Marys

Johns seatbelt releases He kicks wildly at the window that
was already spider-webbed by his bloody head No luck

Louis frees Mary but she doesn’t react she’s concussed eyes
glassy unfocused The middle of her face a purplish pulp

John swims about Then a hand on his shoulder his father’s
hand Louis pushes John’s face into a tiny air bubble John
purses his lips takes a breath tries to submerge himself
To save his dad instead of him But Louis is stronger
John’s father remains below him raising him up so he can
inhale the last gasp of air in the sinking vehicle

John struggles against Louis -- wanting more than anything to
sacrifice himself but his diminishing vigor fails him

John inhales the last available breath from the bubble as his
father’s limp hands fall away into the darkness below as we --

POUNDING FOOTSTEPS HEAVY BREATHING AS --
“Ten Years Later”

Appears then disappears as WE FIND OURSELVES in a darkened --

INT CORRIDOR - NIGHT

We’re in a vast underground lab somewhere Narrow lead-lined
dank tunnels dim lights and now from around a corner comes

DR TODD CARMACK -- terrified sprinting faster than any 60-
year-old Three more SCIENTISTS in smudged torn LAB COATS
Darkness at their heels They also run with unnatural speed
Carmack leads heading for a heavy door at the end of the
hall lit by a single flickering bulb Two others are right
behind One Scientist trails clutching his gut a cramp

The instant he slows his body is jerked sideways into the
shadows by a force unseen And then there were three

The footrace with Death resumes The doorway to deliverance
a hundred yards away Carmack pulling ahead of the pack

The Scientist now in the rear is steadily losing ground he
tries desperately to speed up He pumps his arms furiously
and when he’s jerked into darkness by those arms the sound
of a WET CRUNCH suggests they were torn from their sockets

Carmack reaches the door Paws at the control panel The
door slides open His last surviving colleague trailing

FEMALE SCIENTIST
Dr Carmack please

INT CARMACK’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Carmack squeezes through the narrow opening punches at the
interior control panel The steel door reverses direction

FEMALE SCIENTIST (0S)
Dr Carmack

Her arm shoots through the crack between door and wall Then
with a thick CLANK and even thicker CRUNCH the door SHUTS

Carmack takes a step back watching in horror as his former
coworker’s fingers spasm The digits turn blue then go
still and Carmack exhales deeply -- revolted but relieved

Then the whole arm rockets upward SMACKING into the ceiling
with immense force It then flies down SLAPPING the floor

Carmack stumbles back transfixed as the arm is wrenched up
and down The brief but fierce struggle abruptly ends as the
arm drops to the floor Carmack whirls to the vid-phone

CARMACK
This is Classified Research Olduvai
Request immediate instructions to
override protocol --
The rest is drowned out by a rotor’s THWACK as we

CUT TO
INT HELICOPTER - PRE-DAWN

Face to face in the wall-mounted jump seats an INTENSELY
ARMORED MILITARY UNIT GANNON THE DESTROYER stuffs extra
ammo in his Kevlar vest GOAT reads a well-thumbed Bible
HERNANDEZ trims his goatee with a combat knife THE KID a
nervous 19-year-old sits alone keeping to himself until
PORTMAN leans in

PORTMAN
You know Kid it’s funny Couple
weeks ago I tell Sarge I could use a
little pussy Next day he brings
you onto the team

SARGE (0S)
Portman

At the back of the chopper SERGEANT ASHER MAHONIN emerges
from the shadows Making his presence felt

PORTMAN
Sarge come on He looks like he
just got his first pube last week I
mean look at

From the shadows beside Sarge a hard saddened and familiar
face leans forward JOHN GRIMM now 26

JOHN
Don’t give me an excuse Portman No
one here will miss you

Portman flips John off as Sarge pulls a vid-disc from a
classified folder inserts it into a bulkhead console

SARGE
Listen up

A fuzzy IMAGE appears Carmack’s terrified transmission

CARMACK (ON VIDEO)
-- request immediate instructions to
override protocol and shut down the
Wormhole My lab is sealed off from
the general population we have a
Level Five Emergency

The transmission reverts to STATIC

SARGE
That came in twenty minutes ago
GOAT
You gonna forward the code to shut
down the Wormhole

SARGE
And strand a bunch of UAC personnel
halfway across the universe We
neutralize the threat and bring out
Carmack‘s team

John’s staring at the SNOW on the monitor Softly

JOHN
GrimmLabs

SARGE
Only way in

Sarge squeezes John’s shoulder then moves down the aisle
addressing his squad

SARGE (contd)
Alright You know the drill

The Kid (legal name STEPHEN DANTALIAN) grabs a pair of
HANDHELD SEMI-AUTOMATICS We HEAR

HERNANDEZ
I love the way this weapon says my
name If this weapon had a pair of
lips and set of tits Id marry it

They pass around a roll of MASKING TAPE and a PEN and
scribble their blood types on the bottom of their boots The
roll comes along to John the only team member who hasnt
“logged in” He is silent for a moment pensive

SARGE
How long’s it been

Sarge’s appeared again above John

JOHN
Ten years

SARGE

Sam still there
(John nods)

You up for this

JOHN
I don’t know if I can go back down
there Sarge

John habitually contemplatively runs his finger along an old
scar on his forehead as the helicopter begins its descent

SARGE
So stay with the chopper
(then)
But sooner or later you’re gonna
have to face your demons

John grips his weapon steels himself

In the distance a large field is lit up like a football
stadium in the middle absolutely nowhere It’s perimeter a
twenty foot wall topped with concertina wire

CUT TO

EXT FIELD - PRE-DAWN

The chopper has landed A couple hundred EMPLOYEES are lined
up to be led onto buses parked in the immense empty field
where the hell did all these people come from

They look as though they havent seen daylight in months
pale out of shape disoriented Carry a few quickly
gathered possessions in the frigid pre-dawn darkness The
employees watch with mild disinterest as the heavily armed
squad disembarks from the chopper

PORTMAN
I thought the shit was going down on
Olduvai

GOAT
Yeah

PORTMAN

So why’re these guys leaving

GOAT
Standard evac procedure for a Level
Five Emergency

Sarge leads his Marines toward a massive stainless steel
elevator that suddenly rises up out of a subterranean shaft
in the middle of what a moment ago was an empty field

SARGE
UAC doesn’t want us tripping over a
buncha civilians while we clean up
another one a their goddam messes

The Kid stops to stare -- Holy shit -- as the big steel
elevator doors open and we --

CUT INSIDE
INT ELEVATOR SHAFT- A MOMENT LATER

The men hustle aboard After a moment they begin their
descent into the earth A steel iris closes overhead
sealing the shaft

DESTROYER
Hey H What happened with that girl
Candace last night

HERNANDEZ
Oh dude she freaked when I tried to
give her the Dirty Hernandez

SARGE
Hernandez

HERNANDEZ
Right Sorry

Sarge taps a full cartridge against his helmet

SARGE
Pray For War

The team -- including John -- ritually responds

SQUAD
Pray For War

And BANG the elevator dead drops disappearing rapidly
beneath us into the seemingly bottomless abyss

CUT TO

INT GRIMMLABS (UNDERGROUND)

The elevator door opens and the Marines fan out into the now
empty lobby reception and security area of

The Louis and Mary Grimm Memorial Research Laboratory a
Division of Union Aerospace Corporation

e according to the large sign above the entrance

GOAT
Grimm Labs huh

JOHN
We used to just call it “the hole”

Beside the sign a pair of retouched idealized photos of the
two Drs Grimm and a dedication --

For their indispensable contribution to the study of our
origins as well as their warm caring hearts

GOAT
Good likeness

JOHN
«yeah

Long tunnel like hallways spread out in every direction with
complicated signs indicating distant rooms and far flung
research areas The squad’s met by a senior facility
Security Officer

SARGE
Any more transmissions from Olduvai

OFFICER
Carmack’s lab’s been quiet General
populations okay -- just nervous --

The Officer escorts the Squad into a white antiseptic-
looking tunnel The sign above says simply “The Ark”

SARGE
How many are up there all together

OFFICER
Fifty-four including the five staff
still locked down inside Carmack’s
classified lab

JOHN
You have a list of the personnel in
that lab

Sarge looks back at John unhappy with the interruption
OFFICER
Not down here but the Security team
on Olduvai’ll have it

They reach a plain grey wall The Guard punches an elaborate
code into a control panel The wall seems to somehow soften

HERNANDEZ
Oh no no no I don’t do nanowalls

PORTMAN
How can you not do nanowalls That’s
like saying “I don’t do food”

HERNANDEZ
No I do food I don’t do nano-food
and I definitely don’t do nanowalls --

Sarge SHOVES Hernandez through the nanowall into

INT ARK CHAMBER PREP AREA - CONTINUOUS
A tech (PINKY) greets the Team He couldn’t be more than 30
but his face is ruined features skewed in the wrong
directions He appears to be seated in an ELECTRIC
WHEELCHAIR A blanket covers his legs
PINKY
Good morning Gentlemen welcome to
the Ark My name is

JOHN
What the hell are you doing here

Pinky’s eyes narrow as he reads the stitching on John’s
jacket J Grimm Pinky gives a mirthless laugh

PINKY
I work here

John stares at Pinky Who slowly torturously cracks a
half-frozen twisted mutilated wholly sardonic smile --

FLASHBACK TO

CLOSE - PINKY’S FACE

Behind a shattered car window 10 years younger Unmarred
Till a fist SMASHES it through the window again and again

CUT BACK TO

INT ARK CHAMBER PREP AREA - CONTINUOUS
John worries his scar with a forefinger stares Pinky down
PINKY

Whoa they gave you a gun Did they
give you a psychological test first

SARGE
Now is not the time Reaper

PINKY
UAC was kind enough to offer me
gainful employment They felt bad
after what you did

SARGE
We got a job to do Let’s do it

Johns still staring at Pinky it’s unnerving

PINKY
Down here please

Pinky anxiously gestures the Squad to the base of a mirrored
cylinder protected by TWO SENTRIES

HERNANDEZ
We the first guys without a graduate
degree to go through this doohickey

SILENCE Hernandez puffs on his cig

DESTROYER
Ever notice how things get diverse
the minute some shit hits the fan

On the ring-shaped platform above the cylinder Pinky punches
data into various computer terminals around the ring

PHIL
Actually we’ve transported thousands
scientists technicians construction
teams janitors

PORTMAN
These names what’re all these names

He’s referring to a translucent plaque The names of a score
of men and women are engraved in a sort of scroll

PINKY

Ah That’s the Honor Roll of folks
who didn’t make it through intact
But that was before we perfected the
crystalline structure

(which reminds him)
Extinguish all smoking materials
before entering the containment area
Just one spark or cinder and --

HERNANDEZ
(stubbing out his cig)
Oh man

CUT TO

INT CONTAINMENT CYLINDER - MOMENTS LATER

The team now stands in a circle around the inner rim of the
cylinder eyes wide to a man They are all staring at

A DROP of LIQUID floating in the cylinder’s center Perfect
compact simple Light and space bend and twist around them

PINKY
Not what you expected

Destroyer shakes his head The sensitive soul inside the

built-up body is incredulous -- moved -- overwhelmed
DESTROYER
All this time picturing “the Ark” I
always assumed it was a -- ship I

mean a space-ship but not

JOHN
ee a Metaphor

The other squad-members appear both scared and dubious

PINKY
It’s nothing more nor less than a
quantum portal through the spacetime
continuum a wormhole a sort of
“cosmic shortcut” across galaxies

Off the squads looks (ranging through incredulity fear and
outright awe) Pinky pompously advances to the “droplet”

Pinky (contd)
I‘ll go first Watch how it’s done --

SARGE
Sorry First man through should be
shouldering a loaded weapon

Sarge seems to share a momentary look with Pinky then cocks
his gun and walks to the Wormhole Instantly it expands to
envelop his body in a glistening globular shell

And in a split-second FLASH OF BLUE LIGHT the Wormhole
condenses back to its original size -- and Sarge is GONE

CUT TO

INT “WORMHOLE CHAMBER” (OLDUVAI) - A MOMENT LATER

Sarge John the rest emerge from an identical “DROPLET” in
an area similar to -- the “Wormhole Chamber” we just left on
our home planet

As the team tries to shake off the debilitating sensations
Pinky rolls through from the other side seemingly
unaffected

PINKY
Dizziness and nausea are transitory --
we know of no long-term ill effects

There’s a large vault-like locked door leading out of the
chamber Beside it a bank of READ-OUTS for changes in air-
pressure temperature presence of pollutants andor
contaminants Sarge moves to it quickly

SARGE
Main facility appears to be
uncontaminated

Pinky unclips a key hanging from a chain around his neck
that strangely looks like only part of a key Turns to
Sarge

PINKY
I‘1l be waiting here for you when
youre ready to head back

JOHN
You better be

Sarge unclips a “part-key” from his own neck-chain He and
Pinky insert their keys into the door the massive hydraulic
lock pins SMASH back and the door slides open to reveal

INT ATRIUM (OLDUVAI) - CONTINUOUS
A sprawling complex with clean lines ambient MUSIC and high
ceilings illuminated to mimic sunlight on a bright spring

day As the squad heads into the facility

PORTMAN
Where the hell are we

Indeed they could be in the lobby of a Midwestern Marriott

GOAT
How about a couple million light
years from home

Destroyer feels the leaves of a potted tree fake

DESTROYER
And about a half-mile below ground

The mood is anything but sunny Agitated employees mill
about hoping to be allowed to get the hell out of here

SCIENTIST 1
Whats going on Are there
casualties in Dr Carmack’s lab

A tall thin and aggressive Scientist steps up to Sarge

SCIENTIST 2
Have we been exposed to some
contagion I have a newborn I --

An Olduvian Security Officer HUENGS intervenes

HUENGS
That’s what they’re here to find out
Dr Willits Excuse me --
(offers his hand)
Lt Huengs UAC security Dr
Carmack shut down his lab at 0337
this morning

Theyre on the move anxious personnel watching as they pass

HUENGS (contd)
After the initial transmission we
tried raising him on the internal com
system and on the optic data lines
but received no response

SARGE
You have surveillance cameras in
there any kind of monitoring or
listening devices

HUENGS
No sir It’s a classified area Our
job is to keep people out not watch
what they’re doing inside

SARGE
I want all non-essential personnel
secured in the Residential Zone and

out of our way

HUENGS
A lot of the staff is requesting
permission to evacuate back through

the wormhole

John searches the faces of the gathered personnel as the
Squad’s led across the atrium

SARGE
No Let’s figure out what were
dealing with first okay

JOHN
You got a list of names of the
personnel whore in Carmack’s lab

HUENGS
Sure

It’s on Huengs’ clipboard John grabs it anxiously runs his

finger down the columns

HUENGS (cont’d)
Thats all the personnel we’ve got up
here their work assignments are
listed beside their names

Behind him HEARS

WOMANS VOICE
Next page It’s alphabetical
John turns He -- and we -- see a pretty RESEARCHER
JOHN
Hey

RESEARCHER
“Hey” Thats it

JOHN
(smiles relieved)
You don’t work in Carmack’s lab

The two look pleased to see each

Obviously it’s been awhile
Before she can answer

other -- also embarrassed awkward
HERNANDEZ
Whoa

JOHN
This is my sister Samantha

HERNANDEZ
(D‘oh)
Oh Hello very nice to meet you

Rudely interrupted by an impatient

SARGE
Good to see you again Sam “My how
youve grown” and all that crap --

SAM
You too Asher Steroids

SARGE
Free weights And you can address me
as “Sergeant Mahonin” now Samantha

SAM
In which case you can address me as
“Dr Grimm” Sergeant

Touche
SARGE

Right I need you to go back to the
Residential Zone with everyone else

SAM
Actually no I’m going into the lab
with you --

SARGE

Hell you are

SAM
-- to download as much of the
research material as I can in case
the facility has to be sealed or
permanently evacuated

Crisply before Sarge can elaborate his objections

SAM (cont’d)
It’s UAC procedure and it’s my job

They’ve reached the outer door to the Classified Research”
lab area Two more UAC security guys are guarding the high
security door and entrance

SARGE
We were told there are five inside

HUENGS
Yeah We got lucky two hours later
there wouldve been eighteen Only
Carmack’s Genetics Team was working

Behind the Guard is a triple-deadbolted steel seal that looks
like a submarine pressure door

SARGE
What is this an air-lock

HUENGS
Rumor’s been Carmack’s experimenting
with Olduvian viruses

SAM
Thats all it is a rumor Viruses
are alive Olduvai is dead We
study fossils and minerals up here
skeletons rocks planetary geology

She pulls a “part-key” from her shirt Unclips hands it to
Sarge He inserts both keys and Lab Security inserts one

SARGE
You have a key

SAM
I’m one of the eighteen who would
have been inside two hours later

The heavy door swings open and the group enters

INT AIR LOCK - CONTINUOUS

A claustrophobic stainless steel cube Goat and Portman set
up their portable LAPT (Laser Airborne Particulate Tester)

SARGE
Haz-mats

Out of Destroyer’s duffel come a half-dozen form-fitting haz-
mat suits resembling lizard skins As the men pull them on

JOHN
Sam grab a suit

SAM
You guys notice this airlock has no
ultraviolet light or decon shower
It’s not used for biocontainment
because there is no --

SARGE
Maybe were looking at a disgruntled
employee with a big-ass gun The
Carmack group is into Advanced
Weapons RandD up here right Also the
Genetics Team and what else

SAM
There are four research labs
Genetics Weapons Pharmacology and
Archeological Spectrography

HERNANDEZ
Archeological what

Sarge accesses the inner door with his one key opening to

INT CENTRAL LAB (OLDUVAI) - CONTINUOUS
Pitch black Sarge locks the door behind them

SARGE
Can we get some juice goddammit

As gun-mounted light-beams sweep the darkness we glimpse

Computer servers charts maps tacked to walls display cases
of archeological findings But no scientists dead or alive

SARGE (cont’d)
Look alert ladies we’re in-country
now -- and this is a live patrol
All radios on Alpha weapons off
safety -- and don’t blink

John flicks on an overhead light Somehow illuminating this
shadowy secret space only makes the atmosphere even creepier

Portman waves a wand-shaped Sample Probe while Goat follows
consulting a spectrometer that registers real-time readings

GOAT
Magnesium chromium lead All
normal levels so far Sarge --

As cheerful as the outer facility was designed Carmack’s lab
is strictly utilitarian intentionally stripped of any detail
that might give a comforting sense of what goes on in here

GOAT (contd)
No evidence of airborne biological
agents infectious aerosols or
contaminated micro droplets no
TB rubella or streptococci

Sam throws John a look told you

HERNANDEZ
But major pucker factor huh

SARGE
OK Huddle up

The Team gathers around Sarge who via a handheld disc
projects a 3-D blueprint of Carmack’s lab into the center of
the floor a maze of rooms and halls

SARGE (cont’d)
We’1l begin on the periphery move in
pincer-style enclosing any potential
threat Gannon Kid sweep Zone One
Goat Portman Zone Two Hernandez
you and me will take the Armory make
sure those weapons are secure
Reaper you keep Big Sister safe

As everyone deploys
SARGE (contd)
Upload map to your HUDs fluorescent
powder marking as rooms are cleared

Each visor gives a soft green glow of the Carmack lab layout
as the Squad heads off

John and Sam are alone Awkward BEAT

SAM
So “Reaper”

JOHN
(embarrassed)
Because of our last name

SAM
I get it Sorry he made staying
with me sound like you drew latrine
duty or something

John brushes this aside

JOHN
How much time are you gonna need

SAM
Half an hour to download it all
maybe a little more

Inserting a data pod” she’s already downloading files
JOHN

When’d you start working in Carmack’s
secret lab

SAM
I told you I was working at Grimm
JOHN
You didn’t say anything about
Olduvai
SAM

You never asked I go in and out
No big deal And it’s “restricted” --
not “secret”

JOHN
Jesus Christ

On the wall the fossilized main display a perfectly
preserved HUMANOID SKELETON curled protectively around the
SKELETON of its CHILD Labeled “Olduvian female hominids”

SAM
Oh yeah Meet “Lucy”

JOHN
You found human remains on Olduvai

SAM
Humanoid Mom and Dad did Lucy and
her child was their last major find
We’re on Level Ten of the dig still
haven’t brought out samples nearly as
pristine intact

He had no idea takes a moment to try and process it

JOHN
You never said anything

SAM
Not something to scribble on the
yearly birthday card

JOHN
Look I know I haven’t been --

SAM

It’s all right I know how busy

youve been kicking ass with Sarge

and being all you can be

John doesn’t want to get into it Takes a beat then

JOHN

Did you hear Carmack’s message The

Man was genuinely freaked out
SAM

Well I don’t know what couldve

happened to him unless a heavy fossil
fell on his foot

She moves on to the next computer inserts another pod John
turns back to the “hominid” Stares at “Lucy” for a BEAT

SAM (contd)
What a waste

John turns to her she’s looking at him hard

JOHN
What’s a waste

SAM
You

INT ARMORY (OLDUVAI)

Sarge sweeps the first room as Hernandez moves into an inner
room finds racks of neatly stacked weapons

HERNANDEZ
Doesnt look like anythings missing

Hernandez’s light finds a rack of ancient guns

HERNANDEZ (contd)
Hey Sarge

Sarge steps in to find Hernandez admiring a vintage gun

HERNANDEZ (cont’d)
Looks like the first-gen model of our
plasma cannons huh

Sarge notes an unmarked secure door at the far end

THE KID (contd)
Sorry just -- get a little jittery

DESTROYER

And ammo

He pats the greenie’s shoulder reassures

DESTROYER (contd)

INT CIRCULAR HOLDING CELL

Goat and Portman hug the walls of a round room that’s mostly
a big pit Curious they shine their lights into its depths

Twenty feet down walls lined with smooth heavy steel

GOAT
This is a holding cell

His ears pick up a faint HUMMING sound

PORTMAN
Yeah Why do you think --

Goat squats Peers at the pit’s surface the rough gouges in
the metal leading up to the rim Portman squats beside him
reaches his hand out to touch the inside surface of the pit --
CRACK A JOLT of electricity throws Portman back against the
wall As Goat turns to “xX” the room with his fluorescent
marker

GOAT
I think it’s a holding cell because
the walls are electrified

Portman frantically blows on his singed hand

PORTMAN
You knew that and you still let me
touch it
(Goat smirks)
Goddammit Goat

CUT TO

INT CENTRAL LABORATORY

As Sam fills another data pod John is drawn to a light box
sunk in the wall The bluish read-out shows a massive grid

and the header reads Thermal Ionization Mass Spectroscopy

JOHN
This is a radioscopic map of the
ground under us All these lines

SAM
Where buildings used to be we think

JOHN
There was a city here
(then softly spooked)
Something wiped these people out

SAM
That’s one theory Which would have
more credence if we had any sense of
what might have “wiped” them “out”

JOHN
There another theory

SAM
Maybe they just -- went with time

John turns back to Lucy Notes her protective posture

JOHN
You don’t shield your baby from time

Sam resumes her work Off a monitor below Lucy’s display
JOHN (contd)

Sam Don’t humans have twenty-two
chromosomes plus the sex chromosome

Off Sam’s murmur of assent

JOHN (cont’d)
Lucy had twenty-four

On the monitor CHROMOSOME MAPS that look like straws filled
at various points with alternating black and white strata

SAM
All these years you could’ve been
squinting into a microscope instead
of a night vision sniper scope

Ignoring the unsolicited analysis and advice

JOHN
What’s the 24th Chromosome for

SAM

Were not sure It’s got only one
layer of genetic material we suspect
it may be synthetic Bio-engineered
No one’s been able to identify ten
percent of the human genome There’s
plenty of room in the helix to insert
stealth DNA

JOHN
So we have no idea what chromosome 24
does

SAM

The Olduvians knew That’s what
Carmack’s team’s been working on

Pumped The Kid barely HEARS over his ear-splitting barrage
Panting John catches up then pushes past forcing the Kid to
hold his fire as John chases the thing around a corner and
into a DARKENED DEAD END

John inches forward keenly aware of the THICK BREATHING
emanating from the shadows

JOHN
If you have a weapon drop it

THUMP too loud for a dropped gun more like a dropped body
As Kid and Destroyer fall in behind him John takes a deep
breath and turns on his gun-mounted FLASHLIGHT pointing the
blinding light right into the eyes of

The Demon’s turned it’s attention to Sam It allows
Hernandez to roll over grab his weapon and fire a hurried
shot The demon SCREAMS falls backward

Hernandez jumps to his feet takes off toward the Infirmary
as fast as he can run

But with terrifying recovery speed the Demon is back in
action on his heels and gaining slicing the air with its
massive claws --

At the end of the hallway Sam stands on the other side of
the open nanowall hands on the control panel

SAM
Come on Come on

Hernandez sprints with all he’s got

HERNANDEZ
Now Do it now

With fading strength he leaps head-first The Demon follows
suit a split-second behind Hernandez as

Sam activates the panel Hernandez tumbles through

Next come the Demon’s head upper torso -- then the nanowall
solidifies It SCREAMS as its bones CRACK within the wall

Enraged its tongue spools out just shy of Hernandez’s neck

The Baron wounded yet seemingly none the worse for wear
plows full speed through wall after wall of see-through metal

With only several feet and one glass wall to go the Squad

All is quiet And then with no warning and at frightening
speed Destroyer is YANKED VIOLENTLY into the darkness of --

AN ADJOINING CORRIDOR

He lands with a thud opens his eyes to find himself staring
at a wide-open salivating mouth with monstrous teeth

Destroyer instantly reacts rolling away from the wet maw
then in the same motion delivering a mighty kick to the
Baron’s thick thigh shocking the beast’s femoral artery

As the Baron topples it swats off Destroyer’s helmet which
smashes against the wall Unable to radio the squad for
help Destroyer grabs the busted chain from the demon’s
MANACLE in an attempt to drag the beast back into the Lab

He gets all of two feet before the Baron ROARS and swings its
leg mightily flinging Destroyer all the way down the
corridor and into --

Where Destroyer tumbles into the darkened pit Destroyer
struggles to his feet backs into the one shaft of light
coming down from above Looks at the 20 foot walls of the
pit considering his options when the sound of something HUGE
landing in the darkness beside him spins him around

Destroyer peers into the darkness Can barely make out the
Baron’s DRIPPING FANGS Destroyer cracks his knuckles

DESTROYER
I see we speak the same language

Then he and the Baron proceed to beat the shit out of each
other It’s not fluid choreographed or beautiful but a
knock-down drag-out fight between physically dominant foes

Destroyer rushes the darkness throws himself headfirst into

Both combatants are weakened but Destroyer clearly more so
He squints trying to find the Baron in the darkness

ROAR The Baron rushes from the darkness knocks him back
into the wall ZAP Destroyer struggles upright The Baron
wallops him again and flings him into the shadows

Destroyer reels weakened and helpless He collapses
managing to avoid hitting the far wall by mere inches For a
split second he catches sight of the Baron leaving the lit
portion of the cell sliding back into night

Now Destroyer is blind lost in the darkness and the Baron
is somewhere in here with him A much too long moment of
silence then

The CLANK of a chain and Destroyer is rammed flying back
first into the wall but holding on to the Baron as he does
so And this time he holds himself there the electricity
coursing through his body and into the Baron’s Only SPARKS

The Baron shrieks It twists and turns with unholy strength
but Destroyer holds steady his fingers digging into the
Baron’s back

It’s now 005 hrs and the “subject” seems to be writhing
mostly out of frame We watch the arm metamorphose from
something human and fleshy to a scaly hardness

HERNANDEZ
Who lied

SAM
Carmack told us he wouldn’t attempt
to reconstruct the Olduvian genetic

Sam angrily snaps OFF the video and looks to Hernandez
Finds him WHITE AS A SHEET staring at something OS She
follows his gaze --

They are looking through the observation room window On the
other side of the window is Goat

Sort of
Hes changing turning but still recognizable

Oh my God

Goats looking out at them but his eyes are hollow He

Hernandez and Sam recoil in terror as Goat REELS back SLAMS
his head back into the glass a second time His eyes wide

As Sam moves examines the Baron’s remains

SAM
I think Carmack was experimenting
with the 24th chromosome he found in
Lucy Extracted it reproduced it
and used Stahl as a guinea pig It
enters the bloodstream bonds with
stealth DNA then takes over the
entire cellular structure

THE KID
Why are they all turning out so
different

SAM
It must be that the anomaly isn’t the
chromosome it must be something in
the host
(how to put this)
It seems to turn the host inside out
and

Hernandez looks up from Destroyer’s body

HERNANDEZ
-humans are monsters inside

Sam is quickly discreetly (via nasal cavities) taking brain
tissue samples from Destroyers body

SAM
Carmack mustve been infected when we
found him The wound on his neck we
lost sight of it after the ear thing
it’s probably the transmission site

Hernandez reacts But stays mum as Sam agrees

SAM (cont’d)
He was already changing Evolving --
among other things -- a better tongue

to pass the chromosome to new hosts
Starting with the thing in the sewer
that attacked Goat -- Dr Willits

It starts to fall into place

JOHN
We found several people in the lab
theyd been slaughtered rather than
infected Why doesn’t it try to
infect everyone

I don’t know Some like Gannon are
killed outright While others like
Goat are transformed into -- demons

John gets his breath back regains his bearings Sees Sam
splayed on the floor -- stunned but uninjured And

Hernandez struggling upright -- the two-foot metal leg from
the examination table sticking through his shoulder Dazed

HERNANDEZ
Sorry I let it get away

JOHN
Yeah well I’m sorry you have a metal
bar stuck through your shoulder

Sam crosses to Hernandez kneels

SAM
Hernandez lie down let me help you

Hernandez surprises Sam and himself with a kiss on her lips

HERNANDEZ
Thanks but not right now Right now
I’m gonna tear that demon four new
assholes and fuck every one of them

CUT TO

INT TUNNEL - A MOMENT LATER

Having disposed of Pinky in the interim The Arch-Vile crawls
down a corridor Pauses at an intersection of hallways

Watched by Sarge and the Kid concealed behind a pipe Sotto
as the Arch-Vile seems to be deciding which way to go

SARGE
Let’s drive it west toward the
nanowall trap it there then --

Before he can finish The Kid breaks cover and with a courage
bordering on crazy chases the Arch-Vile west --

SARGE (cont’d)
Jesus Kid

The kid drops to one knee gets a bead --
WEAPON ID
Ammunition stores exhausted All
magazines empty

THE KID
shit

Sarge leaps into place beside him aims But the Arch-Vile
sees him aim turns and runs --

-- Light through the nanowall

SARGE
What the hell

Sarge glances at the nanowall control panel At its blinking
display TIMED RELEASE EXECUTED NANOWALL IS OPEN

THE KID
What’s happening

SARGE
KidRetreat

THE KID
What

But off Sarge’s silent purposeful backward-march the Kid
follows suit eyes glued to the softened nanowall as he
reloads -- and only then does he hear the inexplicable
otherworldly CHATTERING emanating from the other side

THE KID (cont‘d)
What IS that

SARGE
Field of fire

The two men pause just long enough to loose a DEAFENING
BARRAGE then turn and run like hell all the way down to

INT CIRCULAR ANTEROOM

At tunnel’s end Bolt the reinforced door as they find
Hernandez just arriving

HERNANDEZ
What the hell is going on

THE KID
I’m too old for this shit

They stand in the center of the room weapons all aimed at
the door Ready for whatever comes through

Sarge stiffens as an arm locks around his neck from behind
and the serrated blade of a knife presses on his throat

JOHN
What was in it for you

SARGE
A hot meal and a hand-job Whatre
you blathering about now John-Boy

John tightens his grip

JOHN
What did they promise you Money
A promotion For helping kill our
parents and keeping quiet about it

Sam steps out of the shadows of the tunnel behind John
Stares at Sarge with unrestrained fury A loud jarring BANG
on the door makes John turn --

-- and in the instant John loses concentration Sarge does a
smooth martial arts move that dislodges him -- flings John
down onto the floor Sarge plants a boot on his protege’s
chest He looks down at John Warns

SARGE
When we’re out of the deep dark shit
Well hash this out But not till
then You got that Reaper

John grips Sarge’s boot moves it off his chest stands
Turns his attention to the door as it starts to buckle
against the relentless demon assault

SARGE (contd)
I have some work to do Anyone not
with me take cover NOW
Sarge takes a deep breath steadies his aim then --

HERNANDEZ
Oh man

They turn to Hernandez he stands in the center of the room
staring at his feet Distraught

With reason He’s standing on a grate and two hideous arms
have reached up through it grabbing him by the ankles

SAM
(horror-struck)
HernandezGregg -- hold still

Hernandez smiles -- unfathomably brave resigned as a Hindu
saint -- as one of his feet is pulled through the grate

HERNANDEZ
Cant
(then)
Take care of Sam you guys okay

And the rest of him goes down as though through a strainer
His rapid descent halted briefly when the table leg lodged in
his chest catches on the grate and the helpless group gets a
much-longer-than-necessary look at the dying man With one
final horrifyingly violent tug the table leg bends and
Hernandez is gone

Sam jams a fist in her mouth only half-stifling her SCREAM

THE KID
Were all gonna die here

Sarge hefts the BFG as he turns determined to the door

SARGE
Then let’s goddamn go

But inexplicably Sarge stops Goes silent Then a GURGLE
Then pink foam bubbling up from Sarge’s throat and cascading

down the front of his uniform Where it matches a spreading
stain that rings a razor-sharp object jutting from his belly

And from behind Sarge’s back it lowersFROM THE CEILING

The SPIDER SKULLETON a gigantic inverted DEMON SKULL with
enormous SPIDER-LEGS spouting from it A Volkswagon-sized
spider with an upside-down skull where its body should be

John shields Sam behind him taking aim
The Kids face glazes The killer in him rising once more

Sarge looks down infinitely surprised to find himself
skewered by the Spider Skulleton’s serrated leg

SARGE (cont’‘d)
But I’m not supposed to die yet

The Spider Skulleton flicks his leg flinging Sarge aside
like a rag doll

John is about to start blasting but hesitates when he spots
the human blur coming at the creature from across the room

JOHN
Stephen no

The Kid slides along his back both guns blazing He unloads
two full pistols into its underbelly steaming ENTRAILS
spilling out onto him until

SCHWING Two of the Skulleton’s legs ROCKET downward goring
the Kid through each shoulder He howls in agony as the
Skulleton lifts him into the air brings him only inches from
its foul face

John tries to line up the kill shot but can’t The Kid is
too close dangling helplessly

THE KID
John what’re you waiting for --

Next the creature’s tongue unspools wraps around The Kids
neck and pumps Chromosome 24 directly in the carotid artery

SAM
(near tears)
Johnyou have to do something

John torn looks up to see the Kid struggling to stay
conscious looking at him Those sad eyes

SAM (contd)
Stephen hold still

Though panicked The Kid processes what’s just happened to
him Suddenly it becomes very clear what must be done

THE KID
(begs John)
Shoot us both before I --

JOHN
No goddamn way -- gimme a sec --

The Kid points his own gun at the roof of his mouth

SAM
No --

THE KID
Saving ammo Two-for-one I know
what’s inside me

He FIRES the bullet blowing open the other side of his skull
then BLASTING straight up into the Spider Skulleton
liquefying its brain stem It’s limp body along with The
Kid’s comes CRASHING to the floor in a broken heap

John and Sam take in the terrible spectacle with tragic awe
Then John ventures wary into the Tunnel

JOHN
--Sarge

No answer unsurprisingly Off the silence we HEAR OVER

SAM’S VOICE
The Olduvians mapped the human genome
and discovered the basic building
blocks of life And then they tried
to manipulate them --

CUT TO

INT SCIENCE LAB

Theyve brought Kids body back here Sam stands at the sink
scrubbing off demon gore John reloads his guns from the
collected ammo belts of his fallen comrades

SAM
«eto build a Better Man or a
deadlier soldier either way it went
terribly wrong A few of them must
have seen the writing on the wall and
escaped through the Wormhole

JOHN
The “Ark

Sam shuts off the tap Turns from the sink to John

SAM
Maybe were all descendents of those
few Olduvaians the ones who escaped
(beat)
Adam and Eve Noah’s Ark

Sam begins searching for medical equipment

JOHN
There would be records of their
coming writings history

SAM
They wouldn’t have wanted to take
much with them They’d learned their
lessons this planet was a chance to
start anew

JOHN
Goat called the Bible “man’s first
stories Man’s birth stories”
Allegories warnings not to play God
to not repeat past mistakes

She continues ransacking cabinets

SAM
Why do they attack some people and
not others What are they looking
for in a host

(an then)

Why Goat and not Gannon Why Carmack
and not Destroyer There’s an
alternative Lucy’s the proof

(MORE )

SAM (contd)
She carried Chromosome 24 but she
died protecting her child not
devouring it

JOHN
Maybe it has to destroy some people
because it knows something about what
will happen if they’re infected

She’s found surgical kits and drapes spinal kits

SAM
The ten percent the unidentified
stealth DNA when it was first
discovered some scientist’s thought
it might be the genetic blueprint of
the soul

Swipes a research bench clear with her arm sending equipment
flying Dumps her gathered supplies onto it

SAM (cont’d)
John we can beat this I’m not
saying Im perfect I’m human and
any soul is complex a mystery --

JOHN
(realizing)
Nono

SAM
We’re not like the animals Carmack
tested first Mice aren’t good or
evil just instinctive

John realizes where this is going

JOHN
No Sam --

SAM
I have to try We have to know
(off his look)
If we don’t do anything we die

She hands him a pair of surgical gloves then moves toward the
Baron’s remains but he blocks her way

JOHN
I’m not going to let you inject some
poisonous goddamn chromosome into
your body --

SAM
I can observe the processes as they
occur Monitor and record it If I
don’t survive send the data outside
for some else to analyze

JOHN
No

SAM
They’re going to need to study the
cellular transitions The demons
will find us soon there isn’t time
to argue

JOHN
No
(and then)
It should be me

Stunned Sam blinks at her brother

JOHN (cont’d)
Im no saint I’ve done some things
You can’t imagine But it can’t be
you youve got to be able to observe
it You can’t observe it if it’s
killing you It has to be me

John unholsters his gun hands it to the reluctant Sam
JOHN (contd)
One through my heart one through my
head if it if I’m not --
Sam refuses the gun
SAM
I wont need it
(then)
I know who my brother is

FADE TO

EXTREME CLOSE ON THE BARON’S TONGUE

HEAVING as a pair of gloved hands grasp it PULL it from its
residence in the Baron’s chest

FADE TO

EXTREME CLOSE ON JOHN’S BACK

Shrugging the uniform from his shoulders Exposing battered
muscularity

FADE TO

EXTREME CLOSE ON THE BARON’S TONGUE

Being SKEWERED by a horizontal steel bar It dangles from
the bar dribbling genetic matter

FADE TO

EXTREME CLOSE ON A THICK NEEDLE

Pushing in between two of the vertebrae of John’s lower back
until its entire length has been swallowed

PULL OUT to show that we are in --

INT THE SCIENCE LAB

Where John lies stomach down on a stretcher The spinal
tap leads from his lower back to a clear PLASTIC TUBE which
itself coils upward and hangs from The Baron’s TONGUE

Sam pinches the tube keeping the clear fluid collecting off
the tongue from coursing into John’s spine She’s surrounded
him with diagnostic equipment to monitor his progress

SAM
When this is over Can we go on that
vacation we thought we were taking
ten years ago

JOHN
White sandy beach and warm tropical
breezes -- I promise Sam

Sam smiles at her brother maybe for the last time and then
releases the IV valve John winces as we

ZOOM IN to the IV bag all the way to the molecular level
where we go CLOSE ON A STRAND OF DNAC-24 We follow this
rogue chromosome as it suddenly flows through the clear tube
the syringe and into JOHNS SPINE where it BONDS to his own
DNAand then the replication begins

We commence a whirlwind ride through his body each
physiological system changing as we pass it Taking in C-24
BLASTING through the spinal column speeding through
arteries the heart the carotid the brain stem through the
foramen magnum into the medulla oblongata the cerebellum
the cerebral cortex the optic nerve the retina cones
rods lens pupil and then it’s black and we

FADE UP ON

INT SCIENCE LAB - 15 MINUTES LATER
John’s eyes groggily open He takes a moment to reorient
Sits up on the table facing that mirror over the sink

He looks the same Almost Yes something’s changed As

John raises a finger to his forehead -- his smooth forehead
JOHN
Sam My scar it’s -- gone

He turns for her reaction But Sams not here

And the Infirmary is a wreck medical supplies strewn tables
upended chairs smashed against the wall Sam was taken from
here by force And she definitely didn’t go without a fight

As he frenziedly digs amid the debris for his weapons ammo

JOHN (contd)
Goddammit Sam SAM

He gathers up his guns where they were flung -- then armed
for the Apocalypse SLAMS home the clip to his pistol He
turns to face us with burning eyes

Were in a LOW ANGLE When John takes a step forward

WE ZOOM IN through the sole of his foot thus commencing a
whirlwind ride within his body speeding through arteries
weaving between tibia and fibula blasting through the spinal
column more arteries the heart the carotid the brain
stem through the foramen magnum into the medulla oblongata
the cerebellum the cerebral cortex the optic nerve the
retina cones rods lens pupil and just that FAST we are

Living the moment we’ve been waiting for The moment we
become JOHN GRIMM Now we are the FIRST PERSON SHOOTER

I weave through the darkened corridors

A SCREECH from a hallway to the left I SPIN stand at the
ready with my weapon aimed Something is RUNNING toward me

Only with several feet left between us can I finally see it
A half-turned ZOMBIE

It’s upon me before it even realizes I’m there I DOUBLE-TAP
dead center of its chest and it FLIES BACK disappearing into
the dark from whence it came

I proceed and find it twenty feet down the tunnel near
death I shoot it in the head as I pass I don’t slow down

A SOUND from another side corridor I SPIN gun trained
Nothing Am I hearing things Have I gone cr--

A hideous HOWL so close it sounds like it’s inside my head
I crouch spin Standing above me having materialized from
the direction I was heading is an obscene FEMININE DEMON
Its viscous venomous spittle SPATTERING my visor I WIPE MY
HAND ACROSS MY VISOR

I jam my gun under its chin BLAM As I walk past I hear a
SCUTTLING I SPIN blast apart its DISEMBODIED TONGUE which
writhes on the floor

GROAN SPIN AGAIN blast apart another zombie Into a room
Shadow in the corner DUCK BEHIND A PILLAR blow away
another zombie

CHATTERING from the far doorway Blackness beyond

I reach into my belt withdraw a flare I snap it toss it
into the darkness HISSING of the flare somewhere in the
tunnel ahead Then it lights

For a millisecond the tunnel floods with a RED BURST I see
the flare ahead Behind it a DOZEN ZOMBIES peering from
the dark BABBLING nightmarishly But only for a millisecond

-- then the flare DIES PITCH BLACK

A zombie SHRIEKS I fire blind SPRAYING the entire hallway
with an arc of lead I hear only SCREAMS

When again I see them by the light of my muzzle flare there
are only several left But they continue crawling over the
bodies fallen in front of them

WEAPON ID
Low -- ammo -- warning

I pivot drop down pump the LAST SHOTS into a wall-mounted
fire-extinguisher It blows like a BOMB resultant shrapnel
mowing down all but one of them Our old friend THE ARCH-
VILE

I SPIN INTO A HALLWAY and run The Arch-Vile is fastI can
hear it catching up Sprinting Light plays off the wall
I catch glimpse of my own shadow Hoisting a new WEAPON

Theres a hallway coming up on my right I speed up Leap
Plant my left foot on the wall -- then spring off launch
myself into the hall FIRING all the way

The Arch-Vile turns the corner and catches my lead as I fly
back I land on my back continue FIRING until I’ve mowed
off several of the Arch-Vile’s vestigial arms And then my
rifle runs out of ammo

The Arch-Vile looks at itself at the SMOKING BULLET HOLES in
its abdominothorax It snarls at me I look to the timed
mine I dropped during my leap The one it’s standing right
above I SHIELD MY EYES FROM THE BLAST

I stand heart racing Head back down the tunnel with plasma
cannons in hand The dark tunnels are eerily silent Empty

Fork in the route About to take one on the right when
muffled

SAMS VOICE
John

My sister I SPIN hustle down the other corridor toward
the voice The hallway leads to a big room filled with work
benches and discarded hardware On the far side a doorway

I’m almost to the door but a sound captures my attention A
CHUNKY MECHANICAL WHIR From the corner

I know that sound it’s so familiar I follow and resting
on a bench in the middle of the clutter there it is

Pinkys wheelchair Hanging upside-down over the edge of a
workbench Engine HUMMING wheels SPINNING Odd but of no
use to me I turn to exit Which is when I hear a SNORT

I turn back -- and watch in horror as two meaty forelegs drop
from under the wheelchair The legs drop to the ground get
a foothold and pull forward And the rest of the wheelchair
comes with it

Before me now stands a hideous boar-like demon but closer to
the size of a rhino than a pig And where its hindquarters
should be its leathery flesh is bonded to the wheelchair

This is PINKY DEMON And it recognizes me

Before I can react a plume of steam BLASTS from the chair --
and Pinky Demon charges me Butts me in the gut with a ROAR

I stumble back through machinery that tangles up my arms and
slices at my skin I scramble to my feet look up to see his
lowered head inches from mine Everything goes BLACK

I come to moments later aware of a SMACKING SOUND Hazy I
look down around my feet Where is that goddamn thing --

CRUNCH Right beside my head I crane my head to see Pinky
tear away half my deltoid Pinky is EATING ME

I reach blindly with my right arm grab a metal pipe Watch
as Pinky devours my torn-away flesh wait patiently for him
to take another mouthful of my shoulder My heart POUNDS as

Pinky SWALLOWS my muscle opens his dripping maw -- and I
jam the pipe into his mouth and roll away Pinky HOWLS
tears around the room in a wild attempt to free his jaws

His wheels spin sending him into a bizarre wheelie I jump
to my feet search for something to use in self-defense

I decide on the CHAINSAW over there I yank the chain and it
ROARS to life Pinky’s heard the chainsaw and ceased his
manic destruction of the room Now he idles front and
center staring me down I REV the chainsaw

In response Pinky forces his jaws very wide apart -- then he
CHOMPS down sending the pipe through his upper jaw and right
out the top of its snout He charges

The chainsaw though ferocious is unwieldy hard to handle
in close quarters combat Pinky butts me knocks me back I
swipe at him SAW in half the pipe protruding from his face

Pinky ROARS SNAPS at my legs I strafe left tear a massive
gash in Pinkys muscular shoulder He SCREAMS leaps at me
His front legs catch me in the chest before I can bring the
chainsaw back up and I crash to the ground

Pinky bounds off smart enough to stay moving I get to my
feet before he BUTTS me again My chainsaw skitters away

Pinky TEARS away a portion of my calf Breathing hard I
grab a sledgehammer and CRACK his skull send him tumbling

I stand and knowing this is my last chance make a dash for
the still-running chainsaw I scoop it up with one hand and
spin at the same time just as Pinky hurtles toward me

I swipe at him in mid-air connect -- and send Pinky
plummeting along with the chainsaw to the ground

Pinky rights himself sets his feet andcan’t move He
looks around confused Steam billows from a deep fissure in
the mechanics of the chair Ive severed the neuro-mechanic
connection between machine and monster A pathetic sight

I fetch a plasma cannon from the corner of the room Return
to Pinky’s side I take a moment to look down at this
creature to process this as the end of our ten years of
pain Then I END IT

I hurry to the far door and into a scene of incredible
carnage The elevator’s protective sheath is smashed clawed
and chewed upon To either side is a pile of dead demons
Huge MELTED HOLES in the walls GREEN PLASMA dripping from
them and from the bodies below them

Above me a fluorescent bulb FLICKERS and we

MATCH CUT TO

INT ELEVATOR ROOM - CONTINUOUS

A fluorescent bulb FLICKERS above as John squints into the
strobing gloom He can make out a world of destruction and
then slowly in addition to the MAN who’s poised at the
door to the elevator he sees a WOMAN propped in a corner

JOHN
Sam

John crosses to Sam’s side She’s battered and bruised her
clothes torn and bloodied She peers up at him and weakly

SAM
The demons came -- for us I led them
away from you

JOHN
Don’t talk -- please rest --

Interrupted by a harsh LAUGH from Sarge Whos got both
elevator keys now and has just inserted the first one

SARGE
“Rest” She needs medical attention

As John turns from Sam to Sarge then back

SAM
Sarge saved me
JOHN
Saved you Or your key
Sam doesn’t answer -- her eyes close she slumps down
SARGE

She needs help Weve got to get her
up to the surface

John holds out his open palm

JOHN
Give me her key
SARGE
Didnt you hear The demons are all

dead

Another step closer John can start to make out Sarge’s face
Sees that Sarge’s forehead is swelling his jaw thickening

JOHN
All but one

He raises his plasma gun points it at Sarge’s forehead
SARGE
It won’t work John Killing for
peace is like fucking for chastity

Sarge turns back to the door starts to insert Sams key

SARGE (contd)
I tried to be like a father to you

Gambling on John’s compassion Sarge unlocks the door

JOHN
You murdered my father My mother

SARGE
We’re all murderers here right
You me Goat and Gannon that’s what
they pay us for

John’s got way too much blood on his uniform to refute this
outright So the two -- devil and angel - are locked ina
stare-down Sarge’s eyes glow dim RED John’s have a thin
glimmering WHITE RING around the iris Almost a halo

SARGE (cont‘d)
John Listen to me Your parents
were gonna go public

FLASHBACK TO

INT MINIVAN (SUBMERGED) - NIGHT (10 YEARS AGO)

John struggles against Louis -- wanting more than anything to
sacrifice himself but his diminishing vigor fails him OVER

SARGES VOICE
Violate their security agreements

John inhales the last available breath from the bubble as his
father’s limp hands fall away into the darkness below

SARGE’S VOICE (contd)
Endanger Carmack’s research

John grabs for his father’s hands struggles against fate to
hold them but comes up only with Louis’s wedding ring

SARGE’S VOICE (cont’d)
The entire Olduvaian project

A pane SHATTERS Sarge’s dived down he thrusts his hands
through the open window grabs a hank of John’s hair pulls

EXT RIVERBANK - NIGHT

With ebbing strength Sarge heaves John onto the bank John
looks back down into the water Can just make out the
shadows of his parents submerged trapped in the minivan

SARGES VOICE
Your parents stood in the way not
just of profit but of progress
They couldn’t be allowed to do that

Though hypothermic and half-drowned John tries to dive back
in But Sarge hugs him holds him tells him (we can’t hear
but we read his lips) “It’s too late They’re gone”

CUT BACK TO

INT ELEVATOR ROOM - PRESENT
Sarge has turned from the elevator door to John as he speaks

SARGE
You and Sam weren’t supposed to be in
the van that night I almost died
saving you both --

JOHN
Thats bullshit

SARGE
What was I supposed to do Disobey a
direct order

JOHN
Yes

SARGE
Come on son let’s go up

JOHN
Look at your hands

Sarge grimaces as bone fragments tear through knuckles to
form a complementary set of new fingers

JOHN (contd)
I can’t let you go

SARGE
Then shoot me Now Give me the
dignity of a soldiers death Do it
John steadies his plasma cannon murmurs

JOHN
Pray For War

And FIRES just as the fluorescent bulb blinks OFF

When it blinks back on John takes a step toward the scorched
impact area Then stops Because theres no body

A SNARL Reaction time shortened he spins as something
flies from the darkness Hurls him backward

He lands ten feet away stands Sarge stands before him his
hands now completely mutated Slight tears in his skin
across his chest

The physical changes are few so far but it’s the attitude
This Sarge is meaner Faster And when he opens his
mouth

HE ROARS LIKE A BEAST

John looks to Sarge then to Sam who has pulled herself to
her feet Back to Sarge thenhe RUSHES for Sam Sarge
HOWLS takes off after him

In one motion John GRABS Sam by the hand forcibly tucks his
pistol into her waistband and IRISH WHIPS her into the
opened elevator She THUDS against the back wall loses her
air

John SMACKS the “up” button on the lift shaft then YANKS
both keys from their slots so that the command cannot be
halted The lift starts rising even before the doors close
fully and John uses this last window to look his sister in
the eyes

JOHN (contd)
If I’m not the one who comes out at
the topshoot him

Sam nods then SCREAMS as Sarge HURTLES into John from
behind BELLOWING He SWATS at John catching him upside the
head and sending him sprawling

In a desperate last attempt Sarge THRUSTS his hand between
the closing doors The doors grind to a halt partially
smashing Sarge’s arm He HOWLS paws at the doors

He manages to get his other hand in between the doors and
with superhuman strength PRIES THE DOORS OPEN He holds them
open just long enough for John to BODY TACKLE him through the
doors which SLAM shut behind them

The two are now sealed in the empty elevator shaft with the
floor of the lift car slowly rising upward above them Sarge
leaps back to his feet and BELLOWS

He punishes John with pile-driver blows John absorbs them
hurting as any man would -- but bouncing back unlike any man
could He grabs Sarge’s neck pulls his head back and

CRUNCH Slams his forehead into Sarge’s face A sickening
sound as Sarge’s frontal bone is smashed inward thrusting
his brow into his forehead Sarge howls but John is
relentless He pummels Sarge John only falters --
surprised -- when he HEARS

WEAPON ID
UAC Special Ops clearance verified
Handle Identification Sarge

John spins away but finding himself staring down the business
end of the BFG throws an elbow at the weapon jarring it

A BLAST of PLASMA just misses John’s face He KICKS Sarge in
the mouth bloody teeth bounce off the walls of the lift as --

-- John wrenches the BFG from Sarge’s grip But as he takes
aim Sarge is following the plasma’s trajectory staring at a
basketball-sized HOLE in the steel Its edges expanding by
the second as the BioForce degrades its molecular structure

Thick pipes are clearly visible through the hole BioForce
plasma oozes down their length Now a small hole opens in
one pipe a single DROP of WATER dribbles out Rolls quietly
into darkness below Then a TEAR of RENDING METAL and
Thousands of gallons pour into the shaft a massive deluge

CuT TO

INT ELEVATOR - SAME TIME

Sam looks expectantly to the iris door still many stories
above The elevator seems to be moving as slowly as
possible She is distracted looks down at her feet

TINY DROPS OF WATER are seeping through the floorboards
because now the shaft below her is totally full of water

CUT TO

INT ELEVATOR SHAFT

John rockets upward claustrophobic and terrified to be in
this situation after the horrors that it has afforded him in
the past

He can make out the bottom of the lift

-- and is yanked downward

He finds himself staring Sarge in the eyes Sarge holds
Johns legs in his oversized claws He now simply looks John
in the face bubbles rising from his putrid lips The calm
on his face makes it all the more unnerving Small HORNS are
bursting through Sarge’s forehead

Sarge can breathe underwater And John knows it Poetic --
this is how the nightmare started and this is how it ends

John swallows a lung-full of water A moment of anguish as
his body fights it Then all is still

CUT TO

INT ELEVATOR SHAFT - SAME

As Johns body sinks Sarge’s muscular frame BLASTS upward
He can see the surface of the water above the lift has now
elevated past the water level Like a torpedo he SHOOTS
toward up the shaft

CuT TO

INT ELEVATOR

The Iris Door starts to slowly HISS OPEN a hundred feet
above Sam relaxes

THUD The floor shakes THUD Again and now the bottom of
the lift is buckling Sam hugs the wall aims the pistol

CRASH Sarge’s torso TEARS through the bottom of the
elevator catching Sam by surprise Sarge SCREAMS whips his
one free arm out It SHATTERS Sam’s knee She drops the
pistol

Sarge tries to free his lower body Sam collects herself
summons every ounce of strength in her being She circles to
Sarge’s trapped left side and just starts KICKING THE SHIT
OUT OF HIS FACE

SAM
You took them all from me All of
them I’11 kill you myself

Sarge screams then winces as a BEAM OF SUNLIGHT hits his
face He looks up to the iris door now almost entirely open
and much closer He sees the door and he sees freedom And
he wants it Every muscle in his body FLEXES and the metal
trapping him tears Sam steps back horrified at this
display of strength

Sarge begins to rise from the hole in the floor

FADE TO

IMAGE

John Grimm eyes closed face peaceful Reuniting with his
parents for the first time in ten years He sinksand his
eyes SPRING OPEN

And we pull back and realize that we are still in the
present moment And then we remember

John has the 24th chromosome too JOHN CAN BREATHE
UNDERWATER

He takes a slow deep sustaining breath -- of H20 and
LAUNCHES upward

CUT TO

INT ELEVATOR - SAME TIME

Sarge pulls his battered lower body into the elevator

Stands above the barely conscious Sam bellows But she’s
not impressed She fought her fight Her fate is sealed and
she accepts it closes her eyes

Sarge ROARS pulls back a mighty pawand his eyes go WIDE

We PAN AROUND him to view John standing behind him just
emerged from the hole in the floor A look of determination
in his eyes unlike any in human history He holds a handful
of Sarge’s MANE

John allows Sarge a moment to comprehend the sudden reversal
of predatorprey relationshipthen YANKS BACKWARD throwing
Sarge to his back

Sarge tries several times to get up but John maintains his
grip on the mane SLAMMING Sarge’s head over and over into
the steel

He drops a knee into Sarge’s throat pinning the creature
grabs his pistol from the floor Sarge tries but cannot free
himself he’s met his match

JOHN
---It’s over

Neither a warrior’s death nor an honorable one But quick
John pulls the trigger and BOOM

FADE TO

INT WORMHOLE CHAMBER - A MOMENT LATER

John stands in front of the suspended TEARDROP this portal
to a strange planet in a solar system across the galaxy

JOHN
This is the way the world ends

He tosses a flash-bang grenade at the “droplet” which
swallows it We’re swallowed with the grenade into

INT WORMHOLE

A tunnel made of the very fabric of timespace --

It bursts into flame the traveling FIREBALL expands in heat

and velocity exponentially so by the time it reaches

INT CENTRAL LABORATORY (OLDUVAT)

The fireball has attained the magnitude of a tactical nuclear
bomb The skeletons of Lucy and her child are VAPORIZED
EXT OLDUVAI LAB - CONTINUOUS

The Olduvai Facility is totally consumed by the explosion
The fireball scorches the rugged terrain around the lab

Keep PULLING BACK as the fireball becomes no more than a hot
speck then disappears completely as we go higher and higher
looking down on dried-up lakes denuded forests and then
Keep PULLING BACK as we recognize continents shallow oceans
Keep PULLING BACK till we gaze upon the entire GLOBE from a
familiar perch in space From space it’s still blue still
beautiful HOLD on the planet the Grimms named “Olduvai”
We know it -- we knew it -- as EARTH

CUT BACK TO

INT GRIMMLABS WORMHOLE CHAMBER - SAME TIME

On our end of the Wormhole as the SHOCKWAVE ricochets -- but
not as a fireball With the portal’s destruction deep space
fills the void The sparse molecules (insanely cold between
100 Kelvin and absolute zero) blow through as a gas cloud

John has already taken off running for his life as the cloud
follows closely -- instantly freezing everything in its path

The once-perfect crystalline catwalks and walls have already
been reduced to a rubble of gore-flecked glass-like shards

John races across a landscape of humans demons and those
who could’ve been either but are now so much pulped carrion
In a moment all those bodies petrify into ice then SHATTER

INT ELEVATOR - SAME TIME

Breathless John barely makes it back Sam is curled up
pale and still almost fetal John scoops her into his arms
as the lift ascends seconds ahead of the freezing cloud

JOHN
(into communicator)
UACM Tactical Six this is Special
Ops code is “Q” level one
(gently to Sam)
Hang in there Sam were gonna get
help I’m not losing you again

EXT GRASSY FIELD - DAWN

The elevator breaks the surface the lift door opens John
steps into a daylight brilliantly illuminated by two suns

The two suns tell us that we are on another planet And have
been from the start John for his part has focused on

The several dozen SOLDIERS who keep their distance from the
iris door and John All aiming their weapons at him

He stands here holding his sister as a pair of UACM COMMANDOS
APPROACH Weapons drawn

COMMANDO
Who are you

JOHN
Adamand this is Eve

--on the first leg of a journey to Man’s new dawn as we --

FADE TO BLACK
