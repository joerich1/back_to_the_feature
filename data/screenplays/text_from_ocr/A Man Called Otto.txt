IE BUSY BEAVER HARDWARE STORE 2018 - DAY 1

OUTSIDE - the words “BUSY BEAVER” are spelled out across the
front of the hardware store in bold letters

INSIDE - OTTO (63 irascible) mutters his way through the
aisles He picks out a large screw hook examines various
kinds of rope Finally settling on one he measures five feet
and pulls out a pocket knife to cut it

A teenaged HARDWARE CLERK approaches wearing a shirt that
reads “Need Help Ask a Beaver”

HARDWARE CLERK
Can I help you with that sir

OTTO
(Turning incredulous )
You think I don’t know how to cut
rope

HARDWARE CLERK
No it’s just that we usually do
that for you

OTTO
I’m not an invalid

HARDWARE CLERK
No I - I didn’t think you were

OTTO
Are you worried I’m going to cut
myself Bleed all over your floor
then sue you for it

HARDWARE CLERK
No

OTTO
Well then -

Otto gestures for the clerk to leave him in peace A beat
the clerk goes Otto begins sawing through the rope

CUT TO

THE HARDWARE COUNTER - Otto sets the rope and screw hook on
the counter The young clerk begins ringing up his purchase
HARDWARE CLERK
Did you find everything you were
looking for

Otto grunts nods The clerk measures the rope against a
yardstick glued to the counter and adds it to Ottos total

HARDWARE CLERK (CONTD)
Good Okay That’ll be 347

OTTO
(Squints at the register )
You charged me for six feet of
rope

HARDWARE CLERK
Yes It’s 99 cents a yard

OTTO
But I didn’t get two yards I got
five feet

HARDWARE CLERK
We don’t charge by the foot we
charge by the yard

OTTO
99 cents a yard is 33 cents a foot -
times five that’s 165

HARDWARE CLERK
I know but I can’t put it into the
computer that way

OTTO
What the hell kind of computer
can’t do simple math

HARDWARE CLERK
Yeah I’m sorry I think they
sell rope by the foot over at the
Home Depot if you want

OTTO
I don’t want to go to the goddamn
Home Depot Where’s your manager

HARDWARE CLERK
He’s at lunch

OTTO
(Shaking his head )
Lunch

(MORE)
OTTO (CONT’D)
All anyone wants to do anymore is
go to lunch Is anyone else in
charge

HARDWARE CLERK
You want the Assistant Manager

OTTO
Yes

HARDWARE CLERK
Hey Taylor

TAYLOR (a baby-faced teen) appears at the back of the store

TAYLOR
What’s up

OTTO
(To the Clerk squinting )
She’s the Assistant Manager How
old is she
(To Taylor )
Shouldn’t you be in gym class

TAYLOR
-- Sorry - what

Another HARDWARE CUSTOMER (male 40s) who has gotten in line
behind Otto digs in his pocket for change

HARDWARE CUSTOMER
Here I have some change Let me
cover that extra 33 cents for you -

OTTO
I don’t want your 33 cents This
isn’t about 33 cents This is about
the fact that I only got five feet
of rope and I shouldn’t have to pay
for six feet unless I get six feet

TAYLOR
Do you want another foot of rope

Otto turns to gape at her astounded

INT OTTOS HOUSE - BEFORE DAWN 2
IN MONTAGE - Otto goes about his morning routine

- OTTOS DARKENED BEDROOM the moment the clock by Ottos
bedside hits 530 am his eyes open - no alarm necessary

hand He regards himself in the mirror a beat then turns
the shaver on and begins shaving

EXT OTTOS HOUSENEIGHBORHOOD - MORNING (MONTAGE) 3

- Otto steps OUTSIDE annoyed to see an ad flyer lying on his
front walk As he picks it up he becomes aware of an acrid
scent He bends down and sniffs the sidewalk glowers

- OTTOS STREET Otto checks cars for parking permits and
picks up all the flyers tossed in front of homes

The homes on this street share exterior walls Signs have
been placed in front of several saying they’re “Available
for Lease by BIRCHWOOD REALTY - A DYE and MERICA Company”

JIMMY (20s) a heavyset young man in a sweatsuit power-
walks past Otto swinging tiny hand weights

JIMMY
Hey Otto

Otto barely nods continues onward

- Otto goes to the RECYCLING BINS near the row of garages at
the end of the street and throws out all the flyers he’s
collected He notices people have mixed their glass and
paper together despite angry posted signs and uses a reach
extender tool to sort items into the right bins

A bike leans against one of the bins Otto rolls it over to
a bike rack A teenager MALCOLM (17 transgender boy
perceived as a boy by others) runs up toward Otto

MALCOLM
Hey What the hell - That’s mine

OTTO
It belongs on the bike rack

MALCOLM
I was only gone half a minute
OTTO
The next time I’m locking it in
the lost and found

MALCOLM
(Riding away under his
breath )
Grumpy old bastard

- As Otto heads up the block he notices REUBEN (60s African-
American in a wheelchair) gazing vacantly out the front
window of his home as his wife ANITA tries to feed him

Anita glances up Otto looks away headed onward toward

- The GATE that restricts traffic at the far end of the
street A sign posted on the gate reads

THIS IS NOT A THRU STREET
CARS WITH REGISTERED PERMITS ONLY
NO PARKING FOR BIRCHWOOD ESTATES

On the far side of the gate across the road a staircase
leads up to Birchwood Estates a complex of newer condos

Otto tugs on the gate to make sure it’s latched then
notices tire tracks in the grass to one side where someone
has driven around the gate He glares across the street at
a sign that reads “Birchwood Estates - Main offices”

Otto notices ANDY (late 20s wearing yoga pants) jogging up
and down the Birchwood steps Andy waves as he goes into a
series of groin stretches Otto turns away vaguely ill

- As Otto heads back he sees BARB (20s sunglasses heels)
walking her little dog PRINCE Otto calls out to her

OTTO
Don’t you dare let that little rat
dog of yours piss on my walkway
again I know it was you

Barb stiffens She guides Prince quickly past Otto
BARB
Ignore him Prince He’s a nasty
bitter old man And he has no idea
who’s doing that

OTTO
Well it was one of you -

Otto swings a foot in the dog’s general direction
BARB
Oh my God

Otto continues walking calling over his shoulder

OTTO
And tell your useless boyfriend to
stop stretching his groin in
public He’s dressed like a 14-year
old Romanian gymnast for God’s
sake

- Otto takes out his keys walking to his GARAGE then stops
A MANGY CAT with patchy fur stands in front of the garage
door It has half a tail one ear and a squint in one eye
which it uses to size up Otto like a gunslinger

Otto stomps toward The Cat expecting to scare it off The
Cat raises its head puffs out what fur it has left and
hisses Otto pauses surprised and a little impressed -
then he hisses back charging forward and waving his arms

OTTO (CONT’D)
Go on Get out of here

The Cat watches Otto charge gives what looks like a
disdainful roll of the eyes then turns and saunters off

Otto opens his garage door and goes inside then drives his
10-year old Chevy Malibu out headed to
EXT STIMCO STEEL AND ALUMINUM FABRICATION CORP - DAY 4

Otto arrives in the parking lot of “STIMCO STEEL”

INT STIMCO STEEL PRODUCTION FLOORMAIN OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 5

Otto enters and crosses the open production floor
METALWORKERS in hardhats weld bend and shape steel rods and
metal sheeting into various shapes others use beam cranes
and overhead winches to load trucks with beams and rebar

Otto climbs a short staircase and goes into the front room of
the MAIN OFFICE bewildered to find a group of CO-WORKERS
huddled inside waiting for him A tepid cheer goes up among
the workers as they gather around Otto with anxious smiles
Otto notices a cake on a nearby table with his picture on it
and the words “Congratulations Otto” along with a stack of
plates cups soda and balloons

Ottos BOSS (40s) comes forward clapping and smiling
BOSS
There he is - the big man himself

He approaches Otto with open arms intending to give him an
embrace - but when he sees Ottos sullen demeanor he quickly
abandons the notion giving Otto two thumbs up instead

The applause dies Otto nods toward the cake

OTTO
What is this

BOSS
It’s a well retirement cake I
guess - call it what you like

OTTO
“Have Fun” Doing what

BOSS
With the rest of your life We
wanted to you know

OTTO

BOSS
Yes - well no - give you a nice
send-off

OTTO
What’s nice about it

BOSS

decided to leave - and you did get
a nice severance package

OTTO

You took me off Operations you cut
back my hours and you made Terry
who I trained my supervisor -

(Pointing to a colleague )
Terry - who can barely figure out
what year it is without a
calculator So yes I took the
severance package

Awkward pause Terry sulks Some look shocked others fight
back laughter A few look as though they want to applaud

BOSS
I’m sorry you see it that way We
all had to adjust after the merger
(MORE )
BOSS (CONTD)
But you’ve been quite an asset to
this company over the years so -

A couple CO-WORKERS chime in

CO-WORKER 1
You have Reliable as hell

CO-WORKER 2

of yours

The others laugh The Boss grabs a cake knife from the desk
starts to offer it to Otto then reconsiders handing it to
CO-WORKER 1 The Boss grabs a plastic cup raises a toast

BOSS
To Otto

CO-WORKERS
To Otto

Another cheer Someone turns on music CO-WORKER 1 cuts the
cake slicing through the pic of Otto’s face on the icing

CO-WORKER 1
Hey Otto - you want a piece of
your face

Beat Otto turns to his boss pointing through a window
toward his desk in the adjoining room

OTTO
How am I supposed to finish work
today with all this going on

BOSS
You don’t have to work today Have
some cake why don’t you

OTTO
I still have open orders to fill

BOSS
Don’t worry about those I gave
them all to Terry You’re done

Beat Otto crosses into his office and takes a small photo of
a beautiful woman (SONYA) from his desk The others watch
stunned as he goes back through the front room and leaves
the office without a word
BOSS (CONTD)
(Gesturing to the cake)
Who’s hungry

TERRY

INT OTTOS LIVING ROOM - DAY 8

Otto moves the coffee table puts newspaper down on the floor

and sets a chair down on top Ottos drill is on the side

table along with the rope and screw hook he purchased

Otto climbs onto the chair and knocks on the ceiling to find

the joist He drills a hole in the ceiling twists the screw

hook into it then makes a noose and ties it on

As he starts to slip the noose over his head he notices a

framed picture of Sonya on the side table Otto climbs down

and turns the picture around so Sonya isn’t watching him

He gets back onto the chair puts the noose around his neck
As he starts to lean forward he hears a loud scraping sound

Otto looks out through the blinds stunned to see that
someone with a trailer hitched to their car has backed their
trailer up onto the sidewalk across the street

OTTO
What the - Oh for -

He pulls his head out of the noose and hurries to the door

EXT OTTOS HOUSE - DAY 9

Otto rushes outside and crosses the street directing his
anger at an extremely pregnant woman (MARISOL 30 Latina)
who was apparently trying to direct the parking job

OTTO
What the hell are you doing

MARISOL
(Mexican accent )
Yes that’s what I was saying -
(Turning to the car)
éQue diablos estas haciendo

She sounds angrier than Otto which throws him

OTTO
Look you can’t just drive in here -

MARISOL
I’m not driving am I

Flustered Otto turns to TOMMY (30s Latino) the tall oddly
cheerful guy who’s just climbed out of the car

OTTO
You aren’t allowed to bring a car
in here without a permit

TOMMY
(Mexican accent )
We have one Here -

Tommy digs in his pocket and produces the permit that is
supposed to hang on his rearview mirror

OTTO
Why the hell is it in your pocket

TOMMY
I’m the driver

MARISOL
(Pointing to a house)
Were renting here 206

OTTO
That doesn’t mean you can back the
trailer up to your front door

TOMMY
I wasn’t I was parallel parking

OTTO
Parallel to what

TOMMY
Yeah - it didn’t go so well No
real harm done at least

Otto points to the rear end of the trailer which is pushing
against the low bushes in front of the house they’re renting

OTTO
Youre in the flowerbed

TOMMY
That’s not really a flowerbed is
it

OTTO

Not anymore it isn’t

Tommy looks to Marisol She glares at him Tommy realizes
he’s outnumbered heads back to the car

TOMMY
Okay I’1l give it another try

Otto and Marisol watch as Tommy struggles to climb into the
tiny car both shaking their heads and sighing

OTTO MARISOL
My God Dios mio

Tommy closes his door and starts the engine The car lurches
into the street then backs up heading over the curb once
again straight toward the front of the house

OTTO (CONTD)
STOP

Otto storms forward and yanks open the car door

TOMMY
My bad I thought I was home free -

OTTO
Get out of the car

Tommy gets out abashed Otto pushes him aside and climbs in

OTTO (CONT’D)
How you can have made it this far
in life without knowing how to back
up a trailer

(MORE )

OTTO (CONTD)
My God a dog with one front paw
and cataracts could have done
better than that

Otto shuts the door shaking his head when he sees the
digital instrument panel

OTTO (CONT’D)
Automatic of course
(Rolling down the window )
Give me the keys

TOMMY
They’re in the cupholder But it’s
a push button start

OTTO
I know

Otto looks around for the push button start

TOMMY
It’s still running The engine
shuts off when you stop -

OTTO
I know

Otto puts the car in reverse An electronic bell sounds

OTTO (CONT’D)
What the -

TOMMY
(Pointing to the dash)
That’s the radar It goes off in
reverse because the trailer’s so
close to the back of the -

Otto rolls the window up cutting off further discussion He
pulls forward and looks over his shoulder - finally noticing
the two children LUNA and ABBIE who are sitting in
the back seat

LUNA
Hello

OTTO
Hello

The bell sounds again as Otto begins backing the trailer into
the parking spot

LUNA
What’s your name

OTTO
Otto

Abbie’s never heard this name before and finds it funny

ABBIE
Oddo

OTTO
Otto O-t-t-o

ABBIE
I’m Abbie O-t-t-o

LUNA
And I’m Luna

OTTO
Nice to meet you

He stops the car in front of his house throws it in park and
gets out marching back toward Tommy to hand him the keys

OTTO (CONTD)
You should turn that radar crap
off Anyone who thinks they need
radar to back up a car shouldn’t be
doing it in the first place

TOMMY
Thanks for the help

OTTO
They shouldn’t even be allowed to
use the radio

Otto catches Marisols eye She looks like she’s trying not
to laugh Otto walks back toward his house calling

OTTO (CONTD)
The permit goes on your rearview
mirror not in your damn pocket

10 INT OTTOS HOUSE - DAY 10

Otto enters and closes the door behind him muttering

OTTO
Idiot

Otto sinks onto a bench in the hall exhausted He glances up
at the sea of women’s coats that hang on wall pegs light
from the windows drifting across the space as time passes -

And then the lights click off

Otto glances around He rises goes into the living room
tries the light switch Nothing His power has been shut off

He opens the window blinds then realizes the noose is
visible from outside and shuts them enough to block the view

Otto turns to look at the noose Beat He straightens his
suit climbs onto the chair then stops noticing something

Otto climbs back down fixes the pillows on the couch He
goes to the bookcase and straightens the books pausing to
glance at a few of the titles drifting back in his memory

FLASH BACK TO

The light in the room changes the blinds fully open Otto is
still in his 60s but the scene he remembers takes place in
1980 decades earlier and the room reflects it

WOMANS VOICE (0S)
How much more shelf space is left

Otto turns watching as SONYA enters carrying a box

OTTO
Three shelves How many boxes of
books do you have left

Sonya walks past Otto and sets the box of books on the side
table As the camera follows Sonya we see YOUNG OTTO reflected in a darkened television screen across the room

SONYA
Seven or eight

Young Otto picks the box up from the side table

YOUNG OTTO
Then I’1l1 build you another
bookcase

Pan back to Otto still lost in memory As he crosses the
room the light fades and when he gets to the side table
Sonya Young Otto and the book box are all gone

Otto gazes at his older reflection in the television the

noose still hanging from the ceiling behind him

END FLASHBACK

Otto climbs back on the chair and tightens the noose The
doorbell rings Otto pauses exasperated Another knock

OTTO
Damnit Damnit Damnit

Otto climbs down and goes to the front door

IE OTTO

S HALLWAY FRONT DOOR - CONTINUOUS

She offers him the Tupperware container Otto nods takes it

OTTO

He starts to close the door Marisol places her foot onto the
threshold speaking in the tone of a mother teaching manners

MARISOL
My name is Marisol

Otto stares at the foot in disbelief then raises his head to
look Marisol in the eye

TOMMY
I’m Tommy

Otto and Marisol eyes locked pay no mind to Tommy

MARISOL
Are you always this unfriendly

OTTO
I am not unfriendly

MARISOL
No I’d say you are a little
unfriendly

(Mocking Tommy’s accent )
“Umm no it’s an Alvin Wrench”

TOMMY

continue bickering

Otto winces He hands Tommy the wrench set and closes the
garage door

OTTO
Take the set

TOMMY
Wow Thanks

MARISOL
Yes thank you Otto Come along
Tommy - Otto has things to do

Otto watches them go back to their house then notices the
Mangy Cat has shown up and is now staring at him

OTTO
What do you want Huh

They gaze at each other a beat then Otto heads back to his
house
IE OTTOS HOUSE - DAY 12

Otto enters the DINING ROOMKITCHEN and sits at the table He
notices the Tupperware container in his hands Pause

He opens the lid sniffs it then gets a fork and sits down
to eat staring at the noose in the living room as he chews

There is food left over when Otto finishes He goes to the
trash can realizes he hasn’t replaced the bag Beat He gets
a colorful bowl out of the cupboard scoops the leftovers
into it and takes it OUTSIDE for the Mangy Cat to finish
Otto sets the bowl on the stoop and turns to go - then
reconsiders moving the bowl further from the front door
before going back inside

Otto returns to the LIVING ROOM climbs up on the chair

He tightens the noose around his neck braces himself

Then kicks the stool out from under him

As Otto struggles memories of Sonya flash through his mind
(‘LIFE FLASHES PAST’ MONTAGE) -

- OTTO’S POV Sonya drops a book on a TRAIN PLATFORM It is
1973 she’s just 18 years old

- She sits across from him in the DINING ROOM of their new
home raising a coffee cup in a toast and
smiling

- She lies in BED slips her finger into Otto’s open palm
PRE-LAP A disconnected voice that of OTTOS FATHER

OTTOS FATHER (0S)
Isn’t she beautiful son

- A BOYHOOD MEMORY 1965 (POV CONTINUES) - Otto remembers
gazing up at his Father as he opens the hood of a 1950s
CHEVY IMPALA and looks at the engine approvingly

OTTOS FATHER (CONT’D)
Carburetor spark plugs pistons -
it all works together nothing’s
wasted That’s a Chevy engine for
you Dependable Not enough you can
depend on in this world

The scene fades from view as (OUT OF POV)

BACK IN OTTOS LIVING ROOM (INTERCUT) - Ottos struggling
slows He drifts back into memory one last time

- OTTOS POV Sonya’s face appears It is 1983 she is 29
She smiles but there are tears in her eyes

SONYA
That’s enough now darling

As she reaches out to touch Ottos cheek Otto’s vision
BLURS TO WHITE

OUT OF POV - the world around Otto begins spinning the
LIVING ROOM fading from view

PULL BACK as debris seems to fly through the air all around
Otto He hears his father’s voice one last time

OTTOS FATHER (VO)
If you’re going to make something
Otto learn how to make it right

END FLASHBACK MONTAGE
BACK IN OTTO’S LIVING ROOM - CRACK The dried wood of the

ceiling joist gives way and the screw hook pulls free Otto
falls into the present crashing to the floor coughing

13A

He yanks the noose off and throws it down in disgust He
starts to get up then hesitates wincing as he grips his
left arm The pain gradually fades Otto notices a coupon in
the newspaper on the floor for flowers - two for eight
dollars

EXT CEMETERY -— SUNSETDUSK 13

Otto walks across an expanse of grass carrying a lawn chair
a thermos and some potted flowers He unfolds the lawn
chair puts the thermos beside it

OTTO
I found the flowers you like Pink

Otto sets the flowers in front of the grave marker of SONYA
ANDERSON He clears away old flowers leaves and twigs

OTTO (CONTD)
Sorry I didn’t come earlier I got
distracted by the new neighbors
The husband doesn’t know his ass
from an Allen wrench

(He sits Scornfully )

They’re renters of course No
commitment to anything

Otto reacts as though he’s heard Sonya disagree with him

OTTO (CONT’D)
I know - maybe they can’t afford to
buy yet but where will they be
when those real estate bastards
decide to tear that house down and
put up more shit condos Because it
will happen I promise you They’re
already driving on the grass
(He shakes his head)

“Dye and Merica” - what idiot thought
that was a good name for a real
estate company Sounds like ‘dying

America’ It is I suppose Can’t
even buy a decent screw hook
anymore

(Long pause)
Nothing works when you’re not home

EXT OTTO’S HOUSE - NIGHT 13A

Darkness A light snow falls

INT OTTOS BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING 14

The next morning Ottos eyes are still shut He shifts as he
dreams stretching a hand toward the other side of the bed

IN HIS DREAMS Sonya lies beside him in bed She reaches over
and slips her index finger into his palm

Ottos eyes open His hand is empty He glances at the clock
surprised that it’s only 512 Otto lies back down then
gazes at the window curtains beside his bed remembering

MATCH CUT TO
EXT MILITARY ENTRANCE STATION 1973 (MEMORY) - DAY 15

Curtains open as a DOCTOR enters an examination area Otto
(still 63) sits on an exam table Other RECRUITS in their
underwear stand in line outside waiting for their turns

As the DOCTOR looks at a chart we see Ottos reflection
behind the Doctor in a mirror - as Young Otto The
Doctor looks up with a kind smile The camera turns back to
reveal Young Otto sitting on the exam table

NOTE In this and other memory sequences I have indicated
when Young Otto appears and which lines of dialogue he
speaks Marc though will frequently shoot alternate
versions of these sequences in which Otto himself performs
the same dialogue in order to have more flexibility in the
editing room

ARMY DOCTOR
- I suspect you have Hypertrophic
Cardiomyopathy which is a genetic
enlargement of -

YOUNG OTTO
I know My father had it

ARMY DOCTOR
(A sympathetic nod)
Well you’ll likely be around a
good long time - but I’m afraid
your military prospects end here

INT OTTOS BEDROOM - MORNINGINTERCUT 16

CLOSE ON OTTO back in his bedroom remembering

EXT TRAIN TERMINAL 1973 (MEMORY) - DAY 17

Otto walks through a sleek modern train station He crosses
to a ticket counter the surface of which is reflective

As Otto pulls out his wallet to buy a ticket TILT DOWN to
the surface of the counter revealing Young Otto’s
reflection then TILT BACK UP - Young Otto now stands at the
counter

Young Otto buys his ticket then heads down a GATE RAMP that
leads to the train platform lowering his head in
embarrassment as he passes young men in uniform

EXT TRAIN PLATFORM 1973 (MEMORY) - DAY 18

Young Otto arrives on the Eastbound platform which is lined
with posters of the era the style of the other PASSENGERS
ranges from long hair and tie-dye to crewcuts and business
suits

Young Otto steps up to the track Sonya appears on the
Westbound platform across from him Young Otto is spellbound

As Sonya walks along the platform Otto notices her drop one
of the books she carries He calls to her but she doesn’t
hear him because her train is pulling into the station

Young Otto rushes back into the terminal up the GATE RAMP
and down a set of stairs appearing a moment later on the
Westbound platform He picks up the book sees Sonya boarding
at the other end of the platform He starts toward her then
realizes that the train is departing and jumps into the
nearest car before the doors close

INT TRAIN 1973 (MEMORY) - CONTINUOUS 19

As Young Otto hurries through cars trying to find Sonya we
catch glimpses of Otto (60s) reflected in the train windows

As he hurries through another car he catches sight of
someone out of the corner of his eye He looks back - and
stops his tracks speechless Sonya looks up at him She
smiles not hiding her interest then sees the book

SONYA
Is that mine

YOUNG OTTO
- What
(Glances down nods gives
her the book)
Yes

SONYA
Oh thank you so much I’m already
halfway through - I would hate not
knowing how it ends

Young Otto nods Not knowing what to say he starts to leave

SONYA (CONT’D)
(She moves her purse from
the seat opposite her)
Here - why don’t you join me

Young Otto sits tries not to look as awkward as he feels

SONYA (CONTD)
I’m Sonya

YOUNG OTTO
Otto It was my father’s name

SONYA
I’m on my way to visit my father
right now - I go every Thursday Do
you take this train a lot

YOUNG OTTO
No I had to come into town for my
army physical

SONYA
(Eyes wide with sympathy )
Oh God That must be hard not
knowing what you’re going to face
over there When are you leaving

YOUNG OTTO
Not for a while

The TRAIN CONDUCTOR comes up alongside their seats

TRAIN CONDUCTOR
Tickets please

Sonya and Young Otto hand him their tickets The Train
Conductor glances at Young Ottos ticket hands it back

TRAIN CONDUCTOR (CONT’D)
I’m afraid you’re on the wrong
train This is an Eastbound ticket

YOUNG OTTO
(Fumbles for his wallet)
Oh - I must have I’m getting off
at the next station How much -

TRAIN CONDUCTOR

Young Otto pulls out his last dollar searches for change
comes up short Sonya finds some coins in her purse

SONYA
Here - I have some change

YOUNG OTTO
Thank you

He pays the conductor then holds a quarter out to Sonya

YOUNG OTTO (CONT’D)
A quarter to spare
(Showing the edge )
1964 Pure silver

SONYA
Keep it then It’s lucky

She smiles Otto nods tucks the coin in his shirt pocket

YOUNG OTTO
I will pay you back

SONYA
Don’t worry about that for now

Sonya gestures to the book Otto rescued

SONYA (CONTD)
“The Master and Margarita” - have
you read it

YOUNG OTTO
No I No

SONYA
I love books I’m studying to be an
English teacher I’ve always wanted
to work with kids

Young Otto drinks Sonya in as she talks completely smitten
Her words flow by as time passes He nods along and smiles
without fully understanding what she’s talking about

SONYA (CONT’D)
You know there’s a scene in
the book with a draft-dodging

cat for a class on magical
realism and fantasy but I loved
“One Hundred Years of Solitude”

Isn’t this your stop

Beat Young Otto blinks glances toward the window the
camera following his gaze The train has stopped As the
camera pans back we hear Otto (60s) answer Sonya’s question

OTTO (0C)
Oh yes
INT OTTOS BEDROOM - MORNING 20

OTTO
Yes it is

Light has begun creeping in at the window Otto notices the
clock still reads 512 He tries to turn on the light
Nothing Otto gets his watch from the bedside table looks at
it curses - his alarm clock stopped when the power went out

He bounds out of bed and pulls a shirt out of his closet
then grabs Sonya’s quarter from the dish by his bedside

EXT OTTOS HOUSE - DAY 21

Otto hurries outside carrying the empty Tupperware container
It has snowed a light dusting He crosses the street and

that the cat bowl he left out the night before is empty

Merica logo pulls out of a parking space As it reaches the
corner the car turns and bumps up over the curb intending
to drive around the gate Otto hurries toward the car waving
his arms

OTTO (CONT’D)
Hey HEY

JIMMY

The car stops A DYE and MERICA REAL ESTATE AGENT (40s) gets
out

OTTO
This is a private road Those gates
are there to keep down on traffic -
not for idiots like you to drive
around them and tear up the grass

The Agent waves a placating hand He goes to open the gate

DYE and MERICA AGENT
Okay - fair enough You got me
Ill have our grounds people come
over and fix that grass for you
(He climbs in his car)
You have a good one now okay

He shuts his door and drives away leaving the gate open

EXT OTTOS HOUSE - DAY 23

As Otto heads back home he hears frantic barking Barb
stands out in front of Otto’s house her dog Prince straining
at his leash Otto watches in astonishment as Barb picks up a
stone and throws it towards the front of his house

BARB
Get out here you little bitch

Otto hurries forward stepping up close behind Barb as she
picks up another stone and cocks her arm to throw it

OTTO
If you throw one more stone I
swear to God I will drop-kick that
dog of yours over the roof

BARB
(Wheels around glaring )
I’m not throwing it at your house
That rotten cat scratched Prince
I’m gonna kill that piece of shit

Otto sees the Mangy Cat cowering behind the low front wall of
his porch The Cat licks a paw rubs it over a bloodied ear

OTTO
No you won’t

BARB
What do you care That thing’s
feral It’s probably full of all
sorts of disgusting diseases

OTTO
So are you most likely but we
don’t throw stones at you

Barb flinches in shock She sees Andy headed toward them
doing a squat lunge with each step he takes

BARB
Andy Did you hear what he said

Otto heads for his front door The Cat stares at him

OTTO
Get out of here while you can
(Swinging a lazy kick in
the cat’s direction )
Go on I’m not your friend

The Cat is unimpressed but takes Ottos advice and goes
24 INT OTTOS FRONT DOORLIVING ROOM - DAY

Otto flicks the front light switch as he enters Nothing

He returns to his living room and looks up at the hole in the
ceiling where the screw hook pulled out of the joist

A SHORT TIME LATER - Otto stands on a chair with a roll of
duct tape using it to patch the hole in the ceiling

There is a knock at the door Otto sighs climbs down and
crosses to open it Marisol and Tommy stand outside

OTTO

ToMMy (CONTD)
-- If you have a ladder I could
borrow Our window is jammed

OTTO
(Mystified )
Your window is what

TOMMY
(Pointing )
It’s jammed That one up there It
won’t open

OTTO
So you want to try to open it from
the outside

TOMMY

Otto struggles mightily to keep from further comment

OTTO
Come on then

As he leads them DOWN THE STREET Otto notices Abbie and Luna
rolling a ball of snow to start making a snowman he almost
smiles Abbie waves

ABBIE
Hola “O-t-t-o”

Otto winces a little but waves back

MARISOL
Use your English Abbie
(To Otto explaining )
It’s the first time they’ve seen
snow

As they round the corner on the way to Otto’s garage they
come upon Anita who is just closing her own garage door

ANITA
Oh - Otto good I hate to bother
you but our heat doesn’t seem to
be working Could you take a look

OTTO
Try bleeding the radiators

ANITA
How exactly would I do that

OTTO
By bleeding the radiators

Otto opens his own garage door and disappears inside
MARISOL
Otto Stop being rude

OTTO (0S)
I’m not being rude

ANITA
It can be hard to tell the

difference with Otto sometimes

MARISOL

We just moved into 206 across from
Otto I’m Marisol This is Tommy

Anita gives a warm smile instantly chatty

ANITA

Welcome to the neighborhood dear
I’m Anita My husband Reuben used
to take care of our heat but he’s
not been well We always knew the
day would come when he couldn’t
help around the house any longer

Otto comes out of his garage carrying the ladder

OTTO

Maybe Reuben should have thought of
that when he organized his coup

ANITA

Oh please That was years ago -

(To Marisol )

Otto used to be the head of our
Homeowner’s Association but when
the board voted Reuben in Otto

quit

OTTO
It was a coup

MARISOL

Come on Otto Can’t you just go
breathe Anita’s radiators for her

OTTO

You don’t breathe radiators
Gods sake You bleed them

Tommy has moved away from the others
metal ramp just inside the garage He

for

noticing a portable
starts to lift it

TOMMY
Look at this ramp Marisol This is
what we needed for the trailer

ANITA
Oh that was for Sonya -

OTTO
(Furious )
What are you doing Leave my things
alone Put that down take the
goddamn ladder and get out of here

ANITA
I’m sorry Otto I didn’t mean to -

OTTO
GO All of you

As they leave Otto notices Abbie and Luna have been watching
at a distance They look away turning back to building their
snowman

Otto fumbles in frustration and goes close his garage door
then notices a mangy tail poking out from under his car’s
bumper

OTTO (CONT’D)
Get out from under there

He swings his foot under the bumper The Cat yowls and swings
a paw getting its long claws snagged in Ottos pant leg

OTTO (CONTD)
Ow Let go of me you little -

Otto pulls his leg back dragging the Cat out from under the
car Otto sees that the Cat’s claws are stuck in his pants

OTTO (CONTD)

Okay okay - calm down I’1l get
your claws free just hold still
(Slowly reaching down )

If you bite me I swear to God
I’1l bite you back

Otto carefully pulls the Cat’s claws free The Cat scrambles
backward It turns away from Otto in an attempt at retaining
some dignity licks its paw then walks haughtily away

IE ANITA AND REUBEN’S HOUSE FRONT DOOR - DAY 25

Otto walks onto the stoop of Anita and Reuben’s house and
knocks Anita opens the door

OTTO

Anita nods grows emotional Her hand trembles as she speaks

ANITA
That’s what I said but they’ve
been talking to our boy Chris Now
he’s saying I can’t take care of
Reuben anymore that he needs to go
into a special care place and I
have to go into a retirement home

OTTO
Oh what does Chris know about it
Chris is an idiot always has been
They can’t make you do anything

Otto follows Anita into the living room Reuben sits in his
wheelchair by the window Otto sees his condition up close

for the first time - unable to speak and barely able to move

OTTO (CONT’D)
Does he even know we’re here

ANITA
Of course Don’t let him fool you -
he’s still in there
(She turns to go)
I’1l go look for the hose

A SHORT TIME LATER Otto kneels beside the front radiator
talking conspiratorially to Reuben as he bleeds out air

OTTO
This neighborhood is falling apart
nowadays They don’t even have a
Homeowner’s Association anymore
There’s no one to keep things
running Not like we did

He catches a few drops of water in his handkerchief closes
the bleeder valve and rises turning toward Reuben

OTTO (CONTD)

Just to be clear - I still haven’t
forgiven you I just didn’t realize
you were going to fall to shit so
quickly And now they’re tearing
apart everything we worked so hard
to build We haven’t even left yet
and they’re trying to erase us

Otto crouches beside Reuben’s chair lowers his voice

OTTO (CONTD)
Well I’m not staying around to see
that happen I’m leaving For good -

Voices approach outside Anita enters the front door hose
hand Jimmy behind her She hands Otto the hose

ANITA
Thank you Otto I’m sorry it took
me so long to get this back to you
Would you like to stay for lunch

Otto snorts dismissively

JIMMY
Anita made a pork tenderloin

in

OTTO
No I have things I need to do

Otto starts to go then realizes Reuben has a firm grip on
the hose Reuben’s eyes are fixed on his

ANITA

Reuben - what are you doing hon

Otto pulls the hose from Reuben’s grasp Beat He walks
stiffly out of the room without looking back

MATCH CUTFLASH BACK TO
EXT TRAIN PLATFORM 1973 - DAY 30

Otto (60s) sits on a train bench watching people come and
go It’s a foggy morning dreamlike hard to recognize faces

A train pulls in Otto catches sight of a woman who looks
like Sonya boarding at the other end of the platform He
rises hurries toward her then tries to board Too late

Young Otto’s reflection appears in the train windows as the
doors close Young Otto watches as the train leaves the
station - then Sonya appears out of the fog smiling

SONYA
Looks like we’1ll both have to take
the next one

Young Otto nods overcome with shyness

SONYA (CONT’D)

military center

YOUNG OTTO
What Oh Yes I
(He gathers his courage)
No I wanted to pay you back for
the train ticket

SONYA

expectantly He changes his mind has more soup Finally

SONYA
So what kinds of things interest
you

YOUNG OTTO

Interest me like

SONYA
What kinds of things do you like to
do What are you passionate about

YOUNG OTTO

(He thinks a moment)
Machines Engines I like knowing
how things work What each part
does to make a car run smoothly
It’s more complicated than most
people realize A carburetor has to
mix gas and air in just the right
combination then the spark plugs
ignite that mixture and that drives
the pistons which drive the
connecting rods and the driveshaft -

Otto sees Sonya trying to follow what he’s saying He grows
self-conscious and trails off shaking his head

SONYA
- Where did you learn so much
about cars

YOUNG OTTO
From my father That’s mostly all
we talked about He was a good dad
though Dependable

SONYA
He passed away

YOUNG OTTO
(Nods )
Two months ago It was sudden

SONYA
I’m sorry And your mom

YOUNG OTTO
I don’t remember her much Just how
it felt when she was gone

Sonya’s heart goes out to him She watches him sip his soup

SONYA
Why didn’t you get an entrée

YOUNG OTTO
(A pained confession )
-- I ate at home

SONYA
Why

YOUNG OTTO
So you could order what you wanted
(He sets his napkin down)
Look I lied to you I’m sorry I’m
not in the army - I couldn’t pass
my physical If I had at least Id
have a job now that’s what I was
counting on But now I don’t and I
don’t know what I’m going to do -
(He rises)
I should go

Young Otto rises about to excuse himself Sonya stands
takes Otto by the wrist and pulls him into a kiss Other
diners laugh and applaud As Fog envelopes the scene the
echoing applause morphs into a persistent banging noise

affectionately toward Young Otto nearly pressing their faces
together

hello to Otto

YOUNG OTTO
Hello

They are standing in the dirt driveway outside a rural
farmhouse A screen door creaks - Sonya turns as LUCAS (50s)
Sonya’s taciturn father comes out of the house

SONYA
Hey Daddy

Sony puts Ernest down and hurries forward to hug her father

Ernest goes onto the porch to eat food from the same colorful
bowl that Otto finds in his cupboard years later Young Otto

hangs back a moment as Sonya and Lucas greet one another

(Slight Swedish accent )
Got tired of not shaving

Sonya steps back turns to Young Otto

SONYA

falling on the pickup in the driveway Otto notices the logo
on the truck - Chevy - and visibly relaxes

LUCAS
It is

YOUNG OTTO
Well that’s a fine truck Did you
get the automatic transmission

LUCAS
Nope Never saw the need for one

off and climbs out

YOUNG OTTO
The timing needs to be adjusted
And you might need hotter plugs
That’11 cut down on how much gas
you’re burning I can take care of
that for you

Sonya walks up the driveway and peers into the barn watching
as the two men talk

LUCAS
Have you ever thought about opening
your own repair shop

YOUNG OTTO
(Closing the hood)
I have Sonya’s been talking to me
about taking some engineering
courses I might give that a try

LUCAS
All right then

Lucas turns and walks a few steps ahead of Young Otto on his
way out of the barn glancing at Sonya as he passes her

LUCAS (CONT’D)
He had better learn to fish

He leaves Young Otto approaches Sonya She hugs him elated

changed the plans but the laws

didn’t give a shit I did -

at the front one of them talks about improvements they’re
planning for Birchwood while the other points at blueprints
on a cork board

And we’re also putting in a new
playground and a daycare center -

Young Otto sitting at the front rises

YOUNG OTTO
None of this is wheelchair
accessible And you still havent
fixed any of the doors in the old
buildings or put in ramps -

DYE and MERICA REP 2
We have to set priorities Right
now we’re focused on the needs of
young families with kids

DYE and MERICA REP 1
Birchwood living is not for
everyone But there are plenty of
places these days for people like
your wife -

YOUNG OTTO
(Growing irate)
What does that mean - people like
her What does that mean

Young Otto explodes with anger striding forward and shoving
the man The other rep and Young Reuben move to restrain him

OTTO (VO)
I’d fought them before I’d fight
them again But I was so angry -
