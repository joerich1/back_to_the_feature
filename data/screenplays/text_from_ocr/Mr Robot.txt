ELLIOT (VO)
Hello friend Hello friend Thats
lame Maybe I should give you a name
But that’s a slippery slope You’re
only in my head We have to remember
that

(then)

Shit It’s actually happened I’m
talking to an imaginary person

Loud violent jazz RISES on the soundtrack Within the black
of frame silhouettes begin forming

ELLIOT (VO)
I sometimes think dinosaurs never
existed For absolutely no scientific
reason do I think this I have
chronic insomnia I think aliens are
real I think they’re invisible and
staring straight at us I also
believe there’s a shadowy group of
rich people who secretly run the
world

We pull out to reveal we’re in an office looking out of a very
tall Manhattan skyscraper Shadowy figures sit and stand
around a conference table arguing

ELLIOT (VO)
I’m talking about the ten or fifteen
zillionaires that we don’t know
about The guys who control the guys
that control The guys that play God
without permission

CUT TO BLACK

ELLIOT (VO)
And now I think they’re following me

INT NYC SUBWAY (MOVING) - MORNING

We finally meet ELLIOT (late 20s) His hoodie throws a sliced
shadow over his face

He sneaks looks at a couple of mysterious MEN DRESSED IN
BLACK one on either side of the train One reads the NY Post
The other looks straight ahead suspiciously so

ELLIOT (VO)
This is about last night I should
have gone to Angela’s birthday party--

INT PHIL’S COFFEE (FLASHBACK) - NIGHT

A small coffee shop with a few patrons A cheesy sign that
reads “Phil’s Coffee” displays proudly above Elliot sits by
himself hoodie on no coffee His leg taps nervously

Elliot intently watches as a mild-mannered Indian with a
mustache walks into the shop This is PHIL (50s)

He orders a latte from the front and sits alone He pulls out
his iPad and sips his latte enjoying the quiet evening to
himself

Elliot musters courage with a deep breath and walks over He
sits across from him without saying a word his leg twitching

Finally Phil looks up

ELLIOT
You’re Phil

He nervously gestures to the cheesy sign Confused Phil just
offers a quick smile in return--

ELLIOT (CONT’D)

But your real name is Rohit Pathak

(nervous and robotic)
You changed it to Phil when you
bought your first Phil’s Coffee shop
six years ago Now you have seventeen
of them with eight more coming next
quarter You married an American
woman named Linda Fielding age
thirty-one then had two kids with
her Smallbiztrendscom said your
life was so perfect it felt like “the
stuff of sitcoms”

An awkward silence Phil licks his lips not sure if he should
be flattered or concerned

PHIL
(thick Indian accent)
May I help you with something

ELLIOT
I liked coming here because the WIFI
was fast and with no dropouts It was
good So good that it scratched that
part of my mind-- the part that
doesn’t allow good to exist without
condition So I snooped on the
traffic and that’s when I noticed
something strange in the filenames--

i i i i i a

ee FF HF

Elliot looks down nervous to go on But he looks back up with
confidence

ELLIOT (CONT’D)
That’s when I decided to hack you

Another awkward silence Phil goes to say something--

ELLIOT (CONTD)
I know you run a website called
Lolita City

Alarms suddenly go off in Phil’s world

PHIL
Pardon me

ELLIOT
You use the company servers to run it
through Tor networking

SUPER “Tor Networking - a system intended to enable online
anonymity”

ELLIOT (CONTD)
Routing the traffic from shop to
shop making it virtually
untraceable You made it really hard
for anyone to see it

Even though Elliot came off a little amateurish at first his
confidence builds as he continues to talk

ELLIOT (CONTD)

But I saw it With all the public
info out there on you birth dates
anniversary dates family names
pets

(clears his throat)
I cracked your password in three
minutes

Angry and confused Phil eyes Elliot carefully

PHIL
SirWhat is the meaning of this

ELLIOT
(back to nervous)
Sorry I’m a little nervous It’s my
first time doing this in person

PHIL
(firm)
Sir I must ask you to kindly leave--

et FF HF

Phil turns to the man working the register--

ELLIOT
I downloaded everything All your
emails all your files all
yourpics

Phil turns back around This just got serious and it shows

PHIL
(angry)
Get out of here right now sir or I
will call the--

ELLIOT
FBI Do you want them to find out
about the 100GB of child pornography
you serve to your 400000 users
That’s a lot of bandwidth of course
which explains the higher than usual
speeds on all your shops’ internet
connections

Phil is stunned silent For a moment all that can be heard is
the soft musak and quiet sipping of coffee from the other
patrons Phil looks down cornered and speechless Elliot
looks genuinely sympathetic

ELLIOT (CONT’D)
Personally I was hoping it was just
going to be BDSM stuff Do you
realize how much simpler that would
have been

PHIL
So you are not with the police
(off his head shake)
Then this is illegal This is
forbidden sir I did not hurt
anyone I never did-- that is my
business my personal life

All the blood in Phil’s face as drained He wipes his eyes as
emotion begins to fill his face Elliot looks at him a mix of
pity and guilt

ELLIOT
I understand what it’s like to be
different I’m very different too I
mean I don’t jerk off to little
kids butI don’t know how to talk
people My dad was the only one I
could talk to But he died

Fe ee

e FF HH
At first Phil is unsure on how to proceed But sensing an
opportunity he takes a deep breath and nods sympathetically

PHIL
I’m sorry to hear that How did he
pass if I may ask

ELLIOT
Leukemia Definitely got it from the
radiation at the company he worked
at though we couldn’t prove it Now
he’s dead The company’s fine though

PHIL
My father passed when I was young
too I was close to him exactly like
you

His mind clearly elsewhere he can’t help but start crying
Elliot genuinely feels for him

ELLIOT
Can I call you Rohit I prefer your
real name Phil is kinda lame

Phil looks up and wipes away his tears He nods

ELLIOT (CONTD)
Rohit It’s okay I’m not gonna turn
you in

For the first time since we’ve seen him Phil is relieved
though still concerned Elliot looks out the windows as if
looking for something

ELLIOT (CONTD)
If you do what I say and pay me what
I ask we’ll both come out of this
happy Sitcom happy

PHIL

(scoffs shakes his head)
So that is what this is about
Money That is all you care about
No If I pay you now you will want
more and more No matter how much I
give you will inform the police
anyway I won’t pay you sir
Remember you also broke the law

Elliot notices something outside the window and nods

ELLIOT
Actually you’re right Partly
Elliot stands putting his oversized bookbag on

ELLIOT (CONTD)
After looking at your calendar I
knew you were coming here You always
have a nightly check-in at all of
your stores once a month You’re a
good boss like that I waited until
you came to this one This one was
more convenient for me

Phil looks around wondering what Elliot is talking about

PHIL
I do not understand

ELLIOT
See I usually do this kind of thing
from my computer This time I wanted
to do it AFK

SUPER “AFK - Away From Keyboard”

ELLIOT (CONTD)
I’m trying to work on my social
anxiety But there’s always the
threat of you fleeing after I call
you out You’d tell your webmaster to
take the servers down delete the
dirty pics and mpegs So I took the
liberty of making sure to include the
current time and location on my
anonymous tip--

PHIL
(desperate nervous)
Wait hold on I will give you the
money I will pay How much do you
want I will pay

Sirens can be heard Lights swirl outside the windows

ELLIOT
That’s the part you were wrong about
Rohit
(shrugs)
I was just fucking with you about the
money

FBI AGENTS race into the shop as Elliot breezes past them
heading out leaving the chaos to surround the destroyed Phil
INT NYC SUBWAY (MOVING) - MORNING

Back to present day Elliot snaps awake He eyes the two MEN
IN BLACK who still sneak looks at him

ELLIOT (VO)

Now I’m being followed The higher
ups don’t like someone with my
powers In three short minutes I
destroyed a mans business life
existence I deleted him--

On the far end of the packed train a blonde man YAWNS loudly
He looks like a disheveled Californian who’s been forced to
relocate He wears cargo pants and what looks like a gas
attendant shirt that reads Computer Repair With A Smile
Below it a logo reads MR ROBOT (40s)

He looks at Elliot with a stoner’s smile as he brushes his
scraggly beard Elliot doesn’t smile back Across the crowd of
people the man shouts

MR ROBOT
Hey sonny what’s happening

Elliot doesn’t answer Instead he looks away pretending he
didn’t hear him

MR ROBOT (CONT’D)
It’s an exciting time for the world
right now An exciting time

Mr Robot lies on his back returning to his homeless slumber
EXT NYC STREETS - LATER

Elliot walks through the crowded streets of New York
carefully avoiding the touch of other humans He carries a
huge bookbag on his back

INT ALLSAFE OFFICES - LATER

He walks into the modest offices of AllSafe Cybersecurity as
announced by the boring corporate logo

ELLIOT (VO)

But I’m only a vigilante hacker at
night By day I’m a hired one just
a regular cyber security engineer
employee number 0652

INT ALLSAFE OFFICES - GIDEON’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

The AllSafe boss GIDEON NORTON (40s) a bearded metrosexual

with adult braces sits while ANGELA (20s) a blonde girl-next-
door trapped in the prim and proper veneer of a private school

upbringing looks down at him sternly

ANGELA
Gideon I can do it

Not wanting to respond Gideon lets his attention get
distracted by Elliot He shouts through his glass doors

GIDEON
Elliot in here

Elliot nervously walks in curiously looking at Angela who
pretends he’s not even there Gideon passes a file to him

GIDEON (CONTD)
They were hacked again Last night

Elliot looks over the notes
ELLIOT
What am I looking at Is this the
code This was a RUDY attack

SUPER “RUDY Attack - Also known as R-U-Dead-Yet This tool

attacks by starving available sessions on the web server until

they die”

Concerned Gideon nods Elliot shakes his head impressed more

than he usually is

ELLIOT (CONTD)
This is awesome--

ANGELA
Gideon will you please answer me

GIDEON
(to Elliot)
You think that’s awesome This is
killing us Elliot

ANGELA
Gideon I’m not leaving--

GIDEON
Angela let’s just see how the
meeting goes today They’re getting
hacked every week now Who knows if
they’1l still even be with us

ELLIOT
Theyre coming in

Gideon’s look confirms it He looks at Elliot’s hoodie

GIDEON
What’d we say about the dress code

Elliot sheds his hoodie revealing an oversized button-downed
dress shirt underneath He hates it

GIDEON (CONTD)
(re file)
Look over that be ready this
afternoon

INT ALLSAFE OFFICES - HALLWAYS
Elliot and Angela walk out Elliot smells something on her

ELLIOT
Did you start smoking again

ANGELA
(ignores his question)
Did you not get my texts last night
I sent you exactly thirteen of them

ELLIOT
Yeah I’m sorry I couldn’t make it--

ANGELA

(looks at him)
You promised me that you would try
this time

FLASHBACK Last night Elliot nervously walks up to the
entrance of a packed bar Through the big windows outside he
sees Angela laughing smiling drinking with friends
Elliot’s hand goes for the door but his hand trembles--

ANGELA (CONTD)
Stop thinking about something else
when I’m talking to you I hate when
you do that

ELLIOT
Sorry I was thinking about work

ANGELA
Youre such a kiss-ass Maybe that’s
why Gideon loves you so much He
thanks me all the time for bringing
you in But for some reason I think
you secretly hate it here

ELLIOT (VO)
She was right I liked most of the
people but our business-- a cyber
security firm that protects
corporations-- not so much

ELLIOT
No it’s cool I like it here

ANGELA
I’m sorry I’m just in a bad mood
I’ve been late on my last two student
loan payments and I can’t get Gideon
to give me a raise--

A slick good-looking Persian named ALI (20s) walks up and
kisses Angela

ALI
(to Elliot)
Yo bud Missed you last night where
were you

ELLIOT
Gotta go Big meeting today

Elliot doesn’t wait for a response he disappears into the
maze of cubicles quickly

ALI
(to Angela)
Did you find out what happened

ANGELA
He said he was working

ALI
(not buying it)
Come on You have to talk to him--

ANGELA
(rolls her eyes)
We’re gonna be late for the staff
meeting

ALI
He can’t stand me and you know why
Angela I can’t have this kind of
negativity in my life--

Angela glares at him Ali points

ALI (CONT’D)
Exactly what I’m talking about

INT ALLSAFE OFFICES - CONFERENCE ROOM - LATER

A wide conference room filled to the brim with account
executives programmers and VPs

GIDEON
The recent hacks on their network
have been of grave concern not only
to them but to this company Let’s
make sure we’re on our A game this
afternoon But before we get into it
I hear we have a birthday to
celebrate

He gestures over to Angela who sheepishly smiles Everyone
starts singing happy birthday Cake is being passed around
Smiles all around from the nice folks that work at AllSafe

Elliot his seat pushed just a little further out than the
rest observes cautiously On the mounted TV in the corner
MSNBC is playing a clip from ex-Defense Secretary Leon
Panetta The conversation around him drowns out as he focuses
on the TV

LEON PANETTA
-theres a strong likelihood the
next Pearl Harbor we confront could
very well be a cyberattack

MSNBC ANCHOR
Panetta went on to say that this is
the future of US defense spending
computer engineers with expertise in
hacking This is the new soldier the
intelligence soldier

Elliot turns to his co-worker LLOYD (20s) a Chinese engineer
with a fro who talks openly with a mouth full of purple
frosting Elliot forces a smile as he passes on a piece of
cake

CUBICLE - LATER

Elliot’s cubicle is as vanilla as a cube could be He
furiously codes on a Linux command line earbuds plugged in
His fingers take quick breaks to fetch McDonald’s fries out of
the bag Ali interrupts his work with a wave of his hand and a
phony smile as icing Elliot reluctantly removes his earbuds

ALI
Yo man Wanna do lunch today

ELLIOT
Oh um yeah I have other pla--

ee

ALI
Plans yeah that’s what you said the
last three times I asked you Look
bud you and Angela have been close
for a long time But that’s even
more reason why I want us to be on
good terms I just feel like it’s
awkward between us don’t you

ELLIOT
I’m okay with it being awkward
between us

ALI
(scoffs)
Well it’s not okay with me Lunch
today Meet me at Sharon’s Deli at
115 On me It’1ll be epic

A moment’s hesitation then Elliot nods

ALI (CONT’D)
Cool bro

EXT NEW YORK STREETS - DAY

Elliot shiftlessly walks through the streets once again big
bookbag in tow His eyes wander around in paranoia He
continues to eat his McDonald’s fries from the bag

INT PSYCHOLOGIST’S OFFICE - DAY

He sits across from his psychologist KRISTA (40s) a slightly
overweight African-American woman who tries too hard at youth
with a short dress

They’re looking at each other in silence

KRISTA
What are you thinking about

ELLIOT
Nothing

KRISTA
Wanna know what I’m thinking about
(off his look)
The first time you came to me

ELLIOT (VO)
I didn’t exactly come to Krista I
was forced here But I do like her
(then)
Her password was simple Dylan2791
Favorite artist and the year in which
she was born backwards

e FH He

INSERT Krista’s Gmail Facebook iTunes We land on her
eharmony profile

ELLIOT (VO)
I know she got a divorce four years
ago I know she was devastated by it
and has been dating losers on
eharmony ever since

INSERT A profile pic of a salt and pepper handsome gent He’s
a pudgy nice fellow with a friendly mustache and a welcoming
smile His name is listed as Michael Hansen

ELLIOT (VO)
Her most recent foray Michael
Hansen Something about him bugs me
scratching that part of my mind
again

Back to the scene Elliot eyes Krista

ELLIOT (VO)
Though she’s a psychologist she’s
really bad at reading people But I’m
good at reading people My secret I
look for the worst in them

KRISTA
You were so angry You hated
everyone That’s what you said And I
told you you can’t change the system
by hating it Do you remember that

ELLIOT
I remember that

KRISTA
I know you’re not yelling like
before which is good But I can tell
youre still holding onto it We have
to deal with your anger issues
Elliot You’re angry at everyone at
society--

ELLIOT (VO)
Fuck society

KRISTA
You have a lot to be angry about but
keeping it to yourself staying quiet
like youre doing that’s not going
to help you There’s pain underneath
That’s where our work needs to go

Elliot says nothing Krista leans in

FF

Ft He

e ee

KRISTA (CONTD)
What is it about society that
disappoints you so much

Elliot holds back as his eyes wander to the Apple insignia
glowing off of Krista’s laptop on her desk

ELLIOT (VO)
Oh I don’t know is it that we
collectively thought Steve Jobs was a
great man even when we knew he made
billions off the backs of children

His eyes shift to the glass framed Tour De France poster
hanging on the wall featuring Lance Armstrong

ELLIOT (VO)
Or maybe it’s that it feels like all
our heroes are counterfeit the world
itself just one big hoax

His eyes refocus on the reflection of the glass frame seeing
that Krista’s browser from her laptop is on Twitter

ELLIOT (VO)
Spamming each other with our running
commentary of bullshit masquerading
as insight our social media faking
as intimacy

Krista still eyes Elliot waiting for him to respond He
returns his stare back at her noticing the “I voted” sticker
her on her blouse

ELLIOT (VO)
Or is it that we voted for this Not
with our rigged elections--

His eyes now notice the expensive accessories of Krista Her
earrings watch shoes her Hunger Games book on her desk

ELLIOT (VO)
But with our things our property
our money But I’m not saying
anything new We all know why we do
this Not because earrings or the
Hunger Games books makes us happier

Krista crosses her legs still waiting on Elliot to respond
That’s when Elliot spots a prescription bottle next to
Krista’s purse on her desk chair

ELLIOT (VO)
But because we want to be sedated
Because it’s painful not to pretend
Because we’re fucking cowards Fuck
society-- but I’ve said that already

He finally responds to Krista

ELLIOT
Nothing

Krista leans back frustrated she’s getting nowhere

ELLIOT (CONT’D)
Don’t be frustrated

KRISTA
(confused)
And why shouldn’t I be

ELLIOT
Youre different than most You at
least try you at least understand
KRISTA
(intrigued)

Understand what

ELLIOT

What it’s like to feel alone You
understand the pain You want to
protect people from it I respect
that about you

Long silence

KRISTA
Why do you think I know what it’s
like to feel alone

ELLIOT (VO)
(shocked realization)
Shit From her emails The dangers of
being a hacker have to be careful
not to ever slip about what you
shouldn’t know--

KRISTA
Elliot

Unsure of what to say Elliot stays quiet Krista lets it go

KRISTA (CONT’D)
Let’s talk about last night Did you
go to Angela’s birthday party

FLASHBACK Last night we pick up where we left off Elliot’s
hand trembles as he reaches for the door to the bar He sweats
as he closes his eyes and tries to force himself to go in but
can’t The door opens three people file out Elliot quickly
moves out of the way avoiding physical contact at all costs
He takes a breath and looks through the windows again

Fe Fe

i

Angela is happy surrounded by friends enjoying her birthday
Ali walks up to her They kiss This is enough for Elliot to
wrap his head in his hoodie and walk away--

Back to the scene

ELLIOT
Yeah It was nice
KRISTA
Did you try to talk to anyone
ELLIOT
Sure a few people I got a girl’s
number
KRISTA
(impressed)

You did Are you gonna call her

ELLIOT
I think so yeah She’s cute She
likes The Hunger Games

KRISTA

(back to being suspicious)
Youre hiding again When you hide
like this your delusions will come
back It’s a slippery slope Elliot

(off of his uneasy shift)
Let’s talk about the men in black you
were seeing Are they still there

ELLIOT
No I told you they’re gone The
meds you gave me helped

Krista doesn’t buy any of this
EXT NEW YORK STREETS - DAY

Elliot on his way back The MEN IN BLACK discreetly follow
him eyeing him suspiciously He’s so distracted by them that
he doesn’t notice Ali standing in his way

ALI
So where were you I waited half an
hour for you man

Still preoccupied with the MEN IN BLACK Elliot looks around
nervously but can’t spot them anymore

ALI (CONTD)

Why are you such a weirdo Elliot
This isn’t normal you know You
don’t just tell people you’re going
to be somewhere and then not show up

Elliot forces himself to nod in agreement

ELLIOT
You’re right that does seem counter-
intuitive

ALI
NOT cool bro Not cool
(then)
We’re going to Sharon’s Deli now

ELLIOT
But I ate already
(off his look VO)
Fuck me he’s not gonna let this go
INT SHARON’S DELI - DAY

The deli is busy with MANHATTANITES Ali and Elliot share a

couple of seats at the counter Ali is droning on and on about

something mundane Elliot looks absolutely miserable

ALI
--anyway my point is I think the
Beatles are okay but very overrated
you know I mean come on there are
lots of bands that are way better

ELLIOT
No I don’t agree with that at all

ALI
Well we can agree to disagree

He puts his arm on Elliot’s shoulder-- but Elliot not
comfortable with the physical contact brushes it away

ALI (CONT’D)
Sorry forgot about your touching
thing--
(a more sympathetic tone)
Look I love Angela and I want us to
try to get along for her sake--

As Ali drones on again Elliot’s stream of consciousness
interrupts

ELLIOT (VO)
Am I that crazy to hate this guy so
much Among some of his Facebook
likes are--

INSERT Ali’s Facebook likes George W Bush’s Decision
Points the movie Transformers 2 Revenge of the Fallen and
the music of Josh Groban

ELLIOT (VO)
I’ve also witnessed the first of many
flirtations with Stella B

the scene Ali’s still in the midst of his phony plea

ELLIOT (VO)
I’ve thought about telling Angela
but she has shitty taste in men and
I’m not quite ready to see what comes
after this just yet Plus I can
manage Ali easier than the others
For now anyway

ALI
but that’s all I mean I just want
you to know that I like you bro
And I want you to like me too

ELLIOT
I understand Ali I’1l try harder

ALI
That’s cool man Whenever you’re
ready I’d love to justchill--

Elliot’s phone buzzes He looks at it His eyes grow wide

ELLIOT
Weve gotta go back Theyre here

INT ALLSAFE OFFICES - CUBICLE - LATER

Elliot types away at his computer

ELLIOT (VO)
Truth is I shouldn’t hate Ali He’s
not that bad a guy

ELLIOT (VO) (CONTD)
He’s too dumb to be bad In fact
when I think about the really bad
people

As if sensing it Elliot stands and peeks out of his cubicle
He sees Gideon greeting a handful of business SUITS at the
front Angela is among the AllSafe greeters They navigate the
SUITS towards the conference room

ELLIOT (VO)
BEEP Corp

BEEP -— (whenever the name of the company’s mentioned it is
bleeped out)

ELLIOT (VO)
But they might as well be called Evil
Corp In fact after a thorough
intensive self-reprogramming that’s
all my mind hears sees or reads when
they pop up in my world Krista would
have a shit fit if she knew I did
that But that’s what they are

INSERT Evil Corp’s logo which looks like the Enron “E” logo

ELLIOT (VO)
A conglomerate of Evil

VIDEO Laptops desktops smartphones nuclear power plants
guns farms cereal microwaves pills all sporting the Evil
Corp logo

ELLIOT (VO)
It isn’t just that they indirectly
killed or injured close to a million
people in the last ten years

Back to the scene Angela flashes a smile at Elliot before
closing the shades of the conference room

ELLIOT (VO)
It’s that they have no conscience
about it They’re a perfect monster

Elliot sits back down

ELLIOT (VO)
And now I have to help them--

Gideon and the team of SUITS walk up next to Elliot’s cubicle

Elliot sneaks a peek at the head suit a bald guy who’s a dead
ringer for Steve Ballmer

ELLIOT (VO)
There he is Terry Colby the CTO

TERRY COLBY looks around with a doofus smile

ELLIOT (VO)
Even though he’s the head technology
guy at one of the biggest companies
in the world he owns a Blackberry

Elliot’s eyes shift to Terry’s Blackberry on his belt Terry
looks at Elliot’s desktop with confusion

ELLIOT (VO)
It also looks like he doesn’t see a
Linux operating system too often
He’s not a techie He’s a moron

The suits led by Gideon keep on walking through the office

ELLIOT (VO)
An arrogant moron The worst kind

Elliot goes to sit down but a person from the pack walks up
to him He’s good-looking sharply dressed and has a rock star
smile His name is TYRELL WELLICK (30s) He reaches his hand
out to Elliot Elliot painfully takes it

TYRELL
(thick Swedish accent)
Tyrell Wellick Senior Vice
President technology Evil Corp--

Elliot quickly takes his hand back Tyrell notices

ELLIOT
I’mElliot Just a tech

TYRELL

Don’t be so humble I started exactly
where you are To be honest my heart
has always stayed there

(looking at his screen)
Oh I see you’re running Ubuntu

(off of Elliot’s impressed

look)
I’m on Red Hat myself I know the
desktop manager is better on here
but old habits die hard

ELLIOT (VO)
An executive running Linux But--

TYRELL
I know what you’re thinking I’m an
executive why am I running Linux
Again old habits die hard

Elliot uncomfortably smiles

TYRELL (CONTD)
Lookin’ forward to working with you
I should join the rest of the group
Bonsoir Elliot

He takes off with an earnest smile

Elliot sits back down in his cubicle with a resigned sigh He
takes in his small three-walled cube universe amidst the
thirty other identical cubes

ELLIOT (VO)
Sometimes I dream of saving everyone
from the invisible hand

Elliot eyes his fellow employees sympathetically all looking
like enslaved serfs with their company badges hanging off
them

ELLIOT (VO)
The one that brands us with an
employee badge

His eyes look over at Lloyd who is busy paying a Verizon bill
online He shakes his head angrily at the price

ELLIOT (VO)
The one that forces us to work for
them

EXT NYC STREETS - NIGHT

Elliot walks through the streets alone as GROUPS OF FRIENDS
laugh while walking in and out of bars Credit cards are
swiped dollar-tips are thrown a homeless man begs for
change

ELLIOT (VO)
The one that controls us everyday
without us knowing it But I can’t
stop it I’m not that special I’m
just anonymous I’m just alone

INT ELLIOT’S LOFT - NIGHT

Elliot enters his messy small loft A black cat named QWERTY
greets him at the door

ELLIOT (VO)
If it weren’t for Qwerty I’d be
completely empty

She MEOWS
MOMENTS LATER

Qwerty is chowing down on cat food Elliot lies on the floor
next to her petting her while she eats He starts crying
hysterically

ELLIOT (VO)
I hate when I can’t hold in my
loneliness-- this crying has been
happening too often every other week
now What do normal people do when
they get this sad They reach out to
friends or family I think

INT ELLIOT’S LOFT - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

Elliot crushes up morphine pills He puts the crushed powder
on a small glass table and cuts it with a credit card

ELLIOT (VO)
I do morphine I can’t make friends
And family--

INT ELLIOT’S HOUSE (FLASHBACK) - DAY

A YOUNG ELLIOT sits at the kitchen table His MOTHER
(30s) pretty but cold Buttoned up a short haircut and
expressionless face She methodically smokes a cigarette

Young Elliot looks like he’s been scolded His mother grabs
his arm digging her nails in until it bleeds He goes to
scream--

ELLIOT (VO)
That’s not an option

INT ELLIOT’S LOFT - MOMENTS LATER

Elliot snorts up a line of morphine He lies back down on the
floor as it takes effect Qwerty plops on his stomach and
watches him He smiles

ELLIOT (VO)
The key to doing morphine without
turning into a junkie is to limit
yourself to 30mg a day Anything more
just builds up your tolerance I
check every pill I get for purity I
have 8mg Suboxone for maintenance in
case I go through withdrawals--

e HF

Elliot’s eyes grow wide He sits up slowly

ELLIOT (V0O)
Shit

He stands and goes to the nightstand by his bed He goes into
his Altoids can and realizes with annoyance its empty

He takes a deep breath and pulls out his Evil Corp smartphone
Through the cracked screen we see his texts

ELLIOT Are you home

SHAYLA Yeah R U

ELLIOT I’m out of my pills Can I pick some up
SHAYLA B up in a sec

MOMENTS LATER

SHAYLA (30s) a tatted hipster girl sits across from Elliot
She fingers out a baggie full of orange pills

SHAYLA
You never tell me what these are for

ELLIOT
(ignoring her)
How much

SHAYLA
On the house

ELLIOT
No Shayla not doing that This is
just a regular drug deal like it
always is

Elliot offers her cash Shayla resigns herself and takes it

SHAYLA
What are you up to tonight I was
gonna post a party thing on your
Facebook but you still didn’t create
an account I thought you said you
were going to

ELLIOT

I never said I was going to
SHAYLA

Why not
ELLIOT

Because I hate Facebook

SHAYLA
(offended)
That’s crazy

Elliot shoots her a look “I guess I’m crazy” Disappointed
Shayla pulls out two white pills from her pocket

SHAYLA (CONTD)
Wanna do these together then My
dealer says Lena Dunham buys them all
the time They’re pure Molly

The last line piques Elliot’s interest though his look is
already regretting the decision

INT ELLIOT’S LOFT - LATER

Elliot lies naked in his bed smoking a joint while a nude
Shayla lies next to him fast asleep He wears a dumb look

ELLIOT (VO)
Don’t ever make decisions when you’re
on morphine

His cell beeps He looks at it

ELLIOT (VO)
Foursquare check-in for Krista at Bar
None It’s Friday night It has to be
with Michael I’ve gotta go to work

He puts on clothes and looks at Qwerty
ELLIOT
(re Shayla)
Keep an eye on her while I’m gone

EXT BAR NONE - NIGHT
Elliot in a hoodie walks by Bar None across the street He
doesn’t walk towards it instead he stays put lurking around
the corner He pulls out his phone and uses the camera to zoom
in through the bar’s big windows

The camera finally lands on Krista and Michael dancing
Michael’s goofy moves make Krista laugh

EXT BAR NONE - AWHILE LATER

Elliot’s camera is still on Michael from across the street as
he watches him kiss Krista goodbye They part ways

Elliot follows close behind as Michael walks through the
streets Michael hails a cab Elliot snaps a picture of the
number on top of Michael’s cab as it takes off

He quickly pulls out his cell phone and dials

ELLIOT

(into the phone)

Yes hi I think I left my keys in
one of your cabs--

(looking at the picture)
Number 876496 yes I have like a
photographic memory thing yeah
I’1l hold

Elliot looks around the city block he’s standing on In the
distance a late night diner shows two MEN IN BLACK having
coffee Elliot hides behind a bus stop watching them

Suddenly the MR ROBOT bum from the subway walks up to their
table begging for money Elliot shoots a confused look-- but
gets interrupted when the operator returns

ELLIOT (CONT’D)
350 Hawthorne Avenue Thanks

He hangs up and returns his gaze back to the two MEN IN BLACK
Mr Robot is nowhere to be seen He lets it go for now and
returns to the task at hand

EXT 350 HAWTHORNE AVENUE - LATER

Elliot walks up and sees the cab waiting by the curb On the
stoop in front of 350 Hawthorne Michael smokes a cigarette as
he begrudgingly walks his dog It’s as if Michael has
completely dropped his cheery nice guy act

MICHAEL
Come on asshole piss already

He kicks the dog causing him to YELP
Elliot charges from across the street

The cowed dog looks up sheepishly at Michael as it nervously
paces around the small patch of grass

MICHAEL (CONTD)
Fucking GO

He goes to kick the dog again when Elliot finally gets there--

ELLIOT
Hey

Michael stops and turns Elliot looks at the dog with
sympathy but then back at Michael

ELLIOT (CONT’D)
Can I borrow your phone Mine’s dead
and I need to call my mom

Michael reluctantly nods and pulls out his cell He slides it
unlocked with his passcode and hands it to him

Elliot takes it immediately memorizing all the apps on his
homescreen specifically the Wells Fargo app

He dials his own number and calls From within Elliot’s back
pocket we see his phone light up and vibrate

The cab finally tired of waiting peels out The driver
loudly SWEARS to himself about the waste of time

Elliot gets his own voicemail He hangs up quickly deletes
his call log and looks back at Michael

ELLIOT (CONT’D)
No answer Thanks anyway

Michael takes his phone back with a shrug
EXT NYC SUBWAY - LATER

Elliot walks out of the subway station smoking a joint His
phone immediately vibrates He looks at it with a question
then answers

ELLIOT
Angela Everything okay
INTERCUT WITH

INT ALLSAFE OFFICES - CUBICLE

Angela stands apart from Lloyd who is desperately trying to
tackle a tech issue on his desktop

ANGELA
(into the phone)
No it’s not Are you home Were you
asleep I’ve been trying you for
fifteen minutes

ELLIOT
I was in the subway What’s going on

ANGELA
(discreet
I need you to come to AllSafe

ww

ELLIOT
You’re there It’s three in the
morning

ANGELA

They hacked into Evil’s servers
again But it’s bad this time It’s a
DoS attack

SUPER “DoS Attack - A Denial of Service attack an attempt to
make a machine or network unavailable to its intended users”

ANGELA (CONTD)
All their sites are down the store
the corporate email phone system
everything

ELLIOT
Did you call Lloyd He’s on call--

ANGELA
Yeah he’s here

Lloyd slaps himself out of frustration as he types

ELLIOT
Is he talking to Evil’s tech
department

ANGELA

He’s online with them but so far
nothing This is bad Elliot It’s
been down for almost an hour

(lowered voice)
I don’t think Lloyd can fix this
Look Gideon just put me on this
account I can’t fuck up the first
week I need you Please

Elliot looks back into the subway He tosses his joint
INT NYC SUBWAY (MOVING) - NIGHT

Elliot sits in his usual place staring ahead thinking-- but
for the first time he looks perplexed

INT ALLSAFE OFFICES - NIGHT

Elliot races in Angela walks up to him panicking

ELLIOT
Anything
ANGELA
No I called Gideon
ELLIOT
Why It’s only been down for an hour
and a half
ANGELA

Yeah well an hour and a half in
Evil Corp’s time is like 13 million
dollars in revenue Approximately I
lied actually I calculated that
That’s exactly how much they lost

ELLIOT
Don’t worry I got this

They approach Lloyd who is sweating bullets in his cubicle

ELLIOT (CONT’D)
Lloyd what’s the deal

No response Lloyd is locked in on his terminal

ELLIOT (CONTD)

Lloyd
Lloyd snaps out of his trance and looks at Elliot

LLOYD
Elliot This is bad

ELLIOT
What’s happening

LLOYD
We’ve got server overloads on all of
them not just the web servers

ELLIOT
That doesn’t make any sense Most of
the servers aren’t even exposed Shut
down all the ports on 80--

LLOYD
I did that already I think they
might have gotten behind the
switches

ELLIOT
Wait a minute I thought this was
just a DoS attack

LLOYD
Dude this is fucked is what this is

ELLIOT
I’m gonna login

Biggie’s “Somebody’s Gotta Die” RISES on the soundtrack as
Elliot types furiously on his desktop navigating Evil Corp’s
servers The music continues throughout this sequence as we--

INTERCUT WITH

INT KRISTA’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Krista walks into her clean Ikea-furnished apartment with a
drunken smile pasted on her face She mumbles to herself

KRISTA
Dont fall in love honey come on
Its still early But it feels good
it definitely feels--

Her phone beeps with a text She excitedly takes it out

KRISTA (CONTD)
Oh God is that him

MICHAEL I miss u
She smiles as she types in a flirtatious response back
INT ALLSAFE OFFICES - NIGHT

Elliot finishes a can of Red Bull as he switches terminal
windows typing furiously

INT ALI’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Ali is in his boxers studiously watching THE SECRET on DVD
and writing notes on a legal pad His laptop flashes a Skype
alert Stella B pops up on the screen He grins

INT ALLSAFE OFFICES - NIGHT

Elliot types away as Gideon walks in Even though he’s angry
he keeps his cool He sees Elliot then faces Angela

GIDEON
Status update-- what the fuck is
going on

ELLIOT
Someone’s taken down their servers

GIDEON
Where is it coming from

ELLIOT
Everywhere USA Finland Thailand
Kuwait I can’t trace them They got
behind the switches somehow They’re
sending large numbers of IP packets
to everything Evil Corp’s entire
network is crashing in on itself

GIDEON
Swap out the switches

Elliot continues to type as he takes his orders

ELLIOT (VO)
But if I were these guys I’d know
that and have a rootkit sitting on
the firewall sending out attacks
internally--

Elliot hits a few keystrokes hard and looks to Lloyd

ELLIOT
Mine are swapped

LLOYD
One and two are swapped

Angela jumps on a computer and tries to go to Evil Corp’s
website

ANGELA
Still down

INT KRISTA’S APARTMENT - NIGHT
Krista is in her robe reading another text--
MICHAEL I couldn’t resist

Her DOORBELL goes off She opens the door and Michael is
standing there with flowers He passionately kisses her

INT ALLSAFE OFFICES - NIGHT

GIDEON
What about the firewall

ELLIOT
I think

Elliot taps on his computer slower now as he thinks

GIDEON
What

ELLIOT
I think they put a rootkit in the
firewall

SUPER “Rootkit - A set of software tools with administrator-
level access to a computer or network”

It starts to register to Gideon that this is bad Very bad

ANGELA
What’s a rootkit

LLOYD
It’s like a crazy serial rapist with
a very big dick

ANGELA
Jesus Lloyd

LLOYD
Sorry It’s malicious code that takes
over the operating system

LLOYD (CONTD)
It can delete system files or worse
install programs viruses worms
anything it wants

ANGELA
How do we stop it

LLOYD
That’s the thing it can make itself
invisible They’re almost impossible
to find

INT TYRELL WELLICK’S SUBURBAN HOME - NIGHT

Tyrell Wellick snaps awake as his phone rings violently He
looks at the caller ID but isn’t pleased

TYRELL WELLICK
(in Swedish subtitles)
Yes Is it absolutely necessary

His Filipino pregnant wife JOANNA (30s) also stirs awake

JOANNA
Babe

TYRELL WELLICK
Shut up go to sleep

Tyrell gets out of bed fully nude and leaves the bedroom
LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Still naked he stands in front of his massive 70” Plasma TV
FOX News is reporting with a banner “EVIL CORP’S NETWORK
SUFFERS MAJOR OUTAGE”

Tyrell isn’t fazed by this

TYRELL WELLICK
(in Swedish subtitles)
Yes I see it they’ve failed
before they’re more than welcome to
fail again

INT ALLSAFE OFFICES - NIGHT

Angela scans all the headlines on the news websites then
looks over to Gideon

ANGELA
They’re starting to report about the
outage

GIDEON
(to Elliot)
Swap out the firewall again

ELLIOT

(typing away)
Every time I swap a server load over
to another firewall the rootkit
replicates itself before I take the
bad one down

(then)
Its defending itself

Everyone exchanges tense looks

GIDEON
What’s next

ELLIOT
(thinks )
The only thing we can do iswe have
to deliberately crash the system

A moment as the harrowing thought sinks in Then Gideon
carefully unplugs a printer picks it up and smashes it
through one of the windows of the conference room

INT KRISTA’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

They’ve moved to the bedroom clothes are off as Krista climbs
on top of Michael She closes her eyes savoring the moment

INT EVIL CORP HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT

engineers and Tyrell Wellick

TERRY COLBY
Why do we have to shut down the whole
network Who’s on this

TYRELL
We have AllSafe heading to our main
server farm in Virginia

TERRY COLBY
AllSafe Aren’t they here

TYRELL
Were flying one of their engineers
out on the company jet

TERRY COLBY
Too much time Just have one of our
guys out in Virginia do it--

TYRELL
To be honest sir I don’t trust them

TERRY COLBY
And why is that

TYRELL
(pause)
Gut instinct

INT PRIVATE JET (MOVING) - NIGHT

Elliot and Gideon sit silently in a small private Evil Corp
jet Evil Corp SECURITY sit on either side of the plane

INT ALI’S APARTMENT

Ali’s late night video chat with Stella B gets interrupted
when he sees a text from Angela He browses to Google News and
sees the headline CRIPPLING HACKER ATTACK BRINGS DOWN EVIL
CORP He logs off with Stella and calls Angela

INT SERVER FARM - NIGHT

Elliot speed-walks into the loud WHIRRING of the large arrays
of servers He finds a console and terminals in

GIDEON
Where is it

Elliot rapidly types

ELLIOT
Row 7A

Both of them race through the rows of servers until they find
it Elliot scans the arrays until he sees the right stack of
firewalls He places his fingers on the Ethernet cables then
nervously pauses

ELLIOT (CONT’D)
Here we go

Elliot starts ripping the cables out--
INT KRISTA’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Krista climaxes It’s amazing She slowly lies next to him
quivering with emotion She looks at him dotingly

KRISTA
I love you

He kisses her--

INT SERVER FARM - NIGHT

Gideon nervously paces around the pulled firewalls that are
stacked up in a pile on the floor Elliot is typing furiously
as he configures the newly installed firewalls A group of
tech SPECTATORS have now formed around Elliot watching him
with anticipation

GIDEON
(discreet)
Come on Elliot they’ve been down
for six hours--

ELLIOT
Hold ontry it now

Gideon tries the Evil Corp website It’s back up Gideon
breathes a sigh of relief

ELLIOT (CONTD)
Wait ask Angela We need to see if
it’s back up in the outside world

Gideon video conferences Angela through his laptop

ANGELA
(smiles )
We’re good on our end guys

The song comes to an end as the commotion finally subsides
The spectators CLAP Gideon stands up proudly and squeezes
Elliot’s shoulder Elliot shies away from the contact

ELLIOT
I still have to finish the
configuration Give me a minute

GIDEON
(put off)
Okay I’1l meet you by the bathrooms

The spectators disperse along with Gideon Elliot continues to
furiously type

ELLIOT (VO)
They must have left a mark or
something Every hacker loves to
gloat They don’t just do DoS attacks
for no reason

That’s when Elliot stumbles upon a file in the terminal that
reads simply fsociety

He dir’s it and a flurry of files go flying by the last one
being READMETXT He opens it It reads simply leavemehere

ELLIOT (VO)
This was the rootkit Fsociety Is
that supposed to be a joke

Elliot steps out of the directory and types rm fsociety He
takes a pause before hitting enter

ELLIOT (VO)
Wait This note is for me They’re
telling me to leave it here But why

Techs walk by nervously surprising Elliot He can’t bring
himself to delete it-- he closes the terminal and walks away

INT PRIVATE JET (MOVING) - DAWN

Exhausted Elliot and Gideon sit silently together Though
Elliot is used to the all-nighters Gideon isn’t He has a
glass of wine as he sits back deep in thought

GIDEON
Did you know that I was gay

ELLIOT
Umno

After an awkward pause Gideon uncomfortably nods

GIDEON
Consider this me coming out to you
then okay It’s hard because I
don’t like to talk about my sex life
But my partner-- he gets very
paranoid he thinks I’m ashamed of--
you know He wants me to be more
public about it Anyway I’m gay

ELLIOT
(awkward pause)
Thanks

Deep in thought again Gideon slowly sips his wine Elliot
notices the troubled look on his face

ELLIOT (CONT’D)
Don’t worry about it Hackers have a
short attention span They’1l get
bored and harass someone else--

GIDEON
Evil Corp is thinking about leaving
And I don’t know if I blame them

Gideon shakes his head

ELLIOT
We have other clients

GIDEON
We had other clients Everyones
slashing their budgets doing
security internally Evil Corp is
seventy percent of our business right
now We can’t lose them I’m already
extended on our credit line If we
lose them that’s gonna be it for us
That’s gonna be it for me

Gideon takes another sip of his wine and leans back in his
chair He looks up hopeless unsettled He looks over

GIDEON (CONTD)
I feel like I can talk to you More
than the others anyway

They share a comfortable moment this time

GIDEON (CONTD)
I’m sure in a strange way youll be
happy if we went under
(off his look)
Oh come on I know you hate the
stupid meetings the birthday cake
wearing that shirt everyday

As Gideon lists off the things he supposedly hates Elliot
finds himself sincerely worried he’1ll lose them

ELLIOT
Gideon
(off his look)
I promise I’1ll find them

INT NYC SUBWAY (MOVING) - DAY

Elliot’s drained face stares stoically out trying to piece
together the mystery of the recent hacks He shakes his head
sadly

ELLIOT (VO)
I’1l Google fsociety when I get home
I’ve never seen their name on the
boards though They’ve gotta be new
But they’re good--

Elliot’s train of thought is interrupted when Mr Robot sits
across from him donning the same gas attendant shirt

MR ROBOT
Rough night

e eH

Fe

Shocked Elliot’s eyes grow large

MR ROBOT (CONTD)
I’m gonna leave on the next stop I
think you should come with me
(puts on a ski cap)
But only if you didn’t delete it If
you deleted it then we have nothing
to talk about

Mr Robot stands and waits by the doors Elliot sits there
paralyzed not knowing what to do at all

ELLIOT
Are you talking to me

Mr Robot says nothing but the empty car states the obvious

The subway finally screeches to a halt Elliot stands as it
stops Mr Robot walks off the subway Elliot stands there for
a moment wondering if he should follow him He does

PLATFORM - CONTINUOUS

Mr Robot sits on the other side of the station Elliot slowly
walks over and sits next to him

ELLIOT (CONT’D)
Who are you

MR ROBOT
We’re gonna wait for the Q

ELLIOT
And then what

MR ROBOT
And then we’re gonna go to Brooklyn
out by Coney Island

ELLIOT
Why What’s there

MR ROBOT
Of course you’re gonna ask a lot of
questions It’s weird what you’re
doing right now I get that Thing
is I can’t tell you anything until
we get there

Mr Robot pulls out a cigarette and lights it

ELLIOT
I don’t think you can smoke in here
(Mr Robot ignores him)
You’ve been following me Why What
do you want from me

MR ROBOT

My dad was a petty thief Never could
hold down a job So he just robbed
convenience stores shops small-time
stuff One time he sat me down and
told me something that I never
forgot He said “Everyone steals
that’s how it works You think people
out there are getting exactly what
they deserve No They’re either
getting paid over or under someone
in the chain always gets bamboozled
I steal but I don’t get caught
that’s the contract I have with
society If you can catch me
stealing I’1ll go to jail If you
can’t then I earn the money”

(then)
I respected that shit man As a
little kid I thought that was
fucking cool But a few years after
that they finally caught him and he
goes to jail Leaves three kids and a
wife with no money Dies five years
after that my respect goes with him
I thought my dad was free doing what
he did He wasn’t He was in prison

(looks at Elliot)
Just like you are now Elliot But
I’m about to break you out

Elliot shoots him a quiet puzzled look Mr Robot puts on a
pair of sunglasses smiles big and then stares ahead

EXT CONEY ISLAND - STREETS - DAY

An impoverished ghetto block Elliot cautiously follows Mr
Robot down the street An old Ferris wheel can be seen slowly
spinning in the distance

They finally reach a rundown boarded up arcade The sign
reads FUN SOCIETY ARCADE (but the U and N are faded) Mr
Robot walks up to the door and grabs the key from under a dead
plant He walks to the back gesturing Elliot to follow him

THE BACK - CONTINUOUS
Mr Robot opens the backdoor Blue green and gray Ethernet

cables run from all sides of the door The sound of KEYBOARD
STROKES and CHATTER emanate from within

Mr Robot walks in Elliot follows

Why would you guys actually meet IRL

SUPER “IRL - In Real Life”

None of them look up all of them with earbuds plugged in as
they type away A Depeche Mode song plays over the loud
speaker Mr Robot gestures for Elliot to follow him around
the corner into the kitchen He makes himself a glass of beer
from the tap

MR ROBOT
Remember LulzSec

SUPER “LulzSec - A computer hacker group that claimed
responsibility for several high profile attacks”

MR ROBOT (CONTD)

They got outed by their own leader to
the FBI and six hackers went to
prison for it How do you think they
got ‘em They went into the dude’s
computers and tracked all of them
down through e-mails VPN sessions
chat messages texts-- one guy and
everything goes down It’s what you

call--
ELLIOT
A central point of failure
MR ROBOT
(smiles )

Right Because they didn’t meet in
person they compromised each other
every time they sent so much as a
fucking smiley face The rule here
is it’s done here and only here It
ends when you walk out that door and
begins when you walk in Our
encryption is the real world

ELLIOT
How do you talk to each other then

Mr Robot walks over to the popcorn machine and starts eating
straight out of it

MR ROBOT
We don’t We come and go work on the

How do you trust them

MR ROBOT
I have them do an exercise If they
pass they become one of us If they
fail

Mr Robot takes off his jacket as he smiles yes Elliot peers
back to the hackers

ELLIOT (CONTD)
You said there was a project What’s
the project

MR ROBOT
(nods )
Well get to all of that I just
wanted you to meet the crew and show
you the place

They walk back into the main room Mr Robot sits down with
the hackers puts his earbuds in and slaps on a pair of
sunglasses He picks up a beast of an Evil Corp laptop and
begins typing away Elliot stands there unsure of how to
proceed

Don’t fuck with me I wrote that
rootkit I still have to run the IP
trace back to Colby’s laptop
(off his confused look)
You really don’t know what I’m
talking about

Marlene shakes her head with disgust and flicks her cigarette

MARLENE (CONTD)
Dickhead

She gets up and walks towards the back leaving Elliot
perplexed Mr Robot enters from the street through the gate
holding a grocery bag full of goodies

MR ROBOT
Elliot I scored the last batch of
twinkies at Gristedes Want one

ELLIOT
She just called me a dickhead

MR ROBOT
(smiles )

Yeah that’s Marlene
(gestures toward the
Ferris wheel)

Hey you like Ferris wheels

EXT CONEY ISLAND - FERRIS WHEEL - DAY

Elliot and Mr Robot stand in a slow-moving empty Ferris
wheel car as it does its circular motion up Mr Robot looks
down at the sparse crowd with a grin eating a twinkie

ELLIOT
I’m here to tell you that I’m turning
you in I’m giving them the IP and
mac address plus the logs--

MR ROBOT
Let me tell you why you’re really
here
Confused Elliot says nothing

Mr

MR ROBOT (CONTD)

You’re here because you sense
something wrong with the world
Something you can’t explain but you
know it controls you and everyone you
care about It turns them into
slaves And that angers you

ELLIOT
What are you talking about

MR ROBOT
Money Money hasn’t been real ever
since we got off the gold standard

(turns to Elliot)

It’s become virtual Software The
operating system of our world And
the rules are simple those who have
less of it are forever subjugated to
those who have more of it

ELLIOT
Money Is that what you and your
little family back there do Steal
money

MR ROBOT
(offended)
This isn’t the mafia We’re not a
family Family members trust each
other and that’s what usually fucks
them This isn’t about trust it’s
about freedom

ELLIOT

Any of those guys back there can call
the cops on you anytime Fuck they
can call the cops on me

MR ROBOT

They’d do that whether I trusted them
or not They’re selfish just like
everyone else They’re gonna always
do what’s in their best interest and
as long as I know that everyone’s on
the level Right now it would be in
no one’s interest to call the cops
Not when we’re this close

ELLIOT
Close To what

Robot’s smile returns
MR ROBOT
Well Elliot we’re on the verge of
taking down this virtual reality
(gestures outside)
The one out there

ELLIOT
(long stare)
Are you crazy Is that what this is
Are you some crazy rich man that’s on
mescaline or something--

MR ROBOT
It’s pure economics What if you took
down one conglomerate-- a
conglomerate so deeply entrenched in
the world economy that too big to
fail doesn’t even come close to
describing it

ELLIOT
(skeptical)
Doesn’t exist They’d find some way
around it they always do--

MR ROBOT

We’ve run the simulations Even in
the best case scenarios this
conglomerate’s collapse couldn’t be
saved

(eats another twinkie)
And if this conglomerate goes down
wellit’d be a domino effect Every
crony partner company dependent on
them would fall shortly after Their
bought governments after that In
eight months their entire empire
would be erased from history

ELLIOT
You want to create another financial
meltdown Like the one we just had
but way worse Why would I want that
Everyone would lose their money--

MR ROBOT
What if I were to say that this same
conglomerate also happens to own
seventy percent of the global
consumer credit industry That if we
hit their data centers right we
could systematically format all the
servers including backup--

ELLIOT
That would erase--

MR ROBOT
All the debt we owe them Every
record of every credit card loan and
mortgage-- wiped clean Without a
single digital trace it’d be
impossible to reinforce outdated
paper records It’ll be gone-- the
biggest single instance of wealth
redistribution in history

Elliot realizes what he’s talking about To underline this he
sees an Evil Corp logo proudly displayed on top of a building
in the horizon

Mr

ELLIOT
The conglomerate This is about Evil
Corp
(off his look)
That’s why you picked me Because I
work at AllSafe

Robot hands him a slip of paper with an IP address

MR ROBOT
Tomorrow AllSafe is going to get a
visit from the FBI and the US Cyber
Command Put this IP trace on the
rootkit with the diagnostics you give
them Trenton found Colby’s encrypted
laptop address from Facebook

ELLIOT
You wanna frame Terry Colby for the
hack No one’s gonna believe that I
met him he’s a moron

MR ROBOT
So are the FBI Even if they don’t
believe he did it they’1ll believe he
gave someone access to it

ELLIOT
But he’1l just go to jail What will
that do

MR ROBOT

You don’t take down a conglomerate by
shooting them once in the heart
That’s the thing about conglomerates
they don’t have hearts You take them
down limb by limb And once they
unravel

(gestures out to the

people)
Their illusion of control goes with
it
49

Elliot takes a hard look at Mr Robot questioning his
seemingly altruistic motives

ELLIOT
Who are you

Mr Robot lights a cigarette

MR ROBOT
That’ll all come later You have a
lot to think about it You have to
turn in that report tomorrow and
Colby’s IP trace has to be in it You
do that and you will have set in
motion the biggest revolution the
world will ever see

Elliot’s look of doubt is all but whittled away

ELLIOT
What if I get caught

MR ROBOT
If you can get caught then youre
not good enough to do this

ELLIOT
(challenged but confident)
What makes you think I would do this
anyway What makes you think I give a
shit about Evil Corp

Mr Robot nods fair question He lifts himself up on the old
Ferris wheel car as it squeaks loudly He stands on the edge
holding onto the sides as it swings high above

ELLIOT (CONTD)
What are you doing--

MR ROBOT
I know you feel pain Elliot I know
you feel loneliness We all do It’s
not our fault We want the pain to
stop Not the bullshit pain people
cry about on blogs but real pain--

Mr Robot lets go of one of the sides as he looks down below
at the hard pavement The OPERATOR down below sees Mr Robot

OPERATOR
Hey What are you doing Are you
crazy

MR ROBOT

GO FUCK YOURSELF

ee eH

OPERATOR
ASSHOLE

Mr Robot closes his eyes as he ponders jumping He’s
immediately filled with emotion

MR ROBOT
I’m so fucking tired of our only
options being to put our heads down
or get knocked the fuck down--

Mr Robot tears up from the deep sadness He turns to face
Elliot letting go of both sides balancing himself with only
his legs as the old car swings A small crowd has now formed
below to watch the impending jumper

MR ROBOT (CONTD)
I want my head up I want to see the
world for the first time not through
their eyes not what they allow me to
see but what I want to see--

The Ferris wheel starts its decline as the infuriated operator
hurriedly tries to bring it back Mr Robot’s balance wavers
as the car moves He slips and almost falls back--

The crowd gasps as they point--
Mr Robot reaches for the side of the car but can’t grab it--

Elliot leaps forward and grabs Mr Robot’s hand Mr Robot
holds his hand It’s a rare moment of human contact for
Elliot and it’s powerful Mr Robot climbs back into the car
with a smile

MR ROBOT (CONTD)

I know you know what I’m talking
about It’s the part of you that
didn’t delete the rootkit It’s that
part of you that told you to come
back here It’s that part of you that
hates Evil Corp for killing your
father

Elliot is speechless
MR ROBOT (CONT’D)
Put that fucking IP trace in the
diagnostic tomorrow
The ride finally finishes Their carriage returns
MR ROBOT (CONT’D)

(eats another twinkie)
Looks like our ride is over

INT CONEY ISLAND STREETS - LATER

Elliot walks fast as a small smile begins to grow on his face
He listens to Neil Diamond’s “If You Go Away” He stops short
to see a billboard of a college student with a sad face The
copy reads “How am I ever going to pay back my student
loans” Underneath EVIL CORP

skipping around HuffPost - Mortgage lenders now have more
equity in US homes than Americans BBC - The global gap
between rich and poor is at its highest level for 20 years and
growing NY TIMES - Debt Slavery The New American Dream

He pulls up another browser window and logs into Citibank’s
site We see that the account belongs to Angela He clicks
through her statements and lands on her private Evil Corp
student loans She owes 19745564

Elliot looks over at Mr Robot’s slip of paper next to him He
opens a new command-line and begins typing up the report

MOMENTS LATER

The final pages of the new diagnostic report prints out He
places the report in a red manila envelope

Faintly smiling Elliot sleeps soundly in his bed The E logo
of Elliot’s Evil Corp desktop pulses in sleep mode casting a
shadow on Elliot periodically

INT NYC SUBWAY - PLATFORM - LATER

As Elliot waits for the subway he stares at a poster for a
blockbuster movie called VILLAINS the tagline reads Evil

The MEN IN BLACK on the platform sneak Elliot looks Elliot’s
excitement from the night before starts a slow descent

INT ALLSAFE OFFICES - NEXT MORNING

WORKERS file in for another day but the mood is somber Terry
Colby and his Evil Corp executives are crowded in the
conference room FBI Agents are also walking in and out
Gideon looks stressed The air is thick with tension Colby
wants someone’s head on a platter

Angela walks in with a worried look Ali walks in sharing the
same look of dread as everyone else

NEIL DIAMOND
Just an empty room full of empty
space

Elliot nervously walks in eyeing his blue and red manila
envelopes The smile from the night before is now but a
distant memory

NEIL DIAMOND (CONTD)
Like the empty look I see on your
face

INT ALLSAFE OFFICES - CONFERENCE ROOM - LATER

Gideon AllSafe account executives FBI Evil Corp execs
Tyrell and Terry Colby himself surround the expansive table
The red manila envelope sits in front of Elliot He’s sweating
profusely as he swaps the red back into his bag for the blue
He shakes his head in disappointment

Tyrell Wellick notes the folder swap

NEIL DIAMOND
The goods gone from goodbye if you
go away if you go away if you go
away

TERRY COLBY
So what do we got

GIDEON
So if you take a look at the first
page of the agenda--

Everyone flips over one page of their packet Terry looks over
at Elliot Elliot nervously looks back

TERRY COLBY
You’re the one we sent to Virginia
(off Elliot’s nervous nod)
Great work The gals in analysis said
this was a tough one All things
being equal that should have shut us
down for days So you did good

ELLIOT
(uncomfortable)
Okay

Gideon tries to move on

GIDEON
We should start with our account
executive Angela who handled the
initial alert Elliot comes in later

Angela awkwardly waves Terry isn’t impressed

TERRY COLBY
Okay then What do we have Angela
Walk us through this thing

ANGELA
We first noticed the breach at 207
AM Eastern Standard on Friday night-

TERRY COLBY
You mean Saturday

ANGELA
Sorry yes Saturday Technically
Saturday morning

TERRY COLBY
(condescending)
Yeah Angela that’s what we’re here
for The technicals

Noting the condescension Angela hides her anger

ANGELA
Right I’m sorry Anyway he arrived
at the office at 235--

TERRY COLBY
So almost a half hour after the
initial breach Why didn’t anyone
pipe in from their laptops

ANGELA
It’s not protocol--

ELLIOT
It wouldn’t have been secure if
someone terminaled in on this It
would have put the servers at more
risk It was the smarter move to have
someone come in so they can login on
a secure line

ANGELA
(annoyed)
Exactly Then Lloyd was able to--

TERRY COLBY
Actually one sec hon

Terry gestures to Gideon Gideon leans in and Terry whispers
something in his ear From the look on Gideon’s face it’s not
good Angela looks like she’s gonna flip out

After the brief exchange Gideon walks over to Angela and
relays the message Angela angrily collects her papers and
walks out of the conference room

TERRY COLBY (CONTD)
(to Elliot)
Let’s pick it up where you left off

ELLIOT
What happened to Angela She was the
account exec on this--

TERRY COLBY
She’s not gonna work out for us Not
on this level We wanna stick to the
more tech savvy here Now let’s get
right to the heart of this thing
because I can’t sit here and read a
packet for the next twenty minutes
Who did this Were you guys able to
find that out or not

Elliot’s eyes shift back and forth between the embarrassed
Angela who is walking down the hallway the red manila
envelope still in his bag and Terry Colby’s curious look
Elliot instantly gains courage He swaps the blue manila for
the red

ELLIOT
I have all the diagnostics right
here We were able to track down the
IP address including the traceroute
Timestamped and everything I will
also provide an encrypted PDF
version

INT ALLSAFE OFFICES - ELLIOT’S CUBICLE - LATER

Elliot nervously watches from his cubicle as the FBI Colby
and the rest of the execs examine the diagnostics

His eyes wander to the head of the office to glimpse Angela
talking to Gideon Gideon hugs her as she walks out the door
Gideon walks over to Elliot and Lloyd’s cubicle

ELLIOT
Is she gonna be okay

GIDEON
Yeah I told her to take the rest of
the day off I’m gonna move her off
the Evil Corp account I’m gonna
assign Ali to you guys

Elliot eyes Ali across the way Elliot sinks in his seat and
shakes off the disturbing thought His eyes shift back to the
FBI and Colby He looks at you with concern

Elliot sits in front of his rundown stickered up Evil Corp
desktop as a command line program runs password checks with
the keywords Elliot has inputted

ELLIOT (VO)

With those details plus a dictionary
hack it’ll take my program maybe two
minutes to crack his password

While he waits Elliot goes on Facebook and looks up Angela
He scans through the pictures of her and Ali Christmas
vacations Halloween beach parties barbecues etc

ELLIOT (VO)

What I wouldn’t give to be normal To
live in that bubble the reality of

He switches Facebook accounts to Krista his therapist More
happy pictures of families vacations friends

That’s how I justify this To keep
their optimism intact To protect
them

His password program BEEPS He switches screens hurriedly and
discovers the program didn’t come up with a single match

How He’s too old to have a
complicated password It had to have
been a combination of these things

Elliot puts his head down and thinks

ELLIOT (VO)
I’m missing something I’m missing

He closes his eyes He slouches as he rocks back and forth in
his chair His leg twitches rapidly as he mumbles thoughts to
himself Finally he looks up at his screen

ELLIOT (VO)

He quickly goes on Google and does a reverse look-up on
Michael’s phone number

Michael Hansen isn’t his real name

Elliot sits back disappointed
EXT 350 HAWTHORNE AVENUE - NIGHT

Michael walks down his street carrying a screaming baby His
WIFE walks next to him They exchange words before she heads
into the corner convenience store and he walks towards their
apartment building baby in arms Elliot sits on his stoop in
his hoodie smoking a cigarette waiting for him

Elliot’s silhouette takes Michael by surprise

ELLIOT
Youre gonna stop seeing Krista

The sound of her name immediately makes Michael’s eyes grow
wide Elliot stands and faces him The baby cries

ELLIOT (CONTD)
Youre gonna break up with her
tonight and you’re never going to see
her again

MICHAEL
(recognizing him)
Youre the guy that used my phone--

ELLIOT
You cheated on your current wife with
seven different women and I have
digital proof of all of this

Stunned Michael remains still His wife stands in line at the
checkout

ELLIOT (CONTD)
Ashley Madison online escorts fake
Facebook pages I have it all And if
you don’t break up with Krista
tonight your wife will know
everything along with the police

MICHAEL
The police

ELLIOT
Two of the escorts were fifteen

Michael puts his head down with a wince The baby screams
louder

ELLIOT (VO)

That part I made up But he did have
a proclivity for young escorts that
helped the lie

ELLIOT
But I’m not going to do any of that
as long as you break up with Krista
Tonight

Michael looks up at him now out of fear His wife is putting
away her wallet and is about to walk out

MICHAEL
Done I’1l breakup with her--

ELLIOT
You’re also gonna tell her the truth
That you’re married That you cheat
on your wife That you hire
rostitutes That you never had any
intention of being serious with her

MICHAEL
Why That would destroy her

ELLIOT (VO)
Exactly Krista needs to avoid
dickheads like you in the future Her
radar needs fixing

ELLIOT

copying is called MICHAEL HANSEN FILES Once the burn is
complete he pulls out a sharpie and labels it PINK FLOYD -

He grabs a large CD Case from underneath his bed and flips it
open Several other CDs labeled everything from the BEATLES to
ZEPPELIN are in there He files the newly fake-labeled CD and
sends the envelope back under his bed

He jumps back on his computer and deletes the Michael Hansen

question
(off his look)

as he is that he’s there

After a hesitation Angela lets him in

talked to me since the Evil Corp

I don’t want to talk to you because
I feel embarrassed every time I think
about what happened I’1l get over

You didn’t have to take care of me in

help but just don’t do it again
Even if I’m losing Let me lose
Okay

(off his confused look)
Don’t look confused just say okay

Elliot nods She puts her head down disappointed in herself
Though this is awkward for him Elliot slowly hugs her

quickly feels like it could be a kiss But then Elliot
realizes Angela’s eyes are looking behind him He turns
