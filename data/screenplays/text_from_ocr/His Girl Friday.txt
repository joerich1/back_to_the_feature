Divorced me It sort of makes a fellow
lose faith in himself It almost
gives him a feeling he wasnt wanted

HILDY
Holy mackerel Look Walter thats
what divorces are for

BURNS
Nonsense Youve got the old-fashioned
idea that divorces are something
that last forever -- till death us
do part Why a divorce doesnt
mean anything today Its only a few
words mumbled over you by a judge
Weve got something between us nothing
can change

HILDY
I suppose thats true in a way I am
fond of you Walter I often wish
you werent such a stinker

Do you

BURNS
Deny it Im proud of it We beat

what counts

before
jumping off a roof and sits down

BRUCE
Anything the matter

BURNS
Just Sweeney again One of my best
reporters

HILDY
What now

BURNS

His wife had twins and he went out
to celebrate and got as drunk as a

lord They cant even find him
(he sips his coffee)

I tell you drink is the ruin of

this nation

HILDY
(sipping hers)
You said it

BURNS
So -- Sweeney gets twins -- and Earl
Williams gets hanged tomorrow

BRUCE
Just what is the lowdown on Williams

BURNS
Its simple A poor little dope who
lost his job went berserk and shot a
cop who was coming after him to quiet
him down

HILDY
If hes nuts why doesnt the State
just put him away

BURNS
Because it happened to be a colored
policeman

HILDY
(for Bruces benefit)
The colored vote happens to be very
important to the Mayor of this town

BURNS
Especially with an election coming
up in a few days

BRUCE
Are you sure Williams is not all
there

BURNS
All youve got to do is talk to him
But the Mayor would hang his own
grandmother to be re-elected

BRUCE
But couldnt you show the man wasnt
responsible
CLOSEUP - BURNS

BURNS
(theres a sly
expression on his
face)
How

HILDYS VOICE
You could run an interview that would

BRUCE
How long would the interview take

BURNS
Oh -- an hour for the interview

Hildy If it would save a mans life

HILDY
No Bruce dear Dont you see This
is a trick to get your sympathy No
Walter Ive been waiting for
something like this -- but I wasnt
sure when youd spring it If you
want to save Earl Williams life
you can interview him yourself Youre
still a good reporter Bruce and I
will be on that four oclock train --
and thanks just the same

BURNS
Im an editor I know what ought to
be written but I cant write it the
way you could It needs a womans
heart --

HILDY
Why Walter youre getting poetic

BURNS
(to Bruce)
You see what I had to put up with
She never trusted me You argue with
her -- otherwise youre going on a
honeymoon with blood on your hands

Bruce gulps

BURNS
How can you have any happiness after
that All through the years youll
remember that a man went to the
gallows because you were too selfish
to wait two hours I tell you Earl
Williams face will come between you
on the train tonight -- and at the
preachers tomorrow -- and all the
rest of your lives

HILDY
(breaking into applause)
What a performance Bravo Dont let
him fool you Bruce -- its only an
act

BURNS
What do you mean only an act Havent
you got any feeling

HILDY
Well its either an act on your
part or a miracle on Sweeneys

BURNS
What do you mean

HILDY
I happen to know Sweeney was married
only three months ago If hes got
twins this morning I claim it was
done with mirrors

BURNS
(laughs throws up
his hands)
All right Hildy Im licked But
Ill make you and Bruce a business
proposition

HILDY
Were not interested

BURNS
(to Bruce)
Maybe youll be Youre a smart young
man You let Hildy do this story for
me and you can write out a 10000000
insurance policy for me What do you
say

BRUCE

purposes Mr Burns

HILDY
According to the budget we laid out

whole year Listen Bruce I dont
want Walter Burns to use me but Im
perfectly willing to use him How
long will it take to get him examined

BRUCE
I could get a company doctor in twenty
minutes

BURNS

works his way up to twenty-two fifty
A year ago the McClosky Company goes
out of business and Williams loses

a license for it Well the cops let
him alone as much as they can because
hes harmless and theyre kinda sorry
for him But one day he decides to
hold a meeting right in the middle
of a Veterans Parade and the cops
chase him He gets scared and goes
into hiding

at the edge of his cot facing Hildy There is a

roses in a water pitcher by the cot Our first
Williams is that hes a rational well-poised citizen
only under Hildys questioning that he gradually
himself

WILLIAMS
I couldnt plead insanity because
you see Im just as sane as anybody
else

HILDY
(puzzled and worried)
You didnt mean to kill that
policeman

WILLIAMS
Of course not I couldnt kill anybody --
its against everything Ive ever
stood for They know it was an
accident Theyre not hanging me for
that -- theyre hanging me for my
beliefs

HILDY
What are your beliefs Earl

WILLIAMS

Theyre very simple I believe in
the Golden Rule Im not the first
man to die for preaching it But if
they would only listen to it -- we
could have a fine decent world
instead of this mass of hate that
makes man do such cruel things

HILDY
How would you go about applying the
Golden Rule Earl

WILLIAMS
Id do away with the profit system
and have production for use only
Theres enough food and clothing and
shelter for everybody if wed use
some sense

HILDY
(writing)
Production for use only Well
maybe thats the answer

WILLIAMS
Its the only answer Everything has
a use and if we let it be used for
its purpose we could solve all our
problems Food was meant to be eaten
not stored away in restaurants while
poor people starved clothing was
meant to be worn not piled up in
stores while people went naked
Doesnt that make sense

CLOSEUP HILDY

HILDY
