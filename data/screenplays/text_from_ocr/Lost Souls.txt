FADE IN ON
Black screen

SOUND OS -- a CHOKED BACK BREATH GASPING lungs looking for
air the struggle for life and we --

FLASHCUT TO
INT LIMBOWATER - ANOTHER TIME
GASPING for BREATH continues more relentless harder
heavier and into the FRAME we SEE fragments slowed into
special motion dreamlike surreal
Dirty blonde hair lifts and tumbles

Bubbles POP through the murky water

A hand and then its attached arm swims in trouble trying to
climb

And then floats as if disembodied momentary

The SWIMMER drifts then a brief effort twisting signs of
struggle

A leg pushes off the nothingness threatened an impossible
fight

And the claustrophobic GASP a last chocked back BREATH as
other sounds begin to bleed in the CRACKLE of a RADIO a few
VOICES MURMURING and then more clearly --

WOMANS VOICE (0OS)
Jesus please Jesus

The water blurs opaque into a murky veil of illusion and we
DISSOLVE TO

INT FORD FIESTA - MORNING

The cracked windshield of a blue Ford Fiesta The clouded

form of the drowning SWIMMER is replaced by a small plastic

day-glo cross that sways as the Fiesta is lifted up on a tow
truck hoist A PARAMEDIC jogs over to the car as
PARAMEDIC (0S)
Hold it hold on

The Fiesta stops its ascent The passenger side door opens
and the Paramedic reaches in and snares the bopping cross

EXT CITY STREET - MORNING

The Paramedic carries the plastic symbol over to a middle
aged woman whos sitting on a stretcher wearing a foam neck
brace and looking totally relaxed This minor fender-bender
is an ignored sideshow on a quiet commercial street

As the woman reclaims her crucifix a lanky MAN strides by
over-coated against the fall weather We FOLLOW the MAN as
he rounds the corner

EXT ANOTHER CITY STREET - MORNING

And as he walks on he gazes out at a small Catholic Church
ahead

St Ursulas is a modest seminary sitting adjacent to the
Church And just in front behind a chain link fence is

An asphalt playground used by the Churchs pre-school
program A group of CHILDREN play there in happy confusion
watched by TWO FEMALE DAY-CARE WORKERS

EXT PLAYGROUND - MORNING

One of the day-care workers alternately pushes TWO KIDS on
the swings using one hand In her other hand she holds a
cigarette Her clothes are worn her sneakers frayed A
simple gold cross hangs loosely from her neck Shes got
ancient holes in her ear lobes from another earlier time
but no longer any earrings This is MAYA LARKIN The kids
shes pushing are singing Frere Jacques as they soar up and
down on the swings

The second day-care worker more nicely dressed shoots Maya
disapproving glances as she gives her swinging child modest
pushes

A Latino BOY walks up to Maya both his shoes are untied and
his jackets unzipped He points to his feet

MAYA
(with mock severity)
Look at you

She moves away from the swings puts out the cigarette and
stoops down tying his shoes After she finishes Maya
watches him run back into the throng He dashes past the
LANKY MAN standing just ten feet away A powerful figure
CLAUDE LAREAUX is in his sixties A stern heavy expression
glances his face
looking at him a more serious
She tosses her cigarette as we

Maya stands back up slowly
expression on her face now

The cars driver is a fleshy man in his forties named JOHN

TOWNSEND Hes anxious a nail-biter with the worn hands of
a worker Townsends slightly nerve-wracked but trying to
settle it all inside

Maya touches a fore-finger across her upper lip warm she
moves forward covering heat vents with a cupped hand
uncomfortable then finally flipping off the heat altogether
which makes a final WHOOSHING GASP She POWERS OPEN the

hard black leather suitcase

Large windows bordered by huge pillars circumscribe the
never-ending corridors Thick doors line the walls each
with a tiny observation window filled in with octagonal wire
patterns The foursome avoids looking directly at any of
those windows

They pass other rooms doors wide open lined with several
beds each separated by worn curtains

calm and intelligent A mature woman in her late 50s still
attractive at peace with herself As she sips a cup of
peppermint tea she glances outside through a window
opposite her chair at a huge old tree the antithesis of the
sterile prison-like environment inside She finds ways to
remain grounded in this place

As Lareaux and company approach Dr Allen switches her gaze
and --

yellow legal pad He wears green hospital pants and T-shirt

He looks up and smiles at all his visitors a blinding angry
smile

BIRDSON

Sposed to be relaxing

Maya and Townsend avoid looking at Birdson Maya straightens
the cuffs of her sleeves lLareaux puts his Bible and a small

Townsend opens the black leather suitcase Inside rolls of
duct and masking tape two Bibles three rosaries a
scapular bottles of holy water and a gold Chalice sitting
in foam-laden velvet for the Communion Eucharist

Maya quickly and expertly locks in Birdsons chair

Father Jeremy pulls out a roll of duct tape sealing the desk
drawer shut Then he sets up a portable tape recorder on
the table Secures that as well

Birdson restrained Maya pulls large square-cut pieces of
blackout cloth out of the suitcase She grabs a roll of
masking tape TEARING two pieces of it with her teeth right
off the roll A SEARING jarring sound unexpected every
time Moving to the door she immediately tapes a square of
blackout cloth over the observation window As the cloth
drops Dr Allens face disappears

Maya TEARS several more pieces of masking tape continuing to
block out each window

Two hours later Dr Allen is reassuring one of her patients
Shes calm focused helpful

toward her

Dr Allen and the orderly are jogging down the hallway The
sound of SCREAMING can be faintly heard in the distance

Dr Allen starts to run leaving her patient holding her

From the room a CHORUS of TORMENTED VOICES is heard A
hideous CACOPHONY that builds in intensity with each passing
moment punctuated by sharp explosions of wood and glass

It sounds like the room is being torn to pieces Along with
everyone in it

Something heavy hits the door on the other side

Suddenly the door BURSTS open The screaming instantly
stops

Lareauxs at the door pushing past the two orderlies and as
he collapses against a wall Dr Allen sees hes shaking
completely devastated Father Jeremy hurries after him
concerned

FATHER JEREMY
Father are you alright Can you get
up
Laura Allen walks slowly over to the door And bracing
herself she leans forward and stares inside

The room is immaculate Nothings damaged not a stick of
furniture is out of place Townsend and Maya slowly back
out careful not to look at Birdson who sits nonchalantly
still tied to his chair

BIRDSON
Hes right here you know

Birdson turns and stares at Dr Allen with a chilling look of
triumph

BIRDSON (CONTD)
(same languid posture his own
thought process etched in his
brain)
Come on in

Dr Allen freezes Townsend moves past her Maya pulls the
door shut very quickly In her hand shes grabbed Birdsons
legal pad and one of his advanced math books

DEFENSE ATTORNEY (0S)
Mr Silberman you worked with the
defendant George Viznick for two
years

The accused GEORGE VIZNICK Hes in his early 20s with
thick black hair and strong features His neatly-pressed
suit and tie cannot disguise the fact he has the feral eyes
of an unrepentant psychopath

MR SILBERMAN (0S)
Yes

DEFENSE ATTORNEY (0S)
(pacing in front of witness)
And how would you describe him
MR SILBERMAN (0S)
Quiet Real quiet

And on the day of the murders his state
of mind

MR SILBERMAN (0S)
Seemedon edge

DEFENSE ATTORNEY (0S)
On the day of the murders
(dramatic pause)

MR SILBERMAN (0S)
He asked to go home early He said he
was bothered by all the people who kept
telling him what to do

DEFENSE ATTORNEY (0S)
(to the jury)
Tell the jury how many people work in
that office with you and Mr Viznick

MR SILBERMAN (0S)

INT TELEVISION STUDIO - AFTERNOON

The typical particle board and wallpaper set that looks
better on the small screen Two chairs one with Peter and
one with the glossy blonde perfectly styled TV personality
SALLY PRESCOTT

THE FLOOR MANAGER silently finishes the countdown as a make
up man touches up Peter before rushing off the set

SALLY
As a part of todays story on the trial
of mass murderer George Viznick we
welcome Peter Kelson author of the
current best-seller VICIOUS INTENT
Thank you for joining us Peter

PETER
Thanks for having me Sally

SALLY
Peter youre now writing a book about
the Viznick case You seem to be making
a career of studying sensational
murderers I have to ask how does it
make you feel when you sit in courtrooms
day after day face to face with alleged
killers
PETER
Well long-term exposure to things like
this tends to give you a sort of
clinical understanding of the subject
After awhile you begin to make friends
with it so to speak

SALLY
Its as if you are saying the closer you
get to evil the less evil it becomes

PETER

No the less mystifying Good and evil
are only illusions There is no such
thing as evil with a capital E That
suggests some third party bad guy
pulling all the strings

SALLY
(a bit mesmerized)
Youre referring to the defenses
efforts to prove that George Viznick is
tormented by demonic voices

PETER
There werent any voices

SALLY
Not even from some mental illness as
the prosecution asserts

PETER
As if theres another cause for little
voices No Sally Viznicks a
manipulator hes clever he has what I
call malignant narcissism

SALLY
What do you mean by that

PETER
Well we all have a degree of
narcissism Sally but a malignant
narcissist is dangerously self-obsessed

SALLY
Are you saying hes legally sane

PETER
Well George Viznick is in the grayest
of gray areas in the sanity spectrum
Viznick is not psychotic
Hes simply unable to submit to any
higher authority

SALLY
Meaning Viznicks a man who answers to
no one Not even God

PETER

(steps ahead of her)
Right If you believe in God Asa
narcissist Viznick couldnt blame
himself for the alleged murders He
created the voices after the fact In
order to avoid the simple truth that
there is no outside force that guides
George Viznick and that George Viznick
needs to pay

SALLY
(personally interested)
And what about you What about Peter
Kelson Where is your moral compass

Peter is momentarily serious interior then the brief slight
smile

PETER
Well lucky for me Im not on trial
Sally However I like to think Im the
actual needle on the compass Morality
is which way youre facing The needle
always points north

Sally smiles a sucker for that sort of crap

INT CONTROL BOOTH - CONTINUOUS

EXT BEDFORD HOUSE - DUSK

Its a large house Peter pulls up and HONKS As he James
and Claire get out of the car they walk past an old swing
hanging from an enormous tree Childhood remnant

Expecting them a man in his late 30s wearing heavy rimmed
GLASSES moves out of the house This is WILLIAM Peters
brother followed by his wife SUSAN

WILLIAM
About time Im starving

He grabs Peter in a bear hug Peter looks uncomfortable
And as he pulls free he collides inadvertently with a low
hanging tree branch As it starts to bleed Peter sucks on
his lip The swing moves slightly in the bg

CLAIRE
I could use a drink

WILLIAM
Ive got martinis on ice and I grabbed
some good bottles from the cellar

INT DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Everyone except Susan troops into the dining room where an
impressive dinner awaits them They take their places behind
their respective chairs A routine BUZZ of conversation

WILLIAM
Hey Peter I missed your show Howd
it go
CLAIRE
Dont worry we taped it

PETER
I dont think they got my best side

Susan moves in carefully balancing a few ceramic platters
and then she bends over the table squeezing the last plate
onto a huge wooden table already covered with plates of
various food Then she sits down herself Takes a little
breath

SUSAN
This is it If you need anything else
get it yourself

WILLIAM
(mock distress)
Susan I dont see any salt

SUSAN
I love you too

CLAIRE
(to Susan)
You know I made a reservation at
Marcos for Peters birthday dinner but
maybe you should cater it

FATHER JAMES
What time did you make it for

CLAIRE
(to Father James)
Eight That okay

WILLIAM
By the way I want your advice on what
to get him

PETER
(immediately to William kind)
I dont want you spending any money on
me Not right now

FATHER JAMES

(to Peter)
Peter in life you should never deny
the giver the pleasure of the gift

(amused to Claire)
All those years raising him They seem
to have had absolutely no effect Now
William at least he listened to me

WILLIAM
Lets eat already
Father James bows his head and immediately the family
follows A signaled almost unconscious gesture known to
everyone They all look down except Peter Claire gives him
an annoyed glance

FATHER JAMES
Bless us oh Lord for these thy gifts
through they bounty through Christ our
Lord And a special blessing for Peter
and Williams mother Andrea and their
father Jack in whose memory we gather
here every year May their souls and
the souls of the faithfully departed
rest in peace Amen

A stark silence as Peter and William remember Claire looks
at Susan Then

PETER
Hey Will remember that dream I used to
have over and over again when I was
little about the bear and the mountain
You know right after

William nods yes

PETER (CONTD)
well you know I really think the
trials getting to me because Ive been
having this weird dream every night
Only this time of course its much
different

Everyones looking at Peter

CLAIRE
You never said anything to me

PETER
Its probably trivial

JAMES
Recurring dreams are never
insignificant

PETER
Okay Ill tell you Im reading a book
- I cant remember what the book is when
I wake up - but I realize halfway
through its something Ive written Or
will write Anyway I get to the end of
the book and Im feeling very satisfied
and I close the cover to read the title
and it only says x-e-s Three
letters For some reason that makes me
feel great and I wake up
CLAIRE
(looking around at the silenced
table holding back a smirk a
moment then)
Peter x-e-s is sex spelled
backwards

More silence then James bursts out LAUGHING Then Susan
cant gold it back and then William

PETER
(looks around big smile
turning into LAUGHTER)
What can I say Im not a master of the
obvious

And that sends everyone into an uncontrollable fit of
LAUGHTER and as theyre all in various states of choked back
hysterics suddenly Williams LAUGHING becomes seriously
uncontrolled and then

Williams head involuntarily jerks backward his eyes begin
to roll up

Susan is first to notice while LAUGHTER continues in the
bg and she leaps to catch him

As William starts to tip over backward in his chair Peter
then realizes and together Susan and Peter ease William onto
the floor and turn him on his side

James grabs a pillow from an armchair in the room shoving it
under Williams head and

As Williams epileptic attack winds down slightly Susan
looks up at James

SUSAN
Its been a long time since his last
seizure I guess weve got to adjust
his medication again

INT SEMINARY HALLWAY - NIGHT

The shadowy figures of Maya and John Townsend can be seen
almost in silhouette

TOWNSEND
And what are you thinking we should do
now

MAYA

Ive filed a report with Father Frank

TOWNSEND
A lot of good thatll do
MAYA
We need all the help we can get

TOWNSEND
Ive dealt with these people before
Maya Theyre not going to help us

MAYA

TOWNSEND
(on edge)
Alright Maya Well do it your way

INT SEMINARY CHAPEL - NIGHT
A troubled John Townsend prays to God for answers
INT SEMINARY OFFICE - EARLY MORNING

FATHER FRANK a sweet-faced priest in his 40s is conferring
with two church officials We TRACK him as he exits the
office and cross through to

INT ALTAR - CONTINUOUS

A JANITOR polishes the marble of the ornate altar Father
Frank enters and pauses a moment to watch the man at work

FATHER FRANK
Dont forget to polish the brass
afterwards

EXT SEMINARY GARDEN - CONTINUOUS

The seminary has a small planted meditative garden shoe
horned in behind the rectory buildings

Maya sits on a simple wooden bench her tiny cross glinting
off sunlight Her eyes are closed and her head is tilted up
toward the sun

Maya snaps out of her reverie as Father Frank approaches

FATHER FRANK
(kind but resolved)
Maya the Diocese has rejected your
report And I must say I agree with
them

A JET ROARS overhead DEAFENING momentary noise Father
Frank looks up a moment then

FATHER FRANK (CONTD)
(comforting tone)
I dont mean to belittle you but weve
been through this before Satan is not
what you think he is Satan is not some
creature

MAYA
You werent there Give me time to get
some proof

FATHER FRANK
Please Maya Im trying to get us into
the next century and you insist on this
medieval nonsense

MAYA
If you really believe in God why is it
so inconceivable that his enemy is just
as real

FATHER FRANK
Maya for the last time I will not
tolerate these obsessions

Anxious Maya rubs her cross between a thumb and forefinger
distractedly

INT SEMINARY STAIRWELL - EARLY MORNING
Maya crosses through the dim hallway and heads up the stairs

INT SEMINARY BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

A bright clean bathroom with new fixtures and fluorescent
lights Maya comes in trying to contain her frustration
Turns the water on She watches the water a moment Then
puts her hands in Cool on her wrists Splashes her face

MAYA
(despairing)
Stupid man I cant do this

At that moment she hears something Its faint but
unmistakable - the sound of SCRAPING METAL ON METAL Then it

stops

MAYA (CONTD)
Hello

No response

ANGLE FROM ABOVE

Maya faces all six stalls She walks to the first one
pushes open the door Its empty She repeats this at the
second stall the thirds the fourth the fifth All are

vacant Now the last one She pauses just a second

The lights HUM She pushes it open Its empty Disturbed
she turns back to the sink and as she looks down the water
flows instantly backwards disappearing up into the faucet

e turns back again watching the room change from pristine
o rotting decay The stalls behind her have changed The
oors are closed again Theyre battered chipped scarred
usty water flows from underneath She whirls around On

e stall directly behind her the letters X E and S
ave been scratched into the metal in loose flowing script
t the same time the lights go dim The HUM is uneven more
enacing Alarmed Maya closes her eyes then opens them

e vision remains Her breathing gets lighter faster
Fingers appear on the top of the stall door behind her The
door is pulled open A man in inside wearing hospital
clothes Its Henry Birdson His eyes bore into hers Hes
got a knife in his right hand Petrified she stares back

HB Pret wWadcn

MAYA (CONTD)
Youre not real

He leers and nods Yes I am He steps toward her Every
instinct in her body screams at her to run But she stays
put And we HEAR A CHOKED BACK BREATH and Birdson slowly
extends his knife just inches from her face

Closer to her face Then closer still Until the tip of the
blade is slowly creeping toward Mayas eye

ECU

of the tip of the blade literally millimeters from her
pupil Closing painfully slow Maya braces herself

ECU
of the tip of the knife now only a hair away
ANGLE ON
Birdson He smiles And THRUSTS She suddenly reaches up
and grabs for the blade The lights flare horrifyingly

bright for a split second We hear a surreal distortion of
Mayas voice crying out

And Birdson vanishes Mayas looking at a pristine
bathroom its unmarked stall doors pulled tight Victorious
but drained she slumps forward

INT LAREAUXS ROOM - MORNING

Inside Father Lareauxs Spartan room at the seminary Lareaux
lies in bed his face turned towards the wall Hes
MUMBLING Maya has pulled herself together and sits by the
bed with Father Jeremy and an irritated Father Frank

In the bg John Townsend is urgently riffling the books and
papers on Lareauxs desk Most of which we SEE are about
demonic possession
Unknown to anyone Townsend slides two of the books under his
coat

FATHER FRANK
(to Maya)
Leave him alone

Maya doesnt want to hear that She leans closer The full
wound of her childhood pressed back into her eyes

MAYA
(compassionately)
Father its me Maya Tu mentends

Lareaux rolls over and looks at her The change in his
appearance is shocking His eyes are red-rimmed and his
expression is unfocused

LAREAUX
(with a nursery rhyme cadence)
the ark sank the sun set the ark
sank again

MAYA
Father Im right here

LAREAUX
(like a child)
the ark sank the sun set the ark
sank again

his eyes are wild Father Frank turns to Maya

FATHER JAMES
Hes not going to respond

Maya slowly backs away

FATHER FRANK
The doctors concerned he may never come
out of this dementia

MAYA
He will He has great faith

FATHER FRANK
But bad judgement And now you see how
dangerous the consequences can be

Maya moves over to a silent John Townsend

MAYA
John Ive got to head back to the
city
(to Father Jeremy)
Would you page me if theres any change
whatsoever
(Maya hurriedly writes her
pager number down for Jeremy)
Anything okay

FATHER JEREMY
(under his breath)

Maya smiles sweetly at Father Jeremy
INT SEMINARY HALLWAY - MORNING
Maya and Townsend confer down the hall from Lareauxs room

TOWNSEND
(agitated)
Sure of what Who cares if this guy is
devoid of faith or sleeps over a
pentacle Results are what Lareaux
would want

Maya stares intently at Townsend Father Jeremy approaches
from down the hall aware of the tension between them

TOWNSEND (CONTD)
You dont want to face it

MAYA
Look John Im facing it

TOWNSEND

Townsend walks away

FATHER FRANK
Is he going to be okay

MAYA

Claire with known literary celebrities At the large granite

Y yo tendre mi propria secretaria

SNAPPING off the lights in her office And in the bg the
fragmentary sounds of a party going on somewhere down the
hall in another office A moment then her outer office
door slams

Peter goes back to work at his desk Finishing up Another
moment and he hears Mrs Qs door PRESS BACK OPEN

PETER
(not looking up)
Whatd you forget

No response Peter looks up He waits then continues to
put his things away in preparation for leaving After a
moment he glances up to see MAYA standing in the doorway
Shes taken pains to look attractive Her best clothes She
looks great A simple beauty
PETER (CONTD)
(startled)
May I help you

MAYA
Peter Kelson

PETER
(observes everything about her)
Yes and you are

MAYA
(slightly flirtatious
gregarious)
I saw you on television yesterday You
were brilliant

PETER
Thank you Do you work in the building
You coming from the party

Maya takes the chair opposite Peters desk He stands
waiting A little put off by her forwardness

MAYA
You said that malignant narcissism was
not evil

PETER

Not pure evil Thats correct

MAYA
And also that

PETER
(uncomfortable)
Listen Im sorry but Im running late

MAYA
That there is no such thing as evil with
a capital E

PETER
Not the most popular opinion but yes

MAYA
What if I told you I was a malignant
narcissist

Intrigued Peter stops what hes doing and sits down
PETER
A narcissist doesnt admit it Its the

extreme of self-denial

MAYA
(ignoring Peters comment)
And I also believe in God and the Devil
In fact I know they exist

PETER
Well by saying that youre
acknowledging the existence of a higher
power Which to a narcissist is
impossible

MAYA
I murdered my parents Mr Kelson And
while they deserved it I still went to
confession the following Sunday

Peter leans back in his chair Studies her carefully
Doesnt really know what to say

PETER
Ooooooh-kayyyyyy

MAYA
In the end the jury saw it my way

PETER
Well then it all seems to be working
out for you Listen Ms

MAYA
Do you remember Henry Birdson The math
professor who won the Salwen Medal then
went home and killed his family

PETER
(irritated)
Whats that got to do with you

MAYA
Last week the Catholic Church certified
him as genuinely possessed You realize
how rarely they make that ruling

PETER
I do

MAYA
An exorcism was just held for Birdson
It failed Disastrously Which means
theres still a demonic spirit present
in his body
(then)

I was wondering perhaps youd like to
go meet Henry Hes pretty amazing

PETER
Ill bet

MAYA
On television you seemed so sure of
yourself If youre really that
confident youd be willing to let
someone prove you wrong

PETER
The world would be so much simpler if it
were all just about good and evil
Unfortunately I find it much more
slippery and elusive place

MAYA
(intrigued by Peters mind)
Well I think its very simple Heres
a tape of Birdsons exorcism
(drops tape on Peters desk)
Ill be at the Public Library Tomorrow
at 2 if you want to meet him

Maya rises and heads for the door Seductive A certain
power in her clarity

MAYA (CONTD)
I believe that murder and murderers are
the most interesting proving ground for
these kinds of questions Dont you

Peter knows he agrees but before he can respond shes gone

His body curled backwards at a horribly severe angle and his
arms are wrapped tightly around his torso Hes a gruesome
sight An IV TUBE is taped to his wrist and an EEG is
attached to his head The brain wave monitor indicates no
activity

PETER
Jesus

A beaming Dr Allen walks in Shes a little starstruck
DR ALLEN

Mr Kelson what a pleasure to meet you
I have to say your instincts about the

criminally insane are impeccable I am
a fan

PETER
Quite a compliment coming from you
doctor

Dr Allen realizes Mayas beside him

DR ALLEN
(to Peter)
When your secretary called she made no
mention of her coming too

PETER
(glancing at Maya)
My secretary

DR ALLEN
Youre aware that this woman was party
to the so-called exorcism

PETER
No I wasnt actually

DR ALLEN
You should know I never felt Mr Birdson
needed anything but professional
psychiatric care And then minutes
after they left he suffered a stroke
Hes comatose No brain wave activity
at all

Dr Allen adjusts Birdsons IV unit re-taping an already
swollen hand

PETER
So you dont believe his condition is
the result of anything supernatural

DR ALLEN
Of course not They put him through
severe mental stress Causing this
aneurysm

MAYA
Dr Allen could you please tell Mr
Kelson what you heard as you tried to
enter Mr Birdsons room

DR ALLEN
(ignoring Maya)
I certainly hope youre not lending any
credence to this

MAYA
(aggressive)
What did you hear

Peter looks at Dr Allen questioningly
DR ALLEN
The patient was in great distress

Naturally he wasyelling

MAYA
And was he in distress when you opened
the door Or was he sitting here
relaxed at this table

DR ALLEN
(calmly)
There is a medical explanation for
everything that happened

MAYA
(boring in)
You heard voices you know you did

Theres a silence in the room Dr Allen stares at Maya

ORDERLY
It sounded like a hundred people to me

Maya Peter and Dr Allen turn and look at the orderly
Peters shocked by the orderlys admission Glances back at
Dr Allen

DR ALLEN
Ive already said Mr Birdson was
agitated Victor why dont you go and
check on the patient in room 5

Her tone is frighteningly friendly The orderly leaves
Peter looks at Maya then Dr Allen

PETER
(curious)
Just describe it to me the scene when
you came back

As Peter speaks Maya has an uncomfortable feeling She
turns and sees Birdson STARING AT HER Eyes wide open
Above him the monitors still showing no brain wave
activity He grins at her

MAYA
Oh my God

Peter and Dr Allen turn quickly - as Birdson snaps his eyes
back shut

MAYA (CONTD)
He just woke up Hes awake

What they see is a motionless man in exactly the same
position as before The monitors still showing nothing but
steady horizontal waves

Dr Allen shakes her head at Mayas outburst Dismissive of
her altogether and then to Peter

DR ALLEN
Im surprised at you Mr Kelson And
now Im afraid Im going to have to ask
the two of you to leave

but hes still distracted Claire however is her outgoing
self William in a rented tux and Susan in a modest gown
hang on the edge of the golden crowd A JADED YOUNG MAN is
leading the conversation

YOUNG MAN

John Townsend is

revealed beads of sweat glistening on his brow and a gun in

his hand

TOWNSEND
(whispering)
God will forgive me the time of
transformation is so near

He points it at Peters face Peter is in

shock Everything

around him seems to blur except the gun floating a few feet
away But Townsend hesitates obviously conflicted

And suddenly the woman to Peters left SCREAMS The
waiters tray goes flying With astonishing speed William
flings himself onto Townsend They both go down A SHOT
RINGS OUT Pandemonium Screams and shouting Peter sees
that William has Townsend in a brutal headlock Townsend
looks panicked helpless Peter is pulled back as the two
men disappear beneath a swarm of other bodies

Peters overt belligerence scares the children
PETER

He motions towards the door Maya turns to the class

MAYA

And as shes pulled into the hall we SEE
INT SCHOOL HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Maya still holding the brightly colored vocabulary pictures
stands with Peter in the hallway Opposite her in the hall
is a window and to the left an old radiator with chipped
enamel paint Next to the wall is a plain wooden bench
Maya stands with her back to her classroom door She
continually checks on her kids through a window in the door

PETER
(really pissed off
Last night a guy named John Townsend
tried to shoot me and now I find out you
knew him What the fuck is going on

MAYA
Please the children

Peter moves in close crowding her against the wall

PETER
(lowering his voice)
Why did he try to kill me

MAYA
(looking at classroom)
Townsend believed just as God became
man in Christ
(Maya turns back to Peter)
So Satan will assume human form I
believe it too

Peter grabs the pictures out of her hand and pitches them
into the hall

PETER
And the point is
MAYA
At the exorcism Birdson boasted that
Satan is about to take over the body of
a man
(long pause)
You are that man Peter

PETER
What

MAYA
Its true Birdson knew your name he
was writing it in numerical code It

wasnt easy but I figured it out It
spelled your name

PETER
(sarcastic)
Why didnt Birdson just say so

MAYA
If youre possessed you cant reveal
anything Satan wants hidden Unless you
trick him

PETER
(now completely unimpressed)
Trick him

MAYA
The good outwitting the bad Its like
Birdson had a split personality

PETER
(hes had it laughs)
You should think about getting
professional help

MAYA
Youre already contaminated Its why
you couldnt hear the tape Theres
probably a pentacle near your bed To
sanctify you

PETER
Im not going to be drawn into this

MAYA
I know this sounds crazy I understand
Check your parents blood types Are
you sure your parents are your birth
parents

PETER
My parents are dead Dont even think
of bringing them into this
The school bell rings Within seconds the hallway is
flooded with kids and teachers

A smiling Father Frank stops out of a classroom As he sees
Maya and Peter down the hall his face darkens He starts
towards them

MAYA
(moving to Peter whisper)
Youre about to become the anti-Christ
who is born unholy and becomes the door
to eternal suffering in this world

PETER
(pissed off at himself now)
If you or any of your lunatic friends
ever come near me again

Peter notices Father Frank moving up on Maya and takes off
EXT STREET - OUTSIDE SEMINARY - DAY

An angry Peter walks to his Range Rover The wind is up and
it has started to rain Peters under-dressed hunching his
shoulders against the elements Hes parked a distance from
the Seminary As he begins a slow jog to his car the rain
begins to come down a bit harder Suddenly Peter slips on
the wet pavement and falls scraping his hand A moment
while he gets his bearings and then he picks himself up the
rain now shooting down the side of his face

INT MAYAS ROOM IN THE SEMINARY - CONTINUOUS

An anxious Maya sits at her desk Suddenly theres a hard
knock on the door and Father Frank enters Maya looks up
unprepared

FATHER FRANK

Maya looks up at him but Father Franks out the door
INT FATHER LAREAUXS ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Father Lareaux sleeps quietly quasi fetal Maya moves to
the room soundlessly A renewed sadness stabs her at the
sight of Lareaux She studies him a moment then cups his
face in her hands Slight disturbance in Lareauxs body
like a childs startle reaction Maya lets go and leaves as
quietly as she came

INT ITALIAN RESTAURANT - DAY

agitated His clothes are still wet and pretty wrinkled
Claire looks at him with tenderness

PETER

Peter looks at her skeptically a little pissed off

PETER
Youre glad somebody tried to kill me

CLAIRE
(nervous about confronting him)
No of course not but I think now that
this has happened a lot of things can
start to come out

PETER
(still pissed)
Yeah like

CLAIRE
(coming on a little stronger)
Like you need to admit that losing your
parents when you were twelve was
traumatic

PETER
(unafraid)
Its with me all the time Claire I
just dont like to talk about it

CLAIRE
Well it shattered your faith in
everything

PETER
(trying to lighten it)
Im just temporarily off my game

CLAIRE
(boring in)
You need to believe in something besides
yourself

PETER
I believe in you

A moment where Claire hesitates then she decides to let
herself be flattered

CLAIRE
(leaning in close to Peter)
I love you You look a mess
Why dont you go home and clean up
before you go back to work

Claire kisses Peter brief but deep as she gulps in a short
gust of air

Outside the rain has stopped as Claire gets up taking off
for work without him

EXT STREET - OUTSIDE SEMINARY - DAY

Maya is sitting on an iron bench outside the playground A
shoulder bag with some of her belongings lays beside her
She stands picks up her sack and walks across the street to
a small diner

INT DINER - DAY

Its warm crowded and NOISY WAITRESSES banter with
longtime customers about the ups and downs of everyday life
Maya enters in a state of complete distress She sits at the
counter next to a MOTHER and her LITTLE GIRL Their drinks
and sandwiches are spread out everywhere The little girl
cusp her hand around a tall glass of milk She wears black
patent shoes a red jacket hood attached Maya bows her
head and covers her eyes Shes losing it

MAYA
(whisper)
I cant do this anymore

The little girl about 4 years old tugs on Mayas sleeve

LITTLE GIRL
You have to put your napkin in your lap

MOTHER
(embarrassed)
Gina

Maya looks at the solemn little girl

MAYA
(to her mother)
Its okay
(she puts her napkin in her
lap)

MOTHER
Im sorry shes very into rules

LITTLE GIRL
Doesnt your daughter put her napkin in
her lap

MAYA
(softly)
I dont have a daughter Im not
married

LITTLE GIRL
Arent you lonely

MOTHER
Okay Gina thats enough

Maya sees the little girl wants an answer Moved she bends
close and whispers in her ear

MAYA
I have someone who takes care of me

She pulls back The little girl looks up at Maya
reprovingly

LITTLE GIRL
(cruelly)
But hes dead Jesus is dead

And then she smiles at Maya a wicked smile Maya looks at
the little girl and then at her mother The mothers eyes
are sparkling with malice The room begins to warp and
distort And we hear a choked back breath

Horrified Maya quickly turns in her chair and faces away
from the vision praying silently with eyes closed After a
moment she opens her eyes The room looks normal again In
the reflection of the mirror across the counter she sees that
the two seats next to her are empty the utensils untouched
Sighing with relief she turns back But the little girl and
her mother are still there The mothers face suddenly looks
elongated her eyes move too close together and her nose
disappears A frightening distortion but momentary And
the little girls smile widens with spite

LITTLE GIRL (CONTD)
Youre so weak

With a loud frightened cry Maya sweeps her arms out
knocking all the nearby glasses utensils and dishes to the
floor with a tremendous crash Milk bleeds over the counter
All eyes turn to her Distraught Maya sees the little girl
and the mother are gone She grabs her bag and runs out the
diner

INT PETERS APARTMENT - DAY

Its quiet shadowy The aquarium has begun a slow leak and
a small puddle of water has pooled beneath it Peter enters
He notices the water on the floor He goes into the bedroom

INT PETERS BEDROOM - DAY

The ledge of the building across the way can be seen from
Peters window A WOMAN is moving near the ledge setting
out a grouping of potted geraniums From downstairs a shaft
of light is visible

Peter changes his clothes Then he feels the scrape on his
hand Looks at it As he moves to the bathroom Washes his
hand and as he does so he checks his reflection in the
mirror Stares at himself a moment then sticks out his
tongue Checks it And then dries his hand moving back to
the bedroom carrying his towel with him Peter glances at
his bed a moment Half-amused he leans over and checks
behind the picture hanging above the headboard

Nothing

Then he bends down checking under the bed Again nothing

Then he moves to a bedroom closet pulling down a black and
gray speckled file box

Inside a series of newspaper clippings graphic photos
Yellowed with age on of which falls on the bed titled
Unsolved Brutal Murders Peter riffles past the clippings
to the coroners report

He speed reads it until he gets to his parents blood types
Andrea Kelson - A negative Jack Kelson - O positive
Peter stares at the information Confused by what its
supposed to mean Then he pulls on a turtleneck sweater
ready to go back out

PETER
This is ridiculous

Peter exits the bedroom and steps back towards the living
room carrying the towel

INT PETERS LIVING ROOM

Peter passes through to his front door throwing his towel on

casually studying Peters personal desk photos

MICHAEL
Umm Melvin Szabo this is Peter Kelson

The stranger looks up Hes young and cocky with thick
glasses Hes holding a picture of Peter with his parents

PETER
(to Melvin)
Id appreciate it if youd put that
back

MELVIN
You are the younger of two

He puts down that photo and picks up one of Claire as Peter
walks over to his chair and a position of more control

MELVIN (CONTD)
(indicating Claire)
Youre afraid of committing to this
girl

Peter grabs one of his pens and begins rolling it between his
fingers

MELVIN (CONTD)
But she worships you Your mothers
dead but your fathers alive

PETER
Nothing you couldnt find out from
reading the papers And youre already
wrong on one count

MELVIN
Viznick will get off and Michaels got a
crush on you

Michael looks alarmed Peter notices his pen is leaking all
over his hand

PETER
You know what You can go
MELVIN
Suit yourself But does this mean
anything to you

Melvin picks up a pen and writes X-E-S in florid script on
a pad He holds it out for Peters inspection Peter is
rattled

MELVIN (CONTD)
You do know dont you That these are
also numbers Greek numbers 600 60
and 6 - or 666 The sign of the Devil

PETER
Get out of here

MELVIN
(pleasantly)
Goodbye

He sticks out his hand and grabs Peters His expression
changes from one of amused disdain to fascinated curiosity

MELVIN (CONTD)
Wait a minute

His arrogance melts away Melvins face tightens A shudder
of fear passes through him

MELVIN (CONTD)
(strangled gasp)
God will forgive methe time of
transformation is so near

But the voice is that of John Townsend

PETER
(really shaken)
Get the fuck out of here

INT NYC STREET - DAY
HIGH ANGLE ON

Peter stands in the middle of the sidewalk as the wind
violently whips at his jacket He gazes upward to the mute
gray sky Finally he lowers his eyes He sees something
that angers him

EXT CATHOLIC CHURCH - DAY

A sprawling Catholic church stands before him Peter regards
it with wrath He pushes open the door and tries to enter
but a group of LITHUANIAN parishioners pushes past him
blocking his way A priest calls a farewell
LITHUANIAN PRIEST (0S)
(in Lithuanian)
See you all next week

The entry finally clear Peter goes inside
INT CATHOLIC CHURCH - CONTINUOUS

Its dark forbidding The priest exits around a corner
Peter looks at the vast and spacious altar Above it is an
enormous wooden crucifix Peter moves down the aisle toward
the altar

ECU

The sorrowful face of the Christ figure looks down on Peter
with pity The body hangs gaunt wracked with pain The
wrists pierced by nails the feet cruelly hammered together

Peter stops at the first pew He looks up at the crucifix
Defiant

PETER
Go ahead do something Show me

He waits For a split-second theres a pristine silence
Then the sound of the wind rises in the church With that
the right wrist SHATTERS with a noise like a rifle shot
Freed from one of its supports the heavy wooden Christ SLAMS
FORWARD at an awkward angle The other wrist SNAPS IN TWO

For a second the Christ figure trembles Then with a
sickening sound the entire wooden body falls forward swings
sideways and PLUMMETS down Peter doesnt want to look The
figure is now hanging upside down held only by the brace at
its feet Above it each hand remains pinned to the cross
Its an EXACT COPY of Viznicks tattoo

INT BIRDSONS ROOM - DAY

Birdsons eyes open

shoulder bag at her feet

EXT PLAYGROUND - DAY

Standing beside Maya is an agitated DAY-CARE WORKER Their
conversation is FAINTLY AUDIBLE Across the yard a SECOND
DAY-CARE WORKER is shepherding the last of the kids back
inside the center The children are carefree and
rambunctious unaware of the adult drama taking place around
them

DAY-CARE WORKER
Go on get them inside
(sympathetically to Maya)
Look you dont have a job here anymore
They want you to leave

CLOSE ON

Mayas face Shes devastated In the bg a YOUNG GIRL
does a triple on the roll bar Three girls and one boy
compete for distance on the monkey bars

The Latino Boy and one of his friends LAUGH and break free
from the line heading back to the school They circle back
toward Maya and swoop by her waving exuberantly then return
to the line and go into the school The day-care worker
follows them as

Peter walks through the gate He walks fast toward Maya who
sees him coming from a distance Maya continues rocking
ever so gently on her swing Peter puts out his hands and
stops it Stares at her scared

PETER
(lost)
I dont understand whats going on

MAYA

Theres no reason why you should

(tells him as gently as

possible)
This has been planned from your birth
You fit all the criteria that we know
of Never baptized born of incest
devoid of faith

PETER
But I was baptized And I certainly

wasnt born of incest

MAYA
You were not baptized At least I dont
believe it was Christian Your baptism
was performed by your uncle James
McKenzie

PETER
Yes I know

MAYA
The only baptism he ever performed in
seven years as pastor at Bedford

PETER
So what

MAYA
Seven years One baptism Hes your
mothers only brother

PETER
Yes

Maya stares at Peter

MAYA
Do you know your parents blood types

PETER
I looked at the coroners report My
fathers O positive and my motherA
negative

MAYA
(taking this in a gasp of air)
Peter your blood-type is AB negative
Theres no way your birth father can be
O positive You father is not who you
think he is

PETER
(really shaken)
Sothen the coroners report is
probably wrong I meanthis is
ridiculous Theres been a mistake I
dont believe any of this

MAYA
Then why are you here

That silences Peter He sits heavily in the swing next to
her

MAYA (CONTD)
Peter I believe your baptism was
perverted Look at your certificate
Your mother was the only witness to it
Your blood-type doesnt match who you
thought your father was PeterIm
sorry

PETER
(desperate)
And if what youre saying is true what
would happen to me

MAYA

I dont know

(beat)
I do know that people who are possessed
have to accept evil in some way I
dont know if it works the same way in
this instance I dont even know when
its going to happen

glances away runs a hand through his hair and

Peter is immediately drawn to the table where he sees new
copies of his books Chilled Peter turns to Maya

PETER
Hes got all my books

Maya looks over at Peter

MAYA
We needed to know all we could

PETER
Im going to look around

INT HALLWAY - NIGHT

Peter crosses the hallway into the dining room

INT DINING ROOM

The rooms dominated by a long wooden dining table covered

with a chintz tablecloth The window shutters are open and
moonlight streams in
Peter tries the light switch It doesnt work He walks
around the room - and is spooked by a glimpse of movement

Its his own reflection in a mirror He sees a closet door
and opens it Inside its totally dark He pulls a hanging
cord A light goes on revealing a small pantry filled with
canned goods foodstuff

Peter goes to the other side of the pantry and opens another
door

INT LIBRARY - NIGHT
Maya continues to comb through the bookshelves
INT KITCHEN

Peter steps into a dingy kitchen A dirty coffee cup anda
plate sit on the counter near the sink At the other end of
the kitchen past the refrigerator is a door leading
outside Peter approaches the door glances through the
window He then turns and walks through a doorway

INT BACK HALLWAY - NIGHT

Peter stands at the base of the rear staircase As he starts
to ascend the stairs

PETER
(calling out)
Ill be upstairs

INT LIBRARY

Maya is flipping through Peters books Suddenly she hears
the tread of footsteps overhead It startles her

MAYA
(reassuring herself)
Peter

She puts down the book and turns around Surveying the room
she sees an entrance to the hallway that services the master
bedroom

INT HALLWAY

Maya walks through the hall towards the open door of the
master bedroom She goes in

INT MASTER BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

An antique oak bed dominates the room with two suitcases
lying on top The place is a mess - clothes strewn
everywhere Theres a roll-top desk in the corner with some
books and papers on it One of Townsends jackets is draped
on the desk chair
On the opposite wall is a door thats open just a crack The
interior of a bathroom is visible on the other side The
door has a smoky opaque window built into its top half

Maya starts sifting through the papers on the desk She can
hear Peters footsteps moving slowly above her And the
sound of doors opening

She opens the desk drawers The first one is stuffed with
bills The second has checkbooks bank statements The
third is stuck shut

Maya kneels down to get better leverage From this
perspective we can see the open door to the dark hallway
behind herShe pulls and pulls again As the drawer pops
open a shadow falls across her She WHIRLS
REVERSE
Its Peter
PETER
Not much upstairs A couple of empty

bedrooms and a bathroom Anything here

Maya looks at the contents of the drawer Its full of
Christian literature

MAYA
Nothing yet

PETER

Ill go outside and take a look in the

garage
Maya nods Peter exits the room She hears his footsteps
fade away and a door slam As she stands up she knocks
Townsends jacket off the chair A book falls out of a
pocket Its on of the books Townsend took from Lareauxs
room Maya opens it
ECU
Tiny cryptic notations are scrawled in the margins
EXT TOWNSENDS HOUSE
Peter walks down the side steps and over to the large garage
INT MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
An intrigued Maya turns another page

INT GARAGE - NIGHT

Peter enters Sees a switch Flips it on and a fluorescent
light BUZZES ON He peruses old boxes two dusty black
filing cabinets Ruston curtain rods a box of broken
appliances and an old stove covered with an orange tarp

INT MASTER BEDROOM

As Maya reads she hears a light SCRAPING noise She
glances up Silence She waits Nervous Maya then goes
back to her book Excited she spots something thats
important She hears another light SOUND

MAYA

INT HALLWAY

Maya listens She hears a few footsteps in the adjacent
bathroom

MAYA
(to herself)
Jesus Peter you scared me

INT HALLWAY

Book in hand Maya walks over to the bathroom door and flings
it open

MAYA
(rushes in)
Look at this

She steps into the bathroom and freezes
INT BATHROOM - NIGHT

Henry Birdson is standing in the corner same green
regulation drawstring pants and matching T-shirt He has a
fish-gutting knife in his hand With an evil smile he
calmly steps forward imitating the gesture Maya saw in the
restroom at the seminary He raises his knife holding it
out in front of her Maya stands still She wants to run
more than anything in life but she doesnt Instead she
reaches out one hand and touches the knife ever so gently
with the tips of her fingers Fro a second neither one
moves Mayas face registers great fear Birdson slides the
knife back Maya sees blood on her hands coming from a cut
on her fingers She trembles but doesnt run Maya uses
the humility and calm of an experienced exorcist

MAYA
(a whisper)
Henry Christ loves you

Birdson looks at her with the impassive malignant gaze of a
snake
MAYA (CONTD)
Christ can save you Henry

Birdson shakes his head as Mayas dangling cross picks off
particles of pure light

MAYA (CONTD)
Just say his name say his name and
youll be free

Birdson agitated moves closer

MAYA (CONTD)
(soothing)
Say his name

He slowly traverses the air in front of her face with his
knife Maya steps back trapped her eyes never leaving
Birdsons

MAYA (CONTD)
(with love)
Christ loves you

For a SPLIT SECOND the real Henry Birdson appears then he
smiles grotesquely and in a new VOICE

BIRDSON
(lascivious)
Yes but does he swallow

VERY FAST

Maya dives out the door With a SNARL Birdson recovers and
lunges for her

INT MASTER BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Maya throws herself back into the bedroom SLAMMING the door
shut behind her as Birdsons body smashes into it Maya sees
Birdsons shadowy form trying to break the glass with an
animal-like fury Scrambling against his mounting pressure
Maya tries but fails to get the lock to close The door
SHUDDERS as Birdson pummels it with his body Birdson
CRACKS the glass A spiderweb of shards rips through the
window

BIRDSON
(different VOICES)
Fucking bitch Open the door

Maya drops Lareauxs book shouldering her weight against the
door He hits it so hard it opens Maya shoves it back
and straining manages to lock it At the same moment she
realizes theres no more pressure on the other side She
stops pushing
POV

Over her shoulder we see the door behind her slightly open
She turns and realizes this takes two steps toward that door
and then freezes Mayas in the center of the room
equidistant from all the doors
She looks back at the door to the bathroom No shadows block
the light at its base Ever so slowly keeping her eyes on
the bathroom door she reaches over unlocks and then pulls
open the door to the hall It swings open silently She
strains listening as hard as she can But the only sound
she can hear is her own shallow breathing She says a silent
prayer Then steps gingerly toward the door to the hallway
As she takes a second step

Birdson BURSTS through the bathroom door behind her He
leaps and slashes at her cutting her arm as she bolts
through the door to the hallway

INT HALLWAY - NIGHT

flying into the

INT LIBRARY

Where - WHAM - she collides full tilt with a body

MAYA
AHHHH

Its Peter They hit the ground groggy

MAYA (CONTD)
Get up

PETER
Whats theOH SHIT

Birdson races in knife held high Peter grabs the small
reading table and uses it as a shield as they scramble to
their feet Whipping the knife back and forth at lightening
speed Birdson corrals them into a corner It takes all of
Peters skill to keep him at bay

MAYA
(dawning realization)

Peter let go of the chair

PETER
What

Birdson menacingly circles left then right

MAYA
LET GO OF THE CHAIR

As Birdson makes another thrust towards them Maya suddenly
jerks the chair away clearing a path for Birdsons knife to
hit Peters abdomen

Peter SCREAMS bracing himself for the impact an impact that
never comes

Birdson freezes stopping the thrust millimeters from Peters
stomach Hes caught in an unseen trap paralyzed

MAYA (CONTD)
(insistent)
He cant hurt you

In that split second Peter realizes Mayas right He takes
the chair and SMASHES Birdson in the head Birdson goes
down Peter kicks him He doesnt move Peter grabs
Birdsons knife

PETER
(to Maya)
You okay

MAYA (0OS)
Whens your birthday

PETER
What

He looks back at Maya whos holding her upper arm Blood
begins to drip down her side Peter immediately grabs hold
of her hand carefully pushing her arm up in the air

PETER (CONTD)
Hang on get it up go on higher

MAYA
Your 33rd birthday The transformation
will be a perversion of Christs rising
from the dead Townsend discovered it
in one of Lareauxs books

Peter goes to the window grabs one of the lightweight
curtains and uses the knife to shred a piece He takes it
and bandages Mayas arm

MAYA (CONTD)
Itll happen at the exact time of your
birth

PETER
(he stops)
That cant be right
(as he ties off the dressing)
My birthdays tomorrow

With Peter and Maya in the foreground we see although they
dont that Birdson sits up his eyes open staring at a
point above Maya and Peter A horrible rictus smile moves
across his face Birdsons eyes roll back into his head
until only white remains Then he begins to jerk
uncontrollably his face contorting into one frightening
expression after the next Peter grabs the fish knife
moving in front of Maya

Birdsons limbs begin to torque out of control He convulses
on the floor then suddenly sits up closer to camera His
eyes roll back down into a normal position His face becomes
calm He looks at Peter and Maya A horrified look crosses
Birdsons face as his arm rotates backwards bones snapping
and muscles ripping

Involuntarily spewing from Birdson in ever-changing animal
like voices

BIRDSON

(in Latin)
My demon of anguish help me create
confusion and suffering forever and
ever and ever(geni tormentorum
mihi commoventi perturbationem
miseriamque in saaecula saeculorum in
saecula saeculorum in saecula

Birdsons head turns on his neck in unnatural manner his
body still convulsing As he stops speaking his head snaps
back around so hes facing Peter and Maya

Suddenly the chandelier above them flickers the globes
EXPLODING and showering them with shards of glass Birdsons
entire body begins to vibrate urine seeping out from beneath
him Then horrifyingly a horn like protusion begins to
push out from the upper edge of Birdsons head growing
straininguntil finally the horn BURSTS through blowing his
head apart Birdson falls back onto the floor And as
Birdson finally dies Peter looks at the corpse then drops
heavily onto an arm of a chair Drained Maya sits next to
him They lean against one another together in trauma

MAYA
He couldnt stop us and thats how he
was punished

overwhelmed)

Highways dark except for Peters headlights as they roll
up and down a hilly back road Trees lean in on both sides

Up ahead the road begins to parallel a lake Glimpses of
black water can be seen through the trees She powers down
her window to get some air Maya looks over at Peter His
face appears normal Then she seems to hear a soft sound -
GASPING FOR BREATH Then

The car suddenly drifts into the other lane heading straight
for a guard rail which outlines the lake Instinctively
Maya lunges for the steering wheel

MAYA (CONTD)
Watch it

She manages to twist it just enough so the car misses the
rail but careens off the road

The car RIPS through the bushes with an EXPLOSIVE ROAR and
SKIDS down the bank and plunges into the lake below And we

Just past midnight A small dirty white stucco and wood
country mart The only light is a stark household flood

TWO PEOPLE leave the market carrying a six pack and a few
munchies They hop into their car and take off

And at the edge of the lot Peters car is parked
INT COUNTRY MARKET

Peter and Maya SNAP the lids of their coffees Somewhere a
radio is ON Maya moves to the AGING CASHIER as Peter walks
over to a wall of generic first-aid remedies HE grabs the
largest band-aids there And as he joins Maya at the
counter we see its the cashiers radio

and bangs it open inside of the register

Peter and Maya sit on the edge of the curb sipping coffee
Maya pulls out her cigarettes and lights up She offers him
the pack He gratefully takes one lights up and inhales

PETER
Why did you lie to me about your
parents deaths

MAYA
I was desperate I knew you wrote about
murders I needed a way in
Suddenly a car motors toward them Just as a DEER decides to
cross the two-lane road The cars HIGH BEAMS startle the
deer it stops snaps a stunned look at Peter and Maya A
moment of stillness then it gallops to safety just as the
car speeds by Suddenly quiet again

PETER
Close call For the first time ina
long time its really hitting me
Lifes tenuous

MAYA

I know it is Right after my parents
died I went to the beach

(short intake of breath)
I was in the water Everything was
calm And then one of those really big
waves hit me Hard Pulled me straight
to the bottom I struggled and finally
ran out of air

(gulps air)
If it hadnt been for my sister who
pulled me out I wouldve drowned
Legally dead for a couple of minutes is
what they told me

PETER
No oxygen to the brain

MAYA
Maybe thats my problem

Why didnt you just go along with

He SNAPS on the light Silent Stuffy He opens a window

MAYA

INT BEDROOM

Peters box of records is on the bed where he left it The
ancient news articles are scattered Some fallen onto the
floor

Peter picks everything up as Maya sifts the contents on the
bed We see passing glimpses of a passport bankbooks
insurance policies a will a set of keys and then a
parchment copy of Peters birth certificate Maya picks it
up

CLOSE ON

Time of Peters birth is 455 PM

PETER
I dont know Extra apartment keys
Whats it matter

MAYA
(desperate)
Maybe I should check Lareauxs book
Its in the car Be right back Dont
go anywhere

PETER
Sure

Maya leaves the room Moments later Peter hears the front
door open and close Doesnt move then suddenly ina
flurry of anger he knocks the phone off the bedside table
A lamp flies off with it Then he stands and sweeps his arm
across the top of his bureau knocking off pictures moments
a jewelry box Turning he flips over a chair and kicks it
viciously
Breathing hard he slumps back on the bed Across the room
he sees a picture of Claire has slipped partially behind the
bureau Its glass has shattered and only half her face is
visible

Peter immediately picks it up Stares down at this smiling
girlfriend He lays it carefully back on the bureau trying
to regain some control He breathes deep then begins
gathering everything back on to the bed He looks at the set
of keys Picks them up Compares them with his own set

Trying to think he stares out his bedroom window at the
building ledge across the way He SEES the potted geraniums
now arranged a simple red flourish

Then a light snaps on in the apartment below and as he looks
down noticing it his eyes shift a momentary realization
and he looks back down at the keys and leaves his apartment

INT ELEVATOR

Peter gets on He looks at the unknown keys again Then
pushes the button for the fourth floor

INT APT 4-A - NIGHT

Peter knocks softly on the door Then more loudly No
response He tries on of the new keys slowly giving it a
turn It works He tries the lower lock The click of this
key is audible as

INT APT 4-A

The door swings open to a dark apartment Peter stands
warily at the door then flips on the lights Nothing there
No furniture No occupance

Peter steps in and closes the door He looks around at the
emptiness A cockroach scurries across the floor in front of
him

INT LIVING ROOM
He walks through the living room and
INT BEDROOM

Only a small table and lamp have been left in the corner
Peter switches on the lamp He notices the ceilings been
dropped A grid of white tile panels held by a lightweight
metal frame He stares at it

Very slowly he raises the broom upward and pokes on of the
panels It moves easily He pushes harder and manages to
angle the panel sliding it back so that some of the
original ceiling is visible He sees
A lurid splash of color a tiny fragment of white line and
part of a strange design

Peter stares hard at it He grabs the small table from the
corner and drags it to the center of the room Standing on

it he can now easily reach the tiles with his hands

He SMASHES the panels loose KNOCKING THEM OUT and dropping
them on the floor Two three four more tiles Then five

TIME JUMP CUT TO

The floor below him is littered with ceiling tiles Peter
looks up at

The door of Apt 4-A is thrown open Peter takes off
leaving the door ajar behind him

INT PETERS APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
The front door is thrown open Peter steps in to see

Maya standing slightly tense talking to somebody The
other VOICE is obscured by the sound of a garbage truck
moving down the street And as Peter moves farther inside
past the door he sees

Claire sitting on the overstuffed chair

CLAIRE
(gets up)
There you are My God darling Ive
been so worried Are you alright

PETER
Claire

CLAIRE
This is the personyou were talking
about

MAYA

Where were you
Peter holds out the keys to Claire ignoring Maya

PETER
Whatre these

CLAIRE
I dont know What are they

PETER
I found them in your file box

CLAIRE
Must be a spare set

PETER
I thought the spare set was in the
kitchen drawer

PETER (CONTD)
(to Claire)
You were hiding them

Claire gets up moving to Peter and reaches to embrace him
He lets it happen but doesnt reciprocate

CLAIRE
Honey youre exhausted Do you want to
lie down for a little while

PETER
(moving across the room)
I found the pentacle

Mayas eyes widen with alarm She turns quickly toward
Claire whos watching them And as Peter follows Mayas
stare in one slow move Claire pulls a Beretta from a drawer
in the aquarium table She points the gun directly at Maya

CLAIRE
Shes been stalking you Peter

PETER
So youre going to kill her Put the
gun down Claire

Claire ignores him but before she can make her move Peter
has grabbed her wrist twisting her back into the living
room trying to pull the gun out of her hand Claire wrests
free of Peter

CLAIRE
Listen to me I love you Peter Im
trying to protect you

PETER
You really had me going Claire I was

finally ready to propose to you

CLAIRE
Were still going to be together

CLAIRE (CONTD)
Theres nothing you can do about it
(to Maya)
Ive fucking had it with you

She lunges at Maya one powerful move but as she does Maya
moves out of the way And as Maya spins around Claire goes
for her again but she trips on the wet floor losing her
balance As Peter grabs to catch her she crashes horribly
through the glass shelves

Peter is horrified

Then he walks to Claire and pulls the gun from her lifeless
hand Maya and Peter stare at each other in shock for a
moment Then Mayas pager sounds She checks the number and
goes to the phone and dials As she does Peter pulls a
blanket off the sofa and covers Claires body

MAYA
Hi its me Whats going on

She listens and her expression changes to one of relief
She hangs up the phone and turns to Peter

MAYA (CONTD)

As the sunlight prisms on dew-covered grass Peter and Maya
pull into the seminary parking lot

INT FATHER LAREAUXS ROOM

A small crowd of priests including Father Frank is in the
room Several stand next to the bed blocking a clear view
of Father Lareaux Soft CLASSICAL MUSIC plays The mood is
upbeat As the door opens Father Frank sees Maya lead Peter
in by the arm like a puppet or a lost soul

FATHER FRANK
(vindictively)
Im glad youre here Theres something
you need to see

With only a cursory glance at Peter he leads Maya to the
bed The other priests move away Father Lareaux is sitting
up against his pillows He looks good rosy cheeked - almost
back to normal

LAREAUX
(happy to see her)
Miette

Maya throws her arms around his neck smiling for the first
time in a long time

MAYA
Father Thank God youre better I
really need your help Weve only got a
few more hours

LAREAUX
Dont worryabout the transformation
Maya

MAYA

What do you mean dont worry

LAREAUX

(being careful not to wound

her)
Well in my prayers I realized weve
been fooling ourselves and probably
blown this all out of proportion God
would never allow anything like that to
happen

Maya is floored Father Frank looks at her scornfully

FATHER FRANK
I told you this was myth all along

PETER
(confused)
Does that mean its over

Lareaux nods a yes at Peter as Maya sits on the old
priests bed Peter stands beside her

MAYA
Sowe won

LAREAUX
(sweet smile)
Yes We won thats right

Maya plays with her cross distractedly rocking it back and
forth between her fingers Lareaux re-fluffs his pillows
looking away from Maya moving slightly making himself more
comfortable

MAYA
We won because Christtriumphed over
Satan

LAREAUX

Um hm Thats right Maya
MAYA
So if Christ won that means what does
that mean Father That Satan

LAREAUX
(tenderly swallowing back
Would you like to rest Miette You
must be exhausted

Maya picks up a scapular from the dresser and moves in closer
to Lareaux

MAYA
(insistent)
So I guess Satan lost Satan is the
weak one

LAREAUX
(breath coming in shorter
bursts)
Miette come here and relax

Maya is crowding Lareaux now the scapular thrust almost
directly in his face

MAYA
(repeating monotone)
I can relax because Satan the coward
trembles before Christ right

Father Frank moves over to Maya with another Priest Sees
Lareaux is having trouble breathing

FATHER FRANK
All right Thats enough for now Hes
just recovering Take it easy Maya

But Maya resists their tugging arms leaning closer to
Lareaux

MAYA
But doesnt he tremble Father Doesnt
he cower like a frightened jackal
Satan the half-wit

Maya continues taunting her cross dangling over Lareaux
MAYA (CONTD)
(as slowly as she can)
The whimpering slave of Christ The

impotent dog on Gods leash

Maya thrusts the scapular onto Father Lareauxs forehead He
recoils violently as though burned

The entire room stares transfixed at Lareaux Maya look at
peter then Father Frank as she moves carefully off the bed

INT FATHER LAREAUXS ROOM - SHORT TIME LATER

A nervous Father Frank is supervising the Jesuits as they
empty Lareauxs room of its extraneous contents He avoids
looking at Maya Father Lareaux sits calmly in a chair at
the center of the room None of the Jesuits meet his eye
One Priest tapes the curtains closed over the window A lamp
provides the only light

You have to be experienced to do this
Just wait outside Otherwise you risk

Maya looks at him then clasps his hand briefly She breaks
off and walks over to Father Frank

Father Thomas makes the Sign of the Cross Then he places
the tip of his stole on Lareauxs neck and his right hand on

Lareauxs head Maya and the younger Priests are kneeling
just behind Father Thomas overwhelmed

LAREAUX
Gotcha

The lamp immediately goes out Room is pitch black

FATHER THOMAS
Jeremy the door

We hear FUMBLING grunting

FATHER JEREMY
ItI cant

FATHER THOMAS
(continue subbing in Latin)
Lowly beast through the power of
Christ Let the door re-open

VOICES begin MOCKING speeded up versions of sentences
weve heard before LATIN and ENGLISH

LAREAUX
(in Peters voice)
Go on Do something Show me
(in Mayas voice)
Im scared Im slipping back
A beat Then a normal voice

PETER
Maya

A TORRENT OF PROFANITY drowns him out A thousand voices
young and old crying cursing filling the air with hatred
and spite Amidst this hurricane of sound the lights begin
to flicker at ultra-high speed creating a strobe effect

The window bursts open flooding the room with light Father
Jeremy races over and struggles to close it but cannot

Maya is revealed praying eyes open Peter and Father
Malcolm are crouched near the door A terrified Father
Thomas is bravely standing holding his crucifix in front of
himself facing Lareaux Or where Lareaux was The chair is
empty Amid the deafening noise Peter sees

Lareaux rise up behind Maya and encircle her throat with his
hands as the HELLISH VOICES reach a crescendo Lareaux
begins to sing softly

LAREAUX
Rock-a-bye baby on a tree top

Peter leaps to pull Lareaux off her but the aging priest
surprised Peter by grabbing him and hold him at bay

As Peter struggles Lareauxs expression shifts His
confidence vanishes and pain distorts his features Lareaux
falls to the floor in agony

Maya and Peter bend down to help him but the noise makes it
impossible for them to hear one another Maya pulls open
Lareauxs collar to try to get him more air and in that
instant the VOICES STOP The lights POP on Maya leans
close to Lareaux whos dying on the floor MUMBLING
incoherently And on Lareauxs forehead we see incisions
resembling strange unknown letters Like theyve been cut
from within The incisions are repeated on the backs of
Lareauxs hands The room is so cold steam pops off the
breath Father Thomas moves fast beginning the last rites
in Latin He makes the sign of the Cross on Lareauxs
forehead then

FATHER THOMAS
(to Lareaux in Latin)
Confiterisne vitia tua ante omnipotentem
deum (Do you confess your sins before
almighty God)

LAREAUX
the ark sank the sun set the ark
sank again

MAYA
(desperately)
Father please dont die
LAREAUX
(in great suffering)
art sank sun set ark sank again

Maya leans down inches from the dying priest Peter moves
beside her

MAYA
Father

For a split second Lareaux surfaces from his confusion and
looks at her with a great kindness

LAREAUX
Ensemble pour toujours quoi quil
arrive

As he dies Maya is momentarily inert tears of exhaustion
Shes devastated And we HEAR a single GRACE NOTE laced with
an intake of BREATH as we

SMASH CUT TO
INT CORRIDOR OUTSIDE LAREAUXS ROOM

Its CHAOS as Jesuits rush in and out of the cell helping
the exorcism participants Father Frank glares at Maya as
he helps clear the room

PETER
(looking down at Maya)
I thought you were in danger

Maya backs away from Lareaux who is being covered with a
white sheet A last glance and then she takes off with
Peter

INT RANGE ROVER

Maya looks straight ahead trying to shake off her fear
Peter looks at Maya moved by her Puts an arm around her
shoulder a momentary intimacy then he pulls away Finally
Maya looks at Peter

MAYA
Ill be all right
(reflective)
Peter at the very end I think Father
was back I saw it in his eyes

PETER
So what does it mean The ark sank and
the sun set

MAYA
Hes been repeating that since Birdsons
exorcism I looked in every passage in
the Bible and theres nothing about an
ark or a sunset that tells us anything

PETER
What did he say to you in French

MAYA
Thats his I dont know his
grounding phrase for me together no
matter what

PETER
(deep sigh)
Terrific

EXT NEWARK NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY

The Range Rover enters a blue-collar residential part of the
city old townhouses on both sides of the street The
traffic is heavy and the Rover slows pulling to the curb

INT RANGE ROVER
Peter studies Maya admiring her in some new way

MAYA
He was trying to tell me something

PETER
(cynical)
And his message was Together no
matter what

A car pulls up alongside them The driver a middle-aged
WOMAN rolls down her window and calls out to Peter

WOMAN
Helloooo - do you live around here
(Peter ignores her)
How do I get to the turnpike

The car behind her HONKS impatiently

IRKED MOTORIST
THERES FIVE FUCKING CARS BEHIND YOU
ASSHOLE

Peter turns to the woman

PETER
(doesnt give a shit)
Lady I dont know

Offended the woman drives off Peter turns back to Maya
whos suddenly grabbed Townsends Bible and furiously flips
through it
MAYA
Wait a minute The message He used
French he knew he couldnt say it
directly The arc sank or cing cri
n-q Its French for five The sun

set or pronounced like sept The
French word for seven The arc sank
again

(then)
Its five-seven-fie Book chapter and
verse

She finally stops at a specific section she was looking for

MAYA (CONTD)
Book five Deuteronomy chapter seven
verse five
(reads)
But this shall you deal with them You
shall break down their altars and burn
their graven images with fire

PETER
And whats that mean

She knows
EXT GAS STATION - AFTERNOON

The Range Rover pulls up Peter gets out Hes got a five
gallon gas can Maya enters the gas station MINI-MART A
clock reads 405 Afternoon NEWS plays on a TV

NEWSCASTER
An international group of scientists
will assemble in Geneva later this week
in an attempt to determine the cause of
diminishing daylight a phenomenon which
has baffled the worlds finest
scientific minds In local news the
case of accused killer George Viznick

Maya hands the clerk some money and glances outside at Peter
filling the gas can

EXT SAINT BENEDICTUS - AFTERNOON

It looks quiet and serene in the afternoon light Peter and
Maya approach carefully They see a collection of cars in
front of the church Unkempt and dirty a few pedestrians
stare at them The gas bumps conspicuously against Mayas
thigh

EXT SAINT BENEDICTUS - SIDE ENTRANCE
Peter pulls out Claires gun They step inside
INT SAINT BENEDICTUS - CONTINUOUS

Peter and Maya pass through the vestry and edge their way
into the main cathedral A MASS is in progress A lay
READER has memorized the text

READER
God appears and God is light to those
pour souls who dwell in night

Peter and Maya move in suddenly from the vestry onto the
altar behind the reader Mayas shocked by the packed-to
capacity church The crowd inside immediately switch their
focus to Maya and then to Peter whos just moved up onto the
altar standing unknowingly directly under the CROSS

READER (CONTD)
But does a human form display

The reader sees the stares from the crowd stops and turns
to Maya and Peter The reader is wearing a small inverted
cross around her neck

READER (CONTD)
Welcome

In the crowd Maya sees the little girl from the diner Maya
is stunned The little girl catches Mayas glance giving
her a sly smile and then looks away Her mother appears
beside her Unnerved Maya looks at Peter desperate

MAYA
Eight minutes

Then the priest at the front of the church standing quietly
next to the reader turns slowly toward Peter oddly very
calm And we see its Father James He smiles Charming
gracious

FATHER JAMES
(looking at gas can)
Did you really think you could just burn
the church down That some ritualistic
hocus pocus could just end this

Alarmed Peter looks at Maya but her gaze is locked on
James Then Peter glances down at the dripping gasoline can
in Mayas hand and as she sets it down

FATHER JAMES (CONTD)
Lareaux was never free of us He led
you here
(he starts to sing softly)
Get me to the church on time
Peter moves toward James putting the gun to his uncles
head

PETER
(barely able to stand it)
You fucking bastard

FATHER JAMES
Dont you get it

(re Maya)
They had their 2000 years Now its
our turn
PETER
So all that bullshit about God and
faith

FATHER JAMES
It was perfect The harder I pushed
the more you pulled away

PETER
(beyond anger beyond tears)
You lied to me my whole life
Everything you said everything you did

FATHER JAMES
Everything I did I did for you I love
you Peter Think of it Im giving
you a gift absolute power and
knowledge

PETER
You raised me like a son

FATHER JAMES
You are my son Dont you see the
opportunity that lies before you

PETER
(putting it together)
You killed my parents

FATHER JAMES
I had to There was no other way
Their deaths were part of the greatest
legacy I could have given you
Peter moves the muzzle of the gun into James carotid artery
CLOSE ON MAYA

The realization floods her

MAYA
Dont Thats what they want
FATHER JAMES
It will be my ultimate sacrifice

MAYA
If you commit murder you accept evil

One by one people in the congregation begin to rise Peter
cant believe what he sees Susan and Mrs Quintana

Stunned Peter lets the gun lower a moment and then as he
turns back to Maya hes too late

James has moved behind Maya holding a long-bladed knife at
her throat James anchors it at her neck forming a
shimmering upside down Cross Runic symbols carved into the
Sterling handle

Peter pivots pulling up the gun again aiming it back at
James

PETER
Drop the knife

He cocks the gun

FATHER JAMES
Shes going to die right in front of
you

Peter looks at Maya Her expression gives him the permission
to do the unthinkable

MAYA
(softly)
Let him kill me

Peters thrown off Maya lets her eyes blink closed Fora
moment no one moves The knife glints off the stained
glass

CLOSE ON
Peter Thinking Unraveling

FATHER JAMES
(big smile)
You have no idea how much you look like
your mother right now

Peter FIRES an ECHOING REPORT bouncing from the Cathedral
ceiling to the Travertine floor Father James falls
mortally wounded

WILLIAM
And you thought I was the family fuck
up
Peter sees William approaching from the pews

WILLIAM (CONTD)
Thank you Maya You served us well

Stunned Peter gulps a mouthful of air lifts his gun and
shoots William in the eye Immediate The bullet powers
through William lodging in Mrs Quintana She COUGHS up a
GURGLING choke eyes wide And as she dies gripping her
neck she doubles over the back of a wooden pew

e crowd reacts Maya grabs hold of Peter edging him back
oward the vestry and out of the church As the Congregation
tarts to press forward Peter swings the gun back up and out
oward them It glistens off the Chalices They stop wary
nd as Maya and Peter finally turn their backs on the crowd

INT VESTRYSAINT BENEDICTUS

Through the vestry and out the back door
EXT STREET - DUSK

Peter and Maya sprint for the Rover

INT RANGE ROVER

Peter and Maya speed up the street They turn the corner and
continue up a street undergoing construction Fenced by
sawhorse barricades its equipped with flashing warning
lights

PETER
How much time do we have

MAYA
Not a lot

Peter races past the barricades side-swiping the steel
sawhorses then suddenly he slams on the brakes skidding to
a rough stop nowhere to go

INT RANGE ROVER

Peter looks at Maya then at the gun in his lap and back at
her Conflicted emotions He picks up the revolver Maya
stares at Peter A huge fear rips through her body Peter
hesitates Then hands her the gun

PETER
If you can do itgo ahead

Maya puts the gun down lLeans over and embraces him They
hold onto each other A shared intimacy unknown to either
of them
MAYA
(a desperate whisper)
Im not strong enough for this

Peter reaches over and tenderly brushes the hair away from
Mayas face Then Maya pulls away raising the tiny gun and
TIME slows to a crawl

Maya holds the Beretta The strain etched on her face her
hands shake her eyes well up Peter waits watching her
Shes unsure We HEAR a choked back breath Gasping lungs
looking for air The struggle for life

The car clock seems frozen on 454 Finally it turns over
and

Nothing happens
Peters looking at her He knows Hes sure of it

PETER
It didnt work Maya Im okay

Peter reaches for her his face radiant joyful alive She
doesnt move a muscle The gun barrel doesnt quiver

MAYA
Oh Peter

PETER
(changed tone)
Its me Put the gun down Maya

Tears roll down her face as she cocks the Beretta
PETER (CONTD)
If you really think Im the Devil then

shoot me

Out of the corner of her eye Maya sees the clock - its hands
rapidly spin backward

EXT RANGE ROVER

A HIGH ANGLE of the car from above A SHOT RIPS through the
air Then one more Maya exits the car Shes unsteady on
her feet The camera pans up into the night sky

SILENCE

Followed by a low-pitched disturbing rumble A kind of
GROTESQUE GROAN Then some HUM is heard Static A not
