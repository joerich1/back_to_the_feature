CAPE motherfucking COD

EXT BEACH PARKING LOT - SUNNY DAY

Clogged with doughy tourists bulging out of their
bathing suits A long line of cars waiting to park
snakes out onto the main road In the distance we
HEAR the persistent sound of a STUCK CAR HORN getting
louder

A BRAND NEW BMW barrels past the line of waiting
cars Steam billows from its severely dented grill

With no regard for anyone the Beamer swerves in
front of an old lady and skids to a stop across the
last two handicap spaces

JIM SIMMERS calmly exits the vehicle and begins
to peel off his robe and pyjamas one piece at a time
as he marches towards a trash can

He’s down to his underwear as he snatches a newspaper
out of the PARKING ATTENDANTS hand and buck naked by
the time he squats into the trash can to take a shit
It’s a scene man He’s folded in half ass
submerged in the trash can knees dangling over the
side Jim flips to the sports page seemingly
unaware of the slack-jawed GAWKERS crowded around

The STUCK CAR HORN in the background is accented by a
short GRUNT of relief as Jim finishes

He struggles to get out of the can then pushes past
the horrified crowd bee-lining for the ocean Naked
as a jaybird he strides purposefully into the cold
waters of the Atlantic

The wailing CAR HORN rises in CRESCENDO as we

CUT TO

CLOSE ON A POT OF BOILING WATER FOR NO GOOD REASON

EXT JIM’S APARTMENT - MORNING

Jim peeks out Looks around The coast is clear
But the second he steps onto the sidewalk A BIG
ASSHOLE DOG - the same one whose barking woke him
earlier - menaces him

Jim stands motionless while the four-legged
cocksucker barks maniacally at him

THE GAY NEIGHBOR a short shaved-bald fireplug of a
dude steps outside

JIM
A little help here
THE GAY NEIGHBOR
I’m so sorry I don’t know why

(to the dog)
Hoag David Hoag you come here

David Hoag trots back to his owner

JIM
I don’t wanna sound like a broken
record here but you kind of
promised to keep him locked up

The Gay Neighbor ignores him fixated on a string

dangling from his dog’s ass

THE GAY NEIGHBOR

INT CONVENIENCE STORE - CONTINUOUS

Jim places a newspaper on the counter while a HOT YOUNG
CLERK rambles on the phone ignoring him

HOT YOUNG CLERK
First he fucks the shit out of me
then beats the shit out of me
which would be fine if I wasn’t the
one smuggling his crack into prison
when I’m visiting his brother
Shit it’s not like he’s gonna help
me get my baby back from the
Jamaican assholes we met at the
rage

Jim is both intrigued and embarrassed by her
conversation

JIM
Can I please--
(she holds up her finger)
Can I please--
(finger goes up again)
Look I just need--

HOT YOUNG CLERK
(into the phone)
Hold on one second Juno
(to Jim)
Here

She punches a few buttons on the lottery machine and
shoves the resulting tickets at Jim

HOT YOUNG CLERK
Five quick picks two megabucks and
a daily double 0-5-0-8 and one
Cape Cod Times

Jim pays her and snatches his shit irked
HOT YOUNG CHICK
You might as well burn your money

Jim heads out
EXT VALID INSURANCE BUILDING - DAY

Jim pulls up to a nondescript multi-story “God
please kill me” office building

INT VALID INSURANCE - FIRST FLOOR - DAY

An endless sea of cubicles filled with people doing
things and saying things we couldn’t care less about
Jim makes his way to Cubicle 18-C and takes a seat
He opens his top drawer and pulls out a lottery
ticket Checks the numbers against the results in
the newspaper

Jim sighs No luck

As he settles in and puts on his headset a familiar
scent catches his attention

JIMS POV

as OLIVIA - curvy gorgeous wafting sensuality -
glides up the stairs to the SECOND TIER

Her ass is fucking perfect Seriously Her ass is
actually perfect and there’s nothing Jim can do about
it
JILL Six years later and you’re still

infatuated
Jim turns
IN THE CUBICLE DIRECTLY ADJACENT TO HIS --
JILL SUMMERS (early 30’s) - hip chunky vibrant
ballsy - sits with her feet on her desk and an
unplugged electric guitar in her lap

JIM
You really wanna start

She motions for him to hold on
JILL
(into headset)
Yes ma’am I understand

She mouths to Jim “I don’t understand”
JILL (CONTD)
(into headset)
Yes ma’am I understand

Jill mutes the headset

JILL (CONTD)
Forty three seconds till the coffee
rush Hold my spot if you beat me

JIM
I always beat you

Jill un-mutes the headset

JILL
(into headset)
Can you hold while I look up your
policy Thank you

Jill punches the hold button and takes off
Jim is about to follow but

He’s interrupted by an annoying BUZZING from his desk
phone

CO-WORKER (0S)
(exasperated)
Jim I’ve got a woman on line nine--
she justshe won’t fucking listen
to reason Any chance you can help
me out here

JIM
Not a problem

CO-WORKER (0S)
Thanks man I appreciate it

Jim punches a button unleashing the Kraken

JIM
(into headset)
Valid Insurance Jim Simmers
speaking How may I be of ass--

The woman on the other end immediately launches into
a hysterical tirade Her words are indecipherable
but her rage is unmistakable

JIM
Okay slow down a minute Does the
letter indicate the reason for the
termination of your policy
Her response is another forty-five second burst of
insane chattering

INT COPY ROOM - FIFTEEN MINUTES LATER

A bored CO-WORKER stands over the open copy machine
hitting the “start” button over and over seemingly
hypnotized by the moving light

Jim approaches with a stack of papers still dealing
with the customer Jim covers the microphone on his
headset

JIM
(to Bored Co-Worker)
Uh you mind

The Bored Co-Worker snaps out of his trance and
steps aside

JIM
(into headset)
I agree with you ma’am Now if
you would just give me your policy
number I can--

Jim runs off copies while the woman runs her mouth

INT FILE ROOM - FIFTEEN MINUTES LATER

Two lazy co-workers SCHOOLEY and McCORKLE stand
around gossiping

MCCORKLE
so I got three fingers in
right And the chick leans right
into my ear and says “more” and
I’m like “honey any more and I’m
not gonna be able to drive the
van”

His buddy laughs Their moment of bullshitting is
interrupted when Jim approaches His headset is
still buzzing with the irked customer

JIM
(into headset)
Ma’am can you hold on a second
(to Schooley and McCorkle)
Uh guys I’ve gotta get in there

The two slackers shoot him a dismissive look and walk
off
SCHOOLEY
Whatever you say Captain Overtime

As Jim searches through the files

JIM
Ma’‘am I really want to help but

INT OFFICE KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

Jim gets in line at the coffee maker JILL already
has her coffee and Jim doesn’t and that’s funny to
her She smirks

JILL
Sucker

He points to his headset manages a sheepish smile

JIM
(into headset)
I understand that it runs in your
family however your child does
weigh in excess of four hundred
pounds so--

Jim has to pull the headset away when the woman
screeches at him

JILL
Dude hang up Life’s too short

But Jim is committed Plus he’s next in line for
coffee right behind

BLAKE HENDERSON 29 (but says he’s 27) an
overconfident overachieving dick The kind of guy
who has a big ass coffee cup that says “BIG ASS CUP”
on the side

Jim watches in horror as Blake dumps his lukewarm
coffee into the sink and pours the last of the fresh
coffee into his “big cup” He shakes the pot to
ensure that he’s literally taken every last drop

BLAKE
(gun-points at Jim and says)
Fuck right I did

Blake struts off leaving Jim with an empty pot and an
angry customer
JIM
(into headset exasperated)
Please please please just tell
me what I can do to make this--

CLICK Jim snatches the fucking headset off his
fucking head

JIM
Fuck

He catches Jill smirking from across the room

Jim sighs and starts on a new pot He sorts through
the various brands of shit

JIM
No Starbucks

In the trash lay the last empty bag of Starbucks
Jim holds up seven brands of crap Maxwell House
Folgers Munter’s Brown Roast etc

VOICE OVER LOUD SPEAKER (0S)
Jim Simmers please report to Mr
Whiteman’s office

He hurriedly selects the bag of Munter’s Brown®
starts the maker on “quick brew”

JILL
Why don’t you just grab a cup up on
the second tier

JIM
It doesn’t work like that Jill
Just because Mr Whiteman called me
to his office doesn’t mean I have
second tier privileges

JILL
Dude The White Man’s not calling
you up there to chit-chat he’s
calling you up to promote And
youre the most promotable guy I
know

JIM
I don’t know about the most
promotable but I’ve definitely
done the work

The coffee brews oh so slowly Excruciating Jim
checks his watch

JILL
Youve got it coming Jim Don’t
worry

The coffee machine CHIRPS But now Jim wants to
ensure that he has the “right” cup Each time he
picks one up he puts it back choosing another

JIM

(intense)
I feel like this has to happen you
know I feel like I’ve done
everything that I’m supposed to do
and I’ve waited as long as I
possibly canit has to happen
today

JILL

Easy turbo

Finally Jill grabs a cup for Jim and pours

JILL
It’s just a promotion--

JIM
It’s a career Jill It’s a job
now but it becomes a career by the
end of the day It has to

JILL
Right Or I’m sure you’1l kill
everyone here
She punches him playfully in the arm and walks away
Jim steels himself takes a sip of his coffee
disgusting Pours it out

INT MR WHITEMAN’S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

Mr Whiteman sits behind his desk a serious look
etched upon his serious face Jim enters ebullient

MR WHITEMAN
(somber )
Jim
It’s all therein that one word His face drops

JIM
No

MR WHITEMAN
This wasn’t easy

JIM
No

Blake enters smugly sipping Starbucks from his Big
Ass Cup

BLAKE
Yeah

MR WHITEMAN
Look we deliberated for a long
time It was torturous You guys
were both eminently qualified

JIM
Then why Honestly why

BLAKE
Don’t do it to yourself Jim

MR WHITEMAN
He’s right Accept it Jim
Simmers because this is how it is

JIM
No offense to Blake but I’ve been
here longer my output is higher I
work harder than anyone I know
This doesn’t make any sense Tell
me why

MR WHITEMAN
Jim what so many people on Earth
don’t understand

BLAKE
--don’t even fathom

MR WHITEMAN
is that so much of life is based
on popularity

JIM
Are you kidding

MR WHITEMAN
No Blake is more popular than
you and I think that counts for
something

Silence Jim gnaws on his lip Mr Whiteman notices
Jim’s hand clenching

JIM
I need to leave early today

MR WHITEMAN
I think that’s a good idea

BLAKE

Yeah I just need you to do one
little thing before you leave

INT JIM’S CUBICLE - DAY

Blake plops a big ass stack of files on Jim’s desk
He gives Jim the gun point and walks off

EXT CORDDRY HOUSE - EVENING

Jim pulls up and approaches the most perfect house in
this perfect neighborhood

We HEAR birds CHIRPING sprinklers SPRINKLINGand
the SOUNDS of a violent struggle inside Jim knocks

INT CORDDRY HOUSE - EVENING

REBECCA CORDDRY a sweet-faced dainty buttercup
answers

REBECCA
Jim

Rebecca is the spitting image of a 1950s housewife

JIM
Hey Becca Is Rob

Horrible SCREAMS emanate from inside the home
JIM (CONTD)
(re the sounds)
Well I guess he is home

REBECCA
Come on in

INT CORDDRY LIVING ROOM - EVENING

A perfect little suburban living room Jim sits on
the couch Rebecca sits across from him

REBECCA
He’1l be with you in a minute he’s
just putting Junior down

THE HALLWAY that connects to this living room is
alive with the SOUNDS of SOME HORRIBLE FIGHT Jim
looks sees nothing

REBECCA
So how’ve you been
JIM
Eh It’s all been kind of “eh”

lately
Then we see it at the end of the hallway

ROB CORDDRY five foot six 152 pounds of wiry
persistence clamps a choke hold around the neck of
his stepson JUNIOR 14 a massive construct of rage
and retardation

The fight SLAMS them out of view
JIM AND REBECCA

continue with their small talk

JIM
SoI bet you’re glad to have Rob
home
REBECCA

I am Whenever hes gone Junior
and I count the days until the off
season

JIM
I bet

Not much to talk about
DOWN THE HALL

Junior charges out backwards slamming Rob into a wall
until further rewrites

JIM GRINS AT REBECCA
They struggle for a topic

JIM
Sodo you guys have plans for
while he’s home

REBECCA
He’s just back so we haven’t
really made any plans
(taps Jims leg)

REBECCA (CONTD)
I know he can’t wait to go out with
the guys though

Jim sighs

JIM
Yep The guys out on the Cod

From deep within the bowels of this home we hear

ROB (0S)
AAHH OH FUCK MY GOD FUCK MY GOD

REBECCA
You know what maybe you oughta go
on back and give him a hand

Jim stands Rebecca hands him a baseball bat

CUT TO

INT THE BEACHCOMBER BAR - NIGHT

A local dive with a tropical theme Rob has bandages
over his eye the pain in his damaged sternum is
excruciating as he tries to sit

Rob pounds the bar tears welling in his eyes

ROB
Oh motherfuck

JIM
(concerned)
He’s really gotten big Rob

ROB
AHHH He’s--OH FUCK

Rob is in so much pain he has to smash a glass on the
floor

ROB
I’ve gotta stand I can’t sit
man
(takes a breath)
Yeah the boy’s gotten big Each
time I come home it’s like he’s
grown another three inches

JIM
Uh doesn’t that kindascare you

ROB
No the doctor said his rage will
wain as he gets older

ROB (CONTD)
Really my main concern is the
weight set that Becca bought him
I swear it’s like he’s training
you know I mean he broke my
choke-hold three times before I
could lock it in

JIM
He’s probably watching those
ultimate fights or something

ROB
(all sentimental)

I’m away so much it just kills me
I mean I’m sure deep down he’s a
good kidand Rebecca’s such a
great mom with such a great vagina
it’s like I wish I could put them
in a time capsule when I’m away

Then Rob looks at Jim suddenly and deeply worried
himself

ROB
Do you think he’s training Jim
Do you think he’s training to kill
me

Jim ponders the question is the retarded boy
training to kill his stepfather

JIM
Nah I mean you’ve only been his
stepdad for what five years

ROB
Six

JIM
Okay six The point is these
things take time He’ll come
around

LARRY (0S)
Rob

Jim and Rob turn to see LARRY WILLS 40’s decked out
in a tank-top flip flops and lifeguard shorts He’s
a beach parking lot attendant by day and thieving
playboy by day too

Larry is escorted by a MILF who hasn’t yet learned

INT JIM’S LIVING ROOM - TIME LAPSE

Jim lays on the couch submerged in a bout of
existential depression OUTSIDE HIS WINDOW the sun
goes up and down as the world turns Days pass Jim
doesn’t move half asleep half awake

Finally he sits up

REAL TIME

Jim picks up the remote with a sigh Turns on the
TV

THE TELEVISION is suddenly alive with Tom Cruise
TOM CRUISE
(from “Mission Impossible”)

Jim

The image JUMPS forward to an anguished close-up

TOM CRUISE
Why Jim Why

That’s weird Jim switches the channel Low and
behold

THE TELEVISION offers more Tom Cruise on this
channel

TOM CRUISE
(from “Jerry Maguire”)
Help me Help me help you Help
me help you

Jim switches the channel And again

TOM CRUISE
(from “All The Right Moves”)
Doesn’‘t this seem just a little bit
too crazy

JIM
Yes Yes it does

Jim changes the channel

THE TELEVISION wont stop It’s like Tom Cruise is
speaking directly to Jim

TOM CRUISE
(from “The Color of Money”)
It’s like a nightmare isn’t it

JIM
This is nuts

TOM CRUISE
Man it just keeps getting worse
and worse doesn’t it

Jim hits the remote And there he is again in tight
close-up

TOM CRUISE
(from “Days of Thunder” )
When I’m driving I got a guy on
the radio who talks to me I can’t
see him but he talks to me

JIM
So whats your point

The image FREEZES Jim changes the channel

TOM CRUISE
(from “Cocktail” )

Click

TOM CRUISE
(from “Magnolia” )
In this big game that we play -
LIFE - it’s not what you hope for
it’s not what you deserveit’s
what you TAKE

The image FREEZES Jim stares for a long moment
trying to process the universe’s code He hits the
remote one last time

EXT JIM’S HOUSE - MORNING

Jim exits the house lethargically dragging his
backpack behind him Within seconds that asshole
dog is upon Jim snarling and barking like the
asshole he is

Jim doesn’t slow doesn’t acknowledge the dog in any
way Just proceeds to his sporty KIA (with racing
stripe) and climbs in

a stop “THE REFLEX” continues to blare even as a
carload of judgemental TEENS pulls up beside him

They laugh at Jim They laugh at his gay music
Some even point at him while they do it Teens can
be so cruel So cruel

But it doesn’t affect Jim in the least And he’s
done waiting at this stupid light

He steps on the accelerator and zooms away

Opens the magazine to the centerfold and holds it up
The clerk is horrified

Jim tosses some bills on the counter and leaves

chair waiting for his turn to speak

He notices Jill in her cubicle talking to a customer
on the phone as she applies the final touches to a
pencil sketch

JILL

feeding Blake into a meat grinder

JIM

Hold on--hold on--hold on I just

Larry notices a big ass change jar and starts
stuffing his pockets He freezes when Maureen
enters wearing only a towel

An awkward beat Errant coins slip from his fists

LARRY
Um Jim can we deal with your
meltdown later

JIM

picked you up when you were drunk
or bailed you out of jail You

Jim throws Larry against the wall and digs through
his pockets Pulls out a pirate’s booty

JIM

Man-up and sell your cock with some
respect

Maureen isn’t even slightly phased

Rob is in his garage cleaning dried blood off of his
hooks and spiked clubs Larry and Jim enter

LARRY
Whoa That’s sick

ROB

(proud)
Yeah I designed it for the new
guys on the job Nothing worse
than seeing some noob half-spiking
his club in a wounded harp seal’s
head without making the kill shot
It’s almost cruel

Larry notices an instructional poster on the wall
detailing the proper way to kill baby seals

LARRY
I don’t know how you do it Rob
How can you look into that cute
little face and smash it How do
you smash their adorable little
faces off

ROB
Hey I’ve gotta support my family
And you know what it’s racist
against cows to care about harp
seals
JIM
(vexed by that fucked up sentence)
WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU TALKING
ABOUT

ROB

Cows are thinking creatures too
but no one minds killing them Why
are harp seals so special

(off the guys’ faces)
Cows make great pets and they’re
very protective unlike harp seals
that have a horrible side no one
ever sees

LARRY
(dead serious)
Come on Rob Don’t try to justify
your murder by player hating on
harp seals They don’t hurt anyone
and shit you do

ROB
Youre out of your element short
bus You wouldn’t believe what
I’ve seen those creatures do I’ve
seen that white fur covered in
bloodand not always their own

Before it can turn into an argument Jim jumps

JIM

JIM

other side and there Was Nothing

ROB

restraint at all Why not do
whatever you fucking want whenever

MONSTROUS GROANS rumble from inside the house

ROB

Meanwhile at the center of the party Blake has a
crowd of rich folk entranced

BLAKE
-and I’ve got a little poem that
I’d like to read in honor of this
occasion if I may

He unfolds a slip of paper and begins to read

BLAKE
“It’s easy to grin when your ship
comes in and you’ve got the stock
market beat But the man
worthwhile is the man who can
smile when his shorts are too
tight in the seat”

The crowd laughs haughtily Blake’s unearned
popularity is mind-numbing Olivia stands off to the

pylons going down the center Jim’s new beamer is
being cock-blocked by a FAMILY OF TOURISTS driving
half the speed limit

Nothing but open road in front of them

INT JIM’S BMW - CONTINUOUS
Jim rides the tourists’ bumper

JIM
Oh my God

He hits the horn

ROB
I don’t get it The speed limit is
65 why is this douchebag driving
40 miles an hour

LARRY
You know the speed “limit” isn’t
the speed “requirement” It’s the

limit It’s the fastest you’re
allowed to go So really this guy
is just choosing not to ride at
maximum capacity

ROB
Yeah but there are also speed
minimums It’s as unsafe to drive
slow on a highway as it is to drive

fast

LARRY
No No Rob No Slow is always
safer

ROB

You’re a retard just like my
boybut without the strength

JIM
Did you just call your stepkid a
retard
Robert gulps the last drop of the last Long Island

ROB

spade a spade as long as you
appreciate the spade

LARRY
(serious as a heart attack)
You’re a goddamn racist man And

Jim has had enough He pulls into the center of the
road to pass - the pylons strike his Beamer - THWACK
THWACK THWACK

An oncoming car forces him back into his lane

ROB

the road THWACK THWACK THWACK

SHKA-BANG

The Beamer strikes a SOLID pylon mangling the grill

The car horn WAILS stuck Steam wafts into the
atmosphere As the car limps to the breakdown
lane

LARRY
Some of them are filled with
concrete

A beat

Until Rob bursts out in a fit of uncontrollable
laughter

ROB
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH you

Whatever Jim jams the car into gear He stabs at
the radio switching stations

JIM

EXT OLD MONEY BEACH HOUSE - NIGHT

From off in the distance we hear it We hear it
coming

The horn

Jims new newly fucked up Beamer pulls in front of
the house horn blaring The back door opens
Before Larry can set both feet on the sidewalk Jim
tears off

Larry shakes his head Sighs Digs a clothespin

from his pocket clamps it on his nose and walks to
the front door

EXT ROB’S HOUSE - NIGHT
We see the silhouette of Rob’s massive son standing
on the roof screaming at the moon Not howling

screaming

JUNIOR
Moon Moooooooon

His screams meld with the sound of

Jims car horn The beamer pulls up Rob gets out
Jim tears off and leaves his friend to face his son

Alone

ROB
MOOOOOOON

Junior turns away from the moon and locks eyes with
Rob He squints ‘oh yeah it’s on’

Rebecca comes out with a roll of tape Rob holds out
his hands so she can tape his knuckles

INT JIM’S HOUSE - NIGHT

bedroom

Sleep eludes him as Jim stares at the ceiling
contemplating his fate

DISSOLVE TO

INT JIM’S BEDROOM - MORNING

The neighbor’s dog is barking Jim’s eyes snap open
He sits up with purpose

INT BATHROOM - MORNING

It’s a disaster area Jim enters and paints another
yellow layer He pees indiscriminately all over the
floor the toilet the wallswhatever He exits
without flushing

INT KITCHEN - MORNING

Jim strolls in wearing sweats and a wife beater He
grabs a stick of butter from the fridge Takes a box

of Strawberry Nestle’s® Quick from the cabinet

He jams the butter in the Quick and takes a bite
And that shit is good

While he eats his strawberry butter Jim collects
various wash rags from his kitchen

INT LIVING ROOM - MORNING

Jim is now wearing a T-shirt over the wife beater
and he’s holding a pile of other shirts and pants

He puts them on layer after layer

Then he starts wrapping his hands with the rags

EXT THE GAY NEIGHBOR’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

Jim bangs on the door wrapped in cotton armor The
Gay Neighbor answers

THE GAY NEIGHBOR

JIM
Where is he In the back

THE GAY NEIGHBOR
Who

Jim pushes past him

INT THE GAY NEIGHBOR’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
Jim freezes when he sees

AN ENTIRE WALL COVERED FLOOR TO CEILING WITH FRAMED
PHOTOS OF THE GAY NEIGHBORS DOG

FUCKING

Dozens of pictures of Hoag mounting other dogs
Hundreds of them really Poodles and Schnauzers
Shih-Tzus and Beagles all getting pounded from
behind

Tiny Dachshunds and Chihuahuas are barely visible
beneath Hoag’s massive chest The Shepherds and
Labradors look sad The Dobermans look frightened
There are many emotions because there are so many
pictures of so many dogs getting fucked

And the centerpiece of the collection is photo of the
Gay Neighbor giving a big thumbs up as Hoagie
piledrives a defeated Great Dane

THE GAY NEIGHBOR
(self-conscious )
Please don’t think I’m weird It’s
a long story
Jim stares at him
Long silence
THE GAY NEIGHBOR
I’m out of my mindyou know that
right

Jim shakes it off and marches past him

EXT THE GAY NEIGHBORS BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS

160 pounds of four-legged cocksucking Bull Mastiff
yanks against his spiked chain crazed frothing
This is a very serious dog Jim takes a deep breath

JIM
(without looking back)
Let him off

The Gay Neighbor moves from behind Jim and
approaches his dog He seems a bit frightened by his
own beast

THE GAY NEIGHBOR
Jim I can’t let him off Look at
him

JIM
This has to happen

THE GAY NEIGHBOR
Do you understand you’re on his
property Hoagie is a full bred
Bull Mastiff he’1l kill you man

The dog snarls raging against his restraints

JIM
So be it Let him off

The Gay Neighbor reaches for Hoag’s collar Looks at
Jim one last time

THE GAY NEIGHBOR
Are you sure Jim

Jim nods The Gay Neighbor releases Hoag Hoag
charges at Jim leaps

Jim throws up his arms just in time to protect his
throat but the savage animal knocks him to the
ground Hoag sets upon Jim with a ferocity that is
primal

Jim can do little more than offer his limbs to the
whirlwind of fangs

JIM
OH GOD

The dog locks onto Jim’s calf Hoag shakes
violently tearing off strips of bloody flesh Well
not flesh exactly it’s just cloth soaked with Jim’s
blood

Jim flails for a large grilling fork sitting next to
a barbecue grill

THE GAY NEIGHBOR
(subtitled speaks in Japanese)
Hoag hes going for the fork

The dog advances to the back of Jim’s neck and locks
on This could be the death of Jim

JIM
OH GOD

But Jim has the fork With all his might he shoves
the fork into Hoag’s back Hoag YELPS Jim tries to
scramble to his feet but falls due to the severe
wound on his calf Blood pours out of his pant cuff
He’1l die soon

THE GAY NEIGHBOR
Hoag he’s lost tremendous blood
You must sweep the legNOW

Despite a fork protruding from Hoag’s back the
animal is in top form Again it gets airborne

ON JIM - SLOW MOTION

Hoag flies through the air with a clear line to Jim’s
throat But at the last second--BAMN Jim clocks
him with a round house punch to the head

Jim screams certain that he’s broken his hand

But Hoag is also hurt And more importantly he’s
cautious

The two circle each other Both bloody

Jim looks for a way out The back gate is fifteen
feet away The Gay Neighbor shakes his head

THE GAY NEIGHBOR
You’1l never make it Jim What
youve begun cannot be undone
quoting “Wanted” )
We get our orders from a loom Of
FATE

Hoag is regaining his aggression snarling and
lunging Jim scrambles to find anything that will
help him not die

Lighter fluid A sustained squirt burns Hoag’s eyes
Jim looks around for matches cuz this fight is that
fucked up He reaches for the matches but

The Gay Neighbor is there first The dog looks at
his master

THE GAY NEIGHBOR
No mercy No mercy

Hoag charges The moment of truth is upon Jim and he
answers the callJim charges

JIM HOAGIE (THE DOG)
AAHHHH AAHHHH

Hoag gets ahold of Jim’s thigh but Jim has a firm
grip on that fork He shoves it in a bit deeper
Hoag pulls back just long enough for Jim to

Thrust his fist down into Hoag’s throat making it
impossible for him to bite down

Jims eyes are watering from the pain

little paw with his knee and drops his shoulder into
the dog’s leg joint

“CRACK”

HOAGIE (THE DOG)

David Hoag drops to his side His lower leg juts
outward at a sickening angle

Jim stumbles back while the dog writhes forever

reaches to calm Jim who is still flush with
adrenaline He takes Jim’s hand and raises it high

Simmers

Despite the absurdity and horror Jim’s just been
through he smiles Looks over at Hoag who has
crawled under the porch whimpering in the shadows

An eruption of raucous APPLAUSE Jim looks up to
see

THE NEIGHBORS from every house gathered around the
fence clapping wildly

I’ve looked death in the face and
stabbed it With a fork

Jill backs away from him

JILL
You’re starting to freak me out
here

JIM

Don’t be scared Jill What you’re
seeing is not an emotional break

things You’ve helped me see that

He takes her hands

JIM
Of course Jill I thought the job

The words hang heavy in the air Jill looks at Jim
incredulously

JILL

to me

JIM

Jill tries to contain the hurt she feels as she caps
the vodka trashes the rags

JIM
Is my new found magnitude
overwhelming you

JILL

Jill leaves before the tears can overtake her

This shit is relevant Jim

JIM

lint buried in pennies and nickels but there it
is

JIM
Viagra®

LARRY
One pill to rule them all
(before Jim can react)
Sorry

He pulls out a Martial Arts magazine “Ten Ways to

LARRY
Oh come on You’re living the
American dream man

ROB
On the outside Just like you guys
think those baby harp seals are so
warm and cute But you don’t know
You do not fucking know

WE ZOOM INTO ROB’S MIND

A COMPUTER ANIMATED world of snow The Canadian
arctic Just like in those classic Coke®
commercials we see a MOMMA POLAR BEAR and her BABY
BEAR playing with a ball

LIVE ACTION ROB is a short distance away watching
from astride his snowmobile

ROB
Awww

Baby Bear paws at the ball accidentally knocking it
into a hole in the ice Baby Bear tries to reach the
floating ball but has no luck Momma Bear just
smiles”“Isn’t he precious”

Just then a BABY HARP SEAL pops up in the water
Locks eyes with Baby Bear They smile not as lovers
but as friends The tableaux is so cute it hurts

The fluffy white baby harp seal nudges the ball so
that his new friend can retrieve it The Baby Bear
leans over the hole and

Without warning the Baby Harp Seal latches onto the
Baby Bear’s throat Blood gushes from the “bahhing”
Baby Bear’s mangled throat as

FIVE MORE BABY HARP SEALS erupt from beneath the
water and pounce on the Baby Bear

ROB
OH FUCK

Like piranha the Baby Harp Seals ravage the Baby
Bear taking him down consuming him even as he
fights for his life Soon there is nothing left but
bone and red snow

Momma Bear’s eyes are wide with shock Even MORE
BABY HARP SEALS emerge from the water and swarm

toward the Momma Bear She finally comes to her
senses and takes off running

They flop after her shockingly fast Within seconds
they’re on her devouring her hind quarters before
she even realizes it Momma Bear roars in agony as
the reality of her pain reaches her brain

Rob winces as the bloodthirsty Seals finish her off
leaving nothing but a nasty swath of guts and bones

Time to leave Rob tries to fire up his snowmobile
but it won’t turn over

THE BABY HARP SEALS HEAR HIM

They flop towards him a seething mass of crimson fur
and teeth Rob yanks the starter cord furiously

They’re closing in He’s not gonna make it

JIM (VO)
What’s the fucking lead time
Larry

BACK IN THE BAR

Jim is holding Larry by the collar while Rob trembles
silently

LARRY
(to Jim)
I don’t know an hourmaybe two

JIM
Fuck it

Jim slams back the pill with a shot of whiskey

Just then Jill enters Sees Jim and deliberately
avoids him as she makes her way to the far end of the
bar

Jim stares at her but she refuses to meet his gaze

JIM
I’m outta here

Jim storms his way to the exit
We stay with Rob and Larry Rob continues to

tremble traumatized by his memory Larry moves in
wraps his arms around Rob in a comforting embrace

LARRY
(softly)
I didn’t know

EXT OLIVIA’S CONDO - NIGHT

An upscale condo in one of the Cod’s many gated
communities We HEAR the legendary sound of Jim’s
stuck car horn approaching

Jims busted Beamer pulls up Jim kills the engine -
which has no effect on the horn - and climbs out
dressed in his finest

He walks the walk as he walks to the door and knocks
with unbridled confidence Seconds later the door
swings wide to reveal Olivia dressed to the nines

JIM
You look fucking awesome
(motions a circle)
Spin

Just a slight hesitation before she obliges No
panty lines are visible Jim nods satisfied

JIM
Let’s go

Jim offers his arm and leads her toward his bleating
vehicle

OLIVIA
Is thatis this your car

JIM
(confident ignoring the horn)
Yep It’s the all-new 2009 BMW M3
With a snarling V8 engine and
unparalleled driving dynamics this
sweet baby redefines the ultimate
driving experience

Jim opens the passenger side door for her

OLIVIA
But what’s up with the --

JIM
Get in

INT JIM’S BEAMER - DRIVING - NIGHT

The horn is relentless and we won’t stop writing about
it While Jim drives he moves his mouth in some weird
pattern but not making a sound Olivia watches him
quizzically

OLIVIA
(yells over the horn)
What’s that you’re doing Jim

Jim can’t hear her over the drone of the horn

OLIVIA

(Louder )
JIM What is that you’re doing
with your mouth

Jim turns to her smiles and nods his head

OLIVIA
(at the top of her lungs)
Your mouth What are you doing
with your MOUTH

JIM
Oh It’s Japanese It’s the
Japanese alphabet

It’s hard to tell if Olivia is impressed or
skeptical

OLIVIA
You speak Japanese

JIM
Only with my tongue

Jim flashes a devious smile Olivia just seems
confused

INT RESTAURANT BY THE BAY - NIGHT

Jim and Olivia are halfway through a bottle of wine
picking at their expensive meals in silence Jim
can’t help but eye her hungrily Like a pig eyes an
apple Or a junkie eyes an uncollapsed vein

JIM
How’s your lobster
OLIVIA
It’s unbelievable Firm yet

succulent

JIM’S INNER VOICE (VO)
Just like those tits

JIM
And what about these potatoes huh

OLIVIA
Mmmmm They’re insane It’s like
the truffles not only provide a
satisfyingly pungent note but
somehow they make them seem almost
impossibly creamy

JIMS INNER VOICE (VO)
Just like the peppery twang of your
quivering snitchie

JIM
And the wine

Olivia swirls the wine in her glass sniffs it and
takes a healthy sip

OLIVIA
It’s got a great intensity and
balance And a rounded almost
almondy flavor that really sets my
tongue atwitter

Jim closes his eyes

JIMS NO LONGER INNER VOICE
(outloud loudly)
Just like the chewy chocolate
center of your perfectly formed
ass

Heads turn in the restaurant but Olivia doesn’t bat

an eyelash And Jim doesn’t seem the least bit
embarrassed He looks her straight in the eye

JIM
Permission to speak freely
OLIVIA
Granted
JIM

I want to fuck you Olivia I want
to fuck you more than anything I’ve
wanted to do in the last two weeks

OLIVIA
Of course you do Everybody does

JIM
But I’m not everybody Olivia
Unlike the others I am a unique
snowflake created for just one
purposeto fuck you stupid

Olivia rolls her eyes - she’s heard this before

JIM
I AM worthy Olivia And I’m more
than capable In fact I’ve been
training

OLIVIA
(intrigued)
Training

JIM

For what seems like my entire
lifetime Everything before
fucking you is prologue Every
last thing I’ve ever done has been
meaningless next to putting myself
inside you and moving in and out in
a rhythmic manner

Jim speaks with an earnestness that is somehow
charming

JIM
You are my Rushmore Olivia You
are my Everest
An impossibly long beat

OLIVIA
Sure What the fuck

Jim beams with delight But then a thought hits him
that brings him down

JIM
One question

(beat)
Did you bring it

Olivia smiles Opens her purse and withdraws a
skimpy red bikini Jim’s eyes go wide

THUMMM-WACKKKK

Jim’s sudden onset boner slams against the underside
of the table sending the silverware dancing Olivia
smiles impressed

JIM
(to a passing busboy)
Check please Right Goddamn now

As Jim stands his Viagra®-enforced cock catches the
underside of the table and lifts it up

OLIVIA
Wow That’s gusto

Jim eases back - WHUMP - and the table drops But
the tablecloth is caught on Jim’s zipper Jim
smiles

JIM
Watch this

He puts his hands on his hips and swivels sharply
like a golfer In one fluid motion he yanks the
table cloth like a magicianjust far enough to send
dishes crashing to the floor

Every head in the restaurant turns A WAITER rushes
over

WAITER
What have you done

Jim stuffs a wad of cash into the Waiter’s shirt
pocket Points to Olivia

JIM
My name is Jim Simmers and Ima
winner

And then he yanks the rest of the tablecloth off
Pulls out another wad and tosses it in the Waiter’s
face

JIM
Fuck yeah I did

Olivia is so caught up in the moment that she smashes
her wine glass against the wall and follows Jim out

INT SHERATON HOTEL - NIGHT

A nice enough room Jim and Olivia enter She’s all
over him He stops her

JIM
Hold on I can’t afford for this
to suck

He grabs a bouquet of roses and thrusts them in
Olivia’s face

JIM
These are for you

Before she can sniff them he snatches them away and
starts tearing off the petals

Olivia doesn’t give a damn She goes into the
bathroom

Jim tosses the petals on the floor forming a path to
the bed

Then Jim boldly strips buck naked and stands on the
bed with his hands on his hips

Jims jaw drops when Olivia steps out of the bathroom
wearing her red bikini

HER BODY IS SICK She smirks confidently Does a
spin so he can see that ass in it’s natural
habitata thong

JIM
Oh my God

OLIVIA
You ain’t seen nothing yet

The top comes off His jaw drops further You know
those tits from Playboy in the 1970s The ones that
defied gravity without the aid of silicone Yeah
they’re like that

Yet it’s nothing It’s fucking nothing Because
when Olivia slides her thong down

Jim’s eyes fill with wonder as

-WARM AMBER LIGHT beams from between her legs
bathing the room in it’s supernatural glow

Jim stares like a child It’s like when John
Travolta opened that briefcase in Pulp Fiction

Except this is pussy
This is magical pussy

OLIVIA

That’s right

CLOSE ON JIM’S FACE overjoyed as she moves towards
him He’s gonna get it It’s actually gonna happen

CUT TO

INT HOTEL ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

CLOSE ON JIM’S FACE a mask of sheer and utter
disappointment as it rocks back and forth

Olivia rides him out of her mind with pleasure

OLIVIA
Oh fuck my God Oh Jesus of
goddamn Gods

Jim couldn’t care less If he cares about anything
it’s that this moment is the most disappointing
moment in his disappointing life

OLIVIA
Jim Jim You are the God of
fuckery My God Oh my fuck-God

Jim holds his face shakes his headthis is SUCH a
letdown Such a soul-crushing letdown

EXT HOTEL ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Jim staggers out half-dressed looking like a rape
victim

OLIVIA (0OS)
and don’t forget to bring some
water back too I’m dehydrated
(then )
And get yourself an energy drink
You’re gonna need it

Jim wanders down the hall in a haze trying to
process why his life has no meaning

EXT JIM’S BMW - CONTINUOUS

Jim leans against the door bummed And he still has
that boner It points him to

The Black Hobo (from page 20) ranting to a flock of
seagulls

BLACK HOBO
(to the seagulls)
--you have spent too many years at
sea searching for fish when
there’s biscuits right here on the
Titanic

Jim walks up

BLACK HOBO

You wirr destloy yourse’ves and the
shaorin temper if you don’t stop

Welcome Dolemite how has it been

JIM

BLACK HOBO

And it sucked

BLACK HOBO

Oxymoron
BLACK HOBO
Shove it
JIM

But it’s true It’s fucking true

BLACK HOBO
Don’t be like these birds
Jimberly

BLACK HOBO (CONTD)
Don’t be out at sea when there’s
biscuits at home On the Titanic

Jims mind races trying to decipher the bum’s words
He can’t crack the code

JIM
Just tell me what you mean

The Bum just babbles Jim throws a trash can at his
seagulls sending them flying He turns and marches
for the Beamer

INT JIM’S BMW - NIGHT

Jim speeds through the night lost and alone

EXT MID CAPE HIGHWAY - STOPLIGHT - NIGHT

Both lanes have cars stopped at the light The horn
of death bears down on them

Jims screaming Beamer swerves around the stopped
cars and blows through the intersection
EXT ROB’S HOUSE - LATER

Jim slaps the car into park causing it to lurch He
gets out Doesn’t bother to close the door

JIM

Jim pounds on Rob’s door desperate Rebecca
answers smiles sweetlythen socks Jim in the head

JIM
Hey--what the hell
REBECCA
(flustered)
He’s gone you you youhole
JIM

REBECCA
No the point is he’s gone because
of you
JIM

Yeah but where is he I need to
talk to him

REBECCA
Listen to me you pig Stop
cunting on yourself and listen We
had it all--our family ass worked
until you had to shit in your hand
and wipe it in our marriage’s face

Jims face twists trying to deconstruct her awkward
use of profanity

JIM
Jesus Rebecca Can you just tell
me where he is

REBECCA
Rob never damn cared about all the
bullshit you and Larry craved Now
he’s fuck-ass crazy in the streets
looking for God only knows what

JIM
If you don’t know where he is just
say it

She socks him again The neighbors’ lights come on

REBECCA
He never stayed out all night Not
in forty-two years of marriage

JIM
What the hell are you talking
about

From inside Rob’s house we hear a mighty groan

JUNIOR (0S)
DAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADDDY

Rob looks towards the door Hears chains rattling

REBECCA
You hear that He misses his
father Cocking up a marriage is
fuck enough but raping a father
away from his man-child is runny
shit on a bag of fuck

The words impact Jim Deeply They make him say

JIM
So you don’t know where he is

REBECCA
Maybe you should ask my son

She pulls out an IRON KEY

JIM
You wouldn’t

Rebecca sprints inside the house Jim sprints for
his car Fighting a dog is one thing fighting
Junior issuicide

INT EXT JIM’S BMW - CONTINUOUS

He fumbles with the keys Even over the horn he
hears

Jim turns the ignition Slams it into reverse Pure
terror floods his face when

JUNIOR CHARGES OUT OF THE HOUSE

He’s huge He’s naked And he’s got MMA gloves on
grasping a MONKEY WRENCH in each hand

Jim hits the gas

JIM
FUCK

But he was in reverse Slams into a car Now he’s
done for because

JUNIOR IS COMING
The mighty beast lowers his shoulder barreling down
on Jim’s beamer BUH-WHAM He rams the drivers
side like a T-Rex denting the door Glass shatters
JUNIOR
(bellowing)
DAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADDY
JIM SLAMS IT INTO DRIVE --

He pulls away Junior gives chase Terminator 2
style

JIM
Holy Jesus

JUNIOR HURLS ONE OF WRENCHES --

Jim SEES IT rocketing towards him in the rearview--
leans just as the wrench shatters the rear window
and - THWUNK - lodges into the stereo

More gas Junior slowly recedes in the rearview

INT THE BEACHCOMBER BAR - NIGHT

Only the dregs are here Maureen sits waiting
watching the front door It opens

The sound of Jim’s car horn floods in behind him as
he enters He sees Maureen approaches like he’s got
something to say

JIM
Where’s Larry I need to talk to
him
MAUREEN

I’m waiting for him now If you
want to sit be my guest

JIM
That’s probably a bad idea

He sniffsno odorso he takes a seat

JIM
You know I was gonna decline cause
I thought the stench would be too
stomach churning but I must say
you’re surprisingly fresh

She smiles with pride

MAUREEN
Yeah It’s these charcoal-lined
panties I bought As a surprise
for Larry

Now Jim and Maureen both stare at the door Every
time it opens the car horn spills in annoying the
patrons

They sit in silence for a long awkward moment

MAUREEN
He should’ve been here four hours
ago I don’t know what’s taking
him so long

JIM
Ah he’s probably caught in
traffic
A look of shock and anger contorts Maureen’s face

She can

Maureen

Maureen

JIM (CONTD)
That redhead lives in Chatham and
the mid-cape was jammed coming from
that direction

MAUREEN

MAUREEN

What redhead

JIM
I don’t know one of his girls I
forget her name

JIM

JIM
I mean you can’t be surprised that
he bangs other women right Shit
the guy steals from you

MAUREEN
I don’t
JIM
Come on What about the
clothespin
MAUREEN

It was a game Or at least I
thought it was

is devastated Close to tears
JIM

Hey look if it’s any consolation
he complains about you the least

stands up Rushes for the door just as

horn screams to announce Larry’s entrance

LARRY
(to Maureen)
Sorry I’m late I was just--

MAUREEN
You were fucking a redhead
She storms out Larry knows not the follow He

turns

locks onto Jim

LARRY
What the hell did you tell her

JIM
Thank God you’re here Larry I
fucked Olivia and it was great but
it really sucked and I--

LARRY
Dude what did you say to Maureen

JIM
Nothing She wondered where you
were so I told her--

LARRY
You told her I was banging the
redhead What’s wrong with you

Jim looks at him as if he’d just sprouted a second

head

JIM
What’s wrong with ME I’m baffled
man This baffles me I mean how
am I the bad guy

LARRY

(incredulous)
You told my girl that I was fucking
someone else

JIM

YOUR GIRL What the fuck You’re
a fucking gigolo man With all
the fucked up shit you do how is
it possible that she didn’t
understand this

LARRY
It doesn’t matter Jim You never -
never ever EVER - say that shit to
someone’s girl

JIM
I didn’t even know she was your
girl Larry

LARRY
Neither did I But no matter how
weird mine and Maureen’s shit is
you know that you shouldn’t have
made her feel bad right Right

Jim thinks Fuck Larry’s quite probably right

LARRY
Youve changed Jim
(dead serious)
I thought you were a blue belt
But you’re not You’re just a
selfish asshole

Larry executes a dramatic about-face and marches
defiantly out the door And of course the ever-
present screech of Jim’s car horn is there to greet
him

INT JIM’S LIVING ROOM - 258 AM

Jim sits in the dark lost and alone He’s reached
the end of his rope His past life is destroyed
there is no future there is just purgatory
Unless

He picks up the remote The television splashes the
darkness with shifting light Jim leans forward
surfing the channels with urgency

JIM
Come on

Channel after channel Jim searches for the man
formerly known as Tom Cruise

continues to search for salvation by television

He stops

He knows what he must do Jim pisses himself He
pisses himself hard and fast

Jim heads out bringing us back to where it all began
and

EXT BEACH PARKING LOT - SUNNY DAY

Clogged with doughy tourists bulging out of their
bathing suits A long line of cars waiting to park
snakes out onto the main road In the distance we
HEAR the persistent sound of a STUCK CAR HORN getting
louder

Jims Beamer barrels past the line of waiting cars
Steam billows from its severely dented grill

With no regard for anyone the Beamer swerves in
front of an old lady and skids to a stop across the
last two handicap spaces

Jim calmly exits the vehicle and begins to peel off
his robe and pyjamas one piece at a time as he
marches towards a trash can

He’s down to his underwear as he snatches a newspaper
out of the PARKING ATTENDANTS hand and buck naked by
the time he squats into the trash can to take a shit

It’s a scene man He’s folded in half ass
submerged in the trash can knees dangling over the
side Jim flips to the sports page seemingly
unaware of the slack-jawed GAWKERS crowded around

The STUCK CAR HORN in the background is accented by a
short GRUNT of relief as Jim finishes

He struggles to get out of the can then pushes past
the horrified crowd bee-lining for the ocean Naked
as a jaybird he strides purposefully into the cold
waters of the Atlantic

The wailing CAR HORN rises in CRESCENDO as we

Thenhe squints Jim turns around and

Tom Cruise is in his lavish helicopter teaching his

personal chef BASKERVILLE how to make hot dogs to
perfection Always perfection

BASKERVILLE
Mr Cruise I understand

TOM CRUISE
I’ve measured the water precisely
to allow the exposed skin of these
Oscar Meyer® granddaddy franks to
harden to perfection

Always perfection

Tom Cruise stares into Baskerville’s soul until
Baskerville averts his eyes

with his PILOT and CO-PILOT Points his fingers at

His pilot squints Points out to the ocean below

like it not one goddamn bit

(points in their faces to let them
know who the fuck he is)

Tom Cruise storms out ready for action

INT BELLY OF THE CHOPPER - CONTINUOUS

Tom Cruise grabs a rope ties it around his leg
ready to jump

Tom yanks open the bay door He jumps Backwards

EXT SKY - CONTINUOUS

Tom Cruise falls arms out Christlike Better still
Tom Cruise-like His eyes are closed for maximum
intensity

But gradually his perfect form is perverted by
factors like gravity and the heavy rotor wash that
causes the rope to entangle his body

EXT OCEAN - CONTINUOUS

About five feet above the surface Tom Cruise’s rope
yanks taut caught around his left arm and ankle

TOM CRUISE
AAAHHHH

Both primary joints shoulder and hip are violently
dislocated
INT BELLY OF THE CHOPPER - CONTINUOUS

agony

TOM CRUISE
No NO Danger cannot win Not
this time This time I make danger

He lowers the rope and Tom Cruise splashes face first
into the mighty Atlantic

EXT OCEAN - CONTINUOUS

Tom Cruise is drowning He’s tangled in rope with
half his body immobilized and he’s drowning

Jim is nearby Tom Cruise cringes in agony as he
valiantly swims towards him

INT BELLY OF THE CHOPPER - CONTINUOUS

Baskerville and the CO-PILOT scan the ocean below
searching for any sign of their heroic employer
Then they see it

Tom Cruise’s hand gives the thumbs-up from beneath
the very ocean that is killing him They hit the
button on an electric winch It’s winchy thing
turns

EXT OCEAN - CONTINUOUS

Tom Cruise uses his one good arm to clasp around
Jims throat in a choke hold As the rope pulls
tight

TOM CRUISE
AAAAAHHHH GOD

He dangles hips and shoulders being ripped further
from their sockets by the added weight of Jim who
if he’s not already dead is surely being strangled
to death

INT BELLY OF THE CHOPPER - MOMENTS LATER

Although severely damaged Tom Cruise fights to save
Jim’s life beating on his chest

TOM CRUISE
Don’t you die on me man Youve
never backed away from a fight in
your life you bitch Fight

(smacks Jim)
Fight

(smacks Baskerville)

FIGHT

Jim coughs

BASKERVILLE
He’s alive

Tom Cruise staggers over to a seat collapses into
it exhausted Baskerville is horrified when he
notices

BASKERVILLE
Master Youryour leg

Tom Cruise’s left arm and leg hang slack flopped at
weird angles

Tom Cruise hops up on his one good leg and slams his
hip back into socket with a sickening pop

He lets loose an intense groan accompanied by tears
and snot Now for the shoulder

The same thing Another groan More tears and snot

Tom falls to his knees then looks up at Jim with
damp eyes burning with full intensity

Jims face is calm He looks at the man who saved
him Everything leading up to this moment now makes
sense

JIM
I’ve finally seen the light I
finally understand what you were
talking about

JIM (CONTD)
I used to think that sometimes you
gotta say what the fuck--or
whatever that that was the right
thing to do But now I know Tom
Cruise I know that it was the
wrong movie

BASKERVILLE
(heartfelt)

I too lived my life out of place
Years ago I was all Days of
Thunder until I nearly killed a
man And when I saw Cocktail I
became even more confused But
then when I realized that The
Outsiders and Far and Away were--

TOM CRUISE
ENOUGH This man has finally
gotten out of his own way and
ou’re confusing him with your
imprecise bullshit BEGONE

He points to the cockpit Baskerville skulks off
Tom Cruise looks at Jim Intensely

TOM CRUISE
Look if there’s one thing I’ve
learned having climbed a thousand
mountains it’s that
(one last beam of intensity)
You’ve gotta learn to live with
what you are my friend

Jim contemplates this It makes hella-sense to him

JIM
Fuck yeah I do

They shake hands Tom Cruise yanks him into a manly
embrace and we FREEZE FRAME triumphantly

EXT BEACH PARKING LOT - AFTERNOON

Upon golden sun we set hither Jim walks toward us
wearing Baskerville’s pristine white chef’s uniform

past the still blaring BMW

Here he goes (again) on his own Going down the only
road he’s ever known

EXT JIM’S APARTMENT - DUSK

Jim enters the house Beat He exits and heads
around back to his dusty SPORTY KIA SPECTRUM (WITH

fires it up

EXT ROB’S GARAGE - EVENING
Rob is packing up his shit forlorn Jim approaches
Notices Rob’s array of SEAL HOOKS lined against the

wall Each more horrendous in design than the next

Rob begins packing his hooks into a stylish attache’
case one at a time

JIM
What are you doing Rob

ROB
What does it look like I’m doing
I’m packing my shit

Jim is calmer than Lake Placid on a placid day

JIM
Do you think what you’re doing is
smart

ROB

I don’t know if it’s smart but I
know Ill be gone And that’s a
start

JIM
Why are you doing this

Rob stops packing Sets down a disturbingly
bloodstained gaff

ROB
I’m doing it because of you

Jim remains silent

ROB (CONTD)
I saw the light Jim I mean
there’s a whole world out there
that doesn’t involve the shit I
have to deal with here

He waits for Jim to respond but Jim remains silent

ROB
Sure I’ll miss her And the boy
But you know what There’s more to
life than this domesticated
bullshit right Right

Jim slowly shakes his head ‘no’ Rob is
crestfallen

ROB
But how can you say that Jim
After all you’ve been through and
all of the glorious things you’ve
achieved for yourself in these last
two weeks how can you honestly say
that

JIM
Because it’s the truth Don’t make
the mistakes that I made Rob
Don’t give up what you’ve got for
what will never be (deep)

Jim grabs Rob by the shoulders as a father would
and stares into his soul with Cruise-like intensity

JIM
A wise man once spoke to me Rob
And he told me something really
important something I’d like to
share with you

ROB
I’m listening

Jim takes a deep cleansing breath and closes his eyes
as he recalls the words that changed his life

JIM
He said “Don’t be like these
birds Jimberly Don’t be out at
sea when there’s biscuits at home
On the Titanic” (fucking deep)

Jim opens his eyes

JIM
And you know what He was right
I heard him but I was just too
proud to listen

Holy fucking shit The simple truth of the Black
Bum’s words and Jim’s understanding of them hits Rob
like a ton of bricks

ROB
(rocked to the core)
My God you’re right You’re
soright Jim What am I doing
(realizing)
Oh God what have I done

Just then Rebecca appears in the doorway love and
forgiveness filling her eyes

veneer of domestic bliss has been restored

As Schooley holds out the baby and McCorkle moves in
our attention shifts to the door

The theme from AN OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN SWELLS as
Jim still wearing Baskerville’s gleaming white
chef’s uniform enters the building and strides
across the office with purpose

All heads turn as he closes in on Jill’s cubicle

INT JILL’S CUBICLE - CONTINUOUS

Jill stands her back to the entrance feeding
documents into a paper shredder Jim slides up from
behind her and kisses her on the neck

Jill turns reacts with pleasant surprise as she
removes the earplugs from her ears Jim pulls her
close and kisses her with a heretofore unseen gusto

They separate staring lovingly into each other’s
eyes The music RISES IN CRESCENDO and

WA-PAPP

She wallops Jim square in the nose sending him
tumbling backward on his ass Blood cascades from
his busted snout saturating his white uniform

expect to get weak in the knees
just because you come waltzing in
here in a sexy uniform

Jim struggles to get his feet

She kicks him back down on his ass then wipes her
bloody shoe on his pants

magical hoo-hoo but I have self-
respect I have respect Jim For
