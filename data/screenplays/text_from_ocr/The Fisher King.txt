disappears behind the paper

ANNE the owner of the store enters abruptly -- closing
the office door behind her a cigarette dangling for her
mouth Her desk is organized litter -- her walls are
filled with porno tapes She searches for one as she
talks

ANNE

A bit about Anne as she searches for a video Anne is in
her mid-to-late thirties and she is all woman She
has a raw earthy unmistakable sensuality Her red
lipstick matches her red nail polish like a hat and glove
set Inlaid on each nail is a rhinestone design of a
little star Her angora sweaters are tight and clinging
giving her breasts a decided lift and perkiness Her
backless pumps slap the ground A half-smoked cigarette
hangs out of her mouth with great expertise -- a skill
Anne obviously picked up in a high school bathroom Her
voice is thick with a delicious Brooklyn twang

She is pure streetwise in attitude philosophy and emotions
She turns and speaks to the man behind the tabloid

ANNE
(continuing)
Hey Mr Happiness

The man lowers the newspaper it is Jack Lucas no
longer the aggressive radio star but more -- a man who
looks like he hasnt slept in months An intolerant
paranoid self-pitying misanthrope The outrageous
articles fascinate him Anne removes the paper and
scotch bottle

ANNE
(continuing)
Are we going to work today or what

Jack stares back Anne waits for an answer Jack looks
through the open office door and sees the store is packed

gasoline Leather also carries a bat Jack is drunk but
he is immediately aware of the danger when he spots the
gasoline cans

LEATHER

What are you doing here

Jack shakes his head and before he knows it Leather
shoves the bat into his gut sinking Jack to his knees
Windbreaker places the gasoline cans on the bench and
begins to unscrew them

LEATHER

You shouldnt hang around this

FIGURE MOVING OUT FROM THE DARKNESS

FIGURE
All hope abandon ye who enter here

Startled THE YOUTHS TURN to the shadows

LEATHER
What the-

AN ARROW with a rubber suction tip comes flying out of the
dark and connects to WINDBREAKERs groin

WINDBREAKER
AHHH

A FIGURE stands backlit - mysterious and powerful noble and
fearless JACK LEATHER and WINDBREAKER instinctually bond
together in the face of this fourth unknown entity

The figure turns out to be a BUM Grimy face tattered layers

of clothing beneath a long over coat a pork pie hat with a

twig sticking out of it like a plume in a helmet of yore

Over his shoulder a homemade bow and arrow set

Although clearly downtrodden behind his beaten appearance there
radiates a calm intelligence and strength There is something
distinctly attractive and confident about him We learn later

his name is PARRY a combination of Don Quixote and Harpo Marx
PARRY stands before them absolutely delighted with himself -
hand on hip - beaming with pride

PARRY
Unhand that degenerate - you adolescent ass
of a one balled donkey

LEATHER
Its just a bumYou know theres
enough in here for the two of you

PARRY
(a la Glinda)
Ha ha ha ha rubbishnow begonebefore
somebody drops a house on you

LEATHER walks right up to PARRY

LEATHER
You a fag too

PARRY

Curst wolf Thy fury inward on thyself
Pray and consume thee

LEATHER
Fuck you

PARRY notices a pimple on LEATHERS cheek

PARRY
Oooothat looks like it hurts
HE presses the zit

LEATHER
OWWWWhat are you nuts

PARRY
BINGO Tell the man what hes won

WINDBREAKER grabs PARRY pinning his arms behind him
WINDBREAKER laughs PARRY just turns his head and stares into
his eyes causing WINDBREAKER to feel weird

PARRY
I advise you to let us go

LEATHER
You advise us

PARRY
Youre out numbered son

PARRY glances over LEATHERs shoulder LEATHER TURNS to see

A BUM pushing a shopping cart comes out of the darkness HE

is mumbling to himself incoherently Another BUM appears from
the dark unnerving WINDBREAKER PARRY looks to a third

BUM stepping out of the dark menacingly

Taken by themselves the BUMS would look harmless and pathetic
But in the context of their uncharacteristic organization -
THEY appear frightening

LEATHER and WINDBREAKER automatically whip out switchblades
and take a rumble stance - as if protecting their

catch Jack Jack sort of sides with them if for no other
reason than - hes known them longer

LEATHER tries to remain confident HE laughs

LEATHER
Come on Go for it
What the hell are they gonna do
They cant do nothin

PARRY
Nothing They can do nothing
Gentlemen

PARRY takes a few steps back and raises his hand

JACK stands close to LEATHER and WINDBREAKER who prepare
themselves for attack

PARRY lowers his hand which acts as a signal for the BUMS
The BUMS reach into their coats and each pull out a FLASHLIGHT
which they shine at each other as THEY SING

THREE BUMS
I like New York in JuneHow about you
I like a Gershwin tuneHow about you

JACK LEATHER and WINDBREAKER are at a loss The BUMS arent
getting all the words but theyre definitely in sync

PARRY lowers his hand proudly The BUMS keep singing and turn
their flashlights upon JACK LEATHER and WINDBREAKER - blinding
them to PARRY

WINDBREAKER
Shit

LEATHER brandishes his knife towards the dark spot where he
thinks PARRY stands But PARRY takes a flying step back
As he speaks the Bums stop singing and hum the song

PARRY
SonThere comes a time in
every mans lifeand you will
learn this if and when you become men

From his hat PARRY pulls a long tube sock tied at the
end and filled with a softball at the bottom

PARRY
That there are only three things in
this world ya need

HE begins to swing the sock over his head - centrifugally
gaining force

PARRY
-Respect for all kinds of life
-the love of one other person who
you can trust and pork on a regular basis
and a nice navy blazerOh and one
more thingalways keep your eye
on the ball

PARRY releases the weapon
The sock flies out of the darkness and with amazing
accuracy - beans LEATHER on the forehead between his eyes HE

drops his knife to rub his head HE sinks out of camera

LEATHER
OwOwOW

WINDBREAKER grows worried as PARRY reaches in to the lining
of his coat pulls out another sock weapon and starts swinging

PARRY
However the ability to bean

a shithead can be a fabulous advantage

WINDBREAKER runs to the car and drives away
PARRY crosses to a speechless JACK

PARRY
(picking up LEATHERS knife)
Are you all right

LEATHER
(kneeling rubbing his head)
OWWMAN
JACK
(disoriented)

Please dont hurt me

PARRY
OH beings blind What ignorance besets you

PARRY kneels down pulls out some rope from his coat and proceeds
to tie up LEATHER who is disoriented and dazed PARRY hands
JACK LEATHERS knife Sickened by it JACK flings it in the water

LEATHER
You cant leave me tied up out here
alone you fucking faggot

PARRY
(PULLS DOWN LEATHERS PANTS EXPOSING HIS BUTT)
You wont be alone for long

PARRY pulls out a triangle and begins ringing it

JACK
I need a drink

PARRY
I know a great place
(Raising his hand HE calls to BUM 1)
UHWARREN

BUMS (0OC)

Theyre so proud

CUT TO

EXT A LOT BENEATH THE MANHATTAN BRIDGE - NIGHT

A violent explosion between warring factions of bums who
are defending territories and rights

CUT TO
Jack and Parry sit facing the three Bums from the previous
scene - A Black A middle-aged Irishman and an Ex-Hippy -

and the Pinnochio Doll The Foursome sit against the giant
base of the bridge discussing the issues of the day as they pass
a bottle OTHER BUM CLIQUES are scattered throughout the lot

BLACK
There aint no justice in life Theres
just satisfaction And the death
penaltys just another violation of my
constitutional right to satisfaction Goddamn it

IRISHMAN
(a lit cigarette hangs from his mouth)
I hate that

HIPPIE
So you mean if somebody like killed
your mother you wouldnt want him dead

BLACK
Sure I would But I should get to kill him Goddamn it

IRISHMAN
(explaining further)
He gets to kill him Thats democracy see

A LULL takes over as they all consider this
JACK sitting the furthest apart from the group looks like hes
in the middle of a nightmare

JACK
(mumbles to himself)
This is it Im in hell Damned to
an eternity of idiotic conversation

PARRY
(leans in and smiles)
Great place huh
The Irishman lets out a bloodcurtling scream
PARRY

(responds)
AAAAHHHH

JACK jumps Irishman looks to PARRY and speaks in calm monotone

IRISHMAN
How are you tonight

PARRY
Fine John and you

IRISHMAN
Cant complain
The IRISHMAN absent mindedly flicks his cigarette ashes onto
JACKS SLEEVE which is soaked with gasoline The SLEEVE IGNITES
JACK panics - waving his is arm trying to get it out

PARRY is both amazed and impressed - seeing it as a sign

The bums talk casually as JACK tries to rip off his coat

BLACK
Crazy fuck

HIPPY
(to IRISHMAN)
So what do you think of the death penalty

IRISHMAN
Deaths definitely a penalty Aint
no fucking gift Lifes too goddamn short

With the fire out JACK tries to leave saying

JACK
I better be going

IRISHMAN
(thrusting the bottle at him)
Have a drinkdont be shy
(JACK sits quickly)

PARRY
I think they like you

This worries Jack PARRY retrieves him and brings him back
to the group

The IRISHMAN removes the bottle from his saliva soaked mouth and
hands it to JACK who is disgusted

JACK
Oh no thats all-

BLACK
DRINK GODDAMN IT

JACK grabs the bottle and drinks - holding back his nausea

PARRY
Would anyone like a fruit pie

THREE BUMS (0OC)
No thank youToo sweetto fatteningGoddamn it

JACK feels sick as the cheap liquor running through him
IRISHMAN begins reciting a Chaucer passage in old English
The BLACK stares off half listening PARRY turns to JACK
his face beaming he clasps his hands and says

PARRY
Et in arcadia ego

HIPPY
ManWhy did God invent mediocrity

This remark acts like a slap in the face to JACK The others
consider it in silence - not really knowing what it means

The cheap liquor begins to take its effect and from JACKS POV
WE FADE OUT OF THE SCENE ON THE NEXT LINES - AS HE CLOSE HIS EYES
AND SLIPS INTO A DRUNKEN SLUMBER

HIPPIE (0C)
You were phenominal tonight Parry
(affirmations from the other two)
SUPER-BUM man Fucking Marvel Comics
FADE-OUT
FADE-UP ON
INT PARRYS BASEMENT HIDEAWAY - MORNING
JACK is asleep on a mattress beside a boiler spewing steam
HE is slowly awakened by water dripping on his cheek - -

- the first dull pangs of a mean hangover making itself known

HE opens his eyes confused -- not knowing exactly what
happened

CUT TO
THE GIANT FACE OF PARRY

lying parallel beside him -- like a kid waiting for his
parents to wake up Xmas morning

PARRY
(loud and cheery)

How are you feeling

Jarred Jack nods suspiciously He notices the

surroundings --

JACK
Have I died

PARRY

(friendly)

Hahahahaaa Nononono Not yet
Hahahaha

JACK

(his head throbbing)
If youre going to murder me thats
fine just dont laugh

He tries to focus his eyes and looks around the room
there is an extremely organized living area -- a make-
shift kitchen with hot plate a nail in a wall with
clothes on hangers There is also a dumpster sitting
beneath a garbage chute -- The dumpster has planets and
stars painted on its side

Jack looks to the far wall and sees a handmade collage
mural pictures cut out and pasted in a haphazard
manner all medieval in origin grassy landscape with
castles knights and maidens on horses crests and
symbols of the Crusades and various renditions of the
Holy Grail One maiden stands out from the rest -- a
frail looking doe-like creature

On the adjacent wall however there are no pictures
Only frantic scribblings in red marker Out of the
scribblings we can see an evil looking face with a bear
amateurishly drawn a large red horse drawn as if it
hurt to get out the image the style is violent and
erratic

Jack looks to the other wall and finds Parrys arsenal
-- homemade weapons that also look medieval like
lances made from mop sticks nets made of knotted rope
slingshots and a shield made from a garbage can cover
with a rose painted on it Against each wall are piled
what seems to be hundreds of books Jack doesnt know
what to make of all this He is frightened

JACK
Where am I

PARRY
My abode My domicile My neck of
the woods Hungry Breakfast A

fruit pie perhaps

JACK
No thanks Listen --

PARRY
My name is Parry

JACK
(realizes hes barefoot)
Hi Where are my shoes
PARRY
Theyre --
(suddenly stands)
-- What
JACK
(jumps)
Where --

PARRY
(to the air)

What

JACK
What

PARRY
Sshhhh

Parry looks like hes listening to someone Then he
smiles broadly at Jack which makes Jack worry even more

PARRY
(continuing to the
air)
I knew it I knew it last night
(beat argues)
I did too Hes the one

He kneels beside Jack which makes Jack lean up against
the boiler

PARRY
(continuing)
Can you keep a secret

Jack shakes his head

PARRY
(continuing)
Do you know what the Little People
just told me

JACK
The Little People

PARRY
They said youre The One

JACK
Im the one what

PARRY
(stands abruptly)
Oh shut up

He picks up a can of wintergreen air freshener and starts

spraying with violent strokes to shut them up Jack
gets more nauseous from the smell Parry yells to the
air
PARRY
(continuing)

Ive got a right to say
something I mean youre tying my
hands here

(to Jack)
They say youre not ready to know

JACK
Im not
(to himself)
Now where are those shoes

Jack makes a move to stand when Parry stops spraying and
yells

PARRY
Hheeyy

Jack sits back down Parry whispers to the air

PARRY
(continuing)
» Youre frightening him

Parry kneels before him Jack presses against the
boiler

PARRY
(continuing)
-- Do you know who I am

JACK
Uhh Im drawing a blank

PARRY
Take a guess
(shouts to the air)
Let him guess Tech

He goes for the air freshener but Jacks reply stops him

JACK
Uh gee well you seem to be
some kind of vigilante

PARRY
No no I mean that sort of happens
along the way but no
(proudly)

Im on a very special quest

JACK
A quest

PARRY
But I need help and they sent you

JACK
(clarifying)
The Little

PARRY
They work for Him

JACK
Him
PARRY
(leans in to whisper)
God Im the janitor of God

Jacks face drops Parry gets comfortable and explains
casually

PARRY
(continuing)

They came to me about a year ago
I was sitting on the john having one
of the most satisfying bowel
movements -- you know the ones --
where you just see God And I saw
them just floating around
hundreds of these cute little fat
people And they spoke They said
I was chosen to help them get back
something very important they lost
But my part might be very dangerous
I said Whoah slow down ya
start hearing voices from floating
little fat people that tell you
youre on a mission for God and you

wind up in a mini-series Then they
said Look in Architecture Today Feb
88 page 33

Parry quickly crosses to a pile of magazines grabs one
and dives back to Jack who keeps scanning for his shoes
Parry leafs through the magazine and opens to page 33

PARRY
(continuing)
And there it was plain as day

He shows Jack a feature about Langdon Carmichael a
Malcolm Forbes type real estate baron The five page
pictorial depicts his ten million dollar restoration of
an old NY Armory into a palatial city home Caption
reads REAL ESTATE BILLIONAIRE LANGDON CARMICHAELS
TOWER OF POWER

JACK
Langdon Carmichael

Carmichael himself -- a dashing bachelor around fifty-
five -- is shown standing in his private library beside a
glass commode Parry points to inside the commode where
a golden chalice is displayed

PARRY
Its the Grail The Holy Grail

He indicates the pictures on the collage Jacks losing
it

JACK
The Holy Grail Some billionaire has
the Holy Grail sitting in a commode
on Madison Avenue

PARRY
I know You cant imagine how
surprised I was Who would think you
could find anything divine on the
Upper East Side

JACK
(annoyed now)
Listen I dont mean to be flippant
or to enrage you or anything but
youre an imbecile And Im not The
One Im not any One

Parry tries to speak but

JACK
(continuing)
I think youre a very nice very
nice psychotic man I really
appreciate what you did for me It
was a very brave and noble thing

PARRY
Oh please youre embarrassing me
JACK
(rising)

I wish you all the luck in the world
When you get the Grail Im sure Ill
be seeing lots of you on various talk
shows

PARRY
(upset)
But I cant get it Hes

He runs to the wall with the scribblings in red and
indicates the evil face with the beard He picks up a
red marker and begins scribbling furiously -- adding to
the face and the horse

PARRY

(continuing)
Hes out there I dont know if
Hes always out there see and

He drops the marker and smiles to Jack
PARRY

(continuing)
See you dont know him Thats why
youre the one You can get it
JACK
Listen forget the shoes Ill just
take a cab Uh
PARRY
Parry
JACK
Parry Im Jack
PARRY
I know

Parry rushes to a corner and gets Jacks shows and
Pinnochio doll then rushes to Jack and hands them over

JACK
Thanks You can keep the doll

PARRY
Thanks a mill --
(like a corporate exec)
And Ill give you a buzz as soon as I
hear from the people upstairs and
well get this thing off the

ground Thanks for stopping by
Jack Give my love to the wife and
kids

Parry grabs Jacks hand and shakes it

JACK
Im not married

PARRY
Funny -- you look married

Horrified Jack makes a hasty exit

CUT TO
INT BROWNSTONE HALLWAY - MINUTES LATER
Jack steps out of what appears to be the entrance to the
basement He walks down the hallway toward the front
exit when suddenly an apartment door swings open FRANK
a burly black superintendent with a hearing aid steps

out

FRANK

FRANK

Jacks hangover sets off another explosion

JACK

bottom half of Franks wheelchair bound WIFE one leg is

to end

FRANK

CUT TO
INT VIDEO POP OFFICE - DAY

Anne sits at her desk surrounded by her shelves of porno
tapes Jack sits before her looking like death warmed over
Franks voice reverbs in his head as he half listens to Anne

ANNE
But when you care about somebody
ya need more than an open relationship
Ya need a phone call

Her intercom RINGS Annes tone immediately changes

ANNE
(continuing)

EMPLOYEE (VO)
A guy wants to check out the
pornos

ANNE
So send him back

intercom and returns
to Jack softly)
Ya need to pick up the phone and
tell me that youre not dead that

A meek fiftyish BUSINESSMAN has entered and begins to
browse through the porno videos discreetly

JACK
Im sorry
ANNE

She and the Businessman exchange glances Jack is about
to respond when Anne continues

ANNE
(continuing)
I cant tell you how distraught I
was All night long What the hell

JACK
I was attacked

ANNE

JACK
Two kids tried to set me on fire

ANNE
Oh my God What did they do My
God
She crosses to Jack and hugs him The Businessman turns

with a concerned look having overheard Jack indicates
to Anne that he feels awkward in front of the
Businessman Anne confronts the Businessman with as
little tact as possible

ANNE
(continuing)
Are you almost done

BUSINESSMAN
(flustered)
Well
ANNE
Whatta looking for -- a story

Jack hides his face so as not to laugh Anne ushers the
man out

ANNE
(continuing)

integrity underneath the peasant stock

JACK

to her desk)

Jack smiles weakly
ANNE
(continuing)

CUT TO

INT ANNES APARTMENT ABOVE THE STORE - NIGHT
Anne and Jack have just finished eating dinner

JACK
You know what the Holy Grail is

Anne takes a long drag then puts it out in her leftover
food Jack is repelled by the habit

ANNE
The Holy Grail Yeah I know that
It was like -- Jesus juice glass
Jack just stares at her
ANNE
(continuing)

Oh I used to be such a Catholic

JACK
You still believe in God

ANNE

Oh sure Gotta believe in God

(trying to be

intellectual)
But I dont think God made man in his
own image No Cause most of
the bullshit that happens is because
of men No I think man was made out
of the devils image and women were
created out of God -- because women
can have babies which is sorta like
creating and which also explains why
women are attracted to men because
lets face it the devil is a helluva

lot more interesting -- I slept with
a few saints and let me tell you
Booooorring And so the whole

point of life I think is for men
and women to get married so the devil
and God can live together and ya
know -- work it out

(Anne moves to him and
leans in for a kiss)
Not that we have to get married

Jack notices a brown spot on her chin and pulls away

JACK
»» You have a little uh
something on your face

ANNE
Oh I got a pimple This stuff is
supposed to blend with my skin
color Like it really works ya
know

Jack moves to the bar to fix a drink Anne follows him
and takes the drink out of his hand Jack knows what
this means

JACK
I dont think Im up to it tonight

Anne massages his shoulders

JACK
I had a very traumatic experience
IT

Anne nods but keeps massaging As long as he wasnt with
a woman she doesnt care Her massaging gets more
intense -- moving up his head and contorting his face as
he speaks

JACK
(continuing)
I think Im getting sick
(trying to be

forceful)
I I slept in a boiler room
Anne Im tired Im upset
Im just not in the mood Okay

Anne grabs his face with both hands and pulls him into a
kiss She proceeds to climb onto his body as she
utilizes a skill she picked up in high school make-out
parties She is a pro Jack against all his better
judgement and will -- despite the pimple cream -- is
rendered helpless by this womans passion He returns
the embrace and guides her to the floor

CUT TO

INT ANNES LIVING ROOM - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

Jack sits in his underwear on the living room floor
before an open closet with a cardboard box between his
legs The box is filled with tapes of Jacks past radio
shows He begins to sort through them reading titles
remembering moments then stops when he comes upon
newspaper clippings of the murder at Babbitts Edwin
Malnicks face stares at him from a yellowed front page
The memories sour He moves to the bar Anne exits the
bedroom

ANNE
Whatsa matter hon -- cant sleep

She sees the radio tapes

JACK
I tell you something Anne I really
feel like Im cursed

ANNE
Oh stop Things will change My
Aunt Mary always said theres a
remedy for everything in this world
except death and having no class

JACK
I get this feeling like Im a
magnet but I attract shit Out of
all the people in this city why did
I meet a man whos wife I killed

ANNE
You didnt kill anybody Stop

JACK
I wish there was some way I could
just pay the fine and go home

Anne crosses to Jack and gently touches him Jack turns
and clutches her to him tightly Lowering his head to
hers he cries

ANNE
I know I know honey

CUT TO

INT PARRYS BASEMENT - THE NEXT DAY

Jack is alone in the basement He slowly walks around
the room -- picking up little items here and there as if
trying to discover some clue to Parry He scans the
titles of the piles of books All of them have something
to do with medieval history or literature myths or the
Crusades He picks up one of the books and opens it
Page after page has been ripped out anywhere there might
have been a picture or a diagram He comes upon a large
scroll that he unravels It is a map drawn by Parry of
Langdon Carmichaels house and the surrounding blocks
He rolls it up The Pinnochio doll sits on a broken
chair facing the wall with the nightmarish scribblings
acting like a sentinel

He crosses to the prominent picture of the maiden with
the long hair He notices a small stand before the
picture with a candle It is like a shrine with
offerings a flower a small perfume sampler a box of
Jawbreakers candy and a dime store romance novel Jack
doesnt understand

FRANK (0OS)
Can I help you

EXT CORNER OUTSIDE METROPOLITAN LIFE BUILDING-LATER THAT DAY

JACK approaches PARRY from across the street he is sitting on
top of a car near a souvlaki vendor and eyeing A CLOCK TOWER
across the street and to the left of the building HE studies
the time as he recites under his breath (we only hear excerpts)

PARRY

Soveriegn princess of his captive heart
what dire affliction has thou made me
suffer thus banished from thy presence
with reproach and fettered by thy rigorous
command not to appear again before thy
beautiful face Deign princess to remember
this thy faithful slave who now endures
such misery for love of thee

JACK
Parry

PARRY smiles casually and without looking at Jack says

PARRY
Hi Jack

HE then returns his gaze to the clock which is approaching NOON

and after several more aggressive co-workers exit PARRYS
DAMSEL in distress appears out of a revolving door but
quickly gets revolved back into the building

PARRY
Shell be back

Finally Lydia makes an exit

PARRY

REACTION SHOT OF A BEWILDERED JACK as he looks at

LYDIA - a dowdy waif-like sparrow of a thing - makes her

way through the lobby SHE is torturously self-conscious
clumsy formless and plain She wears loose frocks that give
her no shape and make her appear to be swimming in material

SHE wears no make-up her unstyled hair is kept off her face

by a single beret that keeps sliding down her head and her
contact lens are always dry causing her to blink and use drops

JACK
Yeah gorgeousLook Im going
I just wanted to give you

Starts to dig in his pocket but Parry is already off

PARRY
Lets go

JACK follows

EXT CHINESE RESTAURANT - DAY
Behind the glass in interior we can see LYDIA sitting by herself
eating lunch CAMERA PANS OUT TO THE STREET where PARRY

and JACK are sitting on the hood of a car watching

PARRY
She loves dumplings Its her
Wednesday ritual

LYDIA raises a dumpling to her lips with a pair of chopsticks
SHE then accidentally drops it into a dish of soy sauce and
splatters her dress Unnerved she hastily wipes herself down
knocking over a glass of water when she removes the napkin

PARRY
Isnt she sweet She does that every time

Jack squints at Lydia as if trying to see what Parry
sees

CUT TO

INT BOOKSTAND NEAR GRAND CENTRAL STATION - DAY

But look at that jaw

Jack doesnt want to look If the Little People made

hope

CUT TO

her office building once again waiting her turn to dive
into the revolving doors She disappears into the
building

JACK
Do you follow her every day

PARRY
Huh-huh Im deeply smitten

JACK
Whats her name

PARRY
I dont know

A businessman walking in the opposite direction throws a
candy wrapper on the street as he passes Jack and Parry
Parry suddenly stops outraged pulls out a slingshot and
fires a stone at the mans head The businessman is hit
but doesnt know how since Parry grabs Jacks arm and
resumes walking casually in the opposite direction

JACK
Why did you do that

PARRY
Well if every time someone did
something offensive they hit in the
head with a pebble I think
they might alter their behavior
What do you think Jack

Before Jack can respond PARRY spots a rummage find

PARRY
Oh look A cooler

Parry spots an abandoned COOLER filled with junk and starts
going through it Things are getting weird again so JACK
seizes the moment to accomplish his initial task - he pulls
out a fifty dollar bill and hands it to PARRY

JACK
HereI just would like to help
you I thoughtmaybeyou
could use some money

PARRY
Fifty dollars

JACK digs deeper and hands him a twenty PARRY is dumbfounded
JACK
Heres another twenty Will that do
(sorting through his change)

HE hugs him on the street which embarasses JACK to no end

JACK
(pulling away)

JACK walks away CAMERA stays on JACK for a few yards until he
turns around and sees

an imaginary phone

PARRY breaks away from him HE falls back onto the ground
THE SCREAM STOPS and is replaced by an eerie SILENCE

As if sound were ripped out of space

JACK speaks but no

sound comes outWe are in PARRYS world for this brief
momentJACK leans over to help PARRY but the latter inches

awayfearful of the vision he sees
looming over JACK breathing FIERY SMOKE
PARRY off the ground and in doing so

comes into full view

A MAGNIFICENT BURNISHED RED STEED

something out of sight
JACK tries to raise
the vision for PARRY

- a helmeted figure with a beard in a flowing red cap
holding a lance He stares at Parry Closing his eyes

Parry raises his hands to protect himself
Jack looks around and sees nothing He acts with great concern

JACK
(Mouthing in silence)
Perryyou all right

HE embraces PARRY by the shoulders PARRY turns to him opening
his eyes then turns back to the KNIGHT to discover that

The HORSE and the KNIGHT have moved several feet away and

are continuing to back upas if in retreat

JACK speaks as the sound is returned

JACK

PARRY smiles in amazement

PARRY
He knows who you are

JACK exhausted and bedraggled climbs the rock to follow
He reaches the top panting

JACK
OhOhOh GodIm dying

HE finds PARRY sitting Buddha-like on the top of the rock
calmly gazing out at the beautiful scenery before him

PARRY

We wouldve had his ass if we had horses
Hes running scared

JACK

Frustrated JACK turns to leave but this time there is a sound -
someone is crying OS

PARRY
wees Do you hear that Oh
Heaven be praised in giving me an
opportunity so soon of fulfilling the
duties of my professionThese cries
doubtless proceed from some miserable male
or female who stands in need of my
immediate aid and protection

And hes offA reluctant JACK pauses before following

JACK
This is too hard

INT EMERGENCY ROOM - LATER

In a room at the end of the line of chairs PARRY stands holding
the GAY BUM JACK stands a safe distance away unable to

take his eyes off the scene before him seated against the

wall are an assortment of derelicts drunks screaming withdrawl
victims and jacketed schizophrenics JACK has a hard time moving

PARRY
(to JACK referring to GAY BUM)
Will you watch him for a minute

Before Jack can respond PARRY shifts the GAY BUMS body

into JACKS arms then moves about the room introducing
himself to the various patients as JACK watches HE moves

down the linesaying hello wiping peoples brows

holding the hands of an angry bag lady mumbling incoherently
Smiling and saying hello to each one no matter how frightening
they seem HE appears to have a soothing affect

GAY BUM

JACK stares at him at a complete loss for a response

GAY BUM

JACK against all better judgement pats the BUMS hand in
comfort Unexpectedly the GAY BUM leans his head on JACKS
shoulder and cries JACK wide-eyed with embarassment looks
over to PARRY -

That and the fact that all my friends are

At that moment a PIZZA BOY enters making a delivery

PIZZA BOY

Suddenly DOCTORS and NURSES appear out of the wood work and
swarm around the delivery boy

CUT TO
INT GRAND CENTRAL STATION A BANK - RUSH HOUR

PARRY and JACK sit on the floor enjoying a cup of coffee
A VIETNAM VET in a wheelchair with no legs sits near the opposite
wall along with at least fifteen other homeless beggers

Another MAN sits against a cash machine crying A WOMAN passes
by and drops some change in the VETs cup without saying
a word The Vet SID smiles broadly

SID
God Bless You Have a nice day
(to Jack and Parry)
Ya hear Jimmy Nickels got picked up
yesterday

Parry is too busy scanning the Grand Central main floor
to answer Realizing Parry isnt answering Jack feels
obliged to pick up the conversation

JACK
Oh yeah

SID
He got caught --
(passer-by drops coins in
cup)
God bless Have a safe trip home
(to Jack)
-- Got caught pissin on the
bookstore Mans a pig No excuse
for that Were heading for social
anarchy when people start pissing on
bookstores

Jack smiles at this observation He then tries to get
Parrys attention
JACK
Youll never see her in this crowd

Parry doesnt answer He looks like a dog waiting for
its master People walk by Jack at a frantic pace He
sits uncomfortably against a wall A man almost steps on
him as he walks by and tosses a coin at Sid missing the
cup and forcing Sid to bend over Jack picks the coin
up for him

SID
Bless you

JACK
Asshole Guy didnt even look at
you

SID

(takes coin)
Hes paying so he dont have to look
What he doesnt know is hes paying
for a service Guy goes to work
every day and for eight hours seven
days a week he bends over and gets
it right up the ass till he cant
stand

Parry stands up and begins pacing before the main floor

SID
(continuing)
But one day right before

quitting time on Friday his boss is
going say something like Say Bob --
come into my office and kiss my
ass and Bob is going think --
The hell with it I dont care what
happens All I want right now is to
see the expression on his face when I
stab him with these pair of
scissors

Parry looks at the clock above the information booth --
500

SID
(continuing)
But then he thinks of me -- wait
a minute he says Its not so

bad At least I got two arms and two
legs and I aint beggin for money
He puts down the scissors and
puckers up

Jack is impressed with this man
SID
(continuing)
Im what you call a moral traffic
light Its like Im saying Red --
go no further

OS a black woman begins to sing Jack and Sid look

SID
(continuing smiles with
respect)
Ah Margaret

CUT TO

INT GRAND CENTRAL STATION - PHOTO LAB - RUSH HOUR

MARGARET a black woman in a paisley kaften stands near
a photo lab across from Jack and Sid With a box in
front of her for donations she starts singing (SONG to
be chosen) Some rush hour commuters stop to listen
Her VOICE is strong and soulful she performs
uninhibitedly

SID
You have to admit though Like at
500 in Grand Central Pretty

breathtaking dont cha think
Jack looks around this mad rush hour scene taking it in
through Sids eyes Parry however keeps his gaze on

the main floor Suddenly he spots her

CUT TO

INT GRAND CENTRAL STATION - MAIN FLOOR

Hordes of people are moving in every which way
zigzagging across the floor Lydia moves through the
crowd avoiding touching anyone

PARRY

CAMERA PANS IN SLOWLY as we hear Margarets SONG OS
The closer the CAMERA gets to Parry the more her song

changes At first a blend of two melodies that sound

distruptive cachophonous But as Parry smiles with

joy HIS SONG overtakes Margarets It is a WALTZ
CUT TO

MAIN FLOOR - PARRYS POV
The hordes of people continue their zigzagging for a beat
then

Suddenly they pair up and waltz around the main floor
circling around the center information booth

Only Lydia remains walking -- gliding through the dancers
with grace and ease

Parry watches in a state of rapture -- moving as she
moves to keep her in eye view as long as possible

CUT TO

JACK

listening to Margarets SONG taking in the scene around
him watching people listen to her song while others
walk by as if they were deaf and blind

Feeling strangely at ease strangely apart of everyone
around him -- a group of lost souls listening to a woman
bare her soul in song He looks to spot Parry rises and
crosses to him

CUT TO

MAIN FLOOR

Parry watches as Lydia exits the main floor (the waltz
has ended) just as Jack speaks his line

JACK
Its such a great song

PARRY
(referring to his own
song)
Its a classic

Jack looks in the direction of Parrys stare and sees
Lydia exit
PARRY
(continuing)
God Just one night with her Id
die happy

Jack hears this as if a light bulb went off above his
head

CUT TO

INT LYDIAS APARTMENT - DUSK
A door opens Lydia enters with a bag of groceries she
picked up on the way She turns on the light to reveal
an extremely neat albiet modest one bedroom apartment
She carries the grocery bag into the kitchen

Out of the bag she removes a Lean Cuisine a giant
bottle of cream soda and four giant bars of Chunky
chocolate She pops the Lean Cuisine into the oven and
walks back into the living room to an old stereo She
turns the TURNTABLE on -- a record already set upon it
She stands by her coffee table as if taking position

Suddenly we hear ETHEL MERMAN -- as Lydia lip-syncs
every word with complete commitment -- giving a full out
performance

ETHELLYDIA

Got no sunshine got no rain
Still I think Im a lucky dame
I got the sun in the morning
And the moon at night

Her attempts at hand gestures and choreography are

awkward -- bunking into the coffee table banging her
hand against a lamp -- but we see a part of Lydia that
few (actually no one) sees Her abandon her joy her

smile From upstairs neighbors BANG for her to keep the
music down Lydia casually crosses to the stereo turns
off the turntable and heads back to the kitchen -- as if
the neighbors interference were all apart of her nightly
ritual

CUT TO

INT ANNES APARTMENT - NIGHT

Anne sits alone at her formica table smoking a
cigarette Two plates are set She waits for Jack She
is hurt and pissed off TONY ORLANDO AND DAWN play on

pipes

The song continues as the CAMERA SLOWLY PANS up to
CLOSEUP of Anne who is fighting with an imaginary Jack

ANNE

EXT CENTRAL PARK - SHEEPS MEADOW - NIGHT

PARRY
What a beautiful night

HE walks deeper into the open field This makes JACK nervous

JACK
Dont you think its time to go now
Running around here during the day is
one thing but at night we could be killed
by a wide variety of people

PARRY
Well thats stupid This is my park
just as much as it is theirs You
think its fair they keep us out
just because they make us think well
get killed or something

JACK
Yes I think thats very fair

PARRY takes off his pants and stands there naked

JACK
(continuing)
sees What are you doing

PARRY
Have you ever done any cloudbusting
You lie on your back and you
concentrate on the cloudsand you try yo
break them apart with your mind
Its wild

Parry lies down

JACK
You cant do this This is New York
Nobody lies in naked in a field in New
YorkItsits too Midwestern

PARRY
Come on try it Ya feel the
air on your body - ya little
fellas flappin in the breeze
everybody in the city is busy
with their business and no one knows were
bare assed in the middle of it Come on

JACK
NO I will not This is nuts

(freaked walking OC)
This is too nutsIm leaving I mean it

JACK starts walking away from PARRY talking to himself -

JACK
-HaLittle fella I mean

hes naked in the middle of Central
Park I should be surprised Im
not surprised Im fucking outta

YOURE OUT OF YOUR FUCKING MIND

PARRY (0S)
Bingo

CUT TO
EXT CENTRAL PARK SHEEPS MEADOW - TEN MINUTES LATER - NIGHT
JACK fully clothed lies next to PARRY looking up at the clouds

JACK
Theyre not moving

THEY stare up JACK raises his head HE unbuttons his shirt -
maybe that will help

JACK
What if some homophobic jogger runs by and
kills us to get back at his overbearing father

Parry remains focused on the sky - in his own world
Something about cloudbusting makes Parry behave in a way we havent
seen beforeHe is un characteristically quiet

JACK
JACK LUCAS FOUND DEAD - BESIDE
A DEAD NAKED MANTHE TWO WERE
DEADHIS COMPANION WAS NAKEDI hate
when they use the word companionIts

so insinuatingAlthough itll probably boost my
biography sales The public loves

stories about successful people falling into
degenerate behavior Makes them feel

lucky to be boring and ordinaryPeople stink

Parry suddenly speaks - as if talking to a lecture hall

PARRY
Are there any questions

JACK
What

PARRY
Then lets begin with the story itself
Its a story of the Grail mythAnd although
there are several variations my favorite
begins with the Fisher King as a young boy
who had to spend a night alone in the forest
to prove his courage and during that night
he is visited by a sacred vision Out of the
fire appears the Holy Grail - Gods highest symbol of
divine grace And a voice says to the boy
You shall be the guardian of the Grail that it
may heal the hearts of menBut the boy was
overcome Innocent and foolish he was
blinded by greater visions - a life ahead filled
with beauty and glory hope and powerTears
filled his eyes as he sensed his own invincibility
A boys tears of naive wonder and inspiration
and in this state ofradical amazementhe felt
for a brief moment not like a boy but like God
(Jack listens intently)
And so he reached into the fire to take the Grail
And the Grail vanished And the boy hands were
left caught in the flamesleaving him wounded
and ashamed at what his recklessness had lost him
When he became King he was determined to
reclaim his destiny and find the Grail
But with each year that passed with each
campaign he fought the Grail remained lost and
this wound he suffered in the fire grew worse
He became a bitter man Life for him lost its reason
With each disappointment with each betrayal
with each loss this wound would grow
Soon the land began to spoil from neglect
and his people starvedUntil finally
the King lost all faith in Gods existance and in
mans valueHe lost his ability to love or be loved
And he was so sick with experience
that he started to die As the years went on
his bravest knights would search for the
Grail that would heal their King and
make them the most respected and valued men in
the land but to no avail Pretty soon finding
the Grail became a ruthless struggle between ambitious
men vying for the Kings power which only confirmed
the Kings worst suspicions of man causing his
wound to grow His only hope he thought was death
Then one day a fool was brought in to the King

to cheer him He was a simple-minded man

not particularly skilledor admired He

tells the King some jokessing him some songs

but the King feels even worseFinally the

fool says What is it that hurts you so much

How can I helpAnd the King says I need

a sip of water to cool my throatSo the fool
takes a cup from the bedstand fills it with

water and hands it to the KingSuddenly

the King feels a lot better And when he looks

to his hands he sees that it was the Holy Grail

the fool handed himan ordinary cup that had been
beside his bed all alongAnd the King asks

How can this behow could you find what

all my knights and wisest men could not find

And the fool answers I dont know I only

knew you were thirsty And for the first time
since he was a boy the King felt more than a man -
not because he was touched by Gods glorybut
rather by the compassion of a fool

JACK doesnt know how to respond HEs never known PARRY to
be eloquent HE gets a glimpse of PARRY as he once was and

the words come out of his mouth before he knows it

JACK
Im so sorry

But PARRY seems far away HE speaks like a professor

PARRY
The Fisher King myth has alot of
derivationsI remember I was at

this lecture in Princeton once -
and there was this one speakerHenry Sa
HenryuhHenry

HE stops As if this memory escaped with any warning
PARRY
(continuing)

What was I saying

JACK is as surprised as he is PARRYS face is frightened
and confused again There is panic in his voice

PARRY
(continuing)

What was I saying

HE raises his head to look and sees
EXT SHEEPS MEADOW SEVERAL YARDS AWAY - NIGHT

THE DARK SILOUETTE OF THE RED KNIGHT UPON HIS HORSE Staring -
knowing exactly where PARRY lies even though its dark

PARRY looks frightened as he lays his head back down
JACK tries to snap him out of it by saying

JACK
How come youve never asked that
girl for a date

PARRY looks back to see that the RED KNIGHT has vanished
HE snaps out of it somewhat

PARRY
I cant ask for herI have to earn her

JACK
Parry you dont have to earn a woman
Its the twentieth century

PARRY
Maybe when we get the Grail

JACK
Well see I think she can helpYou know
women are greattheythey make homes
and theyya know kill the livestock
so the knights can go out and get
Grails andand slaughter villages with a
clear headI mean where would Arthur be
without Guinevere

PARRY
Happily married probably

JACK
Bad example Just trust me A woman who loves
you keeps you goinggives you strength
Makes you feel like you can do anything

PARRY
Is that what your girlfriend does for you

JACK
(hesitates then lies)

decides to be positive

INT TWO HEARTS PUBLISHING - MOMENTS LATER

THE GAY BUM strolls nonchalantly into the office and down the aisle
relishing in the amazed expressions of the employees HE approaches
a cubicle on which he reads a small name plate - LYDIA SINCLAIR
LYDIA has her back to him but slowly turns as she feels someone
watching her SHE lets out a tiny scream when she sees him

standing there like a deranged clown The GAY BUM take notice of
her outfit - a cordoroy forest green jumper with a lime

green turtleneck -

GAY BUM
You MUST be SHE

LYDIA
Huh

THE GAY BUM begins to sing a SONG PARODY to the tune of a
classical musical number (Song to be chosen) After a big finish
the GAY BUM hands LYDIA a business card drops the act and exits

GAY BUM
(murmurs cynically)

Jesus

Stunned LYDIA looks down at the information card she holds
frozen in her hand

INT VIDEO STOP - 530 THE NEXT DAY
CU on ANNE who is slighted repulsed by PARRY
JACK PARRY his hair slicked back wearing a Video Spot T-shirt
over his clothes Jack hangs a car pine freshner around PARRYs
neck to help with the smellThe bell on front door jingles

LYDIA cautiously enters the store

Behind the counter JACK spots her immediately and nudges ANNE
SHE turns to look her bra straps are visible JACK fixes them

LYDIA
Hello My name is Lydia Sinclair

JACK

Napolitano the owner of Video Spot

LYDIA
(continuing curt)
So how do we do this

JACK
Wellumyou get an official
membership card

Just sign that and well laminate it
right here Parry You want to
laminate Miss Sinclairs card

Parry stands staring at her

JACK
(continuing)
Parry

Parry snaps out of it and crosses from behind the counter
to the laminating machine next to Jack

ANNE
This will last you one year after
which you have the option to renew

if you like at a membership
discount
LYDIA
(defensive)

But now its free right

ANNE
Yeah

Anne backs off She stands next to an equally perplexed
Jack as they watch Lydia fill out the card Her abrasive
demeanor is not what they expected Lydia finishes the
card and pushes it toward them

LYDIA
Now what
JACK
Uh you you can pick out up to
ten movies

LYDIA
Free

JACK
Yes Theyre free

ANNE
(butts in)
Only the first ten After that
theyre 299 a rental

Lydia eyes Anne suspiciously then turns to survey the
shelves Parry picks up her card and laminates it -- all
the while keeping his eyes fixed upon Lydias every
move Anne and Jack having set the trap watch with
interest

Lydia surveys the film boxes H-L She spots one of
interest and pulls it off the shelf -- causing two other
boxes to fall down on her She catches one box and as
she replaces it back on the shelf causes three more to
fall She catches two of the three

Parry Anne and Jack watching with an odd fascination
Jack nudges Parry to forget the laminating and go help
her Parry gathers up his nerve and moves from around
the counter up behind her

PARRY
» Can can I help you
Lydia quickly turns -- she is uncomfortable by his
closeness
LYDIA
No No I can look myself
She moves away abruptly -- like a fox terrier who

pretends to ignore the mess she made on the living room
rug

Parry turns to Jack and Anne as if to say what do I do
now Jack encourages him to keep trying Parry
organizes the boxes and picks one out

PARRY
How about the Hell Merchants

LYDIA
I dont like horror movies

PARRY
(reads)
How about Zbiegnew Speizaks The
Purple Bread an intensely portrayed
tale of love and envy set against the
sweeping background of a Polish
bakery In subtitles

LYDIA

I dont like uh
(finding it hard to
categorize)

Polish love stories
(she turns her back
on him but adds)

I like musicals

PARRY
(encouraged)
Well we have plenty of those Right
over here We got the MGM series
Astaire and Rogers the Judy
Garlands

LYDIA
Got any Ethel Merman

He doesnt see any He looks to Anne who shakes her
head

PARRY
Uh we seem to be all out of

PARRY

Jack nudges Anne to do something

ANNE
You know I think I ordered some
just the other day

LYDIA
Well did you or didnt you

ANNE
(pissed off)
Yes Theyll be in soon

LYDIA
Well I guess Ill come back then

JACK

Lydia walks back to the counter As Jack hands her the
card she notices Annes painted star fingernails

LYDIA
I like your nails Where did you get
them done

ANNE
Ah I do them myself I used to
work in a beauty parlor

Lydia keeps staring at them She says blankly

LYDIA
I like the stars

Jack gets an idea

JACK
You know Anne does other people too
Sort of a sideline
(Anne is surprised to hear

this
If you want she could do your
nails
LYDIA
How much
JACK
Well since youre a member we
could
ANNE
(interrupts)

Twenty dollars

Lydia considers the offer Parry waits for the outcome

LYDIA
Okay twenty dollars When can

JACK

Tonight Hows tonight

Lydia thinks Anne is ready to kill Jack Parry smiles
hopefully

CUT TO

INT ANNES APARTMENT - THAT EVENING

Jack searches frantically through a closet Anne and
Parry sit opposite each other at the table Parry is
eating Annes homecooking voraciously Anne doesnt
quite know how to take Parry who smiles mischieviously
through his meal

ANNE
(to Jack OS)
Getting your nails done is one thing
but going to dinner with a bunch of
strangers and him She didnt even
look at him

PARRY
Got any more bread crust

As Anne resentfully rises and crosses into the kitchen
Parry focuses on her robust breasts bouncing beneath the
sweater Annes expression as she serves him is a

mixture of repulsion and fascination She sits at the
table
JACK (OS)
Well make it very casual not like

a date or anything I just have to
find something hell look good in

Anne looks at Parry as if this were an impossibility

Parry smiles back -- he likes Anne
ANNE
I dont know Hes a little
disgusting Although some women go
for that
JACK (OS)

He just needs some clothes

PARRY
Got any more starchy food

Another opportunity to watch Annes breasts in action as
she reluctantly rises to get him more macaroni She
returns with the pot

ANNE
I mean Ive gone out with bums but
they were gorgeous Its the only
reason to go out with a bum

PARRY
This foods delicious Youre a
wonderful cook And you have a
lovely home

ANNE
Jack hes starting a conversation

JACK (OS)
Well talk back He wont bite you
ANNE
(cool and polite)
Thank you very much

PARRY
(enjoying the conversation)
Your welcome You know a
beautiful woman like yourself -- your
own business -- Im surprised some
guy doesnt snatch you up for his
own

Anne looks in Jacks direction but replies to Parry

ANNE
Youre surprised But I guess I
just never met the right guy Whatta
gonna do

PARRY
Im shocked With a child bearing
body like yours
(Anne doesnt know how
to take that)
- why a man would have to be out of
his mind

ANNE
Most men are

PARRY
Why this is outrageous

Parry getting overly heated slams down his fork Anne
jumps

PARRY
(continuing)
A woman of your value going to
waste before my eyes
(rising intensity)
Come on Im yours Lets go
(clears the table with
one move)
Come on -- let us go to that place of
splendor in the grass

He starts to unzip his pants

ANNE
Jack

Climbing over the table to her he seranades

PARRY
Holdin my penis

Much ya like me

ANNE
What are you out of your mind

Jack enters

PARRY

JACK

Parry stops singing and gets off the table He bows to
her

PARRY
(kidding)

You sure now

Anne looks at him like shes going to belt him

PARRY
(continuing)
Well alright But you let me

know

(with great

sincerity)
Youre too good a woman to go to
waste

Anne in spite of herself agrees with him She looks to
Jack to see if he agrees but Jack is too busy inspecting
Parry

JACK
What are you -- a 40 in a jacket

Anne frustrated with the two of them exits

EXT VIDEO POP - NIGHT

self-consiously as if to say Yeah Im here

ANNE
Hello welcome Come in
Lydia enters subtly inspecting the apartment

LYDIA

a store You always pass them on the
street but you never think anyone
really lives in them

ANNE
(raising an eyebrow)
Can I get you anythingcoffee
teaa little tequilla

LYDIA
No thank you

LYDIA sits at the formica table already set up with nail care
paraphernalia - with the gleaming steel nail files it looks a

bit like surgery equipment

LYDIA

Will it hurt
ANNE
(threateningly)

That all depends on you

Sure you dont want a drink
LYDIAs a little nervous about this attempt at nail beauty

CUT TO

INT PARRYS BASEMENT - NIGHT

ANNE makes a confident nod LYDIA sips

LYDIA
My parents were divorced

ANNE

My Aunt used to say
(emphasizing)
divorce is the sister-in-law of death

ANNE nods knowingly LYDIA squints as she considers this
CUT TO

JACK stands behind a seated PARRY in front of a mirror
PARRYS hair is wet JACK places a can of styling mousse

in front of him PARRY squeezes a ball of mousse in his hand
then applies it to his headPARRY proceeds to experiment
with a number of styles - adding more and more mousse as JACK
watches in silence PARRY molds his hair into a cone then
divides into two cones then mushes it into a pompadour then
splits the pompadour - PARRY is having a wonderful time -
applying enormous amounts to his head and eyebrowsFinally
JACK grabs the can out of PARRYS hand

CUT BACK TO
INT ANNES APARTMENT - A LITTLE LATER

ANNE works on LYDIAS other hand as LYDIA sips her tequilla
from a straw

ANNE

SHE moves to picks up her tequilla with the manicured hand but
ANNE eyes her down

ANNE
Well dont say it like that Its not

missed a great deal

CUT TO
INT PARRYS BASEMENT - NIGHT

PARRY cleaned and dressed up - his hair moussed back the suit

tries to staple the sleeves of the suit shorter for PARRYs arms

JACK

PARRY puts

JACK
Survival

his arm on JACKS shoulder and speaks very sincerely

PARRY
(earnest)
You love her alot Jack Youre
crazy about herIts just that

sometimes youre a little bit of an asshole

JACK is surprised by the remark and abruptly focuses on PARRY

INT ANNES APARTMENT - LATER

LYDIA is a little more loose and talkative now as ANNE refills
then takes LYDIAS other hand to apply the stars

her glass

LYDIA
(deadpan)
-My mother calls every week
Like a recurring nightmare

So have you met anyoneNo mom

So whats going to happen

I only thank God I moved out

ANNE

I cant believe you lived with

her for that long If I had to live
with my mother Id stab myself six

LYDIA
I think some people are meant to be
(she takes a slug)
Maybe I was a man in a former life
and I used women for pleasure so
now Im paying for it - which would
be fine if I could just remember
some of the pleasure parts
(drinks)

ANNE
I dont understand you What is the

LYDIA

times

problem

I dont feel like I make any impression on people

At office parties I spend my time
re-arranging the hors doeuvres as people eat
them so the platters will always look full
I dont start conversations because I have

no idea how to end themI think Im

just meant to live in the background

of things

ANNE
Thats not trueYou gotta ease up
Conversations have a life of their own
You gotta just go with itWere having
a lovely conversation

LYDIA
(bluntly)
Im paying you

ANNE drops her hand SHEs pissed

LYDIA smiles at the thought of having such an impressionable
personality

EXT VIDEO POP - NIGHT
JACK tries to calm PARRY down

JACK
Come hereyoure all crooked
(HANDS HIM WALLET)
Heres my wallet so you can pay for dinner

JACK adjusts PARRYS tie then undoes it and re-ties
PARRY takes wallet keeping his eyes on JACK as JACK primps him

PARRY
Youre a nice man Jack
Doing all this for me
JACK doesnt pay attention as PARRYS expression grows pale and
frightened HE suddenly raps his arms around JACK and whispers

PARRY
Im scared Jack

JACK uncomfortable at the intimacy tries to comfort him

PARRY
I feel so much for herI
feel like something awful is going to happen

JACK
No Nothing bads going to happen
Annell be there Ill be there
Nothing bad will happen

PARRY
Im still scared

CUT BACK TO
INT ANNES APARTMENT - NIGHT

ANNE and LYDIA share a drink

ANNE
Its hard being a woman I dont care what
anybody saysPeople say we have choices -
we have no choicesMy grandma used to
say that for a woman in this world behind
every door theres either deathor husband

LYDIA cracks up laughing

LYDIA
Sister-in-law of deathThats wonderful

SHE takes another sip as JACK knocks on the door and enters with PARRY
JACK
Anne
(to LYDIA)
Oh hi Hows it going

Lydia loses her smile and becomes self-conscious and protective

JACK
Parry its Lydia Sinclair - our membership winner

PARRY
I know

JACK turns to find that PARRY is still outside the apartment
HE crosses to PARRY The two whisper intensely

ANNE
What are you two up to

JACK
Welleverythings closed up

(overplaying it)
SayAnybody up for Chinese
(to LYDIA)
Have you eaten Would you

Oh noI have to get home

ANNE

Listen you still have to eat

PARRY stands in bg with JACK whispering

LYDIA
No reallyI cant

ANNE
Hey What did I tell you
Why dont you come Its just dinner
Youll have something to tell

LYDIA smiles as PARRY and JACK reach an agreement
All four turn to each other spontaneously and say

ANNE JACK LYDIA PARRY
Fine

CUT TO
EXT STREET NEAR BROOKLYN BRIDGE - NIGHT
PARRY and LYDIA walk and talk ANNE and JACK walk behind them

LYDIA
IuhI get to read some of the books
but mostly Ijust calculate production
costs from first edition hard cover
publication to paperback After
paperback its basically someone
elses problem

PARRY
It sounds exciting

LYDIA
Why does it sound exciting Theres
absolutely nothing exciting about it
As Parry talks he picks up a piece of garbage on the sidewalk

PARRY

Well youre calculating costs that
could have an affect on whether or

not the book is published and if

it is it could be a book that
might somehow change the way people
think or act - a book can do that

And you would be a part of creating

a cultural shift that could change

our society forever

Parry drops the garbage in a garbage can and is almost
about to browse through it when

JACK
Parry

Parry is alerted by Jack that this would be inappropriate
However he does take a wire champagne cork wrapper indiscreetly

LYDIA
We mostly publish trashy romance novels

PARRY
Well - empires have fallen
because of trashy romances

Parry seems to be fashioning something out of the wire

PARRY

(continuing)
Romance is romance no matter what kind
it isIt could be a Victorian lady
kidnapped by a viral sea captain
with a hairy chestor a horny pizza boy
seduced by a housewife with a hairy upper lip
As long as theres heart passion
and little bit of fantasyromance is
the stuff of dreamstheres always
more to trash than meets the eye

With this Parry shows her his creation - a little wire chair
made from the champagne wire Lydia is impressed Their
eyes meet for a dangerous moment until

A LARGE MAN walks by bumping into LYDIA without apology and
knocking Parrys gift to the ground

PARRY
-Hey

The LARGE MAN continues walking as PARRY reaches to his back
pocket to pull out his SLINGSHOT when
JACKANNE
PARRY

PARRY begrudgingly lets him go

MARTIN (0S)
ParryParry - is that you

Parry spots a familiar homeless face sitting on the curb

PARRY
Hey Martin

MARTIN
Dont you look all duded up

PARRY
This is Lydia

MARTIN
Nice to meet you Lydia Got a quarter

PARRY smiles proudly A mortified LYDIA reachs in her purse
and hands Martin a quarterAnne and Jack watch in disbelief

MARTIN
Thank you God bless
(to Parry)
Nice girlHave you set the date yet

Lydia hurries away Parry followsThe walk continues

LYDIA
How do you know him

PARRY
We were neighbors for a couple for weeks
on Sutton Place

Lydia
You lived on Sutton Place

PARRY
(proudly)
Yep Right on it

ANNE
(tries to save it)
Huhthe restaurants just around the
corner here

They nod After a beat Lydia asks

LYDIA
What do you do - for a living I mean

PARRY
Well Im in search of the Holy Grail
JACK smacks his own forehead exasperated ANNE gives up
CUT TO
INT CHINESE RESTAURANT - NIGHT

ANNE and LYDIA sit opposite JACK and PARRY
THEY are served three large orders of dumplings

ANNE
OhI could eat all of these

LYDIA is nervous about this As everyone begins to eat SHE
eyes her chopsticks with reluctance

PARRY looks at her and smiles encouragingly

LYDIA forces a smile back picks up her chopsticks and dives in
PARRY watches her in adoration JACK subtly tries to get PARRY
to stop staring But PARRY is glued to his vision

LYDIA even more awkward now with her new nails drops her first
dumpling into her lap

LYDIA
Ohgod

To save her from embarassment PARRY drops his dumpling into his
lap as well

PARRY
Oh boy

LYDIA takes her napkin and dips it into a glass of water
PARRY follows suit

When LYDIA removes the napkin her glass falls over
PARRY forces his glass over as well

ANNE and JACK are looking at this mirror exercise in fascination
PARRY
(to LYDIA)

Cant take us anywhere huh

LYDIA cant help but smile - a little more at ease now Grateful
she is not the clumsy center of attention

JACK leans over and whispers to ANNE

JACK
What do you think

ANNE
I think theyre made for each other
And it scares me
FADE TO
LATER IN THE EVENING
WE PAN the table as everyone eats their main courses

LYDIA we discover has another eating idiosyncracy SHE
unconsciously but quite loudly smacks her mouth when she chews

LYDIA (0C)
SMACK SMACKSMACK

WE HEAR THIS SMACKING OFF CAMERA as we begin on JACK trying not
to look at LYDIA but having difficulty enjoying his own meal
CAMERA moves to PARRY staring at her helplessly in love not
paying any attention to his own food moving to LYDIA SMACK
SMACKING beginning to accept PARRYS attraction in her and
warming up to the idea SHE throws a smile at him in between
smacks and finally ANNE chewing quietly staring at JACK
with her eyes widened twice their normal size indicating her
disbelief at LYDIAS vocal variety of noises

CUT TO
PARRY

gazing at his sweetheart a song to seranade comes to
mind and he softly begins

PARRY
Lydia Oh Lydia That
encyclopedia Oh Lydia the tattooed

lady

His gentle voice counterbalances the odd lyrics and makes
it sound like a love song

Anne eyes Jack to stop him

Jack is about to make an attempt but cant seem to find
the way so he doesnt bother

Lydia doesnt know how to respond either At first she
smiles politely then she pretends to be too busy eating
to listen -- but something about Parrys sincerity pulls
her in His face glows as he floats the lyrics across
the table to her Slowly her smacking subsides she
lowers her fork forgets her self-consciousness and
listens to Parry -- slightly hypnotized like a little
girl watching a ballerina for the first time

Jack is fascinated by Parrys complete adoration of this
mess of a woman He looks to Anne who tries to continue
her meal nonchalantly He notices her bra strap hanging
out from her sweater
CAMERA CUTS BACK AND FORTH between the exposed strap and
Jack as Parry continues seranading 0S Anne realizes
Jack is staring at her and immediately thinks somethings
wrong But Jack just smiles at her His hand reaches
across the table not to fix her sweater but to take her
hand Anne is in shock She slips her hand into his and
smiles back her eyes almost tearing

When Parry finishes he smiles

PARRY
Would it be all right I mean would
you mind if I walked you home

tonight

Lydia nods From 0S Parrys hand holds a napkin and
gently dabs a stain of soy sauce on her sleeve

CUT TO
EXT VIDEO SPOT - NIGHT

ANNE
I tell ya Im very surprised
She seemed to go for him Hmmm
Theres somebody for everybody huh

JACK very pleased with himself

JACK

in hardware stores

JACK
Nothing its justI begining to understand you

ANNE
(smiles)
WellI think you should feel very
proud You did a real nice thing

JACK

HE kisses her hard and long ANNE pulls away to catch her breath
SHE is surprised to say the least

ANNE

JACK tenderly brushes her hair off her face HE kisses her again

ANNE

PARRY
What are we about to do

LYDIA
Well youre walking me home I

to me and youll want to come
upstairs for coffee

PARRY

I dont drink coffee

LYDIA

complex)

PARRY
I dont drink coffee

LYDIA
And then well exchange phone numbers
and youll leave and never call and
Ill go to work and feel great for

her pace)

mouth

PARRY

known you for a long time I see you
come out of work every day I walk
with you to lunch I know what you
order I see you buy Baby Ruths
before going back in

(slowly removes his hand)
I know how you feel on certain days
by whether or not you go into the
bookstore

(Lydia listens with

fascination)

I know you hate your job and you
dont have many friends and you
sometimes feel like youre not as
as wonderful as everybody else and
youre a little uncoordinated

(Lydia begins to cry)

» and feeling like youre the only
one whos as separate and alone as
you are and I love you I love
you I think youre the greatest
thing since spice racks and I
would be knocked out several times if
I even got just a first kiss But
Ill be back in the morning And I
wont be distant And I will call if
you let me But I still dont drink
coffee

LYDIA
Shhh

She kisses him tentatively -- almost awkwardly Parry
feels a surge of emotion that makes his whole body
tremble Lydia separates from him and looks into his
eyes She pinches his cheek hard

LYDIA
(continuing earnestly)
You are real arent you

They kiss again Then Lydia quickly pulls away

LYDIA
(continuing)
You can call

She runs into the building afraid to linger and ruin the
moment Parry stands transfixed his eyes following her

Lydia pauses briefly to look back She is so excited
She smiles and turns toward the elevator her skirt
spinning with her

CUT TO

INT LYDIAS BUILDING - ELEVATOR - SECONDS LATER

She re-enacts the entire love scene in her mind to make
sure it went as well as she thinks

CUT TO

EXT LYDIAS BUILDING - NIGHT

PARRY is standing frozen We dont know whether hes
looking ahead of him or in his minds eye He appears
anxious and frightened as he steps back away from
Lydias building He senses someone is watching him
Parry smiles But suddenly it is as if everything has
gone into SLOW MOTION His eyes focus on her skirt as it
swirls around as she turns His expression grows dark
OS we hear a horses HOOVES moving in slowly as CAMERA

INT HOSPITAL WARD - NIGHT

PARRY lays in bed - his face bandaged his arms in a cast

his chest tightly rapped HE has been severly beaten JACK

and ANNE stand at the foot of the bed in shock A DOCTOR appears
The DOCTOR is young dedicated and inexperienced enough to

still feel compassion

JACK
Parry

DOCTOR
He cant hear you
(JACK and ANNE turn)
HiIm Dr Weintraub
(shakes hands)
I was on duty when they brought

him inIve been going over his record

He was brought in once before I understand
(reads)

--catatonic stuporcondition rendered

him non-verbal for a period of -

JACK
Yeah so The guys beat up - hehe
probably has a concussion or something right
(DOCTOR doesnt reply)
Hell snap out of it

DOCTOR
Im afraid not Then again Im not sure
The beatings bad but its not the problem
It seems hes re-experiencing the catatonia
So like before he could snap out it in an
hour or in thirteen months or thirteen years
I dont know Theres no way to tell

JACK
ButHow could that happen

DOCTOR
Well its not unusual in his case
Sometimes victims of tragedies are
subject to the brains replay system
The brain never loses anything - it just
stores it up and waits A person could
actually re-experience the full effect
of a tragedy long after the event took place
Are you relatives

(JACK shakes his head)
Well it doesnt matter Well take care
of it Hell have to be sent back to
the same institution

(HE checks the record)

JACK
What if I was a relative

DOCTOR
Youd have the option to care for him at
home but my advice is it wouldnt be the
best thing for him He needs hospital
care I just thought you could sign the
release forms but the city can do that
I wouldnt feel responsible in any way
Theres really nothing you can do Im sorry

With that the DOCTOR EXITS JACK and ANNE face PARRY

ANNE
Just like a guy Finds the woman of
his dreams then falls into a coma
Poor Lydia
(SHE looks at JACK)
Some women just have no luck huh

Including herself in this remark and having cried all she could
cry She and JACK exchange one final look SHE turns and
with all her dignity walks out of the ward After a BEAT

He stops in the entrance and looks at the deserted lot

Gone are the little cliques of homeless once scattered
throughout the place Gone is the magic and danger that
night cast upon the surroundings All Jack sees is

eyes and sees THE RED KNIGHT standing six feet tall as pictured
in the design of the stained glass window HE stares until

HE HEARS THE SOUND OF A HORSE GALLOPINGHE freezes then
cautiously looks toward the street - but the street

is vacant The galloping stops An eerie silence hangs in the air

up and quickly moves to the skylight He looks down into
it and sees a dark void He takes a breath and pulls out
some masking tape He makes three big tape loops and
applies them to the glass He then takes out a glass
cutter and begins to cut a pane The SOUND at first is
starting An 0OS VOICE says

VOICE
Youre being too loud

Jacks heart stops He looks into the darkness of the
roof but sees nothing He tries to slow down his heart
and shake away thoughts of demons in the dark He
continues cutting When he finishes the entire pane he
replaces the cutter in his pocket then plasters his arm
against the tape He gently bangs the pane and it comes
loose sticking to the tape He is impressed He places
the pane on the roof and fastening one end of the rope
to a pipe lowers the other end down

surroundings Jack pulls out the page from the

his way out

INT FIFTH FLOOR HALLWAY OF TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT

Jack looks down the dark hallway At the far end he can
see the top of a staircase He heads towards it until he
sees something that makes him stop dead in his tracks

Slowly a shadow holding a shotgun emerges up the stairs
against the back wall Jack is paralyzed He closes
his eyes The shadow reaches the top of the landing It
is EDWIN MALNICK Wearing the same expression we saw on
the TV broadcast -- sad and harmless Jacks heart is
bursting out of his chest Edwin calmly raises the gun
cocks it and FIRES the shot BLASTS down the hallway
deafening Jack But when he opens his eyes to see if he
has been hit there is no blood no wound and when he
looks up no Edwin He pulls himself together and
continues

chair which is turned facing the fireplace Jack spots

the antique commode and crosses to it Within the
commode sitting innocently behind two small glass doors
is the Grail Jack gently opens the doors and takes

out the goblet He holds it reverently for a moment
then noticing an inscription reads

TO LITTLE LANNIE CARMICHAEL

Jack cant help but smile He takes the chalice and
turns to leave when suddenly he notices

The bare foot of a man barely sticking out from in front
of the Chesterfield chair Jack slowly moves around the
large back of the chair to the front and sees to his
amazement LANGSTON CARMICHAEL wearing only his silk
pajama bottoms asleep in the chair On the table beside
him is an empty bottle of vodka and an empty bottle of
pills

Jack doesnt know what to do when it suddenly strikes
him that Carmichael hasnt moved at all At first he
thinks it is another hallucination but then he notices
the pill bottle He takes a step toward it the floor
SQUEAKING beneath him but Carmichael remaining
unconscious He reads the bottle Seconal Jack looks
at Carmichaels limp body and checks his heart It is
very faint Scared Jack slowly starts backing out of
the room

CUT TO

INT VIDEO POP - DAY

ANNE sits in her office a cigarette dangling from her mouth
going over receipts There is a knock at the door A beat of
silence ANNE raises her head to discover JACK holding a
bouquet of flowers HE smiles ANNE looks shocked then -
pulling herself togetherTHEY both are frozen in silence

ANNE
Well What do you want me to do -
applaud

JACK

How have you been

ANNE
(coldly)
Terrific Going on alot of dates
seeing lots of men lots of dates

JACK nods HE is uncharacteristically nervous

ANNE
(sincere vulnerable)

Im not up to this What are you doing here

HE takes a breath looks at ANNE and pushes the words out of him

JACK
I love you

For once ANNE is speechless She slowly rises from behind her
desk in such a way that JACK takes a step back in fear ANNE
up to him She has no intention of making this easy

ANNE
Excuse me I didnt get all that

Wont you run it by me again

JACK is dying HE could hardly say it the first time
JACK
I think (quickly corrects himself)
II realizedI love you

ANNE
Huh-huhYou son of a bitch

SHE hauls off and cracks him a slap across the face

that stuns him - his knees giving out lowering him to the floor
SHE quickly grabs his face with her hands and plants a passionate
kiss on his lips that slowly causes him to rise back up HE drops
the flowers and grabs her SHE mounts his body and begin to undo his
suit THEY go at it with such passion they both fall to the floor

ANNE (0C)
