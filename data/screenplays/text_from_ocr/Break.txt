Cop turning his face -gn Anthony coming out of the shadows
taking his cap off long white hair tumbles down from the

what happens to him not as unreality or dream but as
objects of fear Only later does this Fear fade into

Dream

Telephone voice off (soft)

Cool it man Keep it cool

Slow fade
21 This scene done in deadpan semi-documentary style
mostly medium and long shots Anthony treading lightly

into the subway no longer wearing raincoat but looking
more like a cat wrapped in a light beige wool overcoat
down to his knees with hood which he has over his head and
light-blue sunglasses over his eyes tan warm tight pants
and heavy warm moccasins Its about two in the morning
and the underground station is deserted save for a colored
cat well dressed in a silk scarf and wearing light-pink
shades over his eyes leaning up against a tier on the other
side of the tracks

Long shot of them across the tracks from one another

glancing through their shades at each other unconcerned
An utter silence A casually strolling back and forth
Advertisements on walls for soups intermixed with posters
of peoples facesblownup Brando Dean Sette Davis
Edward G Robinson etc Superman Batman Wonder Woman
A stops at Blowup of The Silver Surfer

Walks on Shot of him through colored cats
light pink lens across the tracks A reading a Poster
1 Believe That Love is the Greatest Thing
in The World that It Alone Can Overcome Hate That Right

Can and Will Triumph over Might --John D Rockefeller Jr

As A reads the poster a whistle down the tunnel
An express train whistles by shot of moving peoples
zombie faces shooting by in the night Express disappears
Utter silence returns whistle from down pedestrian
corridor Rich croesus-rockefeller type emerging dressed
in rich furs a red flower in his fur Hes old with grey
hair distinguished Walking back and forth near the

tracks a bit nervously but detached and rich

Puts pair of light yellow shades on looks at

A on his side of the track and the brother across
the track sees them both looking at him with their
variously colored shades (shot of them through his yellow-
shades) He takes them off Puts them away He doesnt
like them

shot of rich man pacing through A‘s blue shades

(if in black and white a frontal view of A looking is
good enough) and then through the brothers pink shades

Suddenly train whistles down tunnel coming down
As track Shot through As eyes Then brothers -Train
approaching screaming Shot through rich mans eyes
Nervously pacing at the very edge of the track Roar of
train Rich man jumping head on into the tracks Roar as
train goes by pulls to a stop Long shot A casually
getting into subway Pulls away Shot of brother left
alone on subway platform Watching the train pull out

Train through his pink shades Looking at the bloodied

eyes Greys can kill greys

writing with pencil on wall in large capitals

To Be Real

To Feel

FREE

(semi-documentary effect to this scene)
Camera dwells on Free

Cut to

27 Some stock footage outof the great fencing scene
in The Sea Hawk with Errol Flynn battling his adver-
sary in the castle their two huge silhouettes leaping up
on the stone wall behind them

Its effect camping the seriousness of Ag feelings perhaps
implying his own ability to see himself comically This
ability being what makes him go on and not give up the
difference between him and Alexander

Violin is still playing through this scene Footage is

cut at the moment Flynn kills his adversary

Violin continues

28 Camera panning a park discovering Man in the
Cold in the day not raining his head in his hands
looking at a small fire burning in a wired trash barrel
Dwells on hin

Voices off A dime mister

A If you need bread man steal it

(pause)

A (contd) Can I steal it from you
(pause)
Here take this key

(low mumbling follows and fades)

29 Shot of father in pusiness suit speaking

on telephone his arms gesturing angry disgusted Scene
done in silence except for violin which is still playing
Pan from fathers gesturing arm across to his
looted apartment drawers on floor food eaten in kitchen
liquor bottles open the mirrors stolen from their frames
Pan across his library full of rich leather bound
books left untouched Panning across this camera comes
to a young boy with long hair (Anthony) in a Cardin-type
suit playing the piano (the same child is seen later as
Anthonys own child) The off screen violin fading and
Anthony picking up the same gentle melody on the piano
Camera not stopping long at him keeps panning to his
young Mother much younger virginal in a long dress
reaching to her ankles as in the early 50s looking in
profile out the window at the garden an afternoon sun
shining
Voice off (soft a boys tiny voice)
The world is sorrow nothing more
and in its bosom I play the
practice of my heart

Camera panning out to the garden Dissolve very slow

30 off) There are no Truths outside the gates
of Eden

Shot unframed blowup of Dylan on wall Shot of
ALEXANDERS back on side looking at pester hating just
spoken this Turns around

I was what you are I am what youre
going to be

Alexander handsome all in voluptuous’ black walking
away from poster down a few steps into his apartment This
scene as well as the apartment are very important to the
theme of the movie Alexander being a throw-back to the
feelings expressed through Words through Poetry A blow up
Of Dylan in his apartment and a romantic unframed portrait of
Rimbaud the young French poet he identifies with Anthony
in the apartment with him is more modern more uncertain Of
his symbols (so far Genet Movie Actors Vogue and Glamour
Models being his only Blow ups he makes Alexanders trip here
in the Apartment and later again one last time in Prison
where Alexanders destiny is unfolded along with Anthonys
Two different roads but sprung from a similar source

Alexanders dark brooding clothes accentuate the
idea of a modern bewildered Hamlet lost in a sea of words in
a world where Words are dying

During the course of his monologues the camera Will
pass through his Apartment picking up objects such as his
two cats one striped one Siamese the paintings the blow-

ups of Comic-Book characters Alexander has but on his wall

a poster of Jim Morrison of the Doors and several large
plants (optional) -- and flowers The Apartments colors
could be plain white and black either black walls and
ceilings and bright white furnishings or vice-versa but a
stark contrast between two schemes old and modern Plastic
white chairs bubble tables with neons glowing on them
abstract portraits that of Rimbaud could be semi-abstract
red and green contrasted to this single classic furnishing --
Alexander -- all in black pacing through his large one-room
apartment studio a picture window looking out on the
dark city way below Also a fireplace above which hangs a
torch Not an Apartment stressing Wealth as Alexander is
beyond it almost mythic to Anthony

As written the cameras effect is to circle the
room time and again panning the objects as the spoken words
themselves encircle themselves

The Siamese sits in a white plastic chair looking
The striped cat is on the move

Alexander gliding past his objects finding a
cigarette lighting it standing Anthony is sitting across
from him in a chair dressed in a light motif -- contrasting
to Alexanders black Looking at Alexander Anthony in his
clothes looks like hets burned his last candle

Alexander looking at him understanding

(softly) Whats happened Anthony Tell
me

A pausing shrugging saying Oh like the French

say it Lighting cigarette Camera wandering away from him

His voice off soft almost an interior monologue
Strange things happen to me 1 feel like a
little boy inside a crazy crazy city trying to close a
window and the windows jammed (Pause) ese I keep
having accidents

Camera moving around room takes in another Anthony
sitting there in another outfit spilling champagne on
himself camera continuing past him as if nothing has happen-
ed Quick cut to A flicking the cigarette into his Mothers
wastebasket but before fire can erupt cut to sight pf auto-
mobile accident an anonymous body lying in the street
Cut to A‘s face close worried

I met a girl yesterday in the park
I was walking my Mothers dog

Shot of A in the park walking his Mothers little
dog Diana walking her Doberman The Doberman swarming over
As dog Diana berating her dog Leashing him in Talking
to A who holds the little dog in his arms A talking to
her Both talking

I didnt know it then but she was
the law

Shot of Diana her long white hair in the blue
policemans overcoat her voice off

You may attack me from the rear but You
will enter by the front

Fading into her freeze in bed the green scarf

clinging to her teeth by its edge draped on her bosom the

fear of release written in her eyes
so I was the thief (Genet Blew Up)
Anthonys explanations in contrast to Alexanders
are mostly made in images
I cop a cigarette case from her
Shot A leaving her apartment taking a gold cigar-
ette case
she sees me (D sees him) she
pretends she hasnt
Shot Diana acting as normal the dog still growling

at A soundlessly

says goodbye Says call me soon
knows I wont I stole Tm caught I dont return
(pause) she adores it I do what she wants shes
a thief doesnt know it (camera dwelling on Alexanders
portrait of Rimbaud) she paints she steals

Shot of full screen of Dianas painting of the
woman and the butterfly Shot A photograph similar to
Genets in a t-shirt looking sensitive and a thief Shot
A close talking blowing cigarette smoke out mouth

but she doesnt admit it stays a
COP loves like a cop

Shot Diana in bed freeze green scarf etc
fading into shot of red rose sitting in the toilet bowl
slow fade

Alexander But youre not a thief are you

Anthony looking up at Alexander (Pause)

Alexander Any others

A changing mood starting to smile
oh I met this crazy chick at an auto-

mobile wreck (shot of same wreck seen previously)

she takes me home to her place we talk shes incredi-
bly warm we go to bed then very suddenly ehe says

do you like to dominate or be dominated I say it doesnt
make any difference I dont think about it she says I
want to beat you okay she weighs about a hundred

pounds its passionless I feel foolish she says
man youre so square beat it beat what 44 get Out

of here she throws a boot at me (shot of boot hitting the
wall next to A)

Closeup As face

We just couldnt get together (pause)

(A reflecting) You walk around and you meet so many
squares you begin to think youre square then sometimes
you think just everybodys out of his head then yOu meet
the freaky obsessed ones like that chick snake people
cat people dog people (pause closeup A‘sS face)
and you just dont know where youre at

Alexander (a tender look) xo punish yourself

A Yeah thats just what this crazy chick
said Why do you punish yourself Thats what they always
say when you want to find something and youre looking very
hard Youll try anything (emphasizing it) anything just to
find out and if nothing is available you go out and force

yourself to look (shot A in street walking) and because YOU

force yourself these crazy people pin a label on it --
Masochist why do you punish yourself

Alexander (pause) So now what
A (shrugging shifting mood)

(Camera dwelling on Rimbaud shifting

to the Comics) -Im sick of sitting in movies theres
some kind of real war in the East they need menTI
need new faces Il enlist

Alexander and Anthony looking at each other A
going on almost in apology

eee the moneys good you keep what you

take you find out if you can kill if you cant
eos (pause) do you get killed (shrugs at his own morbid
thought)

Telephone rings Alexander picking it up A soft
feminine voice husky saying over the phone

Is Diana there

Alexander Shes gone
Is she coming back
Alexander No
This is Luna How are you Alex
Alexander looking at wall reflecting hesitant
about something The voice continues

Im going to the East I have a part ina
new movie of Goddards Ill be back Will you still be
here

Alexander looking puzzled

I dont know

Alexander hanging up pacing to front of abstract
lettering hanging on a canvas on the wall Able to be read
Painters paint Writers write Poets sing Killers kill (read
by camera going down from line to line)

Alexander turning away from tableaux asking A

Are you a killer who kills Anthony

(going on) You have never ever betrayed yourself to
Me «ss ever its sad that youre this way you insist

really on being your own hero in your own little tragedy

Shot As face His offscreen voice

The images begin Four quick images from Anthonys

mind tumble on screen each image running through his mind
with a click as from a slide viewer

1 A killing the anake with his knife (seen later)

2 A as sole survivor of massacre Shot from As
shoulder of desolate stream bed in the forest (seen later)

3 A being decorated in dark shadows In profile
A dark hand in a greta garbo glove putting an orchid on his
afghan-type uniform

4 The silver bird (airplane) flying across the
sky (seen later) Silver bird on airfield runway stopped
the door opening The hero returned Parents Alexander
Diana others there Four strong black brothers in furs
bearing a pink marble coffin strewn with yellow and black
flowers from the plane Shot of horror on Parents faces-
Alexander bowing his head tears on his cheek Diana looking

hard offended by this heroic act

Images end

Alexander I dont think you know yet whether

you want to live or die

Close shot As face Pause

A (becoming hard) I see before me with
my eyes I see a Siamese sitting pn a chair (camera follows
these objects he mentions) I see posters Of Dylan--Morrison
Superman people with secret identitie I see a library

full of exalted expectations -written by people whove been
eaten by worms I see a portrait of Rimbaud young
tender bold (camera dwelling on portrait) who after all
his travels and adventures was delivered back to the beginning
» into his mothers arms (bitterly) dying of syphilis
and I see one writer (camera directly on Alexander
humbling him beginning to reveal his identity) He
wrote a poetic book at the tender age of
eighteen Hes done nothing since Hes lived inside these
four walls for more than a year now writing to all hours dream-
ing thinking imagining having his women around him like little
insects and without knowing it himself becoming an ultra-
sensitive very tender plant

This wounds Alexander A long pause An interior
monologue delivered offscreen between the two of them in
urgent intimate whispers something they might have said to
each other before somewhere in the past

A (soft said quickly) when I die will
I see your face at the Gates of Eden Will you let me in

Alx I dont think Id let myself in

Camera which has been panning the room during this
short interior dialogue returns to Alx who is talking more
to himself in a wistful vein

We really live like plants though Its
the wordless part of ourselves where things just happen to
US eee were hard on our animal selves so hard and we travel
such a long way looking at Dylan blow Up “it’s so hard to
get on and so few so very few of us young ones ever
really make it (Turning to A After a long pause) Ive been
here tco long--- like yousay My mind is too loose my legs
Bre in stagnant waters Last nightI took my lasttrip I
asked my ingect womanto leave meShe did

Shot of A listening to Alxs conversational story
imagining it Alx on floor in lotus position Diana his
Diana painting Alxs face with long snaky luminescent’ colors

sprouting from the eyes the nose about the forehead Alx

looking very Indian very intense about to be brutal She
is finishing He stands looks in the mirror says something
to her looks at her tenderly She leaves

A « aS soon as she left I set my Poems

and my books everything on fire (shot of flames seen in
Scane 1) it was everything I had done is last year ees
but it made no difference I took a bag -- writing -- and
went to the end of it as far as 1 could go and you know
what I found I found nothing but myself All else had
fallen -- Truth Illusion whatever it is and The Dream had

very suddenly come down to an inescapable almost implacable

unmerciful factor factor-inanition One Me I like some
poor poet would say had punctured by beautiful beautiful
quintessence Quintessence is a lung Bang SSSSS

He hisses Walking to a flat table designed as
a chess board with the pieces on it all of them white Alx
picks up a castle in his hand rolling it over saying a bit

more gayly

Alx So I started playing a game of chess with
myself today (turns to A) it makes sense (Camera on
the all white chess pieces Alx replacing the castle) and

I shall play until Ive completely lost track of which piece
belongs to which of what belongs to what of who belongs to
who and then when the game is over (he pauses)

A Youll what

Camera on Superman Blow Up shifting to one of
Tarzan

Alx You know Anthony what the most beautiful
dream in the world is its the iris of a glistening green
serpent snowfloating on a film of mosspink water
its perforating pupil gazes at your naked back it slices
through the fluid brim it goes on and on fingers of the
dawn

A indifferent to any meaning Alexander attaches
to it

A I dont understand These are just words

Alx But words are thoughts Words fall out of

the sky like this rain They glide from street corner to

street corner » (Camera dwelling on cat the striped one
moving the Siamese looking at him the cats play a little
game as the monologue continues) thinking theres
always one more word one more thought nonetheless isnt
there Train of thought On the next corner On the last
corner I pass I go I passed it by What was it YOU
search You fail You wish perfection in the mind you
are close closer yesterday but one tomorrow but one so

close you are almost there Tomorrow It collapses and

where are you Thinking dimly thinking On and on through

a threnody of streets through words made of rain A
looking at the Rimbaud portrait)

Interior monologue Ahollow distant boys voice
Rimbauds about 16-17 speaking in a clipped almost docu-
mentary style Camera dwelling on painting of the poet

Voice off I wrote silences I wrote the night
I wrote the inexpressible I fixed frenzies in their flight
I purged my mind of all human hope 1 strangled joy I
pounced with the stealth of a wild beast 1 called to the
executioners I gnawed their rifle butts as I died

Oh the banner of raw meat against the
silk of seas and artic flowers Music veerings of chasms
and the clash of icicles against the stars (pause) I1 re-
turn with limbs of iron dark skin and furious eyes people
will think to look at me that I am of a strong race made-of
gold I will cover myself with gashes tattoo my body as

ugly as a Mongol youll see Ill howl through the streets

I will be raving mad and never work and never show my jewels

and one night (pause) the demon will seize me and embrace
me and we will wrestle on the floor and one night I will lose
and come to regard as sacred the disorder of my mind

Shot of Anthonys face closer up closer his face
dissolving into the trees blowing in the forest right after
the explosion (seen later)

Shot of Alexander looking out the window down at
the city Goes on talking As he talks camera casually
panning Anthony as he rises puts his coat on and leaves
to go back outside (to the street) which calls He has be-
come really just another object in the apartment Alexander
accepts his leaving without saying anything His back is
turned He is speaking as if to himself The camera alter-
nating between the Apartment and the rainy street Anthony is
walking down

Alexander (his voice off) Last night I was alone

at the musicend of death staring flatfaced into a
pond the sea the ghosts of the lungs the promise of
things to be A bony damp cavern where women grow like
seaweed from the sea they owl iboo iboo cry in the night
her hand like an edge on my isolated shoulder -- so sweet as
I rest in her breath in her breast my head on her shoulder
and weep Weep Weep (shot of Comic Book Blow Up fading to
shot of Anthony chasing Joanna through the woods seen later)

the fingers of the dawn they weep all is seen through

an eyeccave of bonepillars that redound percussive eee

porous stumbling towards spectrum slipping on
sound eating air I tell myself reminding myself it
is wet in my shell in my strong strong shell it is wet and
0 now I feel I feel the days melting into years and light-
years liquidating the years and time itself crumbling
through the lungs the ghosts sing their songs carry into the
air air atmmsphere air all about (shot Alxs face quick
Cut to A emerging in the street sniffing gratefully the wet
air) air air fixed and silent how silent long
silences inhabit this air the drip drop of it in my ear in
the air perched sounds tediums sweat like the movies a
forgetive imago in black and white and chevied with chiaro-
scuro and in the zoo it takes two days to say Yes Yes --
the only word that matters in the language its in Eden

Yes

A walking down a street hooded with construction
timber the walls in blue Om the wall painted in red are
the words Freedom for Greece

Alx (concluding) Out on the ocean (slow shot
of ocean late just before the sunset) when it is green and
desolate and cold and the big waves come up (slow shot of
waves rising and falling) out of the emotion Seagreen blue
water Thrashing on the skull I dip my face inwards
(Camera panning to an anonymous youth floating by himself in
the water) and float my starved eyes on the wide window of
the sea And lull my eyesockets to a wide-eyed sleep

strange sample of the sea transfusing the spark of ingenuity

(shifting asking) there is no ingenuity in the sea is there
I wonder what sharks are poised between here and there
what fish lie lonely under the waves
Shot A walking back to the camera Cut to Alx
looking in a mirror puzzled perhaps realizing A has left

and he is alone his words are much slower now

A face is a face nothing more
The end of Truth is this face (pleading his voice
off) flee the fugitive dream it glistens in the moon

it dances on slithery serpents (shot of slithering snake in
the Temple (seenlater) by rushing waterfalls (Shot
the stream in the forest seen later) Squeezed inwards by

flesh- fed pythons that coil slimes of eternity about my eyes

(Shot Anthony being bitten by the snake seen later) and

forgive forget free to finish my hope fo die to

be me nomore Dead (both question and exclamation)
Shot Francis at the stream dying seen later

Cut to Alexanders sad face Alexander approaching the end

which is played out later in Prison

Anthony on the street these words following him
leans up against the blue fence Hes tired exhausted worn
out His offscreen voice whispering fighting off the
desire to give it all up

Words just Words wrapped around

Dissolve

Forest » Stream Temple

Time and place and worlds have changed The City
has been unreal frightening Here a much more relaxed
primitive world -- that of snakes slow quiet but suddenly
very fast very violent and very dangerous Anthony moves
from the Fear of the Cat into the Dream of the Snake He
will be bitten by it and he will kill it And never for-
getting it will journey on into the final deep-sea world
of silence Then Freedom

A has gone to the East to fight with the mercenary
soldiers against the wild tribes of the Forest Hes part
of a small detachment of fifteen-twenty men resting deep
in the jungle-forest of a small old abandoned Buddhist
temple The relics are broken the statues on the floor

mixed with the mercenaries light individual equipment --

rifles small knapsacks grenade belts In this temple
Buddha still stands some stray unknown forest people still
coming to worship here There are fresh joss sticks burn-
ing Several mercenaries mostly black in their early
twenties are inside the temple sprawled on the floor on
their ponchos a small fire going One is sleeping
another reheating a piece of meat they have killed a wild
deer and his half-eaten corpse is still slowly roasting on
a stick built over the fire Several of the blacks are
smoking the Forest Hash which they are passing aound in
two pipes which are very long and beautiful They wear an
individual mixture of uniforms although their pants are all
the same -- light tight-fitting breeches If they wear
shirts -- several are bare-chested with medallions (Bud-
dhist Christian sharks tooth other designs) and tattoos
-- the shirts are loose some of them ruffled and mixing
with the camouflage of the jungle -- green and tan gold
black and white striped etc Some wear head bands around
their long hair silver bracelets beads one wears sun-
glasses another brother with a thin hawklike nose wears
a black bandanna tightly wrapped on his head as if like
the other brothers he was just off the city block taking
a trip in the Jungle This is to bekept in mind for the
Fate that befalls this outfit results from the fact that
they are not really part of The Forest They are in
spite of their disguises from The City Very few of them

will be able to survive the primitive ordeal of this world

Though the outfit has been several weeks in the Forest
the blacks have no beards A small transistor radio plays
inside the Temple and two of the Brothers are dancing
softly to the sound of soul music

The white world is for the most part outside the
Temple sprawled about it in the thick grass relaxing
Some have beards others have shaved but their faces are
hard and dirty dust and dirt is deeply ingrained in the
eracks of skin Anthony is an exception he has kept him-
self clean his beard barely visible although there are
small lines of fatigue under his eyes and a small scar
under his left eye the result of a previous wound not
serious He tends to rub it occasionally Ironically in
the war he has become even softer Time has crumbled
he is spacing himself

The contrast is made then by camera closeups
of the black and white features The Blacks are tenderer
softer The Whites are tired cruel The blacks Sing-
Dance Although inside they are as blue as the sky and

scared

Opening Shot (set to Music contrasting to the

World of Words Anthony has just left behind in the City

31 A black soldier with rifle and grenades but hat-
less like all the rest is striding through thick elephant
grass and thicket the camera with him as he walks catch-

ing the effect of the green elephant grass splitting apart

as he walks the sun gleaming through the trees almost
moving with him seen and then not seen and seen again
From a distance inside the temple on the radio Sam
Cookes song Cupid is playing loud and sort of sad like
all Cookes songs giving a texture of music and sunlight
to his walk

He breaks through the thicket into the crystal
clear sun shining over the tiny clearing around the
Temple The Whites sprawled about

As he breaks through the thicket Anthony wear-
ing silver bracelets and a Buddhist medallion around his
neck and a ruffled dirty shirt his hair unkempt longer
than before is taking his picture from a distance through
a telephoto-lensed camera which for the first time he
carries with him Radio still playing Cupid A snap-
ping the shutter again Photographic freeze of Robinson
(the soldier) Music and Anthonys first use of his eyes
are themes inherent to The Forest

Camera on A as he moves about the clearing
taking pictures of the White soldiers Their photographic
freezes Introducing their hard faces

A shooting Lee who is at the head of the out-
fit (later described)

A shooting Bunny the youngest soldier who is
handsome and tender looking though later his actions
describe him as stupid and cruel

A pausing walking a little bit further away

from the temple

« A approaching from a distance Isaac a moder-
ately tall slender muscled Indian with sharp attractive
features no beard whatever his long black hair curling
down over his forehead could look like a little boy but
he stands there away from the rest sharpening his long
glistening hunting knife His chest is without hair and
he wears a thin loose-fitting vest of black cloth hanging
unbuttoned from his broad shoulders The way he sharpens
his knife with stone and cloth it is obvious this is his
most important possession

A raising the camera to his eye to take his
picture Through the lens a sees Isaac raise his head
as he feels the camera on him Looks at camera Shakes

his head Turns away from the camera-

32 A walking back into the Temple after his trip
into the white world the scene in the Temple as described
previously Two Brothers dancing to the music- He
stops at the threshold of sunlight thinks about’ taking
a picture but knows he cant this world in here cannot
be photographed He goes and sits by Francis a brother
who is very close to Anthony Hehas tender features-

A listening smoking the bowls as they come
around from both directions They are all feeling Very

nice On the radio Smokey Robinsons Tracks of My Tears

is playing and as the two brothers dance Francis who
has a very high singing voice though not as good as
Smokeys whom most people mistake for a woman he sings so
‘tenderly starts to sing with the radio

People say Im the life of the party
cause I tell a joke or two

Although I may be able to laugh loud and hardy
deep inside Im blue

So take a good look at my face

Youll see my smile looks out of place
If you look closer
Its easy to trace
The tracks of my Tears
I need you Need you
Since you left me if youve seen me with
another girl
Seeming like Im having fun
although she may be cute
Shes just a substitute
because youre the permanent one
So take a good look at my face
Youll see my smile looks out of place
Look a little bit closer
Its easy to trace the Tracks of My Tears
etc
As Francis sings his song his brand of blues the camera

closes on him in the backdrop Buddha sits

As he sings the rest do not look at him sing
they know he can sing theyve heard this song a hundred
times they know it too They lie where they are look at
what they do and deep inside where its blue they listen

The two brothers on their feet dance slowly a
fewgestures with their hands about shoulder level and
their feet moving in a tiny circle of tenderness

The pipes continue to circulate Francis even
interrupting his singing momentarily to smoke hold ex-
hale and then sing again He is not performing he is
just singing along The smoking of the Hash naturally has
some relationship to the surrounding dream world of The
Forest but isnt really significant and like the singing
is very casual going almost unnoticed by the camera

The song ends

33 Camera dwells on Buddha at peace another long
afternoon in The Forest drifting by The camera moving to
Adams who is very high off by himself in a corner of the
temple He is one of the whites wandering through his
head his low interior monologue The monologues here
are done swiftly voices following quickly on other voices
Adams off) Theres no entertainment out

in a beautiful world where things dont make any dif-

ference It will take them a long time to come where I am

friends To King who is the biggest brother very black
with big white cotton pickers nails His large pink hand-
some tongue as he says

Adams The King has a pink tongue 4 He says

told me when I asked him why he took alithese pictures he

wasteland is beautiful thats what makes him crazy

get killed though he got grazed below the eye we
thought he was dead somebody somewhere looks out for

him 6s me Id never used my ears before I came to the
forest Id like to write when I get out Id like to
write down what hear First Id go back and get some
schooling and catch up on my spelling therere a lot
of questions I have but theyll probably never get answered
like how high is the sky how many flies there are in
the world how do they know people dont live in the
stars

As Adams is wandering around in his head camera
moves from A to Jeremiah (called Rhah) who is strutting
up very confidently his walk snake-like all waves une-
dulating He looks older than the rest his Origins seem
obscure probably from the South He speaks with a slight

Southern twang Hes white

34 Rhah arriving standing above the relaxing group
looking them over a slight malicious smile on his face
Francis looking up smiling
Whats happening Rhah
Rhah pausing fixing the whole circle in his

eye settling on Buddha for his address smiling

Rhah iim whats happening and if you dont
dig me Your shit is hanging in the wind that gentleman
is what I say Baaaaaa (he delivers this last like a
growl a neigh implying I am what I am)

Lerner the only other white with Anthony and
Adams in the Temple a Jewish looking boy from the City
young and freaky with curly hair thin (he was the boy at
the elevator in scene 3) looks back at Rhah his tongue
hanging out like an alcoholic grotesquerie

And Baaaaaaaa back on you (delivers it
with all the contempt and venom he can shaking his head
a stuporific look in his eye making a grotesquerie out Of
what Rhah delivered with a certain style)

Rhah looking at Lerner hard with distaste

Rhah If youre going to do it do it right
(Rhah winds himself up and with a dramatic downsweep of his
fist at the same time taking a step with his foot de-
livers a huge convincing Baaaaaaaaaa his head shaking
staring wide-eyed at Lerner)

Draws himself up The group laughing Rhah
smiling and proud of himself

Laughing dies

Lerner looking at Rhah with half-closed eyes

I didnt like it

Rhah coming right back
Screw yourself Youre a child I

dont waste time talking to a child

Lerner taking his head into his hands shaking
his hair pretending to weep
Im a child Ima child
Rhah looking away in disgust Shot of A looking
Francis to Lerner

Wow man dont take it so bad
Lerner raising his head

Oh it doesnt bother me what Rhah says
He cant even begin to bother me you see I know what he
is and (his eyes looking at Rhah malicious and gleaming
like he was going out of his head too here in The Forest)
hes just a tangled up screwed up scared up little man oe
getting old

Pause Rhah his back to Lerner getting annoyed
turning back on him suddenly serious

Dig it Imold Im little And Im
scared and I done the crimes of stealing and killing If

Army I been to Africa China Vietnam and countries You
never heard I been a cook 1 been a truck driver a

bows his eyes closed almost ready to crash) we been the

at the floor bored) And dig it baby I got silver stars
bronze stars croix de guerres all kinds of silver and
maybe a hundred and sixty stitches says I made the scene
(Stopping) Whatch you got (Shot A looking up at
Rhahs face forced to pay his respects because Rhah is
really telling the Truth) Rhah going on concluding draw-
ing himself back up more humorously

So put it this way if I want to
pretend Im Superman 1 willif 1 want to let my hair grow
as long as Thors I will and if anybody points his little
pink finger at me I1 be in his shit so fast hell think
speed was going out of style hell be hanging out there
in the wind wondering (Rhah wagging his head) Whg was
that That was Rhah

pause

Lerner head bowed saying Whew

Anthony has listened

On the radio which had temporarily broken down

during Rhahs appearance starts up again Manny playing

with it As when Francis was singing most of the brothers
have not seemed to listen to Rhah make his scene They
hear but they dont look as if their ears eyes and mind
were all separate senses

Manny toying with the radio gets it playing
again but some crazy station and Lili Marlene is being
sung by Marlene Dietrich about ten seconds before Manny
slightly embarrassed behind his black shades turns to
the soul station saying

ww thats some old time sides theyre
throwing at us

Rhah has seated himself Ig smoking like an old

bull

35 Outside Commotion Camera moving to the
windowless sunlight hole on the side of the temple (several
such holes around the walls about 3 by 4 feet) Shot
through this frame of some whites chasing around Cries
Get the snake Food etc

Camera outside closer shot of a large yellow
black and red snake moving very fast over the ground
fluttering white hands trying to catch it The snake moves
with great twists of its body making you wonder how it can
move so fast Knowing these hands are Death Camera
dwelling on this snake moving at about five miles an
hour sliding through over under but unable to get Out

of the large circle the whites have made around it We

almost sympathize with the poor snake fighting wildly
Suddenly it breaks through the circle and they are running
after it again They cannot catch it but the powerful
snake making one mistake and unable to pick out Isaac
the Indian who is standing perfectly still watching
slithers unknowingly through Isaacs spread silent legs

We havent seen Isaac yet First shot of his
legs and the snake sliding through His hand speeding
down andpinning it by the neck Tilt up medium shot to
his face as he scoops it up A grimace of pleasure on his
face snake dangling by its neck its tongue flickering
helplessly Isaac hisses at it Lets it dangle Sees it
is non-poisonous Stops hissing Wraps it around his
wrist on the other wrist coincidentally he has a replica
of a snake done in silver smaller three or four coils
wrapped around his wrist The snake crawls up his arm
towards his neck This scene with Isaac and the snake is
shot fairly fast not too dramatically

Long shot of Isaac and snake through the Temples
sunlight hole A focusing his telephoto lens- Taking a
picture Freeze of picture

Isaac seeing A take the picture (close shot of
Isaacs eyes) a virile smile on his face and woxdlessly
because it is his snake walking out of the small throng
of whites who are around him admiring the snake
walking in his soft tread towards the temple the snake

now wrapped around his neck (by now it should be obvious

that it is not poisonous) its tongue and head swaying over

Isaacs chest On his bicep Isaac has a small graceful

tatoo Born To Kill
Long shot of him approaching Temple

Francis (off) Crazy people dig snakes crazy

people

A Violence is like snakes

We hear the snap of his shutter as he takes
another picture of Isaac approaching very quick eo

very unexpected ee Click

Quick freeze of snakes head swaying

Side shot of Isaac moving from the waist up

The camera zooming out slowly on Isaac till it
brings Francis and Anthony into view looking through the
sunlight hole at the moving Isaac

Francis (off at first) He scares me man hes
wild crazy in the head He plays his knife like she was
a woman

A (taking another picture) He moves nice
man ge its funny its tender its soft s it’s SO all
alone

Shot out to front of what they see Nothing
Isaac has already glided in around them in the wackdoor

of their Temple

36 As the camera is focused out through the light

hole there is a slight rustling behind them the sound a

snake makes when it sways They turn swiftly Frontal
shot of Isaac standing right behind them the snake wrapped
around his arm its head swaying out in front of Francis
Francis doesnt move but his face muscles tighten and his
eyes dilate a little

Francis Dont fool with me man dont fool
with me

Isaac smiling Behind him still sprawled
around the radio Flaying are the brothers and Rhah and
Lerner and Adams but things are quieter and without look-

ing they listen

Anthony is also repulsed by the snake Isaac
sees this Smiling a bit says slowly

Isaac You been staying a long time in the
shade Anthony you fixing to get a tan Like his

nodding at Francis) or red like mine (he smiles)

Isaac coiling the snake in the cup of his hand
Offering it up to A

A hesitating a moment putting the camera away
looking at Isaac takes the snake not looking at it as
its wet living body winds through the fingers of his hands
Isaac smiling A looking directly at him The snake
winding up Anthonys arm A look of comprehensim and re-
laxation coming into his face Isaac sees it

Isaac Its alive isnt it

Anthony nodding taking the snake in his hands

passing him around his neck his waist beginning to feel

a tremendous joy in this living wet damp creature his
fear of it disappearing The snake responding beginning
to calm down on Anthonysbody At this point Isaac says
Give it to me

Anthony hesitating Attracted by the power in
Isaacs eyes

He gives the snake back Isaac cups it in his
palm

Isaac (to Anthony) Come

They go down together down the three steps
which separate the raised floor around the inner wall of
the Temple from the worshipping floor Isaac leads Anthony
up to the Buddha

As they walk we pick up from the radio the
hollow voice of Sam Cooke again singing Lets Twist The
Night Away -- almost a four oclock in the afternoon
voice at the dead end of the day this accent on Twist
Twist Twisting the Night Away

Buddha has many arms Isaac places the snake on
one of these arms Anthony to his side watching The
snake in the arms of this new almost golden object
starts glistening and sliding wildly through its many arms
Isaac drawing his long hunting knife with his riyht hand
from his left hip his features dedicated as a priest
before the blood-letting

Isaac (not looking at A) We sacrifice

Quickly he pins the snakes speeding head with

his left hand and without hesitating violently slices its
head off a cruel look of brutality on his face

With his left hand Isaac whips the snakes
dripping head in the air as if it were a scalp His arm
is quivering His head is down the gesture not being
that solemn but more spontaneous quick contemporary
the gesture has already faded he pulls in his arm Puts
the head to his lips Drinks

Turns to A Offers him the head A looking
at Isaac powerfully attracted by the look of strength in
Isaacs eyes Takes the snake head Drinks

Tastes the blood in his mouth It goes down
strong A smear of it on his lips making them corral-
colored Close shot of his lips Close shot of Isaacs
wide strong mouth

A shot a single rifle shot is heard from out-

side

Its echo dies

Anthony and Isaac havent moved They look at
each other Isaacs eyes alight with anticipation at the

rifle shot the call of danger Anthonys eyes completely
lost in Isaacs animal eyes feeling a powerful attraction
to this almost human fire

Shot of fire Scene 1

Shot close of Isaacs face Anthony under-
standing the fire is in people and between them

The rifle shot is repeated The other soldiers

are hurrying out of the temple now not having been
alarmed by the first shot The radio going with them

Shot of Isaac and Anthony standing in front of
Buddha

Solitary shot of the rifle that fired being
raised by an arm into the air Resting in the sky flat
in Indian style A cry is heard (Explained later the
cry is Freedom but in a strange language)

37 The screen is in blackness for several seconds
Then a chant begins in the blackness a Dionysian chant

(example taken from Dionysos in

The chant is repetitive accompanied by a tam
bourine but in this repetitiveness in this lack of desire
to search for new interpretations there is a real feeling

for love which is really a source without words

The screen slowly comes to light and we see a
young tribe maybe a dozen dancing freely in the forest by
a stream Perhaps they are the enemy it is not made clear
yet They are a mixture of young men and women and their
children white and black They dance hugging each other
their long hair jumping in all sorts of love contortions
that display their freedom They are all in love with each
other with their god with the forest And easy as it is
to make fun or laugh at this scene at first must be done
with the camera truly involved in their spirit of joy and

freedom

Some are blondes some black haired The hair
long the players young and contemporary looking and above
all to preserve the spirit of the scene they must move
well in some sort of time to the tambourine throwing
their bodies into it Ideally they are naked and some
of them body painted But barring that they wear filmsy
primitive tribal threads hand made of beautiful colors
exposing their handsome bodies A few wear colorful head-
bands all of them some kind of ornament -- bracelets
beads native jewels clasps etc The colored tribesmen
do not exactly wear the same clothes as I think they would
look sort of silly Their threads suit them and nobody
else and there is no need to establish any equality
similarity as far as clothes go saying that Freedom has
no respect for clothes If theyre not naked then let them

look beautiful with their own motif in mind What they

want to be is left up to them In his mind the writer
forms the image of the black panther -- a sort of ineradic-
able wariness at the root of their Freedom unlike the
White who when he loses his mind really proceeds to lose
it and to embrace the new Whether the blacks actually
dance is left up to them They could be sentinels in the
woods they could be on the stream watching the others do

their dance

38 Camera panning up slope from the tribe into the
woods Their singing carrying with the camera Long shot
of soldiers moving slowly in single file through the woods
in the same combination of clothes as at the Temple carry-
ing rifles small knapsacks on their backs hatless
Moving cautiously

Camera zooming slowly into the point man who is
Bunny the youngest one set out to prove hes as good as
any man his features assuming a distorted hardness
Camera now encompassing Lee who is second in the file
carrying a map in his hand a young sergeant He is small
with a heavily repaired face indicated by the seam of scar
tissue running from his ear along his jaw to his chin He
wears a red bandanna around his neck

Bunny still in the cameras eye turning back
to Lee as he hears the sound of the music Lee gives him
a tight look squinting he frequently squints nervously

assuring himself of which part of his face is really his

Comes up on Bunny Puts binoculars over his
eyes Do not know what he sees Brings binoculars down
Looks at his map Is puzzled Squints Turns around
Motions to the men with his arm to sweep out downslope
slowly Finger to his lips to indicate silence although
the men know what they are doing anyway and can hardly see
his gestures

The men disappearing in the forest Frontal shot
of them inching down the slope to the stream Then side
view of them approaching Music growing louder fThere are
no sentinels around oddly

They approach the stream and quietly crouch down
behind rocks trees dead logs Take off their knapsacks
What they see at first does not really excite them they
are much too wary and as a group have up to now functioned
as soldiers

Shot of As face A moving up further very
interested They have been watching for a while and un-
controllably they start inching further up Francis and
another brother joining A from different sides They pass
each other a puzzled look Anthony putting his rifle and
knapsack down taking his camera out and shooting the
tribesmen

Shots of Adams Lerner Others

39 Shot of Lee his tight body on the ground his

binoculars to his eyes propped on his elbows looking

Puts the binoculars down Picks his rifle up puts it to
his shoulder his eye squinting medium to close shot he
is an expert marksman his legs loosely spread and the
stock of his rifle deeply imbedded in the shoulder the
rifle slightly twisted inward his rear elbow coming up
off the ground as he sights in for a little man he
shoots high off the body very confident very precise

Camera dwells on him as he is about to shoot
But he hears footsteps behind him Takes his eye from the
stock squinting not looking around The footsteps
gettingcloser Shot of the feet next to Lee On the feet
aremoccasins they are Isaacs Lee looking up at Isaac
who has a small French submachine gun cradled in his arms
and is looking down at the stream bed Isaac giving Lee
a look and proceeding down to the stream his action fore-

stalling amassacre Lee with hate in his eye staring at

Isaacsback Hesquints
40 As Isaac walks down to the stream in the open
a female in the tribe sees him The tambourine stops

They stop dancing Shot of one of the tribes blacks
standing up from where he was watching and warily looking
at Isaac who walks on down to the stream Proud but
puzzled for the first time in his life He stops a little
dis tance away

The leader of the small roving tribe no older

than his early thirties calls to him

Peace and Joy (Making with his hand
a small sincere gesture something like this On the word
Peace showing the back of his hand Joy the front of
his hand implying an empty hand stretching it saying)

Join us

Isaac pausing puzzled

Who are you What tribe

The leader smiling turning around to give the
sign for more singing dancing

Join us Find out

The tambourine resumes playing and the tribes’
people resume their dancing and singing as if nothing has
happened The few blacks are still wary but the whites
fall to it and soon are becoming more intense than ever
perhaps thrilled that they are dancing the Passion Dance

in the eyes of the cobra with the gun They carry no

weapons

41 Shots of individual soldiers seeing what has
passed They start creeping slowly down to the stream
Spreading out on the logs and rocks watching Isaac puts

his weapon away and sits watching by himself The blacks
in the tribe have become more wary seeing these other
soldiers but they cool it although they rightly feel
theres going to be trouble Lee remains up in the wood
Bunny is the last to leave him The black soldiers more

or less assemble together on a huge fallen log and watch

Anthony with them The other whites more thinly spread
A shot of Rhah looking

The dancers growing increasingly erotic their
limbs interlaced men on the ground women passing their
bodies closely over them feeling everywhere with their
hands Shots of the soldiers faces growing more and more
desirous Isaac perhaps feeling this desire wanting
suddenly to be alone and think retreats into the woods by
himself without a rifle pensive looking His disappear-
ance is fatal as he was the only force that could have
prevented what occurs The dancers writhe Suddenly
with a yell Lerner rips off most of his clothes and jumps
in with them and starts to writhe and join in the spirit of
freedom The tribe accepts him but with no display He
mixes well Ha belongs but his action only agitates
further the other white soldiers

Shot Rhahs face A hatred for Lerners fool-
ishness on it Shakes his head slightly saying quietly

You child You fool

The dancers almost copulating to the music Not
even singing anymore

Shot one of the males on his knees his head
buried in a womans belly her arms around his head
writhing against his head

cut

42 Bunny heaving the same girl up on his chest

huggingher She is so far gone into the ecstasy she
doesnt notice really who it is He grins madly and
starts making off into the woods with her The other
whites with shouts following him hugging the women like
satyrs at the rape kicking the almost unconscious help-
less men away with their boots some knocking them away
with their rifles ferner fighting for the women but
being knocked aside The women begin to realize what is
happening and start struggling A few screams One
heavily bearded white chasing a girl no more than sixteen
into the stream thrashing with her Rhah wading out to
help her struggling with the big soldier who throws him
off Shot of Lee in the woods raising his rifle and
expertly firing into the water around Rhah warning him
off Rhah looking wildly up into the woods A black
tribesman jumping on him They scramble in the water

Shot of Lee putting the rifle away
looking down at the chaos pleased He squints Doesnt
move

Shot of Isaac deep in the woods hearing the
shots Turning around slowly his face muscles hard but
his eyes already resigned to what has happened He doesnt
move

Shot of the Rape from behind the brothers who
are still on the log watching Anthony is no longer there
Camera moving to their side shooting them in profile

watching resigned indifferent

Robinson the soldier who was coming through the
bush at the beginning to the sound of Cupid rises
I might as well cut myself a piece too

He looks back They look at him One starts

eating the food he has carried Robinson shrugs moves
off
43 Cut to Anthony Hes way out in the woods on

the far bank of the stream opposite his companions with
his rifle looking intently for something he has seen The
music is still playing in the distance but fades as he
runs after Joanna He is not aware of what will happen
at the stream It is before Runny began the Rape which
will be simultaneous with his

Cut to Joanna leaning her hands behind her up
against a tree Her naked body painted green like a snake
Her face as well Her hair is blonde She is a stunning
sight

Anthony at last finds her approaches hesitantly
looking at her as if she were unbelievable but naturally
drawn to her primitiveness He stops puts his fifle down
takes his magazine belt off not taking his eyes from her

A snake is hanging from the tree above her head
A long pause

Joanna Youre not scared of snakes are You

Anthony No not any more

Je Youre not scared of me are you

A (hesitating) No

She smiles

Camera on Anthony as Joanna says

Joanna Take your clothes off then

The snake in the tree rustles Anthony takes
his clothes off Stands there naked in front of her

Joanna Who are you

Anthony (hesitating) Anthony

J O 4 Anthony

Here she either takes the snake down off the
tree and she wraps it around her neck its head swaying
over her breast or more easily done puts her hand up
into the tree and the snake glides around her hand and arm
or she just simply slides off the tree saying

Joanna I am called Joanna but Anthony
(looking at him smilingly with her eyes and shaking her
head) will never have Joanna because he is scared of her
and he will never catch her (she laughs and starts
moving away)

Anthony watching her Snake rustles and dry
bird calls out of the trees The distant sound of the
tambourine Anthony who has never really pursued before
begins to follow her The bird calls increase He hears
the dry dangerous clicking rustle of snakes which seem to
inhabit the forest He walks faster She walks faster
not bothering to look over her shoulder They move from

tree to tree both naked in the green forest The chase

begins a long sequence Their movement is deeper into
the forest away from the fast-fading music They increase
their speed until they are running as fast as they can
through the trees Joanna is as swift as a deer and al-
ways seems to elude Anthony who is also very swift But
rather than lose him she hides and he finds her or she
lets him see her and the chase begins again the only
sound their speeding naked feet on the forest floor- As
Anthony runs he sees the snakes in the trees and at their
foot and in his path too but the chase has made a young
savage out of him and he runs by these hissing snakes
without thought or concern Just to take her like his
companions are taking back at the stream

The chase is long We catches her at the base
of a tree perhaps the same tree where they began the
same snake hissing in the tree They entwine taking long
deep breaths (shot in slow motion) they are falling togeth-
er onto the forest floor their eyes closed Anthony SO
happy so out of breath his breathing her breathing his
low animal moan the only sound now in the forest (Shot
as they fall together of a snake biting Anthony in the
arm (seen later) is shot in slow motion so that it
melts into their fall also in slow motion possibly a
superimposed image) The camera on them as they writhe in
each others grasp like two snakes feeling touching in
the wild freedom seen at the dance all over each other

Anthonys face in close up a picture of pleasure and pain

and breaking through that to freedom a great expressive-
ness in both their faces The camera leaving them alone
panning slowly back to the stream passing the trees the
snakes The pan dissolving putting the screen in dark-
ness Slowly reluctantly we come back to The Rape at

the stream

44 The screen still in darkness Bunnys boyish
angry voice off
Whats the matter do I smell bad Am
I dirty Am I ugly (Sound of hitting her) Hunh Dont
you people believe in sex or do you just dance hunh
(hits her)
Her voiceYou coudin’t understand You people
could never understand
Bunny What do I got to understand Hunh
(hits her)
How to feel shescreams very loud
like a bird dying
He hits her again and again The dull monotonous

echo of slaughter on the black screen The echo fading-

45 On the screen a shot of the girl lying beaten
to death draped on a broken tree limb a shot emphasizing

horror She is already very white and looking stuffed

She is the same girl seen earlier in the motorcycle suit

looking at Rodins The Kiss Fossibly a silent shot Of

this previous scene cut short Camera dwells on this

deadgirl

46 Cut Anthony springing on Bunny Trying to kill
Bunny But it’san even match and they go on fighting use-
lessly andcamera losing interest in them pans to tribe
people running off into the woods on the other side of the
streamlike fauns Some soldiers are standing around the
deadgirl some of them amazed that the rape should end in
murder Anthony and Bunny both exhausted are struggling
off to the side out of breath The Leader of the Tribe
striding up to the girl picking her up she dangles wax
white in his strong arms a lifeless puppet He speaks to
thesoldiers clearly slowly

All of you will pay for this black as

well as white (shouts) you are animals you are beasts

47 Cut to Leader moving away in the rain across the
stream from them the girl lifeless in his arms moving up
the other slope (it has begun to rain but we did not see it
begin it is already in progress in this shot the rain
will continue till the very last scene in the Forest when
it suddenly breaks) On the opposite bank Joanna (clothed
now) waits at the woodline for the Leader in the same pose
of waiting that she useslater when she waits for Isaac at
the edge of another woodline overlooking this same stream
Anthony ceases to struggle with the exhausted Bunny and on
his knees dirt all over his face he looks up and sees her

She sees him Then vanishes in the wood following The

Leader Anthony still looking after her
Shot Anthony running through the woods after
Joanna
Shot Anthony entwining and falling on the floor
of the forest with Joanna The camera doing the same Pan
as before across the trees back to the stream

His voice Youll have our child

Her Ill have the child of many fathers
Pause
Him I1l go
Her Yes Goand Kill
Him I11 come back
Her No
48 The camera pans right into the rain as it heads

downstream (the above voices do not begin until the camera
is into the rain) and picks the mercenaries up later on
their march Long shot through the woods of them walking
right down the stream itself which comes up around their
knees The bush on both sides of the stream is now too
thick to walk through They are walking in a staggered
double file one on the right side of the stream another
further back on the left another further back on the
right etc Occasionally cracké of thunder come out Of

thesky The rain grows worse Cries of the deepening

forest

49 The men are soaking wet Lee at the front with

Bunny motions for them to take a break They squat on
the rocks on the edge of the stream pulling their ponchos
out and covering themselves up completely looking like
great sad useless tents hardly paying attention to the
surrounding forest

Shot whiskered old looking Rhah pulling his
poncho out getting into it his tired lined face peering
out from under the hood Squatting on a rock Thinking
Pulling out a bowl and a small plastic bag Pilling the
bowl with the last of his Forest Nash Throws the bag in
the stream Anthony slowly comes up on him Wearing his
poncho which he drapes over Rhahs head as Rhah strikes a
match and lights the bowl A crack of thunder Smoke
rising from the poncho Coming off his face Rhahs face
glowing with contentment as the thunder peals again

Offers the bowl up to Anthony who taking it seats him-
self next to Rhah and smokes They both look out into the
hard rain thinking Shot of Rhahs exhausted face Camera
to Anthony who is staring into the woods on the side of the
stream the rain beating in his face The camera going to
what he sees -- a tangle of forest and leaves falling off
the trees and rare cries

Dianas petulant voice off

Hide Hide Hide why do you hide things

His eyes slowly pan the trees He answers in a
tired voice off

Because

Shot As face his eyes cast down Hisvoice
off
Joanna gee L loved you Without you
it is darkness
His eyes rising Shot of the woods
Shot Rhahs face in profile Thinking Fventu-
ally he says in passing
Isaac didnt come back
During this scene of thought on the rocks between
Rhah and Anthony Francis and a few other brothers includ-
ing the white smoker Adams make a slow individual pro-
cessional by Rhah and A to take a pass on the pipe ‘They
come by in ones and leave again to go back to their own
rocks the effect is almost of a ceremony celebrated for

the last time

50 Lee (at the front) semi-shielded from the rain
sniffs the weed in the wind Looks hostilely towards
Rhah and Anthony His hand goes out to move out and re-
luctantly Bunny the point man moves out the others taking
their time rising

Shot from side fading into shot from front of
mercenaries moving down stream Bunny way out in front

The battle that now erupts is not heavy Itis
like the snake very quick and deadly and violent it is
over fast brutally it is achieved almost in silence and

the revenge is almost entire

Thunder peals again Bunny still way out front
passes a water snake reclining on a rock the snake not
bothering to move at the sight of these heavy waterlogged
tired objects inching by

Camera passing Bunny zooms toward the snake
Off-screen the trickles of stream water and a fast rus
tling like a snake But the rustling is heavier now
like bodies moving very quickly on both sides of the stream

Bunnys face as he hears He wades out to inves-
tigate The men behind him havent heard The stream is
deeper where he wades and the gurgling water rises to his
waist The noise stops He advances down the stream
Shot of the bush he sees He pans it His eyes almost
naturally come to settle on a pair of bare feet painted
green like the bush He goes by it almost comes back

His eyes tilt up and he sees Isaac standing there next to
atree looking down at him proudly knowingly his face
painted with brilliant colors his whole body nearly
naked striped like a snakes The paint ingrained in the
skin not dripping off in the rain

Zoom to closeup of Isaac his submachine gun
still cradled in his arms

Cut Closeup Bunnys amazed frightened face

Several cracks of a rifle

Closeup of the blood spreading on his young face
He falls into the stream

Quick Cut Closeup a huge mine set in a tree

It explodes Same shot repeated three times in quick
succession

Silence A bird crying Shot of the trees
blowing with the force of the explosion (the same shot
Anthony saw in his mind back at Alexanders) leaves and
branches flying through the air noiselessly

Quick black out

In the silence the screen opens again with a
full screen Blow Up of Francis face as he is hit Francis
collapsing into the stream Panning to a bandanna floating
by itself in the stream A body tumbling onto it The
heavy machine gun the body was carrying crashing on the
rocks next to him Camera zooming out slowly catching the
living trying to fish the dead and woulded out of the
stream Manny one of the wounded still gesturing to his
radio which is sinking in the stream A brother reaching
for it He jerks back shot in the head

Camera still zooming out on the chaos still the
silence catches the brother Robinson coming out on the
bank opposite to the one on which the dead machine gunner
lies and sprinting closely past the camera into the bush
We see his white eyes full of fear Sound returning
momentarily Sound of firing and cries of the wounded
and from the opposite bank the cries of the attackers
all painted man and woman black and white charging down

to the stream Camera swivelling around as Robinson hurls

agrenade On one knee trembling pulling another grenade
out from his belt Sound of first grenade exploding The

lastsound Back to silence Robinson pulling the pin

from the grenade across his body its a faulty device
the grenade blows right in his face

Sound The same explosion that killed Robinson
Shot a poisonous snake slithering through the rocks trying
to escape this madness Anthony being hurled by the close
explosion down over the snake The snake in reaction
biting him in the arm Anthony jerks grimacing with the
pain The snake slithering off Anthony on his knees
in quick reaction pulling his knife out Pins the hissing
snake (Fleeting third-of-a-second images of 1 Isaac
slicing the snakes head off in the temple fading swiftly
into 2 Anthony and Joanna in the woods falling together
entwined cut as knife slicing the poisonous snakes
head off He recoils from his action sawagely a bit
stunned his eyes glazed with savagery The butt of a
rifle no sooner crashes on his head One of the tribes-
men straddles him as he lies on the ground his head bleed-
ing about to scalp him a brutal look of revenge on his
face It is the former leader of The Tribe His knife
in the air A hand grips it hard Stays it The tribes-
man turning to Isaac Hesitates Runs off to kill again
Isaac looking at the unconscious Anthony His smashed
camera lies next to him Seeing the dead snake taking

it all in with a little gleam of the eyes perhaps amused

by the irony and as Joanna runs up on him carrying a
rifle Isaac bends to quickly cut the poison out of AS
arm Joanna feeling Anthonys brow and the would on his
head her savage look of revenge melting into tenderness
looking at Isaac who nods quickly to indicate hell be
alright she runs her hand over his forehend quickly one
last time and runs off to fight

This whole scene could be ridiculous
if it isnt done brusquely swiftly like a dream in
Anthonys head

The sound is off again The battle coming to an
end The next scenes speeding by dreamlike The attackers
pouring down in mass onto the Stream even little children

Fade into

A black tribesman on top of a young black
soldier both of them straining the tribesmans knife is

The battle is over The rain has broken Lee
is lying bloodied on the stream bank on his back still
barely breathing his eyes closed he is squinting madly
like a fish on land trying to breathe His bloody red
bandanna is loosely draped around his neck on his belly
Medium shot A passing female member of the tribe Sees
him Shoots him Long shot of her shooting him The
hollow clack of her rifle Still the long shot as she runs
into the woods with the rest of the tribe In the distance
we hear the drone of a helicoptor coming up The stream is

deserted but for the bodies littered around it Same long

shot Camera turning to catch Isaac at medium range
looking down at the stream the last to leave The
helicoptor approaching Helooks up The trees conceal
the stream from the sky The wind from the hovering
helicoptors blades is blowing the trees wildly back and
forth Standing on the slope looking down at the stream
he raises his rifle in the classic Indian fashion flat
in the air (the same shot seen earlier at the Temple
except we only saw his arm) and shouts a word in a
strange language A subtitle flashes on the screen
FREEDOM

Isaac runs off into the woods the wind in the
trees blowing wildly Joanna waits for him at the edge
of the woodline just as she waited for the Old Leader
He disappears in The Forest She follows

Prison

The story goes on Anthony awakes as from a
dream at first isnt sure of what he is anymore falls
back on his distrust of Life is arrested put in Prison
Here in endless silence the Silence of the Fish he cuts
his final tie to the world of Alexander and regains his
sense of feelings in the person of Jonah who is a briefer
form Of Isaac At the same time Alexander his Own
prisoner wrapping his words about himself severs his
every link to the World Anthonys relationship to Jonah
is brief dreamlike beautiful From it he accepts that
Love Life itself is just a Dream A Movie Feelings are
Dreams Dreams are Feelings Freedom is Dream Dream is
Freedom Anthony dreams on makes movies and in his

dreamin his life he leaves Prison Hes free

51 Anthonys eyes looking up opening from a dark
screen onto light a kind face looming above him asking
just as he opens his eyes

Would you like me 40 say a prayer for
your my son

Screen fading into darkness as

Anthony closes his eyes Opening them again The Fathers
questioning eyes The camera moving a little higher as A
begins to rise up look around make sure he is not dying
He is slowly looking around He is in a hospital all

blazing white The patients including A are in black

pyjamas with pink hospital monograms on their breast In
bed next to him one of the patients has died and the white
sheet is spread over his face but his hand is stiffly
hanging out from the sheet

A (as he looks around the hospital)

Cigarettes1ll do

Father 0 any particular brand
A Menthols if you have any
F (smiling producing two separate

brands one pack full one almost empty) Take your choice

A taking the last cigarette from the empty pack
The Priest striking a match lighting his cigarette A
sucking in on it looking over at the dead patients
outstretched hand

The Priest seeing this looking at hand saying

We couldnt preserve him I think

the boy was Protestant (Walks to the bed puts the hand
back under the sheet lifting the sheet as he does this
Anthony sees the puffed white face of Adams ye is jolted)

Rhah is strutting down the aisle to visit A
wearing his dress uniform His coat is afghan with a lot
of sheeps fur Taking it off as he comes up on A the
Same thiefs smile on his face Under the coat wearing
a pink Cossack shirt with black vest and black leggings
and a large Macedonian belt with a snakes head on it His
boots are laced to his knees and from outside the cossack

shirt on a looping thick necklace hanging from his neck a

black skull and ivory white cross hang side by side He
looks like he just came out of the forest -- wild crazy

Rhah Whats happening Father IS our son
going to get well or did the snake put the evil seed into
him

Father (surprised by this visitor) No I
think Our Fathers son is in good hands

Rhah kissing Anthony on both cheeks rising

turning to face the Father

We both must be because (smiling
crazily) dig it Father Im still here (As he says

this the dead patients hand casually drops down from the
sheet once again and the Father sees Rhahs strange neck-
lace his eyes growing a little wider Feeling uncomfortable
in his presence )

Rhah turning back to Anthony taking some comic
books out of his coat

Rhah Look here I brought you some books to
kill the time

Anthony examining the covers Enemy Ace (a long
thin ghastly looking drawing) Spider Man and another one
(Doctor Strange) with a cover drawing of an immense creature
of evil with huge green eyes and hair hanging to his
shoulders and immensely long fingernails Opening the book
he finds a few thinly rolled cigarettes taped to one of the
pages Looks up at Rhah who is smiling Rhah points to

the huge creature on the cover says both to the Father and

Anthony wiggling his shoulders a little

Rhah Actually that huge ugly creatures got
a soul It blew my mind when he said to himself “Cmon
now Beast get a hold of yourself If 1 keep up this nutty
soul-searching Il be a candidate for the funny farm

Rhah snickering

Anthony doesnt join in

The Father more uncomfortable than ever Produces
a pocket Bible giving it to Anthony

Yes well I must be on my way Here
is a small Bible for you Anthony it will pass the time
I will return (Leaves ignoring Rhah)

Rhah bending over Anthonys face and sneering at
the departing Priest His fist goes out in a gesture Of
triumph He is laughing now

Anthony unable yet to attach himself to Rhah
saying in a monotone

Wow I think you blew his mind man

Rhah (interrupting his laughter) Yea

Putting his fist out again A returning the
fist tapping Rhahs fist from the top Rhah coming over
and tapping As fist with his fist Rhah sneering and
laughing again stopping again

Yea

skull and cross A scratching the scar below the eye)

with admiration)

A not looking at Rhah

Rhah - (rearing up a bit) Take care of yourself

barricade of twenty-five motorcycle policemen seen later)
I can go back to Mississippi and plant all the seeds I want

the South But you (pointing his finger) No (his finger
waving) Theres going to be an earthquake in California

brown leather breeches and the tightly laced boots of his

shiny red beads around his neck and wears a green mao shirt
very quiet and silent he is blown out of his head and his
top four front fangs are framed in gold the two outside
teeth have green rubies mounted on them the inner two
teeth have heart-shaped red diamonds mounted so on the
rare occasions that he smiles his teeth glisten in red
and green

hands behind their backs watching the examiners and the
examined

Shots of exiting passengerssoldiers in forms
of eastern dress contrasting with the square neckties the
Officials all in black with badges wear As these
passengers leave the building a few are intercepted by
the roving officials and pointed towards a side door --
the physical examining room The majority however walking
out the door to freedom Anthony sees this -- first a
passenger being intercepted then his eyes moving to the
door where theres fresh air and sun waiting Looking
down at the official who is repacking his suitcase full Of

rich clothes -- purple shirts etc a large flamboyant hat

He looks up and sees Flash baggage in hand
moving towards the doors walking slowly and ultra
steadily He is stopped by one of the old grey-haired
jowly officials Flash talking to him slowly turning his
back to Anthony the official turning with him Anthonys
eyes taking this in Flash seems in command of the
situation and as the loudspeaker announces a departure
Flash with the official following turns back around
slowly his dark mirror-like shades panning slowly down
the baggage line panning past Anthony as he continues
to move his lips

Anthony picks his baggage up Starts a slow
slightly stiff walk towards the doors Sound of his foot-
steps Flash ahead of him exiting through the doors a
gleam of sunlight shining into the airport as he opens the
door Anthonys eyes feeling dizzy The camera swirling
around the Airport quickly one time A large ad for The
Sun and a big red fireball with an airplane gliding past

officials hands behind his back bouncing up and down on
his heels Camera dwelling on him Anthony walking past
him Shot of a hand lightly touching his shoulder

Into the hall two rs1 men in black suits with
narrow lapels and hatless waiting the one in charge

giving A an amused look of disgust A in his furry afghan

coat The FBI man nodding his flat crewcut head as if
to say I like it
An attractive rich-looking woman in her thirties
is handcuffed to a chair in the hall looking as if she is
about to cry lines of fatigue under her eyes as if this

was her first narcotics arrest

The FBI man unlocking her from the chair The
handcuffs are shiny and big and silver His key very
small She is hassled and twists her wrist He smiles and

says to her
The more you move the tighter they get
He handcuffs her to Anthony She hardly looks at
him she is so distracted He looks at her The blood

smeared on his mouth

FBI Lets go

56 Shot Getting into their black sedan the FBI men
in the front the assistant driving the one in charge
seated with his back to the road not taking his eyes from
the two prisoners in the rear The windows are sealed up
The sunlight outside is sparkling They drive The woman
distracted looking out the window nervously at the passing
streets Anthony looking at her beginning to fully
understand what is going to happen to him now He is no
longer stoned Looking out the window with her The

streets assume a fish-eyed aspect cut

57 Prison Shot of an electronic door sliding shut
Sound of other electric doors opening and closing Grating
metal on metal followed by this underwater hollow silence
A momentary sound of bubbling water in a fish tank A shot
of the tropical fish swimming in the aquarium Fading into
a shot of a strong muscled black standing gripping the
bars looking out blankly his t-shirt off muscled arms
and his powerful chest exposed A black beard A sardine-
shaped ring hanging from his left ear Fading into shot of
Anthony in shabby light beige prison pyjamas the top

removed revealing a sleeveless t-shirt exposing his under-

arms He is sleeping on a mattress on the floor of his
cell Blankets lying messily about a few prison books
His sleep is simple childlike His long hair is completely
unkempt He sleeps with his mouth closed on his belly one

arm loosely wrapped around his neck the other flung out

Camera dwelling on him fading again into the
aquarium full of tropical fish fading from there to the
prison block about ten cells to the block and one ayroom
five-six prisoners in each overcrowded cell The shot is
of the prisoners in singles walking about pointlessly
just to move not more than six or seven treading

The prisoners are all young except for one or
two old lifers they are mostly smugglers hard types out
of motorcycle gangs repair shops broken families and in
California style very hip young they have smiles that
say they know the score Quite a few have beards and

tattoos but no external ornaments which is not allowed

so as distinguishing marks they use their threads
Each walks differently from the
other like different types of fish in an aquarium There
is also a large minority of old ‘hippy types young not
so tough a fatalistic young romantic look about them
Society was unchangeably lame and it was inevitable they
should end up behind bars When they get out they will
probably split into the hills to Mexico South America
islands unheard and never return Their hair is very long
a lot of golden brown beards and once-suntanned faces very
quiet keeping to themselves not even talking each sits
by himself and meditates They look very primitive in their

shabby pyjama pants and t-shirts

58 Camera panning through the block Voice off
Over there Getting into the car

Camera fading to catch three of the prisoners
swarming high up near the ceiling on the bars like fish
rather than monkeys looking out the small slit of a window
looking down into the parking lot

Side Shot (close) of their faces catching the
sunlight One of them sucking in his breath

Shot Blonde getting into the car in the Sun-

heart of the city

wide eyed exaggerated effect Fading into

Shot of the head trustee (also a prisoner)

bearded coming up behind the prisoners Pointing

Get down
59 Camera following trustee as he walks on down the
block He is a powerful looking young man Stops at a
cell Looking inside Anthony lying on the mattress

still sleeping though he has changed vositions and is
sleeping childlike on his side his arm still about his
neck the other arm outflung a toilet bowl and basinin
the cell One bunk bed Very cramped Trustee glancing

to see everything is in order

60 Walks further on down the block Passes two
brothers with pompadours sparring with each other in the
space between the cells and the bars Passes by them
unconcernedly and passes out of the cameras eyS as the
camera remains to dwell on the brothers They move well
taking it easy equally sized They start slapping a
little harder noses bristle sweat starts up a few others
gather round coming from separate directions alone
digging the action The camera observing their faces as
the fighters pass out of the cameras eye the mixture of
hard types and nomadic types

The fighters come back into view dancing One

of them is now Anthony jabbing sparring with a brother
oo

who is probably an amateur boxer and is getting the better
of A slapping him harder and harder with his open palm
his own nose starting to open and close his mouth working
small cries as if he were taking a black vengeance on the
white boy The hard unsympathetic faces of the gathered
crowd As blurring vision his opponents face fades into

that Of Francis hitting him harder and harder his face

fading into the Blow Up at the stream -- his dying face
erying

61 Voice (off very-loud) Ulysses1 Alberto
Ulysses

Camera panning to one of the guards walking down
the corridor outside the bars calling this name The
fight breaks up The two brothers (not Anthony) who were
originally sparring calmly quickly walk off in separate
directions

Ulysses walking past them towards the sliding
door at the far end of the block Waiting there The door
slides open Another door Camera catching him walking
down the corridor with the guard behind him The guard
stopping at a box tied to the bars and taking the slips

full of special requests following Ulysses out the

corridor They disappear
Fade
62 A waking up from his sleep his hair very

dishevelled lines under his eyes (he has slept most of the

days and nights away) Looking around in a daze at the
blankets The little shelves on the wall are neat with
small personal possessions on them A young prisoner
lying on the top bunk

A Can I get some cigarettes
The young cat reading a Readers Digest turning
the page his voice distant
Sunday
A Can I get one from you I havent had
a smoke in days
Long pause

(Turning the page of his magazine) No

shower stops Comes out Dries himself humming then
singing

Fade

64 Anthony on the mattress trying to read a prison-
book Putting it down in boredom Rutting himself in the
yoga position Breathing in deep like a fish Disliking
it Getting up walking in his singular tread towards
the dayroom passing the brother drying himself outside the
shower which is in the dayroom Going to the small stove
where the coffee pot is brewing Looking at it The

brother coming over in his towel taking the lid off the

coffee

Urn smelling just nice
A Yea all I need is a coffee cup
Brother heading back towards the shower to pick
up his soap and slippers Looking back over his shoulder

65 Close shot an old lifer crying Chow

Low animal mumbles following his cry down the
block Prisoners heading back to their individual cells
It is late afternoon but the clock on the wallis broken
so it doesnt really matter The corridor outside the cells
is now empty A silver dinner tray glistening chrome the
center of attraction wheels past the electric door into
the cell The trustee by himself rolls it down the cells
into the dayroom some of the mens faces looking at it as
it passes their cell

The Trustee (calling out) Four Five Six

The men from these cells eagerly pour out heading

for the dayroom They eat voraciously Two pieces of white

bread no butter ravioli and a small sticky piece of cake
Nothing to drink but coffee anthony eating with them his
undershirt still on his hair a mess There is little talk
The sparring brother the same one who was in the shower is
sitting with another brother across from A Looking at A
curiously Asks
Whatcha ya in for man

A rising going to the sink in the dayroom
drinking water out of the tap turning around taking a long
deep breath wondering what hes going to do next

Fade

66 Anthony later at night is looking out the bars
He has pulled himself together has combed his hair
showered removed his t-shirt stands barechested has
washed his face he is thinking

Fade into his thoughts

He sees the faces of Joanna Isaac Francis and
Rhah each of them separately Joanna standing painted green
under the tree where he first saw her Francis singing his
blues Isaac offering him the snakes head to drink Rhah
giving him the coat in the hospital

They fade On the other side of the bars looking
in he sees Alexander The camera panning past him casually
no element of magic in it

Anthony turning around walking back to his cell

Alexanders voice (off low as an interior

monologue)

Once I spoke to you of long silences
where we stare just stare at air Once 1 spoke to you and
said life was but a dream its been said I said I was
what you are JI am what youre going to be
Closeup Anthonys face
He enters the cell
Anthonys voice off as in interior monologue

Dont the winds ever change

67 He sees Jonah huddled up in a blanket on the
floor slightly trembling as if this prison were too cold
for him Hes rubbing himself slightly under the blanket
His hair is black Indian long and wavy hanging to his
shoulders the reincarnation almost of Isaac but younger
about seventeen eighteen He has a beautiful face much
warmer features than Isaac his two eyes bright and looking
straight straight ahead as if he were on a permanent high
His voice is soft and when he talks he smiles tenderly
with his eyes and sometimes his mouth He has a slight
accent -- sounding almost Israeli or European

Anthony sits down next to him on the floor not
feeling any need to explain why he sits down next to him
He is simply attracted by him by his warmth and by the
sensitivity that makes him tremble in the cold prison

Jonah looks at Anthony with his wide eyes He
smiles trembles but doesnt speak Anthony is forced

to ask
What did you do
Jonah smiling wrapping his hands around his
shoulders under the blanket
They call it White Slavery
Anthony looking at him puzzled
Jonah The little girl told the Judge she was
raped steadily for half a year and she was so beautiful
in a pink dress in the court the Judge he believed her

(laughing a little) so they take me to the big prison

tomorrow

A For how long

J (looking ahead trembling For five
years

Pause Sorrow on Anthonys face Jonah seeing

his face Changes the subject

J Where do you come from
A From the East
J I was over there (smiling) When I was

just a boy I fought with the Tribes They call me Jonah

A I fought with the soldiers Im
Anthony
Jonah looking straight into As eyes
Good Im glad you came and talked to
me I needed somebody to talk to ma (Turning away) Im

scared tonight (Trembling)
Anthony almost touching his shaking shoulder

with his hand Hesitating Pulling it back in
ne

Jonah (not seeing him do this a slight
smile on his face) I was twelve when 1 first killed I
lay in a tree all day I set a snare The soldiers came
by late in the afternoon and they tripped it It was
an old-fashioned bow and arrow but it killed And I was
so happy Have you killed

Anthony (pause) No

Isaac (smiling) Dia you rape the women
A (pausing) No
Isaac (smiling) You didnt steal anything

A shakes his head

Isaac Are you proud
A (at a bit of a loss) Sometimes
Isaac Who is your woman

Anthony puckers his smile shrugs

Isaac (Also smiling) It doesnt matter any
more does it

Anthony Ho

fsaac (smiling) How old are you

Anthony (smiles a little shrugs) I dont
think I remember

Pause Jonah has stopped trembling His interest
in Anthony has brought him out of his fear of the future

Jonah (looking at A tenderly) I remember
Im eighteen My mother and father were killed by the
soldiers I was taken from the Forest imprisoned here

They set me free and I wandered into the City The City
etn

was cold and hard and I was lost but there were people like
you Anthony in the City There are a lot of them We
shared together We made love Ive loved more beautiful
things than there are stars and Im only eighteen and
youre older but Anthony (looking straight into his eyes)
believe me believe me you never good god you never
lose track of your heat (taking his hand from the
blanket) Take my hand Feel it

Anthony feeling it
Jonah Yours are cold Mine are warm
Shot short Anthony chasing Joanna through the
woods His voice off in a whisper
I remember
Jonali You have to kill Anthony (Shot very
short Anthony killing the gneke) You have to love You

have to be free (Shot Anthony chasing Joanna through the

woods His voice off I remember) and you have to be
warm (Shot Anthony catching Joanna in the woods (no sound)
in siow mecion toppling over on the ground their bodies
entwining His voice off in a whisper I remember)

Pause Anthony feeling the warmth coming off
Jonah Jenahs eyes smiling encouragement and tenderness
at him

Jonah now youre warm (lithely moving over
closer to Anthony) youve been warmbefore I can tell
(He kisses Anthony lightly on the cheek) It isnt solemn

its light joyous easy (Anthony returns the kiss) His

voice off I remember Anthony slowly takes Jonahs head
in his hands brings it together with his Anthony
releases his breath Jonahs hand feels his cheek gropes
along on it They kiss each others mouth tenderly their
eyes closed Fade past the faces of Joanna Francis
Isaac Rhah in that order back to the face of Alexander
who sits all in black by himself in his apartment slumped
in a chair his hands between his knees looking very sad

his head hanging off his left shoulder His voice off

very low

68 Your mind was mine Anthony We dreamt
together We discovered reality and it died with the dream
and what we draamt we could never have We grew another
mind We emancipated our souls and the cost was that
our feelings died We buried ourselves in the security Of

thought and not knowing it we fell prey to our own minds
Our thought was hungry If it cannot eat other minds and
other minds cannot eat it then like some horrible plant
which you accused me of being the mind will curl in and
eat its own self

Alexander rises from the chair Fading into

Anthony and Jonah together fading into

69 Alexanders face returning painted in vivid
tribal colors -- yellow black red blazing colors His
books and papers are strewn on the floor in front of him

He is pouring gasoline through his apartment The posters

and paintings are ripped off the walls except for the

Rimbaud which he now stops to look at

His voice (off) Big explosions pockmark our
skies Aristotle Aquinas Shakespeare Joyce
Rimbaud ending like literature in death and disease

Rimbauds hollow boys voice off
and one night I will lose and come

to regard as sacred the disorder of my mind

Alexander taking the Rimbaud off the wall and
throwing it with the rest on the floor

Alexander his voice off kneeling to examine
what he has devoted his life to

For this descend sin by sin into

a maelstrom full of false dreams arising like twilight
false words that dance by the moon and mirror themselves
at the bottom of the oceans floor for this God I
did my very best I opened moons 1 swallowed sleeping
forms I sang songs that sighed with effort Sighs too
deep for words and prayers from the deepest pit of the
brain 0 God 1 was in you and you were in me Emerging
from mists Leaping up like winter-spring ardor to
light sodden coals of creativity it was patience and it
was passion it yearned in the horrifying silence Of
infinity Does appetite grow again and I a god am
I reborn Did Zeus swallow his own flesh in order to

preserve it do I not swallow my own self in order to live

again
Alexander rising on camera His voice still
off in parody of what he has just said

I was conceived by my father born of
my mother suffered under both was crucified for this
(pointing at papers) died and soundly buried but the third
day I rose again from Hell and ascended unto Heaven where
I sit on the right hand of God The Father Fiction from
whence I shall come to judge all painters all poets
all creators you amen

Walking towards his fireplace taking the old
medieval torch off the all shifting moods his voice off

Must sin must rise up Must smash the
barrier of my selfish Ego Must free Free Fire Flew
I go Walking to and fro Through the Ego he Walked
through the Eg To and fro he walked Through the Ego
Through the garden of Ego

Lighting the torch He holds it next to him
burning brilliantly casting a weird surreal light on his
painted face His voice mocking

In many centuries from now «e when the
futurians dig up theageold crusts of our earth they
will discover a bronzed likeness of a human being from the
Twentieth Century and they will marvel at this figurepiece
and they will hang it in their lighted museums for all the
survivors to see and they will flock about it and they
will celebrate it and they will never again commit it to
earth for and it wkll be Me (laughs Checks

As he does this his voice businesslike )

The world it was writ shall be
cleansed this time not by water but by fire (The sheet
with his large looping handwriting on it burning Alexander
looking at his two cats who are circling uncomfortably under
a table) It burns like cats slinking away slowly at

hand scratched by the she pen she knows everything I know

Alexander putting the torch to the books and
papers It starts up just as in the opening scene Then
it quiets and starts to spread and burn The cats the hair
on their hacks retreating up against the wall hissing

Alx (off) The fire rumbles like a pig in
the slough frightened so very frightened still of its
fate its awareness that y am real not unreal not false
Mow in the hot heart of hell this real I burns the she out

love stealing stealing killing killing 0 fantastic

(The flames spreading wildly through the apartment
Shot of Anthonys fleeing footsteps (scene 1) The cats
screaming Alexander backing off from the heat his eyes
alight with madness sounds of breaking and tearing and the
roar of the flames)

Sound fades His voice off calmer more lucid
bringing to an end

In the garden when I was young the
small graceful lions run They are beasts of a fabulous
elegance they sniff flowers and crack open pink parasols
when I was young in the aethiopian gloom in the shaded
memoy of afternoons splendid with ambitious odors and
primitive yearnings and f embraced it all sing that once
I stood in front of the dawn and bathed my sandals in the
sea that once on freezing frontiers my armies roamed that
I kissed the hands of fantasy queens and bade my time
pausing on flowers these and arabia too where the winds
shrive in the sapphire waters off moorish Spain fields
Of flanders and wheat so golden it devoured the sun songs
Of Swedish castles and songs of spiders groans of feeling
from dungeon corners and keening organ music in german
towns and nights in the forest and days so black widows
tears ran with the Rhine - - The christ was long distant
and light so far ahead and I lay my cheek down on the side

of an alp and ran my toes through the gnows of afghanistan

In the north was the nothing towards the south the void
and over it an old God had hung an invisible mantle he
called Life its so sad so meaningless (Meaningless-

ness in his voice) In its bosom we play the practice of

our hearts our hearts expire puff adders vex the desert
sand we titter we stop without warning we see
the genesis and the genius and harmonies collide and

the eye is lost in puzzles of fire

(Alexander is now a negative)

His voice (off) My throat above the fire
Fire my throat in the fire floating backwards »« the
last secret to madness the core the rot beinglessness
embrace the steel spit clog choke on the semi-
circles of the moon fantasy blood purple flamed
then gut and sink into the wealth of fire at the music
end of Death

Alexanders negative engulfed in the fire

Slow fade on the fire engulfing everything

69 Fading into -Anthony and Jonah embraced but
Anthonys face as if he knows what has happened is looking
up looking at nothing There is sadness in his face
Fading into mirth the realization of dream

His voice (off) Feelings are dreams dreams
are feelings Freedom is Dream Dream is Freedom Its
all nothing but a Dream

He kisses Isaac They embrace

The son looking beginning to smile The guitar starts up

25) The big muscled black with the gleaming ear

ring seen at the beginning of The Prison sequence his hands

on the bars (the purr of the move camera) now his hands
wrapped around the guards neck who is pinned up against
the bars struggling The black making cold faces of
exertion bringing the guard lower and lower finishing
him on the floor Back up to the bars Look of intense
concentration on his face He takes the bars in hand and
like Steve Reeves bends them apart He just about makes
a circle out of the two bars bending them inwards giving
them a concave look Going through the breach The rest
of the prisoners following caution and excitement on their
faces emerging three or four at a time

Anthony through the bars In a double-breasted
suit a flower in the lapel Little gangster gun in his
hand an ultra-broad brimmed hat on his head

The prisoners moving fast down the corridor
Anthony way behind them banging a guard on the head with
the gun Standing there over the guard turning one way
then another Cant makeup his mind Shooting him The
hollow clack breaking into the purr of the camera A
looking around he hasnt moved sees a vase full of flowers
sitting on a table in this corridor Pauses Shoots it
Vase and flowers breaking and falling A still hasnt
moved looks off down the corridor Sees himself filming
himself on camera his double in looser threads without a
hat Pauses Aims his little gun his doubles way Shot
of it (close) firing The hollow echo breaks the silence

Anthony picking a strawberry out of a strawberry bowl

Fade The prisoners running much faster through
the corridors of green and blue and pink suddenly breaking
out into an open green field full of flowers Crazy
Prisoners running like wild through the field some rolling
in the grass some hugging each other some pissing some
picking flowers the rest running very fast in separate
directions The last shot of the black Bar Bender tearing
through the grass (eye level shot) lively music playing off
the guitar

This abruptly stops The purr of the camera

Blow Up Comic strip Anthony as some kind of

caped crusader very fast

70 Fading into Anthony kissing Jonah goodbye fading
into Anthony at the electric door waiting for it to open
It opens Going through it Anthony disappearing in his
light beige pyjamas Sound of another electric door opening
Anthony in a cardin suit and turtleneck no hat walking dowr
the corridor on the other side of the bars (camera behind
bars) Side view as he walks on down the corridor and
disappears

The purr stops

The screen dissolves into colors shaped like
molecules perhaps a theme to it of three separate worlds
merging (cat white snake green red yellow black etc and

fish stripes dots) They merge Collide Melt
