MASON (0OS)
Don’t worry about it On my first
day I forgot everything they
taught me in those classes

NATE (0S)
Really

EXT GROUP HOME COTTAGE -- MORNING

Standing in a circle is MASON late-20s a hug-able bear with
a good heart and sense of humor JESSICA 20s with a
clipboard quiet confident and looks like she could kick
some ass and NATE 20s skinny and nervous as hell

MASON

Yeah I mean day one’s always a
little tough It’s like you know
no matter how the training goes
there’s always room for something
that’s just totally unpredictable

(realizing)
Oh I’ve got a pretty good story
for you if you’re ready for it

NATE
Ok

JESSICA
Hey what’s up

NATE
Hey

MASON
Did you guys meet

NATE
No Nate

JESSICA
Hi

NATE
Hey

JESSICA
Jessica

NATE

Jessica

MASON
Okay listen up so this was like
my first week on the job and Im
at gate duty
NATE
Whats that

Grace hops off her bike and walks it up to a small group
standing outside of the building

Grace jumps in Mason sees her for the first time

GRACE
If a kid wants to leave legally
we can’t stop them So we put
someone at the gate to try to talk
them out of it

MASON
Whoa You got here quick
GRACE
Yes I did Good morning
JESSICA
Hi
MASON
Nate this is Grace she’s your new
boss
GRACE
Oh
NATE
Hey
GRACE

Hi Nice to meet you

NATE
Nice to meet you

She shakes Nates hand

GRACE
I would lose the tie if I were you
And if you’re listening to a story
of Mason’s understand that there’s
very little reality in it

MASON
Hey dont piss in the water before
we put our toes in
Jessica hands Grace a clipboard of the nights report
JESSICA
(to Grace)
Night shift was pretty mellow

She goes through it as Mason entertains
MASON
Okay so Grace my wonderful new
boss at the time She leaves me at
my gate duty for like 3 hours
without a bathroom break and Im
dying because I ate the tacos that
they serve here and she failed to
tell me that theyre a known
laxative So this kid 16 years
old this big fucking intimidating
dude he’s like a foot taller than
me he walks up and he just
cruises out the gate It’s my
second day so I don’t know what
the hell is going on but Grace
She’s standing right there and she
just let’s it happen

GRACE
(interrupting)
Whatever what I saw was Mason just
sitting there and Wesley smiling
at me from the opposite side of the
gate because he knows that we
cant touch him

NATE
Why not

GRACE
Once they’re a foot outside the
gate we cant touch ‘em

MASON
So Grace tells me to follow him so
I do For hours just walking 8
feet behind him Eventually he
gets on this bus so I get on the
bus too And at this point I
cant think of anything but
whatever the hell these tacos are
doing to my bowels so I make up my
mind fuck this I got to get off
at the next stop or Im going to
lose it in my shorts right in front
of all these people And exactly
as I make this decision Wesley
leans his big-ass head over to me
from across the aisle and he says
really calm Im getting off at
the next stop and if you do too
Im going to rip your fucking balls
off and feed em to you

NATE
Holy shit

GRACE
Remember what I said
MASON

(to Grace)
Hey now this part is true I was
there
GRACE
Really Are you sure
MASON
Yeah
(to Nate)

So bus stops He gets off I
wait a second I go over to the
door but he’s just standing there
on the sidewalk like 10 feet away
staring at me waiting What can I
do I have no other choice So I
step off the bus and the second
that my feet touch the ground it
is like a knot in my asshole
unties and the fiesta in my
stomach just comes pouring down my
legs

Jessica Nate and Grace can’t help buy laugh

MASON (CONTD)
So I’m just standing there shit
gushing down my thighs I ruin my
fuckin’ favorite Nike’s and
Wesley’s just there doubled over
losing it I mean he’s fuckin’
laughing so hard -

BOOM The door from the unit flies open and Sammy comes
running out in his underwear swinging his doll around

SAMMY
Wooooohoooo0

He takes off into the yard Grace immediately takes off
after him Mason follows right behind

MASON
Here we go Nate

NATE
Wait what

GRACE
Come on Nate

Nate looks to Jessica real nervous

JESSICA
Go

Nate runs after them
Grace and Mason begin to gain on Sammy

GRACE
Sammy

Sammy fakes them out a couple of times making them work for
it

Grace finally gets close enough to grab him Sammy hoots
like hes having a blast

Mason grabs his arm

SAMMY
Let me go you fucking perverts

Nate catches up

GRACE
Nate grab his feet please

Nate nervously follows directions grabbing the boys feet
Together Mason and Nate force him to sit down on the grass
Sammy SCREAMS

MASON
Were just going to sit down here
on the grass until you de-escalate

SAMMY
De-escalate my asshole you duck
fuckers
The three sit down in the grass as Mason smiles to himself
MASON
Im not quite sure what you mean by
that
Grace holds Sammys feet
GRACE
You know the drill Sammy just let
it pass

Sammy keeps struggling but quickly realizes he cant do
anything

MASON
You alright buddy

Sammy breathes heavily
MASON (CONTD)
You got pretty far that time I
think it’s a new record

The three sit until things calm down
And when its finally calm Mason continues like nothing

happened

Sammy catches his breathhe shakes his head
then no again

MASON (CONT’D)
So anyway after all that he ends
up coming back with me but only
because he’s so excited to tell
everyone on our unit that I pooped
my pants And he does He tells
everyone somehow it even got back
to my mom You heard that story

JESSICA

bag of marijuana a pre-rolled joint and a lighter

She flips back through her notebook to a page that is covered
with cool illustrations of underwater scenes and creatures
particularly sharks and octopi

JAYDEN
Its a kids story so there arent
any big words

GRACE
Okay

Jayden begins As she reads she points to the illustration
that she wants Grace to look at

She points to a small sketch of a cute little octopus

JAYDEN
Once upon a time somewhere miles
and miles beneath the surface of
the ocean there lived a young
octopus named Nina

She points to various drawings of the octopus making funny
artwork out of shells and sand

JAYDEN (CONTD)

Nina spent most of her time alone
making strange creations out of
rocks and shells And she was very
happy

(beat )
But then on Monday the Shark
showed up

She points to a drawing of a Shark swimming up to Nina

JAYDEN (CONT’D)
Whats your name said the
shark Nina she replied Do
you want to be my friend He
asked Okay what do I have to
do Said Nina Not much said
the Shark Just let me eat one of
your arms

Grace watches Jayden read

JAYDEN (CONTD)
Nina had never had a friend before
so she wondered if this was what
you had to do to get one She
looked down at her eight arms and
decided it wouldnt be so bad to
give up one So she donated an arm
to her wonderful new friend

Jayden points to a morbid drawing of the shark eating one of
Ninas arms

JAYDEN (CONTD)
Every day that week Nina and the
Shark would play together They
explored caves built castles of
sand and swam really really fast
And every night the Shark would be
hungry and Nina would give him
another one of her arms to eat

Jayden points at various illustrations of the octopus and the
shark playing together and the shark eating her arms

JAYDEN (CONT’D)
On Sunday after playing all day
the Shark told Nina that he was
very hungry I dont understand
she said Ive already given you
six of my arms and now you want
one more The shark looked at her
with a friendly smile and said I
dont want one This time I want
them all But why Nina asked
And the shark replied Because
thats what friends are for

Jayden points to another drawing of the shark alone

JAYDEN (CONTD)

When the shark finished his meal
that night he felt very sad and
lonely He missed having someone
to explore caves build castles and
swim really really fast with He
missed Nina very much So he swam
away to find another friend

Jayden folds up the piece of paper and grips it in her hand
She stares down at her drawings waiting

Grace watches her for a moment before speaking

GRACE
Jayden did your dad ever hurt you

Jayden doesnt respond at first But then shrugs without
looking up Grace watches her

GRACE (CONTD)
Does he still hurt you

Jayden doesnt respond She hides her face with her hand
Grace sits with her for a moment before putting her arm on
her back

She sees tears plopping down onto the drawings of the octopus
and the shark

The two sit side by side

Everyone begins to hoot and yell as they drink from their

the baby from across the room He nods and smiles at the
sight of her with a baby She smiles and shrugs its not so
bad

GRACE
Thats not even the point Jack
Did you read my report

JACK
Of course I did and I was very
concerned But when Jaydens social
worker asked her about it she said
her father has never been abusive
in any way

GRACE
Of course she said that shes
fucking scared What the fuck do
they teach you guys in grad school

Jacks a bit taken aback by her temper

GRACE (CONTD)
Jack in her mind he is always
right behind her watching her
when she is sleeping she is taking
a shit when she is alone with her
therapist he is right there
watching her ready to pounce And
you just expect her to just come
out and say it Are you guys
fucking stupid Because she was
here asking for help and you just
sent her back to the fucking shark

Jack is very offended by her language and temper He takes
off his glasses and pinches the bridge of his nose and closes
his eyes

JACK
I realize youre upset Grace but
yelling at me isn’t an effective
form of communication

Grace realizes she wont get to him this way She sits down

GRACE
Okay Jack Jack Im sorry
Please Cancel the pass until we
figure this out Because I know
her and I know that things are not
good at home

JACK
And how do you know that Because
she read you a childrens story

GRACE
Dont fuck with me Jack I amon
the floor every day with those
kids And last night that girl
sat next to me and she cried and
she tried to tell me the only way
that she knew how

JACK
Grace you are a line staff Its
not your job to interpret tears
Thats what our trained therapists
are here for

GRACE
Then your trained therapists dont
know shit

JACK
Did she tell you that she was being
abused by her father

GRACE
She didnt have to

JACK
If I’m gonna take that child away
from her biological parent yes

GRACE
This is bullshit

JACK
Grace I have been working with
these kids for longer than youve
been alive and there’s not one of
them that I wouldn’t die for I
look into those broken eyes I want
to find the asshole who did that to
them and beat the shit out of him
But although I feel that way every
single day I know I cant track
down everyone who’s hurt them I
know I cant heal all their wounds
And I cant start accusing all
their parents of being sexual
offenders

Grace holds back her temper
GRACE
Especially when their friends of
friends right Jack

Jack looks at her seriously

JACK
Were finished here Grace

Jack picks up the phone dials and swivels his chair so his
back is to Grace

She stands over him looking down at his open mouth Her
grip tightens around the bat

Her breathing quickens as she positions the silver bat over
his open mouth

His hot breath fogs the shiny surface

She slowly raises it over her head keeping her eyes focused
on her target Her hands shake with adrenaline

squeezes down on the handle shifts her feet and takes one
last look at his face

Then she lifts up her shirt to reveal the fresh wounds
across her lower back swollen red stripes bruised and
slightly bleeding

guy he’s really tough really
quiet but he’s cool he’s just
kind of like kicking back and
checking out the scene And I
swear I didnt hear him say a word
the whole first week he was here
But then one day we’re doing a
community meeting and we ask for
announcements and this guy raises
his hand And he looks directly at
Liza Green and he says I know
you dont know me and I just got
here but I just wanna say that
Ive been watching you and I think
youre the most interesting thing
about this place And Im really
sad Im not going to get to know
you before you leave I just
wanted to tell you that

Mason motions to Grace to confirm his quote

NATE
What a pimp What did she say

MASON
Nothing Nothing it got so
fucking awkward I couldnt stand
it and then she left and never
talked to him and the kids teased
him for like a year about it

NATE
Ah that blows

MASON
Nah he didnt give a shit Didnt
even phase him Like he knew
something everybody else didnt

NATE
Who was this guy

MASON
That was Marcus

JESSICA
What I never heard this story

GRACE
Oh wait It gets so much better
MASON
Yeah yeah So check this out
Grace and I are getting coffee at
Ronnies this morning and we walk
in and who do we see sittin there
alone at a table Marcus

JESSICA
Hows he doing

MASON
He looks great

GRACE
He’s so good

MASON
Button-up shirt he was sipping on
a cappuccino

NATE
Marcus drinks cappuccinos

GRACE
Apparently now he does

Grace nods

MASON
So were talking to him and we’re
catching up and he’s telling us
about his new job at the aquarium
and how much he takes home in tips
and how hes gonna start applying
for classes next semester and it’s
weird ‘cause I’m like I have not
heard Marcus talk this much ever
since I met him Like what is the
deal Is he excited to see us Is
he nervous about something And
that’s when I notice there’s
another cappuccino on the table and
an empty chair next to him

Theyre all glued to Masons every word
MASON (CONTD)
And then just like in the fucking
movies the bathroom door flings
open and out walks Liza Green
Everyone is smiling to the point of tears

NATE
They were on a date

GRACE
It was like their 5th one

MASON
Yeah and as soon as she sits down
dude just goes beat red so
embarrassed

GRACE
(to Jessica)
It was so cute

MASON
It was so fucking cute I almost
pissed my pants

GRACE
Oh Jess they look so happy
together

MASON

So happy And there she is-

BOOM The door from the unit flies open and Sammy comes
running out in his underwear holding his big American flag
over his head screaming at the top of his lungs

SAMMY
YOOOOHOOOOOOOO

GRACE
Here we go

Grace takes off after him Mason Jessica and Nate try to
keep up

Grace leads hair blowing as she runs gaining speed with
every step

As she does the sound of the wind grows louder rushing past

her ears slowly drowning out all other sounds until all she
can hear is the wind against her face

FADE TO BLACK
