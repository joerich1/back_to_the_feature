CO-MOTHERFUCKING-CAINE

Mountains of the shit as far as the eye can see loom over
dozens of scurrying SOUTH AMERICAN COCAINE FACTORY WORKERS in
a giant warehousecocaine factory They weigh it cut it
package it etc as they navigate the narrow walkways between
the massive mounds PS They’re all carrying machine guns

From a perch high above the workers in a plush office with
big screen TVs a fat South American COCAINE KINGPIN keeps a
proud but watchful gaze over his empire With him is a SLEEZY
AMERICAN DRUG BUYER

COCAINE KINGPIN
As you can see my operation is
large enough to meet any demand

SLEEZY AMERICAN DRUG BUYER
But large isn’t always good Too
many people under you How do
you know they’re all loyal

The Cocaine Kingpin’s scowl might as well turn into a boot
that kicks the Sleezy American Drug Buyer right in the nuts
but instead he reigns it in and it turns into a knowing
smile

COCAINE KINGPIN
Loyalty my friend is something
you Americans know little about
and that’s why you always
question it

The Cocaine Kingpin snaps his fingers

COCAINE KINGPIN
Juan Carlos

JUAN CARLOS a henchman appears immediately beside his boss
COCAINE KINGPIN
Juan Carlos our American friend
here needs to understand loyalty
Give me your arm

JUAN CARLOS
Si
Juan Carlos rolls up his shirt sleeve and holds his bare arm
out

The Cocaine Kingpin takes out a Zippo lighter

COCAINE KINGPIN
This my friend is loyalty

The Cocaine Kingpin lights the lighter under Juan Carlos’
arm The pain is intense but Juan Carlos endures it for a
few beats his flesh blistering

COCAINE KINGPIN
So is this

The Cocaine Kingpin kicks Juan Carlos in the nuts and he
doesn’t move - he just takes the pain

COCAINE KINGPIN
So is this

The Cocaine Kingpin pulls out a nutcracker and breaks one of
Juan Carlos’ fingers but he doesn’t budge

COCAINE KINGPIN
So is this

The Cocaine Kingpin takes out a baseball bat and smashes Jaun
Carlos in the head but he doesn’t move because his loyalty is
so goddamned intense

COCAINE KINGPIN
So is this

The Cocaine Kingpin takes out a Turkey Baster-

SLEEZY AMERICAN DRUG BUYER
Okay I get it He’s loyal

COCAINE KINGPIN
Really You don’t want to see the
Turkey baster
SLEEZY AMERICAN DRUG BUYER
You’ve proven your point

COCAINE KINGPIN
Okay If you say so Thank you
Juan Carlos That will be all

Juan Carlos grimaces in pain and hobbles off

SLEEZY AMERICAN DRUG BUYER
Your facility is more than
impressive If you can handle the
order Id like to buy 20000
kilos

Across the Cocaine Factory a door busts open

Standing there almost too impressive to even be framed by
the doorway backlit by the golden sunshine of South America
pouring in from outside wearing a permanent five o’clock
shadow skin tight jeans a black leather jacket mirrored
shades and a chewing on a toothpick is your main character

CLOSE ON - DAN MINTNER BADASS FOR HIRE

In a voice tougher than nails dry-humping on a bed of
sandpaper

DAN MINTNER
The only thing you’re buying is a
one way ticket to hell
douchebag

From it’s comfortable home tucked down the front of his
jeans Dan whips out Louise a massive 50 Caliber Desert
Eagle hand cannon

His mastery of the weapon is so complete that you almost
can’t even see him raise the gun and fire a single bullet
that travels all the way across the warehouse to find its
home in the Sleezy American Drug Buyer’s fat head

As his body slumps over blood trickling out of the fresh
bullet wound between his eyes the Cocaine Kingpin unleashes
his fury

COCAINE KINGPIN
Kill him
DAN MINTNER
Kill these nuts

Dan spits out his toothpick to show he means business and we
go into super-slow motion as he pulls Thelma a matching 50
caliber Desert Eagle hand cannon from where it’s tucked in
the back of his pants

What follows is a ballet of death and destruction so
beautifully choreographed it will bring a fucking tear to
your eye

2 guns blazing Dan dives rolls jumps slides sprints
squats lunges etc all over the warehouse laying waste to
any Cocaine Factory Workers in his path

He seems to dance around their bullets as Thelma and Louise
spit lead death spraying the pure white cocaine with the
dirty red blood of the Factory Workers

In his office the Cocaine Kingpin can’t believe his eyes How
can one man be destroying his entire operation

COCAINE KINGPIN
It’s like he’s a one man army

He hurries off in anger toward a giant locker in his office
opens it and removes an M-16 with overunder grenade
launchers

He returns to his perch overlooking the whole place cocks
the grenade launcher and lets one fly

As Dan drops another Cocaine Factory Worker by shooting both
of his eyes out simultaneously (one with each of his two dual-
wielded guns) the grenade explodes beside him sending him

into a giant mound of Cocaine

The mound is serving as cover while Dan regains his
composure but it looks like he’s getting pinned down The
sheer numbers of Factory Workers are too much too handle

COCAINE KINGPIN
Come out come out whereever you
are

The Cocaine Kingpin laughs and then launches another grenade
in Dan’s general direction
It explodes sending debris everywhere but Dan seems safe at
least momentarily behind the giant mound of drugs

A bullet whizzes by him grazing his forehead and opening a
small wound Dan looks up to see a Factory Worker who made
his way behind the mound his gun still smoking

DAN MINTNER
That was a mistake

Dan shoots him in the nuts then in the head He falls over
dead

Dan reaches up to the wound on his head sees he’s bleeding
then jams his hand into the pile of cocaine he’s sitting in
and rubs a healthy amount of the drug into his wound

It takes a beat or two to kick in but once it does Dan
stands up lets out a battle cry and charges out from behind
the cocaine mound

The Cocaine Kingpin sees him and starts firing grenades and
bullets as fast as he can

Dan deftly dodges bullets and explosions while he blasts the
crap out of anyone he sees as he heads straight for the
stairs that lead up to the Cocaine Kingpin

By the time Dan reaches his goal the entire warehouse is on
fire and everyone in the place is dead except Juan Carlos and
the Kingpin himself

Dan comes to stand before them one gun drawn on each of them
as they both have their weapons trained on him as well

The Cocaine Kingpin pulls down on his trigger but there’s
only the dry click of an empty magazine

COCAINE KINGPIN
Juan Carlos why do you hesitate
Kill him

DAN MINTNER
He hesitates because he just saw
me kill about 500 of his buddies
and he’s wondering why I havent
killed him yet Isn’t that right
Juan Carlos
JUAN CARLOS
Si

DAN MINTNER
It might be because I need
someone alive to leave this place
and tell the other dope pushers
that their game is over It won’t
be tolerated anymore Can you do
that for me Juan Carlos

JUAN CARLOS
What will happen to him

Juan Carlos looks at his boss the Kingpin

DAN MINTNER
Only Satan can answer that
question

COCAINE KINGPIN
If you leave me here mark my
words I will hunt you down and
kill you myself

JUAN CARLOS
You know I was okay with the
lighter and the baseball bat and
all the other stuff but the
turkey baster That was just
being an asshole

Juan Carlos unstraps his machine gun lays it down and walks
away

COCAINE KINGPIN
You’re a dead man Juan Carlos

Juan Carlos just keeps walking
DAN MINTNER
Then I guess you two have

something in common

COCAINE KINGPIN
Who sent you

DAN MINTNER
Can’t tell you that
COCAINE KINGPIN
If you’re going to kill me why
can’t you tell me

DAN MINTNER
That’s a fair point The ATF

COCAINE KINGPIN
Why are you doing this

DAN MINTNER
The question you should be asking
is who are my friends to which I
would answer Thelma-

Dan shoots him in his left knee with the gun in his left
hand

DAN MINTNER
-and Louise

Dan shoots him in his right knee with the gun in his right
hand

The Kingpin falls to the ground writhing in intense pain

COCAINE KINGPIN
Who are you

DAN MINTNER
I’m Dan Minter

Dan flips a business card out and we follow it as it spins
toward the Kingpin’s forehead where it lands and we get a
beat to read it

DAN MINTER BADASS FOR HIRE

DAN MINTNER
Badass for hire

Before Dan fires a single bullet through the center of the
business card and through the Kingpin’s skull

While his guns still smoke we travel through the bullet hole
in the Kingpin’s head to begin the most glorious title
sequence in the history of cinema

INT BOARDROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

A fist slams down on a giant table Whoever this fist belongs
to means business and that person is CHARLES WINTHROP a
silver fox if ever there was one in his early 50’s and
clearly the alpha dog in this high powered business meeting

Winthrop stands in front of a giant WINTHROP INDUSTRIES logo
at the head of an enormous table seating probably 50
different Business Executives

WINTHROP
Dammit Last quarter profits were
down more than anyone could have
projected and this quarter isn’t
looking much better I’m not
gonna sugarcoat a turd people
Winthrop Industries is in serious
jeopardy

EXECUTIVE 1

WINTHROP

Executive 1 takes his medicine averts his eyes and shuts
the fuck up

WINTHROP

me in an office the size of a
bathroom That was it Now

multinational fortune 200 company

fun but that’s business Every
one in this room will be
responsible for cutting their
department’s costs by 25 Id
rather not have to but if that
means layoffs you have the green
light

Sighs shakings of heads placing of heads in hands deep
breaths etc fill the room

WINTHROP
Listen sometimes when your cock
gets too hard while youre
staring at some broad with big
titties the only way to get rid
of your boner is to punch
yourself right in the dick with
both hands

He stares at his underlings for a beat

WINTHROP

The executives file out All but two VICTORIA WINTHROP mid
20s hot as shit and LARRY SPERMAN mid 40s slimy as shit

INT WINTHROP INDUSTIRES OFFICES BOARDROOM - SAME

stares out the window to the city for a beat then presses an
intercom button

INT PARKING GARAGE - MINUTES LATER

Winthrop walks through the rows of cars lost in thought He
stops at a Lexus fishes some keys out of his pocket and
remotely unlocks the doors

A SHADOWY FIGURE steps out from behind the car next to his

SHADOWY FIGURE
Charles Winthrop

WINTHROP
Yes

SHADOWY FIGURE
Hi

The Shadowy Figure quickly forces a gag in Winthrop’s mouth
and a black bag over his head as several other Shadowy
Figures emerge and wrestle him to the ground

They bind his hands and feet then toss him in the back of a
van and drive away

INT ATF HEADQUARTERS - DAY

Dan Mintner walks into a giant lobby of course wearing his
shades stubble tight ass jeans black leather jacket and
this time chewing on a matchstick Everyone stares at him -
he’s more than out of place - as he waits for an elevator
among men and women in suits and ties

The elevator finally arrives and Dan gets in among some other
people

INT ELEVATOR - SAME

The doors close and we see that the button console represents
36 floors almost all of which seem to be illuminated - it’s
going to be a long ride

Everyone stands in silence for a few beats then there’s a
clearly audible fart released by someone

A few glances but no accusations Everyone remains silent

A beat passes and then the smell hits A few people toward
the front wince as their noses get burned by the stink of a
thousand rotten suns

As the waves of winces and twisted faces get to Mintner his
face remains stone still offering no indication that he can
even smell the blast

Then he takes the match from his mouth in super slow
motion and drags it across his stubble lighting it

He waves the match in the air consuming the fart with it’s
powerful flame

DAN MINTNER
That was my favorite match
Somebodys got some explaining to
do

He looks at the button console The first button that’s
illuminated is floor 16 He looks up to see that they’re just
passing 14

Dan’s hand strikes out like a cobra pulling the emergency
stop

The elevator screeches to a halt jarring everyone inside
DAN MINTNER
Nobody’s getting off this boat
until we find out who’s ass is a
portal to hell

SUIT 1
C’mon man I’m gonna be late for
work

Dan gets right in his fucking face

DAN MINTNER
You’re gonna be late for life
Now who released the shit ghost

SUIT 2
Okay it was me Now can we please
go

DAN MINTNER
We could go if that death cloud
really did come from your ass
but I happen to know that it
didn’t I happen to know that
youre trying to take the blame
for something that wasn’t your
fault I also happen to know by
the pitch and unique pheromone
content of that lung burner that
it could have only come from one
person’s quivering stinkhole

Dan turns around and points to the only WOMAN in the
elevator

DAN MINTNER
Her’s

WOMAN SUIT
Okay it was me Sorry

SUIT 3
(disgusted)
Cathy

WOMAN SUIT
I’m sorry

She starts crying

WOMAN SUIT
Who are you

Dan hands her a business card

DAN MINTNER
Dan Mintner Badass for Hire

Dan reaches over hits the emergency stop button again and
the elevator heaves back into action

INT ATF HEADQUARTERS NARCOTICS FLOOR - MINUTES LATER

The elevator dings and Dan steps out leaving a crying
farting Cathy behind

DAN MINTNER
Eat less broccoli

The doors close and Dan walks down a hallway sporting a sign
that reads Narcotics Investigations

INT NARCOTICS INVESTIGATOR’S OFFICE - SAME
A FAT GUY sits behind a desk Dan walks in a sits down

FAT GUY
Dan Great to see you back in one
piece

DAN MINTNER
Seems to me I’m still a few
pieces short - a hundred and
fifty thousand pieces short if
you get my meaning

FAT GUY
Of course of course

The Fat Guy pulls out a fat envelope and tosses it to Dan He
catches it with one hand slowly sniffs it then shakes his
head

DAN MINTNER
20 dollars light

The Fat Guy laughs

FAT GUY
You know I take money out every
time just to see you do that You
gotta teach me how to do it
someday Dan

DAN MINTNER
No I don’t

The Fat Guy reaches in his desk drawer and pulls out a 20
hands it to Dan

FAT GUY
With the red tape we would have
had to cut through to even open a
case on Jiminez it would have
taken us years Thanks Dan
seriously

DAN MINTNER
No need Thanking me for killing
a scumbag drug dealer is like
thanking a dog for licking his
own balls

Dan stands up and walks out
EXT ATF HEADQUARTERS - DAY

Dan walks into the street to a local news stand He looks
down and something catches his eye - a newspaper with a
picture of Charles Winthrop and a giant headline reading
KIDNAPPED

Dan snatches up the paper visibly upset by the information
and walks off

INTEXT DAN’S TRICKED OUT IROC-Z VARIOUS LOCATIONS - DAY

Cue the Heavy Metal driving music as Dan hops in a super
tricked out Iroc-Z complete with the giant muscle car engine
that sticks up through the hood semi-truck style stack
exhausts a huge iron grill towing wench affixed to the
front bumper etc

Dan drives around town like a man possessed weaving in and
out of traffic narrowly missing small children hitting a
few barrels filled with water in super slow motion for
supreme effect and ultimately pulling up to a cramped
parking spot at his apartment building

3 CHOLOS sit in his spot drinking beer and smoking

He honks his horn a few times and they reluctantly move so he
can park

EXT DAN’S PARKING SPOT - DAY
Dan gets out of his car The Cholos stare him down - mistake

CHOLO 1
What up homes

DAN MINTNER
My name’s not homes

CHOLO 2
Then what is it esse

DAN MINTNER
It’s not esse either

Dan walks up to Cholo 1 gets in his face Cholo 1 blows
smoke in his face

DAN MINTNER
You know that causes cancer

CHOLO 1
What does homes

DAN MINTNER
This

Dan kicks him in the balls as hard as he can Cholo 1
crumples

Before Cholo 1 hits the ground Dan snatches his cigarette
and puts it out on Cholo 2’s forehead

He turns his attention to Cholo 3 who stands shivering with
fright a fresh wet spot in the crotch of his pants

Dan surveys the other two Cholos writhing in pain then walks
away

INT DAN’S APARTMENT - SAME

Dan comes in takes his guns out of his pants and tosses them
on the couch

We see that he has next to nothing in this small apartment -
only what he needs to survive a small kitchen table an old
ratty couch an old shitty TV a fridge a crapper and a
stove

He takes the lid off a big plastic trash can - it’s full of
cash He takes the envelope out of his pocket opens it and
dumps the money he just got into his trash can of cash

He flips on his shitty old TV and walks into the “kitchen”

Winthrops kidnapping is all over the news Dan watches as he
brews himself a cup of coffee

For Dan Mintner this means putting a pot of water on the
stove until it boils then drinking it while popping handfuls
of raw coffee beans into his mouth like milk duds and
crunching on them with a permanent scowl He gets no pleasure
from this

NEWS ANCHOR
Breaking news Charles Winthrop
CEO and founder of Winthrop
Industries is confirmed to have
been kidnapped early this
afternoon A decorated war hero
in Desert Storm Winthrop built
his mega company from nothing
seven years ago to see it become
one of the most profitable of the
last decade The past six months
however have seen significant
drops in the company’s stock
value and experts are estimating
that trend to continue in light
of this recent news so close to
the end of the company’s next
quarter

As the News Anchor delivers her final words we find out that
drinking coffees not about pleasure for Dan its about
getting enough raw caffeine in your veins to believe you can
smash a coffee table with your bare hands which is exactly
what Dan does when his quiet rage builds to a destructive
crescendo as the news cuts to commercial

Dan stands in the coffee table’s broken shards for a few
beats with a far off stare breathing heavily

INT WINTHROP INDUSTIRES OFFICES - DAY

The place is buzzing with cops FBI and frazzled employees
The FBI agents and police talk to the employees taking
statements

We focus in on an FBI Agent taking Larry Sperman’s statement

LARRY SPERMAN
He was just in our boardroom
yesterday telling us all how the
stock was dropping and today he’s
kidnapped

FBI AGENT 1
And you have no idea who might
have done this

LARRY SPERMAN
No all I know is that the stock
is only going to keep dropping
with Mr Winthrop gone

Larry isn’t too disappointed as he says this last bit the
wheels turning behind his shifty eyes

In the same room another FBI Agent takes Victoria’s
statement She’s in tears

VICTORIA
I just I mean who would want to
kidnap my father

FBI AGENT 2
It’s alright Ms Winthrop That’s
the exact question we’re here to
answer

She sobs for a few beats and then

The fucking door is kicked off its hinges and in the doorway
stands Dan Mintner Badass for Hire similar to when he tore
the shit out of the cocaine factory

Dan struts in like he owns the place the cops and FBI
present are too stunned to even approach him for a few beats
Then a ROOKIE FBI AGENT walks up to him

ROOKIE FBI AGENT
Um excuse me sir this is a
crime scene and we’re conducting
an investigation Are you
authorized to be here

DAN MINTNER
Yeah

ROOKIE FBI AGENT
Can I see that authorization

Mintner lowers his shades just barely peeking over them at
this chump

DAN MINTNER
Sure

Dan knees him in the balls sending him to the ground All of
the other FBI Agents in the room draw their guns and aim at
Dan who could care less

DAN MINTNER

Who’s the cheesedick in charge of
this clusterfuck

A gruff black guy named CARTER NIBBS stands up
CARTER NIBBS
That’d be me and who in the hell

DAN MINTNER
Dan Mintner Badass for Hire

Carter laughs

CARTER NIBBS
Get this psycho outta here

Carter turns around Two FBI Agents approach Dan reaching
toward him

DAN MINTNER
What’s your name

Carter turns back around

CARTER NIBBS
Carter Nibbs
DAN MINTNER
Well Carter before your FBI
goons get their hands shoved up
their own asses and then shoved
in their mouths I want to tell
you a little story It goes like
this There was a kid who wanted
a puppy for his birthday So his
parents went to the local shelter
and got him a pit bull with a
scar over his left eye They
locked the pitbull in the
bathroom until morning They were
gonna surprise the kid Turns out
the surprise was all theirs when
that pitbull broke through the
bathroom door with psychotic rage
from being locked up and exacted
his revenge on the parents
Mauled ‘em to death right in
front of the kid then winked at
him with that scarred eye and ran
away into the night So what was
the kid to do The only thing he
could do He ran out into the
night looking for that dog
waiting for the day he could get
his own revenge After 10 long
years on the street that kid
never found the dog but he
became the toughest son of a
bitch on planet Earth

CARTER NIBBS
Is this going anywhere

DAN MINTNER
I was the kid

CARTER
No shit So what

DAN MINTNER
So when I turned 18 I joined the
army Turns out I was so tough
from my years on the streets that
I got recruited for special ops
training

(MORE )

DAN MINTNER (contd)
Also turns out that my commanding
officer was like a father to me
more of a father that my real one
ever was because he was dead for
most of my life It further turns
out that after a few tours in
Desert Storm my CO and I both
came back to the states I found
out I could make a living my
renting out my services to
various clients And my CO
started a little company that
turned into a multi-billion
dollar corporation His name is
Charles Winthrop

CARTER
And

DAN MINTNER
And I’m gonna find whoever took
him and make them pay

CARTER
Just like you made that pitbull
pay

DAN MINTNER
I was a kid asshole I had no
chance of finding that dog But
this time it’s the dog who has no
chance

CARTER
Look Dan I appreciate your
concern here but I’ve handled
over 17 kidnapping cases I’ve
got a full crew of field trained
agents here I think we got it
covered So like Billy said
unless you got authorization
youre gonna have to leave

DAN MINTNER
Fine Here’s your authorization

Dan whips out his authorization - a stack of various badges
and medals identifying him as former CIA FBI NYPD NYFD
Army Ranger Navy Seal Medal of Honor recipient Bronze Star
recipient etc Carter looks at them all in astonishment

CARTER
CIA FBI NYPD NYFD Army
Ranger Navy Seal a fucking
Bronze Star

DAN MINTNER
3 Bronze Stars

CARTER
How did you

DAN MINTNER
How didn’t I Nibbs no one in
this room is more authorized than
me

CARTER
Actually despite your collection
of ID’s and medals everyone in
this room is more authorized than
you Get him outta here

Nibbs dismisses him and two FBI Agents move to escort Dan
out

DAN MINTNER
One question Nibbs

Nibbs turns around annoyed

CARTER
What

DAN MINTNER
Which floor was Winthrop’s car
on

CARTER
Not that it’s any business of
yours but the 35th Now get
outta here and can somebody make
sure he doesn’t get on the
elevators

Nibbs turns around back to work as Dan promptly escorted
out of the scene by some FBI Agents

As Dan’s being dragged out

DAN MINTNER
You can take me out of this room
but you can’t take me off this
case

INT PARKING STRUCTURECRIME SCENE - MINUTES LATER

Yellow tape ropes off the area around Winthrop’s car the
exact spot where he was kidnapped FBI Agents investigate the
crime scene dusting for fingerprints waving black lights
over everything etc

INT STAIRWELL - SIMULTANEOUS

Dan sprints up the stairs passing the 34th floor without
even breaking a sweat He hits the 35th and of course kicks
open the door

INT PARKING STRUCTURECRIME SCENE - SAME

Just as we’ve seen a few times before Dan stands defiant in
the doorway staring at a bunch of FBI Agents chewing on a
toothpick

A SCRAWNY FBI AGENT approaches Dan

SCRAWNY FBI AGENT

DAN MINTNER
Looks to me like I’m doing your
job for you asshole

SCRAWNY FBI AGENT
Does agent Nibbs know you’re
here

DAN MINTNER
He’s the one that sent me

The Scrawny FBI Agent thinks about it accepts Dan’s answer
and wanders off

Dan walks among the FBI Agents with a permanent scowl He
knows they have no clue what they’re doing

He moves over to Winthrop’s car sees Victoria talking to a
FAT FBI AGENT
The Fat FBI

FAT FBI AGENT
So he bought this car a few
months ago

VICTORIA

a father to me And as long as I
have a breath left in my lungs
I‘1l hold it until I find him

VICTORIA
I appreciate that Thank you

It’s clear there is some attraction here

DAN MINTNER
Thanking me for nailing the
bastards who took your father is
like thanking a kid with down
syndrome for being super strong
or for jerking off in public

Dan looks over and sees Larry Sperman

DAN MINTNER
Who’s that guy

VICTORIA
His name’s Larry Sperman He’s my
father’s right hand man
basically - runs all the day to
day operations at Winthrop
Industries and has made it pretty
clear that he’s going to try to
take over the company when my
father retires

DAN MINTNER
You don’t say

Dan walks over to Larry
DAN MINTNER

You don’t seem to busted up about
the old man being kidnapped

LARRY SPERMAN

Just because I don’t break down
into tears doesn’t mean I’m not
very worried about Mr Winthrop
In his absence I have a multi-
billion dollar company to run so
youll have to excuse me if I’m
trying to remain as calm as
possible through this whole
ordeal

DAN MINTNER
Excuses are like kicks to the
balls - easy to dish out hard to
take

Larry looks at him for a beat confused

LARRY SPERMAN
Well I should be getting back to
the office now

Larry leaves Dan scowls obviously feeling some
towards Larry

VICTORIA
Do you really think you can find
my father

DAN MINTNER
Well let’s take a look

hostility

Dan looks the car over gets on his hands and knees looks
under the car unscrews the gas cap takes a deep whiff from
the gas tank and another stands up looks around for a few
beats

DAN MINTNER
Something’s not right here

VICTORIA
What Did you find something

DAN MINTNER
Not exactly

Dan walks up to a CHINESE FBI AGENT then he points at a spot
on the floor

DAN MINTNER
You see that Fed

The Chinese FBI agent looks down at the spot Dan is
indicating

CHINESE FBI AGENT
No There’s nothing there

DAN MINTNER
Looks like all that training at
the academy really paid off

CHINESE FBI AGENT
What are you saying

DAN MINTNER
You already said it - there’s
nothing there That doesn’t
strike you as odd The CEO of one
of the most powerful companies in
the world disappears in broad
daylight and there’s not one
trace of evidence

The Chinese FBI Agent blinks at Dan
DAN MINTNER

Jesus Christ get your boss up
here pronto flatfoot
INT ELEVATOR - MINUTES LATER
Carter Nibbs rides up with the Chinese FBI Agent

CARTER NIBBS
I thought I told you to keep that
lunatic out of here

CHINESE FBI AGENT
I’m sorry sir We weren’t aware
of your orders

CARTER NIBBS
They really don’t pay me enough

INT PARKING STRUCTURECRIME SCENE - MINUTES LATER
Carter enters the scene with the Chinese FBI Agent

Dan stands in the middle of a big open space all the
Agents surround him as though he’s holding court

CARTER NIBBS
What in the hell are you people
doing Get this guy outta here

DAN MINTNER
Wait Your men have been pouring
over this crime scene for the
past five hours and I’ve managed
to find the only clue there is in
about 5 minutes so I think you
should listen to me

CARTER NIBBS
You got 30 seconds

Dan holds his watch up looks at it for a few beats
It beeps as he hits a button to start a timer

DAN MINTNER
And go Look around notice
anything strange

CARTER NIBBS
Yeah there’s a guy in jeans so
tight I can count the veins in
his junk standing in the middle
of my crime scene

FBI

DAN MINTNER
There are no clues Nothing left
behind To pull off a kidnapping
and not leave behind a skid mark
scuffs from shoes not so much as
a single god damned hair - well
there are only a few people on
this planet who could have done
something like that and they had
to have had very specific
military training

Dan’s watch beeps again time’s up

Nibbs looks at him like he’s an idiot They stare at each
other for a beat

CARTER NIBBS
Was that 30 seconds

DAN MINTNER
No that was the sound of
realization hitting your brain
douchebag Also it was 30
seconds

CARTER NIBBS
So based on your expert analysis
of the crime scene the only
person who might have had the
skills to kidnap Winthrop that
I’ve encountered in the last 24
hours is you Your crack
investigative skills put you as
suspect number one

DAN MINTNER
You don’t get it

CARTER NIBBS
I get it just fine You want to
help us find your old war buddy
that’s great but you’re a crazy
ass motherfucker who’s just
getting in the way I appreciate
the effort I really do but lack
of evidence is just that You’re
reading too much into this and
once again you’re wasting my
valuable time

(MORE )

CARTER NIBBS (contd)
So please get the hell out of
here before I have you arrested
for hindering a federal
investigation

VICTORIA
I’‘1l escort him out Mr Nibbs

Nibbs shoots her s surprised look
CARTER NIBBS
Would you like an Agent to help

you

VICTORIA
No I can handle it

CARTER NIBBS
I really don’ think that’s safe
given the circumstances of the
kidnapping and the fact that-

VICTORIA
I said I can handle it

Nibbs backs down in the face of Victoria’s assertiveness

CARTER NIBBS
Suit yourself

EXT WINTHROP INDUSTIRES OFFICES - DAY
Dan and Victoria stand in front of the building

VICTORIA
Listen Dan for some reason I
trust you and I think that of all
the people looking for my father
you might be the only one who
wants him back as much as I do
So if you need any help please
let me know I know Agent Nibbs
has experience with kidnappings
but I want to know that I’m doing
everything I can to get my father
back

DAN MINTNER
Based on the Feds uncanny ability
to overlook blatant clues at the
crime scene they’ve probably
overlooked things all over the
building Can you get me into
your father’s office

VICTORIA
Not during the day If Agent
Nibbs sees you back here he’1l
have you arrested But tonight
they should all be gone

DAN MINTNER
See you at

Dan looks at his watch
Close on the watch as Dan initiates a countdown timer

DAN MINTNER
-10 Go

Dan hurries off into the street leaving Victoria to watch him
longingly

We pan up so the giant Winthrop Industries building against
the blue daytime sky is all that fills the frame The sun
goes down and the moon comes up as night falls

INT WINTHROP INDUSTIRES OFFICES - NIGHT

Dan and Victoria stand outside an office with Charles
Winthrop’s name stenciled into the giant glass door

Dan watch beeps - it’s 1000

DAN MINTNER
Go go go

Victoria looks at him like he’s insane then nonchalantly
pulls out a key and opens the door

Dan hustles in like he’s storming an enemy base

Victoria follows shaking her head What has she gotten
herself into

INT WINTHROP’S OFFICE - SAME
It’s a huge office fitting for the company’s founderCEO
Dan looks around

VICTORIA
How well did you know my father

DAN MINTNER
Better than anyone when we were
in Desert Storm We lost contact
over the years but I still
consider him the closest thing to
a father I ever had How well do
YOU know your father

VICTORIA
What

DAN MINTNER
Did he make any new business
acquaintances recently make any
new friends Any new enemies

VICTORIA
No not that I know of

Dan walks over to Winthrop’s desk and picks up a framed
picture It’s Charles and his old special ops crew including
Dan He would smile if he remembered how but instead he
turns the picture so Victoria can see it

DAN MINTNER
I always regretted not staying in
contact with your dad It just
seemed like once we all got back
home we needed to lead our own
lives put the past in the past

VICTORIA
Was it that bad over there My
father never really talked about
it

DAN MINTNER
We mostly killed a lot of guys
with our bare hands We were
special ops we didnt have to
use guns if we didnt want to
(MORE )

DAN MINTNER (contd)
And we also did a lot of
isometric exercises in the hot
sun our taught battle trained
muscles glistening with a thin
and not unattractive layer of
masculine sweat Did your dad
keep in touch with any of the
other guys from our old unit

VICTORIA
If he did he never told me about
it I think he probably felt the
same way as you - let the past be
the past Do you think someone
from your old unit might be
involved

DAN MINTNER
It’ tough to say but after
checking out the crime scene my
gut is telling me it was the work
of this man

Dan points to a guy in the picture

VICTORIA
Who is he

DAN MINTNER
Dax Cutter

VICTORIA
Were you friends with him

DAN MINTNER
If by friends you actually mean
enemies then yeah We were best
friends

VICTORIA
What

DAN MINTNER
Cutter was an asshole but a
ruthless asshole who was a master
at dealing with hostages He was
able to extract personnel without
the enemy even knowing he was
there When people weren’t
calling him “asshole” they called
him the Ghost

VICTORIA
Are you going to talk to him or
something

DAN MINTNER
Talk to Dax Cutter Let me tell
you a little story about why Dax
Cutter and I will never speak
again It was our second tour in
Desert Storm There was a special
ops mission that your father was
going to lead and he could only
take one other man with him
Naturally he wanted the toughest
most battle ready soldier at his
side He chose me Dax wasn’t too
happy about that

VICTORIA
What’d he do

CUT TO
EXT DESERT STORM SPECIAL OPS CAMP - DAY

DAX CUTTER picture Van Damme circa Bloodsport or circa now
either way - Van Damme stands shirtless glistening in the
hot sun among several other soldiers

Dan stands near him beside Charles Winthrop

DAX CUTTER
With all do respect Captain I
feel I’m the most qualified
soldier for this mission

WINTHROP
Cutter we’ve been through this
It’s a two man mission I need
the toughest guy here to go with
me You’re great at what you do
but the toughest guy is Mintner

DAX CUTTER
How do you know that

WINTHROP
Alright Cutter if you can prove
to me you’re tougher than Mintner
the mission’s yours Mintner you
up for a little challenge

DAN MINTNER
Always sir What’‘ll it be
Cutter Bareknuckles kali
fighting sticks combat daggers

DAX CUTTER
Naked fire ant pushups

Cutter points to two large fire ant mounds crawling with
fire ants a few feet away Everyone gasps

Dan is nonplussed
CUT TO
EXT DESERT STORM SPECIAL OPS CAMP - DAY

The special ops soldiers including Winthrop form a circle
around two naked men Cutter and Dan each of whom have their
genital regions positioned directly over the fire ant mounds

DAN MINTNER
Cutter I know you want this
mission but you can’t handle
this

DAX CUTTER
Shut up

WINTHROP
Alright we go until one of you
bows out Ready Down

Both men lower themselves into the fire ant mounds Dax
Cutter cringes in pain as the ants are obviously biting his
junk

Dan doesn’t even blink or maybe he does it’s hard to tell
behind his aviator shades

WINTHROP
Up

The two men push up

SPECIAL OPS SOLDIER 1
Holy crap there’s ants comin’
outta their peeholes
Special Ops Soldier 1 vomits

WINTHROP
Down

They go down again Dax cringes

DAX CUTTER
Ahhhhh

Dan laughs to himself

WINTHROP

Up

They push back up

WINTHROP

Cutter do you want to continue
DAX CUTTER

(through gritted teeth)

Yes sir
WINTHROP

Down

They go back down Cutter can’t take it he rolls off the
fire ant mound screaming in pain

Winthrop gets a good look at his genitals

WINTHROP
Dear god Medic

Cutter looks over at Dan through tears Dan smiles at him

DAN MINTNER
Nice try Cutter

Dan does ten more pushup just for good measure as a MEDIC
tends to Cutter’s mangled genitals

CUT TO

INT WINTHROP’S OFFICE - NIGHT
Victoria is hanging on Dan’s every word

DAN MINTNER
Cutter had to spend two weeks in
the infirmary and after the
swelling went down he was left
impotent for life

VICTORIA
What about you

DAN MINTNER
The swelling never went down

Victoria’s chest heaves as lust flows through her veins

DAN MINTNER
Cutter was never the same after
that He never forgave me or your
dad And based on the lack of any
trace of the kidnappers at the
crime scene I’d say it’s a fair
bet he’s involved somehow

Dan punches the table

DAN MINTNER
There’s got to be something more
here something I’ve missed

Dan walks over to a flat screen TV hanging on the wall and
puts his foot through it

VICTORIA
What are you doing

DAN MINTNER
Looking for clues

Dan turns into a human wrecking ball as he tears the place
apart smashing the desk demolishing computers punching
holes in the walls and even throwing a chair through the
window His rage finally subsides when Victoria begs him to
stop his insanity

He collapses breathing hard spent from his frenzy of
destruction

Victoria sits down next to him

VICTORIA
Why did you do that

DAN MINTNER
I’m sorry the only way I know
how to put something back
together is to tear it apart

She leans close to him Dan grabs her by the back of the hair
and pulls her into his mouth kissing her like she’s always
dreamed she would kissed and never letting the toothpick fall
out of his mouth

He pulls her face away from his giving him enough space to
talk

DAN MINTNER
If Cutter or anyone from our old
squad is involved I’1l get your
father back I promise

He kisses her again and gets a boner
INT NIBBS OFFICE - DAY

Nibbs stands in front of a giant whiteboard that has three
photos taped to it Winthrop Victoria and Larry Sperman
Lines are drawn between them indicating their relationships
with one another Phrases like “Who kidnapped Winthrop” And
“Who could have possibly kidnapped Winthrop” are on the
board as well but there is clearly no lead

He stares at it

Dan walks into his office unnoticed He walks up behind
Nibbs

DAN MINTNER
Looks like you’ve really got this
thing cracked wide open

Nibbs turns around
CARTER NIBBS

Jesus fucking Christ What in the
hell are you doing here

DAN MINTNER
I came because I need your help
but it looks like you’re the one
who might need mine

CARTER NIBBS
Lay off a kidnapping case is
hard enough by itself but when
you haven’t gotten a ransom
demand especially with a victim
who’s worth as much as Charles
Winthrop well it’s near
impossible How did you even get
in here Security

DAN MINTNER
Look I think I’ve found
something that you might have
overlooked and I need to use your
resources to track some people
down

CARTER NIBBS
Absolutely not This is a federal
case So unless you graduated
from Quantico since the last time
I saw you get the hell out of
here and leave this case to us

DAN MINTNER
Fine Play it your way chief But
if you won’t help me I’m going
to have to use my own sources and
things could get messy

CARTER NIBBS
Only mess around here is going to
be in your pants when I beat you
so bad you become incontinent
Now get out

Dan leaves Carter’s office
DAN MINTNER

(to himself)
No ransom demand

EXT ROADHOUSE BAR - NIGHT

A GIANT BLACK GUY is the door bouncer at a rowdy roadhouse
bar

A GNARLY LOOKING BIKER approaches the door tries to walk in
The Giant Black Guy sticks his mammoth arm out blocking the
Gnarly Looking Biker

GNARLY LOOKING BIKER
You got a problem there

GIANT BLACK GUY
ID please

GNARLY LOOKING BIKER

What

GIANT BLACK GUY
ID please

GNARLY LOOKING BIKER
Do I look like I’m under 21

GIANT BLACK GUY
If you want through this door I
have to see some ID

GNARLY LOOKING BIKER
Here’s your ID

The Gnarly Looking Biker flips the Giant Black Guy off

GIANT BLACK GUY
That’s a mistake

The Giant Black guy takes the Gnarly Looking Biker’s middle
fingers and breaks them in a matter of seconds As the Gnarly
Looking Biker screams in pain the Giant Black Guy kicks him
in the stomach nuts throat and face Then he picks him up
and does an atomic head spin that finds the Gnarly Looking
Biker flying through the air

His limp body falls at the feet of Dan Mintner who just
witnessed the whole event Dan chews on a matchstick
nonplussed as usual

Dan steps over the limp Gnarly Looking Biker’s body and makes
his way up to the Giant Black Guy

GIANT BLACK GUY

DAN MINTNER
Well I got two forms - my ass or
my balls Which one you want

The Giant Black Guy’s rage is visible Dan readies himself as
the two posture up for the fight of the century

Then The Giant Black guy cracks a giant toothy smile

GIANT BLACK GUY
Dan Minter you crazy son of a
bitch

The two guys give one another a forearm handshake
(reference Arnold and Carl Weathers first meeting in
Predator)

DAN MINTNER
How you been Hulk

HULK
Same old shit brother same old
shit How about you

DAN MINTNER
Keeping busy You hear about
Captain Winthrop

HULK
Yeah yeah That’s some
motherfuckin’ bullshit

DAN MINTNER
You got a few minutes to talk

HULK
Sure sure Billy Billy

Another bouncer turns around and looks at Hulk
HULK
I’m grabbing a drink real quick

Watch the front

Billy nods as Dan and Hulk head into the bar
INT ROADHOUSE BAR - SAME

Much like outside the bar is full of bikers gang members

skanky sluts and seedy characters of all types

Dan and Hulk sit down at the bar The BARTENDER serves them

up two beers

HULK
(to Bartender )
Thanks Dutch (to Dan) I gotta
say Dan after we left that
hellhole I never thought I’d see
your ugly ass again So what’s
up

DAN MINTNER
The FBI has their collective head
so far up its collective asshole
it can taste what it collectively
ate for it’s collective breakfast
on Captain Winthrop’s kidnapping
case

HULK
That’s a shame A real shame but
why’re you here

DAN MINTNER
Hulk I’m looking for Winthrop on
my own and I thought I’d start
checking with anyone who might
know anything

HULK
What in the hell could I possibly
know

DAN MINTNER
I checked out the crime scene and
my gut told me that Cutter might
be involved

HULK
Dax Cutter

DAN MINTNER
Yeah Have you seen him recently
HULK
No Not since the good old days
Sorry I can’t be of more help

DAN MINTNER
Well what about working at a
place like this I assume you
know what’s happening in the
streets You picked up anything
weird going down in terms of
kidnappings or anything

HULK
Now that you mention it There
has been a new crew that hangs
out in here sometimes Nobody
knows whos leading the crew but
theyre pros They have financing
and they cover their tracks very
well

DAN MINTNER
Like I said I suspected there
might be some kind of ex-military
involvement Those are pretty
tell-tale signs I might be right

HULK
This crew puts on a high stakes
cage matche every Friday night
down at the docks

DAN MINTNER
Interesting

Dan pounds his entire beer

DAN MINTNER
Well thanks for the info Hulk
You take care of yourself

HULK
You too Dan

As Dans stands up to leave the beginnings of a scuffle
erupt between two other bar patrons

DRUNKEN BEARDED BIKER
For the last time I do not sniff
my fingers after I piss
44

DRUNKEN TATTOOED BIKER
I saw you do it

The Drunken Bearded Biker shatters his beer bottle on his own
head

DRUNKEN BEARDED BIKER
Is wadn’t me

DRUNKEN TATTOOED BIKER
Twas too

The Drunken Tattooed Biker tackles the Drunken Bearded Biker
Hulk looks at Dan

HULK
For old times sake

DAN MINTNER
What the hell

As the scuffle between the two Drunken Bikers starts to
spread to a bar-wide melee Dan and Hulk rush in

What follows is cinema’s most glorious bar fight Dan and
Hulk put on a badass clinic as they smash pool sticks over
bar patrons’ heads smash tables punch holes through
everything drink beer while fighting throw knives into
patron’s hands sticking them to walls just before they’re
about to throw a punch blind patrons with crushed up bar
peanut shells kick patrons in the balls and tits etc

At one point a patron knocks over a kerosine lamp catching
some drapes on fire adding a new dimension to the fight

As the fight continues the entire place starts to go up in
flames

Some patrons throw water on the blaze but at this point the
inferno is too intense to contain

Dan looks over to Hulk who tosses limp Biker onto a pile of
other limp Bikers

DAN MINTNER
We should get outta here

HULK
Guess so

Dan and Hulk walk out of the bar leaving the unconscious
Bikers inside As Dan leaves he lights a cigar on a flaming
table

They emerge from the place in super slow motion the flames
from the Roadhouse Bar dying in a conflagration behind them
reflecting in Dan’s aviator shades

After about ten steps or so the Roadhouse Bar explodes in
what looks like a nuclear explosion Hulk ducks for cover
pieces of burning building flying past him Dan doesn’t even
break his stride basking in the warm radiation

What a fucking badass
EXT THE DOCKS - NIGHT

The Docks are abuzz with various nefarious denizens of the
criminal underworld as a giant UFC style mixed martial arts
cage is being set up by a team of thugs

In the crowd a BOOKIE takes bets from almost everyone on the
upcoming fight

Dan and Victoria are perched on a rooftop of a building on
the docks watching through binoculars

DAN MINTNER
I still don’t think it’s a good
idea for you to be here

VICTORIA
If you think these people might
have my father then there’s no
way you could have kept me from
coming Besides two sets of eyes
are better than one

Dan shoots her a look that says “dammit you’re right” He
looks back through his binoculars for a beat

VICTORIA
So I’ve been meaning to ask you
this since we first met What
exactly is a badass for hire I
Mean how did you get started in
that line of work

DAN MINTNER
When I came back from the war I
never knew how different life in
the real world was I tried to
fit in tried to lead a normal
life but after so many years of
kicking people’s asses for a
living and just being generally
tough

CUT TO
INT STARBUCKS COFFEE - DAY

Dan wearing his shades chewing on his matchstick but also
wearing a Starbucks employee outfit stands behind the
counter

An ANGRY STARBUCKS PATRON approaches him with a drink in hand

ANGRY STARBUCKS PATRON

(with flamboyant attitude)
Um I ordered a half-caf double
mocha latte and this is a half-
caf double mocha chino Fix it

Dan takes the drink looks at it

DAN MINTNER
Fuck you Drink it

Dan Thrusts the burrito back at the Angry Starbucks Patron

ANGRY STARBUCKS PATRON
Um excuse me

DAN MINTNER
I didn’t rack up over 350
confirmed kills fighting for this
country’s liberty to have some
asshole tell me I didn’t make his
drink faggy enough for him So
drink the fucking thing

Dan jumps across the counter and forces the drink down the
Angry Starbucks Patron’s throat

DAN MINTNER (VO)
It seemed like every job I tried
just didn’t fit

EXT CAR DEALERSHIP - DAY
Dan smashes a guy’s head into the hood of a car

DAN MINTNER
Get out your fucking checkbook

INT GRADESCHOOL CLASSROOM - DAY

Dan sits in a chair in front of a bunch of little kids
reading a book

DAN MINTNER
And the pokey little puppy lived
happily ever after

Dan takes a beat to think

DAN MINTNER
What a crock of shit

LITTLE KID
Om You said a bad word I’m
telling

DAN MINTNER
No you’re not

Dan jumps out of his chair and puts the Little Kid in a head
lock

CUT TO
EXT DOCK - NIGHT
We’re back with Dan and Victoria on the roof

DAN MINTNER
And then one day I realized I
should just stick with doing what
I do best - kicking ass So I
started auctioning off my
services to the highest bidder
ATF and CIA when there’s too much
red tape for them to cut through
Other countries who need an
outsider to do the job so they
won’t be linked

(MORE )

DAN MINTNER (contd)
Even private parties who aren’t
getting the kind of service they
should be from the cops or the
feds

VICTORIA
So youre like a mercenary

DAN MINTNER
I’m a badass for hire Says so
right there

He flips her a business card

DAN MINTNER
And it’s time to put my skills to
the test

EXT DOCKS - MINUTES LATER
Dan and Victoria approach the throng of people

DAN MINTNER
Stay here don’t raise any
suspicion I’m gonna go drop a
bet see if I can figure anything
out

Dan disappears into the throng leaving Victoria by herself

Dan wades through the crowd to make his way to a Bookie
taking bets from various people

DAN MINTNER
Gimme 5 on whoever the underdog
is

Dan reaches in his jean jacket pocket and pulls out a wad of
5000 dollars hands it to the guy

As he does he sees something in the shadows beyond the crowd
Two men are escorting a third whose hands are bound and who
wears a black hood over his head hostage style

Dan looks back at Victoria who sees him He gives her a few
quick military hand signals indicating that he’s discovered
something and is going to go check it out (these include
pointing at his own eyes with two fingers waving his hand in
a circle and making a fist etc)

Dan moves into the shadows toward the area he saw the men in

Dan trails them for a few seconds and sees that theyre
loading the hooded person onto a cargo ship Then wham hes
hit on the back of the head and rendered unconscious

CUT TO BLACK
INT DOCK OFFICE - MINUTES LATER

We come out of the black to see the sinister face of an ASIAN
CRIME BOSS smiling down at the groggy Dan Mintner as he wakes

up

ASIAN CRIME BOSS
Are you cop I don’t like cop
screwing with my business

DAN MINTNER
I’m not a cop

ASIAN CRIME BOSS
Then why you here

DAN MINTNER
I just wanted to check out the
show put some money down

The Asian Crime Boss whips out the wad of 5000 dollars that
Dan gave to the bookie and tosses it at Dan

ASIAN CRIME BOSS
5000 dollar a lot of money for
cop

DAN MINTNER
I told you I’m not a cop

ASIAN CRIME BOSS
It doesn’t matter Cop not cop
I don’t like you and I don’t want
you screwing with my business So
now you going to learn hard way

DAN MINTNER
What in the hell are you talking
about chinaman

ASIAN CRIME BOSS
I’m Korean

DAN MINTNER
Sorry What in the hell are you
talking about nip

ASIAN CRIME BOSS
Nip is Japanese asshole I will
enjoy this even more The reason
I give you your bet back is that
we do not allow fighters to bet
on their own fights

DAN MINTNER
But I’m not fighting

ASIAN CRIME BOSS
Yes Mr cop asshole you are

The Asian Crime Boss barks something in Korean and two KOREAN
BODYGUARDS drag Dan away

INT CAGE - MINUTES LATER

The two Korean Bodyguards toss Dan into the big mixed martial
arts Cage we saw earlier and lock the door behind him Dan
takes few seconds to get to his feet before he looks across
the cage and sees his opponent - 7’4” HONG MAN CHOI (A real
mixed martial arts fighter from Korea Look this guy up on
youtube he is a literal giant)

Hong Man Choi looks like a lion at the zoo who just had some
raw meat thrown in his cage

Dan looks out into the crowd and sees Victoria through the
cage who is just as surprised to see him there as he is to be
there

DAN MINTNER
(yelling out to Victoria)
I think they have your father

VICTORIA
What

DAN MINTNER
I saw them with a prisoner back
there loading him onto a ship

He points in the direction he saw the hostage

A BELL sounds

VICTORIA
What

DAN MINTNER
I said-

His sentence is cut short by Hong Man Choi’s anvil size fist
as it crushes Dan’s face sending him to the mat

As the ravenous crowd cheers Dan wipes the blood off his
chin stands up and spits the matchstick out of his mouth
Holy shit he means fucking serious business

Hong Man Choi smiles as Dan takes off his jean jacket and
postures up for some serious asskicking

Dan charges Hong Man Choi and tries to get some shots in but
he’s just too big It’s like a little kid trying to fight his
much older brother

Hong Man Choi kicks him and Dan flies across the ring The
crowd goes nuts

As he regains some composure Dan looks up and sees that
there are some lights set up all around the cage He also
notices that just outside the cage are a group of oil drums

Dan looks across at Hong Man Choi who’s moving in for the
kill He feigns injury acts like he can’t get up off the
ground further enticing Hong Man Choi

Hong Man Choi takes two steps and he’s already across the
cage He lifts up one leg preparing to do a final face stomp
that will end Dan’s life

Dan waits until his foot is at its apex then unleashes a
devastating double punch right to Hong Man Choi’s balls The
strike freezes Hong Man Choi in transcendental pain his body
becoming an immobile statue in the cage

Dan seizes his opportunity climbing up the frozen Hong Man
Choi like a jungle gym Hong Man Choi’s incredible height
allows Dan to climb to his head and jump off it high enough
to reach one of the lights illuminating the cage

Dan climbs onto the light and starts rocking it back and
forth Then like Indiana Jones Dan is able to tip the light
over and ride it down toward the oil drums

He leaps off the light just in time as it crashes into the
oil drums and ignites them resulting in a huge explosion

The crowd scatters fearing for their lives Hong Man Choi
remains motionless frozen in pain in the middle of the
cage

INT DOCK OFFICE - SAME
The Asian Crime Boss is not happy

ASIAN CRIME BOSS
What is he doing He’s ruining
everything Stop him

EXT DOCK -— SAME

The Asian Crime Boss’ command is too late The initial oil
drum explosion sets off a chain reaction and hundreds of
other explosions rock the docks and destroy the dock office
along with a screaming Asian Crime Boss who’s catches on fire
just before he explodes

Dan hurries into the crowd to get Victoria

VICTORIA
We have to get out of here

DAN MINTNER
Follow me I think I know where
your father is

VICTORIA
(genuinely surprised)
Really
DAN MINTNER
Come on

Dan leads her back through some cargo containers toward the
ship he saw earlier

He picks up a nearby crowbar and pries the lock off the cargo
hull door

As it swings open it’s not Charles Winthrop who’s revealed
but instead a cargo hold full of blindfolded bound and
gagged Asian slaves

DAN MINTNER
Sweet Jesus These aren’t
kidnappers they’re Asian slave
traders

INT NIBBS OFFICE - DAY

Dan slightly charred and battle worn not having had time to
clean up after the explosive outcome of the previous night
sits across from Nibbs who looks like every vein in his neck
is about to explode

Victoria sits next to Dan

CARTER NIBBS
So it looks like you took my
advice to drop the kidnapping
case But somehow you wound up
knee deep in an Asian slave
trading ring that we’ve had
undercover operatives in for
years And you ruined the whole
thing

DAN MINTNER
From behind these shades it
looks a lot like the case you
wasted years on I solved and
closed in one night

CARTER NIBBS
But you didn’t follow protocol
Had any of those slave traders
survived the explosion they’d be
out of jail in 5 seconds

DAN MINTNER
Protocol is for pussies

CARTER NIBBS
You know what Mintner you’re
right Protocol is for pussies
And right now that protocol
dictates that I have you arrested
for all kinds of shit not the
least of which is about 40 counts
of manslaughter

DAN MINTNER
Try it I’d be outta whatever
craphole you put me in about as
fast as I solved your case for
you last night

VICTORIA
Agent Nibbs Dan was just trying
to do everything he could to get
my father back He followed a
lead and instead of finding my
father he freed all of those
Asian slaves Is that really so
bad

CARTER NIBBS
Ms Winthrop I know you want
your father back but hangin’
around with this guy well I have
to tell you it could look very
bad in the press

Dan stands up out of his chair and smashes a fist down on
Nibbs’ desk with such force that it might as well be a
sledgehammer

DAN MINTNER
The press The press can go to
hell The only thing that matters
right now is finding out where
Winthrop is That’s what I was
trying to do when I accidentally
took down the biggest Asian slave
trade crime syndicate in the
western hemisphere and that’s
what I’1ll be trying to do every
second of every day for the rest
of my life until I find him
which is way more than I can say
for you and your precious
“FBI”

Dan flips over Nibbs’ desk spilling coffee all over him and
walks out Victoria follows him

VICTORIA
My father’s company will cover
any damages Sorry

Nibbs sits in his chair shaking his head amidst the chaos
left in Dan’s wake

INT VICTORIAS HOUSE - DAY

Dan and Victoria sit together on her couch clearly having
just come from Nibbs’ office

Her house is nice The Winthrop family fortune has been very
very good to her and her home shows it

Dan looks at a picture of her and her father on the table

DAN MINTNER
I uh I want to thank you for
sticking up for me back there
with Nibbs

VICTORIA
Well I appreciate you-

DAN MINTNER
Don’t ever do it again

VICTORIA
What

DAN MINTNER
I can take care of myself

VICTORIA
Oh okay

DAN MINTNER
Now that that’s out of the way I
know my original assessment of
the crime scene had us way off
base but I’m still not entirely
convinced someone with military
training didn’t do this

VICTORIA
But we followed that lead It
ended at an Asian slave trade
crime syndicate

DAN MINTNER
I know

Dan puts the picture back on a table and notices another one
of Charles Winthrop Dax Cutter and himself back in Desert
Storm all shirtless

DAN MINTNER
Why do you have this photo

VICTORIA
It was always one of my favorite
pictures of my dad He looked so

happy

DAN MINTNER
We were all happier then I think
All except Cutter

VICTORIA
So where do you think you’1ll
start looking now

DAN MINTNER
Ill probably go talk to another
old special ops buddy See if
he’s heard anything Like I said
I’m still convinced whoever did
this has had some serious
military training People with
training like that are known to
other people with training like
that

VICTORIA
I see

DAN MINTNER
No I see

INT GYM - DAY

A YOKED OUT BODYBUILDER GUY is bench pressing probably like
900 pounds

Every muscle straining every vein bulging every pore
sweating every tooth gritting he’s on his third rep barely
able to get it up almost at the top when

A hand comes down on top of the bar forcing it back down on
his chest

He struggles for a few beats as his chest is being crushed
under the weight

Then the hand that forced the bar down is joined by it’s
match and the weight is lifted off the Yoked Out Body Builder
Guy and racked back on the bench press weight stand

The Yoked Out Body Builder Guy is furious He gets up off the
bench and turns to face the asshole that almost killed him

YOKED OUT BODYBUILDER GUY
What in the hell do you think
you’ re-

His anger is replaced by surprise when he sees Dan Minter
standing there chewing on a toothpick

YOKED OUT BODYBUILDER GUY
Dan Mintner What in the hell are
you doing here

The Yoked Out Bodybuilder Guy extends his forearm and the two
do a forearm handshake identical to the one we saw Dan do
with Hulk

DAN MINTNER
Just looking for a friendly game
of racquetball with a fellow
former special ops commando

The Yoked Out Bodybuilder smiles It’s fucking on

INT RACQUETBALL COURT - MINUTES LATER

Dan and The Yoked Out Bodybuilder enter the court rackets in
hand The Yoked Out Bodybuilder wears protective goggles Dan
sticks to his shades and toothpickmatchstick

YOKED OUT BODYBUILDER GUY
Lag for serve

DAN MINTNER
Nah all you Jesse

Jesse takes his place in the serving lane He’s about to drop
the ball and get this game underway when

DAN MINTNER
Wait

Jesse looks back at Dan

DAN MINTNER
What in the name of Christ’s cock
were we thinking

They shoot each other a look that signifies they’ve forgotten
something seminal then they both remove their shirts and
flex

What follows will bring proof to any who gaze upon its glory
that God not only exists but watches this scene again and
again on his Tivo

A shirtless super slow motion racquetball game complete with
crystal clear droplets of sweat dancing across every inch of
each of the participants’ bodies brutal corner shots
ricochets off heads asses and balls backhands so hard the
ball explodes etc

The entire sequence is so gay it becomes badass by traversing
the gay spectrum to land back on the opposite end at supreme
badass

The sequence returns to normal motion as Dan takes the ball
to the service lane and bounces it a few times readying
himself

DAN MINTNER
You talk to Captain Winthrop or
anybody from our old crew since
we all came back

JESSE
Can’t say that I have Why

DAN MINTNER
Just trying to put some pieces
together see if I can’t figure
out where the Captain is

JESSE
You FBI now

DAN MINTNER
Do you have a vagina now

JESSE
No
DAN MINTNER
Can’‘t tell from the way you play
racquetball

JESSE
If you’re not FBI then why are
you trying to hunt down the
Captain

DAN MINTNER
He was like a father to me

JESSE
He was like a father to all of
us

DAN MINTNER
But he was more like a father to
me

JESSE
I suppose

DAN MINTNER
And the more I’ve been thinking
about it lately Cutter didn’t
like old Cap too much

JESSE
Look man they might have had
some beef back in the shit but
that was a long time ago I’m
sure it’s water under the bridge
You know

DAN MINTNER
No Do you know

JESSE
Yeah I guess I mean we were all
special ops That means loyalty
till death no matter what the
circumstance You don’t think
Cutter had something to do with
the kidnapping do you

DAN MINTNER
Nah I do think it was someone
who had training similar to our
own though

(MORE )

DAN MINTNER (contd)
Which is why I thought I’d ask
you if you’ve heard of anyone new
in the ex-commando community

JESSE
Can’t say that I have You gonna
serve

DAN MINTNER
Point 8

Dan drops the ball smashes it probably like around 500 miles
an hour and gets a perfect ace serve off the wall -
unreturnable

DAN MINTNER
Game

Dan walks over to his shirt puts is back on

DAN MINTNER
Take care of yourself Jesse

JESSE
You too Dan

Dan exits the racquetball court

As soon as he gets out of earshot Jesse flips open a cell
phone and makes a call

JESSE
(into cell phone)
He’s getting closer

INT DANS SWEET RIDE - NIGHT

Dan drives down the road his face locked in a mask of cold
rage (as per normal)

His cell phone rings

DAN MINTNER
What

LARRY SPERMAN
Hello Mr Mintner

DAN MINTNER
Who in the fuck is this

LARRY SPERMAN
It’s Larry Sperman I don’t know
how much time I have

DAN MINTNER
What are you talking about Slow
down

LARRY SPERMAN

I’m not talking fast Look I
think I might have gotten in over
my head with this

DAN MINTNER
What are you talking about Slow
down

LARRY SPERMAN
Again I’m not talking fast I
know where Winthrop is

DAN MINTNER
Have you told the feds

LARRY SPERMAN
No

DAN MINTNER
Why not

LARRY SPERMAN

I don’t know who I can trust and
for some reason it seemed like
youd be the best person to call
I did this for the money at
first but now it’s gotten out of
control I just want out I can
take you to Winthrop if you
promise to protect me

DAN MINTNER
I don’t make promises to
douchebags

LARRY SPERMAN
The FBI won’t be able to keep me
safe not from the people who are
involved I need your help

DAN MINTNER
Fine Ill be at your house in 10
minutes And if this is some kind
of trap I’m going to give you a
new butthole

LARRY SPERMAN
What

DAN MINTNER
I said I’m going to give you a
new butthole

LARRY SPERMAN
A new butthole Okay um just
hurry

Dan’s sweet ass Iroc-Z speeds down the highway
EXT SPERMANS HOUSE - MINUTES LATER

As Dan pulls up he sees cop cars yellow police tape feds
and cops everywhere It’s a motherfucking crime scene

INT SPERMAN’S HOUSE - SAME

Dan kicks the door open as per the patented Dan Mintner
Badass for Hire entrance we’ve now become accustomed to

He pauses for a few beats taking in the entire room

Cops and FBI agents alike mill around dusting for prints
Sperman’s corpse is outlined on the ground near a chair a
gun in his hand and a clear bullet wound right between the
eyes

Nibbs is talking to Victoria Dan finds Victoria’s presence a
little strange He walks up to her

DAN MINTNER
What in the hell are you doing
here

CARTER NIBBS
Jesus Christ on the motherfucking
cross

He throws up his hands - giving up on keeping Dan away from
the case

VICTORIA
Larry called me asked me to come
over

DAN MINTNER
How long ago

VICTORIA
Around ten minutes ago

DAN MINTNER
Hmmm

He eyes her

CARTER NIBBS
Look Mintner I’ve already
covered everything here It’s a
suicide case closed

DAN MINTNER
Suicide Did somebody replace
your eyes with turds ‘Cause your
view of this crime scene is shit

CARTER NIBBS
He was scared didn’t know what
to do and ballistics confirms the
round in his head came from the
gun that’s still in his hand
It’s a suicide

DAN MINTNER
Well I was on the phone with him
about ten minutes ago too
That’s why I’m here He was
scared sure but not suicidal
You do as many tours in the shit
as I have you can tell suicidal
in a man’s voice and Sperman
wasn’t suicidal

CARTER NIBBS
With all due respect Mintner
you’re out ‘yo god-damned mind

VICTORIA
Dan I appreciate all youre
trying to do to help find my
father but maybe this time Agent
Nibbs is right

DAN MINTNER
Wait

Dan moves over to the body Inspects it

DAN MINTNER
Doesn’t it strike you a bit
strange that he shot himself
right between the eyes

Dan whips out one of his own guns and points it right between
his own two eyes to prove how awkward it looks

DAN MINTNER
Who does that

CARTER NIBBS
A man who wants to make sure he
gets the job done

DAN MINTNER
Nah something’s not right here

Dan takes off his jacket revealing a skin-tight sleeveless
black t-shirt Then he pulls out some black rubber gloves
from his back pocket works his fingers into them and starts
poking around Sperman’s head

After a few seconds he looks closer at the gun

DAN MINTNER
Here Look at the gun

Nibbs Victoria and a few agents look in the general
direction

DAN MINTNER
The safety’s on

VICTORIA
So

DAN MINTNER
So I’ve known some tough bastards
in my life but no one so tough
they can switch a safety back on
after they kill themselves

Nibbs can’t deny this is strange

CARTER NIBBS
How’d we miss that

DAN MINTNER
You missed it Nibbs for two
reasons 1 - because you saw what
Sperman’s murderer or murderers
wanted you to see - a simple
suicide And 2 - you’re a pussy
and pussies don’t have eyes

CARTER NIBBS
But why would someone have
switched it back on

DAN MINTNER
Same reason you’re about to duck

CARTER NIBBS
What

Dan picks up an iron that was laying on a nearby ironing
board and throws it at Nibbs as hard as he can

Nibbs does indeed duck as the iron smashes a window

CARTER NIBBS
What in the hell-

DAN MINTNER
Reflex Nibbs reflex The person
who did this switched the safety
back on because it’s a reflex
action taught to every special
ops trained soldier in every
branch of the US Military The
second you know a weapon is
unlikely to be discharged for at
least the next minute the safety
must be engaged

(MORE )

DAN MINTNER (contd)
It’s standard operating procedure
and once it’s drilled into you
for years it’s a reflex It
can’t be helped

CARTER NIBBS
Holy shit

DAN MINTNER
This was a murder Nibbs and it
was done by the same people who
took Charles Winthrop

Dan takes off his black rubber gloves and shoots them like
rubber bands at Nibbs

Nibbs can do nothing He knows Dan is 100 percent correct
Dan removes his shirt and flexes

CARTER NIBBS
What are you doing

DAN MINTNER
Expressing my dominance

Dan flexes his naked pectorals in silent victory for many
more beats than is necessary or comfortable for anyone in the
room

INT VICTORIAS HOUSE - NIGHT
Dan and Victoria walk in to her living room

VICTORIA
What you did back there was
really amazing Dan I can’t
thank you enough

DAN MINTNER
Thanking me for examining a crime
scene better than a team of
trained FBI agents is like
thanking a guy who had a
colostomy for shitting ina
plastic bag It’s just what he
does

VICTORIA
Well thanks nonetheless Make
yourself at home I’m going to
get us something to drink

She disappears into the kitchen somewhere as Dan takes a seat
on the couch

VICTORIA (0S)
So whats your next step going to
be

DAN MINTNER
Same thing it’s always been -
find the douchebag or bags who
kidnapped your father

VICTORIA (0S)
I know but I meant where are you
going to start looking

DAN MINTNER
That I’m not sure about yet

Victoria comes back in with two drinks in hand

VICTORIA
I hope scotch is okay

She hands him a scotch on the rocks

Dan takes the toothpick out of his mouth pounds the booze
and puts the toothpick back in his mouth before Victoria can
even raise her own glass to her lips

DAN MINTNER
Thanks

VICTORIA
Do you really think we still have
a chance at finding my dad

DAN MINTNER
As long as I’m alive we do

VICTORIA
I don’t know Sometimes it
feels so hopeless like we should
just give up You know

Dan takes slowly takes off his sunglasses and looks at
Victoria like she just shit in his face

He slaps her hard She recoils at first but then looks back
at him knowing she’s in the wrong

DAN MINTNER

Don’t you ever say anything like

that again
She’s equal parts furious at and attracted to Dan
Dan spits his toothpick into the fireplace Then he reaches
around behind her head pulls her mouth to his and kisses her
for the second time in the movie like she’s never been kissed
before
This time though it doesn’t end with a kiss
INT VICTORIA’S BEDROOM - MINUTES LATER

Dan and Victoria stand near her bed kissing passionately

Dan reaches up grabs Victoria’s shirt and rips it off in one
stroke

He does the same with her pants so she’s standing in front of
him in only her bra and panties still kissing him like her
life depends on it

Dan pushes her away a few inches putting a momentary end to
the kissing

VICTORIA
Why are you stopping

Dan takes his two guns Thelma and Louise out of his pants
and sets them down on Victoria’s dresser

DAN MINTNER
Now it’s time for you to get on
the bed

VICTORIA
Oh I like the sound of that

Dan picks her up over his head pro-wrestling style and body
slams her onto the bed

Shes visibly turned on by this

He stands over her for a few beats as she thrashes around on
the bed in ecstacy

VICTORIA
Why don’t you take off your
clothes and join me

DAN MINTNER
I only take off my clothes for
racquetball fighting and
displaying dominance over other
men

VICTORIA
But how are we going to

Dan puts up his index finger stopping Victoria’s line of
questioning

Then he points down toward his crotch with the same index
finger as he moves it toward the zipper area of his pants

With his thumb and forefinger he grabs a zipper in the crotch
of his pants and gives it a gentle pull

Very slowly Dan unzips a small round patch of leather in the
crotch of his pants and drops it to the ground (like assless
chaps almost but crotchless instead)

DAN MINTNER
Had these pants specially made
for nights just like this one

Dans fully clad ass takes up half the screen

Victoria’s reaction takes up the other half as she gazes upon
Dan’s completely exposed genitals (which we can’t see)

Her jaw drops and her eyes get huge
VICTORIA
Oh my god You weren’t kidding

about those fire ants

DAN MINTNER
No I wasn’t

Dan leaps onto the bed and takes Victoria into his arms Her
world is about to be rocked and she knows it

He lays down on top of her kisses her then pulls back for a
second

DAN MINTNER
Wait This is your last chance

VICTORIA
For what

DAN MINTNER
To turn back

VICTORIA
Why

DAN MINTNER
When I make love to a woman
she’s never the same If we do
this you’1ll be ruined for all
other men and no matter how much
you’re going to think you can’t
live without me I’‘1ll never love
you

She pulls him back down on top of her and Dan shows her what
it’s really like to be a woman by showing her what it’s like
to be with a real man

INT VICTORIAS BEDROOM - MORNING

Dan wakes up in Victoria’s bed fully clothed (except for the
crotch piece he zipped off the night before of course)

He looks over and sees her sleeping next to him her hair
messed up limbs akimbo sheets strategically covering her
junk and boobs She looks like she got hit by a train

Dan smirks to himself seeing a woman the morning after he’s
worked his magic never gets old

He tosses off the covers to get out of bed taking no care to
leave Victoria undisturbed

He gets out of bed searches the room for a few beats to find
his leather crotch piece finds it zips it back on and makes
his way out of the bedroom

INT VICTORIA’S KITCHEN - SAME

Dan walks in goes through the cupboards looking for
something

Finally he finds some coffee but it’s in the little instant
coffee pod things

He shakes his head disappointed and disgusted But having no
choice he takes a few pods and makes his way out of the
kitchen

INT VICTORIA’S LIVING ROOM - SAME
Dan sits down on the couch

He tears one of the coffee pods open with his teeth spitting
the paper on the ground Then he pours the coffee grounds
into his mouth like trail mix and crunches on it as he flips
on the TV

It’s the news
ON TV

A SPECIAL REPORTER in the field holds a piece of toilet
paper He’s wrapping up his special report

SPECIAL REPORTER

So even though it might seem
strange or unsanitary at first
the studies show that wiping only
once a week can add years to your
life and that’s about as happy
an ending as you can ask for For

BACK TO THE STUDIO
NEWS ANCHOR
(laughing)
Ha ha thanks for that very
special report Jeff

The news anchor switches tone in the bat of an eye

NEWS ANCHOR

(completely serious)
And now a breaking development in
the kidnapping of billionaire
business mogul Charles Winthrop
This morning a video tape was
leaked to all major media outlets
from an unknown source A warning
to all our viewers the video is
shocking and real

The video plays
ON THE VIDEO

Charles Winthrop sits in a chair tied to it a few days of
stubble on his face a cut lip but overall not looking too
bad considering he’s been kidnapped

WINTHROP
(clearly reading)

Hello my name is Charles
Winthrop This video is to serve
as proof that I am in good health
and have not been mistreated in
any way My captors are aware of
the FBI’s efforts to locate me
and they would like Agent Nibbs
and the rest of the world to know
that my release will only become
a reality if the sum of 100
billion dollars is transferred to
a Swiss bank account that will be
made known to the FBI shortly If
the sum is not in the designated
account in one week’s time I
will be executed

A beat of silence

WINTHROP
I love you honey-

A hand hits Winthrop hard across the face and the video cuts
out

BACK IN THE STUDIO

The News Anchor works up her best concerned face

NEWS ANCHOR
Experts and business analysts
agree that the sum on 100 billion
dollars seems strange due to the
fact that no one is capable of
delivering those kinds of funds
not even Winthrop himself unless
he were to sell his company
These recent developments have
sent Winthrop Industries stock in
a downward spiral that seems like
it may never end Stay tuned for
more updates on this shocking
turn of events as they’re made
available right here on channel 4
news

Dan tuns off the TV crunches on a few more coffee grounds
and turns around to see Victoria in a bathrobe She’s awake
but still looks like she got hit by a bus

Dan empties the rest of the coffee grounds into his mouth and
does a hard swallow

DAN MINTNER
Nice hair

Dan stands up off the couch

VICTORIA
Oh my god Dan last night was

DAN MINTNER
I know Wish I could say the
same

Dan straightens up his leather jacket pulls on a pair of
fingerless black leather gloves puts on his shades and pops
a toothpick in his mouth

VICTORIA
Where are you going

DAN MINTNER
To get your father back

She looks concerned

VICTORIA
Let me take a shower I’m coming
with you

DAN MINTNER
No no time We have to go now

VICTORIA
But I need to wash myself I
smell like sex

DAN MINTNER

Leave it

VICTORIA
Okay can I at least put on some
clothes

DAN MINTNER
If you don’t hurry you’1ll be
asking your father’s corpse if
it’s okay to put on some clothes

VICTORIA
Itll just be a minute

Dan raises his watch

DAN MINTNER
You have twenty seconds Go

Dan clicks his watch and it beeps

Victoria hurries off into her bedroom

INT DANS APT - DAY

Dan and Victoria walk in It’ clear she’s never been inside
based on her reaction to the sparse furnishings and overall

shittiness of the place

The table Dan smashed earlier still clutters the “kitchen”
area

Dan walks over to his crappy small TV which sits on top of a
VCR not a cable box or a Tivo an old school VCR

DAN MINTNER
Since your father was kidnapped
I set this thing to record the
news every morning just in case
there was something in the
broadcast that I needed to re-
watch

Dan reaches down presses the rewind button

DAN MINTNER
Looks like today was the day it
paid off

The VCR clicks to a stop as the tape fully rewinds Dan
reaches down hits play and then takes a seat on the couch
next to Victoria

He picks up a VCR remote control and fast forwards through
the News Anchor to get to Winthrop’s video tape - the one we
saw in the previous scene

As it replays Dan closes his eyes and cups his ears with his
hands

VICTORIA
What are you doing

DAN MINTNER
What does it look like I’m doing

VICTORIA
I don’t know That’s why I asked
you

DAN MINTNER
I’m listening

VICTORIA
For what

DAN MINTNER
For clues any background noises
ambient tones offscreen sounds
etc That might give away your
father’s location

Dan concentrates We hear what he hears

Almost as though the sounds are underwater and slowed down
he’s able to isolate certain things in the tape

A TRAIN WHISTLE

DAN MINTNER
There’s a train whistle He’s
near a train station

A LOW ELECTRICAL HUM

DAN MINTNER
There’s some kind of a low
electrical hum wait

He listens closer straining

DAN MINTNER
It’s an electric current only
produced in the engines of
forklifts used in warehouse
capacities So he’s got to be in
or near some type of warehouse

A REPETITIVE CLICKING NOISE once every five seconds or so

DAN MINTNER
What is that

VICTORIA
What

DAN MINTNER
That clicking Do you hear it

Victoria tries for a second

VICTORIA
I don’t think so Are you sure
you’re hearing this right I mean
shouldn’t you be doing this with
some kind of high tech machine or
computer or something Or
wouldn’t it be easier if you were
even at least wearing a pair of
headphones

Dan opens his eyes pauses the tape and looks at Victoria
like he’s about to break her jaw

DAN MINTNER
Headphones

Dan points to his ears

DAN MINTNER
Do you know what I can do with
these

She waits for him to answer his own question thinking it’s
rhetorical

DAN MINTNER
Again do you know what I can do
with these

VICTORIA

DAN MINTNER
Let me tell you a little story
It starts back in the shit

CUT TO
EXT CRAPPY SHACK OF A HOUSE DESERT STORM - NIGHT

Dan’s Special Ops squad all decked out in night vision
goggles waits outside the front door of the house their
backs against the wall ready to break down the door at a
moment’s notice

Dax Cutter is leading the squad Jesse is present among the
commandos

EXT HILL OVERLOOKING THE CRAPPY SHACK OF A HOUSE DESERT
STORM - NIGHT

Dan and Captain Winthrop lay on their stomachs Winthrop
looks through some night vision goggle type binoculars while
Dan strikes a pose identical to the one we just saw him in
hands cupped around hears eyes closed listening

WINTHROP
Remember Dan we need to know
when he’s at his most vulnerable
and when he’s alone

DAN MINTNER
Yes sir

INT CRAPPY SHACK OF A HOUSE DESERT STORM - SAME

Inside a FAT MIDDLE EASTERN TYPE DUDE eats a sandwich
dripping with juices (think Carl’s Junior commercial) with
three ARMED GUARDS in the room

We hear what Dan hears

A bite of the sandwich being eaten and subsequent slurping of
the juices - sounds like a Tyrannosaurus Rex chomping down on
something and slurping it dry

EXT HILL OVERLOOKING THE CRAPPY SHACK OF A HOUSE DESERT
STORM

WINTHROP
Whaddya got Mintner

DAN MINTNER
He’s eating sir 3 armed men in
the room with him

EXT CRAPPY SHACK OF A HOUSE DESERT STORM

Cutter is getting antsy He raises a hand to his mouth (where
his secret ops microphone is located)

DAX CUTTER
Sir we can take whoever’s in
that room Do we have the green
light to move in

EXT HILL OVERLOOKING THE CRAPPY SHACK OF A HOUSE DESERT
STORM

WINTHROP
Negative We wait for the
confirmation from Mintner that
the target is alone and
vulnerable
EXT CRAPPY SHACK OF A HOUSE DESERT STORM

Dax is flustered

DAX CUTTER
Fucking Mintner

Dax furiously chews a piece of gum And pops it

INT CRAPPY SHACK OF A HOUSE DESERT STORM
The Fat Middle Eastern Type Dude FARTS and then laughs
The armed guards react in disgust

The Fat Middle Eastern Type Dude says something in his native
tongue and the guards are dismissed

As they leave he gets up and walks into another room taking
his dripping sandwich with him

EXT CRAPPY SHACK OF A HOUSE DESERT STORM
Dax talks back into his sleeve microphone

DAX CUTTER
There’s movement inside We
should take him now

EXT HILL OVERLOOKING THE CRAPPY SHACK OF A HOUSE DESERT
STORM

Winthrop responds into his own sleeve microphone

WINTHROP
Negative Wait for my command

Dan is still listening

WINTHROP
What’s going on in there Mintner

DAN MINTNER
The guards are gone and he’s
still eating but he’s moving I
think he’s going to drop a
deuce

WINTHROP
While he eats

DAN MINTNER
Yes

WINTHROP
Sweet Jesus in the manger Let me
know when you have confirmation
on that deuce

We hear what Dan hears again A TORRENT OF SHIT FALLING OUT
OF A GUY’S BUTTHOLE and VERY SLOPPY EATING at the same time

DAN MINTNER
Confirmed He’s deucing and
eating No guards Take him

WINTHROP
(into his sleeve
microphone )
You have the green light But be
warned this could very well be
the most horrific sight of the
entire war for each of you

EXT CRAPPY SHACK OF A HOUSE DESERT STORM

Dax Cutter gives the squad some military style hand signals
and they move in silent as ghosts

They get to a closed door Dax throws a few more hand signals
and Jesse kicks the door in to reveal

The Fat Middle Eastern Type Dude completely naked sits ona
crapper letting bombs fly out of his ass while he chokes down
a grotesque sandwich juice all over his chest and belly

Cutter and the entire squad vomit upon seeing him doing his
business

EXT DESERT STORM SPECIAL OPS CAMP - LATER

The Fat Middle Eastern Type Dude still naked is bound and
gagged He’s hussled off somewhere by a few commandos

Dan Winthrop and Dax Cutter (a little dried puke on his
shirt) discuss the operation

WINTHROP
Dan that was more than
impressive This operation was a
success because of you Here’s a
medal

Winthrop tosses Dan a medal

WINTHROP
Cutter you did an okay job but
you need to learn to follow
orders and put your own thoughts
and feelings about a mission in
check No medal

Dax cutter chews his gum with the ferocity of ten thousand
angry sharks Then he pops it The sound of Dax popping his
gum echoes through time

INT DAN’S APARTMENT PRESENT DAY - DAY

Dax’s gum pop rings in Dan’s ears like a nuclear explosion as
he stares into space slowly realizing what the noise was he
heard on the tape

VICTORIA
Okay I get it You have really
good hearing

DAN MINTNER
That clicking noise I know it I
remember it

VICTORIA
Really what is it

DAN MINTNER
Dax Cutter

EXT RAILYARD —- DAY
Dan’s tricked out Iroc-Z tears into a parking lot on the side
of a giant railyard This railyard has trains warehouses and
all of the other type of crap that any other railyard would
have
Dan’s car does a power slide into a parking place
INT DAN’S TRICKED OUT IROC-Z - SAME
Dan looks over at Victoria who sits in the passenger’s seat
DAN MINTNER
You shouldn’t be here I don’t

know what I was thinking letting
you come

VICTORIA
I was going to come whether you
wanted me to or not

DAN MINTNER
Youre a real feisty broad and I
like that in the sack but this
ain’t the time for it Stay in
the car

VICTORIA
How do you even know this is the
right place

DAN MINTNER
The specific combination of
subtle sounds on that tape can
only be produced in a railyard
and this is the only railyard
within 200 miles If nothing
else I’d say it’s a good place
to start

VICTORIA
Well if this is the right place
I’m coming with you If you find
my father I want to be there

DAN MINTNER
Before I find your father I’m
going to have to find the people
who took him and I don’t think
they’re going to be too happy
when they see me I can’t be
worrying about you when the
bullets start flying

Victoria pulls out a little 22 pistol from a holster ona
garter belt

VICTORIA
I can handle myself

DAN MINTNER
That’s cute She got a name

VICTORIA
My gun
DAN MINTNER
Yeah what’s her name

VICTORIA
I didn’t know guns had names

DAN MINTNER
Well a gun can’t be fired until
it has a name and I’m not getting
out of this car with someone who
can’t fire their gun So name it

VICTORIA
Do your guns have names

Dan whips out his hand cannons one at a time

DAN MINTNER
This is Thelma and this is
Louise I named ‘em after two of
the toughest broads I could think
of

VICTORIA
Okay Thelma Louise meet Punky

DAN MINTNER
Who the fuck is Punky

VICTORIA
Punky Brewster

DAN MINTNER
Whatever

Dan winces at the absurdity of Victoria’s gun’s name
DAN MINTNER
Guess I didn’t say it had to be a
good name Let’s roll
Dan and Victoria exit the car guns drawn
EXT RAILYARD - DAY
As they enter the main area of the railyard Dan stalks

around the place like a jungle cat taking in everything
around him

He sniffs the air presses his ear to the ground licks the
dirt takes off his shirt urinates on his hands and rubs the
urine all over his face chest etc

VICTORIA
What in the hell are you doing

DAN MINTNER
Neutralizing my scent so I can
pick up your father’s

VICTORIA
That’s disgusting

DAN MINTNER
Some of my tracking skills may
seem unorthodox to you but
that’s only because they’re so
advanced you can’t possibly begin
to understand how they work

VICTORIA
How does urinating on your hands
qualify as a tracking skill

Dan stops everything he’s doing to lower his shades and stare
at Victoria

In one lightning quick move Dan is inches away from
Victoria’s face

He grabs her face with one of his freshly urinated on hands

DAN MINTNER
Why don’t you ask that question
to the 15 POWs I was able to
track and rescue by using exactly
that technique

Victoria winces wiping her face off
Dan goes back to his strange tracking practices
DAN MINTNER (CONT’D)
My tracking skills are actually
operating on such a high level
that some people have accused me

of having psychic powers

Victoria looks at him for a beat

Then her cell phone RINGS

DAN MINTNER
Cut that noise I’m very close to
locating something I need to
hear only the sounds of the
railyard

Victoria answers her phone
VICTORIA
(into phone)

Hello

DAN MINTNER
Take that crap somewhere else

She walks off leaving Dan to his tracking business

While she’s gone Dan takes off his shirt and humps the
ground for a solid 20 seconds or so

Victoria returns to find Dan mid thrust

DAN MINTNER
Who was it

Victoria balks for a split second but it doesn’t go unnoticed
by Dan

VICTORIA
Uh it was Agent Nibbs

DAN MINTNER
What’d he want

VICTORIA
Um just the usual stuff

DAN MINTNER
Oh

VICTORIA
Yeah

Out of no where Dan hops up and aims both Thelma and Louise
at Victoria
DAN MINTNER
What’s the square root of 81 You
have 2 seconds

Dan clicks his watch It beeps

VICTORIA

Dan’s watch beeps again 2 seconds are up

DAN MINTNER
Time’s up

VICTORIA
I said 9

DAN MINTNER
I know I was just saying that
time was up

Dan puts his guns back in his pants (one front one

DAN MINTNER
Just had to make sure you were
telling me the truth

VICTORIA
Have you found anything

DAN MINTNER
A better question would be what
haven’t I found and the answer
would be only the things I’ve
never looked for

VICTORIA
So you know where my father is

DAN MINTNER
He’s in one of the warehouses in
this railyard and I’m 100 percent
certain Dax Cutter is his captor

VICTORIA
Are you going to tell Nibbs

back)

DAN MINTNER
The answer to that is the same
answer to this question Am I
going to pour gasoline on our
genitals and light them on fire
Answer No Nibbs and his Feds
have screwed up every step of the
way We leave him out of this at
all costs if you want to see your
father alive

Dan catches something out of the corner of his eye He looks
over and about a hundred yards away walking near a giant
cargo container is none other than Dax motherfucking Cutter

DAN MINTNER
Cutter

VICTORIA
What

Before she gets any explanation Dan is gone sprinting after
Cutter like he’s in the Olympics

Cutter sees Dan coming and takes off in the opposite
direction in what will be known in film history as “The
Greatest Chase Scene of All Fucking Time Bar None Past
Present or Future”

Begin Chase Sequence Various Locations

-Cutter sprints out of the warehouse area of the railyard
toward the parking lot Dan is hot on his trail

-Cutter finds a bicycle chained to a bike rack he jerks the
bike hard enough to free it from the chain and takes off
pedaling as hard as he can

-Dan comes to the same bike rack seconds after Cutter left
finds another bike snaps the chain with his bare hands gets
on the bike and pedals after Cutter

-Cutter takes a turn off the main street into a BMX style
bike track complete with obstacles and jumps and what not

-Dan follows him in still just seconds behind him
-Cutter leads Dan through a series of insane jumps moguls

obstacles etc Their display leaves the local patrons of the
bike park shocked mouths agape

The bike chase ends with Cutter doing a backflip over the
fence of the enclosed bike park and Dan doing a double
backflip over the same fence following Cutter out

-Outside the bike park Cutter ditches his bicycle for a red

Ducati motorcycle in the parking lot that he has to hotwire

to get started He takes off just as Dan gets to the parking
lot on his bicycle

-Dan ditches his bike for another Ducati motorcycle (this one
blue) that was parked right next to the one Cutter got on
Instead of hotwiring his though Dan does some kind of Fonzy-
esque maneuver that ends with a powerful crotch nudge and the
thing starts up

-Cutter weaves through a few cars into the busy streets
surrounding the BMX park

-Dan follows

-The two chase each other at the top speeds they can muster
on their motorcycles narrowly avoiding cars trucks school
children eating ice cream old ladies with shopping carts
baskets of kittens etc

-As the chase continues Dan whips out Thelma and Louise and
takes a few shots Most go stray breaking windows and blowing
up cars on the street around them One shot however hits
Cutter’s back tire

-With a blown out back tire Cutter is forced to pull into a
parking garage

Dan follows and pulls up just in time to see Cutter hop into
a red Ferrari fire it up and take off Luckily there’s a
matching blue Ferrari in the parking spot next to it

Dan hops in fires up his Ferrari and gives chase

-Dan follows Cutter through the city streets around the
parking structure for a few beats until Cutter takes it to
the highway The highway car chase has Dan firing more shots
at Cutter Cutter firing back at Dan cars blowing up
everywhere Cutter and Dan jumping the middle of the highway
and driving against traffic driving sideways in reverse on
two wheels on one wheel and forcing their cars to do things
that the laws of physics dictate cannot be done Ultimately
Dan lands a shot in the gas tank of Cutter’s car catching it
on fire

-Cutter is forced to pull into a nearby helipad

-Dan follows

-Dan pulls in just in time to see Cutter get in a red
helicopter and take off

-Luckily there’s a matching blue helicopter on the helipad
also Dan hops in fires it up and once again gives chase

-Dan matches cutter move for move in his helicopter flying
under bridges through canyons around huge towers
underwater yeah under fucking water doing dive-rolls loop-
to-loops barrel rolls and all manner of maneuvers that
helicopters should not be able to do And of course Dan is
flying his chopper with one hand while he leans out of the
cockpit to shoot at cutter

-Cutter returns fire and eventually hits Dan’s tail rotor

-Dan is forced to crash land in some trees as Cutter flies
away

EXT TREES - SAME

Dan falls through the trees ala Rambo in First Blood
sustaining some minor physical injuries and a major
psychological one - Cutter got away

As he hits the ground Victoria is there waiting despite the
fact that he probably travelled hundreds of miles during the
course of the chase

VICTORIA
Are you okay Youre bleeding

DAN MINTNER
And Ill keep bleeding until I
track down Cutter

VICTORIA
but don’t you think you should
get to a hospital or something

DAN MINTNER
Hospitals are for tiny babies and
ladies with vaginas

Dan leans over and spits out some blood

INT NIBBS OFFICE - DAY

Dan and Victoria sit in their familiar positions across from
a furious agent Nibbs Dan is still scratched and bruised
from his chase

CARTER NIBBS
You wrecked a fucking helicopter
Mintner Give me one good reason
why I shouldn’t have you locked
up for good you lunatic

DAN MINTNER
If you lock me up I’1ll finda
way out

CARTER NIBBS
And Victoria I understood your
involvement with this guy up to a
point - you would do anything to
get your father back I get that
But you can’t seriously think
Mintner can find him

DAN MINTNER
I did find him asshole

CARTER NIBBS
That’s funny so did we

DAN MINTNER
In the railyard Which warehouse
is he in

CARTER NIBBS
Railyard

DAN MINTNER

Yeah I did some audio analysis
of the ransom tape and was able
to piece together a certain
grouping of sounds that can only
have come from a railyard So I
went to check it out and that’s
when I got in a chase with an old
special ops team member of mine
named Dax Cutter

CARTER NIBBS
Dax Cutter Look Mintner I
don’t know how you ran an audio
analysis on that tape Did you
use a pair of headphones or
something (Laughs) But I can
assure you that our audio
analysis technology is a little
more state of the art than yours
and we were able o find out that
the kidnappers are keeping
Winthrop in the basement of a
Chinese laundromat

DAN MINTNER

CARTER NIBBS
Yeah So I don’t care what you
thought you heard or if you saw
some old war buddy We found
Charles Winthrop We’re going in
to get him tonight with a
tactical strike squad So I
suggest you go home put some
motherufuckin’ Neosporin on your
cuts and watch it on the 10
oclock news

DAN MINTNER
But you’re wrong

CARTER NIBBS
Now get out

Dan and Victoria leave Nibbs’ office
EXT FBI HEADQUARTERS - MINUTES LATER
Dan and Victoria stand on the street

VICTORIA
Well I guess that’s it

DAN MINTNER
What in the fuck did you just
say

VICTORIA
You gave it your best shot but
you heard Nibbs they found my
father

Dan gets right in her face

DAN MINTNER
I don’t know why it’s so hard for
broads to have looks and common
sense at the same time I saw
Cutter Your father is in that
railyard Nibbs is off his
fucking rocker

VICTORIA

What if he’s not What if he’s
right Maybe you should wait and
see what Nibbs turns up before
you go charging into a warehouse
that could very well be empty

DAN MINTNER

A He’s not right B He’s wrong
C Maybe you should wait until
your dad has a bullet in his
skull and his genitals cut off
and stuffed down his throat
courtesy of Dax Cutter until you
see him again

VICTORIA
Why would he cut off his
genitals

DAN MINTNER
Why wouldn’t he

She stares at him too confused to even respond

DAN MINTNER
I’m going in tonight

INT DANS APARTMENT SHOWER - NIGHT

Dan completely naked takes a long hot shower in super slow
motion

He lets the water hit the back of his head and roll down his
face clearly focusing on the mission yet to come

After a few more beats than are necessary with Dan in the
shower he grits his teeth and punches the wall as hard as he
can

INT DAN’S APARTMENT BEDROOM - MINUTES LATER

Dan wearing only a jockstrap stands with his back to us as
he opens his closet

Inside the closet he gazes upon several identical pairs of
tight jeans denim jackets and black t-shirts

Similar to a Rambo getting ready montage we see
-A leg going into a pair of jeans

-A black t-shirt being pulled down over a gut
-An arm going into a denim jacket

-The collar being popped on the denim jacket
-Shades being put on

-A gun going down the front of the pants

-A gun going down the back of the pants

-A matchstick being popped into a mouth

-A gun being taken out of the front of the pants
-A gun being taken out of the back of the pants
-A toilet lid being lifted

-Pants being pulled down

-An ass sitting on the seat

-Teeth gritting with a GRUNT sound

-Toilet paper being torn off the roll

-A toilet being flushed

-Pants being pulled back up

-A gun being put back down the front of the pants

-A gun being put back down the back of the pants

-Finally Dan stands in front of a mirror a one man army
ready to take some serious asskicking to the badguys It’s
fucking on

DAN MINTNER
(to his reflection)
I wouldn’t fuck with you

He stares at himself for a beat

DAN MINTNER
You’re a smart guy

INTEXT WAREHOUSECHINESE LAUNDRY - NIGHT

In a glorious cross cutting extravaganza ala Silence of the
Lambs we follow Agent Nibbs and his squad of FBI field
agents as well as Dan and his squad of himself

-Nibbs along with a few dozen FBI field agents all with guns
at the ready surround an unsuspecting Chinese
LaundyDrycleaning place

NIBBS
(over walkie talkie)
Nobody move till I give the
signal

-In the railyard Dan stalks up to a warehouse door sniffs
it puts two fingers on it then tastes the fingers Shakes
his head in disappointment - this isn’t the one He moves to
another one does the same thing and this time it’s paydirt
He spits out the taste of the door with disgust and pulls out
Thelma and Louise Time to do this damned thang

DAN MINTNER
Okay ladies time to put on your
dancin’ shoes

Dan screws silencers onto each of his guns

-Outside the Chinese LaundryDrycleaning place all of the FBI
agents are in place Nibbs looks in the window sees a few
patrons and an old CHINESE MAN and CHINESE WOMAN behind the
counter

NIBBS
(over walkie talkie)
Go Go Go

The FBI agents storm the place guns drawn The Patrons as
well as the Chinese Man and Chinese woman figuratively shit
their pants One patron literally shits his pants

The Agents scurry around the joint waving guns in people’s
faces and yelling but it seems like they’re coming up empty -
no Winthrop

Nibbs approaches the Chinese Man

CARTER NIBBS
Where’s the basement

CHINESE MAN
We don’t have a basement

Nibbs looks away from the Chinese Man in super slow motion
(Bruckheimer style) the realization of his error sinking in

He stares into the far distance

CARTER NIBBS
Oh my God Mintner

EXT WAREHOUSE IN THE RAILYARD - SIMULTANEOUS

Dan stands in front of the warehouse door framed like a
painting in it’s rectangular shape His guns are drawn his
pants are tight and his teeth are gritted

He doesn’t even bother taking a breath it would waste too
much time Instead he kicks in the door like we’ve seen him
do so many times before and instead of an empty warehouse
like Carter Nibbs would like to believe Dan is met by a
small army of gun-wielding men

INT WAREHOUSE IN THE RAILYARDFOUNDRY - SAME

We also see that this warehouse is no ordinary warehouse
It’s more like a steel foundry similar to the one in the end
of Terminator 2 or Cobra complete with chains swinging
around molten steel everywhere sparks fire all kinds of
nasty shit for people to die in

He ducks rolls jumps and returns fire killing everyone he
shoots at

Random things explode in the warehouse during the fire fight

Some of these things are guys Dan shoots

A few guys get blown back into pools of molten hot steel

A

few guys get crushed in big gear like apparatus a few guys
get so scared of Dan they turn their guns on themselves etc

Your basic badass “one man army storming the enemy citadel

scene

As Dan moves into and out of cover slowly advancing toward

”

to the back of warehouse killing a few guys with every step

he looks and sees Jesse (the ex-commando he played
racquetball with) Hulk (the giant bouncer) and Cutter
standing together firing at him with machine guns

Dan ducks behind some crates in order to reload Sparks fl
next to his head from some unseen foundry device

LY

He takes a moment to whips out a cigar and light it off the

molten sparks

DAN MINTNER
(yelling to his enemies
Nice to see you again shitbags

DAX CUTTER
You too Mintner I wasn’t sure
you’d come back after our little
chase the other day

DAN MINTNER
You know me Cutter - can’t quit
until the job is done

DAX CUTTER
You’re outnumbered Mintner

DAN MINTNER
When has that ever stopped me

DAX CUTTER
There’s a first time for
everything

DAN MINTNER
And there’s a last time for some
things too Cutter

DAX CUTTER
Like me breathing Is that what
you were going to say

DAN MINTNER
No I was going to say like you
getting an erection I’d say your
last boner was somewhere around
‘92 Am I right

Cutter is visibly flustered by his comment

DAX CUTTER
Kill this son of a bitch

Cutter retreats back into some other room of the
warehousefoundry leaving his minions to dispose of Dan
Turns out that’s a mistake

Dan (again in super slow motion) stands up from behind his
crates backlit by flying sparks and fire and shoots all 15
bullets from each of his high capacity clips in both guns
without even looking where he’s shooting

Net result 30 motherfuckers with holes in their heads

The only people left alive in the place are Dan Jesse Hulk
and Cutter where ever he’s scurried away to

Jesse and Hulk look at each other wondering what to do

DAN MINTNER
Jesse Hulk I expected Cutter to
be behind this kind of thing but
not you guys I’m disappointed

Jesse and Hulk lower their weapons and approach Dan He
lowers his but remains wary

JESSE
We’re sorry Dan We just didn’t
have much of a choice

HULK
Dax said he’d kill our families
if we didn’t help him

JESSE
Yeah we couldn’t let him do
that

Dan weighs their excuses

DAN MINTNER
That’s funny Neither one of you
have families

Hulk smiles an evil smile

HULK
You always could see through
bullshit Dan

DAN MINTNER
And now I’m gonna kick through
it too

Dan “holsters” his guns by jamming them back down his super-
tight pants then kicks Hulk right in the chest

Hulk falls to the ground clutching his sternum in pain Jesse
picks up the slack for his fallen comrade He rips a big
chain down off the wall and charges Dan who sidesteps him and
trips him (think Johnny Vs Karate Kid on the beach before
Danielsan becomes a badass)

As Jesse and Hulk writhe in pain on the ground Dan stands
over them

DAN MINTNER
You two have gone soft gotten
weak Where’s Cutter keeping
Captain Winthrop

Jesse gets up off the ground faces Dan swings his chain
around

On the opposite side of Dan Hulk gets up and pulls two
glowing hot metal pips out of a nearby pit of fire and starts
swinging them around like Darth Maul and his double light
sabres

They’ve got Dan boxed in
HULK
We could tell you but then wed
have to kill you

JESSE
Or we could do both

With that Jesse and Hulk launch into a double team attack
the likes of which no movie-going audience has ever witnessed
in their lifetimes

As the white hot metal pipes and chain fly by Dan’s head he
ducks and moves to avoid them

Fists fly kicks careen head-butts heave blood boils etc

With each strike Dan asks questions and Jesse andor Hulk
returns a strike and an answer

Jesse swings his chain near Dan’s face missing by
millimeters

JESSE
Cutter’s keeping old man Winthrop
in this building

Dan avoids the blow and returns one of his own striking
Jesse in the jaw

DAN MINTNER
Where specifically

Hulk swings his white-hot metal pipes at Dan who manages to
avoid the attack again by millimeters

HULK
In a backroom tied up and
gagged

Dan avoids the pipes and counters with a sweep knocking Hulk
on his ass

DAN MINTNER
Is there anyone else back there

Jesse recovers bull charges Dan wrapping the chain around
Dan’s neck choking him

JESSE
No Just us

Dan maintains his composure and smashes Jesse’s nose with a
reverse head-butt

DAN MINTNER
Is Winthrop still alive

Hulk charges Dan

HULK
Of course what good would he be
to us dead

Dan waits for him then uppercuts him right in the fucking
face knocking him out cold

DAN MINTNER
What good is he to you alive
Why‘d you kidnap him in the first
place

Jesse clutching his nose in pain runs at Dan

JESSE
Why don’t you ask-

Jesse is cut off as he takes a bullet to the head and falls
down dead

Dan looks in the direction of the bullet

There standing in a doorway is none other than Dax Cutter
standing over a bound and gagged Charles Winthrop who is tied
to a chair

Dax puts a bullet in the incapacitated Hulk too then turns
his still smoking gun toward Dan

DAN MINTNER
Cutter you fucking asshole

DAX CUTTER
Do you really want those to be
your last words

DAN MINTNER
Do you really want you
questioning my last words to be
your last words

DAX CUTTER
I could now say the same to you
and we’re stuck in an infinite
Loop

DAN MINTNER
Loop these nuts shitbag

Dan whips out his guns and pops off a few rounds before
ducking for cover

Dax Cutter returns fire but hits nothing

Dax leaves Winthrop and starts stalking around the warehouse
looking for Dan

DAX CUTTER
Come out come out wherever you
are
No response
DAX CUTTER

You know Mintner back in Desert
Storm I always hated you because
everyone thought you were tougher
than me After we got out of that
hellhole I realized it didn’t
matter I forgave you But now
in light of recent developments
I have to hate you again I
missed hating you Mintner I
really did It feels good to hate
you again

No response

DAX CUTTER
Mintner this is stupid Can we
just have a shootout and be done
with it

Dan pops up from behind some boxes and fires a single shot
He hits Cutter’s gun and blows it out of his hand

DAN MINTNER
No a shootout’s for fags and
I’m not a fag We’re gonna fight

Dan “holsters” his guns again and walks up to Dax

DAX CUTTER
You sure you want to do this
Mintner No fire ants around this
time

DAN MINTNER
Speaking of last I heard your
junk looked more like a piece of
beef jerky than it did junk

DAX CUTTER
Where’d you hear that

DAN MINTNER
Your mom

That’s it Cutter’s had enough He charges Dan screaming
Dan readies himself

What follows is the clash of the century A mixed martial
arts masterpiece complete with aerial kicks jiu jitsu
submission attempts punches to every internal organ teeth
knocked out pants being pissed basically everything short
of actually using superpowers happens in this fight

And all of this of course is set against the harsh
environment of the foundry - each combatant being forced to
duck and dodge flying chains molten metal streams steam
explosions etc

At the fight’s conclusion Dan and Dax Cutter both battered
and bleeding stand across from one another It seems to have
been a very close fight

DAN MINTNER
I still don’t get it Cutter
why’d you do it

DAX CUTTER
It wasn’t my idea Mintner

DAN MINTNER
What Who’s idea was it

And we see the same thing that happened to Jesse happen to
Cutter a bullet to the dome drops him like a sack of
concrete

Dan turns and looks over to see Victoria Winthrop holding he
smoking gun this time as she stands over her father

EXT RAILYARD WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

As Dan fights for his life inside outside Agent Nibbs and
his FBI crew pull up

Agent Nibbs gets out of his car along with the other Agents

CARTER NIBBS
Okay there might be some bad
shit going down in there so
brace yourselves and don’t make
any moves without my order

The FBI agents surround the building Nibbs cracks a door
just enough to see what’s going on

Victoria standing near her tied up father pointing a gun at
Dan

CARTER NIBBS
(to all gents)
Move in slowly

INT RAILYARD WAREHOUSE - SAME

Victoria slowly walks down to Dan gun trained on him the
entire time

Unnoticed by Victoria or Dan Nibbs and his agents move in
and surround them taking cover behind boxes and what not

VICTORIA
Dan Dan Dan You were so close
And now you have to die

DAN MINTNER
Then do it if you have the guts
I‘1l bet you’ve never killed
anyone in your life

VICTORIA
I just shot Cutter in the head
right in front of you

DAN MINTNER
I know and I’1l hate you for that
forever

VICTORIA
I thought he was your arch-enemy
or something I thought you’d be
happy he’s dead

DAN MINTNER
Bros before hoes

VICTORIA
Whatever I’m actually very
impressed by you Dan You
managed to figure out almost
exactly what was going on and
almost exactly who was behind it

DAN MINTNER
If it was you the whole time
why’d you help me try to find
your father

VICTORIA
I didn’t help you you fool I
stayed close to you to find out
what you knew and to try to keep
you as far away from the truth as
possible I knew that retard
Nibbs would never figure it out-

Nibbs crouching behind a box is appalled at the insult

VICTORIA (CONTD)
-but you you presented a
possible problem I was sure
those Asian slave traders were
going to take care of you when I
had your old partner lead you
down that path but you turned
the tables Very impressive

DAN MINTNER
I still want to know why

VICTORIA
Money It’s always money Dan My
father was getting old didn’t
know how to manage the company
anymore Everyone could see that
Stock prices were falling we
were in trouble

(MORE )

VICTORIA (contd)
But there was no way he would
willingly give up the company to
me and I couldn’t find anyone to
partner with who would initiate a
hostile takeover because of the
poor stock performance So I sped
things up a little I knew a
kidnapping would do two things
It would drive stock down even
further and it would get my
father out of the picture for a
few weeks Once the stock hits
rock bottom I’m going to buy 51
percent and take over the
company

DAN MINTNER
What about your father

VICTORIA
I was going to throw Nibbs a bone
and let him find my father
driving the stock back up but
now that all my scapegoats are
dead I guess Nibbs will just
have to find the dead bodies of
my father and his captors And it
will have to look very much like
everyone died in a botched
attempt at escape by the brave
war hero Charles Winthrop

DAN MINTNER
Youre a cunt

VICTORIA
Wait I get much worse

With her gun still pointing at Dan she walks up to him
kisses him hard and takes one of his guns out of his pants

VICTORIA
You’re going to be the one who
killed my father
She points Dan’s gun at Winthrop

Nibbs and the rest of the FBI pop up from behind boxes with
their guns drawn

NIBBS
FBI - freeze

Dan and Victoria turn to see they’re surrounded

DAN MINTNER
Back off Nibbs this is my fight

Dan waits a beat then rushes her just as she’s shooting She
gets off her shot anyway hitting Winthrop in the chest and
knocking him down He’s clearly still alive though

Dan quickly kicks both guns out of her hands and they square
off

NIBBS
(into walkie talkie)
Anyone have a clear shot

We see a few FBI agent’s POV’s No one can get to Victoria
without hitting Dan

FBI FIELD AGENT
No clear shot I repeat no clear
shot

Nibbs smashes the button down on his walkie talkie
NIBBS
Dammit Stand down until we have
the shot
Dan rips off his shirt body glistening with sweat and blood
DAN MINTNER
Your plan was good Victoria Too
good
Dan kicks Victoria in the tits knocking her back a few feet
She tries to return the attack with a punch of her own but
it’s clear that A she’s a woman and B she doesn’t know how

to fight

VICTORIA
What do you mean “too good”

Dan catches her punch effortlessly - like an older brother
would his younger sibling

He knees her in the stomach causing her to back up a few
more feet ever closer to a giant hook hanging from the
ceiling a pool of molten steel a big steam pump thing and a
random pipe shooting fire out of it Any of these could lead
to her demise

DAN MINTNER
When I saw the stock dropping
the opportunity was too good of
an investment to pass up

She tries to kick him He takes a step back out of the way
and just pushes her down like a child

VICTORIA
What are you saying

He kneels down next to her takes off his shades and grips
her pathetic face bringing it close to his own

DAN MINTNER
You’re looking at the new
majority shareholder of Winthrop
Industries

He slaps her then turns to walk away leaving her
psychologically broken

DAN MINTNER
Nibbs she’s all yours

In super slow motion Victoria reaches up her skirt and pulls
a hidden gun

VICTORIA
You son of a bitch

CARTER NIBBS
Gun

Dan spins back around just in time to see Victoria fire off a
round

He ducks the bullet narrowly missing his head and charges
her

He plows into her so hard that she goes flying back into all
of the death devices we saw her approaching earlier

She’s launched into the air impaling herself on the big
hook suspended just above the pool of molten metal and a few
feet from the steam and fire

DAN MINTNER
For my first action as majority
shareholder in Winthrop
Industries Victoria it brings
me great regret to inform you
that you’re fired

Dan hits a button on the wall next to him and fire shoots out
of the pipes next to Victoria burning her to a crisp

He hits another button that starts some gears in motion
moving the hook Victoria is hanging on back on some type of
conveyer mechanism

DAN MINTNER
Let me show you our severance
package

As she passes through some steam jets a giant buzz saw thing
comes out and saws off one of her legs

DAN MINTNER
You might also be interested in
liquidating your stock options

Dan presses another button and she falls into the pool of
molten hot metal dying a final death

Dan watches her die for a few seconds then once he’s
satisfied that she’s actually dead he rushes to the side of
the wounded Charles Winthrop

Dan removes his gag and unties him
At this point the FBI are all over the place as well

DAN MINTNER
Captain are you alright

WINTHROP
Ill be fine You know Dan I
always wanted a son But that son
of a bitch Jesus Christ saw fit
to only give me a back-stabbing
slut of a daughter

He coughs up a huge amount of blood

WINTHROP
It’s getting cold in here Dan

DAN MINTNER
Medic

WINTHROP
Dan thanks for coming for me
You know that I’1l always
consider you a son for as long as
I live

Winthrop coughs up another gallon of blood and dies there in
the foundry in Dan’s arms

Dan checks his pulse sees that he’s dead and sheds a single
tear Before anyone can see it though his tongue snakes
out and licks it off his stubbled cheek
Dan stands up cracks his neck
DAN MINTNER

We’re gonna need a body bag over

here
EXT WAREHOUSE CRIME SCENE - NIGHT
Cops and FBI Agents crawl all over the place

Dan watches as they wheel out the corpses of Hulk Jesse
Cutter Victoria and Winthrop

Nibbs takes Dan’s official report jots down notes
NIBBS
So what are you going to do with
the company
DAN MINTNER
Sell it at a profit I’m no suit
I don’t belong in that world

Nibbs closes his note pad

NIBBS
Okay that should do it You
might want to hang around your
phone over the next few days
though I’m sure well have more
questions

Dan turns to walk away

CARTER NIBBS
Mintner I’m sorry I misjudged
you

DAN MINTNER
Don’t apologize to me apologize
to him

Dan indicates Winthrop’s corpse with a head nod

CARTER NIBBS
You know I didn’t want things to
end like this

DAN MINTNER

Then you should have listened to
me

Dan slams Nibbs against a cop car

CARTER NIBBS
I know

Dan starts to walk away he’s over this

CARTER NIBBS
Mintner wait

Nibbs fast steps over to Dan

CARTER NIBBS
Look I know we had our
differences on this case and I
know I screwed up But I also
know that you’ve got more raw
talent than I think I’ve ever
seen in the field

DAN MINTNER
Spit it out Nibbs

CARTER NIBBS
Dan I’m offering you a job I
think you’d make a great field
agent and I’d love to have you on
my hand selected team

DAN MINTNER
You’re a funny guy Nibbs

CARTER NIBBS
What do you mean

DAN MINTNER
What don’t I mean

CARTER NIBBS
The offer stands

DAN MINTNER
Nibbs the FBI seems like a real
fun place to work and all but
there’s one problem You guys
have a lot of rules and me well
I only really have one rule

CARTER NIBBS
What’s that Mintner

DAN MINTNER
Fuck you

Dan kicks Nibbs in the balls so hard that he’s lifted off the
ground by at least two or three feet

At the apex of Nibbs’ lift while Dan’s foot is still firmly
planted in his nutsack we freezeframe

Yes we freezeframe in a tribute to those great one-man-army
action movies of yesteryear as the credits roll up the side
of the screen and a badass rock anthem plays on

As we stare at that last image of Dan Mintner kicking Carter
Nibbs right in his balls we wonder what amazing feats of
badassery might be in store for Dan Minter Badass For Hire
