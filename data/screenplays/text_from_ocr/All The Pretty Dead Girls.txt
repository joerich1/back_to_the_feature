FADE IN

INT DARK ROOM - NIGHT

A GIRL hovers on the floor in the dark her white
breath permeates the cold air

Chanting can be heard in an adjacent room terrible demonic
singing getting louder and LOUDER

She hears a blood curdling SCREAM
The girl starts to cry

GIRL
Who are you What do you want

The door begins to slowly open WITH AN EERIE CREAK A beam
of fiery red light STREAMS into the darkened room

It continues to open slowly

DISSOLVE TO

INT SUE’S CAR - DAY

The sun is shining brightly as SUE BARLOW blond
preppy drives her brand new two-door Lexus down the
highway

The trees on either side of the street are a vibrant green
and here and there a few patches of pinkish gold

SUE
Damn it

She stabs at her brakes She sees her exit go by
She takes the next exit ramp speeds up the incline shoots
across a bridge and heads back down the ramp in the other

direction back onto the highway

Sue sees the sign WELCOME TO LEBANON-HOME OF WILBOURNE
COLLEGE and slows down to sixty

At almost the exact same moment she sees the flashing red
lights in her rear view mirror and she hears the WHOOP
WHOOP WHOOP of the police siren

Sue slows down and coasts to a stop on the side of the road

( )

SUE
Aw shit

She grabs a envelope from in between the seats and reaches
for her purse

PERRY HOLLAND young wearing a brown uniform and

sunglasses taps on her driver side window

Sue rolls

her window down partway

SUE
Yes Officer

PERRY
License registration proof of
insurance ma’am

SUE
Oh yes of course Officer just a
moment

She fishes around in the envelope finds the proper

documents

Perry examines Sue’s documents and hands

and hands them to the Officer

SUE (CONTD)
Was I speeding Officer

the window

PERRY
Yes ma’am you were I clocked you
at sixty-five in a fifty zone

SUE
Oh

PERRY
You haven’t been driving long have
you

SUE
No sir I haven’t been driving
long I just got the car last
night in fact

PERRY
Suppose I could just let you go
with a warning Seems like a bad
way to start your school year with
a ticket

them back through

SUE
That would be greatWilbourne
students are probably a real pain
in the ass for you huh

PERRY
Not really There’s hardly ever any
trouble up on campus and the girls
aren’t as big of troublemakers as
boys you know This your first
year then

SUE
Freshman Guilty as charged

PERRY
Youll like it here It’1ll take
some getting used to after
Manhattan because it’s awful quiet
around here You’re probably going
to miss your boyfriend

SUE
I don’t have a boyfriend

Perry takes off his sunglasses and leans on the door
bringing his face closer to Sue’s

PERRY
My name is Perry Holland

Sue buzzes the window all the way down
SUE
Sue Barlow But then you knew that
already didn’t you

PERRY
Nice to meet you

They shake hands and fall silent for a few moments

PERRY watches Sue’s face for a while longer before standing
back to full height

PERRY
You’d best be getting on to school
Ms Barlow

SUE

PERRY

She watches Perry drive away
SUE
I sure hope so
EXT BENTLEY HALL — DAY
Sue glances up at the windows they seem so dark almost
painted black A look of terror comes over her face She is

transfixed to the windows for a few moments

A GIRL’S FACE SCREAMING appears in the windowbut when Sue
looks back up it has disappeared

Sue staggers but manages to make it to the dorm door She
opens it with a bag under each arm propping it open with
her foot

INT BENTLEY HALL — DAY

Sue makes her way up to the second floor wrestling a
rolling suitcase down the hallway towards her assigned room

She smiles at the other girls and nods hello
Up ahead is her roomROOM 227
The door is already open and dance music is playing loudly

Sue walks in

INT ROOM 227 - DAY

Sue sees her boxes and luggage stacked in one corner near a
window

The room is large with two twin beds set out on opposite
sides of the room Each side of the room has bookshelves
built into the walls There are matching closet doors on
either side of the room

SUE
HelloAnybody home Hello

A dark-skinned girl MALIKA walks out of the bathroom
wearing a pair of low-riding jean shorts and a tank top

She is drying her face with a towel

MALIKA
Are you Sue I’m Malika

Sue points over to the side of the room where her stuff is
stacked

SUE
HiIs that my side

MALIKA
Oh yeah I hope you don’t mind
I got here Fridayso I picked
this side of the room I like to be
close to the bathroom

SUE
That’s fine I Don’t even want to
think about unpacking

Sue flops down on her bed and stares up at the ceiling for a
moment

Mailika sits down and folds her towel She closes her laptop
and the music stops

MALIKA
I understand you’re a freshman

SUE
Yeaharen’t you

MALIKA
I’m a sophomore

SUE
I kind of figured I’d be with all
other freshman

MALIKA
No Bentley is mostly for
sophomores and juniors

SUE
Wonder how I got in here then

Malika studies Sue silently
SUE (CONTD)

Well I guess I should be glad So
what’s your major

( )

MALIKA
Poly-Sci

SUE
That’s going to be my major too
prep for law schoolSo where are
you from Malika

MALIKA
Tanzania My parents both work for
the UN I want to work for the
United Nations in under developed
countries Where are you from

SUE
New York

MALIKA
New York City Did your parents
drop you off

SUE
Yes New york City and no I
drove up in a car my grandparents
gave me for graduationa Lexus
I‘ll have it here on campus if you
ever want to get away for a bit

MALIKA
As if the deans would ever allow
that You’ll see Sue It’s pretty
strict around here They’1ll let you
keep the carbut they just won’t
let you drive it

SUE
I‘ll find ways to drive it

MALIKA
So if your Grandparents gave you a
car you must be a little rich
girlWhat did Mommy and Daddy get
you

SUE
My parents are dead

MALIKA
I’m sorry Sue I didn’t--

SUE
Of course you didn’t How would you
know

( )

Sue stands
down at the

the grass

SUE (CONT ’D)
My parents died in a car accident
when I was very youngBut my
mother went to school here

MALIKA
Do you have brothers and sisters

SUE
Just Gran and Grandpa Only family
I have

MALIKA
I can’t imagine I have three
brothers and two sisters and I grew
up with cousins and aunts and
uncles

SUE
Not me My mother was an only
child so there were no cousins

MALIKA
What about your father

SUE
I don’t know My grandparents
rarely speak of him

MALIKA
OhBy the way are you going to
the opening ceremonies tonight

SUE
Well I haven’t really thought
about it I was just thinking as
far as getting here and collapsing

MALIKA
Well I’d like to skip it But it’s
mandatory honey Didn’t you know
If you don’t go they’1ll give you
demerits or something Besides
there might be a protest and I
don’t want to miss that

SUE
Protest Why

and moves from the bed to the window
green campus watching a group of girls across

She gazes

MALIKA
Susan dear clearly you aren’t
reading the official statements the
school sends out

SUE
Wellwe got so many

MALIKA
Joyce Davenport is here to welcome
us all to the new school year

SUE
Okay clue me in Should I know who
she is

MALIKA

Do you watch television

SUE
Actually no My grandparents never
allowed it My Grandfather would
watch the news but that was it

MALIKA
Joyce Davenport is one of
Wilbourne’s esteemed alumnae and a
scary forked-tongue mouthpiece for
the far far radical right

SUE
Never heard of her

MALIKA
She’s made a career out of smearing
people she doesn’t agree with She
doesn’t debate them on the issues
she just calls them names
Traitors Perverts Fagots

SUE
So some of the students might
protest

MALIKA

Wilbourne isn’t exactly a hotbed of
liberalism but there are enough
girls here who oppose Davenport’s
brand of politicking that you might
see a few hecklers

( )

SUE
Well she has a right to her
opinions don’t you think Isn’t
there such a thing as freedom of
speech

MALIKA
Oh of course I don’t want to shut
her up But if she has the right to
spew her views then the students
have a right to say what they think
tooShe’s real scary Sue wait
until you hear her

SUE
Sounds like a real dollI’ve got
some unpacking to doWe can talk
some more later

INT AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

The hall is filled with girls talking laughing and
gossiping The crowd is mainly women but there are a few
young men scattered throughout the audience

DEAN GREGORY a large older gentleman stands up and waddles
across the stage to introduce himself

DEAN GREGORY

Dean Gregory drones on for what seems like days ina
monotone voice
INT AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

The crowd in the audience has a glazed over look on their
faces some fighting sleep and yawning

INT AUDITORIUM - STAGE - NIGHT

DEAN GREGORY (CONT’D)
And finally I’d like to introduce
our keynote speaker for
tonightJoyce Davenport

While applause fills the auditorium JOYCE DAVENPORT walks
across the stage to the podium as if she owns it

She is dressed provocatively black dress matching her black
hair and high heels

When she speaks her voice is shrill like fingernails on a
chalkboard

JOYCE DAVENPORT
I look back fondly on my days at
Wilbourne and what they meant to
me I attribute my success and fame
in the real world to what I learned
here

She continues in the audience Sue and Malika critique her
speech

INT AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

MALIKA
(whispering)
No politicsShe’s staying away
from politics

SUE
You sound as if you’re
disappointed

MALIKA
I was just hoping for a little
drama

INT AUDITORIUM - STAGE - NIGHT

Joyce Davenport finishes up her speech to polite applause
and the group is dismissed

INT AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

One of Malika’s friends SANDY a thin brunette rushes up to
them

SANDY

Sandy

The two girls shake hands

SANDY
It’s time we radicalize this

Sue follows the woman around the building and up a short
flight of stairs that leads to the back of the stage
INT AUDITORIUM - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT

They stop in front of a door The woman raps on it before

letting herself in

WOMAN

JOYCE DAVENPORT(0OS)

INT BACKSTAGE OFFICE - NIGHT
The office is dingy and cramped mirrors on both walls and a
long counter on the wall to her left The walls are plaster

and in places paint is missing where notices have been taped
and later ripped down

SUE

Joyce Davenport is sitting on top of a stool

JOYCE DAVENPORT

She sets the wineglass down and gestures to Sue

a hesitant step forward

Joyce stands up and throws her arms around Sue and then
steps back and searches her face

JOYCE DAVENPORT

JOYCE DAVENPORT (contd)

means driving over to Albany and
catching a flight I should be gone

book just for you I wrote my cell

Sue tries to say something but the words won’t come

( )
15

Suddenly Joyce’s assistants run into the room scooping up
boxes and suitcases

Joyce reaches over to give Sue another hug
JOYCE DAVENPORT
So good to finally meet you

sweetheart

Joyce sweeps out of the room leaving Sue standing there
alone

Sue walks out holding the book

EXT BENTLEY HALL - NIGHT

Sue stops in front of Bentley hall her eyes flicker up to
the third floor window

SUE(VO)
That was my mother’s roomwas the
woman who screamed my motherwas
it Mariclare How would I know
that
A wind suddenly blows Sue shivers The campus is deserted
and the windows seems so dark they blot out the light
behind them

Sue pushes through the front door

EXT THE YELLOW BIRD CAFE - NIGHT

Deputy Sheriff PERRY HOLLAND pulls into a vertical parking
space in front of the cafe

MARJORIE graying dark hair powdered and rouged face
thick in the middle is reading a newspaper at the counter

WALLY balding is washing dishes
The place is deserted
Perry turns off his car and sits there for a moment

He gets out of the car and heads toward the door of the
cafe

INT THE YELLOW BIRD CAFE - NIGHT

A bell rings as Perry pushes through the door He sits down
at one of the round seats and puts his elbows on the
counter

Marjorie Pequon comes through the swinging doors from the
kitchen with a cigarette dangling from her lips looking
tired and grumpy

Shuffling over to where Perry is sitting she whips out her
pad and pencil from the pocket in her graying white apron

MARJORIE
(mumbling around the
cigarette)
The usual

Perry nods Marjorie scribbles it down tears the page off
the pad and shoves it through the small order window
hitting the little bell sitting there

Marjorie leans her elbows on the counter so that she is
nearly nose to nose with Perry

PERRY
How you doing Marjorie

MARJORIE
Tired that’s howWhat you doing
out so late on an off night Perry

PERRY
No food in the house and this way
I get to see you Marj

MARJORIE

If things have got to the point
where you look forward to flirting
with a tired old bag like me
you’re doing something wrong

(beat)
You still hear from Jennifer You

Perry

PERRY

I haven’t heard from her in a
while

(shrugging)
I don’t know Marj maybe I should
have Jennifer’s not losing any
sleep over not marrying methat’s
for sure

( )
17

MARJORIE
You don’t know that PerryShe
could be sitting there every night
hoping you’1ll stop being stubborn
and say the magic words

She shuffles Perry’s glass over to the fountain and refills
it and returns

MARJORIE(CONT’D)
Just tell me to mind my own
business and I’1l shut up

PERRY
It’s okaySo what’s got you so
tired today Marj

MARJORIE
First day of school over at the
college
PERRY

MARJORIE
In and out all afternoon kept me

hopping
Marjorie sighs then smiles

MARJORIE (CONTD)
Those girls are good tippers I
guess they had their welcome thing
tonight

She stretches pressing both hands into the small of her
back

MARJORIE(CONT’D)

Man my back is hurting Be glad

when I get home and can soak in a

hot bath
They both turn when the bell at the front door rings
DR MARSHALL dark haired petite walks in the door
waves at Perry and sits down at one of the booths that run
along the right side of the diner

She reaches into her shoulder bag and pulls out a notebook

( )
18

DR MARSHALL
Just coffee please

Marjorie gives Perry a look of contempt for Dr Marshall

Marjorie brings Dr Marshall her coffee and rejoins Perry at
the counter

All three people in the dining room turn their heads when
the bell over the door rings once again

BONNIE WARNER blond hair pretty steps inside
She speaks with a thick Brooklyn accent

BONNIE
Coffee please to go

Marjorie nods and turns to fill her order

Bonnie’s eyes make contact with Perry seated near her on the
stool She nods at him

PERRY
You go to Wilbourne

She looks at him apprehensively

BONNIE
Yes

PERRY
Out kind of late

BONNIE
I have a job in town

Perry nods returning to the last of the french fries on his
plate

Marjorie hands Bonnie her coffee in a large Styrofoam cup
with a secure lid

MARJORIE
Here you go honey

BONNIE
Thanks

Bonnie suddenly notices Dr Marshall in her booth
watching

( )
19

BONNIE
ShitDr Marshall

Bonnie takes a long breath and walks over to where Dr
Marshall is sitting

DR MARSHALL
Hello Bonnie

BONNIE

dean you saw me

DR MARSHALL

BONNIE

visits to the girl during daytime
hours so you won’t risk getting

BONNIE
Oh thank you Dr Marshall

DR MARSHALL
But the outside gates are locked

BONNIE
No no it’s fine One of the
seniors gave me the code for the
gate

DR MARSHALL

be covering up for three wayward
students

BONNIE
Oh thank you so much Dr
Marshall you’re great

Bonnie waves goodbye to Dr Marshall and turns to head back
out into the night

As she nears the door Perry calls over to her
PERRY
Hey do you need ride back to the
college It’s pretty dark
MARJORIE

It’s okay honey he’s a cop You
can trust him

( )
21

BONNIE
Thanks anyway I have my bike

The bell jingles as she departs the cafe

EXT LEBANON - NIGHT

Bonnie rides her bike through town square wearing a pair of
shorts and a t-shirt a baseball cap pulled down over her
head

She glances at her watch 1030

Bonnie pushes herself legs pumping hard on the pedals

She passes through the center of town and can see the gates
of the school looming in the near distance

She looks at her watch again

BONNIE
Almost ten minutes to spare

She slides off her seat and takes a couple of deep breaths

She walks the bike alongside the tall red brick wall that
surrounds the school

There is a CRUNCHING SOUND off the side of the road
Bonnie is panicked but dismisses it
BONNIE(VO )
Right BonnieLike it’s a bear
Probably a squirrel
She is no more than ten feet from the gate
She hears the NOISE again
BONNIE
Now don’t scare yourself there’s
nothing out there

Bonnie is SUDDENLY bathed in RED LIGHT

BONNIE
What the heck

The strange eerie red glow continues to bathe her
seemingly coming from nowhere

Bonnie turns tries to scream at what she sees but can’t

( )
22

She drops her bike it CLATTERS on the road beside her
Bonnie runsheading for the gates of the college

She hears STEPS coming behind her CRASHING through the
underbrush on the side of the road then directly on her

heels

Bonnie SCREAMS

Sue shuts off the shower steps out and begins towel drying
her hair

INT ROOM 227 - DAY

Sue dresses for class glances down at the cover of Joyce
Davenport’s book

SUE

because it sells books
Sue looks at herself in the mirror

She is wearing a pink t-shirt over khaki pants her blond
hair tied in the back in a ponytail

She flicks on mascara

SUE
Now

Sue gathers up her books
SUE(CONT’D)

Where did Malika say that coffee
was Oh yeah the lounge

INT BENTLEY HALL - LOUNGE - DAY

The lounge is a tiny little room with two plaid upholstered
couches and a big television set mounted on a table

Sue nods at some of the girls as she enters and a few nod
back at her

The air is filled with animated chatter

Sue fills a cup with coffee dumps in some cream and sugar
and takes a sip

GIRL1 in the hallway --

She is obscured by a small huddle of other girls gathered
in the doorway

GIRL1
Oh my God

GIRL2 in the doorway --

GIRL2
No way

Sue looks over at GIRL3 beside her

SUE
What’s going on

GIRL3
I don’t know

Sue takes a few steps toward the excitement as the
chattering of the girls outside of the lounge grows
louder

Sue sees Girl1 now She is tiny no more than eighty
pounds with long brown hair tumbled over a Wilbourne
College sweatshirt

GIRL1
Yes do you know her She was in
lit class last semesterRemember
she was the blond chick with the
thick Brooklyn accent

GIRL4 nods her head in recognition
GIRL4

GIRL5 asks with a wave of her hands

GIRL5
So she skipped out on the welcome
ceremony How did she get away with
that

GIRL1
Tish Lewis signed her in You know
Tish don’t you I can only imagine
how much trouble she’s in

Sue gulps down the rest of the contents of her cup

SUE
(to the group)
Excuse me but I need to get to

to be any classes at the moment

SUE
Why not

CHRISSY HANSON’S face softens as the girls shake hands

CHRISSY
OkayChrissy Hanson Welcome to
Wilbourne But I hope you don’t go

ascend

The doors slide open Sue takes a cautious look and sees
the floor is deserted

With a deep breath Sue steps off the elevator

INT BENTLEY HALL - THIRD FLOOR - DAY

Sue eases down the hall to the fifth door from the end room

She is trembling as she stands outside the door and listens

by that door

at Sue more closely
JOELLE (CONTD)

across the hall

Joelle helps Sue into her room

INT JOELLE’S ROOM - DAY
--And to a futon propped against the wall

JOELLE
You want something to drink

SUE
No I’m goodI guess I just got a
little woozy

JOELLE
It’s okay Everyone’s shaken up
about Bonnie’s death

SUE
So you think she’s dead

JOELLE
Come onYou think she lost all
that blood and is still alive

SUE
Then where’s the body

JOELLE
I think it was a ritual
sacrificeThey needed the body
The blood of a virgin

Sue shivers again

( )
38

SUE
Oh God

JOELLE
Sorry I’m making things worse
aren’t I Did you know her

SUE
Bonnie No

JOELLE
So why were you knocking on her
door

SUE
II thought I saw someone in the
window from outside

JOELLE
Impossible

SUE
Why Didn’t Bonnie have a roommate

JOELLE
No

SUE
Why not

Joelle studies Sue for a moment

JOELLE
What did this person at the window
look like

SUE
It was a girl I know that much

JOELLE
SoThere are lots of girls at
windows in Bentley Hall Why come
up to this one

SUE
Because she was screaming I wanted
to make sure she was okay

JOELLE
You know why Bonnie didn’t have a
roommate

Sue shakes her head

( )
39

JOELLE (CONTD)
That room is supposed to be
haunted No one else would live
there Bonnie said she wasn’t
afraid of ghosts Maybe she was a
little too brave for her own good

SUE
Haunted Okay JoelleI know I’m
a freshman and all but I’m not
going to fall for that You’re
playing a trick on me

JOELLE
(laughing)
I didn’t say I believed it But
that’s the story Every girl on the
third floor hears it when she
first moves in

SUE
How did the story start

JOELLE
Who knowsWilbourne’s been around
a long time But I know it’s been a
bad luck room for a lot of girls
and now of course there’s Bonnie

SUE
This is how legends get started

JOELLE
Of course the worse story was the
girl who got raped in there twenty
years agoright here on campus
You wonder why they’re so strict
about curfews and allowing guests

Sue is now sitting on the edge of the futon

JOELLE (CONTD)
This girl was brutally rapedShe
never came back to school The
story goes her roommate moved out
of there pretty quickly after
thatShe heard things

SUE
Is this documented This rape Or
is it just another story that’s
told

( )
40

JOELLE
I work part-time in the
administration office and I hear
things There are secretaries there
who remember when it happened The
stories got so bad last year that
every girl refused placement there
But Bonnieshe asked for it and
Mrs Oosterhouse let her move in

SUE
Mrs Oosterhouse

JOELLE
Ohthat’s right you’re new You
probably haven’t met the dorm
dragon yetthe dorm supervisor
She’s okay just don’t cross her
Now where was I

SUE
Trying to scare me to death

JOELLE
Oh yesthe haunting of room 323
Some of the girls say they heard
moaning coming from there and
screams Kind of like the face you
say you saw right But Bonnie
always said she never heard
anything and neither have I

SUE
WellI’ve seen that face now
several times

All at once the door opens up and a strawberry blond TISH
LEWIS bursts into the room in a flutter of energy

TISH
(with a thick Texas accent)
Oh my God JoelleYou have no idea
what I have been through today

Tish stops when she sees Sue

TISH(CONT’D)
Oh Hi

JOELLE
Sue this is the now notorious Tish
Lewis my roommate She’s from
Dallas if you couldn’t tell the
minute she opened her mouth

( )
41

TISH
Fuck you Joelle

Tish reaches out to shake Sue’s hand

TISH(CONT’D)
Nice to meet you

Tish plops down on one of the beds

TISH(CONT’D)
Why did I ever agree to sign Bonnie
into the welcome ceremony I will
never do that again The way they
treated me you’d think I was a
serial killer or something

JOELLE
I gather they didn’t expel
youThat’s good

TISH
No but just barely One more
infraction and I am so out of here

Tish sits up and clutches a pillow to her chest pointing at
Sue

TISH(CONT’D)
Let this be a lesson to you Susie
Q You’re a freshman aren’t you

Sue nods

TISH(CONT’D)
Don’t ever do someone a favor if
it means breaking the school’s
precious rules It will come back
and bite you in the ass every
single time

Sue starts to stand to leave

SUE
Well nice to meet you I should
be

JOELLE

Sue thinks she may have seen the
ghost of room 323

( )

TISH
Really What did you see Susie Q

SUE
I don’t know

JOELLE
Go ahead and tell her Sue

Joelle waves her hand and winks at Sue

JOELLE (CONTD)
Tish is one of those girls who’s
heard the screaming herself

Suddenly Sue looks at Tish with new eyes

TISH
Joelle acts like I’m crazyBut I
know what I’ve heard and I’ve
heard someone screaming in that
room Before and after Bonnie’s
disappearance

SUE
Youve really heard a girl
screaming in there

TISH
Yep Screaming for her life I am
telling you

JOELLE
Then why hasn’t anyone else heard
it

TISH

Do I look like agent Mulder It was
last semester and it was scary as
hell I was the only person on the
floor pretty much

Tish shivers

TISH(CONT’D)
Oh it was just terrible horrible
like someone being murdered I went
out in the hall and it was coming
from Bonnie’s roomonly I knew
Bonnie wasn’t there she was at
work I didn’t know what to do so I
went down and got Mrs Oosterhouse
Of course when we went into the

(MORE )

( )
43

TISH(CONT’D) (cont’d)
room there was nothing thereOf
course Oostie thought I was nuts

SUE
And youve heard it since Bonnie
went missing

TISH
Yep First day of classes as a
matter of fact I kept running
around asking girls if they heard
anything but they all said no

SUE
I saw the face at the window that
day

JOELLE

It’s not that I don’t believe
especially not with the fact that I
am certain Bonnie was the victim of
some witchcraft ritual

TISH
Well that much is pure speculation

JOELLE
True but if they slashed her up in
front of the school why take the
body

TISH
Evidence

JOELLE
Well something’s queer about that
room that’s for sure If Sue is
saying she’s seen someone screaming
in the window

Tish moves around on the bed so that she is lying on her
stomach her chin in her hands staring at Sue

TISH
Did you get a good look at the face
in the window

SUE
No not reallyI was out on the
sidewalk by the parking lot I just
happened to look up and saw
someoneA girlI know that
much

( )
44

TISH
That room is haunted I told you
so Joelle

SUE
(finally getting up)
WellI’ve got to get to class
Thanks for the stories see you
guys later

Pierre paces the room like he may explode at any minute

Bernadette eyes closed perfectly still other than her
fingers working her rosary beads lies in a hospital bed
Her wrists are bandaged

Bernie’s wrists and ankles

PIERRE

saidhysteria That’s what he
called it He said it was possible

MADIE

Madie continues to clack the rosary beads
Pierre grows increasingly annoyed

PIERRE
Stop it

Pierre reaches over and grabs Madie’s hands

MADIE
Let go

Pierre lets go of her hands and Madie starts back to
clacking again

Strangely Bernie’s hands stop twitching at the very moment
Maddie’s stop and begin again at the same time as well

BERNADETTE
(eyes closed)
She spoke to me Papa She told me
I am blessed
Pierre sits down in the other chair head in his hands

Madie continues to clack her rosary beads

Mike glances around and leans across the table

MIKE

Mike makes a circular motion with his index finger beside
his right temple

MIKE
Exactly Mom thinks it’s a miracle
and I don’t know what Dad thinks
Bernie swears the Virgin Mary told
her something but she won’t tell
anyone She says the Virgin swore
her to secrecy

BILLY
Maybe she’s just looking for
attention

MIKE
I thought that too Mom’s always
been a little nuts about the Church
stuff but lately Bernie’s been
kind of that way too

( )

BILLY
Maybe she’s telling the truth

MIKE
Don’t even say that man not even
as a joke

BILLY
I’m not joking You’ve got to keep
an open mind

MIKE
I don’t know These are my choices
I either believe my sister is some
kind of saint or she’s insane

Billy’s eyes follow Mike as he walks out of the cafe side
stepping to avoid a young woman who is walking in as he is
walking out

BILLY (V0O)
Now that is one hot babe

Billy tosses down a ten on the table finishes his Coke
wipes his mouth and stands up

One quick glance in the mirror on the wall confirms his hair
looks good and there’s no ketchup smeared on his chin

He strolls over to the counter
Marjorie watches Billy and gives a crooked grin
Billy slides onto a stool next to the knockout GIRL Sue

BILLY
HeyI’m Billy

SUE
(looking down at her menu)

BILLY
(putting out his hand)
Billy HoneycuttI don’t recognize
you so my mental calculations tell

Finally Sue looks up She doesn’t take his hand right away

SUE
Well with all that mental
calculation going on in your head

orders

Sue shrugs and gratefully accepts her cup of coffee from
Marjorie and takes a sip

puts out a hand to stop her

JOELLE
Please I’m not making this up

MRS OOSTERHOUSE
Do you know how often I get girls
coming to me upset about that
so-called haunted room 323
JOELLE
Please Mrs Oosterhouse Please go
check

Mrs Oosterhouse gives Joelle a dramatic sigh reaches behind
her door and retrieves a set of keys

She waddles into the hallway and closes the door behind her
with a bang

MRS OOSTERHOUSE
Come on
INT BENTLEY HALL - THIRD FLOOR - CONTINUOUS
They make their way from the elevator to room 323

MRS OOSTERHOUSE
I don’t hear anything

Oostie fits the key in the lock and turns
Joelle keeps close behind her peering over her shoulder

Oostie takes a quick glance inside

( )

MRS OOSTERHOUSE
Nobody

She flings open the door and steps into the room

Joelle follows apprehensively

INT ROOM 323 - CONTINUOUS

The room is small with nowhere to hide

The closet is open no one is there

The bathroom is open no one hiding in the shower

The bed is secured to the floor with wraparound wood no
place to hide

MRS OOSTERHOUSE
You see I told you Nobody is
here

Oostie lets out another long dramatic sigh

MRS OOSTERHOUSE (CONTD)
I don’t know what it is that turns
seemingly rational college girls
into raving hysterics

JOELLE
I heard it I heard someone
screaming

MRS OOSTERHOUSE
Maybe it was from outside

JOELLE
No it came from this room

MRS OOSTERHOUSE
You can see that’s impossible No
one is here

JOELLE
Then someone was here earlier and
they left when I went down to get
you

MRS OOSTERHOUSE
Come on I shouldn’t have let you
in here But I wanted to settle
this once and for all

( )
59

Joelle reaches out and takes hold of Oostie’s arm

JOELLE
You’ve been here long enough You
know this isn’t just one girl’s
delusion You know what happened in
this room twenty years ago You
know there’s something bizarre
going on

MRS OOSTERHOUSE
I know no such thing

JOELLE
Bonnie Warner was killed by
witches That’s the buzz around the
school There is something
unworldly happening on this campus

MRS OOSTERHOUSE
Now I know youre crazy

Joelle lets go of Oostie’s arm and with a look of terror
steps backward

JOELLE
You’re part of it aren’t you
That’s your job to guard this
room

MRS OOSTERHOUSE
We have to leave now

Joelle follows Oostie out of room 323

INT BENTLEY HALL - THIRD FLOOR - CONTINUOUS

She hurries back to her own room and barricades herself
inside

INT JOELLE’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Joelle picks up her cellphone and presses in Tish’s number
but gets her voice mail

JOELLE
Tishwhere the fuck are you When
you get this message get back here
as soon as possible I’ve heard the
screaming Oostie took me in the
roomI think she’s in on itAll
of them maybe

( )

Joelle hears a BEEPShe looks down at her phone
CALL DROPPED

She hears something else The SOUND of a door being unlocked
and opened across the hallway room 323

Joelle peers through the peephole in her door
She sees someone going back into the room

Joelle opens her door

INT BENTLEY HALL - THIRD FLOOR - CONTINUOUS
--She stands bravely in the hallway outside of room 323
JOELLE
I know you think I’m crazy but I
want answers I’m going to talk to
Dean Gregory

The door remains ajar Joelle can see light from inside not
an electric light but more like candlelight

Joelle pulls the door open a bit more and looks inside She
sees a candle on the table at the far end of the room
flickering eerily casting shadows all across the room
A VOICE SPEAKS
VOICE
Is this what you meant Joelle

INT ROOM 323 - CONTINUOUS

--Joelle takes a step into the room trying to discern who
is speaking
VOICE
Is this what you meant by
Witchcraft

SUDDENLY the door in Joelle’s hands surges forward
threatening to pin her in the door frame

She leaps aside to avoid it now she is totally in the room

The door CLANGS shut with the familiar LOCKING SOUND

( )
61

JOELLE
Let me out of here

She tries the door handle but it won’t budge
She bangs on the door

JOELLE (CONT ’D)
Please someone Is someone out
there

VOICE
NoONLY IN HERE

Joelle spins around

JOELLE
Who’s in here Mrs Oosterhouse is
it you

Joelle lunges for the window but it is locked too She tries
frantically to open it

Something stirs in the darkness

Joelle fumbles along the wall for the light switch but
can’t find one

She begins to cry

VOICE
Don’t cryYou’re here with us
now Joelle

JOELLE
Who are you

VOICE
In time Joelle For now you are
herein the most important room
in the most important dorm We
didn’t expect you but we’re glad
you came

Something nightmarish moves towards Joelle from out of the
shadows

Joelle screams

INT ROOM 227 - THREE WEEKS LATER - NIGHT

Sue rubs cold cream on her face and looks over her shoulder
at Malika in the doorway to their bathroom

MALIKA
So it went well This seems to be
turning seriousYour third date

SUE
Well we’ll see if he asks me out
again

MALIKA

Why would he not
Malika laughs leaning on the door frame her voice teasing

MALIKA(CONT’D)
Is it not every high school boy’s
dream to date a college girl Do I
get to meet this boy someday Or
does he have two heads or
something

Sue just looks in the mirror and continues to put on her
cold cream without a word

MALIKA(CONT’D)
Well Do I get to meet him

SUE
Of course next time I really like
being with Billy He comes off like
a jock but he’s really just a
country hick He’s very sweet
you’1l like him

Sue washes off her face and turns off the water She grabs a
towel and walks back into the bedroom

Malika moans and flops down on the bed
MALIKA
I wouldn’t mind meeting a man
myself Damn girl’s school
Sue laughs and sits opposite of her brushing her hair
SUE

Come onThere are plenty of boys
in Lebanon

( )
63

MALIKA

No offense Sue but I don’t want a
boyI want a manA man who
knows what he’s doing Last summer
I met this man in Rome Leonardo

(she winks)
Italian men know how to treat a
womannot like clumsy boys

SUE
Billy’s just fine for me right now
We go to the movies out to eat we
hold handsI think I’m falling
for him

MALIKA
Well all I can say is I hope my
parents are still stationed in Rome
next summer

Sue pulls her laptop across the bed and towards her and
clicks on her e-mail program

SUE
Damn still no response from Joyce
Davenport Nearly three weeks and
no reply

MALIKA
I wouldn’t worry she’s a busy
woman She’1ll answer when she gets
a chance

Both girls are exhausted so they turn out the lights

INT PERRYS CAR - NIGHT

Perry turns off the ignition to his car and parks in front
of his father’s residence The pine trees cast long shadows
across the house that is completely dark

Perry sits and stares for a few moments

The yard is in disarray grass overgrown leaves cluttering
the lawn in piles trash scattered about

Perry continues to sit in deep thought

He finally forces himself to open the car door

EXT MILES HOLLANDS RESIDENCE - CONTINUOUS

--Perry heads up the walk kicking aside damp leaves on the
steps He slips his key into the lock ringing the doorbell
as he opens the door

INT MILES HOLLAND’S RESIDENCE - CONTINUOUS
The living room is dark the curtains drawn

PERRY
DadIt’s Perry Are you here

MILES(0S)
In the kitchen son

With a sigh of relief Perry switches on the overhead light
in the living room and heads to the kitchen in the back

KITCHEN

Perry sighs again Dishes are stacked in the sink the table
is piled with papers

PERRY
Dad what are you doing in here in
the dark

Miles is sitting at the table straining his eyes as he
reads through a stack of papers in his hand

Miles looks up at Perry

MILES
Oh right I guess I was so
engrossed here I didn’t notice the
sun had set

Perry switches on the lamp over the table an amber light
suddenly suffuses the room

Perry looks down at the papers that are piled haphazardly
Old battered file folders a stack of newspaper clippings
and photocopies of photographs
Perry sits down at the table

PERRY

Dad I’m worried about you sitting
here

( )
65

MILES
(waving his hand)
Son I’m on to something

PERRY
Dad look you’re not eating
you’re not taking care of yourself

MILES
Perry I tell you I’m on to
something

PERRY

(making a face)
On to something about what

MILES
(muttering shuffling papers
around)
The collegeThose missing girls

PERRY
Dad only one girl is missing
Bonnie Warner

Miles pushes a report towards Perry that says TOP SECRET

MILES
You’re wrong Two more girls

Perry glances down at the report

PERRY
Joelle BartlettPatricia
LewisDad why didn’t you tell
me

MILES
As a favor to the college It was a
state police call not mine

PERRY
Dad if people find outhell
when they find outThey’re gonna
be royally pissed And with good
reason

MILES
Yes I agree The dean understood
that eventually this would come
out but he asked that we sit on
the news for a bit

( )
66

PERRY

How long have they been missing
MILES

Not sure They didn’t even make

the report until the girl’s
parents called worried about
their daughters Finally they
admitted to the parents that they
hadn’t been in class

PERRY
Jesus

MILES
And get this Perry The girls were
roommates And they lived right
across the hall from the first girl
who went missingThe one that
left all the blood all over the
street

PERRY
So you suspect a connection

MILES
(nodding)
The state is trying to take over
the whole investigation But I just
can’t let the thing go

Miles gathers the papers on the table into a pile

MILES
I’ve been digging Son there’s a
cycleevery twenty years or so
Something happens to the girls up
there at the college every twenty
years or so

PERRY
What are you talking about

MILES
I know it sounds crazyBut when
Bonnie Warner disappeared I said
to myself This has happened
before

PERRY
Dad what do you mean A girl
disappeared before from the
college

( )
67

MILES
You don’t remember You were young
but it made the news It was almost
twenty years ago almost to the
month

PERRY
(closing his eyes for a
moment )
Yeah I vaguely remember a girl
going missing thereit was right
after you were elected sheriff

MILES
That’s right It was one of my
first cases Margaret Latham An
all-points bulletin went out
searching for her

PERRY
They found her eventually
rightbadly mutilated

MILES
That’s right Limbs cut off blood
drained Body was found in Lake
Bessett No one ever charged with
the crime

PERRY
But that hardly makes it a cycle
Dad One girl’s murder doesn’t
necessarily connect to the
disappearances of three others
twenty years later

MILES
I have a long memory Perry That’s
why I’ve made such a damned good
sheriff People forget things But
I remember I make connections
(handing Perry a sheet of
paper )
I recalled that another girl was
reported missing soon after
Margaret Latham disappeared See
the report

Perry glances down at the report questioningly

PERRY
Yes but this girl eventually
turned up okay It says here her
(MORE )

( )
68

PERRY (cont’d)
parents told police she had run
away from the college and returned
home

MILES
YesBut why did she run away

PERRY
Come on Dad now you’re really
starting to sound nutty

MILES

(shouting)
I have a long memory I’ve been in
the vault combing through all our
old cases I’ve been at the
library going through microfilmed
newspapers This has been a
recurring pattern at that school I
remember

He shoves a well-thumbed folder cracking with age across
the table at Perry

MILES (CONTD)
If you read that you’1ll see that
almost twenty years before Margaret
Latham’s disappearance there was
another curious event at Wilbourne
People forget but I remember

Perry leafs through the contents of the file
A smiling girl in a 1960’s flip hairdo in one photo

In another she stares glassy-eyed her face swollen in
death

Perry shudders

MILES
I had to really rack my brain to
remember but I did it I knew it
was there deep downand the files
corroborated it

PERRY
Okay so girls have gone missing or
murdered from Wilbourne before
Still to call it a cycle

( )

MILES
You need more son When I suspected
I might be on to something I went
back again in the files Sometimes
it was twenty years Sometimes it
was only nineteen

Miles begins tossing files at Perry so fast he practically
doesn’t have time to catch them in his arms

MILES (CONTD)
1962 1943 1923 1904

Perry leans forward and places his hand on his father’s
forearm lightly

PERRY
Dad I think you might be tired
Maybe you should go lay down get
some rest

MILES
I don’t need any goddamn rest I
need to figure out what the hell is
going on at that school

PERRY
(standing)
Have you eaten anything tonight
Dad Let’s go and get a chili
burger and fries at the Bird

MILES

Haven’t you heard what I’ve been
telling you You’ve got to admit
this is too weird to just chalk up
to coincidence

(banging his fist on the

table)
Explain why the townsfolk seem to
forget Explain why you didn’t
remember Margaret Latham going
missing until I reminded you

PERRY
Dad I was eleven

MILES
Then explain to me why the
selectmen didn’t remember Not even
Veronica Thomas whose father was
the sheriff before me

( )
70

PERRY
Well if they did acknowledge it
enrollment would certainly decline

MILES
I have a feeling enrollment is the
least of their concerns

PERRY
Dad you think the school has
something to do with the deaths
don’t you

MILES
(standing rubbing his
forehead)
Or at least covering them up

PERRY
You okay Dad

MILES
Headaches Too much reading

PERRY
Let’s go to the Bird you need to
get out of the house

MILES
The strangest part is why we don’t
remember I don’t understand
itit just doesn’t make any
sense

PERRY
Dad you need to eat

MILES
I’m not hungry
(putting a hand to his head
again)
Damn headache Maybe I will go lie
down and take some Motrin

PERRY
Good idea I’1ll clean up this mess
Then maybe I can make us both some
eggs

MILES
(shaking a finger at Perry)
You gotta admit I’m on to
something Perry

( )
71

PERRY
Well talk about it after you rest
awhile

Miles grunts and heads down the hall to his room

Biting his lower lip Perry starts scrubbing the dishes in
the sink Milk rings stare at him from the bottom of the
glasses

He decides to just fill the sink with hot water and let the
dishes soak

Back at the table he lifts a yellowed folder he knew had
come from the station files

BARLOW MARICLARE was written on the tab

PERRY (VO)
Barlow That name is familiar Why
Where do I know that name from

Perry opens the file and looks at the date

PERRY (VO)

Twenty years ago Every twenty
years or so something happens to
the girls up at the college

Perry thinks for a moment

PERRY (VO)

The girl in the white Lexus Her
name was Barlow Susan Barlow with
a Manhattan address Might there be
a connection between her and this
Mariclare Barlow who was also
listed with a Manhattan address

Perry continues to read His eyes widen
PERRY (VO)
Dear God could Dad be right Every

twenty years or so

The overhead light flickers Perry shudders as he continues
to read

INT DR MARSHALL’S APARTMENT - DAY

Dr Marshall frowns at her computer screen She pours
herself a glass of wine and takes a sip

On her screen is one paragraph of her long overdue book She
swears under her breath

DR MARSHALL
I’ve got to get this book done
damn it I wrote this paragraph
three weeks ago I got
nothingshit

She continues to labor over her keyboard when her doorbell
unexpectedly rings

DR MARSHALL
That’s odd I hardly ever have
visitors here Probably a salesman
or even worst a Jehovah’s Witness

She sits her glass down on the counter and heads for the
door

She opens the door and standing there is FATHER ORTIZ
Latino with graying dark black hair He is stocky and is
dressed in a heavy gray overcoat and black slacks

DR MARSHALL
Yes may I help you

FATHER ORTIZ
You don’t remember me But then I
should not expect you to after so
many years And we only knew each
other so very briefly

Ginny’s jaw drops

DR MARSHALL
Father Ortiz From Los Zapatos

FATHER ORTIZ
Ah you remember me I am glad May
I come in I would like so much to
speak with you

DR MARSHALL
Yes of course

Father Ortiz enters Ginny takes his coat and drapes it over
a reclining chair

( )
73

FATHER ORTIZ
Thank you for receiving me
unexpectedly I wanted to call but
your number is not listed and I
did not want to wait to reach you
tomorrow at the college

DR MARSHALL
Sit down Father may I get you
anything

FATHER ORTIZ
No thank you It is good to see you
Dr Marshall The years have been
very good to you

DR MARSHALL
Oh please you’re far too kind
(sitting down opposite him on
the sofa)
Now for Heaven’s sake tell me
what you are doing here in Lebanon

Father Ortiz stares over her shoulder for a moment

FATHER ORTIZ
Dr Marshall

DR MARSHALL
Please Ginny

FATHER ORTIZ
GinnyI will start by apologizing
to you for not saying an
appropriate good-bye to you in Los
Zapatos The archbishop was very
insistent that the girls and I get
to Mexico City immediately

DR MARSHALL
No need to apologize Father I
certainly understood The nosy
American researcher was hardly a
priority especially when the
archbishop calls

FATHER ORTIZ
I have you know followed your
career with great interest anda
little pride I must confess that
since then I have read your books
and they are very interesting Of
course the official Church

(MORE)
( )
74

FATHER ORTIZ (contd)
position is that you are a heretic
but I know many of my fellow
brethren in the Church have read
and debated your works

DR MARSHALL
Well that’s all I ever wanted To
bring about discussion

FATHER ORTIZ

And you needn’t worry Ginny I am
not here to convert you or lecture
youunless of course you want to
recant and come back into the
embrace of Mother Church No I
thought not but it doesn’t hurt to
ask as you say in this country

DR MARSHALL
But none of this explains why you
are here tonight Father or what
was so important it couldn’t wait
until morning

Father Ortiz studies her for a moment

FATHER ORTIZ
Why did you never publish the book
you were working on in Los Zapatos

Ginny shifts uncomfortably in her seat

DR MARSHALL
I’m still working on it

She glances over at her computer then back at Father Ortiz

DR MARSHALL(CONT’D)
Funny you should ask about it I’ve
been sitting here tonight trying to
figure out how to move forward on
it

FATHER ORTIZ
I’ve always anxiously awaited that
particular book Dr erGinny

DR MARSHALL
Why did you come here Father

( )
75

FATHER ORTIZ
I understand you have been trying
to see Bernadette DeSalis

DR MARSHALL
Gayle Honeycutt a local reporter
had told me about her but so far
they have refused to talk to me
And how did you know that

FATHER ORTIZ
Ah God knows everythingand
perhaps He whispered it to me No
I am acquainted with the DeSalis
family I was brought in when the
local bishop learned of her
experience And so I have
interviewed her extensively

DR MARSHALL
You’ve moved up pretty far in the
church hierarchy from your humble
days in Los Zapatos Father You’re
here to investigate the sighting

FATHER ORTIZ
I suppose some consider me now an
expert But it is you Ginny who
are the real expert You would be
doing me a huge favor if you
interviewed Bernadette and
compared her story to the other
girls you have studied

DR MARSHALL

I don’t understand In Los Zapatos
you wouldn’t let me anywhere near
the girls who saw the Virgin And
now you’re offering to let me
interview Bernadette

(leaning back in her chair)
Come on Father what gives

FATHER ORTIZ
Suffice it to say Ginny that
Mother Church has her reasons Will
you come

DR MARSHALL

Well of course I’d like to
interview her

( )

FATHER ORTIZ
There is much to discuss when you
come

DR MARSHALL
Terrific When

FATHER ORTIZ

(rising from his chair)
I will call tomorrow and make the
arrangements I wanted our first
meeting to be in person I wanted
to see for myself if you were still
the good honest woman I met in Los
Zapatos Thank you Ginny

Ginny walks Father Ortiz to the door

DR MARSHALL
Thank you Father

He turns to look at her his face is now grave

FATHER ORTIZ
Save your thanks for after you have
spoken to Bernadette Ginny You
may not be so grateful after you
hear what she has to say

She watches Father Ortiz walk down the stairs into the

night

INT BENTLEY HALL BASEMENT - CLOSET - NIGHT

Tish Lewis sits on the cold floor She listens intently to

things in the dark
Voices drift through cracks in the wall

TISH
That’s Dean Gregory’s voice And
that’s his wife And that’s the
nurse from the infirmary Poppy
Cochrane

Tish again hears that awful ritual chanting
TISH(CONT’D)
They killed herDean Gregory and
the others killed Joelle They
drank her blood

Tish again hears VOICES from the adjoining room

( )
77

VOICES(0S)
Take this and drinkThe blood is
our life

TISH(CONT’D)

God I know what they are doing
They’re passing a cup around a
cup of blood and each one is
drinking and saying the wordsBut
they’re keeping me alive why

(beat)
So they can kill me too when they
get readyAnd drink my blood

The only light filters through the small slats above Tish’s
head

She sees only rough contours of her hands the metal pail
she uses for a toilet and the walls that enclose her

The space is very small about five feet by five feet No
bigger than a closet

TISH(CONT’D)
They probably expect me to go mad
in hereAnd who wouldn’t
trapped in a place so small so
darkWell they’re wrong
They hadn’t reckoned on dealing
with a strong-willed Southern girl

She again listens to the voices Dean Gregory Mrs Gregory
Nurse Cochrane

There is a familiar creak outside the locked door
In seconds the iron door is swinging open

The FIGURE robed and hooded face hidden carries a tray
in

The figure places the tray on the floor It moves slowly
seems to be stout maybe even fat

Tish bends over eating the bread like a dog might tearing
it apart with her teeth not using her hands

The figure bends with some difficulty to retrieve the pail

Tish watches the figure leave the cell with a clang and
takes a sip of water from a large mug

The figure comes back inside It stands over Tish for moment
before putting the pail back down

( )
78

Tish plays crazy looks up at the figure with animal eyes

FIGURE
Pitiful slutUseless creature

The figure sits the pail down on the floor and leaves the
room clanging the door shut behind

TISH(VO)
Oostie That’s Mrs Oosterhouse I
could take Oostie I could totally
take out Oostie

Tish pulls down her ratty dirty jeans to squat over the
pail to pee She feels something sharp sticking in her
thigh she winces She looks down

One end of the pail’s metal handle is coming loose

In the very dim light Tish studies it It breaks off in her
hands It’s edge is sharp very sharp

A little trickle of blood runs down from a cut on her
fingertip

She easily secures the handle back to the side of the pail

TISH(VO)
That should hold long enough for
that bitch to carry it out of the
room and dump it one more
timeBut it could serve as a
weapona very sharp weapon

EXT LEBANON - DAY

Billy Honeycutt sits on a bench in the center of town He
looks at his watch and shakes his head

BILLY
Damn it’s ten ‘til five She said
shed be here at four thirty

Billy continues to sit on the bench He looks at his watch
again

BILLY (CONT ’D)
Shit501 Where the hell is she

HEIDI blond beautiful bouncy breasts barely covered

by a seersucker blouse appears from nowhere behind him and
surprises Billy

( )
79

HEIDI
Well hello Billy

Billy jumps clearly shocked to see Heidi behind him arms
akimbo

BILLY
OhHey

HEIDI
Waiting for your new girlfriend Or
is she standing you up

BILLY
She is not standing me up

HEIDI
I don’t knowbut I came by a half
hour ago and saw you sitting here
And you’re still here now

BILLY
So A guy can’t sit on a bench ona
nice day

HEIDI
Not a guy like you Why aren’t you
at football practice

BILLY
It’s a day off Besides it’s none
of your business

Suddenly Heidi breaks into tears throwing her arms around
Billy

HEIDI
Oh BillyThis is such a mistake
We should be together

BILLY
Let go Heidi

He pushes her away but she moves in closer trying to kiss
him on the lips

BILLY
Jesus Heidi

He manages to finally push her away Just as he does he

sees Sue sitting in her car across the street watching the
whole scene

( )
80

BILLY (CONT’ )
Fuck
(standing)
Heidi turns and sees Sue as well
HEIDI
Is that her Is that Miss Fucking
Wilbourne

Sue is in no hurry to get out of her car she just sits and
glares at Heidi

Sue keeps glaring at Heidi until she finally stamps her
foot

HEIDI
Fuck you both

Heidi hurries down the street

Sue gets out of her car struggling to keep her emotions in
check as she crosses the street

Billy plays it off as if Heidi had never been there

BILLY
Hey pretty lady

Sue smiles and lets Billy kiss her on the cheek

SUE
What was that all about

BILLY
Ex-girlfriend

Sue looks down the street to where Heidi is a small pitiful
figure in the distance

She continues to stare
BILLY
Sue don’t worry She means nothing
to me now
Sue turns to look Billy in the eyes
SUE
Just how many broken hearts have

you left in your wake Billy
Honeycutt

( )
81

BILLY
Not that manyI know hard to
believe given how good-looking I
am
Billy laughs but Sue doesn’t share his amusement

Sue swallows and closes her eyes seems distant for a
moment

BILLY
You okay

SUE
Just daydreaming I guess

Billy slips his right hand over hers

BILLY
About me I hope

They walk hand and hand for a while without speaking

They pass the drugstore and the AandP and round the corner in
front of the post office

BILLY
I was afraid you weren’t going to
show up

SUE

Oh RightI’m sorry I was late
But I finally heard from Joyce
Davenport

BILLY
Well awesome Did she tell you
anything about your mother

SUE
It was just a short e-mail
responding to mine from weeks ago
She said she was sorry it took her
so long to get back to me that
she’s been on tour but said she
would call and we’d set up a time
to talk

BILLY
Cool

( )

Sue nods

SUE
I guess so Anyway I was late
because I wanted to write her back
right away and I told her I’d been
reading her book And you know
what She e-mailed me right back
She was thrilled I was reading
Smear

BILLY
Obviously you didn’t tell her what
you thought of it

SUE
You know I can’t figure her out On
one hand I think she’s horrible
And on the other hand I don’t
know

BILLY
You know what I think it is I
think because Joyce was your
mother’s friend you want to really
like her That’s what it is You
want to like her and find good
things about her

smiles up at Billy and cups his cheek in her hand

SUE
I’m glad we met

BILLY
Yeah me too

Billy brings her hand up to his lips and kisses it

BILLY (CONT ’D)

You want to go over to the Yellow
Bird for a coke I told Mike we
might stop by

SUE
I don’t think Mike likes me I can
tell

BILLY
Sure he does You two just don’t
know each other very well yet
That’s all

( )
83

SUE
Mike doesn’t like me Billy

BILLY
He’s just going through some family
stuff His sister is sick

SUE
Bernadette

BILLY

SUE

possibly know his sister’s name I
mean I barely know Mike

BILLY
Well come on let’s go He’ll be
in a better mood if I buy hima
chili burger and fries Once you
guys get to know each other you’1ll
be best of friends

Billy tugs at her hand to get her to move on but Sue stands
her ground

SUE
Did he like Heidi

BILLY

SUE

The Yellow Bird is empty except for Mike DeSalis sitting in
a booth staring into his glass of Coke

Marjorie is in the back doing the dishes
Wally is behind the counter

WALLY

Wally hustles back behind the counter

He glances back over at Mike His head is now down on the
table

Wally carries the ice water over to Mike and sits it down on
the table

WALLY (CONT ’D)
There you go son

Mike picks up his head and smiles a pasty weak smile at
Wally

Mike’s eyes are glowing bright red

In an instant there are flames smoke and cinders falling
from a fire that blazes across the ceiling

Beyond the cafeevery building downtown is on fire Even
the trees and grass in the square are aflame

( )
87

There is ROAR as the gas tank of a truck ignites and blows
sky high

There are voices begging and crying out for help
All of sudden there is a sound of a trumpet blaring

MIKE
Thanks Mr Bingham

The flames are goneWally stands uneasy on his feet and
watches the boy drink the water

WALLY
What the fuck

MIKE
I have the worst dreamsAnd my
headfeels like it’s going to split
wide open and sometimes I wish it
would

Wally steadies himself against the back of the booth

The bell over the door ringsWally starts to turn to see
who it is Mike grabs his arm digging his nails into the
skin

WALLY
Hey

Wally tries to yank his arm away He turns back in shock
only to see Mike’s eyes have widened in absolute terror his
mouth forming a perfect circle

His pupils are completely dilated and his face is
completely drained of color

Billy is standing at the doorway A blond girl stands at his
side

BILLY
Grill still open Wally

Wally continues to stare at Mike who is now gasping for
air

Wally manages with a final jerk to wrench his shoulder out
of Mike’s grasp Bloody half moons are cut in his skin from
Mike’s nails

Mike is stuttering in utter terror his finger pointing at
the front door

( )
88
WALLY
Mike it’s Billy

Mike starts screaming He stands up from the booth as if to
run but seems unable to move

He falls straight backward

Wally grabs for the boy but his fingers just brush against
Mike’s shirt

There is A HORRIBLE THUD as Mike’s head hits the floor

His head actually bounces up and falls again with another
thud

Wally and Billy run to Mike’s side

BILLY
Mike Mike are you okay

Mike opens his eyes and smiles up at them
MIKE
Everything is going to be all right
now
Mike’s eyes roll back in his head
Behind them Sue is screaming

Wally starts performing CPR on Mike

WALLY
Call an ambulance Don’t die Mike

die

With shaking fingers Sue flips open her cell phone and
presses 911

SUE

Yellow Bird diner Mike DeSalis

breathingPlease hurry

Sue hangs up and watches Wally give Mike CPR

BILLY

Marjorie appears from behind the counter her hands wet and
soapy

89

MARJORIE

Wally continues to work on Mike but seems to be having no
luck

WALLY
Come oncome on

Sue sags down into the booth nearest the door wipes her
eyes with her hands

SUE(VO)
Why do I feel as if this is my
fault

BILLY

Come on Mike Come on buddy I
know you can do it

Sue hears Marjorie dialing a phone in the kitchen speaking
in a hushed voice

Outside an ambulance siren can be heard

Paramedics rush out They start to carry equipment into the
beauty shop

SUE (CONT ’D)

Sue reaches the door of the beauty shop and looks inside
Paramedics are bending over a girl on the floor
Sue sees the girl’s face
It is Heidi
Behind her she hears the whine of another ambulance She
glances up the street and sees this one stops at the Yellow
Bird
SUE(VO)

feel as if I am the cause of it

He gestures for Ginny to follow him

FATHER ORTIZ
She’s in here

Ginny takes a deep breath and follows Father Ortiz through
the kitchen rounds a corner into the living room

In the living room are dozens of vases filled with aromatic
purple flowers

FATHER ORTIZ
(over his shoulder)
Strangest thingA day after
Bernadette came home from the
hospital all the bushes in the
yard began sprouting new flowers

Bernadette is seated on the couch her hands folded in her
lap clasping a rosary

She is dressed in a long white dress her dark hair tied
back in a ponytail

Her parents are seated on either side of her on the couch

( )
91

FATHER ORTIZ
Bernadette this is the lady I told
you about She is a good lady Her
name is Virginia Marshall Her
parents named her for Our Lady

Bernadette smiles

DR MARSHALL
Hello

BERNADETTE
Hello

FATHER ORTIZ
Bernadette I was hoping you’d let
Dr Marshall ask you some
questions

PIERRE
(anxious )
You sure Father You sure this
won’t upset her She’s coming along
so much better now

DR MARSHALL
I won’t upset her I just want to
hear whatever she might want to
tell me

MADDIE
And she has a great deal to say
She has a message from Our Holy
Virgin Mother A very important
message

FATHER ORTIZ
Please Dr Marshall
(gesturing to the chair
opposite Bernadette)
Sit down

DR MARSHALL
Is that so Bernadette Do you have
a message you want to share

BERNADETTE
Yes I do Our lady told me about
you Dr Marshall

DR MARSHALL
Did she

( )
92

BERNADETTE
She told me one would come along
that could help Who needed to hear
the message And that one is you

DR MARSHALL
Well I’m all ears

BERNADETTE
When I first saw the Blessed
Mother she did not look the way I
had always imagined her She was
riding a lion and she carried a
bow and quiver and a sword

DR MARSHALL

Ishtar

BERNADETTE
Was that her name I did not know
her name

DR MARSHALL
Ishtar the great Mother Goddess of
the ancient Babylonians invoked
for battles

BERNADETTE
Yes Our Lady was dressed for
battle for indeed a battle awaits
A few nights later she appeared
again to me in my dreams Only this
time she rode a tiger she had
eight armsIn each hand she
carried a weapon

DR MARSHALL
DurgaThe Mother Goddess of the
Hindus The desroyer of demons

BERNADETTE
Precisely

DR MARSHALL
Then you didn’t have a vision of
the Virgin Mary You had visions of
ancient goddesses

BERNADETTE

But what is it that you teach about
the sacred female Dr Marshall

( )
93

DR MARSHALL
That ultimately they are all the
same

A chill runs through Ginny’s body She shivers

DR MARSHALL(CONT’D)
But tell meWhat was the message
that she gave you What is this
battle you say is approaching

Just then the phone ringsEveryone except for Bernadette
jumps

Mr DeSalis stands and rushes across the room into the
kitchen In a hushed voice he answers the phone

PIERRE(OS)
Mike What’s wrong with Mike

BERNADETTE
And soit begins

PIERRE(OS)
No

His wife stands now and rushes into the other room Father
Ortiz follows

Bernadette motions for Ginny to draw near

BERNADETTE
I will tell you now For you must
hear Our Lady’s message The time
is lateWe must begin

Ginny stands and moves over to to sit on the couch beside
Bernadette

DR MARSHALL
Tell me

BERNADETTE
It is the beginning of a great
battle A terrible malignant evil
has been manifesting in the world
for some time now And now one has
come who will bring great
destruction to all men and women
It is the one who is prophesied
The Antichrist is coming The one
foretold in the Book of Revelation

BERNADETTE
I am forbidden to tell you their
name for now But the Antichrist is
not a he but a she

disappears

Miles plunges back to earth dead

The woman takes Miles’s spirit away

PERRY
How do you explain the pattern of
deaths and disappearances on this
campus every twenty years

DEAN GREGORY
I can’t Can you After all you’re
the law

PERRY
I just find it a very odd
coincidence

DEAN GREGORY
Well so do I That such a small
seemingly tranquil town should
harbor a killer

( )

PERRY
Don’t blame the town

DEAN GREGORY
Well surely you’re not blaming the
college After all we’ve been the
victims here I should be barging
into your office and accusing you

PERRY
Is that what you think I’m doing
accusing you

DEAN GREGORY
Well I should hardly think for
what These killings date back over
a hundred years

PERRY
And it’s not published in any of
your literature

DEAN GREGORY
Would you publicize such a thing
Deputy

PERRY
WellI think the community has the
right to know the full details

DEAN GREGORY
Are you saying you’re going to the
press

PERRY
I think that might be wise If
anyone knows anything they can
come forward

DEAN GREGORY
I wish you wouldn’t Deputy Think
of what it would do to this school

You better watch yourself Deputy

INT BENTLEY HALL BASEMENT- CLOSET - NIGHT

Tish hears the familiar creak on the stairs The key is in
the lock

She waits but not for long

The iron door swings open and the red-hooded figure comes
inside

TISH(VO)
Is it her Is it Oostie If it is
someone else stronger I’m not sure
if I’d have much of a chance

MRS OOSTERHOUSE
Think we’d forgotten about you

TISH(VO)
It’s Oostie

Oostie places a plastic tray in front of Tish holding a
piece of crusty bread and a glass of water

MRS OOSTERHOUSE
Here slut Don’t die quite yet
We’ve come up with another plan for
you

Tish devours the bread and gulps down the water
Oostie lifts the pail now overflowing with Tish’s waste

MRS OOSTERHOUSE (CONTD)
Filthy slut

She passes Tish and closes the door

TISH(VO)

Oh my God this might have been my
last mealSo there’d be no need
to return the pailAnd no chance
for me to fight back

The door creaks open again Oostie sets the pail down and
turns once more to Tish

( )
102

In the split second it takes to bend down to retrieve the
empty tray Tish leaps She grabs the pail and swinging out
with it whacks Oostie in the head

Stunned Oostie staggers against the wall giving Tish just
enough time to unclasp the handle and plunge it deep in her
gut

Oostie lets out a BLOODCURDLING HOWL of pain
With great effort Tish grips the handle and cuts upward

MRS OOSTERHOUSE
Youslut

Blood covers Tish’s hand

TISH
Why was I kidnapped Why did you
kill Joelle

MRS OOSTERHOUSE
HELP ME

She slides down the wall where Tish had attacked her

TISH
I swear to God I’1ll rip out your
guts Tell me what’s going on in
this house Tell me how to get out

MRS OOSTERHOUSE
You can’t escape

TISH
You were planning to drink my
blood you freak Just like you
drank Joelle’s

MRS OOSTERHOUSE
Not your’s Not after I confirmed
the stories about you were true
You’re no virgin Your blood is no
good to us

With a sudden merciless yank Tish pulls the handle out of
Oostie’s belly causing a terrible popping sound

She falls hard to the floor on her fat ass
TISH
But you were going to kill me You

and Dean Gregory And who else Is
the whole administration involved

( )
103

MRS OOSTERHOUSE
You can’t escapeHelp Somebody
help

TISH
I’1l put an end to that

With one well-aimed swipe she cuts Oosties throat Blood
squirts out like an opened fire hydrant

Oostie’s mouth moves a few more times but nothing comes
out Then her head sinks down on her chest

Holding tight to the handle Tish steps out of her cell

INT BENTLEY HALL BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS
-She is in a basement

There is old furniture covered with drop cloths Metal file
cabinets rust against a far wall The small windows that are
set high in the walls are papered over with cardboard

Tish finds the stairs

She begins to climb the sharp pail handle out in front of
her

INT SENANDAGA HOSPITAL - DAY

Billy and Sue enter the hospital where Mike and Heidi have
been taken

It isn’t much of a hospital by any stretch of the
imagination There is a wing with rooms for patients and an
emergency room

Sue’s eyes squint as they enter the flourescent lights
blinding her

BILLY
I’m sure Mike is okay You can just
wait for me in the lobby if you
like

SUE
(giving him a kiss)
Okay

Billy heads off down the hallway Sue puts a dollar in the

soda machine hits the button and dispenses a can of Diet
Coke

( )
104

Sue pops the lid off her soda finds a seat opposite an old
man who appears to be asleep and pulls a battered magazine
across her lap and begins to read

Moments later her eyes lift up almost magically from her
magazine

The old man is gone and a girl with thick dark hair wearing
a white blouse over a pair of jeans and holding rosary beads
in her lap is now sitting opposite her

BERNADETTE

Hello
SUE

Hello
BERNADETTE

Are you Sue
SUE

Yes Yes I am And you are
BERNADETTE

Bernadette DeSalis Mike’s sister
SUE

Oh Billy must have told you I was

SUE
How is your brother doing

BERNADETTE
He’s going to be fine

SUE
Well that’s great What does the
doctor say
BERNADETTE
Oh nothing But I know Mike’s going
to be fine
Sue studies Bernadette apprehensively for a moment

SUE(VO)
Get away from her Now

( )
105

BERNADETTE
It seems odd doesn’t it

SUE
I’m sorry what seems odd

BERNADETTE
That not long ago it was I who
languished in the hospital and
Mike came to see me And now it’s
the other way around

SUE(VO)
She read my mind

BERNADETTE
But Mike’s going to be fine I just
wanted you to know that

SUE
I’mI’m glad

Bernadette laughs

BERNADETTE
I know you were there when he
collapsed so I know you must be
particularly worried about him But
I can assure you Sue Mike will be
fine And so will Heidi Swettenham

SUE(VO)
Get away from her now

Sue stands knocking her magazine from her lap to the floor

SUE
I’mI’m going to get some air

BERNADETTE
(extending her hand)
It was nice to meet you Sue

SUE(VO)
Don’t take her hand But that’s
rude Billy would be furious if he
learned I snubbed his best friend’s
sister
Sue reaches over her fingers touch Bernadette’s

Time seems to stop

( )
106
Sue can hear her own breathing just before everything goes
dark

She opens her mouth to scream but no sound comes out

The whole room vanishes in blacknessbut Sue still sees
Bernadette’s face

Bernadette’s eyes are closed her mouth slightly open and
there is a humming sound coming from her throat

A light seems to surround Bernadette’s head

The girl’s long hair begins to rise into the air as the
light intensifies

SUE(VO)
You won’t win I’m stronger than
you are

And then her hand disengages from Bernadette’s and the room
returns to normal

Sue staggers her knees buckling She sits down hard on the
floor

Bernadette gets up from her chair and approaches Sue
Sue forces herself to look over at the girl

Bernadette’s eyes are closed as she kneels beside Sue Her
lips are moving

Sue tries to get to her feet but cannot She sinks again to
the floor She looks at Bernadette in amazement

SUE(VO)

She’s praying She’s praying over
me

A NURSE’S AID young Afro-American rushes over and helps
Sue up

NURSE’S AID
Are you okay

SUE
I’m fine just help me up I must
have fainted

Sue manages to get up and with the help of the nurse’s aid
sits back down on the couch

Bernadette sits beside her

( )
107

SUE
What did you do to me

BERNADETTE
I didn’t do anything

Sue does not say anything she just stares straight ahead

BERNADETTE (CONT ’D)
It’s not your fault you know

SUE
What are you talking about

BERNADETTE
Youyou really don’t know do you
(shaking her head)
No you don’t It doesn’t make any
sense to me

Bernadette cocks her head as if she is listening to someone
She nods

BERNADETTE (CONT ’D)
That makes it even more wrong Yes
you’re right I do understand I
will pray for her

SUE(VO)
She’s insane She’s listening to
voices no one else can hear

BERNADETTE
You don’t have to be afraid of me
Sue Maybe I can even help you

SUE

I don’t need any help
(standing)

I’m going out to the car to wait

white cloud her blue eyes shining brightly

dean’s house I managed to break

part of it too

SUE
Oostie Harmless little Oostie

TISH

Tish laughs wildly

TISH(CONT’D)
But I got out And we’ll get them

SUE

Sue picks up the phone on her desk

TISH

glowing crimson red

SUE

Dean Gregory in a green smoking jacket enters
three leather-clad guards

DEAN GREGORY

Tish turns on Sue eyes wide

TISH

DEAN GREGORY
Indeed

Tish screams again as the guards take her out of the room
TISH

No
INT DEAN GREGORY’S RESIDENCE - NIGHT
Tish wakes finally She is hanging upside down on a cross
She tries to scream but her mouth is gagged She is naked
A fire blazes in front of her Figures in red robes move
about in the dark room illuminated now and then by the
fire’s glow
They are chanting

Tish struggles but she is securely tied with strong rope

DEAN GREGORY
Master Master for you

Dean Gregory lets his robe fall open He is naked
Tish begins to cry

Gregory approaches her The group is chanting urging him
on

Tish closes her eyes

She never opens them as the dean rapes her

The darkness in the room seems to vibrate pulse with life
The darkness becomes the demon itself and it swallows what
is left of Tish’s body

INT ROOM 227 - DAY

Outside Sue’s dorm room window the sky looks like snow

She glances over at Malika studious as ever her nose ina

MALIKA
They’11l stop you at the gate

SUE

cap down over my forehead and he
thinks I’m a driver for one of the
big shots

MALIKA
Going to see Billy aren’t you

SUE
YeahI’ve haven’t seen him since
the other day at the hospital I
think he thinks I’m crazy

MALIKA
Well can you blame him The way
you said you were acting That boy

even agreed to see you again

SUE
I’ve got to see him Malika I’ve
got to explain what’s going
onWhat’s happening to me I just
hope he understands Promise me you
won’t squeal

MALIKA
What the hell are you talking
about What’s happening to you
I’‘ll have to admit you’ve been
acting a little cranky the last
couple of days I thought it was
just that time of the month or some
shit

SUE
I can’t explain right now Malika
Just promise me you won’t squeal
Or you haven’t seen how cranky I
can be

MALIKA
Damn Sue you’re scaring the hell
out of me

Sue gives a devilish look with an odd twinkle in her eyes

She leaves the dorm room Malika sits with a look of
confound amazement on her face
INT YELLOW BIRD CAFE - DAY

Sue sits patiently in a corner booth nursing a cup of
coffee

She doesn’t notice an older Hispanic man standing next to
the booth

FATHER ORTIZ
Do you mind if I join you

Sue looks up surprised expecting to see Billy

SUE
(shrugging)
Be my guest

FATHER ORTIZ
I’m Father Ortiz

He smiles at Sue opening his coat shrugging it off his
shoulders revealing his priestly collar

SUE
You’re a priest

FATHER ORTIZ
I am

SUE
Catholic

FATHER ORTIZ
Right again

Sue gives him a strange look

FATHER ORTIZ (CONT’D)
I just wanted a minute of your
time Miss Barlow

SUE
How do you know my name My
boyfriend will be here ina
minute

FATHER ORTIZ
This won’t take long I understand
you had a rather interesting
encounter with a friend of mine
recently at the hospital

( )

SUE
I don’t know what you’re talking
about

FATHER ORTIZ
You seem sad Is everything all
right

SUE
I don’t know you

FATHER ORTIZ
But I know you Miss Barlow I know
you must be very confused right
now even frightened

SUE
Why would I be frightened

FATHER ORTIZ
It’s not hopeless you know It
doesn’t have to go the way they are
expecting You still have your own
self-will You still have a soul

SUE
Okay now I’m thinking you’re
crazy Who are they I should
call the waitress and have her kick
you out

FATHER ORTIZ
I suspect you are not usually so
belligerent Does it frighten you
Concern you

SUE
Your friend at the hospital You
mean that freak don’t you
Bernadette DeSalis How dare she
speak of my mother

FATHER ORTIZ
It must have been hard for you to
grow up without your mother

SUE(VO)
How does he know so much about me

Sue narrows her eyes getting ready to tell him to get the
fuck out of her face

But suddenly she softens

( )
117

SUE
I wish I had known her

FATHER ORTIZ
There’s been a lot of tragedy
lately I know you don’t want any
more to occur

SUE
It’s almost like the college is
under some kind of curse

FATHER ORTIZ
As though there are dark forces at
work there

Father Ortiz’s smile is still kind but his eyes narrow a
fraction and the twinkle in them seems to go out as he
speaks further

FATHER ORTIZ(CONT’D)
Tell me Sue Do you believe in
evil Evil as a force that exists
in the world

SUE
I suppose without evil good cannot
exist They need each other They
define each other

FATHER ORTIZ
Many theologians have debated and
written about this very question

SUE
Why did you sit down here with me
Did you come here specifically
looking for me

FATHER ORTIZ
I admit I did Mike DeSalis is
being sent home as we speak He has
made a full and complete recovery
I heard your boyfriend Billy say
he had to hurry back to meet you
here

SUE
And you came to tell me this

FATHER ORTIZ
I wanted to see your reaction

( )
118

SUE
I’m happy of course Mike is
Billy’s best friend

FATHER ORTIZ
Heidi Swettenham is also going
home

Sue just stares

FATHER ORTIZ (CONT’D)
Both are better because they were
cured through the intercession of
Our Lady the Blessed Virgin Mary

SUE(VO)
Billy was at the hospital to see
Heidi That’s why he’s late

FATHER ORTIZ

Only Bernadette kept the faith All
along she knew her brother would
be all right As would Heidi

(leaning close to Sue)
So there are other forces at work
too I just wanted you to know
that

SUE
Bernadette

FATHER ORTIZ
Yes Bernadette
(reaching over and placing a
hand over Sue’s
She’s quite concerned about you

SUE
(pulling her hand away)
She doesn’t know me She told lies
about my mother

Billy suddenly appears next to Sue breaking the moment

BILLY
Father Ortiz

FATHER ORTIZ
(standing up)
Hello Billy I was just keeping
your girlfriend company until you
got here I’ve already given her
the good news about Mike

his wife Oostie and other members
of the staff They are a member of
a cult devil worshipers bent on
bringing on the end of daysAs
crazy as it sounds it is centered
here at Wilbourne

Billy is speechless all he can do is stare and nod his head
as Sue continues

SUE (CONTD)
They’ve taken Malika to use in one
of their Satanic rituals

Sue sits silent for a few moments thinking of the right
words to say

Sue grabs

SUE (CONTD)
But here comes the really
terrifying part They’ve been
waiting a hundred years for this
event which is going to happen
soon They needed an Antichrist to
finish their ceremony

Billy and holds him

SUE (CONTD)
I’m the Antichristthey’ve been
waiting for Billy My mother was
the one raped in the room on the
third floor by the Demon I am the
daughter of the devil Billy I’1ll
sit at my father’s side at the
final ceremony They’1l come for

take off his shirt

SUE

virgin I’1ll be no good to them

Billy pushes Sue away

trust My mother said to go and see
Dr Marshall She’s the only one
here we can trust

INT DR MARSHALL’S APARTMENT NIGHT

Billy and Sue enter Ginny’s apartment out of breath from
their journey and immediately begin to tell her about their
ordeal

SUE
Dr Marshall Dr MarshallWe
need

Ginny puts her finger to her lips to silence Sue and Billys
ranting

DR MARSHALL
Calm down childrenWe’ve been
expecting you

SUE
We

There is a dark haired lady with piercing blue eyes sitting
silently on the couch that Sue suddenly recognizes

DR MARSHALL
Id like you to meet someone

The lady stands and approaches Sue

( )

SUE
Mother

Tears flow from both of their eyes as they embrace

MARICLARE
Hello Susan

SUE
They told me you were deadBut
that girl Bernadette said you
were aliveYou appeared ina
dream to meI knew then what the
girl said was true

They release their embrace and Mariclare stands back and
takes a better look at Sue

MARICLARE
What a pretty girl you are

Her smile hardens somewhat as she continues to look at Sue

MARICLARE (CONT’D)
Was it terribly hard for you

SUE
That’s putting it mildly I can’t
believe all the lies they told me

MARICLARE
They kept you away from me all
these yearsI guess they didn’t
want you to know your mother was a
lunaticand they sent you to
Wilbourne

Sue nods

MARICLARE (CONT’D)
Mother called yesterday and asked
me not to tell you the truth But
they can’t tell me what to do
anymore And then Dr Marshall came
and rescued meshe brought me
hereI knew you would come

SUE
Did they know what would happen to
you at Wilbourne

( )
129

MARICLARE
Do you mean did they know I’d be
the one The one whod be raped

Sue nods again

MARICLARE (CONT’D)
I think he did My father At
least I think he was hoping Id be
the oneIt was a great honor you
know

Sue is speechless

MARICLARE (CONT’D)
I didn’t know anything I was just
like you dear Susan Just a naive
sheep being led to slaughter

SUE
But now you know You understand
what happened to you

MARICLARE
YesWhen you’ve been fucked by a
demon you get a few things in
return You can see things
Understand things So much suddenly
made sense Those other girls who
went missing or were killed at
Wilbourne were a part of the
bargain Virgin blood to keep the
dark forces sustained Keep them
interested Because to bring about
the Rapture

SUE
You mean the end times The
prophecy of Revelation

MARICLARE
That’s right To bring about the
end times they needed an
Antichrist And Revelation says it
will be a girl eighteen years of
age and her name will be Susan

SUE

It doesn’t say that I’ve read
Revelation

( )
130

MARICLARE
But not the lost books of
Revelation The ones the Vatican
tried to hide for centuries A
renegade priest smuggled them out
formed his own little cult headed
up by a good little Satanist named
Sarah Wilbourne I actually got to
read them

SUE
But motherThere’s got to be a
way we can beat them That girl
told me there was still hope She’s
seen the Virgin Mary

MARICLARE
This goes far deeper than just God
and Satan Susan This is much more
elemental This is about the power
of good and the power of evil It
transcends all religion

SUE
But what can I do

MARICLARE
(shaking her head)
They’ve been planning this for a
long time It goes back over a
hundred years And now finally is
the time

SUE
Because of me

MARICLARE
But it’s not too late You don’t
have to fulfill the prophecies

There is a sudden knock at the door Dr Marshall answers to
find Joyce Davenport waiting She pushes past Dr Marshall
and enters the room abruptly

Billy who is sitting on the couch pretty much in a trance
during the whole conversation suddenly jumps up when Joyce
pushes her way into the room

DR MARSHALL

What in the hell do you think
you’re doing

( )
131

JOYCE DAVENPORT
Oh calm down Ginny I’m just here
for Susan I knew she would be
here I saw her car outside Come
on Sue you have a date with
destiny

Mariclare still sits calmly on the couch Joyce finally
realizes she is there

JOYCE DAVENPORT (CONT’D)
What in the hell are you doing out
of the nuthouse Mariclare You
poor delusional soulHave you
been boring these good people with
your stories of being raped by
Satan and the Antichrist

MARICLARE
You betrayed me left the room
that night knowing what was to
occur You’d already made your deal
with the people running the school
Success and fame that’s what you
wanted

JOYCE
I knew nothing of the sort I made
no deal with the people at the
school See how she’s still telling
these same lies after all these

years
SUE
I want no part of it I’m not going
with you
JOYCE

So youll end up like your mother
Is that what you want Do you think
wed just let you waltz off to do
your own thing Do you think your
father would just let you go

Sue doesn’t reply she just stands trembling She trembles
in a rage that is welling up inside her

JOYCE (CONTD)
You’1l end up in some lunatic
asylum like your mother has been
for all these years

( )
132

SUE
You put her there You could have
stopped what happened to her

JOYCE
It’s your choice Sue Crazy
lunatic asylumor untold power
and glory You decide

Joyce looks over at Billy who is now seated back on the
couch

JOYCE (CONTD)
You’ve never been like other girls
You’ve never been sick You can do
things with your mind You can’t
ever live the life of a normal
girl And you can’t love can you
(pointing over at Billy)
And the one boy who might have
loved you is now terrified of you
aren’t you son

Billy jumps from the couch and embraces Sue and shakes his
head

BILLY
That’s where you’re wrong Ms
Davenport I love Sue She’s not
going anywhere with you

JOYCE
That’s very noble son but her
choice is clear There is nothing
else for her Her destiny

In an instant Sue is transformed She seems almost to
explodeIn her place stands a fearful creature a swirling
crackling demon whose form is indistinctas if darkness is
suddenly given life

Joyce jumps back terrified Billy as well

SUE
I WILL GO WITH YOU BUT REMEMBER
WHO I AM I WILL NOT BE TOLD WHAT
TO DO I WILL GIVE INSTRUCTIONS
AND YOU MISERABLE SCUM WILL FOLLOW
THEM IS THAT CLEAR

JOYCE
Yes

And then Sue is back looking none worse for the wear

( )
133

DR MARSHALL
Sue You mustn’t give in

BILLY
Don’t go with her Sue We can beat
them

MARICLARE
Let her goShe must do what she
must do

SUE

It is my destiny

Sue leaves with Joyce a hard cruel look on her face

EXT CEMETERY OUTSIDE WALLS OF WILBOURNE COLLEGE - NIGHT

Billy sighs and exhales Even in the darkness he can see his
frosty breath in front of his face

He talks to Bernadette on his cell

BILLY
Why should I do what you ask

BERNADETTE (0OS)
You should do it because you love
her

BILLY
Do I She’s not human

BERNADETTE (0S)
Oh Billy of course she is She’s
as human as you or I But she’s
in trouble I know that Bad
trouble

Billy looks over the Wilbourne wall He can see the back
windows of Dean Gregory’s house

BERNADETTE(0OS) (CONTD)
Sue can be saved and you can save
her Billy

Billy pulls his woolen cap down further over his ears and

looks again over the wall at the top two floors of the
dean’s house an imposing gray granite building

( )
134

BILLY
You keep saying not to tell my
mother You make it seem as if
she’s a part of the conspiracy
whatever it is

BERNADETTE (0S)
Trust no one Billy

BILLY
Even you

BERNADETTE (0S)
But you do trust me

BILLY
I don’t know why You’re just my
best friend’s kid sister But yeah
I do trust you Bernie

He kneels down behind a tree trying to take shelter from
the wind

BERNADETTE (0S)
Sue’s in there

BILLY
I need to take a better look I’11
call you back

In a sudden move he begins climbing the bare branches of
the tree Now he is able to make out faces in the lighted
windows

BILLY
There’s Dean Gregory And the
state cop who’s been asking lots of
questions around town about Bonnie
Warner AndgoddamnJoyce
Davenport
The sound of tires on gravel distracts Billy’s attention

He peers through the branches to see a car pulling into the
long circular driveway around the dean’s house

It is his mother’s Toyota

He watches too stunned to move as his mother gets out of
the car and saunters up to the front door

She is let inside

( )
135

In moments he can see her through the window being handed
a glass of wine by Joyce Davenport

BILLY
Oh my God She’s a part of
thisWhatever this is

As he watches another car pulls into the driveway
He pulls his cell out of his coat pocket and dials

BILLY

INT PERRY HOLLAND’S RESIDENCE - NIGHT
Perry peers out from between his blinds

The wind is blowing hard and the night sky is covered in
gray clouds

It begins to snow at first lightly then much harder

He glances in the mirrorHis hair is matted down greasy
and unwashed

His eyes are shadowed with dark circles

PERRY (VO)
Damn I look a wreck But what the
hellI haven’t been going into
the sheriffs office these days so
what difference does it make All I
have to do is stay in this
apartment with the doors locked and
the blinds drawnThere are things
out thereThings that scare the
hell out of me

There is a sudden banging sound behind him He whirls around
to find nothing

PERRY (VO) (CONT’D)
Damn I’m totally losing
itBernadette told me I was right
in my suspicions She’s seen the
Virgin Mary She knowsShe knows
the truth

There is another sound a rapping sound

Perry jumps his gun strapped to waist

( )
136

The rapping continues
Someone is at the door
Every nerve in Perry’s body tingles

PERRY
They’ve come for me They’re here

He peers through the blinds on the door

He waves them in

INT PERRY HOLLAND’S CAR - CONTINUOUS
-They drive toward the dean’s house

BERNADETTE
Good work Doctor

Cars are parked all around the dean’s house many with
out-of-state plates

The house is ablaze with light from the top floor to the
basement

The snow blankets the campus in a soft whiteness that
sparkles in the moonlight

Perry parks the car and turns off the ignition

( )
142

PERRY
Now stay here until I check things
out

DR MARSHALL
OkayThere’s not much I can do
anyway I’m really not sure what
any of us can do

PERRY

They watch Perry walk up the steps to the front door
No one says a word
The only sound in the car is Bernadette’s steady murmur as
she whispers the prayers of the Rosary

Billy sits in the tree his blood boiling
BILLY

This crazy cultthis secret

ceremony that’s somehow going to

hurt SueAnd Mom’s a part of it

(beat)
Wellmaybe it’s time one more

person joined their little party

He drops from the tree branch over the fence the soft snow
cushioning his fall

Billy stands up brushes himself off and begins to search
for a way into the house

EXT DEAN GREGORY’S RESIDENCE - CONTINUOUS

Perry rings the bell of the front door of the dean’s house
The dean opens the door partially

DEAN GREGORY
Deputy Holland what’s going on

Perry keeps his face blank
PERRY

I’d just like to ask what’s going
on here tonight

( )
143

The dean smiles but does not open the door

DEAN GREGORY

friendsWhy are you asking

PERRY

DEAN GREGORY
Sue Barlow Oh you mean one of our
freshman students

EXT DEAN GREGORY’S RESIDENCE - CONTINUOUS

Billy pops open a basement window and jumps down into the
murky damp darkness
INT DEAN GREGORY’S HOUSE - BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS

Across the vast expanse of the basement Billy spots a dim
orange light

Carefully he approaches feeling his way
He stumbles over something metal causing a loud CLANG

Billy stands still for a moment but no one is alerted of
his intrusion

There is loud music and laughter coming from upstairs
He resumes his walk across the basement

He reaches the light that is coming from under a door He
tries the knob but the door is locked

Billy bends down and peers through the keyhole
He gasps from what he sees

Above him he hears footstepscoming downstairs

INT PERRY HOLLAND’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

Dr Marshall and the others wait patiently in Perry’s police
car but her patience is running thin

DR MARSHALL
Where is he He’s been in there
over twenty minutes

FATHER ORTIZ
Let us not worry needlessly
Remember Perry has a gun

DR MARSHALL
Guns are hardly a match against
what we’re facing

BERNADETTE
They haven’t summoned the demon
yet But Perry is indeed in
trouble We’re going to have to
save him

DR MARSHALL
(turning to look at
Bernadette)
Are you sure

( )
145

BERNADETTE
(nodding)
And it’s going to have to be you
Dr Marshall That’s what Our Lady
is telling me

DR MARSHALL
What is it that I have to do

BERNADETTE
You have to go inside You have to
get to Sue

INT DEAN GREGORY’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Sue and her party proceed down the stairs in a procession
each of them having donned their red robes each carrying a
candle

To the great ceremony room in the BASEMENT

An orange glow permeates everything changing the colors of
their faces to the hues of hell

Folding chairs are arranged in rows and in front as if on
stage a huge black canvas covers a structure whole shape is
difficult to determine

Sue is led up to the front where she contemplates the
canvas for a moment before turning back to look out over the
crowd taking it’s seats

She sees deputies and state policemen that she recognizes
She also sees her grandfather’s colleagues faculty members
and even a couple of students she’d seen in the
cafeteriaAnd Billy’s mother

SUE
(whispers to herself)
Billy

JOYCE
(slipping her cowl down from
around he face)
Have a seat Sue
They sit next to each other on the dais in front
DEAN GREGORY
(quietly holding up a finger)
Joyce we’re about to begin

She shrugs and pulls her hood back around her head

( )
146

Sue feels nothing No fear No anxiety She shows no
excitement for what is about to happen

SUE(VO)
All my life I’ve wanted to meet my
father And now here I am about to
come face to face with him And I
feelnothing

Dean Gregory stands before the group intoned

DEAN GREGORY
My friendstonight is the result
of all our plans all of our hard
work Tonight is the beginning of a
new more glorious phase in our
religion Tonight we begin to reap
the benefits of those who came
before us Many have worked their
entire lives for this day to come
to fruition and as our founder
the great Sarah Wilbourne planned
it has now come to pass The day we
have all longed for the day when
the world becomes ours

Sue looks over at Joyce who winks at her from inside her
cowl as Dean Gregory continues

DEAN GREGORY (CONT’D)
Tonight we sacrifice once more to
our great master to bring him
forth amongst us

SUE(VO)
Sacrifice

Sue turns her face back to the canvas behind the dean

Gregory nods and two of his security men yank on a couple
of chords

The canvas falls exposing a huge cross made out of black
wood

And bound to the cross is Malika

Sue studies the unconscious form of her roommate She is
naked and her head is dropped down to her chest

Emotionless Sue turns back to look at the crowd again

The chanting begins

( )
147

Sue smiles
SUE(VO)
Maybe it will be exciting I never
thought I’d witness a demon devour
a human being
Sue begins to laugh
JOYCE
You see I told you all this could
be a lot of fun
The chanting intensifies

Everyone is caught up in the ritual most with eyes closed

Sue notices two security men walking down the center aisle
forcing along a hooded man in between them

When they reach the cross where Malika is strapped they
force the man down on his knees pulling off his hood

It is Deputy Perry Holland

His hands are handcuffed behind his back He seems to be
drugged and sways on his knees

Dean Gregory steps forward and pulls a switch at the side of
the dais

The great cross begins to move Wood and gears creaking it
turns taking Malika with it until it comes to rest
completely inverted

An upside down cross Malika’s head now nearly touches the
floor

The chanting stops
DEAN GREGORY
For you master We bring you two
tonight They are yours

Perry continues to sway on his knees

Malika is beginning to wake up
INT PERRY HOLLAND’S CAR - CONTINUUS

Father Ortiz and Bernadette are still waiting in Perry’s
police car

Bernadette’s cell phone buzzes furiously
Father Ortiz picks it up

FATHER ORTIZ

tied to a cross And they’ve got

Bernadette is lost in prayer in the back seat

BILLY(OS)

FATHER ORTIZ
Dr Marshall has gone inside
Bernadette says she is the key She
will be able to get to Sue

BERNADETTE
Give me the phone

Father Ortiz looks over the backseat
Bernadette is no longer praying her hand is held out
BERNADETTE
(to Billy)
Dr Marshall is indeed the key but
you have a part to play You’1ll
know when it’s time to act

She switches off the phone

( )
149

BERNADETTE
Now Father it’s time we do our
part as well

FATHER ORTIZ
What’s that

She opens her car door and motions for him to do the same
with his
EXT DEAN GREGORY’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

--He follows her as she trudges through the snow to a spot
right in front of the house

She drops to her knees nearly hip deep in snow and begins
to pray

Father Ortiz does the same

INT DEAN GREGORY’S HOUSE - BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS

One by one the candles are snuffed out and the room falls
into darkness

Only the two torches on either side of the dais ramain
illuminated

The cross on which Malika is strapped turns again clicking
back into its upright position

Malika is now fully awake and she begins to scream
The pressure in the room grows fierce
Then the RUMBLE comes up from beneath the floor
JOYCE
(grabbing Sue’s hand)
He’s coming
SUE
My father
EXT DEAN GREGORY’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

The front door to Dr Marshall’s great surprise is open

She stops for a moment to say a prayer

DR MARSHALL
Holy Motheryou of the sacred
femininewalk with me
INT DEAN GREGORY’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
Dr Marshall hurries through the dean’s foyer
She can hear a low steady rumbling sound from down below
She locates the door to the basement

It is dark down there and she shivers from the sudden cold
wind that blows through the stairway

Dr Marshall takes a deep breath and heads toward the door
As she does she passes a large gilt-framed mirror

She catches her reflection and behind hera woman in blue
carrying a sword

She spins around
There is no one there

She starts down the stairs

INT DEAN GREGORY’S HOUSE - BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS

Billy feels the house begin to shake he shudderswith a
terror he has never felt in his young life

Hell is eruptingHe feels the concrete moving beneath his
feet
EXT DEAN GREGORY’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
Father Ortiz and Bernadette continue to pray
FATHER ORTIZ
Lord Jesus I beseech you Save
this house and the people within

from the demon’s clutches

Bernadette kneels serenely in the snow mumbling her
prayers

Father Ortiz trembles terrified

He feels the earthquake now through the blanket of snow

( )
151

The moon is gone

The power is out across the campus everything is plunged
into darkness a darkness that takes life around him

The darkness begins to close around Father Ortiz’s throat

FATHER ORTIZ
No

BERNADETTE
PRAY FATHER PRAY

But it is too lateThe darkness has him by the throat

The darkness seems to grow limbs and lifts him high in the
air Higher and higher

And then just like Miles Holland it drops him head first
into the snow

Bernadette does not move as the snow around her turns red
from the priest’s blood

She continues to pray

From the house comes a great roarThe roar of a lion

INT DEAN GREGORY’S HOUSE - BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS

A figure both enormous and small at the same time moves
down the center isle toward Sue red eyes glowing in the
dark

SUE(VO)
We have the same eyes

Darkness rolls down the center islea deep pulsating
darkness encasing a beating black heart

Sue shivers from the damp coldness as it grows near
Behind her Malika screams again

On either side people fall from their chairs Some drop to
their knees

Metal chairs CLANG

Cries and gasps disturb the silence as the breathing
darkness passes down the center isle

The DEMON seems to smile amidst the chaos

( )
152

It continues to approach Sue on the dais

DEMON (V0O)
(in words only Sue could hear
)
Daughter
SUE(VO)
Father

The darkness reaches out for her
Sue puts out her hand to meet it

DEMON
Sue

Everyone spins around to look

Sue withdraws her hand and the demon whirls around ina
great rush of darkness it’s red eyes growing large

Then it is gone

At the bottom of the stairs looking into the room is Dr
Marshall

DR MARSHALL
Sue It’s not too late You can
stop this You know you can

DEAN GREGORY
(to his guards)
Get her

Sue’s vision goes red there is a high-pitched thrumming in
her ears

SUE(VO)
My fatherHe’s gone

Anger begins to well up inside her she stands eyes
blazing

(just as the guards set upon
her )
Sue You are your mother’s daughter
as much as you are his

INT DR MARSHALL’S APARTMENT - AT THE SAME TIME

Mariclare is on her knees in her room praying eyes tightly
shut She crosses herself head down shaking from the fear
of the ceremony that is going on

MARICLARE

Lord please give Sue the strength

to stand up against the demon May

she make the right choice and save

us from the darkness Give her

strength oh Lord
The lights in her room blink on and off the floor begins to
rumble She feels the darkness approach across the miles as
if she is there
She screams

MARICLARE
Sue
INT DEAN GREGORY’S HOUSE - BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS
Sue spins around Her eyes meet Malika’s on the cross

With a wave of her hand she causes the straps that hold
Malika to fall away

The girl slumps to the ground
Sue spins on Dean Gregory who is running toward her

Her arm flies out and without even touching him she sends
him staggering backward propelled into the wall

People are standing now many trying to flee

With another wave of her hand Sue causes the door to the
stairway to slam shut locked

Sue feels the power rising up in her
SUE
They will all die all of themIn
honor of me
JOYCE

Sue Control yourself We’1ll take
care of Virginia Marshall

( )
154

SUE
No Joyce for all your
treacheryI’1l take care of you
With a grand sweep of her hand she sends Joyce flying
across the room arms outspread coming to rest on the cross
that Malika had just vacated
The straps reassemble themselves securing Joyce in place

She screams as the cross clicks into gear and inverts itself
again leaving her upside down

On the dais Sue laughs maniacally

She points at people in the crowd feeling the power surge
down her arm and through her fingers

She kills a state cop then her biology teacher
Sue laughs uproariously
The whole room is screaming in panic
Sue’s eyes come to rest on her GRANDFATHER
SUE
You made me like thisYou made me
a creature that would be born
without the capablity to love or be

loved

GRANDFATHER
SusanYou will be great

SUE
I am great

With a flick of her hand she blows her grandfather’s head
off Her grandmother screams as the old man’s blood covers
her

Amid the pandemonium she hears a new voice She spins in
it’s direction

Billy is standing in front of a door he had just broke
down

BILLY
Sue you’re wrongI love you

They stare into each other’s eyes

BILLY (CONT’D)
I love you Sue

Dean Gregory is getting to his feet

Dr Marshall struggles with the guards who hold her she
watches the dean waver across the room heading for Sue

DR MARSHALL
Holy Mother Save your daughter
Sue is as much your daughter as
his

In that instant the two great torches on either side of the
dais fall bursting into a huge fire that separates Gregory
from Sue and Billy

In moments the whole room is on fire

From nowhere Gayle appears grabbing Billy’s arm

GAYLE
We’ve got to get out of here

Billy and Sue keep their eyes locked on each other

BILLY
I do love you Sue And I thinkI
think you started to love me

SUE
YesYes I did

Sue starts to cry

The door sealing off the room from the stairs flings open
and people begin scrambling to get away from the flames

People are trampling over each other as they attempt to get
up the stairs just as the fire catches hold of the walls

SUE
(to Billy)
Go Take your mother and save
yourself

( )
156
Their eyes continue to hold for a moment Gayle is crying
hysterically tugging at Billy’s sleeve

BILLY
Sue

SUE
Go

Sue watches them go the intense heat of the flames now
reaching her face

She turns and helps a sobbing Malika to her feet removing
her robe and placing it around Malika’s naked body

SUE
You will be strong now Malika
Your legs will carry you You will
go upstairs and save yourself

MALIKA
Sue you must come too

SUE
NoMy place is here

She reaches down and also brings Perry Holland to his feet
SUE (CONT ’D)
You too Deputy You will find

your legs strong enough

Perry glances at Sue for a moment His handcuffs suddenly
open freeing his hands from behind his back

He grips Malika’s arm and together they make their way out
of the burning room

Flames are now jumping across the ceiling
Sue looks down at Joyce Davenport upside down on the cross
SUE (CONTD)

Yes you were right Joyce All of

this can be so much fun
Joyce screams
Upstairs as smoke billows up from the cellar and sounds of
sirens can be heard in the distance Dr Marshall makes her
way among the screaming throng of people toward the front

door

A hand reaches out and grabs her by the arm

157

DEAN GREGORY
Not so fast Dr Marshall

She spins around and comes face-to-face with Dean Gregory
his head is bleeding and covered with soot

He pokes a gun in her ribs and whispers

DEAN GREGORY
I should have fired you long ago

Dr Marshall tenses for a shot
But instead
A sword suddenly plunges through Gregory from behind

Dr Marsahll sees it’s blade emerge from his chest and then
the blood streams down the front of his shirt

His eyes register surprise then horror then nothing
He crumples to the floor

Dr Marshall looks aroundThe sword is gone

The Woman who had wielded it is nowhere in sight

As the flames begin popping up through the carpet Ginny
hurries outside into the snowy night

EXT DEAN GREGORY’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

The fire engines arrive but they are too late the dean’s
house is completely engulfed in flames

house is nothing more than a smoldering ruin
