The Child is the Father of the Man
- William Wordsworth

the theory of black holes was developed before there was
any indication from observations that they actually existed
I do not know of any other example in science where such a
great extrapolation was successfully made solely on the basis
of thought It shows the remarkable power and depth of
Einsteins theory There is still much we dont know such
as what happens to objects and information that fall into a
black hole Do the reemerge elsewhere in the Universe or in
another universe And can we warp space and time so much
that one can travel back in time Maybe someone will come
back from the future and tell us

- Stephen Hawking

Up aheadat the BASE OF THE BRIDGE

There are TWO WORK CREWS several hundred feet apart

THE FIRST CREW is CON ED A corrugated vacuum tube feeds

LIFT loaded with LUMBER fails to negotiate a turnwhacks
into an abutment spilling its load onto the roadway

Bad timing because right now that Esso OIL TRUCK hits the

He does his best Slams the brakes spins the wheel hits
the horn but it doesnt matter 18 wheels skid across the

Firemen wedge sandbags between the hull of the truck and the

Butch knows what hes thinking But its too late Frank is
goneslogging through the oozing oil to the hull of the

using a flashlight to peer into the darkness below Sparks
from the loose cables spit off flashes of light as the cables
hiss and slap against the ceiling and walls of the vault

on the door a faint response He goes to work on it with
the halaghan tool Gibson arrivespretty rattled Frank
gives him a wink and a smile Its gonna be okay

BUTCH
(via walkie)
Frank where are you

Frank digs down suddenly the DOOR GIVES WAY

Oil and water rush from the VAULT pouring over Frank and
Gibson foaming into the tunnel But the door is mounted
three feet off the ground There is still three feet of oil
and water trapped inside And the smell of gas is now
overwhelming

FRANK
(into walkie)
Were in Butch

Frank probes the dark vault with the FLASHLIGHT BLADE
Through smoke we see TWO MEN huddled in the corner trapped
by three loose HOT CABLES - WHIPPING AROUND THE TINY VAULT
LIKE AN ELECTRIC HYDRA Con Ed Worker 2 shivers ankle
broken leaning on older Con Ed Worker 1

FRANK (CONTD)
Time to go home fellas

Gibson sprays the room clearing out most of the smoke
Frank steps into the vault

CON ED WORKER 1
Careful If the hot end of those cables
hits you itll conduct to the water and
were all fired

Frank drops to his knees ducking under the cables shuffles
to center of the vault Places his hands at opposite ends of
the halaghan tool hoping for the cables to pass directly
over his head A hairy beat then

Frank jackknifes out of the water ramming the halaghan into
the ceiling It worked The teeth on the claw-end and the
spike on the adz-end are embedded into the concrete --
STAPLING THE CABLES TO THE CEILING Make that balls of
steel

FRANK
Go Gibby Everybody move it

Gibson and Con Ed worker 1 help injured Worker 2 out of the
vault Frank checks to make sure theyve cleared the vault
and lets go of the tool

Frank jumps into the tunnel hoists the injured worker over
his back and races back down the tunnel

Slightly frustrated he stands and opens the glass doors to
the family room where Julia is watching TV - a very young
STEPHEN HAWKING is being interviewed by WALTER CRONKITE 52

The LEGEND reads
OCTOBER 11th - FIRST GAME OF THE WORLD SERIES

Blue sky A SOFTBALL soars into view It drops down and
into a WILLIE MAYS style basket catch by Frank Sullivan

EXT LITTLE LEAGUE BASEBALL FIELD - QUEENS - DAY
The same Little League field that Frank circled on his Harley
yesterday October 10 1969 And the same field at which
John sat in the stands drinking last night October 10 1998

We are in the 9th inning of a friendly SOFTBALL GAME between
the local COPS and FIREMEN A lot of NYPD and FDNY T-shirts
sweats and caps Plenty of Mets stuff too

Having made the catch Frank coolly pulls the ball from his
mitt as he starts running toward the infield diamond
Tagging up at 3rd sorely tempted to try for home is SATCH
DELEON 30 NYPD Detective Satch feints for the plate
Frank feints the throw For a maddening gleeful moment
Frank has Satch caught between 3rd and home

In the STANDS Johnny Sullivan Marge Hersch and the FAMILIES
of the other ballplayers scream for whomever they want to win
this game of chicken

On the SIDELINES Johnny Gordo and the other KIDS serving as
BATBOYS and WATERBOYS jump around in anticipation

At HOME Butch Foster stations himself to take the throw

Suddenly Satch fakes to 3rd then bolts for home Frank
pegs it to Butch who tags the sliding Satch Game over

SATCH
Lucky throw fire boy

FRANK
(jogging in)
Luck my ass

They square off Pretending to fight Julia steps between
them And they all descend into laughter

Frank and Satch each wrap an arm around Julia and start off
Within a step Johnny slips in under Franks other arm

FRANK (CONTD)
(to Johnny)
See that kid Practice Practice

INTEXT BUTCHS HOUSE - DAY - LATER

HAMBURGERS and HOT DOGS are cooking on the BBQ

Satch sits with Johnny and Gordo and some other kids

Frank and Julia tend the BBQ Butch brings out some beers
A fun day

EXT CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAY
A DETECTIVES CAR pulls up next to a couple of BLUE and WHITES
at West 155th St The Northern tip of Manhattan Island

Across construction barricades is a half-torn down GREEK
RESTAURANT Several UNIFORMS can be seen beyond it looking

at something on the ground

As John exits the car the passenger door swings open and we
MEET a guy we havent seen in 29 YEARS - SATCHEL DELEON 59
Shaved head square jaw A ram-rod straight craggy warrior
Thirty-plus years on the force now endow him with a rare
combination of smarts guts and sense of humor

SATCH
(as they walk)
Dont choke on your pride Sull You
aint ever gonna catch another one like
that

JOHN
She made up her mind Nothin I do is
gonna change it

SATCH
Nothing youre willing to do

Spotting John and Satch a UNIFORM approaches them They
keep on walking

JOHN
Whats the story

UNIFORM
Survey crew found a body Actually a
skeleton Over here

The uniform leads John and Satch around some overgrown weeds
to SEE a patch of freshly unearthed dirtout of which
sticks a HUMAN SKULL and COLLAR BONE

In the BG a CRIME SCENE unit can be seen arriving by van

SATCH
Be real careful when pulling it out And
get the dirt around it

As Satch turns to talk to a second UNIFORM and a couple of
SURVEYORS John notices a man raking leaves in a yard not far

away As he starts to him to Satch

JOHN
I think Ill visit the neighbor

INT SHEPARD RESIDENCE - DAY - CONTINUOUS

oversees the operation

JOHN

John looks out the window
MR SHEPARD
Used to get breakfast there all the time
back from the boat Them Greeks were
good people Once that McDonalds opened
up on Dyckman they lost all their
business

John glances around the room - notes family PHOTOGRAPHS

Theres a picture of Shepard in younger days on a commercial
fishing boat Next to it a faded black and white picture of
Mrs Shepard 35 A few pictures of the Shepards and their
YOUNG SON And at the end a color photograph of the same
son about 20 in DRESS BLUES graduating from the Police

Silence Mr and Mrs Shepard stand very still John
discreetly glances at his watch

EXT CONSTRUCTION SITE - MOMENTS LATER

THUNDER in the distance CRIME SCENE personnel have made
some progress in unearthing the skeletal remains A couple
of drops of rain tap the ground and the bones

John stands looking down at the skeleton A long beat And
then he turns to Satch and they start for the car Behind
them the skeleton is carefully pulled free from the ground
WE SEE its wrists are BOUND with GLASS TAPE

He reaches the study And there beside the desk is
something that makes him stop

A PHOTOGRAPH on the wall beside the desk -- FRANK JULIA and

The picture changed John aged from 6 to 14 Julias
hairstyle and clothes changed from 60s to 70s Franks
hair receded and grayed Jon is staring at evidence of a
history that didnt exist before

John grabs the old family scrapbook he found in Franks
trunk Opens it unfolds FIREMAN KILLED CLIPPING

The main headline still reads OCTOBER 13 1969 AMAZINS

sit down at the desk when he spots something on the front

catches a glimpse of him as he glides down the hall and
enters

INT 17TH PRECINCT - INTERROGATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Frank looks up to see Shepard who quickly closes the door
behind him and unholsters his gun An eerie moment

SHEPARD
On your feet

Frank waits a beat Then very slowly he stands

SHEPARD (CONTD)
Now turn around face the wall

Frank steps back slowly turning Shepard holsters the gun
Kicks Frank up against the wall as he reaches into his pocket
and takes out the leather garrote we saw in the Peppermint
Lounge Bathroom He coils it around his hands

SHEPARD (CONTD)
How did you know

Frank is trembling

FRANK
(facing the wall)

SHEPARD
Evidence says youre the animal
(snapping garrote tight)
Thats why you hung yourself

But Frank turns

FRANK

Shepard smiles unfazed

SHEPARD
Let me draw you a picture You live at

Shepard gives Frank a look that would make a Marine Drill
Sergeant shit his pants Shepard knows Franks weakness the
one thing that would make him submit to death

Closing his eyes Frank turns to face the wallBut the door

quickly yanks Frank away from the wall shoving him ina
chair at the interrogation table

The door opens

PHIL

Franks expression begins to harden His eyes search teh
room CLOSE ON his EYES He looks like John - controlled
rage piercing through that Sullivan thousand yard stare

He stands turning around looking for something anything
that he can use to get the hell out of there

His minds racing fire fighter training kicking in And
then he looks up - just below the ceiling above the door - a
2X2 ELECTRICAL CONDUCTOR BOX

Follow Franks eyes to something else An AIR CONDITIONER
MOUNTED IN THE WINDOW

conditioners thick electrical cord - thinking He unplugs
it And then he RIPS cord out of the unit exposing wire

The bridge is being restored Barricades across the

Snags Shepards arm pulling him hard over the side

SHEPARD FALLS grabs for something anything Wraps his arms
around Franks leg hangs on tight

EXT CENTRAL PARK - LAKE - CONTINUOUS
Murky water thick with dirt and slime 5 deep

Franks hanging on to Shepards arm trying to wrestle the
gun free But Shepards using his free hand to gouge Franks
eyes Frank bites down hard on Shepards wrist

The gun sinks silently to the muddy lake bottom

But Shepard gets both hands on Franks throat Shoving his
head into the shallow water Shepards grip is like a vise
Frank futilely tries to pry Shepards fingers open

Frank is blinded by polluted water Starting to lose
consciousness Desperately he searches the muddy lake
bottom for the gun But hes getting weaker fading out

Then he feels something A BRICK fallen off the bridge
half buried in the mud Frank struggles to dig it up
Summons his last ounces of strength yanking it back and
forth its getting loose

But Shepards hands are squeezing tighter Frank finally
goes limp A few last bubbles float to the surface Shepard
smiles Catching his breath slightly loosens grip on
Franks lifeless neck

Frank springs off the lake bottom rises out of the water
like a jack-in-the-box Holding the brick with both hands
he swings CONTACT

The brick smashes against Shepards head Knocking him to
yesterday He drops like a rock

Frank waits for Shepard to come up for air Nothing

Frank crawls out of the water collapsing onto the
embankment He just lies there heart pounding chest
heaving

And suddenly Frank is startled by a MASSIVE ROAR - the sound
of eight million New Yorkers screaming in unison The Mets
have just won the World Series

Frank laughs slowly getting to his feet

his leg with his good hand

Theres something down there An ankle holster Shepard
strains to get his hand on the gun He does

In a flash Shepard has the gun to Johns temple

CLICK Shepard cocks back the hammer

SHEPARD
You were the kid I remember now

Keeping the gun pressed against Johns temple Shepard gets
to his feet

SHEPARD (CONTD)
But this time no Daddy

John closes his eyes Its over he knows hes gonna die
SILENCE Then a sound A sound weve heard before A sound
you never forget Music to our ears

CHUUT CHUUT CLICK THE SOUND OF A 12-GAUGE PUMP-ACTION
SHOTGUN RATCHETING A ROUND IN THE CHAMBER

Shepard looks up to see MAN HOLDING SHOTGUN

B-O-O-O-M SHOTGUN BLAST Buckshot ripping into Shepard
Impact lifting him off his feet He lands dead on the floor

CLOSE ON JOHNS FACE

Opening his eyes Looking up at the doorway Blinking
through shotgun smoke trying to focus Not believing what
he sees

FRANK SULLIVAN - AGE SIXTY-NINE
John looks up at his father speechless

FRANK
Im still here Chief

EXT LITTLE LEAGUE BASEBALL FIELD - MORNING - SOME YEARS
LATER

We are soaring high above a baseball diamond Clear light
air you can see for miles Float down to the field

The first taste of Spring and Softball Picnic baskets
Flowers Kites flying Children running

The bleachers filled with families and loved ones

Among them sits SAMANTHA Shes smiling shes
glowingshes pregnant PULL BACK to reveal SATCH GORDO
ELLEN and GORDY JR A dalmation puppy scampers at their feet
barking in recognition as

Frank Sullivan steps into the batters box
CLOSE ON

Pitcher 22 year-old African-Amerasian a muscular beanpole
Embroidered on the back of the his FDNY jersey is his
nickname PHIRE POWER

Quick shot of first baseman GRAHAM GIBSON - once a nervous
PROBIE now a seasoned vet And one hell of proud father

GIBSON
(to pitcher)
Take it easy on him son hes older than
Moses

Frank sneers at Gib then glances up at GIBs WIFE in the
bleachers She looks familiar its the girl Frank saved in
the warehouse 29-years ago

PHIRE POWER twirls his arm

Frank takes a big swingcontactthe ball fouls back
behind the plate Towards the parking lot Where among the
old Chevys and Fords sits a brand new MERCEDES The custom
license plate reads YAHOO

CRASH Franks foul ball comes down hard As the Mercedes
windshield spiderwebs we hear an off-camera scream

It is Gordo jumping up running across the field From the
parking lot his eyes meet Franks An IM SORRY shrug and
Frank turns his attention back to the game

The next pitch is high and outside

Frank takes a looping swingdriving the ball to the gap in
right center Frank jogs to first An easy single

From first Frank glances over at the third base coach
JULIA Her hair pinned up under a Mets cap Julia puts two

fingers in her mouth and belts out a loud whistle as

The next batter steps out of the dugout It is John
Sullivan

CLOSE ON
John as he makes his way to the plate

Check out his eyes theyre different he looks like his
father Theyve got that Frank Sullivan sparkle

John steps into the batters box cocks back to wood

FRANK
Bring me home son Bring me home

PHIRE POWER uncorks the fastest softball pitch youve ever
seen John jumps on it Rips a massive shot to deep center
way over the fence

The crew in the stands are on their feet cheering

Frank rounds third John catches up A double high-five from
Julia and they jog home together The game is over

Frank puts his arm around John Heading for the bleachers

A little boy totters up to them Jumping into Johns arms
His name is Frank Jr

JOHN
Hey there Chief
John gives his son a kiss glances up at Samantha in the
bleachers They share a smile And as they step off the
field his little boy reaches up takes Johns hat off his
head and puts it on his own

FRANK JR
Elvis has left the building

CLOSE ON

Johns face In his eyes bliss
