Tokyo Suckerpunch
screenplay

Ed Solomon

May 22 2007
Over BLACK we HEAR Billy’s (slightly overdramatic) voice

BILLY (V0)
Billy Chaka One man Two fists Ten
fingers flashing like fire Which
means only one thing to the demon
gangsters of the Yamagata Underworld

FULL-ON ANIMATION explodes onto the screen

BILLY (V0)
Sayonara

Wham Pow Like the best of Japanese ANIME Billy’s imagined
Tokyo brims with life as a buff handsome ultra-cool
CAUCASIAN MALE -- animated “BILLY CHAKA” -- spins leaps and
punches dispatching GANGSTERS with balletic grace as--

BILLY (VO)
Wham Smack Another Chaka sidekick
eracks the back of an attack yak hack
Billys a machine - unfeeling unfazed
And as always unattached

The final gangster slams against the wall of an ancient
Shinto shrine which Chaka enters to find a crying broken-
hearted SHRINE MAIDEN who looks up pleads

BILLY (VO)

“Save me Chaka-san -- lift the curse
with your kiss--

suddenly a TELEPHONE RINGS and EVERYTHING DISAPPEARS

INT BILLY’S CLEVELAND APARTMENT - NIGHT (LIVE ACTION)

BILLY CHAKA —- the real Billy Chaka -- is at a drawing table
in the bedroom of his modest apartment

(His is the apartment of a true Japanophile movie stills
samurai relics nunchucks And alli sorts of KARATE GEAR)

Super CLEVELAND OHIO

On the table are SKETCHES (what we saw animated) anda
DIGITAL RECORDER Billy sighs hits “speaker”

BILLY
If youd stop calling every fifteen
minutes I’d be done

SARAH’S VOICE
Meat is “done” Billy People are
“finished”

Billy rolls his eyes

SARAH’S VOICE
Scoff all you want--

“BILLY
I‘m rolling my eyes

SARAHS VOICE
All eye rolls are a kind of scoff
Not all scoffs are a kind of eye roll

BILLY
Do you ever stop

SARAH’S VOICE
Do you ever make a deadline without a
bullwhip on your ass Speaking of
which Anna called In travel You
never picked up your ticket --Hello

BILLY
I’m here

SARAH‘S VOICE
You have to go Billy Tomorrow You
know that Right Billy
Billy exhales As he hangs up the phone we CUT TO

ANIMATION A HAND grabs Billy and RIPS HIM FROM the MAIDEN
Billy spins it’s a sexy but sinister FEMALE SUPER-MOBSTER

BILLY (V0)

DragonFly -- arch nemesis -- Destroyer
of All That Is Art “Youre mine
Chaka” “Sure babe -- in your dreams”

Billy side-kicks DragonFly turns to the Shrine Maiden

BILLY (VO)
“Sayonara sweetheart”
(to himself)
Again

Now Billy dives into DragonFly -- slamming her backward and
throwing both of them off a bridge and onto a rushing TRANSIT
TRAIN Now ZOOMING THROUGH NEON-LACED MODERN TOKYO they
grapple fight alternating the upper hand

BILLY (V0)
“Prepare to die Chaka-san” Not
today -- I gotta walk my dog” Wham
52207 3

Chaka flips DragonFly hard as the train rushes into a tunnel
He has to press onto her to avoid decapitation

BILLY (V0)
Now pressed close to her chest he
heard no heartbeat Was it that the
sounds of the city were too deafening
Or was it that

The train exits the tunnel Chaka looks down Plunges his
fingers (a “knife hand”) into her chest and removes

BILLY (V0)
-her heart was made of stone

Heartless she winks then LEAPS OFF THE TRAIN and disappears
into the city Billy is left holding a heart-shaped piece of
earth as his train wipes out of frame and we MATCH CUT TO
INT BILLY’S APARTMENT -— NIGHT

The same images are now ARRANGED IN ORDER -- into a cover
page from a GRAPHIC NOVEL entitled “SAYONARA SWEETHEART”
Its scanned into a PDF then

He hits “SEND” and it DISAPPEARS into cyberspace leaving
only the words FILE SENT TO SARAH MEMPIREPUBLISHINGCOM

Billy exhales Looks down at the hand-drawn IMAGE of BILLY
ABOUT TO KISS THE SHRINE MAIDEN and we CUT TO
INT ZEN DO SHOTOKAN STUDIO - CLEVELAND - DAY

Billy -- in a BLACK BELT -- does an elaborate (and showy)
four-step counter-defense onto a heavy teachingMANNEQUIN

BILLY
Hee - haa -- haa - HEE KIAY

He turns He is teaching a group of LOWER BELT CHILDREN

BILLY
Okay Mason Go KIAY

MASON - 6 - leap-flails not really making much contact

BILLY

Ki-AY Next -- Lily Oops -- hang on

Billy kneels reties LILY‘’s belt
52207 4

LILY
Did you ever use this stuff Like on
bad guys or anything

Billy makes a brief non-committal gesture meant to convey
humility without in fact ruling anything out

VARIOUS KIDS
Come onPleaseYou have to tell

BILLY
The true master - he never tells
Now Again KIAY

INT COFFEE SHOP - CLEVELAND —- AFTERNOON

Billy a jacket over his karate uniform is with TWO FRIENDS
in a booth doing what they clearly do a lot argue arcane
points in pop culture as if discussing God and Death

All 3 are very vocal and Billy has to fight for air time

BILLY
No no no -- no Chan is The Clown
Lee is The Philosopher -- literally --
let me finish -- Jeet Kune Do is a
philosophy first--

SECOND GUY (EVAN)
Philosophy It’s “The Way of the
Intercepting Fist” Not like Faust

BILLY

(rolls his eyes)
That is lame “Faust” Read Lee’s
book Hell read anything Jackie
Chan is-- Would you let me finish

(waves them off)
I can’t have this conversation I
can‘t talk to philistines

Billy stands Starts away His friends scoff

SECOND GUY (DAN)
Dude you know you’re gonna like turn
right around and --

As if on cue Billy turns back

BILLY
Jackie Chan was a reaction to Bruce
Lee And Sammo Hung But his lineage
is Keaton and Chaplin not the Shaolin
-- yes -- he was sold to the Peking
(MORE)
52207 5
BILLY (contd)
Opera How can you not know this
How can you not know this and call
yourself a human being

Billy stops short as an ADORABLE WAITRESS drops the check

WAITRESS
Can I get you guys anything else

General shakings of the head The Waitress ever-so-slightly
smiles at Billy as she leaves A come-on or just politeness

BILLY
You saw that right That like
fleeting sparkle In her eye

DAN
Dude -- here’s an idea for a Billy
Chaka story lame loser totally
misinterprets routine politeness for
covert come-on

Billy ignoring him grabs the check and

APPROACHING THE COUNTER

Billy “super-humbly” hands the Waitress the check tray

BILLY
Sup Other day I left a pen a drawing
pen -- I do these graphic novel

things no big just a lot of silly
scribbling Don’t know why they publish
it In as many languages as they do

WAITRESS
Sorry I haven’t seen a pen

BILLY
Well if you do maybe you can bring
it by Zen Do Shotokan across the
street I’m there a lot

Despite the fact that she can totally see through him
there’s something endearing about how he’s trying so hard

WAITRESS
Karate guy huh

Billy makes a masterfully “humble” gesture meant to convey
that yes he is but in truth he’s really modest about it
52207 6

BILLY
Bit You know whatever Teach
I’m sure you’re told this a-lot but
you’ve got a kind of a Neve Campbell
thing going

SARAH (0S)
Excuse me “sensei”

Billy turns It’s SARAH Young quite pretty -- but with a
tough shell

BILLY
Oh Hello Sarah

In the BG Billy’s friends watch (“Uh oh mom’s here”
“Busted”) as Sarah pulls him past the waitress to the door

SARAH
Sorry to interrupt the Kung Fu -
Hustle
(mock surprise)
Ohmigod Is that Nev Campbell

BILLY
Shut up

SARAH
Waiting tables in Cleveland

BILLY
First of all it’s pronounced Neve

She ushers him into the glass foyer

SARAH
Why don’t you ask her yourself
(as the door closes)
Perfect for you Billy A waitress
She serves you she’s independent
enough to work but not rich enough to
threaten you financially--

BILLY

Did we date You and me
SARAH

Us
BILLY

Then why are you constantly acting
like an ex-girlfriend
52207 7

SARAH
(digging thru her purse)
Because because I’ve had yet
another long Billy Chaka-centered
day that’s all
(hands him an envelope)
Tokyo Ticket itinerary

‘BILLY
Why would I fly all the way to Japan
to see some Swedish robo-thespian’s
lame depiction of me

SARAH
First of all it’s not you It’s an
adolescent male fantasy version of
you

BILLY
It’s me

SARAH
It’s a character you named after you
Which we own And optioned to the New
Niigata Film Finance Group For which
you signed a contract Which includes
their right to your services for
publicity Did you just say “Swedish
robo-thespian”

BILLY
I did

SARAH
I thought so Well you didn’t go to
the Pan-Asia Comic-Con -- fine You

were invited to judge three anime
festivals Why are you avoiding this

BILLY
Because I can’t Literally
(quieter)
I don’t -- I don’t fly well
He hands her back the packet She returns it to his hands

SARAH
Thats why they have airplanes Billy

She turns and walks out Billy hesitates and then

EXT COFFEE SHOP - “COFFEE ARABIA” — CONTINUOUS

Billy exits into the cold Crosses the snowy icy lot
52207 8

BILLY
Adolescent

SARAH
(turning en route to car)
What

BILLY
You said my work is adolescent How

SARAH
Damsels in distress Black-and-white
villains And a protagonist with the
emotional life of a high school boy

BILLY
That is so not true--

SARAH
Okay You’re right I get it

She starts into her car Billy stops her

BILLY
But you don’t really You’re just
saying that to end the conversation

SARAH
Then tell me what you want me to say
that will end this conversation
Because I’ve worked all day and it
doesn’t matter Seriously

BILLY
(beat exhales)
You‘re right It doesn’t

She starts in again Then stops as Billy can’t help himself—-

BILLY
But it does Cause what qualifies you
to tell me what to do with a character
you don’t even like OR understand
Especially given that A I’ve written
twenty-two graphic novels -- that’s like
two hundred stories B youre two years
younger than me and C last year this
time you were editing coffee table books
of dogs crossing the Delaware and
kittens dangling from chin-up bars

SARAH
Are you serious
52207 9

BILLY
Yes
SARAH
You seriously want me to answer this
BILLY
Yes
SARAH

Fine Your cultural references are thin
You have no grasp of the deeper mythology
or any of the social contexts Your what-—
you-call Japanese is “conversant tourist”

at best You work in stereotypes

You

have no objectivity about your own work

which to you is akin to holy writ

You

can’t spell AND -- shocker of all --

youve never even BEEN to Japan

Billy just stands there Sarah realizes she hit too hard

SARAH
Did I hurt your feelings I didn’t
mean to hurt your feelings

BILLY
No No no nono You kidding

SARAH
Cause I don’t want things to be
awkward for us on this trip

BILLY
Wait What do you mean for us

We HEAR the roaring whine of a JET ENGINE and CUT TO

DOLPH LUNDGREN

Riding a motorcycle -- fearless -- right toward camera as we
WHOOSH AROUND with him and follow him off the top of a

ZEPPELIN and into mid-air as suddenly --

JAPANESE WRITING EXPLODES THROUGH THE SCREEN AND we are

EXT GINZA DISTRICT - TOKYO —- NIGHT
CLOSE ON BILLY mouth agape looking up as --

ON A HUGE 70 FOOT SCREEN ABOVE THE NEON GINZA
THE “TOKYO SUCKERPUNCH” MOVIE plays

a giant AD FOR
52207 10

REVERSE ANGLE - FROM HIGH ABOVE LOOKING DOWN We see TINY
BILLY amid a crowd of JAPANESE PEOPLE just standing there
incredulous his SUITCASE at his feet as --

THI

E ON SCREEN TRAILER ends with a bunch of JAPANESE WRITING

followed by BILLY’S ANIMATED DRAWING OF HIMSELF and the
English words “IN THREE DAYS BILLY CHAKA WILL SAVE TOKYO”

Billy just gapes as the screen returns to what was showing
an odd Japanese GAME SHOW where people in plastic bags jump
around trying to sweat the most and Sarah comes up to him
She’s excited -- she loves it here She FLASHES a photo

SARAH
Okay I got directions It’s this tiny
sushi joint in Fukugawa And Im telling
you -- Billy Chaka would love this place

BILLY
Did you see that Like a thousand
feet wide above the whole city

SARAH
Yeah -- you’re gonna save Tokyo In
three days You better get in shape
(re directions)
‘Kay we have to take the Tozai line--

BILLY
It sucks I can tell already

SARAH

(sags turns)
And there’s nothing to be gained by
obsessing Mister Whirly-brain so you
may as well enjoy the fact that you’re
in TOKYO On SOMEONE ELSES DIME
And I made us a reservation and we‘re
just gonna drop our bags with the
bellman—-

BILLY
I’m kind of jet-lagged And with the
premiere tomorrow I just kinda
wanna go to my room and get some
sleep

Sarah looks at him Disappointed

SARAH
Fine Whatever I’m in Tokyo I’m
having an adventure --And I know

yous you’re not gonna sleep
52207 11

BILLY
Im so gonna sleep

CLOSE ON COMPUTER SCREEN

We’re on the MESSAGE BOARD of “BILLYCHAKACOM” Someone
named ChakaFan6 is clarifying some obscure point from an
obscure episode No no no -- it was OBVIOUSLY the same
masterless samurai as in volume III The SCAR Hello Try
actually READING IT We PULL BACK and reveal

INT TINY JAPANESE HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT - SAME
This is Billy typing -- anonymously -- as “ChakaFan6é”

BILLY
(to screen)
Hel-lo Mister Lame Are you blind

The PHONE rings Billy picks up

BILLY
How was your night on the town

SARAHS VOICE (THROUGH PHONE)
Are you ChakaFan6

Billy quickly “quits” out of the message board

BILLY
No God no Jesus

SARAH’S VOICE (THROUGH PHONE)
Good thing cause what could be more
creepy than some guy trolling his own
message board at three in the morning

BILLY
Some so-called editor apparently doing
the exact same thing

SARAH‘S VOICE
Yeah well I wasn’t on for very long
Unlike ChakaFan6 who’s been logged in
for like two and a half hours

There’s a KNOCK Billy turns Rises Opens the door
Sarah enters hanging up her cordless room phone
SARAH
Okay how much do I love this city I

was just at a place where they float

This room is small It’s so
cubist No that’s not right

BILLY
Are you okay

SARAH
I can’t sleep I’m all whoa

(points over his shoulder)
I have the same wallpaper But your
lilies are like swimming Towards
your head

Billy looks back then looks at Sarah
BILLY
My lilies wait
(smiles)
You took an Ambien

SARAH
I believe that is correct yes

BILLY
Okay Okay you know what Let’s get
you to bed

He grabs her arm Leads her out of his room and --

INTO THE HALLWAY

-- toward her room which is right across the hall from his
She stops mid-route and stares straight down at the carpet

SARAH
Now that is weird

BILLY
Room key

SARAH

(handing him key)
This is so counter to my personal
plan

BILLY
Which was
52207 13

SARAH
To never under any circumstances let
you into my room

He leads her into --

HER ROOM — CONTINUING
And prepares a place for her on her bed
BILLY
So you’ve actually thought about
this so much that you have a plan

SARAH
Not a plan a vow

BILLY
(setting her on the bed)
Wow Wow Well the good news is you
won’t remember any of this

SARAH
Thank God

Suddenly Billy gets an idea He turns rushes through the
door -- which he leaves open and quickly crosses to --

HIS ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Where he quickly riffles through his toiletry kit and grabs
something Then a moment later he’s back —-

IN SARAH’S ROOM

And with Sarah already sound asleep he removes a condom
from the package and pocketing the condom he leaves the

torn wrapper on the night-stand He starts out

Then stops Takes off his socks and leaves one under a
sheet and the other at the end of the bed

He leaves shutting the door And we CUT TO

CLOSE ON SARAH THE NEXT DAY

Horrified Staring ahead We WIDEN and reveal she’s in
52207 14

A TAXI - AFTERNOON - MOVING

And Billy in a SUIT AND TIE is sitting next to her With a
look of mischievous glee Which he milks for a writhingly
tortuous long time Finally he leans close and whispers

BILLY
I think we should forget it ever
happened

SARAH

Forget what ever happened

BILLY
Exactly Clearly it was a moral - not
to mention professional - lapse
(leans close again)
By the way I called the hotel I
personally will reimburse them for the
ceiling fan

Now Sarah slugs him Billy starts to crack up

SARAH
You prick You PRICK

BILLY
Hey -- if you didn’t think it was a
possibility you wouldnt be so upset

SARAH
It’s not a possibility Billy It
will never be a possibility

BILLY
Which is why you’re so upset

Sarah pulls out the torn condom wrapper

SARAH
No I’m upset because I found this in
my room and
(stops grins)
Oh My God Oh My Effing God
(turns)
This expired like two years ago

BILLY
What Gimme that --

SARAH
(keeps it away)
You know what that means You’ve been
carrying this for like at least two
years I love this
52207 15

BILLY
That is so not true

SARAH
Wait -- no It actually means you
haven’t even had sex in two years

BILLY
(grabs it - looks at it)
This did not expire

The taxi pulls to a stop
SARAH
But if you didn’t think it was a
possibility you wouldn’t be so upset
HA HA
The TAXI DOOR is pulled open by publicity people

FLASH APPLAUSE Billy turns -- quickly tosses the wrapper
back in the taxi -- and steps out And we CUT TO

BILLY - AT A TABLE - A FEW MINUTES LATER

Signing piles of graphic novels With each one he does a
QUICK ILLUSTRATION -- he’s actually quite talented

BILLY
“For Takayuki Keep on rockin’
Billy Chaka”

Another eager fan hands him one of his graphic novels

TEENAGE BOY
Yoshio desu

BILLY
“For Yoshio Rockin’ the east
Billy Chaka”

Yoshio high-fives his pal Billy reaches grabs another

BILLY
Alright Whos

Suddenly there’s COMMOTION and people start yelling “BILLY
CHAKA” Billy rises expectant until he realizes that
they’re not yelling at him rather they’re yelling at

AN OPENING LIMOUSINE DOOR

“Out of which steps DOLPH LUNDGREN
52207 16

People go nuts Billy’s eyes rest on a billboard that says
“DOLPH LUNDGREN IS BILLY CHAKA IN TOKYO SUCKERPUNCH”

Billy sighs resigned as the crowd drains And he hears

A WOMAN’S VOICE
Billy Chaka

He turns And freezes Because standing before him is

THE MOST BEAUTIFUL GIRL HE’S EVER SEEN Long dark hair
gorgeous figure early 20’s

And she seems sort of nervous as she holds a graphic novel
Billy points to himself and behind himself to Dolph

BILLY
D’you mean me me him me

WOMAN
Real you Will you sign please

She holds out the novel

BILLY
Wow - a first edition Who do I make
this out to

YUKO

YUKO

BILLY

get you

52207

Billy raises his hands as if to welcome a gift from Heaven

YUKO
I love idea that there is a literal
pulse to Tokyo Is true

BILLY
Well she thought it was pretentious
and overwritten

SARAH (0S)
Actually I thought it was derivative

Sarah and an OFFICIOUS MAN arrive - each with clipboards

SARAH
Sorry to interrupt This is Mr
Miyashiro He’s in publicity He
needs some photos

BILLY
Right Oh Sarah This is Yuko We
were just having an interesting
conversation
(to Yuko)
Tell her what you were telling me
Tell her in Japanese

Yuko and Sarah exchange bows and engage in a

fluent
conversation It goes back and forth For a while

Billy

understands not a word Finally both turn back to Billy

SARAH
We are agreeing to disagree
(turns moves away)
You can rejoin the Billy Chaka
gushfest in a moment Billy

Billy hesitates a moment to make sure Sarah’s not turning
back then he turns to Yuko and removes his ROOM KEY

BILLY
Listen I don’t know where this is
but you’1ll know It’s the hotel and
my room number -- maybe later you can
give me a call maybe we can -
52207 18

A HAND takes the key It’s the hand of an OLDER VERY
IMPOSING LOOKING MAN who barks something at Yuko before
joining a group of what appear to be SECURITY PEOPLE

BILLY
What just happened

YUKO
That was my father

BILLY
(embarrassed)
Oh God I’m so sorry

Two more SECURITY PEOPLE flank Yuko to lead her away

YUKO
It’s not you Goodbye Billy Chaka
It was an honor to meet you

Billy watches the men lead her away

INT MOVIE THEATER - SHORTLY THEREAFTER

Billy is sitting by Sarah in the VIP section as someone (the
director) speaks up front Something’s on Billy’s mind

BILLY
For the record It could also mean I
kept it in my travel kit and I just
don’t travel a lot

SARAH
What are you talking about

BILLY
The condom

SARAH
Oh my god you’re still on that Fine
You’re the Don Juan of Cleveland--

DOLPH LUNDGREN
Excuse me Billy Chaka

Dolph Lundgren shimmies past heading for the (reserved) seat
next to Billy He offers his hand

DOLPH LUNDGREN

(smiles)
Kidding Dolph Lundgren It’s an
honor to meet you Really I love

52207 19

BILLY
Thanks Um yours uh too

DOLPH LUNDGREN

BILLY SARAH
Ha Hardly

Dolph leans over Billy and offers his hand to Sarah

DOLPH LUNDGREN
I saw you earlier at the press
conference In fact I couldn’t take
my eyes off you You at the Otani

Billy rolls his eyes as the lights fade and the music starts

INT THEATER - AN HOUR LATER

ON SCREEN Dolph Lundgren rides a MOTORCYCLE spewing
bullets from MACHINE GUNS strapped to each arm Behind him
one arm around his back the other firing another machine
gun is TAWNY KITAEN as “DRAGONFLY”

REVERSE ANGLE Billy slumped low curled into a foetal ball
in his chair peers through his fingers in horror

DOLPH LUNDGREN AS BILLY CHAKA (0S)
Hows it goin’ danger

Billy grabs Sarah’s shoulder mouths that last line in

stupified disbelief “Hows it goin’ danger” She gives

him a stern “knock it off look

EXT PREMIERE PARTY - NIGHT

Packed HOSTS AND HOSTESSES in Billy Chaka shades and red

Chakastyle leather jackets All around are IMAGES OF

fictional BILLY CHAKAS ANIMATED ones DOLPH LUNDGREN ones

Dozens of tables under a huge tent Music A bar

OVER IN A CORNER Billy with Dolph in a heated discussion
DOLPH LUNDGREN

Cool ending though The thing with
DragonFly
52207 20

BILLY
But he wouldn’t’ve kissed her he
would’ve killed her

DOLPH LUNDGREN
You kidding Billy Chaka wouldn’t do
that

BILLY
(incredulous)
What

DOLPH LUNDGREN
He’s in love with her
(off Billy’s dropped jaw)
It’s the subtext of the whole comic
book Sorry -- graphic novel

Billy’s look of astonishment defies description

BILLY
Shes the bane of his existence If
he didn’t hate her why would they
always be fighting

DOLPH LUNDGREN
She’s the only one who sees him for
who he really is That’s why he’s so
afraid of her

Before stunned Billy can respond a hand slaps his shoulder

SARAH
(a bit of a smile)
Hows it goin’ danger

Dolph perks up -- slides out a chair for Sarah

DOLPH LUNDGREN
Hey
(then re Billy)
This guy has no idea who Billy Chaka
is

SARAH
I’ve been trying to tell him that for
two years

Billy gives Dolph a “one sec” finger

BILLY
Can you excuse us a second

(rises and pulls Sarah aside)
Okay One the Swedish robo-thespian
is apparently the world’s foremost

(MORE)
52207
BILLY (contd)

Billy Chaka expert Two this
debacle is nothing like my stories
No mystic temples No ravishing
geishas It’s like I’ve been raped
It’s like dream rape

(looking over her shoulder)
Oh my God The director Tokyo
Mengele Hide me

Indeed the director TOMIYUKI KIKUCHI - surrounded by a
phalanx of press and co-workers - approaches riding high

SARAH
Do yourself - do everyone - a favor
Those last two things Never say them
again Especially to him

BILLY
Give me some credit Christ

TOMIYUKI KIKUCHI
So Honestly I really want to know
what you think

Sarah gives Billy a look

BILLY
Honestly

Kikuchi beams Dozens listen Billy hesitates

BILLY
You know I’m really not a director
So my own ideas maybe I’ma bit
too close to them

TOMIYUKI KIKUCHI
I understand

BILLY
Good Thank you

Billy exhales -- relieved Sarah nods See You gan do
And then -- just as Kikuchi is about to turn away

BILLY
Do you though Actually
SARAH TOMIYUKI KIKUCHI
Please God no (turns back)

I’m sorry

BILLY
Do you actually understand

it
52207 22

In fact Kikuchi understands full well and is trying to help
Billy save face

TOMIYUKI KIKUCHI
You feel that you had your own ideas
for what this could have been and you
are content to leave them as separate
but equal coexistences

BILLY
Yes Exactly
(unable to help himself)
Except actually I wouldnt use
the word “equal”

SARAH
Billy --

TOMIYUKI KIKUCHI
Thank you I understand

BILLY
Do you Because for the record
This isn’t like some “story” youve
violated It’s my life Worse it’s
my dreams Do you understand that you
have raped my dreams

Silence Everyone is staring CUT TO

OFF IN A CORNER - TWO MINUTES LATER

Sarah livid lashes into Billy as Miyashiro waits nearby

SARAH
There’s a moment Billy a moment which
happens - in most sentient beings --

right between having the thought and
expressing the thought It is within
that moment that a process called
editing occurs It is precisely that
process which safeguards most people
from looking like assholes

BILLY
Fine You know what I should never
have come to Japan I’m gonna go home--

SARAH
Oh no You’re not getting off that
easily Mr Miyashiro is going to
take you back to your room where you
are going to sit And wait Till I
figure a way for you to fix this
(MORE )
52207 23
SARAH (contd)
Lest you go out in public and create
yet more of a mess Repeat what I
just said

BILLY
I heard you

SARAH
And if you don’t go back right now I
am not even going to find someone else
to write Billy Chaka I’m going to
write Billy Chaka And you just wait
and see what I do to him

WITH MIYASHIRO AND BILLY - A MOMENT LATER

He leads a chagrined Billy past disapproving glances As
Miyashiro stops to grab a packet from a table Billy hears

YUKO (0S)
Billy Chaka
Billy turns Yuko is standing at the bar A stiff drink in

her hand Billy lights up She is gorgeous - and sexy (As
always her ubiquitous SECURITY MEN hover nearby)

BILLY
Yuko Hi
YUKO
You were right Was nothing like your
stories
BILLY
Oh Yeah well
(then)

Hey would you want I have to go

back to my thing but I don’t

know you ever wanna get a coffee
(re her glass)

Or something stronger

YUKO
I always prefer something stronger

BILLY
Hence the big men with you

YUKO
My father is a little over-protective
I see you have bodyguard also

Miyashiro has returned and is waiting impatiently
52207 24

BILLY
He’s new in my life But it’s already
getting a little old

YUKO
I would think of all people Billy
Chaka can take care of himself

Yuko’s look lingers as Miyashiro indicates “lets go” Billy
hesitates -- then as he starts to walk off with Miyashiro
he leans close to Yuko

BILLY
Meet me at the back exit in two
minutes Without the babysitters

Billy continues off with Miyashiro then takes a look over
his shoulder -- Yuko is doing the same toward him

Billy turns back Breathes heavily -- charged
BILLY
(to Miyashiro)
I just one sec I just need to use
the rest room

He points to a “toilet” sign Miyashiro nods Waits Billy
walks toward the sign and as he gets just out of view

He darts around a series of catering carts and ends up

AT THE BACK EXIT - A MOMENT LATER

He arrives and glances about But sees no Yuko He sags
Then she grabs him - pulls him behind a pillar as --

They both see Miyashiro looking for Billy And -- not more
than ten feet from him - Yuko’s own SECURITY MEN They pull
each other back BEHIND A PILLAR And now --

They are right next to each other up close For both of
them this is kind of exciting They look at each other

And they make a mad dash to the street laughing like school
children playing hooky

BILLY
Taxi Um Takushil

INT TAXI - A SECOND LATER

They dive in collapsing on top of each other giggling

BILLY
Go Go go

Yuko says the same in Japanese and the cab pulls into
traffic Out the back window Billy and Yuko see the
disappearing forms of her two minders running to the street
Billy turns to Yuko and they give each other a high-five

Then keep their hands clasped And it’s electric -- neither
wants to let go

BILLY
We did it

They continue to look at each other as

EXT BUSY STREET - SAME

The cab moves off into the night We HOLD a moment As

A VAN -- a black one with tinted windows -- rumbles into
frame And fo the taxi into the ni

INT SUPER-HIP JAPANESE CLUB - NIGHT

ELECTROCLASH - an uber-hip mash-up of punk and techno
Elevated turntables Jam-packed Decor found only in Tokyo

PLASMA SCREENS flash images of BEAUTIFULLY PREPARED DISHES
(As a plate passes the service window the chef hits a button
and a PHOTO FLASHES - and the image appears on the screens)
AT A CORNER BOOTH

Billy and Yuko leaning in to each other Holding hands
Still very charged Sexy Yuko downs a large whisky

BILLY
You’re good at that

YUKO
Much practice You know you saved
me

BILLY

What - just now

YUKO
All my life My father he was very
busy very cold Distant And
‘sometimes difficult
If Billy were holding his glass right now he

52207

BILLY
He kinda gave me the creeps

YUKO
No offense He just has a problem
with the West

BILLY
So do I What’s his beef

YUKO
After the war the West imposed a
constitution which forbade us to
militarize That’s why the Tokyo
police don’t carry guns My father
hates this

BILLY
Sixty-five years -- man knows how to
hold a grudge

YUKO
My father and his friends they are
very old fashioned We argue a lot
But when things get bad I always have
Billy Chaka to go to in my room

BILLY
I kinda feel that way about Billy Chaka
too I mean not me but you know
the one I write I can’t tell you the
amount of times he’s saved me

YUKO
Sometimes I would fantasize I was
DragonFly And he would rescue me
And then we would make love

YUKO
I think Billy Chaka he is in love
with DragonFly Yes

She leans closer her fingertips gracing his arm

BILLY
You know it’s funny sometimes
writers are the last to see what I
guess is obvious to others

YUKO
You really are brave
(off his non-committal gesture)
Yes Most men are afraid to date me

would drop it
52207

BILLY
Because you’re so beautiful

YUKO
(shakes her head)
Because of my father

BILLY
Mister Over-Protective
YUKO
But I think Billy Chaka is not afraid
BILLY
Of course not
(then)

Why Should I be

YUKO
Ive had problems before

BILLY
W What do you mean

YUKO
My old boyfriend got into a car
accident It wasn’t his fault but I
broke my arm A week later he
vanished No one knew what happened

Billy is frozen She leans closer Takes his hand

YUKO
But you can protect yourself You’re’
Billy Chaka

BILLY
Uhh yes But maybe we should run
you home soon

YUKO
No This night is too special

BILLY
Actually I think your bodyguards are
sorta losing patience

YUKO
They don’t know I’m here
BILLY
I think they do They’re right over

there

Yuko turns Sees what Billy’s looking at
52207 28

Standing at the far wall is a guy with a PUNCHPERM HAIRCUT
(tight permed curls) and another who has DYED BLOND HAIR

YUKO
Those aren’t my bodyguards
(takes his hand)
We have to go

BILLY
Seriously -- you don’t know them

As she rises the men begin moving Right toward Billy and
Yuko And Billy sees TWO MORE MEN (one with a CREW CUT and
one in SUNGLASSES) step out from the shadows along the back
wall They are also moving toward them

BILLY
Shit Shit shit shit

Billy backpedals pulls Yuko --

Into the kitchen Billy and Yuko whirl then hurry through
picking up speed as sous-chefs yell and flee as --

-- the FOUR MEN file in after them Now running
BILLY
Keep going Go out the back TI’1ll

Yuko bolts for the back door as Billy turns and protectively
springs into a KARATE STANCE as the men bear down on him

BILLY
Kiay

Crewcut instantly JABS Billy in the throat Billy gurgles --

BILLY
Khkhhhh-ghh-khh

-- and with what amounts to mild irritation Crewcut grabs
him and as if he were simply repositioning an in-the-way
coat-stand lifts Billy and places him to the side

Billy stands there choking -- frozen in his karate stance --
as all four pass each delivering a blow to a different part
of Billy’s body WHACK -- WHOOMPH -— SLAP -- CRUNCH

The men rapidly gain on Yuko who runs out the back exit
52207 29

YUKO (0S)
Billy Chaka Hurry

Billy turns tries to gather his breath - and his courage
And as the last man (Punchperm) grabs the door Billy runs --

BILLY
YyyyyAAAAAAAAAAAAA——

-- and Punchperm effortlessly rotates grabs Billy’s collar
and -- WHAM -- guides him headfirst into the wall

BILLY
OQoowwwww

He then slams Billy backwards onto the service window
Theres a FLASH and --

THROUGHOUT THE RESTAURANT

Billy’s smushed face - wincing - is projected on all 8 plasma
tvs Then a DIFFERENT IMAGE of Billy’s face -- this time
writhing in pain under a clenched hand -- is projected as

KITCHEN

WHAMFLASH -- WHAMFLASH -- Billys face is repeatedly
slammed against the service window

Billy flails behind him fingers groping for a weapon He
finally manages to find one swings his hand wildly forward --

PUNCHPERM
AAHHHHH

-- and Punchperm leaps away yelling in agony Billy rises --
lunges forward with the knife

BILLY
Stop Halt St shit

and then slows as he realizes that blood is spurting from
where Punchperm’s FINGER used to be Punchperm is livid

BILLY
Accident -- total accident --

Punchperm grabs a cleaver and -- THHWWICK -- THHWICKK --
Billy dodges desperate until -- thhhhhwaaaack -- the
cleaver lodges in a cabinet inches from Billy’s head

There’s the sound of SIRENS as the door opens and Blondie
YELLS in Punchperm grabs Billy and pulls his face close

52207 30

PUNCHPERM
You tell police we kill girl

He headbutts Billy then goes Billy staggers out --

screeches off into the night Leaving

Billy breathing heavily at the back door to the kitchen
taking in the enormity of what just happened And we CUT TO
INT ROPPONGI OTANI HOTEL - HALLWAY - NIGHT - SAME

Sarah exits the elevator and walks at a crisp click with a
BRITISH MAN (FRANK - her boss) Frank is livid

FRANK
He called him a rapist -- it’s on the
ten o’clock news --

They arrive at Billy’s door - where Frank insistently KNOCKS

SARAH
Technically it was “dream rapist” He
was trying to be metaphoric -- which I

know isn’t a strong point --

(as Frank knocks again)
He’s exhausted Hes probably sound
asleep Frank I promise he’1ll
rectify this

FRANK
Tomorrow night Toya building -- the
banquet He apologizes in public
And he means it

Frank turns away then turns back

FRANK
I said there was no budget for you to
be here You said you were needed
Why For one purpose to wrangle
Chaka So wrangle him Or he and you
can start looking for a new job

Frank storms off As he rounds the corner Sarah sags
Turns Starts toward her room -- then freezes

SARAH
Abh
52207 31

Because Billy is peering out of the SOFT DRINK ALCOVE with a

look-of urgency on his face She charges him -- livid
SARAH
Where the hell have you --
BILLY
SHHHH SHHH
He yanks her into the alcove -- a hand over her mouth
SARAH

BILLY

(keeping hand on her mouth)
I’m going to tell you something but

react

SARAH

Billy turns Picks up an ICE BUCKET Removes the lid And
shows her the finger In it On ice Then looks at her

SARAH
You have somebodys finger

BILLY

SARAH
That’s not a judgement - it’s a
statement
BILLY

52207 32

But there’s judgement implied --

SARAH
Billy

A ROOM SERVICE GUY passes with cart

BILLY

Billy replaces the lid

Okay Sarah Remember the girl
Yuko Who you hated because she was

way into me

SARAH
I didn’t hate her Billy

BILLY

Well whatever Well I sorta talked
her into ditching her bodyguards

And well

SARAH
-She has bodyguards

BILLY

And this odd thing happened which
resulted in her sort of getting kind
of kidnapped But that’s not really

the problem either

SARAH
Im sorry There’s more

‘BILLY

A bit See she sorta had this
boyfriend once and he got into this
fender bender thing -- totally not his
fault -- and he like her father made

him totally vanish

She just stares at him Like she’s looking at one of those
three-D images that has yet to take form

SARAH

Billy Seriously Some terrorist
organization should literally recruit
you to just walk around unsupervised

BILLY

Please Can we go to my room I’m

holding a finger

He starts across the hall She follows still stunned

Billy and Sarah spin

BILLY SARAH
Holy shit Ahhh

There is A VERY SEVERE-LOOKING MAN sitting on the chair by
the window This is NAGAO

Nagao is holding one of Billy’s graphic novels Billy is
still holding the bucket

NAGAO
Your metaphors are forced Your subtext
is obvious In general I find your
comic books strained and overwrought

BILLY
Who are you How did you get in here

Nagao holds up Billy’s ROOM KEY

“NAGAO
I believe you gave this to my employer
whose daughter was last witnessed
stepping into a taxicab with you At
what time may we expect her home

BILLY
Um you know it’s funny --
52207

Nagao holds up his hand Billy is silenced

NAGAO
Perhaps I should speak in less
elliptical terms if Yuko is not home
by sunrise you will find yourself
visiting all four islands of Japan
at the same time And that goes for
your girlfriend too

BILLY
Yuko

SARAH
(flat)
He means me

BILLY
But you’re not my girlfriend
(to Nagao)
She’s not my girlfriend She’s my
editor And she has nothing to do
with this So leave her out of it
And it’s a graphic novel by the way

NAGAO
Duly noted I stand corrected on all
accounts
(rises)

Let‘s hope for both of your sake that
we never have to meet again Sayonara

The instant he’s gone Sarah runs to the phone Billy
wrestles her for it

BILLY

About two hours ago And no

Billy and Sarah share a look Sarah shrugs -- “your call”
Billy opens the ice bucket and pulls out the finger

EXT TOKYO POLICE STATION - A LITTLE WHILE LATER

A taxi pulls away leaving Billy and Sarah on the curb looking
at the FISHERMAN AHOY BAR Billy still holds the bucket

filled with men with sleeve-length TATTOOS

Billy and Sarah stop

BILLY

She ushers him back --

OUTSIDE THE BAR
And swiftly herds him across the street away from the bar

BILLY

SARAH
Did you see their tattoos That’s the
patchwork dragon

BILLY
Wait -- what

SARAH
The patchwork dragon Lee Jay Yoon
The Korean guy

BILLY
Why is that familiar

SARAH
Because he’s the guy you based all of

BILLY
The Butcher of Busan

SARAH

But this is the real guy The “Tailor
of Taegu” Who resews the limbs of
victims back on backwards

(calls)
Takushi

(to Billy)

doing unlike other people

BILLY
Youre talking about me
SARAH
I’m talking exactly about you -- who

is holding the finger of a guy who
works for the Tailor of Taegu Ina
bucket Think about it Billy Think
about it

52207 39

After a long moment

BILLY
First of all I didn’t base volume
seven on anyone I totally made it up
whole cloth

SARAH
Billy

BILLY
But you’re right You’re right We
have to go back

She nods relieved A cab arrives She opens the door

BILLY
It’s just there’s no way Billy
Chaka would risk Yuko’s life like
that Especially if he’s responsible
for her being in trouble

SARAH
If you were that Billy Chaka she would
never have gotten kidnapped in the
first place But this is real life
So please Get in Please

Billy stands there Sarah does too

SARAH
Get in now Or I’m leaving

Billy remains motionless staring at her She stares back
There’s a pause And we CUT TO

looks back notices Sarah seems upset Speaks Japanese

Sarah shakes her head (Bold dialogue is subtitled)

SARAH
Excuse me If I may I would like to
respectfully ask permission to pound
on your seat

THE CAB DRIVER

Suddenly the ANIME DISAPPEARS and we realize we are --

INT CAFE - SAME

Billy -- in a window booth at a restaurant -- has been
SKETCHING IN A NOTEBOOK A DRAWING OF BILLY THREATENING A
PUNCHPERMED MOBSTER IN A MOB BAR He shuts off the DIGITAL
RECORDER he’s been speaking into Looks up embarrassed

BILLY
Oh Hi How long have you been here

Sarah is standing next to him looking down

SARAH
How long have you been here

BILLY
The whole time

SARAH
You didn’t

She indicates through the window where the FISHERMAN AHOY
BAR is visible on the other side of the street

BILLY
For a moment I almost went back and
then
52207 41
She sits relieved —- and conflicted

SARAH
I swear to God Billy I’m coming back
here trying to keep you from killing
yourself -- and all the while I’m
wishing you were dead Can I

She goes to reach for his sketch-pad He stops her

BILLY
No - no It’s lame It’s fake

Theres a pause

SARAH
Listen It’s 7 am in Cleveland I
left a message at legal --
(off Billy’s reaction)
I didnt give them information I
told them to call me as soon as they
get in I just think we should --

BILLY
That’s them

Through the window Billy sees a BLACK VAN pull up by the bar
and the GUY WITH THE PUNCHPERM -- his hand now BANDAGED at
the finger -- get out Billy slides out of view

BILLY
That’s the guy who told me he’d kill
her if we call the police

After a beat the van PULLS AWAY And --

Punchperm and the other THREE MEN we saw earlier half-
walkhalf-carry a FIFTH PERSON -- a WOMAN (hard to see) --
up the steps and into the bar They’re rough with her

BILLY
That’s her Is that her

Sarah a bit shaken watches through the window as the person
(probably Yuko) is shoved in through the door

SARAH
JeSuS

Billy returns to his seated position

BILLY
Someone has to go in there Right now
Someone has to go in and do something
(MORE)
52207 42
BILLY (contd)
And if that person doesn’t go right
now he‘ll talk himself out of it

SARAH

Billy moves to the door A beat He turns to Sarah Looks
at her Then turns one more time and is out the door
EXT STREET

Billy steels himself takes a breath and crosses

INT CAFE - SAME

Sarah just stares On the one hand she feels defeated On
the other there’s a part of her which despite herself has
to sort of respect him for doing it A pause

She sits glances at his recorder Hits “PLAY”

It was clear the gaadoshta was under
new ownership - and that owner was

Billy kicking open the mob door as
INSIDE THE BAR - SAME
Billy enters slowly Looks around It’s scary

He stops Turns It’s BLONDIE

Blondie suckerpunches Billy who slams into a table with a
loud crash turning stunned to find he is now sandwiched
between SUNGLASSES and CREWCUT who each slug him --

BILLY’S VOICE (ON RECORDER)
Wham Crack It’s a back-to-back yak-
smackin’ Chak-attack

As Billy is then grabbed and we CUT TO

A ROOM UPSTAIRS

Where Billy is thrown down into a chair And is sitting
directly across from YUKO who is tightly BOUND at the hands
and feet and GAGGED at the mouth

BILLY’S VOICE (ON RECORDER)
(as a girl)
“I knew youd come Kiss me Billy”

Yuko stares -- saddened and surprised to see Billy suddenly
KICKED IN THE GUT He doubles over crumples to the floor
He’s kicked again And again When he looks up --

BILLY’S VOICE (ON RECORDER)

“No time babe Lets blow this squid-
on-a-stick stand”

Yuko is being dragged out a back exit by FOUR OTHER MEN

BILLY

And the door is slammed Yuko is gone Billy is hoisted to
his feet Here comes round two Meanwhile --

She quints Across the street Sarah sees

VISIBLE THROUGH THE SECOND STORY WINDOW is Billy’s head --
being slammed against the glass

Sarah gasps Turns off the recorder

INT BAR - SECOND STORY — SAME

It’s ugly Billy is being badly beaten He occasionally
(barely) gets a karate move to work but without much effect

Suddenly they just HOLD Billy He looks as a door opens and--

Punchperm is walking toward him carrying a pair of BOLT
CUTTERS a malevolent look on his face

Billy gulps Punchperm indicates for Billy to hold out his
hand Crewcut and Sunglasses force him to do so

BILLY
Don’t -- seriously -- what are you --

And then Punchperm’s phone rings

And everything stops Punchperm hands the bolt cutter to
Blondie and reaches into his pocket and flips it open

PUNCHPERM
Moshi

Punchperm motions for a pen but no one has one He takes it
from Billy’s shirt Motions for paper -- but again no one
has any He waves it off and writes something on his
(bandaged) hand and then hangs up

Motions back for the bolt-cutters in a hurry now

He points to Billy’s hand Which Billy tries to clench in a
fist They pry back a finger The bolt cutter comes down

BILLY
No Seriously -- that’s my drawing
hand NO

and there’s a WHIRRING SOUND and someone YELLING IN
JAPANESE Punchperm stops People turn to see

Sarah by the door with the FINGER in one hand and a plugged-
in BLENDER in the other She looks like she means business

SARAH
(subtitled)
Release him or I will drop this in

PUNCHPERM
Do that and I’11 take his hand
52207 45

SARAH
(firm)
Take both You still won’t get this
back

BILLY
Um what are you guys talking about

They ignore him It’s a standoff Sarah holds it closer

SARAH
Clock’s ticking

Punchperm relents Speaks Japanese They let Billy go
BILLY
Thank you Thank you Whatever you
said thank you

Billy starts across the room to Sarah when --

Someone opens the door bumping into Sarah and causing her to

accidentally drop the finger into the whirring blender

Everything stops And everyone turns to the pink puree on
the inside of the glass Sarah flicks it off it whirs down

SARAH
Oops

And Billy thinks fast He reflexively KICKS THE GUY AT THE
DOOR -- who tumbles back down the stairs He shoves Sarah
out the door grabs the FIRE EXTINGUISHER off the wall and --

WHAM - WHAM - WHAM Billy slams three guys then turns and
still holding the fire extinguisher runs after Sarah as --

He reaches into his pocket and pulls out A SEVERED HAND
With a bandage where the finger used to be

SARAH
What the hell did you do

With two fingers he drops it into the ice bucket (like Woody
Allen with the lobster in Annie Hall) -- and slams the lid

BILLY
You gave me the sword

SARAH
But I didn’t expect you to cut off
some guy’s hand with it

BILLY
This is so you You give me notes but

Are you okay

Billy realizes that Sarah is BRUISED And woozy

The NIGHT MANAGER is standing with Blondie He’s searching
through keys (As always bolded dialogue is subtitled)

NIGHT MANAGER
I’m sorry I need to open a moment

He unlocks and opens the door -- which slams into the CHAIN
They peer through the slit And see
52207 49

INT LOVE MOTEL ROOM — SAME - VIEW FROM HALL

It looks as if two people are MAKING LOVE under the covers

UNDER THE COVERS - SAME

Billy lies on top of Sarah very close under the blanket
He is moving so as to appear to be having sex

She stares at him furious and terrified

NIGHT MANAGER (0S)
Somebody wants to speak to you

They are silent Billy looks imploringly at Sarah Sarah
speaks in a FLAWLESS JAPANESE ACCENT

SARAH
Please Do not tell our husbands

IN THE HALLWAY
Blondie looks at the Night Manager

BLONDIE
Husbands

The Night Manager shrugs Now Sarah speaks in a DIFFERENT
second Japanese voice

SARAH (0S)
You must promise to protect our
privacy Will you
Blondie looks back into the room A pause then

BLONDIE
Sorry ladies

The door is closed

INT ROOM CONTINUOUS
Sarah throws the sheet off Billy is still on top of her

BILLY
For the record That - the two lesbo
voices - coupled with the thing with
the blender Kind of hot
52207 50

SARAH

(pushes him away)
Get off me This Billy Chaka
adventure-slash-nightmare is now
officially over Were going to the
police And don’t worry well go
high enough up in the department that
this issue can be handled discreetly

(pause)
Do you hear me Repeat after me
It’s over

BILLY
I hear you I get it I know

There’s silence Though he knows she’s right there’s a part
of him which is sort of disappointed And we CUT TO
INT TOKYO POLICE STATION - A LITTLE WHILE LATER

Wee hours of the night Billy and Sarah wait (with the new
ice bucket) impatient and anxious as

Tetsuo arrives from the back Sarah and Billy rise

TETSUO
I received your message Unfortunately
my boss is very busy -- something

personal involving his boss It would
be inappropriate for me to interrupt

SARAH
I’m sure once he hears what it is he
will understand This is urgent

BILLY
We promise you won’t be embarrassed
(then)
And after by the way I had some
ideas for your “Tetsuo Tiger” thing

INT A LARGE BACK AREA (THE INNER OFFICES) - A MOMENT LATER
Tetsuo leads them back and motions to some chairs
TETSUO
Hes in his office Sit here Ill be
right back
Tetsuo crosses to an inner office about 10 yards away where

within through the window we see a MAN with his back to us
Billy points to the words on the door
52207 51

BILLY
What does that say

SARAH
Superintendent-General

Through the glass we see Tetsuo enter respectfully and speak
to the man who partially turns

And Billy and Sarah freak Because the man is NAGAO
BILLY SARAH

Holy shit Oh God

WITH TETSUO AND NAGAO - A MOMENT LATER

They step from the office to find Nobody Anywhere

Nagao looks at Tetsuo And lashes into him Tetsuo nods

bows extremely apologetic And we CUT TO

EXT STREETS OF TOKYO - NIGHT - SAME

Billy and Sarah hoof it from the station turn a corner

SARAH
This way

« and duck through a gate into --

INT NOODLE PALACE - CONTINUOUS
They hurry in and dive into a corner booth out of breath

BILLY
Okay Is there any part of this -- at
all -- that we might look at later and
find funny

SARAH
(instantly)
No
BILLY
Not even--
SARAH
No

A WAITRESS starts over Sarah speaks Japanese
52207

SARAH
Were not ready Thank you
(turns to Billy)
You realize that if Tetsuo’s boss is the
Superintendent-General that puts
Tetsuo’s boss’s boss somewhere very high
up in the National Safety Commission

BILLY
I don’t follow

SARAH
The man who came into your hotel room -
- that guy -- said that it was his
bosss daughter who you absconded with

BILLY
I didn’t --

SARAH
Just Let Me Finish

BILLY
And by the way it would be whom I
think at this point --
(off Sarah’s glare)
Okay Whatever

SARAH
(a beat then)
Please don’t tell me your little
girlfriend is the daughter of Hideki
Mitsui

The look on Billy’s face says it all

BILLY
Is that bad

SARAH
That’s the guy that’s gonna chop you
up into pieces if you don’t return his
daughter

BILLY
You know who he is

There’s a pause then Sarah just starts laughing

BILLY
What
52207 53

SARAH
It’s genius really You’re like
the Mozart of unmitigated disaster

BILLY
So you know him

Sarah becomes giddy But not a joyful giddiness no this
more a terrified-adrenalized-lack of sleep giddiness

SARAH

Ive heard of him And guess what
Hell do it That’s hilarious He will
chop us up and put pieces on every
island And then maybe the Tailor of
Taegu can sew us back together This
could be my last night with Billy Chaka
My last night on earth with his
little tape recorder and a bucket with a
hand in it I don’t know why this is so
funny I just

(sobers )
You are so fucked HA

BILLY
Why is this so funny to you

SARAH
How on Gods earth do you want me to
be Can you for once not think with
your little head What is it about
her She’s like some dangerous-sexy
uber-Chaka fantasy vixen You have
one task stay in your room Can you
perform this task Of course not
Youre like the greyhound chasing the
little rabbit Except it’s not a
rabbit It’s a fantasy rabbit

BILLY
You don’t know her

SARAH
Oh come on Billy Tell me one thing
about her Which I bet you can’t -
because I’m sure all she did was talk
about you

BILLY
She’s really special She seems to
know me

SARAH

Give me a break
BILLY

52207

She had a really tough childhood She

used to read Billy Chaka books --

SARAH
Great

BILLY
She’s in trouble

SARAH
Youre in trouble And you have

somehow managed to put yourself into

the one spot where you can’t go to the

police you can’t go to her
father you have the mob after
you you can’t

(pauses)
You have no moves

BILLY
We can find her

SARAH
Oh please

BILLY

What is it It’s like three-thirty

We have three hours

SARAH
No No

BILLY
We have an address

Billy opens the ice bucket Removes the HAND

SARAH
Put that away

Some people look across the restaurant Billy “casually”
waves with the hand as if it’s his own They wave back
Billy scratches his own head with it forces a smile

Finally after the people go back to eating

BILLY

The guy -- with the what’s it called

the “punchperm” haircut -- he got a
phone call an urgent call And he
wrote something

(shows her the hand)
On his hand This Tell me where
this is
52207

Sarah just look at him

SARAH
How come you never ask me any
questions

BILLY
What

SARAH
About me How come you never ask -
about me

BILLY
Where is this coming from

SARAH
What’s my favorite color What books
am I reading Do I have brothers
Sisters

BILLY
I swear to you Sarah I don’t know
what this has anything to do with --

SARAH
It has everything to do with this
It’s the reason we’re in this mess

There’s a pause

SARAH
She doesn’t know you She just bought
into the you you wanted her to see
The you you think everyone sees You
think I’m wrong

Sarah stands

BILLY
Where are you going
SARAH
Its in the warehouse district
BILLY

SARAH

The address On the hand It’s a
cargo bay At Tokyo Harbor

(off Billy’s look)
Come on Billy lLet’s go find your
fantasy girl
52207 56

And Sarah’s gone Billy hesitates Picks up the bucket
And follows

INT TAXI - NIGHT — DRIVING

Silent Billy looking at Sarah just looking at her

EXT TOKYO HARBOR — NIGHT

They exit the cab on a bluff-overlooking the Harbor

BILLY
Ask him to stay And keep the meter
running

SARAH

(to driver)
Please wait We’1ll be right back
(to Billy)
It’s down there There’s a view from
over there

DOWN THE HILL A WAYS
They kneel by a ledge

BILLY
It’s a bit far away

SARAH
Use this

From her purse she hands him a CAMERA with a LONG LENS

SARAH
It’s a three hundred millimeter zoom
with night vision

BILLY
What are you in the Secret Service

SARAH
I’m a hobbyist

BILLY
(surprised)
You’re a photographer

SARAH
Let’s just say I didn’t start off
editing coffee table books about
kittens dangling from chin-up bars
(MORE)
52207 57
SARAH (contd)
(points)
There’s something going on

DOWN BELOW - BY ONE OF THE CARGO BAYS - there’s some
activity Billy lifts the camera looks through it

CLOSER - BILLY’S POV - THROUGH THE LENS There’s movement —
people scurry secretive Billy sees some JAPANESE PHRASING

BILLY
What’s kokka anzen hosho kaigi

SARAH
National Security Commission It’s a
storage bay

BILLY
Why isn’t there more security
(sees something)
There is There’s a guy -- but he
seems to be helping them

Billy sees a MAN -- we’ll call him “THE MOLE” -- furtively
glance about as he waves a VEHICLE over

BILLY
Oh my God It’s the van THAT van

Down below that black van pulls up Billy rises starts to
scramble down the hill

BILLY
Stay here I’m gonna go closer and
take some pictures --

SARAH
No

BILLY
Yes yes yes We’ll give em to Mitsui
This is gonna save us

SARAH
NO Billy --

Suddenly Billy and Sarah both dive to the ground as way
below people turn hearing her voice Billy looks up

BILLY
Shhhhhhhhbh

When the men below return to their business he scrambles
further down Darts to the side and climbs the side of a
nearby STORAGE BIN He raises the camera as --
52207 58

CLOSER - SEEN THROUGH CAMERA LENS

The “Mole” holds a door open as a SILVER SUITCASE is taken
from the bay and carried into the van

’ REVERSE ANGLE

Billy crouched on the container watches as some MEN follow
the suitcase into the van He raises the camera and--

FROM A WIDE SHOT - there’s a bright highly visible FLASH
from on top of the cargo container as --

BILLY’S FACE falls while the light dims around him

BILLY
Whoops

Billy backpedals spins as below him people turn and point
He leaps off the bin and slams to the ground runs and --

Turns a corner Starts to scramble back to --

THE HILL

Where he barrels up through the grass huffing and puffing
He gets to where he last left Sarah -- but it’s just a
matted flat space in the grass

BILLY
Sarah Sarah

He turns keeps going Up up finally onto --

THE STREET
To find the taxi gone

BILLY
Sarah

Shes nowhere to be seen Suddenly ——

Billy hears HIS OWN VOICE Tinny and thin as if coming out
of a small speaker about 30 yards away He turns It’s
coming from the darkness down the street

BILLY’S SMALL VOICE (ON RECORDER)
WHOOSH - CRACK -- with a helicopter
kick so fast Chaka actually levitated--
52207 59

He starts walking following the sound of his own voice
until in the darkness the even darker form of a LIMOUSINE
starts to take shape Along with the shapes of

Crewcut and Sunglasses who are holding Sarah And Blondie
who holds Billy’s recorder grinning

BILLYS VOICE (ON RECORDER)
-- WHAM WHAM WHAM WHAM One by one--

Blondie turns it off Translates for Sunglasses They have
a good laugh

BILLY
It’s you know it’s rough draft
stuff

Crewcut takes the camera snaps a photo of Billy Then
Sunglasses raises a gun

BILLY SARAH
What are you DOING HEY NO

PUNCHPERM (0S)
(stops them)
Not yet

And now PUNCHPERM steps from the shadows -- cradling the ice
bucket in an arm which now ends in a BANDAGED STUMP He
grins and with his good hand he makes a “snipping” motion

INT LIMOUSINE - A MOMENT LATER

CLICK -- Billy’s handcuffed to Sarah who is handcuffed to
the HANDLE ABOVE THE DOOR (So now Billy’s cuffed to Sarah
and Sarah’s cuffed to the car)

Crewcut and Sunglasses get into the front on the other side
of the partition Punchperm and Blondie sit in the back
facing Billy and Sarah The limo starts moving

SARAH
So This turned out well
(to the front in Japanese)
Where are we going

There’s no response Sarah sighs leans back

BILLY
(quietly)
Maybe they’re taking us to Lee Jay
Yoon
52207 60

SARAH
Let’s hope not

‘EXT HILLSIDE - A FEW MINUTES LATER

The limo heads into a desolate section above the Meguro
River Tokyo looms in the distance

INT LIMOUSINE - SAME

Sarah is silent The menconfer through the partition window
in Japanese Billy leans over quietly to Sarah

BILLY
What are they talking about
SARAH
Something about awakening a sleeping
dragon
BILLY
Dragon -- like patchwork dragon
She glares at him to indicate “shut up - I’m

disten Billy nods indicates “what are they saying”

SARAH
Now theyre saying Yuko’s just down
river at Lee’s river house Anda
suitcase just arrived And theyre
saying something about “hurry up with
their ‘business’ and get over there”

BILLY
The “business” being

SARAH
They want to “see how many pieces they
can cut off him before he gives up and
dies”

BILLY
“Him” meaning me
(off Sarah’s nod)
No chance you misinterpreted that

SARAH
You mean like maybe the word for
“dismember” also means “give back rub
to”

Suddenly Punchperm turns Speaks Japanese directly at Sarah

52207 61

SARAH
Now he’s asking me point blank if I
speak Japanese

Sarah nods Punchperm nods impressed Then turns back to
his colleagues and resumes speaking

BILLY
Now what’s he saying

SARAH
I don’t know I don’t speak Korean

Billy listens a beat then turns to Sarah

BILLY
Hablamos Espanol

SARAH
What

BILLY

(stilted and slow)
Si elles hablamas Ingles y Korean
entonces nosotros hablamos Espanol

Sarah turns And unleashes a torrent of rapid-fire Spanish

SARAH

Imbécil Billy No puedo creer que
estoy en esta situacién Tienes toda

la culpa y juro a didéds que si nos
morimos por eso te sacaré la mugre

BILLY
Um no comprendo

Sarah rolls her eyes

BILLY
What I took it in high school for
like two years Only

The car turns again It’s now going down a DIRT ROAD
Sarah scared takes Billy’s hand -

SARAH
Does Billy Chaka like rum sensei

BILLY
What are you doing

SARAH
Rum Mr Karate-man
52207 62

BILLY
Sarah I don’t -- Oh

He notices that Sarah -- her feet bare -- has been using her
toes to SECRETLY PUSH IN THE CIGARETTE LIGHTER

Then he notices LIQUOR BOTTLES lining the sides of the limo

BILLY
Oh Yes Love a good flambe

Billy surreptitiously slips off his shoes And
Wraps his toes around two LIQUOR BOTTLES in the side well
Sarah removes the cigarette lighter with her toes as --

Billy grabs the bottle of rum with his right foot and a
second bottle with his left Then

As Punchperm and Blondie TURN BACK FROM THE FRONT --

Billy hoists himself up the liquor bottles in each foot and
smashes them together does a quick scissor kick and

With one foot he dumps RUM on Punchperm With the other he
JAMS Blondie’s neck Punchperm tries to remove his gun --

BILLY
Lighter Now

Sarah gasps and thrusts the lighter onto Punchperm’s rum-
soaked suit and he is ignited He yells as Billy KICKS THE
GUN from his hand Then kicks Blondie in the head -- hard --
knocking him unconscious Then does the same to Punchperm
BILLY
(incredulous and frantic)
Ah Ah ah ah ah

The limo lurches to a sudden stop on the side of the road

INTEXT LIMO - HILLSIDE FACING DOWN - CONTINUOUS
Billy scrambles over Sarah throws the door open

BILLY
Now - run

SARAH
I can’t --

Billy darts out and is instantly yanked back--
52207 63

SARAHBILLY
OW Ahhh

-- because Sarah’s other hand is still handcuffed to the car

BILLY
Oh Crap I forgot

Now Crewcut and Sunglasses come around the front of the limo
guns drawn Only an OPEN DOOR separates them from

Billy handcuffed to Sarah who is handcuffed to the car

BILLY
DIVE

Billy plows Sarah behind the open door which is
disintegrating as the men FIRE and blow CHUNKS OF METAL and
SHATTERED GLASS everywhere BLAM BLAM BLAM

BILLY
Glass Use the glass

Sarah flails glass at Crewcut temporarily blinding him
Billy wings a shard of metal like a shuriken (throwing star)
at Sunglasses’s neck He falls gun sliding under the car

BILLY
(amazed)
That totally worked

SARAH
BILLY

She points to Crewcut whos recovering Billy scissor-kicks
his legs -- and he falls And sees the GUN under the car
At the same time that Billy does And now

It’s a race Billy scrambles under the car trying to reach
it He’s ahead of the guy but because he’s cuffed to
Sarah he can’t make it -He’s stopped inches from it

BILLY
Oh come ON

Crewcut smiles at Billy Starts shimmying toward the gun

Billy gets an idea and quickly slides back out Climbs over
Sarah and dives back into the car

SARAH
What are you doing
52207 64

He bounds toward the partition climbs over the writhing
Blondie who is moaning opening his eyes Billy slugs him
twice and karate chops him Blondie’s out again

Under the car Crewcut gets the gun Starts inching out
Inside Billy flips around thrusts his FEET through the
partition and DISENGAGES THE PARKING BRAKE with his toe
And because they’re on a fairly steep hill

The LIMO STARTS ROLLING FORWARD

Just as Crewcut has almost shimmied out

And the car rolls Onto his leq He yells The gun drops
from his hands Inside --

Billy hurls Punchperm out onto the street Then Blondie
Then he pushes and pushes trying to rock the car We
hear GROANING below as finally it ROLLS FORWARD We
hear a SCRAPING SOUND -- like metal on concrete

Billy sees the BUCKET Takes Punchperm’s hand out of it

SARAH
What are you doing

BILLY
Just I feel bad

He leans out the door to toss the hand to Punchperm when
We see the source of the scraping sound it’s the CAR DOOR
bent on the hinges and dragging its sharp metal corner along
the pavement right at

Punchperm’s arm Which it summarily severs at the elbow

BILLY
Ooh

He looks at the hand Shrugs Tosses it anyhow

SARAH
Billy

BILLY
What OH SHIT

The car is PICKING UP SPEED And it’s DOWNHILL pointed
straight toward a bluff over a river

He dives through the partition tries to reach forward
52207 65

BILLY
I can’t reach the brakes -- wait

He backs up and scrambles over her and dives out of the now-
moving car--

SARAH
What are you doing

Billy stretches to grab Sunglasses’s foot as they pass and

EXT STREETINI LIMO - NIGHT - ROLLING DOWN THE HILL

As the limo gains speed Billy pulls him toward him as he
grapples for the guy’s pocket and

BILLY
The key

As the car heads faster toward the river -- Billy removes a
KEY from his pocket drops him and he rolls

BILLY
Pull me in

With a great effort (and the car still gaining speed) Sarah
pulls him in as Billy tries the key in her cuff

SARAH

Hurry
BILLY

I’m trying It’s too bouncy

He gets the key in But it doesn’t work

BILLY

Its the wrong key
SARAH

(re approaching cliff)

Billy

Billy tries the handcuff attaching him to her -- and IT
WORKS The car’s speeding for the edge

BILLY
See ya
(before she can respond)
Kidding Kidding

Billy DIVES THROUGH THE PARTITION and CRANKS THE WHEEL and —-
52207 66

The limo screeches sideways and SLAMS INTO A BRIDGE SUPPORT
POLE Billy slams into the dash Sarah still cuffed to the
handle over the door is yanked forward
SARAH
Ahh
INT LIMOEXT BLUFF - CONTINUING
The car though stopped is perched precariously on the edge

BILLY
Hang on Don’t move

Billy pops the trunk button scrambles over Sarah and bolts
out Grabs a tire iron

The car starts to list tips steeper Sarah is against the
DOWNHILL DOOR as Billy comes gingerly back in

SARAH
Billy

BILLY
Come toward me Slowly

Trying not to upset the delicate balance Billy wedges the
crow bar and slowly pries the handle Slowly slowly and--

BILLY
I got it

He did Sarah’s arm’s free Billy sighs Looks at her
Tosses the crow bar out the opening then sees something

On the floor are his SKETCH BOOK and RECORDER He brightens

BILLY
Hey

And reaches down and grabs them

which is exactly the thing that throws off the balance
AND NOW THE LIMO TIPS And knocks BOTH of them --

Forward against the downhill door Which ROCKS the car
further fatally and NOW THE CAR BEGINS MOVING DOWN

They scramble FRANTICALLY AGAINST THE MOMENTUM OF THE CAR

BILLY
Hang on

Billy PUNCHES OPEN THE UPHILL WINDOW and RECUFFS SARAHS HAND --—

52207 67

SARAH
What are you DOING

And PULLS HER ARM THROUGH and LATCHES IT ONTO SOMETHING as --

BILLY
I don’t know

-- THE ENTIRE CAR SLIDES PAST THEM leaving

EXT CLIFF OVER RIVER — NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

SARAH HANDCUFFED TO A SEWER POLE and --

Billy holding onto her trying desperately to climb UP her
Far below the car crashes into the river

SARAH
Oh my God Oh my God Oh my God

BILLY
Hang on can you swing

They start swinging back and forth and

Finally Billy gets a foothold They pull themselves up the
cloud-encircled skyline of Tokyo across the river from them

EXT HILLSIDE ABOVE RIVER - A FEW MINUTES LATER

Billy and Sarah are now up the hill near the felled men and
the glass and metal Billy tries to unlock Sarahs cuff but
his hands are shaking too much Finally

SARAH
Here Let me

She unlocks the cuff hands it to Billy

BILLY

I’m gonna be honest Despite what you
might think I’ve never really used my
karate except you know on mats
in the dojo I’m I have to sit
down

(rubbing his jaw)
For the record It’s super different
when they don’t wear pads

Sarah sits by him picks some broken glass from his face
52207 68

BILLY
Kinda weirdly “Chaka-esque” no

SARAH
Only in the sense that none of it
makes sense
(off Billy’s look)

I don’t mean to snap -- I‘m just --
I’m terrified to be honest
(then)

My shoes are down there In the car
They‘re Lanvin flats
(rises)
I need to call legal
(swoons )
I need to sit down

She sways more Billy rises grabs her Steadies her

SARAH
I’m sorry I’m

They’re just standing there above the river Tokyo looming
across the other bank Billy holds her gazes down at her
motionless as if frozen in a “dip” during a ballroom dance

And he just stares at her at her skin so soft so
human so beautiful

And he kisses her Briefly

Pause Then she kisses him back For a while It gets
quite heavy And then

They both pull away Look at each other Another pause

SARAH
Okay In all those crannies and
nooks in the Billy Chaka brain where
was this stored

BILLY

I don’t know what you mean
SARAH

How much of that was nerves and

stress
They size each other up Guarded

BILLY
Well I don’t know Cause I mean if
you’re like thinking that was a
mistake
52207 69

SARAH
All I’m saying is I certainly am
nervous and stressed

BILLY
I don’t blame you I am too

Sarah nods If not physically Billy is certainly retreating
emotionally She does the same

SARAH
So Where do we go from here

BILLY
I think to the river house

Billy notices a slight chill pass through Sarah

BILLY
Wait -- is that what you meant
SARAH
(dissembling)
Yes
BILLY

Cause if you meant something else --
SARAH
That’s what I meant
DOWN BY THE RIVER —- A MOMENT LATER
Below the cliff they move by the bank Toward a little
SKIFF which is tied up on a little dock There’s a mist
which clings to the river Billy unties the skiff
BILLY
See that’s what I love about this
country In America this would be
chained to

He sees Sarah’s distant look Quiets

A MOMENT LATER — ON THE RIVER

Billy and Sarah glide silently along the misty river
Nothing to say No words For the first time

They float drifting rudderless

Gradually they hear some sounds muffled male voices low
tones Billy indicates something
52207 70

UP AHEAD the shadowy silhouetted form of a BOATHOUSE looms

Billy and

Sarah both duck low as Billy guides the skiff past

around a bend and up into a secluded eddy

EXT BANKS OF RIVER —- BIG LAWN

Billyand Sarah slip bare-footed through trees and onto a
big dark mist-covered lawn which leads up toward an ESTATE
which looms silhouetted up the hill On the roof is an odd
SHAPE -- bird-like with large antennae it’s a HELICOPTER

Billy notices Sarah has slowed He turns

He starts

BILLY
What

SARAH
You know you don’t just do that

BILLY
Do what Please don’t tell me you
want to talk about this right now

SARAH
I agree You’re right I don’t

BILLY
Good

away Then comes back

BILLY
But you don’t agree Youre just
saying that to end the conversation

SARAH
So what You actually want to have
this conversation

BILLY
Yes I do
SARAH
Right here Right now
BILLY
Yes
SARAH

Fine For two years -—
52207 71

BILLY
(suddenly distracted)
Oh my God It’s her

He points uphill toward the upstairs window of the mansion
where guards bring someone with long dark hair into a room

BILLY
Sarah
Sarah turns -- but then Billy sees something moving nearby
And he quickly shoves Sarah behind a clump of bushes
BILLY
(whispering)

Theres guards right over there
Through trees a couple MEN patrol Sarah stares at Billy

BILLY
We have to get around back I think I
see a way in

SARAH
You know what it is I’ve been
holding onto an idea of you I’m
like the ultimate Billy Chaka

BILLY
What

SARAH
This whole time I thought you were the
one blindly pursuing some vanishing
fantasy It was me

BILLY
Do you understand how this isn’t even
close to the right time to have this
conversation

SARAH
What did I think I was going to mold
you into anyway

BILLY
(something catches his eye)
Those men What are they saying

They see a guard removing a cell phone Sarah listens

SARAH
They’re gonna call the guys from the
limo They want to know why they
haven‘t arrived yet
52207 72

BILLY

We have to move

SARAH

I’m quitting

What

BILLY

SARAH

Edit yourself Billy Better yet get
Yuko to edit You said she knows you

Okay

BILLY
Now I see where this is coming
Where are you —-

Sarah starts down toward the water Billy stage whispers --

Sarah

BILLY
Youll get us caught--

Suddenly there’s a RINGING Sarah turns -- sees Billy trying
to figure out its source

She points to his POCKET which GLOWS And Billy removes

-» a RINGING CELL PHONE -- which he quickly hangs up

SARAH

You took one of their cell phones

BILLY

You wanted to call legal --

SARAH

Why didn’t you say you had it

BILLY

It got weird You kissed me --

I
e)
Is

t

SARAH

kissed me first

BILLY

ou kissed me harder

Suddenly VOICES are heard as the MEN start uphill

WITH THE MEN

One hits “redial” They then hear
52207 73

A distant ringing phone - which suddenly gets closer as -
WHACK - it hits one of them in the head as -—-

BILLY AND SARAH

Run -- now away from the guards and toward the main house
SARAH
So -- cell phone flashing camera --

they teach you that in ninja school

BILLY
Ha ha Quiet
(grabs her)
This way There’s no turning back
(quickly )
And I’m not talking about us

He turns -- and she slugs him in the gut
BILLY
Ooomph Jesus what was that
SARAH
You’re an asshole That’s what that

was Go

She shoves him and they both move into --

INT MAIN HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
Where they enter a KITCHEN Billy locks the door

BILLY
They don’t know it’s us yet Quick --
how do we get upstairs

Billy peers around the corner

IN THE LIVING ROOM

Two mobsters watch tv With TWO GUNS on the table behind
them And -- past them -- in another room -- the suitcase
partially seen through a cracked-open door

BILLY
If I take one gun and throw you the
other will you point it at those guys
and tell them to be quiet
(off her hesitation)
Or I can just go by myself with both
guns and leave you here Your call
52207 74

SARAH
Toss me the gun

BILLY
Can you catch
(off her glare)
Okay okay This’ll work - Trust me

Billy darts in grabs the first gun turns and tosses it
WAY over her head and CRASHING through the window

SARAH

for a moment until he realizes --

He’s dangling over a balcony -- on which are standing TWO
GUARDS their backs to him looking in through a glass door

But they see his reflection So he KICKS them through the
glass then struggles up onto the roof as

There was a LIGHTED CANDLE on the desk Which has now fallen
directly under a HANGING CURTAIN which ignites

Billy fires THREE SHOTS at the long bedpost -- and reels from
each successive kickback The bedpost splinters off and --

Yuko rises -- a 12 inch piece of bedpost cuffed to her wrist

INTO THE HOUSE

And goes right past the (surprised) guards as he pushes
through smoke and winds through the living room and into

The den where he yanks THE SUITCASE from a guard and
spins SLAMMING HIM IN THE HEAD and then

Races back through the living room (passing guards) and out -
52207 80
ACROSS THE MISTY LAWN

Away from the now-flaming house Suddenly theres the sound
of RUMBLING and Billy turns to see --

The HELICOPTER RISING FROM THE ROOF and arcing up over the
trees scattering smoke and mist Shouts and GUNSHOTS ring
out but it’s too cloudy to get a clear view

SARAH (0S)
This way Billy Billy

He spins follows Sarah’s voice in the mist and races toward--
A BOAT HOUSE

-which houses dinghies a speedboat and a GAS PUMP Sarah
and Yuko are untying the speedboat

SARAH

keys hanging on a nail

BILLY

KICKBACK and the roar of the boat sending Billy flying
backwards again So he doesn’t get to see it as -- WHOOSH -

The gas pump catches fire Guards scream and dive into the
water and --— KABOOOQOOOM --

The entire place explodes Flame and debris spray into the
air as a dinghy ROCKETS OUT skipping across the water like a
flat rock right towards them as-—-

Billy pushes the women to the floor as the dinghy slices over
their heads and sails past

Slowly the three peek over the boat’s edge to see the
scattered piles of burning wreckage Sarah hits the gas
again and the boat roars into the fog And we CUT TO

But it’s funny -- this time I really did
think it was over and

His smile drops He just kinda nods Nagao nods along

NAGAO

There’s a kind of a long pause where the car just drives
and Billy just thinks trying to put this all together

You will need to either locate the
person with the remote and kill him
from behind -- I presume you are
familiar with all the non-spasming
instant death impact points

BILLY
--Sure

LEE
Or you will need to find the bomb
itself and remove it A bigger risk
as you could blow up with it

Billy’s cummerbund is latched Punchperm holds up Billys
tie -- but he can’t tie it with one hand

BILLY
Ill I‘1l get that one

He takes it Lee hands him his jacket Billy slides it on

As the copter above him veers right and then left
trying to avoid the rapidly gaining police helicopters --
BILLY

Flies along just above traffic barely missing trucks
“running” along the roofs of cars as he skips like a stone at
60 miles an hour and RISES AGAIN and is now --

Swung with wild centrifugal force -- nearly missing buildings
-- including AN ENTIRE WALL-SIZED VIDEO AD FOR THE TOKYO
SUCKERPUNCH MOVIE -- showing DOLPH LUNDGREN KICKING MAJOR ASS
as the JAPANESE WRITING explodes onto screen followed by the
English phrase TODAY AT 12 - BILLY CHAKA WILL SAVE TOKYO

Beneath it at a MOVIE THEATER people are LINED UP AROUND
THE BLOCK to see the film

Billy soars right over them -- no one even noticing -- as a
giant CLOCK reads 1143232425 And then

QUICK SHOTS - ROARING THROUGH THE SKIES OVER TOKYO

ONE OF THE POLICE HELICOPTERS fires on--

LEE’S COPTER which arcs hit followed by
52207 103

BILLY who continues to arc up then is pulled in the
opposite direction as the helicopter starts dropping and
now as the helicopter tips even further

PUNCHPERM falls through the open door and passes Billy
eyeing him directly as --

—- WWHHHHHHHHHICK -- his entire arm is sliced at the shoulder
by the rotor blade Billy winces but then notices that --

The BLADE still spinning and coming closer to Billy as it
JUST MISSES BILLY but it slices the cord and --

BILLY is flung horizontally right toward A BUILDING as --

INT BUILDING - SAME

holding it right where his real face is

Some TEENAGERS spot him Yell Billy rises Starts to run

which pixelate him like a cartoon For a brief instant Billy

looks like a character in his own anime Finally --

The train recedes and Billy looks back confused for a

He turns back as Yuko eyes him warily and

EXT TOYA BUILDING - BACK - SAME

Billy rushes around back still scanning And stops
Sees CATERING VEHICLES COSTUME TRUCKS

And a WAIT STAFF -- people in “Billy Chaka”-themed costumes
there are DragonFlys Billys mobsters and ALL all have
HUGE (4 FOOT TALL) EXAGGERATED PAPIER-MACHE CHARACTER HEADS
Then Billy notices a waiter taking off a huge “BILLY CHAKA
HEAD” so he can fit inside a PORTA-POTTY Meanwhile --

INT BUILDING - SAME

Miyashiro extends a hand to Sarah and Dolph

MIYASHIRO
This way please

They rise as he leads them toward a podium at the front

EXT BACK OF BUILDING

The PORTA POTTY OPENS and the waiter comes out unable to
find his big Billy Chaka head That’s because

AT THE SERVERS’ ENTRANCE

Among the ant-line of “Billy Chaka” waiters heading inside
with giant “Billy Chaka heads” ONE is moving incredibly
quickly -- with food sliding off his tray As they go in --

A boss yells out But this “Chaka” just bullets past as

INT BANQUET HALL —- PENTHOUSE - SAME

Billy in a huge “Billy Chaka Head” rushes in looks around
Immediately freezes as he sees across the room

SARAH AND DOLPH

At the podium waiting while the Prime Minister glad-hands
his way down the aisle half-way there

SARAH
Youll be fine Just let him bow --
then you bow just a bit lower like --

Something distracts her On the other side of the room
52207 111
A BIG HUGE BILLY CHAKA-HEAD
Is waving -- trying to give a signal to somebody

BIG HUGE “BILLY CHAKA HEAD”
Sarah move go shit

He sees Sarah at the other end of the room look for a
second then turn back to Dolph whose hand she still holds

The Billy Chaka Head sags and then stiffens as Billy sees

BILLY’S POV - THROUGH THE MESH BILLY CHAKA “SMILE”

ALONE ON THE BALCONY Nagao leans to get a better view of

THE PRIME MINISTER

Who is now a mere two people away from the podium He bows
to the first Moves to the next

ON THE BALCONY

Nagao reaches into his pocket with his gloved hand

DOWN BELOW

AT THE MITSUI TABLE Yuko watches as her father is one of the
only people NOT locking at the front of the room Instead
he is making eye contact with Nagao up on the balcony

She follows Nagao’s eyes down toward
The Prime Minister who now turns toward the podium
Sarah switches her mic on Taps it testing

SARAH
Um Why isn’t this working

She can’t seem to get it to go on as --

ON THE BALCONY
Nagao raises the DETONATOR And --

- WHAMMMMMM Somebody in a GIANT BILLY CHAKA HEAD dives
onto him and they topple
52207 112

The remote flies out of his hand and skitters to side
sliding along the floor And as --

DOWNSTAIRS
The Prime Minister begins speaking and --
SARAH
(whispers to Miyashiro)
My microphone isn’t working
UPSTAIRS

Billy -- still in his huge head -- rises and starts to
scramble -- but he is grabbed by Nagao And spun And --

—- WHACK -- Nagao slugs the Billy Chaka head -- which wobbles
back and forth like a bobble-head and then --

-- WHACK -- Nagao punches again and the head spins 90 degrees
sideways Now Billy can’t see He waves around blindly as
Nago SLUGS HIM again and Billy topples the head flying off

Nagao crosses the row and picks up the remote turns and --

--WHAMMM -- a huge flying empty Billy Chaka Head knocks him
off his feet He slams to the ground the remote only feet
from his grasp He reaches for it and --

Billy dives on top Slugs him Grabs the remote Lifts it
But Nagao grabs Billy’s throat Chokes him with one hand
while reaching for the remote with the other

Billy tries to keep it out of his reach
NAGAO

You’re an idiot Not only are your
prints on the detonator you’re at the

scene

BILLY
It’ll never work What’s my possible
motive

NAGAO

I’1ll give you a hint “Do you
understand that you have raped my
dreams”

BILLY
What
52207 113

Nagao slugs him The remote flies out of Billy’s hand and
right onto the lip of the balcony

Each man freezes feinting trying to trick the other and
then Billy looks down at

SARAH

Holding the black box with wires trying to make it work

ON THE BALCONY

Billy slowly turns eyes widening He glares at Nagao - who

smiles Then --

Billy lunges for the remote and gets a hand on it but --
Nagao slams into him and --

The two of them CRASH THROUGH THE RAILING as --

The remote is knocked from Billy’s hand and sails forward

shell-shocked as Sarah comes over kneels by him

52207 120

Billy tears open the wrapper and removes something wrapped
in NEWSPRINT As he peels the newsprint off we see the
front page of the JAPAN TIMES

He smiles as he sets it down It’s a HALF PAGE PHOTO of
DOLPH and TETSUO above mug shots of NAGAO and MITSUI And
the phrase “Billy Chaka and The Tetsuo Tiger Save Tokyo”

He shakes his head and rips off the rest of the paper to
reveal an ancient CASE He sets it on the coffee shop
table And carefully unlatches it And opens it

BILLY
Whoa

From it he gingerly removes the most amazing ANCIENT
JAPANESE SWORD he’s ever seen There’s note attached to it

Billy reads it Then hands it to his friend

EVAN
“For Billy Chaka We are most
grateful for your valiant efforts on
the part of our country”

DAN
So wait so you really
Billy shrugs -- humble -- and makes a non-committal gesture
BILLY

Bit You know whatever
‘And he replaces the sword in its case Takes Sarah’s arm

BILLY
Later luddites

The guys sit there silent watching as --

EXT COFFEE SHOP - MAGIC HOUR

Billy and Sarah leave the diner Billy slings the sword (in
its sheath) over his shoulder and linking arms with Sarah
the two of them walk off into the city And

As the setting sun throws Billy and Sarah into silhouette we
notice that for the briefest instant with the sword on his
back and Sarah’s trenchcoat billowing in the breeze

It looks very much as if Billy Chaka could have drawn it

THE END
