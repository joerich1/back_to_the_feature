VALLEGRANDE PROVINCE BOLIVIA EXT EARLY MORNING

30 JULY 1967

In a deep canyon beside a fast-flowing river about TWENTY MEN
are camped Bearded skinny strained Most are asleep in
attitudes of exhaustion One awake stares in despair at the

state of his boots Pack animals are tethered nearby

MORO Cuban thickly bearded clad in the ubiquitous fatigues
prepares coffee over a smoking fire

CHE GUEVARA Revolutionary Commandant and leader of this
expedition hunches wheezing over his journal - a cherry-
coloured plastic-covered agenda Unable to sleep CHE waits
for the coffee to relieve his ASTHMA CHE is bearded 39 years
old

A LIGHT flickers on the far side of the ravine

MORO
Shit A light --

ANGLE ON RAUL
A Bolivian picking up his M-1 rifle

RAUL

Incoming bullets whine through the camp

EVERYONE is awake and in a panic

ANGLE ON CHINO

Chinese-Peruvian round-faced and bespectacled roundingup the
frightened mounts OTHER MEN load the horses with supplies -
lashing them insecurely in their haste

Its getting light SOLDIERS of the Bolivian Army can be seen
across the ravine firing through the trees

POMBO leads CHEs horse away from the gunfire CHE asthma
worsening clutches the pommel gasping for breath

ANGLE ON THE HORSES

Crossing the river ONE MAN slips losing his pack He runs
forward Others seeing how much faster he runs abandon their
packs deliberately

ANGLE ON A GUERRILLA - RICARDO -

HIS POV -- TOTAL CONFUSION

The SOLDIERS advancing horses and men struggling in the water -
- a COMPLETE ROUT

FLASHBACK

ANTOFAGASTA DESERT CHILE EXT DAY

12 MARCH 1952

A single lane road winds through reddish-grey desert hills
devoid of all plant life The asphalt and the telegraph poles
are the only evidence of man

In the far distance a MOTORCYCLE appears

ANGLE ON CHE GUEVARA riding pillion He is 23 years old with a
shaved head which has earned him the nickname of El Pelado

The cycle a 1936 Garden Gate TT Norton is piloted by ALBERTO
GRANADOS 29 years old GRANADOS and CHE are Argentinians
young idealistic and well-fed

The motorcycle which emits strange noises has seen better
days

They approach us out of the fantastic desert landscape
The motorcycle dies
ROADSIDE EXT DAY

CHE hauls their rucksacks off the Norton ALBERTO considers
the oil-dripping engine with disgust

LATER
CHE sits beside the road ALBERTO tinkers with the motor

LATER
CHE kicks a stone ALBERTO continues tinkering swearing
to himself

STILL LATER
ALBERTO and CHE heave the defunct Motorcycle into a ditch
LATER STILL

They walk along the desert highway carrying their packs
ALBERTO checks a blister on his foot

The telegraph poles cast long shadows across the road
ANGLE ON A TRUCK

Approaching SEVERAL PEOPLE standing in the back

CHE and ALBERTO put out their thumbs

The TRUCK stops It is driven by a middle-aged MESTIZO wearing
a straw cowboy hat

The DRIVER shrugs
HIGHWAY EXT NIGHT

CHE and ALBERTO stand in the back of the pickup shivering
surrounded by silent INDIANS wrapped in warm ponchos and alpaca
hats

CHE
(to the INDIANS)
Cold isnt it

No answer

ALBERTO
I dont think they speak Spanish

CHE
Oh
(jumps up and down indicating
how cold it is)
COLD

The INDIANS do not reply CHE and ALBERTO huddle together for
warmth Both look sadly at the Cab

CHIQUICAMATA COPPER MINE EXT MORNING

A huge open-pit mine with many poorly-clad INDIAN WORKERS
Underground explosions can be heard WORKERS tip raw rock into
steaming reservoirs of Sulphuric Acid to extract the copper
OVERSEERS and POLICE look on

CHE and ALBERTO make their way across a catwalk to an office
A sign says BRADEN MINING CO

OFFICE INT MORNING

MR MACKEBOY the American Administrator of the Quiquicamata
Mine is seated behind his desk He stares at CHE and ALBERTO
in astonishment

MACKEBOY

the miners

MACKEBOY

MACKEBOY
He isnt here

ALBERTO
So you do need one You must have
daily fractures men with silicosis
symptoms from the sulfur fumes --

MACKEBOY

CATWALK EXT MORNING

CHE and ALBERTO walk back the way theyve come
CHE is in a fury

CHE

ALBERTO is already unfolding a map

ALBERTO
Want to try some place else

CHE
Thats the way it is with gringos
And they make lousy motorcycles
ALBERTO
What about Peru Bolivia

SILLUSTANI PERU EXT AFTERNOON

CHE and ALBERTO stare in wonderment at the Pre-Inca NECROPOLIS
of Sillustani - a series of imposing STONE TOWERS on the shore
of a lake

They are accompanied by an INDIAN GUIDE

GUIDE
This is the burial grounds of the
Great Incas In each CHULPA a
General is buried In the white
ones over there are the Priests

ALBERTO has his camera out CHE whispers to him

CHE
This isnt an Inca necropolis
This is Pre-Inca 2000 years old
at least

GUIDE
The Incas had the power to MELT STONE
They used a special herb to do it
There is a bird that uses the same
herb to melt a hole for its nest --

CHE
(whispering)
What a lot of bullshit They were
just good stonemasons

ALBERTO nods not listening He is powerfully impressed by the
strange atmosphere of the place
LAKE UMAYO SILLUSTANI EXT SUNSET

CHE strides purposefully along the banks of the lake surveying
the majestic BURIAL TOWERS
ALBERTO
Hey Pelado You know that little girl
we met last night in Puno Maria
Magdalena - if I married her since
shes a descendent of Manco Capac II
well Id be Manco Capac III And then
everyone would vote for me and I could
get Tupac Amarus revolution going
again - the INDO-AMERICAN REVOLUTION

CHE
Make the Revolution without firing a
shot Youre crazy

CHE stops Hes found a bottle on the shore of the Lake

CHE
Got any paper on you

ALBERTO produces his journal CHE tears a page out
ALBERTO
Careful Thats my journal

You should keep one of those

CHE writes ERNESTO GUEVARA DE LA SERNA and ALBERTO GRANADOS
on the paper and inserts it in the bottle

He places the bottle carefully beneath one of the Ancient
Stones

SAN PABLO LEPROSARIUM LORETO PERU INT DAY

CHE and ALBERTO are at work in the Lepers Clinic
ALBERTO is giving shots CHE is pulling teeth

PATIENT
You two are pretty brave Most
doctors are afraid to treat lepers

ALBERTO
Most cases of leprosy arent contagious
And anyway its a doctors duty to
treat everyone

ANGLE ON CHE

Breaking up coughing shoulders hunched gasping for breath
He clutches at his pockets looking for something --

PATIENT
Whats the matter with Doctor Guevara

ALBERTO
Hes asthmatic

PATIENT
My brother has asthma He must be
looking for his inhaler Here --

He jumps out of his chair and goes to CHEs coat - finds his
ASTHMATIC INHALER CHE sinks back into the PATIENTs chair and
gratefully inhales The attack subsides

PATIENT

This is the worst place for an
asthmatic - the Jungle

SAN PABLO LEPROSARIUM EXT EVENING

CHE and ALBERTO take their leave of the PATIENTS

It is an emotional moment Even the most severely disabled
patients - without legs arms - have turned out to see them off

There is even a small ORCHESTRA

CHE and ALBERTO stare astonished at a RAFT moored at the edge of
the Amazon JUNGLE all around

FEMALE PATIENT
We made this for you

CHE approaches the raft It bears a sign MAMBO TANGO
He looks back at his PATIENTS so overcome he cannot speak

CHE
Thank you

The ORCHESTRA begins to play as CHE and ALBERTO board the raft
The strains of a SAXAPHONE predominate

PATIENTS
Goodbye Doctors Vayan con Dios --

ANGLE ON THE RAFT

Moving off slowly vanishing from sight into the drizzle while
the sound of the ORCHESTRA and the CHOIR continues

FLASHFORWARD

via RAFT The River is in flood the crossing disastrous

ANGLE ON TWO MEN

Swept into the River One of them BRAULIO swims for the
bank The other CARLOS grabs for a pack on board the Raft
The pack falls into the River dragging him down

POMBO
The Rifles

Another wave sweeps over the Raft CHE and the GUERRILLAS cling
to it for dear life as more supplies are swept overboard

ANOTHER GUERRILLA watches in dismay She pulls her hat off
revealing shoulder-length brown hair She is TAMARA BUNKE -
TANIA
TANIA

That was the last of the supplies
FLASHBACK
GUATEMALA CITY EXT DAY
MARCH 1955
Banners supporting the Revolutionary Government of PRESIDENT

JACOBO ARBENZ GUZMAN adorn the modern Ministry of Health
Building Two Army Trucks are parked outside

ANGLE ON EL PATOJO - JULIO CACERES VALLE -

Younger smaller broader than CHE - very Guatemalan down to
his black fedora hat - waiting outside the building

CHE emerges furious

CHE
Bastards
(turns and shouts at Ministry
of Health Building)
IDIOTS ELITIST SCUM

PATOJO
Howd it go

CHE
They turned me down I am not FIT
to be a doctor in the service of
the Guatemalan Revolution

CHE storms off down the street PATOJO runs after him
PATOJO
But why
CHE

Because Im not a Communist

PATOJO
I thought you were a Communist

CHE
Yeah but Im not a Party Member ALL RIGHT

PATOJO
Oh Well why arent you

CHE
(fuming forcing himself
to calm down)
Listen Patojo The day that I decide
to join a Party itll be because I want
to not because someone tells me to

CHE bumps into a YOUNG SOLDIER on the corner

EL PATOJO pulls him hastily away

PATOJO
Watch out for those guys okay

CHE
Why They dont know how to shoot

PATOJO
Thats the problem with my countrys
army When they do shoot they cant
help but hit you

CHE laughs They walk on through a market filled with SOLDIERS
COPS and brilliantly-dressed INDIGENOUS PEOPLE

CHE
Im hungry
ARGENTINIAN EMBASSY EXT EVENING
Guards outside Lights within indicate a DIPLOMATIC SOIREE
ARGENTINIAN EMBASSY INT EVENING

A SUMPTUOUS BUFFET lines one wall of the large high-ceilinged
room Some of the GUESTS are extremely well-dressed obvious

diplomats and businessmen Others are somewhat down-at-heel

itinerant ARGENTINIANS the most stubbornly dilapidated is CHE
GUEVARA

CHE and EL PATOJO march down the long table of food Following
CHEs example PATOJO fills him mouth and lines his pockets with
as much food as possible

A liveried WAITER approaches with a bottle of Moet et Chandon

WAITER
Champagne Caballero

EL PATOJO reaches for the tray but CHE waves him away
CHE

The Revolutionary must be an ascetic
To the stoicism imposed by the difficult (CONT)

CHE (CONT )
conditions of warfare should be added
an austerity born of RIGID SELF-CONTROL
that will prevent a single excess a
single slip whatever the circumstances

PATOJO
Well why are we eating all this food

At the end of the buffet line HILDA GADEA - a short fiery
magnetic Peruvian - is arguing with TWO PERONISTS twice her
size She pauses glances at the MEN approaching filling
their pockets with food

CHE
Because the Revolutionary eats when he
can and everything he can Sometimes
fabulous feasts disappear in an instant
at other times he fasts for three or
four days without suffering ANY
diminution in his capacity for work

PATOJO
(mouth full of food)
Absolutely Couldnt agree more

CHE sees HILDA looking at him HILDA returns to her argument
embarrassed

HILDA
Of course a woman has a place in
politics She can perform any task
aman can and more besides She
has more feeling --

CHE
And more intelligence

HILDA and the PERONISTAS turn and look at CHE surprised

CHE
My own mother is a brilliant
political thinker Active in
politics since I was a boy
The Compafiera is absolutely right

The PERONISTAS take a fade HILDA looks CHE and EL PATOJO

up and down EL PATOJO tries to conceal the fact that his
pockets are full of cream cakes spare ribs and bread

HILDA
You look like you are far from home
Companeros

PATOJO
He is I live just round the corner --

HILDA
(ignoring EL PATOJO
looking straight at CHE)
Perhaps you could use a home-cooked
meal sometime
ANGLE ON CHE
He obviously could

ANGLE ON TWO GRINGOS

Crewcut dressed in casual clothes Clearly American
One of them writes something in a BOOK

PRESIDENTIAL PALACE GUATEMALA CITY EXT DAY

HILDA GADEAS BASEMENT APARTMENT INT DAY

The electricity is out HILDA is cooking stew over a Primus
stove CHE storms around the small apartment Mauser Bolo

ASSOCIATES are present all visibly agitated

CHE
This is bullshit We could have set up
a roadblock Nobody was interested

LEFTIST
You cant do by yourself what your
own Government isnt willing to do

PATOJO
It isnt the Government Its us
Guatemala isnt ready for a
Revolution But some day --

He stares sadly at one of the LEAFLETS which announce the
imminent arrival of the Military Usurper CASTILLO ARMAS

HILDA puts plates of stew on the table Everyone gloomily tucks
in

CHE

CUBAN smiling ushers them in --

MARIA ANTONIA GONZALEZ APARTMENT INT NIGHT

Decorated with Posters celebrating the Wrestler AVELINO PALOMO
MARIA ANTONIAs husband

CHE HILDA and PATOJO enter a thick miasma of cigar smoke and
banter The small apartment is packed with ANTI-BATISTA CUBAN
EXILES smoking drinking coffee and rum and talking politics

MAMBO MUSIC playing on the Gramaphone is almost lost beneath the
din

HILDA and MARIA ANTONIA exchange kisses CHE and MARIA ANTONIA
shake hands Smiling she leads him through the throng towards
the Kitchen outside which stand two more heavy-looking MEN
packing pistols

The BODYGUARDS eyeball CHE but do not frisk him

They let him enter keeping HILDA and EL PATOJO outside

MARIA ANTONIAS KITCHEN INT NIGHT

Extremely small made even smaller by the presence of an
enormous man - very wide and tall big without being fat
with very black hair and a moustache - FIDEL CASTRO 29

FIDEL peers into a big pot of SPAGHETTI SAUCE

He pours half a bottle of red wine into it

FIDEL
You like red wine

CHE
I dont drink

FIDEL
(approvingly)
Neither do I A good Revolutionary doesnt
drink But when I do I like Chivas
Regal Or Isla de Tesoro Rum Its
the best there is From my country

CHE pulls a little bag out of his shirt
He starts filling a pan with water

CHE
Yerba Mate From my country

FIDEL
Oh yeah You know why Argentinians go
out on the balcony in a lightning storm

CHE
Because they think that God is taking
their picture Thats the oldest
joke I know --

(starts boiling the water)

-- and the biggest mistake we all make
Argentine Cuban Mexican - what does
it matter Were all the same people

FIDEL looks at CHE with increased interest

A CUBAN in a leather jacket enters and hands FIDEL a paper
FIDEL studies it makes notes and hands it back

FIDEL
Dont let anyone else in for now

CUBAN
For how long

FIDEL
Ten twenty minutes How do I know Im busy

MARIA ANTONIAS APARTMENT INT NIGHT

EL PATOJO waits patiently HILDA makes small talk with MARIA
ANTONIA The GUARDS are not letting anyone else into the
kitchen

SECOND CUBAN
How much longer do I have to wait
Its already been two hours --

The GUARDS shrug

From the KICHEN comes the sound of passionate argument and
laughter

KITCHEN INT NIGHT
FIDEL pounds the spaghetti spoon on the kitchen table

FIDEL
Look The basic problem Im facing is --

CHE
No money no soldiers

FIDEL
No I will get money and I will get
soldiers The basic problem is an
entrenched oligarchy Even when I get
rid of Batista theyre going to try
and put another stooge in his place

CHE
The problems bigger than that
The struggle in Cuba is part of the
continental struggle against the Yankees
The Revolution in Cuba will be of
international significance Its
leader will be a World Leader --

FIDEL
But hell still have to be PRACTICAL
You know Colonel Bayo Hes a military
tactician fought in the Spanish War (CONT )

FIDEL (CONT )

against the Fascists One-eyed man
Told me hed become a cynic and was
going to charge me for his services
I said fine But you know what

CHE
What Che

FIDEL
Hes been working for me for six months
and he hasnt charged me a Peso Thats
because he believes in what were doing
- just like everybody here

APARTMENT INT NIGHT

HILDA MARIA ANTONIA EL PATOJO - everyone except FIDELs
BODYGUARDS - has fallen asleep the dinner long forgotten

Sounds of FIDEL and CHEs debate continue off screen

KITCHEN INT SHORTLY BEFORE DAWN

Its getting light outside CHE and FIDEL sit in two chairs
facing each other hitting each other on the knee for emphasis

CHE
But thats the way its bound to be
Eventually in the Revolutionary State
everyone will work because they want
to We will abolish money

FIDEL
Absolutely right

CHE
The Revolution will create the New Man -
look I dont have any possessions to
leave to my wife and child and I dont
regret it Im happy its that way
The New Man - the Man of the 21st Century -
will be the same Hell feel anguish
when someone is assassinated in any
corner of the world and elation when (CONT )

CHE (CONT )
in any corner of the world the banner
of liberty is raised

FIDEL stares into CHEs eyes They are very close

FIDEL
When the Revolution triumphs no one
in Cuba will go hungry or lack for
medical attention There will be
jobs for everyone and everyone will
learn to read and write The only
people who need be afraid are Counter-
Revolutionaries traitors moneylenders
prostitutes and perverts

CHE
Absolutely right

FIDEL
Youre a doctor arent you
Im going to need doctors

CHE
Im at your orders Che

FIDEL
What is it with this Che business
I thought you were called Che

CHE
Everyone is called Che Its
Argentine slang a nickname
It means buddy

FIDEL

Watching

RAUL
Oh for Christs sake Who does he think

ANGLE ON FIDEL

Walking over He addresses the prone and supine MEN
thoughtfully in a voice of infinite SADNESS

FIDEL
Men the struggle ahead of us is very
long If you become exhausted so easily
you will be left behind And I am
personally ashamed that Che a foreigner
an Argentine has gone on training
while all of you Cubans - and you Raul
my own brother - just lie here

ANGLE ON THE MEN

HILDA and CHEs new baby HILDITA is in a basket on the floor
beside them She cries

COL BAYO
(going through his notes)
Ive told the men to throw out their
razors and toothbrushes You wont
need them where youre going

HILDA enters deposits mending picks up BABY and laundry

HILDA
Che doesnt grow much of a beard anyway

FIDEL
Also if you calculate 15 minutes a day
spent shaving thats something like
5000 minutes a year wasted

BAYO
Precisely --

(lowers his voice as HILDA leaves)
About the sexual matter I have arranged
for a certain house here to provide
services for our men This way they
will not risk disease or overindulgence
They must continue to provide us with
a written report of their activities

It will be good training for the Sierras

CHE
There wont be any prostitutes in the
Sierra Maestra The men will have
their minds on other things

exploiting countries of the West

attached to everything they do Their
stuff is rubbish Their tractors dont
work When we no longer suit their
purpose theyll abandon us --

FIDEL
I know But this is my world and I
have to make decisions in it and live
with the consequences

family men

talents dont you think

CHE says nothing The double doors open and the GROUP OF

Fidel
At this hour I remember many things

repeat themselves
I formally resign from my duties and
my post as Minister Other lands

I can do what you cant because of
your responsibilities at the helm of
Cuba and the time has come for us
to separate
I free Cuba of any responsibility
except that which stems from its
example

sense wasting paper with my scribbles
Until victory always Country or death

POMBO taps CHE on the arm

The atmosphere is tense MARIO MONJE a young Party zealot
leans against the wall staring at CHE with obvious disapproval

CHE
Obviously I would appreciate the support
of the Bolivian Communist Party But
if the Party cannot give me its support
the operation will continue as planned

KOLLE
Well Comrade Che I think you would
find the Partys support highly valuable
We have very good contacts here My
brother for example He is a colonel
and an Army Chief of Staff

CHE
You are the head of the Communist Party
and your brother is an Army Colonel

KOLLE
(nods)
That is the way things are here
Do you speak Quechua or Aymara

CHE
Not yet but I intend to

KOLLE
Ah Our President General Barrientos
was born in an obscure village and
speaks both languages fluently As
a result many of the peasants who
are not yet politically enlightened
tend to support him I am sure
however that you have supporters
in the countryside who can assist you

CHE
At least half my men are Bolivian

KOLLE
Yes but where are they from
The country or the city

CHE
Some of them are miners
Most are from La Paz

KOLLE nods He looks at MONJE

KOLLE
The Bolivian Communist Party cant
commit itself to a Guerrilla War
unless there is a substantial
Bolivian element For example
if Comrade Monje here who speaks
Quechua and Aymara were political
and military leader --

CHE
Certainly not I am the leader

PAUSE They all glare at each other
KOLLE
Ill have to give this matter some

more thought

fight cant be won Many failed

and pro-China

FIDEL
I understand

(he rises paces)
Nevertheless I hope you will give
Comrade Che every assistance
given the circumstances

KOLLE
But the circumstances make this
very difficult for us

FIDEL
I am sure they are And I would
never tell you how to run your
business

MONJE
The Government is already aware that
Che is in Bolivia There is a real
possibility his group will be destroyed

FIDEL goes to the wall-length window He looks down at the HUGE
MURAL OF CHE below

FIDEL
I want you to do the very best you
can given the circumstances

SCHOOL HOUSE HIGUERA INT DUSK

The door opens CHE is thrust into the mud-walled single-
room school house He eases himself into one of the small
childrens chairs still hunched over from his asthma
Desperate for distraction he studies the blackboard on which
is written

TENGO FE EN DIOS - I have Faith in God

CHE stakes a drag off his Astoria to calm his asthma-It works
momentarily But then he doubles over wheezing “overcome

SCHOOL HOUSE EXT NIGHT

WILLY is under guard in a lean-to adjacent to the School House’
He looks up as TWO ARMY JEEPS arrive cutting a slow path
through the crowd that has gathered

ANGLE ON AN ARMY COLONEL AND TWO CIA MEN

One of them GONZALES climbing down from a Jeep and entering the

SCHOOL HOUSE INT NIGHT

The CIA MEN and the ARMY COLONEL interrogate the ill CHE

SCHOOL HOUSE INT DAY

CHE sits against the wall trying desperately to catch his
breath

He puts tobacco in his pipe

He hears a brief scuffle outside The BLAST of a machine gun
WILLYs dying cry

He lowers his head biting on his knuckles
When he lifts his head HIS ASTHMA HAS DISAPPEARED
He lights his pipe calmly

The door opens

An ARMY SERGEANT stands there holding an M-2 rifle
SEVERAL SOLDIERS crowd the doorway behind him watching
CHE raises his head looks his executioner in the eye

CHE
Tell my wife she should remarry

The SERGEANT nods CHE draws on his pipe

SERGEANT
Id like to have the pipe

CHE
No

The SERGEANT raises his machine gun and OPENS FIRE
The smoke clears FLASHBULBS begin to pop

Angle on HANDS reaching for CHEs body taking his pipe his
tobacco his watch

PALACE OF THE REVOLUTION HAVANA EXT NIGHT
FIDEL CASTRO addresses a large crowd gathered in silence

Beside him are RAUL and PRESIDENT DORTICOS Behind vast
portraits of CHE CAMILO JOSE MARTI

FIDEL
At first it was impossible to believe
that Che was dead - especially when
the Bolivians refused to produce his
body But now there can be no doubt
about it As a Guerrilla Che had an
Achilles heel it was his excessive
bravery his absolute disregard of
danger This was something that was
very difficult for us since we knew
that his life his experience his
value his prestige all that he
represented --

ABOVE THE BOLIVIAN JUNGLE EXT DAY
An object drops from a helicopter

It is a BODY wrapped in a blanket spiralling downward towards
the impenetrable jungle

FIDEL VO
-- were worth more incomparably more
than the evaluation he perhaps made
of himself

CARIQUIMA CHILE EXT DAWN

At first light the surviving Cuban Guerrillas POMBO BENIGNO
and URBANO heavily wrapped against the cold cross the border
from Bolivia into Chile

FIDEL VO
His enemies believe that by destroying
his body they have destroyed his ideas
his revolutionary spirit But I ask
the question how will the poorest
people of the world express themselves
henceforth By being like Che
What do we want our future generations
to be like To be like Che
How shall we educate our children

PALACE OF THE REVOLUTION HAVANA EXT NIGHT
ANGLE ON CHES CHILDREN
The younger ones fidget The older ones eyes fill with tears
FIDEL OS
We shall teach them to be like Che

SLOW FADE IN

SILLUSTANI PERU EXT AFTERNOON

We are back at the pre-Incan NECROPOLIS on the shores of Lake
Umayo which CHE and ALBERTO visited many years before

The same INDIAN GUIDE conducts a party of SCHOOL CHILDREN
through the ruined burial towers of the once-powerful warriors
and priests

The date is not established but it is obviously during the
Revolutionary Regime of GENERAL JUAN VELASCO ALVARADO --

-- the Leftist Government which attempted to re-establish Perus
proud Prehispanic heritage to integrate the indigenous people
into society and to eradicate the most obvious distinctions
between the classes

Hence all the LITTLE CHILDREN are dressed in traditional
Peruvian garb - the boys in blue ponchos the girls in red

INDIAN GUIDE
This is the burial grounds of the Great
Incas In each CHULPA a General is
buried In the white ones over there
are the Priests

ANGLE ON THE CHILDREN

Most of them of obvious indigenous blood Fascinated they
follow their INDIAN GUIDE writing in their notebooks

INDIAN GUIDE

The Incas had the power to MELT STONE

They used a special herb to do it

There is a bird that uses the same

herb today to melt a hole for its nest --
ANGLE ON A SMALL BIRD
Digging into the solid stone of one of the ancient CHULPAS
It holds a sprig of herb tight in its beak

The herb melts the rock

TILT DOWN TO REVEAL
An old bottle jammed among the stones
A piece of yellowed paper within reads

ERNESTO GUEVARA DE LA SERNA
