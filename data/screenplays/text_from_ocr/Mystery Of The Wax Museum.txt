Mystery of the Wax Museum

FADE IN ON
TITLE PROLOGUE LONDON 1920

DISSOLVE TO

1 INT MUSEUM OF IVAN IGOR
where he exhibits groups and individuals done in wax
The figures are of historic characters and events
The place is almost in darkness as the steel blinds
are drawn on the windows facing the street Through
the back and side windows we see and hear a pouring
rain At the fade in we hear the distant rumbling of
thunder and shortly thereafter there is a blinding
flash of lightning through the unshuttered windows
showing in clear relief a brutal sinister face the
black hood and cowl suggesting a medieval monk We
see lying at the foot of the monkish figure a
seminude figure of a woman whose back is sadly
lacerated She is lying face down In the monks hand
is a knout or cat-o-nine-tails as though he had
been punishing her

In the background of this shot we see a workbench and
a work light The vague figure of Igor is seen at
work on a nearly completed bust DOLLY UP TO A
CLOSE-UP of Igors hands We see that they are the
sensitive fine hands of an artist dexterous in
their delicate occupation

CUT TO

2 FULL FIGURE OF IGOR as he steps back from the bench
Evidently satisfied he goes to a basin of water and
puts his hands in it and stands as though resting them

3 EXT STREET LONG SHOT MUSEUM IN BACKGROUND
It is raining and we see an occasional flash of
lightning The figure of Worth on the opposite side
of street from museum walking rapidly AWAY FROM
CAMERA comes to a point diagonally opposite museum
and glances furtively about starts toward the
entrance When a policeman appears he darts quickly
to a doorway concealing himself The officer crosses
the street and disappears along an intersecting
street Worth makes a second endeavor to approach the
museum when a hansom cab draws up to the curb and
Dr Rasmussen and Golatily alight and cross the
sidewalk toward door Worth slinks back to his hiding
place The cab draws away

A beastly hour to disturb the fellow

delighted

They knock at door

washing hands He straightens up and glances toward
door showing annoyance then starts toward door
The knock is repeated

EXT MUSEUM

Rasmussen is pressing his face to glass looks
through and we see through the glass panel of the
door Igor approaching When he glimpses his
visitors his expression changes from annoyance to
one of extreme pleasure and hastening his stride he
opens the door quickly

IGOR
(with slight foreign accent)
Well well my friend this is an
unexpected pleasure

RASMUSSEN

(shaking hands with Igor)
I shouldnt have thought of disturbing
you but it happens the friend I told you
of is leaving tomorrow to supervise some
new excavations in Egypt and he was
anxious to look at your collection
before going away May I present Mr
Golatily

IGOR
It is a great pleasure I have heard so
much about you

INT MUSEUM
The three men enter museum Igor closing the door and
locking it Igor laughs

IGOR
My children will become conceited that so
distinguished a critic has thought them
interesting enough to review

impatiently

Igor throws light switches one at a time each
circuit illuminating a different group He names them
as he throws each switch

IGOR
Sidney Carton on the Guillotine

CLOSE SHOT
of the figure We hear Golatilys voice

GOLATILYS VOICE
Very interestingly done

CAMERA PANS TO figure of Sir Walter Raleigh as the
lights are thrown on this figure We hear Igors
voice

IGORS VOICE
Sir Walter Raleigh

RASMUSSENS VOICE
I was particularly interested in this one
See the fineness with which he has mounted
that beard

CAMERA PANS TO figure of Joan dArc as lights are
thrown on it and we hear Igors voice

IGORS VOICE
Joan dArc

GOLATILYS VOICE
Its a pity to race through such an
exhibition One should have time to
really study them

CAMERA PANS TO figure of Voltaire The lights are
thrown on and we hear Igors voice

IGORS VOICE
Voltaire

The two visitors are standing at the moment beside the
figure of Voltaire Golatily backs away from it half
closing his eyes and studying it critically

GOLATILY
You could almost expect him to speak I
9A

wonder what hed say after all these years
Igor joins them laughing

IGOR
You would be astonished He is more
difficult now to those in authority
than even the records show He was a very
stubborn person I assure you

RASMUSSEN
Stubborn

IGOR

Unbelievably For days I argued with
this fellow before I could get him as I
wanted him But always I triumphed

(he laughs)
and few people triumphed over
Voltaire And here

(he throws light switch on

a peasant mother and child)
we have something that pleases me
though of no historic importance It was
done because I love to model children

The group is a peasant mother two children playing at
her feet and a nursing babe at her breast

EXT STREET IN FRONT OF MUSEUM
Worth as he throws away cigarette impatiently and
takes new place of concealment

INT MUSEUM
The three men are strolling toward the figure of
Marie Antoinette

GOLATILY
But you have no right to hide such genius
in a side street museum

IGOR
(goes to light switch)
You are too gracious These things have
some merit I suspect but this--
(throws switch)
» I am convinced is fine
(Joining the group)

GOLATILY
(leaning close to figure)
Even those delicate veins the texture of
this flesh -- I have never seen anything
more exquisite

IGOR
(laughing)

My partner believes that I should build a
horror chamber immortalizing the hideous
crimes and criminals of London At such
times Marie Antoinette has reassured me
she has promised me recognition for the
devotion I gave to her

GOLATILY
She will undoubtedly keep her promise If
youll grant me the privilege Id like to
submit this work to the Royal Academy when
I get back

IGOR
(delighted)
You will have won the undying gratitude
of us all
(Glancing over his shoulder)
Is that not so Marie Antoinette

GOLATILY
(as they cross to door)
I regret I cant spend the time Id like
with your exhibition but Im going to
worry the life out of you when I come
back
(The three laugh)

IGOR
It will always afford me great pleasure
to see you
(They shake hands)

GOLATILY
Good night sir

IGOR
Good night
(To Rasmussen)
And I am very grateful to you

The two men pass the spot where Worth has concealed
himself He peers after them from the shadows then
crosses street toward museum and walks toward door of
entrance

INT MUSEUM
Igor with the exuberance of a delighted child runs
to the figure of Marie Antoinette and caresses her

IGOR

You heard what he said You heard this
man who is very celebrated what he said
of you

(He backs away from

the figure laughing)
Ho-ho-ho of course you would say that
You always told me so of course

(Then extending arms to include

all the figures in the gallery)
And you my friends -- Robespierre
Danton Marat Maximilian Savonarola all
of you how will you feel to be famous
again

These figures whom he has addressed individually in
the last speech are all on a raised platform or
balcony and he has turned and gestured toward each
one as he named them He now turns to Voltaire
Walking toward the figure and shaking his finger at
it

IGOR
And even you who scoffed at immortality
who wrote so eloquently against the
thought of immortality you are
experiencing it in spite of yourself

We hear the door open and Igor turns

IGOR
(surprised questioningly)
Hello What are you doing here so late

We hear footsteps of someone approaching him as the
CAMERA SWINGS and Worth walks into picture

WORTH
(brusquely)
I came back for some of the books I am
trying to straighten out the accounts I
dont hope to impress you but I may as
well tell you We havent a farthing

IGOR
(mildly with no great concern)
That is unfortunate

CLOSE-UP WORTH
He is furious

WORTH
Youre right its unfortunate Fifteen
thousand pounds its cost me And you say
its unfortunate as though Id spilled a
spot of grog on my waistcoat

CAMERA ANGLE WIDENS TO A

CLOSE SHOT OF THE TWO

IGOR
(returning to workbench
followed by Worth Igor
shrugs)
Your money may have been well invested
my friend Something important may come
of all this

WORTH
Something important has got to come of
it Do you know that the rent on this
place isnt paid

IGOR
(sits at bench and
starts to work)
Is that a fact

WORTH
(angrily)

No -- Im lying to amuse myself
(Leaning over bench
confidentially)

Now look here Ive an idea that will get

us out of all this We havent twopence

between us but weve got these
(Draws papers from pocket
slaps them on desk before
Igor Igor glances at them
then up at Worth in surprise)

IGOR
Fire insurance

WORTH
Yes theres our way out A fire in this

place would give us ten thousand pounds

Igor rises slowly unable to believe what he hears
IGOR
A fire Is this your idea of humor my
friend

WORTH
(grimly)
I want the money back Ive thrown into
this rubbish heap

IGOR
You are asking to burn these people
you are asking
(Growing excited takes a
few steps away from bench)

16 INT MUSEUM MEDSHOT
Igor makes a sweeping gesture that takes in the entire
room

IGOR
to destroy all this

WORTH
Im not asking you anything Im telling
you what Im going to do

IGOR
And you think I will permit this my
friend

WORTH

Youve got to permit it Whose fault is it
that no one comes here The museum at
Walston Lane does well enough and why
Theyve got Jack the Ripper Burke and
Hare the Mad Butcher the Demon Barber

of Fleet Street and things people pay to
see

IGOR
And they are welcome to them To
perpetuate such creatures is to celebrate
their crimes

WORTH
Well what do you think Im in this for
(Indicating figures changing
tone and attempting to cajole
Igor)
Think of it man a match -- a cigar stub
-- and ten thousand pounds to divide
between us

IGOR
Youre insane

WORTH
Not at all -- let me show you how easily
it can be done
(He strikes match and starts
toward one of the figures)

Igor springs and whirls him about Worth strikes Igor
viciously and they have a terrific struggle in the
course of which Worth seizes a spirit lamp used for
warming wax and hurls it at Igor He misses his mark
but the lighted lamp falls into the folds of the
draperies of one of the figures standing next to that
of Marie Antoinette Igor screams his terror as he
dashes to extinguish the flames and Worth

springing on his back overpowers him By this time
the fire is spreading to one of the other groups
Worth quickly snatches some of the flaming cloth from
this group and tosses it at the feet of other figures
The figures are shown to be melting gradually losing
form and finally the liquid wax itself ignites with
a flash that is almost an explosion Igor is seen to
stir and Worth seizing a heavy staff from the hands
of one of the figures strikes him several times
Apparently satisfied that Igor is helpless Worth now
hurries to a rear door and makes his exit

EXT AREAWAY BACK OF MUSEUM

We see Worth come through door panting and disheveled
He starts away and then returns and locks door after
which he runs from scene

INT MUSEUM

Igor dazed and weak is struggling to his feet He
looks toward the figure of Marie Antoinette its
draperies now a mass of flame He dashes toward it
catching it up in his arms attempting to beat out

the fire The whole room now resembles the inside of

a furnace and as Igor carrying the flaming figure
struggles toward the door a portion of the ceiling
collapses barring his progress He turns and

staggers toward the rear His clothes are blazing He
runs to a small iron trap in floor near which is a
group tableau of Sidney Carton on the Guillotine
Lifting the cover he discloses an empty drain barely
large enough to permit the passage of his body As he
disappears through trap the rope suspending the blade
of the guillotine burns through and the knife falls
decapitating the figure and the head rolls across the
floor

SKYLINE OF NEW YORK (miniature)

On a building in the foreground is an electric sign
the full width of the building which reads New York
Express There is a huge illuminated clock dial
someplace beneath the sign The clock shows one
minute of twelve As the picture fades in and the
minute hand jumps abruptly to exactly twelve another
electric sign showing the numerals 1932 in red
appears immediately beneath the sign New York Express
Simultaneous with this we hear the shrieks of sirens
the honking of automobile horns the screech of boat
whistles in the harbor the ringing of bells the
rapid firing of a pistol somewhere in the distance
the shouting of the crowd indicating the passing of
the old year These sounds in varying degrees
continue all through the following scenes As this
shot dissolves the tone dissolves with it to the
single scream of a siren as we see

An ambulance driving around the corner

EXT OF APARTMENT BUILDING

with all the windows lighted Some windows still have
Christmas ornaments in them The CAMERA ON CRANE
MOVES UP TO various windows As the screaming of the
siren and arrival of ambulance evidently attract the
attention of the dwellers several people open their
windows and look out curiously Some of them are
holding cocktail glasses and as the windows are
opened we hear the strains of radio music and other
sounds of joyous celebrating In the last window we

see Igor in his legitimate make-up -- not as a horror
person -- looking at something across the street
CUT TO

EXT OF OTHER APARTMENT HOUSE AT CORNER

The ambulance parked in front of it and a number of
curious people standing about The door of the
apartment house is opened by a man in uniform and we
see a doctor carrying a medical case coming out of
the house A newspaper reporter runs up the steps to
meet him and says

REPORTER
Anything new Doc

DOCTOR
Nothing we didnt tell you this

opinion -- it was suicide

During this dialogue two internes carrying a
stretcher descend the steps pass the doctor and
place stretcher in ambulance close door of ambulance

With elevated road extending full width of street An
old-fashioned disreputable brick building with an
iron grating along the edge of walk beyond which is
an areaway and a flight of stone steps leading to
basement door There is also a door on the street level
The figure of a man approaches the house The CAMERA
SEES only his back We hear the distant sound of the
New York celebration and two girls passing the man
who is walking AWAY FROM CAMERA blow horns at him and
throw confetti on him He does not answer He passes

them and admits himself to house with latchkey

CAMERA FOLLOWS him through a corridor into a room as
dilapidated and forbidding as the exterior of the
house The room evidently used as an office is
furnished with an ancient battered desk and chairs
The walls are bare and in places the paper and even
bits of plaster have been torn away

The figure of the man enters and throws on the lights
He goes to the desk picks up a phone and dials a
number sitting in swivel chair with his back to

STREET OUTSIDE THE MORGUE

A policeman walking leisurely along his beat reaches
the iron gate and glances up at the sign above the
arch which reads Morgue We hear the distant
shouting singing trumpeting After the officer has
disappeared an upper window of the building opens
and the hideous face of the Monster appears as he
leans out of the window following the progress of
the policeman along the street

INT MORGUE FULL SHOT
(It is necessary to give this business in detail but
it will be played quickly as the Monster moves with

astonishing rapidity)

The room is almost in darkness the only light coming
from a window well upstage and at one side We see
dimly a row of slabs mounted on wheels They are all
occupied the bodies being covered with sheets The
Monster glides quickly among them with a flashlight
turning down the sheets and inspecting the faces
finally locating the one he seems to have been in
search of CAMERA COMES TO A

CLOSE SHOT OF MONSTER

bending over slab as he examines figure illuminated by
flashlight We do not see the features of the corpse
As the Monster straightens up he utters a horrible
gurgling retching murmur of joy and we see him
clearly for the first time

CLOSE-UP MONSTER

A black-cloaked figure disproportionate and
grotesque the face a horrible formless mass of
scarred tissue He has practically no forehead His
face is a shriveled bald pate of seared skin and bone
which recedes to a pointed cranium of unnatural
contour His eyes are alight with fanaticism and
insanity The face is a blot of drawn unwholesomely
colored hairless skin He is lipless noseless and
what traces of human features remain are frightfully
distorted CAMERA RECEDES TO

MED SHOT

and TRAVELS WITH him as he pushes the carriage
quickly to the back window and places it against the
sill feet first

CLOSE SHOT AT WINDOW

He opens the window which has a single bar from top
to bottom dividing its center He leans out and
whistles During all of this we have been hearing the
joyous shouts of the merrymakers In answer to his
signal there is a single whistle from someplace below
He throws the sheet aside and fastens a rope around
and under the arms of the corpse which he pushes
slowly across the sill into space After lowering the
body there is a whistle from below He throws the
remainder of the coil of rope out the window but on
the opposite side of the upright bar so that the
rope forms a double strand outside permitting him

to slide to ground level CAMERA ANGLE WIDENS and we
PAN WITH the Monster as he returns the slab to its
original position He hears someone approaching and
stretches out at length on the slab covering

himself with the sheet The voices grow louder and
the CAMERA SWINGS PICKING UP TWO attendants and
FOLLOWING them as they enter One of them throws on
the lights and they wheel another body into place
beside the slab on which the Monster is concealed

FIRST ATTENDANT
New Years Eve aint what it used to be
This is only the second one tonight

SECOND ATTENDANT
Yeah times are sure tough

FIRST ATTENDANT
What happened to this one

SECOND ATTENDANT
Husband slapped her full of lumps said she
talked too much

The men turn and start out of the scene The body
having just been embalmed has a muscular reflex and
rises to a rigid semisitting posture

FIRST ATTENDANT
(frightened)
Whats that

SECOND ATTENDANT
Embalming fluid makes em jump

He returns coolly and pushes the body into its proper
position The action causes a horrible rasping sound
peculiar to corpses

SECOND ATTENDANT
(coldly)
Aint that just like a woman always
has to have the last word

CAMERA FOLLOWS the two men as they exit in the
direction from which they came throwing off the
lights and shutting the door after them CAMERA PANS
BACK to the Monster as he springs from the slab and
FOLLOWS him as he crosses to the window climbs
through and lowers himself over the sill

Showing base of upright bar of window with rope
looped over Evidently safe on the ground the
Monster pulls one end of rope and we see it running

During this insert we hear a crescendo of horns
shouts etc finally dominated by the clack of a
wooden noisemaker that blends gradually with the
myriad clicking of a number of typewriters as we

quarrels continually throughout the picture with the
girl there is an underlying and very strong bond of
friendship and respect between the two)

clothes men who evidently knows Florence crosses and

FIRST DOCTOR
en I was called doctor the girl had
een dead for possibly three or four
ours My examination showed clearly
at she died of laudanum poisoning I

ccident an overdose Her eyes indicated
at she used narcotics frequently

todtctyPose

SECOND DOCTOR
What was the police theory

FIRST DOCTOR
Suicide

SECOND DOCTOR
Leave any message

FIRST DOCTOR
No Thats why I thought death might have
been accidental

One of the plain-clothes men joins the two doctors

FIRST DOCTOR
Who got the information about Winton
Flannery

DETECTIVE
Everyone knows they was livin together
But the way they fought youd of thought
they was married

FIRST DOCTOR
Been separated quite some time hadnt
they

DETECTIVE

Yeah He was playin up to some other
twist Wintons in bad because he left
there just before she folded up

SECOND DOCTOR
Well if she committed suicide with
laudanum she probably took it in its
crude form and well find it in that or
very close to that state If someone gave
it to her it would be diluted

DETECTIVE
How could he give it to her

FIRST DOCTOR
In a cup of coffee or a glass of whiskey

The door bursts open and one of the attendants rushes
in and going directly to the two doctors speaks

ATTENDANT
The Gale body is gone

FIRST DOCTOR
Gone What are you talking about

SECOND DOCTOR
(speaking almost simultaneous
with the first)
The body gone Absurd

DETECTIVE
Wait a minute
(To the attendant)
What happened What do you mean the
bodys gone

ATTENDANT
Just that Its gone -- vanished --
disappeared

DETECTIVE

You mean somebody stole the body

INT CELL IN THE TOMBS

Winton seated on the edge of his cot CAMERA SWINGS
AROUND to reveal the cell door being opened by a guard
Florence enters and goes to boy He is a rather
handsome but weak dissipated type who arouses our
sympathy without winning our respect

FLORENCE
How do you do Im from the Express

Winton looks up When he speaks his sentences are
halting and broken Hes badly frightened

WINTON

Yeah I suppose you people will crucify
me for something I didnt do

(His voice rising

almost to falsetto)
I didnt You understand that I
didnt do it She -- tried before --

(Buries his face in

hands choking sob)

FLORENCE
(Sits on cot beside him
pats his shoulder)
Come on old man that wont do You know

WINTON

(springing to feet and

pacing back and forth)
Yes sure thats fine While Im proving
my innocence you people are going to
uncover every petty kid trick I ever did
» youre going to write editorials about
every cocktail I ever drank Anything that
any sane normal person might have done
will have a sinister meaning if I did it

(He is almost crying at

this point sitting on

cot)
Go on Get out I dont want to talk to
you

(He rises and crosses quickly

as though to open door then

realizing that he is locked in

leans face against the bars

fighting to control tears)

Florence follows him and places her hand on his shoulder

FLORENCE
Listen kid Youre in a tough spot and
you can make it a whole lot easier for
yourself if you cut out the cry-baby

WINTON

FLORENCE
Uh-huh Do you remember what she said
What did you talk about

WINTON
She laughed and told me that we were
being silly that we didnt care for
each other any more but we neednt
hate each other

(He sobs through the

finish of this speech)
She said she wanted to be friends

FLORENCE
I see Was that all she said

WINTON
(recovering self-control
to some degree)
We planned a trip for her I was going to
send her to Bermuda

FLORENCE
You werent going with her

WINTON

(Paces floor pounding palm of
hand with fist desperately)
Why didnt I take her out somewhere But
she was laughing and seemed so happy

FLORENCE
Well lets get back to the case in hand
They ordered an autopsy and discovered
her body had been stolen from the morgue

EDITOR
(glancing from desk where
he has been idly scratching
with a pencil)

FLORENCE
I wouldnt be trying beloved I would
hang him And another thing all this

EDITOR
Hes getting a break aint he Hes

grandfather was smarter than the Indians
FLORENCE
Well anyway he couldnt have copped

making me sore

FLORENCE
(rising angrily)
Well I wont work on it from that angle

EDITOR
Oh you wont -- you were pretty tough

CLOSE-UP OF THREE CITY STREET-SWEEPERS PUSH BROOMS
held end to end pushing ahead of them a large quantity
of confetti bits of paper and refuse of the hilarious

night before CAMERA PULLS BACK revealing three street-
sweepers In the background we see the sign

LONDON WAX MUSEUM -- GRAND OPENING
TONIGHT
FIRST TIME IN AMERICA

and in front of the place as CAMERA MOVES UP AGAIN
TO the entrance we see a janitor sweeping off the
sidewalk He is a strange unwholesome-looking
character He has swept most of the sidewalk pushing
the collected debris into a pile in the gutter when
his attention is caught by the protruding end of a
whiskey bottle which shows in the pile He picks up
the bottle and sees that there is a little bit of
liquid left in it and he drains it drop by drop
into his mouth He stoops to examine the pile further

IGORS VOICE
(off scene)
Otto Otto Get in here

CAMERA FOLLOWS him as he turns and goes into the museum

INT MUSEUM MED SHOT OF IGOR

In background we see a veritable beehive of activity
A number of workmen including painters carpenters
are busy building and designing screenlike backgrounds
for the various exhibits placing figures on platforms
etc In the center of the room watching them is Ivan
Igor CAMERA MOVES TO A

CLOSE SHOT OF IGOR

He is much changed but still recognizable as the man
we knew before the fire His beard and hair are almost
white and have been permitted to grow to far greater
length but the features are essentially the same
except that when he speaks or moves his face is
strangely immobile He is seated in a wheelchair
which is propelled by sprocket wheels on the arms of
the chair In order to manage this there is a special
cup or basket attached to the handles as his hands
are hideously deformed and practically useless for

the purpose He is impatient and angry with the
workers venting his anger immediately the janitor
appears Igor propels the chair forward

MED SHOT IGOR AND JANITOR

Igor stopping points angrily at floor immediately
surrounding some of the groups where shavings
excelsior and other packing material and debris are
scattered

IGOR
(to janitor)
Does it take you all morning to sweep
that patch of sidewalk Come clean up
this mess and dont try to sweep this
trash behind those screens I want it
removed

JANITOR
Yes sir

Starts to clean up around nearest group Igor wheels
toward another group FOLLOWED BY CAMERA and
addresses workmen angrily

IGOR
Come look you fellows You spend two
days on something that should have taken
two hours

One of the workmen turns angrily

WORKMAN
Say listen Old-Timer they abolished
slavery in this country a long time ago

IGOR
Is it slavery to do what youre being paid
for I have announced the opening of this
museum tonight

Wheels angrily away The workman laughs CAMERA FOLLOWS
Igor as he wheels to end of museum where Hugo and Ralph
are at work putting the finishing touches on two
individual figures Hugo is a man of middle age with
an insane crafty face unkempt hair and several days
growth of beard He smiles continually to himself as
though some secret of his own amused him He is deaf
and dumb and when excited or angry emits strange
terrifying growls similar to the noises we heard

the Monster utter Ralph is rather a nice-looking
youngster and seems engrossed in what he is doing

CLOSE SHOT Igor comes to a stop near Ralph and sits
inspecting his work

IGOR
(bitingly)
If my curiosity is not too great would
you mind telling me what manner of animal
this is you are designing

RALPH
One of the maids-in-waiting for that
Elizabethan group

IGOR
(raising his hands to heaven)
And he isnt struck dead This man he
lives It would be interesting to know
young man where and when you studied
anatomy

RALPH
(steps back a little and
looks critically at the
figure)
That doesnt seem so bad to me What is wrong
with it

IGOR
Everything my friend And you hope to be a
great sculptor --
(laugh)
A great sculptor Look -- this forearm is at
least two inches too long

RALPH
But the composition as a whole -- Ive
tried to keep a sketchy freedom

IGOR
If it is freedom to represent people with
limbs that dont match -- cripples -- you

have achieved your purpose Anatomy
Heaven forgive you You must have studied
with a sideshow of freaks

CAMERA SWINGS as Igor whirls chair and sees Hugos
piece

IGOR
And this fellow Look I ask you
look what this cobbler is doing

Ralph grins Igor takes one of the crutches that ride
beside him on chair and reaching out pokes Hugos
shoulder Hugo turns with a startled growl

IGOR
(pointing with crutch to
figure which looks not unlike
Hugo himself -- shouts)
What is this Are you so beautiful that
you make everything in your own likeness

Hugo utters an uncanny sound identified with deaf-mutes
Igor realizing that Hugo doesnt hear him just waves
him back to work

IGOR
Its a great mercy of Providence that this
fellow cannot hear
(Turning back to Ralph
suddenly extends two horribly

maimed clawlike hands toward

Ralph)
Look Look at those claws If I had those
hands of yours I would show you the
meaning of what you are trying to do All
those beautiful things that were destroyed
I could restore It is a great irony that
you people without souls should have hands

EXT ALLEY ENTRANCE REAR OF MUSEUM

We see a truck backing in and Sparrow whom we first
saw at Worths house climbs down from the drivers
seat and enters museum

INT MUSEUM
Igor is still speaking

IGOR
But go on go back to work It is hopeless
to talk to such people

He suddenly stops and turns his head CAMERA SWINGS TO
FOLLOW his line of vision and PICKS UP rear entrance

rapidly toward Sparrow CAMERA FOLLOWING

IGOR

Have you got it Is it completed

SPARROW
Yes sir its here on the truck but its
pretty heavy -- Ill need help

IGOR

(turns and shouts)
Otto You and one of those other fellows
Come help Professor Darcey

Janitor comes forward followed by two workmen

JANITOR
Yes sir

IGOR
And hurry please This figure has still
to be mounted and dressed

Sparrow exits with three men leaving door open Igor
wheels back toward Ralph and Hugo He laughs
delightedly addressing Ralph

IGOR
And now my friend you are to see
something that one can in truth describe

as art Professor Darcey doesnt try to
keep freedom and sketchiness in his
figures He is an artist He works at
home hours when such people as you are
loafing He is an artist

The four men carry in a long narrow box similar to
the one that was delivered to Worth

SPARROW
Shall we unpack it

IGOR
Yes

One of the workmen takes a claw hammer from strap in
overalls and starts removing the lid as Igor wheels
himself quickly toward Sparrow and the workers CAMERA
FOLLOWS and as the lid of the box is removed some
burlap and other packing materials lifted out and the
box raised on end we see the head shoulders and one
arm of a beautiful lifelike figure of a girl We
identify the face immediately as that of Joan Gale As
the workers go about removing the rest of the packing
Igor whirls and addresses the other workers who have
advanced and stand admiring the figure

IGOR
Get back to work You will have plenty
of time to look at this

As the workers return to their various jobs one of
them grins

WORKER

with the institution in London the one figure

Marie Antoinette)

young man standing beside statue of Marie Antoinette

state which Igor detects)

As Ralph continues his explanation to Charlotte CAMERA
TRUCKS UP BEHIND Florence and OVER HER SHOULDER THROUGH
glass panel we see interior of museum with the various
figures Close to door we see the janitor carrying on his
shoulder the Joan Gale figure which he places on a
pedestal in foreground He carries the figure in such a
position that we see the back of it first and as he
places it on the pedestal he turns it around so that we
see the face CAMERA CONCENTRATES for several minutes

on this figure

CLOSE-UP FLORENCE

Florence stares at it puzzled Then recognition dawns
Ralph enters PAST CAMERA and goes to door He is about
to hurry into museum when Florence detains him by a
hand on his arm As she turns we get the two in

out of a trance)
Nothing -- nothing at all my boy I
should like to meet your friend

Florence taking advantage of the introduction slips
away aS CAMERA ANGLE WIDENS and to avoid suspicion
looks carefully at several figures during the
following conversation finally arriving before the
Joan Gale figure where she stops and studies the
figure carefully

RALPH
Why certainly sir My fiancée Charlotte

(Igor extends hand to her)

IGOR
If you will forgive this poor crippled
stump my dear I am very happy to know
you

CHARLOTTE
Thank you
IGOR

(laughs whimsically)
Although you would be amused if I were
to tell you that I knew you before you
were born Before this terrible thing
happened to me

(His voice quavers)
I made a very beautiful statue Even
if I had not met with this disaster I
could never have hoped to do anything
finer probably nothing quite so fine
And my child you are that figure come
to life I wonder some time would you
pose for one of my sculptors who does
very excellent work

CHARLOTTE
Id love to at any time

Florence who seems to have satisfied herself as
to the identity of the figure turns abruptly
and comes toward them

FLORENCE
Well Im a woman who craves nourishment
Lets ankle out of here and find a beanery
Come on Moon-struck

RALPH

Igor who seems to be in much better temper than we
have seen him for some time laughs

IGOR
Exquisite But I am going to rechristen
her for you my friend She is not to be
Charlotte any more she is Marie
Antoinette

Igor points to picture of himself and the figure of
Marie Antoinette

Sparrow who has been standing near them comes closer
to Igor as CAMERA MOVES UP TO CLOSE SHOT A look of

extreme cunning appears on his face

SPARROW
She is exactly like that statue

Picture clearly shown on wall

IGOR
She is the soul of that statue

SPARROW
I wonder if I could have her pose for me

CAMERA ANGLE WIDENS as Hugo laughs knowingly Sparrow
turns quickly and looks at him suspiciously

SPARROW

Tapping himself on forehead Igor indicates that Hugo is
a little balmy

and walking past the building she entered stops and
lights a cigarette inspecting the building immediately
adjoining the apartment house There is a large For

Sale or Rent sign on the front of the building giving
the name and address of the agent handling the property
Sparrow goes to a basement door and tries it finding it
locked He is investigating one of the windows when he
sees that he is observed by a passer-by and taking a
notebook from his pocket apparently copies the name
and address of the realty firm from the sign and walks
back in the direction from which he came whistling

EXT ROOF OF VACANT BUILDING

We see a skylight forced open the Monster clambers

out onto the roof and creeps stealthily to edge

peering into lighted window of apartment house CAMERA
FOLLOWS him SHOOTING PAST him into room beyond we see
Charlotte just putting the final touches to her toilette
preparing to put on dress The Monster gauging the
distance carefully springs across space separating
buildings and clings to fire escape ladder like a huge
monkey He leans out from ladder and is about to raise
window sash when the door of the room opens and Florence
enters

Standing beside the door is what appears to be a wax
doorman in uniform There are a number of curious people
looking at the lobby display

ONE OF THE VISITORS
Look at him now Isnt that as real as life

Now the figure suddenly moves his fingers jerkily as
if he were a wax figure then speaks

SPIELER
(walking up and down)
Step right up ladies and gentlemen You
cant afford to miss this exhibition that
has thrilled the monarchs of the world
For the first time America is privileged

to see the collection pronounced by art
lovers to be the finest in the world

During this speech Florence and Charlotte enter the
picture and start toward museum door

INT MUSEUM

We hear music coming from a modern victrola that changes
records by itself Igor in wheelchair is in front of
statue of Sir Walter Raleigh kneeling on a spreading
velvet cloak on ground before the figure of Queen
Elizabeth who is smiling at him graciously

IGOR

The history of these figures my friends
is more interesting perhaps when I tell
you that the originals were destroyed
twelve years ago in a fire in London and
restored only after years of arduous toil
To reproduce the figures destroyed I spent
years training men to do the work that I
can no longer do Some of my workmen have
trained for years before I would let them
undertake a single figure of these groups
that you have been looking at tonight

This has been a close shot of Igor and we assume that
he has been addressing a rather large gathering but as
CAMERA SWINGS we see a pitifully small audience of not
more than ten people

MAIN ENTRANCE OF MUSEUM

CAMERA MOVES UP TO A

CLOSE SHOT OF RALPH
as Charlotte and Florence enter he takes a step forward
to meet them

RALPH
Hello hello Youre late

Charlotte and looks at
her admiringly)
Gee thats a pretty dress Have I
ever seen that before

Well thank goodness thats settled

She walks directly to the figure she suspects CAMERA

group of visitors to the door

RALPH

We hope you have enjoyed seeing these
things tonight I hope you will tell your
friends for we believe we have something
here of genuine public interest

(As the last of the visitors

file through the door)
Good night Thank you Call again

CLOSE SHOT OF FLORENCE

as she inspects the Joan Gale figure We see that all
doubt has been dispelled and that she is absolutely
sure of her ground Glancing about quickly to be sure
she is not observed she stealthily sticks a pin into
the arm of the figure as if convincing herself it is
made of wax

SHOT OF IGOR

As the last of the visitors are leaving Sparrow comes
down behind him and leaning over back of his chair
whispers something to him Igor turns sharply

IGOR
(in intense hushed tone)
Are you sure of that Are you sure

SPARROW
Id know him anywhere

IGOR
Dont lose sight of him This is the
most important thing in my life

Sparrow sees Charlotte and Ralph approaching and signals
Igor to silence As Sparrow walks away Ralph and
Charlotte walk toward Igor smiling

RALPH
(in a rather encouraging tone)
I wouldnt feel too disappointed at the
slimness of your audience tonight Mr
Igor The weather was against you and
the people are tired and getting over
their celebration and preparing to go to
work tomorrow

IGOR

Quite so Quite so

(Extending hand to

Charlotte who has been

close beside Ralph)
And you my little friend my little
Marie Antoinette It is kind of you to be
present

CHARLOTTE
But I think these things are beautiful

IGOR

They are
(To Ralph)

My boy I think you are right Everyone
is tired out today and now that we have
seen my doors open in a new country I
am beginning to realize that I ama
little tired myself You can call that
fellow in from the front I think well
close for the night

RALPH
Yes sir

Ralph walks away toward the front door and CAMERA MOVES
UP TO

100 A CLOSE SHOT OF IGOR AND CHARLOTTE

IGOR
I think I should have felt a little
discouraged tonight but now everything
seems quite as it should be You know
to find just one person who appreciates
my beautiful children here changes
everything for me
(He glances about to see
that he is not observed
and continues)
You must come some time in the morning
when there are no crowds about and I
can give you more of my time

Florence enters and breaks up the conversation

FLORENCE
Good evening Mr Igor Ive been
admiring your works Properly illuminated
they are more impressive than they were
this morning
IGOR
Yes for a time I despaired of ever
achieving the same effects I had abroad
And then lighting came to my rescue

FLORENCE
I was particularly interested in that
group over there

She points and CAMERA SWINGS TO

glancing about and feeling that he is unobserved crosses
quickly to the statue of Joan Gale and raises his hand
as though to caress it when Sparrow appears from behind
another figure grinning evilly

SPARROW

through rear door

Dont you think this would be as good a
time as any to break the news to me
Whats it all about

FLORENCE
Well as one of the interested parties I
suppose I might as well tell you the glad
tidings I think the fellow weve been
following had something to do with the
robbery at the morgue

Winton shows nervousness and distaste

WINTON
Now look here Its not up to us to do
our own detective work Ive had enough
trouble over this matter I dont want
anything more to do with it

FLORENCE
Not even if it gives you a clean bill of
health

WINTON

people to conduct this affair Now if

The Monster appears through the door Worth just made an
exit through comes to the center of the room and stands
listening Evidently they become tired of ringing with
no response for we hear them start to batter in the
door The Monster turns and vanishes quickly the way he
came We hear the door shattered and after a moments
pause an officer appears stealthily with drawn
revolver around the hall door of the room

lights He is talking to Florence and Winton

DETECTIVE
Can you give me a description of the
person you saw

FLORENCE
Not a very good one I guess He wasnt
like anything human He hobbled and swayed
like a monkey and the face from the
glimpse I got of it in the light from the
street was like an African war mask

DETECTIVE
You mean he was colored

FLORENCE
I dont know what he was but he made
Frankenstein look like a lily

The officer comes in from the adjoining room

OFFICER
Well theres nothing on this floor

We hear the men descending stairs from floor above

detective steps to the door

box a little nearer the center of the room and they
start to pry off the lid As they pull one nail it
comes out with a mournful shriek Florence almost falls
over a smaller box in her effort to get away

The people passing are of the type who would be hurrying
to report for some office or clerical job around nine
oclock Charlotte walks into picture glances up and
down street as though looking for someone then glances

at watch and goes to museum door peering through panel
She tries the door and finds it open and enters

INT WAX MUSEUM LONG SHOT
Nobody is in scene Charlotte enters looks about

CHARLOTTE

Ralph Are you here

There is no answer and she starts down the length of

the museum occasionally calling Ralph As she passes
a niche in the wall that contains a half figure of Dante
on the platform the CAMERA MOVES TO CLOSE-UP of that
figure The artificial lids are raised and we see the
eyes of a living person peering through and watching
her progress Over this we hear her calling Ralph
again but the call is growing fainter The lids drop
back into place

the room before she becomes aware of his presence She
stops startled

CHARLOTTE
I beg your pardon -- Is Ralph here

There is no response as Hugo does not hear her She
advances a step farther when he turns and grins at
her

CHARLOTTE
Im looking for Ralph

Hugo still grinning takes a step toward her and makes

the hideous sound identified with deaf-mutes She starts

to back away from him terrified Backing toward portieres
followed by Hugo she suddenly turns and darts through the
curtains Her momentum carries her almost to Igor who is
approaching in wheelchair She extends both her hands to
him delightedly He starts to respond then catching sight
of his crippled claws drops them into his lap

CHARLOTTE
Oh Mr Igor -- Im so glad youre here
-- I dont know why I should be but I was
a little bit afraid

IGOR
Oh So my little friend you have honored
me by accepting my invitation of last night

CHARLOTTE
No -- I -- wanted to speak to Ralph We
had a silly argument last night and I said
something unkind

IGOR

(laughs in a tender

fatherly way)
Oh you children you happy children
Youve quarreled and now youre going to
be friends again And that is as it should
be Never let any stupid misunderstandings
come between you

CHARLOTTE
But it was really my fault

IGOR
(laughs)
And he will probably demand the life of
anyone who agrees with you Let him think

it was his fault He should be along
very shortly But be very stern

before you forgive him especially if it
is your fault While youre waiting

for your friend would you like to see
some new figures I have downstairs

CHARLOTTE
Id love to

CAMERA FOLLOWS them as Igor wheels to top of stairs
leading to studio and workshop below He takes crutches
and struggles painfully to his feet

trouble

It is no trouble at all my child This
is the strange vicarious pleasure that
remains for me -- to see others enjoy
the beauty I used to create

good-naturedly)
My footing is not too secure

what she is referring to She waits until he has
passed into the cloakroom
