BEAVIS AND BUTT-HEAD DO AMERICA
by

Mike Judge and Joe Stillman

The movie begins with scenes of people screaming in horror
and running down the streets of a big city The ground shakes from
what seems like giant footsteps There are pieces of building
debris falling everywhere people getting crushed power lines
coming down etc - complete pandemonium It all looks very much
like a Japanese animated King-Kong or Godzilla movie We hear the
footsteps getting closer and the ground shaking becomes more
intense - more debris falling Then we see a HUGE BLACK TENNIS
SHOE come into frame and smash a National Guard truck As we pan
up we see the white socks then the red shorts the ACDC T-
shirt then we hear the familiar Huh huh huh - only its a
huge soundthis is a THREE-HUNDRED FOOT TALL BUTT-HEAD Butt-—
Kong continues his path of destruction - stomping on cars and
buildings and saying This is cool Huh huh huh

Airplanes and tanks start firing at Butt-Head (Butt-Kong)
He looks irritated and says Cut it out butt-munch Butt-—Head
swats at the planes sending them crashing to the ground and
stomps on the tanks Then something catches his eye Butt-Head
reaches into a skyscraper and picks up a nice looking woman - a
lot like the one from the King Kong movie He looks down at her in
his hand and goes wide-eyed Whoa Huh huh huh The woman
screams in terror as Butt-Head looks down at her and tries a few
lame pick up lines UuuuhHey baby Im like pretty tall Huh
huh huh He swats down a helicopter that is circling his head
Dammit Im trying to score The helicopter goes down in flames
We CUT TO some guys sitting on a tank firing at him They notice
giant footsteps coming from the other direction and turn the tank
around Through their binoculars we see a THREE-HUNDRED FOOT
BEAVIS coming from the horizon The giant Beavis is even more
destructive than Butt-Kong (maybe he could be breathing fire)
Beavis starts trying to pick up on Butt-Heads woman Butt-Head
puts the woman down and he and Beavis begin to go at it leveling
the city with one of their stupid juvenile smack-fights

We CROSS-DISSOLVE from three-hundred foot Beavis shaking
Butt-Kong to Butt-Head asleep on the couch with Beavis shaking
him

start shifting

BEAVIS (CONT)
and Whoaand its like theres
all these weird shapes and its sort of
likeits likelike a MUSIC VIDEO

Tight on Beavis face staring in wonder

THIS IS WHERE THE MUSIC VIDEOHALLUCINATION SEQUENCE BEGINS It
could even be so shameless as to actually have a chyron in the
lower left hand corner

I would like to have a band (White Zombie) do a version of
something like Fire by The Crazy World of Arthur Brown This
is the song that begins I am God of Hellfire and I bring you
fire

The concept of this will depend somewhat on which band we get but
I would like to see it get pretty wild and surreal (If its White
Zombie we could incorporate some of Rob Zombies artwork)

BEAVIS POV

We see the sun above the horizon turn into a giant ball of fire
The ball of fire develops a face and speaks

FIRE
I am God of Hellfire and I bring
you(music begins) Fire
BEAVIS
Whoa This kicks ass

THIS IS THE GREATEST VIDEO BEAVIS HAS EVER SEEN Out of the ball
of fire steps a beautiful woman in a bikini

At first the video is mostly the God of Hellfire chicks in
bikinis and various images of BandBs TV in all its glory

As the videohallucination continues it becomes a psychotic mass
of naked people fire TVs vultures BandB head-banging weird
stuff from my high school notebooks etc
At one point we see the God of Hellfire in a Burger World uniform

As the song winds down we incorporate Muddys car into the
surreal imagery (We should also incorporate their TV as well as
maybe some of the characters from the show that arent in the
movie)

Then we REVEAL Muddys car actually pulling up to BandBs near-dead
bodies

The SONG ENDS as Muddy tosses water on BandB REVEAL they were not
far from the side of a road all along

BandB
Ahhhhghhhhgh

BandB snap out of it They rise and find Muddy hovering over them
with a shotgun

BEAVIS
