As Frank Sinatra croons “NEW YORK NEW YORK” a series of
scenes paint the visual timeline of a growing viral threat

EXT MANHATTAN - BROADWAY AVENUE - DAY

Sidewalks deluged as TOURISTS and LOCALS mingle together A
fleet of YELLOW CABS sit in wait for a traffic light’s shift
to green A normal New York day until --

A convoy of two dozen camouflage HUMVEES bolt through the

intersection It immediately captures everyone’s attention
as they gawk with curiosity

EXT EMPIRE STATE BUILDING - OBSERVATION DECK - DAY

The morning sun rises above New York City blanketing
skyscrapers with an auburn glow

Soles from a pair of overworn sneakers SCUFF across the deck
as a YOUNG BOY approaches a pay telescope A cotton
surgical mask covers his nose and mouth

He inserts a quarter into the change slot Then another
Leaning forward he views the city through the lenses

INT NEW YORK SUPERMARKET - DAY

A major chain though perished and bare Absolute chaos with
racks overturned and carts scattered around An INFANTs
defeating CRIES are heard somewhere in the store

PANNING by the aisles to reveal that every shelf is empty

However in the baby aisle a MOTHER comforts her crying
Infant She desperately searches for a jar of baby food

EXT BRONX - EAST RIVER - DAY
A gloomy fog overshadows the city with limited visibility

THFT THFT TFHT A choppers propeller slices through the
dense overcast while flying above the East River

It provides a short term AERIAL VIEW of Rikers Island as
Sinatras voice slowly fades away into crackled static --

SINATRA VO

-- It’s up to you New York New
York

END TITLE SEQUENCE
ALL ACTION IS CONTINUOUS IN REAL TIME AND UNCUT

OVER BLACK
Consumed by darkness Pure silence And then --

A steel door SQUEALS open SLAMMING against a concrete wall
Set of metal keys JINGLE out of the lock

The raspy cigarette-laden voice of a MAN speaks His words
are filtered through a radio headset

MAN OS RADIO
You must have really pissed off the
devil to be sent straight to hell

A WOMAN replies in a dauntless tone tangled with shivers
Her voice amplifies in the same radio

WOMAN OS RADIO
I asked to be transferred here
Born and raised in Queens

Heavy footsteps TRUDGE towards you

MAN OS RADIO
Well then welcome home

A switch flips on You FLICKER INTO --

INT RIKERS ISLAND INFIRMARY - STORAGE - DAY

The Woman LAUREN CHASE mid-30s stands before you Attired
in a tee cotton shorts and socks -- all white Hair
twisted in a ponytail Arms crossed to contain body heat

A supply of rubber biosafety suits line the walls behind her
All grouped by color -- Camo green blue red and orange

MAN OS RADIO
I only have one size two left in
blue You’1l be assigned unit
seven thirty A

The Man GUS 50s steps into view Friendly face withered
with age Rubber overalls strapped over his torso He holds
a clipboard of papers in one hand Ballpoint in the other

Gus points directly at you

GUS RADIO
Say hello to your new best friend
Lauren leans down gazing deep into your soul Becomes
apparent that you are the eyes and ears of a blue biosafety
suit’s helmet cam -- You are the 730-A

Gus shoves the clipboard under his arm He grips the 730-A
pulling you down from the hook

SPINNING until you’re looking at Lauren once again She
grabs the shoulders of the suit sizing you up

LAUREN RADIO
It’s heavier than what I’m used to

GUS OS RADIO
The PVC is interlaced with a thick
carbon fiber It provides extra
armor when out in the field

TWISTING left and then right as Gus unscrews the helmet
You DESCEND to the floor and placed on the cold concrete

LAUREN OS RADIO
Have you ever been out there

At ground level you see Lauren step through the 730-A’s
leggings and slide her feet into the connected rubber boots
She does a little jig pulling the suit over her body A
long ZIIIPPPP secures it closed

GUS OS RADIO
Nah I was here doing my release
physical when the shit hit the fan

She grabs the helmet ELEVATED slowly getting a full view
of her suit -- air coupler on the left hip zipper diagonally
across the torso and 730-A stenciled in ink on the chest

Once again you stare right into Lauren’s eyes
GUS OS RADIO
Perfect timing wouldn’t you say

Haven’t even left this building
since

ASCENDING above ROTATING one hundred eighty degrees
Pulling you DOWN over Lauren’s head now looking at Gus

Gus RADIO
How is it

While wearing the 730-A helmet her voice comes in clearly

LAUREN 0S
It fits perfect
Gus RADIO
Good I’d hate to come all the way
down here for another one Word of
warning They have orders to open
fire on anyone caught outside the
buildings without a suit on

PULLING UP off of Lauren’s head View shifts to chest
height as she holds the helmet under her right arm

You see Gus’s hand scribble notes on his paperwork He peels
the top form off handing it to Lauren

GUS OS RADIO
Youre set to deploy in fifteen
minutes You need to get that
signed by Doctor Greer first

LAUREN OS RADIO
Where can I find him

Gus checks his wristwatch

GUS OS RADIO
He’s usually in his office around
this time Take a right Follow
the hallway through a set of double
doors Then the third door on
the left

LAUREN OS RADIO
Thanks

While remaining at chest level you PROCEED into

CORRIDOR A

Bare concrete walls lead down a lonesome hallway Blinding
fluorescent lights glow atop the polished floor Closed
doors on each side spaced out about twenty-five feet apart

Lauren ADVANCES down the hallway Her reflection is visible
on the floor every other step

AHEAD - A DOCTOR garbed in blue scrubs BARRELS a gurney
through the forward double doors A PATIENT lies strapped
in coughing up blood onto his chest

You STOP as they zoom by lLauren’s curiosity SPINS you
around for a second look And then back on the path

She pushes the doors open walking into
CORRIDOR B

Same as Corridor A but the rooms are open and welcoming
Lauren steps by office one two and then three --

GREER’S OFFICE

You PEEK in through the doorway Filing cabinets lie toppled
over vomiting paperwork across the floor

GREER 50s sits at a metal desk Weary unslept eyes lost
in an outdated New York Times sports page He wears a
biosafety suit similar to Lauren Large angular helmet with
transparent face-shield rests on a stack of medical books

Unknowing that Lauren is there he raises a brown square of
freeze-dried food to his mouth taking a hearty bite

KNOCK KNOCK Greer looks up

LAUREN OS RADIO
Doctor Greer Lauren Chase

You PROGRESS towards the desk At Greer’s level you WATCH
him chomp the food

Lauren reaches out for a handshake Greer wipes crumbs away
from his fingers and gives her hand a firm squeeze

GREER RADIO
Welcome aboard I’m surprised
NEIDL (needle) would loan you to us
right now When’d you get in

LAUREN OS RADIO
About an hour ago

Lauren slides her paperwork across the desk Greer glances
over it quickly signing his name at the bottom

GREER RADIO
Have you ate yet

LAUREN OS RADIO
I had lasagna on the helicopter
ride over

GREER RADIO
Id kill for some lasagna

Greer waves his final bite of food
GREER RADIO
I’ve been stuck with Salisbury
steak for the last three months

Greer reads the paper more thoroughly

GREER RADIO
God damn Admin They always do
this shit to me We’ll need to do
a rapid-fire brief

Greer slides from the desk and pops in the last piece of a
food He grabs his helmet speedwalking to the door

Still under Lauren’s arm you FOLLOW Greer into

CORRIDOR B
He looks back at Lauren

GREER RADIO
You’re going out when we’re done
here Use the restroom now --

LAUREN OS RADIO
-- I’m good

Greer cuts a quick corner You TRACK him into a

SUIT PREP ROOM

A metal examining table is bolted to the floor Coiled air
hoses snake from the ceiling Steel framed doorway leads to
the neighboring room

Greer dictates information that he’s repeated at least a
thousand times

GREER RADIO
Not sure what you’re used to
Here everyone within our command
is color coded by uniform
Virologists biologists and
doctors wear blue

Greer and Lauren SLIDE their helmets on the table Both
stand before you in full view

GREER RADIO
Navi are red They manage GPS on
the missions and know the New York
streets better than Randy McNally
Greer offers a pair of black rubber gloves to Lauren She
accepts sliding her hands deep inside Greer grabs his own
and puts them on

GREER RADIO
Orange suits are for Wheelers
They are the only people authorized
to operate vehicles on the Island

They both snap elastic rubber rings over the base of the
gloves A quick palm check Front - clear Back - clear

GREER RADIO
Gunners wear camouflage Most are
surviving police military and
firemen They handle security at
the facilities and on extractions

Greer grabs the 730-A helmet RISING UP looking at him the
whole time And then LOWERED over Lauren’s head

GREER RADIO
There will be one of each on your
extraction team

Greer disappears behind Lauren CLICK CLICK He returns to
the front reaching under your view CLICK CLICK All four
helmet hooks are secured

You LOOK UP as Lauren reaches for an air hose Then DOWN as
she scrambles to connect the hose to the suit’s coupler

GREER RADIO
That’s just temporary Oh-two
Well fill up in the next room
Can you hook me up

You GLANCE over to the table

Lauren grabs Greer’s helmet and slides it over his head She
reaches around his neck with his face shield mere inches from
you -- CLICK CLICK And then under his chin CLICK CLICK

GREER RADIO
Check test Am I coming in clear

You NOD in reply Greer reaches towards Lauren’s left ear

GREER RADIO
There are two radio frequencies in
your helmet A has a proximal mic
Picks up anything in a ten fifteen
foot range
You hear a CLICK as a knob is twisted

GREER RADIO
The other is connected to the main
control center

Garbled VOICES fade into the radio
VOICE 1 V0O RADIO
I need to get a unit at JAT to

transport a Level Four patient

VOICE 2 V0O RADIO
Dispatching now --

-- CLICK You’re returned to the proximal frequency
Greer walks into the next room

Taking a step to follow but STOPPED -- still connected the
air hose Lauren pops it off the coupler and JOGS into the

POWER and AIR SUPPLY ROOM

LEFT - An abundance of yellow diving cylinders maybe
thousands stocked on an endless row of shelves A rubber
hose extends from each tank’s pillar valve

RIGHT - A massive generator HUMS AC cables tangle down from
a digital meter and gauge system

FORWARD - A closed steel containment door with a biohazard
warning sign “BSL-4 AREA” It’s secured by an access keypad

Greer removes one tank from the storage sitting it on the
floor Then another

GREER RADIO
Extractions typically last an hour
Maximum free air capacity on these
suits are ninety minutes In case
of emergencies there are smaller
backup tanks on the bus

Lauren CROUCHES and connects her suit to the air supply You
hear a rapid BURST of air Then a long HISS like a tire
going flat It fades away as the tank empties

RISING UP as Lauren stands She points to the power station
LAUREN OS

Will I need to load the energy
source
GREER RADIO

New suits come fully charged You
can reload yours in the evening
The battery has about a fifteen
hour lifespan

Greer bypasses Lauren stopping at the containment door
fingers hover above the keypad

GREER RADIO
All internal doors marked with this
sign share the same code --
You WATCH Greer’s fingers BEEP in the code -- 1 8 8 4
GREER RADIO
-- Eighteen eighty-four It’s when
the city purchased the Island
Bolts unlock in the door It automatically pulls open

Lauren FOLLOWS Greer into a

DECONTAMINATION CHAMBER

His

LOOKING AROUND - A series of short metal pipes spike from

the bland concrete walls The floor is constructed of steel

grating A corded handle extends from the ceiling

Another containment door but with a different sign -- Skull
and Crossbones labeled “DANGER - AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY”

LAUREN 0S
Do you know where I’1l be
operating

Greer stands in the center of the room He stretches to
reach the handle A quick jerk pulling it down

GREER RADIO

Youve been placed with extraction
team three fourteen Your Navi
will get the details once you’re
off the Island

Water sprays from the pipes engulfing the room in a thick

cloud of mist

GREER RADIO
Look I’ve read your CDC file many
times I know your residence is in

Jackson Heights and you probably
have friends and family out there

Greer and Lauren raise their arms Lauren ROTATES in circled
steps fifteen degrees at a time Greer is now behind you

GREER OS RADIO
Forget about them

Your view FADES into a blur fully obstructed
GREER OS RADIO

Bringing back someone of special

interest infected or not is

punishable by immediate discharge

That’s a direct order all the way

down from the HHS
The shower stops Water dissolves from the face shield
You’re once again looking at Greer He’s all business
ensuring you understand the terms

GREER RADIO
We’ve all had to make sacrifices --

-- And then --

SNAP TO BLACK

You can’t see anything The only sound comes from leftover
water droplets TRICKLING to the floor

A quick GASP as it --

FLASHES TO BLUE
Ultra-violet lights ZAP on Greer does a close inspection of
your biosafety suit Once finished you SCAN every inch of
his stopping back at his face
Greer twists his helmet’s transmission knob

GREER RADIO

Can I get a vehicle dispatched to
the rear entry of the NIC building

BACK TO BLACK

Darkness once again It doesn’t last long as you --

RETURN TO NORMAL LIGHTING

Greer steps to the containment door He glances back at you

GREER RADIO
Entry doors are monitored by
security Turn away

TURNING LEFT staring at the empty wall
GREER OS RADIO
I’1l assign you a pin code when you

return this afternoon

Greer inputs a code into the keypad Each tapped number
BEEPS --

A locking system unlatches in the door Greer gives it a
hefty shove pushing it open He steps out of the building

You see natural light for the first time Lauren WALKS
through the doorway outside to --

RIKERS ISLAND INFIRMARY - LOADING BAY

Sunlight attempts to pierce through an impenetrable haze
Strong winds whirl trash across a parking lot filled with
abandoned vehicles Some are tagged with a spray-painted X

Greer jogs down a set of concrete steps

GREER RADIO
Don’t have time to give you the
full tour
LOOKING BACK at the infirmary -- a haunting three story

brick building Windows are barred and boarded up

GREER OS RADIO
We use all ten jail buildings on
the Island Everything to the east
is reserved for the uninfected

RIGHT - a series of overturned dumpsters all stuffed with
blood-stained hospital sheets

FORWARD - Greer waits for Lauren at the sidewalk’s edge She
picks up her pace

GREER RADIO
Everything on the west is for
infected isolation and research

LOOKING NORTH over the East River as small waves roll along
the rocky shore A capsized tugboat bobs in the water You
see the shadows of the Bronx’s south area of Longwood
Cylindrical smokestacks stretch into the sky

GREER OS RADIO
The infected are separated into
five levels We do our best to try
to save one through three

You TURN to face Greer again

LAUREN 0S
Wait five We’ve only encountered
four in Boston

GREER RADIO
How long were they alive

LAUREN 0S
A week tops Once they were
comatose from the blood loss they
were euthanized

GREER RADIO
We did the same here until we ran
out of potassium chloride And
then we discovered there’s a second
incubation of the virus

GLANCING over Greer’s shoulder noticing SOMETHING on the
road in the distance -- an oncoming vehicle

GREER OS RADIO
Our ride’s coming I’11 introduce
you to a Level Five first hand

The vehicle an old minivan brakes by the sidewalk Roof

completely chopped off by the jaws of life NASCAR 30s an
out of place country boy sits behind the wheel He wears an
orange biosafety suit with his nickname etched on the sleeve

NASCAR RADIO
Where are we going

Lauren climbs aboard the

VAN

BOUNCING slightly as she adjusts her position She CLICKS
into a seat belt Greer slides on next to her

GREER RADIO
Detox facility five And can you
make it quick

NASCAR RADIO
Quick I’11 show you quick

Nascar STOMPS the gas The van JERKS you a little off
balance Lauren grabs the driver’s seat to hold on

Nascar looks back at you through a mirror taped to the
dashboard Eyes curious but suspicious as he speeds through

RIKERS ISLAND BACK ROADS

Everything becomes a blur as you discover why he’s called
Nascar

LEFT - Razor wired fence surrounds a towering brick
building Sign emblazoned with “RIKERS ISLAND POWER PLANT”

Then the tires SCREECH in a sharp right Nascar’s goal is to
keep it over fifty

RIGHT - A collection of semi trailers Going by too fast
but appears they’re full of lumpy BODYBAGS

Another SCREECH Slamming on the brakes You’re JARRED

AHEAD - A backhoe blocks the road Its OPERATOR sits in the
cabin also wearing an orange biosafety suit

Nascar stands up in the seat and waves his hands

NASCAR RADIO
Get the hell out of our way

The Backhoe Operator cranks a lever Rather moving the boom
rises providing a path for the van Nascar creeps by

RIGHT - A massive hole is carved out of an old baseball
field Rusted fence crests into the ground as if its been
run over by a tank

A dump truck reverses to the hole You’re GLUED to that
truck as the dumping bed angles upwards

A series of DEAD BODIES each wrapped a bloody sheet slides
from the truck They plop into the hole -- a mass grave

In shock Lauren SNAPS to Greer

LAUREN OS
Isn’t there a more humane way to
bury the dead

Nascar cracks a laugh You TURN your attention to him
NASCAR RADIO

Humanity was the first thing to
leave this Island

GREER OS RADIO
We’re not talking about a single
lab rat rejecting a vaccine --

BACK TO Greer

GREER RADIO
-- Casualties pile up by the
hundreds each day We have to make
as much room for the uninfected as
possible

Unable to argue the validity Lauren just looks away

LEFT -- Five separate brick buildings with V-shaped walls
Adjoining corridors connect their vertexes

Nascar slows to a stop outside of the fifth building --

DETOX-5 BUILDING

The lawn was once luscious green grass now full of waist
high weeds and dismal brown Greer slides out of the van

Lauren UNSNAPS the seat belt She climbs down ALL FOCUS
remains on the building

GREER OS RADIO
Wait here We’re going to need
transportation to the deployment
zone after this

NASCAR OS RADIO
Sure thing I’1l keep the meter
running for ya

FLANKING Greer you wade through the lawn of Detox-5

GREER OS RADIO
Our testing procedures follow all
CDC standards

Lauren and Greer stop by the main door It’s glass but
reinforced with latticed steel You instinctively TURN AWAY
as Greer inputs his security code

GREER OS RADIO
There will be a supply of Mosquitos
in your extraction kit

BUZZZZ You LOOK to the door The handle spins downwards
and Greer pushes it open

GREER RADIO
We only accept red If it’s black
they won’t get in The goal for
extractions is to bring back as
Many uninfected people as you can

Greer GUIDES you into

DETOX-5 - ENTRANCE LOBBY

Leather chairs sit overturned in a waiting area Old
stained magazines strewn all over Antique photos of the
Rikers Island Jail hang on the walls

AHEAD - A short hallway forks into a Y The right side
pitch black The left lit brightly You FOLLOW Greer

LEFT FORK - White concrete hallway with barred prison cells
on each side Streaks of blood on everything but the
ceiling It’s grimly silent --

POW An echoed shotgun blast SHAKES you up

LAUREN OS
What was that

Greer steps in front of you and looks into the left hallway
GREER RADIO
More than likely the security unit
Most of them shoot when they get
nervous Hell everyone’s on edge
these days

Greer reaches towards the right side of your helmet CLICK
An LED light flashes on He does the same on his own

You TREAD behind Greer into the darkness of

DETOX-5 - RIGHT HALLWAY

It contains similar jail cells as the left hallway The only
difference there is more blood on the floor

Greer points downward

GREER RADIO
See that line on the floor

DOWN - A yellow line extends in the center of the hallway

GREER OS RADIO
Treat it like a tight-rope above
the Empire State Building

CENTERED on Lauren’s feet as she slides heel to toe on what’s
visible of the yellow line Soles SQUEAK in the blood

GROWLING filters through your radio
A LOUD CLINK like a BODY running full speed into steel

And then another CLINK

RIGHT CELL - Through your light a LEVEL FIVE INFECTED stands
behind the bars Blood stains its tattered clothing Eyes
mouth and nose all hemorrhage Pupils fully dilated
resembling the soulless dark eyes of a hungry shark

GREER OS RADIO
That is a Level Five

Breathing hard it SNARLS at you

GREER OS RADIO
After the brain’s motor sensory is
damaged at Level Four the virus
mutates into a rabid state They
become extremely violent and will
kill anything they can get to
Even their own family

LAUREN 0S
How long does it last

GREER OS RADIO
About a week and then their pulse

tops three hundred Eventually
the heart explodes

The Level Five lunges forward CLINKING into the bars again
You FALL BACK fearing of an attack

BLOODY HANDS reach around your helmet pulling you against
the left cell Lauren SCREAMS

LAUREN OS
One of them’s got me

GREER OS RADIO
I told you to stay on the line

Greer rushes to Lauren’s aid He punches at the hands
yelling at the cell

GREER RADIO
Release her dammit

The Level Five sprints across the right cell CLINK
Stopped by the bars once again

The Hands release their grip around Lauren’s helmet

MOVING BACK as Greer drags you away You LOOK into the
corridor Boots scramble slipping in the blood HANDS
reach out of every visible cell that fade into darkness

Youre pulled into the

DETOX-5 - ENTRANCE LOBBY

LOOKING UP directly at the ceiling as Lauren lies on her
back Greer reaches an arm out

GREER RADIO
Our people aren’t the ones dying
from the virus

Lauren grabs Greer’s hand PULLING UP he helps Lauren back
to her feet

GREER RADIO
It’s from being careless You drop
your guard for a split second it

will kill you

Lauren TREKS behind Greer back to the main door He quickly
punches in the code - The door opens Both return
to the exterior of the

DETOX-5 BUILDING

Nascar remains parked by the sidewalk Lauren and Greer JOG
through the grass Both slide onto the

VAN

Nascar speeds off before Lauren has a chance to secure the
seat belt He looks back at you

NASCAR RADIO
You guys contaminated my ride

GREER RADIO
Tell Williams to put the cleaning
bill on Doctor Greer’s tab

It drives along a

SERVICE ROAD

RIGHT - Junked vehicles set atop each other creating a high-
reaching security wall Remnants of barbwire fences are
coiled at the top

FORWARD - You see the large open asphalt of the

STAFF PARKING LOT

Empty of people but a convoy of New York prison buses sit
parked in a row

You FLASH BY the buses

GREER RADIO
There they are Stop here

Nascar slides sideways by the

RIKERS ISLAND PRISONER BUS 314

This bus has seen its share of action riddled with dents
Blood streaks over the shell New York Corrections painted
in navy blue on the side and “314” on the roof Sixteen
total windows and only half are secured with a steel grate

GREER OS RADIO
Guys This is your assigned Viro
She’s new Show her the ropes
okay

You SLIDE off the van and meet your extraction TEAM These
are THE PEOPLE YOU WILL RELY ON IN ORDER TO SURVIVE

WHEELER 20s a shifty eyed black man operates a wheeled
pressure washer His orange biosafety suit is covered in
gang signs Boxed curly afro consumes most of his helmet

WHEELER RADIO
It’s about time We need to roll
out now

He turns the nozzle towards the bus to wash off the blood
Some of it is so thick it’ll take a sandblaster

NAVI 30s a bookworm brunette in a fire red biosafety suit
looks down at a tablet device She glances up at Lauren
Eyes squint behind a pair of strapped glasses

NAVI RADIO
Hey

GUNNER 40s a beefy muscle head loads a sawed-off shotgun
He wears a military issued Hazmat suit Face hidden by a
black gas mask Dog tags proudly dangle around the neck

GUNNER RADIO
Welcome to the jungle

Greer places a hand on your shoulder You TURN to him

GREER RADIO
Good luck out there

Before Lauren can reply Nascar drives away You watch the
van fade away as it speeds into the Island

TA-TA-TAP Water smacks rubber You look DOWN Wheeler
sprays the blood away from Lauren’s suit

WHEELER 0S RADIO
Unlike him I don’t like blood in
my ride Get on

STEPPING UP as Lauren boards

BUS 314

Ripped leather bench seats on both sides After the first
pair a locked caged barrier separates the rest of the bus
A windowless emergency door dead-ends the rear

You WATCH the door waiting for the next person It’s Navi
She steps up and takes the first seat behind the driver

Lauren bullets a question --

LAUREN OS
Do you know where we’re going

Wheeler stomps up and hops in the driver’s seat

WHEELER RADIO
-- Where are we going Are we
there yet Can you stop so I can
pee Fucking women

NAVI RADIO
They’ve really been pushing
Manhattan in recent weeks
Probably there

LAUREN 0S
Is there any chance of stopping in
Jackson Heights

NAVI RADIO
-- Jackson Heights

Gunner rushes onto the bus He’s all gung-ho marching by
Lauren Shotgun firmly gripped in his gloved hands

LAUREN 0S
It’s only a mile away --

WHEELER RADIO

-- Don’t tell me you’re going to be
one of those or I’1ll leave your
ass here before we even get to the

gate

NAVI RADIO
We have to stick to our orders
Sorry

Wheeler turns a key in the ignition The engine RUMBLES to a
start SLIGHTLY SHAKING as it warms up

WHEELER RADIO

Last person who pulled that shit
his whole team was put on a boat
and told “Good Luck”

Before Lauren can find a seat Gunner slides open the cage
door He glances back at you

GUNNER RADIO
You’1l have to stand rear watch
when we get over the bridge

LAUREN OS
Alone

GUNNER RADIO
Don’t worry --

Gunner pumps the shotgun

GUNNER RADIO
-- Susie Q’s got your back

You SIDE STEP past Gunner and through the cage opening
Under the rear seat you SPOT a closed trunk Lauren rushes
to it and opens the lid

SEARCHING inside -- a few belts of shotgun shells a first
aid kit labeled “Mosquitos” battery packs mini-oxygen
tanks a six shot flare gun and a clamshell cell phone

She grabs the cellphone and opens it Fingers press the
power button but it’s dead

GUNNER OS RADIO
There’s no use for that We rely
on our suit’s transmitter for com

Lauren tosses the phone back in the trunk

LAUREN 0S
I was hoping to call my daughter to
see if she is still alive

Gunner draws a long pause before his response

GUNNER RADIO
We see a lot of casualties out
there If I find a phone on
someone’s person you’ll get it

You GLANCE DOWN at Gunner’s dog tags Aluminum is speckled
with blood Both are mysteriously empty of engravings
Gunner notices you looking He JINGLES the tags in his palm
GUNNER RADIO
There’s no point in having my name
on them anymore No one cares who
we are out there Dead or alive

The bus JOLTS forward and drives through the parking lot You
WATCH Wheeler shift into second gear gaining speed

WARNING
You are about to enter a highly quarantined area of New York
49 are dead 49 are infected

2 are surviving by Any Means Necessary to take YOUR spot

If easily frightened I suggest you stay on the Island
An uneasy silence overtakes the bus interior --

-- BAH-DUMP Like a heart-beat as the six tires roll over an
asphalt separator crack now driving onto the

RIKERS ISLAND BRIDGE
BAH—DUMP

You SLIDE onto a right side seat

BAH—DUMP

You LOOK through an open window Fifty feet below you see
the East River

BAH—DUMP

Hundreds of BODIES float face down in the water Streaks of
blood washes away from their clothes

BAH—DUMP
TAP TAP on your helmet --

You quickly SPIN around Right in your face is the handle of
a wooden Louisville Slugger baseball bat

GUNNER RADIO
Have you ever played Whack-A-Mole

BAH—DUMP

LAUREN 0S
Yeah When I was a kid

GUNNER RADIO

Great You get to relive those

childhood memories today
Lauren reaches out for the bat taking it from Gunner
BAH-DUMP
Gunner points to the open window You LOOK OUT again

GUNNER OS RADIO
If the moles pop their head in you
knock ‘em back out

BAH—DUMP

NAVI OS RADIO
Weve got out first set of orders

That grabs Lauren’s attention She MOVES towards the front
of the bus eager to hear the location

Navi reads from her tablet device

NAVI RADIO
Thirty-first street Seventh
avenue Supply pickup at Penn
Station

Obviously something Wheeler didn’t want to hear He smacks
the steering wheel

BAH—DUMP

WHEELER RADIO
Fuck

LAUREN OS
What What does that mean

WHEELER RADIO
It means we’re going to be blind
for ten minutes loading this piece
of shit

NAVI RADIO
You know we have no choice

BAH-DUMP Gunner STOMPS to the rear of the bus You TURN to
see what’s he’s doing

Gunner digs inside the storage trunk He rises back up with
a handful of shotgun shell belts and begins to strap them
around his waist

GUNNER RADIO
I had three friends do a supply run
to Grand Central last week

BAH-DUMP Over the final separator in the bridge now on

QUEENS - NORTH HAZEN STREET

GUNNER RADIO
They never came back to the Island

Wheeler gears down slowing the bus to a stop
You LOOK through that same open window again

STRAIGHT - A forest weaved of oak and maple trees borders the
road The flash of a WHITE T-SHIRT disappears through the
trees A RUNNER An INFECTED SOMEONE

SLIGHTLY RIGHT - Searching for the Runner All you see is
the Bowery Bay shore deep in the distance The cylindrical
tanks of its water treatment facility appear cracked open
with immense explosion holes

You APPROACH the front of the bus and look FORWARD About
sixty feet ahead the road is blocked by a wheeled brick
wall Wild painted text reads QUARANTINE ZONE

A PLATOON of GATE SOLDIERS too many to count step into
formation in front of the bus Each in a Hazmat suit like
Gunner All aim a high-caliber assault rifle at the wall
Wheeler REVS up the engine

Gunner leans over Lauren’s shoulder to look out

GUNNER RADIO
Let’s rock and roll

A loud BUZZ emits from the wall It slowly draws open

HUNDREDS of PEOPLE rush the opening Some are visually sick
LEVEL FIVES while most are in a straight up panic

POW-PA-POW Gate Soldiers make a hole as they unleash a
flurry of bullets into the Crowd Bodies fall dead

One Soldier waves towards the bus
Wheeler shifts into first He STOMPS the gas with both feet

Lauren FALLS BACK from the force as the bus speeds through
the gate She drops the baseball bat

BA-BUMP BA-BUMP Driving over the fallen bodies

You CLIMB UP and try to regain balance The bat rolls by
Lauren’s feet You LOOK DOWN to grab it Then BACK UP

An INFECTED jumps onto the front brush guard He hangs on
blocking Wheeler’s view Blood flows from all facial
orifices He BANGS a heavy fist on the thick glass

Wheeler jerks the wheel left and then right trying to shake
the Infected off

Gunner aims his shotgun at the windshield

WHEELER RADIO
Are you fucking crazy

GUNNER RADIO
How else are we going to get him
off --

-- SCREEEECH Wheeler SLAMS on the brakes

The Infected flies off of the bus and into the road Force
from the asphalt cracks his skull open He lies there dead

THUMP THUMP in the back section of the bus Gunner points
it out You TURN to see another INFECTED trying to crawl
into an open window

GUNNER OS RADIO
Watch the windows
(to Wheeler)
It’s getting too hot in here Get
us out man

Lauren RUSHES to the rear of the bus and pulls up the
baseball bat WHACK She hits the Infected right in the
face but he’s not giving up HE WANTS IN THIS BUS

Wheeler kicks it back into gear Too late as a FEMALE
INFECTED tries to climb in the opposite side

Lauren swings again THUD He’s still progressing now
halfway into the bus

LAUREN OS
Help He’s not giving up I need
help

Gunner snaps into the killing mood He starts to hum and
sing CCR’s “Susie Q”

GUNNER OS RADIO
Oh Susie Q Ohhh Susie Q

You SEE Gunner take aim with his shotgun at the Infected --

-- BOOM Blood spatters everywhere The Infected’s dead
body hangs in the window Gunner STOMPS his boot kicking it
out He PUMPS another shell in the shotgun

GUNNER RADIO
Oh Susie Q baby I love you
Susie Q

Lauren MOVES to the other side and swings at the Female
Infected PLUNK First contact is a home run She loses
her grip and falls out of the window

Gunner continues humming Susie Q

NAVI OS RADIO
Turn right

A sharp right THROWS you into the seats as Wheeler turns onto

19TH AVENUE

Shade briefly consumes the bus interior from bordering trees
and industrial buildings

NAVI OS RADIO
Now a left

Wheeler shoots a hard left onto

49TH STREET

You PULL UP in the aisle steadying yourself as the bus gears
into third

WHEELER 0S RADIO

Gunner slides into the seat across from you

GUNNER RADIO
Are you okay

WHAM Gunner slides up continuing his song

GUNNER RADIO
Like the way you walk

Gunner leans over you

WHAM

GUNNER OS RADIO
We’ve got a rogue vehicle

You LOOK OUT THE WINDOW sparks fly from ground metal as a
pickup truck SLAMS into the side of the bus THREE INFECTEDS
surf on the truck bed balancing for a jump

GUNNER OS RADIO
Like the way you talk --

An INFECTED dives at the bus clinging onto the open window

LAUREN OS
Get out

Lauren jabs the baseball bat at the Infected’s fingers

GUNNER OS RADIO

emergency door

GUNNER RADIO
-- Susie Q
(normal tone)
Get some speed

WHEELER 0S RADIO
I’m red-lining at seventy Going
any faster will blow the engine

GUNNER RADIO
Then shake ‘em off

The bus jerks right THROWING you against the open window
You get a full view outside -- Apartment buildings victims of
rampage Bricks cracked Windows shattered Vehicles
wildly parked all over the sidewalks

Eyes FOLLOW the pursuing truck through the windows as it
lingers behind the bus

The truck speeds up again a few feet from the rear door An
INFECTED crawls atop the roof sliding to the hood It makes
a solid effort to JUMP INTO THE BUS but --

-- BOOM Gunner shoots him down His body rolls over the
truck’s hood

NAVI OS RADIO
Oh shit

LAUREN 0S
What

WHEELER 0S RADIO
Which way do I turn

SPINNING FORWARD - Up ahead a series of road cones and
orange construction signs block the path

NAVI RADIO
The bridge is out over Grand
Central Parkway

WHEELER RADIO
Get these guys off my ass or
they’1ll push us off the road

SPINNING BACK - The last Infected on the truck attempts the
same maneuver Gunner takes aim and then shifts the
crosshairs to the DRIVER

BOOM Buckshot spiderwebs long cracks in the windshield’s
glass Blood BURSTS within the interior The Driver falls
limp over the steering wheel HONKING the HORN

GUNNER RADIO
All secure oh Susie-Q baby I
love you Susie-Q

NAVI OS RADIO
There’s a pedestrian bridge Try
that

Wheeler takes a quick left to

ASTORIA BLVD NORTH

Throwing you against the open window again Looking out you
WATCH the pursuing truck FLY over the road and CRASH into a
concrete containing wall below It bursts into flames

A sharp right pulls you AWAY from the window

SHREEE --- SQUEEEEEEEEL

Sparks engulf the whole bus as it attempts to squeeze through
a narrow metal pedestrian overpass

THA-DUMP bouncing onto

ASTORIA BLVD SOUTH

Wheeler struggles to regain control as the bus hops over a
tall curb CRASHING through a chain fence into --

ST MICHAELS CEMETERY

BAH BAH BAH BAH BUMP -- Granite tombstones are demolished
Stone debris SPLASHES atop the bus

WHEELER 0S RADIO
Get me back on the road

NAVI OS RADIO

over another curb and returns to

49TH STREET
Everyone breathes a sigh of relief Navi pumps a fist

NAVI RADIO GUNNER RADIO
Wooo Hell yeah

LAUREN (0S
It’s all over right

WHEELER RADIO
You are new aren’t you

LAUREN 0S
This is the first time I’ve
witnessed anything this bad

GUNNER RADIO
It’s never over It’s a war
anytime we leave the Island
People are finding their way to the
safe zone and making the exits
more difficult

NAVI RADIO
We’ve got two miles until the
expressway and about four to the
destination

A QUICK FLASH of shade fills the bus as it drives under a
train trussell bridge

Navi spins in her seat leaning over to talk to Lauren

NAVI RADIO
Where did you come from

LAUREN 0S
They sent me from Boston

GUNNER OS RADIO
Bah-sten

LAUREN OS
I was working with doctors on a
vaccine for the virus

WHEELER RADIO
So if we get infected out here you
can heal us

NAVI RADIO
Don’t jinx us No one’s getting
infected

Gunner PLOPS down in one of the adjacent seats He unsnaps
his face masks and lets it dangle over his chest Sweat
rolls from his buzzed haircut

You LOOK to Gunner

GUNNER RADIO
Don’t worry I’11 put it back on

Then BACK TO Wheeler

LAUREN 0S
No We never had any success
Couldn’t even contain it much less
stop it

Everyone turns blank with an “all hope is lost” stare on
their face Lauren attempts to sound more encouraging though
it sounds robotic Something she’d say in a news report

LAUREN 0S
But we were making great strides
every day

NAVI RADIO
You said you had have a
daughter I have a son

LAUREN OS
Is he safe on the Island

NAVI RADIO
No His father took him on a trip
to Niagara Falls They were never
allowed back into the States I’m
hoping they’re still alive --

WHEELER RADIO
-- they’re dead

NAVI RADIO
Not everyone is a soulless asshole
with no reason for living okay
Some of us need something to look
forward to Something to get us to
tomorrow

WHEELER RADIO
And some of us need to get back to
work What am I doing here I’m
running out of road

Navi looks down at her tablet Then through the windshield
NAVI RADIO
Follow it around this building

then take a left

Wheeler pulls the wheel towards the right Then a quick spin
left driving onto

48TH STREET

LAUREN OS
What were you doing before the
attack

NAVI RADIO
Working at a florist in Manhattan
I was a delivery manager sending
flowers around the city I’m even
a product of the extractions

Island

You slowly TURN to Gunner He wipes sweat from his face

GUNNER RADIO
I was with the NYPD

WHEELER 0S RADIO
Bullshit Go ahead and tell her
what you really were

GUNNER RADIO
I was in the safety division --

WHEELER RADIO
-- You were a crossing guard at a
fucking elementary school

Gunner’s fingers tease the trigger of his shotgun

GUNNER RADIO
You know what Every time I’ sent
out with you I get a step closer
to blowing your brains out

WHEELER RADIO
Go ahead and try I’11 leave you
all out in the city

NAVI RADIO
Stop guys We have to rely on each
other to make it back alive

GUNNER RADIO

Wheeler mockingly cuts in

WHEELER RADIO
-- Hey It doesn’t matter what we

Navi points ahead

NAVI RADIO
It’s going to get tricky up here
Roosevelt Greenpoint and Queen’s
Boulevard all fork You need to
get on Greenpoint It’1ll take us
straight to the expressway

Another FLASH of shade as the bus drives under a longer train
bridge And then a slight right turning onto

GREENPOINT AVENUE

NAVI RADIO
It will be about a mile until we
hit four ninety-five

You LOOK out of a side window Small businesses and shops
line the sidewalk All with front windows broken out -- A
Sporting Goods Store Subway restaurant Clothing Store and
a Coffee Shop

You PULL back into the bus

LAUREN OS
There aren’t many people out

WHEELER RADIO
There aren’t many people alive

NAVI RADIO
A lot of them stick around
hospitals churches --

GUNNER RADIO
-- And parking garages

WHEELER RADIO
Yeah They treat those fucking
things like hotels

Wheeler turns his attention back to the road He SLAMS on
the brakes

WHEELER RADIO
What the fuck is this

NAVI RADIO
She’s not bleeding and she doesn’t
look sick

Lauren MOVES FORWARD to the front You SEE a TEEN GIRL
standing in the middle of the street She flails her arms
signaling for help Oddly she doesn’t move towards the bus

GUNNER RADIO
It’s your time to shine doc

Gunner straps into his toxic mask

WHEELER RADIO
We don’t have time for this man

GUNNER RADIO
I’m not letting a helpless teenager
die out here alone

Lauren runs to the rear of the bus She pops open the trunk
You LOOK DOWN as her hands rush to open the first aid kit

It’s full of round plastic packs that resemble birth control
pill cases They have about thirty small buttons around the
circle This is the Mosquito

Lauren RISES UP on a mission to the front of the bus

GUNNER RADIO
Ill provide cover

WHEELER RADIO
Remember the rules

Lauren NODS in reply and then HOPS DOWN the steps The first
time out of the bus now standing at

43RD STREET 47TH AVENUE

RIGHT - Vehicles abandoned in the street DEAD BODIES
scattered around left in a pool of their own blood A
busted fire hydrant spouts brownish water

Deep in the distance you see the greyed silhouette of the
Empire State Building

UP - Blank traffic lights sway in the breeze

The Teen YELLS for your help at the top of her lungs but
filtered through the radio it sounds like faint whispers

TEEN OS MUFFLED
Help me Please

Lauren APPROACHES the Teen cautiously

Gunner rushes by your side He maintains a vigilant watch on

an empty corner playground -- Noonan Park
TEEN RADIO
Please get me out of here I’m not
sick

LAUREN 0S
I still have to check

You look DOWN into Lauren’s hand as she presses a button on
the Mosquito A small needle springs out Cotton surrounds
the metal below the tip It drips with a clear chemical

LAUREN 0S
This will be no worse than a bee
sting Okay

The Teen grows more frantic

TEEN RADIO
Just get me out of here They --

LAUREN 0S
-- Calm down We have to do this
before you can get on the bus

Lauren POKES the needle into the Teen’s flesh The Teen
winces Blood bubbles from the hole Lauren presses the
same button disconnecting the needle

You wait and WATCH the blood soak the cotton
GUNNER OS RADIO
Well Is she clean

The Teen’s blood maintains the red color

LAUREN 0S
Yeah She’s fine

GUNNER RADIO
Everything’s going to be okay
We’ll get you back to safety --

-- Gunner grabs the Teen’s arm He pulls to
but she’s stuck

DOWN - The Teen’s ankle is cuffed to a sewer cover
heavy for her just to walk away
Gunner whispers
GUNNER OS RADIO
Start moving It’s a trap
LAUREN 0S
Wait What are you talking about
GUNNER RADIO
Someone’s using her as bait
PANNING around the intersection -- A six-story brick

apartment building The street to the east

TEEN OS MUFFLED
Please don’t let them kill me

Too

The remnants
an Italian restaurant The street to the south --

BANG BANG Gunshots ECHO from the plastic playground

BOOM Gunner’s shotgun FIRES

Lauren DIVES onto the bus steps You SPIN around in the

doorway to see Gunner reloading the shotgun

WHEELER 0S RADIO
Come on man we need to get the
fuck out of here

FIVE INFECTEDS appear from behind playground equipment in the
park Each climb over the metal surrounding fence

CLICK BOOM One INFECTED down as Gunner fills it with
buckshot PUMP BOOM Another INFECTED down

The bus CREEPS away from the intersection You see the Teen
reach out for Lauren one last time

TEEN RADIO
Take me with you

Lauren CLIMBS UP and WALKS through the bus She LOOKS out
the windows as Gunner sprints along its side The bus moves
too fast for him He soon trails behind

REAR - Out of the emergency door Gunner chases the bus The
three Infecteds sprint in pursuit

Lauren SLIDES DOWN reaching out for Gunner His breathing
becomes so heavy you can hear it through the radio

LAUREN (0S
Slow down He can’t make it

WHEELER 0S RADIO
We can’t stop Who knows what’s
around here

Gunner tosses his shotgun to Lauren You catch it RISING UP

LOOKING THROUGH THE SIGHTS

Lauren SHAKES while taking aim at an Infected She pulls the
trigger -- BOOM

Force KICKS YOU DOWN on the bus floor You LOOK out of the
doorway Still three Infecteds running -- Must have missed

Gunner gets a burst of adrenaline He dives into the back of
the bus Lauren grabs his arms helping pull him in

LAUREN 0S
He’s in Go go go

Wheeler kicks it into high gear

WHEELER 0S RADIO
We need to get the hell off of
these back roads How far is it to
the highway

NAVI OS RADIO
Quarter of a mile

LAUREN 0S
Why would they use a young girl
like that She was uninfected

WHEELER 0S RADIO
Welcome to the world we live in
People are doing whatever it takes
find a ride back to Rikers

NAVI RADIO

Think of it like being underwater
Holding your breath it’s fine
Once you reach that breaking point
youll do anything to get back to
the top before you die

Lauren slides into a seat and LOOKS out of the left bus
window --

A ROMAN CATHOLIC PRIEST attends to an INFECTED in front of
St Rafael’s Church His white Vestment covered in blood
The man of God fearless of this plague waves at you

WHEELER 0S RADIO
Starting to see signs for the four
ninety-five Where to go

NAVI RADIO
Take a right

Wheeler hits a sharp turn sliding onto

BORDEN AVENUE

Your view SLOPES DOWN with the on ramp Lauren holds on to
the seat in front of her

WHEELER RADIO
Where’s the fucking road It’s
blocked

NAVI OS RADIO
It should be up here

LEFT - Out the window you see a blur of a brick wall --
-- And then a low clearance bridge A Group of PEOPLE flock
out of the darkness and run towards the bus Too slow they

quickly disappear

FORWARD - Navi checks her tablet Finger slides over the
screen

NAVI RADIO
Shit We missed the turn The
highway’s up there

Navi points upwards

WHEELER RADIO
Find a way to get there

NAVI RADIO
I’m working on it Take another
right

WHEELER RADIO
It’s a one way road

GUNNER RADIO
The streets are empty Does it
matter

Wheeler spins the wheel in a right turn to

VAN DAM STREET

He follows the lane for a LOOOONG rounded turn It finally
evens out as the bus drives on to the

QUEENS MIDTOWN EXPRESSWAY

AHEAD - Clear roads with no vehicles across the six lanes

WHEELER RADIO
Fucking finally

NAVI RADIO
It’s smooth sailing from here

GUNNER RADIO
Yeah --

Gunner readies more shells in his shotgun

GUNNER RADIO
-- Until we hit downtown Then
another shit storm to wade through

LAUREN 0S
What’s the plan for when we get to
Penn Station

WHEELER RADIO
We get in Grab our shit Then
get the fuck out
NAVI RADIO
I’1l check what we’re picking up

Navi reads from her tablet

NAVI RADIO
Ten buckets of food Two boxes of
medical supplies One hundred
gallons of water Twenty jugs
total All located in the central
corridor elevator

WHEELER RADIO
Shit Sounds like it will take
more than ten minutes

GUNNER RADIO
Which level

NAVI RADIO
Ground level

LAUREN OS
What about picking up the
uninfected people

WHEELER RADIO
You’re on the wrong team for that
I’m not picking up a damn person
after getting ambushed back there

LAUREN 0S
I was told that’s our purpose To
find uninfected people and bring
them back to the Island

WHEELER RADIO
You saw what happened when we tried
that good samaritan shit for one
person This bus sits twenty
Multiply that by five for the crazy
motherfuckers coming out of the
woodwork

LAUREN 0S
Then why are we doing this

GUNNER RADIO
Food

LAUREN 0S
Food I saw food supplies on the
island

GUNNER RADIO
That’s not for us

WHEELER RADIO

We have to earn our stay These
missions are our only way to get
food and water I haven’t ate in
nine days --

NAVI RADIO
Seven here

GUNNER RADIO
Ten

WHEELER RADIO
Not all of us live in the first
class quarters of the infirmary

FORWARD - The toll lanes for the Queens Midtown Tunnel

WOOOSH The bus narrowly speeds through the brick columns
and into the

QUEENS MIDTOWN TUNNEL - WESTBOUND LANE

Electrical power is out An emergency light shines every few
hundred feet Wheeler flips on the bus headlights It looks
like an easy ride until --

WHEELER RADIO
Shiiitt

Wheeler grips the wheel tight as he slams on the brakes Bus
slides sideways with the rear scraping against the wall

AHEAD - Abandoned vehicles block the path Enough room for a
motorcycle to squeeze through but definitely not the 314

WHEELER RADIO
Why didn’t you pick this up

NAVI RADIO
All I have is a map of the city
not a god damn traffic report

LAUREN OS
So do we walk from here

WHEELER RADIO
Fuck you It’s a mile long tunnel
I knew we should have took the
fifty-ninth street bridge

NAVI RADIO
This tunnel is a straight shot to
Penn Station If we had taken the
bridge wed have to go through
Time Square And that is a fucking
warzone

GUNNER RADIO
The fifty ninth has been out for a
week The army finally received
orders to destroy it

WHEELER RADIO
Fuck They really are isolating

the Island from the rest of the
world --

You maintain focus on the FRONT while they argue A DOZEN
INFECTEDS emerge from the blocking cars Some carry homemade
melee weapons Some with guns

LAUREN OS
-- Guys We’re not alone here

Wheeler and Navi look ahead --
An ASSAULT of bullets PLUNK off the bus
Lauren DIVES on the bus floor to take cover

WHEELER 0S RADIO
Relax It’s bulletproof glass

More BULLETS begin to crack the dense glass
GUNNER OS RADIO
Not if fifty bullets hit it Get

us out of here

Wheeler kicks it into reverse A warning signal persistently
BEEPS Back-up lights illuminate the rear

You WATCH through the emergency door as the bus exits the
tunnel returning to the

QUEENS MIDTOWN EXPRESSWAY

NAVI OS RADIO
Try the other lane

SPINNING AROUND in a twisted turn by the bus It CRASHES
into a digital road sign

Wheeler regains control He shifts back into first

NAVI OS RADIO
They’re coming out of the tunnel

Gunner steps over Lauren -- CLICK BOOM You SEE a shotgun
shell bounce on the floor

The bus shoots into the safety of the

QUEENS MIDTOWN TUNNEL - EASTBOUND LANE

No emergency lighting in this one Completely dark except
for the headlights

Lauren RISES UP taking a deep breath

LAUREN 0S
Jesus this city is nuts

NAVI RADIO
Just wait ‘til we’re in Manhattan

A feint WIIISHHHH is heard outside of the bus

LAUREN OS
What’s that noise

WHEELER RADIO

Water

AHEAD - The tunnel is full of water about a foot deep It
cascades atop the fenders

GUNNER OS RADIO
I’m guessing the tunnel’s about go
down soon

A SHADOWY FIGURE comes in to view and then --

THUMP It’s flung from the front brush guard and bounces
against the tunnel wall

GUNNER OS RADIO
What the hell was that

Gunner rushes by Lauren to look out the windshield

WHEELER RADIO
A tunnel rat

GUNNER RADIO
Must have been a god damn big rat --
44

-- CLANG Metal on metal

Windshield SHATTERS SPARKS fly Everyone PANICS
SHHRRIIPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP

You DUCK DOWN as a fallen ceiling structure slices through
the right side of the bus inches away from decapitating

Lauren

WHEELER 0S RADIO

Fuck
NAVI OS RADIO
Stop the bus
WHEELER 0S RADIO GUNNER 0S RADIO
Hell no I see daylight

You PEEK OVER the seat but continue to lay low fearful of
another structure

WHEELER RADIO
There’s something blocking the
road

LAUREN OS
What is it

NAVI RADIO
Looks like a car

WHEELER RADIO
I’m not stopping this time

AHEAD - As the bus speeds forward it slowly fills with
daylight You see a hatchback parked sideways in the middle
of the tunnel exit

GETTING CLOSER TO IMPACT A DEAD BODY sits behind the wheel --

CRASH

The bus BULLDOZES the car pushing it through the last fifty
feet of the tunnel And then they hit --

MANHATTAN - EAST 36TH STREET

Wheeler doesn’t let up on the gas He spins the wheel to the
left guiding the hatchback --

-- BAM into a light pole It SMASHES down over the bus
embedding itself in the hood

Wheeler gears into reverse He goes back enough to shake off
the pole Then forward continuing on the westbound lane

WHEELER 0S RADIO
Welcome to Manhattan

You LOOK OUT of the open bus window DEAD BODIES litter the
sidewalk The first level windows and doors of all buildings
are boarded up “Hello Cruel World” is tagged in red on a
wall Could be paint but it’s probably blood

As the bus crosses

36TH STREET 3RD AVENUE

You see trees overturned Endless lines of abandoned
vehicles mostly yellow cabs A pair of ADULTS aimlessly
walking the streets They flag their arms trying to grab
your attention --

-- And then your view is blocked once again by towering
apartment buildings

GUNNER OS RADIO
It’s insane huh

Gunner slides in the seat forward of Lauren He looks out

LAUREN 0S
Yeah I’ve only heard stories
about how bad it was I could have
never imagined this

WHEELER 0S RADIO
I need to know where to go --

NAVI OS RADIO
-- We’re on thirty-sixth We need
to get on thirty-fourth Take the
next left you get

WHEELER 0S RADIO
If I put on the turn signal you
think anyone would notice

The bus begins to turn onto

LEXINGTON AVENUE

Gunner spots something on the street ahead You WATCH him
slide up and approach the driver’s seat

GUNNER RADIO
Stop the bus

WHEELER RADIO
Stop the bus We’re almost there
Sit down and fucking wait --

QUT THE WINDOW - You see what caught Gunners attention -- A
prison bus similar to the 314 turned on its right side
Huge dent from a massive collision embedded in the left

FORWARD - Gunner jabs the barrel of his shotgun against
Wheeler’s helmet

GUNNER RADIO
Either this bus stops moving or
you do

Wheeler slows by the curb He raises his hands in surrender

WHEELER RADIO
Thirty seconds And I’m gone

You WATCH Gunner stomp through the bus and hop out of the
emergency exit He continues up Lexington Avenue His
breathing labors like a man about to go irate or cry It
slowly fades from the radio as he walks out of range

Gunner disappears into the crashed bus
FOCUSED Waiting --

SOMETHING grab’s Lauren’s legs Before she can see what it
is you’re THROWN to the floor

LAUREN OS
Help

NAVI OS RADIO
Oh shit Go help her

WHEELER 0S RADIO
My ass isn’t leaving this seat
You help her

You ROLL OVER and see Navi’s feet rush towards you Lauren
desperately reaches for her but --

LAUREN RADIO
HELP

THUD Lauren lands hard on the pavement

Lauren is DRAGGED ACROSS the street A full view of cracked
asphalt flashes before you and then --

TWO INFECTEDS TURN Lauren on her back They hover over you
completely enveloping your view

STRAIGHT UP - Blood drips from their black eyes like tears
More spews from their nose and mouth Both GRUNT as they
fight to tear through Lauren’s suit

SHAKING as an Infected grabs the helmet He tugs with all
his strength but it’s locked and not coming off

ZIIPPPPPPPPP The other unzips Lauren’s suit

Lauren kicks and screams in total horror but shes too
vulnerable --

WEEEOH-PFFTITTT A flash of red as a road flare bounces by
Laurens head

THROUGH THE CHAOS you see Navi in the bus Flare gun
gripped tight in her hand She fires another one --

WEEEOH-PFFTTTT A direct hit on an Infected but theyre not
giving up They return all focus on Lauren obstructing your
view again

CLICK BOOM Both Infecteds fall dead atop of Lauren Two
for the price of one

A boot pushes one Infected off Then the other You SEE
Gunner standing above you He carries a second sawed-off

shotgun identical to his own Three pairs of dog tags
wrapped around its barrel -- these have a name

A sniffle is heard in the radio as Gunner reaches for
Laurens hand He pulls her UP back to her feet

ZIIIIPPPP to secure the suit shut again

LAUREN OS
God that was close

Gunner hops back on the bus Lauren CRAWLS UP

LAUREN 0S
Thank you

Wheeler drives away continuing on Lexington Avenue

WHEELER RADIO
That was some serious hero shit
bro But next time I’m not
sticking around for it

NAVI RADIO
What did you see in there

Gunner plops down on a seat

GUNNER RADIO
They were all dead Mutilated

LEXINGTON AVENUE 35TH STREET

NAVI RADIO
I’m sorry

Gunner pumps the shotgun with the dog tags His voice fueled
with vengeance

GUNNER RADIO
Im killing anyone I see on these
streets Infected or not

WHEELER RADIO
That’s the attitude you need to
have out here You’re a soldier

NAVI RADIO
Take the next right and then it’s
a few blocks away

LAUREN RADIO
Isnt that a little selfish

WHEELER RADIO
When it gets this bad its no
longer the survival of the fittest
Its survival of the smartest

LAUREN 0S
Nice theory How have you survived
this long

Wheeler glares at you through the overhead drivers mirror
He spins the wheel right now turning onto

34TH STREET

All along this street shadows flicker in and out due to
variant sizes of the buildings Wheeler drives at full
throttle ZIPPING through abandoned vehicles

NAVI RADIO
I’ve got a map of Penn Station

You HUDDLE over Navi’s shoulder A diagram of Penn Station’s
first level displays on the tablet screen Her gloved
fingers point out the route

NAVI RADIO
We enter through the seventh avenue
entrance --

Navi taps the left side of the screen

NAVI RADIO

-- And we stay to the left The
supplies are in this elevator
Next to customer service Here

LAUREN 0S
Wait I’m lost How do the
supplies even get out here

34TH STREET PARK AVENUE

WHEELER RADIO
The same way they got to you in
Boston

LAUREN 0S

No one ever delivered anything to
us We have a quarantine warehouse
stocked below our facility

GUNNER RADIO
In the first month they were using
choppers from LaGuardia to deliver
supplies to Rikers Island

LAUREN 0S

Yeah when they converted the
prison into the research facility
I saw that on the last few news
broadcasts

GUNNER RADIO
Then they started to ration the
fuel we had to do these runs to
the airport instead

WHEELER RADIO
In an armored SWAT truck That
bitch was hard as hell to drive

34TH STREET MADISON AVENUE

NAVI RADIO
They’re moving further away from
the Island each time

GUNNER RADIO
The Army started dumping loads off
in random areas of the city for us
to pick up And the bigwigs at the
CDC thought it would be best that
we picked up as many uninfected
people we could fit in the bus --

WHEELER RADIO
-- Which I still think is bullshit

LAUREN 0S
Why is that We’re trying to
preserve what’s left of the city

WHEELER RADIO
Youre a fresh fish You dont
know how the system works yet

LAUREN OS
So how does it work Enlighten me

34TH STREET 5TH AVENUE

BUM-BUM-BUM-BUMP like driving over a row of speed bumps at
full speed Koreatown is a mass grave in the street
HUNDREDS of DEAD BODIES lying all over Wheeler drives over
them without a care

WHEELER RADIO
Were not coming out here to pick
up the uninfected Were picking
up guinea pigs

NAVI RADIO
Oh god not this conspiracy shit
again

WHEELER RADIO
Its not about saving the race
Its about racing to save The
doctors only care about who creates
the vaccine first Us Japan
France Whoever Once they run
out of those to test theyll turn
to us

LAUREN 0S
Ive worked directly with CDC
doctors and thats not the case

WHEELER RADIO
Then what is the case Enlighten
us about this thing What will
happen next

Navi and Gunner both look to Lauren for an answer

LAUREN OS
I I don’t know

34TH STREET 6TH AVENUE

NAVI RADIO
We’re coming up on it soon Only a
block away Take the next left

GUNNER RADIO
Just drop it No one knows what
will happen next Not you Not
me Not even God

WHEELER RADIO
When if you get back to the
Island today go around to the
other buildings Take the tour
All of the uninfected live in the
pink building The sick ones
overflow all the rest

NAVI RADIO
Slow down or you’1ll miss the turn

Wheeler turns left at the intersection now driving on to

7TH AVENUE
Navi points ahead

NAVI RADIO
Up there Under that roof is the
main entrance

Wheeler gears down The bus stops slightly diagonal in the
street The interior is filled with a dark shadow from the
neighboring building -- Madison Square Garden

Wheeler shuts down the engine He pulls the keys from the
ignition and darts from the bus Navi follows leaving her
tablet in the seat

You FOLLOW Gunner out of the bus to

PENN STATION

He keeps a vigilant watch on the streets like before with a
shotgun in each hand

UP - The towering side wall of Madison Square Garden A
tall Jeremy Lin Knicks banner flaps in the breeze

RIGHT - North up Seventh Avenue a row of yellow cabs sit
parked by the curb Most with their windows busted out and
covered in blood

More abandoned vehicles in the distance but they appear
plowed to one side of the road

ACROSS THE STREET - Limbs of crushed DEAD BODIES extend
underneath the fallen canopy of the Pennsylvania Hotel
Though a grim sight the hotel’s four American flags continue
to proudly fly on their columns

FORWARD - Towards the station A mix between DEAD BODIES and
bags of trash line the sidewalk The main doors to the
station are broken off

Everything seems to be frozen in time

Lauren walks toward the entrance and into

PENN STATION - LOWER LEVEL

Slightly dim with the only light source coming from east
facing windows Shop doors are drawn closed Restaurants
and food stores victims of riots Escalators powered off
More BODIES everywhere across the floor

No sign of Gunner Wheeler or Navi

LAUREN OS
Hey Guys

No response
Lauren WALKS through the station Stopping to look UP --

The train timetable No destinations No arrivals

Lauren SPINS around in search mode She grows anxious

Navi finally comes into the frequency

NAVI OS RADIO
Where are you

LAUREN 0S
I’m at the timetable

NAVI OS RADIO
Come around the corner We need
your help

Lauren JOGS through the station and around the corner to spot
the team standing by a closed dual-door metal elevator

Wheeler points to you and Gunner

WHEELER RADIO
You two on one side Me and her on
the other

Gunner places his fingers in the crack of the elevator door
Lauren does the same Soon after Wheeler and Navi grip the
opposite door

Eight hands pulling with all their might --

Wheeler’s fingers slip He falls backwards The door
doesn’t move an inch

WHEELER RADIO
We can’t do with the gloves on
There’s no way

NAVI RADIO
We can’t take them off

WHEELER RADIO
Look around you They’re all dead

Gunner approaches Lauren

GUNNER RADIO
Can we catch this virus from dead
people

LAUREN OS
Only HIV has been proven to survive
with a deceased host and that’s
only during refrigeration --

SNAP SNAP Enough for Wheeler as he pulls the gloves off
Navi snaps hers off Same with Gunner Lauren hesitates

LAUREN RADIO
I prefer to keep mine on

Everyone gives a second attempt to pull the door open
Fingers turn white with pressure It opens an inch They
get more leverage and it fully opens All but Lauren rush in

Lauren tries to look in the elevator but the others obstruct
your view They treat these supplies like people lost in the
desert who have just found an oasis

Gunner rolls an overused dented five-gallon jug of water
from the elevator He drops one shotgun to the floor by
Lauren’s feet and uses the other to bust open the top

Gunner tips the jug over It freely leaks out on the floor
He snaps the mask off and drops to his knees Cups his hands
to collect water Then raising for a well-needed drink

GUNNER RADIO
You want any

Lauren SHAKES her head no in response

Wheeler carries out a grey bucket labeled “100ct SALISBURY
STEAK MRE” He and Navi rip the top off Bags loaded inside

Navi and Wheeler twist their helmets off tossing them to the
side They grab a bag and tear it open with their teeth

LAUREN 0S
I think I’m going to walk around
and check out the area
Lauren BENDS DOWN grabbing the shotgun by her feet

Wheeler speaks with his mouth full of freeze dried steak

WHEELER RADIO
Don’t go too far We’1ll need your
help loading bus
Navi tosses Lauren a bag of food

NAVI RADIO
Just in case you get hungry

Lauren stashes the bag in her suit’s pocket

She distances herself from the group A finger on the
trigger hand on the pump

Lauren FOCUSES on the floor She stops for a second at each
DEAD BODY as if she is profiling that person

A BLONDE TEEN lies dead in an awkward position Face covered
in dried blood with the eyes open Pink Versace handbag
clutched in her fingers Material goods don’t matter now

Lauren grabs the purse She dumps the contents on the floor -
- lip gloss makeup tampons change bag and a cellphone

She instantly snags the phone Fingers press the on buttons
but nothing even flickers on the screen

UP - On an escalator a FAT MAN also dead lies on the top
step Baggy cargo shorts barely hang on his blood covered
body An older model cellphone lies next to his hand

Lauren tosses the Blonde Teen’s phone on the floor and JOGS
up the escalator to the

SECOND LEVEL

DOWNSTAIRS - Navi Gunner and Wheeler continue to devour
their rations definitely not leaving hungry

ESCALATOR - Lauren snatches the cell from the Fat Man It
has power but an empty battery logo flashes on the screen

She tries to dial a number but with the gloved fingers it
presses three at a time

Lauren SCANS the area stopping at a sign over a pair of
double doors -- “MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - EAST ENTRANCE” She
runs over and huddles in the doorway

You LOOK into Lauren’s right hand She slowly turns the
glove After a tense sigh she unravels it from her hand

Fingers quickly dial the number again -- 718 305 4872

Lauren tugs the right sleeve pulling the phone into her
biosafety suit Through the radio you can barely hear it

RING RING

LAUREN OS
Come on Please pick up

RINGING --

The voice of Lauren’s daughter MEGAN 16 answers the call
She’s full of pep and energy

MEGAN V0
Hey It’s about time you called

LAUREN 0S
Shit

Lauren knows that it’s only a recording

MEGAN V0

BEEP

LAUREN 0S
Megan I don’t have much time

Something rustles on the other end of the line Megan picks
up the call mid-message Her voice totally opposite of the
message Tired with words slurred together

MEGAN V0
Hel hello

LAUREN OS
Megan

MEGAN V0
Mom

LAUREN OS

Megan COUGHS a few times

MEGAN V0
It hurts so bad

LAUREN OS

LAUREN OS

You can fight through it --

BLIP The cellphone dies

NAVI OS RADIO
Hey what are you doing up here
Slightly surprised you TURN to see Navi She’s still
without her hood

LAUREN 0S
I found a phone and called my
daughter She’s still alive

NAVI RADIO
That’s great news --

Lauren extends the phone out of her suit Navi quickly
snatches it away She jabs in a phone number

LAUREN 0S
It’s too late The battery is
dead

Gunner and Wheeler jog up escalator Both hoodless as well

Wheeler’s attention turns to the MSG sign

WHEELER RADIO
Holy shit

Wheeler points to the sign making sure everyone else knows

what he’s going on about

WHEELER RADIO
Do you think the rumors or true

GUNNER RADIO
That it’s a mass graveyard I
doubt it

WHEELER RADIO
Let’s check it out --

NAVI RADIO
-- No way Being around these dead
people are enough Twenty
thousand NO

GUNNER RADIO
Yeah She’s right And we need to
load this stuff on the bus before
they find us here

WHEELER RADIO
That shit ain’t going anywhere
It’ll take a second

Wheeler stands before you He reaches up CLICK turning on

the hood’s LED light

WHEELER RADIO
Lead the way doc

Lauren GULPS as Wheeler opens one of the doors You LOOK
into a corridor engulfed by darkness Lauren steps into

MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - FLOOR LEVEL CORRIDOR

Lauren LEADS the extraction team down an hundred yard
concrete hallway She readies the shotgun anticipating the
worst The corridor finally leads to

SECTION 66

Pitch black inside the coliseum Laurens helmet emits a
beam of light stretching across the floor Basketball court
left abandoned set up for a New York Knicks game

UP - Into the stands At full capacity like a sellout crowd
every seat you see in the light is occupied by a DEAD BODY

THU-THU-THUMP Running footsteps over the hardwood They
gradually amplify getting closer

FORWARD - A group SHADOWY FIGURES run across the basketball
court It’s hard to make out who it is but with the tension
in the air no one’s taking the chance to find out
GUNNER RADIO
I knew we shouldn’t have came in
here
BOOM Gunpowder flashes as Gunner fires into the darkness

You RUN back to the entry doors through the

FLOOR LEVEL CORRIDOR

First out is Wheeler Then Navi and Gunner Laurens last
into

PENN STATION - UPPER LEVEL

SPINNING to look into the corridor The Shadows become more
visible -- EIGHT INFECTEDS

Wheeler SLAMS the double doors shut Gunner pushes a hard
shoulder against them He points into the station

GUNNER RADIO
Get something to keep this shut

Navi scurries around in a panic

Lauren looks LEFT and then RIGHT Focus stops as you see a
coiled fire hose behind a broken glass cabinet

Lauren shoves the shotgun under her arm and SPRINTS to the
hose She yanks the door open Glass falls onto her right
hand slicing a long wound in the skin

No time for first aid she grabs the nozzle and RUNS back to
the double doors You WATCH Laurens hands figure-eight the
hose between the handles Once tight she takes a step back

Gunner and Wheeler release their hold The Infecteds SLAM
into the doors The metal dents outward but doesnt open

GUNNER RADIO
Good work

WHEELER RADIO
We need to get our asses back to
the island Now

NAVI RADIO
You’re the dumbass wanting to
explore

LAUREN 0S
I suggest you all put your helmets
back on

DOWN - Lauren searches for her glove No luck as it has been
lost during the panic

LAUREN RADIO
And has anyone seen my glove

FORWARD - The team has disappeared back to the escalator
With no helmets they didn’t hear Lauren

She runs to catch up as everyone stops Frozen Not moving
an inch

You GLANCE to the first level elevator About FIFTY
INFECTEDS fight over the food and water rations

WHEELER 0S RADIO
Fuck

One Infected wears Wheeler’s biosafety helmet

NAVI OS RADIO
Now what do we do

BACK to the double doors The fire hose is becoming
untangled and won’t hold long

LAUREN (0S
We need a plan quick

WHEELER RADIO
Go down there and blast their asses
to hell

Lauren checks the chamber Two shells

LAUREN OS
I’ve only go two shots

You TURN to Gunner His eyes size up the fight Fingers run
along the dogs tags around the shotgun

GUNNER RADIO
You guys find a way to the bus
Ill hold them off and meet you

there
LAUREN 0S NAVI RADIO
No way That’s suicide You can’t take them all

Gunner stands his ground Slowly turns his head to the team

GUNNER RADIO
Go

Gunner marches down the escalator He begins to hum “Susie
Q” again His song fades away as he distances himself out of
your radio range

GUNNER OS RADIO
Oh say that you’ll be true and
never leave me blue Susie Q

With Infecteds blocking the first level and MSG routes
Wheeler dashes to a set of windows facing Seventh Avenue
Navi follows Lauren hesitates before she CHASES behind

Wheeler looks out of the window

WHEELER RADIO
The bus is just over there

Lauren PEERS over his shoulder You only see the top of the
bus Everything else is blocked by the roofed structure at
the building entrance

BOOM BOOM Gunner goes to town downstairs BOOM BOOM

Wheeler grabs a steel trash can He heaves it at the window
CRASHING through the glass

LAUREN RADIO
What do you plan on doing
Jumping That’s at least a ten
foot drop

Wheeler points out of the broken window

WHEELER RADIO
We can make it on top of that
Then over to the bus

BOOM BOOM BOOM More shotgun blasts

WHEELER RADIO
It’s either jumping Or dying

Wheeler steps through the window He prepares to push off
BOOM BOOM --

Silence

NAVI RADIO
You think he got them all

LAUREN RADIO
I only heard about ten shots

NAVI RADIO
Maybe they scattered back into the
subways

BACK - The remaining Infecteds from downstairs dash up the
escalator All set their sights on you three

WHEELER RADIO
Fuck no they didn’t

The fire hose unwinds around the double doors The MSG
Infecteds SPRAWL out joining the rest

AT THE WINDOW - Wheeler dives outside
Navi follows SCREAMING on her way down

Lauren SLIDES into the window with Gunner’s old shotgun in
her lap Wheeler waves his hands at you

WHEELER RADIO
Throw me the gun

LAUREN OS
I don’t trust you enough right now

WHEELER RADIO
Fine Fuck your trust You can
die with it

Wheeler jogs across and jumps on top of the bus Navi gives
you a concerned look before she jumps behind Wheeler

A quick GLANCE over your shoulder Infecteds all ready to
kill run towards Lauren And then --

FREE FALLING in a pushed jump Lauren lands hard on the
concrete roof top The shotgun slips from her hands She
quickly grabs it and rushes to the edge

Wheeler slides down the front of the bus to the hood And
then a jump to street level

Navi waves for you

NAVI RADIO
Come on Just one more jump

Lauren builds up the courage and then FLIES onto the bus
Her boots slip on the roof almost falling off the side
Navi grabs Lauren’s arm helping you up Before Lauren can
give thanks Navi slides down the hood

You notice something from the NORTH three blocks away on
Seventh Avenue It’s an NYFD FIRE TRUCK speeding directly
in the open path towards the prison bus

LAUREN 0S
Hey Hey The fire department is
coming

Lauren waves her arms and YELLS to attract attention

LAUREN RADIO
Hey Over here

WHEELER 0S RADIO NAVI OS RADIO
What There’s no fire Most of the firemen are on
department left the Island

The fire truck is now two blocks away and gaining fast

LAUREN 0S
Then who is that

Wheeler checks up the street

WHEELER 0S RADIO
Get the fuck away from here

Wheeler and Navi dash away

As the fire truck hits one block away you SEE that it’s
operated by INFECTEDS

Lauren stands frozen not sure what to do Wheeler and Navi
are gone from sight

A split second to decide --

Lauren DARTS to the end of the bus As she jumps down to the
street --

CRASH The fire truck PLOWS through the prison bus
SLAMMING it into a set of parked taxis

You ROLL on the ground and finally stop Shotgun glued to
Lauren’s hands and not going anywhere

You LOOK through

32ND STREET

Wheeler and Navi are in a dead sprint away from you Lauren
CLIMBS UP and RACES through the street It’s narrowed
packed with tightly parked metro buses

QUICK GLANCE over the shoulder A pair of INFECTEDS hop off
the fire truck but they don’t chase after you They want to
make this hunt fun

FOCUSED AHEAD signs slowly shift from English to Korean text
as Lauren hits

32ND STREET 6TH AVENUE
A brief stop in the intersection trying to FIND the others

As Lauren catches her breath you SPOT Navi a block away
She yells at you Out of range it’s muffled in the helmet

NAVI MUFFLED
Hey Over here

Navi waits behind a USPS mailbox as Lauren sprints TOWARDS

31ST STREET 6TH AVENUE

Lauren BENDS DOWN Hands rest on the knees breathing hard
slightly BOBBING Words tangled with gasps for air

LAUREN 0S

Where did he go
NAVI OS RADIO
I don’t know
(beat)

He outran me I don’t know if he
kept going or is hiding somewhere
around here

PAT PAT Navi gently smacks Lauren’s back

NAVI OS RADIO
Come on Stand up You’1l catch
your breath better

RISING UP as Lauren stands tall
LEFT - Small businesses at the base of tall buildings Each

with their metal door pulled down A DEAD WOMAN sits on a
bus stop bench She’s hunched over covered in blood

RIGHT - A green construction wall surrounds an industrial
lot Heavy machinery sits idle unmanned and slowly
rusting

LAUREN (0S
Where can we go now

NAVI RADIO
Call for help

LAUREN 0S
I’m not walking around looking for
another cellphone

Navi reaches towards your helmet CLICK

NAVI RADIO
No Call the control center

Lauren hesitates a second before she gets it

LAUREN 0S
Hello Control This is the
doctor on extraction team three
fourteen Is anyone there

Waiting Waiting No response
Lauren reaches up to twist back to proximal Navi stops her

Voice muffled as this frequency doesn’t include the external
microphone

NAVI MUFFLED
Keep it on just in case

A vehicle ROARS from 32nd Street Navi PULLS you behind a
double decker tour bus LOOKING UP to see a few DEAD BODIES
dangling over the edge

AROUND THE BUS you see that fire truck creep through the
intersection The same Infecteds hang on to the side rails
keeping a vigilant watch on the streets

LAUREN 0S

Why are they doing this They
should be seeking help before they
die

NAVI OS MUFFLED
They’ve given up help It’s
brutal Clans are set up to
protect the territories Were
trespassers to them

The fire truck disappears around a set of buildings

LAUREN 0S
Have they resorted to cannibalism

NAVI OS MUFFLED
I don’t stick around long enough to
find out but by now I wouldn’t
doubt it

You SEARCH the area for a getaway and see an array of
abandoned vehicles

LAUREN OS

The one’s in orange The
drivers Um Wheelers How does
that rule work

NAVI MUFFLED
Rules That’s only on the Island
There are no rules out here

Lauren points to the closest vehicle -- simple four door
sedan A black spray-painted X tagged on the hood

LAUREN OS
We could take one of these back

Lauren SQUEEZES into the car’s open window You see a pair
of keys stuck in the ignition

LAUREN 0S
This one has keys

NAVI OS MUFFLED
It’s no use

You GLANCE back to Navi

NAVI RADIO

All these X’s the gas has been
sucked out That’s how they mark
them

SCANNING the street Nearly all vehicles have an X

NAVI MUFFLED
We can use this

LAUREN OS
The bus

NAVI RADIO
The map

Navi spots a map printed on the back of the tour bus A
giant star marks the office location with other local
streets labeled in the area

Lauren steps up to Navi’s side You READ the map as Navi’s
finger points out a route

NAVI OS MUFFLED
We’re here

Her finger scrolls four blocks slightly past Park Avenue

NAVI OS MUFFLED
And this is where I used to work
We can hide out there until the
next team comes

LAUREN 0S
When’s that going to be

NAVI MUFFLED
Maybe tomorrow Maybe next week

LAUREN 0S

Wait I was told these last an
hour If we aren’t back soon
won’t they send for us

Navi gets a laugh out of that

NAVI MUFFLED
If we’re not back soon they think
were dead They’re not going to
gamble losing another vehicle or
another doctor

LAUREN OS
What’s that supposed to mean

NAVI MUFFLED
It means that you’re God on the
Island If we both were crawling
to the gate they’d shoot me first
and then escort you in

(beat)
It’s a half mile away Are up for
the run

LAUREN 0S
Five six minutes We won’t make
it

Lauren SPOTS something on the sidewalk A CYCLIST’s body
tangled in a wrecked bicycle Deep cracks in both his
protective helmet and skull Blood oozes out of the wound

LAUREN 0S
The bike

Lauren and Navi RUSH to the Cyclist Both overshadow his
body While reaching for the cycle tires the Cyclist
twitches -- he’s not dead

CYCLIST MUFFLED
Hell

LAUREN 0S
He’s still alive

NAVI MUFFLED
He won’t be for long His brains
are hanging out of his head We
need to move

Lauren and Navi jerk the bike from the Cyclist’s body He
rolls over revealing a massive skull fracture

Navi steadies a foot on the pedal and climbs over the
crossbar

NAVI MUFFLED
Get on the seat and I’1l pedal

Lauren mounts herself on the seat With the shotgun held in
her lap she wraps the other arm around Navi’s waist Your
view is completely blocked by Navi’s suit

As Navi gyrates the bicycle’s chain GRINDS on its crank
With bent rims the ride slightly WOBBLES

LEFT - A semi-trailer lies jackknifed and overturned as you
ride by the intersection of

31ST STREET BROADWAY AVENUE

The stretch towards fifth is a long and haunting one Navi
starts to get the hang of riding double and increases her
pedaling speed

RIGHT - A construction shelter covers the sidewalk Patchy
plywood wall borders the scaffolding “THE EMPIRE” is tagged
under a long row of tally marks similar to a prisoner
counting his days in jail

LEFT - The fallen Harold Square hotel sign is embedded in the
roof of a brown UPS truck FOCUS stays on the hotel’s second
floor windows Golden steel words read “LIFE”

View remains to the left as you cross

31ST STREET 5TH AVENUE

FOUR INFECTEDS attempt to jump start a stray car One
carries a woodsman’s axe Another smacks a metal pipe in his
hand

LAUREN OS
There’s more Pedal faster

NAVI OS MUFFLED
I’m trying

The Infecteds take a a few approaching steps before going
into a full sprint after the bike

LAUREN 0S
They’re coming

Navi pedals more furiously With the Hotel Chandler on the
RIGHT and an equally grand apartment building on the LEFT
there is nowhere to go but straight

Lauren attempts to GLANCE over her shoulder but it shifts
the balance on the bike Navi loses control and stops dead
on with a curb You’re THROWN OFF to the sidewalk

BACK - The Infecteds are still in pursuit a half block away

Lauren SPRINGS UP to her feet You look DOWN at the bike and
see the front rim is completely bent into the fork

LAUREN OS
How far are we

Navi crawls to her feet The crash has heavily scraped the
front her suit

NAVI MUFFLED
Madison Park two blocks

QUICK LOOK FORWARD - An abandoned electrician’s van is parked
under a tree just beyond the intersection The side doors
open A pair of JEANED LEGS dangle out

Lauren points it out to Navi

LAUREN OS
There

You and Navi SPRINT through the intersection of

31ST STREET MADISON AVENUE

Something grabs your attention to the LEFT The fire truck
remains on patrol only a few blocks away

FORWARD - Attention turned back on the van as you quickly
approach The legs belong to a DEAD ELECTRICIAN His clothing
is covered in blood from screwdriver wounds not the virus

Navi jumps into the van Lauren quickly looks RIGHT - The
Infecteds are still on the hunt She DIVES into the

ELECTRICIAN’S VAN

Lauren helps Navi push the Electrician’s body out of the van
Both grab a side door slamming them shut

Navi lunges between the front seats to lock the doors She
crawls back next to you searching through tools for a
weapon She rises back up wielding a power drill A press
of the trigger -- VROO VROO It has power

You hear footsteps STOMP the pavement and surround the van

PASSENGER SIDE - THUMP One of the Infecteds give the doors
a shoulder block

DRIVERS SIDE - THUMP Another Infected does the same

REAR DOORS - Windowless you can’t see anything until -- BAM
The axe blade slices through the metal A quick jiggle pulls
it out And then another swing into the van BAM

NAVI MUFFLED
Shoot them

LAUREN OS
There’s only two shots left and
four --

SMASH Glass SHATTERS Navi and Lauren SCREAM

FRONT - The Infected with the metal pipe smashes through the
passenger window

BAM Another swing of the axe

THUMP THUMP Both SLAM into the sides

The Infected cracks all the glass away Rather unlocking the
door he dives in through the opening He stretches a hand
to grab Lauren

You CRAWL BACK a few inches out of his reach

VRO-VRERRRRRRR Navi jabs the drill into the Infected’s arm
The bit bores through his flesh and bone He ROARS an
ungodly scream and pulls back out of the window

BAM
REAR - The axe starts to form a larger hole in the door

LAUREN OS
What do we do

NAVI MUFFLED
I don’t know

Lauren looks DOWN Hands desperately search through tools
junk trash and wires across the floor You see a plastic
lunch box

BAM The axe cracks through the locking system on the rear
door It jiggles open an inch

Lauren dumps the lunch box contents out -- a heavily molded
bologna sandwich a closed coffee thermos and two cans of
Vienna sausages

You WATCH Lauren’s gloveless hand POP open the can’s lid

REAR - The door swings open All four Infecteds are ready to
attack but stop frozen Eyes glued to Lauren as she raises
the Vienna sausages

The passenger door swings open Navi dashes out

NAVI OS MUFFLED
Come on

Lauren throws the cans out the rear door She TURNS to the
front and squeezes through the door Now back on

31ST STREET

Lauren DARTS after Navi running past the van You see the
Infecteds battle over the Vienna sausages

Back on the path AHEAD She breaks into a dead sprint Both
ZIGZAG between sidewalks using parked semi trucks for cover
You finally make it to

31ST STREET PARK AVENUE

After crossing the four-lane intersection not taking a
second to look anywhere else you and Navi STOP

NAVI MUFFLED
It’s just ahead a half block away

A crashed metro bus blocks the RIGHT sidewalk Fallen
scaffoldings obstructs the LEFT The only option is FORWARD -
Construction dumpsters block you and Navi from the florist

Navi climbs atop the dumpster She dashes to the edge and
jumps to the next

Lauren SCALES the dumpster Its contents covered with a
thick rubber tarp Soft and squishy underneath you SINK
with each running step And then a JUMP to the next

The second’s load is jagged and harder to navigate Lauren
loses her footing and you TRIP It pushes the tarp to the
side -- The load is comprised of DEAD BODIES

Behind you -- RURRRRRR SCREEECH

While on her knees Lauren TURNS BACK to look at the
electricians van The fire truck cuts onto thirty-first
street in a direct path to the van stopping next to it

The fire truck Infecteds hop off each brandishing a clubbed
weapon -- Baseball bat crowbar and police baton A war
ensues between the two groups

With the view slightly impaired by leafless tree limbs all
you see is an Infected hit the ground And then another
The battle disappears behind the vehicles

PA-RAP-PAP-PAP A series of rifle shots echo through the
streets Something is happening back there you can’t see it

NAVI OS MUFFLED
Hey Come on

SPINNING FORWARD to see half of Navi’s body sticking out of a
florist shop’s doorway She waves you over

Lauren HOPS down from the dumpster and runs into the

MANHATTAN FLORIST

Bamboo blinds dangle over broken storefront windows Dead
flowers and shattered ceramic gifts litter the floor A
series of flattened mylar balloons hang from a metal rod
Surprisingly enough they all say “GET WELL”

Navi leads Lauren behind the counter Both CROUCH low using
it for cover Breathing slowly fades back to normal

LAUREN OS
Did you hear the gunshots back
there

NAVI MUFFLED
It’s probably rival clans Better
they kill each other than us

FORWARD - Three desks lie toppled on the floor Paperwork
everywhere Newspapers yellow and pink receipts wrapping
paper and catalogs

Navi crawls into the paper trash in front of the middle desk
She plows it to the side searching for something and
eventually finds it -- a framed photo

She slides back to the Lauren’s side You LOOK at the frame
A wrinkled photo of NAVI’S SON 7 is behind the glass The
boy smiles with Yankees shortstop Derek Jeter

LAUREN OS
That’s your son

Navi breaks down instantly but attempts to fight the tears

NAVI MUFFLED
Yeah

LAUREN (0S
What’s his name

NAVI MUFFLED
Josh He’s eight now

Navi cracks open the back of the frame removing the photo
Denial that Josh is dead weaves within her optimistic tone

NAVI MUFFLED
He loves baseball His dream is be
a Yankee one day

LAUREN (0S
I’m sure when this is all over
he’ll reach that dream --

CRUNCH SOMEONE lurks into the florist stepping on the
broken ceramics Navi motions an inaudible “Shhhh”

The footsteps get closer Louder

The shotgun barrel rises in the center of your view pointing
straight to the ceiling

CRACK That Someone is merely on the other side of the
counter It becomes deathly quiet for a moment --

A DOCTOR’s voice fades into Lauren’s radio

DOCTOR VO RADIO
Hello Is anyone out there

Lauren scrambles to switch the radio

THA-THUMP That Someone lunges atop the counter looking
down on Lauren and Navi

UP - It’s Wheeler He realizes he’s looking down the shotgun
barrel Quickly slides back over the counter

NAVI RADIO
Fuck Scared the shit of us

LAUREN 0S
Where the hell did you go

Wheeler walks around and sits next to Navi

WHEELER RADIO
I hid in some bank

Wheeler shakes the front his suit Obviously a little fatter
than before
WHEELER RADIO
Decided to start a retirement plan
I thought I saw you two come in
here

LAUREN OS
Did you see what happened up there

WHEELER RADIO
There’s the fire truck and two
cabs out on the street The guys
in the cabs are packin’

Navi pokes Lauren
NAVI RADIO
Someone was trying to call you on

Lauren switches the frequency on her helmet
voice comes in again

DOCTOR VO RADIO
Hello Hello

LAUREN 0S
Hello Who is this

The Doctor’s

Navi and Wheeler watch Lauren’s lips as if they can’t hear

the whole conversation

DOCTOR VO RADIO
Who are you

LAUREN OS

My name is Doctor Lauren Chase
I’m with an extraction team in
Manhattan

DOCTOR VO RADIO
Doctor Ward at Langone
(beat)
This is great news I have ten
uninfected people with me that you
can take back

LAUREN 0S
We don’t have a vehicle

WHEELER MUFFLED NAVI
What are they saying Who is it

MUFFLED

DR WARD V0O RADIO
There are a few squads in our
parking garage but the keys are
missing Might be able to figure
something out Where are you now

Lauren turns to Navi She’s lost in the photo of Josh

LAUREN OS
Hey What streets are we on

NAVI MUFFLED
Were next to Thirty-First and
Lexington

Lauren relays the information to Dr Ward

LAUREN 0S
Thirty-First and Lexington

DR WARD V0O RADIO
Perfect Get to First We’re in
the Arnold and Marie Schwartz
building

Dr Ward’s voice fades out as he switches off his own radio
Wheeler and Navi both anticipate the news

LAUREN OS
You said you were extracted from
Bellevue How far is Langone from
that

NAVI MUFFLED
They’re nearly side-by-side It’s
three maybe four blocks from here

LAUREN 0S
We may have a way out of here

Lauren LOOKS to Wheeler

LAUREN OS
He said you were a car thief --

WHEELER MUFFLED

-- Yeah That’s right There’s no
chance of stealing any of those out
there --

LAUREN 0S
-- Think you can hotwire an
ambulance

Wheeler chuckles

WHEELER MUFFLED
If it means getting back to the
Island I’1l hotwire a fucking
lawnmower

LAUREN 0S
Then let’s do this

Navi folds up Josh’s picture and slowly peeks over the
counter

NAVI MUFFLED
It’s clear

Navi leads the way to the doorway Wheeler next And then
Lauren RISES up to follow

Wheeler tiptoes out onto the sidewalk He looks around a
parked car back towards the fire truck Quickly returns to
the doorway with an update

WHEELER MUFFLED
The fire truck’s still there I
couldn’t see if those two cabs were
still out
NAVI MUFFLED
One of the blocks is a park We
can hide in there if we need to
Wheeler and Lauren NOD A few deep breaths and then --

All three SPRINT outside of the florist back onto

31ST STREET
LEFT - Navi running ahead of you sticking to the sidewalk
RIGHT - On the opposite sidewalk Wheeler maintains a

straight path He hurdles over trash and slides atop
blocking vehicles He begins to pull away as you cross

31ST STREET LEXINGTON AVENUE

Fueled by adrenaline and possibly some fear Lauren finds
another gear You speed by Navi and take the lead

AHEAD - A fallen neon PARKING sign blocks the sidewalk
You HURDLE over it and continue on not looking back

Shade flashes from trees as Lauren RACES through to

31ST STREET 3RD AVENUE

It begins to get greener with trees standing taller than
their neighboring buildings Lauren’s breathing becomes so
labored it sounds like an asthma attack

FORWARD - Another structure blocks the sidewalk but this
wont be easily jumped over A twisted fire escape lies
fallen atop a parked SUV Lauren runs into the road around
the obstacle

A rogue TAXI CAB turns at the next intersection It’s manned
by THREE INFECTEDS -- One DRIVER and two GUNMEN in the rear
Barrels of rifles stick out of the windows

LEFT - Still blocked by the steel fire escape

AHEAD - The taxi Driver spots you He speeds dead on into
your direction

LEFT - Finally an opening as Lauren runs behind a parked
minivan --

POP-POP-POP The passenger side Gunman shoots at Lauren as
the cab speeds by Bullets PLINK off the minivan’s hood

GLANCING BACK - Through the trees the cab continues to the
next intersection

Lauren jogs into the street maintaining focus on the cab
It does a hard U-turn on Third Avenue sliding the tail
completely around

Navi jets by you

NAVI MUFFLED
Don’t stop now

SPINNING AROUND back on the path following Navi Lauren
picks up the pace passing her once again

Both finally hit

31ST STREET 2ND AVENUE

The street ends blocked by a massive two-story theater
RIGHT - A lonely Second Avenue stretches to the south
LEFT - Second Avenue stretching to the north

FORWARD - Another look at the theater There is no park that
Navi mentioned

She stops by your side for a quick second --

WEE-WHEET Wheeler WHISTLES for your attention It comes
from the north side of the theater building hidden behind a
set of trees Navi points to it

NAVI MUFFLED
The park’s over there

Navi and Lauren SPRINT north on

SECOND AVENUE

After passing the theater you see a small fenced in area
Wheeler waits hidden behind a tree trunk

A QUICK GLANCE BACK sees another CAB join in the chase Only
a DRIVER in this one They wildly pinball through the
abandoned traffic

Wheeler springs over a waist high fence like its second
nature Lauren JUMPS attempting the same but a pointed iron
bar catches on to the suit --

RIIIPPP Lauren THUDS hard on the ground She LOOKS to her
suit’s legs The right is fine The left is ripped from the
knee down exposing her flesh

Navi rolls over the fence top and lands next to Lauren
Almost instantly shes back on her feet

NAVI MUFFLED
Damn it

Navi sticks her feet in the fence preparing to climb again

THROUGH THE FENCE you see the photo of Josh flying across
the road in the wind

Lauren stretches to grab Navi’s leg
LAUREN 0S
Don’t go Forget about it It’s
lost

Navi kicks Lauren away

NAVI MUFFLED
I can’t forget about him

Navi crawls over the fence She races to grab the picture

LEFT - The two cabs speed in Navis direction Both racing
to take the lead

FORWARD - Navi steps on the photo to keep it from flying
away She bends down picking it up

LAUREN OS
Watch out

Navi doesnt acknowledge Lauren All focus remains on the
photo A smile grows on her face as if she’s finally
accepting Josh is dead and she’1ll be with him again --
THA-DUNK The leading taxi drives into Navi Her body flips
onto the hood and crashes into the windshield It SCREECHES
to a halt

The two Gunmen step out They grab Navi’s dead body Both
haul her into the cab and it speeds off

As Lauren sits on the ground lamenting over Navi the second
cab’s Driver spots you He gets out and slowly proceeds to
the park gate

Lauren BUSTLES back UP She runs through the trees into a

COURTYARD

The twenty-floor Kips Bay Towers borders the left A six
piece playground swing sits idle under an oak tree Some of
its swings are missing

One on one with two shots left Lauren PUMPS the shotgun
You SPIN around raising to take aim --

The Infected TACKLES Lauren to the ground The shotgun slips
from her hands

The Infected rabbit punches the helmet --

STATIC BLACK OUT

The radio continues on as the fists THUD against Lauren’s
skull Her screams are chilling as she struggles

LAUREN OS
Get off of me

COURTYARD

Transmission returns to see the Infected flailing fists at
Lauren’s face shield --

A chain spins around the Infected’s neck A quick jerk yanks
his body off of Lauren

SLIDING BACK - You see Wheeler tightening a swing chain
multiple times Pulling tighter The Infected CHOKES for
air but too late He’s strangled to death

Wheeler releases the Infected’s body Lauren WATCHES him
walk around her He picks up the shotgun

WHEELER MUFFLED
Still don’t trust me

Wheeler tosses the shotgun into Lauren’s lap She RISES UP
back to her feet

Wheeler looks around for Navi

WHEELER MUFFLED J
Where’d she go

LAUREN 0S
She’s dead They took her away

WHEELER MUFFLED J
Fuck Now where do we go

LAUREN 0S
She said it was just past the park

Lauren points east Without realizing there’s a cab with a
running engine on Second both PROCEED to First

Wheeler and Lauren stop behind a six foot metal gate and look
out across First Avenue

UP - The colossal NYU medical building TRACKING DOWN to the
first floor Lauren turns SLIGHTLY RIGHT spotting the
neighboring ARNOLD AND MARIE SCHWARTZ BUILDING

LAUREN OS
We have to get over there

Side by side Wheeler and Lauren SCALE the gate Wheeler
hops down as Lauren slightly STUMBLES

Both DASH across

FIRST AVENUE

A quick HURDLE over a knee high stone wall and CREEPING LOW
to the front entrance The automatic doors are locked shut
and won’t open

Lauren SCANS inside but you mostly see her own reflection

WHEELER 0S RADIO
Is anyone in there

INSIDE Dr Ward jogs towards the door A blue biosafety
suit is worn over his chubby torso Bushy beard in his
helmet Ten PATIENTS all wearing scrubs flock behind him

Dr Ward’s mouth speaks but words inaudible

LAUREN 0S
I can’t hear you

Dr Ward switches his frequency knob

DR WARD RADIO
Are you Doctor Chase

LAUREN OS
Yes

Dr Ward gives a suspicious look to Wheeler

DR WARD RADIO
Who’s this guy

LAUREN 0S
He’s the team’s Wheeler Are you
going to let us in

DR WARD RADIO
These doors won’t open without
power

LAUREN OS
How do we get in

DR WARD RADIO
You have to prove you’re not
infected Your suit’s torn to shit
and he’s missing the helmet How
do I know this isn’t some ploy

WHEELER MUFFLED
Fuck you man

Wheeler SLAMS a hand on the door

WHEELER MUFFLED
Let us in

Lauren pulls her Mosquito from the suit’s right pocket She
presses a button extending the needle Quickly swabs her
wound The blood swirls with the chemical It stays red

She extends another needle poking it in Wheeler’s exposed
neck He glares at Dr Ward as the blood remains red

DR WARD RADIO
You’1l1 have to meet us in the
garage

Dr Ward points to his left your right

Wheeler dashes away Lauren pockets the Mosquito and FOLLOWS
to the

NYU MEDICAL FACILITY - GARAGE

Lower level basement garage Strategically parked vehicles
have their headlights on providing light inside

LEFT - A hospital emergency exit opens Dr Ward rushes out
with his ten Patients He points to a few parked NYU
Medical Center ambulances

DR WARD RADIO
We can take one of those

Lauren and Dr Ward both return their headset frequencies to
proximal

Everyone heads to Squad Unit 1952 Wheeler opens the
drivers door

WHEELER RADIO
This one got gas in it

DR WARD RADIO
They all should The average
civilian doesn’t even know where
the gas tank is on one of these

A door SLAMS shut somewhere within the garage

LAUREN RADIO
You hear that

PANNING through the darkness and then quickly blinded by a
pair of headlights

DR WARD RADIO
I didn’t hear anything

Wheeler disappears under the dashboard

Dr Ward opens the rear doors He shouts orders to his
Patients

DR WARD RADIO
Dump everything out to make room
for everyone

The Patients convene in the ambulance cabin They throw out
a stretcher Then boxes of basic medical supplies

Lauren steps up to Dr Ward

LAUREN OS
Are these all of the survivors you
have left

DR WARD RADIO
Sadly yes Everyone’s dead in
Langone At least two thousand --

Another door SLAMS Dr Ward heard this one He retreats to
the rear of the ambulance climbing inside

DR WARD RADIO
Everyone get in

The engine RUMBLES to a start Wheeler returns to a seated
position

ANOTHER QUICK SCAN of the garage SHADOWS appear behind
vehicles Lauren HURRIES to the passenger side door She
swings it open and CLIMBS into

RESCUE UNIT 1952
Wheeler jerks the gear into drive

BACK - The Patients are sardined in the cabin As Dr Ward
pulls the doors shut --

A HORDE of INFECTEDS surround the ambulance Those with
weapons start beating on it It ROCKS from side to side

An Infected grabs a Patient dragging them into the garage
All others try to move closer towards the front

DR WARD RADIO
Drive

PA-PA-PAHHH The engine stalls
Three Infecteds reach in and clutch a Patient each Dr Ward
kicks their arms but it’s not enough He loses three more

into the darkness

You notice Dr Ward protecting one specific FEMALE PATIENT

DRIVERS SIDE - Wheeler sparks wires under the steering
wheel

LAUREN 0S
Get it started

FRONT - An Infected spins a construction pickaxe in his hand
He swings at the grill --

LAUREN OS
Now

WHEELER 0S RADIO
I’m trying bitch

BAM The pointed end is embedded in the radiator Blue
cooling fluid spews out He jerks the pickaxe out

The engine kicks on Wheeler STOMPS the gas Two Patients
fall out from the force alone now down to five

THA-DUMP Wheeler drives over the pickaxe Infected

WATCHING AHEAD as Wheeler wildly speeds through the garage
Other INFECTEDS lunge out but are flung against the ambulance
body

You see daylight from the exit

WHEELER RADIO
Where do I go Left or right

LAUREN (0S
Right Same way we came in
Through the tunnel

Wheeler BOUNCES up over the exit ramp getting a little
airborne and landing on

1ST AVENUE
A quick spin of the steering wheel

Wheeler wastes no time increasing speed flashing through

1ST AVENUE 33RD STREET

WHEELER RADIO
How far is it

LAUREN RADIO
I don’t know

DR WARD 0S RADIO
A few blocks up

Lauren checks her SIDE MIRROR You’re not alone on the
streets The first cab trails behind and gaining quick

LAUREN RADIO
Speed up They’re following us

Wheeler puts full force on the pedal but it’s not enough
The cab pulls up on the passenger side nose to nose --

BAM The cab slams into your door Both driving over eighty
while continuing through

1ST AVENUE 34TH STREET
Dr Ward squeezes between the front seats
DR WARD RADIO

You missed the tunnel road Take

the next left or we’ll never hit

it
BAM The cab hits the squad again Lauren rolls down her
window She extends the shotgun out with a finger on the
trigger

A SHARP LEFT ambulance nearly flipping over driving onto

35TH STREET

The cab remains lodged on the side --

BOOM Lauren fires one of the shells at the cab BURSTS the
front tire and peppers the quarter panel The Cab Driver
loses control sliding on the sidewalk

You WATCH the cab CRASH into trees of the St Vartan’s Park

DR WARD 0S RADIO
This turn Right

Wheeler makes a quick turn right onto the

TUNNEL ENTRANCE STREET

AHEAD - Abandoned vehicles block the path to the tunnel
Going too fast to stop Wheeler jerks right riding on the
sidewalk An iron fence GRINDS the squad’s cabin

BA-DUMP Hitting the street again Easing right onto the

QUEENS MIDTOWN EXPRESSWAY

Back on a familiar road as the ambulance speeds into the
darkness of the

QUEENS MIDTOWN TUNNEL - EASTBOUND LANE

Wheeler flips the light switch Headlights beam on and
auburn emergency lights flash The WIIISHHHH is a little
louder this time with deeper water in the tunnel

WHEELER RADIO

Fuck those back roads Straight on
the expressway until we hit the
Island

Wheeler looks over to you
WHEELER RADIO
I’m surprised you finally shot that

thing How many are left

LAUREN 0S
One but I’m saving that

You LOOK BACK to check on the Patients Dr Ward consoles
the Female Patient

Everything’s SHAKEN UP as Wheeler jerks the wheel right
WHEELER RADIO
Don’t want that thing ripping
through the roof again

FORWARD - Daylight slowly fills the tunnel

Fading in brighter and brighter exiting to the

QUEENS MIDTOWN EXPRESSWAY

Lauren LEANS OVER checking out the dashboard gauges The
ambulance breaks a hundred on the speedometer

WHEELER RADIO
You gonna check them too

Dr Ward heard that He instantly replies

DR WARD 0S RADIO
I’ve already checked my patients

You GLANCE to Dr Ward

LAUREN 0S
But I haven’t And this is my
extraction run

DR WARD RADIO
And this is my ambulance My word
should be good for it

The Female Patient grows nervous while the others know it’s
just routine protocol

LAUREN 0S
If I bring infected people to the
gate they won’t let any of us in

DR WARD RADIO
Bullshit They let everyone in
accompanied by an extraction team

LAUREN 0S
I have to do this

Lauren removes her Mosquito She springs out a needle

LAUREN OS
Who’s first

One Patient willingly extends their arm Lauren tests the
blood It remains red She tests the next three Patients
all are clean Finally the Female Patient

Dr Ward gives a concerned look to the Female Patient as
Lauren jabs the needle into her skin

FOCUSED on the needle The blood connects with the chemical
It slowly transforms to black Lauren RETREATS to the
passenger seat

LAUREN 0S
She’s infected

Those two words uproot instant chaos between the other
Patients

WHEELER 0S RADIO LAUREN OS
Get her the fuck out You need to stop

WHEELER 0S RADIO
Fuck no I’m not stopping Throw
the bitch out or no one is getting
on the Island

DR WARD RADIO
No No She’s my wife Please

BACK - The other Patients surround the Female Patient

WHEELER 0S RADIO
Now god dammit

Dr Ward attempts to fight them off They overpower him and
push the Female Patient toward the rear doors She pleas for
help but those are ignored --

A hefty shove forces her out of the ambulance You WATCH her
body bounce and grind across the asphalt

DR WARD RADIO
No

Dr Ward punches at the Patients He starts CRYING heavily
Another glimpse at his dead wife as Wheeler cuts onto the

BROOKLYN QUEENS EXPRESSWAY
Dr Ward drops to his knees

DR WARD RADIO
Why Why

LAUREN OS
You need to get off on exit forty-
one

A Patient interrupts Lauren’s navigation
PATIENT RADIO
But that takes us to Jackson
Heights away from the Island

LAUREN 0S
We have someone else to pick up

This infuriates Dr Ward

DR WARD RADIO
What Youre going to pick
someone else up after throwing my
wife out

LAUREN 0S
Look She was infected We both
know they weren’t going to let her
in

DR WARD RADIO
She got sick yesterday It’s still
treatable

WHEELER RADIO
I’m not running shuttle stops
through here If you want to pick
up someone else you can come back
later

Lauren aims the shotgun’s barrel an inch from Wheeler’s face

LAUREN OS
You are making this stop

WHEELER RADIO
Really I don’t think you’re
heartless enough to even think
about it

LAUREN 0S
I told you I was saving this shot

Lauren PUMPS the shotgun
Silence fills the cabin

LAUREN 0S
Maybe we can work out a deal when
we get back You can have my
quarters and fifty percent of my
rations

Wheeler thinks it over A good offer for these rough times

WHEELER RADIO
Deal Just get that fucking thing
out of my face

Lauren lowers the shotgun A QUICK LOOK to the highway
ahead

LAUREN (0S
It’s coming up
(beat)
Thirty seconds

WHEELER RADIO
Fifteen

LAUREN 0S
That’s all it will take

Wheeler turns off the expressway onto Exit-41l

Maintaining a high speed he shoots on to

QUEENS - NORTHERN BLVD

WHEELER RADIO
I need to know where to go

LAUREN OS
I’1ll tell you when to turn

RIGHT - Looking out of the passenger window A flaming car
sits upside down in a gas station parking lot

DR WARD RADIO
This is wrong And you know it is
Doctor

Lauren ignores Dr Ward as she focuses on her neighborhood

DR WARD RADIO
Whoever you bring on I’m testing
If they fail they get the same
treatment

LEFT - A crashed pickup truck rests in the brick wall of a
CVS Pharmacy

Mass collection of DEAD BODIES pile up on the sidewalks
They lead to the Jackson Heights Medical Clinic

A car dealership comes up All the vehicles in the lot have
been looted and destroyed Each covered in a thick dust

LAUREN 0S
Slow down The turn’s a block past
the car lot A left at this gas
station

FORWARD - You see a large American flag waving upside down
atop a metal pole

Wheeler turns on to

77TH STREET

The narrow street is crowded with parked cars Seamless rows
of brick duplexes line the sidewalks Front yards are
minimal some only concrete

You WATCH out of the passenger window The houses flash by
ina blur This was once nice neighborhood now an abandoned
ghetto

LAUREN 0S
This one

WHEELER RADIO
With the garage

LAUREN OS
Yeah

Wheeler slows to a stop by the curb

RIGHT - Lauren’s house Bushes growing savage over the yard
A little garden sits hidden next to the two-step porch

WHEELER RADIO
Fifteen seconds

SPINNING REAR - Lauren looks to Dr Ward

LAUREN 0S
You and I both know she wasn’t
going to make it

Dr Ward eyeballs the shotgun He nods
LAUREN OS

Can I trust you to take this and
make sure he waits

Dr Ward nods again His shaky hand grips the shotgun

Lauren TURNS opening the passenger door She SLIDES out of
the seat onto the street She slowly approaches her home
Breathing increases in the radio And then you hear --

DR WARD 0S RADIO
Move over I’m driving now

WHEELER 0S RADIO
The hell you are --

BOOM You FLINCH at the sound of a shotgun BLAST

LOOKING BACK at the ambulance The driver side door opens
A Body THUDS on the asphalt And then the door SLAMS shut

Tires SQUEAL and roll a cloud of smoke on the road You
WATCH the ambulance drive away It pulls a sharp left
disappearing around a corner

BACK TO THE ROAD - Wheeler lies in the middle of the street
Right hand clutches his chest

JOGGING over to Wheeler’s side Lauren overshadows him as
you look DOWN His chest is split open with a hole
completely through the torso Buckshot speckles his suit

Wheeler’s lips quiver preparing his final words --
COUGH COUGH Spitting up blood as he falls limp Dead

Lauren BOWS her head for maybe a split second of silence and
then TURNING BACK towards the house

RUNNING along the sidewalk STOPPING at the front door
Lauren twists the knob -- Locked

LAUREN OS
Megan

She BANGS on the door

DOWN - In the porchside garden Bushes overgrown atop stone
lawn statues -- a Crowned Frog Garden Gnomes and Mushrooms

Lauren reaches to grab the frog A twist of the crown
reveals a key underneath

BACK TO THE DOOR sliding the key in the lock She turns the
knob It opens but there is still SOMETHING blocking it

Lauren thrusts a stiff shoulder into the door Using all of
her strength she plows a couch across the floor She runs
into

LAUREN’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM

LOOKING AROUND - Furniture stacked in front of the windows
DVD Player flat screen television and table lamps
disassembled on the floor Family photos of Lauren MEGAN
and her HUSBAND cocked sideways on the wall

LAUREN OS
Megan

Lauren CREEPS into the

DINING ROOM

Melted candles of various colors sit atop the dining table
Chairs are missing from the room

KITCHEN

Cupboards bare Fridge open and empty The dining room
chairs create a wooden barrier around --

MEGAN She bears a strong resemblance to her mother Dried
bloody tears streak her cheeks Eyes barely open

Clothing dirty unchanged for weeks She clutches a steel
butcher knife for protection

LAUREN 0S
Megan

Lauren APPROACHES the chairs

LAUREN 0S
Meg --

Megan responds voice weak and hardly audible

MEGAN RADIO
Stay away from me

Megan lifts the knife pointed directly at you

LAUREN OS
It’s me

MEGAN RADIO
Mom

After a brief inspection Megan drops the knife

Lauren slides the chairs away You LOWER as Lauren gives
Megan a long hug

MEGAN RADIO
Dad never came back

LAUREN OS
I’m here now You’re going to be
okay Have you ate anything

MEGAN RADIO
I can’t remember the last time I
had food

Lauren digs in her left pocket pulling out the food ration
bag She pops it open and offers it to Megan

LAUREN (0S
Here Eat this

Megan empties the bag’s contents in her hand She ravages
through the food like an animal

Lauren stands LOOKING around the kitchen She spots a
dishrag A quick grab and TURNING to the sink Twisting the
faucet -- No water

LAUREN OS
I’1l be right back to clean you up

Lauren rushes through the house into a

HALLWAY

Blood spots the carpeted floor She takes a few steps and
then cuts into the

BATHROOM

Shower tiles stained with mildew Toilet seat slightly
broken A dozen empty handsoap bottles scattered around

Lauren grabs the sink faucets trying both Nothing

As she comes up you SEE Lauren for the first time through
the medicine cabinet mirror She takes a moment to reflect

She MOVES to the shower and tries that knob Still nothing
LOOKING to the toilet It’s full of piss and there’s no way
shell use that

Lauren flips the tank lid off Porcelain CRACKS on the
floor INSIDE a cup worth of water if that She extends
the towel in soaking it all up

Lauren RUNS back into the

HALLWAY

Water drips on the floor from the hand towel as she returns
to the

KITCHEN

SLIDING DOWN to her knees Megan stops eating for a moment
as Lauren wipes the blood away from her face

Lauren notices Megan wants more

LAUREN (0S
Sorry Keep eating

Lauren pulls out her Mosquito She nervously presses a
button A needle extends out

LAUREN OS
I need test your blood okay

With a mouth full Megan simply nods Lauren jabs the needle
in Megan’s arm She STANDS UP turning away from Megan You
WATCH the blood slowly change to black

Lauren drops the Mosquito on the floor She begins to cry as
she GLANCES BACK at Megan There’s little hope now

LAUREN OS
I’m going get you to a safe area so
you won’t stay sick okay Stay
here I’11 be right back

Lauren RUNS frantically back into the

HALLWAY

And takes the next door past the bathroom into the

GARAGE

Shelves contain jugs of household and car fluids A large
chest freezer leaks water on the floor A sedan sits parked
facing the closed garage door Driver’s side open

Before getting to the car you SEE a blood trail going from
the driver’s door to the trunk Lauren suspiciously reaches
into the car pressing a button to pop the trunk

Lauren APPROACHES the rear of the car She opens the trunk

LAUREN OS
Nooo

You SEE a BODY inside one Lauren is familiar with -- her
HUSBAND He’s dead a victim of the virus Blood covers his
face Arms and hands scarred by deep gashes

Next to the body Lauren spots four torn pieces of paper and
a black permanent marker The papers are scribbled with
text Lauren pieces them together like a puzzle --

I LOCKED MYSELF HERE TO PROTECT HER PLEASE SAVE MY DAUGHTER
Lauren tugs her Husband out of the trunk You SEE his feet
drag on the garage floor QUICK LOOK to the freezer as she
opens the lid

Lauren musters all of her strength to pull her Husband’s body
up and into the freezer Once in she closes the lid

Lauren retreats to the car and grabs the permanent marker
You WATCH her write on top of the freezer

DAVID MICHAEL CHASE

Blood oozes from her mouth

MEGAN RADIO
Mom --

LAUREN RADIO

Megan raises the right arm Lauren secures that glove with

MEGAN OS
Dad said there was no gas

LAUREN RADIO
Get in the car and I’1l figure
something out

Megan AMBLES around the car She opens the passenger door
and SLIDES in

RIGHT - Out the side window you see Lauren desperately
collecting ALL containers on the shelf -- Window washing
fluid antifreeze and motor oil

OVER YOUR SHOULDER - Lauren cracks open the gas tank lid
She furiously empties every liquid inside Regardless what
damage it will do Rikers is only “one mile away”

LEFT - At the driver’s seat Waiting WATCHING And then
Lauren pops into the car She spins a series of keys around
finding the right one A quick jab in the ignition --

PUT-PUT-PUT-VROOOM The engine struggles to engage but it
finally does so

You WATCH Lauren aim a garage clicker at the door Before
pressing a button she realizes there’s no power

She STOMPS the gas The car JERKS forward and CRASHES
through the garage door Megan DUCKS and SCREAMS

LAUREN OS RADIO
It’s okay It’s just wood

You RISE back up looking through the windshield as the car
speeds northbound on

77TH STREET

Megan’s curiosity has you looking out of the LEFT window
And then a quick look through the RIGHT

You LOOK at the gauges Gas gauge flashes a red E with a
pump logo Speedometer breaks a hundred miles per hour and
rising

Lauren JERKS the wheel to miss an abandoned van in an
intersection

LEFT - Over Lauren’s arms you see a shopping center Like
plowed snow a pile DEAD BODIES peak in parking lot

RIGHT - Flashing through another intersection you see the
charred remains of a Jackson Heights metro bus

You begin to BOUNCE up and down as Megan has a coughing fit
inside the helmet

LAUREN OS RADIO
Hey Are you okay Look at me

SLOWLY TURNING to look at Lauren

LAUREN RADIO
Oh shit

She attempts to put more force on the gas pedal but it’s
already going through the floor

Megan returns your view to the front The road is ending
soon blocked by a concrete barrier

You BOB down and then pulled back UP like someone dozing
off Then finally you LOOK DOWN into Megan’s lap

Lauren’s focus is on the road A sharp turn right PUSHES
your view to the side A quick left BRINGS YOU BACK to the
center

LAUREN OS RADIO
Megan Wake up Come on

Lauren’s hand reaches in front of you She RAISES Megan’s
head Begging Pleading

LAUREN OS RADIO
Please We’re almost there

AHEAD - You see the ambulance taken Dr Cole It lies
overturned with all the Patient’s bodies scattered across
the road

CLANG BANG Pistons explode in the engine Grey smoke
rolls from underneath the hood The liquid have finally
taken its toll on the engine

Lauren releases her grip on the helmet to focus on the road
You DROP back down into Megan’s lap

SCREECH Tires brake hard on the asphalt You hear the
driver’s door open and Lauren rush out Footsteps run around
the car opening the passenger side

Lauren reaches under Megan’s legs and neck PULLING you from
the car

SPINNING AROUND with Lauren you WOBBLE as she runs towards
the Rikers Island Entrance on

NORTH HAZEN STREET

You SEE hundreds of PEOPLE still fighting for admission
through the Quarantine Wall

LAUREN OS RADIO
Someone Please Help me

A pair of patrolling GATE SOLDIERS notice Lauren They
sprint towards you

GATE INFECTEDS attempt chase after them --

PARAPAPAPAP Rifles from the other Gate Soldiers hold off
the onslaught long enough

The first SOLDIER to Lauren’s side radios for help

SOLDIER 10S RADIO
I need an E-vac vehicle at the gate
ASAP to pick up a viro

Lauren falls exhausted

You SLIDE onto the asphalt All that’s visible are the two
Soldiers boots running to you

One Soldier picks up Megan He backpedals away from Lauren

You SEE Soldier 2 with his rifle aimed at Lauren’s head
Finger a millionth of an inch away from pulling the trigger

SOLDIER 10S RADIO
Spare her

Lauren cries begging for mercy Soldier 2 hesitates before
he pulls back the rifle

SOLDIER 10S RADIO
I need you to make a hole for me to
get back through the gate

Soldier 2 puts his sights on the Crowd

ALL FOCUS is on Lauren as Soldier 1 carries Megan towards the
gate Nothing can be heard except the BURST of fifty rifles
shooting at the same time

Lauren on her knees waves a final goodbye as she disappears
from view behind the horde

The Quarantine Wall pulls closed

SPINNING AROUND in Solider 1’s arms A small prison van
stops next to you

Two DOCTORS both in blue biosafety suits step out of the
rear doors They rush to Soldier 1

SOLDIER 10S RADIO
This one was dropped off outside
the gate

DOCTOR 1 RADIO

attempt to verify Doctor 2 reads the stencil on the suit

REMOVING you from Megan’s head as the van speeds away

Wind picks you UP out of the rear doors

FLOATING through the air You SEE the van driving away
towards the island Radio strength fades away --

DOCTOR 1 0S RADIO
Doctor Chase Get a mosquito --

FALLING DOWN like a feather To the left then the right
TWIRLING seeing the stone columns beneath the bridge

A light SPLASH in the East River

GARGLE-GLUNK water bubbles into the hood

SINKING under the water --

STATIC BLACK OUT

Your view becomes cloudy with dense static flickering to
black The transmission is lost until --

UNDER WATER

You SEE a pile of sunken DEAD BODIES Everyone’s skin is
decomposed in thick patches from the water

And then --

END OF TRANSMISSION
