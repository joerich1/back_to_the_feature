FADE UP ON

The humming stillness of an American suburb on a summers
day nannies push strollers joggers jog mailmen deliver
dogs are walked kids shoot hoop in wide open driveways
On a quiet tree-lined street we pick up two young athletic-
looking boys riding bikes LASER ALLGOOD and his
friend CLAY Like bats out of hell they pass block after block of
charming evenly spaced houses until they round a corner and
drop their bikes in front of a large ranch house
INT CLAYS HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

They walk inside We HEAR a baseball game on TV in another
room
INT CLAYS BATHROOM - LATER

Clay pounds on blue pills with a hammer reducing them to
powder Laser watches
LASER
I dont know dude

Clay cuts the powder into lines with a school ID card
CLAY
B minus in geometry yo This
shits the bomb

Clay rolls up a dollar bill and takes a snort Then hands
the rolled up bill to Laser

CLAY (CONTD)
Add it up son
Laser takes the bill bends over and snorts a line

INT ALLGOOD HOUSE - GIRLS BEDROOM - DAY

Part Oxford reading room part teenage girls lair Leaning
against the bed we see JONI ALLGOOD Its her room
She pours over a game of Scrabble

Sitting next to Joni is her best girl friend SASHA Sashas checking out Jonis FACEBOOK PAGE

Jonis best guy friend JAI sits across from her
calculating his next Scrabble move

SASHA
Oh my God Joni there are so many
hotties in your class You are so
gonna hook up the first week

JAI
Just cause youre a 24 hour drive-
thru doesnt mean everyone else has
to be

SASHA
Hey she worked her ass off She
deserves some hot jock sausage
Jai looks repulsed and hurt

SASHA (CONTD)
(£lip)
Whatever Why dont you guys just
do it and get it over with

Joni and Jai blush Theyre both too scared to admit their
crush on each other
SASHA (CONTD)
What Im just asking

JAI
Uh maybe because were friends

SASHA
Oh really
Sasha turns to Joni like an agent provocateur

INT CLAYS HOUSE - TV ROOM - LATER
Laser and Clay wrestle on the floor while Clays DAD watches
a baseball game on TV They bump into the couch Clays dad
looks back menacing

CLAYS FATHER
Hey ladies Take it down a notch

The boys keep wrestling wired from the pills Again they
knock into the couch Clays dad spins around pissed
CLAYS FATHER (CONTD)
What did I just say

The Dad grabs Clay pulls him off of Laser and over the
couch He gets his son in a headlock forcing the boys face
into his big fat sweaty armpit Both Dad and Clay enjoy the
brutal play Clay laughs manically

CLAY
Let me go

CLAYS FATHER
Dont do the crime if you cant do
the time
CLAY
Dad your pits smell like burnt
ass Get off me
As Laser observes this male-bonding between father and son
we note a trace of longing on his face

NIC
(snapping)
Fine Do you want to answer his
question

JULES

Well sweetie human sexuality is
complicated And sometimes
peoples desires can becounter-
intuitive

(soldiering on)
For instance since womens sexual
responsiveness is mostly internal
sometimes its exciting for us to
see sexual responsiveness more you
know

(beat)
externalized

Laser looks at them still baffled

JULES (CONTD)
Like with a penis
LASER
But like wouldnt you rather watch
two women doing it
JULES
You would think that But in most
of those movies theyve hired two
straight women to pretend and the
inauthenticity is just unbeara--
NIC
Okay thats enough Laser your
mom and I have a sense theres some
other stuff going on in your life
and we just want to be let in

projections of your own junk And
instead of talking to each other
you go off the rails and act
grubby and make stupid choices

Which is what I did And I feel
sick about it because I love you
guys and I love your mom and thats
the truth Sometimes you hurt the
ones you love the most I dont
know why Maybe if I read more
Russian novels I would

Nic looks down overwhelmed by it all
JULES (CONTD)
Anyway I just wanted to say how
sorry I am about what I did and

The family drives home Jules is at the wheel Nics in the
passenger seat eyes red and puffy Lasers in the back

No one speaks everyones lost in their own worlds Finally
Laser breaks the spell

LASER
I dont think you guys should break
up
A long beat
NIC
No Whys that
LASER

I think youre too old

Both Nic and Jules crack smiles Their sons rudeness is

unsurpassed But then his words have an unexpected gravity

NIC
Thanks Laser

Jules disarmed and slightly smiling reaches over and puts
her hand on Nics leg She gives it a gentle squeeze and
doesnt let go Nic looks over to Jules finally disarmed

Nic reaches for Jules hand and holds it tight Nic and
Jules look at each other and then away

Laser watches his moms holding hands from the back seat
Their small gesture is what he needed He smiles to himself
grateful for a sign

FADE OUT
THE END
