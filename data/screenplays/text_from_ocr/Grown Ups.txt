Jo confronts McCusker

FROM MCCUSKERS POV - He stares down at the little spitfire
in his face - 13 YEAR OLD Jo

13 YEAR OLD JO
Youre his TEACHER I know that may not be
as much fun as your “Pumping Iron” days -
but since youve “fallen back” on teaching
youve got a responsibility to look after
these kids instead of sitting on your lazy
apathetic ass and doing nothing

McCusker is stunned

13 YEAR OLD RUSS
I tried this already honey

Jo sees Oliver walking away down the hall

JO

Chris Mullin

(reliving the horrors of his

youth)
He couldn’t swim to save his life but he
used to come after me every time I went
in the pool One time he stripped off my
bathing suit and hung it from the high
dive Half the school was there all the
girls I had to climb the high dive to
get it

Oliver shudders at the thought

OLIVER
Geez

RUSS
Yeah and it wasn’t easy climbing that
thing with one hand

Russ selects a piece of square cafeteria pizza along with a
side of fries Jo gives him a disapproving look

cafeteria Russ and Jo follow him

They walk down the aisle of tables each of them crowded with
the various cliques - the jock table the stoner table the
popular table etc’ Oliver doesn’t move to sit at any of them

INT MR SALOMONS OFFICE - NIGHT

The firm is dark and empty but Salomon’s desk lamp is on
Russ places the revised sketches on his boss’ desk

Suddenly Russ hears a TOILET FLUSH He’s not alone
Salomon’s working late

Panicked Russ looks around for a hiding place He tries to
wedge his body into the narrow leg space under Salomon’s desk

With pained effort he squeezes himself in banging his head
on the drawer above him

MR SALOMON enters the office Something doesn’t seem right
We follow his gaze as he leans down looking under his desk

FROM SALOMON’S POV - He sees 13 YEAR OLD RUSS crouching
comfortably under the desk They make eye contact

MR SALOMON
You What are you doing here

13 year old Russ crawls out from under the desk Salomon
looks down at him no patience for children

13 YEAR OLD RUSS
Uh uh

He spots a janitor cleaning up outside Salomons office

13 YEAR OLD RUSS (contd)
I got locked in the janitors closet

MR SALOMON
And what are you doing under my desk

13 year old Russ ducks under the desk again Pretends to
shoot Mr Salomon from under it making the gun noises with
his mouth Pschew Pschew ‘

Get out of there Who ARE you

13 year old Russ stands back up

13 YEAR OLD RUSS

Russ Newlander’s son Russ Jr

The truth is my Dad’s really sick He
can barely move a finger But he knew
‘getting you these revisions was more
important than ANYTHING At least that’s
what he said before he passed out

MR SALOMON
(not totally buying this)
Mm hmm So Newlander’s sick huh

13 YEAR OLD RUSS
Yeah he’s got shingles

MR SALOMON
(dubious)
Shingles
13 YEAR OLD RUSS

Er rickets I think it’s a combo of
the two But he’ll be back in a couple
of weeks

(pushing it)
Come to think of it he could really use
that health insurance at this point I
mean when he took this job no one ever
discussed a six month waiting period before
it started up It’s really not fair

MR SALOMON

Uh huh Look I don’t know what
exactly is going on here But you tell
your “sick” Dad I dont appreciate
employees who run away from their
responsibilities If he doesn’t deal
with his crew and get them back on
schedule by the end of the month hes
not going to have a job to come back to

13 YEAR OLD RUSS
You’re going to fire m him

(shaking his head)
No no no

-) OLIVER
Yeah I‘m like the last guy in the whole
school anybody would expect to do
something like that

RUSS
(back in full parental mode)
All right first of all its against the
law Second they have curfews for a
reason The last thing you should be
doing is trekking all over Boston
unsupervised That’s dangerous

(beat)
Have some faith in your son If you
don’t trust him how is he ever going to
trust himself

RUSS
I have faith in him Its the rest of
the world I don’t trust

Russ looks to Jo for back up She says nothing

POPPY
Look how confident he’s getting

RUSS
There’s a difference between being
confident and being out of control
(to Jomaking his point)
I mean he’s talking about sneaking out
of hotels and running around Boston at
all hours of the night with a flag

JO
Yeah I know about that

RUSS
You knew about that and you didn’t tell”me

Jo
Its an Emerson tradition

Russ turns back to Poppy

RUSS
Do you see this is what I’m talking
about Shes losing her mind I’m going
to lose my job Enough is enough You
have to change us back

A couple of PATRONS sitting nearby take notice of kuss
POPPY

You know as much fun as this is I really
should get home and meet the boy See

Poppy walks out leaving Russ and Jo alone Russ glares at Jo

JO
(explaining)
I haven’t been this close to Oliver since
he was five I mean he thinks I’m cool

RUSS
He thinks youre thirteen He doesn’t
know who you are We can’t parent him if
were kids

Jo
Thats not true Im helping him

RUSS
Right by hanging out with the coon
crowd That’s not what he needs
JO ‘
Oh and you know what our son needs
better than I do

The nearby patrons look at Russ and Jo perplexed Son

RUSS
Yes I do Because I’ve lived it I‘m

living it all over again

JO
I think Oliver throwing a party or for
that matter going on a field trip to
Boston is not the end of the world He
seems HAPPY to me

RUSS
Of course he SEEMS happy to you
Everybody SEEMS happy in the popular
clique But it never lasts Sooner or
later they’re going to dump him

JO
(defensive)
Hey just because some kids did that to
you doesn’t mean these kids are going to
do that to Oliver They’re not like that

a)

RUSS
Well I’m glad you have so much faith in
your little cheerleader friends

JO

Do you know how long it’s been since I’ve
had girlfriends ACTUAL girlfriends
Not women I work with Not the MOTHERS
OF MASSACHUSETTS Just girlfriends who
talk about stupid girl stuff I know
YOU don’t think it’s important but it’s
important to me

(beat)
Besides its refreshing to be around
people who are actually positive who
aren‘t constantly waiting for the other
shoe to drop

RUSS
(sarcasticdismissive)
Really because I thought all they talked
about were shoes

Jo turns to walk out Stops in the doorway and turns back
By now theyve attracted everybodys attention

Jo

You know what you were right I

wouldn’t have looked twice at you in

junior high
RUSS

Oo what does that mean Youre breaking
up with me
FROM THE PATRONS’ POV - They see 13 YEAR OLD JO in the doorway

13 YEAR OLD Jo

face with the hood

INT MASTER BEDROOM
A large group of 13 YEAR OLD BOYS crowd around the bed

FROM THE BOYS POV - 13 YEAR OLD RUSS is in mid sex talk
The boys listen intently They don’t want to know and yet
they can’t turn away

13 YEAR OLD RUSS
--That’s nothing Did you know urinary
tract infections can spread from person to
person And that means you‘re in for
burning incessant urinating and
sometimes even a discharge

The boys all cringe “Ewww”

13 YEAR OLD BOY

How do you know all this stuff

Russ smiles

RUSS

INT FAMILY ROOM INSIDE THE CLOSET

from the kids Nicole walks into the room with a Coke

RUSS
I’m sorry I don’t think ANY of your
parents would want you to be exposed to
that man’s “music”

OLIVER
Are you nuts Eminem is AWESOME

From NICOLES POV - She sees a confident 13 year old Russ
take a stand on Eminem

13 YEAR OLD RUSS
No he’s not “AWESOME” Hes a no-talent
opportunist taking advantage of the fact
that kids misinterpret foul language
violence and misogyny as “controversial”

Oliver and the other kids look at each other in stunned
silence Jo shakes her head embarrassed

RUSS
You guys wanna hear some awesome music

I’1l play you some

He pulls out a bunch of his OLD ALBUMS from a wall unit
Puts a record on the turntable “

The TALKING HEADS’ “Once In A Lifetime” suddenly blares
through the speakers Russ starts doing his best David Byrne

impression

karate chop on the arm the exaggerated running-in-place the
big suit-jacket shoulder move etc

like hes retarded Including Oliver and Jo

pool area

They peer through the window and discover Hannigan attacking
Oliver

Hannigan is still dunking Oliver The other kids yell even
try to intervene but Hannigan’s buddies keep them at bay
