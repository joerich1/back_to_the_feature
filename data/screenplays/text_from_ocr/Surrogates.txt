FADE IN ON
EXT CITY STREETS - NIGHT -- MOVING

A DISTORTED IMAGE of downtown city streets at night
This is not a FISHEYE LENS but the REFLECTION in the
mirrored surface of a helmet visor

EXT LUXURY BUILDING - NIGHT

A near-future MOTORCYCLE stops near a dramatic HIGH-RISE
RESIDENTIAL BUILDING The rider clad in black leather
climbs off his machine Well call him the ASSASSIN

He flips up his VISOR His face is scarred stubbly He
conceals himself in an alcove eyes never leaving the
buildings entrance

A uniformed DOORMAN opens the high-rises lobby door for
a HANDSOME YOUNG MAN in a TUXEDO and TRENCHCOAT

THE ASSASSIN has been waiting for this He removes what
looks like a rifle scope from his jacket aims it at

TUXEDO
SCOPE POV - focusing on TUXEDOS FACE magnified A
digital readout SCANNING Then a long SERIAL

NUMBER reads out and the name LIONEL ALEXANDER CANTER
along with other personal information below

THE ASSASSIN puts away the scanner scope satisfied He
reaches a hand into a pocket withdraws a mysterious
DEVICE The size of a first generation cellphone it has
a military look with a clear sliding panel over safety
switches and buttons
The ASSASSIN hurries toward TUXEDO but before he can

REACH HIM--
A sleek futuristic LIMOUSINE pulls up and TUXEDO gets in
the back Theyre gone in an instant

The ASSASSIN frustrated dashes for his MOTORCYCLE He
starts it and pursues the limousine

EXT WASHINGTON DC - NIGHT

THE MOTORCYCLE pursues the LIMOUSINE along the Potomac
D C LANDMARKS visible in the distance

EXT KENNEDY CENTER - NIGHT

FORMAL CROWDS a RED CARPET signs for an OPERA The
LIMOUSINE approaches

INT LIMOUSINE - NIGHT

TUXEDO leans forward to the DRIVER a muscular handsome
man in a suit named ARMANDO

TUXEDO
Im not really in the mood for
opera Armando
ARMANDO nods knowingly pulls back into traffic

ARMANDO
F Street

TUXEDO
(UNDOING BOWTIE)
You read my mind Lets not
mention this to my Dad
As he speaks he passes a few BILLS over the seat

EXT WAREHOUSE DISTRICT - NIGHT

THE LIMO moves through this seemingly deserted area
pulls up near a STEEL DOOR with a spray-painted X
TUXEDO emerges sans jacket and tie his dress-shirt open

TUXEDO
I can find my way back
ARMANDO nods and pulls away TUXEDO moves toward the
entrance says a word into an INTERCOM with a
SURVEILLANCE CAMERA The door opens within moments he
disappears inside
THE ASSASSIN parks his bike a few steps behind Tuxedo
has vanished through the STEEL DOOR before he can catch
up with him

The ASSASSIN takes off his helmet tries the door It
wont move He buzzes the intercom The DOOR slides
open a crack--
THE BOUNCER is a huge bald man with JET BLACK skin RED
EYES and TEETH that glow fluorescently The THROBBING
BEAT of MUSIC within The BOUNCER narrows his eyes

BOUNCER
This is a private club
ASSASSIN
just need to talk to--
THE STEEL DOOR has already shut in his face

INT THE PIT - NIGHT

POUNDING MUSIC BODIES SLAM together in a brutal mosh
pit MEN and WOMEN All are young some beautiful
others extremely decorated and pierced They tear at
each other brutally trying to do real damage On the
edges of the pit individual FISTFIGHTS go on An
incongruous CHANDELIER overhead gilt-edged MIRRORS on
the walls-- the FIGHTERS SLAM INTO and SHATTER them

A HARD-CORE BAND plays on an elevated stage The
MUSICIANS are heavily punked out in outlandish clothes
with pierced faces tattoos and body make-up

IN A VIP AREA a balcony elevated above the stage
numerous BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE at tables Many are making

out gay straight threesomes-- orgies happen up here
TUXEDO sits by himself He raises a GLASS TUBE attached
to a CORD one of a few leading into an ELECTRONIC DEVICE
on the table As he brings the tube close to his own
neck an ARC of electricity jumps to his skin His
features go slack a shudder goes through him Then he
lowers the tube with a smile Hes using a JACKER-- a
sort of electro-shock hookah A SHOUT over the MUSIC

BLONDE
Mind if I join you
A stunningly beautiful BLONDE in edgy dramatic clothes
stands nearby Tuxedo recovering from the hit gestures
graciously for her to sit She picks up one of the
cords gives him a sly smile She opens her mouth
SPARKS fly to her tongue and--

Cut TO

EXT ALLEYWAY - NIGHT

RAIN pours down as TUXEDO and the BLONDE burst out the
door laughing He pushes her against a brick wall they
grope each other hungrily hands inside clothes getting
drenched in the warm downpour

WITH THE ASSASSIN wearing his HELMET with the VISOR UP
as he approaches the entwined couple TUXEDO hears him

TURNS --

TUXEDO
Get lost meatbag

EXT WAREHOUSE DISTRICT - NIGHT

ANGLE ON the alleys mouth as we hear the BLONDES
SCREAM Seconds later she staggers out clutching her
head and collapses to the pavement We hear an ENGINE
START from the alleyway

THE ASSASSIN emerges on his bike rides directly over her
body unconcerned-- and ROARS into the night
CAMERA PULLS UP to--

EXT WASHINGTON DC - NIGHT

--an AERIAL VIEW of the rain-swept CITY some futuristic
HIGH-RISES amongst the recognizeable landmarks Also a
great number of SUPER-CELL TOWERS and DISHES
considerably larger than the ones we see today

CAMERA PICKS UP SPEED moves quickly to a run-down part
of the city tenements and vacant lots MOVE DOWN and
through a third-story window of--

INT ABANDONED PROJECT BUILDING - NIGHT

A dark decaying hallway A MAN and a WOMAN move
stealthily up the stairs LASER-SIGHT GUNS in hand

The man is THOMAS GREER the woman JENNIFER PETERS Both
are about 30 handsome athletic Greers spent his life
in law enforcement Hes smart and able wants things to
make sense-- but as the world changes around him he
feels hes losing the thread PETERS is junior to Greer
her attitudes professional but rigid by the book

GREER in the lead waves PETERS up They approach a
door at the end of the hall We see now that their
windbreakers read FBI
GREER kicks open the door--

INT PSYCHOS LAIR - NIGHT

Lit by CANDLES and KEROSENE LANTERNS SMOKE HANGS in the
room We glimpse BODIES hanging from the ceiling in
CHAINS GREER and PETERS train their LASERS around the
place disturbed by the scene A flash of MOVEMENT in a
bedroom and a CRASH--

THE PSYCHO who lives here has kicked over a LANTERN FIRE
spills across the floor We glimpse a surprisingly good-
looking guy grinning maniacally He dashes across the
ROOM- -
GREER squeezes off a couple of SHOTS The PSYCHOs too
fast he LEAPS through a cracked WINDOW

EXT ABANDONED PROJECTS - NIGHT

RAIN has let up The PSYCHO FALLS thirty feet into a
pile of soft DIRT and TRASH He rolls to the bottom
gets to his feet and runs

GREER looks down from the broken window

INT PSYCHOS LAIR - NIGHT

PETERS is beating at the FLAMES with a towel sees Greer
is preparing to jump

PETERS
Lets call for back-up

GREER
Wheres the sport in that

PETERS

ITS PROTOCOL--
GREER SNORTS and--

EXT ABANDONED PROJECTS - NIGHT

--LEAPS GREER hits the dirt hard and rolls He reaches
the ground and sets off after the PSYCHO at top speed

PLAY A FRANTIC FOOT CHASE both men scramble over chain-
link fences leap over trashed cars
GREER pursues the PSYCHO around a corner into a
passageway between buildings--
--wherethePSYCHO gets the jump on him SWINGS a length
of pipeathis head Greer ducks fast the blow catches
him inthearm he drops his gun The PSYCHO moves to
pick uptheweapon but Greer tackles him against a
dumpster

Greer SLAMS the dumpster lid on the man repeatedly

GREER
You have the right to remain silent--
But the PSYCHO has grabbed something from the trash
manages to SQUIRT BUG SPRAY in Greers eyes
Greers blinded temporarily the PSYCHO squirms away
running from between buildings across a street--
WHAM Hes hit full-on by a SEMI his body FLIES through
the air He LANDS HARD on cement but amazingly is still
alive He tries to get up but--
GREER plants a foot on his chest and holds him fast
against the ground Greer still wiping at this eyes
points his weapon at the PSYCHOs head

GREER (CONTD)
Stay with me asshole--

PSYCHO
Why would I do that
The PSYCHO grins-- then his head lolls back eyes empty

INT PSYCHOS LAIR - NIGHT

PETERS is by a WOMANS BODY on the floor holding a
pocket SCANNER close to her head This small device
resembles an iPhone Theres tape over the womans eyes
and mouth which Peters peels away as she speaks into a
tiny cellphone earpiece

PETERS
Is this Kathy Welles My name
is Jennifer Peters with the FBIs
surrogate crime division

ON SCANNER-- the name KATHY WELLES REPORTED STOLEN
contact information below
EXT ABANDONED PROJECTS - NIGHT

ON GREERS SCANNER - NEW-U RENTAL AGENCY with an ID
NUMBER but no name

GREER kneels beside the PSYCHOs body pockets his
scanner Hes angry but resigned he was half expecting
this

THE SEMI DRIVER is still behind the wheel of his rig He
calls out to Greer

SEMI DRIVER
Am I in trouble

GREER
(waves him off)
Nah go back to work
GREER rises as his PHONE CHIMES he touches his earpiece
IN BG the DRIVER pulls away

GREER (CONTD)
PETERS (FILTER)

GREER
Hes a rental
He disconnects reaches to turn the PSYCHOs head to one
side The back of his skull is smashed Instead of gore
and brains we see torn GRAY PLASTIC and dense CIRCUITRY
oozing pinkish hydraulic fluid at his neck
Were in a world of SURROGATES remotely operated
synthetic humans (also known as SYNTHs) These are not
artificially-intelligent robots-- each is linked directly
to a human being miles or hundreds of miles away
Surrogates are distinguishable from flesh-and-blood
humans primarily by their physical perfection-- ugly
surrogates are rare On closer look their eyes may have
an inhuman quality Without a human mind sending and
receiving impulses they are completely inert
Suddenly the PSYCHO comes to life spins his head around
at an impossible angle and BITES GREERS HAND

He wont let go Greer stomps on the-PSYCHOs head
reaches with his other hand into the back of the skull to
wrench out a CIRCUIT BOARD The PSYCHO finally stops
writhing disconnected

INT PSYCHOS LAIR - NIGHT

PETERS talks on the phone while scanning a SEVERED HEAD

PETERS
I dont recommend reconnecting
Ms Welles hello

The WOMAN on the floor TWITCHES her eyes open She sits
up on her elbows looks down to see--

--her legs are gone The bottom half of her is missing
her tattered T-shirt covers the damage soaked with dark
green and pink liquids-- coolant and hydraulic fluids

VICTIM
Aw crap Im totalled

PETERS
Your insurance ought to cover it

EXT ABANDONED PROJECTS - NIGHT

GREER trudges toward the building on his cell leaving
the body behind He turns the CIRCUIT BOARD over in his
fingers

GREER
--trash pick-up on Maple and 4th

CUT TO
EXT WAREHOUSE DISTRICT - NIGHT

nearby Greer holds his SCANNER near her head

GREER (CONTD)
Registered to a Cameron Michaels
out in Clarksburg

(TO UNIFORM)

UNIFORM

GREER is leaning closer to the dead Blondes face
X-CLOSE-- CRACKS in the GLASS of her eye We see GREERS
FRAGMENTED REFLECTION as he peers at this

GREER
Optics are damaged

PETERS
Musta cracked when she fell

(TO UNIFORM)

The UNIFORM leads GREER and PETERS past the blonde into
the alley

INT ALLEYWAY - NIGHT

TUXEDO lies on his side eyes closed We can hear MUSIC
THROBBING from within

UNIFORM
Couldnt get an ID from this one
GREER kneels by Tuxedo looks at his fancy CUFFLINKS

GREER
A tux Kind of over-dressed for a
jacker joint
GREER pulls out his scanner
BY TUXEDOs FACE the SCANNER reads NO SIGNAL
GREER seems surprised PETERS looks over his shoulder

PETERS
Maybe hes real

GREER
Little too pretty for that
GREER lifts one of Tuxedos eyelids-- CLOSE shattered
GLASS ELECTRONICS visible within

GREER (CONTD)
Hes synth all right

PETERS
Looks like the optics exploded
Greer reaches behind Tuxedos head pulls out a small
specially-shaped TOOL and pries up the PANEL at the back
of Tuxedos skull He pulls out--

THE CIRCUIT BOARD melted and scorched

GREER
So much for the identity chip

PETERS
Ill call for a pick-up Maybe
diagnostics can make sense of it
Greer stands up looks toward the Blondes body

GREER
Clarksburgs just up the 270

PETERS
(a glance at her watch)
You always work these kind of
hours

GREER
Got something better to do

PETERS

Besides sleep

Greer is already on the move Peters reluctantly follows
CUT TO

EXT 270 - NIGHT

A slightly futuristic sedan speeds through light late-
night traffic We hear the VOICE of the PROPHET

PROPHET (RADIO)
You feel you are free You can be
what you want do what you want
nothing can hurt you But you have
ceased to live

INT FBI CAR - NIGHT

GREER drives PETERS has her eyes closed in the
passenger seat THE VOICE on the RADIO continues IN BG
through scene

GREER

Welcome back

PETERS

Prophet We oughta lock this guy

crimes against surries nationwide--
GREER

Dreads
PETERS
They dread the present they dread

THE FUTURE--

GREER

job out there Whyd you transfer

PETERS
D Cs the heart of the action

the same office it got a little

uncomfortable

(BEAT)
You get along with your last
partner

GREER

was that old

PROPHET (RADIO)
-But this I promise soon the
abominations shall fall where they
stand and on that day of
resurrection the dead shall rise

EXT MODERN APARTMENTS - NIGHT

MOVE ACROSS the facade of a suburban apartment complex

A RED GLOW suffuses most of the windows all of which are
BARRED In this warm light we glimpse OPERATORS in
reclining chairs motionless They could be watching TV
but no sets are in sight

MOVE TO FIND GREER and PETERS as they exit the sedan and
pass a sign SURROGATE-READY UNITS AVAILABLE

INT MODERN APARTMENTSCORRIDOR- NIGHT

GREER and PETERS walk along an almost prison-like
corridor SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS heavy doors They follow
an empty-faced walking MANNEQUIN in an ugly pantsuit
This is the LANDLADY Her mouth moves like a
ventriloquists dummy as she speaks self-consciously

LANDLADY

surrie this is just a loaner Is
there some kind of trouble

GREER
Nothing to worry about

LANDLADY

INT CAMS APARTMENT - NIGHT

The LANDLADY undoes the MULTIPLE LOCKS on the door of a
small one-room apartment She opens it and lets GREER
and PETERS inside A RED GLOW from the far end of the
room-- GREER flicks on overheads The Landlady hovers by
the door as they move into the place

Its minimalist nothing on the walls Empty pizza
boxes Skirts stockings high-heels strewn around
haphazardly We also glimpse a large CHARGING CRADLE
contact points embedded in the foam inside shaped to
accomodate a curvaceous female body

GREER
Hello
A fat hairy arm hangs over the side of a high-tech
CHAIR The two feds move quickly to see--
--CAMERON MICHAELS a 40-ish overweight bald male in
his underwear BLOOD runs from his nose his face
twitches slightly he lies in a STIM CHAIR

STIM CHAIRS resemble-oversized massage chairs contoured
to the body with padded head supports They vibrate and
electronically stimulate the user to prevent atrophy
A SENSORY PROJECTOR sits beside the chair This device
looks like a COMPUTER TOWER Its linked to an elaborate
HEADSET with contact points around the skull Theres
also a MONITOR SCREEN which displays the operators
remote POV

LANDLADY
Oh my God Cameron--
GREER quickly detaches the headset rips a small
ELECTRONIC SLEEVE off of Camerons fingertip He checks
the mans pupil response and pulse

GREER
Call the paramedics
While Peters calls in BG GREER moves to the PROJECTORS
MONITOR SCREEN and taps a touchpad
ON SCREEN - STATIC GREER REWINDS to POVs at the hard-
core CLUB FAST FORWARD to the ALLEY making out with
TUXEDO This is a recording of recent experience as
seen through the eyes of the BLONDE
GREER switches to real-time Tuxedo breaks the kiss and
turns to look OS

TUXEDO (ON SCREEN)

Get lost meatbag

As Tuxedo turns back TO CAMERA we hear a hideous
ELECTRONIC SCREECH Tuxedos face contorts in pain and
his EYES BURST fragments of GLASS and ELECTRONICS fly
The POV reels we hear the Blondes SCREAM-- and STATIC
again fills the screen

GREER is disturbed by this looks again at the
unconscious quivering face of the man in the chair
CUT TO
INT DC SUBWAY - NIGHT

A mostly empty car scattered SURRIE PASSENGERS ride

Shitpuppetsl Abominations
He moves to a YOUNG COUPLE both slack-faced on standby

DREAD (CONTD)
Wake up and smell the piss
He starts to UNZIP in front of them

GREER

The DREAD turns-- GREER is holding up a BADGE The Dread
scowls zips up and moves away from Greer plunks down at
the end of the car Greer pockets his badge calmly

EXT GREERS BUILDING - DAWN

saw on Cameron Michaels RED LIGHT suffuses the room

GREER a surrogate we now realize undresses puts his
clothes aside in a CLOSET-- which also contains a foam-
filled CHARGING CRADLE Down to his underwear he backs
into this seems to relax We hear a low HUM and--
--the REAL GREERs eyes open He disconnects the HEADSET
and FINGERSLEEVE the RED GLOW is replaced by WHITE
LIGHT He sits up yawns and sips the water He rises
wearily stretches runs a hand through his thinning
hair He moves to shut the closet door on his synth
unit As it CLOSES--

finishing the food his surrogate brought home As he
empties the remains into the trash--

Her TOAST pops up Maggie takes it with her coffee out
of the room She shakes her head amused at Greers
crazy ideas

MAGGIE (CONTD)
Sleep well
She takes her breakfast through a door in the hall just
off the kitchen-- we cant see inside the room We hear
the DOOR LOCK behind her
GREER looks after his wife a bit dejected In the quiet
he registers a voice from the TV

PETERS at the other (much neater) desk leans in to look
over Greers shoulder while the file uploads

PETERS
You sound pleased

GREER
Well you get a little tired of
property crime vandalism--

PETERS
Thought you took your job
seriously Surrogates are
extensions of peoples selves--—

GREER
What are you quoting VSI

PETERS
The Supreme Court
ANTHONY STONE Greers BOSS has entered Greers office
during the above Hes silver-haired friendly in
perfect shape-- another surrogate Hes clearly heard
this argument before

PETERS (CONTD)
Synthetic units have the same
rights as biologicals

GREER
Yeah yeah Fact is most of the
people you refer to as Dreads are
just too poor to afford a synth
You think they like living on
reservations

PETERS
Thats humanist propaganda The
restricted areas were their idea
they hate being around surries

STONE
Get a room you two
He leans between them hits a button on Greers computer
ON SCREEN - A NEW HAVEN PD LOGO at the top of the screen
indicating this is an EVIDENCE FILE In a large WINDOW
TUXEDOS POV RECORDING plays We now see the foreplay in

PETERS

(WINCES)
What could do that to someone

STONE
Lightning strike according to
forensics A massive power surge
shoots through the network

GREER
Two people in a narrow alley
surrounded by fire escapes cell
towers

STONE
Got a better idea In any case
lets be discreet about this
Therell be panic in the streets
if the public gets the idea that
using their surries can kill
them
Greer is rewinding the IMAGE He points to the face of
the ASSASSIN partly shielded within his helmet They
only get a partial of his face it ENLARGES and

CANTER

What progress have you made with

GREER
I cant help noticing your
surrogate-- its very similar to

the unit your son was using

Canter pauses then moves to a DOOR and opens it- LIGHTS
INSIDE FLICKER ON revealing--

--a WALK-IN CLOSET with a half-dozen CHARGING BAYS Four
surrogates here all versions of the man weve just seen--
Canter at different stages of life from youth to almost
elderly Two of the charging bays are empty

CANTER
I allowed Tony to borrow one of my
surrogates when he wanted to spend
time in DC I encouraged him to
take advantage of the cultural

OFFERINGS--

PETERS
Wait how is that possible
Arent your surries locked to your
neural signature

CANTER
(closing the door)
I wrote the code that remains at
the core of all surrogates It
wasnt difficult for me to make my
synth units accessible to my son

GREER -
Like getting the keys to dads car

CANTER
I suppose

(BEAT)
The coroner says that Tony was
online when it happened Why
hasnt the surrogate been returned
to me

PETERS
Were still analyzing the damage--
CANTER
It was attacked

PETERS
We really cant get into the details
of an ongoing investigation--

GREER
Dr Canter-- we dont know of any
way to kill an operator remotely
Do you

CANTER
No but-- at the beginning all of
us at VSI were worried about it
Its why every surrogate has a
built-in fail-safe they disconnect
before they can transmit a
potentially dangerous signal

PETERS
Can you think of anyone who might
want to harm your son

CANTER
I the sad fact is Tony and I
were just getting to know each
other he grew up with his
mother in California
Canters voice drifts off hes starting to look far
away pained He sits slowly behind his desk

CANTER (CONTD)
If this wasnt an accident then

its because of me that hes

(BEAT)
Im sorry Youll have to excuse me

Before Greer and Peters can reply Canter goes rigid
eyes blank-- hes disconnected

GREER
Guess the interviews over

PETERS

(QUIETLY)
Can you imagine what its like to
lose your only child
Greer scribbles something on a BUSINESS CARD

GREER
Not really You got kids

PETERS
(shakes her head)
Jim and I talked about it but

GREER
Lot of that going around
He starts to place the card on the desk before the
immobile Canter Armando steps forward warily-- Greer
shows him the card before putting it down

GREER (CONTD)
If he thinks of anything else

ARMANDO

(NODDING)
Ill show you out
As they move back toward the lobby elevator we remain
with the motionless Canter a beat Then the CAMERA
MOVES quickly from the study and THROUGH A WALL to find--

INT CANTERS PENTHOUSECONTROL AREA - DAY

--a small PRIVATE AREA bathed in RED LIGHT with a very
fancy elaborate SENSORY PROJECTOR REAL CANTER is much
older than his surrogate his face stubbly His body is
twisted and nearly useless his head held up by a brace
A victim of some horrible degenerative disease Canter
only has the use of one arm via an elaborate electronic
armature Hes just disconnected his HEADSET There are
TEARS streaming down his cheeks

His projector SCREEN faces him with his working arm he
calls up an old MEMORY FILE

GREER
Someone targeted Canters surrie

EARS as it rolls calmly away from his car

GREER (CONTD)
Im sure the guys got enemies he
never even heard of

PETERS

Greer rips the TICKET from the windshield tears it in

get in

INT VSI LOBBY - DAY
MOVE OVER a DISPLAY depicting the HISTORY OF SURROGATES

MODELS are arranged chronologically from primitive-
looking obvious ROBOTS moving stiffly to ANIMATED
MANNEQUINS (like the landlady) to the MODERN UNITS
almost indistinguishable from human beings whose
repetitive movements are smooth fully articulated

GREER and PETERS in plainclothes move past the display
Greer stops in his tracks seeing--

A DISPLAY that reads BREAKING THE MINDS CODE A
VIDEO LOOP shows a young CANTER (much like his surrogate)
seated at a worktable with ELECTRONIC GEAR beside a
SUBJECT lying on a table hundreds of WIRES affixed to
his head These lead to a crude MANNEQUIN which turns
its head rolls its eyes moves its mouth We hear a
VIDEO NARRATOR volume low

VIDEO NARRATOR
Dr Lionel Canters breakthrough
experiments led to the technology
for decoding brain impulses and
transferring the signals to
synthetic humans

GREER
Damn Why didnt I think of that
The two of them move on to an ELEVATOR BANK

INT VSI CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

A GORGEOUS ASSISTANT with plenty of cleavage enters with
two cups of coffee She takes them to GREER and PETERS
who sit at the table in this dramatic conference area

PETERS
Thank you

ASSISTANT
Mr Welch will be with you in a minute

(SHIMMIES OUT)
PETERS
Shes a little over the top

GREER
Just advertising the product
(sips his coffee)
Ugh

PETERS
Its delicious if you want it to be
Adjust your interface

GREER
Right I keep forgetting that

(ANOTHER SIP)
Mmm So good
They rise as--

--VICTOR WELCH enters Like most everyone else hes
30ish handsome a slick PR man in a suit Behind him
are a MALE and FEMALE LAWYER unsmiling All wear ID
BADGES around their necks with the VSI logo

WELCH
Agents Greer and Peters Im Victor
Welch VP corporate relations
He shakes their hands

PETERS
Thanks for taking the time to see us

WELCH
No problem Do you happen to know
Andy Stone

GREER
Our immediate superior
WELCH
Really Do give him my regards--
The MALE LAWYER cuts him off leaning across the table to
shake hands

MALE LAWYER
Were from the legal department

FEMALE LAWYER
Hope you dont mind if we sit in

PETERS
Not at all I didnt get your names--

WELCH

(OVER HER)
You might be interested in a free
software upgrade were offering to
all law enforcement officials
better night vision for your synth
unit improved pursuit capability

GREER
Mm Any idea what could cause a
surrogates head to explode from
the inside
On the table in a plastic EVIDENCE BAG is a fried
CIRCUIT-BOARD along with a pair of SHATTERED EYEBALLS
Greer passes this to Welch who barely looks at it

MALE LAWYER
Mr Welch isnt qualified to answer
that question Youd be better off
speaking to one of our technicians
WELCH smiles pleasantly

FEMALE LAWYER
What does the operator say

GREER
Not much Hes dead

PETERS
A massive brain hemmorhage it
happened while he was online

FEMALE LAWYER
Im sorry to hear that But I can
assure you it has nothing to do with
VSI products If a man suffers a
heart attack while driving he
doesnt have a case against the
automobile manufacturer
WELCH nods in agreement GREER gamely continues to
address his questions to the VP

GREER
No ones talking lawsuit wed
just like to know is there any
precedent for an operator being
killed by signals from his
synth unit

MALE LAWYER
(ALMOST INDIGNANT)
NONE WHATSOEVER--

FEMALE LAWYER
The idea is absurd If it were
possible it would defeat the
purpose of surrogacy

MALE LAWYER

Surries have jumped from bridges
been shot or blown to bits without
the least harm to the operators-
the fail-safes always kick in
Every case thats been brought
against VSI has been shown to be
the result of user negligence

FEMALE LAWYER
We cant help it if customers forget
to eat sleep or take their medicine
WELCH shrugs and rises followed by the lawyers

WELCH
If thats all a pleasure
talking with you

GREER
There is one more thing The victim
was Anthony Canter The son of one
of your companys founders
GREER studies them as they process this news

GREER (CONTD)
Kind of a strange coincidence

WELCH
Dr Canter has retired but well
be sure to send our condolences

A TV plays above his bed Greer blinks squints at this
ON TV - a small BOY CLIMBS a very tall TREE above a
suburban sidewalk pleasant MUSIC Suddenly a BRANCH
BREAKS the boy tumbles with a CRY

GREER winces distastefully

ON TV - now we see the BOY again perfectly fine
standing beside his mother She strokes his head with a
smile They look down at his broken SURROGATE on the
ground beside the fallen BRANCH

GREER watching the screen addresses Maggie

GREER

MAGGIE
(not looking up)
Hm Do what

GREER
Get a surrogate for our kid Our
hypothetical kid

MAGGIE
Sure Why not Theyre getting
cheaper all the time

COMMERCIAL V0
A world where every child is
secure and fulfilled

ON TV - A LITTLE GIRL swings back and forth a blissed-
out smile on her face

free of pain fear and

anxiety

IN SLO-MO she releases at the top of the swings arc and
flies into the air

COMMERCIAL VO (CONTD)

That world can be real Thanks to

THE LITTLE GIRL lands hard but gets up laughing

Not like its an issue

AT THE DOOR PETERS hovers making up her mind to enter
She steps into the room

PETERS
Knock knock
Greer blinks at her

GREER
Whos there-

( 2)

PETERS
ts me Peters

GREER
(almost to himself)

thought you mightve been
telling another joke

Peters seems relieved Maggie waits for an introduction
but Greer seems withdrawn shy-- Peters has never seen
his physical body

MAGGIE

PETERS
A pleasure to meet you

Jennifer
Peters

(STUDYING GREER)
You look just like your unit

GREER
Except older and fatter Sorry if
I seem a little out of it

PETERS
Youve been through a lot

GREER
Theyre calling it a concussion--
felt like my head was going to
explode
With a brisk RAP on the doorframe STONE enters

STONE
How ya feeling Greer

GREER shrinks back in his bed

GREER
You tell me Hows Lopez
Stone sighs looking him over Quietly

STONE
The pilot They found him dead in
his stim chair Same with one of
the Baltimore cops others ina
coma Four Dreads were killed on
the ground half a dozen wounded
Greer closes his eyes in misery

PETERS
Its not your fault You were doing
your job
Stone pulls up Maggies chair sits as he speaks

STONE
I would have to disagree You
requisitioned that chopper without
authorization You violated our
treaty with the Dreads-- were
expecting retaliation Those poor
cops had no idea what they were up

AGAINST--

GREER
None of us did We still dont
know I dont think Strickland
even knew-- he thought he was just
taking down the abominations

STONE
Im sorry Greer but- - youre
suspended pending further action
Greer nods slowly knew this was coming PETERS takes a
step back looking on carefully Greer takes his LAPTOP
COMPUTER off the bedside table opens it so that Stone
can see it

GREER
Ive been going through my memory
files of the crash ever seen

anything like this before

ON SCREEN - a magnified CLOSE-UP of the DEVICE in
STRICKLANDS HAND as he points it upward at the
helicopter

PETERS
Its the murder weapon
GREER nods STONE studies the laptop sets his jaw

STONE
Its more than that It means
nobody is safe The Dreads want
us all to be like them-- living in
fear no better than animals And
weve only just freed ourselves
begun to explore our true
potential

GREER
We need to get this guy

STONE
We will Our way of life will be
protected whatever it takes
An attractive SURRIE NURSE enters the room

NURSE
Good news Mr Greer The doctors
say you can go home today

GREER
(nervous thrown)
They said the end of the week--

NURSE
Insurance you know
She smiles putting his clothing by the bed and
disconnecting him from the IV and monitors

STONE
Just take some time to heal

GREER
What about my surrogate

STONE
Hasnt been-recovered Im afraid
we cant supply you with a new one
until this matter is resolved
Peters make sure he gets home in
one piece
PETERS nods looking at Greer sympathetically GREER
sinks back into his pillow anxious

ON MEDICAL MONITOR - the image of GREERS BRAIN shuts OFF
with a BLIP

EXT HOSPITAL ENTRANCE - DAY

PETERS strides from the doors GREER follows dressed in
casual clothes then slows his pace breathing hard
GREERS POV - CARS zipping past on the street RUSHING
PEDESTRIANS PARAMEDICS pushing a body past on a gurney
From Greers now human perspective surrogates seem
artificial appearance too perfect eyes empty of souls
This should be reeling vertiginous

PETERS pauses seeing Greer is having a panic attack He
has trouble speaking

GREER
havent been out without a
surrogate in a long time

PETERS
ts OK Nothings gonna happen

GREER
They wanted to give me something
for the anxiety they call it
corporeaphobia

PETERS

Just take my arm

He shakes his head takes a deep breath and moves out
onto the sidewalk Peters stays close

GREERS POV - SURRIE PEDESTRIANS moving quickly seeming
to come right at him One bumps into him--

GREER staggers the surrie moves on as if he hasnt even
noticed Greer moves toward the curb to get away from
them stumbles-- PETERS has to pull him out of CAR
TRAFFIC a HORN HONKS Hes sweating terrified

GREER

PETERS
We need to get you a replacement
She takes his arm forcibly and moves him away

THE SALESMAN hits a couple of switches slips a small
SLEEVE over GREERS FINGER its wired to the projector

SALESMAN (CONTD)
Take a whirl
Greer touches his fingers together--- his body instantly
goes limp and--
-a pale hairless SURRIE TEMPLATE in a speedo steps out
of a CHARGING BAY Its head is unfinished a mechanical
version of a skinless face Around its neck is a sign
that reads 40 OFF

SALESMAN (CONTD)
Looking gooood

40 OFF

The VOICE is a tinny far-away sounding version of
Greers Suddenly 40 OFF twitches and stumbles bumping
into a DISPLAY

40 OFF pokes himself in the eye

SALESMAN (CONTD)
Good good Takes some time to
break in Base model come with

walk down the street without
completely freaking out

INT BAR - DAY

A BARTENDER puts a SODA WATER and a GLASS OF SCOTCH on
the bar in front of PETERS and the shaky GREER

PETERS
Well you made it a block

GREER
(lifts his glass)
Heres to self-medication
He takes a sip and spits it out The BARTENDER turns

BARTENDER
Are you all right sir

GREER
What is this
The BARTENDER gives him a once-over

BARTENDER
Oh sorry We dont get a lot of--
thats synthohol Just a CPU
inhibition blocker in a non-
corrosive solution
As the bartender speaks Greer looks around the dark bar--
--in the back EVERY COUPLE is gazing into each others
eyes clearly hooking up
GREER continues to watch the other patrons

GREER
You have any real booze

BARTENDER
No liquor license

The BARTENDER shrugs and moves off Peters sips her soda
water amused

PETERS
Come here often stranger

GREER
You know they really dont look
human You cant tell when youre
inside them but
GREER turns to PETERS studies her like the others

PETERS
I dont like the way youre

looking at me

GREER
But Im not really looking at you

PETERS
Yeah yeah this is just a lump of
aluminum and polystyrene Tell
you what next time youre in
Colorado look me up for real We
can have a beer together

GREER
Id like that
PETERS blinks Greer has suddenly
He looks away

GREER (CONTD)
You know when we started working
together I thought you were kind
of a stiff

PETERS
New job I was defensive

GREER
Its more than that youre
different Or maybe I am

gotten sincere on her

Greers embarrassed shrugs it off He puts down a bill

and rises

GREER (CONTD)
You probably oughta head back to
the office

PETERS
I can get you home

GREER
Ill be OK

He moves toward the door she tags along
GREER (CONTD)

GREER (CONTD)
Was it always this steep

PETERS
Jesus Tom the rez

GREER
Since Im stuck in my skin I
oughta take advantage of it Hell
as long as Strickland has that
device-- Im safer this way
He clutches the handrail starts moving down

PETERS
Be careful
He nods and waves as he disappears down the escalator

Cut TO

INT FBI BUILDINGLOBBY - DAY

PETERS enters this large lobby bustling with other
AGENTS and OFFICIALS She moves toward a DESK JOCKEY
security SCANNERS She reacts to the sound of--

--SCREAMS and SCREECHING TIRES from outside the building
PETERS looks toward a large WINDOW to the street-- and
immediately dives for cover as--

--a battered SUV spray-painted with anti-surrogate
GRAFFITI SMASHES through the plate glass SURRIE
PEDESTRIANS are plastered across the grill and embedded
in the windshield

THE SUV slams into a few SURRIES in the lobby sends them
flying or runs over them It spins sideways into a WALL
with the FBI SEAL overhead

The DRIVER leaps out armed with a MACHINE GUN Hes
clearly a DREAD angry and deranged He starts SHOOTING
at anything that moves
PETERS crouches for cover as BULLETS shatter GLASS and
smash MARBLE around her
An army of AGENTS burst from an elevator in Kevlar and
riot helmets armed with AUTOMATIC RIFLES They
instantly bring the DREAD down in a barrage of gunfire
The agents move to the DREADS BODY-- hes very dead
pouring BLOOD from dozens of bullet wounds One speaks
into his headset

RIOT AGENT

(TO CROWD)
Any biologicals here

CUT TO

of the attack on the FBI building PILES of surries
removed on carts one BODY on a stretcher

NEWS READER VOICE

--twenty-seven surrogates irreparably
damaged Only one dead the attacker
himself

(MORE )

NEWS READER VOICE (CONTD)

His motive is unclear at this point
but may be a response to the recent
incident at the Baltimore human
reservation

GREER in the back seat takes in this news grimly The

CABBIE has been glancing at his own monitor in front

CABBIE
Goddamn Dreads sure you dont
wanna change your mind

GREER

EXT BALTIMORE SLUMS - DAY

Late afternoon GREER emerges from a TAXI near the same

gate we saw earlier Greer wobbles steadies himself
against the car as he pays the CABBIE-- a DRONE
SURROGATE built into the seat

CABBIE

GREER
Just a little carsick
The TAXI pulls away Greer heads for the GATE

EXT RESERVATION NO MANS LAND - DAY

the many IMAGES OF THE PROPHET to be found in the rez

GREER
Where would I find the the what do

DREAD GUARD
Ten blocks that way left on
Bloomfield

GREER

(eyes the grim area)
Catch a lotta surries tryin to

DREAD GUARD

As Greer crosses the rubble-strewn no mans land he
pauses sickened as he sees--

--the burned-out HELICOPTER HULK now sprayed with
GRAFITTI PIGS DIE etc And just beyond this--
--whats left of GREERS SURRIE half the head blown off
with fried electronics hanging out Its been lashed to
a makeshift crucifix made from the bent CHOPPER BLADES
The clothing is shredded the remains spray-painted
GREER wary of being recognized continues on

EXT RESERVATION STREET - DAY

GREER walks through a poor but surprisingly pleasant
neighborhood-- rowhouses gardens Very few cars

DREADS look like ordinary working-class folks

A BARBECUE a group of RESIDENTS laughing and drinking
Greer inhales the SMOKE as he passes smiles to himself
A couple of FRIENDLY DOGS trot curiously after him fora
moment then return to the barbecue GREER not paying
attention brushes past an ELDERLY MALE PEDESTRIAN

GREER
Excuse me
PEDESTRIAN
(smiles and nods)
No problem
A PLAYGROUND a short distance onLOTS OF KIDS shrieking
and running Greer pauses here taking this in These
are the first children weve seen outside of a TV ad
A CLOUD OF DIESEL SMOKE from a decrepit BUS Greer
CHOKES on this but doesnt seem displeased His body
language has become more relaxed as he gets further into
the rez getting his land legs back

INT RESERVATION TEMPLE - DAY

A cavernous convention center thousands of folding
chairs face a raised PULPIT at one end Behind this is a
SUPERGRAPHIC of the PROPHET hands raised in benediction

GREER enters takes this in He spots a CLEANING LADY
an older woman sweeping up amidst the rows nearby

GREER
Excuse me You wouldnt happen to
know a Jack Strickland Im told
he worked here off and on

CLEANING LADY

(NODS)
Youre here for the service Its
in the park

EXT RESERVATION PARK - DUSK

GREER moves down a path in this expanse of greenery He
comes to an open lawn with a fairly large CROWD gathered
illuminated by a FLAMING TORCH

THE PROPHET is speaking He stands before a platform
atop wooden scaffolding firewood piled below A
formidable ring of BODYGUARDS stands between him and the
gathered throng of DREADS

PROPHET
--serving faithfully beside us in
the cause of humanity I had the
privilege of hearing his confession
shortly before his death
GREER has pushed his way gently toward the front to get a
look at the BODY atop the funeral BIER
The corpse atop the bier is that of JACK STRICKLAND eyes
closed hands folded

PROPHET (CONTD)
And I know he would have rejoiced
in the day of resurrection the
day for which we are all
preparing the day I promise you
is close at hand
So saying the PROPHET lifts the torch and touches it to
the base of the PYRE which ERUPTS IN FLAME
CLOSE ON STRICKLAND as the FLAMES lick up around him
LATER the BIER consumed in FIRE the MOURNERS
dispersing THE PROPHET is moving away HANDLERS
surrounding him GREER tags along-- but one of the
Prophets goons BUD gets in his face

BUD
Who are you

GREER
What happened to Jack Strickland

BUD
He slipped and fell Friend of yours
Greer starts to move around him Bud gets in his way

GREER
Id like a word with the Prophet

BUD
You and everyone else
MILLER and ADAMS another goon now join them

GREER
Strickland was carrying a weapon
If it isnt recovered there could
be serious consequences-- for all
of you
IN BG the PROPHET and HANDLERS head toward a large RV

MILLER
You some kinda cop Wheres your
puppet

GREER
Needs repairs

MILLER

You armed
GREER shakes his head raises his hands

GREER
Frisk me if you want

MILLER
No thats OK
With that he throws a SUCKER PUNCH to the gut GREER
doubles over He seems amazed at the sensation the
pain But he recovers throws a wild punch at Miller and
misses by a foot Violence for Greer in human form
should have a very different painfully visceral feel
unlike when he was a surrogate

ADAMS cracks Greer across the back of his head GREER
falls to the ground BUD kicks him once GREER chokes
and groans in pain
MILLER (CONTD)
Hurts doesnt it

BUD
Its a bitch being real
GREER lets out a primal CRY and lunges at MILLER driving
his head into the mans torso knocking the wind out of
him before the other two can pull Greer back

ADAMS
I think he likes it

MILLER
(catching his breath)
So give him some more
Outnumbered three to one Greer takes a beating
continues to throw mostly ineffective punches that just
cause the men to redouble their efforts Finally hes
limp in their arms
Miller plucks Greers WALLET and BADGE from his pockets
examines them As he does so GREER spits BLOOD on the
mans face Miller seems about to whomp him again but
stops himself

MILLER (CONTD)
Not gonna give you the
satisfaction
(to Bud and Adams)
Get him out of here
Miller tosses Greers ID at him then moves toward the
RV leaving GREER gasping in the clutches of Bud and
Adams lit by the FLAMES from the funeral pyre

INT PROPHETS RV - NIGHT

A spartan interior MILLER enters THE PROPHET stands
with a couple of HANDLERS

HANDLER
Trouble

MILLER
Some fed named Greer he wanted to
talk to the Prophet

HANDLER
About that turkey shoot in DC

MILLER
Didnt come up Said they wanted
Stricklands weapon

PROPHET
Well maybe Ill just have to
bring it to their doorstep
In the Prophets hand we now see--
--the mysterious DEVICE with which Strickland killed his
targets

EXT RESERVATION NO MANS LAND - NIGHT

GREER is half-dragged half-carried back the way he
came flanked by BUD and ADAMS Greer sucks on his
BLEEDING lip works his tongue around in his mouth He
touches parts of his bruised body carefully

BUD
Guy like you oughtnt be out in
just your skin

GREER
Im starting to see your point
AT THE GATE - GREER leaves trying to muster as much
dignity as he can The DREAD GUARD calls sarcastically
after him

DREAD GUARD
Come again real soon

EXT BALTIMORE SLUMS - NIGHT

GREER trudges along the seedy streets He looks a mess--
torn clothing bloodstains bruises Suddenly hes
SHOVED from behind falls to the pavement

WHEELS
Oops
The assailant is a FREAK SURRIE-- extra ARMS WHEELS
where his feet should be
A moment later Greer is surrounded by three rich FREAKY
TEENS

Theyve customized their surries in completely bizarre
ways in addition to the usual tattoos and piercings
Besides WHEELS theres a hairless teen with six EYES
scattered around his head A GIRL has SPIKES sticking
out of her skull and flesh and REPTILE SKIN

EYES
Watch where youre going meat

SPIKES
What are you doin off the rez
She bumps against GREER as he picks himself up he
shrinks from the spikes She shoots a small blast of
FLAME from her nostrils then GIGGLES

GREER
Im not a Dread

WHEELS
Then you oughta return that
surrie looks like shit
WHEELS comes at Greer again Greer moves and TRIPS him--
but he just lands on an extra arm and rights himself

EYES
Hey it wants to play
EYES lowers his head and moves to butt him GREER
dodges it looks like a bullfight

SPIKES
Ole toro
They turn hearing a SCREECH OF TIRES
A LIMOUSINE has pulled up A 10-year-old BOY climbs from
the back and approaches
BOY
Agent Greer Would you like a ride
The kids voice sounds like a childs but with mature
cadences to his speech -

WHEELS
Check out Richie Rich
THE DRIVER of the Limo steps out-- its ARMANDO from
Canters lobby He lets his jacket fall open revealing
a HOLSTERED SIDEARM

ARMANDO
We got a problem here
The FREAKS retreat with dirty looks

SPIKES
Fascists
The BOY moves back toward the LIMO Greer follows

BOY
(re the freaks)
So many unforeseen consequences to
the surrogate revolution I
suppose I should apologize

GREER
Who are you

INT LIMO -- NIGHT

As GREER climbs in the BOY hands him back his own
BUSINESS CARD the one Greer left with Canter

BOYCANTER
You left this on my desk
ARMANDO has gotten behind the wheel starts moving
Greer looks at the boy amazed
GREER
Canter

BOYCANTER
Its not safe for me to use my
usual surrogates This is one of
VSIsnewer models Not that the
market will be that strong the
birthrate being what it is

GREER
Youre having me followed

BOYCANTER
You know how important this
investigation is to me

GREER

(A BEAT)
The man who killed your son is dead
BoyCanter absorbs this

BOYCANTER
I want you to tell me everything

GREER
I suppose you deserve that

EXT WASHINGTON DC - NIGHT

THE LIMO drives along the Potomac near the city
INT LIMO - NIGHT

GREER holds ICE to his swollen face

BOYCANTER
This Strickland character I
dont believe he could have been
acting on his own

GREER
Why not You stand for everything
the humanists hate--

BOYCANTER
Then why would his own people
murder-him

GREER
Hed outlived his usefulness
With me all over his ass he was
becoming a security risk--

BOYCANTER
To kill someone remotely-- it
would take a virus presumably one
that could get past every firewall
protecting a surries circuitry--
then once in the CPU override all
the fail-safes and cause
catastrophic brain damage

GREER
Presumably

BOYCANTER
Were talking about an

EXTRAORDINARILY SOPHISTICATED
technology dont you think The
Dreads didnt come up with it -
they dont even like to use
cellphones

GREER

(EXASPERATED)
OK fine Maybe weve got our
heads up our own ass--

BOYCANTER
Maybe thats exactly where you
should be looking
Greer takes a second to absorb this

GREER
So now youre the victim of a
government conspiracy

BOYCANTER
I think this is your stop

EXT GREERS BUILDING - NIGHT

THE LIMO stops a light RAIN now falling GREER gets out
and closes the door the rear window rolls down

BOYCANTER
Somebody hired Strickland Youll
know who that is when you trace
the weapon

GREER
You really dont need to do my job
for me
BoyCanter takes in Greers disheveled state

BOYCANTER
Yes I can see youve got things
under control
The limo pulls away Greer pauses looks up at the sky
letting the rain wash over his face

INT GREERS APARTMENTLIVING ROOM - NIGHT

AN ELECTRICAL ARC jumps from a GLASS TUBE to a MALE
NOSTRIL

WIDER the guy taking the jolt is a lanky male model
named BRIAN His face goes slack ATMOSPHERIC MUSIC

PLAYS

MAGGIE and BRIDGET are squeezed together on the couch in
Greers apartment with BRIAN and a French hunk named
ANDRE who speaks with a slight ACCENT Everyone is
pretty high Andre closes one eye then the other
pupils turned inward

ANDRE
Think my nose is too big

MAGGIE
For what

ANDRE

(SQUEEZING IT)
Im going to have it replaced

BRIDGET
While youre at it-- I am so sick
of twelve-inch dicks
MAGGIE chuckles On the coffee table before them sits a
small JACKER like the one we saw in the underground
club The foursome pass a single ELECTRICAL TUBE around
attached by a cord to the device Andre and Bridget have
clearly coupled up Brian touches Maggies leg casually
from time to time

ANDRE
What do you want were men

BRIAN
(coming out of it)
Why is that Why do we all have
to be men and women Id rather
be-- I dunno a lion Or an
eagle

MAGGIE
Mm A spaceship Or a cloud

BRIAN
(BEAT)
A cloud
Maggie shrugs She lifts the hair from the nape of her
neck moves the GLASS TUBE there Brian holds her close
The ELECTRICAL ARC-- MAGGIE gasps with pleasure
transported
A moment later Andre notices that GREER has entered
quietly during the above staring at the foursome

ANDRE
Dont look now Some homeless
meatbag just wandered in
Maggie has blanked out for the moment Bridget turns

BRIDGET
Thats Maggies husband Hi Tom
She gives him a little wave Greer moves past them
toward the kitchen and disappears Maggie comes out of
her trance blinks and sighs

MAGGIE
Excuse me
She hurries after him Brian shrugs grabs the tube and
starts to unzip his pants--

INT GREERS APARTMENTKITCHEN - NIGHT

GREER has removed an old yellowed FIRST-AID KIT from
under the sink during the scene he cleans up cuts opens
his shirt to check his bruised ribs etc

MAGGIE
What happened to you I thought
you were-spending another night in
the hospital

GREER
Obviously You know I dont like
you jacking in the house
He finds an untouched dusty bottle of SCOTCH sniffs it
and pours a drink Maggie looks him over

MAGGIE
Somebody beat you up How could
you go out like that
As Maggie speaks she moves to his side touching his
injuries gently truly concerned Greer flinches back

MAGGIE (CONTD)
What were you thinking Tom You
couldve been killed

GREER
Just finding out how the other
half lives

Greer takes a long drink gestures toward the living
room

GREER (CONTD)
So whats his name

MAGGIE
Oh please grow up

GREER

(NODS GLUMLY)
I suppose it doesnt matter Since
as you keep telling me it doesnt
mean anything Nothing does
Greer pours another drink

MAGGIE
I dont expect you to understand
this But once in a while I like
to be around people who dont hate
being alive

GREER
Alive Is that what they are out
there
She shakes her head and returns to the living room

INT GREERS APARTMENTLIVING ROOM - NIGHT

MAGGIE BRIDGET BRIAN and ANDRE are still partying-- in
fact Bridget and Andre are starting to make out-- when
GREER re-enters in a RAINCOAT hes a little tipsy The
BOTTLE pokes out of a pocket

BRIAN
Hey You really a G-man
Greer pauses stares at the man

BRIAN (CONTD)
Can I ask you something Is it
true you guys are tapping into our
surries Watching everything we
do twenty-four seven

GREER

(A BEAT)
Of course not

Greer starts to move across the room again heading for
the door Brian smirks speaks quietly thinking only
the others will hear As he touches Maggies leg

BRIAN
Wouldnt want him spying on us
tonight
Greer spins near the door and without breaking stride
returns to the couch
GREER
Excuse me
Brian turns starts to rise Greer grabs the man and
HURLS him backwards onto the GLASS COFFEE TABLE which
SHATTERS The other three back away After a stunned
moment Brian starts LAUGHING very hard-- obviously he
hasnt felt a thing

MAGGIE
Tom the table
Greer steps over the couch calmly and begins PUNCHING and
KICKING the surrie on the floor working off pent-up
rage BRIAN just keeps LAUGHING
Soon Greers hands are cut and bleeding hes panting
exhausted MAGGIE finally succeeds in pulling him away-
BRIAN sits up his FACE is DENTED the plastic skin
STRETCHED and TORN

BRIAN
Could we do it again

ANDRE

(CHUCKLING)
Oh man your face

BRIAN
I was getting sick of it anyway
As Brian picks bits of GLASS out of his plastic flesh
Andre suddenly realizes his JACKER is SMASHED examines
the pieces with a MOAN

GREER

Guess the partys over

MAGGIE follows GREER to the door They speak in hushed
TONES

MAGGIE
What was the point of that

GREER
Does everything have to have a
point
GREER takes a breath bows his head

GREER (CONTD)
Im sorry I just want us to-- to

holds up a hand and lets it fall

GREER (CONTD)
This has become obsolete Someday

people are going to come to their
senses eventually

She gestures to the boxes of documents

PETERS (CONTD)
The case files were removed but
there was a paper trail from

informant

GREER

(PERKING UP)
For us Who was running him

PETERS
Wasnt in the paperwork But he
mustve been selling intel on the

Its from my memory Damn thing
put me in the hospital

Wish I could help

GREER
Killed a couple of cops as well
We believe this weapon-- the one
that doesnt exist-- is in the

Brandon is finally losing his composure

BRANDON
If this is true were going to

have to do everything in our-power
to recover it Do you have any
idea how serious this is

GREER
I was hoping youd tell me
BRANDON looks conflicted finally opens up

BRANDON
This is absolutely off the record
(off Greers nod)
Its called an Overload Device or
OD Theyre brand new only a
handful exist But I checked ran
every serial number-- all accounted
for

GREER
Not this one Maybe it never got
to you guys in the first place
Who makes them

BRANDON
Its a DARPA design subcontracted to
Pierson Defense The idea was to
create a non-lethal weapon that could
disable every surrie in the field
You beam a software virus straight to
the CPU The fail-safes kick in and
the operators are cut off Circuits
all melt down in seconds youre left
with a field full of scrap

GREER
You win the battle with one shot
(BEAT)
Let me guess You found a way
around the fail-safes

BRANDON

(GRIM NOD)
Just a few lines of code the
connection stays open We tried it on
soldier volunteers once The virus
caused every neuron to fire at the
same time Melted their brains
