low wall and sits down clutching his stomach

STUART was in his early twenties when he died He has a
slightly rotten appearance and continually dribbles with
ectoplasmic slime We can see through him although the
degree of translucence is not always consistent
STUART had a double degree in art history and theology

CYRUS is the other apparition He is a black dude from
the seventies White disco suit built up heels and
sideburns

He is confronted with the sight of the JUDGE a tall
elderly Emanation - a lawman from the last days of the
nineteenth century The JUDGE was embalmed but it was a
cheap job and hasn’t stood the test of time His dry
mummified body is in an advanced state of decay He
looks even worse without his jaw bone

The JUDGE is swivelling around blazing away wildly with
two rusty ghost Colts FRANK flinches as ghost bullets
pass through his body and the wall behind without leaving

a mark CYRUS and STUART peer warily out of framed
paintings

bullet ricochets past STUART’S ear taking a nick out of
it Ectoplasm dribbles between his fingers

STUART
For Godsake Frank I could’ve
me been killed

FRANK takes a flying leap at RUSTLER bringing him down
in a tackle He tugs the ghostly jaw bone out of the
DOG’S mouth

FRANK
Put your shooters away Judge

rams it back into his face

The moat elaborate method of
Mummification was inevitably the
most expensive The liquefied
brain was drawn out through the
nose with a hooked iron An
incision was made in the side of
the abdomen and viscera were
removed except for the heart
which was believed to be the seat
of the emotions and intellect

crowd He pauses looks down and discovers he has
just stood on a curious little pile of business cards
Frank Bannister’s name is clearly visible

the nearest litter bin he is just about to throw then

in when he suddenly hesitates

A dry shriveled unwrapped mummy is on display in a glass
case next to the litter bin The CURATOR stares in
horror as the mummy’s head slowly turns towards him

A bead of sweat rolls down the CURATOR’S forehead the
pummy’s thin desiccated lips tighten into a ghoulish
grin

The CURATOR looks fearfully at Prank’s card again stuffs
one in his pocket and quickly discards the others before
hurrying off to rejoin the CROWD who have now moved a

--- This Death figure is nothing
more than a homicidal alter-ego
who satisfies your compulsion to
kill Every time you decide to
take somebody out a fictional
Death figure suddenly appears and
does the job for you It’s your
rational minds way of absolving
yourself of guilt How else could
you deal with killing your wife
