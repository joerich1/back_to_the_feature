FIRST LADY LAURA CRIGHTON The Belle of her Kentucky Family
the sweetheart of the American people since her birth to
President Roland Hartford now retired and his beloved wife
and partner Kitty Hartford Laura has always been at home in
Washington and on the world stage

Paradoxically this has given her the kind of intimate
relationship with the public that say Diana had in England
In fact she is considered the start of the New American
Royalty though she would find the phrase laughable

Laura is young for her position in her very early forties
Many men have said they were in love with her

SEATED OPPOSITE THE FIRST LADY in true CBN interview style
is BARBARA BERNHARD

A LOUD CRACK OF THUNDER makes the chandelier SHAKE Both
women look up at it
LAURA
(somewhat mischievous)

barbara
(slightly unnerved)
You dont really believe this room
is haunted do you

LAURA
Oh My Dad used to say Washington is
full of ghosts - some are even

deceased barbara bernhard

Enjoys the humor but not quite comfortable about the ghost
as the room SOUNDS WITH THUNDER and the TV DIRECTOR calls
out

A SHRUNKEN HEAD ON A STICK suddenly appears before his eyes
lit by a BOLT OF LIGHTNING from outside Peter is too scared
to scream

Its his sister WENDY thirteen the secret scourge of his
life teasing him again

to control himself)

BARBARA
--one of the questions which have
arisen is when you say you wont
sleep with your husband - and I hope
you wont misunderstand me - this
means only on a conjugal basis

LAURA
It means I am remaining celibate
until the Government releases all
information regarding the death of
the phytoplankton

BARBARA
But according to Thermal Paper 486
isnt it already too late

LAURA
We still have hope -- someone said
that all human wisdom was contained
in the words wait and hope

BARBARA
Isnt that a gloomy prospect if the
end is already in sight
LAURA
Were all going to die but we still
make other plans --

BARBARA
Do you regard your husband the
President as the villain in this
regard

LAURA
Hes as caught up in the game as the
others

BARBARA
What others

LAURA
The oil industry the auto industry
the road builders and the investors
and advertisers and consumers --

BARBARA
That includes just about every human
being then doesnt it

LAURA
Oh yes and me too

BARBARA
Then what can your celibacy possibly
accomplish

LAURA
We can put brakes on We can put the
brakes on unscrupulous oil shippers -
oil shipping is the worlds largest
business - with an average of ten
thousand oil spills a day when our
water is destroyed by one drop of
oil per million -- and we can
encourage auto makers to employ
alternate technology and farmers to
stop using oil based pesticides --

BARBARA
These businesses dont just involve
men

LAURA
Face it Men control those industries
And the desire of men for women is
fundamental to the male idea of
conquest and property If we take
the women from men well see change
a lot quicker

BARBARA
Youre asking women to use sex as
power

LAURA

Is that new

BARBARA
Well its way out of fashion
politically you must know

LAURA
Every new child is a kind of
ecological system which must be fed
nurtured taught and in some sense
controlled for upwards of eighty
years now Yet the planet is losing
its ability to sustain these lives

BARBARA
So you are advising women to stop
making love

LAURA

Love No I am not advocating the
end of love I am proposing the short
term use of female allure to achieve
a brand new goal a new kind of life

on earth

REUTER HEMMINGS
From Big Oil to Big Auto to the
Military the President got an earful
about his wifes actions today and
most of it was not what he wanted to
hear since the First Lady has managed
to offend just about every major
political and religious group in
these United States

MORE SCENES OF president crighton in the oval office greets

our top military who resent
allegations that ships at sea are
major polluters and that Army bases
have destroyed tens of thousands of
acres

PRESIDENT CRIGHTON

(reads )
-Our happiness is not an ordinary
matter of young lovers it is for
me a matter of efficiency I am
absolutely dependent on intimate
love for the right and free and most
effective use of my power and I
know by experience what it costs my
work to do without it If during
this dreadful week that has just
gone by the most anxious week of my
whole term as President when
loneliness sat upon me like a pall -
I could have you actually at my side
I would have laughed at the strain
and carried it with a light heart
Love personal love is the one thing
a mans heart cannot do without

CYRUS AND BRETT Stare at their boss moved

CYRUS
Are you sending that to Laura

PRESIDENT CRIGHTON
Its already been sent By Woodrow
Wilson to Edith Bolling Galt - almost

stream stomps his hoof as if in approval and almost
joyously

CEASAR SCREAMS

FREEZE FRAME

THE END
