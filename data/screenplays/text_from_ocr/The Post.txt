INT DINING ROOM DUPONT CLUB - MORNING

It’s breakfast there’s a soft hum of conversation The glass
windows on one side show off the DC skyline BEN BRADLEE
(late 40s articulate but short-tempered) sits with his back
against the view He has a red pencil in hand and reads the
draft of a story “Senate Told Nixon Aid to Laos Illegal”

Chryon June 9 1971

Bradlee rubs his eyes and looks around the room There are
MEN scattered amongst the tables reading newspapers Bradlee
squints to get a better look - every paper is “The New York
Times” He frowns and looks back at the story - bored

KAY (0S)
Am I late

KATHARINE “KAY” GRAHAM (mid 50s) speaks with trained intent -
never letting something slip that she hasn’t considered many
times over She’s well put together but not ostentatious

BRADLEE
(surprised)
Mrs Graham

KAY
I thought we said 830

BRADLEE
Yes I was just catching up ona
few things

She nods once and sits A WAITER arrives

WAITER
(to Kay)
May I get you anything

KAY
A cup of tea please

WAITER
Mr Bradlee

BRADLEE
Thanks but another cup and I’1l1 be
flying to the office

Neither Kay nor the waiter get it The waiter leaves
KAY

Is there something you wanted to
talk about

He reaches into his bag and pulls out a magazine folded toa
certain page and shows it to her

BRADLEE
Have you seen this

KAY
Of course

She doesn’t take it as he intended so now it hangs limply
between them He reads -

BRADLEE
“Men are more able than women at
executive work and in certain
situations I think a man would be
better at this job I’m in thana
woman” Did you say that

KAY

It’s an interview with me
BRADLEE

But do you believe it
KAY

Do you not
BRADLEE

(annoyed )

It doesn’t particularly matter what
I believe - I’m not the Publisher
of the Washington Post

She gives a noncommittal acknowledgment A moment passes

BRADLEE (CONT’D)
Well I’m in a tough position with
it

KAY
Why is that

BRADLEE
How am I supposed to put a paper
together with someone who doesn’t
think they should be in charge

KAY
I didn’t say that

BRADLEE
It was implied
KAY
Forgive me but I disagree

BRADLEE
Forgive me but that doesn’t
particularly matter I’m pretty
sure the consensus is in my corner

KAY
There are corners

BRADLEE
(sighs)
That’s not what I meant

KAY
Playground fights aren’t going to
get us anywhere Mr Bradlee

BRADLEE
That’s why we’re in a restaurant
not a sandbox

She presses her lips together - a nervous tic she’s never
been able to shake Maybe to stop her from saying something
she shouldn’t

BRADLEE (CONT’D)
We’ve been getting mail - letters -

from women Asking you to correct
your quote

She’s taken aback but covers

KAY
That’s ridiculous

BRADLEE
I’m not so sure that it is

KAY
Well that won’t be happening

He sighs a moment passes

BRADLEE
I’m not trying to be combative
I we’re still new at this

She gives him a look
BRADLEE (CONTD)
The two of us Working together As
editor and look I don’t seea
point in letting things fester

KAY
I agree

BRADLEE
Good I -

KAY

I’d like you to tell me what you’re
doing with the Style section

The term “style” comes out as if it has vinegar attached to
it He crosses his arms and sits back in the chair - annoyed

BRADLEE
In what way

KAY
Is there more than one

BRADLEE
We’re figuring it out

KAY
It’s been a year

BRADLEE
It’s going to take another

KAY
We can not keep wasting time on a
section that discusses what is
it again

BRADLEE

Fashion lifestyle you know -
She doesn’t

BRADLEE (CONT’D)
My wife likes it

KAY
I’m happy for her

BRADLEE
We can’t drop the “Style” section

KAY
Why not
BRADLEE
Because The Times is starting to
print their own

KAY
Good for them

BRADLEE
If they run with it and it’s a hit
how’s that going to look

She purses her lips again he’s exasperated She pulls a
piece of paper from her purse

KAY
I’ve got a quote here too
(she reluctantly reads)
“Ben Bradlee needs a managing
editor like a boar needs tits”

He lets out a laugh a man nearby gives her a look

KAY (CONT’D)
You know who sent this to me

BRADLEE
How many guesses do I get

KAY
Gene Patterson

BRADLEE
Would’ve needed three

KAY
Hell be stepping down at the end
of the year

BRADLEE
What’s he waiting for

KAY
I asked him to stay

He gives her a look clearly annoyed

KAY (CONT’D)
You ask for my support I hire you
support then you terrorize them

BRADLEE
Or maybe he just wanted to see if
youd say “tits”
KAY
That’s beside the point

BRADLEE
We’re dancing around that aren’t
we
(beat)
I didn’t terrorize Gene

KAY
He’s your managing editor

BRADLEE
Was

KAY
He said you’re not receptive to his
ideas

BRADLEE
That’s not how I’d put it

KAY
How am I supposed to trust The Post
is doing what it should if you
change your mind at every turn

BRADLEE
I’m not changing my mind about
Style

KAY
You changed your mind about Gene

BRADLEE
No I never wanted Gene I was
clear about that

KAY
(exasperated)
I’m trying to work with you Mr
Bradlee

BRADLEE
No Mrs Graham you’re not Gene’s
right - I don’t need a managing
editor I need a publisher you
who is willing to back me my
editors and my writers

KAY
How do I not
BRADLEE
(shaking the magazine)
By saying idiotic things like this

The people around them sneak a peek once more This isn’t the
first time Kay’s been scolded but probably the only time
it’s happened from outside her family Bradlee knows he went
too far but he’s too stubborn to apologize

KAY
Forgive me but I don’t know what
you want me to Say

BRADLEE
In the event of that just say
nothing

They sit quietly The waiter arrives with her tea

WAITER
Ready to order

This is going to be a long breakfast

BEGIN OPENING CREDITS

EXT DUPONT CLUB - A LITTLE LATER

Bradlee steps onto the street the bustle of pedestrians and
commuters on their way to work He begins his journey through
the maze of DC

INT UNDERGROUND GARAGE DUPONT CLUB - SAME TIME

Kay climbs into the back of a chauffeured car Simply this
is something she’s always done

INT CAR - CONTINUOUS

The car pulls out into the city and heads in the direction of
The Post offices Sitting on the seat next to Kay is the
magazine It’s her own copy She’s on the cover - regal but
sad The title “One-on-One with the Queen of the Beltway”
She frowns

EXT VARIOUS WASHINGTON DC - SAME TIME
Bradlee edges his way around a small Vietnam protest walking

towards the White House which can be seen off in the
distance
INT CAR - SAME TIME

Kay reads the article It’s clear she’s read it many times
and is perhaps more insecure about what she said than she let
on The car pulls into another underground garage and stops

INT LOBBY WASHINGTON POST - SAME TIME

Bradlee walks in his shirt damp from the humidity and walk
He throws his copy of the magazine into a nearby trash can
and climbs onto an elevator

INT EXECUTIVE FLOOR WASHINGTON POST - SAME TIME

The elevator doors open Kay’s posture straightens jaw
tightens she steps off The energy is tense stiff quiet
Along the wall are two portraits EUGENE MEYER (1875-1959)
Kay’s father and PHIL GRAHAM (1915-1963) Kay’s late
husband They watch over her as she passes to her office at
the end of the hall

END OPENING CREDITS

INT BULLPEN WASHINGTON POST - MORNING

Bradlee steps off a different elevator and looks across the
bullpen a constant soundtrack of typewriters the din of the
news on a TV set random conversations that come in spurts
and starts He smiles to himself - this is home The serenity
lasts for just one moment when -

MEG
I want to ask them about the vets
again

MEG GREENFIELD (40s no-nonsense) instantly annoys him He
doesn’t stop walking

BRADLEE
No

MEG
They’re throwing their medals into
the Potomac and we’re OK with the
White House’s “no comment”

BRADLEE
I need you to write something about
the protest
MEG
Which one

BRADLEE
The United-Women’s-whatever-they’ re-
called Go and I don’t know
Just get them to not hate us right
now

MEG
I take it Mrs Graham won’t be
retracting -

BRADLEE
Go away

She grins and heads off as Bradlee approaches his office
handing his briefcase to his secretary CYNTHIA BEN
BAGDIKIAN (50s Turkish resolute) is waiting for him

BRADLEE (CONTD)
(to Cynthia annoyed)
I thought you told them not to
hover

CYNTHIA
They don’t listen

BRADLEE
This is going to annoy me isn’t
it

BAGDIKIAN

Have you seen Sheehan around

BRADLEE
Neil Have we started letting the
Times just take up office space

here
BAGDIKIAN
He hasn’t been at the briefings in
a while
BRADLEE
What’s a while
BAGDIKIAN
Weeks
BRADLEE

(surprised)
Weeks

BAGDIKIAN
Yea

BRADLEE
No I haven’t seen him

BAGDIKIAN
OK

Bagdikian walks off abruptly as he customarily does
Something about this sticks in Bradlee’s craw

BRADLEE
(annoyed )
Get someone to find out what
Sheehan’s been up to

Cynthia nods He heads off down the hallway

INT GENE’S OFFICE WASHINGTON POST - MOMENTS LATER

GENE PATTERSON (late 40s thinning hairline) reads over some
pages There’s a knock on the door Bradlee stands there
Gene sighs and sits back in his chair Bradlee enters

BRADLEE
Did you do it so she’d say tit

GENE
Just an added bonus

Beat

BRADLEE
I can’t say that I’m all that
disappointed

GENE
Nothing but honest

BRADLEE
It’s not like either of us get
anything out of the other being
miserable

GENE
You’re right on that

BRADLEE
Are you miserable

GENE
It’s been difficult
BRADLEE
I’m the “it” in that sentence

GENE
Yes

Bradlee thinks about that and nods
BRADLEE
Mrs Graham said you’1l be staying

on for a couple of months

GENE
She asked me to

BRADLEE
If you don’t want to I’ll -

GENE
No I’d like to see things get
sorted properly
Bradlee nods and extends his hand across the desk
BRADLEE
A shame it didn’t work out - I hope
you know I respect you
Gene rises and accepts the handshake
GENE
I didn’t so thank you
INT BOARDROOM WASHINGTON POST - SAME TIME

TEN MEN sit around a large oval table At the head is

FREDERICK “FRITZ” BEEBE (late 60s Chairman of the Board
proper and kind) with PAUL IGNATIUS (50s President of the

Washington Post Co stuck up) to his right

On his left is Kay - she’s tense in this setting Her
rest properly on a bound document in front of her It
“THE WASHINGTON POST COMPANY INITIAL IPO PROSPECTUS”

FRITZ
As you can see our underwriters
have proposed an IPO for a little
over 135 Million shares of Class B
stock All of the Class A stock
will stay within the Meyer-Graham
family and they will continue to
have the majority vote and right to
elect 70 percent of the directors

(MORE )

hands
reads

FRITZ (CONTD)
Class B stockholders will elect the
remainder

There are some murmurs of acknowledgment a few nods

IGNATIUS
Well I think that’s where my
problem is Fritz

Fritz sighs he and Ignatius clearly aren’t compatible Kay’s
face tightens

FRITZ
How so

IGNATIUS
The majority vote to elect the
majority of directors That
feels one sided to say the
least

FRITZ
Do you have another suggestion

IGNATIUS
I just think that perhaps there
should be more of a balance As
President it seems like my voice
should be heard no

The tenor of the room becomes tense Ignatius keeps a
watchful eye on Kay MARVIN (60s) a boardmember

MARVIN
I see where he’s coming from
Fritz We were elected to the board

in order -
FRITZ
You were elected by the Graham
family
MARVIN
Well I -

Marvin shifts in his seat uncomfortable eyeing Kay

KAY
It’s alright Marvin Go on

MARVIN
Respectfully Mrs Graham I was
elected to this seat by your
father

(MORE)

MARVIN (CONTD)
And - I - well I feela
responsibility to keep the company
going in the direction he had hoped

for

KAY
And you feel that I’m not doing
that

BOARDMEMBER 2
It’s not that necessarily -

Kay is surprised by the second opinion

BOARDMEMBER 2 (CONT’D)
It’s just Well Your appointment
happened by unfortunate
circumstances Because of your
husband’s well because of Phil’s
accident And there’s a standard
that The Post - there’s a standard
we’re used to meeting

Kay purses her lips Ignatius clears his throat -

IGNATIUS
It’s about the numbers Mrs
Graham The revenue from the Post
is down by 1 so far this quarter

FRITZ
It’s only June

IGNATIUS
And there have been quite a lot of
attacks against the President

KAY
Not just by us

MARVIN
I understand the President even
cancelled his subscription to the
Post

FRITZ
That was years ago

IGNATIUS
(exasperated)
You called him Caligula for
Christ’s sake

I did

IGNATIUS
Your editor

KAY
That’s not me

IGNATIUS
Maybe that’s the problem

KAY
(indignant)
That I’m not the editor

IGNATIUS
That you don’t have control of him

KAY
(heated)
What does this have to do with our
stock offer

IGNATIUS
It’s more so with the suggested
reorganization -

KAY
This company has been owned and
operated by my family for 40 years

IGNATIUS
Perhaps that’s what needs to
change

Kay is stunned as are a number of people in the room
Ignatius keeps his eyes on hers

INT KAY’S OFFICE WASHINGTON POST - A LITTLE LATER

Kay slams the proposal onto her desk furious Her office is
tasteful mid-century modern with personal touches
throughout photos of her children etc Fritz walks in and
closes the door behind him

KAY
Phil always hated them

FRITZ
That was a long list

KAY
You seem very relaxed about all of
this

FRITZ

I don’t know if relaxed is the term
I’d use but yes I think you’re
preoccupied with the negative

KAY
Is there something I’m missing

FRITZ
(calm)
The IPO has been approved With
your shares the estate’s shares
it’s a good day

KAY
I hate money

FRITZ
That’s because you’ve always had
it
She gives him a sharp look but he’s not wrong
FRITZ (CONTD)
This is what the paper needs to

keep going You know that

She nods Her face softens the mask of confidence beginning
to drip away A moment passes

KAY
None of them came to my defense

FRITZ
That’s not their style

Beat
KAY
Do you think I’m letting them run

wild

FRITZ
Downstairs

She nods he shrugs
FRITZ (CONT’D)

I never got involved in Post
business Phil hated it
KAY
It just seemed easier for him
He could talk to them

FRITZ
Well Phil He loved having the
ink stains and all that Fighting
it out Your father Eugene liked
to be a part but not a player

KAY
Which worked best

FRITZ

There were issues with both - the
public thought Phil was too
involved Even you’ve said that
Maybe your father not enough But
both of them understood the
difficulties of the post You have
to be able to command the board and
the bullpen

(laughing)
And neither had to fend with Ben
Bradlee in charge

KAY
I thought they would respond to
him

FRITZ
Who

KAY
The staff The public

FRITZ
I think they do Do you

She’s not sure Kay’s secretary LIZ HYLTON (30s)
Fritz rises to leave

Kay nods

LIZ
Excuse me
FRITZ
Did they really call Nixon

Caligula

He shakes his head waving as he leaves

enters

LIZ
Your daughter called and said
she’1l meet you at the symphony
tonight

KAY
Thank you Liz

LIZ
And Mr McNamara called

Kay gives her a look

INT CONFERENCE ROOM WASHINGTON POST - SAME TIME

It’s a very different looking room than where the Board
meets Bradlee is alone and sits with his feet up on the
table reading through some reports HOWARD SIMONS (early
40s stubborn Bradlee’s right-hand man) comes in

BRADLEE
Are these meetings attendance
optional now

HOWARD
They’re scrambling

Howard sits next to Bradlee eyeing him After a moment

HOWARD (CONTD)
How’d that go

BRADLEE
What

HOWARD
With Gene

BRADLEE

It’s Friday Howard let’s wait
until the blood dries before
getting into it

HOWARD
You’re going to talk to me though
right

BRADLEE

I’m not sure if no one else shows
up in the next five minutes you all
might be fired anyway
HOWARD
Phil’s going to come in here and
tell you we don’t have anyone
covering Tricia Nixon’s wedding

BRADLEE
My heart breaks - which Phil

HOWARD
Geyelin How many Phils we got

BRADLEE
Why don’t we have anyone covering
the wedding

HOWARD
The White House won’t let us

Bradlee stares at him

BRADLEE
I’m sorry

HOWARD
Ziegler called and said Haldeman
and Nixon didn’t appreciate the
coverage from the last event so
they’re revoking our press
privileges for this one

BRADLEE

Who was supposed to be there
HOWARD

Judy
BRADLEE

Devastated I’m sure

HOWARD
She’s been calling for Ziegler all
day but he won’t return

BRADLEE
It’s only 11 am

HOWARD
So

BRADLEE

So when’d she start calling

HOWARD
You know what I mean

BRADLEE
I do and I can’t believe that the
most important conversation I’m
having with my associate editor is
whether Nixon’s daughter’s wedding
is going to make the paper this
weekend

HOWARD
What do you want -

BRADLEE
I want coverage of the goddamn
wedding

Beat

HOWARD
How was breakfast

Through the glass Bradlee can see Meg Bagdikian and a few
other EDITORS approaching

BRADLEE
Later

Howard nods

BRADLEE (CONT’D)
Well - thank you all for joining
us

MEG BAGDIKIAN
Sorry Ben Sorry

Gene enters with PHIL GEYELIN (40s balding) and TWO OTHER
EDITORS he closes the door behind them They all sit

GEYELIN
Ben we’ve got a problem with
Tricia -

BRADLEE

Someone talk to me about anything
else first Meg

GEYELIN
Ben -

MEG
The Grand Jury is issuing more
subpoenas on the Capitol bombing
HOWARD
Who are they subpoenaing

MEG
(checking notes)
A couple - white collar middle
America

BRADLEE
OK Bags anything from Paris

BAGDIKIAN
North Vietnamese said they want the
US to stop sending aid The US said
no

HOWARD
So you’d categorize that as a
productive conversation

BAGDIKIAN
(sarcastic)
Oh yes absolutely

EDITOR 1
(reading notes)

The FBI cleared it’s own funds in
congress yesterday

MEG
Are they allowed to do that

GENE
They’re the FBI

BRADLEE
(to Geyelin)
See if you can get some other
papers to share their notes and
we’ll get our story from that

EDITOR 1
(confused)
About the FBI

BRADLEE
No Why you think the FBI wants to
know what Tricia Nixon’s wearing at
her wedding

EDITOR 1
No -

HOWARD
(sotto)

Hoover does
GEYELIN

I think he means me
HOWARD

I think we should ignore it
GENE

What
HOWARD

The wedding They’re ignoring us
we might as well ignore them

GENE
I don’t know if poking the bear is
the best move right now

MEG

Would we call Nixon a bear
BAGDIKIAN

He’s more like a little eh

what do you call them
He scrunches his nose and puts his hands to his face

GEYELIN
A weasel

Bagdikian snaps his fingers and points -

MEG
Didn’t Herblock make him up like
that

HOWARD

What’re you thinking Ben

BRADLEE
I’m thinking the reason The Times
has a one up on us is because they
don’t fuck around calling Nixon a
weasel

Everyone quiets down Cynthia walks in and hands Bradlee a
note he reads

GEYELIN
I heard some Times boys going
around talking about printing
something that would “end the war”

MEG
There were one too many pronouns in
that sentence for me to care

HOWARD
They say that every other week

BAGDIKIAN
This about Sheehan

GENE
What about him

BAGDIKIAN
Nobody’s seen him in the press room
in awhile

MEG
That doesn’t mean anything that
could just be Neil being Neil

GEYELIN
You OK Ben

BRADLEE

(reading)
Mrs Graham wanted me to know that
she just received a call from the
former Secretary of Defense letting
her know that The Times will be
publishing something “damning”
about him this Sunday

GENE
What

Bradlee shows Gene the slip

MEG
(hushed to Bagdikian)
How’s she know McNamara

BAGDIKIAN
Chushed)
She and Phil Graham used to be
friends with him and his wife
before Phil -

He puts his hand to his temple as if he’s holding a gun and
pulls the trigger Meg makes a face

GEYELIN
It’s gotta be about Vietnam

GENE
Maybe about them pulling out

HOWARD
That doesn’t feel like a scoop
(to Bagdikian)
Could it be that report

BRADLEE
What report

Bagdikian rolls his eyes -

BAGDIKIAN
There was a rumor a couple years
back that some guys were hired by
the White House to do a study on
Vietnam

GEYELIN
What kind of study

HOWARD
We couldn’t even confirm that the
thing existed

BRADLEE
(to Bagdikian)
You talk to Rand

BAGDIKIAN
A couple times Nothing there

BRADLEE
(tired)
Make some calls and see if this
“study” has anything to do with -

BAGDIKIAN
It doesn’t exist Ben -

BRADLEE
Just do it I’m tired of being ten
minutes late to the party When we
meet back in a couple of hours
let’s fill in all those “someones”
and “somethings” with a few more
fucking details

He leaves Gene and Howard exchange a glance

INT HALLWAY WASHINGTON POST - MOMENTS LATER

Bradlee walks toward his office and sees MICHAEL (20s clean-
cut) waiting outside He doesn’t stop walking

BRADLEE
You the runner

MICHAEL
Yes Yes sir Michael

BRADLEE
In Let’s go

INT BRADLEE’S OFFICE WASHINGTON POST - CONTINUOUS

Michael follows behind him he hastily tucks his shirt into
his pants Bradlee gives him a look -

BRADLEE
What’re you - you tuck your shirt
in while walking into the office

MICHAEL

BRADLEE
You looked into Sheehan

MICHAEL
Yes sir

He hands Bradlee a slip of paper Bradlee looks at it

BRADLEE
What’s this

MICHAEL
Um that’s all Mr Sheehan has
written sir In the last three
months

BRADLEE
Are you sure

Michael nods Bradlee stares at the boy lost in thought
Michael shifts in his shoes uncomfortable

BRADLEE (CONT’D)
One article in three months

MICHAEL
Is that bad

BRADLEE
(sighing)
It’s not good

INT AUDITORIUM CONSTITUTION HALL - NIGHT

Beethoven’s “Symphony No 4” is played by the NATIONAL
SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA In a box Kay watches in her finest next
to her daughter LALLY (30s) The DC elite are packed in by
the thousand tuxes and studious looks on

While Kay watches the players others sneak a glance at her
the daughter matriarch widow publisher The attention
doesn’t phase Kay - she’s had it all her life She looks up
at the Presidential Box It’s empty

The Symphony finishes the quiet settles and the crowd lifts
into a roaring applause Kay snaps out of her stare and
politely claps as the Symphony takes a bow

INT O’BYRNE GALLERY CONSTITUTION HALL - LATER

Champagne glasses clink the CONDUCTOR smiles for the cameras
as he is celebrated by a few PARTYGOERS He laughs enjoying
the praise He is being watched from outside by -

EXT PORTICO CONSTITUTION HALL - CONTINUOUS

Kay She holds an untouched glass of champagne encircled by
a group of people As if they’re both protecting her and
trapping her from getting away She can’t tear her eyes from
the conductor His seeming joie de vivré

ALSOP (0OS)
Kay

She snaps out of it and looks to her friend JOE ALSOP (60s
journalist effeminate) who stares at her

KAY
Yes

ALSOP
(light)
Now it’s not just my wife but my
closest friends who ignore me

The friends around them laugh Kay quickly pulls her face
back on With them are ARCHIE PAUL Lally Lally is sociable
but doesn’t possess her mother’s innate ability to make
everyone she’s speaking to feel important

KAY
(teasing)
Joe - I could never I was just so
intoxicated by your story I lost
myself for a moment

ALSOP
This woman - always with the witty
save in her back pocket

KAY
I keep mine in my purse

Laughs abound from the group they’re smitten by her

ALSOP
I was just saying how sad it will
be to not have the Symphony perform
here anymore

LALLY
Have you seen the new pavilion
ALSOP
Only in passing It’ll have quite
the view
KAY

This one isn’t terrible

PAUL
Have you heard what they’re calling
it
ALSOP
(nodding)
Nixon can’t be happy
LALLY
Is he ever
ALSOP
(chuckling)
Touché
KAY

I was thinking about him tonight

They turn to her she surprised even herself by saying that
out loud

PAUL
Nixon

KAY
No Kennedy Phil and I - we - used
to see him in that box often I was
just thinking of how empty it’s
been since he’s been gone

ALSOP
(sotto)
Not a lot of love for the arts with
this White House

ARCHIE
I don’t know if that’s true

LALLY
I do

ALSOP
(to Lally)
Oh we miss your feistiness around
here Kay tell your daughter she
must move back here immediately

Kay smiles and forces a laugh - she’s not going to say that
It’s too personal Lally knows this she covers

LALLY
But if I come back more often the
luster will be lost and you’1l
realize I’m only my best in short
stints of time

ALSOP
That’s what they say about me

The group laughs Kay looks back to the conductor but to her
disappointment he’s moved on

EXT WARSH HOUSE GEORGETOWN - SAME TIME

In a very different part of town Bradlee rings the doorbell
of a simple home with music coming from within Standing next
to him is his wife TONY (40s beautiful but tired) His suit
is rumpled It’s tense

TONY
What’s this for
BRADLEE
(distracted)
Hm
TONY
This party -
BRADLEE

It’s for Warsh

TONY
I assumed - but what for

BRADLEE
I don’t know - he got an award or
something

TONY
You don’t know

BRADLEE
I forgot

TONY
You forgot

BRADLEE

(exasperated)
Tony it’s been a long day

He goes to ring the bell again -

TONY
Don’t They heard it

He stops Annoyed

TONY (CONTD)
Marina got a B on her History exam

BRADLEE
(absentmindedly)
That’s great

TONY
She was hoping to show you tonight

They’ve had this fight before

BRADLEE
I promised Warsh we’d be here

TONY
For a reason you’re not sure of

BRADLEE

I know the reason I just -
TONY

Forgot
BRADLEE

Can we just get through this and
save the banter for home You know
I can’t sleep without the ringing
in my ears

The door opens and CHARLOTTE MARCH (40s) answers
CHARLOTTE
(grinning)

If it isn’t my favorite duo

Bradlee forces a smile as does Tony

INT LOUNGE WARSH HOUSE - NIGHT

The room is filled with around 20 PEOPLE milling about
Bradlee heads to a corner where a BARTENDER is making drinks
and Howard is drinking them

BRADLEE
You save some for me
HOWARD
Never
(to bartender )
Two

(to Bradlee)
You stag

Bradlee gestures towards Tony speaking to another wife She
couldn’t be less interested

BRADLEE
She was in a good mood Once

Howard laughs Bradlee gets his drink then sees something at
the door

BRADLEE (CONT’D)
Nixon Cheer Squad has arrived

Howard looks as KEN (40s lanky and balding) enters with his
wife Bradlee watches unreadable

HOWARD
Who’s that
BRADLEE
Lawyer Works for the party Had
lunch with him a couple weeks back
Spent the entire time talking about
Nixon’s new “drug war”

HOWARD
When’d guys like that start keeping
the secrets

BRADLEE
It’s always guys like that Some of
them just dress better than others

EXT PORTICO CONSTITUTION HALL - LATER

Kay’s thoughts are elsewhere but she plays the part

LALLY
But they haven’t invited any women
ARCHIE
So the women have decided to
boycott
KAY

That seems extreme

LALLY
Does it

Kay glances at her contradictory daughter

PAUL
What’s that

ARCHIE
The Gridiron’s White Tie

ALSOP
What’s so wrong with inviting the
women in

KAY
Darling they’re terrified well
spill all of your secrets

Archie and Paul laugh
LALLY

If they invited you - you would go
wouldn’t you

Kay is taken aback by the question

KAY

(icy)
I’m not sure I’d look very good in
a tuxedo

Charming but cutting Lally is disappointed by the answer

ALSOP
Let’s try it at least

PAUL
What would your father say

Kay’s eyes shoot to Paul the tension is immediate

KAY
Excuse me

PAUL
Your father - what would he say if
women were allowed

Kay watches him for a moment her stare impenetrable

KAY
I certainly didn’t speak for him
when he was alive so I don’t see a
point in breaking the habit now
that he’s dead

Paul realizes his misstep Kay won’t let him back down
Luckily -

SCOTTY (0S)
Kay

Kay turns to see SCOTTY RESTON (60s white-templed) standing
there a warm smile on his face The tension broken Paul
heaves a deep sigh of relief

KAY
Scotty

He kisses her on the cheek Lally gives him a hug clearly
they all know each other

KAY (CONT’D)
Joe you know Scotty Reston

ALSOP
Of course

They shake hands

ARCHIE
Isn’t this crossing enemy lines
The Times and Post on the same
terrain

ALSOP
Ignore my friends - they live for
drama

SCOTTY
Don’t we all
(to Kay)
Can I borrow you for a moment

KAY
Of course

He takes her elbow and gently leads her away from the party

KAY (CONTD)
Are you alright Is Sally

SCOTTY
Yes yes - nothing like that

He shoves his hands in his pockets Clearly nervous

SCOTTY (CONT’D)
I wasn’t sure if I - I think I
should’ve told you earlier but
well I hope you understand why I
didn’t I wasn’t sure we were going
to print until this morning The
lawyers -

KAY
Does this have something to do with
the call I got from Bob

SCOTTY
(stunned)
McNamara What’d he say

INT WARSH HOUSE GEORGETOWN - SAME TIME

Howard and Bradlee accept another round from the bartender
Bradlee looks at his drink spinning it absentmindedly

HOWARD
Everything OK with you You were
pretty on today
BRADLEE
You looking for my confession

HOWARD
Not drinking enough for that

Bradlee lights a cigarette A moment passes

BRADLEE
I’m just tired of losing And I’m
even more tired of weighing
everything on whether we lost or
not There used to be a reason for
all of this

HOWARD
There is We tell people the truth
about things they don’t want to
hear

BRADLEE
Like every detail of Tricia Nixon’s
wedding C’mon

HOWARD
If you think that then what’s the
point

BRADLEE

Because I used to be good at
getting a story Fighting for it
Now I’m just management

Howard watches him not knowing what to say

BRADLEE (CONTD)
You know Meyer passed her over for
the job once before

Howard gives Bradlee a look

BRADLEE (CONTD)
Instead of leaving her the paper -
he left it to Phil Her husband

HOWARD
(whistling)
Well that tells you something

BRADLEE
It does I’m just not sure if it
says more about him or her

HOWARD
(quiet)
It says that if you want a good
party you call Kay Graham A paper
run There’s a whole list of names
that come first

Charlotte Warsh approaches them
BRADLEE
Yea well we went through those -

they keep dying on us

Charlotte taps Bradlee on the shoulder

CHARLOTTE
Chushed)
Mrs Graham is on the phone for
you
BRADLEE

Youre joking

HOWARD
Speak of the devil and she will -

Bradlee shoots Howard a look

INT KITCHEN WARSH HOUSE - A MOMENT LATER
Bradlee picks up the phone A shopping list is taped to it
BRADLEE
(skeptical)

This is Bradlee
His expression changes upon realizing that it’s actually Kay
Then turns to anger when he hears what she has to say
INT LOBBY CONSTITUTION HALL - A LITTLE LATER
Kay hangs up the payphone in the empty lobby - the sounds of
the party wafting in from outside She stands there for a
moment processing Then straightens her posture puts her
face on and heads back towards the music

INT CONFERENCE ROOM WASHINGTON POST - LATER

Meg Bagdikian and Geyelin sit at the table It’s the middle
of the night and they’ve all been dragged out of bed

GEYELIN
You know what this is about

MEG
Yea he asked me here at 2am then
revealed all his hopes and dreams

GEYELIN
(quiet)
Just asking

Bagdikian chuckles Through the glass they see the elevator
doors open and Bradlee storm out Howard is on his heels
Bradlee reaches the conference room where a few nearly empty
coffee cups sit on a nearby table Bradlee slaps them and
sends them flying into the wall The trio jumps

BAGDIKIAN
Ben What the -

BRADLEE
I’m getting really goddamn tired of
finding out we’re being scooped by
the goddamn publisher

Everyone is silenced In the background Gene steps of the
elevator and sees what is happening Bradlee pulls out the
shopping list -

BRADLEE (CONT’D)
According to Scotty Reston of the
New York Times they have over
“7000 documents detailing how the
White House has lied about the
Vietnam War for the past 30 years”

Geyelin sits back in his seat Gene approaches The night
shift in the office gathers to see the show

BRADLEE (CONT’D)
Sheehan’s first article comes out
Sunday then they’1ll be doing a
series about the documents every
day They’re going after the White
House with proof that there were
ulterior motives from the beginning
for sending our guys there Proof
that they lied that they hid it
from the public and that they
documented the whole thing

He lets this all settle in

BRADLEE (CONT’D)

They’ve been going over the
material for three months Three
months And I had to find out from -

GEYELIN
Howd -

Meg goes to shush him but it’s too late -

BRADLEE
It doesn’t matter how she found
out She did it before any of you

GENE
(quietly)
Ben

BRADLEE
You’ve got twenty-four hours before
the story hits and I’d like to have
a little more goddman warning of
what it’s going to say than what I
already have

GENE
(a little forceful)
Ben
BRADLEE
What

After a moment Bradlee takes a breath He looks back at the
table - the editors look like puppies kicked when they’re
down Bradlee throws the shopping list on the table and
storms out

INT PHIL’S OFFICE GRAHAM HOUSE - NIGHT
The lights come on Kay in her robe stands in the doorway
It’s not dusty but feels oddly untouched She steps in
standing across from the large wooden desk On a bookshelf
rests a number of framed photos Phil Graham (handsome
lanky) featured in most of them One shows he and Kay on
their wedding day - youthful optimistic but with Kay still
carrying a weight on her shoulders Later photos show him
with LBJ Kennedy their children her father Bradlee She
lingers for a moment Considering

INT KITCHEN GRAHAM HOUSE - NIGHT

Lally sits at the table reading the article from earlier
Kay steps in Lally looks up

KAY
Can’t sleep

Lally shakes her head Kay sees what she is reading and
frowns moving to the stove

KAY (CONT’D)
Tea

LALLY
OK

A moment passes Kay fills the teapot
KAY

What time is Yann dropping
Katharine off tomorrow

LALLY
He said 10
KAY
And he won’t stay
LALLY
(warning)

Mom

Kay offers a thin smile and nods backing off She sits while
the water boils

KAY
(re the magazine)
I thought I’d thrown that out

No she didn’t

LALLY
It’s a it’s a good article

The page is open to a photograph of Kay laughing with Truman
Capote at the Black and White Ball A different version of her
than the one in the boardroom - glamorous in her element

LALLY (CONTD)
(gentle)
I just wish that maybe youd
take I don’t know a little more
pride in -

KAY
Pride I can -

LALLY
That’s not the right word You just
- you come across like - I don’t
know You’re in one of the most
powerful positions in the country
Mom And it just seems like you
don’t want it There’s a lot of
people who look up to you

KAY
I think that’s a bit dramatic

The teapot sings ending the conversation Kay pours them
tea Lally moves on

LALLY
So what will happen now

Kay gives her a look

LALLY (CONT’D)
With The Times With what they’re
printing

KAY
I’m not sure It’s in Mr Bradlee’s
hands at the moment

LALLY
But aren’t you curious

KAY
Of course but it’s not my place to
interfere

LALLY
Didn’t you get them the story

KAY
You don’t understand how it works

Lally goes to speak but realizes it’s a moot point

KAY (CONTD)
Your father always seemed to have
the right answer

(beat)

At the meeting today Paul and
Marvin well they feel that the
Board and the trust should share
the same voting power

Lally is taken aback

LALLY
That’s crazy It’s never -

KAY
It will be fine I spoke with Fritz
and he’s going to take care of it
I was just I was surprised
That’s all

LALLY
(treading carefully)
Did they ever suggest anything
like this when Dad was in charge

KAY
No No Absolutely not Phil
would’ve never stood for it

LALLY
So why are you

Kay stares at her a beat

LALLY (CONTD)
I mean I know Dad had a
different relationship with them -

KAY
Yes of course -

LALLY
Why wouldn’t you just tell them
it’s not going to happen

KAY
That just wouldn’t be appropriate

Lally sighs exasperated

INT BRADLEE’S OFFICE WASHINGTON POST - MORNING

Bradlee sits on the phone same clothes as the night before
Howard across from him Gene walks in

GENE
Anything

HOWARD
Nope He’s on the phone with a kid
from our New York office Sent them
to the hotel
BRADLEE
(into phone)
What do you mean you ran away

GENE
Hotel

HOWARD
The Times has the 11th floor of the
Hilton

BRADLEE

(into phone)
Yes I understand

GENE
I’m sorry

Bradlee hangs up

BRADLEE
The New York Times is squatting on
the 11th floor of the Hilton with
two guards standing watch outside
the door

HOWARD
What happened

BRADLEE
Our guys got so spooked they
pretended to be lost and ran in the
opposite direction

HOWARD
What do you mean ran

BRADLEE
I mean when you go from one point
to the other and you don’t walk

HOWARD
What else did they say

BRADLEE
Not a whole lot We heard anything
from the White House

GENE
They’ve been busy all weekend

Bradlee gives him a look
HOWARD
The wedding

BRADLEE
That fucking wedding

GENE
All they’re saying is the documents
didn’t come from them

HOWARD
Which we know is bullshit because
the only thing that would make this
story stick would be documents from
the inside

Bradlee checks his watch

BRADLEE
So it’s 9am and we’ve got guards
outside a hotel room the White
House denying any knowledge of
documents that were most likely
created inside the White House
and

HOWARD
And McNamara’s call

Bradlee stares at him

BRADLEE
Hm

HOWARD
The call From McNamara

This sticks with Bradlee Bagdikian walks in

BRADLEE
You got something

BAGDIKIAN
(shaking his head)
They’re not budging I’m trying to
get a hold of a guy I used to know
when I was there Left a couple
months ago and I can’t seem to find
him Ellsberg Dan

GENE
He’s kind of a quack isn’t he

HOWARD
I remember him - he was down here
for awhile working on something
Doved real quick

BRADLEE
(absentmindedly)
If the leak didn’t come from the
White House why is McNamara
calling us

Bradlee stands moving towards the door

BRADLEE (CONTD)
Bags - find Ellsberg

HOWARD
Where’re you going

BRADLEE
To talk to Mrs Graham because she
seems to be the only one who can
get any answers

GENE
She’s not here

BRADLEE
Why not

GENE
It’s the weekend

BRADLEE
Where is she

GENE
I don’t know Home

Bradlee walks out Howard sighs -
HOWARD

That’s going to go well
EXT BACKYARD GRAHAM HOUSE - A LITTLE LATER
Kay sits in an Adirondack chair next to Lally going over
some documents Her expression one of concern The grass is
getting long and unkempt rising well above the ankles
Playing a few yards away is KATHARINE (5 tow-headed) Kay’s

granddaughter She runs her hands through the grass which is
now itching Kay The doorbell rings Kay’s brow furrows

LALLY
Were you expecting someone

KAY
No

LALLY
I’1l go check

Lally leaves Kay looks back to Katharine and watches her
play in the yard A look of concern begins to cloud Kay’s
face as Katharine begins to twirl in the grass

KAY
Katharine slow down

Katharine giggles and starts spinning faster her feet
pounding the ground and her arms out beside her

KAY (CONTD)
Katherine I said stop

Katharine doesn’t hear her she throws her arms above her
head and in one violent leap loses her balance and crumbles
to the ground hidden in the tall grass Kay is up in an
instant rushing to her granddaughter

KAY (CONTD)
Katharine Lally Lally

Kay approaches fearful of what she’ll find where Katharine
was once in action She finds Katharine on her back gazing
at the sky a look of fascination on her face Her arms move
as if she’s making a “grass” angel In the background Lally
runs toward them

KAY (CONTD)
(panicked)
Are you alright

KATHARINE
Look

KAY
You scared me I asked you to -

KATHARINE
(pointing)
Look It’s red

Kay looks up to the sky and sees the rising moon is a deep
red Kay seems to get momentarily lost in the sight of it

KATHARINE (CONT’D)
Isn’t it pretty

Kay looks from the sky to her granddaughter and back again
surprised at the natural wonder of the child She’s
unaccustomed to such unhindered joy and curiosity - something
she’s always kept at bay

KAY
(quiet)
It’s beautiful
LALLY
(confused)
What What is it

Kay snaps out of the daze

KAY
Oh It was nothing

LALLY
Nothing

KAY
Yes I’m sorry I -

She looks to the back door and sees Bradlee standing there
LALLY
He said he needs to ask you
something

INT KITCHEN GRAHAM HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

Kay hands Bradlee some water They can see Lally and
Katharine playing out the window

KAY
This is very inappropriate

BRADLEE
Well I’m here So Is that your
granddaughter

KAY

Yes What did you want to ask me
No small talk is fine with him
BRADLEE

Do you have any idea why McNamara
called you
KAY
He’s an old friend

BRADLEE
Yes

KAY
He trusts me

BRADLEE
Yes

He waits for more she doesn’t give it

KAY
Maybe I don’t understand the
question

BRADLEE
We’re still piecing together what
it is exactly that The Times is
printing We’re not going to get
their source in time -

KAY
Why not

He’s a bit taken aback

He steams

BRADLEE
Because finding a source is like
finding a -

KAY
I don’t need a metaphor Mr
Bradlee

BRADLEE
Well it’s extraordinarily
difficult Mrs Graham I haven’t
been a writer in a while so the
haystack comparison is really the
only one I can come up with right
now

KAY
Alright

BRADLEE
But if you could get McNamara to
talk to us well that would be
helpful and -

KAY
(confused)
Talk to you About what

BRADLEE
About whatever it is that The Times
is printing

KAY
What makes you -

BRADLEE

(exasperated)
Mrs Graham the former Secretary
of Defense called you because he
knows what’s in that article He
knows what’s in those documents
Which means he either wrote them or
organized them or found them I
honestly don’t care which one
because he’s one of two people we
know of who can tell me about it
and the only one whose name I have

She purses her lips

KAY
Well I’m sorry Mr Bradlee but
youll have to find another way

BRADLEE

(stunned)
Excuse me

KAY
Bob McNamara is an old friend who
spoke to me in confidence Not as a
source Not as a subject

BRADLEE
He spoke to you because you’re the
publisher of a newspaper and he was
hoping you’d bail him out

KAY

BRADLEE
(heated)
He spoke to you because he was
hoping to get you on his side and
banking on the fact that I wouldn’t
notice

KAY
Mr Bradlee

BRADLEE
I don’t know if I can articulate
just how important it is that we
get -

KAY
You have but my answer is no I
will not exploit a friendship of
over twenty years for -

BRADLEE
Unfortunately that’s the position
that you’re in We exploit
friendships and acquaintances and
sources to find the information we
need because the end is better than
the means

KAY
I’m not a journalist Mr Bradlee
And I’m not going to change my
mind

Bradlee grits his jaw thinking for a moment

BRADLEE
Are you trying to tell me I
shouldn’t go after this story

KAY
That’s not what I -

BRADLEE
Because Ill just walk out of the
bullpen right now if that’s how
it’s going to be

She’s taken aback by his ferocity

BRADLEE (CONTD)
I need to know that you’re going to
print these documents if we get
them

A moment passes

KAY
(firm)
I absolutely will not guarantee
that Mr Bradlee
(MORE )

KAY (CONTD)
I have no idea what is in them who
it might expose what relationships
it could damage if we -

BRADLEE
Relationships

He shakes his head and rises
BRADLEE (CONTD)
When we fail this will be on you
Thank you for the water I’1l see
myself out

He exits leaving Kay stunned She looks out the window and
sees Katharine twirling in the grass smiling up at the sky

EXT VARIOUS WASHINGTON DC - NIGHT

protesters linger around

INT BULLPEN WASHINGTON POST - LATE NIGHT

Bagdikian’s desk is empty In the background he waits for

the coffee to percolate He hasn’t slept or left the office

in over a day There are other people in other cubicles who
have been doing the exact same thing His phone rings He
doesn’t hear it at first Finally he runs over and grabs it -

BAGDIKIAN
Bagdikian

His mood changes

BAGDIKIAN (CONT’D)
Who is this

He seems satisfied with the answer and grabs a pen writing
as he nods his head

BAGDIKIAN (CONT’D)
Sure yes - I’ve got it

He hangs up grabs his jacket and takes off

EXT BRADLEE HOUSE - DAWN

Bradlee stands on his front porch in his robe watching as
TWO TRUCKS make their morning deliveries one for The Times
and one for The Post

He smokes a cigarette and waits for them to drive off Then
he carefully walks across his neighbor’s yard where a Times
paper has been dropped off Checking to make sure no one sees
him he grabs the paper and runs back to his porch He opens
to the front page and reads “PENTAGON STUDY TRACES 3 DECADES
OF GROWING US INVOLVEMENT” He frowns

INT BOARDROOM WASHINGTON POST - DAY

The same boardmembers sit at the table Ignatius has a copy
of the Times next to him The tension is palpable Fritz and
Kay listen while Ignatius speaks

IGNATIUS
I think it’s clear after the
events of this weekend that I was
correct in suggesting we rethink
the voting percentages

FRITZ
How do you mean

IGNATIUS
Excuse me

FRITZ
What does this weekend have to do
with that

IGNATIUS
The failure of The Washington Post
to properly investigate and report
on a story that The New York Times
has dedicated the better half of
this year to

FRITZ

Have you read The Times’ article
IGNATIUS

Of course
FRITZ

So you’ll agree it’s damning
IGNATIUS

Damning
FRITZ

To the White House

IGNATIUS
Well it’s -

FRITZ
And this morning the White House
filed an injunction against the
Times It was approved an hour ago

MARVIN
What

FRITZ
A restraining order The Times is
prohibited from printing anymore of
the documents until there is a
hearing

Kay smiles letting Fritz fight for her

FRITZ (CONTD)
So I’m just confused - do you want
us to embarrass the White House or
stand with them

Ignatius stutters

INT HALLWAY WASHINGTON POST - A LITTLE LATER
Kay and Fritz approach her office

FRITZ
That’s not going to hold him back -
hell figure out another way to
discredit you in front of the
Board

KAY
Can he really take away my voting
rights

FRITZ
(hesitating)
Technically no But he can calla
vote to have you removed and that
will put into question the -

KAY
(stunned)
Removed
FRITZ

I’m afraid so

KAY
But -

FRITZ
Don’t worry if Phil wasn’t booted
off you have nothing to worry
about

She nods her head - unsure A moment passes

FRITZ (CONT’D)
You read the article

KAY
(solemn)
Of course

FRITZ
(re the papers)
Horrible The audacity of - I wish
I was more surprised

He expects her to respond in unison but she doesn’t

FRITZ (CONTD)
Do you think Bradlee will go after
the documents

KAY
It seems that way

FRITZ
We can’t get pulled into some kind
of legal battle over this Kay Not
now It could jeopardize -

KAY

(loaded)
I don’t think it will come to that

FRITZ
Let’s hope not

He moves off she’s more concerned now than ever She
approaches Liz’s desk there is a stack of letters

LIZ

(gentle)
More of the letters came in today

Kay furrows her brow and sees a return address on one of the
envelopes reads “EQUAL PAY FOR WOMEN” Kay extends her hand

KAY
I’1l take them

LIZ
Are you sure They’re not -

KAY
Yes

Liz hands her the pile and Kay heads into her office

INT BULLPEN WASHINGTON POST - DAY

INT BRADLEE’S OFFICE WASHINGTON POST - MOMENTS LATER

Bradlee sits in his chair and looks down at a Post story in
front of him He reads

BRADLEE
“As reported by the New York
Times”

He sighs and throws a pen at the wall Frustrated Angry
There are lots of other little dents in the wall from pens
that have been thrown there before He stares out at the
bullpen mulling over the next move The elevator doors open
and Bagdikian speeds out Bradlee watches him as he awkwardly
hurries into his office

BRADLEE (CONT’D)
Bags what the hell are you doing

BAGDIKIAN
I need to go to Boston

BRADLEE

BAGDIKIAN
I gotta talk to a guy
Bradlee smiles and closes his office door

BRADLEE
You find Ellsberg

BAGDIKIAN
He found me Or someone we know -
it’s not important

BRADLEE
Is he the Times’ source Does he
still have the documents

BAGDIKIAN
I need to go to Boston

BRADLEE
Alright
(beat)
You’re still standing here

BAGDIKIAN
He’s not going to give me the
documents unless I promise we’1ll
print them

BRADLEE
We don’t know what they say yet

BAGDIKIAN
Still I’1ll have to say something

Bradlee thinks a moment

BRADLEE
If what’s in these documents is as
good as we think you can tell him
that if we don’t print there’ll be
a new executive editor at the
Washington Post

BAGDIKIAN
(taken aback)

Whatever is said doesn’t please Bagdikian

BAGDIKIAN (CONT’D)

the door He looks up surprised to see Kay standing there
His mood is icy

BRADLEE
Mrs Graham

KAY
My secretary gave me your note

She holds a slip in her hand

BRADLEE
You didn’t need to come down I
just wanted to let you know where
we stood

She nods her head once considering

KAY
May I come in

He gestures to the chair in front of him She sits and takes
in the sight of the office - she hasn’t been in here since he
took the job He knows this

KAY (CONTD)
Mr Bagdikian is on his way to
Boston

BRADLEE
Should be there by now

KAY
Who is he meeting with

Beat

BRADLEE
I’m not going to tell you that

She nods - understanding the protection of a source

KAY
You think he’1ll be able to retrieve
the documents

BRADLEE
(loaded)
I hope so

KAY
That’s quite a coup

BRADLEE
Weve got good reporters

She purses her lips
KAY
You’re going to stay until you hear

from him

BRADLEE
It’ll be awhile

KAY
Your wife doesn’t mind you staying
so late

BRADLEE

She minds But here I am

KAY
And your children

He looks at his watch -

Excuse me

She points to a photo of Bradlee and JFK

KAY
Being close with the President
Being a journalist and his friend

BRADLEE
Only when someone pointed it out

KAY
Phil never felt awkward about
it He liked being able to call the
President and for him to answer

BRADLEE
A lot of things were different back
then

Beat Kay’s eyes stay with the photos Bradlee’s on her

KAY
I think my father found personal
effects to be distracting too

BRADLEE
I have some

KAY
Most people have things on their
desk though don’t they Yours seem
to be watching over you

BRADLEE
I’ve never thought about it

KAY
Of course you have

BRADLEE

There are a lot of reporters on my
staff who don’t ask this many

questions

KAY
I wanted to be one once a long
time ago

BRADLEE

On my staff
She’s annoyed by his snark He forces a smile then
into his desk and pulls out a bottle of scotch and
He pours -

He offers her the glass after a beat she takes it

finishes his coffee then refills it with liquor

Bagdikian sits at a ratty table Ellsberg opposite

corner filled with papers

ELLSBERG
Sorry about the rigmarole getting
here

BAGDIKIAN

A lot of guys looking for you

A moment passes

ELLSBERG

How’d you figure it was me
BAGDIKIAN

Sounded like something a crazy guy

would do
He’s half-joking Ellsberg laughs

BAGDIKIAN (CONTD)
I poked around at Rand They got
nervous when I mentioned your name

ELLSBERG
What do you know

BAGDIKIAN
The basics You were part of a team
set up at the DoD to gather
information on Vietnam

ELLSBERG
(almost wistful)

McNamara would say “let the chips
fall where they may” He wanted
scholars to have the opportunity to
examine Vietnam policy - all
angles I loved it

ELLSBERG (CONTD)
I loved the guys - the work We had
access to everything I mean how
often does that happen you know

BAGDIKIAN

But

ELLSBERG
(shrugging)
What else “but” we found
something

Bagdikian holds his breath Ellsberg lights a cigarette his
hand shakes

ELLSBERG (CONTD)
None of it was ever about helping
Vietnam

BAGDIKIAN
What was it about

ELLSBERG
What’s it always about Self-
interest Expansion Making sure we
had the final say

BAGDIKIAN
But how -

ELLSBERG
It was us From the beginning
Covert Ops rigged elections
guaranteed debt It’s all in there -
memos studies cables Since the
40s they’ve been doing this The
CIA NSA DoD the White House
80 of it is classified They knew
all along that we were sending men -
boys - not to fight but to die
The knew because they started it
all And they planned it from the
start Then they knew that we were
going to lose But they kept
sending those boys over anyway

The truth hangs between them for a moment

BAGDIKIAN
If there’s nothing in there about
Nixon - why does he care He must
love how it makes the Democrats -
ELLSBERG
You think Nixon wants you guys to
be able to start publishing
materials like this Nixon may not
be in these but I guarantee he’s
got something in a drawer he
doesn’t want anyone to find

I don’t know that it’s worth the
risk

BRADLEE

You know what I think
She purses her lips - this should be good

BRADLEE (CONT’D)
I think you want to help I think
youre hiding behind your title
because you’re afraid of making the
wrong move when we both know you’ve
spent just as much time in an
office like this as anybody

KAY
You don’t like me very much do

BRADLEE

I - don’t think my opinion matters -

Bradlee

KAY
Unfortunately it does to me

BRADLEE
Why does it matter I’m -

KAY
Call it a woman’s problem

BRADLEE
(scowling)
Don’t do that Don’t bring up the
woman thing again

KAY
I am one

BRADLEE
Yes But that doesn’t mean you need
to act how a woman thinks a man
thinks a woman should act like

KAY
Not the interview again

BRADLEE
I just don’t understand it You’re
running this massive company All
this responsibility on you and I
mean - it’s not 1952 and you’re not
running around getting the old boys
their coffee

KAY
Yet you think it’s appropriate to
yell at me about how to do my job

BRADLEE
Yes Because you’re not doing it

KAY
Would you speak to Phil that way

BRADLEE
I was never in charge of Phil’s -

KAY
If you had been

BRADLEE
Suppositions don’t suit anyone

KAY
Mr Bradlee -

BRADLEE

(annoyed heated)
No I wouldn’t have to yell at Phil
about that I would’ve had to about
a dozen other things but not that
Because he would’ve made the call
before I even walked in the door
This was his paper Phil knew that
And he knew that his influence his
opinion mattered It was the
opinion of the Washington Post And
you Mrs Graham your opinion for
better or worse is the opinion of
the Washington Post If you don’t
believe you should be running it
why the hell should I

Kay looks at her glass the honesty hitting them both He’s a
little embarrassed by his outburst The moment hangs there

KAY

What you don’t seem to understand
is that it’s not about what I want
It’s never been about that It’s
about what is right for the paper
That’s what comes first

(beat)
That’s what has always come first

BRADLEE
But can’t you -

KAY
I’ve been getting some of those
letters too

(beat)

Everyone seems to have an opinion
on how I’m supposed to behave You
The Board My daughter I walked
around like my father they’d call
me a narcissist If I behaved like
Phil they’d have me committed much -

BRADLEE
Well -

KAY
- faster than he was I’m left with
no real option except to let all of
this keep spinning while I try to
make sure it doesn’t slip off its
axis

BRADLEE
It is slipping You’re just too
busy trying to keep up appearances
that you haven’t noticed

This hits her hard She processes
BRADLEE (CONTD)
I think you want to help But
that’s what everyone says

The phone rings startling them both Bradlee picks it up

BRADLEE (CONTD)

Bags

(listening)
Great We’ll see you in a few
hours

He hangs up

BRADLEE (CONT’D)
He’s got the documents He’s headed
back now

She nods and rises to leave

KAY
Youll keep me informed

BRADLEE
Of course

KAY
I’m throwing Harry Gladstein a
retirement party tomorrow night If
I cancel people will know
something is going on

He nods She stops at the door

KAY (CONTD)
Do you think Phil would print them

BRADLEE

(sighs)
I can’t answer that

She nods once

KAY
Have a good night Mr Bradlee

BRADLEE
Good night Mrs Graham

She leaves He stares at her empty glass for a moment

EXT BRADLEE HOUSE - MORNING

It’s early the morning light casting a beautiful glow on the
semi-suburban neighborhood A few extra cars are parked in
the driveway and MARINA BRADLEE sits at a table selling
lemonade Trudging along from afar is Bagdikian the box of
papers weighing heavily in his arms He looks awful

MARINA
Lemonade

He doesn’t respond or stop a man on a mission

INT KITCHEN BRADLEE HOUSE - SAME TIME

Meg Howard and Geyelin all crowd around the kitchen Tony
tries to make coffee as quickly as possible but the reporters
keep gulping it down Bradlee hangs up the phone

BRADLEE
The Times is going to lose their
appeal

The mood in the room falls a bit

INT LIVING ROOM BRADLEE HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

The front door opens and closes the reporters peek their
heads around the corner as Bagdikian walks in He drops the
box on the ground then goes to the living room and lies on
the couch It’s a feeding frenzy they grab handfuls of paper
and start to read Bradlee approaches Bagdikian

BRADLEE
You OK Bags

BAGDIKIAN
(eyes closed)
Yea I just - need a minute

Bradlee smiles and smacks him on the shoulder Meg goes
through some pages -

MEG
Wait - are these in order

HOWARD
Doesn’t look like it -

MEG
Bags did you see if they were
organized in some -

BAGDIKIAN
This is how they came to me

MEG
It’s more than

She looks to Geyelin who in turn looks to Bradlee
GEYELIN
We can’t sort through this much
stuff in time to -

Bradlee’s expression quiets him

HOWARD
The Times had three months we -

BRADLEE
(checking his watch)
Have nine hours

The editors stare at him They don’t move

MEG
I think it’s it might be -

GEYELIN
It’s a tall order

In the background Marina approaches Bagdikian with a cup of
lemonade He smiles and reaches for it she pulls back

MARINA
10 cents

He scowls but reaches into his pocket she grins

BRADLEE
What

Marina glances at her father - she’s heard that tone before
This is about to get bad She goes to get more lemonade

GEYELIN
I just -
BRADLEE
What does that mean “it’s a tall
order”

MEG

He’s saying -

BRADLEE
He’s saying it’s not worth it It’s
too hard Why even bother - The
Times has done it already They’ve
got everyone talking so why waste
our time

HOWARD
That’s not -

BRADLEE
That’s exactly what he’s saying

The room is quiet

BRADLEE (CONTD)

For the last six months hell for
the last two years we’ve been
taking what they give us and now
when we have something and we can
do something about it - no No We
don’t want to do that

(beat)
Because it’s a tall order

(beat)
I can’t be the only one who cares
about this Because if that happens
I get mad and every else gets fired
and we’re all screwed in the end

He goes to the box and grabs a stack of papers then sits

and

begins to sort through them After a moment the rest of the

team does so as well

INT RESTAURANT GEORGETOWN - SAME TIME

Kay walks in looking around for someone She spots ROBERT
McNAMARA (50s) sitting at a table by himself reading the

paper eating breakfast She approaches He looks up
surprised then instantly knowing why she’s there

MCNAMARA
Hello Kay

KAY
Hello Bob
She takes

MCNAMARA

Please Sit

the seat across from him After a moment

KAY
Are you alright

MCNAMARA
I’ve had articles written about me
before

KAY

Not like this

MCNAMARA
No Not like this

Bob -

MCNAMARA
Do you know what I did at Ford

KAY
(puzzled)
You were the President I assume
you -

MCNAMARA
All anyone cared about was selling
cars All that mattered was how
they looked how they sounded how
they felt No one saw a car like I
saw it - like a weapon

She’s listening but - where’s this going

MCNAMARA (CONTD)
I wanted them to put in seat belts
But they said “Well if you put
the seat belt in there all
anyone’s thinking about is their
kid’s head going through the
windshield” It didn’t matter that
I had mountains of research to
prove otherwise Eventually I got
them to put it in as an option

KAY
Bob

MCNAMARA
I thought “At least I got them to
do that much” My conscience could
be clear For the most part Of
course it didn’t matter

KAY
Bob

MCNAMARA
The second I left for Washington
they took the seat belts away
People kept dying But - they kept
selling cars
(beat)
And they sure looked pretty

KAY
Bob why did you call me
Beat
MCNAMARA
I guess I was trying to give youa

seat belt

Meg and Geyelin are on the floor sorting things while Howard
reads the organized materials The room is tense Quiet

He and Meg exchange a look filled with anger sadness

MEG
The whole time when Johnson was
running and he was

She looks up at Howard

MEG (CONTD)
He’d sent the boys over there
already He was acting like it’d
never happen but he’d already
done it

Howard watches her sad It all sinking in

INT KITCHEN BRADLEE HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Bradlee sits at the table phone to ear head in hand The
cord is stretched inconveniently across the room so if anyone
wants to walk in they have to duck Tony makes sandwiches

BRADLEE
I’m still on hold

TONY
On hold with who

BRADLEE
Huh

TONY
Who are you on hold with

BRADLEE
The lawyers Supposedly Though at
this point they could’ve
transferred me to the Guam Embassy
and I wouldn’t know

TONY
You do that all the time

BRADLEE
Call Guam

TONY
Say something without knowing that
I’m here

Howard pokes his head in getting Bradlee’s attention

BRADLEE
Yea

HOWARD
(hushed)
Some of this stuff It’s it’s
heavy Even just going through it
I’m wondering if we could get Mrs
Graham to come and take a look
Tell us if -

BRADLEE
That’s not her job Howard

HOWARD
(annoyed)
Then what is Because we’re sitting
here going through all of -

BRADLEE
(firm)
Go back to work

After a moment Howard does Bradlee watches him go Tony
turns to him

TONY
There’s an embassy for Guam

BRADLEE
Of course there’s an embassy for -
(into receiver)
Yes Yes This is Ben Bradlee Of
the Washington Post I’m trying to
get -

He’s clearly put on hold again He slaps his hand on the
table four times - each one harder than the last

TONY
It might help if you were more
condescending Why don’t you just
call Mrs Graham

BRADLEE
Hm
TONY
Jesus -
BRADLEE
I was teasing that time I can
tease

No he can’t

BRADLEE (CONT’D)
Because if I call Mrs Graham
without knowing what the lawyers
are going to say then the first
thing she’s going to do is call the
lawyers and I’1l be on hold with
both of them At least this one
cuts out the middle man

TONY
Except you’re still on hold

He glances over at her

BRADLEE
What are you doing back there

TONY
Making sandwiches

BRADLEE
For who

She stares at him and shakes her head She puts the
sandwiches on a platter and walks out ducking under the
cord The front door opens - Bradlee turns He sees ROGER
CLARK (late 30s) ANTHONY ESSAYE (40s) and a few other
LAWYERS arrive

CLARK
Mr Bradlee
BRADLEE
Who are you
CLARK
We’re from Royall Koegell and

Wells
Koegell is pronounced “Kegel”
HOWARD
(to Meg re Koegell)
What’d he say

She would roll her eyes but she’s too tired

BRADLEE
The lawyers
CLARK
That’s right
BRADLEE
(irritated)
Who the hell am I on hold to talk
to then
CLARK

Probably me

Bradlee slams the phone down and walks to them -

INT LIVING ROOM BRADLEE HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

BRADLEE
Your firm needs to work on its
communication skills

CLARK
We’ll get right on that
He extends his hand -

CLARK (CONT’D)

Bradlee shakes it briefly and walks towards the back

BRADLEE
OK Follow me

MEG
Ben - I think we need to get a
writer over here We’re going to
need to get someone -

BRADLEE
Call Chalmers

MEG
He’s not going to be happy about
that

Bradlee kicks the couch waking a sleeping Bagdikian

BRADLEE (CONT’D)

He turns and heads into another room Bagdikian Clark and
Assaye follow behind The remainder stare at each other
INT RESTAURANT GEORGETOWN - SAME TIME

An empty tea cup sits in front of Kay a silent tension rests
between the old friends

KAY
We have the papers

MCNAMARA
You shouldn’t be telling me that

KAY
You shouldn’t have called

He nods conceding
KAY (CONTD)
I haven’t decided what we’re going
to do with them yet

MCNAMARA
I’m not sure I’m the one to help
you decide

KAY
That’s not I just wanted to -

Her mask begins slipping why is she there

Beat

KAY (CONT’D)
I guess I thought if I heard from

you what they were why it
might make it easier Or I don’t
know

MCNAMARA

(shaking his head)
It’s not going to be easy

KAY
I keep hoping

KAY (CONTD)
Can I ask you - we’ve been friends
a long time

MCNAMARA
Yes

She steels herself to ask this tough question

McNamara’s eyes are on the table unmoving She’s well

KAY
Well I just you knew Don was
volunteering for the Army Why -
how - how could you not tell me Or
Phil How could you just let him
With everything that you knew

composed not overtly emotional She just wants an answer

KAY (CONTD)
I suppose you couldn’t have told me
but I can’t help thinking

Kay watches him seeing that she’s upset him

KAY (CONTD)
It’s alright Nevermind He’s home -
we don’t have to -

MCNAMARA
No I - I just wish I could tell
you that I

He trails off

MCNAMARA (CONTD)
We made mistakes All of us It
doesn’t excuse - nothing could
but well

He takes a moment gathering his thoughts

MCNAMARA (CONTD)
Maybe we did the right thing Maybe
we didn’t Who knows Maybe it’s
your job the job of the press
to I don’t know Keep us all
honest I’m not so sure if people
should know everything But I
I’m not sure anyone has a right to
make that decision for them

She thinks

KAY
(soft)
I’m not sure I can

MCNAMARA
Can or not I think you’re going to
have to decide one way or the
other

She nods Still so unsure

INT LIVING ROOM BRADLEE HOUSE - A LITTLE LATER

Meg Geyelin and the lawyers continue to sift through the
documents in a tense peace New at the table is CHALMERS
ROBERTS (60s big ears Chief Diplomatic Correspondent) The
voices in the library can be faintly heard

CHALMERS
(annoyed )
You guys couldn’t have called me
any earlier
MEG
We just got the papers Chal

CHALMERS
Mmhm

He reads shaking his head at what he’s reading
MEG

Why would the Director of the CIA
send a memo on war policy

GEYELIN
Because they weren’t calling ita
war yet

MEG

But they’re bombing -

CHALMERS
(to himself)
I was supposed to retire on Friday

INT LIBRARY BRADLEE HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
Bradlee paces Bagdikian has a fresh drink
CLARK

Look I understand that you’re
worried about -

BRADLEE
No you don’t
CLARK
- the exposure and the perception

of the paper -

BRADLEE
That’s exactly what -

There’s a knock on the door

BRADLEE (CONTD)
WHAT

Fritz enters -

FRITZ
I hate to barge in

Clark stands and shakes Fritz’s hand

CLARK
Mr Beebe we’re trying to explain

Fritz walks over to Bradlee and shakes his hand

FRITZ
You look terrible

BRADLEE
That’s what I was going for

FRITZ
(to Bagdikian)
You alright

Bagdikian shrugs

BRADLEE
He’s fine

Bradlee’s hackles are up - with Fritz here he knows there’s
no more messing around Fritz takes a seat

FRITZ
You want to catch me up Ben

BRADLEE
Sure They say we can’t I say we
can You’re caught up

FRITZ
(to Clark)
Go ahead
CLARK

Ignoring the fact that the
documents could be represented as
stolen property and therefore -

BRADLEE
We didn’t steal anything

CLARK
But they were -

BRADLEE
Not by -

CLARK
Regardless of that And forgetting
that we don’t know what is going to
happen with The Times case -

BRADLEE
What’s going to happen is -

Fritz puts up his hand for a second Bradlee stops

CLARK
As I said Forgetting all of that
We simply don’t have the time to
vet these documents The majority
of what we’re dealing with is
classified information and we don’t
know what’s in them I don’t
understand why it isn’t the most
prudent to simply wait and ask -

BRADLEE
(bursting)
Because we lost

Fritz looks at him the lawyers watch

BRADLEE (CONTD)
Why can’t we wait Because we’ve
already waited three months and
four days longer than we should’ve
We’ve got egg on our face and
unless we publish these documents
right now we might as well be some
shitty one stoplight no radio
town single edition paper

BRADLEE (CONTD)
We are the Washington Post We
aren’t anyone’s runner-up

Fritz thinks a moment

FRITZ
(to Bradlee)
The Post is going public next week

Bagdikian looks up - surprised Bradlee is disappointed

FRITZ (CONTD)
Our IPO is contingent on a series
of steps and markers that will
ensure to the -

BRADLEE
How’s it going to look when the
biggest property in the company
goes down because they didn’t have
the balls to stand up with the
Times

FRITZ
It’s not always about winning Ben

BRADLEE
(indignant)
Yes it is With this It is
entirely about winning I don’t
care what’s in those papers and I
don’t care who we make look bad
We’re printing them and -

FRITZ
That’s not your decision

A tense beat Bradlee hates that Fritz is right

ASSAYE
I have an idea

BRADLEE
Oh goodie

ASSAYE

What if we wait Hold off on
printing today -

Bradlee starts to interject Assaye speaks over him -

ASSAYE (CONT’D)
And instead we call the Attorney
General and tell them that we
intend to print the papers on
Sunday That way we give them and
ourselves time to figure out the
legality of it all Let the courts
decide what will happen with the
Times Just - give ourselves some
breathing room

Bagdikian Fritz and Bradlee stare at him Clark keeps his
head down A long moment passes

BRADLEE
(sotto)
You want to tell the Attorney
General that we have these

documents and are going to print
them In a few days

ASSAYE
(less sure)
Yes

Bradlee looks back at Bagdikian then Fritz

BRADLEE
That’s the shittiest idea I’ve ever
heard

FRITZ
Ben -

Bradlee walks towards the door

BRADLEE
You know what Hang on let me go
talk to my eleven-year-old and see
if she has a better plan

He leaves slamming the door behind him

Having a nice time

Ignatius stands there martini in hand Kay forces a smile

KAY
Bittersweet

IGNATIUS
Why’s that

KAY
Retirement parties tend to be
tinged with it

IGNATIUS
Oh is that what this is

KAY
Did you not see it on the
invitation

IGNATIUS
I’m not sure I received one

Kay absorbs the jab forcing that smile again She makes a
move to leave he subtly cuts her off Entertaining him is
not a task she needs right now

IGNATIUS (CONT’D)
I hope you weren’t offended by what
I said in the board room

KAY
(tense)
Offended isn’t the word Id use

IGNATIUS
However you might feel I hope you
know - I’ve always been impressed
by you

KAY
Excuse me

IGNATIUS
(genuine condescending)
Surprising as it may seem to hear
it The way you stood by Phil
during everything Even when he
well I guess there’s no need to
walk on a dead man’s name

Is he serious

IGNATIUS (CONT’D)
I never met him you know but I
always though we’d get along And
the way you handled yourself during
his - situation - with such
style However all of this works
out - I want you to know that I
have the best intentions towards -

KAY

(irate but calm)
Mr Ignatius this really isn’t the
time or place for the type of
conversation you’re wading into
But I can assure you I am well
aware of your intentions - good or
otherwise

BRADLEE
You give it the good stuff

TONY

BRADLEE
Could’ve guessed that

But your daughter made a killing
with her lemonade business

Bradlee smiles Tony watches him As much as she doesn’t want
to sometimes - she cares about this guy

TONY (CONTD)
What’s going on

BRADLEE
(shaking his head)
They’re idiots All they can see
are dollar signs vanishing in front
of them

TONY
Have you tried to convince -

BRADLEE
Of course I have

TONY
You sure All I heard was a lot of
“me” and “the paper” and -

BRADLEE
(scowling)
Tony -

TONY
Did you try and tell them what the
point of it all is

BRADLEE
The point of it

She shakes her head

TONY
I’1l never understand how you
convinced people you were so
perceptive

BRADLEE
What do you -

TONY
Did you even read -

But they’re interrupted with Bagdikian walking out - he looks
panicked

Bradlee raises his hand The phone rings

BAGDIKIAN (CONTD)
He went to tell her we can’t

publish
BRADLEE
No shit
BAGDIKIAN
Chushed)

No Ben It’s because of Ellsberg

BRADLEE
Nobody’s answering What’re you
talking about

BAGDIKIAN
He wanted to know if we had the
same source as the Times and -

Yes this is Ben Bradlee I’m
looking for -

BAGDIKIAN
He says -

BRADLEE
(growing frustrated)
I understand that it’s a party but
I promise that she -

BAGDIKIAN
(shouting)
He says we can be charged with
conspiracy to commit treason

That gets the attention of everyone Geyelin rises from his
chair the lawyers survey the room

BRADLEE
What

BAGDIKIAN
They could argue that we knew that
because it’s the same source as The
Times we knew we were getting
stolen documents I - I don’t know
I had one too many to catch it all -

BRADLEE
Shit

He hangs up the phone and grabs his keys

Bradlee stops and grits his jaw

BRADLEE
Enough

The volume startles everyone Tony pokes her head in from
outside

HOWARD
Ben it was just -

BRADLEE
No I’ve heard - you have no idea
what that woman is dealing with
What she’s been through The
pressure that we - you should just -

He stops himself getting blank stares He shakes his head

BRADLEE (CONTD)
You should just be better

He walks out his staff left both confused and hanging their
heads

INT GRAHAM HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

The HONOREE (60s) speaks to the crowd Kay stands to the
side smiling

HONOREE
Many of you are too young to
remember Mr Meyer so I’ll just
leave you with this Remember that
this this was a man’s life This
paper And he did it all for the
public For the readers He never
wanted anything in return I mean
he sunk so much money into it those
early years you’d a thought he was
trying to marry it

Laughs abound Kay digests these words Fritz walks in and
makes eye contact with Kay She’s slightly concerned by his
arrival Ignatius spots him too

HONOREE (CONTD)
But he believed it was his duty
his public service to put out the
paper every day Give people a
chance to read the news

Bradlee runs in A few guests notice shooting him wary
looks Bradlee pants beads of sweat rolling down his
temples He spots Fritz and approaches him

BRADLEE
You’re not talking to her without
me

FRITZ

Ben -

Ignatius approaches -

IGNATIUS
Mr Bradlee - are you alright

BRADLEE
(panting)
I had to run Who are you

Ignatius goes to speak but Kay approaches interrupting them
She gives Bradlee a once over

KAY
If we could take this outside

They follow her including Ignatius which surprises both
Fritz and Bradlee

EXT BACKYARD GRAHAM HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

Bradlee Fritz and Ignatius fight it out Kay sits nearby
listening and seemingly ignored by the three men She takes
it all in

FRITZ
It’s not just that the offering can
be suspended but also the
government might have just cause to
seek a criminal indictment

BRADLEE
Don’t be dramatic

IGNATIUS
What

FRITZ

A felon may not hold a broadcast
license which means they will
seize all of our broadcast
properties Without that revenue
we’ll be forced to sell If they
win and we are convicted then The
Washington Post Company will cease
to exist

BRADLEE
If we’re living in a world where
the government can tell you what to
print and broadcast then that
license doesn’t mean shit any way
FRITZ
That’s just -

IGNATIUS
How is this even a debate We can’t
possibly risk -

BRADLEE
If we don’t publish we’1ll be out
of business soon enough as it is

IGNATIUS
How -

BRADLEE
Because The New York Times will
win Maybe not tomorrow or next
week but gradually people will
stop thinking The Post has a leg to
stand on

FRITZ
Ben I understand that this might
be difficult to understand -

BRADLEE
Your patronizing tone aside this
isn’t -

IGNATIUS

This is about your ego Mr
Bradlee I truly don’t -

Bradlee tries to ignore Ignatius but it’s difficult

BRADLEE
Look I understand that the public
offering is important I understand
that being convicted felons isn’t
high on everyone’s list But in
this case it’s better than failure

IGNATIUS
You and I have very differing
opinions on failure

BRADLEE
(finally)
I’m not talking to you

Ignatius is taken aback He hates reporters

FRITZ
There will be other fights Other -

BRADLEE
You want to talk about a court
battle If they start fighting back
with freedom of the press - which
they absolutely will - and it comes
out that we had these documents and
didn’t publish them or stand with
The Times - at best we’ll look like
we’re scared At worst it’ll seem
like the government is telling us
what we can and can’t print

FRITZ
Publishing these documents could
destroy this paper

BRADLEE
There’s more than one way to do
that and you’re just letting them
have it We’re not even going to
push back a little What are you so
scared of

FRITZ
It’s my job to -

BRADLEE
It’s not your job It’s hers

He points to Kay They all look to her she seems tiny
compared to the three of them They wait for her to speak

Beat

Beat

KAY
It it is Mr Beebe’s job to -
BRADLEE

No It’s yours to make this
decision Just you

BRADLEE (CONTD)
You could’ve told me to get off the
story But you didn’t You could’ve
told me to not get the documents
But you didn’t

BRADLEE (CONTD)
And if The Post doesn’t publish
these papers you’ll have to find a
new executive editor tomorrow

FRITZ
(scowling)
Don’t be dramatic

Bradlee’s eyes don’t leave Kay’s

KAY
You’re willing to stand by that

BRADLEE
Absolutely

She thinks not taking this decision lightly

KAY
While you may feel responsible to
act as an exemplification for
freedom of the press Mr Bradlee
I have a commitment to the
thousands of people employed by
this company This isn’t their
crusade and I refuse to put them in
jeopardy over a vendetta

Bradlee is crest-fallen Ignatius heaves a sigh of relief
She looks to where her granddaughter spun in the sunshine
just days ago - lost in the memory for a moment Finally she
stands

KAY (CONT’D)
But -

Bradlee perks up

KAY (CONTD)

I also have a responsibility to the
public To the readers Even when
it might not support our own best
interests

(beat)
They lied All of them They lied
and told us that what we were doing
was good That we were helping
people who couldn’t help
themselves But that wasn’t it at
all No one wanted us there So
they we just sent a bunch of
young men to die It wasn’t just my
son or your son that they sent
over there And it shouldn’t just
be us to know the truth

She stands her ground Fritz can’t help but be moved Kay
looks to Bradlee softening

KAY (CONT’D)
They knew it was wrong Our our
friends knew And they didn’t care

Bradlee stares at her - the weight of it all hangs between
them She catches herself in the emotion straightens herself
back out

KAY (CONT’D)
Can you guarantee me that we can go
to print without publishing the
names of anyone in danger

BRADLEE

IGNATIUS
I can’t believe this

KAY
Mr Ignatius I’m -

IGNATIUS
You can’t be actually considering
this This is just your maternal -

KAY
Mr Ignatius -

Ignatius turns to Fritz
IGNATIUS
You’re just going to let her do
this She can’t possibly -
FRITZ
I assure you this is entirely Mrs

Graham’s decision

Ignatius stammers Kay hides a smile looking back to
Bradlee

BRADLEE
I give you my word

She thinks again then looks up at him

KAY
Do it Print them

She turns and walks back into the party going back to host
as if nothing happened Bradlee can hardly believe it

EXT NEWS STAND WASHINGTON DC - MORNING

Bradlee leans on a wall with a coffee and watches a POST
TRUCK deliver stacks of newspapers The early morning
COMMUTERS begin to grab them No one picks up The Times
Bradlee smiles and after a moment walks over and picks one
up himself He reads the front page “DOCUMENTS REVEAL US
EFFORT IN ‘54 TO DELAY VIET ELECTIONS - FIRST OF A SERIES BY
CHALMERS ROBERTS”

EXT VARIOUS WASHINGTON DC - MORNING

MEN and WOMEN young and old pick up copies of the
Washington Post They read it at NEWSTANDS and BARBER SHOPS
STUDENTS read it on CAMPUS There is an overwhelming feeling
of anger and disappointment in the faces of the readers

INT BULLPEN WASHINGTON POST - MORNING

The usual cacophony of typewriters and go-getters rushes
through the giant room Gene is in his office Howard sips
coffee - his eyes glued to the glass wall of Bradlee’s office
where Fritz Kay and Bradlee sit inside Meg approaches

MEG
They’re going to catch you staring
HOWARD
Then he shouldn’t have made it a
glass wall
MEG

(smiling)
Chalmers onto the next piece

HOWARD
(nodding)
He’s got Murrey working on one too

MEG
Think we’ll get to print them

HOWARD

(shrugging)
I’m shocked she let us get one in

INT BRADLEE’S OFFICE WASHINGTON POST - SAME TIME

An awkward silence hangs between Bradlee Kay and Fritz -
who has a legal pad on his lap

BRADLEE
You’re sure they’re going to call

FRITZ
Yes

BRADLEE
I met the AAG once Tiny hands

Kay hides a smile After a few moments of unbearable
silence the phone at Cynthia’s desk rings After a moment -

CYNTHIA (0S)
It’s the Assistant Attorney
General

BRADLEE
Put him through

Bradlee takes a deep breath Kay doesn’t know what to expect
Bradlee’s phone rings and he puts it on speaker

BRADLEE (CONT’D)
This is Bradlee I have Mrs Graham
and Mr Beebe here with me

BALILES (0S)
Good morning this is Assistant
Attorney General Gerald Baliles

BRADLEE
Hello Mr Baliles

Fritz begins making notes

BALILES
(rote)

Mr Bradlee I have been advised by
the Secretary of Defense that the
material published in The
Washington Post this morning
contains information relating to
the national defense of the United
States and bears a top-secret
classification

(MORE )

BALILES (CONTD)
As such the publication of this
information is directly prohibited
by the provision of the Espionage
Law Title 18 United States Code
Section 793

Fritz closes his eyes tight Kay and Bradlee exchange a
glance

BALILES (0S) (CONT’D)
Moreover further publication will
cause irreparable injury to the
defense interest of the United
States Accordingly I respectfully
request that you publish no further
information of this character and
advise me that you have made
arrangements for the return of
these documents to the Department
of Defense

Bradlee looks to Fritz who gives him another nod of the head

BRADLEE
Thank you for the call Mr
Baliles but we respectfully
decline

BALILES (0S)
Thank you for your time

The call ends The moment hangs there briefly

KAY
What’s next

Fritz sighs and stands

FRITZ
We’re going to court Today
They’1l try and prove we knowingly
published something that was a
danger to the US government

BRADLEE
Did he call us spies

FRITZ
Not as glamorous as you thought is
it
(beat)
I’1l1 call when I have more news
For now keep them writing
(MORE )
FRITZ (CONTD)
We’ve opened the door No reason
closing it until they order us to

KAY
Will it come to that

FRITZ
Most assuredly
(to Bradlee)
You wanted a fight

Fritz leaves she looks at Bradlee

KAY
Mr Bradlee

BRADLEE
(in a daze)
Hm

KAY
When was the last time you slept

BRADLEE
The day before I started this job

Beat Bradlee wonders why she’s still there

BRADLEE (CONT’D)
Mrs Graham

KAY
I spoke to Mr McNamara

BRADLEE
(surprised)
What You - will he -

KAY
He’s not a villain

BRADLEE
You don’t have to be a villain to
do villainous things

KAY
He won’t be a source for you

BRADLEE
(frustrated)
Mrs Graham -

KAY
(standing)
I think I’1l go with Fritz to the
hearing

BRADLEE
They probably won’t let you in Why
did you tell me if you’re not going
to let me -

KAY
Because I didn’t want you to think
I was afraid to ask

He’s stunned by this A moment hangs between them

KAY (CONTD)
I’1ll keep you informed

He nods and she leaves He looks out to the bullpen and
watches his staff their never-ending hustle

INT COURTHOUSE - NIGHT

Kay paces outside of a courtroom - a closed hearing taking
place She’s alone walking up and down the hallway her
heels echoing off the walls A YOUNG WOMAN (late 20s) hurries
down the hallway part walkpart run She’s about to open the
door to the courtroom -

KAY
I wouldn’t do that It’s a closed
hearing

YOUNG WOMAN
Shoot Have they been in there for
long

KAY
(checking her watch)
A few hours

YOUNG WOMAN
Shoot shoot

She presses her ear to the door Kay watches her from the
corner of her eye Finally the young woman sits

YOUNG WOMAN (CONT’D)
I was supposed to bring something
to my boss but I had to finish up a
few things and there was so much
traffic and I - well - you just
wouldn’t think - at this time of
night

Kay nods once trying not to get involved A moment passes
They woman gives Kay a once over

YOUNG WOMAN (CONT’D)
Are you Mrs Graham

KAY
(forcing a smile)
I think we’re supposed to keep our
voices down

The young woman nods Another moment passes

YOUNG WOMAN
Chushed)
I’m probably not supposed to say
this but I hope you win

Kay looks at her a strange expression on her face

YOUNG WOMAN (CONT’D)
I mean I think what you’re doing -
printing those papers - I think
it’s right It’s the right thing to
do

Kay nods once The woman waits a minute but can’t help
herself -

YOUNG WOMAN (CONT’D)
I read that interview you did and -
I know people been giving you a
hard time but - I think you gotta
just ignore them It’s not easy
being the only one of us in a room
with a bunch of them

She gestures her head towards the door

YOUNG WOMAN (CONTD)
Sometimes people don’t appreciate
how much you’re doing until you’ve
already done it And I like seeing
someone tell these guys what’s
what

(MORE )

YOUNG WOMAN (CONTD)
But don’t tell my boss I said that -
he’d fire me just for talking to
you

KAY
Let’s not have that happen

The woman nods and goes back to sitting there in silence Kay
realizes she might have been rude

KAY (CONT’D)
Thank you

The woman offers a friendly smile JUST as the doors to the
courtroom open Kay stands Fritz walks over - there’s a
frenzy coming from all the lawyers as they spill out

KAY (CONTD)
Well

FRITZ
They’re issuing a restraining order
until we can get back in to see the

judge
KAY
Tonight
FRITZ
(tired)

Monday And if that doesn’t work
for them we’ll head to the Supreme
Court of Appeals

KAY
(angry)
We can’t print anything
FRITZ
Not after tonight But it’s not

over yet
Kay watches behind Fritz as the young woman is berated by a
GOVERNMENT LAWYER
INT LIVING ROOM BRADLEE HOUSE - NIGHT
Bradlee walks in disheveled exhausted He drops his

briefcase on the ground and stands there for a moment
Enjoying the quiet He hears the faint sound of a TV

INT DEN BRADLEE HOUSE - NIGHT

Marina is asleep in front of the TV He smiles He moves to
turn it off but sees that it’s special news program on
Vietnam produced by ECO He sits for a minute

NEWSREEL
“ The truth of the matter is
the Paris Peace Talks hailed as a
major breakthrough in 1968 have by
1971 achieved nothing The
delegates still turn up make
accusatory speeches and leave Week
in week out the delegates play
their parts but its all become a
puppet show without an audience
And in the meantime the war goes
on and the casualty lists mount”

Bradlee grits his jaw as he watches

INT STUDIO BRADLEE HOUSE - A LITTLE LATER

Tony sits on a stool painting in splattered overalls A
record player plays softly a cigarette smokes in an ashtray
Bradlee walks towards the studio with a beer Eventually he
leans on the doorway She knows he’s there but she doesn’t
need to acknowledge it

BRADLEE
I thought that one was finished

TONY
Youre thinking of a different one

BRADLEE
Oh

Their conversation is slow At ease He walks to the worn-out
recliner he sat in for many nights in the early days of their
marriage Now it’s cluttered with papers He moves them off
and sits

BRADLEE (CONTD)
Your daughter snuck down to watch
TV again

She looks at him

TONY
You look terrible

BRADLEE
(smiling)
So I’ve been told

He watches her paint The sounds from the record playing in
between them

BRADLEE (CONTD)
Fritz thinks it’s going to go to
the Supreme Court

TONY
That’s what you wanted right

BRADLEE
Yea I -
He trails off
TONY
What
BRADLEE

I think I messed this one up

TONY
Just because you might not win
doesn’t mean you messed up Not
everything is supposed to go your

way Ben
BRADLEE
I know
TONY
Do you
Maybe he doesn’t
BRADLEE
If this goes bad they’re going to
put the blame on me I guess I

just don’t know if it was worth it

TONY
Don’t be an idiot Bradlee

He stares at her

TONY (CONTD)
Yea maybe you won’t win Maybe
youll have to resign and start all
over again But you did the right
thing That’s worth it

(MORE)

TONY (CONTD)
Besides you asked for the blame in
the first place You can’t put that
on anyone else now that you’re up
shit’s creek

BRADLEE
(smiling)
You sure know how to cut to the
quick

TONY
Of course It’s why you married me

BRADLEE
Ah is that why I keep forgetting

It’s a joke but there’s some truth to it He watches her
again - lost in thought

BRADLEE (CONT’D)
What do you think of her

TONY
Who Our daughter

BRADLEE
(laughing)
No Mrs Graham

TONY
I don’t know her

BRADLEE
That’s never stopped you from
having an opinion before

She takes her time with it turning to look at him

TONY
I think she’s in a position she
never thought she’d have and I’m
sure plenty of people don’t think
she should be in If I were her
I wouldn’t even know where to
start

INT BOARDROOM WASHINGTON POST - MORNING

Copies of The Washington Post are dropped Each headline
details the progress that’s been made on the case “GESELL
UPHOLDS PREVIOUS RULING IN ‘PENTAGON PAPERS’ CASE APPEAL
HEADED TO FEDERAL COURT” “COURT FINDS IN FAVOR OF POST
RESTRAINING ORDER UPHELD” “TIMES AND POST CASES ENJOINED
CASE HEADED TO SUPREME COURT” “SUPREME COURT HEARING ON
‘PENTAGON PAPERS’ SET FOR EMERGENCY SATURDAY HEARING”

IGNATIUS slams each paper onto the table Kay watches
patiently from her normal seat Fritz looks on The past week
has taken a toll They look exhausted

IGNATIUS
And now our IPO is being
reconsidered

A murmur amongst the board members

FRITZ
They’re just doing their due
diligence This is a big offering

IGNATIUS
Due diligence

FRITZ
Yes Paul And what is it -

IGNATIUS
Please don’t ask what I’m
insinuating I think it’s clear
ever since Mrs Graham took over we
have seen not only a steady decline
in profits but now a jump off the
cliff

Kay lets it happen - but she’s not happy about it

IGNATIUS (CONT’D)
I was brought here because of my
experience and never have I seen
such a disregard for the best
intentions of a company If I offer
my opinion and it is ignored once
Ill let it go Twice I’1ll raise
my hand Three times - I must
speak If no one else will I will
stand up for the interests of our
Board

That’s a dagger to Kay’s heart Fritz surveys the room he
can’t tell whose side the boardmembers are on
She stands

herself

IGNATIUS (CONT’D)
Mrs Graham your decision to allow
The Post to become involved in this
crusade is beyond reprehensible
You’ve repeatedly allowed Mr
Bradlee and his - group - to have
his way with this paper Through
weak and misguided leadership And
frankly it is something I am sure
that neither your father nor your
husband -

KAY
That will be quite enough It is
perfectly clear Mr Ignatius that
you and I have very different
opinions of how to run this
company However whether you agree
with my decisions or not I have
made them Not you

Ignatius is almost red with anger

She leaves the room

KAY (CONTD)

If it is your intention to bully me
into leaving this company I assure
you - that is not going to happen
If you truly believe that the
correct step is for me to step
down please - take a vote But I
recommend you do it after the
hearing tomorrow You may not think
I know much but I can tell you
your headline will sell much better
if you fire a felon Not just a
woman

(beat)
And I hate to disappoint you Mr
Ignatius but Phil Graham never
cared for bullies and he wouldn’t
have cared for you

INT GENE’S OFFICE WASHINGTON POST - DAY

Bradlee knocks Gene looks up

BRADLEE
You got a minute

surprising everyone - not the least of which

emboldened The boardmembers shocked
GENE
Sure

Bradlee walks in and shuts the door behind him

BRADLEE
You coming to the hearing tomorrow

GENE
I think I should probably stay
here In case the world decides to
keep rotating while you’re all in
court

Bradlee laughs once

GENE (CONT’D)
You alright

BRADLEE
No I - I need to ask a favor
GENE
(joking)

Hang on let me write this down
Bradlee’s mood is serious Gene’s expression changes

GENE (CONTD)
Jesus Ben What

BRADLEE
If this thing goes bad Which I
don’t know I thought it would be
over by now and it’s not so -

GENE
They’re just -

BRADLEE
When Fritz Beebe tells you it
doesn’t look good it doesn’t do
much to bolster confidence
(beat)
If I have to resign if it comes to
that I need you to stay

Gene is stunned A moment hangs between them
GENE

Well that’s about the last thing I
ever thought I’d hear

BRADLEE
Howard’s going to want the job and
if I’m here he’ll get it But if
things go south and I have to leave
- I need you to be here They’1l
listen to you and I - look I may
not have done a lot around here
but I assembled a great
newsroom I need you to keep them
together for as long as you can

Gene thinks a minute

GENE
(quiet)
Alright

Bradlee stands and offers his hand Gene rises and takes it

BRADLEE
Thanks

GENE
But if this goes your way I’m still
getting the hell out of here

BRADLEE
(smiling)
Id expect nothing less

INT KITCHEN GRAHAM HOUSE - NIGHT

Kay sits at the table writing in a notepad she keeps
scribbling things out Frustrated A half-empty glass of wine
next to her She hears the front door open and turns to look
concerned Lally walks in looking exhausted Solemn

KAY
(concerned)
Lally
LALLY

I’m sorry I didn’t call
She sits across from her mother

KAY
(carefully)
Is everything OK Where’s
Katharine

LALLY
With Yann I just I needed to
get away for a bit

Kay goes to the cabinet and gets a glass for Lally Then
pours a hefty one surprising her daughter Lally looks at
the notepad confused -

LALLY (CONTD)
What’re you -

It dawns on her

LALLY (CONT’D)
The case - I didn’t -

KAY
It’s alright I’m not getting
anywhere

LALLY

You have to make a statement

KAY
Fritz thinks it would be best

LALLY
Can I help

KAY
Oh no Honestly I’m not even quite
sure where to begin

LALLY
I’m sorry - I should’ve called -

Kay waves her hand to stop her

KAY
Growing up we always had to be
scarce Out of sight and all I
never wanted that for my children
but - now Well It’s quiet again

LALLY
We should visit more

KAY
(shaking her head)
I raised you to have your own
lives It would be hypocritical of
me to ask for them back
LALLY
No it wouldn’t You’re allowed to
ask for things Mom

KAY
I know that

LALLY
Do you Sometimes I feel like you
don’t speak up because I don’t

know You’re afraid you’1l sound -

KAY
That’s not fair When -

LALLY
Fair or not it’s the truth

KAY
My children always think they know
everything

Lally watches her mother with interest

KAY (CONT’D)
People thought I must have been
devastated when your grandfather
picked your father to run the
company instead of me

LALLY
Weren’t you

KAY
No I was proud Your father was
the smartest man I’d ever met When
your grandfather chose him it was
like well it was like he chose
me Because Phil had been my
choice

LALLY
But He didn’t choose you

KAY
It’s different for you Your
generation - women can get away
with having expectations -

LALLY
No we can’t But we do it because
if we don’t well No one’s going

to do it for us

Kay watches her daughter

LALLY (CONT’D)
I grew up in this house too Mom

Dad was smart but you you’re the
one that kept it all together
(beat)

Grandpa was wrong
Kay looks down at her notepad

KAY
I keep wandering into your father’s
office Hoping that Ill find
something new there A journal or a
letter - telling me what I’m
supposed to do next What steps to
take - If I made the right ones

LALLY
(soft)
This isn’t about Dad Or Grandpa
This is about you And you’ve
already done the hardest part - now
you just have to stand by it

KAY
You say it as if it’s so simple

LALLY
I know everything remember

INT COURTROOM SUPREME COURT BUILDING - DAY

The courtroom is packed the NINE JUSTICES (all men 40s-
60s) sit in their leather chairs and listen to the arguments
There are three sets of lawyers the government (GRISWOLD
40s) the Post and the Times At the moment Griswold is at
the lectern

Kay is in a pew directly behind Fritz next to Lally
Ignatius is nearby Bradlee a few behind her next to Howard
He’s nervous foot tapping on the ground The doors open and
Bagdikian sneaks in taking a seat next to Meg

BAGDIKIAN
Chushed)
You see how many people are
outside

MEG
(sotto)
I’ve been here for the last four
hours

GRISWOLD
» We also contend that the
publishing of these documents is a
dishonorable and treasonous act
that will dramatically undermine
the President’s power to conduct
foreign affairs and in authority as
Commander-in-Chief of the Armed
Forces

Bradlee and Kay both wince at Griswold’s use of
“dishonorable”

GRISWOLD (CONTD)
As the scope of these documents is
so vast it’s hard to fully warn
against the consequences of them
being made public To print these
papers without consulting the
government is to exercise a
criminal disregard for the safety
of this country and our troops
overseas

Griswold closes his folder and takes his seat

JUDGE BLACK
Thank you Mr Griswold Now I
understand that Mrs Katharine
Graham will be making a statement

Bradlee is surprised She rises and walks to the lectern

KAY
Thank you Judge Black

She takes a breath steeling herself

KAY (CONTD)
As you said my name is Katharine
Graham and I am the owner and
publisher of the Washington Post
(beat)
I’ve been in the newspaper business
almost my whole life My father
purchased the paper when I was
sixteen and - well - all I ever
wanted to do was work at it It
(MORE)

KAY (CONTD)
took me a little longer than I
thought it would but well
sometimes things happen as they
should I think

The crowd is rapt with interest

KAY (CONTD)
As I said I’ve been in this
business nearly my whole life and
never never have I seen a story
that displays such a wanton
disregard for the public interest
To have hidden these decisions made
without the people’s knowledge that
resulted in decades of torture
murder and oppression

Bradlee is stunned by the power of her words

KAY (CONTD)
My father when he stepped down
issued a press release He said
“The citizens of a free country
have to depend on a free press for
the information necessary to the
intelligent discharge of their
duties of citizenship That is why
the Constitution gives newspapers
express protection from Government
interference” It it might have
taken me a little while longer than
my father would’ve hoped to truly
understand these words but I
believe them to be true It is my
responsibility to stand behind my
staff and the truth of their
convictions to tell this story It
is our duty

Meg and Howard are rapt with attention A shock to them both

KAY (CONTD)
This paper has been in my life
longer than most of my staff has
been alive And the legacy it
carries is not just my name but my
father’s name My husband’s name
And my decision to publish these
papers is one that could put into
jeopardy the lot of it

She almost looks back at Bradlee but keeps her eyes forward

KAY (CONTD)
However if the decision is made by
the courts to side with the
government and the Washington Post
ceases to exist I can think of no
stronger mark to leave than by
taking a stand for what is right
And there will have been no greater
honor in my life than to be beside
the men and women of the Post while
we attempt to do just that

Her voice shakes Bradlee’s eyes are glassy but he covers

KAY (CONT’D)
Thank you

She steps back to her seat she and Bradlee avoid eye
contact Lally beams with pride

JUDGE BLACK
Thank you Mrs Graham

INT HALLWAY COURTHOUSE - A LITTLE LATER

The attendees file out Bradlee stands with Meg and Howard
He keeps his eyes aloft looking for Kay not paying
attention to their conversation He can’t find her Bagdikian
jogs towards them from outside

BAGDIKIAN
There’s something you gotta see

Bradlee looks around one last time to find Kay but if she’s
there she’s lost in the sea of people He follows the trio
to the door

EXT SUPREME COURT WASHINGTON DC - MOMENTS LATER

Bradlee Meg Bagdikian and Howard step out onto the iconic
front steps to see a PEACE RALLY taking place Thousands of
people PICKETS in the air plastered with messages like “NO
MORE LIES” “BRING OUR BOYS BACK” and “VETERANS FOR PEACE”
Meg smiles and pats Bradlee on the back He stands there
hands in pockets watching everything that’s taken place

EXT SUPREME COURT WASHINGTON DC - EARLY MORNING
Kay sits on a bench outside of the courtroom Her ankles

crossed posture perfect there is an unreadable look on her
face Fritz walks over

FRITZ
Shouldn’t be much longer

She nods he goes back to the attorneys She seems to be ina
bit of a daze trying to wrap her head around the magnitude
of it all The sound of shuffling feet knocks her from her
thoughts She turns surprised to see Bradlee straightening
his tie and rushing towards her He sits

BRADLEE
The verdict in yet

KAY
I don’t think so

He relaxes into the bench She studies him he finally looks
at her

BRADLEE
You didn’t think I’d leave you here
with the suits

KAY
Ima “suit”
BRADLEE
Mrs Graham you are much more than

that

The faintest of smiles appears for a moment on her face She
sits back in the bench After a beat -

BRADLEE (CONT’D)
About yesterday -

KAY
Did you ever see The Vagabond King

BRADLEE
The one with Rita Moreno

KAY
My father took me to see it when it
was on Broadway I was just a
little girl but I remember being so
excited that he picked me to go
with him Not everyone Just me

BRADLEE
He liked you

KAY
There’s a scene I’ve been thinking
about quite a lot lately

(MORE )

KAY (CONTD)
Since Phil died really At the
end when the King appears in royal
garb walking down those steps for
the first time All the archers
have their arrows pointed at him
ready to release at any moment -
deciding what to do - deciding
if he is worthy enough to wear
those robes

She trails off into the memory choosing to keep the
intention of the story private He watches her then -

BRADLEE
I’m sorry

She looks at him surprised

KAY

For what
BRADLEE

For well Not trusting you
KAY

(conspiratorial grin)
I didn’t trust you the whole time
either Mr Bradlee

BRADLEE
Still I was wrong

After a moment she nods ever so slightly

KAY
Being the victim doesn’t really
suit me All it does is open a door
for more people to judge you
Criticize you And I guess one
day you have to just decide not to
allow them to do that anymore

BRADLEE
Would love to know how you did
that

KAY

Sometimes in life you don’t really
decide to move on you just do
Blindly and mindlessly

BRADLEE
Blindly and mindlessly I like
that

Next to them the doors to the courtroom open and Fritz turns
to give Kay a nod She stands nervously smoothing her dress
She walks into the courtroom first followed closely behind
by Bradlee The doors shut

INT BRADLEE’S OFFICE WASHINGTON POST - THE NEXT DAY

The front page of the Washington Post sits on his desk The
headline reads “SUPREME COURT RULES IN FAVOR OF PAPERS”

Bradlee looks at the famous photo of he and Kay on the steps
of the courthouse celebrating their victory a smile of
pride on his face He tears it from the rest of the paper
Cynthia walks in

CYNTHIA
We can have an actual photo framed
for you y’know

BRADLEE
I like this one Did you reach Mrs
Graham for me

CYNTHIA
I left word

He writes on the photo “Wear the robes - B” then hands it to
Cynthia She looks at it confused

BRADLEE
Make sure that gets to her desk

She nods and he rises walking to the bullpen

INT BULLPEN WASHINGTON POST - CONTINUOUS

He walks to the center of the room his back to the
elevators

BRADLEE
Hey Can I have everyone’s
attention for a minute

The staff turns Gene steps out of his office and into the
doorway Meg Howard Bagdikian and Geyelin all listen from
various parts of the newsroom

BRADLEE (CONTD)
This is going to be quick because
it takes an act of God for any of
you to hit a deadline even without
an interruption

Laughs from the crowd

BRADLEE (CONTD)
I just wanted to say thank you I -
you know - I don’t say it enough
but The guts The energy and of
everyone involved in this and
well - it has impressed me more
than anything You were all
beautiful

Behind him Kay steps off the elevator He doesn’t see her
but others do Bradlee’s voice shakes slightly

BRADLEE (CONTD)
To have been able to work beside
you all to work with our publisher
who saw through the fear of
retribution Who saw the need to
bring it all to light To echo Mrs
Graham’s words - to have been a
part of that is one of the greatest
honors of this newsman’s life

There’s a split second of awkwardness as no one knows what to
do with such a level of sincerity from him Finally Howard
begins to clap The room applauds and cheers after a minute
he waves his hands -

BRADLEE (CONT’D)
Alright Enough To work

They all listen and get to it Bradlee makes eye contact with
Gene who offers a slight nod of the head before going into
his office Bradlee turns to see Kay walking in his
direction He forces a smile slightly embarrassed Kay
approaches Bradlee There’s a moment hanging between them

KAY
Would you have really resigned

He shrugs

PHIL
Do you think Phil would have
published the Papers

After a moment That conspiratorial grin again -

KAY
Not in a million years

He laughs and they begin to walk towards his office
KAY (CONTD)
If now is alright I was hoping we
could discuss the Style section

He starts to laugh then realizes -

BRADLEE
You’re serious

KAY
We can’t sit around in
sentimentality all day

BRADLEE
I’m not getting into this with you
again

KAY
Then it appears we are at an
impasse

BRADLEE
That’s one word for it

KAY
I’m not saying it’s entirely wrong

but the section it - it just
doesn’t make sense to me

BRADLEE
It’s not meant for you

KAY
Who’s it meant for

BRADLEE
(annoyed )
We’ve discussed this
KAY
I think it deserves just another
conversation -
BRADLEE
The Times -
KAY

Not with The Times again -

They walk into Bradlee’s office where we stay outside in the
bullpen and watch through the glass Bradlee sits stubborn
and headstrong feet on the desk and arms in the air out of
exasperation Kay seated across from him thoughtful but
equally stubborn politely making her point
