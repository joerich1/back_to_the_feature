FIRST DRAFT

HAZEL GRACE LANCASTER lies in the grass staring up at
the stars Were CLOSE ON her FACE and we hear

HAZEL (VO)

You have a choice in this world I
believe about how to tell sad
stories

CUT TO a SERIES OF QUICK IMAGES

- Hazel and the BOY we will come to know as AUGUSTUS GUS
WATERS at an outdoor restaurant in some magical place
They look very much like the perfect Hollywood couple

HAZEL (VO)

On the one hand you can sugar coat
- the way they do in movies and
romance novels

- Perfect Hazel and Perfect Gus sit on a BENCH
overlooking an incredible seascape in some foreign country
She rests her head on his shoulder

HAZEL (VO)

Where villains are vanquished

and heroes are born and

- Perfect Hazel and Perfect Gus kiss in a dark room
together

saw

the

HAZEL (VO)
beautiful people learn
beautiful lessons

- Perfect Hazel and Perfect Gus fall onto a bed
They look deep into one anothers eyes

HAZEL (VO)

and nothing is too messed up
that cant be fixed with an apology
and a Peter Gabriel song

BACK TO Hazel on the grass still watching the stars
those dreams or were they memories Still unclear

HAZEL (VO)

I like that way as much as the next
girl believe me Its just not the
truth

Hazel closes her eyes

HAZEL (VO)

This is the truth

And EVERYTHING GOES BLACK We HEAR

HAZEL (VO)
Sorry

The real Hazel is no less beautiful than the one we just

HAZEL (VO)
Late in the Winter of my 17th
year

There are however some key and obvious differences

First youll notice the OXYGEN TUBE in her nostrils which

help her to breathe

Second youll notice her hair - which we couldnt see in

grass Its much shorter than the Perfect version

the

result of someone whose head was completely shaved a few
years before

HAZEL (VO)
my mother decided I was
depressed

HAZEL
Im not depressed

Hazels legs dangle over the side of an exam table Her
mother FRANNIE (early 40s younger than she feels) explains
to the DOCTOR

barely leaves the house

HAZEL
Im not depressed

FRANNIE

and over

DOCTOR

HAZEL (VO)
The booklets and web sites always
list depression as a side effect of
cancer

- A SHOPPING MALL Filled with TEENAGE GIRLS - gossipping
laughing - being teenage girls basically And heres Hazel

HAZEL (VO)
Depressions not a side effect of
cancer

- HAZELS LIVING ROOM She sits watching game shows in the
middle of the afternoon Her Mom brings her a sandwich A
glass of water And then a whole host of prescription meds
Hazel eyes them with indifference

HAZEL (VO)
its a side effect of dying

- A STARBUCKS Hazel sits alone reading a dog-eared heavily
underlined copy of a novel (An Imperial Affliction by

Peter

Van Houten) She only looks up when distracted by a squeal
of

delight A YOUNG GUY has lifted a YOUNG GIRL over his

shoulder playfully He spins her around Hazel watches a
beat

The only thing worse than biting it

As Frannie gets back in the car she shouts to her daughter

FRANNIE
Make some friends
Hazel just shakes her head CUT TO

INT CHURCH - SAME
Hazel walks towards the elevator An EXTREMELY SICK LOOKING
KID holds it open for her Hazel thinks better of it

HAZEL
Ill take the stairs
The KID nods The doors shut Hazel is reminded - it could
always be worse She turns to go walking right into

GUS HAZEL
Ooph Sorry

A SUPREMELY BEAUTIFUL BOY (we will come to know him as GUS)
Tall lean muscular straight short mahogany hair blue
eyes Hazel has never seen a better looking kid in her life

GUS HAZEL
My bad No its

For a brief moment the Earth stops They stand looking at
one another Hazel is speechless

HAZEL

Excuse me
With the Beautiful Boy watching a wan smile on his face
Hazel shuffles off as fast as she can ducking into

INT BATHROOM - SAME

Hazel catches her breath Shakes her head Surprised at
herself

She looks in the mirror So doesnt like what she sees The
Earth starts moving again CUT TO

INT CHURCH BASEMENT - LATER
Hazel sits in the Circle of Sick

PATRICK
Who would like to begin

No volunteers Hazel catches sight of the Beautiful Boy

sitting next to Isaac He seems to be watching her that
same

flirty smile on his face She self-consciously looks away

PATRICK
Isaac I know youre facing a
challenging time Perhaps you would
like to say something
Isaac nods rises

ISAAC
Yeah um Im Isaac 17 Eye
cancer

(BEAT)

Its looking like another surgery

in a couple weeks After which

well Ill be blind
Hazel tries to focus on what Isaacs saying but its
difficult She still feels the Beautiful Boys gaze on her

ISAAC

Not that Im complaining or

anything I know a lot of you have

it way worse but still I mean

you know being blinds gonna

suck
As Isaac shares the Beautiful Boy doesnt look away from
Hazel Hazel finds this intimidating And intimidation
irritates her So she decides to play the game with him
meeting his gaze and holding it just as firmly
A staring contest

ISAAC
-My girlfriend helps And friends
like Augustus here
Isaac nods towards the Beautiful Boy who now has a name -
AUGUSTUS He still doesnt look away from Hazel

ISAAC
So yeah Thats whats up

ALL IN UNISON
Were here for you Isaac
The staring contest continues another few beats until
PATRICK
And does your friend want to speak
This causes the Beautiful Boy to momentarily look away Aha
hes lost the contest Hazel smiles flicks her eyebrows up
as if to say Victory is mine He smiles back at her the
most radiant smile on the planet He turns back to the
Group

GUS
Hi Im Augustus Waters 17 Hada
touch of osteosarcoma bout a year
and a half ago - lost this baby as
a result

Gus holds up his right leg - a prosthetic

GUS
But really Im just here at Isaacs
request

PATRICK

And how are you feeling Augustus

GUS
Me Oh Im grand Im on a roller
coaster that only goes up my
friend
Hazel smiles Gus catches this Embarrassed she stops
smiling and looks away

PATRICK
Perhaps youd like to share your
fears with the group Augustus

GUS
My fears
Gus thinks about this

GUS
Oblivion

PATRICK
Oblivion
ANGLE ON Hazel intrigued

GUS
Yeah see I intend to live an
extraordinary life To be
remembered If Im scared of
anything its not doing that
Patrick doesnt quite have the tools to deal with that

PATRICK
Would uh anyone like to speak to
that
And Hazels hand goes up Even Patrick is surprised by that

PATRICK
Hazel Thats unexpected
Hazel stands takes a second to gather her thoughts
Augustus
watches her waits for it

HAZEL
I just wanna say there will come
a time when you know all of us
are dead
Gus is now even more fixed on her than before

HAZEL

It might be tomorrow Might be a
million years from now but its
gonna happen And when it does
enough generations will come and

go therell be no one left to
remember Cleopatra Or Mozart Or
Muhammad Ali let alone any of us
right
The look on Guss face is unreadable

HAZEL
Oblivions inevitable And if that
scares you well I suggest you
ignore it God knows its what
everyone else does
A beat And then an enormous smile spreads across Guss
face
not a flirty smile but a surprised one a real one CUT TO

EXT OUTSIDE THE CHURCH - LATER

Hazel waits for her Moms car to appear

Across the parking lot she sees Isaac going at it with a
redhead MONICA sucking face like theres no tomorrow
against the door of her green Pontiac Firebird Between
kisses we can hear
ISAAC MONICA
Always Always

And Hazel hears

GUS
Literally
Hazel turns to find the Beautiful Boy Augustus
right next to her

GUS
I thought we were in a church
basement but apparently we were
literally in the heart of Jesus
Hazel smiles

HAZEL
Someone should probably tell him
dont you think Jesus Seems kinda
dangerous keeping all these kids
with cancer in your heart
Gus laughs

GUS
Whats your name

HAZEL
Hazel

GUS
No your full name

HAZEL

(CONFUSED)
Hazel Grace Lancaster

standing

Gus nods to himself smiles Still fixated on her

HAZEL
What

GUS
I didnt say anything

HAZEL
Why are you looking at me like
that

GUS
Because youre beautiful
Hazel is taken aback No ones ever said that to her before

GUS
I enjoy looking at beautiful people
and I decided a while back not to
deny myself the simpler pleasures
of existence Particularly given
that as you so astutely pointed
out were all gonna die pretty
soon

HAZEL

(BEAT)
Im not beaut --
A CUTE YOUNG GIRL walks past them

YOUNG GIRL
Hey Gus

GUS
Hey Alisa
Hazel isnt surprised that other girls know Gus Of course
they do She turns back towards Isaac and Monica pawing at
each other She hears

ISAAC MONICA

HAZEL
Whats with the always

GUS

Always is their thing Theyll

always love each other and

whatnot Must have texted always

to each other at least four million

times this year
They continue to watch the show Its pretty gross Isaac
squeezes Monicas breast like a clown horn
HAZEL
Hes gotta be hurting her boob

Gus

Hazel is again surprised

HAZEL
Oh Um Uh

WEEK--â€”
GUS
No I mean now
HAZEL

GUS
Hmm
HAZEL

What do you mean now

GUS
Ive got a car
He shrugs Hazel has never seen someone so confident

HAZEL
You could be an axe murderer

GUS
There is that possibility

(BEAT)
Come on Hazel Grace take a risk
As Hazel mulls this over Gus reaches into his pocket and
pulls out of all things a pack of cigarettes Hazel is in
disbelief He flips the box open puts a cigarette between
his lips

HAZEL
Oh my god Oh My God Youre
kidding right
(off his look)
You just ruined the whole thing

on

GUS
Whole thing

HAZEL
What you think thats cool Oh you
idiot Theres always a hamartia
isnt there And yours is - even
though you had FREAKING CANCER you
give money to a corporation for the
chance to acquire EVEN MORE
CANCER Ugh And you were doing so
well
As she rants Gus continues to look at her with that smile

his face Hazel does not find it so amusing

HAZEL
Let me tell you not being able
to breathe Sucks Totally sucks

GUS
Hamartia
Hazel folds her arms and turns away from him

HAZEL
A fatal flaw
Gus takes a beat and then moves to face her the smile still
etched on his face

GUS
They dont hurt you unless you
light them

HAZEL
Sorry

GUS

Ive never lit one
Hazel turns back to him

GUS
Its a metaphor See You put the
thing that kills you between your
teeth But you dont give it the
power to do the killing
Hazel is floored And impressed

HAZEL
Metaphor
Gus holds her gaze And its at this point Frannie pulls up
as

FRANNIE
Hi sweetheart Ready for some
Model

Hazel looks at Gus cigarette dangling from his lips Cool
anything Handsome as hell She looks back at her mom

HAZEL

Cant tonight

(off her confused look)

Ive made plans with Augustus

Waters
And with that she walks off Frannie looks at the boy with
the cigarette in his mouth This could be trouble Or
awesome Or both And we CUT TO

INT GUSS CAR - LATER

Hazel is terrified Turns out Gus is the worlds worst
driver When he brakes her body flies forward against the
seatbelt And when he hits the gas seconds later her neck
snaps back in the seat Gus sees the look on her face

GUS
I failed the test a couple times

HAZEL
You dont say
GUS
Most amputees can drive with no
problem but yeah Not me
HAZEL

Im surprised you have a license

GUS
Tell me about it
Another brake forces Hazel against the seat belt

GUS
The fourth time I took the test
it was going about how this is
going and when it was over the
instructor looks at me and goes
your driving while unpleasant
is not technically unsafe

HAZEL
Aha Cancer perk

GUS
Total cancer perk
A few beats of silence

GUS
So what happened to you
Hazel takes a deep breath Shes told this story before but
somehow this seems different

HAZEL
I was 13 when they found it
And as she speaks we see it unfold SMASH CUT TO

INT HOSPITAL BED - FLASHBACK
13-YEAR OLD HAZEL has a biopsy

HAZEL (VO)

Then Chemo
- With a PICC line in a chemo chair
HAZEL (VO)
All of which worked for a while
- A RADIOLOGIST looks at an X-ray Hes not pleased

HAZEL (VO)

And then stopped working

- 14-Year Old Hazel lies in bed struggling to breathe
Frannie runs her fingers through her hair Dad calls 9-1-1

HAZEL (VO)

And then my lungs started filling

up with water

- In the ICU her parents standing over her

HAZEL (VO)
That should have been the end

FRANNIE
(through the tears)
Are you ready sweetie
14-Year Old Hazel nods Michael cant keep it together any
longer He completely breaks down

HAZEL (VO)
But it wasnt

INT ICU - THE NEXT MORNING

The sun shines in the room 14-year old Hazel eats ice
chips

the color has returned to her cheeks

HAZEL (VO)

The antibiotics kicked in They
drained the fluid from my lungs
And in time I got better Stronger

INT YET ANOTHER HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY
Slightly older Hazel is getting more intravenous medication
Its never ending

HAZEL (VO)
I even found myself in an
experimental trial You know the
ones that are famous in the

Republic of Cancervania for not

working

- A SECOND RADIOLOGIST examines a second X-ray

HAZEL (VO)

Its called Phalanxifor Didnt
work in over 70 percent of patients
but for some reason
The Radiologist looks surprised

HAZEL (VO)

The Miracle

And finally BACK TO

INT GUSS CAR - SAME
Gus has one eye on the road the other on Hazel He was
impressed with her before Hes totally dazzled now

HAZEL
Tumors shrank my mets have hardly
grown since

(MORE)

HAZEL (CONTD)
Of course my lungs still suck but
theoretically they could continue
to suck in just this way for I
dunno a while maybe

GUS
Wow
HAZEL
Yeah
GUS
So are you back in school or
HAZEL
Cant
GUS
Why not

HAZEL
Got my GED

He smiles at her She smiles back Shoves his upper arm
playfully Theyre easing into each other
Eventually Guss car pulls into his driveway

GUS
Were here
Hes as good at parking as he is at driving CUT TO

EXTINT GUSS HOUSE - SAME

Hazel follows Gus inside She quickly notices all sorts of
engraved plaques and framed signs with phrases like Home is
Where the Heart Is and True Love is Born from Hard Times
Hazel looks at Gus quizzically

GUS
My parents call them
encouragements
(rolling his eyes)
Dont ask
Guss MOM and DAD (40s) are in the kitchen making dinner

GUS

GUSS DAD
Hows it going Just Hazel

GUS

(ABRUPTLY)
Downstairs if you need us
Gus drags Hazel to the next room As shes pulled

HAZEL
Nice to meet you
They walk down the carpeted stairs - Gus having an easier
time with his one leg than Hazel is with her oxygen tank and
weak lungs
Eventually they arrive at Guss basement bedroom Theres a
TV with a video game console a few band posters anda

whole
host of basketball memorabilia (autographed sneakers school
trophies framed images etc) Gus sees her looking at them
GUS
I used to play
HAZEL
Must have been pretty good
GUS
These are mine And these The rest
of its just cancer perks
Gus grabs a DVD from his stack of DVDs Hazel sits down on
the bed her breathing noticeably heavier
HAZEL
Need to sit
Gus sits down next to her on the bed
HAZEL
Dont get any ideas
(catching her breath)
All that standing and stairs
and then more standing lotta
standing for me
GUS
I understand

HAZEL
Ill be fine in a minute Unless I
faint Im a bit of a Victorian
lady fainting-wise
Gus smiles He waits for her breathing to slow down In
time

GUS

Hazel nods smiles

GUS

HAZEL
I already told you my story I was

DIAGNOSED --

GUS

HAZEL

Gus
Interesting Whats it about

HAZEL
Cancer
(off his look)
But not in that way trust me The
guy who wrote it Peter Van Houten
hes well the only person Ive
ever come across who seems to a)
understand what its like to be
dying and b) not have died

GUS

(INTRIGUED)
In that case I am going to read
this horrible book with the boring
title that does not contain zombies
or stormtroopers And in
exchange
Gus pulls a book from his bookshelf

GUS

all I ask is that you read this
brilliant and haunting novelization
of my favorite video game
Hazel looks at the slim ridiculous novella She laughs
Shes adorable when she laughs She takes the book from him
and as she does their hands get tangled together for a
brief charged moment

GUS
Your hands are cold
HAZEL
Not so much cold as under-
oxygenated

GUS
Ooh Hazel Grace

(BEAT)
I love it when you talk medical to
me
Hazel blushes And off her completely smitten smile CUT TO

INT HAZELS BEDROOM - ANOTHER NIGHT
Hazel sits in bed reading Guss novella Frannie stands in
the doorway notices the new book

FRANNIE
Thats different
Hazel shrugs Frannie looks intrigued

FRANNIE
Did he give it to you

HAZEL
By it do you mean herpes
Frannie rolls her eyes Hazels phone buzzes She excitedly
checks it - only to be disappointed Frannie notices

FRANNIE
Im sure hell call dont worry

HAZEL
Im not worried Please Its not
like Im waiting for him to call or
anything I just we hung out No
big deal
Frannie says nothing to that Her silence says it all Hazel
rolls her eyes CUT TO

QUICK SERIES OF SCENES

Hazel continues not to wait for Guss call We see her

- Brushing her teeth And checking her phone

- Watching TV And checking her phone

- Eating breakfast And checking her phone

- Looking out the window on a rainy day Trying not to check
her phone Willing herself to not check the goddamn phone
And checking the phone
something

GODS

Where is he Did he forget about her

INT HAZELS DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Hazel at the dinner table with her parents Shes a little
sullen barely touching her food

Hazels phone buzzes She tries not to seem too eager to
check it what with her parents watching and all She subtly
looks down at her lap And sure enough a text from Gus Her
eyes bug out We see

Tell me my copy is missing the last ten pages or

Hazel smiles Goes back to eating Frannie and Michael share
a quick glance A second later theres a follow-up text
Tell me I have NOT reached the end of this book

Hazel smiles again

And then a third text

A BOOK CANT END IN THE MIDDLE OF A SENTENCE WHAT IN

NAME IS THIS MADNESS AAAAHHHH
Hazel now laughs out loud Michael clears his throat Hazel
looks up

MICHAEL
Would you like to be excused

EXT HAZELS HOUSE - BACKYARD - MOMENTS LATER
Hazel sits down on a patio chair and dials the phone Gus
answers on the first ring

GuS (0S)
Hazel Grace

HAZEL
Welcome to the sweet torture of
reading An Imperial --
At which point she hears a loud WAIL coming from the other
end of the phone

HAZEL
What the -- are you ok

GUS (0S)
Me Yeah Im excellent
INTERCUT between Hazel on the patio and

INT GUSS BASEMENT BEDROOM - SAME
Isaacs head is buried in Guss couch Hes wailing like a
banshee having some kind of nervous breakdown

GUS

(INTO PHONE)
I am however with Isaac
Hazel hears more wailing Has no idea what to make of it

GUS (0S)

(TO ISAAC)
Dude Hey Does Support Group Hazel
make this better or worse
Hazel genuinely has no idea what the hell is going on

GUS
Isaac Focus On Me
Hazel waits a few beats for Gus to come back on Finally

GUS (0S)

(TO HAZEL)
How fast can you get here
Hazel thinks about this And on her face CUT TO

INT GUSS BASEMENT - LATER

Hazel descends the steps She hears an ungodly moan before
she sees anyone What has she gotten herself into Gus
appears at the base

GUS
(calling to Isaac)
Isaac Hazel from Support Group is
coming downstairs
Gus waits for a response None comes He gestures for her to
follow him into the room Before he does

GUS
A gentle reminder Isaac is in the
midst of a psychotic episode

(HAZEL NODS)
You look nice by the way
Hazel blushes follows Gus into the room to find Isaac
sitting upside down in a gaming chair Tears are flowing
down
his reddened cheeks Empty soda cans and bags of junk food
lie around him

HAZEL
How ya doing Isaac
Again no response Hazel looks to Gus for an explanation

GUS
Seems Isaac and Monica are no
longer a going concern

HAZEL
Oh Im sorry

(BEAT)
Do you want to talk about it
Isaac starts to sob again

GUS
He just wants to cry and play video
games
HAZEL
Fair enough
GUS

It doesnt hurt to talk to him
however If you have any sage words
of feminine advice

HAZEL
I actually think his response is
appropriate

Gus

Pain demands to be felt

HAZEL
(lights up at that)
Youre quoting my book
Gus winks at her At which point Isaac lets out another
howl Gus gestures for Hazel to sit The two of them flank
Isaac He finally speaks

ISAAC
She didnt want to do it after the
surgery Said she couldnt handle
it Im about to lose my eyesight
and she cant handle it
Hazel rubs his shoulder in sympathy

ISAAC
I kept saying always to her
Always always always And she
just kept talking over me and not
saying it back It was like I was
already gone you know Always
was a promise You cant break
promises

HAZEL
Sometimes people dont understand
the promises theyre making when
they make them

ISAAC
Right sure but you keep the
promise anyway Thats what love
is Love is keeping the promise
anyway

GUS
That could be an encouragement
Its silent for a beat And then Isaac stands up a funny
look on his face

GUS
Isaac
Suddenly Isaac starts kicking his chair across the room

GUS
Here we go
The chair lands against the bed Gus hands Isaac something
else to throw a pillow Isaac grabs the pillow and slams it
against the wall He dives on it and beings pummeling the
pillow like a maniac

Gus
Thats it Punch that thing
And so he does As he continues to
cigarette dangling from his mouth

GUS
ve been wanting to call you ona
nearly minutely basis but I have
been waiting until I could forma
coherent thought in re An
mperial Affliction

(SHE SMILES)
cant stop thinking about it

HAZEL
know right

GUS

The only problem is the ending
HAZEL

t is rather abrupt

GUS
ts torture I mean I totally get
that she died or whatever - Anna
But there is an unwritten contract
between author and reader and I
think ending your book in the
middle of a sentence kind of
violates that contract

HAZEL
But thats part of what I like
about it It portrays death
truthfully You die in the middle
of your life in the middle of a
sentence But I do - God I do want
to know what happens to everyone
else

GUS
Yeah like her Mom

HAZEL
The Dutch Tulip Man

GUS
Sysiphus the Hamster

Gus looks at Hazel
Gus

Hazel beams Gus totally gets the book A bond between them

GUS
Have you tried contacting this
Peter Van Houten

HAZEL
Ive written letters Hes never
responded Apparently he moved to
Amsterdam became a recluse Hasnt
published anything Doesnt do

interviews

GUS
Sad

(BEAT)
Hang on
(turns to Isaac)
Isaac

Gus stands and takes the pillow out of Isaacs hand

GUS
Pillows dont break
Gus hands Isaac one of his basketball TROPHIES

GUS
You need to break something
Isaac looks at it then back to Gus as if asking permission

breaks into a million pieces Isaac almost smiles Gus hands
him another

GUS

GUS

Ive been looking for a way to tell

my Dad that I kinda hate

Isaac grabs more of the TROPHIES smashing them to pieces
Gus and Hazel enjoy the spectacle When there are none left
Isaac is panting standing over the bronze carnage

GUS
Feel better
Isaac thinks about it Shakes his head no Gus puts his arm
around him but looks at Hazel

GUS
Thats the thing about pain it
demands to be felt
Hazel smiles And on her face we CUT TO

Hello Augustus
GUS
So I read it again And I just kept
feeling like like it was a gift

Like youd given me something
important

HAZEL
(TOUCHED)
Youre welcome
GUS
On the other hand we need

closure dont we

HAZEL
What we need is a sequel

GUS
Yes We need to know what happens
to Annas family after she dies

HAZEL
Thats what I kept asking Van
Houten for in my letters

GUS
But he never wrote back

HAZEL
Thats correct

GUS
Because hes a recluse

HAZEL
Yeee-up

GUS
Utterly unreachable

HAZEL
Unfortunately so
Gus clears his throat smiles Hazel waits

GUS
Dear Mr Waters I am writing to

Shall I continue

HAZEL
Keep reading keep reading

GUS

â€œAn Imperial Affliction and for
taking the time to tell me that the
book and here I quote you
directly â€œmeant a great deal to
you
Hazel pays attention to every word

GUS
To answer your question No I
have not written anything else nor
will I I do not feel that
continuing to share my thoughts
with readers would benefit either
them or me However thank you again
for your generous email Yours most
sincerely Peter Van Houten

HAZEL
Youre making this up

GUS
Hazel Grace could I with my
meager intellectual capabilities
make up a letter from the great
Peter Van Houten

Go check your in-box
Hazel jumps up as fast as her lungs will allow CUT TO

Dear Mr Peter Van Houten my name

Augustus Waters who read your book

While Hazel reads the letter we see a SERIES OF SCENES
showing the next several days They include

- Hazel and Gus drinking coffees at a cafe Hes
enthusiastically telling a story and shes enjoying every
moment of it

- Hazel helping Gus become a better driver Its no use

HAZEL (VO)

I was wondering if you wouldnt
mind answering a few questions I
have about what happens after the
end of the book Specifically the

FOLLOWING
- In his kitchen laughing trying to make omelettes

HAZEL (VO)
Does Annas Mom marry the Dutch
Tulip Man is the Dutch Tulip Man
up to something - or is he just
misunderstood What happens to
Annas friends

- Watching TV Their bodies almost touching But not quite

HAZEL (VO)

Lastly I was hoping you could shed
some light on Sisyphus the Hamster
These questions have haunted me for
years And I dont know how long I
have left to get answers to them

And finally back in Hazels bedroom She finishes reading

this letter into the phone

HAZEL
I know these are not important
literary questions and that your
book is full of important literary
questions but I would just really
like to know
INTERCUT w Gus bouncing a ball against the wall

HAZEL
(reading it aloud to him)
And of course if ever you do
decide to write anything else even
if you dont want to publish it
Id love to read it Frankly Id

great admiration Hazel Grace
Lancaster Age 16

GUS

casually checks her in-box and is shocked to discover - hes
written her back

HAZEL
Holy shit

(READING ALOUD)

Dear Ms Lancaster I cannot

answer your questions at least not

in writing because to do so would

constitute a sequel which you

might publish or otherwise share on

the internet Not that I dont

trust you but how could I trust

Hazels jaw hangs open as she reads the next part
HAZEL
Should ever you find yourself in

GUS
And this is 17 year old dudes
with one leg
Hazel laughs Point made He grabs her hand helps her walk
up a tiny hill Once up there Gus lays a blanket on the
ground They sit looking out over a rather odd SCULPTURE -

set of GIANT WHITE BONES where children can jump and play

(EXPLAINING)
Funky Bones by Joep Van Lieshout

HAZEL
He sounds Dutch

GUS
And he is Much like Rik Smits And

Hazel raises an eyebrow at Gus Hes sure taking this
AmsterdamDutch thing pretty far He removes some sandwiches
and orange juice out of a basket

GUS
Sandwich

HAZEL
Let me guess --

GUS
(NODS)
Dutch cheese And tomato
(she takes one)
The tomatoes are Mexican Sorry
They eat for a second their eyes watching the children play
on the bones

GUS
How cool is that A skeleton being
used as a playground

HAZEL
You do love your symbols

GUS
Speaking of which
Gus stands up takes a cigarette puts it in his mouth He
clears his throat

GUS
Youre probably wondering why
youre sitting here eating a bad
cheese sandwich and drinking orange
juice with a guy in a Rik Smits
jersey

HAZEL
It has crossed my mind

GUS
Hazel Grace like so many before
you - and I say this with great
affection - you spent your Wish
moronically

HAZEL
I was thir--

GUS
Hush Im in the midst of a grand
soliloquy here

HAZEL
Sorry Please continue

GUS
You were young Impressionable The
Grim Reaper staring you in the
face And the fear of dying with
your one true Wish left ungranted
led you to rush into making one you
didnt really want for how could
little Hazel Grace having never
read An Imperial Affliction ever
know that her one TRUE wish was to
visit Mr Peter Van Houten in his
Amsterdamian exile
Hazel nods in agreement

GUS
If you were smart you would have
saved your wish til the time in
your life when you really knew your
true self

Gus stops talking Hazel is confused

HAZEL
But I didnt save it
Gus smiles

GUS

Good thing I saved mine
Hazel cocks her head to one side What is he talking about

GUS
Got it in exchange for the leg

(BEAT)
And I still have it
She starts to realize

HAZEL
Are you saying --

GUS
Im not gonna give you my Wish or
anything But I too have an
interest in meeting Peter Van
Houten and it wouldnt make much
sense to meet him without the girl
who introduced me to his book now
would it
(Hazels eyes widen)
I talked to the Genies and theyre
in total agreement
(BEAT)
We leave on May third
Hazel is so excited that she grabs Gus and pulls him into a
hug Their faces close lips inches apart and just when it
looks like something might happen --

HAZEL
Wait a minute

(BEAT)
Are you only doing this so Ill
kiss you
A beat Gus blinks a few times

HAZEL
Cause Id totally kiss you either
way
And kiss him she does Hes surprised And when its over

HAZEL
They have doctors in Amsterdam And

DR MARIA

very very happy to die

END SEQUENCE

INT HOSPITAL ROOM - ICU - MORNING

The sound returns And its the sound of a heart monitor
BEEP BEEP BEEP Its also the sound of a working heart
Hazel has made it through Her eyes open A NURSE is there

HAZELS NURSE
Hello

HAZEL

HAZELS NURSE
Youre ok Hazel
Even Hazel seems surprised by that

HAZELS NURSE
Would you like to see your parents
Hazel nods The Nurse goes to get them Soon they come
bounding in crying and kissing her repeatedly So much
relief CUT TO
LATER Hazels bed has been raised up so she can talk to her
parents comfortably

FRANNIE
They thought it was a brain tumor

MICHAEL
It wasnt - thank god --

HAZEL
So what happened

FRANNIE
The usual Fluid in the lungs
preventing oxygenation They put
that in
Theres a TUBE in Hazels side draining fluid into a plastic
bladder that hangs off her bed

FRANNIE
Drained a liter and a half last
night
(Thats a lot of fluid)

MICHAEL
The good news is no tumor
growth No new tumors in your body
Hazel nods That is a relief

MICHAEL
Were all so relieved
Frannie embraces her daughter

FRANNIE
This is just a thing Hazel Its a
thing we can live with
Hazel nods again Only in the universe of Hazel Grace
Lancaster is something like this just a thing Meanwhile

INT HOSPITAL ICU - WAITING AREA - LATER

INT HOSPITAL - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAYS LATER

Hazel and her Parents sit at a very large conference table
along with Dr Maria and THREE OTHER ONCOLOGISTS - her whole
Cancer Team

ONCOLOGIST 1
The great news is Phalanxifor
continues to control your tumor
growth

(BEAT)
The not so great news is were
still seeing serious problems with
fluid accumulation

(BEAT)
So how should we proceed
Silence Hazel looks around the room waits for someone to
answer No one does

HAZEL
Um I feel like Im not the most
qualified person to answer that

ONCOLOGIST 1
I was talking to Dr Simmons

DR SIMMONS (late 60s white beard old school) speaks next

DR SIMMONS
Its a strange case Normally the
tumors start resisting the
treatment But that hasnt happened
here - yet
Hazel hears the yet the loudest

DR SIMMONS
Unfortunately the drug may be
worsening the edema

DR MARIA

But if we stopped it entirely
were likely to face even graver
dangers

MICHAEL
So were gonna do nothing

DR MARIA
Thats what we have to decide The
truth is very few people have

been on Phalanxifor as long as
Hazel has We dont really know the
long term effects
That comforts no one

HAZEL
Cant I just get like a lung
transplant or something
The Doctors look at one another like who wants to take that
one Eventually

DR MARIA

You would not be considered a

strong candidate for a transplant

Hazel takes that in nods tries to pretend it didnt bother
her Sensitive Michael on the other hand starts to cry a
little bit He grabs Frannies hand

DR SIMMONS

Were trying to prevent endothelial

growth while at the same time

preventing immunosorbent
As Dr Simmons drones on with some cancer gobbledygook
Hazels eyes remain firmly fixed on her parents She hates
what shes doing to them And seeing them holding hands
crying but trying not to cry - it jogs a memory CUT TO
INT HOSPITAL ICU - FLASHBACK

We saw this once before It looks like the end for 13-year
old Hazel Her father is weeping off to the side while her
mom stands over her holding her hand and asking

FRANNIE
(through the tears)
Are you ready sweetie
13-year old Hazel nods The doctors get to work The
anaesthetic takes hold and Hazel goes under But not enough
Cause she totally hears her mother say

FRANNIE
I wont be a mom anymore

She falls into her husbands chest And were BACK TO

INT HOSPITAL - CONFERENCE ROOM

Hazel comes out of the memory when her parents see her
staring at them She tries to shake it off Dr Simmons is
still talking nonsense when

HAZEL
I have a question

DR MARIA
Yes Hazel

HAZEL
Can I still go to Amsterdam
Dr Simmons cant help himself He laughs Everyone looks at
him He clears his throat

DR SIMMONS
That would not be wise at this
juncture

HAZEL
Why not
DR SIMMONS
Excuse me

HAZEL

Why not Dr Simmons
DR SIMMONS

I --
The doctors are trying to be delicate here

DR MARIA
It would increase some risks --

HAZEL
So does going to the mall --

DR MARIA
Yes but an airplane

HAZEL
They have oxygen on airplanes

FRANNIE
HAZEL --

HAZEL
Its my life right

DR SIMMONS
Youre Stage IV --

HAZEL
I have this opportunity I may never
have again If the medicines
working I dont see why --

DR SIMMONS
Because Hazel

(BEAT)
Look I dont know any other way to
say this Youre just too sick

And this is like a punch in the gut

DR SIMMONS

rain but not yet delivering it She sits down in the grass
on the verge of tears She looks at the old rusty SWING SET
thats been in her backyard for years

And starts to cry Just for a few brief moments she lets
herself cry

Then she wipes the tears Becomes strong again And makes a
decision

Hazel dials her phone We hear

Hazel nudges her head onto his shoulder

HAZEL
Thanks for coming over

GUS
You do realize trying to keep
your distance from me will in no

Hazel looks at him Hes sure not making this easy

GUS
Is this about Amsterdam Cause we
DONT --

HAZEL

Hazel nods

GUS
I get it One day youre going to

GUS
Theres already two people in your
life youre going to destroy Why

Hazel looks at him not understanding

GUS
In case you were wondering

Youre so busy being you that you
have no idea how utterly
unprecedented you are
Hazel absorbs that Her feelings for this boy in a tangle

EXT HAZELS HOUSE - BACKYARD

Gus and Hazel watch as a TOWNIE finishes loading the swing
set into the back of his PICK-UP Gus salutes the swing set
as the truck drives off

FRANNIE

Dr Maria called last night and
made a convincing case that you

Hazel cant move all that fast to hug her Mom so Frannie

comes to her and they embrace After

FRANNIE

Frannie pulls up to Guss house They get out of the car and
head to the front door buzzing with excitement

As they get close they can hear a commotion inside A
WOMANS VOICE yelling something unclear followed by

Frannie immediately puts her arm around Hazel and quickly
spins her back to the car

HAZEL
Mom

FRANNIE
We cant eavesdrop Hazel
Back at the car far out of earshot they wait Hazel unsure
what that was about Frannie politely honks the horn
A moment later Gus emerges from the house smiling A travel
bag over his shoulder and a cigarette dangling from his

EXT AIRPORT - ESTABLISHING
A SKYCAP helps Hazel Gus and Frannie with all their bags

equipment

INT AIRPORT - MOMENTS LATER

They wait in line for the security checkpoint When its
Hazels turn she unhooks the plastic nubbins from her nose
Gus places the oxygen tank on the conveyer belt

Hazel takes slow careful steps through the metal detector
She seems determined to get through this without any help
But upon reaching the other side its clear that even these
few steps without oxygen were a struggle

Hazel holds on to the side of the conveyer belt to steady
herself As soon as her tank reappears she puts the cannula
back in place Still light-headed Hazel closes her eyes and
focuses on her breathing She catches her mom looking at

nervously
HAZEL
(with some difficulty)
Amsterdam

INT AIRPORT GATE - LATER

Arriving at the Gate area they draw curious looks from the
OTHER PASSENGERS Hazel with her oxygen tank Gus with his
noticeable limp and Frannie helping with the equipment

A YOUNG COUPLE gets up so that Hazel and Gus can sit

HAZEL
Oh thats not necessary
But they give up their seats anyway Hazel and Gus take

We see various Passengers watching Hazel ignores the
attention until a LITTLE GIRL (6 cute braids) appears

LITTLE GIRL
Whats in your nose

HAZEL
Its called a Cannula These tubes

The GIRLS MOTHER swoops in a little frantic

GIRLS MOTHER
Jackie Oh Im sorry

HAZEL

(SINCERE)

Hazel removes her cannula and lets the Little Girl try it

LITTLE GIRL
Tickles

HAZEL

LITTLE GIRL

HAZEL
Well Id love to give you my
cannula but I kinda really need

The Little Girl nods hands it back to Hazel who quickly
reattaches it

LITTLE GIRL

They smile at each other before the Little Girl walks back
to

her family She waves Hazel waves back

Hazel sits in the middle with Frannie on the aisle and Gus
at

the window He looks around antsy

HAZEL
Have you never been on a plane
before
Gus shakes his head he has not And hes nervous He pulls

cigarette out of his pocket and puts it in his mouth Within
seconds a FLIGHT ATTENDANT rushes over

FLIGHT ATTENDANT
Sir you cant smoke on this plane
Or any plane

GUS
(cigarette in his mouth)
I dont smoke
The Flight Attendant shoots him a look

HAZEL

Its a metaphor He puts the
killing thing in his mouth but
doesnt give it the power to kill
him

FLIGHT ATTENDANT

(NO NONSENSE)
That metaphor is prohibited on
todays flight
Gus nods and puts the cigarette away

PA SYSTEM
Flight attendants prepare for
departure
The engines roar to life and the plane accelerates towards

grabs
the arm rest his eyes wide

HAZEL
Ok

EXT INT AMSTERDAM HIGHWAY - TAXI CAB - MORNING
Hazel Gus and Frannie ride in the back of a YELLOW CAB

CAB DRIVER
Americans
dirt

and

sagging

FRANNIE
Were from Indiana

CAB DRIVER
Indiana They steal from the
Indians but the keep the name yes
Hazel and Gus share a look

HAZEL
Something like that
Meanwhile the landscape outside is flat and dusty with

tracks and the occasional concrete building In other words
it looks more like Indianapolis than Holland

HAZEL
(to the Driver)
This is Amsterdam

CAB DRIVER
Yes and no Amsterdam is like the
rings of a tree It gets older as
you get closer to the center
Soon enough the cab takes an off-ramp and turns a corner

suddenly its as if theyre transported - not only to
another universe but to another time as well

We see MULTI-COLORED ROW HOUSES lined on both sides of a
windy CANAL HOUSEBOATS float against the edges and everyone
rides BICYCLES down cobblestone streets Theyre astounded

INT HOTEL - LATER

Gus helps Hazel and Frannie bring their stuff into the room
We see a WICKER BASKET of gifts - presents from the Genies -
welcoming their arrival Hazel exhausted sits on the bed

INTEXT AMSTERDAM - ON THE TRAM - LATER

Hazel and Gus ride the crowded tram through the city ELM
TREES line the canals their pale petals blowing into the
wind like a spring snowstorm

An OLD COUPLE stands to give up their seats - this happens
all the time Hazel again tries to protest and again it

on deaf ears She and Gus sit They look out the window onto
the city Excited The night just beginning
EXT ORANJEE RESTAURANT - LATER
At the edge of the canal near an ancient bridge Hazel and
Gus are shown to a TABLE right next to the water

(BEAT)
â€œCome quickly he said â€œI am

Hazel and Gus smile

WAITER

Gus looks at Hazel She shrugs

GUS
The chefs choice sounds lovely

The Waiter leaves Hazel and Gus look at each other

Hazel leans back in her chair in need of a breather

HAZEL
I like your suit

GUS
Thanks First time wearing it
HAZEL
That isnt the suit you wear to
funerals
GUS
Oh no That ones not nearly this
nice
(off her look)
When I first found out I was sick -

I mean they told me I had like an
85 chance to be cancer-free Great
odds sure But that meant a year
of torture the loss of my leg and
still a 15 chance it might fail

(BEAT)
So right before the surgery I asked
my parents if I could buy a suit

GUS

made of clouds but yeah I believe

Hazel is surprised
GUS
Something becomes of us It has to
Otherwise whats the point

HAZEL
Maybe there is no point

GUS
I refuse to accept that

(BEAT)
I wont accept it
Hazel thinks about it She appreciates his conviction but is
still not sure she agrees The hand theyve been dealt too
unfair Hazel looks out at the water as she says

HAZEL
I hope youre right

Gus
Im in love with you

That gets her attention

GUS
You heard me

HAZEL
AUGUSTUS --

GUS
Im in love with you And I know
that love is just a shout into the
void and that oblivion is
inevitable and that were all
doomed and that there will come a
day when all our labor has been
returned to dust and I know the
sun will swallow the only earth
well ever have and I am in love
with you
(shrugs matter-of-fact)
Sorry
At which point the Waiter reappears

WAITER
More stars

Hazel is still too speechless to respond her eyes fixed on
Gus Eventually Gus answers for them

GUS
Just the check please

WAITER
No sir

(BEAT)
Your meal has been paid for by Mr
Van Houten
Gus raises his eyebrows at Hazel This Van Houten guy is
something else

EXT AMSTERDAM CANALS - LATER

Hazel and Gus on a park bench his arm around her looking
out over the water Seeds blow from the elm trees and the
reflections of the city ripple in the water below them
Hazel leans into his body just a little They stay like
that savoring the best night of both of their lives CUT

EXT AMSTERDAM - HOTEL - ESTABLISHING
A crisp Spring morning in Amsterdam The buzz in the air
outside is equalled by the buzz in

INT HOTEL ROOM - SAME
Where Hazel excitedly paces through the room

FRANNIE
I really dont get that shirt
Hazel wears a screen print t-shirt of Magrittes Ceci Nest
Pas Une Pipe (A painting of a pipe with words below that
mean This is not a pipe)

HAZEL
Van Houten will get it Trust me
There are like fifty Magritte
references in Imperial
Affliction

FRANNIE
(READING)
This is not a pipe

HAZEL
Exactly

FRANNIE
But it is a pipe

HAZEL
No its not Its a drawing of a
pipe See

(SHE DOESNT)
All representations of a thing are
inherently abstract A drawing of a
thing is not the thing itself Nor
is a t-shirt of a drawing of a
thing the thing itself
Frannie is still at a loss but shes impressed

FRANNIE

hen did you get so grown up I
eel like it was yesterday I was
elling 8-year old Hazel why the
y was blue You thought I was a
enius back then

QqQudms

HAZEL
Why is the sky blue

FRANNIE

(BEAT)
Because I say so
A knock on the door Gus pokes his head in

GUS
Whos ready for some answers

EXT VONDELSTRAAT ROW HOUSES - LATER
Gus and Hazel stand outside Van Houtens white house
HAZEL

Im so excited I can barely
breathe
oxygen

Theres

He

faces

GUS
As opposed to other days
She playfully hits him He takes her arm picks up the

tank and up they go towards his front door

As they approach theres a noticeable NOISE coming from
inside the house Its the deep thump of a BASS BEAT Loud
Like obnoxiously loud

Hazel grabs the brass ornament and knocks They wait

no response

GUS
Maybe he cant hear over the music
Gus tries again this time with more force Still nothing

tries a third time Finally the music stops They wait
Still excited

A moment later the door swings open

Its a MAN IN PAJAMAS (60s) with a huge potbelly thinning
hair and a week-old beard All he says is

MAN IN PAJAMAS
What
Gus and Hazel look to one another Could it be

GUS
Mr Van Houten

At which point the Pajama Man slams the door in their

Hazel and Gus are too stunned to react Through the closed
door they hear this

MAN IN PAJAMAS (0S)
(SHOUTING)

LEEE-DUH-VIGH

WOMANS VOICE (0S)

Are they here Peter

So it is PETER VAN HOUTEN Gus and Hazel cant believe it

MAN IN PAJAMAS (0S)
There are two --

(BEAT)
Who the hells they

will

it

WOMANS VOICE (0S)

They are Augustus and Hazel the

young fans with whom youve been

corresponding

Gus and Hazel smile at hearing their names Perhaps this

help things take a turn for the better

MAN IN PAJAMAS (0S)
The Americans

WOMANS VOICE (0S)
You invited them remember

MAN IN PAJAMAS (0S)

You know why I left America

Lidewij To never have to encounter

Americans Get rid of them

Hazel and Gus cant believe it This is terrible

WOMANS VOICE (0S)

I will not do this Peter Be nice
At which point the door opens - opened by the Woman whose
voice theyd been hearing - Van Houtens assistant LIDEWIJ
(30s Dutch pretty in a bookish way) She virtually shoves
Van Houten towards a stunned Gus and Hazel
And they are again face-to-face with Van Houten One beat
two beats No one knows what to say Finally

VAN HOUTEN
Which of you is Augustus Waters
Gus raises his hand tentatively
Van Houten sizes them up Without another word he turns and
walks inside - at least this time leaving the door ajar

LIDEWIJT
Please I am sorry Come in
Hazel and Gus share one more awkward glance before Gus takes
a step Hazel follows They walk

INT VAN HOUTENS HOME - SAME

Lidewij leads Gus and Hazel into a living room so sterile
its creepy The walls are empty and white theres a single
couch a small ottoman and a single lounge chair Thats

Van Houten sits in the chair
Off to the side are two large black garbage bags full and
twist-tied
HAZEL

Trash

LIDEWIT
Fan mail 18 years worth He never
opens it

Van Houten kicks his feet up on the ottoman and crosses his
slippers He motions for them to sit on the couch

VAN HOUTEN
Yours are the first missives to
which Ive replied and look where
that got me
Hazel and Gus take their seats

VAN HOUTEN
Scotch

HAZEL
Um no thanks

VAN HOUTEN

Augustus Waters

GUS
Its llam

VAN HOUTEN
Just me then Lidewij Scotch and
soda

LIDEWIJT

Perhaps some breakfast first Peter

VAN HOUTEN
She thinks I have a drinking
problem

LIDEWIT

I also think the Earth is round
Nevertheless Lidewij pours Peter half a glass and hands it
to him He takes a sip then sits up straight

VAN HOUTEN
So you like my book

HAZEL
Yes We - well Augustus he made
meeting you his Wish so that we
could come here and talk to you
Van Houten says nothing Takes a long pull on his drink

VAN HOUTEN
Did you dress like her on purpose

HAZEL
(looks at her shirt)
Kinda

Van Houten says nothing to that

VAN HOUTEN
I do not have a drinking problem I
have a Churchillian relationship
with alcohol I can crack jokes and
govern England and do anything I
want to do Except not drink
He glances over at Lidewij who dutifully refills his glass

GUS
Incidentally thank you for dinner
last night

VAN HOUTEN

(TO LIDEWIJ)
We bought them dinner last night

LIDEWIJT
It was our pleasure

VAN HOUTEN

(SIGHS)
Youve come a long way so what
is it I can do for you

HAZEL
We have some questions --

VAN HOUTEN
Uh-huh

HAZEL
About what happens you know
after the end of your book

Specifically to those who Anna
leaves behind Like her Mom the
Dutch Tulip Man Sisy --

VAN HOUTEN

(INTERRUPTING)
How familiar are you with Swedish
hip-hop
Hazel looks at Gus Is he kidding

HAZEL
I would say limited

VAN HOUTEN
But presumably you know Afasi Och
Filthys seminal album Flacken

GUS
Um

VAN HOUTEN
Lidewij Play â€œBomfalleralla
immediately

Lidewij sighs but she does as shes told A few seconds
later some loud Swedish rap song blasts from the speakers
Hazel and Gus sit through this totally baffled

HAZEL
(yelling over the music)
Im sorry sir We dont speak
Swedish

VAN HOUTEN

(YELLING)
Who the hell speaks Swedish The
important thing is not what
nonsense the voices are saying but
what the voices are feeling
The song continues another awkward ten seconds or so before
Gus has enough He gets up and turns off the music

GUS
Are you messing with us

VAN HOUTEN
Pardon
GUS
Is this some kind of performance

VAN HOUTEN

Rudolf Otto said that if you had

not encountered the numinous then

his work was not for you And I say

to you my friends if you cannot

hear Afasi Och Filthys bravadic

response to fearfulness then my

work is not for you

Hazel is really getting worried at this point They came all
this way for this

HAZEL
So anyway when the book ends
Annas mom --

VAN HOUTEN

(raising a hand to silence

HER)
Let us imagine that you are racing
a tortoise
Hazel and Gus fidget in their seats Lidewij frowns clearly
feeling bad for them Van Houten continues

VAN HOUTEN
The tortoise has a ten yard head
start In the time it takes you to
run ten yards the tortoise has
moved maybe one yard And so on
forever

(MORE)

VAN HOUTEN (CONTD)

You are faster than the tortoise
but you can never catch him you
see you can only decrease his
lead Now certainly you can run
past the tortoise as long as you
dont contemplate the mechanics
involved but the question of how
turns out to be so complicated that
no one really solved it until
Cantors proof that some infinities
are bigger than other infinities
Hazel and Gus have no idea how to respond
VAN HOUTEN
I assume that answers your
questions

GUS

(TO HAZEL)
I dont know whats going on

VAN HOUTEN
And yet you seemed so intelligent
in print Mr Waters
(under his breath)
Must be all that cancer in your
brain

LIDEWIJT
Peter
Gus could throw a punch right now Hazel tries to calm the
situation

HAZEL
Can we please maybe talk about
Anna for a sec I mean I
understand that the story ends mid-
sentence because she dies or she
becomes too sick to continue --

VAN HOUTEN
Im not interested in talking about
that book

HAZEL

- but that doesnt mean her family
and everyone she loves doesnt have
a future right

VAN HOUTEN
I said Im not interested --

HAZEL

(GETTING UPSET)
But you promised

(CALMS HERSELF)
(MORE)

HAZEL (CONTD)
Mr Van Houten you said you would
tell us what happens and thats why
were here We I need you tell
me Surely youve thought about it
I mean as characters --

VAN HOUTEN
Nothing happens to them Theyre
fictions They cease to exist the
moment the novel is over
This is not what Hazel came all this way to hear She wont
accept it

HAZEL
They cant
(again has to calm

HERSELF)
I mean I understand In a literary
sense But its impossible NOT to
imagine some future --

VAN HOUTEN
I cant do this Lidewij get rid
of them please
(Lidewij doesnt move he
turns back to Hazel)
I wont indulge your childish
whims I refuse to pity you in the
manner in which youre accustomed

HAZEL
I dont want your pity --

VAN HOUTEN
Of course you do Like all sick
kids your existence depends on it

LIDEWIJT
Peter

VAN HOUTEN
(on a roll)
You are fated to live out your days
as the child you were when
diagnosed the child who believes
there is life after a novel ends
And we as adults we pity this so
we pay for your treatments for
your oxygen machines We give you
food and water though you are
unlikely to live long enough --
LIDEWIT
PETER

VAN HOUTEN
You are a side effect of an
evolutionary process that cares
little for individual lives

(MORE)

VAN HOUTEN (CONTD)
You are a failed experiment in
mutation

LIDEWIT

I RESIGN

Lidewij has tears in her eyes Gus has balled his fists But
not Hazel Van Houtens words have not phased her one bit
She rises from the couch

HAZEL

Hey listen douchepants Youre not
gonna tell me anything I dont
already know about illness I need
one thing and one thing only from
you before I walk out of your life
and thats for you to tell me what
happens to your goddman characters

VAN HOUTEN

(BEAT)
I cannot tell you

HAZEL
Bullshit

VAN HOUTEN
I cannot --
Van Houten goes to take a drink but

HAZEL
Make something up
Hazel smacks it right the fuck out of his hands
surprising everyone
After a beat
VAN HOUTEN
Lidewij Ill have a martini
please

LIDEWIJT
I have resigned

VAN HOUTEN
Oh dont be ridiculous
No one moves Van Houten realizes hes alone in this

VAN HOUTEN
Id like you to leave now

HAZEL
Youre really not gonna tell us

VAN HOUTEN
I would like you to leave

Hazel is furious Gus stands next to her touches her arm is
if to say come on enough of this guy CUT TO

EXT VAN HOUTENS HOUSE - SAME
Gus and Hazel come out of the house practically shaking As
they get to the street Van Houten has one more thing to

say
VAN HOUTEN
Have you ever stopped to ask why
you care so much about your silly
questions
A beat
HAZEL
Go fuck yourself
Van Houten doesnt have a response to that He just shuts
the

door And when he does thats when Hazel gets emotional

GUS
Hey Its ok Its ok
(beat an idea)
Ill write you a sequel
(she cries harder)
I will Better than any shit that
drunk could write With blood and
guts and sacrifice Youll love it
Hazel nods then wipes away tears She fakes a smile and Gus
gives her a hug Afterwards

HAZEL
I spent your Wish on that asshole

GUS
You did not spend it on him You
spent it on us
They embrace once more

HAZEL
I wanted

GUS
I know I know Apparently the
world is not a wish-granting
factory

This gets a real smile from Hazel Thats when Lidewij comes
outside Clearly shes been crying too

LIDEWIT
Im so sorry Circumstance has made
him cruel I thought meeting you
would help him if he would see
that his work has shaped real
lives but Im very sorry

Hazel says nothing Gus holds her in a very protective way

LIDEWIT
Perhaps we can do some sightseeing
Have you seen the Anne Frank House

GUS
Im not going anywhere with that
monster

LIDEWIT

He is not invited

EXT ANNE FRANK HOUSE - LATER
Lidewij walks back from the ticket kiosk with more bad news

LIDEWIJT
Im afraid theres no elevator
oxygen

HAZEL
Oh um thats alright

LIDEWIT
No there are many stairs Steep
stairs

HAZEL
I can do it

GUS

HAZEL --

HAZEL

I can do it
Hazel is not going to stand for any more disappointments
today They are going inside CUT TO

INT ANNE FRANK HOUSE - GROUND FLOOR - MOMENTS LATER

A VIDEO plays on a MONITOR showing the Nazi invasion of
Holland Hazel and Gus stand with Lidewij in a pack of
BACKPACKERS and TRAVELERS about to take the tour Many of
them begin to walk up the first flight of stairs

LIDEWIT
Shall we
Hazel nods Both Hazel and Gus walk slowly up the stairs So
far so good They find themselves in an office space

LIDEWIJT
This is the bookcase that hid the
Frank family and four others
The BOOKCASE is half open Behind it is an even steeper set
of stairs only wide enough for one person at a time

Some of the Travelers begin to walk up the stairs Gus looks
at Hazel - are you sure we should continue She begins the
climb determined Lidewij trails behind carrying her

tank

Hazel moves very slowly We are aware of her labored
breathing the entire time

ANGLE ON OTHER TOURISTS watching and quietly commenting
Just like at the airport except now in foreign languages
Hazel arrives on the NEXT FLOOR - an empty room Shes
the

definitely starting to struggle She leans against the wall
to catch her breath Gus comes to her side wipes her brow

GUS
Youre a champion
Hazel smiles When shes feeling up to it they walk into the
next room also empty And another staircase even more
narrow and steep - practically a ladder When Gus sees this
he looks at Hazel

GUS
Thats enough --

HAZEL

(RESOLUTE)

Im ok
Hazel very slowly begins the climb Again were aware of her
every breath Its dark And its becoming very difficult
Near the top Hazel stumbles but is finally able to pull
herself through
Once there she falls to the floor slumping against the
wall trying to catch her breath Gus crouches next to her

GUS
Were at the top Thats it
Hazel becomes aware that TOURISTS look at her with concern
She smiles stands up nothing to see here
And now theyre in the final room - a long narrow hallway
This is where Anne Frank and 7 other people lived in hiding
for as long as they could Theres a TIME LINE detailing
their story

LIDEWIT
The only member of the whole family
to survive was Otto Annes father
Gus takes Hazels hand

LIDEWIJT
I dont know how you go on without
your family

Lidewij stays behind to study part of the exhibit Gus leads
Hazel into the room at the end of the hallway where a VIDEO

details the last days of Anne Franks life Over it we hear
a YOUNG GIRLs VOICE reading from the diary

The Travelers stand to watch and listen Gus and Hazel do

same The room is dark
me-

quickly

second

the

blushes

GIRLS VOICE (0S)

At such moments I dont think

about the misery
Gus and Hazel stand very closely together The video is the
cherry on top of a very emotional day Hazel watches it

GIRLS VOICE (0S)

but about the beauty that still

remains
Gus meanwhile is just watching Hazel the same way she
watched him on the airplane After a beat she catches him
Their eyes meet The emotions build

GIRLS VOICE (0S)
Try to recapture the happiness
within yourself Think of all the
beauty in everything around you
and be happy
And Hazel KISSES Gus A most passionate intense you-and-

against-the-world kind of kiss better than any theyve
experienced or could even imagine It seems to last for a
small eternity

Eventually they break away and open their eyes They

notice all the Travelers staring at them For a brief

they wonder if that was a very inappropriate thing to do
When suddenly everyone starts clapping for them moved by

whole thing One EUROPEAN even shouts bravo Hazel

Gus smiles bows he grabs her hand CUT TO

INT GUSS HOTEL ROOM - LATER
They fall onto Guss bed kissing Hazel is very in the
moment and now its Gus who seems nervous As they kiss

GUS
Its above my knee
She ignores him more kissing She takes off his shirt

Gus
It tapers a little and then its
just skin --

HAZEL
What
They

Hazel pulls away from him

GUS
My leg

(BEAT)
Just so youre prepared --

HAZEL
Oh get over yourself
Hazel kisses him again Now he tries to pull her shirt off
but it gets tangled in with her oxygen tube He cant figure
it out Eventually the whole thing is hilarious to them

shake their heads - laughing - certainly not your typical
Hollywood movie moment And yet for them

HAZEL
I love you Augustus Waters

GUS
I love you too Hazel Grace
They resume kissing And we CUT TO

INT HOTEL ROOM - MORNING

Gus wakes up in the bed He looks around for Hazel but she
isnt there On the bed is a piece of paper A note

It reads Dearest Augustus

Beneath that is a BIG CIRCLE labeled Virgins And in that
circle is a SMALLER SECOND CIRCLE labeled 17 year old dudes
with one leg Well notice part of that circle is now
outside the bigger circle Gus flashes that signature smile

EXT CAFE - DAY
Hazel and Gus sit with Frannie drinking coffee in the sun at
an outdoor cafe Theyre re-enacting yesterdays events

HAZEL
Get up you fat bastard

GUS
T cant stand up Im too drunk

HAZEL
I said get up

GUS
Standing is for fools

HAZEL

They both giggle at the whole thing

HAZEL
It was awful Mom You cant

FRANNIE

And then what happened

HAZEL
Then we went to the Anne Frank
museum

FRANNIE

And after that
A quick glance between Hazel and Gus

HAZEL
We just walked around
Hazel and Gus smile thoroughly in love but trying to keep

in check in front of her Mother

FRANNIE
Sounds lovely
A few beats later

FRANNIE
Listen Im gonna stretch my legs
a little Give the two of you some
time to talk

HAZEL

(THATS WEIRD)
Um Ok
As she stands up to leave Hazel thinks she catches Gus and
Frannie making eye contact for a brief second Once Frannie
has left them

HAZEL
That was weird
Gus doesnt respond except to say

GUS
Shall we

EXT AMSTERDAM STREET - LATER

They start to walk Gus takes a cigarette out of his pack
sticks it between his lips Hazel notices hes struggling
with something

HAZEL
Augustus

GUS
Theres something I have to tell
you

They walk in silence a few beats

GUS
Just before you went into the
hospital There was this I
felt this ache in my hip

Hazel grabs onto his arm a lump already forming

HAZEL
Oh no
Gus takes the cigarette out of his mouth clenches his teeth
tightly trying not to cry

GUS
I had a PET scan
Gus sits down on a BENCH Looks up at her Tries to smile
Before he even says it she knows

GUS
It lit up like a Christmas tree
Hazel

HAZEL
Oh god

GUS
The lining of my chest my liver
everywhere

HAZEL
Oh my god no
Hazel loses it in that moment falling on top of him
hugging
him for dear life her head in his lap

HAZEL
Im so sorry Augustus Im so so

SORRY --
GUS
m sorry too --
HAZEL
ts so unfair --
GUS

should have told you --

HAZEL
ts so fucking unfair
A beat Gus still trying not to cry

GUS
Apparently the world is nota
wish-granting factory
And at that point Gus lets it go lets himself cry and be
sad and feel awful
But just for a second Then he shakes it off pulls Hazels
face up to his tries again to smile through the tears

GUS
Dont you worry about me Hazel
Grace Ill find a way to hang
around and annoy you for a long
time
She hugs him perhaps a little too tightly He winces

HAZEL
Does it hurt

GUS
Its ok

(BEAT)
Im ok

HAZEL
Ok

GUS
Ok
But of course its not ok Not by a mile
Hazel takes a moment to look at him touches his cheek

GUS

He grabs her hand and holds it

GUS
I dont suppose you can forget
about it treat me like Im not
dying

HAZEL
I dont think youre dying

of cancer
Gus nods Squeezes her hand

GUS
Would it be absolutely ludicrous to
make out right now

Hazel doesnt answer She just kisses him hard And on the
two of them so in love we CUT TO

INT AIRPLANE - LATER

and finds him sitting there his shirt stained with vomit
blood She gags from the smell
GUS

(MUMBLING)
Hi

his belly She sees something is leaking from the TUBE
sticking out of it

HAZEL

(PANICKED)
Oh God Augustus Im calling 911

Hazel doesnt know what to do

HAZEL
I cant fix this I have to call
someone Im sorry

GUS
No Hazel please
But she must She gets out her cell phone and dials At
which
point Gus really loses it weeping like the poisoned dying
teenage boy that he is As Hazel dials we hear

HAZEL (VO)

I wish I could say Augustus Waters
kept his sense of humor till the
end did not for a moment waiver in
his courage and his spirit soared
like an eagle to the sky

GUS
(to himself shaking)
I hate myself I hate myself I hate
this I hate this

HAZEL (VO)

moving Gus grabs her hand

Gus
Read me something

HAZEL
Read you something
do

GUS
Do you know any poems

HAZEL
I know one

GUS
Read it to me

HAZEL

The Red Wheelbarrow by William
Carlos Williams

(beat tries to remember)

So much depends upon a red
wheel barrow glazed with rain
water beside the white
chickens

GUS
(BEAT)
Is that it

That is it But theres another ten minutes of driving to

Hazel thinks fast

HAZEL
No of course not Um what
else

(THINKS )

so much depends upon a blue sky

cut open by the branches of the

trees So much depends on the

transparent G-tube erupting from

the belly of the blue-lipped boy
Gus smiles weakly barely conscious Hazel cradles his head
in her arms And continues

HAZEL
So much depends upon this observer
of the universe
As Gus is drifting off to sleep WE HEAR

HAZEL (VO)
One of the less bull-shitty
conventions of the cancer genre is
the convention known as the Last
Good Day

EXT GUSS HOUSE - ANOTHER DAY
Gus comes home from the hospital He does not look good -
but

he lives Hazel is there to help get him inside

INT GUSS HOUSE - ANOTHER DAY

Gus no longer sleeps in his basement Nor does he sleep in
his own bed He sleeps in a HOSPITAL BED set up in a guest
room Hazel is with him Theyre watching sports on TV

HAZEL (VO)

This is where the victim of cancer
finds himself unexpectedly with
some hours

EXT GUSS BACKYARD PORCH - ANOTHER DAY

Hazel and Gus getting some fresh air She sits there reading
a book Gus just sits there His eyes staring off into
nothing Hazel waves to him Gus looks over as if waking
from a dream She manages a smile He manages one back

HAZEL (VO)

when it seems like the
inexorable decline has suddenly
plateaued when the pain is for a
minute bearable

INT HAZELS DINING ROOM - ANOTHER DAY

Hazel sits at dinner with her parents She is barely
touching

her food

HAZEL (VO)

The problem of course is that
theres no way of knowing that your
last good day is your Last Good
Day At the time its just
another decent day
The phone buzzes and Hazel

HAZEL

BUT --

MICHAEL

INT CHURCH - LATER
Hazel enters the Literal Heart of Jesus room which is now
empty except for Isaac up on a dais and Gus in his
wheelchair Gus is thinner than weve ever seen him thinner
than any young man should be But for now hes happy

GUS
Hazel Grace you look ravishing

HAZEL
I know right

(BEAT)
So um whats going on guys

ISAAC
Youre late

HAZEL
Late for what exactly

Gus gestures for her to sit next to him and she does

GUS
I wanted to attend my funeral By
the way will you speak at my
funeral
Hazel looks at him like of course silly and then kisses
him on the mouth

GUS
Sweet Im hopeful Ill get to
attend as a ghost but just to make
sure I thought Id - well not to
put you on the spot but I thought
Id arrange a pre-funeral

HAZEL
Why now

GUS
No time like the present

HAZEL
(looks around the room)
How did you even get in here

GUS
Would you believe they leave the
door open at night

HAZEL
Um no

GUS
As well you shouldnt
He smiles and for a brief moment its old Gus Hazel laughs
Isaac clears his throat

ISAAC
Augustus Waters was a self-
aggrandizing bastard But we
forgive him We forgive him not
because he had a heart as
figuratively good as his actual one
sucked or because he got 18 years
when he should have gotten more

GUS

ISAAC
Im assuming youve got some time
you interrupting bastard I mean
seriously
(back to the speech)
Augustus Waters talked so much
that hed interrupt you at his own
funeral And he was pretentious

(MORE)

ISAAC (CONTD)
Sweet Jesus that kid never took a
piss without pondering the
resonances of human waste
production And he was vain But
that comes with superhuman
handsomeness
Gus nods - that part is true

ISAAC

But I will say this when the

scientists of the future show up at

my house with robot eyes and they

tell me to try them on I will tell

the scientists to piss off because

I dont even want to see a world

without Augustus Waters
Hazel smiles - but its one that triggers an immediate
emotional waterfall
ISAAC
And then of course having made
my rhetorical point I will put my
robot eyes on because I mean

robot eyes
Gus has a big smile on his face

ISAAC
So anyway Augustus my friend
Godspeed
Gus nods a couple times

GUS
Thank you Isaac
This causes Isaac to lose it He clings to the lectern

ISAAC
Goddamn it Gus

GUS
Hey dont swear in the Literal
Heart of Jesus

ISAAC

Shit Ass Balls
Isaac sighs Wipes away the tears And another beat passes

ISAAC
Can I get a hand here Hazel
Hazel remembers Isaac cant see She rises goes up to get
him walks him back to her seat

GUS
Hazel Grace its down to you

Hazel takes out a piece of paper walks up to the dais
Takes
a beat to ready herself

HAZEL
Augustus Waters was the great star-
crossed love of my life Ours was
an epic love story and I wont be
able to get more than a sentence
into it without disappearing into a
puddle of tears

(BEAT)
Like all real love stories - ours
will die with us as it should Id
hoped that hed be eulogizing me
because theres no one Id rather
have
And thats all she can get out before falling apart She
lets
it out for a couple beats and then pulls herself together

HAZEL

(beat composing herself)

T cant talk about our love story
so instead I will talk about math
I am not a mathematician but I
know this there are infinite
numbers between 0 and 1 Theres 1
And 12 And 112 And an infinite
collection of others Of course
there is a bigger infinite set of
numbers between 0 and 2 or between
0 and a million Some infinities
are bigger than other infinities A
writer we used to like taught us
that I want more numbers than Im
likely to get and God I want more
numbers for Augustus Waters than he
got But Gus my love I cannot
tell you how thankful I am for our
little infinity You gave me a
forever within the numbered days
and for that I am eternally
grateful I love you
Gus smiles nods and closes his eyes CUT TO

BLACK
Over which we hear a RINGING TELEPHONE

INT HAZELS BEDROOM - NIGHT

Hazel turns on the LIGHT by her bed Her HOUSE PHONE is
ringing and its 4am

She knows instantly

HAZEL (VO)

Augustus Waters died eight days
later in the ICU
Hazels head falls into her chest
HAZEL (VO)

when the cancer which was made
of him stopped his heart which
was also made of him
Her bedroom door opens Its Frannie and Michael This only
confirms her worst fears She starts to cry Her parents
embrace her in the bed

HAZEL (VO)
It was unbearable The whole thing
Every second worse than the last

EXT HAZELS HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - SAME

Hazel sits in the car in the dark Shes blaring the loudest
music she can possibly blare - a means of drowning out the
horrors of the world Over which we hear this

HAZEL (VO)

One of the first things they ask
you in the ER is to rate your pain
on a scale from 1 to 10 Id been
asked this question hundreds of
times and I remember once early
on when I couldnt catch my breath
and it felt like my chest was on
fire and the nurse asked me to
rate the pain and though I couldnt
speak I held up 9 fingers
The loud music isnt protecting Hazel as well as she hoped
She falls apart nonetheless

HAZEL (VO)

Later on when Id been feeling
better the nurse came in and she
called me a fighter You know how
I know she said Because you
called a ten a nine

INT HAZELS BEDROOM - ANOTHER MORNING
Hazel puts on her funeral dress She looks in the mirror

HAZEL (VO)

But that wasnt the truth The
reason I called it a nine was I
was saving my ten

INT CHURCH - DAY

The place is filled today with mourners for Augustus Waters
Hazel comes in with her parents and stands in the back
watching people shes never seen before approach the Waters
family and extend their deepest condolences

HAZEL (VO)

And this was it The great and

terrible ten

When Mr and Mrs Waters see Hazel they open their arms

MRS WATERS
He loved you so much
Hazel nods Hugs them back

HAZEL

He loved you so much too

More MOURNERS approach the family leaving Hazel stranded in
the receiving line Her eyes turn towards the COFFIN Shes
not entirely sure she wants to go there but she takes a deep
breath wills herself to walk towards it

Gus is there in the same suit he wore to Oranjee
Immediately Hazel breaks down And immediately she catches
herself

HAZEL
Its ok you hear me Its ok
She leans forward and kisses his cheek She looks around
Once in the clear she pulls out a hard pack of Camel Lights
and sticks them in the space between Gus and the lining of
the coffin A MINISTER approaches at that moment

MINISTER

I think were ready to begin
Hazel nods and walks back to her parents taking her seat in
the middle of the room

MINISTER
Augustus Waters fought hard for
many years His battle was a
courageous one and his strength was
a source of inspiration for each
and every one of us
Hazel frowns This is all such bullshit And she hears

MALE VOICE
What a load of shit eh kid
Hazel recognizes that voice But it doesnt make sense She
turns around and sure enough its Peter Van Houten

MINISTER
Let us pray
Everyone clasps their hands closes their eyes Hazel keeps
staring at Van Houten too shocked to do a thing

VAN HOUTEN
We need to fake pray now
Van Houten bows his head Hazel still stunned slowly turns
back to the Minister trying to make sense of this
unexpected
appearance

MINISTER
Now I call on Augustuss close
friend Isaac to say a few words
Isaac stands walks up to the podium with someones help
Hazel sneaks one more look at Van Houten Yup its really
him That makes no sense to her Isaac starts to speak

ISAAC
Of all the things Ive lost in my
life this hurts the most
And Isaac stops talking Its unclear if that was the end or
if he just cant go on He returns to his seat The Minister
walks back up

MINISTER
And now well hear from Guss
special friend Hazel Lancaster
Hazel stands walks up to the podium A few titters in the
room at the words special friend

HAZEL
I was his girlfriend
Some laughter from the crowd She takes out her notes

HAZEL
Theres a beautiful quote in Guss
home that reads if you want the
rainbow you gotta deal with the
rain
Hazel continues to speak but we over it WE HEAR instead

HAZEL (VO)

I didnt believe a word of course
But that was ok Funerals Id
decided arent for the dead
TO

Theyre for the living
Guss Parents arm in arm nod along with every word CUT

burial Hes watching Hazel CUT TO

GUSS VOICE

Mr Van Houten Im a good person

Hazel is overcome with emotion

GUSS VOICE

She asked me to write one and Im

trying I just I could use a

little flair See the thing is

we all want to be remembered
She smiles to herself remembering
- That first time Gus and Hazel ran into each other
- The staring contest in Support Group

GUSS VOICE
We all want to leave a mark
- Driving (badly) in Guss car
- Their first kiss at the picnic by Funky Bones

GUSS VOICE

But not Hazel Hazel is different
Hazel knows the truth She didnt
want a million admirers she just
wanted one And she got it Maybe
she wasnt loved widely but she was
loved deeply And isnt that more
than most of us get
movie

- And BACK TO HAZEL reading the letter

GUSS VOICE
When Hazel was sick I knew I was
dying But I didnt want to say so

INT ICU - FLASHBACK

tears in her eyes

Gus stealthily sneaks into Hazels single room in the ICU

She sleeps He kneels by her side

GUSS VOICE
She was in ICU and I snuck in for
ten minutes and sat with her before
I got caught Her eyes were closed
her lungs were intubated

Gus takes her hand and holds it

GUSS VOICE

but her hands were still her
hands still warm and the nails
painted this dark blue back color
and I just held her hands and I
willed myself to imagine a world
without us and what a worthless
world that would be

- AND BACK TO HAZEL reading the letter
story never knew he was there CUT TO

EXT HAZELS HOUSE - BACKYARD - LATER

She never knew that

Hazel walks out to the grass behind her house the oxygen
tank dragging behind her She lays down on the grass and
looks up at the stars - the same IMAGE that opened the

GUSS VOICE
Shes so beautiful You dont get
tired of looking at her You never
worry if shes smarter than you
cause you know she is Shes funny
without ever being mean

SHE REMEMBERS
- The magical dinner at Oranjee

- The bench in which they sat overlooking the water
- The passionate kiss in Anne Franks house
we

her

- Falling onto the bed together

All of these are images we saw at the beginning of the
movie only now we SEE the oxygen tank we SEE Guss leg

SEE the fumbling and the difficulties etc They dont make
these images less beautiful They make them twice as
beautiful - because theyre real
GUSS VOICE
I love her god I love her Im so
lucky to love her Van Houten
(MORE)

GUSS VOICE (CONTD)
You dont get to choose if you get
hurt in this world but you do have
a say in who hurts you
- AND BACK ON Hazel in the grass She holds the letter to

chest A single tear falls onto her cheeks

GUSS VOICE
I like my choices I hope she likes
hers

Hazel CLOSES HER EYES

GUSS VOICE
Ok Hazel Grace

A beat Another
Hazel OPENS HER EYES And she says to the universe

HAZEL
Ok
