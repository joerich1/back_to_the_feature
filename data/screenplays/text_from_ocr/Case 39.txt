INSPIRED BY REAL EVENTS

Pitch black We hear FOOTSTEPS sneaking up an old wooden
staircase Two people moving as one

Topping the stairs they creep down the hall to the closed
door that protects us We can hear them behind it
whispering bickering insanely one shushing the other

The squeak of a door knob slowly turning The faint click of
the latch And the door inches open throwing a razor-thin

shaft of light into the darkness where it illuminates a

FRIGHTENED EYE

As a ten-year-old GIRL sits up in bed Dead tired Staring
at the two dark faces peering in at her

GIRL
I can see you

And the door closes leaving us once more in total darkness
We can hear them bickering again as they shuffle away their
footsteps descending the stairs fading into the uneasy
silence of this old house

A young teacher (DARLA) chalks a lesson on a blackboard in a

base of a triangle times half the height
equals the area
eight-

A girl in the back row raises her hand

DARLA
Yes Mia

GIRL
Lucys asleep again

Darla puts down the chalk and comes up the aisle to where a
slight fair-skinned girl in a thrift shop dress sleeps head
down on her desk The girl from the opening scene LUCY
SHERIDAN Darla stands over her with obvious concern Puts

a finger to her lips to quiet the giggles

DARLA
Let her sleep

She draws the shade It drops a shadowbox on the sleeping
girl

EMILY

What are they doing to you

EXT SHERIDAN HOUSE - DAY

A dark rundown family home on a once-prosperous cul de sac
Emily pulls up Gets out Checks that she has the right
address Halfway up the walk something stops her dead in her

TRACKS -

A WOMANS FACE
staring at her through one of the lacy white curtains
upstairs Ghostly pale Gone as soon as she sees it Emily
stands frozen for a moment Walks on

She reaches to knock on the door and it opens abruptly the
security chain snapping taut A womans voice growls at her
from the darkness inside

WOMANS VOICE
What

EMILY
Emily Jennings Child Services We
spoke on the phone

Peering through the crack is the pallid bony face from the
upstairs window Lucys mother MARGARET SHERIDAN

MARGARET
You said the seventeenth

EMILY
Today is the seventeenth

MARGARET
Is not

EMILY
Im sorry but it is

MARGARET
Friday was the thirteenth

Emily rather amazed at the conversation shes having takes
a newspaper from her bag Indicates the date

EMILY
Friday was the fourteenth that makes
today the seventeenth Monday the
seventeenth The date of our
appointment

The door closes in Emilys face What the hell Then we

hear the chain unlock It opens again

And we get our first good look at Lucys mother Gaunt
Pale Dark rings under her eyes She steps aside not
welcoming Emily in merely allowing her to enter

INT SHERIDAN HOUSE - DAY
Its dark the curtains drawn Margaret twitches one open in
begrudging courtesy The house is tidy but sad steeped ina
kind of puritanical gloom Lucy peers down through the
upstairs banister anxious unsure whats going on Emily
sees her smiles

EMILY
Come down Id like to meet you

Lucy hesitates sensing her mothers disapproval Comes
slowly down the stairs Emily shakes her hand

EMILY
My names Emily Whats yours

LUCY
Lucy

EMILY
Pretty name Pretty girl

Lucy turns shyly away

EMILY
(TO MARGARET)
Is there somewhere we can talk

Margaret sighs and heads down the hall
INT LIVING ROOM SHERIDAN HOUSE - DAY

Emily file in hand trying to project professionalism in an
arm chair that tilts to one side Margaret and Lucy sitting
opposite on the sofa

EMILY
When do you expect your husband back

Margaret shrugs
EMILY
Because weve found its more beneficial

if the whole family participates

MARGARET
Well hes not home so

Shrugs again

EMILY
Do you have any way of contacting him

MARGARET
Not if I dont know where he is

Just then we hear a POWER TOOL go on in the basement Emily
sensing the lie indicates the floor

EMILY
Is that

Margaret averts her eyes

EMILY
Would you ask him to join us

MARGARET
He doesnt have anything to say

EMILY
Would you ask him

Margaret weighs Emilys resolve gives Lucy a cautionary
glance then exits We hear her open a door and holler into
the basement over the noise of the power tool

MARGARET (0S)
Edward EDWARD

The power tool stops

MARGARET (0S)
That ladys here From the state She
wants to talk to you

We hear an angry unintelligible reply

MARGARET (0S)
I already told her she wants to anyway

We hear the power tool get thrown aside FOOTSTEPS pounding
up the cellar stairs Emilys and Lucys faces reflect the
same simple fear Their eyes meet

EMILY
Itll be okay

Lucy not so sure The FOOTSTEPS are upon them EDWARD
SHERIDAN makes his entrance A menacing man with a gaunt
face and dark deep-set eyes Emily holds out her hand

EMILY
Hi Im Emily --

Edward forgoes the handshake his contempt obvious Sits
beside Lucy on the sofa Margaret sits on the other side
Lucy tenses trapped between them Emily speaks with
kindness and composure Hostile encounters part of the job

EMILY
Im here today because Lucys school is
concerned about changes theyre seeing in
her academic performance The kinds of
changes theyre seeing are often
associated with family problems

Edward leans over and whispers something caustic in
Margarets ear

MARGARET
Eddie says we dont have family problems

EMILY
Thats just it many times a family wont
even know theyre having problems until
its too late Thats where we come in
We help families communicate and learn
healthier ways of resolving conflict

Edward whispers again in Margarets ear

MARGARET
Eddie says we dont need your help

EMILY
Mr Sheridan is there some reason you
wont speak to me directly

Edward just stares at her

EMILY

(TO MARGARET)
Is there some reason why your husband
wont speak to me directly

Margaret nods gives Edward a look as though for permission

MARGARET
Eddie doesnt like speakin out of anger

Emily does well to hide her fear Refusing to be
intimidated she engages Edwards stare A battle of wills
But his gaze has a murderous intensity she cant match
looks down shuffling papers Battle lost

other stuff takes care of itself

Wayne nods his agreement Edward puts his arm around Lucy
for effect Her eyes go to Emily A silent plea for help

(HOSTILE)
Tell me Mr Sheridan since youve

Lucys grades have gone from As to Ds

fountain Emily bends for a sip after Misfires As she
wipes her face embarrassed

They havent laid a finger on her that we

intend to Meanwhile on your desk right

abuse What about those

EMILY
Im not giving up on her Wayne

WAYNE
Yes you are youre leaving this alone

A look that says he means it

EMILY
I hope you can live with a dead child on
your conscience

WAYNE

(HURT)
Thats a little unfair dont you think
I care about these kids as much as you
do but we cant go around yanking them
out of their homes on a hunch Parents
even bad ones have rights thats how
the laws of this great land are written

Emily gives a resigned nod backing away from him from the
job all of it

So thats it We let kids get killed
until they rewrite the goddamn laws

She exits before he can answer doesnt want to hear it

situation this one child - its clear
whats best for her

The head of the panel is a bloated bureaucrat in a polka dot
blouse (NANCY)

The door pushes open Emily peering in A sad little master
bedroom with old floral printed wallpaper and water stains

the ceiling

She explores the room inspecting various personal items -
aftershave glasses hair brush - looking for clues to their
madness

An ALARM CLOCK with a cracked crystal face She picks it up
and it GOES OFF in her hand Gives her a scare She puts it
down Sees something out the bedroom window Steps closer
Parts the curtains

In the backyard by the garden shed a long rectangular hole
has been dug A SHALLOW GRAVE filling with leaves Edwards

handiwork Emilys seen enough heads for the door

But slows noticing something odd as she comes back around
the bed -
A LONG DEEP SCRATCH

in the wooden floor hidden under a long runner rug Emily
peels back the rug and finds -

HUNDREDS OF LONG DEEP SCRATCHES

in the floorboards leading toward the door Something - the
old oak bureau perhaps - has been dragged repeatedly across
the room

Emily comes over and looks behind the door and sees on the
back of it something even more bizarre -

TWO MASSIVE DEADBOLTS

screwed hastily crookedly into the wood She closes the
door Slides-to the big heavy bolts -

CLUNK
CLUNK

Pauses Looks again at the bureau Slides it in front of
the door a wheelless caster bracket leaving another long
scratch in the hardwood And its clear at this point what
the deadbolts and bureau add up to -

A BARRICADE

Emily stares at it Looks over at Edward and Margarets bed
imagining them here behind this door Slides the bureau
aside Opens the deadbolts And as the door swings open she
is looking straight down the hall at

features

The CYCLICAL SQUEAKING NOISE we hear is Lucy in Emilys
cubicle in the bg turning herself in circles on the

reappearance of that pale watchful face

Finished Emily walks back to her cubicle thrown by the

Doug with a look of frank appraisal It is the face of a
child but behind those eyes there is a keen intelligence

LUCY
Ill tell you what scares me if you tell
me what scares you

Doug did not see this coming

DOUG
Fair enough When I was twelve I was
climbing a tree and I accidentally put my
hand through a giant hornets nest They

INT EMILYS HOUSE - NIGHT

Tense dinner Emily barely touching hers Lucy absently
but with an almost surgical precision is CUTTING PEAS IN

Lucy stares at Emily for a moment then sits again And its
strange her posture seems subtly different stiffer
bonier
as if all her muscles have drawn taut under her clothes In
a voice at once innocent and menacing

LUCY
Doug said something didnt he

EMILY
No Doug He says youre doing great

Tense silence

LUCY
What did he tell you

Nothing

Lucy stares at her seeing through the facade Then oddly
bright taking a bite of food

INT DOUGS CONDO - NIGHT

Football highlights on a liquid plasma tv Doug flipping
through a DSM IV diagnostic manual The phone RINGS He

picks up distracted scanning the DSM index

DOUG
Hello

A strange INTERMITTENT STATIC BUZZ on the line

DOUG
Hello

BZZZZT BZZZZT BZZZZT A telecommunications glitch

DOUG
Try again sorry

He hangs up Finds the chapter hes looking for ANTI-
SOCIAL PERSONALITY TYPE But he hears it again now -

BZZZZZZZZT BZZZZZZ2ZZ2ZT - louder deeper - and realizes in
quiet terror that its coming from INSIDE HIS EAR

INT DOUGS BATHROOM - NIGHT

Doug opens the medicine cabinet and grabs a Q-tip Wiggles
it around in his ear and when he takes it out theres a

HORNET
sitting on the cottony tip scissoring its wings
Doug stares in disbelief Mouth gaping

He throws the Q-tip in the toilet Hits the flush lever
Watches the hornet spiral away Gone

Stares at the empty bowl Did I just imagine that

Shaken he turns to the sink Wedges his head under the tap
and runs water into his ear
his

RISING

tosses

Straightens and looks at himself in the mirror toweling his
face trying to impose rational thought on the situation
But as the water spills from his ear down his neck onto

shirt it brings with it -
TWO MORE LIVE HORNETS half drowned

With a yelp Doug swipes them from his shirt Crushes them
underfoot Terrified but clinging to rational thought a
moment longer he turns his head sideways to the mirror
parts his hair and sees -

ANOTHER HORNET crawl from the ear canal followed by SIX OR
SEVEN MORE

DOUG
FUCK

Rationality goes out the window He flails at them with the
towel Swats them dead Picks them up and drops them in the
toilet Studies the last one for a moment Its little legs
twitching Drops it in Flushes

A false respite And a brief one Because as the FLUSHING
NOISE FADES he can hear an ominous DEEP BUZZING SOUND

Its coming from behind him He turns to have a look
Nothing there Bare wall

But its strange the BUZZING IS STILL BEHIND HIM
With dawning horror Doug turns and checks his back in the
mirror sees

HIS ENTIRE SHIRT BACK IS CRAWLING WITH HORNETS

Whimpering like a child he undoes the buttons of his shirt
taking it off as delicately as possible Slipping his arms
gently from the sleeves

Holding it by the collar he takes two quick steps and

it in the shower Slams the glass door seals the crack with
towels And watches the hornets fly around in the glass

enclosure BUZZING FURIOUSLY bouncing off the glass

But as he backpedals he realizes the FURIOUS BUZZING is too
close too loud and too deep to be coming from the shower
over there A sharp pain in his head confirms it He GROANS
and brings a hand to his ear as something awful happens
inside

The BUZZING in his right ear spreads to his left - LOUDER
ANGRIER its sources multiplying Disoriented he stumbles
backwards with an AGONIZING SCREAM Catches sight of himself
in the mirror the terror of the moment on his face This
cant be happening

And now the nightmare takes a devilish turn Looking at
himself in the mirror he sees —

HORNETS START CRAWLING FROM HIS NOSE FROM BETWEEN HIS LIPS
FROM UNDER HIS EYELIDS THE BUZZING NOW UNBEARABLY LOUD AN
ENTIRE SWARM RAGING INSIDE HIS SKULL FIGHTING ITS WAY OUT

Doug grabs his head in both hands and starts shaking it
trying to shake away the madness inside But the hornets
eep coming COUGHED UP IN CLUMPS as he gasps for air
Theyre all over him stinging his tongue his eyes

He goes berserk and starts SMASHING HIS HEAD against the
wall the door the edge of the sink anything he can find
opening a deep gash in his forehead smashing it harder and
harder because the BUZZING WONT STOP cracking his skull
SCREAMING HYSTERICALLY pitching his head violently forwards
and backwards like some demon-possessed heavy metal fanatic

ts a grotesque display that ends on a sickening note when
with one particularly violent head jerk he snaps his own
neck - CRACK He sinks to the floor head askew
astonished look on his face

And there he sits paralyzed eyes locked on the tv in the
living room where football highlights play in silence Fully
conscious as the hornets fight their way back into his ears
nose and mouth - a pilgrimage back to the mind that bore
them

inflicted yes

EMILY
Oh come on He looked like hed been
beaten to death Dont tell me he was
some - some suicidal

(BREAKING DOWN)
I knew him He was my best friend

She turns away crying

CORONER
Miss I would never presume to know your
friend better than you But the injuries
suggest he was trying to hurt himself
Unfortunately he succeeded I am sorry

Emily composing herself gives a quiet nod She has no
quarrel with this man

violence people do to themselves

the wider implications

sensing Emilys stare And with her head still turned away

LUCY

She turns to face Emily who measures her words

for Emilys hand Trapped in the lie Emily has to let her
And as she drives on in that private hell holding hands

To kill her

INTERVIEWER
Why

An eerie smile comes to Margarets face

INTERVIEWER
Why is that funny Margaret

MARGARET
“Cause shes not my daughter

INTERVIEWER
Youre her mother

MARGARET
I bore her but shes not mine

two brothers Brent and Travis

Margarets voice falters Overcome by grief she dissolves
into tears Its a side of her weve never seen Human

MARGARET
and I mean they was healthy boys
healthy as can be Eddie three sisters
Soon as she was born they started dying

INTERVIEWER
You blame Lucy for their deaths

Margaret nods yes wiping her eyes Embarrassed
Unaccustomed to crying in front of strangers

she found somebody else Now that she
has I dont imagine were long for this

knocked ajar in the struggle The tape ends as they take
Edward screaming to the floor

EDWARD
ITS NOT CHILD KILLING IF SHES NOT A
CHILD

And thats the interview Emily stares at the BLANK BLUE
SCREEN transfixed lowers her gaze to the table

Theres a PHOTO tucked inside the psychiatric file Edward
and Margaret in happier times - YOUNG BIBLE CAMP COUNSELORS
in T-shirts and hiking boots on a path through sunlit

Sweet Innocent Emilys age The year they met perhaps

She holds it up to the newspaper mugshots for a before-and-
after comparison The transformation of their faces is
shocking Emily sits frozen by the realization Edward and
Margaret Sheridan Not criminals Victims

INT STATE PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - DAY

An old brick orphanage turned psychiatric hospital Emilys
Volvo goes up the winding tree-lined drive

CHIEF PSYCHIATRIST (VO)

INT STATE PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - DAY

Emily and the CHIEF PSYCHIATRIST walk down a dark
institutional corridor

CHIEF PSYCHIATRIST
Woke up screaming absolutely
convinced she was on fire She wasnt
of course they managed to sedate her
But its curious she displays all the
symptoms of a burn patient Except the
burns themselves

Margarets door Emily peers through a little square of
reinforced glass A padded cell Margaret strapped to a
bed Writhing in pain Laboring to breathe Eyes swimming

CHIEF PSYCHIATRIST
In no condition for visitors as you can
see If youd like I could let you see

She casts a departing glance through the window and shudders
to see that Margarets roaming eyes have locked on her ina
hollow stare

INT VISITATION ROOM PSYCH HOSPITAL - DAY

Restrained in a straitjacket Edward is brought in by two
orderlies who seat him at a table opposite Emily and then
exit Jaw wired everything he says is spoken through
clenched teeth

EMILY
I know Im probably the last person you
want to see right now but youre

His stare unnerves her She stops and collects herself

EMILY
Youre the only one I can talk to
Lucys been staying with me -

EDWARD
Who died

Emily falls silent Her voice cracks with emotion

EMILY
A friend

Edward nods yup Regards her in silence Emily speaks or
tries to just to fill that awful void

EMILY
I ummm
EDWARD
Youre scared

Emily skewered again nods yes

EDWARD
You oughta be

Dead silence She meets his gaze And there is eye contact
true understanding

EDWARD
You judged us before you ever walked in
that house Sat there in our living room
tellin us about our problems how to be
better parents - certain of everything
and dead wrong about all of it

(THEN)
Ask what you came to ask

After a moment

EMILY
What is she

Its a question Edward has asked himself once or twice He
leans back in his chair and folds his arms with an almost
casual air

EDWARD

Can tell you what shes not She not a
daughter of mine Shes not a ten-year-
old having trouble in school Shes not
some innocent victim whose door you
busted down and life you saved And
shes not going no place lady till
shes good and done with you

EMILY
Done with me how

EDWARD
However she wants You think its an
accident her ending up with you She saw
you coming a mile away

EMILY
Why me I dont have anything
EDWARD
You have that youre good Kindness
Decency Thats what she feeds on
Bleeds ya dry moves onto the next We
were a big family she went through us
like a wrecking ball And you know
every time something happened every
time we had an excuse for why it wasnt
her fault Cuz its easier to lie to
yourself than think bad things about your
baby girl But finally we got to a point
where me and Maggy looked at each other -
(remembers so clearly)
- where we looked at each other and we
was out of lies both of us Most
terrifying moment of our lives And
thats where you are now

Emily silently registering this truth

EDWARD
Tll tell you this She sees everything
And what she doesnt see she just sort of
senses it like when you call a friend
and they pick up before it rings

(MORE)

EDWARD (CONTD)
Only time you got the upper hand is when
shes sleepin but she almost never does
We checked on her every night for three
months Every twenty minutes up and
down those stairs First time she slept
was the night you kicked in my front
door

After a moment

EMILY
What does she want

EDWARD
To know what your idea of hell is
and make you live there

Emily sits in haunted silence Edwards features soften

EDWARD
Im not a hateful man I look at you and
I wish I could tell you youre through
the worst of it That its gonna work
out for you in the end I wish I could

EMILY
What should I do

A pitying smile reveals Edwards wired teeth

EDWARD
How strongs your faith

With urgency Emily removes all her backup files from the
shelf in Lucys room Dropping them in bankers boxes
Stops on Diegos Eyes his photo Drops it in Grabs the
office phone boxes it with the files

INT EMILYS HOUSE - DAY

Emily unplugs the phone in the kitchen Unplugs the one by
the sofa

Opens the closet and tosses the phones inside with the
bankers boxes she put there Closes the door Locks it
Hides the key

Just then a FLASHING RED LIGHT draws her gaze to the window

A SCHOOL BUS

stopping at the end of the block Emily crosses to the
window watching as

LUCY

gets off and comes up the sidewalk toward the house Sensing

Emilys stare she stops and meets it Waves testing the

waters Emily waves back but its a hollow gesture Lucys
smile fades knowing this as she continues toward the house

In a sudden panic Emily goes into the kitchen grabs one of
the knives Eyes the blade forced to contemplate the
unthinkable - its use as a weapon self-defense

She comes into the living room holding it Catches sight of
herself in the mirror A jarring image

Sweet Emily Jennings with a butchers knife in her hand

The sound of LUCYS FOOTSTEPS on the front steps breaks the
spell

Emily hides the knife behind the fish tank No good you can
see it through the glass

We hear LUCYS KEY IN THE LOCK

Emily grabs the knife Its in her hand as the door CLICKS
open until the last second when she tosses it under a sofa
pillow

Lucy enters Shy Innocent A ten-year-old home from
school

LUCY
Hi

Emily returns a plastic smile

EMILY
Hi

LUCY
You werent there so I took the bus

EMILY
Sorry work - lost track of time

LUCY
Its okay I know how busy you are

Emily watches unnerved as Lucy crosses to the sofa to the
very pillow where she hid the butchers knife and sits down
to untie her shoes The point of the knife is almost
touching her leg If she moves at all it will cut the skin

LUCY
Doesnt matter anyway the bus stops
right at the end of the street So I can
always get home whether youre there or
not

EMILY
Lucky

Lucy nods then pauses and looks at the pillow or appears
to

but she is actually looking at the end table

LUCY
Wheres the phone

EMILY
Oh it wasnt working

Lucy nods oh Finishes untying her shoes then gets up and
walks into the kitchen checks the wall turns to Emily

LUCY
Wow That one too

Emily caught in a lie says nothing

LUCY

Emily nods Lucy heads into the bathroom Pauses at the
door back turned

LUCY
Are they being nice to her

EMILY

LUCY
My mother

She turns for Emilys reaction

EMILY
How - how would I know that

LUCY

her

EMILY

I never said that
Lucy frowns A bewilderment that seems genuine

LUCY
Hm I must have dreamt it

Goes into the bathroom Closes the door

we sweep past it to see her crouching by a phone jack in the
corner Whispering

EMILY
I dont care Robin anywhere Just find
somewhere that will take her Tonight

I dont want this girl in my house

Emily unplugs the phone And just then hears a SOFT BREATH
behind her Oh shit Slowly turns

Lucy walks out We hear her bedroom door close

Emily crouched in the corner holding the phone terrified
the thought of whats in store

trembling she lines up the last screw It slips from her

fingers ROLLS UNDER THE DOOR

She cracks opens the door Reaches to grab it and lets out a
SHRIEK recoiling -

FEET
standing just outside her door
LUCY IN PAJAMAS HOLDING THE SCREW

She hands it back to Emily making no overt acknowledgement
of it

LUCY
Good night

She walks down the hallway to her bedroom

As soon as Lucys door closes Emily closes hers and goes
back to work doublespeed Winds that last screw into the
wood and then slides-to the heavy bolts

CLUNK CLUNK CLUNK

Scooting backwards she sits against the bed wide-eyed with
terror screwdriver clutched in her fist like a stabbing
weapon

EXT OLD STONE CHURCH - DAY
A bell TOLLS in a steeple

Down below Emily is going against the tide walking up the

BARRON
You wanna end up where they did keep
talking like this

Diego did

EMILY
Arent you

BARRON
Diego grew up in a bad home he saw
violence and he repeated it thats the
cycle you know that better than anyone

EMILY
Why did she lie about calling him

BARRON

“Cause shes a liar that doesnt mean
she made him do it Look let me tell
you what Lucy is Lucy is a damaged
child a deceitful child a manipulative
child But a damaged deceitful
manipulative child is not a demon Ask
my brother-in-law hes got a couple of

Barron stands from the bench

EMILY
Mike you know Im not crazy Dont run
away from something just because it
scares you

His concern edges toward sadness He indicates the church

BARRON
I stopped you on the steps I think
maybe you oughta go all the way in

Walks off to rejoin his wife and son Emily alone on a bench
in the shadow of a church

INT CORRIDOR OUTSIDE GROUP THERAPY - DAY

The circle of abused children Lucy among them a happy
participant Nancy filling in for Doug

Its EMILYS POV - as she spies on Lucy through the window
second-guessing herself for a moment

Session over Nancy dismisses the group with a smile and
theatrical applause

Emily watches Lucy cross the room At the coat rack she
whispers something to another girl The veil of Lucys hair
partially obscures her profile but through that veil Emily
sees something chilling For a moment a moment so fleeting
it might just be a trick of the eyes -

LUCYS LIPS APPEAR THICKER MORE MASCULINE SPEAKING CAUSTIC
WORDS THAT HOLD THE OTHER GIRL CAPTIVE

Emily draws a sharp inward breath Lucy feeling Emilys
stare now turns to meet it Her SWEET INNOCENT GIRL LIPS
widening into a smile

But Emily knows what she saw She throws open the door and
rushes in

Emily opens her mouth to reply but Lucy beats her to the
punch

LUCY

Its okay Nancy Emilys been under a
lot of stress lately but shes really
nice to me and I hope I can stay with her
a really long time

Nancy disarmed by the glowing praise turns back to Emily

NANCY
Well talk about this later

Nancy doesnt hear busily reassuring parents damage

Suddenly the ELEVATOR LURCHES TO A VIOLENT STOP It buckles
Emilys knees She is terrified practically
hyperventilating

EMILY
W-w-whats happening -

Lucy has gotten her attention

LUCY
Can I go back to group next week

EMILY
Youre never going back there

Lucy looks at her as one regards a small dumb animal Then
looks up at the ceiling

LUCY
Are you sure

Horror as Emily realizes what shes thinking We hear the
first CABLE SNAP above them In the CREAKING HUSH that
FOLLOWS
EMILY
No

The second CABLE SNAPS The elevator goes into a HELLISH
FREE FALL

The acceleration is dizzying

Emily clutches the rail with both hands SCREAMING as the
elevator goes cannonballing down the shaft Lucy indifferent

as they plummet toward certain death

The floor indicator light races toward L the car shuddering
violently the noise deafening Its a horrible way to die

Emily closes her eyes in anticipation of impact And in the

sudden BLACKNESS theres no noise at all Just a soft
DISTINCT

DING

A breathless pause then Emily opens her eyes And sees the
elevator is no longer falling Never was The doors glide
open to the first floor lobby

Lucy gives her a quiet look and strolls out A businessman
steps into the elevator watching bewildered as Emily
releases her white-knuckled grip on the railing and staggers
out so badly shaken she can barely stand

She steps out suitcase in hand

Tiptoes down the hall Quietly as possible as she comes past
Lucys door Its open a crack The room pitch black

LUCY IS SITTING IN THE PASSENGER SEAT

Emily recoils with a SCREAM throwing her body against the
window behind her Lucy sits there silent betrayed

Its too much for Emily She breaks down Buries her face
in her hands and sobs

Lucy after a moment takes a brush from Emilys bag and
starts lovingly brushing her hair

Emily slowly lifts her head resigning herself to this

horror She sits zombie-like behind the wheel tears
streaming as Lucy tugs gently at the snarls playing mommy

LUCY
Dont be sad This is your new
beginning

SHADOWS on the walls of the bedroom

Emily huddles in the corner wrapped in a blanket clutching

the screwdriver

There is a KNOCK on the bedroom door Emilys EYES JERK WIDE
OPEN She looks at the door but doesnt answer

Emily listening barely breathing Is that it Is she gone
And then suddenly - WHAM - WHAM - WHAM - the pounding
turns VIOLENT practically shaking the door off its hinges
Far too violent for a little girl

Emily wedges herself into the corner absolutely petrified
There is something very strong and very angry on the other
side of that door SHRIEKING in the voice of a child -

LET ME IN

WHAM —- WHAM — WHAM - WHAM - WHAM - WHAM The door getting
absolutely pummeled looking like it might splinter from the
force And its so intense that its almost surreal what
Emily is seeing Lucys voice eerily monotone the words
coming inhumanly fast like some auctioneer from hell -

LUCY (0S)

Let me in let me in let me in let me
in let me in let me in let me in let
me in let me in let me in

Relentless Tormenting Emily Until she cant take it
anymore And she SCREAMS as loud as she can half cursing
half begging the veins standing out in her neck -

EMILY
LEAVE ME ALONE

And the POUNDING STOPS DEAD All we hear is the rain
drumming on the roof And Emilys QUICK TERRIFIED BREATHS as
she stares at the door wondering whats next

But theres nothing Just the shadows dancing on the walls
It appears the nightmare is over for now

But not quite
A sudden CLUNK in the closet makes her jump Her head snaps
around - what was that She just stares unable to breathe

because whatever she just heard is INSIDE HER ROOM

White-knuckled grip on that screwdriver Emily stands up and
comes slowly over to the CLOSET DOOR
reaches

Whirling

Raises the screwdriver Ready to stab

Takes hold of the door handle

Slowly turns it

Opens the door

PITCH BLACK inside

A tense pause as she stares into that blackness then

a hand into the closet feeling around for the pull-string
Finds it Gives it a tug And there right in front of her
is a vision of unspeakable horror

MARGARET SHERIDAN

Twitching spasmodically in a hospital gown HIDEOUSLY
BURNED

She comes at Emily arms flailing clumsy with rage and
dementia Emily leaps aside and Margaret goes careening into
the furniture howling and spinning like some crazed
Dervish
Emily scrambles over the bed Reaches the door Fumbles at
the deadbolt Here comes Margaret At the last second Emily
gets the door open Runs out

INT HALLWAY - NIGHT

Tears a path down the dark hallway Margaret right behind
her hideous reeling hitting the walls with her flailing
arms
Emily throws open the front door
EXT EMILYS HOUSE - NIGHT

Dashes from the house into the abandoned street Running in
the rain Margaret comes crashing out of the house chasing
her down the middle of the street
Emily sees a city bus parked up ahead Makes a run for it

EXT METRO BUS - NIGHT

A metro transit bus idling along the curb The DRIVER with
SERVICE

diesels

his feet up between shifts reading a porno mag Emily comes
running up to the door Pounds frantically on the glass

EMILY
Help me Please

The driver meets eyes with her through the door Keeps
reading Unimpressed More pounding from Emily

EMILY
Let me on

The driver points to the sign above the door OUT OF

Keeps reading Emily near hysterics at this point Margaret
closing in fast

EMILY
Shes coming Please

The driver sighs weighing his obligations Emily spins
back to the door Margaret nearly upon her ten feet away
five four

INT METRO BUS - NIGHT

The driver opens the door Emily dives backwards onto the
bus the door snapping closed in front of her just as
Margaret lunges for her throat

EMILY

BUS DRIVER
There - is - nobody - out - there

It sinks in the second time Emily scans the sidewalk the
darkened streets outside the bus Margaret is gone Was
never there The driver opens the door nods to her - out

EXT METRO BUS - NIGHT

With a hydraulic HISS the bus releases its brakes and
off down the empty street Emily stands alone Rain-soaked
Shivering Staring at her house down the block

The SILHOUETTE OF A CHILD in the window
INT CHILD SERVICES DEPARTMENT - NIGHT

Wayne and his BOYFRIEND shake rain off an umbrella as they
cross the darkened office

BOYFRIEND
(re the office space)
No I like it Its like those things

The boyfriend slows as they go past a cubicle Saw something
weird

WAYNE

He points Freaked Wayne comes over pokes his head ina
cubicle

EMILY
head down on her desk rain-soaked sleeping in her chair

WAYNE

over puts his hand on her shoulder

WAYNE

She awakens with a jolt Expecting to see Margaret She

looks terrible

WAYNE
Jesus - are you okay

She fumbles unconvincingly at some loose paperwork

WAYNE
to

You look like shit you need to see a
doctor

EMILY
I saw a doctor

WAYNE
What did they say

EMILY
(LOSES IT)
They said mind your own fucking business

Shocked by the outburst by her general appearance he walks
away muttering to his boyfriend Emily puts her head in her
hands pressing down at her temples Wayne steps into his
office in the bg and grabs something then they exit

And the office is quiet again Emily closes her eyes Just
then she hears -

A faint CYCLICAL SQUEAKING NOISE in the cubicle right next

hers Goes rigid Recognizes the sound Calls over the
partition without moving

EMILY
Wayne

No reply but the SQUEAKING CONTINUES Rising slowly from
her seat scared as hell she leans over her desk and peers
over the partition into the adjacent cubicle

Its empty But the OFFICE CHAIR IS TURNING as if someone
were just playing there

Emily steps slowly back And now hears the same CYCLICAL
SQUEAKING behind her The opposite row She spins

EXT CHILD SERVICES DEPARTMENT - NIGHT
Walks slowly from her cubicle Comes along the row of
darkened cubicles following the sound to its source This
is the one She looks in

Empty cubicle TURNING CHAIR

Emily backs away Terrified The chair winding slowly to a
stop
FLAT

forward

Suddenly behind her at the far end of the office a
different NOISE splits the silence Emily turns and stares
toward the sound The XEROX MACHINE Someone is using it

EMILY
Hello

No answer

Emily comes slowly down the aisle to the partitioned
workstation A torturous walk set to the RHYTHMIC CADENCE of
the photocopier the HARSH GREEN LIGHT SWEEPING ACROSS THE
CEILING ABOVE IT again and again and again

And then it stops ejecting one final page as Emily enters
the workstation And sees theres no one there

She stares at the idle machine for a moment then at the
STACK OF COPIES lying upsidedown in the tray She comes
over picks them up Turns them over

The first page is a photocopy of a PAIR OF HANDS PRESSED
AGAINST THE COPYING GLASS

Emily stares haunted Tense breath Continues through the
stack

Successive pages show the same two hands but leaning

into the inky blackness between them is a FACE its features
resolving into murky focus as it approaches the glass The
last page is a horrific image A man screaming in such
terror that his face appears almost deformed

Its DOUG The night of his death Like a snapshot from his
bathroom mirror

Emily shudders the stack of pages tumbling to the floor
Runs out And we see the photocopies lying on the floor
are totally BLANK

INT CORRIDOR CHILD SERVICES BUILDING - NIGHT

Emily leaving rushes down a corridor toward the lobby
Tense Head on a swivel Hears MORE SQUEAKING behind her
Spins

A NIGHT JANITOR WHEELING A MOP BUCKET

She walks on Turns the corner and RUNS INTO SOMEONE
UNEXPECTED Jumps back with a SHRIEK before she realizes who
it is

She shows Emily a custody form with an attached photo
A KIND HUSBAND AND WIFE WITH TWO YOUNG CHILDREN

Emilys face darkens

EMILY
(under her breath)
Oh God

ROBIN

Whats the matter

Emily stares at the unsuspecting family Lucys next
victims She fends off a wave of emotion as the full horror
of her predicament hits her Then matter-of-factly facing
that fear head-on

EMILY
I cant Im keeping her

As Emily walks off ripping the custody form to shreds
utterly confused
INT STATE PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - DAY

Emily sits opposite Edward Sheridan in the visiting room an
odd sense of camaraderie between them

EMILY
If I get rid of her if I put her into
the system

As Emily registers this
INT EMILYS HOUSE - NIGHT

Middle of the night the living room is lit by the eerie
glow
to

of the fish tank The filter humming The fish swimming
languidly Suddenly they DISPERSE spooked by something
outside the tank

INT EMILYS BEDROOM - NIGHT

The bureau has been pushed in front of the deadbolted door

form a barricade Emily lies in a fetal position on her bed
exhausted but unable to sleep

She tenses at the sound of a MUFFLED MALE VOICE in the other
room Comes over to the door trying to listen Thinks she
recognizes it

EMILY

(calls through door)
Mike
No reply

A moment of indecision then Emily tightens her grip on the
screwdriver and quietly slides open the deadbolts

INT HALLWAY - NIGHT

She comes slowly down the hall following the VOICE to its
source stops in the living room doorway haunted

INT LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
THE TELEVISION

Edwards psych interview playing to the empty room Hes
straightjacketed sedated Talking directly to the camera

EDWARD
Where is she now Some family somewhere

INTERVIEWER
Why does that concern you Edward

EDWARD
“Cause you have to warn them

Emily turns off the tv IMMEDIATELY IT SWITCHES ITSELF BACK
ON Emily freezes realizing the room is not empty
Turning she sees Lucy sitting in the shadows holding the
remote Lucy mutes the sound and returns Emilys stare
thoughtful almost empathetic
the

LUCY
I like it here I like you You want me
to like you dont you

Emily nods The room bathed in the tvs flickering blue
light Lucy is quiet for a moment Then in her innocently
menacing voice explains the rules

LUCY
You have to do what I say If I say I
want to go to group you have to do it
If I say I want a new dress you have to
do it If I say I want ice cream every
day after school you have to do it
Okay

Emily gives a haunted nod remembering
A FLASHCUT of Lucy sitting between Edward and Margaret at

Child Services meeting new dress ribbon in her hair
licking her ice cream with a wicked little smile

BACK TO SCENE

Lucy stares coldly at the television Margaret speaking with
the sound off

LUCY
They did what I said for a while and then
they stopped and started with the
secrets But they werent really secrets
I guess
(looks at Emily)
because I always knew what they were
thinking

She holds Emilys gaze then looks back at the tv Margarets
image reflected in the pupils of her eerie unblinking eyes

INT MARGARETS PADDED ROOM PSYCH HOSPITAL - NIGHT

Margaret straps unbuckled sits on the bed beside a YOUNG
NURSE who checks her temperature Done the Nurse heads out

MARGARET
Dont leave me

Terror in Margarets voice
line

his

YOUNG NURSE
Its okay Maggie Ill check on you
later

The Nurse exits Locks the door
CLICK-KA-THUNK The sound of doom to Margaret

She stands up looking around trembling at whats to come
Her footsteps sound oddly HOLLOW METALLIC on the floor

MARGARETS POV - surveying the room we see what Margarets
hell looks like Its not a room shes living in

AN OLD OVEN

With dark scorched metal walls A bolted-down bed to one
side perfectly white like a practical joke

We can hear the low HISS of it filling with gas The faint
POOF as it ignites beneath her The first SHIMMERING WAVES
OF HEAT rising up singeing her hair

Margaret runs screaming to the door claws at the pane of
glass like a madwoman But there is no escape from the hell
of her own mind The YOUNG NURSES FACE APPEARS there in the
window shocked by Margarets insane rantings

INT PSYCH HOSPITAL CAFETERIA - NIGHT

Edward dinner tray in hand going through the cafeteria
with other INSTITUTIONAL PATIENTS

He sits down at a table and starts eating quiet lost in

thoughts Takes another mouthful of food and suddenly stops
chewing noticing something very strange

A BALD MORBIDLY OBESE INMATE SITTING DIRECTLY ACROSS THE
TABLE IS CUTTING PEAS IN HALF ON HIS PLATE ABSENTLY BUT
WITH AN ALMOST SURGICAL PRECISON EATING THEM ONE BY ONE OFF
THE TIP OF HIS KNIFE

He lifts his gaze to Edward Smiles a knowing taunting
smile Then his WIDE WET MOUTH speaks in a little girls
VOICE

LUCYS VOICE
Im happy youre getting the help you
need daddy

Edward goes berserk Launches himself across the table at
the guy stabbing him in the neck with his fork Vicious

attack Unprovoked as far as anyone else is concerned A

guard rushes over Edward turns on him maniacal

THE GUARD SHOOTS HIM DEAD

As blood pools around Edwards body some LUNATIC who
witnessed the event starts to applaud Others join in Its
the most excitement theyve seen all year And as the

applause spreads through the entire cafeteria

EXT EMILYS HOUSE - DAY

Emily comes down the steps past the morning paper on the
walkway Stops dead in her tracks Stunned Comes back and

happily with other CHILDREN She meets Emilys gaze down the
length of the sidewalk Smiles and waves goodbye as she gets
on the school bus

INT BARRONS OFFICE POLICE STATION - DAY

Emily drops the newspaper on Barrons desk The headline
about Edward speaks for itself

BARRON
I know

Its a different Mike Barron than last we saw Gone is the
quiet assurance Whatever happened rocked him to the core
He closes the door for privacy

BARRON
Theres something I want you to hear
Came in at two oclock last night You
might wanna sit

Emily sits Barron cues a voicemail message on his phone

plays it over the speaker After a BEEP we hear it A

SINISTER MALE VOICE guttural taunting the voice of a
DEMON
SINISTER MALE VOICE
(mocking his earlier line)
“Its hard sometimes to tell the truth
but I know you will ‘cause youre a good
little girl

(THEN INTIMATE)
Twenty years in the trenches cant make
Lieutenant Hurts doesnt it Shakes
your faith sometimes You know why they
keep passing you over Do you Michael
“Cause youre soft Soft soft soft

DELIRIOUS LAUGHTER followed by a CLICK and a DIAL TONE
Emilys mouth gapes After a moment

BARRON
Youre right She called Doug Took me
an extra couple of days to get your cell
phone records Thats what shes been
using

Grim pause Emily digs through her bag Reaches the bottom
No cell phone Staring into the bag voice wavering with
EMOTION

EMILY
Shes taking me apart Mike

She loses it for a second Barron sits in front of her on
the edge of the desk

BARRON
Im gonna help you get to the bottom of
this

EMILY

(re Edwards photo)
He told me I have to kill her

Barron registers that in silence Stuns her and himself by
what he says next

BARRON
Ill help you

Emily looks at him Disbelief

BARRON
Whatever it takes
She hugs him A godsend
BARRON
Im gonna put Beth and Tim in a hotel
Keep her at the house

Musses the boys hair and leaves
INT HOTEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Barron strides down the corridor his face reflecting the
grim task ahead

INT HOTEL PARKING STRUCTURE - NIGHT

His footsteps echo in the parking structure as he walks
along
a row of parked cars

A faint JANGLING SOUND stops him dead in his tracks He
turns and scans the garage behind him Its quiet eerily
still

He continues onward but hears the faint JANGLING SOUND
again
a moment later Spins trying to place it There it is
again Closer this time Something moving hiding behind
the rows of cars over there

He bends trying to get a look under the cars Cant see

anything Unnerved he moves on clicks the button on his
keychain remote The lights flash on his car fifty yards

away

But as he continues toward it they reveal themselves

trodding into view from between the cars CHOKE-CHAIN
COLLARS

JANGLING around their necks

THREE PIT BULLS

Battle-scarred Vicious The dogs from Diegos house They

sit down right in front of Barrons car Its a surreal

moment a trio of attack dogs sitting at quiet attention

square-jawwed black-eyed the kinetic calm before a
predator

strikes

Barron draws his gun Fires a warning shot over their heads
BANG
Deafeningly loud it echoes through the garage like a

thunderclap But the dogs dont move just sit there
staring
of

Barron lowers his gun Its time to get the hell out of
here He backpedals making no sudden movements gun still
trained on the dogs

They watch him eyes livening with excitement one of their
back legs twitching in anticipation

Barron quickens his step and thats their cue

ALL AT ONCE WITH EXPLOSIVE SPEED THE DOGS SPRING INTO
MOTION VICIOUS AND MUSCLED AND SMELLING BLOOD

Barron fires an errant shot and takes off running But he
cant match their pace the deadly trio race along the row

police cruisers closing the gap with ease

At the last second Barron jumps the partition The pit bulls
crash skull-first into the concrete but continue their
pursuit unfazed as Barron takes off up the adjoining ramp

He jumps up onto the row of cars and runs across the hoods
denting the metal The dogs jump up behind him relentless
in their pursuit

Jaws snapping at his heels Barron takes to the car roofs

the pitbulls leaping from car to car behind him

He looks back just in time to see the dogs launch

themselves

They hit him at chest height sinking teeth in his flesh

Stumbling forward struggling to keep their jaws from his
throat Barron doesnt see whats coming The last car The
edge of the parking garage

Hes over the edge before he even understands flailing his
arms for a handhold that doesnt exist The ground far
below flies up at him in a rush of acceleration

We hear a sickening THUD and find Barron lying face down on
the pavement below blood pooling around him Clinging to
life he opens his eyes and sees the TRIO OF PIT BULLS
SITTING OBEDIENTLY BESIDE HIM unharmed watching

But from a distance we see there is only Barron Dying alone
between the parked cars No dogs anywhere in sight

INT EMILYS HOUSE - NIGHT
Emily opens the front door peers in trying not to make a
sound

EMILY
Lucy

No reply She enters Sees -

THE CLOSET DOOR IS OPEN

She comes closer

EMPTY BANKER BOXES strewn in the hall SCATTERED PAGES

At the far end the light is on in Lucys bedroom The door
open a crack A shaft of light spilling out into the
darkened hallway

Emily comes down the hallway past SCATTERED FILE PAGES
Preliminary reports Medical records Personality
profiles

She opens the door to Lucys room
INT LUCYS BEDROOM - NIGHT
Freezes in the doorway shocked by what lies before her

EMILY
Oh my God

Black eyes Bloody noses Bruises Cuts Burns PHOTOS
OF ABUSED CHILDREN COVER THE ENTIRE FLOOR A collage of
misery

Lucy is nowhere to be seen Emily comes in and starts
quickly picking them up

Tucked between the file cabinet and the wall is a CORKBOARD
Emily pulls it out Its covered with PHOTOS FROM WORK
COWORKERS HER KIDS Two of the photos are turned around
She flips them over in rapid succession Diego Doug

She rips all the photos from the board

Photos bunched in her hands she heads for the door but
hears something that stops her in her tracks -

A strange INTERMITTENT BUZZING NOISE
It lasts two seconds and stops She turns around scans the
room Puts down the stack of photos There it is again

BZZ2Z2Z22Z22Z22T BZZZZZ2ZZ2222Z2T

Sounds like a housefly trapped against a window but its
bigger angrier and appears to be coming from the

KNOTTED RUG
at the foot of Lucys bed Emily crosses to it The BUZZING
STOPS She bends Takes hold of a corner Peels it slowly
back to reveal

BARE FLOOR
Weird Nothing there
BZZZZZZ2Z22Z22Z2222T BZZZZZZ2Z2Z2Z22222T
Emily straightens turns Its coming from the

BED

As she approaches it the BUZZING INTENSIFIES louder more
agitated

Pauses as she gets there terrified of what she might find
the bed BUZZING FURIOUSLY FROM WITHIN Something is trapped
under those blankets waiting for release

Emily extends a trembling hand takes hold of the blankets
and slowly rigid with fear peels them back to reveal

BARE MATTRESS
Impossible because the BUZZING IS LOUDER THAN EVER
With a tense swallow Emily realizes its coming from lower
deeper within the bed between the mattress and the box
spring
She slips her fingers into the crack
And slowly lifts the mattress the BUZZING GROWING
FRIGHTENINGLY LOUD as its source is exposed something

hellish waiting for her as she cranes her neck and look to
see what lies below -
HER CELL PHONE

Vibrating BZZ2Z22Z2222T BZZZ2Z2Z2222Z2T On the viewscreen
INCOMING CALL

She picks it up Stares at it vibrating in her hand
Presses the TALK button Brings it to her ear

The LOW STATIC of an open line Then a RASPY MALE VOICE

MALE VOICE ON PHONE
Emily

Emily flinches

EMILY
Who is this

MALE VOICE ON PHONE
Its Wayne Emily I just got a call
Mikes dead

Emily stunned barely able to speak

EMILY
No hes

WAYNE (VO)
They dont know if he fell or what
happened

Emilys phone hand drops to her side in shock From down
there we hear Waynes voice

WAYNE (V0O)
Emily Emily are you okay

After a moment she lifts it

EMILY
I have to go

Hangs up On the brink of emotional collapse Her only
confidante dead

Just then she hears BREATHING from behind the open door
Someone or something hiding in that dark corner over there
She crosses to it Pulls back the door and there sits

LUCY
the

quiet innocent chin on her knees

EMILY
What did you do to him

Lucy says nothing Emily grabs her by the arm Yanks her to
her feet

EMILY
WHAT DID YOU DO TO HIM

After a moment

LUCY
He did it to himself

WHACK Emily slaps her Hard across the face Knocks her
to the floor Lucy sits up lip split Tastes the blood
with her tongue Hint of a smile The taste of victory

LUCY
Europa Ganymede Io Callisto The
moons of Jupiter We got back our
astronomy tests today

Its there on the floor A Well done Lucy

Theres a LOUD BEEP in the other room Lucy gets up and
walks out Emily watches as Lucy goes into the kitchen
Takes a bag of popcorn from the microwave Empties it into a
bowl Sits down on the living room sofa and clicks on the tv
remote watching it like nothing ever happened Emily walks
over and pitches the tv onto the floor The SCREEN SHATTERS

EMILY
Get out of my house

Lucy unimpressed expressionless takes another handful of
popcorn Chews it CRUNCH CRUNCH CRUNCH Emily swats
the bowl from her hands

EMILY
GET OUT
Flicking bits of popcorn off herself Lucy stands up from

sofa Her face catches the light from the hallway Emily
shudders at the sight
Lucys features look altered somehow sharpened Its
subtle but the overall effect is chilling THE FACE OF A
LITTLE GIRL LAID OVER THE MUSCULATURE OF SOMETHING MORE
DEVIOUS AND WICKED

LUCY

Dont yell at me My mom and dad used to

yell at me
Emily backs away mortified takes off down the hall
INT EMILYS BEDROOM - NIGHT

Rushes in Slams the door Bolts the deadbolts CLUNK
CLUNK CLUNK Moment of panic Will they hold

Slides her bureau in front of the door Shoves her bed in
front of the bureau just to be sure

In the silence we hear LUCYS FOOTSTEPS coming down the hall
toward the door

Closer closer

Theres nothing else to block the door with Emily backs
away trembling as

LUCYS FOOTSTEPS arrive at the door A tense silence Then

Lucy (0S)
Emily Im sorry I didnt mean to

Emily grabs the screwdriver clutches it in both hands

LUCY (0S)
Can I come in so we can talk and work it
out

Theres a GENTLE KNOCK on the door Emily flinches
remembering last time

LUCY (0S)
Emily

EMILY
Stay away from me

LUCY (0S)

Dont be mad I said I was sorry Ill
brush your hair for you
EMILY
STAY AWAY FROM ME

Silence

THEN
WHAM The door shudders from a MAMMOTH IMPACT Last time
it shook the door this time it shakes the entire wall

Emily recoils dropping the screwdriver

WHAM CRACKS APPEAR in the door as it bows from the
tremendous force

WHAM CRACKS FAN OUT into the plaster around the doorframe
WHAM Half the SCREWS HOLDING THE HINGES fly from the wall

WHAM The DEADBOLTS BENDING from the ungodly pummeling

WHAM The DEADBOLT SCREWS getting yanked from the wood

Emily frozen in terror watching Whatevers out there is
coming in

WHAM One of the DOOR HINGES rips clean from the wall
WHAM The FIRST DEADBOLT comes flying off

WHAM The SECOND DOOR HINGE gone

WHAM ANOTHER DEADBOLT flies off

WHAM The DOOR SPLITS down the center

WHAM The THIRD DEADBOLT lands on the floor at Emilys feet
with a METAL THUD

A breathless silence

Then the DOOR RATTLES and drops loose from the frame with a
DEAD WOODEN CLUNK

Nothing holding it in place now except the bureau and the
bed And now they both start to SLIDE BACKWARDS as whatever
is on the other side starts pushing its way in

Emily topples a high bookcase against the door and pushes
no

back with every ounce of strength she can muster but its

use The bureau overturns CRASHES to the floor Emilys
bare feet slide backwards along with the bed

And then they stop The barricade sufficiently breached

Emily in her panic makes a hasty decision She hides under
the bed

We HOLD LOW on the open door as LUCYS FEET step into the
room the feet of a child but the BREATHING we hear sounds
emphysemic and the VOICE is unquestionably male - harsh
guttural taunting Emily as it comes for her

SINISTER MALE VOICE
Emily

Wide-eyed with terror under the bed she watches those feet
pick their way over the shattered remnants of the barricade

SINISTER MALE VOICE
Emily We need to learn healthier ways
of resolving conflict Emily

The feet step gingerly past the overturned bureau

SINISTER MALE VOICE
Most families dont even know they
have a problem

The feet stop at the SCREWDRIVER

SINISTER MALE VOICE
»-until its too late

A HAND reaches down and picks it up a girls hand but the
fingers as they wrap tightly around the handle look strong
and sinewy

The feet stand motionless for a moment then turn and come
toward the bed stopping right in front of EMILYS HORRIFIED
FACE

A pause and then still from Emilys POV we see Lucy lower
herself onto her knees

WHAM - with shocking force that hand IMPALES THE
SCREWDRIVER IN THE WOODEN FLOOR

Another pause then both hands come into view palms flat on
the hardwood as she leans her head down

Emily recoiling in anticipation as the face comes into view

LUCYS INNOCENT FACE
A little girl With a little girl voice to match

LUCY

(PLAYING MOMMY)
What are you doing you silly
pump kinhead

Emily hyperventilating stares in shock Lucy reaches her
hand in Emily backs away wedges herself in the corner

LUCY

(PLAYING MOMMY)
You dont want me to come under there and
get you do you

Emily crying now shakes her head Lucy almost
sympathetic frowns

LUCY
(PLAYING MOMMY)

(PLAYING MOMMY)

Lucy starts crawling under the bed

LUCY
Here I come

Emily tries to go backwards but theres nowhere for her to
go
her

LUCYS FACE SLIDING CLOSER LIKE THE HEAD OF A SNAKE

Trapped Emily screams

EMILY
WHAT DO YOU WANT

Lucy stops crawling Folds her arms sets her chin on them
Comfortable here under the bed Delighting in the question

LUCY
What you wanted from your mother I want
you to love me

EMILY
Okay okay I will I will I promise

Lucy weighs Emilys surrender for a moment Then oddly
BRIGHT

LUCY
Come tuck me in

EMILY
Okay Ill be right there

LUCY
You better come

Lucy slithers out and we see her feet scamper from the room
Emily puts her head down on the floor and cries covering

mouth with her hands so she wont make a sound

INT EMILYS KITCHEN - NIGHT

A WHISTLING KETTLE on the stove

Emily still in tears takes it from the burner Dumps SIX
SLEEPING PILLS from the prescription bottle Crushes them
with the blunt edge of a knife Stirs them into a cup of

Chamomile tea

She freezes at a NOISE behind her Looks tensely over her
shoulder

The fridge

She adds sugar continues stirring
INT HALLWAY - NIGHT

We follow the TEA CUP in Emilys hand as she comes
nervously down the hall to Lucys room We can see Lucy in

Lucy considers this nods okay takes a sip of tea Emily
picks up a brush and brushes Lucys hair

bedside table Emily tucking her in gives the cup a
nervous glance Did she drink enough

Where are you if I need you

EMILY
Right down the hall

Lucys eyes shut Emily brushing her hair staring at the
HALF-FULL TEA CUP

INT HALLWAY - NIGHT

Lucy asleep in bed Emily watches from the door wary
expecting Lucys eyes to snap open any second

EMILY
Sweetheart

She doesnt move dead to the world Or is it a game Emily
closes the door Leans against the wall shaking
contemplating her next move

Wedges a chair under the door handle Time of the essence
INT EMILYS GARAGE - NIGHT

Junk-filled The door lifts to reveal Emily silhouetted
looking in Amid the clutter is a lawnmower Beside it a
big can of GASOLINE

INT EMILYS HOUSE - NIGHT

Emily stifling sobs as she douses the walls of the house
The hallway the bathroom the kitchen all of it

TIP OF A MATCH strikes flint ignites
Emily stares at it for a long moment

Lets it fall
FLAMES SCURRY in a shimmering blue-gold sheet across the
floor Climb the walls the entire house ablaze in a matter
of seconds

Emily sits and watches as the door to Lucys bedroom is
engulfed Its an image straight from hell A YOUNG WOMAN
SITTING ON A SOFA IN A HOUSE OF FIRE

The fish frantic in their tank catch Emilys eye She goes
over and grabs the tank

EXT EMILYS HOUSE - NIGHT

Smoke swirling past her she exits the house locking the
front door behind her She backs away and watches it burn
holding her fish tank the only thing she saved

TIME CUT TO

Billowing black smoke The house fully engulfed as fire
engines arriving on the scene sirens wailing Emily
watching with neighbors on the sidewalk as the FIREFIGHTERS
uncoil their hoses

The window to Lucys bedroom is a bright red square an
inferno And as Emily stares at it disbelieving what shes
done the figure of a CHILD appears

LUCY

Her whole body ablaze Horrific She just stands there
arms at her sides burning

Just now the FIRE MARSHALL crosses to the onlookers Hollers
over the noise and commotion

FIRE MARSHALL
Everybody get out okay

Emily wavers not sure what to say The Fire Marshall sees
her indecision

FIRE MARSHALL
This your house
(she nods yes)
Anybody else inside
(off her hesitation)
her

Emily opens her mouth to reply but sees something behind
that closes her throat

LUCY
standing on the sidewalk in her pajamas Unscathed

FIRE MARSHALL
Anyone else inside Yes or no

Emily in shock shakes her head no The Fire Marshall
rushes off walkie-talkie squawking Emily stands frozen as
Lucy comes through the crowd to her More dismayed than
angry

LUCY
That was mean

She takes Emilys hand Together they watch the house burn
Firelight playing on their faces The fish bouncing off the
glass in the tank at Emilys feet

INT EMILYS CAR - NIGHT

The blue halflight before dawn Emily and Lucy sit in the
Volvo eyeing the scorched remains of the house The
firecrew stowing equipment Emily puts the car in drive

INT EMILYS CAR - DAWN

The FISH FLOATING DEAD at the top of the tank in the back
seat as Emily drives down the freeway at daybreak Lucy
gazing out dreamily at the sunrise

LUCY
Maybe we can find a hotel with a swimming
pool

Emily says nothing Lucy turns and looks at her thoughtful
almost empathetic She draws up her knees and rests her chin
on top levels an appraising stare at Emily like the one she
leveled at Doug

LUCY
Its sad isnt it How it gets passed
on How people do to their own kids what
their parents did to them Thats why
you got the job
Emily turns on the radio full volume trying to drown out
Lucys voice Lucy reaches over and turns it off CLICK

LUCY
To prove to yourself youre not like
her that youre not like your mother
Because that scares you Scares you more
than anything

Lucy in mock sentiment puts her hand on Emilys

LUCY
I love you even if you dont love me

Emily looks at her gutted But defiant Turning her gaze
forward she tightens her grip on the wheel and calmly
resolutely JAMS THE GAS PEDAL TO THE FLOOR The
acceleration pitches Lucy backwards into her seat She sits
up eyes wide didnt see this coming A suicide run

LUCY
What are you doing Slow down

A tense smile from Lucy The tables have turned

LUCY
Did you hear me

Emily stares dead ahead red-lining the tachometer Lucy
flits her eyes skyward IMMEDIATELY IT DARKENS AND STARTS TO
RAIN Emily turns on the wipers speeds on unfazed

LUCY
I said slow down

Emily ignores her going eighty now weaving through SLOWER
TRAFFIC THAT FLIES TOWARD THEM OUT OF THE GRAY HAZE Lucy
panicking changes channels like a tv Innocent child all of
a sudden

LUCY
Please stop Emily Ill be good

Emily ignores her beyond apology And Lucys face sharpens
She points down the road

LUCY
Look out

Through the heavy rain we see -
with

death

A TRACTOR-TRAILER RIG CRASH THROUGH THE DIVIDING MEDIAN AND
JACKKNIFE BARRELING AT THEM HEAD-ON

Emily goes for the brake but reconsiders seeing the truck
for what it is a test of faith She welcomes it Tightens
her grip on the wheel and goes full throttle again right at
the truck Lucy shrieks in terror

LUCY
What are you doing

EMILY
Its not real

LUCY
Yes it is

EMILY
Are you scared

Pedal to the floor Inviting the head-on collision You can
see the BIG RIG DRIVER in the cab wrestling frantically

the steering wheel Lucy bracing herself screams -

LUCY
STOP

Emily clenches her teeth in anticipation of impact of

THE CHROME GRILLWORK OF THE TRUCK RUSHES TOWARD THEM IN THAT
FINAL MOMENT THE AIR HORN DEAFENINGLY LOUD

But the impact never comes In the blink of an eye the truck
is gone Open road in front of them Its not raining
Never was The wipers SQUEAKING on a dry windshield

Lucy sits in silence her bag of tricks empty Emily
triumphant turns to her with a vindictive smile the
speedometer hitting a hundred

EMILY
ARE YOU SCARED

She clutches Lucys wrist

EMILY
IM NOT
Emily jerks the car off the road crashing through the

guardrail Trees snapping in half across the hood as they go

careening through roadside woods and down a steep embankment
TOWARD -

EXT LOS ANGELES RESERVOIR - DAY

The car tears through a chainlink fence and leaps off the
high embankment into the water

INT EMILYS VOLVO - DAY

Impacts and sinks with frightening speed Water rushing in
from all sides Emily shackles Lucy with her arms as the
water rises to cover their mouths

UNDERWATER

They stare wide-eyed at one another through the water Hair
swirling around their faces as they sink to the bottom

LUCYS LIPS CURL INTO THAT CREEPY MANNISH SMILE

As though she anticipated this Or welcomes it Or knows
something Emily does not And now Emily sees what Lucy sees

A FIGURE SWIMMING DOWN TOWARD THEM THROUGH THE MURKY WATER

A HAND pries open the door and wrestles Lucy from Emilys
grasp Pulls her from the car swimming to the surface with
her Emily is left empty-handed stunned alone in her
watery grave

SHE DROWNS IN STAGES EACH ONE DIFFICULT TO WATCH THE
INITIAL FRANTIC FLAILINGS THE HOPELESS PANIC THE SLOW
DAWNING OF ACCEPTANCE THE MUSCLES LOOSENING ARMS FLOATING
LIMP EYES FIXED IN A BLANK STARE

And just when her death seems certain a HAND grabs her by
the shoulder and yanks her out the drivers side window

EXT BANK OF RESERVOIR - DAY

Ambulances Patrol cars Paramedics Onshore drying off
with a towel talking to a uniformed officer is the PASSERBY
who saved Lucys life

PASSERBY
Right through the guardrail never
touched the brakes

Emily goes by on a gurney semi-conscious oxygen mask over
her face Paramedics checking her vitals

Loaded into the ambulance she meets the gaze of Lucy who is
being attended to by a female PARAMEDIC who puts her arm
around Lucy in a maternal gesture shielding her from the
sight of Emily as Emily did of the Sheridans

PARAMEDIC
Dont look at her okay Just dont even
look

Lucy nods the innocent victim Clinging to her protector as
she watches the ambulance take Emily Jennings away
