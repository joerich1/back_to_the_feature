FADE IN

EXT TEXAS - DRAMATIC ANGLE - SUNSET 1

Out west where the sun descends gloriously over desolate
mountains A sense of timeless and incorruptible beauty
if you ignore the TWANG of the MUSIC the SPUTTER of the
TRACTOR the ZAPS the THWACKS and something else

MENS VOICES Garrulous with drink fraternity and
amusement

We PAN DOWN TO

EXT DRIVING RANGE - LATE DAY 2

A man JOSE is on the roof wrestling with a rickety
satellite dish stringing wire trying to get it to work
(We get glimpses of him throughout the scene as he
struggles with what is assuredly a pirate operation)

Four of six floodlights nailed to the roof cast pools of
yellow into the gathering darkness ROY TIN CUP McAVOY
stands under the swarm of moths crowding the brightest
light hitting golf balls THWOCK Launching them
really into the deepening night Theres a beer between
his legs Behind him

A group of men forms a semicircle facing away from Tin
Cup These men are the range regulars CURT CLINT
EARL and DEWEY Each man has money in one hand and his
preferred libation in the other Theyre all looking
back and forth between the bug lights hung on the back
wall and muttering what sounds like bets to

ROMEO POSAR -- a smaller man he stands at the center of
the group with a handful of cash Romeo is a part-time

bookie and full-time driving range man Born across the
river in Mexico Romeo is Tin Cups caddie confidante

best friend

ROMEO
Okay all bets are down

Their eyes rivet on the bug lights edgy hopeful
until ZAP A BUG is ELECTROCUTED And Dewey cheers
triumphantly while the other regulars mutter curses about
how they woulda coulda shoulda bet
A3

ROMEO
Number one is the winner Dewey
has the winner Pays five to two

Romeo quickly pays Dewey and more quickly takes money from
the losers Its fast-paced inane time-killing
gambling Tin Cup looks over

TIN CUP
Dont you shitheels ever get
bored

The regulars flap dismissive palms and mutter in the
negative as they turn back to Romeo and the action at the
bug lights

TIN CUP
-- ‘Cuz I got a riddle

Tin Cup leads the regulars inside

CUT TO

INT DRIVING RANGE - LATE DAY
Tin Cup holds court

TIN CUP
Takes about two ounces of brains
to figure it out Anyone think
they got a brain with two ounces
of brains in it

The regulars silently look at each other reluctant to
reveal the heft of their brains

TIN CUP
For Chrissakes boys A little
self-confidence from the players
gallery We aint talking long
division

EARL
(timidly)
How much we gotta lose

TIN CUP
You want to liven things up Earl
Thats a hell of an idea Say
everyone puts in twenty bucks and
the pot goes to whoever solves the
riddle

DEWEY
You going to get the riddle Tin
Cup

A3
TIN CUP

(patiently)
Dewey Im the one asking the
riddle I already know the
answer I dont getta guess
Although We could say if I get
to five hundred bounces and no one
gets the riddle I get the pot
And I know what youre thinking
Its an impossible riddle Well
Its not Its an easy riddle
And if somehow by the grace of
fluke luck I win and you all
dont agree it was an easy
riddle hell Ill refund your
money

EARL CLINT and ALL
Im in Were in Count us
in etc

TIN CUP

Okay a mans driving down the
road with his son and they get
in acrash Two ambulances come
and take the man and his son to
different hospitals Son goes
into the operating room the
doctor looks at him and says I
cant operate on this boy Hes
my son Hows that possible

(beat)
The clocks ticking boys

Tin Cup begins bouncing a ball on the face of his wedge

EARL
Father didnt sneak back in
right Hes still at the other
hospital

TIN CUP
It aint Star Trek Earl No
one beamed him aboard

That eliminates the most plausible theory in their minds
The men think harder

EARL
Well if the father married the
sons daughter --

TIN CUP
Its a family riddle Earl Think
clean thoughts
The regulars puzzle some more

CLINT
Give us a little hint

MOLLY (0S)
The doctors a woman

All heads turn to take in the arrival of

MOLLY GRISWOLD

Standing just inside the door -- shes a fresh-faced
beauty in her early thirties and shes got all new
everything the sport of golf requires new bag new
clubs new shoes new clothes new visor she looks
like she stepped out of an ad in Golf Digest And all
the men are asking themselves the same question whats
she doing here The silence invites Molly to supply the
riddles answer

MOLLY
The doctor is the sons mother
Feminists pose the riddle to
reveal how deeply our sexual
stereotypes run
(directly to Tin Cup)
I take it youre a feminist

Tin Cup misses the ball hes been bouncing breaking the
spell The regulars wait for Tin Cups response

TIN CUP
Maam Ive been called a lot of
things -- but no ones ever

saddled me with that one

MOLLY
You might try being saddled
sometime -- the smell of leather

the sting of a whip
The regulars snicker enjoying her one-upmanship

TIN CUP
(slightly taken
aback)
Im just a humble golf pro

MOLLY
Youre Roy McAvoy the golf pro I
pictured something different
I have a seven oclock lesson

TIN CUP
I thought I had a Doctor Griswold
at seven

They hurry out to the range Tin Cup oblivious to his
gaffe

And the regulars gather to look out the window --

THEIR POV - THROUGH WINDOW

To the range where Molly is stretching and Tin Cup is
discreetly waving to the regulars to get lost

CUT TO

EXT DRIVING RANGE - NIGHT

The lesson begins Tin Cup can be slightly condescending
in these situations though shes got him a little wary

TIN CUP
The first thing you gotta learn
about this game Doc is it aint
about hitting a little white ball
into some yonder hole Its about
inner demons and self-doubt and
human frailty and overcoming all
that crap So what kinda
doctord you say you were

MOLLY
Im a psychologist -- in laymans
terms call me a neo-Jungian post-
modern Freudian holistic
secularist

TIN CUP
Damn

She begins unpacking one of her bags pulling out every
golf gimmick on the market -- swing aid straps to pull
your elbows together a ball pendulum that hangs from
your hat a metal contraption for your feet etc

MOLLY
Inner demons and human frailty are
my lifes work I used to
practice in El Paso but Ive moved
here now

TIN CUP
Whatre those

MOLLY
I ordered these from the Golf
Channel
He stares in disbelief as she tries to wriggle into some
of this stuff Hes enchanted and dismayed

TIN CUP
That stuffs a waste of money

MOLLY
Im sure there are excesses and
repetitions here but I believe in
the gathering of knowledge and I
figured well there must be some
truths about the golf swing
illustrated by these devices --
and that youd help me sort
through it

She stands there with contraptions coming from every
limb

MOLLY
I have dozens of golf videotapes
too And a golf watch

TIN CUP
(irritated impatient)
Take it off All of it Now
Youre a smart woman for

Chrissakes -- dont you know the
work of charlatans when you see
it

She deposits all the golf gimmick devices in a pile

MOLLY

No I can always tell when
someone is lying to himself but
Im quite susceptible and
frequently wrong when that person
lies to me

(pointing to the

pile of devices)
That stuff cost me over 200
dollars --

TIN CUP
Then its 200 dollars of shit

He tees a ball hands Molly her driver and steps back

TIN CUP
Go ahead Take a swing

Molly takes a pitty-pat swing and whiffs and mutters
under her breath with the ease of a longshoreman
MOLLY
Aw fuck

TIN CUP
Well you talk like a golfer --

Molly unloads a mighty second swing The club head
bounces off the mat The ball sits untouched

MOLLY
Shit

TIN CUP
Fuck Shit these are

highly technical golf terms and
youre using them on your first
lesson -- this is promising

MOLLY
Awright wise ass show me

Tin Cup takes the club from Molly motions for her to
step back tees up a ball and rockets a drive into the
night

TIN CUP
Something like that

He hands her back the club and tees up another ball
Molly just looks at him

MOLLY
Impressive Yknow I tend to
process things verbally Can you
break down into words how you did

that
Tin Cup takes a deep breath -- this is his speech
TIN CUP
‘What is the golf swing -- by
Roy McAvoy

(beat)
The golf swing is a poem

TIN CUP (CONTD)
Sometimes a love sonnet and
sometimes a Homerian epic -- it is
organic and of a piece yet it
breaks down into elegant stanzas
and quatrains The critical
opening phrase of this song is the
grip in which the hands unite to
form a single unit by the simple
overlap of the smallest finger
(displays grip)
held lightly a conductors
baton

(starts swing)
Lowly and slowly the clubhead is
pulled back led into position
not by the hands but the body
which turns away from the target
shifting to the right side without
shifting balance Tempo is
everything perfection unobtainable
as the body coils now to the top
of the swing in profound equilibrium
And then a slight hesitation a nod
to the gods

MOLLY
A nod to the gods
TIN CUP
To the gods yes that he is

fallible As the weight shifts
back to the left pulled now by
powers inside the earth -- its
alive this swing a living
sculpture -- and down through
contact always down into terra
firma striking the ball crisply
-- with character -- a tuning

fork goes off in your heart your
balls -- such a pure feeling is
the well-struck golf shot -- And
then the follow through to finish
always on line -- The reverse C
of the Golden Bear the steelworkers
power and brawn of Carl Sandburgs
Arnold Palmer the da Vinci of
Hogan the unfinished symphony of
Roy McAvoy

MOLLY
What Whats unfinished

TIN CUP
I have a short follow through --
my swing can look unfinished

MOLLY
Why

TIN CUP

Some say its because thats the
best way to play through the winds
of West Texas and some say its
because I never finish anything
You can decide The point is every
finishing position is unique as if
that is the signature left to the
artist the warrior athlete who
finally and thereby has asserted
his oneness with and power over the
universe by willing a golf ball to
go where he wants and how and when
because that is what the golf swing
is about

(finally)
It is about gaining control of
your life and letting go at the
same time

Molly stares back exhausted and intrigued

MOLLY
Jeez Louise

TIN CUP
There is only one other acceptable
theory of how to hit a golf ball

MOLLY
Im afraid to ask Whats the
other theory

TIN CUP
Grip it and rip it

MOLLY
While I appreciate your poetic
sensibility Mr McAvoy --

TIN CUP
Call me Roy Molly

MOLLY
Call me Dr Griswold

MOLLY (CONTD)
Roy but at this point I think
Im more of the ‘grip it and rip
it school Hand me the driver

Tin Cup does She tees it up

TIN CUP

Waggle it Doc dont forget to
waggle

(as she stares at

him)
Waggle the club head

(shows her)

its a little relaxing

ritual

She waggles the club head then takes the club back
TIN CUP
Let the Big Dog eat

She stops lets the club fall

MOLLY
What Big Dog
TIN CUP
The driver the number one wood --
MOLLY
Its metal
TIN CUP
Yeah woods are metal -- dont
worry about it -- and the drivers

known as the Big Dog and Im just
saying to turn him loose let ‘er
rip let the Big Dog eat

MOLLY
Oh

She swings Tops the ball It goes ten feet

MOLLY
This is without a doubt the
stupidest silliest most idiotic
grotesquery masquerading as a game
that has ever been invented

TIN CUP
(cheerfully)
Yes maam thats why I love it
(beat)
And if you hit one good shot -- if
that tuning fork rings in your
loin -- you cant wait to get

back

She cracks one dead solid perfect out into the night It
felt great and she knows it

MOLLY
I think the Big Dog ate something
TIN CUP
Did the tuning fork ring in your
loin
MOLLY

I wouldnt go that far

TIN CUP
Always quit on a good shot Well
call that lesson number one
(confidentially)
and if ya wouldnt mind paying
me in cash -- theres a little
IRS situation Im dealing with

MOLLY
If youre such a legendary striker
of the golf ball as everyone says
then why are you at your age out
here in the middle of nowhere
operating a barely solvent
establishment ducking the IRS
collecting a few pathetic dollars
to buy your next sixpack -- when
youre capable of so much more

Her speech is delivered without judgement or rancor so
matter of factly that hes disarmed

TIN CUP
Perhaps Im chocked full of inner
demons
MOLLY
No youre chocked full of
bullshit --
(cheerily)

Same time next week
She heads off to the parking lot He stares

TIN CUP
What did you mean I should try
‘being saddled sometime

TIN CUP (CONTD)
Were you being literal or was that
some kind of Freudian type deal
Molly Doctor
(beat)
What kind of saddle

CLOSE ON MOLLY

As she walks into the West Texas night She smiles
enjoying Tin Cups confusion

Tin Cup just stares into the night holding his cash until
JOSES VOICE ECHOES down from the roof

JOSE
I got it Esta bien The flag
is up

CUT TO
INT DRIVING RANGE SHACK - NIGHT

Tin Cup enters cash in hand as the regulars all gather
excitedly around the TV monitor now coming in

TIN CUP
A class act there boys --
probably the first actual lady
type female ever seen on these
premises --

ROMEO
Shut up boss -- we got the Corpus
Christi dog track on the dish --

EARL
This is yer dead mortal cinch lock
bet with Do-reen

Everyones glued to the set A greyhound race comes on
from a remote Texas track on the gulf

TIN CUP
Free money boys what does
Doreen know about the fine art of
Greyhound breeding

ROMEO
All she knows is she likes the
three dog cause his name is
Pride of Odessa cause shes
from Odessa

TIN CUP
Get ready for Oddessa-lation boys
How deep we in

ROMEO
You gave her twenty to one --

EARL

toteboard --

TIN CUP

CLINT

ROMEO

TIN CUP

TIN CUP

(panicky)

Hundred

ROMEO

You said to shoot the wad

TIN CUP
I said get even Pod I didnt
say shoot the wad We better see
that three dog rolling on his ass

All eyes on the monitor -- the dogs break
EARL
Except if he breaks slow he

wont get creamed

The starting box opens -- THERE GOES THE RABBIT -- the
three dog breaks slow and trails down the front stretch
REGULARS
Three dogs dying TC easy
money (etc)

The one dog veers wide going into the escape turn
annihilating the field Dogs fly ass over teakettle
like bowling pins and --

REGULARS
Uh-oh

The three dog clears the pileup untouched hugging the
rail It has a ten length lead as it moves down the
backstretch and past the toteboard The race is over --
the three dog wins

Deathly silence Somebody flips OFF the TV Finally
in a lame attempt to lighten the moment Romeo speaks --

ROMEO
So Roy you were saying you
felt a little flutter for this
doctor lady

TIN CUP
Yes I was saying that just
before I was interrupted by
bankruptcy -- a development that
the Doctor Lady as you call her

will consider utterly predictable

CUT TO

EXT GOLDEN TASSEL NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

The marquee advertises EXOTIC DANCERSSTEAK 400 The
parking lot is full of pickup trucks and beer cans

Tin Cup and Romeo head toward the entrance

ROMEO
We lost everything boss We owe
Doreen twelve thousand bucks

TIN CUP
I think I been dating too many
big-haired blondes

ROMEO
Them big-haired blondes are a lot
smarter n us

TIN CUP
You underestimate me Romes

Romeo doesnt realize the truth in his own response

ROMEO

TURK (THE BOUNCER)

They enter the strip joint

CUT TO

As they pass the stage even the Naked Dancer interrupts
her moment with a bunch of guys offering dollar bills --

NAKED DANCER

And backstage they go easily waved through by another

bouncer They come up to a dressing room door

A voice from inside
VOICE (0S)
That better be you Roy

TIN CUP AND ROMEO

enter this holy of holies with complete familiarity
there she is -- DOREEN 35 at least the classic chesty

And

hippie big-wigged Texas goddess Shes older than the

other girls and more experienced in every way

Shes

smoking a cigarette and finishing up the touches on her

strippers outfit

Tin Cup and Romeo stand at her beckoning

TIN CUP
Doreen

ROMEO
Youre looking particularly
lovely this evening -- This is

nicer than the leopard suit --

DOREEN

Cut the horseshit guys So
the one and two dogs always run
wide and the three dog always
breaks slow so I figure theres
gonna be a big ol pile of fur at
the turn and the three dogs
gonna tiptoe around it and walk
on home I was right

(smiles )
You owe me twelve thousand
dollars

ROMEO
We going to pay you

And

Tin Cup squirms as Doreen babbles a bit

DOREEN
I know youre going to pay me

DOREEN (CONTD)
(admiring her own

outfit)
Yknow I finally got rid of the
leopard suit thing -- it was so
retro yknow its not easy
being a post-modern stripper
(beat)

So twelve big ones

Tin Cup finally digs into his coat pocket and produces
some official-looking papers He hands them to her

TIN CUP
There With equity and inventory
its worth twelve grand more or

less

Doreen leans forward to examine the papers She looks
Tin Cup with surprise

DOREEN
This is how you think you can
settle up By deeding me your
driving range

TIN CUP
Only on condition you dont sell
right away and men Romeo keep
our jobs

DOREEN
What in the world would I want
with your stupid driving range

TIN CUP
Equity inventory cash flow
not to mention an enhanced stature
in the community and prepaid
membership in the Salome Chamber
of Commerce

For a moment Doreen can only stare dumbly at Tin Cup
caught off guard by this unexpected turn of fortune
she starts to consider the idea more seriously

DOREEN
What are your labor costs
(off no response
from Tin Cup)
Payroll Roy What do you pay

at

Then

your help

TIN CUP
Lets see the tractor kid gets
five bucks an hour Romeo he
gets ten cash --

DOREEN
What do you pay yourself

TIN CUP
Myself

Doreen nods in a way Tin Cup finds threatening

DOREEN
To hit golf balls all day when
youre not breaking for beers or
corn dogs or to gather the guys
and lay bets on which crow flies
off the fence next

TIN CUP
Youre referring to my managerial
salary

DOREEN

Im referring to every nickel you

snatch out of the till and every

bag of beer nuts you lift from the

rack is what Im referring to
(beat)

Ill say its worth ten and you

still owe me two

She smiles he sighs

CUT TO

EXT PAWN SHOP - MORNING 11

the Winnebago)
You hocked your golf clubs

A13 INT WINNEBAGO - DAY
Tin Cup sits on the couch swigging Maalox

TIN CUP

parked nearby

DAVID SIMMS 38 looking every bit like the successful
tour pro he is Payne Stewart to Tin Cups Maynard G

SIMMS
Romeo Its been awhile Is
Tin Cup around

ROMEO

SIMMS
(unfazed)
Well you tell him Im in town for

ROMEO
You got a spot for Tin Cup I
thought you hated him

SIMMS
Romeo You wound me Im fond
of the guy going way back to our
days at University of Houston
when we won all those titles

together

ROMEO
He says he carried you on his
back

Simms wont be drawn into this adolescent competition --
hes too comfortable with himself and his success

SIMMS
I didnt have much craft back
then -- just a little native

ability Roys a great ball-
striker

ROMEO
Why you here

SIMMS
I want to win my own tournament
and he can help me if we can
manage to behave like grownups
together Tell him that

Tin Cup suddenly appears in the doorway

TIN CUP
Whats the catch

SIMMS
There is no catch I put together
a tournament with an elite field
and a half-million dollar purse
and Im tired of seeing all the
money head out of town

TIN CUP
Then make more birdies

SIMMS
I need you on my team

TIN CUP
You aint that friendly a guy

SIMMS
Were playing Cottonwood where you
once shot fifty-nine where you

fairway every subtle break on
every green --

TIN CUP
(warily)
You an me --
SIMMS
Me an you -- like the old days

Tin Cup cant quite believe this offer from his old
nemesis but there arent many options out there He
grabs Simmss hand and starts pumping it gushing
with enthusiasm

TIN CUP

SIMMS
No Roy I didnt mean I want you

Banners and galleries and concession tents create the
atmosphere of a polite circus

EXT COTTONWOOD GOLF COURSE CHARITY EVENT - 16TH GREEN

BILLY MAYFAIR putts out on the 16th green to polite
applause

EXT COTTONWOOD GOLF COURSE - 16TH TEE - DAY

The two twosomes tee off and the caddies follow
including Tin Cup

EXT COTTONWOOD - 16TH FAIRWAY - DAY

A leader board reads SIMMSSTADLER -10 MICKELSON
MCCORD -8

A giant gallery lines the fairway and rings the distant
green which is fronted by a lake as

STADLER hits a three wood toward the green -- the BALL
PLUNKS in the middle of the lake The GALLERY GROANS

Stadler just shrugs to Simms as if to say I thought I

had enough club

SIMMS
Like I told you it was moren
you had in the bag

STADLER
Yeah well I had to go for it
after your caddy said he could
get home from here

Simms swivels his head around to look at Tin Cup

TIN CUP
I could

Simms looks away at the shot hes facing a two hundred
fifteen yard carry over water He looks back at Tin Cup

shaking his head

SIMMS
I gotta hand it to you Roy For
fifteen holes youve seemed to
grasp the concept here Im
trying to win and your job is to
help me

Al5

B15

TIN CUP
Five percent of your earnings does
numb the gag reflex

SIMMS
Give me the seven iron Im
laying up

TIN CUP

You can make that shot

SIMMS
The smart plays to lay up

TIN CUP
These fans didnt pay thirty bucks
to watch a tour star lay up ona
short par five

SIMMS
Im sitting on a two shot lead
with three to go and my partners
in his pocket Suddenly pars a
good number Gimme the seven
Iron

TIN CUP
No way Youre going for the
green These fans paid good money
to see golf shots they cant hit
not golf shots they feel shitty
about themselves for having to
hit

Simms reaches for the seven iron Tin Cup clamps a hand
over the club

TIN CUP
Thirteen years on tour and youre
still a pussy Hit the fucking
one iron Dave

SIMMS
Thirteen years in a driving range
and you still think this games
about your testosterone count

Simms removes Tin Cups hand from the seven iron and
grabs the club stepping up to address the ball Tin Cup
mutters to the gallery

TIN CUP
Two-fifteen to carry and the tour
stars laying up

And the remark summons gallery voices suddenly urging
Simms to go for the green Simms motions for Tin Cup as

if reconsidering

SIMMS
But if youre gonna editorialize
do it on the other side of the
ropes I got no qualms about
firing your ass right here right
now

TIN CUP
Fire me Hell I should fire you

Simms steps back to his ball with the seven iron and

Stadlers still standing back where he hit the shot into 16
the lake MICKELSON and GARY McCORD the other team in

the pairing are there with him Romeo Stadlers caddie
stands just behind them

McCORD
(to Mickelson)
I know you could knock it on from
here Im just saying that caddies
been drinking muddy water if he
thinks he can

ROMEO
He can

All the players look at Romeo as

Simms dumps his seven iron shot safely down in front of
the water to a smattering of polite applause

Simms tosses the club back to his bag as Tin Cup
retrieves the divot And

STADLER
Hey Dave We in a hurry

Simms looks several yards back where Stadler is still
standing with McCord and Mickelson

STADLER
‘Cause I just bet McCord and
Mickelson that your caddie could
knock it on from here

SIMMS
Were trying to win a tournament
pardo

STADLER

I know But Im getting five to
one

EXT TV TOWER 17

The ANNOUNCER from the GOLF CHANNEL looks at the monitor
where a hand-held camera is picking up Stadler motioning
Tin Cup over

GOLF CHANNEL ANNOUNCER
From two-fifty from a snarly lie
over water on national TV with
no warmup Id give ten to one
to a tour pro

BACK TO COURSE 18

Stadler McCord and Mickelson are smiling at the bet

This is golf But Simms snarls at being challenged
Stadler drops a ball in the rough for Tin Cup to hit

STADLER
Here ya go Take a hack at it

SIMMS
Balls versus brains Roy You
hit that shot just keep walking
‘cuz your ass is fired

Tin Cup mulls over the warning as

STADLER McCORD MICKELSON
Come on Roy Your fans are
calling

Stadler waves his arms to summon a cheer from the gallery
Tin Cup puts down Simmss golf bag

TIN CUP
How you gonna fire me in front of
all these people Especially when
I knock it on the green

And he heads over to where Stadler and the others stand
waiting

PETER KOSTIS with a hand mike following the group

Peter Ive done a little
background here -- this unfolding

calls Tin Cup Locals claim he

he was a pretty good college lick

Tin Cup reaches for the bag The guy holds onto it
They wrestle briefly as Simms sighs with fatigue and
looks for a marshal

Tin Cup gives up wrestling when he sees a couple marshals
approaching He turns his anger on Simms

TIN CUP
What about my money

SIMMS

Romeo scoops balls into wire buckets from the garbage can

of water where the balls are washing Tin Cup sits on a
bench alternately swigging cheap whiskey and Maalox
TIN CUP
If I had it all to do over Id
still hit that shot

ROMEO
(nods with neither
rancor nor irony)
The look comes over your face you
would bury yourself alive to prove
you can handle a shovel

Tin Cup looks over at Romeo for signs of an implied
pejorative But Romeos just washing and scooping
balls and looking badly in need of perspective

TIN CUP
You know why Id still hit that
shot

Now Romeo looks over and he decides that Tin Cup is
the one in need of perspective

ROMEO
‘Cuz its the only way you can
beat David Simms Cuz you never
got over that he is on tour and
you are not Cuz you get that
look on your face

TIN CUP

No

(pauses adding

weight to his

thoughts)
Id hit it again because that shot
was a defining moment And when a
defining moment comes along you
define the moment or the moment
defines you I did not shrink
from the challenge I rose to it

Romeo nods holding his peace

ROMEO

Tin Cup cringes at the memory then moves for the high

TIN CUP
I was playing to win

ROMEO
A defining moment when you tried
to hit the same impossible cut

three wood into the wind from a
hilly lie -- four in a row out of
bounds -- until you finally pulled
it off and tapped in for a
thirteen

(beat)
When a twelve woulda got you on
the tour That was a defining
moment and the definition was
shit

TIN CUP
Greatness courts failure Romeo
Thats why most people in their
whole lives never ever reach for
the brass ring never know when to
dig deep and try for the
impossible shot

ROMEO
Youre right about that boss but
sometimes sometimes par is

good enough to win

He moves around behind her to reposition her shoulders

Not just the biggest golf
Tournament in the world the most
democratic

ROMEO
What do you mean

TIN CUP
I mean its open Anyones got a
shot at it You just gotta get
past a local and a sectional
qualifier and unlike Doral or
Colonial or the ATT they cant
keep you out They cant ask you
if youre a garbageman or a bean-
picker or a driving range pro
whose check is signed by a
stripper You qualify youre in

And then you pay out of your own
pocket to go there and get all
nervous and intimidated --

you Im gonna win the damn thing

ROMEO
You dont got the game

TIN CUP
I got every shot in the book

ROMEO
I said you dont got the game
The mental game The head game

TIN CUP
You suggesting I err on the side
of excess

ROMEO
You always go out to shoot zero
Sometimes you pull it off But
you cant play like that at the
Open You win by taking what the
course gives you You win by
being humble which you arent
and patient which you never will

be
Tin Cup comes over to the couch sits down and puts an

ball with an unorthodox chopping motion The ball pops
up in the air lands on the green releases and rolls up

you like to call your inner

transparent effort to do yourself
credit

You dont have any inner demons
What you have is inner crapola
inner debris -- garbage loose

you

TIN CUP
Not yet

MOLLY
Have you asked her out

TIN CUP
Shes seeing a guy I dont know
how serious it is but the guys a
real horses ass in my opinion

MOLLY
If you shared your heart with this
woman -- maybe asked her out to
dinner -- then it would force

these issues out in the open

TIN CUP
Im afraid shell say no

MOLLY
Ahh so what youre saying is
that all your speeches about
swimming across the shark infested
waters are really just about your
golf game -- not about your
personal life

TIN CUP
Christ I didnt know we were
gonna get into my personal life

MOLLY
This is therapy

TIN CUP
Well jeez I know but I didnt
think it was that kind of
therapy

MOLLY
What were you expecting Ann
Landers

TIN CUP
Yeah

MOLLY

Look its rather simple Those
risks that you love to take on the
golf course the risks you talk so
passionately and poetically about
-- you need to apply those risks
to your personal life with the
same passion

TIN CUP

I should ask this woman out
MOLLY

Yes
TIN CUP

I should risk coming right over
the top and snap-hooking it out of

Molly is stunned

MOLLY

From the moment I first saw you I
knew I was through with bar girls
and strippers and motorcycle
chicks and when you started
talking I was smitten and Im
smitten more every day I think
about you -- and the fact that
you know Im full of crapola
only makes you more attractive
to me because usually I can
bullshit people but I cant
bullshit you and in addition most
women Im thinking about how to get
into their pants from Day One but
with you Im just thinking about
how to get into your heart --

Molly was clue-less She just stares

swings and he tees it up As he does Romeo slips over
to Molly

ROMEO
(softly)
Looks like we partners Dr Molly

MOLLY
I just have to help him keep his
head on straight --

ROMEO
If you can you be the first

MOLLY
He does have the occasional
tendency towards self-destruction

it seems

ROMEO
It aint occasional and it aint
no tendency -- its a fact of life

that he gonna blow sky high its
just a matter of when and how
fast can the pieces be put back
together

(beat)
Behind that twinkle in his eyes is
nitroglycerin

Tin Cup waves and motions to his team

TIN CUP
Quiet in the gallery A mans
trying to do his job

And Tin Cup uncoils a mighty drive with an elegant
stroke fully confident and smooth The gallery
applauds

TIN CUP
(generally
announcing)
Got my A game with me today
folks youre in for a real
treat

Molly leans to Romeo just before they all head down the
fairway and confides --

MOLLY
I find him mildly attractive when
hes obnoxious and arrogant like
this --

ROMEO
Good Cause its his best
side

And they head down the fairway a scruffy little gallery
on a so-so course With a lot at stake

Tin Cups in a zone talking to himself full of himself
in a fabulous indomitable state of mind

Molly and Romeo keep looking at each other and shrugging
Tin Cups on a roll and needs no help So far

A couple of the regulars shout out encouragement

CLINTEARL
You the man Tin Cup You the

ROMEO
They bugging you boss -- I can
shut ‘em up

TIN CUP

The way Im swinging today
nothing bugs me -- except

insufficient applause
(surveying the
fairway)

Gimme the lumber

But Romeo is handing him a two iron

ROMEO
I think two irons safer

TIN CUP
I said I want the Big Dog

Romeo looks warily down the fairway of a tight dogleg
left par five

ROMEO
Tight par five out of bounds
left you dont want to hit

driver

TIN CUP
Im not going left of those trees
Im going over those trees with

a little draw That way I get
home in two That way Im putting
for eagle

ROMEO
You dont need eagle to qualify
You need to get used to playing
smart -- no mistakes wins the
Open

TIN CUP
Qualify I want the course
record Now gimme the lumber

Tin Cup reaches for the driver Romeo shifts the golf
bag beyond Tin Cups reach

ROMEO
You not going to listen to me
You dont care Im trying to help
You think Im full of shit

TIN CUP
I think Im gonna get penalized
for slow play if you dont give me
that fucking driver

ROMEO
You a head case boss always
were always will be

TIN CUP
Then lets ask the head doctor
Dr Griswold
(to Molly)
Dr Griswold should I hit the Big
Dog or the two

Suddenly an OFFICIAL steps forward

PGA OFFICIAL
Soliciting shot selection advice
is a two-stroke penalty

MOLLY
Trust your feelings Roy

TIN CUP
(to Romeo)
Ha Gimme the driver and shut up

Romeo pulls out the driver and he snaps it in half over
his knee He tosses the two halves on the ground near
Tin Cup

ROMEO
- Go ahead Hit the driver

Tin Cup looks at the two halves of his driver curbing
his anger not giving Romeo the satisfaction of a
reaction

TIN CUP
I changed my mind Gimme the
three wood

ROMEO
You cant clear the dogleg with a
three wood

TIN CUP
Wanna bet

Romeo pulls out the three wood snaps it over his knee
and tosses the halves on the ground next to the driver
halves Tin Cup turns with amusement to his playing

partners lest they think management has lost the upper
hand with labor

TIN CUP
Guess Im going with the safe
shot boys

Tin Cup reaches for the two iron studies it a moment
frowns and then

He snaps it over his knee He dumps these halves on the
ground with the halves of the driver and three wood

Romeo stares aghast Tin Cup merely shrugs

TIN CUP
Sometimes I fan that two iron
Better gimme the three

Romeo warily hands Tin Cup the three iron Tin Cup looks
at it frowns then

He snaps it over his knee and tosses it on the ground
Molly leans over to the regulars

MOLLY
Is this normal behavior for him

EARL
The word normal and him dont
collide in the same sentence too
often

She watches in amazement as --

TIN CUP
Sometimes I catch that three a
little thin

He drops the three iron halves with the other halves and
steps past Romeo and sequentially yanks all but the seven
iron from his bag

He snaps them over his knee one by one citing the
crimes of each club with mounting absurdity and ire

TIN CUP
And Ive hooked my four iron
snap
- and hit flyers with the
five
snap
and shanked the six
snap
and skulled the eight
snap
and fatted the nine
snap
and chili-dipped the wedge
snap
and bladed the sand wedge
snap then pauses
to reflect
contemptuously
on his putter)

and then theres Mister

Three-putt

He snaps the putter in half and dumps it in the pile of

broken clubs at his feet

Then he reaches for the last club in his bag the seven
iron The regulars hold their breath thinking this is
the end of Tin Cups Open bid But

Tin Cup smiles and caresses the seven iron
affectionately

TIN CUP
But the seven iron I never miss
the seven iron Its the only
truly safe club in my bag

He moves to the tee drops a ball and hits it down the
middle with the seven iron

TIN CUP
You happy Romeo

ROMEO
No boss Im tired my lifes
too short to spend it watching you
fall apart I done it too many
times

Romeo turns and starts walking away

TIN CUP

continues )

A toast is raised to their king and Tin Cup eats it up

TIN CUP
Thanks boys whatya think was my
best shot -- the seven iron on

bunker shot on eighteen which to
my recollection was a -- seven iron

Much laughter This is the Tin Cup they love

EARL
You definitely the man

TIN CUP
Howd I do Doc

MOLLY
(cheerfully)
You failed miserably

TIN CUP
What I parred the back nine
with a seven iron I qualified for
the regionals I --

MOLLY
Your job is not just to qualify
for the Open its to prepare for
the Open My job is to help you
prepare

TIN CUP
You said to trust my feelings

MOLLY
I didnt know you felt like
breaking all the clubs in your
bag

CLINT
He didnt break the seven

EARL
He smoked that seven brother --

MOLLY
From what I understand the US
Open is the most difficult golf
tournament in the world played
under the most difficult
circumstances with the greatest
players -- winning it means
controlling yourself managing
your emotions staying cool not
getting in a pissing contest with
your caddie who incidentally
quit

TIN CUP
He always quits he always comes
back

MOLLY
Nonetheless from the mental
aspect -- which is my domain --
you have regressed and are
fumbling somewhere between
delusion and denial

TIN CUP
Regression delusion denial
You gotta use all this
psychological language

MOLLY
Im a psychologist
Tin Cup turns to the regulars for support

VOICE (0S)
Have a bad day Roy

Everyone turns to see David Simms enter the conversation

MOLLY
Hi honey

TIN CUP
I shot 65 -- parred the backside
with a seven iron

SIMMS

(intrigued)

Why

MOLLY
Thats the question -- why

Silence

CLINT
‘Cause he broke all his other
clubs

EARL
Snapped em in two -- even the
putter

SIMMS
Jesus Roy Im on your side here
We go way back I hope you get

into the Open but if you dont
play under control youll get
slaughtered Good players shoot
82 in the Open You cant always
go for it

TIN CUP
Swear to God Doc this guy is
not who you think

CLINT
Its a well-known fact that if a
cameras not on him he treats old
people and children like dirt

EARL
And dogs

TIN CUP
Yeah dont forget the dogs

MOLLY
I think we should go David
SIMMS
I think so

Tin Cups worst characteristics flare up he wont let
go

TIN CUP
You ever shoot par with a seven
iron

SIMMS
It never occurred to me to try

(to Molly)

Cmon lets go The cars over
here

TIN CUP

Ill bet you a thousand dollars
against my car that I can beat you

in any game -- any game you name
it -- with a seven iron
SIMMS

This is ridiculous

TIN CUP
You a coward You gonna lay up
the way you did at the Masters
last year

REGULARS
(taunting like
children)
Chickie chickie chickie

Simms is a little drawn in not so much by the challenge
as the desire to shut up Tin Cup

SIMMS
Any game I name it

MOLLY
Oh come on David --

SIMMS
I just want to teach him a lesson

MOLLY
Why do men insist on measuring
their dicks

Tin Cup takes her literally and rises starting to
unbuckle his belt

TIN CUP
Awright awright Lets measure

right now

MOLLY
For God sakes I wasnt being
literal
(beat)
David lets go

SIMMS

Molly trust me on this one Call
it part of his mental preparation
for the Open where the rough is
deep the greens are slick and
the nerves are shattered

(to Tin Cup)
Ill take the bet

MOLLY
Oh jeez

The Regulars cheer -- this is what they live for Simms
hands a roll of cash to Molly Tin Cup hands her his car
keys

TIN CUP
Awright Whats the game

SIMMS
One swing each Who can hit the
longest seven iron --

TIN CUP
Its a lock I hit the seven like
John Daly hits a three

The Regulars whoop it up Their mans a cinch Tin Cup
pulls a ball from his pocket drops it right on the
ground in the middle of the patio

TIN CUP
From right here okay
SIMMS
Fine with me
MOLLY
You guys are really being
childish --
SIMMS
Molly leave this one to me
TIN CUP
Dr Griswold I know what Im

doing

Tin Cup takes a couple of swings to limber up aiming out

onto an open area of the course Serious intent the
look of eagles

TIN CUP
(to himself)
Dollar bills

He takes a full back-swing opens beautifully and
launches a seven iron like a rocket out toward some
driving range markers to oohs and ahhs from his
faithful

The ball lands at a 170 yard marker and bounces further

CLINT
Them signs are at least thirty
yards farther -- that ball musta
gone 220

TIN CUP
That balls about 2-2-7 toed it
a bit but itll do

REGULARS
Nearly 230 with a seven Pureed

Tin Cup hands Simms the seven iron

TIN CUP
Take a minute to limber up fine
with me --

SIMMS

Dont need to
Simms is still in a sport jacket slacks no golf shoes

TIN CUP
Take your jacket off

SIMMS
No no Im fine

Simms drops a ball about where Tin Cups sat He stands
above the ball and addresses it

TIN CUP
(cockily)
Youre gonna need to muscle up
big guy -- give it the old steroid
jerk

Simms is cool as ice He smiles then moves around to
the other side of the ball suddenly facing away from the
course This baffles everyone

REGULARS
What the hell you doin Whas
this

And David Simms hits an effortless seven iron out toward
the desert onto the lonely highway

and the ball bounces and bounces and bounces for
About three miles forever Its probably still going

COWBOY
When youre done with him can I
ask you about my club position at

Sammantha cant keep their attention either even though
shes down to a G-string inches away At the height of
the MUSIC she stops dancing and looks down at Doreen --

And Doreen heads to the dressing room disgusted but not

SAMMANTHA

Tin Cup shrugs She always has him outflanked

CLINT
Cmon Tin Cup were trying to
make you a presentation --

TIN CUP
Awright awright

She unwraps a tour golf bag -- Big gold and red lettering
advertises The Golden Tassel Pastie tassels hang from

Tin Cup surveys all the bizarre sponsorship loot and
starts loosening up These are his people after all

and theyre behind him all the way

TIN CUP
Look everybody this is great

DOREEN

Doreen and the regulars quietly slip away to leave Tin
Cup with his newly sponsored gifts and more importantly
his newly lost grip swing and confidence

ROMEO
You want me to stay boss

TIN CUP

INT WINNEBAGO - MORNING

Tin Cup stands there caught like a deer in the
headlights like a man caught cross dressing a private
confession made public -- he cant run and he cant
hide

Roy Tin Cup McAvoy is wearing every gimmick that Molly
first arrived with -- plus many more He wears a
pendulum cap his arms are strapped together a curious
triangular coat hanger type contraption connects his
elbows theres a neck brace an ankle anchor an arrow
attachment to his left hand a bucket for right foot he
swings a collapsible club and a BEGINNERS GOLF VIDEO
PROJECTS loudly from his VCR so loudly that he never
heard her knocking

MOLLY
My God

TIN CUP
Aarghh

MOLLY
Roy

TIN CUP

Dr Griswold
A moment of pathetic silence then
Molly starts laughing -- He is destroyed

TIN CUP
The therapist laughs at her
patient Is that how it works A
man is laid bare before God and
hes the butt of the cosmic joke

MOLLY
Im sorry I just

TIN CUP
Some of this shit might actually

work yknow I mean I think
theres something to this hat
with the pendulum golf ball
thing may be on to something
here

MOLLY
Oh Roy Jesus Quoting yourself
It is the paraphernalia for lost
and desperate souls

Tin Cup lets down The wind goes out of his sails and he
loses his defensiveness

TIN CUP

Well God damn a lost and
desperate soul stands before you

(beat)
I assume I have the
confidentiality of doctor-client
privilege in regards to this
outfit

MOLLY
Of course you do What happened

TIN CUP

MOLLY
Are you taking penicillin

TIN CUP
It cant be treated Its much
worse than whatever you thought it

MOLLY

TIN CUP

Look at me --

(considering what

that means)
Well not right at the moment --
but listen to me Youre with the
wrong guy Im the right guy
Everyone tells me my face is all
screwed up tight as a drum cause
Ive been crazy about you from
the day you showed up wearing
this stupid stuff and the whole
damn thing has both inspired
me to get here on the verge of
greatness yet its also caused
me to get the shanks which
could humiliate me in front of
a zillion people

(beat)
Such is life So dump that phony
bastard and come to the Open in my
corner -- you can delay your
romantic urges which I know are
lurking in there among the excess
of brain cells you possess --
until the appropriate time

(beat)
Tell me youre not at least
moderately attracted to me

Tin Cup stands there with the ball still dangling from
his hat the leather straps the bucket the arrows --
for the moment hes forgotten how stupid he looks

MOLLY
You have moments

TIN CUP
Tell me which ones are my moments
and Ill try to duplicate them

MOLLY

This is a moment You look great

MOLLY

Utterly exposed completely
vulnerable the inner child trying

Como esta amigo I have with me

Representing the great American
Southwest
The Guard backs off quickly turns to his SECOND

SECURITY GUARD

Do we have a McCormack on

ROMEO
McAvoy -- Roy McAvoy -- hes a

SECURITY GUARD

tournament Sorry

Romeo starts cursing in Spanish The Guard is unphased

SECURITY GUARD
Call the police

ROMEO
Police

The police quickly appear to take over the situation
Tin Cup leaps out of the Winnebago to argue his point

TIN CUP
Theres a mistake here fellas
A COP grabs Tin Cup and Roy is ready to fight Its
getting ugly real fast

COP
Well throw your ass in jail right
now pal -- theres a lotta
lunatics here and we dont take
chances

At that moment David Simms pulls in driving a con-
vertible sponsors car He sees the scuffle gets
out

SIMMS
Whats the problem here

SECURITY GUARD
This clown says hes in the
Open

Simms spots Tin Cup -- a delicious moment for him Tin
Cup wants to hide but he just gamely covers his face

TIN CUP
Hiya David nice sweater

SECURITY GUARD
Hes not on the list

Simms takes the clipboard with the list

SIMMS

Hiya Roy welcome to the big
leagues

Here ya go Charlie his names

They spelled your name wrong --
easy mistake with a total unknown

SECURITY GUARD

Let him in
Simms smiles at Tin Cup the easy smile of a man on top

Tin Cup doesnt respond just asks the Guard

TIN CUP
Which way to the practice range

As Tin Cup tries to regain some dignity and climbs back
into the Winnebago --

SECURITY GUARD
(to Simms )
He said he was a legend

SIMMS
Oh he is hes a very big name

They all have a good laugh and --

practice balls lying there on the tee

TIN CUP
Look at these balls Brand new
Titleists Lookit em every one

(lowers his voice)

Sneak a few in the bag when you
get a chance We swipe enough
free shit we might even pay for
this fiasco

Tin Cup limbers up trying not to be in awe of the real
legends who line the practice range hitting beautiful
shot after beautiful shot with graceful ease

ROMEO
You think it would be
inappropriate to ask Ray Floyd for
an autograph

TIN CUP
I think its a dead giveaway
Romes but if I still got the
shanks were gonna be found out
real fast

Tin Cup nudges a ball from the pile into address
position Romeo hands him a different club

ROMEO
Hit the seven iron You never
miss the seven
TIN CUP
Good thought Pods

Tin Cup waggles shakes limbers addresses

TIN CUP
Dollar bills

Simms has arrived and is watching Tin Cup with delight as
he loosens up

ROMEO

Tin Cup pretends to limber a little more before daring to
strike another ball

TIN CUP

If anyone was ever to make a run

in Open history Millers sixty-
three it would be today when the
rain has softened the greens
enabling the players to take dead
aim at the flags Still the
unswerving courage of an unknown
driving range pro from Salome has
raised that humble journeyman from
the ashes of an ignominious
eighty-three to wave a mighty fist
at the pantheon of golfs
immortals This man this Roy
McAvoy has laid siege to the
record book by birdieing the first
seven holes A brave par from the
water at eight and a glorious
birdie three at the daunting
twelfth another at thirteen

Tin Cup gets his read and steps up to putt

He surveys his options Behind him wearing a headset
McCord analyzes the situation for the TV viewers

chance to stage a jail-break is go
at the ball left-handed and hope
he can somehow snake it back into
the fairway and save par from
there

Tin Cup glares balefully back at McCord Then he walks

over to a nearby tree and surveys the line to the green
from it He walks back for his ball turns to McCord

eyes

TIN CUP
Fifty bucks says I knock it on
with a seven iron

And he selects the seven iron addresses the ball right-
and

He swings -- the ball rockets low off his club and
it ricochets off the trunk of a nearby tree and

it bounces up the fairway skitters past a trap and
trickles onto the green stopping ten feet from the pin

screams for it to stop
