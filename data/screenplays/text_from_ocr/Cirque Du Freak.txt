CIRQUE DU FREAK

Written by

Brian Helgeland

FADE IN
CLOSE ON a spectacular example of PEUCETIA VIRIDANS
Descending through mid-air on a silken thread Neon green
with black leopard spots on its legs A Green Lynx Spider
As we follow it down the threaded opening of a GLASS JAR
appears from the bottom of frame
Just before the spider continues inside the jar it stops
suspended Somethings not right It waves a leg
tentatively through the air

DARRENS VOICE
Come on Just a little lower
WIDEN TO REVEAL a Middle School TOILET STALL Standing on
the lid of the closed toilet holding the glass jar up over
his head is DARREN SHAN
Darren is 14 and a well-liked kid Tenacious Diligent
The spider just hangs there

DARREN
Come on Ill take good care of
you All the bugs you can eat

MIDDLE SCHOOL BOYS ROOM

The door bangs open and STEVE LEONARD enters Unlike Darren
Steves not so well-liked In fact he can be trouble
Maybe thats why theyre friends

STEVE
Hey Darren
No answer Steve walks along the stall scoots low so he can
see any feet in front of the bowls

STEVE
Did you fall in Darren

DARRENS VOICE
Shhh
Steve looks to the last stall sees the jar being held up
INTERCUT from in and outside of the stall

DARREN
Youre gonna scare him away

STEVE
Man were getting killed out
there Its three to nothing
Darren is all concentration as the spider drops a little

DARREN
Your problem Steve not mine
Steve gets a waggish idea Stepping to the sink pressing
his forefinger over the spigot he turns the faucet
WATER SHOOTS out in a stream which Steve directs into and
then over the stall door Reacting the spider zips up its
thread is lost in the darkened ceiling
The stall door opens Dripping water Darren stares at Steve
who flashes a wicked grin

CUT TO
EXT SCHOOL YARD - DAY

Kids eat lunch off in their groups On the field Darren
has a SOCCER BALL practically glued to his foot He dribbles
through defenders shoots SCORES Steve pumps a fist

STEVE
GOAL Three to one
The other team regroups starts back upfield with the ball
Darren steals it A few strides and WHUMP
Darren catches the goalie too far out The ball lofts just
over the backpedaling goalies head bounces into the goal

STEVE

(EXULTANT)
Three to two
Angry at himself the goalie KICKS the ball away It veers
off toward the street Steve takes it as a personal insult
STEVE
What does that prove Huh
The goalie blanches as Steve moves at him Kids are nervous
about Steve He likes to fight Darren gets between them

DARREN
Go get the ball Its 3 to 2
Lunchs almost over

STEVE
Thats why he kicked it To kill
time Well I still got time to
kick your face

DARREN

(BLOCKING HIM)
Forget it The ball
Steve decides heads after it The goalie gulps in relief

GOALIE
Thanks Darren Hes crazy
Darren watches after Steve He does have a vicious streak

THE STREET
Steve tracks down the ball which has rolled into the street
From seemingly out of nowhere
A gleaming black 1966 LINCOLN Continental Its tires sucking
at the asphalt as it rolls The windows blacked out
It speeds up reaching the ball Ba-Dump The ball BURSTS

STEVE
You idiot
The car SCREECHES to a stop idles ominously Suddenly Steve
doesnt seem so tough He looks nervously back to Darren
But as a WIND picks up the Lincoln suddenly tears off
A sheet of PAPER is kicked up by one of the car tires The
wind sends it sailing It drifts down until Steve
notices snatches it out of the air
Darren steps up beside him watches the Lincoln disappear
down the street Creepy
STEVE
Look at this
The paper is a FLYER A startling violent layout Beneath
a snarling WOLFS HEAD CIROUE DU FREAK - Human oddities and
other living curiosities Midnight Zeiterion Theater 20
- Admission is at the discretion of the proprietor

STEVE
-Human oddities and other living
curiosities

(TO DARREN)

Other Does that mean not human

Darren shrugs takes the flyer

DARREN
A freak show Ever been to one

STEVE

(GRINS)
Just this school
Darren turns the flyer over There are tire tracks on the
back They hear the sound of distant tire squeals but the
Lincoln is long out of view Just an empty street now

Cut TO

A BOA OCCIDENTALIS

Probing the confines of its glass prison A BOA CONSTRICTOR
by any other name Its a prison within a prison because
were inside

THE SCHOOL SCIENCE LAB - DAY
The teacher MR DALTON moves ponderously around the room
His voice like a metronome

MR DALTON

As you can see reptiles and

amphibians are not one in the same

As Mr Dalton continues we see various PAIRS OF STUDENTS
their computer screens showing text or pictures of various
pamphlet

FROGS ALLIGATORS and LIZARDS

DARREN and STEVE sit together staring at a Komodo Dragon
After Mr Dalton passes by Steve switches screen views
Hes done a WebSearch of Cirque du Freak There are a dozen
or so entries He picks one History of the Side Show
Under 1920s theres an older much more Victorian

for the Cirque du Freak A more ornate version of the same
Wolf Head The same notice from the proprietor
Steve spreads the flyer out to compare They whisper

STEVE
1923

DARREN
Must be a different one
Steve scrolls down through pictures

Sword swallower and glass eater OHIO GRAY

Frog boy AVERY CHILDS

Human skeleton JD COMBS and then

Egyptian Soothsayer LARTEN CREPSLEY Crepsleys gaze is
startling Like he can see through the screen even from
1923 Steve looks like hes just seen a ghost

Suddenly he hits print As a PRINTER against the wall
clicks to life Steve looks back at Darren

STEVE
I gotta show you something

CUT TO
EXT THE SHAN HOUSE - DAY
Picture perfect two stories dormers trellises 9-year-old
ANNIE rides up on her bike bookbag over her shoulder
Without stopping she hops off dumps it on the lawn by two
other bikes A few steps and shes through the door

Cut TO

INT DARRENS ROOM - DAY
Moody for the daytime Only the light from the half-closed
blinds streaking the floor where

Darren and Steve are huddled over several clippings and
pictures that Steve has spread out They all deal with
VAMPIRES in some form or another Steve pulls another stack
from his backpack spreads them out as well

DARREN
I dont get it

STEVE
Vampires Ive been studying them
Vampires Darren looks at him a beat

DARREN
Right Youre failing half your
classes at school but youre
studying vampires

STEVE
They been around 1000s of years
Two tribes They even fight wars

DARREN
What When

STEVE
Okay sometimes when humans fight
They fight at the same time And
no one knows it Like at the
Battle of Stalingrad they fought at
the same time the Russians and
Germans were fighting
Darren just looks at him wonders if hes serious

STEVE

Some people know about it There

have even been books written

He pulls a frayed old yellow hardcover from his bag

DARREN
fq

Thats your proof It smells
Steves really trying to convince him now

STEVE
ts everywhere if you look On
the internet in blogs newspapers
weird places But you can find it
The room starts to tighten a notch around them

STEVE
chatted online with one of them

DARREN
Come on

STEVE
Serious
We become aware of

A SINISTER POV
Someone watching Darren and Steve through the half open
doorway It moves in starts coming up from behind

DARREN
What was his name Mr Dracula
Mad now Steve opens the book flips pages finds an old
19th
Century painting He slaps down the science lab internet
print-out of Larten Crepsley Its the same guy Maybe

STEVE
Here he is in 1923 And here 1855
Huh Maybe hell be there tonight
Would that make you believe
As Darren looks them over the POV looms up behind them
Suddenly Darren spins
And ROARS at whats behind them his sister Annie She
SCREAMS in response Steve jumps a mile Darren LAUGHS

ANNIE
Howd you know
DARREN
Saw your shadow on the floor
Gotta try harder knucklehead
Steve snaps his book shut shoves it in his backpack

STEVE

Steve gets up stomps out of the room

At the same time Darrens MOTHER arrives home Coming in
through the kitchen door she sees the refrigerator door

Darrens mom exits as Steve pulls down two glasses starts

pour soda As he waits for the foam to settle he sees
The purse Just there A quick look around it doesnt take
him long to decide Steve steps over opens the purse

A quick rifling finds a wallet 200 in 20s He peels off
three bills shoves them in his pocket BLLEEEP

A cell phone starts going off in the purse Fumbling
frantic Steve stuffs the rest of the money back in the
wallet the wallet back in the purse closes the purse --
Darrens Mom is back in Shes hurrying to get to her
celiphone so

MOM

(INTO PHONE)

guilt in the air As she looks over at her purse

EXT DARRENS ROOM - NIGHT
The moonlight glinting off Darrens spider terrarium
Darren under the covers gets out of bed Fully dressed
Going to his door he listens Then he crosses to the
window Pulling out the screen he starts to climb out
CUT TO
EXT TRELLIS - SHAN HOUSE - NIGHT
Darren out his second floor bedroom window starts to climb

CUT TO
EXT UNION STREET - NIGHT

Part of a dilapidated mostly abandoned downtown Noirish
Darren and Steve hurry around a corner
STEVE
I came here after your house
There was a van there guy selling
tickets
(holds up tickets)
Rest is history
They cross toward the ornate albeit crumbling facade of the
ZEITERION THEATER Deserted except for a few CANDLES
burning on the sidewalk by a door The wind moans

DARREN
You know why they closed it right
Years ago a kid fell out of the
balcony and died Its haunted

Steve catches himself getting spooked He shoves Darren
STEVE

Get inside
CUT TO

INT ZEITERION LOBBY - NIGHT

Paint peeling The walls scribbled on Most of all - its
dark Darren and Steve head toward a glow coming from

A HALLWAY
They move toward a light at the end Darren pauses at a
darkened staircase Headed up He points it out to Steve

DARREN
The balcony Where he fell

VOICE

May I help you

They wheel around react to the sight behind them MR TALL
Gaunt but oozing an elegant toughness

STEVE
Were here to see the show
He takes an ominous step forward then holds out a hand
down

MR TALL
Ticket
Steve hands it over Mr Tall pockets it looks to Darren

MR TALL

Do you have your ticket Darren

Darren starts to hand it over hesitates The guy knew his
name Mr Tall reaches takes it

MR TALL
This way Were about to begin
Mr Tall turns on his heel and strides off As they follow

DARREN

(LOW)
He knew my name

STEVE
Maybe he heard me say it

Mr Tall turns a corner only steps ahead of them But

AROUND CORNER
When they turn it Mr Tall is gone Vanished Ahead a
threadbare velvet CURTAIN A low murmur on the other side
The boys exchange a last look then push through into

THE ZEITERION THEATER

Mouldings removed cherubs gouged from the walls of a once
proud theater Rows of seats are missing as well Those
that remain are filled The crowd seems nervous watching
the empty stage expectantly Yearning for something special
No sign of Mr Tall Darren and Steve stand at the top of
the aisle The only kids here Somewhere off stage a
TRUMPET sounds and with it a stage light goes out

Steve nudges Darren points out two empty seats halfway

As they move for them a second trumpet sounds and a second
stage light goes out

And so on By the time Darren and Steve take their seats
the theater has gone black A final flourish from the
center

ROAR

the

trumpets and all is silent
Then a dull green light glows across the stage Before it
was empty now there is a CAGE set on wheels in the

Theres the scraping of chain A low guttural sound

A white spot shines down leaves the front half of the cage
in light the back half in shadow A FIGURE moves in there
The AUDIENCE lean forward hoping to see when theres a

Several people SCREAM as the figure CRASHES to the front of
the cage A WOLFMAN for lack of a better term its body
covered in thick matted hair It roars again shakes the
bars Its half-canine teeth yellow its eyes red A chain
hangs attached to an iron collar around its neck

Half the audience believe its real The other half are
amazed at how real this performer seems As they buzz Mr
Tall steps out on stage Wearing red leather gloves and hat

MR TALL

Ladies and Gentlemen Welcome to
the Cirque du Freak We are an
ancient circus We have toured for
five hundred years

Darren and Steve exchange a look at this information

MR TALL

-Bringing the remarkable and

grotesque to generations Our

freaks are not people in masks

They are not harmless misfits

What you see tonight is real Each

performer unique None harmless

To prove this the Wolfman lunges reaches a claw through

bars to swipe just centimeters short of Mr Tall whos non-
reaction shows he knows exactly where hes standing

A ripple goes through the crowd as they become aware of
TRUSKA Startlingly beautiful Dressed for the Moulin
Rouge Crossing the stage in a languid catwalk Several MEN
in the audience begin to cough and shift in their seats
Even the Wolfman takes notice
upper

and

MR TALL
Beauty and the beast
Truska approaches the cage makes soothing motions her

body swaying The Wolfman lulls to a trance

Two stage hands - MIDGETS apparently hidden by blue robes
step out and start to push the cage off stage

Truska steps toward the audience moving in the same
languorous rhythm And then she begins to grow a BEARD
Hairs creeping from above her lip curling from her chin
Some in the audience recoil

Darren and Steve trade grins This is great Then

From either wing of the stage come twin contortionists SIVE
and SERSA They walk on their hands their legs pulled back
with their ankles cinched behind there necks
As Truska exits Sive and Sersa meet in the middle Like
Hindu wrestlers they take turns climbing up and down each
other look like one person with two fronts They twist like
pretzels getting huge LAUGHS when they pretend to be stuck
As it goes on RHAMUS TWOBELLIES pads out to watch The
floorboards creak under his feet He must weigh 600 pounds
After a moment he turns walks toward the audience The
light leaves the contortionists and focuses on Rhamus

RHAMUS
My name is Rhamus Twobellies And
I do have two
He TRIPS stumbles toward the edge of the stage PEOPLE in
the front row jump back to keep from being crushed Rhamus
stops short LAUGHS at them He was pretending Hes
practically doubled-over resting his hands on his haunches
More blue-robed MIDGETS roll out a CART covered with food

lots of other stuff Rhamus grabs a GLASS BOTTLE of soda
Instead of opening it he bites off the glass top chews it
and swallows Soon hes eating food almost as fast as he can
grab it Disgusting but great fun at the same time

Next he holds up a couple of nuts and bolts Then swallows
them whole He swings his belly around You can hear the
sound of metal shifting inside

The crowd recoils as he starts to regurgitate spitting out
BOLTS NAILS BOTTLE CAPS a JACKKNIFE They clatter on
stage Finally a METAL LINK appears between his teeth

He pinches hold of it and pulls A CHAIN starts out of his
mouth up from his belly One foottwosix feet in all
With a shrug he starts off stage dragging it behind him
Darren and Steve break into applause So does the audience
As Rhamus chain slides out of sight a SNAKE slides in An
enormous BOA CONSTRICTOR Impossibly huge It slithers out
to the center of the stage its tongue flicking in and out
A SPOTLIGHT flicks down from above The snake stops raises
itself several feet off the ground as it looks up seemingly
transfixed by the light But in reality

The end of a thick ROPE drops down And moving (headfirst)
down the rope is a BOY Very thin his blonde hair tinged
with green This is EVRA VON He moves smoothly twists
over backwards to set his feet down on the stage

Evra wears a sort of cloak which he suddenly spins out of
The audience GASPS Wearing only shorts Evras body
SPARKLES Hes covered in gold blue and green scales

He moves a vaguely webbed hand through the air charming the
snake which raises itself higher still He slowly slides
forward till he and the boa are nearly eye-to-eye

Then Evra leans forward and KISSES the snake on the nose

DARREN and STEVE

DARREN
Hes as old as us

STAGE
Evra starts to make a HISSING sound In response the snake
begins corkscrewing around him like the stripes on a barber
shop pole Finally it slithers around his neck pulls back
to look him in the eye And then
Evra bends at the knees lays down and starts to roll Like
he was wrapped in a snake carpet he disappears stage left
More applause from the audience
Then the stage goes dark except for a small focused spot at
the center Everyone waits but nothing happens until
Appearing literally out of nowhere - one instant theres
nothing under the spot and the next instant there is --

LARTEN CREPSLEY
through

Motionless looking past the crowd The only difference from
his pictures is hes a bit older and a SCAR runs down his
left cheek It stretches his mouth up on that side

DARREN and STEVE
Recognize him Cant believe their eyes Steve pulls the
print-out from his pocket compares

DARREN
Its him

STAGE
Crepsley disappears The crowd mumble nervously And just
as suddenly hes back On the edge of the stage lit by the
footlights This time he holds a draped BIRDCAGE

CREPSLEY
Its not true That all tarantulas
are poisonous Though some can
kill a man With one bite
Crepsley whisks off the covering In the cage a TARANTULA
the size of a large mans hand So big you can make out
individual eyes As deadly looking as it is beautiful

DARREN
Reacts A spider

STAGE
Crepsley makes the introduction

CREPSLEY
Her name Madam Octa Pray that
she never learns yours
Two of the blue-robed little people lead a GOAT onto the
stage A ripple of worry runs through the crowd Crepsley
starts over The goat BLEATS The little people hold it
Mr Crepsley flicks open the cage door with his finger The
spider sets its front legs on the bars pulls itself

A few gasps from the audience The goat bucks
Madam Octa bares her fangs poised to leap on her prey
Several audience members CRY OUT that this should stop
Crepsley looks out with mock-theatrical surprise

CREPSLEY
No Shall it be life
Chuckling to himself he looks to the goat tenders They
release the goat which bee-lines its way off the stage
Crepsley faces the audience

CREPSLEY
I wonder if you would be as shocked
to see the same fate for me
Madam Octa moves -- climbing the outside of the cage --
taking a cautious step onto the hand holding the cage then
starting up Crepsleys arm He stands dead still

DARREN and STEVE
Have a million questions but right now the performance has
their full edge-of-their-seat attention

STAGE
Madam Octa has nearly reached Crepsleys left shoulder

CREPSLEY
Though we have been together such a
long time she is no pet I think
she would quite enjoy killing me
Crepsley calmly raises his free hand It holds a shiny TIN
WHISTLE Madam Octa has reaches his shoulder

CREPSLEY
For her bite there is no cure
Madam Octa bares her fangs even longer now Her malevolence
about to be directed at her master
Crepsley carefully puts the whistle to his mouth and starts
to play as simple as it is evocative
Madam Octa hesitates Then she moves around his throat
starts to climb his face using his scar as her guide She
gets to the top of his head stands in his shock of hair
She sways shes dancing
Then she leaps lands on the end of the whistle Crepsley
keeps playing as Madam Octa attaches a web drops down about
18 inches off the end She starts to swing
Crepsley takes the whistle from his mouth and twirls it
around Octa does a few 360s and the thread breaks She
sails up high over Crepsleys head

He cranes back to watch as down she comes legs splayed She
lands flat on his face The whistle is in his hand

Crepsley looks out at the audience Looking out between her
hairy legs his eyes are wide with horror

Without warning the spotlight on him goes out As the stage
is plunged into darkness we hear Crepsley SCREAM

A horrible horrible sound The audience wait but nothing
happens Some of them rise from their seats peer into the
gloom Its too dark

The sound of something being DRAGGED Then nothing A light
comes up stage left as Mr Tall steps out

MR TALL
Thank you ladies and gentlemen
That is the end of our show

AUDIENCE MAN
But What happened to him

MR TALL

Dont you know What happens to us

all can happen to any of us

That said theres a crack of thunder and an explosion
seemingly at Mr Talls feet Hes nowhere to be seen

The houselights come up The stage is empty Some in the
audience start to clap Others are a bit dismayed

Darren and Steve sit there as people start for the exits

DARREN
Lets get outta here

STEVE
No you go Im staying
Steve starts down toward the stage Darren follows

DARREN
Wait Whatre you doing
Steve reaches the stage looks around The audience is
mostly exited no one from the Cirque is in sight
shoulder

As Steve starts up onto the stage Darren grabs his
Steve wheels shoves Darren who stumbles back into a seat

STEVE
This is my destiny Dont ruin it
Steve looks dangerous as he looms Darren raises his hands
in surrender Steve eases off but hes still intense

STEVE
That car today It was a sign
Sending me here I was told
thered be a sign
Too friggin weird

DARREN
Told by who The guy in the chat
room The internet guy

STEVE
ll tell you later If I can
Steve scrambles onto the stage and disappears into the back
Darren stands whispers into the dark

DARREN
Steve
Decision time Darren climbs up starts after his friend

Cut TO

INT ZEITERION THEATER - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT

Darren moves back into the gloom Deserted the junk casts
sinister shadows Then a sound at his feet Darren stops
short Sees that hes almost walked into an open stage DOOR
IN THE FLOOR The sound is someone moving below

DARREN
Steve
No answer Darren decides starts down steep rickety steps

Cut TO

STEVE - UNDERSTAGE STORAGE AREA
He moves past a dilapidated stage elevator Stumbles As he
heads further into the dark

DARREN
Coming down the creaky stairs Spooky

DARREN
Steve

Cut TO

STEVE
Turning a corner is startled by what turns out to be a
costume mannequin But beyond a LONG BOX set on two
sawhorses Coffin-sized Empty its lid propped up by it
The dust is tracked with footsteps A mini-FRIDGE hums ina
corner Steve steps over sees an EXTENSION CORD which runs
up the wall disappears into a hole punched in the ceiling

DARREN
Stops short as a LIGHT suddenly cuts through the gloom to

left Darren steps over low behind a CREDENZA He sees

STEVE
Hes opened the door to the fridge The little bulb inside
pushes through the gloom lighting the area up

DARREN
Reacts as MADAM OCTA tries to jump on his face The bars of
her CAGE stop her It rests on the credenza he crouches
behind The whistle is there too Darren looks over as

STEVE
Reaches in the fridge takes out a glass jar that looks to

filled with BLOOD Steve raises it swirls it around inside

CREPSLEYS VOICE
Are you looking for me
Steve whirls -- drops the bottle -- SMASH
Standing behind him - dead still - CREPSLEY

DARREN
Rooted to the spot Watching

STEVE and CREPSLEY
Crespley sniffs the air - the spilled blood to be exact

STEVE
I -- I know who you are

CREPSLEY
Tell me boy Who am I

STEVE
Youre a vampire

CREPSLEY
Too broad a definition Do you
introduce yourself as a human Who
I am is Larten Crepsley

DARREN
Moving slightly to get a clearer view

STEVE and CREPSLEY
Crepsley suddenly DISAPPEARS REAPPEARS much closer Steve
jumps twists around Unnerved

CREPSLEY
Who sent you and what do they want

STEVE
Nothing No one

Crepsley takes a moment to decide if he believes him

CREPSLEY
Then what do you want

STEVE
I want to join you
CREPSLEY
Join me I dont understand

STEVE
I want you to make me a vampire
Not what Crepsley (or Darren) expected Steve stands there
trying to look resolved Crepsley is surprised intrigued

CREPSLEY
Is it because you want to live
forever Because we dont

STEVE
I dont care about living forever
But you do seem to live a long
time

CREPSLEY
A long time alone Do you want to
live alone

STEVE
I already do

CREPSLEY
Are you an orphan

STEVE
My fathers gone my mother doesnt
care about me

CREPSLEY
Nor mine Youre friendless also

STEVE
I have a friend but he doesnt
understand Hes got too much to
know what its like to be alone
As Darren reacts to this

STEVE
When youre alone you feel weak
Useless But I know there must be
something strong about it too I
want to feel the power of being
alone I want to be a vampire

CREPSLEY
The power of being alone will never
be greater than the weakness of it

STEVE
I dont care
Crepsleys actually impressed but after a moment he waves a
dismissive hand

CREPSLEY
It makes no matter We do not
blood children Im sorry
Steve pulls a JACKKNIFE from his pocket flips open the 2-
inch blade Crepsley laughs out loud

CREPSLEY
Do you intend to use that on me
And we feel it more than see it but Steve cuts into his own
palm He holds it up moist and red in Crepsleys face

STEVE
Do it Make me a vampire

CREPSLEY
Do not tempt me

DARREN
Cant believe what hes watching He sees Crepsley suddenly
get scent of something Something to do with Steves
blood Not quite a clear view as Crepsley grabs Steves
wrist dabs a finger into his palm and then tastes it

CREPSLEY
Crepsley shoves Steve down to the ground and immediately
begins spitting onto the floor Like it was poison

STEVE
Whats wrong

CREPSLEY
You have bad blood

STEVE
What do you mean
holds

CREPSLEY
I can taste the menace in your
blood You can never be a vampire
Youre evil
Steve scrambles to his feet

STEVE
Thats a lie You take that back
Crepsley draws himself full his voice deadly

CREPSLEY
Go home
Suddenly cowed Steve just stands there blinking

CREPSLEY

Go
Steve runs disappears into the gloom After a moment we
can hear him scurrying up the stairs Then hes gone

DARREN
Frozen to his spot watches as Crepsley seemingly ill

his head and spits again onto the floor Then he steps over
and kicks the fridge door closed

And in the blink of an eye hes gone Disappeared

Darren is alone He starts out then stops Looks back
That beautiful spider And Darren takes Madam Octas cage
and the whistle and makes a run for it Just like that

CUT TO
EXT STREETS - DARRENS NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT

3 AM Dead quiet Darren hurries home cage in hand

Looking over his shoulder So far so good He nearly trips
over an untied shoelace He sets down the cage to tie it
Madam Octa lunges across her cage at a WORM on the sidewalk

DARREN
Oh You want that
Darren picks up the worm lowers it between the bars A beat
and then Madam Octa snatches it away from him Dinner

DARREN
See Im your friend Youre so
beautiful I stopped thinking
The wind rustles Darren grabs the cage continues

CUT TO
EXT THE SHAN HOUSE - NIGHT

The house dark Holding the cage with one hand Darren
starts climbing the side of the house using the other He
avoids the broken section but as he reaches the window
His Dad is standing there looking out Busted

DAD
Get inside
From his angle Darrens Dad cant see the cage in his sons
hand Darren hooks it over the end piece of part of the
trellis and climbs in Leaving the cage hanging behind

DARREN

new species or its a fake photo

CREPSLEY

What have you come for this time

Darren pulls out a CRUCIFIX holds it in Crepsleys face
The vampire takes it looks it over It has no effect

DARREN
Crosses dont hurt you

CREPSLEY
Why should they

DARREN
Because youre evil

CREPSLEY
Am I Are vampire bats evil when
they drink the blood of cows

DARREN
Thats different Bats are animals

CREPSLEY

Why are you here

DARREN

Crepsley shrugs tosses Darren back his crucifix

DARREN
Hes dying

CREPSLEY
Yes well boys who play with
things they do not understand can
hardly complain if --

DARREN
You have to help him

years Whatever it costs

Money doesnt interest me

DARREN
Theres something you want Thats

Right
Crepsleys surprised and pleased by Darrens intuitiveness

CREPSLEY
The night Steve came below to speak
to me you were there Did you
hear what we talked about

DARREN
He wanted to become like you

CREPSLEY

You dont just become a vampire
The change is too extreme And if
the shock didnt kill you your
inexperience would So you become
one in stages A half-vampire at
first With greater strength than
a human but still able to go out
in sunlight You learn froma full
vampire Do you understand

DARREN
I think so

CREPSLEY
But your friend has bad blood
Hes no good Theres no telling
what hell become as he matures

DARREN
I dont believe that someone can
have bad blood

CREPSLEY
And yesterday you didnt believe in
vampires Regardless Ive left

Crepsley nods
DARREN
Youre crazy Theres no way

CREPSLEY
Then your friend will die
The words hang in the air Crepsley smiles

CREPSLEY
You hardly have a choice Its

DARREN
Destiny That doesnt make sense

CREPSLEY
Try this then Youre reckless
enough to steal responsible enough
to come back for a friend Thats
enough for me

DARREN

Yes well destiny cant be
explained It must be lived Now

DARREN
Theres gotta be another way

Life or death Yes or no
DARREN
Youd never be able to trust me
If I got a chance for payback Id

CREPSLEY
Yes or no
Thoughts rush then stop Darren finally just nods
Crepsley raises his right hand The nails are not especially
long but they look thick and sharp
Crepsley takes Darrens hand jabs at his forefinger draws
blood He dabs off a drop smells it then tastes it

CREPSLEY
You have good blood
Crepsley lifts his own left hand He presses the nails of
his right into the fleshy tips of his left hand fingers
Then he uses the left nails to mark the right fingers in the
same way Blood drips down all ten fingers

CREPSLEY
Lift your hands
Darren does as hes told Crepsley digs all ten nails into
all ten of Darrens fingertips Darren jerks back in pain

CREPSLEY
Get used to pain More lies ahead
He motions to his hands Darren raises them fingers spread
Crepsley presses his fingertips to Darrens Blood brothers
As their eyes lock Darren frowns at an alien sensation

CREPSLEY
The blood flows into your left arm
and out of your right Do you feel
it Getting near your heart
Darren nods shivers

CREPSLEY
Almost there
A force arcs through Darrens body He screams falls down

Crepsley turns away starts to lick the blood from his
fingertips Tries to block out Darrens soft whimpering

resurrection to come
Darrens Dad tosses a handful of earth down onto the coffin

Cut TO

DARREN INSIDE THE CLOSED COFFIN

The lid an inch from his face His eyelid twitching as we
hear shovelfuls of dirt hit the lid The sound growing
duller at each turn Then as Darrens eye flickers open

Cut TO

EXT CEMETERY - NIGHT
Darren

Moonless The sound of digging continues Only now dirt is
coming out of the hole rather than going in

Crepsley is digging the coffin back up Effortlessly
Finally he spreads his feet apart pulls open the lid
Darren sputters as some of the dirt spills onto his face
Crepsley reaches down pulls him up and out of the grave
Darren sits on the ground coughing then moaning

CREPSLEY
On your feet

DARREN
My legs are asleep

Crepsley pulls him up anyhow Darren stumbles a few steps
nearly falls before finding his balance

CREPSLEY

Walk it off Ill fill this back

in Go Breathe some air

Crepsley closes the coffin begins to fill the hole as

ambles off Not exactly the start of his best day

MOVE WITH DARREN

Passing among the graves stretching his arms twisting
Really beat up He looks about the names and dates on the
headstones popping into focus even from far away Night
vision Suddenly he becomes aware of something

Steve On the other side of a mausoleum Ten feet away

DARREN
What are you doing here

STEVE
(smiles closing in)
Vampire hunting
Steve rushes the last step a jagged WOODEN STAKE held high
over his head He knocks Darren back on the ground
Pouncing on top he brings down the stake
Darren catches hold of Steves wrist Stops the point of the
stake just over his heart Steve puts his weight into it A
desperate moment of struggle but Darrens strength is
resurgent He throws Steve off

Steve rolls to his feet comes at him again Darren catches
his wrist with one hand his throat with the other He slams
him up against the mausoleum holds him there

DARREN
What do you have against vampires
You wanted to become one yourself

STEVE
Yeah I wanted to but you did
You stole my dream You stole my
destiny

DARREN
Are you crazy I did it to save
your life That was the deal Me
for you

STEVE

(UNHINGING)
Liar You told him I was evil
You planned this all along And
youll pay Youll pay --
Darren jams the stake under Steves throat That stops him
struggling The points jabs him as he swallows

DARREN
I want you to leave
Steve is just beginning to realize how strong Darren is now

DARREN
I want you to leave and forget you
ever saw me Understand
Scared he nods Darren shoves him away brakes the stake in
two Steve heads away looks back over his shoulder

STEVE
Im going to hunt you Darren You
and the other one Crepsley Ill
put a stake in you and burn you to

ashes Ill make sure you never

come back from the grave again

WHAM Steve walks right into Crepsley He picks Steve up by
the shoulders pulls him close With a voice like Death

CREPSLEY
If we ever meet again I will show
you loneliness you cannot imagine
Steve trembles in fear Crepsley lets go Steve takes off
running Crepsley looks to Darren

CREPSLEY
Do you still question his blood
Darrenthoughtful doesnt know what to think

DARREN
Would a stake through the heart
kill a vampire

CREPSLEY
Yes But so would getting hit by a
truck if it was going fast enough
Steve finally disappears from sight Crepsley sighs

CREPSLEY
Hell be trouble before its over

DARREN
Before whats over

CREPSLEY
This adventure were on Shall we
start
Darren hesitates looks to the twinkling lights of his city

CREPSLEY
Youll get used to it after awhile

Getting late stores closing The parking lot nearly empty

DARREN

Crepsley looks back to where Darren has stopped short

DARREN
1774

CREPSLEY
Should we do the math or not
Darren nods Crepsley motions him to keep up

CREPSLEY
I became a vampire when I was 20
years old In 1794

DARREN
1794

CREPSLEY
In Paris The days of the Terror
Heads in baskets Guillotines up

humans put their minds to it we
vampires can hardly compete

Darrens stare jogs him back from the good old days

M

ath 1794

CREPSLEY

So Ive been a

vampire now for 211 years Hmm
Darren nods again still with him

CREPSLEY

I age 1 year for every 10 so 211
divided by 10 Ive aged about 21
years in that time That 21 plus
my first human 20 makes me look
about 40

DARREN

But altogether youre 211 plus 20

CREPSLEY

DARREN
I couldnt see who was driving

As Darren considers this Crepsley stops suddenly

CREPSLEY
There
Ahead just more parking lot A WOMAN exiting a BOOKSTORE

DARREN

CREPSLEY
Dinner

CUT TO

EXT PARKING LOT - NIGHT

The woman nears her car A chirp as she unlocks it with her
remote She opens the back door sets the book bag on the
seat Suddenly she turns like someone called her name

WOMAN
Yes
Only nobodys there She shrugs it off closes the back
door But hesitates at the drivers side door Then she
starts walking away toward a back area of loading docks

Cut TO

DARREN and CREPSLEY
Watch from a dumpster by the loading dock She walks right
toward them One look at Crepsleys face and we know he must
be willing her over Darren looks terrified
But the air shimmers and Crepsley has disappeared
The woman steps up stops across from Darren As she frowns
tries to figure out who he is and how she got here

DARREN
Go Run

But Crepsley appears beside her He breathes into his
hand guides the air into her face He catches her as she
passes out Darren is horrified

DARREN
Did you kill her

CREPSLEY
I put her to sleep Shell be like
this 15 minutes When she wakes
up she wont remember a thing

Crepsley eases her to the ground finds a vein on her wrist

DARREN
Will she become a vampire

CREPSLEY
No Shed have to share y blood
for that to happen

DARREN
Dont take too much

CREPSLEY
A vampire who feeds often can
control himself One who drinks
only when he must can end up
feeding wildly
He uses one of his fingernails to open the vein

CREPSLEY
The hunger inside us must be fed to
be controlled To be civilized
Its what separates us from the
others

DARREN
What others
But as blood oozes he takes the womans wrist td his mouth
Darren is repulsed but cant look away Crepsley takes a
few deep swallows then holds the wrist out to Darren
CREPSLEY
Your turn

DARREN
No I wont

CREPSLEY
Darren

DARREN

Ill never do it
Crepsley runs his tongue over the cut rubs the saliva in

CREPSLEY
You can lead a vampire to blood
but you cant make him drink

DARREN
Im only half-vampire

CREPSLEY
No matter you need blood to live
now Youll drink eventually
When youre hungry enough
The wrist is clean the cut gone A barely perceptible scar

DARREN
Ill die first

CREPSLEY

(ANGER FLASHING)
Dont be stupid You may abstain
tonight but you must feed soon
Crepsley stands to go then stops short Tense he looks
about more hunted animal than man As he shrugs it off

DARREN
What is it
As the woman starts to stir
CREPSLEY
Nothing Lets go

DARREN
Something out there scares you
What is it

CREPSLEY
The thought of spending another
minute with you
Crepsley turns and walks but Darrens right

And the purple guy What was he

CREPSLEY
A vampaneze

DARREN
Yeah Keep talking

CREPSLEY
Long ago humans were looked upon as
animals by some vampires Cattle
to be slaughtered Laws were
passed to forbid needless killing
It made it easier to pass unnoticed
among humans if we didnt murder
them Most vampires obeyed

DARREN
But some didnt

CREPSLEY
Seventy vampires broke away
declared themselves a separate
race The Vampaneze Over time
their appearance changed their
numbers grew They believe its
wrong to feed from a human without
killing it

DARREN
What Thats crazy

CREPSLEY
They believe those of us who feed
in small amounts live like leeches
In shame It led to war
Crepsley touches the scar on his face remembers

CREPSLEY
The last one nearly destroyed us
all Theres been a truce for many
years now

could help him Mr Tall grabbed

DARREN
Im in between
CREPSLEY
In between does not exist
The words echo a moment Darren no closer to understanding

CREPSLEY
Ill sleep in here tonight But
sit outside the van tomorrow and
make it look like Im there Its
just caution Old habits die hard

VOICE
And old vampires
Without a sound someone has reached around the two of them
from behind a RAZOR-KNIFE held to each of their throats
They stand dead still We can make out the shape of a head
as whoever it is leans in ever so slightly from the dark

CREPSLEY
Gavner Purl as always I heard you
coming from a mile away
CLICK In his hand by his side Mr Crepsley holds a thin
SWITCHBLADE He presses the steel back ever so slightly

VOICE
Well call it a draw then
The voice pulls back his knives steps out Its GAVNER
PURL He was once handsome but those days are long gone
His face is crossed with scars They vary in size thickness
and color Gavner is a warrior carries himself so

GAVNER PURL
Its been too long Larten

CREPSLEY
Decades now
They embrace Darrens trying to catch up

DARREN
You guys are friends

GAVNER PURL
I suppose We once shared a coffin
together For six months
DARREN

(SARCASTIC)
Like roommates To save money

GAVNER PURL
We were being hunted

DARREN
Who was hunting you

CREPSLEY
Never mind Darren Gavner Purl
Gavner extends his hand to shake Darren seesthe scars on
Gavner Purls fingertips Darren raises his own hand so
Gavner can see his scars Gavner looks at Crepsley

GAVNER PURL
A half-vampire

CREPSLEY
Of course We dont make full
vampires of our assistants
Gavner Purl looks at Crepsley stunned

GAVNER PURL
Nor do we make assistants of
children

(MORE)

GAVNER PURL (contd)

(LOSING IT)
A child Larten Why

CREPSLEY
I have my reasons

GAVNER PURL
And they are
CREPSLEY
I dont owe answers to vampires
anymore Im exiled from our kind

GAVNER PURL
Self-exiled And I at least am
owed an answer

Theres a personal history being called upon here

is well aware Darren again is left out

CREPSLEY
All I care to say is a boy sought
me out knew who I was He asked
me to make him my assistant
Gavner looks to Darren suspicious

GAVNER PURL
And how did you know --

CREPSLEY

(INTERRUPTS)
t wasnt Darren Another boy
His blood was bad I should have
illed him but I didnt
Darren reacts Gavner considers it all

CREPSLEY

I met Darren shortly after His
blood was good or I certainly would
have killed him

Darren reacts again

GAVNER PURL
How could a boy find you
Crepsley shrugs Of course he had help

GAVNER PURL
Tiny

DARREN

Crepsley
He tried to kill us

CREPSLEY
He tried to kill me What he
wanted with you wasnt determined

GAVNER PURL
Perhaps you chose the wrong boy
In Mr Tinys eyes
A moment as they consider the unspoken implications

DARREN
What are you guys talking about
No answer as Crepsley and Gavner lock each other in a look

CREPSLEY
Whats important enough to track
down an exile What is your news

GAVNER PURL
War

CREPSLEY
Im not interested in your wars

GAVNER PURL
Well the other side is interested
or they wouldnt be trying to get
rid of you
Crepsley gets suddenly very angry

CREPSLEY
Ive had enough killing No more
Youve come to the wrong place I
am the wrong place
Gavner raises his hands in surrender

GAVNER PURL
Even so Im glad youre alive

CREPSLEY

(RELENTING)
The sun is coming Will you stay

GAVNER PURL
I can still make miles The war
wont wait And neither will bad
news I have to go

CREPSLEY
Then travel safely

GAVNER PURL
Would you mind if I walk a bit with
your assistant

CREPSLEY
Take him with you if you want
Hes of little use to me

CUT TO
EXT FIELD - NOT FAR OFF - NIGHT
Darren and Gavner Purl walk Gavner looks him over

GAVNER PURL
You look sick Doesnt Larten feed
you

DARREN
I wont drink blood if thats what
you mean I promised myself

GAVNER PURL
Why

DARREN
Youll get insulted
As Gavner waits for Darren to tell him

DARREN
Im afraid if I drink blood Ill
become evil
Gavner LAUGHS out loud catches himself

GAVNER PURL
The only thing drinking blood will
do to you is keep you alive

DARREN
Thats how it would start I would
swear it was just to stay alive
But whatll I turn into Youre on

one side of the fence or the other

My father used to say that and now

I know what he meant

The father part chokes Darren up a bit

GAVNER PURL
Youve already turned Darren You
need to accept what youve already
become Theres no going back
They walk in silence a moment Then

DARREN
Why did Crepsley make himself an
exile anyhow

GAVNER PURL
He was tired of all the killing
We were at war

DARREN
With the vampaneze

GAVNER PURL
Crepsley was once a Vampire
General One of our great leaders
He may seem reluctant but I assure
you no one is as skilled at
killing vampaneze than Crepsley is
I think thats why theyd like to
get him out of the way Kill him
off before the new war starts

DARREN
Youve known him a long time

GAVNER PURL
I was his assistant He blooded
me as he blooded you
Theres almost something comforting in this news Gavner
Purl so proud and strong looking Darren wants to know
DARREN
Whyd he choose you

GAVNER PURL
To teach me to kill vampaneze Up
until now its the only reason he
ever chooses anyone

DARREN
Is it why he chose me
Gavner hesitates not sure

GAVNER PURL
Thats for Crepsley to say Not
me
Another brick wall but Darren accepts it

GAVNER PURL
Do you know what the biggest danger
is to a vampire Darren

DARREN
The vampaneze Mr Tiny

GAVNER PURL
No Its that they live so long
they no longer care Everything
they love is left behind until they
finally have nothing left to live
for Except death The fact that
hes taken an apprentice seems to
me a good sign A sign that hes
thinking of living not dying

DARREN
Lucky for me Glad I could help
All the same Darren considers what hes heard Gavner
meanwhile considers the open countryside ahead

GAVNER PURL
A clear run Good
Gavner gives Darren one last appraising look
GAVNER PURL
Stay by him Darren Stay by him
Gavner takes a deep breath The air around him shimmers his
image bouncing in and out of phase like an electron heating
up And then hes gone

DARREN
That part is definitely cool

CUT TO
EXT THE SUN - DAY
High in the noon sky PAN DOWN to where Darren stands under

a tree by the old van He concentrates looks himself over
Nothing He concentrates again Hes trying to flit

Very briefly -- the air shimmers around him -- then stops
He looks at his arms Little WISPS of smoke come off them

EVRA

(ARRIVING)
Whats up

DARREN
Nothing

EVRA

(SNIFFS AIR)
Its smells like burnt hair

DARREN
Dont know Im congested

(SEES SOMETHING)

Hey
Evra follows his gaze turns just in time to see

THEIR POV
Debbie and Sam ducking inside the factory
window

DARREN and EVRA
Exchange a look Start after them

CUT TO
INT FACTORY FLOOR - DAY

Where the show was the night before Light streams down from
gaps in the decrepit roof No sight of Debbie and Sam as
Darren and Evra make their way in- They pause at a CREAKING
coming from somewhere overhead As they move

CUT TO
INT UPPER FLOOR - FACTORY - DAY

Darren and Evra come off a rickety staircase pass through a
half-rotted door There are holes in the roof overhead and
huge gaps on the floor where the boards have fallen through
They see Sam his back to them staring out a smashed

EVRA
Lets scare the crap out of him
They begin to creep in flanking the unsuspecting Sam But
as they get close a SHAPE drops down behind them

SHAPE

ARRRGGGH
Darren and Evra are the ones who jump The shape is Debbie
She almost falls over laughing So does Sam

DEBBIE
You should see the look on your
faces
But Evra and Darren are not laughing

EVRA
Whatre you doing here
DEBBIE
We could ask you the same thing
We come here all the time My
grandfather used to work here

DARREN
Mustve been a long time ago

DEBBIE
He says now its like one of those
bombed out World War II cathedrals
Empty of what is used to be
An odd little moment till Sam breaks it

SAM
Hey we loved the show man It
was off the hook

EVRA
(messing with him)
Off the hook huh Ill tell all
the freaks you said so

SAM
Are you guys on your own Just
traveling No parents or nothing

DARREN
No No parents
He says it with a little twinge that Debbie picks up on

SAM
School

EVRA
No school either

SAM
Youre the luckiest guys on earth
Wanna switch places

DARREN
You have to be different to be
here

DEBBIE
Different how
Evra steps into a slash of sunlight and his skin flashes to
life the green of his scales catching the rays Debbies
mouth drops They couldnt see it in the dark last night

EVRA
Everyone has a place they belong
The Cirque du Freak is ours

DEBBIE
I think your skin is beautiful
That wins Evra over

DEBBIE

Can I touch it
Evra holds out his arm Debbie traces a finger across it

DEBBIE
Wow Has it always been this way

DARREN
Hes a snake-boy

DEBBIE
You shouldnt call him names
because he looks different

EVRA
Its okay I am a snake boy

SAM
You could say youre
dermatologically challenged
They all LAUGH Debbie considers Evra a beat then Darren

DEBBIE
What about you Darren How are
you different

DARREN
I get scared easy
Darren looks up toward the rafters From where she dropped

DARREN
Howd you get up there anyhow

DEBBIE
You mean how did a girl get up
there

CUT TO

EXT FACTORY ROOF - DAY

A spot where the roofing is gone several long RAFTERS
stretch out Darren Evra and Sam watch Debbie walk out on
one Like a balance beam The factory floor 70 feet below

EVRA
Hey be careful

SAM
Dont worry Shes like a gymnast
Debbie moves slowly at first her arms stretched out for
balance Then she does a hop a skip Darren and Evra gasp
She gets to the other side turns and bows

DARREN
Youre crazy

DEBBIE
How about you

DARREN

I got nothing to prove

DEBBIE
But itd be easier for you than me

DARREN
Whys that

DEBBIE
Because chickens have wings
She starts chicken CLUCKING Mad Darren steps onto a
rafter starts across He stops in the middle spins around
Aided immeasurably by his half-vampire skills

Debbie is impressed

ANGLE OVERHEAD
The vertigo angle as Debbie walks back out on her rafter
Stops about 4-feet across from Darren

DARREN and DEBBIE
Darren crosses his arms across his chest No big deal

DEBBIE
Lets play mirrors

DARREN
Whats that

DEBBIE
I do something and you have to copy
me Like this
Debbie crosses her arms the same way Darren has He
uncrosses them as he realizes
Debbie reaches down touches her toes Darren sighs then
does the same gets a good look at the floor below
Debbie takes one foot off the rafter takes hold of the top
of it with one hand raising the other arm out for balance
Looks like a ballerina
Evra doesnt like this daredevil stuff

EVRA
Come on guys
Darren hesitates Not because he wont do it but because
maybe for the first time in his life hes really fascinated
by a girl Debbie misreads starts CLUCKING again
Darren smiles repeats her move effortlessly
Without warning Debbie leaps the gap lands on the rafter
alongside Darren As she struggles a bit for balance Darren
reaches out and steadies her As they come face to face

DEBBIE
There definitely something
different about you I just cant
figure it out

DARREN
Is Sam your boyfriend
spinning

DEBBIE
Hes my cousin

DARREN
Oh
A funny awkward beat out on the rafter Finally

DARREN
We should get off this
She nods a bit smitten Darren turns As they start off

DARREN
Chalk it up to lack of blood but everything starts

DARRENS POV
The area is like a big drain and hes whirling down it

RAFTER
Darren legs go out and he falls off As Debbie screams
Darren CATCHES HOLD of the rafter just as he drops past it

DEBBIE
Hold on
Debbie grabs his arm Evra starts out to help but the
rafter CREAKS OMINOUSLY He stops Sam states the obvious

SAM
I dont think itll hold you dude

EVRA
Thanks for the heads up Bro

DARREN
(shakes it off)
Its okay Im okay
Darren swings up a leg hooks it over the rafter A beat and
hes back on top Debbie relieved Evra backs up the way he
came and in a few seconds theyre all safely off the rafter

DEBBIE
I dont know how you hung on I
couldnt have

DARREN
You wouldnt have fallen in the
first place I just got dizzy

DEBBIE

Maybe you need to eat something
Darren looks at her She has no idea

EVRA
Well the foods down on ground
level Lets get out of here
Sam and Debbie start off Darren and Evra following As Sam
and Debbie start down a ladder Darren hangs back a beat

DARREN
Shes kindof cool huh I mean
for a girl

EVRA
I like her She asks a lot of
questions though

DARREN
Shes just curious

EVRA
Theres no such thing as just
with a girl

DARREN

EVRA

Crepsley grabs hold of Darren hauls him into

CREPSLEY
No need to hunt Theres someone
here willing to save you
From the shadows Madam Truska Startlingly beautiful She
steps up Eyes on Darren she offers Crepsley her wrist

MADAM TRUSKA

As Crepsleys fingernail hovers ready to open a vein
Darren shakes his head No

CREPSLEY

Crepsley releases Truskas arm

CREPSLEY

CUT TO
INT FACTORY SPACE - NIGHT

People in their seats or taking them Darren is back in his
role as usher He seats two people wipes at the sweat
beading on his forehead Hes getting sicker

He sees Debbie She and Sam are already seated across the
way She smiles waves Darren forces a smile waves back
Looking for more patrons Darren nearly walks into A
FIGURE A hat pulled down obscures his face

VOICE
An usher in the house of usher
And I cant seem to find a seat
Darren frowns at the odd voice but leads down the aisle

DARREN
This way
Darren brings him down to a handful of seats The figure
looks up from under the brim of his hat Its Mr Tiny

MR TINY
Join me

DARREN

I dont think so
As Darren moves to go Mr Tiny clamps a hand around his
wrist Like iron He sits pulling Darren down beside him

MR TINY

Its time we had a few moments
Folks involved in epic struggles
should get to know each other
Darren doesnt answer

MR TINY
Has Crepsley told you about me
Explained me

DARREN
He said you cant be explained
You need to be experienced

MR TINY
He gives me too much credit

DEBBIE
Hey Darren
Darren looks up to see Debbie and Sam Oh no

DEBBIE
Were gonna sit on this side

SAM
Cuz we miss you so much
She digs Sam with her elbow They sit just a row in front

MR TINY

(WHISPERS)
Choosing sides can only lead to
trouble Never ever choose sides
unless its your own

DARREN
Youve chosen the vampaneze
Mr Tiny laughs slaps his knee even

MR TINY

Is that really what you think A

smart boy like you

And the lights drop A trumpet blasts and all is silent

ON THE STAGE

The little people wheel out a CAGE Theres a gurgled GROWL
The little people retreat Several audience members lean in
then SCREAM as the wolfman CRASHES to the front of the cage

A white spot shines down on Mr Tall

MR TALL
Ladies and Gentlemen

DARREN and MR TINY

MR TINY
-Ssubjugators and saps

MR TALL

Welcome to the Cirque du Freak We
are an ancient circus

As Mr Tall drones on

MR TINY

Oh his speeches are impossible

Mr Tiny opens his free hand His pocket watch melts up into
view from his palm Time begins to speed up around them

Mr Talls voice speeds to a BUZZ as he keystone cops off
the stage and Rhamus keystones on The audiences small
movements become rattles and shakes

Only Darren and Mr Tiny are at normal speed

MR TINY

Im not so complicated Darren
During war there are those who
profit A war between vampires and
vampaneze would have terrible
consequences Therefore

DARREN
Terrible profits

MR TINY

Excellent I am a profiteer I

exact fees and gains Im simple

On stage Madam Truska exits and Evra keystones through

performance with his snake

MR TINY
Did Crepsley tell you of the
prophesy

DARREN
What prophesy

other

MR TINY

They say the final battle between
vampires and vampaneze will be

decided by a child Thats why the
vampires wont blood children To

avoid the end of the world

As these words are pondered by Darren

MR TINY
I think I underestimated you I
think you could be wonderful

DARREN
I think youre a creep I think
you suck
MR TINY
Too bad

Mr Tiny closes his hand around the watch Time returns to
normal The applause for Evra slowing down to normal speed
As he walks off the stage Debbie looks back at Darren

DEBBIE
He was great
As she looks back to the stage someone sits on Darrens

side Collar pulled up head wrapped in a scarf Murlough

MURLOUGH
(low re Debbie)
Is it Dar-wrens girlfriend

DARREN
Forget about her --
Murlough takes hold of Darrens other wrist Still low

MURLOUGH
She has plenty of lovely blood
inside Inside outside hmmm
Darren struggles Murlough pulls him close HISSES in his
ear flashing those filthy teeth

MURLOUGH
I dont care about humans I dont
care about you But the vampire -
Larten Crepsley - him I care about

(ALMOST SHY)
Murlough is a vampire killer

On stage the spotlight hits Crepsley

DARREN
You guys are in trouble Theres

Murlough reacts to the name Does not like it

MURLOUGH

Madam Octas cage drops to the stage as Murlough knocks
Crepsley fifteen feet through the air He lands flat on his
back The audience CHEER Think its part of the show
Murlough reaches into his jacket produces a razor-sharp

LONG
KNIFE in either hand
Crepsley pops to his feet As his own single BLADE
switches to life in his hand

DARREN and MR TINY
As Darren struggles Mr Tiny switches his grip to the back
of the boys neck That holds him

STAGE
CHEERS as Murlough charges forward the long knives
pinwheeling in his hands His attack is brutal and blunt
Crepsley is driven back parrying each thrust and attack as
it comes Sparks fly as the blades connect
From out of nowhere Crepsley adds a BACKHAND to the mix It
catches Murlough hard across the chops

OFF STAGE
Mr Tall and Evra watch Not knowing what to do

STAGE
Murlough swings back wildly Crepsley catches the blade in
Murloughs left hand with the one in his right
Crepsley catches Murloughs left wrist the second blade
dangerously close to retracing the scar on Crepsleys face
Crepsley throws himself back sending Murlough head over
heels across the stage and SLAMMING into a concrete wall

DARREN
Concentrating Trying to flit

STAGE
Murlough rolls to his feet charges Its brute force versus
style But as Crepsley moves to sidestep Murloughs not so
brutish after all He matches the move --
Buries one of his knives into Crepsleys stomach Crepsley
reacts frozen in shock

DARREN and MR TINY

The audience around them unsure Many shocked Its part of
the show right Darren sees Murlough raise the other knife
to finish Crepsley off Darren trembling phasing

And Mr Tinys holding nothing but air Darren is gone

Speeding down to the stage The dagger descends in slo-
motion but its only a centimeter or two from its target

target As Murlough staggers right Crepsley staggers left
Murlough regroups charges after him Badly hurt stumbling

On the catwalks Murlough draws his knives Crepsley jumps
to the space he wants to defend draws his own Murlough
counters Two very serious predators-at work The animal
kingdom at its killing best
A charge Murlough a bull Crepsley a matador He redirects
one of Murloughs arcing arms smashing it against a metal
housing One of the vampanezes knives clatters away
Its not graphic or bloody but several times Crepsleys
knife finds its way into Murloughs body It enrages him
but Crepsley continues dealing out punishment
Hes now like a brilliant counter-puncher even as he
inadvertently backs his way into a corner
But as quarters close in Murloughs rage works to his
advantage He charges into Crepsley his lowered shoulder
sending Crepsley through the air and into
And through a BRICK WALL Into the thin air outside Still
raging Murlough nearly falls through himself Instead he
slips drops about twenty feet down inside the building

STEVE
Hes more surprised than shocked Until the wolfman looks
his way Then he heads for the hills disappears into the
dark The wolfman turns back toward Debbie
She backs away takes off up a rickety stairway The wolfman
HOWLS then follows
Darrens too weak to follow near tears in frustration and
regret He watches after them then he looks over at Sam
Sam who is dying Just a few feet away His eyes flicker to
Darrens He tries to say something but cant
DARREN
Oh Sam Oh no
Darren crawls over takes Sams bloody hand

SAM
Go save Debbie Darren
Sam manages the smallest smile As his eyes drift shut

SAM
I think she loves you
From above we hear Debbie SCREAM Darren considers Sams
blood knows what he has to do Leave his humanity behind
and cross the line He needs to drink Sams blood

DARREN
Forgive me Sam but I need
strength I need blood
As Darren extends his nails over Sams wrist

DARREN
Were going to save her together

CUT TO
INT UPPER FLOOR - FACTORY - NIGHT

Debbie backing into a corner The wolfman almost on her

Murlough arrives Pure animal action as he tears into
wolfie sends him retreating licking his wounds into the
darkness Murlough heaves for breath pretty beat up
himself And here comes Steve Cautiously

STEVE
Is Crepsley dead

MURLOUGH
Who knows Young Murlough lives
but hes hurt

STEVE
What can I do
time

MURLOUGH
What can Dar-wrens girlfriend do
We need to get the blood inside
outside Dont we
Then we hear it a blood-curdling scream filters up Its

DARREN - BACKSTAGE AREA

Hes drunk Sams blood He rises His sickness wicking off
him Strength descending Empowered Furious He screams
again the sound taking shape into words

DARREN
FORGIVE ME

FACTORY STAGE SPACE
The audience who havent left react as the chilling sound
reaches them

BACKSTAGE AREA - FACTORY
Fully 12 vampire powered he takes the stairs two at a

UPPER FLOOR
Murlough looming over Debbie smiles as Darren arrives

DARREN
Let her go

STEVE
Stop being a big shot This isnt
like stopping some fight at school

DARREN
Shut up Steve

Murloughs eyes go very very dark He attacks

Darren tries to meet the onslaught but hes bowled over
Knocked in a heap

Debbie moves to go after Murlough from behind Shes going
to go down fighting as well But Steve intercepts her Hes
pretty powerful himself

Murlough pulls Darren to his feet stands him up He swings
his fist in a vicious arc

Darren just ducks it and Murloughs fist SMASHES right
through the wall (an inside wall) alongside Darrens head
Murloughs getting tired of Darren

MURLOUGH
You need to stand still so you can
die
But as he attempts to pull his arm back through he cant
He frowns Then his eyes widen in pain
Murlough jerks his arm back as hard as he can The wall
smashes open as Murlough brings his arm back through with
Crepsley hanging onto the end of it

FACTORY SPACE
The audience who remain chanting Refund Refund They
react as debris falls from above smashes to the stage

UPPER FLOOR - FACTORY

Crepsley brings up his knife

Murlough catches him by the wrist with one hand

With the other he grips Crepsley by the throat SLAMS him
hard into an I-beam pillar Again Then he squeezes We
can hear the cartilage crunching in Crepsleys throat
But Crepsley covers his own right hand with his left He
drives the knife blade INTO MURLOUGHS HEART

Murlough looks down at the handle of the knife then back at
Crepsley whose throat he still holds

Murlough gives him a lopsided grin and then pitches back
falling through one of the holes in the floor Taking
Crepsley with him

FACTORY SPACE
SCREAMS from the audience as Murlough descends Somewhere in
mid-fall Crepsley FLITS disappears When Murlough hits the
center of the stage he hits it alone Dead
As people start for the exits we see Mr Tinyis among
them

UPPER FLOOR
But as Darren stands its not over Steve grabs Debbie
pushes her to the edge where the rafters are
STEVE
Stay back Or Ill throw her off
I mean it
It sounds like he does Darren looks intently at Debbie
She looks back Then Darren makes CHICKEN CLUCK SOUNDS
Understanding Debbie tears herself away To the precipice
But instead of falling she continues out on a rafter
Steve slides out after her But as he reaches for her she
deftly skips across the rafters jumps back to the floor
Before Steve can follow Darren cuts him off Below them
rows of jagged rusty pipes The remains of a pumping
station Shredded now broken Waiting to impale

DARREN
Its over Steve

STEVE
Is it
Steve lunges They come together trading shots stumbling
but still having to make the rafters A missed footfall will
be their last They separate try to gain position

STEVE
You wanna hear something funny
After your funeral I went to see
your parents
They continue circling

STEVE
And they were fine They acted
like they barely remembered you

DARREN
Liar

Darren lunges but Steves ready He CUFFS Darren in the
head Darren falls ends up hanging Steve looms smiling

STEVE

(SMILES)
And your sister She was moving
into your room They had a yard
sale I bought some of your stuff
hangs

Steves foot on his hand Darren about to die Oddly

DARREN
Did you steal money from my moms
purse
STEVE
What
DARREN
Did you

Darren hanging there dead grim Steves curious

STEVE
Why do you ask Is knowing that
gonna help you rest in peace

DARREN
No Its just practically the last
thing that ever happened between me
and my dad was I was arguing with
him

STEVE

(FLIP)
Least you had a dad to argue with
A fury building in Darren

DARREN
I was telling him he was wrong
about you Thats the last time we
had together Fighting about you

STEVE
Hate to tell ya Your dad was
right How do you think we got the
money for the dumb tickets I took
it Just like Im gonna take you
Steve jams his foot down into Darrens face but Darren

on In fact with a superhuman surge he hauls himself up
no matter how many times Steve hits him
do

WHAM Darren lets Steve have it

DARREN
I miss him

WHAM

DARREN
Do you understand

WHAM

DARREN
I miss him so much
WHAM Steves arm pinwheel for balance Hes going over
But just as he pitches off the end rafter
Darren catches him by his belt Nearly bent backward he
hangs back over the abyss If Darren lets go Steve will
fall into the spikes below
Crespley steps up beside Debbie knows what Darren should

CREPSLEY
Kill him Darren Do it now so you
wont have to do it later
Darren looks at Steve A moment theyll remember forever

DARREN

(SOFTLY SADLY)
No He used to be my friend
Darren flings Steve back the other way To safety

DARREN
Start running Dont ever stop

Steve hesitates It wasnt supposed to be like this Darren

starts off the rafter toward him One last look of hate

STEVE
Next time
And hes gone Disappearing into the dark
Darren joins Debbie Nothing left to hide

DEBBIE
Sam
Darren shakes his head Sam didnt make it

She understands Darren looks at Crepsley Hes a mess

DARREN
Are you gonna be okay

CREPSLEY
I just need to catch my breath
For a few days Maybe a week

DARREN
You think I made a mistake dont
you

CREPSLEY

No I think that you proved
yourself human after all
Human As Darren absorbs this kindness smiles

DARREN
Half human What now

CREPSLEY
What do you mean

DARREN
Theres a war on isnt there
Crepsley shrugs

DARREN
This world is crossed by fences
You have to decide which side you
stand on

CREPSLEY
Yes yes Black and white fences
crossing very gray fields

DARREN
Its not gray Ive met the bad
guys They need to be stopped

CREPSLEY
Im not sure its my fight

DARREN
But you said it Theres no in
between And the power of being
alone is never going to be greater
than the weakness Its our fight

Cut TO

EXT FACTORY - NIGHT

As PATRONS try to get as far as they can as quick as they
can We see Steve duck out blending in
Mr Tinys Lincoln Continental pulls up As Steve gets in

CUT TO
EXT FIELD - NEAR THE CAMPSITE - NIGHT

Mr Tall Evra Debbie Darren and Crepsley Crepsley sets
Sams body down in the grass Its covered with one of Madam
Truskas tent silks As Crepsleys eyes meet Darrens

DARREN

(A WHISPER)
He was a good kid Its weird but
I remember things about him even
though I wasnt there when they
happened Even though its
impossible
A moment as Crepsley nods sadly at this most singular boy

CREPSLEY
His blood is in you

MR TALL
Ill deal with the police when they
come What Ill say I dont know

DEBBIE
Say what happened Some crazy guy
showed up Sam was in the wrong
place at the wrong time
Theyre all quiet a moment
EVRA
He was brave

DEBBIE

(SADLY)
For the only time in his life

DARREN
He didnt die in vain
A beat

MR TALL

Time to fly or flit or whatever you
call it The sun wont wait all

night

CREPSLEY
Actually thats exactly what it
does

Mr Tall manages a smile considers the sky a moment

MR TALL
Time will tell what this night has
brought us

CREPSLEY
Yes Keep my coffin ready would
you

MR TALL
Always
As they exchange farewells Debbie turns to Darren

DEBBIE
Do you think well meet again

DARREN
You never know
As she hugs him tight she whispers in his ear

DEBBIE
I hope so
DARREN

(WHISPERS BACK)
Hope is a good word I hope so
too
And so goodbye Darren and Crepsley start down the road

DARREN
Where are we going

CREPSLEY
To meet the Vampire Generals War
clouds are forming A storm is
coming And I have a feeling
youre needed much more than I am

DARREN
So what are we waiting for Lets
go

Crepsley offers his hand

CREPSLEY
Take my arm
Darren shakes his head doesnt need it
He shimmers flits into the night
Crepsley laughs to himself As he follows

FADE TO BLACK
