1A CLOSEUP - MANS FACE 1A
Handsome Capable-looking Sharp chiseled features But its
the eyes that grab you Theyre the coldest crudest eyes
youve ever seen and they belong to CHARLES RANE known in the
terrorism trade as Wolfgang On the Interpol Hit Parade
Wolfgang is number one with a bullet
DR BAUMAN (0S)
Close please
Wolfgang closes his eyes A felt-tip pen ENTERS FRAME and
begins to make precise marks on Wolfgangs features These are
the marks of a skilled plastic surgeon mapping out the
operation he intends to perform Everything about Wolfgangs
face will change
DR BAUMAN (0S)
Open
Wolfgang opens his eyes No amount of surgery can change them
They remain cold cruel and penetrating
DR BAUMAN (0S)
Well
A mirror ENTERS FRAME Wolfgang smiles at his marked-up image
eyes gleaming with wicked pleasure This is one scary guy

2 INT SURGERY 2
Darkness Then -- BOOM --a big overhead light comes on
illuminating Wolfgang who reclines in a custom operating chair
surrounded by gleaming high-tech equipment and a surgical team
headed by DR MICHAEL BAUMAN the Florida Gulf coasts
foremost plastic surgeon
Dr Bauman looks at the wall clock Two minutes til noon
Bauman wipes some sweat from his lip and adjusts his surgical
mask
BAUMAN
Sedate the patient
An enter TANK HISSES to life
3 EXT CLINIC GROUNDS - DAY 3
Baumans beautiful hacienda-style hospital is located high in
the Palisades overlooking the ocean Without noise or fanfare
three SWAT vans arrive ON the SCENE
4 SURGERY 4
A nurse prepares to place the ether mask over Wolfgangs nose
and mouth But the patient has other ideas Wolfgang reaches
up and catches the nurse by the wrist
WOLFGANG
(politely)
That wont be necessary I intend to
stay awake
The surgical team reacts with shocked surprise
5 INT CORRIDOR 5

SWAT commandos are on their way moving with swift military
precision -- each commando armed with the latest in high-tech
weaponry

6 SURGERY 6

Bauman is flustered by Wolfgangs refusal to be sedated

BAUMAN
You dont understand The work I have
to do -- the pain involved --

Pain is Wolfgangs favorite word He smiles his Deaths Head
smile
WOLFGANG

Pain is something Ive learned to

live with
Its all there in Wolfgangs eyes Not just pain but the
pleasure of pain Wolfgang cant wait for Bauman to cut into
him Bauman realizes hes dealing with one weird motherfucker
and wisely decides to humor him

BAUMAN

All right Lets proceed
A scrub nurse presents an operating tray to Bauman On it are
an assortment of strange scalpels and instruments Bauman
shoots a nervous look at the clock -- thirty seconds til noon
-- and selects a wicked-looking scalpel
7 CORRIDOR 7
SWAT commandos converge on the door marked Surgery
8 SURGERY 8
Bauman bends over Wolfgang He brings up the scalpel his hand
shaking ever so slightly A drop of sweat falls from Baumans
forehead and lands on Wolfgangs lower lip Wolfgangs tongue
darts out and licks it away
Bauman and Wolfgang lock eyes Wolfgang knows that Bauman has
set him up

WOLFGANG

The patient lived But Im afraid we

lost the doctor
Wolfgangs hand darts up like a cobra grabs the scalpel and
thrusts it into Baumans neck Bauman screams and staggers
back spraying blood The surgical team recoils in horror
At that moment the door is kicked open by SWAT

SWAT COMMANDER

Freeze
Wolfgang is already on his feet He takes two long strides
dives through the air and CRASHES through a wall of smoked
GLASS
8A ADJOINING ROOM 8A
Wolfgang hits the floor in a shower of glass scrambles to his
feet and bursts through a door knocking over a nurse
8B INT CORRIDOR 8B
Terrified patients and staff flatten themselves against the
walls as Wolfgang comes charging down the corridor half-
naked surgical gown flapping behind him pursued by a wave of
SWAT commandos
9 THRU 11 OMITTED
12 ANGLE 12

Wolfgang rounds the bend At the end of the corridor is an
elevator -- its doors have begun to separate Its Wolfgangs
only chance
Wolfgang races for the elevator bare feet slapping marble
Hes halfway there when the elevator doors slide open to
reveal a second team of SWAT cops They spill out with weapons
drawn ready to open fire
Wolfgang puts on the brakes The first SWAT team arrives from
behind and Wolfgang is caught in the middle One false move
and he gets fragged from both directions Oh well With a
shrug of indifference Wolfgang raises his hands over his
head

SWAT OFFICER

Youre under arrest
The smile on Wolfgangs face seems to say Temporarily
Wolfgang begins to whistle Pack Up Your Troubles as SWAT
cops rush forward to cuff him

13 EXT NIGHT SKY 13
Fierce RAIN Dense clouds First the awsome ROAR then we see
the massive underbelly of a 707 airliner as it lumbers ACROSS
FRAME Clouds thicken The big ENGINES work hard against the
storm Suddenly an EXPLOSION rips out the bulk cargo door and
the airliner hurtles to earth -- on fire and out of control --
a symphony of WIND and noise

13A INT BEDROOM (LOS ANGELES) - NIGHT 13A
JOHN CUTTER sits upright in bed jolted from the nightmare
His eyes are wide with fear

CUTTER

Lisa

Cutters naked chest is soaked with sweat and his heart is
pounding like a jackhammer The annoying sound in his ears is
the BUZZ OF his ALARM CLOCK
Cutter SHUTS OFF the ALARM 6 AM
Cutter looks around Nothing to worry about Hes alone in his
own bedroom bathed in the blue glow of a TV test pattern
Cutter runs a hand through his damp hair Hes a black man in

his late 20s -- handsome and muscular --but unable to shake
the nightmare that has haunted him for two years
CUTTER

(under his breath)
I gotta get some new dreams

ANGLE WIDENS
The room is pretty much bare Bed nightstand and a Solo-flex
exercise set-up Cutter is a man of few possessions The walls
are covered with a variety of bulls-eyes and target
silhouettes -- the kind used by law enforcement Each one is
expensively framed -- Cutters idea of art
The ALARM GOES OFF AGAIN

CUTTER

I heard you the first time

Cutter SHUTS OFF the ALARM and climbs out of bed He goes to
the Solo-flex and begins a rigorous workout --pumping iron to
keep the chaos inside him at bay As Cutter battles the
weights we PUSH IN ON the nightstand

brochure and a ticket -- round trip -- Los Angeles to Orlando

CRASHES
Bars slide open with a LOUD CLANG CAMERA FOLLOWS a
distinguished silver-haired ATTORNEY as he enters the bowels
of a prison designed in hell He travels down a long corridor
lined with cells containing the evil and the insane They
jeer laugh taunt and spit at the Attorney as he runs their
gauntlet of abuse
At the end of the corridor a stem-faced guard stands in front
of an iron door The Attorney wiping spit off his expensive
suit with a handkerchief shows the indifferent guard some
papers The guard wheels open the heavy iron door
CAMERA FOLLOWS the Attorney into a small dark room The iron
DOOR CLANGS shut behind him On the other side of a mesh
screen sits Wolfgang stripped naked wearing handcuffs His
body is hard and muscular a map of ugly scars He greets his
Attorney with a wolfish smile

WOLFGANG
whats wrong Martin Havent you
ever seen a naked man before

ATTORNEY
How can you be so calm They know who
you are

WOLFGANG

Knowing it and proving it are two
different things
ATTORNEY
Will you listen to me They can prove
it Theyve got the Welshman
Wolfgangs eyes cloud They do that when something displeases
him
WOLFGANG
Go on
ATTORNEY
The NSA has him in protective
custody Hes connected you to
Islamic Jihad the American Embassy
bombing in Beirut and God knows what

Angeles to stand trial

Cutter steps into the outer office He tosses his bag on the
couch
SECRETARY
You must be Mister Cutter Mister
Delvecchios expecting you
CUTTER
Dont buzz him I want this to be a
surprise
Cutter crosses the room and pushes open the big door to
18B SLYS INNER OFFICE 18B
Cutter is barely through the door when SLY DELVECCHIO jumps
him from behind
In a blinding flash of martial arts skill Cutter flips Sly
over his shoulder Sly hits the carpet with a thud Swift as a
cobra Cutter is upon him -- knee planted in the center of
Slys chest hand tight around Slys throat -- thumb pressed
to his jugular
CUTTER
(with a smile)
Youre dead Sly Get yourself

buried
Through his surprise and pain Sly smiles back Hes in his
early 30s a friendly likable guy -- Cutters buddy from way

back
SLY
(his voice is a rough whisper)
Okay Im dead Now would you mind
getting your big knee off my chest
(gasping)
I cant breathe
Cutter just smiles as Sly continues to gasp Sly is very
convincing but Cutters not buying He knows his friend too
well

SLY
Cutter please I cant
breathe

CUTTER

Sly do the words ‘acting lessons

SLY
(really gasping)
Cutter no shit you know Ive got

Cutter frowns and steps back As he does sneaky Sly tries to
hook him with his foot But Cutter has anticipated this He
catches the foot with one hand and hoists Sly into the air so

that hes hanging upside down -- face buried in the rug
CUTTER
(amused)
Hows that carpet taste
SLY

All right Okay Uncle
Slys Secretary appears in the doorway alarmed to see her
boss in this most undignified position
SECRETARY
(frightened)

Navy buddies catching up on old

SLY
(to Cutter)
You want something Coffee Tea
CUTTER

(to the Secretary)

But youd better bring Mister

Delvecchio some Therapeutic Mineral

The Secretary nods and backs away Cutter releases Sly and
lets him crumple to the floor With a groan Sly gets to his
feet He straightens his suit and tie in a dignified manner

SLY
Okay So Ima little rusty But

Sly and Cutter regard each other soberly then break out
laughing They embrace

The Secretary returns
SECRETARY

SLY

Ramsay is Stuart Ramsay the guy

above me -- President of Operations

To get the airlines anti-terrorism

unit off the ground were gonna need

Ramsays support Hes a slick prick

but he can be handled Youve done

these dog and pony shows before so

you know the drill Nod Smile Jump

through a few hoops
STUART RAMSAY rises from a table to greet them Hes in his
thirties handsome immaculately groomed and styled Stuart
Ramsays only real interest in life is his own survival in the
corporate jungle In this respect he is ruthless He can also
be quite charming

RAMSAY
Welcome to the jungle

John -- Ima big fan
Cutter smiles He knows a shark when he sees one
CUT TO
18D SAME SCENE - SOME MINUTES LATER 18D
Cutter Sly and Ramsay are deep in discussion
CUTTER
These are facts Over the last year
theres been a forty percent increase
in terrorist actions against Trans
Pacific Most of these incidents
occurred in-flight Most of them
could have been prevented
RAMSAY
How
CUTTER
By doing what the Israelis do
having trained security specialists
ride shotgun on all international
and coast-to-coast flights
RAMSAY
I hope you arent suggesting we put
armed guards on our planes Our
passengers would never stand for it
CUTTER
Im not talking about armed guards
Im talking about trained counter-
terrorists -- disguised as
passengers Their identities would be
known only to the flight crew You
want to stop terrorism
CUTTER (CONTD)
Then you gotta send a message Let
the terrorists know youre not afraid
to fight back
RAMSAY
(amused)
Maybe we could use it as an
advertising gimmick Fly Trans
Pacific -- Well Get You There
Alive
(a friendly smile)
John air travel is supposed to be
a pleasant and relaxing experience
We dont want the public to think
their lives are in danger every time
they get on a plane
CUTTER
But their lives are in danger
Cutter knows this only too well Ramsay considers for a
moment
RAMSAY
(turns to Sly)
He doesnt pull his punches does he
What do you think
SLY
Im with John Ive worked up some
numbers and its not as expensive as
you might think Not in the long run

RAMSAY
Well you guys are the experts but
it seems kind of extreme to me
CUTTER

Terrorism is a growth industry
Mister Ramsay It should be your
number one priority

RAMSAY
I can understand why you feel that
way
CUTTER
You can
RAMSAY
Youve been a victim of terrorism
yourself
Caught slightly off-guard Cutter turns to Sly
SLY
I told him about Lisa
RAMSAY

Im very sorry for your loss I know
its got to be painful
Cutter nods remains stoic

CUTTER
Its been two years Im not over it
-- I never will be -- but I can talk

about it now Yeah Im a victim of
terrorism Pan International Flight
107 The ironic part is I wasnt on
a job I was on my honeymoon We were
halfway to Buenos Aires when a bomb
went off in the cargo hold One
second were making jokes about the
lousy food The next

(too painful stick to the facts
One hundred and forty-two people lost
their lives Twenty-seven survived
They tell me I was lucky but the
truth is a big part of me died in
that crash

RAMSAY

I apologize I know this is a
sensitive area But I have to know if
your own experience has made you a

bit over-zealous when it comes to
airline security
CUTTER

If anything its made me realize that
terrorism isnt something that only
happens to other people It can
happen to any of us at any time
RAMSAY
I appreciate your honesty One more
question and were through
(a slight beat)
Do you always travel by train
Sly sits up like hes been stuck with a red-hot poker How the
hell did Ramsay know that Even Cutter looks perplexed
until he follows Ramsays eyes to the Amtrak brochure poking
out of his breast pocket Cutter removes it playing for time
CUTTER
You mean this
SLY
(butting in)
I thought I told you Cutter took the
train so he could have time to relax
and work on his presentation But
hes returning to LA tonight -- by
air
(giving Cutter a strained look)
The six oclock flight I believe
CUTTER
(playing along)
Right The six oclock
RAMSAY
Well thats a relief
(joking)
We wouldnt want to hire an airlines
security specialist whos afraid to
fly
SLY
(laughing)
Wed have to be pretty crazy to doa
thing like that
CUTTER
Stark raving mad
Ramsays WATCH goes BEEP
RAMSAY
Guys Im late

(standing)
John -- most impressive Sly and I
will run your ideas by Addison Cale
and see what the old man thinks I
hope the next time I see you will be
to welcome you on board

(they shake hands)
Have a nice flight

CUTTER

Thanks

But Ramsay is gone Cutter and Sly exchange uneasy smiles

SLY

You think he bought it
CUTTER

Hes an asshole but hes not a fool
SLY

I know him Hell check to see if
youre on the plane Id better make
you a reservation
(calling to a waiter)

SLY
(as if betrayed)

I agreed to come here and take a
meeting Thats all Nobody said

the rear of the plane where he finds an unoccupied lavoratory

Cutter bolts the door He stares at himself in the mirror A
nervous stranger stares back
In this tiny space the SOUND OF the PLANE only increases
Cutters discomfort He reaches into his pocket and takes out
his DISC MAN He puts on the earphones punches play and
cranks it Loud R and B MUSIC drowns out the plane ambiance and
Cutter closes his eyes trying to get into the music hoping
it will help him forget where he is

The Indian nods solemnly He puts the grenade in his pocket
Wolfgang turns and addresses the passengers
WOLFGANG
Good news In just a minute half of

Excited reactions Some faces like Martis are wary

WOLFGANG
After weve been refueled the rest
of you will follow Now whod like

to be in the group that goes first
As anticipated every hand in the cabin shoots up Wolfgang
hides a smile
WOLFGANG
You cant all go first
Clamoring and shouting as individuals plead for Wolfgangs
attention To him their begging is better than an orgasm
Marti whos seen enough stands up

Stop it Dont beg him Cant you see

look He walks down the aisle to her Marti defiantly stands

Marti refuses Wolfgang considers withdraws the gun --and
points it at the nearest person -- a mother with a small child
in an aisle seat Its the kid with the teddy bear
MARTI

Please -- dont--

Wolfgang closes his eyes feeling a rush of pleasure He
lowers the gun and opens his eyes They gleam at Marti who
feels like shes been raped

WOLFGANG
Thank you Marti You were very

getting more Street by the second He begins to struggle
between the Two Cops who are overweight country boys

brace him and try to get the cuffs on

COP 1
Hold still

CUTTER
Hold this

(fumbling with the handcuffs)
I cant see a goddamn thing Get him
back in the light
Taking advantage of the situation and the bad light Cutter
suddenly whips around catching the Cops off guard A couple
of lightning fast moves and -- snap click The two Cops are
handcuffed to each other
Theyre so amazed that Cutter is easily able to push them
over Floundering off-balance the Two Cops tumble to the
floor tangled together thrashing to get free
As they struggle to get up Cutter grabs one of their guns and
aims it at them COCKING back the TRIGGER The Two Cops freeze
in terror The look on Cutters face is murderous

Please dont kill us
Cutters murderous look vanishes replaced by his regular
look of cool calculating intelligence

he races down the corridor responding to the OS NOISE of

A series of THUMPING sounds comes from the Janitors closet as
the Two Cops try to break out Suddenly the door shatters and
they come tumbling out
128 EXT RUNWAY 128
Cutter moves through a wave of humanity as passengers continue
to de-plane Its a madhouse scene so theres little chance of
Cutter being discovered in the middle of it
Cutter stops He stands very still like an island in the
middle of a sea of swarming moving people Hes got his radar
out It may be a madhouse but Cutters trained eye picks up
something out of whack -- something in the distance that sends
a jolt through his body

Four passengers have broken away from the crowd and are
hurrying off in the opposite direction crossing a grassy
field in the direction of the fairgrounds As they pass the

moonlight stroll
Cutters first instinct is to chase after them but its too
hard -- hes already being swept back by the pushing shoving
passengers Maybe he can find a way to intercept them

toward the terminal At the last moment he breaks away and
disappears around the side of the building

effectively disguised in the leather jacket
A LOUD SCREAM Cutter reacts but its only a couple of
teenagers on the ferris wheel Cutter continues on pushing
through the dense crowd The gun in his pocket is a reassuring
weight but hes clearly worried Wolfgang and innocent people
are a lethal combination
We RACK FOCUS Behind Cutter Wolfgang steps out of a
telephone booth Like a shark he glides silently up behind
Cutter and ever so gently pokes his gun into Cutters back
Cutter stiffens

Lovely night Lets go for a walk

Cutter does as hes told wondering how the hell Wolfgang
recognized him

wearing a neon sign
They walk past a distortion mirror Cutter glances at his
reflection and sees that the back of his leather jacket is
decorated with big letters that spell out ARYAN ARMY

from your pocket and drop it into the

hesitation and Ill blow a hole

bystanders

Im sure youre hopelessly tied to
some sense of morality Were not
really that different you and me
Were both killers
CUTTER
The people Ive killed were scum
They had it coming The people you
kill are innocent

WOLFGANG
Innocent Who says theyre innocent
Im surprised at you Cutter Havent

A bigger gasp This attracts the attention of other people
strolling the midway They drift over to see whats going on

is Wolfgang feels his power slipping away

for being a phoney bidder He gives Cutter a deadly look
Cutter returns it with a look of his own Wolfgang turns and
takes off with Fiona

AUCTIONEER

What about you friend Youre still

at two hundred
Cutter may have solved one problem but in doing so hes
created another In the crowd Cutter sees the Burly Airport

Cop -- the one he beat up Uh oh The Burly Cop sees Cutter
and signals the other Cops to close in

Three hundred
The Cajun girl looks at her pie Three hundred dollars It
never occurs to her that this is a bluff

Come on now Funs fun but were
talking about a pie
The Cops are all around Cutter He realizes his only avenue of
escape is the stage itself
CUTTER

Youre right Let me get a better
look at it
Cutter leaps up on the stage Thats it The Cops have had
enough Guns come out Wrong move The crowd panics as the
Cops rush the stage
Without fear the Cajun girl steps up happily to offer her pie

Wolfgang grabs the child by the back of his T-shirt lifts him
out of the saddle In the center ring the ride operator sees
Wolfgang the child and Wolfgangs gun Terrified he panics
and yanks the brake -- too fast

and cling to their horses for dear life

races to the madly spinning carousel He throws himself on
board and smashes into a horse He bounces off crashes into
another horse and is knocked around like a pinball

Wolfgang is thrown forward against a pole He loses his grip
on the boy who drops to the spinning platform and rolls toward
the edge The ground beyond is a dangerous blur The boy is
just about to roll off when Cutter dives INTO FRAME He grabs
the boy just in time and pulls him back to safely
CUTTER
(to the terrified boy)
Youre okay
WOLFGANG
You shouldve let him fall
Wolfgang is now standing over them one hand clinging to a
striped pole for support the other clutching the gun -- aimed
at Cutter and the boy Cutter cocks his leg and kicks the pole
Wolfgang is using for support The pole splinters and Wolfgang
loses his balance He falls off the ride
ANGLE
Wolfgang hits the ground and rolls for several yards The gun
flies out of his hand It skitters across the dirt and
Wolfgang lunges after it like it was a life line As his
fingers close around the gun stock a foot comes down
trapping hand and gun
Wolfgang looks up The foot belongs to FBI Agent Henderson He
is flanked by Commandos whose assault rifles are pointed at
Wolfgangs head

WOLFGANG

and slap adhesive tape over his mouth to keep him quiet

Wolfgang nods politely Some other time
HENDERSON
Tell us what we want to know and it
might help you down the line
Henderson reaches up and tears the adhesive from Wolfgangs
mouth
WOLFGANG
(rapid fire)
The information you seek is this
There is one man on board the plane
and he has a grenade -- a grenade
powerful enough to wipe out everyone
onboard He has no intention of
flying the plane The refueling was
merely a ruse to buy us escape time
When the plane is attacked he will
detonate the device The man is
willing to die for me In fact hes
looking forward to it Gentlemen he
will kill everyone on board that
plane unless

gift The gift of pain
Wolfgang starts down the aisle then stops abruptly In the
faint light he can see that the figure isnt Cutter -- its
the dead Indian Cutter had propped him up
Something comes out of the darkness behind Wolfgang Its
Cutter -- sailing over the middle seats He crashes down on
Wolfgang and they go sprawling in a tangle of fists and
kicking legs

CUTTER
(as they struggle)
Its payback time motherfucker
Cutter punches Wolfgang in the face and smashes his gun hand
with the baseball bat The gun goes skittering down the aisle
Cutter throws the bat aside and lays into Wolfgang with his
fists
CUTTER
(as he punches andpunches)
You hear me Im paying it back All
of it All the pain you sick
bastard
Wolfgang jabs a thumb into Cutters eye and rolls free Both
men leap to their feet and face each other assuming martial
arts stances

WOLFGANG
You think Im sick The world is
sicker
CUTTER
You dont like it Leave
WOLFGANG
(polite)

After you I insist
Wolfgang attacks like lightning Talk about fists of fury
This guy is good Cutter expertly blocks Wolfgangs blows but
a lucky roundhouse kick catches him under the chin and snaps
his head back Cutter is staggered Blood trickles from his
nose Wolfgang smiles
WOLFGANG

Youre the one who doesnt belong

Times have changed There are more of

me in the world than there are you

Face it Cutter Heroes are out of

style
CUTTER
I hear theyre making a comeback
Now Cutter attacks -- and if youve been looking forward to

seeing Wolfgang get his ass kicked this is it Cutter pulls
out every trick in his martial arts bag Wolfgang is kicked
punched and knocked around the cabin rendered helpless by
Cutters murderous onslaught

Wolfgang falls back against a row of seats His face is a
bloody map He looks up at Cutter and grins through red teeth

WOLFGANG
(a hiss)
More
CUTTER
You got it

Cutter wades into Wolfgang pummeling and punching him down
the aisle Wolfgang falls gets up is knocked down again and
again Cutter closes in for the kill
WOLFGANG
Come on hero Finish me
Cutter hesitates Hes never seen anyone derive this kind of
pleasure from pain
WOLFGANG
Whatre you waiting for I blew up
that plane I killed all those
people
CUTTER
(long murderous look
You killed my wife
WOLFGANG
(a rush of pleasure)
Thank you I didnt know
Thats when Fiona appears behind Cutter having sneaked up on
the elevator She raises her gun to blow his brains out But
Cutter sees her reflected in Wolfgangs cold eves
Cutter ducks as Fiona FIRES The BULLET WHIZZES past him and
hits Wolfgang in the shoulder Cutter spins around and
dispatches Fiona with a kick that breaks her neck Shes dead
before she hits the floor
Cutter picks up Fionas gun and turns back to Wolfgang but
Wolfgang is gone Hes scrambling away and diving into the
next aisle He grabs his fallen GUN and OPENS FIRE on Cutter
WOLFGANG
(shouting as he FIRES)
One of us dies hero Its the only
way
Cutter ducks as BULLETS SPRAY the overhead storage bins
Cutter FIRES back at Wolfgang The BULLETS miss and EXPLODE
one of the Plexiglas passenger windows causing the cabin to
depressurize
The cabin fills with debris Magazines cups etc go flying
Oxygen masks drop from the ceiling
Wolfgang closest to the window is lifted off his feet and
sucked backwards To keep from being sucked out the window he
drops his gun and grabs the head rest of a seat with both
hands
Cutter is buffeted by the decompression Plates and utensils
pour out of the galley Cutter ducks as they soar past him
The overhead projector module drops from the ceiling and the
in-flight movie begins The Wamer Brothers logo flickers on
214 EXT 747 214
zooming above the dark Mississippi delta We see objects
spewing out the open window
215 INT 747 - MAIN CABIN 215
Dodging flying debris Cutter makes his way to Wolfgang
Wolfgang is barely able to hang on Its as though the
shattered window is a gaping sucking mouth and it wants
Wolfgang
A fork flies out of nowhere and embeds itself in Wolfgangs
forehead He screams and his fingers begin to lose purchase on
the headrest In a moment hell be sucked out if Cutter
doesnt do something
WOLFGANG
(begging)
Cutter help me
CUTTER
Take my hand
Cutter offers his hand
In desperation Wolfgang grabs it and comes away with the
grenade -- the detonating pin dangling from the end of
Cutters finger Cutter smiles grimly With a look of betrayed
horror Wolfgang is sucked out of the jet and into the HOWLING
night
WOLFGANG
(screaming)
Cutterrrrrrr
216 EXT NIGHT SKY - 747 216
The grenade goes off blowing a bright red hole in the night
sky The jet untouched continues on its way

CUTTER

219 INT 747 - FLIGHT DECK 219
Priest turns to Marti his hands going slack on the yoke On
his face a sad rictus smile
PRIEST
Gotta go now
Priest slumps dead across the yoke causing the plane to go
into a steep dive Screams and pandemonium Everyone and
everything is thrown forward

Before Marti can act a powerful hand grabs Priest and pulls
him off the yoke and out of the pilots seat Its Cutter He
slides behind the controls grabs the yoke and with a mighty
effort straightens out the plane
MARTI
(relieved)
Where have you been
CUTTER
I had to throw out the trash
They share a smile Then back to the problem at hand
MARTI
Can you land one of these
Cutter stares at the intimidating lights and gauges of the
control console

if Sly made that announcement
Ramsay looks like hes just been hit in the face with a bag of
shit
RAMSAY

from him and is smiling in Slys direction with fatherly
fondness

Then Cutter sees something up ahead He takes Martis arm and
they hurry along
CUTTER
