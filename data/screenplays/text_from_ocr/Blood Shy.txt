OVER BLACK - A door bell CHIMES then an urgent KNOCK KNOCK

INT DUKE RESIDENCE FOYER - NIGHT

KYLE looks every inch the hardcore punk rocker he wishes
he was down to his bug-eyed pallor and tattoos Right now
he holds bloody gauze to his bare chest and hustles to answer
the door in a house financed with three gold records

He opens the door for two Paramedics Lean MARCUS with
wire-hanger shoulders is swift but pro like an army field
medic working for a living His partner beefy SEBASTIAN is Florence Nightingale in a linebacker’s body

KYLE
You guys got here fast

MARCUS
Glad you think so Have a seat
let’s have a look

KYLE
Not me She’s in the bathroom

INT BATHROOM - NIGHT

NIKKI spurns Avril Lavigne for being a hack but steals
her look anyway Usually she’s a mosh pit catcall but
tonight she’s unconscious on the bathroom floor pale and
surrounded by blood smears and rags

Kyle leads the EMTs in Marcus kneels beside her

KYLE
She passed out hit her head I
think

MARCUS
She bleeding

KYLE
Blood’s mine Kinda panicked
both of us

MARCUS
What’s her name

KYLE
Nikki

MARCUS

paramedic Look at me honey

Nikki starts to come to
MARCUS

KYLE

NIKKT
(trying to focus on Marcus)
Who the fuck are you

KYLE

NIKKI
Goddammit

MARCUS
(holding up two fingers)
How many fingers am I holding up

NIKKI
Gin

Marcus cocks an eyebrow

KYLE

MARCUS
Two fingers of gin Haven’t

KYLE

drinking at all

MARCUS

KYLE
(snagged)
Um no
MARCUS

Okay honey can you sit up
Sebastian looks at Kyle’s blood-smeared chest

SEBASTIAN
Let me look at that

KYLE
Not til I know she’s okay

Marcus tries to help Nikki sit up
MARCUS
Look at me Right here
(checking her eyes with a light)
How do you feel

NIKKT
(dazed)
Where’s Billy Is he okay

KYLE
I’m right here I’m fine

SEBASTIAN
Well get to him

NIKKT
My head What happened

MARCUS
Id say you fainted and bumped
your head No signs of
concussion Probably just a
bruise and a big ass headache

KYLE
I’m sorry baby I thought you
were having a seizure or a heart
attack or-

Nikki still groggy spots Kyle He’s not who she expected
to see but she tries to hide her surprise

NIKKI
Oh right

KYLE
I was worried I’m sorry This
is all my fault

SEBASTIAN
Yeah I’m kinda curious about the
prologue here

NIKKI
Do you have to file a report
MARCUS
Only if I want to keep my job
NIKKI
I’m not good with blood Makes
me woozy
MARCUS

Makes you faint apparently
Think you can stand up
He helps her up she stumbles Kyle helps stabilize her

MARCUS
There it is all right

NIKKT
What’d you say your name was

MARCUS
I’m Marcus That’s Sebastian
Youre gonna be fine Just take
it slow Drink some water A
lot of water

SEBASTIAN
(re Kyle’s wound)
You going to let me look at that
now

NIKKI
Youre still bleeding

KYLE
Baby I was more worried about
you

NIKKT
Aw

MARCUS

Youd rather bleed to death than
have her sleep it off Adorable
Come on show time

Kyle starts to peel back the gauze but flinches

MARCUS
Stuck

KYLE
It’s stuck

NIKKI
Oh god

Nikki teeters Sebastian helps her settle on the floor

MARCUS
How long’s the gauze been there

KYLE
Supposed to be non-stick

MARCUS
Yeah Twenty minutes
KYLE
Maybe more
(gives it tug flinches)
Fuck Goddamn that’s some pain

MARCUS
Yeah
(to Sebastian)
Kit
SEBASTIAN
On it
(to Nikki)

You good
Nikki nods Sebastian exits Kyle plucks at the gauze

KYLE
Holy shit man that fucking
hurts Worse than when it
happened

MARCUS
Yeah the blood started to
coagulate in the fibers of the
gauze like early scab tissue
Non-stick or not you’re
basically ripping an open wound

ON SEBASTIAN

Passing the KITCHEN he notices an 8-inch CHEF’S KNIFE on the
floor blood on the blade and spattered about

BACK TO BATHROOM

KYLE
Just like a band-aid man just
gotta rip it off all at once

MARCUS
Not just like a band-aid I
wouldn’t do that

KYLE
Just a quick rip no big deal
right

MARCUS

No wait I’ve seen people do
that and the pain is so bad-

Kyle yanks the gauze away with a GRUNT A flare of pain
lights up his face and he passes out cold

MARCUS
-they pass out
Blood streams from Kyle’s chest

MARCUS
Dumb son of a bitch

THUD behind Marcus Nikki fainted again

Sebastian returns with a kit sees the aftermath

SEBASTIAN
He rip it off Dumb son of a
bitch

MARCUS

They never listen Salts
Sebastian passes him the smelling salts

SEBASTIAN
Weapon’s in the kitchen

MARCUS
Wild guess Chef’s knife

SEBASTIAN
Looked like German steel
blackwood handle

MARCUS
Thank you Emeril

SEBASTIAN
It’s a nice knife Wish I could
afford one

MARCUS
Come on kids up and at ‘em

Kyle and Nikki sniff the salts start to rouse

MARCUS
Get her out of this bloodbath
while I clean up Sid Vicious
here

Sebastian helps her up and out of the bathroom
Marcus cleans Kyle’s wound

KYLE
Goddamn I never passed out
before I mean not from pain

MARCUS
That’s a good slice Let’s get
you stitched up
KYLE
No way No hospitals

MARCUS

wife another reason to faint

INT KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

Nikki starts into the kitchen but stops when she sees the
knife and blood suddenly light-headed

NIKKI

As Nikki slowly bends to the knife the back of her shirt
rides up revealing BRUISES ON HER BACK

She can’t bear to touch the knife turns away from it

INT LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Before Nikki can slap Kyle five kinds of purple Marcus and
Sebastian return with gear see the cash

MARCUS

Marcus cleans the wound Sebastian preps a syringe

MARCUS
I can give you a shot for the
pain but I don’t have the good

KYLE

NIKKI

Marcus gestures to Sebastian who preps another syringe

KYLE
What’s that

SEBASTIAN
Secret sauce

MARCUS

be stage-diving in no time

With his back to the group Sebastian pulls a fast-food HOT
SAUCE PACKET out of his shirt pocket jabs it with the
syringe and draws from it He hands the syringe to Marcus
who leans toward Kyle

KYLE
Wait I just I never had
stitches before

MARCUS
What happened to punk rock Your
anesthetic isn’t taking so I’m
sending in reinforcements
NIKKT
Okay I’m gonna go throw up for a
while

She wobbles out of the room

MARCUS
How far along is she

KYLE
Two or three months I just
found out

SEBASTIAN
You hit her before or after you
found out

KYLE
Hey not cool bro I would
never do that

MARCUS
There’s a whole lot going on in
this house I don’t understand

KYLE
For ten grand you owe me a whole
lotta not understanding

MARCUS
Exactly You got your reasons
and now we got ten thousand of
our own to forget this hour of
our lives Whatever happens
never happened I keep thinking
about it and I keep coming back
to one thing

Marcus inserts the needle into the wound Deep

MARCUS
Chick went into a room and pulled
out ten grand in cash like she
was getting her coat

KYLE
(feeling the needle)
Ooh ow OW

MARCUS
There it is Okay So Uh
Bad news my friend

Kyle looks at Marcus anxiously utterly vulnerable
MARCUS
I need to tell you something but
you gotta relax for a minute
Stay still now calm We good

KYLE
Wait

MARCUS
This isn’t anesthetic

Kyle squirms

MARCUS
Shhh still okay You really

MARCUS
Secret sauce is funny but we
didn’t have burgers for dinner
Tacos Well I had tacos
Sebastian had a a what

SEBASTIAN
An enchilarito

MARCUS
So Sebastian here he draws a
syringe from a hot sauce packet

Sebastian tosses the empty packet on the stack of cash

KYLE
Fuck Oh fuck

MARCUS
Easy now One slip and I squirt
fire into this choice pulmonary
vein I got here Take about a
second to blast into your heart
You know what that’1ll feel like

KYLE
What the hell man

MARCUS
Yeah me neither I haven’t read
any studies about shooting hot
sauce into a human heart

Nikki returns shields her eyes

NIKKT
I was really hoping you’d be done

by now
KYLE
Baby-
MARCUS
Shhh shhh
(to Nikki)

I was just giving your husband
the prognosis

Nikki sees the needle in Kyle’s chest feels his panic

NIKKI
What is this

MARCUS
I need to tell you something but
be cool because if you freak
out I might make an ugly
mistake Got it

Marcus fingers the syringe Kyle sweats and twitches

MARCUS
It’s important -- very important
okay -- that we all stay calm

Have a seat
Nikki sits nervously watches Kyle under the syringe

MARCUS
I’m not going to pretend this
isn’t about money It very much
is But I want you to know that
we aren’t bad people me and
Sebastian We’re just hard-
working family guys in the red
trying to make up for state
cutbacks Seems to me you got
money to spare and your only debt
is the effort you owe to earn
what you already have so we’re
gonna balance our books here

NIKKI
What’s in there

MARCUS
A barrel full of Gimme All Your
Money

NIKKI

No You have it already That’s
everything

MARCUS
A chick with ten grand just
laying around the house has more
than just ten grand laying around
the house

NIKKT
That was rainy day money That’s
all there is

MARCUS
Honey there’s a category five
shitstorm about to make landfall
in your living room

(to Kyle)

How about you Billy Want to
tell us where the piggy bank is
or do we make your heart explode
in your chest

NIKKI
He doesn’t know where it is
(beat)
Where we used to keep it

MARCUS
See there we go Why don’t you
go for a little walk with
Sebastian while Billy and I hang
out here

She turns sees Sebastian standing behind her gesturing with
the bloody chef’s knife like Let’s Go

KYLE
Go Go

NIKKT
When you don’t find anything
youll go away

MARCUS
Well see

Nikki hesitantly leads Sebastian out of the living room

KYLE
So when this is over you gonna
stitch me up right Cause man
I gotta get something outta this
and this slot in my chest is
starting to really upset me

INT HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Sebastian walks Nikki at knife point down the hall

NIKKT
Stop pointing that thing at me
You’re making me nervous

SEBASTIAN
You can’t even see me

NIKKT
I know you’re pointing a fucking
knife at my back and you’re
making me fucking nervous

She stops at a closed door opens it to darkness

SEBASTIAN
Basement Think I’m stupid

NIKKI
Yes very but the safe is in the
basement and we keep the money
in the safe so we’re going in
the basement

SEBASTIAN
There a light switch

Nikki flicks on a light
NIKKI

Pussy

INT BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS

Nikki leads Sebastian downstairs to a small basement with a
crappy steel desk water heater rotten old loveseat dozens
of music posters taped over the walls

NIKKI
Behind the poster

SEBASTIAN
Ladies first

She pulls down a Butthole Surfers poster revealing a SAFE

Sebastian gestures to the safe with the knife Nikki takes
deep breath works the combination

CLICK Nikki steps out of Sebastian’s way
SEBASTIAN
Nuh uh How do I know it isn’t

booby trapped

Nikki fights to not hyperventilate

a

Sebastian pokes her gently in the back with the knife
SEBASTIAN
And to think just ten minutes
ago I gave a rat’s ass about
your safety
Nikki opens the safe to STACKS OF CASH Sebastian smiles

She reaches into the safe into the shadows over the cash

And whips out a 357 MAGNUM REVOLVER spins toward Sebastian
cocks it It’s a big gun for her little hand

NIKKT
Drop the fucking knife or Ill
I’1l blast your fucking head off
SEBASTIAN
Duchess I’ve drained abscesses
more threatening than you

Unperturbed Sebastian takes off his yellow EMT jacket

NIKKI
What are you doing

SEBASTIAN

Take it easy I just want to

show you something
Sebastian calmly slices his own arm with the knife
Blood runs down his arm puddling on the floor
Nikki’s eyes widen
And she faints dead away When her hand hits the ground the
gun FIRES into the wall

INT LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

The 0OS gun shot startles Kyle and Marcus

A split second’s inventory assures that Marcus didn’t
accidentally inject Kyle so Kyle seizes the moment and
lunges shoving Marcus and the syringe over the coffee table

Kyle grabs the biggest coffee table book you ever saw - “PUNK
ROCK ALL THE SHITTY PICTURES” - and CLOBBERS Marcus with it

Marcus hits the floor Kyle pins him hoists the book over
his head to smash Marcus’s skull when-

Another GUN SHOT this one in the room

Kyle turns to see Sebastian with the gun pointed at him a
HOLE in the ceiling above him and a limp Nikki and his EMT
jacket slung over his shoulder

Kyle drops the book Sebastian flops both Nikki and the
jacket on the floor

SEBASTIAN
You all right

KYLE
I’m bleeding again

Sebastian SHOOTS the floor next to Kyle

SEBASTIAN
Not you asshole

MARCUS
Jesus where’d you get a gun

SEBASTIAN
Chick thought she was clever
pulled it from the safe

MARCUS
Is she

SEBASTIAN
Just passed out

He displays his slashed arm Hefts the pistol

SEBASTIAN
Damn haven’t held one of these
in a while

Sebastian BLASTS one of the framed gold records to bits

MARCUS
Cut it out You want somebody to
hear

Marcus applies a large bandage to Sebastian’s wound

SEBASTIAN
These two are so punked out they
probably wake the neighbors when
they brush their teeth

MARCUS
Find the money

SEBASTIAN
Gonna need a bag for all that
cash
Marcus regards the surrounding punk decadence

MARCUS
Why stop there
(to Kyle)
Where do you keep the duct tape

KYLE
I don’t know

Sebastian puts the barrel of the gun in Kyle’s face

SEBASTIAN
The fuck you don’t

KYLE
I don’t know I don’t know

SEBASTIAN
Well where’s the tools and shit

KYLE
Fuck man I don’t know

SEBASTIAN
How does the man of the house not
know where the fucking tools are

NIKKT
We don’t have any duct tape

Nikki sits up ragged Sebastian is dumbfounded

SEBASTIAN
Who doesn’t have duct tape

NIKKT
What do I need duct tape for

SEBASTIAN
It’s got a thousand uses
Everybody needs duct tape

NIKKT
Now you know what to get me for
Christmas

MARCUS

Okay shut up everybody

(to Kyle and Nikki)
Do you have any restraining
materials similar to but not
precisely duct tape Rope
maybe Fishing line

NIKKI
Maybe in the garage

SEBASTIAN
(brightening)
Fuck the garage
CUT TO

Sebastian wraps Nikki and Kyle together standing back-to-back
with surgical tubing from a spool like a double mummy

KYLE
Goddamn this is some tight shit

Marcus ties it off leaving Kyle and Nikki tottering
precariously on bunched feet Sebastian eyes Nikki

Nikki spits in his face He gives her a light shove She
falls backward Kyle slams face first into the floor

SEBASTIAN
Hold that thought

Marcus and Sebastian head down the hall

MARCUS
Master bedroom

SEBASTIAN
That way I got the safe

ON NIKKI AND KYLE They can hear rummaging OS

KYLE

KYLE (CONTD)

gonna die I’m gonna fucking die
as a fucking roadie for Billy’s
band which I fucking cofounded
tied up to the girl Billy stole
from me in Billy’s house
surrounded by bits of Billy’s
gold fucking record

NIKKT

Get it all out Feel better

KYLE

Just tell me one thing If it
was up to you who the father is
who would you pick Me or him

Nikki sees the shards of the shattered gold record frame
and glass on the floor nearby

NIKKT

Roll with me

Huh

KYLE

NIKKT

I have an idea My direction
over the top of me okay

Kyle heaves his weight up and they roll a couple times

toward the shards

NIKKT

Wiggle up a bit like a worm

They inch into position Nikki rubs against a large jagged
shard scraping one section of tubing

From here Kyle has a clear view down the hall

Nikki scrapes One tube snaps

She thrashes but the tubes don’t budge She accidently
BUMPS the coffee table As if in reaction the rummaging

sounds stop

KYLE

Not good

She scrapes faster

More tubes snap

NIKKT

Okay got it done out

They wiggle loose and shed the tubes Nikki uses the shard
to cut the tubes binding their feet

Freedom Kyle grabs Nikki spins her to face him

KYLE
I love you Nikki

NIKKT
I love you Kyle

Sebastian comes around the corner sees them free

SEBASTIAN
What the fuck

Kyle BELLOWS and launches himself at Sebastian

Sebastian raises the gun Kyle knocks it aside and slams him
against the wall

The revolver skitters away Nikki snatches it
Marcus rounds the corner grabs at Nikki’s gun hand
But his own hand partially covers the barrel

BOOM Blood sprays from Marcus’s hand He YELPS staggers
into the other room

Nikki stumbles from the kick of the gun drops it
Kyle swipes it whirls on Sebastian rushing up
Fires BOOM

Misses Sebastian stops cold throws his hands up
defensively but Kyle is all adrenaline and

BOOM
Misses again
BOOM

The bullet drills Sebastian’s forehead torques his neck
back tosses his body backward out of the hallway

into the Living Room hits the hardwood floor flat-backed
like a thunderclap

just as Marcus comes back chef’s knife in hand

Sebastian’s body in front of him blood pooling beneath He
drops the knife with a CLATTER and bolts

Kyle hears the front door SLAM SHUT

EXT DUKE RESIDENCE - NIGHT

Shirtless bleeding Kyle runs out across the lush lawn gun
in hand but the ambulance PEELS OUT and takes off

INT DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Dining Room is just off the Living Room Nikki sits at the
table struggling to keep her shit together Kyle steps over
Sebastian’s body sits by Nikki sets the gun on the table

They share a stunned silence dazedly regaining rationality

KYLE
You look good

NIKKI

KYLE

NIKKI
To take him I mean I think

KYLE

NIKKI

NIKKI

KYLE

He kisses her neck gently

NIKKI
Youre bleeding

KYLE
I’m clotting

He sidles up to her lips to make amends and she lets him
They look into each other’s eyes struggling whether to
scream or whisper He kisses her hard clasps her hands in
his against the overpriced wood

Abruptly she yanks her left hand away suddenly freaked

She twists and bolts out of the room

Kyle sighs and hangs his head

INT MASTER BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

The bedroom has been tossed like a Cobb salad Kyle enters
to find Nikki frantically groping through the aftermath

NIKKI
No no no

KYLE
What are you looking for
She wavers

NIKKT

‘em

KYLE

And my engagement ring I always
take them off when I’m with you
You probably never even noticed

KYLE
But come on do they really mean

stunned by her own inability to answer that

KYLE
Just tell him they took ‘em in
the robbery-

NIKKT

The robbery that happened when my
secret lover called 911 after I
stabbed him cause he was gonna
rat us out to force a paternity
test That fucking robbery

Marcus’s SEVERED PINKY FINGER blown off in the gun blast
She gasps shrinks against the wall slides to the floor
But then something else catches her eye A few feet away
Marcus’s SEVERED RING FINGER

-with his WEDDING BAND near the bloody stump

And finally it all sinks in

She cracks Whimpering then bawling She pounds the floor
in exasperation

CUT TO

She scrubs the blood off the hardwood floor with soap and
water scrubbing around the finger

She scrubs blood spray off the hallway walls

Steps over and around Sebastian’s body wipes blood spatter
off furniture framed pictures knickknacks

As she wipes blood from the wall opposite the hallway she
finds a nick in the wall

A hole She peers through sees light on the other side
She looks down -- for the first time -- at Sebastian’s

punctured skull

Pulls out the SLUG that bored through Sebastian’s skull

INT LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

She sops up the blood pool around Sebastian’s head wrings it
into a bucket It’s sticky stuff

But something on Sebastian’s body catches her eye
His chest moves just so slightly He’s BREATHING
Startled she stumbles backward

Sebastian’s head is undeniably ruptured Has to at least be
brain dead But what if he’s not

She pulls out her cell phone speed dials Kyle

INT LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Nikki stands in the doorway half hiding looking out at
Sebastian’s barely breathing body She eyes the chef’s knife
on the floor where Marcus dropped it

She tries calling Kyle again Voicemail She hangs up

She ducks into the kitchen returns and tosses a spoon at
Sebastian Hits him in the leg no reaction

Grabs a large candle hefts it tosses it THUMP into
Sebastian’s chest but no reaction

Distraught she shakes her head with indecision

INT KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

She looks around Grabs the glass bowl off a blender holds
it as if to swing but it’s awkward and she puts it down

Picks up a bottle of gin hefts it like a club But instead
opens it starts to take a slug but stops

when the trash bin catches her eye

INT LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Nikki cautiously approaches Sebastian Kneels behind his
head his body extending away from her

Looks at his upsidedown face beneath her his chest slowly
rising and falling She sets the chef’s knife nearby

She pulls out a PLASTIC TRASH BAG and whips it over his head
and neck clumsily squeezing air out pressing the plastic
against his nose and mouth

Quickly she pulls out a length of the rubber tubing she was
bound with loops it around his neck and the bag ties a
double knot seals the plastic around his throat

She clutches the knife and she scoots backwards away away
waiting for the worst

But Sebastian’s body does not thrash He does not stir
The air in the bag expands and contracts with his breathing

Rhythm becomes more staccato the plastic sucked deeper into
his mouth and parts of his body twitch

The bag stops moving His chest stops moving

Nikki exhales

He sees a flicker of panic in her eyes

KYLE

Nikki looks away allowing Kyle to believe that

KYLE
(to Zach)

instinct hasn’t gone anywhere

ZACH
I don’t think I like where this
is going

KYLE

Baby kitchen’s over there think
you can find a knife for me

NIKKI
Think I can manage

Nikki goes to the kitchen

KYLE

(to Liz)
If you call Marcus and beg him to
come back in his current
condition that shit ain’t
happening

(to Zach)
But you you’re as good as a
human countdown

Nikki returns with a kitchen knife hands it to Kyle

KYLE

sidles up to Zach

KYLE

arms Gotta be some good veins

Call Marcus and tell him the
clock is ticking His son is
gonna bleed to death if he
doesn’t get back here to stitch
him up

LIZ
What if he’s too far away

KYLE
Got any duct tape

Kyle reaches out with the knife to slice Zach’s bicep

Liz lunges at Kyle tackles him to the floor knocks the
knife out of his hand

Kyle flings her off slams her into the wall
They both scramble to the knife as Kyle pulls the gun
But Zach dives for the knife closest to it
And he comes up with it takes a mad swing at Kyle

Who feints and dodges Zach’s wild momentum topples him
forward

As Liz tries to spin away but

Zach stumbles and DRIVES THE KNIFE INTO HER BACK

Liz YOWLS with pain Both fall to the floor

Zach recoils in a panic skittering backward

Taking out Kyle’s legs He falls over the top of Zach
His gun hand hits the floor BANG It goes off

The bullet rips through Liz’s upper shoulder
Spraying Nikki with blood

ZACH
Oh god Oh shit

LIZ
Take it out Get it out

ZACH
I’m sorry I’m sorry

Kyle feels his chest -- no new blood

Nikki doubles over and pukes

Liz cries in pain

Zach shivers against the wall

But then a CLATTER from another room

Gets everybody’s attention All eyes down the hall

Metallic clambering noises not unlike somebody jumping on
and climbing off a washing machine

FOOTSTEPS approaching
Marcus
Lumbers toward them slowly One hand heavily wrapped in
gauze carrying a small kit CROW BAR in the other hand He
looks bad Leans over Liz
MARCUS
Remember our honeymoon that
little place near the pier with

the steamers

LIZ

MARCUS
We went three days in a row and
said we could go thirty more

LIZ

Marcus pulls the knife out with a wet suck

Liz SCREAMS Blood wells out of her back

MARCUS
When this is over we’re going
back

LIZ

What took you so long

Marcus looms over Kyle who weakly threatens with the gun
MARCUS
I’m not an expert on guns but
when I find a dusty box of fifty
bullets that’s eight short I’m
thinking one thing I replayed
it in my head Counted seven
shots fired at your house So
I’ve been waiting and wondering
if I’d hear number eight

ZACH
(to Kyle)
You’re out of bullets Penis

MARCUS
Put it down

KYLE
You know it’s empty Who cares
now

Marcus slams Kyle with the crowbar Kyle drops the gun

KYLE
Fuck

MARCUS
The one that took my fingers was
number four

Marcus picks up the gun pulls a BOX OF BULLETS from his
pocket reloads it

MARCUS
(to Zach)
You okay
ZACH

Marcus opens the kit treats Liz’s wounds

MARCUS
It’s all right You’re gonna be
okay

draining out through the hole in
his head

DIGS HIS FINGERS INTO KYLE’S WOUND

Kyle swats madly at Billy but Billy’s juiced full of crazy
He forces Kyle to his knees and TEARS THE WOUND OPEN

Kyle doubles over flesh dangling blood streaming out of his
chest puddling on the floor

A HAND snatches the gun from the back of Billy’s waistband
He spins to see Zach stumbling backward with the gun
BILLY
Fuck all tadpole Where’d you
get that
Zach pulls the trigger but the safety is on

Kyle staggers to Zach

KYLE
Give it to me

ZACH
He killed my dad

BILLY
Nah he’ll be fine He’s a
paramedic

KYLE

Come on kid Give me the gun
Reluctantly Zach gives Kyle the gun

KYLE
Safety’s on

Kyle flicks the safety off and hands the gun back to Zach
Zach sneers and aims at Billy
BILLY
None of this makes any fucking

sense

Zach OPENS FIRE on Billy pounding him backward SHOT AFTER
SHOT until the gun is empty and Billy falls

Zach drops the gun Kyle collapses
Billy struggles to ask Nikki one last question
BILLY
But Buttercup is the
baby mine

But Nikki lets his last breath pass without replying

Kyle is bleeding out and fading fast Nikki pulls herself
together goes to him

NIKKT
(to Zach)
Call 911

Zach goes to look for a phone
KYLE
Those guys are not gonna be happy

to see me

NIKKI
We made a real mess here

KYLE
I love you

NIKKT
I’m sorry I stabbed you

KYLE
Getting cold Not good

NIKKT
No baby that’s not good

KYLE
I love you
NIKKT
I loved both of you but this was
best
KYLE
What

Kyle’s eyes flutter His final seconds

NIKKI
I’1l name him or her after you

Nikki lays him down gently as life leaves Kyle
Zach staggers back in numb on autopilot

ZACH
I called

NIKKT
I’m sorry about your dad

ZACH
I’m sorry about your baby

Nikki dabs at her bloody nose

NIKKT
Baby’s fine Just a bloody nose

SIRENS approach

ZACH
What do I tell them

NIKKI
The truth The murderers are
dead

Zach turns absently and walks out
Nikki kneels uncurls Billy’s fingers retrieves her wedding

and engagement rings from his palm She slides them onto her
finger

Emergency vehicles pull up outside splashing red and blue
light through the windows washing over Nikki

She takes one last look at the horrific scene and places her
hands on her belly

NIKKI
Just drive

She exits into the red and blue light

FADE TO BLACK

THE END
