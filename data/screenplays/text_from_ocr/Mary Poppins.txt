ACT ONE

SCENE 1 CHERRY TREE LANE - Rooftop Street Parlor

1 — Prologue Bert

(London 1910 It’s autumn a dark sky scudding clouds A landscape of early
twentieth-century rooftops is spread out before us BERT a chimney sweep enters and
addresses the audience)

BERT
WIND’S IN THE EAST THERE’S A MIST COMING IN
LIKE SOMETHING IS BREWIN’ AND ‘BOUT TO BEGIN
CAN’T PUT MY FINGER ON WHAT LIES IN STORE
BUT I FEEL WHATS TO ‘APPEN ALL ‘APPENED BEFORE
(GEORGE BANKS appears out of the forest of chimneys as does his wife WINIFRED
and their tuo children JANE and MICHAEL All of them in their different ways are
disconnected and alone)
A FATHER A MOTHER A DAUGHTER A SON —
THE THREADS OF THEIR LIVES ARE ALL RAVELLING UNDONE
SOMETHING IS NEEDED TO TWIST THEM AS TIGHT
AS ASTRING YOU MIGHT USE WHEN YOURE FLYING A KITE
CHIM CHIMINEY CHIM CHIM CHER-EE CHIM CHER-OO
(MICHAEL and JANE rush around with a makeshift kite pursued by their nanny
KATIE NANNA)
MICHAEL
Hurry up Jane Lets run
KATIE NANNA
Come back here you little blighters Youve got to do your lessons
MICHAEL
T can’t do my lessons if I’m flying a kite
JANE
And you can’t make us You’re only our nanny

(The CHILDREN stamp on KATIE NANNA’s foot and succeed in losing her Their
freedom is shart-lived as they run straight into the local POLICEMAN)

POLICEMAN

Oi Not you two again Come along home Oi - come here
MARY POPPINS

(The POLICEMAN takes the CHILDREN away as BERT stops in front of No 17
Cherry Tree Lane MISS LARK is coming the other way with WILLOUGHBY her
lap-dog)

MISS LARK
Good morning Bert
BERT
Mornin’ Miss Lark and how’s little Willoughby today
MISS LARK

Oh very well thank you Bert
(WILLOUGHBY snaps at BERT)
Willoughby
(ADMIRAL BOOM enters carrying some binoculars)
ADMIRAL BOOM
By Jove is that the beauteous Miss Lark I spy on the horizon

MISS LARK
Oh Admiral

(WILLOUGHBY barks)
Willoughby

(MISS LARK giggles coquettishly and continues on her way ADMIRAL BOOM
crosses to where BERT has been watching)

BERT
Mornin’ Admiral How’s it looking

ADMIRAL BOOM

Dark clouds gathering at No 17—storm warning’s overdue

(ADMIRAL BOOM exits)

BERT
OF ALL LONDON’S BY-WAYS WHERE DOFF MY CAP
THIS ONE’S THE HARDEST TO FIND ON A MAP
CHERRY TREE LANE AS SWEET AS A SONG
BUT THE NANNIES WHO COME HERE THEY DON’T STAY FOR LONG
CHIM CHIMINEY CHIM CHIM CHER-EE CHIM CHER-OO
MaRy POPPINS - 3 -

2—Cherry Tree Lane (Part 1) Mrs Brill Winifred Robertson Ay

Jane Michael George

(BERT snaps his fingers and the interior of the house bursts into life It’s chaos KATIE
NANNA storms toward the door with her packed bags)

MRS BRILL
Katie Nanna Katie Nanna
KATIE NANNA

Those little beasts have run away from me for the last time

(MRS BRILL the cookhousekeeper bustles after KATIE NANA The house boy
ROBERTSON AY follows them)

MRS BRILL
And who gets stuck with the children with no nanny in the house Me Thats who
KATIE NANNA
Ive said my say Mrs Brill and that’s all I’ll say I’ve done with this house forever
MRS BRILL

Well good riddance then And mind you don’t stumble on your way out

(KATIE NANNA stumbles MICHAEL and JANE have run into the house
WINIFRED BANKS has appeared in time to witness KATIE NANNA storming out)

WINIFRED
Katie Nanna Where are you going Katie Nanna
MRS BRILL

KATIE NANNA’S GONE AND IS IT ANY WONDER
DRIVEN HALF DEMENTED BY YOUR CHILDREN’S PRANKS

WINIFRED

DO YOU REALLY THINK I MADE ANOTHER BLUNDER
WHAT ON EARTH AMI TO SAY TO MR BANKS

(knocks at the study door)

GEORGE DEAR

IM FEELING SO BEREFT DEAR
ANOTHER NANNY ’S LEFT DEAR
EVERY NANNY GOES

WERE UNLUCKY I SUPPOSE
MARY POPPINS

MRS BRILL ROBERTSON AY JANE MICHAEL
WE ARE NEVER GOING TO FIND THE PERFECT NANNY

(The study door flies open and GEORGE strides out)

GEORGE

Nonsense

PRECISION AND ORDER

THAT’S ALL THAT I ASK

THE RUNNING OF A HOUSEHOLD A STRAIGHTFORWARD TASK
THE CHILDREN THE SERVANTS

ARE ALL YOUR DOMAIN

WHILST I REMAIN THE SOVEREIGN OF CHERRY TREE LANE

Coat

(GEORGE holds his arms out and WINIFRED helps him into it as he continues to
berate her)

The simple truth is youve engaged six nannies in the last four months and theyve
all been unqualified disasters
A NANNY SHOULD GOVERN
A NANNY SHOULD RULE
A NANNY IS A PARAGON WHO SUFFERS NO FOOL
A NANNY’S A STALWART
OUR CHILDREN WOULD GAIN
BY HAVING SUCH A NANNY IN CHERRY TREE LANE
WINIFRED
Of course George but —
GEORGE
SO TAKE CONTROL OF SITUATIONS
SHOW YOUR AUTHORITY WHEN INTERVIEWING STAFF
YOU KNOW YOUR ROLE THEY KNOW THEIR STATIONS
EFFICIENCY AND FORETHOUGHI CUT THE JOBS IN HALF
Briefcase
(ROBERTSON AY dutifully delivers the briefcase)
WINIFRED
I thought Katie Nanna would be firm with the children She always looked so cross

GEORGE

Winifred never confuse efficiency with a liver complaint Umbrella
MARY POPPINS

(WINIFRED gives an umbrella to GEORGE)

WINIFRED

If only we could find someone like your old nanny

GEORGE

Im afraid that’s not realistic my dear Few women alive could manage Miss
Andrew’s standards of efficiency Besides we could never afford someone of her
caliber

MRS BRILL ROBERTSON AY
PRECISION AND ORDER
HE WANTS NOTHING LESS

ROBERTSON AY
IT’S LIKE AN ARMY BARRACKS—
MRS BRILL

YES AND WE’RE IN THE MESS

MRS BRILL ROBERTSON AY
NO WONDER THE NANNIES ARE DRIVEN INSANE
WERE LIVING IN A MADHOUSE IN CHERRY TREE LANE

GEORGE
Now Winifred if you do want to please me—
WINIFRED
You know I do George
GEORGE

Very well Then place an advertisement in The Times stating that Jane and Michael
Banks require the best possible nanny at the lowest possible wage

(JANE and MICHAEL have been listening from the staircase)

MICHAEL

Wed better give them ours before they make another mistake

(MICHAEL and JANE descend the stairs as GEORGE continues)

GEORGE
I would stress that—
JANE
Father
WINIFRED

Whats that youre holding dear

ur
- and MARY POPPINS

JANE
Weve written our own advertisement
GEORGE
What on—

(GEORGE is irritated by the interruption but WINIFRED notices the paper JANE 1s
carrying)
WINIFRED
Please George I think we should hear it
GEORGE
Now Winifred None of your theatrics
WINIFRED
It wont hurt to listen
JANE
Wanted A nanny For two adorable children

GEORGE
Adorable Well that’s debatable I must say

3—The Perfect Nanny Jane Michael

JANE

ROSY CHEEKS NO WARTS

MICHAEL

JANE

4—Cherry Tree Lane (Part 2) Winifred Jane Michael Mrs Brill

Robertson Ay George

GEORGE

hat’s quite enough tommy rot for one day

(GEORGE takes and tears up the advertisement and throws it in the fireplace where a

gust of wind carries it up the chimney)

Will you please go upstairs and let me get to work
Mary Poppins

(The children go)

WINIFRED
They were only trying to help
GEORGE
It wont help anyone to make me late

(The wind picks up outside)
Wheres my hat

(MRS BRILL rushes to get an overcoat while WINIFRED searches for the bowler hat)

WINIFRED
GEORGE DEAR
GEORGE

JANE MICHAEL MRS BRILL ROBERTSON AY
DO YOU THINK THEY’LL FIND A NANNY
WHO DOESNT RUN AWAY
WINIFRED
Ah There it is

(ROBERTSON AY presents GEORGE with his hat GEORGE looks at it)
MARY POPPINS

GEORGE
Hes brushed it with boot polish

(ALL “mimic” GEORGE as he reiterates his mantra)

ALL

PRECISION AND ORDER

THAT’S ALL THAT I ASK

THE RUNNING OF A HOUSEHOLD
A STRAIGHTFORWARD TASK

THE CHILDREN THE SERVANTS
ARE ALL YOUR DOMAIN

GEORGE
WHILST I REMAIN THE SOVEREIGN

Mind you use the day well
WINIFRED

GEORGE

ALL (EXCEPT GEORGE)
HE REMAINS THE SOVEREIGN
ALL
OF CHERRY TREE LANE

(The sound of wind above the house)
10 - MARY POPPINS

SCENE 2 MARY’S ARRIVAL - Parlor

(MARY POPPINS appears among them She is wearing a hat with cherries in the
brim and carrying an umbrella with a handle shaped like a parrot’s head)

MARY POPPINS
Good morning
GEORGE
(approaching MARY POPPINS)
Yes
MARY POPPINS
Ive come in answer to the advertisement
GEORGE
What advertisement We havent placed any advertisement Not yet

MARY POPPINS
George and Winifred Banks live here do they not

GEORGE
Mr and Mrs Banks live here yes

MARY POPPINS
And you are looking for a nanny
GEORGE
Well I suppose —

MARY POPPINS
Very well then Now lets see

(From her pocket MARY POPPINS takes a torn but now mended piece of paper)

“Play games all sorts” Which I most certainly can “Take us on outings give us
treats”

(GEORGE casts an uneasy look towards the CHILDREN This sounds very like but
it can’t be He stares at MARY POPPINS blankly JANE and MICHAEL listen from
the staircase)

JANE

Michael It’s our advertisement

MARY POPPINS
“Rosy cheeks and fairly pretty”

(to GEORGE)

There’s no objection on that score I hope
MARY POPPINS

GEORGE
(blushing)
Oh none at all
MARY POPPINS
I’m glad to hear it

(MARY POPPINS stares at him so firmly that for a moment it is like a ray of light
passing right through him)

GEORGE

But —oh take it up with Mrs Banks She manages all that side of things Nothing
domestic has anything to do with me And don’t forget the references

(GEORGE is gone leaving WINIFRED and the newcomer staring at each other After
a moment MARY POPPINS speaks)

MARY POPPINS
I make it a rule never to give references

WINIFRED
But I thought it was usual
MARY POPPINS
A very old-fashioned idea to my mind The best people never require them now
WINIFRED

Isee You will have every third Thursday evening off from five until nine

MARY POPPINS

The best people give every second Wednesday from six ‘til late ma’am and that is
what I shall take

WINIFRED
Oh I see well it’s all settled then

MARY POPPINS
As long as I am satisfied I’ll see the children now thank you

WINIFRED
Of course

(turns back nervously)
Youll find theyre very nice children

(JANE and MICHAEL come screaming down the stairs and stand in front of MARY
POPPINS)

Now this is oh

- 11
- 12 - MARY POPPINS

(WINIFRED is surprised to find that she has employed someone without knowing her
name)

MARY POPPINS
Mary Poppins

(For a moment MARY POPPINS looks at the CHILDREN as if she were reading their
souls They stare back)

Jane don’t stare And close your mouth Michael We are not a codfish

(But MICHAEL is not so easily conquered as he continues looking at MARY
POPPINS She gives a sharp nod and starts up the stairs)

Best foot forward Spit-spot

4A — Spit-Spot orchestra

(MICHAEL and JANE run up the stairs in front ofp MARY POPPINS as the relieved
WINIFRED watches MRS BRILL has joined her)

WINIFRED
Mrs Brill we have a new nanny

MRS BRILL
She passed her interview then

WINIFRED

Or I did
(WINIFRED and MRS BRILL exit)
MARY POPPINS - 13 -

SCENE 3 PRACTICALLY PERFECT - Nursery

(The nursery is an airy room light and full of optimism The CHILDREN rush in to
find that MARY POPPINS is already there)

MARY POPPINS
Very tidy I must say Tidier than I was expecting Who’s responsible for that

JANE
Mrs Bri—
MICHAEL
Me Iam I like to keep things neat

MARY POPPINS

Do you indeed Well I look forward to making use of that If there’s one thing I
appreciate it’s a child whose word I can depend on

(scoops up a boy doll)
Who’s he when he’s at home

JANE
That’s Valentine He’s mine
MARY POPPINS

From the look on his face I’m not sure he’d agree with you
JANE
He’s just a doll and I don’t want to play with him now

(JANE throws the doll into a box)

MARY POPPINS
Treat him like that and he might not want to play with you Now first things first
I always say the proper place to hang a hat is on a hat stand

4B— Magic Music 1 orchestra

(MARY POPPINS reaches in her bag and takes out a hat stand JANE and MICHAEL
look inside as they move the bag)

JANE
There’s nothing in it
MICHAEL
Wed better keep an eye on this one She’s tricky
- 14 — MARY POPPINS

JANE

Mary Poppins how could you know what we wanted in a nanny when we made
our list

MARY POPPINS
Your “list” I’m not an item in the weekly shop thank you very much

4C— Magic Music 2 orchestra

(MARY POPPINS takes another item perhaps a plant out of her bag and places it
strategically in the nursery)

JANE

How did you come then It was as if the wind just blew you here

MARY POPPINS
It did Now stand over there

5 —Practically Perfect Mary Poppins Jane Michael

(MARY POPPINS pulls a measuring tape from the bag holds it against MICHAEL
and reads the measure)

(MARY POPPINS)
Just as I thought “A noisy mischievous troublesome little boy”

MICHAEL

Youre making that up

(Without a word MARY POPPINS holds the tape for MICHAEL to read)
“A noisy mischievous troub—”

(Stunned MICHAEL looks at JANE)

MARY POPPINS

Now you

(holds the tape against JANE and reads)
“Thoughtless short-tempered and untidy”

JANE

I don’t believe you Let me see —
MARY POPPINS

SCENE 4 JOLLY HOLIDAY - Park

5A —All Me Own Work

(Park gates reveal the park beyond BERT paints the scene as he addresses the
audience)

BERT
CHIM CHIMINEY CHIM CHIMINEY CHIM CHIM CHER-OO
I DOES WHAT I LIKES AND I LIKES WHAT I DO
TODAY I’M A SCREEVER AND AS YOU CAN SEE
A SCREEVER’S AN ARTIST OF HIGHEST DEGREE
AND IT’S ALL ME OWN WORK
FROM MY OWN MEMORY

(A furious PARK KEEPER hurries towards BERT)

PARK KEEPER
Oh Lummy Not these again

BERT
Come on Mr Park Keeper It’s just me pictures like it always is There’s no ‘arm in

‘

em

PARK KEEPER

Ill be the judge o’ that This is my park and I say youre interfering with a public
railing I want ‘em removed this —

(The PARK KEEPER trails off as he becomes aware of MARY POPPINS who is with
the CHILDREN She looks firmly at him BERT continues to draw without lifting his
eyes)

That is— I er just you watch it That’s all just you watch it
(The PARK KEEPER walks off muttering BERT speaks still without raising his eyes)

BERT
Stay right where you are I’d know that silhouette anywhere Mary Poppins
MARY POPPINS
It’s nice to see you Bert

(BERT turns his eyes from his drawing and looks up)

BERT

Well I must say you do look swell

(MARY POPPINS snorts but as she pats her hair it is clear she agrees)
MARY POPPINS -

MICHAEL
How does he know you He can’t know you Youve only just arrived
MARY POPPINS

I wasn’t born one minute before I walked into your house Michael Banks Have you
met these two Bert

BERT
I’ve seen ‘em runnin’ about chasir a kite
MICHAEL
It isn’t a real kite
BERT
So what are you up to
JANE

Mary Poppins says it’s a game It’s called “A Walk in the Park”
MICHAEL

Some game
(kicks the pavement)

I’d rather eat spinach
MARY POPPINS

Come on Bert Youre due for a break and you promised youd take me out when
we met again Or have you forgotten

BERT
‘Course J aint Mary But

(BERT picks up his cap There’s only one coin in it)

MARY POPPINS

Oh dear is that all you’ve got Never mind My treat And no one’s charging for
the trees and the sky are they

JANE
Mary Poppins is he really coming with us

MARY POPPINS

Why shouldn’t he
JANE

Well to start with he’s very dirty isn’t he Father would never approve
BERT

Whats that
- 20 - MARY POPPINS

MICHAEL
(berates BERT)
You can’t come with us Youre too dirty And we don’t want to go to the stinky
park anyway
BERT
(gives it right back to MICHAEL)

Oh yes you do “Cause when you walk with Mary Poppins you go to places you
never dreamed of And if she says it’s a game she’s got something in mind You
can be certain of that

(BERT and the CHILDREN stand by his line of paintings)

JANE

imaginable the sky the richest blue the sun the brightest yellow A series of bizarre
events take place MARY POPPINS weaves among the PARK STROLLERS and the

6A—But How orchestra

(A rainstorm breaks The STATUES and TRANSFORMED CHARACTERS
disappear as the color drains from the scene The dazed CHILDREN are left standing
in front of NELEUS who is back on his plinth)

MICHAEL
Jane Did that really happen
JANE
Yes But how
NELEUS

Mary Poppins of course
(The CHILDREN gasp — then it wasn’t a dream)

MICHAEL
How do you know Mary Poppins
NELEUS
(approaches the CHILDREN)
She’s an old friend of my father
MICHAEL
Your father You’re a statue You can’t have a father
NELEUS
Well if that’s true why do I miss him so much

- MARY POPPINS

JANE
Isn’t he one of the other statues
NELEUS
(shakes his head sadly)
No He lives far away from here
JANE
Do you really miss him
NELEUS
Wouldn’t you miss your father if you hardly ever saw him
MICHAEL

Ill have to think about that
(The PARK KEEPER runs on followed by BERT and MARY POPPINS)
PARK KEEPER
Thats it Thats it That’s what it was

BERT

PARK KEEPER
This plinth is half empty The statue’s gone

(Quick as a flash BERT takes the PARK KEEPER’s arm and spins him around)

MARY POPPINS

Do you mean youve lost your marbles
(NELEUS vaults into place)

PARK KEEPER

This is your fault ain’t it I knew we should have trouble when you first arrived
Now weve got a statue missing

(sees NELEUS on his plinth and starts back with a cry)
What Oh Lummy
(The PARK KEEPER exits)

JANE

(Theres a big clap of thunder and it starts to pour The CHILDREN run through the
rain under MARY POPPINS’s umbrella towards No 17 As they reach the house the
figure of a small wizened woman the BIRD WOMAN passes them by)
JANE
Neleus must be so lonely Could his father ever come to stay

SCENE 5 LET’S HOPE SHE WILL STAY - Parlor

(WINIFRED is at the study door GEORGE is working at his desk The CHILDREN
and MARY take off their outdoor clothes)

WINIFRED
Jane and Michael want to say goodnight

GEORGE
Tell them youve given me the message
WINIFRED
George please

(GEORGE reluctantly comes out into the hall)

JANE
Oh Daddy Weve had a fantastic day We sang with a busker danced with a
statue and met Queen Victoria You wouldn’t have approved but—

GEORGE
If you know that then why did you do it
MICHAEL
Daddy could I have a kite A proper one
GEORGE
Could you fly it
MICHAEL
You could always teach me
GEORGE

When would J have the time to do that

(MICHAEL accepts this with a sad nod He’s used to it)

JANE
Daddy who was the father of Neleus

GEORGE
Would you please let me get on Goodnight
(As the children go out GEORGE returns to the study and takes up his pen with a
sigh)

WINIFRED

Poor Michael All he cares about is flying kites and his beloved astronomy of
course
MARY POPPINS -

GEORGE
I used to love astronomy at his age My nanny Miss Andrew soon beat it out of me
WINIFRED
I suppose we do need a nanny George It is out of the question to do without one

GEORGE
Don’t be absurd Of course we need a nanny All the best people have nannies So
the wives can do charity work and entertain Which reminds me how is your tea
party coming on
WINIFRED
I’m not sure It seems so odd to send out invitations to people I hardly know
GEORGE

But they’re people you should know Remember “By your friends shall ye be
judged”

WINIFRED

But that’s the point They’re not my friends Actually I heard today from Clemmie
Bunting She’s rehearsing a new play at the moment and I thought I might ask her —

GEORGE

How many times must I tell you I wish you to sever all connection with that part
of your life

WINIFRED
George I was an actress Lots of people might find that interesting though you
always talk as if I should be ashamed of it

GEORGE
Well it’s not exactly something to be proud of

(GEORGE has hurt WINIFRED’s feelings which was not his intention)

Winifred Dearest I’m only thinking of you I want people to admire you to
respect you

WINIFRED
I know George But sometimes it’s hard —
GEORGE
It is not hard It’s your job to be Mrs Banks
WINIFRED
And what is your job
GEORGE

To pay for everything
(GEORGE turns his attention to the desk again WINIFRED leans in startling him)
- 30 — MARY POPPINS

(GEORGE)
What is it
WINIFRED
I was only going to kiss you
GEORGE

Oh Oh All right

(GEORGE lifts his face for a rather unsatisfactory kiss Sadly WINIFRED starts for
the door)
Are you going to say something to Mary Poppins about this afternoon

WINIFRED
I don’t think so

GEORGE
Very well But just make sure she’s doing things our way and not hers

7—Let’s Hope She Will Stay George Winifred Jane Michael

(GEORGE)
WHAT GOOD ARE RULES IF YOU CAN BEND THEM
WE NEED A NANNY WHO IS DISCIPLINED AND STERN
WITH BOYS AND GIRLS YOU DON’T BEFRIEND THEM
I FEAR THAT MARY POPPINS HAS A LOT TO LEARN

(GEORGE turns back to his desk WINIFRED leaves the study and goes to the parlor
as she considers GEORGE’s remark)

WINIFRED
BEING MRS BANKS
SHOULD BE AN EASY ROLE
AND YET IT’S ONE WHICH I DON’T SEEM
TOO GOOD AT ON THE WHOLE
I HAVE A COMFY HOME
I HAVE A SIMPLE LIFE
I HAVE A NAME WHICH TELLS THE WORLD
I’M SOMEONE ELSES WIFE

BEING MRS BANKS
WHAT DOES THAT ENTAIL
FACING TESTS OF CHARACTER I ALWAYS SEEM TO FAIL
MARY POPPINS

(WINIFRED)

AND AS FOR HIS “BEST PEOPLE”
WELL ID LIKE TO SAY “NO THANKS”
THEY’RE NOT EXACTLY MY IDEA OF BEING MRS BANKS

(JANE and MICHAEL appear and look out a window)
JANE
I STILL FEEL AS IF I’M DREAMING

MICHAEL
SO MUCH FUN IN JUST ONE DAY

JANE MICHAEL

WHEN MARY HOLDS YOUR HAND YOU FEEL SO GRAND

YOUR HEART STARTS BEATING LIKE A BIG BRASS BAND

BERT

There’s some rough weather on every voyage Admiral

(BERT resumes his sweeping moving away from ADMIRAL BOOM and MISS

LARK)
ADMIRAL BOOM
(shaking his head)
Ah Miss Lark what those children need is a touch of the cat and a night on the
yardarm

MISS LARK
What those children need Admiral is a touch of happiness

(This is a novel idea for ADMIRAL BOOM as he watches MISS LARK walk on
clutching WILLOUGHBY who barks)

Willoughby

(In the kitchen a nervous WINIFRED is with MRS BRILL All around are signs of
preparations for the tea ROBERTSON AY watches)
MARY POPPINS

WINIFRED

Mrs Brill don’t make the sandwiches too early Theyll get stale before the guests

MRS BRILL

WINIFRED

MRS BRILL

WINIFRED
No

ROBERTSON AY
No

WINIFRED
Well Ill just go up and check the drawing room

(WINIFRED leaves MRS BRILL fuming ROBERTSON AY pipes up)
ROBERTSON AY

MRS BRILL

(JANE and MICHAEL come through the door)

JANE
Mother wants you in the drawing room
MRS BRILL
Well she can’t have me I’ve got enough on my plate as it is
JANE
She says you can tell Robertson Ay what to do
MRS BRILL

Does she indeed Well why don’t I go and have a smoke near the gasworks for
good measure

- MARY POPPINS

ROBERTSON AY
Please Mrs Brill I don’t mind honest
MRS BRILL

All right I will give you one task and one task only And so help me if you get this
wrong Ill swing for you and sing as they pull the lever

ROBERTSON AY
(filled with a sense of the task’s importance)
What is it Mrs Brill
MRS BRILL

Put the icing tools next to the cake and Ill need a bowl of hot water to warm them
I will make the icing as soon as I’m back

ROBERTSON AY
(simultaneously committing the tasks to memory)
Icing tools cake hot water I will make the icing as soon as I’m back
MRS BRILL

ROBERTSON AY

MRS BRILL

For you yes For me no Once the cake’s done I’ve the sandwiches next because
Madam wants them fresh So I can’t start them until there’s no time to finish them
I swear a slave in ancient Rome was on a pleasure cruise compared to my life in this
house

(MRS BRILL storms out and slams the door behind her)
JANE
Well don’t just stand there Robertson Ay

ROBERTSON AY

JANE

ROBERTSON AY

MARY POPPINS

JANE

MICHAEL
Because we don’t know how
JANE
Don’t be so feeble Get the eggs If Mrs Brill can do it it can’t be that hard
MICHAEL
Are there eggs in icing
JANE

There are in mine

(JANE starts to mix the sugar and water as MICHAEL finds the eggs ROBERTSON
AY carries the icing stuff to the table)

ROBERTSON AY
I don’t think Mrs Brill will thank you—
JANE
Then she will be guilty of great ingratitude
(MICHAEL and ROBERTSON AY look at Jane’s mix)
MICHAEL
Is it supposed to look like this

ROBERTSON AY
It doesn’t look like that when Mrs Brill does it

JANE

Don’t be impertinent and get me the cake

(ROBERTSON AY goes to the sink to fetch some water)

ROBERTSON AY
Honestly Miss Jane I was only trying to be helpful f you would—

(ROBERTSON AY burns his hand on the faucet and is thrown back by force
Ricocheting across the room he destroys the entire kitchen and ends up in an
unconscious heap)

JANE MICHAEL

NORTHBROOK

No We’re done and no man should be too busy for his own children
(to MICHAEL)

What are you here for young man Have you come for some money as well
GEORGE
Hardly What would they need money for
NORTHBROOK

Well it’s never too early to learn its value

(NORTHBROOK pulls two coins out and hands them to the children)

MICHAEL
I know the value of this sixpence
NORTHBROOK

No that’s its worth Its value’s in how you spend it Do good and may you have
good luck

MARY POPPINS
And what do you say to Mr Northbrook

JANE MICHAEL
Thank you

NORTHBROOK
Ill wait outside

(With a smile for the children NORTHBROOK exits)

GEORGE
What is the meaning of this Really Mary Poppins I am not without a sense of
humor—

MICHAEL
Arent you Daddy
MARY POPPINS - 45 -

GEORGE
No 1 am not But when I was a little boy I would never have dared interrupt my father
MICHAEL
Were you ever a little boy
GEORGE

Of course I was but my nanny Miss Andrew kept me out of my father’s way and
he’d have been very annoyed if she hadnt

JANE
What about your mother
GEORGE
I shouldn’t think I saw either of them more than once a week
JANE
Didn’t they mind
GEORGE
Mind They were glad to be rid of me
MICHAEL
Then who kissed you goodnight Miss Andrew
GEORGE

(this horrible image almost overpowering him)

Certainly not There was no time for hugs and kisses and all that soppy nonsense
(notices that the CHILDREN are aghast)

Whats the matter

MICHAEL
Poor Daddy

GEORGE
“Poor” What do you mean “poor” That’s what made me the man I am Eh Mary
Poppins

MARY POPPINS
Yes Im afraid it did

GEORGE

That’s enough Youve seen where I work and I have a great deal to do

MARY POPPINS

JANE
When you invest the bank’s money what are you looking for Daddy A good man
or a good idea

GEORGE
I suppose I should say it’s a good idea but a good man is much rarer and much

more valuable
MARY POPPINS

Come along children

(MARY POPPINS exits with JANE and MICHAEL)

GEORGE
Mr Von Hussler I’ve considered your arguments but I’m afraid my answer is no

VON HUSSLER
So you don’t recognize a good idea
GEORGE
Perhaps not but I recognize a good man when I see one

VON HUSSLER
You will regret this Herr Banks

(VON HUSSLER leaves in a huff GEORGE watches him go thinking aloud)

GEORGE
A MAN WITH DREAMS THAT LIFE HASN’T BROKEN
A MAN WITH HOPES AMBITIONS TO FULFILL
A MAN YOURE CERTAIN AT FIRST GLANCE
DESERVES A CHANCE

Now Mr Northbrook when exactly could the factory open

greeted by a surprised WINIFRED He puts down his briefcase as she helps him off

rivals They gave him the money and now its turned into a gold mine

WINIFRED

Michael
(MICHAEL has transferred the case to JANE He holds up both hands)
Jane
(JANE slides the briefcase back to her brother and holds up her hands But this time
GEORGE has seen the maneuver and shouts) ‘
Will you give it to me

(With a roar of fury he spins MICHAEL around and roughly snatches the case away
ALL are shocked by the violence and intensity of his anger He turns on WINIFRED)

Must I put up with this behavior Youre their mother Why can’t you do
something
WINIFRED
(attempting to take control of the situation)
Well I can try not shouting for a start

GEORGE

Mary Poppins You are here to teach the children manners and just look at them
They’re a pair of little savages If I had my way youd be out of this house by —

WINIFRED
George You’re tired

(GEORGE retires to the study dejected and closes the door)

Mary Poppins don’t bring the children down tonight Mr Banks is quite exhausted
Perhaps you could keep them occupied
MARY POPPINS
I hope you havent forgotten ma’am tonights my evening out
JANE

WINIFRED

Oh dear I had forgotten I suppose the best people wouldn’t ask you to change your
plans
MARY POPPINS

MARY POPPINS
No ma’am they wouldn’t
WINIFRED
I thought not
JANE

That’s not fair Daddy loses his temper and we’re shut up in the nursery Daddy’s
mean and rotten and I hate him

WINIFRED

Jane Take that back this instant I will not have you criticize your father
MICHAEL

Why not He criticizes you Last week he said you were neither use nor ornament
WINIFRED

How dare you—
MICHAEL

I heard him say it and so did you
(This one is below the belt WINIFRED answers with some dignity)

WINIFRED

Sometimes people say things they don’t mean Take the children upstairs please
Mary Poppins

(JANE and MICHAEL follow the nanny up WINIFRED goes to the study door She

hesitates then opens it and enters)

GEORGE
Don’t be ridiculous

MICHAEL

JANE

MARY POPPINS

Maybe but have you asked yourself who looks after the fathers when things go
wrong

MICHAEL
The mothers I suppose
MARY POPPINS
Not the children
JANE
Wouldnt that be rather upside-down

(MARY POPPINS continues to primp herself ready for her “evening out”)

MARY POPPINS

Sometimes families are upside-down for a while anyway

JANE
I don’t want to be in an upside-down family I wish I could run away

JANE
But youd miss me
MICHAEL

No I wouldn’t I could have your toys

GEORGE DEAR

MISS ANDREW
Good morning
GEORGE
The Holy Terror
(GEORGE runs out of the house)

WINIFRED
Miss Andrew It’s so lovely to meet you at last Ido hope you had a good journey

(The terrifying MISS ANDREW drops her bag and advances into the room with a
covered birdcage ROBERSTON AY struggles to move the surprisingly heavy bag to a
table)

MISS ANDREW

It was thoroughly unpleasant I never enjoy travel You must be poor Georges wife
Your flowerbeds are disgracefully untidy Take my advice plant evergreens Or
better still have nothing there at all just a plain cement courtyard

WINIFRED
But dear Miss Andrew I am so fond of flowers

MISS ANDREW
Then you are a very silly woman Where did George go

WINIFRED
He

(looks around)

Im afraid he had an urgent appointment
Mary Poppins - 75 —

MISS ANDREW

For which no doubt he was late as usual

(MISS ANDREW removes a poinsettia from a sideboard passes it to WINIFRED and
sets her birdcage down in its place WINIFRED passes the plant to MRS BRILL
MISS ANDREW looks about with a sneer)
It’s not much of a house is it
WINIFRED
We like it

MISS ANDREW

Then it doesn’t take a lot to keep you happy Look at the dust There And there
Filth

WINIFRED
Well we are rather short-staffed at the moment
MISS ANDREW
Hasn’t anyone ever cleaned those curtains
ROBERTSON AY
Ooh
MRS BRILL

MISS ANDREW
Ah You must be the children
(bends over to examine the CHILDREN then stands upright again)

Pity I don’t suppose you know who I am
MICHAEL

MISS ANDREW
Impudent boy

THESE CHILDREN HAVE BEEN SPOILED
IVE ARRIVED HERE JUST IN TIME
BY CHANCE I’VE BROUGHT THE PUNISHMENT

BRIMSTONE AND TREACLE AND COD-LIVER OIL

LIBERAL DOSES OF EACH

THESE ARE THE TREATS FROM WHICH CHILDREN RECOIL
THE LESSONS I’M GOING TO TEACH

JUST FOLLOW MY MODEL AND DON’T MOLLY-CODDLE
IT MAY LEAD THE IRKSOME TO IRK

SO SEEK SATISFACTION FROM PUNITIVE ACTION
BRIMSTONE AND TREACLE WILL WORK

Open

(MISS ANDREW has taken a terrifying-looking bottle and a large spoon out of her bag
At first the CHILDREN eye the medicine with curiosity perhaps it’s the same as Mary
Poppins’s magic medicine But MISS ANDREW pushes the spoon into the mouth of
JANE who gags with disgust and then she turns to MICHAEL)

MICHAEL
Does it taste as bad as it smells
MISS ANDREW
Worse
MICHAEL
Do I have to

(MICHAEL has appealed to the spellbound WINIFRED)

WINIFRED
Well I—
MISS ANDREW
Open

swallows and splutters in disgust)

WHERE MANNERS ARE CHRONIC MY TINCTURE’S THE TONIC
THAT’S CERTAIN TO WIPE OFF A SMIRK

JUST POUR OUT A RATION IN MATRONLY FASHION
BRIMSTONE AND TREACLE WILL WORK

Your son will go to boarding school at once As for the girl I shall take charge of her
myself

(This thought is too terrible for the CHILDREN even to contemplate)

I WON’T STAND FOR WHINING OR WHINGEING OR WHIMPERING
CRYING OR LYING OR SOBBING OR SIMPERING

I FEAR IT’S CLEAR THAT IN THESE TWO SUCH BAD HABITS LURK
FIRST THREATEN TO THROTTLE THEN UNCORK THE BOTTLE
BRIMSTONE AND TREACLE WILL WORK

(tosses bag to WINIFRED)
Now show me my room
BRIMSTONE AND TREACLE WILL WORK

(WINIFRED and MISS ANDREW go up the stairs to the nursery leaving the stunned
CHILDREN and SERVANTS)

MRS BRILL
She can’t stay Theyll have to dismiss her
(confidentially to ROBERTSON AY)

You know I never thought Id say this but I’m disappointed truly Iam I really
thought it was going to be yeah you know ‘er with the umbrella

(MRS BRILL and ROBERTSON AY exit The CHILDREN are completely still)

SCENE 2 LET’S GO FLY A KITE - Park

(At the park BERT works on a welcoming painting As he surveys the sky the
CHILDREN run straight into him Perhaps it’s the shock perhaps it’s because he’s
covered in soot but they don’t know him They scream)

BERT
Easy now your old friend ain’t going to hurt you
JANE
Oh Bert it’s you
MICHAEL
Youre filthy
BERT

P’raps a smudge or two It so ‘appens today I’m a chimney sweep So whats the

JANE
The nastiest nanny in the world

BERT

The nastiest nanny in the world eh Well you two should know Youve been
through enough of ‘em Is she really as bad as all that

MICHAEL
She looks like something that would eat its young
JANE
Miss Andrew was Daddy’s nanny
MICHAEL
Which explains a lot
JANE

Poor Daddy Ever since he stopped working he just sits and mopes Mary Poppins
used to say he needed our help but now it’s too late

16— Lets Go Fly a Kite Bert Park Keeper Jane Michael

Kite Flyers Mary Poppins

BERT
Oh I wouldn’t say that tell you what why don’t we start things off with a bit of a
shake for good luck

(BERT holds out his hand)
MARY POPPINS

JANE
Why would shaking hands with you bring us luck

BERT
Didn’t anyone ever tell you it’s lucky to shake a sweep’s hand

(JANE does so and so does MICHAEL)

MICHAEL
But what do you do if you want some luck
BERT

Oh well I shakes ‘ands with m’self Now what have we got here

(BERT searches in his capacious bag and extracts a large and beautiful red kite with
streamers)

JANE

(BERT holds the kite out to MICHAEL who is resistant)

Whats the matter Youve always wanted to fly a proper kite
MICHAEL
I’ve always wanted to fly one with Daddy
BERT
(crouches before MICHAEL speaking gently)

O’ course you have But you need to know how it’s done Get some training in and
youll make him the proudest father in the country

MICHAEL
Do you really think so Youre not just saying that

(Oh how MICHAEL wants to believe this)

BERT
Did I say the country The whole bloomin’ Empire more like

(The wind dies and the kite falls)
JANE

(BERT picks up the kite as MICHAEL winds the string)
BERT
Try again
(The PARK KEEPER hurries over)
PARK KEEPER
Whats this Whats this We don’t allow litter here

MICHAEL
It isn’t litter It’s a kite

(The PARK KEEPER looks up with a soft and foolish expression)

PARK KEEPER

Oh a kite is it My word it is I haven’t flown a kite since I was a boy
(grabs the string)

Now well wind her up give her a run and away shell go
MICHAEL
(also grabs the string)
I want to do it
PARK KEEPER
But youll let me help wont you Seeing as I havent flown a kite since I was a boy
MICHAEL
(relinquishes the string)
Oh all right

(The PARK KEEPER starts to run this way and that as the kite takes wing)
MARY POPPINS

BERT PARK KEEPER
WHEN YOU SEND IT FLYING UP THERE
ALL AT ONCE YOU’RE LIGHTER THAN AIR
YOU CAN DANCE ON THE BREEZE OVER ‘OUSES AND TREES
WITH YOUR FIST HOLDING TIGHT TO THE STRING OF YOUR KITE

BERT PARK KEEPER JANE MICHAEL KITE FLYERS
OH LET’S GO FLY A KITE

BERT

MICHAEL

JANE

PARK KEEPER

(But it’s no good The kite would seem to be stuck fast)

BERT
You can do it Pull one more time
MARY POPPINS
AH-AH-AH-AH-AH-AH
(Now the wind and the music reach a wild crescendo as slowly from high above the
familiar figure of MARY POPPINS comes into view)
KITE FLYERS

AH LET’S GO FLY A KITE
UP TO THE HIGHEST HEIGHT
OH LET’S GO FLY A KITE

- 82 — Mary POPPINS

(In one hand MARY POPPINS holds the kite in the other the carpet bag and the
parrot-handled umbrella She descends to the stage to the amazement of the
CHILDREN and the PARK KEEPER alike JANE runs forward)

JANE
I knew it Oh Mary Poppins I knew you’d come back
(The CHILDREN hug MARY POPPINS)
MARY POPPINS

Don’t squeeze I’m not a sardine in a tin

16A—A Sight For Sore Eyes orchestra

(MARY POPPINS)

And where are your coats
JANE

We didn’t have time to put them on

MARY POPPINS
And why not may J ask

MICHAEL

Because we’ve run away

MARY POPPINS

Have you indeed

(JANE’s response comes in a torrent an unstoppable flow of words that almost
overpowers the girl as it all pours out)

JANE
It’s been so awful since you went away and now Miss Andrew’s come and Daddy’s
ruined and we never helped him like you wanted us to and we were too stupid to
hear what you were saying —

MARY POPPINS
Oh my eye but your life’s a tragedy Now let’s go home And don’t dawdle

MICHAEL
But she’s there She came this morning As a surprise for Daddy

MARY POPPINS

(very firm)
Well maybe Ill be a surprise for her
MARY POPPINS

(MARY POPPINS)
(warmly)
That was a lovely greeting Bert
BERT
I meant it Mary welcome Youre a sight for sore eyes
JANE
You really are Welcome back Mary Poppins
BERT
(winks at MARY POPPINS)
I told you they were good kids Mary

MARY POPPINS
And I told you they were worth bothering with

(The PARK KEEPER has now recovered from his initial shock and for a brave moment
he tries to block MARY POPPINS’s way)

PARK KEEPER

Now see here It’s against the regulations Coming down from the sky like that
And where from Id like to know ei Where from

(MARY POPPINS stops and eyes the PARK KEEPER coldly)

MARY POPPINS
If were a Park Keeper I should straighten my cap and button my coat

(The PARK KEEPER is speechless)
Come along children
MICHAEL
Arent you going to shake hands with Bert for luck

MARY POPPINS
No

MICHAEL
Why not We have
MARY POPPINS
I don’t need any luck thank you

(MARY POPPINS exits with the children The PARK KEEPER reaches for the kite
but then backs off as BERT moves to pick it up With a wink BERT signals that the
PARK KEEPER can keep it What glee)
- 84 — MARY POPPINS

SCENE 3 GOOD FOR NOTHING - Park

(Evening falls and the scene changes to another part of the park with trees and a bench
Young KITE FLYERS run through the trees on their way home and BERT enters with
a lamplighter’s taper GEORGE wanders in alone and slumps wearily onto the bench)

17-Good For Nothing Being Mrs Banks George Winifred

GEORGE
ILLUSIONS MAY SHATTER BUT MEMORIES STAY
THE THINGS THAT REALLY MATTER I LOST ON THE WAY
THE SOVEREIGN THE MASTER AND LONG MAY HE REIGN
THE FAMOUS GOOD-FOR-NOTHING OF CHERRY TREE LANE

MARY POPPINS

SCENE 4 WINIFRED DESPAIRS - Park

(WINIFRED and the POLICEMAN enter the park She’s nearly out of her wits)

POLICEMAN

WINIFRED
But this time theyre not being naughty I’m afraid I’ve made them unhappy Im
afraid I’ve made everyone unhappy
POLICEMAN

(The POLICEMAN goes to look for Jane and Michael)

WINIFRED

(There is a harsh shout from above MISS ANDREW is issuing instructions to
ROBERTSON AY)

MISS ANDREW
(offstage)
Not like that you stupid boy

JANE

(A tiny sound partly a sigh and partly a whistle emanates from the covered cage)
Whats that noise
(MARY POPPINS strides over to the covered cage)

MARY POPPINS
Its a bird I might have known

(With a sudden flourish MARY POPPINS removes the cover to reveal the bird within
With a start of recognition Caruso opens his beak and gives a sad little cheep MARY
POPPINS answers him in song)

MICHAEL
What kind of bird is it
MARY POPPINS

A lark You are seeing a lark in a cage for the first time—and the last

(MARY POPPINS opens the door of the cage and carefully carries Caruso to the
window out of which he flies away then chirps back thanks)

My pleasure
(Another chirp)

Oh don’t mention it
MISS ANDREW
(from upstairs in a booming voice)

Tam going downstairs to fetch Caruso my lark
(appears and calls back to ROBERTSON AY)
You stay there and clean the grate again

(MARY POPPINS replaces the cover over the empty birdcage as MISS ANDREW
starts down the stairs and spies the CHILDREN MARY POPPINS is out of her
view)

WINIFRED

WINIFRED
How peculiar So Mary Poppins if youre back are you going to stay
MARY POPPINS

(This isn’t quite the response WINIFRED was hoping for)

WINIFRED

Because the last time you were here you left without a word of warning How do I
know you wont do it again

MARY POPPINS
You don’t
WINIFRED
Oh

MARY POPPINS

JANE
She might have thought we were rude
GEORGE
Rude To Miss Andrew Well I can’t forgive it but I’ll try to forget In fact—
(fumbles in his pockets with no result)

Id have given you sixpence if I had one

(This deflates GEORGE again WINIFRED intervenes)

WINIFRED
George you haven’t noticed Mary Poppins is back

GEORGE
Is she Mary Poppins Well well I wonder if I

- 94 - MARY POPPINS

(MARY POPPINS quickly and gracefully descends the stairs and crosses into the
study)
(GEORGE)

might have a word

(follows MARY POPPINS into the study shuts the door and clears his throat)
There’s no point in beating about the bush Things have not gone well for us since
you left us and—

MARY POPPINS
About my wages sir If you don’t mind I wont take any just now I should preter
to let them accrue

GEORGE

But Mary Poppins if you only knew how many payments are accruing as it is

(Before GEORGE says more MARY POPPINS nods and leaves the study
WINIFRED is waiting outside)

WINIFRED
Is everything settled

MARY POPPINS
It is Now I must get started Jane Michael spit-spot

Jane Michael Mary Poppins

(MARY POPPINS goes up stairs with JANE and MICHAEL She halts for a moment
sniffing the air)

Are the drains playing up or is Mrs Brill cooking

(MARY POPPINS continues her ascent Below WINIFRED looks at her GEORGE
She goes to comfort him stroking his hair He starts to speak but can’t)

WINIFRED

Come along darling You made a wrong decision but how bad is that After so
many years of good service Whats the worst that can happen

GEORGE
(thinks for a moment)

Winifred if 1am to be dismissed by the bank well be destitute The servants will
leave the house will be repossessed and well be outside with the children sitting on
the frosty curbside

(This is a blow to WINIFRED but after a second she recovers)
MARY POPPINS

WINIFRED
Well still have what really matters

(GEORGE looks at WINIFRED bewildered She smiles)
The children And each other
(Against GEORGE’s expectations WINIFRED has comforted him They exit together)

SCENE 9 A MAN HAS DREAMS - Parlor
(The sweeps have gone only BERT lingers unnoticed by the rest GEORGE has
opened the letter WINIFRED comes over He looks up)
GEORGE
It’s happened The Chairman wants to see me at the close of business tonight
WINIFRED

Tonight Well I’m going to come with you and jolly well give your Chairman a piece
of my mind

GEORGE

That would only make matters worse We might as well face it In just a few hours I
will have joined the ranks of the unemployed

WINIFRED
Oh George Are you quite sure
GEORGE

Quite sure So wed better make some plans In fact I’m afraid the time has come

(GEORGE looks up at his mother’s precious vase as MRS BRILL comes into the parlor
to tidy up)

WINIFRED
Do you mean your mother’s vase Wont you miss it terribly

GEORGE

Needs must my dear We always said we were saving it for a rainy day and
tomorrow it looks set to pour

(GEORGE climbs onto a chair and gingerly he picks up the vase)
WINIFRED
George - do be careful

(GEORGE starts to climb down again when MRS BRILL absentmindedly bangs into
the chair amid her cleaning The vase slips from George’s hands and shatters on the
floor MRS BRILL is aghast)

MRS BRILL
Ah The heirloom

(Pulling out a huge handkerchief MRS BRILL starts to blub uncontrollably This is
not helping the stunned GEORGE)

WINIFRED
Mrs Brill let’s go to the kitchen shall we Youd better sit down
MARY POPPINS - 107 -

(MARY POPPINS appears on the landing and sniffs the air)
MARY POPPINS
Mrs Brill is that the dinner cooking
MRS BRILL
(lifts her face from her handkerchief)
Don’t you start I’ve opened all the windows —
MARY POPPINS
I was only going to say that it smells delicious

(MARY POPPINS heads up the stairs)

MRS BRILL

The whole world has gone upside-down

(MRS BRILL exits with renewed anguish followed by WINIFRED)

2()-A Man Has Dreams (Reprise) A Spoonful of Sugar (Reprise)

George Bert

(GEORGE is alone when he sees a smattering of shining stars among the broken pieces
He bends down to pick them up)

GEORGE
Well I never So that’s where I put them
BERT
What are they
(To GEORGEs surprise BERT has emerged from the shadows)

GEORGE

Stars Gingerbread stars I hid once from my nanny always knew Id put them
somewhere no one would find them Trouble was I couldn’t find them either

BERT
They’re very bright
GEORGE
Aren’t they Even after all this time
BERT

Here let me give you a hand

(BERT helps to pick up the pieces of the vase)
108 —- MARY POPPINS

GEORGE
I used to dream that when I grew up Id learn everything there was to know about
the stars
(thoughtful pause)
Funny I havent thought about all that in years I’m not usually sentimental
BERT
S’good to look back sometimes

GEORGE

Is it I’m not so sure

A MAN HAS DREAMS OF WALKING WITH GIANTS
TO CARVE HIS NICHE IN THE EDIFICE OF TIME
BEFORE THE MORTAR OF HIS ZEAL

HAS THE CHANCE TO CONGEAL

The cup is dashed from his lips

The flame is snuffed aborning

He’s brought to rack and ruin in his prime
BERT

Life’s a rum go Guv’nor and that’s the truth

GEORGE

You know what I think It’s Mary Poppins From the moment she stepped into the
house things began to happen to me

MY WORLD WAS CALM WELL ORDERED EXEMPLARY
THEN CAME THIS PERSON WITH CHAOS IN HER WAKE
AND NOW MY LIFE’S AMBITIONS GO WITH ONE FELL BLOW
IT’S QUITE A BITTER PILL TO TAKE

It’s that Poppins woman She’s responsible for all this
BERT
I know the very person Whats that thing she’s always saying

A SPOONFUL OF SUGAR THAT IS ALL IT TAKES
IT CHANGES BREAD AND WATER INTO TEA AND CAKES
A SPOONFUL OF SUGAR GOES A LONG LONG WAY
SO ‘AVE YOURSELF AN ‘EALTHY ‘ELPING EVERY DAY
GEORGE
A healthy helping of trouble if you ask me

(GEORGE attempts to occupy himself with papers in his study)
MARY POPPINS -

BERT
Like you say Guv’nor

(placing the vase pieces carefully in the rubbish bin)

YOUVE GOT TO GRIND GRIND GRIND AT THAT GRINDSTONE
THOUGH CHILDHOOD SLIPS LIKE SAND THROUGH A SIEVE
AND ALL TOO SOON THEY’VE UP AND GROWN

AND THEN THEY’VE FLOWN AND IT’S TOO LATE FOR YOU TO GIVE

(The CHILDREN come out of the nursery and start downstairs MARY POPPINS
watches remains behind on the stairs GEORGE re-enters the parlor)

JUST THAT SPOONFUL OF SUGAR TO ‘ELP THE MEDICINE GO DOWN
THE MEDICINE GO DOWN MEDICINE GO DOWN

(holds out his hand to GEORGE)
Well good luck Guv’nor

(For a moment GEORGE is still and then deliberately he takes the sooty paw and
shakes it firmly)

GEORGE
Thank you Bert And good luck to you too

(BERT pauses in the hall only to turn and look up at MARY POPPINS She answers
his look with a nod and he leaves The CHILDREN approach their father cautiously
As they speak MARY POPPINS comes down silently carrying something)

JANE
Father
GEORGE
What is it
MICHAEL
Weve come to say goodnight
GEORGE

Ah Yes Goodnight
(But GEORGE is less severe than usual JANE approaches)

JANE
Daddy do you remember when we came to the bank

GEORGE
Yes
- 110 — MARY PopPPINS

JANE
Well we were each given a sixpence and were told to spend them carefully
GEORGE
Excellent advice That’s exactly what you should do What did you buy with them
JANE
Nothing yet We kept them And now weve decided to give them to you
GEORGE
I suppose Mary Poppins put you up to this

JANE
No She hasnt said a word about it but we know it’s been difficult for you lately
and we havent really been much help

MICHAEL
So we thought a bit of extra cash might loosen things up a little
JANE
It is a whole shilling
GEORGE
Thank you

(GEORGE cannot speak for fear of crying He nods briskly and takes the coins in
silence)

JANE
Goodnight Daddy We do love you you know

(JANE reaches up and kisses GEORGE)

GEORGE
Jane Do you remember you once asked me who Neleus’s father was
JANE
Yes
GEORGE

It was Poseidon King of the Sea Goodnight

20A — King of the Sea orchestra

(The CHILDREN head up to the nursery passing MARY POPPINS GEORGE goes
into his study MARY POPPINS swiftly places the object Michael’s broken makeshift
kite —on the floor of the hall then sails upstairs GEORGE emerges from his study and
sees the kite Thoughtfully he picks it up)

JANE
Mummy Daddy’s really worried isn’t he

WINIFRED

Yes he is But always remember that he loves you very much And that’s far more
important than jobs or houses or anything else

MICHAEL
Are you going to the bank with him
WINIFRED

I wish he’d let me But he wont If only there was someone to speak up for him To
take his part To show them what he’s really like inside

JANE

Why can’t he do that for himself

WINIFRED
Because he’s a man And a very proud one

MICHAEL
Then you must go

WINIFRED
Id like to go but I’m afraid it just isn’t possible

MICHAEL
Why

WINIFRED

(smiles)

Because I’m a woman

(Theres a pause MARY POPPINS enters)

CHAIRMAN

Well Banks how did it happen You turned down a scheme that was bound to
make millions and we want to know why

(The assembled BANKERS wait Firmly GEORGE starts to speak)

GEORGE
Then Ill tell you I refused Mr Von Hussler because his scheme was hollow It had
no product it had no substance it had no meaning outside the walls of a bank Oh
yes he told me about assets and profits and growth but there wasn’t a word about
people I know that if a man puts any value on real life then as far as you’re
concerned he’s a wash-out but I’m afraid I do value it gentlemen In short George
Banks Esquire has rediscovered the human race I apologize for ruining the bank
But I do not apologize for understanding that there are more important things in life
than making money

(The silence that greets this is not one of indignation but rather of bewilderment
At last the CHAIRMAN speaks)

CHAIRMAN

Ruining the bank Ruining the bank Ruining the bank My dear chap what are
you talking about Youve saved our bacon Havent you heard Von Hussler’s
scheme has ruined our rival Youve kept us out of the nastiest scandal since records
began We don’t want your apologies Were offering ours

negotiated we look set to make a fortune
