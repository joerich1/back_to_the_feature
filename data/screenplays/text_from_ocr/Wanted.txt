EXT WESLEY’S NEIGHBORHOOD CHICAGO - DAY

A seedy part of town where the APARTMENT BUILDINGS are built
just feet from the ELEVATED TRACKS of the ‘L’ TRAIN One of
which rumbles by every few minutes Like NOW

INT WESLEY’S APARTMENT -

-After the TRAIN passes we find ourselves listening to
noises A RHYTHMIC CREAKING GRUNTS AND GROANS

BARRY and CATHY are having sex on the kitchen table

If sex can be beautiful this is NOT that Everything about
the image - from the CHEAP DANGLY BRACELETS on her arms to

the SWEAT STAIN on the back his POLYESTER DRESS SHIRT to the
sound the PLASTIC TABLECLOTH MAKES - is borderline repulsive

WESLEY (VO)
This is my best friend having sex with
my girlfriend on top of a table I got
on Ebay for a very reasonable price

INT SUPERMARKET - DELI COUNTER - DAY

WESLEY GIBSON stands in line with Barry getting ready to
order They’re laughing at one of Barry’s jokes

WESLEY (VO)
Here I am grabbing lunch with hima
few days later and pretending not to
know about it

DELI CLERK 1
Who’s next

Wesley is But some GUY who has just walked up jumps in
first

GUY

Wesley looks at Barry who is distracted by some GIRL and
thus didn’t notice this snub

WESLEY (VO)
I tell myself the guy probably thought

The Guy glances at Wesley No he didn’t
DELI CLERK 2

Barry pats him firmly on the shoulder

BARRY

WESLEY (VO)
I am I’m the man

INT SUPERMARKET - PHARMACY AREA - A LITTLE LATER
Wesley watches the PHARMACIST look through the orders

WESLEY (VO)
Never mind the fact I’m on my doctor’s
tenth

PHARMACIST
You said there were two

WESLEY (VO)
And eleventh attempt to quell my
occasional runaway heart-rate If
they really were the panic attacks he
thinks they are one of his wonder
pills would have worked by now

The Pharmacist comes back with one bottle and one form

PHARMACIST
We don’t have the Luvox You’1ll have
to come back Monday

Wesley collects his bottle of “Ativan” and signs the form
FRED FLINTSTONE He SMIRKS when the Pharmacist doesn’t
bother to look TURNS to see Barry PERUSING THE CONDOMS

WESLEY (VO)
Besides in order to have a panic
attack first you have to care

EXT WESLEY’S NEIGHBORHOOD - MORNING

Wesley walking to the ‘L’ stop in his business attire
ignoring the THREE CHOLOS who hassle him

WESLEY (VO)
About how every couple of days you’re
harassed by semi-literate fucks

INT WESLEY’S APARTMENT - NIGHT
Wesley lying awake as Cathy snores

WESLEY (VO)
About all the blow-jobs you’re not
getting

INT WESLEY’S CUBICLE - LARGE ACCOUNTING FIRM - DAY

Wesley in the middle of being lectured by his boss JANICE
Her voice is a FAINT MURMUR right now but she looks angry

WESLEY (VO)
About the fact you’re publicly flogged
by your boss every time her boss chews
her fat ass out
(calm)
But I don’t

JANICE’S VOICE snaps in at FULL VOLUME--

JANICE
Hell why not just take a dump in your
hands fork it over and say “this is
the best I’m gonna give you Janice”

He glances down at his hand -- STEADY as a rock It pulls
him and us back into the world where her voice is FAINT

WESLEY (VO)
See Like magic

JANICE (FAINT)
This is America We live for our
jobs Die for our jobs But not you

BANG A noise distracts Wesley and interrupts his state of
reverie It’s a BUILDING MAINTENANCE WORKER putting up
plywood in the corner office using a STAPLE GUN

WESLEY (VO)
In fact about the only things that do
seem to bother me
22307 4

BANG Wesley grows more irritated A new NOISE creeps in
It’s Wesley’s HEARTBEAT And it’s beginning to speed up

WESLEY (VO)
Are crude noises Like when some
asshole

JANICE (FAINT)
Hell Rochelle is a better accountant
than you

BANG Wesley’s heartbeat is flying now

WESLEY (VO)
Plays Rambo with his staple gun

JANICE (FAINT)
And she’s autistic

BANG SUDDENLY EVERYTHING AROUND WESLEY IS IN SLOW MOTION

This is one of his ‘ATTACKS’ A CO-WORKER moves like a
glacier The STAPLE GUN fires as if it were in molasses
The WALL CLOCK ticks one second for every five Wesley feels

AND JUST LIKE THAT -- IT’S OVER Life is back at FULL-SPEED

JANICE (0S)
Do you want to lose this job

Wesley taking a beat The maintenance guy is done The
world looks normal And Janice is waiting for an answer

JANICE
Wesley Do you want to lose this job

WESLEY
No I don’t Janice You’re
completely right I’m very sorry

Satisfied with Wesley’s contrition Janice walks off past
Wesley’s CO-WORKERS including Barry who’ve seen the ass-
chewing Wesley reaches for the ATIVAN He sighs
EXHAUSTED Even his VOICE has lost it’s edge

WESLEY (VO)
My name is Wesley Gibson My mother
died last spring My father walked
out on us when I was nine days old
Did he look into my baby-blues and
realize he’d just fathered one of the
most insignificant assholes of the
21st century

EXT A WOODED AREA - OUTSIDE CHICAGO - DAY

Peace and tranquility A small pond with ducks

A HUNTER sets up in a duck blind He assembles a tripod
(odd) sets a SNIPER RIFLE on it (very odd) and aims His
wristwatch ALARM scatters the ducks sends them SKYWARD
SNIPERSCOPE POV

A big Mallard flies into view blocking for an instant the
SKYSCRAPERS in the distance

THE HUNTER

Fires We hear the WHINE of the bullet as it slices through
the air But it MISSES the duck

EXT DOWNTOWN CITY STREET - SAME TIME

A man (MR X) climbs up from an underground ‘L’ station We
see him ONLY from behind He’s well-dressed and lean

He walks towards A SKYSCRAPER Our view of him BLOCKED by a
lightpole then a hotdog vendor then people in the crowd

INT ELEVATOR - MOMENTS LATER
Mr Xs finger presses the ‘53’ button
INT 53RD FLOOR - CORRIDOR

FOLLOW MR X as he makes his way through DOOR AFTER DOOR
towards an OFFICE at the end of the hall

It’s marked ‘Puja Textiles -- ImportExport’

INT PUJA’S OFFICE - DAY

PUJA an Indian woman dressed in a sari with a red bindi on
her forehead sits behind a desk talking on the PHONE
There are TEXTILE SAMPLES on display all around the room
Her DOOR OPENS and when she realizes who it is SHE HANGS UP
without a word Mr X skirts the floor-to-ceiling windows

and stands in the only shadowy protected spot in the room

MR X
Well

Puja slides a FOLDER across the desk
22307 6

MR X
What about electronic records DMV
bills--

PUJA

Altered or deleted as Sloan requested
If anyone looks for him they’1l find
a disc jockey in Wisconsin

Mr X (still unseen) collects the FOLDER He looks up at
Puja and sees HER RED BINDI start to MOVE There’s a SECOND
DOT on her forehead now

MR X
GET DOWN --

--A SNIPER’S BULLET pierces the window RIPPING into her
third eye VAPORIZING everything above her eyebrows

INTERCUT HALLWAY - SAME TIME

MR X races away from her office SHOVING people out of his
way as barrels down the corridor

He REACHES the elevator and press the button -- DING -- the
door opens He walks inside and turns BACK AROUND

He’s not fleeing He’s creating as long a runway for himself
as possible

MR X breaks into a full sprint racing for Puja’s Office
His velocity whips up office papers as he thunders by like a
locomotive

INT PUJA’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Mr X LEAPS ONTO PUJA’S DESK using it as a ramp with such
force that it BREAKS as he PUSHES OFF of it

EXT OUTSIDE THE SKYSCRAPER - FIFTY FLOORS UP - DAY

The city skyline is REFLECTED in the mirrored glass of Puja’s
office Only the tiny hole from the sniper’s bullet let’s us
know were even looking at a WINDOW But then--

SMASH

Mr X comes flying out of it Glass shards covering his body
as he HURTLES 500 feet above the city and draws a PAIR OF
HI-TECH GUNS

ANGLE OVER HIS SHOULDER as he fires both guns sending DUAL
ROUNDS seemingly harmlessly AWAY from the building
22307 7

But on his FOLLOW-THROUGH gun draw he TWISTS HIS WRISTS
INWARD like a baseball pitcher throwing a curveball

AND NOW WE REALIZE THE BULLETS ARE CURVING BACK AROUND LIKE
TWO HEAT-SEEKING MISSILES

EXT SKYSCRAPER ACROSS THE STREET

Thup thup -- His shots punch two neat little bindi dots in
the foreheads of TWO MARKSMEN hiding on the roof from where
they just killed Puja They die identically as she did
REVERSE ANGLE of another MARKSMAN seeing X coming

MARKSMAN 1
-oh shit

The man gathers his courage and returns fire as--
MR X - SAILING THROUGH SPACE

nears the roof -- but the angle is wrong xX falls short He
yells as he tumbles OUT OF VIEW

The surviving MARKSMEN -- five in all -- can’t believe their
luck They run to the ledge but when they peek over

There is no red splat on the ground Then they notice bits
of glass falling from a BROKEN WINDOW one floor below

MARKSMAN 1
Fu--

Thup -- a perfect little hole PUNCHES through 1’s forehead
As he falls over the edge we BOOM UP TO REVEAL MR X --
standing behind the remaining four Marksmen -- guns in fists

Thup Thup Two more bloody bindis

Next in line MARKSMAN 2 drops his gun and covers his
forehead with his hands So Mr X shoots him in the nuts
and when 2 drops his hands to clutch his crotch thup
Finishes 2 with that same head shot

The LAST MARKSMAN cowers behind a duct xX KNOCKS him to the
ground then towers over him aiming at his forehead

And for the first time Mr X is REVEALED Six feet of
chiseled feral muscle An angel of death come to fight

MR X
Never send sheep to kill a wolf
22307 8

LAST MARKSMAN
(mumbling looking down)
We’re just the decoys man Just the
motherfucking decoys

MR X stops at those words What He looks DOWN to see he
is standing on A CHALK MARK A WHITE CROSS Oh shit

SFX A DISTINCTIVE WHINE COMING IN FAST

MR X looks up just as -- SHWWWAKK -- a GEYSER OF BLOOD AND
BRAINS SPLATTERS CAMERA AND WE FREEZE FRAME

DOLLY AROUND through the frozen moment through a cloud of a
thousand paused blood droplets We see a HUMONGOUS HOLE IN
XS HEAD His body stands there not realizing it’s dead
TILT DOWN to see the marksman cringing away from the

gigantic rifle round -- which trails a tail of gore behind it
-- and is frozen an inch from his face

Then the scene begins to play INREVERSE We FOLLOW THE
RIFLE ROUND BACK THROUGH THE HOLE IN MRX’s HEAD AND

EXT CHICAGO - BULLET FLIGHT -

Then back OVER the city mile after mile in the blink of an
eye Until it reaches a familiar area of woods miles away

EXT WOODED AREA - OUTSIDE CHICAGO - DAY

Where the bullet passes BACKWARDS by that DUCK also flying
BACKWARDS and then arcs down INTO barrel of the

HUNTER’S RIFLE

Apparently the Mallard wasn’t the target after all And as
we look into the HUNTER’S EYE we hear a woman’s voice

FOX (VO)
It was Cross

EXT SKYSCRAPER - A LITTLE LATER

Three NEW FIGURES stand at the scene of Mr X’s death Two
men ANTON and KANG One woman FOX Fox crouches
indicates a bit of CHALK the wind hasn’t blown away yet

FOX
Sloan is right Cross is hunting us

Anton steps on the dead marksmen with no regard
22307 9

KANG
Where the hell did he fire from

ANTON
It’s Cross He could have fired from
the moon Point is he didn’t miss

Fox is collecting the contents of the FOLDER

FOX
Actually the point is he killed xX
but didn’t come for the folder Which
means he didn’t need it Which means
he already knows

Kang and Anton’s faces fall
INT WESLEY’S CUBICLE - SAME TIME
Wesley is asleep at his desk

WESLEY (VO)
If I look tired it’s because I had my
usual 7 AM wake-up call

INT WESLEY’S APARTMENT - MORNING

MUSIC wakes him It’s a GREEK FOLK BALLAD playing in one of
his unseen neighbor’s apartments across the tracks

WESLEY

(groggy )
Every morning The same fucking song

WESLEY (VO)
Which would have been fine if I hadn’t
been up all night with Cathy

INT WESLEY’S APARTMENT - NIGHT BEFORE
Cathy is sobbing Wesley unsure what to do

WESLEY (VO)
Consoling her after she broke down and
confessed to fucking no less than
twenty-two different guys in the
eleven months we’ve been together

Cathy looks up at him

CATHY
I want us to try for a baby I think
if you made that kind of commitment to
(MORE )
22307 10
CATHY (CONTD)
me I wouldn’t need the validation of
these constant affairs
Wesley stares at her utterly terrified
RESUME INT WESLEY’S CUBICLE
Wesley JERKS up Awakened And still sort of terrified He
RESUMES working on the spreadsheet open on his computer as
Janice walks by SHAKING her head at him
WESLEY (VO)
One in ten people have an abusive
boss

Barry PATS him on the shoulder as he walks by

BARRY
Who’s the man

WESLEY (VO)
One in five have a cheating partner

EXT SUPERMARKET - ATM - NIGHT
Wesley hits the “Quick Cash” button A message comes up on
the screen “Insufficient Funds Balance 1467 Would
you like another transaction”
WESLEY (VO)

I was supposed to be a millionaire by

twenty four
Wesley clicks “Yes” and tries to withdraw 10 from checking
The machine BLEATS “Withdrawals must be made in increments
of 20 Would you like another transaction”

Wesley yanks his card out in frustration

WESLEY (VO)
Instead I’m fighting with the ATM

INT SUPERMARKET - AISLE
Wesley picks up the cheapest pasta he can find

WESLEY (VO)
Eating like a college freshman

INT SUPERMARKET - PHARMACY

Wesley slides that second prescription into the tray
22307 11

WESLEY (VO)
And popping more pills than an
octogenarian--

A HAND snatches the prescription from the tray and CRUMBLES
it up WESLEY looks from the HAND up the ARM and sees FOX

FOX
You don’t need that anymore

WESLEY
Excuse me

Her DEMEANOR is all-business She doesn’t want to ALARM
Wesley but like a soldier she knows every second counts

FOX
You don’t need it Wesley Never did

WESLEY
Do I know you

FOX
I think you’d remember Now I want
you to listen to me very carefully--

WESLEY
I’m going to have to ask for my
prescription back

No time to dawdle Fox draws her GUN

FOX
Make sure you say “please”

Wesley raises his hands terrified Fox is annoyed

FOX
I’m not robbing you I’m your ride
You’re in danger--

WESLEY
Is this some kind of joke--

FOX
(re his basket of groceries)
No a joke is you cooking for that
twenty-two timing girlfriend of yours
So be a good boy and come with me

-But then CROSS rounds the corner behind them onto their
aisle a full-auto 50 cal in each hand
22307 12

Caught in the middle Wesley’s eyes go wide as FOX starts
firing RIGHT PAST HIS HEAD -- BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM --
forcing Cross to take cover on the far side of the aisle
She then SHOVES Wesley out of harm’s way

FOX
MOVE

Wesley tumbles aside just as CROSS comes back up firing a
killing machine Wesley’s heart kicks into hyperdrive

WESLEY’S POV

As the world SLOWS It’s another one of his ‘attacks’

The pasta aisle EXPLODES IN A SLOW-MOTION AVALANCHE OF
BULLETS AND DRY NOODLES as Fox and Cross shoot it out
Panicking Wesley runs through the surreal slow-mo warzone
On opposite sides of the aisle a BOX OF CEREAL and a JUG OF
MILK detonate simultaneously and Wesley ducks the debris
trails of both as they meet and SWIRL deliciously in mid-air
RESUME -- FULL SPEED -- FOX

Blasts away from the BEVERAGE AISLE moving with great
agility but clearly WORKING HARD -- giving it her all

CROSS

Looks formidable by comparison He moves like Barishnikov --
steady calm Utterly fearless

FOX

Tries to keep an eye on the fleeing Wesley as she continues
to fire With impressive dexterity she manages to sidestep
AROUND and OVER the fountains of exploding beverages all
around her

AVOIDING all the cascading liquid

--except for when a bottle of HEINEKEN gets hit and she
takes a QUICK SIP

--before seeing WESLEY escape out the front of the store

FOX
Idiot
22307 13

EXT MARKET - CONTINUOUS

Wesley bursts outside His heart RACING Sweat POURING down
his face He runs across the PARKING LOT

BEHIND HIM Cross exits the store and hurls some Yuppie out
of his Range Rover Cross doesn’t have far to go to get

WESLEY who looks back over his shoulder to see the oncoming
Range Rover when

FOX
Wesley

FOX screeches to a STOP directly in front of Wesley whose
momentum Fox knows will cause him to SMACK right into the
side of her car and FLIP heels over head into the
PASSENGERS SEAT

FOX
(deadpan )
Get in

Fox BURNS FORWARD OUT OF THE WAY just as THE RANGE ROVER
THUNDERS PAST missing them by an inch and SMASHING A
SHOPPING CART RIGHT AT CAMERA
EXT CITY STREETS -
FOX expertly weaves in and around traffic on a major avenue
INT SIROCCO - SAME
Fox SEES the demon Rover quickly gaining on them in her rear-

view mirror A SIGN ahead indicates they are coming up to
the FREEWAY

WESLEY

What the hell is going on
FOX

Do me a favor -- shut-up

Wesley looks behind them Even from this far away he can
hear Cross STOMP the gas -- BRRRR-R-R-OOOOM

WESLEY
Who is that

FOX
You don’t want to know
22307 14

WESLEY
Yes I do want to know

FOX
His name is Cross and he’s probably
the single most lethal person alive

WESLEY
(beat)
I could’ve done without knowing that

BOOM BOOM 50 caliber slugs SHATTER the REAR WINDSHIELD
The back of the Sirocco is riddled with holes

FOX
Come on Come on

She means the FREEWAY ON-RAMP which is just ahead now ONLY
before they can reach it

--There is suddenly an opening in traffic which means Cross
can get a CLEAR SHOT on the VW

BOOM BOOM Rounds pummel the car One bullet passes over
Foxs shoulder and BLOWS OUT the WINDSHIELD

FOX
HANG ON-

With a SCREECH of tires Fox SWERVES aggressively and heads
up the FREEWAY RAMP

The OFF-RAMP Fox has CHOSEN to GO THE WRONG WAY
EXT FREEWAY RAMP - THE RANGE ROVER

Almost doesn’t make the turn It goes up precariously on two-
wheels before Cross gets it back under control and continues
his pursuit

INT SIROCCO - CONTINUOUS

Oncoming TRAFFIC streaks by at the speed of light FOX
zigzags through the meteor shower of headlights and blaring
horns

In the SIDE VIEW MIRROR she can see Cross staying with them
Worse he’s benefitting from the path they cut in the
oncoming assault of vehicles Fox KNOWS she needs to think
of something -- FAST

WESLEY
Why is he doing this
22307 15

FOX
He wants to kill you before you kill
him

WESLEY

I’M A ACCOUNTANT

FOX SWERVES into the emergency lane to give them a break in
the traffic

FOX
Yeah But until earlier this morning
Cross wasn’t the most lethal man in
the world

She DRAWS HER GUNS and -- -- BLAM BLAM -- blasts the
Sirocco’s tempered glass roof into a BILLION BITS

FOX (CONT’D)
Your father was
(off Wesley’s stunned
look)
Take the wheel

She STANDS up and begins FIRING backwards at Cross as Wesley
gawks safety glass tinkling down around him

WESLEY
But -

His protests are cut off as Fox UNLOADS at the Rover BLAM-
BLAM-BLAM-BLAM No choice Wesley slides behind the wheel

WESLEY’S POV

They are angling back into oncoming traffic He has to dodge
cars that are closing in at a rate of more than 100 MPH

FOX

continues to fire BLAM-BLAM-BLAM-BLAM-BLAM The Rover’s
hood headlights radiator perforate like Swiss cheese
But the monster SUV won’t die Surges closer

EXT FREEWAY - WIDE - NIGHT

As CAMERA moves up away from Fox and TILTS UP to give us
the VIEW OF WHAT’S AHEAD

There’s an ACCIDENT All the lanes are blocked And there’s
a TOW TRUCK starting a U-TURN
22307 16

INT SIROCCO -

Fox FINISHES OFF her first two guns The instant they are
out of ammunition she TOSSES them like daggers

-They SMASH into the Range Rover’s windshield
And she draws her two back-up weapons to continue firing
FOX

I’m running out of guns You have to

lose him
But Wesley has his own concern The headlights are suddenly
GONE And though he’s grateful for the break he can see
the ACCIDENT ahead The entire freeway is a WALL

WESLEY
Oh shit

One of Fox’s last two guns RUNS out of bullets

FOX
You can do this Wesley

Wesley sees there is NOWHERE to go He panics

FOX
Wesley

Wesley is frozen in fear A wall of cars ahead

FOX
WESLEY

The LAST BULLET chambers itself in Fox’s gun -- and with it
SHE FIRES DOWN shooting a bullet BETWEEN Wesley’s legs

WESLEY’S POV

Foxs trick did it Now he sees the world in SLOW-MOTION

And he spies that TOW TRUCK moving into the emergency lane --
with its ramp coming down

INT SIROCCO
Wesley JERKS the wheel ANGLING for the TOW TRUCK
Fox dives back in her seat as

THEY hit the Tow Truck’s ramp at FULL SPEED
22307 17

EXT FREEWAY
The Sirocco VAULTS INTO THE AIR

Sailing OVER THE DIVIDER -- on a collision course with the
side of

A CITY BUS cruising in the carpool lane
SLOW MOTION INSERT - THE BUS DRIVER’S SIDEVIEW MIRROR

The Sirocco FLIES through the air towards the bus ROTATING
on its axis 90 degrees

In the little bubble mirror we can see the BUS DRIVER’S
expression of horror as the flying car gets NEARER AND --

BACK TO SHOT
--Slams WHEELS FIRST onto the side of the BUS

The force of the impact KNOCKS the bus on its side
effectively RIGHTING the Sirocco

Which then HOPS OFF and continues down the road UNSCATHED as
THE BUS scrapes and spins to a stop BLOCKING the road

EXT ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE FREEWAY
Cross SWERVES to stop -- has to abandon the chase
EXT FREEWAY OFF-RAMP - MOMENTS LATER

The SIROCCO comes barreling down the ramp like a runaway
train Its brakes fully locked - smoking as they bite

The car comes to a PERFECT STOP at a traffic light Wesley

is breathless shaking -- looks like death warmed over
FOX
Nice job
WESLEY

Thanks now if youll excuse me I am
getting the fuck out of this car--

POW -- FOX knocks him out with the butt of her gun

TO BLACK
22307 18

INT FRATERNITY - REPAIR SHOP ROOM

Close on WESLEY lying unconscious on a large work table
DRIP DRIP A few drops of Vodka land on Wesley’s eyes

WESLEY’S POV

His eyes open Adjust to an image in front of him It’s
furry and brown AND BLOODY

WESLEY

jerks up at the sight of a DEAD RAT with a PAIR OF FLIES
buzzing around it FOX AND ANTON stand there watching him
Anton screws the cap back on his SILVER FLASK of VODKA

SLOAN (0S)
It’s okay Wesley

SLOAN walks out from the shadows

SLOAN
You’re in no danger here I apologize
for meeting like this but events have
unfolded rather quickly I’m having
your father’s assets transferred to
your account they are substantial--

WESLEY
Who are you How the hell do you all
know who I am--

SLOAN
My name is Sloan Our resident rat-
catcher here is Anton And given
she’s not much for talking allow me
to introduce your rescuer Fox

WESLEY
Rescue

FOX
I told him about Cross and his father
(droll)
I don’t think he believed me

Sloan calculates exactly what he’s going to say and do next
He begins by reaching into his POCKET for something

SLOAN
Wesley we know who you are because we
worked with your father You’re here
because the man who killed him
22307 19

--it’s a CLIP He loads it into a black IMANISHI HANDGUN

SLOAN (CONTD)
--The man who then tried to kill you
thinks you are capable of stopping him
-- and I think he’s right

Snap The clip locks into place

SLOAN (CONTD)
Unfortunately you won’t believe me
any more than you did Fox so

Sloan raises the GUN

WESLEY
Jesus Christ

Sloan SLIDES the gun across the table to Wesley

SLOAN
Shoot the wings off those flies

Meaning the TWO FLIES buzzing around the rat

WESLEY
Wh--what

Sloan GLANCES at Fox In a BLUR she DRAWS HER OWN GUN and
puts it right at WESLEY’S TEMPLE Wesley is TERRIFIED

FOX
On three Either you shoot or I do

She COCKS her gun and when she does the WORLD SLOWS DOWN for
Wesley He’s having one of his ‘ATTACKS’

SLOAN
What you’re feeling is your heart
pumping in excess of 400 beats a
minute Sending copious amounts of
Adrenaline through your bloodstream

FOX
One

Wesley terrified AIMS at the FLIES which are now BARELY
moving at all

SLOAN
It’s triggered by noises and
situations your mind perceives as a
(MORE )
22307 20

SLOAN (CONTD)
threat The sound of an explosion
The feel of a gun to your head

FOX
Two

Wesley squints He can see each beat of the flies’ wings

SLOAN
It allows you to react hundreds of
times faster than normal It improves
your senses Makes your coordination
as sharp as a razor blade

FOX
Three--

BANG BANG BANG BANG
And we’re BACK TO NORMAL TIME Wesley has fired four times

FOX SLOAN and ANTON look to see how he did When they turn
back WESLEY is POINTING THE GUN AT THEM

WESLEY
Just stay where you are

ANTON
Are you totally mental Cross will
spray your brains all over the
sidewalk--

SLOAN
It’s alright Anton
(to Wesley paternally)
Those aren’t panic attacks son It’s
a rare genetic gift you inherited from
your father Every “Weaver” has it

Wesley ANGLES for the door

WESLEY
Don’t follow me

SLOAN
It’s why Cross fears you He knows
with proper training you would be
literally unstoppable

WESLEY
I mean it
22307 21

SLOAN
After all how many accountants do you
know that can do that

Wesley glances and can’t believe his eyes The TWO FLIES ARE
ALIVE BUT WINGLESS buzzing angrily on the table

For a moment Wesley hesitates Then common sense returns
and he BACKS out the door still aiming at them

FOX
(to Wesley)
Six weeks with me -- you’ll have the
balls to pull that trigger
Then he’s GONE Fox and Anton look at Sloan

FOX
I’1l stop him--

SLOAN
Let him go Give it time to sink in

INT FRATERNITY - MAIN TEXTILE FLOOR - CONTINUOUS

Wesley is SHOCKED and DISORIENTED to find himself on the
DARKENED FLOOR of a massive TEXTILE PLANT There are dozens
of massive LOOMS fed by TALL TOWERS of thread all currently
off like sleeping dinosaurs

Wesley races for the door

EXT FRATERNITY - NIGHT

He comes out into a COURTYARD that features an odd collection
of GARMENT VANS mixed with the occasional SHOT-UP VEHICLE
One massive man (THE REPAIRMAN) is working on FOX’S CAR His
BLOW-TORCH glows in the night

Wesley sprints across the courtyard and out the front gate
EXT GARMENT DISTRICT - DOWNTOWN - NIGHT

He finds himself smack in the middle of the city’s textile
quarter having emerged from a building that looks more like
a medieval fortress than a modern-day GARMENT FACTORY

He DROPS THE GUN in a trash can and RUNS OFF down the street

SFX COMPUTER KEYS
22307 22

EXT WESLEY’S APARTMENT - NIGHT
We can see the BLUE GLOW of a MONITOR in Wesley’s place

WESLEY (VO)
Put “Weavers” into Google and after
some gnarly porn sites you’d be
surprised at what comes up

INT WESLEY’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Wesley works on his computer TIME all around him moves VERY
FAST We see Cathy come in try to distract him give up go
to bed -- ALL at a high rate of speed Except for WESLEY
He’s so focused the world doesn’t exist for him right now

WESLEY (VO)
A culture that goes back thousands of
years Goes back as far as man does

SCREEN SHOTS OF WEB PAGES

Some in different languages From English to Sanskrit
Pictures of spiders and gods Pictures of people READING the
weave of fabric

WESLEY (VO)
Trippy ancient myths about spiders and
webs and the strands of fate And not
just one people All peoples The
Greeks the Aztecs the Chinese

RESUME - WESLEY’S APARTMENT - DAWN

Time is marching on Cathy snores Wesley still hasn’t moved
from the computer

WESLEY (VO)
People who didn’t even know each other
existed all coming up with the same
story All finding meanings and signs
in the patterns they wove

Wesley SEES one passage that strikes him

ON SCREEN And the Weavers servants of fate If the
Oracles are the eyes the Weavers are the sword

Wesley is DISTRACTED by the STRAINS OF THAT GREEK FOLK SONG
on his unseen neighbor’s radio He checks his watch 7 AM
Time to get going
22307 23

INT WESLEY’S APARTMENT - BATHROOM

Wesley brushes his teeth and looks in the mirror He PAUSES
He’s different SOMEHOW

This is me as I begin to realize the
world looks a lot different once
youve been shot at

EXT SUPERMARKET - DAY

REPORTERS do live shots from the scene of the “yesterday’s
big shoot-out” Among the crowd is Wesley

WESLEY (VO)
Here I am starting to wonder just how
much of what we all take as gospel is
actually bullshit

Wesley moves a little closer He doesn’t notice that KANG is
shadowing him at a distance

WESLEY (VO)
For example The news

REPORTER
(to her Cameraman)
Police are saying this is clearly
another case of gang violence

Wesley stares at a WANTED SHEET -- It has drawings of what
are supposed to be Fox Cross and him But the SKETCHES look
NOTHING like them And it lists ALL THREE OF THEM as MEN

WESLEY (VO)
And eye-witness accounts

He LOOKS over -- realizes he is close to the
EXT SUPERMARKET - ATM -

Which is open for use TEMPTED Wesley crosses to it and
puts his card in He checks his balance STILL 1467

WESLEY (VO)
For a second there I almost believed
them

He’s about to go when he realizes he has a SAVINGS option on
the screen THAT’S NEW
22307 24

He hits the SAVINGS button And the machine tells him the
balance is 86714412

Wesley stares a beat Then paranoid looks around to see if
anyone else can see it He covers the screen looks at it
again Yep it’s real

He quickly hits the QUICK CASH OPTION and watches as three
hundred bucks pops out He prints his BALANCE

He hurries off didn’t see ANTON watching him either
INT WESLEY’S CUBICLE - DAY

Wesley is comparing his PRINTED BALANCE to his ON-LINE
BALANCE Both are the same In the BACKGROUND we see
Janice GETTING CHEWED OUT by her boss

WESLEY (VO)
As an accountant I know the odds of a
banking error are 1 in 200000

Wesley OPENS his desk drawer which is filled with nasal
sprays vitamins half-eaten rolls of Tums and that ATIVAN

WESLEY (VO)
Multiply that by the probability this
error will be in your favor when you
haven’t made an ATM deposit -- AND
that it will happen the day after your
supposed bad ass father has left you
his estate -- and what do you get

On Wesley’s face as a smile BLOOMS
INT WESLEY’S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

Wesley stops THE CLEANING CREW so he can dump ALL his pills
self-help books his copy of ‘the millionaire next door’

WESLEY
Not that
He grabs the ATM RECEIPT out of the pile He smiles and
turns bumping right into JANICE -- whose blood is BOILING
JANICE

Jesus H Fucking Popsicle what do you
think you’re doing You think you
can just throw out your personal
garbage in the company trash
22307 25

WESLEY
That’s what it’s for--

JANICE
Says who Who authorized you to throw
that stuff out

WESLEY
I think I’m capable of deciding--

JANICE
No you think youre special

JANICE jams her FINGER into him The world goes SLOW-MOTION

JANICE (FAINT)
You think this job is beneath you You
think you’re smarter than me

Janice’s WORDS are like the low moaning of a whale HER FAT
ROLLS which crash like some horrible earthquake Then HER
LIPS which spray saliva drops slowly into the air Then HER
EYES whose red blood vessels Wesley can see blooming

JANICE (FAINT)
You think somehow there’s something
better going to come along and until
then we should all feel sorry for you
Well give up buddy boy because you’ve
got loser tattooed on your sorry ass--

WESLEY

It’s so unbelievably stunning coming out of Wesley’s mouth
that it hits Janice like a slap in the face Heads all over
the office start to poke out of the tops of their cubicles

WESLEY
I’m sorry Janice

Is he really going to apologize No

WESLEY (CONT’D)
That since your boyfriend started
fucking Darlene

(he indicates a co-worker)
--you’ve been having self-esteem
issues And well we all know you’ve
peaked here and that the business world
isn’t exactly looking for middle-aged

WESLEY (CONT’D)

Management wannabes Too bad you
cashed in your 401K to cover those
checks mom wrote to that televangelist
but hey maybe she’1ll get into heaven

(shakes his head)
The point Janice is if you weren’t
such a bitch people around here might
feel sorry for you But as it stands
now I think I speak for the office
when I say go fuck yourself

He walks off heading out

JANICE
You are so fired mister

Fine with him He strides past his co-workers who stare at
him in awe Barry steps into the aisle for a high-five

BARRY
Who’s the man

Wesley grabs a KEYBOARD off a desk and SMASHES Barry across
the face with it sending keys and a bloody tooth flying AT
CAMERA IN SLOW-MOTION to spell “FUCK YOU”

WESLEY
I’m the man

EXT WESLEY’S OFFICE BUILDING - DAY

--until he feels A GUN at his neck

Half-day

The GUN drops Wesley turns It was FOX He EXHALES

WESLEY
As a matter of fact I just told my
boss to fuck herself and broke my best
friend’s nose

FOX
(unimpressed)
Congratulations

She walks off calling back to say

FOX
Next time it might be Cross
22307 27

WESLEY
--You don’t understand This is the
best I’ve felt in my entire life

She stops - stares at him
FOX
Actually I do understand And that’s
just the tip of an iceberg bigger than
you could possibly imagine

She indicates a CAR A “new” one Are you ready now He
nods Yeah he’s ready They walk for the car

WESLEY
Plan on knocking me out

FOX
Plan on annoying me

INT FOX’S NEW CAR - CONTINUOUS
Wesley settles in the passenger seat Looks around

WESLEY
New car

FOX
“Pre-owned”

She jams her knife into the ignition and turns the car ON
As they DRIVE OFF Fox ignores the car’s owner who runs
after them calling about his car

Wesley hasn’t seen that He’s too eager to think about what
lies ahead He turns and looks at her

WESLEY
Fox Is that your name or a title--

Wesley’s EXPRESSION changes He goes quiet REVEAL -- Fox
has taken her knife and put it against his side She smiles

You really need to re-assess the way
you speak to me

Wesley and Fox enter a cramped eclectic music store Walls
lined with GUITARS SAXOPHONES there’s even a PIANO

WESLEY
What are we

But she’s GONE out the jingly door Flipped the CLOSED sign

SLOAN (0S)
Still in one piece that’s good

Wesley sees Sloan is there Sloan takes a seat at the piano

SLOAN
Do you play

Wesley shakes his head

SLOAN
Me neither

His fingers trace a note then a second Nice simple tones

SLOAN

What do you think you know
WESLEY

Excuse me
SLOAN

Man’s greatest limits are the things
he’s sure he ‘knows’ The world is
flat Nothing heavier than air can
fly

(He plays a note)
So what do you know about us I said
enough to whet your appetite

WESLEY
You’re part of some organization

Sloan plays a note waits for Wesley to continue

WESLEY
With historical roots

Sloan plays another note

WESLEY
Some kind of assassins

Sloan plays a sour note
SLOAN

(reflective)
I hate that word
22307 29

Sloan closes the piano Heads for the guitars He plucks
individual strings as he passes He knows by not looking at
Wesley he’s forcing Wesley to follow close and pay attention

SLOAN
For thousands of years the Weavers
have in our own way helped influence
the course of events around the world

WESLEY
By killing

SLOAN
Assassins kill for money for power
even for sport Weavers do no such
thing Do I wish the world had no
need for us Perhaps But the
reality of life is sometimes you need
a nurse -- sometimes a surgeon

Sloan has found a beautiful CLASSICAL GUITAR Picks it up

SLOAN
I could end your life fifteen
different ways with this and still be
able to play it at your funeral

Wesley backs away Sloan LAUGHS Then Wesley LAUGHS

SLOAN
Really

Sloan starts playing notes on the bottom string The ‘E’

WESLEY
How do you decide who to kill

SLOAN
This string is an E This one above
it is an A If I play an A note on
the E string watch closely

ON THE GUITAR STRINGS -- Sloan plays an ‘A’ note on the ‘E’
string That string vibrates and interestingly enough the
‘A’ string then vibrates too

SLOAN
Two strings with seemingly no
connection But I do this here
(plays the note again)
And this string moves as well
Because they are connected just ina
way we can’t see In fact if you plug

And play an A loud enough you could
make every A string in the entire

Wesley looks at the Stratocaster

WESLEY
What does this have to do with--

He HEARS the JINGLY door and realizes SLOAN has left
EXT CITY CORNER - MOMENTS LATER
Wesley catches up to Sloan who is people watching

SLOAN
How many people can we see right now
Fifty How many are talking to each
other how man are even taking notice
of each other

None Most are on Blackberrys cell phones or simply
walking by each other saying nothing at all

SLOAN
Human beings have never had more ways
to communicate yet we’ve never felt
so disconnected with life The trick
with that Wesley is we’re like those
guitar strings Just because we seem
disconnected doesn’t mean we are

Fox pulls up in YET ANOTHER NEW CAR Wesley does a double-
take this woman steals with total impunity

WESLEY
Is she stealing all--

FOX
Only if you believe property is
something more than a rule made up by
the haves to control the have-nots
Sloan gets in Wesley follows
INT CAR - DRIVING THROUGH THE CITY
Wesley waits for Sloan to keep talking but he doesn’t

WESLEY
How do Weavers know who to--
22307 31

They pass by Children’s Hospital Sloan indicates

SLOAN
See that hospital Did you know that
patients in there

INT HOSPITAL - SAME TIME

A PATIENT recovers in a bed LOVED ONES with her

SLOAN (VO)
Or in any hospital who have loved
ones praying for them sending them
good thoughts -- recover faster than
those who don’t

RESUME - THE CAR

As Wesley watches the hospital disappear from view

SLOAN
Why

They pass a POLICE CAR making an arrest

He looks

SLOAN
Or take crime People try to control
it with laws police officers But in
Washington DC 4000 people devoted two
months to meditating for peace They
did nothing more than think it -- and
crime dropped 23 How

WESLEY
You still haven’t answered my
question

SLOAN

--Two examples Two of millions
from religion to physics all of which
tell us the same thing

Where that DOCTOR Sloan just saw moments ago is now having
lunch with his teary-eyed MISTRESS

causing others to vibrate in turn

The Mistress shakes her head heartbroken he’s seeming to
side with his wife But then the Doctor shocks her

blank fabric at the very bottom of the pattern

EXTREME CLOSE UP - THE FABRIC

As the LASER finishes its writing And this bottom piece of
fabric is then carved off by a computer-guided BLADE

“William R Hubbard” -- Followed by a series of numbers
representing an astrological birthdate

SLOAN
hands it to Wesley who stares at it

SLOAN
After all we are called ‘Weavers’
22307 35

Wesley LOOKS UP -- AND WE FINALLY GET A LOOK AT THE LOOM

It’s an awesome sight A mixture of old and new A massive
rickety loom fed by dozens of spools of thread looking
almost like a giant musical instrument

But then the fabric that comes out of it is pulled by
mechanized rollers and stretched long over a GLASS TABLE with
DOZENS OF HIGH-TECH INFRA-RED AND ULTRAVIOLET SENSORS
scanning and re-scanning every inch -- like something out of
the FBI CRIME LAB

Fox checks the gun makes sure it is empty before handing it
over to Wesley He LOADS in a clip raises the gun but

There’s something about the corpse of the SOCCER MOM swinging
back and forth like a pinata that makes him HESITATE

are you going to do with a live one

same chocolate-colored fluid as Wesley’s With the added

addition of a few LEECHES on his arms

It’s of Mr X Sloan and Cross Wesley stares at it So
that’s his father

SLOAN (CONTD)
We were all very close

WESLEY
What happened

SLOAN
A month ago a name came up I
couldn’t believe my eyes It was
Cross In all my years Id never
(MORE )
22307 47

SLOAN (CONTD)
seen a Weaver named I was hoping he
would accept it After all the heart
of the Fraternity is that we do what
we must do To ignore a name is as
bad as killing someone not named But
Cross didn’t see it that way He
decided there must be a mistake bad
information He decided he’d sooner
destroy us all before he’d give up his
life

Sloan TAPS HIS HAND on the stack of research on the desk
SLOAN
In here are the details of Cross’ work
through the years A greatest ‘hits’
if you will Learn them Learn him

Sloan pats Wesley on the shoulder and then LEAVES Wesley is
suddenly ALONE in the place his father called a home

INT MR X’S ROOM - A SERIES OF DISSOLVES

Wesley moves from a quick glance at the CROSS FILES to the
things he’s more interested in -- his father’s things

He looks through the books
Examines the old weapons

He looks through the clothes in the closet And TRIES one
outfit on

END DISSOLVES AS
FOX ENTERS
A normal person might laugh at how Wesley looks dressed up in
ill-fitting clothes but Fox is all business and if
anything a little UNCOMFORTABLE seeing Wesley in X’s stuff
FOX
Take those off they don’t fit you
And meet me at the matts--

WESLEY
How well did you know him

This kind of personal talk isn’t her specialty

WESLEY
My father Did you--
He turns

22307

FOX
He taught me everything I know

WESLEY

That makes one of us

(beat)
As long as I can remember I wanted to
know what my father was like I used
to pretend he was an airline pilot or
a secret agent but deep down I was
sure he was just some boring finger-
drumming schloob Like I was

to the wall of weapons

WESLEY
So you can imagine my monumental
fucking surprise at the truth He was
no ass-sucking wannabe

FOX
Neither are you

Wesley looks at her -- for a moment she is very human and

he’s touched by that

FOX
Now let’s go New weapon today

WESLEY (VO)
As an accountant the better you get
the further away you are from
people

INT FRATERNITY - CONDITIONING AREA

Then she’s back to business

Wesley and Fox are looking at a lithe linebacker of a man
dubbed THE BUTCHER due to his love of KNIVES

The BUTCHER demonstrates some deft moves with his blade

WESLEY (VO)
But when it comes to being an
assassin

FOX
The better you get the closer you can
get to your targets safely which
means you can choose a more subtle
weapon In the proper hands a knife
is every bit as dangerous as any gun
22307 49

WESLEY
Id say those are proper hands
FOX
Take a shot at him
WESLEY
What
BUTCHER

Take a shot at me you skinny fuck
dumb ass bean-counter who had to be
asked twice to come and train here--

Wesley TAKES a shot and the BUTCHER DEFLECTS it with a knife

WESLEY
That’s awesome--

The Butcher comes at him Knife swirling like a flamenco
dancer’s fan And within moments -- RIP -- TEAR -- SLICE --
Wesley’s clothes are reduced to a pile of DEBRIS at his
ankles And he is NAKED with a whole series of superficial
cuts across his body The Butcher and Fox stare

FOX
Guess it’s cold in here too

WESLEY (VO)
I’ve also graduated from shooter

INT FRATERNITY - TEXTILE PLANT

In the part of the factory which has been abandoned but is
still littered with old equipment we find WESLEY climbing a
series of ROPES that have been tied up and over the CEILING
BEAM POSTS It’s a 40 ft climb and given these ropes are
woven from light thread they BREAK if WESLEY PULLS TO HARD

From BELOW -- FOX is firing at him Forcing Wesley to stay
in ASSASSIN TIME

WESLEY (VO)
-to target

He’s about half-way up He pulls too hard and feels this
rope SNAP so he has to LEAP to another one ALL OF THIS
UNFOLDS IN ASSASSIN TIME We see a bullet ‘cruise’ by him

FOX
Assassin Time drains your body In
order to stay in it as long as
(MORE)
22307 50

FOX (CONTD)
possible you have to be delicate in
your movements

ANOTHER THREAD HE’S CLIMBING ON BREAKS AS HE CLIMBS TOO HARD
He has to LEAP from this falling thread to ANOTHER ONE

FOX
More delicate than that
WESLEY -- is sweating now Breathing hard Tiring fast
FOX

You can’t waste energy Wasted
movement will end up wasting you

WESLEY -- can’t believe how fast he’s being drained

FOX
In Assassin Time when you hit the
wall You really

WESLEY -- passes out He falls through the swirling sea of
threads and SLAMS onto the PADDED FLOOR with a resounding
THUD Totally unconscious

FOX
Exactly

INT RECOVERY ROOM - FRATERNITY

Wesley is back in a recovery bath He HEARS someone enter
behind him A ROBE drops to the floor If he realized it
was FOX he might have turned around quicker

But it’s only when he HEARS the sound of her exhaling that he
turns He can’t see anything but her head and long hair as
she relaxes in the tub across from his

FOX
How are you feeling

WESLEY
Like soup

She starts to laugh just slightly

WESLEY
I mean it Like I’m a goddamn
appetizer Somebody needs to tell the
Weavers their training is fantastic
but the recovery methods are a bit
dark ages

The first time hewe have ever heard her really laugh
22307 51

WESLEY
(reflecting)
I don’t even know long have you been
doing this Or how Why

FOX
I was fourteen My parents were not
good people A Weaver came for them
and I nearly killed her so she
brought me back here

WESLEY
That’s horrible

FOX
Before they found me life was
horrible Since - not once in all
these years have I regretted a thing
How many people can say that about
their lives

WESLEY
All I had were regrets

FOX
That’s because out there is a world of
greed A world without honor Here
we have a code A man’s nothing
without a code Wesley

He looks at her floating there just a few feet away He
wants her Wants to lean out and kiss her As if she senses
this she deftly floats back away from him

Then she GETS up totally naked Finds it sweet that Wesley
averts his eyes -- after a peek or two Maybe three
Then as she’s wrapped in a towel about to leave he asks

WESLEY
You really think I can be as good as
Cross

FOX

For all our sakes’ I hope so
She leaves him then And he considers her words

WESLEY (VO)
This is me no longer one of the most
insignificant assholes of the 21st
century

WALL and the MUSLIN SCREEN They look at it -- confused

SLOAN

-Wesley points to the SIDE WALL He’s curved a bullet SO
MUCH he’s hit THE SIDE WALL instead of the BACK WALL

Sloan begins to LAUGH

WESLEY
Because Cross works alone

RESUME INT MEN’S ROOM -

over him He dries his hands And walks out the door

INT DANCE CLUB -

We FOLLOW WESLEY as he walks out ONTO THE MAIN FLOOR and
collides with the full energy of the CLUB Rapid techno
beats shake us from the inside out -- a parade of blinding
lights and scantily clad hipsters

Wesley NOTES the location of Boukriev and his crew Then
also picks out a few fellow FRATERNITY MEMBERS as they mingle
in a dark corner by the bar Fox Kang Anton and Iris
WESLEY
(to himself)
So much for alone
POV - FOX - DANCE CLUB

She watches as Wesley weaves through the crowd -- bodies
pulsing in unison -- a contrast to his glide

As he TALKS to a group of DRUNK BACHELORETTES One of them
laughs at something he says and puts one of her obnoxious

a nearby WAITRESS
As the WAITRESS comes over Wesley in one motion takes a
bottle of CRISTAL and a PEN off her tray and drops several
HUNDREDS to end any argument that it’s for another patron

flips the -- FIRE ALARM

ALARM BELLS ring The MUSIC stops The fairy tale is over
as the lights come up and EVERYONE starts for an exit Fox

and the other Weavers have no choice have to leave too

Bodies file off the MAIN FLOOR like sand draining from an
hourglass until we’re staring at a silent empty dance floor

FIVE PEOPLE DON’T LEAVE -- DON’T EVEN MOVE

Fox and the other Weavers HEAR A WOMAN SCREAM They catch a
glimpse of the CARNAGE just before they walk out

IN THE SECOND BOOTH

The angry BURN of ethyl alcohol consumes LIEUTENANT 4s
entire FACE Fueled by the now empty vodka glass in his hand
and his own CIGAR embedded in his eye

Next to him LIEUTENANT 3 has been strangled by the GLOW
NECKLACE LIEUTENANT 2 has the PEN right through his neck

IN THE FIRST BOOTH

LIEUTENANT 1 has been shot by his own silenced-gun -- An
elephant-sized bullet through his chest
22307 57

But he’s lucky compared to BOUKRIEV -- who has had that
entire bottle of Cristal shoved down his throat

intercepts it and offers hers instead

FOX

It’s about time a girlfriend gives you
something besides gonorrhea

WESLEY
How about we split it

Chuck no fool suddenly realizes this might be a real sale

WESLEY (FILTERED)
How do I look

FOX
The car looks great

She can hear his laugh THEN SHE HEARS SOMETHING ELSE--
--GUNFIRE She watches as Wesley’s rear windshield
disintegrates And his right front tire is SHOT OUT causing
him to SWERVE

THEN HER VIEW BECOMES OBSCURED AS BULLETS RAIN DOWN ON HER
SIROCCO

Ducking for cover she throws her car in reverse as all of
its GLASS gets splintered by gunfire
22307 62

She BACKS OUT OF THE LINE OF FIRE into an ALLEY

EXT DOWNTOWN ALLEY - CONTINUOUS

Fox rolls out her driver’s side door taking cover

HER POV

She can tell the gunfire is coming from AN OFFICE BUILDING
And she can see Wesley’s car Can’t tell if he’s okay Then

she remembers THE CELL PHONE They might still be connected

FOX
Wesley Wesley are you okay

It’s Cross

That’s not fear in his voice It’s DETERMINATION And she

EXT DOWNTOWN - ASSASSIN TIME

Wesley SPRINTS across the street dodging bullets that come
CURVING out of the darkness from above

And dodging CARS moving in slow-motion coming at him

HE MAKES IT ONTO THE SIDEWALK

Where the rain of bullets keeps him in Assassin Time He
passes PEDESTRIANS pretty much frozen in position like
pieces of sculpture Odd shapes because they are all ducking
from the unseen gunfire

INT LOBBY -

He makes it into the lobby and breaks OUT of Assassin Time
He’s already winded Sweating profusely

He SENDS an Elevator up to the 20th floor hoping it will be
a decoy Then turns back to HEAD UP THE STAIRS

INT STAIRWELL -

Wesley tries to stalk quietly up the stairs But he HEARS
THE SHARP SNAPS OF GUNFIRE ECHOING FROM ABOVE

THROWING HIM BACK INTO ASSASSIN TIME -- in order to DODGE the
deadly stream of TWISTING BULLETS coming in at impossible
angles

But two can play at that game Wesley anchors himself
laying flat on the staircase and UNLOADS his own barrage

HE GETS A BREAK FROM ASSASSIN TIME

Breathing heavier now He starts to once again work his way
carefully and quietly UP the stairs

INT STAIRWELL LANDING -

Wesley tries to rest a bit but SUDDENLY HEARS MORE NOISE --
SENDING HIM BACK INTO ASSASSIN TIME AGAIN

This time it’s not bullets It’s pens
Cross has obviously raided some office and is DROPPING

ANYTHING that will echo and fall to KEEP WESLEY IN ASSASSIN
TIME (thus tiring him out) WITHOUT WASTING AMMUNITION

WESLEY
(realizing that)
Shit
22307 64

Wesley makes a bold move bounding up the stairs FIRING
trying to close the distance to his unseen enemy

A HORRIBLE BARRAGE

Of mundane office supplies mixed with deadly bullets rains
down on Wesley who climbs fires and dodges

But it is QUICKLY TIRING And then something happens

Wesley’s foot SLIPS on a few of the falling otherwise
harmless pens And his ANKLE TWISTS UNNATURALLY

HE SCREAMS

And collapses on the ground holding his ankle He’s bathed
in sweat now

HE REACHES
For his cell phone NO SIGNAL
HE HEARS

The unmistakable sound of FOOTSTEPS ECHOING ABOVE HIM as
CROSS is BOUNDING DOWN the stairs in the darkness

WESLEY TURNS

And looks at the stairwell door It has a keypad He SHOOTS
it and STUMBLING the best he can DISAPPEARS out of the
stairs and onto the DARKENED OFFICE FLOOR

EXT ALLEY - BY THE SIROCCO - SAME

Fox waiting patiently is glad to see the cavalry arrive
the team from the nightclub Anton Kang and Iris

ANTON
Where is he

Fox points to the office building

EXT DOWNTOWN - MOMENTS LATER

Following in Wesley’s footsteps Fox and her group RACE
towards the OFFICE BUILDING Unlike Wesley they DON’T HAVE
TO DODGE GUNFIRE Only CARS

At least that’s the way it seems until we hear a SINGLE SHOT
ring out above and

IRIS
22307 65

Drops like a sack of rocks Dead even before the TAXI CAB
runs over her fallen body

KANG
Iris--

FOX
She’d dead Come on

The three of them race towards the lobby

INT CORPORATE OFFICE SPACE - TWELFTH FLOOR

Wesley is NOT WELL and he knows it

He has taken up a defensive position protected by a CUBICLE
in this large maze of corporate space His breathing is
rapid and shallow His color pale His hands shaking as he
trains his gun at the STAIRWELL DOOR

THE DOOR OPENS And Wesley fires

ONLY TO REALIZE THE DOOR DIDN’T OPEN -- IT EXPLODED

Hit by gunfire from the other direction

WESLEY PIVOTS

But it’s too late That stairwell door is WIDE OPEN CROSS
is now somewhere on this floor

In the heart of the maze Wesley freezes LISTENING to every
noise trying to hold his shivering breath as CROSS’S
FOOTSTEPS get closer CLOSER

THINGS BEGIN TO EXPLODE IN THE DARKNESS

As Cross BLASTS the water cooler Then takes out entire
CUBICLE PARTITIONS He’s deliberately disorienting Wesley
KEEPING WESLEY IN ASSASSIN TIME with his blasts

The slow-motion world like a nightmare to Wesley now
Shadowy monsters and forms and low moaning noises like when
CROSS activates the XEROX MACHINE and Wesley BLASTS it

WESLEY

Is running out of time Cross’s seems to be everywhere at
once Wesley’s heart is pounding so hard it threatens to

explode in his chest Trapped like a rat nowhere to run
Wesley is reduced to the barest emotions The pain The

fear He shouldn’t have come after Cross alone
22307 66

WESLEY LOADS A CLIP IN HIS GUN AND TAKES A DEEP BREATH

He can barely get the clip in that how much his hand is
shaking

HE STARES AT A GLOWING EXIT SIGN

And makes a hobbled run for it

FOLLOWING WESLEY - ASSASSIN TIME

Wesley races for the door looking over his shoulder and
trying to fire as BULLETS CURVE OUT OF THE DARKNESS BEHIND
HIM

--AND HIT HIM

POOF SPLAT THUNK

Wesley is hit in his side His leg His upper back

He COLLAPSES in pain and total exhaustion

WESLEY’S POV

As he lies on the ground helpless He sees the DARK FORM of
Cross step out into the office corridor Coming for him
slowly inexorably

He’s about to die

The last thing he senses are SHAPES ABOVE AND BEHIND HIM He
SEES bullets flying over his head from behind Then arms
and bodies

It’s KANG ANTON AND FOX

We STAY with WESLEY’S ASSASSIN TIME POV as he begins to pass
out He sees KANG’S NECK explode from a bullet

collapses in convulsions He GASPS

uncomfortable that she wants it to

sorrow ECHOES in the large room

by date -- Month after month Year after year

SLOAN

Sits at his desk Spread across it are more BINDERS
including one OPEN ONE in which we can see some of THE LASER
ETCHED FABRIC NAMES the loom has provided through the years

SLOAN’S OFFICE DOOR OPENS
After a soft knock It’s Fox Sloan closes that binder

FOX
He’s awake

Sloan is particularly sullen As low as weve ever seen him
Fox assumes it is because of Wesley’s behavior

FOX
I take responsibility I pushed him
too fast Didn’t prepare him for the
emotions associated with revenge

Sloan WAVES off her explanation

SLOAN
We were able to trace some of the
fragments we pulled out of him
They’re a ceramic blend it enhances
Cross’ ability to curve shots Only a
handful of people are capable of
making them including a dealer named
Pekwar in the Czech Republic

FOX
Where Cross was born

SLOAN
I’ve spoken to our members in Prague
Cross was spotted there two hours ago

FOX
(confused by his demeanor)
That’s good news

Sloan nods

Fox blinks What

For only the second time in my life I
almost tossed it right in the fire
But we have no choice Once we get
Cross we have to get Wesley

He looks at her Can you It’s the most difficult test of
the code she lives by that she’s ever faced But she NODS

FOX
When the time comes -- I’1l do it

You know what’s a joke Those
clothes

Meaning Mr Xs

WESLEY (CONT’D)
They don’t fit And yet I keep
trying them on I’ve spent weeks in
this room hoping somehow to feel some
connection to my father hoping to
feel like I was a part of him because
I didn’t have that growing up I
didn’t have a family And the great
irony is I’ve been so busy trying to
connect with him a dead man that I
didn’t even realize I was discovering
a family In Sloan in Kang Anton
You

He stares at her

WESLEY
And I killed them

FOX
Wesley you have to stop now

WESLEY
And I put you in jeopardy

She fights to maintain her stoic demeanor
WESLEY
(he looks at her)
If anything ever happened to you

She turns away

WESLEY
I’m sorry I didn’t mean to

Fox finds herself unable to face him Searching her mind
she knows there’s one thing that will make him feel
infinitely better
22307 72

FOX
The fragments they took from you --
they traced them to the Czech
Republic The Weavers there are going
to go after Cross--

Wesley’s chair SQUEALS as he pushes it back from his desk

SLOAN (PRE-LAP)
No

INT SLOAN’S OFFICE
Wesley pleads his case to Sloan as Fox watches

WESLEY
Hear me out

SLOAN
You haven’t even made a full recovery
yet Not to mention nothing that
happened suggests you are capable of
handling Cross even if you were 100
percent

WESLEY
My ego is what got me not Cross
Besides he’s smart And if he’s
anywhere near Prague he’s on home
turf You think he won’t hear about
the Weavers over there looking for
him

Fox looks at Sloan Wesley’s got a point

WESLEY
You wanted me to know Cross well I
know Cross Right now he’s hunting
us And the only chance we have is to
do something he doesn’t expect And
what he doesn’t expect is for us to
hunt him Certainly not me not on
his home turf only days after he
nearly killed me

Sloan exhales Looks at Fox

SLOAN
What do you think

Fox levels a long sad LOADED stare at Sloan
22307 73

I think sending the two of us makes a
lot of sense
SFX CITY STREETS
EXT PRAGUE CZECH REPUBLIC - ESTABLISHING - DAY
The City of 100 Spires spreads out before our eyes

EXT KARLUV MOST BRIDGE - SAME

Wesley and Fox appear to be strolling ‘casually’ just two
more tourists crossing the Vltava river

EXT OLD TOWN HALL - PRAGUE - LATER

And passing the famous ASTRONOMICAL CLOCK at the Old Town
Hall

EXT A COBBLESTONE STREET - SAME

They slow as they approach their destination -- an
unremarkable looking CLOCK SHOP nestled among other shops
down the street

FOX
That’s the one I’m sure of it

FOX AND WESLEY

Pause to look in the windows of CANDY STORE opposite the
clock shop In the REFLECTION of the window they have a
pretty good view of the clock shop storefront itself

WESLEY
What makes you say so

A FEW FEATURES of it strike Fox as telling

FOX
For one that’s a pretty nice security
camera for a clock shop

There is a SECURITY CAMERA pointed at its door The only
camera of its kind on the street Then there is the matter
of the now-opened SECURITY GATES ON THE GLASS

WESLEY
The bars on the windows are thicker
than any you find in Garfield Park

THEY CROSS TOWARDS THE SHOP
22307

Fox turns to Wesley

FOX
Remember we need to be sure it’s
Pekwar himself

INT CLOCK SHOP - MOMENTS LATER

At the counter an unremarkable Czech gentleman PEKWAR is
repairing the movement on a delicate Ulysses Nardin when --
his DOOR CHIME sounds He looks at his

SECURITY MONITOR

Sees Wesley and Fox

HE BUZZES THEM IN

Pegs them as American Honeymooners

They enter and do their best to play the role Pekwar

expects

FOX
This place is amazing

WESLEY
I don’t know it looks expensive
Something tells me if he can fix it
it’s going to cost a pretty penny

Wesley angles so he is FAR TO ONE SIDE of the shop Fox
approaches Pekwar at the counter

FOX
(‘trying’ her Czech)
Dobr den

PEKWAR
How can I help you

FOX
(smiles )
Oh you speak English
(turns to Wesley)
He speaks English baby

WESLEY
Great

She pulls a beautiful Patek Phillpe from her bag
wrapped it in such a way to convey it’s an heirloom

She’s
22307 75

FOX
(hands it to Pekwar)
I was wondering if you might be able
to fix this

Wesley is now COMPLETELY to the side of Pekwar

PEKWAR
What is the problem
FOX
The movement Sometimes it gets

stuck
As Pekwar examines it Wesley looks at a clock

WESLEY
(calls casually)
Pekwar

Pekwar turns instinctively And before he realizes he’s been
had -- he feels FOX’S GUN at his head It makes a nice firm
CLICK as the hammer locks into place

FOX
This on the other hand still works
like a charm

Wesley LOCKS the front door Pekwar is cool he doesn’t
panic He acts like he’s just a simple clock maker

PEKWAR
I don’t have much money

WESLEY
(crossing towards him)
No We’re here to return this

He SLAMS one of the bullet fragments onto the counter top

WESLEY
Seems I found it in my side

PEKWAR
I fix watches

WESLEY
Where’s Cross

PEKWAR
What is Cross

Wesley laughs Fox smiles
22307 76

FOX
Good Since you don’t know Cross you
won’t mind us going around telling
people that ‘Pekwar told us where to
find him’

She lowers her gun She and Wesley turn to walk out
Before they make it to the door they HEAR Pekwar reach for
something

BANG

Before Pekwar can fully raise it Fox has spun and fired
blowing it out of his hands It wasn’t a gun It was a NEW
BOX OF SHELL CASINGS he’s just made for Cross The casings
fall to the ground with a sound that’s like rain on glass

PEKWAR
That’s part of an order for him

WESLEY
Then youll deliver it And you won’t
do anything to tip him off Because
if you do we won’t need to kill you
He’1l do it just to be safe

FOX
Where are we going

SFX THE WIND
EXT ABANDONED TRAIN STATION - DAY

Like something out of a Western What was formerly a stop on
the international line is now just a home for spiders

PEKWAR strides across the abandoned platform He places a
BRIEFCASE by the tracks and WALKS off

FOX (PRE-LAP)
Cross picked a great spot

INT ABANDONED STATION - 2ND FLOOR OFFICES
Where FOX AND WESLEY wait

FOX
if he’s worried about an ambush

Wesley watches as Pekwar gets in his car -- the only one in
the parking lot EXCEPT FOR AN OLD SUV Wesley checks his
watch It’s 254 He looks at a TRAIN SCHEDULE
22307 77

WESLEY
And weve got five trains coming
through here in the next half hour
Fox scans the horizon with her SNIPER SCOPE

FOX
Here’s the first

FOX POV - SNIPER SCOPE
A TRAIN approaches the station
WESLEY AND FOX

Watch as the TRAIN rumbles through the station Their eyes
glued on the BRIEFCASE It never moves

The TRAIN recedes into the distance The RUMBLING noise
dies Once again it’s quiet

WESLEY
We’re missing something He used
something like this before

FOX
You think he knows we’re here

WESLEY
(beat)
Maybe you should leave
She looks at him

WESLEY (CONT’D)
Use me to draw him out

FOX
Wesley I can take care of myself
Lest you forget I saved your ass

He smiles

WESLEY
Train

WESLEY AND FOX

Take their positions Poised to fire at anything or anyone
that gets near that briefcase

This TRAIN is even LOUDER than the first It SHAKES the old
station as it THUNDERS BY
22307 78

Wesley’s finger teases the trigger of his rifle but

Nothing happens The briefcase is STILL THERE And this
TRAIN also recedes into the distance

WESLEY
I was this close to blowing a hole
through that briefcase for nothing

She smiles

FOX
Me too

For a moment there is a break in the tension

WESLEY
We make a good team huh
She nods
WESLEY
Train

THEY TURN AND WATCH

As the FASTEST TRAIN yet comes ROARING through the station
It whips up a WICKED WIND as it barrels through Wesley and
Fox look up as it disappears down the tracks

WESLEY
Three down two to

ANGLE ON THE BRIEFCASE

It’s been KNOCKED on its side NEARLY fell off the edge of
the platform It DANGLES there The next train will HIT it

WESLEY
Shit

They both scan the horizon No trains

WESLEY
I’1l go--

FOX
Ill go Cover me

Fox HURRIES out Something about this situation doesn’t sit
right with Wesley But he’s not sure why He WATCHES the
platform like a hawk as
22307 79

EXT PLATFORM
Fox comes down to the ground floor and surveys the area
INT ABANDONED STATION - 2ND FLOOR OFFICES

Wesley makes another scan through his SNIPER SCOPE Nothing
and no one in sight In fact it’s almost too quiet

SUDDENLY -- Wesley remembers what he was thinking of before
And he WHIPS HIS SCOPE AROUND TO FOX--

HIS POV

She’s about to start towards the briefcase
WESLEY drops his rifle and RACES out

EXT PLATFORM - MOMENTS LATER

Fox is nearly at the briefcase when WESLEY GRABS HER FROM
BEHIND COVERING HER MOUTH He motions -- shush

WESLEY
(whispers)
I know where I remembered this from
It was a hit But he wasn’t ona

Wesley approaches the platform’s edge slowly Handgun out
he KNEELS DOWN And just as he starts to peek his head over
the edge BOOM DOWN through the platform to reveal --

CROSS

-- right there Guns out and ready Cross and Wesley’s
faces are separated by only an INCH of platform concrete

WESLEY LOOKS AT FOX

They BLAST AWAY beneath the platform When it’s clear
nothing could have survived that they look underneath --

But Cross is gone

FOX
Shit

A NOISE GETS THEIR ATTENTION Another TRAIN is coming into
the station Guns ready Fox and Wesley look for Cross as
22307 80

THE TRAIN passes through Suddenly CROSS darts out from
beneath a different section of the platform and races ACROSS
the track

WESLEY
There

The TRAIN passes between them and CROSS Through the flicker
of train windows they see Cross FIRE AT THEM

FOX
Wesley

Fox and Wesley return fire We FLY WITH --

POV - WESLEYS BULLET (ASSASSIN TIME AS NEEDED)

As it PIERCES the window and TRAVELS THROUGH the train car
NARROWLY MISSING a half-dozen passengers to EXIT through the
window on the opposite side and -- SPANG -- ricochet off the

platform wall an inch behind Cross

The gun battle continues as Cross fires back and we TRACK
WITH HIS BULLETS LANCING through the train car CURVING

around passengers to -- THWAP THWAP -- JUST MISS FOX
Cross’ shots FORCE HER to take cover -- SEPARATING HER FROM
WESLEY -- almost as if this is Cross’ real objective

Wesley FIRES again but as we track with it this time his
bullet COLLIDES with Cross’ in mid air

EXT ABANDONED STATION PLATFORM - CONTINUOUS

The TRAIN is about to speed out of the station CROSS looks
at FOX and then at WESLEY Wesley is close to the train BUT
FOX is not

CROSS decides to leap onboard the train WESLEY chases
pouring on the speed He’s gonna miss it

But as the platform ends and the train streaks out of the
station Wesley LEAPS off of a light pole and

come shrieking onto the road that runs parallel with the
train Fox keeps the pedal to the metal while

WESLEY

is running through a PASSENGER CAR

SUDDENLY he’s SEIZED from behind One arm choking the life
from him while the other grips his gun hand immobilizing
it trying to take the gun

It’s CROSS

FOX’S POV - FROM THE SUV

Fox sees the struggle through the train window And despite
the fact she’s driving she steadies her aim And FIRES

TRACK WITH THE BULLET as it arcs through the air SHATTERS
the train window and -- WHAM -- catches CROSS between the
shoulder blades KNOCKING him off Wesley

By the time Wesley recovers and swivels with his gun Cross
is already in the next car

INT SUV - CONTINUOUS

Fox sees Wesley blindly pursuing Cross She FLOORS the
accelerator But
22307 82

FOX
Oh shit

HER POV OF THE ROAD AHEAD --

The road and the train track SPLIT WAYS -- the train will be
heading OVER A BRIDGE while the road veers off AROUND IT

Fox needs to think of something -- fast

She cranks the wheel hard The SUV SWERVES off the road
Hits a DRAINAGE DITCH AT FULL SPEED and goes AIRBORNE

The SUV sails through the air and -- WHAAAAMMM -- BASHES
through the thin metal skin of one of the TRAIN CARS

The stress of the SUV crash FRACTURES A BOLT on one of the
WHEELS of the train carriage assembly

FOX slips from the truck She sees the gunfight a FEW CARS
ahead and he races forward to join it

BOOM UP THROUGH the roof and SOAR above the train to see
they’re now on the bridge and CROSSING --

A BREATHTAKING GORGE

With a thousand foot drop to the river below

A FEW CARS AHEAD

Wesley charges after Cross Both men firing

Their bullets CURVE and SWERVE but always meet in the
middle slamming together with otherworldly precision Each

man using the exact same techniques at the exact same time

Then suddenly they both run EMPTY Wesley RELOADS but Cross
breaks the mirrored action and RACES into the next car

enters a moment later gun in hand they PANIC One of the

Instantly the entire train BUCKS as the wheels lock
screaming against the rails

Just as the engine clears the bridge and enters the tunnel on
the other side the entire train SEIZES

INT PASSENGER CAR

Wesley’s feet are thrown out from under him the physics
HURLING him across the floor - propelling him towards Cross

And even though Wesley’s body is flying out of control at 60
miles an hour he still manages to fire at Cross

EXT GORGE

Like a kid’s toy the PASSENGER CARS JUMP THE TRACK and fold
at the couplings piling up on each otheruntil the last
car SPILLS OVER the side

A FEW CARS BACK

Fox sees the train’s rear-most car topple into SPACE -- But
rather than FALL alone its coupling holdsand thus it
DRAGS the next car over Then the NEXT and the NEXT

Fox realizes what is happening and SPRINTS FORWARD

INT PASSENGER CAR

Wesley and Cross’s world goes FROM HORIZONTAL TO VERTICAL as
their car is YANKED off the bridge and SWINGS through space

SMAAAASH The concussion is TITANIC as the chain of train

Wesley dazedlooks up and sees Cross moving out of this car
and into the next CLIMBING the train’s seat backs like a

padded staircase

Wesley starts scrambling up the seat backs as fast as he can
Both men beginning to TIRE from all the hard work

Just as Wesley makes it into the NEXT CAR --

CRACK The coupling BREAKS and the section of five cars
right BENEATH HIS FEET go PLUNGING to their doom below

Wesley REACTS to the sight -- and climbs like hell

Bound up the vertical passenger cars Both men quickly
reaching the LIMITS of their ENDURANCE

It gets worse The weight of the dangling train begins to
pull the cars already in the tunnel back OUT

Wesley and Cross race up the inside of the train

Cross makes it into the lead car -- the STARLIGHT CAR --
where the ceiling is made of glass so you can view the sky

Wesley LEAPS up through the door STRETCHING as hard as he
can to reach the safety rail of the starlight car

but misses by an inch

Gravity asserts itself Wesley begins to PLUMMET back into
the gorge --

A strong hand CATCHES HIM HOLDS him over the thousand foot
drop

it nears the water both ends of the upside-down car TOUCH
the opposite walls of the gorge

With a shower of SPARKS the car’s descent SLOWS its ends
COMPACTING and CRUMPLING as the gorge walls NARROW crushing
the car smaller and smaller until it comes to a stop 150 feet
above the water With the car upside-down

Wesley and Cross both lay prone on the glass roof which is
now a glass floor BLOOD is pouring out of ONE OF THEM

It’s Cross

Wesley struggles to his feet and looks down at the MORTALLY
WOUNDED man who killed his father Wesley loads a fresh clip
into his weapon Time to finish this

Cross can’t believe he’s been shot He looks at WESLEY

CROSS
Guess I missed one of your bullets

Wesley stares What was that

CROSS
(barely breathing)
Sorry about your friends Had to
shoot you Get you away Get you
to find me

What did you say

CROSS
They’re lying to you Son

(aims at his forehead)
WHAT THE FUCK DID YOU SAY

Cross’ EYES CLOSE as he dies Wesley TUCKS his gun in his
pocket and CROUCHES down

WESLEY
WHAT DID YOU SAY WHAT THE FUCK DID
YOU SAY

Then he HEARS the CLICK OF a gun being COCKED behind him He
sees FOX in the reflection of the glass her gun zeroed in
for a kill

He turns around

FOX

FOX
What weapon do you use against the
deadliest man alive The one he won’t
kill - no matter what

Wesley surreptitiously fingers the trigger of the gun resting
in his pocket -- the one pointing face down
22307 87

WESLEY
Has this been the plan all along
Throw away your weapon once it has
done its job

FOX
Your name came up after he killed
Kang and the others

WESLEY
Yeah Did you see it

Washes over Fox Just enough for -- BANG

REBOUNDING off toppling walls
22307 95

And as Wesley jumps to a second floor and pulls himself up
the building is swallowed in smoke and dustand EVERYTHING
GOES WHITE

INT WHITE OUT

Gunfire stops and the world goes silent

Wesley pads through the eerie factory when --

SFX A floorboard CREAKS

Wesley wheels around and glimpses MOVEMENT through the
fogthat materializes into the demonic shape of THE BUTCHER

bearing down on him at full-speed Wesley tries to bring his
guns up but --

THE BUTCHER SLASHES high SLICING WESLEYS CHEEK Disappears
back into the mist

Wesley tries to move tries to find cover The suspense is
intense And then like a nightmare --

SFX Another floorboard SQUEAKS

Wesley turns again as The Butcher runs past a phantom in the
fog He SLICES again with his blade this time taking off
the top part of Wesley’s ear

Wesley fires after him but the man disappears into the
smoke

SFX CREEEEEEK

This time Wesley reacts faster Turns sees The Butcher
coming knives in each hand charging like a bull

Wesley fires BLAM BLAM But --
TING TING The Butcher deflects the bullets with the knives

in his hands LASHES OUT as he passes STABBING Wesley
through the forearm as he passes

But this time we TRACK WITH --
THE BUTCHER

-- as he disappears into the fog He turns for another pass
at Wesley but when he chargesWesley is gone

Senses on alert The Butcher moves silently through the
smoke stalking Wesley until --
22307 96

Up ahead he spots Wesley’s SILHOUETTE

Readying for the coup de grace The Butcher stalks forward
eases up behind Wesley -- and stabs him in the head

The knife embeds itself deeply -- THUNKK -- and that’s when
Wesleys longcoat falls away REVEALING the thing he stabbed
isn’t Wesleys headbut a SPOOL OF YARN balanced on top of
Wesleys feet

Wesley is standing on his hands upside-down

BUTCHERS POV

As Wesley grabs his legs and FLIPS over while ripping the
knife from the spool STABBING The Butcher in the face and
WHIPPING him down to the floor Dead before he can even

gasp

Wesley doesn’t waste a second charging ahead into --
SLOAN’S OFFICE

where Sloan stands before his desk Wesley storms forward

gun out The entire building SHUDDERS LURCHES It’s
terrifying but Wesley and Sloan could care less

SLOAN

I told you you’d be unstoppable
WESLEY

It was the one thing you said that was

true
SFX THE SOUNDS OF MANY GUNS BEING COCKED BEHIND HIM

A dozen FRATERNITY MEMBER gun barrels press up against the
back of Wesleys head Including Fox’s All furious for
having just watched their brethren downstairs die

Slowly Wesley thumbs the MAGAZINE RELEASE CATCH on his gun
It falls to the floor with a thud Racks the slide then
drops the gun

SLOAN
Was it

WESLEY
You all think I’m the traitor

Carefully Wesley removes a patch of fabric from his pocket
Holds it up for all to see The KILL ORDER for SLOAN
22307 97

Everyone stares in disbelief Fox most of all

FOX
Sloan

WESLEY
You broke your own sacred rules When
your name came on the chopping block
my father tried to do the right thing
and stand against you

As the truth dawns all the guns turn from Wesley to Sloan

WESLEY (CONTD)
No man can escape his fate Sloan
Not even you

And even though Wesley has just pronounced the man’s death
sentence Sloan allows himself a small smile

FOX
Is it true

The moment hangsthen Sloan nods

SLOAN
It is
(beat)
--but not the whole truth Fate
didn’t ask for just my head

Sloan pulls UNFASTENS A BINDER and DUMPS the contents on the
floor

Patches of FABRIC spill across the desktop eyes WIDEN as the
assassins around Wesley see THEIR NAMES revealed on different
Kill Orders

SLOAN (CONTD)
It asked for all of yours too

They all stare at their own death sentences

SLOAN (CONTD)
It asked for an end to the Fraternity
And end to thousands of years of
service Ask yourselves does that
sound good for the world

Sloan meets each of their gazes
22307 98

SLOAN (CONTD)
Now for those of you experiencing a
crisis of faith I invite you to take
your gun put it in your mouth and
pull the trigger Because that’s the
future Wesley demands for you But
for the rest of you for those of you
who want to live today is the start
of a new era Where we choose our
path Where we control destiny and
not the other way around

Sloan finishes taking in each person around him

SLOAN (CONTD)
The choice is yours

The tension is a living thing For a moment no one moves
But then one by one the gun barrels turnuntil they’re
all aimed back at Wesley

SLOAN
(to Wesley)
It seems you misjudged the strength of
human self-preservation Just like
your father did

FOX (0S)
Where’s the one with Wesley’s name

A lone gun remains on Wesley’s side It belongs to Fox

FOX
Where’s the one with Wesley’s name

Sloan’s silence makes it clear There is none

FOX
So then the code of this new
organization is we kill who suits us
Sounds suspiciously like every other
piece of shit power structure on this
planet--

BOOOM She kills the guy closest to Wesley And in the
heartbeat that everyone pieces what just happened together --

FOX tosses her guns to Wesley snatching two more from that
Weaver’s collapsing body as she whirls into Wesleys arms

And the room ERUPTS IN GUNFIRE

BOOMBOOOMBOOMBOOMBOOM
22307 99

It’s Normandy and Iwo Jima packed into a 15’ x 20’ office

The others try to return fire but Wesley and Fox are too
fast WHIRLING through the forest of bodies in a dance of
death Weavers fall like wheat before the scythe of the four-
armed semi-auto god whirling firing reloading

VFX As one Fraternity Member fires at them Wesley shoots
his bullets in mid-air -- BANKING them like an expert pool
player into the face and bodies of other assassins

BOOMBOOMBOOMBOOMBOOM

Wesley and Fox move impossibly fast assassins at the height
of their game Never presenting a clear target

One by one their would-be murderers fall to incredible
shots until the room is CLEAR

Wesley moves an arm to pull Fox behind him as he fires a shot
to the side -- he turns with surprise when she COLLAPSES to
THE GROUND

BLOOD starts to pool under his feet as he realizes she’s been
SHOT He leans down still spinning and shooting Bullets
whizzing past his head

WESLEY
Stay with me

FOX turns her head toward Wesley sees him dancing above her
avoiding shots and taking deadly ones

FOX
Sorry Wesley

WESLEY
(leaning in)
Stay with me

FOX
(weak)
I can’t keep up with you anymore

WESLEY
But we make a good team

FOX
(shakes her head)
You saw that binder You’ve got a
lot of work to do
22307 100

Her head drops to the floor he tries to revive her but
can’t He tends to her but is DISTRACTED BY THE SIGHT OF --

SLOAN

in the doorway Wesley raises his guns to fire but Sloan
ducks away with frightening speed

WESLEY is after him in a heartbeat racing out into the
CORRIDOR where he catches a glimpse of Sloan ducking into
the room containing the Loom of Fate

Wesley rushes headlong after him

INT LOOM CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS

The billowing clouds of THICK SMOKE and CHOKING DUST offer
only eerie glimpses of the insane spiderweb within Ten
thousand threads criss-crossing the room in every direction

all feeding into the Great Loom

The floor QUIVERS and CREAKS under the strain of supporting
the Loom’s immense weight after the blast

As Wesley rushes in the door SLAMS closed behind him
trapping him in the MURKY HAZE

Wesley FIRES in the direction of the door but a loud SPANG
of metal says he clearly missed his target

SLOAN (0S)
You may have trained with Fox And
you may have studied your father

Sloan’s voice seems to emanate from everywhere Wesley tries
to pinpoint it and FIRES

SPANG SPANG Miss But --
BOOM

WESLEY
Aaaughh --

A bullet rips through Wesleys leg

SLOAN (0S)
--but you never read my file

Wesley fires at where he saw the muzzle flash SPANG
SPANG The shots miss by a mile

As Wesley fumbles in the dark REVERSE ANGLE TO FIND
22307 101

SLOAN

Sitting atop the Loom Like a spider at the center of its
web he holds skeins of threads feeling the strands for --

WESLEY

-- who is bleeding badly As he moves through the dark his
foot BRUSHES a GREEN THREAD

---which then MOVES in Sloan’s hand revealing his location

BOOM A shot PIERCES Wesleys foot

WESLEY
--fuckaauughh

SLOAN (0S)
We’re all infinitely connected

Wesley turns and fires his gun -- SPANG SPANG

WESLEY
(through gritted teeth)
Goddamn it

SLOAN is enjoying this He waits with his fingers on the
strings fishing as --

WESLEY carefully picks his way through the room Avoiding
thread after threadbut he doesn’t see the slender one
brushing his hand until it’s too late

As it pulls SLOAN feels it slipping over his fingers and
FIRES

BOOM

The bullet zips through the middle of Wesleys left hand
spinning him on his feet

SLOAN (0S)
I play my A-string over here

WESLEY

FIRES -- SPANG SPANG -- then MOVES DODGING through the
web of threads toward the Loom at the center The web gets
thicker and thicker until --

Wesley can’t move Forward or back He’s utterly SURROUNDED
by threads Knowing his next move will be his last he
freezes in place Trapped
22307 102

SLOAN

waits patiently Feeling no movement But knowing Wesley is
trapped

WESLEY

Looks around for any escapethen SPOTS something On the
ceiling above The FIRE SPRINKLER Wesley can’t reach it
but a delicate line of threads passes just beneath

Pulling a LIGHTER from his pocket Wesley lights a single
thread by his handand like the fuse of a bomb the flame
slowly CLIMBS

REVERSE ANGLE TO SLOAN

Across the room seeing a faint ORANGE GLOW through the thick
clouds

BACK TO SHOT

As the bullets pass over Wesley And the flame CLIMBS
Zigzaging from one thread to the next to the next

and finally beneath the sensor

FWOOOOSSSH The sprinkler goes off and as the water rains
down the CLOUD OF DUST quickly settles

Gun out Wesley scans the room for Sloan We’re surprised
he’s no longer atop the Loom

-but that’s because he’s CREEPING UP BEHIND WESLEY

Wesley turns but Sloan grabs a thick snarl of threads and
WHIPS HIS WRIST sending a loop SURGING across the room in
the blink of an eye to WRAP AROUND Wesleys gun hand

Wesleys gun goes FLYING Bouncing through a GAPING HOLE in
the floorboards to the shop below

WIDE ANGLE

Sloan moves through the surreal environment like a Weaver
god GRIPPING skeins of threads and WHIPPING them at Wesley
It’s a virtuoso performance TRAPPING Wesleys limbs
WRAPPING them around his neck STRANGLING him with them

Wesley struggles but it’s no use Sloan is too skilled
Too damn strong
22307 103

SLOAN
And you feel it over there

As the cords cut into his NECK Wesley’s lungs rebel heaving
for air that will not come His face goes red Purple

And as he sags to his knees --
POV - WESLEY

-- Sees the Loom’s POWER BUTTON Across the room
BACK TO SHOT

And just as the darkness threatens to swallow him forever
Wesley WRAPS his foot around a mass of threads and KICKS

---sending a WAVE whipping down the length of gathered
threads to cross the room -- and HIT THE POWER BUTTON

Instantly the Loom STARTS UP and the web of threads LEAP UP
around them TANGLING Sloan in a net of tightening threads
and YANKING him into the air

Ironically the same actions that ensnare Sloan RELEASE
Wesley

ECU - WESLEYS THREADS

As they UNFURL around him Freeing him

WIDE ANGLE

As the two men switch places victim to victor Sloan
DANGLES at the edge of the GAPING HOLE in the floor tied
tight as a holiday roast Completely IMMOBILIZED

As Wesley approaches him the floor beneath the Loom CRACKS
threatening to give

Wesley doesn’t care Walks right up to Sloan --

AND PUNCHES HIM IN THE FACE

Sloan falls into the pit Falls TWENTYTHIRTY feet before
he’s JERKED TO A STOP a few feet above the floor by the web

of threads

As he dangles there the threads cutting painfully into his

skin Sloan SPOTS the gun Wesley dropped laying on the floor
only inches away He reaches for it but --
22307 104

WESLEY grabs two handfuls of threads and SLIDES down
REACHES the gun a heartbeat before Sloan does

Sloan sags in his cocoon his last chance gone

WESLEY
I never could play the guitar

Wesley raises his gun Sloan looks up directly into the
abyss of the barrel pointed at his head

WESLEY
This -- is my instrument

BOOM Wesley shoots Sloan
Sloan straightens in shock the full terrifying knowledge
that he is dying that everything is lost registering on his
face in those final seconds
But Wesley doesn’t wait to see the end This is how he wants
to remember Sloan Helpless Gasping like a fish out of
water Afraid
WESLEY

I know you stopped believing in

fate
Wesley turns and WALKS AWAY

Behind him Sloan fights for his last breath as the factory
starts to collapse around him

SLOAN’S HAND
snaps threads and draws a GUN from his pocket
ON THE FLOOR ABOVE

Sloan’s movements cause the Loom to start to shift The
boards beneath the Loom start to CREAK and SPLINTER

SLOAN
swings the gun around to aim at Wesley’s back Wesley HEARS

Sloan COCK the gun -- But Wesley doesn’t do anything He’s
fearless And just as Sloan goes to squeeze the trigger --

The floor above CAVES IN and the LOOM COMES CRASHING DOWN
Sloan’s scream of impotent rage is cut brutally short as his
body is SMASHED through the factory floor --

-- CRUSHED to nothingness by the Loom
22307 105

EXT FRATERNITY - NIGHT

Wesley is standing outside the ruins He knows what
happened

WESLEY
(to himself)
But I didn’t
REVEAL
He’s looking at the broken bloody and beaten-up FOX
WESLEY
Couldn’t help but notice your name was
absent in Sloan’s binder
FOX
I noticed that too
(beat)
Made it easier to side against him

WESLEY laughs She laughs They head out -- into the city

FOX
Now what

WESLEY
I’ve got some ideas

INT FRATERNITY RUINS - SAME TIME

FIND the Loom Charred and broken and still
When suddenly it comes to life

And the LASER begins to etch “WESLEY GIBS--”

--AND WE’RE OUT
