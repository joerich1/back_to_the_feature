ACT ONE
EXT MAIN QUAD MIDDLETON UNIVERSITY - NIGHT

FOOTBALL PLAYERS CHEERLEADERS A SEA OF SCREAMING RILED UP
COLLEGE STUDENTSbecause weve been thrust into the center of a
PEP RALLY for the MIDDLETON UNIVERSITY WARRIORS By day this
quad is filled with the best and brightest minds in the country --
future Rhodes Scholars and Nobel winners -- but right now Theyre
just drunk Spooky foreboding music sets the tone as we MOVE
SLOW MOTION over the crowd Even though its the middle of winter
the GUYS are SHIRTLESS showing off their pecs painted in school
colors while their GIRLFRIENDS sit on their shoulders chugging
from bottles of whiskey Its a wild rowdy debaucherous ORGY

of school pride that only Americas wealthiest children could get
away with The only person who could possibly get them to pay
attention right now is the FOOTBALL COACH shouting into a mic on
the stage a preacher with his disciples He holds a TORCH

FOOTBALL COACH
Its been a rough year no doubt
but that all ends Saturday Because
thats when this team my Warriors
are gonna burn those lazy cocky
pansy-ass Princeton players to the
ground AINT THAT RIGHT
MIDDLETON LET ME HEAR IT

As the crowd ROARS the coach now brings the torch to a TOWERING
WOODEN EFFIGY behind him the word Princeton painted across its
make-believe jersey And as the effigy BURSTS INTO FLAMES and
the MARCHING BAND LAUNCHES INTO SONG the camera suddenly speeds
up pushing through the students and over the bonfire and past
the gothic buildings and ivy-covered arches that make up this
beautiful campus until we CRASH INTO --

EXT WOODS - NIGHT

Its dark and eerie as we whip past the trees deeper and deeper
into the woods the sounds of the pep rally fading behind us
Suddenly the camera SCREECHES TO A HALT We are now in a small
CLEARING Through the dark we see 3 TWENTY-SOMETHINGS a diverse
motley crew shivering in the cold and freaking out About what
well soon discover The first of them MICHAELA PRATT (27
preppy type-A) paces and thinks as the two others sit quiet and
trembling She was born knowing how to lean in so thats what
shes going to do right now -- take control CEO this shit

MICHAELA
Its been too long We did what we
said we waited we stuck to our
word but we cant just sit here all
night We have to do something
And I know youre not going to like
it but Im calling Aiden
PATRICK
ARE YOU HIGH

Under normal circumstances PATRICK DONAHUE is sexy
sophisticated confident cool and hyper-articulate Right now
though Hes shitting his pants

PATRICK (CONTD)
Were not calling your fiancé We
wait THAT is what we decided so
THAT is what were going to do

MICHAELA
I was never part of that decision

PATRICK
Because you had a meltdown You
could barely make a sentence So
shut up sit down and stop acting
like a little bitch baby

MICHAELA
I am acting like a person does ina
situation like this

PATRICK
No Youre hysterical and you need
to calm the hell down

MICHAELA
DO NOT TELL ME HOW TO FEEL RIGHT
Now

WES (0OS)
Hey

They all jump SCREAMING BLOODY MURDER just like we do at home
because now a 4th person stands there Meet WES GIBBINS Wes is boyish easy-going instantly likableand his t-shirt is
covered in blood

WES (CONTD)
Sorry it took me so long I went
back for this

Wes removes a backpack pulls out a TROPHY also covered in blood

MICHAELA
Wes Whyd you bring that here
Take it back right now

LAUREL
No Its smart

Finally we hear from LAUREL WILDING (23 bookish introverted)
Shes been quiet up till now

Thats her thing -- shes a thinker an observer the type of person
easy to underestimate She has the answer now though decisive
confident

LAUREL (CONTD)
The People vs Gallivan Pennsylvania
vs Gottlieb Cases the prosecution
shouldve won but lost because there
was no murder weapon

PATRICK
So what are you saying

LAUREL
We clean it and put it back Hide
it in plain sight
(beat )
After we bury the body

A long beat as everyone takes that in Then --

MICHAELA
No absolutely NOT

PATRICK
I agree with Michaela

LAUREL
Patrick--

PATRICK
The trophy we need yes But the
body stays where it is

LAUREL
The body is what gets us caught

PATRICK
Then whyd we leave it there in the
first place

LAUREL
Because we panicked All of us
But now that were finally thinking
straight--

MICHAELA
You are not thinking straight--

LAUREL
Then what do you suggest

MICHAELA
Something that doesnt involve
carrying a body across campus on the
busiest night of the year
PATRICK
Shes right Laurel Even if we
were able to get it out of the house
unseen the ground is frozen--

LAUREL
We have all night to dig

PATRICK
You dont know what youre talking
about

LAUREL

This is murder none of us know what
were talking about

MICHAELA

Please just yell that a little louder--
WES

Hey
MICHAELA

Honestly youre all dumber than I
thought if you think we should go
back there

PATRICK
Im agreeing with you

Now everyones yelling except Wes who keeps trying to interrupt

MICHAELAPATRICKLAURELWES
You shouldve agreed with me weeks
ago when I begged BEGGED to tell
the police instead of deluding
ourselves that we were on the right
side of thisAnd Im sorry Laurel
but someone will sniff out the body
if we bury it if they dont catch
us before there are cops everywhere
tonightYou two need to MAN UP and
THINK because were going to jail
unless we go back there and destroy
the DNA GuysListenHeySHUT
UP

Finally they all stop look at Wes Hes calm focused a quiet
and confident leader to this very outspoken group

WES
Its two against two We have no
other choice We flip a coin

Beat
MICHAELAPATRICKLAUREL
That is the dumbest thing youve
ever said Im not letting a
freaking coin decide this Were
adults we can figure this out

WES
We dont have time to fight We
need to make a decision and commit
to it So if someone has a better
idea say it now

They all realize no one does Wes pulls a coin out of his pocket

WES (CONTD)
Heads we get the body Tails we
leave it where it is Okay

A beat then they all nod Okay And as Wes tosses the coin in
the air the four of them watching and freezing and totally totally
fucked we HOLD TIGHT ON WES AND CUT TO

EXT MAIN QUAD MIDDLETON UNIVERSITY - DAY - 4 MONTHS EARLIER

Wes the September sun on his face now rides his bike through
Middletons pristine manicured campus A CHYRON appears FOUR
MONTHS EARLIER He weaves his way past the fresh-faced
Abercrombie-clad undergrads playing frisbee on the green and
professors holding class under trees And just as we find
ourselves remembering our own college days and wishing we could
go back and to this idyllic campus in particular Wes stops his
bike in front of a beautiful historic building He looks up at
the letters etched into the stone MIDDLETON LAW SCHOOL Wes
takes in the sight his face full of so much hope and promise
that he doesnt notice the BULLETIN BOARD he passes on his way
inside Stapled across every inch of its surface is the same
FLIER -- it shows a PHOTO of missing student LILA STANGARD (21
all-American) printed with the words Have you seen me As we
HOLD ON this eerie haunting image a mystery about to unfold

INT LECTURE HALL - DAY

Wes enters through the back of this old-fashioned lecture hall
filled with 80 OF THE MOST BRILLIANT LAW STUDENTS IN AMERICA As
he makes his way to the front of the room smiling at people way
too friendly we hear snippets of different conversations but
all of them about the same exact person

NERVOUS GIRL
I threw up four times this morning
worried shes gonna call on me

DOUCHEFACE
Shes a ballbuster sure but I spent
my summer interning for Justice
(MORE )
DOUCHEFACE (CONTD)
Roberts I know how to handle a big
personality

NERDY INTELLECTUAL
Dershowitz has the upper hand in the
academic world but I think DeWitts
clearly the better defense attorney

Wes reaches the front row taking a seat next to a person we do
not yet see He takes a deep breath

WES
Here we go Im not usually a first
row kinda guy but I promised myself
I wouldnt hide in the back of the
class on the first day--

MICHAELA
Im engaged

And now we REVEAL MICHAELA in the next seat She wears a tasteful
sweater set and a GIANT DIAMOND RING which she now holds out for
Wes to see He realizes what shes thinking

WES
Oh Oh no I wasnt hitting on
Thats not Youre attractive
yes but--

MICHAELA

Seats are assigned Theres a chart
over there

Michaela goes back to meticulously high-lighting her already tabbed
TEXTBOOK Wes now mortified quickly hurries off passing--

PATRICK
Nice try player

Patricks all suave and dapper in a tie not a hair out of place

WES
No I wasnt

PATRICK
You should go find your seat You
dont wanna be a sitting duck when
the Shooter gets here

WES
Who
PATRICK
(amused)
Oh my god You have no idea what
you just walked into

But before Wes can ask what he means the ROOM SUDDENLY GOES QUIET
as PROFESSOR ANNALISE DEWITT (40s) enters Annalise is everything
you hope your law professor will be -- brilliant passionate
creative charismatic Shes also everything you dont expect --
sexy elegant glamorous dangerous Without a word or wasted
motion a shark through water she moves to the front of the room

ANNALISE
Good morning I dont know what
terrible things youve all done up
to this point in your lives but
clearly your karmas out of balance
to get assigned to my class That
said here we all are Im Professor
Annalise DeWitt and this is Criminal
Law 100 Or as I prefer to call it --

She picks up a RED MARKER and writes on the board the students
all watching twisting their necks to see the words Finally she
finishes turning to them as she reads the words aloud

ANNALISE (CONTD)
How to get away with murder

And as the students sit forward in their seats some amused some
scared but all of them THRILLED beyond belief we HOLD ON the
words shes written on the board Which is also our

TITLE CARD
INT LECTURE HALL - MOMENTS LATER

Annalise jumps into her lecture commanding the room Patton before
his troops

ANNALISE

Many of you brought your textbook
Dont bother Not because you wont
be tested on its content -- you will --
but because thats material youll
need to learn on your own time
Because this lecture Is my time
And unlike many of my colleagues I
will NOT be teaching you how to study
the law or theorize about it but
rather how to practice it Ina
courtroom Like a real lawyer

(beat )
Now to our first case study a past
client of mine known as the Aspirin
Assassin

Everyone takes out a copy of a CASE STUDY PACKET Everyone except
Wes whos just looking around lost no idea whats going on

But before he can ask anyone for help Annalise starts a power-
point a PHOTO of GINA SADOWSKI (30s peroxide blonde trashy
sexy) now popping up on the screen

ANNALISE (CONTD)
Tell us the facts of the case

Annalise looks to her seating chart everyone shifting nervously
before she comes upon a name

ANNALISE (CONTD)
Patrick Donahue

Patrick stands -- effortless and confident

PATRICK
The People vs Gina Sadowski was a
case of attempted murder The
defendant Ms Sadowski worked as
the Second Assistant to the victim
Arthur Levinson who was the CEO of
an advertising agency

Annalise changes the slide a PHOTO of ARTHUR LEVINSON (50s
distinguished) popping up Note New slides will appear
throughout this scene as we introduce new information -- photos
of people theyre discussing evidence etc

PATRICK (CONTD)

Ms Sadowski was not only Mr
Levinsons assistant though She
was also his mistress

ANNALISE
What happened after Mr Levinsons
wife of 27 years Agnes discovered
the affair
(seating chart)
Asher Millstone

DOUCHEFACE (20s pompous uber-prepared) stands

DOUCHEFACE
Mr Levinson ended the relationship
with the defendant and transferred
her to the accounting department
But on her last day working for him
she allegedly swapped one of his
blood pressure pills for an aspirin --
which she knew he was allergic to

ANNALISE
What occurred when Mr Levinson
ingested the aspirin Anyone
HANDS SHOOT UP but Michaela beats them all by simply standing

MICHAELA

Mr Levinson went into anaphylactic
shock His throat swelled and his
brain was deprived of oxygen for the
7 minutes it took his First Assistant
to find him

(then)
Michaela Pratt

Michaela smiles and sits -- thats how its done bitches And
throughout all of this Wes is looking around sweating shocked
that his classmates are able to answer these questions

ANNALISE
Weve established the actus reus
but what was the mens rea Wesley
Gibbins

Wes winces Fuck He stands Nervous

WES
The mens rea Right Um

Wes opens his textbook starts to flip through it

ANNALISE
Day 1 and youre unprepared

WES
No Well yes but I didnt
know there was anything to prepare

ANNALISE
I emailed this assignment to the
entire class two days ago

WES
Oh Thats why I didnt get that

A beat Annalise taking in the sight of him Hungry

ANNALISE
Mr Gibbins as a defense attorney I
spend most of my time around
professional liars so youre going
to have to work a little harder to
pull one over on me

WES
Im notits just
(biting the bullet)
I only got accepted here two days
ago From the waitlist So thats
probably why you didnt get my email

Some uncomfortable chuckles Doucheface in particular getting a
kick We feel terrible for Wes but Annalise presses on

ANNALISE
Let me help you out Actus reus
means guilty act -- the poisoning
of Mr Levinson with an aspirin in
this case -- whereas mens rea means
guilty mind So what do you think
was Ms Sadowskis mens rea

Wes just stares at her No clue what she just said

ANNALISE (CONTD)
Think Mr Gibbins This is nothing
more than common sense

But Wes cant think his mind now only focused on the fact that
everyone is staring at him and his utter horrifying embarrassment
when suddenly we hear

LAUREL (0S)
To kill

Annalise stops turning to the class

ANNALISE
Will the individual who just spoke
please stand and repeat their answer

Out of the abyss of students a hidden unnoticed LAUREL rises
She is meek tentative shydifferent than the decisive
argumentative girl we met in the woods

LAUREL
The mens rea also referred to as
intent was to kill Mr Levinson
She didnt of course which is why
this was an attempted murder case
and not first degree murder

ANNALISE
Thats right Your name

LAUREL
Laurel Wilding

And just like a switch was flipped from to zero to pissed--

ANNALISE
Dont ever take a learning opportunity
away from another student Ms
Wilding No matter how smart we
need everyone to think we are

Ouch Laurel sits mortified as Annalise continues

ANNALISE (CONTD)
Now who can tell me what verdict the
jury came to on the case

A beat as everyone starts to flip through the packets

ANNALISE (CONTD)
None of you know Which makes sense
Because I lied This is not a past
case but one I go to trial on in two
days Thats right Gina is my
client And now your client too

Off the students stunned excited faces we CUT TO
EXT ANNALISES HOUSEOFFICE —- DAY

Were outside a quaint two-story Victorian right on the edge of
campus A WOODEN SIGN sits out front -- THE LAW OFFICE OF
ANNALISE DEWITT CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY And now as we get
closer we see that STUDENTS pour out the door

GINA (PRE-LAP)
Every day before lunch it was the
same thing

INT LIVING ROOM ANNALISES HOUSEOFFICE - CONTINUOUS

CLOSE ON GINA SADOWSKI now telling her story her nervous voice
shaking through her thick Philly accent

GINA
I had to put a blood pressure pill
on the plate next to his keyboard so
hed remember to take it

We now REVERSE ANGLE to see ALL THE STUDENTS gathered in the packed
living room -- people on the floor pushed against the wall
overflowing into the foyer Wes watches on the edge of his seat

GINA (CONTD)
And this one day I had been working
there a few weeks at that point I
walked into his office to put the
pill there when I screamed Because
Arthur was there Back early from
his lunch meeting And when I say
screamed I mean it was something
out of a horror movie I was like
crap hes gonna fire me -- Arthur
was a real ball busta to work for --
but instead he just started laughin
So then I started laughin

(MORE )
As Gina looks down embarrassed Doucheface whispers to Laurel

Laurel just glares at him offended as Gina continues

And now Ginas all tears

her story

Gina nods and heads to the bathroom

GINA (CONTD)
That real hard hurts-your-belly

kind andwell I guess I really saw
him then As a man and not some big

ad exec jerk And then well he
kissed me andyeah I became that
girl

DOUCHEFACE
Something tells me shes always been
that girl

GINA

We went on like that for a few months

until this one day when Agnes his
wife she came in the office I
could tell the minute she met me --
she knew I wasnt surprised when
he told me he was moving me to
accounting They have kids and I
was just some bimbo secretary I
told myself to just be happy they
werent firing me It was on my
last day working for him when I was
coming back from lunch and saw the
ambulance outside the building
When I heard why they were there
that Arthur was hurt

(tearing up emotional)
I loved him I know thats hard to
believe but I loved him why in
the hell would I want to hurt him

ANNALISE

Its okay if you need a little break

ANNALISE (CONTD)
Gina only became my client 2 days
ago You havent heard of her case
yet because her previous lawyer was
bad and had no clue had how to work
the media Which brings me to the

question youre all asking yourselves

Why are you here One because
the dean doesnt like me using

university space for my private work

(MORE )

Once shes gone

As are many of the students moved by
Annalise puts a comforting hand on Gina

ANNALISE (CONTD)
And two because your first assignment
is to help me win this trial

As the students take this in confused excited scared

ANNALISE (CONTD)
Tomorrow each of you will have one
minute to present what you believe
is the best defense for Gina I
have my own strategy of course but
see if you can beat my approach
come up with something better --
Mr Gibbins

WES
(startling)
Yes

ANNALISE
A serious student wouldve checked
with me about any prep-work no matter
the timing of their acceptance so
youll go last -- an unenviable
position since no two students will
be able to present the same idea

As Wes takes this in totally fucked

ANNALISE (CONTD)
Use the resources in this office --
Ginas discovery file my library
the people who understand me even
better than myself -- my associates
Bonnie and Frank Guys

From the back of the room we spot FRANK DELGADO and BONNIE
WINTERBOTTOM (40s) Frank is a macho takes-no-shit type of guy --

a local Philly boy done good -- while Bonnie is his perfect
counterpoint -- a mama bear type warm and sweet and smiley
FRANK

Names Frank and unlike every teacher
youve had I do believe there are
stupid questions So if you got

‘em please see my lovely colleague
Bonnie

BONNIE
Or better come to us with answers
Well like you much better that way

As the students stand gathering their things--

ANNALISE
One more thing Every year I choose
4 students to come work at the firm
Ill be using this assignment to
decide who that will be And the
top student Gets this

Annalise pulls a TROPHY off the bookshelf the trophy we recognize
from that first scene in the woods

ANNALISE (CONTD)
Consider it your immunity idol
Whoever wins it can turn it back in
at any point to get out of an
assignment or exam Now get to work

And as the students all jump into action--
INT WESS APARTMENT - NIGHT

Wes works alone in this rundown off campus apartment An air
mattress sits on the floor unpacked boxes piled everywhere He
paces talking to himself as he reads from Ginas DISCOVERY FILE

WES

The First Assistant saw Gina with an
aspirin that morning Forensics
found aspirin residue on the plate
She was warned about his allergy the
first day on the job which means we
should arguewe should arguewe
should arguethat shes guilty

He collapses on the bed fucked no ideas But suddenly he
squints noticing something He sits up peering closer at -- a
SERIES OF SCRATCH-MARKS etched into the wall Scratch marks that
look a lot like a crazy person took their fingernails to it And
as he sits there staring at this creepy strange image

MUSIC BLARES through the wall - hip hop or something with lots of
bass and anger As he stares at the vibrating wall HARD CUT TO

INT HALLWAY WESS APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER

Wes POUNDS on the neighbors door Finally it opens a crack
revealing REBECCA (22 edgy pierced) We only get a glimpse but
can immediately see that theres a haunted vulnerable quality
about her Wes shouts over the music

WES
Hi Wes I just moved in next door--
Are you okay

He stops because he now sees that shes been crying her eyes
red and puffy

REBECCA
What do you want

Shes short impatient So much for a neighborly welcome

WES
Your music I normally wouldnt ask
to turn it down but today was my
first day of law school and I have
this big assignment --

REBECCA
No

WES
What

REBECCA

The last guy who lived in your place
was a law student I put up with
his crazy loud rabbit sex and nervous
breakdown you can deal with this

She shuts the door in his face And then turns the music even
LOUDER As Wes stands there hating his new life

INT LIVING ROOM ANNALISES HOUSEOFFICE - NIGHT 10

Bonnie and Frank work on Ginas case -- piles of papers and Chinese
take-out spread across the Persian Rug on the floor But right

now their attention is on the LIVE NEWS CONFERENCE playing on TV
Outside a police station a very emotional STUART and MIRANDA
STANGARD (50s) speak to a bank of reporters Football hero LOGAN
OREILLY (22 square-jawed built like an ox) stands beside them
holding a PHOTO of the MISSING GIRL FROM THE FLIERS LILA The
scroll reads Missing Middleton girls parents speak out

STUART STANBURG (ON TV)
To the person or persons who have
taken our daughter please tell us
your demands And to Lila sweetie
if youre watching know we love
you All of us - your mother and I
your sisters Logan--

BONNIE
How have they not arrested that fiancé
yet Look at him hes a giant rage
ball of testosterone and steroids

FRANK
Hes the hopes and dreams of an entire
football season No ones arresting
him unless they find her body in his
trunk

ANNALISE (0S)
Who wrote this opening statement

They startle a stern Annalise now standing there as she shuts
off the TV and throws some files down on the coffee table

FRANK
I did

ANNALISE

I hate it Start over Bonnie no
more burying my desk in precedents
We need to appeal to the jurys
emotions not their brains

(then)
We have 36 hours I dont care if it
means staying here all night we can
do better than what we have right
now

They nod good little schoolchildren as Annalise leaves Frank
quickly dials his cell phone Bonnie noticing

BONNIE
The philosophy major

FRANK
The gymnast Shes new
(into phone)
Lacey hey I need to reschedule

And as Frank steps out he knocks a Chinese container over food
now spilling all over the rug And Bonnie

BONNIE
Frank

And as we HOLD ON the NOW STAINED RUG and FLASH FORWARD TO --
INT LIVING ROOM ANNALISES HOUSEOFFICE - NIGHT - FLASH FORWARD

That same rug now being rolled up by Wes and Patrick Because we
are now back to that night in the woods And although we dont
know who it is yet we can tell there is now a BODY in the rug
(Note These flash-forward scenes will be shot in some cool
grainy visual style different than the rest of our show)

PATRICK
Michaela--

Michaela snaps from the other side of the room her back to them
MICHAELA

I never agreed to this
(MORE )

MICHAELA (CONTD)
The coin did so Im going to stand
here and not see anything so when
Im called to testify I can say
just that

PATRICK
I understand freak-show I just
want you to move your feet

Michaela realizes shes standing on the rug So she steps aside
They finish rolling it up as a Laurel enters holding the now clean
shiny trophy in a clear zip-lock bag She hands it to Wes

LAUREL
Here I wiped the sink down with
bleach after I washed it

WES
Well put it back tomorrow the cops
wont ever know it was the weapon

PATRICK
Can we hurry up here

Wes puts the trophy in his backpack (leaving us wondering who had
the trophy at the time of the murder) then goes to help Patrick
lift the rugwhich is too fucking heavy Laurel jumps in

LAUREL
Let me

Still the 3 of them arent strong enough They look to Michaela

MICHAELA
Fine
And now the four of them lift the rug off the floor struggling
to carry it into the foyer bumping into crap as they go Finally
they reach the wooden front door Wes turns to them They all
nod -- do it So Wes now opens the door to REVEAL --

A CAMPUS COP standing next to a double-parked SUV its hazard
lights flashing The cop looks up at them all friendly

CAMPUS COP
This car one of yours

And as they all stand there absolutely fucked we --

END ACT ONE

ACT TWO
EXT ANNALISES HOUSEOFFICE - NIGHT - FLASH FORWARD 12
Where we left off the Cop waiting for an answer A long beat--

PATRICK
Its my car sir

CAMPUS COP
Youre double parked You might get
a ticket with all the city cops out
tonight

PATRICK
(phew)
Oh Right Ill move it now

But before Patrick can the Cop stops now noticing the rug theyve
now lowered to the ground and stepped in front of duh

CAMPUS COP
This is that law professors office

A beat each of them hoping the other will do the talking until --

MICHAELA
Yes Professor DeWitt Were her
law students but shes out of town
and she told us to take this old rug
to the bonfire

CAMPUS COP
She asked you to go into her house
and burn a rug for her

MICHAELA
It sounds weird I know Why dont
I get her on the phone for you so
she can explain

Michaela digs out her phone as Laurel steps forward glaring --
what the fuck does she think shes doing

LAUREL
Its a little late to call her dont
you think

MICHAELA

The nice officer here thinks were
burgling our professors house lets
just clear this up
(then to the cop)
I mean unless youd rather me not
(MORE )

MICHAELA (CONTD)
She had to go to this funeral today
her mothers funeral but shes
probably not asleep yet Hopefully

CAMPUS COP
Its fine Just--

DRUNK DUDE (0S)
Hey you guys

Down the street a DRUNK COLLEGE STUDENT carries a GIANT REINDEER
LAWN ORNAMENT as he runs to catch up to some friends

DRUNK DUDE (CONTD)
This1l burn good

CAMPUS COP
God dammit
(then to our students)
Be safe okay There are ton of
crazies out tonight

The Cop rushes to regulate on the drunk kids Patrick turns to
Michaela impressed

PATRICK
Where the hell has that girl been
all night

MICHAELA

Can we just get this over with

And now Michaela goes to pick up the rug straining to lift it as
we HOLD ON HER DETERMINED FACE AND FLASHBACK TO --

INT LECTURE HALL - DAY - 4 MONTHS EARLIER

Michaela 4 months earlier articulate and poised as she presents
her defense strategy for Gina before the class Annalise Frank
and Bonnie are there taking notes as our students -- including
Wes Laurel and Patrick watch with jealous rage

MICHAELA
We should offer the jury another
suspect altogether -- Mr Levinsons

wife Agnes She was angry about
the affair had access to his office
and knew what aspirin would look
like his blood pressure pill So
what better way to get revenge than
to kill your cheating husband and
pin it on his mistress Thank you

Michaela stops proud and confident just as an EGG TIMER GOES OFF --

right on time

Annalise Bonnie and Frank whisper to each other for a moment before
Annalise turns back to Michaela

ANNALISE
Take a seat Ms Pratt Youve made
it to the next round

Michaela beams then sits Wes crosses Pin it on someone else
off his list of POSSIBLE DEFENSE STRATEGIES

ANNALISE (CONTD)
Whos next

And as all the HANDS SHOOT UP we BEGIN A SEQUENCE of the students
presenting their ideas INTERCUTTING between them in a fast
stylized energetic way First up a casual-yet-self-assured--

PATRICK
Yes Gina put the aspirin on the
plate on his desk but did she have
the intent to kill Or was her intent
to simply harm Mr Levinson

ENGLISH ACCENT GIRL speaks fast and furious--

ENGLISH ACCENT GIRL
Gina didnt realize it was an aspirin
but actually thought it was the blood
pressure medication which thus makes
Mr Levinsons near death an accident
so therefore there was no mens rea

Doucheface talks like hes Perry Mason in front of the jury

DOUCHEFACE
It all comes down to a simple piece
of evidence -- the fact that doctors

ran Mr Levinsons bloodwork too
late to show aspirin in his blood

Laurel presents a graph

LAUREL
A statistical breakdown of the jury
pool shows 80 percent of them come
from a low socioeconomic class

PATRICK
Gina knew her boss was allergic to
aspirin but she did not know he could
die from it She simply wanted to
give him a scare

NERVOUS STUTTERING STUDENT
So without a witness to assure that
uh sorry I think I lost my spot

LAUREL
We use this inequality to our
advantage and present this case to
the jury as a class struggle

MONOTONE QUIET GUY
The issues at play are in need of
more extensive research so my
recommendation is to delay

DOUCHEFACE
Yes the doctors on record saying
that he didnt run the bloodwork on
time but do we really trust him

NERVOUS STUDENT
I swear Ill find it Just one
more second

PATRICK
Attempted murder therefore is a
bogus inaccurate charge The judge
will have no other choice but to
direct the jury to an NG verdict

LAUREL
Gina is one of them -- the put upon
and under-appreciated -- while Mr

Levinson represents the wealthy and
out of touch Thank you

Laurel stops waits for her fate

ANNALISE
You can sit

As Laurel sits relieved we now see that most seats are empty --
the majority of students disqualified now at the front of the
class sitting on the floor leaning against the wall Only about
20 students remain including Patrick Michaela Laurel English
Accent Girl Doucheface and Wes -- who is now looking down at

his LIST OF STRATEGIES every single idea crossed out

ANNALISE (CONTD)
And now our last victim Mr Gibbins

Wes takes a deep breath then stands Annalise presses the timer

WES
So um the way I see it iswell
Theres really only one option
(then out of nowhere)
We say it was self defense
(MORE )
WES (CONTD)

(some chuckles )
I know its weird to enter a guilty
plea now the day before the trial
but its my belief that at the time
of the crime Gina was suffering
fromStockholm Syndrome

(more laughs)
Which is actually quite common in
assistants with demanding bosses
The affair for example is just one
example of how far Mr Levinsons
brainwashing of Gina went -- he made
her fall in love with him So in
this way her poisoning him was
actually just an act of self defense
And Ill just go stand over there

Wes goes to join the disqualified students when --

ANNALISE
No Sit

As we hold on the classs utter shock Wes included --

ANNALISE (CONTD)
Congratulations to all of you still
seated Youll be joining us for
the next round in court tomorrow
That said not one of you presented
an idea I can use in court so my
plan wins Step l

(writing on the board)
We discredit the witnesses Find
the holes in their stories attack
their character Step 2 we introduce
a new suspect That person is not
Mr Levinsons wife Ms Pratt but
rather his business partner Lionel
Brandt Step 3 we bury the evidence
by throwing so much information at
the jury theyll walk into the
deliberation room with one
overwhelming feeling -- doubt
(recapping)
Destroy witnesses Find a new
suspect Overwhelm the jury That
is how you get away with murder
Or in this case attempted murder
Meet me at the courthouse at 9
tomorrow to present your ideas thatll
work with this strategy

As Annalise starts to go Michaela stands

MICHAELA
Professor DeWitt We have torts at
9 tomorrow then contracts property--

ANNALISE
Youre free to drop out of the
competition at any point Ms Pratt

MICHAELA
No its not that I just wasnt
sure how we were supposed to--

ANNALISE
(interrupting fierce)
The way youre whining to me right
now it feels like you think Im
your mother Im not Show up
tomorrow or dont Its that simple

Annalise struts off Bonnie and Frank following As we go off a
bitch-slapped Michaela her classmates all gleefully watching

EXT PHILADELPHIA COURTHOUSE - DAY 14
Phillys criminal courthouse

LINDA WHEELER (PRE-LAP)
So I just kept pumping his chest

INT COURTROOM - DAY 15

Annalise Frank Bonnie and Gina sit at the defense table as
PROSECUTOR HANK BALDWIN (50s by the book) questions witness LINDA
WHEELER (50s cat lady type) Lindas tearful as she recounts

the events of that day We also notice she wears THICK COKE-
BOTTLE GLASSES JUDGE KATHY POWELL (50s) presides

LINDA WHEELER

Just like in our company CPR class
But it didnt work He wasnt
breathing and his skinwell it
just kept getting more blue and--

(crying harder)
Im so sorry Agnes I tried everything
I could think of

Shes talking to AGNES LEVINSON (50s) wife of ARTHUR LEVINSON
both of whom we now see sitting behind the prosecution Agnes

nods a sweet thank you to Linda while Arthur does nothing at all
Because now we see -- Arthur is in a wheelchair his mental
faculties not all there as a NURSE monitors his breathing machine
On the other side of the courtroom we find our 20 STUDENTS (except
Michaela) Patrick mutters to Wes

PATRICK
And we just lost the case

Back to the stand the prosecutor feigns sympathy

PROSECUTOR BALDWIN
You did everything you couldve
Miss Wheeler

He sits Now Annalise stands walks to Linda A shark to blood
Watching her in action is riveting thrilling

ANNALISE
You dont like my client do you
Miss Wheeler

LINDA WHEELER
What

ANNALISE
Sometimes youd yell at her throw
things call her
(reading from a list)
Incompetent stupid trailer
trash

And now the jury looks to Gina sympathetically

LINDA WHEELER
No Thats I mean working for
someone as important as Mr Levinson
can be stressful Tempers flare

ANNALISE
So youre admitting you have a temper

As Annalise continues her attack Michaela now rushes in out of
breath as she runs up to the defense table whispering loudly to
Bonnie and Frank so that everyone in the courtroom is now
distracted Wes Patrick and Laurel watch confused

PATRICK
What is she doing

ANNALISE
Your honor can I have a moment
(to Michaela pissed)
What the hell

FRANK
(to Michaela)
Its all you girlfriend

As Michaela is about to explain we cut back to our students
PATRICK

Shes lost it right The first of
us to have a nervous breakdown

WES
I was sure itd be me

LAUREL
It still might be Look

They sees what she means Annalise now looking at Michaela with
interest Back to them --

ANNALISE
How sure are you

MICHAELA
90 percent
(off Annalises stare)

As Annalise looks at her wondering whether to trust her

PROSECUTOR BALDWIN
Your honor I dont know what this
stalling is about but --

ANNALISE
Sorry for the delay

Michaela takes a seat next to Laurel Patrick whispering to her
from the row behind

PATRICK
What was that Something you learned
in torts

MICHAELA
Something that just won me the trophy

As Patrick wonders what she means Annalise continues her cross

ANNALISE
Miss Wheeler you testified that you
saw a pill on my clients desk the
day of the accident correct

GINA
Yes

ANNALISE
You said it was a yellow pill similar
to the color of Prosecutor Baldwins
shirt perhaps

GINA
Yes

And now the entire room stops because Prosecutor Baldwins shirt
is not yellow but blue Annalise steps closer to Miss Wheeler

ANNALISE
Mr Baldwins shirt is blue Miss
Wheeler
(then softer)
Are you color blind

As Linda shrinks in her seat

LINDA WHEELER
Yes

And now we hold on Michaela who smiles victoriously the other
students now clocking this not sure how she knew this

ANNALISE
I see So whether the pill you saw
on my clients desk was blue like
her similarly shaped anxiety
medication she took because of the
stress endured while working with
you or yellow like the aspirin
used to poison Mr Levinson is not
something you can tell us

LINDA WHEELER
I told you Gina was acting very
strange that morning Nervous

ANNALISE
Its a simple question Miss Wheeler
Is it possible the pill you saw on

Ginas desk was her anti-anxiety
medication

LINDA WHEELER
---I guess so Yes

ANNALISE
Thank you for your candor

A victorious Annalise sits at the table as Gina turns to Bonnie

GINA
That was good right

BONNIE
No That was excellent

Off a relieved smiling Gina
INT LIVING ROOM ANNALISES HOUSEOFFICE - NIGHT

A gloating Michaela explains her discovery as Annalise Frank
Bonnie and our 20 students listen A jealous Patrick seethes

MICHAELA

I looked up her Facebook profile and
saw those crazy glasses which got
me wondering about her eyesight so
then I called every optometrist
covered under her insurance When I
found hers I pretended to be a claims
provider and got the receptionist to
tell me that Miss Wheeler has a
condition called achromatopsia It
causes color blindness

(then)
Step 1 Discredit the witness

She stops beaming everyone hating her Annalise stands
ANNALISE

WES

PATRICK
(crushing off)

WES

PATRICK

Not because I think youre a moron

doesnt allow for a 3rd wheel Later

As Patrick runs off Wes wondering what hes up to
INT WESS APARTMENT - NIGHT 18

The apartments FILLED WITH LAW BOOKS the walls covered with
PAPERS ABOUT GINAS CASE Wes stands there reading with TISSUES
STICKING OUT OF HIS EARS to block the sound of REBECCAS MUSIC
BLARING FROM NEXT DOOR We get QUICK SHOTS of him flipping through
books drinking coffee going over Ginas file circling
phraseswhen he suddenly stops Digs up a paper Cross
references it with a book Holy shit Hes found something He
jumps up grabbing his bike and rushing out of his apartment

EXT MAIN QUAD MIDDLETON UNIVERSITY - NIGHT 19

Wes rides his bike through an arch and SCREECHES TO A HALT Because

a VIGIL for Lila Fiancé Logan speaks to the crowd from a stage

LOGAN
If Lila was here I know shed want
to thank everyone for their support

LOGAN (CONTD)

Logan chokes up his teammates now all patting him on the back
and escorting him away 3 SORORITY GIRLS approach the mic

SORORITY GIRL
This is for Lila

They start to SING Something overwrought and funny like Demi
Lovatos Skyscraper Wes watches the students sway and cry
finding this all very strange then pushes his way through them

WES
Excuse me Sorry Excuse me

EXTINT ANNALISES HOUSEOFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

A now breathless Wes dumps his bike on the lawn and runs to the
front door which he finds ajar He enters -- its quiet empty

WES
Hello

No answer He moves into the house looks in the study living
room No one home But there -- he sees a light on in Annalises
office some voices and laughter inside He walks over to the
office door which is slightly open so he can see Annalise her
back to him as she sits on the desk Wes knocks

WES (CONTD)
Professor DeWitt--

And the slight pressure of his knock now makes the door slide
open enough so Wes now can now see a NAKED MAN NOW POP UP FROM
BELOW THE DESK Annalise jumps up quickly pulling down her skirt

WES (CONTD)
Oh my god

NAKED MAN
Get the hell out

Wes turns racing out of the office and back to the front door

ANNALISE
Hey Stop

Annalise eerily calm heads down the foyer stopping him

WES
Im so sorry The door was open and--

ANNALISE
Oh my god Ill kill him

A now annoyed Annalise heads over to a desk dials the phone As
it rings she looks to Wes who really just wants to leave

She hangs up

ANNALISE (CONTD)
So why are you here

WES
Oh That It can wait--

ANNALISE
Clearly it cant if you barged in

(into the phone)
Frank You didnt lock up Again

looks to Wes

ANNALISE (CONTD)

Speak

WES
Right um I came across this case --
Commonwealth vs McGinnis -- which

says we can motion for a faster
verdict if we think the prosecutions
evidence is insufficient--

ANNALISE
A directed verdict
WES
Huh
ANNALISE

What youre suggesting is called a
directed verdict If we ask for
one and get denied all the jury
will hear is that the judge thinks
theres enough evidence to convict

WES

But you discredited the first
assistants testimony today and--

ANNALISE

You had an idea Im telling you it
was a bad one Good night Seth

WES
Wes

ANNALISE
Right

And now Annalise pushes him out the door

END OF ACT TWO

Off a mortified Wes --

ACT THREE
EXT CONVENIENCE STORE - NIGHT - FLASH FORWARD
That night in the woods Patricks SUV now idles outside a 7-11
INT PATRICKS SUV - CONTINUOUS

Its eerily quiet a nice respite from the panic of the previous
scenes as Patrick sits in the drivers seat Michaela and Laurel
in the back Wes isnt there but the body is rolled up in the

rug thats now shoved in the back Laurel rolls down her window

PATRICK
What the hell are you doing Its
the middle of winter we cant be
riding around with the windows down

LAUREL
I cant take the smell

PATRICK
You shouldve thought of that before
you had the genius idea to move the
body

LAUREL
Youre not seriously still questioning
that decision

PATRICK
Oh I think Ill be questioning it
for the rest of my life In jail

MICHAELA
Wow now whos the one who needs to
calm down

PATRICK
Shut up

Suddenly the car door opens Wes wearing a hoody pulled up over
his head for cover climbs in with a six pack of beer and a bag
full of contents we cant yet see Patrick nods to it

PATRICK (CONTD)
Did you get it all

WES
Yup Beer too in case they got me
on the surveillance video

PATRICK
Dont worry well just kill the
store owner if we need to
(MORE )

PATRICK (CONTD)
(beat)
That was a joke You do all know
that

But they all just stay silent too traumatized for jokes right
now As we HOLD ON Patrick driving them out of the parking lot
wondering how the hell he ended up here we FLASHBACK TO

INT UPSCALE BAR - NIGHT - 4 MONTHS EARLIER
Four months earlier where a calmer cooler sexier Patrick carries

two drinks through a crowd of business-y types He arrives at a
table occupied by OLIVER (30 glasses nerdy cute)

PATRICK
Makers Manhattan 2 cherries

OLIVER
Im getting the next round otherwise
I refuse to drink this

PATRICK
Deal -- So you know your co-
workers over there seem to want a
show so say the word and we can start
making out

Oliver turns to see what Patrick means -- several of Olivers
BUSINESS-CASUAL-CLAD co-workers stealing glances at them

OLIVER
Ignore them I just dont talk to
guys at bars that often

PATRICK
I can tell

OLIVER
And now Im leaving

PATRICK
No youre not

OLIVER
No Im not

They both smile the chemistry fun and easy
PATRICK
So let me guess you all work in

that advertising agency upstairs

OLIVER
Is it that obvious

PATRICK
I work in the bank across the street
and the only hot guys who come here
are from your agency

OLIVER
Hot wow I dont think Ive ever
actually been called that But I
dont work in the cool part of the
company if thats what youre
thinking Im in IT

Ding Patricks just hit the jackpot

PATRICK
IT No I think ITs very cool

OLIVER
No you think ITs very dorky as
does the rest of the world

PATRICK
Maybe But dorks are actually my

type

Oliver looks up Patrick now giving him some serious sex-eye
And now Patrick goes in for the kill

PATRICK (CONTD)
Can I ask you something Did you
know that secretary who tried to
kill her boss with an aspirin

OLIVER
Yeah But Im not supposed to talk
about that actually The legal
department warned us as soon as the
media got ahold of the story a few
days ago

PATRICK
Oh Right Sorry I asked

And now Patrick looks down checking his phone no longer
interested Oliver realizes hes screwed up here especially
when Patrick now checks out another guy passing by

OLIVER
Okay Ill tell you a little bit
But you have to promise -- you didnt

hear this from me

As Patrick smiles an oblivious Oliver falling into his trap

24 INT HALLWAY WESS APARTMENT - NIGHT 24

Wes walks his bike down the hall when he hears an ARGUMENT inside
Rebeccas apartment The voices are muffled but angry--

MAN
YOU CANT JUST IGNORE-- NO- THATS
YOUR PROBLEM--—

REBECCA
STOP YELLING-- THIS ISNT ABOUT--

MAN
ITS ABOUT THE BOTH OF US

Suddenly theres a loud CRASH glass shattering inside Wes steps
to the door wanting to help when -- THE DOOR OPENS a MAN IN A
BASEBALL CAP almost slamming into Wes

WES
Hey
LOGAN
Hey
And now Wes realizes -- this man is none other than LOGAN OREILLY

Lilas football player fiancé (And if we need to we can flash
back to shots of the vigil to remind us who he is) Logan moves
past Wes and into the stairwell Wes looks back to Rebecca now
picking up broken pieces of a lamp He steps into the doorway

WES
Hey Do you need help
REBECCA
Its fine
WES

Here its not a big deal
Wes is about to help clean when Rebecca just snaps
REBECCA
I said its fine So go Get out
of my apartment
Wes stops And even though her words say one thing the look on
her face the way her hands are shaking say something different

He wants to stay there help but instead he says --

WES
Got it

He gets up and leaves Off Rebecca still shaking

INT COURTROOM - MORNING 25
Annalise is reading over a PRINTED OUT EMAIL

ANNALISE
Howd you get this

Now we REVERSE ANGLE to find Patrick pure confidence

PATRICK
Im not sure you really wanna know

And as Annalise looks at him intrigued we FLASHBACK TO
INT OLIVERS APARTMENT - THE NIGHT BEFORE 26

Patrick and Oliver are home from the bar and in full on make-out
mode pulling off their shirts and pants Suddenly Oliver stops

OLIVER
I have a confession I thought all
you wanted from me were those emails

PATRICK
I did But I want this too

And as Patrick pushes Oliver back on the bed we CUT BACK TO
INT COURTROOM - DAY 27
Back to Annalise and Patrick
PATRICK
Point is it wasnt exactly legal

which I know means you cant use it
as evidence

ANNALISE
No That just means we have to get
creative -- Bonnie

As Patrick watches Annalise go talk to Bonnie wondering what
shes up to we DISSOLVE TO

LATER Annalise is now cross-examining LIONEL BRANDT (50s) a
professional well-coifed Ad Man Our students all watching

ANNALISE (CONTD)
Mr Brandt you met with Mr Levinson
in his office the morning of the
accident correct

LIONEL BRANDT
Yes As co-CEOs we have a weekly
new business meeting
ANNALISE
Was there any discussion about my
client in the meeting

LIONEL BRANDT
Yes Arthur told me he was moving
Gina to accounting

ANNALISE
So to avoid any possible sexual
harassment lawsuit

LIONEL BRANDT
Thats correct

ANNALISE
Mr Brandt will you please read
this email

Annalise now hands Lionel the printed email Patrick gave her

PROSECUTOR BALDWIN
Your honor can the defense please
specify what shes just handed the
witness

ANNALISE
My apologies This is an email the
witness wrote to Mr Levinson It
was in the discovery file given to
us by the prosecution your honor

A stunned Patrick hears this muttering so only Wes can hear

PATRICK
OMG

WES
What

He doesnt answer instead watching as Lionel reads the email

LIONEL BRANDT
Dear Arthur after several days trying
to reason with you Im officially
requesting that you step down as co-
CEO Ive warned you about having
sexual relations with employees of
this company and have grown frustrated
with your refusal to stop--

PROSECUTOR BALDWIN
Your honor this email was not part
of the discovery file

JUDGE POWELL
Ms DeWitt is that true

ANNALISE
(feigning surprise)
Oh I thought it was Although my
junior counsel is more familiar with
the paperwork on this case Bonnie

Bonnie stands not missing a beat Patrick watches in awe

BONNIE
I found the email in the files given
to us by our clients previous
attorney your honor I just assumed
it was part of the discovery file

PROSECUTOR BALDWIN
It wasnt Which means it was
obviously obtained illegally

ANNALISE
That is a ridiculous assumption
your honor

JUDGE POWELL
Is it Ms DeWitt

ANNALISE
Yes Not to mention the fact that
the content of this email pertains
to the case It clearly shouldve
already been admitted into evidence

PROSECUTOR BALDWIN
The contents irrelevant its all
fruit of the poisonous tree

JUDGE POWELL
ENOUGH
(then to Lionel)
Did you write this email Mr Brandt

LIONEL BRANDT
Yes

JUDGE POWELL
Then I have to side with Ms DeWitt
here The emails admissible

PROSECUTOR BALDWIN
Your honor

JUDGE POWELL
Ive made my decision Mr Baldwin

37

ANNALISE
Thank you your honor -- Mr
Brandt as stated in your email you
were angry at Mr Levinson for taking
part in a sexual relationship with
an employee

LIONEL BRANDT
I was frustrated yes

ANNALISE
So frustrated that perhaps you decided
to swap his blood pressure pill for
an aspirin during your meeting

PROSECUTOR BALDWIN
OBJECTION

JUDGE POWELL
Ms Dewitt

ANNALISE
I withdraw the last question your
honor Nothing further

Annalise sits point made nodding to Gina as the whole courtroom
buzzes about this masterful play

INT HALLWAY COURTHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
Annalise Frank and Bonnie approach our 20 waiting students

Patrick looks right at Michaela grins Wes smiles enjoying
their feud

ANNALISE (CONTD)

She leaves Bonnie and Frank in tow as Michaela turns on Patrick

MICHAELA
Howd you get that email

PATRICK
I dont kiss and tell

MICHAELA
What the hell does that mean

As Michaela chases after Patrick Laurel rolls her eyes and peels
off from the group always one to avoid the fray We go with her
as she walks toward the restroom and passes wheelchair-bound
Arthur agitated as he clings to his wife Agnes

ARTHUR
No NO Please dont please dont

AGNES

As Laurel takes that in -- wow thats depressing -- she enters--

Where Gina is checking her make-up in the mirror Laurel pauses
thinking for a moment then hurries into a stall so Gina doesnt
see her And now were inside the stall with Laurel She peeks
through the crack in the door just as Agnes enters stopping as
she sees Gina The two of them look at each other and instead
of the awkward tense encounter between wife and mistress we all
expect Agnes smiles and gives Gina a tender squeeze on the hand
before heading into a stall As Laurel takes this in her head
now spinning

INT DEANS HOUSE - NIGHT

Across the room Wes spots Patrick Michaela and Doucheface
talking to TOM (40s handsome friendly) Tom is a breath of
fresh air in this competitive environment -- positive encouraging
nice even As Wes joins

TOM
First years the worst no doubt
Just put your head down do the work
and try not to take it so seriously

DOUCHEFACE
Youre obviously not a lawyer

TOM
A psychology professor I know
youve just lost all respect for me
but I work with the firm sometimes --
evaluating clients reading witnesses
(noticing Wes)
And you are

TOM
There she is Let me guess -- your

ears were burning

And as they all laugh and Tom gives his wife a tender kiss on the
cheek Annalise stares straight at Wes and we --

ACT FOUR
EXT WOODS - NIGHT - FLASH FORWARD 31

Back in the woods where our four exhausted aching students lug
the rug through the dark Patrick holds a flashlight when they
SUDDENLY HEAR GIGGLING IN THE DISTANCE Our four all hit the
ground hiding Wes whispers to Patrick

WES
Flashlight

Patrick shuts it off just as a DRUNK COUPLE comes into view
heading right for them Our four all share looks panicked as
the couple finally stops making out up against a nearby tree

DRUNK GIRL
Hey Jen cant find out about this

DRUNK GUY
Im not gonna tell her

And now they kiss again pulling at their zippers about to go
for it right there our four all panicking whena RINGTONE PLAYS

DRUNK GIRL
What is that

Its Laurels cell As she goes to silence it we see the name
Frank along with a PHOTO of him smiling on the phones screen

DRUNK GUY
Hey Whos there

Our four stay silent faces pressed into the dirt

DRUNK GIRL
Can we get out of here

And now the couple runs off as fast as they can Once theyre
gone Laurel breathes a big sigh of relief That is until--

MICHAELA
Why is Frank calling you

LAUREL
(caught)
What

MICHAELA
I saw your phone Laurel What the
hells going on

And as Michaela Patrick and Wes all stare at her waiting for
an answer we HOLD ON LAURELS SCARED FACE AND FLASHBACK TO --

32 EXT ANNALISES HOUSEOFFICE - NIGHT - 4 MONTHS EARLIER

Laurel 4 months earlier knocks on the front door Frank answers

LAUREL
Frank hi Im in DeWitts class

FRANK
Shouldnt you be at that party

LAUREL
I hate those things And I saw
something today at the courthouse
that I think you should know about

And as Frank wonders what she means we TIME CUT TO
33 INT LIVING ROOM ANNALISES HOUSEOFFICE - MOMENTS LATER
Where Frank is now laughing at Laurel Hard

FRANK

Sorry I was just imagining if
Annalise heard what just came out of
your mouth Ooohff it wouldve
been ugly

(then straight faced)
But of course you already knew that
or else you wouldve gone to her
with this tall tale rather than me

And now hes just looking right through her

LAUREL
I only saw them touch hands I know
but think about it A wife gets so
tired of her husband cheating that
she enlists his mistress to team up
for revenge

FRANK
Fine say youre right they went
tag team on the guy What the hell
do you expect us to do about it
Put you on the stand so the jury
will definitely have enough evidence
to convict our client

LAUREL
Noobviously not I just
(beat realizing)
You already knew

FRANK
I didnt say that

Frank just holds her look His face betraying nothing Laurel
suddenly understands just who shes dealing with here

LAUREL
Right Because then youd actually
be admitting out loud that youre
defending a guilty client And who
really has time to deal with the
moral repercussions of that

Pissed Laurel starts to head out Frank calls after her

FRANK
Brown right Or was it Smith
Berkeley What bastion of liberalism
turned you into such a goody goody

Laurel stops turns back to him suddenly feeling naked

LAUREL
Brown -- You read my application
or something

FRANK
Just a guess We get a lot of you
around here Smart idealistic girls
who come to law school to help the
less fortunate only to end up taking
a corporate job after graduation
which they then quit the second they
get pregnant because theyd rather
stay home For the child of course

LAUREL
Youre a misogynistic ass

She storms off slamming the door on her way out Only now does
Frank look up to see Bonnie standing there having heard all that

BONNIE
Stop Screwing The students

She leaves Frank calling after her as she goes

FRANK
Who else am I gonna screw We live
at this office I dont have time to
go meet real girls

She doesnt answer already gone as we stay with Frank whose
face drops just the slightest to reveal the loneliness underneath
the tough-guy act But now he pushes it away gets back to work

INT DEANS HOUSE - NIGHT 34

Back at the party where Patrick Michaela Doucheface and a

She stops her voice cracking eyes welling up Wes -- and we --
are shocked This isnt a person we ever thought wed see cry

Weve been trying to have a baby
For a long time now And I hate to
make excuses butits been a lot

she might kiss him or hit him You just can never tell with her

ANNALISE (CONTD)
Thank you for keeping this between
us

Shes holding his look intense So Wes just nods

WES
No problem Ill justleave now

He rushes out the door But we stay with Annalise who just stares
at herself in the mirror her tears quickly drying up because
well it was all an act As she cleans up her now runny mascara
matter of fact and emotionless us wondering what her deal is

INT LIVING ROOM ANNALISES HOUSEOFFICE - NIGHT 36

perfect Bonnie watches a little uncomfortable clearly knowing
some secrets Finally they break apart Annalise smiling

ANNALISE

TOM

Go home Youve won the case already

He heads upstairs as Annalise walks into
INT ANNALISES OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
She gets on her computer as Frank enters with some FILES

FRANK
Here are the background checks
Mostly DUIs and pot possession
Although you should know the annoying
kids dad is a circuit judge

He means Doucheface whose filephoto Annalise now stops at as
she flips through the students files

ANNALISE
That could be helpful Put him in
the yes pile Along with these

She hands him some of the files back but Frank sees that Laurel
is now on top of the reject pile He pauses for a beat thinking
about Bonnies advice but then picks up Laurels file anyway

FRANK
Actually this girls pretty good

ANNALISE

FRANK
Thats actually her strength She
flies under the radar notices things
We could use someone like that

ANNALISE
Fine put her back in Also run

FRANK
I thought we gave that kid the ax

ANNALISE
I changed my mind Wes is his name
Wes Gibbins

And as Frank leaves us wondering what plan Annalise has for Wes

INT WESS APARTMENT - NIGHT 38

Where Wes lies in bed mind still racing heavy with the burden
of Annalises secret as he stares at the fingernail scratches on
the wall And now he puts his own hand up to them seeing that
his hand is an exact match As he traces the scratches he
suddenly hears someone outside his door a shadow peeking through
Wes jumps up opens the door and finds -- a BOTTLE OF SCOTCH

WES
Hey

Hes talking to Rebecca now trying to sneak into her apartment

REBECCA
Oh Hey Thats just to say sorry
for the other night And the night
before that I stole it from the
bar I work at so dont think Im

WES
Ive heard the music you listen to
I never thought you were nice
She smiles shy but charmed then goes to unlock her door as Wes
now looks at the post-it attached to the bottle -- Welcome to
the neighborhood Rebecca And now he gets a burst of courage
WES (CONTD)
Rebecca Should we open it maybe
I kinda had a weird night and could
use some heavy drinking

REBECCA
I cant tonight sorry

She goes into her apartment Off Wes a little crush forming
EXT COURTHOUSE - MORNING 39
Another day in court

ANNALISE (PRE-LAP)
Your honor this is a trick

INT COURTROOM - CONTINUOUS 40
A livid Annalise now stands up yelling
ANNALISE
The prosecution hasnt informed me

about any new evidence

JUDGE POWELL
Approach the bench counsel

Annalise and the prosecutor go to the judge

PROSECUTOR BALDWIN
The police just gave me the video
last night Annalise You can try
and stall all you want but its
damning enough without showing the
jury you dont want them to see it

JUDGE POWELL
Its your call Ms DeWitt

And as Annalise debates we TIME CUT TO

MOMENTS LATER The prosecutor questions a very young nervous
DETECTIVE GILL (25 voice shaky) who is now on the stand

PROSECUTOR BALDWIN
You got the call from the convenience
store when Detective Gill

DETECTIVE GILL
Approximately 7pm on Tuesday

PROSECUTOR BALDWIN
So 2 nights ago What happened next

DETECTIVE GILL
I went to the store and met with the
owner Mr Lira who gave me the
original copy of his surveillance
camera video He said he saw the
defendants picture on the news and
remembered she came into his store a
few months ago how she seemed real
nervous at the time so he looked
through his old surveillance video
until he found the footage of her

PROSECUTOR BALDWIN
Footage that I will now play for
everyone here

He presses play on a remote SURVEILLANCE VIDEO FROM A CONVENIENCE
STORE now playing on screens for the entire courtroom Theres

no audio but theres a date stamped into the image as Gina is
shown buying a bottle of pills at the register As he PAUSES

PROSECUTOR BALDWIN (CONTD)
There The night before the murder
attempt Ms Sadowski bought this
item at Mr Liras store And if we
zoom in on the bottle what does it
say Detective

DETECTIVE GILL
Soloxacore Its a brand of aspirin

As Bonnie and Frank share a look -- were fucked -- the prosecutor
turns to Annalise

PROSECUTOR BALDWIN
Your witness

ANNALISE
Your honor Id like a recess

JUDGE POWELL
Youve got one hour Ms DeWitt

And as the courtroom breaks up Patrick turns to Wes

PATRICK
Aaaand were screwed

41 INT HALLWAY COURTHOUSE - DAY
Where our stunned students stand by a door eavesdropping

ANNALISE (0S)
You had one job

42 INT COURTHOUSE ANTECHAMBER - CONTINUOUS

Inside Annalise YELLS at a teary Gina Its the first time were
seeing Annalises full fury Its powerful and scary and clearly
what makes her good at her job Bonnie and Frank look away

ANNALISE
To let us know what bodies we needed
to bury Texts calls ANYTHING WE
NEEDED TO DESTROY You didnt so
guess what You go to jail and Im
the shoddy lawyer who put you there

GINA
I had a headache It isnt what it--

ANNALISE
STOP LYING TO ME

Gina startles shaking Finally Annalise breathes

ANNALISE (CONTD)
Get out I cant think with you here

Gina flees Once theyre alone
FRANK

Shes not wrong Annalise Its
aspirin we all buy it--

Annalise leaves
comforting when suddenly he PICKS UP A CHAIR AND THROWS IT
it CRASHES AGAINST THE DOOR we CUT TO

ANNALISE
Who was it Frank What slutty
undergrad pulled down her pants and
made you forget how to do your job
this time

FRANK
I grilled Gina the minute we got
this case She obviously chose not
to tell me this because well its
obvious aint it Shes guilty--

ANNALISE
ENOUGH WITH THE EXCUSES
And the way Annalise now looks at him -- a mix of disgust and
rage -- makes this grown man cower
FRANK

Im sorry Ill do better next time

Bonnie steps forward taking control the mediator

BONNIE
We have 1 hour I say we put Gina on
the stand have her testify that she
had a migraine

ANNALISE
The prosecution will destroy her in
the cross Our only option is to
discredit the video

FRANK
We could call the store owner into
question

BONNIE
Yes throw doubt into why it took
him so long to turn over the footage

ANNALISE
No

BONNIE
Its a good idea

ANNALISE
And I have a better one No thanks
to either of you

Bonnie looks to Frank about to say something

As

INT COURTROOM - ONE HOUR LATER 43

Wes Patrick Laurel Michaela and all the students are straining
to hear whats going on at the front of the courtroom where
Annalise and the prosecutor are sidebar-ing with Judge Powell

PROSECUTOR BALDWIN
Hes not a detective on this case
your honor I dont see how his
testimony could be at all relevant

ANNALISE
Relevance will become clear during
testimony And his sudden addition
to our witness list is a result of
the prosecution conveniently springing
this video on us at the last minute

JUDGE POWELL
Ill allow the testimony I assume
the witness is here and ready to
testify

ANNALISE
I had him called in

JUDGE POWELL
Lets move it along then

Annalise and the prosecutor return to their tables

ANNALISE
Id like to call our first witness
to the stand Detective Nate Seidel

Our students share a confused look --

LAUREL
Whos that

WES
I have no idea--

But Wes stops -- because now he sees DETECTIVE NATE SEIDEL enter from the back of the courtroom Detective Nate Seidel who
is also the Naked Man he saw Annalise having sex with in Act 2
Nate walks up the aisle whispering angrily and discretely to
Annalise as he passes her

NATE
What the hell is this

She doesnt answer but just smiles not giving him anything as
Nate now then heads to take the oath Off Wes -- and all of the
audience -- wondering what in the hell Annalise is up to as we --

END ACT FOUR

ACT FIVE
EXT CLEARING IN WOODS - NIGHT - FLASH FORWARD 44
Our Four now reach the same spot where we first met them as they
drag the rug to the middle of the clearing Exhausted chests
heaving they all collapse on the ground Except for Wes

WES
Come on get up we have to do this

They dont move So beaten down

WES (CONTD)
I SAID GET UP

They finally stand as we STAY ON Wes who now pulls a BOTTLE OF
LIGHTER FLUID from the 7-11 bag And as we realize theyre going

to burn the body we HOLD ON a tireless Wes and FLASHBACK TO

INT COURTROOM - DAY - 4 MONTHS EARLIER 45

Where a now confused Wes watches Annalise question her lover
Nate vibrates with anger visibly pissed to be here

ANNALISE
Detective Seidel a junior detective
under your supervision just testified
that 2 nights ago he received a
video my client appears in

PROSECUTOR BALDWIN
Your honor Detective Seidel wasnt
here when that video was played

ANNALISE
Im simply trying to establish a
timeline here your honor

JUDGE POWELL
Get to your point Ms DeWitt

Annalise goes to the stand and puts her hand on the box her
fingers just inches away from Nate She looks him in the eye
direct and eerily calm as she now drops a bomb--

ANNALISE

Where were you 2 nights ago Detective
NATE

What
ANNALISE

2 nights ago when Detective Gill
acquired this tape werent you
(MORE )

ANNALISE (CONTD)
supposed to be working at the precinct
as Detective Gills direct supervisor

Nate looks to our young Detective Gill sitting in the front row

NATE
I was

ANNALISE
And were you there

And as Nate now sits there stunned we move to Wes who is equally
stunned because of course he knows where all three of them were
2 nights ago a scene we now QUICKLY FLASHBACK TO

46 INT ANNALISES HOUSEOFFICE - NIGHT 46

Wes knocks on her office door

WES
Professor DeWitt--

And the slight pressure of his knock now makes the door slide
open enough so Wes now can now see a NAKED MAN NATE POP UP FROM
BELOW THE DESK Annalise jumps up quickly pulling down her skirt

WES (CONTD)
Oh my god

NATE
Get the hell out

CUT BACK TO
47 INT COURTROOM - DAY 47

CLOSE ON WES his mind spinning as he watches Annalise in action
Nate hasnt answered yet just glaring at his girlfriend

ANNALISE
Please answer the question Detective

NATE
No I was not

ANNALISE
Where were you then Home perhaps
Taking care of your wife I
understand shes recently been
diagnosed with cancer

And now Nate gets just what Annalise is doing here that shes
threatening him and that he better play along He answers

NATE
No Iwas at a friends

ANNALISE
Okay Lets be clear then 2 nights
ago when you were scheduled to be
at work you were not present when
Detective Gill received this footage

NATE
Thats correct

ANNALISE
I only ask because theres something
I find strange about the chain of
custody on this video Detective
Gill testified that he received the
video from the store owner at 8pm
but the logs say he didnt log it
into custody until 209am Dont
you find that time gap odd

NATE
No Sometimes it can take us a while
to log evidence into the computer

ANNALISE
Because youre all so busy Visiting
friends and such

Shit Annalise is out for blood Wes watches it all his heart
pounding as he waits to see what will happen next

NATE
Im sure Detective Gill had a good
reason why it took him that long

ANNALISE
Perhaps Or perhaps he needed the
extra time to doctor the video and
further incriminate my client

PROSECUTOR BALDWIN
Your honor

JUDGE POWELL
That was out of line Ms DeWitt

ANNALISE
I withdraw my last statement --
Detective in your 12 years working
for the city of Philadelphia have
you ever known an instance where
video footage was altered to help
the prosecution get a conviction

PROSECUTOR BALDWIN
Objection

ANNALISE
Digitally adding an aspirin label to
a bottle of vitamins for example

PROSECUTOR BALDWIN
YOUR HONOR

And now Annalise turns to the judge quick and badass

ANNALISE
Im simply asking Detective Seidel
about his personal experience within
his department

JUDGE POWELL
This is the last question Ill allow

ANNALISE
Thank you your honor
(then to Nate)
Are you personally aware of any
instances of doctored surveillance
footage within your department

And now the whole room waits for Nate to answer the question
But Nate just looks straight at Annalise her looking right back
at him Its a stand off Finally Nate answers

NATE
Yes I am

And as the whole courtroom ERUPTS Wes shocked we SMASH CUT TO
EXT COURTHOUSE - DAY
A victorious Annalise stands with Gina before a GROUP OF REPORTERS

ANNALISE
I took this case pro bono knowing an
innocent woman had been scapegoated
by a desperate overworked DAs
office Gina is and always has been
innocent and were just so happy the
jury was able to see that

At the bottom of the steps our students watch in absolute awe

MICHAELA
I want to be her

PATRICK
Me too

LAUREL
(quiet)
I dont

Wes looks to Laurel noticing that shes watching Agnes Levinson
stand at a nearby curb as Arthurs nurse helps him into the car
Agnes is looking straight at Gina the two of them sharing a
knowing conspiratorial smile And then Agnes climbs into the
car Wes now whispering to Laurel

WES
What do you know

Laurel turns to Wes Debating whether to tell him

LAUREL
Nothing

And as Laurel leaves we go OFF WES watching Annalise with the
press and wondering whether this case was all one big lie

INT LECTURE HALL - DAY

Criminal Law class the white board full of legal legal as Annalise
finishes up Frank and Bonnie are also there

ANNALISE
Tomorrow we start work on a new case --
a pastor accused of embezzling from
his own church -- so lets find out
which of you will be helping us out
at the office First the standout
of this class the one you should
all make it your mission to destroy
Mr Donahue come get your trophy

And like a king rising to take his rightful crown Patrick collects
his trophy from Annalise

PATRICK

He turns shooting a little ha ha glance at an enraged Michaela

ANNALISE
The others joining us will beAsher
Millstone

DOUCHEFACE
Yes

Doucheface pumps his fist everyone rolling their eyes Of course

ANNALISE
Laurel Wilding

Stunned Laurel looks to Frank smiling right at her which Bonnie
clocks rolling her eyes knowing exactly where this is going

But now the whole class sits up straighter dying to be the last
name called especially Michaela who might pee her pants

ANNALISE (CONTD)
Michaela Pratt

MICHAELA
Oh thank god
(to Annalise)
I mean -- thank you
(to Bonnie and Frank)
All of you

Everyone sinks in their seats defeated Wes looks relieved when--
ANNALISE
And because our workload has grown
Ive decided to hire one more of
you That student isWes Gibbins

And as the whole room goes quiet shocked but no one more so
than Wes we CUT TO

EXT MAIN QUAD MIDDLETON UNIVERSITY - DAY
Wes catches up to Annalise

WES
Professor DeWitt

ANNALISE
Wes How can I help you

She smiles like there are no secrets between them A beat passes
as Wes gathers the strength to say this

WES
So that detective

ANNALISE
Is my boyfriend Yes

She holds his look Direct Unapologetic And before he even
knows what hes doing he says --

WES
I dont want the job Not if you
picked me because of that

ANNALISE
That

WES
You got him to lie on the stand
About there being doctored videos

Annalise just looks at him her face revealing nothing She takes
a step closer Intense yet calm

ANNALISE
Is that why I picked you Because I
thought I picked you for showing
initiative coming to my office that
night And because your directed
verdict idea showed you think outside
the box And because your self
defense argument proved you were
good on your feet Those are all
qualities I look for in my employees
I was excited for you to be one of
them But now that youve exposed
exactly what you think of yourself
that you dont believe you deserve
this job--

WES
Thats not what I--

ANNALISE
That is exactly what you said Right
before you accused me of having my
boyfriend lie under oath to win this
case We won because of our defense --
pinning it on the business partner
discrediting an eye-witness making
the jury feel for Gina But of course
you dont understand that because
you dont understand anything Youre
a 1L -- soft uneducated dumb So
dumb you might still decide to turn
down this job

Wes stops looking up at her surprised

ANNALISE (CONTD)
Yes Im letting you reconsider
Think carefully because everything
that comes after this moment will
determine not the type of career you
have but life You can either spend
it in a sad corporate office drafting
contracts and hitting on chubby
paralegals until finally putting a
gun in your mouthor you can join
my firm and become a person who does
something with his life So decide
Now Do you want the job or not

Off Wes both repulsed and attracted terrified and excited

going to do something terrible he opens the door to the attic
heads upstairs and opens another door that brings us out to --

THE ROOF He heads over to a 6 foot high WATER TANK opens the
lid and reaches his hand inside He feels around deeper now
struggling to get a hold of an object blocking the pipe FINALLY

A long beat as Annalise takes in his fury But if shes scared

ANNALISE

He holds her look debating whether to trust her Finally he
takes a step back getting control A long moment passes

ANNALISE (CONTD)
And lets be clear -- youre the one
who picked me up

And now shes smiling sexy and flirty and in control which is
all Nate needs to push her up against the garage kissing her
hungrily her kissing him back And as they tear at each others
clothes gasping and grinding and engaging in the kind of public
messy animal sex wed never dare have ourselves we move to
