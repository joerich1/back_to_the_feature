JFK
By
Oliver Stone and Zachary Sklar
Based on books by

Jim Marrs and Jim Garrison

FADE IN

Credits run in counterpoint through a 7 to 10 minute sequence
of documentary images setting the tone of John F Kennedys
Presidency and the atmosphere of those tense times 1960
through 1963 An omniscient narrators voice marches us
through in old time Pathe newsreel fashion

VOICE
January 1961 - President Dwight D
Eisenhowers Farewell Address to the
Nation -

EISENHOWER ADDRESS

EISENHOWER
The conjunction of an immense military
establishment and a large arms
industry is new in the American
experience The total influence -
economic political even spiritual -
is felt in every city every
statehouse every office of the
Federal Government In the councils
of government we must guard against
the acquisition of unwarranted
influence whether sought or unsought
by the military industrial complex
The potential for the disastrous
rise of misplaced power exists and
will persist We must never let
the weight of this combination
endanger our liberties or democratic
processes We should take nothing
for granted

ELECTION IMAGERY

School kids reciting the Pledge of Allegiance WPA films of
farmers harvesting the Texas plains Rain thunderheads a
dusty car coming from far away on a road moving towards
Dallas Cowboys round up the cattle Young marrieds in a
church Hillsides of tract homes going up The American
breadbasket the West Over this we hear Eisenhowers
address As we move into the election campaign of 1960 we
see the TV debates Nixon vs Kennedy Mayor Daley Kennedy
victorious

Against this is juxtaposed other forces segregation J
Edgar Hoover military advisors Castro Marilyn Monroe
Lumumba three frames of the Zapruder film counter-cut
ending with the Kennedy inauguration and the irony of Earl
Warren administering the oath as he will Kennedys eulogy

VOICE 2

November 1960 - Senator John F
Kennedy of Massachusetts wins one of
the narrowest election victories in
American history over the Vice-
President Richard Nixon by a little
more than 100000 votes Rumors
abound that he stole the election in
Illinois through the Democratic
political machine of Mayor Daley

(inauguration shots)
At his inauguration at a time when
American males all wore hats he let
his hair blow free in the wind
Alongside his beautiful and elegant
wife of French origin Jacqueline
Bouvier JFK is the symbol of the
new freedom of the 1960s signifying
change and upheaval to the American
public scaring many and hated
passionately by some To win the
election and to appease their fears
Kennedy at first takes a tough Cold
War stance

BAY OF PIGS IMAGERY

The beach the bombardment the rounding up of prisoners
Kennedys public apology Allen Dulles standing next to
JFK both uncomfortable with the small talk

VOICE 3
He inherits a secret war against the
Communist Castro dictatorship in
Cuba a war run by the CIA and angry
Cuban exiles out of bases in the
Southern United States Panama
Nicaragua and Guatemala Castro is
a successful revolutionary frightening
to American business interests in
Latin America - companies like Cabots
United Fruit Continental Can and
Rockefellers Standard Oil This
war culminates in the disastrous Bay
of Pigs invasion in April 1961 when
Kennedy refuses to provide air cover
for the exile brigade Of the 1600
men who invade 114 are killed 1200
are captured The Cuban exiles and
the CIA are furious at Kennedys
irresolution Kennedy taking public
responsibility for the failure
privately claims the CIA lied to him
and tried to manipulate him into
ordering an all-out American invasion
of Cuba He vows to splinter the

CIA into a thousand pieces and fires
Director Allen Dulles Deputies
Charles Cabell and Richard Bissell
the top leadership of the Agency

SECRET WAR IMAGERY

Cuban rallies footage of training camps espionage
activities boats cases of weapons Robert Kennedy John
Roselli Sam Giancana Santos Trafficante Richard Helms

Hunt

VOICE 4

The CIA however continues its
secret war on Castro with dozens of
sabotage and assassination attempts
under its ZRRIFLE and MONGOOSE
programs - The Agency collaborates
with organized crime elements such
as John Roselli Sam Giancana and
Santos Trafficante of Tampa whose
casino operations in Cuba worth
more than a hundred million dollars
a year in income Castro has shut
down

CUBAN MISSILE CRISIS

Khrushchev Kennedy Castro on television meetings with
Cabinet Russian vessels in Caribbean US nuclear bases on
alert civilians going to underground safe areas the
Russian ship turning around the country smiling

VOICE 5
In October 1962 the world comes to
the brink of nuclear war when Kennedy
quarantines Cuba after announcing
the presence of offensive Soviet
nuclear missiles 90 miles off American
shores The Joint Chiefs of Staff
and the CIA call for an invasion
Kennedy refuses Soviet ships with
more missiles sail towards the island
but at the last moment turn back
The world breathes with relief but
backstage in Washington rumors abound
that JFK has cut a secret deal

with Russian Premier Khrushchev not

to invade Cuba in return for a Russian
withdrawal of missiles Suspicions
abound that Kennedy is soft on
Communism

NUCLEAR TEST BAN IMAGERY

Closing down Cuban Camps McNamara speaking Khrushchev and
Kennedy the hot line telephone system inaugurated Kennedy
with Jackie and children sailing off Cape Cod Vietnam
introduction early shots Green Berets counterinsurgency
programs De Lansdale leading up to the Test Ban signings
then JFK at American University June 10 1963

VOICE 6
In the ensuing months Kennedy clamps
down on Cuban exile activities
closing training camps restricting
covert operations prohibiting
ipment of weapons out of the
ountry The covert arm of the CIA
evertheless continues its plan to
ssassinate Castor In March 63
ennedy announces drastic cuts in
e defense budget In November
963 he orders the withdrawal by
ristmas of the first 1000 troops
f the 16000 stationed in Vietnam
e tells several of his intimates
at he will withdraw all Vietnam
troops after the 64 election saying
to the Assistant Secretary of State
Roger Hilsman The Bay of Pigs has
taught me one not to trust generals
or the CIA and two that if the
American people do not want to use
American troops to remove a Communist
regime 90 miles from our coast how
can I ask them to use troops to remove
a Communist regime 9000 miles
away Finally in August 1963
over the objections of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff the United States
Great Britain and the Soviet Union
sign a treaty banning nuclear bomb
tests in the atmosphere underwater
and in space Early that fateful
summer Kennedy speaks of his new
vision at American University in
Washington

tmoagranoa pana
What kind of peace do we seek Not
a pax Americana enforced on the world

by American weapons of war We
must re-examine our own attitudes
towards the Soviet Union If we

cannot now end our differences at
least we can help make the world
safe for diversity For in the
final analysis our most basic link
is that we all inhabit this small
planet We all breathe the same
air We all cherish our childrens
future And we are all mortal

CONCLUDING KENNEDY IMAGERY

Diplomats at the United Nations Adlai Stevenson Castor
Martin Luther King and the March on Washington (a snatch of
his I Have a Dream speech) Bobby Kennedy and Jimmy Hoffa
going at it US Steel Chairmans remarks in the steel
face-off men going to courtrooms with briefcases Teddy
Kennedy Rose Joe the Kennedy family all teeth and good
looks and of course John campaigning always campaigning
shaking hands smiling that supremely warm smile and sense
of grace and ability to convey to crowds their oneness with

him forever culminating in the more specific Texas
shots with Jackie in San Antonio and Houston then at
Fort Worth then at Love Field moving through the clouds

toward the DallasForth Worth plain which suddenly breaks
into view as we descend

LOUISIANA HIGHWAY - DAY A moving car carrying two Cuban males disgorges a rumpled
screaming woman Rose Cheramie a whore in her thirties
lying there bleeding in the dirt The car drives off

HOSPITAL - DAY We see Rose badly cut but quite lucid trying to reason
with a policeman Lt Fruge and a doctor - in a remote black-
and-white documentary

ROSE
Theyre going up to Dallas to
whack Kennedy Friday the 22nd
thats when theyre going to do it
In Dealey Plaza Theyre gonna whack
him You gotta call somebody these
are serious fuckin guys

DOCTOR
(to the police officer)
Highern a kite on something Been
like this since she came in
BACK TO DOCUMENTARY IMAGES

We see the last close-ups of Kennedy shaking hands on the
tarmac at Love Field smiling into the motorcade the
downtown streets of Dallas people packing the sidewalks
clear back to the buildings hanging out of windows ten
stories up schoolgirls surging out into the street in front
of the car The President is wildly popular - except for
the occasional posters calling for his arrest for treason

VOICE 7
More rumors emerge of JFKs
backdoor efforts outside usual State
Department and CIA channels to
establish dialogue with Fidel Castro
through contacts at the United Nations
in New York Kennedy is seeking
change on all fronts Bitter battles
are fought with Southern
segregationists to get James Meredith
into the University of Mississippi
Three months after Kennedy submits a
sweeping civil rights bill to
Congress Martin Luther King leads
250000 in a march on Washington
Robert Kennedy as Attorney General
for the first time ever vigorously
prosecutes the Mafia in American
life bringing and winning a record
number of cases - 288 convictions of
organized crime figures including 13
grand juries against Jimmy Hoffa and
his Teamsters Union The President
also takes on Big Business forcing
back steel prices winning 45 of 46
antitrust cases during 1963 and he
wants to help everyday taxpayers by
ending age- old business privileges
like the oil depletion allowance and
the fees paid to the Federal Reserve
Bank for printing Americas currency
Revolutionary changes are foreseen
after JFKs assumed re-election
in 1964 Foremost in the political
consciousness of the country is the
possibility of a Kennedy dynasty
Robert Kennedy in 68 Teddy Kennedy
in 76 In November 1963 John
Kennedy travels to Texas his
popularity sagging to 59 largely
due to his civil rights stand for
which he is particularly hated in
the South Texas is a crucial state
for him to carry in 64 With him
is Vice-President Lyndon Johnson
and Texas Governor John Connally

On November 21 they visit Houston
and San Antonio On the morning of
November 22 he speaks in Fort Worth
then flies 15 minutes to Love Field
in Dallas where he takes a motorcade
through downtown Dallas on his way

to speak at 1230 at the International
Trade Mart Later the motorcade
takes him through Dealey Plaza at
1230

DEALEY PLAZA - THAT DAY (NOV 22 1963)

We see a massive overhead shot of the Plaza as it lay then
Credits conclude under shot - and we have the subtitle
November 22 1963

A young epileptic screams and suddenly collapses near the
fountains in front of the Texas School Depository He has a
violent epileptic fit that attracts surrounding attention
Dallas policemen run over to him We hear the siren of an
ambulance roaring up

TIMECUT TO ambulance loading the epileptic man and taking
off

AMBULANCE VOICE
We are en route to Parkland

BACK TO a montage of the shooting We see Kennedy in the
last seconds waving turning the corner at Houston from
Main We see TV footage and a piece of Zapruder film from
before the shooting fragmented images

CUT TO stages shots of crowd people looking on The images
are grainy to match the tone of the Zapruder film People

are on rooftops hollering The crowd is wild with
enthusiasm We pan past Jack Ruby and slam into him in black-
and-white The camera shows a Cuban man with a radio a man
with an umbrella subliminals Through open windows on the
fifth floor of the Criminal Courts Building convicts watch
and holler from their jail cells We see the sixth floor of
the Texas Book Depository with open windows and a vague blur
of a figure and a rifle

The clock on the Hertz sign reads 1230

VOICE
Well be there in about five minutes

A motorcycle officer paralleling the Kennedy car tries to
use his radio

Its jammed The sound of the jammed Dictabelt drives the
rest of the sequence
We see Zapruder a short middle - aged man shooting his 8mm
film from the Grassy Knoll and then we see Jackie Kennedy -
floating on film her voice high soft

JACKIE KENNEDY

(voice restaged)
And in the motorcade you know I
usually would be waving mostly to
the left side and he was waving mostly
to the right which is one reason
youre not looking at each other
very much And it was terribly hot
Just blinding all of us We could
see a tunnel in front of us
Everything was really slow then
And I remember thinking it would be
so cool under that tunnel

The camera rests on Jackie for a beat and then we see the
shot of the little schoolgirl skipping on the grass

CUT TO the approaching overpass JFK waves Mrs
Connally turns to JFK The shot is crazy fractured
surreal

MRS CONNALLY (VO)
Mr President you cant say that
Dallas doesnt love you

JFK (VO)
No you certainly cant

Then we hear the shots the volley sounds like a motorcycle
backfire We catch a glimpse of a muzzle flash and smoke

We see a view from the street of the Texas School Book
Depository - all in line with the official version of
events Pigeons by the hundreds suddenly shoot off the roof
Then the screen goes gray as did CBS TVs first bulletins to
the country

CBS BULLETIN

(full screen)
We interrupt this program to bring
you this flash bulletin A burst of
gunfire Three bursts of gunfire
apparently from automatic weapons
were fired at President Kennedys
motorcade in downtown Dallas

VOICES
(blending under)
IT CAME FROM THERE SECURE THAT
AREA BEHIND THE FENCE ITS THAT
BUILDING UP THERE

We hear sirens and screeching tires The screen is still
gray randomly intercut with the end of the Nix film showing
the car escaping There are wildly tracking shots of the
crowd running towards the Grassy Knoll

The camera pans up the little set of stairs We see more
faces

Someone in a suit stops our camera Secret Service

We see the briefest glimpse from the Zapruder film The
camera moves in on the open umbrella next then to the freeway
sign then to Mrs Kennedy out of the car reaching for help
then to the agent rushing onto the rear fender The car
finally speeds away The people on the other side of the
underpass wave at the oncoming hearse from hell (These are
fragmented mystifying shots The main effect is one of
blackout - of not knowing of being in the dark as we all
were back then)

CUT TO JIM GARRISONS OFFICE - NEW ORLEANS - SAME DAY Pause The lovely old china clock on the wall reads 1235
Somewhere a car backfires We see a close-up of the clock
moving to 1236 We hear the sound of a pen on paper
scratching We see a shot of Jim Garrison as a young air
pilot in World War II hear the sound of airplanes The
camera moves to framed photos of Jim as a young Lincolnesque
lawyer we hear sounds of political rallies cheering a
shot of Jims grandfather shaking hands with President William
Taft The sound of bulldozers carries us to a shot of Jim
staring at piles of decaying corpses at Dachau a photo of
Clarence Darrow a law degree and an appointment as District
Attorney of the New Orleans Parish Mother Garrison with
young Jim on the desk another family - his own We look
across the thick desk with the chess set A Complete

Works of William Shakespeare and a Nazi helmet with a bullet
hole in it to Jim himself writing - pen to paper We
sense the quiet intellect of the 43 year old man The clock
ticks in the awful suspended silence

Its as if the air itself has been sucked from the silent
room This is the last moment of peace before the World
will rush through the door in all its sound and fury - to
change his life forever The camera haywires into a close-
up of Jim as he looks up and knows

Lou Ivon Jims chief investigator is already standing there
in the room He is burly in his 30s - his expression
universal for that day

JIM
Whats wrong Lou

LOU

same language as on faces all across America that Black
Friday

JIM

out of the backside but there is no confirmation blood

last rites

JIM

(choked pause)
Vice-President Johnson has left the
hospital in Dallas but we do not

Presumably he will be taking the
oath of office shortly and become
the 36th President of the United
States

There are sounds of shock muttering some sobbing in the
restaurant Lou gulps down his drink Jim sits stunned

JIM
I didnt always agree with him - too
liberal for my tastes - but I
respected him He had style God
Im ashamed to be an American today

He holds back the tears The food comes Lou waves it off
They just sit there

EXTERIOR KATZENJAMMERS BAR - SAME DAY Katzenjammers is an Irish working class bar across Canal

St In a seedy area near the Mississippi River just off

over our heads - from that fence

shaken I saw his face when it hit
he just his ear flew off he turned
just real white and then went stiff
like a board and flopped over on his
stomach with his foot sticking out

CUT TO the picket fence above the Grassy Knoll

Back in the bar the camera moves to two patrons seated at a
table by themselves far enough away not to be heard Guy
Banister is a sturdy imposing ex - FBI agent in his 60s
steel gray hair blue eyes ruddy from heavy drinking He
wears a small rosebud in his lapel Jack Martin is a thin
mousy man in his mid - 50s wearing a Dick Tracy hat

Theyre both drinking Wild Turkey heavily The TV blares
loudly across the room over their voices

BANISTER

drinking watching the tube with the insatiable curiosity
the event engendered People stare in from the street
There is a silence in the restaurant

TELEVISION INSERT image of a Dallas policeman hauling a
Mannlicher - Carcano rifle with a sniperscope over the heads
of the press gathered in the police station

NEWSMAN 3
This is the rifle it is a Mannlicher -
Carcano Italian rifle a powerful
World War II military gun used by
infantry and highly accurate at
distances of 100 yards

We see images of the textbook boxes - the snipers nest in
the sixth story of the Book Depository - and then the view
out the window looking down at Elm Street

NEWSMAN 3
The assassin apparently fired from
this perch but so far no word

much confusion and
CUT TO Newsman 2 at a different location or in studio

The room bursts out with an accumulated fury at the young
Oswald - a tremendous release of tension On the TV we see
the excitement in the newsmens eyes they all sense that
this is the break theyre looking for in the case

Garrison and Ivon watch the TV and then Garrison stands and
pays the bill

LOU

Jim moves to the phone as Liz starts the kids up the stairs
The TV cuts to stills of Oswalds life Two newsmen sit in
a studio smoking sharing information

FRANK

(Newsman 7)
So several hours after the
assassination a disturbed portrait
is emerging of Lee Harvey Oswald
Described as shy and introverted he
spent much of his childhood in New
Orleans Louisiana and went to high
school there After a stint in the
Marines he apparently became
fascinated by Communism and in 1959
defected to the Soviet Union

BOB

(Newsman 8)
He married a Russian woman there
Frank had a child and then returned
to the United States after 30 months
But he is still believed to be a
dedicated Marxist and a fanatical
supporter of Fidel Castro and ultra
left wing causes He spent last
summer in New Orleans and was arrested
in a brawl with anti-Castro Cuban
exiles

FRANK
(Newsman 7)
And apparently Bob Oswald had been
passing out pro-Castro pamphlets for
an organization called Fair Play for
Cuba a Communist front he reportedly
belongs to

BOB
(Newsman 8)
And we have Marina Oswald his Russian-
born wife who has identified the
rifle found in the Book Depository
as belonging to her husband And we
have

(on TV)
Lee good man he not shoot anyone

Camera moves to Lou Ivon looking at paperwork

LOU
As far as Oswalds associates boss
the one name that keeps popping up
is David Ferrie

Oswald was seen with him several times last summer

JIM
I know David - a strange character

LOU
Hes been in trouble before Used
to be a hot shot pilot for Eastern
Airlines but he got canned after an
alleged homosexual incident with a
14-year old boy

BILL
(on phone excited)
Get Kohlman he told somebody the
Texas trip yesterday mentioned to
somebody about Ferrie find it
out

On the TV we see the first image of the backyard photos of
Lee Harvey Oswald holding the rifle

NEWSMAN 1
These backyard photos were found
yesterday among Oswalds possessions
in the garage of Janet Williams
home in Riving Texas where Marina
Oswald and her children are living
The picture apparently was taken
earlier this year Police say the
rifle a cheap World War II Italian-
made Mannlicher-Carcano was ordered
from a Chicago mailing house and
shipped to Oswalds alias A Hidell
at a post office box in March 1963
This is the same rifle that was used
to assassinate the President

The camera moves back to the staff who watch obviously
influenced

COX
That ties it up

NUMA
Another nut Jesus anybody can get
a rifle in Texas

BILL
(hangs up)
So it seems that Dave Ferrie drove
off on a Friday afternoon for Texas -
a source told Kohlman he might have
been a getaway pilot for Oswald

Members of the team exchange looks of surprise and disbelief

JIM
Hold your horses What kinda source

BILL
(grins)
The anonymous kind Chief

OSER
I think I remember this guy Ferrie
speaking at a meeting of some
veterans group Ranting against
Castro Extreme stuff

NEWSMAN 1
We go back now to the basement of
police headquarters where theyre
about to transfer Oswald to County
Prison

TELEVISION IMAGE The basement of the Dallas police
headquarters - waiting Men mill around as Oswald is led

out of the basement by two deputies Jack Ruby rushes forward
out of the crowd - and into history - putting his sealing
bullet into Oswald Total chaos erupts

The camera is on the staff looking We hear gasps

ANNOUNCER
Hes been shot Oswalds been shot

VARIOUS VOICES
Goddamn Look at that Look at
that I dont believe this Right
on TV What is going on Who is
this guy oh Jesus

Jim is silent

LOU
Seventy cops in that basement What
the hell were they doing

NEWSMAN 1
Jack Ruby Who is Jack Ruby Oswald
is hurt

We see images of Oswald being lifted onto the stretcher
into the ambulance and the newscaster crouching whispering

Everybody in the room is stunned still

LOU
Well no trial now Looks like
somebody saved the Dallas DA a
pile of work

They look to Jim Theres a pause He is deeply disturbed

JIM
(quietly)
Well lets get Ferrie in here anyway

GARRISON OFFICE - NEXT DAY - DAY The portable television plays to Jim alone sitting in his
chair smoking a pipe We see searing images of the funeral -
crowds of mourners the casket being driven through the
streets the honor guards the horses the dignitaries walking
behind Jackie veiled the faces of De Gaulle MacMillan
Robert Kennedy We intercut briefly to Lyndon Johnson sitting
down earlier that day with the Joint Chiefs of Staff and
then a future cut to Johnson in the Oval Office (staged)

The shots are very tight uncomfortable - noses eyes hands -
very tight

As the door opens following a knock David Ferrie is brought
into Jims office by two police officers and Lou Ivon Jim
stands up cordial

LOU
Chief David Ferrie

Ferrie suffers from alopecia a disease that has removed all
his body hair and he looks like a Halloween character -
penciled eyebrows one higher than the other a scruffy
reddish wig pasted on askew with glue thrift store clothing
His eyes however are swift and cunning his smile warm
inviting itself his demeanor hungry to please

JIM
(shakes hands)
Come in Dave Have a seat make
yourself comfortable Coffee

FERRIE
Do you remember me Mr Garrison I
met you on Carondolet Street right
after your election I congratulated
you remember

JIM

How could I forget You make quite
a first impression

(on intercom)
Sharon could you please bring us
some coffee

(Ferrie laughs pause)
Ive heard over the years youre
quite a first-rate pilot Dave
Legend has it you can get in and out
of any field no matter how small
(Jim points to the
pictures on his wall
Im a bit of a pilot myself you
know Flew grasshoppers for the
field artillery in the war

Ferrie glimpses the low-volumed TV - and images of the
funeral He looks away jittery and takes out a cigarette
Sharon brings the coffee in

FERRIE
Do you mind if I smoke Mr Garrison

JIM

(holds up his pipe)
How could I Dave as you know
President Kennedy was assassinated
on Friday A man named Lee Harvey
Oswald was arrested as a suspect and
then was murdered yesterday by a man
named Jack Ruby
(on each name watching
Ferries reaction)
Weve heard reports that Oswald spent
the summer in New Orleans and weve
been advised you knew Oswald pretty
well

FERRIE
ats not true I never met anybody
named Oswald Anybody who told you
that has to be crazy

JIM
But you are aware he served in your
Civil Air Patrol unit when he was a

teenager
FERRIE
No if he did I dont remember
him There were lots of kids in and
out yknow
JIM
(hands him a current
newspaper)

Im sure youve seen this Perhaps
you knew this man under another name

FERRIE
No I never saw him before in my
life
JIM

Well that mustve been mistaken
information we got Thanks for
straightening it out for us

(puffs on pipe Ferrie

looks relieved images

of the funeral

continue on the TV)
There is one other matter thats
come up Dave We were told you
took a trip to Texas shortly after
the assassination of Friday

FERRIE
Yeah now thats true I drove to
Houston

JIM
What was so appealing about Houston

FERRIE
I hadnt been there ice skating in
many years and I had a couple of
young friends with me and we decided
we wanted to go ice skating

JIM
Dave may I ask why the urge to go
ice skating in Texas happened to
strike you during one of the most
violent thunderstorms in recent
memory

FERRIE
Oh it was just a spur of the moment
thing the storm wasnt that bad
JIM

I see And where did you drive

FERRIE
We went straight to Houston and
then Saturday night we drove to
Galveston and stayed over there

JIM
Why Galveston

FERRIE
No particular reason Just to go
somewhere

JIM
And then Sunday

FERRIE
In the morning we went goose hunting
Then headed home but I dropped the
boys off to see some relatives and I
stayed in Hammond

JIM
Did you bag any geese on this trip

FERRIE
I believe the boys got a couple

JIM
But the boys told us they didnt get
any

FERRIE

(fidgeting lighting

another cigarette)
Oh yes well come to think of it
theyre right We got to where the
geese were and there were thousands
of them But you couldnt approach
them They were a wise bunch of
birds

JIM
Your young friends also told us you
had no weapons in the car Dave
isnt it a bit difficult to hunt for
geese without a shotgun

FERRIE
Yes now I remember Mr Garrison
Im sorry I got confused We got
out there near the geese and it was
only then we realized wed forgotten
our shotguns Stupid right So of
course we didnt get any geese

JIM

I see

(stands up)
Dave thank you for your time Im
sorry it has to end inconveniently
for you but Im going to have you
detained for further questioning by
the FBI

FERRIE
(shaken)
Why Whats wrong

JIM
Dave I find your story simply not
believable
Lou and the two cops escort Ferrie out of the office as Jim
turns to the television image of Kennedys final moments of
rest The bugler plays taps John Jr 3 years old in an
image which will become famous salutes his Dad farewell
The riderless horse stands lonely against the Washington
sky

FBI OFFICE - NEW ORLEANS - NEXT DAY At a small press conference the FBI spokesman reads a
statement

FBI SPOKESMAN
Gentlemen this afternoon the FBI
released David W Ferrie of New
Orleans After extensive questioning
and a thorough background check the
Bureau found no evidence that

GARRISONS OFFICE - SIMULTANEOUS WITH PREVIOUS SCENE

In Garrisons office see the same broadcast on the portable
television Lou Broussard Numa and Jim watch

FBI SPOKESMAN

(on TV)
Mr Ferrie knew Lee Harvey Oswald
or that he has had any connection
with the assassination of President
Kennedy The Special Agent in Charge
would like to make clear that Mr
Ferrie was brought in for questioning
by the District Attorney of Orleans
parish not by the Federal Bureau of
Investigation The Bureau regrets
any trouble this may have caused Mr
Ferrie

NEWSMAN 9
In national news President Johnson
has announced the creation of a blue
ribbon presidential commission to
probe the events in Dallas

Lou looks at Jim angry

LOU
Correct me if Im wrong I thought
we were on the same side What the
hell business is it of theirs to say
that

BILL
Pretty fast wasnt it The way
they let him go
JIM
They must know something we dont
(dismisses it)
So lets get on with our lives
gentlemen we got plenty of home
grown crimes to prosecute

He reaches to turn off the TV and get back to work The
last image on the TV is

NEWSMAN 9
The Commission will be headed by
Chief Justice of the United States
Supreme Court Earl Warren and is
expected to head off several
Congressional and Texas inquiries
into the assassination On the panel
are Allen Dulles ex-chief of the
CIA Representative Gerald Ford
John J McCloy former head of Chase
Manhattan Bank

Jim flicks the TV off as the overture ends
AERIAL SHOT - WASHINGTON DC - DAY We look down at the White House from the planes point of
view A subtitle reads THREE YEARS LATER

INTERIOR OF PLANE

SENATOR RUSSELL LONG
(looking out the window)
Thats a mess down there Jim Weve
bitten off more Vietnam that we
can possibly chew

Jim now 46 reads the front page of THE WASHINGTON POST
which details the latest battle in Vietnam He sits next to
Senator Long from Louisiana in his 50s whos drinking a
whiskey Theyre on a crowded businessmans shuttle We
see a close-up of a newspaper article about the Vietnam war
more troops asked by Westmoreland

LONG

(continuing)
Sad thing is the way its screwing
up this country all these hippies
running around on drugs the way
young people look you cant tell a
boy from a girl anymore I saw a
girl the other day she was pregnant -
you could see her whole belly and
you know what she painted on it
Love Child Its fuckin outa
control Valuesve gone to hell
Jim Course it figures when you
got somebody like that polecat Johnson
in the White House

JIM
I sometimes feel thingsve gone
downhill since John Kennedy was
killed Senator

LONG
Dont get me started on that Those
Warren Commission fellows were pickin
gnat shit out of pepper No ones
gonna tell me that kid did the
shooting job he did from that damned
bookstore

STEWARDESS
Here you go Senator Long

The stewardess brings more drinks

JIM
(surprised)
I thought the FBI test-fired the
rifle to make sure it could be done

LONG
Sure three experts and not one of
them could do it Theyre telling
us Oswald got off three shots with
world-class precision from a manual
bolt action rifle in less than six
seconds - and accordin to his Marine
buddies he got Maggies drawers - he
wasnt any good Average man would
be lucky to get two shots off and I
tell ya the first shot would always
be the best Here the third shots
perfect Dont make sense And
then they got that crazy bullet
zigzagging all over the place so it
hits Kennedy and Connally seven times
One pristine bullet That dog
dont hunt

JIM
You know something always bothered
me about that from day one and I
cant put my finger on it

LONG
If I were investigatin Id round
up the 100 best riflemen in the world
and find out which ones were in Dallas
that day You been duck hunting I
think Oswald was a good old-fashioned
decoy Whatd he say Im just a
patsy Out of the mouth of babes
yask me

JIM
You think there were other men
involved Russell

Russell looks at Jim quizzically and laughs

LONG
Hell youre the District Attorney
You read the Warren Report - and
then you tell me youre satisfied
Lee Oswald shot the President all by
his lonesome

JIM
Russell honestly you sound like one
of those kooky critics spreading
paranoia like prairie fire I just
cant believe the Chief Justice of
the United States would put his name
on something that wasnt true

LONG
(to the stewardess)

Honey another one of these This
ones as weak as cricket pee-pee
Yessir you mark my words Jim
Vietnams gonna cost Johnson 68 and
its gonna put that other varmint
Nixon in - then watch your hide
cause there aint no offramps on a
freeway to Hell

GARRISONS STUDY - NIGHT The study is lined with bookshelves up to the ceiling we
see photos of family a chess set Jim smoking his pipe
reads in a red leather chair from one of the 26 thick Warren
Commission volumes piled all over the place Liz enters
Jasper now 7 draws on a piece of paper on the floor at
Jims feet

LIZ
Jim dinners just about ready
Ive got a surprise for you tried
something new Jim Jim dinner
JIM
(lost in thought)
Mmmmm sure smells good but

Egghead do you realize Oswald was
interrogated for twelve hours after
the assassination with no lawyer
present and nobody recorded a word
of it I cant believe it A police
captain with 30 years experience and
a crowd of Federal agents just had

to know that with no record anything
that Oswald said would be inadmissible
in court

LIZ
Come on now well talk about it at
the table dinners getting cold
(to Jasper)
What are you doing in here

JASPER
Daddy said it was all right if I was
real quiet

JIM
(rising to dinner)
Sure it is Freckle Face if I ever
handled a minor felon like that
itd be all over the papers Id
catch hell And this is the alleged
murderer of the President

GARRISON DINING ROOM - Two-year-old Elizabeth watches Crusader Rabbit on TV as

the new one-year-old sits in diapers with Liz at one end of
the dinner table Jim sits at the other end There are

five kids now ages 7 5 4 2 and 1 and Mattie the
housekeeper Dinners finished they pass plates the
children horse around the boxer dog Touchdown begs for

a piece of the action Jim not a big eater feeds him ice
cream

JIM
Again and again they ignore credible
testimony leads are never followed
up its conclusions are selective
theres no index its one of the
sloppiest most disorganized
investigations Ive ever seen Dozens
and dozens of witnesses in Dealey
Plaza that day are saying they heard
shots coming from the Grassy Knoll
area in front of Kennedy and not the
Book Depository behind him but its
all broken down and spread around
and you read it and the point gets
lost

MATTIE
I never did believe it either
LIZ
(politely listening)
Uh huh Mattie Ill do the dishes
you take Be up now And Elizabeth
too your bedtime honey

ELIZABETH JR
Nahhhh I dont wanna go to bed

LIZ
Honey that was three years ago - we
all tried so hard to put that out of
our minds why are you digging it up
again Youre the DA of New
Orleans Isnt the Kennedy
assassination a bit outside your
domain I mean all those important
people already studied it

JIM
I cant believe a man as intelligent
as Earl Warren ever read whats in
those volumes

LIZ

Well maybe youre right Jim Ill
give you one hour to solve the case
until the kids are in bed

(rising she puts her

arms around him from

behind and kisses

his ear)
Then youre mine and Mr Kennedy can
wait til morning Come on everybody

JASPER
(showing his drawing)
Dad look what I drew

JIM
(rising)

JASPER
A rhinoceros Can I stay up another
hour

Virginia and Snapper each get one of Jims shoes as he dances
with them holding one with each hand

JIM
(dancing)
Pickle and Snapper my two favorite
dancing partners

As the children dance they fall off Jims feet laughing
and giggling He throws each in the air and kisses them

JIM
Goodnight my doodle bugs

KIDS

Liz comes over smiling Jim takes her in his arms

LIZ
One hour yhear Some Saturday
night date you are
(sighs)
Mama warned me this would happen if
I married such a serious man

JIM
Oh she did huh When I come up
Ill show you how Saturday night got
invented

GARRISON STUDY - LATER THAT NIGHT The clock on mantelpiece reads 3 AM Jim is alone smoking
his pipe

In the stillness his mind crawls all over the place The
camera closes on the thickly-worded pages of the Warren
Report

FLASHBACK TO the Warren Commission hearing room in Dallas
1964 We hear thin echoey sound as the attorneys question
some of the witnesses

The overall effect is vague and confusing as is much of the
Warren Report A Mr Ball is questioning Lee Bowers the
switchman in the railroad yard Bowers in his early 40s
has a trustworthy working-man face and a crew cut

BOWERS
I sealed off the area and I held
off the trains until they could be
examined and there was some
transients taken on at least one
train

ATTORNEY
Mr Bowers is there anything else
you told me I havent asked you about
that you can think of

BOWERS
Nothing that I can recall

ATTORNEY
Witness is excused

Jim upset reads on Another witness Sgt DV Harkness
of the Dallas Police responds to a second attorney

SGT HARKNESS
Well we got a long freight that was
in there and we pulled some people
off of there and took them to the
station

We see another FLASHBACK - to the Dallas rail yards on the
day of the assassination Three hoboes are being pulled off
the freight by the Dallas policemen

ATTORNEY (VO)
You mean some transients

SGT HARKNESS (VO)
Tramps and hoboes

ATTORNEY (VO)
Were all those questioned

FLASHBACK TO Dealey Plaza an hour or less after the
assassination The three hoboes are marched by shotgun-toting
policemen to the Sheriffs office at Dealey Plaza We note
that they do not look much like hoboes

SGT HARKNESS (VO)
Yes sir they were taken to the
station and questioned

JIM
(astounded)
And
(writes incomplete)

ATTORNEY (V0O)
(switching subjects)
I want to go back to this Amos Euins
(voices dribble off)

BOWERS (VO)
Yes sir traffic had been cut off
into the area since about 10 but
there were three cars came in during
this time from around noon till the
time of the shooting the cars
circled the parking lot and left
like they were checking the area
one of the drivers seemed to have
something he was holding to his
mouth the last car came in about
7 to 10 minutes before the shooting
a white Chevrolet 4-door Impala
muddy up to the windows

The cameras point of view is now from the railroad tower
near Dealey Plaza We are fourteen feet off the ground
overlooking the parking lot behind the Grassy Knoll The
shot includes this last car circling in the lot

BOWERS

Towards the underpass I saw two men
standing behind a picket fence
they were looking up towards Main

and Houston and following the caravan
as it came down One of them was
middle-aged heavyset The other

man was younger wearing a plaid
shirt and jacket

Inside the railroad tower Bowers glances out busy with the
main board flashing lights a train coming in

BOWERS
There were two other men on the
eastern end of the parking lot
Each of me had uniforms

We see the parking lot from Bowers point of view - at a
distance but we have a sense of the cars and see the men at
a distance tow uniformed men The parking lot is bumper-to-
bumper with a sea of cars Rain that morning has muddied

the lot These brief images are elaborated on later

BOWERS
At the time of the shooting there
seemed to be some commotion I

just am unable to describe - a flash
of light or smoke or something which
caused me to feel that something out
of the ordinary had occurred there
on the embankment

We feel the growing intensity music drums - but all blurred
We see a puff of smoke but no sound because of the window
Bowers is glancing through A motorcycle cop shoots up the
Grassy Knoll incline People run blurring into a larger
mosaic of confusion Bowers is confused seeing this

INTERCUT with Jims heart pounding as he reads

Back in Dealey Plaza SM Holland an elderly signal
supervisor stands on the parapet of the railway

HOLLAND (VO)
Four shots a puff of smoke came
from the trees behind that picket
fence close to the little plaza -
Theres no doubt whatever in my mind

We see the scene from Hollands point of view - the puff of
smoke lingering under the trees along the picket fence after
the shooting

GARRISON BEDROOM - ANOTHER NIGHT Jim is asleep having a tortured dream

DREAMSCAPE FLASHBACK We see the Zapruder film in slow-motion
and JFKs face just before he goes behind Stemmons Freeway
sign Jim sits up suddenly

JIM
NO

Liz stirs shaken

LIZ
Honey you all right
(looks at watch)

JIM
Its incredible honey - the whole
thing A Lieutenant Colonel testifies
that Lee Oswald was given a Russian
language exam as part of his Marine
training only a few months before he
defects to the Soviet Union A
Russian exam

LIZ
(sitting up angered)
I cannot believe this Its four-
thirty Jim Garrison I have five
children are gonna be awake in another
hour and

JIM
Honey in all my years in the service
I never knew a single man who was
given a Russian test Oswald was a
radar operator Hed have about as
much use for Russian as a cat has
for pajamas

LIZ
These books are getting to your mind
Mr Garrison I wish youd stop
readin them

JIM
And then this Colonel tries to make
it sound like nothing Oswald did

badly on the test he says He
only had two more Russian words right
than wrong Ha Thats like me

saying Touchdown here

(points to the dog)
is not very intelligent because I
beat him three games out of five the
last time we played chess

LIZ

(gives up)
Jim what is going on for heavens
sake You going to stay up all night
every night For what So youll
be the only man in America who read
the entire 26 volumes of the Warren
Report

JIM
Liz do I have to spell it out for
you Lee Oswald was no ordinary
soldier That was no accident he
was in Russia He was probably in
military intelligence Thats why
he was trained in Russian

LIZ
(with a quizzical
look)
Honey go back to sleep please

JIM
Goddammit I been sleeping for three
years

She takes him now gently and pulls him down on top of her
and kisses him

LIZ
Will you stop rattling on about
Kennedy for a few minutes honey
come on

LAFAYETTE SQUARE - NEW ORLEANS - MORNING A Sunday early We see a statue of Ben Franklin in an empty
square frequented by drunks who doze on benches in a little
leafy park in the center of the Square The camera moves to
Jim by himself and then moves to a sedan pulling up which
disgorges Lou Ivon and Bill Broussard

JIM
Morning boys Ready for a walking
tour
BILL
At 730 Sunday morning Its not
exactly fresh blood were sniffing
here boss

JIM
(points)
Old stains Bill but just as telling

TIME CUT TO Jim indicating 531 Lafayette Street a seedy
faded three-story building across the street from the square

JIM
Remember whose office this was back
in 63 531 Lafayette Street

LOU
Yeah Guy Banister Ex-FBI man He
died couple years ago

FLASHBACK TO the exterior of the Banister Office on a day in
1963 The door is now clearly labelled W GUY BANISTER
INC INVESTIGATORS It opens and Banister comes out in

slow motion neatly dressed rose in his lapel - the same
office and same man we saw three years before when he pistol-
whipped Jack Martin Banister seems to be smiling right at
us greeting us

JIM (VO)
Headed the Chicago office When he
retired he became a private eye here
I used to have lunch with him John
Birch Society Minutemen slightly
to the right of Attila the Hun
Used to recruit college students to
infiltrate radical organizations on
campus All out of this office
Now come around here take a look at
this

Back to the Lafayette Square of 1966 Jim walks Ivon and
Bill to the corner to another entrance to the same building -
this one with a sign that says 544 Camp Street

JIM
544 Camp Street Same building as
531 Lafayette right but different

address and different entrances both
going to the same place - the offices
on the second and third floors

Bill studies the present sign Crescent City Dental
Laboratory and gives Jim a puzzled look

JIM
Guess who used this address
Lou gets it and glances up We FLASHBACK TO the exterior of
544 Camp Street in 1963 Lee Oswald comes out the door into
a full close-up now clearly seen by us and heads out into
the street as Guy Banister intercepts him on the sidewalk
holding a leaflet and point to 544 Camp Street stamped on
it Guy seems miffed at Oswald tells him something quickly
and then moves on

BANISTER
(under)
See this What the hell is this
doing on this piece of paper
(he moves away)
Asshole

LOU (VO)
My God Lee Harvey Oswald

JIM (VO)

Bulls-eye How do we know he was
here Cause this office address was
stamped on the pro-Casto leaflets he
was handing out in the summer of 63
down on Canal street They were the
same leaflets that were found in his
garage in Dallas

FLASHBACK to Canal Street in New Orleans on a summer day in
1963 Oswald in a thin tie and white short-sleeved shirt
and wearing a homemade placard reading Hands Off Cuba
Viva Fidel is hawking leaflets to pedestrians with two
young helpers

A large white-haired businessman in a white suit very
distinguished walks with a friend on Canal Street Oswald
glances at him and meets his eyes The businessman enters
an office building This man is Clay Bertrand later known
as Clay Shaw

Some Cubans led by Carols Bringuier now appear One of
them the Bull is heavy-set with dark glasses More of
him will also be seen

JIM
He was arrested that day for fighting
with some anti-Castro Cubans but

actually he had contacted them a few
days earlier as an ex-Marine trying
to join the anti-Castro crusade

When they heard he was now pro-Castro
they paid him a visit

CARLOS
(haranguing passerby)
Hes a traitor this man Dont
believe a word he tells you

(to Oswald)
You sonofabitch you liar youre a
Communist go back to Moscow

Carlos throws Oswalds leaflets in the air and pulls off his
glasses prepared to fight Oswald only smiles and puts
his arms down in an X of passivity

OSWALD
Okay Carlos if you want to hit me
hit me

There is no real fight but the police as if pre-alerted
arrive

Arrests are made We see Oswald in a room in the police
station talking with FBI Agent John Quigley A calendar on
the wall shows that its August 1963

JIM (VO)
There was no real fight and the
arresting Lieutenant later said he
felt it was a staged incident In
jail Oswald asked to talk to Special
Agent John Quigley of the FBI who
showed up immediately They have a
private session Oswald is released
and Quigley destroys his notes from
the interview

In a television studio in 1963 Oswald debates Carlos
Bringuier with two moderators

JIM
But the arrest gets hima lot of
publicity and as a result Oswald
appears on a local TV debate that
established his credentials as a
Communist

BRINGUIER
But youre a Communist are you not
and you defected to Russia

OSWALD
No I am not a Communist But I am
a Marxist-Leninist

BRINGUIER
What did you do when you were in
Russia

OSWALD
(defensive)
I worked while I was there I was
always under the protection of
that is to say I was not under the
protection of the US Government

Back in 1966 Jim walks with his two assistants

BILL
What the hells a Communist like Lee
Oswald doing working out of
Banisters

JIM

Yever heard of a double agent Bill
Im beginning to doubt Oswald was
ever a Communist after the arrest
544 Camp Street never appeared on

the pamphlets again Now heres
another one for you What would you
say if I told you Lee Oswald had
been trained in the Russian language
when he was a Marine

LOU
Id say he was probably getting
intelligence training

JIM
Lou you were in the Marines Who
would be running that training

LOU
The Office of Naval Intelligence

JIM
Take a look across the street

We see the Post Office building across the street

LOU
Post Office

JIM
Upstairs In 1963 that was the Office
of Naval Intelligence - And just by
coincidence Banister before he was
FBI was ONI What do they say

LOU
Once ONI always ONI

BILL
Well he likes to work near his old

pals

Jim makes a gesture encompassing the whole Square
JIM
Bill Lou were standing in the
heart of the United States
Governments intelligence community
in New Orleans Thats the FBI there
the CIA Secret Service ONI Doesnt
this seem to you a rather strange
place for a Communist to spend his
spare time

LOU
What are you driving at boss

JIM

Were going back into the case Lou -
the murder of the President I want
you to take some money from the Fees
and Fines Account and go to Dallas -
talk to some people Bill I want
you to get Oser on the medical the
autopsy Susan on Oswald and Ruby
histories tax records

BILL
Lord wake me please I must be
dreaming

JIM

No youre awake Bill and Im dead
serious And were going to start

by tracking down your anonymous source
from three years ago How did you
find out Dave Ferrie drove to Texas
that day

RACETRACK - DAY A straggly group of people watch from the grandstands eating
hotdogs and talking in small clusters The horses are running
early morning laps Three men sit apart in the bleachers

A scared Jack Martin three years older than when last seen
still wearing the Dick Tracy hat sucks up coffee like a

worm does moisture He has the red puffy cheeks of an
alcoholic and deeply circled worried eyes Bill and Jim
wait

JIM
Youre not under cross-examination
here Jack

What I need is a little clarification about the night Guy
Banister beat you over the head with his Magnum You called
our office hopping mad from your hospital bed Dont tell
me you dont remember that

Jack looks away and doesnt respond
JIM
Heres my problem Jack You told
me you and Guy were good friends for
a long time

MARTIN
More than ten years

JIM
And he never hit you before

MARTIN
Never touched me

JIM

Yet on November 22 1963 - the day
of the Presidents murder - our police
report says he pistol-whipped you
with a 357 Magnum

(Martins eyes are

fixed on Jim)
But the police report says you had
an argument over the phone bill
Here take a look at it

(Martin looks at the

report)
Now does a simple argument over
phone bills sound like a believable
explanation to you

SUDDEN FLASHBACK to the night of the pistol-whipping The
camera shows Banister laying Martins head open the beating
the humiliation

MARTIN
(shaking his head
slowly dreamily)
No it involved more than that

Bill looks at Jim

JIM
How much more

MARTIN
(waits)
I dont know if I should talk about
this
JIM

Well Id ask Guy - we were friendly
you know - heart attack wasnt it

MARTIN
If you buy what you read in the paper
JIM
You have other information

MARTIN
I didnt say that All I know is he
died suddenly just before the Warren
Report came out

JIM
Why did Guy beat you Jack

MARTIN
Well I guess now that Guys dead
it dont really matter it was

about the people hanging around the
office that summer I wasnt really
part of the operation you know I
was handling the private-eye work
for Guy when that came in - not much
did - but thats why I was there
it was a nuthouse There were all
these Cubans coming and going They
all looked alike to me

FLASHBACK to Banisters office in 1963 There are Cubans in
battle fatigues and combat boots duffle bags are lying
around David Ferrie in fatigues directs the Cubans as
they carry crates of ammunition and weapons into a back room
Martin observes from another desk

MARTIN
Dave Ferrie - you know about him

JIM (VO)
Was he there often

MARTIN (VO)
Often He practically lived there
It was real cloak and dagger stuff
They called it Operation Mongoose
The idea was to train all these Cuban
exiles for another invasion of Cuba
Banisters office was part of a supply
line that ran from Dallas through
New Orleans to Miami stockpiling
arms and explosives

Still in 1963 we see the exterior of Banisters office A
dozen Cubans follow Ferrie downstairs into the street and
pile into several cars duffels thrown in with them Ferrie
drives the lead car

JIM (VO)
All this right under the noses of
the intelligence community in
Lafayette Square

We see the cars cross the long Lake Pontchartrain Bridge and
enter a remote guerrilla training camp Bayou and jungle
are all around

MARTIN (VO)
Sure Everybody knew everybody It
was a network They were working
for the CIA - pilots black operations
guys Civilians military - everybody
in those days was running guns
somewhere Fort Jefferson Bayou
Bluff Morgan City McAllen Texas
was a big gun-running operation

At the guerrilla training camp at Lake Pontchartrain in 1963
we see scenes of basic training - shooting obstacle courses
callisthenics - led by Ferrie and other trainers Scattered
among the Cubans are several white American mercenaries We
catch a glimpse of Oswald and glimpses of several other men
we will see again in sprinklings

JIM (VO)
Where is Banister in all this

MARTIN (VO)
Banister was running his camp north
of Lake Pontchartrain Ferrie handled
a lot of the training There was a
shooting range and a lot of tropical
terrain like in Cuba A few Americans
got trained too Nazi types
Mercenaries But Ferrie was the
craziest

Its night at the training camp FBI agents race up in cars
in the middle of the night swarming over the camp rounding
up the trainees

MARTIN
Anyway late summer the party ended
Kennedy didnt want another Bay of
Pigs mess so he ordered the FBI to
shut down the camps and confiscate
the napalm and the C-4 There were
a buncha Cubans and a couple Americans
arrested only you didnt read about
it in the papers Just the weapons
got mentioned cause the first
ones behind bars wouldve been
Banister and Ferrie but I think the
G-men were just going through the
motions for Washington Their hearts
were with their old FBI buddy
Banister
We see FBI agents loading dynamite bomb casings arms
artillery shells etc

Back at the racetrack in 1966 Jim listens

MARTIN
Like I said a fuckin nuthouse

JIM
And Oswald

155mm

Martin hesitates We hear the rhythmic beating of the horse
hooves and Martin sucking on the steaming cup of coffee

MARTIN
(finally)
Yeah he was there too sometimes
hed be meeting with Banister with
the door shut Other times hed be
shooting the bull with Ferrie But
he was there all right

JIM
Anything more specific Jack Its
important

FLASHBACK TO Banisters office in 1963 Banister and Martin

shooting the breeze as the straight-laced middle-aged
secretary Delphine Roberts hurries in

MARTIN (VO)
Yeah one time the secretary got
upset I remember

SECRETARY
I cant believe it Mr Banister
Lee Oswald is down on Canal Street
giving out Communist leaflets
supporting Castro

Banister just looks at her and laughs

BANISTER
Its okay Delphine hes with us

Back at the racetrack

JIM
Anyone else involved at Banisters
level

MARTIN
(shrugs)
There was one guy I dont know big
guy business guy white hair - I
saw him come into the office once
He looked out of place yknow -
like a society guy Cant remember
his name

(thinking)
Oswald was with him

FLASHBACK to Banisters office on a day in 1963 Martin is
snooping in Banisters files Cut to Martin leaving the
office as a big businessman with white hair briefly talks to
Oswald and then goes into Banisters private office

MARTIN
He had something to do with money
I remember him cause Guy who didnt
kiss anybodys ass sure kissed his

Banister lets the man into his private office

MARTIN
Clay something that was his name -
Clay

JIM

Bertrand Clay Bertrand

MARTIN
Yeah Thats it
(pause paranoid)
I dont know Maybe it wasnt I
gotta go

JIM
(to Bill)
Clay Bertrand Hes in the Warren
Report He tried to get Oswald a
lawyer
(to Martin)
Was Kennedy ever discussed Jack

MARTIN
Sure Course they hated the
sonofabitch but

JIM
The assassination Jack

MARTIN
(tightens)
Never Not with me sir never
Listen I think Id better go I
said enough I said all Im going
to say
(rises suddenly)

JIM
Hold on Jack Whats the problem

MARTIN
Whats the problem Whats the
problem Do I need to spell it out
for you Mr Garrison I better go

JIM
Nobody knows what were talking about
Jack

MARTIN

Youre so naive mister
Martin picks his way nervously down the bleacher benches
CAR - FRENCH QUARTER - DAY Jim drives with Numa in the front and Bill in the back

BILL
Well its a terrific yard Chief
but the mans an obvious alcoholic
with a reputation lower than crocodile
piss

JIM
Does that bother you Bill I always
wondered in court why it is because
a woman is a prostitute she has to
have bad eyesight

BILL
Hell never sign a statement boss
let alone get on a witness stand

JIM
When somethings rotten in the land
Bill it generally isnt just one
fish well get corroboration
find this Clay Bertrand If I were
a betting man Id give you 10 to 1
its an alias Start checking around
the Quarter

BILL
And the six of us with almost no
budget and in secret are going to
solve the case that the Warren
Commission with dozens of support
staff and millions of dollars couldnt
solve We cant keep up with the
crimes in the Parish as it is Chief

JIM
The murder of a President Bill is
a crime in Orleans Parish too I
didnt pick you because of your legal
skill you know

BILL
Gee thanks boss

Jim pulls the car over to park

JIM
But because youre a fighter I
like a man who isnt scared of bad
odds

FRENCH QUARTER SIDEWALK - DAY Jim and the others get out of the car and head towards
Antoines Restaurant A black woman greets him

BLACK WOMAN
How ya doing Mr Garrison Remember
me - from the piano bar at the Royal
Orleans

JIM
I sure do We sang Youre the Cream
in My Coffee

She laughs Others move in on him

JIM
(to Numa)
Make sure we come back here now

ANTOINES RESTAURANT - DAY They enter a busy lunchtime crowd in an elegant eatery Lou
Ivon and Al Oser are waiting for them as theyre shown to
their table by the Maitre d

MAITRE D
Mr Garrison we have not seen enough
of you lately

JIM
Been too busy Paul - an elected man
cant have as much fun as he used
to
(seeing Lou and Al)
Welcome back Lou Find out anything
on those hobos

Lous been waiting excited He gives Jim blowups of the
five hobo photographs

LOU
They took em to the Sheriffs office
not the police station and they let
em go No record of them ever being

questioned

JIM
I cant say that comes as a surprise
anymore

LOU

A photographer from The Dallas Times
Herald got some great shots of them
never published

The camera moves in on the photographs

FLASHBACK TO the hoboes being escorted to the Sheriffs
office - as per Sgt Harkness earlier description

LOU

take a good look chief do any
of em look like the hoboes you
remember

JIM

Hoboes I knew of old used to sleep
in their clothes - these two look
pretty young

LOU
-not a single frayed collar or
cuff new haircuts fresh shaves
clean hands - new shoe leather
Look at the ear of the cop Thats
a wire Whats a cop wearing a
headset for I think theyre actors
chief theyre not cops

Susie Cox arrives
JIM

Who the hell are they then Hi
Susie sit down

(to Lou)
This could be it Lets start looking
for ‘em

How bout that railroad man Lee Bowers Saw those men at
the picket fence

LOU
Graveyard dead August this year
(Jim curses quietly)
A single car accident on an empty
road in Midlothian Texas The doctor
said he was in some kind of strange
shock when he died
(pause)

JIM
(shares the look)
We need to find more witnesses Lou

LOU
There was Rose Cheramie A whore
Two Cubans threw her out of a car on
the way to Dallas

She talked to a cop from a hospital bed two days before the
assassination said Kennedy would be hit that Friday She
said she was a dope runner for Jack Ruby and that Ruby knew
Oswald for years

JIM
Can we find her

LOU
Graveyard dead near Big Sandy Texas
in 65 Two in the morning on some

highway A hit and run
FLASHBACK to Rose lying dead on an empty highway

BILL
Why not go right to the horses mouth
chief

Jack Rubys been rotting in a Dallas jail cell for three
years Maybe hes ready to crack

JIM
If we go to him our investigationll
hit the front pages by sunrise
Blow up right in our face Ruby was
just given a new trial If he has
something to say itll be there
Susie what did you find out on
Oswald

SUSIE

Negative on his tax records
Classified First time I know a
DA cant get a tax record I put
together a list of all the CIA files
on Oswald that were part of the Warren
Report and asked for them There
are about 1200 documents

(gives it to Jim who

reads)
Oswald in the USSR in Mexico City
Oswald and the U2 a CIA 201 personnel
file a memo from the Director on
Oswald travel and activities - cant
get one of them All classified as
secret on the grounds of national
security Its real strange

BILL
Maybe theres more to this Susie
The CIAs keeping something from our
enemies

SUSIE
Yes but were talking about a dead
warehouse employee of no political
significance Three years later and
hes still classified They gave us
his grammar school records a study
of his pubic hairs Put it in
context Bill of what we know about
Oswald Lonely kid no father
unstable childhood high school
dropout - wants to grow up and be a
spy joins the Marines at 17 He
learns Russian he acts overtly
Marxist with two other marines but
hes stationed at a top secret base
in Japan where U2 spy flights over
Russia originate Hes discharged
from the Marines supposedly because
his mothers sick He stays home 3
days then with a 1500 ticket from
a 203 bank account he goes to
Moscow

FLASHBACK TO Moscow in 1959 We see shots of the city -
strange and eerie black-and-white stills Inside the US
Embassy Oswald slaps his passport on the table with a formal
letter Two consuls attend him

OSWALD
(voice stilted)

I want to renounce my citizenship
and become a Soviet citizen Im
going to make known to them all
information I have concerning the
Marine Corps and my specialty therein
radar operation

SUSIE (V0O)
One of the consuls John McVickar
says Oswalds performance was not
spontaneous - it seemed coached
Oswald gives an interview to a
journalist

Continuing the Moscow flashback we see Oswald talking with
a female journalist in his small room in the Hotel Metropole
Again he sounds robotic

OSWALD
I will never return to the United
States for any reason It isa
capitalist country an exploitive
racist country I ama Marxist since
I was 15 Ive seen poor niggers
and that was a real lesson People
hate because theyre told to hate
like school kids Its the fashion
to hate people in the US

SUSIE (V0O)
The Russians are skeptical - want to
send him back Maybe they suspect
hes a spy He supposedly slashes
his wrists in a suicide attempt so
that theyre forced to keep him and
he disappears for six weeks
presumably with the KGB

We see photos of the city of Minks in Russia Oswald with
various friends and tourists shots of Lee and Marina with a
new baby

SUSIE
Finally they shuttle him to a radio
factory in Minks where he lives as
high on the hog as he ever has -
hes given 5000 rubles a roomy
apartment with a balcony has affairs
with local girls

JIM
Makes sense - hes a spokesman

SUSIE
But he never writes speaks or does
any propaganda for the Russians He
meets Marina whose uncle is a colonel
in Soviet intelligence at a trade
union dance she thinks hes Russian
the way he speaks six weeks later
they marry have a daughter

NUMA
Didnt someone say he didnt speak
good Russian

JIM
Its a contradiction Numa get used
to them The only explanation for
the royal treatment is he did give
them radar secrets Or fake secrets
We see documentary shots of the U2 on Russian soil Francis
Gary Powers The Summit Conference canceled Eisenhower
and Khrushchev

SUSIE (V0O)
I dont know if its coincidence
but Oswald had a top security
clearance and knew about the U2
program from his days at Atsugi Air
Base in Japan Six months after he
arrives in Russia Francis Gary
Powers U2 spy flight goes down in
Russia That plane was untouchable
Powers hinted that Oswald couldve
given the Russians enough data to
hit it As a direct result the
peace summit between Khrushchev and
Eisenhower failed I cant help
thinking of that book Seven Days In
May maybe someone in our military
didnt want the Peace Conference to
happen maybe Oswald was part of
that It gets weirder

BILL
Susie youre an assistant DA
remember Stick to what you can
prove in court

SUSIE

You want facts Bill Okay From
1945 to 59 only two US soldiers
defect to Russia From 59 to 60
seven defect six return one of
them another Marine a month before
Oswald All of them young men made
to seem poor disenchanted

JIM
Dont get sidetracked How does he
get back to the States Thats the
point Does he have any problems

SUSIE
None The State Department issues
him a new passport in 48 hours and
loans him the money to travel Hes
never investigated or charged by the
Navy for revealing classified
information or as far as we know
debriefed by the CIA

JIM
This is a man whose secrets cause us
to change our radar patterns in the
Pacific He shouldve been prosecuted
as a traitor

SUSIE
The FBI finally gets around to talking
to him in Dallas and runs a file on
him as a miscreant Communist type

JIM
But who meets him when he gets off
the boat in New York in June 62

The screen shows photos of New York Empty docks a ship
coming in Wall Street on a Sunday morning - Graphic Weegee-
type black-and-white stills then a photo of Spas T Raikin

SUSIE (V0O)
Spas T Raikin a leading member of
an anti-Communist group

JIM (VO)
And Marina Does she have a problem
getting out

SUSIE (V0O)
None either Its bizarre Its
next to impossible to get Russian
sweethearts out Nor does Lee have
any problem getting a new passport
when he wants to go to Cuba and Russia
in 63 A man who has defected once
already Its crazy

JIM
Dammit it doesnt add up Ordinary
people get blacklisted for leftist
affiliations The State Department
did everything short of dispatching
a destroyer to Minks to insure
Oswalds return Only intelligence
people can come and go like that

FLASHBACK TO a Forth Worth map factory We see Oswald at
work on photo mattes with a Minox spy camera The camera
shows close-ups of maps and then flashes to a hand in the
photographic section We see a close-up of Oswalds head in
a photograph - the same headshot that will be superimposed
on the Oswald photo - and a razor blade cutting mattes

SUSIE (V0O)
The next thing we know hes living
in DallasFt Worth in October 62
working 6 months at Jaggars-Chiles-
Stovall a photographic firm that
contracts to make maps for the US
Army He starts work only days
before the government reveals Russian
missiles in Cuba and the crisis
explodes Oswald may have had access
to missile site footage obtained by
the U2 planes and works alongside a
young man whod been in the Army
Security Agency

JIM
Sort of like Benedict Arnold coming
back to George Washingtons cabinet

SUSIE
Equally incongruous is Oswald becoming
chummy with the White Russian
community of Dallas - all rabid anti-
Communists

FLASHBACK TO Fort Worth in 1963 In Oswalds cheap apartment
seven White Russians including George de Mohrenschildt a
distinguished grey-haired man in his late fifties are
visiting Marina and Oswald bringing old dresses groceries
and toys and milk for the crying baby whose cradle is two
suitcases

SUSIE
His closest friend is an oilman named
George de Mohrenschildt whos about
35 years older than Oswald whos
only 23 and supposedly broke De
Mohrenschildt is a member of the
Dallas Petroleum Club speaks five
languages and was in French Vichy
Intelligence during the War Also
rumoured to have been a Nazi
sympathizer and member of the
Solidarists an international anti-
Communist organization with many
Eastern Europeans and ex-Nazis many
of them brought here by the CIA after
the war many of them involved in
oil and munitions interests in Dallas
and the Southwest You figure it

AL
Whered you get all this Nazi stuff

SUSIE
(hands him a file)
Read it They called it Project
Paperclip

JIM (VO)
This is the guy that keeps turning
up in colonial countries and each
time something strange happens
Coup detats presidents overthrown
He shows up on a “walking tour of
Guatemalas Cuban invasion camps
just before the Bay of Pigs invasion
If we dont know hes CIA lets
circle him very probable - Oswalds
handler

We see Oswald and de Mohrenschildt talking with the others
and a magazine cover with JFK the subject of discussion

OSWALD

I think hes made some mistakes on
Cuba but hes doing a pretty good
job If he succeeds in my opinion
hell be a great President Anda
really attractive one too - open
features great head of hair

(laughs)

SUSIE (V0O)
De Mohrenschildt draws a picture of
Oswald as an intellectual well read
speaks excellent Russian a man who
adored JFK

JIM
Thats scenery Dont get
sidetracked This is the man bottom
line who nailed Oswald to the Warren
Commission as a potentially violent
man and linked him to the rifle

TIME CUT TO Oswalds apartment on a different day in 1963
George de Mohrenschildt points out a Mannlicher-Carcano rifle
in the closet turns to Lee

GEORGE
So Lee what are you taking a potshot
at this week - rabbits or fascists

Lees look is sickly He freezes up
RESUME scene of White Russian gathering in Oswalds apartment

SUSIE
The only Russian that suspects Oswald
of still being a Communist is Anna
Meller But her Russian friend tells
her hes checked with the local
FBI and was told Oswald is all right

Anna Meller one of the guests glances at a copy of Das
Kapital in a pile of books and talks to another Russian man
about it Talking now to Lee and Marina are Janet and Bill
Williams a mid-American couple in their late twenties
freshly minted
SUSIE
The Oswalds are introduced by George
de Mohrenschildt to Janet and Bill
Williams Its through Janet Williams
in October 63 that Lee gets the
warehouse job right smack on Elm
Street at the Book Depository which
is owned by another oilman with ties
to defense and military intelligence

JIM (VO)
Presumably so he can now exercise
his intellect stacking school texts
at 125 an hour

We see Oswald and another man in the Texas School Book
Depository in 1963 They are hauling and stacking school
textbooks - an obviously lower-level job for Oswald after

the map factory We cut ahead to empty graphics of the sealed
off area the window site the cafeteria

SUSIE (V0O)
All I can find out about the Williams
is their tax returns are classified
and that Bill Williams a descendant
of the Cabots of Massachusetts has
links through his family and United
Fruit to the CIA and does classified
work for Bell Helicopter which
requires a security clearance - so
what is Oswald a defector doing
visiting his wife in his house
Williams has a relationship at Bell
with General Walter Dornberger
another one of the Nazis we brought
in after the War for our missile
program He used slave labor to
build the V-2 Rockets for Hitler
before Bell needed him

JIM
I wonder about the Williams Just
where did the first description of
Oswald come from at 1244 No one
knows They claimed it was Brennans
but his description came after 1
PM Who called Somehow the FBIs
been tapping the Williams and picks
up a call between Bell Helicopter
and Janets phone an unidentified
voice saying We both know whos
responsible Who called Whys
the Bureau been tapping them

We see the interior of the Williams home in Irving on a day
in 1963

SUSIE (V0O)
His wife Janet Williams studied
Russian in college and her father
worked for the Agency for
International Development which
works hand in hand with the CIA
She suddenly becomes Marinas best
friend Marina fights often with
Lee about many things - his secrecy
the lack of money She says Lee is
not sexually adequate Lee hits her
on several occasions Bill Williams
convenient separation from Janet
allows Janet to invite Marina to
move into her house in Irving There
Marina and Lee have a second daughter -
while Lee now 24 stores his
belongings in Janets garage and
rents a small room in Dallas under
an alias of OH Lee

We see Marina and Oswald in bed at night in the Williams
house in a tender scene Oswald says goodbye to his child

TIME CUT TO Oswald living in a boarding house It is at
night and he sits in his room alone The housekeeper
Earlene Roberts heavyset white in her 60s comes in and
asks him if he wants to watch some TV with her He declines

SUSIE
When hes arrested Marina buries
him with the public Her description
of him is that of a psychotic and
violent man

FLASHBACK TO Marina on TV a different person from before

MARINA
I do not want to believe but I have
too much facts tell me that Lee
shot Kennedy

JIM (VO)

Yeah after they take her to Six
Flags Inn in Arlington prepare her
for the interviews teach her how
she should answer - and after two
months and 46 interviews she has a
nervous breakdown

(flashback)
Oswald was no angel thats clear
but who was he

BACK TO Antoines Restaurant
BILL
Im lost boss What are we saying
here

JIM
Were saying that when Oswald went
to Russia he was not a real defector
that he was an intelligence agent on
some kind of mission for our
government and he remained one till
the day he died thats what were
saying

BILL
And therefore because Oswald pulled
the trigger the intelligence
community murdered their own commander
in chief Thats what youre saying

JIM
Ill go you one better Maybe Oswald
didnt even pull the trigger Bill
The nitrate test indicates he didnt
even fire a rifle on November 22nd
And on top of that they didnt even
bother to check if the rifle had
been fired that day

BILL
He had his palm print on the weapon

JIM

It went to the goddamn FBI and they
didnt find a goddamn thing It
comes back a week later and one guy
in the Dallas police department
suddenly finds a palm print which
for all I know he couldve taken off
Oswald at the morgue Theres no
chain of evidence Bill And what
about the tow guns actually seen in
the Depository One an Enfield
photographed by a newsman and the
other a Mauser described by Deputy

Weitzman Maybe just maybe Lee
Oswald was exactly what he said he
was Bill - a patsy Take it at

face value Lou Susie Im going
with my gut here Hes got an alias
of Hidell to buy the rifle OH
Lee to rent the room right Whats
in aname right In intelligence
theyre assumed to be fake A name
is sort of like a postbox number a
code - several different people can
use the same name right Then why
cant somebody be using Oswalds
name

We see blank faces around the table

BILL
But why

JIM
To frame him obviously You got to
get in your minds how the hell spooks
think Bill Theyre not ordinary
crooks

LOU
I never could figure out why this
guy orders a traceable weapon to
that post office box when you can go
into any store in Texas give a phony
name and walk out with a cheap rifle
which can never be traced

JIM

Unless he or someone else wants him

to get caught Maybe he never ordered
the weapon Lou Somebody else did
It was picked up at the post office
early morning when Oswalds time

sheet shows him clocked in at his

job Lou come alive These things
are not adding up

BILL
I still have to question what the
legal basis is that supports this
boss Susies stuff is colorful
but

JIM
Lets start making some assumptions
about the man Why would he leave a
path as big as Lee Harvey Oswalds
This is not a thin trail gentlemen
it is a very wide one Who found
the evidence Who set him up Lou
Bill Susie I want you to go back
and check all the sightings of Oswald
in Dallas New Orleans and Mexico in
the summer and fall of 63 - see if
its the same guy

AL
Boss Oswald impersonators Sounds
like James Bond now
JIM
Al you cant tell a mink froma
coonskin unless you see the fur up
close Goddamn Sam If we dont
start reading between the lines here
Yall gotta start thinking ona
different level - like the CIA does
Were through the looking glass
Here white is black and black is
white

BILL
What do you think Lou

LOU
Im just an investigator Bill I
leave the theories to you lawyers

BILL
You Numa

NUMA
A week ago I wouldve said this is
nuts but now
(shakes his head)
Theres a lot of smoke there but
theres some fire

BILL
Now you guys come on Youre talking
about the United States Government
here

JIM
Were talking about a crime Bill
No one is above the law Reduce it
A crime was committed Lets get to
work

MEDICAL UNIT - JAIL - DAY Jack Ruby thick fudge of an angry face flu-ridden confronts
a doctor and two guards in his cell

RUBY
Christ what the hell kinda needle
is that I just got a cold for
Chrissake I dont want any shot

DOCTOR
Please relax Mr Ruby Thisll
calm you down and clear this up

RUBY
Doc Im telling you I dont need
any shots
DOCTOR
Mr Ruby I dont want to involve
the guards Itll just take a few
seconds

Ruby looks over at the two guards who eye him The Doctor
gives him the injection

FLASHBACK TO Rubys jail cell in 1964 Ruby talks to men
with their backs to us Lawyers and police clutter the cell
making Ruby hyper-nervous The chief officials white hair
and avuncular voice are all we see and hear of him his back
is to us

RUBY
Then do you understand that I cannot
tell the truth here In Dallas
That there are people here who do
not want me to tell the truth
who do not want me to have a retrial

OFFICIAL
Mr Ruby I really cant see why you
cant tell us now

Ruby catches the stern face of Sheriff Bill Decker from the
corner of his eye the Assistant DA next to him

RUBY
When are you going back to Washington
sir

OFFICIAL

(looks at watch)
I am going back very shortly after
we finish this hearing - I am going
to have some lunch

RUBY
Can I make a statement If you
request me to go back to Washington
with you right now that is if you
want to hear further testimony from
me can you do that Can you take
me with you

OFFICIAL
No that could not be done Mr Ruby
There are a good many things involved
in that

RUBY
What are they

OFFICIAL
Well the public attention it would
attract And we have no place for

you there to be safe were not law
enforcement officials and many things
are at stake in this affair Mr

Ruby

RUBY
But if I am eliminated there wont
be any way of knowing Consequently
a whole new form of government is
going to take over this country and
I know I wont live to see you another
time My life is in danger here
Do I sound screwy

OFFICIAL
Well I dont know what can be done
Mr Ruby because I dont know what
you anticipate we will encounter

RUBY
Then you dont stand a chance Mr
Chief Justice you have a lost cause
All I want is a lie detector test
and you refuse to give it to me
Because as it stands now - and the
truth serum - how do you pronounce
it - Pentothal - whatever it is
They will not give it to me because
I want to tell the truth And then
I want to leave this world

The camera pauses on Rubys face The men rise and leave in
the shadows

PARKLAND MEMORIAL HOSPITAL - Jack Ruby is escorted out of the infirmary dead of cancer
BROUSSARDS RESTAURANT - NEW ORLEANS - The puffy smiling face of Dean Andrews framed by huge black
glasses talks in a Louisiana hippie argot of the 50s The

restaurant has a fancy French decor mirrored walls marble -
it serves the cream of Louisiana society

ANDREWS
Why you keep dancing on my head for
my man We been thickern molasses
pie since law school

JIM
Because you keep conning me Dean
I read your testimony to the Warren
Commission and
ANDREWS
There you go Grain of salt Two
sides to every coin

JIM
You tell them the day after the
assassination you were called on the
phone by this Clay Bertrand and
asked to fly to Dallas and be Lee
Oswalds layer

ANDREWS
Right

JIM
Now thats pretty important Dean
You also told the FBI when you met

tell the Commission he was five foot
eight How the hell did the man
shrink like that Dean

ANDREWS
They put the heat on my man just
like youre doing I gaveem anything
that popped into my cabeza Truth
is I never met the dude

Sudden FLASHBACK to Andrews office on a day in 1963 Clay
Bertrand sits back to us talking to Andrews He has close-
cropped white hair He is the same patrician man weve seen
earlier with Oswald on Canal Street and in Banisters office
Andrews is evidently lying

ANDREWS

I dont know what the cat looks like
and furthermore I dont know where
hes at All I know is sometimes he
sends me cases So one day hes on
the phone talkin to me about going
to Dallas and repping Oswald

(notices a woman in

present)

Opelousas yknow elevator didnt

JIM
(remembering)
Yeah she was pretty all right but
not half as cute as you Deano You

business

ANDREWS
(chuckles)
You cant ever say crime dont pay
in Louisiana Jim - only not as good
as it used to Good chowder aint

JIM

this Bertrand

ANDREWS
(bored)

JIM

bureau needing help no bread and
Id say hey man I aint Rockefeller

cornmuffins go to the phone and

FLASHBACK TO Andrews office on another day in 1963 We
catch a glimpse of a young swish sitting in Andrews office
talking on the phone Andrews is also on the phone to
Bertrand unseen on the other end

ANDREWS
The dude on the other end says

CLAY BERTRAND

ANDREWS

ANDREWS

command of the kings English

JIM
Did he pay

ANDREWS
Always - like tits on a pig I wish
I had a million of those bimbettes

JIM
And Oswald

ANDREWS
(just a slight
hesitation)
Like I told to the Washington boys
Bertrand called that summer and asked
me to help the kid upgrade his Marine
discharge

JIM
So you saw Oswald how many times

ANDREWS
Three four He came in with a few
Cubano swishes one time I remember

TO a third day at Andrews office in 1963

office with two young boys

JIM (VO)
Recall any names

ANDREWS
(in present)
Mario Jose - they wear names like
you and I wear clothes Today the
name is Candy tomorrow its Butsie
I wish I could help you Jim

JIM
Did you speak to Oswald in Dallas

ANDREWS
(knee-jerk reaction)
Hell no I told this Bertrand cat

I deal with muni court Im a hack
in nigger town that kid needs a hot
dog

Oswald
JIM
Then how the hell did you get in the
Warren Commission Dean Except
through the phone records in the
Dallas jail

ANDREWS
(nervous moment)
There were no phone records

JIM
Of course there werent Cause they
disappeared And yet the Commission
found you Dean

ANDREWS

I dont know how they got to me
Maybe cause I repped him here The
Feebees run background checks On
my mamas breasts man thats all I
got

(pauses adjusts)
There wasnt no conspiracy Jim If
there were why the hell didnt Bobby
Kennedy prosecute it as Attorney
General he was his brother for
Chrissake How the fuck three people
could keep a secret like that I
dont know It was Oswald He was
a nut job Faggot yknow hated
this country

As Andrews resumes eating his crabmeat Louie with gusto Jim
reaches over and grabs the fork in mid-air

JIM
Dean I think were having a
communication problem I know you

know who Clay Bertrand is Now stop
eating that damn crabmeat for a minute
and listen

(gets Deans attention)
Im aware of our long friendship
but I want you to know Im going to
call you in front of a grand jury
I took nine judges on Deano right
here in New Orleans and I beat em
all If you lie to the grand jury
as youve been lying to me Im going
to charge you with perjury Now am
I communicating with you

Andrews puts down the fork shaken silent for a moment

ANDREWS
Is this off the record Daddy-o
(Jim nods)
In that case let me sum it up for
you real quick If I answer that
question you keep asking me if I
give you the name of the Big
Enchilada yknow then its bon
voyage Deano - I mean like permanent
I mean like a bullet in my head
You dig Does that help you see my
problem a little better Youre a
mouse fighting a gorilla Kennedys
dead as that crab meat The
governments still breathing You
want to line up with a dead man

At a nearby table a waiter has just poured brandy on Crepe
Suzettes A blue flame hovers in the air as Jim leans forward
across the table speaking deliberately

JIM
Read my lips Deano Either you
dance into the Grand Jury with the
real identity of Clay Bertrand or
your fat behind is going to the
slammer Do you dig me

Andrews stands suddenly

ANDREWS
Youre just as crazy aS your mama
Goes to show its in the genes Do
you have any idea what youre getting
into my man You think Jack Ruby
just up and died of cancer in four
weeks after he gets a retrial Thats
some kinda new cancer - Id say thats
a going out of business cancer
You got the right ta-ta but the
wrong ho-ho The governments gonna
jump all over your head Jimbo and
go cock-a-doodledoo

Andrews drops his pink napkin in the crabmeat and waddles
out Jim now feels closer to the truth than ever

ANGOLA PRISON - LOUISIANA COUNTRYSIDE - From the point of view of an approaching car the prison
looms over the swamp dogs patrolling the wire

VOICE (VO)
District Attorney Garrison to see
Prisoner 5388 Ward Block 237B

GUARDS VOICE (V0O)

PRISON DORMITORY - A chief guard walks Jim and Bill into a circus-like
atmosphere In Louisiana the prisoners can wear any outfit

There are many transvestites

GUARD

express reason to meet him

JIM
For sexual purposes

OKEEFE
Well yeah
FLASHBACK TO the Masquerade Bar in the French Quarter Its
nighttime and Ferrie Bertrand and OKeefe sit at a back
booth Bertrand as seen earlier is an imposing white-
haired patrician man over six feet tall heavily defined
bones and eyelids in his late 40s or early 50s

BILL (V0O)
Did he pay you for this

OKEEFE (V0)
Twenty dollars each time Hell
its no secret Thats what Im
here for

They rise to leave Bertrand with a slight limp

JIM (VO)
Anything else unusual about him youd
be able to describe in a court of
law Willie

OKEEFE (V0)

I remember he had some kinda thing
wrong with his left leg He limped
Dont get me wrong hes not one of
those you know limp wrists Hes
a butch John Youd meet him on the
street youd never snap You could
go fishing with him play poker with
him youd never snap in a million
years So one night we were over at
Ferries place Having a party
Sometime in the late summer of 63

FLASHBACK TO Dave Ferries apartment on a night in 1963

The place is filled messy bricabrac including two dozen

mouse cages for Ferries cancer experiments Ferrie
Bertrand OKeefe and four Cubans in battle fatigues are
laughing and fooling around Oswald is in a corner cleaning

a 22 rifle with a scope on it He looks different unkempt
unshaven A record player grinds out a speech in Spanish by
Castro Some other people are there as well - its a beatnik
scene sandals hanging out only one woman Ferrie is taking
pictures throughout of the group horsing around photographing
Oswald

OKEEFE

there were about nine or ten
people Cubans friends of Dave doing
some stuff in the bush with him
Place was a mess Daves mind was a
mess

(laughs)

Yknow he had all those mice cages
around cause hes working on this
cure for cancer Daves smart -
real smart - speaks five languages
knows philosophy medicine military
history politics He wanted to be

a priest but they defrocked him cause
he was queer

BILL (V0O)
And thats where you met Oswald for
the first time

OKEEFE (VO)
Yeah strange guy Dave introduced
him as

FERRIE
Willie say hello to Leon Oswald

OKEEFE
(over the racket)
How ya doing

OSWALD
(sullen to Ferrie)
What the fucks he doing here

OKEEFE
Fuck you man

Ferrie separates them Oswald seems to resent an outsider
being there

FERRIE
(to OKeefe)
Leons in a bad mood dont get
excited hes all right

JIM (VO)
Would you say this Leon was actually
Lee Harvey Oswald

OKEEFE
(in present)
Fuck yes Hell Im already in
jail I got no reason to lie to
you I aint no nigger

BILL
Go on Willie

OKEEFE
(present merging to
past)
well the party got crazier and
crazier one of those yknow
beatnik type things
FERRIE

(to OKeefe)
Were having a little meeting here

(indicates the second

player)
Thats Castro Sounds like Hitler
doesnt he Sonofabitch is going to
go Real soon

CUBANS
Muerte a Fidel Muerte

BERTRAND
(irritated at the
noise)
Oh stop it already What are all
these people doing here anyway I
cant bear all this infernal noise

FERRIE
Clara dont be so sensitive

BERTRAND
I didnt come here for a pep rally
Get all this riffraff out of here

FERRIE
Okay okay

TIMECUT TO later that night when only OKeefe Ferrie
Bertrand Oswald and three Cubans are left

OKEEFE (VO)
finally they got out of there and
I found myself alone with Dave and
this Leon two of the Cubans and
this guy Bertrand Dave pulled out
his clippings which he was always
carrying around Hed been obsessed
with Castro and Kennedy for months
and he started in again

FERRIE

(waving a clipping

drunk)
Kennedy fucked us in 61 62 and
hes fuckin us now And that fuckin
zealot Bobby Kennedy is the fuckee
The nerve of that little asswipe
closing the camps Took all our C-
4 Took ten thousand rounds 3000
pounds of gunpowder all our weapons
Next well be living in a world where
only the cocksucking Reds will have
all the weapons and well be
surrounded If we want a free Cuba

we gotta whack out the fucking beard

CUBAN
That faggot Kennedy wont let us
Our hands are empty - how can we
kill him

BERTRAND
(moving with a drink
walks with a slight
limp)
Its a real problem getting at him
Castros got informers on every block

FERRIE

(pointing to a map of

Cuba on the wall)
Bullshit Theres all kinds of new
stuff I heard about rockets in an
umbrella - theyre tested at Fort
Detrick I can show you a dozen
poisons Stick it in his food hell
die in three days no trace We can
put something in his beard make it
fall out hell look fuckin
ridiculous without his beard

CUBAN
(drunk)

Why dont we just take care of the
main problem Which is that piece
of shit Kennedy Hes doing all
kinds of deals Kissing Khrushchevs
ass I wouldnt even call him
President Kennedy

OKEEFE (VO)

then the Cubans left and the
bullshitting was going on Dave was
drunk really drunk and he starts in
with Kennedy again

FERRIE
See what Kennedy done with him you
should take a knife and stab and
kill the fucker where he is now I
mean it This is true But I tell
you something I hope I get a weeks
notice Ill kill Right in the
fuckin White House Somebodys got
to get rid of this fucker

Oswald looks up listens quietly

OKEEFE
Oh cmon Dave youre never gonna
get that sonofabitch

FERRIE
No It wont be long mark my words
That fuckerll get whats coming to
him And it can be blamed on Castro
Then the whole countryll want to
invade Cuba All we got to do is
get Kennedy in the open

Bertrand with his arms around OKeefe laughs tries to change
the subject

BERTRAND
David David always some harebrained
scheme or another Oh What do I

see here Oooooh lets have some
more champagne shall we

OKEEFE
(interested in Ferries
proposal)
What about the Secret Service the
cops

FERRIE

(pacing hyper)
No problem if its planned right
Look how close they got with de
Gaulle Eisenhower was always riding
around in an open top I know
somebody who actually went up and
touched Eisenhower once We need to
have three mechanics at three
different locations An office
building with a high-powered rifle
Triangulation of crossfire is the
key You get the diversionary shot
gets the Secret Service looking one
way - Boom You get the kill shot
The crucial thing is one man has to
be sacrificed then in the commotion
of the crowd the job gets done and
the others fly out of the country to
someplace with no extradition I
could do that myself I could fly
to Mexico and then Brazil

Oswald listens playing with his rifle Bertrand suddenly
turns cold flashing a look at Ferrie

BERTRAND
Why dont we drop this subject
its one thing to engage in badinage
with these youngsters but this sort
of thing could be so easily
misunderstood
(he squeezes Ferrie)

FERRIE
Ouch

OKEEFE (VO)

I didnt think much about it at the
time Just bullshit yknow
everybody likes to make themselves
out to be something more than they
are Specially in the homosexual
underworld But then when they got
him

(merging to the present)
I got real scared yknow Real
scared And thats when I got popped

BACK TO the prison work area Jim and OKeefe continue
talking

JIM
Willie are you willing to repeat
your statements under sodium
pentothal Under the supervision of
a doctor

OKEEFE
Fuck yeah I told you so And you
can tellem all I told you so

JIM
You realize the things youre saying
Willie are going to be attacked by
a lot of different people

OKEEFE
Bring on all the motherfuckers
Bring their college degrees in here
I got nuthin to hide They cant
buy me You cant buy me I dont
even need the parole This is about
the truth coming out Youre a
goddamn liberal Mr Garrison you
dont know shit cause you never

JIM
No ones trying to buy you Willie
Its important to know why youre
telling us this

OKEEFE
(pauses)
You wanna know why Cause that
mother fucker Kennedy stole that
fuckin election thats why Nixon
was gonna be one of the great
Presidents til Kennedy wrecked this
fuckin country Got niggers all
over the fuckin place asking for
their rights where do you think we
got all this fuckin crime now cause
Kennedy promised em too damned much
Revolution comin Fascisms coming

Communist sumbitch died was a great
day for this country I jes hate

silly fuckin Oswald who didnt know
shit anyway People should know why
that sumbitch was killed Cause he
was a Communist Put me on the stand
go ahead Ill tell the same goddamn
story Im proud of it dont matter
fuck all to me things dont change

As he talks Jim shares a sickened look with Bill Whatever
truth he may be telling is necessarily compromised by an
attitude that could be destroyed in court

GARRISON HOME - NIGHT Jim Lou Al Susie and Numa sit around the table having an
after hours conference The kids run in and out of the room
playing Susie is doing the talking showing new paperwork
and photos

SUSIE
Your hunch was right boss but its
even spookier than we thought
Starting in September 63 on two
months before the assassination
there are sightings of Oswald all
over Dallas buying ammunition
getting a telescopic sight fixed
going to rifle ranges Early
November a Dallas downtown Lincoln-
Mercury dealership where he tells
the salesman Albert Bogard

FLASHBACK TO the Lincoln-Mercury dealership Oswald is
deliberately kept in half or three quarter shots - a mystery
figure He kicks the tires on a used red Mercury Comet
cocky

OSWALD

Lets take it out for a test drive

The salesman Bogard is hesitant Oswald doesnt look
like hes got a dime to his name

OSWALD

(SENSING BOGARDS HESITANCY)
Hey I got a lotta money coming in
the next two weeks

In the next scene we see the car driven by Oswald zooming
up the ramp and disappearing onto the freeway

SUSIE (VO)
despite the fact he has no license
and from what marina says does not
know how to drive he hits the curves
like Mario Andretti at the Indy 500
Bogard later told his boss he drove
like a madman

Resume the scene at the dealership

Oswald

FLASHBACK

BOGARD
Three hundred bucks down Mr Oswald
you can drive outta here with it

unhappy starts to leave

OSWALD
Who you kidding For this heap
Forget it No honest working man

can afford a car anymore in the
goddamn country Maybe Ill have to
go back to Russia to buy a car

SUSIE (V0O)

really dumb dialogue like hes
trying to draw attention to himself
A real moron He walks out The
salesman remembers him as about 57
but we know from his draft card he
was about 511

LOU
several witnesses see him on
several separate days at different
firing ranges

TO a Dallas firing range in 1963

LOU
one time November 9 he decides
he needs to practice on the target
of the guy next to him Says
something really dumb to the guy
who says Oswald was a great shot
MAN

Hey watcha doing boy
target

OSWALD
Hey sorry buddy I just

it was that sonofabitch Ke
yknow I couldnt help m
(laughs)

JIM
(in present)
about as subtle as a co
crawling across a white ru

SUSIE
Ill go you one better Lo
shows up at Silvia Odios
lady in Dallas working in
Castro underground - remem
name a solid witness Th
introduce him as Leon Osw

FLASHBACK TO the corridor of Silvia
on a night in 1963 Oswald drags be
the Bull heavyset with a scar ove
saw at the Canal Street incident an
is quiet and cold The men ring the
concerned Silvia as Oswald hangs bac
shadows The men give her intimate
father who is imprisoned in Cuba
in Spanish

SUSIE

the Cubans want Silvia
parents are political pris
Cuba to help them raise m
assassinate Castro
the men bothers her She
she doesnt want anything
violence about 48 hours
of the Cubans calls her ba

We see a shot of Silvia on the phone
with a shot of the Bull in a gas s
night in 1963

THE BULL
(on the phone
Spanish)
This guy Leon Oswalds gre
kinda nut he told us w
any guts us Cubans cause
shouldve been whacked aft
of Pigs
done that

in

its easy to do

thats my

he says -

you know hes a Marine an expert
shooter

Silvia Odio is surprised to hear this information volunteered
The Bulls eyes are on Oswaldo outside the booth with
the Indian Theyre hanging out talking to a mystery

man an Anglo

SUSIE

Its like hes giving her information
she doesnt even ask for Shes
scared doesnt see them again till
she sees Oswalds picture in the
paper But the Warren Commission
says she has bad eyesight because
they have Oswald in Mexico at this
time trying to get back into Cuba
The Cubans think hes a double agent
so they wont take him The CIA has
a camera outside the Cuban Embassy
and says this is Oswald in Mexico

(hands over a picture)
You figure it

Jim looks at the famous photo the camera closes in on a
heavyset man who looks nothing like Oswald Liz has come
back in and overhears

AL
If this is Oswald it must be our
third Oswald

JIM

The interesting thing is the extent
to which the Warren Commission went
to make him a Communist They got
almost 150 pages and 130 exhibits of
the report on this Mexico trip and
the picture doesnt even match Im
beginning to think the point of the
Mexican episode was to lay the blame
at Castros door If Oswald or
someone purporting to be Oswald had
gotten into Cuba come back then
killed the President the American
public once again wouldve screamed
for a Cuban invasion

Susie picks up the famous Life magazine cover shot of Oswald
holding a rifle in his backyard

SUSIE
I even have doubts about this photo
boss It pretty much convicted Oswald
in the public mind Well according
to Captain Fritz Oswald told him
during his interrogation the photo
was fake

FLASHBACK TO the Dallas Homicide Office in 1963 Oswald is
being interrogated by Will Fritz Dallas Homicide Chief who
shows him the original of the photo from the Williams garage

OSWALD
Thats not me

FRITZ
It came from Janet Williams garage

OSWALD
Well I never saw that picture It
is my face but my face has been
super-imposed - the rest of the
picture is not me at all Ive done
a lot of photographic work and that
picture was made by someone else

FRITZ
So who the hell are you Alex Hidell
or Oswald

OSWALD
Well youre the policeman you work
it out

SUSIE

(in the present)
Oswald who worked for Jaggars-Chiles-—
Stovall did know spy photography
pretty well I took this picture to
two experts Look at the way the
shadows on the nose fall in a straight
line like its high noon But the
shadow here on the ground reads like
late afternoon or early morning
Its not the same time Also look
at the crop marks across the chin
It seems like his head is pasted on
somebody elses body implicating him
with this rifle and gun

We see a blowup of the photo - the shadows the crop mark

SUSIE
And of the two newspapers in his
hands one is Leninist the other
Trotskyite Any genuine Socialist
would know they hate each others
politics

FRENCH QUARTER - SAME NIGHT Broussard walks past a jazz wake leaving the cemetery - black
flambeurs carry torches people sing When the Saints Go
Marching in Bill is with a local gambler type

MOBSTER
Clay Bertrand Sure I know him He
comes around the Quarter

BILL
Who is he Joe Ive been to every
bar no one wants to talk

MOBSTER
I told your uncle I never met a lawman
who wasnt a punk You too Bill
even if youre family Hes a big
shot businessman I seen him on the
TV news a lot with all the other big
shots A fag you know Goes by
another name down here

BILL
(excited)
Whats the other name

MOBSTER
Shaw Clay Shaw

BILL
(stunned)
Clay Bertrand is Clay Shaw The guy
who used to run the International
Trade Mart

MOBSTER
Yeah whats the big mystery
Everybody down here knows the guy

BILL
So why does he call himself Bertrand

MOBSTER
Who gives a shit what he calls
himself

BACK AT GARRISONS HOME - SUSIE

-now it gets positively spooky
In January 1961 - in New Orleans
at the Bolton Ford Dealership - when
the Oswald we know is in Russia -
there is a man using the name Oswald
to buy trucks for the Friends of
Democratic Cuba The salesman never
saw him again but guess whos on
The staff
now sigh

the articles of incorporation of the
Friends of Democratic Cuba Guy
Banister

(reactions from the

others)
Banister has someone using the name
Oswald to buy the trucks Hoover
at the FBI writes a memo dated June
1960 that there could be someone
using Oswalds passport and identity

JIM
Goddamn They put Oswald together
from Day One Like some dummy
corporation in the Bahamas - you
just move him around a board Sent
him to Russia in and out no passport
problems You got the word
microdots in his notebook you got
the Minox camera and the electronic
devices they find in his possessions
the sealed DIZ201 personnel file
For all we know there could be a
dozen Oswalds in different cities
countries - all of them leaving a
trail of incriminating evidence that
could easily be traced to a scapegoat
after the assassination Does the
real Oswald know hes been put
together Who knows It doesnt
matter does it Hes a low level
spy he doesnt know who he really
works for

(PAUSE)
Lets call it a night
(to Lou)
Anything new on Ruby

members anxious to go home have all risen

LOU
Mobbed up all the way Tight with
the Dallas cops Im digging chief

As he leaves the camera holds on Liz

GARRISON OFFICE - Clay Shaw (Bertrand) in an elegant white summer suit is
shown in Indeed there is a slight limp to his gait which

Jim notices right away

He shares a look with Bill Susie is also in the room
Shaws rich bassoon voice drips with dialect Imperiously
smoking a Gaulois Shaw has about him an air of authority

CLAY SHAW
Mr Garrison - what can I do for you
on Easter Sunday

JIM
Im sorry Mr Shaw to interrupt
this holiday but I feel this is a
conversation we might better have
out of the everyday bustle in this
office

SHAW
(sitting)
Im not sure I understand

JIM
(bringing some papers
forward)
Well in an investigation were
conducting your name has come up a
number of times

SHAW
I wouldnt imagine where

JIM
We recently talked to a number of
men who claim to know you Are you
acquainted with a David Logan

SHAW
No Never heard of him

JIM
A Perry Russo

SHAW
No

JIM
A Willie OKeefe

SHAW
No I dont believe I know anyone by
that name

JIM
Mr OKeefe told us he met you at
the Masquerade Bar down in the Quarter
and several evenings later you had
him over for dinner at your apartment
on Dauphine Street Do you recall
that
FLASHBACK TO Clays Dauphine Street residence in the Quarter
at night in 1962 The butler opens the door and OKeefe is
admitted to the townhouse Shaw appears behind the butler

SHAW (VO)

(in present)
Of course not I dont know this
man Obviously then I wouldnt
have him to dinner Incidentally I
do not live in an apartment Its
an 1860s house built by Gallier
Ive restored it faithfully You
know I am quite an advocate of
restoration

At Shaws house dinner is served at a long table by the
black butler The table is decorated by a sumptuous setting
of silver and candelabra

Shaw uses a bell to summon the butler

JIM (VO)
Perhaps a few more details about the
evening will refresh your memory
Mr OKeefe told us dinner was served
by a uniformed waiter - a colored
man He particularly remembers that
you sat at one end and he at the
other - which he found rather unusual
because the table was so long Does
that bring back memories of Willie
OKeefe

SHAW

(in present)
Not at all But on the other hand
I do have a lovely Chippendale dining
table and I often have a friend over
sitting at one end while I sit at
the other That is precisely the
point of a long dining table The
splendor of the meal adds to the
enjoyment of it

JIM
I would imagine a uniformed waiter
helps

SHAW

It adds a taste of elegance for which
I must confess a weakness for now

and then I call him Smedley His
real name is Frankie Jenkins - but I
could hardly imagine anything more
uncouth during dinner than my turning
toward the kitchen and hollering
Frankie Where is this leading
to Mr Garrison

Willie OKeefe and Clay Shaw leave the dining table

JIM (VO)
After dinner you paid him to have
sex with you

SHAW (VO)
(laughing)
Pffft Absolute nonsense The
Quarter is filled with vivid
imaginations my dear Mr Garrison -
grimy young hoodlums wholl say and
do anything As you well know

JIM (VO)
in the course of that night Mr
OKeefe said a man named David Ferrie
stopped by the house along with
another young man

At Shaws townhouse we see Ferrie coming in with another
young chicken

SHAW (VO)
Who

JIM (VO)
David Ferrie

SHAW (V0O)
No I have never known anyone by
that name Of course never having
met Mr OKeefe I could hardly have
met Mr Ferrie

JIM (VO)
and that the four of you partied
early into the morning hours

We see the four men in drag smiling for the flash camera
champagne bottles in hand Ferrie sniffs some poppers then
shoves a popper in Shaws face

FERRIE
(to Shaw)
Youre mine Mary Go get the fucking
tools out bitch Now I want some
ass

Ferrie forces more poppers on Shaw The camera movies to
Shaws bedroom where Ferrie scatters a drawer full of leather
tools
FERRIE

(to Shaw)
Come here bitch

(Ferrie grabs Shaw by

the hair)
You want this The only way you get
this is do what I say

(Ferrie whacks Shaw)
Im the man Dont ever forget it

(Shaw begs and whines)
You want it You want it

(Ferrie spits on Shaw)
Fuck you and your rich friends
Youre nothing but a rich whore
Youre my woman Get the cat

(to young man)
Strip Now woman I want to see
skin

BACK TO Garrisons office

JIM
(in present)

Let me show you his picture
(he hands Shaw a
general photo of
Ferrie)

SHAW
(in present)
No Im sure Ive never met anyone
of such a bizarre appearance

JIM
Does the name Clay Bertrand mean
anything to you

SHAW
Clay Bertrand Clay Bertrand I
believe there was a man with a name
similar to that who worked at the
Chamber of Commerce Is that the
man you had in mind

JIM
No it was not Do you know an
attorney by the name of Dean Andrews

SHAW
One meets so many attorneys in my
business No I dont believe I
know Dean Andrews

Jim is getting incredibly irritated He feels Shaw is lying
CUT TO Antoines Restaurant where Liz and all five
look at menus

SNAPPER
Im hungry Whenre we gonna eat

LIZ
Were going to start without him and
hell be here for dessert Snapper

VIRGINIA

SNAPPER

JASPER
(disappointed)

Whens Daddy coming Mama

LIZ
Soon Hes real sorry he cant start
with us but hes promised to be here

BACK TO Garrisons office later that day Everyone

tired as the questioning goes on

Gauloises

JIM
(handing a photo to
Shaw)
Mr Shaw can you identify this man

SHAW

Naturally

(he looks up)

Are you claiming Mr Garrison that
Mr Oswald also had dinner with me

JIM

(humorless)

Mr Shaw did you ever meet Lee Harvey
Oswald

SHAW
You really have me consorting with a
cast of sordid characters dont
you Mr Garrison

JIM
Please answer the question

SHAW
Of course not Such a pity that
assassination In fact I admired

kids

looks

Shaw sucks on endless
Jim shows

President Kennedy A man with true
panache and a wife with impeccable
taste

Shaw a newspaper clipping

JIM
Mr Shaw this is an Italian newspaper
article saying you were a member of
the Board of Centro Mondo Commerciale
in Italy that this company was a
creature of the CIA for the transfer
of funds in Italy for illegal
political-espionage activities It
says that this company was expelled
from Italy for those activities

SHAW
Im well aware of this asinine
article And I am thinking very
seriously of suing this rag of a
newspaper

JIM
It says that this company has heavily
Fascist ties to the French secret
army organization that tried to
assassinate de Gaulle in 1960

SHAW
Nonsense What next

JIM
and that this company is linked
to the Schlumber tool company here
in Houma Louisiana - which is where
their arms may have come from to
David Ferrie and his Cubans

SHAW
Mr Garrison youre reaching I am
an international businessman The

Trade Mart which I founded is
Americas commercial pipeline to
Latin America I trade everywhere

I am accused as are all businessmen
of all things I somehow go about

my business make money help society
the best I can and try to promote
free trade in this world

JIM
Mr Shaw have you ever been a
contract agent with the Central
Intelligence Agency
Shaw glares at him Silence

SHAW
(with powerful contempt)
And if I was Mr Garrison do you
think I would be here today talking

to somebody like you

JIM
No people like you dont have to I
guess - people like you walk between
the raindrops

SHAW
(rising)
May I go Regardless of what you
may think of me Mr Garrison I am
a patriot first and foremost

JIM
Ive spent half my life in the United
States military serving and defending
this great country Mr Shaw and
youre the first person I ever met
who considered it an act of patriotism
to kill his own president

SHAW
Now just a minute sir Youre way
out of line

Susie and Bill quiet Jim down

BILL

Come on chief

(as he shows Shaw to

the door)
Im sorry Mr Shaw its getting
late Thats all the questions we
have Thank you for your honesty
and for coming in today

SHAW
I enjoyed meeting with you gentlemen
and you Miss Cox It was most
pleasant I wish to extend to each
of you - and to each of your families -
my best wishes for a happy Easter

JIM

country where justice wont be an
arcane vanished idea they read about
in history books like the dinosaurs
or the lost continent of Atlantis

LIZ

replace a father and a husband on
Easter Day

JIM
(angry turns away)
Its going to get worse honey

GARRISONS OFFICE HALLWAY - MORNING Jim is coming down the corridor with Broussard is confronted
by some 20 local journalists and TV crew members We hear a
hubbub of fierce questioning - ad libs but Jim puzzled
brushes by seeking refuge in his office Lou Al Numa and
Susie are all waiting for him The regular staff - some 30
people - are looking wondering Lou presents him with the
front page of the New Orleans States-Item

LOU

picture of him is on the front page He puts down the paper
reaching for a long gold pen that is part of the desk set

JIM
They hunted down the news its their
business Getting angry doesnt

flack together

They look at each other

JIM

bachelor apartment A fan is blowing

NEWSMAN 11

(editorial)
Mr Garrisons own silence on the
subject has raised some interesting
questions With taxpayer money has
he uncovered some valuable new
evidence or is he merely saving the
information which will gain for him
exposure on a national level Mr

explanation

Are we famous or what

Bill has come in during this

JIM

Notorious is more like it Jim
Garrison is right There has been a
conspiracy in New Orleans - but its
a plot of Garrisons own making
and this - one of the DAs
investigators offered an unwilling
witness 3000 if only he would fill
in the facts of the alleged meeting
to plot the death of the President
How can they write that Where did

Numa pulls a dollar bill from the envelope

NUMA
Thats what its about boss For
every lousy article in the press
theres a hundred of these

Jim is moved Bill is not

BILL

Thats fine Numa but what about

all the people who arent writing
letters Theyre sitting home reading
all these lies I just heard NBC
crews in town to do a White Paper -
not on the Kennedy killing but on

us One of their top guys Harry
Stoner is talking to everybody he

can find about you boss

JIM
Oh Jesus Stoner Why doesnt he
call me

NUMA

(to Bill)

What do you want to do Bill - fold
up and close the store You sound

BILL

Look this is bigger than all of us
We cant try a case in this
atmosphere

Sharon has come in during this signalling to Jim

SHARON
Mr Millers been waiting

JIM
(remembering)
Oh Send him in
(to Numa)
Denver oilman wants to support the
investigation

(specifically to Bill)
Bill I know what youre thinking
but sometimes when it makes no sense
thats exactly when you just gotta
stick to it head down

Sharon shows in Mr Miller the Denver oilman Hes a self-
assured impressive man in his 50s with a western accent
cowboy boots and hat and a well-cut gabardine suit

JIM
Welcome Mr Miller Jim Garrison
Would you care for some coffee

MILLER
Yes thank you Mr Garrison Your
coffees almost Turkish down here
but I could get used to it

Numa leaves Bill indicates hed like to sit in Jim nods
okay Miller pays no attention to Bill

MILLER
Im glad you could find time to see
me I flew down from Denver this

morning on my private jet

JIM
Yes your letter indicated you were
in he oil business up there

MILLER
Ive done quite well in Denver Mr
Garrison but I have to admire someone
like you - and I have the means to
back up what I say

JIM
We can use all the support we can
get I think these might interest
you

Jim has gathered together a group of photos of the shooting
Sharon bringing the coffee

JIM
Theyve been enlarged and show a lot
of detail

MILLER

Splendid love to see them

He glances at the photo but continues on across the room
looking at the pictures on the walls

MILLER
Where were you Europe Pacific

JIM
Germany

MILLER
You were lucky I spent three years
in the Pacific
(he looks out the
blinds at Tulane
Avenue)
Ive never seen an avenue with such
a profusion of bail-bonding companies
Why is that

JIM

(nettled by Millers

moving around)
I imagine because this is the Criminal
District Court Building

(showing a photo)
This is an enlargement of a potential
shooter standing behind the picket
fence We

We see a blurry blowup of something behind the picket fence
Miller takes the photo glances at it and sits down

MILLER
I know about that shot A terrible
tragedy
(Puts the photo back
on the desk)
How much do you have for carrying on
your investigation

JIM
If you must know virtually nothing

MILLER
How many men are working with you on
this

JIM

Less than you would guess Most
days two to three assistant DAs
A handful of police investigators

MILLER
Thats all youve had all this time

JIM
Thats it

Jim expectant of some help A pause Then

MILLER
I admire you Mr Garrison How did
you manage to make your way into Guy
Banisters operation

The clock is ticking Jim shares a look with Bill The
cards are on the table
JIM
That was never in he newspapers Mr
Miller

Miller smiles stands paces the room He continues to ignore
Bill completely

MILLER

Im going to be very frank with you
Youve done a great job an astounding
job considering the limited resources
available to you But the best you
can ever hope for is to stir upa
lot of confusion Youre not going
to do this country any good and
youre not going to do yourself any
good

(he sits back down

and looks directly

at Jim)
You dont belong here On this Mickey
Mouse street with that cheap strip
of bail bond shops

JIM
The job manages to keep me pretty
busy

MILLER

Nonsense You should be in a job
where you can make decisions that
have impact affect the world Here
youre trying to climb up the steep
side of Mount Everest

He leans forward across Jims desk tapping his manicured
index finger on the desk Clearly visible to Jim and to us
(in a close-up) is Millers Annapolis ring tapping

MILLER

I propose you accept an appointment
to the bench in Federal District
Court and move into a job worthy of
your talent

(he leans back and

pauses)
Do you have any idea do you have
any conception of how easily such an
appointment can be arranged

JIM
And what would I have to do

MILLER
Stop your investigation it was a
magnificent effort but its over and
done with The press is already on
your behind and thats only the
beginning my boy only the beginning

JIM
How long do you think it would take
me to be appointed

Jims eyes go to Bill He could be wrong but its almost
as if Bill were going along with the idea now

MILLER
(smiling thinking
Jim is hooked)
Well ordinarily these things take a
long time But in your case with
your record it can be expedited -
easily I guarantee it

Jim leans back puts his feet up on the corner of the desk
waving them like fans Bill waits

JIM

Who are you Mr Miller

(no answer - just the

sound of the overhead

fan)
You see that helmet over there

(the Nazi helmet with

a bullet hole on his

desk)
I picked that up at the Dachau
concentration camp when we liberated
it in 1945 It was the most
horrifying sight Ive ever seen Mr
Miller Pyramids of decaying
stinking bones and skin one on top
of the other I dont enjoy looking
at that swastika every day Mr
Miller but I keep it there to remind
me of what can happen when a country
turns from free democratic principles
to Fascism when a few madmen turn
human beings into digits and millions
sit in silence and do nothing about
it

Miller waits Bill waits Jim comes forward with his reply

JIM
Mr Miller you and I have met under
a great misunderstanding I havent
the remotest interest in becoming a
Federal Judge And nothing is going
to keep me from going ahead with my
investigation of John Kennedys
murder

Millers entire demeanor tightens into a corkscrew of anger
and danger

JIM
Bill Mr Miller and I have finished
our conversation Would you show
him out

Bill has a strange reaction - a sudden exhalation of breath
as if an entire house of cards were collapsing He rises
but Miller goes first leaving silently Once hes gone
Bill turns wearily to Jim

JIM
Those bastards Thats proof enough
right there of what were up against
The whole goddamn Federal Government

Bill

BILL
Well they offered you the carrot
and you turned it down you know

whats coming next dont you boss
GARRISONS CONFERENCE ROOM - ANOTHER DAY The staff is assembled We see the headline in the Times-
Picayune which says FERRIE CALLS GARRISON PROBE A WITCH
HUNT

LOU
Boss I tell you something or somebody
is putting tremendous heat on David
Ferrie If we sit on our behinds
any longer I dont think the guys
going to hold on

SUSIE
(raps the newspaper)
Look at this bullshit He keeps
changing what he says We cant
possibly call him to a Grand Jury

JIM
Susie watch the language would you
please

AL

My instinct is that Ferrie is going
to keep on deteriorating and well
end up getting more out of him when
he finally cracks If we call him
now he might freeze up and we could
lose the best shot weve ever had

LOU
You dont get it guys - he cant go
down any further We got to protect
him full time

JIM
(crises looks at his
watch)
I have a plane to catch going to

Washington An interesting lead

says hes closely connected to these
events but he wont come down here
I know what youre going through

with Ferrie Lou Well talk
tomorrow

LOU
Im onto Ferries Cuban paymaster
Eladio del Valle in Miami I gotta
get him in boss I need more men -
I cant even pull the teams to watch
Ferrie This is our case

Numa rushes in with a young investigator Williams -
displaying a miniature microphone

NUMA
HOLD IT CHIEF

JIM
(to Lou)
You just need some sleep Lou It
wont look so bad when

Numa makes violent signals to shut up - not to talk - sticking
the microphone in front of Jim Williams searches the walls
for the bug Numa signals everyone outside

GARRISONS MAIN OFFICE
The staff comes out into the office
with Him disturbed

JIM
What the hell is

NUMA
Williams found this in your office
We think the conference room is also
bugged And maybe the phones The
whole place needs debugging

The whole staff from the conference room reacts Jim looks
stunned
JIM
I dont believe it

SUSIE
Bugging the District Attorneys office
of New Orleans Its outrageous

Sharon has been standing there trying to get Lous attention

SHARON
Its urgent for you Mr Ivon

Lou goes to the phone

NUMA
Well believe what you want boss
but we got to be more careful All
these new volunteers any one of
them could be

JIM
Okay you handle it Numa I dont
have time for this nonsense
(to the hidden mikes
loudly)
Weve obviously got the bastards
worried now Im going to Washington

Everyone laughs but the camera goes to the look of shock on
Lous face as he holds the receiver They all look over at
him feeling the bad news before they hear it

LOU
Dave Ferries dead The body was
found at his apartment two hours
ago

Jims look says There goes the case
OUTSIDE FERRIES APARTMENT - FRENCH QUARTER Jim and his staff storm into the area which is cordoned off
by police

Members of the press are all over yelling questions at Jim

JIM

(to chief police

officer)
This case is in our jurisdiction I
dont want anyone from a Federal
agency in here without an explicit
Federal court order You got that
Hank

(Hank looks at him

weirdly)
NEWSMAN 10
Was Ferrie murdered Mr Garrison
Do you have any leads

INSIDE FERRIES APARTMENT

The apartment is filthy and sinister Hundreds of mice squeal
in their cages upset by the invasion of men and light
Nothing seems to have been washed in years There is an
accumulation of furniture college pennants photos of young
boys in training books everywhere ammunition guns a piano
maps fake college degrees on the walls Ferries naked

body lies on the couch with a sheet over it He is unwigged
his eyebrows unpainted false teeth next to him Jim studies
the corpse as the coroner comes alongside

JIM
Whats it look like Nick

CORONER
I dont see any violence Jim Heart
attack maybe an aneurysm Looks
like natural causes

Jim picks several empty capless medicine bottles on a table
next to the sofa and looks at them Lou and Bill come over
with a typed suicide note

BILL
Its addressed to no one and no
signature To leave this life is

for me a sweet prospect I find
nothing in it that is desirable and
on the other hand everything that
is loathsome

LOU
Pretty flowery for Dave Ferrie

The words from the note hang there weirdly as Jim paces on
into the apartment one of them medicine bottles in his hand
The music grows and a sinister feel of danger and death
pervades the atmosphere Then the sounds drop away

FERRIES BEDROOM
Jim hands Lou the medicine bottle

LOU
Proloid

JIM
I took it once for a low thyroid
condition

(he walks away)
It raises the metabolism Lou
CLOSET IN

(pause)
Did David Ferrie strike you as the
kind of person who had a low
metabolism

LOU
Id say the opposite - hypertension

FERRIES APARTMENT

Jim runs an eye through Daves closet cluttered with shabby

jackets

His eye falls on a neat but faded lace and satin some sort
of garment of priestly origin he takes it in his hand

Susie Cox

JIM
Ferrie was the only one to express
some kind of remorse about this whole
thing I think it got him killed

walks in a new message written on her face

SUSIE
Boss we just got bad news from Miami
They found Ferries Cuban friend -
Eladio del Valle - this morning
hacked to death with a machete in
his car He was tortured shot in
the heart at point-blank range and
his skull was split open with an
axe

LOU
Jesus - if that aint the Devils
piss Those bastards

Jims mood darkens and he heads back into the living room

as Ferrie

s corpse is being trundled out the door The

sickness is everywhere an oppressive mood Bill comes up

BILL
Found another note same thing no
name no signature When you receive

this I will be quite dead so no
answer will be possible I offered
you love All I got in return in
the end was a kick in the teeth

JIM
Jesus they mustve been hard pressed
to come up with that one

Jim feeling ill wanting to leave stops the coroner before

he exits
JIM
(gives the coroner
the empty bottle)
Nick what would happen if a man
suffering from hypertension were to
take an entire bottle of Proloid

CORONER
Hed die pretty quick either a heart
storm or a ruptured blood vessel in
the brain

JIM
Can you ascertain if theres Proloid
in his system

CORONER
Not in a routine autopsy but if we
looked at the spinal fluid there
might be a high level of iodine but
its difficult to know Whatcha
thinkin Jim

JIM
Well it doesnt make sense Nick -
he was afraid of dying then he kills
himself in a way that leaves no trace
but he leaves two unsigned suicide
notes

CORONER
(shrugs skeptical)
If its a suicide I seen weirder
Jim
(exits)

BILL
The fact is hes gone chief and
sos our case

LOU
Not unless we go for Shaw now

BILL
With whose testimony Willie OKeefe
A male prostitute Jack Martini A
drunk Vernon Bundy A dope fiend
Shaws got respect the newspaper
editors the American Bar Association -
theyre not

SUSIE
Im afraid Im with Bill on this
one We havent got the goods yet

LOU
We wait Shaws gonna get whacked
Oswald Ruby Ferrie del Valle
Banister Bowers how many corpses
you lawyers gotta see to figure out
whats going on

JIM
All right all right Break it up

BILL
Where you going boss

JIM
I dont know Bill I just dont
know

OUTSIDE FERRIES APARTMENT THAT SAME NIGHT

As Jim questioned by reporters gets in his car and leaves
Bill waves goodbye to Lou and walks toward his own car
dejected The area is cordoned off and humming with activity
Frank an FBI man who knows Bill from previous cases
approaches him out of the crowd He wears a hat suit and
tie

Bill

BILL
Hey where yat Frank Youre
wasting your time here Big Jim
gave strict orders No FBI allowed

FRANK
Its you I want to talk to Bill

BILL
(laughs)
Boss would fry me in hog fat if he
knew
(motions to car)

FRANK
(getting in the car)
Your boss got a serious problem
Bill Real serious We know whats
been going on at your office

BILL
(smiles)
Yeah I guess you do

FRANK
Youve got nothin Bill Im talking
as a friend now Youre riding on
the Titanic Time to jump off before
you get destroyed along with Garrison

BILL
Frank I dont want to hear it

FRANK
Senator Long set your boss up my
friend

This gets Bills attention

FRANK
Who do you think fed him that
information Garrisons going down
Were talking your career here Bill
your life Youre a young guy we
know youre working that Castro thing

BILL
No Im not

FRANK

Yes you are Look we know Oswald
didnt pull that trigger Castro
did But if that comes out theres
gonna be a war boy - millions of
people are gonna die Thats a hell
of a lot more important than Jim
Garrison

(suddenly)
Goddammit look at me when I talk to
you Youre too goddamn self-
opinionated now shut up If you
got a brain in that thick skull of
yours listen to me Listen real
hard

Bill taken aback listens
WASHINGTON DC - PARK Jim walks down from the Lincoln Memorial where he is met
unobtrusively by a military man in his 50s in casual
clothing hat on his head an erect posture They walk
towards the Mall with the Capitol building looming in the
background

x
Jim Garrison

JIM
Yes

x
(shakes hands)
Im glad you came Im sorry about
the precautions

JIM
Well I just hope it was worth my
while Mr

The man doesnt answer Jim after his meeting with Miller
and loss of Ferrie is testy and suspicious

D4
I could give you a false name but I
wont Just call me X

JIM
Ive already been warned by the
Agency Mr Whoever If this is
another type of threat I dont

D4
Im not with the Agency Mr Garrison
and I assume if youve come this
far what I have to say interests
you But Im not going to name names
or tell you who or what I represent
Except to say - youre close youre
closer than you think

Something about his manner speaks of authority knowledge
and above all old-fashioned honesty - the eyes looking at
you straight on He indicates a bench

D4

Everything Im going to tell you is
classified top secret

(significant look
I was a soldier Mr Garrison Two
wars I was one of those secret
guys in the Pentagon that supplies
the military hardware - the planes
bullets rifles - for what we call
black operations - black ops
assassinations coup detats rigging
elections propoganda psych warfare
and so forth World War II - Rumania
Greece Yugoslavia I helped take
the Nazi intelligence apparatus out
to help us fight the Communists
Italy 48 stealing elections France
49 breaking strikes - we overthrew
Quirino in the Philippines Arbenz
in Guatemala Mossadegh in Iran
Vietnam in 54 Indonesia 58 Tibet
59 we got the Dalai Lama out - we
were good very good Then we got
into the Cuban thing Not so good
Set up all the bases for the invasion
supposed to take place in October
62 Khrushchev sent the missiles
to resist the invasion Kennedy
refused to invade and we were standing
out there with our dicks in the wind
Lot of pissed-off people Mr
Garrison you understand Ill come
to that later I spent much of
September 63 working on the Kennedy
plan for getting all US personnel
out of Vietnam by the end of 65
This plan was one of the strongest
and most important papers issued
from the Kennedy White House Our
first 1000 troops were ordered home
for Christmas Tensions were high
In November 63 one week after the
murder of Vietnamese President Diem
in Saigon and two weeks before the
assassination of our President

FLASHBACK TO the Pentagon offices in 1963 xX strides down a
busy hall and into the offices of one of his superiors Major
General Y a lean cold warrior battlefield handsome
civilian clothes and several advisors Theres a US flag
on the wall The status of Y is only clear by the sing on
the desk the name blocked by a passing figure

D4

a strange thing happened I was
sent by my superior officer call
him Y to the South Pole as the
military escort for a group of
international VIPs This trip had
nothing to do with my nine years of
work in Special Operations It was
sort of a paid vacation

We hear vague ad-lib mutterings on the soundtrack indicating
a friendly atmosphere and we see stock footage of a C-130
transport flying to Antarctica and ice floes on the surface
of the sea

Then at a New Zealand airport we see X in a uniform at a
newsstand reading of Kennedys assassination The banner
headline of an Extra edition of The Christchurch Star
screams out KENNEDY SHOT DEAD

D4
It wasnt until I was on my way back
in New Zealand that I read of the
Presidents murder That was 2 in
the afternoon the next day New Zealand
time but already the papers had the
entire history of an unknown 24-year-
old man Oswald - a studio picture
detailed biographical data Russian
information - and were pretty sure

of the fact hed killed the President
alone although it took them four
more hours to charge him with the
murder in Texas It felt as if
well a cover story was being put

out like we would in a black op

Back at the Pentagon office we see X returning and meeting
Y The atmosphere is cordial but Y is slightly different
from before - more harried more nervous He turns away to
light a cigarette he doesnt want the usual conversation

D4
Anyway after I came back I asked
myself why was I the chief of special
ops selected to travel to the South
Pole at that time to do a job that
any number of others could have done
One of my routine duties if I had
been in Washington wouldve been to
arrange for additional security in
Texas The Secret Service is
relatively small and by custom the
military will augment them I checked
it out when I got back and sure
enough I found out someone had told
the 112th Military Intelligence Group
at 4th Army Headquarters at Fort Sam
Houston to stand down that day
over the protests of the unit
Commander a Colonel Reich

We see an outdoor shot of the Texas Army Headquarters on a
day in 1963 Inside on the same day Col Reich is on the
phone puzzled

D4
Now this is significant because it
is standard operating procedure
especially in a known hostile city
like Dallas to supplement the Secret
Service Even if we had not allowed
the bubbletop to be removed from the
limousine wedve put at least 100
to 200 agents on the sidewalks
without question Thered already
been several attempts on de Gaulles
life in France Only a month before
in Dallas UN Ambassador Adlai
Stevenson had been spit on and hit
Wed have arrived days ahead of time
studied the route checked all the
buildings
We never wouldve allowed all those
wide-open empty windows overlooking

Dealey never We would have
had our own snipers covering the
area The moment a window went up

theyd have been on the radio We
wouldve been watching the crowds -
packages rolled up newspapers a
coat over an arm never would have
let a man open an umbrella along the
way - Never wouldve allowed that
limousine to slow down to 10 miles
per hour much less take that unusual
curve at Houston and Elm You would
have felt an Army presence in the
streets that day but none of this
happened It was a violation of the
most basic protection codes we have
And it is the best indication of a
massive plot in Dallas Who could
have best done that People in my
business Mr Garrison People like
my superior officer couldve told
Col Reich Look - we have another
unit coming from so and so providing
security Youll stand down That
day in fact there were some
individual Army Intelligence people
in Dallas and Im still trying to
figure out who and why But they
werent protecting the client One
of them by the way was caught in
the Book Depository after police
sealed it off

In Dealey Plaza 1963 we see an Army intelligence man taking
a shot with a Minolta camera

D4

Army Intell had a Harvey Lee Oswald
on file but all those files have
been destroyed Many strange things
were happening that day and Lee
Harvey Oswald had nothing to do with
em We had the entire Cabinet on
trip to the Far East We hada
ird of a combat division returning
rom Germany in the air above the
nited States at the time of the
ooting and at 1234 PM the
ntire telephone system went dead in
ashington for a solid hour and on
e plane back to Washington word
as radioed from the White House
ituation Room to Lyndon Johnson

at one individual performed the
assassination Does that sound like

tner SO0nN Ghetto
a bunch of coincidences to you Mr
Garrison Not for one moment The
cabinet was out of the country to

get their perception out of the way
The troops were in the air for
ossible riot control The phones
idnt work to keep the wrong stories
rom spreading if anything went wrong
ith the plan Nothing was left to
ance I bet you there were even
ackup teams and cars on the other
ide of the underpass in the event

at Kennedy got through wounded

ey would have moved in with vehicles
like they did with de Gaulle He
could not be allowed to escape alive

Hot wvnoaematd

The camera is on Jim listening This information is much
greater than he ever envisioned and he is stunned X pauses

D4
I never though things were the same
after that Vietnam started for
real There was an air of I dont
know make-believe in the Pentagon
and the CIA Those of us whod been
in secret ops since the beginning
knew the Warren Commission was
fiction but there was something
deeper uglier And I knew Allen
Dulles very well I briefed him
many a time in his house He was
also General Ys benefactor But
for the life of me I still cant
figure out why Dulles was appointed
to investigate Kennedys death The
man who had fired him I got out in
64 I retired from the US Air
Force

JACKIE KENNEDY
I never realized Kennedy was so
dangerous to the establishment Is
that why

D4
(chuckles)
Thats the real question isnt it -
Why - the how is just scenery
or the suckers Oswald Ruby
uba Mafia it keeps people guessing
ike a parlor game but it prevents
em from asking the most important
uestion - Why Why was Kennedy
illed Who benefitted Who has
e€ power to cover it up You

tAVnQtreat
know in 61 right after the Bay of
Pigs - very few people know about
this - I participated in drawing up
National Security Action Memos 55
56 and 57 These are crucial
documents classified top secret

but basically in them Kennedy
instructs General Lemnitzer Chairman
of the Joint Chiefs that from here
on forward

FLASHBACK TO the Pentagon offices on a day in 1961

A

document is moved by hand into Lemnitzers office where we
see a set of hands holding it while its read Theres a

look of surprise on Lemnitzers face

D4

the Joint Chiefs of Staff would
be wholly responsible for all covert
paramilitary action in peacetime
is basically ended the reign of
e CIA - splintered it as JFK
romised he would into a thousand
ieces - and now was ordering the
ilitary to help This was
nprecedented I cant tell you the
ock waves this sent along the
orridors of power in Washington
is and of course firing Allen
ulles Richard Bissell and General
arles Cabell all of them sacred
cows of Intell since World War II
You got some very upset people here

QuHQaneE BDU GAH

DOCUMENTARY IMAGES flash on the screen - Allen Dulles sweet-
faced smiling at the Warren Commission Hearing and visiting
Dealey Plaza General Charles Cabell and Richard Bissell

D4
Kennedys directives were never really
implemented because of bureaucratic
resistance but one of the results
was that the Cuban operation was
turned over to my department as
Operation Mongoose which meant
that people like my superior officer
General Y took over the Cuban
personnel that were being trained to
invade Cuba - and the bases like the
training camp at Pontchartrain in
your home state that were closed
down by Kennedy and thats how
the black ops people people like
General Y ended up taking the rules
of covert warfare theyd used abroad
and broughtem into this country
Now they had the people the

equipment bases and the motivation
check out an old CIA man Bill Harvey -
ran something called Executive
Action which carried out foreign
assassinations Harvey was also
involved with the fake defection
program that got Oswald into Russia
Check out the Cabell brothers
Interesting links to this case

At Arlington Cemetery on the same day Jim visits the grave
of President Kennedy We see the eternal flame Jim thinks
about what he should do now The size of it stuns him He
is lost reeling back to the past in his mind

DISSOLVE TO DOCUMENTARY FOOTAGE of Dachau concentration camp
thousands of bodies are piled and bulldozed And then back

to Jim at Arlington Cemetery reliving it only the enormity
of past evil can prepare him to confront present evil Ina

strange way it reassures him

D4
dont underestimate the budget
cuts Kennedy called for in March of
63 either - close to 52 military
installations in 25 states 21
overseas bases youre talking big
money You know how many helicopters
have been lost in Vietnam About
three thousand so far Who makes
them Bell Helicopter Who owns
Bell Bell was near bankruptcy when
the First National Bank of Boston
approached the CIA about developing
the helicopter for Indochina usage
How bout the f-111 fighters General
Dynamics in Fort Worth Who owns
that Find out the defense budget
since the war began 75 going ona
hundred billion 200 billionll
be spent before it ends In 1950 it
was 13 billion No war no money
Sometimes I think the organizing
principle of any society is for war
The authority of the state over its
people resides in its war powers
Even Eisenhower - military hero of
WWII - warned us about it beware
the military - industrial complex
he said Kennedy wanted to end the
Cold War in his second term He
wanted to call of the moon race in
favor of cooperation with the Soviets
He signed a treaty with the Soviets
to ban nuclear testing he refused

to invade Cuba in 62 and he set
out to withdraw from Vietnam But
that all ended on November 22 1963

FLASHBACK TO the White House 1963 Lyndon Johnson is with
Henry Cabot Lodge We see them as shadowy figures from a
distance across the wide room or near a veranda with a porch
and plenty of light Johnson his back to us talks ina
loud thick Texas drawl (mostly muted) and signs a document

x
Only four days after JFK was shot
Lyndon Johnson signed National
Security Memo 273 which essentially
reversed Kennedys new withdrawal
policy and gave the green light to
the covert operations against North
Vietnam that provoked the Gulf of
Tonkin incident In that document
lay the Vietnam War

In the park with X Jim is staggered by all this information
X ceases walking and looks at Jim

JIM
I dont I cant believe it They
killed him because he wanted to change
things In our time - in our country

x
(shrugging)
Kings are killed Mr Garrison
Politics is power nothing more
But dont believe me Dont trust

me Do your own work your own
thinking

JIM
The size of this is beyond me
Testify

x

No chance in hell Mr Garrison

Id be arrested and gagged declared
insane and hospitalized maybe
worse You too I can only give
you background you got to find the
foreground the little things
Keep digging Yknow youre the
only person to ever bring a trial in
the murder of John Kennedy Thats
important - its historic

JIM
I havent yet I dont have much of
a case
x

(rising to leave)
But you dont have a choice anymore
Youve become a significant threat
to the national security structure
They wouldve killed you already
but you got a lot of light on you
Instead theyre gonna destroy your
credibility they already have in
many circles in this town Youre
some kinda ego-crazed southern
caricature to many folks Be honest -
the best chance you got is come up
with a case something anything
make arrests stir the shitstorm
You gotta hope to reach a point of
critical mass where other people
will come forward and the government
will crack Remember fundamentally
people are suckers for the truth
and the truth is on your side bubba
I hope you get a break

Jim watches this mystery man walking away The figure
vanishes in the Washington breeze Flags flap over some
distant memorial to some distant history of the Republic
Jim rises a decision made

EXTERIOR OF CLAY SHAWS HOUSE - NEW ORLEANS Jim Lou Al Numa and several policemen stand at the door
as Clay Shaw comes to it

LOU
Mr Shaw youre under arrest charged
with conspiracy and entering into an
agreement with other persons for the
specific purpose of committing the
crime of murder of President John F
Kennedy in violation of

The voice dropping away as the devastated look on Shaws
face spreads sickly undone his arrogant public composure
gone face now filled with terror disbelief

LOU
we have a warrant to search the

The policemen take Shaw while the DA staff moves into the
carriage house past the butler Frankie Jenkins

INSIDE SHAWS HOUSE
In the bedroom Numa points out to
Jim the hooks screwed into the
ceiling Al pulls out five whips
several lengths of chain a black
hood and matching black cape Dried
blood is on one whip

of our business Lets keep this
side of it quiet shall we

When youre in a war boss you use

NEWSMAN 12
Mr Shaw - What do you have to say
MONTAGE - NEWSREEL MUSIC

We see a shot of the exterior of the Justice Department in

JUSTICE DEPARTMENT CONFERENCE ROOM

The acting Attorney General speaks to the press

ATTORNEY GENERAL
Yes Mr Shaw was included in our
investigation and there was no
connection found at all between Shaw
and the Presidents assassin

GARRISONS OFFICE - CONFERENCE ROOM Jim confronts a packed room Bill is with him

JIM
If Mr Shaw had no connection to the
assassination why did the FBI
investigate him And why if they
did is his name not mentioned once
in the entire 26 volumes of the Warren
Report even it if is to clear his
name I doubt this Attorney General
would qualify for my staff

We see a shot of the Supreme Court building in Washington
DC and then a corridor inside the building A Chief
Justice looking gray and wise like Earl Warren moves along
the corridor in his black robe delivering his verdict to the
press

CHIEF JUSTICE
No I dont think so Mr Garrison
has presented absolutely nothing
publicly to contradict our findings
As yet I have not heard one fact to
refute the Commission determination
that Lee Oswald was the lone killer

In his own office Jim responds to Justice Warren

JIM
I congratulate Mr Shaw Most
witnesses have to wait for trial
before theyre allowed to produce
sacred cows like the Chief Justice
of the land as a character witness
who is of course not under oath and
free from the laws of perjury

NEWSMAN 13
Mr Garrison if what you say is
even partly true in this case you
realize you are damaging the
credibility of our government
possibly destroying it

JIM
Let me ask you is a government
worth preserving when it lies to the
people It has become a dangerous
country sir when you cant trust
anyone anymore when you cant tell
the truth I say let justice be
done though the heavens fall

It doesnt play with the press They shuffle off quiet
whispering

GARRISONS HOUSE Liz and Jim watch silently devastated as the NBC WHITE
PAPER unfolds attacking Jim They can do nothing Liz
leaves the room upset

husband a prosperous Republican businessman watches from
the corner Jim - along with Al - has her testimony in front

JIM
In the sheriffs report Mrs Mercer
it says you were at Dealey Plaza two
hours before the assassination but
that

MERCER
Yes it was about 11 in the morning
I was driving west on Elm Street
toward the Triple Underpass ina
rented car - a blue Valiant Ill
never forget that day

FLASHBACK TO Dealey Plaza in 1963 Its a normal scene -
cars traffic people starting to arrive for Kennedys
appearance We catch a glimpse of Julia Ann Mercer 23
driving then stopping traffic

MERCER

there was quite a bit of traffic
and I was stopped alongside a green
pickup truck It was very noticeable
because it was blocking traffic and
it was parked with two wheels on the
curb When I saw the gun I thought -
the Secret Service is not very secret
She glances over at the man in the drivers seat Its Jack
Ruby wearing a green jacket Then she sees a young white
man in his mid - 20s in a gray jacket brown pants plaid
shirt and wool stocking hat getting out of the passenger
side going to the rear of the van opening a tool compartment
and removing a package that looks like a rifle wrapped in
paper He walks up the embankment in the direction of the
picket fence Ruby looks over and stares at Julia Ann who
turns away and notices three police officers standing near a
motorcycle on the overpass bridge Her eyes lock with Rubys
a second time and as the traffic moves she drives on

MERCER
The next morning Saturday I went
to the FBI office and the agents
showed me photographs

In the Dallas FBI office Mercer sits at a table looking at
photos Two FBI agents stand near her showing her photos
She shakes her head no several times until they put a
shot of Jack Ruby in front of her She holds it up

MERCER

I picked out three pictures that
looked generally like the driver of
the truck and then

MERCER
Thats the man

FBI AGENT
(to Second Agent)
Jack Ruby

SECOND AGENT
What about these others You said
they might be him

MERCER
They look a little like him But
no
(holding up the Ruby
photo)
Im sure this is the man

Back in the present Jim continues to question Mercer

JIM
You mean you identified him on
Saturday the day before Ruby shot
Oswald

MERCER
Thats right When I saw him on TV
I was shocked I said to my family
that was the man I saw in the truck

JIM
(skeptical)
But you didnt seem nearly so sure
in your statement to the Warren
Commission

MERCER
Thats what bothers me Mr Garrison
You see theyve been altered My
statements

Jim is silent Mercer picks up the report and finds the
pertinent paragraphs

MERCER
This says Mercer could not identify
any of the photographs as being
identical with the person she had
observed slouched over the wheel of
a green Ford pickup truck Thats
not true I recognized him and I
told them so They also said it
was a dark green air conditioning
truck which it was not And here
(she goes to another
report)

on the Dallas Sheriffs report
This is really strange See that
notarized signature on the bottom of
each page Thats not my signature
And there never was any notary present
during any of my questioning

(she hands the papers
back to Jim)
I guess thats all

JIM
Mrs Mercer as a former FBI man
its difficult to accept this

MERCER
I know but Mr Garrison the FBI is
just not doing their job

HUSBAND
Im a Republican Mr Garrison and
I dont go in for this kind of
government bashing but I must tell
you somethings not right when they
dont even bother to call Julia in
front of the Warren Commission

JIM
They didnt call a lot of people
Mr Mercer I think its safe to
say the Warren Report is a work of
fiction

DALLAS CLUB - NIGHT BEVERLY

face ex-club singer

a woman of ample proportions and a big
meets with Jim and Lou Ivon ina

nightclub not unlike Rubys Carousel

Jada and Beverly sit down at the table with Ferrie

and Jack
anything

LOU
Beverly tell Mr Garrison about the
Carousel club

BEVERLY (VO)
Oh yes I used to go over there a
lot to see Jack and especially my
friend Jada who danced there It
was the real swinging spot in town
Everybody came Businessmen
politicians from Austin Lyndon
Johnsons friends Dallas was a
slow town back then You chewed
toothpicks played dominos spit and
dated policemen But Jacks was
exciting There were always cops
there Jack liked em around but
he used to throw the drunks out
himself cause he was kinda a violent-
tempered man it seemed everybody
in those days knew Jack was with the
Mob The cops were bad back then -
theyd shake you down for the money
in your pocket They put a lotta
people in the cemetery especially
colored people

LOU
Beverly what about Lee

cute Texas

Oswald

with Jack doing the buying Its too loud to hear

BEVERLY (VO)

Oh yeah One time I came in Jack
introduces me to these two guys He
said Beverly this is my friend
Lee and I didnt catch the other
guys name He was a weird-looking
guy with those funny little eyebrows
The other guy Lee didnt make much
of an impression either He wasnt
good-looking or nuthin he didnt
look like he had any money and he
was in a bad mood so I didnt pay

him much mind Well I might not
remember a name but I always remember
a face When I saw him tow weeks
later on the television I screamed
Oh my God - thats him Thats
Jacks friend I knew right then
it had something to do with the
Mafia Well about a week later
after she told the newspapers shed
met this guy Lee with Jack Jada
disappears off the face of the
Earth

THE CAMERA MOVES IN ON JADA

BEVERLY (VO)
Never knew what happened to her till
Herman offered to sell me her
wardrobe I said but Jadas coming
back and I remember the way he
smiled and I knew she was never
coming back

BACK TO the 1967 scene

JIM
Will you testify Beverly

BEVERLY
I dont think so sir

LOU
I thought when we came here we had
an agreement

BEVERLY
I just dont want to become another
statistic like her If they can
kill the President do you think
theyre gonna think twice about a
two-bit showgirl like me

LOU
We could call you in Beverly

JIM
I know the pressure youre under
Beverly Dont think I dont
(as he exits)
I understand

DISSOLVE TO DEALEY PLAZA Our view is from the roof of the building on the extreme

south side of the Plaza JC Price the building engineer
in hat and overalls points for Jim and Lou
PRICE (VO)
yes Sir right here on this spot
The shots came from near that wooden
fence over there near the overpass

The camera tightens on the picket fence

PRICE
I saw a man run from this spot and
go behind the Book Depository - 30
minutes later I gave this information
to the Sheriff

On the overpass near Dealey Plaza SM Holland a tan
elderly leather-faced signal supervisor points to the picket
fence for Jim and Lou His accent is thick and rural We

saw him before briefly when Jim was reading the Warren
Report

HOLLAND
I made it very clear to the Warren
people one of the shots came from
behind that picket fence I heard
the report and saw the smoke come
out about 6 or 8 feet above the
ground right out from under those
trees There is no doubt whatsoever
in my mind

FLASHBACK TO the restaged shooting The smoke hangs under
the trees

CUT TO Richard Dodd on the overpass Hes a cowboy type
with a hat and an even thicker accent than Holland

DODD
(pointing)

we all four of us all railroad
men standing here seen about the
same thing The smoke came from
behind the hedge - and a motorcycle
policeman dropped his cycle in the
street and run up the embankment

FLASHBACK to the motorcycle

BACK TO 1967 Jim and Lou walk with Dodd and Holland near
the picket fence We feel the emptiness of the area now and
see the normal amount of traffic driving by

HOLLAND
we came around here to look for
tracks It rained that morning and
we found a bunch of cigarette butts
Someoned been standing about here
The camera shows the spot and Lou sighting

LOU
This is a good spot chief for the
head shot

Jim looks reliving the moment

Later Jim and Lou stand on the south side of Elm Street in
Dealey Plaza talking to Jean Hill an attractive 30-ish
teacher Her demeanor has a rock-solid Texas back-country
conviction to it shes a woman not easily frightened

JEAN HILL
I was standing here next to my friend
Mary Mooman who took the photograph
when he was killed

We see a flash of the Moorman photograph - a blurry Polaroid
with the President in the foreground and the picket fence in
background We will return to this photograph in more detail
later

JEAN HILL
I jumped out in the street and yelled
Hey Mr President look over here
we wanna take your picture He
looked up and then shots rang out
Mary fell to the ground right away
shouting Get down theyre shooting
get down theyre shooting I knew
it but I was moving to get closer to
him The driver had stopped - I
dont know what was wrong with that
driver And then out of the corner
of my eye I saw this flash of light
in the bushes and that last shot
just ripped his head off I mean
blood brains just blew everything

FLASHBACK TO the day of the shooting We hear the sound of
shots and see the Grassy Knoll from Jeans point of view

JEAN HILL
I looked up and saw smoke from the
Knoll And everything was frozen -
seemed like people wasnt even
breathing like youre looking at a
picture - except this one guy I
saw this one guy running from the
Book Depository towards the railroad
tracks And that was the same man I
saw on TV two days later shooting
Oswald That was Jack Ruby No
question about it
Blurry image - were not at all sure what or who or if
but a seed is planted We see smoke - the same smoke Bowers
saw then Jack Ruby in a brown coat running from the Book
Depository toward the railroad tracks Then we see Jeans
view as she runs toward the Knoll along with others there
are yells shouts and general confusion

JEAN HILL
It was him I was chasing up the Grassy
Knoll thinking our guys had shot
back and maybe we got one of them
I dont know what I would have done
if I had caught him but I knew
something terrible had happened and
somebody had to do something

At the picket fence we see blurry images of police officers
railroad workers cigarette butts buddy footprints
confusion

JEAN HILL
I never did catch him All I saw in
that parking area were railroad
workers and Dallas finest

Two Secret Service types approach her suddenly and one of
them puts an arm on her shoulder

FIRST AGENT
Secret Service maam Youre coming
with us

JEAN HILL
Oh no Im not I dont know you
We gotta catch this shooter - dont
you realize

SECOND AGENT
(grabbing her other
shoulder)
I said youre coming with us I
want the pictures in your pocket

JEAN HILL (VO)
»-he put a hurt on me but good

JEAN HILL
I dont have any pictures I have
to go back and find my friend Mary
Lemme alone

The two agents hustle her away

FIRST AGENT
Hush Just smile and keep walking
Hill 32 years old that day is shown into a third floor
office of the County Courts Building - which has a view of
the assassination area Other Secret Service agents are
there Some 18 people are detained there

TIME CUT TO two men interrogating Hill

JEAN HILL (VO)
These new people never identified
themselves They musta been watching
the whole thing cause they knew
everything Mary and me had been doing
that day I guess I wasnt too hard
to find - wearing that red raincoat

MAN
How many shots you say you heard

JEAN HILL
Four to six

MAN
Thats impossible You heard echoes
echoes We have three bullets
and three shots which came from the
Book Depository and thats all were
willing to say

JEAN HILL (VO)
-which is strange cause this is
less than 20 minutes after the
assassination

JEAN HILL
No I saw a guy shooting from over
there He was behind that fence
What are you going to do about it

MAN
We have that taken care of You
only heard three shots and you are
not to talk to anyone about this
No one you hear

JEAN HILL (VO)
I was scared It was all kinda queer
but it sure felt like two and two
was coming up three and then they
took Marys five snapshots from me
sent them to Washington and when
they returned them weeks later two
of them had the backgrounds
mutilated The only one we saved
was in Marys camera I didnt want
to go to Washington when the Warren
Commission subpoenaed me so the
lawyer come down here and interviewed
me at Parkland Hospital

In a Parkland Hospital office in 1964 a lawyer interviews
Jean Hill A female stenographer takes notes

JEAN HILL
He asked me why I thought I was in
danger and I said

JEAN HILL
Well if they can kill the President
they can certainly get me

LAWYER
That doesnt make sense Mrs Hill
We have the man that killed the
President

JEAN HILL
No you dont

JEAN HILL
He kept trying to get me to change
my story about the shots He was
getting hot under the collar and
telling the woman not to write when
he wanted

JEAN HILL
Look do you want the truth or just
what you want me to say

LAWYER
I want the truth

JEAN HILL
The truth is that I heard between
four and six shots Im not going
to lie for you

LAWYER
-you heard echoes

JEAN HILL
No I had guns all my life I used
to go turtle shooting

LAWYER
I realize youre under a great deal
of stress its clouded your

judgement

JEAN HILL (VO)
So off the record he starts talking
about my family and even mentioned
my marriage was in trouble like I
didnt know it or something He got
angrier and angrier and then

LAWYER
Look we can put you in a mental
institution We can make you look
craziern Marguerite Oswald and
everybody knows how crazy she is

JEAN HILL (VO)
I knew something was crooked as a
dogs hind leg cause no one who is
just taking a deposition gets that
involved and angry sure enough
when I finally read my testimony as
published by the Warren Commission
it was a fabrication from start to
finish

JIM
Are you willing to testify Mrs
Hill

Back at the Knoll

JEAN HILL
(without hesitation)
Damned right I would Somebodys
got to tell the truth around here
cause the Government sure aint
doing it

DISSOLVE TO a scene inside the Texas School Book Depository
Jim and Lou walk the floor and look out the windows
Lou has a Mannlicher-Carcano in his hand with a sight and
clip We see Oswalds supposed view of the limousine as he

in 1967

pulls the

Lou cocks

Lou assumes the Oswald pose

out

Lou pulls

trigger Now innocuous traffic goes by
iris of the camera tightens into a snipers scope

LOU
The Zapruder film establishes 3 shots
in 56 seconds Here Im Oswald
Time me

but the

the Mannlicher for the first shot Jim looks at
this watch

JIM
Go

crouched at the window aiming

quickly recharges the bolt fires recycles fires
Time

JIM
Between six and seven seconds

LOU

The key is the second and third shots
came right on top of each other and
it takes a minimum 23 seconds to
recycle this thing

(he recycles the bolt

for firing)
The other problem is there was a
tree right there

(he points)
Blocking the first two shots at the
time they occur in the Zapruder film

JIM
Didnt Hoover say something about
that The leaves had fallen off in
November

LOU

It was a Texas Live Oak boss

(he shakes his head)
It sheds its leaves the first week
of March You try to hit a moving
target at 88 yards through heavy
foliage with this cheap 13-dollar
sucker the worlds worst shoulder
weapon No way The FBI tried two
sets of tests and not one of their
arpshooters could match Oswalds
erformance Not one And Oswald
as at best a medium shot The scope
as defective on it too I mean
is is the whole essence of the
ase to me The guy couldnt do the
ooting Nobody could And they
old this lemon to the American
ublic

THnNAtTZEWTHU

JIM
The Zapruder film is the proof they
didnt count on Lou We gotta get
our hands on it

LOU
That means we gotta subpoena Time-
Life on it

JIM
(looks out the window)
Why not just shoot Kennedy coming up
Houston Theres plenty of time -
hes out in the open - a frontal
shot

Jim points the Carcano south right up Houston Street
following a car that happens to be passing by - a convertible
with an unknown woman driving

LOU
I asked myself the same thing Common
sense Even if you miss the first
shot if he accelerates you still
got him for a second shot No
the only reason for waiting to get
him on Elm is you got him ina
triangulated crossfire You got him
on a flat low trajectory from the
front at the fence there

The camera swings to the Grassy Knoll and the picket fence
as seen from the sixth floor of the Depository

LOU
you put a third team there - in
that building on a low floor

The camera swings to the Daltex Building across the street
LOU

When Kennedy gets to the kill zone
its a turkey shoot

JIM
(aiming)
How many men

LOU

One shooter One spotter on a radio
Maybe three teams Id say these
were professional riflemen chief
serious people Hunters patient
It takes skill to kill with a rifle
thats why theres been no execution
of an executive with one in 200

years 3-2-1 green
(he taps Jim on the
shoulder)

Or else Abort Abort

Jim pulls the dead trigger reliving the moment through the
scope on a passing car

LOU
Main Streets over there - the
original parade route on the way to
the Trade Mart Too far right
Impossible shot

Jim swings the scope up to confront Main Street Another
car is in his sight Too far

LOU
So they changed the route to bring
it this way

Moving at a normal 25 mph they knew the motorcade would
have to slow to about 10 miles per hour to make this turn

Thats where you get him

The camera swings to the Houston and Main intersection

JIM
Who do you think changed the parade
route

LOU

Beats me City officials Secret
Service Dallas police They dida
dry run with Chief Curry a few days
before But they didnt bother
running through Dealey They stopped
right there said something like
and afterwards theres only the
freeway and went home

JIM
You know who the mayor was

LOU
No

JIM
Earle Cabell And guess who his
brother is

Who

JIM
General Charles Cabell Deputy
Director of the CIA Fired by Kennedy
in 61 because of the Bay of Pigs
fiasco he moved back to the Pentagon
called Kennedy a traitor When he
came to New Orleans to address the
Foreign Policy Association you know
who introduced him Our friend Clay
Shaw

LOU
The Warren Commission call him
JIM
(shaking his head)
His boss was the one on the Warren
Commission who handled all the leads
to the intelligence community

LOU
Allen Dulles

JIM

(he nods)
Head of the CIA since 53 Kennedy
fired them both Cabell was his
deputy for nine years

(sickened)
Talk about the fox investigating the
chicken coop Now well have to
subpoena them Lou

LOU
Theyre gonna love you chief

Lou walks to another window in the empty Book Depository
where Oswald supposedly did his dirty deed and looks out
over the plaza with all its ghosts Jim and Lou are two
men - with only two mens power A terrible aloneness
pervades their minds

JIM
Maybe we should just call it a day
Lou Go home While were still a
little behind We got two people
killed maybe more we never thought
about

LOU
You never got anyone killed boss
Their actions killed them years
before If we stopped now itd be
even more wrong

FLASHBACK TO 1963 - the sixth floor of the Texas School Book
Depository - the same place Jim and Lou are now Jim looks
around and sees one shooter and one spotter with a lunchbox
radio in repairman clothes Jim is watching Neither of
these men is Oswald We hear the sounds of the motorcade
below The shooter pulls the trigger on the Carcano A
loud frightening sound snaps Jim back to the present

JIM
(in present)
Subpoena them Lou - Dulles the
Cabells Time-Life the whole damned
lot of ‘em
GARRISONS OFFICE - 9 MONTHS LATER - 1968

We see another smoke-filled conference of assistants
Paperwork is stacked in the corners almost to the ceiling
there are coffee cups and doughnuts on desks The
disorganization and lack of resources are apparent The
staff working on this project now numbers some eleven people
and there are some new investigators and assistants We
sense that the trial is drawing closer

AL
The US Attorney in Washington
declines to serve our subpoena on
Allen Dulles Charles Cabell CIA
Director Richard Helms or any FBI
agent we named

JIM
Well what do you expect from a pig
but a grunt

AL
Without them its going to be near
impossible chief to prove Shaws
connection to the CIA We got the
same problem with the governors
All of them Reagan in California
wont give us Brading Ohio refuses
Orville Townsend Texas on Arcacha
and Nebraska on Sandra Moffet

BILL
What the hell is going on Never
before has an extradition request
from this office been refused

AL
We havent tried to get Julia Anne
Mercer in

JIM
No she could get hurt If you
believe whats happening to these
other people

NUMA
Shes the best damn witness we have

JIM
I just dont want to do it What
else

Numa is opening another stack of letters The dollar bills
keep coming He points to two giant stacks of mail

NUMA
Hate mail here Fan mail here The
bad news is the IRS has just requested
an audit on your income from this
office

JIM

(he snorts)
I expected that two months ago and
theyre wasting their time The
bad news is the National Guard has
just asked me to resign after 18
years

(we see his hurt)
Well maybe thats good news - it
was never as good as combat but
this is Bill any more on Oswald
and Shaw

BILL
Yeah They were seen together in
Clinton in early September The
Civil Rights Movement was running a
voter registration drive

BILL
rumor is Shaw a local boy was
working on some arms deal to discredit
the civil rights movement No one
really knows what they were doing
there but everyone sure saw ‘em
They stood out like cottonballs I
got whites and blacks saw ‘em but
last time I checked there was nothing
illegal with registering to vote
We still got the Negro junkie Vernon
Bundy saw ‘em talkin at the seawall
near Lake Pontchartrain But its
tough boss - no one wants to talk
about Shaw Hes

LOU
(back to present)
You know you keep saying that

BILL
Keep saying what

LOU
Youre not digging

JIM
I think Clinton is a breakthrough
Shaw denies he knows Ferrie or Oswald
Is that right It proves hes a
liar Keep on it Bill
(a look from Lou)
SUSIE
This is interesting - are you ready
for this Oswald went to see the
FBI two weeks before the
assassination It seems Special
Agent Hosty made three routine visits
to his house supposedly to keep an
eye on Marina Oswald

FLASHBACK TO Dallas FBI Office in 1963 Oswald is at the
counter addressing the female receptionist

OSWALD
I want to see Special Agent Hosty

RECEPTIONIST
Im sorry hes not in Can someone
else help you

OSWALD
Can I use a pen

SUSIE (V0O)
He left a note Hosty told a Dallas
newspaperman it was a warning to him
to stop questioning Marina at their
home when Oswald was not present
She was not a citizen so possibly
he was threatening to deport her
back to Russia

TIMECUT TO FBI James Hosty confronting his agitated superior
FBI Agent Shanklin in one of his cubicles

SUSIE
But what the note really said no one
knows because his boss Shanklin told
Hosty

SHANKLIN

(reading the note)
Oswalds dead now Theres no trial
Get rid of it I dont even want
this in the office Get rid of it
Hosty

(he gives it back to

Hosty)

SUSIE (V0O)
Hosty tore it up and flushed it down
the toilet Waggoner Carr the
Attorney General of Texas says he
had evidence from the Dallas Sheriffs
office that Oswald had been employed
as an undercover informant for the
FBI at a salary of 200 a month
beginning more than a year before
the murder

JIM

(in present)
This is just speculation people
but what if the note was describing
the assassination attempt on JFK

(the staff seem

surprised by the

thought)
Come on guys think - thats the
only reason to destroy it because
if it was any kind of threat like
Hosty said they wouldve kept it
cause it makes their case against
the angry lone nut stronger
Remember the New Orleans meeting
with Agent Quigley the day he got
busted

FLASHBACK TO Oswald under arrest meeting with Quigley

JIM

there again Quigley destroyed the
notes of the meeting I think we
can raise the possibility that Oswald
not only was an informant but that
he may well have been the original
source for the telex we have dated
November 17 warning of the Kennedy
assassination in Dallas on November

Holds up the telex We see a close-up URGENT TO ALL SACS
FROM DIRECTOR

JIM
William Walter the night clerk on
duty here in the FBI office gave me
a copy of this It went all over
the country Nothing was done and
the motorcade went ahead on schedule -
and this wasnt even mentioned in
the Warren Report Read it Al

AL (V0O)
Threat to assassinate President
Kennedy in Dallas Texas November
22-23 Information received by the
Bureau has determined that a militant
revolutionary group may attempt to
assassinate President Kennedy on his
proposed trip to Dallas Texas etc
etc
FLASHBACK TO New Orleans FBI office in 1963 Walter the
night clerk receives the teletype reads it and runs it

JIM (VO)

shortly after the assassination
Walter says the telex was removed
from all the files in all cities as
an obvious embarrassment to the
Bureau I believe Oswald was sending
information through Hosty

FLASHBACK TO a Dallas safe house in 1963 Oswald Ruby and
several Cubans including the Bull and the Indian are talking

JIM
I have a hunch that from the get go
Oswald had infiltrated this group
probably Cubans or right-wing
extremists He was at the Boo
Depository that day told to be there
by their handlers either to prevent
the assassination or to take part in
it They coulda told him anything
either 1) they were going to close
down the plotters that day or 2)
they were going to fake an attack on
Kennedy to whip up public opinion
against Russia or Cuba and reverse
his policies - it doesnt really
matter what they told him cause he
was under orders he was a foot
soldier

Underneath the voice-over we hear and see Oswald with a
floor plan of the Book Depository at the center of the group
Jack Ruby Bull and the Indian two or three young Cubans
and a young white shooter - the man in the plaid shirt
described by Julia Ann Mercer - are also there

OSWALD
(to the two young
Cubans)
I can get you in and up there This
is a shot out the southeast window
of the sixth floor That floor will
be unoccupied between noon and one

BULL
What about the elevator

OSWALD
I can close it off The only access

is a stairwell

BULL
We get them in as an air-conditioning
unit

RUBY
No A floor refurbishing group
Got the van the uniforms

OSWALD

(his back to the screen)
if we can get the motorcade to
turn from Main onto Houston thatll
do the trick cause itll slow down
to make the turn here You cant
miss

(to the two young

Cubans)
Hes a dead duck

Ruby shares a look with Bull unbeknownst to Oswald
we see the looks on the faces of Jims team

BILL
I dont buy it chief - why would
the FBI cover it up Youre talking
the whole FBI here A telex that
disappears from every single FBI
office in the country

JIM
Theres a word - orders

Back in Garrisons office in 1968

SUSIE
Or a cover up Jesus Bill dont
you have enough proof of the FBIs
complicity now

BILL

(to Susie)
Maybe I have a little more respect
for this countrys institutions than
you do Susie You tell me how the
ell you can keep a conspiracy going
between the Mob the CIA FBI and
Army Intelligence and who knows what
else when you know you cant even
eep a secret in this room between
12 people We got leaks everywhere
Were going to trial here What the
ell do we really got Oswald Ruby
Banister Ferrie are dead Shaw -
maybe hes an agent I dont know
but as a covert operator in my book
es wide open for blackmail cause
of his homosexuality

and then
JIM
Shaws our toehold Bill I dont
know exactly what he is where he
fits and I dont care I do know
hes lying through his teeth and Im
not gonna let go of him

BILL
So for those reasons youre going
to trial against Clay Shaw chief
Well youre gonna lose We should
be investigating all our Mafia leads
here in New Orleans - Carlos Marcello
Santos Trafficante - I can buy that
a hell of a lot easier than the
Government Rubys all Mob knows
Oswald sets him up Hoffa -
Trafficante - Marcello they hire
some guns and they do Kennedy and
maybe the Government doesnt want to
open up a whole can oworms there
because it used the Mob to get to
Castro Yknow Castro being
assassinated sounds pretty wild to
John Q Citizen So they close the
book on JFK It makes sense to
me

JIM
I dont doubt their involvement
Bill but at a low level Could the
Mob change the parade route Bill
or eliminate the protection for the
President Could the Mob send Oswald
to Russia and get him back Could
e Mob get the FBI the CIA and
e Dallas Police to make a mess of
e investigation Could the Mob
ppoint the Warren Commission to
over it up Could the Mob wreck
e autopsy Could the Mob influence
e national media to go to sleep
nd since when has the Mob used
nything but 38s for hits up close
e Mob wouldnt have the guts or
e power for something of this
magnitude Assassins need payrolls
orders times schedules This was
a military-style ambush from start
to finish a coup detat with Lyndon
Johnson waiting in the wings

tHoaprtetcagvatate

BILL
Oh now youre saying Lyndon Johnson
was involved The President of the
His voice
looks and

United States

is challenging Theres a pause The men
wait

JIM
I know this Bill - Lyndon Johnson
got 1 billion for his Texas friends
Brown and Root to dredge Cam Ranh
Bay for the military in Vietnam
Thats just for openers

BILL
Boss are you calling the President
a murderer

JIM
If Im so far from the truth why is
the FBI bugging our offices Why
are our witnesses being bought off
and murdered Why are Federal
agencies blocking our extraditions
and subpoenas when we were never
blocked before

BILL
Maybe cause theres some rogue
element in the Government

The others in the room groan at the reasoning Bill
embittered cornered

JIM
With a full-blown conspiracy to cover
it up Yever read your Shakespeare
Bill

BILL

JERRY JOHNSON SHOW - The band strikes up When the Saints Go Marching In
introducing Jim who strides in from the wings to shake hands
with Jerry Johnson the friendly-looking host

SIDEKICK
And now Jerry heres Big Jim
Garrison District Attorney of New
Orleans Louisiana

The audience is enthusiastic Jim smiles and waves then
sits down next to Johnson

JOHNSON
Welcome District Attorney Garrison
May I call you Jim

JIM
Ive been called everything under
the sun Jerry Call me whatever
you like

He reads from a script on the desk

JOHNSON
First we had your charge that the
Cuban exiles killed the President
en the Mob then you said the oil
illionaires did it then you said
e Minutemen and the Ku Klux Klan
ollaborated to do it now your latest
eory seems to be that the CIA and
e FBI and the Pentagon and the
ite House all combined in some
laborate conspiracy to kill John
ennedy Let me ask you is there
nyone besides Lee Harvey Oswald who
ou think did not conspire to kill
e President

atx ONO Sttat od

He fixes his eyes on Jim waiting for a reply A weariness
has set in on Jim Once more into the slaughter

JIM
How many hours do I have to answer
that one Well lets just say this
Jerry - Ive stopped beating my wife
(the audience laughs)
Or maybe you should ask Lyndon
Johnson We know he has some answers

The audience loving it cheers Johnson looks at Jim
blankly and reads the next question on his list

JOHNSON
There have been a number of reports
in reputable news media - Time

Newsweek our own NBC - that you

have gone way beyond the legal means
available to a prosecutor that youve
intimidated and drugged witnesses
bribed them urged them to commit
perjury What is your response

JIM
Your faith in the veracity of the
major media is touching Jerry It
indicates that the Age of Innocence
is not yet over But seriously
Jerry people arent interested in
Jim Garrison - they want the hard
evidence They want to know why he
was killed and what forces were
opposed to
JOHNSON
(interrupting)
Some people would say youre paranoid

JIM
Well if I am why is the Government
concealing evidence

JOHNSON
Are they Why would they

JIM
(pulling out his
briefcase)
Thats exactly my question Jerry
Maybe Id better show you some
pictures so you can begin to
understand what I am talking about

He pulls out a large blowup of the Allen photo of the three
hoboes and starts to hold it up in front of the camera

JIM
These arrests were photographed
minutes after the assassination and
were never shown to the American
public They show

It takes Johnson a few moments to realize whats happening
When he does he lunges like a cobra for the photographs
pulling Jims arm down so the pictures are out of the cameras
view

JOHNSON
(sharply)
Pictures like this dont show up on
television

JIM
(holding the picture
up again)
Sure they do The camera can pick
this up

JOHNSON
(yanking his arm down)
No it cant

Jim swings the picture up a third time but the stage director
gives a cut signal - finger across the throat - and the

red light on the camera blinks off The monitor shows another
camera panning the audience

JIM
(quickly realizes
hes about to be cut
off)
Those men you just saw were arrested
in Dallas minutes after the
assassination They were never seen
again No record of arrest no
fingerprint no mugshot nothing
They all got away

The director frantically gives Johnson the cut sign

JOHNSON
Well be back after these messages

The audience cheers as the commercial comes on
GARRISONS HOME - Jim comes home His wife and two of the children are waiting
in the doorway They kiss Al Oser interrupts

AL
Jim bad news Bills turned boss
I think hes given everything weve
got to the Feds

NUMA
We studied the memos - there was
nothing there chief nothing When
we went to confront him the landlady
said that sonofabitch just took off
left everything

SUSIE
Im sorry

JIM
I know

LIZ

(to Jim)

Im sorry

NUMA

Something sure scared him

JIM
Bill doesnt scare that easy
Somebody got to his thinking He
was never that good a thinker

On the TV the news is on

NEWSMAN 9
Much is at stake tonight in
California Public opinion polls
show Senator Robert Kennedy of New
York leading Senator Eugene McCarthy
of Minnesota Their anti-Vietnam
War message is obviously striking a
chord with the voters and whoever
wins tonight will certainly emerge
as the favorite over Vice-President
Humphrey to win the nomination in
Chicago in August That man now
seems to be Senator Kennedy

We see a shot of Robert Kennedy in Los Angeles with his
supporters

NUMA
Sure sounds like hes winning

JIM
Hell never make it If he wins
theyll kill him He wants to avenge
his brother Hell stop that war
No theyll kill him before they let
him become President

Liz shares a look with Al and Numa

AL

Boss with Broussard they have
everything All our witnesses our
strategy for the trial Wed have
to doublecheck all his work there
could be false leads we gotta
rethink this trial

We dont have a choice

JIM
I dont think so Al You remember
the Hemingway story The Old Man
and the Sea

(Al nods)
The old fisherman manages to catch
this great fish - a fish so huge he
has to tie it to the side of the
boat to get it back in But by the
time he reached shore the fish had
long since been picked apart by sharks
and nothing was left but the skeleton

NUMA
Then what are we going through all
this trouble for

JIM
Its a means to an end This war
has two fronts - in the court of
law we hope against the odds to
nail Clay Shaw on a conspiracy charge
In the court of public opinion it
could take another 25 or 30 years

for the truth to come out but at
least were going to strike the first
blow

LIZ
And if youre wrong

JIM
(rising)
I never doubted for a second that I
was
(softly)

Will you come to the trial Elizabeth

LIZ
I dont think so Jim

She walks out

We see the outside of Jims house and hear crickets chirping -
the purr of the suburb Inside the TV election results are
still on

NEWSMAN 1
With 53 of the precincts reporting
Senator Kennedy continues to hold a
lead of 48 to 41 over Senator
McCarthy CBS News has projected
Senator Robert Kennedy the winner of
the crucial California primary

Jim is in the kitchen fixing himself a sandwich Theres a
strange feeling in the house We hear the wind - a shutter
sighing Jim suddenly doesnt feel alone in the kitchen

ROBERT KENNEDY
(voice over on TV)

and that is what has been going
on within the United States over the
last three years - the division the
violence the disenchantment whether
its between blacks and whites
between poor and the more affluent
or between age groups or the war in
Vietnam - we can start to work
together We are a great country
an unselfish country anda
compassionate country I intend to
make that my basis for running

He waves and leaves the podium going back through the kitchen
of the hotel Jim is frozen in his spot shaken The ghost
of Jack Kennedy - as he was before the killing - stares at
him through the kitchen as if encased in a hologram The
hooded eyes watch Jim without expression Theyre
communicating in some strange subliminal way Suddenly
shots ring out from the television and theres pandemonium

NEWSMAN 1
(shaken)
SENATOR KENNEDY HAS BEEN SHOT WE
DO NOT KNOW HOW SERIOUS IT IS YET
SENATOR KENNEDY HAS BEEN SHOT

The television shows a scene of confusion Jim walks out
looking at the TV struck down with his foreknowledge and
his inability to do anything about it

In their bedroom upstairs that night Jim gently wakes Liz
and holds her

JIM
They killed him honey

LIZ
(groggily)
Huh
JIM
(strangled)
He won and they killed Robert

Kennedy They shot him down

LIZ
(realizing with terror)
Oh no No I cant believe it I
cant believe it Both of them
both brothers oh my God

She clings to him horrified He caresses her hair They
look in each others eyes

LIZ
Youre right it hasnt ended has
it

He kisses her gently - They start to make love numbed
needing each other needing their love in an increasingly
terrifying world

JIM
(awkward)
I wish I couldve loved you more
I feel sometimes like I didnt ever
love you or the children enough
Im sorry

OUTSIDE THE COURTS BUILDING - NEW ORLEANS -(JAN 1969)
The scene is like a circus Armed uniformed guards with
walkie-talkies are everywhere Guards with rifles are on
the rooftop There are crowds of reporters from around the
world and many onlookers Everyone going into the courtroom
is frisked by electronic metal detectors

INSIDE THE COURTROOM

Jim accompanied by Mattie the maid but not his wife forges
his way through a tightly packed crowd to the prosecution
table joining Al Susie Numa and others from his team
Young law student have come to watch The crowd is noisy to
the point of unruliness Suddenly theres a hush as everyone
cranes their necks to see Clay Shaw and his attorneys Irvin
Dymond and two others enter the court Shaw impeccably
dressed his high handsome cheekbones sucking on an ever-
present cigarette in a porcelain filter (smoking in court

was allowed then) smiles to those who greet him as if they
were not really there and limps past Jim with a stony
indifference

The clerk starts pounding the gavel to call the court to
order as Judge Edward Aloysius Haggerty sweeps in and takes
the bench Hes a stocky little Jimmy Cagney look alike
with fierce blue eyes under bushy brows The jurors - nine
white men and three black men - all dressed in suits and
ties look on

CUT TO Willie OKeefe pointing out Clay Shaw
OKEEFE
Thats Clay Bertrand Thats the

man I saw at David Ferries

Irvin Dymond cross-examines OKeefe

DYMOND
(words wafting)
Thats who you say you saw a
confessed homosexual convicted of
solicitation pandering a man who

has lied about most everything who

TIME CUT TO Vernon Bundy a poor black man who points at
Shaw

BUNDY
It was that man there yessir He
was at the Pontchartrain wall with
the man who shot the President I
remember him cause o his limp there

DYMOND
A heroin addict injecting himself
at the wall barely conscious
TIME CUT TO Jim looking over at a strange man Matthews a
kind of lawyer making notes and conferring with Shaw and
Dymond Matthews seems to have some authority over both
men

Corrie Collins a black woman who is one of the CORE workers
from Clinton is on the stand

COLLINS
(pointing at Shaw)

that was the man there He dropped
Oswald off on the voter line I
remember cause they were the only
white strangers around that morning
That big black Cadillac of his made
me think they might be FBI

TIME CUT TO the Town Marshall on the stand

TOWN MARSHALL
(looking at Shaw)
said he was a representative of
one International Trade Mart in New
Orleans

DYMOND
--more than five years ago for two
minutes Its fair to say you could
be mistaken isnt it

TIME CUT TO Dymond cross-examining Dean Andrews shaking his
head

ANDREWS
figment of my imagination The
cats stewing me the oysters
shucking me I told him you got the
right at-at but the wrong oh-oh
Bertrand is not Shaw scouts honor
and you can tell him I said so

SUSIE
(counter-arguing)
Objection your Honor This office
has won a conviction of perjury
against Dean Andrews on this matter

DYMOND
Exception taken That case is on
appeal

Arguments follow

TIME CUT TO Charles Goldberg a mild-looking New York
accountant on the stand with Dymond cross-examing
DYMOND

(relishing this)
Mr Goldberg you claim you met David
Ferrie and Clay Shaw while ona
vacation here from your accounting
business in New York you had drinks
and under the influence discussed
killing Kennedy is that not so

GOLDBERG
I did

DYMOND
Why

GOLDBERG

Well I wanted to make sure shes
the same girl I sent

DYMOND
I see and why are you experiencing
this paranoia

GOLDBERG
(launching into his
explanation)
Well you see Ive been subject to
hypnosis and psychological warfare
ever since 1948 when I was in
Korea

We see the faces of people in the courtroom
face obviously Goldberg is disturbed (or maybe he is
telling the truth but it doesnt play well)

Al sickly

AL
He was one of Broussards witnesses
chief Im sorry He was totally
sane when we took his affidavit

SUSIE
But how does Dymond know what to
ask FUCK Were dead

GOLDBERG
When someone tries to get your
attention - catch your eye - thats
a clue right off

the judges

Jim looks at

TIME CUT TO Jim calling Officer Habighorst to testify

GARRISON
Your Honor I call police officer
Aloysisus Habighorst to the stand
Habighorst the clean-cut police officer who booked Clay
Shaw on the day of his arrest starts forward

JUDGE HAGGERTY
Im going to have to ask the jury to
leave the courtroom

GARRISON
What

This is an ugly surprise for Jim We see him at the bench
arguing loudly with the judge Susie Dymond and Al are
also there

JUDGE HAGGERTY
Im sorry Jim but the defendant
did not have his lawyer present when
asked

FLASHBACK TO 1967 in the New Orleans police station Shaw
is being booked The press is there and Habighorst is
questioning him

HABIGHORST
Any alias

SHAW
Clay Bertrand

We see a close-up on Habighorst typing this in

GARRISON (V0)
Jesus Ed from time immemorial its
been standard booking procedure to
ask an alias You know that Theres
no constitutional requirement that
says a lawyer has to be present for
routine questions

JUDGE HAGGERTY
I callem as I seeem Jim Im
ruling it inadmissible

GARRISON
Thats our case

JUDGE HAGGERTY
If thats your case you didnt have
a case I wouldnt believe whatever
Habighorst said anyway

GARRISON
I cant believe youre saying this

in the courtroom

JUDGE HAGGERTY
(feistier)
Well I am saying it Bring in the
jury

AL
Were filing for a writ to the
appellate court

JUDGE HAGGERTY
You do that

Dymond goes back to Shaw very please Shaw smokes icy
Jim devastated sits feeling its over

CUT TO Clay Shaw on the stand Dymond cross-examines him

DYMOND
-Oswald

SHAW
No I did not

DYMOND
ever called Dean Andrews

SHAW
No I did not

DYMOND
and have you ever met David Ferrie

SHAW
(with a smirk of
amusement)
No I would not even know what he
looked like except for the pictures
Ive been shown

DYMOND
did you ever use the alias Clay
Bertrand

SHAW

No I did not

DYMOND
Thank you Mr Shaw

Jim rises slowly out of his chair

JIM
Well a very great actor has just
given us a great performance Your
Honor but we are nowhere closer to
the truth Let it be noted my office
is charging Clay Shaw with outright
perjury on the fifteen answers he
has given not one word of this

JUDGE HAGGERTY
Youre out of order Jim Boy now
sit down Strike those remarks

CUT TO later in the trial A movie screen has been installed
for the jury Jim paces dramatically as if waiting casting
looks at the door Members of the press pack the hot room
and a fan turns overhead

JIM
To prove their was a conspiracy
involving Clay Shaw we must prove
there was more than one man involved
in the assassination To do that
we must look at the Zapruder film
which my office has subpoenaed The
American public has not seen that
film because it has been kept locked
in a vault in the Time-Life Building
in New York City for the last five
years There is a reason for that
Watch

The Zapruder film (8mm) now rolls We have seen pieces of

it before in the opening of the film but now we see it whole
It is crucial that this piece of film be repeated several
times during the trial to drive home a point that is easily
lost on casual viewing The first viewing is silent except
for the sound of the clanky projector It lasts about 25
seconds and then the lights come on The jury is shaken

The judge is shaken The people in the courtroom murmur

Even Clay Shaw is surprised at what he has seen Jim says
nothing letting the truth of it sink in Then

JIM
A picture speaks a thousand words
Yet sometimes the truth is too simple
for some The Warren Commission
thought they had an open and shut
case three bullets one assassin -
but two things happened that made it
virtually impossible 1)the Zapruder
film which you just saw and 2)the
third wounded man Jim Tague who
was nicked by a fragment down by the
Triple Underpass The time frame of
56 seconds established by the
Zapruder film left no possibility of
a fourth shot from Oswalds rifle
but the shot or fragment that left a
superficial wound on Tagues cheek
had to come from a bullet that missed
the car entirely Now they had two

bullets that hit and we know one of
them was the fatal head shot Soa
single bullet remained to account
for all seven wounds in Kennedy and
Connally But rather than admit to
a conspiracy or investigate further
the Commission chose to endorse the
theory put forth by an ambitious
junior counsellor Arlen Specter
One of the grossest lies ever forced
on the American people weve come
to know it as the magic bullet
theory

CUT TO a drawing which has been put on a chair for the Jury
Jim has also moved Al acting as JFK into a chair directly
behind the larger Numa acting as Governor Connally He
demonstrates with a pointer

JIM

The magic bullet enters the
Presidents back headed downward at
an angle of 17 degrees It then
moves upward in order to leave
Kennedys body from the front of his
neck - his neck wound number two -
where it waits 16 seconds turns
right and continues into Connallys
body at the rear of his right armpit -
wound number three Then the bullet
heads downward at an angle of 27
degrees shattering Connallys fifth
rib and leaving from the right side
of his chest - wounds four and five
The bullet continues downward and
then enters Connallys right wrist -
wound number six - shattering the
radius bone It then enters his
left thigh - wound number seven -
from which it later falls out and is
found in almost pristine condition
on a stretcher in a corridor of
Parkland Hospital

(he shows a mock-up

of the pristine

bullet)
Thats some bullet Anyone whos
been in combat can tell you never in
the history of gunfire has there
been a bullet like this

(the court laughs)
The Army Wound Ballistics experts at
Edgewood Arsenal fired some comparison
bullets and not one of them looked
anything like this one

(he shows mock-ups of
Jim walks
On it are
points to
courtroom
she takes

comparison bullets)
Take a look at CE 856 an identical
bullet fired through the wrist of a
human cadaver - just one of the bones
smashed by the magic bullet Yet
the government says it can prove
this with some fancy physics ina
nuclear laboratory Of course they
can Theoretical physics can prove
an elephant can hang from a cliff
with its tail tied to a daisy but
use your eyes - your common sense -
(he holds the bullet)
Seven wounds skin bone This single
bullet explanation is the foundation
of the Warren Commissions claim of
a lone assassin And once you
conclude the magic bullet could not
create all seven of those wounds
you have to conclude there was a
fourth shot and a second rifleman
And if there was a second rifleman
there had to be a conspiracy which
we believe involved the accused Clay
Shaw Fifty-one witnesses gentlemen
of the jury thought they heard shots
coming from the Grassy Knoll which
is to the right and front of the
President

to a drawing of an overhead view of Dealey Plaza
dots representing locations of the witnesses He
each portion He pauses and looks out into the
- Liz has entered accompanied by Jasper Quietly
a seat Jim is unbelieving at first then very

moved He takes a beat then

JIM
Key witnesses that day - Charles
Brehm a combat vet right behind
Jean Hill and Mary Moorman SM
Holland and Richard Dodd on the
overpass JC Price overlooking the
whole Plaza Randolph Carr a
steelworker who served in the Rangers
in North Africa William Newman
father of two children who hit the
deck on the north side of Elm Abraham
Zapruder James Simmons - each of
these witnesses has no doubt
whatsoever one or more shots came
from behind the picket fence Twenty
six trained medical personnel at
Parkland Hospital saw with their own
eyes the back of the Presidents
head blasted out
CUT TO Dr Peters on the stand

PETERS
(describing the wound)

a large 7 cm opening in the right
occipitoparietal area a considerable
portion of the brain was missing
there

(he gestures to his
head)

CUT TO Dr McClelland on the stand

MCCLELLAND
almost a fifth or perhaps a quarter

of the back of the head - this area
here

(he indicates his

head)
had been blasted out along with
the brain tissue there The exit
hole in the rear of his head was
about 120 mm across There was
also a large piece of skull attached
to a flap of skin in the right
temporal area

FLASHBACK TO Parkland Hospital Emergency Room on that day
in 1963 The doctors work on the President The wounds on
the back of his head are evident but will change later in
the autopsy He is placed in a bronze casket

JIM (VO)
Not one of the civilian doctors who
examined the President at Parkland
Hospital regarded his throat wound
as anything but a wound of entry
The doctors found no wounds of entry
in the back of the head But the
body was then illegally moved to
Washington for the autopsy

CUT TO the Secret Service team preparing to wheel the casket
out The Dallas Medical Examiner Dr Rose backed by a
justice of the peace bars the way A furious wrestling
match ensues

MEDICAL EXAMINER
Texas Law sir requires the autopsy
be done here Youre not taking him
with you

KENNY ODONNELL
Sonofabitch youre not telling me
what to do Get the hell outta the
way

The Secret Service agents put the doctor and judge up against
the wall at gunpoint and sweep out of the hospital

JIM (VO)
Because when a coup detat has
occurred theres a big difference
between an autopsy performed by
civilian doctors and one by military
doctors working for the government

FLASHBACK TO Love Field the same day We see Air Force One
taking off and a photo of LBJ being sworn in

JIM (VO)
The departure of Air Force One from
Love Field that Friday afternoon was
not so much a takeoff as it was a
getaway with the newly sworn in
President

DYMOND (VO)
Objection your honor

JUDGE
Sustained

JIM (VO)
On the plane of course Lee Harvey
Oswalds guilt was announced by the
White House Situation Room to the
passengers before any kind of
investigation had started The lone
nut solution is in place

DYMOND (VO)
Objection Your Honor

JUDGE
Sustained Mr Garrison would you
please bottle the acid

FLASHBACK TO the Bethesda autopsy room in 1963 The room
is crammed with military officers Secret Service men and

at the center three intimidated doctors Pictures are being
taken as they remove bullet fragments

JIM
The three Bethesda Naval Hospital
doctors picked by the Military left
something to be desired inasmuch as
none of them had experience with
combat gunfire wounds Through their
autopsy we have been able to justify
eight wounds - three to Kennedy
five to Connally - from just two
bullets one of these bullets the
magic bullet

CUT TO Jim in court with a series of drawings indicating
with arrows entry and exit wounds to Kennedys neck and head

Dr Finck

FLASHBACK

is on the stand erect very precise

JIM
Colonel Finck are you saying someone
told you not to dissect the neck

FINCK
I was told that the family wanted
examination of the head

JIM
As a pathologist it was your
obligation to explore all possible
causes of death was it not

FINCK
I had the cause of death

JIM
Your Honor I would ask you to direct
the witness to answer my question
Why did Colonel Finck not dissect
the track of the bullet wound in the
neck

FINCK
Well I heard Dr Humes stating that -
he said

TO Bethesda autopsy room

HUMES
Whos in charge here

ARMY GENERAL
I am

FINCK (VO)

I dont remember his name You must
understand it was quite crowded and
when you are called in circumstances
like that to look at the wound of
the President who is dead you dont
look around too much to ask people
for their names and who they are

JIM (VO)
But you were a qualified pathologist
Was this Army general a qualified
pathologist

and irritated
FINCK (V0O)
No

JIM (VO)
But you took his orders He was
directing the autopsy

FINCK (VO)
No because there were others There
were admirals

JIM (VO)
There were admirals

FINCK (VO)
Oh yes there were admirals - and
when you are a lieutenant colonel in
the Army you just follow orders and
at the end of the autopsy we were
specifically told - as I recall it
was Admiral Kenney the Surgeon
General of the Navy - we were
specifically told not to discuss the
case

KENNEY
(in Bethesda scene)
Gentlemen what youve seen in this
room is intensely private to the
Kennedy family and it is not our
business to

Jim turns away from the jury His point is made Finck is
no longer on the stand

JIM
In addition to which 1) the chief
pathologist Commander Humes by his
own admission voluntarily burned his
autopsy notes 2)never released the
autopsy photos to the public 3)
President Johnson ordered the blood
soaked limousine filled with bullet
holes and clues to be immediately
washed and rebuilt 4) sent John
Connallys bloody suit right to the
cleaners and 5) when my office
finally got a court order to examine
President Kennedys brain in the
National Archives in the hopes of
finding from what direction the
bullets came we were told by the
government the Presidents brain had
disappeared
Theres a pause and then a murmur from the court Jim is
on a roll and knows it The faces in the courtroom are with
him absorbed horrified The law students are still there
they have been since day one But it is Lizs interest that
touches him the most

JIM
So what really happened that day
Lets just for a moment speculate
shall we We have the epileptic
seizure around 1215 PM
distracting the police making it
easier for the shooters to move into
their places The epileptic later
vanished never checking into the
hospital The A Team gets on the
6th floor of the Book Depository

FLASHBACK TO the Book Depository 1963 A shooter and two
spotters dressed as working men move into the Oswald spot
One spotter produces the Mannlicher-Carcano

JIM (VO)
They were refurbishing the floors in
the Depository that week which
allowed unknown workmen in and out
of the building The men move quickly
into position just minutes before
the shooting

The camera takes the shooters point of view we see down

the street through a scope His spotter wears a radio
earpiece The second spotter is working out of the southeast
window

JIM (VO)
The second spotter is probably calling
all the shots on a radio to the two
other teams He as the best overall
view - the God spot

Inside the Dal-Tex Building a shooter and a spotter dressed
as air-conditioning men move into a small second-story textile
storage room

JIM (VO)
B Team - one rifleman and one spotter
with a headset with access to the
building - moves into a low floor of
the Dal-Tex Building

At the picket fence a shooter in a Dallas Police uniform
moves into place aiming up Elm Street His spotter has a
radio to his ear Another man in a Secret Service suit moves
further down the fence
JIM (VO)

The third team the C Team moves in
behind the picket fence above the
Grassy Knoll where the shooter and
the spotter are first seen by the
late Lee Bowers in the watchtower of
the railyard They have the best
position of all Kennedy is close
and on a flat low trajectory

Part of this team is a coordinator whos flashed security
credentials at several people chasing them out of the parking
lot area

An agent in tie and suit moves on the underpass keeping
an eye out

In the crowd on Elm Street we catch brief glimpses of the
umbrella man and the Cuban neither of them watching Kennedy
both looking around to their teams There is a third man
heavyset in a construction helmet

JIM (VO)
Probably two to three more men are
down in the crowd on Elm ten to
twelve men three teams three

shooters The triangulation of fire
Clay Shaw and David Ferrie discussed
two months before Theyve walked
the Plaza they know every inch
Theyve calibrated their sights
practiced on moving targets Theyre
ready Its going to be a turkey
shoot Kennedys motorcade makes

the turn from Main onto Houston

JFK waves and turns in slow motion

JIM (VO)
Six witnesses see two gunmen on the
sixth floor of the Depository moving
around Some of them think theyre
policemen with rifles

From Houston Street we look up at the sixth floor of the
Book Depository and see the shooter moving around Arnold
Rowland points him out to his wife

ARNOLD
(under)
probably a security agent

In the Dallas County Jail Johnny Powell is one of many
convicts housed on the sixth floor - the same height as the
men in the Book Depository We look across to the Depository
through cell bars Johnny and various cell mates are watching
two men in the sixth floor of the Depository

JIM (VO)
John Powell a prisoner on the sixth
floor of the Dallas County Jail
sees them

POWELL
(under)

-quite a few of us saw them
Everybody was hollering and yelling
and that We thought is was security
guys

JIM (VO)

they dont shoot him coming up
Houston which is the easiest shot
for a single shooter in the Book
Depository but they wait till he
gets to the killing zone between
three rifles Kennedy makes the
final turn from Houston onto Elm
slowing down to some 11 miles per
hour

All the shooters tighten taking aim Its a tense moment
JIM (VO)

The shooters across Dealey Plaza
tighten taking their aim across

their sights waiting for the
radio to say Green Green or Abort
Abort

The camera is on Kennedy waving A MONTAGE follows - all
the faces in the square that weve introduced in the movie
now appear one after the other watching - the killers the
man with the umbrella the Newman family Mary Moorman
photographing Jean Hill Abraham Zapruder filming it SM
Holland Patrolman Harkness INTERCUT with the Zapruder
and Nix films on JFK in the final seconds coming abreast
of the Stemmons Freeway sign

JIM (VO)
The first shot rings out

CUT TO the Dal-Tex shooter firing We see the back of
Kennedys through his gun sight Kennedy (stand in) reacts
in the Zapruder film

JIM (VO)
Sounding like a backfire it misses
completely Frame 161 Kennedy

stops waving as he hears something
Connally turns his head slightly to
the right
Everything goes off very fast now Repeating intercuts are
slowed down with shots of Kennedy reacting in the Zapruder
film

JIM (VO)
Frame 193 - the second shot hits
Kennedy in the throat from the front
Frame 225 - the President emerging
from the road sign He obviously
has been hit raising his arms to
his throat

CUT TO the picket fence shooter hitting him from the fence
We see Kennedy (stand in) from the point of view of his
telescopic sight In the Zapruder film we see Kennedy clutch
his throat

JIM
Frame 232 the third shot - the
President has been hit in the back
drawing him downward and forward
Connally you will notice shows no
signs at all of being hit He is
visibly holding his Stetson which is
impossible if his wrist has been
shattered

CUT TO the Dal-Tex shooter We see Kennedy from his point
of view and the Zapruder film in slow motion

JIM (VO)
Connallys turning now here Frame
238 the fourth shot misses Kennedy

and takes Connally in the back

This is the key shot that proves two
rifles from the rear This is 16
seconds after the third shot and we
know no manual bolt action rifle can
be recycled in that time Connally
is hit his mouth drops he yells
out My God theyre going to kill
us all Here

CUT TO the sixth floor shooter firing rapidly and missing
Kennedy but hitting Connally (stand in)

JIM (VO)

the umbrella man is signalling
Hes not dead Keep shooting
James Tague down at the underpass is
hit sometime now by another shot
that misses

CUT TO the umbrella man pumping his umbrella The Cuban is
looking off The man on the curb in the construction helmet
is looking not at JFK but up at the Book Depository

JIM (VO)
The car brakes The fifth and fatal
shot - frame 313 - takes Kennedy in
the head from the front

CUT TO the picket fence shooter We see JFK from his
point of view He fires and then we see Kennedy in the
Zapruder film flying backwards and to his left in a ferocious
conclusive spray of blood and brain tissue We repeat the
shot

JIM (VO)
This is the key shot Watch it again
The President going back to his left
Shot from the front and right
Totally inconsistent with the shot
from the Depository Again -
(repeats) back and two the left
(he repeats it like a mantra)
back and to the left back and to
the left

Kennedys car speeds off Jackie is like a crawling animal
in a pillbox hat on the back of the car The people on the
other side of the underpass wave innocently as the car speeds
through with its horrifying contents Pigeons fly off the
rooftop of the Book Depository

JIM (VO)

at happens then Pandemonium

e shooters quickly disassemble

eir various weapons all except
e Oswald rifle

ttHeSe

CUT TO sixth floor spotter dumping the Mannlicher - Carcano
in a corner as he leaves and then to the Dal-Tex spotter
and shooter who break down the gun and move out and then
to the spotter with the fence shooter who quickly breaks
down the weapon throwing it in the trunk of a car parked at
the fence He walks away The fence shooter dressed as a
policeman blends with the crowd

CUT TO the umbrella man and the Cuban sitting quietly
together on the north side of the curb of Elm Street

CUT TO stunned confused people in the crowd - some lying
on the ground some running for the Grassy Knoll

Back in the courtroom patrolman Joe Smith is on the stand

JIM (VO)
Patrolman Joe Smith rushed into the
parking lot behind the fence He
smelled gunpowder
FLASHBACK TO the picket fence area where with his gun drawn
Smith rushes across to a man standing by a car who reacts
quickly producing credentials He is one of the hoboes
Theres a strange moment when the camera moves from Smiths
eyes to the mans fingernails

SMITH (VO)

the character produces credentials
from his pocket which showed him to
be Secret Service So I accepted
that and let him go and continued
our search But I regretted it
cause this guy looked like an auto
mechanic He had on a sports shirt
and pants but he had dirty
fingernails Afterwards it didnt
ring true but at the time we were
so pressed for time

JIM (VO)
Yet all Secret Servicemen in Dallas
that day are accounted for None
were on foot in Dealey Plaza before
or after the shooting till Dallas
Secret Service Chief Forrest Sorrels
returned at 1255

Back in the courtroom Liz is totally absorbed Jim exchanges
looks with her The camera movies in for a close - up of
Jim

JIM
(pausing for effect)
What else was going on in Dealey
Plaza that day At least 12 other
individuals were taken into custody
by Dallas police No records of
their arrests Men acting like hoboes
were being pulled off trains marched
through Dealey Plaza photographed
and yet there is no records of their
arrests

FLASHBACK TO the three hoboes being arrested marching
across Dealey Plaza The hoboes look familiar now

JIM (VO)
Men identifying themselves as Secret
Service Agents were all over the
place But who was impersonating
them

FLASHBACK TO men in suits ties and hats moving people out
of the parking lot area turning a policeman back
FLASHBACK TO the Cuban putting away a radio and the
umbrella man who now rise and leave the area in opposite
directions

JIM (VO)
And where was Lee Oswald Probably
in the second floor snack room
Eddie Piper and William Shelly saw
Oswald eating lunch in the first
floor lunch room around twelve
Around 1215 on her way out of the
building to see the motorcade
secretary Carolyn Arnold saw Oswald
in the second floor snack room where
he said he went for a Coke

In the second floor lunchroom of the Book Depository we see
Carolyn Arnold a pregnant secretary crossing past Oswald
who is in a booth

CAROLYN ARNOLD (VO)
He was sitting in one of the booths
on the right hand side of the room
He was alone as usual and appeared
to be having lunch I did not speak
to him but I recognized clearly I
remember it was 1215 or later It
coulda been 1225 five minutes before
the assassination I dont exactly
remember I was pregnant and I had
a craving for a glass of water

On the sixth floor of the depository Bonnie Ray Williams is
eating a chicken lunch alone

JIM
(vo)
At the same time Bonnie Ray Williams
is supposedly eating his chicken
lunch on the sixth floor at least
until 1215 maybe 1220 he sees
nobody

On the street Arnold Rowland and his wife look up at the
sixth floor windows and we see from their point of view
two shadowy figures

JIM (VO)
Down on the street Arnold Rowland
was seeing two men in the sixth floor

windows presumably after Bonnie
Ray Williams finished his lunch and
left

We see footage of JFK coming up Houston - waving
Oswald walks into the second floor lunchroom as policeman
Marrion Baker runs in gun at his side He is about 30 feet
from Oswald Roy Truly the superintendent runs in a moment
later

JIM (VO)
Kennedy was running five minutes
late for his appointment with death
He was due at 1225 If Oswald was
the assassin he was certainly pretty
non-chalant about getting himself
into position Later he told Dallas
police he was standing in the second
floor snackroom Probably told to
wait there for a phone call by his
handler The phones were in the
adjacent and empty second floor
offices but the call never came A
maximum 90 seconds after Kennedy is
shot patrolman Marrion Baker runs
into Oswald in that second story
lunchroom

BAKER
Hey you
(to Truly)
Do you know this man Is he an
employee

TRULY
Yes he is
(as Baker moves on)
The Presidents been shot

Oswald reacts as if hearing it for the first time Truly
and Baker continue running up the stairs Oswald proceeds
to get a Coke and continues out of the room

CUT TO the sixth floor where we see Oswald as the shooter
After firing he runs full speed for the stairs stashing

the rifle on the other side of the loft Our camera follows
him roughly down stairs - we hear the loud sound of his shoes
banging on the hollow wood - to the lunchroom where Patrolman
Baker and Superintendent Truly run in Then they start to
repeat the same action as seen in the previous scene

JIM (VO)
-but what the Warren Report would
have us believe is that after firing
3 bolt action shots in 56 seconds
Oswald then leaves three cartridges
neatly side by side in the firing
nest wipes the rifle clear of
fingerprints stashes the rifle on
the other side of the loft sprints
down five flights of stairs past
witnesses Victoria Adams and Sandra
Styles who never see him and then
shows up cool and calm on the second
floor in front of Patrolman Baker -
all this within a maximum 90 seconds
of the shooting Is he out of breath
According to Baker absolutely not

CUT TO the second floor Oswald ambles past Mrs Reid a
secretary in the second floor office on his way out Coke
bottle in hand and wearing his usual dreamy look theres
a lingering close - up on his face

JIM (VO)
Assuming he is the sole assassin
Oswald is now free to escape from
the building The longer he delays
the more chance the building will be
sealed by the police Is he guilty
Does he walk out the nearest
staircase No he buys a Coke and
at a slow pace spotted by Mrs Reid
in the second floor office he strolls
out the more distant front exit
where the cops start to gather

Outside we see Oswald stroll out the door of the Book
Depository into the crowd He heads for the bus stop to the
east

JIM (VO)
Oddly considering three shots are
supposed to have come from there
nobody seals the Depository for ten
more minutes Oswald slips out as
do several other employees Of
course when he realized something
had gone wrong and the President
really had been shot he knew there
was a problem He may even have
known he was the patsy An intuition
maybe - the President killed in spite
of his warning The phone call that
never came Perhaps fear now came
to Lee Oswald He wasnt going to
stand around for roll call

Back in the courtroom Jim continues speaking

JIM
The story gets pretty confusing now -
more twists in it than a watersnake
Richard Carr says he saw four men
take off from the Book Depository in
a Rambler that possibly belongs to
Janet Williams Deputy Roger Craig
says two men picked up Oswald in the
same Rambler a few minutes later
Other people say Oswald took a bus
out of there and then because he
was stuck in traffic he hopped a
cab to his rooming house in Oak
Cliff

FLASHBACK TO Oswalds boarding house Oswald enters his
room passing Earlene Roberts the heavyset white housekeeper

JIM (VO)
we must assume he wanted to get
back in touch with his intell team
probably at a safehouse or at the
Texas Theatre but how could he be
sure He didnt know who to trust
anymore

ROBERTS
(watching TV)
My God did you see that Mr Lee
A man shot the President

The camera closes in on Oswalds perplexed face Earlene
peeks out the shades as she hears two short honks on a horn

Outside is a black police car driven by Tippit Also in the
car is the fence shooter dressed as a Dallas policeman

The car drives by honks twice waits then moves away
During this visual we see the fence shooter changing his
uniform into civilian clothes

JIM (VO)

Oswald returns to this rooming house
around PM half hour after the
assassination puts on his jacket
grabs his 38 revolver leaves at
104 Earlene Roberts the
housekeeper says she heard two beeps
on a car horn and two uniformed cops
pulled up to the house while Oswald
was in his room like it was a signal
or something Officer Tippit is
shot between 110 and 115 about a
mile away Though no one actually
saw him walking or jogging the
Government says Oswald covered that
distance Incidentally that walk
if he did it is in a straight line
toward Jack Rubys house Giving
the government the benefit of the
doubt Oswald would have had to jog
a mile in six to eleven minutes and
commit the murder then reverse
direction and walk 35 of a mile to

the Texas Theatre and arrive sometime
before 130 Thats some walking

On a street Oswald walks alone fast A police car pulls
up alongside him on 10th Street Oswald leans on the
passenger side of the window Officer Tippit suspicious
gets out to question him Oswald pulls his 38 revolver and
shoots him down in the street with 5 shots

JIM (VO)
Its also a useful conclusion After
all why else would Oswald kill
Officer Tippit unless he just shot
the President and feared arrest
Not one credible witness could
identify Oswald as Tippits killer

Domingo Benavides hidden in his truck only a few yards away
watches as another unidentified man (not seen before) shoots
and walks away

JIM (VO)
Domingo Benavides the closest witness
to the shooting refused to identify
Oswald as the killer and was never
taken to a lineup

We see Acquilla Clemons a black woman looking on She
watches as two men kill Tippit One of them resembles the
fence shooter The other one is a mystery figure seen before
in the fringes The men walk off quickly in opposite
directions We notice a policemans uniform hanging in the
back seat of Tippits car

JIM (VO)
Acquilla Clemons saw the killer with
another man and says they went off
in separate directions Mrs Clemons
was never taken to lineup or to the
Warren Commission Mr Frank Wright
who saw the killer run away stated
flatly that the killer was not Lee
Oswald Oswald is found with a 38
revolver Tippit is killed with a
-38 automatic At the scene of the
crime Officer JM Poe marks the
shells with his initials to record
the chain of evidence

CUT TO Policeman Poe marking the bullets

JIM (VO)
Those initials are not on the three
cartridge cases which the Warren
Commission presents to him
On a Dallas avenue near the Texas Theatre Oswald moves along
spooked Police cars roar by with sirens blaring Johnny
Brewer in a shoestore spots him and follows him

JIM (VO)
Oswald is next seen by shoe salesman
Johnny Brewer lurking along Jefferson
Avenue Oswald is scared He begins
to realize the full implications of
this thing He goes into the Texas
Theatre possibly his prearranged
meeting point but though he has 14
in his pocket he does not buy the
75-cent ticket Brewer has the
cashier call the police

Outside the Texas Theatre Oswald walks past the cashier who
is out on the sidewalk watching the police cars go by A
double feature is playing - Cry of Battle with Van Heflin
and War is Hell He goes in

CUT TO 30 officers arriving at the theatre in a fleet of
patrol cars

JIM (VO)
In response to the cashiers call
at least thirty officers in a fleet
of patrol cars descend on the movie
theatre This has to be the most
remarkable example of police intuition
since the Reichstag fire I dont
buy it They knew - someone knew -
Oswald was going to be there In
fact as early as 1244 only 14
minutes after the assassination the
police radio put out a description
matching Oswalds size and build
Brewer says the man was wearing a
jacket but the police say the man
who shot Tippit left his jacket
behind Butch Burroughs theatre
manager says Oswald bought some
popcorn from him at the time of the
Tippit slaying Burroughs and witness
Bernard Haire also said there was an
Oswald look - alike taken from the
theatre Perhaps it was he who
sneaked into the theatre just after
130

Inside the theatre Cry of Battle is on the screen Twelve

to fourteen spectators sit scattered between the balcony and
ground floor Brewer leads the officers onto the stage and

the lights come on He points to Oswald

JIM (VO)
In any case Brewer helpfully leads
the cops into the theatre and from
the stage points Oswald out

The cops advance on Oswald who jumps up as if expecting to
be shot

OSWALD
This is it

POLICEMAN
Kill the President will you

Scared Oswald takes a swing at a policeman He pulls out
his gun The officers close in on him from the rear and
front A wrestling and shoving match ensues One officer
gets a chokehold on Oswald and another one hits him

JIM (VO)
The cops have their man It was
already been decided - in Washington

Outside the theatre Oswald his eye blackened is led out
by the phalanx of officers They are surrounded by an angry
crowd

CROWD
Kill him Kill him

JIM (VO)
Dr Best Himmlers right hand man
in the Gestapo once said as long
as the police carries out the will
of the leadership it is acting
legally That mindset allowed for
400 political murders in the Weimar
Republic of 1923 - 32 where the
courts were controlled and the guilty
acquitted Oswald mustve felt like
Josef K in Kafkas The Trial He
was never told the reason of his
arrest he does not know the unseen
forces ranging against him he cries
out his outrage in the police lineup
just like Josef K excoriates the
judge for not being told the charges
against him But the state is deaf
The quarry is caught By the time
he is brought from the theatre a
large crowd is waiting to scream at
him By the time he reaches police
headquarters he is booked for
murdering Tippit

At the Dallas police station Dallas Police Captain Will
Fritz takes a call from a high official in Washington In
the background we notice Lee Oswald continuing to be
questioned by federal agents We hear Johnsons distinctive
Texas drawl but we never see him

JIM (VO)
No legal counsel is provided No
record made of the long questioning

HIGH OFFICIAL VOICE
Howdy there Capn Thanks for taking
care of us down in Dallas Lady
Bird and I will always be grateful

FRITZ
Thank you Mr President Were
doing our best

HIGH OFFICIAL VOICE
Capn I know youre working like a
hound dog down there to get this
mess wrapped up but I gotta tell
you theres too much confusion coming
out of Dallas now The TVs and the
papers are full of rumour ‘bout
conspiracies Two gunmen two rifles
the Russkies done it the Cubans
done it that kinda loose talk its
carin the shit outta people bubba
This thing could lead us into a war
that could cost 40 million lives
We got to showem we got this thing
under control No question no
doubts for the good of our country
you hear me

FRITZ
Yes sir

HIGH OFFICIAL VOICE
Capn you got your man the
investigations over thats what
people want to hear

The camera closes in on Oswald in the background He turns
to an unseen Deputy sad

OSWALD
Now everyone will know who I am

JIM (VO)
By the time the sun rose the next
morning he is booked for murdering
the President The whole country -
fueled by the media - assumes hes
guilty
In an underground police garage we see Jack Ruby being
allowed in via an interior staircase by his police contact
He moves towards the outer edge of reporters nervous

Oswald comes out with his two guards We see a repeat of
the assassination in stop time Rubys eyes Oswalds
do they recognize each other

JIM (VO)
Under the guise of a patriotic
nightclub owner out to spare Jackie
Kennedy from having to testify at a
trial Jack Ruby is shown into the
underground garage by one of his
inside men on the Dallas Police Force
and when hes ready Oswald is brought
out like a sacrificial lamb and nicely
disposed of as an enemy of the people
By early Sunday afternoon the autopsy
has been completed on him Who
grieves for Lee Harvey Oswald Buried
in a cheap grave under the name
Oswald No one

We see Oswald dying on the floor of the police station A
paramedic pushes in and starts administering artificial
respiration which only aggravates the internal hemorrhaging

At a Texas cemetery Oswalds mother weeps Oswald is buried
with a few people present but there are no details no dates
We see Marina whisked out by agents

CUT TO Kennedys funeral which in contrast attracts
thousands of mourners

JIM (VO)
Within minutes false statements and
press leaks about Lee Oswald circulate
the globe

FLASHBACK TO X reading about it in the New Zealand Airport
and then back to the courtroom in 1969

JIM
The Official Legend is created and
the media takes it from there The
glitter of official lies and the
epic splendor of the thought-numbing
funeral of JFK confuse the eye
and confound the understanding
Hitler always said the bigger the
lie the more people will believe
it Lee Oswald - a crazed lonely
man who wanted attention and got it
by killing a President was only the
first in a long line of patsies In
later years Bobby Kennedy and Martin
Luther King men whose commitment to
change and to peace would make them
dangerous to men who are committed

to war would follow also killed by
such lonely crazed men who remove
our guilt by making murder a
meaningless act of a loner We have
all become Hamlets in our country -
children of a slain father - leader
whose killers still possess the
throne The ghost of John F Kennedy
confronts us with the secret murder
at the heart of the American dream
He forces on us the appalling
questions Of what is our
Constitution made What is our
citizenship and more our lives
worth What is the future of a
democracy where a President can be
assassinated under conspicuously
suspicious circumstances while the
machinery of legal action scarcely
trembles How many political murders
disguised as heart attacks cancer
suicides airplane and car crashes
drug overdoses will occur before

they are exposed for what they are

Liz watches moved Susie Al and Numa are also there

the summation

friend

JIM
Treason doth never prosper wrote
an English poet Whats the reason
For if it prosper none dare call it
treason The generals who sent
Dreyfus to Devils Island were among
the most honorable men in France
the men who killed Caesar were among
the most honorable men in Rome And
the men who killed Kennedy no doubt
were honorable men I believe we
have reached a time in our country
similar to what life mustve been
like under Hitler in the 30s except
we dont realize it because Fascism
in our country takes the benign
disguise of liberal democracy There
wont be such familiar signs as
swastikas We wont build Dachaus
and Auschwitzes Were not going to
wake up one morning and suddenly
find ourselves in gray uniforms goose -
stepping off to work Fascism

Even Lou Ivon has come back to support his

the name of anti-fascism - it will

camp of the mind The super state

order to do so will rewrite history
as it sees fit George Orwells
Ministry of Truth warned us Who
controls the past controls the
future

The camera follows Jim around the courtroom

JIM
The American people have yet to see
the Zapruder film Why The American
people have yet to see the real
photographs and X - rays of the
autopsy Why There are hundreds
of documents that could help prove
this conspiracy Why have they been
withheld or burned by the Government
Each time my office or you the people
have asked those questions demanded
crucial evidence the answer from on
high has been national security
What kind of national security do
we have when we have been robbed of
our leaders Who determines our
national security What national
security permits the removal of
fundamental power from the hands of
the American people and validates
the ascendancy of invisible government
in the United States That kind of
national security gentlemen of
the jury is when it smells like it
feels like it and looks like it
you call it what it is - its Fascism
I submit to you that what took place
on November 22 1963 was a coup
detat Its most direct and tragic
result was a reversal of President
Kennedys commitment to withdraw
from Vietnam War is the biggest
business in America worth 80 billion
a year The President was murdered
by a conspiracy planned in advance
at the highest levels of the United
States government and carried out by
fanatical and disciplined Cold
Warriors in the Pentagon and CIAs
covert operations apparatus - among
them Clay Shaw here before you It
was a public execution and it was
covered up by like - minded
individuals in the Dallas Police
Department the Secret Service the
FBI and the White House - all the
way up to and including J Edgar
Hoover and Lyndon Johnson whom I
consider accomplices after the fact

The camera holds on onlookers shuffling and murmuring Clay
Shaw smirks smoking his cigarette The very grandiosity of
the charge works in his favor Jim is falling apart from
built - up strain and fatigue He looks over at Liz
gathering his spirit

JIM (VO)

There is a very simple way to
determine if I am being paranoid
here

(laughter)
Lets ask the two men who have
profited the most from the
assassination - your former President
Lyndon Baines Johnson and your new
President Richard Nixon - to release
51 CIA documents pertaining to Lee
Oswald and Jack Ruby or the secret
CIA memo on Oswalds activities in
Russia that was destroyed while
being photocopied All these
documents are yours - the peoples
property - you pay for it but because
the government considers you children
who might be too disturbed to face
this reality because you might lynch
those involved you cannot see these
documents for another 75 years Im
in my 40s so Ill have shuffled
off this mortal coil by then but
Im already telling my 8 year - old
son to keep himself physically fit
so that one glorious September morning
in 2038 he can walk into the National
Archives and find out what the CIA
and the FBI knew They may even
push it back then It may become a
generational affair with questions
passed down from father to son mother
to daughter in the manner of the
ancient runic bards Someday
somewhere someone might find out
the damned Truth Or we might just
build ourselves a new Government

like the Declaration of Independence
says we should do when the old one
aint working - maybe a little farther
out West

He approaches the jury

JIM
An American naturalist wrote a
patriot must always be ready to defend
his country against its government
Well Id hate to be in your shoes
today You have a lot to think about
Going back to when we were children
I think most of us in this courtroom
thought that justice came into being
automatically that virtue was its
own reward that good would triumph
over evil But as we get older we
know that this just isnt true
The frontier is where a man faces a
fact Individual human beings have
to create justice and this is not
easy because truth often presents a
threat to power and we have to fight
power often at great risk to
ourselves People like Julia Ann
Mercer SM Holland Lee Bowers
Jean Hill and Willie OKeefe have
come forward and taken that risk
(he produces a stack
of letters)
I have here some 8000 in these
letters sent to my office from all
over the country - quarters dimes
dollar bills from housewives
plumbers car salesmen teachers
invalids These are the people
who cannot afford to send money but
do these are the ones who drive the
cabs who nurse in the hospitals
who see their kids go to Vietnam
Why Because they care because
they want to know the truth - because
they want their country back because
it belongs to us the people as long
as the people got the guts to fight
for what they believe in The truth
is the most important value we have
because if the truth does not endure
if the Government murders truth if
you cannot respect the hearts of
these people
(shaking the letters
then this is no longer the country
in which we were born in and this is
not the country I want to die in
And this was never more true than
for John F Kennedy whose murder was
probably the most terrible moment in
the history of our country You the
people you the jury system in
sitting in judgement on Clay Shaw
represent the hope of humanity against
Government power In discharging
your duty in bringing the first
conviction in this house of cards
against Clay Shaw Ask not what
your country can do for you but
what you can do for your country
Do not forget your young President
who forfeited his life Show the
world this is still a government of
the people for the people and by
the people Nothing as long as you
live will ever be more important

(he stares into the

camera)
Its up to you

He returns to the table and sits The courtroom is still

CUT TO later in the same courtroom The jury files in
having reached a verdict Jim prepared sits with his staff
and Liz The jury foreman enters the courtroom

JURY FOREMAN
We find Clay Shaw not guilty on
all counts

Theres jubilation and commotion in the Court Shaw stands
happily shaking hands all over Members of the press run
for the phones In the corridor outside the courtroom the
press interviews the jury foreman

FOREMAN
We believe there was a conspiracy
but whether Clay Shaw was a part of
it is another kettle of fish

The camera moves to Jim who walks out past the banks of
reporters TV lights are in his face Liz is by his side

ENGLISH REPORTER
Mr Garrison the American media is
reporting this as a full vindication
of the Warren Commission do you

JIM
I think all it proves is you cannot
run a trial even questioning the
intelligence operations of the
government in the light of day

NEWSMAN 13
We understand that The Times -
Picayune will call for your
resignation - unfit to hold office
Youve ruined Clay Shaws reputation -
are you going to resign

JIM
Hell no Im gonna run again And
Im gonna win Thank you very much
If it takes me 30 years to nail every
one of the assassins then I will
continue this investigation for 30
years I owe that not only to Jack
Kennedy but to my country

He and Liz squeeze hands as they walk on
DISSOLVE TO WASHINGTON DC - Jim waits on the same park bench as earlier in the film
overlooking the Mall or the Lincoln Monument as X walks
up a little grayer a little more stooped wearing ill
fitting civilian clothes

JIM
Well thanks for coming

x
You didnt get that break you needed
but you went as far as any man could
bubba
(he sits next to Jim)
What can I do for you

JIM
Just speculating I guess How do
you think it started

x
I think it started in the wind
Money - arms big oil Pentagon
people contractors bankers
politicians like LBJ were committed
to a war in Southeast Asia As early
as 61 they knew Kennedy was going
to change things He was not going
to war in Southeast Asia Who knows
Probably some boardroom or lunchroom
somewhere - Houston New York - hell
maybe Bonn Germany who knows
its international now
CUT TO a New York lunch club or executive dining room

From the window we have a towering view of the City Four
men in their 50s to 70s - old men rich men talk at a
quiet table Their figures are shadowy and we overhear their
conversation obliquely across faces flared out by sun
bouncing off the skyscraper window

X (VO)
One worried sonofabitch with a few
million dollars turns to the others
with a few million dollars and
says something pretty direct like

RICH MAN 1
The sonofabitch is gonna get re-
elected by a bigger vote than ever
in 64 Its gonna be worse than
Roosevelt The country wont survive
as we know it

RICH MAN 2
I agree Bob it cant go on
(he looks to Man 3)

RICH MAN 3
and Bobby in 68 Somethings
got to be done

Looks pass among them Theres a pause and then

RICH MAN 1
Hes gotta go Lou The elections
gotta be stopped

There is a breathless moment with the thought in the air

RICH MAN 1
I talk to a lot of people I know
Im not the only one thinking this

RICH MAN 2
Whats the feeling in Washington
Jack

FLASHBACK TO the Pentagon in 1962

X (V0O)

-so calls are made Down to
Washington All over the world

We see a general meeting with another general They talk

X (VO)
Generals Admirals CIA people and
probably some people on the inside

Judases ready to go to war in
Southeast Asia

FLASHBACK TO the White House 1962 A general talks to one
of Kennedys staff - a bespectacled bright young Harvard
type

X (VO)
and maybe a Vice-President getting
separate memos from Vietnam eager
to get his backers the billions of
dollars in contracts for Southeast
Asia

In a White House office Lyndon Johnson meets with a cabinet
member a contractor and two military men

X (VO)
Kennedy like Caesar is surrounded
with enemies Something is underway

but it has no face Yet everyone in
the loop knows

The camera shows Washington DC buildings from strange
angles The feeling is still weird angled alien The
buildings are twisted

X (VO)
Money is at stake Big money A
hundred billion The Kennedy brothers
target voting districts for defense
dollars They give TFX fighter
contracts only to the counties that
are going to make a difference in
64 These people fight back Their
way One day another call is made

In a Pentagon office a man in civilian clothing is on the
phone his back to the screen This is Mr Y Xs superior
officer Shadows pervade the room An unshuttered window
overlooks the Potomac River and the White House

X (V0O)
maybe to somebody like my superior
whos been running the Mongoose
program out of Florida and who has
no love for Kennedy

VOICE ON PHONE
Bill were going We need your
help

X (VO)
Everythings cellurized No one has
said he must die theres been no
vote theres nothing on paper
theres no one to blame Its as
old as the Crucifixion the Mafia
firing squad one blank no ones
guilty because everyone in the Power
Structure who knows anything has a
plausible deniability There are no
compromising connections except at
the most secret point But whats
paramount is that it must succeed
No matter how many die how much it
costs the perpetrators must be on
the winning side and never subject
to prosecution for anything by anyone
That is a coup detat

Y
(into phone)

When

VOICE ON PHONE
In the fall Probably in the south
We want you to come up with a plan

CUT TO Documentary footage of - US Marines arriving in
full force on the beaches of Danang March 8 1965 as
another era begins and our movie ends

ON A BLACK SCREEN WE READ

In 1975 VICTOR MARCHETTI former executive assistant to
the CIAs deputy director stated that during high - level
CIA meetings during Shaws trial in 1969 CIA director RICHARD
HELMS disclosed that CLAY SHAW and DAVID FERRIE had worked
for the Agency and asked his assistants to make sure Mr
Shaw received Agency help at his trial

In 1979 RICHARD HELMS director of covert operations in
1963 admitted under oath that CLAY SHAW had Agency
connections

It is now known that in 1963 US military intelligence
controlled more agents than the CIA and had almost as much
money to spend It surfaced in the 1970s that the Army had
long been conducting surveillance and keeping files on
thousands of private citizens in the name of national
security The prime targets were dissident-left-wingers of
the kind Oswald appeared to be

CLAY SHAW died in 1974 of supposed lung cancer No autopsy
was allowed

WILLIAM SULLIVAN Assistant Director of the FBI died in
the early morning hours of November 9177 when he was mistaken
for a deer in an open field in New Hampshire Shortly before
his death Sullivan had a preliminary hearing with the HSCA

GEORGE DE MOHRENSCHILDT committed suicide just hours after
HSCA investigator Gaeton Fonzi located him

In November 1969 JIM GARRISON was re-elected to a third
term as District Attorney of Orleans Parish In June of

1971 he was arrested by Federal Agents on charges of allowing
payoffs on pinball gambling by organized crime In September
of 1973 after defending himself in Federal Court he was
quickly found not guilty of charges that appear to have been
framed against him Less than six weeks later he was
narrowly defeated for a fourth term as District Attorney

In 1978 Garrison was elected Judge of the Louisiana State
Court of Appeal in New Orleans He was re - elected in 1988
To this date he has brought the only public prosecution in
the Kennedy killing

ELIZABETH and Jim were divorced in 1978 He now lives in
the same house he lived in with Elizabeth She lives a block
away Their five children are grown

SOUTHEAST ASIA 58000 American lives 2 million Asian
lives 220 billion spent 10 million Americans air - lifted
there by commercial aircraft more than 5000 helicopters
lost 65 million tons of bombs dropped

BR Congressional Investigation from 1976 - 1979 found a
probable conspiracy in the assassination of John F Kennedy
and recommended the Justice Department investigate further
As of 1991 the Justice Department has done nothing The
files of the House Select Committee on Assassinations are
locked away until the year 2029

the National Archives in Washington DC
