SARA
Is this quest for redemption
coming from true remorse or are
you just worried that my sitting
on your car will leave a big dent

NELSON

SARA
Thats what I thought

Theres a flicker of recognition in her eyes as if she
has confirmed something in her own mind He gestures to
her -- get up She doesnt budge Annoyed he reaches
in his wallet and shoves a hundred dollar bill at her

myth --

Saras laugh starts as a snicker builds to a full-blown

howl

Deliberately chaotic Saras loft includes the fire pole
from the old station and plants galore As the puppies
carouse in a pen Sara sets two teacups on the kitchen
table where Nelson is sitting aware of the fact that
she is openly checking him out He tries to strike a
nonchalant pose

SARA
I can help you Nelson I have a

gift A special ability to help
men with problems

Thinking this is a seduction tactic he plays along

NELSON
I dont have problems

SARA
Thats usually the first sign

Nelson groans as she sits down across from him dead

egocentricity and control
freakism --

NELSON
Control freakism is not a word --

SARA
Look at you youre a workaholic
in such an advanced stage that all
your intimacy skills have withered
away to almost nothing Left
untreated Nelson you could
become emotionally extinct

Nelson rolls his eyes and drinks his cocoa checking out

loft with a wary look thinking who is this

NELSON
Out of sheer perverse curiosity
how does a lunatic like you help a
guy like me

SARA
You live in a box I could open
the lid let some light in

NELSON
Wow thats deep I feel cured
already just hearing about it

( )

youre inviting me to move in

emotion as he listens to Nelsons presentation

On the wall white sheets of paper cover boards underneath

Nelson is at the top of his game a consummate showman

holds up a board with an image on it -- a silly looking
50s style hot dog cartoon figure -- Doctor Diggety

head of steam)

a hot dog engulfed in flames the hot dog from hell

cooking hot dogs on a grill his family of savages
huddled behind him

NELSON

of a total babe in devil costume all bright reds and
cleavage holding a pitchfork a hot dog impaled on the
prong The gates of hell sizzling overhead The words
DOCTOR DIGGETY ITS A HOT DOG at bottom Nelson
pauses for dramatic effect

NELSON

INT NELSONS APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - DUSK

Nelson tries to unlock his door his hands are shaking so
badly he fumbles with the key labors to breathe

INT NELSONS APARTMENT - DUSK

The door opens and Nelson enters instantly deflating
Hes very relieved to find Angelica emerging from the
bedroom

She crosses toward the door past him He is shocked

NELSON
This is not a good time for this
Angelica

ANGELICA

Hard to believe but its not your

call Nelson I just finally

realized I cant stay

involved with a man who doesnt

even know hes not involved
(awkwardly)

So I guess this non-relationship

is officially a non-relationship

All her efforts to be cool are cracking She looks away
pushing the corners of her eyes trying to stop a tear

ANGELICA
I tried to get close to you I
did
NELSON
(panicking)
Wait -- please -- whatever I did --
or said I didnt mean Ill be
better --
She knows hes lying thats even more humiliating to
her
NELSON
Please -- dont go
ANGELICA

Im not staying just because you
dont want to be alone

She exits leaving Nelson alone in the silent penthouse
He approaches his display of glass and ceramics and
stares at them blankly Then with a sudden violent
swipe Nelson sends the entire collection crashing
Someone KNOCKS on the door

MANNY (0S)
Mr Moss You okay

( )

4500 31

NELSON
Im fine

Blood seeps from a cut on Nelsons hand

MANNY (0S)
You gotta delivery

NELSON
Leave it

MANNY (0S)
Im not sure you want me do that
sir Its from the loco lady
The other night She said I dont
deliver it personal she gonna --
(voice lowers)
Im too shy to say it Mister Moss

NELSON
I said leave it

Nelson wraps a towel around his hand Opening the door
he finds a tattered box Stamped on the lid NOVEMBER
The box starts to move Horrified Nelson lifts the
lid-- a Jack Russell puppy has a ridiculous-looking
Halloween hat tied to its head -- dangling from the hat
is a key

INT NELSONS BUILDING - LOBBY - DUSK

Nelson storms off the elevator carrying the box with the
WHINING PUPPY inside

NELSON
Manny Manny

Gone for the night Manny has left a Polaroid of himself
in costume on a sign that reads Manny Say Happy
Halloweens Activated by Nelsons movements an
electric GOBLIN next to the sign CACKLES demonically

NELSON
Shit
INT NELSONS APARTMENT - DUSK
On the phone Nelson paces as the hyperactive PUPPY races
through the apartment -- sees the fish in the tank and
starts madly BARKING

Stop it Shut up

DISPATCHER (VO)

NELSON
So what youre saying is if I

DISPATCHER (VO)
Please dont kill the dog sir

Nelson slams the phone down and watches in horror as the
BARKING PUPPY lifts a leg and pees all over the carpet

EXT NELSONS BUILDING - NIGHT
Holding the box Nelson leans over to talk to a CABBY

NELSON
I have an unusual request But I
will pay you two hundred dollars

CABBY
Get lost you sick son-of-a-bitch

As the CAB SCREECHES away Nelson becomes unhinged
Starts howling in rage Inside the box the PUPPY BARKS
in unison

INT SARAS LOFT - NIGHT

CHURCH BELLS RING at the stroke of midnight as Sara packs
a trunk Seeing beyond the area from night before -- the
loft includes an office cluster and a large bed A key
turns in the door The door swings open Nelson stands
there looking like a disheveled madman He carries the
box over to Sara

NELSON
Do me a favor Stay out of my
life Good-bye

She removes the puppy from the box kisses it then
flashes one of her winning adorable smiles

( )

SARA
Did you think about my offer

NELSON
The last thing I feel like doing
right now is playing the Sara
Deever Mad Hatter Game

He puts the box down and moves towards the door

What happened to your hand

NELSON
Nothing

SARA
May I look at it

NELSON
Why

Ernie has exhausted himself collapses on the floor
SARA
Because Im a vampire I know
some things about first aid
Nelson warily allows her to examine his hand
NELSON
What are you after What do you
want from me
She leads him to the bathroom as he studies her
suspiciously

INT BATHROOM - NIGHT

Sara treats Nelsons hand

Sara removes her sweater revealing a very persuasive
undershirt and then returns to working on his hand

NELSON
So this whatever you call
it --

SARA
Help

Sara stands and starts unbuttoning Nelsons shirt

NELSON
What are you doing

SARA
Taking your shirt off

NELSON
Why

( )

4500 35

SARA
So you can clean up

NELSON
Why

Out in the open now the sexual tension between them
intensifies

SARA
Because you smell like puppy piss

Sara takes the shirt to the kitchen

INT SARAS LOFT - BATHROOM - NIGHT (LATER)

Shirtless Nelson seems bewildered cant decide whether
to wash up or get out of there -- he catches his
reflection in the mirror studies it for an answer
mutters

NELSON
Just for the night

He turns on the water leans down to wash his face

INT SARAS LOFT - NIGHT
Sara sprays the shirt with detergent
She crosses the last day of October off a large wall

calendar and then tears the month away revealing
November

INT SARAS LOFT - NIGHT

Cleaned up Nelson comes from the bathroom Sara brings
him the shirt Nelson sniffs it and puts it on They
move closer

They kiss Channeling his desperation Nelson lifts her
onto the bed spins her down and pulls at her clothes

SARA
Wait Nelson stop stop

Sara pushes him back

( )

4500 36

NELSON

SARA
Look at me Gently Slowly

He starts in just as aggressively and again she stops
him

SARA
Nelson what are you doing

NELSON
What does it look like Im doing

SARA
Just take it easy It doesnt
have to be like this Weve got
all night

He stares at her for a long moment and then pulls away
NELSON
To hell with the whole goddamn
thing

Nelson yanks on his clothes

EXT SARAS BUILDING - NIGHT

Pouring rain Wearing his suit with no shirt Nelson
storms out the door Sara follows pulling her sweater
on

SARA
Nelson wait a second Would you
stop for one second

He keeps going A few pedestrians gawk but most keep
going

Nelson pulls Sara aside
NELSON
I have no words to describe how

totally whacked you are

SARA
What are you so pissed off about

( )

4500 37

NELSON
This has been the day from hell
and the absolute last thing I need
is you telling me what to do in
the sack

SARA
Please come back I wont tell
you what to do We dont even
have to do anything Just dont

go

For a moment Nelsons guard drops and his face betrays
how weary and shattered he is by the events of the day
She slips inside the opening in the crack

SARA
Tell me what you want me to do
Nelson and Ill do it Tell me

INT SARAS LOFT - NIGHT

Sitting on the bed Nelson stares intently at Sara
standing in front of him

NELSON
Take that off

Sara pulls her sweater over her head revealing the same
persuasive undershirt he saw earlier

NELSON
That too

Sara removes her shirt Exposed she waits for Nelson to
make the next move Gently he kisses her stomach As
he slowly works his way upward a swooning Sara grows
increasingly breathless

SARA
Would you like to be my November
Nelson

NELSON
Yes

Finally letting go they meet in a deep sensuous kiss

screaming -- a cross-eyed cat is gnawing at his toes

He grabs the cat by the scruff of neck ready to hurl it
then guiltily peeks to see if Saras around muttering

NELSON
Nice cat nice kitty
Saras gone Nelson abruptly drops the cat -- it streaks

across the bed and barrels out to the living area where
it is attacked by Ernie the puppy Sounds of FURRY
FIGHTING ensue

Nelson jumps out throws on his boxers momentarily
puzzled -- wheres the rest of his clothes Grabs his
cell phone and heads over to a TV set surrounded by
plants and ferns He tries to turn it on it doesnt
work Shrugging Nelson lowers himself to the floor and
begins a practiced routine of situps as he punches a

Diagonally across the street a vegetable market The
vendor a Chinese woman wags her finger and shouts at
pictures of her family propped up on her Buddhist altar
Sara gives her a wave and continues with Nelson a few
steps where they encounter ABNER He wears a red
balaclava practices balancing on one leg Seeing Sara
Abner stops balancing and avidly follows her as if she
were the Pied Piper Nearby a HOMELESS MAN rummages
through the garbage incongruously dressed in the chicest
gear imaginable

HOMELESS MAN
Sara can you spare fifteen bucks

SARA
Okay now youre just being
greedy Bruce I already gave
you those clothes

Nelson puts a brake on gasps

That sends alarms ringing in his confirmed bachelors

brain

somewhat unusual woman

She just looks at him so guilelessly he fumbles

NELSON
But we ah dont know where

best to clarify issues the
beginning of Im not ready
for I cant be your man-man

She starts to laugh so hard tears roll down her cheeks

SARA
You are the most egotistical
lunkhead Ive ever met
(settles down)
Its one month Nelson Get it

Now hes insulted And amazed Hes never been treated
this way before To save face he acts tough

NELSON
The truth is I dont have a
month Time is money

SARA
Okay How long can you put your
big fat lucrative career on hold
to try this thing out Waita
minute -- youre unemployed --

NELSON
(stung)
You know the more I think about

like an excuse to get laid

That hurts She flushes looks away He feels bad

ritzy building

INT SOCIETY LADYS HOUSE - DAY

Nelson stands stiffly behind Sara who gestures
expansively toward a rail-thin Nancy Kissinger-style
SOCIETY MATRON

SARA
-- Nelsons helping me today He
loves dogs

Sitting on the sofa floor chairs posed like perfect
little stuffed animals are Society Ladys six beloved
dogs Immaculately groomed heads daintily cocked front
paws folded over each other -- they are glaring coldly at
Nelson Sara pats their heads as she clips leashes on
them

SARA
And these are the best behaved
doggies in the whole wide world
arent they So elegant so
dignified Just like their mommy

SOCIETY LADY (MATRON)
(with supreme false
modesty )
I like to think so

4500 47
EXT PARK - DAY 59

Extremely put out Nelson walks beside Sara -- each holds
three dogs on leashes as they head up a path The dogs
dont pull or tug prance with military precision

NELSON
Always a thrill to explore new
career possibilities How much do
you charge for this

SARA
I dont do it for the money
(shouts to dogs)
Okay guys ready to be bad

All six tails begin to wag in furious unison
Incredulous Nelson watches Sara unclip all the
dogs from leashes and swat them on the rump

SARA
Raise some hell fellas and dont
tell Mommy

Suddenly nothing short of pure canine bedlam is
unleashed The six prissy DOGS go insane -- race up the
green YIPPING and HOWLING fighting with each other
rolling in the dirt scrambling through mud puddles
BARKING at babies Overjoyed Sara runs with the pack
clapping her hands and shouting

SARA
Bad dogs Bad dogs Im so proud
of you

Nelson rolls his eyes checks his watch Lurches back
when a wet muddy pooch shakes all over him

NELSON
Get away from me

Another dog barrels up to Nelson Desperate for a pet
the dog leaps up licks and slobbers all over Nelsons
hand

Disgusted Nelson yanks his hand away Sara shouts from farther
away

SARA
Be nice to Winston -- hes
insecure -- needs a lot of
affection

NELSON

I do not give affection to a
hairy dirty thing

( )
4500 48

Suddenly Nelson is screaming Winston has wrapped

himself around Nelsons leg and is feverishly humping
away

NELSON
Get him off me Im going to
kill him

SARA
Winston Thats enough Come
here boy

Winston comes running to her throws himself on the
ground and lets her rub his back Sara looks up to see
Nelson storming off the green

EXT VAN -— IN PARK — DAY

The van is parked near a hose Nelson sits glumly in
drivers seat Outside Sara hoses off all the filthy
dogs

INT VAN - DAY
Nelson checks his watch again Peers at Sara in the side
mirror

NELSONS POV - SIDE MIRROR

She is radiant clearly gets so much genuine joy from
what shes doing she couldnt look more beautiful

NELSON

in van stares moved in spite of himself Feels like a
jerk for being so uptight She comes to the window
breathless

SARA
Look at them -- arent they
incredible

The dogs are soaking wet shivering waiting patiently
for Sara to tell them what to do next

INT VAN - LATER

Trying to be a good sport Nelson awkwardly helps Sara to
dry the dogs with hair driers Winston starts to make a
move toward Nelson

Sara smiles to herself thrilled to see hes managed to
bend just this little bit

EXT PARK - ICE CREAM STAND - DUSKSUNSET

Sara is licking an ice cream cone counting money as she
waits for Nelson to make up his mind about his order
Her van is parked nearby

SARA
Thirty bucks not bad for a few
hours work

Nelsons tempted to say something glib but bites his
tongue However he cant help but register a look of
pity mixed with horror at how pathetic the earnings are

NELSON
Ill go for the lemon sorbet

She almost chokes -- the look on her face is not unlike
the one he just made -- pure pity and horror

SARA
Tell me something When was the
last time you spent the whole day
outdoors

NELSON
I think when my parents
dragged me to Alcatraz for the
day at the age of nine

He gets his sorbet and they start walking up the street
together

NELSON
Now you tell me something
SARA
Anything
NELSON

Whats so enlightening about what
we did today
(MORE )

4500 50

NELSON (CONTD)

(as she peers at

him confused)
Why is letting some dogs go wild a
better way to live than my way
Granted it was mildly amusing
but I gotta tell you my third eye
didnt open

SARA
These things take time You dont
have time

NELSON
No seriously its a question of
values Why is doing something
fundamentally trivial better than
living a responsible life boring
as that might seem to you

She is silent he presses on His tone is gentle
slightly teasing but theres real truth to what he says

NELSON
And who made you the expert the
doctor the guru Why do you have
all the answers

Still she is silent He teases her

NELSON
Come on show me your resume

Just then they pass a three-sided bus stop with a big ad
for DIVINE PETSNET -- Americas favorite pet store
Sara points

SARA
I used to own that company Divine
Pets

Nelson cracks up her timing as usual is brilliant

NELSON
Uh-huh

SARA
I did But after a while it
wasnt fun anymore So I quit

NELSON
Was that before or after you
toured as a stand-up comedienne

SARA
Oh I never did that

INT SARAS LOFT - NIGHT

Nelson stands there somewhat bemused as Sara comes forward
with a scarf smiling

SARA
This will be good for you

She starts to blindfold him with the scarf

SARA
Sharpen your instincts

He laughs oh goody a sex game tries to grab her

SARA

Not those instincts Okay this
is the object --

(as he grabs her

again)
Stop it -- I run around so you
lose track of where I am

(as hes pushing the

scarf down)
Dont do that leave it on --
count to ten and try to find me

She secures the blindfold and races off He pauses for a
moment then

NELSON
One two three -- Im gonna get
you Four five six -- I know
where you are Seven eight nine
ten
(pauses )

This is really stupid

He starts to walk bumps into a chair takes a few steps
more bumps into a table a few steps more and he trips
over a stool and crashes on the floor

NELSON
Ow shit

She runs over to him laughing

SARA
Oh my God youre really bad you
didnt even get close

NELSON
(tries to rip
off scarf)
This is funny

( )

4500

She helps him remove the scarf still laughing

Once

again his flight mechanism kicks in and he wants out

He takes a deep breath has to say something

NELSON
Sara youre not gonna be upset
when I leave tonight I told
you one day

SARA
Yep You told me And youre a
man of your word

NELSON
Dont get me wrong I appreciate
what youre trying to do -- crazy

as it may seem to me

SARA
Thats me Just crazy
(sweetly)

What are you more afraid of
Spending two consecutive nights
with a woman Or discovering this
whole thing might not be as crazy
as you think

He is flummoxed for a moment
NELSON
Hard to say Ive definitely
never met a woman like you
though

SARA
Good

He covertly checks the time

NELSON
So maybe I should just hit the
road

SARA
Stay for dinner I have your

SARA
Gay gay but very happy about it

Nelson has to ask

NELSON
And you and all these guys

Nelson gestures suggestively

SARA
Does it really matter

She flashes the most beguiling smile

NELSON
I suppose attraction has nothing
to do with it

The smile just becomes more beguiling meaning of
course

NELSON
Why a month

SARA
Long enough to be meaningful
Short enough to stay out of

trouble
NELSON
You defy every law of nature
I know
SARA
Good

The sound of a MAN LAUGHING drifts over from another
porch

SARA
Listen do you hear that What
a wonderful laugh

( )

SWEET NOVEMBER - Rev 5400 55

She cocks her ear listening to the MAN LAUGHING Then
they hear a BABY CRYING a BASKETBALL GAME down the
street a DRUNK WOMAN SINGING like an alley cat A
symphony of SOUNDS lives being lived around them

SARA
Doesnt life just take your
breath away

Once again he finds himself so moved by her he is
wordless There is a long silence between them

SARA
Whats your secret dream Nelson
NELSON
Im not much on that kind of
thing
SARA

Come on everyones got one

He listens to the SOUNDS and takes a leap -- lets
himself open up for a moment

NELSON
My father sold door-to-door
Vacuum cleaners life insurance
for a while he sold plastic food
We were kind of the joke of the
neighborhood And believe me the
neighborhood was a pretty grim joke
itself

SARA
Where did you live

NELSON

Daly City just up the freeway

(pause)
Anyway after dinner every night
my dad would shut himself in the
TV room and listen to 45s Frank
Sinatra Tony Bennett For a
year or so I desperately wanted
to be a singer

SARA
You thought it would make him
happy

SWEET NOVEMBER - Rev 5400 55A

NELSON
No I thought those guys were
everything he wasnt Successful
proud in control

He stops himself -- feels too exposed shocked that such
a sincerely-felt statement actually came from his lips
She feels his discomfort reaches over and takes his
hand

see Sara removing the last bit of her clothes before
slipping into bed

Raining Nelson in his empty sterile apartment watch-
ing TV Bored he flips from channel to channel Turns
it OFF Goes to his computer looks at some work in
progress on it Gets bored

SAME SCENE - LATER

Nelson surfing the net Bored he starts to disconnect
when he thinks of something He types in DIVINE
PETNET His face slowly registers shock as the site
comes up and he reads

CLOSE ON MONITOR

Web site Next to a picture of Sara and a blonde woman
who bears a striking resemblance to her -- the words
SARA AND CLAIRE DEEVER CO-FOUNDERS The company is

Reaching up to get the soap he tries a cupboard door
surprised to find it locked

NELSON
What do you keep in there
Secret nasty toys

She raises an eyebrow mock mysterious face He finds
the soap on a counter hands it to her

NELSON

She sighs with relief then beams happily as Chas
saunters into the bathroom with his morning cup of

coffee

CHAS
Did you switch beans or something
It tastes different

SARA
Hazelnut You dont like it

CHAS
Too perfumy Stick to classics --

Nelson is so outraged by this intrusion he slaps the

CHAS

She slaps the water with her hand

SARA
Stop it We have important things
to do today

INT MUNI TRAIN - DAY

Nelson and Sara stand in a rail car crowded with
commuters As the car jostles and bodies bump up against
him Nelson squirms with discomfort

NELSON
I still dont see why we couldnt
take a cab

SARA
Because I make the rules Nelson
Rules you must submit to utterly
and completely

NELSON
You know if you want to be a
dominatrix that badly why dont
we just go buy you the leather
and get it over with

SARA
Kinky Maybe even strangely
arousing But if we took a cab
wed miss out on all this

NELSON
Exactly

Sara studies Nelson stiff and impenetrable once again

SARA
You know what this train is
Nelson

NELSON

You mean besides a buffet of bad
breath and body odor

SARA
Its 55 lives All happening at
once in the exact same place at
the exact same time Imagine how
much hope and lust and fear and
love are in this car right now at
this very moment Look around

SWEET NOVEMBER - Rev 5800 61

NELSON
I try not to

SARA
I dare you Look at someone
anyone That woman by the door

A woman in her early 40s stands near one of the doors
her head leaning against the window as she stares out at
the passing city with a distant detached expression

SARA
What do you see

NELSON
Female 32-45 primary household
decision maker Watches 25 hours
of television a day spends 27
minutes at the grocery store
values price over brand

Ignoring him Sara gazes at the woman with empathy and
wonder

SARA
I think shes a mother I think
she loves her family so much it
hurts I think shed throw
herself in front of this train for
them if she had to And I think
when she gets into bed at night
she makes love to her husband like
he was the king of Egypt

As Sara enjoys the fruit of her imagination Nelson
reconsiders the woman this time seriously

NELSON
I think shes got a dead-end job
a husband she cant remember why
she married and a kid who doesnt
understand any of it

Nelsons grim assessment rolls over Sara like a cloud
darkening her entire disposition

SARA
Maybe Maybe its worse Maybe
nothing about life even makes
sense to her anymore Maybe some
days she wishes she could just
quit pretending and end the whole
goddamn thing

( )

SWEET NOVEMBER - Rev 5800 62

Nelson stares silenced by Saras sudden bleakness

SARA
You want to go to the dark side
Nelson I can get there faster
than you can Believe me

Looking away Sara takes a deep breath and then smiles
again as irrepressible as she was just moments before

SARA
But what for We see the world we
choose to see And I think my
first choice was a helluva lot
more fun dont you

As the train jostles and jerks Nelson and Sara search
each others eyes

This stuff is incredible

Watching now Sara smiles as proud as she is touched

a spider puppet

and brings it to life with a silly puppet voice

As Nelson continues counting Sara walks to a spot twenty
yards behind him and waits at the foot of a statue

NELSON
Twelve thirteen fourteen
fifteen sixteen seventeen
eighteen nineteen twenty

Nelson steps forward Then turning he walks straight
toward the statue and arrives at the exact spot Sara
stood just a moment before

Slowly he removes the scarf Sara of course is gone
All around Nelson shades of the park emerge in the
dawning light

Looking down at the scarf in his hands Nelson smiles
At the same time dawn breaks piercing the park with
glimmering amber light

Carefully wrapping the scarf twice around his neck
Nelson walks out of the park and into the street just

as a red Muni train slowly makes its way across the
awakening city its empty windows aglow in the dawn

FADE OUT

THE END
