EXT DENSE FOREST -— DAY
SUBTITLE SOMEWHERE IN CENTRAL AFRICA
High above As rain pours down upon the lush green foliage

A DROP OF PRECIPITATION plummets through the sky A rapid
seemingly endless descent until finally it finds

A MICROSCOPIC PATCH of what we can assume is HUMAN SKIN

The rain assaults the tributaries of cracked epidermis when
suddenly an insect BUZZES PAST two or three times then
finally lands on the flesh

A TSETSE FLY It twitches from left to right to left again
then suddenly sinks its long proboscis into the skin

BLOOD IS DRAWN instantly mingling with the droplets of rain
water covering the skin

And as the Tsetse drinks its fill were suddenly

CLOSE ON an eyelid as it flips open startled The pupil
quickly dilates

-and were back with the tsetse fly as a hand enormous
against the miniscule insect attempts to swat it

INSTANTLY WE PULL OUT as the tsetse nimbly escapes and
suddenly were once again

ABOVE THE FOREST as the rainfall turns into a torrent until
suddenly

BLUE SKIES And were high above looking down on somewhere
else

EXT MIDDLE CLASS NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY
This could be Anywhere USA but it isnt
SUBTITLE DOWNEY CALIFORNIA

Amid this typical suburban neighborhood sits a typical
SUBURBAN HOUSE surrounded by others that look the same

This one however finds distinction by the FOR SALE sign
posted on the front lawn

Its a nice place but it would be even nicer with a paint
job to cover the current faded splotchy gray
INT SUBURBAN HOMELIVING ROOM - DAY

HENRY POOLE stands in the center of the empty room Although
a little dishevelled at the moment its obvious theres a
handsome man underneath the stubble and wrinkled clothing

Elsewhere in this modest three bedroom MEG WYATT real
estate agent wanders deliberately through the house
extolling its virtues

MEG (0S)
You can see the massive closet space
walk-ins in every room And the bathroom
has been completely redone New tile
brand new sink and if you come back here
with me

Meg emerges from the hallway heading toward the back door
Henry stays planted in the living room stoic

MEG (CONTD)
-to the backyard Ill show you what
the previous owners did to the
landscaping Its really quite

HENRY
And the other one The house down the
street
Meg turns back
MEG

Oh Right Well I made the offer
like you asked but they didnt want to
sell The house isnt on the market

BENRY
You told them Id pay whatever they
wanted
MEG

I did Mr Poole Theyve lived there for
a long time They like it Its their
home

A subtle air of disappointment comes down on Henry as Meg
heads toward the back door

MEG (CONTD)
But back to this place Like I was
saying the landscaping is quite amazing
and

HENRY

How much
Meg stops in her tracks turns back

MEG
Im sorry

HENRY
How much

Meg steps to Henrys left side

MEG
Um Well theyre asking 325

Henry looks right at her

HENRY
(pointing to his right ear)
Can you talk into this other ear I cant
really hear very well out of the other
one

MEG

r ) Oh Im sorry

She steps around to Henrys right side

MEG (CONTD)
Well what I was saying was that theyre
asking 325

HENRY
OK

MEG
OK what

HENRY

OK Ill take it

MEG
Mr Poole Im pretty sure I can get them
to knock off 25 or 30 I mean this place
is nice but it definitely needs to be re-
stuccoed and--

HENRY
Its OK Ill take it for what theyre
asking

MEG
But you saw the outside The back the
north side of the house is practically
crumbling

HENRY
Youre exaggerating now Mrs Wyatt Ill
take it for what they want No
negotiating no repairs

MEG ‘
But Mr Poole

HENRY
You really should let this go Mrs
Wyatt The higher the price the more
your commission so

MEG
(seeing his point)
OK then Well how much are you
looking at for a down payment

HENRY
Nothing

MEG
Excuse me

HENRY

Ill pay cash Let me know where the
sellers want the money transferred and
start the paperwork Id like to be in
here in two weeks

Meg is stunned but theres no doubt Henrys serious Before
she can reply he turns and walks out

EXT SUBURBAN HOME -— DAY

Henry strides across the front lawn and climbs into his
Mercedes As he pulls away we see the back window of the car
has been completely shattered and COVERED WITH PLASTIC BAGS
AND DUCT TAPE

EXT MIDDLE CLASS NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY

With Henry inside the Mercedes pulls around the corner onto
the quiet street

The car comes to a stop in front of a CORNER HOUSE with a MAN
standing in front watering the lawn

For a moment the man is oblivious to Henrys stare but
quickly realizes hes being ogled

As his own uncomfortable gaze settles on the Mercedes Henry
just drives away

EXT SUBURBAN HOME - DAY

The Mercedes pulls up and Henry steps out the stubble on his
face grown to a beard He carries two plastic grocery bags
one with four bottles of champagne protruding

As he walks to the front door he pauses noticing the NEW
STUCCO JOB ON THE HOUSE now a vibrant forest green

INT HENRYS HOMELIVING ROOM — DAY

Henry stands in the middle of the room the front picture
window to his right He stares straight ahead at the blank
white wall in a daze a bottle of Cristal in hand

CLOSE ON THE TEXTURE OF THE WALL

INT HIGH-RISE CONDO - DAY

SUBTITLE DOWNTOWN CHICAGO

A lush palace in the sky its decor opulent and grandiose

LYDIA a stunning high heeled blonde clicks her way down
the HALLWAY and turns into

THE BEDROOM

Sprawled on the bed in a tangle of sheets lies Henry his
belly bulging out from under his T-shirt

He lays on his side eyes open half his face lost in the
pillow

LYDIA
You feeling OK Youve really been
sleeping quite a bit lately

HENRY
Im OK Just been really tired Maybe too
much ‘work or something

As Lydia turns away and steps over to the dresser SHE ROLLS

HER EYES at his last comment her true self shining through
A second later shes rummaging through her jewelry box

LYDIA
Well Im sure thats it Youre just
working too hard

She finds a pair of earrings and steps out of the room

Henry sits up still groggy his right cheek creased with the
wrinkles from his pillow

LYDIA (0S) (CONTD)
Dont forget you have to pick up the
wedding invitations today and my wedding
dress from the seamstress

HENRY
What I dont want to see the dress
before the wedding

LYDIA (0S)
And when you get to work make sure your
mother gives you her guest list

She pops back into the room

LYDIA (CONTD)
(gently sincere)
And dont let her push you around OK
This is my wedding

HENRY
Maybe you should talk to her

LYDIA
You want me to talk to your mother She
hates me Henry

HENRY
No she doesnt Shes just like you

Lydia halts peering at Henry irked at the comparison
HENRY (CONTD)
This would be a lot easier if you two
just worked it out yourselves

Lydia walks to Henry bends down gives him-a little kiss on
the forehead then in a whisper right by his ear

LYDIA
It would be easier if you took a little
control made a decision once in a while

She marches out of the room oblivious to his response

HENRY
What are you talking about I make
decisions all the time

Rubbing his cheek its hard to tell if Henrys trying to
convince himself or her

HENRY (CONTD)
(quietly)
I love you too
Henrys gaze fixes blankly at the wall
CLOSE ON THE TEXTURE OF THE WALL
INT HENRYS HOMELIVING ROOM - DAY

Henry stands right where we left him still peering at the
wall champagne bottle gripped in his hand

THROUGH THE PICTURE WINDOW we see a FURNITURE STORE TRUCK
pull up in front of the house

THE CHAMPAGNE CORK POPS nails the wall followed by a spurt
of Cristal pouring onto the floor

INT HENRYS HOMEBATHROOM - DAY

With the plastic bag discarded on the counter Henry shaves
as the MOVERS fill his home with new furniture

INT HENRYS HOMELIVING ROOM - DAY

Filled with brand new furniture now and the latest in stereo
and television equipment Empty boxes scattered around

Henry once again stands in the middle of the room a large
strip of BUBBLE WRAP in his hands as he pops away

INT SUPERMARKET — DAY

Henry stands at the checkout counter in front of PATIENCE a
young female clerk wearing glasses with lenses as thick as
they come

She rings up bottle after bottle of booze mostly wine a
couple of bottles of vodka and three boxes of Twinkies

Henry fixates on her NAME TAG for a moment unaware as
Patience eyeballs him a little smirk on her face

INT HENRYS HOMELIVING ROOM - DAY

Henry sits on the couch the coffee table overflowing with
all his junk food He indulges like we all wish we could
washing it down with swigs from a bottle of wine

AN HOUR LATER

The STEREO BLARES as Henry -- sprawled out on the couch his
pants undone -- deals with his food coma He looks like hes
about to throw up when the DOORBELL RINGS

At first he ignores it but whoevers pushing the button
persists More ringing Heavy knocking Finally Henry
staggers to the door turning down the stereo on the way

Opening the door he finds ESPERANZA MARTINEZ a stocky older
woman all smiles and speaking with a thin Spanish accent In
her hands a plate of tamales

ESPERANZA
Hi

Henry responds with a blank groggy stare

ESPERANZA (CONTD)
Im your neighbor from next door
Esperanza I just wanted to come by and
welcome you to the neighborhood Homemade
tamales

She hands him the plate of tamales

HENRY
Thanks

ESPERANZA
I used to be good friends with the man
who lived here I was actually the one
who found him

HENRY
Found him where

ESPERANZA
There in your kitchen He died of a
heart attack
(making the sign of the cross)
It was terrible Hed been laying there
for ten hours they think We were good
friends

Henry stares blankly

( )

ESPERANZA (CONTD)
So where are you from

HENRY
Not here Out of town

ESPERANZA
Oh

An awkward silence as Henry wipes the sleep from his eyes

This goes on until they both notice the neighbor from the
other side of Henrys home emerging from her house

DAWN STUPEK -- dressed in sweatpants running shoes and a
winter parka -- stretches for a moment on her porch then
heads off for a morning jog running past Esperanzas home

Esperanza turns her back to Henry as they watch Dawn jog by

ESPERANZA (CONTD)
Thats Dawn Stupek Shes training for a
race in the desert or something like
that Im not really sure Terrible
thing happened to her and her girl The
man her husband just left one day just
like that

As Esperanza turns back around to face Henry all she finds
is an empty doorway

Henry deep into his house now shuffles away through the
kitchen out the back door and into

THE BACKYARD

He pulls off his T-shirt strips to his boxers then drags an
old patio lounge chair out of the shade into the sun and
plops himself down

A FEW HOURS LATER --

Henry -- asleep on the lounge chair his skin a little pink
now -- is suddenly covered by a human shadow
MEG (0S)

You look like youre burning

Henrys eyes flutter open as he raises his head squinting at
the silhouette of Meg standing over him

MEG (CONTD)
Are you wearing any sunscreen

( )

Henry drops his head back down clearly not interested in
anything she has to say

MEG (CONTD)

I would have called before I stopped by
but you still dont have a phone

(she waits for a response but

gets nothing)
And I rang the -- Anyway I just wanted
to make sure you were OK and that the
move went well Did you notice we had the
house re-stuccoed and painted I got that
thrown in free of charge Well to you
anyway

HENRY
(sitting up)
Yeah I noticed Didnt I tell you not to
do any of that

MEG
Well I just thought

HENRY
Im not going to live here that long so
it was a waste of time

MEG
What do you mean youre not going to live
here that long

Henry looks away examining the house
HENRY
And for the record they did a lousy job
(points to the back wall)
Its all discolored right there

Meg takes a long look at the wall which does in fact have a
large splotch of discoloration

MEG
Well we can have that fixed

HENRY
No leave it alone It doesnt matter
Now please is there anything else
Meg is thrown by Henrys curtness

MEG
No Mr Poole there is nothing else

( )

With that Henry throws himself back into the lounge chair
and closes his eyes leaving Meg to show herself out

A moment passes before Henry once again opens his eyes at
the sound of some RUSTLING COMING FROM OVER THE FENCE AT DAWN
STUPEKS HOUSE

Curious he gets up to check it out Sliding a cinder block
next to the fence he steps up and peers over

THE YARD is seemingly empty and silent until he hears
A RECORDING OF THE CONVERSATION HE JUST HAD WITH MEG

Henry freezes a bit freaked out then looks down directly
below him on the other side of the fence to find

»-MILLIE STUPEK Dawns 8 year old daughter crouched down
back against the fence She holds a small tape recorder in
her hand

Henry watches her for a moment listening to the recording

HENRY
Hey

Millie jumps out of her skin and bolts away into her house
Although a bit irked Henry cracks a smile

INT STRIP JOINT - NIGHT

Henry sits at the rail a beer and a wad of twenty dollar
bills on the counter before him

He watches intently as a STRIPPER on stage dances just inches
from his face

Somehow he seems unaffected even as he slips two twenty
dollar bills into her G-string

INT STRIP JOINTVIP LOUNGE - NIGHT

TWO STRIPPERS straddle Henry one on each knee in a tandem
lap dance

INT HENRYS HOMEBEDROOM - NIGHT

The two strippers lay on the bed clad in lingerie waiting
A light rain begins tapping on the window

INT HENRYS HOMEBATHROOM — NIGHT

Henry stands in his boxers before the mirror a strip of
condoms in his hand and a bottle of vodka on the counter

He stares at himself as a subtle look of disgust creeps onto
his face

THE BEDROOM

STRIPPER 1 stands by the dresser her back to the door
while STRIPPER 2 remains sprawled out on the bed

Henry walks in bottle in hand startling Stripper 1 She
whips around

STRIPPER 1
Oh Hi We were wondering where you
were
Henry eyeballs her He knows she was up to no good
HENRY
I always thought it would be harder to
get a stripper to come home with me
STRIPPER 2
Yeah I used to think that too You ready
to have some fun
Henry takes a moment glumly considering it then
HENRY
You know I dont think so You better
go Both of you

STRIPPER 2
Getting cold feet buddy

She rises from the bed and slinks over to Henry draping
herself around him

STRIPPER 2 (CONTD)
Are you sure you want us to go

Henry fights his male impulses remaining ridged

HENRY
Yeah Im sure

He peels the girl off of himself as the RAIN BEGINS TO POUR

HENRY (CONTD)
You can keep the money you took from my
wallet Just leave the credit cards

A FEW MINUTES LATER

The torrent of rain continues as Henry stands over the
dresser and grabs his picked over wallet Flipping though the
contents making sure his credit cards are still there he
suddenly stops finding something unexpected

A SMALL WALLET SIZED PHOTO He peers at it fondly a sweet
memory there

A FEW MINUTES LATER

Henry stands at the foot of his bed taping the photo to the
wall A tiny speck amid the barren plaster

INT HENRYS HOMELIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Henry a bit groggy sits on the couch the vodka bottle in
one hand and the VCR remote in the other He hits play And
turns up the volume

The TV comes to life and we see VARIOUS MICROSCOPIC VIEWS OF
A TSETSE FLY accompanied by the elegant voice of a BRITISH
NARRATOR

BRITISH NARRATOR (VO)

With twenty three known species the
tsetse fly derives its name from the very
sound the insect makes when airborne The
name tsetse itself quite literally
means “fly in Tswana the language of
the territory formerly known as
Bechuanaland and currently identified as
Botswana

As the documentary continues Henry in his drunken stupor
fades in and out of consciousness

INT HENRYS HOMEBEDROOM - DAY

Morning Henry sprawled out on the bed and a half empty
bottle of vodka still gripped in his hand fails to notice

«THROUGH THE WINDOW ESPERANZA STANDING OUTSIDE IN THE
BACKYARD SEEMINGLY STARING INTO THE HOUSE

A quizzical look on Esperanzas face slowly grows into one of
awe as Henry wakes He really couldnt be more hung over

( )

Esperanza suddenly makes the sign of the cross as Henrys
sleepy gaze finally falls OUT THE WINDOW He freezes at the
sight of her as she

genuflects making the sign of the cross again

EXT HENRYS HOMEBACKYARD - DAY

ON THE BACK DOOR as Henry walks out

The yard is empty no sign of Esperanza Henry makes his way
over to the spot where she was standing and turns to face the

house

He scrutinizes the whole wall taking a step back to get a
better perspective and finds Nothing

EXT ESPERANZAS HOUSE- DAY

Henry still in his underwear stands at the front door
annoyed It opens to reveal Esperanza poised in the doorway
phone pressed to her ear

As he begins to speak she holds up a finger silencing him

Esperanza continues talking on the phone as Henry turns to
see Dawn Stupek jogging by in her winter attire For a moment
they lock eyes

ESPERANZA
(into phone)
Yes Exactly I dont know anything
for sure I just OK OK Thank
you

She hangs up as Henry turns back to face her
ESPERANZA (CONTD)
Mr Poole Im so glad you are here
Something very wonderful has happened

HENRY
Why were you in my yard just now

ESPERANZA
Did you not look

HENRY
Were you looking in my window

ESPERANZA
Of course not Did you not see

( )

HENRY
See what

She rushes past him Henry follows
EXT HENRYS HOMEBACKYARD - DAY

Henry and Esperanza stand before the back wall staring for a
long moment

ESPERANZA
You dont see it

HENRY
See what I see a bad stucco job

ESPERANZA
Youre not looking

Henry glares at her

HENRY
At what All I see is a water stain from
a crappy stucco job

Frustrated Esperanza steps to the wall blessing herself
again Reaching up she traces the outer edges of the stain
with her finger

Henry watches annoyed yet intent

HENRY (CONTD)
I dont see anything

ESPERANZA
(stepping back next to him)
Youre not looking La cara de Dios
Mira la The face of God The face of
Christ

Henry peers at the wall and for the first time we see the
WATER STAIN IN ITS ENTIRETY Although vague at best the
stain does in fact hold the semblance of a face

Henry rolls his eyes at her ridiculous claim turns and walks
away Esperanza follows

HENRY
OK

( )

ESPERANZA

Mr Poole You see it dont you Its
a miracle right there on your house It
is a sign from God

HENRY
The only sign I see is that you are a nut
bag

ESPERANZA

I know its hard to believe but the
proof is right there

HENRY
Right

ESPERANZA
Youre just going to ignore it

HENRY
No Im going to ignore you

Henry reaches the back-door steps inside and slams the door

Esperanza stands dumbfounded at his reaction until a moment
later when the door whips open and Henry pops out once again

HENRY (CONTD)
Wait a second Who were you talking to

ESPERANZA
(confused)
To you
HENRY
No no I mean at your house on the
phone

Esperanza just stares afraid to answer until the sound of
the FRONT DOORBELL RINGS THROUGH THE HOUSE

Henry leers at Esperanza quite sure she is behind this
unexpected visitor

EXT HENRYS HOMEFRONT PORCH - DAY

FATHER VINCENT SALAZAR a young cleric waits on the porch
until the front door cracks open

Henry stands behind the door peeking around

HENRY
r Yes

FATHER SALAZAR
Hi Im looking for Esperanza Martinez
She said she would be here Im Father
Vincent Salazar from Saint Raymonds
Catholic Church She called and said to
meet her here regarding

Suddenly the door is pulled back as Esperanza muscles her way
in front of Henry

With Henry still in his underwear the sight makes Father

Salazar a bit uncomfortable

ESPERANZA
Thank God you are here

She takes hold of Fr Salazars arm dragging him through

HENRYS HOUSE

Henry trails behind quickly darting into his bedroom and

ESPERANZA
Its in the backyard Ill show you

HENRY
What are you doing Stop

emerging seconds later as he threads his legs through a pair
of pants He rushes into

THE BACKYARD

Esperanza and Father Salazar stand before the wall as Henry
approaches

HENRY
OK Enough I did not say you could
come in here I want you both to leave
right now

ESPERANZA
(to Father Salazar)
You see

FATHER SALAZAR
Well I do see something
(to Henry)
Im very sorry about the intrusion Mr

HENRY
Poole

FATHER SALAZAR
Mr Poole I apologize

ESPERANZA
So you do see it

FATHER SALAZAR
Well I can see that it could be
interpreted as a face Thats quite
clear But the face of Christ Esperanza
Imnot quite sure we can make that leap

HENRY
Thank you You see Now please will
both of you just leave

Esperanza steps to the wall excitedly pointing at the
features of the supposed face

ESPERANZA
No no no Look look You can see
the eyes here and the beard here and
look on top the thorns the crown of
thorns from the crucifixion

FATHER SALAZAR
Well I can see how that could be that
These types of things shouldnt be easily
discounted But we do have to take these
things at face value No pun intended

HENRY
Well the face value of this is that it
is a water stain from a shitty stucco
job

FATHER SALAZAR
Youre probably right Mr Poole and by
no-means does the church condone any kind
of frivolous claims of this nature but--

HENRY
But nothing This little game is over
That is not the face of Christ Now
please leave

Father Salazar can see there is no point going on

FATHER SALAZAR
Youre right Mr Poole weve imposed
enough Esperanza please Lets go

Father Salazar grabs Esperanza by the arm dragging her
toward the gate As they pass through Esperanza turns back
toward Henry

ESPERANZA
Mr Poole you cant ignore this Mr
Poole Dont you believe in God

As they exit the yard A FLY BUZZES IN HENRYS FACE adding
to his annoyance He swats it away a little too
aggressively

Henrys mother a distinguished lady at the moment
genuinely concerned

( )

MELINDA

Melinda comes around the desk and plants a kiss on Henrys
forehead oddly reminiscent of Lydias earlier kiss

MELINDA (CONTD)
Your wedding is going to be perfect and

Henry vigorously rubs his temples seemingly exhausted from
the conversation

MELINDA (CONTD)

MELINDA
I really wish you would just go see a
doctor The pains not going to go away

Henry takes a long penetrating look at his mother
EXT MIDDLE CLASS NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY

Henry walks along the sidewalk Reaching the END OF THE
BLOCK he stops facing

THE CORNER HOUSE

He stands there staring

After a long moment the Homeowner dragged by his WIFE
appears in the FRONT WINDOW They are both irked at the sight
of this stranger standing at the edge of their lawn

The Homeowner crosses to the front door then steps out onto
the PORCH

HOMEOWNER
Can I help you

HENRY
(cupping his right ear)
Sorry

HOMEOWNER
I said can I help you

HENRY
No Im just looking at your house

HOMEOWNER

Henry stops himself

HENRY (CONTD)
Sorry

And with that he walks away

INT HENRYS HOMEBEDROOM - DAY

Henry walks into the room a tall vodka on the rocks in hand
and a cigarette dangling from his lips Two steps in and he
comes to a sudden stop

THROUGH THE WINDOW he catches sight of little Millie Stupek
standing in his BACKYARD staring at the wall her tape
recorder gripped in her hand

EXT HENRYS HOMEBACKYARD - DAY

Millie stands in the center of the yard peering at the wall
almost in a trance-like state

Henry peeks around the corner of the house spying

But it isnt long before Millie senses his presence She
turns to look just as Henry snaps his head out of sight

Henry shrinks back not sure if hes been seen then musters
the courage to peek around the corner again

As he inches his head forward he is suddenly BULLDOZED BY
MILLIE running full force trying to get around him

She buries her shoulder into his groin taking Henry down in
an instant then quickly runs away ignoring the fact that
shes dropped her tape recorder

Henry writhes in pain on the ground hands cupping his
erotch

A FEW MINUTES LATER

Henry sits on his lounge chair recovering tape recorder in
hand

He hits the play button and hears HIS CONVERSATION WITH
FATHER SALAZAR AND ESPERANZA

He rewinds hits play again This time its the SOUND OF A
WOMAN CRYING

He listens closely moved at the genuine sorrow It almost
looks like hes about to cry too until suddenly

the sounds of the tape recorder are overtaken by HEAVY
POUNDING coming from Dawn Stupeks backyard

Shaking it off Henry creeps over to the fence peers over
and catches sight of

( )

--Dawn on her patio wrapped in a parka scarf and wool cap
running on a treadmill in front of her washer and dryer

The exhaust hose from the dryer strapped to the front of the
treadmill blowing hot air in her face

As he watches taking a good long look at Dawn the sobs on
the tape dissipate until finally he hears

DAWN
(through the tape recorder)
Youre OK Youre OK

He sinks back down behind the fence thoroughly perplexed
INT DAWN STUPEKS HOUSE - DAY

Dawn opens the front door to discover Henry standing on her
porch with the tape recorder

DAWN
Yes

Henry is taken aback for a moment at the sight of Dawn
dressed normally without her winter running attire She is
quite striking attractive in an innocent way and yet her
eyes have an unmistakable sadness

HENRY
Um Hi I live next door

DAWN
I know Ive seen you

HENRY
Right right Anyway your daughter I
guess dropped this in my backyard

Henry notices the curtain on the front window inch back as
Millie peers through and for a moment he locks eyes with the
little girl

DAWN
Youre kidding Im so sorry I didnt
know she was back there Ive told her a
million times not to play in other
peoples yards

HENRY
Its no problem She was just walking
around
He hands Dawn the tape recorder

DAWN
Did she tape you

HENRY
Um I dont know

DAWN
She does that Tapes people

HENRY
Why does she do that

A slightly pained smile creeps onto Dawns lips

DAWN
I dont know

Dawn suddenly shuts down a bit flustered

DAWN (CONTD)
Im sorry I have to go Thank you for
bringing this back to Millie Ill make
sure she stays out of your yard

Before Henry can utter a word the door is slammed in his
face leaving him slightly disappointed

Then somewhat impulsively he goes to ring the doorbell
again his finger stopping an inch away from the button then
clenching into a fist as he reconsiders

INT SUPERMARKET - DAY

Henry stands at the checkout counter Patience ringing him up
once again Its the usual booze cigarettes Twinkies

She stops for a moment removes her glasses and cleans them
off with her apron Scrunching her face she squints at Henry

PATIENCE

You having another party
HENRY

Sorry
PATIENCE

Ive seen you in here a couple of times
buying the same stuff Thatll be 6842
I figured you were throwing some parties

HENRY
No No parties

( )

PATIENCE

Well that doesnt look like a very
healthy diet

HENRY
Its just a phase

EXT HENRYS HOME - DAY
Esperanza stands at the edge of the house near the walkway
leading to the backyard She scans the street on the

Lookout

A moment later THREE ELDERLY LADIES scurry out from the
backyard

ESPERANZA
Hurry Hell be back any minute

Esperanza follows the women across Henrys lawn back to her
own house

HENRYS CAR

-rounds the corner giving him a perfect view of the four
ladies traipsing across his front yard

He screeches to a halt in front of his house and pops out of
the car

HENRY
Hey

Esperanza looks back but continues into her house

HENRY (CONTD)
I saw you Stay out of my backyard

EXT HENRYS HOMEBACKYARD - DAY
Henry marches into the backyard grocery bags in hand

The sight of FOUR TALL GLASS VOTIVE CANDLES placed at the
base of the stained wall brings him to a sudden halt

Indignant he steps to the wall drops his bags crouches
down and begins to gather up the candles As he rises
something on the wall catches Henrys attention

At the corner of each eye A LITTLE TRICKLE OF A DARK RED
SYRUP-LIKE SUBSTANCE DRIPS SLOWLY like tears

Henry leans in only inches from the leakage curious and
concerned He sets down the candles picks up a twig dabs it
onto the leaking substance and takes a close look

EXT ESPERANZAS HOUSE - DAY

Esperanza makes her way down the porch escorting her three
friends to their car when suddenly Henry comes rushing
toward her from his yard the four votive candles cradled in
his arms Hes not happy

HENRY
Hey Stop right there

The women freeze as Henry marches up

HENRY (CONTD)
Are these yours

Esperanza and the women stare sheepishly at Henry nervous
Henry drops the candles shattering the glass votives

HENRY (CONTD)
Does that look like a church back there
That is my house my property You cant
just walk in and start doing whatever
these candles do And you put paint on my
wall Thats vandalism damn it

ESPERANZA
Mr Poole we did not paint your wall

HENRY
Oh yeah Then whats this

Henry shoves the twig inches from Esperanzas face She
stares at the tip covered in what looks like blood

Esperanza grabs the twig studies it then touches the tip
with her own finger

ESPERANZA
Thats not paint Mr Poole And we did
not put it there —

HENRY
Well then what is it

Esperanza peers at him a severe look creeping onto her face

ESPERANZA
Mr Poole it is blood

( )

(27

Henry realizes what Esperanza is implying just as she and her
three friends begin to make the sign of the cross

Rolling his eyes Henry turns and marches back to his house
HENRY
(under his breath)
OK psycho
(then audibly)
Just please stay out of my yard
EXT HENRYS HOMEBACKYARD - DAY

CLOSE ON THE STAIN -- as a blast of water washes over
clearing the blood away

Henry stands a few feet away holding the hose as if it were
a 357 Magnum

Satisfied with the job he tosses the hose to the ground and
steps up for a closer look The blood is gone

MINUTES LATER

-Henry comes out the back door two big garbage bags in
tow

He makes his way to the side of the house dumps the bags
into a trash can then marches back toward the back door

Suddenly Henry plants himself staring in disbelief at the
Stain and the oozing blood which has inexplicably returned

INTEXT HENRYS CAR - DAY

Henry rounds the corner from his street onto the main
boulevard

As he merges with the traffic he catches sight of Dawn
jogging along the boulevard clad in her usual winter attire

Passing her Henry fixes his gaze noticing DAWN SOBBING as
she continues her run

He stares at her perplexed then turns back to the road
ahead and gasps as he is forced to SLAM ON THE BRAKES
avoiding a rear end collision with the stopped car in front
of him

INT SUPERMARKET - DAY

A long line of CUSTOMERS at the only open register and Henry
is at the end of it still frustrated

From behind an end display of soda pop Patience peeks her
head out spying on Henry A little smile creeps onto her
face

She takes off her glasses cleaning them off again
Our view of Henry through
PATIENCES POV

-is drastically blurred nondescript splotches slightly
more focused around the periphery and surrounded by varying
degrees of light

Replacing her glasses Patience marches out taps him on the
shoulder and motions for him to follow her She leads him to
her register

Henry unloads his basket onto the counter an assortment of
cleaning fluids bottles of bleach and scrub brushes

PATIENCE
(re the bleach)
I hope youre not using that as a mixer

Henry stares at her blankly

PATIENCE (CONTD)
Cause youre not getting vodka

HENRY
Oh No Im just cleaning up a mess

She nods then after an awkward pause

PATIENCE
Did you know that in 1985 Gorbachev
right after he became the Partys General
Secretary tried to eradicate vodka in
Russia

Blank stare from Henry

PATIENCE (CONTD)
The people wouldnt have it though Isnt
that weird I mean something like 30000
Russians die a year from alcohol
poisoning but the people they want what
they want

Patience looks him over curiously as she rings up his items

( )

PATIENCE (CONTD)
Whats wrong with you

Although her tone is as sincere as it could possibly be
Henry is visibly taken aback by the question

HENRY
Sorry

PATIENCE
Well I dont mean to be rude its
just Something is clearly wrong with
you I dont know if youre sad or angry
or both but youre not normal I thought
maybe you might want to talk about it

HENRY
You want-me to tell you why Im sad and
angry while you ring up my bottles of
bleach

PATIENCE
So it is both Sad and angry

HENRY
I didnt say that

PATIENCE
Yes you did

HENRY
I was indulging you Being polite

PATIENCE
OK Indulge me some more Tell me
whats wrong

HENRY
(annoyed)
You know what Just ring up my shit
please I appreciate your concern but I
just want to get out of here

PATIENCE
OK Sorry I asked

HENRY
Dont be

An awkward moment of silence looms as Patience continues to
ring up Henrys items

( )

PATIENCE

Its OK to be sad you know I mean Ive

been really sad before Sometimes you

have to feel sad to remind yourself that

youre alive Its better than feeling

nothing right Thatll be 3489
Henry ponders her comment with a curious unsettled stare
then hands her a couple of twenty dollar bills She makes
change hands it back and Henry rushes out

PATIENCE (CONTD)
Have a nice day

INTEXT HENRYS CAR - DAY
Henry drives still perturbed

He stares at the odometer watching as the numbers turn from
2999 TO 3000

INT DOCTORS OFFICEEXAMINATION ROOM - DAY
SUBTITLE DOWNTOWN CHICAGO
CLOSE ON a full urine specimen cup the lid being replaced
CLOSE ON a digital scale the numbers flickering
CLOSE ON a needle plunging into an arm
CLOSE ON a vile filling with blood

CLOSE ON a hand wrapped in a surgical glove the fingers
dipping into a jar of Vaseline

Finally we find Henry sitting on the edge of an exam table a
hospital gown draped around him He seems to have been
waiting for quite a long time

He shifts uncomfortably slides off the table paces a bit
then impatiently whips open the door and steps into

THE HALLWAY

No one around in either direction Suddenly a disembodied
female voice floats down the hall

NURSE (0S)

Mr Poole please stay inside your exam
room Well be with you shortly

( )

HENRY
Its just that its been--

NURSE (0S)
Well be with you shortly Mr Poole

Resigned to his sentence Henry turns back to enter his exam
room and unexpectedly COLLIDES WITH ANOTHER PATIENT also in
a hospital gown MR LAWRENCE

HENRY
Jesus Im so sorry

MR LAWRENCE
My fault I wasnt paying attention

NURSE (0S)
Mr Lawrence

MR LAWRENCE
(confused)
You hear that

NURSE (0S)
Mr Lawrence please stay inside your
exam room

Both men shuffle into their respective rooms closing their
doors behind them

INT EXAM ROOM — LATER

Henry once again sits on the edge of the exam table staring
at DOCTOR RONALD FANCHER a file in hand who has just
delivered his diagnosis

HENRY
So theres nothing wrong with me

DR FANCHER
Not from what Ive seen so far Henry
(flipping open the file)
Mild fevers here and there Occasional
headaches and just a general lethargy
Right

HENRY
Yeah Like a flu I guess

DR FANCHER

Any loss of concentration or general
coordination

( )

HENRY
A little

DR FANCHER
Are you sleeping more than usual

HENRY
Well I want to But yeah a little
more than usual I just I dont
know I just dont feel like myself

DR FANCHER
What do you mean

Henry ponders the question trying to find the words to
articulate until finally Dr Fancher offers some help --

DR FANCHER (CONTD)
How did you feel before you started
feeling how you feel now

Henry thinks for another moment not quite sure then slowly
the glum realization hits him --

HENRY
I dont remember not feeling like this

Fancher eyes Henry then jots something into the file

DR FANCHER
It sounds like youre a little fatigued
Stressed But thats it Well keep an
eye on the fevers and you should probably
get a little more exercise Less coffee
Eat better Lose a little weight even
Does wonders for the self-esteem

Dr Fancher steps to the door opens it

DR FANCHER (CONTD)
Ill call you next week when your blood
and urine come back In the meantime stop
worrying so much Like I said theres
nothing wrong with you

Henry nods accepting the doctors words maybe even a little
relieved as the doctor steps out

DR FANCHER (CONT’D)
Say hello to your mother for me

INT ELEVATOR - DAY

The doors slide open and Henry steps into the empty elevator
a thin uncertain smile on his lips

Pressing the lobby button he waits for the doors to close
An inordinate amount of time passes giving way for a
pensiveness to surface on his face

And finally as the doors begin to slide shut Henrys smile
fades --

And suddenly the PIERCING SOUND OF TIRES SCREECHING bring us
back to

INTEXT HENRYS CAR - DAY

--as Henry snaps out of his daydream grinding to a sudden
halt at a crosswalk after just HITTING A PEDESTRIAN

The person rolls off the hood and disappears in front of the

car
HENRY
Oh shit Oh my God Oh my God
Henry darts out of the car into
THE STREET

racing around to the front to discover Dawn sprawled out
on the asphalt wearing her winter gear

DAWN
You god-damn stupid mother fucking
dick face Theres a stop sign right
there

Apparently shes not hurt
HENRY
Oh my God Im so sorry Are you OK I 8
was stopped I just didnt see you
crossing Im so sorry
DAWN
What the hell are you doing You could
have killed me

Dawn and Henry simultaneously realize they know each other

HENRY
Dawn

( )

DAWN
Henry What the hell

HENRY
Im so sorry Dawn I wasnt paying
attention Are you OK

As Dawn starts to get up Henry helps grabbing her by the
arm

DAWN
Yeah just completely freaked out

HENRY
Maybe we should go to the hospital make
sure theres nothing broken

DAWN
No no Im OK Just shaken up

HENRY
Can I at least drive you home

Dawn considers the offer taking a deep breath still
regaining her bearing

HENRY (CONTD)
Please

DAWN
Sure sure Thats probably best

INT EXT HENRYS CAR — DAY

Henry drives with Dawn in the passenger seat as she peels off
her parka

HENRY
Im really sorry

DAWN
Its OK You can stop saying that Im
not hurt No harm done

HENRY
I dont know what happened I guess I was
just I dont know Daydreaming
DAWN
Yeah well You should maybe save the
dreaming for when youre asleep
An awkward pause

HENRY
Can I ask you something I saw you
earlier running in the neighborhood
and I was wondering why you were--

Henry stops himself changing course

HENRY (CONTD)
Why do you dress like that when you run
It seems kind of dangerous Heatstroke or
something

DAWN
Im training for a race in the desert

HENRY
In the desert

DAWN
Yeah its called the Badwater
Ultramarathon 135 miles through Death
Valley

HENRY
Youre kidding Over how many days

DAWN
A little over two The winners usually
finish in like fifty-something hours

HENRY
Have you done this before

DAWN
Nah first time

HENRY
Why would you do something like that

Dawn looks as if shes just heard the most ridiculous
question in her life then ponders for a moment

DAWN
Well Because

Henry looks over waiting for more as Dawn squirms under his
stare

DAWN (CONTD)
(curt)
You should keep your eyes on the road

Getting the hint Henry lays off

INT HENRYS HOMEBACKYARD - DAY

Henry stands inches from the wall a pair of goggles covering
his eyes as he raises two bottles of bleach above his head
then showers the stain

ESPERANZA (VO)
And what about Veronicas Veil Veronica
wiping the blood and sweat from the face
of Christ as He carried the cross to His
own death

With the bottles empty he grabs a scrub brush and begins to
vigorously scour the wall

ESPERANZA (VO) (CONTD)
Only to later find his perfect likeness
burned in blood onto the garment

INT RECTORY - DAY

Father Salazar sits behind his desk with Esperanza in the
guest chair before him holding A TATTERED OLD SCRAP BOOK
FILLED WITH NEWSPAPER CLIPPINGS

FATHER SALAZAR
Well Yes but That story dates back
to the twelfth century Esperanza And
there were churches all over Europe
claiming to have the one and only
Veronicas Veil And none were ever able
to prove theirs was the real thing so

Esperanza undeterred flips through her scrap book finding
a specific clipping and placing it onto the desk

EXT HENRYS HOMEBACKYARD — DAY

Henry still standing before the bleach drenched wall
scrubbing furiously

ESPERANZA (V0)
OK But what of all the others old and
new The baby Jesus on the rose petal Or
the tree in West Virginia with the face
Or the weeping Madonna statue in
Australia Or the one in Italy Or the
underpass in Chicago with the Virgin
Mary

INT RECTORY FATHER SALAZARS OFFICE - DAY

Esperanza continues laying out clipping after clipping before
Fr Salazar

ESPERANZA
Or the window with the condensation in
Boston And what about Our Lady of
Guadalupe

Fr Salazar does everything to quell his impatience with
Esperanza

FATHER SALAZAR
Esperanza please Stop And besides
those last few are different

ESPERANZA
Different how

FATHER SALAZAR

Well for one thing theyre not Jesus

Those were all images of the Virgin

Mother And as for Guadalupe that

phenomenons real The cloak with her
image on it is still on display inside

the basilica in Villa Madero Intact

Perfectly preserved

ESPERANZA
Why cant the face be the same

FATHER SALAZAR
First of all its only been a week And
the cloak with the image of the Virgin
Mother is hundreds of years old 1531
I think And of course its been
scientifically tested with no conclusive
evidence of what exactly keeps it from
deteriorating

Esperanza goes to speak but before she can get a word out
Father Salazar holds up his hand to stop her

FATHER SALAZAR (CONTD)
And dont even mention the Shroud of
Turin The controversy around that thing
has gone on for centuries

Esperanza seems offended at Father Salazars terminology

ESPERANZA
That thing

FATHER SALAZAR
Esperanza please I didnt mean any
disrespect You know that Im just
saying that even if the Shroud is real
Jesus was not the only guy with long hair
and a beard back then

Father Salazar stands makes his way around the desk and sits
in the guest chair next to Esperanza

“FATHER SALAZAR (CONTD)
Look You cant go running around
claiming miracles are happening without
some sort of ecclesiastical
investigation Plus technically no
miracle has occurred And the church
cant follow up on every claim from
someone who thinks they see Christ in a
potato chip These things happen all the
time

ESPERANZA
- This is no potato chip Its bleeding

FATHER SALAZAR
(surprised)
Excuse me

ESPERANZA
The face is bleeding It started the
other day

FATHER SALAZAR
You saw it You saw blood coming out of
the wall

ESPERANZA
From the eyes like tears

FATHER SALAZAR
How can you be sure its blood and not
something else

ESPERANZA
Ive bled before Father

Father Salazars face softens compassionately knowing what
shes referring to

( )

FATHER SALAZAR
Yes I know OK I can request that
the diocese look into this but we cant
go in there without Mr Pooles
permission We cant test to see if this
is an unexplained phenomenon without him
letting us onto his property And we
cant force him Understand

Esperanza gazes beyond Father Salazar forming a plan

FATHER SALAZAR (CONT’D)
(a warning)
Esperanza

ESPERANZA
(snapping out of it)
Of course I understand Thank you
Father Thank you so much

She stands heads toward the door stopping and turning to
face him for a brief moment

ESPERANZA (CONTD)
Father this is a miracle This is for
me And you know why This miracle is
for me so I know hes OK

EXT HENRYS HOMEBACKYARD - DAY

Henry stands before the wall empty bleach bottles discarded
at his feet the scrub brush its bristles now frayed and
worn still gripped in his hand

The paint around the stain serubbed away has left the face
now even more distinct

Henrys shoulders droop exhausted as he realizes his
efforts have been futile

INT HENRYS HOME - DAY

Henry swings the front door open to discover Esperanza
standing there with a giant platter of freshly made TAMALES

ESPERANZA
Hola
HENRY
(cautiously)
Hi

( )

ESPERANZA

I made these for you

Henry is hesitant to accept but is forced as she hands him
the platter

HENRY
Thats really not necessary Besides you
already gave me some of these

ESPERANZA
I know But I see the pizza boy here
almost every day You cant live on that
alone

HENRY
Youd be surprised

Esperanza fidgets awkwardly in silence mustering up a
question As she goes to speak Henry interrupts

HENRY (CONTD)
Well thanks again

And with that Henry closes the door and Esperanza is left

e mouth agape

INT KITCHEN - DAY

Henry sits at the kitchen table surrounded by at least six
discarded corn husks

Henry grabs them glancing at the overflowing trash can in
the corner then steps to the sink and shoves the husks into
the garbage disposal

As he turns on the faucet and flips on the disposal a
horrible grinding sound fills the room Quickly turning it
off he watches as the water bubbles over clogging

His frustration is distracted by the sound of SOMETHING BEING
DRAGGED OUTSIDE ALONG THE SIDE OF THE HOUSE

EXT HENRYS HOMEBACKYARD - DAY

Following the sound Henry makes his way to the side of the
house where he finds Esperanza surrounded by bags of his
garbage struggling with an overflowing trash can as she
drags it toward the front of the house

Henry is baffled

( )

HENRY
What are you doing

ESPERANZA
Im taking out your trash

HENRY
I can see that Why

Esperanza keeps hauling the can away

ESPERANZA
Well Look at this Theres garbage
everywhere Very dirty Unhealthy I
thought Id help you You know just
trying to be a good neighbor The trash
truck is coming in about an hour

HENRY

(suspicious)

Right You dont have to do that Ill
do it later

ESPERANZA
Its really no problem

Esperanza scoots away around the corner can in tow as Henry
looks on dumbfounded

EXT HENRYS HOME - ONE HOUR LATER

A GARBAGE TRUCK drives away

A moment later Esperanza emerges from her home scurries
across Henrys lawn and proceeds to bring in Henrys empty
trash cans

Henry watches from the front window shaking his head

INT KITCHEN -— DAY

Henry stands in front of the sink still clogged with foul
looking water pouring in a bottle of Drano

THIRTY MINUTES LATER

»ethe clog remains the same Exasperated he begrudgingly
crawls under the sink prepared to take care of the problem
himself

As he clears some space he comes across an old CIGAR BOX

( )

Curious he pulls it out settles himself onto the floor and
opens the box Inside he finds a collection of old photos

Flipping through the pile almost all the photos have the
same MAN - of varying ages - in the shot

One photo in particular catches his eye

The Man older standing with Esperanza holding hands Henry
ponders the picture

EXT HENRYS HOME — DAY

Esperanza kneels on the grass a pair of pruning shears in
her hand as she weeds the edges of Henrys lawn Next to her
stands one of her older friends JOSIE who came to see the
face earlier

JOSIE
Youre wasting your time

ESPERANZA
The only waste of time would be not to
try

JOSIE
He wont allow it the man is clearly an
atheist

ESPERANZA

The faithless sometimes need something to
help them believe Either way its not
about what he believes or doesnt
believe

Henry emerges from his home marching over to Esperanza and
Josie

HENRY
Now what are you doing

ESPERANZA
Weeding Youre lawn is so sloppy

HENRY
OK This is ridiculous People dont
just start doing things for one another
for no reason What are you up to

ESPERANZA
Im not up to anything

( )

JOSIE
Yes you are

ESPERANZA
No Im not

JOSIE
Yes you are

ESPERANZA
Dont listen to her She senile She
doesnt know what shes saying Im just
being a good neighbor and I like to

garden
JOSIE
Just ask him
HENRY
Ask me what
ESPERANZA
Josie you need to mind your own
business
HENRY

Ask me what

Esperanza hesitates

Esperanza

JOSIE
She wants to bring the church in to test
the face in your backyard to see if its
a miracle

HENRY
Youve got to be kidding me

JOSIE
Nope Shes pretty crafty

HENRY
Well its not going to happen You could
build me a goddamn gazebo back there and
Im still not going to let your crazy
church people into my house That face or
whatever it is is nothing Its a stupid
water stain not a miracle

struggles to her feet wounded at his retort

ESPERANZA
But how can you say that

44

HENRY
I dont want to talk about this I just
came out here to give you this

Henry hands Esperanza the picture of her with the old man
She peers at it then suddenly begins to weep

JOSIE
(rolling her eyes)
Oh God Why did you go and do that

HENRY
What Why is she crying

JOSIE
Thats Leo He was her boyfriend before
he died He lived in your house

ESPERANZA
He was such a good man

JOSIE
He was an asshole

ESPERANZA
Dont say that He was not You just
didnt understand him

A pained nostalgia washes over Esperanza as she eyes the
photo

ESPERANZA (CONTD)
He always wanted to be a better man

JOSIE
(to Henry)
Seriously he was an asshole

ESPERANZA
He was difficult sometimes but not to
me He just didnt like most people

JOSIE
Most

ESPERANZA

OK Almost everyone But he liked me
We took care of each other

HENRY
Well theres a cigar box full of
pictures in the house I found them under
the sink You should come get them

INT HENRYS HOMEKITCHEN - DAY

Esperanza sitting at the kitchen table her back to Henry
slowly flips through the stack of photos while Henry attacks
the clogged sink with a plunger

ESPERANZA
He was so handsome And such a good
lover

Still focused on the plunging Henry cringes at the thought

ESPERANZA (CONTD)
I never thought Id find someone like
him I was ready to just be old alone
Id never been married Never found
anyone and then one day five years ago
or so Leo moved in and that was it
Years of being alone and one man manages
to take it all away A lifetime of
sadness and suddenly I couldnt even
remember what it was like to be sad
(pause)
And then he died And I remembered
(pause)
And I prayed to God to help me stop
feeling the pain And to let me know that
he was OK And now the face appears the
face of God

HENRY
You think that stain out there is the
answer to your prayers

She turns to face him no need to answer Henry sighs

HENRY (CONTD)
What is it that you want the church to
do

Esperanza suddenly perks up

ESPERANZA
Just to come in and test the wall test
the blood to see what it is If its
nothing then its nothing and I wont
bother you again No one will

( )

Henry peers at Esperanza his gaze drifting down to the pile
of photos in her hand

HENRY
Alright Just one day

Esperanza rises darting to Henry giving him a hug

He stiffens at her touch uncomfortable at first but then
slowly and ever so subtly giving in to something For him
the elusive human embrace

ESPERANZA
Of course Thank you Mr Poole Thank
you Youll see Youll see
Everything happens for a reason
(pause)
You should try bleach For the clog

Esperanza finally releases Henry leaving him drained
INT HENRYS HOMEKITCHEN - A FEW MINUTES LATER

With Esperanza gone Henry stands over the sink pouring a
bottle of bleach down the drain and watching as the clog
gurgles away

Turning away he shakes his head mildly impressed then
looks to the kitchen table where he notices Esperanzas
pruning shears

EXT ESPERANZAS HOUSEPORCH — DAY

Henry steps up with the pruning shears in his hand to
discover the front door wide open

As he goes to knock on the door jamb he hears a quiet
sobbing coming from inside

Considering his options for moment his curiosity gets the
best of him and he silently leans in THROUGH THE DOORWAY
peering into

ESPERANZAS LIVING ROOM

-where he discovers Esperanza kneeling in the corner of the
room her back to the door Before her sits a little table
adorned with multiple candles and few flowers all
surrounding a FRAMED PHOTO OF LEO

As she goes to place the picture Henry found on the shrine

she stops sensing his presence She turns around a wounded
look in her eyes

( )

HENRY
(holding up the shears)
You forgot these

Theyre both a little embarrassed at having to share this
private moment Then almost as if confessing something

ESPERANZA
He was a good man my Leo I dont want
to forget him

Henry nods then sets the pruning shears down on a chair and
as he turns to leave

ESPERANZA (CONTD)
Mr Poole why did you come here

HENRY
(pointing to the shears)
For the thing You left them

ESPERANZA
No no I mean next door the house

HENRY
Oh I I grew up here

ESPERANZA
In that house

HENRY
No down the street They wouldnt sell

ESPERANZA
But why did you come back

HENRY
I just needed to To disappear

Esperanza stares waiting for more as Henry just turns and
walks out

INT RESTAURANTDOWNTOWN CHICAGO - NIGHT

Amid the bustling eatery Henry his mother Melinda and his
fiancee Lydia sit a table Wine glasses all around

MELINDA
So all the doctor said is that youre
tired

Henry fidgets a bit clearly not comfortable lying about his
current state

( )

Amused by

HENRY
He said fatigue Probably from work and
all the wedding stuff

MELINDA
Dont take this the wrong way son But I
dont see how you could possibly be doing
any less at work

HENRY
What exactly would be the right way to
take that

MELINDA
You know what This is my fault Ive
been too easy on you Youve never had to
work for anything

LYDIA
You mean just like you

Melinda leers at Lydia as she backpedals

LYDIA (CONTD)
That came out wrong

MELINDA
I got my money from the divorce but I
kept it because of my hard work And
youre no one to talk

LYDIA

Whats that supposed to mean
HENRY

OK thats--
MELINDA

Im a terrible mother Thank God I only
had one child--

HENRY
Thats enough--

MELINDA
(pouring herself more wine)
Of course you turned out like this
Everything you have is because I gave it
to you Youve never had to earn
anything make any choices

all this Lydia tries to stifle a little grin

Henry peers at his mother a slight shake of the head as a
sour contemptuous smile spreads across his face

And as Melinda takes a gulp of wine she peers at Henry over
the rim of her glass Her eyes narrowing judging
Vitriolic

MELINDA (CONT’D)
You smile just like your father

Henrys smile fades overtaken by a quiet disillusionment
His eyes drift from his mother to Lydia both sipping their
blood red wine -- oddly in the same manner -- both eying him
with a subtle distaste

THE SOUND OF STATIC slowly builds over the restaurant
ambience as we CUT TO

INT HENRYS HOMELIVING ROOM - NIGHT
CLOSE ON a static filled TV screen as the VOLUME IS RAISED

SUDDENLY ON THE SCREEN we see the microscopic image of a
tsetse fly sinking its proboscis into what appears to be a
patch of human flesh An infinitesimal speck of blood spills
as the insect satiates itself

Henry slumps on the couch the remote control in his hand

BRITISH NARRATOR (V0)
Feeding on the blood of animals and
humans the tsetse fly delivers the
trypanosome parasite into the blood
stream putting the victim on course for
a slow agonizing death

bed his body emaciated shivering terribly

BRITISH NARRATOR (VO) (CONTD)
Once introduced to a host the parasite
begins its subtle attack initially
causing headaches and joint pain
ON THE SCREEN Blood is drawn from the debilitated patient
Henry troubled and slumped even further continues to watch
BRITISH NARRATOR (VO) (CONTD)

Hemorrhagic fevers much like those that
accompany ebola -follow shortly after

( )

ANOTHER PATIENT flails uncontrollably fighting the ties that
bind him to the bed He wretches painfully as the parasite
takes hold of his body

BRITISH NARRATOR (V0) (CONTD)
By the time the infection reaches the
central nervous system the victim
becomes susceptible to sudden mood
changes escalating to uncontrollable
fits of aggression In the end the
afflicted fall into deep coma and die

STATIC ONCE AGAIN TAKES HOLD OF THE SCREEN as we discover

-Henry laying down now curled in the fetal position a
subdued suffering washing over him

INT SUPERMARKET — DAY

Henry emerges from an aisle approaching the check out
counters His basket holds the usual assortment of booze and
junk food

His gaze lands on Patience at the far end of the store
working the 10 items or less line She faces away not
noticing Henry

In front of him the only other open check-out harbors a
WOMAN SHOPPER towing two carts over-flowing with groceries

She places each item on the check-out counter with maddening
precision almost as if piecing a puzzle together

Henry ponders his choices And picks the eternal wait
behind the Woman Shopper

A moment later he sees Esperanza across the store entering
Patiences empty line Patience and Esperanza greet each
other enthusiastically chatting away

Esperanza suddenly notices Henry She points him out to
Patience as if she had just been talking about him

ESPERANZA
(waving)
Mr Poole Mr Poole

As he gives a feeble wave Patience turns to face him She

picks up the phoneintercom and is suddenly speaking through
the PA

( )

PATIENCE

(over the PA)
Mr Poole I can help you over here

Mortified Henry declines the offer with a wave of his hand
The woman shopper turns to face him

WOMAN SHOPPER
Id go if I were you

HENRY
Im fine right here thanks

PATIENCE
(over the PA)
Suit yourself Mr Poole Youre just
going to get sadder and angrier while you
wait

The Woman Shopper gives him a long judgemental look as Henry
sinks further in his skin

INT HENRYS HOMEBACKYARD - DAY
A CAMERA FLASHES as Henry whips open the back door
A PHOTOGRAPHER snaps shot after shot of the stain
Henry steps out as Esperanza and Father Salazar round the
corner into the yard They are followed by a MEDICAL LAB

WORKER carrying a stainless steel case

ESPERANZA
Over here There theres the blood

As the Medical Lab Worker steps to the wall with Esperanza
Father Salazar walks over to Henry

FATHER SALAZAR
Mr Poole good morning How are you

HENRY
Fine

FATHER SALAZAR
You know I want to thank you for this
for letting us do this Esperanza is a
good woman very devout and when she gets
something in her head

( )

HENRY
Yeah well I think this is a big waste of
time But youre right she seems like a
good woman So

FATHER SALAZAR
Youre a very skeptical man Mr Poole

HENRY
You think this is real

FATHER SALAZAR
No I didnt say that But I do think
that anything is possible With faith or
hope

HENRY
That sounds remarkably
(searching for the word)
Naive

Henrys comment catches Father Salazar off guard

HENRY (CONTD)
No really Anything is possible So if
I have faith or whatever I can fly I
should just go jump off a building and
start flapping my arms Or or Even
better I could just--

Seemingly on the verge of revealing something Henry stops

himself as

The impact
he becomes

Father Salazar smiles compassionately

FATHER SALAZAR
No offence Mr Poole but you sound like
a little boy Youre talking about
fantasy Im talking about choosing to
believe in something Anything

of Father Salazars words dissipates for Henry as
distracted by

the Medical Lab Worker as he removes a vile and a

stainless

steel scraper from his case He proceeds to take a

blood sample from the wall Esperanza looks on bemused

FATHER SALAZAR (CONTD)
So turns out I have to write a report

HENRY
What do you mean a report

( )

FATHER SALAZAR
As part of the investigation So the arch
diocese will pay for all this And I have
to interview you

Henrys shoulders droop This is getting more annoying by the

second

S HOMELIVING ROOM - DAY

Henry and Father Salazar notebook in hand scribbling away
sit opposite one another Henry faces away from the kitchen

Henry looks over his shoulder as a CONSTRUCTION WORKER
carrying an electric jigsaw steps in through the back door
and makes his way into the bedroom

FATHER SALAZAR
(looking up from his notes)
So a month

HENRY
(turning back)
Whos that guy

FATHER SALAZAR
Oh Um He needs to open up the
wall where the stain is

HENRY
What Why

FATHER SALAZAR
They need to look at whats behind the
stain as well To be sure its not man
made Well repair the wall it will look
as good as new Dont worry

HENRY
Dont repair it Its OK

FATHER SALAZAR
Dont be silly Were not going to leave
a hole in the wall

HENRY
It doesnt matter I wont be here that
long What were you saying Where were
we

FATHER SALAZAR
You wont

Henry bristles

HENRY
Father can we just get on with this

Father Salazars questioning is thwarted by the SOUND OF A
JIGSAW buzzing through the house Henry doesnt react He
just stares waiting for the next question

They both raise their voices

FATHER SALAZAR
OK so How long after you moved in did
the stain appear

HENRY
A few days maybe a week Esperanza
actually noticed it first

Father Salazar takes notes

FATHER SALAZAR
And has there been any work done to the
house prior to this

HENRY
(struggling to hear)
What

FATHER SALAZAR
I said had there been any work done
prior to the stain appearing

HENRY
Yes The house was restuccoed

FATHER SALAZAR
(struggling to hear)
Im sorry

HENRY
I said--

FATHER SALAZAR
Mr Poole maybe we should step outside

EXT HENRYS HOME - DAY
Henry and Father Salazar step out onto the porch

HENRY
Look Father the house was restuccoed
right before I moved in and thats it

HENRY (CONTD)
Theres nothing else really to talk
about

FATHER SALAZAR
Maybe not about the house

Henry slumps shaking his head He knows what hes getting at
and does not want to go there

FATHER SALAZAR (CONTD)
Why did you say you were not going to be
here long

HENRY
I dont want to talk about this

FATHER SALAZAR
Yes you do Otherwise you wouldnt have
mentioned it

HENRY
(almost offended)
What makes you think you know me that
well

FATHER SALAZAR
I dont think that But anyone with two
eyes can see that something is wrong with
you

Henry considers his observation suppressing his annoyance
FATHER SALAZAR (CONTD)
Im a good listener when youre ready It
cant be that bad

Henry watches as Father Salazar steps off the porch heading
into the backyard

A FLY SUDDENLY BUZZES around Henrys face He flails his arms
wildly trying to swat the pest

Henry settles down as the RECORDED VOICE OF FATHER SALAZAR
rises from the bushes to the side of the porch

FATHER SALAZAR (CONTD)
(recorded)

cant be that bad

crouched between the foliage tape recorded in hand

HENRY
What are you doing in there

A blank stare from Millie

HENRY (CONTD)
You know there are bugs in there

HENRY (CONTD)
Big bugs

Henry crouches down eyeing Millie with an almost softhearted
curiosity

INT CORNER HOUSEHALLWAY - DAY

Henry stands at the end of the long hallway peering into one
of the BEDROOMS Surveying Seemingly searching

Esperanza looms behind watching him waiting for some sort
of reaction until he finally steps into the --

BEDROOM --

A childs room Esperanza waits by the door curious as
Henry steps to the closet opens it and stares at the hanging
clothes for a moment be fore whisking the clothing aside

With a clear view of the closets back wall Henry crouches
down eying a specific spot his finger tips passing over it

HENRY
They painted the inside of the closets
Very thorough

He stands turning to face Esperanza

HENRY (CONTD)
This house was the last place I remember
being happy And even so the memory is
just barely there

Esperanza scoots out of the way as he steps back into the --
HALLWAY --

and movesllto the next room peering inside as well She
follows

HENRY
My life with my parents before they got
rich and split up seemed so simple
Easy My mother was a different person
Warm Loving

A dark sadness comes over him as he moves to the next
doorway

HENRY (CONTD)
And then the divorce happened and it
sucked the life out of her

(MORE )

HENRY (CONTD)

And shes been trying to suck it out of
me ever since like it was my fault

(turning to face Esperanza)
And the strangest thing about standing
here again is that this is doing
absolutely nothing for me I mean Ive
never been a sentimental person but I
thought - Well I dont know I was
expecting something

They reach the end of the hallway turning into the --
LIVING ROOM —-

The Home Owner and his Wife stand near the front
uncomfortably waiting for this to be over

HOME OWNER
Did you find what you where looking for

Henry considers the personal depths of the simple question
His sullen gaze clearly states no

HENRY
The layout isnt exactly what I remember
Except for that
He points to the FIREPLACE

HOME OWNER
We had a wall knocked down

HENRY
(pointing to an open space)
Right there

HOME OWNER
Yup

HENRY
It makes a big difference Thank you

And with that hes out the door
EXT MIDDLE CLASS NEIGHBORHOOD —- DAY

Henry marches away from the corner house Esperanza scurries
after him finally catching up

ESPERANZA

Mr Poole Im sorry it wasnt what you
thought it would be

HENRY
Dont be It was an incredibly generous
gesture on your part

ESPERANZA
At least now you know

HENRY
Know what

ESPERANZA
Know what it would be like to go back
into your home

HENRY
Yeah now I know Its like nothing

(quietly to himself)

Theres nowhere to hide

ESPERANZA
What did you expect You cant go to the
past to fix the present

HENRY
You sound like a fortune cookie

Rolling his eyes Henry crosses the street toward his home

No answer Just keeps walking

steps back and peers in the doorway

Millies bed sheets pulled back is empty

Dawn flicks on the light as she enters

MILLIES ROOM
and begins her search Under the bed in the closet etc
DAWN

to be playing games
She rushes out of the room back out into

»-a subtle panic coming over her

Dawn pops into the KITCHEN then darts across the hallway
into the LIVING ROOM

EXT DAWN STUPEKS HOUSEBACKYARD - NIGHT
Dawn bursts through the back door panicked

She races around the yard looking in every possible hiding
place Finally she peers over the fence into HENRYS
BACKYARD discovering

---Millie standing a few feet away from the stained wall

DAWN (CONTD)
Millie What are you doing

Millie looks over for a brief moment revealing a tear
streaked face

DAWN (CONTD)
Whats wrong baby

No answer She just turns back toward the stain Dawn dashes
away heading toward the front of the house

EXT HENRYS HOMEBACKYARD - NIGHT
As Dawn comes through the gate Millie sobbing slowly

reaches out to the wall pressing her palm onto the stain

( )

Dawn approaches cautiously

DAWN
Whats wrong baby Why are you crying

At that moment Henry comes through the back door clad in
underwear He sees Dawn

HENRY
Whats going on

DAWN
(ignoring Henry)
Millie baby
Henry notices Millie her palm still pressed to the wall

HENRY
Millie What are you doing

Millie startled looks to Henry then pulling her hand off
the wall turns back to her mother and quite deliberately
utters

MILLIE
Mama

Dawn freezes bewildered at the sound of her daughters
voice

Millie runs into her arms
INT DAWN STUPEKS HOUSEMILLIES BEDROOM -— NIGHT

Millie is sound asleep

Dawn takes a long look at her daughter then exits moving
into

HENRY
Is she OK

DAWN
Yeah Shes asleep

HENRY
Good

Dawn plops down onto the couch on Henrys left
Henry stands moving to Dawns other side and sitting

HENRY (CONTD)
Sorry my ear Im--

DAWN
Right sorry Esperanza told me about
that How did that happen

Henry shifts uncomfortably hesitating

HENRY
Its kind of a long story Ill tell you
another day

She gives him a long penetrating look

DAWN
What happened out there

HENRY
You tell me

DAWN
She hasnt spoken a word in over a year
since her father walked out She loves
her daddy so much The prick

Henry peers at her an awkward smile wishing he could offer
some consolation

DAWN (CONTD)
(off his look)

Sorry Its just Its been so
unfair for her She was so much worse
when it all started I couldnt even
get her out of bed She kind of just
turned inside herself And couldnt
find her way out I was so scared
Weve been to every possible doctor on
the planet Therapists psychologists
psychiatrists and nothing They ran down
the list Depression Post traumatic
whatever Abandonment And then
after a while she got a little better
Responsive at least But she just
wouldnt talk

HENRY
Maybe she didnt have anything to say
She just wasnt ready until now

( )

DAWN
Maybe But she touched the--

HENRY
(interrupting)
You cant possibly be thinking that stain
made her talk again

DAWN
I didnt say that but that is what
happened She touched it she talked

HENRY
Dawn Im happy your daughter spoke but
it was a completely random event Things
like that dont happen in real life If
they did I wouldnt be--

Stops himself

DAWN
You wouldnt be what

Henry hesitates then

HENRY
Do you ever feel like things just happen
to you Like youre just kind of along
for some ride and theres nothing you can
do to steer whatever the hell it is
youre riding

DAWN

I feel like that all the time When my ex-
husband left it was like this
desperation I felt like

(searching)
You know that feeling when youre sitting
in a chair leaning back on the back
legs and you almost fall back but you
catch yourself at the last minute and
then your nerves are all sort of shot for
a while

Henry nods

DAWN (CONTD)

I pretty much feel that way all the time
Like I dont know if Im ever going to
feel safe again

With great hesitation Henry takes hold of Dawns hand She
smiles sadly

DAWN (CONTD)
Im sorry I called you a dick face the
other day
HENRY
Its OK
(pause)
I suddenly feel like I have to tell you
- something Just so Im not the only one
who knows
Dawn looks on concerned

Henry walks slowly amid the bustling throng of pedestrians
his face stoic eyes vacant Lost

He reaches an intersection crossing with the other people

Upon reaching the middle of the crosswalk Henry suddenly
stops a quiet devastation coming over him He looks as if he
might cry

The traffic light changes and Henry is left alone in the
crosswalk

Cars accelerate through the crosswalk passing Henry on
either side HORNS BLARE as he stands there frozen in time

Henry sits behind the wheel of his Mercedes alone driving
nowhere numb the car stereo blaring music

All of a sudden he recklessly cuts across three lanes of the
freeway and amid the screeching tires and blaring horns of
other cars comes to screeching halt on the shoulder under a
FREEWAY OVERPASS

He sits there feeling everything and nothing all at once an
anxiety brewing

INT EXT HENRY MERCEDESFREEWAY NIGHT

A good amount of time has passed The music still blares A
different song

Henry sits staring at the passing traffic Anonymous Unseen
by anyone On the passenger seat next to him lays a REVOLVER
sitting atop a brown paper bag JOSEPHS PAWN SHOP STENCILED
ACROSS IT

He reaches for the gun then stops himself afraid to touch
it A long painful moment then in one swift motion

-»HENRY GRABS THE GUN and trembling points it at his
temple

HE FIRES but misses completely

The bullet SHATTERS THE REAR WINDOW OF THE CAR as Henry falls
over clutching his ear

The DEAFENING RING OF TINNITUS OVERTAKES EVERYTHING as Henry
fights back anguished tears a trickle of blood dripping from
his ear

OUTSIDE the traffic moves on No one notices a thing

And slowly the TINNITUS RING BECOMES INTERMITTENT BLENDING
WITH THE RING OF A PHONE --

obliviously dumps a waste paper basket into his trash bin

get back to you as soon as possible

The voice mail beeps and long silence follows
EXT FREEWAY - NIGHT

Henry stands on the shoulder leaning against the trunk of
his car the shattered rear window behind him In the
distance he can see the DOWNTOWN SKYLINE

A streak of dried blood trails down his cheek staining his
face He holds a cell phone to his good ear A long pause as
he struggles against his overwhelming anguish

HENRY

(every word labored)
Um Its me Im just calling to let
you know Im Fine Um And I think
Im going away for a bit And you
shouldnt worry or Look for me And
Im sorry I love you but Im sorry

(pause)
Theres a reason but You shouldnt
worry-- I already said that And if you
could Just tell Lydia tell her I

you want

Henry flips the cell phone closed then suddenly tosses it out
onto the freeway where a PASSING CAR SPEEDS OVER IT SMASHING
IT TO BITS

Henry takes a seat at the couch placing a plate with a Hot
Pocket on the coffee table As he stares at the pathetic
piece of hot dough he suddenly notices

THROUGH THE FRONT WINDOW Esperanza making her way across
his lawn toward Dawns home

Henry darts to a SIDE WINDOW spying as Esperanza knocks on
Dawns door

Dawn emerges and the two women speak Esperanza makes the
sign of the cross

Avoiding Dawns gaze Henry darts back behind the curtain
then peeking again he sees Esperanza heading toward his
front door

Henry rushes to the door locking the dead-bolt He stands
back pressed to the door as heavy pounding echoes through the
house

ESPERANZA (0S)
Mr Poole Hello

He cringes at the sound of her voice More knocking followed
by the doorbell

ESPERANZA (0S) (CONTD)
Mr Poole are you home

After a moment of incessant ringing the doorbell stops
followed by footsteps fading away

Henry takes a deep breath eyes closed

ESPERANZA (0S) (CONTD)
Mr Poole are you OK

Henry gasps finding Esperanza planted in the kitchen
doorway

HENRY
Jesus Christ How did you get in here

ESPERANZA
Back door It was open

HENRY

That doesnt mean you can just walk
through it

( )

ESPERANZA

I need to talk to you

HENRY
No No you don’t I know exactly what
you want to say

ESPERANZA
You dont know exactly

Henry starts walking the perimeter of the room pulling open
all the curtains and opening the windows

HENRY
You think that little girl spoke last
night because she touched the wall And
now were all supposed to believe that
the second coming is happening in my
backyard And next thing you know this
whole Goddamn street -- sorry -- this
whole street turns into some kind of
carnival with every holy roller freak
within a hundred mile radius lining up
around my house to touch or catch a
glimpse of my shitty stucco job that has
somehow managed to seep its shittiness
into every crevice of my shitty life No
way is that happening and no way did
Millie touching that wall have anything
to do with her finally opening her
yapper And God only knows - and I use
the phrase loosely - what it was that
made her get out of bed at three in the
morning and start palming that wall like
her life depended on it

Esperanza a bit stunned at the diatribe sighs

ESPERANZA
It was me

HENRY
What was you

ESPERANZA
I told her the wall would take away her
suffering that it would make her feel
better if she just had faith

He approaches her

HENRY
Why would you do that

( )

ESPERANZA
It worked No

HENRY
No it didnt work She worked Maybe
your little insane pep talk set her on
her way but she got there on her own

ESPERANZA
Why is it so hard for you to believe
that something like this could happen

HENRY
Why is it so important to you that I
believe something like this could happen

Esperanza ponders the question stifled

Hurt and disheartened Esperanza sinks in her skin tears

ESPERANZA
Because--

HENRY
Because Ill tell you why Because if
you convince me then somehow suddenly
your beliefs become more real And the
more people you get to jump on board your
little train the more your mission is
made So until you get me to swallow your
world and believe exactly what you
believe youll never have the kind of
faith you want to have Youll always
have doubt Youll never be sure that
youre right And youll always be
staring at those pictures in your shrine
or whatever it is hoping for that man to
come waltzing back in from the dead

welling in her eyes as Henry immediately begins to regret his

tirade

The silence is over taken by a SHRILL SCREAM coming from the
backyard Startled Henry and Esperanza rush toward the back

door

testing her vision Henry remains baffled

He ponders an answer shaking his head then notices
Esperanza across the room phone in hand and dialing

He rips the phone from her hand

Youre not calling anyone Youre not
telling anyone about this This doesnt

Sort of Yeah

DAWN
You just left your life behind

‘Henry peers at Dawn Hearing it that way somehow makes it a
little more real

DAWN (CONTD)
And no one from that life knows youre
here Why didnt you tell anyone

Henry ponders the question then with a subtle feigned

certainty

(

HENRY
To spare them

Dawns gaze penetrates a tiny smirk surfaces The look
when someone knows you better than you do yourself

DAWN
To spare them or to spare yourself

His eyes meet hers She may have him on that one

DAWN (CONTD)
How could you do that

HENRY
What

DAWN
Do you have a mother Henry

He nods

DAWN (CONT’D)
You may not be a child anymore but
Shell always be a mother Shes probably
worried to death about you You know

Her logic catches him off guard as a hint of guilt surfaces
in his gaze

HENRY
Maybe But trust me staying would have
been worse

DAWN
How

HENRY
My mother She wouldnt have accepted
this thing happening to me Shed want to
control it Like everything

DAWN
And why do you Accept it

Henry shrugs not sure how to answer Almost as if hes never
even considered an alternative

HENRY
If I didnt Would it make it less
true Less real

It really wouldnt matter

Does anything matter Henry
Henry hesitates a delicate longing in his gaze

if you could come play with her

Henry peers at Dawn awkward uncomfortable

HENRY
Really I dont think thats such a good
idea You know I--

Are you actually even considering saying
no to an eight year old little girl who
just suddenly breached an epic bout of
being mute And now shes asking for

seemingly empty yard He takes a couple of steps farther into

the yard as he scans the perimeter

No answer

HENRY (CONTD)
(calling into the house)
I dont think shes out here

And as the words leave his mouth HENRY IS BEANED IN THE
HEAD WITH A WATER BALLOON

He stands there stunned and dripping wet as the sound of
Millies chuckling suddenly fills the yard

As he wipes the water from his face Millie emerges from
behind a bush two more water balloons in her hands and in
the throes of a giggle fit She laughs with abandon the way
only young children can

Dawn steps out through the back door a bucket of water
balloons in her grasp as Henry numbly struggles to allow
himself to surrender to the moment

And as Dawn tries to hand him a balloon Henry turns away
heading out of the yard His words shamefully creak out

HENRY (CONTD)
I cant
(to Millie)
Im sorry

Millies laughter dissipates as she and Dawn watch him leave
when all of a sudden

-Henry snags a nearby hose from the ground and in one swift
motion SPRAYS MILLIE WITH A STEADY BLAST OF WATER

HENRY (CONTD)
First rule of battle Never trust the
enemy

Millie erupts with laughter as she runs from the spray

A moment later Dawn unleashes her own attack launching one
water balloon after the other at Henry

And just like that theyre in the midst of GRAND WATER
BALLOON FIGHT

Henry succumbs to the joy of the moment and allows himself to
laugh and for one brief moment to forget his reality And
just PLAY

INT HENRY’S HOMEBEDROOM — DAY

The quiet stillness is broken by the SOUND OF THE FRONT DOOR
OPENING A moment later Henry enters the room still soaking
wet from the water balloon fight

Sitting on the edge of his bed it’s clear a subtle levity
has come over him The remnants of his unexpected playtime

Staring at the bedroom wall his gaze falls on the TINY PHOTO
he pinned to the wall earlier A moment passes And he
stands a calm reverie taking over as he leaves the room and
we finally see the photo in detail

Henry’s Young Mother his Father and Henry 9 years old
Everyone smiling A HAPPY FAMILY

EXT MIDDLE CLASS NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY

Henry wanders down the block away from his home his clothes
still damp

As he comes upon the CORNER HOUSE his childhood home his
gaze lingers as he passes A hint of longing

EXT MAIN BOULEVARD - DAY

Henry continues walking seemingly aimless Until something
catches his eye

A BUS thundering by and pulling up to a BUS STOP Henry
breaks into a jog rushing aboard the bus

INTEXT BUS - DAY

The BUS DRIVER oddly eyeballs this new passengers current
damp state as Henry digs out a couple of soggy dollars and
hands them over

As the bus pulls away Henry makes his way down the aisle
collecting more peculiar looks from the PASSENGERS until
finally he finds a seat

Settling in Henrys gaze drifts from passenger to passenger
He watches their interactions Their human contact

-- A MOTHER feeding her INFANT dabbing a bit of drool from
the baby’s mouth

-- A YOUNG COUPLE holding hands as the man mindlessly

caresses the palm of the womans hand tracing the creases
with his finger A loving touch

-- An OLD MAN sullenly working a crossword puzzle Sensing
Henry’s gaze he stops turning his head to look back at him
Henry holds his gaze A little too long Almost looking
through him

OLD MAN
Something wrong son

HENRY
(slowly sapping out of it)
Yes I mean Sorry No

Quelling his slight embarrassment Henry looks out the window
when suddenly something catches his eye He quickly reaches
up pulling the stop cord

EXT CITY BRIDGE - DAY

The bus pulls away leaving standing in the middle of the
desolate bridge where it becomes clear he is standing over a
portion of the VAST CONCRETE LA RIVER

Henry makes his way to the end of the bridge finding a way
into onto the river bed through a rusty gate

EXT LA RIVERBED - DAY

Henry makes his way along the river bank walking under the
bridge where he begins examining the huge concrete support
pylons It takes a moment but he finally finds what he was
looking for

Scrawled among he the thick layers of graffiti in small
faded letters Four words HENRY POOLE WAS HERE

He eyes the words nostalgia seeping in as he gently passes
his fingers over the concrete

A FEW MOMENTS LATER

Henry stands serenely down in the middle of the dry riverbed
his feet planted on the edge of the narrow runoff canal

He watches the strange sight of a LITTLE DUCK floating along
with the current of the murky water

He looks to the endless right miles and miles of pale white
concrete And then to the endless left More of the same
And in the distance the DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES SKYLINE
clearly just minutes away

And it’s hard not to notice how small he looks in this vast
space

EXT BUS STOP - NIGHT

A bus pulls up the doors open and Henry emerges He’s tired
but somehow content

INT DAWN STUPEKS HOUSE NIGHT

Dawn lays curled up on the couch watching a late night talk
show THE SOUND OF A SNEEZE coming from outside brings her to
her feet She moves TO THE WINDOW where she spies Henry
stepping up his walkway

Perhaps sensing her stare Henry stops for a moment and looks
toward Dawns window as she shrinks back behind her curtains
Seeing nothing he walks into his house

INT HENRY’S HOMEBEDROOM -— NIGHT

Henry lays in bed on his back In one hand he holds a
flashlight shining it at the open closet facing the foot of
the bed In the other hand he fiddles with aSharpie marker

And there on the wall inside the closet before him scrawled
in sharpie the words HENRY POOLE WAS HERE

INT HENRYS HOMELIVING ROOM - MORNING

Henry lays on the couch his fingers nervously tapping Dawns
empty cookie plate sitting on his chest

All of a sudden he hears the sound of Millie and Dawn coming
from outside Their voices Their front door closing

He bolts up clutching the plate and rushes to the door He
hesitates frustrated unsure but mostly just nervous

After a few more quick false starts he finally makes it
through the front door

EXT HENRYS HOME - DAY

Plate still in hand Henry catches up with Dawn and Millie as
they reach Dawns car open and open the passenger side door

HENRY

Millie climbs into the car closes the door and drapes
herself through the open window

She climbs in starts the car and drives away

As Henry watches ANOTHER CAR approaches slowing down as it
reaches Henrys home

INSIDE TWO MIDDLE AGED WOMEN peer out fixating on Henrys
house The car slows toa crawl as Henry walking back home
notices

A the Iwo Women catch sight of him the car picks up speed
and drives away Henry looks on quizzically

INT SUPERMARKET - NIGHT

Henry cruises down an aisle basket in hand and a little
bounce to his step

He tosses in a pack of razors and shaving cream to go with
the deodorant floss and shampoo already inside the basket

At the end of the aisle Patience stands leaning on an end
display happily watching Henry do his shopping Shes
looking vibrant with a new hair-do

PATIENCE
Hey Mr Poole

HENRY
Oh Hey

PATIENCE
(smirking)

HENRY

HENRY

Henry steps away heading down the aisle

Henry and Esperanza stand before the open sliding glass door
watching her friends

dosie the other two older women and an ELDERLY GENTLEMAN
lined up reverently before the stain Each one carries a
votive candle or flowers

And Millie happily scurrying to and from the wall
collecting the offerings from each person and placing them
reverently beneath the stain

ESPERANZA

the other day

He looks at her confused

ESPERANZA (CONTD)
When you were yelling at me

HENRY
Oh right Listen Im sorry about--

ESPERANZA
Dont apologize I heard you Thats all

Henry quietly accepts the apology as They watch Josie step up
to the wall then solemnly place the palm of her hand on the
stain She genuflects and makes the sign of the cross

HENRY
Whats wrong with her

ESPERANZA
Bursitis

The next little old lady steps up

HENRY
What about her

ESPERANZA
Acid reflux

HENRY
And the one behind her

ESPERANZA
Theres nothing wrong with her

HENRY
So Preventative

Esperanza shrugs and nods

ESPERANZA
It cant hurt no
(pause)
What about you Have you touched the wall

( )

Henry takes a moment contemplating the question as his gaze
falls on Millie He smiles a hint of awe at her simple joy
as she looks back him returning the smile

HENRY
Not yet

She looks at him with an affirmative gaze

ESPERANZA
But you will

Henry remains quiet Just then they both notice another
LITTLE OLD MAN cautiously entering his backyard a small
portrait of Jesus in his hands

HENRY
Whats this

ESPERANZA
Dont worry Its just this once Like

As Esperanza steps away to greet the Old Man she peers over

EXT HENRYS HOMEBACKYARD - NIGHT

Henry leads Dawn into the yard where she discovers

two lawn chairs and a little card table adorned with a
candle two place settings and bottle of wine all set up in
the center of the yard

She smiles

EXT HENRYS HOMEBACKYARD - LATER

With the pizza half gone Dawn and Henry sit at the little
card table A quiet moment passes as Dawn musters a question

DAWN
Can I ask you something The other
night I heard you come home late and--
(stops herself)
You know what Im sorry Its none of
my business I shouldnt have-

HENRY

Its OK I was just coming back from a
walk Sort of Its funny when I
left I dont think I really knew where
I was going Until I got there

DAWN
Where did you go

HENRY

A place I used to go when I was a kid
When I realized my parents hated each
other The riverbed It used to make me
feel so small It was so vast I
wanted the rain to come and wash me away
But I felt safe there Hidden and safe
A refuge

(pause)
Thats why I came back here

DAWN
To feel safe

HENRY
To hide

(pause)
I had two choices
(MORE)
( )

HENRY (CONTD)

I could have made a list of all the
things Ive never done and started
booking sky diving lessons and bungee
jumping trips But those are all things
you kind of want to remember And what
good are memories if youre not around to
have them So I chose the other way

DAWN
Just like that You disappeared

Henry shrugs a little embarrassed

DAWN (CONTD)
We all have our ways of not paying
attention to our lives The bad parts
and the good

Henry takes a deep breath he knows shes talking about
herself too Then working up his resolve

‘HENRY
You know Im sorry but can we talk
about something else Because
(struggling to admit it)
Im kind of enjoying this Enjoying
you And I didnt expect to feel this
Ever

She smiles warmly She feels the same

Dawn immediately gets up walking toward the source of her
daughters voice The fence

DAWN

Dawn turns back toward Henry as she starts to head out of the
backyard

DAWN (CONTD)
Ill be right back But do me a favor
Keep enjoying this

Henry watches her leave then slowly shifts his gaze to the
wall the stain A subtle melancholy falls over him as he
recalls his plight

He gets up approaching the wall his eyes fixed on the blood
coming from the eye as it slowly trickles down

INT DAWN STUPEKS HOUSEMILLIES BEDROOM - NIGHT

Dawn finishes tucking Millie back into bed and gives her a
peck on the cheek as Millie rolls over snuggling up under
the covers

DAWN
Go to sleep sweetie

And as Dawn heads out of the room Millies eyes pop open
EXT HENRYS HOMEBACKYARD - NIGHT

Henry approaches the wall now

Only a couple of feet away he stops Then somehow quelling
his doubt he reaches out extending his arm ready to touch

the stain

His fingers tremble just a bit as they approach an inch
away now A little closer And closer Until

DAWN (0S)
‘Sorry about that

Henrys arm snaps down as he turns to find Dawn entering the
backyard He stifles his embarrassment as reality comes
rushing over him What could he have been thinking

DAWN (CONTD)
-its like she doesnt want to miss a
thing now that--

And suddenly Dawn realizes what Henry was about to do

HENRY

You know Maybe we should call it a
night This isnt--

DAWN
Henry--
She walks to him
HENRY
Im suddenly realizing how dangerous all
this is
DAWN

What are you talking about
Face to face now

HENRY
This You and me Hope

DAWN
How can you think that I can almost see
the other side because of this Henry
I dont care that youre going to die

Henry looks down unable hold her gaze as Dawn slowly reaches
for both his hands Its almost magnetic as Henry allows
her to take hold

DAWN (CONTD)
We should pay attention To right now

He looks up again his eyes penetrating hers
HENRY
I am paying attention Thats the
problem
And with that he gently pulls his hands away

-then steps into his house quietly closing the door behind
him and leaving Dawn just a little heart broken

INT HENRYS HOMEBEDROOM - NIGHT

Henry lays in bed on his back fully clothed He stares at the
gaping hole left in the drywall by the churchs research
team Hes immobile until finally he slowly sits up

EXT HENRYS HOMEBACKYARD — NIGHT

Henry stands in the middle of the yard his gaze fixed on the

stain His eyes seeking something Anything Until
finally his eyes close

( )

And then in a silent whisper his lips quivering He
utters his private prayer

And its the tears which force his eyes open And Henry
weeps quietly for the first time Releasing

EXT SUBURBAN NEIGHBORHOOD — DAWN

High above Floating in the crisp morning light we survey the
serene neighborhood slowly swooping over the simple track
housing and coming upon Henrys home Over the roof and
into

HENRYS BACKYARD

--where Henry lays asleep on the ground amid the votive
candles and flower offerings beneath the stain Hes been
there all night inches from the wall

Still slumbering Henry does not he hear the FAINT BUZZ OF A
FLY as it LANDS ON HIS CHIN and crawls down onto his neck

A moment later however he unexpectedly swats it
splattering the bug on his skin Pulling his hand away he
stares at his palm A TINY SPOT OF BLOOD IN THE CENTER
INT GALLATIN MEDICAL CENTERLABORATORY -— MORNING

White everywhere Until a DROP OF BLOOD splatters filling
most of the screen Another follows as we reveal

A LAB TECHNICIAN hunched over a high-powered electronic
microscope

His head pops up a perplexed look on his face He goes down
to the eye-piece once again

INT GALLATIN MEDICAL CENTERWAITING ROOM - MORNING

Esperanza sits quietly in the empty florescently lit room
She watches the clock on the wall across from her 8AM

The lab door pops open followed by the Lab Tech stepping

She finds Father Salazar behind his desk on the Phone and
now perturbed at her barging in

conversation

FATHER SALAZAR

Father Salazar tosses the file on the desk shaking his head
at a loss

INT HENRYS HOMEBATHROOM - MORNING
Henry in the midst of a shower lets the water stream hit
his face for an inordinate amount of time You would almost
think he was trying to drown himself

He reaches down to the faucets grabbing hold of the cold
water and slowly turning it off

Steam pours over the bathroom as Henry lets the scalding
water pound his chest He winces from the pain letting the
water burn seeing how much he can take

INT HENRYS HOMEBEDROOM - DAY

CLOSE ON the small Poole family photo taped to the wall as
Henry peels it off

He eyes it for a moment a stoic stare then crumples it in
his fist A moment later A FRANTIC KNOCKING interrupts the

Henry rushes to the door and opens it to find Dawn trying
desperately to contain her panic

INT DAWN STUPEKS HOUSEMILLIES BEDROOM - MORNING

Henry stands in the doorway his breath labored hesitant to
go any further Dawn stands behind him

DAWN
Shes been like that all morning

Millie lays on the bed curled up her eyes open but utterly
vacant Just a blank stare glazed on her face

DAWN (CONTD)
She wont talk to me She wont look at
me Nothing She hasnt even moved

Henry musters the courage to step into the room He kneels
down beside her bed his face inches from hers

HENRY
Millie Can you hear me Come on now I
know you can hear me Millie Whats
wrong

No reaction from Millie

HENRY (CONTD)
Look at me sweetie Remember how much
fun we had the other day Remember how we
played Dont make me drag that hose in
here

Still nothing from Millie Just her vacant eyes Its
disarming

Henry looks away down at the floor where his gaze falls
‘upon MILLIES LITTLE TAPE RECORDER

-peeking out from under the bed Suddenly realizing
something Henry picks it up and peers over his shoulder at
Dawn with a deep unsettled gaze

INT DAWN STUPEKS HOUSEHALLWAY - MORNING

Henry and Dawn stand outside Millies bedroom as he hits the
play button on the recorder And the words from the
previous night spill out

A quiet devastation washes over both of them as they look
through the open door at Millies immobile little face

Will you drive us to the doctor

Speechless himself he just nods

Henry emerges from the building with Millie cradled in his
arms his face ashen Dawn follows close behind tears
streaking her cheeks

PEDIATRICIAN (V0)

That said elective mutism is one thing
But like we talked about the last time
if this is catatonia or something like
it thats another Episodes like this
are pretty uncommon in young children
Many cases are reflective of mood
disorders In adults they can last an
hour a day a week But if she doesnt
Snap out of it by tomorrow We might
need to admit her to the hospital

INTEXT HENRYS CAR - DAY

Henry drives with Dawn in the back seat holding her baby
girl in her arms

A long painful silence as he peers in the rearview mirror
his gaze drifting from the catatonic Millie to Dawns
helpless eyes

At first the only sound is the wind whipping against a
loosened corner of the plastic garbage bag covering the rear
window shattered by Henrys suicide attempt

Henrys troubled eyes fix on the flapping plastic as the
steady HUM OF TINNITUS TAKES OVER

Until finally Henry speaks oddly numb His words directed
at no one

HENRY
Its my fault

DAWN
What

HENRY

Iwas expendable Until this I could
have just stopped living and no one would
have noticed But now Now Ill die and
shes the one left behind Shes the
one who has to remember

Staring at the back of Henrys head Dawn struggles to find a
response But none comes

HENRYS POV HIS STREET

»-as he drives turning onto his block and discovering every
parking space taken up by unfamiliar cars

He curiously scans the street until finally his gaze falls
on his own home strange cars lining the driveway as well

Among them a NEWS VAN with a CAMERAMAN and REPORTER preparing
to shoot

A instant later he spots Esperanza standing by the gate
leading to the backyard In her grasp a small church
collection plate being filled by the line of at least FIFTEEN
PEOPLE all filtering in through the gate

EXT HENRYS HOMEFRONT YARD - DAY

Esperanza spots Henrys car as it screeches to a stop in the
middle of the street Henry pops out dismayed and angry

HENRY
What the hell is this

As he furiously marches toward the gate Esperanza darts away
from the line up and attempts to intercept

ESPERANZA
Mr Poole please I can explain

HENRY
Get out of my way Esperanza I told you
one time That was it You promised

Esperanza back peddles shuffling from side to side trying
to slow him down

ESPERANZA
God is bigger than a promise Mr Poole
Please just listen to me

Growing desperate she drops the collection plate and
unexpectedly plants her hands on Henrys chest

Henry is stunned by her touch He was not expecting her to
get physical She grabs him by the shoulders

ESPERANZA (CONTD)
Mr Poole please Just let me talk to
you

BACK AT THE GATE Father Salazar appears His expression
drops shocked at the brewing scene across the front yard

FATHER SALAZAR
Esperanza Stop that

Father Salazar rushes over peeling Esperanza off of Henry
FATHER SALAZAR (CONTD)
Let him go Im sorry Mr Poole
Please just let us --

Ignoring Salazar Henry bolts across the yard through the
bottleneck of people and into

THE BACKYARD

He stands there fuming as he surveys the yard in full and
discovers

--at least FORTY PEOPLE all reverently scattered about
Some taking snapshots others rolling home video

At the base of the wall he finds a massive collection of
votive candles bouquets of flowers hand drawn posters
statues and small portraits of Jesus —

Esperanza and Father Salazar rush into the backyard The News
Crew follows as well the TV camera trained on Henry

HENRY
Holy shit

ESPERANZA
No holy shit Holy something else Mr
Poole the test came back and--

HENRY
And what You found theres no
explanation Big surprise

ESPERANZA

No Mr Poole--

FATHER SALAZAR
(interrupting)
Yes youre right there is no
explanation Thats exactly right

HENRY
So whats going on here What are all
these people doing here

FATHER SALAZAR
Theyre here to see something
unexplainable Theyre here to find some
hope

Henry leers at Father Salazar
HENRY
You know what I was wrong to let this
happen the first time This is absurd
Look at them Theyre praying to my wall

One of the FEMALE WORSHIPERS steps up to Henry She speaks

into his left ear

FEMALE WORSHIPER
Excuse me Is this your house

Frustrated Henry gently grabs her shoulders and moves her to
his right side The woman stares quizzically at Henry

HENRY
Dont ask What did you say

FEMALE WORSHIPER
Is this your house

HENRY
Yeah This is my house

FEMALE WORSHIPER
You know youre a very lucky man to
have this blessing on you

HENRY
Yeah I should buy a lottery ticket

FEMALE WORSHIPER
Thats my son over there

She points to a TEENAGE BOY 19 years old clearly missing
copious amounts of hair from under the bandana wrapped around
his head The boy stands by the wall with his FATHER his
hand firmly pressed on the stain

FEMALE WORSHIPER (CONTD)
Leukemia

HENRY
(appalled)
And you brought him here

FEMALE WORSHIPER
We heard about what the image has done so
far and we believe Its all we have
left Just a little hope
Henry simmers slowly becoming more and more agitated

HENRY
Hope You think this going to help him

Father Salazar lightly grabs Henrys arm sensing the verbal
deluge about to spill from his mouth

FATHER SALAZAR
Mr Poole dont --

( )

HENRY

(pulling his arm away)
No These people These people
Theyre making this kid believe his life
is going to last longer than it is
because theres a stain on some
strangers wall Hope isnt going to help
him

(pointing to various people)
Or him or him or her Am I the only one
getting this This is wrong Hope
Cant save you

The Teenage Boy confused tired looks at Henry as he winds
down from his outburst The boy and Henry lock eyes for a
moment until

Henry snaps out of it bolting from the backyard

and keeping her distance follows

Esperanza sees him coming and instinctively moves toward him
trying to block his way walking backward in stride

( )

ESPERANZA
Mr Poole what are you doing

EXT HENRYS HOMEBACKYARD - DAY

He charges in determined and with Esperanza still trying to
block his path

ESPERANZA
You cant Please Mr Poole This is a
gift from God You cant do this

Henry marches on ignoring her as Dawn and Millie cautiously
enter

ESPERANZA (CONTD)
Please just listen to me Please Henry
Please This is a gift a miracle Dont
do this It will be a sin

Henry shoves her out of the way reaches the wall and kicks
the candles statues and portraits out of the way

Esperanza is stunned into silence by his rage

HENRY
I dont care what it is And I can do
whatever I want I didnt ask for this
and I dont want it This is my decision
This is what I want I want these
trinkets off my lawn I want these people
out of my yard I want this stain off my
wall And I just want to I want

A dark pensive moment as his world caves in on him

And with that Henry takes his first swing PLUMMETING THE
AXE INTO THE CENTER OF THE STAIN

HENRY (CONTD)
This does not save lives

The group of people gasp shocked almost horrified
HENRY (CONTD)
(another swing)
This does not heal anything

Swing after swing Henry continues to bury the axe
ferociously into the wall destroying his own home

Chunks of stucco fall to the ground as he hammers the axe
over and over

The hits dig into the frame of the house splintering a
number of the two by fours

Dawn looks on stunned

DAWN
Henry

Oblivious to her calls he continues the destruction
chopping away at the support beams

Breathless tired his pace slows as

ALL SOUNDS FADE AWAY REPLACED BY THE RINGING DIN OF HIS
TINNITUS

Only a small piece of the stain remains
THE RIGHT EYE a trickle of blood still flowing

A misstep amid the pile of rubble causes Henry to lose his
balance

He plants his hand on the remaining wall his thumb touching
the edge of the eye steadying himself while stepping under
the overhanging roof

Without warning the RINGING IN HIS EAR FADES AWAY All sound
returns his hearing clear as a bell

Jerking his hand away from the wall Henry shakes his head
bewildered shocked

He touches his right ear snapping his fingers testing his
hearing A long moment then

DAWN (CONTD)
Henry

He turns focusing on Dawn and Millie amid the group of
people all glaring in disbelief at what he has done

Esperanza suddenly steps into his line of sight --
ESPERANZA
Mr Poole The test came back The
blood on the wall Is real

Henrys face turns ashen at the revelation a subtle
dumbfounded regret creeping in

HENRY
What

( )

And then all off a sudden a sharp creak from the house
prefaces

«eTHE ROOF COLLAPSING ON TOP OF HENRY

DAWN
Henry

People gasp as Henry is BURIED BY THE RUBBLE OF HIS OWN HOME
Father Salazar bolts from the crowd toward the toppled house

FADE TO BLACK

INT HOSPITAL ROOM — DAY
An IV unit drips its fluid into the plastic tubing
Henry lays in bed his arm in a cast and a bandage on his
forehead covering up a few stitches He slowly comes awake
disoriented yet discovering
-Esperanza sitting at the foot of the bed in vigil
HENRY
(rolling his eyes)
Oh God

ESPERANZA
Mr Poole You are OK Thank God

HENRY
What are you doing here

ESPERANZA
Making sure you are OK

Resigned to her presence Henry sits up with a pained moan
HENRY
Correct me if Im wrong My house fell
on top of me right

ESPERANZA
Yes youre not wrong

She hands him a newspaper carrying a set of before and after
pictures of his home with an accompanying story

The headline reads KNOCK KNOCKWHOS THERE JESUS

( )

HENRY
(shaking his head)
How did I get out

ESPERANZA
Mostly Father Salazar But everyone
helped
(pause)
Eventually

Henry grimaces at the thought as Esperanza looks him over a
proud little smile creeping onto he face

HENRY

What are you smiling at
ESPERANZA

At you
HENRY

Yeah I can see how this is hilarious
ESPERANZA

Why did you not tell me Mr Poole
HENRY

What
ESPERANZA

About the sickness you had Dawn told us

HENRY
Because Its not really something--
Wait What do you mean had

Esperanza quietly overjoyed takes his hand

ESPERANZA
Its a miracle Mr Poole They did some
tests With your blood I think Whatever
you had You dont have anymore

Pulling his hand away Henry sits up further wincing in pain
and growing agitated Hes not buying a word of this

HENRY
What are you talking about

ESPERANZA

You should not move Mr Poole You are
still weak

HENRY
I want to talk to the doctor

Groaning he slides his legs off the bed

HENRY (CONTD)
I want to talk to the doctor right now

ESPERANZA
Please Mr Poole Ill go get him
Ill ‘go

Esperanza rushes out of the room leaving Henry dismayed He
sits still for a moment but his impatience wins out as he
lurches to his feet

Grabbing his IV post and rolling along he heads for the
door stumbling dizzy

INT HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - DAY
Henry staggers out of his room

HENRY
I want to see the doctor

Peering down the hall his gaze falls on Esperanza talking to
a YOUNG DOCTOR

They immediately catch sight of Henry and rush toward him

YOUNG DOCTOR
Mr Poole please get back into your
room You should not be walking around

Henry struggles against the Doctors grasp as he grows
increasingly agitated

HENRY
Tell me what happened Im dying Im
supposed to be dying

YOUNG DOCTOR

You need to get back in your bed right
now

(to the nursing staff)
Can I get some help over here Mr Poole
you need to calm down and listen to me

(noticing Henrys arm)
Look at your arm Youre bleeding

(

HENRY
(breaking free from the
Doctors grasp)
What
The doctor points to Henrys arm where the IV needle has
slipped out A trickle of blood drips down his forearm down
through the palm of his hand and to the tip of his finger

Henry starting to lose his balance getting woozy Locks
eyes with the Young Doctor

HENRY (CONTD)
Im supposed to be dying

And now we follow the DRIP OF BLOOD as it leaves his finger
tip and splatters onto the floor

In the same instant Henry begins to collapses as

the screen is ENVELOPED IN RED and we flash to a SERIES OF
IMAGES

-ALL PLAYING BACKWARDS

at the lifeless patient

Dr Fancher looks up a troubled realization coming over him

DR FANCHER
Oh shit I have to make a phone call

Dr Fancher hurries out as the Orderly PULLS THE WHITE SHEET
OVER THE BODY and weFADE TO WHITE And were BACK TO

INT HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - SECONDS LATER

The ugly glow of florescent light slowly comes into focus as
Henry still on the floor flat on his back begins to
awaken

Through the haze of his semi-conscious state its hard to be
sure but it seems like hes hearing MILLIES LITTLE VOICE
Dream-like A swirl of sound Fading in and out

MILLIE (V0O)
Mr Poole Wake up Mr Poole Its
OK Its OK Wake up

His eyes finally flutter open and the first thing he sees is
the Young Doctor

YOUNG DOCTOR
Dont move Mr Poole

And then he notices off to the side Millie looking
slightly anxious but alert and well Its a welcome sight as
he whispers her name with a sigh of relief

HENRY
Millie
(pause)
Youre OK

Millies deep concern transforms into little grin as she
slowly cautiously steps to him kneeling down

( )

MILLIE
Mommy said youre not sick anymore

HENRY
Im not dying

His reverie is broken as Henry grimaces through the pain of
being lifted onto a gurney by TWO ORDERLIES

DAWN (0S)
No Henry Youre not

Its then he finally spots Dawn standing nearby recovering
from the fright of seeing Henry go down and infused with joy
at being able to give him the news

Henry stares with a doubtful confused smile

HENRY
How can that be

As they roll him back into
THE HOSPITAL ROOM
Dawn Esperanza Millie and the Young Doctor follow

DAWN
I told them what was wrong with you
And they checked And youre fine

The Orderlies slide Henry back onto the bed as a NURSE
attends to his IVv

HENRY
Youre telling me Im cured

Dawn exchanges a cautious glance with the Young Doctor

DAWN
Sort of

Henry looks on not understanding as Dawn steps to the bed
taking his hand

DAWN (CONTD)
Your other doctor Hes been looking
for you since you left And when the lab
inputted your information and the
insurance got involved --

(stops herself gets to the

point)
Anyway They found you

(MORE )

( )

DAWN (CONTD)

(pause)
You were never sick Henry

MILLIE
They mixed up your blood with someone
elses

Henry takes a moment his confusion melting away into quiet
shock

ESPERANZA
Im sorry Mr Poole I know how much
you like to be miserable

HENRY
So I was never going to die

ESPERANZA
Were all going to die Just not right
now for you And for you that is the
miracle

Speechless Henry tries to process the news as Millie steps
closer a grin on her face

MILLIE
© Im glad youre better Mr Poole

HENRY
Im glad youre better too

Henry looks peacefully at Millie It really is a pleasure to
see her smile and hear her speak His gaze drifts up to Dawn

HENRY (CONT’D)
You smile just like your mom

Esperanza once again eyes him with a big grin

HENRY (CONTD)
What

ESPERANZA
You know
(gently placing a hand on
Millies head)
You could just start with the idea that
miracles are possible

Henry tries to remain stoic but something in his gaze says
hes considering it

( )

Dawn leads

HENRY
Yeah well The miracles gone now
Just a pile of rubble

ESPERANZA
Dont worry about that too much It was
here for as long as it was meant to be
Like everything And everyone

HENRY
So the walls work is done

Dawn gently brushes the hair from Henrys forehead

DAWN
Thats a good way to look at it

MILLIE
But where will all the people go the
ones who came to see

ESPERANZA
People will always find other miracles
little one It will take more than a
crazy man with an ax to destroy hope

DAWN
You should get some rest Henry

YOUNG DOCTOR
Youll be out of here in a couple of days
as long as you stop roaming the halls

Millie toward the door Esperanza and the Young

Doctor follow

DAWN
Well be out here if you need us

And as they step out Esperanza quickly shuffles back to
Henrys bedside reaches into her purse and pulls out a foil
wrapped tamale She places it on the night stand

And as she

ESPERANZA
A tamale For later Food is terrible
here
scurries back toward the door --

HENRY
Wait

She stops turns to face him as Henry hesitates struggling
with a question

HENRY (CONTD)
Why do you care so much

She answers as if it had never occurred to her there could be
another way

ESPERANZA
Because we should

And she walks out leaving Henry reflecting on her insight a
little smile making its way onto his face Its like no one
has ever said anything as nice to him

A little smile creeps onto his face as his eyes fall on the

HOME MR POOLE

INTEXT HENRYS HOMEBEDROOM - DAY

Henry stands at the edge of the rubble surveying his
fractured home the wall to the bedroom demolished and
exposing the house to the BACKYARD

He stares a bit dismayed until

»Dawn peers over the fence from her own yard

DAWN
Youre home

HENRY
(a big smile)
Whats left of it yeah

He walks over to the fence stepping up onto a cinder block
Theyre eye to eye now

DAWN
Are you going back To Chicago

HENRY
Probably

Dawn looks away Not exactly the answer she wanted

HENRY (CONTD)
For a visit I have a little explaining
to do And Ill probably have to talk my
mother out of suing our doctor

Dawn smiles still looking away She knows hes staying

Henry looks past her at the treadmill on her patio the
exhaust hose removed and laundry draped all over it

HENRY (CONTD)

Aside from the dryer giving out I just
sort of decided Im done running for now

DAWN (CONTD)
Pretty miraculous dont you think

HENRY
Human error People make mistakes

Dawn unexpectedly leans in close her lips right beside
HENRYS ONCE BAD EAR

DAWN
(whispering)
I dont think any of this was a mistake

Henry pulls back just enough to see her beautiful bright
face

An awkward moment as they both realize how physically close
they are to each other

DAWN (CONTD)
So what now

Henry thinks about it for a moment

HENRY
Now I do this

then leans over the fence giving Dawn a gentle kiss on
the lips

HENRY (CONTD)

She smiles impressed happy as we CUT TO
