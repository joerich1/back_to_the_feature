INT SUBWAY CAR -- NIGHT

CLOSE ON two eyes closed A YOUNG MAN sitting up
asleep

A noise like a slapping not loud Repeated again
again

The eyes blink open Unsure where we are They look
around

We pull back The young man wears a jacket and tie He
sits on a bench in a subway the car moving fast through
darkness

We pull back further The car is empty just the young
man

Bang the noise suddenly is louder It seems to come from
the next car down Now it goes back to the quiet slapping

The young man looks at the door to the next car He can’t
see anything The train rattles as it takes a curve

The young man gets up from the bench and takes his
briefcase He walks toward the next car his attention on
the door

ZARUMMMMM HE SLIPS ON THE FLOOR AND FALLS ON HIS BACK

His head slams down hard and he just lays there decked
But his hands feel moist his body feels wet like he
slipped in a puddle He holds both hands up above his head
THEY’RE COVERED IN BLOOD

BLOOD POURS DOWN HIS COAT SLEEVE MORE BLOOD ON HIS FACE
We pull back The young man lies in a huge lake of blood

He pulls himself up from the floor and we see that he is
soaked in blood like he’s had a bath in it He shivers

The next shock A blood pool at the door to the next car

The young man approaches the door carefully almost sliding
a second time He moves more slowly creeping up to the
door

The window of the door is covered in blood The young man
cannot see through it He has to get closer right up to
it
His eyes move next to the glass which reflects red on him
POV through the window We see a huge dark figure holding
an immense mallet The figure brings the mallet down
again and again and again repeatedly pounding blood
hitting the glass in splashes

The young man backs away He looks around Outside the
train pitch black No one else is around He looks
behind him The car on the other side is dark empty no
one there

Now the young looks back at the window The glass is
black

But there is something there --
A HUGE EYE staring straight back at us
IT’S THE DARK FIGURE LOOKING STRAIGHT AT US

The young man is horrified his expression total terror

EXT SUBWAY TRAIN -- CONTINUOUS

CLOSE ON subway windows as they fly past We stay close
enough to see what looks like sides of meat hanging inside

AND A DARK FIGURE IS DRAGGING SOMEONE THROUGH THE SUBWAY
CAR

EXT CITY STREET -- DAY

IN SLOW MOTION a young man walks down a sidewalk and as
he walks he lifts a camera He stops and turns toward us
He aims directly at the camera and shoots LEON KAUFMAN

late 20’s hair unruly face unshaven eyes piercing dark

We leave slow motion Leon shoikots more shots of the
street

INT LEON’S APARTMENT - DAY

Mounted on a wall a series of black and white stills

-- Busy street cab stopped at a curb MAN IN A SUIT hand
out like a tackler steals a cab by shoving another man

-- A HOMELESS campfire under an underpass A disheveled
homeless man comes at us with a bottle in hand

-- A POLICE CAR pulled over by a sidewalk TWO COPS
leaning over a guy in a leather jacket hands behind him

-- A shot of a breathtaking GIRL 20s dark hair hands on
hips smiling sexily in a park looking at us

We pull back to reveal --

The same girl MAYA JONES is reading a textbook at a
kitchen table She’s sexy in old pajamas and is wearing
reading glasses Smart as she is sexy street smart not
just book smart

Leaning over the shot is LEON KAUFMAN Late 20’s his hair
a mop of unruly curls face unshaven eyes piercing and
dark He is at the kitchen sink the counter top filled
with darkroom equipment Leon looks at Maya then at the
photo of her in the park

LEON
The chick in the photo’s hotter

Maya gives him a grin and a finger He comes over Maya
goes in for a kiss - it’s a combination of passion and
familiarity

LEON
Mmm You taste good

He comes back for a second kiss and a third

LEON
What are you reading

Maya tilts her head toward the textbook

MAYA
Metropolitan History

LEON
Learn anything interesting

MAYA
This was never a good place to
walk at night

LEON
It’s not a good place to drive
against traffic either Some
cabbie from one of those former
Soviet republics took a shortcut
on a one-way street Six car pile-
up
MAYA
(excited)
And you caught it

LEON
Right place right time

MAYA
How much did the Post give you

LEON
We made the rent

MAYA
That’s great Leon

LEON
That buys me a couple days to
work on my own stuff

Leon gets up and goes into the kitchen He opens the
refrigerator Bottles clatter as he looks for a beer

We get a good look at the apartment Total disarray
crammed with funky furniture and art pieces Even a
kitchen counter piled with camera equipment and stacks
test prints

MAYA
Things’1ll be easier once I get my
Master’s

LEON

I hate to break it to you Maya
but history teachers don’t
exactly rake it in

MAYA
Hey

Beer in hand Leon closes the refrigerator

LEON
Besides it’s not just the money

MAYA
I know baby You want to be
appreciated for your art

Leon knows she’s teasing him

LEON
Is that too much to ask

of
MAYA
No I know you’ll get there
Might take a few more years

Leon heads over to a cupboard and pulls down a bag of
chips

LEON
I don’t know if I’ve got that
much patience left

MAYA
Don’t worry everything happens
as it’s meant to be

Leon frowns Maya looks up at the photo of her in the
park

MAYA
You know what you need A genius
girlfriend who knows how to
network and get your work seen by
some classy gallery owner Like
say Susan Hoff

Maya grins She’s been saving this

LEON
What You didn’t How did you do
that

MAYA

Jurgis is a friend of hers He
met her through the magazine
You’re supposed to meet him at
her gallery tonight after it
closes

LEON
And you held that back the whole
time I stood around feeling sorry
for myself

Maya nods hugely pleased with herself

LEON
Youre going to pay for that

Leon charges her with a roar They fall onto the couch
laughing
INT NEGATIVE SPACE GALLERY - ENTRANCE AREA -- NIGHT

The gallery is a converted warehouse its interior entrance
a long ramp with brick walls leading to the main gallery
space

Leon and Jurgis enter

JURGIS
(quietly)
Don’t mention Maya Susan likes
her artists available

Leon gives Jurgis a small smirk He’s not worried about it

INT ART GALLERY - CONTINUOUS

A bare minimal space with the harshest gray concrete
walls A receptionist’s counter faces the front Behind
that a low table with a few catalogues and art magazines
On the walls are paintings by Clive Barker

SUSAN HOFF (40s) approaches from the back of the gallery
She is beautiful razor sharp There is an edge to
everything she says

JURGIS
Susan this is Leon Kaufman

LEON
Pleased to meet you

Susan smiles and shakes Leons hand Hes nervous
SUSAN
I looked at your work There’s a

consistency to your images

LEON
Thank you

SUSAN
Talk to me about them

Leon glances at Jurgis for a moment

SUSAN
Sell yourself a little
LEON
When I lived in Atlanta I
thought this was the promised
land where everything was
possible Then I got here It
was crushing There aren’t
dreams here Just humanity Not
natural and not kind It pulls
you in It takes from you I
want to show the source of that
energy The “heart of the city”

SUSAN
(wryly)
The “heart of the city”
LEON
Exactly
SUSAN

Then you’re failing
Leon freezes She pauses long enough to let it sink in

SUSAN
Most of the time

Susan motions with a finger for Leon to follow She turns
to a nearby table where she flips through the images in
his portfolio In doing so she leans in close to Leon
brushing against him She pauses on one photo A MEAT
WORKER looks up angry and surprised as he dumps half of a
calf carcass into a city trash can

SUSAN
Now thisIt’s not there but
it’s closer He lookscaught
in the act You exposed
something

She gives him a look

SUSAN
Something dirty

She closes the book

SUSAN
But you need to get a lot
dirtier

LEON

Dirtier
She looks at Leon directly in the eyes

SUSAN
You’re searching for the “heart
of the city” Then you have to
get under the flesh That’s what
I mean by dirty Come back when
youve done that

Leon stands silent not sure what to say

INT NEGATIVE SPACE GALLERY - ENTRANCE -- MOMENTS LATER 7
Leon stands in the entrance hall still in a daze

LEON
Is that it

JURGIS
Hey you got two minutes with
Susan Hoff Know how many people
would suck off their uncles for
that

LEON
(to himself)
“Tm looking for the real heart
of the city” What does that shit
sound like

JURGIS
Like the kid who just stepped off
the bus
INT LEON’S BEDROOM - NIGHT 8

Leon sits up in bed Maya is curled up against him

LEON
You know sometimes I hate this
city

MAYA

Yeah and some times you love it

encouraging

LEON
No it’s not fucking encouraging
Maya

Leon

Leon

Leon
each

Leon

Maya

smacks his chest

MAYA
Why are you so upset

MAYA
Because you think she’s probably
right

LEON
I thought my stuff was good Now
I don’t know

MAYA
So you shoot something else

LEON
I’m not sure

MAYA
You know how crazy that sounds
Tell me you’re not afraid of
failing That’s not it right

looks at her She smiles

MAYA
Cmon what is it

LEON
It’s not failure I don’t know
Now I’m just not sure what I’m
looking for

MAYA
Youre with me I’11 help you
find it

meets her smile They kiss slowly and snake against
other beneath the sheets After a while Maya pauses

MAYA
Come on don’t tell me your dick
is sulking too

smirks

LEON
It does what it does

tickles Leon until he has to laugh

MAYA
Youre lucky I’ve got the early
shift at Otto’s tomorrow

Maya kisses him rolls over and closes her eyes Leon
stares vacantly at the ceiling

INT DARK SUBWAY CAR -- NIGHT 9

A dimly lit subway car moves through the darkness No one
is on board and there is no noise except the rumble of the
train speeding down the tracks The walls and all fixtures
of the car have a brushed metallic sheen and light from
the outside tunnels flashes the metal as the car rushes
along

Overhead straps hang from the ceiling and they move
slightly in rhythm with the train A flash of light
reveals more of the straps They’re not straps but sharp
metal hooks like hooks used to hang sides of beef The
train moves faster and the hooks dance slightly clanging
Now the light changes again and the hooks are hand straps
just swinging waving

INT LEON’S BEDROOM -- NIGHT 10

With a start Leon opens his eyes Sees where he is He
carefully untangles himself from Maya and slides out The
train images were a nightmare He shakes it off

EXT DESERTED STREET - NIGHT 11

Leon is on the prowl camera in hand He snaps a shot but
the street is empty Up ahead the entrance to the subway

INT PERSHING SQUARE SUBWAY - ENTRANCE - NIGHT 12

Leon digs in his bag looking for camera gear He pulls
out his Leica and sees what’s around Only a few people
He swings the Leica up and shoots a HOMELESS MAN plus two
other people walking behind him (MAHOGANY’S back and bag)

Then abruptly Leon hears a small scream

He rounds the corner and sees a HIP GIRL She’s surrounded
by THREE GANGBANGERS Two are heavyset and tattooed one
with a short scruffy beard The LEADER is wiry freak with
nervous energy He’s got a prison-style tear-drop tattoo
beneath his eye
LEADER
Gotta pay the toll first bitch

HIP GIRL
Leave me alone you asshole

With this the leader hood slams her against the wall and
grabs her throat with one hand He pushes her chin up

LEADER
Then you’re going to have to pay
on your knees

Leon watches from a distance

The girl is scared now She’s totally surrounded
Laughing the leader backs a few feet away from the girl

In that moment she turns and looks at Leon Her eyes meet
his for the first time Does she expect him to help

Leon pulls up his Leica and --

Snap The camera freezes her and the hoodlum locked
together in a primal urban stand-off

They look at Leon Snap Leon captures the Hoodlum’s
surprise and anger and the Girl’s fear and hope

LEADER
What the fuck are you doing

The Hoodlum is in his face

LEADER
Give me the camera

The Girl edges away from the gangbangers

Leon looks like he’s ready to slug the Hoodlum

even thinking about his camera which he lowers to his

He’s not

side If he could put the camera somewhere safe he’d hit
the guy
LEADER
I said give me the camera
The Leader steps forward and knocks Leon’s gear bag down

The

Leader waits for a reaction Leon holds his ground

Leon sees a surveillance camera above them He points up
the lens

at

LEON
Youre giving the cops a good
show
The Leader looks up He glares at Leon

LEADER
You’re dead motherfucker

The gangbangers take off Leon calls to the Girl

LEON
You okay

The Girl shaken looks behind Leon to the way she came
HIP GIRL
How long did you stand there
watching me almost get my throat
slit You fucking asshole

Leon was expecting gratitude

LEON
Thank you very fucking much

She pushes past him running out the station to the tracks

INT SUBWAY CAR - NIGHT 14
The doors of the car hiss as the Hip Girl lands inside

We pull back A LARGE HAND still holding the doors

On the hand a BRACELET OF TWISTED SILVER

The HAND withdraws The doors hiss shut

CLOSE ON the Girls face as she finds a seat

HIP GIRL

INT SUBWAY TRAIN - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER 15

The Hip Girl sits in a nearly empty car the other
passengers having departed She’s at one end and she’s
turned away from the other end But someone is there
At the back of the car over her shoulder we see a LARGE
MAN sitting straight not moving We don’t see him
clearly but he is huge The Hip Girl doesn’t notice

CLOSE ON a LEATHER BAG on the floor by the man A LARGE
HAND goes into the bag It searches for something inside

The hand extracts a LARGE HAMMER from the bag Huge
Back to the Hip Girl who still has seen or heard nothing

But now the LARGE MAN gets up and walks toward the Hip
Girl toward us As he gets close he brings his arm up

The LARGE MAN reaches the Hip Girl The HAMMER above her

equipment in her underwear legs wrapped around a standing
Leon He kisses her neck she looks to the side seeing -

INT OTTO’S RESTAURANT - DAY 19

A trendy downtown restaurant with small tables arranged in
an airy open space On one side a grill and a small bar

Maya serves Leon a leafy salad He puts down his newspaper

Leon smile back at Maya and takes out a small package of
deli paper from his bag He unwraps it meticulously

OTTO 40s the diner’s eccentric and boisterous owner-—
operator pauses by Leon He gives Leon a hard look and
shakes his head

OTTO
Fuck no I’m not doing that
again

LEON

Cmon Otto I’ll pay extra
Just toss it on the grill

Leon takes out a cold gray tofu square from his deli wrap

OTTO
It’s bad for my reputation This
is the best Philly cheese steak
in town The tofu’ll fuck with
my grill How about having one
of my specials instead

Otto takes two steak flanks and tosses them on his grill

LEON
Because I have respect for my
body Otto And for the cow

OTTO
Don’t give me that bull You want
to let your wimpy jelly loaf soak
up all my tasty grease

With that Otto takes a brimming cheese-steak sandwich from
his grill and hefts it It’s enormous The steak slices
are generous and cheese and onions drip all over it

OTTO
My family opened this diner My
heritage is in this cheese-steak
If my nannouo god rest knew I
put that on his grill

Otto shakes his head in disgust Maya rolls her eyes at
Otto Leon smiles

LEON
Alright alright I won’t ask
again

Leon picks up his paper on the counter as he finishes his
meal He turns a page and sees a small photo in the metro
section A pretty girl chic but over-done Like a model

LEON
I think I just saw her

Leon starts reading

LEON
She walked home from a club at
200 in the morning Now they
can’t find her A model She
was celebrating a magazine cover

He takes a closer look Holy shit Now he remembers

LEON
Maya Look at this I saw her
the other night

Maya looks over at Leon not sure what he means
Leon stands trying to remember what happened

LEON
I tried to apologize but she
kept walking

Leon starts gathering his stuff He leaves the deli wrap
with the tofu still open on Otto’s counter

MAYA
Where are you going

LEON
To the police I’1l show them the
pictures Maybe they’1l help

INT POLICE STATION -- OFFICE - DAY

Leon sits in a plastic chair His photos of the Hip Girl
are spread on the desk separating him from DETECTIVE LYNN
HODGE (late 40s) African-American She points to the
gangbangers

HODGE
These individuals ran off after
you made your presence known by
taking their picture

LEON
I also pointed out that they were
being filmed by a surveillance
camera

HODGE
And they ran off toward the
station entrance

LEON
Yes

HODGE
What station was this again

They’ve clearly been over this already Leon controls his
frustration

LEON
The 14th Street station Around
midnight

HODGE

And Loretta ran off in the
opposite direction Toward the
platform You followed her Saw
her board

LEON
Yes

HODGE
But then you left

LEON
I missed the train

He gets uncomfortable

LEON
I thought the photo might help
with the timing and all that

HODGE
(nods )
So will the surveillance tape

Leon stands up feeling embarrassed

LEON
Sounds like you’re all set then

HODGE
Youd think she would’ve stuck
around for a while To thank you
for starters From the looks of
it it didn’t seem like you were
in a hurry Holding out for the
best shot I guess

LEON
I lose myself sometimes
HODGE
You sell your pictures or just
aspiring

LEON

What’s that mean

HODGE
(whos he kidding)
Loretta had a following Some
sheet may pay for them

LEON
Look I didn’t know her

HODGE
Why her then

LEON
What do you mean

HODGE
If it’s not for moneydo you
follow women

LEON
(pissed)
No I shoot everything

HODGE
So why’d you decide to follow
her If you weren’t stalking

Leon searches for an answer Hodge holds his gaze

LEON
I don’t know

HODGE
Trade secret Okay let’s stop
for now

Hodge stands and gives Leon her card

HODGE
Call me if you come up with an
answer I’1ll call you if there’s
anything on those tapes that
doesn’t jibe with your story

INT SUBWAY TRAIN - NIGHT 21

LEIGH and RANDLE COOPER (30s) healthy and sexy well-
dressed out-of-towners sit next to TROY TALEVESKI 30s a
slick stockbroker type in pristine condition

Leigh looks around the car with obvious discomfort

TROY
Don’t worry Leigh I ride this
all the time They erased all
the graffiti about 20 years ago

RANDLE
I don’t think that’s what makes
Leigh nervous
Troy knows Randle is just as nervous as Leigh He grins
TROY
Loosen up you two I took you to
a Broadway show Now you’re
getting the underbelly of the New
York experience
The train comes to a stop and the doors slide open

RANDLE
Where is this place

TROY
You don’t want to know

Troy smiles He knows hes making the out-of-towners
nervous

A group of Hip Hop KIDS stand up with their boom box

Leigh clutches the hand strap cowering behind Randle Troy
bobs his head trying to show the Kids hes down

The Hip Hop Kids simply ignore them and file off the train
As they clear the train we see Mahogany sitting quietly in
the back He is the only other person in the car The train

moves on

RANDLE
How bad can it be

Mahogany watches them taking their measure

TROY
I know a restaurant critic who
wont cover it

Randle raises his eyebrows at Leigh She nervously smiles
back at him

The train approaches another station but rages by Only
Leigh notices

LEIGH
Did we just miss a stop

RANDLE
(to Troy ignoring Leigh)
Troy we didn’t go on vacation to
get shot in a ghetto

Leigh looks out the window Then she looks at Mahogany
Now Mahogany just stares straight ahead Leigh breathes
deeply

TROY
You told me you wanted to
experience the culture Randle
And that’s what I’m going to
deliver

The train rolls down the track lights flickering on and
off Blue sparks from the wheels dance against the tunnel
walls

Leigh looks over at Randle but he doesn’t return her gaze

Mahogany suddenly lurches to his feet He holds his arms
behind his back concealing something

Leigh watches him The two guys face the other way

TROY
If your not up for it we could go
home Leigh could cook us a
romantic dinner for three

RANDLE
What did I say about trying to
charm my wife into bed

LEIGH
(quietly)
Randle

The guys ignore her

TROY
I wouldn’t dream of it But with
anatomy like hers

RANDLE
(joking)
Watch it

Mahogany moves fast taking long strides down the center of
the car Something glints behind him something metal

LEIGH
Randle RANDLE

Randle and Troy turn as Leigh screams but Mahogany is upon
them raising his massive arms

THUD The steel hammer strikes Troy in the temple knocking
him to the floor

Mahogany spins gracefully catching Randle in the gut with
a gigantic meat hook

The train lurches knocking Leigh to the ground

Leigh screams as he lifts the meat hook up hooking into
Randles rib cage

CLOSE on Randles feet as Mahogany lifts him off the floor
above Troys body

The steel hammer finishes Randle with a sickening crunch
He falls to the ground next to his friend

LEIGH
(whimpering)
Why are you doing this

Mahogany pulls the meat hook out of Randle and turns
walking towards Leigh

Leigh scrambles away knocking into his leather bag and
falling to the floor Butcher tools spill across the car

Leigh screams trying to wrap her hand around a long
CARVING KNIFE Mahogany comes up behind her And just as
she is about to get a grip on the blade--

Mahogany grabs her ankles pulling her backwards like a
squealing calf

A glint of metal above her head the arc of the steel
hammer THUD She drops to the ground legs twitching
silent

The lights flicker as the train clatters down the track

INT NEGATIVE SPACE GALLERY - NIGHT 22

Leon sits with Susan Hoff She flips through a folder of
Leons latest prints and stops on one of the pictures of
Loretta Dryer

SUSAN
Talk to me about it

LEON
(defying her)
It is what it is

SUSAN
This is the singer the police are
looking for What’d you tell
them

She gives Leon a look like he has something to confess

LEON
I just happened to be there I
shot what I saw

SUSAN
So you were lucky Or you saw
something Something no one else
saw A girl about to vanish

She gives him a look like he knows more Leon is
completely uncomfortable now

SUSAN
I’m starting to see a point of
view Still tentative But
different

She looks into his eyes
SUSAN
Not the “heart of the city” But
that was just bullshit

She now has a firm grip on his arm and moves in close

SUSAN
I have a group show up next I
can add a few of your shots

Leon is ready to explode but he doesn’t want to blow this

SUSAN
It will be tight but you have
enough time to gather one or two
more Another strong one like
this

INT OTTO’S RESTAURANT - LATER - NIGHT 23

Leon Maya and Jurgis all a bit drunk sit in a corner
booth Maya almost in Leon’s lap Leon tries to be serious

LEON
(lifting his glass)
I owe you Both of you You
believed in this

MAYA
(interrupting)
That’s because you’re great

LEON
Hold on I’ve got to deliver the
show She wants more work

MAYA
Don’t worry so much

JURGIS
She’s right
(smiling)
Besides now it’s not about the
work it’s about spin

Leon and Maya exchange glances

JURGIS
I know this writer who covers the
galleries for a bunch of the
glossies He’s an arrogant little
dick-head but I’1l convince him
youre the new Weegee and he’11
review your exhibition as if it
was the second coming
LEON
Man that’d be great But if he’s
going to write a good review I
want him to like the work

JURGIS
Leon he’s a fucking journalist
What does his opinion matter as
long as he spells your name

right
LEON
(frowning)
Jurgis
JURGIS

Listen Susan is mercurial her
friends are fickle You need to
stay ahead of her We could give
her a little scare

LEON
Hold it I don’t want to get
ahead of anything

JURGIS
Fine But a friend of mine at
Gagosian asked about you You
don’t have to meet her of course
if you don’t want to

MAYA
Do you know any art dealers that
aren’t woman

JURGIS
Plenty but all the powerful ones
are female And usually quite
attractive

He smiles at Maya shining her on
LEON
Did I ever tell you you’re evil
Jurgis

Jurgis smiles benignly Maya puts her arm around Leon

MAYA
It may be a good evil though

EXT CITY STREET -- LATER - NIGHT 24
Four in the morning No one is out Leon walks down an

old street Behind him the Pershing Square subway

Ahead closed store fronts rundown residential hotels

He finds a bench and sits down A shrug What did he

think he’d find at this hour Even bad guys go to bed He
leans back like he might doze off Shuts his eyes

Then very quietly at first footsteps echo on a staircase
They are coming up from the Pershing Square subway station

Camera up Leon jumps up from the bench and ducks behind
it He lines up the subway entrance in his viewfinder

LEON’S POV A large dark shape fills the frame walking
POV The camera lifts slightly and we see an immense head
CLICK Leon takes a shot CLICK He takes another

The man he catches is MAHOGANY A big man in his 50’s with
a crisp white shirt dark brown suit and hair oiled back

He holds a leather bag and eyes straight ahead he walks
alone along the sidewalk on the other side of the street

Leon is fascinated He takes a few more shots until
Mahogany crosses a street a half block away from Leon

Leon lets him walk another twenty feet before he follows
He keeps close to buildings but Mahogany doesn’t look
behind him Mahogany moves very fast for a large man

In a few quick strides Mahogany rounds a corner Leon
breaks into a run stops at the corner and then turns

EXT AROUND THE CORNER - NIGHT 25
No one is on the street Leon swings to his side and--
SLAMS INTO MAHOGANY Mahogany’s bag dropping to the ground
Leon’s busted He backs off then stops disarmed by the
big man’s look Did Mahogany know he had been followed

Mahogany stares right at him inspecting him -- the cat
who’s caught the mouse Leon holds his camera down

LEON
Sorry Mister I just wanted a
picture of you Sometimes I don’t
even think about it

Leon notices Mahogany’s wrist a TWISTED METAL BRACELET
against his starched sleeves A small moon and star

Then Leon’s eyes shift down to the bag on the ground CLOSE
on the engraved “Mahogany” The bag is closed

Noting Leon’s look Mahogany picks his leather bag up We
hear the clang of something metallic and heavy inside
Mahogany hefts the bag and the clang is more pronounced

Leon looks up reacting to the gesture still nervous He
stares at the heavy bag and sees Mahogany’s large hand --

Is that a small spot of red on his wrist Leon freezes
Leon takes a step back suddenly afraid

Mahogany cracks a thin smile and shakes his head no His
gaze locked on Leon A chill runs down Leons spine

Mahogany turns and continues down the street He reaches
the stone staircase of a residential hotel and goes up

Leon stands there as if he stepped in front of a bus

INT LEON’S APARTMENT - DAY - LATER 26

Leon stands at his sink fingering through a stack of
prints He pulls out all his shots of Loretta Dryer and
looks them over He sees something he hadn’t noticed In
his shot of the Homeless Man there is a large man ina
brown suit seen from the back carrying a leather satchel

Leon squints then pulls out his last shot of the Hip Girl
getting on the train He sees the big hand holding the
door On the wrist a thin line A metal bracelet Is
that a moon or just a smudge No just a smudge

Leon lowers the print wondering about the connection

EXT MAHOGANY’S RESIDENTIAL HOTEL - EVENING 27
Mahogany exits the building and walks down the street

Leon peeks out of a doorway He waits a beat then follows

EXT INDUSTRIAL BUILDING -- LATER 28
Leon half a block behind watches Mahogany approach a
small nondescript industrial building He vanishes inside
EXT DRIVE WAY -- LOADING DOCK -- CONTINUOUS 29

Around the side of the building a truck is parked at a
loading dock Leon walks up doesn’t see anyone nearby

Leon jumps up onto the dock and looks into the building

INT INDUSTRIAL BUILDING -- PACKING FLOOR -- CONTINUOUS 30
Leon sees CONVEYORS and a PACKING FLOOR running full tilt
BUTCHERS in blue coveralls weigh and split giant beef
carcasses hanging from METAL HOOKS They slice through the
bones and hack away the fat with SAWS and CLEAVERS

It’s a meat packing plant

Leon is amazed He lifts up his camera to get a shot
CLICK Intestines fall into a stainless steel cart CLICK
Blood is squeegeed through metal grates CLICK A bone saw

sends a cloud of white dust in the air The dust settles

Suddenly at the rear Mahogany emerges from a locker room
putting on blue coveralls Leon jumps back a few feet

Mahogany butcher’s apron on reaches for a side of beef
the size of a man Without stopping he wraps his arms
around it in a gesture like a hug and lifts it like a
pillow He easily tosses it five feet onto a cutting rack

Leon reacts intimidated

EXT MEAT PACKING PLANT -- LATER 31
Leon waits by the corner watching the entrance

Mahogany exits bag in hand Leon reacts and follows

INT SUBWAY STATION -- PLATFORM -- NIGHT - LATER 32

Mahogany stands back away from a group of riders on the
platform He seems to be watching them measuring them

Now we see Leon Camera down he’s even further back He
watches Mahogany standing at a distance so he isn’t seen

Mahogany scans the riders like a hawk We see his eyes

POV A well dressed man and a woman Then a man in an
overcoat distracted with a paper An athletic guy

Back to Leon wondering On his gaze the sound of a train

CLOSE ON the doors of a subway car as they open The
athletic guy enters Mahogany follows right behind

Back to Leon who steps forward Suddenly --
-- A hand grabs his shoulder A big STATION COP

STATION COP
Hey what’s this

The cop jerks Leon’s camera away from him

STATION COP
What’re you taking pictures of

The hiss of the subway doors Leon turns they’re closed

INT SUBWAY TRAIN - NIGHT - LATER 33

The passengers have thinned Mahogany sits in the back
quietly observing the last few riders as they depart

A GUARDIAN ANGEL comes through from a rear car He cocks a
finger and fires at Mahogany who smiles back

The Guardian Angel walks to the front watching as stations
whiz by outside He looks confused The train is not
slowing down He leans down looking out the window

GUARDIAN ANGEL
Why didn’t it stop -

The Guardian Angel turns around Mahogany is there holding
his stainless steel hammer The hammer comes down

WHACK The Guardian Angel hits the floor
Mahogany looms over the Guardian Angel ready to finish the

kill Suddenly pain rips through his guts He drops the
hammer coughing blood onto the floor

CLOSE as the Guardian Angels eyes pop open - red with
exploded blood vessels burning with rage He leaps to his
feet howling like a wounded animal reaching for something
in his sock A curved hunting knife

Mahogany regains control and side steps at the last second
The knife slices into his arm

Mahogany bellows grabbing the Guardian Angels wrist
snapping his arm backwards CRACK The bone shatters The
Guardian Angel screams and drops his knife

The train rounds a corner and speeds up

The two men smash against the seats trying to find enough
balance to kill the other

INT TRAIN DRIVER’S CAB - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS 34

From the front cab the DRIVER of the train can hear the
sounds of a struggle coming from the car behind him He
slows the train a bit And gets up from his seat A thin
man wearing a Transit Authority uniform the Driver has a
craggy and nicked face with the pallor of a man who spends
little time in the sun He’s skinny but looks muscular

INT SUBWAY TRAIN -- NIGHT - CONTINUOUS 35

He opens the door to the car The chaos in front of him is
shocking Two men struggling to kill each other the
Guardian Angel seems to be getting the upper hand

INT TRAIN DRIVER’S CAB - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS 36

The Driver leaving the door open calmly goes back into
his cab He reaches into a compartment and pulls out a
small Glock automatic

INT SUBWAY TRAIN - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS 37

The Driver straight faced quickly walks up to the two
men Both men are on their knees The Guardian Angel
closest to him

Mahogany sees his hammer then he sees the driver walking
toward them with a gun Mahogany reaches for the hammer
just as--

The Driver raises the Glock to the back of the Guardian
Angel’s head

POP The flash of the gun fills the car
The train races on

The Guardian Angel drops to the ground His legs twitching
against the steel floor

Mahogany clutches his arm He checks the wound Blood
spurts onto the floor He looks up to the driver

DRIVER
Clean up the mess Get yourself
patched up you’re not going to
make it

INT OTTO’S RESTAURANT -- NIGHT 38

Maya locks the front door of the diner and turns off some

of the overhead lights As she walks past the counter
something catches her eye A small black box A jewelry

box She stops and reaches out for the small item just as-

A MAN GRABS HER FROM BEHIND MAYA YELPS OUT IN FEAR She
spins around swinging the assailant is - LEON

He laughs wildly
MAYA
You asshole How did you get in
here

She hits his chest with her balled up fist

LEON
Your spare key from home

She collects herself Despite her shaken state - she is
happy to see him

LEON
Don’t worry it’s not an
engagement ring I wouldn’t
propose in Otto’s kitchen

She grabs the box

LEON
I can’t afford one of those
not yet

Maya pops open the box Inside is a PROMISE RING Two bands
- off centered and not quite touching In the middle is a
small flower shaped diamond Almost resembling a star

She takes the ring from the box and slides it on her
finger

LEON
I was iffy on the fitting but it
looks pretty good

Maya kisses Leon

MAYA
It fits great

LEON
I want you to know how much you
mean to me How important it is
to me that we found each other
especially in a big city like
this I want to share everything
with you every moment that lies
ahead

She looks at him deeply and kisses him again with even more
affection

MAYA
Thanks baby

LEON
If Otto knew we were doing this
here he’d probably have a heart
attack He doesn’t have cameras
in here does he

MAYA
No

Leon leans in close to Maya - reaching past her and sliding
his hand across the surface of the counter He looks at his
hand - GREASE staining his finger tips Then he feels
something He pulls back from the grill to look Maya in the
eyes--

She’s undone the top button of his jeans She pulls his
Zipper down

Leon doesn’t waste time He kisses her - biting her bottom
lip She lets out a small seductive squeal Leon slides up
her skirt around her upper thighs and lifts her up onto the
counter He tugs her cotton underwear to the side and
thrusts inside her She sighs heavily

INT DARK SUBWAY CAR -- NIGHT 39
A small dark red hole So dark it’s almost black

It’s dried blood congealed around a small bullet hole

We pull back to see the head of the Guardian Angel

He’s hanging upside down His face is a pale mask the
bullet hole the only dark spot in his waxy forehead

Beneath his head his shirt is neatly folded on his shoes

We move up and see the rest of his body without skin His
skin has been neatly peeled off exposing muscle and bone

Except for one place A thin vertical strip of skin
remains just an inch sliver of pale pink left on his
suspended body

Two large hands in plastic gloves enter the frame They
hold a scalpel In one precise move the strip of flesh is
peeled away neatly The body now resembles an anatomical
model

We track down to the ground by his head There is another
head hanging upsidedown next to him The difference --

The second head has two wide-open eyes filled with horror
A gag in place in the victim’s mouth no scream can be
heard but the head belongs to a MAN WHO IS STILL ALIVE
Trembling

Beneath the man a shirt folded on a pair of shoes We
track along the floor A second folded shirt And then a
large spray of blood

INT SUBWAY TUNNEL -- NIGHT 40
The train roars through the tunnel As it flickers by we

catch a glimpse of SIX NAKED BODIES hanging upside down -
and then the train is gone

INT LEON’S APARTMENT - NIGHT 41
CLOSE ON something red which explodes and splashes juice

Leon slices a tomato on a cutting board drops the slices
into a large salad bowl filled with lettuce

Maya enters Leon’s work area on her way to the kitchen
She stops as something catches her eyes

Pictures line the walls All tacked up neatly ALL OF
MAHOGANY

MAYA
Leon what’s this Is this for
your show

LEON
No he’s a butcher He was at
the station when Loretta Dryer
vanished I photographed him

MAYA
What are you doing

LEON
There’s something disturbing
about him

She reacts

MAYA
Youre right about that Leon
what’s wrong with you You
should be focusing on your show

Leon meets eyes with her and then averts her gaze

MAYA
You went to the police with your
photos Whatever is going on
they’1l figure it out

LEON
Or they won’t

MAYA
It’s not your problem I’m your
problem Can you please let this
go Please Leon For me

He smiles at her reflecting

LEON
Yes

We stay on Leon as Maya walks to the cabinet and pulls down
dishes from a shelf We see that his yes means no

INT DARK SUBWAY CAR -- NIGHT 42
A dark shape hangs from the ceiling of an otherwise empty
subway car It trembles like a slender cocoon shaking and
writhing But it is a body with its hands tied up Weve
seen this car before Metal hooks hang from the ceiling

A large man seen only from the back approaches the hanging
body and he holds the body still with one gloved hand

The man now runs his hand over the body which jerks in
response Suddenly we see the man’s other hand Also
gloved it holds a long glistening blade The man thrusts
it in the body

Now we see the victim clearly for the first time --

It’s Leon

His face filled with terror he reacts in agony to the

blow

INT LEON’S BEDROOM -- NIGHT - CONTINUOUS 43
Leon’s eyes are open He knows it was a nightmare but he
is deeply disturbed Anxious he just stares at the

ceiling

He looks over at Maya in bed next to him Sound asleep

INT LIBRARY -- MICROFICHE CUBICLE -- AFTERNOON 44
Leon sits at an old library cubicle lit poorly by a soft
amber overhead He runs microfiche on an old-style fiche
reader with images hand-cranked on a white screen

He stops on a newspaper front page type a bit blurred

The headline is simple “BUTCHER HELD IN KILLINGS”

CLOSE ON the headline date December 19 1895

INT HOTEL ROOM - BATHROOM -- EVENING 45

Mahogany’s face appears in a bathroom mirror He runs a
comb through his hair washes the comb puts it on the
sink A splash of cologne on his cheeks The cologne goes
back in a cabinet its place is marked with a thin outline
Mahogany nudges the bottle to perfection with his finger

A muscular shoulder comes into the frame We reveal more
of the shoulder until we see a gauze bandage He curls
the bandage back and we see a growth like a boil It is
flat but large composed of barnacle-like bubbles They
are moist glistening Are they moving He examines them

Now he pulls open a drawer and we see an assortment of
scalpels neatly arrayed by size in a cutlery rack He
takes one in his hand and pushes it into the edge of the
growth cutting underneath A line of blood appears but
he cuts further He peels the growth off as he shaves it

He places the shaving into a green glass bottle then
screws it tightly shut He places it in another drawer
and we see a collection of green bottles each filled

Then he is wracked by a cough deep enough to cause him to
lean over He reaches into the cabinet and takes out a

dark pill bottle He opens it takes one straightens up
EXT STREET BY PACKING PLANT - DAY 46
Mahogany crosses the empty street to the packing plant

A moment later Leon emerges from the shadows He sneaks
around the back of the plant

INT MAIN PACKING FLOOR - DAY 47
Leon climbs through a window onto a ledge slightly above

the packing floor His camera in his hand he jumps to the

ground

He sneaks forward hiding behind a column Now he readies
his camera spying through columns on the Workers opposite

His first sight of the full floor stuns him The
production line is running full tilt A powerful stench
rises from the line Not a rotting stench Rather a
steam of blood drops

It almost overwhelms Leon who feels the blood like a mist

Leon swings up his camera and looks through the lens

POV A man in a white coat clearly the boss looks across
the floor at his crew but he doesn’t say a word Another
worker a butcher gives the boss a look but he turns
away

Leon slowly pans his camera snapping photos blood and
guts bones and hooks the machines grinding out processed
meat

THROUGH LENS We track across the length of the production
line seeing the conveyor chains which pull the lines
along Now we tilt down slightly and a LARGE FACE fills
the frame

MAHOGANY stares directly at us eyes looking into the lens
Leon reacts Mahogany has caught him

But maybe not Mahogany turns away walking out of frame
Leon follows him with the lens

POV Mahogany stands at a tool bench and looks for

something He picks up a large knife and examines it He
twists it

Now Mahogany looks directly at us once more He must see
us

Leon jumps back hyperventilating Mahogany moves quickly
across the floor carrying the knife he got at the bench

Leon makes a quick break running back along the inside
wall

He backtracks to the window he came through and he sees --
Two men in butcher coats blocking his path

Leon hides behind a column unable to see the floor He
leans around the column Mahogany stands just ten feet

away

Leon moves back behind the column He checks the window
The two men still block his path to the window He waits

He leans out again and sees --

Mahogany is walking toward him Leon sees a side hallway

INT HALLWAY - DAY - CONTINUOUS 48
Leon runs down the corridor trying all the doors He

finds an open one and slips inside It is a small meat
locker

INT MEAT LOCKER - DAY - CONTINUOUS 49

Leon turns around A few CARCASSES hang from hooks

Condensation rises from the cold wet floor The sound of
dripping blood echoes against the metal walls

Footsteps in the hallway Mahogany approaches Leon looks
for an escape but there is only the one door

Leon pushes into the meat A sound behind The door
opens

Leon grabs onto a chain and pulls himself a few feet up
Mahogany moves down the side using the hook to move the
beef aside He crouches to check under the meat No one
there

Leon desperately hangs onto the chain his arms shaking

Drip drip drip Something hits Leons forehead He looks
up a piece of meat swings above him

Leon almost drops Mahogany grunts pushing through the
meat

Leon almost slips on the chain Mahoganys shoes are
closer Then the shoes walk away We hear steps then
none

Leon aches to let go of the chain but he waits No sound

He takes a breathand drops to the floor No one there

He turns --
-- And Mahogany is standing right before him A few feet
The two men stare eye to eye for just a second Then --

Leon bolts running as fast as he can to the door slipping
once on the floor but lunging ahead He’s out the door

Leon hits the plant floor -- but Mahogany is right behind

Leon sees the overhear production track across the aisle
and he throws himself at the closest hook He cuts his
hand but the hook jerks him a few feet ahead of Mahogany

Leon jumps down and turns Mahogany has crossed the gap

Leon runs as fast as he can through hanging sides of beef
slipping once but not stopping Mahogany lunges after him

Leon reaches the open truck dock at the same time as his
pursuer -- but Leon sees an open bed truck pulling out
EXT MEAT PLANT -- LOADING DOCK -- CONTINUOUS 50

Leon throws himself into the open bed of the truck as it
accelerates Mahogany makes a hard stop at the dock

Mahogany just stands still Just watching not moving

INT LEON’S APARTMENT -- SHOWER - LATER THAT AFTERNOON 51
Leon stands under the shower the water pounding against

his head Leon scrubs his hands with a brush The blood and
filth is gone but he keeps scrubbing harder and harder

INT OTTO’S RESTAURANT - DAY 52

A slab of raw meat hits the griddle The juices quickly
sear against the heat

Maya is busy with a table of patrons Jurgis is at the
counter Otto’s at the grill

Leon comes in the front door sits down next to Jurgis
JURGIS

What happened to you today No
phone call no interview

LEON
Sorry Jurgis I completely
flaked

JURGIS

Can I say something to you
without you taking it the wrong
way You look like shit

Otto sets down Jurgis’s rare meat patty and a side salad

LEON
I’m fine

JURGIS
You still look like shit

Leon stares down at Jurgis’s plate

JURGIS
This is what you need
Nourishment Real nourishment
You want some

Leon hesitates

Jurgis neatly cuts off a quarter of his burger with a knife
and fork Then he offers the piece to Leon

JURGIS
You don’t have to feel bad about
the cow That cow lived in
comfort and died in its sleep

Leon gives Jurgis an “as if” look

JURGIS
C’mon cows don’t worry about it
They know they’re not the top of
the food chain

LEON
How do you know we’re the top of
the food chain

OTTO
Well if we aren’t they’d have
to get past me

Then Leon opens the bun and take out the piece of beef
It’s cooked rare A glistening trail of shiny grease runs
down Leon’s finger He experimentally licks it off Then he
bites into the bloody beef

Jurgis and Otto trade a surprised look

JURGIS
It melts right Like butter

Leon nods his eyes glazed over for a moment Then he
swallows He’s silent wheels turning in his head

LEON
(to Otto)
Otto I’ll take one of my own

INT LEONS APARTMENT - LATER THAT DAY 53
Maya’s purse still hangs on her shoulder She stands by

the door uncertain as Leon reorganizes some photos He
doesn’t notice her

MAYA
You look like shit

Leon hangs up new photos on the wall He turns around She
tosses her purse down

LEON
You’re the second person who’s
said that to me today

MAYA
But I’m the first person who
cares

She steps closer puts her hand on his shoulder She pushes
his hair away from his forehead Then-

She looks past him at the photos on the wall The photos
are incredibly intense ALL OF MAHOGANY AND THE MEAT PLANT

MAYA
These aren’t for your show are
they

Maya pulls down a photo tosses it and walks away

MAYA
I asked you to stop this And
you agreed you would

Seeing her concern he becomes more serious

LEON
I think I know what’s going on
People disappear for all sorts of
reasons But it’s random right

Maya gives him her sternest look

LEON
In this area by the subway it’s
not There’s a cluster

(MORE )

LEON (contd)
I checked I think this guy is
doing something He takes people
from the train and does something
to them At the meat plant

MAYA
Does what Leon

LEON
(carefully)
He dismembers them That’s why
they aren’t found

Maya gives him a grim look then she just laughs

MAYA
So they’re hamburger
(straight face)
Otto had a bad batch last week
but he tossed it

Leon isn’t laughing Now Maya watches him carefully He
lifts a folder from his table and pulls out a photo

CLOSE ON an older weathered version of the meat plant

LEON
I pulled it from an architectural
survey The place has been here
since the nineteenth century

MAYA
Leon
Leon takes another sheet from the folder -- a clipping
MAYA
Enough

She stands before him puts a hand on his arm

LEON
No look what I found

The clipping is a copy of a newspaper article an old one
by its typeface

LEON
I went to the TIMES Their old
stuff isn’t online yet

CLOSE ON an old headline and front page article --

April 11 1896 Meat Company Butcher Cleared of Charges of
Cannibalism “The city attorney has concluded his highly
confidential investigation of claims by a company employee
that local butcher engaged in murder and cannibalism

“The city attorney’s office was never able to connect the
butcher with any of the city’s many missing persons nor
establish where the allegedly ill-gotten meat went”

MAYA
(staring at it)
It’s from a century ago

LEON
That’s right but the same
packing plant A butcher was
accused of murder

MAYA
A hundred years ago What are
you thinking It’s the same guy
That’s he’s reincarnated

LEON
No just that it’s happened
before It’s too weird It
can’t be a coincidence

She can’t believe how stupid this sounds

MAYA
There are no vampires

LEON
That’s not what I mean

Leon points back to the wall of Mahogany shots

LEON
This guy is involved I know it
I’ve seen him I’ve looked in his
eyes it’s more than an instinct

MAYA
(interrupting)
This is too stupid Nothing is
happening Please stop For me

Leon wraps his arms around her She looks at the camera
on the table She touches his face and looks in his eyes

MAYA
Come on shoot something you
like

She motions to the camera She backs away from him She
leans against the sink She unbuttons her blouse and skirt

Leon reaches for the camera His face is serious He gets
up from the table Backs away from her Raises the camera
to his eye

Maya’s skirt drops to the floor She slips her feet out of
them She puts her head down

LEON’S POV Her hair covering her face Leon snaps a
picture

She looks up to him Her eyes meeting the lens She’s
beautiful Vulnerable Leon snaps a picture

She pulls her shirt up over her head Leon snaps a picture

She stands there Nearly naked In her underwear and her
bra Simple refreshing to Leon He snaps a picture-

But this time -

As the flash bounces off her skin An image burns in Leon’s
eyes A flash of horror in his mind Meat Blood Death He
shakes it off

Maya reaches back - starts to unhook her bra Leon snaps a
picture The flash Again a brief image of horror A brief
flash of Susan Hoff

Maya lets her bra fall from her shoulders but she keeps
herself covered Looking right into her eyes this time he
snaps another picture

A flash of horror again Mahogany Leon physically jumps
for a moment

He shakes it off but immediately stops

He lowers the camera away from his face A look of distress
in his eyes

Maya suddenly feels very self conscious She fastens her
bra Looks down to the ground with a brief sense of shame

glances up at the front door Leon has just come in
looks at Leon then back to Otto Leon comes up

LEON
(to Maya)
Can I talk to you a minute I’m
sorry about yesterday

stares back at Otto hoping he’ll give Maya a break
gives an unsympathetic look and heads for the kitchen

OTTO
(walking)
My hands are full

MAYA
(busy)
Is later okay

LEON
You were right that’s what I
wanted to say

She gives him a warm kiss but has to get back to work She
breaks the moment and heads off

Leon drops his shoulders and sits at the counter He
thinks about a cup of coffee Then he turns to the door

THE FRONT DOOR IS FILLED WITH AN IMMENSE SHAPE --

A HUGE MAN IN A SUIT STANDING OUTSIDE BLOCKS THE WINDOW
MAHOGANY

Leon reacts But Mahogany doesn’t enter He just looks
in Straight at Leon Maya crosses in front but his
stare is fixed on Leon Leon gets up from the counter

Mahogany doesn’t move Then he walks away from the door

Leon looks at the door He thinks a second then follows

INT PERSHING SQUARE STATION - NIGHT 55

Walking through the station Mahogany stops and turns
Leon ducks into an alcove trying not to be seen

Mahogany turns back and goes on Leon waits a beat then
reappears from the alcove He hurries after Mahogany
INT SUBWAY TRAIN - LATER THAT NIGHT 56

Leon follows Mahogany between cars staying back

Late night riders exit the train Club Kids Drunks
Cleaning Ladies and Businessmen Cops Flowing on and off

The train leaves the station Leon waits patiently in the
back car watching Mahogany through the doors

A VOICE behind Leon startles him

VOICE (0OS)
MandMs You want some MandMs

Two SCRAWNY BLACK KIDS holding boxes of candy Leon shakes
his head no waving the kids away

SCRAWNY KID 1
Whatever

The Kids move into the next car One of them approaches
Mahogany The lights on the train flicker on and off
Plunging the car into darkness momentarily
SCRAWNY KID 1

You want to buy some MandMs

mister
Mahogany stares at the kid not responding The lights
flicker again Kid 2 notices something he doesn’t like
about Mahogany Something in his eyes that scares him
Kid 2 leans in close to kid 1

SCRAWNY KID 2
Go to someone else

Kid 1 just ignores him

SCRAWNY KID 1
Come on man Buy some MandMs

Mahogany leans forward reaching for his leather bag
Leon moves to the door ready to rush in
SCRAWNY KID 1

Suck my dick cheap ass
longer this time Kid 2 pulls on Kid 1’s shoulder The
lights come back on
The train slows
The Kids move to exit at the station

They look back toward Mahogany and quickly run from the
train The doors close and the train pulls away

INT SUBWAY TRAIN - LATER THAT NIGHT

The train is now empty except for TWO BOYS making out in

the front seat Mahogany looks up He walks into the rear

car to check if its clear There is no one there

ANGLE under the seat Leon lays on the ground watching
Mahoganys feet Mahogany leaves closing the doors

Leon waits holding his breath Trying to stay calm

THUD A scream from the front car shouting and wailing

The lights flicker again - plunging the car into darkness

A SECOND THUD And then silence Leon closes his eyes And
waits

The train is not stopping It seems to be picking up speed

Leon crawls out from under the seat and takes his camera
out of his pack His hands are shaking

He slides up to the window in the connecting door and peeks
into the front car Leon drops down wincing

LEON
Oh God Oh God

He sets the aperture and slowly peeks up again

Through the lens Mahogany hangs BOY 1 up to the hand
straps by his feet

CLICK Mahogany slits Boys throat spilling his blood into
a metal pail

CLICK Their clothes neatly wrapped in plastic bags

CLICK Mahogany uses pliers to remove toe nails from Boy

2
CLICK He hangs up Boy 2 pulling off strips of skin

Leon drops back down his body revolting against his mind
Leon pulls out a new canister of film from his pocket

It falls from his hand and rolls across the floor

Footsteps Mahoganys coming back Leon scrambles under the
seat pressing himself against the wall

Mahoganys feet walk by He takes something from a
maintenance closet in the back of the car He returns

LEONS POV the film canister sits in the middle of the
floor Mahoganys feet pause momentarily then move on

Leon closes his eyes until the connecting doors close
After a moment he crawls out from under the seat

PULL BACK to reveal Mahogany standing on the seat above
Leon - the steel mallet over his head

Leon rolls out of the way as the hammer crashes down next
to his head He scrambles to his feet running to the back
of the car Mahogany is right behind him

MAHOGANY GRABS THE CAMERA AROUND LEON’S NECK Leon ducks
out of the strap rushing toward the front car

Leon pulls on the connecting doors Theyre stuck Mahogany
rushes down the car grunting Leon sees the lock and flips
the lever He rips the doors open as Mahogany grabs for
him

Leon flies forward onto the floor landing by Mahoganys
tool bag He grabs the bag swinging it back into Mahoganys
face

Mahogany stumbles back as the tools hit his chest Leon
jumps up pushing his way through the swinging corpses

The train lurches Leon stumbles falling into one of the
bloody corpses He grabs the raw flesh to keep from
falling

The body rips loose and Leon falls to the floor face to
face with the dead boy Leon shouts kicking it away

Mahogany is upon him Leon kicks the bucket of blood at
him spilling it across the floor Mahogany slips in the
blood falling backwards hammer flying out of his hand

Leon runs for the driver’s cabin He bangs on the door
LEON
Stop the train Please Help me
Stop the fucking train

No response Leon moves to the train doors forcing them
open The jagged rock walls shoot by at incredible speed

Leon steadies himself prepared to jump to his death He
closes his eyes lets out a yell and jumps

A LARGE HAND grabs him at the last second pulling him back
onto the floor of the train

LEONS POV up at Mahogany The hammer comes down THUD

INT SUBWAY TRAIN - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS 58
Total silence The train has stopped Then-

The sound of the doors opening

Leon partially comes to - he’s hanging upside down from his

ankles at the edge of the doorway of the subway car near
the two BOYS His feet are bare His shirt is off

He sees the outline of Mahogany in the dimness just outside
the open doors

Through Leon’s hallucinatory haze he sees that the car is
stopped but he can see no sign of a platform or station

Blackness engulfs everything Then--

Leon screams in terror and pain as he is swung violently
around by something unseen

Blood flows down into Leon’s eyes - further blurring his
vision He can’t see what’s attacking him Something is
carving away at his chest Tearing at the skin

Through the train doors Leon can see Mahogany It’s not
Mahogany who is carving at Leon’s chest It’s a non-human
appendage with what appears to be barnacle-like growths
Mahogany takes a step toward the interior but he sees Leon
and turns away His expression shows nothing He just
vanishes from sight

Leon’s world spins and he passes out again coughing blood
and straining against the unseen terror

FADE TO BLACK

INT STAIRCASE - EARLY MORNING 59

The top of a poorly-lit staircase with metal guard rails
Leon pulls himself to the last stair and takes a breath

His face and clothes are filthy his beard unshaven
Focusing he looks around No blood around just moisture

He faces a plated metal door with old double locks He
grips the metal latch beneath the locks and pulls it hard

The door swings open on a brightly-illuminated space the
light almost giving Leon a white-out But he recognizes
the noise right away It’s the clanging of a packing line

The door Leon opened leads directly into the meat plant

INT MEAT PLANT -- CONTINUOUS 60

Leon emerges inside the meat plant and stops Several
butchers work on sides of beef They just ignore him

INT LEONS APARTMENT - MORNING 61

The front door opens Leon walks in he stands in the
shadow of the hallway Maya is on the couch she can’t
quite see him yet

MAYA
Youre alive

Leon stays silent

MAYA
Where have you been

Leon continues walking She follows

MAYA
You can’t just disappear What
am I suppose to think You
couldve been killed for all I
know

Leon rubs his forehead not knowing what to say He pulls
his hand down Dried blood streaked on his palm

Leon steps into the light She sees the blood on his hand
Sees the wound on his head She puts her hand on his head

MAYA
What happened to you

Leon ignores her pulls her hand off his head and brushes

by her to the bathroom

INT BATHROOM - DAY - MOMENTS LATER 62
Leon reaches into the medicine cabinet he cringes -
something stings bad He unbuttons his shirt and the color

drains from his face as he discovers-

A MARK CARVED ACROSS HIS UPPER CHEST AN EMBLEM OF SOME
KIND It’s crusty and infectious

Leon doesn’t remember know how it got there He touches it
delicately

She leans against the door jiggling the locked doorknob

MAYA
Let me in Let me help you
(beat)
Please
INT BATHROOM - DAY - CONTINUOUS 64

Leon ignores her and methodically buttons up his shirt
hiding the injury

He puts a stopper in the sink and fills it with water He
lathers his hands with soap and pats his arm gingerly by a
large weeping cut

The sink full he puts his head down into the bowl getting
his face and hair wet He takes out his head pushes his
hair back Then dabs his face carefully with the towel

He rifles through the cabinet below the vanity and pauses
at some bandages He ignores them and reaches for a roll
of duct tape He starts to wind the tape around his arm to
bind the cut

He continues winding and winding endlessly

INT APARTMENT - DAY - CONTINUOUS 65
Maya is still leaning against the door Suddenly Leon

opens the door and Maya has to jump back She reacts to
his appearance

His wet hair is slicked back his face freshly shaved he
suddenly seems more youthful but also a bit waxen

Maya takes hold of his arm but he shakes her hand off
MAYA
(pleading)
What happened to you

Leon walks past her then turns back to answer

LEON
I need to sleep now

He goes into the bedroom closes the door

Maya breathes deep and forces open the bedroom door

INT BEDROOM - DAY - CONTINUOUS 66

Maya sees Leon examining the gash on his chest It is
still bleeding Profusely She reacts in horror then
goes over to him

Closer she sees the hideous shape on Leon’s chest

MAYA
Oh my God What is this Leon
We’ve got to go to the hospital

LEON
(ignoring her)
He butchers them like meat I
saw it with my own eyes I took
pictures

MAYA
(frantic)
Where did you go

LEON
I followed him into the subway

MAYA
(explodes )
Why did you do that

He thinks for a moment

LEON
Don’t you see It’s always a
late train maybe the same one
each time He waits for it to
empty No bodies are found
because he removes them

Maya is still upset and now even more confused

MAYA
What are you talking about

Leon’s is piecing it together for himself in a jumbled way
LEON

There’s an abandoned subway
station beneath the meat plant

MAYA
He takes them there

LEON
I don’t know But the police
will never find anything

MAYA
(worried)
Baby let’s just take you to the
hospital and your photos to
Detective Hodge

LEON
No Maya the police won’t listen

MAYA
They have to listen

LEON
My camera’s gone He took it
from me

Leon motions to the hotel across the street

LEON
Without that I have nothing I
have to take care of this myself

MAYA
Yourself I’m not going to stand
here and let you get yourself
killed I’m calling the police

Maya barges out of the bedroom - into the kitchen - and
grabs Detective Hodge’s card from the wall where it’s
taped The she grabs her cell phone from her purse She
dials

Leon comes up behind her and grabs the phone from her hand

He throws it against the wall smashing it into pieces
Maya stands there - stunned Leon breaths heavily

LEON
I said no They’1l think I’ma
fucking lunatic

Maya stares at Leon She doesn’t know how to get through

MAYA
(trying to be focused)
I know something happened down
there I can see it But you’ve
got to let me help you

Leon looks at Maya for a long moment then--
LEON
I have to sleep I have to be
ready for the opening tonight
Leon walks back to the bedroom Maya watches him go down
the hallway Leon disappears into the bedroom She slowly
begins to walk towards the room

She gets to the threshold Stands there

MAYA
Leon

She stands for a moment in silence - then closes the door

EXT MAHOGANY’S HOTEL - EVENING

Maya stands on the street corner watching Mahogany’s
hotel Jurgis is behind her unsure if they should be
there

JURGIS
This is crazy

MAYA
I know But I don’t know what
else to do
Maya turns Detective Hodge’s card in her hand thinking
MAYA
Leon’s right the police will
think were crazy
Suddenly out of the corner of her eye Maya sees --
Mahogany exiting down the front stairs
Maya pushes Jurgis back into a doorway Mahogany looks in

their direction but then turns the other way He walks
down the street making a half block in a few long strides

INT MAHOGANY’S HOTEL FOYER - NIGHT 68

Maya and Jurgis walk into the old lobby and sees a
concierge counter on one side of a cracked linoleum floor
No one is there so they walk up Behind the counter are
mailboxes

Maya sees Mahogany’s name on one box It says 6 A spare
key dangles from a hook above the box She reaches over the
counter for the key when suddenly she hears a rattling
COUGH and the sound of someone moving in the back room She
freezes exchanges a glance with Jurgis - it’s now or
never She grabs the key

INT MAHOGANY’S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS 69

Maya enters the dark room She passes down a small foyer
then enters the main room It’s dark and wide Shafts of
light peek through the closed blinds In the main room is a
couch and an old TV Maya walks by a small kitchen as she
makes her way deeper into the room

INT MAHOGANY’S KITCHEN - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS 70

Maya enters and looks around She sees a cupboard with
drawers and she quietly opens one to have a look Rows of
carving knives rattle as the drawer moves She pulls out a
lower drawer Surgical devices which seem medical She
opens the lowest drawer Wound retractors of every type

Her eyes are drawn to the sink It’s empty but the white
surface is stained a rusty red The drain is clotted with
hair Next to the drain two green bottles She lifts

one Inside there is something with moist white bubbles

She drops it and backs away in disgust - a sudden surge of
fear and adrenaline courses through her limbs

She spins around and--
SLAMS INTO JURGIS They both gasp

MAYA
(quietly)
Why are you up here What if he
comes back

JURGIS
Even if he did how would I tell
you from downstairs

Point taken

MAYA
We need to find the camera and
get out of here fast

There is a short hallway to her left leading to a bedroom
She stares at the dark hall

JURGIS
Ill check the bedroom

Jurgis makes his way down the hall Then something in the
main room catches Maya’s eye Something out of places
sitting on a desk---

A BLACK VALISE Maya walks closer to it The light hits
its pitch black sheen in such a way it reflects like a
mirror

Maya places her hand on it She runs her palm across it
It feels like flesh - pulled so tight that it shines like
metal

ON ITS TOP LID -- AN ETCHED DRAWING OF A MOON AND SINGLE
STAR

Maya puts her hands on the latches waits a beat pops
them

The valise springs open to reveal two interior
compartments one a leather pouch the other a small tool
rack

Maya stares at the rack No tool is recognizable Each
has sharp spirals and corkscrew edges If they are for a
surgery you don’t want to have it Butchers don’t use
these

The leather pouch contains an old datebook Maya turns to
the start and finds a table of contents every entry
written in symbols which suggests an ancient form of
Cyrillic

INT MAHOGANY’S HOTEL ROOM BEDROOM - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

Jurgis searches at a bedside table He sees something
stops

INT MAHOGANY’S HOTEL ROOM MAIN ROOM - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS 72

Maya turns the pages of the datebook and finds more of the
old writing Then she finds a page with a long list of
dates

The first is from 1733 There is a date followed by a
number Each page is filled with similar entries In 1751
the handwriting changes It changes every generation or so

She reacts to a page dated 1896 There are many entries
clustered on this one page Next page still 1896 more

MAYA
Shit

The last section has some new pages added A calendar
pasted into the binding She flips through it and sees
several months with starred dates but no entries Many
days in each month have a moon and star -- but no writing

Close on the doorknob it rattles slightly and then slowly
begins to turn

Jurgis
INT MAHOGANY’S HOTEL ROOM BEDROOM - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS 75
Jurgis doesn’t hear a thing He carefully opens a dresser
drawer Nothing but folded linens He quietly closes it
and makes his way toward the closet across the room
He opens it It creaks slightly Inside are six identical
brown suits all in dry cleaning bags He pushes a couple
aside A couple more then--
THE LEICA - hanging from a coat hanger Jurgis beams and

grabs the camera from the hanger He places the straps
around his neck and spins for the exit--

HAMMER AT HIS SIDE JURGIS STANDS FROZEN A SCARED ANIMAL
INT MAHOGANY’S HOTEL ROOM KITCHEN - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS 76
Maya stands against a cupboard out of sight from the main
room She doesn’t move just listens She can’t her
anything Wait She hears a sharp exhale just outside
She moves forward slowly carefully She can just see into
the main room Nothing there She moves a few more
inches

Maya holds back her emotions but she has no choice but to
find Jurgis She moves into the main room from the
kitchen
She looks around The old datebook is where she left it

She takes one step at a time toward the bedroom then
stops

We pull back just a few feet --

Now we are in the bedroom looking out --

And into the frame comes the blunt end of a steel hammer
Mahogany holds it above the door It’s covered with blood

Through the door we see Maya looking carefully around

INT MAHOGANY’S HOTEL ROOM MAIN ROOM -- NIGHT - CONTINUOUS8
Cautiously Maya steps right up to the bedroom door

She gets close enough to look in She can’t see Jurgis

But there is a coat hanger laid on the bed

She takes one more step She is about to call Jurgis

Suddenly she turns and runs toward the outer door

Without stopping she grabs the datebook with one hand and
yanks the doorknob with the other She pulls the door so
hard it swings wide open and she flies into the hallway

EXT MAHOGANY’S HOTEL -- LATER 79

In the shadow of a store front across from the hotel Maya

his finely pressed shirt - the wound hidden beneath

INT POLICE STATION OFFICE - NIGHT 83
Maya sits in a chair opposite the desk we’ve seen before
She’s anxious and she fiddles with the strap of her bag

Detective Hodge walks into the room looking stressed out

HODGE
Maya Jones
Maya nods standing up She’s shaken

MAYA
Did you find Jurgis

HODGE
Calm down Sit down

Maya sits still shaking

HODGE
I just received a report from the
officers at the scene

Now Hodge gives Maya a look gauging her

HODGE
They went to the room you gave
me but there was no one there

MAYA
(frantic)
Jurgis was there

HODGE
No one was in the room and there
was no sign of trouble

MAYA
That can’t be right

HODGE
They met the tenant in the lobby
He let them examine the place
He had been out the whole day

MAYA
No He’s a butcher and Leon
thinks he kills people

HODGE
What are you talking about

MAYA
I was in the room I saw the
tools he uses

Hodge reacts strongly

HODGE
You what

MAYA
Listen My friend Jurgis is in
trouble He was with me He
never came out The butcher came
back and Jurgis may be hurt

HODGE
There was no one there

MAYA
Please Come back with me I’1l
show you

Hodge pauses a second without answering looking at Maya

HODGE
The tenant told the officers that
an old heirloom was missing A
family album

Maya returns Hodge’s look and grows steely

MAYA
I think you mean a datebook It
records all the murders It goes
back a hundred years

HODGE
You took it

Maya sits back in the chair thinking calculating

HODGE
Let me see it Miss Jones

MAYA
I don’t have it I ran out too
fast I wanted to go back but
you told me not to

HODGE
Youve admitted to breaking and
entering that’s very serious I
can hold you for that

MAYA
(not backing down)
The hotel room was filled with
butcher tools Murder weapons
If you don’t go back with me I
will go back with someone else

HODGE
Ms Jones If you go back you
will be arrested You are upset
but listen If you have the
album you can return it without
any acknowledgement of guilt

MAYA
I told you I don’t have it

HODGE
The tenant doesn’t want to press
charges I’11 give you a pass
He just wants his book back

MAYA
The butcher So he can do more
killing You know about the
murders don’t you

No response from Hodge Maya gets up turns to the door

MAYA
Did you say you were going to
arrest me

Hodge doesn’t answer Maya walks outas Hodge watches

INT NEGATIVE SPACE GALLERY - NIGHT

Susan escorts Leon through the Gallery She’s speaking
closely to his ear There is a good crowd thirty or more

people

Clusters of buyers circle around the prints

Susan is charged She steers Leon into the crowd

SUSAN
Bill and Sue Bennett buy what I
tell them Usually my third
suggestion A few will want
separate time with you But it
means a sale

An older couple smiles at Susan

SUSAN

Then shine them on

painter than a photographer

Susan’s assistant comes up He whispers in her ear

SUSAN

business Be right back

Susan gives Leon a look and vanishes

LEON
I did that in school Painting

CLOSE ON LEON’S SHIRT A hint of blood soaks through from
the carving on Leon’s chest

LEON
(to Jack and Andee)
Excuse me

Leon turns into a side room and looks at his shirt Shit
He looks for the restroom Where Susan is standing He
scans the room His eye is caught by a RED DOT next to one
of his prints A savage image of murder He looks around

The gallery walls feature five large format color prints
All show horrific violence one including a knife blade
piercing scarlet muscle Collectively they totally stun

Leon steps back One print alone reveals that the violence
is directed at sides of beef A butcher is seen Mahogany

Leon approaches the photo Mahogany stares back with a
cold ruthlessness The large print is overwhelming

Leon is arrested by all the images His look is intense
Then abruptly he puts his hand on his shirt
CLOSE ON LEON’S SHIRT More blood soaks through the shirt
Susan approaches from behind

SUSAN
I didn’t mean for you to hide

Cmon it’s time for the Franks

Leon glares at Susan then turns to another image

SUSAN
I’m not waiting for that one to
sell

Leon ignores her staring at the image It’s an immense
shot of the subway hallway Loretta staring right at us

SUSAN
Leon

Leon doesn’t answer Then he turns and starts walking

SUSAN
Where are you going

No response so Susan grabs his arm
SUSAN
(angry)
I said where are you going
He yanks his arm free and points at the subway shot
LEON
(a smile)

I’m going to catch a train

With that Leon bolts for the door Susan is stunned

Suddenly Maya slams against Hodge knocking her back

MAYA

Hodge grabs her arm and pushes her against the wall

Immediately Maya shakes loose and turns Hodge around

88 EXT MEAT PACKING PLANT - NIGHT 88
Leon steps up to the front door It’s locked He looks
through the window and sees a SECURITY GUARD Leon is
about to knock Then he changes his mind

In the background the grinding hum of saws and machines

Leon starts around the side of the meat packing plant and
the grinding becomes louder He reaches a driveway

Down the driveway is a loading dock No one is around

Leon walks to the driveway and disappears in the plant

EXT CITY STREETS - NIGHT 89
Maya makes her way through the dark street It’s late now

INT SUBWAY STATION - TURNSTILE -- NIGHT - CONTINUOUS 90
Maya walks up to the turnstile A few late night

stragglers wait to pass through Two TRANSIT COPS keep a
watchful eye

Maya keeps an eye on the Transit Cops as she scans the

crowd for Leon Looking at all the faces on their evening
commute

Then right next to her stands a LARGE HEAVYSET MAN

Maya shudders and turnsbut it’s a young blond man no
more than twenty smiling a bright harmless smile

Maya walks through the turnstile

INT MAIN PACKING FLOOR - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS 91

The line is running full tilt carcasses swing down the
track sides of beef split ground meat squeezed out

Leon sees a laundry bag with dirty butcher smocks by the
door He grabs one from the top and throws it on

He strides into the plant looking around as he walks The
workers ignore him A BIG GUY broad shoulders up ahead

Leon walks right up to him He turns the Big Guy around

He’s not Mahogany The Big Guy scowls but turns away

Leon reaches a work sink It’s full of BLOODY TOOLS being
washed clean by a constant flow of water He glances
behind Nobody’s watching him

Next to the sink is an apronwork belt hanging from a hook
on the wall Another look back at the Workers to see what
he can use to fit in Each has a belt with one or two
tools

Picking and choosing Leon takes a short knife and a
pointed tool that looks like an awl He puts the belt on
and tries wearing the tools The belt droops so he drops
the awl and keeps only the knife and belt He sees an old
pair of work goggles He fixes the strap to fit him and
he puts them on

Then Leon grabs a bloody cleaver and hefts it Keeps it

Suddenly somebody shoves him out of the way He’s ready to
defend himself but it’s just another butcher putting his
tools in the sink The other butcher wonders if he knows
him

Leon just stares back offering a little nod The butcher
nods back Leon backs away armed

Leon takes a meat hook from the sink and hangs it on his
belt next to his knife Then he lifts the bloody meat
cleaver

INT MAIN PACKING FLOOR - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS 92

Leon walks with determination knife and meat hook clanking
on his belt cleaver in his hand Just ahead he sees the

INT SUBWAY CAR - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS 93

Maya sits in a nearly empty car Only three people with
her Two are street punks with lacquered hair one a crew
cut the other a spiky doo They stare straight at her
Weird twins

The third is an oddball with round glasses He wears a
three-piece brown suit which seems too tight He carries a
well-worn sample case Maya gives him a hard look
wondering

He doesn’t look like Leon’s photos of Mahogany but he
looks too muscular to be a salesman Maybe the suit is
just tight He gazes at her then looks away Maya keeps
an eye on him

Suddenly there is a shrill sound of brakes The train
slows

Maya jerks in her seat as the train comes to a hard stop
None of the other riders moves Then the two punks jump up
and leave the car in one startling motion The door shuts

Maya looks at the man in the brown suit He ignores her

The train starts moving The odd man has no expression

INT SUBWAY CAR -- NIGHT - CONTINUOUS 94

The train goes deeper into the depths of the city Maya
looks around her The car feels like it is going faster

Now the man in the suit stands up He walks right to her
Maya leans back and grabs her purse She digs her hand in

The man stops between Maya and the door He grabs the roof
hand rail Now he stares straight at her Is it a smile

The brakes hiss Slowly the subway car stops Doors
open

The man lets go of the hand rail and steps out of the car
The doors close behind him The car and tracks are silent

Then with another hard jerk the subway starts to roll

The train is empty except for Maya She looks surprised

INT SUBWAY TUNNEL - PLATFORM -- NIGHT - CONTINUOUS 95
Leon butcher tools hanging walks onto an empty platform
There was a station here years ago beneath the meat plant
but all that is left is this platform The overheads are
burnt out but a few bare ones are still lighted

Leon stands totally focused listening for a train

Hearing nothing he opens his coat shifting his tools
Hefts the cleaver Looks down the tunnel Nothing

Then a bare bulb above him starts to blink

INT SUBWAY TRAIN -- NIGHT - CONTINUOUS 96

Maya still sits alone as the car pulls into another
station

The doors hiss open No one boards The doors hiss close

The train clatters out of the station Maya looks outside

The dark walls of a tunnel She leans back but still
tense
INT SUBWAY TUNNEL -- NIGHT - CONTINUOUS 97

Leon watches the bulb flicker Then another bulb flickers
He turns his head listens for any noise Nothing

But down the line --

-- Leon can hear a very quiet rumbling A train is coming

INT SUBWAY TRAIN -- NIGHT - CONTINUOUS 98
Maya turns to the other side but she only sees tunnel
Suddenly -- The overhead light GOES OUT Pitch black

Maya backs into a corner She turns to the next car It’s
dark too The car on the other end just as dark

But several cars down Maya sees light She gets up with a
hand on the wall and walks toward the end of the car

She reaches the door to the next car She takes her wallet
out of her purse and stuffs it in her pocket She takes
out the revolver With a toss she throws her purse down

Maya pulls the door open The next car is dark but the
illuminated car now seems brighter It’s only two cars
away

INT PLATFORM -- NIGHT - CONTINUOUS 99
Leon stands at the very edge of the platform He can hear
the train advancing loudly The noise is actually a
shaking

Leon reacts to the RUMBLING of the train

He stands back a little as the train gets closer But he
knows that the train will not be slowing or stopping at
this old station platform

The engine car barrels past Leon and the train flashes by

Leon moves back to the very edge He tries to look into
the speeding cars but all are now empty He still stares

POV Suddenly a woman leaves one car and enters another

Even in the darkness Leon can see -—-
IT’S MAYA

Leon reacts with horror and has one thought He’1ll just
have to leap on the train He yanks off his belt grips
the meat hook in one hand and wraps the belt around it

The very end of the train is about to pass His last
chance

He psyches himself up then

Jumps up onto the rear of the train snaring an outer hand
rail with the hook The centrifugal force whips him hard
against the end of the train Knocking the wind out of
him

Leon grunts loudly But the hook holds

The train disappears around the curve Leon hanging from
it

INT SUBWAY TRAIN -- NIGHT - CONTINUOUS 100

Maya stops at the door of the dark car just before the lit
car Thru the window she can see five bodies hanging
upside down They swing back-and-forth from both sides of
the aisle making it impossible for Maya to see all the way
to the opposite end of the car

Tightening her grip on the pistol she slides open the
door to -

SUBWAY TRAIN2ND TO LAST CAR - CONTINUOUS 101

The door slams shut behind Maya muffling the subway roar
Her heart pounding Maya pauses all senses focused beyond
the gun that she holds straight out with elbows locked

Nothing moves save the continued swinging of the corpses
The closest one seems to be staring straight at her as she
pushes past it entering the gauntlet of bodies

Above a squeaking sound catches Mayas attention She
glances up Meat hooks have been hung from the same bar
that the commuter straps swing from Each pierces the
Achilles tendon of a corpse The hooks squeak like
playground swings under the weight

Maya look back down Only a couple corpses remain in the
gauntlet She reaches out to push the next one aside but
the moment her hand touches the corpse it begins to thrash
uncontrollably

Shocked Maya falls backwards into the corpse behind her
Landing she snaps her gun up pointing it at the back of
the flailing body Unlike the others this one is still
very much ALIVE

Scrambling to her feet Maya cautiously works her way
around the flailing body Its screaming for all its worth
but the gag in its mouth is rendering it mostly mute

As Maya reaches the front of the corpse she suddenly
lowers her gun staring in disbelief And from behind his
gag JURGIS stops screaming returning Mayas stare

Standing on the rear porch of the train his face pressed
to the window Leon watches Mahogany heft the now hairless
body over his shoulder With his free hand Mahogany grabs
the handle of his tool bag and turns toward the next subway

In one of Leons hands is the meat hook With the other he
reaches for the door handle and turns it It doesnt budge
The door is LOCKED

Arms shaking Maya tries to lift Jurgis leg up off the
meat hook Her hands are wet with Jurgis blood Suddenly
the ankle slips from Mayas hands and yanks to a stop
against the meat hook its still impaled on Jurgis grits
his teeth trying not to scream in agony

Maya reaches to try again but her hand barely touches the
ankle when Jurgis starts screaming for all hes worth Maya
looks down at Jurgis Jurgis eyes are wide with horror
She turns following his gaze to-

Mahogany stands for a moment staring at Maya thru the
window between the two cars and then hes sliding the door
open and moving quickly down the car toward her

Maya fumbles the gun out of her pants aims and just
before Mahogany reaches her pulls the trigger

BANG Hearing the gunshot a panicked Leon begins slamming
the meat hook into the window glass again and again

INT SUBWAY CARLAST CAR - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS 106

Mahogany lifts a flattened bullet from between the chinks
in his chain metal apron And smiles

Maya raises the gun to shoot again but before she can pull
the trigger Mahogany swings the body hes been lugging
over his shoulder around like a human baseball bat
sending Maya flying back into the gauntlet of corpses Her
gun hits the floor and disappears beneath the seats

Calmly Mahogany opens his bag of tools and removes a
butchering knife

Maya looks up as Mahogany moves toward her As he passes
Jurgis Mahogany brings the knife down sharply opening him
waist to neck Blood spills from Jurgis torso but Mahogany
doesnt so much as break stride as continues toward Maya

Suddenly the door behind Mahogany flies open-

JURGIS
MAHOGANY

Mahogany turns Leon stands in the doorway the meat hook
in his hand

He rushes toward the two ferocious totally enraged He
grabs Mahogany by his arms and pulls him back Maya pushes
from beneath With a push Mahogany shakes Leon and lands
on Maya hard almost breaking her legs She screams

Now Leon bangs Mahogany’s head with the hammer he kept and
Mahogany pushes him back with a big hand Leon shouts

LEON
Let her go

Leon pounds Mahogany as hard as he can and now he
flinches

LEON
(to Maya)
Get away

Maya crawls away from the fighting men and pulls herself
up looking for some way to help Leon Leon reacts to
this and Mahogany uses the moment to slam Leon hard onto
the floor

Maya goes for her gun and points it at Mahogany He pulls
Leon in front of him and Maya moves around to find a clear
shot at Mahogany’s head The wrestling makes it difficult
She slams Mahogany hard with the handle He doesn’t feel
it

Mahogany grabs Leon’s hammer and holding Leon down he
pounds Leon hard in the forehead Leon slumps and
Mahogany grabs Maya with one big hand He hurls her
against the wall

Maya crumples and Leon moans in shock Mahogany hits him
again and pulls him toward the car with the hanging meat

They reach the car door and Mahogany gives Leon’s head a
bang on the glass before he pulls the car door open

Leon absorbing the blow pulls Mahogany away from the
door He grabs Mahogany’s leg and decks him with a
schoolyard trip

Leon pulls himself off the floor and shakes off his pain
with a shudder and he takes out the cleaver left on his
belt

Mahogany gets back up and Leon races forward to meet the
butcher the two men raising their weapons

Mahogany lifts his hammer with a two handed grip Leon
waves the cleaver

They clash like gladiators Sparks fly as metal meets
metal

It’s a brutal conflict made all the more chaotic by the
swaying of the train and the presence of the corpses
which each man uses in turn as a shield

Mahogany’s hammer then Leon’s cleaver strike the corpses -
Digging deep within there flesh Severing limbs with single
strokes

The men fall back on one of the buckets - human blood is
overturned The combatants try not to slide on the gore
slicked floor

Mahogany swings his hammer - Leon ducks The hammer
strikes the wall beside the door

THE AUTOMATIC DOOR MECHANISM ERUPTS IN A SHOWER OF SPARKS
THE DOORS OPEN

The wall of the tunnel speeds by dangerously close to the
two men The sounds of wheels on the track increases

The train lurches picking up speed
CRASH The hammer crushes the seat next to Leons head

Mahogany comes after Leon like a juggernaut smashing
corpses left and right

Leon’s feet slide in the blood He falls to the ground
Mahogany sees his chance He raises the hammer above Leon --

BANG Maya back on her feet gun in hand fires at
Mahogany

Mahogany cringes The shot hit his foot He grabs Maya
before falling over and he throws her across the car

Maya slams against a wall knocked out but still moving

Leon sees Maya moving and reaches for Mahogany’s hammer
Mahogany recovering slams it down just missing Leon

The hammer smashes a hole in the floor of the train which
gets bigger when Mahogany pulls it out

Leon swings his cleaver but it’s knocked out of his hand by
Mahogany’s hammer

Leon kicks Mahogany’s gunshot leg and Mahogany drops his
hammer to the ground

INT SUBWAY TRAIN -- NIGHT - SAME 107

His hammer gone Mahogany grabs Leon’s neck and starts
choking him struggling to kill him by cutting off his air

Leon kicks Mahogany away with a final burst of strength
The lights in the train flicker on and off Electricity
from the tracks pours up from the hole in the floor

Getting back his air Leon throws himself hard at Mahogany

Mahogany standing on his strong leg absorbs the blow He
pulls a serrated blade from beneath his chain mail and
launches toward Leon Leon ducks grabbing Mahogany’s
hand

Mahogany rips his hand free and stabs Leon in the arm He
is just grazed and Leon counters by throw himself at
Mahogany

Mahogany loses his balance and falls back He puts his
knife out to anchor himself and his blade hits a hanging
carcass

The carcass groans It’s Jurgis the blade embedded in
him

Mahogany yanks the knife out and rips half of Jurgis’s
chest

A sickened Leon grabs Mahogany and pulls him down on the
car floor close to the open car door The rock face races
past

Leon throws himself on Mahogany’s legs pushing him
further Mahogany swings out inches from the rock wall
The wall is inches from Mahogany’s skull He struggles to
hang on

INT SUBWAY TRAIN - OPEN DOORWAY - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS 108
Leon pushes harder bracing himself against the open door

Mahogany panics He’s inches from losing the top of his
head he slashes his knife at Leon Then-

A sickening sound as Mahogany is hit hard by a protruding
metal beam which the train hurtles past His body jerks as
the beam continues to tear at him His hands drop to his
sides His body slides out the door falling from the
train

Leon gets to his feet He grabs Maya and shakes her back
to full consciousness then he holds them both safe by
using a strap to support them They’re inches from the
hanging meat She grabs him back holding him tight

They both realize the train is beginning to slow down

It slows to a crawl

INT SUBWAY TRAIN - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS 109

Leon checks Maya to make sure she is okay and they
embrace both glad to be alive They both think of Jurgis

MAYA
Jurgis Oh no please

Both rush to the hanging Jurgis and Maya starts crying
when she sees the body ripped by Mahogany’s knife Leon
pulls her away but he’s shocked by the sight of Jurgis’
ripped corpse

Then the slowing train alerts them

They are coming to the end of the line

Leon looks out the windows On one side of the train - to
Leon’s shock - the tunnel wall has disappeared Darkness

A few yards beyond the track the rock face falls away
Darkness Leon looks out the door looks down Darkness

Everything falls into darkness He can’t tell how far
LEON
Christ
EXT SUBWAY TRAIN -- NIGHT - CONTINUOUS 110

The train is stopped at the bottom of a deep cavern Pitch
black but immense the train a tiny shape in the gloom

The ceiling arches above but it’s too dark to see how
high

The cavern itself is littered with skulls and bony decay a
boneyard going back centuries strewn with crumbling
remains

All is totally still

INT SUBWAY TRAIN -- NIGHT - CONTINUOUS 111
Leon and Maya look into the darkness too dark to see

Behind them there is the noise of another door

The Driver enters the car from the rear He looks at Leon
then he surveys the chaos in the train He’s obviously
unfazed by the bloodshed He sees that Mahogany is gone

DRIVER

He didn’t have what it takes
anymore But he gave them
everything he could He knew it
must be done It was a
privilege

(sincerely)
I envy you

Leon reacts rage contorting his face

DRIVER

Before you were born Before
anyone living was born Before
the city was thought of That’s
how long or longer And you have
found them As only a few before
you The small circle We keep
the secret and we preserve them

LEON
Who are you

DRIVER
A servant

LEON
You’re a killer like him

DRIVER

A killer No I keep the worlds
separate You’ll understand
They’re coming now

LEON
I’1l kill you if I have to

DRIVER
The Fathers They’re coming
The builders and rulers of the
city
The Driver just stares at Leon calmly looking at Mahogany

Then the Driver clicks off the lights of the car

DRIVER
Dont stand by the meat

Then--

INT SUBWAY TUNNEL - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS 112
A SKITTERING NOISE IN THE DARKNESS

Leon and Maya look out and see shapes moving toward them
The shapes look the size of men and they move like they
are bipedal But they are much heavier and low slung

Then a noise of something on the train Leon sees the
first shape as it boards It’s head is monstrous
leathery with four rows of teeth Huge eyes much too
large for its head

EXT SUBWAY TRAIN -- NIGHT - CONTINUOUS 113

Leon pulls Maya out of the car and they both drop down
outside They can make out a line of the shapes
approaching like a dark wave The things board the car
and ignore them

They watch as the corpses in the car begin to bobble
obscenely - being readied for their destination

With numerous uneven thuds the corpses drop down and Leon
and Maya hear them being dragged across the dark subway
car

Then a shuffling noise can be heard outside the car this
time its the sound of the bodies being pulled along The
shuffling recedes in quiet waves and finally all is
silent

Leon looks on the car for the Driver He’s gone The
train is plunged in darkness - there’s no sign of him
anywhere Maya cringes and grabs hold of Leon’s hand He
reaches down and sees a pile of human bones There are
skulls and remains all around The leavings of several
centuries of feeding

Leon kneels down and surveys the chaos of bones dry skulls
and still-fleshy heads of those who surrendered here Some
are so life-like it seems they might speak of the horror

Leon approaches a pile of skulls which seem to forma
circle

Suddenly one skull comes to life It’s a still-living
head and it moves out from the circle of skulls and dead
men

It’s Mahogany The top of his head is shorn off His eyes
are bloodshot and furious

Leon steps back startled but it’s not an hallucination

INT SUBWAY TUNNEL - CAVERN - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS 114
SUDDENLY -- MAHOGANY STRIKES AT LEON WITH HIS CLEAVER

Leon grabs a bone and raises it above his head for
protection It shatters under the weight of the cleaver

Leon struggles to his feet Still holding the SHATTERED
BONE

Mahogany reaches out for him Leon is barely able to stay
on his feet He sees a sight which startles him

Mahogany’s apron is gone his shirt is torn apart from the
crash In the middle of Mahogany’s chest is a wound - like
Leon’s - but much larger spanning his chest cavity It’s
deteriorating crusted and scarred

Mahogany sees Leon’s reaction and stares coldly Leon
steps back and grabs Maya pulling her up and pushing her
away

Then behind them in the darkness there is movement We
do not see it but something is circling the walls

Saliva runs from Mahogany’s gaping mouth He lunges at
Leon swinging savagely But this time Mahogany misses

Leon spins around sinking the shattered bone into
Mahogany’s side Mahogany roars in pain and comes at Leon
in a blind fury the bone still stuck in his side

Mahogany comes after Leon with the cleaver a third time
Leon ducks the blow and reaches for the bone in Mahogany’s
side HE PULLS IT OUT

Blood and flesh pour from the wound
Mahogany hits Leon in the head with the flat side of the
cleaver Opening up a wound in his head Leon hits the

ground hard

Mahogany charges toward Leon Cleaver in hand Leon just
gets back to his feet as--

Mahogany swings - cutting the air with precision Leon
steps back but not fast enough--

THE BLADE BURIES ITSELF IN LEON’S SHOULDER It sticks in
the bone

Leon uses the agonizing moment to his advantage He still
grips the shattered bone in his hand Its tip as sharp as a
needle

The momentum of swinging the cleaver having carried
Mahogany slightly past Leon Leon drives the broken bone
into the back of Mahoganys neck with all his might

Mahogany gags A rasping choking sounds come out of his
throat Blood bubbles out of his mouth Out from around
the tip of the bone that now juts from between Mahoganys
teeth like a white demonic tongue Leon has driven the bone
all the way thru Mahoganys neck and into his mouth

Mahogany pulls the bone out of his neck A thin stream of
blood pulses across the ground He presses his hand there
trying to slow the loss of blood

Leon stands as Mahogany sinks to his knees Leons face
contorts with victory He’s beaten him But now Leon
falls He is wounded and exhausted He hits the ground on
his knees

Mahogany turns his face up to Leon There is no trace of
fear in his eyes - only relief A smile twists his lips

Leon’s eyes flicker with hate Mahogany spits gurgling
trying to form words

MAHOGANY
Welcome

Mahogany begins to choke on his own blood laughing and
coughing at the same time

Leons gloating fades He looks around and there is no
sign of Maya The dark cavern is silent She is just
gone

LEON
Maya

Mahogany’s hand loosens on his wound blood trickling down

Leon tries to get up but his effort is just a stumble He
just looks around and repeats Maya’s name

LEON
Maya

Leon shudders from his own injuries still on his knees
Hearing the crunch of feet approaching he looks-up to see
several Fathers closing on him

Not wanting to end-up like the meat on the train Leon
scrambles backwards thru the bones that litter the cavern
floor then grabbing hold of the cleaver still embedded in
his shoulder he yanks it free Blood from the newly opened
wound instantly soaks his shirt

Leon starts to raise the cleaver in defense but the clawed
hand of a Father grabs his wrist from behind Leon turns
There are more Fathers behind him Hes surrounded

The cleaver falls to the ground as the Fathers lift Leon
to his feet Hes too weak to even think about fighting
them off Hes held up arms outstretched arms like a
scarecrows

Another clawed hand grabs Leons chin and forces his face
to turn sharply left Leon has no choice but watch as
several Fathers pass carrying Mahoganys now naked body
They drop Mahogany to the floor and step back

Just beyond Mahoganys body is absolute darkness save the
random highlights cast by the torches of the Fathers
And then these highlights begin to move What appeared
initially to be just a cavern wall is actually the skin of
a being so massive that it fills the cavern floor-to-
ceiling and continues away from Leon and the Fathers to
an unknowable depth The bits of skin visible are darkish
in color smooth in texture although thin enough to reveal
the massive muscles that ripple beneath and consistently
wet This is the Grandfather

LEON
My God

From the darkness one of the Grandfathers arms emerges
and grabbing hold of Mahoganys head suddenly yanks his
body up

For a split second the Grandfathers mouth is visible
as it opens wide and then as Mahogany disappears inside
its swallowed again by darkness The only evidence
Mahogany ever existed is the crunching of his bones

Leon freaks Struggles with all he has left to escape but
the Fathers force him to his knees And from the
darkness two of the Grandfathers arms emerge Between
them is Maya She is hanging a couple feet off the ground
naked and porcelain white

Whether she is alive is unclear at this moment but what is
clear is that Leon has never seen something so beautiful
She hangs in the darkness like an angel

LEON
Maya

Maya’s eyes open And stare down into Leon’s

LEON
Maya can you hear me

A peaceful smile creases Maya’s lips

MAYA
Leon this is what you’ve been
looking for

And from the void behind Maya two more of the
“Grandfather’s” arms emerge They wrap themselves around
either side of Maya meeting in the middle of her chest

LEON
Let her go Take me

The Grandfather’s finders sink easily into the flesh of
Maya’s chest like a baker’s into dough

LEON
LET HER GO

And then almost tenderly the hands pull back There is a
moment of resistance and then with the faintest of CRACKS
her rib cage separates and her entire torso opens
revealing the organs within There is no blood Just the
play of the “Father’s” torch light on her motionless heart

LEON
No no Maya

Leon bows his head completely broken When he looks back
up the Driver is standing over him

DRIVER
And now to serve in silence

The “Fathers” step back from the Driver and Leon
The Driver pulls Leon’s mouth open and forces his hand into

Leon’s mouth and rips out Leon’s tongue Blood cascades
from Leon’s mouth

The Driver holds Leon’s tongue up presenting it to Leon
Then he throws it into the mass of “Fathers” The dark
mass absorbs it

Slowly Leon’s breathing recovers and becomes less labored
more controlled The breathing then becomes measured
even It almost becomes normal breathing with a slight
trembling

Somehow rising to his feet Leon moves his head toward the
still hovering Maya and the Driver lets him close the
distance to her Her face is almost frozen now but Leon
continues to move closer

Now he is face to face with her and he moves his bloody
lips to kiss her She remains fixed like a statue as he
begins a blood kiss pressing his lips hard on hers

Suddenly Maya seems to come alive with blood from Leons
mouth running

Mayas body arches back her chest cavity opening up
further almost like wings She gives Leon a skeletal
embrace which he receives in winder his eyes becoming
fixed cold icy

INT MAHOGANY’S APARTMENT - BATHROOM -- DAY 115

A shrill metallic screech Bad plumbing A hand turns a
faucet off old water pipes a moldy bathroom

The hand reaches up to straighten a tie A modest brown
suit Clean We see shoulders It’s fit perfectly

A suit identical to the neatly-pressed one worn by
Mahogany Now we see cuff links neat like Mahogany’s cuff
links And on the wrist a twisted silver bracelet with a
moon

INT MAHOGANY’S APARTMENT - MAIN ROOM - DAY - CONTINUOUS 116

Weve seen this room before It’s the main room of
Mahogany’s apartment There is someone in the chair

It’s Detective Hodge She is watching a news report on the
small television

ANCHOR WOMAN
- apparently she acquired an
automatic pistol before her
disappearance

(MORE )

ANCHOR WOMAN (contd)
The police say Ms Jones and Mr
Tompkins are only missing at this
point although foul play has not
been ruled out

And now the man in the neat suit stands before the set
watching the report with Hodge

It’s Leon But virtually a spitting image for Mahogany

He shows no interest in the news and faces Hodge She
gives him the once-over then turns back to the television
She reaches behind and yanks the plug The set blinks off

Leon goes to an old desk and leans over something we cannot
see at first As he leans over it we recognize the BLACK

VALISE He takes out several corkscrew tools and inspects

them THE LID OF THE VALISE SLOWLY CLOSES ON ITS OWN

Leon steps up to the hallway door he picks up a BLACK
LEATHER BAG from the floor We hear a quiet metallic
clatter Engraved on the leather is the name “Mahogany”

Leon pauses and cocks his head
Hodge now stands right behind Leon and she takes a leather

datebook out of her coat and presents it to him It is the
same datebook which Hodge took from Maya

Leon holds the book a minute glances at its contents then
stuffs it inside his coat He opens the outer door

A uniformed cop has his back to us in the doorway but he
moves to let Leon pass And now the cop shuts the door
INT SUBWAY TRAIN - NIGHT 117

It’s late We follow Leon dressed in his suit leather
bag in one hand as he walks the aisle of an empty car

His stride is purposeful He leaves one car enters the
next We follow him through a second empty car No one

CLACK He slides open the door to a third car and enters
This car is also empty Except one lone passenger --

THE YOUNG MAN FROM THE PROLOGUE
The young man leans back in his seat sleeping unaware

LEON PASSES RIGHT BY THE YOUNG MAN SEEMING TO IGNORE HIM

Leon opens the door to the next car He stops turns
Leon looks back a second Now he goes through the door

CLACK -- THE CAR DOOR SLAMS SHUT BEHIND HIM
