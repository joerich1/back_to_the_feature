lunges forward

He tackles the sumptuous sexy VICKY AMADO and throws her onto the four-
poster bed in the midst of their pillow fight The bedroom is absurdly
javieh and little-girlish with immense teddy bears and a carousel pany
They flail across the bed giggling lovers The immediate impression is
One of sumptuous decay the colors vivid primry almet riotous

TONY
You pampered white-assed hitch

VICKY
You pimple-faced toad

He mniles famous of course far his acne ami reptilian eyes but there is a
courtliness a certain mildness of manner that is at once beguiling ani
threatening

to resist but Vickys hreasts are hovering over his face taking his
attention

VICKY
