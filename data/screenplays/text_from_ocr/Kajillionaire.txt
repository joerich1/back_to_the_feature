EXT BUS STOPPOST OFFICE - AFTERNOON 1

Four or five unrelated people are waiting for the bus
looking at phones bored The bus comes blocking our view of
the bus stop for a moment Credit supers over the poster on
the side of the bus

KAJILLIONAIRE

When the bus leaves only three of the (seemingly unrelated)
people are left a woman with very long hair (late 50s
THERESA) a young woman with very long hair (late 20s OLD
DOLIO) and an older man (60s ROBERT) standing reading a
folded newspaper

Theresa glances at her watch

THERESA
(without turning her head)
15 seconds

ROBERT
After this person

A woman exits the POST OFFICE the bus stop is in front of

ROBERT (CONTD)
Clear

THERESA
Not clear

Another person walks by We see now that there’s a
surveillance camera on the area mounted on the post office
From that camera’s POV they look like strangers all oriented
in different directions even as they talk to each other

THERESA (CONTD)
Go-

ROBERT
(interrupting)
NO

Another person passes

THERESA
NOW

The coast is perfectly clear
Old Dolio suddenly dives towards the post office rolling on

the ground now sliding against a wall - this is intercut
with the post office’s surveillance cameras as they swivel
But she has clearly been doing this for years and knows
exactly how to avoid detection Now she seems to walk around
something invisible abruptly turning sideways now ducking
as if there was something overhead She rolls into the post
office

CUT TO

INT POST OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 2

Old Dolio quickly unlocks an empty PO box and looks through
the hole to the interior of the post office All the
employees are just leaving holding lunches The remaining
worker does something routine (like stamping envelopes) that
turns him away Old Dolio waits for this and then silently
reaches her arm through the box reaching around to the PO
box next to hers and taking their mail a slim package (It’s
possible you have to be double jointed to do this stunt
double) She takes the mail on the other side as well
stashing it all in the backpack that she’s wearing backwards
over her stomach Old Dolio’s long center-parted hair looks
like it’s never been cut paired with her baggy clothes and
the way she carries herself this reads as butch though she’s
unlikely to have ever considered her sexuality She moves to
another PO box

CUT TO

EXT POST OFFICE - AFTERNOON 3

Robert and Theresa casually start walking down the street as
strangers single file Theresa has a slight limp A moment
later Old Dolio falls in behind them Her face has been
nearly blank the whole time Now they walk together in a
group They are the Dyne Family

EXT ALLEY - AFTERNOON 4

They pause in an alley and pull envelopes and small packages
out of Old Dolio’s backpack They talk over each other to
themselves

THERESA
(opening an envelope)
Cash No - a money order Twenty

Old Dolio opens a small package it’s a wrapped gift with one
of those round pre-made bows consisting of many loops She
tries to untie the bow pulls on one end and the whole thing
rapidly unwinds into one long ribbon the length of her arm
She looks at it with confusion and throws it on the ground
rips off the wrapping paper It’s a stuffed animal
(Overlapping dialogue)

OLD DOLIO
They have these atI have a
receipt that’ll

She takes out a small photo wallet and flips through a
collection of receipts to find one that looks like it could
be for the stuffed animal

OLD DOLIO (CONT’D)
(reads a receipt from
Target)
“Toys and games 1299” Target
Easy return

Robert is opening a slim package it’s a tie He looks at it
carefully

ROBERT
This is not a cheap tie

Old Dolio studies the tie

ROBERT (CONTD)

You can’t see it because you’re not
of gentle birth But I put this on

(he puts it on)
and the nobility knows I’m one of
them Good day my lord

(he makes a fancy gesture)
At ease

(claps his hands more

gestures)
That was a good one - what did I
just say I don’t even know

OLD DOLIO
“Good day my lord”

ROBERT
No it was better than that - I had
aHm Lost forever now

CUT TO

EXT NICE STREET THIRTY MINUTES LATER 5

The three of them are walking with urgency passing other
people on this busy street
They pass a paper shopping bag Robert kicks it gently to
make sure it’s empty nothing of value inside Old Dolio
verifies this by picking it up and ferociously ripping it
apart as she walks

ROBERT
Empty

As he says this Old Dolio throws it down quickly in
agreement still walking They walk looking for
opportunities Robert suddenly walks backwards to a fancy-
looking spa-type place He takes off his watch and puts it
in his pocket Heads in patting his new tie

CUT TO

INT MED-SPA NEXT MOMENT 6

Robert strolls up to the front desk with quiet confidence
he’s playing a character There are women waiting on little
chairs One passes by in a robe The receptionist has
luscious lips maybe filled

ROBERT
(in a noble voice)
I’m Robert

RECEPTIONIST
Sorry I -
ROBERT
I left my watch when I was getting

my
(he looks around has no
idea what is done here)
service Maybe it was someone
else I talked to

The Receptionist is drawing a blank

ROBERT (CONTD)
Is there a lost and found

RECEPTIONIST
Ok one sec

She bends down to look around in lower shelves While she’s
down there Robert scans the counter He takes a few mints a
pen and a whole bunch of pumps of a sample lotion -- it’s
too much for his hands he quickly rubs it on his stomach
under his shirt as she comes up
A8

RECEPTIONIST (CONTD)
We don’t have a lost and found But
if I could get your name and -

CUT TO

EXT NICE STREET A MINUTE LATER 7

As Robert catches up to Old Dolio and Theresa a group of
“real men” passes him they’re wearing ties one has a
newspaper under his arm Robert looks nervously down he
knows this kind of man can see he’s just a freak This is
just chatter in passing maybe not even really heard

REAL MAN
Sometimes I ask myself “Is it my
fault”

The other men shake their heads no

REAL MAN (CONTD)
Is there something I’m not seeing
I don’t think so

ROBERT
Disgusting in there Women parading
around in bathrobes with swollen
(gestures to the lips)

THERESA
They’re trying to look post-coital

Old Dolio is grossed out at the thought of this They keep
walking - determined a little desperate eyes crawling over
everything

EXT LANKERSHIM BLVD 30 MINUTES LATER A8

Old Dolio dips her finger into the change return of an old
payphone nothing She rejoins the others still walking
Suddenly there is an earthquake not a huge one just a
tremor These happen all the time so everyone ignores it the
other people on the street keep walking only glancing around
slightly But the Dynes all freeze as if a bomb has gone off
People walk past them After a moment they recover and keep
walking Theresa nods towards a ATHLETIC CLUB On his way in
Robert steals a newspaper from a box by giving it a special
double tug He jogs inside

CUT TO
INT ATHLETIC CLUB NEXT MOMENT
Robert is mid-conversation with the FRONT DESK CLERK

FRONT DESK CLERK
I’1l take a look

He looks in a box

FRONT DESK CLERK (CONT’D)
There is a watch here

The clerk looks Robert up and down Robert smiles

ROBERT
Should I describe it It’s a Rolex
It’s submersible

FRONT DESK CLERK
(with a sly look)
What’s the inscription say

ROBERT
(pause chuckle)
Trick question you can’t inscribe
Rolex - they’re backed with
tungsten carbide

FRONT DESK CLERK
There is an inscription

ROBERT
(not missing a beat)
Oh then it definitely isn’t mine

The clerk pulls out the watch a glittering Rolex A tiny
flicker in Robert’s eyes bingo

ROBERT (CONTD)
(reaching out)

I wonder how they did that
(glances flips it over
hands back)

Ah it’s not submersible that’s

how

A female clerk appears and Robert clocks her name tag
CHRISTINA

FRONT DESK CLERK
Sorry sir If I can get your name -

CUT TO
EXT LANKERSHIM A MINUTE LATER 9

Robert and Old Dolio wait as Theresa talks on a cheap yellow
smart phone

THERESA
(now in a patrician voice)
May I speak to Christina

They are all quiet focused on her

THERESA (CONTD)

(into phone)
Yes my husband lost his watchhe
was on a treadmill and he says he
took it off to - a Rolex Oh thank
goodness Yes of course

(reading off the phone Old

Dolio is holding up)
“For Victor with love until the end
of time Althea”isn’t that the
sweetest—

(pause)
The date

She looks at Robert urgently he shakes his head - he has no
idea None of them breathe Theresa looks caught - what can
she do but guess

THERESA (CONTD)
Valentine’s Day
(exhale)
Thank you so much for keeping it
safe My daughter will be right
over she’s right near by

Theresa hangs up relieved but shaken

ROBERT
I didn’t see a date I don’t think
there was-

THERESA
Fuck you

Old Dolio looks quickly to Robert hoping he won’t let her
get away with that But he’s quietly anxious watching
Theresa Old Dolio quickly pulls up her pant over her knees
and pulls on a coat-with-dress-front-panel on over the top
transforming her look

She tightens the belt around her waist as she heads towards
to the Athletic Club -- Robert stops her counts silently a
few beats and then motions for her to continue

CUT TO

EXTINT ATHLETIC CLUB TEN MINUTES LATER 10

Through the windows we see Old Dolio in her dress talking to
Christina and then walking away with the watch As she
leaves the original Front Desk Clerk watches her with a
flicker of confusion as he helps another guest Old Dolio
has sensed this suspicion and walks quickly past Robert and
Theresa and then breaks into a run Without skipping a beat
Robert and Theresa run too There is a choreographed
serpentine elegance to their running that perhaps involves
Old Dolio and Robert doubling back every little while so they
don’t leave limping Theresa

As they run Old Dolio hands off the watch to Robert They
talk while running

OLD DOLIO
(worried)
We can’t pawn it Not with the
inscription
ROBERT
Clearly
OLD DOLIO

So we give it to Stovik directly
Robert says nothing they run

OLD DOLIO (CONT’D)
It’s worth three months rent maybe
more - we could even get caught up

ROBERT
(tapping his head)
Use the ticker Old Dolio

Theresa cackles seems to understand the plan
OLD DOLIO
(mumbling)
The ticker’s the heart

ROBERT
What

OLD DOLIO
(poking her heart)
The ticker

ROBERT
Stovik won’t acceptno you found
it on your way home from school
and you’re a good girl so you’ll -

OLD DOLIO
Ok right I’ll return it -

EXT LANKERSHIM BUS STOP - DAY 11

Now they’ve all joined at a bus stop They all note a
surveillance camera and assume positions as strangers again
as in the opening scene not looking at each other as they
talk

ROBERT
To its rightful owners Who will be
very grateful Your typical
finder’s fee is 10 percent of total
value of the - they might not know
that but -

THERESA
(reading from the yellow
phone)
“Victor and Althea Young 4305 Fair
Glen Road” Ladera Heights

Theresa puts the yellow phone on the bench Robert picks it
up and clicks it into the holster on his belt alongside a
brick phone

THERESA (CONTD)
The two goes right there from here

All three of them look at the cheap digital watches on their
wrists They still are not looking at each other seem
unrelated

ROBERT
Do the Catholic schoolgirl costume -
you got some heartstrings to pull

Old Dolio looks in her backpack
OLD DOLIO

I don’t have it But I can pull
heartstrings in this

Robert and Theresa say nothing clearly they don’t think so

ROBERT
We’ll have go home and grab it God
damn it

A NORMAL WOMAN joins them at the bus stop She’s caught the
end of this keeps looking back and forth trying to figure
out if these people know each other

NORMAL WOMAN
(to Old Dolio)
Is he bothering you

Old Dolio just looks away nervously The Normal Woman gives
Robert the eye

NORMAL WOMAN (CONTD)
I don’t think she wants to talk to
you

The Normal Woman stands firm and catches Theresa’s eye and
gives her a nod of solidarity believing they are three women
standing up to a creep A bus pulls up and everyone moves to
get on

CUT TO

EXT THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD A LITTLE LATER 12

The three hurry past old office buildings and factories
there is a quietly churning factory-sound in the air One of
the phones on Robert’s holster pings it’s Theresa’s yellow
smart phone he hands it to her

THERESA
(reading from the phone)
We won the Vitafusion giveaway
under six names today

Theresa’s shirt says Vitafusion They have enough free tee
shirts to never have to do laundry - always in an extra
large inadvertently kind of hip-hop They pass a fat young
pregnant woman (KELLI 20s) who is making out with a WORKER
at the industrial yard they are passing (he’s on a break)
She has a purple folder and is reluctantly pulling away - she
has to be somewhere

Theresa’s voice drops to a whisper as they near the
industrial yard she stops talking completely and they
silently limbo under the yard’s long gate Once they’re clear
of it

THERESA (CONTD)
(whispering)
a 200Z sport water bottle

Robert very quietly unlocks a door a few feet down from the
gate an adjoining building Old Dolio goes inside While
Robert and Theresa are waiting for her they try not to look
at Kelli and the Worker down the street making out Whoops
now the Worker sees them and is clearly saying something
about them to Kelli

Old Dolio comes out dressed in a grey pleated skirt a white
shirt a striped tie and a vest with a collegiate-looking
patch They silently limbo back under the gate But just
then

KELLI
(to the Dynes yelling)
HEY Hey I have a job

Kelli looks back and the Worker nods yes The Dynes cringe
as they sneak along - but it’s no use STOVIK the boss of
the industrial yard looks over the gate The Dynes are just
right there busted

STOVIK
February March April

He’s very stern but he seems to be having some inner struggle
that’s not unfamiliar to the Dynes

ROBERT
We may need to pay in installments

STOVIK
That’s not - rent is installments
It’s monthly installments

His eyes are brimming with tears The Dynes have seen this
before so they say nothing Now tears are running down
Stovik’s mean face Kelli looks concerned

KELLTI
Are you ok

STOVIK
(gesturing to face
angrily)

It’s my condition

ROBERT
He has a -

STOVIK
(to Kelli)
I have no filters so everything
comes in Their fear their
anxietyI have to override it
(he gathers himself
together becomes overly
harsh)
You’re evicted Out now

Old Dolio looks genuinely scared

ROBERT
(quickly)
Well have it in the morning
February March April All 1500
(gestures to Kelli)
We were just talking about a job

OLD DOLIO
Just right now

KELLTI
(doing the math)
You only pay 500 a month

THERESA
But it leaks

STOVIK
It’s very manageable It leaks on a
schedule

Reminded the Dynes all check their watches again

STOVIK (CONT’D)
(nodding)
You patting down the wall
afterwards Dampness becomes rot
The whole building falls down very
expensive

Kelli squints up into the sun to see the name on the
building “BUBBLES INC” And back to Stovik’s tear-streamed
face as he looks at all of them

STOVIK (CONTD)
Oh god

He’s overwhelmed with feeling can’t override it He pulls
his head in

STOVIK (CONTD)
(choking)
See you in the morning

ROBERT
See you in

Stovik stumbles away The Dynes walk on headed to return
the watch Kelli hurries after them encouraged by the Worker
in the background

KELLTI

I’m supposed to take this class
it’s a required thing by my
caseworker but I’m kind of in the
midst of something so if she

(points to Old Dolio)
could just go to the Latvian Church
right down there on Riverside
There’s a sign-up sheet she just
writes my name down and a woman
gives her a yellow slip she gives
that to me so I can prove I went
That’s really all

Her eyes catch on Old Dolio’s uniform there’s something
familiar about it The Dynes keep walking Theresa dabs her
nose as if Kelli smells

KELLI (CONTD)
I can pay20 dollars

Robert stops abruptly

ROBERT
(to Old Dolio)
You heard

OLD DOLIO
(whispering)
What about the -

ROBERT
Yeah so hurry up so we can go

Old Dolio balks for a moment she clearly doesn’t like the
slutty look of this girl

KELLI
Thanks

Kelli hands her the blue folder Old Dolio takes it and walks
off toward the church Then doubles back

OLD DOLIO
What’s your name

Kelli smiles - a friend

KELLTI
Kelli What’s your name

OLD DOLIO
For the sign-up sheet

KELLI
Oh Kelli Fain Kelli with an i
Fain is F-A-I-N You don’t even
have to go in just get the yellow
slip and come right back

Old Dolio heads off and Kelli goes back to the Worker

CUT TO

INT LATVIAN CHURCH FOYER A FEW MINUTES LATER 13

Old Dolio joins a short line of people holding blue folders
and signing in on a clipboard and then filing into a small
auditorium She writes “Kelli Fain” and a VOLUNTEER notes her
name and finds a card in a box and makes a check nodding at
Old Dolio

OLD DOLIO
I need a yellow slip

VOLUNTEER
Ok Dorinda can give you that

The volunteer stamps the back of Old Dolio’s hand - a PENGUIN
STAMP - and hands Old Dolio a name tag sticker “Kelli Her
eyes catch on Old Dolio’s uniform there’s something familiar
about it Old Dolio looks around wondering who Dorinda is

VOLUNTEER (CONTD)
She’s inside

A sign on the door reads “Positive Parenting Prenatal to
Eighteen Years” Old Dolio has to enter the auditorium she’s
the last one in doors are closed behind her She puts the
name tag on

1INT AUDITORIUM CONTINUOUS 14

It’s a mixed group many races some pregnant women - many
people look like they were court-ordered to take this class
All of them are wearing name tags

Old Dolio is looking around wildly for Dorinda An
authoritative woman FARIDA (40s) speaks into a mic

FARIDA
Were starting a little late maybe
the time change threw people off
Take a seat please

Old Dolio sees a woman with a clipboard give a yellow slip of
paper to a man As she tries to make her way over to this
woman she realizes she’s the only one still standing Farida
gestures for Old Dolio to take a seat

FARIDA (CONTD)
(to all)
Let’s get started For those of you
who need caseworker receipts
please see Dorinda at the break

There’s no way out so Old Dolio sits down noncommittally

FARIDA (CONTD)
There are handouts coming from both
directions - take one and pass it
down The blue one is the nutrition
cheat sheet I mentioned yesterday
Please look at the pink one it
says “Breast Crawl” at the top

Dorinda is nearby but every time Old Dolio starts to get up
a handout is passed to her and she has to take one and pass
it down like Charlie Chaplin on the assembly line A video
plays on the screen behind Farida

FARIDA (CONTD)
“How can a newborn baby crawl
right Lookseeif she’s
immediately placed on her mothers
abdomen she makes her way to the
breast all by herself Isn’t that
miraculous Now if the baby is
placed on a cot infant mortality
goes up bonding goes down
lactation goes downall that
important stuff we discussed
yesterday

As Farida talks Old Dolio stares at the screen a shockingly
intimate video the tiny newborn baby painstakingly pulling
herself forward Old Dolio is kind of revolted She looks
around with a grimace thinking other people will be too -
but they aren’t The woman next to her is actually moved to
tears by the video Old Dolio can’t believe this She looks
around parents all of them

CUT TO

INT LATVIAN CHURCH AUDITORIUM - THIRTY MINUTES LATER 15

Like everyone else in the room Old Dolio is holding a baby
doll now She’s kind of confused at this point swirling with
information still trying to get the yellow slip and leave

FARIDA
Did everyone practice swaddling
last night

A weak response from the group

FARIDA (CONTD)
Not really Ok pair up let’s see
some nice tight swaddles

As everyone around her pairs off Old Dolio looks for Dorinda
Just then a tough-looking man THE LEOPARD (40s) turns to
her

THE LEOPARD
(reading her name tag)
You have a partnerKelli

He lays out his baby doll on its baby blanket kneeling
awkwardly Old Dolio doesn’t move

THE LEOPARD (CONTD)
I know you put it on the point of
the triangle but do you fold this

up
Old Dolio kneels down
OLD DOLIO
Where’d that woman go who gives out

the yellow slips

They talk as they try to swaddle

THE LEOPARD
Oh yeah she’s around I’m this
close to getting custody but
certain people in my life are
negative and focused on my past
I’m not a gangster by the way Just
a scrubber You don’t believe that

OLD DOLIO
No I do

THE LEOPARD
I think this part tucks in there to
make it real snug

Old Dolio notices his name tag THE LEOPARD

OLD DOLIO
What’s a scrubber

THE LEOPARD

It’s like ahousecleaner Let’s
say you need a house emptied but
you want it done while the people
who live in the house are asleep
you know without them knowing I
can do that for you Not just the
valuables no every last fork
chair toothpick

He reaches into his cargo pants pocket and pulls out a
handful of different kinds of boxes of toothpicks

THE LEOPARD (CONT’D)
Take one They’re always handy

Old Dolio starts to take one toothpick but her gives her a
whole BOX OF TOOTHPICKS

OLD DOLIO
Why would someone want you to do
that

THE LEOPARD
(shrugs )
That’s not my business People have
grudges Maybe they want to scare
someone Show ‘em who’s boss

He holds the swaddled baby doll

THE LEOPARD (CONT’D)
That’s good that’s pretty good
now

(MORE )

THE LEOPARD (CONT’D)
You’re gonna be an out of sight
mom
(pause)
What about me Think I’1l1 be an out
of sight dad

OLD DOLIO
Yeah

CUT TO

EXT BUBBLES INC AN HOUR LATER DUSK 16

Old Dolio walks back from the class with the yellow slip and
folder in hand she’s still deep in thought about the
intimacy she saw there Kelli is waiting The Worker is long
gone back at work

KELLI
Shit girl What’d you do enroll

Old Dolio hands off the folder and yellow receipt takes the
20

KELLI (CONTD)
Whatd I miss

OLD DOLIO
The breast crawl and -

KELLI
Oh yeah I’m gonna do that that’s
cool isn’t it

OLD DOLIO
Nah you don’t want to baby it like
that
(pointing to her belly)

Kelli is surprised Old Dolio strides off

CUT TO

INT DYNE BUILDING A FEW MINUTES LATER 17

A former office filled with ancient empty mauve cubicles
and mauve industrial carpeting They live here There are
lots of goods stockpiled stacks of non-perishable foods and
free tee shirts and Amazon boxes against the walls Various
costumes hang on hangers on one cubicle Everything is pulled
away from the wall on the right side

Robert and Theresa are sitting on the floor cross-legged
they must have been meditating when Old Dolio came in --
she’s ready to leave now she picks up the Rolex and mumbles
sorry

ROBERT
(eyes shut hands on
knees )
It’s too late We wouldn’t be back
in time

Old Dolio looks at her own watch gives up and sits down with
them hands on knees

THERESA
(eyes closed)
Why would it - why would anything
take so long

OLD DOLIO
(eyes closed)
I couldn’t just - it was a class

ROBERT
(eyes closed)
Ah religious “education”

OLD DOLIO
(eyes closed)
No It was aboutswaddling
nutritionstuff for parents

Robert and Theresa say nothing at all After a moment Old
Dolio opens her eyes and keeps them open A tiny act of
rebellion

CUT TO

INT DYNE BUILDING - AN HOUR LATER 18

They are poised in front of the back wall that everything is
pulled away from each holding a bucket All of their digital
watches go off at the same time A moment later a big cloud
of pink foam rapidly bubbles out of the wall in a line - like
a baby spitting up or a dog with rabies Robert runs down
the tarp collecting the foam by scraping his bucket along the
length of the wall but the foam keeps coming so Theresa
runs collecting it the same way and then Old Dolio Each
person runs on into the bathroom where they dump their
bucket onto the drain in the middle of the floor It’s a
workplace bathroom with stalls and multiple sinks

From one of the sinks runs a piece of hose - this must be how
they bathe They know the foam is done for the day they
replace their buckets and pat the wall dry with towels

CUT TO

INT DYNE BUILDING MIDDLE OF THAT NIGHT 19

Old Dolio is lying in her sleeping bag on the floor of her
cubicle listening to some intense and poignant music playing
quietly from the un-smart phone (on speakerphone) it’s lying
on the floor next to her She’s chewing on a toothpick we
see mementos left by whoever worked in this cubicle decades
ago - a “best mom” card and a photo of a boy playing soccer
The music stops for a moment

HOLD RECORDING
Thank you for waiting someone will
be with you shortly

The music resumes After a moment another phone pings (same
sound as last time mail) Old Dolio glances at Theresa’s
yellow smart phone glowing across the room It’s charging on
a big car battery still in Robert’s holster

ACROSS THE ROOM FIVE MINUTES LATER
Old Dolio crouched in the darkness over Theresa’s phone

THERESA
What are you doing

Old Dolio looks up startled Theresa is on her way to the
bathroom and looks strange in the dark

OLD DOLIO
Sorry it dinged and I

Theresa reaches for the yellow phone

OLD DOLIO (CONTD)
We won something big But we can’t
use it
(she reads)
“The Ooh La Luxe Getaway A first
class trip for two to the Big
Apple”

Theresa takes the phone glances at the screen
OLD DOLIO (CONT’D)

I think it’s redeemable for three
non-refundable coach tick -

THERESA
(interrupting)
We can’t fly

OLD DOLIO
(overlap)
I know I said that We can’t use

it
Theresa’s eyes zero in on the toothpick

THERESA
What’s that

OLD DOLIO
A guy gave them to me in the - the
class

She picks up the box -

OLD DOLIO (CONT’D)
Do you want one

Theresa sighs

THERESA
(scholarly)
When a man gives you wood -
anything made out of wood - he’s
saying You give me wood

It takes Old Dolio a sec to imagine what this means She
slowly opens her mouth and takes out the toothpick she’s been
gnawing on Theresa takes the box of toothpicks

THERESA (CONTD)
Ive been to New York

OLD DOLIO
(quick urgency)
We could both go Just us Like
a”“mother daughter getaway

Old Dolio embarrassed to say something this conventional
sort of laughs with preemptive scornbut Theresa is silent
she glances nervously towards where Robert is sleeping

CUT TO

INT DYNE BUILDING 1101 AM THE NEXT DAY 20

Old Dolio empties her bucket of foam Theresa comes limping
in empties hers Robert is patting the wall with towels

They all exit the building Robert and Theresa in their big
free tee shirts Theresa wearing the Rolex Old Dolio is in
the school uniform

EXT THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD CONTINUOUS 21

They start to limbo under Stovik’s gate but he immediately
leans over them Stovik glances at his watch - 1103am He’s
wearing sunglasses

STOVIK
Did you pat it down

They nod Theresa hands him a manila envelope He opens it
some cash and the money order Tears are leaking out he
wipes them away brusquely

ROBERT
The rest is coming - we’re on our
way to - we just have to check our
mail -

STOVIK
(holding the money order)
What’s this

ROBERT
It’s a money order It’s the same
as money

Stovik looks in the envelope pulls out the tie

ROBERT (CONTD)
That’s worth-

STOVIK
No Not this time I’m patching the
leak I can charge 10000 a month
for that space

The Dynes freeze This seems much more serious than
yesterday

THERESA
We won’t we don’t - we have a
child -

Stovik quickly raises his hand to cover the sight of Theresa
tears streaming down his face

ROBERT
(cutting off Theresa)
The whole wall is a sponge
(MORE )

ROBERT (CONTD)
The building should be condemned
really We could report it to The
Department of Health and Human
Services

It’s a standoff

ROBERT (CONTD)
1500 by Friday We need a little
time to get it together

STOVIK
Friday Tomorrow

ROBERT
Oh - I didn’t literally mean - it’s
a saying “by Friday” It means the
end of the week

STOVIK
So next Friday

ROBERT
The one after that

Tears pouring out He ties a weird knot in one end of the tie
and loops it over a pole Before he turns away he points from
his eyes to the tie to them

STOVIK
The Friday after next Two weeks

He walks off The Dynes look spooked

CUT TO

EXT POST OFFICE 22

Just as before Old Dolio has done her moves to avoid the
security cameras - we catch her just before she rolls in to
the door of the post office She starts to put her key in the
box but it won’t go in She tries another key in another box
same thing She is unnerved She does the moves to leave but
just before she exits she sees A PICTURE OF HERSELF on the
wall one in a row of “Reward” pictures taped to the wall
She quickly pulls it off the wall and exits

CUT TO

OMIT 23

EXT STREET - A FEW MINUTES LATER 24

They are walking together now in silence Robert is looking
at the “Reward” picture The picture has an official United
States Postal Service seal on it and a description of Old
Dolio The reward is 300 Old Dolio is breathing heavily
spooked

OLD DOLIO
It was a new camera There’s never
been a camera there

ROBERT
300 reward this is a scarecrow
It means scram We’1ll just use
another post office If they don’t
want our business -—

THERESA
She can never go in another post
office again Ever That job is
over

Old Dolio is surprised and touched by this protectiveness
Theresa senses this

THERESA (CONTD)
Why even have hair if you’re not
going to use it

OLD DOLIO
It was a new -

ROBERT
It’s too bad it’s really too bad

OLD DOLIO
I’1l just never go in-

ROBERT
Yeah but this kind of fuck-up

ROBERT

ROBERT (CONTD)

Old Dolio’s face falls she’s so ashamed Theresa told him

ROBERT (CONTD)

Gestures to her pants Old Dolio scrambles to pull her skirt
out of her pants She must redeem herself

CUT TO

INT BUS A FEW MINUTES LATER 25

Robert and Theresa are sitting together Old Dolio is in the
seat behind them thinking hard Someone on the bus has a big
suitcase that is threatening to roll away with each stop Old
Dolio watches this farce then suddenly has an idea

OLD DOLIO
Can I have the phone I think the
The Ooh La Luxe -

THERESA
(interrupting)
Just drop it

OLD DOLIO
I think we can get cash out of it

Long silence

ROBERT
But it involves flying
OLD DOLIO
Yes but -
ROBERT

What’s the number one most
dangerous form of transit

THERESA OLD DOLIO
(whispers) Airplanes But in New York we
Airplanes could -

ROBERT
- spend money That’s what you do
in New York

As they talk a nearby group of Catholic schoolgirls in
uniforms look at Old Dolio in her uniform with smiles and
confusion

CATHOLIC SCHOOLGIRL
I like your costume

OLD DOLIO
It’s a uniform From my school

CATHOLIC SCHOOLGIRL 2
(gesturing to the patch)
Oh do you go to Hogwarts

The girls laugh They are getting off the bus

CATHOLIC SCHOOLGIRL CATHOLIC SCHOOLGIRL 2
That’s a Harry Potter (CONTD)
costume She knows she knows

The Catholic schoolgirls exit Old Dolio immediately looks
down at what’s she’s wearing dismayed

OLD DOLIO
This is not an actual - Im wearing
a Halloween costume

ROBERT THERESA
That makes sense Yeah because we bought it
around

ROBERT
(finishing the previous
conversation)
Anyway a finder’s fee - that’s a
sure thing
(he hands her the watch)

Old Dolio looks at it carefully

OLD DOLIO
So I’ll ask for what 500 -

ROBERT
(interrupting)
Ask for Youre a nice kid you
found this watch Reward Nothing
could be further from your mind
That’ll get you 500 Ask for a
reward and you’ll get fifty max

Old Dolio looks out the window annoyed

ROBERT (CONTD)
Well don’t trust me trust human
psychology

Theresa nods

The only way it wont work is if
the door opens and Victor and
Althea are horses Or dogs A pair
of yorkies

CUT TO

26 EXT VICTOR AND ALTHEA’S HOUSE A FEW MINUTES LATER 26

VICTOR and ALTHEA (African-American 70s well-off) stand in
the doorway of a very nice house talking to Old Dolio
Victor is putting his watch back on We see Robert and
Theresa in the a distance pretending to be a couple
strolling up the street

OLD DOLIO
(pointing to their
driveway )
it was just right there I
almost stepped on it

VICTOR
(putting his watch on with
a chuckle)
This whole time it was just right
there

ALTHEA
Do you go to Sacred Heart

Old Dolio nods vaguely But it’s enough she’s suddenly like
family Althea opens the door and gestures for her to come in
while saying
ALTHEA (CONTD)
Ohh our daughter Jenny went to

Sacred Heart Here let’s get you a
Coke

CUT TO

27 INT VICTOR AND ALTHEA’S LIVING ROOM A FEW MINUTES LATER 27

Old Dolio is drinking a Coke self-consciously

ALTHEA
it’s a Paul Williams all
original features

VICTOR
Except the floors Those are new
Do you know what colleges you’re
applying to

OLD DOLIO ALTHEA
I’m applying to Harvard Jenny went to Sarah Lawrence

and

OLD DOLIO
(jumping on Althea’s line)
--Sarah Lawrence

ALTHEA
Oh Sarah Lawrence is incredible -
you should talk to Jenny about it
(gestures to something in
the house and says “built
ins” or something)

VICTOR
Jenny is a phenomenal masseuse
She’s building up her clientele -

ALTHEA
And she’s a waitress at Melisse -
really more of a manager
(off Victor’s look)
Well she is Practically

INT VICTOR AND ALTHEA’S HOUSE ENTRANCEWAY A FEW MINUTES 28
LATER

Althea and Victor have walked Old Dolio to the door
ALTHEA
I wish there was something we could
do to thank you
She looks at Victor but they can’t think of anything

ALTHEA (CONTD)
I’ve always believed in angels

VICTOR
Not me that’s her thing

They are smiling and waiting for Old Dolio to go Old Dolio
wants to say something but knows she can’t mention a reward

VICTOR (CONTD)
Good luck with everything life
offers you

Old Dolio walks out the front door with disbelief no reward
But she has no choice she walks forward

ALTHEA
Wait

Relief on Old Dolio’s face and a little knowing smile

EXT YOUNG NEIGHBORHOOD A FEW MINUTES LATER 29

As Old Dolio walks through the neighborhood she sees Robert
and Theresa in the distance She’s not used to seeing them
from afar They look alien as they dart onto people’s porches
and quietly take their Amazon packages She catches up with
them and holds out a piece of paper It’s a gift certificate
for a massage The piece of paper is designed to look like
money

ROBERT
(taking the gift
certificate)
What’s this

OLD DOLIO
My reward Their daughter is a
masseuse

She is angrily zipping open her backpack and quickly changing
from the schoolgirl outfit to her usual big freebie tee shirt
and sweats She stuffs the other outfit into in her backpack
They are all crestfallen

ROBERT
‘Don’t ask for a reward’ was plan A
- but plan B was Ask for a reward
Rich people can sometimes be very
cheap

OLD DOLIO
They talked about her nonstop “She
works at Melisse””she went to
college” They’re obsessed with
her it was creepy

ROBERT
That’s the most expensive
restaurant in LA

OLD DOLIO
She just works there
ROBERT
Even to work there you have to be
rich -
THERESA
(interrupting)

We have two weeks Less than that

Robert looks around wildly for a solution to their money
problems his eyes land on Theresa’s stolen Amazon package

THERESA (CONTD)
(shaking the box)
This is probaby an eight dollar
eyeliner

ie not gonna save them Everyone is silent and stressed
Robert looks angry Looking away and handing her the yellow
phone he says

ROBERT
What’s the job The one that
involves flying

Old Dolio can’t believe it Robert looks down at the gift
certificate with frustration

OLD DOLIO
(starts typing on the
phone)
Ok I think if we

ROBERT
Wait “4305 and a half Fair Glen
Road” That’s where you just were
this is right behind their house
It’s worth money See dollar
signs This type of high-end - this
is worth two maybe three hundred
dollars

He takes the yellow phone back he and Theresa are so
relieved they’re almost laughing Old Dolio is disappointed
They are walking her back to the house but stop short to
avoid being seen

ROBERT (CONTD)
(to Old Dolio)
Cash refund She’1ll understand -
she’s a businesswoman

THERESA
You know what he means by
businesswoman right Prostitute

CUT TO

EXT VICTOR AND ALTHEA’S YARD A MINUTE LATER 30

Old Dolio is picking her way to the studio in the backyard

INT STUDIO BEHIND THE MAIN HOUSE A FEW MINUTES LATER 31

Old Dolio is pretty stressed - the negotiations with JENNY
late 40s are not going well Jenny is a sad character as
one can surmise from the details of her life

OLD DOLIO
What about a percentage of the
total value Like 75 of the total
value

Jenny doesn’t know what to make of this woman
JENNY
No I - sorry that’s not - how did
you say you know my parents
Old Dolio is looking around the room wildly
OLD DOLIO
Ok understood How ‘bout an

exchange For that rock

She points to a giant crystal She’s talking kind of like
Robert

JENNY
No no it’s not-
OLD DOLIO
Or these -
(she points to some
speakers)

No Ok fine - that shelf And
that’1ll be my finalbecause it’s
not worth very much

(MORE )

OLD DOLIO (CONTD)
I would be taking a loss on - on
the - the massage

It’s clear Jenny isn’t going to do an exchange because that’s
nuts Old Dolio gives up with an “I give up” gesture and
backs away towards the door she’s still holding the gift
certificate

JENNY
I’1l take that

Old Dolio is reluctant to give it up

JENNY (CONTD)
You don’t want the massage right

Old Dolio is frustrated almost angry She feels like she’s
throwing money away She studies Jenny warily up and down
She walks over to the massage table and touches it gingerly
Then she suddenly starts to climb on to it

JENNY (CONTD)
Oh - Ill step out and you can take
off your clothes Face down

Old Dolio is on the table with all her clothes on She flips
over on to her stomach After a moment Jenny begins to
massage her Old Dolio jolts with the shock of being touched

OLD DOLIO
How long does this take

JENNY
Your gift certificate is for a 60
minute session

OLD DOLIO
Oh I don’t - can you do it more
quickly like twenty minutes

JENNY
Ok

Jenny massages

JENNY (CONTD)
Tell me if it’s too much pressure

OLD DOLIO
(immediately )
Too much pressure

JENNY
Is that better

OLD DOLIO
Too much

Jenny shifts and just barely touches Old Dolio’s shirt

JENNY
Hows this

Old Dolio makes a negative noise Jenny removes her hands
altogether and just hovers them over Old Dolio’s body

JENNY (CONTD)
Is that better

OLD DOLIO
Yeah

Jenny is surprised that Old Dolio’s voice still is very full
of feeling - this is still a lot for her Just being so
vulnerable with this person near her Jenny sees some drops
hitting the floor under Old Dolio’s face

There’s a knock at the door

JENNY
Maybe that’s my parents - do they
know youre

Old Dolio sits up worried quickly wiping her face But it’s
Robert and Theresa they scurry in (Theresa with her limp)
not wanting to be seen by the folks in the big house

THERESA
Hi we’re with herit was taking
a while so

Old Dolio climbs down from the massage table

Theresa and Robert are silent for a moment looking Jenny up
and down and catching up

ROBERT
No refund

JENNY
I don’t do refunds on gifts We’re
almost done -- she only wanted 20
minutes

ROBERT

Can we get that rock for the other
40 minutes

He points to the same crystal

THERESA
Or 20 20 and 20
(pointing to herself and
Robert)
Well split the massage three ways

Jenny is shaking her head no through all of this - absolutely
not

ROBERT
And do we have to use it all now
Could we have 8 five-minute
sessions that we use over the next
year

JENNY
No it’s non-transferable and I
don’t divide sessions I’ma
licensed

As she talks Robert and Theresa realize this is a loss - they
look at Old Dolio who looks slightly triumphant Their faces
darken

CUT TO

INT DYNE BUILDING THAT EVENING 32

Three old suitcases are laid out on the low black vinyl
bench they have yellow ribbons on them Robert and Theresa
are on one side of the bench Old Dolio on the other holding
the yellow phone

OLD DOLIO
We fly to New York together on
Wednesday and fly right back as
strangers At the baggage carousel
I don’t know you guys

Theresa and Robert look down at the bags as if they are
moving by Theresa glances up at Old Dolio

OLD DOLIO (CONT’D)
Don’t look at me

THERESA
I’m just looking around To make
sure these are the bags from my
flight
(to Robert)
Excuse me is this where the
luggage from New York comes out
OLD DOLIO ROBERT

Ok but you know each other We’re a couple

THERESA
Oh I see I’m the dum-dum now I
have a Bachelor’s degree She
doesn’t know what that is

OLD DOLIO

(forging on)
You “accidentally” take my bags and
go home Take the 117 to the blue
line I stay at the airport I wait
and wait for my bags finally I
report my loss Luckily I have
traveler’s insurance They issue a
check for

(she glances at yellow

phone)
1575 We can sign it right over
to Stovik the next day More than a
full week early

ROBERT
He might even give us a discount
for being earlywell no I guess
not -

THERESA
(interrupting)
We have to fly all the way there
just to fly back That seems like a
lot of flying

Robert pretends to “see” the bags and lugs them off the
couch stumbles away rolling all of them

ROBERT
Why would we have this much stuff

THERESA
Maybe one is just for my shoes

ROBERT
Right “You and your shoes”

THERESA
You could make a joke about Imelda
Marcos

Robert realizes this is a solid plan takes the phone back
with a nod Old Dolio melts a little

ROBERT
What

THERESA
That’s the joke people make when
women have a lot of shoes Imelda
Marcos

ROBERT
Now I can’t say that You took the
spontaneity out of it

They bicker

CUT TO

INT AIRPORT TUNNEL A FEW DAYS LATER (WEDNESDAY ) 33

Lots of people walk down a tunnel towards a plane eventually
we see Robert Theresa and Old Dolio in the line-up their
faces grimly set except for Old Dolio who looks secretly
exalted They are dressed in their usual big tee shirts

CUT TO

INT AIRPLANE 40 MINUTES LATER 34

The plane is in flight Smooth flying so far The three of
them sit in a row Robert and Theresa anxiously notice every
little noise and ding Old Dolio carefully opens a little bag
with free cheap earbuds and studies the plug Suddenly there
is some turbulence Robert and Theresa look around wildly
The turbulence worsens the stewardess asks everyone to
buckle their seat belts Robert and Theresa are truly
stricken as if they are about to die Robert holds on to
Theresa Old Dolio is uncertain - everyone around them looks
pretty calm but she’s getting nervous - first time flier

The turbulence persists loudly Theresa is mumbling
something under her breath looks like she’s going to faint
Robert is looking around wildly for some kind of distraction

ROBERT
(to Theresa)
Just breathe normally Let’s talk
Talk talk - say something

Theresa raises the volume on her mumbling it’s some kind of
prayer

ROBERT (CONTD)
Don’t pray Are you praying Just
talk Hi how are you

Theresa can’t Robert turns to Old Dolio on his other side
ROBERT (CONTD)
Hi how are youAAAAH
(big bump)

Old Dolio is watching them lose their shit with some surprise
and confusion

OLD DOLIO
Fine
ROBERT
What are your interests
OLD DOLIO
My
ROBERT
Interests interests go
OLD DOLIO
I-I don’t-
Lots of turbulence
ROBERT

Anything Talk

Old Dolio is awkward at talking but she attempts to talk
about an idea that seems to have stuck in her head

OLD DOLIO
Some people think that a brand new
baby if you put it on the abdomen
it’ll just automatically crawl up
to the mom’s breast but if you put
it on a cot they’ll I guess cry
more Breast Crawl -

ROBERT
Don’t say breast

OLD DOLIO
But I wonder how would a baby know
where -—

ROBERT
(interrupting)
Ok - it’s smoothed out - you can

Old Dolio falls silent

THERESA
What’s your point with all that
OLD DOLIO
He told me to talk
THERESA
You pregnant
OLD DOLIO
Was I put on a cot or did I crawl
up -
THERESA
(interrupting)
Answer
OLD DOLIO

No I’m not - when could that have
even happened -

THERESA
A cot
(to Robert)
Is she pregnant

Robert sniffs around Old Dolio’s body

ROBERT
No

The turbulence suddenly becomes much worse Thunderous The
captain asks the flight attendants to take their jumpseats

ROBERT (CONTD)
(to Theresa)
You heard that

THERESA
Are jumpseats -

ROBERT
So they can jump out when it goes
down

THERESA
Withparachutes

ROBERT
(to Old Dolio)
We’re going down
Old Dolio now looks scared She breathes heavily

Robert realizes what she means and regards her with

horror

OLD DOLIO
Once we dieeverything’1l go dark
- right away Or -

ROBERT
Immediately And forever and it’s
complete a never-ending void

OLD DOLIO
(fatalistic)
I guess it doesn’t matter too much
as long as we’re together Just
have to get through the crash

ROBERT
What No

OLD DOLIO
I don’t think it will hurt-

ROBERT
No that’s not - the plan is I die
first because I’m the oldest and
you guys take care of me -

THERESA

Then me

- then Theresa then later you
That’s the order of who buries who

Old Dolio thinks about this

OLD DOLIO
Who buries me

ROBERT
(distractedly)
Well that’sI don’t know - that’s
your own problem

He looks away Old Dolio feels a different kind of scared

now

ROBERT (CONT’D)
If we make it we’re never doing
this again

OLD DOLIO
(quickly)
We have to do the return flight or
it’s a total loss

Robert looks sick at the thought The turbulence increases

CUT TO

INT AIRPLANE - A FEW HOURS LATER 35

The plane has landed and everyone is shuffling off As
Robert Theresa and Old Dolio pass through the first class
cabin they quietly grab everything they can blankets packs
of uneaten food bottles of water

CUT TO

EXT NEWARK AIRPORT ADJACENT TWILIGHT 36

The same longing hold music (that Old Dolio listened to
earlier) plays over

The Dynes are waiting in a grassy area near the airport it’s
not much more than a curb They’re sitting apart from each
other all using the first class supplies The music pauses

HOLD RECORDING
Thank you for waiting someone will
be with you shortly

Music resumes Old Dolio has her new airplane earbuds in she
listens to her cell phone and looks into the distance at New
York City There it is the majestic skyline so close so
far She’s almost shaking with yearning - she’s never been so
far from home They wait

CUT TO

INT AIRPLANE 2 LATE THAT NIGHT - RED EYE FLIGHT 37

Robert and Theresa shuffle down the aisle they’re in the
same outfits - the big tee shirts They sit down in a row of
three seats And here comes Old Dolio in a businesswoman
costume She sits in an aisle seat next to a businessman She
sees that Robert and Theresa are sitting next to a young
woman with big headphones on who is already super chatty in a
way that Old Dolio knows her parents will hate

INT AIRPLANE 2 - THIRTY MINUTES LATER 38

The turbulence has begun again Old Dolio looks sideways at
Robert and Theresa They are gripping their armrests and
panicking Old Dolio is scared too Everyone else on the
plane looks fine

INT AIRPLANE 2 - FIFTEEN MINUTES LATER 39

Old Dolio listens without turning her head the young woman
seated next to her parents is talking She’s MELANIE (Latina
25) She’s very beautiful and sexy in a conventional way
wearing a low-cut tight shirt and skinny jeans Long pink
press-on nails

MELANIE
I was visiting my mom she lives
on Long Island which is like bleh
were from Pasadena but she
movedis this the kind of
thing

Turbulence increases

ROBERT
Keep going Anything anything

MELANTE
Um um what should II’ma

Suddenly a big jolt
THERESA

You still think this is a normal
amount of turbulence for this

route

MELANIE
Yes

THERESA
Really

MELANIE

Totally OH NO
THERESA
(very worried)
WHAT

MELANTE
Oh ha I thought I forgot my
headphones but they’re right here

She pats them around her neck

MELANIE (CONTD)
(looking at her phone)
Did they say there’s wifi Oh there

ROBERT
Youre better off

MELANIE
Oh I know I’m the worst I like

ROBERT

(gritting through

turbulence - points to

her phone)
That’s a tool It was originally
designed by and for the military
and intelligence community The CIA
and Army ground-ops specifically
It’s a powerful dangerous tool

MELANTE
You don’t have a cell phone

ROBERT
I use it as it was intended I
don’t dress it up and play dolly
with it

Melanie nods taking this in and looking at their clothes

She put her phone (in its blingy case) in her purse

MELANTE
You should never meet my mom She’s
always on her phone and
sheshe

(thinks for best example)
-you know how Costco has like
Gold Star membership Elite
membership She’s the one above
Elite

The flight attendant comes with their drinks

MELANIE (CONTD)
Yes thank you The screwdriver is
for her gin and tonic
(pointing at Robert)
gin and tonic
(pointing at herself)

Robert and Theresa look at their drinks suspiciously Old
Dolio can’t help but look - what is going on over there
Melanie is exactly the sort of superficial woman who they
despise (An ordinary girl)

MELANIE (CONTD)
Trust me this’ll help a lot

THERESA
My concern is that we might not be
thinking clearly enough in the
event of an emergency

MELANTE
Oh Are you My aunt has a
friend who’s Amish

ROBERT
We’re not Amish We use alcohol
when we’re injured to numb pain

MELANIE
Ok That sounds Amish I know
there’s a lot of discrimination My
friend went to a Quakerschool-

The foam alarms on Robert and Theresa’s watches suddenly
start beeping And Old Dolio’s watch It’s an odd moment of
connection between them - and Melanie starts to turn her head
to see where the other alarm is coming from To distract
Robert drinks his drink Theresa follows suit

MELANIE (CONTD)
There you go chug chug chug
let’s get this party started

CUT TO

INT DYNE BUILDING SAME MOMENT 40

We see the bubbles falling into a jerry-rigged tarp that has
been attached to the wall and is supposed to channel the foam
into the drain It doesn’t really work We watch the whole
thing slowly fall apart

CUT BACK TO

INT AIRPLANE 2 LATER IN THE FLIGHT 41

Cabin lights are dimmed with overhead lights on above the
Dynes A BUSINESSMAN is standing in the aisle talking to
Melanie and looking down her shirt at her breasts

BUSINESSMAN
You never lived in Provincetown

who looks -

Robert whispers something to Theresa

MELANIE
I never did

THERESA
(whispering to Melanie)
He’s looking down your blouse

BUSINESSMAN MELANIE
Well you sure (whispering back to
lookfamiliar but ok Is Theresa)
this business or I know I can handle it

The Businessman doesn’t quite catch what they’re saying but
is put off he thought she was traveling alone He holds up
his hands like Hey I’m a good guy and backs away down the
aisle to his seat

Robert pats his pockets

ROBERT
Check your pockets everyone That
might have been a bait and switch

MELANIE
A what

ROBERT
A distraction fromhe might be a
pickpocket

MELANIE
You meana thief That’s not what
just -

ROBERT
You don’t know about this kind of
thing

MELANTE
Don’t know It happens to me every
day

Robert and Theresa look at her taking in what she means -
and Melanie looks at them suddenly suspiciouscurious

MELANIE (CONTD)
Sowhat do you guys do

They look opaque

MELANIE (CONTD)

You know everything about me you
know my address my grandmothers

ROBERT
Yep
MELANTE
Wow that was a pretty good guess
(pause)

No you’re not

Old Dolio watches Melanie wag her finger at Robert and
Theresa slowly like she knows something Theresa glances at
Robert he’s a bit mesmerized by that finger Robert takes a
sip of his drink Long pause

ROBERT
Would you say you’re a trustworthy
person Is that one of your
qualities
THERESA
(uneasy )
You don’t have to answer tha-

Melanie’s eyes light up and dart between the two of them
with anticipation

MELANIE
Yes

A pinched smile from Theresa

Old Dolio watches as the three of them lean in together What
are they telling her Old Dolio is concerned

CUT TO

INT BAGGAGE CLAIM A COUPLE HOURS LATER 42

Old Dolio waits for her bag with the rest of the people on
her flight - except for Robert Theresa and Melanie They’re
nowhere in sight She’s getting increasingly stressed
watching their bags with the purple ribbon go around and
around

Now Old Dolio looks up and sees Robert with his arm around
Melanie Theresa is touching Melanie’s hair They are
pretending to be a family and as she instructed ignoring
her Old Dolio feels like she’s in a nightmare the pain is
surreal Robert pulls the bags off the belt Old Dolio tries
not to watch but it’s hard Melanie gives her a wink and Old
Dolio quickly looks away The three of them leave each with
a bag or two including Melanie’s luggage

CUT TO

INT UNITED BAGGAGE OFFICE A FEW MINUTES LATER 43

Old Dolio looks up

OLD DOLIO
How long does that take

CLERK
Oh they’re pretty quick Six weeks
at the longest

Old Dolio’s face falls

OLD DOLIO
And at the shortest

CUT TO

INT BUS A FEW MINUTES LATER 44

Old Dolio is on the bus ashen and disappointed As the bus

pulls away from the airport she gets a text There’s been a

change of plans She quickly dings the bell a bunch of times
for the next stop

CUT TO

INT “THE DRUNKEN PILOT” A BAR NEAR THE AIRPORT A FEW 45
MINUTES LATER

Old Dolio sees them before they see her Robert and Theresa
are listening to Melanie tell some long funny story
Laughter Melanie sees Old Dolio

MELANTE
(low voice)
She’s here Don’t worry I got
this

Melanie picks up a menu and pretends to work at the bar
MELANIE (CONTD)
Ma’m I can seat you right this

way

Terrible (and unnecessary) acting Old Dolio is repulsed by
her Melanie tries to walk her over to their table

MELANIE (CONTD)
(whispers )
Just roll with it How much did you
get for the bags
Old Dolio is not happy that she knows this much

MELANIE (CONTD)

These guys at my college used to do
that same scam with the luggage
every Christmas vacation I think
you can get more if you -

OLD DOLIO
It’s an original con I invented
it

MELANIE
Oh Ok

Old Dolio pulls away and talks discreetly to Robert and
Theresa blocking Melanie with her body She discreetly
gestures to Melanie and gives Robert and Theresa a pleading
look like what have you done Robert looks vague and guilty
Melanie is in the background kind of unconsciously dancing
to the music playing in the bar

THERESA
(defensively)
We had all those bags You weren’t
there to help us with the bags

ROBERT
And hey this was your plan This
whole - so we can’t take blame -

THERESA
(overlaps)
That’s true That’s a really good
point

Old Dolio face hardens

OLD DOLIO
I don’t think the check will be
here by Friday

ROBERT
What

OLD DOLIO
It might Or it might take six
weeks
(pause)
And the PO boxes are locked so I
has to give them our

Robert and Theresa’s faces fall A new song comes on and
Melanie lights up in the background this is her jam
ROBERT
(in disbelief)
No you didn’t

Robert shakes his head slowly He might still be slightly

intoxicated

ROBERT (CONTD)
Youre not unintelligent - you’re
not You might even have an above
average IQbut only when you
don’t think — the second you start
thinking you become almost like a
retarded person And you’re
thinking more and more these days

OLD DOLIO
No I’m not

THERESA
She’s really not

ROBERT
You led them right to us right to
our door In six weekswho knows

OLD DOLIO
It might come sooner It varies

Melanie dances over listening in

MELANIE
What might come sooner The check

This is more than Old Dolio can bear
OLD DOLIO
(as if Melanie can’t hear)
Who is she even How is this person
an an asset I don’t understand

Melanie’s smile fades she looks flustered

MELANTE
Maybe I should use the rest room

She hurries towards the rest room
BARTENDER
It’s broken you have to use the

one outside by the gas station

CUT

TO

EXT GAS STATION BATHROOM A MINUTE LATER NIGHT 46

Melanie enters the bathroom tries to turn on the light but
it’s broken She hesitates with her foot in the door then
turns on her phone for light Immediately there’s a FaceTime
call from her mom She declines it locks the door and starts
to pee - the Facetime rings again Her face is lit by the
glow from the phone

The TV is blaring in Mom’s room

MELANIE
Yes

MOM
Uh There you are hon I’ve been
calling nonstop

Melanie hastily finishes stands up starts to get out of
there unlocking the door

MELANTE
Sorry I had it on Airplane mode -

MOM
Ok so you landed You’re home

If she leaves Mom will see she’s not at home - so she
finishes the call in the bathroom

MOM (CONTD)

MELANTE

MOM

lined up but that’s impossible now

MELANIE
Yeah And I -

MOM
Ok so it’ll come Tuesno yeah

As her mom goes on the camera pushes in slowly on Melanie WE
haven’t seen her like this before but it’s clearly nothing
new - she knows how to shut herself down Her spark isn’t
there

MOM (CONTD)
Mm I saw something this morning

Vebo Infusion Pitcher V-e-b-
oclick on the bottom picture and
then zoom in zoom in zoom in
(suddenly)
Oh god This guy’s old rocking
chair is worth -
(laugh)
- it’s worth half a million
dollars
(laugh)

We hear the TV in the background someone is freaking out
“Half a million I had no idea”

Melanie blinks She just got an idea sort of
MOM (CONTD)
He’s so surprisedhe had no
ideawas keeping papers bills
stacks of bills

CUT TO

INT “THE DRUNKEN PILOT” A BAR NEAR THE AIRPORT A MINUTE 47
LATER

Melanie bursts back into the bar and sits down with the
Dynes

MELANIE
I have a heist we can do To get
the 1500

Old Dolio scoffs Robert and Theresa are charmed

MELANIE (CONTD)

(talking very fast)
Ok should I just say it Ok So
I’m not a physician’s assistant -
that wasanyway I work at
Abram’s Optics in the Galleria -
which if you don’t know it’s like
the worst branch there is I just
sell bifocals to agro old people
all day Mean but also like super
lonely and desperate - like I’ve
been invited to Easter to mah
jong to look at scrapbooks and I
don’t go because they’re gross but
if I did I bet there would be mad
antiques Yep Not like super fancy
because these people are on
Medicaid but if I said I liked
something they would probably give
it to me for free or cheap and then
we sell it and make a “tidy
profit Boom

Melanie is very proud of herself Old Dolio is still
listening as if there will be more that will make this a job
- a legitimate con She looks searchingly at Robert - the
wheels are turning in his head

OLD DOLIO
Who do we sell the antiques to

MELANTE
Maybe a stall at the flea market I
love the flea market It’s so
indie I used to have a patch
collection Ok I had like three
patches-

ROBERT
It’s a great plan Tremendous

Melanie is pleased Old Dolio is horrified Even Theresa is a
little surprised - then she sees how Robert is looking at
Melanie’s body - ah

THERESA
We do a three way split -

Gestures between herself and Old Dolio and Robert

MELANIE
Of course yeah it’s like an
internship
(to Old Dolio)
I’m Melanie

ROBERT
Right Ok Melanie - this is Old
Dolio
MELANIE
Old
OLD DOLIO
Dolio
MELANIE

“Old Dolio” Ok I like that
(she looks at all three of
them nodding)

See this is exactly -

There is a tremor an earthquake Melanie and the other
people in the restaurant are not worried it happens so
often But Robert Theresa and Old Dolio are all terrified
and their hands are raised off the table as if it might shock
them Melanie’s phone rings and she reaches for it

ROBERT
Don’t touch it
(the phone)
and don’t touch the table

Melanie slowly moves her hands away

ROBERT (CONT’D)
Ive been through tremors smaller
than this one - turned everything
electric Zap

Melanie participates in the polite smile everyone in the room
is sharing as the tremor continues Robert is annoyed by
this

ROBERT (CONT’D)
The Big One will start just like
this but the noise will build and
build - this one isn’t building -
have you ever heard a thermometric
bomb Loud

Old Dolio is nodding That’s right The tremor stops

ROBERT (CONTD)
The ground will whip around like
something’s tail and if you’re
lucky you’ll be crushed and die
right then -

MELANIE
(jumping in)
So YOLO Am I right

48 EXT “THE DRUNKEN PILOT” PARKING LOT A FEW MINUTES LATER 48

They are all walking out Old Dolio in the rear Melanie
hangs back to talk to her in a confiding tone

MELANIE
They are like real characters
Super unique But you vouch for
them right

OLD DOLIO
Vouch

MELANIE
I just mean on the level of like
basic safety I have a friend who
did stripping I could never do
that But this seems moreOk if
I’m being honest My favorite
movies are the Ocean’s 11 movies
so I’m pretty psyched to be in on
an actualheist

Old Dolio gives her nothing

MELANIE (CONTD)
How did you meet them

OLD DOLIO
They’re my parents

CUT TO

EXT “THE DRUNKEN PILOT” PARKING LOT CONTINUOUS 49

They all get in Melanie’s car an old Toyota The Dynes
aren’t used to being in cars

EXT PARKING LOT (MELANIE’S CAR) 50

Melanie buckles her seat belt and is about to start the car
but stops

MELANIE
Safety first

No one moves

MELANIE (CONTD)
Buckle up

THERESA
Auto-industry ploy

ROBERT
It’s safer to crumple on impact
and the big boys at GM know that
These little doohickies
(flicks seatbelt)
only protect them from lawsuit

MELANTE
Crumple

Theresa crumples in a kind of disturbing way she looks like
a dead body with her mouth hung open

THERESA
(slurring)
You have to release all your
muscles I can show you how You’1l
soil yourself at first that’s
normal

Theresa straightens up Melanie starts the car loud music
blasts

CUT TO

INT ABRAM’S OPTICS THE NEXT DAY (FRIDAY) 51

Melanie wearing her employee vest is helping a customer
SUE pick out frames

MELANTE
You tried those last time and you
didn’t like them remember

SUE
Oh that’s right

MELANIE
What about these The pink is nice
withyour nails

Sue holds her nails up to the glasses

SUE
I use the Sally Hansen “Tough-As-
Nails” undercoat

She taps her nails together a few times and looks at
Melanie’s long press-on nails

SUE (CONTD)
I could do yours I’m not squeamish
about you know - I used to do my
daughter’s nails and all her
friends beautiful girls all
different nationalitiesthe
African girls used to beg me

A familiar anger grows in Melanie - but then she remembers
her plan and carefully glances around to see if her co-
workers are looking

SUE (CONTD)
Never trained totally self-taught
It’s just a thing I was born with -

CUT TO

INT PARKING GARAGE OF SUE’S BLDG THE NEXT DAY 52

Theresa is limping up the stairs of an underground parking
garage Robert is behind her They are wearing costumes (a
flowery dress a fatherly blazer) As Theresa and Robert
arrive on the ground level Melanie is waiting

THERESA
That’s an interesting shirt

MELANIE
Thank you This actually used to be
a skirt but I just pulled it up
It’s workin right

She gyrates her butt a little and then stops mid-move Old
Dolio has appeared at the top of the stairs in her oversized
track suit Melanie can’t believe she didn’t notice her
boyish HOTNESS before She recovers and continues talking
leading them to Sue’s

MELANIE (CONTD)
(whisper)
She’1ll want to feed us and give us
manicures So if there’s something
you want just point at it And
I’1l be like “Oh I love your”

Now they are in front of Sue’s door Old Dolio quickly unzips
her sweatshirt to reveal a button down shirt and V neck - a
costume

The door opens there’s Sue
MELANIE (CONTD)

Hi Sue You look so great Here we
are This ismy family

SUE
Oh I wasn’t sure how many
people
They follow her in
INT SUE’S DINING ROOM CONTINUOUS 53

Places are set at the table but Sue quickly adds a few more
pulling out chairs There is BRITISH PARAPHERNALIA
everywhere pictures of the royal family There’s a little
dog we mostly just hear his tags jangling

SUE
I made a fruit salad that I think
you might flip over Kids love it
(whispers )
Marshmallows

MELANIE
Yum

Sue sits down and opens her little manicure kit
SUE
So I can do French tip a buff set

you name it

Melanie glances down at her own nails she’d actually rather
not fuck them up

Theresa seems shyly eager to get her nails done and starts to
come forward but Melanie doesn’t notice and nudges Old Dolio
forward

MELANIE
Go ahead

They all watch Old Dolio unhappily sit across from Sue and
put her hands out very reluctantly Robert is ranging around
the apartment looking it over Melanie touches a pair of
ceramic dogs

MELANIE (CONTD)
Oh I love these

She looks around for Robert to give him a conspiratorial look
but he’s not around

SUE
Aren’t they great My husband gave
them to me

Melanie immediately peers around for something else She
notices a vase

MELANIE
This Is great

She looks for Robert and sees him in the kitchen behind Sue
slowly ripping a check out of a checkbook Melanie’s face
drops shocked Old Dolio watches all this and smiles
inwardly Theresa clocks it too becomes alert It all makes
sense now - they’re just using Melanie to get checks But
Melanie needs to pull it together her jaw has dropped
Seeing her alarm Sue turns to look at what she’s looking at
Theresa knocks her fruit salad all over the table to redirect
attention

THERESA
(in a British accent)
Blimey I’ve made a wretched mess
I’m afraid

Sue hurries to clean it up Theresa is picking up chunks of
fruit

OLD DOLIO
(also in a British accent)
Let me do it Mum I’ve got it -

THERESA
(British)
- youll spoil your nails love

OLD DOLIO
(British)
It’s no bother at all

Both Sue and Melanie are looking at them slightly
bewildered

SUE
I didn’t noticeat firstthat
you’rebut you’re not British
(pointing to Melanie)

MELANTE
No
SUE
No you’re too dark
MELANTE
(quietly)

There’s dark people everywhere

SUE
Oh I know I just mean - What you
think of when youimagine

Theresa sees Melanie is angry Behind them Robert is now
photographing a check receipt with a click

THERESA
(British)
She’s adopted We always say we
were given one and we chose one

Old Dolio blinks at this

SUE
(bending down to pick up
her little dog)
That’s how I feel about Doodlebug

Robert gives them a nod and heads for the door Theresa slips
the MANICURE KIT into her purse They all get up to leave
much to Sue’s confusion

THERESA
(British)
Doodlebug is a beautiful name is
that -

SUE
It’s French

CUT TO

EXT FAST FOOD RESTAURANT (CAR) - A FEW MINUTES LATER 54

Melanie drives looking upset Not talking for a while -
finally

MELANIE
I need some fries and a milkshake
At least those two things

Theresa lets out a nervous laugh

OLD DOLIO
(chuckle)
We don’t eat - at places like -

ROBERT

(explaining)
Wait-staff is fine for the
handicapped but if you’re able-
bodied why would you pay to have
someone go like this

(motions putting a plate

down )
Unless like I said youre
handicapped or -

She pulls into a fast food place

MELANIE
(interrupting)
There’s no waiters it’s fast food

CUT TO

INT FAST FOOD RESTAURANT A FEW MINUTES LATER 55

They are all at a table Melanie is eating fries and a shake
The Dynes look awkward in the booth Theresa has a mountain
of catsup mustard salt and pepper packets that she puts in
her bag Robert is filling out Sue’s check for 650 he
slides the check and pen to Old Dolio

OLD DOLIO
650 We need 1500

ROBERT
We don’t want to push it
(to Melanie)
Deposits over 700 trigger bank
review So we’ll have to do a few
more

THERESA
Two more by Friday

MELANIE
What I’m not doing that again No

Robert sets the yellow phone down next to the check a photo
of Susan Welles’ signature on a check receipt Theresa
slides a black pen over and Old Dolio forges the signature
then flips it over to endorse it on the other side Theresa
slides a blue pen over for this Melanie is watching this
with discomfort her chewing slows

ROBERT
Amazing right Old Dolio learned
to forge before she learned to
write In fact that’s how she
learned writing

Old Dolio is filled with pride

MELANTE
What about my plan Was that just -

ROBERT
Your plan of cashing in on the
generosity of lonely people

Melanie is ashamed

ROBERT (CONTD)
She wanted to give manicures
right

MELANIE
Right

ROBERT
And she got to Every time we’1l
provide a service like that

MELANIE
No this is - if we get caught for
this shit it’1ll be worse for me
because I’m Puerto Rican

ROBERT
What did you call it A heist This
is a heist We call it a job

MELANIE
Ijust wanted to see what
youyou said I could intern -

ROBERT
I didn’t say that

THERESA
That’s not even a word he would
use What’s that even mean

MELANTE
(flustered)
An intern - like a person who
follows you know like ashadow

THERESA
A shadow I know what that is This
is a shadow

Theresa makes a shadow with her hand in front of the window

ROBERT
This is a shadow

He makes a shadow with his hands

OLD DOLIO
This is a shadow

Old Dolio makes a shadow

Melanie looks about to cry They suddenly seem ghoulish
shape-shifty Melanie gets her purse and starts to get up
from the table They’ve gone too far Old Dolio sees the
panic on Robert’s face and without thinking she grabs
Melanie’s hand Melanie sits down hard and lets out a yelp

MELANIE
You just knocked off my nail

Old Dolio is confused - she doesn’t know about fake nails
the plastic nail is hanging at an odd angle

MELANIE (CONTD)
Now I have to take them all off or
I’ll look like a crazy person
These cost 50

Like a curious child Old Dolio tests the next nail to see if
it will pop off too It does (They are press-on nails with a
“nail guard” underneath )

ROBERT
Fifty dollars Fiddy biddy bom
biddy bom

When he says this a young a cappella choir begins singing
bom biddy bom biddy biddy biddy bom

(https wwwyoutubecomwatchvYWdgTgwwMTM) As this
soundtrack plays Old Dolio gently pops off each nail one by
one Something shifts - in some clumsy way Old Dolio is
managing to keep Melanie here for the moment Despite
herself Melanie is mesmerized by how strangely gentle Old
Dolio’s nail removal is Robert and Theresa are holding their
breath hoping Melanie stays put When the nails are all off
and neatly stacked Old Dolio carefully picks at the glue on
Melanie’s short nails

MELANTE
(curtly)
You need special remover -

Theresa swiftly out a nail polish remover wipe it’s from the
stolen kit Everyone is surprised Old Dolio gingerly dabs
the remover on each nail and the music continues bom biddy
bom Again this is done with such care as if each nail were
its own being Melanie studies her beautiful face Old Dolio
glances up and gives her a little nod stay (They need
her) Melanie swoons a little inside She slowly slides
Sue’s check over and looks at it as Old Dolio continues

CUT TO

EXT BANK A LITTLE LATER 56

Melanie and Old Dolio are sitting in a pretty grassy
areaare they on a date Melanie clearly feels like they
have something cooking between them Old Dolio looks straight
ahead the whole conversation

MELANTE
Have you ever killed anyone

OLD DOLIO
What are you talking about

MELANTE
Ok Phew - were the same on that
I was like Hold up - is she like a
crazy person But no we’re the
same What do you like to do at

ROBERT
(not looking up from his
paper)
It’s been too long What’s she
doing

Melanie and Old Dolio are not alone we now see Robert is
pretending to fill a parking meter on the sidewalk in front
of them

And as Old Dolio surreptitiously glances behind herself we
see Theresa is there too next to an ATM The girls are
sitting on the lawn in front of a bank An innocent-looking
YOUNG MAN strolls up to the ATM and we see Theresa talking to
him

MELANTE
Are you a movie geek I love
movies

OLD DOLIO
(to Robert)
She’s got someone

In the distance we see (but can’t hear) Theresa and the Young
Man talking and gesturing along the lines of I can’t believe
I forgot my ATM card is it possible you could Wow
well I guess if it’s signed

MELANTE
Do you like really spicy food
Because I know this place we could
go they rate the spiciness by-

OLD DOLIO

(low voice without

turning head)
We are being recorded there is a
camera pointed at our backs Every
time you turn your head you’re
linking yourself to me and I am
linked to the woman who is robbing
a bank over there

Melanie is silent After a moment she turns looks back at the
surveillance camera Then she squares herself Theresa walks

past One by one they casually get up walking behind her as

strangers

EXT STREET A FEW MINUTES LATER 57

Now they are walking together Theresa has taken the envelope
of money out of her purse Robert counts it

ROBERT
Yep yep yep This is a very
liquid - high-yield -

Theresa is studying the brand new bills

THERESA
It’s a nice design I never noticed
- it’s sort of chic I like that

Old Dolio has seen them like this before all hopped up It’s
unprofessional usually leads to a slip-up

OLD DOLIO
We should give it to Stovik right
now and say the rest is coming

ROBERT
How dee do how dee do I feel like
a senator Look at that guy

He pauses to look at his reflection in a store window -
holding the envelope of money

MELANIE
Oh I love jacuzzis

Robert’s focus shifts to what’s on the other side of the
window jacuzzis It’s a jacuzzi store

ROBERT
Do you
MELANIE
Oh yeah So relaxing
CUT TO
58 INT JACUZZI STORE A MINUTE LATER 58

They are milling around the store Robert and Theresa are

looking intently at different jacuzzis and at Melanie to
see what she likes Old Dolio is trying to figure out what
the angle is why they are in here Melanie thinks this is
fun

MELANTE
What color is your bathroom Would
burgundy match it Oo this kind is
nice you just slide in

Melanie slides into an empty tub Theresa sees Robert is
headed for the tub so she gets in too

MELANIE (CONTD)
It’s gigantic Get in Old Dolio

OLD DOLIO
(stiffly)
I don’t think you’re supposed to-

JACUZZI SALESMAN

The JACUZZI SALESMAN in a tie and slacks guides her up the
steps and into the tub he gets in too

JACUZZI SALESMAN (CONT’D)
I want you to imagine hot hot water
up to here

Holds his hand just above his nipples As he talks Theresa
and Robert are both very aware of their bodies touching
either side of Melanie - Theresa seems to be enjoying the
feeling Robert is watching her they exchange a shy smile
about this Melanie is hyper aware of Old Dolio keeps
checking on her

JACUZZI SALESMAN (CONT’D)
47 adjustable massaging heads with
targeted neck and shoulder jets
cascading waterfall creating a
soothing ambiance - ambience
Is it ambience Hell you guys
don’t care I had you at massaging

(pause)

No Should I go on She’s sold
(pointing to Melanie)

Old Dolio looks askance at Melanie’s effect on everyone

THERESA
How much is it

JACUZZI SALESMAN

month with 09 APR financing

ROBERT
We pay 150 and walk away with it

JACUZZI SALESMAN

(pause)
Well not this exact one - it has to
be shipped from the warehouse End
of the day tomorrow

As the Jacuzzi Salesman talks Robert gives Theresa an
excited look and she nods

INT JACUZZI STORE - A FEW MINUTES LATER 59

Robert and Theresa are at the counter with the Jacuzzi
Salesman Theresa is holding the envelope of cash and Old
Dolio watches in dismay as she takes out 150 and hands it to
Robert

ROBERT
So if I’m not happy I can return it
at any point and get a full refund

JACUZZI SALESMAN
Well once you install it -

ROBERT
Of course but if it hasn’t been
installed -

JACUZZI SALESMAN
Thensure yeah - like if it
doesn’t fit or the color’s off

Robert gives Old Dolio a subtle wink - it’s a job

ROBERT
(quietly)
A jacuzzi lending library

Old Dolio looks away and sees Melanie - who is nearby in
another jacuzzi All this is her fault somehow Old Dolio
walks to her

JACUZZI SALESMAN
(offscreen to Robert)
Now the cladding is extra but it
sounds like you’re doing an in
ground installation so you won’t
need that

OLD DOLIO
I have a suggestion for you

MELANIE
(eager)
What

OLD DOLIO
Wear more clothes You’re making
everyone uncomfortable

CUT TO

EXT ABE’S HOUSE A FEW DAYS LATER (WEDNESDAY ) 60

Melanie is more covered up than usual no cleavage showing
She’s had her nails redone and is carrying a bag from Abram’s
Optics She’s nervous but ready to do her first real job The
Dynes are in their well-to-do family costumes they all
approach the front porch together

ROBERT
(to Theresa and OD
looking at his watch)
We need to be in and out to catch
the leak at five

Robert knocks

MELANIE
So his name is Abe Oo - this
feels like Mission Impossible Ok
ok he’s what we call a “no show” -
he didn’t pick up his glasses so I
had to give him a reminder call He
asked if I could deliver them
which normally Id be like “no we
don’t do that”

Robert knocks again

MELANIE (CONTD)
When I told him I was bringing my
family he was like crying So
desperate

A voice comes faintly from inside

ABE
Come in

They go in

INT ABE’S LIVING ROOM CONTINUOUS 61

The living room is normal even nice but Abe is nowhere to
be seen An ancient voice calls out from a closed bedroom
door down the hall

MELANTE

ABE
(OS)
I’m not feeling well but please
make yourself at home Please

They look at each other uncertainly Robert wonders if this
is a trap looks suspicious After a moment Theresa
hesitantly helps herself to a glass of water

ABE (CONTD)
(OS)
That’s it Just be how you are at
home Just a normal day around the
house

They all look at Melanie in confusion She shrugs nervously

MELANTE
(whispers )
I think he’s justlonely

THERESA
(nodding whispers)
He’s pretending that were

MELANIE
(whisper)
-right like we’re his family

Robert turns on the TV a golf game

ABE
(OS)
Good that’s nice My son used to
watch that

They all share a satisfied look Robert decides this is good
fortune - they don’t even have to be discreet He starts
unabashedly hunting for Abe’s checkbook Old Dolio follows
suit Theresa starts making cleaning up noises in the
kitchen un-stacking the many CANS OF FOOD in the cupboard
and then stacking them up again Melanie walks into the
kitchen uncertain what to do

THERESA
(projecting her voice)
Hi hon how was school

Old Dolio is surprised to hear a word like this - “hon But
it’s an act Melanie smiles with embarrassment this is so
strange - but kind of fun

MELANTE
School was fine How was your day

ABE A little louder please

MELANTE
(louder )
How was your day What did you do
today Mom

THERESA
That’s nice to be asked that Do
you really want to know

Confusing since they’re acting - Melanie nods brightly

THERESA (CONTD)
Well I’1l tell you - it hasnt
been easy None of my days have
been easy -

Old Dolio is on guard listening to her mom - not sure where
this is headed Robert cheers in response to the game on TV

He’s not actually watching the game still looking for the
checkbook

MELANTE
(to Theresa)
Oh why What happened

THERESA
What happened WellI was young
and rebellious so I made a series
of impulsive decisions and then

She looks at her husband madly opening drawers - and at this
nice house which makes her feel domestic even though she’s
far from that Old Dolio watches her they’re meet eyes -
what will Theresa say

THERESA (CONTD)
the refrigerator broke

Melanie is having fun with this now

MELANTE
Oh
(to Old Dolio)
so you must be the refrigerator
repair person

Old Dolio is caught off guard but looking around realizes
everyone else has a part so

OLD DOLIO
Ok

THERESA
It can’t be fixed

Theresa moves into the pantry and begins clunking around in
there Melanie leans against the fridge flirtatiously

MELANTE
I bet you meet a lot of lonely
women when you’re “out in the
field”

No response

MELANIE (CONTD)
Housewives throwing themselves at
you

Old Dolio ignores her looks through some drawers

MELANIE (CONTD)
We have tools if you need tools

Melanie looks through the same drawer and touches Old Dolio’s
hand Bold move Old Dolio pulls away immediately - not sure
what just happened but not having it

OLD DOLIO
(awkwardterse)
I’m just here to do a job

It takes Melanie a moment to realize Old Dolio means it But
it hardly matters her hand felt good

Robert has turned the place upside down looking for a
checkbook - now he mimes to the others that it must be in the
bedroom He nods for Melanie to check the bedroom - she looks
ambivalent so he gestures for Old Dolio to go Melanie
watches Old Dolio walk down the hall unafraid

INT ABE’S BEDROOM CONTINUOUS 62

The shades are drawn half-light Abe’s eyes open wide when
she opens the door

ABE
(wheezing)
Don’t come in

But Old Dolio comes in anyway her eyes searching the room
for the checkbook She spies a desk with lots of promising
papers on it She’s about to take a closer look when

ABE (CONTD)
It’s hard I almost did it and then
I stopped It’s like trying to fall
asleep

It suddenly hits Old Dolio what’s happening here She
freezes uncertain then heads for the door

ABE (CONTD)
Keep going it sounds good Like
family Maybe some silverware
clinkingor play piano

She leaves the room

63 INT ABE’S LIVING ROOM CONTINUOUS 63

They all look expectantly at Old Dolio as she re-enters -
empty handed

OLD DOLIO
(whispers )
I think it’s in there But we have
to wait

Robert looks annoyed he looks at the time on his watch

ROBERT
It’s 315 We’ll miss the leak

OLD DOLIO
He’s trying to die

They all shift Melanie looks stricken wide-eyed Robert is
uneasy - the tables have been turned Abe is using them
Theresa almost doesn’t believe it Old Dolio is so calm

OLD DOLIO (CONTD)
Keep onhe wants silverware
clinking andpiano playing

Old Dolio heads to the kitchen to make clinking noises but
stops at the sound of beautiful piano music She turns slowly
to see Melanie playing at a small piano that had gone
unnoticed They are all mesmerized by the music After a
moment Theresa joins Old Dolio in making kitchen noises

THERESA
Hi hon how was school

MELANIE
It was fine I’m starving -

OLD DOLIO
Me too

THERESA
There’s leftover cake

Theresa noisily gets “cake” -- puts an empty plate and fork
on the piano and gives the same to Old Dolio who makes makes
fork noises against the plat Robert makes a cheering noise
in response to the game on TV The volume is on low

OLD DOLIO
(to Robert)
He scored

ROBERT
He scored a hole in one Can I get
some of that

THERESA
Do you want milk

Old Dolio gets the plate fork glass for Robert and they
both make the noises They are behaving like a family and
doing it gracefully now

ROBERT
I think I’11l mow the lawn tomorrow

THERESA
(good natured)
You said that last weekend

ROBERT
Did I

The three of them laugh

OLD DOLIO
Maybe I’11 just mow the -

Robert abruptly freezes holding up his hand - he’s
listening Melanie’s playing peters off He gestures for Old
Dolio to go back in check to see if it’s happened Old Dolio
goes in (Melanie could begin playing again here)

64 INT ABE’S BEDROOM 64
Old Dolio stands in the doorway The old man is very still

She comes closer Abe looks at her with some confusion he’s
still alive He’s whispering something Old Dolio bends down

ABE
(whispered)
Don’t do anything to the house My
kids have plans for it They’re not
bad kids Just busy

Old Dolio says nothing

ABE (CONTD)
No need to bother them Wait until
after

The old man breathes very laboriously Now he stops breathing
for a long time - is that it But then he starts again

ABE (CONTD)
Am I still here

OLD DOLIO
Yeah See how there’s light You’1l
know because it’1ll be dark all
around And quiet

Old Dolio can see Abe is struggling She sits down in the
chair beside the bed

OLD DOLIO (CONTD)
Life’s nothing Just let go without
really thinking about it Like
youre letting go of apiece of
string Just let it
(slip away she gestures)
not that big a deal

Old Dolio looks away to give him some privacy They sit there
for a while we are mostly on Old Dolio’s face It’s heavy

CUT TO

INT ABE’S LIVING ROOM A FEW MINUTES LATER 65

Old Dolio comes back in and they all become quiet She nods
he’s dead

Then a little chaos Robert hurries back to look for the
checkbook Melanie is freaking out

MELANTE
Oh my god Oh my god

She’s truly shocked as anyone would be Theresa comforts
her putting her arm around her sort of awkwardly

OLD DOLIO
What’s wrong

MELANIE
What’s wrong

OLD DOLIO
No I mean-

THERESA

She has tender feelings You don’t
know anything about that

(to Melanie)
I know

This hurts Old Dolio Theresa taps her chest when she says
“I” and Melanie notices she’s wearing poorly applied FAKE
NAILS that look similar to her own the ones Old Dolio broke
off - are they the same ones Old Dolio sees them too with
confusion Theresa drops her hand

THERESA (CONTD)
You feel sad is what you feel

Robert comes in from the bedroom frustrated

MELANIE
I’m not gonna do this again and I
don’t think we should take-

ROBERT

(interupting)
Somewhere there’s a checkbook in
this houseand when we find it
were just cashing out the whole
850 and be done with it ok
Because frankly this is making me
uncomfortable - I’ve been put in an
uncomfortable position here

(to Melanie)
You just sit down drink a glass of
water

Robert unhitches a cell phone from his holster and hands it
to Old Dolio

ROBERT (CONTD)
Go run the buckets There’s enough
time if you take the 52

Old Dolio feels strange about leaving Melanie with her
parents - like she’s been entirely replaced Theresa rubs
Melanie’s back

ROBERT (CONT’D)
Hurry

CUT TO

INTEXT DYNE BUILDING CONTINUOUS 66

Old Dolio enters the building just as the foam alarm goes off
on her watch so she doesn’t notice that she’s stepped on AN
ENVELOPE that has come through the slot She runs for a
bucket and keeps running scraping the bucket along the wall
to catch the pink foam as it oozes from the wall It’s a
three-person job so no matter how quickly tries to run back
with the next bucket there’s a mess She uses up all the
towels runs to the front of the room to get more But before
she can run back she hears a car pull up out front and thinks
it’s Melanie (dropping off her parents) She looks around
with panic at the mess Car doors slam outside But they
dont come so she goes to the foyerfront door and peeks out
It wasn’t Melanie it was Kelli and the Worker She’s kissing
him goodbye at work and heading down the street with her
purple folder As Old Dolio shuts the door and turns away she
feels something under her feet It’s an envelope She’s
surprised mail never comes here She opens it as she walks
quickly back into the main room with a cautious glance over
her shoulder It’s the 1575 insurance check from the
baggage scam She stares at the check runs her finger over
“Old Dolio Dyne” - it’s startling to see her name in type
like that attached to so much money Wide shot her alone in
this giant bleak room she looks around as if seeing it
clearly for what it is for the first time She has a sense
of power freedom and - suddenly - an idea about how to
rebel She heads to the door

CUT TO

EXT DYNE BUILDING CONTINUOUS 67

Once on the street Old Dolio is immediately faced with the
knotted tie hanging from Stovik’s gate

She quickly folds the check puts it in her back pocket just
as Stovik appears Old Dolio breaks into a run Stovik walks
with her and studies her as she hurries past His face
registers her inner landscape he looks surprised the tears
begin to flow

STOVIK
Jesus Your heart’s
poundingyou’reyou’reoh God
- run Don’t stop running young
flame That’s it

(MORE )

STOVIK (CONTD)
Don’t turn your head Don’t look at
me Run Run Don’t come back
Youre free
(to no one)
She’s free She did it

Old Dolio keeps running we watch her turn the corner Stovik
turns hearing a car coming down the street - it’s Melanie’s
car He quickly turns away

EXT DYNE BUILDING - A MOMENT LATER 68

Robert Theresa and Melanie are getting out of Melanie’s car
They’re all holding many cans of food from Abe’s Robert and
Theresa look defeated disappointed Melanie looks a little
spooked tries to hand off the cans glancing up at the
“Bubbles Inc” sign

MELANTE
I know it’s not money but there’re
some really good ones this looks
yummy —

Theresa and Robert quickly hush her and point to the tie on
the pole which explains nothing They unlock the door and
gesture for her to come in Melanie looks around still
holding the cans hesitant

MELANIE (CONTD)
Is she here

INT DYNE BUILDING CONTINUOUS 69

Robert and Theresa quickly put the cans away with hundreds of
others Robert checks the bubble wall and glances around Old
Dolio doesn’t seem to be here In a cubicle Theresa is taking
off her costume dress and putting on her regular clothes
Robert takes off his blazer costume They hang them in the
costume area Melanie puts the last can down slowly as she
notices the space They live here And clearly Old Dolio
isn’t here Which is disappointing

MELANTE
Where does she sleep

Theresa gestures to the cubicle Melanie cautiously goes in
it Robert is staring at Melanie from across the room and
Theresa is looking at him Theresa limps over to him

THERESA
(she nods towards Melanie)
There’s nothing to lose now

Robert looks at Theresa she looks him squarely back

ROBERT
She might do one more
THERESA
No So you shouldif you want

to
He’s moved by this she really knows him

ROBERT
How ‘bout wedo it together

Theresa smiles a big open relieved smile Then she touches
her stomach or hair A surprising insecurity

THERESA
Maybe you get the party started

Melanie is smoothing Old Dolio’s sleeping bag She studies
the things pinned to the inside of the cubicle - the “best
mom” card and the boy playing soccer that we’ve seen before
and next to those is Old Dolio’s wanted picture from the Post
Office with everything but her photo torn off Theresa calls
out from across the room Melanie quietly pockets the photo
of Old Dolio

THERESA (CONTD)
I have some errands to do

Theresa leaves Melanie comes out of Old Dolio’s cubicle

MELANIE
I don’t think Old Dolio likes me

ROBERT
Oh she doesn’t like anyone She’s
notlike that

of the fathers

FARIDA
How old is your son

FATHER

FARIDA
And what’s his name

FATHER
Cyrus Cy

Farida looks “Cy” in the eyes tenderly

FARIDA
Hi Cy

Old Dolio is watching completely mesmerized but playing it
cool The Father kind of pretends to hit Farida but laughs
nervously

FARIDA (CONT’D)
No that’s right -

FATHER
He would too He hits me if I try
to -

Farida gets down to “Cy’s” height

FARIDA
I’m going to observe first What do
I see - are you hungry No Are you
tired No You look excited Cy are
you excited to see the other kids
Do you need their attention

The father nods happily under Farida’s spell it’s easy to
feel like his son

FARIDA (CONTD)
Yeah And sometimes that’s enough
Just verbalizing the need is
enough

INT LATVIAN CHURCH AUDITORIUM - A FEW MINUTES LATER 71

Farida has just finished up with a Mother who is returning
to her seat moved there’s some light applause

FARIDA
All right we have time for one
more
(she glances around no
hands)

Or if there are no burning
questions we can move on to-

She starts to pick up her whiteboard pen but someone has
raised their hand

FARIDA (CONTD)
All right One more - what’s the
issue

A long pause we see people turn to see who’s taking so long
Then we hear her in a rough voice we’ve never heard before

OLD DOLIO
I think I might want totrade my
daughter for a better one

FARIDA
I’m sure everyone in here knows
that feeling

Murmurs of smiling agreement and knowing eye rolls Old Dolio
silences them with

OLD DOLIO
I said I think I might I might not
actually do it

Laughter Old Dolio smiles grimly

FARIDA
How old is your daughter

OLD DOLIO
(pause)
Eleven

Farida motions for Old Dolio to come up She goes up
perfectly imitating Theresa’s slight limp She stands
nervously in front of Farida

FARIDA
What’s her name

OLD DOLIO
Old Dolio

FARIDA
Old -

OLD DOLIO

Dolio We named her after a
homeless guy who won the lottery
so he would put her in his will
But Old Dolio — the Old Old Dolio -
used up all his money at the very
end Experimental cancer stuff

She’s quoting something she’s heard her parents say

FARIDA
And she’s-

This is all hard to say - she’s nervous not used to talking
like this

OLD DOLIO
She doesn’t know anything about
tenderness She’s a cold girl

Farida waits but that’s it So she begins

FARIDA
Hi Old Dolio

Farida really looks Old Dolio in the eye Old Dolio looks
scared but meets her eyes

OLD DOLIO
(in her own vulnerable
voice)

FARIDA
So again I’m just observing

Farida observes Old Dolio

INT DYNE BUILDING SAME MOMENT 72

Melanie sees the outfit Old Dolio wore on the plane She
notices all the furniture pulled away from one wall she
touches the wall it’s wet

ROBERT
It needs a little extra care It
spits up

Melanie glances around at the whole room in confusion

ROBERT (CONTD)
Just this wall Not all four walls -
that would be-
(laughs)
Can you imagine

Melanie isn’t sure what’s funny but she laughs a tiny bit as
she heads to the door and Robert laughs some more a little
forced he looks nervous

ROBERT (CONTD)

That was fun A good laugh

(he becomes totally

serious)
But you should know I’m not a
kidder or joker I can do that for
a job but I don’t think it’s
respectful If you ever see me
joking with someone you can bet I
think they’re a worthless asshole
not fit for real conversation

MELANIE
(smiles)
Well definitely don’t joke with me
then

ROBERT
(shaking his head)
See that was kind of a joke You
just shit a little on what I just
said Just a little to step back

Melanie’s smile drops she feels challenged She stops trying
to head out the door

ROBERT (CONTD)
Do you know how to be really
serious Have you ever been that
way with anyone You just touched
your phone

MELANIE
No I didn’t

ROBERT
You can’t help it it’s because of
the age you are You’ve never been
serious

Melanie becomes serious He takes this in

ROBERT (CONTD)
I’ve got something to show you

He nods his head in a direction walks that way and Melanie
walks with him intrigued

FARIDA
Are you worried No Do you want to
hold my hand

Old Dolio slightly shakes her head no

FARIDA (CONT’D)
Your hair is so long now Such
pretty long hair - can I brush it

Old Dolio gives a very tiny shrug Kelli Fain and The Leopard
and all the others watch As Farida reaches out Old Dolio
braces to endure this touching Farida mimes brushing
Gradually Old Dolio begins to relax - Farida sees this so
she just runs her hands through her hair again and again
This is a lot of sensation for Old Dolio her eyes glisten
she looks incredibly sad

There is a tremor

Old Dolio’s eyes widen with panic She’s always with Robert
and Theresa when these happen

FARIDA (CONTD)
Nothing to be afraid ofit’s just
a tremor

Farida reassures her with her eyes and keeps going with the
stroking but Old Dolio suddenly shakes her hand off and
looks at her with anger and judgement She looks out at the
whole class like What am I doing here She stumbles away and
out the door

INT DYNE BATHROOM SAME MOMENT 74

Melanie and Robert are standing in the bathroom looking at
the giant maroon jacuzzi Robert is watching the water
shaking from the quake when it stops he exhales

The jacuzzi is much too big for the space - it’s been plopped
down on the cement floor wedged between the sink and a
toilet stall Its underbelly is rough and exposed -
uninstalled The hose is attached to the sink faucet so it
hangs into the tub very slowly filling it

Melanie looks confused - this is the thing he wanted to show
her She bends down to see if it’s hooked up or -

ROBERT
It can drain There’s a drain right
under it In the floor

MELANIE
Are you returning it Or selling
itand then returning it And you
want me to

ROBERT
It’s better with the light off

He turns off the fluorescent light The room is lit by one
small window

ROBERT (CONTD)
Let’s take a bath

Melanie stares at him for a long time in the dim light She’s
been had

ROBERT (CONTD)
Are you surprised Maybe you didn’t
know I felt like this

MELANTE
No I’m the least surprised I’ve
ever been in my life

Without breaking her stare quietly furious

MELANIE (CONTD)
So what’s the plan You’1ll watch me
undress and start getting your dick
hard I’1l get in - well come on
(hurrying gesture)

Robert begins to quickly undress

MELANIE (CONTD)
Are you picturing soapy boobs
(she presses the button
for the jets)
Do these work No of course not
Sotitfuck blowjob

her butt)

It’s not clear if she’s serious or what she’s about to do

THERESA
(off camera)
We want this to be about your
pleasure too What feels good to
you

Melanie whips around Theresa is perched on the edge of the
tub clothed Robert is climbing into the tub Theresa takes
some deep breaths to calm Melanie while massaging Robert’s
shoulder with one hand

THERESA (CONTD)
You’reperfect You’re the best
example of a girl like you

Melanie looks into the distance the saddest look and then
suddenly lunges out of the bathroom making a break for it
Robert gets out too - lots of splashing

THERESA (CONT’D)
Hon no

Melanie is slightly hyperventilating as Theresa stands in
front of her

None of us saw this coming I think
were all equally surprised

Ok let’s not - please stay for a
snack -

Someone is at the front door Old Dolio tries to enter but
the chain stops her Robert lets her in She’s disturbed to
see Melanie in their space And there’s a strange vibe - they
all look busted

OLD DOLIO
What

ROBERT
What

OLD DOLIO
(she sniffs)
What were you guys doing Why are
there crackers on a plate

Melanie spies her keys they’re on the floor in Old Dolio’s
cubicle she can grab them on the way out the door but she’1l
have to pass Robert She starts to move that way -

THERESA
Don’t go hon

Theresa looks at Melanie and at the keys

OLD DOLIO
Hon You just - you’ve never called
me that

THERESA

I have I have called you that

OLD DOLIO
Oh Call me hon then

Theresa looks repulsed and put on the spot she grabs the
blue folder from Old Dolio’s hands it reads “Positive
Parenting Prenatal to Eighteen Years

THERESA
What is this

Old Dolio takes the folder back
OLD DOLIO
You can’t do it You can’t call me

OLD DOLIO (CONTD)
I’ve decided not to do it that way
this time

Old Dolio holds the check in front of Theresa

OLD DOLIO (CONTD)
It’s one word Just say it

Old Dolio is trying to be tough but it’s awful to want this
to ask for it Their eyes are locked

ROBERT
(to Theresa)
You could just say it

He sees it as an easy way to get the check but now Theresa
feels like they’re both ganging up as if she was a terrible
mother

THERESA
No I’m not going to just - we
don’t call you hon or sweetheart
or baby We don’t give birthday
presents wrapped up with little
bows -

OLD DOLIO
(interrupting)
I don’t want -

THERESA

Yes yes you wanted me to - what

weirdly snapping her

fingers)
That’s the kind of thing you want
right

OLD DOLIO
No

THERESA

Old Dolio shakes her head crumbling She bows her head and
starts to apologize -

OLD DOLIO

They all look at her
MELANIE (CONTD)
(eyes steady on Old Dolio)

Old Dolio looks from Melanie to Robert and Theresa who are
dismissive laughing at her attempt but Melanie isn’t
kidding around she’s not leaving Old Dolio with these
people Melanie urges her towards the door

and pillows that say “kindness” lots of magazines and little
rugs Melanie is making iced tea Old Dolio paces around like
an antsy animal glancing around - her folder still in hand
Melanie looks around too ambivalently

OLD DOLIO
Lots of stuff -

MELANIE
(before she finishes)
Yeah Yeah

Old Dolio picks up a disk-like thing from the counter

OLD DOLIO
What’s this

MELANTE
(winces a little)
It’s aIt’s a mug warmer Lots of
times my mom buys two of something
and sends me one

Old Dolio puts it down carefully Melanie hands her a glass
of ice tea Suddenly the distinctive “foam alarm” rings on
Old Dolio’s watch and she looks stricken

OLD DOLIO
Oh It’s Wednesday It leaks three
times on Wednesdays because they do
sanitation

She shuts her eyes grows pale

OLD DOLIO (CONTD)
It’s - it’s a three person job

Silence

pocket holding it out in the air waiting for it to ring

OLD DOLIO (CONT’D)
Once they put the buckets down

But actually the phone doesn’t ring Old Dolio has become
very anxious she finishes her tea

OLD DOLIO (CONT’D)
Well “thank you” or whatever I
should go back

Melanie’s face falls She just got her out of there Old
Dolio pulls a quarter out of her pocket and puts it on the
table Melanie looks confused

OLD DOLIO (CONTD)
It was probably more than that -
unless you bought it in bulk

MELANTE
You don’t pay for

Old Dolio looks pleasantly surprised puts the quarter back
in her pocket Melanie watches Old Dolio check her phone
again - they haven’t called

MELANIE (CONTD)
Youre “jonesing

OLD DOLIO
What

MELANIE
Youre addicted to them You can’t
be without them When my cousin
Timothy was trying to kick pills he
would be ok and then he’d have a
sudden wave of needing it really
bad

OLD DOLIO
I guess this is a little different
because they’re my parents

MELANIE
In what sense

OLD DOLIO
What

MELANTE
In what sense are they your
parents What’s an example

Old Dolio laughs because isn’t it obvious

OLD DOLIO
Wewealways split everything

MELANIE

heads to the door

Old Dolio can’t think of what

MELANIE (CONT’D)

shakes her head no but it’s too late Melanie stands really
close to Old Dolio

OLD DOLIO
Home

That conjures up such a bleak place it’s too much for
Melanie to bear - she has an idea

MELANIE
You thought I was going to take
that much for 3 nice words

Melanie hands the envelope back Old Dolio takes the money
uncertain but with some relief

MELANIE (CONTD)
This is a full service deal

for Old Dolio on the floor next to her own bed it has some
stuffed animals on it Old Dolio comes out of the bathroom in
her same clothes - the big shirt She looks at the bed
grimly she sees Melanie’s shorts and quickly looks away
Every aspect of this is new to her

Is it ok

Old Dolio looks sternly away from her

MELANIE (CONTD)
Oh - do you want to borrow - I have
pajamas

OLD DOLIO
Nope All good

Old Dolio can’t even look at Melanie in her indecent get-up
(and yet she also can’t look away)

What - what are you doing

She nods towards Melanie’s shorts

MELANTE
What do you mean

OLD DOLIO
Why are you - are you trying to
rile me up

MELANIE
These are what I wear to

Old Dolio suddenly gets in the bed very quickly fully
dressed and rolls over in a big huff tries to curl down
like she would in her sleeping bag The covers get all messed
up She’s getting increasingly flustered

OLD DOLIO
How do these even work - I can’t
even turn without them getting all-

Melanie tries to help her fixing the covers - without even
thinking Old Dolio moves her hand away grabbing her arm
kind of violently Melanie becomes very still They both look
at Old Dolio’s hand on Melanie’s arm Old Dolio slowly
releases it It’s the first time Old Dolio has touched her
or maybe anyone

It seems like feelings are rushing around inside her She
drops Melanie’s arm like a hot potato Melanie knows they
both felt something

looking at the door her watch Melanie quickly looks at the
list she has to keep Old Dolio bound in with it She crosses
off “pancakes” and turns off the stove “Breast Crawl” is
next

MELANIE (CONTD)
So this one I’m not sure -

Old Dolio looks at the list and tries to quickly rush through
it

OLD DOLIO
For that I can justcrawl out of
a dark room That’1l be fine

Old Dolio looks around the apartment for a dark room

86 INT MELANIE’S BEDROOM CONTINUOUS 86

Old Dolio is in the closet in Melanie’s bedroom We can see
her POV of Melanie through the slats in the closet door

MELANIE
This is another thing Theresa
didn’t do

OLD DOLIO

It’s the first thing she didn’t do
Id be probably less stressed out
if she’d done it

MELANTE
You feel like you’re stressed

Old Dolio demonstrates crawling out of the closet The

crawling is vaguely like the army-crawling the newborn did in
the video

OLD DOLIO
It’s completely dark and then I
come out into light and it’s
blinding
Old Dolio pats the floor

OLD DOLIO (CONTD)
This is the abdomen

Melanie touches the slats in the closet door
MELANIE
I know a place that’s darker than
this

Melanie rushes out of the bedroom grabs her keys Old Dolio
looks at the slats agonized at all this

MELANIE (CONTD)
It won’t take that long

CUT TO

87 EXT STREET (MELANIE’S CAR) - A FEW MINUTES LATER 87
Old Dolio isn’t looking happy in the passenger seat
OLD DOLIO

We’re so close to my - can’t you
just drop me

Melanie ignores this stays focused on the road Old Dolio
looks at her staring just a little too long at her intent
beautiful face Melanie looks up and she looks away quickly

OLD DOLIO (CONT’D)
How long have you been a driver

MELANIE
When did I learn Um 15 or 16 I
guess

OLD DOLIO
16
(thinks )
I guess that’s the normal age It
seems too young They should make
that higher

MELANTE
(casually)
I could teach you how

Slight wistfulness on Old Dolio’s part That version of life
is never going to happen

OLD DOLIO
I think probably you and I won’t
know each otherno offense

They both look pretty sad but especially Melanie

CUT TO

EXT “THE DRUNKEN PILOT” 30 MINUTES LATER 88

They head to the gas station bathroom the one next to the
bar they went to after the airport Melanie walks them past
the (un-manned) plaster sculptures over to the bathroom She
has a quarter ready for the door

INT GAS STATION BATHROOM CONTINUOUS 89

Pitch black We hear Old Dolio flipping the light switch it
still doesn’t work The following scene is in total darkness
a black screen with voices

OLD DOLIO
Well it’s dark but why the - this
was so farWe could’ve been done
by now

MELANTE
Exactly

OLD DOLIO
So I guess I’1l - I’1l1 crawl out -

Suddenly the sound of an earthquake

MELANIE
Just a tremor

Then there is a giant BOOM

OLD DOLIO MELANIE (CONTD)
No This one is building Out Get out -

OLD DOLIO
No no no no no don’t touch the
door or the walls everything is
live just stay in the middle

Shaking continues loud like thunder They are waiting it
out their breath is loud and terrified After some time the
shaking stops silence They sound different now - shocked

MELANIE
Is the doorknob -

OLD DOLIO
No it’s metal it’s live don’t
touch it Don’t touch it

A long silence Blackness We just hear their breathing

MELANTE
It’s so quiet I don’t hear anyone
A beat
OLD DOLIO
It is quiet Why is it so quiet
(pause)

It’s darker

MELANIE
It was dark before

OLD DOLIO
Noit’s completely black When
have you ever seen it this dark
(whispering to herself)
Oh my god Oh my god
No
(moans )

MELANTE
What what are you-

OLD DOLIO MELANIE (CONTD)

What

You don’t want to know

Silence

OLD DOLIO
Were not in life any more

MELANIE
What

OLD DOLIO
I think it happened right away
That first big boom

MELANIE
It - wha - it

OLD DOLI
We died

MELANIE

What I’m fine

OLD DOLIO
That’s what people always say
after They can’t believe it You
might never believe it But it’s
just going to be like this forever
Just us in blackness

MELANTE
Stop that’s not at all what’s-

OLD DOLIO
You can’t believe it because you
were married to life Hooked on it
I wasn’t hooked so it’s not such a
big deal

MELANIE
It would hurt

OLD DOLIO
I don’t think so

MELANTE
Please stop - I can feel my face
and

We hear them rubbing their faces

OLD DOLIO
Yeah - that’s just a memory

Some heavy breathing like Old Dolio is crying or trying not
to cry But when she speaks it’s with a biting bitter
righteousness

Silence

OLD DOLIO (CONTD)
I don’t have any regrets You’1ll
have regrets though You’1ll miss
sex and dancing and pancakes I
only had that one pancake so I’m
not gonna be sad You’1l be sad
forever Ill be fine You looked
in the mirror so many times you’1ll
miss your face forever I don’t
even remember my face I can’t even
say what I looked like

MELANTE
You had long sandy blonde hair Ice
blue eyes Long eyelashes and -

OLD DOLIO
(interrupting abruptly)
Shhh Just - doesn’t matter

MELANIE
And your skin is -

OLD DOLIO
(cutting her off)
You know I was just trying to rob
you -

MELANIE
No you —

OLD DOLIO
Yeah You’re such a stupid little
idiot Your brain is in your tits
The plan was for me to go with you
and stake out your apartment gain
your trust get access to your
account -

Suddenly there is the sound of radio music coming from a car
They can’t get to the door quickly enough they burst out of
the bathroom

CUT TO

EXT GAS STATION CONTINUOUS 90

It’s an ordinary-looking afternoon at the gas station A MAN
turns off the car the radio is silenced he gets out and
starts pumping gas He looks at them

MAN PUMPING GAS
You guys fine

MELANTE
Yeah Are you

MAN PUMPING GAS
I was driving Everyone just
stopped It was crazy

Old Dolio looks truly stunned - as if she had died and came
back to life She is shaking with energy

OLD DOLIO
We thought we were dead

MELANIE
(a little too
quicklydefensively)
I didn’t think that

OLD DOLIO
I’m Old Dolio

Old Dolio sticks out her hand and the man shakes it and
smiles and she just keeps shaking it and smiling back She is
ecstatic Everything is a miracle She is utterly sincere
here

OLD DOLIO (CONT’D)
It’s wonderful to meet you God
Bless you

MAN PUMPING GAS
Ok I’m not religious but -

OLD DOLIO
No me either I’ve never said that
before in my life How ‘bout this
right Do you think that was the
big one

MAN PUMPING GAS
I don’t know

MELANIE
I don’t think -

OLD DOLIO
(cutting her off)
It was That was it
(she laughs)
Thank you

MAN PUMPING GAS
Thanks

The man politely brings the hand shaking to an end

OLD DOLIO

Right right good I’m never going
to forget you for my whole life -
this -

(she gestures around to

the gas station his car)

A Subaru Ok I’ve memorized all of
this

Old Dolio notices the gas station minimart and heads towards
it Melanie balks - she’s still feeling hurt by Old Dolio’s

viciousness in the bathroom not to mention they were in the
middle of something

MELANIE
Ok can we -

But Old Dolio isn’t listening Melanie warily follows

CUT TO

INT GAS STATION MINIMART 91

A few things are knocked over the MINIMART CASHIER is
straightening up

MINIMART CASHIER
You guys ok

Old Dolio’s phone is ringing It’s Robert - she silences it
Melanie sees this

OLD DOLIO
Yes How are you

MINIMART CASHIER
Oh I’m fine These are great
structures for quakes

As he talks Old Dolio’s eyes are sliding over everything in
the store She takes a basket

MINIMART CASHIER (CONT’D)
Since we’re 24 hours we have to be
prepared for -

OLD DOLIO
(interrupting)
Have you tried everything in here

MINIMART CASHIER
No

Old Dolio is throwing things into the basket as she talks
Melanie feels invisible and frustrated unneeded Old Dolio
has so much to take in

OLD DOLIO
That’s what I would do if I worked
here It’s not too late You can
try everything once and isolate
your favorites and then just eat
those for some perfect days of
eating your favorite foods That’s
what I would do if I worked here
Do you have to apply or how’s that
work Do you need to do special
training or take a class

A CUSTOMER walks in

OLD DOLIO (CONTD)
Hi Come in come in

Old Dolio is talking to everyone but Melanie it’s as if
Melanie isn’t even there

INT GAS STATION MINIMART - TEN MINUTES LATER 92

Old Dolio has piled a massive amount of junk food on the
counter and the Minimart Cashier is ringing it up She’s
touching the packaging on the foods enjoying the sounds they
make

OLD DOLIO
I’m going pop this that’s how you
open it right Just pop

MINIMART CASHIER
That comes to 7983

Melanie watches Old Dolio take out the envelope of cash

MELANTE
That’s my money

It takes a moment for Old Dolio to catch up

OLD DOLIO
(to Minimart Cashier)
So actually no sale Should I put
everything back I’1l leave sorry

Melanie stands outside the front door avoiding this awkward
exchange Old Dolio follows her out a little sheepish

EXT GAS STATION MINI MART CONTINUOUS 93

OLD DOLIO
You know I didn’t evenI forgot
about that whole thing

MELANIE
Did you forget about robbing me

Old Dolio doesn’t know what she means and she’s distracted -
the Customer exits hovers looking at his phone and drinking
a Coke Old Dolio nods appreciatively at the Coke

MELANIE (CONTD)
(gesturing to bathroom)
You were just here to rob me to
gain access to my account
remember My brain is in my tits

OLD DOLIO
That was a lie
(looks at Melanie)
You don’t believe me

Melanie’s eyes are tired and guarded - it’s not that Melanie
doesn’t believe her it’s just that she’s been trying to get
Old Dolio’s attention for a while now

MELANIE
(tiredly)
NoI believe you

Melanie suddenly stands up and without a word walks towards
her car in the distance Old Dolio is surprised - she watches
her go She laughs hoarsely and looks at the Customer

The Customer glances at Melanie walking away pretty girl
and at Old Dolio then back at his phone Old Dolio feels
self-aware then looks with panic at Melanie getting further
away She follows after her

OLD DOLIO
No why would you What do you -
how can I prove it

As she walks she picks up a rock

OLD DOLIO (CONTD)
Do you want me to smash my finger
with this - I’ll do it

Melanie keeps walking doesn’t turn Old Dolio is thrown by
this new sensation It’s terrible unbearable Melanie is
really going to leave Old Dolio is breathing heavily unsure
of what she’s doing or why She sees a man pumping his gas is
watching Melanie too looking her up and down - this sparks a
sharp pain She stares down the man and follows Melanie

Melanie passes the same row of mass-produced “Greek”
sculptures she passed the first time she walked this way the
day she met the Dynes The sculptures all seem to watch her
again She’s so lovelorn She seems almost about to turn but
she forces herself to stay resolute taking out her phone
The moment she turns the ringer on it rings FaceTime we see
the screen it’s “MOM She answers

MELANIE
The ringer was off I’m fine Mom

MELANTIE’S MOM ON FACETIME
You’re ok You’re ok

MELANIE
I’m ok

MELANIE’S MOM ON FACETIME
Oh my goodness honey right

MELANIE
Right that was big

OLD DOLIO
(behind Melanie)
I’m sorry Come on stop

Melanie continues ignoring her holding her phone up and
walking to her car Old Dolio can’t do anything but follow
her They walk like this for a while Old Dolio getting more
desperate

MELANIE’S MOM ON FACETIME
I called the second I heard I’ve
been calling and calling - my heart
is still pounding It was just so -

OLD DOLIO
(behind Melanie)
I don’t know what to do What do I
do

MELANIE’S MOM ON FACETIME
(emotional pause)
I could use a squeeze

MELANIE
Squeeze squeeze Mama I’m sorry I

MELANIE’S MOM ON FACETIME
What what’s that behind you

Melanie sees on the phone screen in the background of the
video of herself a woman crawling We cut to Old Dolio
she’s army-crawling like the baby in the video It’s painful
pebbly cement They walk like this for a while with
Melanie’s Mom still on the phone watching

MELANIE’S MOM ON FACETIME (CONT’D)
Maybe you need to -

Melanie keeps walking for an excruciating beat Old Dolio
still crawling in the distance

MELANTE
Ok

MELANIE’S MOM ON FACETIME
Ok

Melanie hangs up stops walking turns around Old Dolio
finishes crawling to her painfully When she gets a few feet
away Old Dolio rests on her knees brushes off her hands
looks at Melanie Melanie takes out the envelope with the
list crosses off “Breast Crawl The last thing on the list
is “dance

CUT TO

INT MELANIE’S LIVING ROOM AFTERNOON ABOUT 45 MINUTES LATER

The apartment is a bit of a mess post-earthquake Nothing
major but things have fallen off shelves etc

No one has bothered to clean up - they are intent on what
they’re doing Melanie is sitting in a chair waiting Old
Dolio is standing in front of her nervous - like she might
not be able to do this

MELANTE
It’s hard without music - I can put
something on

OLD DOLIO
(reaching in her pocket)
No I - I have music

Melanie smiles watching her Old Dolio isn’t trying to leave
anymore They are on a sort of high together now - anything
feels possible

MELANTE
How old are you
OLD DOLIO
26 How old are you
MELANTE
27 What year were you born
OLD DOLIO

MELANTE

Me too 91 Best year
Old Dolio laughs

MELANIE (CONTD)
You liked me You liked me all

along

OLD DOLIO
Did I I don’t -

MELANIE
Ok but now

OLD DOLIO
Well yeah

MELANIE
Yeah

Old Dolio just nods looking serious Melanie’s heart skips a
beat

MELANIE (CONTD)
Ok You dance and that’1ll be the
last thing and then we can

OLD DOLIO
What

MELANTE
Do anything we want Go out to
lunch

Old Dolio laughs - this is really such a mind boggling idea

MELANIE (CONTD)
Or take a hikeI love to hike in
Runyon Canyon

Another wild and funny idea to Old Dolio

MELANIE (CONTD)
Or go to the beach

OLD DOLIO
(nods taking in the new
freedom)
Oh man We’re like rich people
Like kajillionairesjust doing
whatever we please Let’s go to New
York together and just walk around

MELANIE
Yeah

OLD DOLIO
I’m kidding

MELANIE
But we could

They look at each other it’s serious There is a strong
sexual tension between them Old Dolio takes out her phone
and dials

HOLD RECORDING
(speakerphone)
“Thank you for calling Publishers
Clearing House please hold for the
next available representative”

The familiar hold music plays

OLD DOLIO
They never pick up
Old

Dolio begins to move with painful self-consciousness But

it’s not dancing - it’s the movements required to dodge the
security cameras at the post office They are completely
abstract in this unrelated space rolls ducks sudden turns

She
and
and
her

repeats the sequence again and again as the music builds
in time she becomes emotional - angry desperately sad
un-careful Melanie watches her with great feeling and in
eyes Old Dolio feels braver and braver

Suddenly there is a knock at the door Old Dolio stops

THERESA OS
(whispers )
Oh thank Godshe’s
(calling out)
Old Dolio Can you hear us

Old Dolio turns off the music Neither of them move More
knocking
ROBERT OS
We’ve been calling That was it -
the big one Are you ok
THERESA OS
Are you hurt
Old Dolio is grimly silent

ROBERT OS
We brought you some things -

THERESA OS
Yes they’rethings we should
have given you a long time ago

A long silence everyone’s waiting Then there is some
muffled talking between Robert and Theresa that we can’t
really hear Finally

THERESA OS (CONTD)
You’re not ready to talk yet
That’s ok We’ll leave these in the
hall
(pause)
All right we’re going now

Melanie and Old Dolio wait Melanie presses her ear against

the

door

MELANTE
(whispering)
I think they’re gone

OLD DOLIO
They know how to make it sound like
they’ve left They could be right
there waiting for us to open the
door

MELANIE
God

Old Dolio looks ashen doomed

OLD DOLIO
I should have just taken my third
525

Old Dolio unlocks and opens the door They’re actually gone
Three big Target shopping bags fall into the apartment They
drag them in and cautiously look inside They’re filled with
wrapped presents with little cards on them “Happy Birthday
Our little girl is 3 Love Mommy and Daddy” “Happy Birthday
Our little girl is 8” Old Dolio rips open “Our little girl
is 14 It’s a make-up kit for a teenager She opens another
for a 4 year old - it’s a doll with clothes Each of these
things is brand new

Melanie looks really nervous and suspicious But Old Dolio is
unwrapping all the presents now with great focus one after
another

INT MELANIE’S LIVING ROOM - A FEW MINUTES LATER 95

The unwrapped gifts are all lined up in a row across the
room Dolls games CDs clothes makeup jewelry Old Dolio
stares at it

MELANTE

Newborn

(she points to a rattle)
-one two

(she counts off the

presents whispering)
-to seventeen

(she walks down to a

makeup kit)

There seems to be a missing gift - there’s just a card

OLD DOLIO
Where’s the eighteenth one

Melanie looks at Old Dolio who seems too taken by the toys
she’s looking at each card

MELANIE
This is crap They’re just -

OLD DOLIO
I know I know that It’s some kind
of job They’re jobbing me

She reads the 18th birthday card

OLD DOLIO (CONTD)
“Happy Birthday Our”
(she reads in her head)
They want to take me out to dinner
both of us They made a reservation
at Melisse For myoh “18th”
birthday

Old Dolio falls deep into thought imagining facing off with
them at a restaurant

MELANIE
Is it your birthday

OLD DOLIO
Probably not

MELANTE
(gets serious again)
Don’t go They won’t even be there
Or they will and you’1l have to
pay Something like that

But she looks at Old Dolio and realizes she will go she’s
already there in her mind

MELANIE (CONTD)
You should leave the money here
Just to be sure they don’t

Old Dolio hears this and quickly walks around the apartment
scanning the place taping walls She slides her finger along
the inside of the mirror and slips the envelope in there

OLD DOLIO
They think I don’t know anything
about that sort of fancy
restaurant
(shakes her head ruefully)
Well just walk in and they’1l be
like Wow who even are you now

Melanie looks at her and doesn’t say anything Old Dolio
looks down at her clothes The same as they’ve always been

CUT TO

INT MELISSE FORTY MINUTES LATER 96

Old Dolio and Melanie stand awkwardly by the hostess stand
Old Dolio awkward in a pretty fluttery dress clearly
borrowed from Melanie It looks all wrong on her

OLD DOLIO
They’1l probably be late it’s
three bus rides

But Robert and Theresa are waving from a table They are
dressed nicely a look we haven’t seen before Theresa looks
relieved to see her daughter

The Hostess leads them back

OLD DOLIO (CONTD)
(to Hostess)
Oh usually I like to sit more in
the back but this table is fine

Old Dolio and Melanie look at each other with complicity -
they’re in on this together Old Dolio is treating this like
a job playing a role Robert and Theresa watch this with
slight confusion as normal parents might

WAITRESS
Can I start you off with some
drinks
OLD DOLIO
Yes Do you still have theport
WAITRESS
The Colheita Or the Tawny “20
Year
OLD DOLIO
(slightly garbles the
name )

The Colheita

A twinkle from Melanie who is enjoying her performance
Robert and Theresa smile a little uneasily at Old Dolio’s
showiness the waitress smiles knowingly kids

Melanie touches Old Dolio’s foot with her foot Old Dolio is
nervous and excited by this Maybe this dinner is really
about the two of them

ROBERT
(openly awkward scanning
the wine list nervously)
Ill haveoh wow I
guessnothing actually Water

THERESA
Water for me

MELANTE
Ill have a Coke please

Robert and Theresa have trouble looking at Melanie - as if
she is a bad influence on their daughter

INT MELISSE’S - TEN MINUTES LATER 97

There is the task of looking at the menu deciding
conferring - everyone does this almost like a regular
family The waitress takes their order

OLD DOLIO
(proudly)
--and for the 3rd course I’1l1 have
my usualwhich is”the Dry Aged
Prime New York steak”

ROBERT
Sorry “fromage” is

Old Dolio knows them why is he being so “honest” What’s the
angle

WAITRESS
That’s a cheese plate
ROBERT
(maybe hits his head like
“duh” )
It’s the French word fordirect
translation

Waitress smiles Old Dolio can tell she thinks they’re a
normal family She looks at everyone at her own table and
then at the family at the table next to them Now we are at
that table

ANOTHER MOM
I didn’t realize it would be so
fatty -

ANOTHER DAUGHTER
It’s the good kind of fat Mom

Were moving to another family at another table maybe
Asian

ANOTHER FATHER
No the remake is terrible I’m
talking about the original -

ANOTHER SON
Oh the original is-

ANOTHER FATHER
- that’s a little piece of history

We see the unique dynamic of each family just by watching
them for a few seconds

ANOTHER TEENAGE GIRL
Yeah but she’s taking a gap year
so she won’t even be there at the
same time as him

We are passing as a family but we aren’t real like them Old
Dolio thinks looking at another family - and then the young
daughter of this family glances back at Old Dolio because
she’s looking at them Old Dolio takes a sip of water

INT MELISSE’S - FORTY-FIVE MINUTES LATER 98
The waitress is clearing the table
THERESA
Oh Isn’t that the woman who
massaged you

A familiar waitress is walking by holding plates - it’s
Jenny the masseuse She sees Old Dolio and pauses

JENNY
Hi

OLD DOLIO
Hi

Old Dolio is embarrassed and Melanie sees this and can’t
help but feel a little confused and betrayed

Old Dolio tries to do the foot-touching thing under the table
but Melanie pulls her foot in

ROBERT
The healing arts That’s a solid
profession because there are always
people in pain

THERESA
What do your parents do Melanie

Melanie just stares at her For the first time Old Dolio
notices the new hatred Melanie has for Robert and Theresa
But Melanie only wants the jacuzzi event buried so she’s
trying to be civil

MELANIE
My mom’s in real estate

THERESA
Oh Robert used to -

ROBERT
I used to publish a resource guide
for real estate agents with
coupons

THERESA
We were straight shooters back then

ROBERT
Wellif we’re being honest

Robert and Theresa look at each other uncertainly

THERESA
We had some tough times The coupon
book didn’t -

ROBERT
We were reacting to the era -

This all seems questionable to Melanieshe checks with Old
Dolio But Old Dolio is on the edge of her seat

OLD DOLIO
Can I see the coupon book

THERESA
Of course the culture’s changed so
we seem out of step now -

ROBERT
But it might change back again

As they talk Old Dolio notices the PENGUIN STAMPS on the back
of their hands

OLD DOLIO
(pointing to the stamp)
You went to the class

ROBERT
Oh right We saw the girl with the-
(mimes pregnant)
- she was going in and we just-

THERESA
It seemed like it was important to
you you were trying to tell me and
I couldn’t -

ROBERT
And we met your friend

Robert has taken a box of toothpicks out of his pockets and
is offering them around Old Dolio watches Theresa takes one

ROBERT (CONTD)
What was hisPanther

OLD DOLIO
The Leopard

ROBERT
Right The Leopard

THERESA
(voice frail)
It was so much shaking wasn’t it
And loud

OLD DOLIO
Yeah

THERESA
I knew you were scared The whole
time I was thinking Where is she
Where is she

Despite herself Old Dolio feels guilty It seems like they
really were worried Melanie is uneasy noticing this
shift

Robert takes a little box out of Theresa’s purse and hands it
to Old Dolio It’s the missing gift

It’s a necklace with a little gold rose on it Old Dolio puts
it on Melanie watches with surprise And Theresa is watching
too she looks slightly concernedshe leans over to
Melanie

THERESA (CONTD)
It’s returnable

Right then Robert Jenny and eventually Theresa start to sing
Happy Birthday it starts in the disorienting way it always
does - what is happening - but soon it is clear Jenny is
bringing a slice of cake with a candle on it and all the
other tables we visited are smiling watching them Everyone
really believes in this moment She’s faced with the candle
she and Melanie make eye contact and Melanie seems to be
urging her not to wish for what she’s going to wish for but
she wishes for it anyway blowing out the candle And clink
clink now Robert is making a toast standing

ROBERT

Thirty six hours ago I was - we
were both - soangry at you I
see now that was just a base
response - fear really just fear
And thenwell The big one
happened Andthis is hardI’m
not great at this I - we -

(Theresa and Robert look

at each other)
got worried We didn’t think you
were dead butwell if you were
dead I would have regretted not
doing more things to show you

He’s practically gasping for air this is so difficult for
him People in the restaurant are starting to turn and watch
the man standing up baring his heart Old Dolio realizes
this might be real and she’s just frozen watching her eyes
filled with painful feeling Other families are watching
other daughters and fathers are moved and tearful and
jealous

ROBERT (CONTD)

I guess I always felt like it would
be insulting to treat you like a
kid or I just - I didn’t know how
to do my role it seemed insincere
and I thought we agreed on that
But then after theI kept
thinking I just want to hold her
face like this

(cups his hands in the

air)
That dear face

Everyone in the room is moved He looks at his hands and
laughs

ROBERT (CONTD)

Don’t worry I won’t - or maybe I
should -

(flustered)
We’re so lucky to get to have you
as our daughter

(a breath)
Old Dolio Dyne

(voice cracking)
Will you let us be your parents

Old Dolio looks at her mom searchingly - Theresa has been
watching her daughter intently with welling eyes she nods
ever so slightly as if to say yes believe it Melanie is
disappointed it was easier when Robert was all bad

OLD DOLIO
I-

She hesitates scared

THERESA
It’s too much You don’t have to
decide now

ROBERT
Or ever

As everyone clinks Robert is bent over making noises - for

an awful moment it seems like he’s laughing it’s all been a
joke - but no there are real tears He’s sobbing Old Dolio
can’t believe it

ROBERT (CONTD)
(choking)
I’m so sorry

Old Dolio doesn’t know what to do she’s crying herself
Theresa rubs him on the back Old Dolio pats him too Melanie

is looking at her with disbelief Old Dolio gives her a
helpless little smile

CUT TO
INT MELANIE’S BEDROOM A FEW MINUTES LATER 99

Old Dolio is being tucked into the little bed next to
Melanie’s - by her parents Melanie watches from afar

ROBERT
Good night sweet daughter

THERESA
Have wonderful dreams

They are trying these things out shyly All three of them
are a little nervous and self-conscious Melanie watches from
a distance -- this is all excruciating to her and she doesn’t
hide it Robert and Theresa are standing quite close to the
place in the wall where the money is hidden Does Old Dolio
notice Melanie certainly does

OLD DOLIO
In the morning I could if you
want make pancakes

Robert and Theresa both immediately look a little confused
Theresa looks slightly pained Old Dolio can’t read them -
maybe she said something wrong Or maybe

OLD DOLIO (CONT’D)
Tomorrow’s Friday The check I

cashed it but we haven’t spent
any

Melanie’s stares at her in disbelief Old Dolio trails off
THERESA
Don’t worry about rent We’re the

parents we’ll handle it

ROBERT
Weve got a plan

OLD DOLIO
Oh

She waits to hear the plan but they’re tight-lipped
OLD DOLIO (CONTD)
Then I’1l just um see you

tomorrow

They nod yes yes

INT MELANIE’S BEDROOM - A FEW MINUTES LATER 100

From the bedroom Old Dolio watches Melanie shut the door
behind Robert and Theresa lock it listen to the door

Then she hovers by the place where Old Dolio hid the money
She starts to check it when Old Dolio shifts making a noise
Melanie’s hand pauses They look at each other

MELANIE
So if it’s gone then they are
monsters and the whole night was a
lie Ok

OLD DOLIO
But if it’s still therethen it’s
all real You’1l believe that

Melanie nods and her hand reaches for the wall again Old
Dolio looks so nervous scared of the truth

OLD DOLIO (CONTD)

Wait If it’s just my third if
it’s 525 that means “We can only
ever be like we are but we love you
and we wish you well”

Melanie looks sad Poor Old Dolio she’s just radically
lowered her expectations But this would be enough (love) to
get by on Melanie reaches in the hiding place She pulls
outall the money It’s all there Melanie can’t believe
it she looks tricked almost angry Old Dolio is radiant -
she can count on them Melanie changes into her pajamas
behind Old Dolio Old Dolio can feel this

OLD DOLIO (CONT’D)

Ill probably head home on the
early side before you’re up
Sothanks for everything Really

MELANTE
No problem

Melanie climbs in bed turns out the light Everything is
still for a moment

Both of them lying in the dark eyes open (Old Dolio in her
bed on the floor) Melanie shifts rearranging her legs Old
Dolio stares at her legs coming out of her little boxers
Many micro-movements from both a growing sexual tension
Melanie finally turns towards Old Dolio looks at her in the
dark Old Dolio is breathing heavily Melanie turns back
maybe groaning very slightly We can feel that both of them
are extremely turned on But nothing happens

CUT TO

101 INT MELANIE’S BEDROOM THE NEXT MORNING 101

A stumbling noise Old Dolio has her shoes on and is about to
sneak open the bedroom door and leave Melanie sees and gets
up quickly -

MELANIE
Please don’t -

But she falls silent as she follows Old Dolio into the next
room because

102 INT MELANIE’S LIVING ROOM CONTINUOUS 102

it’s empty The entire living room is stripped bare no
furniture nothing - except the row of seventeen gifts
Melanie is in shock Old Dolio is shattered but almost
immediately hardens Of course She checks the hiding place -
the money is gone Melanie sees too Old Dolio becomes
really really sad She can’t ever know Robert and Theresa
now She really has nothing She walks out to the balcony and
sees a little box of toothpicks on the railing She goes back
in and watches Melanie opening the cupboards where all her
dishes were Old Dolio feels terrible - she brought this on -
and scared she’s fighting tears Melanie sees this look and
something rises up in her

MELANTE
(casual shrug)
So what

Old Dolio caught off guard laughs tearfully And Melanie
laughs a little It’s that laughter that only makes sense in
a crisis in shock -- so intimate that physical intimacy
suddenly seems possible

They are half awake half dressed laid bare in the early
morning light Melanie walks over to Old Dolio stands near
her for a while looks at her lips Old Dolio looks down
looks at Melanie’s hands they touch hands a little Melanie
comes closer they get very serious Old Dolio looks really
quite nervous Maybe she touches Melanie in some unpracticed
way there is some feverish touching but no kissing - and
thensomething behind Melanie catches her eye Melanie
turns to see what she’s looking at

Old Dolio reaches around to one of the three empty shopping
bags With two fingers she pulls out a very long gift
receipt

CUT TO

INT TARGET AN HOUR LATER 103

Old Dolio and Melanie stand at the returns desk the big bags
on the counter As the cashier rings up the toys and clothes
Old Dolio intently watches the digital display of the cash
register They both watch as it goes up and up 40556
43555it feels more and more like everything rides on
this and then the last item is rung up 48505 Old Dolio’s
face falls Melanie feels terrible for her The cashier is
looking at the gift receipt

CASHIER
So you’re keeping thesomething
from the jewelry department

Old Dolio draws a blank but Melanie steps right up to her
face and looking her in the eye reaches around her neck
the tiny gold rose necklace The clasp takes a moment and
Melanie’s face is very close to Old Dolio’s Their lips are
so close Melanie hands the necklace to the cashier They are
about to kiss Old Dolio glances back at the new total
52500 They kiss

CUT TO BLACK
