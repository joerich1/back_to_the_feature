THE PALACE OF THE DUKE DE MEDICIS THE MANSION OF DUKE
BRACCIANO THE CATHEDRAL ALL AGLOW IN A MAGICAL SUNSET

ANGLE ON THE LOWER DEPTHS OF THESE CASTLES AND PALACES

LOWER DEPTHS EXT DAY

THREE MEN attempt to force their way through the GATE of
a tall razor-wire fence The sounds of a PARTY can be
heard at a distance

LODOVICO toughest of the three swipes his ID CARD in the
door’s card reader A SCREEN lights up featuring LODOVICO’s
dissipated villanous face his name and details and the
flashing word repeated BANISHED

LODOVICO
Banished

ANGLE ON HIS HENCHMEN
Bleached-blond tough guys

ANTONELLI
It grieves me much to see the sentence

LODOVICO swipes his card repeatedly The screen vanishes

GASPARO
But you are justly doomed
You have acted certain murders
Bloody and full of horror

ANGLE ON CATWALKS

Stretching back and forth above them the thud-thud of cars on
an overpass above that

LODOVICO indicates two figures on an upper catwalk
They are the DUKE OF BRACCIANO and his secretary FLAMINEO
The two men speak in whispers

LODOVICO
So - I wonder then some great men escape
This banishment Theres Paulo Giordano Ursini
The Duke of Bracciano
Who by close panderism seeks to prostitute
The honour of Vittoria Corombona -
ANGLE ON GASPARO AND ANTONELLI
Banging on the gate trying to attract attention to be let in

GASPARO
Oh sir

BRACCIANO and FLAMINEO ignore them They head along the
catwalk to a tall industrial building from which the PARTY
SOUNDS emanate
ANGLE ON LODOVICO
Staring at his betters as they disappear from sight
LODOVICO
Ill make Italian cut-works in their guts
If ever I return

ANGLE ON FLAMINEO

He swipes his ID card The red light turns to green
The screen says WELCOME

The door swings open BOUNCERS and SOLDIERS usher BRACCIANO
and FLAMINEO into a -

FABULOUS PARTY INT NIGHT

- where they are surrounded by DUKE BRACCIANO’S ENTOURAGE
BRACCIANOs style is that of a Colombian drug lord circa
1986 He flaunts it with a fur coat a satin suit a silk
scarf gold-rimmed shades and much jewelry

FLAMINEO wears a dark tie and dark suit like Sydney Falco

They scene is an old power house full of TV MONITORS which
display clips and images of the celebrity participants

BRACCIANO can’t take his eyes off VITTORIA COROMBONA
a compelling beautiful woman who is the centre of
attention at every gathering

ANGLE ON CAMILLO

An older henchman-politician VITTORIA’s husband seeking
BRACCIANO’s support for something

CAMILLO
Your best of rest
PHOTOGRAPHERS start snapping pictures of VITTORIA
She directs the PAPERAZZI to BRACCIANO

VITTORIA
Unto my lord the duke
The best of welcome More lights Attend the duke

FLASHBULBS POP

VITTORIA and CAMILLO start to bicker For just a moment
she and DUKE BRACCIANO lock eyes

ANGLE ON FLAMINEO

BRACCIANOs secretary and VITTORIAs brother adjusting
his tie

BRACCIANO
Flamineo

FLAMINEO
My lord

BRACCIANO
(staring at VITTORIA)
Quite lost Flamineo

FLAMINEO
Pursue your noble wishes I am prompt
As lightning to your service O my lord
(whispers)
The fair Vittoria my happy sister
Shall give you present audience -

BRACCIANO
Are we so happy

FLAMINEO
Can it be otherwise
Observed you not tonight my honoured lord
Whichever way you went she threw her eyes
I have dealt already with her chambermaid
Zanche the Moor and she is wondrous proud
To be the agent for so high a spirit

ON THE MONITORS ABOVE THEM A TV MONTAGE

the images of VITTORIA COROMBONA stand out attending functions

throwing parties she is always immaculate composed

BRACCIANO
We are happy above thought because above merit
FLAMINEO
Above merit We may now talk freely

What is it you doubt Her coyness Thats but

the superficies of lust most women have yet why

should ladies blush to hear that named which

they don’t fear to handle
CuT TO -

LIMO INT NIGHT

BRACCIANO and FLAMINEO sit drinking and plotting

FLAMINEO
O they are politic they know our desire

is increased by the difficulty of enjoying -

BRACCIANO
Oh but her jealous husband -

WIPE TO -

VITTORIAS MANSION INT NIGHT

Modest in size Tastefully done SERVANTS take thei

FLAMINEO stays close to his boss

FLAMINEO
Hang him

They enter an -

AQUARIUM INT NIGHT

- with several big tanks filled with fighting fish

Four sunken sofas in the middle of the room

FLAMINEO
Shroud you within this closet good my lord
Some trick now must be thought on to divide
My brother-in-law from his fair bed-fellow

BRACCIANO
Oh should she fail to come -

FLAMINEO
I must not have your lordship thus unwisely
amorous ‘Tis just like a summer bird-cage

in a garden the birds that are without despair

to get in and the birds that are within

r coats
fear they shall never get out
Away away my lord

FLAMINEO hides BRACCIANO behind one of his fish tanks
CAMILLO enters He is now the host pleased that the party
has moved on to his home

FLAMINEO
See here he comes This fellow by his apparel
Some men would judge a politician -
(embraces CAMILLO)
How now brother
What travelling to bed with your kind wife

CAMILLO
I assure you brother no
I do not well remember I protest
When I last lay with her

FLAMINEO
Strange you should lose your count

CAMILLO
We never lay together but ere morning
There grew a flaw between us

FLAMINEO
It had been your part
To have made up that flaw

CAMILLO
True but she loathes I should be seen in it

FLAMINEO
Why sir whats the matter

CAMILLO
The duke your master visits me - I thank him
And I perceive how like an earnest bowler
He very passionately leans that way
He should have his bowl run

FLAMINEO
I hope you do not think -

CAMILLO
That nobleman bowl booty Faith his cheek
Hath a most excellent bias it would fain
Jump with my mistress

FLAMINEO
Will you be an ass
Despite your Aristotle
ANGLE ON BRACCIANO

On the other side of the fish tank watching his RIVAL
up by his SECRETARY

CAMILLO
This doth not physic me -

FLAMINEO
It seems you are jealous Ill show you the
error of it by a familiar example I have
seen a pair of spectacles fashioned with such
perspective art that lay down but one twelve
pence twill appear as if there were twenty
Now should you wear a pair of these spectacles
and see your wife tying her shoe you would
imagine twenty hands were taking up of your
wifes clothes and this would put you into
a horrible causeless fury

CAMILLO
The fault there sir is not in the eyesight

FLAMINEO
True but they that have the yellow jaundice
think all objects they look on to be yellow
Jealousy is worse -

VITTORIA in a new evening outfit enters the den

FLAMINEO
(indicates his sister)
See she comes what reason have you to be
jealous of this creature Lock up this wife
Bar her the sound of revels

He waves to VITTORIA She waves back at him ignores
her husband

FLAMINEO
Be wise I will make you friends and you
shall go to bed together Walk you aloof -

He hustles CAMILLO towards the nearest fish tank
Then loosening his tie he saunters towards VITTORIA
who is being served drinks and canapes

FLAMINEO
Sister -
(takes a canape a glass of champagne
whispers )
My lord attends you

wound
(aloud)
Your husband is wondrous discontented

VITTORIA
I did nothing to displease him I carved
to him at supper-time

FLAMINEO
(whispered)
You need not have carved him they say he’s
a capon already I must now seemingly fall
out with you
(aloud for CAMILLOs benefit)
Shall a gentleman so well descended as Camillo
(whispered)
that lousy slave -

ANGLE ON CAMILLO
Watching the reflections of his WIFE and her BROTHER

CAMILLO
Now he begins to tickle her

ANGLE ON VITTORIA AND FLAMINEO
Intimate whispery and giggly

FLAMINEO
An excellent scholar - is he not a courtly
gentleman

(whispers )
When he wears white satin one would take him
by his black muzzle to be no other creature
than a maggot

ANGLE ON CAMILLO
Staring at their reflections in the fish tank

FLAMINEO
(louder )
Come my lord attends you thou shalt go
to bed to my lord

CAMILLO
Now he comes to it

FLAMINEO
Thou shalt lie in a bed stuffed with turtles
feathers swoon in perfumed linen like the
fellow was smothered in roses So perfect
shall be thy happiness that as men at sea
think land and trees and ships go that way
they go so both heaven and earth shall seem
to go your voyage Shalt meet him tis fixed
with nails of diamonds to inevitable necessity

VITTORIA
(whispers )
How shalt rid him hence

FLAMINEO

I will put breeze in his tail set him gadding
presently

(to CAMILLO)
I’ve almost wrought her to it I find her
coming but might I advise you now for this
night I would not lie with her I would cross
her humour to make her more humble

CAMILLO
Shall I shall I

FLAMINEO
It will show in you a supremacy of judgment
(winks )
Walk by her in the noblemans fashion and tell
her you will lie with her at the end of the
progress

CAMILLO nods turns to VITTORIA

CAMILLO
Vittoria I cannot be induced or as a man
would say incited -

VITTORIA
To do what sir

CAMILLO
To lie with you tonight Your silkworm used
to fast every third day and the next following
spins the better To-morrow at night I am
for you

VITTORIA
Youll spin a fair thread trust to it

CAMILLO
(whispers to FLAMINEO)
Tell me tomorrow how scurvily she takes
my unkind parting

FLAMINEO
I will
CAMILLO
(winks at FLAMINEO)
Did you not mark the jest of the silkworm
Good night - in faith I will use this trick
often

FLAMINEO
Do do do

Exit CAMILLO FLAMINEO goes to his sister kisses her

FLAMINEO
So now you are safe

He beckons her to follow him

FLAMINEO
Come sister darkness hides your blush
Women are like cursed dogs let loose at
midnight then they do most good or most
mischief My lord my lord

BRACCIANO appears between the fish tanks He reads aloud
from a poem he has texted on his mobile phone

BRACCIANO
(scrolling reading)
I could wish time would stand still
And never end this interview this hour
But all delight doth itself soonest devour

ZANCHE VITTORIAs very sexy super-competent personal
assistant lays a silk sheet across the sofas and two fair
cushions

Enter CORNELIA - VITTORIA and FLAMINEO’s mother - unseen
behind the fighting fish

BRACCIANO
(reading sitting)
Let me into your bosom happy lady
Pour out instead of eloquence my vows
Loose me not madam for if you forgo me
I am lost eternally

VITTORIA
Sir in the way of pity
I wish you heart-whole

BRACCIANO
You are a sweet physician
VITTORIA
Sure sir a loathed cruelty in ladies
Is as to doctors many funerals
It takes away their credit

BRACCIANO
Excellent creature
We call the cruel fair what name for you
That are so merciful

ANGLE ON FLAMINEO AND ZANCHE

They have stepped back but not very far
From behind the tanks they spy on their masters

ZANCHE
See now they close

FLAMINEO
(nuzzling ZANCHEs neck)
Most happy union
ANGLE ON VITTORIA RECLINING ON ZANCHES CUSHIONS

BRACCIANO studies one of her earrings

BRACCIANO
What value is this jewel

VITTORIA
Tis the ornament of a weak fortune

BRACCIANO

In sooth Ill have it nay I will but change

My jewel for your jewel
FLAMINEO and ZANCHE grow more passionate

FLAMINEO
Excellent
His jewel for her jewel - well put in duke

BRACCIANO offers VITTORIA something scintilating
super-valuable

BRACCIANO
Nay let me see you wear it

VITTORIA
Here sir

BRACCIANO
Nay lower you shall wear my jewel lower
ZANCHE
Thats better - she must wear his jewel lower

VITTORIA responds to BRACCIANOs taste in jewelry placement -
then she breaks away A troubled expression clouds her
fabulous face Behind her the fighting fish circle

VITTOIRA
Ill tell your grace
A dream I had last night

BRACCIANO
Most wishedly

VITTORIA
A foolish idle dream
Methought I walked about the mid of night
Into a churchyard where a goodly yew-tree
Spread her large root in ground Under that yew
As I sat sadly leaning on a grave
Chequered with cross-sticks there came stealing in
Your duchess and my husband one of them
A pickaxe bore the other a rusty spade
And in rough terms they gan to challenge me
About this yew

BRACCIANO
That tree

VITTORIA
This harmless yew
They told me my intent was to root up
That well-grown yew and plant instead of it
A withered blackthorn and for that they vowed
To bury me alive My husband straight
With pickaxe ‘gan to dig and your fell duchess
With shovel like a Fury voided out
The earth and scattered bones Lord how methought
I trembled and yet for all this terror
I could not pray

FLAMINEO
No the devil was in your dream

FLAMINEO making love to ZANCHE is excited by his SISTERs
story

In their tanks the fighting fish become more frenzied
VITTORIA

When to my rescue there arose methought
A whirlwind which let fall a massy arm
From that strong plant
And both were struck dead by that sacred yew
In that base shallow grave that was their due

FLAMINEO
Excellent devil
She’s taught him in a dream
To make away his duchess and her husband

ZANCHE moans

ANGLE ON CORDELIA

Silently watching this scene of sex and conspiracy to murder
ANGLE ON BRACCIANO

Embracing VITTORIA who shivers

BRACCIANO
Sweetly shall I interpret this your dream
You are lodged within his arms who shall protect you
From all the fevers of a jealous husband
From the poor envy of our phlegmatic duchess
Ill seat you above law and above scandal
You shall to me at once
Be dukedom health wife children friends and all

Suddenly CORNELIA unable to be silent longer steps into
the light The fish swim off in all directions

CORNELIA
Woe to light hearts - they still forerun our fall

FLAMINEO
What fury raised thee up Away away

ZANCHE embarrassed retreats CORNELIA ignores her SON
glowers over BRACCIANO and her DAUGHTER

CORNELIA
What make you here my lord this dead of night

FLAMINEO
I pray will you go to bed then
Lest you be blasted

CORNELIA
O that this fair garden be a nursery
For witchcraft rather than a burial plot
For both your honours

BRACCIANO laughs They arent in a garden But VITTORIA
knows to whom CORNELIA refers

VITTORIA
Dearest mother hear me

CORNELIA
See the curse of children
In life they keep us frequently in tears
And in the cold grave leave us in pale fears

BRACCIANO
Come come I will not hear you

VITTORIA
(kisses him)
Dear my lord

CORNELIA
Where is thy duchess now adulterous duke
Thou little dreamst this night shes come to Rome

FLAMINEO steps into the circle of light

FLAMINEO
How Come to Rome

VITTORIA
The duchess -

BRACCIANO
She had been better -

CORNELIA is well pleased with VITTORIA’s and BRACCIANO’s panic

Only FLAMINEO keeps his cool

CORNELIA
The lives of princes should like dials move
Whose regular example is so strong
They make the times by them go right or wrong

FLAMINEO
So have you done

CORNELIA
(ignoring him)
Unfortunate Camillo

VITTORIA
I do protest if any chaste denial
If anything but blood could have allayed
His long suit to me -

CORNELIA
I will join with thee

To the most woeful end ever mother kneeled -
(she tries to pull VITTORIA to her knees)

If thou dishonour thus thy husbands bed

Be thy life short as are the funeral tears

In great mens

BRACCIANO hauls VITTORIA back kisses her roughly

BRACCIANO
Fie fie the womans mad

CORNELIA
Be thy act Judas-like - betray in kissing
Mayst thou be envied during his short breath
And pitied like a wretch after his death

VITTORIA
O me accursed

This is too much for VITTORIA who had not counted on her
MOTHER’s presence much less her curse She flees

FLAMINEO
Are you out of your wits My lord
Ill fetch her back again

BRACCIANO
No Ill to bed
Send Doctor Julio to me presently -
(to CORNELIA)
Uncharitable woman Thy rash tongue
Hath raised a fearful and prodigious storm
Be thou the cause of all ensuing harm

He exits FLAMINEO glares at his mother straightens his tie

FLAMINEO
Now you that stand so much upon your honour
I would fain know where lies the mass of wealth
Which you have hoarded for my maintenance

CORNELIA
What Because we are poor
Shall we be vicious

FLAMINEO
Pray what means have you
To keep me from the galleys or the gallows
My father proved himself a gentleman
Sold all his land and like a fortunate fellow
Died ere the money was spent
He grabs a popular magazine from a glassy surface
On the cover is DUKE BRACCIANO FLAMINEO is in the photo
half-obscured in sunglasses

FLAMINEO
You brought me up
At Padua I confess where I protest
For want of means - the University judge me -
I have been fain to heel my tutors stockings
I graduated then to this dukes service
(leafs through the MAGAZINE)
I visited the court whence I returned
More courteous more lecherous by far
But not a suit the richer

He scans the pages trying to find another picture of BRACCIANO

or even better of himself

FLAMINEO
And shall I
Having a path so open and so free
Retain your milk in my pale forehead
No this face of mine
Ill arm and fortify with lusty wine
Gainst shame and blushing

FLAMINEO attempts to show his MOTHER his picture CORNELIA
knocks it out of his hand

CORNELIA
O that I never had borne thee -

FLAMINEO
So would I
I would the commonest courtesan
Had been my mother rather than thyself
Nature is very pitiful to whores
To give them but few children yet those children
Plurality of fathers they are sure
They shall not want Go go
Complain unto my great lord cardinal

CORNELIA
O my heart
My son the pander Now I find our house
Sinking to ruin Earthquakes leave behind
Iron or lead or stone
But - woe to ruin - violent lust leaves none

She exits FLAMINEO alone for the first time addresses
the CAMERA

FLAMINEO
The duchess come to court I like not that

He picks up the magazine leafs through it again until
he finds a page which bears his VITTORIA’s and BRACCIANO’s
photographs He smooths the glossy paper

FLAMINEO
We are engaged to mischief and must on
As rivers to find out the ocean
Flow with crook bendings beneath forced banks
Or as we see to aspire some mountains top
The way ascends not straight but imitates
The subtle foldings of a winters snake
So who knows policy and her true aspect
Shall find her ways winding and indirect

He kisses his picture carefully puts the magazine back where
it was and leaves Sensing no one the lights dim in the
weird aquarium Only the glowing fighting fish remain

FRANCISCO DE MEDICIS STUDY INT DAY

- where all is business It is like Corleones office in THE
GODFATHER Venetian blinds cigarette smoke faces in shadow

DON FRANCISCO DE MEDICIS DUKE OF FLORENCE sits behind his
desk The petitioner is ISABELLA DE MEDICIS DE URSINI
his sister

FRANCISCO
Have you not seen your husband since you arrived

ISABELLA
Not yet sir

FRANCISCO
Surely he is wondrous kind
If I had such a dove-house as Camillos
I’d set fire on it were it but to destroy
The polecats that haunt it -
The study door flies open letting in light And in runs little
PRINCE GIOVANNI ISABELLA’s and BRACCIANOs sturdy spoiled son

GIOVANNI
Lord Uncle You did promise me a horse
And armour

FRANCISCO
That I did my pretty cousin
Marcello see it fitted

ANGLE ON MARCELLO

One of DON FRANCISCOs many attendants in the doorway An
honest-seeming sort He is FLAMINEO’s and VITTORIA’s brother

MARCELLO
My lord - the duke is here

FRANCISCO
(rising)
Sister away you must not yet be seen

ISABELLA
I do beseech you entreat him mildly

FRANCISCO
I wish I may

He kisses her ISABELLA slips out of a side door as MARCELLO
ushers in BRACCIANO and FLAMINEO

FRANCISCO
Void the chamber

ANGLE ON FLAMINEO

Bowing and scraping to the two DUKES as MARCELLO ushers him and
little GIOVANNI out again

CORRIDOR INT DAY

We follow FLAMINEO and MARCELLO out MARCELLO marches off with
little GIOVANNI FLAMINEO leans against the DUKE’s door and
listens -

FRANCISCO (0S)
(audible through the door)
I pray my lord
Be you my orator my hearts too full
Ill second you anon
FLAMINEO presses his ear against the door to hear the Cardinal -

MONTICELSO 0OS
Ere I begin
Let me entreat your grace forgo all passion
Which may be raised by my free discourse

STUDY INT DAY
FRANCISCO and MONTICELSO surround BRACCIANO in easy chairs

BRACCIANO
As silent as in church - you may proceed

Silence They all swirl the ice in their whiskey glasses

MONTICELSO
It is a wonder to your noble friends
That you should in your prime age
Neglect your throne for the soft down
Of an insatiate bed O my lord
The drunkard after all his lavish cups
Is dry and then is sober so at length
When you awake from this lascivious dream
Repentance then will follow like the sting
Placed in the adders tail

BRACCIANO
You have said my lord -

MONTICELSO
Enough to give you taste
How far I am from flattering your greatness

BRACCIANO snorts He sips his whiskey and turns back to
face DON FRANCISCO

BRACCIANO
Now you that are his second what say you
Do not like young hawks fetch a course about
Your game flies fair and for you

FRANCISCO
Do not fear it
Ill answer you in your own hawking phrase
Some eagles that should gaze upon the sun
Seldom soar high but take their lustful ease
Since they from dunghill birds their prey can seize
You know Vittoria -

BRACCIANO
Yes -

CRASH THE STUDY DOOR FLIES OPEN

FLAMINEO stumbles in The door on which he was leaning has
given way He bows to them all mimes an explanation bows
again goes out shuts the door

CORRIDOR INT DAY

Filling with PARTY GUESTS soaked by the rain FLAMINEO pushes
through them bowing to the odd PERSON OF IMPORTANCE Pushing
against the flow he heads -

OUTSIDE EXT DAY
The rain pours down The last wet GUESTS run in

FLAMINEO hurries along the side of the house He shelters
beneath DUKE FRANCISCO’s study window pretending to light
a cigarette

FRANCISCO 0S
You shift your shirt there
When you retire from tennis

BRACCIANO OS
Happily

MONTICELSO OS
She is your strumpet -

The CAMERA rises peers into the study where the THREE NOBLES
sit

BRACCIANO
Uncivil sir theres hemlock in thy breath
And that black slander Were she a whore of mine
All thy loud cannons thy galleys nor thy sworn
confederates
Durst not supplant her

FRANCISCO
Thou hast a wife our sister would I had given
Both her white hands to death when I gave thee
But one

BRACCIANO
Spit thy poison -

LIGHTNING Followed by THUNDER All three sip whiskey
FRANCISCO
I shall not need lust carries her sharp whip
At her own girdle Look to it for our anger
Is making thunderbolts

BRACCIANO
Thunder In faith
They are but crackers

OUTSIDE EXT DAY

LIGHTNING MORE THUNDER The RAIN drenches FLAMINEO
scrambling up the side of the house like a spider trying
to get a look through the window

STUDY INT DAY
FRANCISCO looks at BRACCIANO coldly

FRANCISCO
Well end this with the cannon

BRACCIANO
You’ll get naught by it but iron in your wounds
And gunpowder in your nostrils

Little GIOVANNI races in again riding a toy hourse
FLAMINEO peers through the transom

MONTICELSO

No more my lords Here comes a champion
Shall end the difference between you both
Your son the Prince Giovanni See my lords
What hopes you store in him

(he tweaks GIOVANNI’s cheek

GIOVANNI squirms)
Now is he apt for knowledge and for examples
Whom should he rather strive to imitate
Than his own father

(to BRACCIANO)
Be his pattern then
Leave him a stock of virtue that may last
Should fortune rend his sails and split his mast

BRACCIANO
Your hand boy Growing to a soldier

GIOVANNI
Give me a pike
FRANCISCO
What practising your pike so young fair coz

GIOVANNI
Might not a child of good discretion
Be leader to an army

FRANCISCO
Yes cousin a young prince
Of good discretion might

BRACCIANO
Forward lapwing

GIOVANNI
The first year uncle that I go to war
All prisoners that I take I will set free
Without their ransom

FRANCISCO
Ha without their ransom
How then will you reward your soldiers
That took those prisoners for you

GIOVANNI
Thus my lord
Ill marry them to all the wealthy widows
That fall that year

FRANCISCO
Why then the next year following
Youll have no men to go with you to war
GIOVANNI
Why then Ill press the women to the war
And then the men will follow

MONTICELSO
Witty prince

CRASH Outside the sound of something falling several
things being smashed
OUTSIDE EXT DAY

FLAMINEO has fallen from his perch broken a garbage frame
and overturned a dustbin

ANGLE ON SECURITY MEN in TUXEDOS

Running across the lawn
DON FRANCISCO’S STUDY INT DAY

FRANCISCO and BRACCIANO are on their knees beside the little
PRINCE Three generations of noble aristos

FRANCISCO
See a good habit makes a child a man
Whereas a bad one makes a man a beast
Come you and I are friends

He embraces BRACCIANO and the little PRINCE

BRACCIANO
Most wishedly
Like bones which broke in sunder and well set
Knit the more strongly

ISABELLA enters FRANCISCO rises

FRANCISCO
Behold your duchess
We now will leave you and expect from you
Nothing but kind entreaty

BRACCIANO
You have charmed me

FRANCISCO and MONTICELSO exit bearing GIOVANNI with them

BRACCIANO
You are in health we see

ISABELLA
And above health
To see my lord well -

BRACCIANO
So I wonder much
What amorous whirlwind hurried you here

ISABELLA
Devotion my lord

BRACCIANO
Devotion
Is your soul charged with any grievous sin

ISABELLA
Tis burdened with too many and I think
The oftener that we cast our reckonings up
Our sleep will be the sounder

The suggestion that they be honest with each other is too much
for BRACCIANO who - glaring at her - opens the study door

FLAMINEO is crouched there dripping with water listening
He bows to them both backs away BRACCIANO closes the door

CORRIDOR INT DAY

FLAMINEO tries to be less obvious about his eavedropping
He pulls out his cigarettes the soaked pack disintergrates

He pretends to tie his shoes They are white loafers with
no laces

BRACCIANO 0OS
(yelling)
Accursed be your corpulent brother and the priest
That sang our wedding mass and even my issue

ISABELLA 0OS
Oh too too far you have cursed

BRACCIANO 0OS
And this divorce shall be as truly kept
As if the judge had doomed it Fare you well

Suddenly the study door opens again ISABELLA emerges
FLAMINEO bows and scrapes before her She ignores him

BRACCIANO
Go go complain to the great Duke

ISABELLA
No my dear lord
Ill work peace between you I will make

Myself the author of your cursed vow

I have some cause to do it you have none

For the weal of both your dukedoms let the fault
Remain with my supposed jealousy

ISABELLA gathers herself together and heads into the -

PARTY INT DAY

- followed by BRACCIANO and FLAMINEO Rain pours down the
glass panels of a huge gazebo shimmering across the
effervescent scene FLAMINEO shivers

All the GUESTS are soaked but this has only contributed to
the party atmosphere They are taking off their shirts
accepting glasses of champagne and fresh white towels from

FRANCISCOs attentive STAFF
ANGLE ON FRANCISCO

He is not fooled He sees ISABELLA has been crying
He glowers at BRACCIANO

FRANCISCO
Sister - This is not well my lord - why sister -
Was your husband loud since we departed

ISABELLA
By my life sir no
I swear by that I do not care to lose
Are all these ruins of my former beauty
Laid out for a whores triumph

FRANCISCO
What Turned fury

ISABELLA

To dig that strumpets eyes out let her lie
Some twenty months a-dying to cut off
Her nose and lips pull out her rotten teeth
Preserve her flesh like mummia for trophies
Of my just anger Hell to my affliction
Is mere snow-water By your favour sir -
Brother draw near and my lord cardinal -

(to BRACCIANO)
Sir let me borrow of you but one kiss
Henceforth Ill never lie with you

ANGLE ON FLAMINEO

Trying to square this with what he has just overheard
He thought BRACCIANO was divorcing ISABELLA

FRANCISCO
How Never more lie with him

BRACCIANO
(faking surprise)
Never lie with me

ISABELLA
And this divorce shall be as truly kept
As if in thronged court a thousand ears
Had heard it and a thousand lawyers hands
Sealed to the separation

FRANCISCO
Now by my birth you are a foolish mad
And jealous woman
BRACCIANO
You see tis not my seeking

FRANCISCO
(ignoring him)
Keep your vow
And take your chamber

ISABELLA
No sir I will not stay a minute
(glaring at them both)
O that I were a man or that I had power
To execute my apprehended wishes
I would whip some with scorpions

CARDINAL MONTICELSO tries to intercept her extending his ring
But ISABELLA is out of there

MONTICELSO
Oh good madam

BRACCIANO
Twere best to let her have her humour
Some half days journey will bring down her stomach
And then shell turn in post

FRANCISCO
To see her come
To my lord for a dispensation
Of her rash vow will beget excellent laughter

He and MONTICELSO look at BRACCIANO No one laughs
MARCELLO appears bows to the DUKES

MARCELLO
Camillos come my lord

FRANCISCO
Wheres the commission

MARCELLO
Tis here

FRANCISCO
Give me the signet

CAMILLO enters FRANCISCO transacts some business with the
politician involving commission papers and a signet ring

FLAMINEO leads his boss BRACCIANO aside

FLAMINEO
My lord do you mark their whispering
Theyre sending him to Naples but Ill send
him to hell

Enter DR JULIO a white-suited black-hearted mafia medic
with his black bag

BRACCIANO
About the murder -

FLAMINEO
Heres -

BRACCIANO
Oh the doctor

FLAMINEO
A poor quack-salving knave my lord he will
shoot pills into a mans guts he will poison
a kiss and was once minded for his masterpiece
because Ireland breeds no poison to have
prepared a deadly vapour in a Spaniards
fart that should have killed all Dublin

BRACCIANO
Oh Saint Anthonys fire

DOCTOR
Your secretary is merry my lord

FLAMINEO
O thou cursed antipathy to nature - Let me
embrace thee toad and love thee O thou
abominable loathsome gargarism

BRACCIANO
No more - I must employ thee honest doctor
You must to Padua and by the way
Use some of your skill for us

DOCTOR
Sir I shall

BRACCIANO
But for Camillo

FLAMINEO
He dies this night by such a politic strain
Men shall suppose him by his own engine slain
But for your duchess death -

DOCTOR
Ill make her sure
BRACCIANO
Small mischiefs are by greater made secure

FLAMINEO
(embracing DR JULIO)
Remember this you slave when knaves come
to preferment they rise as gallows one
upon anothers shoulders

CELLAR COMPUTER LAB INT NIGHT

Flourscents flicker out of darkness Enter BRACCIANO and the
DOCTOR in white labcoats with pen protectors

BRACCIANO
Now sir I claim your promise tis dead midnight
The time prefixed to show me by your art
How the intended murder of Camillo
And our loathed duchess grow to action

The DOCTOR boots up his machines Monitors glow

DOCTOR
You’ve won me by your bounty to a deed
I do not often practise Pray sit down
Put on this nightcap sir

Hands BRACCIANO a pair of headphones BRACCIANO puts them on
DOCTOR
And now
Ill show you by my strong commanding art

The circumstance that breaks your duchess heart

ON THE SCREENS

BRACCIANO watches excitedly We cant hear the audio

PRIVATE CHAPEL INT NIGHT

- hand-held footage of the DOCTOR and CHRISTOPHERO disguised
as MONKS They draw the curtain to reveal a large PORTRAIT
OF BRACCIANO like a Saint with many candles below it

ANGLE ON THE DOCTOR AND CHRISTOPHERO

Putting on spectacles of glass which cover their eyes and
noses Then they burn perfumes before the picture and wash
the lips of the picture that done quenching the fire and
putting off their spectacles they depart laughing

ANGLE ON BRACCIANO

Fixated on the images as -

ISABELLA enters in her night-gown bedward She kneels down
as to prayers then draws the curtain of the picture does
three reverences to it and kisses it thrice

She faints and - when the rest rush in - will not suffer
them to come near the painting ISABELLA dies Sorrow
expressed in GIOVANNI She’s conveyed out solemnly

CELLAR INT NIGHT

BRACCIANO
Excellent then shes dead

DOCTOR
Shes poisoned
By the fumed picture Twas her custom nightly

Before she went to bed to go and visit

Your picture and to feed her eyes and lips

On the dead shadow Doctor Julio
(indicates himself)

Observing this infects it with an oil

And other poisoned stuff which presently

Did suffocate her spirits

The DOCTOR rewinds the tape so that BRACCIANO can see her
choke again Then he fires up another SCREEN

DOCTOR
Now turn another way
And view Camillos far more politic fate
Strike louder music from this charmed ground
To yield as fits the act a tragic sound

He activates his music software - drum machine eerie Hammond
organ sounds BRACCIANO puts the headphones back on

ON SCREEN
CCTV - CAMILLO’S AQUARIUM INT DAY
FLAMINEO MARCELLO CAMILLO and GIRLS enter

They are all drunk and dancing then CAMILLO announces he must
feed his fish MARCELLO and GIRLS go off to look for a ladder

FLAMINEO strips off his shirt invites CAMILLO up onto his
shoulders - CAMILLO accepts the bunk-up He stands on
FLAMINEO’s back starts feeding his hungry fish

ANGLE ON FLAMINEO

Tipping CAMILLO into the PIRHANA TANK

CAMILLO chokes and hammers on the glass Pretending to help
him FLAMINEO seizes CAMILLO’s legs and forces CAMILLO head-

first down into the tank - breaking his neck

The water turns blood-red as the pirhanas attack
FLAMINEO finds the fashion magazine studies his picture

ANGLE ON MARCELLO and CO

Returning with the ladder - too late

FLAMINEO calls for help MARCELLO laments -

Fast-forward - CARDINAL MONTICELSO arrives with ARMED GUARDS

Fast-forward - FLAMINEO and MARCELLO arrested

CELLAR INT NIGHT

BRACCIANO
‘Twas quaintly done
It seems Marcello and Flamineo
Are both committed

DOCTOR
Yes you saw them guarded

Above their heads HEAVY FOOTSTEPS and breaking windows

DOCTOR
And now they’re come with purpose to apprehend
Your mistress fair Vittoria we are now
Beneath her roof Twere fit we instantly
Make out by some back postern

BRACCIANO nods indicates a heavy iron door in the cellar wall
It has a big safe-type wheel on it BRACCIANO spins the wheel
The iron door swings open

BRACCIANO
Noble friend
You bind me ever to you this shall stand
As the firm seal annexed to my hand

It shall enforce a payment

DOCTOR
Sir I thank you

The door leads into a long tunnel BRACCIANO lets DR JULIO
go first
TUNNEL INT NIGHT

The DOCTOR heads down the tunnel The walls are concrete
covered in metal spikes

DOCTOR
Both flowers and weeds spring when the sun is warm
And great men do great good or else great harm
SLAM He looks back BRACCIANO has shut the door trapping
DR JULIO between two closed metal doors

Gloating watching CCTV from within the tunnel as the DOCTOR
is crushed

CARDINAL MONTICELSO’S TV STUDIOS EXT DAY

1930s wedding-cake facade surrounded by boxy factory buildings
and poisoned streams In the distance half-hidden by smog

is the hill covered in palaces and cathedrals

TV STUDIOS INT DAY

FRANCISCO and MONTICELSO meet on a catwalk above the hurly-
burly of the studio below

MONTICELSO

Sir you know we have naught but circumstances
To charge her with about her husbands death
Their approbation therefore to the proofs

Of her black lust shall make her infamous

I wonder if Bracciano will be here

FRANCISCO
Oh fie twere impudence too palpable

CRANE DOWN to the studio floor Enter the STUDIO AUDIENCE
This includes FLAMINEO and MARCELLO in handcuffs with POLICE
ESCORT ZANCHE appears also in handcuffed with a LAWYER

LAWYER
(studying his brief)
My lord duke and your sister have been very private

FLAMINEO
You are a dull ass tis threatened they have been
very public

LAWYER
If it can be proved they have but kissed one another -

FLAMINEO
What then

LAWYER
My lord cardinal will ferret them
For to sow kisses is to reap lechery
and I am sure a woman that will endure kissing
is half won

FLAMINEO
True her upper part by that rule if you will
win her neither part too you know what follows

The LAWYER doesn’t understand MARCELLO disgusted
elbows FLAMINEO in the ribs

The GUARDS force the PRISONERS to sit at the side of the
STUDIO AUDIENCE A giant cross is wheeled upstage

ZANCHE
(re FLAMINEO)
He doth put on this feigned garb of mirth
To gull suspicion

MARCELLO
Oh my unfortunate sister
I would my dagger-point had cleft her heart
When she first saw Bracciano You ‘tis said
Were made his engine and his stalking horse

To undo my sister

FLAMINEO
I am a kind of path
To her and mine own preferment

MARCELLO
Your ruin

FLAMINEO
Hum thou art a soldier
Followest the great Duke feedst his victories
What hast got
The wealth of captains a poor handful
Which in thy palm thou bearest as men hold water -
Seeking to grip it fast the frail reward
Steals through thy fingers

MARCELLO
Sir

FLAMINEO indicates the fabric of his own crumpled slept-in
expensive suit

FLAMINEO
Thou hast scarce maintenance

To keep thee in fresh chamois -

The giant cross on the stage lights up Music

she is still confident beautiful demure She wears a
Motorcycle Jacket over an evening gown

In the hosts chair in front of the huge glowing cross

He wears a lot of fake tan a scarlet velour suit a red
skull-cap and another big cross He welcomes -

On his right a young keen VATICAN LAWYER (no applause)

On his left VITTORIA COROMBONA (massive applause - she is
the audiences favourite) and DUKE FRANCISCO DE MEDICIS (some

applause mostly from MARCELLO POLICE and SOLDIERS)

STUDIO VOICE
Cinquo quattro tre duo uno -

As the music dies there is a bit of a scuffle behind the
cameras

FLOOR MANAGER
Forbear my lord here is no place assigned you -

BRACCIANO forces his way past the FLOOR MANAGER onto the stage

MONTICELSO
(displeased yet smiling)
This business by his Holiness is left
To our examination

BRACCIANO
May it thrive with you

He lays a rich gown under him and sits facing VITTORIA
FRANCISCO
(to the FLOOR MANAGER)

A chair there for his Lordship

BRACCIANO
Forbear your kindness

FLAMINEO and ZANCHE applaud And VITTORIA is clearly pleased

that her lover has come through for her in public

MONTICELCO
(not pleased)
At your pleasure sir
Now signior fall to your plea

The VATICAN LAWYER rises He clears his throat
VITTORIA
(to FRANCISCO charming and conversational)
Whats he
FRANCISCO
(equally charming)
A lawyer that pleads against you

MONTICESLO
Go on sir

The LAWYER clears his throat again
LAWYER
Please connive your judgments to the view
Of this debauched and diversivolent woman
Who such a black concatenation
Of mischief hath effected -

VITTORIA
Whats all this

LAWYER
Hold your peace
Exorbitant sins must have exulceration

BOOS from the AUDIENCE

VITTORIA
Pray my lord let him speak his usual tongue
Ill make no answer else

Laughter Spontaneous APPLAUSE

MONTICELSO snaps his fingers They go to a commercial break
The LAWYER is gone

MONTICELSO pops pills receives makeup and a massage
He looks like the devil -

STUDIO VOICE
5-4-3 -2-1-

- yet as the CAMERA returns to him he acquires the face
of an angel

MONTICELSO
I shall be plainer with you and paint out
Your follies in more natural red and white
Than that upon your cheek

CUT TO VITTORIA
She raises a hand to her cheek then laughs
VITTORIA
O you mistake
You raise a blood as noble in this cheek
As ever was your mothers
MONTICELSO
Observe this creature here

A woman of a most prodigious spirit -

VITTORIA

It doth not suit a reverend Cardinal
To play the lawyer thus -

MONTICELSO activates his planned attack - on screen behind
him appears footage of VITTORIA attending various gala events
with different CELEBRITIES

MONTICELSO
Who knows not how when night by night
Her gates were choked with coaches and her rooms
Outbraved the stars with several kind of lights
When she did counterfeit a princes court
In music banquets and most riotous surfeits
This whore forsooth was holy

VITTORIA
Ha Whore - whats that

MONTICELSO smiles Hes got her attention As he speaks

the montage on the TV MONITORS shows abandoned street children
drug addicts executions graveyards autopsies intercut

with shots of VITTORIA partying and laughing -

MONTICELSO
Shall I expound whore to you sure I shall
Ill give their perfect character They are first
Sweetmeats which rot the eater in mans nostrils
Poisoned perfumes They are cozening alchemy
Shipwrecks in calmest weather

- and VITTORIA the previous evening arrested marched out
of her home with only a biker jacket over her shoulders

MONTICELSO
What are whores
Cold Russian winters that appear so barren
As if that nature had forgot the spring
They are the true material fire of hell
ANGLE ON BRACCIANO
Making eyes at VITTORIA She does not look at him

VITTORIA
This character escapes me

VITTORIA
Oh hes a happy husband
Now he owes nature nothing

The TECHNICIANS cue in GRAPHICS
Behind MONTICELSO and FRANCISCO appear computer-generated
simulations questioning the mysterious death of CAMILLO

FRANCISCO
What a prodigy it was
That from some two yards height a slender man
Should break his neck

MONTICELSO
In a fish tank

CUT BACK TO -

TV STUDIO INT DAY

FRANCISCO is on his feet and on the attack VITTORIA is
hemmed in between him and MONTICELSO on his extra-high dais
lit by saintly light his eyes are closed and he appears to
be praying

FRANCISCO
And whats more
Upon the instant lose all use of speech
All vital motion Now mark each circumstance

MONTICELSO
And look upon this creature was his wife
She comes not like a widow she comes armed
With scorn and impudence Is this a mourning-habit

MONTICELSO indicates the motorcycle jacket But VITTORIA
stays cool

VITTORIA
Had I foreknown his death as you suggest
I would have bespoke my mourning

ZANCHE cheers Scattered APPLAUSE from the AUDIENCE

MONTICELSO
Oh you are cunning

VITTORIA

You shame your wit and judgment
To call it so

(to the STUDIO AUDIENCE)
These are but feigned shadows of my evils

(to her ACCUSERS)
Terrify babes my lord with painted devils
For your names
Of whore and murdress they proceed from you
As if a man should spit against the wind
The filth returns ins face

FLAMINEO applauds his sister rattling his chains
More APPLAUSE from the AUDIENCE

MONTICELSO
Pray you mistress satisfy me one question
Who lodged beneath your roof that fatal night
Your husband broke his neck

BRACCIANO
That question
Enforceth me break silence I was there

ALL THE CAMERAS ZOOM IN ON BRACCIANO

Seated on his Elvis cloak He rises He wears shades
BRACCIANO thinks himself pretty cool and very important

MONTICELSO
Your business

BRACCIANO
Why I came to comfort her
And take some course for settling her estate
Because I heard her husband was in debt
To you my lord

ALL CAMERAS ZOOM ON MONTICELSO
Who back-footed tells the truth

MONTICELSO
He was

BRACCIANO
And it was strangely feared

That you would cozen her

MONTICELSO
Who made you overseer

BRACCIANO
Why my charity my charity which should flow
From every generous and noble spirit
To orphans and to widows

BRACCIANO strides across the stage stands protectively
over VITTORIA Murmurs from the AUDIENCE Applause

MONTICELSO

FRANCISCO signals another commercial break MUSIC plays
BRACCIANO
Cowardly dogs bark loudest sirrah priest

All the cameras turn to MONTICELSO fresh from another
powdering-down He smiles angelic again

MONTICELSO
Your champions gone

VITTORIA
The wolf may prey the better

The show goes live again The AUDIENCE has been removed
FRANCISCO relaxed in his chair discusses CAMILLOs death

FRANCISCO
My lord theres great suspicion of the murder
But no sound proof who did it For my part
I do not think she hath a soul so black
(indicates VITTORIA)
To act a deed so bloody

VITTORIA
I discern poison under your gilded pills

A HOSTESS hands the CARDINAL an envelope
He opens it reads

MONTICELSO
Now your dukes gone I will produce a letter
Wherein twas plotted he and you should meet -

He waves a piece of paper at the CAMERAS

MONTICELSO
Where after wanton bathing and the heat
Of a lascivious banquet I pray read it

I shame to speak the rest

He hands the paper to FRANCISCO who shakes his head
ANGLE ON FLAMINEO ZANCHE AND MARCELLO

And their GUARDS Alone in the auditorium

VITTORIA
Grant I was tempted
Temptation to lust proves not the act
You read his hot love to me but you want
My frosty answer

MONTICELSO
Frost in the dog-days Strange

VITTORIA
Condemn you me for that a duke did love me
So may you blame some fair and crystal river
For that some melancholic distracted man
Hath drowned himself in it

MONTICELSO
Truly drowned indeed

VITTORIA
Sum up my faults I pray and you shall find
That beauty and gay clothes a merry heart
And a good stomach to feast are all
All the poor crimes that you can charge me with

MONTICELSO
If the devil
Did ever take good shape behold his picture

VITTORIA
You have one virtue left
You will not flatter me

gravely

RECORDED FANFARE

MONTICELSO
Heres your sentence you are confined
Unto a house of convertites with your bawd -

Erect it for their wives that I am sent
To lodge there

MONTICELSO

He indicates ZANCHE

MONTICELSO
You gentlemen Flamineo and Marcello
The court hath nothing now to charge you with
Only you must remain upon your sureties
For your appearance

FRANCISCO

FLAMINEO

And my lord duke for me
TWO POLICEMEN grab VITTORIA

VITTORIA

HOUSE OF CONVERTITES EXT DAY

At the gate the MATRON interviews BRACCIANO and FLAMINEO
ZANCHE in a nun’s habit attends her

MATRONA
Should it be known the duke hath such recourse
To your imprisoned sister I were like
To incur much damage by it

FLAMINEO
Not a scruple
The Pope lies on his death-bed and their heads
Are troubled now with other business
Than guarding of a lady

The MATRON produces the keys to the inner cloisters
A MOTORCYCLE MESSENGER cruises up dusty from the highway

MESSENGER
Matrona let me speak with you
I would entreat you to deliver for me
(stage whisper eyeing FLAMINEO)
This letter to the fair Vittoria

MATRON
(signing for the letter)

I shall sir

FLAMINEO studies the note He reads aloud

FLAMINEO
Your tears Ill turn to triumphs be but mine
Wine my lord would better serve his turn
(increasingly mocking)
Your sad imprisonment Ill soon uncharm
And with a princely uncontrolled arm
Lead you to Florence where my love and care
Shall hang your wishes in my silver hair
A halter on his strange equivocation

BRACCIANO
Gods death I11 cut her into atomies
And let the irregular north-wind sweep her up
And blow her into his nostrils
(shouting at ZANCHE)
Wheres this whore

ZANCHE
That - What do you call her

BRACCIANO
Oh I could be mad
Prevent the cursd disease shell bring me to
And tear my hair off Wheres this changeable stuff

FLAMINEO the intelligencer knows the letter is a fake
Hes shocked that his employer is so quickly tricked by it

FLAMINEO
Oer head and ears in water I assure you
She is not for your wearing

BRACCIANO attempts to march FLAMINEO into the convent

BRACCIANO
In you pander
FLAMINEO
What me my lord Am I your dog

BRACCIANO
A bloodhound Do you brave

BRACCIANO tries to push FLAMINEO inside But FLAMINEO has
had enough

BRACCIANO
Would you be kicked

FLAMINEO
Would you have your neck broke

BRACCIANO understands the reference to CAMILLO Not only
is he astonished that his secretary is standing up to him
he is also afraid So he puffs out his chest -

BRACCIANO
Do you know me

FLAMINEO
Oh my lord methodically
As in this world there are degrees of evils
So in this world there are degrees of devils
Youre a great duke I your poor secretary

BRACCIANO
Pander ply your convoy and leave your prating

FLAMINEO
All your kindness to me is like that miserable
courtesy of the Cyclops to Ulysses - you reserve
me to be devoured last

VITTORIA is blamelessly seated among the other NUNS

She wears a WHITE HABIT All are watching the MONTICELSO’S
TV CHANNEL for news of the new POPE BRACCIANO thrusts the
letter at VITTORIA

BRACCIANO
Can you read mistress Look upon that letter
There are no characters nor hieroglyphics
You need no comment I am grown your receiver -

Gods precious you shall be a brave great lady
A stately and advanced whore

The NUNS stare at him VICTORIA considers her reply

VITTORIA

BRACCIANO

VITTORIA’S CELL INT DAY

BRACCIANO rages about VITTORIA’s cell She has no cabinet
no treasury of love-letters Nor anything else

VITTORIA
Sir upon my soul
I have not any
(she studies the letter)
Whence was this directed

BRACCIANO is confused He doesn’t know
FLAMINEO enters the tiny room ZANCHE hovers at the door

FLAMINEO
Ware hawk my lord

VITTORIA
(reading)
Florence this is some treacherous plot my lord -

BRACCIANO

Right They are plots
Your beauty 0 ten thousand curses on it
How long have I beheld the devil in crystal
Thou hast led me like an heathen sacrifice
With music and with fatal yokes of flowers
To my eternal ruin

(he starts crying out of

pity for himself)
Woman to man is either a god or a wolf

VITTORIA
My lord -

BRACCIANO

Away
Well be as differing as two adamants
The one shall shun the other What Dost weep

FLAMINEO sees his sister is crying But she makes no sound

FLAMINEO
Fie my lord

BRACCIANO
Oh my sweetest duchess
How lovely art thou now I was bewitched
(to VITTORIA)
For all the world speaks ill of thee

VITTORIA eyes BRACCIANO with contempt

VITTORIA
No matter
Ill live so now Ill make that world recant
And change her speeches You did name your duchess

BRACCIANO
Whose death God pardon

VITTORIA
Whose death God revenge
On thee most gutless duke

FLAMINEO
Now for two whirlwinds

VITTORIA
What have I gained by thee but infamy
You’ve stained the spotless honour of my house
And frighted thence noble society
What do you call this house
Is this your palace Did not the judge style it
A house of penitent whores Who sent me to it
To this incontinent college Is it not you
Is this your high preferment Go go brag
How many ladies you have undone like me

ANGLE ON BRACCIANO

His false tears have dried up He turns to FLAMINEO
who blanks him VITTORIA faces the wall

BRACCIANO
I have drunk Lethe Vittoria
My dearest happiness Vittoria
What do you ail my love Why do you weep
Are not those matchless eyes mine

VICTORIA doesn’t answer Wearily FLAMINEO tries to
help his master

FLAMINEO
Turn to my lord good sister

VITTORIA
Hence you pander

FLAMINEO
Pander Am I the author of your sin

VITTORIA
Yes hes a base thief that a thief lets in

FLAMINEO
Were blown up my lord -

BRACCIANO sweeps his cape aside and goes down on one
knee before VITTORIA

BRACCIANO
Will you hear me

VITTORIA
Never

She stalks out of the room BRACCIANO stares helplessly
after her FLAMINEO pulls BRACCIANO to his feet -

FLAMINEO
Come come you have wronged her
What a strange credulous man were you my lord

CLOISTERS INT DAY

Excitement all around On the VATICAN TV white smoke
appears and fanfares are heard

TV ANNOUNCER
(on screen)
The lord cardinals
Are busied ‘bout electing of the Pope
They’ve given over scrutiny and are fallen
To admiration
BRACCIANO pursues VITTORIA on his knees again
He threatens unconvincingly to pull his eyes out

BRACCIANO
Shall these eyes
Which have so long time dwelt upon your face
Be now put out

FLAMINEO
Hand her my lord and kiss her

BRACCIANO
Let us renew right hands

He attempts to hold VITTORIAs hand See’s he’s still
wearing his wedding ring - hastily pulls it off

VITTORIA
Hence

BRACCIANO
Never shall rage or the forgetful wine
Make me commit like fault
Be thou at peace with me

FLAMINEO
(to VITTORIA)
Mark his penitence
Best natures do commit the grossest faults
When theyre given over to jealousy as best wine
Dying makes strongest vinegar

VITTORIA
O ye dissembling men

FLAMINEO
We sucked that sister
From womens breasts in our first infancy

VITTORIA
To add misery to misery

BRACCIANO
Sweetest

VITTORIA
Am I not low enough
Ay ay your good heart gathers like a snowball
Now your affections cold

FLAMINEO
Uds foot it shall melt
To a heart again

VITTORIA
Your dog or hawk should be rewarded better
Than I have been I11l speak not one word more

VITTORIA sits down beneath a carved skull and crossbones
at the end of the cloister She wraps her arms around her
knees closes her eyes

FLAMINEO
Stop her mouth
With a sweet kiss my lord

BRACCIANO tries to hug and kiss VITTORIA She ignores him
FLAMINEO presses on with his optimistic commentary regardless

FLAMINEO
So now the tides turned the vessels come about
Hes a sweet armful

BRACCIANO
That you should chide thus

He punches VITTORIAs arm Still she ignores him

FLAMINEO
My lord supply your promises with deeds
You know that painted meat no hunger feeds

BRACCIANO tries to embrace her -
VITTORIA scratches his face She tears off down the cloister
past the TV where DON FRANCISCO is being interviewed

FRANCISCO
(on screen)
I’1ll lay a thousand ducats you hear news
Of a Pope presently - hark sure he’s elected -

BRACCIANO
Soft the same project which the Duke of Florence
(Whether in love or gullery I know not)
Laid down for her escape will I pursue

FLAMINEO
And no time fitter than this night my lord
The Pope being dead and all the cardinals entered
The conclave for electing a new Pope
The city in a great confusion
We may lay her post-horse and away for Padua

BRACCIANO indicates the exhausted VITTORIA surrounded by
CONVERTITES all giving him the evil eye

BRACCIANO

Ill instantly steal forth the Prince Giovanni
And make for Padua You two with your old mother
And young Marcello that attends on Florence
If you can work him to it follow me
I will advance you all

(calls to VITTORIA but

dares not approach her)
For you Vittoria think of a duchess title

FLAMINEO gives VITTORIA the thumbs-up

FLAMINEO
Lo you sister
(grabs BRACCIANOs arm)
Stay my lord Ill tell you a tale

CARTOON MUSIC is heard BRACCIANO stares at FLAMINEO
strangely entranced There follows a -

CARTOON SEQUENCE - NARRATED BY FLAMINEO
Depicting a fierce cartoon crocodile and a cute little bird

FLAMINEO VO
The crocodile which lives in the River Nilus
hath a worm breeds in the teeth of it which puts
him to extreme anguish a little bird no bigger
than a wren is barber-surgeon to this crocodile
flies into the jaws of it picks out the worm
and brings present remedy The fish glad of ease
but ungrateful to her that did it closeth his chaps
intending to swallow her But nature loathing
such ingratitude hath armed this bird with a
quill or prick on the head which wounds the
crocodile in the mouth forceth him open his
bloody prison and away flies the pretty
tooth-picker from her cruel patient

The CARTOON ends BRACCIANO and FLAMINEO are left lolling
into space BRACCIANO is entertained excited but uneasy

BRACCIANO
Your application is I have not rewarded
The service you have done me

FLAMINEO
No my lord
My sister is the crocodile shes blemished in her
fame my lord cures it and though the comparison
hold not in every particle yet observe remember
what good the bird with the prick in the head hath
done you and scorn ingratitude

He sighs And turns to the CAMERA

FLAMINEO
It may appear to some ridiculous
Thus to talk knave and madman and sometimes
Come in with a dried sentence stuffed with sage
But this allows my varying of shapes
Knaves do grow great by being great mens apes

DE MEDICIS SCREENING ROOM INT DAY

DON FRANCISCO watches live TV from St Peter’s Square
Expressionless sipping his martini

ST PETER’S SQUARE EXT DAY

Clad all in WHITE the NEW POPE - MONTIECELSO - addresses a huge
THRONG

MONTICELSO
- Now though this be the first day of our seat
We cannot better please the divine power
Than to sequester from the holy church
These cursed persons Make it therefore known
We do denounce excommunication
Against them both all that are theirs in Rome
We likewise banish

outdone wears a white leather jumpsuit Among the guests are
FLAMINEO MARCELLO CORNELIA and ZANCHE ZANCHE is clearly
fascinated by another guest a man in LONG WHITE ARAB DRESS

- MULINASSAR - attended by two SERVANTS in priests’ robes

FLAMINEO
In all the weary minutes of my life
Day neer broke up till now This marriage
Confirms me happy

MARCELLO
Tis a good assurance
Saw you not yet the Moor thats come to court

FLAMINEO
Yes and conferred with him in my dukes closet
I have not seen a goodlier personage
Nor ever talked with man better experienced
In state affairs or rudiments of war

MARCELLO
Is the Moor a Christian

FLAMINEO
He is

MARCELLO
Why proffers he his service to your duke

FLAMINEO turns his head slowly towards his BROTHER
Even drunk he knows MARCELLO is on a fishing expedition

FLAMINEO
Because he understands theres like to grow
Some wars between us and your Duke of Florence
In which he hopes employment

MARCELLO nods Hes drunk and knows this too

FLAMINEO
I never saw one in a stern bold look
Wear more command He talks
As if hed travelled all the princes courts
Of Christendom in all things strives to express how
Glories like glow-worms afar off shine bright
But looked to near have neither heat nor light
The duke -

BRACCIANO very drunk welcomes - for the fourth or fifth
time - his guest MULINASSSAR MULINASSARs face is almost
entirely hidden by his white headdress thick black beard
and Wayfarers

BRACCIANO
You are nobly welcome We have heard at full
Your honourable service against the Turk
To you brave Mulinassar we assign
A competent pension

Applause from the COURTIERS MULINASSAR answers bowing
with a mumbling thick accent He is FRANCISCO DE MEDICIS
in disguise

BRACCIANO presses on visiting his many other GUESTS
ANGLE ON FRANCISCO

Watching him go FLAMINEO MARCELLO and ZANCHE sit at his
table

MARCELLO
Why doth this devil haunt you say

FLAMINEO
‘Tis not so great a cunning as men think
To raise the devil for heres one up already
The greatest cunning were to lay him down -

FLAMINEO and ZANCHE laugh and kiss MARCELLO is drunk and
pissed off by BRACCIANOs celebrations He too simple a
courtier to recognise his own Duke FRANCISCO in disguise

MARCELLO
She is your shame

FLAMINEO
I pray thee pardon her
In faith you see women are like to burs
Where their affection throws them there theyll stick

ZANCHE
(eyeing FRANCISCO)
That is my countryman a goodly person
When hes at leisure Ill discourse with him
In our own language

But FLAMINEO buttonholes “MULINASSAR” first -

FLAMINEO
How is it brave soldier oO that I had seen
Some of your iron days I pray relate

Some of your service to us

FRANCISCO
‘Tis a ridiculous thing for a man to be his
own chronicle
MARCELLO
Youre too stoical The duke will expect
other discourse from you

FRANCISCO
I shall never flatter him I have studied man
too much to do that what difference is between
the duke and I No more than between two bricks
all made of one clay Only one is placed on top
of a turret the other in the bottom of a well

MARCELLO
(intervening drunkenly)
I have been a soldier too

FRANCISCO
How have you thrived

MARCELLO
Faith poorly

FRANCISCO
Thats the misery of peace

FLAMINEO
Give me a fair room yet hung with arras and
some great cardinal to lug me by the ears
as his endeared minion

They laugh but FLAMINEO really means this It is his golden
dream

FRANCISCO
And you may do the devil knows what villainy

FLAMINEO
And safely

FRANCISCO

Staring at ZANCHE

MARCELLO
Look you yonders your sweet mistress

FLAMINEO
Thou art my sworn brother - Ill tell thee
I do love that Moor that witch very
constrainedly she knows some of my villainy
I do love her just as a man holds a wolf by
the ears But for fear of her turning upon
me and pulling out my throat I would let
her go to the devil

MARCELLO
I hear she claims marriage of thee

FLAMINEO
Faith I made to her some such dark promise -

ZANCHE

Catch cold anights

MARCELLO
Youre a strumpet an impudent one

He kicks ZANCHE She kicks him back FLAMINEO separates them

FLAMINEO
Why do you kick her Say

MARCELLO
She brags that you shall marry her

FLAMINEO
What then

MARCELLO
I had rather she were pitched upon a stake
In some new-seeded garden to affright
Her fellow crows thence

FLAMINEO
Youre a boy a fool
Be guardian to your hound I am of age

MARCELLO
If I take her near you Ill cut her throat

FLAMINEO
With a fan of feathers

MARCELLO
And for you - Ill whip
This folly from you

They fight FLAMINEO the older brother gets MARCELLO on
the ground gives him a couple of kicks

ZANCHE
Oh your brother

FLAMINEO
Hang him
I do suspect my mother played foul play
When she conceived thee

MARCELLO
Those words Ill make thee answer

With thy heart blood

MARCELLO pulls his knife - but FLAMINEO is ready for him
He grabs MARCELLOs arm twists it seizes the BLADE

FLAMINEO
Do you wrong me most that ought to offend me least
You know where you shall find me

MARCELLO
Very good

ALL SPLIT in different directions

GARDEN EXT DAY

In an idyllic garden in the grounds of BRACCIANOs estate
CORNELIA confronts MARCELLO

CORNELIA
I hear a whispering you are to fight
Who is your opposite What is the quarrel

MARCELLO
Tis an idle rumour

CORNELIA
Will you dissemble Sure you do not well
To fright me thus you never look thus pale
But when you are most angry

Suddenly we see this charming scene from the POV of
someone spying on MOTHER and SON a murderer lying-in-wait

MARCELLO
‘Tis not so
Was not this crucifix my fathers

CORNELIA
Yes

MARCELLO
I have heard you say giving my brother suck
He took the crucifix between his hands
And broke a limb off

CORNELIA
Yes but ‘tis mended

FLAMINEO
I have brought your weapon back

Before MARCELLO can turn FLAMINEO steps out of the bushes
runs him through with his own SWITCHBLADE

CORNELIA
Ha O my horror

MARCELLO
You have brought it home indeed

CORNELIA
Help 0 hes murdered

FLAMINEO
Ill to sanctuary
And send a surgeon to you

He runs off MULINASSAR’s “priestly” GUARDS appear

MARCELLO
Oh mother now remember what I told
Of breaking of the crucifix - farewell -

He dies JUMP CUT -

BRACCIANO in his flourescent racing outfit attended
by FLAMINEO arrives on the scene

CORNELIA
Oh my perpetual sorrow

BRACCIANO
Was this your handiwork

FLAMINEO
It was my misfortune

CORNELIA
He lies he lies He did not kill him

BRACCIANO
Have comfort my grieved mother

CORNELIA
Let me go let me go

She runs at FLAMINEO with the KNIFE drawn but coming
to him lets it fall

CORNELIA
The God of heaven forgive thee
I have scarce breath to number twenty minutes
Id not spend that in cursing Fare thee well
Half of thyself lies there

BRACCIANO
Mother pray tell me
How came he by his death What was the quarrel

CORNELIA
Indeed my younger boy presumed too much
Upon his manhood gave him bitter words
Drew his sword first and so I know not how
For I was out of my wits he fell withs head
Just in my bosom

ANGLE ON A PAGE

Astonished that CORDELIA like ISABELLA is lying to protect
a MURDERER

PAGE
That is not true madam

CORNELIA
I pray thee peace
One arrows grazed already
(embraces FLAMINEO)
It were vain
To lose this for that will never be found again

ANGLE ON MULINASSAR’S TWO SERVANTS

In the bushes dropping their priestly robes Beneath
they wear paramedics’ uniforms One of them sprays the
inside of a CRASH HELMET with poison

BRACCIANO
Go bear the body to Cornelias lodging
And we command that none acquaint our duchess
With this sad accident For you Flamineo
Hark you I will not grant your pardon

FLAMINEO

BRACCIANO
Only a lease of your life And that shall last
But for one day Thou shalt be forced each evening
To renew it or be hanged

FLAMINEO
(bowing low)
At your pleasure
Your will is law now I11l not meddle with it

BRACCIANO

(to FLAMINEO)

Thrilling RACING FOOTAGE

Then BRACCIANO loses control screeches off the track into
a barrier A wheel goes spinning BRACCIANOS PEOPLE

BRACCIANO

Gods death tear off my helmet

FLAMINEO

The PARAMEDICS in their helmets and uniforms shoulder him
roughly aside

FLAMINEO
A plague upon you

BRACCIANO
O I am gone already the infection
Flies to the brain and heart O thou strong heart
Theres such a covenant between the world and it
Theyre loath to break

GIOVANNI in a tiny racing outfit exactly like his DADs

GIOVANNI

BRACCIANO
Remove the boy away
Wheres this good woman Had I infinite worlds
They were too little for thee must I leave thee

And wretched murderers have I not power
To lengthen mine own a twelvemonth

(to VITTORIA)

This unctions sent from the great Duke of Florence

FRANCISCO
Sir be of comfort

BRACCIANO
O thou soft natural death that art joint-twin
To sweetest slumber The dull owl

Bears not against thy casement the hoarse wolf
Scents not thy carrion pity winds thy corpse
Whilst horror waits on princes

VITTORIA
I am lost for ever

BRACCIANO
How miserable a thing it is to die
Mongst women howling

But VITTORIA is not howling She stands alone and silent
in the expanding throng

AN AMBULANCE PULLS UP
The DRIVER opens the AMBULANCE DOORS
The PARAMEIDCS walk BRACCIANO towards their vehicle
BRACCIANO
On pain of death let no man name death to me
It is a word infinitely terrible
ANGLE ON FLAMINEO AND FRANCISCO
At the edge of the crowd as a TV CREW with lights arrives
FLAMINEO
To see what solitariness is about dying princes
As heretofore they have unpeopled towns divorced
friends and made great houses unhospitable so now

O justice where are their flatterers now

FRANCISCO
Come you have thrived well under him

FLAMINEO
Faith like a wolf in a womans breast I have
been fed with poultry but for money understand me
I had as good a will to cozen him as any officer
but I had not cunning enough to do it

FRANCISCO
Oh speak well of the duke

FLAMINEO
I have done

REPORTERS pursue BRACCIANO into the AMBULANCE

Yonders a fine slave come in now

FLAMINEO

BRACCIANO

BRACCIANO

BRACCIANO
Nothing Rare Nothing There is nothing -
Ill not be used thus

VITTORIA

BRACCIANO

More PHOTOGRAPHERS arrive CAMERAS and MICROPHONES are
thrust at FLAMINEO his spokesman

FLAMINEO

That makes her look as if she had sinned in the pastry

BRACCIANO seems near his end The PARAMEDICS strap him
onto a gurney

BRACCIANO

From all foul vermin Wheres Flamineo

ANGLE ON THE CROWD
All the PHOTOGRAPHERS and COURTIERS stare at FLAMINEO

FLAMINEO

I do not like that he names me so often
Especially on his death-bed tis a sign
I shall not live long

See hes near his end

PARAMEDIC

LODOVICO
Devil Bracciano thou art damned

GASPARO
Perpetually

LODOVICO
Now thou shalt die like a poor rogue

GASPARO
And stink
Like a dead fly-blown dog

LODOVICO
And be forgotten
Before the funeral sermon

Suddenly BRACCIANO who has seemed near death sits bolt
upright snapping his bonds

BRACCIANO
Vittoria Vittoria

LODOVICO
Oh the cursed devil -

GASPARO
Strangle him in private -

The doors fly open VITTORIA and ATTENDANTS try to enter
GASPARO pushes them back as LODOVICO throws a noose round

Sent from the Duke of Florence

AMBULANCE EXT DAY
VITTORIA FLAMINEO and all the COURTIERS struggle to peer

VITTORIA
O me this place is hell

FRANCISCO
(taking her picture with his phone-cam)
How heavily she takes it

FLAMINEO

(glad that the PAPERAZZI have

his SISTER in their sights)
Oh yes yes
Had women navigable rivers in their eyes
They would dispend them all I1l tell thee
These are but Moorish shades of griefs or fears
Theres nothing sooner dry than womens tears
FRANCISCO
Sure this was Florence doing

FLAMINEO
Very likely
Those are found weighty strokes which come from the hand
But those are killing strokes which come from the head
O the rare tricks of a Machivillian

A FUNERAL CORTEGE has begun VITTORIA walks solemnly head
bowed behind the slow-moving AMBULANCE She is followed by
all the other COURTIERS the PRESS and the POLICE in a long
slow circuit of the MOTODROME

ANGLE ON GASPARO

Driving the AMBULANCE

ANGLE ON FRANCISCOMULINASSAR

Walking in the CORTEGE ZANCHE falls into step beside him

FRANCISCO
Youre passionately met in this sad world

ZANCHE
Let those weep
That guiltily partake in the sad cause
I knew last night by a sad dream I had
Some mischief would ensue yet to say truth
My dream most concerned you

CuT TO -

ZANCHE’S DREAM TENT INT NIGHT

Within which ZANCHE and MULINASSAR are surrounded by pillows
rich fabrics and mosquito nets

ZANCHE VO
Methought sir you came stealing to my bed

FRANCISCO VO
Wilt thou believe me sweeting by this light
I was a-dreamt on thee too for methought
I saw thee naked

ZANCHE VO

Fie sir as I told you
Methought you lay down by me

FRANCISCO VO
So dreamt I
And lest thou shouldst take cold I covered thee
With this mantle Thou didst laugh
Exceedingly methought

ZANCHE VO
Laugh

FRANCISCO VO
And criedst out the hair did tickle thee

ZANCHE VO
There was a dream indeed

FRANCISCO embraces ZANCHE Within the dream they speak

FRANCISCO
You did tell me you would reveal a secret

ZANCHE

The Duke Francisco’s sister was poisoned
By a fumed picture and Camillos neck
Was broke by damned Flamineo

from SEMANA SANTA - passes them by

FRANCISCO
(finally)
Most strange

ZANCHE
Most true

FRANCISCO
Thou kept their counsel

ZANCHE
Sadly I confess -
For which urged with contrition I intend
This night to rob Vittoria
In coin and jewels
I shall at least make good unto your use
An hundred thousand crowns

FRANCISCO
Oh noble wench

ZANCHE
It is a dowry
Methinks should make that sun-burnt proverb false
And wash the Ethiop white

FRANCISCO
It shall away

ZANCHE
Be ready for our flight

FRANCISCO
An hour before day

ZANCHE takes off

BRACCIANOS MANSION INT DAY

BRACCIANOs sitting room - filled with gangster art and
stripey furniture AL CAPONE’s car Braces of DUELLING
PISTOLS mounted on the walls

FLAMINEO and GASPARO are both drunk and exhausted They
are supposed to be guarding the orphan GIOVANNI playing
with his computer game beneath a sliced-in-half-shark

GASPARO
(burps )
The young duke did you ever see a sweeter prince

FLAMINEO
I have known a poor womans bastard better favoured
This is behind him now to his face all comparisons
were hateful -
(realises GIOVANNI is listening)
- My gracious lord

GIOVANNI
I pray leave me sir

FLAMINEO
Your grace must be merry tis I have cause to mourn
for what said the little boy that rode behind his
father on horseback

GIOVANNI stares at FLAMINEO He cant believe this

Hes only ten his father is dead he hates this creep to
begin with and yet the idiot just wont leave him alone

GIOVANNI
Why what said he

FLAMINEO
When you are dead father said he I hope that I
shall ride in the saddle Oh ‘tis a brave thing
for a man to sit by himself He may stretch himself
in the stirrups look about and see the whole compass
of the hemisphere Youre now my lord in the saddle

GIOVANNI
Study your prayers sir and be penitent

He leaves GASPARO quickly follows him

FLAMINEO considers the mess he has just created and how
badly it is likely to turn out

FLAMINEO

Study my prayers He threatens me divinely
I am falling to pieces already I care not
though I were pounded to death in a mortar
to make a cullis for the devil
He hath his uncles villainous look

(GASPARO returns)
Now sir what are you

GASPARO surveys FLAMINEO coldly His manner has changed

GASPARO
It is the pleasure sir of the young duke
That you forbear the presence and all rooms
That owe him reverence

FLAMINEO
So the wolf and the raven are very pretty fools
when they are young Is it your office sir
to keep me out

GASPARO
So the duke wills

FLAMINEO
Verily Master Courtier say that a gentlewoman
were taken out of her bed about midnight and
committed to the tower yonder with nothing
about her but her smock would it not show a cruel
part in the gentleman-porter to lay claim to her
upper garment pull it over her head and ears
and put her in naked
GASPARO
Very good you are merry

He directs FLAMINEO toward the door

FLAMINEO
Doth he make a court-ejectment of me A flaming
fire-brand casts more smoke without a chimney
than within it Ill smoor some of them

FRANCISCO still disguised as MULINASSAR appears his
priestly ATTENDANTS carrying his suticases

FLAMINEO
How now Thou art sad

FRANCISCO
I met even now with the most piteous sight

FLAMINEO
Thou meetest another here a pitiful
Degraded courtier

But FRANCISCO though in disguise isnt joking

FRANCISCO
Your reverend mother
Is grown a very old woman in two hours
I found her winding of Marcellos corse
And there is such a solemn melody
Tween doleful songs tears and sad elegies
I had no eyes to guide me forth the room
They were so overcharged with water

FLAMINEO
Ill see ‘em

FRANCISCO
‘Twere much uncharity in you for your sight
Will add unto their tears

FLAMINEO grins He grabs the corner of the frame and
tears a WIPE across the screen - suddenly we are in the -
URSINI FAMILY VAULT INT DAY

- where CORNELIA ZANCHE and other LADIES wind MARCELLOs
corpse

FLAMINEO
I will see ‘em I1l discover
Their superstitious howling

CORNELIA
This rosemary is withered pray get fresh
I would have these herbs grow upon his grave
When I am dead and rotten Reach the bays

Hallowed it with my prayers I did not think
He should have wore it

ZANCHE
Look you who are yonder

CORNELIA
Oh reach me the flowers

ZANCHE

I have left more for myself

FRANCISCO
Lady whos this

CORNELIA
You are I take it the grave-maker

FLAMINEO
So

ZANCHE
Tis Flamineo

CORNELIA
Will you make me such a fool heres a white hand
Can blood so soon be washed out let me see
When screech-owls croak upon the chimney-tops
And the strange cricket in the oven sings and hops
When yellow spots do on your hands appear
Be certain then you of a corpse shall hear
Out upon it how ‘tis speckled He’s handled a toad

FLAMINEO

sure

I would I were from hence

CORNELIA
Do you hear sir
They would not bury him ‘cause he died in a quarrel
But I have an answer for them
Let holy church receive him duly
Since he paid the church-tithes truly
His wealth is summed and this is all his store
This poor men get and great men get no more

CORNELIA and the LADIES put away their things

CORNELIA
Now the wares are gone we may shut up shop
Bless you all good people

Exeunt FLAMINEO sits beside his brother’s body

FLAMINEO
I have a strange thing in me to the which
I cannot give a name without it be
Compassion I pray leave me

Exeunt COURTIERS

FLAMINEO

(to CAMERA)
This night Ill know the utmost of my fate
Ill be resolved what my rich sister means
To assign me for my service I have lived
Riotously ill like some that live in court
And sometimes when my face was full of smiles
Have felt the maze of conscience in my breast
Oft gay and honoured robes those tortures try
We think caged birds sing when indeed they cry

Through the tomb wall crashes a FEARSOME FIGURE
FLAMINEO pulls a knife -

Before him is BRACCIANOS GHOST in racer gear boots helmet
He carries a pot of lily flowers with a SKULL in it

FLAMINEO
Ha I can stand thee nearer nearer yet
What a mockery hath death made thee Thou lookest sad
In what place art thou In yon starry gallery
Or in the cursed dungeon No Not speak
Pray sir resolve me what religions best
For a man to die in Or is it in your knowledge
To answer me how long I have to live
Thats the most necessary question
Not answer Are you still to no purpose

The GHOST throws earth upon him and shows him the skull

FLAMINEO
Whats that oO fatal
A dead mans skull beneath the roots of flowers

ECU THE SKULL - amid roots bugs crawling therein

FLAMINEO
I pray speak sir

FLAMINEO looks up The GHOST has gone The walls have washed
away The background is a distant VOID with stars in it

FLAMINEO
Hes gone and see the skull and earth are vanished
This is beyond melancholy I do dare my fate
To do its worst Now to my sisters lodging
And sum up all those horrors the disgrace
The prince threw on me next the piteous sight
Of my dead brother and my mothers dotage
And last this terrible vision all these
Shall with Vittorias bounty turn to good
Or I will drown this weapon in her blood

He puts away his knife

ELIZABETHAN BANQUETING HALL INT NIGHT

- built in a basement beneath BRACCIANOs mansion

It doubles as a basketball court with hoops a high table
hogs heads suits of armour and baronial shields bearing
BRACCIANOs escutcheon

VITTORIA sits at the banqueting table studying her late
husband’s accounts ZANCHE does likewise on a second computer

FLAMINEO bursts in dragging a heavy backpack

FLAMINEO
What are you at your prayers Give over

VITTORIA
How ruffian

FLAMINEO
I come to you ‘bout worldly business
Sit down sit down Nay stay blowze you may hear it
The doors are fast enough

VITTORIA

Ha are you drunk

FLAMINEO
Yes yes with wormwood water you shall taste
Some of it presently

VITTORIA
What intends the fury

FLAMINEO
You are my lords executrix and I claim
Reward for my long service

VITTORIA
For your service

FLAMINEO
Come therefore set down
What you will give me

VITTORIA
There

She texts him

FLAMINEO
Ha have you done already
Tis a most short conveyance

He looks for it on his phone

VITTORIA
I will read it
I give that portion to thee and no other
Which Cain groaned under having slain his brother

FLAMINEO
A most courtly patent to beg by

VITTORIA
You are a villain

FLAMINEO
Is it come to this
Thou hast a devil in thee I will try
If I can scare him from thee Nay sit still
My lord hath left me yet two cases of jewels
You shall see them

He delves into his backpack -

VITTORIA
Sure hes distracted
ZANCHE
Oh hes desperate
For your own safety give him gentle language

- pulls out TWO of BRACCIANO’S DUELLING PISTOLS

FLAMINEO
Look these are better far at a dead lift
Than all your jewel house

VITTORIA
And yet methinks
These stones have no fair lustre they are ill set

FLAMINEO
Ill turn the right side towards you you shall see
How they will sparkle

VITTORIA
Turn this horror from me
What do you want What would you have me do
Is not all mine yours Have I any children

FLAMINEO
Do not trouble me
With this vain worldly business say your prayers
Neither yourself nor I should outlive him
The numbering of four hours

He stands before a large heroic portrait of BRACCIANO and
his CARS

VITTORIA
Did he enjoin it

FLAMINEO
He did and ‘twas a deadly jealousy
Lest any should enjoy thee after him
That urged him vow me to it For my death
I did propound it voluntarily knowing
If he could not be safe in his own court
Being a great duke what hope then for us

VITTORIA
This is your melancholy and despair

FLAMINEO
Away
Fool thou art to think that politicians
Do use to kill the effects of injuries
And let the cause live

VITTORIA
Will you hear me

FLAMINEO
My life hath done service to other men
My death shall serve mine own turn make you ready

VITTORIA
Do you mean to die indeed

FLAMINEO
With as much pleasure
As eer my father gat me

VITTORIA
Are the doors locked

ZANCHE
Yes madam

VITTORIA

Are you grown an atheist

(to ZANCHE)
Cry out for help

(to FLAMINEO)
Will you turn your body
Which is the goodly palace of the soul
To the souls slaughter-house

ZANCHE
Help help

FLAMINEO aims a PISTOL at ZANCHE

FLAMINEO
Ill stop your throat

VITTORIA
I pray thee yet remember
Millions are now in graves which at last day
Like mandrakes shall rise shrieking

FLAMINEO
Leave your prating
For these are but grammatical laments
Feminine arguments

ZANCHE
(aside)
Gentle madam
Seem to consent only persuade him to teach
The way to death let him die first

VITTORIA
Tis good I apprehend it
To kill ones self is meat that we must take
Like pills not chewed but quickly swallow it

FLAMINEO
I have held it
A wretched and most miserable life
Which is not able to die

VITTORIA
Oh but frailty
Yet I am now resolved farewell affliction
(to the portrait)
Behold Bracciano I that while you lived
Did make a flaming altar of my heart
To sacrifice unto you now am ready
To sacrifice heart and all Farewell Zanche

ZANCHE
How madam do you think that I1l outlive you
Especially when my best self Flamineo
Goes the same voyage

FLAMINEO
O most loved Moor

ZANCHE
Only by all my love let me entreat you
Since it is most necessary one of us
Do violence on ourselves let you or I
Be her sad taster teach her how to die

FLAMINEO

Thou dost instruct me nobly Take these pistols
Because my hand is stained with blood already
Two of these you shall level at my breast
The others -

(he indicates his backpack)
- against your own and so well die
Most equally contented but first swear
Not to outlive me

VITTORIA and ZANCHE
Most religiously

FLAMINEO
Then heres an end of me farewell daylight
I take my leave of thee

He hands VITTORIA and ZANCHE pistols

FLAMINEO

They

They

These are two cupping-glasses that shall draw
All my infected blood out Are you ready

BOTH
Ready

FLAMINEO
Whither shall I go now
Whether I resolve to fire earth water air
Or all the elements I know not
Nor greatly care

(tears open his shirt)

Shoot shoot
Of all deaths the violent death is best
For from ourselves it steals ourselves so fast
The pain once apprehended is quite past

shoot then run at him

VITTORIA
What are you dropped

FLAMINEO
I am mixed with earth already as you are noble
Perform your vows and bravely follow me

VITTORIA
Whither To hell

ZANCHE
To most assured damnation

stamp on him

ZANCHE
Thou art caught -

VITTORIA
In thine own engine I tread the fire out
That would have been my ruin

FLAMINEO
Will you be perjured Your religious oaths -

VITTORIA
Think whither thou art going

ZANCHE
Remember what villainies thou hast acted

FLAMINEO writhes on the floor clutching his guts Smoke
rises from his chest He seems to be dying painfully
FLAMINEO

O the ways dark and horrid I cannot see

Shall I have no company

VITTORIA
Oo yes thy sins

Do run before thee to fetch fire from hell

To light thee thither

FLAMINEO
O I smell soot
Most stinking soot the chimneys afire
My livers parboiled
Theres a plumber laying pipes in my guts
Wilt thou outlive me

ZANCHE
Yes and drive a stake
Through thy body for well give it out
Thou didst this violence upon thyself

FLAMINEO
O cunning devils Now I have tried your

it scalds

love

And doubled all your reaches I am not wounded

Like a Hollywood action villain in the last reel FLAMINEO
rises His clothes smoke from the powder burns but there

is no blood He has tricked them

FLAMINEO
The pistols held no bullets ‘twas a plot
To prove your kindness to me and I live
To punish your ingratitude

VITTORIA
O thou most cursed devil

FLAMINEO
Trust a woman
Never never Bracciano be my precedent
We lay our souls to pawn to the devil for

a little pleasure and a woman makes the bill

of sale

From the backpack he produces two more PISTOLS
Loaded this time

FLAMINEO
Here are two other instruments

ANGLE ON TWO HOODED PENITENTES

From the fueneral cortege passing through the

corridor
VITTORIA
Help help

FLAMINEO
What noise is that Hah False keys in the court

The PENITENTES pile on him

PENITENTE
Do you know us now

He throws back his hood It is LODOVICO FLAMINEO doesn’t
recognise him

LODOVICO
Lodovico And Gasparo
And that Moor your duke gave pension to
Was the great Duke of Florence

VITTORIA
Oh we are lost

FLAMINEO
You shall not take justice forth from my hands
Oh let me kill her

He tries to shoot VITTORIA GASPARO and LODOVICO seize
his guns

LODOVICO
Bind him to the pillar

VITTORIA
Oh your gentle pity
I have seen a blackbird that would sooner fly
To a mans bosom than to stay the gripe
Of the fierce sparrow-hawk

GASPARO
Your hope deceives you

VITTORIA
If Florence be in the court would he kill me

GASPARO
Fool Princes give rewards with their own hands

But death or punishment by the hands of others

LODOVICO
Dost laugh

FLAMINEO

Wouldst have me die as I was born in whining

GASPARO
Recommend yourself to heaven

FLAMINEO
No I will carry mine own commendations thither

LODOVICO
Oh I could kill you forty times a day
Four years together twere too little
What dost think on

FLAMINEO
Nothing of nothing Leave thy idle questions
I am in the way to study a long silence
To prate were idle I remember nothing
Theres nothing of so infinite vexation
As mans own thoughts

LODOVICO
O thou glorious strumpet
Could I divide thy breath from this pure air
When it leaves thy body I would suck it up
And breathe it upon some dunghill

VITTORIA
You my deaths-man
Methinks you have too good a face to be a hangman
If thou be do thy office in right form
Fall down upon thy knees and ask forgiveness

LODOVICO
O thou hast been a most prodigious comet
But Ill cut off your train Kill the Moor first

VITTORIA
You shall not kill her first Behold my breast -
I will be waited on in death my servant
Shall never go before me

GASPARO
Are you so brave

VITTORIA
Yes I shall welcome death
As princes do some great ambassadors
Ill meet thy weapon half way

LODOVICO
Thou dost tremble
Methinks fear should dissolve thee into air

VITTORIA
Oh thou art deceived I am too true a woman
I will not in my death shed one base tear
Or if look pale for want of blood not fear

The ASSASINS produce their guns

GASPARO
Thou art my task black fury

ZANCHE
I have blood
As red as either of theirs wilt drink some
Tis good for the falling-sickness I am proud
Death cannot alter my complexion
For I shall never look pale

LODOVICO
Strike strike
With a joint motion

They fire GASPARO’s shot kills ZANCHE outright LODOVICO
makes a mess of his VITTORIA and FLAMINEO are only wounded

VITTORIA
‘Twas a manly blow
The next thou givest murder some sucking infant
And then thou wilt be famous

FLAMINEO
Search my wound deeper tent it with the steel
That made it

LODOVICO tries to fire again His gun is jammed

VITTORIA
Oh my greatest sin lay in my blood
Now my blood pays fort

FLAMINEO
Thou art a noble sister
I love thee now if woman do breed man
She ought to teach him manhood Fare thee well
Know many glorious women that are famed
For masculine virtue have been vicious -

VITTORIA
My soul like to a ship in a black storm
Is driven I know not whither

FLAMINEO
Then cast anchor
Prosperity doth bewitch men seeming clear
But seas do laugh show white when rocks are near
We cease to grieve cease to be fortunes slaves
Nay cease to die by dying Art thou gone

VITTORIA dies
FLAMINEO tries to rise

FLAMINEO
I recover like a spent taper for a flash
And instantly go out I have caught
An everlasting cold I have lost my voice
Most irrecoverably Farewell glorious villains
This busy trade of life appears most vain
Since rest breeds rest where all seek pain by pain
Oh I am in a mist

The ASSASSINS make for the door As GASPARO goes first
LODOVICO throws his noose around his neck and starts to
strangle him

FLAMINEO recovers again

FLAMINEO
Let no harsh flattering bells resound my knell
Strike thunder and strike loud to my farewell

There is no thunder Disappointed he dies Loud banging
Then the doors crash open revealing PRINCE GIOVANNI GUARDS
AMBASSADORS and PAPERAZZI

LODOVICO
Ha are we betrayed

AMBASSADOR
Keep back the prince shoot shoot

A hail of gunfire cuts down LODOVICO and the choking GASPARO

GASPARO
O I am wounded

GIOVANNI
You bloody villains
By what authority have you committed
This massacre

LODOVICO
By thine

GIOVANNI
Mine
LODOVICO
Yes thy uncle which is a part of thee
enjoined us to it

GIOVANNI
He turned murderer
Away with them to prison and to torture
All that have hands in this shall taste our justice

LODOVICO
I do glory yet
That I can call this act mine own For my part

The rack the gallows and the torturing wheel
Shall be but -

A bag is thrown over his head before he can finish
ANGLE ON LITTLE GIOVANNI
Standing next to FLAMINEO’s corpse

GIOVANNI
Remove these bodies See my honoured lords -

He forgets his lines FRANCISCO DE MEDICIS off-screen
coaches the prince

FRANCISCO 0S
What use you ought make of their punishment

Hold on FLAMINEO’s corpse It is PHOTOGRAPHED
GIOVANNI and FRANCISCO 0S

Let guilty men remember their black deeds
Do lean on crutches made of slender reeds
