among the presentation boards with the U-2 imagery stops in
front of the picture of the six canvas-covered objects It
unleashes a wave of memories

KENNY

to the President knowing what they must be

INT WEST WING HALLWAY - DAY

Lundahl standing at the end of the room with briefing

LUNDAHL
Gentlemen as most of you now know a U-2

series of disturbing photographs
SWINGING THE POINTER AT A BOARD SMASH CUTS US TO

EXT MISSILE SITE - LOS PALACIOS CUBA - DAY

The sweltering Cuban countryside
stripped to the waist glistening with sweat

TROOPS

a clearing under scattered limp palm trees

A bulldozer TEARS through the undergrowth

SCREEN

cargo

LUNDAHL (V0O)
Our analysis at NPIC indicates the
Soviet Union has followed its
conventional weapons build-up in Cuba
with the introduction of surface-to
surface medium-range ballistic missiles
or MRBMs Our official estimate at this
time is that this missile system is the
SS-4 Sandal We do not believe these
missiles are as yet operational

Shouting SOVIET ROCKET

FILLING THE

A 70-foot long MISSILE TRANSPORTER creeps along in
the bulldozers wake like a vast hearse with its shrouded

INT CABINET ROOM - DAY

Lundahl raps his second board a map of the United States

Cuba visible in the lower corner
the US encompassing the entire Southeast

across

LUNDAHL
IRONBARK reports the SS-4 can deliver a
3-megaton nuclear weapon 1000 miles So

far we have identified 32 missiles
served by around 3400 men undoubtedly
all Soviet personnel Our cities and
military installations in the Southeast
as far north as Washington are in range
of these weapons and in the event of a
launch would only have five minutes of
warning

GENERAL CARTER
Five minutes gentlemen Five minutes

GENERAL TAYLOR
In those five minutes they could kill 80
million Americans and destroy a
significant number of our bomber bases
degrading our retaliatory options The
Joint Chiefs consensus is that this is

An ARC is drawn clearly
a massively destabilizing move
upsetting the nuclear balance

The President stares at Lundahl and beating out each word

THE PRESIDENT
Arthur Are You Sure

Lundahl looks around the room Everyone is hanging

LUNDAHL
Yes Mr President These are nuclear
missiles

The men come to grips with their own fears own anger

BOBBY
How long until theyre operational

LUNDAHL
General Taylor can answer that question
better than I can

General Taylor drops a memo on the table WHICH BECOMES
EXT FIELD TABLE - MISSILE SITE CUBA - DAY

SCHEMATICS slapped down on a camp table A group of Soviet
site ENGINEERS point and gesture as they study their ground
from a shaded hillock CLEARING CREWS and SURVEYORS work and
sweat in the distance

GENERAL TAYLOR (VO)
GMAIC estimates ten to fourteen days
However a crash program to ready the
missiles could cut that time

INT CABINET ROOM - DAY
Taylor sees the grim looks all around

GENERAL TAYLOR
I have to stress that there may be more
missiles that we dont know about We
need more U-2 coverage

Kenny lets out his breath He catches Bobbys eye This is
unbelievable

THE PRESIDENT
Is there any indication - anything at
all - that suggests they intend to use
these missiles in some sort of first
strike

GENERAL CARTER
Not at present sir But I think the
prudent answer is we dont know

THE PRESIDENT
Do we have any sort of intelligence from
CIA on what Khruschev is thinking

GENERAL CARTER
No Mr President We dont We just
dont know whats happening inside the
Kremlin at that level

BOBBY
They lied to us Two weeks ago Dobrynin
told me to my face Khurschev had no
intention of putting missiles into Cuba
They said themselves this is our
backyard

Theres angry agreement The President cuts it off

THE PRESIDENT
Gentlemen I want first reactions
Assuming for a moment Khruschev has not
gone off the deep end and intends to
start World War Three what are we
looking at

Rusk glances to his team at the end of the table Ball
Johnson Martin Thompson and Stevenson

RUSK
Mr President I believe my team is in
agreement If we permit the
introduction of nuclear missiles to a
Soviet satellite nation in our
hemisphere the diplomatic consequences
will be too terrible to contemplate
The Russians are trying to show the
world they can do whatever they want
wherever they want and were powerless
to stop them If they succeed

BOBBY
It will be Munich all over again
RUSK
Appeasement only makes the aggressor
more aggressive Confidence in our
security commitments around the world
will falter allies will become unsure
in the face of Soviet pressure and the
Soviets will be emboldened to push us
even harder We must remove the
missiles one way or another It seems
to me the options are either to build up
the crisis til they give in or we hit
them An air strike

Theres silence at the table Some nods Understanding

THE PRESIDENT
Bob

MCNAMARA
Weve worked up several military
scenarios Before I ask General Taylor
to lead us through the various options
Id like for us to adopt a rule
If we are going to strike we must agree
now that we will do it before the
missiles become operational Because
once they are I dont think we can
guarantee getting them all before at
least some are launched

And there it is The clock is running

BUNDY
Sir We need to consider if we
decide to act theres a good chance
well end up in a general war

The room falls silent The President leans back in his
chair studying the circle of men around the table weighing
them

Kenny and the others watch him in silence A long dramatic
pause A course that will change history is about to be
chosen The President leans forward folds his hands on the
table Fated Grave

THE PRESIDENT
Its clear we cannot permit Soviet
nuclear missiles in Cuba We must get
those missiles out

EXT THE ROSE GARDEN - DAY
Kenny and Bobby follow the President down a path through the
Rose Garden The shock of the morning has worn off The
President stops looks at them

THE PRESIDENT
I dont think its going to matter what
Khruschevs intentions are I tell you
right now I dont see any way around
hitting them

A long moment of silence as they move along again

KENNY
If we hit em kill a lot of Russians
theyll move against Berlin They
attack Berlin thats NATO and were
at war

The guys stop again The autumn day is bright warm alive
The air the distant city sounds derail the relentless train
of logic for a beat And in their faces we see that all
three men for the first time feel the enormity of war its
shadow over everything Its only a couple of steps away
Steps that theyre seriously contemplating

BOBBY
Damned if we do but if we dont were
in a war for sure somewhere else in six
months

Pained the President turns away

THE PRESIDENT
No choice This is going to cost lives
any way we go Do nothing and it could
be 80 million of ours We have to get
rid of those missiles

KENNY
Thereve got to be alternatives to just
going out and bombing them

BOBBY
Hes right Jack Taylor is saying we
may have some time Weve got to use
it

THE PRESIDENT
So if there are alternatives that make
sense - and Im not saying there are -
we need em Need em fast
BOBBY
What about the allies Congress I
think we may need to start letting key
people know And theyre all scattered
across the country for the campaign
Were going to need to get the UN
staff in and warmed up Jesus I
dont even know if weve got secure
communications with half our embassies
since that the Soviets got that
cryptographer of ours

THE PRESIDENT
We cant worry about everything right
now Weve got to figure out what were
going to do before we worry about how we
do it

KENNY
The other thing is

BOBBY
I know CIA and the military fucked
us on the Bay of Pigs

KENNY
Theyre going to be pressing for a
military solution soon We cant afford
to let them ram their agenda down our
throats We need to come with options
other than air strikes so we have some
sort of choice here

BOBBY
We got a bunch of smart guys We lock
em up together in there kick em in
the ass til they come up with options

Kenny and the President look at him Bobby nods

BOBBY (CONTD)
Ill do it

KENNY
(to the President)
Its too politicized with you in there
anyway They need to be able to stick
their necks out

BOBBY
Itll be the principals a couple of the
key guys from each department the
Executive Committee of the National
Security Council Well call it EXCOM

Kenny snorts a laugh Bobby shoots him a cross look

KENNY
EXCOM Has a ring to it Like F-Troop

The President stops Bobby and Kenny stop too

THE PRESIDENT

Okay Kenny and I only show for the
meetings you call us into Impress us
And do it fast

(to Kenny)
Youre in charge of keeping this quiet
If word gets out before we know what
were going to do therell be panic
And itll ruin any chance of surprise if
we decide to hit them

KENNY

Then we need to do a few things right
away No Pierre He knows the press
knows
Youre going to have to keep up your
schedule - your movements are followed
too closely And we need to get these
guys out of the White House George
Balls got a conference room at State

(to Bobby)
Reconvene over there this afternoon

Bobby nods

BOBBY
I think we should bring in Dean Acheson
He was fighting Soviets while we were
still working the wards in Boston

The President nods his approval Looks at Kenny
THE PRESIDENT

all the help we can get

plane pylons laden with weapons GROUND CREW servicing them

INT CABINET ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Other EXCOM members draw near the board its order of battle
strike maps Theyre grim but fascinated Empowering
Intoxicating Sexy enny sees it in the faces even the
Presidents Adlai does too is upset

ADLAT
I still think there are diplomatic
approaches we havent considered yet

Kenny looks at Adlai The others around the room
embarrassed dont respond The group has moved on and
Stevenson hasnt

GENERAL TAYLOR
We have high confidence in the expanded
air strike option
(beat)
The problem Mr President is that its
a short-term solution Khruschev can
send more missiles next month The
Chiefs and I believe we should follow up
the air strikes with the full version of
OPLAN 316

THE PRESIDENT
An invasion

GENERAL TAYLOR
Yes sir We can be sure we get all the
missiles and we remove Castro so this
can never happen again

Kenny looks around the room at the men the murmurs of
general agreement senses the consensus building and is
agitated

THE PRESIDENT
Is this the Chiefs recommendation

GENERAL TAYLOR
Yes sir Our best option is to
commence the strikes before the missiles
are operational The invasion happens
eight days later

The President leans back in his chair turns to the man at
the far end of the table DEAN ACHESON 60s former Secretary
of State He sits silent like some revered oracle the
architect of the American Cold War strategy of containment

THE PRESIDENT
Dean What do you think

Acheson arches an eyebrow and when he speaks his voice
resonates throughout the room powerful smooth hypnotic

ACHESON
Mr President you have rightly
dismissed the diplomatic option The
Soviet will only tie you down in
negotiation and leave us short of our
goal the removal of the missiles
Negotiating will do nothing more than
give them time to make the missiles
operational complicating the necessary
military task we have at hand

Everyone in the room listens to him with rapt attention his
presence overshadowing the room oracular

ACHESON (CONTD)
For the last fifteen years I have
fought here at this table along side
your predecessors in the struggle
against the Soviet Gentlemen I do not
wish to seem melodramatic but I do wish
to impress upon you one observation with
all conceivable sincerity A lesson I
have learned with bitter tears and great
sacrifice

(beat)
The Soviet understands only one
language action It respects only one
word force

Kenny stares at the old man Achesons gaze finds his
through the cigarette smoke Achesons eyes travel to the
President

ACHESON (CONTD)
I concur with General Taylor I
recommend sir air strikes followed by
invasion perhaps preceded by an
ultimatum to dismantle the missiles if
military necessity permits

Taylor nods vindicated The others murmur their approval
Bobby at the table in front of Kenny and to his left trades
a dire look with Kenny This is happening too fast Bobby
holds his head looks about at the others deeply distressed

The President sinks back in his chair staring at Acheson

THE PRESIDENT
Then it appears we have three options
Number one A surgical air strike
against the missiles themselves Two a
larger air strike against their air
defenses along with the missiles

Kenny eyes Bobby Bobby is writing something

THE PRESIDENT (CONTD)
And three invasion

Bobby looks over his shoulder at Kenny and REACHES BACK to
him with a folded NOTE Kenny takes it opens it

It reads NOW I KNOW WHO TOJO FELT PLANNING PEARL HARBOR
THE PRESIDENT (CONTD)

Were certainly going to do number one
were going to take out these missiles
so it seems to me we dont have to wait
very long We ought to at least be
making those preparations

Kenny gives Bobby a curt nod Bobby tilts his head at the
President pass the note on to him Kenny rises slips the
note in front of the President

The President unfolds the note and we HOLD ON IT and his
reaction as in the bg out of focus Taylor speaks

GENERAL TAYLOR
Yes sir were preparing to implement
all three options though I must stress
again sir there are risks to the
strikes without the follow-on invasion

Bundy clears his throat Speaks from somewhere down the
table

BUNDY
You want to be clear Mr President
that we have definitely decided against
a political track

The President folds the note away glances at Bobby A beat
the President looks from Bobby to Acheson

THE PRESIDENT
Dean how does this play out

ACHESON
Your first step sir will be to demand
that the Soviet withdraw the missiles
within 12 to 24 hours They will
refuse When they do you will order
the strikes followed by the invasion
They will resist but will be overrun
They will retaliate against a target
somewhere else in the world most likely
Berlin We will honor our treaty
commitments and resist them there
defeating them per our plans

THE PRESIDENT
Those plans call for the use of nuclear
weapons
(beat)
And what is the next step

Acheson sits back in his chair smooths his moustache A
dramatic beat and then his ominous pronouncement rings out
ACHESON
Hopefully cooler heads will prevail
before we reach the next step

A chill runs down Kennys spine He looks in shock to the
President The President remains calm But in place of the
fated look the President has had theres a hesitation

INT WEST WING HALLS - NIGHT

Acheson strides down the hall Taylor Sweeney Carter and
Bundy swept along behind him Bundy is on the defensive the
others grim

GENERAL TAYLOR
If McNamarad get off the fence

BUNDY
We have time

GENERAL CARTER
Goddamn it its obvious Its the only
option That asshole Stevenson We
cant let this drag out or we lose our
shot

BUNDY
Bombing them

ACHESON
Remember that the Kennedys father was
one of the architects of Munich The
General is right There is only one
responsible choice here

Bundy just nods Taylor grabs a door ahead for Acheson
ACHESON (CONTD)
Lets pray appeasement doesnt run in
families I fear weakness does
And the men head into a stairwell going down

INT OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT

Grimacing in pain He opens a pill bottle takes two pills
out He takes a whiskey in a shot glass from Kenny

RESUME

Kenny finishes pouring him and Bobby a couple of more shots
discreetly turning a blind eye to the Presidents pain

The President returns from his desk shirt untucked
disheveled back stiff He eases into his rocking chair
Bobby lies sprawled on the couch Kenny sits down They all
look at each other A beat something like shock

KENNY
Jesus Christ Almighty

They burst out laughing An absurd tension draining moment
They shoot their drinks Kenny refills

KENNY (CONTD)
Call me Irish but I dont believe in
cooler heads prevailing

THE PRESIDENT
Achesons scenario is unacceptable And
he has more experience than anyone

KENNY
There is no expert on this subject no
wise old man

The President stares Kenny in the face understanding

THE PRESIDENT
The thing is Achesons right Talk
alone wont accomplish anything

Kenny considers the President his face straight as he says

KENNY
Then lets bomb the shit out of them
Everyone wants to even you even me
(theres a point)
It sure would feel good

The President sees what Kennys saying itd be an emotional
response not necessarily the intelligent one

BOBBY
Jack Im as conniving as they come but
a sneak attack is just wrong

KENNY
Hes right And things are happening
too fast It smells like the Bay of
Pigs all over again

Bobby picks up some reconnaissance photos on the coffee
table

BOBBY
As if dealing with the Russians wasnt
hard enough we gotta worry about our
own house

THE PRESIDENT
Tonight listening to Taylor and
Acheson I kept seeing Burke and Dulles
telling me all I had to do was sign on
the dotted line The invasion would
succeed Castro would be gone Just
like that Easy

The President is rendered mute by a wave of pain Kenny and
Bobby aver their eyes When it passes the President is
hushed grave

THE PRESIDENT (CONTD)
Theres somethingimmoral about
abandoning your own judgement

Kenny nods moved The President reaches out for the
reconnaissance photos Bobbys flipping through Bobby hands
them to him The President looks them over And when he
speaks theres humility And resolve

THE PRESIDENT (CONTD)

We cant let things get ahead of
themselves Weve got to control what
happens
Were going to do what we have to make
this come out right EXCOM is our first
weapon

(beat)
Well resort to others as we need ‘em

Kenny steps INTO FRAME back here at the fringes of the
crowd

THE PRESIDENT (0S)
Doesnt anybody in Connecticut have to

The crowd goes nuts Kenny paces checks his watch
impatient to be done with the necessary diversion Kenny
gazes off to his right and spots Scotty Reston along with
half the White House press corps suckered along Scotty
catches Kennys look

Kenny turns away but Scotty comes weaving over The
President continues on but all we hear is Scotty and Kenny

RESTON

RESTON

INT GEORGE BALLS CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

EXCOM meets in George Balls small conference room at the
State Department Bobby in shirtsleeves paces at the head
of the table very very alone All eyes are on him

BOBBY
No No No There is more than one
option here If one isnt occurring to
us its because we havent thought hard

enough

McNamara squirms The others react in frustration CIA
chief JOHN MCCONE sharp tough conservative is harsh

MCCONE
Sometimes there is only one right
choice and you thank God when its
clear

BOBBY
Youre talking about a sneak attack
Howll that make us look Big country
blasting a little one into the stone
age Well be real favorites around the
world

ACHESON
Bobby thats naive This is the real
world you know that better than
anybody Your argument is ridiculous

MCCONE
You werent so ethically particular when
we were talking about options for
removing Castro over at CIA

And theres nothing Bobby can say to that He props himself
up on the table stares at it as if theres an answer in its
shiny surface somewhere There is only the reflection of his
own face

BOBBY
I cant let my brother go down in
History like a villain like a Tojo
ordering another Pearl Harbor

McCone Acheson and Taylor share a look The last
resistance to airstrikes is crumbling Finally Bobby looks
up at McNamara

BOBBY (CONTD)
Bob If we go ahead with these air

strikes

(beat)
Theres got to be something else Give
it to me I dont care how crazy

inadequate or stupid it sounds
(beat pleading)
Give it to me

McNamara suffers under the gaze of everyone at the table
weighing the situation out And finally he ventures

MCNAMARA
Six months ago we gamed out a scenario
Its slow It doesnt get rid of the
missiles There are a lot of drawbacks
(beat)
The scenario was for a blockade of Cuba

SUPER THURSDAY OCTOBER 18TH DAY 3
INT OVAL OFFICE - DAY

Kenny enters the office from his side door in the middle of a
debate Military uniforms dominate the room General Taylor
General Sweeney and a host of briefing officers

GENERAL TAYLOR
The situation is worse than we thought
We count 40 missiles now longer range
IRBMs They can hit every city in the
continental US

The President stares out the window at the Rose Garden his
back to Air Force Chief of Staff GENERAL CURTIS LEMAY 60
Beetle-browed arrogant the archetypal Cold War general
Yet there is something about him his intelligence perhaps
that suggests hes playing a role he knows and believes in

The only other civilians in the room are Bobby Bundy and
McNamara The pressure from the military is almost physical

LEMAY
Mr President as of this moment my
planes are ready to carry out the air
strikes All you have to do is give me
the word sir and my boys will get
those Red bastards

The President continues staring out the window Kenny eases
over to the desk leans on it arms folded interposing
himself between the President and the soldiers Bobby joins
him side-by-side

That makes the President turn around

Taylor

He spares a look at McNamara

folded

THE PRESIDENT
How long until the army is ready

GENERAL TAYLOR
Weve just begun the mobilization under
cover of a pre-arranged exercise sir
Were looking at another week anda
half Mr President

LEMAY
But you can begin the strikes now The
plans call for an eight-day air
campaign Itd light a fire under the
armys ass to get in place

THE PRESIDENT
General LeMay do you truly believe
thats our best course of action

LEMAY
Mr President I believe it is the only
course of action American is in
danger Those missiles are a threat to
our bomber bases and the safety of our
nuclear deterrent Without our
deterrent theres nothing to keep the
enemy from choosing general nuclear war
Its our duty our responsibility to the
American people to take out those
missiles and return stability to the
strategic situation The Big Red Dog is
digging in our back yard and were
justified in shooting him

stare at LeMay

steps in softly smoothly good cop to LeMays bad

GENERAL TAYLOR
Sir we have a rapidly closing window of
opportunity where we can prevent those
missiles from ever becoming operational
The other options

serious

GENERAL TAYLOR (CONTD)
do not guarantee the end result we
can guarantee However the more time

who watches the fireworks

arms
that goes by the less reliable the
choice we can offer you becomes

The President partially defused looks from Taylor to
McNamara LeMay steps forward softer now sincere

LEMAY
Mr President the motto I chose for SAC
is Peace is our Profession God

forbid we find ourselves in a nuclear
exchange But if launched those
missiles in Cuba would kill a lot of
Americans Thats why Im being such a
pain in the ass about destroying them
Destroying them immediately Hell even
Mac agrees

Bundy is uncomfortable Everyone turns to him He nods

Kenny realizes hes been co-opted by the military

McNamara

does too lets out a deep breath The President eyes Bundy

then paces out from behind his desk

Kenny

THE PRESIDENT
General what will the Soviets do when
we attack

LEMAY
Nothing

Bobby and the President look at each other

believe what they just heard

THE PRESIDENT
Nothing

LEMAY
Nothing Because the only alternative
open to them is one they cant choose

His pronouncement hangs there in the air ominous

THE PRESIDENT
Those arent just missiles well be
destroying We kill Soviet soldiers
and they will respond How would we
respond if they killed ours No they
will do something General I promise
you that And I believe itll be
Berlin

shoving for a vantage at the side door to the Oval Office
waiting for the Gromyko photo-op Kenny stands shoulder-to
shoulder with Reston and Sorensen near the door

RESTON
Are they going to discuss the military
exercises going on in Florida

Kenny doesnt even blink but Sorensen does a poorer job at
hiding his reaction

KENNY
Come on Scotty This meetings been on
the books for months Its just a
friendly talk on US-Soviet relations

Fortunately the conversation is cut short as a dozen
FLASHBULBS suddenly go off on a dozen cameras as the
reporters crush in on the Oval Office and Reston is swept

So that there should be no
misunderstanding the position of the
United States which has been made clear
by the Attorney General to Ambassador
Dobrynin here I shall read a sentence
from my own statement to the press dated
September 13th

(beat reading)

Should missiles or offensive weapons be
placed in Cuba it would present the
gravest threat to US national
security

The President stares at Gromyko as the translator finishes
translating Gromyko sits there enigmatic cold
unreadable The translator finishes and Gromyko stops him
with a gesture so he can answer in his own accented English

GROMYKO
Mr President this will never be done
You need not be concerned

The President hides his fury masterfully and gazing over his
glasses asks

THE PRESIDENT
So I do not misunderstand you there are
no offensive weapons in Cuba

A beat And Gromykos response is flat sure steady
GROMYKO
No Mr President We have sent

defensive weapons only to Cuba

Kennys blazing eyes could drill holes in the back of
Gromykos head His gaze swings to the PRESIDENTS DESK

RESTON
There are major rail disruptions in the

Reston is taken aback Stung silence for a beat Kennys
response is far louder than any yes Now Kenny realizes
it
RESTON
Youve never threatened me before

INT WHITE HOUSE MANSION - OVAL ROOM - DAY

The White House Oval ROOM opulent filled with priceless art
and furniture but cramped EXCOM members crowd around the
center coffee table and the President enny stands behind
him with Bobby Rusk rises from his seat formal

RUSK
Mr President our deliberations have
led us to the conclusion that for the
moment a blockade of offensive weapons
to Cuba is our best option But well
still need a strong showing of support
from the Organization of American States
to give us an umbrella of legitimacy

At long last Kenny looks at Bobby relieved Theyve
bought time to find a settlement Bobby smiles a small
smile what were you so worried about

MCNAMARA
A blockade is technically an act of war
therefore we recommend calling the
action a quarantine

The President He listens looks over the briefing papers as
McNamara continues Everyone watches the President

MCNAMARA
A quarantine prevents more missiles from
reaching Cuba but it doesnt remove the
ones already there It gives the
Soviets a chance to pull back without
war If they refuse to remove the
missiles before theyre operational we
retain the option to strike or invade

BOBBY
We believe that a surprise attack would
be counter to what the United States
stands for We believe that an attack
leaves us no room for maneuver and the
inevitable Soviet response will force us
into a war we do not want A war that
this time will really end all war

MCCONE
Mr President there are still those of
us who believe we should proceed with
the strikes With the blockade we lose
strategic surprise and we run the risk
of a first strike if the Soviets decide
they have to use the missiles or lose
them

The President gazes from one expectant face to another But
he himself remains unreadable

THE PRESIDENT
Quarantine or air strike

Adlai clears his throat Everyone looks over at him He
stares down at his clasped hands for a beat Hes anguished
about what hes going to say

ADLAT
There is a third option With either
course we undertake the risk of nuclear
war It seems to me maybe one of us in
here should be a coward

He smiles weakly but gets no response from anyone
ADLAI (CONTD)
So I guess Ill be Our third choice is
to cut a deal We trade Guantanamo and
our missiles in Turkey get them to pull
their missiles out We employ a back
channel attribute the idea to U Thant
U Thant then raises it at the UN

Adlai looks for support around the room but meets only stony
gazes From McCone and General Taylor contempt Dead
silence for a long long beat

Kennys heart goes out to Stevenson as he watches the man
commit political suicide Even Sorensen standing behind
him unconsciously moves away At last the President speaks

THE PRESIDENT

I dont think thats possible Adlai

dont care anymore Ima political
dead man You ever seen a man cut his

deeply moved at his friends Gethsemane

THE PRESIDENT

Sweeney glances at LeMay LeMays stern frozen look wills

missiles we know about

sucking us in like a maelstrom but at the last second the

and the vast war machine crawls away underneath joining --

-- a long LINE of identical behemoths in single file inching

Good evening my fellow citizens This

the closest surveillance of the Soviet
military build-up on the island of
Cuba

EXT BARKSDALE AFB - NIGHT

The first B-52 trundles to a stop at the end of the runway
It begins to throttle-up the ROAR of its engine mounting

THE PRESIDENT (VO)
unmistakable evidence has now
established the fact that a series of
missile sites is in preparation on that
imprisoned island The purpose of these
bases can be none other than to proved a
nuclear strike capability against the
Western Hemisphere

-- AND DROWNING OUT the Presidents speech as the plane
lurches forward down the runway into the night

EXT MISSILE SILO - NIGHT

The Titan solo door GRINDS OPEN And the missile inside

THE PRESIDENT (V0O)
Therefore in the defense of our own

following initial steps be taken
First to halt this offensive build-up
a strict quarantine --

EXT CARRIBEAN SEA - NIGHT

The Presidents words conjure the ESSEX battlegroup its
destroyers plunging through heavy seas lit up in the night

THE PRESIDENT (V0O)
-- on all offensive military equipment
under shipment to Cuba is being
initiated All ships of any kind bound
for Cuba if found to contain cargoes of
offensive weapons will be turned back
Second I have directed the continued
and increased close surveillance of Cuba
and its military build-up Should these
offensive military preparations
continue further action will be
justified --

THE PRESIDENT (V0O)
-- I have directed the Armed Forces to
prepare for any eventualities

INT OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT
A beat And the President looks up from his notes
THE PRESIDENT

And third it shall be the policy of
this nation to regard any nuclear
missile launched from Cuba against any
nation in the Western Hemisphere as an
attack by the Soviet Union on the United
States requiring a full retaliatory
response upon the Soviet Union

The chilling words hang there in the air BLEEDING IN the
rising and falling WOOP WOOP WOOP WOOP which becomes --

EXT CARRIBEAN SEA - NIGHT

-- the voice of the Essex battlegroup sparkling alive a
constellation of lights scattered across the sea One by one
the escort ships answer the carriers SIREN with their own
wailing cries an alien chorus among the ships disappearing
and reappearing in the swells The communication crescendos
to its fever pitch --

-- and then the battlegroup goes to blackout Like a dying
universe the answering sirens cut off the life-lights wink
out and an appalling darkness falls across the sea

MCNAMARA
Were concerned about the possibility of
an incident with an innocent cargo
carrier If it turns ugly the Russians
could use an ugly incident and bad world
opinion as leverage to force us to
remove the quarantine

escalate

KENNY
Theyre boxing us in with these rules of

one of our planes gets knocked down or
one of the ships wont stop for
inspection the Chiefs will have us by
the balls and will force us to start
shooting They want a war and theyre
arranging things to get one If you
dont want one we have to do something
about it

The President understands He shakes his head paces away

THE PRESIDENT
How does a man get to a place where he
can say throw those lives away so
easily

KENNY
Maybe its harder for them to say it
than they let on
At the very least they believe its in
our best interest And at the end of
the day they may end up being right
The President turns away considers Then turns back

THE PRESIDENT
Triple check everything the Chiefs say
to us with the guys who actually have to
do it No ones to know about this but

arent as advertised youre going to
make sure they come out the way I want

stopping a submarine first

MCNAMARA (0S)
Im afraid not Mr President The sub
has positioned itself between the Pierce
and the Soviet ships Admiral Anderson
insists its too much of a risk to
proceed with stopping the freighters
The Pierce would be a sitting duck for
the sub

All around the room frustration Bobby shakes his head
Kenny sinks back in his chair The President hesitates

THE PRESIDENT
Put me through to the Pierce

INT FLAG PLOT - DAY

Admiral Anderson nods to a COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER The man
makes the connection on a switchboard

whether its damaged or not is up to the
sub

INT SITUATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS
The President lowers the phone looks to Bobby and Kenny

MCCONE
Even if they force it up that sub will
be inspected over the crews dead

face gray hand over his mouth The time of decision is at
hand He lifts the phone once again

The Watch Officers hands fly from one notation to the other
circling the Soviet ships marking them DEAD IN THE WATER

MCNAMARA

INT SITUATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS

The room EXPLODES victorious Kenny and Bobby break into
big grins grab each other Kenny pumps the Presidents

RUSK
We were eyeball to eyeball and I think
the other fellow just blinked

The ruckus goes on for a minute McCone comes back in

MCCONE

His voice is lost in the celebration McCone calls out

MCCONE (CONTD)
Mr President

The hubub dies away

MCCONE (CONTD)
Sir we have the tally from NSA We
have twenty ships stopping and or
turning around Six however appear to
be continuing for the line Including
the Gagarin and Kimovsk

The elation goes out of the room Kenny looks at the
President The President picks up the phone again

THE PRESIDENT
Captain have the ships youre observing
changed course

CAPTAIN (0S)
No Mr President Theyve just crossed
the quarantine line

Bobby grips the edge of the table immediately believing

BOBBY
Its an accident They must not have
gotten their orders yet Let em go

GENERAL TAYLOR
Unlikely Mr President Weve been
monitoring transmissions from both the
Gagarin and Kimovsk Their radios are
working fine

MCCONE
One ship an accident maybe Six this
is intentional
The President looks to Bobby He has no answer Kennys
mind races over the variables and he leans forward intense
suddenly understanding in a flash of insight

KENNY
Theyre right This is intentional

He glances around the room All of EXCOM is looking at him
Bobby stares at Kenny too shocked to feel betrayed

KENNY (CONTD)
Khruschevs stopped the 20 ships which
are carrying contraband and hes
letting the ones which arent go
through hoping for an incident I
think we should let them go

Bobby relaxes Around the table there are nods

MCCONE
If we do it erodes the credibility of
the quarantine Hell just send more
through tomorrow

The President looks at Kenny

KENNY
Then we deal with it tomorrow But
today hes stopped most of them Hes
done something smart here We gave him
an ultimatum and hes agreed to most of
it preserving just enough room to save
face We need to do something just as
smart now

Bobbys nodding following the argument Kenny looks around
the room for support

INT FLAG PLOT - THE PENTAGON - CONTINUOUS
McNamara pacing on the phone jumps in

MCNAMARA
Mr President I agree Let them go
Four of the six continuing ships are
still a day away from the line Theyve
stopped all the ones we suspect have
weapons aboard
It would look bad shooting up a
freighter full of baby food

INT SITUATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS
The President holds Kennys gaze then lifts the phone

THE PRESIDENT

with those ships Do nothing until I
order otherwise Is that clear

KENNY
Give it a rest You were thinking the
same thing just didnt have the guts to
take the heat

Bobby likes getting under Kennys skin Bobby aims a punch
at his head which Kenny knocks away The President changes
gear serious

THE PRESIDENT
We can horsetrade with Khruschev on
ships But it doesnt get us any closer
to removing those missiles

KENNY
Have to hope its a signal that hell
back down on the real issue too

BOBBY
Were going to have to stop a ship
eventually show the quarantines got
teeth or well prove McCone right

THE PRESIDENT
McNamaras on his way back here now We
need to pick the right ship No subs
No armed boarding parties either We
need a little more time to figure this
one out

KENNY
Then lets move the quarantine line

Its a simple suggestion The President considers hima
beat and then McNamara emerges from the White House heads
for them The three friends assume their more reserved
political faces as he comes up

MCNAMARA
Mr President Bobby Kenny The
Essex battle group has the Gagarin
Kimovsk and the sub escort under their
thumb Weve got a few hours now before
we need to worry about any more
flashpoints on the line
(beat)
We could use a few more hours I think
we should consider moving the quarantine
line back to 500 miles

Bobby and the President look at Kenny like hes some kind of
Svengali enny just stands there poker faced

INT WEST WING - DAY

Kenny and McNamara enter the White House from the South Lawn
They stride down the hall side by side

KENNY

stop a ship eventually

They turn a corner silence for a beat

KENNY
The Chiefs are looking for a provocation
out there The Presidents going to
come under enormous pressure You have
to keep em on a short leash Bob

McNamara spares Kenny a short nasty look
MCNAMARA

You must think Im blind and stupid
Ive already gotten the birds and bees

KENNY

purview It was your job to make sure
Bissel wasnt fucking us over and you
didnt do it Youve got the most
important job in the world right now
Youre the smartest guy the President
has

(beat)
Besides me

That gets an amused snort from McNamara breaking the
tension

MCNAMARA
Anybody ever tell you youre an
egomaniac and a prick ODonnell

Kenny stares him in the eye serious hushed A friend

KENNY

GENERAL TAYLOR
We are not at war sir not until were
at DEFCON 1

THE PRESIDENT
General the Joint Chiefs have just
signalled our intent to escalate to the
Soviets You have signalled an
escalation which I had no wish to
signal and which I did not approve

But Taylor knows this very well And the way hes suffering
its clear hes taking the heat for his underlings From
over on the couch Bobby chimes in

BOBBY
LeMay hes history

The President glances at Kenny who stands there speechless

THE PRESIDENT
Get out of here Max

The General leaves Kenny closes the door wanders deeper
into the office He looks from the President to Bobby
Theres a long long beat of shocked silence

KENNY
Jesus

BOBBY
Rescind the order Can all the Chiefs
Put Nitze Gilpatric and the
Undersecretaries in charge

KENNY
We cant do that Bobby
THE PRESIDENT
Hes right we cant rescind DEFCON 2
The Soviets will think weve gotten
sweet on them

KENNY
And we cant purge the Chiefs Our
invasion talk will look like a bluff
Or even that theres been an attempted
coup

Bobby is disgusted but knows theyre right

BOBBY
McNamara wont be able to handle them
Its too much for one man
(knowing look to Kenny)
with all due respect to our heroic
fifth column

The President collapses in his rocking chair Kenny leans
over the back of the sofa next to Bobby

KENNY
Weve got Khruschevs attention with the
blockade If we want a political

solution I think its time to turn up
the diplomatic heat Cause if we let
this go on too long were going to find
ourselves in a war

Bundy turns back to him

BUNDY

toughness to stand up to --

KENNY
-- You listen to me Nobody nobody

Kennedys They may be wrong They make
mistakes But theyre not weak
The weak ones are these people who

Adlai pauses Then as the first SECURITY COUNCIL MEMBERS
begin to notice him he heads for the vacant seats for the
American delegation The ROMANIAN DELEGATE saws the air

ROMANIAN DELEGATE

we call upon the world to condemn
this purely American provocation

But as the Romanian wheezes on all eyes are on Adlai Adlai
takes his seat his Staffers behind him They pass him up
papers and he spreads them before him taking no notice that
the entire room is staring at him

Adlai finally glances up Across the circle sits Zorin in
the flesh at the head of his own tough-looking DELEGATION
He acknowledges Adlai with a superior smile

ROMANIAN DELEGATE (CONTD)
We the people of Romania stand in
solidarity with the people of Cuba and

catches up with him His tone body language composure are
all that of complete confidence

ZORIN

Adlai nods returns to his notes as Zorin continues

ZORIN (CONTD)
For the last couple of hours I have
heard nothing but questions from the
world here The United States has led
us to the brink of calamity The
peoples of the world want to know why
We are told again and again of this so
called incontrovertible evidence of
offensive weapons in Cuba Yet we are
not allowed to see this evidence Are
your spy planes so secret you cannot
share this evidence with us Some
planes

The audience laughs Zorin basks in it And then grows
stern

ZORIN (CONTD)
Or perhaps there is no such evidence
Perhaps the United States is mistaken

meets Zorins icy bravura He notes the cameras around the
room This is the grandest stage of all

ZORIN (CONTD)
The chair recognizes the representative
from the United States

And in that moment Adlai becomes the spokesman for America

ADLAT
Well let me say something to you Mr
Ambassador we do have the evidence We
have it and it is clear and
incontrovertible

Adlais tone is definitive A tremor of interest passes
through the various delegations

ADLAI (CONTD)

danger not the United States

fashion in which a prosecutor puts
questions In due course sir you will
have your answer

Theres laughter at Zorins refusal to be bullied but its
nervous laughter not the polite stuff of diplomatic tete-a

you correctly

ploy blowing up in his face

Zorins smile is gone his smooth facade destroyed And he
looks like the biggest fool in the world

Adlai stares at the beet-faced man with disdain At last
Adlai stands gestures to the door to the hall behind him

The PHOTO INTERPRETERS come racing in with their briefing
boards

ADLAT
Well then ladies and gentlemen since
it appears we might be here for a while
shall we have a look at what the Soviets

INT SITUATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS

EXCOM celebrates Phones ring at several of the chairs at
the conference table The President and Kenny meet as Bundy
picks up a phone in the bg

THE PRESIDENT
Didnt know Adlai had it in him Too
bad he didnt have this stuff in 52

KENNY
Zorin must not have gotten instructions

Somebody in their Foreign Ministrys
blown it big-time
Bundy steps forward holding the phone

BUNDY

Kenny and the President turn to see what they already have
heard in those two words concern The room falls quiet

the ship is called Groznyy

EXT OCEAN PUERTO RICO TRENCH - CONTINUOUS

The Soviet Tanker Groznyy breasts the heavy seas Armed

We lost track of it yesterday at
nightfall We thought we gave it plenty
of room when we moved the quarantine
line back We just reacquired it

The CAMERA PANS to the left revealing a US DESTROYER
racing up alongside a few hundred yards away pounding up and
over the swells punching up a huge fan of spray from its
bow

MCNAMARA
It crossed the line hours ago

Admiral Anderson on the phone on the level below is tense

ADMIRAL ANDERSON
Hail them again

THE PRESIDENT (0S)
Keep us posted Bob

McNamara leans against the wall closes his eyes in
exhaustion and stress And when he opens the we PAN AROUND
TO REVEAL

A G-d-like view of the flag plot covered with HUNDREDS OF
SHIPS PLANES AND MARKINGS

McNamara stares out at the bewildering tangle of symbols
living men behind each one Each tangle of red and blue
symbols a powderkeg A G-dlike view indeed And it is far
more than any one mere man could keep control of And he
begins to realize it

MCNAMARA
Were kidding ourselves

And not only that in his bleary sleep-deprived fog he
begins to understand something happening down there
The CAMERA MOVES over the enormous map over the scrolling
cryptic numerology THE BUZZ of radio communications bleeds
in from the background The overhead platform swivels on its
motor like the vast arm of some fate-writing god as the
Watch Officer on it updates the movements of the ships

McNamara stares at the verge of grasping something Through
the door-crack of genius he has the glimpse of some grander
thing some grander design

ADMIRAL ANDERSON
Very well Load your guns

That starts McNamara from his fatigued reverie He goes to
the railing looks down on Anderson

MCNAMARA
What was that Admiral

Anderson turns gazes up from his tier below distracted

ADMIRAL ANDERSON
Weve been hailing the Groznyy for the
last hour Mr Secretary The Groznyy
refuses to stop

MCNAMARA
What are you doing

ADMIRAL ANDERSON
Carrying out our mission Mr Secretary
If you dont mind were very busy right
now We need to be able to do our jobs

MCNAMARA
Admiral I asked you a question

Anderson holds the phone aside turns around again looks up
at him impatient His answer is hard cold dangerous

ADMIRAL ANDERSON
Were going to follow the Rules of
Engagement The Rules of Engagement
which the President has approved and
signed in his order of October 23rd

Anderson listens again to the phone

ADMIRAL ANDERSON (CONTD)
Yes Captain you may proceed Clear
your guns

EXT OCEAN PUERTO RICO TRENCH - CONTINUOUS

BAMBAM ripping the air in front of the muzzles the Groznyy
so close a miss isnt possible

McNamara SHOUTS at Anderson dropping down the steps to
Andersons level

MCNAMARA
GODDAMNIT STOP THAT FIRING

Watch Officers scramble to comply chaos and shouting in the
war room as a chorus if Cease fire cease fire cease fire
goes up McNamara turns on Anderson is in his face

MCNAMARA (CONTD)
Jesus Christ God help us

Anderson smashes the phone down wheels on McNamara furious
EXT OCEAN PUERTO RICO TRENCH - CONTINUOUS

The Destroyers guns hammer away at the Groznyy at point
blank range but the Groznyy IS UNHARMED

Suddenly in the air above it appear BRILLIANT FLARES They
light up the ship brighter than the sun The destroyer
isnt firing deadly rounds its firing harmless
starshells

INT FLAG PLOT - THE PENTAGON - CONTINUOUS
Anderson gets in McNamaras face

ADMIRAL ANDERSON
That ship was firing starshells
Starshells Flares Mr Secretary

Everyones eyes are on the two men Only the chatter of
teletype breaks the paralyzing silence McNamara blinks
looks down at the plot on the floor Andersons voice drops
to a deadly sotto

ADMIRAL ANDERSON (CONTD)
Goddammitt Ive got a job to do
Youve been camped out up there since
Monday night Youre exhausted and
youre making mistakes Interfere with
me you will get some of killed I will
not allow that

McNamara looks away at the faces of the men in the room

MCNAMARA
Starshells

ADMIRAL ANDERSON

Get out of our way Mr Secretary The
navy has been running blockades since
the days of John Paul Jones

McNamara turns back And all trepidation embarrassment
hesitation are gone He coldly appraises Anderson

MCNAMARA
I believe the President made it clear
that there would be no firing on ships
without his express permission

ADMIRAL ANDERSON
With all due respect Mr Secretary we
were not firing on the ship Firing on
a ship means attacking the ship We
were not attacking the ship We were
firing over it

MCNAMARA
This was not the Presidents intention
when he gave that order What if the
Soviets dont see the distention What
if they make the same mistake I just
did

(beat)
There will be no firing anything near
ANY Soviet ships without my express
permission is that understood Admiral

ADMIRAL ANDERSON
Yes sir

MCNAMARA
And I will only issue such instructions
when ordered to by the President
(beat)
John Paul Jones you dont understand
a thing do you Admiral
He passes his hand over the enormous plot below

MCNAMARA (CONTD)
This isnt a blockade

McNamara trembling with anger awe whirls to Anderson And
his burgeoning insight is born - clear hard and cold

MCNAMARA (CONTD)
This all this is language a new
vocabulary the likes of which the world
has never seen
This is President Kennedy communicating
with Secretary Khruschev

McNamara JABS HIS FINGER OUT AT the plot and --

-- the CAMERA RACES DOWN TRACKING OVER IT across the vast
ebb and flow of information the delicate ballet of symbols
and numerology this language of steel and human life

the next encounter

Kenny who turns from the TV as the door to his office
opens Rusk walks in

RUSK
Kenny we need to see the President

Somethings happened

Kenny reacts to Rusks enigmatic expression And out from
behind Rusk steps JOHN SCALI the ABC News Correspondent

INT OVAL OFFICE - DAY
OFF THEIR REACTIONS the CAMERA FINDS an under-strength ad
hoc EXCOM - Kenny Bobby Taylor Bundy Sorensen McCone
Ball and the President Guarded hope all around The short
balding pugnacious Scali looks discomfited

SCALI
I have lunch with him maybe once a
month Way he talks he acts like he
knows Khruschev personally but hes
never elaborated Ive used him as a
source in a couple of stories

Kenny paces behind the gathered men around the Presidents
desk listening mind going a million miles an hour

RUSK
The FBI has identified this Alexander
Fomin as the Soviet Resident the KGB
equivalent of one of our station chiefs
Hes their highest ranking spy in this
country And he knows Johns a friend

of mine

BUNDY
All the trademarks of a back-channel
overture

Kenny eyes Bundy makes him uncomfortable The President
sizes Scali up

THE PRESIDENT
So theyll remove the missiles and
well pledge not to invade Cuba
destabilize Castro or assist anyone who
plans in doing so

Nobody dares speak Its as if the possibility of a
settlement will vanish into thin air if anyone moves

BOBBY
I think this may be our first real
message from Khruschev

MCCONE
The alternative Mr President is that
this could be a trap

KENNY
Dangle a settlement tie us down in
negotiations we come up short
MCCONE
Why else would they approach us in this
way Its deniable The Soviets have
done nothing but lie to us This could
be more of the same

KENNY
That may be why Khruschevs introducing
this guy Weve been burned by his
usual players in the formal channels so
he brings in an honest broker

MCCONE
That may be what they want us to think

RUSK
The truth is Mr President we dont
even really know whom Fomin speaks for
It could be Khruschev It could be some
faction in the Politburo or the KGB
itself We just dont know

BOBBY
By the way Scali your activities now
fall under the secrecy codicils of the
National Security Act Sorry no
Pulitzer

The gathered men chuckle only Scali a bit dour but being a
good sport about it Scali checks his watch

SCALI
Mr President we dont have much time
Im supposed to meet with him again in
three and a half hours

THE PRESIDENT
Well it seems the question of the day
is -- is the offer legitimate

He moves away from his desk The men watch him

THE PRESIDENT (CONTD)
If it is if it is then we cant
afford to ignore it
(beat to Scali)
John well have instructions for you in
a couple of hours

Scali nods Rusk escorts him out They wait until the door
closes Taylor looks over at McCone who nods
GENERAL TAYLOR
Mr President Im afraid we have some
bad news Were getting GMAIC estimates
from our latest low-level overflights
It appears the missiles are two to three
days away from operational status

MCCONE
So we dont have much time to play out
back-channel communiques

Kenny gives Bobby a hard look The President appears
unfazed

GENERAL TAYLOR
The quarantine sir is not producing
results The Chiefs feel its time you
take another look at our options

The President considers Taylor then looks over to Kenny

THE PRESIDENT
Kenny get over to your old stomping
grounds Go through everything the FBI
has on Fomin I need your best call is
this guy legit and is he speaking for
Khruschev And I need you to tell me by
the time I call you because right after
I call you Im calling Scali with his
instructions

paper-covered conference table WALTER SHERIDAN Kennys
investigator-buddy wears a visitors pass just like Kenny
Kenny and Walter RIFLE through the folders super fast super
proficient A half-dozen FBI AGENTS work around the table

SHERIDAN
Okay So what weve got is this guy
Alexander Feklisov aka Alexander Fomin
declared Consul to the Soviet Embassy
but in reality the KGB Papa Spy An
illustrious tour of duty during the
Great Patriotic War gets him on the
Party fast track various tours of duty
in KGB American postings Hes an
expert on us and thats all weve
got on Papa Spy

KENNY
Whos he talking for Is it Khruschev
or is this more bullshit

Kenny stands runs his hands through his hair aggravated

KENNY (CONTD)
How do you become the KGB top spy in the
United States

SHERIDAN
Gotta know someone

Kenny whirls on Sheridan A frozen beat

KENNY
Politics is politics Walter

(whirling on Agents)
hruschev is the Moscow Party Boss under
Stalin Give me their career
chronologies

Walter pushes a typed dateline of Khruschevs major career
moves and one of the Agents hands Kenny a list of Fomins
postings He lays them side by side And for every step of
Khruschevs theres a step for Fomin Not only that but
the DATES ARE IDENTICAL or nearly so

KENNY (CONTD)
Every time Khruschev moves up Fomin
does within a year

(tracing up the list)

Khruschev was the administrator in
charge of preparing Moscows defenses
during the war And Fomin was here
in the US

Kennys face falls But a YOUNG FBI AGENT cuts in

YOUNG FBI AGENT
Not at first

The Young FBI Agent proffers him a file Kenny snatches it

YOUNG FBI AGENT (CONTD)
He was an engineer stationed outside
Moscow in 42 Specialized in tank
traps

Kenny looks up at Walter Walter nods sagely lights a pipe

KENNY

Its thin But real life usually is

KENNY
Hello

Ive got to move What do you have
Kenny

INT STATLER HOTEL COFFEE SHOP - NIGHT

A few lonely BUSINESS TRAVELERS hang out in the dim coffee

shattering the silent triumph

shop Faint music plays Scali and ALEXANDER FOMIN sit with
steaming cups of coffee Scali nervous unfolds a note
Fomin an expressionless gray spectre of a man eyes him He

is in his boredom a spys spy

SCALI
I am instructed to tell you that the
American Government would respond
favorably to an offer along the lines
you have discussed If this solution
were raised at the UN by Ambassador
Zorin he would find a favorable reply
from Ambassador Stevenson

FOMIN
So I understand you correctly If the
missiles in Cuba were dismantled
Scali demurs

Scali takes a sip of coffee

returned to the Soviet Union and a
guarantee was made not to reintroduce
them the United States would be
prepared to guarantee that it would
never invade Cuba

SCALI
That is correct

FOMIN
This is from the Highest Authority

SCALI
Yes From the Highest Authority There
are two conditions The UN
must be allowed to inspect the removal
of the missiles

FOMIN
And of course the UN must be allowed
to observe the redeployment of forces
from the American Southeast

FOMIN (CONTD)
And the second condition

SCALI
Time is of the essence

FOMIN

INT CABINET ROOM - NIGHT

Kenny slams a page of Khruschevs letter on the table He
jabs his finger at it EXCOM listens intent

KENNY
Its ten pages of sentimental fluff but
hes saying right here Hell remove
the missiles in return for a no-invasion
pledge It looks like Fomins overture
was genuine

The President turns to McCone

MCCONE
Our early analysis says this was
probably written by Khruschev himself
Its a first draft and shows no signs
of being polished by the foreign
ministry In fact it probably hasnt
been approved by the Politburo They
wouldnt have let the emotionalism go
by The analysts say it was written by
someone under considerable stress

EXCOM chuckles

THE PRESIDENT
Glad to hear were not alone

The President eyes the EXCOM members one by one an incipient
smile on his face

THE PRESIDENT (CONTD)
Well gentlemen I wasnt planning on
invading Cuba anyway I think we can
live with the terms of this deal

There are mostly nods of assent big smiles around the table
Except from McCone and Taylor The President takes his copy
of the letter flips through it He shakes his head almost
unable to believe that Khruschev has given in A long beat

THE PRESIDENT (CONTD)
Ted want you to draft our acceptance

EXT ODONNELL DRIVEWAY - NIGHT

A long black car stops at the end of Kennys driveway The
door opens and Kenny steps out He says an inaudible
goodnight to the driver and the car pulls off He turns
facing the white two-story house with the neat front yard
the lights out And he smiles Home at last

EXT ODONNELL PATIO - NIGHT

A screen door squeaks open Kenny steps out into the
darkness of the back yard And there in her robe sitting
startled on a lawn chair lit only by the dim glow of the
kitchen window is Helen Kenny stands there tired his coat
slung over his shoulder

KENNY
Hi

Helen rises her own care-worn face turned to his Fora
silent moment they gaze at each other searching in the lines
of each others face for the changes of a long separation
They see them But theyve been married a long time and the
awkwardness passes

HELEN
Hi ODonnell You look old

Kenny drops his coat on a table as Helen comes up and folds
herself into his arms

HELEN (CONTD)
This jobs going to kill you If I
dont first

They kiss comfortable But not too long and he lets her
go She looks at him again sees hes suppressing a smile

HELEN (CONTD)
If youre home it means either Jack and
Bobby have finally figured out what a
con man you are and fired you or --

KENNY
-- we got a back channel communication
from Khruschev this evening feeling us
out about a deal He confirmed it just
a little while ago in a letter to the
President I think weve won

HELEN
A thing like this who could even
think of winning

SUPER SATURDAY OCTOBER 27TH DAY 12

Kenny in his overcoat steps aside as a pair of Duty

Officers race past him almost bowling him over

He slows as he nears the doors to his office and the Oval

Office DISCOVERING

TOTAL CHAOS EXCOM guys Assistants dart to and from the
offices and halls On all their faces grim expressions
Kenny stands there a beat in confusion And then Bobby
swings out of Kennys office Theres a desperate edge to

Bobbys voice

BOBBY
Whereve you been Weve been trying to
find you all morning

KENNY
Helen and I went out for breakfast
EXCOMs not supposed to convene til
eight

BOBBY
We just got a second letter from
Khruschev The deals off

INT HALL OUTSIDE CABINET ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Kenny and Bobby walk fast for the cabinet room
in his coat

BOBBY
Were getting everyone together as fast
as we can

KENNY
What does the letter say

Kenny still
BOBBY
They want us to take our missiles out of
Turkey along with the no invasion
pledge It looks like Fomin was a ploy
after all and they were just stalling
for time

Kenny is stunned

BOBBY (CONTD)
It gets worse

Kenny gives Bobby a sharp look as they enter --
INT CABINET ROOM - CONTINUOUS

The President in shirtsleeves no tie glances up at Kenny
as he and Bobby enter Kenny can only bear his look for a
second he blew the call on Fomin But the President is
clearly relieved to see him gives him a faint smile

Half of EXCOM including McNamara McCone Rusk and Taylor
barely notice them as theyre already there arguing

Kenny sits down hurriedly shucks off his coat as he joins
the conversation in mid-stream

MCCONE

My specialists are in agreement this
mornings letter is not Khruschev Last
nights letter was

(beat)
The evidence supports only one
conclusion there has been a coup and
Khruschev was replaced overnight

KENNY
Jesus Christ

Bobby gives him a look told you things got worse

THE PRESIDENT
Dean

RUSK
It doesnt necessarily mean theres been
a coup Khruschevs name is signed to
the letter

MCNAMARA
Aw come on Dean
RUSK

But at the very least It does suggest
hes been co-opted by hard line
elements

MCNAMARA

Which at the end of the day is the same
thing as a coup A puppet Khruschev
and a hard-line Soviet government
pulling the strings No deal And the
missiles are almost operational

Bitter silence They all look to the President Imminent
victory has turned to ashes The President studies his own
folded hands Ball and Thompson enter take seats One by
one throughout the scene other EXCOM members join the
group

THE PRESIDENT
You know the problem we have is that
this is latest offer of theirs will seem
reasonable to everyone We remove our
missiles they remove theirs
Our Jupiters were scheduled for removal
anyway Theyre obsolete after all

Kenny shakes his head in mute anger McNamara and Rusk seem
to sense the Presidents feelings too

RUSK

Mr President agreeing to such a trade
would be tantamount to paying ransom
Theyll put a gun to our head again and
expect us to pay again

Kenny looks the President in the eye

KENNY
We cant sell out one of our friends for
our own safety NATO wouldnt trust us
anymore and theyd be right not to

The President sighs in the face of the stern advice He
nods expecting as much Bobby still cant look at anyone

THE PRESIDENT
So which one of you geniuses can tell me
how to explain ourselves to the world
How do we work with them if theres been
a hard-line coup

GENERAL TAYLOR
Mr President there is another
possibility we havent considered This
may not be a coup at all

Everyone of Kennys instincts jumps His head snaps up to
listen to Taylor Taylor pauses

GENERAL TAYLOR (CONTD)
Its possible that the back-channel
overture last nights letter and this
letter today along with everything the
Soviets have said all along is nothing
more than a lie -- disinformation

MCNAMARA
Designed to keep us from taking action

Kenny hears the fatalism in McNamaras voice A long beat
Everyone stares at McNamara

MCNAMARA (CONTD)
I hate to say it but if I had to bet
Id bet Max is right What if they have
no intention of honoring this deal
either
Then tomorrow they add another
condition Meanwhile the quarantine
isnt working and theyre continuing to
work on the missile sites

(beat)

I think we have to consider issuing
warning orders for our forces

They were so close last night and suddenly Lundahl and
LeMay enter the room with the days briefing boards

LUNDAHL
Mr President

Lundahl stands there at the end of the table gray He
almost cant say it cant look the President in the face

The news hits the room like a thunderbolt Kenny looks to
Bobby and the President The blood is gone from their faces

MCNAMARA
Then were out of time We have to go
in

LUNDAHL

That may not be as easy as we thought
either Weve gotten confirmation that
the Soviets have also deployed
battlefield nuclear weapons to Cuba

A pall falls over the room as LeMay explains

LEMAY
FROGS we call em Short range
tactical nukes Its possible theyve

delegated release authority to their
local commanders for use against our
invasion troops Itd be standard
doctrine

(beat)
Our capability to get all the missiles
has eroded during our delay with the
quarantine The good news is that for
the moment we know where the FROGS are
and we can target them too But the
longer we wait the hard its going to
get
They all look to the President Kenny stares in a private
hell blacker and more complete than anyone should ever know

In that shocked silence each man grapples with failure The
Best and the Brightest could not prevent what must come next

THE PRESIDENT

Then we have no choice

(to Taylor)
General issue the warning orders to our
forces They will be prepared to
execute the air strikes Monday morning
and the follow-on invasion according to
the schedule thereafter Ill need the
official release orders on my desk
Sunday night

GENERAL TAYLOR
Understood sir We need to step up the
overflights finalize our pilots target
folders in order to be able to carry out
the strikes

The President gives Kenny a meaningful look

THE PRESIDENT
Permission granted

Taylor exits Kenny rises gives the President an almost
imperceptible nod as he prepares to leave in Taylors wake

browbeating pilots navy guys left and

avoid going to war Dont get shot

you realize that theres a kind of
peace You dont need to be in control
You never were in control in the first
place If youre a good man and your

can ask for And with the grace of G-d
itll get you through

A silver glint appears in the center of the horizon It
grows larger Then larger still It is the U-2 We barely
have time to register the rising hiss of its engines when it
FILLS THE SCREEN and BOOMS PAST leaving us standing still

spool down He stares out the window The towering clouds
below rise up magnificent glorious a glimpse of heaven
Rapt Anderson stares And then suddenly a BLARING ALARM
GOES OFF IN THE COCKPIT It shocks Anderson around to the

too small to be seen with the naked eye

INT U-2 - CONTINUOUS

The cockpit is a cacophony of alarms and lights the horizon
outside tilted Andersons breath comes fast rasping as he
does his strains going into the high-g turn

He looks out the cockpit window finds the first SA-2 missile
in pursuit only several thousand feet below him now He
waits Waits Waits still in the turn The black head of
the missile now visible

He puts the plane over rolling out into an opposite bank
EXT U-2 - CONTINUOUS

The spy planes long flimsy wings werent made for
dogfighting They BEND terribly in the rollout And then
the first missile STREAKS past tries to correct its miss
but cant and vanishes into the distance at a 90-degree
angle

INT U-2 - CONTINUOUS

Andersons breath comes faster and faster as the second
missile rises up now visible He puts the throttle as far
as it goes trying to outrun death Every second is a tenth
of a mile and every mile shortens the missiles life span

The rising missile drafts aft closing on the U-2 from
behind

EXT U-2 - CONTINUOUS

The second missiles contrail rises up behind the plane
levels off and closes on it at a tremendous rate
The third missile rises up in the far distance behind the
second

The second missile races up on the U-2 closer right behind
it cant miss Then at a hundred yards the contrail
suddenly peters out and the missile out of fuel drops
away

But the third missile closes
INT U-2 - CONTINUOUS

Anderson glances out the window sees the spent missiles fall
away and spots the third missile still seeking him aft

Hand pinning the throttle forward he prays under his breath
EXT U-2 - CONTINUOUS

The third SA-2 rides its billowing column of exhaust straight
for the tail of the U-2 This one is not out of fuel

INT U-2 - CONTINUOUS

Major Anderson opens his eyes He stares out the window at
the glorious wonder of cloud and sea and earth below

EXT U-2 - CONTINUOUS

And the missile looms We have time to realize its almost
as big as the plane itself before it SHEARS right into the U
2s tail and EXPLODES in a BLINDING FLASH

INT HALL OUTSIDE BUNDYS OFFICE - DAY
Kenny jogging down the hall hears form an open door

BUNDY (0S)
Kenny

Kenny goes over to the threshold Inside the office Bundy
stands up from behind his desk grave And Kenny knows

INT CABINET ROOM - DAY

All of EXCOM is there except for Bundy Kenny sits behind
the President deeply distraught over Major Anderson

THE PRESIDENT
Does this attack on our plane represent
a definitive intentional escalation on
the part of the Soviets
GENERAL TAYLOR
The Soviets are in control of the SAMs
Its hard to believe with their
centralized command structure that it
could be an accidental launch

MCCONE
Mr President taken with the events of
the past few hours I believe this
confirms our worst fears Were now
dealing with a hard-line Soviet
government perhaps with Khruschev as a
puppet head perhaps not

In the silence Kenny reads the faces around the room
Theyre convinced by McCones pronouncement Kennys not

KENNY
It could be a mistake

McCone gives him a get-serious look But Kenny presses on

KENNY (CONTD)
We need to be positive before we react

Bundy enters the room Everyone looks up He stands there
in the doorway his face tight

Kenny sags in his chair Bundy of course has more bad
news and they all know it A hopeless beat The President
just stares at Bundy unable to ask Bundy nods affirming
what everyone is thinking

BUNDY
A U-2 on a routine air-sampling mission
over Siberia got lost and penetrated
Soviet airspace The Soviets scrambled
MIGs in pursuit thinking it was a
bomber It got out okay Somebody
forgot to cancel the mission

THE PRESIDENT
Goddammitt Theres always some
sonofabitch who doesnt get the word
All we need is the Soviets thinking
were bombing them
(facetious)
Anybody else

The humor falls on a cold audience

GENERAL TAYLOR
Mr President our pilots are in danger
We must order punitive airstrikes
against the SAM site that shot down
Major Anderson per our rules of
engagement

And finally the moment Kenny has dreaded all this time has
come to pass He looks at Bobby then at the President The
President stares at the cup of coffee in his hands as if
trying to read the Fates design in it A long beat and
everyone holds their breath

THE PRESIDENT
No I want confirmation there wasnt
some sort of accident first

LeMay clears his throat Everyone looks at him expecting
him to scream or jump up and down

LEMAY
I think thats a good idea Mr
President Itll be safer for my boys
to get those SAMs on Monday when we get
the rest of the bastards I can wait a
day and a half

THE PRESIDENT
Very well then

But he says it without any belief in the words realizing
theyre being tied fast to the train tracks of war

INT KENNYS OFFICE - DAY

Alone in his office shattered Kenny stares out the window
viewing the distant Ellipse through a gap in the trees Kids
are out there playing football He glances at his watch and
grabs his jacket

EXT WHITE HOUSE - DAY

Kenny puts on his jacket as he goes down the steps into the
bright autumn day walking away from the White House It
drops behind him -- his step is faster more urgent

EXT STREET - DAY

Kenny walks down the sidewalk drawn toward the Ellipse The
sixth grade FOOTBALL PLAYERS sweep forward with a running
play Kenny scans them searching his breath coming hard

EXT ELLIPSE - DAY
He reaches the edge of the open field And then he spots the
name on the jersey ODonnell Its Kevin The players
relinquish the ball and the offense comes off the field
Kevin sees his dad

KEVIN
Hey Dad
Kenny manages a smile as Kevin trots over Kevin pulls his
helmet off They stand there a long beat Kenny desperate to
take him up abandon his post but he doesnt

KENNY
Hey sport You winning

KEVIN
Yeah

But Kevin sees the turmoil in his fathers face

KEVIN (CONTD)
Is everything going to be okay Dad

Kennys forced smile is answer enough

KENNY
Yeah Kev Everythings gonna be fine

But Kevin knows Together they know The end of the world
is at hand

KEVIN
I guess you wont be coming home
tonight

KENNY
I uh

Suddenly a car HONKS Kenny turns around Bobby is leaning
out the rear passenger window of his limo And he sees what
Kenny is doing He doesnt want to cut in but has to

BOBBY
Kenny We need to talk

Kenny looks back at his son

KENNY
Get back out there kid Remember to
hit em hard
KEVIN
What about you Where are you going

KENNY
Back to work

Kevin puts his helmet back on his head Kenny watches as
Kevin jogs off to rejoin his team Kenny turns his back on
his son and strides for Bobbys limo dying inside

EXT SANS SOUCI PARKING LOT - DAY

Kenny and Bobby stand by their car off to one side of the
restaurants parking lot Bobbys Secret Service Agents
maintain a discreet distance

KENNY
If were going to make a deal were
going to have to do it fast This is
only getting out of control The only
reason were not at war this very minute
is hes been able to stretch bend and
break his own rules He wont be able
to keep it up forever

Bobby jams the last bit of sandwich in his mouth A beat
Kenny looks him in the eye

BOBBY
And

KENNY
And Jack wants to trade the missiles in
Turkey

BOBBY

The Jupiters are obsolete They were
supposed to have been dismantled last
summer anyway --

KENNY
-- Jesus Mary and Joseph I told you
how stupid it was to float the Lippman
article But you wouldnt listen to me
What if there hasnt been a coup at all
What if its you two who invited that
second letter by raising the possibility
of a trade

Bobby is speechless with rage

KENNY (CONTD)
And if the two of you are thinking this
trade is your ace in the hole youre so
wrong Its a deuce

Bobbys beyond furious They catch their rising voices

KENNY (CONTD)

And its not just me who thinks that
Everyone on this so-called EXCOM is
telling you exactly the same thing make
the trade and theyre going to force us
into trade after trade until finally
they demand something we wont trade
like Berlin and we do end up in a war

(beat)
Not to mention that long before that
happens this government will be
politically dead

Bobby simmers for a long beat thinking And boy does this
guy hate admitting hes wrong

BOBBY
All right so maybe we overestimated how
reasonable this trade would look Okay
You happy So now what

KENNY
So now youve got to talk him out of it
And then weve got to figure out an
acceptable political solution

BOBBY
And if there has been a coup and there
is no acceptable political solution

Kenny stares off at the city agonized
INT OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT

Kenny enters from his office finding Bobby Rusk and
Sorensen talking with the President The President gives him
a brief meaningful look

RUSK
Whatever response we send it will take
several hours for the wire to be
received by our embassy and delivered to
the Kremlin So were looking at early
tomorrow morning at the earliest before
Khruschev could respond
As Rusk talks Kenny passes close by Bobby Bobby whispers

BOBBY
He gets it but hes pissed

THE PRESIDENT
Thats all well and good but what do we
say to em

SORENSEN
It depends on if we really believe
theres been a coup

That strikes a cord with Kenny

KENNY
I agree If there has been a coup and
theres a hard-line government in power
now then it doesnt matter what we say
The end of the day well either agree to
their terms theyll agree to ours or
well go to war But what if there
hasnt been a coup What if what if
what is happening is a series of
accidents

SORENSEN
The second letter is an accident

KENNY
No The letter is an intentional but
its having an effect far greater than
its authors intended
(beat)
What if our Jupiter missiles are just a
last minute haggle to salvage something
Maybe a bone Khruschev is throwing to
the hard line not really caring if we
reject it or not
(beat)
And then these accidents have happened

BOBBY
Making the second letter and the overall
picture look worse than it really is

SORENSEN
The Guns of August

KENNY
Exactly
(beat)
If theyre sane and human like we are
then maybe we just refuse and theyll
let it slide like weve been letting
things slide

SORENSEN
So we reject the second letter

And Kenny looks at Bobby The world stops

KENNY
No We dont reject it

It hits Bobby like a lightning bolt

BOBBY
We accept the first letter and
pretend the second doesnt exist

The President Rusk and Sorensen stare at him mute
INT CABINET ROOM - NIGHT

HOLD ON the exact same mute reaction from the entire
assembled EXCOM Finally McCone breaks the spell

MCCONE
It wont work --

Bobby Kenny and Sorensen start to object but McCone raises
his voice over theirs

MCCONE (CONTD)
-- because its wishful thinking Its
the same wishful thinking that blinded
us all these months while the Soviets
were sneaking those missiles in under
our noses

McNamara shakes his head intrigued but skeptical

MCNAMARA
Ignore the second letter agree to the
conditions of the first

GENERAL TAYLOR
Theres no reason to believe the Soviets
will let it go

RUSK
Max is right Why will they accept it
MCNAMARA
It can work If IF they believe well
hit them

Kenny Bobby and Sorensen look at McNamara grateful

MCNAMARA (CONTD)
Weve only got time for one more round
of diplomacy The first airstrikes
start in less than 36 hours

RUSK
But we have to make them agree to it
So how do we do that

The President leans forward Sensing hes about to speak
all eyes turn to him

THE PRESIDENT
We give them something We tell them
well remove the missiles from Turkey
say six months from now so that there
appears to be no linkage We also tell
them if they go public about it we deny
it and the deal is off

KENNY
And we do it under the table so we can
disavow any knowledge of it

MCCONE
Its transparent The pressll be all
over it

KENNY

Six months from now Im not going to
care Are you Well deal with it

MCNAMARA
At least it will expose whether
Khruschev has been overthrown Well
know what were dealing with

KENNY
And if this is a move to appease the
hard line then it may just be the bone
he needs to regain control of his own
house

Most EXCOM is nodding agreeing McCone shakes his head in
disgust Taylor sits in silence
RUSK
Whoever carries the message has to hit
the nail on the head Come across as
too soft theyll push us Too hard
theyll be cornered and even more
dangerous

MCCONE
They could pre-empt

Its a terrible responsibility to bear The room is silent
At last Bobby looks up from his folded hands to his brother
The President stares back There is nobody else who can do
this Only Bobby His brother

THE PRESIDENT
Bobby You know Dobrynin best

Bobby nods taking up the gauntlet

THE PRESIDENT (CONTD)
Ted you get working on the draft

Sorensen and Bobby rise as one head for the doors

THE PRESIDENT (CONTD)
And make sure he knows we have to have
an answer tomorrow
(beat final)
Because on Monday we begin military
action against Cuba

Bobby and Kenny exchange a look
EXT WEST WING DRIVEWAY - NIGHT

A LONG SHOT Bobby emerges from the West Wing in his
overcoat briefcase in hand He pauses tiny alone The
West Wing - and all its imposing spotlit power behind him -
reduced to this insignificant man on his eleventh-hour
mission

And then out of the shadows in the fg steps Kenny in his
own coat his breath frosting in the late-night air Bobby
sees him and knows he is not so alone anymore

ON THE DRIVEWAY

They meet in front of the limo Bobby stops shuffles his
things awkward

BOBBY
What do you want A good-bye kiss

Kenny opens the drivers side door The Secret Service LIMO
DRIVER peers out

LIMO DRIVER
Hey Kenny

KENNY
Hey Joe Listen Ill take care of
him Go ahead in grab some coffee
Well be back pretty quick

LIMO DRIVER
You sure

Kennys nod and look -- theres no arguing The Limo Driver
hops out and Kenny gets in Bobby stands there outside for
a beat He tries to hide how touched he is but cant
completely

KENNY
Whats the matter with you Forget how
to open a car door

INT BOBBYS LIMO - NIGHT

Bobby recovers opens his own door gets in the front seat
next to Kenny

KENNY
Jesus you rich people

Kenny starts up the engine Bobby smiles a twisted smile
As the car pulls away the two men sit in silence neither
willing to admit how glad the other is there

EXT PENNSYLVANIA AVE - NIGHT

The limo wheels out into the street carrying the two friends
into the darkness

INT BOBBYS LIMO - NIGHT

Bobby stares out the window at the passing city the lights
the lives behind those windows As the car drives on and on
the tension returns Bobby feels the weight of all those
lives On him A long beat He gazes at Kenny the only
man he could ever admit this to

BOBBY
I dont know if I can do this
Kenny glances over at him Bobby stares back

KENNY
Theres nobody else Id rather have
going in there

Bobby looks at him

KENNY (CONTD)
Nobody else Id trust Helen and the
kids lives to

Kenny means it He looks away Bobby shifts awkward

BOBBY
Take a left

Kenny looks him This isnt the way to the Justice
Department But he complies

BOBBY (CONTD)
We gave so much to get here I dont
know Sometimes I think what the hell
did we do it for

KENNY
Because we knew we could do a better job
than everyone else

And Bobby in the silence and closeness of the car turns on
Kenny - anguished knowing his life is at its climax

BOBBY
You know I hate being called the
brilliant one The ruthless one They
guy who does the dirty work The one
everybodys afraid of

Kenny looks to him moved not knowing what to say

BOBBY (CONTD)
I hate it Im not smart you know
And Im not so ruthless

He looks to Kenny searching his face then away
embarrassed

KENNY
Youre right about the smart part but
ruthless well
That breaks the tension as they arrive at the scene
THROUGH THE WINDOW

Appears the grim square lines of the SOVIET EMBASSY Police
cars line the streets outside it All the windows are dark
A cordon of KGB GUARDS in plainclothes stand by the gated
entrance On the opposite side of the street lounge two
dozen WASHINGTON DC POLICE

THE CAMERA lifts away from the limo turning toward the
Embassy past the Guards past the brass plate which reads
EMBASSY OF THE UNITED SOVIET SOCIALIST REPUBLICS up and up
to the roof where black reeking SMOKE billows from all of
the Embassys several chimneys

The CAMERA races into it It engulfs us all

EXT JUSTICE DEPARTMENT - NIGHT

Kenny squeals the limo up to the curb in front of the Justice
Department The doors fly open and Kenny and Bobby jump
out head up the steps to the building

INT HALL OUTSIDE BOBBYS OFFICE - NIGHT

Bobbys STAFFERS greet them as they stride down the hall
Staffer 1 taking Bobbys coat
STAFFER 1
Sir Ambassador Dobrynin is already
here We have him waiting in your
office

They reach the double oak doors to Bobbys suite and stop
Bobby faces Kenny

KENNY
Ill whistle up some luck for you

And before Kennys eyes all of Bobbys doubt vanishes In
its place a severe confidence A grandeur Kenny has never
seen

It makes Kenny pause He beholds his best friend become a
man of the ages And then Bobby SMOOTHLY opens the door

INT BOBBYS WAITING ROOM - NIGHT

And a DOOR SHUTS OC like a threshold of history HOLD ON
Bobbys waiting room Silent Cavernous Dim Plush
carpet Heavy drapes framing dark windows And abandoned
secretarys desk A row of sofas and chairs on either side
of the room Two doorways one at either end of the room

A WOMAN sits in one of the chairs for visitors Dressed in
gray Prim But beautiful A secretary of some sort

One of the double doors to the hall swings silently open
enny glides in He sees the other door shut at the far end
of the room Kenny crashes in one of the chairs to wait

HOLD ON THE SCENE motionless silent

enny WHISTLES two notes Stops And then he begins to
WHISTLE the Irish tune ODonnell Aboo He gets a bar into
it -- and theres a polite soft COUGH

enny stops Then notices the Woman in gray across the room
He didnt see her Its dim over there She looks at him
expressionless

The CAMERA FINDS a pin on her lapel A RED HAMMER AND
SICKLE

Kenny reacts Dobrynins assistant His opposite number A
friend Or more than a friend

Here is the face of the enemy Not a smile between them
Kenny resumes his ease And begins to WHISTLE again
The haunting Irish song echoes in the vaulted ceiling
filling the dim room Strange sad beautiful The woman
listens And her face begins to soften

enny stares at the dark lonely windows his SONG striving
to fill the empty room

enny sinks deeper in the chair his tune all-consuming
and the Womans voice breaks in Kenny stops looks over
Her voice is tremulous and beautiful Just a snatch of some
song in Russian She stops awkward

enny stares The Woman stares back No smiles But in
their eyes they each see the others fear the others
beauty the others humanity

So this is the enemy

THE WOMAN
Who are you

Kenny glances to the door He considers for a long moment

KENNY
The friend

Kenny breaks the gaze He begins to whistle again The
CAMERA drifts away finding the far DOOR to the inner office
Kennys tune stronger carrying with it hope

INT BOBBYS OFFICE - NIGHT

to the other side of that DOOR Dobrynin sits in a chair
opposite Bobby behind his desk The room is equally dim
And far more tense

Silence And then the FAINTEST STRAIN of ODonnell Aboo
Dobrynin glances briefly over his shoulder at the door

But Bobby unseen by Dobrynin cant help the flicker of a
private smile Its Kennys presence and Bobby is the
stronger for it And then the tune is gone

Bobby leans forward cool controlled masterful

BOBBY
Ambassador Dobrynin we are aware that
at this moment your missiles in Cuba are
at the brink of operational readiness

SMASH CUT TO
EXT MISSILE SITE - CUBA - CONTINUOUS

Floodlights illuminate MISSILES vertical on their erectors
support VEHICLES clustered across the man-made clearing

Mask-wearing Technicians wave a FUEL TRUCK back to the
nearest missile Clouds of toxic VAPOR rise from the others
Theyve already been fueled

BOBBY (VO)
They are a vital threat to my country
If launched they would kill 80 million
Americans

SMASH CUT TO
INT BOBBYS OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
Dobrynin listens impassively as is his professional duty

BOBBY
My brother my friends my countrymen
and I cannot and will not permit those
missiles to become operational
(beat)
I promise you that

Dobrynin looks out the window And then pained looks back
at Bobby

DOBRYNIN
Then fear our two nations will go to
war And I fear where war will lead us

Bobby acknowledges him with a nod

BOBBY

If the missiles do not become
operational if you remove the missiles
then there will be no war

(beat)
At this moment the President is
accepting the terms of Secretary
Khruschevs letter of Friday night If
the Soviet Union halts construction
immediately removes the missiles and
submits to UN inspection the United
States will pledge to never invade Cuba
or aid others in that enterprise

Dobrynin stares at Bobby Stares hard
DOBRYNIN
If your Jupiter missiles in Turkey were
removed also such an accommodation
could be reached

The two men move their argument forward with the deliberation
and formality of chess masters

BOBBY
(tired sounding)
The United States cannot agree to such
terms under threat Any belief to the
contrary --
(beat)
-- was in error

Dobrynin reels internally The only sign on his face is a
slight tremor Bobby looks up registers the calculated
effect And to Dobrynins horror the Russian believes

DOBRYNIN
You want war

But not so fast Bobby folds his hands And he smoothly
goes from hard-ass brinksman to sensitive deal-maker

BOBBY
However while there can be no quid pro
quo on this issue the United States can
offer a private assurance

Dobrynin holds his breath

BOBBY (CONTD)
Our Jupiter missiles in Turkey are
obsolete and have been scheduled for
withdrawal for some time This
withdrawal should be completed within
say six months

Dobrynin lets out his breath

BOBBY (CONTD)
Of course any public disclosure of this
assurance would negate the deal and
produce the most stringent denials from
our government

Dobrynin grasps the move immediately understanding the
ramifications Still he hesitates a moment

DOBRYNIN
This private assurance represents the

word of the Highest Authority

BOBBY
Yes

DOBRYNIN
And it can be relayed beyond Comrade

Khruschevs ears to the top circles of

my government

BOBBY

Of course Our pledge can be relayed to

any government official Secretary
Khruschev sees fit to satisfy

Meaning this is the bone he can show the hard line Dobrynin

struggles internally knowing what Bobby has
hug him It comes across as agitation

BOBBY (CONTD)
With the caveat that it is not made
public in any way shape or form
(beat)

And we must have an answer tomorrow at

done wanting to

the latest I cannot stress this point

enough

DOBRYNIN
Tomorrow

BOBBY
Tomorrow

Dobrynin rises from his chair Bobby rises with him

DOBRYNIN
Then you must excuse me and permit me
relay the substance of our discussion
my superiors

Dobrynin heads for the door Half way there
Bobby deeply moved Deeply grateful

DOBRYNIN (CONTD)
We have heard stories that some among
your military men wish for war
(beat)

You are a good man Your brother is a

he turns back to

good men Let us hope the will of good

men is enough to counter the terrible
strength of this thing which has been
put in motion

INT OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT

Kenny enters the Oval Office through his side door The
office is dark only the desk lamp on Kennys gaze moves
over the trappings of power the carpet with the Presidential
Seal the rocking chair by the fireplace the desk

And on the desk tucked almost out of sight sits a small
humble wooden plaque Its turned to face the occupant of
the chair behind the desk Kenny reaches out turns it
around It is the Bretons Fishermans Prayer

It reads OH LORD THY SEA IS GREAT MY BOAT SO SMALL

Kenny holds on the plaque a beat and looks up at the open
French door to the Rose Garden The curtains swirl around
him in the wind as he goes through the door and out --

EXT PORTICO - CONTINUOUS

-- onto the portico Standing there in the dark by the
white neoclassical pillars of the cloister are Bobby and the
President Theyre holding drinks Kenny joins them

The President gestures out across the South Lawn to the
gleaming Washington Monument

THE PRESIDENT
We were just debating who had it worse
us or George Washington and his guys

BOBBY
He didnt have to worry about nuclear
weapons

THE PRESIDENT
Yeah but the country didnt even exist
as a country yet It was a mess and he
didnt have a leg to stand on

KENNY
All he had was his character

The President and Bobby nod at the justice of that remark

BOBBY
How does a guy get a rep like that

THE PRESIDENT
Doesnt matter to me If I went down in
history like Adams Id die happy All
they say about him today is --

KENNY
-- he kept the peace

Kenny looks at the President The President feels it and
gazes back to him

The three of them stare out at the glittering city The
grandness of the world lies before them and they are
deciding its fate and are humbled by the awfulness of it
The silence is beyond power

And for a long moment they know not to disturb it There is
nothing left to say The President at last finishes his
drink

You know we never did control it Not
really Not like we think

He looks at Kenny Kenny nods He knows that now too

him hes desperately needed But it doesnt

I regard with respect and trust the
statement you made in your message of 27
October 1962 that there would be no
attack no invasion of Cuba and not
only the part of the United States but
also on the part of the Western
Hemisphere as you said in your same
message Then the motives which induced
us to render assistance of such a kind
to Cuba disappear

Kennedy greeting well-wishers a brilliant smile on his
face is carried through the crowd toward Kenny and the doors
of the church

Kenny watches them heads bowed in discussion disappear into
the labyrinth of the West Wing Kenny turns his back on
them

INT PRESIDENTS BEDROOM - DAY

The President stands at his mirror tying a bow tie to a tux
for some Sunday special event Kenny gathers up his folder
from nearby breakfast table

Kenny meets the Presidents gaze in the mirror and the two
men know they have been to the same mountaintop

THE PRESIDENT

A beat Kenny stands straight ready for action ready for
some necessary thing Ready to go back into the game

THE PRESIDENT (CONTD)

Kenny starts to leave but at the door turns back

KENNY
You know

The President looks at him in the mirror

KENNY (CONTD)

The President smiles an ever-so-faint smile Kenny turns and
leaves the room vanishing and as we HOLD on the empty
doorway the simple whistled melody of ODONNELL ABOO drifts
from the hallway beyond becoming our END MUSIC
