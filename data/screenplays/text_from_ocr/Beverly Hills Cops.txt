The Hummer circles a giant water fountain A culdesac leads
them to the front of the home Out steps --

Eddie Stone and two more men From the front seat steps DIEGO

From the back steps his partner HAL BENSON (40s) aged world

are both reluctant to follow Stones lead

Harry Benson and Diego hover over the balcony rail stare down
at a hopping pool party with several twenty-somethings young
men and women swimming sunbathing drinking

HARRY
They were street urchins when I
found them Lost angry souls

live for Disposed of by society
You find someone like this Feed
them Cloth them Give them
shelter Provide them with means
beyond their wildest imagination
Along with a steady supply of
whatever poison theyre polluting
their bodies withand they
become loyal as lapdogs

Diego observes the crowd - unimpressed
DIEGO

I dont know They dont look
so dangerous to me
Harry smiles

Come I have something to show
you

Harry leads the men back inside - as they pass a heated game of
pool between two hot bikinis one of which is smoking meth from
a glass pipe

About a dozen of Harrys strays are firing pistols and automatic
weapons at paper targets Young men and women

Harry walks Diego and Benson down the line

HARRY
As you can see its not all fun
and games Theres a small price
to pay for sitting in the lap of
luxury I keep my soldiers sharp
All highly trained highly skilled
in whatever mission I see fit

Benson peeks through some venetian blinds at a whole couch full
of YOUNG WOMEN in thousand dollar gowns lined up in a row

taking turns going down on one of Harrys goons A special kind
of training

Harry leads the two men onto an outside deck with a full bar and
a stone fire pit leather chairs swank couches

He pours the men a shot of scotch

HARRY (CONTD)
Im building an empire Soldiers
loyal to me Ready to carry out
my vision To follow orders
without question

He hands Benson and Diego their drinks as the partners share a
quick look

HARRY (CONTD)
Tell me where you can find that
kind of loyalty in your police
department
HARRY (CONTD)
Thats where you gentlemen come in
As I said Ive been spoiling them
far too much The problem with
kidsyou spoil themthey get
greedy And they get sloppy Go
into business for themselves And
then they get caught I cant have
my name mentioned every time one of
my people get busted slinging dime
bags to school kids

BENSON
What do you want from us

Harry grabs two manila files from the bars surface hands them
to Diego and Benson

HARRY
I need certain people off the street
Mister Stone tells me youre the men
for the job

Diego peeks into a rear window and watches as one of the ladies
of the evening drops her evening gown to the carpet and
unbuttons her bra

Harry steps closer to Diego grabs his attention

HARRY (CONTD)
Ive compiled some lists for you men
The names on these lists have become
a serious problem for me I need you
to dig up their records Find any
means necessary to make the charges
stick

Diego opens his file and takes a look

DIEGO
You want us to frame up every name
on this list

HARRY
You dont understand Detective Im
not asking you to arrest them
Diego checks with his partner who is just as unsure

LT WEINBERG (40s) a short elfish man with black wire-rimmed
glasses too large for his thin face and --

SGT VAUGHN (40s) an intense looking woman in a black business
suit and jet black hair pulled in a tight bun

WEINBERG

According to your report Detective
you first noticed the suspect reach
for his weapon upon entering the
parking lot of Lao Chens restaurant

(beat)
But your partner maintains that your
suspect didnt make a move for his
gun until after you approached the
vehicle

BENSON

Yeah well thats what I meant As
we were pulling in I saw what looked
like him popping the glove box and
when my partner and I stepped out
thats when he went for his piece

Weinberg checks with Vaughn who nods with approval

WEINBERG
Thank you Detective Thatll be all
for now
Weinberg offers an insincere smile as Rosewood looks ready to
jump out of his seat with impatience

ROSEWOOD
Thats not all

WEINBERG
You have something else for Detective
Benson

ROSEWOOD

I was just curious about something Benson

BENSON
Shoot

Lt Vaughn is put off by Bensons flippant attitude

BENSON (CONTD)
Sorry Poor choice of words

ROSEWOOD
Well I was wondering whether it was
you or Riveira who decided on that
particular parking lot to detain your
suspect

BENSON
Whatre you getting at

ROSEWOOD
ts a simple question

BENSON

Neither We ran the tag and hit the
lights The suspect pulled into the
lot and we followed

ROSEWOOD

Thats interesting I guess you didnt
know that Anthony LaRussa worked at Lao
Chens as a full time waiter

q

BENSON
No I guess I didnt Its my first
time hearing of it Is there a point
to any of this

Weinberg looks increasingly annoyed by this line of questions
He huffs under his breath

WEINBERG
If there arent any more questions for
the Detective I think this would be a
good place to end

ROSEWOOD
Just one more question

Weinberg and Vaughn roll their eyes

ROSEWOOD (CONTD)
Have you ever heard of Phan Enterprises

This catches Bensons attention He stays strangely quiet as he
avoids eye contact

WEINBERG
Okay I think thats enough for today
Thanks for coming in Detective

Benson just smiles at Rosewood as he slowly stands

BENSON
Yeah No problem Lets do it again
sometime

Benson heads out Rosewood shakes his head with contempt for
the officer as he watches him leave

Weinberg chuckles

WEINBERG (CONTD)

ROSEWOOD
The eyes never lie

WEINBERG
What

ROSEWOOD
His eyes You see how he reacted
when I mentioned Phans name

WEINBERG

Probably because he didnt know what
the hell you were talking about For
weeks you been after this Harry Phan
character and for what All you got
is the word of one cracked up hooker
lookin to get over on a cop

ROSEWOOD
A hooker who happened to disappear

TAGGERT
I wasnt such a great father to you

The banging of a knife on a champagne flute grabs everyones
attention Axel and Taggert watch as Ricky grabs a mic and
steps to the center of the floor

RICKY

say something nice about the bride and
groom As both John and Jordan already
knowIve never been very good in
front of crowds But because of them
and their love and supportIm alive
today and blessed to still have the
opportunity talk to big crowds like you
To share my story to people who are
struggling every day with drug and
alcohol abuse

(to John and Jordan)
People in dying need of that same love
and support youve given me I feel
grateful to be alive today to pay
those same blessings forward

Ricky is obviously high as John and Jordan can barely watch his
toast They sport a fake smile for the crowd

AXEL
(whispers)

An embarrassed Taggert shooshes him

RICKY
I dont wanna take up too much time
away from you guys After all this

Axel follows his look to the door but Stiggs is now gone The
crowd observes Rickys unusual behavior

RICKY (CONTD)
I just wanna say that

Ricky checks the other side of the room for Stiggs His face
moves through a crowd gathered near the punch table

Axel and Taggert follow his look toward the punch table as Axel
recognizes the evil familiar face of Stiggs smiling at Ricky

Carl our nervous manager from the Sea Horse Motel drags froma
cigarette and runs his hand across the piers railing waits not
so patiently as he checks his watch every few seconds

He turns stunned to see Harry Phan waiting some ten feet away
and puffing his own cigarette

A couple of his delinquent SOLDIERS cover Carl from both ends of
the pier boxing him in

CARL
Shit man You scared me

HARRY
Please excuse the time I hope we
havent kept you waiting

Carl watches the two soldiers on either side of him making him
nervous and unsure

CARL
I said wanted to meet alone No
guns and no goons Just us

HARRY
Now that wouldnt be very safe this
time of night Carrying around all
this money myself

Carl notices that one of the soldiers is carrying a backpack of
some sort on his shoulder

CARL
Money Whatre you talking about

HARRY
I hear youre not happy with your
current role Officer Stone tells me
the police have caught wind of our
operation and made life difficult
for you Because of this youre being
pressured to come forward

Carl grows even more nervous as the two soldiers step closer to
him looking very angry

CARL
Yeah well theyre not leaving me much
choice Theyre gonna shut me down if
I dont do something

(beat)

Stone gave me a guarantee this wouldnt
be a problem Now all of a sudden I
got cops all over my ass

HARRY
I understand The police can be very
stubborn in their pursuits They get
wind of somethingthey just dont let
up until they get their man Its the
cost of doing this kind of business
Mister Dunn A business that you just
arent cut out for Unfortunately
your involvement in this has made the
officers in my charge uncomfortable to
say the least

Soldier 1 with the backpack steps forward causes Carl stress
as he steps back

CARL
Whats he doing

HARRY
This is your early retirement Mister
Dunn All you have to do now is hand
over control of the motel to me You
let me and Mister Stone worry about
keeping the police in check

Soldier 1 unzips the bag and throws it on the pavement in front
of Carl

CARL
I see what this is Whaddya think Im
stupid Phan You and your hoods running
me out of my own motel I bet those same
cops are in your pocket too Well forget

it I want back in Fifty percent

HARRY
Im afraid thats not an option Our offer
is more than sufficient Mister Dunn If I

were you Id take it and not utter one more
fucking word about it

Carl notices Soldier 2 going for a gun and pulls his own piece
from inside his coat He draws down on Harry

CARL
Back off

Harry motions to Soldier 2 to lay off his gun He slowly pulls
his hand out of his pocket

HARRY
That wont be necessary You will take
this money and we will not speak of this

again

This is a war you cannot win Dont be
foolish
CARL
Yeah well Im gonna have to think this
over In the meantime youre gonna

sweeten the deal I want another hundred
Payable by the weeks end If you dont
have it by then Im going to the police
Well see how loyal your cop friends are
after theyre brought in for questioning

closer

man behind him releases his throat as THUG 2 kicks him in the
chest and knocks him to the asphalt

All three men all dressed like pot-head beach bums take turns

Rosewood and Taggert shake their heads in unison

AXEL (CONTD)

Cut the shit Axel I remember you very
specifically saying that you were in town
on vacation and wanted to catch up Next

mumbles under his breath Taggert watches him curious

Jenny stares at Rosewood in the rear view mirror and shes just
as enthused for this plan

JENNY
Wonderful

hostility in the air

INT RICKYS APARTMENT - NIGHT

Axel and Taggert push open the already busted open door as Axel
does a quick sweep of the front room gun drawn

The place is a disaster The cushions of the couch flipped and
the back of a leather recliner ripped to shreds as white foam
stuffing covers the carpet

Taggert checks the messy kitchen
KITCHEN
Every cabinet door and drawer have been flung open or dropped on

the floor leaving a mess of kitchen utensils tools and other
silverware

Also on the ground are various pots and pans and other cookware
A round kitchen table rests in the corner with a full can of
coffee dumped onto the surface

Several bags of potato chips and crackers have also been poured
onto the table

TAGGERT
Call me obviousbut I think someone
was having a hard time finding that
money

LIVING ROOM
On the carpet Axel picks up a busted picture frame as he avoids

being cut by the glass Its a picture of Ricky having a drink
at a club with a hot waitress on his shoulder both smiling
A look of surprise on Axel as he slowly figures out that the
girl is SKYLER his paid escort at The Pit Stop

AXEL
Hey Taggert

Taggert slowly shuffles his way into the living room

TAGGERT
What is it

AXEL
This girl with Ricky Its the same
chick I saw at The Pit Stop

Taggert grabs the photo takes a look for himself

TAGGERT
What was she A waitress

AXEL
This girl does a whole lot more than
bussing tables

TAGGERT
I wonder if Rickys aware of that

AXEL
My guess is he is

Taggert squints confused

AXEL (CONTD)
Those girls are charging two grand a
head and the place was crawlin with
suits They take in a whole helluva
lot more than twenty k a night

q

TAGGERT
Whatre you saying That Johnny was
lying about the twenty grand

AXEL
m saying if Ricky ripped this place
off he took a lot more than twenty
thousand whether Johns aware of it
or not

TAGGERT
A place like that you cant just run
in with a ski mask and stick up the
place

AXEL
Exactly Ricky says he worked for this
guy Phan Maybe he was the bag man He
gets the money from point A to point B
only --

TAGGERT
-- It never gets to point B

sack of bricks

supermarket at the exact same time
waiting in the exact same line

ROSEWOOD

ROSEWOOD
Yes it was a very brief affair to say
the least

Jenny hands everyone a drink except Rosewood

JENNY
Yes and Billy hasnt been able to let

Rosewood steps uncomfortably close to Jenny

ROSEWOOD
Thats because Jen has been unable to
accept the fact that she still has
feelings for me

JENNY

Jenny turns her back on him gulps down her drink as if hes hit
a sensitive nerve

ROSEWOOD

ROSEWOOD
Makes them an offer they cant refuse
A place to stay a free supply of junk
More money than theyve ever seen

AXEL

ROSEWOOD
Or they become too big a problem to
handle he bumps them off

Through the sliding glass walks Jenny and her surprise guest JAN

Axel Taggert and Rosewood light up as she enters the pool deck
A big smile on all their faces

AXEL

Axel laughs Jan waves at Taggert

JAN (CONTD)
Hey Uncle John

TAGGERT

Jan leans in and gives Rosewood a hug around his neck gives him
a big wet kiss on the neck and mouth

Jenny shakes her head in disgust Axel and Taggert share a big
confused smile

Axel points at Rosewood and then Jan pieces it all together as
he turns to Jenny She rolls her eyes

JAN
Hey babe

ROSEWOOD

Jan gives him another wet one on the mouth Jenny sticks her
finger down her neck as Taggert laughs

TAGGERT
(to Rosewood)

JAN

Axel laughs

AXEL
When did this happen

JAN
Oh I guess you could say it was an
accident There I was waiting in line
at the supermarket

Jenny and Axel share a funny look Taggert cant help but smile
as Rosewood bashfully looks away

JAN (CONTD)

And out of nowhere comes Billy We
hadnt talked in almost two years
and just like that There he was I
guess you could call it fate

JENNY
Yeah Fate Its a funny thing

Jenny takes another huge belt of her gin and tonic

Rosewood quickly changes the subject

ROSEWOOD
So anyways What did you find out today

JAN
So much for memory lane

Jan hands Rosewood a manila file full of paperwork He takes a
look at the thick set of papers

JAN (CONTD)
Your friend Harry Phans been a busy boy
Hes being investigated in at least eight
counts of insurance and tax fraud He
owes something in excess of four to five
million in back taxes

Taggert is now intrigued as he crawls out of the hot tub joins
the others

JAN (CONTD)
And thats just what we were able to find
God knows what else this guys into

ROSEWOOD
Anything else

JAN
My guy in the IRS says Phans big thing
now is targeting failing businesses that
are struggling financially offers a
third of what the property is worth while
the owner takes the money and runs

Taggert hangs on every word as he slowly takes a seat next to
Jenny She waves away his nasty cigar smoke

JAN (CONTD)
Meanwhile the seller keeps his name on
the books while Phan stays in the clear
When the IRS gets wind of whats going on
Phan moves on to his next target This
guys making millions under the table

Axel seems focused He hurries back to the laptop

AXEL
Rosewood Go back a few photos I
wanna check something

Rosewood grabs the mouse moves through the still images until
he stops on the YOUNG GIRL in the back alley A nightclub in
the back ground

Axel points at the long line of people in the distance Theres
some chinese writing on the wall in bright glowing NEON LETTERS

Axel sets

AXEL (CONTD)
There That club across the street
Where is this

ROSEWOOD
ts this club on Pico The Dragon Room
Why
AXEL

Listen to this
down the answering machine presses play

AXEL (CONTD)
Me and Taggert grabbed this from Rickys
apartment See if you recognize this
voice

BENSON (VO)
Times up Ricky The way I see it me
and you got a problem Stone wants you
and your friends dead and I want that
money So Ill make you a deal If you
ever wanna see that sweet young thing of
yours again youll bring me the full
ninety thousand

ROSEWOOD
Benson

BENSON (VO)
Ill tell Stone your dead and we can
all go our separate ways Like this
never happened
(beat)
Dragon Room Midnight If youre one
second late the girls dead

BENSON (VO)
Dont worry Ricky Im on your side
I hope youre not stupid

Axel hits stop on the machine

ROSEWOOD
What girl

Axel pulls the photo of Skylar and Ricky from his pants pocket

AXEL

This girl Its the same girl I saw
at The Pit Stop My guessher and
Ricky were both involved in stealing
that money

TAGGERT
He said the full ninety That means
her and Ricky took over a hundred gees
No wonder theyre so pissed off

Axel stares at the still image of the dead young woman laying in
the back alley

AXEL
The bigger question iswhos this
dead girl in the alley

ROSEWOOD
Shes an overdose Her friends called
in a 911 emergency Supposedly she
just collapsed right there in the alley

AXEL
What was the name of the girl who called
this in

ROSEWOOD

Lisa Linda Layla Something

AXEL
Lola

Rosewood suddenly realizes who it is He slumps in his chair
with a surprised look on his face

Axel seems annoyed as he quickly digs up Lolas photo
He shoves it in Rosewoods face

AXEL
Is this her

ROSEWOOD
I never talked to her She disappeared
before I could question her

AXEL
Man you guys still need me dont you
Lola was killed because she knew
something She was either involved in
this girls death or tried to blow the
whistle Either way they killed her
for it

Another realization hits Rosewood

ROSEWOOD
The redhead Reena

AXEL
Lola was too scared to come forward
about Stone so she sends her friend
Reena instead Its all coming
together now

TAGGERT
Okay Im lost

AXEL
Rosewood took a statement from a girl
about a bad cop That was Reena My
guess is she was either there that night
with Lola or decided to come forward to
keep her friend in the clear

Rosewood checks his watch
ROSEWOOD

ts after nine We got less than three
hours before Ricky meets with Benson

AXEL

That is of course if Ricky got the
message But it looks like Rickys
long gone

ROSEWOOD
Were talking ninety thousand dollars
here We should assume that Benson got
in touch with him by now If not at
home then on his cell

AXEL
In the meantime we got three hours to
come up with a game plan Otherwise
Rickys a dead man

ROSEWOOD
Were gonna need a car

JAN
Mines a two seater

Axel smiles They all turn to Jenny

JENNY
No way

AXEL
So did he fly to that medical conference
or drive

Jenny laughs

respective tables as the room fills with excited chatter

HOSTESS (CONTD)
Of coursenone of this would be
possible if it werent for one man
A man with a true vision Please

husbandMister Harry Phan

The room fills with deafening applause as Harry takes to the
podium kisses his wife

Before he can utter his first word --
AXEL struts his way to the front microphone in hand

AXEL
Thats right The man of the hour
Mister Harry Phan Give it up
I said give it up for Harry

Axel claps his palms together causing some REVERB on the hot
mic in his hand

The crowd all cover their ears

AXEL (CONTD)
I gotta tell you nobodys as excited
to be here as I am To be hereside
by side with my friend Harry Phan To
celebrate this special day I can tell
hes just as excited to see me here

Harry shoots him the look of death

AXEL (CONTD)
Look at the look on his face Priceless

AXEL (CONTD)
As many of you already knowHarry
has sacrificed a lot to be here
And faced just as many challenges
along the way

Thomopolis shifts in his seat covers up his face from view as
Axel pats him on the shoulder

AXEL (CONTD)
Nick Thomopolis ladies and gentlemen
From guns and drugs to hotels Good
to see you Nick

Thomopolis gives a quick wave hello to the crowd as he buries
his face in his hands

Axel paces the floor under the podium as Harry gives him the
thousand yard stare

AXEL (CONTD)
But one thing you need to know about
Harryis when he sets his mind to
doing something he dont let anything
or anyone get in his way Not the FBI
the IRS not even a federal indictment
can stop Harry from opening his hotel

The crowd all turn and stare whisper to one another

AXEL (CONTD)
And its not just him that deserves the
credit As I look out here into this
crowdI see the many faces that have
also sacrificed themselves and their
time to fulfill Harrys dream

There are several tables up front filled with Harrys young men
and ladies His “soldiers”

AXEL (CONTD)

Most people would say fuck it I can do
this on my own but not Harry He says I
dont care how we raise the money Stand
on the corner sling drugs prostitute
yourself it dont matter

(beat)
All that matters is the vision

A couple of Harrys Soldiers dressed in white tuxedos begin to
the front of the room eyes on Axel

AXEL (CONTD)
And I see many faces here today that have
not only given themselves but have sold
their own bodies for this man Mister Harry
Phan

As the two soldiers draw closer Harry warns them off with a nod
and a simple wave of the hand

The two soldiers reluctantly back off but hold their ground and
stare back at Axel with a look that could kill

AXEL (CONTD)
You might know them They may be sitting
next to you right now They may be your
neighbors They may even be your sons or
daughters You never know

Thomopolis quietly sneaks for the exit

AXEL (CONTD)
Nick Thomopolis He says congrats on the
hotel Harry but kiss my ass and have a
nice day Im out

Thomopolis jets for the beach never looking back Axel gives

him a nice round of applause as he pats his two palms together
and causes another wicked REVERB

The crowd all cover their ears

AXEL (CONTD)
Now I dont wanna steal the show After
all this is Harrys special day To tell
you the truth he dont have that much
longer to truly appreciate the fruits of
his labor with his upcoming trial so

Im gonna leave and let him enjoy this
little bit of time he has left in peace
So thank you Harry Enjoy your brunch
Its Miller time Thank you

Axel drops the mic on the floor as the REVERB sends the room in
an uproar He heads for the exit

INT HARRYS LIMO — DAY

Harry sits in the back with a sour scowl on his face sips ona
scotch rocks as he reflects on his ruined grand opening

He peeks through the front windshield as the limo creeps over a
steep hill and is surprised to see a POLICE ROADBLOCK sitting
dead center of the posh street

HARRY

EXT HARRY PHANS ESTATE - DAY

Along with a couple dozen SQUAD CARS marked and unmarked stand
several UNIFORMED COPS DETECTIVES and Axel and Rosewood

The limo cuts down a side street at high speed SCREECHING THE
TIRES on the asphalt

CUT TO

EXT SIDE STREETBEVERLY DRIVE - DAY

to a halt as FOUR SQUAD CARS block the street from both sides

up from behind

CUT TO

AXEL

ROSEWOOD

Axel walks to the limousine and signals the officers to back off
as he jumps in the back seat

ROSEWOOD (CONTD)
Okay Never mind Fuck me

Rosewood shakes his head gives up
CUT TO
INT HARRYS LIMO — DAY

Axel sits across from a very upset Harry The two are silent at
first as Axel sports a big wide grin

AXEL
So Here we are I never really had
a chance to introduce myself My
name is Axel Foley

Axel pulls the photo of Lola from his coat pocket Hands it to
Harry

AXEL (CONTD)
And that is Lola Shes the reason
I got into this mess

Harry looks at the photo

HARRY
Pretty girl
AXEL
She was She got killed

HARRY
Thats too bad

AXEL
Yeah I can tell youre real broken
up about it

HARRY
Lola was special Fresh Not yet
bruised by the ugliness of the world
and so full of life and promise I
had high hopes for her But like
so many others she chose to throw it
away And for what Peace of mind

Harry scoffs

HARRY (CONTD)
Your police department pretends to
care yet thousands of young women
just like her are still on the
street and they do nothing

Harry leans in closer to Axel

HARRY (CONTD)
How long do you think the Lolas of
this world can last on their own
gave her a home I made a place
for her And for many like her
And your friends in the police chose
to get her killed

Harry laughs

HARRY (CONTD)
For what So they can get the bad
guy No matter who dies in the
process

(beat)
You think Im the problem My friend
youre the problem

Axel plays interested as he slumps forward in his seat and rests
his face in his hands in a mocking fashion
HARRY (CONTD)
Youre the problem because you and all
like you refuse to face your own greed
You see it aS a cancer Something dark
and unholy Lola knew who she was and
what she wanted and she went after it
And now shes dead for what

(Laughs)
Because she chose to do the right thing
Now dont you think if she had the
chance to do it over again shed do
things a bit differently

(serious)
The hypocrisy of the police department
is almost absurd

Axel takes a moment to soak it all up

AXEL
You know I was a cop for twenty five
years and Ive come up against some
real nasty bastards but you
(beat)
Youre something special

Harry smiles and nods

AXEL (CONTD)
Anyways I just wanted you to get a
good look at my face You know so
you can think of it every night when
youre cryin yourself to sleep in
your prison cell and masturbating
with your own tears and shit like
that

Harry is seconds from pulling his gun on Axel as he grips his
pistol tighter and tighter

AXEL (CONTD)
Do me a favor though Just when youre
gettin ready to finish think Axel
Foley Every day youre gonna be
saying to yourself Im in here playin
with my own shit and never gonna get
pussy again cos of Axel Foley
Thats what I want you to do
AXEL (CONTD)

or not but theres some cops outside
waiting so Ill let them to it
Take care of yourself

Axel steps out but stops half way

AXEL (CONTD)
Oh yeah One more thing

Harry waits for it

AXEL (CONTD)

Axel spits dead in his face A smug smile on Harrys face as he
slowly wipes it away

AXEL (CONTD)
Thats for Lola

Axel goes on his way leaves Harry to himself as the officers
quickly place him in custody
