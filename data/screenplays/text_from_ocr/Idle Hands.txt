FADE IN

BOLAN OREGON -- PRESENT DAY

INT BEDROOM - NIGHT

A middle-aged middle-class woman NORMA shuffles through
the bedroom door in dusty once-fluffy slippers a cup of tea
in her hand calling over her shoulder to her husband

NORMA
Just once a week Gary It really
doesnt cost that much

She turns back the bedspread as GARY follows her in his bare
feet slapping on the hardwood floor

GARY
Its a waste

Norma hangs both of their bathrobes from pegs on the doors
backside and sets her teacup still half-full next to the
telephone on a table just inside the door

She faces him
NORMA
Betty Johnson won a 500 blackout
last Saturday

The mattress sags under Garys weight He doesnt respond
She climbs into bed beside him

NORMA
Ill bet her husband doesnt think
Bingos a waste Ill bet he was
happy to help spend that 500

GARY
Good night Norma

He switches the bedside lamp off In the darkness they
settle back into the pillows and LOOK UP

Scrawled on the ceiling in glow-in-the-dark paint are the
chilling words

IM UNDER THE BED

Norma SCREAMS

Sitting bolt-upright Gary snaps the lamp back on and puts a
steadying hand on his wifes shaking shoulder

GARY
(gruffly)
That little bastard If he thinks
this is funny Ill make damn sure
he thinks again

NORMA
Check
GARY
What
NORMA

Please Check under the bed

GARY
Its a prank thats all Anton--

NORMA
Anton hasnt been home all day
He didnt do this Oh God Gary
what if--

GARY
Norma no ones there trust me

He swings over the edge of the bed shoving the overhanging
blankets out of his way Upside-down he looks under the bed
and then hauls himself back up

GARY
Okay Nada Now can we-

She gasps grabbing his arm

NORMA
I heard something downstairs

Gary groans

GARY
Jesus Norma

NORMA
Please I wont be able to sleep

GARY
(sighing exasperated)
Fine
Getting up he yanks his bathrobe from its peg and opens the
door

NORMA
Be careful

Gary rolls his eyes and heads out

Norma clutches the blanket tight listening to his footsteps
descending the stairs and fading into the house until she
cant hear him at all

Alone she fidgets nervously looking back up at the ceiling
The painted words are invisible in the lamplight

She scoots into the very center of the bed gathering the
covers around her and calls

NORMA
Gary

She listens hard her entire body straining toward the open
door but there is no answer

NORMA
(louder)

Gary
A DULL THUD is barely audible deep within the house

Her breath catches in her throat and she scrambles off the
bed hurrying out the door

INT UPSTAIRS HALL - SAME

Norma looks up and down the hall dark except for a little
moonlight from the windows The house is quiet

On tiptoe careful not to make a sound she moves along the
wall toa closed door

She slowly turns the doorknob opening the door a tiny crack
and peeks into a BEDROOM

NORMA
(whispering)
Anton

The twin bed against the far wall is empty Norma continues
silently toward the stairwell
INT ENTRY WAY DOWNSTAIRS -— SAME

Downstairs the ceiling creaks as Norma moves above The
entry way glows with the soft moonlight filtering in through
frosted windows flanking the front door

At the bottom of the staircase beside a small table GARYS
HEAD AND SHOULDERS are visible on the floor His eyes are
wide open and a tiny bit of black-red blood trickles from his
mouth The rest of his body is hidden in shadow

Just as Garys head slides across the floor DRAGGED INTO THE
SHADOWS by ‘an unseen force Norma appears at the top of the
staircase She looks down and sees nothing

NORMA
(whispering)
Gary Gary

She creeps slowly down the stairs her hands fumbling for the
banister

At the bottom she checks the front door The deadbolt is
fastened tightly and the security alarm panel on the wall

shows that the alarm is still on She looks around the entry
way

A slight SCRABBLING SOUND comes from the shadows and she
whirls stepping toward the noise

NORMA
Gary what--

Something SHOOTS OUT OF THE DARKNESS directly at her Norma
SCREAMS covering her face as the thing hits her

Its a cat kicking and clawing at her

Norma breathes in relief recognizing it Wrapping her arms
around it she holds the cat tight and it calms Its a ‘
normal black and white housecat

NORMA
Bones Its okay kitty

She leans to set the cat on the floor

NORMA
Its okay Wheres Ga--

She stops cold A small PUDDLE OF BLOOD on the floor
glistens wetly in the moonlight

She drops the cat and races up the stairs

INT BEDROOM - SAME

Norma runs into the bedroom grabbing the phone off the table
by the door Holding the receiver to her ear she rushes for
the bed Her teacup topples and smashes on the floor as the
phone cord stretches out behind her

Fingers shaking breathing hard she dials a 9 then a 1
WHAM

The PHONE CORD IS YANKED behind her The phone flies out of
her hands

She whips around to face the door and her face contorts in
PURE TERROR She SCREAMS

INT ANTONS BEDROOM - DAY

BONES the cat leaps onto a rumpled twin bed jolting 17-
year-old ANTON awake The clock reads 317 PM Anton
stretches

In a patch of autumn sunlight the cat begins cleaning
herself but shes the only one Anton merely grabs a faded
purple T-shirt from a pile of dirty clothes on his floor and
heads for the door in a baseball cap and boxers

INT LIVING ROOM — SAME

Anton lights about 30 sticks of incense and plops onto the
couch

INT ENTRY WAY - SAME

Bones follows Anton downstairs pausing at the little PUDDLE
OF BLOOD on the floor unnoticed by Anton Bones licks up
the blood

INT LIVING ROOM - SAME

Anton slides a long plastic backscratcher from between two
couch cushions He gives his nuts a scratch or two and then
uses the backscratcher to drag the TV remote over from the

far side of the coffee table

He flips on the TV and sneaks a look around Not a soul in
sight

Reaching under the couch with the backscratcher he pulls out
an already-loaded Bart Simpson bong Anton sparks up
inhaling the entire contents through a tube in Barts butt

CELEB on TV
You too can be financially independent
Own the house of your dreams travel
live in luxury

Anton exhales slowly paying rapt attention to the
infomercial until --

CELEB on TV
But this is no get-rich-quick scam It

requires motivation dedication and
good old-fashioned hard work--

CLICK

Cartoons much better As Bones curls up beside him and
cleans blood off her whiskers Antons stomach GROWLS loudly
He glances around and sees a Burger King bag near his feet

He hooks the bag with his trusty backscratcher and pulls out
a decaying half-eaten Whopper

He sniffs the burger tears some of the green bits off its
perimeter and takes a bite He chews once and immediately
spits it back into the bag

Sighing complainingly and with exaggerated effort Anton
shoves Bart back into hiding hauls his butt off the couch
and plods toward the kitchen

INT KITCHEN — SAME

Anton pours a bowl of Lucky Charms and opens the fridge
Barren

He tilts the milk carton over his cereal

PLOP One drop

ANTON
Mom Were out of milk

Mom doesnt answer DANZIG the German Shepherd whines and
pokes his empty food dish with his nose -

ANTON
You hungry Danzig What does she
think you can feed yourself
He gives Danzig a pat and opens a cupboard Its bare

ANTON
Mom Were out of dog food

Still no response He pours the dog a bowl of Lucky Charms

INT LIVING ROOM - SAME

Anton flops back onto the couch munching dry cereal and
scans the area Again no ones around

He pulls the bong out again and tries to spark but the
bowls empty He feels around under the couch with the -
backscratcher and drags out a plastic baggie

Empty

He tries again fishing out another baggie Empty One more
try He shoves the backscratcher as far under the couch as
he can reach and methodically pats around

Suddenly he pulls his hand back triumphantly clutching his
booty but this baggies empty too

ANTON
Fuck

He grabs the cordless beside him and punches numbers
ANTON

(into phone)
Mick whats up Im dry

MICK
(on phone)
So
ANTON
So how ‘bout bringing over a
dimer
MICK
(on phone)

Yeah Ill drop it down your chimney
on my way to the North Pole you lazy
fuck Come over here and get it

ANTON
Aw cmon Im busy
MICK
(on phone)
Put your dick away and get over here

BEEP BEEEEEP The red battery light flashes on the
cordless

ANTON
Fine

He hangs up and shoves bong and baggies under the couch He
looks around the room and groans -- his shoes are clear over
by the TV

But Antons in luck -- his Moms fuzzy slippers lay strewn by
the side of the couch within easy reach of his
backscratcher Anton doesnt notice the DROPS OF BLOOD
speckling the slippers

INT ENTRY WAY SAME

Anton drops the still-beeping cordless into its base on the
entry table plucking his sunglasses off the same table and
noticing his mothers purse lying there

ANTON
(yelling)
Mom
(no answer)
Mom Spot me some cash

Still no answer Fuck it He reaches into his moms purse
and purloins a ten-dollar bill careful to leave everything
how he found it

Almost out the door he looks at the money and rethinks it
Reaching back into the purse he grabs another 10

EXT STREET - SAME

Wearing his T-shirt baseball cap boxer shorts and blood-
flecked slippers Anton steps outside The cold Oregon sun
smacks him in the face and he quickly puts his sunglasses on
He can see his breath faintly in the brisk October air

From the house on his left heavy metal music pounds into the
afternoon

Sighing Anton turns right and begins his tiresome journey
Two houses down the block he cuts across a yard and climbs
through an open window

INT MICKS BEDROOM - SAME

Anton comes through the window shivering MICK PNUB and
JIMMY all high-school seniors are sitting on Micks bed
smoking out and engaging in philosophical debate

PNUB
Yeah and if your mom had teeth she
wouldnt suck dick so well Whats
your point

Jimmy finishes his hit passes the bong to Anton and speaks
while exhaling

JIMMY
My point is that unlike you Pnub
Ive taken on a certain degree of
responsibility Whats up Anton
Nice boxers

Anton looks down slightly embarrassed at his pantslessness

PNUB
Responsibility my nutsack You
sit around your dads meat locker
all day and flirt with that old
lady who answers the phone That
bitch has less teeth than your mom

JIMMY

You know what these are

(jangling a ring of keys

in Pnubs face)
These are keys boy Keys My dads
Placed the ultimate trust in me Im
being prepped to take over the entire
meat processing empire

The bong has traveled full circle and Jimmy pauses for
another hit

JIMMY

(holding the smoke in)
Just last week when they installed
this new temperature-controlling
machine -- you guys should see this
monster it can bring the whole storage
area from 100 degrees to the fucking
ice age in like seconds Anyway
whose ass do you think was in charge
of overseeing the entire process

Jimmy stands up and points at his own ass

Wearing a DAR-E to Keep Kids Off Drugs T-shirt Mick

MICK
Were all really happy for your ass
Jimmy Being an enterprising young
man myself I can relate

pulls out a baggie of pot and exchanges it for one of Antons
ten-dollar bills

Anton takes his cap off and slides the baggie into a hidden

slot under the bill

They all nod

ANTON
I know Im jealous Jimmy can look
forward to a future filled with tooth-
less receptionists and raw meat while
Mick has a lovely career of license-
plate making just around the corner

MICK
What about your future hotrod

ANTON
Im not going to worry about that shit
(taking a hit off the bong)
Its best to just let life happen

PNUB
At least until your parents kick your
Oily ass out

ANTON
(frowning)
I havent seen my parents in a couple
of days

MICK
Maybe they went on vacation

PNUB

ANTON

‘day was Friday right

ANTON

Pnub smacks Jimmys leg

JIMMY

ANTON

MICK
(shrugging)
Your parents probably just decided
to slip away for a romantic weekend
and your mom forgot her purse No
big whoop

PNUB
At any rate party at Antons

Mick lowers the bong and peers out the window

MICK
Hey here comes your woman Anton

Anton rushes to the window and ducks He slowly lifts one
eye just above the sill so he can see without being seen

MOLLY 17 and drop-dead zooms past on a Harley

PNUB
Mollys lived across the street from
you for like what ever I think
its about time you told her about
your disturbing obsession with her

JIMMY
While youre at it you should tell
her your name

MICK
Back off guys Anton doesnt believe
in taking initiative
(to Anton)
Dont listen to them You just let
life happen

ANTON
(giving Mick a dirty look)

right now

He starts out the window
MICK
You want to borrow some pants Chief
First impressions and all

ANTON
Youre a bud

Mick points at his closet Anton grabs a fresh pair of jeans
and hastily yanks them on Kicking off the slippers he
Salutes his friends and crawls out the window

JIMMY
Think hes got a shot with her

PNUB
Snowball in hell

They all nod Mick reloads the bong

EXT STREET - SAME

By the time Anton makes it out Micks door Molly is already
parking the hog in her driveway at the end of the block

Anton crosses to her side of the street and heads toward her
with resolve

EXT MOLLYS HOUSE - SAME

Molly slides her leather-clad butt off the seat and
disappears into her house Anton leans against a tree and
looks expectantly at an upper window

Sure enough a light goes on and Molly moves into view in the
upper window a dark-haired goddess of rebellion

Anton gazes wistfully longingly up at her until she glances
outside and sees him He averts his eyes and quickly walks
away

EXT EUREKA CALIFORNIA SHERIFFS OFFICE — DAY
A huge Winnebago parks in front of the Sheriffs office

DEBI LECURE steps out of the motor home with a newspaper in
her hand and a parrot on her shoulder Shes about 28 with
long painted nails and teased Jersey-girl hair

Debi tosses the newspaper onto the drivers seat and gently
sets the parrot on top of the newspaper The headline under
the bird reads SUSPECT CAUGHT IN EUREKA SLAYINGS

DEBI
to the parrot)
Wait here Hot Train Ive got to
look respectable

Hot Train doesnt respond Debi slips on a pair of
intellectual-looking glasses and locks the parrot in the
motor home

INT SHERIFFS OFFICE - SAME

Debi approaches the DEPUTY behind the holly-decked main desk
carrying herself stiffly

DEBI
Excuse me Its of the utmost
importance that I speak to Sheriff
Buchanan

DEPUTY
Sorry maam but as you can
imagine the Sheriffs pretty busy

DEBI
Perhaps if you understood the gravity
of the situation
The door to the back office opens and ‘a burly tree-trunk of a
man SHERIFF BUCHANAN enters the reception area

DEBI -
You must be Sheriff Buchanan Im
Debi LeCure

She extends a hand The Sheriff ignores it

SHERIFF BUCHANAN
I thought I ran all you creepy press
people out of here

DEBI
Im not with the press Sir its
imperative that I speak with Clement
James right away

SHERIFF BUCHANAN
Nobody talks to Clement James ‘cept
his lawyer and the investigating
officers

DEBI
I too am an investigator of sorts

SHERIFF BUCHANAN
Is that a fact Look Miss Liqueur-—-

DEBI
LeCure

SHERIFF BUCHANAN
Between you and me there aint a
whole lot of investigating to be done
We caught him in his bathroom shaving
a cat and wearing nothing but his
grannys skivvies No law against
that yet but the half-dozen dead
bodies lounging around his house gives
me a wee hunch hes guilty

DEBI
I dont doubt his guilt My interest
lies solely with his motive Has he
attributed his actions to any sort of
supernatural intervention

SHERIFF BUCHANAN

What information Clement James has
revealed to the investigating officers
is strictly confidential

(he pauses then)
But seeing as youre kinda cute and
not with the press I dont mind
telling you off the record that he
aint said shit His mind is so far
gone I doubt if hell ever utter
another word

Debi slumps visibly disappointed
DEBI
I see
INT WINNEBAGO - A MOMENT LATER
Debi scooches the parrot to one side and climbs into the
drivers seat dropping both the glasses and the intellectual
act
DEBI
Well bird of mine looks like
another dead end

Hot Train doesnt answer Debi starts her engine crooning
to the parrot

DEBI
Pretty bird Hello pretty bird
Talk you fuck
EXT STREET - DUSK
Carrying a brown paper sack and a bag of dog kibble Anton
frowns He stops walking and looks suspiciously into the

gathering mist around hin

He takes a few steps and looks again No one

As Anton continues walking an UNIDENTIFIABLE FIGURE STALKS
HIM staying almost entirely under the mists cover Theres
something SHIMMERY SILVERY about him but then again it may
just be the mist

The figure pulls back into the shadows as Anton glances over
his shoulder listening hard

Suddenly Anton whips his head around to face his stalker
but finds only the shifting mist The SILVERY FIGURE has
VANISHED

Shivering Anton steps into the street

Without warning hes THROWN TO THE GROUND His groceries
spill into the street

A billy club is pressed hard against the back of his neck
shoving his face into the asphalt

VOICE (0S)
Frisk him 1I11 check his bag

Hes thoroughly patted down His baseball cap is removed and
Anton holds his breath

VOICE (0S)
Roll over

Anton rolls onto his back to see TWO UNIFORMED POLICE
OFFICERS in their early twenties sporting the nametags RUCK
and MCMACY

RUCK
(kicking Antons grocery bag)
Nothing here You

Antons hat is in McMacys hands being inspected Anton
tries not to look nervous

McMACY
Hes clean

McMacy leans over and jerks the baseball cap down on Antons
head the secret hiding place undiscovered

RUCK
Damn

Relieved Anton scrambles of the street and scoops his
groceries back into the bag
ANTON
Since when is it against the law
to grocery-shop
(looking up‘at them
double-taking)
Hey I know you two Werent you

RUCK
(sinister)

McMACY
(hauling Anton to his feet)
You and your fancy little clique
zipping around on your skateboards
Thought you were too cool for us

RUCK
(yanking Anton his way)

But now were cops Anton Your

ANTON
(shaking his head amused)
Ooh Theres sure nothing scarier
than a spiteful nerd with a power
woody

RUCK
(narrowing his eyes)
Empty your pockets boy

ANTON
Nice try but theyre not even my pants
Anton pulls out a crumpled dollar and some change but
something else comes out too falling to the ground a
BAGGIE

McMacy pockets Antons money and snatches the baggie up He
opens it and inhales deeply

McMACY
Smells like marijuana to me Write

ANTON

Ruck scribbles on aticket pad
ANTON
What I know my rights You cant
cite me for possession of baggie
Ruck and McMacy laugh

RUCK
Jaywalking Maximum fine 200

Ruck tucks the ticket into Antons grocery bag

INT LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Anton tears the jaywalking ticket into strips and lays them
out on the coffee table Removing his stash from his hat he
rolls each ticket-strip into a FAT JOINT

He sits back lights up and hears a noise a FLOORBOARD
CREAKS upstairs Anton pauses listening

Another CREAK right above him He mutes the TV Lying at
his feet Danzig is PANTING loudly Anton reaches down and
CLOSES the DOGS MOUTH

He listens again but this time the house is silent

He shakes his head dismissing it and returns to channel-
surfing

INT KITCHEN - LATER

As an Everclear video comes to a loud crashing end Anton

pours dog kibble into both Danzigs and Bones’ bowls The
pets eat

The familiar notes-of the MTV NEWS THEME SONG swell up in the
living room Watching TV through the open kitchen door
Anton dumps his groceries on the counter -- bologna white
bread mayo -- and starts making a sandwich

TABITHA SOREN (OS)
This is Tabitha Soren with MTV World
News

Without taking his eyes off the TV he opens the silverware
drawer and fishes around pulling out a huge evilly sharp
knife -- the blade is covered with DRIED BLOOD

Anton twists the top of the mayonnaise

TABITHA SOREN (OS)
Therell be no trick-or-treating for
One town this year Bolan Oregon
a small suburb of Portland has been
terrorized by seemingly random slayings
for the past week

Without looking down he swirls the knife in the mayo and
bits of dried blood come off

Oblivious Anton spreads it on his bread slaps on some
processed meat and raises the sandwich to his mouth

TABITHA SOREN (0S)
Six bodies have been discovered to
date and the killer is still at large
With Halloween only one day away Bolan
police are advising extra caution
Anton takes a bite chews and
LOOKS DOWN --
The bloody knife sticks out of the rust-flecked mayo
ANTON GAGS

In pure terror he drops his sandwich and flattens himself
against the wall

ANTON
Hes here Hes in my house

He scans the room wild-eyed but the only sounds are the TV
and the dogs eating

ANTON
(half-whimpering)
Danzig Cmere boy

The German Shepherd trots over from his food dish

ANTON
(whispering to the dog)
If you see hear or smell a psycho

Anton points him at the living room and gives hima shove

INT LIVING ROOM SAME

Danzig SLIDES across the hardwood floor on his butt coming
to a stop at the coffee table

Anton peers out from the kitchen Danzig looks back at him
quizzically and Anton slips into the room latching tightly
onto the dog

ANTON
Okay Danzig Were gonna make it

He creeps toward the entry way in a panic pointing Danzig in
the direction of every little NOISE

INT ENTRY WAY - SAME

With a firm grip on Danzigs collar Antons nearly to the
front door

TABITHA SOREN (OS)

Oh shit Hes out there

He races up the stairs with Danzig following

INT ANTONS BEDROOM - SAME

Anton slams his door shut gasping for breath and climbs
onto his bed hugging the dog The house is full of CREAKS
and GROANS amplified by Antons fright

ANTON

(to the dog)
Okay the plan The killers on the
porch but the doors locked Hell

Psycho killers only come out at night

As he reaches to turn off the light his closet door CREAKS
OPEN an inch

Danzig BARKS Anton bolts from the room

INT PARENTS BEDROOM - SAME

Anton tears into the PARENTS BEDROOM FROM SCENE 1 lit by
the same bedside lamp The phone is back in its place but
the long cord is slick with blood Anton doesnt notice

He leaps onto his parents‘ bed pulls the covers up to his
neck and cowers He takes a deep breath and tells himself

ANTON
The sooner you go to sleep the
sooner itll be morning

He snaps off the lamp and lies back Looking up at the
ceiling he freezes seeing the glow-in-the-dark paint

IM UNDER THE BED
Anton is paralyzed with fear His mouth is open but silent

A beat then Anton hurls himself off the bed and out the door
terror-stricken

INT ENTRY WAY - SAME

SCREAMING Anton flies down the stairs looking back over his
shoulder in complete hysteria

On his way to the door he grabs the cordless off the table
but the floor-length TABLECLOTH TRIPS HIM

Anton goes sprawling and the table CRASHES to the floor
exposing to Antons horror --

the MUTILATED BODIES of his PARENTS

His mothers face is frozen in a pleading expression her
closed fist held upward by a stiff arm

Anton GASPS

He glances up the staircase with dread but the killer has
yet to show himself

Unlocking the front door Anton scoops up Bones pushes
Danzig outside and runs

phone in the other Danzig at his heels

He hurdles a short hedge landing in Mollys yard

EXT MOLLYS YARD - SAME

Mollys house is dark Anton drops to his knees behind the
hedge trying to catch his breath Bones and Danzig eye him

Anton looks through the thick leaves at his house Its
quiet and still dark except for the entry way light and the
flickering of the TV in the living room

He yanks the cordless phones antenna to its full length and
DIALS 911

ANTON
(into phone)

joint across the yard

His purple T-shirt is speckled with small blotches of paint
GLOWING in the darkness He holds up the bottom of the shirt

ANTON
Okay Stay calm

He whirls to look through the hedge again

His house is still silent motionless No killer in sight
He stands up musters his courage and creeps stealthily
toward his house

EXT PORCH - SAME

PUZZLE-PIECE MATCH

QUICK FLASHES

Turning back Anton sees Mick SLUMP to the floor

Antons BEER BOTTLE BROKEN is PLANTED DEEP in Micks
forehead Anton looks down at his empty hand in disbelief

The DOORBELL RINGS again and Anton wastes no time pushing the
bodies -- Micks included -- into the coat closet

Anton closes the closet door and rubs out a spot of blood
with his shoe

ANTON

The cops turn to saunter down the porch steps Anton slams
the door He fingers Micks jacket forlornly before heading
into the living room

INT LIVING ROOM - SAME

Pnub and Jimmy already have their pot back out loading their
bowls to the last few notes of You Got Lucky Babe On the
TV Tom Petty drives away in his space buggy and the video

ANTON

lot of control over--

PNUB
(cutting him off)
Shhhh Its on

Pnubs eyes are fixed on the TV and he doesnt even look for
the cause of the loud sudden SLICING SOUND next to him or
the subsequent GURGLE

JIMMYS HEAD rolls into his own lap unrestrained by his
neck It bounces just a little and continues to the floor
landing with a dull thud on Pnubs scuffed Chuck Taylors

ANTON
(aghast)
Shit Pnub Pnub

Pnub tears himself from the TV and turns just in time to see
Jimmys body follow his head to the floor INNARDS spill out
through a GAPING WOUND in Jimmys chest

PNUB
Fucking Christ

Anton comes around the couch looking with absolute terror at
the huge knife in his hand Blood (and a little mayo) drips
from the knifes wicked tip

ANTON
(freaking)
How does this keep happening

Pnub scrambles backward into a corner shaking as Anton
advances on him unable to stop

PNUB
Are you out of your mind Snap
out of it Its me Pnub your buddy

Anton FIGHTS WITH HIMSELF holding the knife out at Pnub with
his right hand and trying to restrain it with his left

ANTON
I know who you are Pnub you dumb
fuck Im not doing this on purpose

Anton struggles to hold himself back but she’ s drawn
irresistibly toward Pnub
ANTON
Get out of here I dont know how
long I can hold off

Anton steps over Jimmys body A bloody ARTERY catches on
his shoe and STRETCHES as Anton moves toward Pnub slowly
pulling Jimmys heart from his chest

JIMMYS HEART SLIPS ACROSS THE FLOOR behind Anton as

TOM PETTY STEVIE NICKS
(singing on TV)
Stop draggin my stop draggin my
stop draggin my heart around
Its too much for Pnub He SCREAMS

Anton looms above Pnub knife glinting nub covers his head
with his arms Anton REACHES DOWN

and grabs Pnubs hand hauling him to his feet Pnub
SHRIEKS

Anton shoves Pnub toward the front door Giving Jimmys
corpse a wide berth Pnub stubs his toes on the TV

ANTON
Run damn it

The knife raises Antons hand into the air Anton grapples
with it using all his might to keep the knife still

ANTON
Run

Pnub limps hurriedly for the door as
VOICE FROM NOWHERE
(sinister whisper)
Kill him

Anton looks wildly around the room for the source of the
‘voice

VOICE FROM NOWHERE
(louder)
Kill him

Antons own SCREAMS add to Pnubs as his right arm is pulled
back like a catapult by an UNSEEN FORCE

Just as Pnub reaches the door the unseen force lets go of
Antons arm and the KNIFE ZINGS THROUGH THE AIR

slamming into the back of Pnubs skull with a SICKENING
SMACK

Pnub crumples Still SCREAMING Anton covers his eyes and
runs blindly out the door

EXT STREET - SAME

Anton hightails it across lawns and driveways in utter
hysteria tripping over the hedge and sprawls into Mollys

yard

Panting he leaps to his feet and races down the block

EXT PARK - SAME

Anton half-runs half-stumbles into the park gasping for
breath and checking behind him ‘Several sections of the
parks thick hedge are ROPED OFF with yellow police crime
scene tape

He rushes for a set of monkey bars but the entire structure
COLLAPSES just as hes about to duck under it

Anton veers to the right floundering into the sandbox and
the BLOODY KNIFE THRUSTS up out of the sand in front of him

He whirls again disoriented as a DISEMBODIED LAUGH fills
the park an evil bone-chilling rumble rising from nowhere
and everywhere

Anton bones out heading back towards home

EXT STREET - SAME

Anton hurries down the dark street spooked by every sound
and trying hard to keep a look-out in every direction

Suddenly the KNIFE SHOVES THROUGH THE SIDEWALK between his
legs pointing the tip STRAIGHT UP at his balls

Anton yelps startled out of his wits and dives behind a
bush in someones front yard

A LIGHT GOES ON in the house Its Mollys house Its
Mollys bedroom light She opens her window and looks down
at the rustling bush

MOLLY
Whos out there

Anton rolls out of the bush onto the grass

MOLLY
(smirking a little)
Oh its you

ANTON
(brushes himself off)
Hi Sorry about your bush

The KNIFE APPEARS in Antons hand He quickly hides it
behind his back and flings it to the ground

MOLLY
Not a problem Are you planning
to do this all night

The knife puts itself firmly in Antons hand again

ANTON
Do what

Behind his back he tries to drop the knife but it seems to
be attached He shakes his hand The knife remains

MOLLY
Sneak around myyard How many
times have you been here tonight

ANTON
(distracted)
Uh twice

He shakes the knife violently behind his back but it refuses
to leave his hand

MOLLY
Wait there

She disappears from her window Of its own accord Antons
hand brings the knife in front of his body His other hand
joins the first on the knife handle and the evil blade POINTS
straight at Mollys door

Anton immediately turns away Holding the knife over the
bush Anton gives his hands a sharp fierce BITE

He yelps and drops the knife It falls into the bush just as
Molly opens the front door

MOLLY
Get in here before someone sees you

Anton heads inside and Molly closes the door

INT MOLLYS BEDROOM —- SAME

Anton and Molly enter her room quietly She looks him up and
down

MOLLY
Jesus look at you

Anton looks at himself His shirt and Micks pants are
covered with blood dirt and bush

ANTON
I got into a fight at the park

MOLLY -
You sure got your ass kicked

ANTON
I did okay

MOLLY
So you ran and hid in my bush

Antons eyes focus on a letter opener on Mollys desk and
gets a QUICK FLASH of the letter opener VICIOUSLY SLASHING
Mollys throat open

Anton shakes the image from his head but POTENTIAL WEAPONS
seem to leap out at him a stapler an extension cord a
hairdryer a Hello Kitty pen and pencil set

Anton shudders

ANTON
I really shouldnt be here

MOLLY
Its okay My parents sleep like the
dead Besides you shouldnt be on
the streets at night Dont you know
theres a killer out there

Antons hands abruptly grab Molly and pull her close
bringing their faces just an inch apart Anton plants a
passionate kiss on her

MOLLY
(coming up for air)
Im impressed The way youve been
creeping around and spying on me
I never wouldve thought youd have
the balls to just kiss me like that

ANTON
(surprised at himself)
Me neither

She grins and pushes him onto the bed He pulls off her
shirt She closes her eyes as he runs his hands up her
stomach over her breasts and ONTO HER THROAT

His hands linger circling her neck itching to squeeze

until he forces them to glide over her face and through her
hair

Hot Train tilts his head toward her maddeningly silent

DEBI

She stomps away snapping all the curtains shut After
making sure every door is securely locked Debi crawls under
the kitchen table with the C JAMES file folder

A small thick SAFE is snugly wedged beneath the table

Debi deftly positions each of the safes three combination
locks and pulls the heavy door open

Hundreds of files each headed with a different name and
packed with newsprint are stacked inside As Debi adds the
new file her hand brushes against the ONLY OTHER ITEM in the

A tightly-rolled SCROLL of ancient parchment GLOWS brightly
in the dark safe

INT MOLLYS BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING

Anton wakes with a start and looks at Molly Shes lying on
the bed very still Panicky he grabs a hand mirror from
her night stand and holds it to her open mouth It fogs up

He breathes a sigh of relief Putting his clothes on Anton
goes to the window and stares out at the cold morning
melancholy until --

A hand touches his shoulder Anton whips around in a panic
but its just Molly wrapped in a blanket She laughs
lightly

MOLLY
At ease soldier What are you doing

ANTON
Thinking about the snow plow Its
almost winter

MOLLY
Hand me that teddy

Anton gives her the stuffed bear on the windowsill She
pulls a baggie of The Kind from a hole in the bears belly
-and Anton smiles

Molly smiles back and rolls a nice tight joint They pass
it back and forth

MOLLY
What about the snow plow

ANTON

The first really big snow I can
remember I was four I was so
jazzed I spent all day making this
amazing snow fort with two tunnel
entrances and enough room inside to
stand up straight It was the biggest
baddest thing Id ever done

(pausing remembering)
Then my mom called me in I was at
the window staring at it so proud
when I heard this huge rumble I
watched helpless as a snow plow
flattened it

He meets Mollys eyes and shrugs

ANTON
Now I just figure whats the point

MOLLY
Whyd you build your fort in the street

Anton looks stunned Finally in- wonderment

ANTON
I dont know

They hear a DOOR CREAK OPEN somewhere in the house Molly
looks at the clock -- 645 am

MOLLY -

trouble latching onto someone good

Danzig continues to stare up at him

ANTON

Anton turns the dog around and gives him a gentle shove

Danzig goes as far as the sidewalk and looks back at

Anton takes a big gulp of air
ANTON

Danzig finally trots off down the street

ANTON

Anton creeps slowly toward the sound

Anton stops short The voice seems to be coming from his
fresh grave A moments hesitation and then he goes slowly
to the graves edge

The ground starts to rise cracking open slightly Anton
glances around wildly

ANTON
Danzig Danzig come back boy

But the dog is long gone Anton is breathing hard scared

A chilling MOAN rumbles from the ground as the crack widens

Anton looks around in a panic for something anything -

the SHOVEL Its on the other side of the opening grave
Anton crawls toward it on his hands and knees

Taking his eyes off the grave for a split-second he lunges
for the shovel Just as his fingers are about to close
around the handle the shovel is WHISKED AWAY

Anton spins around

MICKS DIRTY DECOMPOSING BODY is HALF OUT OF THE GRAVE
broken beer bottle still embedded in his forehead

Anton falls backward Mick LOOMS ABOVE HIM brandishing the
shovel Anton can barely whisper

ANTON
Please dont kill me

Mick RAISES THE SHOVEL Antons eyes widen in terror and --

MICK
Dont be stupid Why would I want
to kill you

Mick uses the shovel to dig his body the rest of the way out
of the dirt Glimpses of Jimmy and Pnubs bodies are visible
in the grave

ANTON
(relaxing a little)
Okay good Wow Im really glad
youre alive Mick

Anton slings an arm affectionately over his buddys shoulder
-- and abruptly double-takes on the dried blood caked around
the bottle embedded in Micks forehead Mick is an unearthly
shade of pale to boot

MICK
(off Antons frown)

ANTON
Just a sec

Anton grabs the beer bottle and YANKS tearing the broken
glass from Micks skull A large CHUNK of MICKS FLESH comes
away with it exposing bone but not a single drop of blood

appears in the open doorway He knocks on the door frame

GRAMS

ANTON
Hows it going Grams

GRAMS
Come in Sit sit

Anton pulls up a Chair

GRAMS
Look how youve grown Youre
getting to be such a handsome
young buck How are your parents

- ANTON
Thats kinda what I want to talk
to you about

A badly-wrinkled OLD MAN moseys in and sits on the arm of
Grams chair He puts his hand on her knee

GRAMS
Anton Id like you to meet my
boyfriend Leon

ANTON
I was hoping we could speak in
private

LEON

Let me tell you something sonny
If I had a horse Id buy it oats
and fuck it

ANTON
Is that right

GRAMS
You can speak freely in front of
Leon dear ‘Hes a few sandwiches
short of a picnic

ANTON
Pickins are pretty slim here huh
Grams
Grams sighs and nods
ANTON

Grams I really need your help I
know you believe in superstitions
and all that dark magic stuff

GRAMS

ANTON

GRAMS
Spit it out dear

ANTON
The Devil is using me as an instrument
of death

LEON
Boys a killer Reba

GRAMS
Hush Leon Anton Im really not
surprised

ANTON

Youre not

GRAMS
The way your parents raised you
letting you sit around on your
duff all day watching TV it makes
perfect sense Did you learn one 7
single constructive thing today in
school

ANTON
Its Sunday Grams

GRAMS
(shaking her head)
Its the old Idle Hands clause
Satan is taking his due

ANTON
What

GRAMS
Idle hands are the Devils play-
ground Anton I dont blame you
of course

ANTON
(frowning)
Thanks

GRAMS
Its your parents fault Youve
always been a very lazy boy and
theyve done nothing to correct it

LEON
Ive always said this younger
generation is lazy You need to
learn discipline and self-control
Whoops soiled myself again

Leon hops out of the room

GRAMS
Hand me the phone Anton Well get
your parents over here and put an
end to this

ANTON
(very quietly pained)
Grams I killed Mom and Dad

GRAMS
Oh dear

ANTON
And my friends and-- Oh no
Grams what if I What if the
Devil makes me kill you too

Anton staggers backward with huge scared eyes

ANTON
I better go

GRAMS
Its okay Anton I have an idea that
just might save you Come here

Anton approaches her reluctantly

INT LIVING ROOM - LATER

The TV is on and Anton is kicked back in his usual spot on
the couch happy as a clam

ANTON
(to the TV)
You tell ‘em Mr Furley

PAN DOWN to reveal Antons hands busily KNITTING About 30
feet of green scarf stretch across the floor

ANTON
(laughing at the TV)
And to think its all just a big
misunderstanding

Suddenly the front door flies open In walk the decomposing
bodies of Mick Pnub and Jimmy their death wounds gaping
Jimmy holds his head in one hand and his heart -- still

attached to his innards by a vein -- in the other
ANTON
(leaping to his feet)
Stay back
MICK
Relax Were not here to kill you
ANTON
Are you bringing another message from
Satan
PNUB

No we just need a place to kick it
The three corpses plop down on Antons couch

MICK
Turns out we didnt make the cut
Heaven or Hell Were fully border-
line

PNUB
So now were in limbo until we avenge
our deaths

ANTON
(backing up against the TV)
I knew it You guys are gonna smite
me

MICK
Dammit Anton calm down We like
limbo Its cool we get to just hang
out No school no jobs nothings
expected of us

JIMMYS HEAD
Anton youre blocking the TV Jacks
about to accuse Janet of being a dyke

Jimmy holds his head out to the side to can see around Anton

ANTON
Youre lying You guys came from hell
Why else would you bring a message from
Satan

MICK
He knew we were coming back to Earth
so he stops me on the way and asks me
to do him a favor What am I gonna
say No

PNUB
Yeah why would we go to Hell Were
not evil I mean its not like were
good or anything but at least we dont
go around killing people

ANTON
Hey fuck you I didn’t kill anyone
on purpose

MICK
So you knit now

Anton looks down at the knitting needles in his hands
Theyre idle He immediately starts knitting again

ANTON
Yeah my grandmother broke it down
for me Idle hands are the Devils
playground I have to keep my hands
busy

MICK
Anton I dont think that saying is
meant literally Its more you know

PNUB
Metaphorical

MICK
Right

ANTON

(shaking his head)
My hands are the only things I have
trouble controlling The rest of
me responds to my brain just fine
The knitting keeps my hands occupied
while freeing my mind up for other
stuff

Anton squeezes onto the couch with the guys and starts
watching TV knitting away Mick fishes the bong out from
under the couch and lights up

EXT ANTONS HOUSE -- SAME

A cop car pulls up Ruck and McMacy hop out and sneak around
the side of the house

RUCK
Lets see what our boys up to

They peek in a window and GASP as they see Anton knitting
next to three motionless open-mouthed corpses Jimmys head
rests on his lap

Ruck and McMacy duck down

RUCK
Holy shit Antons the killer

McMACY
(standing)
We better call for back-up

RUCK
(pulling McMacy back down)
Hold on a sec If we bring him in
ourselves well be heros

McMACY
Yeah But can we do that I mean
we cant break in there without a
warrant

RUCK
Piss on the Bill of Rights Weve
got just cause There are three dead
kids in there one of ‘em missing a
head Nobodys gonna fault us for
bringing that sicko to justice

McMACY
Okay lets do it

RUCK
One more thing Thats kid is obviously
a Grade-A psychc Dont feel compelled
to bring him in alive

McMACY
I never do

The cops draw their guns and creep toward the front door

INT ANTONS LIVINGROOM -- SAME

The four kids sit glassy-eyed on the couch staring through a
haze of pot smoke at the TV as Ruck and McMacy kick the
door in guns pointed at Antons head

RUCK
Freeze

Anton jumps up The other three dont even twitch Anton
looks at the cops and then glances wildly around the room in
a trapped panic

ANTON
Guys Whats should I do
PNUB
(turning)
I think--
McMACY

(shooting Pnub in the head)
Aaahhhh

PNUB
(rubbing his new bullet wound)
I was gonna say I think you should
do what the officers tell you but
I changed my mind

MICK
Really man Just kill ‘em

McMACY
(bewildered)
Theyre alive

RUCK
They are not You just shot one in
the head And that ones head isnt
even attached Theyre obviously
zombies or something

ANTON
(to the boys)
Look I dont want to kill anybody
Well anybody else at least

JIMMYS HEAD
You dont want to go to jail though

ANTON
Jail Thats it Ill give myself
up and theyll put me in a rubber room
where I cant hurt anyone
(to the cops)
Here cuff me

Anton holds his hands out in front of him continuing to
knit Ruck holsters his gun and pulls out his handcuffs
McMacy keeps his gun trained on Anton

RUCK
Okay now drop the knitting needles

ANTON
Believe me thats not a good idea
Just cuff me already

But as Ruck reaches out to slap the cuffs on Anton SPEARS
Rucks hand with one knitting needie and THRUSTS the other
needle through the underside of Rucks jaw up into his
brain

Lightening-quick Anton spins Rucks body around using it as
a shield as McMacy FIRES his first shot

As bullets spray the dead cops chest Anton pulls Rucks gun
from its holster and SHOOTS McMacy right between the eyes

Mick Pnub and Jimmy applaud Anton drops Rucks body

ANTON
(distressed)
Stop that It wasnt me I had no
control over my hands The fucking
knitting didnt help at all

MICK
See I told you that saying was
metaphorical

ANTON

Oh shit

He points the gun at the cop corpses in a panic The dead
boys look at him puzzled

ANTON
Ruck and McMacy are gonna try to
avenge their deaths now Stand back

PNUB
Their asses went straight to Hell
Anton Heaven frowns on dirty cops

MICK
Didnt you see those little black
demons whisk their souls away

Anton shakes his head

MICK
(to Pnub and Jimmy)
Maybe you gotta be dead to see that

As Pnub and Jimmy agree Anton throws the gun down and stares
at his hands distraught

ANTON
What the fuck am I going to do
Satan obviously isnt going to let
me turn myself in
(a beat then--)
I know

He marches into the kitchen The guys haul themselves off
the couch and follow him

INT KITCHEN -- SAME

Anton grabs the still-bloody knife and pulls out the cutting
board He lays his right hand on the cutting board and
RAISES THE KNIFE with his left

MICK
Oh no way

ANTON
Its the only thing I can think of

1 JIMMYS HEAD
I cant watch

Jimmy turns his head to face his own gaping chest

Anton grits his teeth raises the knife high in the air and
SWINGS it down The knife STOPS in mid-air less than an
inch above his right wrist

PNUB
(relieved)
I knew you wouldnt do it

ANTON
(struggling to push
the knife down)
Its not me Satans trying to stop
me

Anton shuts his eyes and concentrates trying with all his
might to force the knife down but it WONT BUDGE

Finally he jumps into the air using the entire weight of
his body to press down on the back of the knife forcing it
THROUGH HIS WRIST and bringing it to a satisfying THWACK
against the cutting board

Anton SCREAMS like a man who just cut his own hand off He
lifts his right arm

Not only is blood spewing out fast and thick but his hand is
still PARTIALLY ATTACHED to his wrist It DANGLES by a
thread

MICK
Oh sick

Anton grimacing in incredible agony grabs his right hand
and JERKS IT OFF

He SCREAMS even louder this time He grips his bloody stump
and falls to the floor in pain

PNUB
That looks bad You should really
put something on it

Mick grabs a small kitchen towel wraps it around Antons
stump and secures it with a rubberband

MICK
Thatll stop the bleeding but how
the hell are you planning to cut off
your other hand

Anton frowns Holding the knife in his left hand he makes a
few backwards slashing attempts but doesnt even come close
to reaching his left wrist

He tries to position the knife above his wrist with his right
arm but he cant push it through He turns to the guys

ANTON
Mick be a bud and cut off my hand

MICK
(shaking his head)
Too gross

ANTON
Pnub

Pnub shakes his head too

ANTON
Cmon Jimmy Please

Jimmys head dry-heaves

ANTON
Fine Fuck you guys then

Leaning over Anton lays his left hand on the floor nudges
the knife up onto his wrist and tries to push it through
with his FOOT -- but the blade just keeps falling sideways

He doggedly goes back to the cutting board He grips the
knife in his TEETH and bobs his head up and down over his
arm but can only make pathetic little scratches

MICK
(gently)
I really dont think self-mutilations
the answer here Anton I mean youre
dealing with Satan -- no matter what you
do hell find a way to fuck with you

Anton suddenly spits the knife out and clutches his towel-
wrapped stump wincing hard

PNUB
You okay

ANTON

(in agony)

The pains really starting to kick in

He holds his arm tight against his chest sqeeezing his eyes
shut and breathing hard as

the tip of a shiny double-edged BLADE pokes through the
bloody towel EXTENDING from Antons wrist Anton SCREAMS
but he doesnt see the blade growing wickedly upward heading
for the soft underside of his chin

The guys GASP

MICK
Anton look out

Antons eyes spring open as Mick grabs his arm pulling the
blades tip away As Anton stares in horror the knife
continues to GROW straight out of his stump When it reaches
a foot long it stops and glints evilly

ANTON
Jesus

MICK
I knew you couldnt outsmart Satan

JIMMYS HEAD
At least you can cut your other hand
off now

They all look at Jimmy

JIMMYS HEAD
If you still want to I mean

PNUB
Look at that fucking thing Its gonna
get infected for sure

MICK
Anton you got any antiseptic

ANTON
(in shock)
I dont know

MICK
Dont worry Ive got a first-aid kit
at my house Well just hop over and
grab it

PNUB
You wait here Anton Try not to move
or youll lose more blood Well be
right back to fix you up

ANTON
(dazed)
Okay

The guys take off and Anton is left alone in the kitchen He
starts to bury his face in his hands but thinks the better
of it and buries his face in just his left hand

On the floor below the cutting board Antons DISMEMBERED
HAND lies in a pool of blood Suddenly a FINGER TWITCHES

Antons face is still hidden as his right hand starts INCHING
slowly toward him

Undetected the hand crawls up his pantleg and onto his
shirt but when the hand brushes against the bare skin at the
base of Antons neck Anton looks down

Before Anton can react the hand has him by the throat He
falls back against the floor struggling for breath and
pulling at the hand with his left hand

He cant budge the hand It SQUEEZES TIGHTER Antons face
goes pale as he tries to wheeze The hands knuckles turn
white squeezing hard

Anton works his blade-appendage between the hand and his
throat Cutting his neck badly in the process Anton manages
to pry the hand loose

With one hard jerk he sends the hand flying It smacks
against the fridge and falls to the floor MOTIONLESS

From out of nowhere CHILLINGLY SINISTER LAUGHTER erupts

As Anton glances around the room in a panic searching for
the source of the laughter the hand SPRINGS back up and
flies at him as a FIST It PUNCHES Anton in the jaw

He reels back punch-drunk too dazed to resist as the hand
grabs Antons left wrist and sets it on the cutting board
The evil hand seizes the knife Anton used earlier and RAISES
IT above Antons left wrist as

the DOORBELL RINGS

‘Anton snapsout of his daze and pulls his left arm away just
as the evil hand THWACKS the knife against the cutting board

The doorbell rings again

MOLLY (OS)
(calling)
Anton
ANTON
Shit

He goes to look at his watch but its still wrapped around
the severed wrist -- FLYING through the air knife pointed at
Antons face

Anton blocks it with his own blade As they SWORDFIGHT

MOLLY (OS)
Anton Are you home

VOICE FROM NOWHERE
(sinister whisper)
Molly isnt it Anton

Antons eyes widen in fear

ANTON
Dont hurt her I11 do whatever
you want just dont hurt her

VOICE FROM NOWHERE
(sinister whisper)
Im not going to hurt her

Anton looks sick He eyes his severed hand with new dread
The doorbell RINGS again

ANTON
(yelling)
Molly get the fuck out of here
you bitch

The evil hand pushes its knife hard against Antons blade
backing Anton up against the counter Beyond it Anton can
see DOWN THE HALL into the entry way -- Mollys pressing her
face against the frosted glass trying to look inside

MOLLY
Anton quit being cute and let me in

Anton struggles to shove the hands knife back but the hand
is stronger It forces Antons own double-edged blade to
press against his face It BREAKS THE SKIN on his cheek and
blood trickles down

EXT ANTONS FRONT PORCH -- SAME

Mollys dressed in a nuns habit A wooden cross sticks
straight out from her chest and blood glistens around the
fake wound

MOLLY
Dammit Anton were late Im
coming in
INT KITCHEN -— SAME

The knife presses deeper into his face

ANTON
No Stay out Molly I mean it

EXT ANTONS FRONT PORCH -- SAME

Molly tries the doorknob The door swings open easily
having been kicked in earlier by the cops She steps inside
INT LIVING ROOM -- SAME

Molly steps over the two cop corpses with a puzzled look
STRANGE SOUNDS can be heard from the kitchen

INT KITCHEN - SAME

Anton reaches to the side with his good hand and pulls a PAN
out of the sink He gives the evil hand a good WHACK
knocking the knife from its grasp

While the hand is momentarily stunned Anton grabs it and
SHOVES it into a ceramic Cookie Monster COOKIE JAR

Holding the cookie jar shut between his chest and right arm
he pulls rubberbands from a drawer and fastens the cookie jar
lid on tight

He sets the cookie jar back on the counter just as Molly
enters She takes in the bloody cutting board bloody knife
bloody floor and bloody Anton with a ANNOYED SIGH
VO
(08
MOLLY
Look you shouldve called You

ANTON
Molly Im the killer

MOLLY
Uh-huh Not real original you know

She reaches out to touch it Anton backs away from her

ANTON
Im not kidding Youve got to get
out of here

MOLLY
Whats up with those dead cops in your
living room They look pretty real
Are they part of your costume

ANTON
Molly listen to me I--

He stops in surprise as his blade arm turns horizontally in
front of him and RAISES itself into the air As Anton stares
at it stunned the blade PULLS him toward Molly

He pulls back with his good hand but its no use His feet
slide across the floor as he struggles to stop himself

ANTON
(coming at her uncontrollably)
Molly run

MOLLY
Save it for the costume judges Can
we go now

As his blade reaches her throat Anton shoves Molly back with
his good hand trying to keep her out of cutting range Up
against the back door she rolis her eyes

MOLLY
(unenthused )
Fine Help help The killers
got me

But the blade closes in on her despite Antons efforts It
presses against her throat

MOLLY
Anton quit it That hurts

ANTON
(struggling)
Im trying I cant help it

She tries to push him off her but cant He tries to hold
the blade back but cant

ANTON
Im sorry Molly Theres nothing
else I can do

He leans in kisses her and PRESSES HIS OWN THROAT AGAINST
THE BLADE

ANTON
At least Satan wont win

In one swift movement he jerks his head sideways SLITTING
his own THROAT

Everything goes BLACK

INT WINNEBAGO - EVENING

Debi pours Hot Train a dish of birdseed The parrot hops
wordlessly onto the edge of the dish and eats flinging seed
and shells everywhere

DEBI
(disgruntled)
Not even a thank you

EXT PARKING LOT - SAME
Debi steps out The motor home is parked beneath the neon

coffee-cup shaped sign of THE HOTCAKE HOUSE Debi slams the
Winnebago door

DEBI
Dumb bird
She stalks into the diner as a blue Chevy Nova -- carrying
Devon Joe and Curtis -- cruises into the lot blasting

Motley Crues Shout At the Devil
Jo

INT ANTONS KITCHEN -- SAME

CLOSE ON Antons slit throat as the gash miraculously seals
itself shut It doesnt look pretty but its obviously
doing the job because Anton sits up dazed

ANTONS POV Everythings blurry He can hear

MOLLY
(shrieking in terror)
Anton Anton help

But he cant see her He shakes his head and focuses on
jagged pieces As his vision sharpens the pieces become
broken cookie jarshards on the floor

Anton turns immediately to see his disembodied hand CHOKING
Molly against the back door Her screams fade she BLACKS
OUT and COLLAPSES onto the floor

VOICE FROM NOWHERE
(sinister whisper)
Ill always win Anton

The spine-chilling laughter fills the room again as Anton
hurls himself toward the unconscious Molly He-lifts his
blade to SPEAR the hand but stops abruptly

On second thought he uses his good hand to bend back the
evil hands fingers one by one He pries the hand loose and
it turns on him bitch-slapping Anton across the face

Anton stumbles back The hand flies at him again but this
time Anton puts his knife-hand up to block it -- and the
hand IMPALES ITSELF on Antons blade

Anton opens the MICROWAVE flings the hand in shuts the
door and turns it on HIGH

The evil hands skin bubbles and then bursts against the
microwave door ina mess of seared flesh and blood

ANTON
Gross

INT HOTCAKE HOUSE - SAME
Devon Joe and Curtis lift their overloaded food trays from

the buffet line and look around the crowded Hotcake House
Every table is occupied

Debi is sitting alone in a booth barely picking at a pizza-
sized pancake Devon gives her his best puppy-dog eyes

DEVON
Excuse me maam Do you mind if
my friends and I share this booth
with you

DEBI
(not looking up)
Ha

Devon Curtis and Joe look at each other and shrug They
slide into Debis booth and begin devouring their food
talking with their mouths full

CURTIS
(to Debi)
Hey you got the pizza-sized pancake
too
Debi doesnt look up
DEVON
Do you live around here
CURTIS
No I live over --
DEVON
Not you dick her
DEBI
(looking up)

You want to know where I live
Devon nods and then adds
DEVON

Not like were loony or anything
We wont stalk you

DEBI
I have no home I dont get to have
a home

JOE

You need a place to crash

DEBI
Let me ask you something How did you
guys spend your day today

JOE
Hungover

CURTIS
And Dev spent hours laying on his back
in the driveway

DEVON
(nodding)
New shocks

DEBI
Ive never had a driveway Ive never
even had a hangover

The guys look at her with pity

DEBI
You know how I spend my days I
drive around the country looking
for the Devil

CURTIS
What are you some kind of freak
Youve really never been hungover

Devon kicks Curtis under the table but Debi ignores them

DEBI
Thats right Satan himself Oh I
know what youre thinking Why would
a clever yet attractive young woman
waste her life away searching for
Satan Because I have to Its my
freaking destiny

Devon Curtis and Joe have no response to that

DEBI

Thats right Im not a religious
zealot or a cultist Evil doesnt
even bother me all that much I just
have absolutely no say in my own life
And heres the kicker

(they stare blankly at her)
I actually have the one thing that
can rid this world of Satan forever
-- On an ancient scroll passed down
through generations of LeCure women -
-- a holy incantation that will
banish the Prince of Darkness to hell

Devon Curtis and Joe shovel food into their mouths
73

DEBI
I know what youre thinking Of course
theres a catch In order to send the
Devil packing I have to read the
incantation to his face

JOE
(pointing at her pancake)
You gonna eat that

DEBI
Help yourself But reading it to his
face is virtually impossible you under-
stand Satan almost never appears on
earth himself He uses humans -- the
weak-minded and slothful -- to do his
dirty work

DEVON
(to be polite)
Why is that anyway Why doesnt he
do it himself

DEBI
Are you kidding Do you have any idea
how hot it is in Hell

The guys shrug

DEBI
Even the hottest places in the world
must be thousands of degrees below
what Satans used to The Devil cant
hack the cold long enough to do much
evil himself

JOE
(skeptical)
He gets too cold

DEVON
Duh Joe Why do you think theres no
crime in Antarctica

(to Debi)
So How does one go about tracking
Satan
DEBI

Ill tell you

She waits for them to egg her on They dont
DEBI
I read the papers and watch the
news When I hear about a deranged
serial killer on the loose odds are
Satans involved I head to that
town in hopes of finding the Devil
before he moves on to the next schmuck

DEVON
Weird Satans like the topic of
the day or something Earlier today
Anton told me Satan was possessing him

Eyes wide Debi ‘reaches across the table ‘and grabs Devon by
his Black Sabbath concert T-shirt

DEBI
Dont screw with me mister

Devon pulls his shirt from Debis grip

DEVON
Ease up there kitten Im telling
you the truth He was pretty freaked

DEBI
Tell me where he lives Now

INT ANTONS KITCHEN -- SAME
Antons checking Mollys pulse -- he finds it

ANTON
Thank God

VOICE FROM NOWHERE
(sinister whisper)
He had nothing to do with it

Anton turns looking around wildly for the source of the
voice but again he finds no one He puts his good hand
protectively on Molly

ANTON
(to the room in general)
What do you want

VOICE FROM NOWHERE
(sinister whisper)
Kill her

ANTON
No

He turns back to Molly in a panic 75

ANTON
Molly Molly wake up You have
to get out of here Molly

He slaps her face gently with his good hand She doesnt
stir

As Anton slaps her harder desperately his knife-hand RISES
at his side Unnoticed it positions itself above Antons
head its vicious point AIMED at Mollys forehead

Anton turns from Molly in despair -- and sees his reflection
on the oven door the blade PLUNGES toward Molly

Anton CATCHES THE BLADE in his good hand just inches from
her face Blood trickles from his fist around the sharp
metal and down his wrist as he jerks himself away

He kicks the back door OPEN and runs out

EXT HOTCAKE HOUSE PARKING LOT - SAME

Debi scrambles into the drivers seat clutching a hand-drawn
MAP on a napkin

jackpot

She peels out On the other side of the restaurant window
Devon Curtis and Joe shake their heads and continue eating

EXT BACKYARD -- SAME

Antons good hand is trashed -- the palm is deeply sliced
Ignoring that he grasps the blade again and PULLS with a
vengeance trying to yank the blade from his stump No
luck

He peeks under the dishtowel -- his stump has FUSED SHUT
around the base of the knife -- its now part of his body
The wound is compltely closed and the blood is gone but its
hideous-looking Anton jerks the dishtowel back into place

ANTON
(yelling enraged)
I will not do this anymore Im going
back inside and calling an ambulance
for Molly
He glances around the dark back yard defiantly waiting for
response Getting none he adds

ANTON
Ya fuck

As he stalks back toward the house a sudden wind comes up
rustling the leaves on the ground and CHILLING Anton to the
bone He stops short

SINISTER WHISPER BEHIND HIM
Oh Anton “

Anton slowly turns -- to find no one He turns back toward
the door and finds himself face-to-chest with THE DEVIL

a

Anton jumps Satan looms over him 8 feet high with horns

tail and forked tongue a deep blood-red On closer
inspection his body is a sea of constantly moving blood
with small wormlike creatures swimming in it

ANTON
(terrified)
Holy shit

SATAN
Youre going back in there alright -—-
to kill her
(moving slowly in on Anton)
See the way it works is youre my
bitch You live to pleasure me

Anton inches away unable to run eyes wide with fright

SATAN
And tonights a big night for you
If you cant get it together to kill
one dumb chick how are you going to
slaughter several hundred of your peers

ANTON
(barely squeaking it out)
Why me
SATAN

You Anton are the result of a
millennium of carefully planned DNA
experimentation Youre the supreme
sinner built to butcher

ANTON
(stunned)
Really

SATAN
Dont be stupid Youre just a
random choice Now listen you have
the perfect set-up tonight

ANTON -
(whimpering)
You dont need me You could do it
yourself Please just let me have
my life back

Jimmy holds his head up to look at the blood and guts in the
microwave

JIMMYS HEAD
Maybe we should clean it first

He rips a paper towel from a roll and places it in the
microwave He sets the frozen burritos in on top of it and
turns the microwave on

Arms crossed over his chest bored out of his mind Satan
taps his fingers on one arm as the WIND PICKS UP

ANTON
(fuming)

SATAN
(shivering in the cold wind)

ANTON

(throwing his hands up)
So what Hell cant be worse than

(realizing something)
And Ive been resisting you If you

Satans eyes blaze with rage He tries to uncross his arms
but his JOINTS have STIFFENED in the cold

Anton looks puzzled as Satan grimaces and forces one stiff
finger to POINT at the ground

A RING OF FIRE springs up around the Devil He moves his
arms and shoulders slowly as his JOINTS WARM and loosen up
Suddenly a strong wind blows the fire out

SATAN
(annoyed shivering again)
Look I dont have time for this
You dont want to be the predator
Fine Lets see how you like being
one of the prey

Anton suddenly SCREAMS and clutches his knife-hand
At the base of the knife BLOOD seeps through the dishtowel
wrapped around his stump Anton HOWLS in intense PAIN

Satans freezing his TEETH CHATTERING in the cold but he
cant leave before basking in Antons agony

SATAN
Youre no longer under my protection
Anton How does it feel

ANTON
(gritting his teeth)
Its worth it

SATAN
(laughing)
You think youve stopped me My plans

Anton races into the front yard and glances around Through
the chain-link fence he sees DEVONS TRUCK parked in the
driveway next door
Just beyond him Debbie s Winnebago is hauling ass toward his
house
INT WINNEBAGO - SAME
As Debi roars into Antons DRIVEWAY she sees Anton hopping

the fence She quickly flips her napkin-map over to reveal a
crude sketch of Antons head

DEBI
Weve got him Hot Train Look out
Satan were right on your ass

She scrambles from the cab to her living room and dives under
the kitchen table spinning the safes combination locks

EXT METAL HOUSE DRIVEWAY - SAME

Devons truck is unlocked Anton yanks the door open and
jumps in
With Hot Train perched on her shoulder Debi hurls herself

out of the Winnebago The ANCIENT SCROLL GLOWS in her hand
as she races around the fence toward him

IN THE TRUCK

No keys Anton shoves the tip of his knife blade into the
trucks ignition and gives it a quick twist But

The base of the blade ROTATES IN HIS STUMP instead of in the
ignition Anton YELPS and rips off the dishtowel -- now
soaked through with blood

No longer fused shut his stump is the gory open wound it
should be -- but with a knife shoved into it

He wiggles the knife -- its slightly LOOSE

Holding it firmly with his good hand Anton WINCES as he
forces the kinife-tip to turn in the ignition

IN THE DRIVEWAY

Just as Debi rushes up the drive yelling --

DEBI
Anton Anton wait

-- the truck ROARS to life

IN THE TRUCK

Twisted Sisters Were Not Gonna Take It” immediately
blasts from the tape deck obliterating the sound of Debis
yelling

Anton throws the truck into reverse

IN THE DRIVEWAY
BAM The back of the truck SLAMS FULL-FORCE INTO DEBI

The SCROLL GOES FLYING and Hot Train flaps his wings like
crazy as Debis shoulder drops out from under him

Debi lands at the edge of the driveway

IN THE TRUCK

Braking Anton looks startled and confused He checks his
rearview mirror Seeing nothing he shrugs and continues
backing out ‘
BAM

One of the back tires goes up and over something

BAM The front tire follows suit

Anton shakes his head and whips the truck onto the street
snapping off the cheesy 80s metal

ANTON
Damn Dev your new shocks suck

Devons creeper rolls in the trucks bed as Anton roars away

IN THE YARD

A few feet from Debis lifeless form the scroll is glowing
softly lodged in a flower bed Using his beak Hot Train
PULLS the SCROLL FREE

DOWN THE BLOCK

Just a few houses away ANTON screeches to a STOP in front of
Mollys house

ACROSS THE STREET

A LITTLE BOY lovingly wraps his arms around Danzigs neck and
looks pleadingly up at his MOTHER

She nods and smiles and the boys face bursts into a huge
grin as they lead Danzig into his new home Danzig bounds in
happily

INT ANTONS’ KITCHEN — SAME

Mick PLUNGES a FORK pronged-side up into the top of Jimmys”
pulpy neck ‘He takes Jimmys head off the counter and SLAMS
it down onto the fork bringing head and neck together again

Pnub pokes Jimmys forehead The head wobbles slightly

PNUB
Still a little loose

Mick finds a roll of duct tape in a drawer and wraps it
around Jimmys neck TAPING his head on tight-

MICK
Lift your arms

Jimmy holds his arms away from his chest His heart falls
out dangling by an entrail Pnub shoves Jimmys innards
back in as Mick DUCT TAPES him shut

The guys head out of Anton’s house Hot Train hops across
the yard toward them with the ANCIENT SCROLL clutched safely
in his beak

Micks eyes light up He points excitedly at the Winnebago
in the driveway motor still running

MICK
No way How convenient

They walk right past Hot Train and the scroll and open the
Winnebago doors

Hot Train flies up into a tree and TEARS THE SCROLL TO
SHREDS lining his new nest with glowing bits

Lame Halloween decorations deck the walls Costumed
TEENAGERS mill about as a BAND PLAYS an horrible pointless
cover of Kenny Loggins Danger zone on the stage and a few
adult CHAPERONES lean against the walls

Molly enters in her nuns outfit and her friend TANYA joins
her at the punch table

TANYA

Plunged into Moliys chest)

CUT TO
Another part of the gym A bored adult CHAPERONE stands
guard at a doorway He hears a NOISE and looks behind hin
peering into the dark hallway
A lightening-fast skeletal HAND JABS him through the eyes
boring into his brain The chaperones SCREAM is drowned out
by the BANDs deafening song-ending climax
BACK AT THE PUNCH TABLE
JIMMY

This band sucks
CUT TO
An UNSEEN FORCE drags the dead chaperone into the dark
hallway
BACK AT THE PUNCH TABLE

Jimmy turns from the band to see Tanya deeply french-kissing
Micks decomposing mouth

Pnub pries Mick away from Tanya
PNUB
Cmon man youre dead Think

Mick shrugs
MOLLY
(sighing)

As she disappears through the door left unguarded by the now-
dead chaperone

Anton bursts into the gym his stump bloodier than ever and

mushy with DECOMPOSING FLESH around the knife
ANTON
(yelling)
Stop the dance
The band crashes to a halt and all eyes turn to Anton

ANTON
Im the killer

A sea of Jasons Freddies Mansons and Nightstalkers stare

at him for just a second before going back to their
conversations The band resumes playing

Anton runs onstage grabbing the microphone from the singer

The band stops again

ANTON
(into the mic)
Im not fucking around

CHAPERONE
Hey watch your language

ANTON
Im not messing around Youre all
in danger here Go home The devils
coming to kill you all

The student body scoffs

ANTON
Really He already made me kill
my parents a couple of cops and
Mick Pnub and Jimny

The crowd turns collectively toward the punch table where
Jimmy is emptying a BEER into the punchbowl Anton looks

stunned to see them there as the three dead boys wave at the

crowd

MICK
Its true

JIMMY
(hiding the beer bottle)
Yeah he sliced me up real good

The crowd laughs dismissively turning away from Anton

Deflated he hands the mic to the singer and mopes over to

the punch table

ANTON
Stupid idiots Theyre all gonna
die and theres nothing I can do
about it

MICK
Uh-huh

JIMMY
At least theyll get to live it
up before theyre systematically
slaughtered thanks to me

He slides another beer from his pocket and pops the cap off
with the bottle-opener on his keychain Anton stares at the
KEYCHAIN as Jimmy pours the beer into the punch

PNUB
You cant spike punch with beer
dipshit Like the whole school is
gonna get drunk because you added
a beer or two to that bowl

JIMMY

Jimmy pops another beer open as Anton continues to focus on
the keychain Suddenly--

ANTON

Molly stops at a water fountain leaning over to drink when
she hears

VOICE FROM NOWHERE
Molly

MOLLY
(jerking up)
What

Silence Frowning she wipes water droplets off her mouth
and looks around A little ways down the hall a LIGHT
FLICKS ON inside a classroom The door is slightly ajar

Molly slowly cautiously approaches the classroom A sign on
the door reads SHOP ROOM

She steps in The door SLAMS shut behind her
MOLLY (0S)
(piercing scream)
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhh

a huge metal MACHINE through the meat warehouse toward an
open door
EXT MEAT-PACKING PLANT - SAME
Devons truck is parked beside the building below the sign

WARDEN MEATS The warehouse door is open and Jimmys keys
dangle from the lock

On the side of the meat-packing plant a silver industrial
garage door slides up and open with a CLANG

The massive machine -- with FREEZE-WHIZ 4000 painted on the
side -- is balanced precariously on the little creeper from
Devons truck

Steadying the Freeze-Whiz and pushing from behind Anton
grunts with effort

As he rolls the machine toward the truck a sudden wind comes
up Anton shivers in the breeze and

HEARS a SCRAPING SOUND He cocks his head and listens-
Nothing He peers over the top of the Freeze-Whiz Nothing

Then the sound comes again -- SCRAPE SCRAPE Its
coming from behind him He very very slowly turns to look
over his shoulder

and sees nothing

Grimly holding his knife-hand at the ready and keeping a
sharp suspicious look-out he continues on toward the truck

INT SCHOOL HALLWAY - SAME

Mick Pnub and Jimmy creep cautiously down the dark hallway
They HEAR SOMETHING

JIMMY
Did you hear something

PNUB
Yeah It sounded like flesh being
ripped off

MICK
We better check it out

Mick starts forward but Pnub and Jimmy hesitate
MICK
Quit being pussies Its not like
were gonna get killed again
They move covertly down the hall and the FLESHY NOISES get

LOUDER They round a corner and see FIGURES lurching in the
shadows

Jimmy grabs one of the figures and pulls it into the light
- its a costumed TEENAGED GIRL and Jimmys holding onto
her by the boobs

GIRL
Let go fucker

Before Jimmy can react the girls BOYFRIEND steps out of the
shadows and PUNCHES Jimmy in the face

Jimmys head FLIES OFF and rolls down the hall His body
just stands there with a fork sticking out of his neck

The girl SCREAMS and runs away Her boyfriend SCREAMS and -
runs after her

The guys shrug Jimmy retrieves his head and they continue
the search down the hallway past the closed Shop door

INT SHOP ROOM - SAME

CLOSE ON Mollys chest as the WOODEN CROSS is yanked out of
her nuns habit by an unseen hand We dont see her face
she doesnt resist

CLOSE ON A whirring industrial-strength SANDING MACHINE
The blunt end of the cross is held to it by the same unseen
hand and the powerful sander quickly files it into a SHARP

POINT

INT GYMDANCE - SAME

No one notices as each set of the gyms double doors open to
the parking lot CLOSE SILENTLY seemingly of their own
accord

EXT SCHOOL PARKING LOT - SAME

Devons truck is parked at a reckless angle in the lot
Anton wheels the Freeze-Whiz on the creeper up to the
closed gymnasium doors

The horrible band can be heard covering The Eye of the
Tiger as Anton tugs on a door handle The door wont budge

Puzzled he pushes the machine around a corner of the school
and finds a single door - UNLOCKED Victorious he wheels
the Freeze-Whiz in
INT POOL ROOM - SAME

In the weird blue light of the deserted swimming pool Anton
goes to plug the Freeze-wWhiz into a wall outlet but before
he gets there

A quiet CREAK is barely audible from across the room Anton
whirls around to inspect the room -- a door is OPEN at the
far end

Anton frowns at it hesitating -- was it open when he came
in But nothing moves Even the water is still Shrugging
he plugs in the Freeze-Whiz It powers up with a LOUD ROAR

ACROSS THE ROOM

The open door slams SHUT but Anton cant hear it -- or
anything else -- over the WHIR of the Freeze-Whiz

UNIDENTIFIED POV

Somethings in the room with Anton His back is turned hes
fiddling with the Freeze-Whizs temperature dial as it
APPROACHES him stealthily Whatever it is its practically
breathing down Antons neck when he TURNS

Anton JUMPS startled and then looks relieved

ANTON
Molly God Im glad to see you

Mollys standing in front of him hands OUT OF SIGHT behind
her back She smiles

ANTON
I want to apologize for you know
earlier Hey guess what though
Im not the killer anymore so you
dont have to worry

MOLLY
(still smiling)
Im not worried

ANTON
Good ‘cause youve gotta understand
that Im not really like that Im
nice guy

As he rambles we PAN DOWN behind Molly to reveal the
SHARPENED CROSS clutched behind her back

ANTON
Thanks for being so cool about this
You have no idea what its like to--

Molly brings the cross up over her head and PLUNGES it toward
Antons skull He scrambles out of the way just in time

ANTON
Jesus Christ I guess you do know
what its like

He backs away as Molly advances

ANTON
Molly you dont know what youre
doing I werit through that stage
too Youve got to try and clear
your head

Molly stabs at him again but Anton blocks her cross with his
blade hand slightly CUTTING HER HAND in the process

MOLLY
(screaming)

She clutches her cut hand in pain

ANTON
(going to her)
Im sorry

Molly BURIES the cross in Antons shoulder He howls as she
pulls it out and stabs at him again This time he moves
before the cross finds its mark

ANTON
(backing up against the
high dive ladder)
Molly listen to me Ive got a
plan to defeat Satan Your part
is easy All you have to do is not
kill me

Shes inching toward him not listening With his back
pressed against the ladder theres nowhere to go but up
Anton climbs up a step

INT POOL ROOM — SAME

Molly and Anton are up on the HIGH DIVE Molly LUNGES
Anton SLIPS falling flat on his back She looms over him
brandishing her cross as

the HAND flies into the room with blood dripping from its
skeletal fingers It beelines straight for the Freeze-Whiz
and SHUTS IT OFF

Anton hears the machine sputter and go quiet He turns his
head to look and Molly STABS him in the shoulder again
Anton SCREAMS

Mick Pnub and Jimmy come into the pool room

MICK
(pointing)
Theres that hand

JIMMY
(holding his head onto his
neck with both hands) ae
Hey thats my Dads Freeze-Whiz 4000

ANTON
Guys Guys

The guys look around the room confused On the diving
board Molly stabs at Antons chest He blocks it with his
blade -- but the impact LOOSENS the knife even more and Anton
winces with pain as the knifes base WOBBLES in his stump

He grabs Mollys wrist in his good hand and holds it still

MICK
Anton

ANTON
Up here

They look up at the high dive

ANTON
(grappling with Molly)
You guys have got to turn that Freeze-
Whiz back on Its the only way to
beat Satan

The guys eye the machine The skeletal hand guards it like a
pitbull

MICK
Sure thing buddy

As the three guys march toward the hand the horde of
costumed students enter the pool room

BOYFRIEND
Thats the kid whose head I punched
off

The guys close in on the hand and Jimmy lets go of his head -
to lunge at it

The hand smacks Jimmys hands away jostling his head
Jimmys head flies off his neck and rolls close enough to
CATCH THE HAND in his TEETH

MICK
Yeah fuck it up Jimmy Bite it
again

But as Jimmy opens up to bite again the hand CRAWLS INSIDE
HIS MOUTH and OUT the bottom where his throat should be The
hand grabs Jimmys head by the hair and TOSSES it into the

pool

PNUB
Dont worry man Ill get you
Mick you cover the hand

Pnub grabs a long pole with a net on the end to fish Jimmys
head out of the pool as Mick dives at the skeletal hand

ON THE HIGH DIVE

Still on his back Anton holds Mollys cross-jabbing wrist
with his one good hand as she leans over him

ANTON
Molly I cant defend myself without
hurting you You have to clear your
mind If you resist Satanll show
up and we can beat him

He brings his pleading face up close to hers She squirms
trying to wrench her wrist from his grasp

ANTON
You can do it Molly

She snarls evilly at him

ANTON
Please For me

He kisses her softly on the lips Suddenly her eyes fill
with tears

Anton lets go and watches holding his breath as Molly
convulses struggling with herself Her hand holding the
cross starts to move toward Anton but Molly flights to hold
it back

Summoning all her strength she forces her fingers to LET GO
of the cross It clatters onto the diving board and she
collapses on top of Anton
ANTON
(hugging her)
Yes I knew youd come through Molly

A split-second later Satan appears on the high dive
blocking their way to the ladder

SATAN
You big fat fucking idiot Anton
BELOW

The costumed students stare up at Satan in amazement and

fear Pnub continues trying to fish Jimmys head out of the

pool but it keeps bobbing away Mick has his hands full

fighting the skeletal hand

ON THE HIGH DIVE

Grimacing in pain Anton uses his good hand to keep the base
of his knife pressed into his stump trying to stop it from

wobbling around as he points it defensively at Satan

SATAN
Whats the big plan Youre gonna
make me cold

ANTON
(nervous but defiant)
Thats right

He starts to sit up but Satan plants a massive foot on
Antons chest forcing him to lie back down

SATAN
Even if your stupid friends manage
to turn that thing on you think
Ill be helpless
BELOW
The girl tugs on her boyfriends arn

GIRL
Lets go

The boyfriend nods and they start toward the door The rest

of the kids follow

- SATAN
You cant imagine the extent of
my power All Ihave to do is
point my finger and BAM Fire

Satan points his finger and BAM A wall of fire appears at
the door blocking it from the girl and her boyfriend They
jump back and in a panic the whole crowd rushes for the
door to the hallway

Laughing Satan points his finger again and the hall door is
consumed in fire

SATAN
Nobody leaves

ANTON
(holding Molly close)
Weve already won We resisted you

SATAN -

Yeah congrats Guess what you win
a brand-new fiery death You twoll
burn along with everyone else here

(to the crowd)
You can all thank Anton for your
early demise

(to Anton)

other town long ago

Satan laughs as the entire student body glares at Anton

GUY IN CROWD
Nice goin Anton

GIRL IN CROWD

ACROSS THE ROOM

Mick forces the hand to the ground and STEPS ON IT He grins
as he hears each bony finger BREAK He holds the bent
gnarled thing up with satisfaction and

MICK
(turning the Freeze-whiz on)
Anton your gizmos back on

The Freeze-Whiz ROARS to life once again On the high dive
Anton cranes his neck to see giving Mick a quick thumbs-up

ANTON
Yes
(narrowing his eyes at Satan)
Now youre done for

Satan rolls his eyes as the crowd CHEERS

Pnub finally scoops Jimmys head into the net but as he
turns with it the end of the pole smacks into the Freeze-
Whiz KNOCKING the machine into a corner of the POOL

SATAN
(laughing his ass off)
Thats just perfect

Anton sadly watches the Freeze-Whiz sink to the bottom of the
pool

- » but he also notices something else the water around
the machine starts to FREEZE

ANTON
(to Satan)
Laugh it up Fucko

He grabs Satan by the ankles and plants his foot firmly in
the Devils crotch In one swift movement he heaves Satan
over’ himself and Molly and OFF THE END OF THE DIVING BOARD
The crowd CHEERS again but Satan just LAUGHS as he plummets

In the pool ICE is SPREADING rapidly out from the Freeze-
Whiz heading toward the middle of the pool

In mid-fall Satan extends his TONGUE upward WRAPPING IT
around ANTONS THROAT and YANKING HIM OVER THE EDGE TOO

The crowd GASPS

sticking out -- as Anton struggles tugging
aroun fis throat

The water instantly FREEZES SOLID OVER HIM

A split-second later Anton SLAMS AGAINST THE HARD ICE with a
bone-shattering smack His knife knocked completely out of
his stump by the impact goes spinning across the ice

Anton doesnt move

MICK
Oh shit

MOLLY
(scrambling down the ladder)
Anton Oh my god Anton

JIMMY

The crowd stares in silent horror as Mick Pnub and Jimmy
slide across the ice toward their buddy -

but before they can reach Anton the boys bodies COLLAPSE
Three transparent SOULS RISE from the corpses

MICKS SOUL
(to Pnub)
Nice move dickhead I think you

The three boys spirits VANISH as Molly rushes frantically
across the frozen pool She frees Antons throat from
Satans tongue and kisses him

He doesnt move
