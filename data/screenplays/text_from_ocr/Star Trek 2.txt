Another hit reverberating flashes of spark and flame
on the bridge Spock dies Bones comes to him but
even as he coughs his way through the smoke a final
hit and Bones falls The room is smoke filled and a
shambles Saavik looks about in shock

head

SAAVIK
Any suggestions Admiral

do not take prisoners

SPOCK

Sulu awakens with a grin Uhura straightens herself

demurely The Trainees head toward the distant room
Spock rises and leaves Bones remains on the floor

head propped in his hand whimsically

KIRK
Physician heal thyself

BONES
Thats all you have to say

KIRK
Im not a drama critic

Bones rolls his eyes and rises Kirk sees Saavik who
has not moved
KIRK
(continuing)
Well Mr Saavik are you going
to stay with the sinking ship

SAAVIK

Permission to speak candidly sir
KIRK

Very well
SAAVIK

(fights emotion)
I dont believe this was a fair
test of my command capabilities

KIRK

And why not
SAAVIK

Because there was no way to win
KIRK

A no-win situation is a possibility
every commander may face Has that
never occurred to you

SAAVIK
No sir It has not

KIRK
How we deal with death is at least
as important as how we deal with
life wouldnt you say

SAAVIK
(falters)
As I indicated Admiral that
thought had not occurred to me

KIRK
Then you have something new to think
about Carry on

She stays at attention
BONES
Wouldnt it be easier to put
an experienced crew back on the
ship

KIRK
Theyll learn Galloping about the
cosmos is a game for the young
doctor

He leaves They look at each other

UHURA
(offended)
What is that supposed to mean

HOLD ON Saavik
INT CORRIDOR OUTSIDE THE SIMULATOR ROOM - DAY

Kirk rounds the corner and sees Spock leaning against
the wall

KIRK

(dry)
Arent you dead

Spock almost smiles

KIRK
(continuing)
I assume you are loitering here
to learn what efficiency rating
I plan to give your cadets

SPOCK
I am understandably curious

They walk together

KIRK
They destroyed the simulator room
and you with it

SPOCK
The Kobayshi Maru scenario
frequently wreaks havoc with
students and equipment

(dry)
As I recall you took the test
three times yourself Your final
solution was shall we say unique

KIRK
(solemn )
It had the virtue of never having
been tried

SPOCK
Yours was not a solution which
would have occurred to a Vulcan
mentality

KIRK
So you said at the time Speaking
of which your protgs first
rare -- a trifle emotional --

SPOCK
Shes half Romulan Jim The
admixture makes her more volatile
than -- me for example

KIRK
Than you Yes I see that By
the way thank you for this

He lifts the book

SPOCK
I know of your fondness for antiques

KIRK

(reads )

It was the best of times it was
the worst of times Message
Spock

SPOCK
None of which I am consciously
aware -- except of course happy
birthday -- surely the best of times

Kirk looks around uncomfortably overlaps

KIRK
Hrummm and where are you off
to now
SPOCK
The Enterprise I must check in
before your inspection And you

KIRK
(shortly)
Home
Spock studies him --
SPOCK

Something oppresses you
They are old friends --

KIRK

Spock watches wiping the scene

TERRELL
Damn Are you sure Maybe the

INT KIRKS APARTMENT TERRA - NIGHT 11

Kirk reads the novel trying to focus His flat befits
an Admiral and a loner with few possessions except
a collection of antiques

WE HEAR A SOFT BONG
Startled Kirk lowers the book and pushes a button

KIRK
Come

The door slides open and Bones enters He carries two
packages one of them wrapped in brown paper

KIRK
(continuing)
Bless me doctor and what beams
you into this neck of the woods

BONES
Beware Romulans bearing gifts
Happy Birthday

With a flourish he pulls out a bottle of blue
liquid

KIRK
Romulan Ale Bones you know
this stuff is illegal --

BONES
(broad)
I only use it for medicinal
purposes Dont be a pring

KIRK
(reading the label
with difficulty)
Twenty-two eighty-three
BONES
Takes the stuff a while to
ferment Gimme

He takes the bottle and pours continues talking

BONES
(continuing)
Now open the other one

Kirk starts to obey

KIRK
Im almost afraid to What did
you bring me contraband Klingon --

BONES
More antiques for your collection
-- Cheers

They drink The package is opened a pair of gold
Ben Franklin half-glasses (NB Romulan Ale is
an INSTANT DRUNK both men react)

KIRK
Cheers Bones these are charming

BONES
Four hundred years old You dont
find many with the lens still

intact
KIRK
Uh -- what are they
BONES

For your eyes For most patients

of your age I generally administer
Retlax Five to restore flexibility
of the lens

KIRK
But Im allergic to Retlax

BONES
Exactly Happy birthday

He toasts Kirk is unsure how they work
BONES
(continuing)
Slide them down your nose Now look
at me over the top And you read
printed matter through the bottom

KIRK
(reacts)
Amazing I dont know what to say --

BONES
Say thank you
KIRK
Thank you
An awkward silence
BONES

Damn it Jim what the hells the
matter Other people have birthdays
Whyre we treating yours like a funeral

KIRK
Bones I dont want to be lectured

BONES
What DO you want Damn it why
isnt there a girl here You know
this has nothing to do with age
This is about you flying a goddamn
computer console when you wanna be
out hopping Galaxies

KIRK
Spare me your notions of poetry
please We all have our assigned
duties and

behind the rules and regulations --

KIRK
And who am I hiding from

BONES
From yourself Admiral

Pause Kirk pours another drink
KIRK
Dont mince words Bones tell

filtered are hard to make out

With the TRICORDER to guide them they set out

is ahead of Chekov on a slight rise --

CHEKOV
Theres nothing lets go --

ANGLE 17
Terrell waves him frantically forward As Chekov

moves up we rise with him to the top of the ridge and

look down

ANGLE - THEIR POV 18
A RUINED SERIES OF MAN-MADE STRUCTURES half buried in

sand They look at each other in consternation Chekov

is worried something about all this is familiar

They descend towards the structures now seen to be the
wreckage of some sort of space craft

They pass but do not notice the FEDERATION LOGO half
buried next to their feet

TERRELL
They look like cargo carriers

As Chekov looks at the porthole a face suddenly looks
back It is the face of a CHILD The Apparition

scares the daylights out of Chekov -- and us He
screams
TERRELL
(continuing)

What is it
He comes clumsily over --
CHEKOV
A face I saw -- it was like a
child --
He points The porthole is empty

TERRELL
Youre crazy --

CHEKOV
I saw it --

TERRELL
Theres an air-lock

He points and they go into the airlock

rigged -- but no people Terrell checks a monitor
TERRELL

Theres breathable atmosphere in here
He takes off his helmet Chekov likewise

crash Wheres the rest of the

They wander as they talk picking up objects that be-
speak a fairly sophisticated ad hoc environment a

filled with disgusting CETI EELS

On its side in the sand the walls are now the floor
etc All in crookedness -- like its owner On the

time

INT CARGO HOLD - CETI ALPHA V
Terrell and Chekov are held by FOUR STRONG MEN
They seem to be waiting One of the men is JOACHIM

Out of the airlock steps a tall masked figure A
moment of suspense as Terrell and Chekov watch terri-
fied The mask is peeled back

CHEKOV
(aloud despite himself)
Khan

KHAN is startled by the recognition comes over and
examines Chekov and Terrell

KHAN
(finally)
I dont know you But you I never
forget a face Mister Chekov
isnt it

(wonderingly)

I never thought to see your face
again

TERRELL
Chekov who is this man

CHEKOV
A criminal Captain -- a product of
the late 20th Century genetic
engineering --

TERRELL

What do you want with us I demand --

KHAN
(mild)
You are in a position to demand

nothing sir I on the other hand

am in a position to grant nothing
What you see is all that remains of
the ships company and the crew of the
Botany Bay marooned here fifteen
years ago by Captain James T Kirk

TERRELL
Listen to me -- you men and women --

KHAN

Save your strength Captain these
people have sworn to live and die at
my command two hundred years before
you were born Do you mean he

(ie Chekov)
never told you the tale
To amuse you Captain Never told
you how the Enterprise picked up the
Botany Bay lost in space from the
year 1996 myself and the ships
company in cryogenic freeze

TERRELL
Ive never even met Admiral Kirk --

KHAN
Admiral He didnt tell you how
Admiral Kirk sent seventy of us into
exile on this barren sand heap with
only the contents of these cargo bays
to sustain us

CHEKOV
You lie On Ceti Alpha V there was
life a fair chance to --

KHAN
This is Ceti Alpha V Ceti Alpha VI
exploded six months after we were
left here The shock shifted the
orbit of this planet and everything
was laid waste Admiral Kirk never
bothered to check on our progress
It was only the fact of my genetically
engineered intellect that enabled us
to survive On earth two hundred
years ago I was a prince with power
over millions -- now like Prometheus
I have been left by Admiral Kirk to
digest my own entrails

CHEKOV
Captain Kirk was your host You repaid
his hospitality by trying to steal his
ship and murder him

KHAN

(moves closer)
And Ill wager he never told you
about his shipmate the beautiful
and courageous Lieutenant McGiver
who gave up everything to join me
in exile OUT OF LOVE And see how
Admiral Kirk requited her devotion --
Shes dead as earth

The wind howls in the silence When Khan turns his
eyes are filled with tears

KHAN
(continuing)
A plague upon you all

He recovers his poise and returns to them --

KHAN
(continuing)
You didnt expect to find me
You thought this was Ceti Alpha VI
Why are you here

They dont answer Khan goes over to Terrell and WITH
ONE HAND LIFTS HIM INTO THE AIR --

KHAN
(continuing)
Why
Terrell gasps stays silent --
KHAN
(continuing)
No matter

He lets go Terrell falls with a thud --

KHAN

(continuing)
You will soon tell me willingly
enough

He goes over to the tank and dips a kind of strainer in
pulling out TWO CETI EELS -- wriggling items --

KHAN

(continuing)
Let me introduce you to Ceti Alpha Vs
only remaining indigenous life form
what do you think Theyve killed
twenty of my people including my
beloved wife Oh not all at once
and not instantly to be sure Their
young enter through the ears and wrap
themselves around the cerebral cortex
This has the effect of rendering the
victim extremely susceptible to
suggestion Later as they grow
follows madness paralysis -- and
death These are pets of course --
not quite domesticated

As he speaks Khan dumps an eel in each of their helmets

he swirls the helmets around as though he were mixing
martinis --

CHEKOV
Khan listen to me Captain Kirk
was only doing his duty You --

CLOSE UP - KHAN - CAMERA IN

KHAN
There is some pain at first I am
told and then the effects are quite
benign -- until the end That was
what I learned from watching my wife

At a sign the helmets are slammed down As the muffled
shrieks are heard from within the eels crawl across
the faces of Chekov and Terrell with unerring in-
stincts they head for the ears of the two hapless men
There is some atrocious pain as they enter -- then
dazed calm

KHAN
(continuing)

Thats better Now tell me why
you are here -- and tell me where I
may find James Kirk

SPOCK
We cant all be perfect Saavik
You must control your prejudices
and remember that as a Vulcan as
well as a Romulan you are forever
a stranger in an alien land
Around you are humans and as a
member of the Starfleet you are
unlikely ever to escape their
presence or their influence

You say you have no details of

CHEKOV
Beyond what I told you sir it is
classified information

KHAN
Umm And would Admiral Kirk have
access to such information

CHEKOV

I would think so sir Hes on the

Then to whom do you report directly
regarding Genesis

To Doctor Marcus the civilian

intended that --

Like all living beings Admiral
each according to his gifts The

KIRK
That wont be necessary just take
me to Regula I

SPOCK
Excuse my presumption but I do not
agree As a teacher on a training
mission I am content to command a

duty it is clear that the senior
officer aboard must assume command

I am a Vulcan I have no ego to bruise

Kirk smiles in bemused wonderment

You are going to remind me that
logic alone dictates your actions

Your mistake if I may be so bold
was promotion Commanding a Starship
is your first best destiny Anything
else is a waste of material

PRESTON

KIRK

The word is given warp speed

PRESTON

Aye

He dies Pause Scotty looks across the body at Kirk

SCOTTY
WHY

KIRK
(looks at Preston)
He wants to kill me for passing
sentence on him 14 years ago -- and
he doesnt care who stands between
him and his vengeance

BONES
Scotty Im sorry

SCOTTY
He stayed at his post When the

Squeezes his shoulder and limps off -- We NOW HEAR

the sound of impulse power taking effect

KIRK
Are you all right

Bones shrugs unhappily looks at Preston

BONES
Doctors lose patients sometimes
Damn Im still in the dark Howd
he know about Genesis

KIRK
At the moment that question takes
a back seat to preventing him from
laying his hands on it You said it

yourself were talking about a bang
that would re-arrange the universe

BONES
There may still be time you gave
as good as you got

No life signs -- but he was there
Captured us He -- he put creatures

in our bodies To control our minds
Bones takes over Chekov --

CHEKOV
Made us say -- lies Do

controlled us but he didnt
The Captain was strong

Chekov breaks into tears Kirk looks at Terrell who
more composed

KIRK
Captain Where is Dr Marcus
Where are the Genesis materials

TERRELL
He couldnt find them Some of
the scientists were still here
but everything else even the data
banks -- were empty

SAAVIK
Thats true Admiral All the
memory cells have been emptied

KIRK
(ponders )
Erased

TERRELL

He tortured those people None of
them would tell him anything He
went wild strung them up and slit
their throats He wanted to tear
the place apart but he was late
he had to get back to Reliant in
time to blow you to bits

KIRK
He came damn close

CHEKOV
He left us
(with irony)
We were no longer of use
SAAVIK
Where is the Reliant crew Dead

TERRELL
Marooned on Ceti Alpha V Hes
completely mad Admiral He blames
you for the death of his wife

Chekov and Terrell look at each other they seem a bit
stronger

CHEKOV
It was not my impression He spent
most of his time trying to wring the
information out of the people

Saavik approaches Kirk

SAAVIK
Anything

Kirk looks at her over the rims of the glasses

KIRK
Somebody left the unit on If
everyone else was dead it implies
that no one remained to turn it off
Those people back there bought escape
time for Genesis with their lives

Saavik studies the console

SAAVIK
It doesnt make sense These
coordinates are well within

lifeless and airless

KIRK

Admiral if we go by the book like
Lieutenant Saavik hours could seem
like days

KIRK

I read you Captain Lets have it

Fractional pause

SPOCKS VOICE
The situation is grave Admiral We
wont have main power for six days
at least Auxiliary power has
temporarily failed but maybe we can
restore that in two days By the
book Admiral

Kirk frowns

KIRK
Meaning you cant even beam us back

SPOCKS VOICE
Not at present

Kirk looks at Saavik and Bones decides --

KIRK
Captain Spock if you do not hear
from us within one hour your orders
are to restore what power you can
take the Enterprise to the nearest
Star Base and alert Starfleet
command when you are out of jamming
range

UHURAS VOICE
Sir -- we wont leave you behind

KIRK
Uhura if you dont hear from us
there wont be anybody behind Kirk
out
(to Terrell and Chekov)
You gentleman can remain here or

TERRELL
If its all the same Admiral wed
like to share the risk
KIRK
(hesitates)
Very well Lets go

BONES
Go Where are we going

KIRK
(points to console)
Where they went Saavik

Kirk walks onto the pods as Saavik works the console
rolling in electronic coding The others join Kirk

BONES
But what if they went -- nowhere

KIRK
Then this will be your big chance
to get away from it all

SAAVIK
Ready

they VANISH

them covered and helpless

David makes a reckless break for Terrell Saavik
instantly throws herself on him bringing him down as
Terrell fires hitting Jedda who was behind David --

As though tearing off a leach Terrell grabs at the
wrist recorder and flings it to the ground A shock-
wave of pain hits Terrell He recovers trembling and
tries to obey Chekov is shaking badly Terrell aims
his phaser at Kirk Chekov slowly raises his phaser
and aims at Terrell though his hands are like lead
We THINK Chekov is going to do the right thing Then
shockingly Terrell turns his phaser on himself

alone

dont have me You were going to

one man dead its two in case
youve lost count

David has been effectively spiked Long silence
KIRK
Do you have anything to eat I
dont know about anyone else but
Im starved

BONES
How can you think of food at a time
like this

KIRK
Our first order of business is survival

CAROL
Theres food in the Genesis cave
enough to last a lifetime -- should
that be necessary

BONES
We thought this was Genesis
Carol laughs -- theres an edge of hysteria to it
CAROL

This It took the Starfleet corps
of engineers ten months in space
suits to tunnel out all this What
we did in there -- we did in a day
David why dont you show Dr McCoy
and the Lieutenant our idea of food

DAVID
But we cant just sit here --

Oh yes we can Is there really
something to eat

David looks at his father who checks his watch putting
on his spectacles

my way out of death and patted myself

how we face death is at least as
important as how we face life --
