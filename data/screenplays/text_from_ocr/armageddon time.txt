ARMAGEDDON TIME

EXT THE CLOUDS 1

White The CAMERA TILTS DOWN to SEE a handful of some of
the tallest older BUILDINGS in NEW YORK CITY

We begin to PAN AWAY FROM THE SKYLINETHROUGH MIST
Across the BRIDGE and the RIVERtoward

QUEENS And all those residential houses and low-level
buildings

SMASH CUT TO

INT PUBLIC SCHOOL CLASSROOM - MORNING 2
SUPERIMPOSE THE LEGEND “QUEENS NEW YORK FALL 1980”

A public school PS 173Q A large SIXTH GRADE classroom
The desks and books and blackboard are worn perhaps as much
as 30 years old cursive handwriting templates line the top
of the room and are yellowing with antiquity

The classroom is INSANELY PACKED AND FILLED WITH THE ENERGY
OF FORTY-FIVE CHILDREN

It is a real mix of ethnicities white Black Asian Latino
Tall short Fat skinny In short everyone looks
different from everyone else

The TEACHER a diminutive man named MR TURKELTAUB is at the
blackboard He CLAPS HIS HANDS REPEATEDLY for ATTENTION

MR TURKELTAUB
Arright come on settle down

The CLASS QUIETS A beat He begins

MR TURKELTAUB (CONT’D)
Welcome to first day of school My
name is Mr Turkeltaub and I hope
you all had a good summer Mine on
the other hand was a little too
short but what else is new

As Turkeltaub speaks the CAMERA MOVES IN not TO A CLOSE
SHOT ON THE TEACHER but rather to a CLOSE SHOT on
GOLDENROD REVISIONS 2

A DRAWING on a desk over the shoulder of a student
Primitive but not bad a rendering of MR TURKELTAUB drawn
in pencil on white lined paper in one of those black-with-
white speckled “composition” books so popular with grade
school

REVEAL the “artist” a boy of twelve PAUL GRAFF red-haired
and pale and freckled and bespectacled He PLANTS his TONGUE
in his cheek wall as he works Over this image

MR TURKELTAUB (0C) (CONT’D)
You are in the sixth grade now
which means every one of you has
added responsibility Because you
are the leaders of this school

CUT BACK to ANGLE ON TURKELTAUB as he looks at his book

MR TURKELTAUB (CONT’D)
Okay thenlet’s go Jennifer
Ashkenazi

A KID’S VOICE
Here

ANGLE BACK ON PAUL who looks around to see if anyone is
looking No one is So with a smirk he holds his drawing
up to his classmates

Many of the boys eye his masterpiece with curiosity as Mr
Turkeltaub continues to look at his attendee list (The GIRLS
ARE MUCH MORE DILIGENT AND ORDERLY far better behaved) A
NOTE is passed to PAUL “DRAW A TURKEY BODY”

MR TURKELTAUB
Keith Breslow

ANOTHER KID’S VOICE
Here

PAUL DRAWS a TURKEY BODY on Turkeltaub’s portrait then SHOWS
the DRAWING AGAIN LAUGHTER TURKELTAUB LOOKS UP

A BEAT OF SILENCE Nothing Back to the book

MR TURKELTAUB
Jonathan Davis

In the BACK OF THE CLASSROOM JOHNNY DAVIS tall Black a
year older than the other kids He grins and stands

JOHNNY DAVIS
(bad English accent)
The name’s Bond--JAMES Bond
GOLDENROD REVISIONS 3

The CLASS LAUGHS and Paul turns to Johnny smiles in
approval Another kid snatches the drawing passes it AROUND

MR TURKELTAUB
Mr Davis You and I are old
friends at this point and you KNOW
I will NOT tolerate any nonsense
(death stare then)
Joanne Dersch

KID’S VOICE
Here

Turkeltaub LOOKS UP sees Paul’s drawing being passed about

MR TURKELTAUB
Arright give me that Come on--
You

Paul panics A fellow student sheepishly hands the drawing
to the teacher Turkeltaub looks at it

MR TURKELTAUB (CONT’D)

Silence Paul quakes

MR TURKELTAUB (CONT’D)

Tears well up in Paul’s eyes Turkeltaub looks tenderly at
him for a moment then thinks better of it
GOLDENROD REVISIONS 4

MR TURKELTAUB

PAUL GRAFF

PAUL WALKS TO THE FRONT OF THE ROOM A KID’S VOICE calls out
a mistake on the teacher’s name

Davis points to his own chest Sotto

JOHNNY DAVIS
Me

MR TURKELTAUB
Yes you Id think after last
year you might’ve grown up a
little but I guess that’d be too
much to ask

Turkeltaub grabs a desk spins it violently to the front of
the room right near the blackboard Davis takes his things
and makes his way to the FRONT OF THE CLASSROOM

MR TURKELTAUB (CONTD)
No wonder it’s your second time
through sixth grade with me
‘Cause you got nothing up here
Mister--NOTHING

Turkeltaub points to his HEAD

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 5

Davis has heard this and the insult lands He is
humiliated and sits in a solo desk right in front of the
blackboard Paul FACES the blackboard standing right next
to the seated JOHNNY DAVIS

Then A SOUND of CHIMES it comes from a very old loudspeaker
above the blackboard A VOICE

WOMAN’S VOICE (LOUDSPEAKER FUZZ)
Attention please teachers and
students Would you please stand
for the Pledge of Allegiance of the
United States

Everyone stands

THE CLASS (0C)
I pledge allegiance to the flag
of the United States of America
And to the Republic for which it
stands one nation under God
invisible the class gets it
wrong with liberty and justice

Someone makes a “RASPBERRY” NOISE

MR TURKELTAUB

letters made up of exactly that
thing So--here--look--the word is

PAUL IS SILENT Esther is STRANGELY QUIET CALM

ESTHER GRAFF
Would you please answer him
GOLDENROD REVISIONS 50

PAUL GRAFF
No Obviously not

ESTHER GRAFF
(to Sebell)
Principal Sebell I can tell you
he had no idea what he was doing
There isn’t anything like that in
our home And he wasn’t the one
who brought it to school

PRINCIPAL SEBELL
We know that

ESTHER GRAFF
(tries to go on the
offensive positive)
And--and I think it is incumbent
upon the school not only to really
take a good long look at class
size but who’s in what class

PRINCIPAL SEBELL
Mrs Graff I know you were
thinking of running for the
district board--but--have you ever
thought about a remedial education
for Paul

ESTHER GRAFF
Remedial

PRINCIPAL SEBELL
Yes remedial classes for your
son

ESTHER GRAFF
(given pause darkens)
No I have not

PRINCIPAL SEBELL
It might be an option for you and
your family going forward
(beat re Paul)
Because he may be a bit slow

Esther’s disposition changes completely She seems almost
proud of Paul now It was precisely the wrong thing for him
to have said and she defends her son

MARYANNE TRUMP (CONT’D)
But you’re not going to That’s
right Unless Unless you follow
the example I’m gonna set forth for
you Now you may be saying to
yourself what does she know
Well when I came here no one
handed me anything for free How
did I succeed By good old-
fashioned hard work And that’s
how you’re gonna make it If it
was a question of an assignment for
English class I did what was
asked of me--and more I knew
there was no free lunch Through
college law school the US
Attorney’s office I was a woman in
a man’s business But I kept on
fighting That’s right girls--I’m
talking to you too You can be
anything you want to be in this
the greatest country in the world
All it takes is dedication I look
at others in my family--my brother
Donald He went here not always
studying so hard mind you But I
see him now at his desk at 730
every morning ready to take on the
world just as my father did Now
you people here in this institution
are gonna wind up on top And
youll know at the end of the day
it won’t be because a handout but
because you have earned your way
there That’s why I’m proud to
present the award which has always
been my favorite last year’s
student who best represents the
Forest Manor School ideal You
know that doesn’t mean the best
grades or the most popular
student It means the student who
possesses the most balanced
qualities of citizen and
ambassador So the Frederick C
Trump award to the student who best
represents the Forest Manor ideal
goes toPAUL GRAFF

together be grateful for all we’ve
been given and all the positive
things in life Now this year I
must say something just feels a
little extra special Because we
