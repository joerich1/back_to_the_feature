FADE IN
INT CONCOURSEAIRPORT TERMINAL - BAY

CLOSE ON A FACE A nine year old boy YOUNG COLE his eyes wide
with wonder watching something intently We HEAR the sounds of
the PA SYSTEM droning Flight Information mingled with the
sounds of urgent SHOUTS running FEET EXCLAMATIONS

YOUNG COLES POV twenty yards away a BLONDE MAN is sprawled on
the floor blood oozing from his gaudy Hawaiian shirt

A BRUNETTE in a tight dress her face obscured from YOUNG COLES
view rushes to the injured man kneels beside him ministering
to his wound

ANGLE ON YOUNG COLE flanked by his PARENTS their faces out of
view as they steer him away

FATHERS VOICE (0s)
Come on Son --this is no place for us

YOUNG COLE resists momentarily mesmerized by the drama

YOUNG COLES POV intermittently visible through a confusion of
FIGURES rushing through the foreground the BLONDE MAN reaching
up and touching the cheek of the kneeling BRUNETTE in a gesture
of enormous tenderness a gesture of farewell while the PA
SYSTEM continues its monotonous monotone
PA SYSTEM
Flight 784 for San Francisco is now
ready for boarding at inmate number

INT PRISON DORMITORYFUTURE - ETERNAL NIGHT

PRISON PA SYSTEM
--number 5429 Garcia -- number 87645 Cole

COLE late thirties dark hair comes awake in a bunk cage one
of many stacked four high along both sides of a long dim
corridor He blinks in the near dark shaken disoriented

Then as he recovers from his very vivid dream WE GET OUR
FIRST LOOK AT HIS ENVIRONMENT A WINDOWLESS UNDERGROUND WORLD OF
ETERNAL NIGHT SOMETIME IN THE FUTUREAN ALMOST COLORLESS
REALITY OF BLURRED EDGES AND ECHOEY SOUNDS MUCH MORE
DREAMLIKE THAN HIS DREAM

Flashlights glare In the half-light COLE sees spooky figures
GUARDS moving among the locked bunkcages

COLE turns and whispers to the occupant of the next cage JOSE

COLE
Ssssst Jose whats going on

JOSEs face is almost lost in shadow What there is of it is
youthful Hes just a scared Puerto Rican kid

JOSE
Volunteers again

JOSE immediately rolls over and feigns sleep as SCARFACE a
menacing guard with a jagged scar running down his cheek looms

close to COLEs cage and unlocks it

SCARFACE
Volunteer duty

The PRISONERS in the other cages watch silently with narrowed eyes

COLE
I didnt volunteer

SCARFACE
You causing trouble again

COLE
(controls his temper)
No trouble
INT EQUIPMENT ROOM - ETERNAL NIGHT

COLEs alone struggling to get into what looks like a space suit
in a room where suits hang like ghosts with blank eyes
TITLES BEGIN SUPERED OVER THE SCENE
COLE has the torso of the suit on now and is trying to close it

OFFSCREEN VOICE (os)
All openings must be closed

COLE looks for the source of the voice a tiny grate in the wall
OFFSCREEN VOICE (os)

If the integrity of the suit is compromised

in any way if the fabric is torn or a zipper

not closed readmittance will be denied
INT SEALED CHAMBER - MINUTES LATER (ETERNAL NIGHT)
COLE wearing the space suit and a helmet with a plastic visor
steps into a tiny chamber a kind of air lock The heavy door
clangs shut behind him Hes alone COLES breath comes quicker

now as he sucks oxygen from the air tanks on his back

On the opposite wall is another door with a huge wheel lock
COLE turns the heavy wheel opens the door steps through It

INT ELEVATOR - SECONDS LATER (ETERNAL NIGHT)

COLES in an ascending elevator that groans and creaks He looks
down at a crudely drawn map he holds in his gloved hand

The map shows a series of tunnels and ladders

INT SEWER PIPE - MINUTES LATER (NIGHT)

COLE pans a flashlight probing the filthy sewer hes wading through
RATS flee the blade of light scurry across islands of rusting junk
The flashlight beam settles on a ladder mounted in the wall
Reaching the rusted ladder COLE starts to climb awkwardly

EXT CITY STREETFUTURE - MOMENTS LATER (NIGHT)

A SCRAPING NOISE as a heavy man-hole cover is pushed up and moved
aside COLES helmeted head emerges from below

COLES POV THROUGH HIS PLASTIC-VISORED HELMET a city in
moonlight A surreal image of abandoned buildings No people
anywhere The only sounds are the WIND and COLES BREATHING
EXT ANOTHER CITY STREET - MINUTES LATER (NIGHT)

COLES light reveals abandoned vine-covered automobiles

Moving to the nearest car COLE searches in the vines for
something Finds it An insect
COLE takes the bug in his gloved hand As he clumsily inserts it
into a collection tube something makes him turn

Theres something across the street in the dark Something alive

COLE points his flashlight and revealsa BEAR Startled by the
light the animal blinks then stands on its rear legs and ROARS

ANGLE ON COLE staring wide-eyed

Then the BEAR sinks down onto all fours and trying to avoid the
flashlight it pads quickly down the street

INT SUBTERRANEAN PARKING GARAGE - NIGHT

Using the flashlight to see COLE reaches down to the cracked
floor and gets another specimen DOGSHIT

The only sound is COLES labored BREATHING

Then a different SOUND GRRRR A dog More GRRRRS More
dogs Then a YIP Then VICIOUS GROWLS Its a DOGFIGHT

EXT STREET - NIGHT (FIRST LIGHT)

A giant OWL perched on an overhead traffic light raises its wings
and lifts offrising higher and higher into the brightening sky

Below on the street COLE trudges along passing deserted
buildings windows broken rusted signs dangling

INT DEPARTMENT STORE - NIGHT (FIRST LIGHT)

COLES light reveals a spider web just inside the store A large
SPIDER tries to hide from the light

COLE reaches carefully into the web and plucks the spider and
puts it into one of his specimen tubes

Then he shines his light all around the once elegant store Theres
nothing but aisle after aisle of moldering consumer goods

EXT DEPARTMENT STORE - DAWN

As COLE comes out of the store the first rays of the sun hit the
building COLE stops squints into the light through his visor

COLES POV spray-painted on the wall a long time ago is a stenciled
logo of twelve monkeys holding hands in a circle Over it is
written WE DID IT

COLE looks up

COLES POV high up on a building across the street a LION
patrols a ledge pauses looks out majestically over his world
TTTLES END
INT FIRST UNDERGROUND DECONTAMINATION CHAMBER - ETERNAL NIGHT

ROARING WATER powerful torrents gushing from nozzles in the
wall pummel the still-suited COLE

INT SECOND UNDERGROUND DECONTAMINATION CHAMBER - ETERNAL NIGHT

Stark naked and shivering COLE is being scrubbed with brushes on
long poles (like the ones used to wash cars) wielded by two HULKING
FIGURES in bulky decontamination suits their personas lost in their
windowed masks Its a grim scene in a grim cement room with damp
dripping walls From an unseen source comes an AMPLIFIED VOICE

AMPLIFIED VOICE (os)
Raise your arms above your head

COLE lifts his arms and the FIGURES start scrubbing his armpits
INT TINY CHAMBER - SHORTLY (ETERNAL NIGHT)

Still naked COLE is seated on a stool while a MASKED TECHNICIAN
in a less elaborate less bulky decontamination outfit draws
blood from COLES arm with an old-fashioned hypodermic needle
COLE glances toward a single nearly opaque window of thick
plastic in the rusty iron wall VAGUE FIGURES seem to lurk
behind the translucent aperture studying him

The TECHNICIAN slips the blood sample through a slot in the wall
INT ENGINEERING OFFICEFUTURE WORLD - ETERNAL NIGHT

Ushered in by two guards TINY and SCARFACE COLE looks around
COLES POV wails hidden by old headlines articles maps charts

a blackboard covered with elaborate sophisticated formulaesurfaces
heaped with cracked monitors gerry-rigged computers held together

with
string lasers lost in tangles of cable ancient tube amplifiers a
dilapidated cardboard reconstruction of a city stacks of moldering
books and tattered computer printoutsand seated at a long
conference

table staring at COLE six SCIENTISTS an ASTROPHYSICIST ENGINEER
BOTANIST MICROBIOLOGIST ZOOLOGIST and a GEOLOGIST They represent
a modern science where brilliant new ideas interface with crude
outdated patched-together technologies

TINY
James Cole Cleared from quarantine

MICROBIOLOGIST
Thank you You two wait outside

SCARFACE
Hes got a history Doctor Violence
COLES eyes return to the walls

Headlines CLOCK TICKING NO CURE YET
SCARFACE
Anti-social six -- doing 25 to life
ENGINEER

I dont think hes going to hurt us Youre
not going to hurt us are you Mr Cole

COLES head turns quickly to the ENGINEER

COLE
No sir

The GUARDS exchange a look shrug exit closing the door

MICROBIOLOGIST
Why dont you sit down Mr Cole

COLE goes to the empty chair at the conference table sits down

ASTROPHYSICIST
We want you to tell us about last
night

COLE

I went to the surface and I collected
specimens like I was told

The SCIENTISTS dont say anything They just study him carefully

COLE
(worried)
I mashed the spider didnt I

MICROBIOLOGIST
Well get to the spider later Mr
Cole Right now we want to know
everything that you saw

INT ENGINEERING OFFICE - AN HOUR LATER (ETERNAL NIGHT)

COLE starting to look very tired now stands at the blackboard
sketching a detailed map of exactly where he was last night

ASTPOPHYSICIST
Where you collected sample 4 what
street was that

COLE
Uh

BOTANIST
Its important to observe everything
COLE
I think it wasIm sure it was 2nd Street

As the SCIENTISTS start to whisper animatedly among themselves
COLES eyes drift across the newspaper clippings taped to the
wall One headline screams VIRUS MUTATING Another features
a photo of an OLD MAN (DR MASON who well see again later on)
and the words SCIENTIST SAYS ITS TOO LATE FOR CURE

ASTROPHYSICISTS VOICE (os)
Close your eyes Cole

Startled COLE closes his eyes obediently
BLACKNESS Like COLE WE SEE NOTHING But we HEAR their VOICES

ENGINEERS VOICE (os)
Tell us in detail what youve seen in
this room

COLES VOICE (os)
Uh in this room Uh

MICROBIOLOGISTS VOICE (os)
How many of us are there

COLES VOICE (os)
Sixseven if you count me

ASTROPHYSICISTS VOICE (os)
Tell us about the pictures on the wall

COLES VOICE (os)
Uh you mean the newspapers

A MONTAGE OF OVERLAPPING VOICES (os)
Tell us about the newspapers Can you
hear my voice What do I look like
What does he look like the man who
just spoke How old were you when you
left the surface

The VOICES blur into a cacophony and FADE INTO the droning PA
SYSTEM at the airport

INT CONCOURSEAIRPORT - DAY

THE DREAM AGAIN But at an earlier moment YOUNG COLE flanked
by his PARENTS whose faces are out of view is watching a PLANE
land through one of the big glass windows that lines the concourse

leading to the departure gates

PA SYSTEM (os)
Flight 784 now boarding at gate

Suddenly a SHOUT followed by raised VOICES interrupts the
monotonous airport routine As YOUNG COLE and his PARENTS turn
to see whats going on a man well call MR PONYTAIL his face
averted hurries past them bumping YOUNG COLE with a Chicago
Hulls Sports Duffle Bag

MR PONYTAIL
WATCH IT

YOUNG COLE sees little more than the gaudy pants the duffle and
the mans ponytail flopping as he rushes towards the gates

Just then a WOMANS VOICE cries out NOOOOOOOOO

YOUNG COLE turns back toward the Security Check Point just as
TRAVELERS scatter madly some diving to the floor others
running A TERRIFIED TRAVELER hitting the floor close by looks
up at YOUNG COLE with panicky eyes and asks

TERRIFIED TRAVELER
Just exactly why did you volunteer

INT ENGINEERING OFFICEFUTURE WORLD - (ETERNAL NIGHT)
COLE comes abruptly awake Seated now hes facing the SCIENTISTS

ASTROPHYSICIST
Wake up Cole

COLE
Uh I didnt hear the

MICROBIOLOGIST
(tapping a pencil on the table)
I asked you why did you volunteer

COLE
Well the guard woke me up He told me
I volunteered

The SCIENTISTS react whispering urgently among themselves

COLE starts to nod off again then comes awake with a start as
the ENGINEER speaks to him

ENGINEER
We appreciate you volunteering Youre

a very good observer Cole

COLE
Uh thank you

ENGINEER
Youll get a reduction in sentence

COLE keeps his face impassive

ASTROPHYSICIST
To be determined by the proper authorities

ENGINEER
You dont want to jeopardize that reduction
do you Cole Have it taken away

COLE
No sir

ASTROPHYSICIST
We have a very advanced program something
very different requires very skilled people

MICROBIOLOGIST
An opportunity to reduce your sentence
considerably

ZOOLOGIST

And possibly play an important role in
returning the human race to the surface
of the earth

ENGINEER
We want tough minded people Strong
mentally Weve had somemisfortunes
with unstable types

ASTROPHYSICIST
For a man in your positionan opportunity

BOTANIST
Not to volunteer could be a real mistake

MICROBIOLOGIST
(tapping his pencil again)
Definitely a mistake

COLE gives away nothing Hes in a box here He has no choices
He stares at the tapping pencil

INT ART GALLERY - NIGHT

A strikingly real world of bright colors Extravagant paintings
adorn the walls A POET tiny and ruddy faced squints over his
glasses as he reads in a booming voice to an AUDIENCE of thirty
seated on folding chairs

POET
Still among the myriad microwaves the
infra-red messages the gigabytes of ones
and zeroes we find words infinitesimally
small byte-sized now tinier even than
science lurking in some vague electricity
where if we listen we can hear the solitary
voice of that poet telling us
We are no other than a moving row
Of Magic shadow-shapes that come and go
Round with the Sun-illumined Lantern hold
In Midnight by the Master of the show

As the POET reads we STUDY the audience mostly YUPPIE CULTURE
JUNKIES or BOHEMIANS Among them a light-haired woman of twenty-
eight soberly dressed wearing glasses Shes KATHRYN RAILLY And
its her beeper that suddenly BEEPS BEEP BEEP

POETS VOICE (os)
The Moving Finger writes and having writ
Moves on nor all your Piety nor Wit
Shall lure it back to cancel half a Line
Nor all your Tears wash out a Word of it

BEEP BEEP Scowling at the outrageous interruption the POET
looks up from the text just as RAILLY tumbling shuts off the
beeper and rises embarrassed As she makes her way to an exit
the glaring POET continues

POET
Yesterday This Days Madness did prepare
Tomorrows Silence Triumph or Despair
Drink for you know not whence you came nor why
Drink for you know not why you go nor where

INT CORRIDORPOLICE STATION - NIGHT
DETECTIVE FRANKI leads RAILLY past crowded holding cells

FRANKI
-- so they get there and they ask the guy
real nice for some kind of id and he gets
agitated starts screaming about viruses
Totally irrational totally disoriented
doesnt know where he is what day it is
alla that stuff All they got was his
name They figure hes stoned out of
his mind its some kinda psychotic
episode so theyre gonna bring him

RAILLY
Hes been tested for drugs

FRANKI
Negative for drugs But he took on
five cops like he was dusted to the
eyeballs No drugs You believe that

FRANKI pauses indicating a tiny observation window of thick meshed
glass in an otherwise solid door and RAILLY looks through it

RAILLYS POV THROUGH THE WINDOW a MAN his back to her in
strait-jacket and prison denims examining the wall of the padded
cell with the distorted intensity of a mental case

RAILLY
You have him in restraints
FRANKI
Were you listening We got two officers in
the hospital Yeah hes in restraints plus
the medic gave him enough stellazine to kill
a horse Look at him Still on his feet

RAILLYS POV THROUGH THE WINDOW the MAN in the cell turns looks
right at her In spite of the cuts and welts its clearly COLE

RAILLY
That would explain the bruises I
guess The struggle

FRANKI
You want to go in Examine him

RAILLY
Yes please You said he gave a name

FRANKI
(unlocking the door)
James Cole Thats everything we got None
of the James Coles on the computer match him
No license no prints no warrants Nothing
You want me to go in with you

RAILLY
(entering)
No thank you
FRANKI

Ill be right herejust in case
INT ISOLATION CELL

COLE stares at RAILLY The environment is intensely realvivid
colorseach sound however slight very distinct almost loud
and yet she appears to him almost like a vision

COLE
(slightly confused)

RAILLY
1995 is the future James This is 1989

COLE looks stunned
INT POLICE STATION CORRIDOR - MORNING

COLE bound tightly by the strait-jacket heavy manacles on his
ankles is being escorted down the corridor by two surly POLICEMEN

COLE
Where are you taking me

POLICEMAN 1
South of France buddy Fancy hotel
Youre gonna love it

COLE
South of France I dont want to go
to the South of France I want to make
a telephone call

POLICEMAN 2 smirks as he unlocks a heavy steel door

POLICEMAN 2
Zip it scumbag -- you fooled the shrink
with your act but you dont fool us

Then POLICEMAN 2 swings the steel door open and sunlight
overwhelms COLE blinding him in a dazzling fury of white light

EXT CITY STREETMINI-VAN - DAY

A Mini-van the kind of vehicle used to transport a half dozen
prisoners crawls through a busy street The Police Department
logo is prominent on the side of the van beneath barred windows

INT COUNTY HOSPITALSHOWERS - AN HOUR LATER (MORNING)

Fierce spray recalls the decontamination in the future COLE
stands stark naked under the shower while two muscular attendants
PALMER and BILLINGS supervise

As PALMER shuts off the water BILLINGS hands COLE a towel and
starts inspecting his scalp

BILLINGS
Lemme see your head Jimbo see if you
got any creepy crawlies
COLE
I need to make a telephone call

BILLINGS
(pulling Coles head)
Gotta work that out with a doctor Jimbo
Cant make no calls til the doctor says

COLE
Its very important

BILLINGS
What chew gotta do Jimbo is take it
easy relax into things We all gonna
get along fine if you just relax

COLE gets the hint of menace in the message and submits to the
lice inspection only his eyes revealing his frustration

INT HOSPITALDAYROOM - HALF AN HOUR LATER (DAY)

COLE stands in the doorway stunned by his first sight of the
large room His eyes go to the heavily-grilled windows where
light pours in from outside Then to the TV where a CARTOON

COMMERCIAL makes raucous noises

PATIENTS in K-Mart street clothes or ratty robes

stare gloomily

at the TV or play cards pace or just stare blankly

BILLINGS is at COLES side beckoning to a patient JEFFREY MASON
a twenty year old white youth dressed in khakis and a plaid shirt

BILLINGS

Jeffrey Yo Jeffrey This here is James

Whyncha show James around Tell him the TV
rules show him the games an stuff okay

JEFFREY
(with a sly look)
How much you gonna pay me Huh Id
be doing your job

BILLINGS
Five thousand dollars my man That
enough Ill wire it to your account
as usual okay

JEFFREY
Okay Billings Five thousand Thats
enough Five thousand dollars Ill
give him the Deluxe Mental Hospital Tour

As BILLINGS walks away chuckling JEFFREY turns to COLE

JEFFREY

Kid around kid around It makes them feel
good were all pals Were prisoners theyre
the guards but its all in good fun you see

COLE nods and JEFFREY indicates card tables where PATIENTS are
playing cards checkers chess or working on jig saw puzzles

JEFFREY
Heres the games Games vegitize you
If you play the games youre
voluntarily taking a tranquilizer

COLE sees a partially completed puzzle of the well-known painting
THE PEACEABLE KINGDOM depicting a serene world of animals in harmony

JEFFREY
Whatd they give you Thorazine How
much Learn your drugs -- know your doses
COLE

I need to make a telephone call

JEFFREY
A telephone call Thats communication
with the outside world Doctors
discretion Hey if alla these nuts
could just make phone calls it could
spread Insanity oozing through telephone
cables oozing into the ears of all those
poor sane people infecting them Whackos
everywhere A plague of madness
(suddenly sly and confidential
In fact very few of us here are actually
mentally ill Im not saying youre
not mentally ill for all I know youre
crazy as a loon But thats not why
youre here Why youre here is because
of the system because of the economy
(indicating the TV)
Theres the TV Its all right there
Commercials We are not productive
anymore they dont need us to make
things anymore its all automated What
are we for then Were consumers Okay
buy a lot of stuff youre a good citizen
But if you dont buy a lot of stuff you
know what Youre mentally ill Thats
a fact If you dont buy thingstoilet
paper new cars computerized blenders
electrically operated sexual devices
(getting hysterical)
SCREWDRIVERS WITH MINIATURE BUILT-IN
RADAR DEVICES STEREO SYSTEMS WITH
BRAIN IMPLANTED HEADPHONES VOICE-
ACTIVATED COMPUTERS AND

A woman orderly TERRY turns from the feeble PATIENT shes helping
TERRY
Take it easy Jeffrey Be calm

Abruptly JEFFREY stifles his hysteria takes a deep breath and
continues completely calm now But COLE isnt listening Hes
mesmerized by the TV

JEFFREY
So if you want to watch a particular
program say All My Children or
something you go to the Charge Nurse
and tell her what day and time the show
you want to see is on But you have to
tell her before the show is scheduled
to be on There was this one guy who
was always requesting shows that had already
played He couldnt quite grasp the
idea that the Charge Nurse couldnt
just make it be yesterday for him turn
back time ha ha What a fruitcake

This last thought actually penetrates COLES focus on the TV and
he turns to JEFFREY whos picking up speed again

JEFFREY

Seriously more and more people are
being defined now as mentally ill Why
Because theyre not consuming on their
own But as patients they becone
consumers of mental health care And
this gives the so-called sane people work

(hysteria again)
WHOOO SHOCK THERAPY GROUP THERAPY
HALLUCINATIONS THERAPEUTIC DRUGS
IGGIDY DIGGIDY DIG PERFECT THE
SYSTEM IN HARMONY LIKE A BIG MACHINE

TERRY
Okay thats it Jeffrey youre gonna
get a shot I warned you

JEFFREY
(calming himself smiling)
Right Right Carried away heh heh
I got carried away Explaining the
workings ofthe institution

Just then TJ WASHINGTON a somber-looking African American in a
bathrobe taps COLE on the shoulder

TJ WASHINGTON
I dont really come from outer space

JEFFREY
This is TJ Washington Jim -- he
doesnt really come from outer space
TJ WASHINGTON
Dont mock me my friend
(to Cole)

Its a condition of mental divergence

I find myself on another planet Ogo

part of an intellectual elite preparing

to subjugate barbarian hordes on Pluto

But even though its a totally convincing
reality in every wayI can feel breathe

hearnevertheless Ogo is actually a
construct of my psyche I am mentally
divergent in that I am escaping certain
unnamed realities that plague my life

here When I stop going there I will

be well Are you also divergent friend

The PA SYSTEM interrupts startling COLE

PA SYSTEM (vo)

James Cole Report to Staff James Cole

JEFFREY
Staff Whoo Time for Staff Now the
geniuses cure you Hallelujah

INT PSYCH WARD CONFERENCE ROOM - MINUTES LATER (DAY)

COLE is agitated speaking forcefully

RAILLY
friend

around a beat-up conference table

COLE
This is a place for crazy people Im
not crazy

four other PSYCHIATRIC RESIDENTS including RAILLYS best
MARILOU MARTIN and their chief DR OWEN FLETCHER sit

the doctors with BILLINGS looming behind him
bear a strong resemblance to the SCIENTISTS OF THE FUTURE)

RESIDENT 1

watching COLE who sits facing

(Some of the DOCTORS

We dont use that termcrazy Mr Cole

COLE

Well youve got some real nuts in here

Listen to me all of you -- I have to
tell you something thats going to be
difficult for you to understand but

DR RAILLY
Jamesplease These are all doctors
here and we want to help you

DR FLETCHER
Mr Cole -- last night you told Dr
Railly you thought it was
(checking a file)
1995 How about right now Do you
know what year it is right now

COLE

1989 Look Im not confused Theres been
a mistake Ive been sent to the wrong place

Suddenly COLE reaches out and BILLINGS lunges forward but COLE

is just grabbing a pad and pencil

COLE
Hey Im not going to hurt anybody

FLETCHER restrains BILLINGS with a hand signal

COLE
(drawing)
Do any of you know anything about the
Army of the Twelve Monkeys They paint
this stencil it on buildings all
over the place

COLE waves a sketch of the dancing monkey logo we saw earlier

DR CASEY
Mr Cole

COLE
Right I guess you wouldnt this is
1989 theyre probably not active yet
That makes sense Okay Listen to me
three billion people died in 1995
Three billion got that Almost
the whole population Of the world
Only about one percent survived

DOCTORS exchange knowing looks This is an old story apparently

RESIDENT 2
Are you going to save us Mr Cole

COLE
Save you How can I save you It

already happened I cant save you Im
simply trying to get some information for

people in the present so that someday
(sees their eyes)
You dont believe me You think Im

crazy But Im not crazy Im a convict

sure I have a quick temper but Im as
sane aS anyone in this room I

COLE stops sees DR FLETCHER tapping his pencil

COLES seen

that tapping before -- in the future It disorients him

DR RAILLY
Can you tell us the name of the prison
youve come from
COLE doesnt answer Hes staring at the tapping pencil

DR FLETCHER
Does this bother you Mr Cole

COLE
(recovering new tack
No Look I dont belong here What I
need to do is make a telephone call to
straighten everything out

DR FLETCHER
Who would you call Mr Cole who would
straighten everything out

COLE
Scientists Im supposed to report in
to them Theyll want to know they
sent me to the wrong time

DR FLETCHER
So you could talk to these scientists
and they do what Send you to the future

COLE
No no I cant talk to them Its called
yoice mail Im supposed to leave messages

They monitor it from the present

RESIDENT 2
From the present Were not in the
present now Mr Cole

COLE
No no This is the past This has
already happened Listen

RESIDENT 3
Mr Cole you belong in 1995 -- thats
the present is that it

COLE
No 1995 is the past too Look

DR FLETCHER
These scientists Mr Cole Are they
doctors like ourselves

Two of the residents exchange quick knowing looks
COLE
No I mean yes but Look Ive been given
a lot of drugs but Im still perfectly lucid

You have to let me use the phone One call

COLE looks desperately toward RAILLY pleading eyes meeting hers
INT LOW RENT APARTMENT - DAY

Four little KIDS SCREAM and SQUABBLE while the phone CHIRPS
insistently in the tiny cluttered apartment and a harried MOTHER
lunges for the phone answers sharply

MOTHER
Yes
(listens frowns then)
Whaaaaat Voice mail I dont know
what youre talkin about Is this

a joke I dont know any scientists
James who Never heard of you

The MOTHER slams down the phone
INT RAILLYS OFFICECOUNTY HOSPITAL - DAY

A dismayed COLE still has the receiver in his hand Sympathetically
RAILLY takes it from him

RAILLY
It wasnt who you expected

COLE is clearly agitated starts to pace upset Nuts

COLE
It was some lady She didnt know anything

RAILLY
Perhaps it was a wrong number

COLE
No Thats the reason they chose me --
I remember things

RAILLY frowns studying the distracted man with intense interest
Its clear COLE is becoming a special patient and RAILLYS cool
detached demeanor is giving way ever so slightly

RAILLY
James where did you grow up Was it
around here Around Baltimore

COLE
(lost in thought)
What

RAILLY
I have thestrangest feeling Ive met
you beforea long time ago perhaps
Were you ever

COLE
Wait This is only 1989 Im supposed
to be leaving messages in 1995 Its
not the right number yet Thats the
problem Damn How can I contact them

RAILLY recovers her distance her poise as she takes a bottle
pours out some tablets and holds them out to COLE

RAILLY
James take these
(watching him step back)
Please -- I helped you like I said I
would Now I want you to trust me

INT AIRPORT CONCOURSE - DAY (THE DREAM)
MR PONYTAIL races past the startled YOUNG COLE

MR PONYTAIL
WATCH IT

Was it JEFFREY wearing gaudy pants and a ponytail It was
definitely JEFFREYS VOICE

TRAVELERS dive for cover as a WOMANS VOICE cries out

WOMANS VOICE
NOOOOC000N000

The TERRIFIED TRAVELER looks up at YOUNG COLE makes eye contact but
doesnt speak The TERRIFIED TRAVELER looks a lot like DR FLETCHER

Just then YOUNG COLE is distracted by a running figure Its
the BLONDE MAN in the Hawaiian shirt but hes not injured Hes
sprinting toward the gates glancing back over his shoulder his
moustache slightly askew

A sharp CRACK of a GUNSHOT rings out Then DAZZLING LIGHT
Everything goes white

INT DORMITORY (PSYCH WARD) COUNTY HOSPITAL - NIGHT

COLES eyes blink awake blinded by a flashlight

Hes lying in one of thirty beds in a darkened ward Disoriented
Which world is this The room is full of BREATHING SNORING
occasional MOANS He can barely discern the shadowy figures of
an ORDERLY and a NURSE making their rounds checking each bed
His eyes adjusting to the darkness COLE watches them exit

He turns and sees a patch of moonlight coming in a barred window

With a quick glance at the sleeping PATIENTS he slips out of
bed makes his way stealthily to the window peers out

COLES POV the moon glowing in the sky illuminating a single
tree Under the tree in silhouette a COUPLE embraces kisses
ANGLE ON COLE looking out the window absorbed

VOICE (os)
It wont work You cant open it

Alarmed COLE turns sees JEFFREY in the next bed

JEFFREY
You think you can remove the grill but
you cant Its welded

COLE checks the grill anyway

JEFFREY
See I toldja And all the doors are
locked too Theyre protecting the
people on the outside from us But the
people outside are as crazy as us

COLE has become preoccupied with a small SPIDER creeping along
the window sill Hes staring at it when hes distracted by a
sudden SOUND Grabbing the SPIDER COLE scrambles back into bed
just as the door opens and an ORDERLY probes the dark room with
the blade of his flashlight

ANGLE ON COLE in bed feigning sleep
The flashlight clicks off and COLE hears the door close
For a long moment the ward is silent except for BREATHING

SNORES occasional MOANS Then COLE hears JEFFREYS hoarse
whisper picking up right where he left off

JEFFREY
You know what crazy is crazy is
majority rules Take germs for example

Although COLE is preoccupied with the SPIDER struggling to get
out of his fist he cant help reacting to the word germs

COLE
Germs

In the 18th century there was no such
ing Nobodyd ever imagined such a
ing -- no sane person anyway Along

As JEFFREY warms to his subject getting excited COLE tries to
figure out where to put the SPIDER

JEFFREY (cont)

So cut to the 20th century Last week

in fact

right before I got dragged

into this hellhole I order a burger
in this fast food joint The waiter
drops it on the floor He picks it up
wipes it off hands it to melike it
was all okay

No alternative

COLE pops the SPIDER in his mouth and swallows

it as JEFFREY prattles on

JEFFREY

What about the germs I say He
goes I dont believe in germs Germs
are just a plot they made up so they
can sell you disinfectants and soap
Now hes crazy right Hey you
believe in germs dont you

COLE

Im not crazy

JEFFREY

Of course not I never thought you were
You want to escape right Thats very

sane

I can help you You want me to

dont you Get you out

COLE

If you know how to escape why dont you

JEFFREY

Why dont I escape thats what you
were going to ask me right Cause
Id be crazy to escape Im all taken

care of

COLE

Whats that mean

JEFFREY

Ive managed to contact certain underlings
evil spirits secretaries of secretaries and
assorted minions who will contact my father
When he learns Im in this kind of place
hell have them transfer me to one of those
classy joints where they treat youproperly
LIKE A GUEST LIKE A PERSON SHEETS

LIKE A BIG HOTEL WITH GREAT DRUGS

FOR THE NUT CASE LUNATIC MANIAC DEVILS

PATIENTS are waking up as the NURSE and two ORDERLIES burst into the
dorm and head straight for JEFFREY whos struggling to calm himself
JEFFREY
Sorry Really sorry Got a little
agitated The thought of escaping
crossed my mind and suddenlysuddenly
I felt LIKE BENDING THE FUCKING BARS
BACK RIPPING OFF THE GODDAMN WINDOW
FRAMES ANDEATING THEM YES EATING

COLE watches the ORDERLIES grab JEFFREY and haul him away

JEFFREY

Wiping cut the human race Thats a
great idea But its more of a long

What are you talking about

JEFFREY
You know -- your plan

As COLE stares befuddled JEFFREY sees COLES magazine

JEFFREY

INT CORRIDORCOUNTY HOSPITAL

Stepping through the door COLE finds himself in an ante-room
facing several elevators

A uniformed SECURITY MAN sitting at a near-by desk doesnt even
lock up from the magazine hes reading

Barely daring to breathe COLE steps toward the elevators so his
back is to the SECURITY MAN But he doesnt know how to control
this elevator What should he do

SECURITY MANS VOICE (os)

COLE freezes sneaks a glance over his shoulder

COLES POV the SECURITY MAN continues his reading Hes a big

like the MENACING GUARD IN THE FUTURESCARFACE

ANGLE ON COLE stunned

Just then an elevator door slides open The elevators empty

COLE steps into it

INT ELEVATORCOUNTY HOSPITAL

The door closes isolating COLE in the elevator
COLE finds the down button is about to push it when the elevator
springs to life The numbers on the indicator over the door

start to rise 789

Then the elevator stops and the door opens

Two DOCTORS and an AIDE stand in front of the door waiting

COLE hesitates

They look at him They seem to expect him to exit

Avoiding eye contact COLE exits the elevator

As they enter the elevator the DOCTORS look back at COLE and frown

INT RAILLYS OFFICE - MORNING

RAILLY has just arrived for work Shes slipping on her white
doctors coat when

DR CASEY one of the other residents sticks his head in the
door waving a crayoned message on a page torn from a magazine

DR CASEY
This was in my box but I have a slight
suspicion it wasnt meant for me

CASEY enters the room reading the scrawled words dramatically

DR CASEY

I was just

DR FLETCHER
He should have been in restraints It
was bad judgment on your part plain
and simple why not just cop to it

RAILLY
Okay it was bad judgment But I have
the strangest feeling about him -- Ive

seen him somewhere and

DR FLETCHER
(impatient not interested)
Two policemen were already in the
hospital and now we have an orderly
with a broken arm and a Security
Officer with a fractured skull

RAILLY
I said it was bad judgment What else
do you want me to say

INT CONCOURSEAIRPORT - DAY (THE DREAM)

Seen through the glass windows a 747 takes off climbing into
the sky as the airport PA System drones

YOUNG COLE watching the 747 whirls at the SOUND of a COMMOTION
MR PONYTAIL bumps him
The BLONDE MAN sprints past The WOMANS VOICE calls out

WOMANS VOICE

TRAVELERS dive for cover briefly revealing the mysterious BRUNETTE
running after the BLONDE MAN But this time YOUNG COLE catches
just a glimpse of her face She looks a little like RAILLY except
for the dark hair the make-up and the flashy earrings She
calls out her VOICE blending weirdly with the PA SYSTEM

INT ENGINEERING OFFICE - ETERNAL NIGHT OF THE FUTURE

As COLE blinks awake the digitized monotone of the PA SYSTEM
continues to drone in an unearthly VOICE

UNEARTHLY VOICEPA SYSTEM

COLES eyes seek the source of the sound and find it on the table
in front of the panel of disapproving SCIENTISTS facing him Its
a beat-up old tape recorder
UNEARTHLY VOICETAPE RECORDER
I cant do anything more The Police
are after me

The tape ends runs off the reel flapflapflap

completely zoned out

ASTROPHYSICIST
Cole did you or did you not record
that message

COLE
Uh that messageme

MICROBIOLOGIST
Its a digital reconstruction of a
message Cole from a weak signal on our
contact number Did you make that call

COLE
(angrily)
I couldnt call You sent me to the
wrong year It was 1989

SCIENTISTS
1989

The SCIENTISTS react exchanging looks whispers Then

ZOOLOGIST
Youre certain of that

GEOLOGIST
(before Cole can answer)
What did you do with your time Cole
Did you waste it on drugs Women

COLE
They forced me to take drugs

BOTANIST
Forced you Why would someone force
you to take drugs

COLE
I got into trouble I got arrested
But I still got you a specimen -- a

spider -- but I didnt have anyplace to
put it so I ate it It was the wrong
year anyway so I guess it doesnt matter

The SCIENTISTS stare incredulously then turn exchange knowing
looks huddle start whispering to one another

Struggling to stay awake COLE sees blurrily the MICROBIOLOGIST
staring at COLE intently For one moment the face belongs to
DR FLETCHER

COLE blinks hardand the MICROBIOLOGIST has his own face again
COLES head slumps forward nowand everything goes dark

ZOOLOGIST
Did you see it

COLE
Uh no sir Tl

Another slide CLICKS into place Youthful PROTESTERS their
placards featuring slogans and images of Animal Atrocities
confront POLICE in riot gear

ASTROPHYSICIST
What about these people Did you see
any of these people

Zooming in panning the SCIENTISTS emphasize the FACES of the
PROTESTERS The FACES are unfamiliar to COLE (though WE will
recognize some of them later on)

COLE (os)
Uh no sir Iwait

The image pans back to a much enlarged blurry FACE among the
PROTESTERS In spite of the poor image the expression of rage
is clear and it seems to resemble a somewhat older JEFFREY MASON

ASTROPHYSICIST
Him You saw that man

COLE
Uh I think so In the mental hospital
MICRO3IOLOGIST
(switching on the light)
You were in a mental institution

The SCIENTISTS MUTTER disapprovingly among themselves

EXT COLLEGE CAMPUS - NIGHT

Stunningly quiet We are on a placid campus looking at the
dignified architecture of Breitrose Hall MOVING IN we FOCUS ON

Miksztal on Biological Ethics etc) until we SETTLE ON

DR KATHRYN RAILLY
MADNESS AND APOCALYPTIC VISIONS
MAY 17

INT AUDITORIUMBREITROSE HALL - NIGHT

A large screen dominates the auditorium stage On the screen is

a slide of an engraving from the Middle Ages showing a MADMAN in

apparent agony his mouth shaped to a scream as he is restrained
by PEASANTS The projector ZOOMS slowly in on the agonized FACE

of this MADMAN as we HEAR RAILLYS VOICE lecturing
RAILLYS VOICE (os)
According to the accounts of local
officials at that time this gentleman
judged to be about forty years of age
appeared suddenly in the village of Wyle
near Stonehenge in the West of England in
April of 1162 Using unfamiliar words and
speaking in a strange accent the man made
dire prognostications about a pestilence
which he predicted would wipe out humanity
in approximately 800 years Deranged and
hysterical the man raped a young woman of the
village was taken into custody but then
mysteriously escaped and was not heard of again

WE DISCOVER RAILLY six years older now standing at a lectern
in a pool of light Shes dwarfed by the giant screen where the
engraving is replaced by a series of slides of woodcuts showing
scenes of pestilence in the Middle Ages as she lectures to an
audience of mostly SCHOLARLY TYPES

RAILLY (cont)
In 1841 Mackay wrote During seasons
of great pestilence men have often
believed the prophecies of crazed
fanatics that the end of the world was
come Obviously this plaguedoomsday
scenario is considerably more compelling
when reality supports it in some form
whether its the Bubonic Plague smallpox
or AIDS In addition to these natural
contagions there are now technological
horrors as well besides radiation
consider our lurking fear of germ
warfare and its close approximation
chemical warfare which first reared
its ugly head in the deadly mustard
gas attacks during the First World War

ON THE SCREEN a SERIES of SLIDES show images of WORLD WAR I
SOLDIERS in gas masks in death throes etc

RAILLYS VOICE (cont os)
During such an attack in the French
trenches in October 1917 we have an
account of this soldier

ON THE SCREEN a slide of an old deteriorated photograph shows
JOSE the Puerto Rican kid strapped to a stretcher being carried
by SOLDIERS through the trenches during an attack JOSE appears

to be ranting madly as the projector ZOOMS CLOSER on his face until
the image approximates Munchs famous painting

RAILLYS VOICE (cant os)
-- who during an assault was wounded
by shrapnel and hospitalized behind the
lines where Doctors discovered he had
lost all comprehension of French but
spoke English fluently albeit ina
regional dialect they didnt recognize
The man although physically unaffected
by the gas was hysterical He claimed
he had come from the future that he was
looking for a pure germ that would
ultimately wipe mankind off the face of
the earth in the year 1995

The AUDIENCE gives a nervous CHUCKLE

ON THE SCREEN a different old photograph of JOSE This time
hes in a military hospital gaunt haunted very ill

RAILLYS VOICE (cont os)

Although seriously injured the young
soldier disappeared from the hospital
before more data could be gathered No
doubt he was trying to carry on his
mission to warn others substituting

for the agony of wara self-inflicted
agony we call the Cassandra Complex

As RAILLY continues we SCAN the AUDIENCE and DISCOVER MARILOU MARTIN
RAILLYS friend and MARILOUS HUSBAND WAYNE CHANG both listening
attentively Further away another MAN listens intently A MAN with
shoulder-length carrot-colored hair His name is DR PETERS

RAILLY (cont)
Cassandra in Greek legend you will recall
was condemned to know the future but to be
disbelieved when she foretold it Hence
the agony of foreknowledge combined with
impotence to do anything about it

INT RECEPTION ROOM - AN HOUR LATER (NIGHT)

A stack of new books THE DOOMSDAY SYNDROME Apocalyptic
Visions of the Mentally Ill by Dr Kathryn Railly

Surrounded by enthusiastic members of the audience RAILLY is
seated at the table signing books but DR PETERS has her ear

DR PETERS
I think Dr Railly you have given
your alarmists a bad name Surely
there is very real and very convincing
data that the planet cannot survive the
excesses of the human race proliferation
of atomic devices uncontrolled breeding
habits the rape of the environment the
pollution of land sea and air In this
context isnt it obvious that Chicken
Little represents the sane vision and
that Homo Sapiens motto Lets go
shopping is the cry of the true lunatic
DR PETERS smiles self-importantly at RAILLY as an elderly
disheveled PROFESSOR elbows in front of him

DISHEVELED PROFESSOR
Doctor Railly -- please I wonder if
youre aware of my own studies which
indicate that certain cycles of the
moon actually impact on the incidence
of apocalyptic predictions as observed
in urban emergency rooms and

As the PROFESSOR babbles MARILOU MARTIN and her husband WAYNE
CHANG appear and whisper

MARILOU
You were great

RAILLY
Youre leaving

MARILOU
The reservations at nine thirty --
its getting late

DISHEVELED PROFESSOR
Doctor Railly -- please -- this is very
important

WAYNE CHANG
(checking the professor)
You sure youre gonna be all right

RAILLY
(smiles checks her watch)

Ill be there in twenty minutes

DISHEVELED PROFESSOR
Dr Railly I simply cannot understand
your exclusion of the moon in relation
to apocalyptic dementia

The outside lights of Breitrose Hall go off

RAILLY seems to be alone in the lot as she fishes keys from her
purse unlocks her car door starts to open it when
Suddenly shes grabbed from behind in a choke-hold by a large
shadowy MAN looming out of the darkness behind her

As she makes the turn RAILLY glances in the rear view mirror
sees him unfolding a tattered map His face is lost in darkness

but she glimpses ragged torn clothing as he tries to read the
map by the intermittent glow of passing street lights

RAILLY obeys She glances in the mirror again hesitates then
boldly switches on the dome light holding her breath fearfully
for his reaction

He grunts appreciatively Relieved she looks in the mirror
again trying to get a better look at him but now his features
are concealed by the map

RAILLY
If you make me go with you its
kidnapping Thats a serious crime
If you let me go you could just take
the car and

MAN

underground when I was nine I told you
that When you come to the corner

Hes lowered the map Its COLE Haggard unshaven dirty

COLE
Its the next step I checked out the
Baltimore information it was nothing
Its Philadelphia thats where they
are the ones who killed everyone

Zs that a radio Does it play music

RAILLY turns on the radio and immediately WE HEAR the SOUND of SURF
and the CRIES of gulls background to an oozing baritone COMMERCIAL

COLE sits up alert listening intently

COLES eyes narrow concentrating on this personal message

COLE frowns as the SOUND of breaking SURF and crying GULLS fills
the car Its confusing He blurts out

COLE
Ive never seen the ocean

Observing his confusion in the mirror RAILLY assumes her
professional tone

RAILLY
Its an advertisement Mr Cole You
do understand that dont you Its
not really a special message to you

COLE frowns He did think it was for him but shes probably right

COLE
You used to call me James

RAILLY
Youd prefer that Jamesyou

COLE
(cynical laugh)
Everybodys got a gun In this city

He breaks off reacting to the RADIO MUSIC FATS DOMINO singing
BLUEBERRY HILL COLE grins mouth agape eyes wide like a kids

COLE

love hearing twentieth century music
Hearing music and breathing air

As RAILLY cranks up the volume she watches the mirror
incredulously sees him stick his head out the window into the
wind mouth open eating the air hungrily

Young Neuman apparently stepped into an
abandoned well shaft and is lodged somewhere
in the narrow 150 foot pipe possibly alive

COLE turns to RAILLY beside him on the bed frightened and
helpless her jacket arranged to restrain her like a strait-jacket

COLES instinct is to free her at once but he controls his
impulse He looks away gets up and wincing limps to the
dresser stepping around empty fast-food cartons He pulls a
razor and shaving soap from a paper bag then goes into the
bathroom leaving the door open and starts to shave

COLE

who survived can go back to the surface
of the earth

RAILLY maintains a professional deadpan says nothing as they pass
a pickup truck with a MOTHER FATHER and five KIDS in the back

Clueless RAILLY stares at the wall then at COLE

COLE touches a bit of red-stenciled graffiti hidden under gang
insignias We can just see TWELVE MONKEYS holding hands in a circle

COLE
The Twelve Monkeys Theyre here
(looks around)
Somewhere Come on

He pulls her along the sidewalk No question hes insane
At the next alley entrance COLE stops abruptly Then still
keeping a firm grip on RAILLYS arm he starts ripping down newly

tacked-up posters announcing a Rap concert

RAILLY stares at him then turns and is looking all around when
suddenly COLE pulls her up tight and threatens

COLE
Look Im warning you You do anything
Im going to go crazy -- hurt people
RAILLY

Im not going to do anything I
promise But you need help James
None of this is what you think it is

ANGLE ON COLE not listening staring triumphantly Hes found
another partially obscured stencil of THE TWELVE MONKEYS

But just then a raspy VOICE startles COLE

RASPY VOICE You cant hide from them Bob

COLE whirls sees a derelict LOUIE leering at him speaking ina
voice eerily like the RASPY VOICE from the next cell in the future

LOUIE
No sir Old Bob -- dont even try
(conspiratorially)
They hear everything They got that
tracking device on you They can find
you anywhere Anytime Ha Ha

RAILLY looks from LOUIS to COLE sees COLES stunned reaction

CRACKHEADS huddle against a building sucking their pipes
oblivious to COLE pulling RAILLY past

COLE scans the walls for messages in the confusion of graffiti

RAILLY is considering her surroundings dubiously when suddenly
COLE pulls her toward the mouth of a dark and forbidding alley

RAILLY
James no -- we shouldnt be here

COLE ignores her yanking her after him into the alley

INT DARK ALLEY - DAY

RAILLY tries to stop but COLE intent on the wall messages
doesnt notice the THUGS

The TWO THUGS turn and spot COLE and RAILLY moving toward them
These creeps have mean eyes predator faces
RAILLY digs her heels in forcing COLE to stop

RAILLY
James We have to go back Those men

Too late While COLE turns and stares at her uncomprehending
the TWO THUGS are approaching

FIRST THUG
Hey buddy

Startled COLE turns to face them

The SECOND THUG lunges for RAILLYS purse yanks it from her
COLE reaches to grab it back butWHACK The FIRST THUG smacks
COLE hard across the face with something metallic

Bloody-faced dazed COLE doesnt even have a chance to clear his
head as the FIRST THUG shoves the hard object against COLES
cheek Its a cheap thirty-eight pistol

RAILLY turns to run gets two steps before the SECOND THUG knocks
her roughly to the ground

SECOND THUG
Stick around bitch

Looming over her the SECOND THUG starts to unzip his fly
RAILLY looks over to COLE SEES

COLE dropping to his knees groveling at the FIRST THUGS feet

COLE
Please Please dont hurt me

The FIRST THUG steps close kicks COLE contemptuously cocks his
foot for a second kick when

COLE uncoils lunging rising his strong arms around the bigger
mans calves lifting him mightily high off the ground

The gun FIRES wildly as COLE staggers forward with the FIRST THUG
in his arms and smashes the man into the brick wail behind him
The FIRST THUG goes down in a heap dropping the pistol

Zipping his fly hastily the SECOND THUG turns to deal with COLE
but COLE attacks himrocking him again and again with savage
blows that come one after another with lightning speed The SECOND
THUG staggers back bloody and dazed as RAILLY watches amazed

Turning back to the FIRST THUG COLE sees the MAN reaching for
the dropped pistol

COLE kicks him viciously in the jaw The FIRST THUGS head whips
back SNAP He collapses against the brick wall

COLE turns back to see the SECOND THUG retreating down the alley
as fast as he can stagger

RAILLY stares up at COLE He looks very dangerous He glances
in her direction as he pockets the pistol

COLE
Are you hurt

RAILLY
Uh no Yes I mean just some scrapes

As RAILLY gets to her feet she sees COLE bend over the
motionless THUG and quickly go through his pockets
RAILLY
Is healive

COLE ignores the question as he pockets the mans wallet anda
handful of bullets then turns and snaps at RAILLY

COLE
Come an Were running out of time
You cant help him

As COLE yanks her roughly away she looks back sees the FIRST
THUGS sightless eyes wide openstaring blankly

RAILLY

around frantically for an explanation for the tropical downpour

Bookshelves line two walls The front window is blanked cut with
posters of Animal Rights demonstrations newspaper clippings
photos of animal atrocities The fourth wall features the
counter where the three ACTIVISTS face COLE as a JUNGLE BIRD

ineffectual liberal jerkoffs He
wanted to do guerrilla actions to
educate the public

COLE holds up a clipping showing horrified SENATORS standing on
their desks as RATTLESNAKES slither along the Senate Floor

MASON rises to the enthusiastic applause of the GUESTS

DR MASON
Would that I could enjoy this opulent
dinner and this excellent and
stimulating company for itself with no
sense of purpose But alas I am
burdened with the sense that with all
this excess of public attention and
this cacophony of praise there comes
great responsibility Indeed I
practically feel a soapbox growing
under my feet whenever I stand for more
than a few seconds

While GUESTS laugh at DR MASONS last remark SECRET SERVICE
AGENT 3 enters the room scowling looking for someone

DR MASON (os)
The dangers of science are a time worn
threat from Prometheus stealing fire
from the Gods to the Cold War era of
the Dr Strangelove Terror

AGENT 3 spots who hes looking for JEFFREY MASON

DR MASON (cont)
But never before not even at Los Alamos
when the scientists made bets on whether
their first atomic bomb test would wipe out
New Mexico has science given us so much
reason to fear the power we have at hand
ANGLE ON JEFFREY as AGENT 3 whispers in his ear

JEFFREY
What are you talking about What
friend Im not expecting anyone

ANGLE ON DR MASON reacting with irritation to the disturbance

DR MASON
Current genetic engineering as well as

You think maybe Im the one who wiped
out the human race It was my idea

Nobody is going to wipe out the human
race Not you or Jeffrey or anybody
else Youve created something in your
mind James -- a substitute reality

In order to avoid something you dont
want to face

Immentally divergent I would
love to believe that

It can be dealt with but only if you
want to I can help you

First its important that you
surrender to them instead of them
catching you running Okay

Im afraid this doesnt seem very
professional to me in fact its
distressingly unprofessional for some-
one who treated my son briefly (if
indeed you actually are who you say you
are) to take a sudden unsolicited interest
in his mental health six years later
and to telephone a parent to express
opinions that would be inappropriate

(breaks off listens then)
I dont know anything about Monkey
armies Doctor Nothing whatsoever

If my son ever was involved in
(listens then )

It would be doubly inappropriate to

discuss matters of security with you

Dr Railly but if it will put you at

ease neither my son nor any other

unauthorized person has access to any

potentially dangerous organisms in this

various fading photos and newspaper clippings tacked on the wall

BOTANIST
Lets consider again our current
information -- if the symptoms were

first detected in Philadelphia on June
28 1995 that makes us know that

COLE
It was released in Philadelphia

probably on June 14 1995

BOTANIST
And it appeared sequentially after that
in

With a quick glance at the panel of SCIENTISTS staring at him

from behind the long table

COLE
San Francisco New Orleans Rio de
Janeiro Rome Kinshasa Karachi
Bangkok then Peking

BOTANIST
Meaning

COLE
That the virus was taken from Philadelphia
to San Francisco then to New Orleans
Rio de Janeiro Rome Kinshasa Karachi
Bangkok then Peking

BOTANIST
And your only goal is

COLE
To find out where the virus is so a
qualified scientist can travel back into
the past and study the original virus

BOTANIST
So that

COLE
Uh so that a vaccine can be developed
that will uh allow mankind to reclaim
the surface of the earth

COLE replies like a good pupil

COLE glances nervously at the suspicious SCIENTISTS as the
BOTANIST switches on a slide projector and projects

a magazine photo of wall graffiti ATTENTION
WATCHING IS THERE A VIRUS IS THIS THE SOURCE

BOTANIST (os)
This is from a magazine printed in late
September 1995 The writer speculated
that this graffiti might be related to
the epidemic that by that time had
already killed thirty million people
world-wide and was getting worse He
says certain people unnamed were
questioned but what came of that is not
known But it is a clue you should pursue

With a quick glance toward the PLAINCLOTHES COP RAILLY takes
urgent charge of the situation

ANGLE on RAILLY desperately pulling COLES hands off his head as
she tries to block the COPS view of COLE

RAILLY
James -- put your hands down and listen

ANGLE ON THE PLAINCLOTHES COP checking the mug shot of COLE on
his clipboard then reaching for his radio mike

ANGLE ON RAILLY reacting to the COP speaking into his mike she
tosses the spray paint can aside grabs COLE and tries to pull
him alongbut COLE isnt moving Hes staring at the front of
the FAA Store with disbelief

RAILLY
James come on We have to get out of here

COLE looks from the wall to the can rolling on the sidewalk
then back to the wall where RAILLY has sprayed the huge words

Wow a guy in a Chevy is chasing her

FALE

Hey no problem its probably just
another kidnapping featuring Jeffreys
shrink pardon me make that ex-shrink

(indicating Jeffrey to the others
This is your leader a certifiable lunatic
who told his former psychiatrist all his
plans for God knows what whacko irresponsible
schemes and now who knows what shes
painted out there on our wall

JEFFREY

WHO CARES WHAT PSYCHIATRISTS WRITE ON
WALLS

(moves to Fale jabs him with a finger)
You think I told her about the Army of
the 12 Monkeys Impossible Know why
you pathetically ineffectual and
pusillanimous pretend-friend-to-
animals Ill tell you why because
when I had anything to do with her six
years ago there was no such thing -- I
hadnt even thought of it yet

FALE
(triumphant)
Then how come she knows whats going on

JEFFREY abruptly switches from rage to good humor adopting a
supercilious smile and a patronizing tone

JEFFREY
Heres my theory on that While I was
institutionalized my brain was studied
exhaustively in the guise of mental health
I was interrogated x-rayed studied
thoroughly Then everything about me
was entered into a computer where they
created a model of my mind
They all stare mesmerized at the strutting JEFFREY Is he
serious Is he crazy Doesnt matter -- hes charismatic

JEFFREY (cont)
Then using the computer model they
generated every thought I could possibly
have in the next say ten years which
they then filtered through a probability
matrix to determine everything I was
going to do in that period So you
see she knew I was going to lead the
Army of the Twelve Monkeys into the
pages of history before it ever even
occurred to me She knows everything
Im ever going to do before I know it
myself How about that

JEFFREY smiles smugly into FALES flabbergasted face
JEFFREY
Now I have to get going -- do my part
You guys check all this stuff out and
load up the van Make sure you have
everything Im outta here

JEFFREY exits The others stare at the door

Is this real -- or is this one of my
delusions
RAILLY

This is definitely real

(to Wallace)
Excuse me I think we have a little
misunderstanding here

wall and onto the floor as WALLACE spins around to COLE who is
stepping toward him but WALLACE is now holding a knife

WALLACE
Whatre you -- some kind of tough guy
You wanna be a hero You gonna try and
