INT COPY ROOM - DAY

Malcolm stands at the copy machine losing himself in the
repetitive light flashing back and forth across the wall He
munches on a PINK MARSHMALLOW SNOWBALL his snack of choice

PRINCIPAL RICHARD MULLIKEN (30s) enters Even his own
mother calls him a Dick behind his insipid back

PRINCIPAL DICK
Almost done

MALCOLM
Just need a few more minutes Dick

PRINCIPAL DICK
You know Id prefer it if youd
call me Principal Mulliken

No response Dick sets his STACK OF PAPERS down on the
counter The whir of the copy machine underscores--

PRINCIPAL DICK (CONTD)

resentment over the fact that I got

MALCOLM

Dick stares at his expensive precision European WRISTWATCH
He hands Malcolm the stack of papers on his way out

EXT ALTMAN MIDDLE SCHOOL - PARKING LOT - NIGHT

One car -- an old Volvo -- in a sea of empty spaces Malcolm
approaches tie undone UMBRELLA out

He unlocks the driver side door but its JAMMED A gust of
WIND causes his cheap umbrella to fold inside out soaking
Malcolm as he pulls on the car handle Finally

The door FLIES OPEN sending Malcolm tumbling into a puddle
of water Frustrated he tosses the cheap umbrella aside

INT THIRSTY EAR TAVERN - NIGHT

A dim half-full bar In the corner booth three young
CAREER WOMEN laugh loudly Malcolm at the bar turns away
from them his attention on a TELEVISION showing--

A NIGHTLY NEWS GRAPHIC of tonights winning Lotto numbers

Malcolm crumples up a LOTTERY TICKET and deposits it in his
empty beer mug A MAILMAN waddles to the bar taking a seat
beside Malcolm On and off the job JERRY BRACK is postal

JERRY
How come you didnt check on me

MALCOLM
In the bathroom

JERRY
I thought youd be a little more
worried I was in there for a

Jerry notices the crumpled lottery ticket

JERRY
You didnt lose her Malcolm
Youre on a break And Im ona
break from hearing about it

MALCOLM
A girl like that What she ever
saw in me Ill never know

JERRY
Its a mystery for the ages

Malcolm looks back at the table of career women now chatting
with two svelte SUITS six-figure salaries are a turn on

MALCOLM
She could have any guy she wanted
Maybe this break is her way of
saying its time to move on to a
man who can actually provide

JERRY

You know what your problem is You
embrace depression Take my job
for example I only stick with it
‘cause someday I know a giant
meteor will fall from the sky and
crush all my co-workers I live
for that day

(beat)
Now ya see Gotta look on the
bright side of things

MALCOLM
I cant afford to look on the
bright side Not with my job

Malcolm dumps the crumpled lottery ticket from the beer cup
into his hand Staring at it

MALCOLM (CONTD)
Dont you wish you didnt have to
think about money anymore The
problems that would solve No more
caring about getting promoted No
more worrying about whether a
girls out of your league No more
sitting in soaked underwear at a
two-bit bar drinking cheap beer

lottery ticket

He takes the crumpled ticket and tosses it into a garbage can
behind the bar Swish

JERRY
Well let me run to the car and grab
my time machine Well go back

balls

Malcolm laughs patting Jerry on the shoulder as

One of the career gals from the booth approaches the bar
Jerry notices nudging Malcolm into saying something

MALCOLM

EXTEST MALCOLMS HOUSE - NIGHT
The same house we saw in the opening except more ramshackle
It sits back on a grassy patch of land The neighbors are

spread out This place was probably nice Once

Its raining heavily now So heavily in fact that a
SHINGLE blows off the roof and smashes to the ground

INT MALCOLMS HOUSE - SAME
The layout is loft style with the entry hall kitchen and
living room all open and connected Furnishings are sparse

A hall leads off to the bedroom and bath

The front door unlocks and Malcolm wipes his feet He sets
his bag down next to a bookshelf where he quietly admires

TROPHIES PICTURES PLAQUES
All of which seem to be in recognition of EXCELLENCE IN

TEACHING A FRAMED PICTURE of Malcolm and Daisy holding up
teaching commendations sits in the center

Malcolm picks up the picture and rubs his hand over the
glass Remembering the good ol days

Flipping channels Malcolm finds one playing WEST SIDE STORY
PUERTO RICANS (ON TELEVISION)

I like to be in America

Okay by me in America

Evrything free in America

For a small fee in America
Exhausted from another long day the REFLECTION of Bernstein
and Sondheims Capitalistic debate dances over Malcolms
drooping eyes As soon as his lids close
Drip Drip Drip

A LEAK has formed in the ceiling splattering to the wood
floor in perfect rhythm to the West Side Story ballet

INT LIVING ROOM - HOURS LATER

The television now displays a late night INFOMERCIAL We
still hear the Drip Drip of the water leak

Malcolm a puddle of drool staining the couch pillow slowly
awakens He sits up setting his feet down SPLASH

THE HARDWOOD FLOOR IS FLOODED

SIGHING Malcolm splatters through the water unsure what to
do He stands under the leak pants soaked looking up--

CRASH
The soggy floor GIVES without notice under Malcolms WEIGHT

Malcolm DROPS up to his waist creating a perfect HOLE in the
floor Drip The leak now lands SPLAT on Malcolms head

And then it doesnt Malcolm looks The leak has STOPPED

MALCOLM

EXT ALTMAN MIDDLE SCHOOL - PARKING LOT - MORNING

Thermos of coffee in hand Malcolm gets out of his clunker of
a car As he heads for the back entrance a brand spankin
new blue BMW pulls into a spot marked RESERVED

Principal Dick gets out of the car looking like he thinks he
looks like a million bucks Malcolm gapes Dick notices--

PRINCIPAL DICK
Like the new car I just came into
some cash Shes a beaut Here
Touch it

MALCOLM
I dont need to touch it

PRINCIPAL DICK
Touch the car McCree

Malcolm touches the car And with that Dick walks away
Then as an afterthought--

PRINCIPAL DICK (CONTD)
Oh and Malcolm Weve got a local
news crew coming to do a story on

imperative we build public trust in
public schools

Standing a distance away are Malcolm and his class Malcolm
watches Daisy then glances over to Scott Skeptical

MALCOLM
Richie Rich probably sends his kids
to some boarding school

Malcolm goes back to eyeing Daisy As if feeling his gaze
she turns and waves on habit Malcolm smiles bashfully

DIPLOMA from Dartmouth Notices he also has a framed picture

from ten years earlier of all the brothers in ALPHA TAU
EPSILON fraternity Beta chapter

Principal Dick enters holding a rolled-up newspaper
adjusting his belt buckle

PRINCIPAL DICK
Lets simply rip this Band-Aid off

Malcolm sits up This doesnt sound good at all

PRINCIPAL DICK (CONTD)

INT HALLWAY - OUTSIDE DAISYS CLASSROOM - LATER

Through the glass door pane Daisy grades tests at her desk
Malcolm AIMLESSLY wanders past her door He stops

INT SCIENCE CLASSROOM - CONTINUOUS
Daisy looks up from grading and sees Malcolm outside

He comes in sitting down at one of the too-small STUDENT
DESKS STUNNED silent from his meeting with Dick

Daisy sighs setting down her pen next to a CELLPHONE

DAISY
Were taking a break Malcolm
That means were not supposed to be
talking

Malcolm stares off eyes unfocused Beat

MALCOLM
I love these rules Who invented
these rules Is there a book or
instruction manual that perhaps I
could purchase informing me of
these rules

DAISY
Malcolm

MALCOLM
This is insane We teach 8th
grade We all shouldnt be acting
like were still in it

Its directed at Principal Dicks behavior as much as it is
Daisys Daisy moves over to a neighboring student desk

DAISY
I just need time to think You
said you understood

MALCOLM
I lied I dont understand What
do you need to think about What
could possibly be causing you
reservations

She debates whether to answer

DAISY
Alright look Heres the
problem

MALCOLM

--Its the future isnt it

DAISY
Well yeah But let me

Daisys cellphone RINGS the theme from Reading Rainbow

MALCOLM
You can answer it

DAISY

Beat as they let it finish ringing Malcolm is now

calmer his voice is softer

MALCOLM

Ever since you started here

started but now they couldnt care
less ‘matter how hard I try No

--Daisys cellphone rings again Reading Rainbow

MALCOLM (CONTD)
OH FOR GODS SAKE

Waist too big Malcolm STRUGGLES from the tiny desk carrying
it several feet before SQUEEZING out He grabs Daisys cell

MALCOLM (CONTD)
Hello No this is her phone

Malcolm puts the phone back Daisy looks concerned

MALCOLM (CONTD)

He throws his palms out a consolatory gesture

MALCOLM

Malcolms heading for the door HEARTBROKEN

MALCOLM

restaurant in town Thats what

He opens the door but turns back --

MALCOLM (CONTD)
Youre gonna probably wanna go
business casual

Daisy watches Malcolm go
INT HISTORY CLASSROOM - DAY
Malcolm stands at the chalkboard SCRATCHING IT

Though he has a zen-like look -- eyes closed -- the entire
class COVERS their ears in pain Then out of his zone

MALCOLM
Still no one No one can tell me
why October 29th 1929 is
considered important Ill give
you a hint Something bad began on
that day

The entire class is blank Malcolm sighs and writes out
MALCOLM (CONTD)
The great depression Black

Tuesday Kind of like today

The door to the classroom opens and Isaac too cool for
school strides in with pants sagging Gangsta style

MALCOLM (CONTD)
Isaac why are you twenty minutes
late

ISAAC
Does it matter I miss anything

Malcolm puts his piece of white chalk down He starts
chuckling a demented smile on his face

MALCOLM
Show of hands Who wants to be
here

Nobody raises their hands
MALCOLM (CONTD)
Thats what I thought Now who
doesnt want to be here
He actually raises his hand
MALCOLM (CONTD)
Dont be shy You either wanna be

here or you dont

Isaac raises his hand Slowly one by one the kids follow
their leader until they all have their hands RAISED

MALCOLM (CONTD)
Weve got one thing in common

Malcolm strides around the desks like Monty Hall
MALCOLM (CONTD)
Lets make a deal If you dont
want to learn Im not gonna try to
teach you Theres no reason

He gets right in poor Sarahs face

MALCOLM (CONTD)
All our lives are just one massive
disappointment after another
anyhow

The students are SHOCKED at Malcolms breakdown As Malcolm
goes back to his desk he passes Isaac--

ISAAC
Damn Hate to see whatd happen if
I was twenty-five minutes late

The class laughs grateful for the humor

ON MALCOLM -- At his desk laughter the last thing he needs
right now Slowly it disappears until we are MOS

Malcolm picks up the Youre a Winner sweepstakes letter

revealing a PILE OF GRADED PAPERS The top-most of which has
a big red A next to the authors name--

ISAAC REED Malcolm looks from the A to the A-hole
student This kid is wasting so much potential

The laughter CRASHES back onto the soundtrack Malcolm takes
one look at what his lifes become and unceremoniously DUMPS
the Youre a Winner letter in the trash

PRE-LAP A SHRILL BEEEEEEEP

EXT PARKING LOT - LATER

HIGH ABOVE the entire school a blight on the cityscape
That shrill noise blazing even up here Like a car alarm

EXT MALCOLMS VOLVO - CONTINUOUS
THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD the car looks empty BEEEEEEEE

The sound STOPS just as Malcolm RISES into view in the driver
seat His head was on the CAR HORN

He takes in the school Principal Dicks new Beemer then
makes a decision Keys in the ignition

Malcolm puts the car in reverse and sputters out of the
parking lot Today hes the first one to leave

INTEXT MALCOLMS VOLVO - MOVING - DAY

Malcolm heads down a FOUR LANE STREET His engine coughs to
get through a YELLOW LIGHT but doesnt make it

Meanwhile a PORSCHE 911 in the next lane (with a HOT CHICK
in the passenger seat) zooms through at the last second

MOMENTS LATER -- The light turns green Malcolm puts the car
in gear but this thing does zero to 30 in about fourteen
seconds Cars ZIP past in the left lane

He reaches the next green light and it turns yellow
Knowing better Malcolm stops In the left lane a LEXUS
CONVERTIBLE (with TWO hot girls) powers through just in time
Malcolm seethes as he waits through another RED LIGHT
FINALLY The light turns green About fifty feet away from
the NEXT LIGHT Malcolm decides to throttle the car Hes
DETERMINED to make this green light Determined

BOOM

The ENGINE BACKFIRES and Malcolms acceleration dies His
momentum pushes him just to the edge of the CROSSWALK at the
exact same moment the light turns red Of course

In the left lane a STRETCH LIMO with about EIGHT gorgeous
women hanging from various windows blithely disregards safety
and shoots through the intersection

Malcolm leans back and looks out the window at a

SILVER PLATTER SHOP-N-GO

On the sign above the convenience store a cartoon butler
carries a tray of champagne glasses

INT SILVER PLATTER SHOP-N-GO - LATER

The door CHIMES as Malcolm enters The place is empty
Malcolm looks around for the cashier shrugs and starts
grabbing junk food

At the counter he grabs his usual marshmallow snowballs

MALCOLM
Hello

Malcolm checks the back room to get help

MALCOLM (CONTD)
Anybody around

SANJIT (0OS)
Hello my friend How may I help
you

A handsome Indian man appears behind the counter Malcolm
looks around trying to figure out where he came from

MALCOLM
Um I just need this rung up
SANJIT
My name is Sanjit You come in
often
MALCOLM

No First time

SANJIT
Can I interest you in a lottery
ticket my friend This weeks

Malcolm hands Sanjit his CREDIT CARD

MALCOLM
Sure why

He stops A sudden realization

MALCOLM (CONTD)
Actually no Forget it Whats
the point I was born to envy

While SANJIT rings up the other purchases

SANJIT
You know my friend I respect
that Youre a man who does not
care whether he is wealthy in

money am I correct Only Im
guessing wealthy in love and
respect

MALCOLM

Youre 0 for 3
Sanjit slides the credit card the machine BEEPS

SANJIT
Oh my friend Im terribly sorry

The machine flashes DECLINED

MALCOLM
How much was all my stuff

SANJIT
Eight dollars and seventeen cents
my friend

MALCOLM
My card was declined for eight
dollars and seventeen cents

SANJIT
I apologize in advance

Sanjit takes SCISSORS to Malcolms credit card But instead
of cutting it into pieces he cuts out a tiny VISA DOLPHIN

SANJIT (CONTD)
I find it makes people less angry

Sanjit hands over the remnant of the credit card Malcolm
digs into his pocket looking for cash He has none

MALCOLM
Forget it Just my luck

Malcolm stuffs his pockets back into his pants and heads for
the door Sanjit calls after him

SANJIT
My friend you know what I do for
you I give you ticket on Sanjit

Sanjit goes to the lottery machine and prints out a ticket

MALCOLM
Really its okay I dont need

SANJIT
--No It is fine You my friend

Malcolm smiles accepting the lottery ticket As hes
walking out Malcolm notes the numbers on the LOTTERY TICKET

12 3 4 5 (MEGA NUMBER) 6

MALCOLM
Youve got to be kidding me

The bell chimes as Malcolm opens the door

SANJIT
I feel you going to be lucky my
friend

MALCOLM
0 for 4

EXT SILVER PLATTER SHOP-N-GO - CONTINUOUS

Malcolm takes another look at the lottery ticket Scoffs
He turns to a crazy HOMELESS LADY stationed outside

MALCOLM
You want a lottery ticket

HOMELESS LADY
I dont gamble

More gumdrops moose

INT MALCOLMS HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Malcolm lounges on his ratty sofa He pours himself a shot
of cheap rum as a NEWS TEAM report ON THE TELEVISION --

MALE ANCHOR (ON TELEVISION)
Theres a common product in your
house right now And it might
kill you Well let you know what
it is in a moment

An open pack of snowballs on Malcolms coffee table sit next
to a common bottle of WINDEX and a DURACELL battery Huh

FEMALE ANCHOR (ON TELEVISION)
And stay tuned for tonights lotto
drawing after these commercials

THE NEWS CUTS TO --

The Scott Scotterson CAMPAIGN AD from before opening with a
powerful shot of Scott at the CAPITOL BUILDING in Washington

SCOTT (ON TELEVISION)

this message

ON MALCOLM shooting off the sofa

MALCOLM
Bathroom break

INT LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

A TOILET FLUSHES (OS) and Malcolm trudges back to the living
room right as the news comes back from commercial--

FEMALE ANCHOR (ON TELEVISION)
We go live now to Rachel Olson-
Trapp at lottery headquarters

AT LOTTERY HQ perky redhead RACHEL OLSON-TRAPP stands beside
a familiar lottery machine with WHITE BALLS bouncing around

RACHEL (ON TELEVISION)
Good evening Tonights jackpot is
87 million Good luck

She hits a button on the machine and the first ball pops up

RACHEL (CONTD)
And the first number is one
How appropriate

Back on the sofa Malcolm barely registers the first number

RACHEL (CONTD)
The second number is Its a two
Wow So far we have one and two
In that order

Malcolm takes notice as he sips his drink The third white
ball pops up and Rachel grabs it She is noticeably
speechless The number is 3

RACHEL (CONTD)
Um The third number is three

At three Malcolm really pays attention He finds the
lottery ticket in his pocket Waits for ball 4 Its

RACHEL (CONTD)
A four Youve got to be is
this a joke

Rachel looks off to the wings of the studio for an answer

Malcolm -- with four numbers -- gets right up to the screen
Kneeling he holds his ticket so very tightly praying

RACHEL (CONTD)
Okay Here comes number five
Ladies and gentlemen I assure you
this has not been rigged

Shaking Malcolms eyes are seconds from popping out of his
skull The final ball shoots up

RACHEL (CONTD)
And the Mega number for this weeks
Mega Millions is SIX--
--Malcolm goes APESHIT He whoops and hollers
RACHEL (CONTD)
--TEEN Sixteen Wow That would

have been something

As this registers Malcolm stops cheering He turns back to
the TV where a GRAPHIC displays the winning numbers

12 3 4 5 (MEGA NUMBER) 16

Malcolm sways the light from the newscast dancing over his
now catatonic figure Slowly ever so slowly he turns
his attention to the lottery ticket in his hand--

MALCOLM
You got me SIX teen Boy you
got me Wasnt enough to take away
my pay my self respect my
girlfriend
(beat)
Now you have to steal my soul

He crumples the orange ticket Closes his eyes

MALCOLM (CONTD)
I could have bought a better life

Malcolm grabs the bottle of rum downs the final drops and
alioops the ticket into the gaping hole in the floor

MALCOLM (CONTD)
Swish

And with that the alcohol takes over and he PASSES OUT

applause toward her this evening
Daisy Wise Come on stand up

The table applauds as Daisy stands at the end of the table
She was obscured from Malcolm but he can sure see her now

MALCOLM
NO

The entire table looks to Malcolm and in that instant he
catches Daisys eyes Oh and Scotts eye Singular

ON MALCOLM ignoring SALS HEAD as it THUDS into the plate
beside him Kiki turns and sees her DEAD HUSBAND

KIKI
Oh my God

She looks despondent All attention is now on her and Sal

IRVING HALCOURT
Is he dead

Barely able to contain her excitement through fake tears

KIKI
Yes

EXT CONDO BUILDING - NIGHT

The guests from the dinner have gathered in silent vigil as
the PARAMEDICS cart a BODY BAG into a parked ambulance

Scott and Daisy stand with Halcourt whos distressed more
over the ruined meal than the dead guest

IRVING HALCOURT
We need to have a word

Irving pulls Scott aside
SCOTT
You dont think anyones gonna ask

for their money back

Daisy is left alone as Scott moves out of earshot She looks
over to the bereaved

ON KIKI -- Sniffling in the cold air Miranda has an arm
around her consoling

Malcolm stands a few feet back feeling bad for Kiki

Miranda steps over to Malcolm She isnt upset in the least

MALCOLM
Is she gonna be okay

MIRANDA
Totally

An off-putting answer Malcolm watches his breath
condense in the night air Miranda SIGHS

MIRANDA (CONTD)
I remember when my first husband
died It took like four months
before they read the will Goddamn
kids got almost everything

MALCOLM
What are you talking about

MIRANDA
All Sals bank accounts are already
in Kikis name Shes so lucky

Malcolms eyes burrow through Miranda Hes actually able to
look past the glossy veneer into the soulless interior

MALCOLM
Were breaking up

And he walks away Thats it No argument no nothing

MIRANDA
Malcolm Malcolm

She starts crying A guest thinking shes upset over Sals
death motions to comfort her When she turns we realize
the guest is Ridley Smythe superintendant of schools

A wealthy single man For Miranda its the quickest cure
ON MALCOLM --

Approaching Daisy He comes at her from the side

MALCOLM
You are such a hypocrite

DAISY
I dont want to talk to you

MALCOLM
You get mad at me for dating
someone else and all along you were
seeing that schmuck

Daisy turns angry

DAISY
First off I went out with Scott
once or twice as friends This is
our first date

MALCOLM
Wait Hes the one who called you
that day isnt he

DAISY
--Secondly that schmuck has done
nothing but work tirelessly to help

From over Malcolms shoulder

SCOTT (0S)
Is this guy bothering you

Malcolm comes eye to eye with eye-patched Scotterson

SCOTT (CONTD)

MALCOLM
Apparently contributing to your
campaign matey

Scotts about to pick a fight Regarding his eye patch
SCOTT
Youre the reason I have this
and if I catch you anywhere near my
girlfriend again I will end you

MALCOLM
Arrrr you threatening me

Scott winds up to punch Malcolm but Irving grabs Scotts
arm Backs him off

IRVING HALCOURT
The last thing we need after
tonight is a picture in the papers
of you assaulting a guest

leaving

Malcolm brushes off his jacket He turns to

INT PARKING GARAGE - NIGHT

Deserted Ugly orange lights crisscross support beams
creating long and abundant areas of SHADOW

Malcolm stands in a parking spot checking his watch

FOOTSTEPS echo off the cavernous concrete Malcolm spins
He cant tell where theyre coming from But then they stop

MALCOLM
Hello

FREDDY (0S)
Tupperware

Malcolm whips around to see a trench coated man standing in
shadow by Malcolms new LAMBORGHINI All very DEEP THROAT

We cant see his face -- private eyes have a tendency to keep
just out of the light But we can see his hands holding a
tupperware container of food This PI is hungry

MALCOLM
Mr Brin Freddy Brin

FREDDY
--Keeps food fresher longer
Greatest invention of the 20th
century tupperware is ya ask me

Freddy Brin steps into the light with a DOSSIER This man
who was following Malcolm around is now his private eye

MALCOLM
Thank you for doing this on such
short notice Everyone says youre
the best PI in town

FREDDY
Theyre right So heres what I
got on Scott Scotterson He was
already pretty thoroughly vetted
but lets just say some unknown
facts were easier to come by than
expected I had an in

Freddy hands over the folder of documents Malcolm flips
through the pages of notes and photos --

FREDDY (CONTD)
You wanted dirt well -- Itd never
hold up in court but theres
definitely something fishy
About two months ago the
Scotterson campaign was on the
verge of collapse Then all of a
sudden it wasnt Contributions
flooded in

MALCOLM
And thats odd

FREDDY
You bet Theres no evidence
linking the rebound to anything
specific The only major news
piece I could find from around the
time is this

Freddy reaches into his jacket pocket and removes a PORTABLE
DVD PLAYER He turns it on and presses PLAY

ON THE PORTABLE DVD PLAYER --

Scott Scotterson talks outside Altman Middle School Weve
seen this interview already

SCOTT (ON DVD PLAYER)

SCOTT
And

And what Malcolm just stares confused

SCOTT (CONTD)

MALCOLM
Yeah but if you gave Halcourt

SCOTT (CONTD)

CHAIRS full of bored kids

TELEVISION CAMERAS film the marching band in their opulent
uniforms On stage Scott Scotterson sits beside Ridley
Smythe Principal Mulliken and Irving Halcourt listening

RIDLEY
How delightful I didnt know you
had a marching band

PRINCIPAL DICK
We dont I hired them from a
private school

As Scotterson claps along to the familiar march Detective
Morgan addresses him and Halcourt from the back of the stage

DETECTIVE MORGAN

IRVING HALCOURT
The son-of-a-bitch blew up my
office Hell be here

DETECTIVE MORGAN
Well keep an eye out

Detective Morgan leaves Irving leans into Scotts ear
IRVING HALCOURT

his buddies goofing off His FRIEND pokes him

ISAACS FRIEND
Check out those two tall kids

ISAAC
Man they suck

Two tall kids are completely OUT OF TUNE with the rest of the

Jerry bangs a drum Malcolm blows a clarinet randomly
PUMPING his fist in the air The song comes to an END but
Malcolm and Jerry KEEP PLAYING Band members glare

rogue band members

pleasure -- nay honor -- to be

Scott stops when he notices the two band members have BROKEN
OFF from the rest of the pack and are making their way

UP ONTO THE STAGE where he realizes one is Malcolm

McCree

Malcolm pushes his way to the mic removing his ridiculous
feathered hat Jerry stands beside him warding off Scott
with his drum sticks like they were weapons

MALCOLM
Hey everybody You all know me I
used to teach here before I became
insanely rich

In the audience Daisy actually stands in shock Isaac is
just as surprised too --

MALCOLM (CONTD)

Im here today to put a stop to the
charade these men are pulling

(acknowledging his

marching band outfit)
Theyll stand up here and act like
they care about the kids when all
they really care about is an easy
buck

(beat)
And I know a thing or two about
easy bucks I used to think thats
what I wanted in life But when
you dont earn your money like
these jerkoffs it becomes
meaningless Money blinds you to
the important things Like true
friendship

He glances over at Jerry --

MALCOLM (CONTD)
Or true love

He looks at Daisy --

MALCOLM (CONTD)
We never stop to think about things
we take for granted Water
marshmallow snowballs And when
money becomes like that it can
lead to only one thing greed
Because when we dont earn
something we think nothing of
taking more and more of it Thats
what these men are doing

A BALDING REPORTER stands up
REPORTER
What the hell are you talking
about
Scott Scotterson pushes forward past Jerry onstage
SCOTT

Shut up McCree Leave now or I
will end you

MALCOLM
I dont even know what that means

Scott has no choice but to back off and signal to two police
officers who run up onstage

MALCOLM (CONTD)
Before you arrest me I want
everyone to see this I have here
an envelope containing the top-
secret internal building budget
proposed by Irving Halcourt

Malcolm points to Irving but Irving is nowhere to be seen

MALCOLM (CONTD)
This budget includes secret payoffs
to Scott Scotterson school
superintendant Ridley Smythe and
this schools own principal Dick

He hands the envelope to the balding reporter

MALCOLM (CONTD)
I give you this evidence balding
reporter because despite the
threats these men have made against
me there are more important things
than money

Scotterson pushes forward grabbing the mic Principal Dick
is signaling to the marching band to play anything

ScoTT
Hear this from me This mans
allegations are absurd and whatever
he has in that envelope is an
obvious fabrication

The band gets their act together and begins a ROUSING MARCH

MALCOLM
Scott Whatd you major in at your
Ivy League college

SCOTT

MALCOLM
Should have majored in history
‘Cause all you politicians make the
same mistakes

Malcolm and Jerry are pushed into the house by an officer
They watch Dobson step over to a low-hanging branch that
curves up toward the ceiling Dobson pulls the branch down --

And stares at the row of GROWING MONEY

He lets go of the branch and it SPRINGS back up to the
ceiling where the top CONNECTS creating a

TINY CRACK

That slowly spiderwebs along the entire roof meeting up with
the other crack formed by the trees growth into the attic

SECRETARY DOBSON (CONTD)
I want this money plucked and
examined Then torch the place

As the men go to work Malcolm looks up sees the growing
crack and taps Jerry who also notices

JERRY

Malcolm points to the roof where pieces of white spackle
start falling to the ground

Branches BURST out exploding the wall toppling the roof
Jerry and the government officials hold their breath Then --

MALCOLM APPEARS

Holding something in his hand as he LEAPS off the front porch
mere milliseconds before

THE ENTIRE HOUSE COLLAPSES

In a plume of dust and pulverized wood All thats left
behind is a pile of RUBBLE and a GIANT MONEY TREE

Unencumbered by walls the money tree has sprung up to its
true height of TWENTY-FIVE FEET It towers over everyone --

The Feds take in the EPIC SIGHT unsure what to do On the
street the old Brophys (and their dog) look on in shock

ON MALCOLM -- Helped to his feet by a relieved Jerry who
leans down and picks up the PICTURE of Malcolm and Daisy that
sat framed on Malcolms trophy shelf

Thats what Malcolm went back inside for

JERRY (CONTD)
This probably isnt the best time
to tell you I had a copy of that
picture

Malcolm isnt listening Hes noticed something odd
A BREEZE
Has arrived seemingly out of nowhere Malcolm feels it fan

his hair Watches as it RUSTLES Dobsons overcoat Then
turns to see it blowing through the branches

And it PICKS UP blowing HARDER now really giving it to the
money tree as hundred-dollar bills FLAP in the wind

THEN COME FREE

A few at first but then the entire tree sheds its LEAVES OF
CASH to the wind Dobson and his underlings can do nothing
but stare as a million bucks in cash takes FLIGHT

FLOATING UP over the neighboring houses into the setting sun
on a jetstream of wind that dies as quickly as it appeared

Malcolm turns to his destroyed home All thats left now are
a scraggly growth of branches that SHRIVEL UP and turn BLACK

The tree is dead
