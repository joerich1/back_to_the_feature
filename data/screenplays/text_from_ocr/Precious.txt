A line at a time the following quote appears over a black

screen
Every blade of grass has its Angel
that bends over it and whispers
Grow grow
The Talmud
FADE IN

1 EXT HARLEM STREET DAY

A COLD WIND blows a bright red scarf tangled high on a street
lamp

An iron waste bin is blown sideways into an intersection A
stray dog investigates it briefly urinates and then moves on

A book bag drops onto the pavement

Visible from the waist down a LARGE YOUNG WOMAN in a
disintegrating leather jacket turns the waste bin upright and
then maneuvers it onto the sidewalk

Once finished her thick hands wipe each other until they
stop abruptly

Here for the first time we see her PLUMP YOUTHFUL VACANT
AFRICAN AMERICAN FACE It is 16-YEAR-OLD PRECIOUS JONES
Something inside the bin has caught her attention
Precious gazes down upon a soiled and tattered paperback book
as the breath from her nostrils steams The title of the book
staring back up at her is unintelligible

She pushes debris aside to get to it
The book plunges deeper into the trash as if trying to flee
The sound of an ONCOMING CAR approaches

Precious pins the book against the bottom of the bin as the
sounds of the oncoming car close in

Precious finally comes up with the book Its title is still
unintelligible When she flips it over however the letters
on the cover which are facing us now make sense They read
CRYSTAL STAIR SELECTED WORKS BY LANGSTON HUGHES

1
The car sounds incredibly close

Precious looks sharply to her left

AN EERIE SKID precedes an eerier THUD Precious almost hit
falls back on to the pavement as her book skips across the
intersection and down into a drain

She lays on the sidewalk pressed against the base of the
street lamp with her eyes closed

The car reverses skids stops for a sec shifts and
SCREECHES off

The garbage bin overturned yet again rocks side to side
until settling to a stop

An ambulance eases up to the intersection

When the stoplight changes the ambulance motors past
Precious in no hurry A moment later its sirens BLARE and it
speeds off into the distance

The stray dog returns re-investigates the garbage bin and
turns to Precious He licks her face Tom Cruise walks up to
her
R2

Precious still vacant eyes finally open to see Tom
red scarf falling from the street lamp towards her
her a hand up

TOM
(flirtatious)
Whats your name girl

Precious blushes

TOM

Precious still blushing looks on the ground

and the

Precious stops and looks up at something

Before her stands a fast food restaurant with a giant sign
atop it that says KICKIN FRIED CHICKEN

Precious looks around takes a deep breath and steps inside

INT KICKIN FRIED CHICKEN - DAY 43

Precious approaches the counter with a strained
nonchalance

A MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN IN A HAIR-NET waits behind the register

Precious sets her notebook and pencil down on the nearest
table

Precious eyes wander from the fry bin all the way over to a
refrigerator towards the back

PRECIOUS

The woman chuckles and then leaves for the chicken

The digital clock on the wall reads 853

Precious whirls around to see A YOUNG MAN CIGARETTE IN HIS

MOUTH spraying the door with glass cleaner and then wiping it
from the bottom up

Precious turns back around to find her server selecting
pieces of chicken from a huge tray with large silver tongs

The clock on the wall reads 854

Precious turns to the door again to find the young man still
cleaning it

Precious turns back around to see her server returning with a
basket of chicken

PRECIOUS

The woman nods sets the chicken on the counter and heads
back towards the refrigerator in one fluid motion

The young man wipes the top of the front door and looks to be
about finished

EXT KICKIN FRIED CHICKEN - DAY

Precious bursts out of the restaurant with the bucket under
one arm and sprints off down the block

A SCREAM from inside follows

WOMAN (0S)
REGGIE GET HER

A second later Reggie the young man who cleaned the glass
dashes out after Precious

Precious looks back while sprinting and scarfing down pieces
of chicken at a remarkable rate

Across the street SHEILA Reggies pregnant girlfriend
screams at him

SHEILA

paging your tired ass all night

Reggie stops dead in his tracks Shit Busted He lights up a
cigarette about faces and prepares for her rant

SHEILA

Precious turns the corner of 126th street and onto Clayton
Powell Jr Boulevard still devouring chicken

A SKINNY DISHEVELED MAN sitting on a standpipe calls out to
her

SKINNY MAN

most just bounce off of her and fall away Consuelo bats a
few mathematical symbols off as if they were flies

Finally we land on Precious as she confidently stabs her hand
into the air to answer a question

INT CITY BUS - DAY 65

Precious rides on one of the side seats towards the back
while wearing her red scarf

The New Yorkers surrounding her are all men of various
backgrounds All wear the exact same suits and raincoats

Precious looks up to find two of the businessmen staring down
at her

We pan from them and around the bus to find all of the other
passengers studying Precious in silence as well

PRECIOUS (VO)
I likedd that museum so much I went
back by myself Peoples They
only look when my belly big They
minds all made But do they know
No They do not know that I am a
girl for flowers and thin straw
legs

If other peoples could see that the
way I do they would see that I am
a real person inside

Our long circular pan finally lands on Precious seat but
sitting there now is the pretty blond white girl from
Precious bedroom mirror wearing Precious clothes

The bus grinds to a stop

A man smiles at Precious and steps off the bus

The original Precious takes the abandoned newspaper from his
empty seat and tries to read it

gloves push antique buggy style baby carriages along the
sidewalk

Precious continues observing pensively as the ladies pass a
bearded and bedraggled elderly white man laying on the street
in tattered clothes

As Precious studies him her expression changes ever so
slightly

Enormous handwritten letters forming NOT STUPID overtake
her face as we DISSOLVE TO the PAGE upon which she wrote it

INT HOTEL THERESA CLASSROOM - DAY 66

A gush of water pours down between them as if it were a tidal
wave

INT HOTEL THERESA CORRIDOR - DAY 113

She stops in front of Cornrows desk as Cornrows converses on
the phone while picking her nails

The previously illegible sign on her desk now reads EACH ONE
TEACH ONE

CORNROWS
(on the phone noticing
Precious)
Hold on girl

Cornrows lowers the phone and waits for Precious to speak
PRECIOUS

INT CLASSROOM - DAY 114

The room is empty except for Ms Rain standing on a chair
taking streamers down

Precious appears in the doorway and studies Ms Rain a moment
as if seeing her for the first time

Ms Rain steps down from her chair looking tired

Precious enters the room

114
PRECIOUS
Miz Rain
MS RAIN

problems so

Precious looks both confused and relieved Ms Rain sits
while motioning for Precious to do the same

PRECIOUS
(sitting)
Me I never

Precious stops as Ms Rain looks away as if gathering her
thoughts

Finally

MS RAIN
Last night I had a conversation
with my mother and that never
happens cause our relationship
is complicated We dont speak
and when we do it always ends in a
fight about my filthy misguided
existence Most times I feel
terrible for days afterwards
wondering whether all the hateful
things she said are true Those
days I just feel likelike

PRECIOUS
Nuffin

MS RAIN

Yeah I didnt feel so bad this
time though

(beat)
Cause this time I thought about how
strong youve had to be and then I
decided that I had nothing to be
ashamed of and that my mother was
wrong about me my dad and 5 or 6
hundred other things You ask if
you can help me Baby you already
have

PRECIOUS

MS RAIN

MS RAIN
(standing)

Suit yourself

Ms Rain motions to the other end of a long folding table
Precious takes hold of it and they carry it across the room
together

As we watch from a distance

PRECIOUS (V0O)
Some folks got a light around them
that shine for other peoples I
think maybe some of them was in a
long tunnel before And in that
tunnel maybe the only light they
had was one that was inside of them
and then -even long after they
escaped that tunnel they still be
shining for everybody else Thas
Miz Rain to me

INT ADVANCEMENT HOUSE PRECIOUS ROOM - DAY 115

A stack of books sit on her bureau

Colorful letters and numbers hang on the wall Beneath them
hang postcards featuring Zora Neal Hurston Alice Walker
Maya Angelou and Oprah Winfrey

Abdul sleeps in his crib
Precious makes her bed

PRECIOUS (V0O)

INT ADVANCEMENT HOUSE HALLWAY - DAY 119

Precious descends a staircase to a long corridor clearly deep
in thought every step of the way

She stops momentarily to straighten her clothes

When she finally reaches a day room at the other end of the
hall she looks through its window for a moment

Mary sits inside crushing and dwarfing the couch upon which
she waits She looks frail Her wig is half combed Shes

nervous Her sweaty hands crumple her cigarette package

Precious covers her nose a moment lowers her hand readies
herself and then steps into the room

INT DAY ROOM - DAY 120

Once inside the room and for the first time Precious soft
face looks like stone

Mary looks up with a brief but quickly fading smile that is
pathetic apologetic and grim

Precious waits

The air is thick without a single word between them

Finally Mary looks down

MARY
Your daddy dead

Precious looks surprised for a moment but still composed

Mary waits for a response

PRECIOUS
Is that all

MARY
No
(beat)
Carl Carl had that AIDS virus

A previously unseen woman sitting across the room looks up
from behind a newspaper

Precious stays stone-faced until she finally GASPS as the
aftershock of the revelation hits her squarely

The man across the room collects his hat and coat and leaves

INSERT -GLIMPSES OF CARL REMOVING HIS BELT CARL THRUSTING ON
TOP OF PRECIOUS PRECIOUS FOLLOWING ABDUL TAKING EARLY STEPS

We return to the dayroom as Precious opens her eyes and lifts
them to Mary slowly

PRECIOUS

suddenly been displaced with pity 120
Precious sighs

PRECIOUS
You better go to the doctor Ma

Mary looks up delicately

MARY
You welcome back home

PRECIOUS
Im home here
(beat)
I better go see bout Abdul and do
homework

Mary doesnt move as Precious leaves
Mary sits staring at the floor at the far side of the room
INT ADVANCEMENT HOUSE PRECIOUS ROOM - DAY 121

Precious enters takes Abdul from his crib holds him closely

and sits on her bed
Moments later a TAPPING on the window draws her attention

Precious rises to find Tom Cruise hurling pebbles up at her
window in a leather jacket

A MOTORCYCLE sits a few feet away from him
He beckons her
She stares down at him with solemn eyes

Tom finally mounts his bike and vanishes into thin air while
revving its engine

Mary then crosses the frame where he was
Precious turns to Abdul and kisses him on the head
DISSOLVE TO
EXT STREET - DAY 122

Precious walks over the crest of a hill deep in thought with
her hands in her pockets The constant HUM of the city seems
lower than usual as Precious FOOTSTEPS make the most
prominent sound

122
From this distant view it appears as if she is almost
walking in place

INT HOTEL THERESA CLASSROOM - DAY 123

Ms Rain stands before the blackboard with a piece of chalk
in her hand pointing to the word unrelenting which is
written behind her

Consuelo is missing and TWO NEW GIRLS AISHA INDIAN AND FROM
GUYANA AND BUNNY VERY THIN WITH BAD TEETH have joined the
class

MS RAIN
Rita what do I mean when the

author describes her protagonists
circumstances as unrelenting

RITA

Ms Rains voice trails off as we find Precious lost in
thought

INT CLINIC - DAY 124
Precious waits in a small gray office

A FEMALE COUNSELOR WITH SYMPATHETIC EYES carrying a file sits
across from her

Her eyes say everything
The counselor places a hand on top of Preciousâ
INT HOTEL THERESA CLASSROOM - DAY 125

All the girls write in their journals except for Precious

Ms Rain watches her

MS RAIN
Precious

Precious doesnt respond

125
MS RAIN
Precious

The entire class looks up at Precious

Ms Rain waits for a response
MS RAIN
Precious bring your journal to me

Precious waits a moment and then shakes her head without
looking up

Ms Rain goes to her desk and picks up the journal without
resistance

The words Why me sit alone on the page with lines crossed
through them Ms Rain returns the journal to Precious desk
still opened to the same page

MS RAIN
Precious would you come to my
office for a moment

Precious doesnt respond
The class still watches curiously

Ms Rain steps back sits on the edge of her desk and folds
her arms

MS RAIN

Everything stops

Precious exhales

PRECIOUS

Rita rises walks to Precious and embraces her Tears well in
Precious eyes

125 125
Still trying to stay composed Precious wipes her face

Ms Rain rises walks to Precious and rubs her back as she
looks around to the other girls who are still stunned

RHONDA
Your baby okay

The class waits on pins and needles Precious doesnt answer
at first and just looks down until

PRECIOUS
Yeah He goodWont bress feed

MS RAIN
(to Precious)
One time in your journal you told
me that you had never really told

Precious eyes well up some more
She wipes her face again

PRECIOUS
What for How I feel like I am
drowning inside a giant river Miz
Rain Thas what

Precious stops herself abruptly as if being overwhelmed by a
sense of futility

MS RAIN
I think telling your story will get
you over that river Precious

Precious erupts hurling her journal sharply across the room
It bounces hard off the blackboard and stops abruptly on the
floor facedown

PRECIOUS
FUCK YOU YOU DONT KNOW NUFFIN
WHAT I BEEN THROUGH I NEVER HAD
NO BOYFRIEND MY DADDY SAY HE GONNA
MARRY ME BUT HOW HE DO THAT

Precious doesnt answer

MS RAIN
Because you love heras much as

Precious looks to her side and finds Rita smiling
reassuringly through her crooked teeth

MS RAIN

Now the rest of the world can judge

you and abandon you all it wants
but we wont let you give up and
thats the only thing that matters
Some people have less than that on
their side and still manage to keep

Precious thinks a long moment wipes her face and exhales
She doesnt move for what seems like ages

The whole class watches her until Ms Rain motions for them
to continue working Finally Precious takes hold of her pen
opens her journal sighs deeply and starts to write again

EXT PARK - DAY 126

Our young ladies and Ms Rain are seated around a picnic

The moment the door closes Precious dashes across the room
for the file cabinet behind Ms Weiss desk

Precious searches the drawers in the cabinet and rifles
through the files

132 INT ADVANCEMENT HOUSE PRECIOUS ROOM - DAY 132

Jermaine rocks Abduls crib with one hand while looking at
the file with Precious as both girls sit cross-legged on
Precious bed

Precious reads carefully

PRECIOUS
I have just finished a session
with Claireece Precious Jones an
eighteen-year-old African American
female According to her teachers
at Each One Teach One where she
attends school she is a pen- phen-

JERMAINE
phenomenal

PRECIOUS
success Having made strides so
tre-men-tremendous in the past
year she was given the mayors
award for outstanding achievement
She seems actively enengaged in
all aspects of the learning
process However her TABE test
scores are disappointingly low
Not to Miz Rain Not to Miz Rain

(continuing)

She scored 28 On her last test
So what Miz Rain-

JERMAINE

on child rearing The time and
resources it would require for this
young woman to get a GED or into
college would be considerable

Precious stops reading abruptly and hands the file to
Jermaine Jermaine looks at Precious oddly

132 132
PRECIOUS
Finish reading this I know
whats coming

Jermaine pauses and then continues reading the file as
Precious rises and paces the room

JERMAINE
Although she is in school now it
is not a job readiness program
Nonetheless Claireece is capable
of going to work In January her
son will be two years old In
keeping with the new initiative on
welfare reform I feel Claireece
would benefit from any of the
various workfare programs in
existence Despite her obvious
intellectual limitations she is
quite capable of working as a home
attendantâ

PRECIOUS
I dont want to be no motherfucking
home attendant I wanna be

JERMAINE

Hush My rapp-o-r-t with Precious
is minimal Although I am not sure
with whom she evidently has access
to counseling services provided by
Each One Teach One She has a
history of sexual abuse and is
HIV positive

PRECIOUS
She say she not put that in my
file Bitch

JERMAINE
Thats the bitchs job to get the
mofuckin goods on you

The client seems to view the
social services AFDC as taking
care of her forever

Jermaine sets the file down and looks up at Precious

PRECIOUS

this hoe dont know nuffin wurf

Jermaine speaks while slouched in her chair with her feet
crossed and arms folded

135 135

JERMAINE

work at some live-in job for some

facing

MS RAIN
You read the whole thing by

(referring to her
notebook)

212 by my count

JO ANN
Rhonda say old bitch would ring a
bell - a actual bell -when she want
Rhonda in the night

Precious stands up and looks down at Ruby sulking in her
chair She leans down gives her a big hug and tenderly
fixes Rubys hair

Precious walks off toward the stairs but stops when she
passes a mirror hanging on the wall Within the reflection
she sees her true self for the first time R141

PRECIOUS (V0O)
One day Miz Rain ask us to write
about our ideal selfI wrote that
I would be light skinned and small
wif wavy swing-job hair

She heads up the stairs toward the offices

Miz Rain read all that and then say
I am beautiful like I am I never
believe her before but somehow
today this moment -cant say why
I do Just nowThe inside I
thought was so beautiful is a black
girl too R141
Precious turns around to find that Ruby has grabbed her arm
She then reaches up and hugs Precious tightly

Through the embrace Precious finds herself facing the many
mirrors on display by the old man on the folding chair In

her reflections she sees the skinny white girl who she has
frequently imagined herself as gradually transform into the

real Precious one by one
