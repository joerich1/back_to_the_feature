THE LAST FLIGHT

Written by

John Monk Saunders

FADE IN
EXT BATTLEFIELD - NIGHT

On a FREEZE FRAME of a huge mortar on the edge of a dismal
no-mans land

surrounded by trees and overhanging branches The distant
roar of battle

RUMBLES ominously SUPERIMPOSED TITLES appear and hold for a
moment

Abruptly the image springs to life The gun FIRES
deafeningly The nearby

branches shake violently Another set of TITLES appears The
image FREEZES

again as a lone bugle plays a charge Again and again and
again the image

moves the gun DISCHARGES noisily the image FREEZES and
more sets of TITLES

appear with every FIRING

On the last discharge the trumpet fades and all hell breaks

loose

WAR MONTAGE

Nothing but FAST BRUTAL FLASH CUTS of

Cannon firing in all directions

Massive explosions on the battlefield that light up the
night

Troops marching across a bridge as a shell hits the river
below sending water
towering into the sky

An entire cavalry division galloping hard over the
battlefield blazing mortar
fire visible above them on the horizon

Brief shots of the horses their grim riders hanging on for
dear life their

muscles flexing hooves pounding the dirt Men yelling

FASTER AND FASTER MORE AND MORE CHAOTIC

Mortar fire explosions smoke

A machine gunner fires

A soldier falls

Infantrymen rifles in hand press through the haze

More machine gunning

More soldiers go down

A massive gun fires

SMASH CUT of a tank tread bearing down on the CAMERA
blacking out the screen

Infantrymen trail behind the heavy machinery firing
pistols rifles

A bridge explodes A building explodes The ground explodes

A bomb drops from an airplane

Aerial view of an exploding building

Anti-aircraft guns at work

Planes in the air

A machine gun fires skyward

Planes circle filling the air

A single bi-plane

The planes gunner SHEP LAMBERT looks down surveys the
situation breaks

into a grin

Shep nudges his pilot CARY LOCKWOOD and points Cary looks
down to see
Another plane below In it pilot BILL TALBOT waves and
salutes FRANCIS the

gunner opens his mouth smiles and nods up at them

An enemy plane arrives

The enemy pilot fires his twin machine guns

Bill and Francis plane spins away

Bill cocks a snook at the enemy plane and waves dismissively
at it much to

Francis amusement
The planes circle in the air
The enemy plane trails Shep and Cary Shep FIRES his machine
gun to no avail
as Cary watches
The enemy pilot returns fire

The two planes tango in mid-air

Shep FIRES

The enemy pilot grins and FIRES
Bullet holes riddle the side of Shep and Carys plane
Cary warns Shep theyve been hit

From the enemy planes POV Shep and Carys plane streams
black smoke

The two planes Shep and Carys plane goes into a steep
dive spinning out of

control

Cary rips off his goggles as smoke pours up from below him

Flames fill the cockpit as Carys gloved hands desperately
try to keep hold of

the red hot controls

The plane streaming smoke spins wildly downward

Shep surrounded with smoke looks skyward and salutes with
mock gallantry

Above Bill and Francis watch Bill returns the salute with
a smile and waves
Francis though doesnt look happy
Shep twists in his seat and looks around
Carys hands grasp the controls in the flaming cockpit

SHEP (0oSs)
Level off Cary Level off

Despite the flames Cary pulls back on the control stick
From the planes POV The landscape rushes by

The plane now level crashes into the ground and comes to
an abrupt stop

Smoke Flames

Cary jumps out of the cockpit and rushes back to Shep who is
struggling to
clamber out

CARY
Shep Shep are you all right

SHEP
Cant make it Cary Cant make it

CARY
Here give me your arm Ill get
you out of here Hang on there
Shep Get a hold - Just hold tight
old fella

Cary pulls Shep out and hauls him away from the burning
wreckage where the two
of them collapse to the ground half-conscious

Flames consume the plane

A TEMPERATURE CHART

for Lieutenant Shep Lambert a patient at US Army AEF
Base Hospital 145

Sheps temperature readings for October 11th to October 26th
are indicated by

a line on a graph near a level marked CRITICAL The distant
sound of battle

continues to RUMBLE

ANOTHER CHART
swings into view This one is for Lieutenant Cary Lockwood
whose readings for

October 27th to November 2nd are also below the CRITICAL
mark The line

continues and improves considerably by November 11th when
the final reading is

marked NORMAL

DISSOLVE TO

INT HOSPITAL - DAY

The battle sounds are now joined by a loudly TICKING clock
With no sign of

energy or emotion Shep and Cary sit together on a hospital
cot in full

uniform Shep wears dark eyeglasses Cary has a coat draped
over his hands He

glances off We follow his gaze PANNING past other patients
in the hospital

to a wall clock and calendar It is November 11th and the
time is almost

eleven A M The battles RUMBLE drones on

SHEP AND CARY
stare up at the clock Behind his dark glasses Sheps left
eye twitches

THE CLOCK

slowly DISSOLVES to one last BRIEF BATTLE MONTAGE soldiers
yelling and

running guns firing noisily a plane crashing explosions
The final image is

of a plane parked on the ground its engine dying its
propeller slowing toa
stop as we DISSOLVE BACK TO the clock face The center of
the clock is lined

up exactly with the center of the propeller -- the slowing
propeller blades
are replaced by the clocks hands -- as if to symbolically

suggest that the
war has ended but time goes on The NOISE of battle fades
and only the TICKING
of the clock remains DISSOLVE TO the calendar November
11th 1918 --

Armistice Day

SHEP AND CARY
sit motionless side-by-side on the cot Shep has a hand over
his left eye

CARY
Well the old guerre is finie
SHEP
Thats right

CARY
What are ya gonna do now Shep

SHEP
Get tight

CARY
(turns to him)
And then what

Shep lets go of his eye and looks at Cary as if the answer
were obvious

SHEP
Stay tight

Cary grins wryly
CUT TO

INT DOCTORS OFFICE - NOT LONG AFTER
A nurse opens a door for Shep and Cary who enter Shep wears

his dark glasses
Cary carries his coat to hide his hands They pause as the

doors they have
passed through close behind them

Their distinguished-looking doctor a medical officer with a
white gown over
his uniform sits at his desk studying their papers

DOCTOR
Lieutenants Lambert and Lockwood
(crises joins them)
You two leaving us eh In a way
Im sorry to release you two I have
no choice in the matter

Shep removes his glasses and presses his hand to his eye
SHEP
What am I going to do Major about
my-- oh this rotten business

The doctor examines Sheps eye more closely

DOCTOR
Mm Spasmodic twitching of the
muscles under the eye eh
Lieutenant

SHEP
Mm hm

DOCTOR
What the French call a tic T-I-C
tic Little bothersome isnt it

Shep puts his glasses back on

SHEP
Yes sir

DOCTOR
Im afraid timell have to take care
of that Time and normal living

Sheps lips tighten skeptically
DOCTOR
You two are returning to the United
States I presume

Shep glances at Cary

CARY
Ah we havent decided

DOCTOR
Id take the first boat home Well

here you go

The doctor gives Shep his release form and shakes his hand

then turns to

shake Carys Cary merely looks down darkly and raises a

bandaged hand at him

DOCTOR
Oh I forgot your burnt hands

The doctor folds up the release and stuffs it in Carys

breast pocket

DOCTOR
Neither of you is fully hospitalized
Id undertake a systematic course of
finger exercises -- to uh stretch
them and loosen them up In time
youll regain their full use
CARY
Thank you sir

The doctor gives Cary a pat on the shoulder

DOCTOR
Bye Lieutenant

Cary manages a smile and salutes Shep moves to the door
saluting the doctor

DOCTOR
Bye Lieutenant Good luck

Shep opens the door and he and Cary head out After the door
closes the

doctor rubs his head thoughtfully He talks apparently to
an offscreen aide

DOCTOR
Well there they go Out to face
life
(shakes his head)
And their whole training was in
preparation for death

He moves off as we
CUT TO

EXT HOSPITAL - MOMENTS LATER

Shep and Cary exit the building but pause outside the
doorway Theyve seen

something coming toward them and glance at one another
before clearing out of

its path They watch glumly as a small group of wounded
soldiers enter through

some metal gates walk slowly past Shep and Cary without
acknowledgment and

head into the hospital

Cut TO

EXT DOCTORS OFFICE - PERHAPS SIMULTANEOUS

The office window opens The doctor -- no longer in white
but wearing his
uniform -- and his aide take a break standing in the window

frame fora
little fresh air The doctor smokes a cigarette as they
discuss Shep and Cary

AIDE
Why cant they go on with flying
You know the air mails or
something

DOCTOR
Im afraid theyre unfit for further
service in that direction

The aide looks at him quizzically

DOCTOR
They fell you know -- six thousand
meters
(shakes his head sadly)
Like dropping a fine Swiss watch on
the pavement Shattered both of them
Their nervous systems are deranged
disorganized brittle

AIDE
Spent bullets

DOCTOR

Spent bullets Thats it

(nods)

Theyre like projectiles shaped
for war and hurled at the enemy
(gestures with cigarette)
Theyve described a beautiful
high-arching trajectory And now
theyve fallen back to earth
Spent Cooled off Useless

We slowly PULL BACK from the two men

AIDE

Oh well if they take care of
themselves theyll pull through
all right

DOCTOR
Even if they do take care of
themselves what good are they
What can you expect of them
(shakes his head)
I hate to think what may become
of them

We have pulled back far enough and now we

Cut TO
EXT HOSPITAL - NOT LONG AFTER

Two uniformed men with familiar faces -- exuberant pilot
Bill and reserved
gunner Francis -- arrive at the bottom of the stairs in

front of the hospital

Bill with his arm in a sling and Francis using a cane
start up the stairs

and wave

BILL
(Texas accent)
Hello Cary

FRANCIS
Hi Cary

At the top of the stairs Shep and Cary wave back pleased
to see them

CARY
Hello Bill Hiya Francis

SHEP
Hello Bill Francis

Unexpectedly Shep and Cary hurry down the stairs past them

CARY
(friendly)
Well I see you got yours

BILL
(pleasantly)
Yup We crashed

Bill and Francis watch surprised as Shep and Cary hurry
off

BILL
(calls down puzzled)
Hey Where you going

Shep and Cary already seated in the back of a waiting
automobile grin like
kids

CARY
Paris

BILL (os)
Paris
From the stairs Francis smokes a cigarette and looks down
at Shep and Cary

uncertainly But Bill takes the news in stride -- he smiles
and waves his hat
at them
BILL

See you in Paris

FRANCIS
(waves his cigarette)
Yeah

Smiling Shep and Cary wave back as their car drives off
DISSOLVE TO

EXT THE EIFFEL TOWER - NIGHT
A superimposed text reads

PARIS -- 1919
Traffic noise taxi horns squeaking
DISSOLVE TO

EXT PARIS SIDEWALK - NIGHT

Strolling down the sidewalk four abreast as if they own the
town come our

heroes -- Bill Shep Francis and Cary -- in smart hats and
dinner clothes

Outwardly they seem to have recovered from their wounds
But

Shep still wears his dark glasses and we occasionally
glimpse his eye
twitching

Carys bandages are gone but he has not regained full use of
his hands His

personality is dark and dry more subdued than Sheps and
he comes across as

the most levelheaded rational member of the group -- its
unacknowledged

leader

Francis seems to have suffered the greatest toll
psychologically A

narcoleptic strangely detached and unemotional much of the
time always on

the verge of dozing off his speech slurs even when he isnt

drunk

Only the athlete of the group Bill -- a burly Texan whose
full name is

William Talbot -- is in outstanding physical shape But he

is reckless

restless and temperamental covering up unnamed
insecurities with bravado and

forced exuberance

CARY
How bout a cocktail

SHEP
Not a bad idea at that

As a group they turn and head into a nearby building
BRIEF DISSOLVE TO

A GLOWING SIGN

made of light bulbs outside the building It spells out
CLARIDGES -- a

popular Parisian drinking establishment for Anglo-Americans

DISSOLVE TO

INT CLARIDGES - NIGHT

Numerous shelves holding numerous bottles of liquor
Employees in white

jackets hurriedly rush in and pull down a few bottles

DISSOLVE TO

INT CLARIDGES BAR - LENGTHY PANNING SHOT

The place is packed with well-dressed men and women The bar
is crowded with

men (and men only for no women are allowed to sit at
Claridges bar) smoking

drinking conversing At the end of the PAN we discover our
heroes entering

greeted by an employee who takes their hats

ANOTHER VIEW - NEAR THE BAR

An attractive young woman with a wide vacant stare stands
against a wall

opposite the bar holding a champagne glass in her hands Her
name is NIKKI and

she seems to be in a world all to herself
Our four handsome heroes file past her intent on finding a
table Only Cary

pays any attention to Nikki After they have all passed her
he pauses to turn

and stare Shes extremely nearsighted and doesnt notice
him He looks at the

glass in her hand puzzled He starts off but then pauses

After a second uncertain look he moves off to join his
friends who stand

together and peer around the crowded room unable to find a
place to sit Cary

keeps looking at Nikki He glances at the others and they
follow his gaze

NIKKI
still wearing a blank expression clutches the glass in two
hands

THE GLASS

in her hands Between her fingers we glimpse its contents -
- a complete set

of mens false teeth

We PULL BACK to discover that Cary has approached her Hes
standing right

next to her and is staring at the glass She finally notices
him

CARY
I beg your pardon But if Im not
too inquisitive would you mind
telling me what IS that youre

drinking

NIKKI
Teeth

CARY
Teeth

After another look Cary turns to his friends

CARY
Hey its teeth

BILL (os)
Teeth

Shep Bill and Francis hurry over like children and crowd
around to stare in
amazement at the teeth Nikki is unimpressed by all the

attention
SHEP
Teeth
NIKKI
Thats right
BILL
(enthusiastic)
Yup Its a full set -- upper and
lower
CARY
(to Nikki)

Its a nice expression

SHEP
Hey how come youre with those
teeth

NIKKI

I was just standing here And a nice
gentleman came along and begged my
pardon and asked would I mind
holding his teeth for a minute

CARY
Well what did he want you to hold
his teeth for

NIKKI
Said he wanted to biff somebody

BILL
(excited)
Biff somebody Which way did he go

NIKKI
Just around to the right

BILL
Come on men Were liable to see a
fight

As quickly as they arrived Shep Bill and Francis depart
Cary starts after

them but stops to politely address Nikki who has gone back
into her trance

CARY
Would you like to come along

NIKKI
(as if it were obvious)
Oh no I have to stay here and mind
the mans teeth

They glance down at the teeth

CARY
Oh of course

Cary hurries off as Nikkis empty eyes rise to the ceiling

FLASH CUT - A MANS FACE
as it takes a combination one-two punch from a pair of
fists

FLASH CUT - THE MANS BODY
dropping unconscious to the floor

OUR FOUR HEROES

enter a hallway just in time to see two Claridges employees
reach down and

haul away the unconscious body Our heroes have missed the
fight but Shep and

Bill are delighted anyway Bill brushes his hands (one of
his favorite

gestures) with satisfaction as if he had thrown the punches
himself

BILL
Well THATS all fixed

Bill straightens his bow-tie Already the group seeks a new
distraction

CARY
Lets go back

They head back to the bar

THE BAR

Nikki no longer standing against the wall sits on a bar
stool with her back

to the countertop smoking a cigarette and holding an empty
champagne glass

Our heroes enter and glancing at the wall fail to see her
After a moment of

searching Cary spots her at the bar

CARY
Oh there she is
All four crowd around her pleased to be in her company

BILL
Well we missed it

NIKKI
Did something happen

BILL
Well they carried a guy out
(sees her empty glass)
Say Whats become of the teeth

NIKKI
Oh the man came and got his teeth

CARY
Well what did he say

NIKKI
He said thank you for holding his
teeth

CARY

What did he look like

NIKKI
I think he fell in an airplane in
the war -- and got his teeth knocked
out

CARY
Well why do you think he was in the
war

NIKKI

Oh he had a kind of little striped
ribbon in his buttonhole

CARY
What makes you think he was a flyer

NIKKI
His eyes

CARY
His eyes
(dry to the others)
You can tell a flyer better by his
ears
The men chuckle

SHEP
Well what do you say we have a
drink

BILL
Fine

FRANCIS

Seats have opened up at the bar so they grab stools next to
Nikki Shep greets
the bartender

SHEP

CARY
Nikki

For the first time this evening Shep takes off his dark
glasses

SHEP
Can you imagine that fellas Her
name is Nikki

CARY
(considers the
situation)
Her name is Nikki She holds mens
teeth She sits at the bar and she
drinks champagne

BILL
(significantly)
Boys shes gonna be a lot of
trouble

Drinks are served A moment of silence as they imbibe
Nikkis hand shakes as

she lifts her glass spilling some champagne She laughs
embarrassed

NIKKI
Oh my my

Shep who has been watching her closely also laughs

SHEP
Poor sweet She cant even hold her
glass

Nikki notices Cary unsteadily using both his hands to hold
his Martini

NIKKI
(casually)
Oh well HE cant either Besides
he has to use two hands

Nikki chuckles A dark look crosses Carys face as he looks
at her and puts

down his drink Seeing this Bill and Francis exchange
worried glances Cary
abruptly rises and leaves the bar Mystified Nikki looks
quizzically at Shep
who is suddenly grim and annoyed

SHEP
Course he cant hold his glass His
hands are burned

NIKKI
Burned

SHEP
You have no right to spill YOUR
drinks He cant help himself

NIKKI
Burned How burned

SHEP
He brought a plane down on fire

NIKKI
An airplane In the war

Shep demonstrates with his hands as he explains

SHEP
He held the stick But his hands
began to slip Then he held it
inside his arms He was trying to
bring his rear gunner down alive

NIKKI
Did he bring him down safe

SHEP
Well

Shep takes a swallow of his Martini sets down the glass

SHEP
Brought him down

NIKKI
Oh so thats why--

SHEP
Yes Thats why he cant holda
glass

NIKKI

Oh Im so ashamed
SHEP
Now Carys had a pretty thin time
His nerves are tricky You should
never call attention to his hands

AT A TABLE

Cary sits with a fresh drink and is trying awkwardly to pick
it up when a

handsome but humorless American journalist -- the
unspeakable FRINK -- enters

and greets him casually

FRINK
Hi Cary

CARY
(unhappily)
Oh hello Frink

Cary immediately turns his attention to a menu Rebuffed
Frink wanders over

to the bar and sees the other men He has a friendly pat on
the back for

Francis and Bill

FRINK
Hello Francis Bill

Frink pauses to stare at Nikkis back astonished to finda
woman sitting at
the bar Then he turns to Shep amused

FRINK
Shep Drunk again

SHEP
Say dont you know any OTHER
opening remarks Its about all
weve heard from you for a year

FRINK
(signals the bartender)
Hi Jean

Frink snaps his fingers at Jean and grabs a seat next to
Shep Jean asks for
Frinks order in French

FRINK
Un sidecar
JEAN
Sidecar

Jean moves off Frink regards the others

FRINK
Say why dont you fellows go home
and go to work

SHEP

FRINK

BILL

machines Drive a milk wagon Mend

FRINK

BILL

FRANCIS

Francis holds his fingers to indicate a very small kite
Bill chuckles

FRINK
Well there must be something you
can do

SHEP

Weve got to tend to our drinking
We dont get much opportunity

FRINK
Lots of things going on outside
Sun shining trees growing people
walking around

BILL
Say Is that STILL going on

SHEP
(laughs)
Sounds pretty pre-war to me
During all this Nikki has been in her own little world
Frink leans over and
whispers to Shep

FRINK
Hey Dont I rate an introduction
Whos your swell friend

SHEP
Oh her Just an old hussy we found
scattered around

Around her neck on a slender chain Nikki carries a small
lorgnette It opens

with a spring and has small rectangular lenses She uses it
frequently

peering at unfamiliar objects in her helpless nearsighted
way On Sheps

remark she whips it out to stare at him mildly offended
He raises his drink

to his lips and turns to her speaking out of the side of
his mouth

SHEP
(off Frink)
Pay no attention Sometimes he goes
away

Nikki looks away glumly as Shep grins at her She turns and
sees something
She raises her lorgnette for a better look at

CARY
who sits at his table staring into space holding his
unread menu in his lap

NIKKI
is pleased to see Cary

NIKKI
Oh He didnt go

She rises to join him

CARY
startled rises and stares at Nikki as she approaches

NIKKI
Oh Im so sorry Your hands
She tries to take his hands but he pulls them away in horror
and stuffs them
in his pockets

NIKKI
Oh your poor hands Your poor poor
hands

Wildly uncomfortable Cary glances around like a cornered
animal and finally

stalks away without a word hands still stuffed in his
pockets Stunned Nikki

watches him exit the building She realizes shes done
something terribly

wrong and moves to follow him

NIKKI
Oh

But Shep intercepts her Upset she whimpers

SHEP

(more in disbelief

than anger)
If you arent the WORST First you
insult his hands and make him mad
Then you cry over them and make him
self-conscious Come on back here
Come on

He clasps her hand and leads her to

THE BAR

Francis and Bill watch disturbed as Shep guides a crying
Nikki onto a stool

beside them Shep sits next to her as she continues to sob
She pulls out a

compact to fix her tear-stained face

SHEP
Well thats torn it Hell never
come back now

NIKKI
Then well have to find him

SHEP
What for

NIKKI
To explain how sorry I am
SHEP
(amused at her
distress)
We-ell You dont have to get so
emotional about it

NIKKI
Whos getting emotional

SHEP
You are Youre coming all apart
(hands her a glass)
Here Take a drink of this Make
you laugh and play

Nikki takes a sip then busies herself with putting away her
compact
Meanwhile Bill leans in

BILL
(to Shep)
Say whats she crying about

SHEP
Shes crying on account of they
didnt wash her strawberries this
morning

BILL
(to Nikki)
Didnt they wash your strawberries
this morning Well there aint a
whole hell of a lot that we can do
about that now

NIKKI
(agrees sadly)
No

ANOTHER VIEW
Frink watches suspiciously as Shep pays the tab rises and
whispers to Nikki

SHEP
Lets go

Nikki obediently hops off her stool and Shep leads her away
from the bar

toward the exit Bill and Frink are distressed to see her
go Bill calls after

Shep
BILL
Hey Wherere you goin

SHEP
Oh out
BILL
(rises)
Out where
SHEP (os)

Out to get a drink

Bill gestures grandly toward the bar with its many shelves
of liquor bottles

BILL
Dont you suppose you could arrange
that here

SHEP
Nope We gotta go somewheres else

BILL
(without missing a beat)
Okay Come on Francis We got to go
somewheres else to get a drink

Francis and Bill head out the door After a moment Frink
follows behind

DISSOLVE TO

EXT AVENUE DES CHAMPS ELYSEES - LATER THAT NIGHT

A taxi cab -- filled with Bill Francis Shep Nikki and
Frink -- pulls up to

a restaurant As it stops Bill rises and points to someone
at a sidewalk

table

BILL

The others look

SHEP

BILL

The group cheers spills out of the taxi and heads for
THE SIDEWALK TABLE
where Cary sits reading a newspaper

SHEP (os)

removes his hat The
others crowd around him

BILL
Say what are you tryin to do

CARY
(genuinely polite)
Hello Wont you sit down

BILL

They all take seats around the little table During this
Frink brings a chair
for Nikki who grabs a seat of her own When he tries to use

it to sit next to
her Bill commandeers it for himself

BILL
(with a wave to Frink)

NIKKI

Oh I know Im not very good-

CARY

NIKKI
But when I was a little girl my
mother always said I had the nicest
hair-ribbon

Shep laughs derisively The others give him a look and he

shuts up The drinks
arrive All the men save Cary snatch up their glasses

Bill removes the
toothpicked olive and swallows his Martini whole He watches

Nikki rubbing her
champagnes drinking straw between her hands as if she were

a Boy Scout trying
to start a fire

BILL
Then theres her drinking

NIKKI
Whats the matter with my drinking

BILL
Youre a sissy drinker

NIKKI
Well maybe I can improve

Meanwhile Cary attempts -- with some success -- to drink
his Martini with one
unsteady hand Bill inspects Nikkis mouth

BILL
Then theres her teeth Why one of
em is turned sideways

NIKKI
(points)
You mean this one

BILL
Thats it

CARY
Why dont you have it turned around

NIKKI
I dont have it turned around on
account of its a kind of help

CARY
Well in what respect does it kind
of help

NIKKI

Well you see when anyone kisses me
too hard it splits my lip And you
could tell when anyone kissed me too
hard on account of my lip would
bleed So now I dont let anyone
kiss me -- hard

The men are amused Nikki sips her champagne

CARY
Well well let that pass

Bill chuckles Shep abruptly rises and walks off presumably
to the rest room

NIKKI
Wheres he gone

CARY
Shep went off to sharpen his skates

BILL
Now about your nose

NIKKI
What about my nose

BILL
It isnt straight It kind of turns
up at the end

NIKKI
Well when I was a little girl I
got bumped by a swing

CARY
Howd you happen to get bumped

NIKKI
I just walked through the gate I
was only seven

CARY
Oh poor dear Didnt you see it
NIKKI
I cant see very far

CARY
Did it hurt

NIKKI
It made me dizzy all day

CARY
Well I guess we cant hold that
against her

BILL
We all make mistakes

CARY
Thats right Michelangelo painted
Adam with a navel

Bill and Nikki laugh at this Suddenly Nikki grows
thoughtful

NIKKI
All the same hed look funny the
other way -- even in a painting

They all consider this for a moment as a fresh round of
drinks arrives Frink
abruptly rises and walks off presumably to the rest room

NIKKI
Wheres he gone

BILL
He went off to shave a horse

CARY
Have you got a husband or anything

NIKKI
No husband

CARY
A mother

NIKKI

Mother yes But we havent met in
quite a long time

CARY
Why not in a long time
An odd CHIMING sound distracts them

FRANCIS

the narcoleptic arms folded asleep in his chair

with a frown

pulls a pocket watch from inside his jacket

looks at it The

chiming ends and he rises without a word and exits

NIKKI
Well on account of my mothers name
was Beulah Now you cant have a
mother named Beulah So I changed it
to Jane And thats how it all began

AT THE TABLE

Nikki watches Francis

before she can ask

Shep looks down the street

SHEP

They all look to see

A HORSE-DRAWN CAB
rolling down the street in their direction

AT THE TABLE
Everyone watches as Bill rises and suddenly bolts in the
direction of the cab

BILL
Look out horse

THE HORSE-DRAWN CAB

rolling along as Bill runs in and tackles the horse locking
his big arms

around the animals front legs to trip up the poor creature

ON THE SIDEWALK
Cary horrified stands and yells

CARY
Hey Bill Bill Come back here

Cary runs off toward Bill leaving a thrilled Shep anda
worried Francis with

a distressed Nikki They all stare in concerned amazement as
a crowd of

pedestrians stops to watch the excitement

NIKKI
(distraught)
Oh Bill

AT THE HORSE-DRAWN CAB
Cary rushes up to the startled cab driver who is pulling
hard on the reins

CARY
Hey Whats the idea -- runnin

Cary forces a wad of francs into the drivers hand The
cabman protests in

French but takes the cash

WIDER VIEW
of the fallen horse as the driver descends from the cab
Standing up now Bill

tries to haul the horse to its feet while Cary tries to
placate the driver

CARY
Never mind Look where youre going
in the future now You just watch out

ANOTHER VIEW

Bill grabs the horse by its bridle and tries to pull it up
The horse sorely

annoyed gets up on its own and shakes its head violently to
drive Bill away

Bill hangs on and tries to calm the horse Cary tries to
pull Bill away as

Frink Francis and the driver gather around Bill is more
interested in

petting the horse which understandably shies away from him

CARY
(admonishes Bill)
Now listen come on out here you

BILL

CARY
(to Bill)

Now listen you ought to be ashamed

Satisfied with the outcome of all this Bill heads back for
the sidewalk

CARY
(to the driver)
You all right now brother

The driver nods but is more concerned with reining in his
skittish horse

CARY
All right Now you just keep your
horse see You got your money
The cabbie salutes Cary but pays more attention to his
horse

BACK AT THE SIDEWALK TABLE

The waiter sets out a fresh round of drinks as the group
returns Bill happily

dusts off the sleeve of his dinner jacket Cary beside him

leads him to his

Nikki abruptly rises

SHEP

NIKKI

NIKKI
(a grave announcement)
To take a Chinese singing lesson

olive in the air and cheers

FRANCIS
Hooray

The men rise and all but Frink cheer her lustily as she
departs

MEN
Hooray Hooray Hooray Hooray
NIKKI

walks proudly into the restaurant as the men cheer A
smiling maitre d

directs her to the ladies room

BACK AT THE TABLE

Frink watches Nikki disappear from view and after a glance
at the others

rises and follows her Shep Bill and Cary remain at the
table laughing and

drinking Bill turns to Cary with a smile

BILL
Hey What kind of a girl do you
think Nikki is

Cary glances in Nikkis direction and tells Bill
confidentially

CARY
I think shes the kind that sits
down on phonograph records

Bill thinks about this and nods

INSIDE THE RESTAURANT

As Nikki returns from her Chinese singing lesson Frink puts
his arm against a

wall blocking her way

FRINK
Say Nikki lets ditch these
drunks and go off somewhere by
ourselves These crazy fools are
liable to do anything

NIKKI
(hopeful)

Nikki pushes his arm away and heads for the table Frink

watches her go

a

dark look on his face

BACK AT THE SIDEWALK TABLE
The men rise briefly as Nikki rejoins them and sits

FRANCIS
Nikki Are you the kind of girl that
sits down on phonograph records

Nikki lowers her eyes

NIKKI

INT BAL TABARIN BALL ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

A festive Parisian night spot Dance MUSIC plays while a
floor show lit by

moving spotlights unfurls in the huge darkened ballroom
which is ringed with

crowded tables A handsome male dancer in tuxedo and top
hat whirls

exuberantly around the floor surrounded by beautiful chorus
girls

Somewhere above all this Nikki lit by spotlight flashes
sits on the edge of

a ringside balcony observing the show with eager interest
through her

lorgnette

The show continues after a few twirls the dancer links
arms with the girls

to form a line and do some precision high-kicking The music
continues but the

dance apparently ends and the lights come up Impressed
Nikki is breathless

NIKKI
My my Isnt this nice

Nearby the men sit at a roped-off table for six on a low
balcony Cary and

Francis sit glumly on one side of the table as Bill tries to
tell a story to

the others (Frink a nameless young woman nicknamed Kiss-
Me-Quick who
appears in this scene only Shep and Nikki)

BILL

Cary gives her a look then rises and peers with one eye
into the open bottle
of champagne on the table between him and Nikki He gestures
at the bottle as

he sits back down

CARY

Say I wonder if theres anything

intoxicating in that

Everybody cracks up -- except Nikki

The other men seated at the table understand instantly

stare darkly at Frink

SHEP

The group enters the spacious empty lobby laughing loudly
Someone says

Wheeee Others say Ssshhh They cross to the front
desk

AT THE FRONT DESK

The clerk is fast asleep his head down on the desk Nikki
is about to wake
him when Bill bounds forward

BILL
(quietly to Nikki)
Sh Let him sleep Whats your
number

NIKKI
(whispers)
Eighty-eight

Bill waves the others on and they exit toward the elevators

Once theyve gone Bill the athlete vaults the front desk
and lands -- with

a little noise -- on the other side without waking the
clerk

He cautiously checks the clerk to make sure the sleeping man
hasnt awakened
then fetches Nikkis key from its cubbyhole
Bill leaps up on top of the desk landing on his rear end
swinging his legs

around -- nearly kicking the clerk in the process -- then
silently slides off

the desk to the floor

Watching the sleeping clerk warily Bill tiptoes away

At the last possible moment Bill purposefully WHACKS the
signal bell with his

hand making it RING noisily The clerk awakens with a start
and grabs a

nearby telephone just as Bill disappears from view

IN THE HOTEL ELEVATOR

Amused the group piles into the ascenseur Last one in is
Bill who shuts

the door and the metal safety gate behind him

Bill brakes the car too quickly -- it slams to a halt and
everyone loses their

footing nearly falling down Part of the light fixture
above them breaks

loose and crashes down on Frinks head much to everyones
amusement -- they

laugh as Frink clutches his head annoyed
FRINK
Thats right laugh

CARY

Bill reaches for the controls but Shep grabs the tail of
Bills jacket and
pulls him away

fashion Shep walks an

imaginary tightrope wobbling spectacularly Cary bringing
up the rear shuts

the elevator door and escorts Nikki

FRANCIS

Francis drops into a handy chair and lights a cigarette but
Bill immediately
hauls him up

BILL
Come on come on

Bill whistling and pretending to ice skate leads the group
down the hall

Francis tries to enter a room but Frink pulls him out of the
doorway Bill

backtracks to help Frink escort Francis This allows Cary
and Nikki to take

the lead Nikki indicates the correct doorway to Cary

The gramophone comes to life and MUSIC plays from a record
Nikki passes into

the bedroom and switches on a light

FRANCIS
Got all the comforts of home

Frink tries to follow Nikki into the bedroom but Bill
pointedly intercepts

him Disappointed Frink looks past him into Nikkis bedroom
and Bill follows

his gaze to see

PERFUME BOTTLES
on Nikkis glass-topped dressing table -- dozens of them

BILL
Hey Look at all the bottles

Bill enters and inspects the table closely
NIKKIS BEDROOM
as the other four men respond to Bills enthusiastic summons
and enter

During this Francis has casually inspected a curtained
walk-in closet near

the table He pulls the curtain to reveal a rack of
carefully hung dresses and

a floor covered with dozens of shoes organized in impeccably
straight lines

FRANCIS
Say I never saw so many shoes

The others gather to peer into the closet Frink loses
interest immediately

but whistles at the sight of Nikkis sheer nightgown draped
across her bed He
moves to it eagerly

Nikki sits on the edge of the bed removing her shoes as
Frink picks up her

silk bedclothes and examines them with a grin Bill
pointedly takes the gown

out of Frinks hand Tight-lipped Frink stares at him
Suddenly Bill points

to a small wind-up clock on Nikkis night table

BILL
Look

Bill drops the garment on the bed and moves to the night
table

BILL
She never winds her clock
(picks up the clock)
It says eleven and Ive never been
anywheres at eleven

Nikki removes her earrings as Frink walks off and Cary takes
a seat at the
foot of the bed

CARY
(dry to Bill)
What time are you anywhere

Bill shakes the clock and puts it to his ear listening

BILL

(to Cary ignoring Nikki)
Two oclock Its always two oclock
in my life Hey listen Besides
never having any matches and always
spilling her drinks she never winds
her clock Think Ill go in the
bathroom and see if she leaves the
cap off her tooth paste

Bill heads for the bathroom but then stops and turns back to

Bill disappears into the bathroom leaving Nikki and Cary
sitting on the bed
Nikki peers at Cary through her lorgnette

his little finger flicks wax off his finger daintily buffs
the ear with the

towel and finally blows sharply into the ear causing her
to wince She

(looks at her legs)
On account of my legs Oh
(turns to Cary
heartfelt)
I think that would be sweet

Cary manages a slight grin As he does theres a knock at
the door Everyone

hollers Entrez Shep runs to the door and opens it

SHEP
Oh boy Here come the drinks

The others cheer happily Two hotel employees enter carrying
trays loaded with

already poured drinks Shep hands a glass to Nikki

SHEP
Here Nikki drink this

CARY
Make you laugh and play

NIKKI
Thats what I want to do laugh and
play

Shep hands Bill a glass

Francis sits groggily on the sofa a drink in each hand He
polishes off one

and then the other He leans over and sets one empty glass
on the floor but

holds on to the other as he puts his head to the nearby
pillow and dozes off

Cary Bill and Shep crowd around Nikki who is still seated -
- all have drinks

The tray-carrying hotel employees have apparently exited
Bill proposes a
toast

BILL
Heres to Nikkis dainty legs As
smooth and hairless as an egg

SHEP
Wheee

CARY
Hurray

NIKKI
Ray

They drink Another knock at the door They all yell
Entrez The door opens

to reveal Frink -- whose face falls when he sees the other
men with Nikki The

others are not happy to see him either

CARY
Well Here comes that licentious
old man Who invited him

Cary hands his glass to Bill and moves to meet Frink as he
enters

FRINK
(sneering)
Still drinking

CARY
(shakes his head
mockingly)
How can you tell

Cary watches Frink approach Nikki

FRINK
Morning Nikki

After a pause Nikki looks up at him uncertainly as if she
doesnt recognize
him Then she peers at him through her lorgnette

NIKKI
Oh its you
(after a pause
reluctantly polite)
Wont you sit down
FRINK
Thank you

Frink moves off to find a chair Shep sets down his drink
and follows him
Frink starts to move a chair but Shep stops him

SHEP
Say I dont think Nikki likes you

FRINK
Oh no

SHEP
No What do you wanna hang around
for

FRINK

Well what do YOU hang around for

SHEP
Me Why I came to bring Nikki some
posies Ill bet you didnt bring

FRINK

During the above dialogue Bill nudges Cary mischievously
and they glance down

at the tray in front of them They exchange knowing nods
pick up some drinks

bring them over and offer one to Frink

BILL
Have a drink

FRINK
No thanks

SHEP

FRINK
I havent got the shakes

CARY
Lets see Hold out your hands

Bill and Shep watch with interest as Frink holds out his
hands palms up
CARY
No turn them over

Frink turns them over palms down Cary looks at Frinks
steady hands
impressed

CARY
Say thats pretty good

Cary looks down at the drink in his own hand

CARY
Lets see if you can hold this

Cary sets the glass on top of Frinks downturned hand Frink
balances the full
glass with ease

CARY
Say thats great

Cary places a second full glass on Frinks other hand Frink
balances both
glasses with ease Cary expresses keen admiration

CARY
Steady as a rock

Frink looks at the others a little smugly Cary slowly
backs away and walks

off as do the others Frinks face falls as he realizes he
has been left

standing in the middle of the room with two drinks balanced
on top of his

hands and no way to safely remove them

Cary Shep and Bill return to Nikki and crowd around her
CARY
Well I guess thatll keep his hands
out of mischief for a while

Frink abandoned reluctantly pleads with the others

FRINK
Hey Take these off

But the others simply ignore him

CARY
Now lets see Where were we before
we were so rudely interrupted

BILL
We were talkin about Nikkis legs

CARY
Thats right We were talkin about

Nikkis legs And havin a fine time
too

The Asian maid who has been working on Nikkis feet abruptly
rises

WOMAN
Finis

The men cheer

Yay and Nikki smiles at the woman as she
exits with her

tools The men crowd closer to peer down at Nikkis legs

SHEP
Lets inspect the job

But Nikki quickly covers her toes with a hand

NIKKI

Oh my poor toes Dont look too
close

Nikki wraps her robe around her legs and stuffs them under
body Since shes

no longer using her footstool Cary commandeers it and sits
on it

CARY

Well whats the matter with your
toes

Nikki grows extremely somber and begins to tell a story --
very slowly Her

eyes stare into space and her voice conveys terrible
sadness

NIKKI
Well when I was a little girl

A worried look crosses Carys face

NIKKI
my mother bought me a new pair
of shoes And they were WAY too

short
Shep and Bill listen soberly

NIKKI
And I had to walk all the way to
Sunday school and back Down the
road And it was hot and dusty
BILL

(hand to his face)
Oh take her away Shes breakin

my heart
(sobs)
NIKKI
And when I got home my toes
were spoiled
CARY

(on the verge of tears)
Oh dear oh dear

SHEP

Thats such a sad story Lets all
have a drink quick

Their eyes pop The men jump up eagerly and run off Nikki

thoroughly

nonplussed by this takes a sip of her drink Shep

Bill crowd around

a tray and start imbibing

Meanwhile
lose the two glasses

Cary and

Frink looks around unsuccessfully for a way to

that are still balanced on his hands

For the first time in this scene

drink tray and

and Cary

Nikki walks off

to stand around

NIKKI

And now would you all excuse me
On account of Im gonna put ona
dress

CARY

Well why not

Nikki is on her feet She

puts a friendly hand on the shoulders of Shep

exiting into her bedroom The men continue
the tray drinking In the background Francis sleeps on the
sofa

Over by the fireplace a frustrated Frink still balancing
the two drinks

casts a dirty look at the others He angrily hurls the
glasses into the

fireplace smashing them loudly Francis startled awake by
the noise jumps

off the sofa The others stare at him

SHEP
My my Whats HE getting so excited
about

Frink furious rubs his hands with a handkerchief and
stuffs it in his
pocket

FRINK
You guys think youre so darn smart

Shep Bill and Cary laugh at this Cary consults his pocket
watch

CARY
Well cheerio fellas Im off

Bill waves goodbye Cary eats a last olive tosses the
toothpick and heads for
the front door

CARY
See ya later

Cary exits as Nikkis voice drifts in from
THE OPEN BEDROOM DOORWAY

NIKKI (os)
What are the plans for the day

Shep drink in hand enters and leans on the wall outside
the door

SHEP
Well on account of its raining and
everything we thought wed go over

Nikki appears in the doorway dressed to go out

NIKKI
Do you think Cary might object

SHEP
Well I have an idea hed like to be
alone

NIKKI
Why alone

SHEP

Well Cary likes to be alone Hes
as brittle as a breadstick One
silly crack from you and he might
break up in sections

NIKKI
(thinks about this)
Well then I dont think he should
be left alone
(beat)
Tell me whats Cary doing in Paris

SHEP
What are we all doing in Paris

NIKKI
I know But why doesnt he go home

SHEP
Well hes not ready to go home
What could he do if he went home
Have people cry over his hands

NIKKI
Well it seems - a pity to go on
like this Hes such a sweet soul

SHEP
One of the best

NIKKI
Isnt he just sort of wasting
himself

SHEP

On the contrary Hes trying awfully
hard to get hold of himself

Lost in thought Nikki moves off and a worried Shep follows
her to

THE FRONT DOOR

Shep stops Nikki from leaving Shes a little downcast as he
admonishes her

SHEP
Now listen If you tag along for
heavens sake be careful what you
say Dont start getting sorry for
him and dont cry over him
(with a chuckle)

And above all dont make any
unfortunate remarks hear

NIKKI
(earnest)
Oh I wont Why who ever heard of
such a thing

Nikki opens the front door and exits into

THE HALLWAY

where Cary -- carrying coat hat and cane -- emerges froma
suite across the

hall from Nikkis and heads for the elevator He stops when
he hears Nikki

calling to him She runs to join him

NIKKI
Cary Cary Im coming with you
Without waiting for a reply she starts for the elevator
then stops to look
down at her shoes

NIKKI
Oooh
(to Cary)
Ooh wait for Nikki

She leaves him and runs back to

THE FRONT DOOR

of her suite where Shep still stands He watches with
surprise as Nikki runs

in

NIKKI
(calls back to Cary)
Wait for Nikki

Puzzled Shep follows Nikki who rushes to

HER BEDROOM CLOSET

Nikki draws the curtain to reveal her enormous collection of
dresses and

shoes Shep drink in hand wanders in slowly and leans
against the doorjamb

as he watches Nikki pull off one pair of shoes and put ona
seemingly

identical pair of red ones

SHEP
What are you changing your shoes
for

NIKKI

On account of I can walk faster in
red shoes

Shep watches her hop and scurry off
FADE OUT

EXT AVENUE CASIMIR-PERIER - LATER THAT DAY

Passerbys carry umbrellas on this rainy day A taxi cab
pulls up to a sidewalk

café -- LA REGENCE according to the awning that covers the
little iron

tables Cary emerges from the cab and pays off the driver as
Nikki hurries
under the awning Cary joins her and after a word to the
driver (Restez
ici) looks at the rain

CARY
(to Nikki)
Perhaps wed better stay here a
while till it clears up

NIKKI
Could we sit down here do you
suppose

CARY

I think so Would you like something
to drink

They move toward the café As Cary hangs up his hat a
waiter arrives

NIKKI
What should I drink now do you

Cary orders the drinks as Nikki moves to sit at a table

CARY
(to the waiter)
Deux picon citrons

The waiter acknowledges this and heads inside calling out

the order to his

bartender Cary joins Nikki at the table and sits down She
removes her gloves

and fixes her face while he takes out a cigarette and lights
it under the

following

NIKKI
Picon citrons

CARY

CARY
Well Shep has that tic under his
eye you know Takes a lot of drinks

of treatment Drinkings the only
corrective so far as hes concerned
Hes found out the tic doesnt work
when hes tight So he stays tight

The waiter arrives with the drinks As he spritzes seltzer

water into their

glasses Cary leans over to light a cigarette for Nikki

they drink

CARY

NIKKI

CARY

(lost in thought)
Ohhh thorn-apple trees in blossom
The smell of burning leaves in the
fall The sound of horses hoofs on
the road

(looks at Nikki)
Did you ever dig up an Indian mound
or uncover a nest of baby field
mice Or explore old trunks in an
attic Listen to the moaning of the
telephone wires in the winter wind
See a gypsy caravan

NIKKI
(enthralled)
So THATS why you were happy On
account of apple blossoms and field
mice and telephone wires and gypsy
caravans and old trunks and things

CARY
Thats right

Nikki exhales drinks looks at Cary and shakes her head

NIKKI
But arent you going back Not ever

CARY
Would you like another picon citron

Nikki finishes the last of her drink

NIKKI
No Im ready now

Cary leaves some money Nikki gathers her things They rise

They approach the large tomb which is fenced off by a low
iron gate Cary

removes his hat Nikki peers at the double sepulchre through
her lorgnette

NIKKI
Tell me about the worlds most
famous lovers

CARY
Well Abélard was a scholastic
philosopher--

NIKKI

Whatever that is

CARY

Whatever that is He gained a
footing in a certain household as
tutor to a maiden called Héloise
And employed his unlimited
opportunities for the purpose of--
Well betrayal Not however
unmixed with real love He carried
her off to Brittany

NIKKI
Tell me more

CARY
Well her uncle was furious He
blamed Abélard for the whole thing
He conceived a terrible revenge

NIKKI
(uneasy)

Im afraid for Abélard

CARY
He broke into Abélards apartment
one night and perpetrated upon him
the most brutal punishment

NIKKI
Oh dear

CARY

The lovers were forced to live
their lives apart But when they
died they were buried here side by
side

(peers down at

the ground)
Theres a story that little heart-
shaped stones are supposed to grow
around the tomb

NIKKI
Heart-shaped stones

CARY
And lovers come and find them and
exchange them with each other
(looks at Nikki)
And so long as you keep the stone
from the tomb of Héloise and Abélard
no harm can come to your true love

NIKKI
How perfectly beautiful

CARY
Isnt that a quaint legend

They crouch at the iron bars of the gate surrounding the
tomb and take off
their gloves under the following

NIKKI
Do you think I might find a heart-
shaped stone You help me Cary

CARY
All right Nikki Only we have to
leave soon
(looks off)
They close up the place

NIKKI
Just as soon as we find our stones
They reach through the gate to poke at the rocks and gravel
surrounding the
tomb After a moment Nikki rises and walks off excitedly

with a stone in her
hand

NIKKI
I found one Wheres yours

Cary too finds a stone and rises to join her

NIKKI AND CARYS HANDS
as the couple sits near the tomb They show each other the

stones in their
upturned hands Nikki takes the heart-shaped stone from her

palm and places it
in Carys stiff weathered hand Then she transfers his

stone to her hand

NIKKI
And now you take mine And Ill
take yours

They close their hands over the stones as we PULL BACK to a
WIDER VIEW of
Nikki and Cary smiling at one another

NIKKI
Isnt that the way the story goes

CARY
Thats right Nikki

NIKKI
And now no harm can come to our
true love

CARY
(amused)

He starts to rise but she puts a hand on his arm

NIKKI

To pay my respects to an old comrade

NIKKI

He stares at her astonished as she rambles on

NIKKI

Oh dont look so troubled Cary

his shoulder)
On account of youre so nice Youre

Nikki turns to put the bracelet in her purse Thoroughly
unnerved by this
emotional outburst Cary looks around
CARY
Its getting dark

Cary rises deeply uncomfortable Nikki tries to make
amends

NIKKI

Anyway we found a name for my
turtles

Cary turns and looks at her amazed

CARY

THE TURTLES
are plucked from the tub and placed in

A BASKET

secures a wire mesh covering over the basket and carries it
out of the

bathroom handing it grandly to Francis
BILL
Here you are Francis Youre the
custodian of the turtles Now dont

water from her wet

hand
NIKKI

necktie loosened and his coat off -- appears in the doorway
coming from the

trains corridor

BILL
Hi men Look what I found

With a grand gesture Bill presents an elderly British
gentleman who follows

him into the little room greeted with a cheer of Hooray
from the men who

sit around similarly coatless (save Frink) smoking and
drinking

Various bottles stand on a central table The old gentleman
is greeted warmly
but its never clear whether he is an old friend or a total

stranger
SHEP

The men laugh A whistle BLOWS The conductor appears
briefly in the doorway

to announce in French that the mademoiselles compartment is

Nikki wakes rises and clutching her pillow heads for the
doorway

NIKKI

The old gentleman looks rather astonished at this casual
exchange

FRANCIS
Take off your shoes

SHEP

BILL

NIKKI
No I can manage quite well by
myself Good night everybody

The men say Good night Frink who has been watching
Nikki with a predatory
eye is the most polite

FRINK
Good night Nikki

Nikki turns and disappears down the corridor The old
gentleman mops his brow
with a handkerchief and stuffs it in his collar

CARY
Can you imagine that ungrateful old
trollop She wouldnt let them help
her undress

GENTLEMAN
Cant understand it at all

CARY

architecture

GENTLEMAN

During the next exchange Frink seated by the door grins
at Bill and Shep

exits into the

corridor without anyone noticing his departure

Frink away from her

FRANCIS

Nikki grabs a wrap from the turned-down bed and covers
herself as Frink pushes
Francis hard into a nearby wall knocking him to the floor

FRINK

Frink turns back to a defiant Nikki as Cary enters and sees
a dazed Francis

slumped against the wall clutching his head Cary grabs
Frinks shoulder and

spins him around

As Frink slumps down to floor and leans against the bed
half-conscious

Francis rises and watches the proceedings with a hand on his
head

Cary fist still tightly clenched stands over the dazed
Frink as Bill

brightens considerably and wipes his hands with delight
BILL

Bill and Shep carry Frink in and dump him on the seat
opposite Francis Bill

walks off wiping his hands happily The others are grim
furious at Frink for

his actions Shep watches a disgusted Francis soak his hand
and sprinkle Frink

as if he were one of Nikkis turtles Frink snaps out of his
daze

CARY
Frink dont you know better than

FRINK

As Bill drinks the old mans shadow wobbles forward Bill
hears the sound of
liquid SPATTERING He stops drinking and looks puzzled

A stream of liquid pours down onto Bills right foot
soaking his sock and shoe

Bill turns to find the drunken old man leaning at an
unsteady angle the

alcohol spilling steadily out of a glass in the mans hand
and onto Bills

foot

BILL

drunken old man

brushes some lint off Bills jacket as Bill shakes his pant

banderilleros enters the ring

Led by their guide Pedro the group takes seats in the
front row back of the

trenches They have to sit close down so Nikki can see
things The drunken old

man from the bar tags along behind Bill like a puppy dog and
tries to sit next

to him but Pedro pointedly directs him to a seat in the
second row

When Bill rises to cheer the parade the drunken old man
also rises and taps

him affectionately on the shoulder Bill turns and greets
him pleasantly

shaking his hand

BILL
Well My old pal

The old man tips his hat to Bill and sits Bill shakes his
pant leg and gives
the old man a wry look before also sitting

IN THE RING

The parade ends A matador throws his montera (his black
woolen hat) into the

crowd

IN THE FRONT ROW

Cary catches the hat much to the groups delight -- they
shout Hooray

Immediately a cape is hurled at Bill who drapes it over the
railing before

them Cary offers the hat to Nikki

PEDRO
He works close to the bull

Bill scoffs and waves dismissively Cary leans in with a

query
CARY
Is it true the bull is blind when he
charges
PEDRO
He sees only the cape -- perhaps
IN THE RING
Bull-fighter and bull continue their duel Finally the bull
gets the

advantage and others must rush in to distract the bull

You know I should have BEEN a

PEDRO
You should have started at twelve
years of old

BILL
I bet I could start right now

CARY

the bull which

runs wild out of control

IN THE FRONT ROW

Frink nudges Francis awake and points out the carnage in the
ring Francis

glances at the spectacle briefly and then sleepily applauds
Frink gives hima
look and nudges him to stop clapping Francis simply goes
back to sleep

WILD BULL MONTAGE
The toreros try to control the bull but it refuses to
cooperate
The crowd watches intently Bill takes off his own hat and
picks up the
matadors cap that Cary had caught

fq

Toreros scramble and run for their lives The bull chases
them down runs

across the ring forcing them to jump the barrera the
protective wooden

barrier that circles the inside of the arena

Bill now wearing the cap cant resist leaning over and
mocking a group of

toreros who huddle in the callejon the safe side of the
barrier just below

him

BILL
Nice work Tony Nice work Joe

The toreros look up at Bill in surprise One of them
responds in Portuguese
with a gesture toward the ring as if to ask If its so
easy why dont you

try it The other toreros laugh

Bill stares into the ring a savage look in his eyes He
puts a leg up on the

railing

He jumps down into the ring

CARYS VOICE
Hey

Cary rises stunned

CARY
Bill Come back here

But it is too late Bills coat is already off and he waves
it like a cape as
he stalks after the bull

The bull turns and sees him

Bill moves toward it waving his coat and grinning like a
madman

Shep is frozen Beside him Nikki screams and turns away
The bull begins to charge

Cary climbs over the railing

The bull charges

TRACK FAST TOWARD Bill who holds the coat before him -- big
eyes big grin

The bull is on him The bull roars

Bills face snaps backward in a blur his coat follows

The bull gores him through his coat His face twists in
pain

CUT WIDE as the bull knocks Bills body around the ring like
a rag doll He
hits the ground hard Screams from the crowd

Four toreros rush in

They surround and distract the bull Bill lies motionless
Cary runs across the ring

More toreros and others rush in surrounding the bull
finally leading away

smiles amused

with himself

BILL
Cary I slipped

CARY
Too bad You were doing fine

BILL
Wasnt I though Heh Its a cinch
Bull-fighting Just as easy--

Bill breaks off and raises his head to look at the doctor
off screen

BILL
Hey Doc Be careful What are you
doing
To distract him Cary pulls out a handkerchief and mops
Bills brow which
glistens with sweat

BILL
You know why I slipped Cary

CARY
No Bill Why

BILL
On account of that beer in my shoe

Bill breaks off and raises himself up again

BILL
Hey Doc

Cary gently eases Bills head back down

BILL
Cary that bull certainly was
hostile

Pedro escorts Shep (in his dark eyeglasses again) and Nikki
into the room The

doctor in surgical gear puts on gloves and looks annoyed
by the intrusion

SHEP
You hurt Bill

NIKKI
You all right Bill

BILL
Sure Im all right I was a big
success

The doctor has some sharp words for Pedro who acknowledges
this and approaches

the others
PEDRO
He wants that we should go right

Pedro exits
BILL

Im sure glad that I - I wore my new
blue shorts Ill be a big success

at Bill before retreating to the door He turns to look
back at Bill who

journalists

PEDRO

EXT CARNIVAL - NIGHT

The amusement park at Port Mayer Crowds carnival NOISES a
carousel with

At a nearby refreshment stand we find the group minus
Bill Everyone is

unusually silent and wearing dinner clothes Francis holds a
mug upside-down

Frink leers at Nikki who ignores him while she Shep and
Cary down their

drinks They hear

GUNSHOTS
They look over to see

A little shooting gallery where customers rent genuine guns
to shoot various
colorful targets and win prizes

CARY
Sounds like old times
SHEP
Lets go and shoot

CARY
Not a bad idea
(to Nikki)
What say Annie Oakley Like to
fire off a gun at something

NIKKI
No objection

SHEP
(to their bartender)
Well be right back Hold
everything

The group starts over to

THE SHOOTING GALLERY

where an assortment of rifles and pistols are neatly laid
out Cary and Shep

escort Nikki to the arsenal while Frink and Francis tag
along behind An

attendant joins them to collect their money and ready their
weapons

SHEP
First one to miss pays for the drinks

CARY
Whatll we shoot at

NIKKI
Shoot one of those pussycats and see
what happens

SHEP
All right Look out pussycat

Shep FIRES and misses the moving cats that float across the
base of the range

on an endless chain and disappear But he hits a tinier
target a clay pipe

behind them

Sheps eyes pop with surprise

SHEP
Well thats what I was aiming at
a clay pipe
(stares in amazement)
shoulder

Whole things been misrepresented
to me

Cary laughs at him

NIKKI
Cary lets see you shoot something

Cary takes careful aim

CARY
Look out ball

He FIRES and hits a ball balanced atop a stream of water

NIKKI
Whatd YOU aim at

CARY
Well lets see you shoot something

Nikki awkwardly raises her little target rifle to her
The end of the
barrel describes uncertain circles in the air A multiple

exposure point-of-

view shot of the targets reveals that Nikki is a little too

tipsy to be

handling a gun Cary moves to help her

CARY
Oh no no no Nikki

NIKKI
How do you hold it still

CARY
Listen Nikki on your right
shoulder Now put your hand out
there and hold up-- No dont cover
up the site No no no thats
right Now just hold it evenly--

Rapid GUNSHOTS Cary looks up in surprise He and Shep turn

to watch in

amazement as Francis cuts loose with an automatic rifle

shattering a whole

row of pipes with split-second firing

The others cheer as Francis lowers the weapon and stares

moodily at an

astonished and apparently very drunk Frink Cary takes

this moment to
encourage Nikki

CARY
You can do better than that Show
him up

She again tries unsuccessfully to hold the rifle steady
Amused Frink picks
up a pistol and imitates her

FRINK
What are you waving at Nikki

Cary sees Frink pointing his gun at Nikki and moves to
intervene grabbing
Frinks wrist with both hands

CARY

(angry)
Look out Why you fool Dont you
know better than that

Shep and Francis move to shield Nikki

FRINK
Whats the idea

CARY
Pointing a loaded gun at Nikki

FRINK
Take your hands off me

CARY
Put down that gun

FRINK
Let go of my wrist

Frink violently pulls free of Carys grasp and as he does
the gun goes off

with a BANG Francis hurries Nikki to safety in the opposite
direction Shep

backs away clutching his side -- for a moment it looks
very much as if hes

been hit Cary pursues and confronts Frink

CARY
Put down that gun

Frink backs up to a nearby lamp post and wielding the
pistol points it at
Cary His face is tense savage

FRINK
Listen you keep your hands off me
Ive had enough from you You try
any more of your rough stuff on
me--

A nervous crowd of passersby pauses to watch the showdown

CARY
Oh so thats how it is I thought
we taught you how to behave

Frink drunk and frustrated starts to lose it completely

FRINK
You taught ME how to behave Listen
youd better behave now or youll
get hurt

CARY
(calmly)
I dont think so Ill give you
three to put down that gun Itll be
just too bad if you dont

FRINK
Too bad for who

Frink cocks the hammer

CARY

Cary moves slowly toward Frink

FRINK
Keep away from me Ill shoot I
tell ya Ill shoot

CARY
Two

Frink and Cary are less than a yard apart

FRINK
Ill shoot Ill shoot

GUNSHOTS Cary flinches Frink drops the pistol his face
twisted in pain He
starts to fall
Nearby Francis coolly FIRES his rifle pumping seven
bullets into Frink

Members of the crowd SCREAM in terror Instinctively Shep
(still clutching

his side) and Nikki each put a restraining hand on Francis
arm Francis

lowers the rifle staring in horror and amazement at what
hes just done

CARYS VOICE
Francis

Cary rushes over and pulls the rifle out of Francis hands

CARY
Francis

Francis snaps out of his trance as Cary hurriedly returns
the rifle to the

gallery Shep and Nikki watch stunned as Francis
immediately moves to Cary

and shakes his hand

FRANCIS
Goodbye Cary

Francis turns to Shep and Nikki for equally heartfelt
handshakes an odd look
on his face

FRANCIS
Shep Nikki

They realize he is saying a final goodbye The crowd presses
in as Francis
glances back at Frink before turning and hurrying off

As a huge crowd rushes in the direction of the shooting
gallery Francis

threads his way through it in the opposite direction and
with only the

briefest glance backward rounds a corner to disappear
behind a building

Cary stares at Frinks body as the gathering crowd streams
into view then

quickly starts to lead a shaken Shep and Nikki away from the
shooting gallery

CARY
Weve got to get out of here Come
on Shep Come on

They slip through the thick fringe of excited people fast
gathering in front

of the shooting gallery and hurry off in the same direction
as Francis who is

now

BEHIND THE CARNIVAL BUILDINGS

on a dark deserted street Distant crowd NOISE and carnival
MUSIC drifts in

Under the light of a street lamp on the edge of the
carnival Francis strolls

casually into view and swings a leg over a slackly hung
boundary rope pausing

to glance backward He sees

Cary Shep and Nikki as they round the corner and pause
a little
breathless to lean against a wall Shep his fist still at
his side slumps
weakly as Cary and Nikki stare at

Francis who briefly makes eye contact and then without
a word turns
steps over the rope and pulling his jacket collar up around
his neck walks
off instantly swallowed up by the darkness

Cary and Nikki stare after him astonished

CARY
Thats the last of Francis Im
afraid Well never see him again

NIKKI
Did you notice his eyes Thats the
first time I ever saw Francis really
happy Whatll happen to him do you
suppose

CARY
Dont worry about Francis Hell
take care of himself Lets get out
of here Lets walk

Shep leans weakly against the wall his eyes glassy

SHEP
No Dont want to walk Lets take
a cab
Cary quickly moves to a signal a cab parked nearby Nikki
rests a sympathetic
hand on Shep

DISSOLVE TO

THE BACK SEAT OF THE TAXI CAB - MOMENTS LATER

As the cab jolts down an uneven street and drives slowly
through the crowded

carnival the MUSIC continues Cary and Shep sit on either
side of Nikki Cary

is as edgy as Shep is subdued

Did you see the way Francis poured
lead into that fellow

SHEP
Fast work

CARY
Fast Chain lightning

SHEP
Nice shooting

CARY
Those slugs went right past my ear
If Idve moved an inch I wouldve
caught one of them myself

SHEP
Sudden Death all right

Nikki takes out a cigarette

CARY
Whats the matter with you Shep
Ive never known you so quiet
before

SHEP
Thats right I am kind of quiet

NIKKI
(holds her unlit
cigarette)
Not smoking

SHEP
No
NIKKI
Your lighter working

SHEP
Good ol Nikki -- never has any
matches

NIKKI
No

As Shep puts his hand in his inside jacket pocket to pull
out his cigarette
lighter a strange look crosses his face

SHEP
Sure you want a light

NIKKI
Thats what I want a light

Shep pulls out the lighter and flicks it on -- revealing
bloodstains on his
white shirt Nikki stares down at the blood in horror

NIKKI
Shep Shep

Nikki jumps up and moves away from Shep into a seat
opposite

CARY
What is it

NIKKI
Sheps hurt

Cary turns to Shep who slumps back weakly against his seat
with a strange

look of release and satisfaction on his face

SHEP
Its a forgery

Cary examines Shep reaching in to feel his bloody wound

NIKKI
Do something for him Cary Oh
Shepard

CARY

Hes been shot
NIKKI
What can we do Cary What can we

do

CARY
Shep why didnt you say you were
hurt

SHEP

Good old Cary Sweet Nikki You may
not believe it but this is the best
thing that ever happened to me

CARY
Oh Shep Shep dont say that
Youll be all right Well get you
to a hospital

Shep puts a hand on Carys arm as the taxi continues to jolt
along down the
street

SHEP
No no Cary Dont rush me anywheres
Lets sit here for a while The--
Hurts the jolting

Urgently Cary reaches over and bangs on the glass between
themselves and the
cab driver

CARY
Stop Stop

In front of the carnivals slowly revolving carousel the
cab rolls to a stop

The carousel MUSIC drifts in Shep hardly moves -- head
back blank eyes

staring voice dreamy and weak Cary puts his face close to
Sheps listening

intently
SHEP

Thats better You know Cary I feel
- just like were falling -- long
time ago Do you remember Spinning

spinning spinning Only you
brought me down safe Oh Cary Good
old Cary

(sighs)

Best flyer in the service
Nikki seated opposite is distraught

NIKKI
Oh Shepard Shepard darling

CARY
(reassuring)
Were gonna make a safe landing
again Shep

SHEP
Not this time Cary Ol Sheps
gonna crash
(beat)
Say but were spinning fast Level
off Cary level off

Sheps head slumps down His face presses against Carys
shoulder

NIKKIS VOICE
Oh Shepard Shepard darling

Cary cant look at him Eyes wide Cary slowly presses his
cheek to Sheps

CARY
Shep - Shep - Shep

Cary looks as if he is on the verge of tears And yet he
cannot bring himself
to cry

FADE OUT
FADE IN

EXT TRAIN WHEELS
ROAR down a railroad track

DISSOLVE TO

INT TRAIN COMPARTMENT - NIGHT

Nikki cranks her portable phonograph turns it on and puts
the needle to the

record -- Tosellis Serenade that strange sad
composition that haunted

Europe at the close of the Great War

As the bittersweet romantic music plays she listens for a
moment Then she
turns and sidles over to sit next to Cary who is seated by
the window

scribbling something on a piece of paper beside a small
lamp

NIKKI
What are you writing Cary

CARY
A letter A letter to Sheps mother

NIKKI
Mind if I read it

CARY
Certainly not

Nikki reads the letter silently A long pause

NIKKI
Why Cary Cary thats the most
beautiful letter Ive ever read

Nikki turns away and begins to cry quietly

NIKKI
Please forgive me for crying Cary
I cant help it You dont mind if I
cry just a minute do you

CARY
No Nikki

Cary puts aside the letter

NIKKI
Cant you cry Cary

CARY
No

NIKKI
But you have cried sometime in your
life havent you

CARY
Long long time ago Before the war

NIKKI
And you cant cry now Not even for
Shep
CARY
Shep Lambert spent his life in the
war He had nothing more to give He
had died once And he was ready to
die again

NIKKI
This time he was played out with
music That was the way he wanted it

CARY
And Bill Talbot was a big success in
the hospital in his new blue shorts
Maybe hell tackle the angel Gabriel
and - be a big success again

NIKKI
And Francis

CARY
Maybe Francis will forget to wind
his chiming watch one day and go on
sleeping Till the end It doesnt
matter now Without them nothing
matters We only had each other
Comradeship was all we had left
And now thats gone too

NIKKI
And you Cary You Youre alone
now

CARY

Thats right Im alone now

NIKKI
I dont want you to be alone Cary
Let me stay with you Let me be with
you

He takes her hand looks at her affectionately

CARY
Why Nikki Youre sweet

He kisses her hand A strange apprehensive look crosses her
face as she turns

her hand over in his hands and opens it -- to reveal a
heart-shaped stone

Cary looks at her in surprise

CARY
Why Nikki you kept it You didnt
forget

She lowers her eyes for a moment then looks at him

NIKKI
No harm can come to our true love

CARY

(amused skeptical)
No harm can come to our true love

(genuinely)
Oh Nikki youve become very dear
to me I want to help you Cant I
do something for you too What do
you want What can I get you

NIKKI

Well Ive always wanted a pair of
Spanish earrings

He gives her an uncomprehending look but then breaks into a
smile as she

buries her head lovingly in his shoulder He kisses her hand
again

cut TO

THE TRAIN
in a dark bleak landscape as it chugs away down the track

DISSOLVE TO

THE END
