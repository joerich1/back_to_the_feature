EXT STREET MORNING

THE CAMERA moves along a typical suburban street in an
AERIAL SHOT showing bright and well kept home after home
Finally we focus on two homes One house is orthadox
suburban littered with pink flamingos and lawn jockeys
The other could use a coat of paint and some gardening
repairs We dwell on the better of the two homes for a
moment

INT BEDROOM MORNING

BIG RUSS JOHNSON slowly cracks his eyes open as a steady
clang-clang-clanging shatters the silence of the bedroom
he shares with his wife MAE

Russ is a gruff self-made man the president of his own
construction company (Olympian Construction--We Build Them
Bigger and Better) Russ admires hard work and doesnt
trust people who read newspapers that dont contain a
comics page Like many Americans hes impressed by ©
appearances If its big it has to be great

Mae is a quiet but strong woman She winds up doing most

of the child-rearing in the home and at times treats Russ
like her biggest most problematic child

Russ staggers to the bedroom window and gazes down into his
backyard

EXT JOHNSON BACKYARD MORNING

There his ten-year-old identical twin sons RON and DON
are busy pitching a tent to spend the weekend in The twins
are gung-ho Cub Scouts with great imaginations To then
the neatly-kept grassy yard with its ceramic animals is a
jungle

Although identical in appearance Ron and Don are
opposites Ron has a mischievous streak as deep as the
Grand Canyon while Don is the more responsible of the two
INT BEDROOM MORNING

Big Russ gapes at the twins checking his watch

BIG RUSS
What are you two doing

EXT BACKYARD MORNING

Don freezes Ron continues banging merrily away

THE TEENY-WEENIES 2

RON
Pitching a tent dad

BIG RUSS (resigned)
Dont you know Im sleeping

RON
But youre talking to us dad You
look wide awake Doesnt he Don

DON (sotto exasperated)
Ron

Ron smiles innocently at his father Big Russ slams the
window down

INT BEDROOM MORNING
Big Russ bites his lip and walks back towards the bed

BIG RUSS
Everybody in this house is a
comedian

MAE
Except you dear

BIG RUSS
Darn right

The clanging continues Big Russ winces

MAE
Theyre only children

BIG RUSS
Hitler was a child once

He crawls back under the covers

MAE (smiling sweetly)
As long as youre up why dont
you make some coffee

Big Russ stares at her perplexed She smiles brightly at
him Hes beaten He sighs and gets out of bed grabbing
his favorite battered Olympian Construction cap (it has a
picture of Hercules on it with a big 1) down over his
head with a sharp tug

BIG RUSS
Good idea

INT HALLWAY MORNING

Big Russ stumbles into the hall still sleepy He

THE TEENY-WEENIES 3

“) encounters his oldest son LITTLE RUSS in the hall Good
looking and clean-cut Little Russ is a strong but
slightly diminutive fifteen year old His dead is
constantly pushing him to overexcell “Little Russ doesnt
mind Hes a jock but not a typical one Hes quiet and in
fact more than a tad self-conscious about his short
stature

BIG RUSS
Why dont you pump some iron son Get
in shape for football practice

LITTLE RUSS
Uh dad

Big Russ doesnt give his son a chance to speak He heads
downstairs towards the kitchen Little Russ shrugs and
trots down the stairs and outside the house

EXT JOHNSON BACKYARD MORNING

In the yard while the twins continue to pitch their tent
Little Russ clad in a sweatsuit begins to pump iron

Ron soon grows bored with the tent He sits down on the
ground with a thud

7 DON

Whats the matter

RON

This is sissy stuff
DON

What is
RON

Camping in the yard I want to camp out
in the real jungle With wild animals
Cannibals Grizzly bears

DON
Grizzly bears dont live in the jungle

RON
They do in my jungle And theyd
eat weiners like you for breakfast

INT SZALINSKI KITCHEN MORNING

This entire backyard tableau (Russ prowess in particular)
c is being watched from the house nextdoor by AMY SZALINSKI
as she toils at the kitchen stove

Fifteen-year-old Amy is a pretty no-nonsense type Shes
tall wears glasses and feels very out of things because of

THE TEENY-WEENIES 4

) her height To help hide her stature she often walks

stoop-shouldered and tends to be self-effacing

At 9 AM the Szalinski place is already a madhouse Amy
is trying very hard to prepare breakfast for herself her
dad and her kid brother six-year-old NICHOLAS She is
having a hard time of it While scrambling the eggs whisps
of her straw-colored hair keep falling in her eyes

Little brother NICK ignores her plight reading a science-
fiction novel at the kitchen table One of the brightest
tykes imaginable Nick is far ahead of his peers in terms

of schoolwork which pleases his parents but annoys Amy
who winds up doing most of the drudge work Nick is
terrified of the real world He is small and thin and has
asthma When faced with a problem he more often than not
plays sick

AMY
Hows the toast coming

NICK
Fine

He glances into the frying pan at what is supposed to be
scrambled eggs

NICK
Mom never made them like that

AMY
Moms not here

NICK (after a beat)
When do you think shes coming back

AMY
I dont know Maybe never

Nick stares at the eggs as Amy begins to pour them out onto
a platter The eggs resemble something yellow that has just
been hit by a car traveling at a very high speed He sniffs
at the goop
NICK
I hope she comes back soon ©

Amy glances at the toast Smoke is billowing from the

toaster
AMY
a Nick The toast is smoking Do you know
oot what that means
LO NICK

Its hot

OO

THE TEENY-WEENIES 5

AMY
Straight-A student but you cant
make toast

NICK
I want to be a scientist like dad
not a cook

AMY
Where is dad

NICK
Upstairs

AMY (sighing)
As usual

INT ATTIC MORNING

In the attic WAYNE SZALINSKI is putting the finishing
touches on an electromagnetic pulse invention he has
constructed A good-natured easy-going guy with a PhD in
physics Wayne holds a low-level job for an aerospace
company and spends his weekends on his own work A bit of a
scatterbrain in terms to day-to-day living for Wayne
physics is easywearing matched socks is not

As Wayne putters the familys feisty little Yorkshire
terrier QUARK watches mystified

WAYNE
This is it Quark A red-letter day

He flicks the switch The machine begins to hum The dog
backs towards the door

WAYNE
A common laser device you say

The dogs ears flop up forming the canine version of a
question mark

WAYNE
Wrong Quark Its an amazing electromag-
netic pulse device If this honey works
correctly its computer scanners will hone
in on a solid inanimate object analyze
and isolate its molecular structure and
then reduce the space between its
electrons You know what that means dont
you

Quark stares dumbfounded at his master
THE TEENY-WEENIES 6

WAYNE
It will actually shrink the object A boon
to the space program It will decrease the
size and weight of payloads sent into space

Quark yawns Wayne walks over to a couch standing next to a
wall and removes an apple from a paper bag Quark barks and
springs to life wagging his tail furiously Could this be
snacktime

WAYNE
Nifty huh

He walks over to a large steel plate the size of a wall
and places the apple on a pedestal

WAYNE
The only problem is I havent gotten
this thing to work yet But Im close
Quark Very very close

Quark finally seeing that the apple isnt his walks back
towards the door dejected

Wayne puts on protective goggles and activates the double-
beamed machine THE TWO BEAMS SPARKLE AND COME TO LIFE
BUZZING HARMLESSLY IN THE AIR WAYNE ADJUSTS THE CONTROLS
THE TWO BEAMS INTERSECT AND FORM ONE POWERFUL SOLID SHAFT
OF LIGHT THE BEAM HITS THE APPLE ENGULFING IT A SHADOW
OF SPARKLING LIGHT SHIMMERS ALONG THE OUTSIDE OF THE APPLE
THE APPLE VIBRATES Quark cowers Wayne licks his lips in
anticipation waiting for the apple to shrink

WAYNE
Come on Shrink Shrink

THERES A SUDDEN BLAST THE WALLS QUARK AND WAYNE ARE
COVERED WITH A SMALL SHOWER OF APPLE SAUCE Quark happily
licks the sauce off his paws

Wayne sighs turns off the machine picks up his notes and
a pencil and flops down on his favorite couch Wayne sits

on it upside down his sauce-spattered head dangling over

the side He stares into space

He sees Quarks head looming before him upside down Quark
begins to lick the applesauce off his masters face

WAYNE
Bummer Quark

The dog licks
WAYNE
On the plus side we have discovered a very
expensive way to make apple sauce

me

THE TEENY-WEENIES 7

The dog finishes his facial snack and trots out of the
room Wayne begins making notes

AMY (0os)
Dad Come and get it

Wayne gets up tucks the pencil behind his right ear and
walks out of the room A beat He returns to the room and
grabs the papers hes left there placing the pencil down
on the couch He leaves the room again A beat He comes
back in and picks up his pencil He exits

INT SZALINSKI KITCHEN DAY

Wayne wanders into the kitchen making notes Hes
diligently studying a haphazardly piled sheaf of papers in
his hands not at all watching where hes going Amy guides
him-so he doesnt collide with either Quark or Nick (this
is something of a tradition) Amy watches her dad

AMY
Dog

Wayne instinctively changes the direction of his left foot
so as not to squash Quark

AMY
Nicholas

Waune pivots still reading his papers so as not to smack
into Nick He makes a move to sit down

AMY
Sewing kit

Wayne has almost sat down on a small table housing a sewing
basket He lifts his rear at the last minute and slides
into the adjoining seat

Nick sighs and begins his morning routine He pops a series

-of pills from prescription bottles and then inserts a

bronchial ashtma inhaler into his mouth He takes several
Darth Vadersounding gulps before facing the food

Amy serves what looks like nuked-out bacon and slimed eggs
to her father as Wayne elbows on table continues to pour
through his notes

AMY
Elbows up

Wayne lifts his elbows She slides the breakfast beneath
him He puts down his notes and stares at the food

WAYNE
Ummm Looks interesting What is it

THE TEENY-WEENIES 8

o—

AMY (embarrassed)
Scrambled eggs

Wayne pute a fork into them The eggs run through the
prongs He stares at the food Amy walks quickly towards a
cabinet drawer

AMY
Ill get you a spoon

Her father reaches for a slice of toast its black He
makes a move to butter it The toast crumbles on impact He
shrugs and goes back to his notes scribbling furiously

AMY
Did you pick up the refill on Nicks
inhaler dad

WAYNE (still scribbling)
Moon

AMY
Dad You promised How could you forget
You were picking up my dress from the
cleaners next door

Wayne “mmmmms” and continue to scribble

AMY

No response

AMY

school dance Friday night

NICK

AMY

Well someone might
WAYNE

Mmmonnn
AMY

NICK

ar amazing electromagnetic pulse device

Co Wayne continues to scribble Nick looks at him expecting a
compliment Amy givea Nick a nyah nyah glance

c™

THE TEENY-WEENIES 9

AMY (muttering)
Youre so obnoxious

The phone rings Wayne stops scribbling and jumps up to get
it taking his notes with him Nick stirs his eggs

NICK
Could I have a straw

Amy snatches his plate away

AMY
Look If you dont want to eat it fine
Quark will

She dumps the breakfast into the dogs bowl Quark sniffs
it and backs away Nick flashes Amy a knowing smug smile

EXT JOHNSON BACKYARD DAY

In the Johnson backyard Ron has disappeared momentarily
Don sits in the tent gazing into the fierce jungle
through binoculars Their pet cat Cicero walks up and
Stares into them Don blinks and looks up Little Russ
continues to work out Ron reappears walking over to Don
Cicero pays no mind

RON
Wanna have some real fun

DON
Youre not going to try to shave

The cat tenses
RON
No better than that Come on

Ron is hiding something behind his back He takes Don to
the fence seperating the two yards and produces a bottle of
sytup

RON
Watch this

DON
Does mom know you have that

Ron doesnt answer He pours a healthy wad of syrup on the
fence Flies begin to land on it They get trapped in it
Ron is delighted

RON (to flies)

The real fun comes when we feed them
to spiders

She fixes a stern look on her face and marches towards the
A backdoor
THE TEENY-WEENIES 17

Little Russ stares down at the weights He sighs and gazes
up at the sky defeated He glances into the next yard Amy
tossing a frisbee with Quark He smiles at her She looks
away Russ sighs and returns to pumping iron

The twins are now playing ball Don pitches a ball to Ron
who proceeds to swat the ball high into the air His home
runs wind up missing Little Russ by inches The ball
whizzes by Cicero The cat screeches Little Russ doenst
even have to look up to realize whos doing the damage

LITTLE RUSS
Knock it off Ron

RON

LITTLE RUSS
Youre going to be dead meat in a minute

Ron continues to swat the ball Nick interested calls to
them from the kitchen window

NICK
Better watch out You might hit that
beehive

He points to a hive in a tree that straddles both yards
Ron isnt impressed

RON
What do you know about baseball baby-
brain You cant play

Ron swings at the next pitch and connects The ball misses
the bee-hive by inches rebounding off the tree and
bouncing back down into the yard Don flashes his brother a
smug smile Ron gulps He faces Nick

RON
Lucky guess

For his next turn at bat however he changes the angle of
his batting position Nick not wanting to take any
chances pulls the screen down on the window knocking a
few legos off the windowsill and into the yard

NICK
Bees can kill you If youre allergic
Im allergic I could die if I got stung

RON

Ron takes a fast swing and sends the pitch sailing over the

is
THE TEENY-WEENIES 18

fence seperating the two yards The ball seems to take
forever to reach its targetit smashes through the
Szalinskis attic window

There is a terrifyingly long second of silence All the
kids exchange petrified glances

DONRON
Uh-oh

Little Russ leaps to his feet

LITTLE RUSS

RON

INT SZALINSKI ATTIC DAY

In the attic we see the ball perched precariously on a
ledge directly above the machines innerworkings It is
slowly teetering on the edge It rolls off and smashes into
the intricate computer chip-laden guts of the machine
nestling in front of the power source of one of the two
particle beam “cannons”

The gizmo sputters to life A complicated computer replete
with screen is hooked up to what looks like two laser
THE TEENY-WEENIES

cannons The computer which analyzes anything placed
before the particle beams goes haywire

The two gun-like devices begin jerking back and forth and

up and down

Only one of the barrels functions however

of a boy-made earthquake They try to struggle to their
feet and stay upright but it’s a losing battle Every time
they stand up theyre thrown to the ground again

Little Russ moves towards them One of his giant feet
smashes the trunk to a pulp The kids scurry about trying
to stay out of the way of Russ’ tennis shoes

Bon slips down into a crack between two floor boards as one
of the shoes hurties down towards the floor Ron hits the
deck as the shoe comes down atop him Hes so small
however that he fits inbetween one of the grooves on the
shoes sole The shoe returns skyward leaving Ron unhurt
Russ continues his wild dance AS THE BEAMS SKITTER BY HIM
FINALLY HE DUCKS WHEN HE SHOULD HAVE DODGED THE BEAMS
CONNECT BZZZAAAP POW

Russ is now insect-sized too He lies on the floor
moaning totally in shock

C) Meanwhile the baseball still balanced on the machinery

tumbles off the invention and onto the floor It rolls
boulder-sized towards the kids They scatter Amy stands
frozen in her tracks as the ball heads directly for her

NICK
Any

Russ sees whats going on and gets to his feet In the best
of football styles he tackles the frightened girl They
both go tumbling out of the way of the titanic ball The
ball barrels into the rest of the tiny pieces of furniture
flattening most of them Amy and Russ stare at each other
as the twins and Nick run up to them Russ helps Amy to her
feet

LITTLE RUSS
Are you all right

AMY
Fine thank you

Without the baseball putting pressure on its inner-
workings the machine hisses to a halt and shuts down

The kids stand confused on the vast attic floor The
a) reality of the situation hits them at once Amy turns
“ angrily towards Russ

AMY
Why didnt you go for help

LITTLE RUSS
How was I to know what was going on
up here

AMY
You could have looked for us

LITTLE RUSS
I did

AMY
Well then you should have moved faster
Ducked the beams

She stands looking down at him He raises himself on his
toes
LITTLE RUSS

of the ball right What do we do now

scientist FREDERICKSON is particularly hard on Wayne

FREDERICKSON

WAYNE (annoyed)
Yes I am Professor Frederickson

FREDERICKSON

ever heard Size is definitive Whats
big is big Whats small is small

The crowd seems to agree with Frederickson

WAYNE
Youre wrong

FREDERICKSON
Wheres your proof You have no proof

Wayne is stuck and he knows at

When Einstein came up with theories that
led to the Atomic Bomb you didnt ask
him to blow one up did you

The children perched on garbage tilted on an angle are
leaning on the twins As the twins cut further the garbage

INT SZALINSKI BACKYARD DAY

The kids and the garbage land in the yard below with a
SPLAT The kids stumble to their feet making disgusted
faces while scraping the bits of egg and bacon off them

RON (proudly)
Nothing to it

He ceremoniously slides his knife back into his pocket All

the kids stop what theyre doing and gape at what lies

ahead They are confronted by a world unlike anything
theyve ever seen From their quarter-inch height the
backyard is a totally alien landscape large green
never-endingdangerous

Before them likes a redwood forest-sized sea of grass
shadowleaden and forboding with only a stray ray of
sunlight or two illuminating the ground The children stare
somberly into the dark forestland The Johnson kids stand
together Nick stands at Amys side Amy begins thinking
outloud
AMY

Our only hope is to get back to the house

If dads machine can shrink us it can

enlarge us too Right Nick

Nick gapes at the never-ending terrain stretching out before
him He is stunned

- NICK (softly)
I suppose he could reverse the process
AMY
Good Then all we have to do is get
across the yard

Nick stares at the yard He begins to cough He pulls out
his inhaler and takes several gulps

LITTLE RUSS (to Amy)
Whats his problem

AMY (softly)
Asthma

Nick continues to wheeze

AMY (to Russ)
Look Maybe you and your brothers had
better go back to the house on your

The kids gaze deep into the Bobdingnagian forest

LITTLE RUSS
Okay So the plan is to get back
to the house right

KIDS (in unison)

They stand there a moment longer looking at each other

AMY
Which way

LITTLE RUSS
Straight ahead I guess

The kids wander deeper into the underbrush There is very
little light They cant see the sky They can hear noises
all around them Buzzing Crackling Chomping Suddenly
os Ron gives out with a Tarzan yell The kids almost drop dead
( from heart attacks
THE TEENY-WEENIES 35

LITTLE RUSS (to Amy)
Hmm He has a point

EXT FORESTYARD DAY

He shinnies up a blade of grass At the top he stares into
the distance

EXT SZALINSKI HOUSE DAY

There looming like a monolithic presence surrounded by
the swirling fog of debris is the Szalinski
houseseemingly a hundred miles away From Russ’ vantage
point it looks like Mt Hood viewed from a great distance

EXT FORESTYARD DAY
The kids cluster around the base of the grass blade

AMY
Can you see the house

LITTLE RUSS
Sure can

Nick breathes a sigh of relief and begins to cough He
takes his asthma inhaler out and gives himself a Darth
Vader shot as Russ shinnies down the grass

LITTLE RUSS
We can probably get there by sundown
Follow me

“AMY

way around this yard You could walk

inhaler and takes a whiff

Are you okay

Uh-huh Its my hayfever Im fine

He smiles Pockets his inhaler Puffs out his chest He
marches straight for the flowers determined to have fun

flower Nick hesitantly tries a bounce on a nearby flower
He lands awkwardly He tries another bound An another He
loses his balance and winds up tumbling onto the ground He
looks around embarrassed Amy and Russ have seen him and

neck and is carried along heels dragging on the ground
He is shaken off and falls at Amys feet

AMY
Pathetic

Russ glances around looking for some way to help He picks
up one of the twins spears Amy looks at the spear
reaches over and bends it easily She looks at THE
RAMPAGING ANT The spear isnt going to work Amy

spots the fallen crumb and runs towards it

THE ANT CONTINUES TO REEL AROUND Amy takes a wad of cookie
in her hand and walks directly in front of the charging
ant Nick still sitting dazed in the dirt is horrified
He is coughing and wheezing
THE TEENY-WEENIES 59

No Amy Look out

Amy swallows hard and holds her ground The ant goes
skidding to a stop The twins go tumbling from its back
The ant slowly approaches Amy antennae twitching Amy
gazes into the face of the little ant She crinkles her
nose Its repulsive The ant calmly walks over and gently
removes the small pliece of crumb from her hand It munches
on it merrily

Little Russ walks up to the ant and slips a grass lariet
around its neck The ant munching merrily allows it

The twins are both dizzy They stagger up to Amy

RON

in the palm of his hand He looks at the machine At first he
is elated Then the reality of the situation hits him

Then soberly

WAYNE
My god It works

He stands and like an Indian rubber man trying to levitate
off the ground carefully walks over to Diane on his tip-toes

smaller than a button

notices Wayne and Diane They dont spot Big Russ however
He sees the neighbors whispering into the large trashbags
as they tweeze their way through the gunk

o towards him and gives him a brief but tender first kiss

EXT FORESTYARD NIGHT

We see the tiny kids illuminated from above by the pale blue
light of a full moon The CAMERA slowly moves up and away
from them taking the whole titanic yard into view

Big Russ begins to laugh He looks at Diane Shes not

BIG RUSS

Diane places the tiny couch in Big Russ’ hand

BIG RUSS
So what A toy Big deal That doesnt

WAYNE (adjusting the gizmo)

pedestal

BIG RUSS (aghast)
My Olympian cap

WAYNE
Yes Yes You want proof dont you

Russ slowly lifts the hat from his head He is inundated by
a shower of cigarettes He gazes at his hat nervously

THE TEENY-WEENIES 77

BIG RUSS
Ive had this cap for twenty years

Wayne gets the machine humming Big Russ gingerly places
the cap on the pedestal in front of the metal wall

WAYNE
Okay Step back and be amazed

Wayne activates the machine BOTH BEAMS SKITTER ACROSS THE
ROOM Big Russ is not impressed

BIG RUSS
Big deal I have a lava light
at home that works better

WAYNE
Watch when the beams connect

Diane and Big Russ watch AS THE TWO BEAMS HONE IN ON THE
CAP THE CAP SHIMMERS QUIVERS FINALLY IT EXPLODES
SENDING BITS AND PIECES OF CHARRED MATERIAL EVERYWHERE
Diane gasps in horror Wayne is perplexed Big Russ is
stunned

WAYNE
I dont understand it It must have
worked before

BIG RUSS
Are you saying my kidsthat machine

you blew up my kids

He makes a move to strangle Wayne Wayne ignoring lunging
Big Russ walks over to the cap fragments

WAYNE
Of course not If they had blown up we
would have found
Diane gasps

WAYNE
I mean No They shrunk Im positive

BIG RUSS
And Im positive that you should be
locked up I dont know what your game

done anything to my kidsI1l do to you
what you did to my genuine number-one-in-

He makes a move to stalk out of the room He glances
nervously at the floor and tip-toes carefully out staring
this way and that at the floor

Wayne stares at the machine sadly

Diane gently walks up to him and puts his arm around hin
She gives him a gentle squeeze

DIANE
How about a drink

Wayne nods yes and the two leave the attic

INT KITCHEN NIGHT

Wayne sits at the kitchen table a half-filled glass of milk
before him Wayne fingers the magnifying glass absent-minded-
ly Diane toys with the flashlight Wayne smiles sadly

WAYNE
Its all my fault Its all my fault

DIANE
No Youre just dedicated I should have
understood that You have dreams

WAYNE
But I forget reality I ignore the people
I care about the most

DIANE ‘
Oh Wayne How could I have left you
and the kidsif anything happens to

Wayne places the magnifying glass softly on the table top
Diane lays down the flashlight They sit in silence for a
long minute Tears begin to roll down Dianes face Wayne
pulls his chair next to hers and puts a protective arm
around her He knocks over a salt shaker in the process

WAYNE
Well find them hon I promise
Well find them

Diane places her head against his chest and cries Wayne -
swallows hard wipes a single tear from one eye and hugs
her closer

The scene gradually brightens Morning has come We now see
that the children have made it all the way to the yards
edge They are nestled in the Lego toys that Nick had
dropped there the day before In the background the
Szalinski home stands as tall as a glacier

Russ wakes up first He stretches yawns opens his eyes
and turn around

LITTLE RUSS

squeals with delight and gives Russ a big hug

faces are glun

BEFORE THEM STANDS THE BIGGEST STEP IN HISTORY A STRUCTURE
AS BIG AS A CITY HALL

LITTLE RUSS
Uh its a little bigger than I

THE TEENY-WEENIES 80

He frantically looks around for something to scale the step
with He finds a small twig He places it against the step
like a ladder Its pathetically small like placing a step-
ladder against a skyscraper

The rest of the children look on nervously

LITTLE RUSS
Dont worry Ill figure something out

Amys lower lip begins to quiver Russ tries to cheer her up

LITTLE RUSS
Dont worry Well make it We
just have to come up with a plan

Tears begin to dribble silently down Amys face

The twins and Nick exchange frightened glances This is the
first time Amy has really acted like a (gasp) girl Nick
approaches her He kneels next to her

NICK
Amy Dont cry Amy Come on Even if
the odds are against us so what
People beat the odds all the time right

LITTLE RUSS

DON
Yeah Weve gotten through a flood

RON
And killer bees

NICK
And a power mower

RON

Amy sniffs and nods only half believing

AMY
But how will we get inside the house

Nick stands up suddenly He stares at the door and smiles
He has an idea Placing two fingers in his mouth he emits
a shrill whistle Hes winded after one try Wheeze Wheeze

LITTLE RUSS

He puffs out his little chest again and lets out a second

shrill blast

EXT STREET DAY

Quark darts into the street Hes a yard dog and totally
panics when outside his turf As soon as Quark darts into the
street Cicero skids to a stop curbside and watches wide-
eyed as the dog skitters around in traffic Quark zig-zags up
and down the street in and out of traffic yelping

EXT DOG DAY

The kids scream as titanic cars and people pass them by Horns
blare Tires screech People yell Its like being caught on
an out-of-control plane zipping through the canyons of New
York City

NICK
Whoa Quark Whoah

Look out

We see a titanic car bearing down on the dog from one side
Little Russ spins around and points Theres a car approaching
from the other side too

EXT STREET DAY

We see Quark paralyzed with fear as the two cars come
speeding towards him from both sides The dog doesnt move
Quark lays down in the street and closes his eyes

EXT DOG DAY

The kids dive down on Quarks head as deafening screeches and
horns shake the sky They close their eyes CRAASSSHHHHH

Quark opens his eyes and gets up The two cars have crashed
and are suspended pyramid style above him The two drivers
are screaming at each other from inside the car Quark trots

The dogs head straightens as he slides off the table leg
Russ scans the roon

LITTLE RUSS
We have to get on that table somehow

NICK (pointing)
Quark can drop us off there

He points to the shorter more accessable sewing stool
standing less than a foot from the kitchen table

AMY
Take us to the sewing table Quark
Over there boy Come on

INT KITCHEN DAY
Quark trots over to the table
INT SEWING TABLE DAY

The kids leap off the dog and stand on the table The
kitchen table looms before them a mammoth chasm separating
the two pieces of furniture

RON
Great Now all we need is a helicopter

DON
Can we throw things at them to wake
them up

RON
What are we going to throw

Ron points to a thimble four times his size

RON
Want to try chucking this Hercules

AMY
Cut it out Well think of something

Russ roams around the sewing table Even the regular-sized
needles are titanic He comes across a small portable sewing

kit the kind you buy in a five and dime store or get for free

in a hotel It consists of a small envelope a few tiny but-

THE TEENY-WEENIES 87

Ld tons and needles 14 the size of your everyday household
needles

Russ picks up one of the small needles by one end Its far
too big to throw

AMY
Can you throw it

LITTLE RUSS
Not a chance

He begins prowling around again All the kids do Nick
trips over a small rubber band Russ grins

LITTLE RUSS
Maybe we can shoot it though

Ron grabs the rubber band

RON
Not a bad idea

DON
This genius stuff is spreading

Russ takes a small spool of thread and places a strand of
thread through the needle He hooks one end of the thread
to a splinter in the table-top anchoring it He then makes
sure that the spool holding the rest of the thread is
jammed tightly down on a large needle stuck into a pin
cushion in the sewing kit

LITTLE RUSS
This ought to hold Maybe we can shoot
this thing at your dad If we hit hin
hes sure to wake up and spot us

RON
Suppose we miss

Little Russ points to the way the needle is threaded
LITTLE RUSS
Its like a harpoon If we miss we pull
it back and try againI hope

Russ walks up to the rubber band puzzling over it He tries
to stretch it between the points of a scissor It pops off

DON (looking at a nearby spool)
We can make a spool cannon

( My
Ne

He takes a small spool of thread and rolls it on its side in
front of the rubber band The kids take the rubber band and

NA

THE TEENY-WEENIES 88

stretch it around the spool Russ takes the needle and
places it inside the round cylinder

The kids hold the side of the spool Russ grabs the end of
the needle places it against the rubber band strung around

the spool and slowly pulls the needle back Further
Further Finally its 75 out of the cannon muzzle

LITTLE RUSS
Great idea

He peeks through the spool barrel of the cannon The other
kids take their places on either side of the spool

He peeks through the spool barrel of the cannon The other
kids take their places on either side of the spool

A little to the left

The kids push the spool

LITTLE RUSS (straining)
Ready Aim Firell

He lets the needle go

INT KITCHEN DAY

The rubber band recoils with a spronnnng The needle soars
towards the table the spool of thread its affixed to
whirling madly

INT KITCHEN DAY

The needle goes sailing past Wayne and winds up embedding
itself in an orange resting in a fruit dish in the middle of
the table Sploosh

EXT SEWING TABLE DAY

The kids stare at the far off orange

RON
Were sunk

LITTLE RUSS
No were not Lets just pull it back

They tug on the thread trying to dislodge the needle from the
orange It wont budget As one the children stop yanking on
the thread

RON
Now were sunk

They gaze at the kitchen table Its only one or two normal
sized feet away but a good mile or so from the kids point of
view Spanning the chasm between the sewing stool and the
kitchen table are two strands of thread hooked into the
needle Nick “twangs the thread It quivers but seems very
very solid

LITTLE RUSS (smiling at Nick)
Ever gone tightrope walking

NICK (nervously)
No

Russ trots over to the spool of thread still attached to
the needle He pulls the thread taut around another needle
causing the newly formed rope bridge to tighten He then
walks over to the edge of the sewing table

LITTLE RUSS
The only were going to get onto
that table is to climb over

RON
Like on a rope bridge

LITTLE RUSS
Right Like in scouts

Ron looks at the linoleum floor miles below them

RON
No offense but in scoutsthey never
asked us to climb over the Grand Canyon

LITTLE RUSS
You have a better idea

AMY
Russell Nick will never make it

NICK (defiantly)
Yes I will

LITTLE RUSS (thoughtfully)
Amy might be right Nick We can
wake up your dad and come back for
you here

NICK (bristling)
No way We all go together
THE TEENY-WEENIES 90

Ko Ron and Don pat Nick on the back

RON
Way to go scout

DON (to others)
Hell make it No sweat

Russ looks at the double stranded rope bridge before then

“LITTLE RUSS
Ill go first The trick is to
move slowly and evenly

He gets on the rope bridge grabbing the top strand of the
thread with his hands and sliding his feet onto the bottom
strand

LITTLE RUSS
We wont be climbing as much as pulling
ourselves across Understand

The kids nod Theyre scared stiff

LITTLE RUSS
Okay Lets go

Amy gets on the rope bridge next Her knees almost buckle
as the bottom strand wiggles under her weight

LITTLE RUSS
Easy Dont be afraid Just hold
on tight with your hands Thats it

The twins are next on Ron gulps looks down at the dizzy
view grits his teeth and climbs on Don takes a deep
breath and does the same -

DON
I wish I was home watching TV

RON
You and me both

Nick stands on the edge of the table He gapes at the floor
far below and then at the kitchen table standing tow-
ering at the other end of the bridge He glances at Quark
Quark cocks his head flattens ‘his ears and whines

NICK
I know just how you feel

Nick takes a deep breath and gets on the bridge He shuts
his eyes for a moment and exhales

INT KITCHEN DAY

The thread wobbles constantly as the teeny-weenies slowly
inch their way across the rope bridge

LITTLE RUSS
Slow and steady Fine Fine Can
you all say that Slow and steady
and slow and steady

The kids begin to chant slow and steady as they
rhythmically work their way across the bridge The bridge
begins to tilt upwards towards the table top THE CAMERA
slowly pans across the frightened faces of the children as
they chant and begin the trek upwards for the last fifteen
inches or so

EXT TABLE DAY

We see a slight tug on the thread attached to the needle The

needle still embedded in the orange begins to jiggle
slightly

Wayne and Diane sit sleeping at the table

INT KITCHEN DaY

Quark sits in the corner amazed at the goings on
INT KITCHEN DAY

Still chanting slow and steady the kids continue their
crossing Suddenly Amy loses her footing She shrieks her
feet dangling in the air

LITTLE RUSS
Just hang on Hang on -

She desperately tries to get her feet back on the bottom
strand of thread Her lack of balance causes the other kids
to sway dangerously on the thread The kids shout as they
try to steady themselves Slowly Amy regains her footing

LITTLE RUSS
Are you okay

AMY
Ive been better

LITTLE RUSS
Okay Were almost there Slow
and steady Everybody Slow and steady

The thread suddenly begins to quiver
THE TEENY-WEENIES 92

AMY
Whats wrong

LITTLE RUSS (alarmed)
I dont know Come on Faster
Fast and steady Fast and steady

RON
Make up your mind

EXT TABLE DAY
On the table top we see that the needle-anchor is beginning

to work itself loose from the orange in a big way Each twinge
on the thread caused by the kids feet and hands is making the

needle wriggle more

INT KITCHEN DAY

The kids are pulling themselves upward for their lives
They are a mere inch or two from the table top The thread
is jiggling madly now

LITTLE RUSS
Come on Hurry

“RON
I dont like this

DON
You think I do

Nick cant speak Hes wheezing now pulling his own weight
furiously He begins to gasp The other kids turn and stare as
Nick launches into a full tilt asthma attack He desperately
reaches into his pocket for his inhaler He produces it but it
tumbles out of his hand tumbling towards the floor far below
He is gasping for breath His face is red

‘Russ turns towards him

RUSS
Nick you dont need that junk
Youre going to be all right
Take deep steady breaths Okay
Try it Slowly

Nick begins breathing in and out in and out in and out
Gradually he stops gasping

RUSS
Better

Nick nods his head He is scared stiff
THE TEENY-WEENIES 93

The floor seems to sway below the children
They continue to-climb
EXT TABLE DAY
The needle continues to wriggle
INT KITCHEN DAY
Russ is within a hair of the table top when
EXT TABLE TOP DAY

The pin sprongs loose from the orange The needle begins to
slide across the table

INT KITCHEN DAY

Russ holds desperately onto the edge of the table as the
thread goes limp The kids lose their footing and cling to
the thread as it drops down like an elevator sans shaft

The needle zips along the table top coming to an abrupt halt
as it hits the lip of the table and gets wedged in the
formica Russ climbs ontop of the table and grabs the thread

LITTLE RUSS
Hold on Hold on

Amy Ron Don and Nick cling to the thread Russ begins to
pull the thread taut using every ounce of his strength

LITTLE RUSS
Try to climb Try

Russ clings desperately to the thread holding it as
tightly as he can He puts all his weight behind it

Onthe thread the remaining children have to climb hand
over hand up the thread wrapping their legs around the
lone taut strand

Amy gets to the top of the table and pulls herself up and
over She leans down and grabs Ron She pulls Ron up Russ
holds the thread desperately Ron pulls Don up

Now the only child remaining dangling from the needle is

Nick
RON
Come on Grab the thread
) Ron and Don grab the thread and with their brother hold

it taut Amy grabs on and pulls back trying to give Nick
every advantage Amy the closest to the edge of the table
NX

THE TEENY-WEENIES 94

gazes down at Nick terrified In spite of the tautness of
the thread she doesnt think the little boy will make it

AMY (to the boys)
Can you handle this thread

Russ and the twins nod yes straining Amy still holding
the thread calls down to Nick

AMY
Nick Stay there Im coming down to
get you

Nick stares at the table top above him

NICK (wheezing)
No I can do it I can do it
by myself

Nick slowly laboriously begins to shinny up the taut
thread Hand over hand over hand Knees wrapped tightly
around the thread Hand over hand Knee up Knee up

Amy watches silently as Nick grimly continues his ascent

AMY (to Russ)
Hell never do it

LITTLE RUSS
Sure he will Come on Nick

RONDON
Come on Nick Come on

With the boys chanting for him to make it Nick pushes
upward His face is red with exhaustion His forehead is a
mass of sweat droplets He climbs and climbs and then stops

He is an inch away from the table top the kids all
cheering him on

Nick gazes down at the floor below hin
The view is dizzying

He sees Amys worried face above him Taking a deep wheezing
breath he begins to climb again Finally he makes it to the
table top Amy extends a hand and pulls him up and onto the
top

Don Ron and Russ let the thread go and run-towards little
Nick The needle becomes unstuck and zips by them and over
the edge of the table It tumbles in seemingly slow
motion towards the floor below The kids surround Nick
THE TEENY-WEENIES 95

Vou NICK (wheezing)
I told you I could do it

RON
So who said you couldnt

DON
I knew you could do it all along

Russ winks at Nick Nick shrugs

NICK
Lets get dad

EXT TABLE TOP DAY

The kids run across the vast expanse of the table and stand
in front of the slumbering parents They walk up to Wayne
whose head is on the table and yell into his ear

AMYNICK

LITTLE RUSS

RON
Yo Over here

No response THe sleeping parents still sit mountain-like
in their chairs

AMY
Forget it They cant hear us

RON
I wish we still had that needle Id
jam it in

DON
Well never wake them up

LITTLE RUSS
And when they do wake up theyll
need a neon sign to see us

Nick gazes glumly at the table top He sees the mound of
salt Wayne has spilled the night before He gazes at it

Nick turns to Ron and Don
NICK
Lo When explorers get lost in the snow
— they make snow signs right

THE TEENY-WEENIES 96

RON
Yeah

He points to the salt

DON
A salt sign

The kids turn and focus on the mound of salt Ron smiles
pointing to the abandoned magnifying glass

RON
That ought to help too

DON
Lion scouts to the rescue

Ron and Don and run to the salt mound and begin laboriously
fashioning a large arrow leading to the magnifying glass

LITTLE RUSS (smiling)
Sometimes Im almost proud of those guys

Russ Amy and Nick join in the construction of the arrow
The finished work is some three inches long the arrow
head pointing to the magnifying glass

Once the arrow is finished the kids all huddle beneath the
magnifying glass

NICK
When dad wakes up hell have to
see us

They look pretty tired They could
sleep all day

He runs to the food bowl Theres no food there The dog
turns puzzled towards the table

to whine and bark again circling his empty bowl
Waynes eyes flutter

The kids begin to dance and wave under the magnifying glass
Wayne wakes up and launches into his habitual morning sneezes
A sudden gale of wind blows across the table top

LITTLE RUSS

The kids cling to each other as they are buffeted by the
wind Half of the salt arrow is blown away

He gets up to leave the table when Quark suddenly leaps
onto his lap and then onto the table

THE TEENY-WEENIES 98

The kids continue to wave and yell Diane leans down
towards them

DIANE

RON (even though he cant be
heard)
You should have seen us ten minutes ago

She makes a move to grab the kids They duck Wayne
restrains her

WAYNE

She pulls her hand back
WAYNE
Theyre too small to handle We may
hurt them

DIANE
Thats right

He faces the kids gently lifting up the magnifying glass
WAYNE
Dont worry guys Youre safe now
Wait right there
The twins look at each other

RON
Where does he expect us to go

Amy hugs Russ

LITTLE RUSS
Everything is going to be all right now

Nick smiles collapsing into a sitting position Phew

Wayne brings a spoon over to the table and sets it down
next to the children

WAYNE
Can you make it up here

Nick is the first one to leap into the spoon

NICK
Come on slowpokes

Russ and Amy share an amused grin and climb into the spoon

THE TEENY-WEENIES 99

The twins follow with a whoop

EXT SPOON DAY

Wayne carefully lifts the spoon

INT KITCHEN DAY

He heads for the stairs leading up to the attic

WAYNE (to Diane)
Get the Johnsons over here Ill warm
up the machine

Quark leaps off the table and follows

AMY (from the spoon)
Youre a hero Quark That was a
two milkbone move

The dog wags its tail merrily
INT ATTIC DAY

In the attic Wayne carefully places the spoon in the target
area of the room while Diane holds Quark in her arms A
stricken Mae Johnson stands nervously next to her linking her
arm in Dianes Big Russ is dumbfounded and as usual irate

BIG RUSS
Youre a maniac Szalinski Do you realize
what youve done Theyre ruined for life

WAYNE
I have the atomic makeup computed

Wayne adjusts the computer focusing it on the children

BIG RUSS
If you hurt them any more Szalinski Ill
personally re-do your house with my
bulldozer

WAYNE
Now I have to figure the amount of space
needed to be placed between their atoms

MAE
Please hurry

WAYNE
Its done Now to add an extra dollop
of energy to replace the energy they
lost when shrinking

He makes a move to turn on the machine Big Russ tenses

BIG RUSS
If you blow them up

Wayne withdraws his arm

DIANE

INT ATTIC FLOOR DAY
The kids stare at each other confused

RON
Some genius

NICK -
Give him time Hell figure
something out

INT ATTIC DAY

WAYNE (scratching his head)
Somehow the kids stumbled onto something
that Ive been overlooking

He then notices the twins’ baseball still resting on the
floor He smiles

WAYNE
Russ toss me that ball

BIG RUSS
I oughtta bean you with this ball

He picks up the baseball and tosses it to Wayne Wayne
studies it He gazes at the burn mark on the ball He then
makes some adjustments in the machinery

WAYNE
The answer has been right under my
nose all along

BIG RUSS
You like baseball
THE TEENY-WEENIES 101

C) WAYNE

The machine uses two beams a laser tracking
beam and the actual shrinking beam The
tracking beam focuses the second beam on

the target The reason things have been
blowing up instead of shrinking is that
when the beams collide they generate too
much heat Yesterday this ball must have
blocked the tracking beam The shrinking
beam worked all on its own Now all I have
to do is shut off the one beam

He throws the switch into on position again THE MACHINE
SPUTTERS TO LIFE THE BEAMS GO SKITTERING THROUGH SPACE

WAYNE
Lets see if it works I need a
a target

BIG RUSS
You already blew up my hat

Wayne looks about He realizes he still has the ball in his
hand He tosses the ball before the beams THE BALL IS
ZAPPED AND MINATURIZES THE TINY BALL FALLS NEXT TO THE

oan CHILDREN Nick turns to Ron

NICK
I told you hed figure it out

Big Russ -is impressed He turns to Mae

BIG RUSS
Did you see that

WAYNE
Now all I have to do is reverse the
polarity of the beam andadd some
energy

THE MACHINE BEGINS TO HUM THE ATTIC LIGHTS DIM AND
FLICKERS

WAYNE
Come on You can do it Come on

THE PARTICLE BEAMS GO SKITTERING THROUGH SPACE TOWARDS THE
FLOOR

INT ATTIC FLOOR DAY

INT ATTIC DAY

The parents watch amazed as the little kids hurl
themselves into the beams RUSS IS STRUCK BY ONE

HE BEGINS TO GROW AND GROW AND GROW

Big Russ’ mouth drops open and Quarks ears flop straight
back as RUSS GROWS FIVE FEET TALL SIX FEET TALL TEN FEET
TALL FIFTEEN FEET

HIS HEAD CRACKS OUT OF THE ROOF OF THE ATTIC HIS FEET
SUPPORTING THE TOO HEAVY WEIGHT OF HIS BODY BREAK THROUGH
THE FLOOR

Wayne begins tinkering happily with the machine

WAYNE
A few small adjustments Not to worry

RUSS REACHES DOWN AND PICKS UP HIS FATHER HOLDING HIM HIGH

electromagnetic pulse device to restore
our size

NICK
And thats how it happened

LITTLE RUSS
Really

Wayne smiles and steps up to the podium
WAYNE

You asked for proof gentlemen Here

is your proof Three living subjects

who have proven that size can be altered

He is nearly laughed out of the hall Dr Frederickson
leads the jeering

FREDERICKSON
Its a fairy tale Szalinski You can
hardly call the stories ofchildren

Mae and a very very smug Big Russ (wearing a brand new
Olympian cap)

BIG RUSS (muttering)
Damned eggheads

WAYNE
I thought you might consider this all
far-fetched

He smiles and exchanges knowing glances with the three
children on the stage ©

WAYNE
So I brought along a um visual aid
Dr Frederickson Would you be so kind as
to open the back doors

Puzzled Frederickson moves towards the doors He swaggers
actually a know-it-all in control The doors burst open
and the twins gallop into the room on the back of their
NOW-GIANT ANT RON HOLDS A FULL BAG OF OREOS BEFORE THE
EVER-HUNGRY INSECT THE ANT CHASES FREDERICKSON AROUND THE
ROOM

The scientists gasp and scatter Big Russ stands emitting
a roaring laugh

BIG RUSS
I love it I love ittit

Dr Frederickson is panting horrified at the monster
pursuing him

FREDERICKSON
Call it off Call it off Youll
get the grant Halp Halp

In-a corner Dr Brainard smiles whimsically He casually
lights his pipe

BRAINARD
Interesting

THE ANT SKITTERS ROUND AND ROUND THE ROOM CHASING
FREDERICKSON AND THE OREOS

Quark yipes from the stage then jumps out of Nicks arms
and begins chasing the ant barking at it Diane and the
Johnsons walk up to Wayne Russ slaps him on the back The
two men share a hearty laugh

THE ANT GALLOPS UP ONE WALL ACROSS THE CEILING AND DOWN
THE OPPOSITE WALL THE TWINS WHOOPING QUARK BARKING
THE TEENY-WEENIES

The scientists continue to scramble Frederickson continues
to run for his life QUARK CHASES THE ANT THE ANT TURNS
AND CURIOUSLY CHECKS QUT THE LITTLE DOG QUARK TURNS TAIL

AND RUNS AWAY WHINING

On the stage Little Russ Amy and Nick watch the
scientists dodge and duck and Frederickson scream

NICK
I think theyre impressed

Amy and Russ nod laughing

Wayne and Diane stand hand in hand watching the
scientists cower under their chairs

THE TWINS WHOOPING LIKE WILD INDIANS CONTINUE TO
AROUND TRE ROOM ON THEIR ANT In the middle of the
panedemonium the Johnson family and the Szalinski
stand side by side Friends Neighbors
