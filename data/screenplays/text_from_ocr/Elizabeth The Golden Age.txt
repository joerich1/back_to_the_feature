Christendom Philip of Spain has

INT HALLWAYSALON ESCORIAL PALACE - DAY

Philip walks rapidly down a long corridor that opens out
into a broader hallway moving from the darkness of the
chapel into ever brighter light and more visible glory On
his face the far shining gaze of a man who now knows his
mission Silent servants press themselves to the walls as
he goes by Through the hallway to a grand salon COURTIERS
fall silent and bow as he passes So into the grandest
salon of all where his magnificent court is gathered
among them his 12-year-old daughter the INFANTA As he
enters all kneel

His eyes scan his ministers and courtiers all kneeling
heads bowed before him His gaze falls on one who wears the
plain black robes of a Jesuit priest Robert Reston the
face we glimpsed in the opening montage He speaks to all

PHILIP
(God has made his will known to
me The time for our great
enterprise has come)

The Jesuit looks up and his eyes too show a powerful but
disciplined satisfaction He murmurs softly to himself

RESTON
At last

Cathedral bells ring out The cheers of a crowd are heard
through the open windows

The king passes out onto the salons first-floor balcony

EXT BALCONY ESCORIAL PALACE - DAY

Hot sunlight Philip stands gazing across the plaza at the
great cathedral on the far side as the bells ring out and
the CROWD in the plaza below wave their hats and cheer The
nfanta is by his side His MINISTERS cluster behind him
Lining the crowd on either side of the plaza stand columns
of ARMED SOLDIERS a formidable reminder of the kings
power

Philip does nothing but his presence intoxicates the
crowd As their cries swell wave upon wave the kings
eyes glow and he breathes in deeply feeding on his
peoples adoration

EXT THAMES - DAY

A ripple of light on the water A blur of approaching
colour

its hull gaily painted its canopy adorned with colourful
fabrics its banks of oars rising and falling casting
bright shards of shining water in the sunlight

P

eople passing on the river bank point and wave smiling
cheering They see the Queen now They call out

Two young men walking arm-in-arm stare more intently than
any but they do not cheer or wave Theres something
chilling in the way they track the distant figure of the
Queen

They are BABINGTON and SAVAGE
Over this an insistent voice

HOWARD (VO)

Mary Stuart is a Queen cast out
by her own ungrateful nation

HATTON
With respect majesty - a

Catholic Queen Your loyal
Protestant supporters dont
understand why Mary Stuart lives

under our protection at our
expense - very considerable
expense —

is a beacon that draws our

rebellion Majesty we have
proven reason to fear every
Catholic in the land -

beliefs Only for their deeds

England love their Queen My
constant endeavour is to earn
that love

Walsingham shares a rueful smile with William that says
“Women eh They take their seats for dinner

INT GREAT HALL WHITEHALL PALACE - DAY

Elizabeth sits sumptuously gowned and jewelled at an
ornately-dressed dining table surrounded by her ladies
Bess among them Walsingham discreetly in the background
Theyre listening to a young Austrian make a formal speech
of love The AUSTRIAN AMBASSADOR stands to one side
mouthing the words to prompt him

The ARCHDUKE CHARLES is still a boy sixteen years old
slight pale trembling with shyness He struggles through
his rehearsed speech

ARCHDUKE CHARLES

Your majestys beauty is dazzling
to my eyes Your learning is
famed throughout Europe I see
before me perfection in human

form Oh Elizabeth How blessed
am I to stand in your fabled
presence warmed by your

greatness as by the rays of the
sun Oh Elizabeth To speak your
name is to hear celestial music

May that sweet sound guide me
through my life to come -

Elizabeth Elizabeth I have

travelled here to this
illustrious court in the hope
that our two great nations might

be joined in love But now that I
am bathed in the radiance of your
glory I am overwhelmed I am

conquered I die Only your love
great Elizabeth can restore me
to life
c
ourtiers exchange smiles at his efforts The Spaniards
sneer openly But Elizabeth takes the charade with due
gravity

LIZABETH
Your highness does me great
honour Shall we eat our dinner
It should prove almost as
restorative as my love

Raleigh enters the Great Hall trailed by Calley as the
dinner gets under way They join the much larger group who
simply stand and watch Royal meals are in part a spectacle
for the court A JESTER moves from group to group playing
pranks on the guests

Green Revision May 25 - p29A

Raleigh is now dressed in court fashion and looks very
well as the glances of several court ladies show He
catches Besss eye and they share a smile

COURT LADY
So tell me Mr Raleigh in your
sea battles - how do you sink an
enemy ship You shoot holes in
its sides I suppose

(

May 1 Blue Draft - p30

RALEIGH
No maam A sunk ship is of no
value The object is to capture
and command

COURT LADY
And how do you do that

RALEIGH
Surprise Speed Irresistible
violence

Calley listening rolls his eyes

Elizabeth at the table with the Archduke by her side
glances towards Raleigh and sees him flirting with the
court ladies Then back to the young Archduke who has
hardly touched his food

ELIZABETH

I think youre not as accustomed

as I am to eating in public I

have a secret

he moves one hand before her face indicating an imaginary
pane of glass As she looks she sees Bess staring at
someone - follows her gaze - and is amused to find that the
object of her attention is also Raleigh

ELIZABETH
They can see me but they cant
hear me or touch me You should
try it

She beckons to Bess

ELIZABETH
Bess

Bess comes forward

ELIZABETH

He interests me Talk to him

BESS

ELIZABETH

Bess turns and looks across towards Raleigh as he flirts
with the court ladies

Green Revision May 25 - p31

Elizabeth turns back to her guest

ELIZABETH
His highness is tired after his
journey

The young Archduke frozen with shyness sits staring
before him trembling as he frames a proper reply

ARCHDUKE CHARLES
No man can be tired in the
presence of so lovely a Queen
E
lizabeth speaks so only he can hear in German

ELIZABETH
(You play the game very well my
young friend But dont you

sometimes feel an overwhelming

desire to say what youre really

thinking)
The Archdukes eyes open very wide He glances at
Elizabeth and sees on her face a conspiratorial smile

ARCHDUKE CHARLES
(I darent even think what Im
really thinking)

ELIZABETH
(Youre thinking perhaps that

you would far rather be home)

ARCHDUKE CHARLES
(Youre very wise madame)

Hes grateful to her and his shy face shows it
Raleigh is still being entertained by the court ladies
COURT LADY
I adore the natives you brought
back with you I dont suppose
you could get one for me Theyre
not dangerous are they
RALEIGH
That depends what you propose to
do with them
COURT LADY
Id dress him up in mulberry-
coloured silk and have him walk
behind me carrying my cloak

Green Revision May 25 - p31A
Bess has now approached Raleigh

BESS
The pirate is not too bored by
the vanities of the court I
hope

RALEIGH
A simple sailor dazzled by the
bright lights

Bess draws him away from the court ladies

BESS
If you can bring yourself to
leave the dazzle of the bright
lights for a moment -

May 1 Blue Draft - p32

RALEIGH
D
rawn away by the brightest light
of all
BESS

That can only mean the Queen

RALEIGH
I dont presume to raise my eyes
so high

They both look at the Queen Shes watching Raleigh He
bows
BESS
It seems youve presumed after
all

RALEIGH
It seems youre determined to
think the worst of me

BESS
Tell me what it is you really
want

RALEIGH

What every man wants Money
Fame Love

BESS
In that order

RALEIGH
Each leads to the next The money
will buy and equip ships for a
return voyage to the New World
The success of my infant colony
there will make me famous The
fame will bring me love

BESS
It seems rather a long way round

RALEIGH
There are benefits along the way
It is something after all to
take a blank on the map and build
there a shining city

BESS
Which you will no doubt name
after yourself

May 1 Blue Draft - p33
RALEIGH
(smiling)

No doubt B

ESS
Well then I am answered

RALEIGH
May I ask a question in return
BESS
Of course

RALEIGH
How am I to win the Queens
favour

BESS

Why should I tell you that sir

RALEIGH
Ive little enough to offer I
know But whatever I have to give
- ask and its yours

Bess thinks for a moment

BESS
My advice to you is say what you
mean to say as plainly as
possible All men flatter the
Queen in the hope of advancement
Pay her the compliment of truth

She gives him her hand He kisses it

RALEIGH
I dont even know your name

BESS
Elizabeth Throckmorton

RALEIGH
A second Elizabeth

BESS
Everyone calls me Bess
Ss
he goes back to the Queen as Elizabeth is rising to
leave She speaks to the company

ELIZABETH
His highness the Archduke informs
me that my charms overwhelm him
He will retire to his private
quarters to rest

This causes much amusement Don Guerau sneers openly The
Archduke rises All rise The Archduke bows solemnly to the
Queen and leaves with his entourage Elizabeth beckons to
Walsingham and speaks low to him

ELIZABETH
Hes a sweet boy I dont want
him hurt by your schemes

INT QUEENS PRIVATE QUARTERS - DAY

Bess is reading to Elizabeth Elizabeth watching her her
mind elsewhere

ELIZABETH
I suspect him of being a
professional charmer Am I right

BESS
He is certainly charming my
lady

ELIZABETH

There are duller professions And
what is it he hopes to gain by
his charms

BESS
He hopes for glory in his New
World He dreams of building a
shining city

ELIZABETH

Which Im to pay for no doubt
(Beat)

You like him dont you

BESS
Its refreshing to meet a man who
looks to a world beyond the
court

ELIZABETH
So it is We shall let him come

again

Paulet smiles at the notion of Mary naked
PAULET

That was not my motive maam

Your laundress was found to be

carrying letters in her washing
Not her job I think

She turns to go but stops before leaving the room bitter
haughty not deigning to look back
MARY
They say shes a beautiful woman

Is she so very beautiful
PAULET

I dont presume to comment on the
Queens person

MARY
Shes called the virgin queen
Why is that sir Can it be that

no man will have her

Mary changes mood again thinking it more politic to keep
the Warden under her spell She waves Annette and the
laundress away

MARY
My friend forgive me You are my

Horses racing hoofs pounding over the grass manes flying -
Two riders hurtle between the trees down a woodland ride
neck and neck-
Elizabeth and Raleigh are racing against each other faces
glowing laughing abandoned to the breakneck speed of the
moment

Raleigh is winning now first by a head then by a length
At the end of the ride he slows his horse to a walk

RALEIGH

Elizabeth shakes her head unable to speak

ELIZABETH

You have - the stronger horse

in the horse)

You want a friend not just an
equal You want someone to share
your joy when youre happy

Double Blue - july 8 - p43B
ELIZABETH (contd)
Someone to cry with when youre
sad Someone to talk to when
theres nothing to say Someone
to find by your side when you

She turns to him with a smile
ELIZABETH (CONTD)
Ah yes I know all about it
There Im rested now
She turns her horse around in the direction from which they
came Raleigh follows

She spurs her horse and suddenly shes racing away back
across the park to the distant band of mounted courtiers

to follow also fast but this time careful to keep a
distance behind

He wipes away a tear from her cheek In desperate need of
comfort she throws herself into his arms He holds her

close as she sobs

He strokes her cheek She meets his eyes filled with
gratitude She takes the hand that touches her face and
moves it to her lips She kisses it still holding his

Suddenly theyre kissing eagerly greedily their long pent-
up passion released at last

most unusual this year Mars is
due to take the ascendant three
days after the anniversary of
your birth - your majesty was
born on September 7th - and I see
that twelve days before the
anniversary of your birth -

He transfers his attention to a different astronomical

chart

moon which -

He moves back to the astrological chart

princes of the female gender

I mean to say a prince who is
also a woman

ELIZABETH
Yes Dr Dee I am following you
So what does it all mean

It means the rise of a great
empire majesty And it means
convulsions also The fall of an
empire

Elizabeth listens a faraway look in her eyes

She knows

nothing of the planets but she feels it deep within

herself her moment of destiny is near

ELIZABETH
Which empire is to rise and
which is to fall

as yet more an art than a
science

and

dancing slowly about and crooning a low song in the

Beyond him half-glimpsed an inner room where Bess is

resting on a bed

Now in his solitary dance Raleigh turns and we see hes
holding a new-born BABY BOY He kisses the babys little
bald head and sings his wordless song

Footsteps outside The door opens and a royal servant
enters followed by other servants and guards

OYAL SERVANT
Her majesty the Queen

Elizabeth enters in formal style She stands and takes in

the scene - Raleigh holding his baby son - the room beyond -
Bess rises at once and comes through to make her curtsey to

the Queen Elizabeth seems not to see her
A regal wave at the servants and guards They withdraw

Elizabeth stalks round the room No reason to suppose her
displeasure has passed

ELIZABETH
When was the birth

RALEIGH
F

our nights ago

ELIZABETH
The mother is well

RALEIGH
Thank God

Now Elizabeth turns to Bess and their eyes meet The Queen

puts out her hand and touches Bess lightly on one cheek A

silent forgiveness

Now for the first time she looks at the baby
ELIZABETH

stops

LIZABETH
Id like to give your son my
blessing
RALEIGH

I would be honoured
Elizabeth takes the baby in her arms She holds him
carefully She finds herself more moved than she had
expected She bends her head over him and turns her back
on Raleigh

Raleigh watches and waits And waits

ON ELIZABETH her cheek pressed to the babys head Her
eyes closed

LIZABETH (VO)
I am called the Virgin Queen And
