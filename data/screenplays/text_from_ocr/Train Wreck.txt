decided to go back to Cleveland I
wasn’t totally sure they were gonna
welcome me back But they did They
welcomed me with open arms and an
open heart

inside like up by your cervix It
said if that happens you need to
get it out It says just “bear
down” (Air quotes) and fish it out
So I sat on the toilet and sure
enough it was up there So I made
my finger like a hook (makes finger

it But our dad went to his house
and beat up his dad and his
grandpa and Brandon I’1l bet he
personally offended everyone here
Raise your hand if our dad ever
offended you

Most people raise their hands

Yeah he was an asshole When I
asked him to tell me the story of
how he proposed to our mom his
response was who I know he was
joking He loved her a lot He was
really sick for a really long time
which isn’t fair because I don’t
think anyone else was more alive
than him when he was younger He
thought it was payback He thought
it was karma and that’s why he got
sick But I don’t think so I think
he was the greatest Dad He always
made me feel loved and important I

people from afar because if you
don’t try then you can’t fail

cheerleaders
