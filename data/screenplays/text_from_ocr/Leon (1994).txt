Leon and Mathilda arrive on the roof of a building which
faces Central Park They get close to a wall and maintain this
position Sunlight floods the park

LEON (concentrated)
Firstly you look For more than one
minute Because there are alarm systems
with one minute period Therefore you
wait and look Alarms firstly the sky
for helicopters nearby buildings
Meanwhile you observe soils color and
will try to wear dresses of the same
color Never lighter

Mathilda listens very carefully

LEON
OK Good Now you can assemble your
weapon

He opens the violin case and assembles a rifle with
telescopic sight and silencer

LEON
The rifle is the first weapon you learn
to use because you can keep far from the
client The more experience you have the
closer you get

He finished assembling the weapon and hands it to Mathilda
Shes going to pull off telescopes cover

LEON
No Always take it off at the last
moment because of light reflexes
Theyll see you in two seconds

They get close to roofs edge Mathilda sits down and gets in
position

LEON
Relax You must feel at ease

Mathilda leans down properly

MATHILDA
OK Im fine

LEON
Good
He removes telescopes cover

LEON
Here this is the light scoop for night
shooting There you fix clients
distance How much to the bench down
there in the park

MATHILDA
Huh 500 meters

LEON
130 140

MATHILDA

How can you say it

LEON
Look When you can see his fingers its
50 meters When you just see his hands
its about 80 meters When you
distinguish arms from body its 120-130
When you see nothing more than a shape
you dont shoot Not very sure You have
one chance out of five to miss A
contract means getting all chances on
your side 5 out of 5 You cant miss a
client Never If the task is delicate
or the risk is too big you double That
is you insure yourself by another means

MATHILDA
What for example

LEON
Well if the guy is far in a car and I
know weather is going to be bad rain for
example I think I would plastic the car
with a remote here I shoot from the
distance and if I miss I plastic

MATHILDA
What if you cant approach the car or he

changes car

Leon thinks
LEON
Rocket launcher

MATHILDA
Oh really
(She looks at the
road and imagines)
But can you miss the car

Leon pulls a small box out of the violin

LEON (showing a special bullet)
Its a coded bullet You put it in the
rifle you glue it to the car no matter
where Then you take your rocket
launcher and the rocket will get there
automatically

MATHILDA
Wow Its brilliant

LEON
Yeah Come on have a little
training

Mathilda gets in position

MATHILDA
Wholl I aim at

LEON
Whoever

Leon pulled out binoculars Mathilda looks for a victim by
telescope She passes over playing kids

MATHILDA
No women No kids

Leon smiles she learnt the lesson

LEON
Begin from a steady target Its easier

She stops on a man whos reading a newspaper The man wears
a suit Herald Tribune fat

MATHILDA
The fat man down there on the bench
LEON
Perfect

Mathilda aims at the fat man One of benchs boards explodes
The fat man turns his head He doesnt understand what
happened and resumes reading

LEON
Try again The same

Second shot The bench explodes on the opposite side The
man is still curious but doesnt understand

LEON (at binoculars)
Too much to the left

Mathilda concentrates again and shoots nothing happens
Mathilda wonders whether she missed again and prepares for a
new shot

LEON
Wait

The fat man softly leans down on his side

LEON
Bulls-eye

Mathilda is happy but evidently she expected death to be
more spectacular

LEON
Come on now a walking one

Mathilda aims at a businessman She really chooses the
ugliest one She shoots Mans case explodes and he hides
behind a tree hes scared and doesnt move any more

LEON
Good First shot

MATHILDA
Yeah but I didnt get him I got his
case and now hes behind the tree What
can I do

LEON
Its not serious its just training
You have to learn from the beginning to

hit the target then
precision youll train
cardboards

MATHILDA
OK

LEON
Now try a running guy
Mathilda

MATHILDA
The yellow and pink

LEON
OK

The guy is footing sweaty
Mathilda shoots once Twice

to improve
but on

gets back to telescope and looks for a jogger

with a walkman and headphones
Thrice

The bullets pass around

the jogger who cant see or hear anything
MATHILDA
Shit Its hard when he runs

Leon hands her another charger

LEON
Dont lose him
reload
deeply

your breathe

Concentrate
OK keep calm Calm
Look at his movements
youre running with him Breathe
His movements

There
breathe
Imagine
Hold
Now

She shots and the guy gets a bullet in a thigh Hes scared

but doesnt know where to go

MATHILDA
Did you see First shot

Its good

isnt it Did I learn well

Mathilda proudly smiles

LEON (serious and steady)

Put tools away

Mathilda obeys seriously
Night over city The two are on a small buildings stairway

LEON
Codes

Mathilda gets by his side for her new lesson

LEON
For codes there are two solutions You
have to choose depending on your needs
First case you have time You need the
code for a later time So you wait for
night you get a box with soot powder and
blow a little on the keyboard He does
it and pulls out a screwdriver

LEON
Then you break the little lamp to be
sure the client cant see anything You
wait for someone who gets inside so you
have just to see which numbers he
touched Once you know the four or five
digits you have to try all combinations
once per hour and not more than a minute
to do not get found

LEON (continues)
Second case you have no time but you
mustnt get discovered Screwdriver

He disassembles locks cover
LEON
Here wires need the code Always four

wires

An approximately 40-year-old man climbs the stairway He
evidently lives in the building

MAN
May I
LEON
Pardon
(To Mathilda)
Let pass

Leon opens the door by disassembled locks wires The man is
going to pass but doesnt Leons going to resume his
explanation

MAN
Excuse me but What are you doing

LEON
I teach to the girl

MAN
Do you teach her how to break buildings
doors dont you Dont you give a shit
about me Get away before I call the
Police The man is very nervous
searches in a pocket then pulls out an
anti-aggression bomblet Hell have no
time to use it Leon pulled out his
silenced gun A shot to the hand and the
bomblet takes off Shots energy makes
the man turn around A second shot in the
back makes the man get over the parapet
and disappear in a decorative bush
almost without noise Mathilda is
immobilized Leon looks around then
resumes

LEON
So the wire which starts from the
bottom of the metal part and then you
try the other three wires one by one

At second wire the door opens Leon smiles

She nods

She gets

LEON
Simple isnt it

yes
LEON
Whats up I dont feel youre

concentrated

MATHILDA
Yes yes

close to the parapet and looks at the bush

MATHILDA
Its incredible How did you do it
LEON
What

MATHILDA
There the guy How did you do that
without even touching him Without noise
Its like you put him away How did you
do it

LEON (pause - proud)
Did you like it

She pauses and seriously looks at him

MATHILDA
It was brilliant

Leon and Mathilda at cinema On the screen Fred Astair
breaks out as usual

LEON (talking about Fred Astaire)
Look at his movements Whatever he
says whatever he does he never stops
Sad or happy the movement always goes
on

Pirouette by Fred Astaire

LEON
Look Even the wall nothing stops
him The movement goes on He uses
everything soil wall his rush his
weight Life is movement death is a
part of it

Mathilda listens carefully

LEON
So you have to let the client finish
the movement he started Its better he
thinks about other things and he cant
see deaths arrival Hes got no time to
suffer He isnt surprised Hes got no
time even to think He departs without
realizing He departs in the movement he
started

Mathilda looks at the screen sparkling eyes
MATHILDA
Its brilliant

MATHILDAS OLD BUILDING

Mathilda slowly gets to her floor In front of the door a
thin yellow no entry police strip A cop is distractedly
guarding the hall hes talking with a young black girl
Mathilda gets in her apartment unnoticed She gets in her
room recovers her teddy bear and her Polaroid Then she
gets in the devastated living room Theres dry blood almost
everywhere In the corridor she raises one of parquets
boards A big roll of 100 bills is hidden beneath There is a
small check-book too She carelessly puts everything away
Noise in the apartment Mathilda crouches down Stansfield
gets in together with two more guys Mathilda can see them
without being seen Stansfield is evidently not at ease hes
justifying his actions in front of upper-rank officers

STANSFIELD
So the guy was there hed hidden a
shotgun behind the tent here His woman
was armed too

MAN
Where were the kids during first shots

STANSFIELD
I dont know that was very fast I
didnt see him pulling out his weapon

The man writes some notes The second man observes the
cracked entry door

SECOND MAN

to the door

STANSFIELD (getting nervous)
What are you looking for guys This guy

MAN

The fact youre a public officer doesnt
give you the right to do whatever you
want The narcotic had been following

information about him Your quick lonely
action upset them Its normal they
asked for an inquiry

STANSFIELD
I give a shit about the narcotic
department And if youll go on
searching in this shit youll fall in

Stansfield didnt listen He got out Mathilda slides behind
him She follows him downstairs

IN THE STREET
Stansfield gets on a car and departs Mathilda stops a cab
and gets on board

MATHILDA
May you follow that blue car please
The driver smiles

DRIVER
Do you also want music and skids at
every turn

She hands him 100

MATHILDA
No I want you to drive smoothly get
your 100 and tell me what the last
question was

The driver takes the bill and starts moving He understood
everything

Stansfields car stops in front of a building Mathilda gets
out of the cab and follows Stansfield She gets stopped at
the first check-point in the large hall

COP (amused)
Where are you going little girl

MATHILDA

MATHILDA
He forgot his money My mothers got
a pub behind the corner and he forgot
his money about 100

Mathilda gets away The cop looks at her smiling

i a a a a a a a aS

Mathilda gets back in the hotel room She sits on the couch
in front of the switched off television One has never seen
nor heard her that concentrated and determined Her face
looks thirty-year-old Noise from the lock she switches
television on anime Leon gets in gets off his stuff Hes
got a parcel He puts it on the table Leon is stunned by her
lack of interest for the parcel

LEON
Â»Its for you Its a gift

No reactions No replies

LEON
Would you like me to open it
(Hes too excited)
Il open it
(He pulls out a
small dress flowers
motif Hes very
happy)
Do you like it

MATHILDA (harsh)
Youd better directly buy the doll to
fit in it that would be clearer Leon
doesnt understand He takes the dress
and checks it out for defects

She sighs and gets in the kitchen Leon gives up He sweetly
lays the dress down on the table and switches television off
Mathilda comes back with a lot of pop corn She switches
television on again sits on the couch and turns volume up
Leon is perplexed he doesnt speak He gets in the bathroom
for a shower Mathilda turns volume down She stands up
glances at the dress touches it by fingertips Her face is
tense Water flows in the bathroom but Leon is at doors
small opening and observes Mathilda She eventually leaves the
dress switches television off and gets to the window to look
at the sunset Leon feels bad He silently closes the door

i a a a a a a a aS

Mathilda sits in front of him like in an arena

MATHILDA (cold)
Im sick of this Leon

LEON
Â»You can leave whenever you want I
dont refrain you

MATHILDA
This is what I dont like you see
you dont refrain me but at the same
time I cant get out

Leon is still cleaning his weapons

LEON
Do you think you learnt patience today

MATHILDA (getting nervous)
Well Im a poor pupil about patience
OK

Leon slightly smiles

LEON
You stayed home not bad A good
start

She smiles at him and he returns

MATHILDA
Ive been out all the time stupid

Leons smile disappears
MATHILDA
I got home to get my stuff

She pulls out some dollars and puts them on the desk

MATHILDA
Here Not 8000 Theyre 6800 I hope you
will credit me for the missing 1200
Furthermore Im going to make your work
easier the guy is Norman Stansfield
Office 2702 at FBI 5th Avenue 68th
Street

Leon is pale Open mouth

LEON
And How do you know all this

MATHILDA (as if its evident)
The above Norman was in my home when I
was there and I followed him thats
all

Leon tries to keep calm

LEON
Are you calmly telling me you spent the
day at FBI

She shrugs her shoulders

MATHILDA
No I cant come in I remained
outside And why do you mind this
Youve got clients name moneys on the
table its a good contract isnt it

Leon looks at her then looks at the money

LEON
Not taken

MATHILDA
Why

LEON

Too heavy

Mathilda thinks fast
MATHILDA
Well Then may you rent me your gear
for the day

LEON
I never rent my gear

Blocked on every front she sweetly starts crying

Leon intensely look at her neither severe nor badly

MATHILDA
Why are you doing this to me Leon Why
dont you take me with you for contracts
If you teach me well can do mine
together That would be good wouldnt
it

cold like an iceberg

Mathilda

Mathilda

LEON
Mathilda nothing is the same after you
kill someone Your life changes forever
Youll can never cancel it neither from
your memory nor from your criminal
record Youll never sleep again like
before Mathilda

Just

dries up her tears Shes abandoned exhausted

MATHILDA
If you knew Leon I killed one
thousand in my head And this never

disturbed my sleep

LEON

OK And if its you who gets killed

(Mathilda doesnt

reply)
Then Talking about other peoples
death is easy but what about yours
Shes here She moves around you and
can get you in a thousandth of second
Because it was your day your hour your
second

looks at him Leon gets confused

LEON (cont)
Its written in the sky from the
beginning just you dont know Then
someone announces you like this
Suddenly Did you ask yourself what time
you will die Well its now And its
too late already youve got a bullet in
your lungs already There

He pushes her by his index finger enough to hurt her

LEON
Painful isnt it
(He pushes again)
You dont like talking about death
because youre like everyone you fear
it

LEON
Well its this fear that makes you
live Its because you fear death that
you live with so much tenacity Its
because of it that you bear whats
unbearable You can live in a hovel on
lots of trash everything is better than
death and the fear you have of it

(Pause)
But me Leon I dont fear it any
more They look at each other for a
moment It takes a long to lose it this
fear but once you lost it You are
free And just then you can start
working properly Because you can work

on other peoples fear play with it
Because kill or get killed have become
just words Do you understand

Mathilda slightly nods yes

LEON
Â»You cant pretend to make this job
until you get beyond this stage The day
you get free of this fear Not
before

Mathilda looks at his eyes without challenge

MATHILDA
Leon I have no fear Its so
Leon stares at her He tries to ascertain truth in Mathildas
eyes A long pause

LEON
OK

He takes a weapon empties the cylinder then loads just one
bullet

LEON (cont)
Do you know this game

Mathilda nods yes He turns the cylinder

LEON
One shot ahead I start

He gets the barrel to his temple so that if the bullet
explodes blood will get out with a downward angle Hes ready

He pulls the trigger Nothing happens He puts the gun in
front of her

Mathilda takes it She looks at him with so much love he
almost gets upset

Shes not scared Shed just like things to be different
maybe shed like Leon to open his heart to her She sighs
looks at the gun She takes it lifts the cock and aims the
weapon at her face Shes resigned

MATHILDA

Love or death
She gets the barrel in her mouth and looks at Leon A tear
drop on Leons front She pulls the trigger Nothing She
puts down the gun Leon stands up turns around the table and
embraces her He holds her tight Shes surprised She kindly
pushes Leon back to look at his eyes

MATHILDA
Am I ready

Leon pauses Slightly smiles and nods yes Mathilda closes

her eyes happy and relieved She takes his hand and embraces
him for a long Leon lets her do

i a a a a a a a aS

door Leon catches mans throat

LEON

The man obeys Leon puts the silencer in his mouth

The man sweaty nods yes Leon checks out the apartment and
the man follows him like his shadow Leon moves without paying

to do not let the gun out of his mouth In the living room on
the desk syringes and the stuff for them Leon finished

Mathilda approaches the man and shoots again Maybe too low
a squirt of blood on her dresses

LEON
Here it is Look at your dresses now
How can you walk in the street now

He recovers his gun

LEON (cont)
Not a good work this When you shoot
from this angle you always get blood
everywhere You have to move aside and
shoot with a little more angle
There This way

He shoots It makes no difference to the man
LEON (cont)
Â»Can you see Look not a drop Come

He gives her the gun again Mathilda moves on a side and
shoots Perfect

gratitude maybe a compliment but Leon is hermetic

LEON

without moving She doesnt dare passing before the open door
again to join Leon In the living room Leon still thinks

LEON
Why didnt he close the window

He looks around and sees mans overcoat still wet His wet
shoes are on the radiator

LEON
Because he didnt get out

Leon stands up pulls out his gun and runs toward the
corridor Mathilda against the wall looks up to make him
understand its not too soon

bath the walkman Leon pulls out his personal periscope and
looks into the bathroom The man is still there music at full
blast Leon puts away his periscope

LEON

He silently gets in the bathroom followed by Mathilda They
sit down and look at the man sleeping in the mid of his warm
bath Leon pulls out his silencer and screws it on the gun

MATHILDA

Mathildas walkman is on He hesitates then eventually puts
on the headphones Its a sweet almost classical music Very
beautiful like the arriving Mathilda She wears the dress

she hands to Leon She lowers the tents to dim the strong
sunlight Mathilda heels down in front of him Leon doesnt
dare move any more
MATHILDA
-Dont you drink

LEON
I prefer waiting for a while I feel
it would go the wrong way

Mathilda takes the glass from his hands and drinks half She
passes her tongue along her lips to dry up the milk Leon
looks at her like a child in front of a sweet shop She
returns his milk Mathilda looks like a calm cat

MATHILDA (sweetly)
I love you Leon Totally Its the
first time I feel it that strong Its

She caresses his hand

MATHILDA (cont)

Leon retracts his hand and finishes the milk

He looks at Mathilda with as much sadness as happiness By a
fingertip Mathilda takes the milkdrop on Leons lips and gets
it in her mouth Leon is going to cry

LEON (feeling bad)
-l cant Mathilda I cant

MATHILDA (with a sad smile)
-Have you got a girlfriend

-Youre the most beautiful Mathilda
Mathilda looks relieved by these magic words She puts her
face on Leons lap who caresses her hair

MATHILDA
You know girls think about their first
boyfriend for a long time I imagined
him with grizzled hair elegant A
little like Georgias father Georgia is
a classmate of mine Kinda guy makes
you feel sure Cool isnt it Leon nods
yes without really knowing what hes
saying yes to My mates told me the
first time they made love was awful
They had pain everywhere afterward
But thats because they made it with men
they didnt love In fact they did it
just to show off at the beginning
Later they liked it Like
cigarettes

Leon closes his eyes Kind of pain on his face

MATHILDA
How many girlfriends did you have

LEON
I dont know
MATHILDA

kids Her father didnt want her to
meet me My family was not very
respectable

MATHILDA

Leon pauses for a long then nods yes

Mathilda

LEON
-He killed her a bullet in her
head

is stunned

MATHILDA

that asshole

LEON
-Yes The day he got out of jail I
allowed him to make ten steps No more

And bang Two hundred meters By
telescope That night I left my country
and came here to join my father who
worked for Tony I was 17 Then I
never left the city And never had
another girlfriend

Leon sweetly looks at her
LEON (cont)

Mathilda

MATHILDA

just know I love you And love is

stronger than anything else
Leon is more and more nervous like a child

LEON

Leon cries Mathilda caresses his face

MATHILDA

She caresses his chest

MATHILDA (cont)

me The first to make love with me
Nobody before you

She stands up and modestly gets off her briefs without taking
off her dress Leon cries unable to oppose her Mathilda is
too young but shes also too beautiful and lovely and sweet
and tender She sweetly very sweetly gets on him

LEON (crying)
Why me Mathilda why me

Mathilda leans over to speak in his ear

MATHILDA
Because you deserve it Leon

Leon embraces her Hes full of happiness shame so many

emotions he cant control very well But hell how
beautiful it is seeing them sweetly making love

i a a a a a a a aS
MORNING

A beautiful morning like one wishes everyone to be Leon in
the bed Its the first time one sees him in a bed and
furthermore he sleeps By his side on a small table a gun
You never know On the other side Mathilda looks at him
smiling because hes almost nice while he sleeps She starts
moving to stand up Leon abruptly wakes up His hand reaches
for the gun He sees Mathilda and the room Mathilda puts a
hand on his chest and kindly forces him to lay down

MATHILDA
Did you sleep well

LEON
I never really sleep

Mathilda smiles

MATHILDA
Huh yes I forgot -When you fake
sleeping youd better not snore

LEON (trapped)

MATHILDA

s arms and learns how to exploit a bed

kK kK kK kK kK

The man is member of a SWAT team bullet-proof jacket

Theyre seven

shyly

lift
THE BOSS (low voice)
From now you dont make a noise and
reply by nodding yes or shaking your head

Mathilda nods yes She learns quickly

THE BOSS
Is he alone

Yes from Mathilda

THE BOSS
Does he expect you

Yes from Mathilda

THE BOSS
Have you got apartments keys

Yes from Mathilda She hands him the keys

THE BOSS
Is there a code a way to knock the door
or something

Yes from Mathilda

She approaches her hand to the wall two knocks three
knocks two knocks Wrong code

The boss is satisfied anyway He signs the group they get in
position Mathilda in a corner a man remains with her

MAN
Dont fear

MATHILDA
I have no fear

The first three cops are in position The leader is nervous
Everyone is ready He knocks the code on the door Reply
isnt late Inside a classical music starts Cops get in one
by one commando style From the corridor one clearly sees
apartments open door and one clearly sees also the hand
above the door that sweetly closes

In the corridor the other cops have no time They hear the
slaughter in progress shouts and shots for twenty seconds
Then door opens again Three corpses in the apartments
corridor The man with Mathilda uses his walkie-talkie

MAN
Shit We need reinforcements Maximum
Come on

Mathilda puts a hand in her parcel and pulls out a gun she
keeps along her body On doors side a small reflex Its
Leons periscope checking the other three cops progression

Two of them progress behind armored shields Suddenly
Leons voice breaks the silence

LEON (shouting)
Mathilda Now

Leon appears from nowhere and empties his kalashnikov in the
corridor The three cops dont shoot for a long Mathilda
lifts her arm kills the cop at lower landing and aims at the
cop who kept her

LEON (loud)
Mathilda

She appears in the corridor her hostage before her still
her milk with her Leon is relieved

LEON
Dont expose your back Turn

Mathilda obeys and walks backward

She needs her hostage for protection and he remains in front
of her Leon covers her from the apartment

A group of cops a dozen gets upstairs Leon breaks the
fire equipment niches glass unrolls the pipe in the
corridor throws the axe into the apartment and opens the
water at full pressure The pipe twists and beats all around
the corridor

Leon shoots Reply is immediate Fortunately Mathilda is
behind her hostage his bullet-proof jacket is insufficient
Leon and Mathilda get back in the apartment and close the
door leaving the hostage crucified on it

Mathilda is nervous Leon is concentrated
MATHILDA
Why did you unleash the pipe I dont
know

LEON
It will take them five minutes How
long ago did they arrive

MATHILDA
I dont know Five minutes

LEON
Good Snipers cant be in position

Leon gets close to the wall and gets rid of the tents
allowing light to explode

Window explodes too they shoot like never before

LEON
Ten minutes at least Not five

In the corridor cops eventually catch the pressurized pipe
and close the water On all fours Leon and Mathilda get in
the kitchen He gets the axe and the violin case by the way
Mathilda is more and more nervous Leon is more and more
concentrated

MATHILDA
How shall we get out now Leon

LEON
Let me work Well get out I tell you

He shoots at the dustbin duct and makes it explode He
enlarges the hole by axe Leon throws in the duct his
overcoat his sacks content and his violin (grenades
weapons etc) Mathilda then throws in her teddy bear and
Polaroid

In the corridor sand bags are becoming a wall armored
shields and cops multiply A cop gets in position with a

rocket-launcher and shoots The door explodes and smoke floods

the interior

Leon helps Mathilda to get into the duct Shes half in when
she seems to realize something
Mathilda

MATHILDA
But Leon Youll never get in it
Its nearly too small for me

LEON (smiling)
I know my love

starts crying

MATHILDA
No I dont want to leave you

LEON
Mathilda listen

MATHILDA
No no I dont want to go I dont
want

He rudely takes her face in his hands

He kisses all over her face

LEON
Listen to me shit Weve got no chance
to get out together Alone I will get
out Trust me Im in perfect shape
Mathilda now I slept well I love you
Im happy And I thought Ill get all
the money Tony keeps for me and well
leave OK Together Well leave
tomorrow

MATHILDA
You say it just to calm me

LEON
Not at all Mathilda I tell you because
its true Youll buy the globe you told
me about and you will choose OK Well
go where you want I swear youll see
Mathilda

LEON
Come on go Dont let them find you I
finish this work and we meet at Tonys

Mathilda is a little confused
OK Spread your arms to do not fall too
fast So good At Tonys One hour or
two OK I love you Mathilda

He kisses her again

MATHILDA
I love you too my darling

He pushes her She disappears in the duct

Leon pushes his back against the hall and dries up his tears
He shouts terrifyingly In the corridor three first line
cops progress with gas masks they decide to get in through
the destroyed door

Mathilda gets in the trash bin She carefully looks out
nobody around She gets out and recovers some weapons

APARTMENT
A wounded cop mask on his face gets out of the apartment
and out of the smoke cloud

Hes therefore protected and taken over
by another cop He accompanies him a
little farther

A BOSS
Get downstairs guy get down

He slaps him on his shoulder The wounded cop obeys and gets
to the lower floor Hes someway surprised when he realizes
the stairs are literally full of cops everywhere

The wounded cop passes by his colleagues and gets down Cops
everywhere sandbags It looks like a trench warfare He
didnt yet pull his mask off One makes him sit on a bench
and starts pulling off his mask A doctor comes in and checks
out cops arm He pulls off his mask Its Leon

DOCTOR
Its deep Youd better get down to the
ambulance theyll care you properly A

cop chief doesnt recognize Leon

CHIEF
3rd district A mess up there isnt
it
Leon nods yes
DOCTOR
Let him breathe five minutes
(to Leon)

Would you like me to take you down

Leon shakes his head no

LEON
Let me put my mask on I breathe better
with it

DOCTOR

Yeah right Get down and wait for ten
minutes Ill get to check you OK

LEON
OK

The chief gets away Everything seems to work properly
Theres just one thing Leon didnt notice its STANSFIELDs
right hand climbing upstairs who identifies him and gets
back down Mathilda got out

She observes from a corner the movements in the street
Police cars and ambulances all around

IN THE APARTMENT

A cops checking out the apartment he pushes kitchens door
and a grenade falls to his feet The explosion shakes the
whole corridor Cops crowd it Below Leon exploits the
moment to stand up and discreetly walk downstairs Floor after
floor without problems

SLOW MOTION

Behind him unheard and unseen STANSFIELD follows him
STANSFIELD rises his arm A gun at hand The gun aims at
LEONS back of the neck

Leon advances and can see just the light filled exit synonym
of freedom But his vision gradually gets paler and the image
tilts without noise The image is now completely inclined
and gets paler and paler Overexposed image then suddenly
BLACK

Leons died Without even realizing it Mathilda is still
observing Stansfields right hand gets out of the building
and lifts an arm to the sky He wants everyones attention

RIGHT HAND
Its alright We got him Its over

Some cops clap others whistle Mathilda leans on the wall
and cries Stansfield is in the corridor near Leon officers
are congratulating him

CHIEF
Shit Never seen anything like this
before

ANOTHER

He almost fucked me furthermore

STANSFIELD

He killed Richmond my boss two days
ago And Rinaldi too Weve been on
him for months

A chief slaps on his shoulder but hes embittered he lost
many men too

CHIEF
Nice shot

SLOW MOTION

Mathilda appears She wears Leons large overcoat A silenced
gun at hand Her face is harsh and immobile like never before
In front of buildings entry two cops look at her stunned
This will be their last expression

She gets in the corridor At the end STANSFIELD laughs
together with his colleagues Mathilda advances until the
white sheet on the ground She crouches down lifts one end
Leons got blood everywhere but his expression is sweet and
relaxed Mathilda caresses his cheeks

A man tips on STANSFIELDs back The group turns and sees the
little girl crouched near the corpse Mathilda kisses Leons

mouth and stands up She leaves her gun on the floor

She looks at STANSFIELD straight in his eyes with a big
smile STANSFIELD doesnt understand Mathilda pulls her hand
out of a pocket and launches something to him STANSFIELD
catches the object Its a metal ring STANSFIELD understands
lesser and lesser

Mathilda opens her overcoat inside a dozen of grenades
everywhere One lacks its ring

STANSFIELD UNDERSTANDS EVERYTHING
COMPLETE GENERAL ABSOLUTE EXPLOSION
The shockwave shakes everyone in the street Still in slow

motion thousands of debris fall on the street A rain which
is even sadder than usual

THE END
