100 years to go from the
Industrial Revolution to
putting a man in space It
took us only another 100 to

we didnt go out and find
somewhere else to live we
realized we were gonna die

and join hundreds of journalists in the
audience Lights dim In front face lit from
below at a podium Senior Scientist HAROLD
ERNEST 60s head of the Space Exploration
Office
ERNEST
As many of you may know in
2032 the Space Exploration
Office began a series of
unmanned flights to Mars
The entire wall behind him 40 feet by 100
feet is a vid screen As he speaks the images
appear Not as if hes narrating to the
footage but as if its voice activated
ERNEST
It had been determined by
2020 that Mars harbored no
life Although beginning
with the same resources as
Earth four billion years
ago Mars didnt support
any life beyond the
microbial stage in the last
300 million years Nor did
it have an atmosphere or
climate supportive of human
life
Exactly as he describes it it occurs
(Icecaps melt temperature gradients rise
etc) In the audience are hundreds of
journalists watching
ERNEST
It was however concluded
that Mars was receptive to
terraforming If we could
raise the temperature of
the planet by only four
degrees the resultant
melting of the ice caps
would increase the density
of the atmosphere thus
holding greater heat
melting the icecaps
further We could use the
greenhouse effect to our
benefit To do this we
needed to increase the
oxygen content of the
atmosphere Resultingly a
series of probes were sent
each releasing further and
further genetically
manipulated lichen and
algaes designed to stand
the rigors of the Martian
environment while
augmenting the oxygen
content of the Martian
atmosphere In the last 28
years we have sent 2200
probes The terraforming
was initially successful
We see the probes launching and bursting in
aerosol deployments over the Martian surface
Algae blooms Red orange green black burnt
sienna Every color you can imagine Valleys
covered with color
ERNEST
The average temperature on
Mars has increased two and
a half degrees over the
last three decades The
oxygen content began to
increase as well And then
eleven months ago the 02
The color

on Mars suddenly began to
decline Soon after all
the remote sensors on the
planet ceased functioning
We have no idea whats gone
wrong We need to know why
Mans very destiny may lie
in the answer
on Mars ebbs away

ERNEST
We are about to embark on
the greatest mission of
human exploration By using
a number of Heavy Lift
Launch Vehicles anda
modified close lunar cargo
ship we have created a
vessel capable of
journeying to Mars

We see construction being rushed along and
Hab-1 (a kind of big space RV) landing and

deploying

on Mars as —

ERNEST
Three months ago Hab-1 an
unmanned living
environment was launched
In nine days Ares-1 our
first manned mission will
be sent to Mars Ladies and
gentlemen I give you the
first men and women to
travel beyond the reach of
Earth to the next planet in
the solar system

Light comes up on the crew

ERNEST

She will be assisted by
Pilot and Mission
Specialist Ed Santen

And were pleased to have
Dr Bud Chantilas come out
of retirement as our Chief
Science Officer Bud brings
a view as a generalist few
can offer with a Nobel in
chemistry and a MacGregor
in molecular biology He
was off getting another
PhD this time in

theology when we asked
him to join us

Dr Chip Pettengill who
until recently has held the
number two position in the
Terraforming Office is an
expert in extremophile and
cryptoendolithic biology
(then)
Dr Cooper Burchenal late
of Western BioTech has left
the private sector to help

(last)
And we are also joined by
Robert Gallagher
Santen turns to Kate and quietly mutters
SANTEN
The janitor
His MIKE was on It ECHOES across the room
But Gallaghers too quick to let him try to
apologize anyhow

GALLAGHER
Thats technically space
janitor
Crowd likes this Gallagher continues -
GALLAGHER

When the toilet breaks 80
million miles from the
nearest hardware store
they call me Actually
they called me now cause
then would be too late
ERNEST
To be more precise Mr
Gallagher is the Mechanical
Systems Engineer Were
glad to have him along
Ernest moves on quickly
ERNEST
We stand on the threshold
of the most triumphant
moment of the millennium
Science has brought us
here and science will take
us further

The MEV is horrendously battered Its a
wonder theyre alive Chantilas is propped
against a rock moving a device the size of a
hardback book across his abdomen Its a kind
of combination x-raysonogram Doesnt like
what he sees Puts it aside for the moment
without discussing it with the others
Gallagher emerges from the MEV dragging some
tools and other salvaged gear (NOTE All
communication is via the VOX radios in their

spacesuits)
CHANTILAS
Whatve we got
GALLAGHER

The radios dead Rovers
dead AMEEs dead You gave
me a shop and three months
and I could get this thing
set for orbital re-entry
Otherwiseits staying
here

Santens climbed to the top of a nearby
outcropping of rock Surveys the area

That puts

BURCHENAL
Anything

SANTEN
No

PETTENGILL

Great We put up with your
shit for three hundred
million miles so you could
crash-land us on Mars Just
fucking great
BURCHENAL
By all rights son we
should be dead That was a
decent piece of flying
SANTEN
We have a mission to
accomplish people
PETTENGILL
Well be dead in eight
hours anyhow when the air
runs out Cause megapilot
missed the landing site
There is no more fucking
mission
it all into perspective
GALLAGHER
So where the hell are we
SANTEN
The GPS was tied to the
radioswhich are dead
Transponder on the Hab was
tied to the nav computer
GALLAGHER
which is dead Didnt
the boys at NASA pack us a
compass
BURCHENAL
Theres no magnetic core on
Mars Wouldnt do any good
Gallagher considers all this for a moment

GALLAGHER
I dont think I like this
planet

CHANTILAS

Best guess Where do you
think we are
Santen shrugs As much as you can shrug ina

SANTEN
Somewhere downrange
Santen pulls his HHC out of a pocket on his
thigh 2050 descendant of a laptop Mutters at
it It whizzes past all Hab info
schematics the standard
360 degree pan from the
landing site topo map of
Mars Zooms in to show
where the Hab was deployed
SANTEN
Based on the last
uncorrupted nav state and
given that we were ina
full manual descent with no
computer correction Id
sayin this 60x120 mile
ellipse
Okay Thats big Theres a long moment of
resignation Its a little irrational but
then re the HHC -
BURCHENAL
Weve got every other
mission variable in here
we ought to be able to
figure aerobrake friction
and the speed and orbit of
the Ares when we exited We
should be able to close in
on the downrange variables
Tighten up the ellipse
Its about the math
Gallagher cant believe it
GALLAGHER
This is it This is that
moment they told us about
in high school Where one
day again wed use algebra
And it would save our
lives And I thought they
were fucking kidding
Gallagher turns in frustration and walks away
Chantilas calls to him -
CHANTILAS
Stay in range A thousand
yards And your radios
line of sight
GALLAGHER
Right I wouldnt want to
get lost
He continues to wander off We can hear them
discussing drag coefficients and whatnot It
just makes him ill
Gallagher stares out at the Martian plain It
would be kinda cool Except for the fact hes
gonna die here Hes pissed and frightened
Yanks his HHC out Mutters images appear All
the Hab details Stares at the map and then
the 360 degree panorama Back at the map Back
at the panorama Something about it strikes
him Looks at it some more He gets up looks
around Looks around some more Heads back to
the guys
GALLAGHER
I dont think its about
math I dont like math so
Im biased I think its
about the picture
He holds out the picture of the panorama
Santen dismisses him - hes not a scientist
hes not a pilot he should leave them alone
SANTEN
Were not in that picture
If we were wed know where
the Hab was Were trying
to figure this out
Robby ignores him tosses a rock in the sand
wraps the the 360 degree panorama around it
Screen bends and turns translucent as he does
GALLAGHER
Look say thats the
lander At about 30 degrees
in the distance it sees
this mountain with the
funny top And at about 180
degrees it sees this funny
set of twin peaks (points)
Now I see this mountain
over there And these peaks
over there behind me almost
on a straight line And
then theres this other
peak maybe which would put
us on the line say here
Which leaves the angle to
the Hab at about there
Santen and Chantilas start to manipulate their
HHCs faster than you can follow Muttering to
them hand-gesturing cross-referencing back
and forth to the map as the ellipse shrinks
and their landing location isdetermined
BURCHENAL
Space Janitor First Class
Gallagher nicely done
SANTEN
The good news is its an

GALLAGHER
Theres bad news

How are we after launch
Id like to run a systems
check (as she nods)
Shall we do the hokey-
pokey Just to satisfy me
She rapidly shakes each of her legs in turn
Gallagher flips on a wrist panel display
Built into the fabric of his suit He sees
what AMEE sees

BOWMAN

Whyd you come Gallagher
Not expecting this one Takes a sec -
GALLAGHER
I did two years as a
mechanic at NASCAR A year
and a half at McMurdo in
the South Pole Three years
on subs I had the highest
military tech ratings you
can get And I went cross-
country once with my
cousins in a motor home
This didnt seem so bad
BOWMAN
Thats why they called
Whyd you come
A beat then -
GALLAGHER
You ever been to Europe
Europes horrible Its
full of stodgy people whose
ancestors didnt have the
balls to go to America and
try something new Earth is
gonna be like Europe You
might visit there and
admire some old buildings
and crap but you wouldnt
want to live there This
was like getting a call to
go with Columbus to America
the first time But harder
How could you not go
Damn Burchenal grins
BURCHENAL
I dont like Europe much
either son Didnt quite
figure it the same way but
damnation you dont turn
down a phone call like
that do ya
(to Kate)
You
BOWMAN
I spent my entire life
training to fly the
biggest fastest thing you
can fly This is it Its
the best job in the world
(points to Santen)
Hes going cause he got
the second best job in
space Hes a little pissed
about it but he still
came
Shes nailed him so precisely Santen can only
wince and look away Pettengill just pipes up
Maybe no ones gonna ask and he wants to get
it out in the open -
PETTENGILL
I was never supposed to
come I came cause my boss
couldnt He failed the
medical Heart arrhythmia
So here I am They tapped
me on the shoulder told me
I was going to Mars I was
supposed to be second in
charge of the Terraforming
office till I died

uncomfortable Certainly out of his element A
little well puny

PETTENGILL
Sorequired exercise
Havent had this since
grade school
SANTEN
Yeah you musta been doing
some kind of reverse thing
where you get small
Santens got years in the gym Muscles on
muscles Bowman takes a two-second evaluation
of the situation

BOWMAN
Youre done You can
shower

SANTEN
Im not done I was
gonna

BOWMAN

No Youre done
Santen cant believe hes being thrown out
But hes also a product of the military and
couldnt argue if he tried
SANTEN
Yes maam
He leaves Pettengill feels stupid
PETTENGILL
You didnt have to do that
BOWMAN
No I did If I didnt nip
that in the bud I wouldnt
be doing my job
(then)
Flying this beast is only
half the job The whole
jobs to get the crew in
place in shape to do what
they have to do And the
funny thing is flyings
the easy part
Pettengill stands abashed for a moment and
then his resentment just bubbles out
PETTENGILL
I just hate all those
fucking guys I feel like
Ive spent my entire life
being the guy who was
hassled in phys ed I lost
the first girl I ever cared
about to some thug who
could throw a football
farther than I could Its
like women are hardwired to
think that guys who are
proficient at sports are
going to be better
providers Its not like we

hunt and kill our own food
anymore
(then)
He sells cars for a living
now Cars I end up working
on a project that may save
the existence of mankind

This is impressively obsessive
BOWMAN
You kept track of him What
happened to her
(off his look of
who)
The girl
He has no idea She grins at him -
BOWMAN
Little competitive Whos
hardwired for what Cro-
Magnon guy
He cant help it he grins a little abashed
BOWMAN
Were gonna start with the
bungees Try to quit being
pissed off you werent
chosen for dodgeball
willya
PETTENGILL
Ill try Twenty years of
hating the bullying
motherfuckers is a hard
habit to break
END OF FLASHBACK
EXT CRASH SITE (MARS) - DAY
Its quiet And then a slight METALLIC SOUND
We PUSH TOWARDS the MEV and IN AMEE lies on
the deck beside her storage container A leg
twitches Then another Servo WHINE Gets
gingerly to her feet Eyes turn Wriggles once
as if she was stiff and cautiously makes her
way outside
EXT CRASH SITE (MARS) - DAY
Looks around Analyzes Turns and heads off
into the landscape
EXT MARTIAN PLAIN - DAY
A landscape so huge its hard to comprehend
Five tiny figures progress across the bottom
of the frame Theyve already come a long
ways Beginning to string out Pause and
regather Pettengill stops to catch his
breath
GALLAGHER
How you doing
PETTENGILL
Little tired Im okay
SANTEN
You should have put more
treadmill time in

PETTENGILL
(sotto)

Go fuck yourself

SANTEN

Whatd you say

PETTENGILL

AhhhMusclehead go fuck
yourself
Theyre both getting louder and louder

BURCHENAL

Guys
Burchenal reaches out checks their wrist

monitors

BURCHENAL

Were doing fine In point
of fact hes using less 02
than you are We can stop a
minute Unless you two want
to shout at each other and
use up your air

PETTENGILL

Sorry

SANTEN

Fine Im sorry too
No ones sorry They rest Use the moment to

look around

Its pretty astounding Chantilas

uses the respite to re-scan his abdomen Puts
the device away again Hes in pain but
refuses to acknowledge it

GALLAGHER

How you doing

CHANTILAS

Things are as they are

(then)

Lord Look at it were on
Mars Pretty damn amazing

PETTENGILL
It weird Theres nothing
here

GALLAGHER
Its Mars

PETTENGILL
No I mean theres not even

a trace of the algae
He kneels down examines a rock Nada

PETTENGILL

Even if it all died
thered be something - a
dried algal mat traces on
the lee sides something
Nothing Nada

BURCHENAL

Hes right We sent up
fifty-two varietals Blue-
green black orange
Anhydriobiosics
chemotrauphs even a
thibacillus that could grow
autotrophically on
elemental sulfur Not only
are they dead theyre all
just gone I dont get it
Its like they were scoured
off the rock
GALLAGHER
Maybe there was never
anything in this valley
As they walk Burchenal checks his HCC
BURCHENAL
If we are where we think we
are -
Map appears on a small screen he mutters to
it overlays of all the algae and lichen that
were on Mars appear
BURCHENAL
This valley was covered
with blue algae a month
ago Valley back one should
have been covered in an
orange-red chloroflectic
Hes right Its weird
There should be something
They crest a small rise Below lies a valley
that closes down quickly into an extremely
narrow canyon Burchenal and Santen check
their HHC maps
BURCHENAL
This however makes sense
SANTEN
Debris apron Delineated
valley fill Depositional
fan
He double-checks with Chantilas Seems theyre
going the right way Chantilas leans back
heavily against a rock
CHANTILAS
Good You gotta keep
moving
Chantilas doesnt get up
GALLAGHER
And whatre you gonna do
sit here and watch You
getting old and lazy
CHANTILAS
My spleens ruptured
Theres significant
internal bleeding Im not
going any further And
trying to carry me will
slow you down just enough
that we can all die
Robbys stunned frantic
GALLAGHER
Well get you to the Hab
Lock out the spine impulse
and you can walk one of us
through it

CHANTILAS
No You wont

Santen takes charge Its his mission now

go Lieutenant Now
(turns to Robby)
Ive only got about forty
minutes Theres really not
much pain Put me around
the corner where Ive got a
view

ey lift him to the other side of the rock
allagher stays with Chantilas a moment

speechless Inside Gallaghers

elmet we can see as the tears roll down

CHANTILAS
Its okay Im not sorry I
came

We are already PULLING BACK BACK

WIDE WIDE WIDE and
EXT HILLSIDE (MARS) - DAY
The four of them trudge up a long hill The
summit is a dozen steps away Santen is the
first to reach it He looks out over the
horizon Turns back to the others -
SANTEN
Youre gonna like this
HIS POV
We see what he sees as do the others as they
arrive - not that far in the distance in the
valley below they can see the lab shining in
the sun
BACK TO SCENE
BURCHENAL
Twenty-six months of food
water and air gentlemen
PETTENGILL
Were saved
ey run down the hillside For the first time
e get a feeling for the 38 gravity Bouncing
ixteen foot steps Like little kids as they
ome bounding down

ey keep running and leaping and coming
ntil the first one begins to slow Its not
rom exhaustion And then the second and the

What the fuck happened
here

HAHTHQAHAMGHwmaANEH

PETTENGILL
Jesus
Burchenal continues to look around for a
moment It doesnt matter what happened Its
over Shakes his head at Gallagher
BURCHENAL
Hows your air
GALLAGHER
(checks)
Twenty-two minutes
BURCHENAL
Im not much better
SANTEN
What the fuck
He kicks angrily at whats left of the
structure Storms off It takes Pettengill a
moment to process it but
PETTENGILL
Were all gonna die arent
we
INT ARES - MAINTENANCE LEVEL - NIGHT
Pitch black except for the electroluminescent
panels shes stuck around the room She cracks
another one on They work like glowsticks but
the size of menus

Shes jumpered the circuits Multimeters
Velcroed all over the place Trying to reboot
the entire ship Checks her loads balances
one more jumper throws a breaker The SHIP
GROANS FLICKERS TO LIFE DIES She checks a
meter changes a jumper tries again This
time the SHIP GROANS FLICKERS TO LIFE and
STAYS ON-line The systems begin to come alive
around her Panels light up turn from red to
green Lights start to come on Gravity
returns

INT ARES - VARIOUS SPHERES - NIGHT

Bowman moves through The place is a mess
Soot and fire stains in some spheres Smoke
damage in all Flowers destroyed The garden
is half-wrecked She manually opens a set of
valves in one room AIR HISSES in from an
emergency supply She checks a meter in her
hand checks again to be sure Folds back the
helmet of her suit Breathes

INT ARES - FLIGHT DECK - NIGHT

Bowman tries to bring the rest of the ship
back to life Half a dozen systems are just
plain dead and have to be locked out Things
are not good Lights beginning to come up
Moments away from entering front-side orbit
Kate opens a panel marked OBS and throws a
series of switches

EXT ARES - NIGHT

Door slides open A small optical receiver is
seen They clear the dark side and burst into
the light

INT ARES - FLIGHT DECK - NIGHT

On a large viewscreen Bowman can now scan the
surface to about a one meter resolution
Searches Starts wide scanning the edge of
the horizon as it comes into view

Picks up the glint of the MEV Zooms in At
first theres nothing but the crashed MEV in
profile (Like a spy satellite we are an an
EXTREME ANGLE SLOWLY REVEALING more as the
Ares grows less oblique and tracks overhead)
Then the severity of the damage comes clear
Bowman tries not to react Nothing else is
there No sign of activity or escape The
footprints are beyond the resolution of the
camera Theres no reason to believe anything
but theyre all dead

EXT HAB and ENVIRONS (MARS) - DAY

Gallagher and Burchenal sit on rocks nearby
Not exerting themselves Checking their
monitors

BURCHENAL
Maybe we got what we
deserved We ignored
science and truth on one
planet and poisoned it
beyond repair Then tried
to get science to save us
on another Maybe its the
inconsistency that did us
in
Burchenal points at a depression a few hundred
yards away
BURCHENAL
(then points)
Thats what they call the
datum Sea level If there
was a sea Or when there
was a sea thats where it
was You can tell cause
the sand was created by
whats called the fluvial
process where water breaks
rocks into smaller and
smaller pieces Were the
first men on Mars Even if
it isnt gonna last long
(then)
Would you rather I shut up
so you can die quietly
GALLAGHER
Nah you can keep talking
Its kinda peaceful
In the bg headed towards a ridge of rocks
we can see a lone figure making its way along
Its Pettengill He steps around the ridge We
can hear his RADIO WHOOOSH TO STATIC as he
loses line of sight communication with the
others
Up ahead of him standing on the edge of an
enormous drop-off just staring out into
space is Santen His back is to us
Pettengill walks towards him Santen still
doesnt hear
Santens radio is off BEETHOVEN BLARES in his
helmet A 3000 foot drop at his feet It is
magnificent As Pettengill approaches and
Santen remains unaware the scene seems less
and less innocuous We fear for him Until
Pettengill just walks right up beside him and
stares out at the chasm as well Santen LOWERS
his MUSIC They stand there silently fora
moment Santen has some kind of weak-ass
epiphany

SANTEN
Look Im sorry I owe you
an apology Ive been a
dick I pick on people who
are weaker than I am
Its way too little way too late But
Pettengill doesnt let on Just nods As if
hes forgiven him Steps away and OUT OF
FRAME We HOLD ON Santen a moment
andPettengill has picked up what would be a
250-pound rock back on Earth and is heaving it
with all his might into Santen from behind It
slams into him bending him in half knocking
his feet out from under him
For half-a-moment we think Santen might regain
his footing But he doesnt He starts to fall
past the edge of the cliff Slowly In 38
grav SLOW MOTION Flailing Twisting in the
air As he falls looking up he slaps OFF the
MUSIC the RADIO COMES BACK ON Pettengill
leans over the edge
PETTENGILL
Fuck you Fuck you Im
gonna die But Im gonna
spend the next five minutes
of my life completely
satisfied knowing I killed
you
SANTEN
No you wont because
Pettengill shakes his head and steps back out
of the line of sight Santens last taunt
turns to STATIC
PETTENGILL
Yes I will
He turns and walks away
EXT MARS - HAB - DAY
Pettengill returns to the others He can hear
over the RADIO as he approaches -
BURCHENAL
Johannes Kepler was the
first to accurately map the
orbit of the planet In

PETTENGILL
Santens dead
They turn But not surprised They just figure
he -
BURCHENAL
Chewed through his air
PETTENGILL
He threw himself off the
cliff
GALLAGHER
Ouch
Burchenal bows his head down for a moment
overcome But its not Santen Its the bigger
picture
BURCHENAL
Its not often you get to
fail when 12 billion people
are counting on you
Gallaghers got more pressing problems Checks
his wrist unnerved
GALLAGHER
Im at under a minute here
You guys know what this is
gonna be like
BURCHENAL
Hypoxia Dizzy Skinll
tingle Vision narrows
Then anoxia Shock
convulsions acidosis
GALLAGHER
Gonna hurt
PETTENGILL
Yeah
A WARNING TONE GOES OFF on Gallaghers SENSOR
He starts to gasp Opens his mouth wide
Sucking in and out air thats worth less and
ess to his body
He begins to claw at the air Its not pretty
to watch Spins about seeking some release
None forthcoming Claws some more Falls to
his knees The others can barely watch They
now theyre next
Gallaghers growing more claustrophobic and
crazed Falls the rest of the way to the
ground Still clawing at the air Its
orrible to see And in one last desperate
angry trapped-feeling move reaches up and
unhooks the front of his helmet and throws it
back Croaks out a faint epitaph as he
collapses

GALLAGHER
Fuck this planet
And hes still Still And then in a last
reflexive shudder Gasps Gasps again Takes
in the worthless Mars atmosphere And right
when we think its entirely overTakes in
some more Breathes again And again Opens
his eyes
GALLAGHER
Im not dead
The other two are watching in amazement
GALLAGHER
Im not dead Its like
being at high altitude
Theres not much air here
But
Takes him a minute to catch his breath but
GALLAGHER
Were not gonna die
Burchenals suit ALARM GOES OFF He doesnt
screw with gasping in the suit Just opens the
damn thing up and prays Breathes Raggedly
BURCHENAL
It aint much But itll
do
He looks around puzzled
BURCHENAL
What the hells going on
here
Pettengills ALARM GOES OFF as well Much more
tentatively he removes his helmet Breathes
Hes not really rejoicing like the others
PETTENGILL
I thought wed be dead
The enormity of what hes done strikes him
PETTENGILL
I thought wed be dead
They all breathe the thin Martian air for a
moment
GALLAGHER
God if Santen had only
waited five more minutes
What a waste
OFF Pettengills completely unsettled face

FLASHBACK - INT ARES - ACCESS TUBE - NIGHT
SUPERIMPOSE MISSION TIME DAY 15
Dark Someone moves along And emerges into -
INT ARES - OBSERVATION SPHERE - NIGHT
An icosahedronal slice has been removed from
one side and replaced with optical glass A
billion stars are brighter and more numerous
than youve ever imagined Gallagher comes in
bumps smack into Chantilas Thought he was
alone
GALLAGHER
Sorry
CHANTILAS
Lotsa room
They lean back against the floor for a
moment and stare out at a billion and a half
stars
CHANTILAS
Know the stars at all
GALLAGHER
(pointing)
Andromeda Cassiopeia
Cetus Lepus Canis Minor
Were looking at what youd
see south around midnight
mid-May if we were on
Earth At about 42 degrees
Hes not showing off He just really does
know Chantilas looks at him surprised
GALLAGHER
My grandfather taught me to
sail when I was a kid
(fondly)
He made me learn the stars
in case all the GPS
satellites fell out of the
sky at once He said anyone
who put his life in the
hands of anything run by
batteries was a jackass
CHANTILAS
He sounds like quite a guy
GALLAGHER
He didnt like what he
called the easy answer or
the quick fix He didnt
want to own anything he
couldnt repair himself
(thinking back)
And oh yeah everything
automatic sooner or later
fails automatically
usually during or
immediately before a

crisis He had a lotta damn
sayings
(then)
He wouldntve approved of
this
CHANTILAS
Going to Mars
GALLAGHER
No That we killed off half
the living things on Earth
That after we all but
destroyed one planet with
global warming were
trying to bring another to
life the same way Kinda
tricky dont you think He
woulda said we were asking
for trouble
CHANTILAS
It looks like we got
trouble Thats why they
sent us
A beat They go back to staring at the
heavens Then -
GALLAGHER
I dont really get it You
quit being a scientist You
went back to school to
study God
CHANTILAS
I just realized science
couldnt answer any of the
really interesting
questions
(off Robbys look)
There are values that are
fundamental to an adequate
apprehension of the world
in which we live that cant
be expressed by equations
or experiments In that
you see the hand of God
(explaining)
Acknowledgment of basic
values Love kindness
joy Science doesnt have
much use for these Look
ugly theories are wrong We
know it by insight Science
doesnt want to accept
that We live in a moral
world and have moral
knowledge that tells us
that love and truth are
better than hatred and
lies But its modern to
think this is little more
than genetic imprinting or
a tacit communal cultural
agreement Thats not a
world I cared to live in
anymore

Robby stares back into the void This is not

the kind of conversation hes used to

GALLAGHER
I asked my grandfather once
if God existed He played
me Brahms Third Then he
asked me what good it was
Or was it just vibration
CHANTILAS
(following)
What good is beauty
GALLAGHER
He said if a man could
listen to Brahms and not
believe in God he was a
fool
CHANTILAS
I think I woulda liked your
grandfather

Robby turns to him

Yup

GALLAGHER
You didnt come on this
trip because of science at
all did you Thats why
they let you come but
youre going to Mars to
prove to yourself God
exists

CHANTILAS
Maybe Ill pick up a rock
and itll say so on the
bottom Made by God

GALLAGHER
Maybe Gods more subtle
than you are

(then)

You think were doing
something we shouldnt
Bud messing with another
planet

CHANTILAS

(unconcerned)

If so its because were
supposed to find something
out (then)
Lets say we didnt And we
finished poisoning off the
Earth and everyone was dead
in a hundred years Then
what was the point of any
of it Music art beauty

but -
love All gone The Greeks
the Romans the
Enlightenment the
Constitution people dying
for freedom ideas None of
that meant anything Id
rather go out and make a
mistake than live ina
world that bleak
GALLAGHER
No one said jack to me
about the Greeks and
Romans Shit I just came
along to fix stuff
CHANTILAS
Fooled ya didnt we Its
okay No one told the
others either
Theres a quiet moment Robby just came up to
stare at the stars Wasnt expecting all this
Then -
CHANTILAS
Theres a reason the
planets go around the stars
in exactly the same way
electrons go around the
nucleus of the atom Its
not an accident Theres a
design at the bottom of all
this Gods watching over
you
GALLAGHER
I just wish I didnt think
he was chuckling
END OF FLASHBACK
EXT HAB (MARS) - DAY
Gallagher Burchenal and Pettengill are still
stunned over the fact theyre alive
BURCHENAL
There shouldnt be enough
oxygen on Mars to do this
PETTENGILL
We never even got close to
a breathable atmosphere
Then the levels started to
drop and the sensors all
died I dont understand
whats going on here
Gallagher is rummaging through the wreckage of
the Hab Its been devastated
PETTENGILL
Wattya lookin for
Gallagher unearths a tangle of wire and
chewed-up circuits
GALLAGHER
This
He tosses it aside Its worthless
GALLAGHER
It used to be the radio I
dont mean to piss on the
parade guys but no one
knows were here Dont you
see The good news is we
can breathe The bad news
is unless we can tell
somebody now we get to
starve to death The only
mission left is rescue
INT ARES - FLIGHT DECK
The schematic she sent back to Earth is on the
screen here as well The ship is fucked-up
bad
SKAVLEM (VO)
The ground crews dead
your orbits unstable and
youre gonna burn in less
then a day and a half
(beat then)
Lets get you home
EXT HAB - DAY
The three of them rummage through the ravaged
structure News isnt good
BURCHENAL
We could head back to the
lander try to make
something work there
PETTENGILL
(wont make it)
Its six hours back
GALLAGHER
And it all ran through the
main computer which was
half-fried and dropped from
a great height
Shakes his head no That aint gonna help
Then Burchenal of all things grins
BURCHENAL
Gotta think about this
scientifically Theres
another radio Two
kilometers from here
GALLAGHER
I didnt see any stores on
the way over I miss a
Radio Hut
BURCHENAL
We sent it here Twenty
years before you were born
In 1997 Think where we
are
PETTENGILL
(gets it)
Were right over the edge
from the Ares Vallis The
Sojourner site
The HHCs are yanked out
PETTENGILL
There was a high-density
ridge ringing the valley
The algae never took there
Gallagher checks his watch
GALLAGHER
We still might have a
chance this pass We wait
long
They start to run towards a ridge to west Sun
hangs low in the sky Only an hour or so of
day left

CUT TO
GALLAGHER PETTENGILL AND BURCHENAL
with a goofy look on their faces Like kids at
Disneyland the first time Theyre standing
there looking at -
SAGANSOJOURNER SITE
The little rover All those damned named
rocks Our first big visit to Mars The
reverie is over quickly Gallagher tosses down
his bag of tools Walks over kneels beside
Sojourner (the rover)
GALLAGHER
Sorry about this
He pats it once and starts POWER-SCREWING off
the cover Tosses another tool to Burchenal
Re
the Sagan lander -
GALLAGHER
Rip the panels off
everything around the
aerial
(then)
Its a fifty-year-old off-
the-shelf computer radio
modem on a frequency that
were not using for this
mission
PETTENGILL
Then why are we bothering
GALLAGHER
Cause Id rather die doing
something than just sitting
there
CUT TO

EXT SOJOURNER SITE - DAY

Gallagher has cobbled together a radio from
50-year-old parts Pettengill holds the solar
panels at the sun while Robby carefully
removes one of his two suit-radio microphones
Checks with a meter then solders it onto his
jerry-rigged radio
GALLAGHER
Testing testing
He adjusts a tiny pot as he continues to call
out A green LED comes on flickering with his
voice
BURCHENAL
Does it work
GALLAGHER
Well the little green
thing lights up I dont
know if it works
(into mike)
This is Ares ground crew
come back This is Ares
ground crew do you copy
We PULL BACK WIDER AND WIDER They are so damn
alone
INT ARES - FLIGHT DECK - DAY

different vid screens

for you to lock out systems
17 22 and 40
Kate tries 40 freeflows doesnt lock out
BOWMAN
No joy
She resets everything
BOWMAN
Maybe were trying to be
way too subtle Why dont
we just jettison the damn
tank
SKAVLEM (VO)
Because the margins for
error are so small Theres
enough fuel to get you
home then if you dont
sneeze It makes us
nervous
BOWMAN
You want nervous
INT MISSION CONTROL
Over in the corner Schlissel is listening to
something on his headset thats blowing his
mind He starts waving three fingers
frantically at Skavlem and Russert They dont
respond fast enough for him He reaches over

(beat then)
Oh and by the way we can
breathe

INT MISSION CONTROL - NIGHT

SKAVLEM
You can breathe

GALLAGHER (VO)
Not real well but yeah

(then)

Hey KateWeve changed
our mind Get us outta
here Wed like to come
home

If the room was at a standstill before now
its frozen Is there hope

SKAVLEM
If they can breathe can we
live there

LOWENTHAL
No Ninety percent of the
algaes gone Its some
kind of freak anomaly Mars
is a dying planet Just
like Earth

RUSSERT
Theyre breathing It
coulda worked Dammit it
coulda worked

Then through the cacophony comes one voice
SCHLISSEL
It doesnt matter Theyre
going to die tonight
anyhow In an hour the sun
sets on Mars Its going to
be minus 140 They cannot
survive in the open
Theyre going to die
Yow Everyone shuts up Its ugly but true
LOWENTHAL
Hes right You can walk
across the South Pole long
as you stay moving and
youre wearing insulating
clothing - the suitsll
work - you can stay warm
But once they stop moving
without shelter theyre
gonna die
SCHLISSEL
Her orbit could degrade at
any time She could auger
in and burn while they chat
about old times and freeze
to death Its a waste We
should just bring her home
Skavlem doesnt love it but -
SKAVLEM
We can get a free return
trajectory now Shes got
enough food and water to
bring one person back
Russert not happy at all but -
RUSSERT
Youre not wrong
Nods to Skavlem

SKAVLEM
Commander this is Mission
Control

INT ARES - FLIGHT DECK - DAY

BOWMAN
No

SKAVLEM (VO)
Maam

BOWMAN

Im not stupid John I
know what the question is
Id ask it if I was there
And the answer is no So
lets move on

(then)
By my calculations if I
ditch my reserve tank now
and commit to a three-
second apogee burn I
stabilize my orbit for
another eighteen hours Id
like someone to check the
numbers as my apogees in
seven minutes
INT MISSION CONTROL - NIGHT
Russert has to grin Its gonna drive him
crazy and its exactly what hed do Before
any of them can bitch and whine -
RUSSERT
Come on people you heard
the woman lets get on it
The techs begin calculating madly
EXT MARS SURFACE - DAY
The crew is coming down a rise toward the Hab
Carrying the radio Walking back quickly Sun
is flat over the horizon Shadows are long
already getting cold You can see their
breath
BOWMAN (VO)
Theres some concern at
Mission Control About the
weather
GALLAGHER
(deadpan)
Its gonna rain
BOWMAN (VO)
Its gonna get a little
chilly
GALLAGHER
I could see that Its
dropped about fifty degrees
in the last half hour We
figure a hundred below
fairly soon
INT ARES - FLIGHT DECK - NIGHT
Bowman is doing her best to keep the tone
light But shes gotta know whether or not he
thinks hes gonna live or die
GALLAGHER (VO)
It would have been nice to
be in the Hab And there
aint no other motel to
check into

BOWMAN
You have a plan Any
thoughts on how you
mightstay alive
EXT HAB (MARS) - ALMOST SUNSET
Theyre back at the Hab now We cant quite
tell whats going on but Burchenal and
Pettengill are busy doing something noisy and
furious in the bg Crashing bashing
breaking Burchenal flicks open an entrenching
tool Thumbs a button edge whizzes by like a
tiny chain saw Chews through something and
GALLAGHER
Yeah
Behind Gallagher is a whoooosh of flame as
Pettengill gets the debris hes piled in the
middle of the Hab to light Hes got stacks of
additional fuel nearby
GALLAGHER
Were gonna have a 75
million dollar campfire
EXT HAB (MARS) - 20 MINUTES LATER
The sun sets First sunset on Mars man has
seen Red upon red upon red Fire burns behind
them Sky turns black Fast A billion stars
And then a METEORITE begins to fall Its
huge Its red It EXPLODES
GALLAGHER
What the hell was that
BURCHENAL
She ditched the B tank
She must be figuring
theres an even chance
well live through the
night
EXT SPACE - NIGHT
The Ares lights up and burns for three long
seconds And off
INT ARES - FLIGHT DECK - NIGHT
Bowman checks the gauges Eight liters was
burned
BOWMAN
Hell whats eight liters
(answers herself
Itll either save their
lives or Ive screwed up
getting home and Ill spend
the next three hundred
years circling this planet
EXT HAB - NIGHT
Burchenal pokes at the flames Theyre spread
out and low Flickering yellow and blue
BURCHENAL
I think well make it
through Theres so little
02 this is gonna burn real
slow
Gallagher picks up a piece of scrap about to
feed it into the flames then stops examines
it by the light of the fire It looks like
someone took a rasp to it He gets up turns
on a suit light and looks over the remaining
ribs of the structure

GALLAGHER
What happened to this
place Everything but the
titanium supports were just
chewed up Could a dust
stormve done this

BURCHENAL
No prevailing pattern to
the damage I dont know
what couldve done it
Nor does it matter right now They sit back
around the fire and relish the warmth Out in
the darkness past a rise something catches
Robbys eye A flash a reflection Of the
fire On what And then its gone He doesnt
bother to mention it Writes it off
TWO HUNDRED YARDS AWAY
Behind a hill AMEE crouches in the dark Pops
up again looks over sees the three men and
the fire Lowers back down - youd swear she
was thinking - then silently ambles away
BACK AROUND FIRE
The weird tableau of three men in spacesuits
around a campfire on Mars A moment then -
GALLAGHER
You still think we had any
business coming to Mars
Screwing with stuff Trying
to spread life You think
maybe Gods teaching us
some hardass lesson
Pettengill just makes some kind of weird
gulping noise and turns away They let him be
BURCHENAL
God You talked to
Chantilas too much on the
trip over I dont mean to
burst your bubble but
Gods the retreat of the
ignorant the weak and the
hopeless
GALLAGHER
I bet you dont believe in
Santa And youre no fun at
all at Christmas
(then)
Not everything gets an
explanation you can write
down as a formula
BURCHENAL
Son Im a scientist A
geneticist as good as they
come I write code just
like a hacker Four
elements AGTP in
different orders back the
genome And your kidneys
work or you grow a sixth
finger I line up
unconscious atoms and they
give rise to conscious
beings Its like if I
stacked up a bunch of rocks
in the right order and they
become a dog I do that I

chose when I chose where

I chose how many fingers I

just dont hold with

mystical explanations for

science with organized

religion buildings with

different symbols on ‘em

You spot God you lemme

know Till then I put my

trust in my three PhDs

(then)

But I think lifes an

amazing thing And I

believe that when you get

it you should grab it with

both hands and live as much

of it as you can Which is

why I am not happy about

losing it on this damn ugly

planet
Burchenal shuts his eyes We PUSH IN ON
Gallagher looking rueful and
FLASHBACK - INT ARES - HYGIENE SPHERE —- DAY
SUPERIMPOSE MISSION TIME DAY 32
Gallagher comes in His timing depending how
you look at it is very good or very bad
Bowman steps out of the shower To dry off
Its too late for Robby to stop or recoup He
has to tough it out and try to act like an
adult Bowman sees his discomfort Shes
amused

BOWMAN
Its okay I had brothers
GALLAGHER
I have two sisters
(gives up)
Neither of them were this
fine
Now she colors
BOWMAN

The only way this works is
if we both make believe it
doesnt matter
GALLAGHER
I tried I really tried
(then)
Maybe I should go fix
something
BOWMAN
(laughing now)
Maybe you should
He hesitates leaves She starts to vacuum dry
her hair

INT MISSION CONTROL - NIGHT
Place is ragged
coffee on the workstations
techs as unshaven and beat
as the crew on Mars
RUSSERT
All right people we
bought ourselves another
eighteen hours in orbit
The crews burning pretty
much what weve got on the
surface so they dont
freeze solid So whatever
we can come up with
LOWENTHAL
has got to work before
the sun sets again tomorrow
and they freeze to death

anyhow

RUSSERT
What else is on Mars

SCHLISSEL
Rocks Sand

RUSSERT

The janitor just built a
radio out of a fifty-year-
old Rover mission Now
what else is on Mars
Mars maps come up on all their PIMs There are
things on the surface Marked with various
symbols Leftovers from other missions
SKAVLEM
We sent a dozen probes even
before the biologics
started up Eight were
return missions

LOWENTHAL
And theyre back

SKAVLEM
Theres a Viking lander

SCHLISSEL

2200 kilometers away
Silence They all stare at the PIMs And then
Schlissel turns to a nearby TECH -

SCHLISSEL
SYF
TECH
Slap your forehead
SCHLISSEL

Were not the only people
who sent stuff to Mars
Other overlays come up on the maps New
colors New symbols
SKAVLEM
The Twenties were nothing
but unmanned sample return
missions Everyone wanted
to bring back a bucket of
Mars rocks
They find something near the Hab
SCHLISSEL
There was Euro-Malaysian
sample return mission 2018
TECH
Checking
LOWENTHAL
(knows)
It blew up on attempted
return
Looking further afield they find something
else
TECH
It aint close but theres
an Uzbecki SRM that
failed to launch
SCHLISSEL
(argh)
An Uzbecki probe from 2032
RUSSERT
Is it viable Can we get
plans
SCHLISSEL
It was built at the Cosmos
factory in Garagin in 2031
(theres more)
The factory closed eight
years later And then it
burnt down
All right thats the end of that And then
Schlissel spots a detail that means something
to him

SCHLISSEL
It was designed by
Aleksandr Ivanovich
Borokovski He was the last
of the greats in the
Russian space program

RUSSERT
Is he still alive

Schlissels PIM flickers madly as he mutters
at it

SCHLISSEL
Theres no closing date on
his bio Hed be in his
seventies

RUSSERT
Find him Somebody get on
the line to Kazakhstan

LOWENTHAL

Theyve lived through the night Gallagher
walks off twenty paces When we see him again
hes unlocked the top and bottom of his suit
and dropped the trousers to his knees
GALLAGHER
Im the first man to piss
on Mars
Burchenal and Pettengill follow suit on the
other side of the Hab A beat then -

BURCHENAL
Damn

PETTENGILL
Whoa

BURCHENAL

You sure get some arc in
this low gravity
The suns gonna break any minute Something
suddenly hits Burchenal He yanks up his
pants runs to remains of the Hab Looks
around desperately Pulls free a metal rib
Turns to Gallagher
BURCHENAL
Run Towards the sun
Robby understands or doesnt bother to ask
why Takes off Burchenal yanks free a shard
of metal Pounds it into the sand a dozen feet
from the Hab The sun is just breaking the
horizon Robby is fifty yards away
BURCHENAL
Stop Left Left A little
more Right Mark it
He adjusts his own peg a tad Robby comes
loping back

the plan It doesnt impress them
GALLAGHER
Thats it We walk a

sitting there for 30 years
(are you kidding)
Thats the best plan they
could come up with
BOWMAN (VO)
Its the only plan they
could come up with
GALLAGHER
(reconsiders)
I guess that makes it best

How bout something
simpler Like how many
degrees it is off from the

marked it Im figurin
were within half a degree

in hell But not much
moren that

playground games
GALLAGHER
Okay
Hes done She can leave now

GALLAGHER
Grapes dont grow well
hydroponicallySo we ah
used potatoes

BOWMAN
Youre making moonshine
vodka on my ship

BURCHENAL
Well yes maam But we
ran it through the Gas
Chromatograph Mass
Spectrometer and the
impurity levels are very
low

BOWMAN
Hows it taste

Burchenal is the first to realize theyre off
the hook

BURCHENAL
Its a little rough

BOWMAN
Are you going to offer me a
drink

BURCHENAL

Of course That would be
the polite thing to do
He does She tosses it back Woooof
BOWMAN
Thats a little rough How
much have you made
BURCHENAL
bout three liters
She considers Then -
BOWMAN
Youre done Dismantle the
science project Offer
equal rations to the crew
Mr Santen doesnt drink or
approve of those who do
(stern again)
Now tell me the truth How
much were you cutting this
GALLAGHER

trying to stop it The

things were so damn good

they killed everything in

wheat

melancholy)

We fucked up our own back
yard hit the Malthusian
wall and tried to breed
our way out of it Maybe we
dont deserve another

chance

Then he shakes it off Laughs
BURCHENAL
Dont worry if we need any
help on the surface Im
allowed to grow us some

six-fingered lab
assistants

He cracks up again Hes wasted Knows it
BURCHENAL
I gotta go to bed

really likes the horse

BOWMAN

Youre serious

GALLAGHER
He pines for the horse

You
BOWMAN

I dont have a horse
GALLAGHER

Thats too bad
He takes another swig Offers it to her She
matches him
GALLAGHER
Can I ask you something
very personal
BOWMAN
Okay
GALLAGHER
Its about bras and space
She looks at him

BOWMAN
I dont wear a bra in
space

GALLAGHER
I know

BOWMAN

Bras are designed to hold
your boobs in place on
Earth where theres real
gravity Why would I need
one in space

GALLAGHER
Cause its really fucking
distracting

BOWMAN
You want me to wear a bra

GALLAGHER
No Not at all Im sorry I
ever brought this up

The good news is neither of them will remember
in the morning Much Another round Then -

BOWMAN
Do you have someone waiting
for you back home Or a
horse

GALLAGHER
With the kind of jobs Ive
had its very hard to
maintain any kind of
relationship Sono
horses

BOWMAN
Or maybe you took those
jobs cause you didnt want
anyone waiting for you Or

maybe

GALLAGHER
No I like horses just
fine

Theyve floated very close
BOWMAN
You know youre not who I
thought you were at first

GALLAGHER
Is that an insult or a
compliment

BOWMAN

Theyre very very close And very drunk Its
when he should kiss her But he doesnt

It wasnt a virus

Rollin rollin rollin
keep them doggies rollin
EXT MARS SURFACE - DAY
Theyre all exhausted and a little punchy
BURCHENAL
How long can a man go
without food or water
GALLAGHER
How long can you go without
singing that dumb song
Burchenal looks hurt Walks another few paces
Begins to sing again Gallagher turns to
Pettengill
GALLAGHER
Theres two of us And we
can stop him from singing
Pettengill considers Then sings along
instead They only know the one line Its
really annoying
GALLAGHER
What is that
BURCHENAL
I have no idea Its old
though Its classic music
GALLAGHER
I dont know the classics
This sets Burchenal off He sings some more -
BURCHENAL
Mars aint a place to raise
your kids
In fact its cold as hell
And theres no one there to raise them
If you dig
GALLAGHER
What the hell is that
BURCHENAL
You dont know any of the
classics do you He was a
rocket man

GALLAGHER
An astronaut wrote that

BURCHENAL
Never mind

GALLAGHER
Sing the one about the dogs
again

BURCHENAL
Its about cows

GALLAGHER
Then why does it say
doggies

All this time theyve been walking across a
landscape pigmented with color - steel blue
alizarin crimson malachite green - the algae
varietals everywhere And then off to the
left the algae stops Erased like it was
never there extirpated in a long crooked
line

PETTENGILL

What the fuck
GALLAGHER
Yeah what the fuck You
said doggies
Then he sees as well They all see Cant help
themselves Theyre drawn towards it
Gallagher and Burchenal check their course in
the distance before veering off Pettengill is
already heading towards it
Its maybe 100 yards away At 50 something
indistinct can be seen Sort of Its like the
line and the surrounding terrain is out of
focus blurry At 30 the blurriness comes
into focus Its alive It moves slightly You
can see through it At ten you can see it
undulating Slowly TOWARDS us Erasing the
algae the color slowly spreading outwards
behind and diffusing And then we can see
A billion a hundred billionnematodes
Little tiny translucent worms Eating the
algae Slowly irrevocably Advancing
Pettengill pulls out his entrenching tool
Carefully separates one out Lifts it up to
the light to see Maybe three inches long
skinnier than an earthworm One end lifts in
the air a tri-part mouth with little
crystalline teeth opening and closing
searching for something to eat
Its fucking scary It gets worse when you
realize how many of them there are The lines
moved three or four inches closer as they
stand there They take a step back No one can
really speak yet
GALLAGHER
What
PETTENGILL
Its a nematode Or
something like one Its
probably this skinny so it
defrosts each morning when
the sun hits them Or
theyr enot water-based at
all
GALLAGHER
Is it something we sent up
by accident with the
probes
PETTENGILL
No
GALLAGHER
I thought we said there
wasnt any life on this
planet
PETTENGILL
We did We were wrong
Maybe there wasnt when we
checked I dont know Its
not from Earth
(beat yow)
And its not from here
BURCHENAL
This cant be This cant
be
Burchenal actually seems kind of upset about
it Gallagher looks at him Say what Burch is
upset
BURCHENAL
It cant be here You dont
understand The odds of
there being any other life
in the universe are
infinitesimally small The
odds that it could survive
on something other than its
home planet are equally
astronomical The odds that
it could travel to another
solar system let alone one
where life already existed
areimpossible
GALLAGHER
But its here
BURCHENAL
Yeah
Burchenal seems almost unhappy about this It
rocks his world In a bad way Gallagher turns
to Pettengill happily and untroubled
GALLAGHER
Well it looks like were
not alone in the universe
You just discovered life on
another planet pal
It takes a moment for this to sink in Then
something hits Robby
GALLAGHER
Made by God Thats whats
stamped on the bottom
Thats what Bud would have
said He woulda loved this
Gallagher gets down on one knee and looks at
them Theyre kinda horrible but as he turns
to Pettengill -
GALLAGHER
You know what this means
Youre gonna be more famous
than Darwin Theyre gonna
name buildings after you
Spacecrafts cities on
Mars
The enormity of how badly Pettengill has
screwed up - that in the space of one day
hes committed murder and discovered life on
another planet - begins to dawn on him He
doesnt handle it well Hes fucked up like
few people can imagine He tries to reset it
doesnt work The worm twists about starts to
eat the metal right off the entrenching tool
He flicks it back to its relatives

PETTENGILL
Right Right Motherfuck
Motherfuck
And then he says something really odd -
PETTENGILL
Name them after Santen
BURCHENAL
You hated Santen
PETTENGILL
Yeah

He storms away Theyre both confused by this
Pettengill finds a rock sits down behind it
Hes obscured except for his head and
shoulders

PETTENGILL
I need a minute or two

GALLAGHER
You wanna tell Houston

PETTENGILL

Go ahead You do it Just
give me a few minutes
INT ARES - FLIGHT DECK - DAY

LOWENTHAL
(concerned)
Theyre hallucinating
BURCHENAL
Pettengills a bit
overcome Or hed be
telling you about it
himself But the discovery
goes to him
(baffled but)
Though he wants to name
them after Santen
SKAVLEM
Youre saying theres
Martian life
PETTENGILL
(calling out from
behind the rock)
No that theres life on
Mars Were not saying
where it came from But not
Earth Fuck
They all disregard that last bit
GALLAGHER
Theyre like some kind of
translucent worms
SKAVLEM
Youre all seeing these
BURCHENAL
Oh yeah Theyre here What
did you think this was
hypoxia
They did
EXT MARS SURFACE - DAY
Conversations over Gallagher walks towards
the rock -
GALLAGHER
We should get outta here
Pettengill doesnt respond
BURCHENAL
Really We should get
going
Gallagher walks over We hear a familiar
WHINE Dont recognize what it is at first
Until Gallagher around the rock and sees
Pettengills flicked on the WHIZZING CUTTING
EDGE of the entrenching TOOL Shreds his left
wrist Lifts it and rips through his carotid
arteries All but cuts off his head as he
falls to the ground Suits awash with BLOOD
Overflowing onto the ground and him BURBLING
in spurts Some hits the worms
BURCHENAL
JesusJesus God
Burchenals joined him Theres nothing they
could do Only watch in shock It gets worse
The worms come Pulsating and undulating
towards Pettengill As if some secret message
the food is here has spread through the
billions of them in burst of knowledge
A diaphanous hungry wave crests onto
Pettengill and engulfs him Hes covered in
translucence as they devour him Gallagher and
Burchenal stagger backwards in horror as a red
aureole grows around him as hes eaten Color
spreads out around him in a perfect ever-
growing circle Its a feast
WIDE
The two of them walk along Cant tell if
theyre hurrying towards something or away
Theyve both figured out whats up A beat
then -

GALLAGHER
He killed Santen

BURCHENAL
Yep

GALLAGHER

Probably figured we were
gonna die anyhow
BURCHENAL
Yep Figured wrong For

now
GALLAGHER
(beat then)
Nobody deserves to die like
that
BURCHENAL
No

INT MISSION CONTROL - DAY
Theres a general buzz of animated scientific
debate One voice cuts through -

Weve thawed out three and
four-million-year-old
organisms from the
permafrost in Siberia and
theyve come back to life
Its possible
RUSSERT
So even if there wasnt
life there there is now
SCHLISSEL
And we warmed the place up
and sent it something to
eat
LOWENTHAL
It could have sat there for
millions of years since

in on a frozen meterorite
from anywhere And waited

been punched It takes her a moment to

Requiescat in Pace
EXT MARS SURFACE - DAY
The sun is way past its zenith It hangs
noticeably lower in the sky Maybe four or
five oclock Burchenal and Gallagher plod
along Theyre beat Theres no singing
theres no banter Theyre just trying to keep
moving
INT ARES - FLIGHT DECK - DAY
Bowman finds them again with 10m scope Marks
it Computer analyzes their position The
results arent encouraging Their average
speed has been steadily dropping Theres only
two hours left till dark Theyve gone 79
kilometers And theyre projected to get 885
kilometers before nightfall Theyre gonna
miss getting to the Cosmos by about an hour
EXT MARS SURFACE - DAY
Its worse Theyre stumbling Not keeping in
all that straight a line Having to constantly
re-check their position RADIO CRACKLES
BOWMAN (VO)
Ground Crew this is Ares
(studiously casual)
Hows it goin
They look at each other Is she kidding
GALLAGHER
Weve just done a little
over two marathons back to
back We havent had
anything to eat or drink in
two days There are these
worms that want to eat us
and a mad robot who wants
to kill us Why do you ask
He starts to laugh For some weird reason
Burchenal joins him
BOWMAN (VO)
Youre not going to like
what I have to say
BURCHENAL
Youre going home Bring us
some chicken
They crack up anew
BOWMAN (VO)
You have to pick up the
pace
They laugh Its not funny but they really
laugh
BURCHENAL
Were not gonna make it
BOWMAN (VO)
At this pace youll make
about ninety kilometers
Burchenal shakes himself Digs into some deep
reserve Picks up his speed and shouts -
BURCHENAL
We Sleep Till Brooklyn
He totters off towards the horizon
BOWMAN (VO)
What was that
GALLAGHER
Coopers been singing
classic music I dont know
most of it
BURCHENAL
No Sleep Till Brooklyn
GALLAGHER
Neither does he I think he
knows one line from each
song Well try to go
faster We really will
Hes trying to convince himself as well as
her But he does pick up the pace and push
after Burch and
INT MISSION CONTROL - NIGHT
Borokovski has listened in curiously to this
exchange

BOROKOVSKI
Why is he speaking of
Brooklyn

SCHLISSEL

Hes singing classic music
to keep his spirits up
The tech looks at him curiously
SCHLISSEL
I studied it in college
Its the Beastie Guys Most
of the music we listen to
today is based on the
ground-breaking work they
did before the turn of the
century
EXT MARS SURFACE - 40 MINUTES LATER
Theyre stumbling Literally Gallagher just
stops
GALLAGHER
You know I dont care if I
weigh 60 pounds on Mars I
am one tired doggie
Gallagher sits down on a rock Burchenal
collapses nearby They cant go any further
Burchenal catches his breath
BURCHENAL
Ten K short
The sun is a finger above the horizon Redder
than red breathtakingly beautiful
BURCHENAL
Its pretty
GALLAGHER
Too bad were gonna be
dead I cant keep walking
in circles And theres
nothing to keep us warm
They look around unhappily Ugly way to die
GALLAGHER
Its gonna be like trying
to live on Mount Everest
BURCHENAL
What would we do if we were
on Mount Everest
Thinks a long time

GALLAGHER
I would have brought a
tent

BURCHENAL

If we didnt have a tent
Robbys so tired hes confused

GALLAGHER
We dont have a tent

BURCHENAL
Yeah Yeah I know

GALLAGHER

Id guess youd dig a snow
cave Use the snow for
insulation Youve seen the
3Ds
Theres a funky-looking hillock nearby Five
feet high as big around Burchenal totters to
his feet Goes over and kicks it Its soft
volcanic rock
BURCHENAL
Lets dig a snow cave
GALLAGHER
Theres no snow
Burchenal kicks at it again Gives He takes
out the entrenching tool hacks at it Knocks
a piece free
BURCHENAL
Lets dig a snow cave or
were gonna fucking die
He starts to wail on it Gallagher staggers
over and joins him The two of them start to
flail away like a cross between prehistoric
man and giant beavers desperate as -
EXT MARTIAN HORIZON
The sun begins to set 30 miles away the
terminus the line where night turns to day
begins to advance across the planet towards
them In the dark of the shadow the FROST
forms a dozen feet behind and follows growing
GROWLING - the cold advancing TOWARDS us with
a CRACKLING CRUNCHING FREEZING WHINE Its as
if the cold has a sound
BACK AT HILLOCK
Gallagher and Burchenal can see the darkness
approaching Digging madly Cackling Losing
their minds Cant tell who is who as theyre
silhouetted against the sun one now inside
the hillock throwing rock back as the other
clears
The sun continues to drop Terminus continues
its pernicious HISSING and freezing approach
Halfway inside now On his knees suit light
on Gallagher chops away at the rock When
hes thigh-deep in debris he backs out
dragging the leavings with him Burchenal
leaps in replacing him Dripping in sweat
nutty but at least theyre doing something
The last of the sun disappears Their breath
is in the air The darkness and frost reaches
them now The sweat begins to freeze ice in
their hair and eyebrows and stubble But
theyve dug most of the shelter They continue
to thrash and chop away The frost is now
everywhere

Gallagher climbs inside Burchenal drags a
lava boulder over to seal the entrance Climbs
in hooks his tool into the rock and seals it
shut
INT CAVE - NIGHT

Its not big The two of them are scrunched
into balls They chop away and pack the debris
in the entry tunnel to block the cold Shaking
bitterly Lips blue

EXT MARS SURFACE - NIGHT

Nothing Darkness Rocks And in the midst of
it all our crazy hillocksnow cave

INT HILLOCKCAVE - NIGHT

Gallagher looks up to find Burchenal staring
at him Actually not exactly at him At his
forehead

GALLAGHER
What Is this some kind of
cartoon moment where youre
imagining Im a giant
chicken and youre going to

eat me

BURCHENAL
Its melting

GALLAGHER
Its a Wizard of Oz moment

BURCHENAL

The ice on your forehead is
melting The rocks really
insulating us We might not
freeze to death
GALLAGHER
Oh Good
And then the enormity of whats gone on hits
them And the exhaustion Adrenaline is gone
Gallagher physically droops Burchenal
follows
GALLAGHER
Ive never been this tired
Ive never hurt this bad
You think dead is worse
than this
BURCHENAL
Hell well probably know
soon Shut up Rest
GALLAGHER
We oughta probably tell
someone were not frozen
solid Yet
Burchenal checks his watch
BURCHENAL

Their breath condenses on the ceiling
Freezes Then falls down Its snowing
Theyve got their own weather system
Gallagher watches it fall Burchenal seems
kinda pissed

BURCHENAL
No I dont know why the
worms are here No I dont
know why were still alive

GALLAGHER
Theres gotta be a reason

A moment then -

BURCHENAL
Youre talking about faith
son Faith is another way
of saying I know something
you dont know but I cant
tell you cause its a
secret But I dont know
why I know it
life

(agitated)

I live in the real world
Ive lived there my whole
Im comfortable

GALLAGHER

Were not in the real
world Were on Mars
(softly)

Nobody gets in a rocket

some kind of faith Do

Burchenal doesnt answer Not directly But he
looks like a third grader busted in some
elaborate story he cant keep up

Sits quietly a moment then turns off the

current fuel status position and projected

EXT MARS SURFACE - NIGHT
Dead quiet The two small moons shine faintly
A rime of ice covers everything The hillock
shimmers in the feeble light The rock
entrance is sealed over with frost
INT CAVE - NIGHT
Gallagher and Burchenal breathe shallowly The
inside of the cave is covered in white flaking
hoarfrost Lips are blue Skin is pale
Gallaghers eyes open Somethings wrong
Doesnt know what And then he realizes the
air moving in and out of his lungs isnt doing
him any good at all The door is caked shut
with ice Theres no air
He moves badly uncoordinated but manages to
chop and shove it open Fresh ice cold air
rushes in Burchenal awakes Only half-
responsive Gallagher grabs him drags him
out
GALLAGHER
Breathe Breathe
EXT MARS SURFACE - NIGHT
Cognizance returns Burchenal looks at his
watch
It doesnt make any sense Three hours have
passed Three hours
BURCHENAL
Son of a bitch Son of a

for three hours
Gallagher desperately hauls out the radio
GALLAGHER
Ares this is ground crew
Ares this is ground crew
BURCHENAL
Forget it Shes dayside
again If shes even still
here
(then)
We gotta get to Cosmos
Burchenal looks around Oh GodIt gets
worse
BURCHENAL
Cant see the landmarks
Gallagher starts to madly scan the night sky
GALLAGHER
We gotta keep moving
He yanks out his HCC Mutters rapidly into it
We see the map appear HabCosmos line marked
Then a star chart for Mars on this day and
time He calls for it to change to a horizon
projection The machine freezes computes
Brings up a horizon It matches what Robby
sees And highlights a star sitting just above
the horizon that will lead them on their way
Canis Minor They start to run
A beat AMEE rises up silently from behind a
rock and watches them go
EXT MARS - SURFACE - NIGHT
The two men run Lit by the two moons Phobos
and Deimos - Fear and Terror Its
unbelievably cold Plumes of breath light up
around them as they go Following the star on
the horizon Across a valley over a ridge
Over a dune Scrambling
Up and over the next long long gradient They
lose the star over this false horizon as they
climb Theres something odd however A faint
broad wash of light coming over the lip They
crest the rise to reveal -
VALLEY
Completely covered in phosphorescent algae
Pale green and glowing A mile across a mile
wide If they werent rushing for their lives
it would be worth stopping to stare
Across the vale Canis Minor sits directly in
the center of a small mountain pass Theyre
about to dash onward when something -
intuition its hard to say what - hits
Burchenal
BURCHENAL
Stop
GALLAGHER
What
Burchenals not quite sure at first But wont
enter the algae Walks left walks right
Kneels down
The algae glows Otherworldly And then
movement In the fg a worm green glowing
and filled with algae slithers through And
then another And another indistinguishable
from the plants around them theyve imbibed
And then as Burchenal plays his light out
across the valley we realize its entirely
full of worms Gallagher takes an appalled
step back Theyre fucked
GALLAGHER
Were fucked
Burchenal considers for a moment And yeah
probably has that epiphany Then-
BURCHENAL
(re the pass)
Get to the closest point
you can safely Im gonna
go down to that end
He starts to run to the far end
GALLAGHER
What are you gonna do

Burchenals far enough away now that his voice
comes over the SUIT RADIO
BURCHENAL (VO)
Im gonna distract them

GALLAGHER
Youre gonna distract the
worms

BURCHENAL (VO)
Yeah

Perhaps Gallagher ought to give this more
thought But he doesnt Maybe its the
exhaustion Maybe it just never would have
occurred to him Burchenal disapears into the
darkness and the distance Gallagher waits
Then -
BURCHENAL (VO)
You ready
GALLAGHER
Yeah
BURCHENAL (VO)
Good Lemme know when it
starts to clear
Gallagher doesnt get it But a moment later
a shiver runs through the worms And they
start to undulate away Towards Burchenal
Pulsing faster and faster until its clear in
a moment or two like a giant amoebae
withdrawing he will have clear access to the
pass
BURCHENAL
at the far end is five hundred yards into the
worms They know Theyve told each other And
theyre coming in pulsating waves Towards
him At the epicenter He gags And hears -
GALLAGHER (VO)
(stunned)
Its clear
Burchenal tries to turn around Hes mired
now And theyre up to his waist Its a
fucking nematode feeding frenzy
BURCHENAL
Good
He cant even lift his feet Theyre beginning
to cover him now He can see the color of his
suit spreading around him as they devour it
BURCHENAL
(then oddly calm)
You were right son
Theres gotta be a reason
This cant just be an
accident I dont know what
the wormsre doing here or
how they got here But
science dont explain it
And it pisses me off to no
end
Gallagher turns He can see now what Burchenal
has done A tiny glowing figure can be seen
1000 yards away Gallaghers speechless at
first
BURCHENAL
Im gonna have to turn off
my radio in a sec So you
dont have to hear me
screaming like a girl
GALLAGHER
What have you done
BURCHENAL
Finding out theres things
I dont understand That
science dont know squat
about Maybe even the damn
Earths worth saving
Someones gotta give it a
try Gotta find out about
these worms Go get off
this fucking planet
During which weve CUT TO Gallagher cause
you dont want to see this
BURCHENAL (VO)
Theres two women in
Missoula one in Bozeman
Tell them each they were my
last words And make sure
my horse gets sold to
someone who knows how to
ride
(then)
Oh my Lord
RADIO GOES SILENT Across the distance we can
see a figure now entirely coated in luminous
worms writhing wildly Gallagher leaves his
light on starts to run As Robby flees we
PULL BACK FURTHER and FURTHER until hes just
a tiny figure in the landscape - until we are
AT what was Burchenal The frenzy is all but
over
The phosphorescence is gone in the center of
the circle The edges are the color of his
suit Then blood red for forty yards Bits of
bone white And then right in the dead center
as we watch gray spreading spreading as
what was once Burchenals brain is food for
worms
EXT MARS SURFACE - NIGHT
Gallagher scrambles up steeper and steeper
to the edge of the valley and the ridge line
From the top he can see the way below is his
prize - the Cosmos Checks his watch
hopefully desperately triggers the radio

No algae on his side He leaves a trail of
phosphorescent footprints as he goes They
grow fainter and fainter as he descends

Bowman comes rushing in Too fast Slams up
into a wall Resets Belts herself in
EXT COSMOS SITE - NIGHT
Its been sitting there for 30 years As he
approaches the solar panels turn and track
towards his light Its still waiting Sits on
six over-built legs Sample return vehicle
launches off the base Liquid fuel tanks
sample return container the size of a large
trash can We hear -
BOWMAN (VO)
How you doing
GALLAGHER
(unsettled)
Its really cold My
fingers arent sure they
want to work
BOWMAN (VO)
You can do this
(then)
The maintenance port has a
cover It should be marked
Gallagher looks it over Minor stumbling
block
GALLAGHER
Yeah In Cyrillic
Finds it anyhow He flexes his unresponsive
fingers and after a try or two unscrews the
cover reveals an IR port
GALLAGHER
Got it
BOWMAN (VO)
All right Im gonna
download this to you
Gallagher yanks out his HHC Dozen adapters in
the back Finds the one that fits the old
modem port on the jerry-rigged radio
GALLAGHER
Go
Plugs it in Stuff flashes On the HHC
Windows comes up the Cosmos LaunchMaster
program Cyrillic crudely relabeled in
English Unplugs the modem so he can speak
again
GALLAGHER
Its still got power
BOWMAN (VO)
You should be able to run

Theres a diagnostics check and launch check
He hits diagnostics The two talk link up
and - a Windows error screen comes up on the
HHC
Warning - your system has become busy or
unstable Press Ctrl-Alt-Delete to exit
programs and reboot
GALLAGHER
I know now why it didnt
launch

words)
Control alt delete
Reboots in the blink of an eye Systems check
positive
GALLAGHER
Its looking good

Okay this thing only has
two settings On and off

back to Earth As you dont
have air food or water
that would be bad

Bowman is calculating madly as she goes on
Trying to sound calm Shes anything but
BOWMAN
We want just enough lift
for escape velocity With
the weight you left at and
the suitI peg you at

take 200 pounds of rocks
home Tanks are seven
liters each You need to
take two liters out of each
tank Theres a central
purge youre gonna have to
be exact
EXT COSMOS SITE - DAY
As she continues -
BOWMAN (VO)
And you better try to find
something to put the fuel
in and get it the hell away
from there as we dont
want it to go up when the
rocket goes off
Gallagher considers Yeah it all makes sense
But how
CUT TO
EXT COSMOS SITE - MINUTES LATER
Gallagher using the few tools he has left
has unbolted the sample return container
Measures its width -
GALLAGHER
I need you to do some math
A cylinder 50 centimeters
wide how deep is six
liters
BOWMAN (VO)
Eleven and three quarters
centimeters
He measures and scribes in the line
GALLAGHER
Somewhere Mr Plummer my
10th-grade math teacher is
cackling like a son-of-a-
bitch
Under which he slithers underneath opens the
main purge and fills the big steel bucket with
rocket fuel It looks just like the guy at
Texaco working on your car Lugs it away from
the Cosmos
GALLAGHER
Now what
BOWMAN (VO)
Launch diagnostics Avoid
pressing anything that says
ignition
He runs it - seals are good pumps are good
engines ready And the ignition power force
all 300 volts of it is dead as a doornail
The program suggests the replacement part
number And suggests he order it quickly
Checks again Answers the same He slumps
down sits beside SRM He aint going nowhere
Just sits there Cant move Cant speak
After all this hes fucked Stares out into
the distance Finally -
BOWMAN (VO)
Gallagher
GALLAGHER
No No go Theres enough
power to run the computer
but not enough to launch
BOWMAN (VO)
How much do you need
GALLAHER
I need 300 volts at six
amps And Ive 28 volts
running the computer
system Ignition batterys
stone cold
Beat
BOWMAN (VO)
Is there anything you can
use
GALLAGHER
Let me look around and see
if I see a high voltage
sourceNo just rocks
In fact everywhere I look
theres just fucking rocks
And more fucking rocks
Then as he tries not to break down -
GALLAGHER
Im gonna die here
INT ARES - FLIGHT DECK - NIGHT
Shes shook She knows hes right Not a damn
thing she can say Tries to maintain Barely
Looks up at one of the screens In four
minutes shes back on day side orbit And then
home

Gallagher steadies himself Picks the radio
back up Hes just babbling to keep himself
sane for a little while
GALLAGHER
I didnt come here to be a

Go home
Bowman tries to do the right thing Whatever
the hell that isTakes a breath wipes away
an errant tear tries to be calm for him
BOWMAN
Is there anything you want
me to do
GALLAGHER
(thinks then)
Tell all of Burchenals
women that they were the
only one Sell his horse to
somebody nice

BOWMAN
For you
GALLAGHER
No
Then burbling up unplanned
GALLAGHER

I shoulda kissed you
Theres a long beat Yeech He shouldnt have
said anything Then -
BOWMAN
Yeah You shoulda kissed
me
Gallagher cant believe it He could kick
himself
GALLAGHER
(to himself)
Okay This is like all the
worst parts of high school
math and the beautiful girl
youre too stupid to tell
youre madly in love with

EXT COSMOS SITE - NIGHT
Gallagher sits there And sits there Alone
beyond imagining Hope gone Just staring 1000
yards out into the distance Not looking at
anything Waiting to die Hes given up
And thenhe shakes himself out of it Just
feels foolish hes let himself go this far
Gets up Done with feeling sorry for himself
GALLAGHER

Well this cant get any

worse I guess
Grabs himself to stay warm Hops up and down
On one of the hops he ends up facing the
direction he came from Theres something
green and phosphorescent coming over the
ridge Theyve tracked him Footprint by
footprint
He looks closer Its not just the ridge
Theyre down in the valley with him The ones
in the front are back to translucent not
glowing anymore Theyre hungry for something
new He gets down low to silhouette them
against the sky There are already four or
five hundred thousand on this side of the
hill And theyre coming Faster

GALLAGHER

I guess I was wrong It can

get worse A lot fucking

worse

(shouts at them)

Forgive me if I dont feel

like getting eaten before I

die
They dont really respond Except the ones in
the front who rear up and seem to listen or
sniff for him And gnash their little
crystalline teeth They split now to come at
him from two sides Gallagher gets caught in a
dry-heave
GALLAGHER
Oh man
Sees the bucket of rocket fuel Lot closer to
them than it is to him Gathers his nerve
runs grabs the bucket Drags it twenty feet
back Then tilts it carefully pouring it out
in a ring around himself and the Cosmos Worms
closing in as he goes Leads a fuse of fuel
back towards him Lights it
It burns low and yellow in the oxygen-depleted
atmosphere Doesnt look like much Certainly
not a defence First worm gets near it
Unsure Bewildered Pulls back But his
compatriots are behind him still coming No
choice He advances AndPOOF VAPORIZES in
burst of red-orange as he touches the flame
And the nextAnd the next Like little
sparks Gallagher watches puzzled by
thisAnd then it hits Right as the ring of
flame is about to die out The main wave
touches the ring of fire Andthey do burn
And SCREAM Little WORM SCREAMS that
multiplied by tens and hundreds of thousands
begin to pierce the air
GALLAGHER
Thats for eating the Hab
And killing Cooper you
slimy worm fuckers
Rolling waves of flame Half plasma Flying
blobs of burning worms rain down like napalm
One lands on and torches the cobbled-together
radio Its so damn hot for a moment Gallagher
panics thinking everything might explode
Then it drops to embers and the wave burns
over the hill like a wild fire
Gallagher does a dance of triumph However
short-lived Then it hits him -
GALLAGHER
How do you burn like that
without oxygen
Theres a BLAST of flame from the far side of
the ridge that rattles rocks and Cosmos
Knocks him to the ground
GALLAGHER
Holy shitHoly shit
Gallagher stares with wonder over the hill He
figured it out Theres a couple of dozen
worms unburnt and thrown free He picks one
up looks at it
GALLAGHER
You motherfuckers stole all
the oxygen
(realizes)

And you can give it back

Motherfuckers I gotta tell

someone It could work It

could work here
He turns looks - the radio is still burning
He snatches it up scorches him Tries to put
it out Its cooked Deceased Hes
devastated Drops to his knees

GALLAGHER

No Not after all this

No
It aint gonna work ever again All the
shouting isnt gonna make a difference He
knows the answer he knows how to save the
species and theres no one he can tell
As he stumbles back onto his feet hes jarred
the switch that links to AMEEs display it
comes on shows
AMEES POV
The fire on the far side of the ridge Shes
approaching it And fast
BACK TO SCENE
Gallagher stares at it for a moment

GALLAGHER

My day is not getting

better is it
Theres a look on his face somewhere between
inspiration and fear Like hes got an idea
But it might be a really really bad one
EXT MARS SURFACE - NIGHT
AMEE skitters along Moving fast Climbs up
and ever so carefully peers over the
ridgeline
AMEES POV
The Cosmos down below And beneath it his
feet sticking out as he works on something
Gallagher He messed with her once she
recognizes him If she could bare her teeth
like an angry dog she would AMEE considers
for a moment Makes her move
EXT COSMOS SITE - NIGHT
She comes down the hill Twelve sixteen
twenty-foot strides Doing forty or fifty
miles an hour easy And all but silently
Gallagher hasnt yet responded And then shes
all the way to him She rears up to strike and

And Gallagher in his skivvies bursts up from
where hes buried himself in the sand
avenging entrenching tool high over his head
already swinging as AMEE wheels back around
andHe chops off both her eyes Sidesteps as
she rushes him blindly and backhands her in
her electronic Marine cranium from behind

Whatever hes hit the jolt stiffens his arm
throws him off The tool stays embedded She
runs headlong into the Cosmos Smashes
stumbles falls And before she can get back
up to her feetHe wraps the sleeve of his
shirt around his hand rescues the entrenching
tool and deals a death stroke to the silver
arachnid
GALLAGHER
Robust real-time response
to the environment my
butt
Gallagher grabs his satchel of tools and
begins to unbolt her as fast as he can Checks
his watch Whatever hes racing theres only
minutes to go
Deep within the electronic entrails of AMEE
he dredges up her Esource Size of a soda can
POWER CELL that runs her for year anda half
HUMS as he removes it from its shielded
container Its 280 volts
GALLAGHER
Work
He rips open a panel on the Cosmos yanks out
the dead cell and hooks the new one in It
doesnt fit Hes got nothing left but a
couple of wrenches and a tube of epoxy Glues
it in place
Runs the launch Diagnostics on his HCC It
flickers goes to yellow flashes on and off
to green He yanks back on his suit Grabs a
handful of the uncharred worms and seals them
in the container that held the Esource
Stuffs it in a side pocket Looks at the top
of SRV Wedges himself under some cables and
wiring on the top
GALLAGHER
This oughta be interesting
Checks his watch Its now or never
EXT ARES - DAY
The ship is just about to enter the darkside
INT ARES - FLIGHT DECK - DAY
Bowmans got her suit on Screens show the
apogee launch and a slingshot around the
backside
BOWMAN
Houston this is Ares I am
go for return ignition
SKAVLEM (VO)
Copy that Ares you are go
for return
She slides into the darkness
EXT COSMOS SITE - NIGHT
Gallagher watches the second hand come around
takes a deep breath and
GALLAGHER
Fuck you Mars
Slaps the helmet shut Hits ignition
Nothing happens Then the GRINDING of thirty-
year-old PUMPS And then a GIANT flaming ROAR
And it launches

Gallagher epoxied to the top is pinned flat
Face squashes eyes bulge Ship starts to glow
friction Thirty-year-old paint chips off like
tiny shooting stars burning away as this
reverse comet leaves the atmosphere

We can hear him roaring at the top of his
lungs as the ROCKET BLOWS by and

MARS
pulls away in the bg Rapidly contracting
FROM FILLING the FRAME TO a red circle below
Atmosphere thins the friction and flame
decrease and disappear

SKY
turns from deep red to maroon to black as he
blows through the clouds into the outer
reaches of the Mars atmosphere and beyond The
ENGINES STOP Fuels expended And

Quiet He comes skittering back from the edge
of blacking out He floats silently orbiting
the planet slowing receding into the
distance Until hesgone

EXT ARES - NIGHT

We see Bowman THROUGH the front viewport
Unhurried Making the last of her
preparations Downhearted and slow Then -
INT ARES - FLIGHT DECK - NIGHT

Shes strapped in now Counter on a screen is
ticking down 13 12 11She tries to allay
her horror at what shes doing Reaches for
the mike

BOWMAN
Robby
(no answer)

If you can still hear

meIm so sorry And I

shoulda just kissed you
EXT COSMOS SITE
Radio three-quarters cooked lays there on
the still-smoking ground
INT ARES - FLIGHT DECK - NIGHT
Countdown continues Nine eight sevenThen
just breaking the horizon way out in front of
her a shiny metallic speck breaches into the
light Its a man glued to thirty-year-old
spacecraft Four threeShe slams down an
abort button as with the other hand she
twists the radio over to the suit-to-suit
frequency

BOWMAN
Gallagher
No response
EXT COSMOS
Gallagher is sucking on a few useless raspy
breaths He can see her ten kilometers away
Barely hanging on
GALLAGHER
No Air
INT MISSION CONTROL - NIGHT
They stare up at the screen awaiting her
return ignition
SKAVLEM
She should be clearing
Starting the burn
Shes not showing Still not showing And
then
SCHLISSEL
Theres secondary object in
orbit
INT ARES - FLIGHT DECK
Bowman has flipped a set of
joystickscollectives out from underneath the
dash in front of her Shes shouting at the
computer
BOWMAN
Reroute Orbital
maneuvering Power the OMS
power the RCS I need
roll pitch yaw X Y Z
Now Goddammit now
INT MISSION CONTROL - NIGHT
Theyve figured out whats up Some are
thrilled others are freaked
LOWENTHAL
No No theres no fuel for
maneuvering Stop her
Skavlem shakes his head Not a chance Nor
would she listen to him
BOROKOVSKI
She is going to burn fuel
to rescue this man without
enough to come home
(very Russian of
her)
I like this girl
INT ARES - FLIGHT DECK
Which is exactly what she does
BOWMAN
I want ten milliliter
bursts Now
And puff puff puff
EXT MARS ORBIT - NIGHT
Ares bit by bit dives down into a smaller
orbit to catch up with the Cosmos
INT ARES - FLIGHT DECK
Bowman grabs the whole orbital maneuvering
assembly yanks it out of the flight deck
turns and rushes from the sphere
EXT COSMOS - ORBIT - DAY
As he watches it come closer hes depleted
what little air there was in the suit And
starts to die
INT ARES - MEV DECK - DAY
Its now an empty docking port Bowman careens
in No artificial gravity here Floats as she
shouts at the computer
BOWMAN
I want a 180 degree Now
EXT ARES - ORBIT - DAY
Puff puffThe ship turns end over end
As
INT ARES - MEV DECK
Kate plugs the maneuvering deck in with one
hand slaps an oxygen bottle on and her helmet
shut
BOWMAN
Seal this level Open the
dock
Clips herself in just in time as the DOORS
behind her SLAM shut and the giant doors in
front of her open Air purges And in front of
her 300 yards away is the Cosmos
BOWMAN
Gallagher Gallagher
He doesnt respond
EXT COSMOS - CLOSE ON HIM
Because hes unconscious or dead His head
lolls there
INT ARES - MEV DECK
Theres no time left for subtlety Bowman
yanks a device off the wall It looks like a
40mm rifle with a power cable Points it at
him Triggers it Its a huge laser pointer
Lights him up Shouts to the computer
BOWMAN
Hard Dock
The ship pauses like its thinking And
refuses
ANNUNCIATOR (VO)
Object out of range
Emergency braking will
commence in seven seconds
Ares turns off the pointer Kate throws it
angrily aside Theres a linear acceleration
track on the side of the wall with a line
thrower attached She clips in Grabs
something the size of a medicine ball with
seventy nozzles sticking out of it in her free
hand And shouts -
BOWMAN
Last acquisition Line
release Full velocity
And it does The linear accelerator wrenches
her violently along the track and hurls her
into space REEL and a line behind her WHIR
Its like the worlds largest angler has cast
her into the void
EXT ORBIT - DAY
Tumbling she half-regains her bearing holds
out the mini-thrust ball Shouts something at
it FIRES Drags her by the arm towards
Cosmos She hits it Twisting flailing way
too hard Half knocks herself out Recovers
clips in with the tether on her suit
Gallagher is completely insensate
She shouts something in the silence we cant
hear The reel in the ship starts to spin So
damn fast its smoking
The Cosmos is reeled in oscillating wildly at
the end of the line The Ares giant by
comparison is about to swallow up the tiny
SRM and its two passengers At 45 mph
INTEXT ARES - MEV DECK
Dock comes careening at them Theyre both
going to be squashed like bugs
Bowman slashes loose the line And fires
everything left in the portable thrust engine
at once Blue plasma flares Her arm is
wrenched wildly pulled from its socket
But
The Cosmos spins 180 degrees as they plunge
through the opening of the port into the Ares
Theyre on the lee side as the Cosmos hits the
far side of the dock like a freight train
BOWMAN
Seal Emergency atmosphere
Now
The DOCKING DOORS SLAM SHUT The room is
buffeted in white mist She grabs an emergency
cutting tool hooks it into the front of
Gallaghers suit Rips it open from stem to
stern Hes limp unresponsive
BOWMAN
No Not after all that
dammit No
She checks he has no pulse
BOWMAN
Dammit no
A first aid station is bolted into the wall
She grabs him by the shirtfront launches them
over there Takes out a pair of pre-gummed
HEART PADDLES slaps them onto his chest and
FIRES them
Gallagher is thrown entirely across the room
by the current Slams into the far wall Opens
his eyes Starts to breathe
GALLAGHER
Hey I knew you wouldnt
leave without me
(beat)
You promised
INT MISSION CONTROL - NIGHT
Theyre all stunned And freaked Theyve got
a serious problem now
BOWMAN (VO)
Mission Control This is
Ares Recovered ground
crew Request recalc and
reconfiguration for return
flight Orbit is stable but
diminished
The scientists have been figuring madly And
they dont like what theyre coming up with
LOWENTHAL
We can get em back
Slowly Fifty extra days
And were not going to be
able to support food and
and air for two people
Russert nods Motions to Skavlem
INT ARES - FLIGHT DECK - DAY
Bowman and Gallagher listen as -
SKAVLEM (VO)
that travel has been
increased by approximate
two months Concern is that
available life support is
untenable for duration and
current crew strength
Gallaghers unimpressed Worms tried to eat
him robots tried to kill him and theyre
worried about this Feh
GALLAGHER
Scientists Scientists sent
us here Scientists figured
the whole thing out with
Mars I hate to bring this
up but they got us into
this whole mess in the
first place Hell they
shouldnt be allowed to
drive cause they miss the
turnoff as they consider
the ramifications of the
internal combustion engine
He picks up the mike

GALLAGHER

Hey guys How bout we

come about halfway home and

you send a ship with air

and food and stuff to meet

us In the middle And we

dont have to get all the

way back Huh
INT MISSION CONTROL - NIGHT
Schlissel nods Thatd work As Russert
Lowenthal and the big guys start to talk this
over Borokovski motions to Schlissel and his
new friend the Tech
BOROKOVSKI
I know where there is a
rocket in Uzbeckistan For
cheap A friend of mine has
kept it
INT ARES - FLIGHT DECK - DAY
OUT the window Mars drifts by in the view
port Bowman looks at it kinda sadly
BOWMAN
So much for saving
humankind and living on
Mars I guess the worms
took care of that
GALLAGHER
The worms are not our
enemy Theyre our friends
Hes pulled the container out of his pocket
Unscrews it to show her the little slimy
monsters She recoils in horror
BOWMAN
You brought them back Are
you insane
GALLAGHER
Its okay Im pretty sure
they dont like titanium
(then)
Were gonna live On Mars
Hell maybe even back on
Earth Maybe anywhere we
want And the reason were
gonna live is the damn
worms Yeah they ate all
the algae and damn near
everything else but they
store and excrete oxygen
She finds this hard to believe But he
explains
GALLAGHER
ats why we could
reathe You should have
een these suckers burn
en they went up I had
ome time to think about
is I was in orbit for
ix minutes before you
ound me I shoulda been
ead But the air locked in
e suit was almost pure
02 Cause of the worms We
didnt just find a new
place to live on we may
have saved our old one
Toxic waste theyll eat
it Poisonous landfills
theyll eat it
Shes still trying to absorb all this Its
been a long couple of days

tTAamMntneEUDoOH
GALLAGHER
Gods got a sense of humor
Hes giving us another
chance If we can all get
along this time Burchenal
knew somewhere that it
wasnt the science it was
about having something to
believe in Bud always
knew Wonders of the deep
We just had to go to Mars
to remind ourselves of what
we should have been able to
see back on Earth Its not
all about us We cant kill
everything and survive

Bowman looks back at Mars Astounded
Believes

BOWMAN
You wanna tell them back on
Earth the species is saved
and were gonna live

GALLAGHER
How should I know Im the
janitor

(then)

Look CommanderI just
fought off half a million
screaming nematodes and a
killer robot and glued
myself onto a rocket to get
offa Mars and I was

wondering
BOWMAN
If you could kiss me
GALLAGHER
Yeah
BOWMAN
Yeah

He does She kisses him back They continue
for a long damn time Finally they break
apart and

BOWMAN
Its an extra fifty days
back

GALLAGHER

Gee wonder what well find
to do with ourselves
As she starts to laugh

FADE
OUT
