Just a Job to Do

You wanna be a detective Heres what you

do Take a trusted friend and imagine the

worst thing the most despicable thing the

thing it would never even cross their minds

to do Then assume theyve already done it

twice
Joseph R Hallenbeck
Private Investigator

When you consider that a career in pro foot-
ball means maybe ten years after which you
got no legs left and during which youre a
painkiller drug addict a million a year
sounds about right So when people bitch
at me about the money I made I have a pat
response Go fuck yourself

AERIAL SHOT - SNOWSTORM

OVER Chicago Illinois as the CAMERA SPIRALS DOWN TOWARD
a teeming football stadium We hear crowd noise and
marching band music deafeningly loud as we SUPERIMPOSE

SOLDIER FIELD CHICAGO NOVEMBER 14

INT ANNOUNCERS BOOTH
The BROADCAST TEAM huddles inside the quilted jackets
squinting through the snow Speaking into headset mikes
ANNOUNCER

Good afternoon and welcome to

Soldier Field Chicago site of

todays confrontation between the

LA Stallions and the Chicago

Bears This is Vern Lindquist

with Terry Bradshaw and yes my

friends it is that cold

INT LOCKER ROOM - SAME TIME
Billy Cole sits alone in front of his locker
Eyes glazed Face bathed in sweat
He takes a bottle of pills from the locker Pops three
Hisses a stream of air through his teeth as we --
CUT TO

EXT FOOTBALL FIELD - DAY (FOURTH QUARTER)
A deafening CRUNCH as a defensive back hammers a wide
receiver nearly decapitates him The ball rolls free
The back recovers it
ANNOUNCER (VO)
Big Ray Walton puts a

devastating hit on Bricmont so

Chicago turns over the ball with a

minute and forty seconds left

EXT SIDELINES - SAME TIME
The injured player goes by on a stretcher moaning
Cheerleaders jump and frolic

BILLY COLE
gets up off the bench The rest of the offensive unit
sprints onto the field Cole walks Straight ahead
eyes front Like a robot His HEARTBEAT THUDS on the
soundtrack
COLOR MAN (VO)

And so LA has a chance to ice

the game no pun intended And

you gotta be thinking give the

ball to Billy Cole He has had an

outstanding day racking up 138

yards against a tough defense

DOWN ON FIELD
The huddle breaks
The LA team trudges through the snow to the line of
scrimmage

Cole adopts a three-point stance

Everything happens in hyper-real SLOW MOTION

The snow falls The receivers breeze past in motion to
begin their patterns Moving like gazelles

Coles fingers paw the cold earth Gouging it

He is like a spring Coiled and ready

The ball is snapped

Turf and snow Erupting

A firecracker series of POPS as linemen collide

Legs churning

The ball floats through the snowy air Pitch-out to
Cole
He takes it on the run Tucks it under his arm
Behind him the quarterback bites the dust leveled
Cole turns the corner Picks up a blocker
Feet pounding Arms pumping
Up ahead the free safety barrels toward him Low and
hard
Cole does not blink He reaches beneath his jersey
Pulls out a GUN
Pumps THREE SHOTS into the free safetys head

The bullets go straight through On the back of his
helmet

A mixture of blood and fiberglass

Cole keeps going jogging for the end zone

Around him sound Fury Impact Confusion

Another defensive back Straight ahead

Reacts with almost comical terror Dives to one side
Cole FIRES Blows out the guys knee Ends a career
Keeps going

We are now in full-scale panic

The players are fleeing the field Shouts Pandemonium
A few brave men gather around the fallen players

POLICE

are on the field now Running full out Theyve got
riot guns cocked and locked Sprinting through the
snow

Cole crosses the goal line Touchdown
Drops the ball
Turns facing the cops His eyes are insane

The crowd is screaming People are running back and

forth like extras in the Keystone Cops

The first TWO BLASTS from the cops RIOT GUNS go high and
wide One SHOT BLOWS APART the base of the goalpost
The forty-foot-high monument pitches over collapsing
like a wounded giant Lands in a shower of snow and ice
Cole is oblivious to the bars crashing around him He
smiles and says

COLE
Im going to Disneyland
Puts the GUN to his helmet FIRES

We SUPERIMPOSE the legend

WEST LOS ANGELES CALIFORNIA DECEMBER 20
Good morning Mr and Mrs America and all the ships at
sea Welcome to another lackluster morning in Southern
California Palm trees limp Windless silence 80
degrees at 800 AM
CAMERA CRANES DOWN PAST a huge rotting billboard On

HOHE

ANOTHER ANGLE

Inside the car a lone man is asleep arms akimbo
Sprawled across the seat Half-empty bottle of Seagrams
VO RADIO on playing tinny JAZZ music

Picture the tiredest meanest grouchiest son of a bitch
self-hating loser you can

Now give him a two-year-old suit from C and R Clothing
Such is the aforementioned HALLENBECK

ANOTHER ANGLE

THREE neighborhood KIDS have gathered around the car
Enjoying the spectacle of a sleeping drunk

One tosses a baseball from hand to hand One picks his

nose

KID 1
Dudes trashed
KID 2
Shit we should do something to
him
Kid 3 continues mining for nose eggs It looks like his
entire fist is up there Pause then
KID 3
I know where theres a dead
squirrel

ANOTHER ANGLE - BUNDLE OF PAPER TOWELS - SOME MINUTES
LATER

with a tail sticking out

The youngest Kid holds it aloft reverently

Looks in the open car window at Hallenbeck

Still snoozing Dead to the world
KID 1
Do it
They heave the squirrel into the car and run away
A pause Another pause The sprinkler goes round

Nothing happens

ANOTHER ANGLE
Hallenbeck snores The mashed squirrel perches on his
chest A shadow falls across him as --

KIDS
return scratching their heads Staring in at him
KID 2
Goddamn Dudes trashed
KID 3
Take his bottle
Kid 1 smiles nervously Reaches in with infinite
patience

Trembling hand inches closer and closer --
And closes on the bottle as without warning --

HALLENBECK
sits bolt upright and grabs the Kid and stuffs a 38
revolver in the Kids face and cocks it
HALLENBECK
Hey motherfucker
The Kid of course shrieks
And the light of sanity dawns in Hallenbecks eyes
He sucks in a deep breath Releases the struggling Kid
Swears under his breath Watches the boys flee in
terror Notices a dead squirrel in his lap Scowls
Heaves it out the window Pumps a Camel into his mouth
Lights it Rescues the bottle of Seagrams

Thus begins his morning
He opens the car door The sprinkler douses him
He gets out Stands on the lawn
One of the Kids the toughest one is standing on the
sidewalk
KID 3
Im not scared
Hallenbeck scowls

HALLENBECK
Youre on my property kid
KID 3
Sidewalk belongs to the
government
Hallenbeck stares at him Smiles weakly
HALLENBECK

Excuse me
He leans over and vomits on the lawn
One hand gripping the car fender
The sprinkler goes round and round

EXT MALIBU BEACH FRONT - MORNING

A redwood beach house mellow in the morning sun

There was a party here last night

Banners Balloons and streamers Tawdry in the light of
day

INT BEACH HOUSE - SAME TIME

A plush bedroom Sun streams in the window

A YOUNG MAN sits straddling a backwards chair Bare-
foot bare-chested Blond hair perfect tan

He is nursing a beer Smoking and staring at --

BED

where a tawny golden girl lies serene and innocent
Like a sleeping kitten Rumpled sheets one breast
exposed No tan line
The man takes a drag off the cigarette studies the
sleeping girl Meet Jimmy Dix Twenty-seven years old
former National League heartthrob
He shakes his head and mutters
JIMMY (YOUNG MAN)

Jesus kid if only you werent so

He gets up and goes into the head Pulls out a glass
vial Dips a coke spoon with practiced ease Sucks it
up a nostril
For one moment he catches his own eye in the mirror

FLASH CUT TO

FLASHBACK - FOOTBALL FIELD
Seventy thousand people screaming

BACK TO PRESENT
Alone in the bathroom leaning on the counter Head

INT WEST LA BUNGALOW - MORNING

Hallenbeck opens the door and shambles in

Dark Depressing Sprawl of furniture Stack after
stack of sports magazines Drop all your belongings out
of a plane They will land like this

He flicks on the light Crosses to the couch and flops
down Plucks a bottle of aspirin from an end table
Next to the bottle we see --

TWO FRAMED PHOTOGRAPHS

In the other the President of the United States presents
Hallenbeck with a medal They are both smiling beneath

Jimmys eyes are smoldering He steps to the right
Casually scoops up a football lying on the deck

JIMMY
Last chance Ray

RAY

JIMMY

Fine

Jimmy turns as if to walk away

Instead he spins back and launches the football

It sings thats how hard he throws it And when it
smacks Ray in the face something breaks It aint the
ball

The big man howls Clutching his flattened nose

The girl comes up for air Gagging and choking

Jimmy is at her side instantly Pulls her out of the
water

JIMMY
Get out of here Go
She goes He leans over and grabs Ray by the hair
The guy is bleeding Delirious
Jimmy yanks until their faces are inches apart

Her body is exquisite She moves like breath Her eyes

ANGLE ON STAGE
Onstage the MUSIC GRINDS TO a CLOSE as Cory dispenses
with the last of her clothing Strikes a pose to wild
applause and we HOLD ON her radiant beauty and --

CUT TO
INT DINGY DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

Cory and Jimmy are engaged in very hot sex

This is not a love scene this is a sex scene
Sigh Im not even going to attempt to write this
quote-unquote steamy scene here for several good
reasons

A) The things that I find steamy are none of your damn
business Jack in addition to which --
B) The two actors involved will no doubt have wonderful

highly athletic ideas which manage to elude most
fat-assed writers anyhow and finally --
C) My mother reads this shit So there
(PS I think we lost her back at the Jacuzzi blowjob
scene)

Suffice to say they fog the screen
At last Jimmy rolls over and pours champagne into two
crystal glasses Lifts one in a toast

JIMMY

INT BACKSTAGE CORRIDOR - SAME TIME

Joe Hallenbeck is pounding an already-dented cigarette
machine No dice It has eaten his money He shakes

his head muttering

Looks at his watch Looks at the dressing room door
Shakes his head again Walks to the end of the corridor
Goes through the fire door Out into

EXT PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS ACTION
Starry moonlit night A chill breeze Joe draws a
breath
In front of him on the wall of the club is a poster
BAYNARD FOR SENATE it reads Above the logo a picture
of a benevolent-looking gray-haired man
Hallenbeck regards it balefully
HALLENBECK

I didnt vote for you you bastard
He looks away and suddenly notices something on the
ground
A half-smoked cigarette butt
Just sitting there
Joe stares at it Thinks it over
Starts to walk away Stops
HALLENBECK
Youre a fuckin lowlife Joe
( )

He bends to pick up the butt
A steel sap whistles over his head missing by inches
Hallenbeck spins startled Reflexively lashes out with
a flattened palm Misses chops the air
Two more men behind him Nowhere to go
A sap pops him behind the left ear A sickening thud
The world spins out of focus He goes down
Hits the pavement like a ton of bricks
Rolls over staring up
Vision muddy indistinct

HALLENBECKS POV

Three silhouettes hover over him backlit by streetlamps
Their voices are fuzzy

HITMAN 1
Thats him He was with her
HITMAN 2
Shit hes packing What should
we do
HITMAN 3
Get him away from here Then kill
him
HITMAN 2
Theres no contract for him
HITMAN 3
Then do it for free Just do it
elsewhere

The men disperse One of them drags Joe to his feet
A stocky crag-faced man He jams a silenced pistol
in Joes kidney and points him toward a vacant lot
nearby
HITMAN 2
Start walking Im right behind
you

ANOTHER ANGLE
The two other Hitmen return to their gray late-model
sedan Climb into the car and sit watching the
nightclub
Waiting

EXT VACANT LOT - NIGHT

A rusty chain-link fence separates the lot from the boule-

vard Choked with weeds Broken glass A rusted-out car
A towering billboard looms overhead inviting people to
drink Scotch or get laid its hard to tell

Hallenbeck staggers drunkenly across the lot

The crag-faced man follows behind him

CRAG-FACE (HITMAN 2)

Wrong place at the wrong time

buddy thats all it is Just

want you to know its nothing

personal

HALLENBECK
Thats what you think Last night
I fucked your wife
The gunman cracks up Hallenbeck grins drunkenly
CRAG-FACE
Oh you did huh Howd you know
it was my wife
HALLENBECK
She said her husband was a
greaseball with bad breath
The guy cracks up again
CRAG-FACE
Youre pretty cool for a guy gonna
take a bullet

HALLENBECK
After fucking your wife Ill take
two
The hitman wheezes laughter Joe just grins
CRAG-FACE

Youre a funny guy Its a shame

to take you off Here kneel down
HALLENBECK

Are you kidding We barely know

each other

The hitman is now giggling shaking his head

CRAG-FACE

This is wild I never shot no

funny guy before

HALLENBECK
You need a special funny bullet

CRAG-FACE
Come on cut it out Head or chest

HALLENBECK

Thats what your wife said
CRAG-FACE
Would you quit with the wife
Enough is enough

HALLENBECK
Ask me how fat she is

CRAG-FACE
How fat is she

HALLENBECK
Shes so fat I had to roll her in
flour and look for the wet spot
You wanna fuck her you gotta slap
her thigh and ride the wave in

(the hitman loses it)

Like the Pillsbury doughboy except
when you poke her in the stomach
she farts I got a buddy hes an
archaeologist organized an
expedition to her chin They got
lost in her nasal hair But
seriously her eyes are like the
streets of Paris crossed
Theyre so crossed when she cries
the tears run down her back
Shes got back-tearia

CRAG-FACE
(cant stop laughing)

Oh thats awful Buddy youre a

fucking rio --
From a kneeling position Hallenbeck flings a handful of
gravel at the mans eyes
The man cries out Stumbles backward
And Hallenbeck moves like a coiled spring Not drunk at
all He takes the broken bottle hes been clutching and
cuts the guys throat like a knife through butter
The hitman stands with a shocked look on his face
Blood bubbling
FIRES the GUN once into the ground Drops it from nerve-
less fingers Stares at Hallenbeck aghast

( )

CRAG-FACE
Bastard
Hallenbeck meets his gaze A savage feral gleam in his
eye
HALLENBECK

And then some
The guy pitches over dead
Hallenbeck kneels beside him
Retrieves his 38 holsters it Slips the hitmans pistol
into his waistband

HALLENBECK
Im playing Tahoe on the 15th
He takes off running

EXT STRIP CLUB - NIGHT
Cory and Jimmy emerge from the club into the parking lot
She scans the area shaking her head
CORY
I cant believe it The bastard
split on me
(sighs)
Im staying at a motel for a couple
days Will you follow me
JIMMY
Sure

He heads for his car

ANOTHER ANGLE

The Hitmen wait in the darkened sedan
Watching Jimmy and Cory

The driver keys the ignition Starts the car
In his lap is an automatic rifle

EXT BOULEVARD - NIGHT
Joe Hallenbeck is running full out

Headlong down the sidewalk Gasping for breath
HALLENBECK
Move
( )

He slams into a man Knocks him flat Groceries fly
Joe doesnt care He stumbles Keeps going
EXT NIGHTTIME STREET - SAME TIME
Jimmy Dix is behind the wheel of a silver Jag
Cory is driving a spanking new Ford Fiero
Jimmy follows behind Cory watchdogging Humming with
JOE COCKER on the RADIO
Cory comes to a red light Pauses Turns right onto a

sidestreet
Jimmy slows pausing at the intersection

GRAY SEDAN
passes Jimmy Accelerating ENGINE REVVING
Jimmy only gets one glimpse into the passing car
Its enough
Everyone inside is armed to the teeth
The SEDAN ROARS around the corner cutting in front of
Jimmy
JIMMY
Oh God This is a hit this is a
fucking hit

GRAY SEDAN
comes up behind Cory Comes up fast
Rams her car Metal crumples Meanwhile

JIMMY

frantically floors the pedal of his Jag pops the clutch
-- And stalls out

He roars with anger

Flings open the door

Leaps out and runs forward screaming

JIMMY
Cory get out of there
Too late Cory is already out of her car yelling
CORY
Hey cant you fucking drive

Her eyes go wide with shock
The Hitmen burst from their car OPEN UP on full auto

Cory is cut down Blown backward over the hood of her
Ford Flung to the street
JIMMY

Oh Gooood
And without missing a beat the Hitmen turn --
And OPEN FIRE on Jimmy
He takes a running start
Clears the hood of his Jag in a single leap
BULLETS DICE the metal behind him

He lands hard Sucks the ground Huddled behind his
car as

TWO HITMEN

move toward him triggering THREE SHOT BURSTS

The kid is dead meat Or so it seems until without
warning --

JOE HALLENBECK

charges into the intersection Screaming bloody murder
Hes got a GUN in each fist and both are BLAZING

One Hitman dies immediately
Dances like a puppet racked by gunfire
Bullets go through him SHATTER the sedans WINDSHIELD

The second Hitman turns and OPENS UP on Hallenbeck
Too late Joe rolls behind a mailbox

BULLETS chase him blowing apart the metal box

The Hitman swears Turns running for the sedan

He knows when a getaway is in order

Just one problem He forgot about Jimmy Dix

A SCREECH of TIRES

As Jimmys Jag slews around the corner laying rubber
Rockets toward the Hitman pins him in its headlights --
The Hitman screams as Jimmy plows through him --

And CRUNCHES into the gray sedan

Shatters the Hitman between the two cars
And holy Christ the guys still alive
Pinned like a butterfly legs broken
He raises his rifle screaming
Jimmy dives flat on the front seat The WINDSHIELD ERUPTS
The Hitman Still pinned Still screaming
He FIRES SHOT AFTER SHOT into Jimmys car
Hallenbeck walks up behind him
Puts a BULLET in his head He stops screaming

JIMMY
is still huddled on the front seat in a sea of broken

glass Hallenbeck walks up leans in the window
HALLENBECK

Hey
(as Jimmy looks up)
Back up

ANOTHER ANGLE

Jimmy puts it in reverse The car backs up
Steam pouring from the crumpled hood

The Hitman now freed collapses to the street
Like a sack of flour

Hallenbeck limps toward him wheezing
He stops as

MOTEL MANAGER

stands outside a door marked OFFICE

Holding a pump action shotgun leveled at Hallenbeck
Hallenbeck nods at the bodies in the street
HALLENBECK

Its all over compadre

MANAGER
Get off my property mister

HALLENBECK
(scowls)

Sidewalk belongs to the government
He turns and looks at Jimmy The kid is in pain
Staring at Corys bullet-riddled body Eyes glazed
Hallenbeck says nothing He crosses to the shattered
Hitman Kneels down fishes through the guys coat
pockets Comes up with a bloody pack of cigarettes
Extracts one Lights it
SIRENS fill the air
And Jimmy snaps out of it long enough to reach into his
coat -- Takes out the vial of coke Ditches it
Drops it down a sewer grating out of sight
No one sees him do it

POLICE CRUISERS
come SQUEALING up flashers turning
Surrounding Jimmy who stands head down and motionless --
And Joe who smokes and looks at the moon
CUT TO

INT POLICE STATION - NIGHT

SERGEANT BENJAMIN BESSALO sits behind his desk scanning

a stack of typed pages A tired-looking cop named McCASKEY
lounges in the doorway A Christmas tree in the corner

Through the glass window we can see Hallenbeck and Jimmy

Outside the office Hallenbeck and Jimmy are perched side
by side on a wooden bench Jimmy is crumpling pieces of
paper and tossing them at a wastebasket He throws with

unerring accuracy Beside him Hallenbeck frowns

INT COTTAGE

Jimmy opens the door Flips on the lights Stops in
his tracks

The room has been systematically torn to pieces

A knife has been used to rip open the couch

Broken furniture shredded clothing Everywhere

It looks like a combat zone

Hallenbeck starts inspecting the wreckage

INT CLUTTERED BATHROOM
Jimmy enters and shuts the door behind him
He scans the floor covered with clothes bottles etc
Picks up a carelessly discarded can of Right Guard
deodorant
Turns it upside down and unscrews the bottom
Inside the can is hollow and empty The perfect hiding
place
Jimmy heaves a sigh of relief Removes a little plastic
Baggie filled with white powder Stashes it in his
shorts
Starts to replace the lid Stops Frowns
Reaches into the can a second time --
And pulls out a yellow envelope
He looks at it perplexed
Puts it in his pocket Replaces the lid Tosses the can
on the floor Flushes the toilet Leaves

INT LIVING ROOM
Hallenbeck meanwhile is prowling the living room

He sprints across the sidewalk and yanks Jimmy out of the
drivers seat before he can key the ignition

JIMMY
Ouch -- Whats your problem

ANOTHER ANGLE
Hallenbeck kneels and peers under the car

Swears softly as he sees two thin copper wires glinting
in the moonlight
HALLENBECK
They used a car bomb on Mike it

(stands)
Except they wired the wrong car
Jimmy pales noticeably
JIMMY
Oh Shit Oh Jeez
Hallenbeck claps him on the back
HALLENBECK

He strolls toward his Plymouth whistling
Cheerfully unaffected
Jimmy catches his breath Swallows hard
Turns and bumps into Hallenbeck coming back the other
way
JIMMY

Hallenbeck brandishes a pair of wire-cutters
HALLENBECK
Gotta disconnect the fucker
JIMMY
Whoa Hold on Um shouldnt we

rings out suddenly from the darkness
VOICE (0S)
Hold it right there gentlemen
They stop Slowly they turn

TWO MEN

are approaching from out of the trees

One holds a flashlight trained on Hallenbeck and Jimmy
The other carries a silenced Beretta

JIMMY
Is it the cops
HALLENBECK
No Jimmy Its not the cops
( )

Working quickly Hallenbeck tapes the bomb to the inside
of the truck lid Slams it shut Turns facing the new
arrivals
The MEN wear tailored suits with matching ties
One is tall and lean The other is a bruiser short and
stout They both have the seasoned look of professional
mob hitters
The Taller Man speaks gun held rock steady
TALL MAN

( )

Jake slips on a pair of brass knuckles
Steps up and delivers a looping right to Hallenbecks
face A sickening crunch A two inch gash streams blood
Jake relieves Hallenbeck of his gun
TALL MAN
Perhaps we can dispense with the
fun and games now yes
Jimmy rushes forward snarling The Beretta swivels
Jimmy stops the gun aimed at his gut

HALLENBECK
(gasping)
Easy Jim All they want is

TALL MAN

Another fist to the head Hallenbeck grunts Spits more
blood
JIMMY

HALLENBECK

The Tall Man turns and eyes Jimmy
TALL MAN

Whatever you say Jake
The Short Man steps away from Hallenbeck Turns and
launches a kick at Jimmys groin Connects The kid
drops to the ground retching

TALL MAN
(sighs)
Ah my young friend I neglected
to tell you that Jake attacks his

JIMMY

inventor of Scrabble
TALL MAN

Jake steps forward

HALLENBECK

Hallenbeck meets the Tall Mans gaze Speaks softly
HALLENBECK

Jimmy stumbles to his feet Looks at the Tall Man
TALL MAN

Slow and easy

Jimmy takes out the car keys Crosses to Hallenbeck
Gives him the keys

HALLENBECK
The evidence is in the trunk
TALL MAN

( )

Hallenbeck smiles Shakes his head
HALLENBECK

He turns and throws the keys as far as he can
They fall out of sight behind a cottage
HALLENBECK
Oops I guess nobody gets it
TALL MAN

You dumb bastard youre going to

trunk

Jake steps forward drawing a 38 silenced pistol
He is going to shoot open the lock

ANGLE ON HALLENBECK

This is what hes been waiting for He tenses looking
to one side next to him is a sloping hillside angling
down and away He grips Jimmys wrist signalling to get

ready
Jake raises the PISTOL Take aim at the lock and FIRES
The SHOT is SILENCED What follows is not

Because the bullet blows through the trunk --
And hits three sticks of live dynamite

SERIES OF SHOTS

Hallenbeck is already moving pitching to one side
throwing himself and Jimmy down the hillside

The night lights up like a SUNBURST

A tower of fire

Climbs up and outward from the car

The TRUNK LID is BLOWN fifty feet in the air

The tires are pulped

GLASS SPRAYS for fifty yards in every direction

And most importantly both hitmen are engulfed in
flame
( )

SOUND Fury
Flames rolling skyward

TINKLE of raining GLASS

Bits of falling metal

All in all a helluva blast and meanwhile

JIMMY AND JOE

continue to careen down the hillside

Bouncing like rag puppets Out of control

Lurch to stop at the bottom

Covered head to toe with dirt Bruised Bloody
Alive

They lie side by side sucking air --

Until they both hear an odd noise
The sound of CRUMPLING METAL
The sound is GETTING LOUDER
They both crane their necks in time to see --
The flaming car tumbling end over end
Coming down the hill
Heading straight for them
JIMMY
Jesus fucking Christ

They both dive for cover out of the way

Barely make it

The CAR plows past them in a shower of dirt
CRUMPLING Heaving Spitting fire

Finally SLAMS to a halt against a palm tree
Burns

The night is filled with SHOUTS and CURSES

The sound of DOORS OPENING The crackle of flames

ON GROUND
Joe rolls over Looks at Jimmy Jimmy looks at Joe
( )

HALLENBECK
You alive
JIMMY

Dont know yet
They crawl to their feet inspecting for broken bones
JIMMY

HALLENBECK

as he whirls glaring at Joe Hallenbeck who is seated

photograph Two men having lunch together on a secluded
patio
Both are older distinguished-looking
Joe suddenly looks very pale

Hallenbeck nervously lights a cigarette
Stares straight ahead through the windshield Begins to
talk
HALLENBECK
When I was thirty I was on the
Presidents personal security
force Once night I was on the
way home from a late session Im
on the highway just outside of
Georgetown when I see something
up ahead

MEMORY FLASH
Another time Another night

A younger-looking Hallenbeck

Rugged features Clipped military haircut
He is driving
Down a turnpike squinting through dense evening mist
Up ahead a shape materializes out of the fog

WRECKED CAR

is lying upside down in a pool of shattered glass
He SCREECHES to a stop

ANOTHER ANGLE

In a dream-like SLOW MOTION he approaches the overturned
car

There are two dead bodies inside

A woman A little boy

In the window a stuffed Garfield doll clings with
suction cups to the remaining glass The furry cat is
splattered with blood

HALLENBECK (VO)
It was a high-speed collision
Both cars were totaled The woman
and the boy were dead The driver
of the other car wasnt

STAGGERING DRUNK
is weaving toward Hallenbeck
Leaving behind his crumpled Mercedes

He wears an 800 suit Tan Cordovan loafers Silk tie
DRUNK
Fuckin bitch She got in front

Stupid bitch wrecked my car
He stumbles toward Hallenbeck eyes attempting to focus

DRUNK

Do you know who I am Im

Louis Baynard my father is

Calvin D Baynard man Call my

father hell take care of it
The man lurches to a stop in front of Hallenbeck
Clutching at Joes lapels Wheezing liquor fumes
He presses a hundred dollar bill into Joes hand

DRUNK
Youll tell em what happened
right Bitch swerved in front

of me man Wrecked my fuckin
Mercedes Right

HALLENBECK (VO)

I could smell bourbon on him big

time He was standing there not

a scratch on him I went a little

nuts I hit him
In SLOW MOTION Hallenbeck backhands the rich drunk
with a head-snapping impact that bursts lips Breaks
teeth
We see the Drunks head slowly strike the asphalt
A sickening concussion
HALLENBECK
The blow was non-lethal But when
he fell his head hit the pavement
funny Put him in a coma

The younger Hallenbeck stands on the highway of eight
years past staring at the Drunk with fierce blazing
eyes as we --

SNAP BACK TO

JIMMY AND JOE - BACK TO PRESENT

tip

A duplicate of the one Darian showed him
He swings his legs off the bed

Stands crushes out his cigarette

Moves into the bathroom

The Baggie of coke is on the counter

He stares at it with bloodshot eyes
Swallows hard

Acts before he can think

Grabs the Baggie Tosses it in the toilet
Flushes Watches as it goes down the drain

EXT CASA LOMA APARTMENTS - MORNING
Another Goddamned day
A chill drizzle The palm trees look forlorn

AT CORNER NEWSSTAND
Jimmy buys a paper Trudges along Ventura Boulevard
Huddled against the chill

SLEEK BLACK SEDAN
slides to the curb in front of him
Two men get out

One is Pablo who last we saw wielding a chainsaw in
Milos snuff film the other is an ugly piece of hired
muscle who well call CHET

The two men flank Jimmy and walk alongside him

He looks up startled

PABLO

Good morning Jimmy

JIMMY

Who are you and how the fuck do
you know my name

CHET
(frowns)
This is the guy You sure its
the guy
PABLO
This is him
CHET
The kid with the million-dollar
arm
PABLO

CHET

PABLO

JIMMY

CHET

JIMMY

PABLO

club

CHET
Mr Marcon sent us to teach you a
lesson Jimmy Something about
keeping your big coked-up nose
out of his fucking business
PABLO
Get ready kid This ones an E
ticket
And with that they grab Jimmy under the arms
Carry him across the sidewalk to a plywood fence
JIMMY
Please guys dont do this
Jesus Christ I was just her
boyfriend I swear to God please
They toss Jimmy over the fence

ANOTHER ANGLE

Not a terrible fate under normal circumstances
In this case however --

A fifty-foot drop

Awaits him beyond the fence

A huge looming pit dug into the earth

Foundation for a new parking garage

Jimmy plummets like a stone

Under normal circumstances hed be dead

But since it rained last night hes got three feet of
water to land in

He hits with a splash Disappears beneath the water
Surfaces screaming in pain

Thrashes in the muddy water and only when he looks down
does he notice the splintered bone jutting out of his
skin at a crazy angle

His million-dollar arm His throwing arm
He clutches at cracked ribs screaming

JIMMY
Oh God my arm my fucking arm
oh Jesus Christ
e kneels in the muddy water rocking back and forth

LONG SHOT - JIMMY

Alone in the pit

Huddled in a pool of muddy water

His screams of pain ECHO in the chill morning air

INT LAPD ROBBERYHOMICIDE DIVISION - DAY

CUT TO

JOE HALLENBECKS UNCONSCIOUS FACE
Weathered Sallow Dark circles under the eyes
HAND
comes INTO FRAME and slaps him Hard

Rocks his head to one side

INT ELEGANT BEACH HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - ANOTHER ANGLE
Thick carpet Polished wood furniture Window walls
Outside the sea is angry and grey

PABLO AND CHET
are standing over Hallenbeck who is slumped in a chair
Both hitmen wear holstered sidearms
Chet leans over and slaps Hallenbeck again
The big detective begins to stir
His eyelids flutter
CHET
I think hes awake
PABLO
Make sure
Chets hand flashes out for a third slap --
And from nowhere Joe Hallenbecks hand magically
appears
Intercepts the blow
Clamps onto Chets hand and wrenches it
A cry of pain
Chet stumbles backward cradling the wrist
HALLENBECK
Im awake
His eyelids creak open
He squints adjusting to the light
Studies his captors
CHET
You nearly broke my wrist man
HALLENBECK
Lifes a bitch
( )

He starts pawing his coat pockets looking for a cigarette
In the corner Pablo chuckles

PABLO
Milo warned us to watch out for
this guy
Chet is seething He glares at Hallenbeck
Hallenbeck yawns
CHET

Fuck that Look at him Hes
nothin Guys a piece of shit

Hallenbeck ignores him Sits up Rubs tired eyes
HALLENBECK
Anybody got a cigarette
Chet steps forward Grins wickedly
CHET
Sure buddy I got a cigarette

He reaches into his shirt pocket Extracts a Marlboro
Hands it to Hallenbeck Takes out a lighter
Hallenbeck places the cigarette between his lips
Leans forward for a light --

And Chet slugs him in the face

The cigarette goes flying

Hallenbecks head snaps back

Blood creeps from his lower lip

CHET
(guffaws)
Hey baby I thought you were
tough See Pablo he aint so
bad
Hallenbecks eyes glint fiercely He takes a breath
Leans forward and says
HALLENBECK
I seem to have dropped my
cigarette May I have another

Chet turns meets his gaze The grin falters a bit
CHET
(unnerved)
Sure Sure thing buddy
( )

He hands Hallenbeck another smoke
Hallenbeck puts it between his lips
HALLENBECK
I need a light
(beat)
And if you touch me again Ill
kill you
A pregnant pause
he challenge hangs in the air
lowly Chet takes the lighter from his pocket
blo looks on a smile twisting his features
lenbeck leans forward for a light
het extends his arm --
d slugs Hallenbeck in the face again
cks him
het howls with laughter

CHET
Baby Two for two
The laughter continues
Hallenbeck takes a deep breath
Stands up
Strikes with a flattened palm
Breaks Chets nose
Drives it up into the brain
Chet stands pole-axed Blinks once
Pitches over dead

And suddenly Pablo isnt laughing

He stares at Hallenbeck incredulous
Stares at Chet lying on the carpet
PABLO

Jesus Christ
(draws his gun)

You son-of-a-bitch Jesus Christ
He rushes to Chet Kneels beside him
Hallenbeck calmly returns to his seat

PABLO

You killed him Fuckin A you

killed him hes fuckin dead
Hallenbeck says nothing

( )

At that moment a door opens and Milo enters
Slick Well-dressed Utterly composed
MILO
Is there a problem
PABLO
(still dazed)
He killed Chet Milo The mother-
fucker just killed him
Milo looks toward Hallenbeck Hallenbeck says nothing
Instead he calmly leans forward and picks up Chets
lighter from the carpet Lights his cigarette Blows
smoke
A tense moment and then Milo does something un-
expected He starts to laugh Advances into the room
chuckling
MILO

Oh my Oh Goddamn Joseph

Joseph you dont disappoint me
He draws a Walther PPK and approaches Hallenbeck
Smiling and cheerful

MILO
You seem to have killed one of
my men
HALLENBECK
(shrugs)

I needed a light
Milo nods as if this makes perfect sense

MILO
You took an awful risk Pablo
here could have shot you dead
HALLENBECK
If you wanted me dead youd have
already killed me
MILO
Yes thats true
(sits down)
I suppose introductions are in
order
HALLENBECK
(waves his hand)
Fuck it Youre the bad guy

right
( )

MILO
Yes Im the bad guy
HALLENBECK

And youve got the gun and Im
supposed to tremble in fear
something like that

MILO
Something like that

HALLENBECK
Fine Ill start trembling ina
minute Mind if I have a drink
first

MILO
(smiles)
I dont see why not Pablo
please take Chets corpse into
the other room and then fix Mr
Hallenbeck a drink
Suddenly a voice rings out from the doorway
VOICE (0S)
Make that two
Hallenbeck turns toward the new arrival
HALLENBECK
Hey look whos here Connie
Marcon himself
Sure enough CONRAD MARCON saunters in just like he owns
the place Which by the way he does Tall strong
Texas-tough Dressed in a Saville Row suit He frowns
at Hallenbeck
MARCON
Careful son Only my friends
call me Connie
HALLENBECK
You got friends When did this
happen
MARCON
(chuckles)
Ill give you one thing Youre
pretty calm for a man in your
position
( )

HALLENBECK
Youre pretty calm for a man whose
team is three and six on the year
MARCON
Theyre having some problems
HALLENBECK
They stink
Marcons composure falters but only for a moment
MARCON
Im glad youre here Joe We
got a few things to discuss

He takes a moment to gather his thoughts
MARCON
For starters Im sure youre
aware that professional football
is changing and not for better
(lights a cigar)

Used to be you went to the local
stadium come Sunday you saw
heroes Guys who fought for
their hometown Anymore no one
gives a shit Ever since Sonny
Werblin paid 400000 to Joe
Namath back in 66 the sons of

bitches just got greedier

Playing only for themselves

Giving nothing back to the game
Pablo hands him a double bourbon

MARCON
This year the final blow the
NFL votes to decertify the
Players Organization Eliminates
the draft reduces all athletes
to free agents Reduces football
once and for all to commerce To
greed you follow

HALLENBECK
When do I say the Pledge of
Allegiance
Marcon looks directly at Hallenbeck
( )

MARCON
Do you know how many ratings points
Monday Night Football lost this
year Per week An average of
two point eight

HALLENBECK
Oh for Chrissake Youre telling
me this whole thing is about TV
ratings

MARCON
People have stopped watching Joe
Everybodys turning the channel
theyre still looking for heroes
you follow Guys like you Milo
here tells me you took a bullet
for the President jumped in front
of a sniper rifle

Hallenbeck reacts startled Looks at Milo

MILO
We took the liberty of researching
your background

MARCON
How about it Joe Is it truth or
hype

HALLENBECK

(shrugs)

I got the rifle in my closet asa
souvenir

MARCON

There you go thats what Im
saying The public wants real
heroes Not a bunch of football
prima donnas jumping from team
to team with their fancy lawyers
(beat)
In fact Joe and this is my
point theres only one reason
left nowadays to watch pro-
football Can you guess
It begins to dawn on Hallenbeck

HALLENBECK

Gambling

MARCON
Exactly Gambling
(puffs his cigar)
Just one problem football
gambling is illegal in all but
two of the fifty states And
that Joe boy is where I come in
HALLENBECK
(sudden realization)
Shit thats what this is about
Youre bribing United States
senators Paying them to pass
legislation --

MARCON
-- Legalizing football gambling
in all fifty states Exactly
HALLENBECK
Attendance goes up again TV
ratings go up again
MARCON
You got it son The networks are
happy Im happy Everybodys
happy
HALLENBECK
Before we get too fucking happy
lets get a couple things straight
first Im not your fucking son
and second why am I still alive
Marcon stops pacing Sighs and sits down facing
Hallenbeck

MARCON
Its like this Joe everything
was going great until a couple
weeks ago and then I hit a snag
Senator Calvin Baynard
HALLENBECK
(takes a sip of bourbon)
I dont get it Whats the snag
MARCON
I offered him the bribe and he
wouldnt take it

Hallenbeck actually does a spit-take Sprays bourbon

HALLEBECK

Baynard Are you nuts The guys
so crooked he shits slinkies
MARCON
Allow me to clarify I offered
him the bribe and he turned it
down because he wanted more money
HALLENBECK
(sighs with relief)
Thank God For a minute there I
felt hell freezing over Did he
ask for more than a million

MARCON
Does the Pope shit in the woods
He wants two million or hell
blow the lid off my whole plan
I dont feel like paying no two
mil so basically that good ole
boys gotta die
HALLENBECK
Taking off a US senator thats
pretty ballsy Even for an asshole

like you
MARCON
Oh Im not going to kill Baynard
Joe
HALLENBECK
Who is
Marcon says nothing Just looks at Hallenbeck and
smiles
HALLENBECK
Oh shit
He rubs tired eyes
HALLENBECK

Im the perfect fall guy Everyone
and his uncle Max knows I hate
Baynard
MARCON
(nods)
Anything goes wrong all the heat
lands on you Joe boy My hands
are clean

Hallenbeck scowls

( )

HALLENBECK
Any particular reason I should go
along with this prize-winning
scheme
MARCON
(smiles)
Just one
He motions to Milo who disappears through a doorway
Reappears a moment later
Hes got Joes wife
ANGLE ON HALLENBECK
He stands Face contorting Fists clenched
Rage courses through him like an electric current
Marcon cocks his gun
MARCON
Sit down Joe
A moment Joe stands smouldering On fire Sarah
speaks
SARAH
Do what he says Joe
Joe sits Breathing shallowly
Eyes locked on Milo
HALLENBECK
Are you alright Sarah
SARAH
Yes
MILO
Thats a temporary condition
Joseph As you may be aware
there are distributors in Mexico
who positively crave snuff films
And unless you do every fucking
thing Mr Marcon tells you your
wife will make her motion picture
debut
He meets Joes murderous gaze and smiles

INT HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM - DAY

The grey day wears on

Jimmy trudges stiffly down the walk toward his apartment

unit Pulls up short staring ahead --

DARIAN HALLENBECK

Cut TO

Slumped outside the door to his apartment Asleep

crumpled piece of paper clutched in her hand

He kneels beside her Touches her shoulder
JIMMY

Hey Wake up

She stirs Awakens looking at him

Her eyes are puffy and red from crying

Her hair is a tangled mess

She hands him the piece of paper and promptly bursts

into tears

Buries her head in his chest sobbing

He cradles her with his good arm

Awkwardly unfolds the crumpled paper and reads
MOMMY AND DADDY ARE WITH US

CALL THE POLICE AND WELL KILL THEM BOTH

He stares at the note dumbstruck

Izod shirt

He stops in front of Sarah and Joe Hallenbeck

They are seated on the dock
Each handcuffed to a metal railing
Pablo kneels and unfastens Joes cuffs
PABLO
Get up
HALLENBECK

Go fuck yourself
Pablo delivers a savage kick to Hallenbecks ribs
Hallenbeck gasps in pain

HALLENBECK
I meant that in a good way
Pablo hauls him to his feet Props him against the
railing
PABLO

Call it a service to dear departed
Chet

He slams a fist into Hallenbecks middle
Sarah cries out in alarm
PABLO
Hows that feel fuckhead
HALLENBECK

Rains punches on his chest and gut
Slams an elbow into his kidneys
Drives a knee into his groin

Milo calls out from the boat

MILO

Easy Pablo I want him conscious
Pablo is kicking Joes prone form

SARAH
Goddamn you stop it Oh Jesus

( )

Pablo gives Joe a last swift kick Spits on him
Hallenbeck vomits Lies bleeding on the dock

Whistling cheerfully

He squats next to Joe

wifes fate
He yanks Hallenbeck to his feet
Propels him toward the boat
As her husband is being led away Sarah calls out
SARAH

Joe

He stops Turns Looks at her
Boys and girls there is within Joe Hallenbeck a spark
Tiny Fizzling Almost gone
But now looking at his wife that spark unexpectedly
kindles --
And eight years melt away
Just like that
The old Joe Hallenbeck looks his wife in the eye and
says with deadly calm

HALLENBECK
Ill be back
(beat)
Thats a promise
Milo clubs Joe in the head with his pistol
MILO
Youre wasting my time Joseph

Lets go
Hallenbeck turns Dirty Tired Unshaven Bloody
He looks at Milo and grins
HALLENBECK

They stare into each others eyes
Hallenbeck does not give an inch
Milo hits him again

He points to the identical twin

(nods)
Detonation upon opening Enough
to kill the passengers not enough
to sink the craft
(smiles)
And when we place your charred
corpse amidst the wreckage the
police will draw the inevitable
conclusion a down-on-his-luck
PI makes a suicide strike
against the man who cost a
career
HALLENBECK
That sounds lovely but how is my
body gonna get charred

With a flourish Milo pulls aside a tablecloth
Under the table is a five gallon can of gasoline
MILO
Maybe Ill get to hear you scream

after all
Just then one of Milos crew sticks his head in the
door
CREW MEMBER
You better get up here we got
a problem

EXT YACHT - ON DECK - NIGHT
Milos yacht is anchored about a half mile offshore
Island lights blink in the distance Fog rolls in
Milo emerges from the cabin onto the deck

Baynards Aide whistles softly

Examines the stacks of bills Nods satisfied

Okay lets go Full throttle

INT YACHT - SAME TIME
With a final resounding crash Hallenbeck kicks open the
compartment Topples out onto the cabin floor

( )

Works his bound hands over his knees so theyre now tied
in front of him
Everybodys topside for the moment at least he is

forgotten

He half crawls half lurches over to the kitchen nook
Worms beneath the table awkward desperate

Drags out the can of gasoline

Tries to unscrew the top No dice Cant get a grip

Finally in frustration he tips the can on its side
Brings his legs up in the air --

Slams them down on the can

Over and over until with a metallic pop -- it bursts
Floods gasoline over the carpet meanwhile

BACK TOPSIDE

Milos yacht is plowing ahead gaining on Jimmys
Hatteras The crew members take up positions on the
prow OPEN FIRE

WITH JIMMY
As he throws Darian to the deck shields her with his
body

The wheelhouse is RAKED by GUNFIRE

He grits his teeth Reaches beneath his tux

Yanks out the BERETTA and returns FIRE BAM -- BAM --
and meanwhile

INT YACHT CABIN
Hallenbeck is opening a box of kitchen matches with his
teeth
Dozens of matches fall scattered on the carpet
He releases the box Bends Picks up a single match in
his teeth
Presses his face to the wall Gives his neck a wrench --
Lights the match
He drops the match on top of the GAS CAN
( )

A WHOOSH of combustion It bursts into flame
Joe swivels around Balancing on his backside
Thrusts his legs into the fire
Strains Pulls Sweat runs in rivers
Until the ropes binding his legs snap
He lurches to his feet lets free
Now theres only one problem Hes on fire
The legs of his pants are soaked with gas
Flames race up his legs
He plunges headlong up the stairs

ON TO DECK

where he hurtles toward the rail dives --
into the sea swallowed by the waves

A CREWMAN suddenly screams

CREWMAN
Fire in the hole
Fire indeed Its a rapidly-spreading blaze

The pursuit is momentarily forgotten as the crew races to
put out the fire and meanwhile

HALLENBECK
surfaces gasping for air Trying to swim with his hands
tied

DARIAN
spots him first Sees her father bobbing like a cork in

the ocean screams
DARIAN

Daddy
Jimmy whirls around startled

JIMMY
Shit I dont believe it
DARIAN
Do something Hurry

Jimmy spins the wheel Banks hard to port
Brings the boat around in an arc Yells to Darian
JIMMY
Keep the wheel like this Dont
let it move
She grabs the wheel Jimmy bends down Opens a compart-
ment Takes out the boats anchor Metal hook attached
to seventy yards of chain He hefts it like a grappling
hook
JIMMY
Third and long baby lets go

And sure his left arm isnt his good arm --

But boy does he heave that anchor

It soars through space chain playing out behind it
Hits water thirty yards past Hallenbeck --

Who turns sees the anchor skimming toward him over the
waves

EXT MILOS YACHT
Milo meanwhile has also spotted Hallenbeck
He growls in rage Hefts the Ingram machine gun as

ANOTHER ANGLE
Hallenbeck thrusts forward hooks his bound hands around
the passing anchor and whoosh --

He is catapulted forward jerked like a rag puppet
BULLETS CHOP the water where he just was
He skims over the waves Bounced Battered
Trailing behind Jimmy at fifty miles an hour
Jimmy and Darian begin to haul him in
Struggling Straining
The boat rushing headlong driverless
With a last desperate surge of energy --
They drag Hallenbeck over the side Into the boat
DARIAN

She collapses weeping atop her father
Hugs him for all shes worth
HALLENBECK
What the hells she doing here

GUNFIRE splits the air
Reminds them theyre not out of the woods

is behind them again The fire is out The chase is on
It steadily cuts the distance

Hallenbeck staggers to his feet

HALLENBECK
Get below Darian And stay

He stumbles into the wheelhouse Dazed Barely
conscious
JIMMY
Got any ideas
HALLENBECK

Yeah Go really fast and hope
they dont catch us
(beat)
Oh shit
JIMMY
What
HALLENBECK

Fog bank dead ahead Hang on
Into the fog they go and folks --
This is really scary
Because you cant see a foot in front of your face
They plunge through the fog at fifty miles an hour
Hallenbeck sweats eyes glued to the windshield

And then a shape materializes off to port
Milos yacht
Running alongside Drawing closer
Hallenbeck wrestles the wheel No dice
The yacht draws ever closer men on deck machine
guns
Joe looks over and his face tells the story

HALLENBECK
Were dead
Except just then a strange thing happens
Milos yacht veers off to the left Away from
Hallenbeck Jimmy stares dumbfounded
JIMMY
What the fuck Theyre peeling
off Why
A pause then it hits Joe like a thunderbolt
HALLENBECK
Cause they got sonar thats why
Hard to port
JIMMY
Port
HALLENBECK
Left Goddammit
The boat slews to the left as from out of the fog --

The Catalina ferry looms right in front of them
JIMMY

Shit fuck piss
They almost make it
As it is they avoid a head-on Instead they hit
broadside
A sickening CRUNCH --
Jimmy and Joe are thrown from their feet
A momentary glimpse of faces rushing past -- Horrified
tourists -- And then the ferry is behind them
Jimmy gets up Staggers to the controls
Pushes the throttle The boat lurches forward --
Then SPUTTERS Fizzles
He swears violently

JIMMY
Were on half power we lost an
engine

EXT FOG BANK - SAME TIME
The crippled boat chugs through the mist

HALLENBECK
Kill the running lights and radio

Jimmy flicks off the lights Grabs the mike As he
does a VIBRATING RUMBLE fills the cockpit causing him
to pause and then stare in shock as their boat emerges
from the fog --
And Air One hovers directly overhead
JIMMY
Fuck me
The two men watch helpless as the helicopter descends
the Co-Pilot taking aim with a LAWS rocket

HALLENBECK

Get down
They both hit the floor Hands over their heads --
And then the pilot makes a costly error
He descends right into the path of Milos yacht
With no warning whatsoever the boat comes bursting out
of the fog --
PLOWS right INTO the HELICOPTER
Second number one The boat pierces the chopper rips it
to shreds
Second number two The whole boat-slash-chopper mix
erupts in a shower of wood and fiberglass Turns night
into day

JIMMY AND JOE

are still huddled on the floor
Pause They look up Bewildered

Why arent they dead

He starts to turn away Notices something in the water
Speaks over his shoulder to Jimmy

He fishes in the water Snares a large floating object
Swings it aboard Drops it at Jimmys feet

Stuffs extras into a black Windbreaker

Hears a NOISE Looks up expecting Jimmy --
Draws a sharp breath

PABLO AND ASSORTED GOONS
standing in the doorway All of them have guns
Pablo grins shakes his head
PABLO
Face it pal Youre fucked by
God
CUT TO

PAD AND PAPER
as theyre placed in front of Hallenbeck
He is seated on the bed Three guns covering him
Beside him sits Furry Tom grinning his stuffed-toy grin
PABLO
Are you a literate man Joe
HALLENBECK
I got a subscription to Jugs
magazine
PABLO
Thats good See Joe what

write a little story

A GOON sticks his head in the door
GOON
Weve got Jimmy Dix in the trunk
PABLO

finished
The Goon departs leaving Hallenbeck with Pablo and two
others He studies them Calculates the odds Verdict
Bad
PABLO
Yeah youre gonna write a little
story Joe About how guilt-
stricken you are over Senator
Baynards death which is all
over the air waves by the way
Yeah youre so guilty about
paying those hitmen to kill him
that youre gonna kill yourself
HALLENBECK
Hey whos writing this story
Youre doing all the good parts

PABLO
Oh and Joe Dont forget to
include how guilty you are over
that cop you murdered

HALLENBECK
What cop

( )

Pablo draws his pistol
PUMPS TWO SHOTS into the unconscious cop in the corner
PABLO
That one
HALLENBECK
You son of a bitch
Pablo is making a big mistake but he doesnt know it
He is fueling Joe Hallenbecks rage
Pity the fool
Hallenbeck regards him with dead lifeless eyes
A thoroughly unnerving stare

Then Joe does something very odd
He says softly
HALLENBECK
We dont like Pablo very much do
we Furry Tom

There is a pause And then incredibly -- Furry Tom
answers A high-pitched squeaky stuffed cat voice
HALLENBECK

(as Furry Tom)
No Mr Hallenbeck we think Pablo
is a motherless fuck who takes it
up the ass
Dead silence Pablo is completely thrown so are we for
that matter and then it hits us Joe is doing ven-
triloquism

And the funny thing is hes really good
Pablo overcomes his shock

PABLO
Shit is he doing that
Hallenbecks face remains cold Expressionless
HALLENBECK

Furry Tom tell Pablo what Im
gonna do to him
HALLENBECK
(as Furry Tom)
Youre gong to make Pablo eat all
his teeth Mr Hallenbeck
( )

Pablo cant help it He bursts out laughing
PABLO
Thats amazing man
Hallenbeck picks up Furry Tom Inserts his hand makes
the furry head bob back and forth
HALLENBECK
(as Furry Tom)
Hey Mr Hallenbeck theyre
laughin at me Thats not very
nice
By now all three hoods are in hysterics

HALLENBECK
Are you mad Furry Tom
HALLENBECK
(as Furry Tom)
I dont get mad I get even

And with that Furry Toms mouth opens --
And EXPLODES showering stuffing
One of the goons is still laughing when he realizes half
his throat is gone
And Furry Thomas BELCHES FIRE again and the second goon
goes down in a spray of blood and if you havent guessed
already --
Joe has a gun hidden inside Furry Thomas
Pablo is a little sharper A little quicker
He dives forward knocks the puppet from Joes hand
Joe drives upward into Pablos gut
They reel across the room Locked in combat
Lamps topple GLASS BREAKS
Pablo slams Joes head into the wall Leaves a dent
Does it again a sickening impact
Starts to strangle Joe --
And the truth is Joes not thirty anymore
Hes not going to make it The world swims away
Then as if through a tunnel Joe notices something

beside him something hanging on the wall
Fights to focus Breath gone Strength gone
Identifies the object

His Presidential Medal of Valor

Shiny medal Shiny ribbon His name

It hits him quite suddenly

The medal has sharp edges

With the last of his strength he plucks it from the
wall Drives it into Pablos throat
The big man stumbles backward Eyes wide Gurgling

He thrashes the red-white-blue ribbon flapping obscenely
from his gushing neck

Drops to the dusty carpet Dies

Hallenbeck takes a deep breath Eyes wide Insane
He is surrounded by corpses He takes another deep
breath

Picks up the sniper rifle

Slings it over his shoulder

Heads for the door

Brings it down on Jimmys broken arm

EXT HOLLYWOOD HILLS - NIGHT

Hallenbeck leaves the rented Subaru by the side of the
road

He is dressed in combat black Government issue

Rifle over one shoulder Hunting knife in a hip
scabbard

Like an angel of death he moves into the brush
Heading down the canyon

EXT MARCONS HOME - SAME TIME

An armed sentry patrols the grounds

Below him nighttime LA stretches to the Pacific
Joe Hallenbeck emerges like a wraith from the trees
Clamps a gloved hand over the sentrys mouth

Drives the hunting knife into his back

INT LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME
Marcon stirs the fireplace logs stoking the blaze
Replaces the poker Crosses to his desk and sits

Jimmy is on the carpet delirious Out of it
Marcon presses a button An armed HARDGUY appears
HARDGUY

MARCON
Hes nothing he cant hurt us
Take him somewhere and kill him
HARDGUY
Yes sir
The Hardguy crosses the room Grips Jimmy by the

shoulders

With a soft SPIT of sound his forehead blooms crimson
He collapses lifeless

At his desk Marcon whirls stunned as

JOE HALLENBECK
steps through the French doors behind him
He resembles nothing human A demon in black
Eyes burning Gun held loosely An extension of his
arm
Marcon reaches for the button to summon help
HALLENBECK

Dont
He jams the rifle barrel into Marcons throat nearly
crushing his larynx Hisses

HALLENBECK
The gun is silenced Ill fuckin

HALLENBECK

The Strange Man chuckles
STRANGE MAN
Sorry but that wont work I
dont care if he lives or dies

A pause Once more Joe calculates the odds No dice
He places the rifle on the desk
STRANGE MAN
Walk over there by your friend

Hallenbeck turns around and for once his jaw drops
Hes looking at a man he never thought hed see again A
man who suffers from facial paralysis ever since his head
bounced off the Georgetown turnpike eight years ago

LOUIS BAYNARD
Son of the late senator The right side of his face
doesnt quite match the left The muscles dont work
Hallenbeck recovers his composure As Jimmy climbs to
his feet Joe walks over and stands next to him Two
gunmen appear behind them covering the rear

BAYNARD
Nothing more or less than youd do
for me Conrad
(turns)
I never thought Id see you again
Joe

HALLENBECK
Speaking of which what the fuck
are you doing here

BAYNARD
Call it a financial partnership
For a price I agreed to connect
Mr Marcon to the necessary
people in Washington

HALLENBECK
In other words you dropped your
fathers name a bunch of times

( )

BAYNARD
(ignores him)
But imagine my delight this morning
Joe when Mr Marcon informed me
of a golden opportunity a chance
to kill my father and frame you for
the crime What can I say
inherit a fortune and humiliate you
in the bargain who could resist
HALLENBECK
Do I also have you to thank for
dragging me into this mess
BAYNARD
(sighs)
It was I unfortunately who
bought a forty-dollar bottle of

champagne spoke a little too
freely to that hooker
JIMMY
She wasnt a hooker dickhead
HALLENBECK

He should know Jimmy With a
face like that hes gotta be
paying for it
BAYNARD
You can die fast or slow so watch
your mouth
Jimmy chimes in

JIMMY

goofy-lookin
Marcon has had enough He pounds his fist on the desk
MARCON

Marcon holds up his hand
MARCON

MARCON

phone call from the boat on the
way in

MARCON
You called the cops Fuck it

HALLENBECK
Oh but I didnt call the cops I
called the mob

Marcon stares at him Blinks

HALLENBECK

See Connie every year the mob
rakes in two and a half billion
from football bookmaking If you
succeed in making gambling legal
all that money goes to the
government

(beat)
I wouldnt be surprised if they
put out a contract on you Of

Marcon stares him down A pause Then Marcon smiles

MARCON
Hes bluffing Hes not connected
to the mob what a load of
horseshit Nice try asshole
(waves his hand)
Kill them
HALLENBECK
(plowing ahead)
Then theres the matter of two
million dollars Or didnt you

He once again looks Marcon in the eye

HALLENBECK

Subaru Well take you to it

Jimmy reaches inside his jeans Slowly cautiously pulls
something out concealed in his fist

We see but Marcon doesnt

Its a shredder shell He holds it in his fist

JIMMY
Promise youll let me go
MARCON
Hell with that son Hand it over
or Ill have you kneecapped
JIMMY
Oh yeah Well thats too bad
See its one of those new plastic
eys The kind that melt
And with that he hurls it into the fire
So fast that nobody can see just what he threw
JIMMY
guess nobody gets the money
The two hardguys rush to the fireplace

MARCON

Pull it out of there

One of them grabs a pair of tongs --

and the SHREDDER EXPLODES

Sprays the two hardguys Cuts them to ribbons
Then several things happen at once

Everybody goes for a gun

Hallenbeck lunges scoops up a fallen pistol --
As Marcon draws his GUN and FIRES missing --

Joe RETURNS FIRE BAM-BAM --

Catches Marcon in the shoulder and meanwhile --
( )

Baynard draws down on Jimmy who picks up a flaming log
and hurls it knocks the SHOT wild as
Marcon darts out the French doors into the night so
Hallenbeck spins FIRES at Baynard --

Blows him backward in a bloody spray Baynard sags
against the mantel Collapses dead

ECHOES Silence Jimmy and Joe are alone with three
corpses

Jimmy snatches up a pistol Joe slings the sniper rifle
over his shoulder Stares at Jimmy

Hallenbeck spins behind one of the billboard support
legs as BULLETS CHOP it to splinters

MILO
advances
changing clips Methodical Precise
Like a robot
He is obsessed All vestige of sanity gone

MILO
You fucked up my face Joseph
Joe starts to climb Scales the wooden structure
Swings himself onto the raised platform
Flattens behind the billboard
MILO
Dont try to hide Joseph Ive
got all night you fucked up my
face
He sprays a BURST of GUNFIRE up at the billboard

HALLENBECK

huddles behind the billboard as the bullets stitch
upward Through the wooden frame

A hot SLUG RIPS through Joes arm

An eruption of blood He hisses in pain

Rolls away from the gunfire

Looks around Desperate

Sees a painters bucket lying nearby

He counts to three

DOWN BELOW

Milo calmly changes clips

Hallenbeck bursts from cover

Hurls the bucket down at Milo dashes across the front of
the billboard hard and fast --

BULLETS CHOPPING the board right behind him blowing
holes in Gorgeouss derrierre --

And then Joe does a risky thing

He sprints to the end of the billboard running full
tilt and he leaps out into space what the hell is he
doing

Hes trying to make the freeway
Its a good fifteen feet Try it sometime

He flies through open air --
Milos GUN CHATTERING below seeking him out --
And just does make it
Hits the freeway surface and collapses forward screaming
as he rolls on his injured arm Looks up --

EIGHTEEN WHEEL TRUCK

is headed straight for him bearing down

He rolls aside just in time It THUNDERS past
Staggers to his feet frantic --

and Milo is climbing the billboard

Hallenbeck looks for a place to hide

There isnt any

Hes going to have to run through traffic

He shifts from foot to foot searching for an opening
and meanwhile --

INT SUBARU - DRIVING
Jimmy Dix is actually on the freeway driving when he
looks across the center divider and sees Hallenbeck

JIMMY
I dont fucking believe it
He swerves over to the side and meanwhile

HALLENBECK
watches in dismay as Milo climbs onto the platform
Walks across the front of the billboard
Toward the freeway Toward Joe Snarling
Joe grabs a broken bottle off the ground Heaves it
Milo puts up an arm catches a glancing blow Blood
flows All it does is piss him off
MILO
You ruined my flesh
( )

Hallenbeck dives flat to the road as Milo opens up again
a chattering BURST of GUNFIRE The muzzle flash is
blinding
The windshield of a passing car SHATTERS -- The driver
panics the car spins out of control --
Slews across the road in the middle of traffic
COLLISIONS CRUMPLING METAL EXPLOSIONS of GLASS
SCREECHING TIRES

CAR
slides straight toward Hallenbeck

He dives aside rolls to his feet --
And hes right in Milos sights

My friends the fat lady just sang
Except another lady says different
A single GUNSHOT SPLITS the air
Milos chest explodes with bubbling blood
He shrieks Turns staring in disbelief at

SARAH HALLENBECK
below on the lawn She aims Joes service revolver and
says
SARAH
You just fucking die

She FIRES again and Milo reels backward
Leaves a bloody smudge on the billboard
She DROPS the HAMMER again and again Empties the gun
Milo jerks and twitches Racked by gunfire
Paints a bloody stripe across the billboard making
Gorgeouss bloody buns even bloodier --
Clutches himself Looks over at Hallenbeck
HALLENBECK
Shes something isnt she
Milo pitches forward Falls to his death

HALLENBECK
stares dumbfounded at Sarah She look up at him
A moment passes between them
Around Hallenbeck a sea of crumpled cars HORNS
BLARING Amidst it all he stands Beaten Bloody
Bullet-scarred
Jimmy winds his way through the cars Walks up to Joe
They stand in silence for a moment then Jimmy says
JIMMY

JIMMY
Somebody broke in and swiped the
suitcase from the back seat Had

There is a pause They both stare at the car
Two million Down the drain
Except after a beat they begin to laugh
First chuckling then chortling
Now its go-for-broke Jimmy hoots Joe howls
Jimmy pulls out a key and opens the trunk --
You can guess whats inside

EAST LA SIDESTREET - NIGHT

Two ten-year-old black boys are walking down the street
Out strolling in the poverty that exists in the shadow of
the skyscrapers

Quite suddenly without warning --

A football drops out of the sky

Hits and bounces very high --

Comes down Settles Rocks back and forth

The kids look up puzzled Searching the sky
The ball sits there Only slightly scorched
Tentatively almost like hes afraid of being caught
one of the boys bends down looks both ways
Picks up the ball Smiles

Then as if by some unspoken agreement --
The other boy starts to run
Slowly at first then faster faster still
A slant pattern heading for the mailbox
And at 12 midnight on December 22nd the San Pedro Street
quarterback throws an absolutely perfect pass
Their laughter is joyful Innocent Fervid
They will grow up to be sports heroes
