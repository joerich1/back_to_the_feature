ROUTE 9
Screenplay by Brendan Broderick and Rob Kerchner

FADE IN

EXT DESOLATE ROAD - DAY

The sound of HEAT BUGS rises -- fat blades of GRASS grow through the

asphalt of a DESOLATE THROUGHWAY --

In the background weeds grow chest-high neglected for
years --

A RUSTED HIGHWAY SIGN indicates the stretch was once a vital artery

ago -- it SQUEAKS as it wobbles alone
in the faint wind -- the heat is intense --

Far in the horizon a trail of DUST rises down the road
beat-up MERCEDES BENZ approach --

The car passes and drives down the road --

INT MERCEDES - DAY

and soon we

CLIFF a gaunt-looking Hispanic man with bad skin drives the car --

NATE another Hispanic sits next to him In the back seat is DENNING a

white man with greasy hair slicked back --

Cliff takes of his sunglasses looks at them and puts them back on --

glare is heavy --

POV the car passes another sign -- under it is a smaller

reading ROUTE 9

NATE

Cliff looks ahead --
EXT DESOLATE ROAD - DAY

The Mercedes turns on to another road --
EXT GAS STATION - DAY

The station has been shut for years and picked clean of most
the distance we see the Mercedes approach -

INT MERCEDES - DAY

The men look at the station No cars No nothing

NATE

CLIFF
Theyll be here

Cliff puts a stick of GUM in his mouth and chews it masking
EXT GAS STATION - DAY
The Mercedes pulls up and Cliff and Denning get out --

CLIFF
Damn its hot

Denning heads over into some weeds to pee walking in pain -

DENNING
(mostly to himself)
Any longer Ida pissed my pants

Cliff stretches talking to Nate through the open door

CLIFF
All right when they get here

it quick and get the hell out
of here before some six-toes
show up with their hats all

bent back

NATE
Close the door youre letting
out the AC --

everything -- in

his anxiety --

But Cliff ignores the request staring down the road at something

approaching

CLIFF
Here they come
A white VAN rises over a small hill appearing for a second and then
disappearing again

It appears over the nearest rise pulling into the station
The van stops

The doors do not open The sunlight glints off its windows preventing
anyone from seeing inside

Cliff scrutinizes the van pulling back the chamber of his 45 AUTOMATIC and
sticking it in the back of his pants

The van is silent for another long beat but then the side door opens and
THREE MEN get out -- WILLIE AIELLO

AND DIXON Mean-looking and untrustworthy they close the van door and look
around before focusing on Cliff -

Cliff looks at them --

Inside the car Nate has his hands on his concealed UZI --

Cliff masks his anxiety looking at the men --

Willie approaches --

WILLIE
Lets see what you got

Cliff stares at him for a beat -- then goes to the trunk of the car and opens
it --

Willie follows and looks at Nate who coldly returns the stare before looking
ahead --

Aiello and Dixon stand and face the Mercedes --
Cliff appears to open something in the trunk -- Willie inspects it --
CLIFF
(anxious)
Now all we have to do is test
your product and well all
be on our way

Willie looks in the trunk for a beat then turns to Cliff --

WILLIE
Test the product

CLIFF
Yeah

WILLIE
Sounds like you dont trust me

Willie goes for whats in the trunk --
CLIFF
Standard procedure bro

Cliff stands in front of Willie --

CLIFF
Standard procedure

Willie gives him a steely look --
WILLIE

Are you saying my word is of
no value to you

Cliff does not like whats happening -- he senses something is wrong --
CLIFF
Business is business Now where

the hell is it I wanna get out
of here Thats the plan were
just flunkies you know what Im
saying

WILLIE
You didnt answer my question
Are you saying my word is of no
value to you

CLIFF
You said that I didnt

Willie stares at Cliff for a beat -- tension hangs heavy in the air --

WILLIE

Youre getting off on a bad foot
with me son

(beat)
You see I dont like it when
people question my integrity
Now nothings going to happen
until you answer my question
Is my word of no value to you

Cliff stares at Willie --

CLIFF

Your word Welllet me see

(beat then derisively)
I guess its fair to say I dont
give a flying fuck through a
rolling donut about your word
All right Does that answer your
question
Willie stares at him nodding --

CLIFF
Now Im going to test the shit
that was the plan and if you have
a problem with it thats too bad
Now where is it

Willie ponders the offer --

WILLIE
I have a better plan You want to
hear it

CLIFF
(surprised)
What

WILLIE
I have a better plan

Cliff does not understand --

CLIFF
And whats that

WILLIE
(Beat)
How about you give us what you
have and leave

CLIFF
What

WILLIE

(turns to Aiello

and Dixon)
Am I speaking English here

(to Cliff

enunciating)
How-about-you-give-us-what-you-
have-and-leave

In a flash Cliff pulls out his gun pointing it at Willie

WILLIE
I take it thats a no

Aiello Dixon and Willie all pulls out GUNS

INT MERCEDES - DAY

Nate grabs his gun fighting to stay cool --
NATE

(to himself)
Oh shit oh shit
EXT GAS STATION - DAY

Aiello trains his gun on Nate Willie and Dixon train theirs on Cliff who
aims at Willie --

CLIFF
What is this Dont be stupid
man

WILLIE

First you question my integrity
then you call me stupid
(shakes head)
that hurts son
Suddenly another gunman SLICK emerges from behind the van with a shotgun --

BLAM Slick BLASTS a hole in Cliffs chest as he flies back collapsing ina
bloody mess --

Aiello and Dixon aim at the Mercedes and BLAM BLAM BLAM BLAM BLAM FIRE
RELENTLESSLY at Nate --

Willie finishes off Cliff with a BLAST then fires at the Mercedes --
INT MERCEDES - DAY

Nate ducks down as the bullets tear into the car -- in a total panic he grabs
the Uzi and FIRES through the windshield --

EXT GAS STATION - DAY
Dixon is hit with a few bullets as Aiello dives behind the van for cover --

Nate DIVES out of the Mercedes and FIRES at Dixon ripping him apart as
Willie and Aiello return fire --

Nate scrambles out firing back until he is out of ammo -- he frantically goes
to reload --

But Slick emerges from around the back of the gas station -- he aims at Nate
who cant reload in time --

As Slick goes to fire BLAM BLAM BLAM BLAM BLAM BLAM Denning BLASTS him away
as he runs from the weeds
his shirttail out-

Willie pokes out from behind the van and FIRES at Denning --

POW a direct hit to the THROAT sends Denning spinning to the ground
gurgling blood --

Aiello CHARGES at Nate as the two men literally face each other and empty
their guns in an absurd almost
comical shower of bullets tearing each other to bits --
Soon there is silence -- Willie slowly emerges looks around and approaches
Nate firing a bullet into
his head for good measure -

He then looks around and approaches the back of the
Mercedes --

CLOSE on Dennings bloody hand grabbing his gun --
As Willie looks around again opening the trunk --

POW POW POW POW Denning shoots him offscreen sending him staggering --
Soon he collapses to the ground in a bloody mess --

His face HITS THE DIRT --

And it is silent again

ROLL CREDITS - ROUTE 9

As the credits roll we see a MONTAGE of desert scenes ending on --

EST SHOT - EXT TRAILER HOME - DAY

Its isolated in a cul-de-sac of hills with a dirt road approachment and
two cars in front

INT TRAILER BEDROOM -- DAY

The place is decked out in classic bachelor Clothes everywhere a few beer
bottles magazines

Your mother would hate this place but its fine with --

SALLY HOGAN an attractive WOMAN in her early 30s who rolls on to her side
of the bed into frame

She is nude and has a look of blissful exhaustion on her face

She says nothing for a beat --

MANS VOICE(OS)
What time is it

Sally looks at the clock on the nightstand --
SALLY
(Beat closes her eyes)
Four-thirty
MANS VOICE(OS)
(Beat)
I gotta get ready

We then see a MAN sit up and swing his legs over the bed He is BOOTH
PARKER a trim clean-cut man in his early 30s

Sally hugs him from behind -- he reaches his arm around her and they kiss --
SALLY
We still have time

Booth gets up grabbing a random pair of underwear and white socks --
BOOTH

Booth begins to put on his DEPUTY uniform --

SALLY

BOOTH

SALLY

SALLY

Booth puts on his olive green TIE --

BOOTH
Ah hell hed do the same for me

SALLY

BOOTH

(Beat)
But he would probably

Booth sits on the edge of the bed and ties his black leather shoes --
Booth gets up and brushes his hair --
Sally wraps the sheet around her and stands behind him --
Sally turns him around and straightens his tie --
SALLY
I hope you get it back
(Beat)

We could have a lot of fun
with four hundred dollars

They kiss -
SALLY
Get a room in a nice hotel for a

few hours

BOOTH
I might have to look into that

They continue to kiss --

TO
EXT SHERIFFS STATION - EVENING

DISSOLVE

The building is a small sub-station off a two-lane highway outside the city

Two patrol cars are in front --

JESSES VOICE(VO)
I tell you some people are too damn
smart for their own good Take that
case in Richfield

DWAYNES VOICE(VO)
The mother son thing

INT SHERIFFS STATION - EVENING

We see Sheriff DWAYNE HOGAN a stout ruddy-faced man in his late 40s

talking to the local coroner

JESSE SEGUNDO a Hispanic man in his late 30s with a mildly ghoulish air

about him

Also in the room are Booth and his partner EARL WHITNEY a thin man in his

late 30’s They listen
to the conversation

JESSE
Soon as they got her on the table
they knew it was murder stroke or
no I mean what was this dumb son
of a bitch thinking Trained
professionals wouldn’t find a needle
mark in her arm
Dwayne leans back and stretches somewhat indifferent to the story -

DWAYNE
Just goes to show you

JESSE
I mean at least pick a more discreet
place the scalp under the armpit
under the tongue someplace where the
trained eye won’t immediately look

Jesse wipes his forehead with his HANDKERCHIEF -

JESSE
Damn it’s hot in here

DWAYNE
He probably figured she was on her
way out anyhow no drugs in her
system no foul play

JESSE
Dwayne I’m telling you a coroner has
the skills and abilities to determine
those things If you pump air into
someone’s vein a series of traumas
occur that are clearly visible upon
dissection

Dwayne looks at Booth and Earl who crack faint
smiles -

JESSE
Very clumsy very clumsy I’d have
found it in a minute

DWAYNE
All right you’re the super sleuth
what do you want a medal

JESSE
No
(smiles)
But what I would like is the forty
dollars you owe me and I’m a busy
man

DWAYNE
Dammit you’re persistent I don’t
want to listen to this anymore No
more bets with you

Dwayne takes out his CHECKBOOK - Jesse seems put off by
this -

JESSE
Aw now that’s gonna take time to
clear

DWAYNE
(writing)
Take it or leave it

Booth and Earl seem amused by this encounter -

BOOTH
So what was your point Jesse

JESSE
My point My point is that by
analyzing all the various ways by
which we kill each other it seems
to me there is no perfect crime
We’1l get ya somehow some way
Except maybe if you use
potassium of something

BOOTH
Huh

Jesse looks at the two me with a comically steely
expression -

JESSE
Easy to purchase hard to detect
Too much potassium can kill a man

EARL
(laughs)
You must get a lot of babes with
lines like that

Everyone laughs but Jesse --

DWAYNE
I think you need to get away from
all those stiffs Find yourself a
little senorita of your own

An awkward beat as Jesse stares at the floor Dwayne picks it up
DWAYNE
Do you even have a girlfriend
Jesse
JESSE
Sort of

Dwayne gets up grabbing his lunch box --

DWAYNE
Sort of

BOOTH
Hey Dwayne why dont you introduce
him to your funeral parlor cousin

Dwayne sucks on his teeth for a beat From his expression its clear he
doesnt want
Jesses blood in the family line

DWAYNE
Shes not his type

JESSE
Yeah Thats all I need to become
one of your in-laws

Dwayne then grabs his coat off the rack and begins to head out --
DWAYNE
I’m out of here

Jesse stands up -

DWAYNE
All right deputies take care
dont let your meat loaf

EARL
Dont worry the real men are in
charge now

DWAYNE
Speaking of which that reminds
me I have to bring something home
or eat Sallys meatloaf again and
I dont think I could stand that

JESSE
Youre always griping Cut her
some slack

Dwayne heads out -- Booth watches him leave --
DWAYNE
Youve never had it
(emphatically)

Its exactly like dog food
Earl laughs Booth gives a courtesy smile

EARL
Ready to roll partner

BOOTH
Sure thing and --

Booth slaps an envelope into Earls hand --

BOOTH
Dont spend it all in one place

EARL
I knew youd come through
Jesse observes the transaction Booth and Earl start to leave

JESSE
Whats that all about

Booth turns to Jesse as he heads out behind Earl --

BOOTH
Drug deal Pay it no mind

Jesse watches them leave --

Suddenly Booth sees something up ahead his expression changes --

BOOTH

POV WILLIE lies in the road --
EXT HIGHWAY - NIGHT

Booth and Earl get out and run over to the body which has left a trail of
blood --

Earl looks around with his flashlight -- then sees something up the road --

EARL

Get the car
Earl starts walking down the road --

Booth watches him then stands up startled by what he
sees --

EXT GAS STATION - NIGHT

The patrol car headlines illuminate the scene of the
crime --

Bodies everywhere blood broken glass --

Earl shines his mag light around the scene as Booth gets out of the car --

BOOTH

(shocked)

What the hell
EARL

Arizona plates

Earl heads over to the back of the Mercedes The trunk is still open --

Booth goes down and checks the pulse of another dead
gunman --
BOOTH

at WHAT HE SEES

Booth gets up looks around checks another ones pulse --

Earl and Booth look at each other --

BOOTH
This is crazy

The two stare at the money in startled silence for a beat --

BOOTH

Booth heads off as Earl pulls out a CIGARETTE out of a pack and lights it

He thinks for a moment then drops the cigarette and stomps it calling after
Booth

EARL

hastily --

Suddenly the air is pierced by the SOUND OF PHLEGMY

CHOKING --

Booth and Earl freeze --

EARL

inspired -
What the hell was that
The two men look around -- the sound is coming from behind the Mercedes --

Earl and Booth runs over and stop dead in their tracks --

DENNING has rolled over on to his back struggling to breathe -- his eyes are
clear as he
stares back at the two men -- he tries to speak but it is more of an agonized
gurgle -

EARL

Can you hear me

Denning struggles to talk but cant he nods --
BOOTH
(panicked)

Oh shit
Earl gets down closer to Denning --

Booth and Earl look at each other --
Then Booth looks around him anxiously panic beginning to form in his
Hes beginning
to understand what Earl means
EARL

BOOTH

Earl looks at Denning who looks pleadingly back at him --

Denning begins to struggle --

EARL

Booth hesitates

EARL
Come on Booth
Finally Booth restrains Denning while Earl
on Dennings face
Booth turns his head away

Denning struggles violently --

The men struggle to suffocate Denning -- then Booth perks up

Soon the faint sound of SIRENS gets louder

BOOTH

presses down with all his might

hears something
Theyre coming
HIGH SHOT - A small group of lights closes on the gas station --
Earl hears the sirens and furiously crushes the coat down on Dennings face -
- but Denning

keeps fighting --

EARL
Dammit

The LIGHTS of the cars soon are visible to both of them --

An AMBULANCE is followed by a PATROL CAR and a FIRE
ENGINE --

In the nick of time Earl rips the coat away and lays it out on the ground --
Booth looks over his shoulder to see the oncoming vehicles -

Earl pulls Denning onto the coat as the vehicles pull up --
The PARAMEDIC runs over to Earl --

PARAMEDIC
What do we have

EARL
Uh we got a live one here
shot in the throat --

PARAMEDIC
Clear me

Earl stands up and looks down at Denning --
Denning stares back up at him the hate in his eyes going to glass --

PARAMEDIC
Wheres the ambu bag

Dwayne Hogan gets out of the patrol car with Jesse --

He approaches Booth as another PARAMEDIC assists the first in stabilizing
Denning --

DWAYNE
What the hell happened here

BOOTH
Looks like some kind of drug
deal or something theyre not

(looking back at Denning)
one of thems still alive

Earl stands above the paramedics --
PARAMEDIC

EARL
Uh well he sort of moved himself

Fireman douse the car as Dwayne Jesse and Booth approach Earl --
Booth and Earl play it cool as the paramedics work --
PARAMEDIC

backboard as they use
a resuscitating bag to give him oxygen --

The paramedics hoist Denning up and toward the ambulance --

The paramedics continue in vain --
Earl watches clutching his fists at his side --

PARAMEDIC 2
Hes not going to make it --

In another part of the crime scene Dwayne aims his flashlight at the ground

looking for clues -

his eyes seem to display a keen ability to find inconsistencies -

Soon he nears the spot where Denning relieved himself
flashlight down -

He locates some FOOTPRINTS those of Denning leading
into the grass -

Dwayne notices the footprints and aims his flashlight
nothing
he turns the light off and heads back to the others -

Dwayne approaches Booth Jesse and the paramedic ---

- he shines his

away from the scene

into the grass - seeing
Earl and Booth look at each other --

Earl is sitting with Dwayne and an attractive woman in her late 30s ELLEN
MARTIN --

DWAYNE

Booth approaches --

DWAYNE

MARTIN
I wanted to ask you some questions
about last night

BOOTH

Earl pulls out his menthol cigarettes and lights one up --

MARTIN
Would you mind not smoking

Earl looks at Dwayne and Booth then back at Martin -

EARL
No problem

Earl drops the cigarette on the ground --

MARTIN
Thank you

Now do you remember seeing any
vehicles traveling near the site
on your way to or from

BOOTH

MARTIN
Because someone may have gotten

EARL

DWAYNE
We had hounds down at the scene

And there were no other tire
tracks in the vicinity

Martin looks at the men

DWAYNE
Dennings their man on the

He was deep undercover with these
dealers for a while They ran a
big operation in Arizona Nevada
California

play it cool as Dwayne listens to Martin captivated

the worst shape of all sickened by the revelation

MARTIN
Normally we would have tracked him
with a wiretap but it was standard
for him to occasionally drop out
when working with these guys The
last we heard from him was two days
ago

BOOTH
You mean that guy was an agent

MARTIN
Yes Wife anda kid
(Beat)
Dont blame yourself Deputy You
did all you could You have our
deepest gratitudeand my personal
thanks

Booth
A pregnant pause envelopes the room --

MARTIN

In fact Ive asked Sheriff Hogan
for permission to enter a
letter of commendation in each
of your files

(beat)
Agent Denning was a good man
I served with him for nearly
five years

Booth looks at Earl hard Earl decides to break the silence

EARL
So I guess we wont find out
what happened

Martin gets up --

MARTIN
Well we have one lead and thats
what Im looking into next

BOOTH

MARTIN
Denning was wearing a bug

Booth and Earl look at each other -- Dwayne gets up

Sally wraps her arms around Booth kissing him deeply Then she looks down

(coldly)

Im not letting some gangbanger

BOOTH (VO)
What are you thinking

EARL (VO)

As the camera continues to pan we see the voices are coming from a small TAPE
RECORDER --
BOOTH (VO)
Youre thinking about killing him
I cant do that No way Ive
never killed a man Never even
shot at one

EARL (VO)
Well neither have I but its us

EARL (VO)

Soon a hand approaches the recorder --

BOOTH (VO)

crime scene You know what theyd

BOOTH (VO)
He would have done it to us right

The hand shuts off the tape and we see the listener is Jesse the coroner
who has a determined

look in his glassy eyes as he takes a swig of BOURBON --

FADE OUT
FADE IN

INT GARAGE -- DAY

The burned-out Mercedes sits in the center of the room --
Ellen Martin looks at it with forensic expert JOE WALLACE

wearing thick glasses --

WALLACE
You want to hear the good news
first or the bad news

MARTIN
Give me the bad news

WALLACE
We retrieved a few things from the
trunk including a steamer trunk

or the remnants of a trunk the
brass clips and so forth

MARTIN
Anything in it

WALLACE
Money

Martin looks at Wallace --

Again

WALLACE
But nowhere near three million
dollars worth I would say
maybe twenty thousand

MARTIN
(bluntly)
There was more than that

WALLACE
Not in the trunk

MARTIN
That doesnt tell us much Did
you run a check on the gas like
I told you

WALLACE
Yeah we did It was unleaded
high octane

MARTIN
Sowhats the good news

MARTIN
The cars a diesel

Martin looks at Wallace -

a man

in his

40s
WALLACE
That fire was set Deliberately
And probably not by anyone found
at the scene

MARTIN
So someone did get away

WALLACE
I dont know how else youd explain
it The coroners estimated time of
death for everyone there was long
before this fire started unless of
course Denning started it and that
doesnt make much sense

MARTIN
No it doesnt Neither does his
blank tape Any news on that

WALLACE

Were doing a check on the
manufacturers serial number see
if there were other defective tapes
in the bunch

(Beat)
Whats your take on these local
boys Are they providing any
answers

Martin seems deep in thought -- a skeptical look crosses her eyes --

MARTIN
No I dont think they see much
of this kind of thing
(Beat)
But theyre going to

DISSOLVE
TO
SHERIFFS STATION -- DAY

Jesse looks out the window of the station --

JESSE
I suppose no man can judge anothers
actions unless he has been in the
same situation himself presented
with the same temptations
(beat)
And money sure is tempting Hell
some people will pretty much do
anything for moneylie cheat
steal swindle
Jesse turns and looks --
Booth and Earl listen to him grim expressions on their faces

JESSE

-kill

(beat)
I dont suppose it would be too
hard to kill a man especially if
hes half dead especially if hes
of the criminal persuasion

(beat)
How did you know he was a federal
officer with a wife and a baby on
the way

Earl and Booth say nothing Jesse laughs --

JESSE
You gentlemen look like youre

cookies

BOOTH

JESSE

Jesse gets up --

JESSE
Hey were all friends right

Jesse looks hard at Earl --
JESSE

JESSE

EARL

JESSE

Earl says nothing --

JESSE

sucks up the
overflow --
DWAYNE

Son of a bitch Did you

Sally looks at him and then back at the screen --

SALLY
Careful not to get any on the
floor

Dwayne puts the beer on a table next to his chair --

Dwayne gingerly lowers himself into his chair appearing to have pain in his
lower back -
Dwayne notices whats on TV and seems mildly disappointed --

DWAYNE

Sally watches the luxurious scenes on the TV --

DWAYNE
Is this all thats on

She gets up and hands him the remote --

bit --

Having undressed Sally wraps a towel around her and
the sound of the shower begins --

Dwayne belches loudly -- he then shifts in his chair
really bothering him --

door --

DWAYNE

therapeutic pad thing

SALLY (OS)

DWAYNE

Dwayne checks in a dresser then opens a closet begins to dig through boxes
on a shelf --

Dwayne pulls out a CORD which is attached to a HOT PAD -- as he pulls it out
some articles
fall off the shelf onto the ground including a SHOE BOX --

Dwayne looks at the ground --
A LACE STRAP pokes out of the box -

Dwayne crouches down slowly takes the lid off -- we hear the sound of the
shower stop and

Sally getting out of the

shower --

Dwayne lifts up the EXPENSIVE LINGERIE and looks at it with a frown --

DWAYNE
What the hell

He lifts up the individual garments turning them around --

The bathroom door opens and Sally comes out in a towel and robe -- she
freezes and looks at
Dwayne playing it cool -

Dwayne looks back at her --
Sally approaches him --

SALLY
What are you digging around in my
closet for

DWAYNE
I was looking for the hot pad

Sally goes to grab the lingerie out of Dwaynes hand -- he refuses to let go

DWAYNE
You mind telling me where the hell
this came from
(Beat)
Is there something I dont know
about

Sally looks Dwayne in the eye and fights to be casual acting merely
irritated -

SALLY
What do you mean

Dwayne looks hard at her --

DWAYNE
I mean are you spending my money
on other things I dont know
about Got any furs in there

Mildly relieved Sally grabs the lingerie out of Dwaynes hand and stuffs it
back in the box --

SALLY
Dont be ridiculous It wasnt
so expensive

Sally puts the box back --

SALLY
It was going to be a surprise

DWAYNE
A surprise huh Well I dont like
any surprises especially if
Im forking over the loot for
them

Sally closes the door and looks at him for a beat before laughing weakly and
walking away
from him --

SALLY
Youre a real smooth talker you
know that

Sally goes to the mirror and combs her hair out --

DWAYNE
What are you saying

SALLY
Im saying youre about as romantic
as a bag of sand

DWAYNE
(menacing)
Watch that Watch that tone

Dwayne looks at her with a surly but suspicious expression on his face then
dismisses the
exchange and leaves with his hot pad

When hes gone Sally looks at herself in the mirror with a troubled
expression on her face --

EXT TRAILER HOME -- NIGHTFALL

Booth rifles through the bag --

EARL

Earl looks around --
Booth inspects the money then looks up at Earl -

BOOTH

Slowly a figure emerges from the crowd alone walking dejectedly - it is
Jesse who

walks into the harsh sunlight oblivious to the people around him - he looks

He stands there for a beat then lets out a prolonged defeated sigh -

His PAGER goes off - Jesse reads the number -

about the tape Denning was wearing

(Beat)

Based on the serial number weve
determined that the tape was
purchased locally

Jesse swallows Hard

BOOTH

MARTIN
Its odd I dont know how Denning
had the time or the ability to
buy something local based on his
situation

EARL
Well I suppose you would know
more about his situation than us

Martin stares at Earl --

MARTIN
Maybe Maybe not

DWAYNE
What are you getting at

MARTIN
Well unfortunately Dennings not
here to tell us but I would say
someone got their hands on that tape
and switched it

DWAYNE
Why would someone do that

MARTIN
Because they dont want anyone to
hear whats on it obviously
Martin looks directly at Jesse -- Dwayne turns and does the same --

Jesse looks at them --

Jesse ignores the request pouring himself another drink The bottle shakes
slightly

JESSE

Jesse takes another swig and looks at them --

JESSE

ground --

JESSE

They drag him up on his feet over to a METAL OFFICE CHAIR where they plunk
him down --
Booth gets out some CUFFS --

EARL
I dont suppose youll tell us
where the tape is

JESSE
Well its not here -- youre wasting
your time and youre pissing me off

As Earl restrains Jesse Booth takes one cuff and clamps it around Jesses
wrist and
the arm of the chair -- Jesse winces in pain --

Earl then quickly jams a wooden STICK between Jesse’s teeth and ties the ROPE
on both
ends tightly around the back of Jesse’s head -

JESSE
What the hell

Earl goes over to the bag and pulls out some LAMP CORD which he tosses to
Booth -
Booth takes the cord and quickly begins to secure Jesse to the chair --

JESSE
I dont know what the hell youre
doing but youre as good as dead
now

Spittle runs down Jesse’s chin -

Earl continues to rummage thought the bag -- he pulls out some OBJECTS
wrapped in
plastic and sets them on a table --

Jesse watches Earl --

JESSE
What the hell is this shit

Earl reaches for Jesses pack of cigarettes on the table looks at the brand
with disgust

hrows them on the table -- he fumbles in his pockets and finds one MENTHOL
cigarette left in a soft pack in his shirt pocket -- he hastily stuffs the
pack halfway in his pocket -

EARL
Youre the only person I know on
Earth who smokes this bullshit
brand

Jesse looks on as Earl lights up the cigarette and begins to open the plastic
package

revealing first a SPOON which he places on the table then a SYRINGE - and
then a small

white plastic bottle labeled POTASSIUM -

A look of genuine concern crosses Jesse’s face as he sees the bottle -

JESSE
If anything happens to me I got
people wholl go straight --
(struggling)
straight to a safety deposit box
and theyll find out everything

Booth continues to tie up Jesse as he and Earl look at each other --

BOOTH
You dont expect us to believe
that do you

JESSE
You better believe it if
you know whats good for you

EARL
See thats the problem with you
You got a big mouth A big fat
mouth

Earl takes a spoonful of potassium and holds a LIGHTER over it - the heat

causes a
lavender smoke to rise as the potassium liquefies -

JESSE
Get me out of this Get me out
of this asshole You try
anything youll leave a thousand
clues We find em all the time
Were trained for it

EARL
So are we Jesse

Jesse begins to struggle wildly kicking fiercely -- Booth fights to
stabilize him --

EARL
Dammit settle him down

Booth fights to do so -- he stares at Earl --

Earl fills the syringe hands beginning to shake as he liquid fills the
chamber -

BOOTH

Booth struggles and fails to pull Jesse up -- Earl puts down the syringe and
together
they stand Jesse upright --

Jesse is almost in tears now blood seeps from a cut on his cheek

JESSE

EARL

Earl brings the needle overhe begins to bring it toward the direction of
Jesse’s mouth -

Jesse is coming unglued - Earl stares at him hard -

eyes bulge in fear -

Earl then STABS the needle under Jesse’s tongue - Jesse SCREAMS as Booth
watches with great

apprehension -
BOOTH

JESSE

Earl looks at Jesse then back at Booth - he then removes the needle from
Jesses mouth -

Suddenly Booth slams Earl against the wall - Earls cigarette pack goes
flying --

BOOTH

(under his breath)
We were only supposed to scare
him

EARL

Booth pulls the cassette from the bottom held there by masking tape

BOOTH
Here it is

EARL

JESSE

Earl turns and smiles at Jesse -

EARL
Better safe than sorry

Earl then rapidly and unexpectedly STABS the needle under Jesse’s tongue and
INJECTS the

contents -
Jesse screams then after a second - he JOLTS VIOLENTLY - his eyes roll back
into his head -

BOOTH
Earl

Booth pulls Earl away but its too late The syringe is empty -

Jesse JOLTS violently again and CRASHES to the floor -

The two men stare at Jesse in shocked silence -

Jesse exhales one final time a death gasp from his open drooling mouth -
Booth looks at Earl with a mixture of shock and terror -

EARL
We had no choice

Booth says nothing -

EARL
You know that Deep down you

Booth then turns and looks at Jesse -

EARL

Jesses lifeless eyes stare into the camera his mouth agape his head lying
in a pool of
saliva -- the camera stays with him for a long moment pulling back slowly --

can be heard is the ticking of a CLOCK-
Booth and Earl look down at the body saying nothing -- the camera stays with

protest --
