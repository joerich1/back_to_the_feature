We hear a strange single BENT NOTE

EXT SHARECROPPER SHACK - ECU FINGERS - LATE AFTERNOON 1
We follow a small boys FINGERS on a strange contraption-

WIDER

SCRATCH 10 years old has a “DIDDLEY BOW a piece of baling
wire nailed to the side of the unpainted shack so it is
stretched taut He moves an old corn cob under it as a fret
and makes TWANGY pitch-shifting NOTES as he plucks the wire

His friend LONNIE stands moving his fingers over a BOARD he
has laid on the side of the porch floor A few scrawny
CHICKENS run around in the yard behind them-

LONNIE
Leave off with that Scratch

SCRATCH
Aint bothering you

LONNIE
Yes it is That aint no kind of
music

We see that the board has PIANO KEYS drawn across it and that
Lonnie is pretending to play a song on it-

SCRATCH
Least I make a sound

LONNIE
Yeah and its a nasty one

Lonnie looks at the sky-
SCRATCH
You want to try again tonight

Lonnie sits on the edge of the porch gauging the time from
the setting sun-

LONNIE
Might as well

EXT 1ST COTTON FIELD - LATE AFTERNOON
SLIDE GUITAR plays A tuft of RAW COTTON bobs on the stem
and we begin to scroll OPENING CREDITS-

We TILT and RACK to look over a FIELD OF COTTON the bolls
plumped out and ready for picking blowing in the breeze

A HARVEST HAND steps into the shot looks toward the setting
sun wipes his face with a bandanna then stoops to pick the
row in front of him We PULL BACK to see other PICKERS men
and women in denim coveralls old gingham dresses and hard
work shoes wearing straw hats against the sun and trailing
LONG WHITE SACKS between their legs and behind them

The boys walk down between them in the opposite direction-

EXT COUNTRYSIDE - PINEY WOODS - LATE AFTERNOON
MUSIC CONTINUES We see the boys walking on a PATH through
the PINES-

EXT COUNTRYSIDE RAILROAD TRACKS - AERIAL SHOT - LATE
AFTERNOON

MUSIC CONTINUES We float over RAILROAD TRACKS cutting
through flat piney woods catching up the boys who walk on
the ties-

EXT ARMY BARRACKS - EARLY EVENING

MUSIC CONTINUES The boys stroll past white buildings of an
ARMY BARRACKS SOLDIERS black and white DRILL on the
grounds-

EXT RAILROAD BRIDGE RIVER - EARLY EVENING
The river rolls past us in the FG as the boys cross a
RAILROAD BRIDGE We SUPERIMPOSE-
ALABAMA - 1950

OPENING CREDITS END

EXT HONEYDRIPPER LOUNGE - NIGHT

We hear PIANO MUSIC as we CRANE DOWN toward the HONEYDRIPPER

LOUNGE a ramshackle wooden roadhouse at a rural crossroads

BLUE-colored light bulbs (a few broken) FLICK ON and OFF
erratically around the HONEYDRIPPER SIGN as we TRACK toward
and then THROUGH it on the way to the entrance catching up
with Lonnie and Scratch

The boys step under the door-light frantic with insects and
go up on their toes to peek in through a window-

INT HONEYDRIPPER - NIGHT
An OVERHEAD ANGLE of long fingers on piano keys-

SINGER

A woman in her late 50s early 60s BERTHA MAE SPIVEY
leans into a MICROPHONE from where she sits on a stool ona
little makeshift stage a glass of whiskey in hand and SINGS-

BERTHA MAE
I know a gal name of Betty Sue
Shook it so much
She got the German flu
No matter how she done it
No matter how she done it
No matter how she done it
She done it just the same

As she sings we PAN and TRACK moving through the large near-
empty COUNTRY ROADHOUSE-

BERTHA MAE
You women dont worry
About your life
She made Jack the Ripper
Throw away his knife-
Only a few die-hard REGULARS are scattered at the tables and

bar stools A pretty young woman in her late teens CHINA
DOLL is behind the bar head held in her hands listening
aimlessly

BERTHA MAE
No matter how she done it
No matter how she done it
No matter how she done it
She done it just the same

Lonnie and Scratch step in cautiously looking around hoping

that nobody will notice and tell them to leave

They plant themselves next to the piano Lonnie intently
watching the long fingers work the keys- we TILT to see
TYRONE “Pinetop Purvis proprietor and piano player in his
50s He acts as if the boys arent there concentrating on
the music We SHIFT to include Bertha Mae as she wraps up
the song-

BERTHA MAE

A copper brought her in
She didnt need no bail
She shook it for the judge
He threw the cop in jail
No matter how she done it
No matter how she done it
No matter how she done it
She done it just the same

SLICK a pretty sharply-dressed man in his late 40s at the
bar and MACEO who sits at a table near the bandstand
smiling throughout APPLAUD The sound makes the room seem
more empty

Ty stands nods to METALMOUTH SIMS a slight worried-looking
harmonica player who sits behind Bertha Mae-

TY
You take it for a while

As Ty crosses to the bar we hear RECORDED MUSIC booming from
outside-

BERTHA MAE
They makin all that racket again at
Toussaints
TY
Yeah And all them people over
there buying drinks and throwing
their money after them dice and
whatnot Lucky we got none a that
here

Metalmouth launches into a HARMONICA INTRO Ty pauses at the
counter next to Slick who is attentively watching Bertha Mae-

BERTHA MAE
You can drink your liquor
You can drink your cold can beer-

SLICK
She sounding good huh

TY

BERTHA MAE

You can drink your good whiskey
You can drink your cold can beer-

SLICK

TY

SLICK

attraction like Bertha Mae-

BERTHA MAE

TY

Maceo arrives to join them interrupting-

MACEO

MACEO

China Doll brings Ty a glass of whiskey He gives her a sad
smile-

HONEYDRIPPER
Ty reacts Behind him Maceo indicates the near-empty room-

MACEO

STOKELY a bitter drunk who holds on to the end of the bar
calls out to them-

STOKELY

preacher

Slick tenses used to this-

STOKELY
Cause he does all his best work on
his knees

Stokely almost chokes with laughter-

MACEO

STOKELY

and use it to yank him around the
house

Slick starts to rise but Maceo puts a hand on his arm-

Bertha Mae is singing straight to Slick now as Metalmouth
backs her up on the harmonica-

BERTHA MAE

Bertha Mae a little unsteady holds onto Slicks arm as he
helps her off the stage-

after them troubled while Ty pours himself another drink-

MACEO

MACEO

Maceo crosses and plugs an ancient-looking tabletop JUKEBOX
in

The jukebox sputters to life LIGHTS FLASHING ON and MUSIC
BLARING for a moment then the LIGHTS FLICKER and all the
POWER in the club goes OFF

EXT HONEYDRIPPER - NIGHT 9

Maceo rolls his eyes as he passes Ty on the way out with a
FLASHLIGHT He freezes in his tracks as the FLASHLIGHT BEAM
hits a FIGURE standing in the doorway-

It is SHERIFF HIRAM PUGH large and in charge Pugh strolls
into the club as if he owns it

China Doll looks from Sheriff Pugh to Tys face
for a flicker of evidence Ty stays deadpan-

TY

of menace in his voice when he speaks softly-

SHERIFF PUGH

A long TRAIN WHISTLE echoes outside-

EXT BERTHA MAES HOUSE - NIGHT 11
Bertha Mae pauses as she climbs the FRONT PORCH of her two-
story wooden HOUSE the nicest in the neighborhood listening
to the TRAIN WHISTLE with a troubled look on her face Slick
waits for her with the door open-

EXT RAILROAD STATION - NIGHT 12
We hear the TRAIN WHISTLE again as the WHEELS ROLL and the
TRAIN strobes past us picking up speed as it pulls out from
the yard-

When it clears we see a LONE FIGURE standing across the
tracks He steps forward and catches a bit of light--

SONNY BLAKE 20s rumpled from hard travelling He carries
a GUITAR CASE and something bulky in a SACK-

SHACK THOMAS an older man in a PULLMAN PORTERS UNIFORM

15 EXT TOWN - TRAIN TRACKS - EARLY MORNING 15

A WIDE SHOT of the TRACKS that cut the town in two

CLOSER

Sonny stands on the tracks just as the SUN RISES pondering-
which side of the tracks is for white people which for the
colored

He hears GUITAR MUSIC to one side steps cautiously toward it-

16 EXT MAIN STREET - GENERAL STORE - EARLY MORNING 16
Sonny wanders down the street lugging his sack and case
moving toward the sound of a SLIDE GUITAR being played
expertly-

An irate-looking WHITE LADY glares at Sonny as she picks up
the milk bottles from her stoop steps inside and slams the
door Sonny moves ahead uneasy-

We TIGHTEN on his face as he stops to listen the MUSIC
ECHOING seeming to come from here then from there then
suddenly from right behind him-

He turns-

POSSUM blind with his chair tilted back against the not-yet-
open GENERAL STORE PLAYS expertly on a beat-up old GUITAR
Sonny lays his case down to listen for a moment watching the
mans fingers-

Possum gets a whiff of him He keeps playing as he speaks-—
POSSUM
Somebody slept in the railroad
yard

Sonny watches the blind mans fingers move on the strings-

SONNY
Yall can play that thing

POSSUM

SONNY

POSSUM
The wrong side for you

SONNY

surprised at the blind mans perception-

wanders in crossing to the liquor cabinet-

AMANDA

Oh dear I believe its about that
time-
She pulls out a DECANTER OF WINE-

AMANDA

Would you care to join me

DELILAH
No thank you

Amanda pours herself a glass of wine-

AMANDA

Of course you wont join me

thoughtless of me

DELILAH
Thats all right

AMANDA

So you dont take spirits and- what

DELILAH

Im sort of between churches right

changing over to the Holin

AMANDA

DELILAH

Theres been a minister in this

week-—

AMANDA

Delilah nods Amanda takes a drink

AMANDA

ess

but

I- I havent been sanctified yet

The tent out by the fairgrounds

The church I grew up in- we were
Pentacostals- they wouldnt have
anything but the human voice inside
the church And dancing- any kind
of dancing music card playing--

well it was very strict
took up serpents

They

DELILAH
Ive heard of that

AMANDA
I tell Floyd these stories and hes
horrified Theyve always been
Methodists Floyds family

DELILAH
Theyre good people too

AMANDA
When I married Floyd-- oh it was
quite a scandal among my relatives
As if Id taken up with somebody in
a cult

DELILAH
It can be a trial married folks
differ in their religion

AMANDA
And your husband is a---

DELILAH
Unaffiliated

AMANDA
Unaffiliated I see He has his--
social club-

DELILAH
The Honeydripper

AMANDA
Such a colorful name

DELILAH
Yes

AMANDA
He must devote a great deal of his
energy to it

DELILAH
Its just him and Maceo Green runs
it and then I go over and cook
some when I get off here

AMANDA
Thats very- supportive of you
Considering the sort of-
environment—

barrooms most of my life Miss
Amanda

Amanda realizes she has probed too deep tries to back up-

AMANDA
I see-

DELILAH
I was a singer I met Tyrone in
the Paradise down in Shreveport
China Doll was only two-

Delilah considers struggling to express who Ty is-

DELILAH
I was just kind of livin along you
know drinking more than I ought--
then Tyrone It was like a light
come into my life

Delilah turns away embarrassed to have revealed so much-

DELILAH
People think things because he owns
the Lounge but they dont know

him

AMANDA
Small minds are never in short
supply

She crosses to look out a window-

AMANDA
The people in this town---

She catches herself smiles-

AMANDA
I suppose they expected that Floyd
being from a prominent family- as
prominent as is possible here in
Harmony- would have chosen somebody
more--

She fades away again empties her glass-

AMANDA
My people were very devout but
they werent- financially
successful

DELILAH
No shame in that

AMANDA
In school if you didnt have shoes-

She frowns at the memory sighs-

AMANDA
Oh I forgot--

Amanda is up and out of the room Delilah frowns at the
decanter hurries to put it away

Amanda comes back in holding a DRESS for a young girl-

AMANDA
I was going through Emilys old
things the other day and I thought
this would look just darling on
your China Doll-

Delilah examines the dress which is clearly for a little
girl-

DELILAH
Oh- I dont think it would near fit
her Miss Amanda

AMANDA
(disappointed) How old is she now

DELILAH
Seventeen

AMANDA
(shocked) Oh my- I must have lost
track somewhere along the line
Seventeen

She sits still holding the dress sneaks a look over to
where the wine decanter was-

DELILAH
It was a very nice thought

An awkward silence that Perry Como fills inadequately A
KNOCK at the back door then China Doll steps in not seeing
Amanda right away-

CHINA DOLL
Mama They need you at-

Delilah shifts her eyes to indicate-

CHINA DOLL
Oh Im sorry Miss Amanda I
didnt know you was home

AMANDA

recalling- you used to play right

He touches it with a finger-

SLICK

EXT REVIVAL TENT - NIGHT - WIDE SHOT 39
A CHOIR sings at the front of the LANTERN-LIT tent a
CONGREGATION of salvation-seekers filling the benches-

CHOIR
Mother died-
Yes she died and left me
It was long- long time ago
Oh but I searched
Searched her record over
I found mother just had to go

UNDER TENT

CHOIR
Oh she cried son
Son dont you worry
Oh you know the Lord
Always fix a way

Delilah arrives at the rear of the tent finds herself a spot
on a bench-

CHOIR
She left me standing
Standing along the highway
Oh wondering- which way I must go

REVEREND CUTLIP watches his singers clapping out time with
his big hands-

CHOIR
As I walked-
All along the highway
I was seeking my Lord each day
She left me standing
Standing along the highway
Just wondering- which way must I
go

“Amens and other sounds greet the end of the song Reverend
Cutlip steps to the center of the platform and looks around
at the souls gathered-

REVEREND CUTLIP
The Highway of Life Brothers and
Sisters will twist you and turn
you it will run you this way and
that way it will tempt you with
many a detour-- for the Highway of
Life Brothers and Sisters is
designed to lead us astray

He gets an “Amen from someone in the crowd-

REVEREND CUTLIP
It meanders away from the Light and
into the Darkness it tires our
legs and whittles away at our
spirits

The congregation start to get into it RESPONDING rocking
with the rhythm of the sermon flapping their PAPER FANS that
advertise Beauchamps Funeral Home in the hot night--

REVEREND CUTLIP
It snares us with the thorns and
thistles of wickedness it is paved
with the black deeds of sinners and
laid out on a crooked plan Thats
not the road we want to be on
Brothers and Sisters thats not
the path we need to follow

The Reverend picks up speed-

REVEREND CUTLIP
We got to get on that other road
The one that leads to salvation
The one that leads to glory The
one that leads to the right hand of
God Praise His name

CONGREGATION
Praise the Lord

REVEREND CUTLIP
The thoroughfare Im talking about
the righteous path we got to tread
is called the Highway to Heaven
and by the great Lord above it is
straight and it is narrow

(MORE)

REVEREND CUTLIP (contd)
Keep your eyes on the prize and
your feet on the street and you
wont ever make a mis-step you
wont ever falter you wont ever
stumble because Jesus will show
you the Way

Several people in the audience are up and SHOUTING now
getting into the Spirit Reverend Cutlip shifts gear
filling his voice with a sense of dread and warning-

REVEREND CUTLIP
But you got to pay attention to who
it is walking beside you Brothers
and Sisters got to be wary against
those who will hold you back from
your journey Theres many a loved
one got to be left behind Cause
you either on the road or you lost
in the wilderness

DELILAH

We TIGHTEN on Delilah as she listens upset taking this all
very personally-

REVEREND CUTLIP (0S)
You either headed for glory or
doomed to damnation You either in
with the Lord or you in with the
Devil- and they aint no in-between

Sonny begins to SING softly almost to himself-

SONNY
Well you wake up in the morning

Walk up to the table

Knife a fork and a pan
If you say a thing about it

The men join him on the chorus-

ALL

Shine its light on me
Oh let the Midnight Special
Shine its ever-lovin light on me-

Sonny turns to face them-

NED

SONNY

Singer guitar player- Imonna be on

NED
(chuckles) Keep thinkin that way

Sonny ponders this looking back out through the bars
singing more moodily now as we TRACK AWAY from the cell-

SONNY
If you ever go to Houston
Dont you stagger dont you fight
Cause the Sheriff will arrest you
Youre in the cooler for the night-

The piano was just sittin there in

twenty times a day running the
corner of his eye over it And
hes there when they play the
masters doin all their minuets and

Ty looks at Sonny considers telling him what the plan is-

TY
No- I dont spose you will

behind the counter and snaking off in every direction He
grabs hold of one thinking-

INT PURVIS HOUSE - KITCHEN 59
Delilah is in her kitchen HUMMING a GOSPEL SONG to herself

a small CLOTH PURSE She picks it up to put it aside then

frowns at the way it feels She shakes flour off unzips it-

Nothing inside

onto the stage

TY
Oh Lord-

Ty runs up to his microphone shoots a look to the bar-

Maceo is pouring a scotch with one hand the other wrapped
around the wires coming out of the wall He nods to Ty-

Sonny starts to hook his guitar up with a thick COIL OF WIRE
then into the dented AMP sitting on a wooden chair beside him
and pointed out at the crowd Metalmouth Sims looks on
uncomfortably Ty puts on his biggest grin easing behind

the keyboard-

TY
So heres what you all been waitin

on his head exuding his no-sweat attitude Beside him is
YOUNG HENRY a kid who cant be more than 14 wearing a
fedora-

-direct from New Orleans Louisiana-
STAGE

TY
-Guitar Sam
A TERRIBLE SQUAWK emits from the amp as Sonny makes the
connection-

Sheriff Pugh cover his ears-

The girls from the store cover their ears making pained
faces-

Sonny pulls his guitar away from the amp and the SQUAWK
settles to a FUZZY BUZZ Sonny frowns at the amp-

SONNY
Sorry folks- must of got kicked on
the train

The audience is stone-faced Could this really be the man

Young Henry steps up and sits behind the DRUM KIT pulling
sticks from inside his shirt-

Ty closes his eyes begins to shake his head in defeat-

China Doll looks worried collecting another cover charge at
the door-

Delilah steps out from the kitchen and looks to the stage
worried-

Sonny holds his arms out wide shifting his body to get the
BUZZ under control-

Dex leans to talk in Junebugs ear-
DEX

Whats this fool playin at

Maceo isnt going to wait to find out He grabs the wires
with both hands yanks- they hold firm He looks to the
stage panicked-

-as Sonny brings his fingers to the strings and the amp
BLASTS the room with a long trip-hammering spine-shivering
ELECTRIC GUITAR INTRO

Ty stands at the piano with his mouth hanging open-

Sonny WHOOPS and leans into his microphone-
SONNY
Gonna hold may baby as tight as I

Tonight shell know Im a mighty
man

Sonny looks over to Ty who catches himself and begins to
play along Young Henry is impassive as he plays a fast
shuffle on the skins-

Ty looks over to Maceo half-climbing the wall as he tries to
pull the wires out Maceo sees Ty who waves him off-

SONNY
Have you heard the news
Theres good rockin tonight

Delilah smiles and presses her hands together shooting a
look upward-

DELILAH
Thank you Jesus

Time Trenier has his case open now the gleaming instrument
in one hand squinting at the mouthpiece as he holds it up to
the light with the other-

SONNY
Meet me at midnight behind the barn
Dont you worry Ill do you no harm

The crowd is already CLAPPING and STOMPING in time with the
song Henry starts to hit the two and the four beat hard to
keep time-

SONNY
Make sure to bring my rockin shoes
Tonight Im gonna rock away all of
my blues

Time Trenier screws the mouthpiece on puts his horn to his
lips and BLOWS right on the beat to take the sax break
walking through the parting crowd to the bandstand

Junebug grabs Opals hand and they begin to DANCE a modified
jitterbug people spreading to give them room-

Sheriff Pugh hands still over his ears sits in a corner
paying special attention to Opals hip action-

As Time continues to blow stepping up onto the stage Sonny
keeps urging Metalmouth Sims to come closer to his microphone
with the harmonica Sims is hesitant but Sonny keeps waving-
closer closer-

Metalmouth shoots a nervous look to Ty who nods from the
piano so he butts his harp smack against the microphone
takes a deep breath and HONKS his soul out grabbing the
break from Time

The audience goes wild a half-dozen couples dancing now
others clapping and finger-popping and jumping to the beat
where they stand Sonny shakes out the long CORD attached to
his guitar-

China Doll is trying to keep collecting from the new
CUSTOMERS pressing in the door and dance at the same time
thrilled by the music Lonnie and Scratch sneak in behind
her as she turns toward the bandstand-

Metalmouth wraps up his break and Sonny takes over with the
guitar again making it WAIL as he hops off the stage steps
up on a chair then onto the bar counter

He walks the length of the bar playing his ass off hops
down at the far end grins at China Doll and heads out
through the door dragging extension cord behind Lonnie and
Scratch hurry to pull slack for him as he steps out into the
NIGHT-

EXT ACE OF SPADES - NIGHT 72
Ham and a few other pickers stand outside Toussaints beers

in hand staring across toward the Honeydripper as Sonny

steps out PLAYING with a CROWD behind him-

HAM
What the hell is that

Sonny steps out into the middle of the crossroads and plays
a CAR stopping short of running him over

He hops up on the hood and keeps playing a TRUCK from the
other direction stopping to blast him with its HEADLIGHTS

Sonny indicates with his guitar neck to the CROWD emptying
out of Toussaints that he wants them to follow then hops

down onto a big pickers back and is carried back in to the
Honeydripper still playing-

HAM
We got to check that out

A couple dozen patrons move away with him We HOLD on the
doorway as OLD MAN TOUSSAINT comes out to look puzzled and
angry-

INT HONEYDRIPPER - NIGHT
Time and Metalmouth SING into the same microphone as Sonny
plays his way back up to the stage-

TIME AND METALMOUTH
Have you heard the news

Have you heard the news

We FOLLOW as Maceo hustles back and forth trying to keep up
with orders for ribs bring cold beers out from the icebox

Nadine stands before him looking fatally sexy in a SATIN
DRESS she no doubt made herself

MACEO
Oh my soul

NADINE

MACEO

He hurries past with his arms full of beer pivoting to check
her out from another angle-

Dex sees across the room frowns-

Ham is talking to Lucille at the bar leaning in close to be
heard over the music-

SONNY
I heard the news-
Theres good rockin tonight

Sonny finishes with a squawking chord and the joint goes wild-
CHEERING WHISTLING STOMPING

SONNY
Alla you men grab hold of a woman
You cant find a woman just grab
hold of yourselves- we gonna play
this one slow and tight

Sonny goes into the intro for Louis Jordans Blue Light
Boogie Time lays down a steady rock beat with his sax and
Ty joins in at the piano-

SONNY
They did the boogie real slow
With the blue lights way down low
They did the boogie real slow
With the blue lights way down low

Ty joins him-

SONNY AND TY
They did the boogie real slow
With the blue lights way down low

Ty takes the verse-

TY
I went to a party
With a bobby sox
I started swingin
All she would do was rock

As they join in the chorus Ty sees-

Cool Breeze strolling in checking out the action with a
proprietary air

Ty looks to Maceo getting back behind the bar Maceo sees
as well tightening up-

Cool Breeze nods to Ty
A slow sexy SAX BREAK comes up and Ty leaves the piano to
cross to the bar When he gets there Maceo is already

counting out a huge pile of BILLS-

MACEO
Hundred forty-two forty-three
forty-four five six seven
eight nine- hundred fifty And
theys another fifty in here-

Maceo thunks a heavy CLOTH SACK full of change onto the
countertop-

MACEO
Lucky Hardaway dont mind some
change does he

Cool Breeze doesnt even glance at the money hard-eying Ty
instead-

COOL BREEZE
What if Mr Hardaway was to say let
the chumps keep their change he
wants the club back one way or the
other

Maceo looks to Ty who remains impassive mind working-

COOL BREEZE
Howd that be

TY
Well- hed have to take it up with
my bidness partner

Ty shifts and we RACK FOCUS to see across the room to Sheriff
Pugh receiving his sack of chicken and white bread from
Delilah Ty smiles and waves-

Cool Breeze reconsiders his terms-

COOL BREEZE
That sheriff your partner

TY
(sighs) Yeah and hes twice as
mean as he is ugly

Cool Breeze grins scoops up the bills on the counter-

COOL BREEZE
You must want this club awful bad
brother

Cool Breeze hefts the sack of change shoots a look to the
stage and leans over to speak into Tys ear-

COOL BREEZE
You maybe know this already but
that aint no Guitar Sam

He steps away just as the song ends to APPLAUSE Ty taking a
deep sigh of relief Sonny steps up to the microphone to
introduce the next song-

TOUSSAINT (0S)
You is a lie

A shocked silence

The audience makes way for Old Man Toussaint to come
tottering up to the foot of the stage He points a bony
finger at Sonny-

TOUSSAINT
You is a lie boy I known Sammy
since hes drinkin mamas milk
hell I known his Mama herself when
she live up to Plaquemine- and you
aint him

The audience looks to Sonny for his defense-

Ty holds his breath Maceo brings the baseball bat up from
behind the bar

Sonny just smiles-

SONNY
Thats Creole Guitar Sam you talkin
bout Pops Im Delta Guitar Sam

Toussaint ponders this a moment then huffs-

TOUSSAINT
As long as we straight on that

JUNEBUG
Get on outa there and let the man
play

A CHORUS of CRIES to the same effect and Sonny crosses back
to his microphone-

SONNY
Imonna play you one I come up with
today while I was havin my hair cut-

He starts into a bouncy INTRO that Metalmouth joins in with
then starts to SING as the crowd starts to dance and clap-

SONNY
Oh China Doll

Oh China Doll
I cant get you offa my mind
If you be my baby

The front row is all girls goggling at Sonny instant

drawn toward the stage-
SONNY

Oh China Doll

Oh China Doll

Time Trenier steps in for a growling SAX BREAK-

TY

Ty looks around the crowded rocking room-

POV - SHERIFF PUGH

The Sheriff makes his way through the crowd and out the door
The last person he passes turns toward Ty-

Possum

But then DANCERS cross in front and he is gone

TY

Ty frowns troubled Under the sax now we hear a dissonant
SLIDE GUITAR the haunting notes Possum was playing at the
train station Ty searches the crowd-
POV

The SLIDE GUITAR continues underneath as we PAN across the
crowd dancing-

Theres Possum again at the bar face turned toward Ty

TY

We TIGHTEN on TY Why is he here

POV - POSSUM

Possum turns his head slowly fixes on something and we PAN
to see Dex and Ham standing toe-to-toe snarling into each
others face

We PUNCH IN tighter and tighter on the young men body
language telling us a fight is about to break out-

ECU TY

Ty desperately pushes his way across the crowded floor to
reach them and the FLASHBACKS come again the SAX MUSIC
growing echoey and menacing-

INT BAR - NIGHT - FLASHBACK

The shaky perspective and over-saturated colors again tight
on the men struggling the Girl cowering then Young Tyrone
twisting the Guitar Mans wrist and thrusting again and
again hugging close to him then pulled away and the-

-KNIFE falls to the floor BLOODY and the-

-Guitar Man falls to his hands and knees his stomach a
bloody mess crawling on all fours and HOWLING and Young
Tyrone watching in horror as he is held back by many arms and
the Girl SCREAMING-

INT HONEYDRIPPER - NIGHT - (PRESENT)

-which becomes Time BLOWING HIS SAX into the microphone-
-and Dex reaches for his pistol-

-and Ham reaches for his knife but-

-a huge strong hand clamps down on Dexs wrist-
-and another huge hand grabs Hams wrist

Ty is there clamping onto them with a grip of iron

A lighter bouncier ELECTRIC GUITAR RIFF has replaced the sax
now Ty looks deep into the eyes of the two surprised
pickers-

Ty gently takes the pistol from Dex regards it grimly before
laying it in the box He turns his attention to Ham-

TY

He takes the knife from Ham tosses it in the box-

TY
Yall still need to mess with each
other you go outside and do it

Ty lets go of their wrists-

TY
This world is full of people got no

The two give each other a final dirty look and move away into
opposite corners-

STAGE
Sonny keeps playing-

SONNY

Bertha Maes fresh-dug GRAVE He listens to the MUSIC in the
far distance-

SLICK

He listens for another moment sighs-

SLICK

FADE TO BLACK

77 EXT HONEYDRIPPER - MORNING 77

The SUN RISES next to the Honeydripper sign We hear the
CROW of a distant ROOSTER The parking lot is empty but for
Tys old Ford-

Ty exhausted but happy steps out front He pastes a SNIPE
that says HELD OVER across the Guitar Sam poster-

POSSUM (0OS)
That boy can play some

Ty turns Possum is on the road guitar strung over his
shoulder feeling his way with a red-tipped CANE

TY
You leavin

POSSUM
Aint needed round here no more

TY
Where you headed

POSSUM
(smiles) Oh-- down the road

Ty watches the blind man move away for a moment

MACEO (0S)
Tyrone-

Ty turns as Maceo steps out equally tired and unshaven-

MACEO
Who you talkin to out here
Maceo looks down the road but Possum is nowhere to be seen

Ty shrugs-
TY
Just myself
78 EXT SHARECROPPER SHACK - EARLY MORNING 78

Scratch and Lonnie are set to pretend to play music again
Lonnie spreads his fingers over the keys hes drawn on the
board-

-and begins to PLAY Fast rhythmic boogie piano-

Instead of a Diddley bow Scratch is pretending to tune the
two strings on a ‘guitar made of a plank of wood and baling
wire He carefully takes a length of clothesline rope
leading from the guitar tacks the end of it to the wall of
the shack plugging himself in He looks to Lonnie who
nods and then-

-he begins to PLAY in time with Lonnie

We CRANE UP and away from them the MUSIC spilling out over
the field-

It sounds a whole lot like rock and roll

THE END
