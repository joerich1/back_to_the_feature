INT LECTURE HALL BERKELEY - DAY

The hall is full On the stage DR HELEN HUDSON is
speaking HELEN is a forensic psychologist Behind her is
a projected diagram PREDISPOSITION DISSOCIATION TRAUMA
FANTASY VIOLENT FANTASY FACILITATORS MURDER and
TRAUMA-REINFORCEMENT which she can point to with a laser
pointing device We see her from a considerable

distance the back of the balcony Her voice is crisp and
assured

HELEN
Our society creates these socially
and psychically disenfranchised
men and their revenge on society
is terrible They are hard to
catch They are the nice guy next
door their employers -- if they
work at all -- find them quiet and
uncomplaining Early abuse and
rejection have taught them
passivity Only in their violent
fantasies do they feel alive What
they seek in their frenzied
assaults on their victims is relief
from passivity For these men ten
minutes relief is worth far more
than the life of another human
being Torture the pain they
inflict the screams of the victim
are all part of the ritual that
gives them a brief respite from
their own psychic pain And then
the depression the forgetting the
feeling of sadness and despair
begins the cycle all over again
Like addicts seeking their drug
Albert DeSalvo Bianchi and Buono
Berkowitz Dahmer Bundy -- they
seek out their next victim

During the second half of this speech the eye of the camera
has moved slowly forward until it settles just behind the
balcony railing

CLOSEUP HELEN

HELEN
The cycle is endless until they are
caught And they are caught by
chance -- they run a red light and
a body is in the trunk A leaking
pipe brings a plumber to a basement
where they is the smell of death

Her eyes have come to rest on the spot of the camera eye in
the balcony Her voice chokes off She stares

HELENS POV

Sitting in the front row of the balcony a YOUNG RED-HEADED
MAN (DARYLL LEE CULLUM) leans forward resting his tattooed
arms on the railing He smiles intimately at HELEN

HELEN cuts her eyes to the left She sees

Backstage an overweight COP in plain clothes Instantly
alert to HELENS alarm he jumps up comes within an inch of
exposing his presence to the audience A SECOND COP in the
wings on the other side of the stage also springs to
attention FIRST COPS eyes follow HELENS

Their POV THE BALCONY - YOUNG RED-HEADED MAN is no longer
there

HELEN Can she believe her eyes Resumes

HELEN
At any time right now as you
listen the FBI estimates there are
30 to 35 serial killers stalking
their victims The serial killer is
a plaque that must be addressed not
only by the law but by science
Florida spent eight million dollars
to execute Ted Bundy It would
have been better spent building a
forensic penal facility devoted to
research

Once again her eyes fix on the balcony to reassure herself
that the smiling man is not there

HELEN
Confined for life without parole
and subjected to scientific study
these mens lives might finally in
some small measure educate and
thereby protect society Thank
you

Applause as Helen warily checks for the TWO COPS They are
carefully casing the crowd

CUT TO
LATER

The crowd is breaking up FIRST COP walks HELEN to the
ladies room People reach to shake Helens hand she copes
as well as she can with her fear THEY LEAVE THE STAGE
THROUGH A DOOR OPENING TO A CORRIDOR LEADING BACK TO
DRESSING ROOMS AND A LADIES ROOM

CUT TO
INT LADIES ROOM - DAY

THE COP clearly embarrassed pokes his head in and looks
around Under one stall he sees a womans HIGH HEELS He
hastily ducks back into HALL and signals an okay to Helen
Before the door behind her closes we see the COP prepare to
stand guard outside HELEN walks past the stall with the
high heels to a stall several doors down

CLOSE UP HIGH HEELS

And a tattoo that the cop missed seeing on one of the
ankles The shoes are kicked off The feet disappear from
view as

HELEN a few stalls away methodically places toilet paper
around the seat before raising her skirt A faint noise
makes her freeze Her hand reaches for the door She is
just able to unlock it but no more before a NOISE COMES
DOWN FROM THE NEXT STALL

Like a lariat it falls over HELENS head and is violently
yanked tight She kicks at the stall door

CORRIDOR COP leaning against outside door smoking hears
the clang of metal as the stall door bangs open He
reacts
INT LADIES ROOM -

The RED-HEADED MAN is struggling to secure the rope around a
hook inside his own stall KNOCKING (os)

COP (os)
Doctor Hudson Are you okay in
there

The MAN lets slip a little slack

HELENS fingers thrusting between the rope and her neck
get just enough air for HELEN to let out a strangled little
scream

CORRIDOR COP not certain what to do about the ambiguous
sounds from inside Women stands nearby inhibiting him for
a split second from going in the Ladies Room door Now
there is more SOUND from inside

INT LADIES ROOM - CONTINUOUS

COP steps into the room gun down Over the COPS shoulder
we see HELEN hanging in open booth her hand fluttering at
her throat She has one slippery shoeless foot on the
toilet seat

COP takes a couple of steps forward Behind COPS back we
see a broom closet door opening

HELENS POV CLOSE UP The COP taken from behind Ina
second his throat is slit In a gush of blood he falls
his gun still in his hand

RED-HEADED MAN standing over the fallen COP smiling at
HELEN

COPS BODY IS TWITCHING JERKING The violent contractions
in his fingers cause the gun to go off ONE TWO SHOTS
the sound reverberating against the tile walls

STAGE AREA

The audience and SECOND COP react to the gunshots
HELEN her eyes bulging struggling against the rope

SLAM CUT
INT HELENS APT - SAN FRANCISCO - NIGHT

As HELEN in bed bolts up from the nightmare her hands try
desperately to pull the dream rope from her neck She is now
pale her hair is dirty there are deep circles under her
eyes This is a woman in the throes of a breakdown

HELEN
Andy Andy
She races through this LOFT APARTMENT (THE WALLS ARE EIGHT
FEET UNDER A TWELVE-FOOT CEILING) to study opening off a
hall She looks in gasping for breathing

INT STUDY - CONTINUOUS

The room is neat -- nobody there (We will later see that it
is used on and off by her computer Andy)

HELEN whimpers in frustration she is alone SHE TALKS TO
HERSELF as she turns back and moves past a LIVING ROOM
where she turns on lights and the TV flicks on (COURT TV)
The sound comes up loud She moves on trying to calm
herself with the sound of her own voice

HELEN
It is October twelfth 1994 in the
city of San Francisco California
USA the strongest richest
most stable and happiest country in
the world That is the sole place
of life in the universe Under
God

CLOSE XANAX BOTTLE Two pills are shaken out into a palm
others scattering from the nervous haste

CLOSE HELEN Watching herself in BATHROOM mirror as she
tosses down the pills gulps water She regards her haggard
reflection with a certain detachment

HELEN
Good God What happened to you

She barks a rueful laugh we are seeing a woman will
herself from near-hysteria to relative calm

CUT TO

HALL As she exits the bathroom And moves into her OFFICE
She pours herself a brandy and stands before two computers
Of the side-by-side computer screens one is blank The
other shows a chess setup Flashing on the bottom of the
screen comes a command

CHESSMASTER
Its almost seven Make a goddam
move

She studies the chess set-up for a moment then makes a
move She has not even hit the Keyboard of the other
computer before CHESSMASTER sends another message

CHESSMASTER
Lousy move Not really into this
game Helen Lets drop it Ive
got a feeling about you Lets
meet Like a date

HELEN types the following to CHESSMASTER

HELEN
‘Im a terrible date Id mess up your
life

CHESSMASTER
Another romantic dream gone all to
hell

HELEN

Maybe its better to just dream
on avoid the disappointments of
life Come on move

She pushes a button on the remote and we see the window
curtains open BRIGHT SUNLIGHT STREAMS IN We see that the
T-shirt HELEN wears says Shrinks R Us She crosses to
the window with her glass of cognac looks out

VIEW

A sweeping view of the bay and across to Marin County The
morning sun is dispelling the last of the nights fog

HELEN opens window puts a hand outside trying to feel the
air the freedom Feeling quite restored from the dream
horror of the night

OS THE PHONE RINGS HELEN A FRISSON

CLOSE PHONE Her hand comes into FRAME and picks up the
handset and carries CAMERA TO CLOSEUP HELEN

HELEN
(carefully)
Yes
(listens)
You son-of-a-bitch Son of
a bitch

Stiff with fear and rage she slams down phone

HELEN
You filthy son of a bitch

On the computer screen behind her the Chessmaster makes his
move the computer speaks in its tiny computer voice

COMPUTER
(filter)
You Queen is in check
Protect your Queen

young woman She is neat buttoned down crisp MJ
appears to be about twenty-five She is in fact
thirty-four and a homicide inspector with the rank of
sergeant She is usually dressed in slacks and a loose
sweater or an oversize jacket that helps make her appear
even smaller and younger than she is

RUBEN GOETZ is also in homicide about twenty-six and junior
in authority to MJ RUBEN is good-looking good-humored
and laid back He has a cellular phone attached to his
belt

MJ PULLS THE LINE THAT DOLLIES THE TARGET BACK TO THEM

to shooting position

RUBEN

CLOSE AN ATTORNEY IN COURT

ATTORNEY
it was your feeling after
careful evaluation that he was a
sexual sadist who satisfied at
least four out of ten criteria in
the DMS III

SHOW MJ and Ruben watching videotapes and eating Chinese
takeout HELEN is being interrogated by the ATTORNEY for
Daryll Lee Cullum Helen sure of herself to the point of
arrogance which is her undoing

HELEN
Yes Without question

ATTORNEY
Without question He only scored
40 percent four out of ten
criteria Couldnt another expert
say he flunked the sexual sadist
test What curve are you marking
on Doctor
HELEN
The test criteria are only part of
what we look at in evaluating
subjects

ATTORNEY
Only part What else What did
you think of his claim that he tied
this girl to the tree and set fire
to her because Joan of Arc told him

to do it

HELEN
He was lying

ATTORNEY
Lying He was lying I asked
you what you thought not what he
did

HELEN

I thought he was lying

ATTORNEY
You said first he was lying How
do you know that Doctor

HELEN

Because people who are suffering
from aural hallucinations hear
voices in both ears Daryll Lee
told me that Joan of Arc always
appeared beside him on his left
side and spoke softly in his left
ear

Murmur of subdued laughter in court

HELEN

(emboldened)
He took pains to hide his actions
because he knew they were morally
wrong He was not acting on mad
impulse He was sane and acting
out a pattern he carefully followed
every time

ATTORNEY
(playing causal)
What pattern was that

HELEN
The same as the first time

She catches herself The DA has leapt to his feet but now
tries to sit down as though nothing was happening but
Helen the Attorney and the DA all are clearly disturbed
by the line this questioning is taking

ATTORNEY

The first what

(as she hesitates)
Your Honor shes got this far I
think she should finish I dont
think this jury should be left
wondering where the rest of her
statement would lead

JUDGE
I agree Doctor

HELEN
The first two murders

ATTORNEY
What first two murders We dont
know about them here do we

HELEN
(giving up)
He told me he had done two others
just like it

ATTORNEY
When was that

HELEN
When he was seventeen

ATTORNEY
And you believed him when he told
you he had done that

HELEN
Yes I believed him

The DA is rushing to the bench to argue with the Judge

JUDGE (VO)
Yes Ill accept a call fora
mistrial Evidence of that other
crime when the defendant was a
juvenile is inadmissible and never
should have been heard by this
jury

and method will hold back the
horrors of a world gone mad and the
sickness of the night I did once
But you know how hell get caught
Hell have an accident or some cop
will get lucky You cant catch
him by being intelligent and
working hard Or the worst there
are dozens of women slaughtered in
the most horrible way month after
month The news stories grow more
grotesque and bizarre and in the
city people lock their doors and
windows and hurry home before
dark And then one day there are
no more What happened Did he
just stop Get tired and disgusted
and decide not to kill any more
Did he kill himself Did he die in
an auto accident Or a fight Or

get sick and die Its like the
murderer walked off the edge of the
earth And you never know But

you keep asking yourself -- when you
read about a new murder -- is he
back

MJ stands She has noted Rubens reaction to Helens

CUT TO
INT HELENS FRONT DOOR - NIGHT

RUBEN is outside the door HELEN just inside
RUBEN
Theyll have a guard here tomorrow
I know you have the idea but itll
make me feel a lot better

She smiles and RUBEN turns walks away She stays in the
doorway watching his retreat About ten feet away he
suddenly stops

RUBEN
Hey

He turns around she is still in the doorway He reaches
for his wallet withdraws a card holds it up to her

RUBEN
The number for my cellular

RUBEN
Dont hesitate Anytime Night or
day I mean that

He hods card out to her HELEN holding onto the door
frame doesnt move RUBEN continues to extend his hand
with the card in it It is a charged moment She is frozen
in the doorway RUBEN refuses to make a move towards her
HELEN summons all her nerve and lets go of the door frame
determined not to have any further mortification this night
she takes one shaky step out into the hallway to meet him
Then a second step and a third

Her hand touches the card takes it

She turns her head to gauge the distance she must retreat
What she sees is that the doors Sureclose device has
quietly and efficiently closed The door is locked
Frantic she turns back toward RUBEN

HER POV

RUBEN now seems a vast distance away from her He is just
turning down the stairs and is gone The hallway first
narrows squeezing her in then expands She is lost in the

miles and miles of space between the two walls

HELEN
Oh God Help me

RUBEN reappears races toward her

RUBEN
Tell me what to do

HELEN
Im falling Im going to fall
She starts to pass out to sink to her knees but RUBEN
catches her puts her up against the wall handling her like
a suspect He puts one hand on the back of her neck
spreads her legs gets her in frisk position Somehow this
is comforting to her but she is still in full-blown
panic

HELEN
falling FALLING

He pressed his body up against hers his weight anchoring
her against the feeling of free-fall

RUBEN
Im right here I wont let you
fall

He still has a hand on the back of her neck Suddenly the
proximity effects him makes him want to kiss her neck She
begins to hyperventilate

HELEN
Dont let go I cant breathe
Ill die

RUBEN

Shhh Its okay Just breathe
Ill fix it

RUBEN takes out his gun

RUBEN
Put your hands over your ears

RUBEN shoots off the lock Then he picks HELEN up and
carries her back into her apartment

INT HELENS LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

RUBEN enters and puts HELEN down on the couch pulls a throw
up over her He sees her Xanax bottle on a table hands it
to her She takes out three as he pours her some seltzer
water then watches her take the pills After which he
takes the bottle and pockets it

HELEN

CROSS FADE TO
INT BEDROOM (DALY CITY) - NIGHT

Dim light The room is unattractive over-furnished but not
comfortably A WOMAN is sitting propped up in a double bed
She is in her mid-thirties but drained and pale she looks
older A chronic invalid By her side is a NASTY LITTLE
DOG with ribbon bows in its fur Near the bed is a TV and
video on which a movies final credits are running

THE WOMAN IS IMPATIENTLY PUSHING AN INTERCOM BUTTON

PETER enters Younger than the woman rather good-looking
Boyish and nondescript except for a patch of white skin near
his hairline AN OLD SCAR He goes straight to TV and puts
the tape on eject

WOMAN

PETER

WOMAN

He inserts the video she wants and pushes play Then he
approaches the bed leans over his wife and gently pushes a
lock of hair back from the forehead

She ignores him staring at the screen The NASTY LITTLE
DOG BARES ITS TEETH AND SNAPS AT HIM

WOMAN

See now youve annoyed her You

He leaves As he goes we can hear the Woman still talking
to her dog over the TV soundtrack

WOMAN (contd)
You wouldnt lie to Mummy would

Such a naughty widdle dog

HER VOICE FADES AWAY AS WE FOLLOW HIM down the stairs into a
small ill-lit and dreary living room into a messy kitchen
then through a door leading to the basement He locks the
basement door behind him

THE BASEMENT is brightly lighted full of high tech gadgets
and computers As he approaches the bottom stair we see a
small TVvideo set attached to a wall On its screen
freeze-framed and silent is a video of a PRETTY GIRL at an
outdoor rock concert smiling seductively

PETER puts on a WHITE LAB COAT and then reaches over
something to turn the video back on

The CAMERA PANS DOWN to what he has leaned across It is
the YOUNG GIRL from the concert She is strapped onto a
table her mouth taped shut A plastic bag covers her head
but not tightly She is semiconscious She is being
asphyxiated by slow degrees

PETER looks at her gently pushes the bag up far enough to
repeat the tender gesture with her damp hair that he made
toward his wife He whispers
PETER
Didnt I promise Id come right
back

glorious misty green hills hand in hand The Camera moves
down across verdant meadows until we arrive at the bottom
of the nearest hill which slopes finally to a highway A
few festival up-all-night REVELERS looking down at a new
CRIME SCENE where three blue-and-whites are parked plus a
number of unmarked cars

RUBEN ARRIVES IN A TAXI

As he moves past the ever-present SUSAN we THREAD THROUGH

stubble his yesterdays slept-in clothes and she turns
away Before RUBEN can catch up with her NIKKO approaches

NIKKOS face is tight with anger

NIKKO

RUBEN

He moves to MJ who stands beside the dead BODY OF THE
WOMAN WE LAST SAW STRAPPED TO A TABLE The plastic bag is
now tied tight around her neck She has been posed beneath
a sign that says NO DUMPING The usual technicians
photographers Doc the Coroner etc

RUBEN

MJ is kneeling inspecting everything here Ruben kneels
beside her to Ruben

Down below Susan and the Haircut are interviewing Festival-

Nikko trots off to Susan and the Haircut MJ gestures for
RUBEN now on his feet and dabbing at a split lip to follow
her back to the cars As they move more slowly down the
hillside to their cars

MJ

Ruben jumps in on the other

From outside the car as they drive away we see Rubens arm
clap the magnetic flasher on the top of their unmarked car

MJ switches it on A CHASE ENSUES

SUSAN has a faster

car but MJ is a better driver Stomach dropping hills
trolley cars the corkscrew turns of Lombard Street all the

familiar San Francisco chase scenes

MJ

wind up with a harassment charge
Anything Youre like some horny
little teenager

MJ takes another two-wheel corner In the rear view
mirror MJ watches SUSAN lose control of her car as she
tries to make a tight turn MJ smiles in contempt

MJ
Anybody whos ever watched TV knows
about that corner
Having lost SUSAN MJ slows down to a normal speed
MJ
Everybody could see you -- unshaved
same clothes from yesterday

reeking of sex

RUBENS eye-brows lift She peels into the HQ parking lot
and jumps out

MJ
(going away)
Park the car Call the lab Get
Doc to lean on the coroner for a

her

RUBEN

He pulls her down into a chair with him his arms tight
around her holding her still He smoothes her hair rubs

RUBEN
When I was a little kid and Id be
in a state my father would hold me
on his lap until all the fight
would go out of me

She breaks free and whacks him across his nose

HELEN
You think youre my Daddy

There is something so perverse about this so erotic that
RUBEN kisses her She goes limp kisses him back then
shes suddenly sobbing His nose is bleeding but shes
smiling Something between them has finally connected
Been agreed upon

RUBEN

He digs out his sneaky gun from whenever he keeps it

RUBEN

A SONG BEGINS PRELAPPING THE FOLLOWING SCENES MURDER BY
NUMBERS BY THE POLICE

Once that youve decided on a killing

First you make a stone of your heart

And if you find that your hands are still willing
You can turn murder into an art

IT WELL AND EMPTIES OUT THE BULLETS SHE LOCKS IT UP AND
HEAVES A SIGH OF RELIEF

THE SONG CONTINUES

THE FBI ARRIVES High angle looking down three identical
cars draw in front park with military precision all four
doors on the all three cars open at the same time and
identically dressed men in suits get out slam the doors
in sync and march toward the front steps to HQ ignoring a
couple of bemused cops smoking on the sidewalk

INT POLICE HQ - CONTINUOUS

As the parade of FBI led by their Commander SAKS walk down
the corridor from the front door toward CAMERA performing
a smart right angle turn and (CAMERA PANNING TO FOLLOW)
continue away from CAMERA down another corridor Through
the glass partitions and in the halls they pass cops who
pretend they arent looking at them no eye contact between
cops and FBI The cops are at ease bellies slop over
belts neatly pressed blouses strain over breasts sweat
stains shirtsleeves The marching men wouldnt sweat

QUINN emerges from his office and sees them arriving He
gets his jacket off a hook on the back of the door signals
a few top officers to follow He looks resigned

INT TASK FORCE ROOM - DAY (LATER)

MJ RUBEN NIKKO and a number of other officers are being
addressed by SAKS an FBI agent At the back are three more
FBI AGENTS suited and tied QUINN stands off to one side
THE SONG IS JUST ENDING ON A CD PLAYER IN THE ROOM A
projector beams up a copy of the note RUBEN found in the
phone booth

Dr Hudson Dont lose your head

Once that youve decided on a killing

First you make a stone of your heart

And if you find that your hands are still willing
You can turn murder into an art

Well if you have a taste for this experience
Youre flushed with your very first success
Then you must try a twosome or a threesome
Before your conscience bothers you much less
Then you can join the ranks of the illustrious
In historys great dark hall of fame

All of our greatest killers were industrious
At least the ones that we all know by name

SAKS speaks

SAKS
Hello I am (research title)
Meryhew Saks The song is called
Murder By Numbers The
performers are a group called The
Police Adam here
from Behavioral Science is
working out exactly what this
perpetrator is trying to telegraph
in the note This is an extremely
complex case and we have a lot of
fancy theories floating around
Were not ruling out the possib-
ility of three Copycat serial
killers We have Quantico working
on graphology the Washington lap
is cloning DNA from the secretor
Its our feeling that the best lead
we have is the two sperm samples in
one of the victims We have a team
sweeping sperm banks Now I want
to say a few word to you local
people Your Commissioner asked
for our assistance The Bureau
does not send us in on these cases
to lord it over the local police
We couldnt catch up on what you
people know if we had a year We
have nation-wide resources and hard
state of the art forensic science
you have the local savvy Together
we can be unbeatable Which one is
Inspector Halloran

MJ
Over here

SAKS approaches MJ guides her away from the others
TWO SHOT Saks is unctuous and insincere self-confident

SAKS
We dont see too many lady homicide
detectives You have my respect
Have you discussed the note with
Dr Hudson

MJ
Someone broke into her place last
night It wasnt connected to our
case but it shook her up pretty
bad so I havent

QUINN joins them SAKS gives him a nod

SAKS
I was just about to advise the
Inspector here not to show Dr
Hudson the note

MJ
Sir Doctor Hudson and I see a

pattern develop

SAKS
(riding over her)
We know Helen Shes not exactly a
credible collaborator Especially
late in the day

MJ
She takes tranquilizers her doctor
prescribes

SAKS

Who prescribes the brandy

MJS look makes SAKS smile QUINN is called to the phone

MJ
How come youre so up on Dr
Hudson

SAKS

She is a writer writing best
selling books about serial killing
Giving lectures shes well-paid
for Her interests are not the
interests of law enforcement

MJ
Okay

SAKS
Weve put a tap on Dr Hudsons
phone I know you wont mention
it

So much for any trusting relationship right QUINN has
arrived addresses SAKS

QUINN
Sorry to interrupt I need a word
with my officer

He turns to MJ Diplomatically SAKS moves away

QUINN
MJ Im going to have to borrow
Ruben The alien-smuggling thing
in Chinatown is going down tomorrow
night and Jacks kid got hit by a
car I gotta give Ruben to Nikko

MJ
What does this mean Now we got
the FBI my team is expendable
Im working my ass off is anybody
listening Why Ruben anyway He
and Nikko dont even get on
together
QUINN
Teach both of them a lesson in
cooperation and self-discipline

MJ
If this is a first step in kicking
me off the case just tell me to
my face sir dont waste time
being diplomatic

QUINN
Just I need results And -- I am
short-handed Who else am I gonna
give him

MJ
(looking at Saks)
Give him thatpompous son of a
bitch

She turns and leaves brushing past Saks as she goes Gigi
meets her

GIGI
Lab called They got a result on
the drug test you requested

It takes a moment to remember what it was

GIGI
They said it was Windex

If there was any residual doubt about whats happening its
gone now She starts after Quinn sees he is in spirited
dialogue with SAKS and decides to wait

HELEN

They put Merry Saks on it

MJ
He said to send you his regards and
to tell you that the Bureau holds
you in the highest esteem

HELEN

What I cant believe is that in an
earlier life I slept with him
Christ Any God that loved his
people would give women a rewind on
their life and an erase button

(looks at MJ)
Just give me a minute here The
letter is addressed to me

(shes breathing

fast controls it)
You dont feel fear do you
Youre young You feel like youll
live forever How wonderful

MJ
I put my ass on the line giving
you that

HELEN
They werent going to show it to
me The arrogance Its my life

MJ
Its also the major piece of
evidence and it makes you a key
part of his plan You cant run
away from it anymore

(beat)

Look at the order hes doing
He did three as the Boston
Strangler just to tell us a copycat
serial killer was at work Then he
did one like the Hillside Strang-
ler And then one as Son of Sam
To lead us on -- to where and what
end And hes doing more than that
-- hes imitating each killers
method as closely as he can -- in
details Injecting Windex Using
-44 Playing Abba

HELEN
Its not chronological Son of Sam
was before Hillside

She begins to read

MJ
Its clear he thinks he knows me
He lives a fantasy Helen dont
lose your head Is that a threat
Does he want to cut off my head
Dahmer cut off heads Who else
Kemper Did Gacy Rivkind I
think Rivkind did

She puts the note down on the table smoothes it out She
closes her eyes for a moment We begin to see certain
filtered images As they come we INTERCUT them

have What he feels excluded
from

EXT UNIVERSITY CAMPUS - DAY

Lush pastoral green We see PETER sitting by himself He
wears a WHITE LAB COAT like one we saw hanging in his

HIS POV of students on the green playing Frisbee
studying together picnicking Women sunbathe their straps
pulled down on their shoulders their tops rolled up to
expose their midriffs

HELEN (VO)
First you make a stone of your

heart Oh yes He doesnt
suffer Thats past Now its our
turn

One of the sunbathing girls sits up and looks round then
takes her top off entirely

HELEN (VO)
Kemper said in order to have the
experience he wanted with them he
needed to evict them from their
bodies By making the body a
completely passive object he
releases himself from passivity

CLOSE HELEN DEEP IN THOUGHT

HELEN

But the relief he feels is only
temporary Before your
conscience bothers you much
less But the tension always
comes back

(she now picks out

the words)
You can join the ranks of the
illustrious He wants to be
like them The best To become

the best But he has his own
desires his own compulsions apart
from theirs His own horrors

MOTHER grabs him by the hair and drags him with her

Some horrors that are all his
own

The SMALL BOY is flung into an under-stairs closet where
firewood and stacked papers are kept The door is slammed
hard He gropes around in the darkness finds a big box of
matches lights one Then angrily he sets fire to a pile
of newspapers They start to burn We see but do not
hear his screams for help

HELEN (VO)
He needs to prove they dont
control him that hes the one in
control But the feeling of power
never lasts He can control his
victims but he cant control
anything else his place in the
world He want s to be recognized
He puts messages in my computer he
sends me a letter

INT HELENS APARTMENT - DAY

She picks out the lines then you must try a twosome or a
threesome

EXT HER BUILDING - NIGHT
The door opens and Helen appears in it She confronts the
street and the night One more threshold to cross

STREET HER OLD SAAB IS PARKED THE ANTENNA IS GONE AND
ITS COVERED WITH CITY GRIME The night seems to roar the
lights blur and flare A truck comes past too fast
stirring up dust and buffeting her with wind

HELEN steeling herself and running the few steps to her car

INT CAR as she slides into the drivers seat slamming the
door and locking it She drives off into the night

EXT MULUSKEY AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

A broad view through shadowy trees shows its lighted
facade Parked in front of is MJs car SUDDENLY FROM
BEHIND THE TREES SAKS STEPS OUT IN FRONT BLOCKING THE WAY

NEW ANGLE Helens Saab speeds out of the tree shadowed
street into the bright plaza in front of the auditorium and
brakes behind MJs car

CLOSE HELEN Sudden silence when she kills the car engine
She gets out of the car As she walks even her sneakers
make an echo from the silent stone facade She walks up
the wide stairs

INT AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

The huge doors creak open and Helen enters She stands
listening light streams in from the exterior through tall
windows otherwise its all back shadows weird enough
without the distorted vision the vertigo that momentarily
returns

Helen wills herself to move into the deep space before her
She stands listening we HEAR the creaks and tiny snaps of a
building cooling in the night air Or is the movement of
Peter somewhere in the room

She whirls to face a distance sound that echoes in the
auditorium

CLOSE HELEN staring trying to SEE NOTHING
THEN

PETER IS STARING BACK HIS FACE BECOMES DARYLL LEE THE
VISION SNAPS

HELEN SHE TURNS AND WALKS PAST THE ROSTRUM OF THE STAGE TO
A DOOR UPSTAGE LEFT OPENING INTO A LONG AND DARK
CORRIDOR SHE GROPES FOR LIGHT SWITCHES CANT FIND OUT ANY
THE CORRIDOR LEADS TO THE LADIES ROOM ON THE RIGHT AS SHE
WALKS DOWN THE HALLWAY IT BEGINS TO RESEMBLE TO HER THE
SAME WALK SHE TOOK AT THE BEGINNING AND SUDDENLY AT THE
DOOR TO THE LADIES ROOM SHE SEEMS TO SEE THE FAT COP SHE
SHAKES HER HEAD AND THE VISION IS GONE

REPLACED BY INT LADIES ROOM THE COP IS NOW HELD FROM
BEHIND BY DARYLL LEE - SMILING AT HELEN IN REVERSE WE SEE
FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT HELEN HAS THE ROPE WELL AWAY FROM
HER NECK WE REALIZE SHE HAS AMPLE TIME TO WARN THE COP
BUT SHE IS PARALYZED FASCINATED BY WHAT IS HAPPENING IN
TERRIBLE SLOW MOTION INTERCUTS BETWEEN DARYLL LEE GRINNING
AT HER HELENS HELPLESS HORROR THE COPS APPEALING LOOK TO
HER AND BACK TO DARYLL LEE AS (BELOW THE FRAME) HE SLITS THE
COPS THROAT AND LETS HIM FALL TO THE FLOOR

HELEN (FLASHBACK) AT LAST BEGINS TO SCREAM

ALL) SHE PULLS RUBENS GUN FROM HER POCKET AND SHOVES OPEN
THE DOOR INTO THE LADIES ROOM

Men begin moving cautiously out of the trees and shadows
toward the Auditorium

INT LADIES ROOM

HELEN MOVES ALONG THE STALLS PUSHING DOORS OPEN UNTIL SHE
SHOVES ONE OPEN AND SEES

MJ IS HANGING BY A NOOSE DANGLING THE SAME WAY HELEN DID
IN THE OPENING SEQUENCE SHE IS ALIVE HOLDING THE NOOSE
FROM HER NECK BY ONE HAND

HELEN STARTS TO RUSH TO HER ASSISTANCE WHEN THE LIGHTS GO
OUT PETER TAKES HER FROM BEHIND SWIFTLY DISARMING HER
REGARDING THE GUN WITH AMAZEMENT

PETER
You cheated You said youd come
die with me

WITHOUT PAUSE HE PUMPS TWO BULLETS INTO MJ WHERE SHE
HANGS HER BODY JUMPS FROM THE IMPACT OF THE BULLETS HER
HEAD FLIES BACK AND SHE SLUMPS THE NOOSE TIGHTENS THE DOOR
OF THE STALL SWINGS SLOWLY SHUT AS PETER TURNS ON HELEN
WHERE SHE LIES ON THE FLOOR HORROR-STRUCK

EXT AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

WITH EFFICIENCY AND CAUTION FBI SWAT TYPES MOVE TOWARD THE
AUDITORIUM A GRAPPLING HOOK IS THROWN HIGH OVER THE ROOF
THEY PREPARE FOR AN ASSAULT A HELICOPTER SWOOPS IN BATHING
THE SCENE IN ITS BRILLIANT LIGHT
INT AUDITORIUM STAGE - NIGHT

PETER HAS HELEN ON THE STAGE WHERE CHAIRS ARE RANDOMLY
SCATTERED AND PUSHED HER TO A SEAT FACING HIM ALMOST KNEE

TO KNEE HELEN WILL USE HER PSYCHOLOGICAL WILES TO TRY TO
TAKE AWAY PETERS CONTROL OF THE SITUATION PETER LOOKS UP
AT THE SOUND HE IS PROUD AND THRILLED

PETER

Listen to them Well be on all
three channels

HELEN
Kill me Peter do it now

PETER
No Not yet

HELEN
Do it If thats what all this
carnage is about then do it Have

enough guts to do it

PETER
Dont talk to me about courage I
know death what its like to kill
Youre not a killer -- you watched
Daryll Lee kill that cop and you
didnt make a peep because you

were paralyzed with fear You
chocked I know something else about
you

Peter is jerking about with amphetamine energy he pops a
pill into his mouth and swallows

PETER

You want one No There was

something in you that was

fascinated that wanted to see what
it was like for a man to die

Everybody feels it Like every

person who slows to see a bad

accident or runs to see a fire

Thats true I see it in you

youre the same as me

THERE IS NOISE OUTSIDE LIKE SOMEONE BREAKING IN

PETER
Oh no

HE GRABS HER AND SHE MOVES WITH HIM WITHOUT RESISTANCE AS
HE TURNS OUT THE LIGHTS INSIDE

FLOODLIGHTS SUDDENLY ILLUMINATE THE FACADE OUTSIDE
INCREASING THE BRILLIANCE OF THE LIGHT STREAMING IN AND
DARKENING THE SHADOWS FURTHER GERMAN EXPRESSIONISM

He leads her back to the stage he pushes her into a chair
facing him He looks into her face and smiles
PETER

Well keep talking Until they get
here Then
(smiles)

HELEN
I have no life anymore I ruined
your life make me pay for it

PETER
Why did you do that Didnt you
have any idea how hard it was for
me to get that far I worshipped
you You inspired me I thought
you could understand me the way you
understood the others I knew that
about you -- the ones you admired
were the great murderers they
fascinated you

HELEN
Thats not who I admire -- I admire
people who are good at what they
do great artists writers
thinkers

PETER
I dont have the talent for any of
those things All I have a talent
for is death And I am one of a
kind What do you think of your
student now I have made you
famous I am your creation and your
monument

BEHIND HIM A SHADOWY FIGURE DARTS FROM HIDING SPOT TO A
VANTAGE POINT WE CANT MAKE OUT THE FIGURE HELEN SEES
BUT PETER DOES NOT

HELEN
If you let me I can make you more
famous than any of them

PETER
Oh please I know whats coming

HELEN

Do anything you want to me I give
myself to you Only put the knife
down Isnt this what you always
wanted I know its what we all
want to love and to loved I
could love you You could work
together in some safe place learn
to really understand you help you

happiness

PETER
Back in the drivers seat again
Doctor That old dream -- study us
to see what makes us sick So you
can find a cure -- theyd name it
after you Death is the only cure
for people like me

He leans toward her with the knife This might be the
moment His gun lies on the floor beside him

HER EYES HAVE FLICKED TO THE SHADOW BEHIND HIM HE SEES IT
AND STOOPS TO PICK UP THE GUN AND FIRES INTO THE SHADOWS
TWO OR THREE QUICK ROUNDS HE TURNS BACK TO HELEN DROPPING
THE GUN TO REACH FOR THE KNIFE

HELEN HEAD BUTTS HIM WITH ASTONISHING STRENGTH KNOCKING HIM
BACKWARD SHE STANDS HE COMES UP WITH GUN AND AIMS AT
HER

BEHIND HIM MJ STEPS OUT OF THE SHADOWS HAVING NOW A CLEAN
SHOT

HELEN DOESNT GIVE A CLUE JUST LOOKS INTO PETERS EYES AS
MJ AND PETER IN SLOW MOTION DETAILS AS SHE LINES UP HER
SHOT SHE COULD KILL HIM OR GO FOR THE EXPOSED SHOULDER

HELEN
Do it For Gods sake now

MJ FIRES

PETER IS SPUN AWAY FROM HELEN BY THE IMPACT STANDS THERE
SHAKING WITH THE SHOCK OF THE HIT HE STARES AT HER

PETER
(surprised like a
child)
You hurt me

MJ HOLDS HER GUN ON HIM READY TO SHOOT AGAIN BUT HE JUST
GOES DOWN ON ONE KNEE HIS BODY VIOLENTLY SHUDDERING AS

THERE IS A HUGE SOUND OF BREAKING GLASS AND THEN AN ENORMOUS
EXPLOSION THAT THROWS THEM TO THE GROUND

THE BIG FRONT DOORS ARE BLASTED OPEN AND THE FLAK VESTED
SWAT TEAM SWARMS THROUGH SMOKE FROM THE CONCUSSION
GRENADE SWIRLS IN THE CHIAROSCURO OF FLOODLIGHTS AND
SHADOWS
OUT OF THE SMOKE COME SKI-MASKED SWAT MEN

MJ and HELEN

PETER TURNS TO THE SWAT TEAM OFFERING HIMSELF AS THE WOMEN
SCREAM TO THE SWAT MENS WOUNDED AND HARMLESS

A PATTERN OF RED DOTS FROM LASER BEAM SIGHTS ON THE SWAT
TEAM RIFLES DAPPLE PETERS HEAD AND TORSO

SWAT TEAM
LIKE A FIRING SQUAD THE TEAM FIRES

PETERS BODY FLIES THROUGH THE AIR FROM THE IMPACT AND
SLIDES SPRAWLING ACROSS THE STAGE TO A STOP

her shirt wincing at the movement Helen helps her
MJ

Oh God

SAKS AND QUINN EMERGE THROUGH THE CHIAROSCURO OF SMOKE AND
LIGHT AND SHADOW When MJ sees him she takes out her gun
and hands it to him It is what he expects but she
misunderstands -- she is offering it to him as her
resignation from the cops He takes it only as a part of
officer related shooting routine SHE LOOKS INTO HIS FACE
AS HE SMELLS THE MUZZLE KNOWS SHE FIRES IT APPROVED

QUINN
Tll take it kid You take two
weeks paid leave Dont waste a
second thinking about that shitbag

He nods to Helen

Of no importance to him he turns away
INT AUDITORIUM - NIGHT
