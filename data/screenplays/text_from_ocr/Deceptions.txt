EXTERIOR AN LA STREET - NIGHT

A beat-up egg-shell Porsche brakes at a stop light beside an
immaculate red Ferrari

INSIDE THE PORSCHE

is PETE GENTRY Hes give-a-damn good-looking maybe 33
well-built There is something special about Gentry Maybe
its the careless way he holds the wheel Maybe its the
scratched-up leather jacket or the haircut one week past
neat Or maybe its something secret and hidden and waiting
to explode Whatever it is its there in spades

Gentrys vision trails over to the car idling beside him a
red Ferrari Gentry casually takes in the car then the
driver a silk-and-designer-jeans Hollywood type who first
recognizes Gentrys existence with an expression of disdain
then a grin of anticipation Gentry returns his eyes to the
stop light before gently easing the ancient Porsche into
first A race

Moments pass Light still red More moments Green light

The Ferrari roars off the line ahead of the Porsche Gentry

corrects an early fish-tail shifts into second Third The
cars are bumper-and-bumper Fourth Porsche pulling ahead

Fifth The Ferrari is falling behind Shitty driver

The Ferrari brakes and executes a sharp left in shame Still
powering forward Gentry grins

A moment later an LAPD black-and-white pulls in behind him
INT MOVING BLACK-AND-WHITE - NIGHT
Two cops VET and ROOKIE

EXT TRANCAS BEACH - DAY

An hour after sunrise A lonely jogger pounds up the sand
A moment after sand has stopped cascading into his
footprints a woman walks from the sea Her beauty is
arresting and uncalculated ADRIENNE

Nearby a house a cool two million five if its a dime A
huge two-story window fronts the sea and below a deck and
exterior staircase Retrieving a towel from the sand
Adrienne makes for the house

INT ERICKSEN LIVING ROOM - DAY
Adrienne lets herself in via the sliding door The place is

chic and expensive She ascends the steps to the second
floor
Deceptions by Richard Taylor 3

INT ERICKSEN HOUSE BEDROOM - DAY
DOUGLAS ERICKSEN 40 a self-made man whose single pretense

is that he has none tosses a leather suitcase onto the bed
Bare-chested he intends to pack and dress at the same time

Adrienne enters and moves for the bathroom unsnapping and
removing the bikini top as she goes

Douglas pulls on a beige business shirt buttons the front
starts on the cuffs when Adrienne wearing nothing but a
towel bunched in front of her steps into the doorway

ADRIENNE
Douglas

Adrienne smiles alluringly She is the most beautiful
naked juicy woman imaginable But Douglas is a tough guy

DOUGLAS
(reluctantly)
Youll make me late for my plane

ADRIENNE
Then hurry home

Yes He will

EXT ERICKSEN DRIVEWAY - DAY

Douglas places his bags in the trunk of his Mercedes
Adrienne watches nearby He stops at the car door and looks

at her a long moment before

DOUGLAS
Tomorrow

Douglas pulls her into an embrace Gentle he nonetheless
lifts her up to meet him Their lips linger before

ADRIENNE
Tomorrow

Douglas slides behind the wheel and a moment later the
Mercedes backs out of the driveway and motors south

DISSOLVE TO
EXT ERICKSEN HOUSE DECK - NIGHT

Adrienne leans against the rail nursing a drink
Deceptions by Richard Taylor 4

The wash of the sea is an endless noise Up and down Trancas
Beach few house lights are lit She could be the only person
for miles

Finishing the drink Adrienne gives the night one final look
before entering the house

INT ERICKSEN LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Adrienne slides the door closed and locks it
A moment later she checks the front door Its locked too

A moment after that she stops at the staircase long enough
to shut off the television with the remote before tossing it
to the couch and ascending the steps

INT ERICKSEN BEDROOM - NIGHT

Adrienne slips beneath the covers then reaches for the
bedside lamp An instant later her eyes are high-lighted by
moonlight sliced by blinds She closes her eyes An effort

SOME TIME LATER

Adrienne jerks at an almost imperceptible noise from below

She reaches for the bedside lamp then reconsiders Rising

from the bed she grabs a robe pulls it on and then stands
perfectly still listening

Nothing

She is almost ready to dismiss the whole thing when she hears
a noise Distantly From below

Adrienne tip-toes to the door turns the knob slowly pulls
it open It starts to creak She freezes Shit Nudging
it open but a little the door creaks again No escaping the
noise Adrienne gently opens the door wide enough to slip
through

HALLWAY AND STAIRS - ADRIENNE

opens a hallway cabinet withdraws a flashlight but does not
turn it on She stands perfectly still listening Nothing
She tip-toes to the stairs begins to descend

A thud followed by the sound of shattering porcelain
Adrienne freezes and listens but hears nothing Pounding

heart Blood pulsating through her veins Someone could be
down there
Deceptions by Richard Taylor 5

The flashlight beam flits out and down the staircase making
ordinary reality out of the darkness far below A chair leg
The drapes A painting Moments later

ADRIENNE
Is there someone there

Another noise Close Near the bottom of the stairs
Adrienne gasps then whips the heavy flashlight around
swinging it from place to place The shafting beam catches
nothing

Adrienne steels herself and descends
LIVING ROOM - ADRIENNE

reaches floor-level and sweeps the light across the mass of
oblong shapes that briefly become her furniture before again
being swallowed by darkness

She advances to the sliding glass door checks that it is
locked again then turns As she does the flashlight
catches something slashing toward her She jumps back
only to discover that its a shadow created by the flashlight
in her hand Adrienne calms herself -- before a noise
wrenches her around She swings the light

ADRIENNE
Whos there Whos there

Something leaps from the darkness and lands nearby Adrienne
brings the beam to bear on Buttermilk her startled
Siamese cat whose diamond eyes glow in the dark

Sagging Adrienne laughs at her own fright She reaches out
to the animal and it gladly moves into her arms As she pets
the cat

ADRIENNE
Buttermilk Jesus You nearly
scared me to death

Behind Adrienne is a glass wall before the ocean The face
then torso of a man rises from the beach and approaches

Adrienne moves away still petting the cat
ADRIENNE
If you broke any of my china

thats it for you kid

She turns around just as the intruder drops out of sight
Deceptions by Richard Taylor 6

ADRIENNE
(Buttermilk)
Do you hear hmmm Do you hear

Turning again Adrienne cannot see the intruder approach the
glass His face looks gruesome as if melted in a fire
Then it becomes clear Hes wearing a stocking

Adrienne cuddles Buttermilk to her cheek lovingly She dotes
on this animal

At the window now the intruders face presses against the
glass He stares down at her His gloved hands flex in
anticipation

ADRIENNE
Lets put us to bed hm

Adrienne stands Buttermilk sees the intruder and howls in
fright before clawing Adrienne in its desire for flight
Adrienne releases Buttermilk

ADRIENNE
Ow Buttermilk Whats wrong with
you

She turns and sees the intruder beyond the glass Adrienne
screams

The intruder picks up a deck chair and throws it through the
window which shatters into a thousand splinters

Adrienne retreats to the stairs as the intruder leaps through
the gaping hole in the glass and pursues

ADRIENNE
No No NNNnnnooocooo

STAIRS and HALLWAY - ADRIENNE and THE INTRUDER

One gloved hand grabs her ankle Another draws the blade
whose jagged edge glints from some unknown light Adrienne
kicks crawling backward up the stairs before throwing the
heavy flashlight catching the intruder in the face A
second is bought and Adrienne spends it separating herself --
two feet three four -- from the intruder before spinning to
run But his hands grope for her missing her heels by
inches as she ascends the stairs

Adrienne hears the intruders foot-fall behind her as she
reaches the bedroom doorway and through slamming the door
behind her
Deceptions by Richard Taylor 7

INT BEDROOM - NIGHT

Adrienne locks the door and retreats a step as something --
someone -- slams into it

ADRIENNE
No No Ill give you money
Just go away Please go away

The sound changes Before a shoulder blow now it is made by
a boot

Adrienne flinches each time the noise impacts and retreats
behind the bed She grabs the phone No dial tone
Adrienne lurches for something in the darkness as the jamb
begins to splinter An instant later the intruder bursts
through the door and leaps at her Adrienne spins and flees
as the intruders blade seeks her flesh

Suddenly a BANG anda brilliant burst of light Another
Another Muzzle flashes capture the intruder in a sequence
of still-lifes as hes thrown back across the room Six
portraits Then darkness

Adrienne lies sobbing on the floor

MOMENTS LATER

Adrienne crawls to a wall switch and light fills the room
She stands finally and looks at the hooded man who lies in
a pool of his own blood across the room

Adrienne approaches the body and leans close Her hand
reaches out and pauses inches from the stocking Then in a
brief brave instant she yanks the mask clear exposing the
dead face of

Her husband Douglas Ericksen

DISSOLVE TO
INT ERICKSEN BEDROOM - NIGHT
Adrienne her face tear-streaked sits in a chair across the
room from the body which is now being loaded onto a gurney
by two white-coated attendants Several uniformed LAPD

Porsche driver LAPD Detective Sergeant Pete Gentry
Deceptions by Richard Taylor 8

GENTRY
What then

But Adrienne has lapsed into never-never land Gently

GENTRY
What did you do after you
discovered it was your husband

Just outside the bedroom door DETECTIVE LEON KESSLER 55 a
burly knot of a man wearing more traditional cop clothes a
wrinkled sport combo and tie finishes taking a statement
from JOANNE PETERS an attractive woman Adriennes age and
enters the room jotting notes down on a small spiral-bound
tablet

ADRIENNE

I went downstairs but that
phone isnt working either

(stops almost loses

control)
Then I ran I ran to Joanne Peters
house Its the next one down the
beach

GENTRY
(gently)
Mrs Ericksen did you have any
idea that your husband wanted to
kill you

The very mention of it almost makes her reject it Then

ADRIENNE
No I love loved him I
thought he loved me

She cant deny a look at the sheet-covered body of her dead
husband as its wheeled out of the room Then she buries her
head in her hands and sobs gently Gentry obviously
sympathetic is helpless

Leon sits down on the bed Adrienne bobs adjusting to his
weight Then

LEON
Mrs Ericksen I gotta be honest
with you Something bothers me
here You say your husband left on
a business trip to San Francisco
this morning Then he comes back
here tonight breaks in and tries
to murder you with a knife

(MORE)
Gentry shoots his partner an angry look

Deceptions by Richard Taylor

LEON (contd)
And yet he forgets that he left his
-357 Magnum revolver in the bedside
table drawer That seems what
Pete Inconsistent

ADRIENNE

GENTRY
Mrs Ericksen its okay We can

Leon)

He reaches out

But Adrienne cannot hold back the torrent of rage pain and

tears

ADRIENNE
Well let me tell you Officer my
husband didnt know it was there
It was in the shop being repaired
I picked it up last week and forgot
to tell him about it

Joanne Peters seeing Adriennes mental state from the
doorway enters the room and rushes to Adriennes side

JOANNE
Addie are you okay

Joanne wraps her in protective arms trying to calm her

Adrienne collapses into sobs

ADRIENNE
(reality sinking in)
Forgot Forgot to tell him
Forgot

Joannes angry stare sears

into Gentry a moment before he turns to Leon and gestures
Outside Leon sighs and exits as Gentry rises
Deceptions by Richard Taylor 10

GENTRY
Mrs Ericksen we can finish taking
your statement tomorrow

HALLWAY and STAIRS - GENTRY and LEON
exit the bedroom and descend the stairs

GENTRY
Nice going Leon

LEON
Im not in the comfort business
Im in the truth business

GENTRY
Youre not going to gain anything
by turning her into a hostile
witness

LEON
If shes guilty shes already
hostile Just ask her husband

He glares at Gentry Gentry glares back Then he grins
These guys have been sparring for years Theres a facetious
cynicism to their banter

GENTRY
So what do you think

LEON
I think she did it

GENTRY
You think everybody did it

LEON
Everybody did do it They just
aint been caught

GENTRY
Got it figured huh

LEON
Well I dunno Pete Maybe he left
the gun in the drawer because he
was fair-minded and wanted to give
her a fighting chance What do you
think

GENTRY
I think Ill keep an open mind
Deceptions by Richard Taylor

LEON

You gotta watch that Who knows

EXT ERICKSEN HOUSE WALKWAY - NIGHT

unmarked police cruiser and a moment later its engine fires
Leon throws Gentry a wave and backs the car out

Gentry stops beside his Porsche and digs for the keys
Something captures his attention

A large window in the Ericksen guest bedroom Adrienne stops
and stares off into space A moment later she removes the
robe and stands nude and beautiful before the glass

Finally she moves away

Gentry stands frozen unable to move Adrienne

her He takes her into his arms and is about to kiss her when
she pulls away

LINDA

As if introduced the door opens and her FRIEND takes a step
into the hall Hes one sweat-stained muscle He wears a
towel Nothing else

LINDAS FRIEND

and frowns Linda writhes free

Disgusted Gentry enters his apartment before she can finish
explaining

INT GENTRYS APARTMENT - NIGHT

Neat it isnt Nor homey Nor telling of the man who lives

Rhythmic Lindas bed hitting the wall And then another

noise A womans voice Lindas Ecstasy

record-keeper

rail allowing the wind to caress him His body language
seems to say God I could get used to this Then he sees

Adrienne running from the sea She wears a skimpy bikini

her hair tussled and sexy She moves up the beach and

doesnt notice the man standing on her deck until she is half-
way up the steps
Deceptions by Richard Taylor 17

ADRIENNE
Oh

GENTRY
Sorry Didnt mean to startle you

Gentrys cant help himself Hes taking in every inch of
her

Adrienne attempts to break the spell shes cast on Gentry by
continuing up the steps

ADRIENNE
I often take a swim in the morning
The beach is lonely then and the
water cool

GENTRY
Nice To be able to do that I
mean

She has stopped not two feet from him and hes doing a
terrible job of hiding his lust She inches closer then

ADRIENNE
Youre blocking my way To the
door

Stepping out of the way

GENTRY
Oh Sorry

He follows her inside
INT ERICKSEN HOUSE - DAY

Gentry watches Adrienne cross the living room to a closet
where a short terricloth robe hangs She pulls it on turns
before his sight can rise She cinches the robe with
finality

ADRIENNE
Im flattered Sergeant Under
happier circumstances I would be
very flattered Can I get you
something

GENTRY

Deceptions by Richard Taylor 18

ADRIENNE
To drink
(moving to kitchen)
No Youre a cop and youre on
duty so you dont drink Well I

She finds a bottle in a cupboard reaches up to get it
Gentry watches the robe ride up her long lovely legs

GENTRY
Bourbon

Surprised she looks over her shoulder at him then pours
several fingers of Bourbon into a water glass drops in ice

ADRIENNE
(giving him drink)
Im trying to adjust my
thinking Trying to see things the
way they are Its funny The
world doesnt look any different

GENTRY
(gesturing plywood)
You seem to be doing okay Youve
already arranged for the glass to
be replaced

Leading him into the living room area

ADRIENNE
Oh that Joanne made the
arrangements this morning Shes
been very supportive

GENTRY
Did you spend the night here

ADRIENNE
(with difficulty)
Yes In the guest bedroom I
couldnt stay in there With
Douglass blood on the carpet I
mean Its like part of him is
still up there

Seeing her pain Gentry takes a gulp of his drink and shifts
gears
Deceptions by Richard Taylor

GENTRY
(opening notebook)
Mrs Ericksen I need to finish
taking your statement For our
report

ADRIENNE
Certainly I1l cooperate any way
I can

GENTRY
You said last night that your
husbands gun had only recently
come back from the gunsmiths When
was that

ADRIENNE
A couple of weeks I dont
remember the exact date Theres
an invoice around here somewhere
(rising)
I can get it --

GENTRY
Not necessary I just need a name

ADRIENNE
Santa Monica Gun and Rail
Something like that Its on
Lincoln Boulevard

GENTRY
The owner called you

ADRIENNE
I imagine hes the owner

GENTRY
He called you

ADRIENNE
Yes Is that important

GENTRY
Well it tends to substantiate that
the gun was in the drawer by
circumstance The time and date of
its return was not under your
control

ADRIENNE
I dont understand Why is that
important

Deceptions by Richard Taylor 20

GENTRY
It suggests there wasnt
premeditation involved in your
husbands death

Adriennes eyes bore into him Finally

ADRIENNE
That man last night That police
officer

GENTRY
Detective Kessler

ADRIENNE
I thought he was just an ugly
little man I didnt take him
seriously Im under suspicion for

GENTRY
All possibilities are considered in
a homicide investigation

Adrienne flinches at the word homicide and turns her eyes
away When again she looks at Gentry her eyes are red and
tear-filled

ADRIENNE
I loved my husband Sergeant I
loved him passionately If he

hadnt been wearing a mask I dont
think I could have pulled the
trigger

Tears roll down her cheeks She is fighting to retain
control of herself Gentry is silenced by her emotions
Finally

GENTRY
Mrs Ericksen Ive got to cover
this territory

She gestures a mute consent

GENTRY
How was your husbands business
going Were there financial
problems
Deceptions by Richard Taylor 21

Adrienne straightens gains control over herself These are
every-day matters

ADRIENNE
My husband was a financial advisor
He always made a good income As
far as I know everything was fine

GENTRY
He didnt bring his work home with
him

ADRIENNE

No Douglas kept work and home
separate When he worked he
worked hard When he played
well He never talked business

GENTRY
Ill need a business address

ADRIENNE
Three eleven Hauser Thats in
Beverly Hills

GENTRY
(jotting down address)
Did you and your husband have a
death benefit insurance policy

ADRIENNE
Yes He keeps kept all of our
important papers in the floor safe
at his office Its a substantial
sum I dont recall the amount I
saw it for all of five minutes

GENTRY
Do you have the combination to your
husbands safe

ADRIENNE
No The subject just never came
up Douglas took care of me He
was that kind of man

Gentry pauses gauging her durability before asking
GENTRY
Did you ever suspect there might be

another woman

The pain of the question rolls across her expression
Deceptions by Richard Taylor 22

ADRIENNE
No Never

GENTRY
Is it possible he could have been
seeing someone and you not know
about it

ADRIENNE
No I dont think so
(tearful)
Sergeant I dont know what to
believe about my husband Not
anymore

Gentry leans close

GENTRY
Mrs Ericksen the best possible
scenario we can make of this is
that your husband attempted to
murder you in cold blood He did
that for some reason Youve got
to help me find that reason

Adrienne writhes with the question shaking tears cascading
down her cheeks as her mind questions everything her married
life has been up until this moment

ADRIENNE
I dont know I dont know
(sobbing)

I dont know-I dont know-I dont
know why my husband didnt love
me

She collapses into herself burying her head in her arms

Gentry struggles with himself His professionalism dictates
that he retain distance And yet Gentry rises crosses
to the couch lays a hand on her shoulder

GENTRY
Mrs Ericksen is there anything I
can --

Adrienne turns and buries herself in Gentrys arms

Startled Gentry pulls her into an embrace His hand reaches
out to stroke her hair but stops inches from contact
Sensing his awkwardness she looks up Their eyes connect
Each realizes desire for the other Finally she pulls away
Deceptions by Richard Taylor 23

ADRIENNE
(straightening)
Im sorry I shouldnt act like

Shaky she turns away Gentry reaches out to steady her

GENTRY
Can I get you something

ADRIENNE
No Actually I have a
prescription Something to calm me

down

GENTRY
Youve seen your doctor since last
night

Adrienne pulls away begins to move for the stairs

ADRIENNE
No I take them for I get
depressed sometimes Sergeant
Im sorry but they usually make me
sleep Perhaps tomorrow

GENTRY
Sure Tomorrow

Gentry watches as she ascends the stairs A part of him
wants to follow her He hears the door upstairs close before
turning and moving for the exit

Deceptions by Richard Taylor 27

He gives her a shove She collides with the stove and burns
her arm Handgun pays her no mind

Shotgun is grinning and sweating The glare in his eyes says
Please Someone fuck up and let me kill

Gentrys eyes meet Leons Not here Not now Too many
targets

Fate intervenes A teenage girl exits the womens room
unaware of whats going on and startles Shotgun who pivots
and fires

The round impacts near the girl Gentry pulls his service
revolver as Shotgun pumps another round into the chamber
Shotgun aims at the girl enraged that she should expose his
fear as Gentry takes aim

GENTRY
Police Freeze

Shotgun pivots and fires at Gentry in one instinctive motion
Gentry leaps behind a table as the shotgun round takes out
the plate glass behind him which shatters into ten thousand
pieces

Shotgun turns his weapon on Leon who just now has cleared
his service revolver He drops like dead weight as across
the fast food restaurant Gentry rises and fires twice --
Bang Bang to send Shotgun sprawling but not before his
last round flips Leons hiding table away as if it were a
tent flap in the wind

Behind the counter Handgun has witnessed the robbery turn to
merde and grabs the register girl retreating toward the rear
exit as she screams for help

Leon advances with his revolver as Shotgun bloodied but not
out crawls toward his weapon Leon cocks the revolver

LEON
Move and you die asshole

Shotguns eyes meet Leons His fingers are mere inches from
the shotgun He freezes

Gentry leaps the counter the moment Handgun drags the girl
out of the place A second later he bursts through the door
Deceptions by Richard Taylor 28

EXT REAR OF FAST FOOD JOINT - DAY

Gentry explodes through the door weapon readied only to
find the countergirl screaming hysterically and Handgun
nowhere to be found

GENTRY
Where is he Where did he go

The countergirl wont stop screaming but gestures toward the
back alley Gentry takes off

FOLLOW GENTRY and HANDGUN

running flat-out at opposite ends of an alley Handgun
pivots in full flight sees Gentry sprinting toward him and
leaps laterally behind trash cans for cover

Gentry sees Handguns maneuver but continues forward moving

toward one side of the alley as Handgun rises and fires
Gentry dives for a hill of abandoned storage flats rising
once to return fire before moving closer

Handgun rises and lays down a barrage of fire as he retreats
down an intersecting alley Gentry leaps for cover as the
rounds impact where he stood moments before then rises and
paces after the retreating gunman

ANOTHER ALLEY - FOLLOW THE ACTION

as Gentry turns into the alley and sees that its a dead-end
Four and five story buildings make the wall of the alley and
at its end a locked gated fence Gentry advances service
revolver held ready looking left and right a swinging
motion the rhythm of predator seeking prey

A flattened cardboard box to one side moves an inch Gentry
aims his weapon at the box and advances

GENTRY
Police officer Throw out your
weapon

A lizard squirms from beneath the box an instant before
Handgun bursts from behind oil drums on the other side of the
alley He throws his empty gun at Gentry and explodes past
him

Gentry dodges the thrown gun aims his revolver -- an easy
shot
Deceptions by Richard Taylor 29

GENTRY
Stop or Ill shoot

Handgun is in full flight He has no intention of stopping
Gentry holsters his revolver and pursues

Handgun hits a fence and is nearly over when Gentrys hands
yank him down Gentry has forty pounds of muscle on the kid
who responds to being manhandled by pulling a switchblade
His first swipe cuts Gentrys cheek His second is stopped
inches from penetrating Gentrys face Gentry forces the
knife-wielding arm back breaks the kids grip then hits him
square in the face Bam The kid goes down Gentry
straddles Handgun and continues pounding on him -- Bam-Bam-
Bam -- the violence a catharsis

Leon rushing up the alley sees whats happening and moves
to pull Gentry off the latino gang member

LEON
Okay Okay Youve got him Pete
Youve got him

GENTRY
Youre under arrest asshole

Leon jerks Gentry free

LEON
Okay I think he knows that

Gentry wants more of him and in coiled frustration pivots and
marches down the alley as Leon cuffs the kid

EXT REAR OF FAST FOOD PLACE - DAY
Leon guides the manacled Handgun up the alley toward waiting

black-and-whites and an ambulance Gentry leans against his
Porsche smoking a cigarette

Leon turns Handgun over to two blue suits gives them unheard
instructions then walks to Gentry as nearby Shotgun is
loaded into the ambulance on a gurney

Gentry stops in the doorway from the bathroom and takes in
the room Gentry quickly peruses the top of Adriennes
vanity noting ironically her brand of perfume Deceit
before moving to her desk

At the desk Gentry takes one look over his shoulder at the
open bathroom door Steam still rises billowing out

Gentry sits thinks about it a moment then pulls open the
drawer He finds Adriennes appointment and address book

He opens it begins going down the list First page
Nothing Second No Third

Adrienne grabs him from behind She cups his eyes and
laughs her naked soapy body staining his clothes Gentry
twists and the appointmentaddress book tumbles to the floor
Addie falls into his arms unaware or uncaring about the
book For a long moment he holds her their eyes locked His
eyes take in her wet exquisite body She begins to unbutton
his shirt then rips it open in frustration kissing his
chest and nipples

ADRIENNE
(between kisses)
Pete Im sorry so sorry I
cant help it I
want you to Oh

Gentrys reserve breaks like a cracked dam He stands and
yanks her up into his arms and carries her to the bed She
crashes onto it but is up in an instant to undo his pants
MOMENTS LATER

their naked bodies writhe in unleashed lust Addie cries in
pleasure and sweet pain as Gentry grabs her great mane of
hair riding forward like a charging warrior

LATER EVEN YET

they lie entwined lovers whose last drop of passion has been
spent on the other

spins around only to find her cat Buttermilk meowing for

pulls into traffic

The point of view follows him

walks toward the phone An instant later Fenady has dialed
the phone He grins obviously talking to someone very
intimate Still grinning he hangs up goes to the door and
unlocks it

THE MOVING POINT OF VIEW

navigates around the side of the house through the bushes to
the REAR DECK watching as Fenady wearing only a towel
exits the house while pulling the cork out of a bottle of
champagne He drops the bottle into an ice bucket slips a
cassette into a nearby boom box yanks the towel free and
slides into a steaming hot tub
Deceptions by Richard Taylor 59

THE POINT OF VIEW MOVES CLOSER

as Fenady oblivious to this intruder pours himself a glass
of champagne and settles back for a little hedonistic
pleasure

Gloved hands -- those of this intruder -- reach out and lift
the boom box over the back of Fenadys head Still plugged
in the box drops into the water Fenadys spasmodic body
almost leaps from the tub But he settles back into the
frothy mass of water boiling like a two-minute egg

A MOMENT LATER

Gentry and Leon make their way to the door

LEON

Okay maybe it was an accident
GENTRY

Maybe
LEON

Or maybe Ericksens girlfriend is
trying to get rid of any witnesses
Fenady could have tied her to the
attempted murder of Mrs Ericksen

GENTRY
Maybe

LEON
I could believe it myself except
for one thing

GENTRY
Whats that
Deceptions by Richard Taylor 62

LEON
How did she find out about Fenady
Howd she get his address

But Gentrys mind is too occupied with dark thoughts for him
to respond Adrienne The police sketch Then

LEON
You know what I think I think the
girlfriend was the brains behind
Ericksen Shes the one who talked
him into trying to kill his wife
I think we got one smart crazy
bitch out there

to look at Gentry Sensing his emotional distance she comes
up behind him loops her arms through his then circles him

herself

pulls a folded Xerox of Adriennelook-alike from his pocket

and gives it to her

Adrienne gestures yes

ADRIENNE

The Mercedes shoots through the intersection barely missing
two crossing cars and continues on Gentry twisting its
wheel to avoid hitting anyone and slamming his foot on the

Marta brings a weapon up She aims it at Adrienne not
Gentry

Focused on each other neither Gentry nor Adrienne have seen
Marta until this moment Gentry leaps across the darkness
knocking Adrienne to the ground as muzzleflash after
muzzleflash explode in the darkness

By the time Gentry is on his feet the woman has disappeared
He finds Adrienne

GENTRY
Are you okay

ADRIENNE
Yes Marta

Gentry bolts for the door

GENTRY
I dont care The car was parked a
hundred yards north of here but it
may haven been in the neighborhood

probably waiting for the right
moment to act Any questions

No The moment Gentrys finished with the blue suits he
turns and catches Leons look Gentry moves toward the
house Leon stops him

LEON
Looks like you were right

GENTRY
Hows that

LEON

Deceptions by Richard Taylor 82

Gentry studies her a long while before

GENTRY
I was wrong

The admission elicits nothing from Addie Her mind is far
away

GENTRY
I thought I had enough reasons--

ADRIENNE
How could you sleep with me and
believe I was a murderer

Gentry is startled by the question and the look of intense
anger etched into her features

GENTRY
Addie I --

ADRIENNE
How could you make love to me
(angry and tearful)
and believe that

EXT ADRIENNES HOUSE - NIGHT

Leon stands just outside the window He sees Gentry and
Adrienne talking and can barely hear the conversation
Pulling a penlight from a jacket pocket Leon squats with an
Oomph and trails the penlight across the sand

LEON
Jesus Im getting too old for this

Even from here he can hear snippets of Gentry and Adriennes
conversation between the crashing of waves

GENTRYS VOICE
I said I was wrong Im sorry

ADRIENNES VOICE
But how could you believe that
Pete Dont you know me Dont
you know who I am by now

Leons penlight beam is picking up nothing but sand and a
myriad of footprints He sees something and reaches for it

GENTRYS VOICE

When she doesnt respond Gentry moves for the door Its
open and hes halfway through it when she spins

him to see her expression He walks toward her Halfway
there he sees the tears in her eyes He continues until
their bodies unite He pulls her close

Buttermilk has curled up in her lap and she pets the cat

thing is for you to accept police
protection and go to a hotel

ADRIENNE

Buttermilk stretches then wanders off

EXTINT GENTRYS PORSCHE - NIGHT

Gentry drives with passionate abandon His steely eyes are
fixed on the road ahead and farther the beach house and what
waits for him there

EXT A LONELY STRETCH OF BEACH - NIGHT

The Porsche screeches to a stop at the edge of a dune dust
billowing behind it Gentry leaps free of the car pops the
front trunk pulls out a suitcase Removing his jacket
Gentry pulls shirts and slacks from the case and tosses them
aside until he finds a dark turtle-neck sweater and pulls it
on

From a crumpled sack on the passenger seat Gentry takes a can
of black shoe polish and spreads it across cheek and brow A
moment later hes pulled a knit cap over his hair and ears
He tapes a knife to one calf

Looking like a commando now Gentry moves for the beach

EXT BEACH SIDE OF ERICKSEN HOUSE - NIGHT

Gentry pauses near the surf The house is completely dark
He makes for it

NEAR THE DECK - GENTRY

pauses and listens The roar of the sea drowns everything
Creeping closer Gentry sees movement at the window a brief
formless shape passing in the moonlight

Gentry flattens onto the deck and rests cheek-to-board for
a long moment Then like a snake he crawls toward the

glass door

Inches from the glass Gentry looks inside
Deceptions by Richard Taylor 100

INT ERICKSEN HOUSE - NIGHT

A surreal scene Leon sits in one chair Leons corpse is
out of Gentrys line-of-sight

Adrienne sits absolutely still on the couch She might be
dead herself until her eyes betray a look at the glass
and the sea beyond Can she see Gentry

A form in near shadow A gun in its hand
EXT ERICKSEN HOUSE - NIGHT

Gentry brings his weapon up and waits for the shadow to
become a target It denies him The shadow flits to another
darkness this nebula behind Adrienne whose body shields it
Suppressing a curse Gentry slowly returns the gun to his
belt and retreats from the glass

At the decks edge Gentry rolls to the sand and makes his
way along the front of the house to the side walkway

At the side door Gentry drops to his knees and maneuvers
below the window-line past the entrance

Gentry ascends the wall of the garage to the second floor
then up to the master bedroom window A moment later hes
inside

INT ADRIENNES BEDROOM - NIGHT

Gentry turns from the window and knocks a lamp from its
perch catching it inches from the floor

A moment later hes at the door Like the night of Douglas
Ericksens death the door squeaks as it is pulled open

From below

MARTAS VOICE

Half through the doorway Gentry listens to

ADRIENNES VOICE
What TI didnt hear anything

MARTAS VOICE
A noise From the stairs

No choice now He continues through
Deceptions by Richard Taylor 101

STAIRS - GENTRY

pulls his service revolver and moves with stealth to the top
of the stairs

ADRIENNES VOICE
Its nothing Its probably my
cat Buttermilk

MARTA
(rough)
Were going to check it out anyway

Gentry assumes a firing position with the revolver pointed
downward into the well of darkness He hears footsteps
and then the meow of a cat as it prances across the threshold
of the stairs below

Adrienne having just moved into moonlight picks up the cat

ADRIENNE
See I told you It was just
Buttermilk

MARTA

Come on Back over here

Adrienne turns Her eyes trail upward She sees Gentry
Their eyes lock She continues to pet the cat automatically
before

ADRIENNE
Its all right Buttermilk Its
all right

Holding the cat to her cheek Adrienne turns and does what
Marta has told her to do

Gentry descends the steps One at a time Slowly Each
foot-fall measured to deny noise The gun held out and
aimed prepared to fire Voices Martas Adriennes
Words lost to the hiss of Gentrys breathing Sweat cascades
from his brow sweat and shoe polish dripping to the carpet
Still he moves forward

LIVING ROOM - GENTRY
reaches the base of the stairs He sees Adrienne sitting
before the window still petting the cat Across from her

another form obscured by darkness

ADRIENNE
Hes not coming
Deceptions by Richard Taylor 102

MARTAS VOICE
The hell hes not

ADRIENNE
This isnt going to work

MARTAS VOICE
You better hope it does

Gentry moves forward until hes mere feet from the sitting
form obscured by darkness Then

GENTRY
Freeze Dont move

The silence is deafening No motion at all Finally

GENTRY
Adrienne turn on a light

Adrienne stands moves to the end of the couch reaches over
and switches the lamp on

Gentry stares down the barrel of his cocked gun at Leons
corpse Stunned he cannot move

ADRIENNE
Hes dead Pete

A mindless reaction Gentry pivots to face Marta who stands
across the room her weapon aimed at Adrienne

MARTA
Drop it Or Ill kill her

Adrienne stands between them an easy target Gentry lowers
his weapon drops it

Marta moves forward gestures Gentry to move back takes the
weapon he dropped on the floor The moment the gun is in
Martas possession Adrienne steps forward and kisses Marta
lustily

Adrienne pulls back and grins at Gentry who stands mute

MARTA
So tell me darling what kind of
fuck is he

ADRIENNE
Not bad actually Not as good as
you but not bad at all
Deceptions by Richard Taylor 103

MARTA
Lots of enthusiasm I imagine

ADRIENNE
(appraising Gentry)
Yes thats one way to put it

They see Gentrys dumb-struck look and laugh
ADRIENNE

Youd better tell him or hes
liable to have a heart attack

MARTA
Cant have that can we Too

Marta reaches up and pulls the wig off Marta becomes Paul

Basque before our eyes

MARTAPAUL
So you see were not perverse
killers Sergeant Gentry just the
normal kind Heterosexual that
is Sit down
(to Adrienne)
Bring me my clothes

Adrienne ascends the stairs to the bedroom as Gentry sits
beside Leon who topples onto him Gentry catches the corpse
of his friend and as if realizing that hes dead for the
first time gently lowers Leon to the floor

PAUL
A casualty of poor planning your
friend

Gentrys look of anger and hatred surprises even Paul

PAUL
Dont get any ideas I enjoy
killing Its more fun than
anything except
(grin)
stealing that extra bow

Adrienne returns with Pauls clothes He gives her Gentrys
gun She trains it on Gentry

PAUL
Dont kill him unless you have to

Paul removes the blouse and padded bra
Deceptions by Richard Taylor 104

PAUL
Sergeant Gentry were going to
make a little deal The honest
truth is we bungled the job We
thought wed planned an air-tight
murder but as you well know it
started to unravel almost
immediately

The skirt drops to the floor revealing pantihose and beneath
them jockey shorts He kicks off the heels sits to remove
the pantihose

PAUL
Now it doesnt matter if we kill
you or not your successor will
come to the same conclusions you
would have come to which is that
Adrienne and an accomplice killed
her husband for his money So
we have to get rid of Adrienne
Ericksen too

GENTRY
What makes you think youre getting
any better at this

Naked but for the jockey shorts Paul pulls on jeans and a t-
shirt

PAUL
This is the you cant get away
with it speech Save it If we
get caught now we both fry and we
know it There are a number of
witnesses who saw a woman matching
Martas description accompany
Adrienne Ericksen this afternoon as
she withdrew two million dollars in
insurance money from her account
Tomorrow or the next day someones
going to find Detective Kesslers
body there

GENTRY
Or maybe theyll find mine

Paul stops for only a moment before using a garment to wipe
make-up from his face He grins
Deceptions by Richard Taylor 105

PAUL
Or maybe theyll find yours out in
the desert where you chased Marta
and her prisoner and she killed you
in a fire-fight

Dressed now Paul gathers up his Marta clothes and ties
them together with a belt

PAUL

Theyll also find lots of blood in
Adriennes car Adriennes blood
Shes already donated it Its in
the fridge Theyll assume the
worst Adriennes dead Officers
Gentry and Kessler dead And Marta
a very wealthy psychopath

GENTRY
It wont hold up Somebody11
break it wide

PAUL
Doesnt matter Theyll look for a
woman As you can see something
Im not

Dressed now Paul returns and gestures for Adrienne to give
him her weapon The moment she does Gentry dives for the
endtable lamp Paul fires hitting Gentry as he flies across
the couch and behind the light dying behind him

PAUL
Out of the way

Paul pushes Adrienne toward the glass door and fires three
times each round providing a flash of illumination

Gentry behind the couch yanks the knife free from where he
taped it to his calf and crawls away from the flashes

PAUL
Turn on the lights Turn on the
lights

Paul almost topples over a table before he reaches the wall
where the light switch is located The light flashes on
to disclose Gentry standing across the room waiting The
moment Paul turns Gentrys knife thuds into his chest and he
drops already dead to the floor

Gentry and Adrienne stand across the room from one another
Gentry defenseless Adrienne still armed with a handgun
Deceptions by Richard Taylor 106

He hobbles toward her the red stain on the left side of his
ribcage widening as he moves Adrienne brings the pistol up
Gentry continues She cocks the weapon Gentry gets closer
Her finger tenses Closer Finger squeezing Closer

She lowers the gun

ADRIENNE
I never wanted to hurt you Pete I
love you Paul made me do it He
was crazy I was afraid of him
Afraid that if I didnt --

He takes the gun from her

ADRIENNE
I have the money We can figure
something out cant we Something
to explain all this Because I
love you Pete We can be rich and
we can be together

Gentry is in tremendous pain Blood seeps out of him He
blinks to retain consciousness And theres more After

everything shes done there remains in Gentry feeling for
Adrienne

Adrienne looks up into his eyes Her beauty is exquisite

ADRIENNE
We can think of something to say
