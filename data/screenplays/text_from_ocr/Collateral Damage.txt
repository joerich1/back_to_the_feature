And then

Theres only silence

INT GORDYS APARTMENT - MATTS BEDROOM - NIGHT

Gordy stands at an open closet door He leans in buries
his face in Matts clothes and smells them Smells his
son

INT LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

The TV is ON LOW tuned to the NEWS Gordy is alone
slumped in a chair

NEWS ANCHOR

NEWS ANCHOR (VO)
The bombing that left a mother
and son dead and New York City
numb took on a new dimension today
when a notorious Latin American
terrorist took credit for the

attack

has roused from his despondency TURNS UP the VOLUME as
the report (containing visuals) continues --
NEWS ANCHOR 62

NEWS ANCHOR (VO)
In an e-mail to the New York
Times a Marxist extremist known
only as The Wolf states that
the bombing was quote not an
act of terror but an act of war
aimed at stopping your CIA
murderers and their fascist puppets
from committing further acts of
repression against the people of
Colombia unquote Two
Colombian officials and an
American military officer died
in last Thursdays blast Also
killed were Anne Pitt wife of a
New York City firefighter and
their only child four-year-old
Matt The President has vowed
that the United States will avenge
what he called this monstrous act
of barbarism and cowardice
Intelligence sources say the
identity and whereabouts of The
Wolf remain a mystery They
believe he has worked closely with
radical elements in Latin America
for more than twenty years and
have linked him to numerous
terrorist bombings including the
1983 downing of a Peruvian
airliner which killed forty-two
people eleven of them
Americans The head of the Latin

America Indigenous Peoples
Committee a group known to be
sympathetic to the radicals in
Colombia talked to News Six in
Queens

GORDY 63

watches as Ephraim Ortiz-Dominguez a Latin man in his
forties comes on the screen

ORTIZ-DOMINGUEZ 64

ORTIZ-DOMINGUEZ (VO)

I cannot speak for The Wolf or his
actions I would only repeat that
the leftist guerrillas in Colombia
are not terrorists but freedom
fighters in a war being waged
against them by the US and
Colombian governments
Governments who wish only to
protect a system that lines the
pockets of corrupt politicians and
multi-national profiteers

(jump cut)
The deaths of the woman and little
boy are regrettable but your
government inflicts them all the
time Yugoslavia Iraq You
call it collateral damage

INT VACANT SECOND-FLOOR OFFICE (QUEENS) - NIGHT 65

An FBI SURVEILLANCE TEAM has taken over the office

The FBI agents listen to live audio from the IPC office

ORTIZ-DOMINGUEZ (VO)
Rosetta I said mustard on the

INT NEW YORK TIMES - BULLPEN - DAY 69
Gordy talks to a Latin reporter ERNIE OROSCO
OROSCO
You interested in the big picture
or all the unpleasant details
GORDY
My family died because of whats

going on down there I want to
know all I can

Orosco searches for a starting point Then --

OROSCO
Well basically the situation in
Colombia sucks

As Orosco continues

MONTAGE - DAYNIGHT 70
Over the course of a week

1 Gordy takes pictures etc off a wall in his home
He pins up photos of Anne and Matt at the top of the
wall Beneath them he pins up a large map of Colombia

OROSCO (V0O)

The governments been fighting
different Marxists factions for
over thirty-five years For most
of that time it was winning

NEW YORK PUBLIC LIBRARY 71

2 At the New York Public Library Gordy uses microfilm
files and computer access to the web to search out
information on Colombia and The Wolf

OROSCO (VO)

Suddenly the guerrillas began
chopping em up High-tech
weapons and equipment well-
trained troops aggressive hit-
and-run tactics all financed by
extortion kidnapping and
collecting taxes from dope
growers Its big money and they
put it to use

GORDY 72

3 Gordy pins up various Colombia-related articles and
pictures on the wall including the surveillance camera still of
The Wolf from the front page of The New York Post

OROSCO (VO)
The government got scared In
1998 to jump start peace talks
it gave a coalition of guerrilla
groups temporary control over much
of southern Colombia The first
communist stronghold on an
American continent

73 GORDY 73
4 Gordy draws a line around the guerrilla zone

OROSCO (VO)

But thereve been few talks
and no peace And the Colombian
military cant get near the
guerrilla zone especially around
the town of Caguan where the
ELC kicks ass and takes no
prisoners

74 GORDY 74
5 Gordy circles and labels the ELC-controlled area

OROSCO (VO)

And thats where we come in
Supposedly to help eliminate
narcos operating in the guerrilla
zone But some well-informed
people think thats just an excuse
to hit the guerrillas themselves
since theyre wrapped around the
drug trade Were there were
involved If we stay the only
real question is which Vietnam War
were gonna have The one some
feel we couldve won or the one we
lost

75 GORDY 75
6 Gordy watches a documentary about Colombia which
shows rebels army troops death squads firefights and with
atrocities and bodies on both sides

75

OROSCO (VO)

Bottom line The place is as
dangerous as a snakepit Youve
got the different guerrilla groups
CIA FBI DEA Colombian
military US military right-
wing death squads -- and the only
thing theyve all managed to do is
destroy a beautiful country and
inflict suffering on the real

idea is to inhibit the northbound migration of people and
drugs From this point south lies the Darien Gap a

thick rain forest traversed only by rough trail

forest

rushing fiercely through the jungle Ever uses his
machete to cut two lengths of bamboo He hands one to
Gordy and indicates how theyll ford the stream Gordy
nods then follows Evers lead into the perilous belly-
deep water They struggle to maintain their balance
even with the sticks When they reach the opposite bank
Ever signs okay to Gordy and smiles

HELICOPTER CARCASS 91

They pass the carcass of a crashed and burned-out
helicopter when

Two dangerous-looking men armed with assault rifles step
out of nowhere onto the path ahead of Gordy and Ever
Gordy and Ever stop Gordy glances at Ever Evers
focused on the men and clearly doesnt like what he sees
Gordy looks back The armed men advance toward them
carefully rifles in the ready position Gordy watches
them approach wondering who they are and what theyre
going to do Ever frightened takes a half-step back
then swings the length of bamboo fast and hard and

( )

He smashes it into the base of Gordys head knocking

but its not serious He searches his pockets and

Gordy stands Looks around Hes alone Hes in the
jungle He keeps heading south

EXT DARIEN GAP - VARIOUS SHOTS - DAY

Gordy trudges on The thick jungles hot and humid
full of STRANGE SOUNDS and shadowy animal movements

Gordys going uphill when he rounds a bend in the trail
and

He meets a man coming the other way Alarm gives way to
the realization that the man is followed by a number of
people including women and children As they pass

Gordy its apparent theyre refugees from their haunted
expressions and crude backpacks heavy with possessions

Gordy addresses the passing people Indicates where hes
standing
GORDY
Aqui Colombia

No one replies Then a small COLOMBIAN GIRL comes up and
gets his attention She runs back up the trail a short
distance and stops She draws a line in the dirt

COLOMBIAN GIRL
Panama

She jumps backward over the line

COLOMBIAN GIRL
Colombia

She does it again

COLOMBIAN GIRL
Panama Colombia

She smiles At the sound of a sharp WHISTLE however
she runs back quickly passing Gordy and rejoining her
family Her father hands her a machete and a Zippo
lighter says something to her Whereupon the little
girl returns to Gordy and holds the items out to him
Beat Gordy takes them

GORDY
Gracias

The little girl runs back again and Gordy watches the
refugees disappear around the bend Then turns back
uphill and approaches the line the little girl drew in
the dirt Looks down at it Crossing over means he

walks into a world dangerous enough to cause these people
to flee for their lives and

Just as Gordy charged into the fire-engulfed tenement
past a tide of more sensible rats going the other way he
now steps over the line and advances into Colombia

EXT PARQUE NACIONAL LOS KATIOS (COLOMBIA) - DAYNIGHT

Darkness sets in as Gordy follows the trail downhill At
night the JUNGLES EVEN NOISIER When

EVERYTHING GOES QUIET Gordy slows And suddenly
AUTOMATIC WEAPONS begin to POP somewhere Not close but
not far either A FEW BURSTS some SINGLE SHOTS -- the
call and response of an ambush -- and then SILENCE And
then the nighttime JUNGLE NOISES return

As Gordy walks on

EXT PARQUE NACIONAL LOS KATIOS - MORNING

The sun is already cooking the jungle as Gordy reaches a
break in the trees sees a small town ahead

NEARBY - MOMENTS LATER

Gordy has left the trail He lowers his pants just
enough to expose his injured thigh A bandage covers the
wound made by the glass shard Gordy unwraps the
bandage revealing

A wad of cash is hidden inside along with a photo of
Anne and Matt A long livid scar marks the wound

Gordy studies the photo of Anne and Matt a moment then
removes some cash from the wad and re-wraps the money and
photo inside the bandage

BACK ON TRAIL

Gordy heads into the town

EXTINT CHIVA - NIGHT

One of the colorful wretchedly overcrowded buses that
ply Colombias back-country roads

small-statured Colombians pressed in around him

A MAN IN A YANKEES CAP is among the people getting off
He answers in accented English

MAN IN YANKEES CAP
There is a military checkpoint up

starts to pick up speed again Gordy gets off just in
time To the Man in the Yankees Cap --

GORDY
Where are all of you going

The man heads into the forest Beat Gordy follows

EXT FOREST - NIGHT

To the Man in the Yankees Cap as they walk --

GORDY
None of these people have papers

MAN IN YANKEES CAP
Some have the wrong papers Some
have none

The man puts a finger to his lips hushing Gordy

Theyve come abreast of the checkpoint which can be seen
in the distance through the trees Colombian soldiers
have the chiva blocked as they perform their inspection
The chivas DIESEL GROWLS loudly When suddenly

FIGURES

We see figures moving in the forest between the group and
the checkpoint And then

The forest erupts in a deafening fusillade of AUTOMATIC
WEAPONS FIRE being directed at the soldiers at the
checkpoint In the same instant an RPG takes out a
Colombian Army humvee in a bright fiery EXPLOSION

MAN IN YANKEES CAP
Alsuelo

The man pulls Gordy down as the group hits the dirt The
GUNFIRE continues On the ground to Gordy --

MAN IN YANKEES CAP
Guerrilleros

The attack rages furiously for twenty seconds then wanes
to sporadic GUNFIRE Other WEAPONS are FIRING now

too -- clearly the Army is finally mounting a defense
And then

FOREST

We hear the sound of PEOPLE CRASHING through the forest
Theyre running toward Gordy and the group The CRASHING
GETS CLOSER And now Gordy begins to hear the BREATHLESS
PANTING of the guerrillas in retreat BOOTS THUD past
Gordys head When suddenly

One of the running guerrillas trips over Gordy and goes
sprawling The guerrilla wearing the motley uniform of

an irregular soldier whips a look back and

Gordy finds himself staring into the battle-hardened eyes
of a fierce young woman In a heartbeat

The woman jumps back to her feet and joins her comrades
laying down a suppressing FIRE at the soldiers Spent
cartridges rain down around Gordy as the AK-47 ON FULL
AUTO chops loudly over his head And then

NEW ANGLE

The guerrillas are gone
The Man in the Yankees hat hauls Gordy up yells --

MAN IN YANKEES CAP
Vaya

The group is in the greatest danger now -- caught between
the fleeing guerrillas and the soldiers who are giving
chase and will shoot anyone or thing in front of them
Everyone in the group scrambles to his or her feet and
begins to run And

Soldiers do notice them and begin to FIRE

FOLIAGE

BULLETS SHRED the foliage around Gordy whipping past his
head He and others keep running A man goes down when
a BULLET BITES into his leg Gordy slows but the Man in
Yankees Cap wont let him stop to help Slams him hard
on his back Keeps pushing Gordy forward A few moments
later we hear M-16s on FULL AUTO back where they left
the man

MAN IN YANKEES CAP
His trouble is over

EXT SMALL RIVER

The powerful TORRENT ROARS through the forest

Gordy and the others reach the near bank where the path
drops into the water to reappear on the opposite bank
The Man in the Yankees Cap is in the lead He plunges
into the fast water up to his waist Gordy and the rest
splash in behind struggling to cross against the swift
current The Man in the Yankees Cap reaches the far
bank Takes two steps and

EXPLOSION 113

BOOM An EXPLOSION rips into him

GORDY AND OTHERS 114

stop mid-stream but one of the group a young woman
believing the blast was caused by the pursuing military
continues struggling to cross An OLDER MAN looks sees
the blast-hole

OLDER MAN
Mina
Gordy realizes the old mans saying land mine To the
young woman --
GORDY
No
Gordy moves to catch her Just manages to stop her as
she reaches the far bank Gordy points to where the land
mine detonated
GORDY

Mina Mina

Beat Slowly the terrified young woman responds to the
strong calm tone of command in Gordys voice and the
unpanicked reassuring look on his face

Gordy brings her back to the group which fights to stand
in the rushing river He indicates for them to hold
hands for stability Motions for them to stay

GORDY
Alto

GORDY 115

leaves the group in the middle of the river The GUNFIRE

is now FAR-OFF AND SPORADIC He crosses to the waters

edge on the far bank Pulls the Zippo from his pack and

leans over Uses the flame to illuminate the mud and

rock immediately in front of him Scratches lightly at

the ground with the machete searching for mines Finds nothing
in that spot And steps onto it

Searching the ground and scratching at it with the
machete before each step Gordy inches toward the Man in
the Yankees Cap Three steps from the river

He finds a small round anti-personnel mine the size of a
hockey puck He inches past it Moves past another
And another To the writhing Man in the Yankees Cap --

GORDY
Dont move Dont move

NEW ANGLE

Finally Gordy reaches him One of the mans legs is
missing below the knee Hes bleeding from various other
wounds as well Gordy uses the Zippo to inspect the area
for more mines Then kneels in a footprint

GORDY
Youll be okay Youll be okay

He takes a bandanna from the man and ties a tourniquet
around his thigh By way of distracting him --

GORDY
Guerrilla bastards

MAN IN YANKEES CAP

No Military To stop
guerrillas
Beat Gordy finishes the tourniquet when he sees

YOUNG MAN

has left the group and emerged from the river in a
different place to avoid the mines

Gordys eyes go to something glistening in front of the
young man -- a taut nylon line ten inches off the ground

The kids about to hit it Gordy shouts --

GORDY
No Alto

The young man hears the alarm in Gordys voice and
stops But not before he plants his next step and

The trip wire bows against his shin and

Gordy ducks covers the Man in the Yankees Cap and

Nothing happens The young man just stands there frozen
in position his leg still bowing the line

Using the Zippo again to light his way Gordy advances to
the young man He follows the trip wire to where a Coca-
Cola can hangs from a nearby tree On closer inspection
Gordy can see the can is sleeved around a grenade
Theres no pin in the grenade The can keeps the
grenades arming spoon in place The trip wires
designed to yank the can off allowing the grenade to
explode at chest level And the cans almost off
Gordy burns through the monofilament trip wire Then
carefully slides the Coke can back over the grenade

MAN IN YANKEES CAP - MOMENTS LATER

When Gordy returns the mans dead OFF Gordy looking
down at the NY logo on the cap

EXTINT ANOTHER CHIVA - DAY

Gordy sees a sign for a town as the chiva rumbles along

He pulls out his map

INSERT - MAP

Gordy finds the town which lies along a river He
traces a road from the town The road runs south through
the town of Mompos and eventually reaches Caguan the
ELC capital

BACK TO SCENE

A COLOMBIAN WOMAN is looking over Gordys shoulder

Two plainclothes federales have been watching the ferry
load and now relax their vigil One man holds a Xerox of
Gordys passport photo The other bites into an
empanada which breaks open and spills its contents down
the front of his shirt His partner finds it funny He
doesnt And while their attentions occupied

Gordy hurries by oblivious to the federales presence
and just manages to hop onto the ferry as it pulls away

Armstrong carefully returns the card to the hat And now
his voice takes on a noticeably more measured tone --

Gordy

Beat Gordys contemplating the warning when his eyes
go to a small sleepy boy standing nearby on the cramped
deck leaning against his father Gordy reaches over and
taps the boy The boy looks over Shrinks away at the
sight of the large gringo The father notices and looks
at Gordy who stands indicates his seat

GORDY
Por favor

The fathers also apprehensive doesnt move

GORDY
Con mucho gusto

Finally the father accepts sits down with the sleepy
boy on his lap Nods his thanks at Gordy who then gazes
down at the son A kid about Matts age Armstrong
recognizes the look of a caring dad

extends his AK-47 Prods a hump of greenery with the
rifle butt and in a flash

The greenery suddenly transforms into two men wearing

truck and watch the ferry pass

ARMSTRONG
Sicarios Death squads Avoid

SAME SCENE - FEW MOMENTS LATER 128

The ferry pulls up to the dock The dock street is a
culture clash of shanty bars and Amazon Indian traders
of big-wheel SUVs and mule carts Theres a definite air
of menace

ARMSTRONG
Federales are looking for someone

Gordy follows Armstrongs look to two plain-clothes
federales one fat and one thin standing near the dock
watching the boat pull up

When Gordy glances back Armstrong is gone

EXT MOMPOS FERRY DOCK - DAY 129

Gordy disembarks amid the throng of passengers when the
FAT FEDERALE confronts him

FAT FEDERALE
Senor Pitt

Gordy looks up in surprise at him and the thin federale
backing him up

FAT FEDERALE
Youll have to come with us

GORDY
Why

FAT FEDERALE
Come with us please

He clamps a hand on Gordys arm Gordy shakes it off and
starts running Almost immediately hes tackled to the
ground by the thin federale Two more federales join in

Gordys not gonna go down easy though
Even as only one against four Gordys a formidable

challenge Hes strong and hes committed all the way
Hes not getting kicked out of this country again Its
not a clean or artful fight Theres no karate Its
four men trying to tackle a bull and

The bull gets away

134 GORDY

runs jumps launches off a beer keg and

135 TOP OF WALL

He reaches the top of the wall and pulls himself up
Hes looking out across a block-long run of corrugated
tin roofs Takes off across the roofs each step
thundering as

136 FEDERALES

burst into the courtyard Two men hastily build a stack
of boxes etc against the wall

GORDY

runs as fast as he can across the rooftops when

A section of roof gives way beneath his feet just as

NEW ANGLE

One of the federales finally mounts the wall looks
across the rooftops and Gordys gone

GORDY

lands inside a warehouse room amid sacks of rice beans
and coffee The building is dark and dusty He lies
still and listens FOOTSTEPS approach across the tin
roof overhead Gordy burrows into the bags of rice
pulls them over him

FEDERALE

on the roof peers down through the hole Scans the
warehouse room below with a mini-Mag-Lite

GORDY

sees the flashlight beam move past He holds his breath
Beat Then the FOOTSTEPS pass on RECEDE down the roof
And Gordy can breathe again

EXT MOMPOS STREET - NIGHT

Gordy makes his way along the main drag of the frontier
town A noisy neon-lit strip of bars and brothels
Everyones packing a gun A new Dodge City where death
squad sicarios cruise past in 4x4s BLARING SALSA

INT TROPICALE - NIGHT

In here the MUSICS LOUD ROCK N ROLL Gringo music
for a gringo bar The place is busy with plenty of

local hostesses for the men Even Armstrong standing
half-crocked at the bar is flanked by two scantily-clad
women Hes got a spoon hanging off his nose So does one
of the girls Armstrongs trying to hang a spoon on the
other

Gordy slips into the bar Spots Armstrong through the
crowd Sees Armstrongs not wearing his cap when

The girl with the spoon on her nose turns slightly
revealing shes wearing the cap Its on backwards but
now Gordy can see the Deerborn logo clearly

Gordy wants the guerrilla travel pass inside the cap
Its a desperate move but hes got no choice Starts
toward the girl when

Gordy sees the thin federale enter the front door The
thin federale sees him at the same time Begins moving
in on him

Gordy moves faster toward the girl And
The girl unwittingly does him a favor by taking off the
cap and setting it on the bar where its easier to grab
and then turns her attention to Armstrongs antics
The thin detective fights through the crowd after Gordy
Gordys almost to the hat

( )

Armstrongs still having trouble with the second girls
spoon

ARMSTRONG
I never met a nose I couldnt hang
a spoon on

Gordy reaches the bar snags the cap Glances back sees
the thin federale closing in turns to run out the back

when

A strong hand stops him The hand belongs to the Fat
Federale And now the thin federales there too
wielding a stun gun where Gordy can see it People in
the bar fall silent Everyone but Armstrong whos
finally hung the spoon on the second girls nose

ARMSTRONG
Yahtzee

And now Armstong also realizes somethings up Turns and
sees Gordy Sees the cap in Gordys hand as the Fat
Federale addresses Gordy --

FAT FEDERALE
Come along Mr Pitt

Whereupon Armstrong shouts drunkenly at Gordy --
ARMSTRONG
Police catch you trying to steal
my hat you asshole

He staggers toward Gordy Grabs the hat

ARMSTRONG
Fucking hat thief

Armstrong takes a drunken swing at Gordy but
Instead of hitting Gordy Armstrong accidentally-on-
purpose clocks the fat detective Then hisses into

Gordys ear clearly not that drunk --

ARMSTRONG
Get outta here --

But then Armstrongs legs wont work as the thin federale
jams the stun gun against his neck and 10000 volts
surprise the Armstrong neural network

Gordy moves against the thin federale in anger when

The Fat Federale ZAPS him with another STUN GUN just
behind the ear And Gordy gets to know the floor too

EXT MOMPOS JAIL - NIGHT

The buildings ancient constructed of wood and adobe

INT MOMPOS JAIL - CELL - NIGHT

The jail might be old but the cells are secure enough
Theyre also unsanitary and thoroughly unpleasant

Gordy and Armstrong are led in by the federales The Fat
Federale has Armstrongs hat He looks it over
wondering why Gordy wanted it Then decides he could
give a fuck and tosses it to Armstrong Clangs the cell
door shut and locks it Leaves shaking his head

FAT FEDERALE

Armstrongs still unsteady on his feet and sits down on
the metal bunk

ARMSTRONG

guerrillas surprised earlier by the heavy-camouflaged
infiltrators The federales are armed with batons and
stun guns taking no chances Its clear the rebels
werent brought here without a struggle either -- both
are cut and bruised The tougher-looking of the two has
taken a real beating This beaten man is jammed face-
first against the bars of Gordys cell He makes eye
contact with Gordy while the other rebel is unbound and
put into a cell Then the beaten man is shoved into the
cell A solid brick wall separates them from Gordy and
Armstrong Armstrongs seen the patches on their
uniforms To Gordy sotto --

of a warning --

Matt He looks at it for a few moments Then pockets it
again

SAME SCENE - LATER

The panga passes a dead body floating downstream

SAME SCENE - LATER

The panga passes revolutionary banners and signs lining
the riverbank
BOATMAN
La zona guerrillera

SAME SCENE - MOMENTS LATER

The panga rounds a bend and

Two souped-up bass boats filled with heavily-armed ELC

guerrillas move to intercept it

The Boatman slows puts the panga in neutral and keeps
his hands in sight

One boat of guerrillas pulls alongside The other sheers
off and stops a short distance away ready to open fire

Gordy shows the guerrillas his travel pass One of them
takes it Reads Looks Gordy over Then starts to rip

the pass in half when

He stops Grins Its a big joke He hands back the
pass searches the boat quickly and waves the panga on

EXT CAGUAN TOWN DOCK - DAY

The panga arrives and Gordy gets out Hes met by
FELIX Felix has a 9mm in a shoulder holster Felix
doesnt look the least bit happy

FELIX

GORDY
Yeah

FELIX

Come with me
Felix leads him towards a Land Cruiser

FELIX
Armstrong should have called
sooner We dont like changes

here If I didnt need the
equipment fixed Id send you
back

They reach the Land Cruiser

FELIX

But now we have to see the ELC

Supervisor for Caguan

Its a prospect that seems to concern Felix almost as
much as Gordy Off which as they get into the Toyota

INT ELC SUPERVISORS OFFICE - DAY

The ELC SUPERVISOR for Caguan may be a Marxist but the

clean

well-ordered office is nicely appointed with a

big-screen Sony and leather furniture The TVs TUNED TO
CNN A photo on the wall depicts him as a younger man
wearing guerrilla cammies bearing with an ELC patch and
holding an AK-47 A brass nameplate reading Supervisor
rests on a neat desk behind which stands the man himself
-- a hardened former guerrilla fighter proud of his

position

Hes not in cammies now -- his uniform now

consists of casual but nice tropical clothing and a fat

Rolex

Felix is a subordinate here He and Gordy stand across
the desk as the Supervisor examines Gordys travel pass
Gordys nervous about what could appear on the TV in the

bg

but tries not to show it

ELC SUPERVISOR
Your passport was stolen

GORDY
In Mompos

ELC SUPERVISOR
Mompos is a shithole Not
like Caguan Why didnt
Armstrong come

GORDY
He was arrested in Ecuador He
got drunk and fooled around with a
police officers wife

The Supervisor just looks at him assessing Gordys face
for signs hes lying Gordys expression stays the same

Felix respectfully interjects Its almost a plea

FELIX
(in Spanish)
We need to fix the equipment We

have delivery deadlines to meet
( )

A long beat The ELC Supervisor hands the travel pass
back to Gordy In a hard tone to Felix --

ELC SUPERVISOR
(in Spanish)
Hes your responsibility Dont
let him out of your sight

Si Gracias

As Felix leads Gordy away

INTEXT LAND CRUISER (CAGUAN) - DAY

Gordy and Felix pull away from the Supervisors HQ
Felix resumes his former tone of command

FELIX
The Supervisor made you my
responsibility You dont go
anywhere without me you
understand

GORDY
No problemo

Gordy peers out the window intently as they drive
looking for a lucky break looking for The Wolf
searching the face of every man He doesnt see The
Wolf but what he does see surprises him The ELC
Supervisor was right Caguans no Mompos Its a third-
world town armed troops are visible and theres a lot
of bad shit behind Colombias revolutionaries but here
the streets are calm and orderly Its quiet almost
eerie as people go about their business OFF Gordy
seeing another side of the guerrillas

INTEXT LAND CRUISERCOUNTRY ROAD - DAY

Felix turns off at the entrance to a lane leading to the
plantation The entrance is guarded by a 4X4 Rat
Patrol assault truck and four heavily armed ELC
guerrillas

GORDY
The ELC guards your coffee
beans

Felix thinks hes joking Until he looks over and sees
Gordys actually being sincere

( )

FELIX
Coffee beans Shit
Armstrong didnt tell you much
INTEXT LAND CRUISER - PLANTATION - DAY 180
They approach a hacienda and outbuildings The
accoutrements of agriculture are present -- tractors
sheds cats etc -- but clearly this is no family farm

There are lots of serious-looking men around More ELC
guerrillas stand guard

FELIX 181

stops the car He and Gordy get out Felix begins
leading Gordy toward two rows of long open-walled sheds

FELIX
The problems with the diesel
generators The sons-of-bitches
keep breaking down

NEW ANGLE 182

They pass four very large pits where green leaves steep
in a thick foul-smelling liquid

FELIX
Were using portables to keep
production going but they dont
supply enough power to the heat
lamps and we have to dry a lot
of coffee beans

183 ANOTHER ANGLE 183

Theyre now walking between the two rows of sheds where
portable gas GENERATORS THRUM and

Gordy can see long wide platforms inside Above the
platforms are multiple arrays of powerful heat lamps
Spread out and drying beneath them is a half-acre or two
of converted cocaine

184 IN ANOTHER SHED 184

workers pack and wrap one-kilo bricks of coke for
shipment

approach the two giant diesel generators

FELIX
We can fix anything but these
keep dying on us Youll start
now Ill have tools brought to

you

(beat)
Armstrongs a magician with them
Lets hope you have his skill

Felix walks over to a guerrilla with an AK-47 and speaks
to him Then goes Whereupon the guerrilla crosses to
Gordy and takes up a sentry position over him

186 SAME SCENE - LATER

Gordy has the diesels partially dismantled The
guerrilla sentry is still right there Felix returns

FELIX
Well

Gordy has to think of something fast Beat He throws a

machine part against a wall angrily

GORDY
I cant work with these pieces of
junk
FELIX
Junk These generators cost a
fortune
GORDY

Then treat them that way

FELIX
(beat then)
Armstrong always fixes them

GORDY
Armstrong wants your money He
makes them work but he doesnt
fix them To do this right we
gotta order parts from Europe
In the meantime I can make
something temporary There must
be a machine shop in town

FELIX
Yes

Gordy stands

GORDY
Lets go

look for The Wolf Its a long-shot and he knows it
But its all he can do

EMPTY STOREFRONT

They pass an empty storefront A sign on the large
front plate glass window says Cine and Sabado

They pass a bar Felix watches it go by with something
like a look of desire Gordy registers the look and the
connection to the bar

INT MACHINE SHOP - VARIOUS SHOTS - DAY

Gordy selects spare parts

A clerk wraps the parts in an old newspaper and

Gordy realizes his picture is on the paper He smears
grease from his hands over it

EXT MACHINE SHOP - DAY

Gordy finishes loading the parts into the Land Cruiser

FELIX
Lets get moving

GORDY

FELIX
We have to get back

Felix really

GORDY
Tell me what doesnt get you

Gordy takes a swig of beer When

Gordy sees the Beaten Man from the jail in Mompos The
man has just walked in with another guerrilla

Gordy barely avoids being seen as the guerrillas cross
the room At the bar the bartender puts out two crates
of beer The guerrillas take the beer and head out No
moneys changed hands When theyre gone to Felix --

GORDY
Wed better get back huh

FELIX
(checks his watch)
Shit Its late

EXT BAR - NIGHT

The two guerrillas are just driving away in a big-
wheeled high ground-clearance Suburban as Gordy and
Felix emerge Felix is weaving

Gordy keeps his eyes on the Suburbans tail lights and
opens the Land Cruisers passenger door for Felix

GORDY
Youre too drunk Ill drive

EXTINT LAND CRUISER

Gordy gets in Felix hands Gordy the keys Then slumps
against his door and closes his eyes

FELIX

Gordy follows the Suburban as Felix rambles --

FELIX
Ill take her to a small
restaurant Well have lobster
and drink lots of wine Ill get
her drunk Well drive home
Ill carry her inside Ill kiss
her And then Ill screw her in
my bed

The Suburban pulls up next to a house There are armed
guerrilla guards outside

FELIX
And when I am done screwing
her shell never want to look at
another man again

Gordy drives past the house as the Beaten Man and the
guerrilla with him get out of the Suburban and start
carrying the beer inside And a moment later

Felix comes around with a start

FELIX
What the fuck are you doing

He unholsters the 9mm and points it at Gordy

GORDY
Hey easy Whats the problem

FELIX
Youre going the wrong goddamn
way
GORDY
I am Looks different in the
dark
FELIX
Turn around
Gordy turns the car around Felix keeps the gun on him
FELIX
You drive where I say Or the

Supervisor will have us both shot

Gordy drives back They approach the Suburban and the
house once more This time its on Felix side Felix
gives the guerrilla guards a wave as they go by and
Gordys eyes go to something he couldnt see coming the
other way a large propane tank next to the house

The suns over the yardarm now blazing hot and Gordys
still working under the watchful eyes of the guards

Nearby a group of guerrillas is playing soccer when

A man is injured and his teammates call for one of
Gordys guards to substitute The man in the combat vest
responds The game is shirts and skins and hes joining
the skins Puts down his AK strips off his combat vest
and shirt and runs in

Gordys eyes go to the vest and the attached grenades
With the other guard still watching him closely however
theres nothing Gordy can do

SAME SCENE - LATER

The soccer game rages back and forth Suddenly an open
man gets the ball Breaks toward the goal

Gordy sees the player about to go one-on-one with the
goalie He cheers the action loudly whereupon

Gordys guard turns to see whats happening and

Gordy grabs a grenade Almost gets it into a tool box
when

The player kicks wide the guard looks back and

Gordy covers the clattering of the grenades dropping
into the tool box by picking up a large wrench But the
grenades still visible as now

Felix comes around the corner Hes sleepy and hungover
And pissed by Gordys lack of progress

FELIX
Its afternoon Yesterday you
said it would only take two more
hours

Gordy wipes his hands on a rag throws it on the grenade

GORDY
I have this one ready to go

Gordy reaches up and hits the start button on the
GENERATOR It SPUTTERS but wont catch Felix just
looks at him Gordy makes an adjustment and

This time the ENGINE TURNS OVER PURRS like new The
heat lamps brighten in a row of sheds Felix winces as
the DIESEL ROAR makes the hangover hammers in his head
pound even harder

FELIX
What about the other one

GORDY
I just need another part from
town and its five more minutes

FELIX
Shit Fine Lets go
Gordy grabs the tool box

Gordy drops out the bathroom window

EXTINT LAND CRUISER - MOMENTS LATER

Gordy gets the grenade from the tool box He slides it
just inside the top of his pants with the spoon hooked
over the waistband He finds some wire Then searches
for something else Finds a piece of string and checks
its length From Gordys reaction we understand its
too short

Gordy opens doors and checks seat pockets Nothing He
checks the glove box No long string there either But
he does find two rubber bands Gordy studies them a
moment thinking Tests their elasticity Then pulls
out the Zippo and thumbs it The lighter still works

As Gordy pockets everything and walks off

EXT CAGUAN - VARIOUS SHOTS - NIGHT

Gordy steals through town hiding when he sees someone
coming Hes re-tracing the route he took the night
before when he followed the Beaten Mans Suburban

CINE

He passes the Cine in the storefront A movies
beginning to play on the supervisors big-screen TV
place is packed No one sees Gordy who moves on

GORDY

continues to make his way through Caguan when

He rounds a corner and theres a four-man ELC patrol
two in a truck and two out Gordy turns starts heading
back when

One of the GUERRILLAS calls to him

GUERRILLA

The

Alto

Gordy stops The two standing men walk toward him The
other two men get out of the truck to provide backup

One guerrilla approaching Gordy stops short and stands
off cocked-and-locked as the other comes up Gordy
carefully produces the travel pass The guerrilla looks
it over In butchered Spanish --

GORDY
Yo trabajo con Felix Felix --
(indicates)
-- la cantina Con Berta

The attractive woman we saw earlier playing with the
children now walks up holding the hand of a small boy A
guerrilla waves them on The woman and boy hustle by
glancing at the face of this big gringo in trouble as

they pass They hurry on toward the nearby Cine

OFF Gordy as the guerrilla indicates for him to start
walking to the truck

INT BAR - NIGHT

The guerrilla patrol has taken Gordy to Felix still
sitting with Berta in his lap

FELIX
Are you trying to get us both
killed

GORDY

I went for a walk I figured you
wanted to be alone with Berta

FELIX

in Spanish)
Ill make sure hes on a shorter

leash

The patrol leader looks at Felix hard Then nods The

guerrillas go Felix dumps Berta onto her feet stands
Felix looks at Gordy shakes his head

Gordy looks down sees the spoon of the grenade exposed
As he readjusts his shirt to cover the spoon

EXT PLANTATION - DIESEL GENERATORS - NIGHT 215

Felix is right there supervising for himself as Gordy
finishes working Gordy stands He stares hopefully at
the MACHINE Then pushes the starter and VRROOM
The heat lights in the second row of sheds brighten

Gordy turns to Felix

GORDY
That make you happy

No response

GORDY
Wheres my money

FELIX
Youll get it in the morning

INT HACIENDA - STOREROOM - NIGHT
Felix yanks the dangling cord and turns on the lights

The rooms a mess All kinds of rubbish Theres a
washtub sink Theres a cot

GORDY
This where Armstrong stays

FELIX
This is where you stay A boat
will take you down river at seven

Felix closes the door We hear a LOCK TURNING Gordy
moves to the door and tries it Its definitely locked
Through a small window he can see the lights in the
sheds and the ever-vigilant nighttime ELC sentries
patrolling the grounds The DIESELS ROAR in the bg

Gordy turns back Readjusts the grenade digging into his
belly then hooks it back inside his pants He turns off
the light Moves to the adobe wall opposite the door
THROUGH another small window he can see its dark in
this direction

Gordy rummages through the refuse lying around the room
We see some rubber tubing We see some rope Gordy
finally finds a piece of sharp metal He moves to the
wall with the window With the DIESELS covering the
noise Gordy starts chiseling away at the adobe

EXT PLANTATION - NIGHT

The big-wheeled guerrilla Suburban drives in

INT STOREROOM

Gordy is making slow progress through the wall when he
hears the VEHICLE arrive He moves to the window by the
door and looks out Sees the Suburban Four guerrillas

are getting out including the Beaten Man Felix meets

them The Beaten Man exchanges words with Felix Felix

indicates Gordys room As the Beaten Man continues to

question Felix

Gordy realizes hes fucked He cant get through the
wall fast enough His eyes go to water dripping from a
pipe leading to the washtub sink He moves to it Finds
the water pipe underneath that feeds the tap Cranks
shut the master valve on the pipe Wraps his hands
around the pipe and pulls Nothing Jams his feet
against the wall for leverage and pulls harder And
this time he yanks the pipe free from the sink He
finds the rubber hose Fits an end over the pipe

Quickly lashes it on with some wire Then cranks on the
master valve High-pressure water streams from the hose

Gordy sneaks a peek out the window The Beaten Mans
still questioning Felix The sound of the hose water is
being covered by the DIESELS

Gordy crosses the room extending the hose to the hole
hes made in the wall He aims the stream at the hole
Thumbs the end of the hose to make the water jet even
harder And watches the jet begin eating away at the
old adobe and brick just as it ate through the crumbling
plaster in the Spanish Harlem tenement

EXT PLANTATION

The Beaten Man finishes with Felix Felix begins leading
the guerrillas toward the storeroom

INT STOREROOM

Gordys made progress but hasnt broken through yet
And he wont not in enough time Under his breath --

GORDY
Come on baby come on baby

And just then

EXT PLANTATION

WHAM-WHAM-WHAM one of the DIESELS Gordy repaired suffers
a spectacularly loud internal breakdown The heat lights
dim in a row of sheds Felix and the guerrillas stop to
see whats happening At which point the generator now
BURSTS into FLAMES

BACK TO GORDY

He smiles

GORDY
Just in time

And we realize that hed planned on the diversion as

The water jet breaks through The holes still small
Gordy begins to widen it

EXT PLANTATION

Felix the Beaten Man and the other guerrillas resume
their march toward the storeroom

They reach the storeroom Waters pouring out under the
door Felix unlocks the door and opens it to find

INT STOREROOM

Gordys gone The Beaten Man signals two men to go out
the hole To the other man --

BEATEN MAN
(in Spanish)
Organize the others Find him

The man goes Outside we hear him SHOUT orders to the
guerrillas guarding the plantation The Beaten Man turns
to Felix Felix is terrified In a pleading tone --

FELIX
(in Spanish)
He cant be far Youll catch --
BANG The Beaten Man SHOOTS Felix in the head Then

exits OFF Felix dead his blood mixing with the water
still streaming across the floor

EXT PLANTATION - MOMENTS LATER

The guerrillas report to the Beaten Man They cant find

Gordy To the men guarding the plantation --

BEATEN MAN
(in Spanish)
Keep looking

He signals his men to come with him They get into the
Suburban Whereupon we FIND

UNDER SUBURBAN

Gordys hanging onto the chassis With the large tires
and high ground-clearance theres just enough room to
get his legs over the rear axle Hes just finishing
rigging up a rope he took from the store room -- the
ropes slung from one side of the chassis to the other
to support Gordys back He hears the ENGINE START
grabs the transfer case and

SUBURBAN 227
ROARS off with Gordy suspended below
The rear DRIVE SHAFT WHIRS madly inches from Gordys
face And with each bump in the road even with heavy-
duty off-road shocks and springs the undercarriage of
the Suburban comes within inches of crushing Gordys
legs ROCKS are PINGING everywhere The dirt and the
dust are choking Even for a short distance its going
to be a long dangerous ride
EXT SUBURBAN (CAGUAN) - NIGHT 228
As the TRUCK BLASTS down back roads and through the
darkened town
GORDY 229

continues to suffer underneath Even with the rope
supporting him he has to hold on with two hands

A vicious jolt suddenly loosens a grenade It starts to
slip free Gordy cant stop it without letting go The

grenade falls and

Gordy shoots out a hand and grabs it Barely The spoon

just hanging on the end of his fingertips Gordy cant
use his other hand to get it He needs the hand to hold
onto the car The grenade begins to slip Hes going to
lose it And just as it falls

Gordy does the only thing left He slips a finger
through the loops of the grenade pin Just barely snags
the grenade before it drops to the road And then

Carefully slowly -- praying that each bump doesnt jar
the grenade off the pin -- with his other arm shaking and
screaming in pain as he maintains a grip on the transfer
case -- Gordy eases the grenade back onto his stomach
where he gets a better grip Jams the grenade back

Then grabs onto the undercarriage once more in time to
relieve the muscle-tearing strain on his arm

ABOVE GORDYS WORLD

the Suburban passes the Cine The movies over just
letting out

EXT GUERRILLA HOUSE - NIGHT

The Suburban pulls up to the well-guarded house Gordy saw
the night before The men get out and go inside leaving
the SUBURBAN RUNNING clearly planning to leave again
right away

GORDY

carefully lowers himself to the ground Slides out on
the side away from the house Hides behind a large
wheel The brightly-lit house is surrounded by coconut
trees Gordy watches the guards When the guards arent
looking he runs to the nearest tree The sounds of the
SUBURBANS ENGINE covers his footsteps

TREES

Gordy moves from tree to tree when the guards arent
looking when he reaches one tree and

NEW ANGLE

THUNK A coconut hits the ground next to him and
One of the guards comes to investigate

The guard gets closer Gordy inches around the tree He
cant get away without being seen He nudges the coconut
with his toe Nudges it harder causing it slowly to
roll away and

The guard picks it up Never sees Gordy in the shadow of

the tree pressed against the trunk The guard shows the
coconut to a guard near the house then walks back

GORDY

sneaks to another tree Then reaches the house He
moves to a window Peers into a room No ones there
But we hear the sound of VOICES Gordy creeps along the
wall Looks into another room and

INSIDE

is a group of ELC guerrillas including the Beaten Man
packing suitcases etc Leaving in a hurry

GORDY

scans the faces Except for the Beaten Man no face is
familiar A man with his BACK TO us stands and theres
nothing familiar about him either When

ANOTHER ANGLE

Directly in front of us another man emerges from a room
Hes also in ELC guerrilla camo

CLOSE ON MAN (PRESENT)

in the room Its the same face

BACK TO GORDY
Hes found The Wolf when
Suddenly a guard appears and

Gordy freezes Eases into the shadows His dirty face
and clothes blend in just enough The guard moves past

ANOTHER ANGLE

When the coast is clear Gordy moves to the large propane
tank He takes out the grenade Puts the rubber bands
around it spoon and all Grips the grenade in his hand
holding the spoon down and yanks the pin And then

Slowly slowly Gordy begins releasing his grip allowing
the rubber bands to take on the pressure of the spring-
loaded spoon If theyll do it if the spoon goes now
Gordys going up in the blast

Gordy continues to relax his grip The rubber bands
stretch Stretch more Keep stretching until theyre
barely holding the spoon but theyre holding it

Gordy quickly carefully wires the grenade to the propane
tank Then takes out the Zippo pulls it apart and
removes the lighter fluid-soaked cotton Holds the
cotton just above the grenade and squeezes with his

fingers And

Lighter fluid drops onto the rubber bands Gordy
squeezes out as much as he can onto them
Then Gordy gets the hell out of there He finds cover

Ducks down And waits

CLOSEUP - GRENADE

The lighter fluid is dissolving the rubber bands

BACK TO SCENE

Gordy suddenly hears a womans gentle SINGING He looks
in the direction of the sound and

Gordy sees the attractive Woman and the boy approaching
on the road Shes singing a gentle song in Spanish
Gordys eyes flash with alarm He glances at the house

CLOSEUP - GRENADE

The lighter fluid continues dissolving the rubber bands
which are now beginning to lose their elasticity and
stretch from the pressure of the spoon

Gordy looks back at the Woman and boy closer now
walking toward the house

A vicious kick in the ribs lifts Gordy off the ground
rolling him away from the Woman and child
THE WOLF
You bastard

The Wolfs alive and unhurt Angrily punts Gordy again

THE WOLF
You think you can kill The Wolf

A boot in the face this time

THE WOLF
You think you can kill The Wolf

A piece of paper has fallen from one of Gordys pockets
and fluttered to the ground nearby The woman picks it
up and we see

Its the photo of Anne and Matt
The woman stares at the photo a moment as
Gordy absorbs another blow He tries to stand

GORDY
You killed my wife and son --

Whack The Wolf slams the butt of an AK-47 against
Gordys skull Gordy drops hard The Wolf reverses the
AK Points it at Gordys head about to pull the
trigger when

The Woman lays a hand on The Wolfs arm

WOMAN
Claudio

The Wolf doesnt take his eyes off Gordy The Woman
squeezes his arm Implores him --

WOMAN
Claudio

261

The Wolf glances over Meets her eyes a moment Sees
the photo in her hand Glances up into her eyes again
They hold the look A whole conversation exchanged

without words Then The Wolf turns back to Gordy lying
in a pile on the ground Beat To Gordy --

THE WOLF
You were just saved by your
guardian angel

INT UNDERGROUND BUNKER - DAY

Dark and dank Excavated clay walls and floor Heavy
door A bare overhead bulb provides some light

Gordy lies on a metal bed frame One of his legs is
chained to the bed Hes in pain from being kicked --
but the physical aches are nothing compared to the
anguish he feels for having failed

The doors unlocked and opens Daylight streams in from
above as The Wolf enters with two guerrilla bodyguards
He moves to the middle of the room Looks at Gordy

THE WOLF
One of the men in the jail with
you in Mompos is dying He was
burned in your explosion

Gordy just looks at him

The Wolf signals a bodyguard who crosses to Gordy and
frees his leg from the chain

THE WOLF
You want to kill me Come and
kill me

The bodyguards are smiling Gordy hesitates then
springs for The Wolf and

The Wolf immediately fells him with a choppy-looking
karate combination The Wolfs no Jet Li -- his styles
a throwback even ugly but its well-practiced and
brutally effective Even still Gordy springs back right
away and The Wolf drops him again

THE WOLF
You Americans think you have all
the answers And really youre
so naive

Gordy comes up swinging Gordys a barroom fighter If
he can touch you youre in trouble He never gets
close A vicious front kick folds him and a fist drives
him to the floor The Wolf stands over him

THE WOLF
You see one peasant with a
gun and you never ask why he has
to have it You just run to give
your billions to the nearest
soldiers no matter how merciless
or corrupt they are

The last kick really hurt Gordy Hes slow rising

THE WOLF
Thats why Im teaching America a
lesson thats why therell be
more bombs and more families
like yours will pay the price

The Wolf wants to pique him but this is pouring gasoline
onto fire Gordy explodes off the ground The

suddenness and fury of the rush catch The Wolf off guard
Gordy drives him backward Slams him against a wall

Then hooks an arm around the back of The Wolfs neck and
drives the other fist like a piston into his abdomen

All his weight behind the punches Trying to break ribs
and crush them into The Wolfs heart when

A bodyguard slams the butt of an AK into Gordys kidneys
Gordy takes the blow standing The guard delivers a
second much harder shot and Gordy drops to his knees in
agony Beat The Wolf recovers from the hammer-blows to
his midsection And then

He makes Gordy pay for the punches Lands blow after
blow on Gordys face Beats the living shit out of
him and leaves him unconscious on the dirt floor

we hear a gentle CLACKING sound Its unidentifiable

GORDYS POV

The black becomes a BLUR The BLUR becomes a hazy
glimpse of Selena Shes sitting on the metal bed frame

screams Swipes at him with the digging tool making
three deep scratches in his face Gordy doesnt stop

401 OMITTED

402 EXT TOWN HOUSE - ROOFADJOINING ROOFTOPS

This is where the woman was gardening tending a rooftop
flower bed Selena emerges crushes plants as she runs
to the next town house roof

Gordy hits the roof behind her

403 SELENA

As Selena runs from rooftop to rooftop along the row of

town houses we see her warrior determination and

discipline Shes thinking ahead and she never

hesitates Her big problem is shes being pursued by an equally

405A
405A

well-trained and determined firefighter And
hes not far back One tumble and hell catch her
Selena strains harder

SELENA

vaults a gap Moments later Gordy vaults it

SELENA

finally runs out of roof She looks down A fire escape
ladder leads down to an interior ground-level courtyard
of a small foreign embassy Still holding the crowbar
Selena takes the ladder down

MOMENTS LATER

Gordy reaches the ladder Selenas ahead of him by a
floor hurrying down two rungs at a time Gordy doesnt
fuck with the rungs Just swings over the edge of the
roof grabs the side-rails lightly with his hands
squeezes the rails with the insides of his boots and lets
gravity take over

EXT EMBASSY - COURTYARD

The fire escape leads down to a second-story balcony
running around the inside wall of the courtyard Twin
staircases lead from the balcony to ground level where
across the slate-paved car court a wrought-iron gate
opens onto the street

Gordy hits the balcony a half-second after Selena He
grabs her Selena swings the crowbar to break his arm
Gordy has to let go Selena heads for the stairs leading
to the ground

GORDY S

got one chance to intercept Selena The balconys too
high for him to jump but the courtyards ringed with
trees -- theyre not close but theyre not far either

Not for a man craving revenge for the deaths of his wife
and son a man who also slides down fire poles for a
living

Gordy runs down the balcony Gains speed Jumps
Launches off the balcony railing And hurtles himself at
the trunk of a medium-sized tree He hits the trunk
Hangs on And slides to the ground And now

ANOTHER ANGLE

Hes between Selena and the only way out And theres no
way shes getting past him

But thats not what Selenas thinking She attacks with
the crowbar and Gordy can only retreat in the face of
the vicious onslaught He finds a nearby garbage can
Its full heavy but he manages to lift it spilling
garbage as he uses the can to block the blows from the
crowbar The CROWBAR THWOCKS into the can over and over
the sound ECHOING LOUDLY in the small courtyard

Selena swings again and Gordy moves to block the hit
Its a feint She swings under the can and hits a leg
It hurts like hell he stumbles but he stays on his

feet still holding the can Selena goes for his head

Gordy raises the can Thwock Thwock The cans all
dents Theres garbage everywhere She feints high and
then swings low again a wicked blow to the knee Gordy
stumbles badly this time Selena breaks for the gate
Gordy sees her and with all his might slings the can
across the slate pavers and

The can takes Selenas legs out from under her She
falls hard Gets back to her feet quickly and starts to
run when

Gordy hits her like a linebacker Slams Selena against a
brick wall Gets behind her and slips a mighty arm
around her thin neck Selena squirms hard kicks
backward going for the balls kneecaps insteps doing
whatever she can to hurt Gordy and get free But shes

not in a position to do a lot of damage -- and shed have
to kill him before hed let go

Gordys got his arm locked in a police chokehold around
Selenas neck Uses his weight to force the smaller
woman down onto her knees Presses her harder till
shes sitting back on her legs Selena cant drop out of
the hold and her legs are immobilized All she can do
is scratch But Gordys oblivious Theyre alone in the
courtyard Body to body Head to head Hes pumped

with fury and hatred He tightens the chokehold Hisses
in her ear --

GORDY
You killed them

SELENA
(beat with
contempt)
One woman one boy -- they mean
nothing next to the thousands
whove been slain

Gordy hears it It only drives him to a deeper fury

GORDY
They were my family

Gordys blind with rage Chokes her neck hard

Summoning all the power in him first to shut off her air
and blood and then to continue squeezing relishing her
every dying moment until hes snuffed out the life of
the person who took Anne and Matt from him And He cant its all hes wanted since he saw Anne and
Matt die but now he cant do it Hes a firefighter

He saves lives If he kills Selena Gordy crosses into

her world into Brandts world into the brutal nightmare
destroying Colombia and all the places like it and becomes
part of that sadness and death And

Gordy relaxes the chokehold enough so she can breathe
Selena gasps for air The impulse to murder has left
Gordy Theres a new resolve
GORDY
The killing ends here

Beat Selena pants

SELENA
It will never end

409 NEW ANGLE

Under which an EMBASSY SECURITY GUARD emerges from the
building He sees Gordy and Selena -- a large man
holding a smaller woman in a chokehold Draws his gun

EMBASSY SECURITY GUARD
Let her go

Gordy looks up at the nervous guard pointing his gun
Selena screams

SELENA
Please help me

EMBASSY SECURITY GUARD

Let her go
GORDY
No You dont understand
SELENA

Hes trying to kill me

EMBASSY SECURITY GUARD
Let her go or youre dead

Hes going to shoot Gordy has no choice As he lets
Selena go and stands --

GORDY
Hold us both till the police get
here

410 ANOTHER ANGLE

Its too late Selena stomps a heel into the Guards
knee crushing it then twists the gun from his hands
She points it at him and pulls the trigger and
In his agitation the guard never took the safety off
Selena glances quickly at the gun to find the safety
411 ANOTHER ANGLE

In the same moment Gordy grabs the crowbar from the

ground

412 SELENA

flicks off the safety and points the gun again
413 GORDY

hurls the crowbar with all his might and

414 NEW ANGLE

The GUN FIRES just as the crowbar hits Selena spoiling
her aim The bullet creases the guards arm Selena
recovers And the next BULLET

415 ANOTHER ANGLE

Isnt hers Its from Phipps GUN It takes Selena in
the middle of the back and explodes her heart on its way
through her body Shes dead on her feet Her body
crumples to the ground and empties its blood in a large
pool that quickly spreads over the slate

416 OTHER AGENTS

move in to help the guard as Phipps holsters his pistol
He walks to Gordy The two men share a long silent
look Its over Gordy looks again at Selenas body in
its pool of blood Then turns and goes

BRANDT S
entering the courtyard as Gordy walks out Brandts seen
Selena Hes smiling
( )

BRANDT
We got the bitch

Gordy hits him One of the jackhammer blows he slammed
into Claudio in the bunker A hard fist deep in the gut
that drives all the wind from Brandt and drops him to his
knees Beat Gordys voice is cold and hard --

GORDY
Youre no better than she is

And Gordy goes

INT FIREHOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

Gordy cranks away on the repaired ice cream maker Hes
wearing civvies He stops cranking spoons out a huge
dollop into a bowl

INT FIREHOUSE - TRUCK BAY

Gordy hands the bowl to Mauro whos playing in the front
seat of the pumper Mauro tastes it Thumbs up Gordy
smiles

Mike and the other men on Gordys old shift are watching
To Gordy --

MIKE
Itll be good to get you back

Gordy turns to them Looks into the faces of these men
the people closest to him in the world Beat Then --

GORDY
Its good to be home

Gordys still in pain still missing the wife and son
hell never see again But Gordys gonna be alright

Mauros gonna be with him Therell be fires to put out
and lives to save and basketball games and the multitude
of miseries and joys the firefighters in Spanish Harlem
see each and every day

As we PULL BACK OUT and AWAY from the old brick edifice
from which the big red truck will come bringing help

FADE OUT

THE END
