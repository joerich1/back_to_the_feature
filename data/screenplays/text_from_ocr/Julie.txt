creating a small mound in the center of the teddy bears
chest

Baxters beady eyes

ANGLE ON

The desk drawer It opens to reveal a dazzling array of
small razors and knives

Julie picks the knife of her choice it looks like a
scalpel

ANGLE ON

Poor old Baxter The scalpel slices a very thin careful
line across the bears belly

CLOSE ON
Julies angry face

She creates another cut just below the base of Baxters
throat

Again and again she cuts until it loses its delicate
precision

ANGLE ON
the remnants of Baxter who it seemed had gone through this
procedure before It doesnt look like hell suffer it

again

attached head and tears it off

She tosses it out the window

ANGLE ON

The kid looking back Hes about 12 grungy looking looks
pissed off

Watch where youre going bitch

Julie stares in disbelief for a moment but says nothing
Shyly she turns and looks back down to the ground

The kid walks off muttering to himself but we cant make
out what hes saying Beat Julie turns moving in the other
direction continuing with her walk

As she walks we hear a sort of thick wet smacking sound
Julie perks up intrigued She looks over to her left
entranced

butcher hes surprisingly small with a fitting leather
apron but he cuts up the remnants of meat with a certain
degree of force

Bills eyes go wide and his mouth forms a small o

BILL
Shit Youre right

He pulls the cleaver up and runs inside pulling his apron
off as soon as he gets through the door

ANGLE ON
Julie curious beginning to approach

Slowly cautiously she crosses the street She approaches
the table of raw meat like a pet approaching a toy Excited
and at the same time wondering whats the catch But
theres a gleam in her eyes finding something new
something that makes her feel content a feeling unfamiliar
to her

Fascinated she sticks out her hand to touch the wet pulpy
red mess For a moment she cautiously retracts her hand
but as soon as she pulls back she reaches out again

CLOSE ON

Julies hand running through the freshly cut raw meat She
lifts up her hand palm facing up to look at the blood on
her hand Her eyes are wide awestruck as the dark liquid

moves down her white skin

Beat Julie SMILES Its not a malicious smile Not a

harmful smile or an evil grin Its more like the smile of
a little girl whos just been kissed for the very first
time

ANGLE ON

Bill inside the shop checking to make sure hes washed all
the blood off his hands He has

BILL

Christ Tom I gotta go Ill take

care of that apron for you right
