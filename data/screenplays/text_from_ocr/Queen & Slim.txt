INT DINER - NIGHT 1 (SOMEWHERE IN OHIO) 1

Were in the kind of place that feels like everyone should
know your name But they don’t Families frequent this spot
when they’ve fallen on hard times It’s practically empty on
this boring Thursday SERVERS drop off hot plates while
ELDERLY PEOPLE sip cheap coffee at the counter

Our focus is directed toward a BLACK MAN and a BLACK WOMAN
sitting in a small booth in the back

The MAN has a slender frame and a laid back demeanor He’s
not a fan of rocking the boat or ruffling feathers but he
ain’t no punk either For the purpose of this story well

call him SLIM

The WOMAN She’s regal as fuck She’s not an easy laugh and
she’s always waiting for the other shoe to drop For the
purposes of this story we’ll call her QUEEN

Not unlike most first dates there are long silences and a lot
of forced small talk

The WAITRESS quickly drops off their food and walks away
without uttering a word Queen examines the spread

Slim prays over his food This is how he was raised Queen
sits awkwardly waiting for him to look up

As soon as he does --

QUEEN
Didn’t you ask for scrambled eggs

SLIM
Yeah

She clocks the two sunny side up eggs on his plate

SLIM (CONTD)
It’s all good

QUEEN
No it’s not

SLIM
It’s just eggs

QUEEN
I have a thing about that

SLIM
Eggs
They have

QUEEN
No about people not doing their
job well

SLIM
She’s got four kids and an
alcoholic husband at home She’s
doing the best she can

QUEEN
How do you know that

SLIM
She comes through my line every
Sunday yelling at her kids and
giving me a stack of coupons She
can never find her Costco card so I
always let her use mine so she can
get the discount

QUEEN

That’s nice of you
SLIM

Can I ask you something
QUEEN

I don’t know can you
SLIM

Easy I know good grammar
QUEEN

Do you
SLIM

We not in a classroom
a quick standoff

QUEEN
You gonna ask me your question or
not

SLIM
What took you so long to respond to
me

QUEEN
I didn’t realize that much time had
passed
SLIM
I sent you a very well crafted
message three weeks ago I spell
checked it and everything and got
crickets Then today out of the
blue you hit me up asking if I
wanna grab dinner What changed

QUEEN

I had a shitty day
SLIM

What was so shitty about it
QUEEN

The state decided to execute my

client

Queen says that as if she were giving him the logline to her
least favorite movie

In an instant Slim loses his appetite

SLIM
I didn’t know that was still legal
here

QUEEN

Yup It’s legal in 31 states And
Ohio happens to be one of ‘em

SLIM
Was he innocent

QUEEN
Even if he’s not - the state
shouldn’t decide whether he lives
or dies

SLIM
I’m sorry

QUEEN
Me too
(then)
Normally I’d just go home and have
a glass of wine by myself But I
didn’t feel like being alone Not
tonight

Slim can’t tell if this is a cry for help or a proposition
SLIM
You didn’t have any friends or
family you could call

QUEEN

No
SLIM

So you turned to Tinder
QUEEN

Yeah

Slim sips his soda

SLIM

Why’d you pick me
QUEEN

I liked your picture
SLIM

(flattered)

Word

QUEEN

You had this sad look on your face
I felt sorry for you

SLIM
Damn

QUEEN
I didn’t mean for that to sound
shady

SLIM

Well it did
Then --

SLIM (CONTD)
My dad took that picture of me

QUEEN
Why aren’t you smiling

Slim shrugs Not ready to divulge the reason just yet
They’re still getting to know each other

SLIM
To be honest I don’t have that
many photos of myself
QUEEN
Why not

SLIM
I know what I look like

QUEEN
Pictures aren’t just about vanity
They’re proof of your existence

SLIM
My family knows I exist That’s
enough

The idea of not having to prove oneself to the world is
foreign to Queen

Slim stares at Queen’s plate Most of her food is untouched
Particularly her Caesar salad

SLIM (CONTD)
You gon eat that

QUEEN
You can have some

He reaches over and stabs a few big pieces of lettuce with
his fork

SLIM
They always use just the right
amount of dressing
Then --
QUEEN
Do you really like this place or is

it the only spot you could afford

SLIM
It’s black owned

She wasn’t expecting that answer Queen can appreciate this
small token of righteousness

QUEEN
Touché

CUT TO
INT CAR - AN HOUR LATER - NIGHT 1 2

Slim drives a WHITE HONDA ACCORD Yeah he don’t give a fuck
about cars He tries to create a vibe by playing some neo-
soul music Which is regular soul music with a hint of
patchouli

He keeps looking down at his phone Checking the directions

QUEEN
You shouldn’t text and drive

SLIM
Ain’t nobody texting I’m making
sure I don’t get lost

She grabs Slim’s phone from his lap

QUEEN
I can tell you how to get to my
hotel
SLIM
Give me my phone
QUEEN
Relax I’m gonna give it back
SLIM
You gon tell me where to turn
QUEEN
Yeah
Queen points left
SLIM
Oh so now you gon point the
directions
QUEEN

I’m telling you where to go

Slim is visibly annoyed Queen starts sifting through his
phone

QUEEN (CONTD)
You made a playlist That’s cute

Slim tries to grab his phone back unsuccessfully

SLIM
Don’t go through my phone
She smiles

QUEEN
Did you like “In a Sentimental
Mood” before or after “Love Jones

SLIM
I knew about that shit way before
“Love Jones”

QUEEN
Don’t lie

SLIM
Okay - I fucked with it more after
I saw the movie

QUEEN
I appreciate your honesty

Then --

SLIM
So what happens tonight

QUEEN
You’re gonna drop me off and you’1l
go home I guess

SLIM
Oh

QUEEN
Did you think we were gonna have
sex

Slim is embarrassed
SLIM
No I thought we were gonna hang

out Maybe get to know each other

QUEEN
Nah I’m good

Slim takes his phone back from Queen causing him to SWERVE a
bit Then he SWITCHES LANES without signaling

Just as he starts to pick up speed He hears a horrifying
sound WOOP WOOP Every black person’s worst nightmare

We hear a robotic voice muffled through a loud speaker “Pull
over That corner right there”

Slim’s heart starts to race Queen’s heart beats at its usual
speed

QUEEN (CONTD)
Do you have any warrants

SLIM
Really

QUEEN
Do you

SLIM

Nah I ain’t got no warrants

QUEEN
Do you have any weapons in the car
Any narcotics

SLIM
I got a pocket knife in the glove
compartment

QUEEN
That’s fine

SLIM
I know it is
EXT STREET - NIGHT 1 3

The POLICE OFFICER steps out of his car and makes his way to
Slim’s door

He motions for Slim to roll down his window He does

POLICE OFFICER
Can you turn the radio down

Slim pauses for a beat Then he does as he’s told He’s
always been good at being obedient

The Police Officer aims the light directly in Slim’s eyes
Slim quickly shields his face so he can see what’s in front
of him

POLICE OFFICER (CONTD)
Put your hand down

He does as he’s told
QUEEN
He only had it up because you were
shining a light in his eyes

POLICE OFFICER
I’m trying to see inside the
vehicle

QUEEN
It’s just us

POLICE OFFICER
License and registration

Slim reaches for his wallet

SLIM
I’m grabbing my wallet

POLICE OFFICER
I can see that

QUEEN
(under her breath)
Well y’all like to shoot first and
ask questions later

POLICE OFFICER
Do you have something you wanna say
to me

QUEEN
No I don’t

Slim hands over his license Slowly As he reaches over to
rummage through his glove compartment his hand accidentally
grazes Queen’s thigh He’s not being fresh Just nervous He
finally finds his crumpled up registration and hands it over

POLICE OFFICER
Do you know why I pulled you over

SLIM
No sir

POLICE OFFICER
You forgot to use your signal back
there And you swerved a bit

Queen shakes her head

SLIM
Oh my bad

POLICE OFFICER
Yeah it is

The Police Officer takes Slim’s license and registration and
slowly walks back to his squad car

Queen sits there Seething Slim is calm as a cucumber

QUEEN
I can’t believe this shit

SLIM
Just chill

She doesn’t like being told what to do

QUEEN
Excuse me

SLIM
I told you to chill out

QUEEN
I have a right to be angry

SLIM
I ain’t tryna die tonight

The weight of that statement leaps out of Slim’s soul and
lands in Queen’s lap

INT SQUAD CAR - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT 1 4
The Police Officer talks to his DISPATCHER

On his dashboard we see a PHOTO It’s a picture of his WIFE
and KIDS

The Kids are TWIN BOYS They both have blonde hair and green
eyes They’re completely unaware of how privileged their
lives will be simply because they were born white and male

The Wife is a bored brunette whose dreams are no bigger than
her backyard

DISPATCHER
Whattya got

POLICE OFFICER
Black male Black female Both late
twenties They’re in a white Honda
(MORE)

POLICE OFFICER (CONTD)
Driver changed lanes without
signaling He was driving
erratically

DISPATCHER
Is he under the influence

POLICE OFFICER
I don’t know yet I’1ll make him do
a breathalyzer

DISPATCHER
Let me know if you need anything

POLICE OFFICER
Will do

INT SLIMS CAR - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT 1 5

The Officer is back at Slim’s window - leaning in a little
too close

POLICE OFFICER
Will you step out of the vehicle
please

QUEEN
(under her breath)
Shit

SLIM
Can I ask why Officer

POLICE OFFICER
No you can’t Step out of the car

Before he gets out of the car Queen and Slim lock eyes He
doesn’t know Queen very well but he can tell she has the
spirit of Nat Turner wrestling inside of her

Slim steps out and puts his hands on the roof of the car The
Police Officer proceeds to search him aggressively

POLICE OFFICER (CONTD)
You got any sharp objects in your
pockets I should know about

SLIM
No sir

POLICE OFFICER
Any illegal substances

SLIM
No sir

POLICE OFFICER
What about in the vehicle

SLIM
No sir

CUT TO

INT SLIM’S CAR - PASSENGER SEAT - SAME TIME - NIGHT 1

Queen’s left knee bounces uncontrollably Her chest goes up
and down

Queen looks in the rearview mirror and sees the Police
Officer interrogating Slim on the side of the road

CUT TO

EXT STREET - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT 1
The Police Officer finishes patting Slim down

POLICE OFFICER
Have you been drinking tonight

SLIM
No

Slim laughs

POLICE OFFICER
Why is that funny

SLIM
Cause I don’t drink

POLICE OFFICER
Do me a favor pop the trunk

SLIM
Why

POLICE OFFICER
Because I asked you to

Slim hesitates

SLIM
Ain’t nothing in there but some
shoe boxes

POLICE OFFICER
Let’s see ‘em

SLIM
Okay

Queen HONKS the horn in an effort to get the Police Officers
attention

POLICE OFFICER
Can I help you

QUEEN
Do you have a warrant

POLICE OFFICER
Ma’am he’s already agreed to the
search So I don’t need one

Slim pops the trunk

He was telling the truth The only thing in his trunk are a
bunch of sneakers Consumerism is his only vice

Slim feels vindicated and violated at the same time

SLIM
Told you

QUEEN (0S)
Can we go now

The Officer’s cheeks turn bright red

POLICE OFFICER
What’s in the boxes

SLIM
Shoes

POLICE OFFICER
I’m gonna check just to be sure

SLIM
Fine

Then

SLIM (CONTD)
Can you please hurry up

And just like that a SWITCH GOES OFF in the Police Officers
head He feels disrespected His uniform isn’t as
intimidating as he thought it was His super powers are
imaginary So he goes from 2018 to 1953 real quick

He PULLS OUT HIS GUN and AIMS IT AT SLIM

POLICE OFFICER
Get on the ground and put your
hands behind your back now

SLIM
Are you serious

POLICE OFFICER
Get on the ground

Slim does as he’s told

The Officer keeps the gun pointed at Slim’s head while
looking at Slim’s car to make sure Queen stays inside

But after a beat she GETS OUT OF THE CAR to see what the fuck
is going on

QUEEN
Why is he under arrest

The Officer turns around and AIMS HIS GUN AT HER With one
hand The other hand stays planted on Slim’s shoulder

POLICE OFFICER
Ma’am if you don’t get back in the
car I’m gonna have to arrest you
too

QUEEN
I’m happy to get back in the car
but would you mind telling me why
youre arresting him

POLICE OFFICER
Get back in the vehicle now

QUEEN
I’m reaching for my cell phone --

POLICE OFFICER
Keep your hands where I can see
them

QUEEN
I have the right to record this
arrest

Queen REACHES in her pocket

Officer Reed AIMS HIS GUN AT HER and FIRES OFF TWO SHOTS
BOOM BOOM

The first shot misses her but the SECOND SHOT GRAZES HER
RIGHT THIGH She collapses to the ground And hits her head
on the pavement

Slim SCREAMS for her He tries to run toward her but Officer
Reed grabs him by the shoulders and slams him on the ground

Officer Reed and Slim roll around on the ground for a few
seconds Until Officer Reed finally pins Slim to the ground
and points the gun at his face

OFFICER REED
Don’t move

Officer Reed sees Queen trying to get up He points his gun
at her again - while the Officer’s attention is diverted -
Slim KNOCKS the firearm out of his hand

When the gun goes flying - Officer Reed reaches for it but
Slim gets to it first

When Slim turns around he sees Officer Reed LUNGING toward
him

Slim FIRES the gun BOOM
HE SHOOTS OFFICER REED IN THE NECK Killing him instantly

Slim drops the gun and stops breathing Queen muffles her own
scream

fficer Reed’s lifeless body lies on the pavement A pool of
lood quickly forms around him

lim gets up and runs to her side He sees the blood running

O
b
Queen applies pressure to her fresh wound and winces in pain
s
down her leg

SLIM
Oh shit

He tries to help her up but she doesn’t want his assistance

QUEEN
I got it

She slowly stands up Gritting her teeth the entire time
Independence hurts

Queen looks at the dead Police Officer

QUEEN (CONTD)
Are you okay

Physically yes Emotionally no

SLIM
Yeah

Slim puts Queen’s arm around his neck He knows she’s
struggling to stand on one good leg

She kneels down and grabs the gun Then she gently shoves it
in his pants

It’s their gun now
Queen turns to face Officer Reed’s squad car The headlights
are still on Giving the small CAMERA on the DASHBOARD a

perfect view of her face

QUEEN
Let’s go

Slim looks at her for a long beat

SLIM
We can’t just leave him here

QUEEN
Yes we can Now let’s go

Slim walks Queen back to the car The engine is still
purring He helps her into the passenger seat

Slim walks around to the other side and gets in the driver’s
seat Still in shock

As they drive off into the darkness all we hear is the static
filled radio coming from the squad car

MALE VOICE

Officer Reed Officer Reed do you
need back up Officer Reed do you

As we hear sirens far off in the distance we --

CUT TO

OPENING CREDITS

INT CAR - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT 1

Slim drives faster than his car is used to going No music
playing They’re no longer wrapping up a date Now they’re
fugitives on the run And one of them is wounded

Slim has no idea where they’re going Neither does Queen
He’s just driving Aimlessly

Slim grabs his phone

SLIM
I gotta call my dad

Queen snatches his phone and tosses it out the window She
chucks hers as well

SLIM (CONTD)
What the fuck are you doing

QUEEN
We can’t call anybody It’1ll make
them accomplices

SLIM
You could’ve just said that shit
Now we ain’t got no phones
QUEEN
A phone ain’t nothing but a
tracking device anyway

Slim is shell shocked as Queen tries to take deep breaths

SLIM
Youre bleeding a lot

QUEEN
It’s okay it only grazed me

The severity of what they did starts to sink in

SLIM
Fuck Why didn’t you just stay in
the car

QUEEN

So this is my fault

SLIM
You should’ve just let me handle
it

is

QUEEN
If I didn’t get out the car youd
be dead right now

Slim looks at her wound There’s a big gash

SLIM
We gotta get you to a hospital

QUEEN
No We can’t Just keep driving

SLIM
Here --

Slim takes off his jacket while driving

SLIM (CONTD)
Use my jacket as a bandage

She balls it up and presses it against her leg It hurts like
hell

QUEEN
Fuck

SLIM
I have a small bottle of bourbon
under the seat

She looks at him with judgmental eyes

QUEEN
I thought you didn’t drink

SLIM
I don’t My cousin stole that from
a hotel and left it in my car

She grabs it and pours some on her open wound Queen grits
her teeth and presses against it to stop the bleeding

Slim’s mind starts to race He can’t sit still

SLIM (CONTD)
What if he was wearing a body cam
Or had a camera in his car This
shit bout to be all over the
fucking news

QUEEN
That’s why we have to keep going

SLIM
We can’t run forever

QUEEN
I know that But right now we have
to run until we come up with a
better plan

SLIM
Well start throwing out some
ideas

QUEEN

Since when am I in charge of coming
up with the ideas

SLIM
Since you made the decision to run

QUEEN
We made that decision together

SLIM
I don’t remember that

QUEEN

SLIM

Slim’s eyes start to water Queen grabs his hand
QUEEN
If you turn yourself in - you’1l

powerless and small

QUEEN (CONTD)
All we can do is go forward

22 EXT TRUCK - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT 1 22

They’re sitting on the bed of the truck - under the stars

Slim eats fast and loud Queen eats like a rabbit She
watches him devour his food with a disgusted look on her
face

QUEEN
You make a lot of noise when you
eat

SLIM

Woman this could be my last meal -
would you just let me be

QUEEN
It’s hard for me to eat with you
making so much noise

Slim tries to eat quieter He fails but Queen appreciates
the gesture

SLIM
I’ve never heard of someone not
being able to eat because they’re
disgusted by the sounds of other
people eating

QUEEN
I know it’s weird but I have a
thing about it

SLIM
How do you avoid the sounds of
people eating

QUEEN
I eat alone most of the time

SLIM
That’s not surprising

She cuts her eyes at him Slim stops eating for a second

SLIM (CONTD)
You scared

QUEEN

SLIM
Youre lying

QUEEN
How do you know
A beat

SLIM
You answered too fast

QUEEN
I thought if a person answered too
fast it meant they were telling the
truth

SLIM
My dad always told me if a person
answers too quick it means they had
the lie ready to go

QUEEN
Wow Well that’s good to know

SLIM
How do you know if your clients are
telling the truth

QUEEN
I don’t

SLIM
Then how can you defend them

QUEEN
That’s my job

SLIM
But why do you do it

QUEEN
I refuse to let certain states swap
out a southern tree for an electric
chair and call it justice

SLIM
Are you a good lawyer

QUEEN
I’m an excellent lawyer

SLIM
Why do black people always feel the
need to be excellent Why can’t we
just be ourselves

QUEEN
We should go

She hops down and gets in the passenger side Slim wonders
why she was so abrupt just then Maybe he struck a nerve

He shakes it off and hops in the drivers seat But before
they can pull off he hears --

CHUBBY (0S)
Hey is this y’all

Chubby plays them a video on his phone It’s the DASH CAM
FOOTAGE of Slim shooting Officer Reed in the neck

The video has already been viewed by over a hundred thousand

CHUBBY

QUEEN
We can’t go to a hospital

CHUBBY

Large Black Man moans in pain every time he tries to move his
leg

SLIM
Where’s the nearest hospital

QUEEN

SLIM
Would you calm down

QUEEN

Slim drives carefully as to not irritate the Large Black
Man’s injury Chubby holds his dad’s hand the whole way

LARGE BLACK MAN

QUEEN
What do you mean

LARGE BLACK MAN
Killing these crooked ass cops We

LARGE BLACK MAN

QUEEN

CHUBBY
Some dude was taking his daughter
to school minding his own
business and that cop killed him
for no reason

Queen remembers the case Slim cuts his eyes at her

SLIM
Did you know about this

QUEEN
Of course not

He doesn’t know what to believe Then --

QUEEN (CONTD)

EXT HOSPITAL - NIGHT 1 24
Slim swerves into the driveway

SLIM
Alright We’re here

Chubby opens the car door and drapes his dad’s arm around his
neck He stumbles a little bit but eventually he makes it
out and walks up to the sliding doors of URGENT CARE

Before Slim can pull off the Large Black Man turns around
and says --

LARGE BLACK MAN (CONTD)

He raises his right fist then he limps inside

SLIM
How long before a helicopter starts
flying over us

QUEEN
I don’t know

SLIM
Please tell me you didn’t fuck with
that cop on purpose

QUEEN
Of course not

SLIM
You seemed real calm when you saw
his dead body

QUEEN
He shot at me

SLIM
You’re crazy man

QUEEN
It should be a sin to call a black
woman crazy

SLIM
You one of those people that thinks
God is a black woman

QUEEN
I don’t believe in God

SLIM

Queen clocks the almost empty gas tank

QUEEN

be walking into gas stations
QUEEN
It’s not that scary I told you
what to do
SLIM
You only saying that cause you
don’t have to do it

QUEEN
You got this I believe in you

SLIM
Don’t patronize me

QUEEN

CUT TO

INT GAS STATION - MOMENTS LATER - DAY 2 26

Slim stands in front of a TEENAGE WHITE BOY This is his part
time job And he hates it

Slim looks at the newspapers stacked in front of him Him and
Queen’s faces are on the cover

The word “WANTED” rests above their heads in bold black
letters

SLIM
Let me get forty on pump nine

The Teenager waits for Slim to hand over the money

But instead - Slim lifts up his shirt and shows his gun
That’s his currency

TEENAGE WHITE BOY
Is that a 45

SLIM
Yeah

TEENAGE WHITE BOY
Can I hold it

SLIM
No you can’t

TEENAGE WHITE BOY
Ill pay for your gas if you let me
hold it

SLIM
That’s not a fair trade

TEENAGE WHITE BOY
If you don’t let me hold it -
youll have to stick up another gas
station

SLIM
I could kill you right now

TEENAGE WHITE BOY
You don’t look like a killer to me

Slim appreciates the fact this young man can see he’s not a
cold blooded killer

After a beat he takes the gun out of his pants and hands it
over The kid goes from being an innocent Teenager to John
Wayne in a matter of seconds

TEENAGE WHITE BOY (CONTD)
Why does holding a deadly weapon
make me feel so alive

Then he aims the gun at Slim’s head They stare at each other
for a long beat Slim starts to shake The teenager holds the
gun steady Barely shaking at all While Slim fears for his
life

SLIM
What the fuck is you doing

The Teenager starts laughing and puts the gun down

TEENAGE WHITE BOY
I’m just messing with you

The Teenager puts forty bucks in the register and activates
the gas pump Then hands the gun back to Slim

And just like that he goes back to being a kid again

cared for it but its new inhabitants could care less

Queen BANGS on the door

SLIM
Damn why you knocking like you the

caught us by now

SLIM
Touché

This brings a small smile to Queen’s face

Then she keeps knocking Until a TALL BLACK GIRL with a fire
in her belly and a glimmer in her eye answers the door She

while

Uncle Earl wipes his hands and walks over to give her a hug
The embrace is one-sided

UNCLE EARL
Well if it isn’t the black Bonnie
and Clyde

Earl reaches out to shake Slim’s hand Earl’s hand is twice
the size of his

QUEEN
I don’t know what the news is
saying but whatever it is - it’s
not true

UNCLE EARL

Earl stares at Queen for a long beat A little too
Causing her to look away

UNCLE EARL (CONTD)

UNCLE EARL
Well y’all need to hurry up cause

Queen let’s that sink in She marvels at Goddess’ thin frame

innocent she really is

He looks at her and smiles

EXT OPEN ROAD - DAY 3 (DAWN) 42

Slim and Queen drive through the bible belt It’s a mix of
beautiful landscapes and poverty

SLIM
It’s beautiful out here

Then they see a bunch of PRISONERS working the land They’re
in a long line Moving in unison

Queen’s heart aches for the men in blue jumpsuits who mean
nothing more to this country than a pair of strong hands that
can do cheap manual labor

QUEEN
Is it
SLIM
I’m just tryna make conversation
QUEEN
I’m just being honest
SLIM
Do you have to be honest all the
time
QUEEN

Do you want me to be silent

SLIM
I didn’t say that

There’s an awkward silence Then Queen stares out the window
for a bit She takes in the fields the colorful sky and the
birds chirping He’s right It is beautiful But there are
still some ugly parts she can’t ignore

Queen searches through the CDs and finds a pleasant surprise
She shoves it in and hits play

Queen climbs into the backseat and lays on her back Letting
the wind blow through her long flowing wig

SLIM (CONTD)
What you doing

QUEEN
I’m gon try to get some sleep

Slim has gotten more comfortable driving the Cadillac He
drives it like he bought it with his own money

Queen’s eyelids become heavy Eventually she falls asleep
Slim watches her in the rearview mirror

He’s never been more frustrated and enamored by anyone in his
life

CUT TO

car stereo - it’s coming from outside

There’s a club a few feet away in the middle of the woods It

looks like the JOOK JOINT from THE COLOR PURPLE
Slim pulls over and slows down

QUEEN
What are you doing Are you crazy

SLIM
I heard a band playing I wanted to
see where it was coming from

QUEEN
We need to keep going

Come on Don’t do me like that

SLIM
Nah you shouldve said yes

QUEEN
Okay fine I’1l go

SLIM
It’s too late now

QUEEN
I have the right to change my mind

Slim looks away
QUEEN (CONTD)
Okay - I’m officially saying yes to
the second date Now where we
going

SLIM
I’m taking you dancing Let’s go

Slim gets out of the car
QUEEN
Can we dance once we get to where

were going Just to be safe

SLIM
I’m tired of playing it safe

Slim extends his hand to her
QUEEN
Youre willing to risk getting

caught just so we can dance

SLIM
Hell yeah

Queen isn’t convinced

SLIM (CONTD)
One dance and we can leave I
promise

She refuses to budge

SLIM (CONTD)
I’1l buy you a drink

And with that she grabs his hand and we --

CUT TO

INT JUKE JOINT - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT 3 44

This place is so crowded the walls are sweating This small
establishment feels like it was built during a time when
black folks still had to drink from the shitty water
fountain

The lighting is pretty dim And everyone is on the dance
floor grinding slow and hard to a THREE MAN BAND playing BB
King’s “How Blue Can You Get”

Slim takes Queen’s hand Startling her

SLIM
Why you so jumpy

QUEEN
I’m nervous

SLIM
Ain’t nobody in here thinking ‘bout
us

She rolls her eyes Slim leads her to the middle of the dance
floor and pulls her in close She shoves him away

QUEEN
Watch your hands

Queen slowly puts her arms around Slim’s neck He puts his
arms around her waist careful not to touch her ass The
music gets louder and even more soulful as Queen and Slim
start to find their groove

Slim looks around and realizes the prettiest girl in this
place is in his arms He can’t help but grin from ear to ear

Then he looks down and sees Queen has rested her head on his
chest She’s so close she can hear his heartbeat

And right now it’s beating pretty fast So is hers Slim
holds Queen a little tighter She wipes the sweat from his
brow

As the song reaches a thunderous CRESCENDO Slim leans in for
a kiss - caught in the moment - Queen denies him

QUEEN (CONTD)
Don’t you owe me a drink

SLIM
What do you want

QUEEN
Bourbon The expensive kind

Slim makes his way through the crowd A few people look at
him longer than they should

He makes it to the bar and finds a HEAVY SET BLACK WOMAN
slinging drinks She recognizes Slim right away

HEAVY SET BLACK WOMAN
Hey handsome

Slim has never been referred to as handsome before

SLIM
Hi

He is out of his depth as he tries to pick the right alcohol

HEAVY SET BLACK WOMAN
What can I get you

SLIM
Bourbon

She grabs a dusty bottle of bourbon from high on the shelf
and pours two shots

SLIM (CONTD)
I don’t drink

HEAVY SET BLACK WOMAN
Maybe you should start

He looks at her perplexed

HEAVY SET BLACK WOMAN (CONTD)
These are on the house

Slim grabs the drinks but before he can leave she touches
his hand

HEAVY SET BLACK WOMAN (CONTD)
Don’t worry You’re safe here
They share a head nod
Then Slim quickly grabs the drinks and goes to find Queen

SLIM
The bartender recognized me

QUEEN
Oh shit We gotta go

Slim looks around and sees nothing but friendly and
supportive faces

Queen drinks the shot Slim drinks his too It burns the fuck
out of his throat Queen pats his chest and pulls him in
close

SLIM
I think we good

QUEEN
I don’t know

SLIM
Trust me

She looks him deep in the eyes and allows herself to let go
The band plays a slower song It’s romantic yet rough

Queen and Slim sway back and forth Holding each other tight
Burying their faces in each other’s shoulders

Some of the crowd backs away Watching them Admiring them
Rooting for them Praying for them

This looks like the first dance at a small wedding Queen and
Slim look like a happy couple with their whole lives ahead of
them

As the song comes to a close the crowd applauds the band

Then --

QUEEN
We should go

CUT TO

45 INT CAR - NIGHT 3 45

Queen has her bare feet up on the dashboard Slim gives her
the side eye

SLIM
You lucky you got cute feet

QUEEN
Even if they weren’t they’d still
be sitting right here

SLIM
Nah I would’ve stopped and got you
some gym socks or something

QUEEN
That’s messed up

SLIM
Honestly I don’t think dudes even
cared about women’s feet until
Eddie Murphy made it a thing

QUEEN
I know But the difference is he
can be picky about a woman’s feet
The rest of y’all need to be happy
somebody’s even laying next to yo
ass

She can see Slim is falling asleep at the wheel again

QUEEN (CONTD)
You need me to drive

SLIM
Nah I got it

QUEEN
No you don’t

SLIM
I’m good

QUEEN
Explain something to me Why do
dudes not like asking for help

SLIM
It’s a sign of weakness

QUEEN
That’s the dumbest shit I’ve ever
heard

SLIM

You say that but then turn around
and want a strong mandingo type
muthafucka

QUEEN
I don’t want that

SLIM
What do you want

QUEEN
That’s a loaded question

SLIM
We ain’t got nothing but time

Queen leans back in her seat She’s so far back she’s
practically lying down Like she were at a therapy session

QUEEN
I want a guy to show me myself

Slim glances at her Her legs are on full display

QUEEN (CONTD)
I want him to love me so deeply I’m
not afraid to show him how ugly I
can be I want him to show me scars
I never knew I had But I don’t
want him to make them go away - I
want him to hold my hand while I
nurse them myself - and then I want
him to cherish the bruises they
leave behind

SLIM
Damn no wonder you still single
That’s a lot of shit

She can’t help but crack a smile

QUEEN
Maybe it is

SLIM
But you deserve that

QUEEN
I don’t think we deserve anything
in this life We get what we work
for That’s it

She watches him drive Drinking him in

QUEEN (CONTD)
What do you want

He breathes deep

SLIM
I want somebody that’s ride or die

QUEEN
Oh God What does that even mean

SLIM
I just want somebody that’s always
gon love me No matter what I want
someone that’s gon hold my hand and
never let it go

He looks over at Queen They lock eyes She wants to look
away but can’t

She’s never heard someone describe love in such simple terms

SLIM (CONTD)
She gotta be special though - cause
she gon be my legacy

QUEEN
What do you mean

SLIM
Look I ain’t gon bend the world

As long as my lady remembers me
fondly That’s all I need

As Queen lets that sink in we --

CUT TO

A46 EXT STREET - LATER A46

Slim pulls into a gas station

CUT TO

INT GAS STATION - BATHROOM - DAY 4 46

Queen tries not to touch anything while washing up ina
disgusting bathroom

She looks in the mirror for a long beat Wondering how she
got here Wondering what the future holds

Queen looks around the bathroom and realizes she’s all alone
in the world

Then - KNOCK KNOCK

SLIM (0S)
You okay in there

For the first time in her life a man’s voice reassures her
that she’s not alone

The sound of Slim’s voice reminds her there’s a chance
everything will be okay

QUEEN
Yeah I’m good
CUT TO
EXT GAS STATION - BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS - DAY 4 47

Slim leans against the wall outside the bathroom door

He watches people as they walk by He wonders if they
recognize him He wonders if they’re going to turn him in

Then he spots a LITTLE BLACK GIRL walking with her MOTHER

The Little Girl locks eyes with Slim She gives him the stink
eye for staring at her

Then she laughs at him As if to taunt him for losing a
staring competition he never knew he was a part of The
Little Girl’s sassy demeanor reminds him of Queen This
brings a smile to his face

As he stands there in a daze - Queen bursts out of the
bathroom Almost as if she’s reborn

They look at each other Both smitten Unsure of what the
future holds Then - Queen extends her hand to him

QUEEN
Come on

SLIM
You wash your hands
She grabs his hand with glee and they both rush to get back
in the car

INT CAR - LATER - DAY 4 48

Queen is driving now Slim rubs his bald head

SLIM
Skinny Luther or fat Luther
QUEEN
Uh skinny Luther
SLIM
Ah fuck
QUEEN
What
SLIM

I don’t trust people that like
skinny Luther

QUEEN

Skinny Luther was dope He had a
lot more energy He sang better
And his clothes fit

SLIM
You crazy as hell Fat Luther was
the shit Who else you know can
pull off a jheri curl and a three
piece suit at the same damn time

She’s quiet

SLIM (CONTD)
Right nobody

As she continues to drive she sees a few HORSES grazing the
land She immediately pulls over

SLIM (CONTD)
What you doing I thought you said
no more stopping

QUEEN
I changed my mind

SLIM
You can’t change your mind We
gotta go

She puts her hand on his thigh

QUEEN
Relax

He does She slowly gets out of the car

EXT FIELD - MOMENTS LATER - DAY 4 49

Queen walks up to the horses Judging by her demeanor she’s
more comfortable around animals than she is people

She goes up to one and takes the horse’s nose in her hands
She becomes one with this beautiful living creature

SLIM
You crazy What if it gets scared
and kicks you in the face

QUEEN
They’re not wild

Queen takes his hand and forces him to pet the horse The
horse is calm and so is Slim

It’s quiet all around them

SLIM
How you know so much about horses

QUEEN
My uncle used to take me horseback
riding when I was a kid

SLIM
Really

QUEEN
I told you he didn’t used to always
be like that

Queen walks over to the other horse and looks in its eyes

QUEEN (CONTD)
He told me nothing scares a white
man more than seeing a black man on
a horse

SLIM
Why

QUEEN
Because they have to look up at
him

SLIM

I’ve never been on a horse

QUEEN
You should try it sometime

Queen starts walking back to the car Slim doesn’t follow
her

SLIM
Maybe I should do it right now

QUEEN
You can do it when we have more
time I’1l take you

SLIM
When

QUEEN
I don’t know

SLIM
What if we don’t make it

The weight of his question renders them both speechless

QUEEN
We will

SLIM
You don’t know that

He’s right She doesn’t

SLIM (CONTD)
Help me get on the horse

Queen walks over to him

SLIM (CONTD)
Which one is the calmest

Queen chooses the one that’s still grazing She holds Slims
hand and helps HOIST him up onto the horse

The horse BUCKS at first Then Queen whispers to the horse
and eventually the stallion calms down

Slim is nervous at first but eventually he relaxes After a
moment Slim’s posture shifts He puffs out his chest and
looks out into the world like the king he is

Queen looks up at him They hold each other’s gaze for a long
beat

QUEEN
It’s nice isn’t it
SLIM
Yeah
Then -
MAN’S VOICE (0S)
Hey

The horse BUCKS again But only this time Queen can’t calm
him down The horse knocks Slim off his back Slim hits the
ground HARD Getting the wind knocked out of him
Queen helps him up and they run to the Cadillac

They hop in the car and speed off

INT CAR - LATER THAT AFTERNOON - DAY 4 50
As the sun starts to set the Cadillac starts to smoke
The smoke is coming from UNDERNEATH the car

Slim is under the car It’s smoking like crazy Queen stands
over him Freaking out

QUEEN
I think there’s a body shop up the
road

SLIM

Really far up the road

Queen walks to the back of the car and assumes the position

QUEEN
Then we should start pushing

Slim gives in and they both start pushing the car up the
road They try to hurry while they still have light

CUT TO

EXT GAS STATION - GARAGE - 45 MINUTES LATER - DAY 4 52

OLDER BLACK MAN

He looks at them suspiciously

QUEEN
Yeah we’re on our way to visit

OLDER BLACK MAN
Why y’all in a rush to do that

He lets out a hearty laugh and then spits tobacco juice in a
cup

OLDER BLACK MAN (CONTD)
I can try to get it back to you

SLIM
How much mo

OLDER BLACK MAN

QUEEN

Queen sits on a bench Arms folded Looking at the clock

The Police Officer snatches the phone from Slim’s Father

SLIM’S FATHER

SLIM

OLDER BLACK MAN

SLIM
Then why ain’t you give us a
discount

OLDER BLACK MAN
Cause unlike the rest of these
simple ass niggas I don’t approve
of what y’all did

QUEEN
We didn’t do it on purpose

OLDER BLACK MAN
It don’t matter if it was on
purpose or not You gave them a
license to kill us

QUEEN
That cop shot at me

OLDER BLACK MAN
You gave ‘em an excuse

QUEEN
You weren’t there

OLDER BLACK MAN
No I wasn’t But if I was I
would’ve taken the ticket and been
on my way

QUEEN
Can you work more and talk less

OLDER BLACK MAN
I could work faster if y’all left
me the fuck alone

QUEEN
I’m not leaving this car

OLDER BLACK MAN
What if I gave you some insurance

QUEEN
I don’t want no house keys or no
drivers license cause all that can
be replaced

The Older mechanic walks to the garage door and knocks on it

After a beat a SKINNY BROWN KID no more than seventeen lifts
it up The young man looks like Barack Obama long before he
fell in love with Michelle He wears a dirty T-shirt and
skinny jeans

SKINNY BROWN KID
Yes sir

OLDER BLACK MAN
You wanna take these nice folks on
a walk

One look at Queen and Slim and he lights up like a Christmas
tree He obviously doesn’t share his father’s views about
them

SKINNY BROWN KID
Yeah

Then -

SKINNY BROWN KID (CONTD)
Yes sir

OLDER BLACK MAN
I need some time to fix their car
Keep ‘em occupied until then

SKINNY BROWN KID
Yes sir

Slim walks over and shakes the young man’s hand

SLIM
I’m -

SKINNY BROWN KID
I know who you are It’s an honor
to meet you

SLIM
What’s your name

SKINNY BROWN KID
Everybody calls me Junior

His father beams with pride

Then Junior takes Queen’s hand and kisses it sweetly

EXT DIRT ROAD - AFTERNOON - DAY 4 56
Queen and Slim walk hand in hand Junior leads the way

SLIM
Where is everybody

JUNIOR
There’s nothing to do around here
People just go to work and go home

SLIM
I know the feeling

JUNIOR
I can’t believe y’all are here I
was just watching you on TV and now
you’re right here next to me Shit
is crazy

Slim remembers what it was like to be Junior’s age When the
weight of the world wasn’t on his shoulders and everything
was exciting

JUNIOR (CONTD)
I hope y’all make it

Without knowing it Junior reminds them their days could be
numbered - and every breath should be cherished

SLIM
Me too
JUNIOR
Even if y’all don’t it’1l be okay
QUEEN
How so
JUNIOR

Cause then you’ll be immortal
Slim walks quietly - digesting the thought

SLIM
I like that

Queen takes a deep breath Drinking in her simple
surroundings Appreciating the quiet For once Then --

QUEEN
Id rather live

They finally arrive at Junior’s secret spot It’s a small
hill with a perfect view of the sunset

Queen Slim and Junior sit on the grass and marvel at the
sun as it prepares to say goodnight

Queen looks at the purple and orange sky - then she looks at
Slim He’s so serene He’s made peace with whatever the
outcome will be Junior looks up to him Literally and
figuratively

And for the first time in her life - she sees God

CUT TO

INT GARAGE - LATER THAT NIGHT - NIGHT 4 57

Queen and Slim get back in their newly repaired Cadillac She
turns on the car and it hums like it just came off the
factory line

SLIM
Yo Junior Can you take our
picture

JUNIOR
Yeah

QUEEN

I don’t think that’s a good idea

SLIM
Come on I want proof we were here

This is proof Slim remembers everything She likes that he’s
using her own logic against her

She gives in And they both look at Junior - ready to be
captured

Queen has her hand on the wheel Her toned arm on full
display Slim leans forward He doesn’t look at the camera -
he looks at her as if she were his bride to be

Queen stares directly into the lens the look in her eyes is
the perfect combination of fear and pride

We linger on them long enough to realize they’re no longer
the people we met at the diner

CUT TO

INT CAR - NIGHT 4 58
Queen is driving Deep in thought Slim is fast asleep
They drive by a sign that reads WELCOME TO GEORGIA

Queen stares at it for a long beat It brings back an
unwanted memory

She makes an impulsive turn Jolting Slim awake

SLIM
Yo

She’s on a mission

QUEEN
Do you mind if we make a detour

SLIM
I do actually

Queen doesn’t care and makes a hard left turn She drives
down a winding road Tears in her eyes

SLIM (CONTD)
You okay

QUEEN
Not really

He sits up and wipes the sleep out of his eyes

Slim can tell she needs to be held in this moment but he
doesn’t know if that’s permitted He reaches out and touches
the small of her back She allows it

His hand is bigger than she realized He rubs her back softly
at first - then he applies more pressure to help her relax
and to make sure she feels his presence in a way she hasn’t
before

Her heart is beating so fast he can feel her body pulse His
heartbeat syncs up with hers They are connected

CUT TO

EXT CEMETERY - MOMENTS LATER - DAWN 59
Queen stares at a tombstone
ETTA JOHNSON - BELOVED MOTHER AND DAUGHTER

Slim stands a few feet behind her Far enough to give her
space But close enough to let her know she’s not alone

QUEEN
We were close when I was younger
but when I got older I felt like I
didn’t know her anymore She didn’t
know me either We could go months
without talking And when we did -
I hated it I had nothing to say to
her

(MORE)

QUEEN (CONTD)
She wanted a connection so badly
but I just didn’t care I didn’t
need her anymore

She turns to look at Slim Searching for judgement in his
eyes There is none

QUEEN (CONTD)
I used to call her the great
pretender

SLIM
Why

QUEEN
She was really good at acting like
everything was okay

Queen extends her hand to Slim He takes it and moves in
closer

She kneels down and pulls up a few weeds crowding her
mother’s resting place - all the while still holding onto
Slim’s hand Queen kisses her palm and touches the cold
tombstone

This is what closure looks like
She lets go of Slim’s hand and makes her way back to the car

Slim hangs back He stares at her mother’s grave a little
longer

INT CAR - HOURS LATER - DAY 5 60

Queen and Slim sit in a parked car Slim is in the driver’s
seat Queen is in the passenger seat

QUEEN
My grandma left the house to both
of them My mom wanted to sell it
My uncle wanted to live in it
Typical family bullshit

SLIM
Yeah

QUEEN
One night they were at the house
fighting he was really fucked up
and he pushed her down a flight of
stairs She cracked her skull
(MORE )

QUEEN (CONTD)
She bled out so quick that by the
time the ambulance got there she
was already dead

Slim hangs his head Unsure of what to say

QUEEN (CONTD)
I had just passed the bar I was
excited to try my first case I
never thought that would be it

SLIM
How could you defend the person
that killed your own mother

QUEEN
I knew it was an accident

SLIM
Does it ever piss you off that he’s
alive and she isn’t

QUEEN
All the time

Queen turns on the RADIO We hear a journalist ON THE RADIO
reporting on a NATIONWIDE PEACEFUL RALLY in progress

RADIO PERSONALITY
People are in support of the two
fugitives accused of killing a
police officer in cold blood

Slim and Queen aren’t really listening to the radio It’s
just background noise to them

Then Slim takes Queen’s face in his reliable hands and kisses
her It’s so pure and innocent - it’s unclear if sex will
follow

But then he pulls her in close and kisses her again The
second kiss is anything but innocent It’s the perfect
combination of lust and melancholy Slim pulls Queen on top
of him Rather than entering her right away - he lifts her up
to his face - her hands press up against the ceiling while he
DEVOURS her

CUT TO

EXT STREET - SAME TIME - DAY 5 61

Were following Junior walking down the street with purpose

We watch as he walks up on a protest The same one the
journalist spoke of on the radio

He joins - A SEA OF BLACK and BROWN BODIES are MARCHING in
PROTEST They are full of PRIDE and VENOM

They hold up signs in support of Queen and Slim They chant
and walk proudly

The PROTESTORS are surrounded by POLICE OFFICERS The
Officers are dressed in SWAT GEAR Ready for war

The Officers form a line The Protestors form a line opposite
them

The Police stand completely still like statues of oppression
in the South The Protestors are vibrant not violent

Junior stands in front of the crowd He looks like a young
Eldridge Cleaver

A BLACK POLICE OFFICER stops him from going any further The
Officer is dressed in bullet proof gear from head to toe

Junior is only wearing a hoodie and sweatpants to protect
him It’s David and Goliath all over again

BLACK POLICE OFFICER
If you don’t vacate the premises
I’m gonna have to arrest you son

JUNIOR
I’m not your son

BLACK POLICE OFFICER
What’s your name young man

JUNIOR
I don’t have to tell you that

BLACK POLICE OFFICER
I don’t want to hurt you Trust me
But it’s my job to clear the
streets Which means you can’t be
here

JUNIOR
I have a right to protest

BLACK POLICE OFFICER
I understand that but you don’t
have a permit So that means you’re
breaking the law

JUNIOR
What you gon do kill me

BLACK POLICE OFFICER
No but I will arrest you

The Police Officer LIFTS UP THE BULLETPROOF SHIELD ON HIS
HELMET - so there’s one less barrier between them

BLACK POLICE OFFICER (CONTD)
I’m begging you Go home

The Police Officer GRABS Junior by his arms -- in an attempt
to calm him down But he wrestles free

Junior pulls out a SMALL HAND GUN He aims it at the only
part of the Officer’s body that’s not covered

He SHOOTS him in the face Causing the Officer’s head to
EXPLODE IN HIS HELMET

Completely unaware the world is burning around them

Slim reaches for Queen’s hand while she drives She takes his
hand and doesn’t let it go

EXT HOUSE - IN GEORGIA - LATER THAT DAY - DAY 5 70
Slim rings the doorbell of a very middle class home The

grass is pristine The windows are sparkling An American
flag blows in the wind

It’s safe to assume a soldier that came home with a purple
heart on his chest and a wounded heart behind it - lives
here

The door opens JOHNNY SHEPHERD is standing there He is that
soldier And he has the scars to prove it

MR SHEPHERD
Weve been expecting you

Before they walk in Slim notices a NOSEY NEIGHBOR peeking out
the window

CUT TO

THE SHEPHERDS sit on a couch across from Queen and Slim

MRS SHEPHERD is a college educated with views more
conservative than she’d like to admit

Mr Shepherd has just given them a devastating update

SLIM
What do you mean they killed him

MRS SHEPHERD
He shot a police officer in the
face

Slim is shaken to his core

SLIM
We were just with him

MR SHEPHERD
You knew the boy

QUEEN
We spent some time with him

MRS SHEPHERD
Did you order him to do it

Slim stands up He wants to strangle her

SLIM
Are you crazy

Queen grabs his arm and tries to calm him down

QUEEN
We would never do that

MRS SHEPHERD
These kids think it’s okay to kill
cops because of you

SLIM
Who made cops think it was okay to
kill us

QUEEN

We didn’t want this

MRS SHEPHERD
(to her husband)
There’s a war going on out there
and you’ve welcomed it into our
home

MR SHEPHERD
They didn’t start it

She cuts her eyes at his husband

MRS SHEPHERD
I want them gone by morning

SLIM
We can leave right now

Slim stands up

SLIM (CONTD)
Let’s go

This time Queen does as she’s told The roles have reversed
As they start for the door

MR SHEPHERD
Don’t let your pride get you
killed

SLIM
I ain’t staying here

MR SHEPHERD
I got secret hiding spots all over
this place Even if the cops come
here - they won’t be able to find
you

He thinks for a beat

QUEEN
Thank you

CUT TO

INT SHEPHERD HOME - DINING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT 572

The four sit at an old dining room table This is the most
unusual double date we’ve ever seen

But the room is peaceful The spread is something straight
out of the 1950s A protein A veggie And mashed potatoes
The only beverage available to drink is milk Whole milk

MRS SHEPHERD
There’s a bounty on your heads

SLIM
How much are we worth

MRS SHEPHERD

Two fifty

SLIM
Total

MRS SHEPHERD
Each

QUEEN
That ain’t much

MRS SHEPHERD
That could pay off our mortgage

QUEEN
You gon turn us in

MR SHEPHERD
No

Queen cuts her eyes at Mrs Shepherd

MR SHEPHERD (CONTD)
Earl told me you needed a plane

SLIM
Yeah

MR SHEPHERD
I know a guy I already gave him a
call

Mr Shepherd gets up from the table and grabs a notepad He
WRITES DOWN AN ADDRESS and hands it to Queen

MR SHEPHERD (CONTD)
Tell him I sent you

Queen slips it in her pocket

MRS SHEPHERD
We should eat before it gets cold

Everyone grabs hands and bows their heads

MR SHEPHERD
I’1ll lead us in a prayer

QUEEN
May I do it

MR SHEPHERD
Of course

Queen takes a deep breath She’s never done this before

QUEEN
Id like to start by thanking God
for the breath in my lungs And the
breath in the lungs of everyone at
this table I’m grateful we have a
place to sleep tonight and food to
put in our bellies Thank you for
bringing us this far Thank you for
this journey No matter how it
ends

SLIM
Amen
MR SHEPHERD MRS SHEPHERD
Amen Amen

Everyone starts to eat Queen looks up at Slim and notices
for the first time he’s not shoveling food into his mouth
He’s not chewing like a cow He’s taking his time and
savoring every bite This is a change he isn’t aware of but
she is Queen stares at him for a long beat and smiles

Then AN AGGRESSIVE VOICE COMING FROM OUTSIDE interrupts their
peaceful dinner

VOICE (0S)
The house is surrounded Come out
with your hands up

Mrs Shepherd looks like she’s about to piss herself Mr
Shepherd is no stranger to this type of situation He is calm
and collected

MR SHEPHERD
Okay I want you two to run
upstairs and go into the yellow
bedroom on the left Hide under the
bed

QUEEN
They’1ll find us there

MR SHEPHERD
There are loose panels under the
bed Hide under there and don’t
make a sound

QUEEN
Okay

MR SHEPHERD
Go Now

Queen and Slim run upstairs in search of the yellow bedroom
While Mr Shepherd quickly gets rid of Queen and Slim’s
plates to make it look like there were only two people
breaking bread instead of four

VOICE (0S)
You have three seconds to come out
or were coming in

Mr Shepherd grabs his wife’s trembling hand and walks her to
the front door

CUT TO

EXT SHEPHERD HOME - FRONT PORCH - NIGHT 5 73

Mr and Mrs Shepherd walk outside slowly with their hands
raised

The SWAT LEADER immediately starts searching them both Mrs
Shepherd dissolves into tears Mr Shepherd is stoic

MR SHEPHERD
Do you have a warrant
He holds one up

MR SHEPHERD (CONTD)
I want to read that

SWAT LEADER
Take all the time you need

Mr Shepherd reads the warrant carefully It’s legit

He nods at the police Then with the flick of a finger the
Swat Leader commands his team to enter the house

CUT TO

INT HOUSE - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - SECONDS LATER - NIGHT 5 74
They swarm the house like bees Tearing it apart
They break antiques and damage the wood floors

CUT TO

INT HOUSE - BEDROOM - SAME TIME - NIGHT 5 75

Queen and Slim make their way to the MASTER BEDROOM They try
to lift up the panels under the bed Some of them lift easily
while others are stuck and won’t budge Slim starts to sweat
bullets Queen does her best to loosen them up as fast as she
can

They move quickly - but they aren’t fast enough

Determined FOOTSTEPS make their way into the bedroom The
bedroom door SWINGS OPEN Silence

We follow the FEET looking in the closet and then out the
window to see if they jumped

Then we PAN UP to reveal the feet belong to the Swat Leader
that shoved a warrant in Mr Shepherd’s face

He stares at the bed and grins Then he lifts it up with one
quick swoop and -- Nothing They aren’t there

SWAT LEADER
Fuck

He lets go of the bed and it CRASHES against the floor

INT HOUSE - BEDROOM - UNDERNEATH THE FLOOR - SAME TIME - NS

Queen and Slim lay close together Shaking Trying not to
breathe

EXT HOUSE - FRONT LAWN - LATER - NIGHT 5 77

The Police are loading the bright red Cadillac that Queen and
Slim have called home - for most of their journey - onto a
tow truck

It’s evidence now The Shepherds are handcuffed and sitting
in the back seat of a Swat Truck The Swat Leader from before
looks down at them
SWAT LEADER

If you tell me where they’re going

we can let you go and you can enjoy

the rest of your evening
Mrs Shepherd looks at her husband

MR SHEPHERD
We don’t know where they’re going

He kneels down and gets in Mrs Shepherd’s face
SWAT LEADER
How bout you You look a lot
smarter than your husband

As we linger on her face we --

CUT TO

INT HOUSE - BEDROOM - UNDERNEATH THE FLOOR - HOURS LATER
DAY 6

Queen and Slim are half asleep She turns to him

QUEEN
We have to leave at some point

SLIM
I’m not tryna walk into an ambush

QUEEN
I heard cars leave hours ago

SLIM
I’m sure they left some folks
behind to keep an eye on the house

QUEEN
You can stay and die of starvation
if you want to - but I’m getting
the fuck outta here

Queen lifts the panels up one by one They both take in the
fresh air They roll from up under the bed

INT EXT SHEPHERD HOME - BEDROOM BACKYARD - DAY 6 79

Queen walks over to the window that faces the back of the
house All that’s back there is a GARAGE and a small
backyard Queen lifts up the window and looks down

It’s low enough so they can’t kill themselves but high
enough that they could break a leg if they landed wrong

QUEEN
We gotta jump

Slim looks out

SLIM
It’s too high

QUEEN
All you have to do is bend your
knees as soon as you hit the
ground Bend and roll

SLIM
This ain’t no damn fire drill

Queen climbs onto the window seal takes a deep breath and
JUMPS out of the window But she doesn’t take her own advice
and forgets to bend her knees

She hits the ground HARD and lands flat on her back knocking
the wind out of her body and her LEFT SHOULDER OUT OF ITS
SOCKET Queen grabs her arm and rocks back and forth trying
not to scream She’s in excruciating pain

SLIM (CONTD)
Fuck

Seeing Queen in pain is the push he needed He walks back a
few feet and runs toward the window LEAPING to the ground He
follows Queen’s instructions and lands perfectly

Rather than rejoicing he rushes over to Queen’s aid and pulls
her into the garage

INT GARAGE - CONTINUOUS - DAY 6 80
Queen is in so much pain she can’t speak
SLIM
Okay I know how to do this But
you have to promise not to scream
Can you do that

She shakes her head no

SLIM (CONTD)
I believe in you

She continues to shake her head and backs away from him
SLIM (CONTD)
I think there are cops out front
and if they hear you - it’s over
We’re done I know how strong you
are

Those words give her the strength she needs

QUEEN
Give me your shirt

He takes it off and balls it up She stuffs it in her mouth
and gives him a nod to let him know she’s ready

Slim grabs her elbow with one hand and grasps her neck with
the other

SLIM
1 2

Then YANK She SCREAMS but it’s muffled by his shirt

CUT TO

EXT FRONT OF THE HOUSE - SAME TIME - DAY 6 81
Two POLICE OFFICERS are standing guard out front Police
Officer 1 is out of shape and always in a good mood Police
Officer 2 is too intense for his own good

Police Officer 1 hears Queen’s muffled groans

POLICE OFFICER 1
Did you hear that

POLICE OFFICER 2
Hear what

POLICE OFFICER 1
It sounds like somebody’s crying

POLICE OFFICER 2
No it’s just nature You city boys
aint used to that shit

POLICE OFFICER 1
Don’t refer to me as a boy

POLICE OFFICER 2
You know what I meant

POLICE OFFICER 1
Look I know the difference between
a person and an animal

POLICE OFFICER 2
Then go walk around

POLICE OFFICER 1
Man watch how you talk to me

POLICE OFFICER 2
Touchy touchy

Police Officer 1 starts to walk around the property

CUT TO

INT GARAGE - SAME TIME - DAY 6 82

Queen rubs her shoulder - still in pain While Slim searches
for a key to the STATION WAGON parked in the garage

SLIM
Help me find a screwdriver

They both start searching

QUEEN
You know how to jumpstart a car

SLIM
I used to My older brother taught
me one summer

QUEEN
I didn’t know you had a brother

SLIM
Yup

They lock eyes for a second - realizing there’s so much about
each other they may never know

Then Queen finds an old toolbox Slim digs through it

SLIM (CONTD)
The only car we ever jump started
was my dad’s He used to take his
keys with him everywhere he went
He knew better than to leave that
Acura around us

QUEEN
I see why

Slim finally finds what he’s looking for and hops in the
driver’s seat Queen gets in the passenger This is a far cry
from Uncle Earl’s fly caddy But they’1ll take what they can
get

Slim tries to convince the ignition the screwdriver is a key
but it doesn’t work

SLIM
Dammit

He takes it out and tries again Nothing

CUT TO

EXT SIDE OF THE HOUSE - SAME TIME - DAY 6 83
Police Officer 1 walks around looking to see if anyone’s
there He sees the garage But doesn’t hear anything He
cocks his gun and walks over to the garage

CUT TO

INT GARAGE - SAME TIME - DAY 6 84

Queen digs through the toolbox again and finds a smaller
screwdriver and gives him that

Slim puts that in the ignition and it works The engine is
louder than they thought it would be

SLIM
Now how we supposed to get outta
here

Before she can answer

POLICE OFFICER 1 LIFTS UP THE GARAGE DOOR

They turn to look at him They’re caught

The Police Officer looks around and realizes his colleagues
are out front - chatting with each other He looks back at
Queen and Slim and sees two faces that remind him of his own
He remembers why he became a cop To help people And at the
moment no one needs his help more than the two people in
front of him

They have a staring contest for about three seconds

Then he takes a few steps back and gives them room to back
up

Slim puts the car in reverse and moves the car back slowly
Queen sinks low into her seat

Police Officer 1 nods his head as a way to say “go head”
They pull off and drive onto a SECLUDED side street

And just like that they’re on the road again

Police Officer 1 watches them go Confident in his decision
He walks back around to the front of the house

INT FRONT OF THE HOUSE - CONTINUOUS - DAY 6 85

POLICE OFFICER 2
What was it

POLICE OFFICER 1
A couple deer got caught in some
branches I set ‘em free

POLICE OFFICER 2
Told you

As Police Officer 1 grins we --

CUT TO

INT STATION WAGON - HOURS LATER - DAY 6 86

They’re almost in Miami

Queen sticks her head out the window and lets the wind hit
her face For the first time in her life she feels completely
free No fear

SLIM
What you doing

She doesn’t respond Queen unbuckles her seatbelt and hoists
herself up onto the window sill and leans on the roof of the
car

SLIM (CONTD)
Are you crazy Get back in the
car

She looks up at the sky The stars seem bigger to her Queen
takes a deep breath - then gets back in her seat

SLIM (CONTD)
Are you tryna get caught

QUEEN
No I just always wanted to do
that
SLIM
Well don’t do it while I’m
driving
QUEEN
You should try it
SLIM
Nah I’m good
QUEEN
Pull over
SLIM

No

She grabs the steering wheel and YANKS it to the left They
almost crash into another car

SLIM (CONTD)
If I do it will you please let me
drive the rest of the way in peace

QUEEN
Swear to God

SLIM
Swear on something you believe in

QUEEN
Okay fine I’1ll swear on you
And just like that a wave of freedom washes over Slim
She kisses him As he pulls over we --

CUT TO

INT STATION WAGON - MOMENTS LATER - DAY 6 87

Queen gripping the steering wheel while Slim tries to hoist
himself up and out of the car window He’s not as graceful as
she is

He finally gets up there and tries to hold onto the roof of
the car but his hands are sweaty so he loses his grip and
FALLS BACK - with his arms flailing in the air

QUEEN
Oh shit

Before he flies out of the car he grabs a hold of the
rearview mirror and regains his balance

SLIM
Fuck this I’m coming back in

QUEEN
No you got it You’re good I’1l
drive slow

She slows down a bit and Slim finally gets a firm hold of the
roof

Queen picks up a little speed and Slim gets a whiff of the
freedom she just got Slim doesn’t know if he’ll ever feel
this free again - so he cherishes the moment

CUT TO

INT STATION WAGON - NIGHT 6 88

Queen and Slim are parked in an empty field - somewhere in
Miami

It looks like an abandoned plantation

QUEEN
Are you sure this is the address

Slim gets out of the car and looks around There’s no sign of

human life anywhere

QUEEN (CONTD)
Will you please just get back in
the car before you get shot

SLIM
Ain’t nobody out here

Slim gets back in the car They’re both exhausted from
driving all day

SLIM (CONTD)
I was hoping we’d pull up toa
house so we could get some sleep

QUEEN
Well there isn’t one

SLIM
I can see that

QUEEN
They’re gonna find us

SLIM
No they’re not

Queen shakes her head

SLIM (CONTD)
How about you get in the back and
get some sleep and I’1l sit up here
and make sure nobody kills us

She gets out of the car and climbs in the back

The backseat is practically a bed anyway Slim takes off his
jacket and places it behind her head from the front seat

Queen curls up in a ball and closes her eyes Slim stares off
into the night While he looks up at the stars he hears --

QUEEN
I can’t sleep

SLIM
You want me to turn on the radio

QUEEN
No I want you to tell me a story

He turns to look at her Confused and annoyed

SLIM
What kind of story

QUEEN
Any story I don’t care

He fidgets with his hands as he begins to speak

SLIM
When I was little I asked my mom
where babies come from She said I
was too young to know So I went
asked my dad He said babies are
the product of two people that
needed something from each other I
didn’t know what that meant So I
said -- needed what He said maybe
they needed to feel seen Maybe
they needed to feel loved Maybe
they needed to feel human

QUEEN
And then what

SLIM
Then I asked my grandmother and she
said -- babies come from God
They’re His way of making sure no
one ever really dies I remember
her saying “through our children we
are reborn”

Queen smiles

SLIM (CONTD)
Then I went to my older brother and
asked him and he said nobody
knows You’re just born That’s it
Now leave me alone

Slim chuckles at the memory

SLIM (CONTD)
I wasn’t satisfied with that answer
either but I’d run out of family
members to ask - so he got the last
word

QUEEN
So whose right

Tears well up in Slim’s eyes He wonders if he’1ll ever see
them again

SLIM
None of ‘em Babies come from
fucking Plain and simple
They both chuckle

Then Queen’s eyelids become heavy She eventually closes her
eyes and falls asleep

Slim stares at her Grinning Watching her sleep has quickly
become one of his favorite pastimes After a moment he finds
it hard to keep his eyes open as well

Soon - they’re both fast asleep In a station wagon In the
middle of a field Somewhere in Florida

CUT TO

INT STATION WAGON - DAY 7 (DAWN) 89
Slim is in a deep sleep Mouth open Head tilted
Then we hear - CLICK CLACK Slim JOLTS awake

There’s a RIFLE aimed at Slim’s face Once his brain computes
what’s happening he scoots over into the drivers seat - this
causes Queen to wake up too

QUEEN
What’s going on

She looks at the man holding the rifle He’s a BLACK MAN with
a scruffy BEARD and inquisitive eyes

He’s wearing an oversized white t-shirt and his teeth are
covered in 14 karat GOLD grillz

Queen and Slim aren’t sure if they should feel anxious or at
ease

BLACK MAN
Why y’all acting all scared and
shit

SLIM
Cause you pointing a gun at my
face

He joyfully swings it over his shoulder

BLACK MAN
Oh I’m just fucking wit you playa

He opens the door on the drivers side Slim gets out
cautiously

SLIM
You know the Shepherds
BLACK MAN
Hell yeah
QUEEN

BLACK MAN

Queen looks skeptical

BLACK MAN (CONTD)

Look y’all can either roll with me

CUT TO

INT TRAILER - MOMENTS LATER - DAY 7 90

Queen and Slim sit in the Black Man’s tiny trailer He’s

BLACK MAN (CONTD)

Queen reaches forward and grabs the blunt out of the Bearded
Black Man’s hand She takes a huge hit As she blows it out --

BLACK MAN (CONTD)
I knew you wanted to hit that shit

They all laugh

BLACK MAN (CONTD)
Live yo life sis

Then she passes it to Slim Nudging him to do it He waves
her away at first

QUEEN
Come on For me

That does it Slim takes the blunt and hits it a little too
hard They both laugh at him

Then the Bearded Black Man looks out the window and sees a
small PLANE up ahead

BLACK MAN
There that nigga go

EXT PLANE - DAY 7 92

It’s the kind of plane famous people get on to die He pulls
up along side it Queen and Slim hop out

They both shake his hand with gratitude

BLACK MAN
Power to the muthafucking people

Queen grabs Slim’s hand and they both start walking toward
the plane

It’s been a long road to this point They’re ready to leave
it all behind Then --

They can hear HELICOPTERS floating above them They both look
up Fuck

They turn around to find FIVE SQUAD CARS lined up
TWO COPS step out of each vehicle GUNS DRAWN

The Bearded Black Man with the kind eyes was a Judas after
all

One of the Police Officers gets on the bullhorn

POLICE OFFICER
Get on the ground now Put your
hands behind your head

Queen and Slim look at each other Never letting go of each
other’s hand

POLICE OFFICER (CONTD)
Get on the ground now

QUEEN
There’s no getting out of this is
there

Slim says “no” with his eyes

Queen looks up at the sky - and somehow manages to muster a
smile

QUEEN (CONTD)
Well I’m not letting go of your
hand

SLIM
If I had the chance I would’ve
kissed all your scars

QUEEN
I know you would have
Queen looks at him with tears in her eyes

QUEEN (CONTD)
Can I be your legacy

SLIM
You already --

BOOM

A BULLET - traveling faster than the speed of light - pierces
through Queen’s chest Causing her body to DROP

And just like that a complex beauty with beautiful brown
skin and a tortured past is gone

Slim kneels down and takes her in his arms He stands up
holding her lifeless body

With tears streaming down his face he walks toward the police
slowly and deliberately The police are stunned and confused

What the fuck is he doing
It doesn’t matter All we know is his death is imminent

POLICE OFFICER
Stop walking

He doesn’t

POLICE OFFICER (CONTD)
Put your hands up now

He doesn’t

POLICE OFFICER (CONTD)
Stop or well shoot

He keeps walking Defiantly
Then -- BOOM BOOM

Two bullets BLOW through his chest He plummets to the
ground Never letting go of her

He died just as he had lived - with pride and a quiet
dignity

They both lay there on the pavement In a pool of their own
blood Their bodies making an unintentional cross

The COPS put their guns down Feeling powerful and guilty at
the same time It’s an adrenaline rush they can’t describe

The Police Officers look at Queen and Slim’s dead bodies
Observing them Not unlike a hunter observes his prey

INT VARIOUS LOCATIONS - DAY 7 93

We see thousands of people glued to their TV and iPhone
screens as they watch what just took place This is public
theater

It’s like the OJ Simpson verdict all over again Only this
time black people are on the losing end

NEWS ANCHOR (VO)
Angela Johnson and Ernest Hinds
were shot and killed today by Miami
Police The two suspects have
become quite infamous for their
ability to escape authorities after
killing a police officer four days
ago in Columbus Ohio Miami Police
Department released a statement
saying they hoped to arrest the
suspects so the they could have
their day in court but they had no
choice but to open fire

We’ll see THE SHEPHERDS watching from home Mrs Shepherd
watches with conflicted eyes Mr Shepherd has to look away

Well see GODDESS and NAOMI watching on their phones in
Earl’s overcrowded house Earl smokes a cigarette and
pretends to be unfazed But he is He’s never felt more alone
in the world than he does right now

Well see Junior’s father watching from his shop He doesn’t
have much space to mourn other people’s children when he’s
still mourning his own

Finally - we’ll see the Bearded Black Man watching He sits
in his trailer with a blunt dangling from his lips while
counting his reward money We’ll search for remorse behind
his eyes but we won’t find it

The floor is covered in blood and water

The CORONER is a dignified black man with salt and pepper
hair

He washes Queen and Slim’s bodies as if they were his

He does it in a voice low enough so he won’t get in trouble
but loud enough so God will hear him

EXT OHIO STREET - THREE DAYS LATER - DAY 9 95

HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE mostly Black and Latino stand in the
streets holding flowers with sad eyes They pour into the
streets to pay their respects to two ordinary people that
became sacrificial lambs

It’s reminiscent of BIGGIE’S funeral Only this time there’s
no music being played from boom boxes There’s no animation
or joy to be found

We see Slim’s beloved father in the crowd He bows his head
and takes off his hat as his son’s casket rolls by

Slim’s family consists of his OLDER BROTHER his ELEGANT
MOTHER and HIS BROTHER’S CHILDREN - two nephews and one
niece

The only person there to grieve QUEEN is Earl He cries
uncontrollably as he reaches out to touch her casket It’s
covered in white hydrangeas Her favorite

EXT STREET - DAY 9 97

FIVE LITTLE BLACK BOYS run through an apartment complex
They’re making their way to a basketball court

As they play - we notice one of the boys is wearing a t-shirt
with Queen and Slim’s faces on it

And just like that they’ve gone from skin and bones to
mythical beings that everyone wishes they knew

Heroes that everyone admires and young people will emulate
for generations to come

Whether you call them sacrificial lambs revolutionaries or
just two innocent people that defended themselves -- their
names will live on forever

But for the purposes of this story -- they will always be
known as Queen and Slim
