EXT LITTLE LEAGUE FIELD - AERIAL

We DRIFT over a scene of Saturday afternocn Americana
Little League baseball game and cookout at the town PtErD of

a peaceful suburban community-

GROUND LEVEL - PICNIC AREA

A DAD in a grease-spattered apron flips steaks burgers and
dogs on the grill with a long-handled fork-

PARKING LOT - YAPPY DOG

A little YAPPY DOG scoots around BARKING with apoplectic fury
at the end of its leash secured to gardening stake whacked
into the ground at the edge of the parking lot-

BLEACHERS
PARENTS CHEER their children on-

JOSHUA‘S MOTHER
Come on Joshua rip the cover off
the ball

TIMMY’S FATHER
Buckle down fellas On your toes
out there

Joshua’s mother sits with little REBECCA no more than two or
three years old standing on the bleacher seats beside her
and her bespectacled son BENJAMIN immersed in a Harry Potter
book on the other side Behind her is a VIDEO ENTHUSIAST
parent recording everything with a high-end VIDEO CAMERA-

JOSHUAS MOTHER
Come on honey lay into it
(nudging Benjamin) Benjamin stop
reading your brothers up-

BENJAMIN
I’m aware of that Mother

We PAN to the FIELD just as JOSHUA swings and hits a grounder
between first and second-

JOSHUAS MOTHER
Run Run Run
RIGHT FIELD

The ball continues into RIGHT FIELD where little TIMMY not
major league material lets it roll between his legs turns
and kicks it a few times before finally picking it up and
launching an anemic throw toward the infield to the chorus

of-

TEAMMATES
Throw it Throw the ball Throw

it

INFIELD

The ball is retrieved by the first baseman who hurls it to
the shortstop covering second but Joshua is already standing
happily on top of the bag The PITCHER is furious yelling

out to Timmy-

PITCHER
All you got to do is pick it up and
throw it You’re such a spaz

COACH (0S)
Hey none of that

We PAN to see the COACH standing in front of the BENCH of the
team in the field-

COACH
I‘ll handle the coaching here

PITCHER
Do we have to have him out there

COACH
Just get back on the mound Mister

The Pitcher kicks the dirt and returns to the mound as the
Coach turns angrily to Timmy-

COACH
Keep your head down on those
grounders and throw ahead of the
runner You‘re out there pickin
daisies

BLEACHERS

Timmy‘s father puts his head in his hands humiliated-
O)

JOSHUAS MOTHER
He got a double

BENJAMIN
(still reading) A single and an
error

PITCHER’S FATHER
That kid in right couldn’t catch a
cold in flu season

JOSHUAS MOTHER
Come on Eli bring him in

RIGHT FIELD

Timmy dejectedly walks back to his position
sweeps over him-

PARKING LOT - YAPPY DOG

A large SHADOW

Yappy Dog is yapping yapping then senses something above

and freezes looking up

BLEACHERS

He starts to WHIMPER-

Little Rebecca is looking up into the sky fascinated-

RIGHT FIELD

Timmy unsteadily wobbles under the pop-up everyone on and
off the field SHOUTING instructions at him-

SKY - BASEBALL

The baseball keeps rising rising- FWOOSH A huge black
PTEROSAUR swoops out of the heights and snatches the ball in
its razor-toothed bill then wings away with powerful
strokes

TIMMY

Frozen in amazement glove still ready for the ball that
wont be coming down for him to drop-

BLEACHERS

The SPECTATORS are stunned speechless gaping up at the sky
Little Rebecca giggles-

REBECCA

FWAP Another PTEROSAUR swoops down from behind and snatches
the steak off his fork

BARBECUE DAD
Hey

BLEACHERS

We shoot from behind the bleachers toward the field and the
sky above it A BLACK SHAPE takes form winging in over the
fence in center field-

REVERSE
The Spectators are standing up concerned-

JOSHUAS MOTHER
(pointing) Look Up in the sky
It’s a- a-

BENJAMIN
(interested now) It’s some sort of
pterosaur Mother

JOSHUAS MOTHER
IT’S COMING AT US

Joshuas Mother grabs little Rebecca and ducks with all the
Spectators as the PTEROSAUR buzzes the bleachers SQUAWKING
with menace Only the Video Enthusiast and Benjamin remain

standing-

BENJAMIN
There’s a whole flock of them
though ‘flock’ might not be the
right word-

Joshua’s Mother grabs his arm and yanks him down turns
screaming to the field-

JOSHUAS MOTHER
Joshua run Run

FIELD

It locks like a WWI degfight over the infield a half-dozen
PTEROSAURS wheeling and swooping SQUAWKING hellaciously the
LITTLE LEAGUERS scrambling in all directions-

JOSHUA

Joshua begins to run down the basepath towards third a
PTEROSAUR flapping after him As he rounds third the beast
makes a lunge narrowly missing the boy with its talons
Joshua sprints toward home plate and his mother in the
bleachers beyond the pterosaur wheeling and pursuing-

JOSHUAS MOTHER
Standing with her daughter in arms now screaming out-
JOSHUA‘’S MOTHER
Run Joshua run Slide
JOSHUA
Just as the PTEROSAUR makes another snatch for him Joshua
slides under its grasp and across home plate The pterosaur

streaks past busting partially through the nylon mesh of the
backstop SQUAWKING and struggling as it becomes entangled-

PARKING LOT - AERIAL SHOT

We SWOOP down from above at the no longer yapping Yappy Dog-

DOG

The dog WHIMPERS takes a hard run- THOONK and pulls the
stake clear out of the ground scampering away with it
trailing him till- FWACK the swooping PTEROSAUR scoops it up
and swallows it flapping away with the leash and stake
dangling from its bill

PICNIC AREA

FAMILY MEMBERS running every whichway as they are dive—bombed
by PTEROSAURS-

A PTEROSAUR crouches on a blanket on the ground wolfing down
the abandoned picnic food-

Barbecue Dad fends one flying menace eff with his long fork
then dives under a PICNIC TABLE for refuge-

FIELD

General panic on the field The Pitcher has been standing
petrified on the mound throughout too scared to run or even
lie down-

His Father is starting out to him from the sidelines much
impeded by swooping SQUAWKING PTEROSAURS-

PITCHER’S FATHER
Just stay right there Alex Im
coming for you

But a PTEROSAUR does a Stuka-dive over the backstop and FWAP
grabs the boy by the shoulders lifting him away-

PITCHERS FATHER
NO

The flying beast flaps hard trying to get some altitude
lugging the Pitcher only a few feet off the ground as it
heads straight toward Timmy in right field

Timmys Father is running out toward him aluminum BASEBALL
BAT in hand-

TIMMY S FATHER
Grab him Timmy Grab him

TIMMY

Timmy pulls his glove off estimates then jumps just as the
PTEROSAUR is starting to lift off grabbing the Pitchers
legs with both arms The extra weight pulls the beast down
close enough to the ground that WHAP WHAP WHAP Timmys
father can start whomping it with the bat The pterosaur
lets the Pitcher go he and Timmy tumbling to the ground
then flaps away CROAKING a DISTRESS CALL-

The Pitcher’s father and Timmy’s father help the boys up-
TIMMY ‘S FATHER

Nice grab son Way to use your
head

The VIDEO ENTHUSIAST steps past them pointing his camera to

the sky-

VIDEO ENTHUSIAST
I think thev’re leaving

We PAN to see what he’s taping- a PHALANX of PTERCSAURS
winging away together-

INFIELD

We TRACK through freaked-out Little Leaguers and their
freaked-out parents trying to comfort them till we reach
home plate where Joshua’s Mother is on her knees hugging
Joshua as little Rebecca and Benjamin stand by-

JOSHUA‘’S MOTHER
Oh Joshua that was wonderful
You were so brave

BENJAMIN
He didn’t touch third

She gives her bookworm son a withering look-

JOSHUAS MOTHER
This is the last baseball game I
take you to young man

BENJAMIN
(brightening) Promise

BACKSTOP

The thoroughly enmeshed PTEROSAUR caught in the backstop
netting SCREAMS in frustration-

INT BEACH BAR - DAY - CU TELEVISION SCREEN

We start on a TV NEWS image of the struggling PTEROSAUR
wrapped in cut-away backstop netting and with a plastic
RESTRAINT holding its bill shut being carefully carried past
shell-shocked LITTLE LEAGUERS and PARENTS by a pair of black-
uniformed SWAT TEAM members—

Similar incidents have plagued
communities in Central America and

We believe that these current
depredations-—
REVERSE - NICK

NICK HARRIS a currently unemployed soldier of fortune
watches the TV sceptically as he stands at the counter of a

BEACHFRONT BAR-

SPEILER (TV)
-can be attributed to animals that
escaped the island before we at
Grendel took possession of it

Harris pushes aside his empty whiskey glass and steps away-

NICK
Right buddy-
SPEILER (V0O)
We can only regret that we were not

given the opportunity to respond to
this situation earlier

EXT BEACHFRONT BARBOARDWALK - DAY
Harris squints as the sun hits him He has a day-old stubble
on his face and the air of a man whos unhappily killing

time We TRACK with him as he moves down the BOARDWALK past
various BEACH TYPES A SHADOW drifts over him He looks up-

JEB OVERTON wearing a quasi-military UNIFORM approaches
Nick with a halting gait-

OVERTON
Its you right

Nick looks him over smiles slightly-

NICK
Captain Overton
OVERTON
(embarrassed) JI look more like
Captain Crunch in this outfit I
haven’t seen you since--

ll

He doesn’t finish the sentence The place they last saw each

other is not one either wishes to reminisce about-

NICK
Yeah

OVERTON
Have you heard from any of the
guys

NICK
Haven’t been in the loop for a
while

OVERTON

Wilkens drove his car off a cliff
DeStefano-- well peacetime is
rough for a lot of people

NICK
How bout you

OVERTON
Oh I’m the bionic security guard

He hitches up his pants slightly to reveal his ankles-
CHROMIUM prosthetics

Both legs are artificial below the knees-

OVERTON
State of the art I’m in charge of
the lock-up over at the aviary-

He indicates the large HUMMINGBIRD PATCH on the breast
of his uniform-

OVERTON
-this like giant zoo for birds-

NICK
I always said you were for the
birds

OVERTON
(grins) Listen are you still-
consulting

NICK
(grim) Havent had a contract in

three years

OVERTON
But if there was one good money a
little travel a little adventure-

NICK
You’ve been looking for me

OVERTON
More or less

Harris looks out over the beach Lots of people having fun-

NICK
It’s not exactly a stepping-stone
to bigger and better things what
we do is it

He sighs resigned-

NICK
Whos it for

OVERTON
Well- he’s kind of strange-

EXT AVIARY - DAY - EMU

An EMU faces us in threat posture the big flightless bird
making a deep THUMPING noise as it vibrates its massive chest-

JOHN HAMMOND (0S)
They can get rather territorial in

captivity

REVERSE

Nick and JOHN HAMMOND stroll down a pathway through a section
of high grass in the AVIARY High above them is a domed
CEILING of net all around are outcroppings of foliage and
busy BIRDS A sturdy NURSE follows them several yards behind-

JOHN HAMMOND
Of course it doesn’t put me in the
best of moods either

NICK
You’re not in captivity
é Hemmond shoots a quick look back to the nurse-

JOHN HAMMOND
You just cant see the chains My
late heir managed to get me
declared incompetent my minders
are bribed to spy upon me for my
enemies-—

NICK
You have enemies

JOHN HAMMOND
Did you know that I am the most-
sued person in the history of the
world It’s in the Guinness Book
you could look it up Prominent
law schools devote entire semesters
to my malfeasances regulatory
statutes bear my name- not the
legacy I had in mind when I started
out but a legacy nonetheless

They pass some beautiful ROSEATE SPOONBILLS wading through a
shallow pond-
Meter
JOHN HAMMOND

We look back at our lives and we
try to tally up the things we are
proud of against the regrets-- do
you have regrets Mr Harris

NICK
(nods) More than a few

JOHN HAMMOND
At the moment my greatest regret
other than having spawned the
careers of thousands of tort
lawyers is having put an evil into
the world that may become permanent—
an evil that must be eliminated
before it spirals out of control

NICK
Your dinosaurs

JOHN HAMMOND
(smiles) Yes My dinosaurs How
much do you know about them

NICK
(shrugs) Most of them have been
wiped out A couple species have
been making a nuigance of
themselves-

JOHN HAMMOND
Whenever a new organism especially
a predator with no natural enemies
is introduced into an ecosystem
the result is disastrous

NICK
Pest control isn’t in my line-

JOHN HAMMOND
I’m not proposing you run about
with a butterfly net Mr Harris
The most effective weapon against
any species is its own behavior-
particularly its reproductive
behavior Take a population of any
wild animal and introduce a number
of highly aggressive but
reproductively-neutered individuals

‘within it- a ‘Judas strain’ so to

speak-

NICK
Cuts down on the birth rate

JOHN HAMMOND
Who better to locate our errant
creatures than their almost
identical kin-

NICK
Why not give them diseases too

JOHN HAMMOND
Viruses mutate faster than
lawsuits I’m afraid Too much
risk theyd begin to affect other
species But a large influx of
young aggressive sterile but
sexually attractive females-

NICK
Sounds like a college boy’s dream-

JOHN HAMMOND
And the only solution I believe
to our present crisis

NICK

Sounds good to me

JOHN HAMMOND
But not to the United Nations
They’ve laughed off my proposals
outlawed not only the creation of
any new dinosaurs sterile or not
but also prohibited the world-wide
mining sale or possession of amber-

NICK
No little mosquitoes trapped in
tree sap-

JOHN HAMMOND
-means no basic genetic material to

work with

NICK
But even if you had these genes
you couldn’‘t-

JOHN HAMMOND
Among the people on the board of
this aviary funded through a trust
I set up before my legal
difficulties began are some of the
finest genetic scientists in the
world People who would be happy
to risk implementing my plan- if a
source of the vital DNA could be

located

NICK
Something tells me youve found
one

JOHN HAMMOND
I didn’t find it I left it behind
A former employee of mine a Mr
Nedry-

INT JURASSIC PARK LABORATORY - FLASHBACK

We see NEDRY opening a safety vault disguised as an AEROSOL
CAN and sticking pilfered tubes of dinosaur embryo into it-

e

JOHN HAMMOND (VC)
-at the behest of one of my more
unscrupulous competitors conspired
to steal a large quantity of
genetic material enough to
engender at least forty species
from our laboratory at the Park
It was his misfortune however-

EXT ROAD - ISLA NUBLAR - RAINY NIGHT - FLASHBACK

Nedry’s vehicle slides out of control in the torrential
downpour leaving the road and coming to rest stuck in the
muck-

JOHN HAMMOND (VO)
-to attempt this clandestine
transaction during a- a period a
severe technical malfunction at the
facility

EXT JUNGLE - NIGHT - FLASHBACK

Nedry faces off with a large curious Chlamydosaurus Sputori
(‘spitting frilled lizard or ‘Spitter’) Its FRILLS pop up
and it HAWKS a throatful of nasty black stuff into Nedrys
face-

JOHN HAMMOND (VO)
We were forced to abandon the
island before his exact fate-

Nedry runs back into his vehicle but the SPITTER leaps in
after him Thrashing BLOOD-

JOHN HAMMOND (VO)
-or that of the material he had
stolen could be determined

We PAN to the abandoned aerosol can swept away by a rivulet
of rainwater and quickly covered with muck-

EXT AVIARY - DAY - PRESENT

SONGBIRDS flit about in the branches all around them as they
approach the rustic-built SNACK BAR-

NICK
But the people who took over the
island-
‘e

JOHN HAMMOND
Grendel International If they had
found it they wouldn’t be
constantly pressuring me to reveal
its whereabouts I have good
reason to believe they might be the
people who engaged Nedry in his
betrayal

NICK
Why would they want dinosaur genes

JOHN HAMMOND
I shudder to think

Hammond looks over the menu hanging above the snack bar
counter-

JOHN HAMMOND
Major Overton tells me youre an
expert in covert operations

NICK
I was trained as a Navy Seal Ive
been involved in- missions in and
out of uniform

JOHN HAMMOND
We know the sector Nedry was in
when he disappeared The stolen
material seems to have been hidden
in an aerosol can of some sort-

NICK
Deodorant

JOHN HAMMOND
Given the state of Nedry’s personal
hygiene I doubt it We can
provide you with a map-

NICK
There arent any dinosaurs left on
the island

JOHN HAMMOND
Grendel International claim to have-
restored equilibrium They
maintain a small security force
there to discourage trespassers-—

NICK
So I go there and I steal this-

©

JOHN HAMMOND

Reclaim-

NICK
I bring this can of DNA back to
you

COHN HAMMOND
Captain Overton will be your
contact

Hammond scribbles a number on a snack bar order pad flashes
it to Nick all the time wary of the approaching nurse We
see lots of zeros-

JOHN HAMMOND
You will be amply rewarded for your
risk of course with a generous
bonus if you succeed So

Nick considers nods resigned-

NICK
I‘ve done worse for less

JOHN HAMMOND
(beaming) Excellent Now- would
you care for a sundae

EXT ISLA NUBLAR - DAY

We start with an AERIAL SHOT of Isla Nublar in the distance
across the water then TILT DOWN to see a small local FISHING

BOAT in the FG-

FISHING BOAT

Overton is there checking a GPS instrument as the boats
owner RAMIREZ deals with a NET thrown over the side facing
the island-

OVERTON
This is the legal limit There’s a
couple patrol boats well hear from
if we drift any closer

We PAN to see Nick sitting on the deck beside the cabin
(which blocks him from view from the island) and pulling on
the last of his black SCUBA GEAR-

NICK
Give me ten minutes and then pull
out You sure about this pilot

OVERTON
Theyre used to seeing his plane
around the coast Eco-tours

Nick nods and pushes a camouflaged RAFT full of supplies
overboard clipping a nylon line attached to it to the back
of his belt Ramirez comes over to watch as Nick lowers his
mask and sits backwards eon the gunwale-

RAMIREZ
Buena suerte Senor

Nick nods falls backward into the water and disappears
They watch the raft begin to pull away Ramirez crosses

himself-

RAMIREZ
Que Dios le proteja

EXT BEACH - ISLA NUBLAR

The BEACH looks inviting- gentle waves strip of white sand
a fringe of palm trees little CRABS scuttling among the
fallen coconuts Suddenly Nick sits up in the surf quickly
pulling off his flippers and mask and hustling across the
sand to the shelter of the palms dragging the supply raft
behind him-

PALMS

Very precise very Mission Impossible Nick strips off the
wet suit opens the raft supply compartment Boots on
backpack GPS UNIT and LAMINATED MAP on a lanyard over his
neck then the weapons- automatic combat SHOTGUN small PACK
RIFLE with silencer 50-caliber PISTOL in one holster and
cell phone in the other-

Nick crouches sticks a HOMING DEVICE as yet unarmed into
the sand at the edge of the tree-line He trots off into the

jungle-

EXT JUNGLE - PATH - DAY

Nick moves quickly down an extremely overgrown PATHWAY
passing oddly-canted LAMP POSTS and torn rusted sections of
metal FENCING

This used to be the tourist track through the park He stops
abruptly listens- the usual Tarzan-movie JUNGLE SOUNDS
nothing you couldn’t hear on vacation He checks his GPS
then trots away

We HOLD then TILT UP the nearby LAMP POST to see a
SURVEILLANCE CAMERA mounted near the top swivelling to
follow Nicks movement-

JUNGLE

We shoot from GROUND LEVEL as Nick approaches from some
distance vaulting over a HOLE at the base of a gnarly-rooted

tree

We HOLD on the hole for a moment A large black four-
fingered REPTILE HAND emerges CLAWS gripping the earth

CLEARING

Nick is off the pathway now moving through thick jungle till
he reaches a small CLEARING He checks his map and GPS He
sees something climbs a slight rise pushes away some tall
weeds An abandoned rusted-out 4-wheel-drive VEHICLE Nick

yanks a torn flap of canvas away to reveal-

Nedry’s SKELETON Bony fingers still clutching the steering
wheel A SMALL LIZARD scuttles out through one of the eye
sockets in the SKULL-

NICK
(regarding skeleton) Looks like
youve dropped a few pounds

He rapidly searches the interior of the vehicle- seats
floor glove compartment- nothing but a FLASHLIGHT and a lot
of old CANDY WRAPPERS He steps away surveying the ground
around him-

BACKPACK

The backpack thumps to the ground Nick upzips it and pulls
out pieces of a disassembled METAL DETECTOR An ANIMAL
SCREAM from back in the trees- Nick listens Quiet again
He glances at his watch begins to assemble the metal
detector-

GROUND - LATER

We see the metal detector disc sweeping over the ground-
WIDER

Nick T-shirt soaked through with sweat has set up a GRID
with wooden stakes and string He is working a section
several yards down from the vehicle at the edge of a shallow
little STREAM He pauses wipes sweat off his forehead On
a whim he reaches the detector arm over the string and passes
the disc over a little mud-bar in the center of the stream

The machine CRACKLES

Nick drops the detector and jumps into the stream digging
furiously at the mud-bar with his hands He stops feeling
something then pulls up-

-a muck-covered BARBASOL CAN

Nick kneels washes the can off in the stream then pulls out
his cell phone and punches a number-

NICK
Yo Objective secured Proceed
with extraction I‘1ll fire up the
homer
He pulls a REMOTE CONTROL from his vest pushes in a red
button-
EXT BEACH - HOMING DEVICE

A BLINKING RED LIGHT flicks on the device BEEPING softly-

EXT JUNGLE - DAY

Nick moves quickly but cautiously through thick jungle
passing by a few of the big ROOT-HOLES He slows frowning

listening-
A RUSTLE behind him
A SNAP to the side

He starts up again very slowly Again the RUSTLE in the
brush around him Him brings the shotgun up crouching-

JEFE (0S)
Bajelo

Nick freezes turns his head-

iW
( Out of the trees all arounji him appear a squad of six
SECURITY RANGERS in camo uniforms armed with short-barrelled
AUTOMATIC RIFLES The JEFE waves his rifle at Nick-

JEFE
Deje caer las armas y pdéngase al
suelo

SEGUNDO

He wants you to drop your weapons
and lie on the ground

JEFE
No tenga miedo nomads queremos la
lata

SEGUNDO

Don’t be afraid We only want the
can Your escopeta por favor put
it on the ground

NICK

Nick takes a deep breath calculating looks around at the
men surrounding him He sees something-

‘e

SEGUNDO
Is very good we find you before the
dinosaurs do
RANGERS NICK
We shoot Zrom behind the Jefe and Segundo toward Nick-
NICK
I was told there aren’t any left on

the island

SEGUNDO
(smiles) Oh theres a few-

NICK
Like the one standing behind you
SEGUNDO

We shoot the Segundo in profile as he LAUGHS-

SEGUNDC
That wont work my friend The
ones left here only come out in the
night-

CHOMP A RAPTCR’s head lunges into the shot jaws clamping
on Segundo’s neck and shoulder He SCREAMS-

WIDER

Another RAPTOR pops up from the hole next to the Jefe The
Rangers start to FIRE their weapons as ANOTHER and ANOTHER
and ANOTHER jet-black ruby-eyed EXCAVARAPTORS (‘digging
killers’ or just DIGGERS) pop up from the holes- the men have
been standing in the middle of a colony of them

(These creatures are bow-legged with huge mole-like DIGGING
CLAWS at the ends of their powerful forelimbs)

Bap-bap-bap-bap-bap-bap-bap The Rangers have their rifles
on spray and pray as they panic and scatter the Jefe pinned
under one of the beasts’ powerful legs

Nick darts past the Segundo as the DIGGER lifts the man off
his feet and shakes him AUTOMATIC GUNFIRE rips into the
trees around Nick as he dodges through the thick undergrowth
a pair of the monsters pursuing him-

NICK

Nick zigzags between tree trunks hurdles roots and fallen
logs while the bigger DIGGERS crash straight through slowed
by the foliage We hear SCREAMS and GUNFIRE from behind
growing more distant Nick gets hung up on a prickler vine
for a moment the lead DIGGER gaining-

Nick twists and BLAM BLAM blasts the creature in the face
and neck as it rushes in for the kill

The digger staggers falls to one knee as Nick tears free and
sprints away We HOLD as the second raptor reaches its
wounded comrade pauses ROARS and then continues the chase-

CLEARING

Nick staggers bleeding from the pricker vine into an
overgrown CLEARING He leans his back against the grill of
an abandoned SERVICE VEHICLE faded ‘Jurassic Park’ logo on
its side He catches his breath listening quickly

reloading his shotgun-

A pointy little lizard-face pops up behind him looking out
through the shattered windshield of the vehicle
COMPSOGNATHUS

It is joined by ANOTHER and ANOTHER and SEVERAL MORE Cne
SQUEAKS Nick stiffens then whirls-

BLAM he FIRES just as a dozen of the little carnivores
stream out of the window at him the ones that aren’t blown
back into the vehicle by the blast leaping onto his face
shoulders chest arms SQUEAKING excitedly Nick spins
swatting and snatching compys flying off him then sprints
for the nearby BUILDING

We HOLD on his abandoned SHOTGUN lying on the ground-

INT BUILDING

We shoot through a half-broken WINDOW as Nick sprints toward
us a dozen COMPYS in pursuit He picks up speed dives
folding his arms over his head- CRASH Shards of glass go
flying as he dives through the window does a forward roll
twists and comes up on one knee pulling his PISTOL from his
holster in one motion- POP POP POP POP He picks off
the compys one by one as they jump onto the windowsill

The rest of them seem to take the hint Nick lowers his bead
on the window opening looks around-

We are in a dusty STAFF BARRACKS- a half-dozen BUNK BEDS
frames draped with COBWEBS along the walls footlockers an
old boombox a coffeemaker in one corner by a row of standing
lockers Simple but not spartan

A POSTER of a TYRRANOSAURUS is starting to curl on the wall
Someone has drawn a knife and a fork in its front claws and
written in a cartoon balloon above its head- “Pass the

tourists please”

Nick pulls the laminated map off his neck studies it—

NICK
(reading) Staff Quarters One Two
and Three- utility tunnel-

ECU MAP

We FOLLOW Nicks FINGER over the detailed diagram of the old
Park DOTTED LINES indicating a utility tunnel that leads
from the staff barracks to a power station near the south

fence-
‘e

-leads to the power station-

NICK

NICK
-which is only two hundred yards

from the beach

Nick looks around steps over to a HATCH in one corner of the
room He bends grabs the handle pistol ready in his other
hand then yanks the hatch cover open

Nothing jumps out at him

Nick looks down into the BLACKNESS He un-velcros a small
but powerful FLASHLIGHT from his belt shines it down the

hatch-

POV - HATCH

We see a rusted metal LADDER leading down a cement floor-

NICK
Nick considers the tunnel looks back to the window-
Three compys stand ready on the windowsill watching-

Nick whips his pistol around but they jump away before he can
fire-

He looks back into the dark tunnel below-

NICK
No way José

He looks around sees--

A CEILING HATCH over one of the bunk beds

Nick crosses makes a face as he swipes away thick sheets of
COBWEB climbs onto the top bunk reaches up The EYEHOOK

and LATCH have rusted stuck together they wont budge Nick
takes the butt of his pistol gives it a hard rap-

The hatch falls open and the top half of a half-eaten DEAD
MAN drops through

Nick SHOUTS in surprise leaping backwards off the bed and
sprawling onto the fleor whipping his pistol up ready to
shoot-

The BODY is a Security Ranger who has been gnawed on pretty
bad maybe a week old

Nick lowers his pistol breathes deeply trying to get his
heartbeat under control-

WHAM The DIGGER crashes through the front door and tumbles
across the room sliding on the floor and knocking the
coffeemaker and standing lockers down on top of itself

Nick is trapped in the corner The digger scrambles to its
feet ROARS lunges- Nick pulls the bunk bed down over
himself as a shield crouching-

THOONK the raptor’s leg goes right through the deteriorated
mattress and springs claws just missing Nick’s throat He
scrambles out as the beast writhes to free itself makes it
to the tunnel hatch and starts down the ladder grabbing the
handle on the underside of the cover-

LADDER NICKS FEET

CRACK The rusted metal rungs give way snapping Nick
falling but able to yank the hatch cover-

THUNK THUMP Nick hits the tunnel floor and the hatch
cover falls shut throwing us into BLACKNESS

CRANG Raptor CLAWS punch through the hatch cover then yank
away tearing away the thin metal Three stripes f DAYLIGHT
appear to illuminate Nick below getting to his feet CRANG
the raptor tears at the hatch cover again Nick flicks the
flashlight back on trots into the dark high-ceilinged
tunnel ahead-

EXT ISLAND COAST - SKY
We see through the palms to a small PONTOON PLANE approaching
over the sea-

INT COCKPIT - CONTROL PANEL HOMING SCREEN

A jerry-rigged HOMING SCREEN clipped to the control panel has
a BLINKING RED LIGHT lined up with the central cross hairs-
‘e

REVERSE - PILOT

The pilot a hippie-looking character in a Deadhead shirt
named DARWIN scans the beach-

DARWIN
Youre sposed to be here dude

BEACH

We watch as the plane slows and comes in for a water landing
TRACKING to meet it as it taxis up to the surfline

Darwin cuts the engine hops out and into the water
wrestling the little plane around so it is pointing out to
sea MUTTERING all the while-

DARWIN
This gig is gnarly enough without
being late man Security guards
spy gear probly some kind of
psychosauruses still running around
the island-

He runs a line from a U-bolt under the tail assembly to a
thick ROOT sticking up from a half-buried DRIFTWOOD STUMP
glancing at his watch-

DARWIN
I give you ten minutes and then I‘m
history

INT UTILITY TUNNEL

Nick is trotting along the utility tunnel pipes and wires
overhead So far so good He stops at a FORK in the
tunnel shines the light on his map-

NICK
There’s no fork on the damn map-

HRRRRRRRRRONK The ROAR of the digger ECHOES down the tunnel
behind him No time for eenie meenie minie moe Nick runs
yight- CRUNCH CRUNCH CRUNCH Something underfoot- Nick

swings the light down-

EGGSHELLS Big ones Dozens of them all over the floor-

NICK
Terrific It’s the nursery-
‘e

HRRRRRONK Another echoing ROAR sends Nick running again
We HOLD and watch him trot away Something in SILHOUETTE
drops from the pipes above and FOLLOWS

LOW-ANGLE - NICK

Trotting past us As his light FADES a pair of yellow
REPTILE EYES right in front cf us POP OPEN

NICK

We TRACK BEHIND Nick as he rushes along Up ahead we can see
a single SHAFT of SUNLIGHT angling down- the light at the end
of the tunnel Closer closer- Nick points the flashlight
beam ahead to see-

Three SPITTERS standing between him and the exit ladder

The one closest HISSES its frilled MANTLE popping up in
display Nick whirls around shines the light-

Here come four more spitters and behind them HRRRRRONK the
digger closing in

Nick turns- POP POP POP POP The spitters back up a
bit but don’t run as Nick opens FIRE on them He clenches
the pistol in his mouth jumps- and grabs onto the pipes
above swinging forward hand-to-hand bringing his knees up
to his chest as the spitters jump and snap beneath him teeth
just inches away

One of the spitters scrambles up the exit ladder ahead turns-

BLAM BLAM Nick FIRES hanging by one arm for a moment
The spitter falls and Nick drops the pistol swings forward
and hooks the top of the ladder with a foot-

EXT PARK GROUNDS - BACK FENCE

Nick crawls out of the tunnel opening runs A spitter pops
up right behind him looks around- then is YANKED back into
the hatchway by its tail

SNARLING CHOMPING NOISES then the DIGGER powers its way out
of the opening sniffs once and heads after Nick-
‘e

FENCE

Nick looks at the twelve-foot-high fence above him back at
the charging raptor He slips his backpack off tries to
squeeze through a very narrow OPENING that some short animal
has torn at the base of the fence He gets hung up squirms-
and slips through just as WHAM the digger smashes into the
fence headfirst trying to grab him

Nick springs to his feet sees that the backpack is just on
the far side of the fence the BARBASOL CAN visible ina
webbing pocket The digger starts to DIG furiously at the

base of the fence huge clods of dirt flying behind him
Nick runs parallel to the fence SLAPPING it with his hand-

NICK
Come on you stupid lizard come and
get me Come on knucklehead

The raptor leaves his digging and begins to run parallel on
the other side catching up with Nick-

NICK
Thats it Einstein follow the
nice man- thattabo-
Nick puts on the brakes as he sees ahead-

Twenty yards further down a whole section of fence has fallen-
The raptor sees it too
They look at each other-

NICK
See you on the beach

Nick sprints back toward the original hole and his backpack
The raptor takes a step after him thinks then turns to race
for the open section-

FENCE BACKPACK
Nick races back thrusts his arm through the hole and grabs

the backpack yanks it through and runs for the trees
pulling the Barbasol can free and discarding the backpack-

Darwin is looking at his watch-

DARWIN
Well youre just in time to be too

NICK (0S)
Hey

We PAN with Darwins look to see Nick break out of the
treeline onto the sand a couple hundred yards away sprinting

toward him-

NICK
Start it up

Darwin hurries out onto a pontoon and climbs into the cockpit-

DARWIN
No problem dude

He hits the ignition and the engine COUGHS into action the
PROP spinning picking up revs-

DARWIN
Lift anchor and we‘re airborne-

HRRRRRONK

He swivels to see the DIGGER bust out of the trees not more
than thirty yards away

NICK

Nick pulls up short the monster between him and the plane
He makes a beeline for the water calling out-

NICK
Taxi out I‘1ll swim to you

DIGGER
The raptor takes a look at Nick already splashing into the

surf then at the big noisy thing at the water’s edge It
chooses the easier prey charging toward the plane BELLOWING-

PLANE DARWIN
Darwin panics jams the throttle forward-

DARWIN
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhgh

The plane blasts forward but the tide has risen and there’s
a lot cf slack in the line from the tail-

DRIFTWOOD STUMP

CRACK The line snaps taut and YANKS the root it was tied to
clear off from the stump

PLANE

The plane picks up speed the big driftwood root skittering
in its wake-

CLOSER - DRIFTWOOD ROOT

The wood skips and splashes on the surface like a dropped
water-skiing handle Just as it hops past the camera there
is a sudden RISING in the water beside us- was that the crown
of an enormous wedge-shaped REPTILE HEAD or were we just

seeing things

We PAN to see as the plane lifts off-

DIGGER

Thigh deep in the surf it BELLOWS in frustration as the
plane buzzes away-

NICK

Nick is swimming out to sea for all he’s worth He looks
back to shore- unless that thing can do the Australian crawl
he’s made it He treads water waves to the sky-

NICK
Come back It‘s all clear

We PAN to the sky and yes the plane is banking turning
coming back and dropping toward the surface-

NICK
Easy buddy easy No sweat now-

PLANE

The plane steadies pontoons skimming the water’s surface-

DRIFTWOOD ROOT
The hunk of wood skittering along again till-

WHOOSH CHOMP A KRONOSAURUS gigantic sea-monster that it
is shoots its eight-foot-long head up and snatches the
trolling bait in its powerful jaws

CRACK The line snaps taut and RIPS the whole tail section
of the plane off

COCKPIT DARWIN

Darwin instinctively yanks back on the joystick trying to
pull up-

DARWIN
Whoooocoah

NICK

Nick watches shocked as the plane pulls up but can’t hold
its yaw with the tail gone It spirals heading back
straight at Nick arcing toward the water- closer closer-
Nick takes a breath and goes UNDER-

UNDERWATER - NICK

Nick tries to get deeper as the shape of the plane passes
close overhead and we hear a MUFFLED WATERY CRASH

SURFACE

Nick pops back up to the surface looks around- we PAN to see
the plane sitting sideways in the water fifty yards away
chunks of wing torn off and already floating It settles
upside-down the pontoons still on the surface keeping it
afloat

A beat

Darwin comes up sputtering hauls himself onto one of the
pontoons and sits gasping for breath He sees Nick swimming
toward him calls-

DARWIN
Hey man what happened
‘e

Nick
(swimming calls) I just saw your

DARWIN
(shakes his head) It never did
that before You got a phone

NICK
Yeah A wet one

DARWIN
(sees) Hey- those security dudes
don’t have like a- a submarine do
they

We PAN with his GAZE--

Something big and long is moving fast just under the water’‘s
surface straight at Darwin on the wrecked plane

DARWIN

Darwin is standing now backing his toes away from the water-

DARWIN
Cause unless thats Flipper I’m-

WHOOSH SNAP SPLASH The KRONOSAURUS breaks surface
snatches Darwin in its jaws half its enormous body clearing
water then SMACKING down into the water and diving a huge
SERRATED FLUKE slapping the surface as it disappears

NICK

Nick is stunned for a second then looks to the shore-

The DIGGER is stalking the beach watching him Cant go
back there-

Nick begins to swim parallel to the shore looking around for
signs of the sea monster He hears the CHOP of a HELICOPTER

looks up-

POV HELICOPTER

A gunship-style HELICOPTER is racing across the water toward
him flying low over the water a RESCUE LADDER already being

lowered-

NICK

Nick begins to swim toward it-

AERIAL SHOT

We look from above at Nick swimming then TILT to see the
KRONOSAURUS‘s back and forehead break water as it surfaces to
swim after him-

SURFACE

On the first pass the ladder swings just out of Nicks reach
going too fast He sees the Kronosaurus now raising its
head as it streaks toward him opening its jaws-

The helicopter banks and hovers- Nick grabs the ladder He
pulls himself up a few feet shouts to the rescuers above him-

NICK
Take it up Take it up

KRONOSAURUS

We ride the back of the Kronosaurus as it powers toward Nick
who is still dangling temptingly only a few feet above the
waters surface We look over its massive barnacled horned
head as it lunges up- SNAP just missing the bottom of the
ladder as the helicopter suddenly shoots up into the air

INT HELICOPTER

We shoot out the side bay seeing the Kronosaurus and Isla
Nublar receding in the distance Strong arms appear to drag
Nick in He lies back on the floor chest heaving-

The man who leans over in his face is wearing the same
Grendel Corporation Security Ranger UNIFORM as the men on the

island-

Nick raises his head slightly taps his ear as if he can’t
hear-

Then slowly the sound of the HELICOPTER FADES back UP as
well as the LIGHT-

Nick is lying on the floor still BLOOD on his face He
opens his eyes slowly blinks-

He sees the BARBASOL CAN lying on Nando’s lap just an arms
reach away Nando is busy joking in Spanish with the pilot-

Nick swivels his eyes-

He can see below out the side bay They are cruising fairly
low over the water parallel to a thickly populated BEACH
Lots of SWIMMERS in the water-

Nick checks to see that his hands and legs are free gathers
his strength-

EXT BEACH

A GASP from the spectators on the beach as the man falls out
of the helicopter and into the water forty feet below then
APPLAUSE as he pops up to the surface and swims rapidly
toward shore They think it’s a stunt The helicopter banks
over the water and heads back to cut him off-

Overton walks toward the shore unsteady on the sand-

Nick stands struggling to get out of the water hits the
beach running through the delighted beach crowd till WHOOOOM
the chopper swoops down at him from behind struts narrowly
missing his head as he dives for the ground rotors BLASTING
SAND at the now terrified people

Nick is up running again aerosol can in hand shouting to
Overton as he sprints past him-

NICK
Ask for a cold one at Rodrigo’s

Overton turns and watches Nick duck into the cover of the
lunch palapas and fried-everything stands at the back edge of
the beach the buildings of the resort town rising behind
them The HELICOPTER hovers above turning this way and that
like an indecisive hummingbird-

EXT ALLEYWAY

HELICOPTER SOUND from above as Nick hustles down a BACK

He darts across the alley and in through the BACK DOOR of a

INT KITCHEN - RODRIGOS

An OLD MAN sits at a small table shucking OYSTERS He barely
locks up as Nick enters crosses to check out the action in
the bar then turns to look around the kitchen-

An ancient Coca Cola COOLER buzzes in one corner Nick moves
to it lifts the lid and sets the BARBASOL CAN in the midst
of dozens of BOTTLES OF BEER He turns to the Old Man-

NICK
Voy a enviar alguien para

The Old Man shrugs and keeps on shucking Nick looks up as
the HELICOPTER SOUND grows LOUDER-

Nick considers reaches to take his key from its cubbyhole-

Nick limps towards us down the corridor He turns the key
opens the door-- Nando stands there with a different aerosol

INT TOWER BEDROOM - NICK - EVENING

Nick wakes in a cozy-looking bed in a round stone-walled
room He looks around confused- yodelling

He sits up barefoot wearing clean pants and a T-shirt He
stands steadies himself a little woozy- then crosses
immediately to the thick oaken DOOR tries it-- locked

He crosses to the opposite side of the room and sticks his
head out a tall rectangular OPENING-

EXT TOWER - EVENING

We see Nicks head pop out through the window of a STONE
TOWER at one corner of a MEDIEVAL CASTLE on a mountainside in
the SWISS ALPS He looks right- on the opposite PARAPET are
two YODELERS in archaic lederhosen and plumed hats giving
their tonsils a workout for a crowd of TOURISTS standing down
on the other side of the MOAT The Yodelers finish the
Tourists APPLAUD enthusiastically and Nick ducks his head
back in-

NICK
I’m a prisoner in a theme park

He looks around-- his suitcase is open on a stand his jacket
hanging in an armoire Heraldic BANNERS hang on the walls
There is a TV SET and remote control He picks up the
remote flicks the set ON begins to surf-

French-speaking channels German-speaking channels Spanish
Italian- were definitely in Europe here He settles on a
channel playing a NATURE DOCUMENTARY about the dinosaur
pests the NARRATOR with a plummy British accent-

extremely aggressive

NICK
No kidding

He flicks the TV OFF A booming KNOCK at the door-

NICK
(calling) It’s locked

A KEY fumbling then the door opens to reveal a BUTLER
dressed in livery He has a slight Swiss accent-

BUTLER
They are ready for you downstairs
Mr Harris

The Butler steps away without closing the door Nick
considers-

INT GREAT HALL

Nick fully-dressed now comes down a STONE STAIRCASE that
Basil Rathbone should be swordfighting on to see-

ADRIEN JOYCE a man only slightly older than Nick and very
fit swinging a HALBERD around in an elaborate martial-arts
display thrusting parrying chopping slicing-—- thoroughly
enjoying himself till he sees that Nick has entered He
freezes in a backswing smiles-

JOYCE
Its not only for ceremony you
know The halberd The Swiss
Guards who protect the Pope at the
Vatican could do a good deal of
damage with these- of course
they’ve also got an automatic
pistol somewhere under those crazy
uniforms-

NICK
Maybe you should apply for a job

Joyce crosses to hang the halberd over the enormous FIREPLACE-

JOYCE
I haven‘t seen you since what-

NICK
Tegucigalpa I helped get you
kicked out of the country

JOYCE
To be deported from Hondurss— what
horror must I have perpetrated

NICK
Selling guns to the wrong people
as I recall

JOYCE
But they were the right people when
I began the transaction The
political sands are ever-shifting-—

He indicates the very huge GREAT HALL around them-

JOYCE
Something the Swiss understand
better than anyone This castle
was built in the late fifteenth
century by a local warlord and seif-
styled baron seeking to isolate
himself from the endless armed
conflicts of Europe and if
possible to profit from them

Joyce indicates a huge TAPESTRY hanging on the wall
portraying a bloody battle with horses lances swords
shields and plenty of dead foot soldiers littering the

battlefield-

JOYCE
He hired men and trained them to
fight selling- I should say
renting- their services to whomever
put cash on the barrelhead
Security forces invasions sieges-
the Swiss mercenary was a force to
be reckoned with My employer the
current Baron von Drax is
principal stockholder and CEO of
the Grendel International
Corporation

NICK
You make a hell of a tour guide
Joyce What do you want with me
JOYCE

You have something that belongs to
us

NICK
I lost it in the ocean

JOYCE
Well match Hammond‘s offer

NICK
I made my deal with him

JOYCE
(concerned) But you haven’t
delivered it have you

Nick makes a quick assessment of his situation-

NICK
It’s- it’s somewhere safe

JOYCE
(smiles) I’m happy to hear that

Nick
ow’

Joyce crosses to Nick-

JOYCE
I do apologize for the abrupt
nature of your transportation here
but the sensitive nature of the
material in question-

NICK
Like that it’s illegal-

An edge of menace enters Joyces tone-

JOYCE
There was some consideration given
to torturing the whereabouts out of
you I suggested that given your
history this would be

counterproductive (smiles)
Besides we want you to work for
us

INT PASSAGEWAY

ELECTRIC LAMPS on old torch sconces light the way as Joyce
leads Nick down a narrow passageway on another stone

JOYCE
Grendel plans to use the material
from Jurassic Park in much the same
way as that envisioned by your Mr
Hammond-

NICK
The United Nations-—

JOYCE

When the infestation of creatures
begins to seriously inconvenience
the First World the United Nations
will snap to attention Previously
rejected solutions drastic as they
may seem will be reconsidered-
solutions we’d be able to offer

NICK
For a price

JOYCE
Naturally And then there’s a
related project the one we hope
youll become involved in-

Nick slows as he hears a massive POUNDING ahead like a pile-
driver rhythmically destroying a paved parking lot-

NICK
Remodelling
JOYCE
(smiles) Thats what we tell the

He unlatches a DUNGEON DOOR in front of them and they step
into-
INT DUNGEON
They stand on the entry PLATFORM above a well-lit stone

Below them nearly filling the room is a heavily-plated

ve ANKYLOSAURUS repeatedly thrashing the bowling-ball-sized
bone protuberance at the end of its massive tail as a cudgel
knocking dents into the wall and sending rock-dust flying

NICK JOYCE

Joyce tries to fit his words in between the rhythmic WHAM
the ankylosaurus’s assault-

of

JOYCE
A souvenir from our clean-up effort
on Isla Nubla We raised it from

an egg-

SHERMAN
From an embryo to be precise

SHERMAN has appeared behind them He is a young genetics
whiz and sorely lacking in ‘people skills’-

JOYCE
Nick this is our chief of Applied
Genetics Sherman Fosdick-

SHERMAN
(plowing through) Like the embryos
you stole from us (points to
ankylosaurus) Maybe we should put
him down with her for awhile-

e

JOYCE
Be polite Sherman We havent
even had dinner yet

Joyce leads Nick away whispering as they go-

JOYCE
Too much Dungeons and Dragons not
enough socializing with the other
children-

NICK
Why bother having that thing if
youre going to keep it shut up in
a dungeon

JOYCE
Oh- one never knows when an
ankylosaurus might come in handy
They have reached another metal-reinforced door This one
however opens with a swipe of Joyce’s ID card-

INT LABORATORY CHAMBER

Nick and Joyce step into something out of a James Bond movie
a CAVERN hollowed out in the core of the mountain beneath the
castle metal stairs leading down into a maze of brightly-lit
biological-testing LABS-

JOYCE
The castle sits on an enormous
cavern in the mountain The
original Baron kept his wine down
here We’ve expanded a bit-

They start down the stairs-

NICK
The corporation paid for all this

JOYCE
We have several products that are
doing very well at the moment- an
insect-resistant rye grain super-
strains of hops and barley- and of
course we were the first in Europe
to market pre-sliced cheese Dairy
is very important here in

against the I-beams that enclose it ROARS and generally
throws a fit in a bull-ring-sized ENCLOSURE Spray-painted
in day-glo orange on its side is ‘X-1 and attached to one
side of its head just above the ear-hole is a REGULATOR BOX

about the size of a cell phone-

INT OBSERVATION ROOM

A woman in a lab coat with the ubiquitous Grendel
International logo on the pocket stands watching the beast
and writing on a CHART This is MAYA LUNDBERG Several TV
SCREENS are mounted on the wall above her providing various
angles of the peast’s activity while the panel in front of
her sports a half-dozen VITAL FUNCTION MONITGRS of the EEG
MRI and heart-rate sort She doesnt look up from her work-

JOYCE
This is X-1 our alpha male- not in
the best of moods at the mcement

MAYA
If you keep them in captivity
youve got to accept a certain
amount of neurotic behavior

JOYCE

Training not captivity please-
MAYA

Whatever-
JOYCE

Maya Lundberg our head of
Behavioral Modification Meet Mr

Harris-

This gets Maya’s attention She turns to check Nick out-

MAYA
The trespasser

JOYCE
(to Nick) We all followed your
progress on the island Sort of
like an episode of Survivor-

Nick steps up to the window and looks in at the raging beast-

NICK
So this is what like a mid-sized
Tyrranosaurus

MAYA
Deinonychus ‘Terrible claw’ in
Latin

SHERMAN
(rejoining them) Deinonychus
draxi It‘s a sub-species

Sherman checks a timer looks at the panel instruments-

SHERMAN
Wow- look at that adrenaline-

MAYA
(concerned and annoyed) Would you
shut him down Hes going to hurt
himself

SHERMAN
X-1 is too cagey to hurt himself
no matter how much we pump him up-

Sherman steps up to a RADIO TRANSMITTER punches the timer
turns a dial-

SHERMAN
Call out when the reticular
formation goes blue-

Maya is watching a BRAIN SCAN image which is rapidly changing
from RED to cooler colors-

The DEINONYCHUS begins to stagger a bit appears confused-
SHERMAN

(excited) Look at that And Im
only restricting acetylcholine-

MAYA
Dont make him fall over again
His ribs-
SHERMAN
(dialing) Come on baby nice soft
landing-

The deinonychus lowers itself into a CROUCH partly
supporting itself with its shorter front legs breathing
heavily and staring somewhat glassily into space Nick is
amazed-

JOYCE
Weve placed a few strategic
implants to let us control its
hormones by radio signal-
‘oe

SHERMAN
Not hormones neuropeptides-

MAYA
Right now it’s experiencing
something like acute chronic
fatigue syndrome Before you came
in the parts of its gray matter
controlling rage and aggressive
behavior were stimulated

JOYCE
You remember the cockfights in
Honduras When a rooster gets mad
blood flows into its comb
responding to the adrenaline But
if the handler put the comb in his
mouth and sucked blood into it- the
rooster got mad before he even saw
his opponent

SHERMAN
Fortunately for us reptiles have a
very compartmentalized brain just
like chickens We don’t get much
spillover when we want to induce a
specific emotion

NICK
For what purpose

Maya and Sherman look to Joyce-- it’s not their place to
out this information-

JOYCE
Lets leave that for tomorrow You
must be exhausted- youll travelled
all the way from the Jurassic Era
to the 21st century

Maya steps forward and takes his hand-
MAYA
Mr Harris- I look forward to

working with you

Joyce takes a last look in at the pacified X-1-

Nick surreptitiously glances down at his hand Maya has
palmed a torn corner of her behavior chart into it on which

she has written-

Do not give them the embryos

JOYCE (0S)
You kind of wonder what hes
thinking don’t you

NICK

Nick and Maya exchange a quick look then Nick turns to look
at the dinosaur X-1 seems to focus for a moment meeting

his eye-

He’s wondering which one of us he
should eat first

Let’s bring them out then

Nick realizes what’s going on-

NICK
Whooah now youre not going to
let-

JOYCE
I assure you they’re totally under
control

A DEINONYCHUS and then ANOTHER trot out through the chute
and stand in the open standing several yards away from the
humans watching them warily
©

Both have regulators on the side of their heads We can tell
by the spray-paint on their sides that tnis is X-2 and X-3
(Orestes and Ferseus)-

JOYCE

See

NICK
These are more of those deino-

JOYCE
-nychus draxi They already
possessed the super-sensitive smell
and hearing the power the pack-
hunting instincts we desired then
Sherman got busy splicing genes

SHERMAN
(impressed with himself) A section
of DNA from the egg-stealing
raptor Ornitholestes to lengthen
the forelegs and give them more
dexterity with the fingers a
section from the domestic dog that
seems to foster obedience and
receptivity to training anda
small section of human DNA that we
hope will increase their problem-
solving ability

NICK
If you don’t get a leash on those
things were going to have a major
problem to solve-

JOYCE
(smiles) Maya Let’s give Mr
Harris a demonstration

Maya stands in the Humvee calls out in a commanding voice-

MAYA
Raptors

The beasts respond turning to watch her intently She
signals with her arm pointing down the dirt road that leads
ahead into a stand of TREES-

MAYA
Forward

X-2 and X-3 begin to trot down the road Kroner pulls out to
follow them and the whole menagerie of vehicles joins in
Mayas control Humvee just behind the Land Rover-
‘eo

Joyce hands Nick a thick red ARMBAND about the size of a
blood-pressure cuff like the ones he and all the other staff

are wearing-

JOYCE
Put this on It releases
pheromones the raptors have been
trained to avoid

Nick slips the armband on-

NICK
It doesn’t smell like anything-

JOYCE
To them it does

Nick watches the beasts trotting up ahead-

NICK
They look different

The raptors have in fact changed color since they first
came out of the chute from GRAYISH to a mottled GREEN-BROWN
that matches the countryside around them-

JOYCE
Theyre regular chameleons- put
them in front of a brick wall and
you’d swear you can see the mortar

NICK
(nods) So were taking them for a
stroll-

JOYCE

Were in convoy moving through
enemy territory

Nick gives him a look-

NICK
I think you‘ve let this Colonel
thing get to your head
Joyce just smiles as they enter the TREES the road narrowing
somewhat-

The deinonychus slow down up ahead then stop alert-
CLOSER - RAPTORS

Quick shots of the raptors’ NOSTRILS sniffing EYES darting-

NICK JOYCE
Nick looks around them into the trees-

NICK
What’s out there

JOYCE
Theyll know before we do

X-1 and 2

The raptors suddenly dart away into the trees to the left
SHRIEKING with aggression AUTOMATIC GUNFIRE opens up from
the position they‘re running at an AMBUSH EMPLACEMENT dug

beneath a huge fallen log-

NICK
Nick ducks instinctively but Joyce remains standing-

JOYCE
Dont worry it’s blank ammunition
Have to get them used to the noise-

RAPTORS - AMBUSH BUNKER

The raptors hit the bunker on the dead run the lead cne
leaping and landing on the log above the firing position
both legs the second charging straight in and thrusting
the opening with its ‘terrible claw’

with
into

The two rapidly demolish the position soft dirt and chunks
of bark wood and moss flying in every direction till they
have unearthed a rectangular iron PROTECTIVE CAGE containing

two terrified MERCENARIES who have dropped their weapons

and

SCREAM for help as the massive creatures roll the whole thing

over and over jabbing in with their sickle-claws and
STOMPING the bars out of shape

54

STAFF

The other Mercenaries have dismounted and move forward
nervously with their various weapons and gear-

JOYCE
Shut them down Sherman-

Sherman is worried watching his instrument panel-

SHERMAN
They’re on full restraint already

Nick leaps out of the Land Rover grabs the nastiest weapon
he sees (something like a RPG launcher) from a mercenary

aims-

JOYCE
Grab him

Mercenaries dive on Nick wrestling the grenade launcher from
him and pinning him on the ground-

The raptors are subdued as well breathing heavily but
sitting back on their haunches on either side of the battered
protective cage The men inside are equally battered but
alive-

Maya walks out to within a few yards of them hands held
before her-

MAYA
Easy easy-

Nick watches from the ground amazed at her courage (or
stupidity)-

Maya turns and calls to Sherman in the control vehicle-

MAYA
Give them a blast of serotonin as a
reward

Sherman twists a dial-
The raptors’ eyes half-close with bliss-

MAYA
All right just a little get-up-and-

go-

Sherman tweaks a different dial Maya points back toward the
chute-

MAYA
Raptors Home

Amazingly the two monsters right themselves and totally
ignoring the cage begin to move back toward the road and the

chute-

JOYCE
Let him up

The Mercenaries warily let Nick go He sits up watches the
deinonychus pass-

NICK
You almost got those men killed

JOYCE
On the contrary- we were just saved
from a deadly ambush by our advance

scouts
The Mercenaries remount their vehicles and begin to follow
Re the deinonychus back while a pair of MEDICS hurry to the

cage-

JOYCE
Why should some poor grunt have to
walk point through enemy territory
if youve got these creatures to do
it When Cortés conquered Mexico
he unleashed ferocious dogs on the
terrified Aztecs-

NICK
-who were fighting with arrows and
spears With real bullets-—

JOYCE
In a combat situation they’1ll be
fully armored Just think of the
psychological effect- talk about
your shock and awe-

NICK
(fully realizing) You want to use
them as soldiers
© JOYCE
SWAT team

(proud) Shock troops
riot control search and destroy--
the ultimate in special forces

Maya hops into the Humvee not happy-

MAYA
(to Sherman) What took it so long

SHERMAN
Im not sure-- they were
overexcited-

MAYA
The fact is you dont know

They pull away Nick walks over toward the cage The Medics
have had no luck getting the twisted entry lid to open-

MEDIC
to Joyce) We’‘re going to have to
torch this to get it open

JOYCE
Well send somebody out

He watches Nick who is still a bit shaken-

JOYCE
Youve been the first man in on
some of these operations Nick you
know the casualty rate-

NICK
You can‘t control them

JOYCE
(shrugs) Maya has taken them a
long way but she’s not a
professional soldier

Nick turns to look at him This is the pitch-

JOYCE
I know your history Nick- you’ve
always done what you were told
extremely well and never asked too
many questions Youve been used
and abused and don’t have much to
show for it Isn‘’t it time you got
paid what you’re worth

EXT TRAINING ENCLOSURE

A smaller deinonychus X-5 (Achilles) wearing a kind of
HARNESS around its body paces in an outdoor ENCLOSURE about
the size of the lion tamer’s cage at the circus A HUNK OF
BEEF is hung just outside the bars X-5 approaches it warily-

22ZZZZZZZZTTTTTT it receives an enormous ELECTRICAL JOLT
administered by ZEISS a rather sadistic mercenary at a
console just beyond the bars-—

ZEISS
We have learned our lesson maybe

The Humvee pulls up and Maya charges out of it-

MAYA
Zeiss What are you doing

ZEISS
It continues to eat whenever it
pleases It needs to learn-

MAYA
The only thing it could learn from
this is that youre a nitwit and
it probably already knows that
And the harness-—

ZEISS
The neuro-implant induces nausea
not pain

MAYA

This is behavior modification
Zeiss not torture

Joyce and Nick have returned as well Kroner standing at
something like attention behind them Maya crosses to a
narrow DOOR-

MAYA
Unlock

ZEISS
He’s very upset-—

MAYA
At you Unlock

Zeiss hits a switch and we hear a BOLT shoot open X-5 hears
it too snapping to attention-
e

‘e

Nick watches as Maya slides open a narrow DOOR squeezes in
CHANG Zeiss hits the switch and the dcocr closes behind her-

X-5 stands across the cage from her wary-

Maya doesnt move from next to the door for a moment
watching the beast-

MAYA
Stay

She slowly crosses to the beast never losing eye-contect—

MAYA
Easy- easy-

She is right next to xX-5 now holding its eyes as she deftly
unclips the harness and pulls it off-

MAYA
Good boy

She turns her back on the monster slowly walks to the door
The door shoots open she squeezes out- CHANG The door
shuts behind her She turns to Joyce still angry-

MAYA
Every time I start to make some
progress with this animal one of
your thugs sets it back two weeks

JOYCE
We have a timetable to be aware of

MAYA
Well youd better push it back

She strides away Joyce indicates X-5 to Nick-
JOYCE

A relatively new recruit You know
the type lots of attitude a bit

wild-

NICK
How many of these things do you
have

SHERMAN

Unfortunately the genetic

engineering involved in their

creation renders them sterile
(MORE)
‘e

SHERMAN (contd)
If were going to expand and have a
breeding program-

JOYCE
We need the embryos that you stole
from us

NICK
I’m not so sure that’s a good idea
What if you take them out for a
spin and one decides to go AWOL

SHERMAN
Even if the neuro-implant
malfunctioned they wouldn’‘t get
far Their bodies are capable of
creating insulin but lack the
stimulant that causes it to be
secreted- only we can perform this
function

JOYCE
Without us they can last only an
hour maybe less

NICK
(nods toward Maya) The patrol we
went on this morning- she didn’t
train them to do that did she

Sherman looks away-

JOYCE
There was a South African gentleman
named de Vroot- wonderful
storyteller- seemed to be getting
on very well with his trainees-

NICK
And what happened to him

JOYCE
(hesitant) Thats not totally
clear-

SHERMAN
We found one of his shoes

Joyce slaps Nick on the back winks-

JOYCE
Big risks big pay my friend
Dare to be great

INT CASTLE - DINING HALL

A long wooden table tapestries on the walls- there should be
tankards of ale and serving wenches but instead it’s Nick
Maya Sherman and Joyce sitting down for dinner with BARON
HERMAN VON DRAX a very self-satisfied character who has
spent a lifetime getting whatever he wants-

VON DRAX
Courage intelligence the so-
called ‘killer instinct’- these

are qualities I have always looked
for in my employees but it is the
rare to find them all in the same
individual So I think- ‘Why not
give Nature a helping hand’

SHERMAN
(fawning) The human DNA we used in
the deinonychus came from Baron von
Drax

Nick looks von Drax over-

NICK
Now that you mention it I can see
the resemblance

Maya hides a smile but the Baron is not distracted-

VON DRAX
We created our warriors from only
the finest ingredients

NICK
You can combine behavioral
attributes like you’re making a
cake

SHERMAN
At the moment we can narrow them
down to a certain section of the
chain It is possible that other
less desirable traits might hitch-
hike so to speak and end up as
part of the organism

VON DRAX
But this mix gives you something
greater than its parts- they are
full of hybrid vigor Like the
Swiss

NICK
But the Swiss aren’t sterile

Von Drax shoots Nick a hard appraising look then

LAUGHING-

VON DRAX
I am the twenty-third Baron von
Drax Mr Harris I assure you
that we are not

Nick sits back-

NICK
In the second world war there was a
program to train sea lions to place
magnetic mines on enemy ships
Tireless swimmers able to stay
under without oxygen tanks-—

SHERMAN
Did they blow anything up

NICK
Mostly fishing boats They
couldnt pass up a meal

MAYA
We‘re training our animals not to
eat what they kill That’s been
the most difficult instinct to
modify so far

VON DRAX
So-

He looks to Joyce-

VON DRAX
-the embryos are on their way ja

JOYCE
Mr Harris is still considering our
offer

Von Drax looks stricken-

VON DRAX
(slightly threatening) Consider it
as quickly as you can Mr Harris
Patience is not part of my genetic
heritage

INT TOWER ROOM - NIGHT

Nick sits on the edge of his bed watching a phony-looking
WAR MCVIE He clicks it OFF crosses to the door tries it-

not locked

INT STAIRWAY

Nick comes down the spiral STAIRCASE of the tower noting
several SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS as he goes-

EXT CASTLE - NIGHT

Nick steps out onto the TORCH-lit PARAPET of the castle He
sees Maya sitting brooding on the base of an ancient
CATAPULT He approaches taps the catapult-

NICK
I could send you over the moat with
this if you’d like

Maya looks up smiles-

MAYA
I may take you up on that

NICK
That‘s not the Grendel
International spirit I’m hearing

Maya shoots a look down into the courtyard- Kroner stands
leaning against a wall pretending he’s just out for a smoke
monitoring the conversation Nick sees him understands
Maya rises and they begin to stroll around the parapet-

MAYA
Had a few setbacks today

NICK
So how does one get to be a
dinosaur trainer
MAYA
(shrugs) Oh- I got my doctorate in
behavioral sciences did some field
work with wolves in the north of
Canada till the grant money started
drying up and then- well there
aren’t that many practical
applications So I took a job with
the circus

NICK
The circus

MAYA
In the ring with the whip and
chair pushing the big cats through
their routines Then there was a
certain trapeze artist I wanted to
get away from so when I was
approached for this job-

NICK
You knew what you were getting
into

MAYA

For my fifteenth birthday my father
promised to take me to opening day
at Jurassic Park Ive still got
the ticket When I heard I‘d be
working with animals that used to
be extinct-- well I didn’t ask too
many questions about what they were
going to be trained to do

NICK
In the cage this morning- how did
you know that thing wouldnt go for
you

Maya stops and they look out over the TOWN down the mountain
only a few LIGHTS still on-

MAYA
When a wolf pack works a herd of
elk they’1ll single out the weakest-
an orphaned juvenile an older
adult on its last legs- and look it
straight in the eye

INT SECURITY ROOM - MCNITOR - JOYCE AND VON DRAX

Joyce and von Drax stand watching and listening to Nick and
Maya who are being tracked by a SURVEILLANCE CAMERA-

MAYA (VIDEO)
There’s a conversation of death
that goes on between them hunter
and prey almost an understanding
I’ve seen the rest of the herd
continue to graze peacefully while
one of their number is set upon and
killed

Joyce turns to reassure the Baron-

JOYCE
I wouldn‘t worry to much about
Nick He‘ll come around

EXT PARAPET
ry Nick watches Maya‘’s face animated in the TORCHLIGHT-

MAYA
Twenty yards away there’s this
grisly murder and they keep chewing
grass Because they know it’s not
their turn

NICK
So you just looked it in the eye
and you could tell-

JOYCE
(arriving) Shes a bit of a
hypnotist our Maya

Joyce steps out from the base of the SECURITY TOWER-
JOYCE

But she doesn’t really approve of
our goals here

MAYA
Wild animals should not-

JOYCE
First of all theyre not wild
theyre bio-engineered We created

them
(MORE)

JOYCE (contd)
And like any other weaponized
organism their effectiveness
depends on the skill cf those who
deploy them

He turns to Nick-

JOYCE
Like any good soldier eh Nick

NICK
Good soldiers care what side
they’re on

JOYCE
Oh were on the side of the angels
here-

He pulls out a PHOTOGRAPH and hands it to Nick-

POV - PHOTOGRAPH

In the photo a LITTLE GIRL of about ten sits on a pony
smiling at the camera-

NICK
Whos this

Joyce looks smug having played his trump card-
JOYCE
She‘s the little girl whose life
youre going to save
INT STRATEGY ROOM WALL SCREEN

On the large WALL-SCREEN is a blow-up of an AERIAL PHOTO of a
section of a PORT CITY-

JOYCE (0S)
This section of the docks in
Tangier has mostly been abandoned

A ground-level PHOTO of dilapidated SHACKS AND WAREHOUSES
appears on the screen-

JOYCE (0S)
Our sources inform us that Isabel
Chartiers is being held somewhere
in the guarter

WIDER

Nick sits with Joyce as he clicks the next image cnto the
screen-

JOYCE
Her father is Betrand Chartiers
chairman of the Duhamel Group
which maintains substantial
financial holdings in many of
Frances former colonies

A well-dressed businessman CHARTIERS appears on the screen-

JOYCE
Two of his employees have already
been kidnapped The first a minor
functionary was killed during
protracted negotiations With the
second a junior vice president
the company paid the ransom
immediately-- with the same result

A photo of French police carrying a loaded BODY BAG out of a
tenement building appears-—

NICK
And the kidnappers

JOYCE
They seem to be motivated by a
personal grudge against Monsieur
Chartiers as much as by the lure of
ransom money They call themselves
the North African Liberation Front
but the little we know of them
suggests that their motives are
more criminal than political

NICK
And you’re sure she’s still alive

Joyce hits the clicker again A shaky VIDEO appears on the
screen- several black-hooded KIDNAPPERS move about in the
foreground and background of a smallish room as little ISABEL
faces the lens sitting at a central table-

ISABEL (VIDEO)
Papa Maman- jetais en bon santé
mais vous me manquez beaucoup Ces
gens ici mepouvaisent et il faut
que payez a eaux tout ce-quils

demandent

JOYCE
She says she’s scared and wants to
go home

They cross to a MODEL of the waterfront quarter laid out on a
table-

JOYCE
That arrived yesterday Theyve
given Chartiers a week to deliver
two million euros

NICK
A week is-

JOYCE
-is all weve got We can only
hope theyll keep her alive at
least till the ransom exchange

NICK
I could take a half-dozen good men
and-

JOYCE

And what Knock on doors The
quarter is a half-mile square Our
deinonychus given a few personal
articles will sniff the girl out
within minutes

NICK
So let one of them find her and
we1l-

JOYCE

Come in with guns blazing You
notice in the videos they always
have her in the center- to shoot at
them you put her in the middle of
a fire-fight But if the only
shooting should there be any
comes from them-

NICK
And what if your dincsaurs bust in
and one of the kidnappers keeps his
head long enough to turn a gun on
her

JOYCE
(shrugs) Then she will be spared
the very graphic sight of what
happens next

EXT VALLEY - DAY

Nick stands before the five Xes who are lined up outside the
chute staring at him-

Sherman portable radio control in hand and Maya stand
behind him-

Behind them are Joyce Zeiss and a DOZEN of von Draxs
‘Mercenaries’ armed and wary Everybody is wearing one of
the pheromone armbands-

Nick is in drill sergeant mode now standing at parade rest
and calling out-

NICK
Any soldier worth his pay has a
name to answer to not a number
Even the most sniveling little lap
dog answers to its name- Zeiss

ZEISS
(instinctively) Sir

NICK
See what I mean

Nick walks slowly along the line of Xes from highest to
lowest-

NICK
Achilles-- Hector-- Perseus--
Orestes---

He pauses in front of X-1 the biggest and most uneasy-
looking of the group considers-

NICK
Spartacus

He turns to address the humans-

NICK
You will learn these names and from
this moment forward will not fail
to refer to and address the
warriors by them Only three
members of the team will be chosen
for the mission at hand but all
will be trained for it

He looks specifically at Maya-

NICK
From now on- and this is very
important- all military directives
will be given by me and by me only
Is that understood

INT LABORATORY CHAMBER - RAPTOR ENCLOSURE

Very low light level Spartacus slowly moves across the room
toward a table with a soccer ball a boombox radio and a
roast pig on a platter lined up on it-

OBSERVATION ROOM

Nick Maya Sherman and behind them Joyce watch a NIGHT-
VISION version of Spartacus’ movement on a MONITOR-

NICK
Okay give him the works

Sherman flips a switch and-

ENCLOSURE

BLAM Pop Pop Pop At-at-at-at-at-at-at SOUNDS of
GUNFIRE and FLASHES on all sides of Spartacus He ROARS
then hurries to the table and sniffs each item settling on
the boombox which he deftly lifts up in one clawed hand and
moves back to the other side of the enclosure-

OBSERVATION ROOM
Nick clicks a STOPWATCH-

NICK
Stimulus off

Sherman hits a switch and the fireworks stop the LIGHTS turn
on in the enclosure Spartacus turns to glare at Nick Nick
nods back to him clicks on a speaker-

NICK
(into speaker) Excellent work
Spartacus (to Sherman) Shoot him
some love Sherman

Sherman turns a dial-

MAYA
Youre overdoing it with the
serotonin

NICK
(nods) Tomorrow well reward and
punish with insulin Remind them
that we control their vital
functions

MAYA
Were making them into a bunch of
drug addicts

NICK
Some day a pat on the back and a
‘Good boy’ might be enough to
motivate them

He stares back at the defiant Spartacus-

NICK
I don‘t think were there yet

EXT VALLEY

MILITARY MUSIC as we FOLLOW the raptors over and through a
kind of OBSTACLE COURSE They balance as they cross a single-
log bridge climb a mock-up of a two-story tenement wall with
fire escape jump down pick up speed to hurdle a trench full
of FIRE and finally slow to a cautious walk sniffing at the

ground as they go-

We PAN to Nick Joyce and Maya watching all them wearing
helmets with safety visors standing behind a protective WALL-

JOYCE
Von Drax is not going to be happy
if one of his investments gets
blown apart here
NICK
If they can‘t sniff out a mine six
inches under the dirt their
aggressiveness becomes a liability--
lock at this-

We SHIFT to see the raptors The others are holding back
watching as Achilles sniffs his way through the minefield
occasionally pressing his tail against the ground-

MAYA
There‘s a scent gland under his
tail-

NICK
Hes marking a trail for the
others

JOYCE

Did you teach them that

NICK
I wish I had Saves time only
risks one member of the team-

MAYA
Insightful behavior

They watch as Achilles gets to the other side of the
minefield calls back to the others with a CLICKING noise
The other four wind their way single file along the exact
route Achilles took-

NICK”
Makes you wonder what else theyve
been cooking up

Spartacus at the rear shoots a look to Nick-

EXT TRAINING ENCLOSURE - ANOTHER DAY

Maya stands at the center of the cage where she took the
harness off Achilles She is surrounded by the raptors
standing at ‘attention’ She has an armful of LITTLE GIRL’S
CLOTHING-

Sherman and Nick stand outside the enclosure with Zeiss and a
few other Mercenaries-

SHERMAN
When each one sniffs her clothing
I‘ll give hima jolt-

MAYA
We want them to protect her not be
afraid of her

SHERMAN
What then

MAYA
Oxytocin to the forebrain

SHERMAN
They‘re not going into labor-

MAYA
In males it reduces infanticide
promotes parenting behavior and
long-term pair bonding

NICK
The Daddy drug Didn‘t know there
was one

SHERMAN

I‘m doing this under protest

He dials in the oxytocin as Maya offers the clothes up for
each raptor to sniff-

NICK
We should repeat this every day
till the mission That smell is
all theyll have to track her down

EXT VALLEY - PRACTICE BUILDINGS - ANOTHER DAY

Four PRACTICE BUILDINGS shells that have been rigged up to
resemble what weve seen in the waterfront quarter stand not

too far from the chute-

Three of the raptors- Spartacus Perseus and Orestes- trot
out of the chute each now wearing something like a FLAK VEST
strapped around their bodies They cluster together-

freezing-

It is a DUMMY of a small GIRL dressed like Isabel Chartiers

FADE TO BLACK

EXT DOCKSIDE - TANGIER - NIGHT

A big TRUCK pulls up at the edge of the decaying Tangier
waterfront a battered SUV gliding to a stop next to it-

The tailgate of the truck swings down hydraulically becoming
a RAMP-

Spartacus Perseus and Orestes step down the ramp They are
rigged up in the protective armor with the addition of a
small night-vision VIDEO CAMERA on each mounted on the
shoulder-

SUV - NICK

The INTERIOR of the SUV is totally different than its
outside Very high-tech with three MONITORS being fed by
each of the raptors letting us know what they see-

Nick is wearing a pheromone armband and a speaker set on his
head leaving his hands free-

NICK

PERSEUS

Perseus pauses by an ancient two-story WAREHOUSE A faded
SIGN indicates it has something to do with olive oil

Perseus sniffs then lifts his head and opers his jaws wide
calling ultra-sonically Spartacus then Crestes appear to
join him They put their heads together facing the building-

SUV - NICK

Nick gets a good look at the building from the raptors’
cameras checks on his locator grid-

NICK
(into radio) Looks like weve got
something- Sector twelve building
three-six-two-

He brings the SUV to a stop unhooks his seatbelt and lifts a
short-barrelled AUTOMATIC WEAPON from the seat beside him-

(muttering to himself) Let’s just
hope it’s not a meat-packing plant

WAREHOUSE
Perseus stays by the FRONT ENTRANCE as—
Orestes moves around back to the LOADING DOCK-

And Spartacus painstakingly climbs the FIRE ESCAPE that leads
up to a second floor WINDOW-

INT WAREHOUSE

We are inside the warehouse on the GROUND FLOOR rows of
BARRELS full of OLIVE OIL taking up much of the space We
move past them to see a trio of KIDNAPPERS asleep on cots

weapons within arms reach-

Four MORE KIDNAPPERS sit at a small table under a harsh light
playing cards their weapons propped against chair legs or
lying on the table-

We CONTINUE past these men to a set of iron STAIRS CRANING
UP to the second-floor LOFT We push through an open door
into the old OFFICE-

Two MCRE KIDNAPPERS sleep on mattresses on the floor while a
third sits near the window feet up on the ancient desk Uzi
on his lap yawning and nodding off-

In the middle of the room curled up in a big upholstered
EASY CHAIR with the stuffing coming out the arms is ISABEL
CHARTIERS-

EXT STREET - NIGHT

Nick is out of the SUV now ready to roll looking in through
the window at the grid locator-

The raptors represented by three BLINKING RED DOTS have
surrounded the building-

Nick tense speaks low into his headset-
NICK
All together boys You’re go to
enter-
EXT WAREHOUSE - FIRE ESCAPE LADDER SPARTACUS

We watch the claws of Spartacus’ foot grip the next rung up-

He shifts his weight ever so slowly the fire escape metal
CREAKING just a bit One more step- he’s up on the platform
looking in the window-

INT OFFICE

The kidnapper at the desk is nearly asleep his back to the
window as the massive head appears behind him peering in-

EXT FIRE ESCAPE

Spartacus calls in ultra-sound then-

INT WAREHOUSE - OFFICE

SMASH Spartacus thrusts his head through the window ROARS
then grabs the dozing kidnapper in his Jaws the man
SCREAMING as he is lifted and shaken

GROUND FLOOR

WHAM Perseus batters his way through the front entrance
door sprawling off-balance knocking into piled BARRELS and
sending them crashing to and rolling on the floor

CRASH RIP Orestes begins to tear apart the metal loading
dock DOOR in the rear-

The kidnappers at the table grab for their weapons but BAM
Perseus charges through them splintering the table with a
mighty blow and sending the men flying-

INT COMMAND WAREHOUSE
The mercenaries grab weapons and run out-

JOYCE
Go Go Go

As they run out we TILT DOWN to a MONITOR We see a
TERRIFIED KIDNAPPER firing his weapon toward the camera-

INT OLIVE OIL WAREHOUSE - OFFICE

Spartacus has smashed his way in through the window the two
men on the mattresses awake now and Bap-bap-bap-bap-bap-bap

FIRING at him

ISABEL

Isabel is sitting up confused and terrified- she ducks as a
deinonychus foot clamps onto the arm of the chair Spartacus
using it as a springboard to leap across the room onto the

kidnappers

Isabel throws her blanket over her head and curls into fetal
position We hear THRASHING and SCREAMING-
®)

GROUND FLOCR

Bap-bap-bap-bap-bap-bap The kidnappers scatter FIRING
their weapons tripping over barrels and upended furniture
sliding on the olive-oil-slicked floor-

-but both Orestes and Perseus are in now and in full attack
mode- leaping sliding stabbing with their sickle-claws
grabbing men in their jaws and hurling them across the rocm

Two of the kidnappers duck cut the front entrance-

One kidnapper tries to run up the iron stairs to the office
He gets halfway up when CHOMP Orestes nails him from behind-

EXT STREET - NIGHT

Nick is hurrying down the street toward the warehouse The
two escaped kidnappers come rushing around the corner see
him- Bap-bap-bap-bap-bap-bap they open up with their Uzis
Nick diving for cover behind the burnt-out hulk of a tire-
less ABANDONED CAR-

ROUNDS smash into the wreck tearing chunks of metal off
around Nicks head Not the greatest cover-

We shoot from profile as the kidnappers walk toward Nick
FIRING as they come-

We change angle- were fifty yards behind them and coming
fast- WHAM Perseus flattens one of the men running over
him from behind then wheels and jumps on the other tearing
at him

Nick jumps up and runs past the raptor to the warehouse-

INT WAREHOUSE - GROUND FLOOR

Nick enters through the front entrance We FOLLOW him as he
steps over smashed barrels busted furniture discarded
weapons dead bodies and spreading puddles of olive oil He
pauses at the foot of the iron stairs listens Quiet He
calls up-

NICK
It’s me Im coming up

He changes channels on his headset speaks more softly-
‘oe

NICK
Im in the building no resistance
apparent Shut them down Repeat-
shut them down now

He climbs the iron staircase weapon at ready squeezing by a
kidnapper’s BODY hanging upside-down He reaches the top
steps into the office-—

Spartacus and Orestes face him one side of Spartacus’ head a
mess BLOOD dripping down from it Spartacus stands with one
foot resting on the overturned easy chair They look wild-
eyed and not shut down at all but don‘t attack-

Nick takes a step forward Spartacus HISSES Nick freezes
looks around at the devastation in the room- BLOOD on the
walls mattresses torn to shreds one BODY hanging half out
of the window--

NICK
Where is she

Spartacus GROWLS-
NICK
Youve done good work here
Outstanding Where is the girl
He sees the chair beneath the raptor’s foot-

NICK
Back Move back

Spartacus hesitates then slowly steps away from the chair
not taking his eyes off Nick Orestes is starting to nod as
the radio-controlled neuropeptides do their work-

Nick steps forward lifts the chair away-

A small figure under a blanket not moving—

Nick takes the edge of the blanket lifts-

EXT WAREHOUSE - STREET

A half-dozen VEHICLES screech to halt in front of the
warehouse mercenaries jumping out fully armed-

She points-

Nick steps out of the warehouse with Tsabel in his arms the
little girl clutching at his neck and regarding the
mercenaries with wide eyes as he carries her through them to

Maya at the AMBULANCE-

ISABEL
Sont réels les monstres que j‘avais
vue (Were those monsters I saw
real)

NICK
Non non- cest seulement un réve
(No- it’s only a dream)

Nick hands Isabel off to a MEDIC-

NICK
Ces gens tu portez a tes parents
Cest fini ton cauchemar (These

parents Your nightmare is all
over)

Joyce is ecstatic-

JOYCE
Not a scratch on her How are the

NICK

Spartacus is shot up pretty bad
Theres- theres a lot of cleaning

up to do in there

Joyce signals to Zeiss-

JOYCE
Get on it

The mercenaries hurry into the warehouse Maya steps close
to Nick-

MAYA

Nick grins He is stoked from the action the success of the
rescue-
‘eo

NICK
Never better

EXT CASTLE - NIGHT

FLOODLIGHTS illuminate the COURTYARD of the castle as a
HELICOPTER lowers and settles onto the ground Von Drax and
his house staff are waiting and break into APPLAUSE as Nick

and the others step out of the chopper-

INT DINING HALL - CHAMPAGNE BOTTLE

Von Drax is at the head of the table toasting Nick Joyce
Maya and Sherman-

They raise their glasses and drink-

VON DRAX

INT STRATEGY ROOM - TABLE MODEL - DAY

We look down on a TABLE TOP MODEL of an extensive jungle
fortress-- checkpoints guardhouses barracks drug
processing buildings and a lavish hacienda-style home-

JOYCE (0S)
Pepe Aguilar controls a large
percentage of the heroin and
cocaine still moving out from Latin

America

and
e

JOYCE
He has a private army his own
fleet of cargo planes ana here at
Cuchikamba a state-of-the-art
processing plant

Joyce and Nick regard the layout Nick neds to the BLCOW-UPS
of AERIAL PHOTOS mounted on the wall-

NICK
So bomb it off the map

JOYCE
Aguilar also keeps several dozen
prisoners in the compound-
kidnapped members of prominent
families politicians from all the
major and minor parties and most
importantly the president’s
favorite niece He’s way back in
the jungle here- to make a
surprise attack with the number of
ground troops youd need-

NICK
It wouldn’t be much of a surprise

JOYCE
Its the perfect scenario for our
very unique services Penetrate
their defenses and eliminate Pepe
Aguilar-

NICK
-without hurting the hostages
This isn’t a special ops mission
its an invasion

JOYCE
(nods) I suspect well need the
whole team this time

EXT MOUNTAIN VALLEY - ENCLOSURE
Nick Maya Sherman and mercenary team face a pair of

SPITTERS through the bars of the enclosure Both have
control implants on their heads-

NICK
These things were on the island

SHERMAN
(shrugs) They seem to thrive
underground Hard to track them
all down-

NICK
Were they bio-engineered

Sherman flips down the plexiglas faceplate on his SAFETY
HELMET takes three steps toward the enclosure-

SHERMAN
Not to the extent the deinonychus
are but they’re relatively
controllable Chlymidosaurus

sputori- ‘chlymidosaurus meaning
‘frilled lizard’ and sputori
meaning-

One of the spitters raises its spiny mantle and hawks a plug
of sticky BLACK MUCUS CHHHHHOKKK ---

-through the air where it sticks SPLAT to Sherman’s
faceplate-

SHERMAN
-well you get the idea Weve
trained these spitters with the
idea that there might be some tight
spaces we need access to-

NICK
(naming them) From now on they’re
Casper and Pollux
Sherman wipes his faceplate clean looks at the spitters-

SHERMAN
Which is which

Casper and Pollux emerge from the CHUTE followed by the five
deinonychus All are fitted with body armor and shoulder
mounted cameras-

INT HUMVEE
Nick speaks into his headset-

NICK
Squad forward to objective
Maximum alert

They watch the monitors as the animals head cautiously for
the trees-

NICK
youd think that the big ones would
just eat the little ones

SHERMAN
We threw a chlymidosaurus in with
the big boys early on Theyve got
glands full of that toxin they
expectorate-

MAYA
The deinonychus were sick for days

NICK
I bet the spitter wasn‘t too
thrilled about it either

EXT WOODS

Casper and Pollux lead the squad slightly spread out
through the woods Casper suddenly stops HISSING his spiny

MANTLE popping out-

He is standing a few inches from a TRIP WIRE about a two
feet high that runs from tree to tree-

The deinonychus carefully step over the wire as the spitters
furiously dig quickly burrowing under it-

INT HUMVEE

The humans watch on the dino-cam monitors-

The squad has come to a spot where the trees thin out and we
can see a metal FENCE ahead eight feet high with CONCERTINA

On two of the monitors we see the POV as the bearer rushes
toward the fence-

EXT TREES

Spartacus and Hector are sprinting full tilt toward the fence
as the others trot behind them WHAM they leap in unison

It’s Achilles--
NICK
Shut him down

WHAM another charging head-butt and the tower is at a forty-
five degree angle wood beginning to CRACK and give way-

JOYCE
Shut him off Shut him off

Achilles takes another running start this time jumping on
the side of the tower his weight bringing it CRASHING to the
ground The men roll out of the crow’s nest the mercenary
coming up FIRING Bap-bap-bap-bap-bap but Achilles sileces
him with a deadly downward swipe of his sickle-claw

HUMVEE

NICK
Off Shut them off all of them

SHERMAN
I have They should be
unconscious

WHAM Achilles hits the Humvee broadside with his head and
they are rolled upside down Nick tries to clear his pistol
as Sherman freaks-

SHERMAN
Oh please don’t eat me don’t eat me
dont eat me

Quiet Very quiet Then a face appears at the passenger-
side window Nick whipping his gun around-

JOYCE
Easy He’s down

ACHILLES

The deinonychus lies on his side breathing shallowly a
glazed look on his eyes as Nick Maya and Joyce approach
Sherman sits on the side of the flipped Humvee behind them
shaking uncontrollably-

JOYCE
A berserker Weve had problems
with him before

NICK
I think he knew exactly what he was
doing

SHERMAN

The response time on all of them
keeps getting longer-

MAYA
They’re not machines You cant
just point your finger and expect
them to kill whoever you-

JOYCE
Are you suggesting that they have a

conscience

MAYA
It would be nice if someone around

here did

JOYCE
If youre not behind the program
Maya you can always-

MAYA
Quit Id be dead before I got

across the moat

Its out in the open now Joyce and Maya glaring at each
other Zeiss returns rifle in hand-

Looks like they were just taking
care of business

He gives Achilles a hard kick in the ribs-

ZEISS
Its just this son of a-

MAYA
He sees and hears everything you
do

ZEISS

Not for long

Zeiss buts the barrel of the rifle to Achilles’ temple-

JOYCE
Belay that We need to know what
went wrong here (calls to

Sherman) I want a full work-up on
him and a report tomorrow morning
We don’t have time for this

Maya is looking down at the BODY of the slain mercenary-

MAYA
What about him

JOYCE
(shrugs) Accidents happen

He steps close her menacing-

JOYCE
Which is why we must ali be very
careful

EXT COURTYARD - EVENING

The courtyard is lit up with TORCHES Baron von Drax is
engaging in some target practice- shooting bolts from an
ancient CROSSBOW across the courtyard to SHATTER porcelain
VASES that have been set up in a row Joyce looks on as
Kroner reloads the crossbow after every shot-

NICK

Nick steps out from the base of the tower just as SMASH a
vase is shattered only a few feet from him Zeiss stands
behind him armed-

NICK
Nice shot

VON DRAX
I am an expert with several archaic
weapons

NICK
Very useful if you run into some
archaic enemies

VON DRAX
And what about you Mr Harris-- are
you a friend or an enemy

NICK
An employee (nods to Zeiss) He
says you wanted to see me

VON DRAX
(indicates) Would you mind placing
another vase on the stand for me

Nick picks up a vase from the ground-
‘e

NICK
These look expensive

VON DRAX
Priceless But I’m tired of them

Nick reaches to put the vase on the target stand- SMASH von
Drax shoots it out of his hand Nick looks at his hand cut
and bleeding then calmly turns to face the Baron-

VON DRAX
As I am tired of waiting for you to
return our property

NICK
We don’t really have a deal do we

VON DRAX
Your payment

NICK
My payment isn’t much good unless
I’m free to spend it

von Drax points the reloaded crossbow at Nicks head-

VON DRAX
You wish to leave us

Nick walks slowly across the courtyard straight at von Drax
Joyce watches his boss tense not sure the Baron won‘t pull
the trigger-

JOYCE
(mutters) We need him-

Nick stops only a few feet away from the deadly crossbow He
speaks softly-

NICK
You‘re keeping Maya here She
wants to go

VON DRAX
Miss Lundberg is not one of our
more enthusiastic employees no
but it wouldn’t be prudent to-

NICK
You let her leave no strings no
repercussions and I tell you where
I left the aerosol can
‘e

pened

S6

JOYCE
if she talks about what were doing
here-

NICK

After the demonstration youll be
begging for publicity The whole
point of a strike force like this
one is to intimidate the people who
don’t have one

JOYCE
And if we let her go then you‘ll
stay with the program

NICK
Like you said- it’s what I was
meant to do

shifts the aim of the crossbow ever so

Von Drax smiles
SMASH

slightly and FIRES it past Nick’s ear

theyve been going at it for hours

OBSERVATION BOOTH - NICK AND MAYA

Nick and Maya look in from the booth Achilles CALLS again-

NICK
He’s telling them about his escape
attempt Like any other good
prisoner We used a tapping code

MAYA
Do you think all that was planned
today

NICK

Somebody has to test the envelope
see how far you can get-

MAYA
What Sherman did today would have
killed this animal a month ago
Their brains must be developing new
pathways rearranging circuitry
like people do after a stroke-

RRRRRRRRAGHHHHHH Achilles screams staring defiantly at the
two of them-

NICK
LI told them where the embryos were
MAYA
(horrified) Nick no Why would
you-
NICK

As soon as this demonstration is
over no matter how it goes youre
free to walk

MAYA
And you trust them

NICK
No But I’ll work for them

MAYA
How can you say that

all through history like weapons
The only question is whos using
them and what for

Maya looks at him for a long moment glances up-—

Maya leans forward and kisses Nick She breaks off the kiss
leans her lips close to his ear WHISPERS—

We see into Nick’s eyes as he realizes the nature of the

INT SECURITY ROOM - NIGHT

A SECURITY GUARD writes down his observations as he watches

parked on a narrow LOGGING ROAD behind him-

He looks at his watch then at the sky-

We hear the DRONE of AIRPLANES-

EXT JUNGLE VILLAGE

A small VILLAGE with a RIVER on one side and the JUNGLE WALL
on the other-

A half-dozen MILITARY VEHICLES of various sorts are parked in
the center of the village MERCENARIES waiting around for

orders-

INT HQ BUILDING

Inside the biggest structure a COMMAND HEADQUARTERS has been
set up A bank of DINO-CAM MONITORS takes up one wall
manned by a pair of GRENDEL TECHNICIANS-

REPRESENTATIVES some in military unifcrm some not from
Asia Europe Africa Latin America and Russia mill around

waiting for the show to start-

Joyce stands nervously looking at his watch as Baron von
Drax chats in German with a uniformed COLONEL nearby
presenting him with a HALBERD from his collection-

The Colonel poses for a SNAPSHOT with the weapon-

Sherman checks his BIO-METERS as Maya sits nearby glumly
regarding the scene-

TECHNICIAN
Weve got them

Hub-bub in many languages as the spectators cross to watch
the monitors Joyce acts as master of ceremonies-

JOYCE
Though the objective is not a great
distance from here we felt that
any demonstration of our special
capabilities should include an
aerial insertion-

MONITORS

On most of the monitors we see images too dark or fuzzy to
interpret Suddenly on one we see the CARGO DOOR ofa
TRANSPORT aircraft slide open and the camera is launched into
open air as its bearer jumps out ANOTHER and ANOTHER of the
monitors show the same image open SKY then bits of the
JUNGLE below-

RUSSIAN OBSERVER
What is big deal Dropping weapons
from plane-

A collective GASP as on one monitor Orestes suspended from a
PARACHUTE swings into frame

JOYCE
(smug) That gentlemen is the big
deal

EXT CLEARING — SKY

The sky is full of PARACHUTES floating earthward with
dinosaurs hanging from them-—

We TILT to Nick who shakes his head in amazement then
speaks into his headset-

NICK
Squad form and proceed to target
Youre on your own felias

He gets onto the ATV shoots a last look at the sky then
motors away down the logging road-

SKY - SPARTACUS

We drift down shooting past Spartacus toward the clearing
from under the canopy of the chute His powerful legs easily
take up the shock of landing-

POP the BUCKLES on his chute HARNESS separate with a small
explosion and the harness falls away Spartacus stepping away
from it We see other squad members making similar landings

in the BG-

INT HQ BUILDING

The spectators are amazed as they watch-

Captured on another creatures camera we see CASPER hang up
in a tree at the edge of the clearing chute snagged on
branches-—

JOYCE (0S)
I must inform you that this is the
first jump our operatives have
undertaken-

POP the harness releases and Casper falls a few feet before
snatching a branch with his tail then swinging to grab the
trunk of the tree before shinnying down quick as a squirrel-

JOYCE
But as you see they are somewhat
more resilient than conventional
forces

EXT CLEARING

The squad quickly melt into the jungle at the far side of the
clearing-

EXT JUNGLE VILLAGE

Nick pulls up in the ATV hurries into the HQ building-

Nick crosses to Joyce glancing at the dino-cam images of
jungle being traversed-

JOYCE
I thought wed lose at least one

NICK
How do the bio readouts look

SHERMAN
(watching meters) The heart-rates
went through the roof when we
dumped them out of the plane but
they’re back in predator mode
already

Nick is distracted as he sees a half-dozen narco-looking
CHARACTERS watching one of the monitors-

NICK
Who are they

JOYCE
Those are the gentlemen who hired

us

NICK
They look just like the bunch we’re
trying to take out

JOYCE
A rival group They’ve made a deal
with the government and their end
of it starts with eliminating Pepe

Aguilar

NICK
We’re working for drug-runners

JOYCE

EXT JUNGLE - DAY

The raptors move rapidly through thick jungle Spartacus in
the lead stops to sniff the air The others freeze behind

him alert-

Spartacus makes a low GRUNT and Casper and Pollux move
forward The others follow the two spitters more slowly now-

POLLUX

The spitter slinks with his belly close to the ground head
low barely disturbing the underbrush Suddenly he pops his

head up and CHLLLLLLOK spits-—

EXT JUNGLE

A PERIMETER GUARD is out walking sentry at the edge of the
jungle pacing listening He stops by a tree pulls out a
cigarette lights it- suddenly a SPITTER swings down inches
from his face hanging upside-down from a branch by its tail
and SNAP grabs the startled mans face in its jaws

Several of the deinonychus pass the grisly scene hopping
like kangaroos over a two-foot-high TRIP WIRE strung between

the trees-

(There‘s no sign of anybody Well

We let the squad exit frame HOLD a beat then Spartacus and
Perseus seem to MATERIALIZE from the jungle before our eyes
their chameleon-like camouflage and ability to freeze still
so effective that we were staring at them all the while
They move off in the opposite direction-

INT MACHINE-GUN BUNKER

Two MACHINE-GUNNERS peer out at the jungle through camo-
netting crouched behind their MACHINE GUN in a dirt-floored

bunker listening hard-

underwear smoking reading magazines watching a GAMERA
(giant Japanese turtle that emits flames from its butt when
it flies to the rescue) MOVIE on a BIG SCREEN TV-

WHAM Orestes bursts in the front entrance
WHAM Achilles bursts in the rear entrance

BEDLAM as the deinonychus charge in from opposite ends
slashing tearing chomping at the SCREAMING terror-stricken

narcos

EXT COMPOUND - TOWER

Bap-bap-bap-bap-bap-bap A MACHINE GUN opens up on the main
TOWER as Spartacus and Orestes streak into the compound
Hector scrambles up the side of the tower and CHOMP deals
with the SENTRY

A half-dozen NARCOS come running out of the long rectangular
DRUG LAB BLASTING away with their weapons as Spartacus
charges straight at them rounds smacking into his body armor-

POUNCE Orestes leaps on tep of the men from the ROOF behind
them flattening a pair and then tearing into the others-

INT SACUZZI ROOM

PEPE AGUILAR wearing nothing but a lot of gold chains kicks
back in his enormous JACUZZI water-jets churning away with
a pifia colada in hand and SALSA MUSIC on the stereo He
locks up surprised to be interrupted as a BODYGUARD hustles
in-

BODYGUARD
Nos atacamos
(Were being attacked)

PEPE AGUILAR

Pepe starts to LAUGH-

PEPE AGUILAR
Ha sido probando el producto otra
vez Agui preparamos las drogas

(You’ve been sampling the product
again We make drugs here- we
don’t take them)

The Bodyguard lays an Uzi at the edge of the jacuzzi and
hurries away-

BODYGUARD
Le dejo esto
(I’11 leave this for you)

We HOLD on Pepe shaking his head-
PEPE AGUILAR
Guardaespaldas pendejos

(Idiot bodyguards )

He takes a drink closes his eyes and sinks back into the
CHURNING WATER-

EXT COMPOUND PRISONER CORRAL

All around we hear sporadic GUNFIRE and human SCREAMS as
Spartacus kills the GUARD in front of a fenced-in area then
CLANG tears the gate off its hinges-

A couple dozen PRISONERS kidnapped by the narcos cower
against the back fence as Spartacus steps in ROARS then
lowers his head to sniff at the petrified occupants-

WOMAN
Se acabo Se acabo el mundo
(It’s the end It’s the end of the

world)

Spartacus straightens ROARS again and exits A few of the
prisoners fall of their knees to give thanks for their
salvation-

COURTYARD

GUNFIRE and SCREAMS continue as we FOLLOW a trio of narcos
who jump into an SUV and patch out swerving to avoid
Orestes who is busy demolishing a GUARDHOUSE-

The SUV hurtles toward the exit gate but-

The ANKYLOSAURUS last to arrive is just coming in its huge
armored body filling the opening

The driver slams on the brakes throwing the SUV into a
sideways skid DUST billowing up till SMASH it hits the
ankylosaurus and flips over its back landing behind it on
its side

WHAM WHAM WHAM The beast instinctively begins to smash
the metal attacker flat with the club on its powerful tail-

INT DRUG LAB

Hector charges through the long DRUG LAB chasing terrified
WORKERS before him APPARATUS smashing all around as he
rampages through and over the tables leaving WHITE POWDER
flying sizzling CHEMICAL SPILLS and a spreading FIRE in his
wake-

The narcos who have hired Grendel are dismayed as they see
the lab trashed on EECTOK’S MONITOR-

Theyre inside Pepe’s mansion now

INT PEPE’S MANSION - PORTRAIT

A PORTRAIT of Pepe dressed slick and leaning on a red
Porshe hangs on the wall- SPLAT SSSSSSSSSS A plug of
SPITTER MUCUS hits the portrait and bubbles the acid in it
burning the canvas-

we PAN to the HALLWAY decorated in very expensive very bad
taste where the BODYGUARD sprints past FIRING the occasional
shot behind as Casper chases after him He ducks around the
corner- we hear a ROAR and a SCREAM and then Orestes trots
from around the corner with the Bodyguard still struggling
in his jaws

LOBBY - STAIRCASE

TROPICAL PLANTS adorn the ostentatious LOBBY that leads to a
curving marble STAIRCASE A pair of NARCOS come running down
the staircase one tripping and sprawling down end-over-end
and the other gaining the ground floor and running straight
at us but-

Perseus appears above him leaping over the bannister and
landing with both feet THUMP right on top of the man

INT JACUZZI ROOM

Pepe hearing the SCREAMS and GUNFIRE outside now has the
Uzi in hand and a worried look on his face BAM BAM BAM
Something is battering the vault door that protects him-

HALLWAY

A FIRE has started further down the hallway SMOKE starting
to billow as the ankylosaurus pounds the VAULT DOOR again and
again with his tail the wall around the door starting to
CRUMBLE- the smoke envelops the beast just as CRASH the
whole section of wall and door fall inward

INT JACUZZI ROOM

Pepe stands in the middle of the still-churning jacuzzi doing
his Scarface routine Uzi pointed and ready trying to see
through the smoke-—

PEPE AGUILAR
Bueno- quieres jugar
(Come on- you want to play)

Suddenly the two spitters leap through the smoke mantles
puffed out SHREIKING and land SPLASH SPLASH smack in the

jacuzzi with Pepe

We hear SCREAMING SPLASHING SNARLING as BLOOD sprays on the
fluffy white towels hanging on the wall-

Toppled TOWERS-

The trashed burning interior of the LAB-

BODIES and furniture strewn around in the BARRACKS On the
huge TV lying on its side now Gamera is saving small
Japanese children-

The ANKYLOSAURUS is peacefully grazing on the tropical
foliage in the LOBBY of Pepes mansion BLOOD SMEARS on the

white marble floor and staircase-
BLOOD fills the still churning JACUZZI-

The kidnapped PRISONERS cautiously step out from their
enclosure for a look-

Achilles’ ear

JOYCE
Well we can’t back up all the way

SHERMAN

a quarter mile away and coming
fast

DRIVERS and OBSERVERS are popping out of their vehicles now
to see what the holdup is The Baron calls impatient—

VON DRAX
Why do we wait

JOYCE
There’s a problem on the road
ahead

VON DRAX

What could be the pr- (sees) Mein
Gott in Himmel

We WHIP PAN to see the squad of raptors tearing down the road
toward the convoy

Everyone jumps back into their vehicles and there is a
desperate automotive scramble as they all try to turn around
and speed away at once resulting in something like a
demolition derby vehicles SMASHING into each other and into
trees getting stuck in the muck alongside the road and then-

RRRRRRRRRRRRRAAAWWWWWWWGH Spartacus and his squad hit the
convoy like a tidal wave butting slashing kicking
knocking the small vehicles over and stomping on the larger
ones-

One MERCENARY is plucked clean off his MOTORCYCLE by Hector
while another dodges away only to have Pollux leap onto the
back of it and wrap his arms around the MOTORCYCLIST The
guy glances back to see who is hitchhiking SCREAMS as the
spitter opens its jaws

The NARCOS’ CAR one tire slashed and bumping and the
MERCEDES carrying the Baron manage to turn and speed away—

In Nicks car SMASH a deinonychus foot busts through the
windshield sickle-claw pinning Zeiss to his seat Nick and
Maya bail out their doors-

Orestes and Perseus pursue a half-dozen OBSERVERS into the
jungle WHUMP Slade thoroughly chewed-upon falls from
above and lands hard on top of an SUV

INT MERCEDES

Baron von Drax looks over his DRIVER’s shoulder The narco
car ahead is fishtailing unable to make speed and hold the
road with the front tire blown-

VON DRAX

VON DRAX
Then push it out of the way

The Driver mashes the gas pedal-

LOGGING ROAD

The vehicles blast towards us the Mercedes catching the tail
of the narco car and WHAM knocking it sideways to head-on
against a roadside tree One narco flies over us through the
windshield and the Mercedes blows by Achilles peels off to
attack the remaining narcos as they stagger out of the wreck
and Spartacus continues after the Baron’s ride-

CRUNCH CLAWS punch through the roof above the drivers
head RIP The roof is pulled open like the lid of a
sardine can The Driver loses control the Mercedes slewing
sideways and SMASH coming to rest on its side in the trees
Baron von Drax climbs out of the totalled Mercedes over the
dead body of the Driver-

He stands turns-- Spartacus towers over him ROARING-

VON DRAX
Nein Nein Du bist mein kind

But Spartacus is not moved by this profession of kinship and
IMPALES von Drax with a thrust of his sickle-claw

SHERMAN

Sherman one lens knocked out of his glasses and bleeding
from the scalp clumsily but hastily climbs a tree-
CONVOY

smashed and upended vehicles litter the logging road Quiet
now

Maya crawls out from under a trashed Humvee right into the
legs of-

-Joyce Claw-marks and blood on his chest pistol in his
hand still a little stunned-

JOYCE
They didn’t stop No insulin no
adrenaline-

MAYA
Willpower

Joyce turns his attention to her points his pistol-

JOYCE

JOYCE
No reason to think they won’t kill

MAYA

No reason

He brings the pistol very close aiming right between her
eyes-

JOYCE
Ill save them the trouble-

WHOOOMP Nick flies out of nowhere tackling Joyce and
BLAM the pistol going off as they hit the ground

They roll trading punches struggling to strangle each
other the pistol left on the ground-

Joyce kicks Nick off him rolls to his knees looks about-—

The HALBERD von Drax gave to the Colonel lies on the ground
just beside him

Joyce comes up with the halberd and SWISH SWISH swings it
expertly tauntingly at Nick backing him up toward the trees—
1l7

JOYCE
I was wrong about you Nick 1
thought you were smart I thought
theyd baked all the idealism out
of your skull in that POW camp

SWISH He takes a mighty swing Nick just able to duck uncer
it-
Maya pounces on the discarded PISTOL aims pulls the triqger-

Out of ammo

Joyce swings slicing Nick across the shoulder Nick backing
up warily BLEEDING-

JOYCE
How did you do it Nick How did
you sabotage this

NICK
They did it on their own They
watched and waited-

Joyce makes a rush and Nick falls backwards over a root He
is helpless at Joyce’s feet Joyce with the halberd raised
over his head like a woodsman about to chop-

JOYCE
Theyre animals Nick Throw them
a bone and they‘1l do what you want—

He hears a METAL SOUND as something behind him steps on car
debris whirls and THUNK buries the halberd blade into the
armored chest of Achilles tottering above him

Achilles ROARS grabs the halberd shaft and yanks it out of
his armor He drops it and lunges for Joyce

Nick scrambles away on his hands and knees as we hear Joyce
SCREAMING as he’s torn to bits-

Achilles drops Jcoyce’s body to the ground turns to step
toward Nick-

MAYA
Achilles no Stop-

BLOOD is pumping out of the WOUND in the raptor’s neck his
eyes swimming in and out of focus his blood sugar all used
up He turns to look at Maya tilting his head trying to

understand-

He takes another step then FALLS like tall timber-

MAYA
Nick

Maya starts toward him but is cut off by Casper the spitter
darting in front of her HISSING and DISPLAYING

NICK
Don’t move

Spartacus and the others come out of the trees ringing
around them Spartacus sniffs Maya’s body and face Maya
standing absolutely still looking him in the eye-

He steps away rolls Achilles’ body over with his foot
sniffs it then Nick- and then straightens He TRUMPETS in
triumph and trots off into the trees the rest of the squad
following

Maya runs to Nick who is examining his bleeding shoulder-

MAYA
Are you all right

NICK
First time I’ve been wounded with a
fifteenth century weapon How far
you think they’1ll get without
insulin

Maya looks into the jungle where the raptors disappeared-

MAYA
Hard to say

He puts his arm over her shoulder and they walk away from us
back down the logging road toward the village-

MAYA
So where are the embryos The real
