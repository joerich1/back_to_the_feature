JAWS

1 OVER BLACK

Sounds of the innerspaces rushing forward

Then a splinter of blue light in the center of the picture
It breaks wide showing the top and bottom a silhouetted
curtain of razor sharp teeth suggesting that we are inside
of a tremendous gullet looking out at the onrushing under-
sea world at night HEAR a symphony of underwater sounds
landslide metabolic sounds the rare and secret noises that
certain undersea species share with each other

CUT TO

2 EXT LIGHTHOUSE - NIGHT

Caught in its blinding flash the light moves on fingering
the fog A lone buoy dongs somewhere out at sea

3 EXT AMITY MAINSTREET - NIGHT

The quaint little resort town is quiet in the middle of the
night A ground fog rounds a corner and begins spreading
toward us It fills over sidewalks and streets like some
Biblical plague

EXT THE SOUTH SHORE OF LONG ISLAND - NIGHT

It is a pleasant moonlit windless night in mid-June We see
a long straight stretch of white beach Behind the low dunes
are the dark shapes of large expensive houses The fog that
has reached Amity proper is seen only as a low-hanging cloud
that is pushing in from the sea HEAR a number of voices sing-
ing It sounds like an Eastern Universitys Alma Mater

ANOTHER ANGLE - BEACH

A bonfire is blazing Gathered around it are about a dozen
young men and women who are merrily trading fight songs from
their respective universities Two young people break away
from the circle Chrissie almost pulling a drunk and disorderly
Tom Cassidy behind her

CLOSEUP - CASSIDY

makes a clumsy try at kissing Christina but she laughs and
ducks away

ANOTHER PART OF THE BEACH

The fire now one hundred yards in the bg silhouettes
Chrissie running up a steep dune Once there she pauses to
look at the ocean that we can only hear Cassidy plods up
the dune behind her grossly out of shape

Chrissie runs down a few steps leaving Tom Cassidy reeling
on the summit Chrissies dress bra and panties fly toward
Tom who cant make a fist to catch them The dress drapes
over one half of his head Soggily aroused Cassidy struggles
to get his shoe off

But Chrissie is already in full flight toward the shore In
she goes a delicate splash surfacing in a cold ocean that is
unusually placid Chrissie pulls with her arms drawing
herself into deeper water

Thats when we see it A gentle bulge in the water a ripple
that passes her a dozen feet away A wave of pressure lifts

her up and eases her down again Her face shows the beginning
of fear Maybe its Tom She smiles and looks around for him
then her eyes go to the beach where Tom -- too drunk to stand

-- one pantleg off is struggling with his other shoe Chrissie
turns and starts for shore

CLOSE - CHRISSIE

Her expression freezes The water-lump is racing for her

httpwww script-o-ramaconysnazzydircuthtml

It bolts her upright out of the water to her hips then slams
her hard whipping her in an upward arc of eight feet before
she is jerked down to her open mouth Another jolt to her
floating hair One hand claws the air fingers trying to
breathe then it too is sucked below in a final and terrible
jerking motion HOLD on the churning froth of a baby whirl-
pool until we are sure it is over

9 ANGLE - CASSIDY

in his undershorts laughing turning in slow stoned circles
a prisoner in his orange windbreaker that seems to have him
in a full Nelson He stumbles to his knees

A pair of bumps under the bedsheets There is a rustling
and two stockinged feet swing up and settle heavily on the

11 INSERT - SCALE DIAL

In a blur it goes to 191 Then as if by magic the numbers
float backward to 160

12 ANGLE

Martin Brody at forty-two stands rigid lifting himself
from the sink counter-top with both hands Satisfied he
turns toward the mirror squinting in the light measuring
himself up and down Advancing waistline receding hairline
Gray around the ears Martin Brody makes another silent
promise to get his act together -- tomorrow

He reaches for the sliding mirror and opens the medicine
cabinet There is a travel brochure of Arizona attached
to the shelf Brody shakes his head and removes it He
closes the mirror which now reflects his wife Ellen Brody
pert and poised off to one side

ELLEN

Brody ripping open a twenty-five pound bag of Kennel Ration
as five hungry mutts somersault around his feet The tele-
phone rings and Brody one-hands it as he attempts to sow
all five doggy bowls with missed double-helpings

BRODY
Mornin Hendricks Whats what

He listens sours and takes a breath

BRODY

15 EXTERIOR - ISLAND HIGHWAY - MORNING

Martin Brodys Country Squire police wagon rushes past
taking the view to an enormous billboard depicting a
typical summer day in Amity A beautiful model splashes
in the golden surf languishing in a Solarcaine sun
AMITY WELCOMES YOU is written above her flailing arms

16 EXTERIOR - AMITY BEACH - DAY

Three small figures in the landscape walking the beach
The surf is rough and there is sea-floor debris strewn
about from the receding tide

17 CLOSER ANGLE

Deputy Hendricks is searching the shore about one hundred
yards down wind Meanwhile Brody in his casual police
attire and Tom Cassidy still in the clothing we saw him
in last night poke around the smoking ashes of the bon-
fire Brody fingers the missing girls shoes purse and
clothes In the daylight Cassidy looks like a junior in
High School and misconducts himself wavering between
inflated maturity and tear-blown adolescence

BRODY
Christine what

CASSIDY

You picked her up on the ferry

CASSIDY

BRODY
And nobody else saw her in the water

CASSIDY
Somebody couldve -- because I was
sort of passed out

BRODY
Sounds to me like maybe she ran out
on you

CASSIDY

Oh no sir Ive never had a
woman do that Im sure she drowned

A shrill whistle makes them turn Hendricks is fifty
yards away on his knees He blows again a feeble report

this time

BRODY
We may know in a minute

Brody runs toward Hendricks Cassidy hesitates then follows

with
CASSIDY
(pathetically)
You cant make me look --
18 MASTER ANGLE - THE SAND DUNE

A skein of seaweed garnishes the base of this isolated dune
The booming waves and fizzing surf make dialogue inaudible

Deputy Hendricks on hands and knees looking white as a
sheet Brody tells Cassidy to wait at the foot of the dune
and ventures up Hendricks stops him with a wave-off saying
something at the same time Brody nods understanding and
steps up cautiously And looks down

Whatever he sees has a marked effect on his entire physique
Kicking out with his foot Brody sends dozens of angry
horseshoe crabs in an escape frenzy and they boil over the
top of the dune and down its slopes

Cassidy takes a few uneasy steps backwards when Brody waves
him over He shakes his head An awkward moment Then
Cassidy shuffles forward and up the few remaining feet his
eyes looking everywhere but down Brody says something else
and Cassidy shakes his head again eyes out at sea Brody

puts his hand gently around the quaking mans shoulder
Nodding he starts to look down an inch at a time He looks

The jolt that assaults Cassidy is not unexpected He falls
backward in a sitting position as though shot Nods yes --
its her Brody turns and slides off the dune stumbling
close Hear his BREATHING He looks around envisioning
the week ahead of him

19 INTERIOR - BRODYS OFFICE - DAY

Brody walks through the door and enters his office holding
a fizzing glass of Alka-Seltzer Polly his sixty-one year
old secretary follows close on his heels with her shorthand
pad of messages and reminders

In the outer office Hendricks and Cassidy slump into chairs
sipping from fizzing dixie cups

Brody sits behind the typewriter only to find that somebody
has placed a travel folder to sunny Scottsdale Arizona
between the rolls of his Smith-Corona He sighs and replaces
the colorful brochure with the grim accident report As he
types Polly reads his calendar to him undaunted by Brodys
heavy malaise

POLLY
This is in no order of importance

Amity Town Council on Aging this

as Brody careens around the corner and out of sight Deputy
Hendricks laden with his arts and crafts passes them on
the street front

VAUGHN
What have you got there Lenny

HENDRICKS

Chop this morning Mayor Fatal
Gotta batten down the beach

httpwwwscript-o-ramacomsnazzydircuthtml (10 of 110)6152009 102946 PM
httpwww script-o-ramaconysnazzydircuthtml

Vaughn and group exchange horrified looks but we get the
impression it is not in response to the shark-attack news

VAUGHN
Whove you told this to Lenny

HENDRICKS
I just found out about it -- but
theres a bunch of Boy Scouts in
the water a coupla miles down the
coast from where we found the girl
Avril Bay thereabouts Chief
went to dry them off

VAUGHN
(to Meadows )
Take my car okay

jeep pulls up in the background and stops He gets out and
starts down to the breakwater when the Mayors Cadillac pulls
up and skids to a stop

Brody pauses momentarily as Mayor Vaughn emerges trying to
affect an easygoing appearance Reaching Brody he slips an
arm around his shoulder trying to slow him as Brody leads
the gang toward the breakwater and the slogging Scouts

VAUGHN
Where are you going to get the

authority to close the beaches

Brody stops He sees pitiful Hendricks standing by the car

httpwwwscript-o-ramacomsnazzydircuthtml (11 of 110)6152009 102946 PM
httpwww script-o-ramacomsnazzydircuthtml
with the signboard material Brody begins to slow burn

BRODY
Are you asking me as the Mayor or
as a Real Estate broker or our of
friendly interest or what Larry

VAUGHN
I just want you aware of what youre
doing before you tinker with the life
blood of all those sage and discriminating
souls who elected you Next weeks the
goddam Fourth of July Weve got a couple
thousand summer people coming over here
who will gladly use the Cape Cod beaches
if they cant use ours

BRODY
So what youre suggesting is we lay out
a smorgasbord for the shark All you can
eat for the price of a weekend on Amity
Island

VAUGHN
Were not even sure it was a shark

BRODY
What else could do that

VAUGHN
(to Coroner Santos)

httpwww script-o-ramacomsnazzydircuthtml
People react to them with their guts

Brody looks toward the open water The Boy Scouts have made
a turn and are passing the lifebuoy marking the three-quarter
mile point

MEADOWS
Whatever was out there is miles out
to sea by now Sharks dont have
swim bladders like most fish -- they
have to keep moving or drown Dont
you know anything about them

BRODY
Idont go around the water much

VAUGHN
Its one chance in a million thisll
happen again
(points)
Look at thatsafe and sound

The Boy Scouts are emerging exhausted some flop down on their
backs happy it is over Brody considers this

VAUGHN
Had you yelled shark those Cub
Scouts would have broken the free-
style record for the hundred-meter
then busted our backs with word of
mouth

BRODY
If thats the test case for your
million-to-one shot Im glad I lost

Vaughn feels secure that Brody will not act in haste He puts
a hand on his shoulder turns and walks him toward the cars

VAUGHN
Listen Chief -- the funniest thing --
you know the white picket fence
around my realty office

31 CLOSE QUINT

Rising like Neptune from out of the deep Quint walks the
sidewalk in the pool of his own shadow He is a sleek and
sinewy specimen inches over six feet and with a face making
it hard to determine where the scars leave off and the wrinkles
begin though he is no older than fifty

Quint seems to be heading for the local tavern when a crunch

of seafaring fishermen pour out forming an impenetrable knot
around the sidewalk in front of him One of them sees Quint

httpwww script-o-ramaconysnazzydircuthtml

who approaches with no intention of slowing down The seven
fishermen never give it a second thought they part like the
Red Sea clearing a beeline trail to the bar doors Quint
bursts through their obliging ranks and turns into the Music
store The tiny bell jingles daintily Two of the Portu-
guese fishermen spit three times taking no chances

INT AMITY MUSIC STORE - DAY

Quint brushes against the counter The shopkeeper is helping
a ten year old boy fix a new reed to his clarinet The little
boy produces a mellow low tone then wonderingly rides the
scale With little or no effort Quints gnarled hand floats
up and drops like a sledge on the service bell The shop-
keepers eyes pop up the kid hits a bad note and squeaks

QUINT
(forced politeness)
Four spools number twelve piano wire

SHOPKEEPER
Catch any monsters lately Mr Quint

Quints eyes never leave the little boy He is drilling him
with a sidelong whammy The boy feels Quint nailing him and
a ragged assortment of squeaks blurps and missed notes over-
ride the sounds of the shopkeeper unspooling the piano wire

INTERIOR BRODYS STUDY AT HOME - SUNSET

A riffly blur color alternating with black and white The
dizziness stops on a book page showing a black and white
rendering of eight species of shark The banner at the top
of the page reads THE KNOWN AND REPUTED MANEATERS

The riffling begins again stops on a grizzly photograph of
scar tissue on six former shark victims Riffling -- stop

framed by the enormous jaws of a prehistoric shark from the
family Carcharodon charcharias

A jelly-bowl woman visitor to Amitys beaches plunges head-
long into the white foam Theres enough of her stuffed

crunch to speak

MEADOWS

Selectman Denherder almost whispers in Vaughns ear

DENHERDER

VAUGHN

Vaughn opens the door to the Bureau of Records About two
dozen children sit around twisting multi-colored Kleenex

into artificial flowers for the big parade Vaughn turns

his face into a condescending grin

VAUGHN
Could the big people have a grownup

meeting in here please children

CHILD SPOKESMAN

A voice from behind Vaughn draws him away It is a small
but muscular black man named Salvatore

VAUGHN

in this goddam building

SECRETARY

Vaughn starts away and the crowd follows

DENHERDER
Id haul it in myself before Id
pay anything to that maniacyou
wanna hear what he did to three
friends of mine on a Saint Valentines
Day sporting charter

They are halted in their tracks by the grim appearance of
Mrs Kintner and her benign father She is dressed in church
white with a black arm band Mrs Kintner never says a word
She has just tacked something to the community bulletin board
and is walking through the parting crowd With sympathy all
watch her leave then press up to the cork board Brody
fights his way through everyone until we are standing over
his shoulder staring at a homemade poster that offers

ALL OR A FRACTION OF 3000 BOUNTY
TO THE MAN OR MEN WHO CATCH AND
SLAUGHTER THE SHARK THAT SAVAGED
ALEX M KINTNER JR ON SUNDAY
JUNE 29 IN THE TOWN OF AMITY

BRODY

overrules Brody who we pull close to and ---

A naked 100-watt bulb illuminates the electric grinder purring
in one corner The slick black carcass of a pilot whale
dominates the lighted area

SALVATORE

QUINT

SALVATORE
How come harpoon holes in him

Quint doesnt reply as he hacks away The mate rolls away
a full barrel

SALVATORE

angler push a wheelbarrow ahead of them as they near the
tumble-down jetty that leads fifty feet out into the black
water Both men scuff along exhausted

DENHERDER
You wanna call it a night after
here

CHARLIE

Its only two-thirty What are
you tired

DENHERDER
Yeah Charlie I got my second wind
three nibbles back

Denherder hefts a bloodstained laundry bag from the wheel-
barrow revealing about a hundred feet of coiled dog chain
and a large patched inner tube Charlie takes out a monster
hook and together they push the wheelbarrow onto the rickety
pier that is only about five feet across

DENHERDER
(reaching into the bag)
Leg of lamb this time

CHARLIE
Screw lamb -- lets shoot the sirloin

DENHERDER
(a hyena laugh)
Were blowin half the bounty on
bait ---

The splintered pier sways to and fro as the men reach the

end and start to work Charlie baits the hook with a massive
chunk of sirloin while Denherder secures the loose end of
chain to a skinny piling Charlie then fastens the inner tube
to the chain five feet from the end of the hook

DENHERDER
One more after this then Im going
home

CHARLIE
Set

Denherder tugs the chain against the piling to prove that it
is Charlie heaves the bait Splash The inner tube follows
and both men eagerly watch as it floats seaward the chain
playing out from the wheelbarrow

CHARLIE
Tides taking it right out

Charlie lights his pipe and sits back against a piling He

fractured board Denherder paces bored to death

DENHERDER
You do this all the time right
Charlie

CHARLIE
Twenty years

DENHERDER

I cant believe that people pay
money to go fishing This is really
dumb This isnt even relaxing
its just boring

CLOSE - CHAIN IN WHEELBARROW

Suddenly zipping out faster and faster as both men straighten
Denherder is goggle-eyed

DENHERDER
Hey Whats this

The chain is coming out so fast that it begins to drag the
wheelbarrow to the end of the jetty A section of chain
tangles around the handle and flips the entire machine into
the air Both men watch dumbfounded as the inner tube racing
out to sea in a wake of white water suddenly dips under

CHARLIE
Look at him take it

DENHERDER
Do I set the goddam hook

CHARLIE
Let him do it Go-go-go-go-go

It is then that the chain whips taut against the narrow pilings

CLOSE - PILING

resounding CRACK

The end of the jetty is yanked loose Denherder is flipped
like a chip over the side and into the cold night water where

he manages to snag hold of a splintered timber

is being dragged seaward with Charlie sitting dazed on top of

flotilla of wood draw away

CHARLIES POINT OF VIEW

The end of the jetty makes a 180-degree turn and heads back
in his direction

CHARLIE

Denherder steps up on the broken-off piling just to be out of
the water

DENHERDER
Get the hell out Charlie Swim

Charlie inhaling terror trying to slog to shore The jetty
is getting closer Suddenly the chain dragging it through the
water is severed and the charging wood falls behind -- an
enormous black fin breaks water like a periscope making course
corrections as it comes for Charlie

Denherder jumps from piling to piling almost losing his balance
on his way to help Charlie Charlie has reached the last pylon
toward open sea and his hands clamber for a hold But ---

Hooper sees Brody up in arms about something walking toward
him Hooper starts to speak but Brody veers aside and yells
over the pier at the loading boats

BRODY
No dynamite Hand that stuff over

MAN IN BOAT
Its fireworks I read somewhere

it attracts ‘em

HOOPER
Sharks are equipped with two long
cords of nerve tissue that function
as a sort of radar for homing in on
underwater vibrations

(to Brody)

Understand youre having a little
shark trouble

Brody turns and walks away Hooper barely keeping up with him

HOOPER
I know you have a visitor off your
southern shores I think it could
be my shark

BRODY
It belongs to whoever catches it
(to a late arrival)
Youll move this car to a parking
slot mister or it wont be here
when you get back

Brody pauses to look hard at Hooper A careless amateur trips and
falls
into the harbor beyond him

BRODY
I dont have time to help you with
your homework

Brody goes over to lend a hand Hooper persists

HOOPER
Im trying to prove that the shark
that killed Christine Watkins last
Friday was the same rogue that
savaged these

Hooper pushes a mimeographed sheet in front of Brody About
twenty names and addresses in all

BRODY
One shark did all this

HOOPER

(his excitement

multiplying as

he goes on)
The trail of a rogue shark leads
all over the world This is only
a theory It has never been authen-
ticated but there is a wonderful
chance that the shark that killed
the Watkins girl and the man-eater
I tagged off the Great Barrier Reef
are the one and the same Off and on
Ive tracked it to New Zealand
Santiago Bay Cape Town South Africa
uhthe Gulf of Guinea then
West Palm Beach Florida last
December -- and finally predicted
it would follow the warming Gulf
Stream into the Northern Seasonal
Zones and release an attack pattern
along the Jersey Coast I was off
by just three hundred miles It
hit you instead

you get your PhD while my town here
degenerates into some high-class
ghost resort

Brody starts away In the background all boats are heading
toward open ocean

HOOPER
All Im asking is for a little future
cooperation I could predict future
outbursts of attack activity in the
area Use meLet me use you I
scored 93 on my Orals for crying
out loud

BRODY
Weve had two other attacks since
the Watkins thing both fatal
Could you kill it for us

HOOPER
(honest response)
No sir I couldnt

BRODY
Then how do we begin to cooperate

HOOPER
By letting me see Christine Watkins

Twenty yards away in another boat the same struggle ensues
This time its the overloaded boat with the poor scallop fisher-
men Shouts of IM ON DIG IN STRIKE Then a tangle of
tackle springs from the water They have hooked each other

Joy turns to swearing Arnold Felix stands up to applaud the
mishap while his buddy Pratt takes careful aim with his
Remington 1100 12-gauge and blasts at the tackle as if it were
a clay pigeon The tangle explodes ---

matic another blasts point blank with a shotgun There are
occasional water ricochets and the bounty hunters duck from

leans out to grab the moribund shark But Harry wont give
up the line still reeling in

HARRY

PRATT
Hows the family Harry
(to the man with gaff)
Go on and do it

MAN WITH GAFF
We split down the middle

Pratt nods reluctantly The man swings lodges the gaff and
hauls the shark up onto the gunwale A paroxysm of cheers
from the surrounding boats Smoke flares are fired into

the air
HARRY
(a tug-of-war)
Let go my shark
It is a ten-foot blue and what a mess -- splattered with
bullet punctures gashes bleeding from several orifices But
it is not dead -- it kicks back to life and threatens to cap-

size the boat Pratt panics and fires six times with his 45
The bullets pierce the sharks head pass through and split

the fiberglass hull through which a flood of water rises Every-
body stands up as the boat slips beneath them

pokes the eye The Blue shark is wide awake a vicious
lunge in the opposite direction that snaps the gaff in
Pratts hand completely in half

Hooper unravels a lab thermometer on a long nylon cord
twirling it over his head like a lariat finally hurling

it out into the ocean He then unhooks a steel tape measure
from his bag of tricks and spools out feet and inches from
the sharks nose to tail

spits down at the shark takes two paces back and replaces
the veil recovering her poise

VAUGHN
(to Brody)
This it

HOOPER
(interrupting)
I wont know until I perform a
full autopsy

VAUGHN
(sotto to Brody)
Who is this kid

BRODY
Hes a fish expert from the Oceano-
graphic Foundation

VAUGHN

(looking him up and

down in a wholly

irreverent tone)
Well it doesnt take much of an
expert to see that this is the big-
gest ugliest meanest-looking shark
ever hooked around Amity Island

(to the gathering

of men)
Who caught her

Harry steps forward pointing

HARRY
This guy Pratt and me

VAUGHN
A thousand dollars apiece is not a
bad days haul

Vaughn begins shaking hands with the three winners and
Meadows snaps some bonus pictures Mrs Kintners father
draws close to Brody and Vaughn handing Vaughn a card
from his pocket

FATHER
At whatever the cost my daughter
has requested that all preparations
be made to ship this animal to her
home town of Marblehead Mass Can
you accommodate us

VAUGHN
What the devil for

Nary a blink from the old man and Vaughn looks to Hooper
weighing the alternatives

VAUGHN

Well see it through Mr Sands

(to Martin)
Martin you start collecting those
signs And keep your friend away
from that demon with his pigsticker
there Lets show some respect for
the loss weve incurred

(to Meadows walking

him up the beach)
Get the story on the state wire
Try to get AP and UPI to pick it
up in New York or Boston to put it
on the national Call Dave Axelrod
in New York and tell him this is
from me and he owes me one

OFFICER

Where is it How do we find it
It shouldnt come around again
Odds are worse on the highways

BRODY
But you could protect the beach --
I mean you have access to ---

OFFICER
(stopping him)

We could put up a show We could
give you spotters but in where
the waves break the waters
cloudy and its hard to spot

Or we could string out shark

with a dozen alternative thoughts A shattering blast from

107 EXTERIOR - FRONT PORCH OF BRODYS HOUSE - NIGHT

Hooper is having after-dinner with Ellen and Martin
Brody while a spectacular heat-lightning display colors the
night clouds and dances on the water miles out

HOOPER
Therere good things to be said
about meshing Its worked in
Australia for years Repellents
a myth Now theres a cable avail-
able charged with 7000 amps that
could be strung along the entire
bathing area

ELLEN
We have Kahlua Mr Hooper

HOOPER
Matt And I dont drink alcohol
but thank you
(back to Brody)
We think the Great Whites possess
an electrical sense ---

Michael walks in He doesnt smile after the Sunday
incident He is quite dry this evening and is in possession
of a ghastly watercolor of a shark tearing a man in two

MICHAEL
(shy his eyes
on Hooper)
Mrs Pfister had us all draw
sharks in school today

BRODY
I told you not to wear that cracker-
jack ring Its too big -- youre

gonna catch it on something and
lose a finger

HOOPER

httpwww script-o-ramaconysnazzydircuthtml

(always interested)
This is a very good rendering
Mike Looks like a thresher
Whered you learn to draw him

MICHAEL
I -- cheated and found pictures
in one of Dads books

HOOPER
(delighted)
Get bitten by the subjector
just morbid curiosity

BRODY
More in the spirit of the public
interest

MICHAEL

Mrs Pfister says if we have a bad
season we could sell our pictures
to the tourists We get to paint
through American History again
tomorrow

Ellen and Brody exchange worried looks Hooper digs around
in his pocket for something then looks through his satchel
purse

ELLEN
You want me to speak to her tomorrow

Hooper hands Michael a sharks tooth on a wire necklace
HOOPER

I picked this up in Macao Theres
supposed to be a superstition about

these things -- that if you keep it
with you youll be safe from shark
bite

Michael smiles for the first time and a warm moment passes
between him and Hooper

MICHAEL
I gotta show this to Guber

BRODY
Dont sleep with that on son
Youll cut something in the night

ELLEN
(squeezing his hand
across the table)
That was nice Michael hasnt
smiled since his birthday party

(changing subject
referring to storm)
Yeah Listen Im no crack meteor-
ologist but I think were in store
for some surf

HOOPER
Hope not Im longlining in the
morning You should come along
Martin

BRODY
In case you havent caught the
island gossip I never take baths
-- just showers

HOOPER
Aquaphobia or what Mind if I
smoke

BRODY

No Here wait

Brody takes out a lighter as Hooper puts a twisted cigarette
in his mouth Instead of inhaling Hooper takes a long hit
and it doesnt take long for the shock to beat the aroma to
where Ellen and Martin sit

HOOPER
(behind the hit)
Im going to try and snag the old
boy with 332 of an inch stainless
steel aircraft cable

BRODY
(dubiously amused)
I could throw your ass in jail for
that

HOOPER
Brought my own cage thanks If
this really is my shark hes got
a Peterson disc tag on his anal
fin It cant be seen from a boat

BRODY
(growing anger at
this young mans
impudence)
Once hooked what then

httpwwwscript-o-ramacomsnazzydircuthtml (46 of 110)6152009 102946 PM
httpwww script-o-ramaconysnazzydircuthtml

Hooper brightens and reaches into his duffel pulling out
a shiny stainless steel object about the size of an alarm

clock

HOOPER
Biotelemetry Its a radio collar
I bell the cat and then follow him
anywhere Im trying to make a
deal with a satellite tracking
station at Houston Texas

BRODY
(getting riled)
Now lets wait a minute You have
him hooked right

HOOPER
(trying to be jovial)
Well Ill never take him without
a fight but --

BRODY
And you stick that -- cigarette
case to his neck

HOOPER
(wondering where
this is leading)
Thats the game plan

BRODY
Then you let it loose You let
it go free

Hooper sees where this has arrived He swallows the
and takes a breath

HOOPER
I know what youre saying Martin

BRODY
Your little lab experiment has
seen three innocent people killed
over the past three days

ELLEN
Martin its not his shark

BRODY
And your list makes me sick You
carry it around with you like
youre keeping score

Oh Christ Whose side are you on
You told me youd help us get rid
of it

HOOPER
What I said was Id help predict
future attacks in your area If
this device works the early warn-
ing to other shorefront resorts --
not just here but anywhere it
ranges in the world ---

BRODY
I dont give a crap about your
worldwide conquest What about
right here This town is going
under today Wheres your humanity
You could kill this thing for us
flatten its ass and ---

HOOPER
(rising)
Im staying at the Abilard Arms

Hooper gathers his things climbs into his backpack
Smiles at Ellen and kisses her hand Ellen smiles not

yet recovered from embarrassment

HOOPER
I really liked dinner

He leaves Ellen looks at her hand Brody turns and sees

her
ELLEN
(its all she
can say)
Nobody kisses hands anymore
BRODY
If you stick that wet spot under
the black light at the Coney
Island Aquarium theyll let you
in for nothing
108 EXTERIOR - ABOARD HOOPERS BOAT - FOGGY DAY

The boat is slicing gentle swells into the flat water
Hooper is mainlining from a big reel Tuna-halibut clips
attached to each of the lines that bear hooks and floats
every ten yards Large bait chunks are tossed into the
water In the boat with him is Meadows huddled ina
corner and trying to appear eager to learn Hooper is

not cooperating He storms around upset and frustrated

MEADOWS
Okay Whats the second species
of shark on your dangerous list

Hooper opens the throttle half-speed looking into the sonar
display that casts a green glow in the soupy weather A
blip appears on the screen that draws a speculative hum from
Hooper

MEADOWS
(trying to
sound scientific)
Fish activity

HOOPER
Very deep -- looks like a school
(more to himself)
Mackerel Really clumped together

As the two huddle together in the green spill Hooper touches
the throttle to increase speed still slightly puzzled

HOOPER
Staying right with us

109 INSERT - SONAR ACTIVITY

MEADOWS (0S)
And didnt you say activity stops
If any of those whoppers are

around
HOOPER
Tends to Gets very still down
there
110 CLOSE - MEADOWS

looks up from the scope and his expression turns to horror

MEADOWS
Look out

Hooper looks up in time to avert a near collision with Ben
Gardners boat the Flicka

It is completely awash with water in the cockpit right up
to the gunwales Seat cushions and hatch covers float about
banging and thumping The boat is wallowing and it seems

that given a touch more weight it will sink

MEADOWS

httpwwwscript-o-ramacomsnazzydircuthtml (49 of 110)6152009 102947 PM
httpwww script-o-ramaconysnazzydircuthtml

(shocked)
Thats Ben Gardners boat Ben
Ben

Hooper comes up alongside cuts his engine and goes forward
to tie his bowline to a forward cleat on the Flicka

INSERT - SONAR SCOPE

Bigger blips both visually and audibly

Taking note of this Hooper stands a moment trying to figure
out what could have done this There doesnt seem to be any
damage fore or aft Then he notices that one of the after
cleats on the Flicka has been torn awaythere are scars

on the wood where the screws are used to hold the cleats down

MEADOWS
(skin crawling from
the foggy stillness)
He must have hit somethingIm
sure they had life-belts on board

Hooper nods toward the water

ANGLE - WATER

We see life-belts and jackets floating in the unearthly
stillness

HOOPER - WIDE

He gingerly steps onto the rail of Flicka peeks into the
cockpit and cabin Awash No sign of life He puts more
weight down as he cranes his neck further and the whole
boat lists to one side Hooper leaps back to his own

ANOTHER ANGLE - HOOPERS BOAT

He opens a locker and pulls out a wet suit and other gear

MEADOWS
Maybe we should just tow it in

Id better see the damage first

116 CLOSE - MEADOWS

suddenly cold zips up his windbreaker and turns the collar
up as Hooper zips up his wetsuit and clasps on a weighted
belt

HOOPER
Did he have a dinghy on board

MEADOWS
(just wants
out of here)
I dont know

Hooper hyper-ventilates as he places on mask checks his
hot flashlight

MEADOWS
(alone)
Id rather we just towed it in
Mr Hooper

Hooper finishes hyper-ventilatingsmiles to reassure him

HOOPER
Be up in a minute

Hes ready to go but hesitates a moment staring out at the
sea -- the first time Hooper has appeared to be doubting his
next move He shakes it off takes a huge breath lets out
half and splashes in

117 ANGLE - MEADOWS

all alone in the boat Just he and the active sonar He
checks the second-hand sweep of his watch counting out loud

118 UNDERWATER SEQUENCE - HOOPER

Hooper descends in a froth of bubbles Warily he turns a
full circle with his hotlight At first we see nothing out
of place about the Flicka except that it is lying so low

in the water But as Hooper travels the bottom looking for
damage he comes across a jagged hole two-thirds of the way
forward The hole is about the size of a basketball and
the wood around it has been bashed and splintered Hooper
explores the hole with his hands then takes the knife from
its sheath and begins to dig at something Whatever it is
comes free in his hand As he studies his find his light
wanders upward pointing directly into the dark hole Hooper
looks up

CLOSE - HOLE

Ben Gardners dead face stares out through the hole in the
Flicka eyes and mouth gaping in frozen horror his skin
pinched like a prune

CLOSE - HOOPER

bumps his head in trying to get away seems to yell through
escaping bubbles His mask fills with water as he flails
for the surface Miscalculating he bumps into the hull of
his own boat scrambles around it finally coming up between
the two boatsgulping air unable to speak yet shocked
and scared out of breath

MEADOWS
Bad --

All Hooper can do is hold out his hand open for Meadows to
see A shiny white tooth at least two inches long rests
in the palm of his hand

HOOPER
A White -- its a Great White I
knew it Looks like he died

of fright in there

MEADOWS
(scared shitless)
No shark did that to a boat ---

Hooper rolls up his sleeve and with one stroke of the tooth
shaves all the hair off him forearm

HOOPER
One this big could do anything

Meadows will never be the same

fish that swallowed Jonah was not
a whale but a great white shark

VAUGHN
Love to prove that wouldnt you
Get into the National Geographic

BRODY
What should we do about this white

Hooper has come prepared He takes from his backpack a
Bomar Brain calculator and ticks away at it while talking

HOOPER

The longer theres nothing to
munch on here the better your
chances hell go That means of
course keeping your beaches
closed your fishermen in port
The other alternative is non-
corrosive 100-gauge steel mesh --
say 30000 feet of it around your
bathing area Concrete blocks and
installation would run youoh
four five hundred thousand That
is unless you could seek a deputa-
tion from the federal government --

(notes Vaughns non-

believing countenance)
Beats getting swallowed doesnt it

Vaughn is apoplectic His seemingly dead cigar glows again
He takes Brody by the arm and leads him out of earshot of
Hooper

BRODY
Maybe we can make it up in August

VAUGHN
That beach will be open ON the FOURTH

BRODY
We have to give this a coupla weeks

VAUGHN

enough I1ll have to think of
some reason thatll keep the
grease from frying In the mean-

splashing in the golden surf with flailing arms has been
significantly reinterpreted Some pranksters have painted

a huge dorsal fin cutting through the waves next to her and
she now looks like an hysterical beach-goer stampeding out

of the water The deputies begin covering it over with paint
People have been gathering throughout the scene on bicycles

Hooper is loading some mainline floats and smelly bait fish
on board Two young long-hairs are assisting him The old
harbormaster dips his coffee percolator into the water and

rinses it thoroughly while watching Hooper load He rises

to his feet and walks across the pier looking in the oppo-
site direction about three slips away

nets are positioned to disguise the mission

INT QUINTS RESIDENCE - NIGHT

Entering Quints abode is not unlike a spooky ride at
Disneylandthe placement of objects the dungeon lighting
the tendrils of smoke and dust in the air makes a visitor
wish he were carrying a 100-watt bulb

There is gear everywhere The walls are adorned with jerky
shark hides coiled ropes dangle like serpents above a galley
stove that leaks smoke and holds two weeks worth of filthy
dishes Tubes barrels rods reels harpoons an antique
gun collection and a dizzy array of shark hooks line the
walls with one entire wall dedicated to a collection of
laminated jaws from the blue shark to the Great White Con-
spicuously in the center of the room is a swivel fighting
chair and it looks like the perfect place to have all your
teeth pulled Into this orifice of decay Brody enters

and from his point of view we see Quint hunched over a tub
of steaming Borax

BRODY
I know its late Mr Quint

Quint lifts a ghastly set of dripping jaws from the solution

Quint walks toward Brody with Borax dripping from both hands
He places one of them hospitably on Brodys shoulder

QUINT
(without losing
a beat)
Sure you would sweetheart

And ushers him into the fighting chair He then busies him-
self around the premises and Brody must use the swivel chair
to follow him feeling chills whenever Quint move behind him

BRODY
How can you be sure

HOOPER

The sea is full of fish again for

Bachs Little Fugue is the musical accompaniment to this
wholly visual montage of disembarkation The next two minutes

Station wagons with pale winter faces pressed anxiously to
the windows Cadillacs with Rear Admirals at the helm their
wives with blue hair remembering the way from the years before

Then six blonde and tanned Coney Island meatballs descend the

ramp They all wear Mens Club Lifeguard patches and matching
collegiate windbreakers They scour the landing looking for

someone to save

The boat is empty Everybody heading inland anticipating the
best Fourth of July ever Already there is debris on the
docks and the cleaning crew works away at it

INSIDE THE FERRY

As Bachs Little Fugue ends the six burly crewmen lean their
combined weight against the Cathedral doors closing out the

light and locking in the trade The doors latch shut with a

resounding clang

They are not yet aware The fin seems to circle and return
It heads toward Michaels boat when another small dinghy gets
in its way -- a weekend novice just finishing a thermos of
coffee when he is bumped The entire boat is overturned
Michael sees the fin now as it collides with him the entire bow
lifting out of the water and rolling over on the port side
Michael and Kit are thrown head first

Three heads in the water come up sputtering the fin between
them crossing back Michael freezes The fin comes directly
at him growing into the sky passing him so close he could
touch it but ignoring him as it follows the flailing and
panicked weekend novice Catches him Michael watches

Hooper snaps the rope onto the leader and holds on

QUINT
Watch your hands --
(suddenly to Brody)
Grab onto this

Before he realizes whats happening Brody is clumsily clutch-
ing at the big rod appalled Quint skips away for a harpoon
He picks one from a row of twelve turns

Thats when the leader lashes free sending Hooper crashing
backward in a serious fall and the rod whips at Brodys
forehead drawing blood Quint snatches up the rod and
reels in The wires have been bitten through

QUINT
(addressing the ocean)
Sureyoure havin a ball

Brody begins to apply cream to his sunburned nose

Stop HereCut the engine

Hooper cuts the engines as Quint swings nimbly down He stands
stock still on the main deck motioning Brody to be silent
Then picking up the newly rigged rod Quint softshoes it over
to the chair About to sit down he freezes

Quint snorts and dumps the chum overboard Flings in the
two mackerel

BRODY
Whered it go

Hooper is rummaging in his gear Brody watches him locate a
small waterproof signal light He starts to attach it to

the first barrel Quint who has been scanning the sea spins
around

QUINT
Dont monkey with none of my gear

HOOPER

(trying to be patient)
Your harpoons are attached to
these right

(indicates barrels)
They pop up and drag on him drag
on him till hes through -- isnt
that the idea

QUINT
You cant improve on it

Hooper switches on the signal light It pulses a glow that
hurts the eyes even in broad daylight

HOOPER
What if we have to follow him

Quint breathes in smoke until his tongue catches fire

QUINT
Sonny -- take that and your
formulas and your cage -- take
your whole halfass hardware store

A whale of a thump jolts the Orca Quint grabs for a harpoon
Brody pulls his snub-nose special from his shopping bag
Hooper sees the panic on Brodys face and reaches a hand out

to him

HOOPER

The Great White slaps the transom with its tail and sounds

INSERT - COILED ROPE AND BARREL

The rope reels out in a blur and Hooper pins Brody out of
the way of the spinning coils -- just in time The barrel
with flasher attached literally somersaults out of the boat
missing both mens faces by seven inches

Quint is already poised feet planted with harpoon number
two

ANGLE - OCEAN

The barrel skips like a flat rock over the surface of the
water then unexpectedly vanishes under the water

QUINT

air Quint starts to doze massaging his missing tattoo

The Orca sits on unruffled waters A planetarium of star-
life overhead with shooting stars every now and again
making incisions into the heavens and leaving green trails
behind All is quiet not a breath of wind

The barrels strobe light pops into foreground CLOSE It
heads toward the Orca carving neon blue phosphorescence

night and circles the Orca leaving phosphorescence in its
broad wake The night skies the silent waters are now

EXT THE ORCA —- DAWN

Brody leans against the windshield on the flybridge His

arms hoist binoculars to his eyes Visible without binoculars
is the signal-light and barrel not moving two hundred yards
astern An angry racket filters up from below deck -- Quint
is effecting engine repairs the only way he knows how Brody
has learned a neat sailors trick and nimbly slides down the
hand piping his feet avoiding the steps He sidles next to
Hooper who is struggling into his full wet suit

QUINT (os)

BRODY
(loud and off)
No -- still there

Hooper is busy attaching the cage to the ginpole He is full
of purpose his hands working against the clock short glances
to the hatch from where Quint can be heard cursing and wrench-
ing

BRODY
Please Matt dont get him sore
Hes loony enough

Hooper tests the rope inspects his gear selects a steel
pole and opens a tiny green felt case

BRODY
Put all that stuff away before he
finds out

INSERT - GREEN FELT CASE

Hooper opens it removing a deadly-looking syringe head

HOOPER

Quint finesses the Orca slow ahead toward the barrel The
engine sounds like a hamster treadmill Hooper climbs up
beside him

HOOPER

Quint follows after him putting a cautioning hand on Hoopers
shoulder to walk softly then motions Brody to stay on the
flybridge and keep his eyes peeled

Tiptoe to the stern Quint intercepting a harpoon along the
way Hooper leans way out over the transom and poles the
barrel closer It bobs around easily arousing Quints sus-

Playin possum

Hooper poles up the slick nylon rope leaving the barrel
untouched in the water

QUINT
Pull up easy -- only want to goose
him up Second you feel hes run-
ning drop itIf you want any
hands left

Hooper starts hand-reeling in Surprisingly there is no
resistance Both men share perplexed looks Then Quint
reaches over his whole body leaning over the side putting
down his harpoon

QUINT
Here -- gimme I dont get what

201 WATER - ANGLE

Both men are draped over the side their chins almost touching
the water on the aft side From the opposite starboard
direction fully unfastened from the barrel comes the Great
White First the fin then the conical nose and the upper
border of wide grinning teeth It knifes through the water
in absolute silence propelling itself with tremendous speed
toward the unsuspecting men

direction

203 CLOSE - HOOPER AND QUINT

They turn just in time and a long spine-stretch saves them
from instant decapitation The Great White passes the
transom the harpoon still in its side and trailing five feet
of chewed off cable The monster rolls on its side and looks
at them as it passes Then with a great sweep of its tail
it lashes the side of the boat ripping the rope from Quints
hand and shearing off five square yards of paint like a lathe
It makes a wide arc out to sea only the fin showing now and
begins to circle around the boat Quint notices his hand
palm cut and bleeding realizes he came that close to losing
his whole hand He has never been more dangerous

QUINT
(to Brody)
Haul in that rope -- it can foul
us
(screaming

to Hooper)
Start the engine --

Brody and Hooper exchange places The engine starts with a
terrible grinding

QUINT
(roaring)
Easy Itll tear right out

BRODY
(next to him
hauling in rope)
We cant do it ourselves

QUINT

Shut up
BRODY
He chewed through this he cracked

The shark is closing the gap faster

QUINT

Hard to port

Hooper pulls the boat into a tight turn and Quint has a shot
at the upward rolling flank He sinks it with careful pre-
cision

QUINT
Try shakin that out

Brody emerges from the cabin as the rope zips overboard and
the barrel changing over catapults into the air before
plunging into the ocean in a cloudy splash

BRODY
(shouting to Hooper)
This wont kill it
QUINT

Swing around After him

212 ON THE FLYBRIDGE

Hooper can see the fin racing ahead of the barrel Diving

QUINT
Watch it

Hooper skillfully avoids the speeding rope

QUINT
Atta boy

Quint leans to one side harpoon over his head The
Great White breaks water and

QUINT
Take two theyre small

He sinks it deep We hear shots As the new rope whips out
Brody can be seen standing on the gunwale clutching the
steel cage with one hand firing his pistol at the shark
with the other

Quint shakes his head in amused disbelief at this as the
barrel goes over

HOOPER
(shouting at Brody)
Dont shoot him any more Hes
crazy on his own blood already

BRODY
I cant stand here doing nothing

QUINT

dear life as the shark changes course

QUINT
Pull in the ropes and tie ‘em onto

Brody and Hooper pull in with all they are worth as Quint

QUINT
Get tired Thats the idea

Haul in -- watch the prop

At that Quint slides down to the prow grabs up an iron

It is too light He grabs another finding satisfaction in
its heft and balance The shark can be seen directly ahead
threshing closer

QUINT
em Quick -- Now

Now Untie

He sinks the iron and the shark veers downward in a gushing
shower of spray

HOOPER AND BRODY

They are trying to untie from the cleats but both ropes are
stretched too taut They jump out of the way as the ropes
stretch down the side and behind the boat knocking over
objects as it skeeters across the deck A tight jerking
motion and the Orca is dragged through the water -- backwards
And much too fast Water is splashing up over the transom

in its backward wake

QUINT
I said untie them ---

Wrenched to one side Quint is knocked from his feet

CLOSE - THE TWO CLEATS

A moment of slackness and then a great surge of raw strength

The rope snaps the cleats off screws and splintered wood
spraying -- and the barrels fly into the water They dis-
appear beneath the turbulent grey surface

The three men breathing heavily bruised and pouring sweat
look out at the blank water

ANGLE - OCEAN

Pop -- pop -- pop One two three the barrels surface --

BRODY

Dead astern JZig-zag

There is something different about Quint Hes quieter now

He gooses the throttle but the engine only screeches and
pounds erratically The three barrels pass beyond the boat

negotiating a tight circle and plowing mercilessly toward
the Orca The tip of the fin aims for the stern Quint
is ready with his rifle

The shark breaks water and rises like a rocket snout jaw
and pectoral fins shooting straight up We see the smoke-
white belly the pelvic fin as it clears the surface and

falls sideways drenching Quint who fires six times

The Orca shudders from side to side From Hoopers point of
view we can just discern what is happening The shark has
the lower transom in its jaws and is shaking the boat with
each jolt of its head Quint shoots until spent Brody
seizes a gaff and drives it down at the conical nose again
and again

QUINT
Throttle back --

When they next peer out the dorsal fin can be seen gliding
away beginning a long circle around the Orca

Right about now the Orcas engine breathes its final fumes
and fails

CLOSE - BRODY AND QUINT

Utter dismay Hooper turns the key the motor wheezesbut
the engine is dead

ANGLE - QUINT

His eyes flick from Hooper to the transom It is cracked
Then out at the barrelsthey dont seem to be moving

BRODY
(noting this)
Maybe we killed it

QUINT
(dont I wish)
We didnt kill it

In rebuttal the barrels begin to move again closer in
tighter concentric circles

CUT TO

ON DECK —- HOOPER

slipping into his weight-belt strapping on his compressed
air tanks Nobody wants to stop him this timeeven Quint
helps him on with things

HOOPER
Your pumps are out too Drop me
down to twenty feet or so okay

Hooper walks over to the cage Opens the steel doors and
closes himself in

HOOPER
(to Quint)
Try and keep him off me till Im
down

Quint nods grimly and Hooper brandishes the pole with affixed
syringe He give him a thumbs up and Hooper absently returns
it Quint circles the deck eye on the barrels

228 HOOPER AND BRODY

on opposite sides of the bars

HOOPER
(with a reassuring
smile)
Lower away Chief

He pops his mouthpiece between teeth and lowers the face
mask Unsure Brody manages to undo the knot that starts the
cage into the ocean He and Hooper stare at one another as
their faces pass Hoopers moving down down into the slate-
grey sea Brody curls the rope around his forearm for a
stronger hold

QUINT
Thats the way Chief

BRODY
Live and learn

229 UNDERWATER —- CAGE

HOOPERS POINT OF VIEW
Submerging The sky horizon water line clean fresh sea
air thenthe magnificent innerspace with bubbles sparkling

in front of us

230 ANGLE - HOOPER IN THE CAGE

as he floats to twenty feet Hooper never stops looking around
360 degrees He removes the rubber guard from the needle and
waits

EXT THE SURFACE - BRODY AND QUINT

Their turning heads tell us that the barrels are still
circling Suddenly both heads stop turning

THE SEA

The barrels have come to a stop Delicately they change
course and meander toward the lowered cage

UNDERWATER - HOOPER

His back is to us He is just now completing a visual sweep
and turns eyes front into closeup and fixes wildly on
something monstrousand fascinating

HOOPERS POINT OF VIEW

The water is clear and shafts of sunlight streak downward

in the blue From the deep gloom -- diving slowly smoothly
-- comes the shark It move with no apparent effort sinuous
beyond comparison As it nears the cage it turns and its
ghastly length passes right in front of him first the snout
then the jaw slack and smiling then the black eye

Hooper tentatively reaches out It is too far for the
strychnine pole The vinyl flesh is pocked with bullet holes
iron scars gaffing hooks and strange open wounds that tinge
the passing currents with pink

SURFACE

The trailing barrels GONG and SCRATCH the keel of the Orca
above Brody and Quint leap back

HOOPER - CLOSE

The shark has vanished into a cloud of rising silt Hooper
expecting the shark to attack out of that same general
direction braces himself pole extended through the bars
breathing faster straining his eyes into the gloom andwe
see that the shark attacking from behind him

The cage is sent careening Hooper grabs the bars for dear
life The shark has grabbed the steel struts in its brutal
jaws shaking the cage relentlessly from side to side bending
the bars like clothes hangers Hooper cant turn the point-
end of the pole around his body jammed as far away from the
non-rational attacker as possible

Hooper is trapped

The shark withdraws to get some running room then charges again
The bleeding snout thrust deeper into the yawing bars the

jaws snapping and twisting two feet from Hoopers torso the
tail thrusting it forward Hooper drops the strychnine pole
between the bars and it tumbles slowly toward rapture depth

All the shark needs is one more good thrust before separating
Hooper at the waistline Through frantic bubbles Hooper
fumbles with the overhead hatch cover kicking up and out

of the cage The shark backpedals with its tail but the
broad head wont shake loose

Hooper rushes downwards after the strychnine pole

ANGLE - SHARK

As spirals of harmless bullets bead the water the shark twists
free of the cage and arrows downward after Hooper

Hooper nearly recovers the pole Again it slips from his
frightened grasp and this time disappears into a narrow
abyss Hooper turns and looks up

The Great White is lunging at him twenty feet above

SURFACE

One of the barrel ropes snakes around the cage rope and pulls
taut

HOOPER - DEEP

Turning to meet the monster which -- though held back for a
moment by the snarled rope -- now surges forward

SURFACE - BRODY AND QUINT

The Orca is listing dangerously aft the ginpole bent almost
to the breaking point Brody is in a frenzy trying to haul
up the cage Quint attaches the end of Brodys rope to a
hand-winch The GINPOLE IS SPLITTING

QUINT
Let go of it

The pole gives way the rope whipping down on the gunwale
the pulling of the tonnage below is tipping the Orca dragging
it but Quint wont give up the winch Brody hauls on the
rope barehanded

UNDERWATER - HOOPER

maneuvering downward away from the jawsSuddenly the crazed
shark veers upward for the surface

SURFACE - QUINT

The winch is working faster now Quint demonically winding
it in The crushed cage bangs against the hull then breaks
water

Brody is horrified THE CAGE IS EMPTY

QUINT
(a horrible scream)
Hes comin up ---

MASTER ANGLE

The shark breaks water right beside the Orca rising with a
great whooshing noise It rises vertically towering over-
head blocking out the sun The pectoral fins seem to reach
forward The shark in all of its monstrous glory falls onto
the stern of the boat with a shattering crash narrowly
missing Quint and Brody It drives the stern underwater

the ocean pours in over the transom The jaws snap from side
to side Brody flounders backwards away from it Quint
gropes for his rifle and fires The shark heaves its terrible
girth and Quint flies backwards onto his harpoon display

CLOSE - QUINT

Skewered by a Number Twelve iron Quint gulps blood and
pitches into the onrushing sea

NIGHTMARE ANGLE - BRODY

The Orca is tipping backwards sinking stern first tipping
Brody toward the gaping thrusting jaws Deck chairs irons
spent cartridges thermos beer cans all pour into the
vacuum of the open gagging jaws It wants Brody now its
tail keeping him into position

Brody is sliding toward it with the rest of the debris as

the bow raises thirty degrees He intercepts one of Hoopers
compressed air tanks and just as he and everything else pours
toward the whirlpool and into the jaws Brody braces himself

and shoves the tanks at the bottomless pit They jam between
the upper and lower jaws and stick fast

The shark twists backward in the water and turns away Hooper

httpwww script-o-ramacomsnazzydircuthtml
rising is peering around for Brody and Quint The shark is
spinning in crazed circles the head-thrusts indicating that
it can neither dislodge nor swallow the silver tanks It
bites down at fifteen tons pressure per square inch The
TANKS EXPLODE

247 SURFACE - EXPLOSION

A thirty-foot geyser of bright red water touches the black
sky spreading everywhere missing nothing

248 UNDERWATER

Clouds of blood -- sharks suspended carcass Another cloud
-- Quint suspended

249 SURFACE - THE ORCA

sinks with a rumble

250 CLOSE - HOOPER ON SURFACE

Raising his mask from the water he kicks toward Brody

251 UNDERWATER

The steel-grey body of the shark is falling away an apparition
evanescing into the darkness -- sinking in a slow graceful

spiral stopped by the bobbing barrels

252 SURFACE - BRODY AND HOOPER

Brody is holding onto a cushion barely afloat in shock

BRODY
QuintQuintis he dead

Hooper crosses Brodys chest with his left arm keeping him
up in the water

HOOPER
Dont talk Weve got a long way

253 HIGH SHOT

The two tiny miserable heroes swimming from the debris

FADE OUT
