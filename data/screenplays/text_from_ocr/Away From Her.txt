EXT RUNDOWN NEIGHBOURHOOD - FEBRUARY 2005 1

Grant a handsome man in his 70’s with a constant twinkle in
his eye drives down a suburban looking street in a poor area
of a small Ontario town He consults an address that lies on
the seat beside him Looks at the houses as he passes them
Mostly rental houses Some of the yards are markedby car
tracks the windows plastered with tinfoil or hung with faded
flags He finds the address he’s looking for Asmall house
on a quiet street He pulls into the driveway This house is
much better looked after though still modest There are
flowers freshly planted He takes a moment Stares at the
house Takes a deep breath

EXT PIER- 1961 - SUMMER - DAY 2

GRANT’S MEMORY of a beautiful 18 year oldgirl She is
leaning against the rail of a pier overlooking a great lake
It is windy and cold and raining lightly The wind blows her
pale blonde hair into her face She is confident and strong
She is smiling staring straight at us Sheis yelling over
the wind a glimmer in her eye We can’t hear what she’s
saying We hear the voice of a man in his 70s

GRANT (VO)
She said “Do you think it would be
fun - Do you think it would be fun
if we got married”

A younger woman’s voice is heard

KRISTY (VO)
What did you say

GRANT (VO)
I took her up on it I shouted yes

The 18 year old girl grins She turns away and looks out at
the water happy

GRANT (VO)
I never wanted to be away from her
She had the spark of life

She looks back at us Right into our eyes

The image dissolves to white ski tracks melt overher face

“Harvest Moon” by Neil Young plays on the soundtrack

A bird’s eye view of a snowy ice covered lake Acouple skis

direction To where they came from

Over our many winters her hair
went from pale blonde to silver
That’s all I don’t think I noticed
exactly when

We pause here and then we continue on around their property
We find FIONA AND GRANT ANDERSSON skiing together through
their field Grant is in his 70s Fiona in her sixties They
are both stunning and sexy with humour intheir eyes We
recognize Fiona as the beautiful girl we sawat the
beginning She is ethereal light and sly As though always
enjoying a private joke They pant hard asthey ski side by
side glancing at each other

INT ANDERSSON’S KITCHEN -JANUARY 2003- EVENING 4

The cottage is warm and comfortable Rugs crooked on the
floor and cup rings bitten into the table varnish FIONA and
GRANT are both tastefully dressed They prepare dinner
together There’s a sense of easy routine about it Grant
chops vegetables while Fiona tends the stove There’s not a
lot of conversation about what they’re doing As hemaneuvers
around her to dump the vegetables into thepan his arms
encircle her waist and he steals the spatula from where she
has left it on the counter

FIONA
Careful

He hides the spatula behind his back She turns to look at
him knowing what he’s done
FIONA
Give me that

He stays still She scuffs his hair on the way out the door

FIONA
Alright then You do it

He smiles Continues her work at the stove We hear the
television come on A news segment about anelection

INT ANDERSSON’S LIVINGROOM -JANUARY 2003- EVENING 5

They eat a good looking dinner Not labour intensive but
carefully made

FIONA
Then they showed this totally
irrelevant clip of him running
Apparently he likes to run when
he’s canvassing

GRANT
It must have had some context

She takes a sip of wine He laughs

FIONA
It didn’t And he runs like a
goalie

GRANT

Oh and you’re such a hockey fan
Show me how a goalie runs

FIONA acts out a goalie running laughing her headoff She
sits back down

FIONA
Oh It’s too sad He wants to be a
good samaritan in the most boring
possible way

Grant laughs A pause and then they both start giggling
again She looks at his clothes

FIONA
Don’t you have another shirt
INT ANDERSSON’S KITCHEN - JANUARY 2003 -NIGHT 6

FIONA and GRANT clean the kitchen together A warmquiet
between them Grant steals tender glances at her ashe does
the dishes and she dries them It’s as though he is watching
for something She goes about putting the dishes away
oblivious to his eyes on her This goes on for a while We
watch them work in silence she puts the dishes in the
cupboards He hands her a frying pan She stares at it for a
moment She opens the freezer and puts it inside As he hears
the freezer door open he turns to look at her She looks
back at himoblivious She goes back to putting thedishes

He waits until she is safely in the other room and then
sadly takes the pan out of the freezer and puts it ina
cupboard

INT ANDERSSON’S LIVINGROOM -JANUARY 2003 -NIGHT 7

FIONA lies with her head on GRANT’S lap There’s a fire in
the fireplace the house orderly and cosy It’s snowing
outside big fairy tale snow flakes He reads toher from a
book of poetry

GRANT
(reading)
You climbed the bank and said
This is how you touch other women
The grass cutter’s wife the lime
burner’s daughter
And you searched your arms
For the missing perfume
And knew

Fiona strokes his face Interrupts him
FIONA
Don’t worry darlingI expect I’m

just losing my mind

GRANT
Ssshhhh

He grabs her hand Kisses it

GRANT
What good is it to be the lime
burner’s daughter
Left with no trace
As if not spoken to in the act of
love
As if wounded without the pleasure
of a scar
You touched your
Belly to my hands
In the dry air and said
I am the cinnamon

Peeler’s wife Smell me

She falls asleep as he reads He watches her sleep for a few
moments

close kissing her neck

GRANT

He thinks for a moment

GRANT
Nothing

He looks at the back of her head guilty and wondering He
leans over and kisses her forehead She smiles Heturns away
and closes his eyes

EXT MARIANS HOUSE -FEBRUARY 2005- MORNING 11

Grant sits in his car in the same shot as the opening He
gets out of the car and knocks on the door of the house in
the rundown neighbourhood Marian an attractive woman inher
60s opens the door She holds some flowers in her hand as
though she was just about to put them in a vase She speaks
with a fairly heavy American accent

MARIAN
Yes

GRANT
I don’t quite know how to introduce
myself I used to see your husband
at Meadowlake I’m a regular
visitor there myself Those are
some lovely flowers

We will keep returning to this scene throughout the film
always picking up right where we left off

INT ANDERSSON’S LIVINGROOM- JUNE 2003- AFTERNOON 12

Fiona arranges wild flowers while Grant makes drinks Warm
spring light pours through the house

GRANT
I’ve never seen those white ones
before

FIONA
The earth must really suit them
there

Grant goes to the kitchen and notices something as he goes to
get a spoon to stir the drinks On each of the kitchen
drawers there are post it notes saying”cutlery dishtowels
knives” He looks at them debating whether or notto say
something He laughs

Fiona is busily arranging the flowers

GRANT
You could always just open the

drawers Remind yourself

FIONA
What

He comes into the livingroom and stands inthe doorway to the
kitchen

GRANT
Maybe all the labels All the
lists are defeating the purpose
(MORE )
GRANT (contd)
If you stop thinking about things
the moment you write them down
maybe that’s the end of your need
to recall

Fiona seems unperturbed by this question Doesnt turn
around

FIONA
If only we recalled just what we
needed

She lets this hang in the air a moment Then continues
lightly

FIONA
There was a story I heard at a
dinner party about the German
soldiers on border patrol in
Czechoslovakia during the war
Remember that Czech student you
had Veronica We spoke once at a
dinner party

Grant is absolutely still She tosses this casually

Don’t get nervous It’s a good

And now she looks at him with a smile
FIONA
She told me that each of the German
patrol dogs wore a sign that said

Hund Why said the Czechs and the
Germans said Because that is a

She gives him an amicable smile Not threatening in any way
He watches her his breath is caught in his throat She
leaves the room and he lets his breath out Stares at the

The doorbell rings Fiona answers the door Phoebe and
William Hart a couple in their 60’s standat the door Fiona
throws her arms around Phoebe

PHOEBE
Where the hell have you two been

WILLIAM
Phoebe’s a nightmare to live with
when she hasn’t played bridge ina
while Call more often will you
INT LIVINGROOM - NIGHT 15

They have drinks in the livingroom

FIONA
Well at least we’re all waiting
together

WILLIAM

You wouldn’t say that if you were
waiting for a transplant

PHOEBE
(to William)
Who have you become all of a
sudden Jesus you sound like one
of those “Stand up For Canada”
conservative commercials

FIONA
(winks at William)
Well he’s not as young as he used
to be Phoebe

Grant is poking the fire His hands covered in soot
WILLIAM
I just don’t think you can ignore

how serious a problem these waiting

lists are

FIONA
I think they are a problem I just
don’t think the solution is a
shorter line for those who can
afford it and longer lines for
those who can’t Oh look now
youve made me all earnest and

boring

Grant looks down at his sooty fingers He gets up and as he

passes Fiona he touches her face leaving a bigsooty

fingerprint on her cheek She looks up at him knowingly She

knows there’s a mark on her cheek and tries hard not to

smile He tries not to smile too It doesn’t really work He

sits down

FIONA
You’re an idiot Do you know that

GRANT
It worked for you

FIONA
It’s a wonder I ever brought him
home to the parents

16 INT LIVINGROOM- JUNE 2003- NIGHT
They eat dinner

FIONA
It was one of those craft shows
where you look around and wonder
that the laws of supply and demand
have allowed for the production of
so Many macrame ducks

PHOEBE
God those are everywhere What do
you do with them

GRANT
Youve got one of those as a
little whatdoyoucallit light

fixutre holder or whatever it is

PHOEBE
I do not Oh wait a minute I do
Fiona gave it to me

FIONA
Yes I did

Fiona laughs holds up the wine bottle
FIONA

Would anyone like some more

She stops totally unable to find the wordshe’s looking for
FIONA
Some more

Grant looks at her looks at the HART’s to see their
reaction

FIONA
Ween

She furrows her brow Stares at the wine bottle

FIONA
Wane Wane

GRANT
No but I’1l have some wine

PHOEBE and William stare at her William breaks the silence

Fiona is skiing around the lake at sunset She looks
determined focussed Gradually she slows down

Glides a little Her focus becomes less clear her facemore
and more blank

FIONA (VO)

Half the time I wander around
looking for something which I know
is very pertinent But then I
can’t remember what I’m looking
foronce the idea is lost
everything is lost and I have to
wander around trying to figure out
what it was that was so important
earlier

Phoebe and Grant stare speechless

FIONA
I think I may be beginning to
disappear

PHOEBE
Oh Fiona Youve always been a
funny sort of person though haven’t
you I mean remember - youll
remember this Grant - Remember when
you two went to Florida that year
And Fiona left her fur coat in
storage and then just forgot about
it Remember that

GRANT
Oh that was unintentionally on
purpose Like it was a sin you were
leaving behind

Fiona sits back down at the table joining into the process
of brushing the awkwardness aside

FIONA
Well The way some people made me
feel about fur coats

They laugh Go back to more playful banter We move to look
out the window and move towards the snowy fields

GRANT (VO)
Uh How is your husband doing

MARIAN (VO)
He’s okay

EXT MARIANS HOUSE - FEBRUARY 2005 - MORNING 20

Marian still stands in the door (We will keep returning to
this scene throughout the film picking up right where we
left off)

GRANT
My wife and he struck up quite a

close friendship
MARIAN
I heard about that

GRANT
So I wanted to talk to you about
something if you had a minute

EXT WOODS - APRIL 2003-LATE AFTERNOON 21

Grant and Fiona walk together through the woods They reacha
little hollow skunk lilies everywhere They are the size of
platters and spring up like flames It’s surreal and
beautiful beyond belief Fiona and Grant look at each other
amazed Fiona bends down and touches one

Fiona looks at the flower Then away from it Then back at it
again Closes her eyes Opens them Grant watches her
quizzically

FIONA
When I look away I forget what
yellow means But I can look again

She pauses Thinks
FIONA
Sometimes there’s something
delicious in oblivion

Grant is moved

FIONA
They generate a heat of their own

Grant bends down to feel one

FIONA
They generate a heat of their own

She stops a minute Thinks She may have already said this
Looks at Grant hoping he didn’t catch it He smiles

GRANT
I don’t feel it

FIONA
I thinkI thinkyou’re supposed
to be able to put your hand inside

the curled petal and feel the heat

She tries it He watches her She looks up at him and smiles
This is a gorgeous place and they are both a bit
overwhelmed

GRANT
Well

FIONA
I can’t be sure I can’t be sure if
what I’m feeling is the heat or my
imagination

She stands up Changes her tone toa more certain one

FIONA
The heat attracts bugs

She begins to walk away

FIONA
Nature doesn’t fool around just
being decorative

Grant watches her walk away Looks around at the gorgeous
flowers savours the image of his wife walking through them
Then follows

GRANT’S MEMORY Grant and Fiona in their 20’s They walk
holding hands along the beach There are dividers every so
often Steel walls that have staircases on either side They
go up and down them Occasionally there is space between the
staircases so that you must walk balancing on thenarrow

EXT PARIS ONTARIO MAIN STREET- NOVEMBER 2003-DAY 27

We see her in the distance coming towards us down asteep
hill The occasional car stops and she walks aroundus
Finally she comes to a stop and just stands there looking
all around her perplexed A car comes to a stop in front of
her The driver is stunned Finally sort of leans on his
horn She looks into the car and waves politely but is still
distracted A police officer Buddy hears the horn honk and
comes out of a coffee shop and approaches her She is
patient Doesn’t rush her even though the driver is
obviously irate

BUDDY
Hi there Mrs Andersson

FIONA
Hi Buddy

She’s not really paying attention to him Still worried about
something

BUDDY
Would you like to have a coffee
with me Fiona I’m just inside
there In Cafe de Paris

FIONA
Oh I don’t drink coffee Buddy
Makes me go to the bathroom

BUDDY
Alright then I’1l buy you a tea

a bit of a hurry to keep driving on
up the road You know how he can
be

Fiona peers into the car again

FIONA
Oh Hi Mac Is that you Where are

Ministers name is

FIONA
If you don’t know that young lady
you really shouldn’t be in sucha
responsible job
Buddy laughs
FIONA
Listen Buddy You haven’t seen
Edith and George lately have you I
think they ran off on me
Buddy thinks for a moment

mutts she adopted some years ago

Oh A lifetime agoI think it may
have coincided with the discovery
that she was not likely to have
children Something about her tubes
being blocked or twisted - I can’t
remember now

Buddy looks at Grant across the dining roomtable Fiona skis
on the lake in the background

GRANT
I’m afraid I’ve always avoided
thinking about all thatfemale
apparatus

BUDDY
So they were dogs Dogs she had a
long time ago

Grant has a far off look

GRANT
She picked them up on one of her
more eccentric whims But they were
well looked after I think I may
have been picked up in much the
same way I don’t think I

understood that until quite
recently

He chuckles to himself

BUDDY
Have you been to see Dr Fischer
about this

GRANT
No I suppose I don’t really want
to hear what she has to say do I

BUDDY
You can’t just walk down the centre
of Main Street and then have
everything go back to normal

GRANT
No I realize that

FIONA
It’s 2003

DR FISCHER
And what is the Prime Ministers
Name

FIONA

It seems to me Grant that no one in
this town reads the paper

Grant and Dr Fishcer smile and glance atone another Fiona
catches this look and her eyes seemto hone in on something
between them Just as fast as this intensity came into her
eyes it goes away again

FIONA
Peter Martin

Grant lets out a small breath
DR FISCHER

And Fiona if you were to finda
letter on the street addressed

witha stamp on it What would you

Fiona looks at her

FIONA
I would mail it

DR FISCHER
And where would you put it to mail
it

Fiona is silent There is an endless pause

DR FISCHER
And if there was a fire in a movie
theater and you were the first one

§gspot the fire What would you

Another endless pause

FIONA
We don’t go to the movies much
anymore Do we Grant All those
multiplexes playing the same
American garbage Have you seen my

She begins to look around the room She gets up looking
under things behind the desk

GRANT
It’s on the back of the chair

you a few more questions Would you
mind taking a seat

They turn up the drive to their cottage Fiona looks at the
cottage as though for the first time

FIONA
When did we move into this cottage
Was it last year or the year
before

Grant stops the car Answers directly with courage

GRANT
It was longer than that It was
when I left the University About
20 years ago

Shakes her head casually surprised

FIONA
Hmmm That’s shocking

She looks at the brochures One for meadowlake a few on
living with Alzheimer’s They look at each other tenderly

MARIAN (contd)
He did not molest her in any way
He isn’t capable of it and he
wouldn’t anyway From what I heard
it was the other way round

No That isn’t it at all I didn’t
come here with any complaints about

anything

Oh Well I’m sorry I thought you
did

She doesn’t sound sorry She looks at himfor a moment

Fiona is pouring through books on Alzheimers Grant glances
at her over his paper every now and then

FIONA
“Never let a person make you feel
guilty for your anger with God”
Hmmm Random

GRANT
I don’t see what the point is We
can’t even be certain that this is
whatyou’re far too young

FIONA
There’s a reason it’s called “early
onset” dear Or maybe I’ve always
been a flake Oh I like this
“Apraxia is usually present early
in Alzheimer’s diseaseIn the
early stages apraxia may be more
apparent when the patient faces
several choices He may have no
difficulty putting his shirt on
A epe ne Fase Nae aay ELS SEs
and coats he may become confused
as to which one to pick first”

She thinks about this

FIONA
(with weight)
They left you undiagnosed a long
time

She lets out a little laugh

She lets this hang between them They stare ateach other
Something unspoken but clear She flicks through pages A
tense silence Then she begins to read again

FIONA
Should the patient afflicted with
the disease remain at home the
caregiver will very often be the
spouse

INT ANDERSSON’S KITCHEN -FLASHBACK WINTER 2003- SUNSET 38

Over Fiona’s reading we see A pot of water sits on the
stove untended forgotten about Grant approaches it Looks
at it sad He slowly removes it from the element We stayon
his face for a long time He looks out the window at Fiona
skiing around the large field in the pink sunset She waves
cheerfully He waves back She continues skiing until she
gradually comes to a stop gliding alittle We see the
earlier sequence that she told the Hart’s about from hisPOV
through the window

FIONA (VO)
The caregiver must preside over the
degeneration of someone he or she
loves very much must do this for
years and years with the news
always getting worsenot better
»-must every few months learn to
compensate for new shortcomings
with makeshift remediesmust
negotiate impossible requests and
fantastic observationsmust put up
sometimes with deranged but at the
same time very personal insults
and must somehow learn to smile
through it all

FIONA (V0O) (contd)
Caregivers must be able to diagnose
a wide variety of ordinary ailments
under extraordinary circumstances
Imagine the person you love the
most suddenly upset about something
but completely unable to
communicate the problem or even to
understand it himself

sings along to the music

take phone calls for the first
thirty days To give the resident
time to adjust

What kind of visitors

MADELEINE
Everyone Even close family

Grant looks taken aback

GRANT
I couldnt just leave her here
32A

MADELEINE
Well we understand this is really
the hard part

(MORE )

MADELEINE (contd)
But most people need that time to
get settled in Before we had the
rule in place they’d often forget
over and over again why they were
being left here Whereas we find
if they have a month to adjust
they end up happys as clams
Meadowlake’s their home then After
that it’s perfectly fine for them
to take a little visit home every
now and then Of course that
doesn’t apply to the ones on the
second floor It’s too difficult

and they don’t know where they are

anyway

GRANT
My wife isn’t going to the second
floor

MADELEINE

No I just like to make everything
clear at the outset

Kristy is heading out the door with a binder She gives Grant
a squeeze on the shoulder

promise

these gorgeous flowers These skunk
lilies

KRISTY
Those are beautiful aren’t they

GRANT
They really made an impression you
see And today even though the
whole place was covered in snow
she said “Oh Remember” Now that
was quite recently About nine
months ago Isn’t the short term
memory the thing that goes first

Well Yes But not all at once And
what’s comforting is the long term
memory sometimes stays for quite a
long time

very intact

Rpis bas a weight to it She looks at him carefully
Sorbing his

INT DINING AREA - FEBRUARY 2004-MORNING 95

Residents sit along the walls in easy chairs others at
tables in the middle of the carpeted floor The same man that
was playing the piano during Grant’s tour plays it again
now Picking away with one finger and never achieving a tune
A group of residents sit and play cards Grant sees Fiona in
profile sitting up close to the cardtable but not playing
She is sitting very closely beside the manin the wheelchair
She looks a little different Her hair is pulled back in an
unfamiliar style Her usual red lipstick gone Kristy comes
up behind Grant

KRISTY
There she is You just go up and
say hello and try not to startle
her Remember she may not - Well
Just go ahead

Kristy looks concerned Grant walks towards the table As he
approaches all the card players look up including Fiona
The rest of the players look back down at their cards again
except Fiona She smiles her sly charming smile pushes back
her chair and comes around to him putting her fingers to her
mouth

FIONA
(whispering)
Bridge Deadly Serious Theyre
quite rabid about it

She draws him towards the coffee table Sits him down beside
her Speaks to him very politely as you would an
acquaintance

FIONA
I can remember being like that for
a while at college My friends and
I would cut class and sit in the
common room and smoke and play like
cutthroats One’s name was Phoebe
I dont remember the others

GRANT
Phoebe Hart

FIONA
You knew her too Can I get you
anything A cup of tea I’m afraid

the coffee isn’t up to much here

GRANT
I don’t drink tea

Grant is paralysed He wants to throwhis arms around her but
something about her demeanour makes it impossible At a loss
he searches around for something to say

GRANT
I brought you some flowersI
thought they’d do to brighten up
your room I went to your room but
you weren’t there

FIONA
Well no I’m here

There is an awkward pause

GRANT
Youve made a new friend

He indicates the man in the wheelchair The man looks up
Fiona looks back at him

FIONA
It’s just Aubrey The funny thing
is I knew him years and years ago
He worked in the store The
hardware store where my grandpa
used to shop He and I were always
kidding around and he could not get
up the nerve to ask me out Till
the very last weekend and he took
me to a ball game But when it was
over my grandpa showed up to drive
me home I was up visiting for the
summer Visiting my grandparents -
they lived in a cottage on the
lake

GRANT
Fiona I know where your
grandparents lived It’s where we
lived Live

Fiona is distracted by Aubrey’s look He is looking at her
quite intensely with a kind of command inhis eyes

FIONA
Really

Fiona turns back to Grant nervously

FIONA
I better go back He thinks he
can’t play without me sitting
there

FIONA (contd)
It’s silly I hardly know the game
anymore I’m afraid you’1ll have to
excuse me

GRANT
Will you be through soon

FIONA
Oh we should be It depends If you
go and ask that grim looking lady
nicely she’1ll get you some tea

She indicates a particularly stern looking attendant behind a
coffee urn

GRANT
I’m fine

FIONA
So Ill leave you then you can
entertain yourself It must all
seem strange to you but you’ll be
surprised how soon you get used to
it Youll get to know who
everybody is Except that some of
them are pretty well off in the
clouds you know - you can’t expect
them all to get to know who you
are

She leaves Grant and goes back to her chair at the table She
whispers something into Aubrey’s ear and taps her fingers
across the back of his hand Grant watches them for a while
Then gets up and leaves As he does Aubrey gives hima
suspicious look Fiona gives him a polite little wave

They watch Aubrey and Fiona It is difficult for Aubrey to
manage the cards Fiona shuffles and deals for him and
sometimes moves quickly to straighten a card that seems tobe
slipping from his grasp A wisp of Fiona’s hair touches his
face and he gives a husbandly frown

Fiona pushes her chair back and comes overto greet Grant

funny it’s often with some of the

with each other at all They maybe
won’t even know each other beyond
knowing like is it a man or a

So I think you came here for a
reason I’m the kind you can just
say things flat out to So shoot

Grant takes a breath and then takes the plunge

GRANT
I’m wondering if you could consider
taking Aubrey back to Meadowlake
Maybe just one day a week for a
visit It’s only a drive of a few
miles it wouldn’t be too difficult
would it

He has an idea

GRANT
Orif you’d like to take the time
off - I suppose I could take Aubrey
out there myself I wouldn’t mind
at all

This wasn’t part of what he had planned to say and he’s
rather dismayed to hear himself suggest it

GRANT
I’m sure I could manage it And I’m
sure you could use a break

While he talks she moves her closed lips and her hidden
tongue as if she is trying to identify some dubious flavour
She gets up and gets some milk Pours it into his coffee
Goes back to the counter and grabs a plate of ginger cookies
They are perfectly round She sets the plate downin front of
him

MARIAN
Homemade

GRANT picks one up Marvels at its perfect roundness

GRANT
Really

She pours milk into her coffeeStirs it GRANT waits inthe
interminable awkward silence Glances at AUBREY’s feet
visible through the door

MARIAN
No No I can’t do that And the
reason is I’m not going to upset
him

GRANT
(earnest)
Would it upset him

MARIAN
Yes it would It would Bringing
him home and taking him back
Bringing him home and taking him
back that’s just confusing him

GRANT
But wouldn’t he understand that it
was just a visit Wouldn’t he get
into the pattern of it

MARIAN
He understands everything all
right

She says this as though he has just insulted AUBREY

MARIAN

If I go to all that trouble Id
prefer to take him someplace that
was more funIt’d make more sense
to take him to the mall where he
could see kids and whatnot If it
didn’t make him sore about his own
two grandsons he never gets to see
I’ve got to get him all ready and
pack up his chair and maneuver him
into the car and he’s a big man
he’s not so easy to manage as you
might think All that and what for

GRANT
But even if I agreed to do it It’s
true you shouldnt have the
trouble

(flatly TAN
You couldn’ You don’t know him

You couldn’t handle him

he get out of it

Grant’s mind wanders momentarily remembering the
circumstances in which he quit

MARIAN
I’ve quit quitting

She lights up

Just made a resolution to quit
quitting that’s all

catch him and holds onto him Grant doesn’t know whether to

help or not Decides he’d better not

holds it

Into our provinces of persecution

Only the mad will never never come

They want belief again in their own

And the artist prays ever so gently-

‘Let me find pure all that can

Let me perceive the images of

KRISTY
But you know once they get a walker

don’t walk much anymore just get
wherever it is they have to go

Grant scratches his head Looks worried

more about it

KRISTY
Well It’s for people who have

really lost it

GRANT
And what do they do What happens
after they’velost it

KRISTY
Some just sit Some sit and cry
Some try to holler the house down
You don’t really want to know
Butsometimes they get it back
You go in their rooms for a year
and they don’t know you from Adam
Then one day it’s “oh hi when
are we going home” All of a sudden
theyre absolutely back to normal
again

Grant looks vaguely hopeful

KRISTY
But not for long You think wow
back to normal And then they’re
gone again

She snaps her fingers

KRISTY
Like so

Grant stares off Tears in his eyes

pick yourself back up like everyone

GRANT
I suppose I suppose our lives
must seem easy to you We got
through life without too much going
wrong What we have to suffer now
that we’re old hardly counts I
suppose That’s what you must
think

Kristy stares at him shocked at the condescensim in his
tone And thouroughly insulted by the sentiment There is a
lot of anger in her eyes She half smiles glaring

KRISTY
You don’t know what I think To
tell you the truth I’d rather be
the one who stayed than the one who
left Ill bet you weren’t always
the doggedly devoted husband Am I
right When you said you thought
maybe she was punishing you for
something I‘ll bet maybe you had
something pretty specific in mind

MARIAN
Hello Grant I’m Marian

He shakes her hand tentatively

MARIAN
So now we know each other’s name
there’s no point in not telling you
straight out what I think I don’t
know if he’s still so stuck on
seeing your - on seeing Fiona Or
not I don’t ask him and he’s not
telling me But I don’t feel like
taking him back there in case it
turns out to be more than that I
can’t afford to risk it I don’t
want him getting hard to
handleI’ve got my hands full with

hat 3s rth siGust MHEG AY

GRANT
Did you ever consider - it zs very
hard for you - did you ever
consider his going in there for
good

MARIAN doesn’t seem to feel the needto lower her voice

MARIAN
No I’m keeping him right here
GRANT
Well That’s very good and noble of
you
MARIAN

You think so Noble is not what I’m
thinking about

GRANT
Still It’s not easy

MARIAN
No it isn’t See I don’t have much
of a choice If I put him in there
I don’t have the money to pay for
him unless I sell the house The
house is what we own outright
Otherwise I don’t have anything in
the way of resources I get my
pension next year but even so I
could not afford to keep him there
and hang on to the house And it
means a lot to me my house does

GRANT
It’s very nice

MARIAN
Well it’s alright I put a lot
into it Fixing it up and keeping
it up

GRANT
I’m sure you did You do

No

MARIAN
I’m not going to lose it

GRANT
I see your point

MARIAN
The company left us high and dry
Basically he got shoved out It

ERSR REY Eha HRB PY LEI eS Hi na
out what was what he just went on
saying it’s none of my business
What I think is he was doingwell
he was pretty stupid But I’m not
supposed to ask so I shut up
Youve been married You are
married You know how it is And in
the middle of all this were
supposed to go on this trip with
these people and can’t get out of
it And on the trip he takes sick
from this virus youve never heard
of and goes into a coma So that
pretty well gets Azm off the hook

GRANT
Bad luck

MARIAN
I don’t mean exactly that he got
sick on purpose It just happened
He’s not mad at me anymore and I’m
not mad at him It’s just life

GRANT
That’s true

You can’t beat life

She flicks her tongue in acat’s businesslike way across her
top lip getting the cookie crumbs

probably a mistake putting him in

wasn’t going to get another chance
so I took it So Now I know
better

She shakes out another cigarette

MARIAN
You’re thinking - there’s a
mercenary type of a person

GRANT
I’m not making judgements of that
sort It’s your life

Ah Monica What do you think

MARIAN
I’m thinking that sometimes you
just have to make a decision to be
happy You just decide Things
aren’t ever what you hoped they’d
be Not ever Not for anybody The
only thing that separates one kind
of person from the other is that
there are some who stay angry about
it and there are some who accept
what comes their way

GRANT
Which kind of person are you

MARIAN all of a sudden looks very vulnerable All her
hardness just melts away

MARIAN
I was pretty damn mad But right
nowI’m looking at what came my
wayand I thinkmaybe I could
become the other kind of person

Marian gets embarrassed by how much she has revealed and
laughs it off

dress She has the Auden book in her lap She looks up at
Grant and smiles

FIONA
Look at this beautiful book I
found it’s about Iceland You
wouldn’t think they’d leave
valuable books lying around in the
rooms The people staying here are
not necessarily honest And I think
theyve got the clothes mixed up I
never wear yellow

She runs her fingers over the book tenderly

I seem to FagMtber you reading this

feel better You tried so hard

Fiona rvé Nught a surprise for

She stares at him for a moment as if waves of wind have come
beating into her face Into her face into her head pulling
everything to rags

FIONA
Names elude me

The look passes as she retrieves with aneffort some
bantering grace She sets down the book carefully and stands
up She lifts her arms to put them around him He holds her
astonished Settles into the embrace She pulls his earlobes

FIONA

She smiles smells his shirt

FIONA

Just driven away without a care in
the world and forsook me Forsooken
me Forsaken

He keeps his face against her white hair her pink scalp her
sweetly shaped skull With tears in his eyes hesays

GRANT
