stages in recovery Some

temporary others longer term

Were going to do an MRI Try to

Martin stares out the window not fighting hardly
listening

A bird alights on a branch

FARGE (CONTD)
The mind is like a jigsaw puzzle
The pieces fit together to create
the person we are With major
trauma the puzzle is shattered
But the brains ability to
recover is remarkable The mind
needs a narrative an identity
a soul Without memory without
a past we are nothing In the
coma state memories are rebuilt
In some cases the pieces move
In others they go missing And

sometimes completely new
pieces are found
The bird flies off Martins eyes track empty

line If I didnt have the exact
edition of the book the code
would be unbreakable

Theyd work for whoever would pay
-- public sector private sector
Second-to-none in their planning
and efficiency They never
failed Whats more they were
invisible Theyd strike and
nobody would even know there had

been foul play It was only

rumor of course

inside his packet Jurgen looking steadily back at him
Takes a deep gulp of coffee

You had fifteen minutes after I
called Why didnt you run

Where would I run from Section

Restoring some dignity to him
