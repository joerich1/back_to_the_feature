MY BEST FRIENDS WEDDING

Ronald Bass
First Draft Screenplay

INT BOULEY RESTAURANT NEW YORK - NIGHT

Dim lighting crowd buzz a long line of the rich the celebrated
the congenitally impatient Everyone in this queue holds a
reservation at least an hour overdue Tourists cant even make the
line PAN ahead to

the burnished dining room the tables of power the elegant
service Covertly many eyes are drawn to the one table receiving
by far the most lavish service of all Captains hover presenting
delicacies pouring wines murmuring obsequiously to a guest whose
person they screen from our view We can see however

the honored guests companion Ignored bemused across the
table This is DIGGER DOWNES 36 darkly attractive Kind eyes
an intellectuals mouth Saville Rows most unobtrusive and
conservative chalk-stripe suit He is gay but you wouldnt guess
it Loyal and wise and generous and you might He watches with a
quiet twinkle as the Captains now step back revealing to us

their most unlikely icon JULIANNE POTTER almost 28 wears
her favorite bulky sweater over a bunch of other stuff she pulled
together in fifteen seconds She is unkempt quick volatile
scattered and beneath it all perhaps because of it all an
original beauty Dark liquid eyes a cynical mouth slender
expressive fingers which point to

CAPTAIN
A variation on our squid ink
risotto Trace of Moselle to
sweeten the stock

She doesnt like that idea at all Shoots him a sharp look of
doubt that makes him smile Murmur

CAPTAIN
Dont kill us on this one its
a long shot
Places the moist lump of black rice before her She takes a
surprisingly small amount rolls it over her tongue Makes dead
flat eye contact with Digger And nods its actually quite nice
The Captain breathes with relief She turns her dark eyes to him
The tone says theyre pals

JULIANNE
Im writing it up as inventive and
confident Which it is Off the
record Ill need an extra boat of
the ink Or a salt shaker

CAPTAIN
Ill toss a coin

As the Captain splits Digger looks around at the other tables
which makes many pairs of eyes awkwardly glace away

DIGGER
Is it ever embarrassing having
your bum kissed in public

JULIANNE
If your ass isnt chapped you
are not a good-writer of note

She glances at her two remaining waiters who shamelessly fawn
nearby

JULIANNE
Is it sad to be an editor and bask
only in reflected insincerity

DIGGER
Ive adjusted and thanks for asking

She leans forward as if sharing something conspiratorial

JULIANNE
See the pull of a book like
Twenty Chefs is not who I
put in Its who I leave out

DIGGER
Which is everyone you couldnt
get in

JULIANNE
Plus some guys whose food I dont
like

Pushes the risotte across to him He lifts a fork

DIGGER
This fellow from Newsday ever
call
She shrugs Pulls a cellular out of a large jumbled bag

JULIANNE
Ill buzz my machine Inventive
and confident yeh

She dials He tastes

DIGGER
Needs salt

JULIANNE
Is Newsday a real interview or
just some cute guy youre setting
me up w

DIGGER
I dont send you men anymore
You dont know what to do with them

Shes punching in her code

JULIANNE
Sometimes I do Like for two months

DIGGER
weeks

Over the phone we hear her answering machine

MANS VOICE (VO soft)
Hey Its Michael

And her face changes Warms Just to hear the guileless voice

MICHAEL (VO)
God it must be what months huh
I cant wait to talk to you Im
in Chicago at the Ritz Carlton

She looks impressed and surprised Fancy place for this guy
MICHAEL (VO)
Call me four in the morning

whatever we gotta talk

As she hangs up She still has that look in her eye Digger has
never seen that and he likes it very much

DIGGER
Who called The man of the

moment

She smiles A sweet natural smile that makes us like her too
The Bohemian sophisticate has vanished

JULIANNE
No no the opposite Thats
my best friend Michael ONeal
He sounds desperate to talk

DIGGER
The wandering sportswriter

He pushes the risotto back her way

DIGGER
I didnt know you two had a
past
Her gaze sharpens Hmmn
DIGGER

The look in your eye
She blushes Shakes her head no way

JULIANNE
Sophomore year at Yale we had
this one hot month And you
know me I got restless

He knows her She got restless

JULIANNE
So I get up the nerve to break
his heart I tell him theres
this dreamy exchange student
from Pakistan who wants to
you know

He knows

JULIANNE

And he gets this look He
says I knew I couldnt hold
your interest which of course
makes me feel like the shallow
bitch Ive always been

He nods yeah

JULIANNE
Then he says But what makes
me want to cry Is Im losing
the best friend I ever had

Hears the feeling In her voice
JULIANNE
And when he said it I knew

I felt the same

Silence now She covers with a smile
JULIANNE
So I cried For maybe the third
time in my life And I kissed
him And weve been best friends
ever since

Ever since Fingers turning her wine glass

JULIANNE

Nine years weve seen each other
through everything Losing jobs
losing parents losing lovers
travelled all over weve had the
best times The best times of my
life maybe Just drinking and
talking Even over a phone

DIGGER
Kindred spirits

JULIANNE
No hes nothing like me Hes
like you Only straight

No offense taken

JULIANNE
Hes the salt of the earth Kind
and loyal and generous The one
constant thing in my life is hell
always be there

DIGGER
Hes still in love with you

That stops her She has to say
JULIANNE

Maybe But it never gets in
the way

Something she probably hasnt confessed out loud before

understands

DIGGER
Well he has a true friend in
you

He wants her to know he sees that
DIGGER
Whenever George tells someone
how steadfast I am he always

makes me sound boring

JULIANNE

Digger
Solid and genuine is not boring
Michael can be completely insane

A young waiter arrives Sets a boat of black squid ink beside her
plate

JULIANNE
There was this one night in
Tucson like six years ago
we got amazingly drunk I mean
Keith Richards time

The kid tops off her glass of meursault Looking at her

JULIANNE
God I havent thought of this
in so long

The waiter hanging now Openly listening

JULIANNE
I can even believe we did
this

Digger sees the guy listening gestures to her with his eyes So
she looks up

JULIANNE
Could you give us a minute

The kid stunned speechless People lose jobs for a lot less

JULIANNE
You wont miss much I promise
there was no sex

He reddens and disappears

DIGGER
Ive lost interest

JULIANNE
He takes a razor from his dinky
little dopp kit cuts his fingertip
takes my hand does the same to me

She places the tips of her index fingers together

DIGGER
Blood oath

JULIANNE
He says Swear When were both
28 if weve never been married
we marry each other

And laughs again Can you believe that But Digger isnt smiling
She wonders why Begins to spoon black squid ink onto her risotto

JULIANNE
See he figured that would be a
sign from God or someone of
comparable authority that wed
misunderstood our destinies

He still has this real serious look Shes still spooning ink

JULIANNE
We never talked about it again I
dont know what made me think of

DIGGER (quietly)
I do

And everything Stops She lifts her spoon mesmerized by the
gravity of his tone

DIGGER
Youll be 28 in three weeks
How old is he

Holy Fucking Shit It hits her like a ton of lead bricks She
shovels some swampy risotto into her mouth without looking

JULIANNE
You think

DIGGER
Desperate To talk

She shovels in more drippy black goop It is really disgusting

JULIANNE
Hes not proposing marriage
theres no way Im buying one
word of th

DIGGER
Then why are you compulsively
eating If youre not hysterical

More goes in Her lips and mouth completely black Like a circus
clown

JULIANNE
He cant do that to me

DIGGER
Were about to find out

Ink is now dribbling out of the black hole of her mouth and down
her face She absently dabs a napkin keeping some of it from
reaching her sweater
JULIANNE
When I turn him down

She realizes the full weight of the truth

JULIANNE
Well never be the same

DIGGER
I have a suggestion

JULIANNE
Ill have to kill myself before I
call him

Staring in each others eyes

DIGGER (sadly)
That was it

INT JULIANNES BATHROOM - LATE NIGHT

Julianne furiously scrubs her blackened tongue with a toothbrush
Gray foam pours from her mouth spattering the oversized basketball
jersey she wears as a nightshirt In the mirror her troubled eyes
dwell on Michael flick to the cordless phone standing ominously on
the closed toilet lid

She spits sticks her tongue way out Incredibly black Great
Depressed terrified and disfigured for life She snatches up the
hated phone and wanders aimlessly into

her bedroom West Village view Defiantly jumbled aggres-
sively eclectic Traces of wonderful taste mixed with I-like-it-
you-got-a-problem-with-that She stumbles around rehearsing

JULIANNE
This is awkward timing Michael
I just joined this convent and
they never give your deposit ba

Stops Full-length mirror She straightens her hair to look her
best

JULIANNE
Michael Im married

Not enough

JULIANNE

Changes tone
JULIANNE

Michael Im trying to be gay

She turns to continue pacing and walks straight INTO a dresser
Stuns her momentarily Enough already She punches up the
number primping absently in the mirror When it connects

JULIANNE
I was calling Michael ONeal
but seeing its so late I could
just leave a mes

No such luck Cut off Waits And then

JULIANNE (soft)

hopes of improvement but finally

MICHAEL (VO urgent)

JULIANNE (bright)
I just have to tell you this one

of your adult life

Silence Come on girl suck it up

JULIANNE
I was thinking about you and I
remembered this unbelievably insane
night we spent together in Tucson

More silence Really quiet
JULIANNE
I mean theres no way you could
possibly remember the

MICHAEL (V0O soft)
Are you kidding

Stops her Like a brick wall The sweetness in his voice

MICHAEL (VO)
I think about that night all
the time

Shes going to have a heart attack

MICHAEL (VO)
But its not why I called

She blinks Its not And just as a tsunami of relief begins to
sweep away

MICHAEL (VO)
I called because I met someone

And her smiles breaks off Like a spine snapping Because there is
something in his voice

JULIANNE
Well thats great You havent
really had anybody since Dingbat
Jennylee

MICHAEL (VO)

INT DIGGERS CHEROKEE JFK AIRPORT - EARLY MORNING

Digger driving the open-air Cherokee up the ramp to United Airlines
departures Julianne wind-whipped trying to light a fresh
cigarette from the butt of the last one He glances over Hates
to see this

DIGGER
You cant get lung cancer and
die in four days Go to Plan B

She sucks deep Really deep

JULIANNE
You have no appropriate sense
of emergency My best friend

them from themselves

DIGGER
You have a real philosophy of
life

JULIANNE

She is tight enough to snap And at the edge of tears Staring
out at the skycaps clinging to her cigarette as he eases to the
curb

DIGGER (gently)
Why dont we have a drink You

JULIANNE
Im a busy girl Ive got four
days to break up a wedding and
steal the brides fella

She finally looks at him He doesnt say anything

JULIANNE
Hes adored me for nine goddamn
years

DIGGER

I can see why
JULIANNE
She knows him maybe five seconds
plus she has billions of dollars
plus shes perfect so dont go
feeling sorry for Miss Pre-Teen Illinois

Hes not So her voice softens Which shows the hurt
JULIANNE
And dont go feeling sorry for
me you dont know me that well

DIGGER (softly)
I stand corrected

Tears now Stand in her eyes

JULIANNE
Im making a big mistake huh

DIGGER (shrugs)
Maybe youll learn something

He wraps his hand over hers She looks down at it
JULIANNE
Im gonna bring him back man
Against all odds yknow Cos

She wraps her fingers around his

JULIANNE
I gotta live with it forever

Looks in his eyes
JULIANNE
And at my wedding Ill be the
only bride with her own best man

And she kisses his cheek

Jumps out of his car Before she cries Yanks her bags from the
back Brave smile

They trade small salutes And then shes gone

INT OHARA AIRPORT CHICAGO - MORNING

The jetway disgorging passengers into the swarming ant colony
called OHare Julianne lugging multiple carry-ons trying to pull

fly-away strands of hair into place nervous as a schoolgirl
looking all around and
there he is MICHAEL is tall and square-shouldered a boyish
grin an unruly shock of hair He looks gorgeous sweet and just
dangerous enough to be irresistible Worthwhile stakes His face
lights to see her and she

RUNS to his arms shedding bags along the way slamming off
heedless civilians to be

SWEPT OFF the earth in strong arms spun around laughing like
crazy their cheeks tight together When he sets her down

he kisses her nose His arms are still around her

MICHAEL (murmurs)
Can you believe it Can you believe
Im actually gonna do this

JULIANNE (lost in his eyes)
Not hardly

He beams Turns She follows his gaze and

there she is KIMBERLY WALLACE is 20 small and slender but it
is a body to die for The face is striking not at all perky and
vapid but lovely and interesting Worst of all intelligent

She walks toward them purposefully her eyes locked to the woman in
her fiancees arms At the last moment Michael releases Julianne
and Kimmy

THROWS her arms around the startled visitor HOLDS her tight
with such genuine warmth that Julianne can only slowly hug back
As Michael beams

KIMMY
This just makes everything so
perfect

Her arms stay around the slightly dazed Julianne The younger
girl leans close confides

KIMMY
All Ive heard from the day I
met Michael is Julianne this
and Julianne that

JULIANNE
Well were

KIMMY
I think the best part of marrying
this guy is finding you

Pale gray eyes Alive with joy and intimacy

KIMMY
Ive never had a sister
INT KIMMYS CONVERTIBLE - DAY

Kimmy TEARING down the throughway in her Mercedes 500 SL a
dashing confident driver Julianne riding shotgun hair flying a
total wreck in the open convertible Michael is happily crouched
on the little platform behind their seats hugging his knees The
roar of the wind makes it impossible for him to hear them

KIMMY
My hearts in my throat here
Right off I have to ask this

monstrous favor

JULIANNE
You need a few dollars

Kim glances over At eighty miles an hour A bittersweet look

KIMMY
Dry Just like he said

Her eyes at once admiring and regretful

JULIANNE
Excuse me
KIMMY
I can be quick I can even

be funny
Shakes her head An endearing youngster

KIMMY
But I cant be dry

JULIANNE
Can you watch the road

KIMMY
See Dry Its in the delivery

She looks back to the highway

KIMMY
This is a very presumptuous
and burdensome fav

JULIANNE
you want a menage on your
wedding night

KIMMY (straight back)
No that wouldnt be burdensome

Julianne studying the delicate angular profile Hard not to like
this kid
KIMMY
My classmate Angelique shattered
her pelvis line dancing in
Abeline on Spring Break

Looks over The sweetest smile

KIMMY
Be my maid of honor

Julianne just blinks

KIMMY
You cant believe what itd
cost to bring in a temp

JULIANNE
Uh How about promoting a
bridesmaid Someone you know
for at least forty-five minutes

We CUT OFF a huge SEMI who BLASTS his horn Kimmy fearless
oblivious and analytical

KIMMY
The bridesmaids are my only two
female relatives under forty
Identical twin debutantes from
Nashville who are basically
vengeful sluts With amazing

bodies

JULIANNE
Which was the disqualifying
factor

KIMMY

The twin part I like to remain
impartial in my contempt

Sees the off-ramp and SLICES across FOUR LANES of speeding bullets
in a heart-stopping nanosecond This kid could drive for Penske
Julianne has to pound her chest to get her heart started Looks
back to see if Michael fell out

he is absurdly wind-blown Gives her a beautiful grinning
thumbs-up Loves this stuff

KIMMY
This means I have four days
to make you my new best friend

Brings Juliannes eyes back

KIMMY
And since I already know everything
about you Including intimate
facts Im mortified to have heard
but too envious to forget Its
time for you to learn about me

Easing off the freeway She meets Juliannes glance

KIMMY
Force yourself To get personal

JULIANNE (smiles)
Sounds like a plan

INT DRESS SHOP NORTH MICHIGAN AVENUE - MORNING

The place is stunning High-ceiling soft light large rococo
mirrors Louis Quatorze sofas and chairs Michael wanders rest-—
lessly fish out of water among designer displays and stylish
female patrons

Takes a look at his watch

INT DRESSING ROOM —- MORNING

A period sitting room ringed with mirrors along its tapestried
walls Kimmy sits on a Louis Treize loveseat next to a stack of
costly gowns Watching with an expertise beyond her years as
Julianne stands on a platform A seamstress fitting her into a
sleek pale daffodil-colored gown There are pins everywhere as
the seamstress struggles toward a perfect fit Continuously

looking to Kim for approval

KIMMY
If youd rather the lilac

Julianne shakes her head This one is beautiful
JULIANNE
I thought bridesmaids had to wear
the same dress
KIMMY
Not you You wont be comfortable
unless youre distinctive

Julianne glances over

JULIANNE
What else did he tell you

KIMMY
you hate weddings you never go

Oh Well yeah

KIMMY
Youre not up for anything
conventional or popularly
assumed to be female priorities
Including marriage Or romance
Or even

And she stops Not wanting to offend

JULIANNE (quietly)
- not even love

The look holds The seamstress keeps working as if shes deaf

JULIANNE
Thats why Michael and I were
the wrong fit Right from the
start

KIMMY
He said that too

She stands up Walks to the platform Smooths her hand over the
fabric down Juliannes back along her hips Communicating to the
seamstress with her irritated expression

KIMMY
Well I thought I was like you
And proud to be Until I met
rumpled smelly old Michael

Pins start to come out Kimmy points these too

KIMMY
And then I found I was just a
sentimental schmuck Like all
those flighty nitwits Id always
pitied

She leans forward So they can look at each other

KIMMY
Funny world huh

Julianne swallows It is that

JULIANNE
I need a smoke

And before anyone can breathe she steps OFF the platform RIPPING
the living shit out of the gown right down the side The seam-
stress eyes FLASH OPEN in abject horror Julianne a deer in
headlights looks quickly around at the evidence of her screw-up in
six different mirrors

Kimberly just steps to her fingers the tear

KIMMY
Its mostly the seam Lets
get this to Carlos

And UNZIPS Julianne down the back In her rush to step out
Julianne STUMBLES but her arms are pinned by the pulled-down dress
and she just

» TOPPLES like a felled oak THUDDING on her face the gown
RIPPING some more the seamstress SCREAMING like an idiot

Then Silence Julianne looking up helplessly a trussed hog
bound in her dress

KIMMY (firm)
Just Dont Move

Like you talk to a three-year-old Deftly Kimmy pulls the
dress free leaving Julianne in her underwear Signals to the
seamstress lets go

JULIANNE
Dont you have to be somewh

KIMMY
just my bridal shower And
Michael has to meet our dads and
the groomsmen at Comiskey for a
one-thirty game

Opens the door

KIMMY
Other than that

Closed SOLID Gone
INT DRESSING ROOM - LATER

Julianne sits on the loveseat in her bra and panties lighting one
cigarette from the butt of another Suddenly she hears

an ARGUMENT outside the door Strains to listen It does sound
like Michael and Kim We cant make out the words She jumps up
dashes for the door STUBBING her toe on the platform SHIT falls
heavily AGAINST the door with a THUD that makes her wince and

the argument stops Damn She opens the door a crack Sees
nothing Opens it wider to reveal

a teenaged BOY looking right at her He sends a true shit-
eating grin and she SLAMS the door hard enough to RATTLE walls

She PACES furiously helplessly arms around her half-naked self
until

soft knock The door opens a crack and her daffodil gown
comes through it
JULIANNE
Come in and shut the

Stops Because its Michael who has entered With the dress

JULIANNE
door

So he does She flushes and SNATCHES up her own clothes which
were characteristically tangled in a heap and tries desperately to
untangle them enough to cover herself He is amazed and amused by
her embarrassment

MICHAEL (laughing)
Should I turn around or someth

JULIANNE
Michael Im in my underwear

Shes TEARING at her clothes only making more of a mess

MICHAEL
Weve seen each other a lot
more naked than this

She seems ready to rip her clothes apart so he gently takes them
from her hands She tries to stand unselfconsciously as he easily
untangles them

MICHAEL
I mean we were skinny-dipping
in Greece just as pals less
than two years ago

She GRABS the clothes and covers the front of herself Looking at
him with a mix of emotions she couldnt begin to sort out

JULIANNE
Things are different now

He looks in her eyes And nods a little sadly Guess they are
MICHAEL (softly)
Well I leave with two thoughts
in my mind
He walks to the door Puts his hand on the latch Looks back
MICHAEL (even softer)
Youre still a very pretty
girl

The look holds And holds There is such feeling on both sides
she doesnt know what to make of it She swallows

JULIANNE
Whats the sec

MICHAEL
Mirrors

And hes gone She looks around at six different VIEWS of her
uncovered backside Hmm

INT HOTEL UNDERGROUND GARAGE - DAY

The parking valets wait by their stand as the convertible pulls up
These girls must be late for something the way theyre jumping out
of the car

JULIANNE

Fucking Hemisphere is all Ims

KIMMY

JULIANNE

Theyre walking fast toward the garage elevators

KIMMY

Well

KIMMY
It depends If San Antonio sweeps
Sacramento we could start there

Clevel

JULIANNE

choice of Embassy Suit
At the elevator Kimmy SLAMS the button

KIMMY
Its his career Im supportive
Look Ive been everywhere Ive
seen the world Ive laid on a beach
I want to be with the man I love

An empty elevator arrives They get in

JULIANNE
Takes one woman in a billion to

The guy is a one-man festival of
idiosync

Kimmy SLAMS the penthouse button Looks at her calmly Go on

JULIANNE
Well Youve been introduced
to the symphonic range of

KIMMY
his snoring yeah He says
its worse than ever That
snaffle one

Julianne imitates an incredibly annoying high-pitched SNARL Three
times Kimmy nods

KIMMY
Well now it has this sorta
phlegm rattle behind it

Stopped at the lobby A family of four gets in Oblivious Kimmy
DEMONSTRATES the phlegm rattle Really gets into it As the
family watches Julianne tries her own version Like that No
More like this The family is looking at each other

KIMMY
Guess what Earplugs work

Oh

JULIANNE
How about

KIMMY
Cigars in bed I broke him
on that But the bathrooms a
swamp he wears Reeboks to dinner
tells the same admittedly funny
jokes three hundred times

Sucks in a breath

KIMMY
loves action movies subscribes
to Playboy for godsake reads over
my shoulder cant keep track of
the checks he writes

Ninth floor The family gets out The door closes
KIMMY

He sucks soup through his
front teeth

JULIANNE
A trademark move dont touch
it

KIMMY

But he sure can kiss

JULIANNE
Its been awhile Ill take
your word

KIMMY
After two weeks of cataloguing
all his faults I made a command
decision that changed my life

She SLAMS the EMERGENCY STOP button We JOLT to a halt

KIMMY
I threw the list away

Shakes her head

KIMMY
Hes not a balance sheet so
many wonderful qualities so
many faults Hes Michael

From her heart
KIMMY
And loving him means loving
all of this
JULIANNE
Do you get nervous in small

confined spaces

KIMMY
So its sweet of you to be
protective

JULIANNE
Let me rephrase that

KIMMY
But nothing ever could ever
did give me a moments pause
about this marriage

JULIANNE
Do you get hysterical in small
confined spa

KIMMY
» except one

Juliannes face Stops

JULIANNE
Oh yeah
Kimmy nods Confides
KIMMY
You
A stopper
KIMMY

Youll always be there In his
mind The perfect creature he
loved for all those y

JULIANNE
Well perfection can get wearing
after whi

KIMMY
Im not joking I had to face
up to all my competitive drives
and believe me Ive got em

JULIANNE
No

KIMMY
And the answer was so simple

JULIANNE
I was gonna predict that

KIMMY
You win

Julianne blinks Excuse me
KIMMY
Youre enshrined in his heart
and memory Unassailable
Which works out great

JULIANNE
Ive missed a step

KIMMY
He has you on a pedestal And
me in his arms

Oh Julianne smiles LUNGES for the EMERGENCY button YANKING it
so hard it comes OFF in her hand A terrifying BUZZER ensures

JULIANNE
Jesus were trapped

KIMMY
Ju

JULIANNE
No this happened to me once
almost it was excruciating

Begins BANGING random buttons out of control Kimmy watching
this Julianne looks WILDLY up

JULIANNE
Theres a panel up there you
could boost me

RIPPING off her platform shoes

JULIANNE
You know how little air is
in these things Ive seen
statistics Once youre trapped
between floors

Kimmy taps her Points to the lighted panel It says PH theyve
reached the Penthouse

JULIANNE
God Then the door is jammed

Takes a heavy platform and begins BANGING the metal door with all
her strength sending resounding BOOMS throughout the area as
Kimmy reaches and

» presses DOOR OPEN The metal doors part opening directly onto
the banquet room just as a mighty blow comes down and the platform
FLIES from Juliannes hand straight BETWEEN

two identical stunning YOUNG WOMEN serving as twin hostesses
for the shower A beat of mutually-stupefied looks and we hear
the shoe CRASH somewhere to a small spattering of SHRIEKS

MANDY
Mah Gawd its the bride
and the woman shell nevah

KIMMY (mutters to Julianne)
That would be us

SAMMY
Did she say th wrong thang
agin It is so in character

AMANDA and SAMANTHA NEWHOUSE 19-year-old twins True Southern
belles with the faces of angels and bodies made for hot oil
wrestling Mandys hair is dyed ash blonde Sammys is amber
Otherwise the experience is similar

JULIANNE
(thrusts out her hand)
Im Julianne Potter and

SAMMY

We came in complementary colors

MANDY
Have you sized up the groomsmen
Jules As M of H you get

short hairy rich one

JULIANNE
unless he has a hump

The girls cast identical blank looks at Kimberly

KIMMY (to the sluts)
Dry I told you

WOMANS VOICE (VO)
Is this Michaels Julianne

All eyes turn to an elegant woman of barely 40 She has her
daughters hair and eyes and slender form But the bearing rules
half an empire Fonda would envy

ISABELLE
Im Isabelle Wallace and my
handsome new son scarcely did
you justice girl

She takes both of Juliannes hands and our heroine is sort of
magically charmed As if touched by Glinda the Good Witch of the
North
ISABELLE
Now my husband says to scoot
you over to the ballpark so
you can hang with Michael But
first you have to meet a lot of
really old women

Looking warmly in her eyes
ISABELLE
That is if youve absorbed
enough profanity

Flicks a glance at the twins Leads Julianne off

MANDY (0OS pouting)
We sayed one fuck

INT TAXI SOUTH SIDE - DAY

Cab crawling toward COMISKEY PARK through stifling traffic
Julianne oblivious cellular to her ear

JULIANNE
Desperate measures Do you

SQUAWK Static Then

JULIANNE
I dont know hit men whoopee
cushions saltpeter something
The girl is impossibly impregnable
Even I want her to get the guy

Listens

JULIANNE
Tell him the what The truth

She shakes her head What a guy

JULIANNE
That desperate May I never get

INT LUXURY BOX COMISKEY PARK - AFTERNOON

Game in progress Watched by Michael three groomsmen his age two
middle-aged men and one bodyguard Suddenly a dull THUMPING at
the door It keeps up They finally all look over The bodyguard
gets the door revealing

JULIANNE
Which of you gents ordered

two beers

One single tray Holding fourteen beers Balancing on one hand
Michael JUMPS UP terrified at the impending mayhem this sight
suggests

MICHAEL
Wow Lemme give you a ha

JULIANNE (sweetly)
Michael Youll unwittingly
imply that Im clumsy

He stops in his tracks The guys whistle

MICHAEL
Think of that And as well as
I know you

She goes first to the bodyguard

BODYGUARD
Sorry maam Im on duty

JULIANNE (lovely smile)
Its Miss And thanks That
leaves two for me

Heads down the row

MICHAEL
Julianne Potter this is Hank
and Gerry from SI and you know
Daniel

Shes nodding flawlessly plucking two beers each from perimeter
of the tray keeping the rest perfectly balanced in the center
Michael is flat dumbstruck Next a tall patrician gentleman with
rolled-up sleeves on his hand-stitched silk shirt

MICHAEL
Oh This is my father-in-law
Walter

Once again she gracefully plucks two beers for the distinguished
father-in-law

MICHAEL
How are you doing this Youre
on drugs

Sets them down The man has a smile wonderful in its ease
Murmurs

WALTER
If he gives you grief Ill have
him skillfully beaten where the
wounds wont show

JULIANNE
I guess getting him whacked would
be politically out of the question

WALTER
Under the circumstances Charmed
to know you Jules

JULIANNE
Nice meeting you too Walt

A nod between equals She moves on

MICHAEL
And this guy you know

She sure does and effortlessly balancing her one-hand load she
dips to kiss a porky balding guy with big-time shoulders
Straight on the lips

JULIANNE
Papa Joe

They go way back He is uncomfortable at this rich mans wedding
even as gracious as everyone has been His watering eyes twinkle
at her and the voice has a trace of Boston

JOE
You gonna be my boys best man

Despite SHOUTS from the others

JULIANNE
Best everything Joe But Im
going to dance with you

MICHAEL
Dance You dont dance You
learn to dance

Her innocent smile

JULIANNE
Moves Youve never seen

BIG reaction from the guys as she heads toward Michael with the
last of the beers not looking down at the FIELDERS MITT which
lies right in her path and as his lips part to scream a warning
she skips

» neatly AROUND it Hes in shock
MICHAEL
Youre an impostor What have

you done with my best friend

As he takes away the remaining beers
MICHAEL
And how was the hot dog

Hot dog His eyes fix on her left breast HUGE mustard stain
She cant believe it

MICHAEL
Cheap and unnecessary We were
looking anyway

EXT LUXURY BOX ROOF - DAY

Michael and Julianne sit with their beers on the edge of the luxury
box roof The game the stadium spread out beneath them Yet
they are alone in the world She dangles her legs and we can hear
her kicking the glass below

JULIANNE
I just admire your maturity
thats all I mean there are
people who would find that kind of
perfection boring Day after day
year after year

MICHAEL
see thats what I thought at
first How can you like someone
that perfect No potential for
long-range livability

Drinking their beers Side by side Both stare only at the game

MICHAEL
Luckily The closer I watched
the more the fault came into
focus Each imperfection its own
adorable slice of vulnerability

JULIANNE
Such as

MICHAEL
Shes too genuine

JULIANNE
Hate that

MICHAEL
How can you trust someone you

can never mistrust

JULIANNE
Whats next

Keep sipping Never look at each other

MICHAEL
No matter how many times I
leave the toilet seat up she
forgets and puts it down

JULIANNE
Endearingly absent-minded

MICHAEL

My very point

Heres another one

Shakes his head This one really gets him

MICHAEL
Every day She makes the bed

JULIANNE
Quite the little eccentric

MICHAEL
At first I thought it was a
gag but shes always done it

This is not the ammunition Julianne was hoping for

JULIANNE
Is there a coup de grace in

here somewh

MICHAEL

She admires

Tommy Lasorda

JULIANNE
Waiter Check please

MICHAEL
She finds him personable

JULIANNE
Can that kind of defect be
passed on genetically

She looks over now And Michael is looking back
wonderful smile Her reaction shows that she thinks its for her

until

MICHAEL
Then again She has a few good

traits

Hating herself for asking

but seeing no way out

JULIANNE
Gimme like eight and nine off
the top ten list

MICHAEL
First girl I ever knew Who

Smiling the most
lets me give her a bath
The look in his eyes She can hardly bear it

MICHAEL
And when I hug her even in
public I dont have to let go
right away She lets me hold
her as long as I want

He seems so deeply in love

MICHAEL
Nice kid dont you think

A beat A slow nod A quiet

JULIANNE
Looks like from here

Slips her hand up onto his shoulder muscle Starts giving a little
massage

JULIANNE

seen She shrugs

JULIANNE
Still Alls fair in love and

Theyve reached the stairs to the El A rickety train RATTLES
above them As they start up she slips her arm around his

He slides his arm around her shoulder Pals They climb out of

INT HOTEL BATHROOM - LATE NIGHT

CLOSE on a shallow pool of water in a bathroom sink Green powder
pouring in a hand SWIRLING it around until

JULIANNE (0OS)
Its Albanian I think Or Mongolian
Or Canadian One of those I bought
it downstairs

» it becomes truly disgusting lumpy green mud

JULIANNE (0OS)
I figure what the hell Can it
make me look worse

Follow the hand up as it SLATHERS the shit across her face in great
green dripping gobs Shes juggling the wall phone trying to keep
it mudless as she assures Digger

JULIANNE

Dig of course Of course of

course of course of course I

have a plan Certainment

More green slime The Julianne we know disappears

JULIANNE

How I ask myself what would

Lucy Ricardo do in this situa

Desecrates three hotel towels wiping her hand

JULIANNE
Well one worked once

THROWS them in the bathtub Fastidiousness a short suit
JULIANNE
Ricky wouldnt let her in
the show

Reaches for her toothbrush absently All her attention is on the
conversation and the hideous green face in the mirror

JULIANNE
I recall it differently but
we digress

Without looking picks up a tube of hotel shampoo

JULIANNE
So in the version youre Ethel
with better fashion instincts

Squeezes it all over the toothbrush

JULIANNE
This puts you in charge of Plan B
the unprincipled and insanely
dangerous back-up plan

Lifts it toward her mouth liquid shampoo dripping from the
bristles

JULIANNE
In case simple lying doesnt work

At the last second She stops We dont know why because shes
still never looked at the brush

JULIANNE
Question What happens if you
brush your teeth with shampoo

Turns on the tap Tries to scrub the toothbrush clean and DROPS
the phone into the green swamp which SPATTERS all over her front
Euucch Shes stymied agitated circling the sink leaning down
to it

JULIANNE
HOLD ON IM COMING IN FOR YOU

She sets the toothbrush down in her toiletries kit Decides to
YANK on the phones cord and the receiver SPRINGS out BOPPING
her in the face Shes so filthy at this point she just wipes it
clean on her nightshirt Tells Digger

JULIANNE
You okay This is one of those
problem phones

Lifts the toothbrush and tube of paste from her kit
JULIANNE
Right Your role You know guys
from Sports Illustrated yes I
mean you can walk right in there
Squeezes on the paste lifts the brush to her mouth
JULIANNE
You could get access to letterhead
for example

JAMS it in her mouth brushing as

or even maybe their fax
Stops The funniest look on her face Down to the toothpaste
tube

JULIANNE
Probably am Forget I brought it

Points to some jade pins Kimmy wrinkles her nose

KIMMY
I mean he loves his job
JULIANNE
Bad games bad towns bad pay bad
flights bad hotels real bad food
Homeless rootless lonely maybe
your copy gets into one issue out
of four

Smiles

JULIANNE
Whats not to love

None of this is lost on Kimmy Shes wondered the same

KIMMY
But he always says

JULIANNE
whatever is manly and
independent

Kim nods slowly Way ahead of her

JULIANNE
Why would he trade that for
running say a big piece of
the PR at a powerful complex
challenging conglomerate like
your dads

Kim stares back A strange look
KIMMY
Thats just the sort of thing
my father and I discussed
Julianne just blinks Amazed
JULIANNE
Im not stupid Say how
about this

Pointing to tiny golden scissors in the novelty case Kim so
absorbed by the main topic she has to force herself to focus on

KIMMY
For the twins What in the
world is th

JULIANNE
Gold nose hair clippers

Points to the tiny hand-lettered sign Indeed Kimmy shrugs not

KIMMY
So you dont think Michaels

KIMMY
Gold dog collars They dont
have dogs

JULIANNE
Hello

Kim nods oh But cant keep her mind off

KIMMY
You think hed accept

Hmm

KIMMY
Michael A job like that

Oh well

JULIANNE
By any yardstick that involves
sanity it would be the greatest
thing that ever happened to him
Present company excepted

Kimmy nodding slowly Her yearing achingly apparent

JULIANNE
On the other hand hes proud
Last thing a man wants to admit
is being trapped in a dispiriting
dead-end job that can never
support a family

A very sweet smile

JULIANNE
Throw a man a life preserver
Hell say Thanks anyway
Id rather drown

Kim nods again Right They are so bonded at this moment

KIMMY
So one almost has to
JULIANNE
Exactly
KIMMY

Exactly what
JULIANNE
What you said Make it appear
that hes doing you the favor

Kimmy bites her lip Her eyes go down Self-conscious to admit

JULIANNE
I couldnt really do that
After you know

Her voice trails off

JULIANNE (kind but wise)
lying All the time

That brings the gray eyes up Julianne bats her dark ones

JULIANNE
Oh darling my pitiful desires
and ambitions are dirt beneath
the manly boots of your priorities

Kimmy has to smile small A self-awe gal

JULIANNE (pouring it on)
Two hundred seedy motels a year
Dinners out of vending machines
Waiting for you in vermin-infested
corridors of dark crotch-rot locker
rooms This stuff makes me hot

KIMMY
The very words Ive used

Julianne thinks it over Kimmy waits for guidance

JULIANNE
We make Dad your co-conspirator
Michael does a favor for Walter

Simple

JULIANNE
Walters reorganizing his public
relations needs a brilliant guy
whos close to him who he can
completely trust

Kimmy nodding Hope overriding reason

JULIANNE
So you beg Michael please do
this for Daddy please please
please blah blah blah its
only for six months it would
mean so much to me to help him out
Turns up her palms Viola

KIMMY
Hell see right through it

JULIANNE
Only If he wants to

They share a smile

JULIANNE
In six months hell be happy
settled successful

KIMMY
He wont get mad huh

MR MOONEY (OS)
May I be of any help whatsoever

Mr Mooney is the most gracious Brit salesperson ever to offer
kindness intelligence and thoughtfulness to a customer He is
large sixty with disappearing hair watering eyes and a manner
that makes you think of immediately hiring a butler

JULIANNE
Bridesmaid gifts for two well
assertive outspoken Tennessee
debutantes

KIMMY (still focused)
He wont be mad

JULIANNE (to Mooney)
Nothing here seems to quite capture
their distinctive personalities

MR MOONEY
Something customized perhaps
We can fashion most any item
from gold
Ah Julianne nodding Reflecting
MR MOONEY
An object that might represent

what is closest To their heart

KIMMY (under her breath)
Dont even think dildo

Julianne digs through her jumbled bag

JULIANNE
Could you do this

Tossing an object on the counter
JULIANNE
In 24 carat

It is a MASTERCARD A gold one

KIMMY (softly)
Bingo

They smile at each other More bonded than ever

KIMMY
You dont think hell be mad

A beat Can Julianne even make herself do this

JULIANNE
Your call You can live a lie
In a fabulous selection of Red
Roof Inns Or you can make one
desperate stab at hap

KIMMY
I just dont want to freak him
out

What do you think Julianne stares into the soft gray eyes Its
now or never The smile of a dear sister

JULIANNE
How mad could he get

INT FASHION RESTAURANT - LUNCH HOUR

Julianne enters with a really nervous Kimberly in tow Approaches
the maitre d We CLOSE to hear

MAITRE D
Oh Mr Wallace and his guests
have retired to the humidor

Points to an escalator leading to the mezzanine Behind a glass
wall what looks like a British mens club Thirty guys anda
billion cigars As Julianne starts toward it

MAITRE D
Oh Mademoiselle

She turns back Loves this shit

MAITRE D
Its unofficial of course But
traditionally the humidor is for
gentlemen only

JULIANNE
Great Ive got this girlfriend
at the Justice Department With
all this time on her hands

Her look is every bit as hard as his He gestures to the
escalator She takes Kimmys hand and up they go We can see
Walter in a big leather chair enjoying a major stogie Kimmy
licks her lips

They enter Every head turns A nice range of reactions from
offended to attracted and points in between

JULIANNE (murmurs)
Piece of cake Ill hang and
think happy thoughts

Kimmy nods Heads over toward her father Julianne walks
confidently even provocatively to the wall lined with bins of
cigars Every eye in the place is on her butt

She runs her fingers over a few contenders Plucks one out
examines it puts it back Walks a little farther Selects
another big and black Rolls it expertly in her fingers Sniffs
along its length

A guy comes over Could be 40 successful a brokers pin-stripe
Nearly as attractive as he thinks he is

GUY
Know what youre looking for
little lady

Little lady huh She glances at his coven of buddies who pretend
not to notice Then straight to the guys blue eyes

JULIANNE
Yeah Do you

GUY
I asked first

Ah Wit She holds up her cigar

JULIANNE
I like em long and hard Kind
of big around

Runs it under her nose

JULIANNE
Smell is important Im a believer
in that

Takes a match from a cut crystal bowl
JULIANNE

But you never know what youve
got Till you run your tongue
over it

And she does Moistening the full length of the cigar The boys
are laughing openly She STRIKES the match As she lights up

GUY
I meant What youre looking for
in a man

She glances at his wedding ring Then straight into his eyes

JULIANNE
Actually Im partial to married
gentlemen

The way she says that The guy swallows We can see some of the
air has been sucked from the room

GUY
Why is that

JULIANNE
Its so much time When I phone
the wives

Explosive LAUGHTER from the peanut gallery As she jams the big
Clemente Churchill into her mouth she sees Kimmy waving her over
from across the room Without even looking at the guy shes just
put away

she crosses the room Walter stands politely looking very
dapper very powerful and focusing on her with considerable
interest He waits until she sits on the edge of a costly leather
hassock

WALTER
(simply)
Your idea

She cant read this guy Maybe thats how he built an empire She
nods yeah

WALTER
Youre a woman of insight

He sits on the arm of his chair Close enough to speak quietly

WALTER
My wife and I love this marriage
and deplore its circumstances

He puffs his cigar Julianne puffs her Kimmy looks on a kid
watching the grown-ups

WALTER
As you guessed my daughter is
unhappy about giving up her life
And in my opinion cowardly in
avoiding the necessary confrontation

Then he stops As if reading Juliannes eyes

WALTER
Mike has a world of ability
Id do anything to have him in
my company

One more puff

WALTER
Except ask him

Julianne is a little stunned Kimmy looks helpless

WALTER
Hed resent it And me And
most important Kim

No smile on his lips Straight talk

WALTER
Hes a great kid but hes still
a kid Instead of recognizing
that his resistance comes from
insecurity hed turn it to anger
To protect himself

Spreads his hands

WALTER
from realizing that hes
ignoring my daughters needs
despite how very much he loves her

He looks to his daughter now

WALTER
They both have some growing up
to do But theyre good people
theyre starting with love
Theyve got time

JULIANNE
(softly)
I think youre making a mistake
sir

His eyes come back to her A little sharply

WALTER
And that interests me How
someone who knows him so well
could be so wrong
A formidable guy She meets his gaze

JULIANNE
See I love him too as much
as anyone here And fora
whole lot longer

From her heart

JULIANNE
I think I know best what would
make him happy

INT TOILET STALL - DAY

Julianne fully dressed sits on the closed lid of a toilet seat
The stall is tiny enough to arouse claustrophobia in an astronaut
Her cellular phone pressed to her ear she is listening angrily
smoking ferociously every call in her body running at red-line

JULIANNE
Okay okay okay okay I hear
you all right

She closes her eyes

JULIANNE
It is stupid dishonest desperate
beyond belief and cant possibly
ever work It can only end in
humiliation and disgrace Now can
I say two words

Deep drag on the cigarette For strength
JULIANNE
Do it Do it Do it Do it
Do it Do it

Shes striped her gears COUGHS horribly

JULIANNE
All right twelve words

INT PUBLIC RESTROOM - DAY

Julianne exits the stall To face three BLACK TEENAGE GIRLS Just
staring at her

TEENAGER
(supportive)

You do it girl

Julianne nods to the kids They nod back Damn straight She
exits the restroom into

glaring sunlight We are in the middle of the BROOKFIELD ZOO
And sitting on a bench eating popcorn from a bag

MICHAEL
Wow What was going on in
there
She shudders
JULIANNE

Some crazy person

EXT ZOO - DAY

Michael and Julianne walking together Hes eating his popcorn
She carries a cardboard container with nachos a gooey fudge waffle
cone and a large drink

MICHAEL
Youre not eating

JULIANNE
I never eat when Im serene

MICHAEL
You never eat when youre
despondent

JULIANNE

I switched that around when you
werent looking

She swirls a single nacho chip in cheese But her heart isnt in it
MICHAEL
Last zoo we were in was
Beijing yeah Sure The rhinos

were fucking

JULIANNE
Boy those were the days

And when she looks over His eyes are waiting
MICHAEL
(softly)
Yeah they were
Theyre passing the hippo pen But they dont notice
JULIANNE
That was nice The way you

said that

So was that Hes feeling restless something Doesnt know quite
what to say

MICHAEL
Its weird being the groom All
these things Kimmy has to take
care of

JULIANNE
You need a baby-sitter Thats
what Im here for

He holds her eyes Then looks down Awkward And the way hes
doing it begins to excite her

JULIANNE
Say it

He looks up neither one of them noticing that as they walk she is
about to

CRASH into a chest-high metal stand that displays animal facts
We have followed him as she is WIPED from frame His face from
shock to amusement

MICHAEL
Now theres my girl

to tenderness PAN back to see her wearing everything from her
cardboard container Nachos fudge sauce Diet Coke the works

It is really awful Kids bystanders laughing cruelly Her eyes
fill with tears and she tries bravely to smile against it

JULIANNE
See I can only do it with
beer

He takes out his handkerchief And with that and his hands gently
scoops the worst of the mess off her The fact that hes touching
her breasts and her body is something they pretend not to notice
She laughs softly and a few tears fall even though she doesnt
know why Such an odd raw confusing moment To the world
looking on they are lovers

MICHAEL
(murmurs)
See better already

And he kisses her face Not quite her lips But only an inch away
We can feel her heart pounding He strips off his shirt only a tank
top underneath

MICHAEL
Well go back to the bathroom
youll put this on

Okay She sniffles okay Swallows
JULIANNE

Bet youre glad Im here to
take care of you
He puts his arm around her

MICHAEL
Bet I am

Holds her close as they start toward the restroom

MICHAEL
Hope that crazy persons not
still there

Were on their backs

JULIANNE (0OS)
She doesnt scare me

EXT BEACH CLUB LAKE MICHIGAN - SUNSET

Julianne in T-shirt and shorts rushes onto the deck of a sprawling
beach club Clutching her bag she quickly surveys the scene

the entire beach has been taken over by the wedding party
Young folks old folks little kids maybe 200 people We SCAN
with her to find a crowd around

a three-on-three volleyball game Kimmy and two groomsmen on
one side facing Michael and the Tennessee debs The twins wear
spectacular bikinis and are surprisingly athletic as well as
predictably uninhabited As the next point begins Kimmy serves

Sammy in back makes a nice dig lobbing to Mandy who sets for
Michaels vicious SPIKE straight THROUGH his best mans hapless
defense The crowd cheers Michael and as he turns Mandy gives
him a savage

CHEST BUMP of congratulation that any NFL linebacker would be
proud of It puts the surprised Michael straight on his butt
Laughter applause The twins pull him up and Sammy gives hima
hot kiss on his ear that makes the crowd react Kim plays good
sport Julianne watches Michaels body for a beat then

dashes off Down the beach several barbecue grills have been
set up Manned by beach club staff and family alike Michaels
pop Joe is dispensing beers from a keg Kims mom Isabelle is
coordinating the beans potato salad and corn-on-the-cob table
Julianne races across the sand to

» a huge smoky grill where Walter is basting baby back ribs
clearly enjoying himself Julianne runs up to him says something
into his ear He looks at her Then turns his station over to a
club steward and follows Julianne down toward the lakeside

CLOSE now As they stroll together shes a little breathless
Hes watching her profile curious silent At the waters edge

JULIANNE
(whispers)
Is anybody watching

WALTER
I hope so This is all too
mysterious to waste on just me

She reaches into her big bag Pulls out a single folded sheet of
paper

JULIANNE
I picked up Michaels messages
for him at our hotel I stole
one

His face darkens The easy smile fades He holds up his palms

WALTER
Julianne reading my son-in-laws
mail is not something

JULIANNE
Sir this is important Havent
you ever in your life cut one
corner to make something important
turn out right

His smile returns Just a little

WALTER
Matter of fact thats how I got
married

The look holds She thrusts the paper out He still doesnt take
it

JULIANNE
Its a fax from Sports Illustrated
from Ben Isaacson Michaels boss

WALTER
(quickly)
I know Ben

She opens the paper

JULIANNE
Mike We still have no answer to
our E-mail of Wednesday Which
option do you select I dont mean
to rush you but Personnel needs to
tie up the loose ends

He takes the paper We see it now Looks authentic

JULIANNE
I think hes been fired
WALTER
It doesnt say th

JULIANNE
Hes said some things over the
past few weeks Look this is why
I came up with the idea of you
offering him a job

He looks up Hes listening Closely

JULIANNE
And why I couldnt say anything
before in front of Kim

She bites her lip Seems so earnest

JULIANNE
I just think of how desperate
he must be feeling Hes marrying
a rich mans daughter and hes
about to become destitute You
know the kind of job market hell
be facing

He does
WALTER
And you think hes kept this to
himself
JULIANNE

Hes too proud to beg for help

And if you wait till this comes out
your offer will be like charity
Completely humiliating

Hes staring at her But his mind is working behind his eyes

JULIANNE
If you do it now its like hes
helping you He can accept with
dignity

He taps the paper with the back of his knuckles

WALTER
This fax could mean any number
of things

She nods She knows that
WALTER

(softly)
Maybe I should call Ben
JULIANNE
Then it could all come out sooner
or later Nobody should be in on
this Just you and me Or more
correctly I

She takes the paper back
JULIANNE
What if what if I could find
that E-mail
The long straight look Maybe hes hooked
JULIANNE
I never noticed Kimmy has your
eyes

INT LOBBY RITZ CARLTON HOTEL - TWILIGHT

Tall gangly young DESK CLERK Lank hair pimples He looks up
beams to see

JULIANNE

helping another guest across the way

JULIANNE

INT HOTEL CORRIDOR - TWILIGHT

An elevator OPENS revealing Julianne carrying a gym bag She
looks down the long hallway sees a maids cart Heads the other
way briskly to

» a small ALCOVE Opens the gym bag pulling out a bath towel
Begins to yank her top up OVER her head

ANGLE the young MAID now pushing her cart down the hall wheels
SQUEAKING and from nowhere

Julianne DARTS into her path barely covered by the towel held
tight across her she is grinning blushing

JULIANNE
Help me

The maid can only blink

JULIANNE
I locked myself out 1526 please

And looks frantically up the hall mortified that any moment a
stranger could happen upon her predicament Her eyes dart back to
the maid PLEASE The maid just stares Stares

JULIANNE
Uno-cinco-does-ses

Oh

INT MICHAELS ROOM - TWILIGHT

Julianne alone in his room looking around frantically No worries
about this guy making his bed every day stuff clothes strewn
everywhere the bathroom looks like a cherry bomb just detonated
Shes tramping through a bachelors debris wearing only her towel

looking looking

There it is The corner of his LAPTOP sticking out from beneath a
discarded bedspread She SNATCHES it up OPENS it sets it on the
cluttered desk and

stops There are wallet-sized SNAPSHOTS of Kimmy Some alone
Some as a little girl Some with Michael And next to them

the plastic fold-out wallet inset That he has not yet quite
rearranged So she picks it up Leafs through until she finds
what she was praying would be there

» Julianne grinning Michaels arm around her On the deck of a
boat They have drinks in their hands Happiness in their eyes

And she stares at it Jesus God how long has he carried this
around She flips through further all the rest have her in them
Maybe half a dozen Her heart is throbbing Her eyes are damp

Back to the one on the boat She slips it from the plastic window
Holds it Then gently

puts it back where it belongs PUNCHES up the goddamn laptop
This is it girl Do or die

JULIANNE
(murmurs)
You wouldnt change your
password would you You

where nearby the soft CLICKING of keys We PULL BACK to see

a small clubby room Books leather polished woods Only
two people here Walter looking on stony-faced as a determined
Julianne grimly struggles to find what shes looking for in
Michaels laptop And then
She stops typing Looks at the text on the screen Her eyes
sharpen as she reads what Walter cant see Its an Oscar
performance for our desperate girl She turns the screen around

WALTER
(reads)
Mike I hate this downsizing

He reads Reads Reads All the air comes out of him
WALTER
(softly)
And Kimmy doesnt know
She shakes her head Nope No way
WALTER

She forces up a fleeting smile of gratitude But Walter isnt
smiling at all

INTJULIANNES HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Julianne in her nightshirt her back to us sobbing into her
cellular as she paces the room

JULIANNE

counted on I never heard of

We CLOSE as she WHIPS around startling us with her grotesque day-
glo PURPLE face mask The green was better
JULIANNE
I mean the little twerp
GROVELED

Losing it We know the drill

JULIANNE
SHE IS SO WRONG FOR HIM

Clutching the phone

JULIANNE
Michael and I are the same person
Self-absorbed and imperfect and
vaguely loveable We deserve
each other

Tears are flowing Which over this mask is not a pretty sight

JULIANNE
Im out of hope Im out of sneaky
ideas Im at the end of my
rapidly-fraying hysterical little
rope Help m

She TRIPS over an open suitcase and DISAPPEARS from frame The
THUD is slightly alarming

JULIANNE (0S)
God I hate this hotel

HOLD On nothing is particular

JULIANNE (0OS)
And I hate talking to your machine

INT JULIANNES ROOM - EARLY MORNING

REAR VIEW of Julianne asleep on the floor sunlight streaming in
A soft knocking on a door somewhere nearby She barely stirs
The knock becomes a strong RAPPING and she fights for conscious-
ness Her back still to us she

vises STUMBLES to the door which is now pulsing with an
insistent POUNDING and THROWS it OPEN as we SNAP to

REVERSE ANGLE CLOSE on Juliannes face still encased in a now-
decomposing PURPLE MASK her eyes SPRINGING wide she SCREAMS in
shock and we SNAP BACK to

ORIGINAL ANGLE Digger watching impassively at the high-strung
SHRIEK In the silence that follows

DIGGER
You stole my line
He touches his face and she realizes

JULIANNE
Oh shit

Starts CLAWING at the overripe mask but he grabs her wrists
DIGGER

Chill We dont want your face
coming off with it

JULIANNE
Chill Since when do you say
ch

DIGGER

When Im talking to children
She looks in his eyes Realizing at last

JULIANNE
You flew all the way h

DIGGER
I noticed Im on the noon back
We have this thing with Georges
family in the Hamptons

JULIANNE
(soft)
Youre butting in

He still holds her wrists She brings one of his hands to her
lips Kisses his knuckles

JULIANNE
(softer)
I really resent this

INT BATHROOM - MORNING

Julianne seated at the sink staring into the mirror as Digger
gently applies soup cloth and water to easing away the mask A
paleontologist restoring a Bronze Age artifact By the side of the
half-filled sink rests her plugged-in curling iron

JULIANNE
What I mean when I say annoyingly
perfect is that there is nothing
annoying about her perfection
It is vulnerable and endearing
And that is annoying as shit

DIGGER
You like her

JULIANNE
If I didnt have to hate her Id
adore her

She looks up at him and WINCES as the movement makes him scrape
her face Hes sorry

JULIANNE
Last night she was crying these
big real tears when she thought
shed lost him It was like there
was a knife in her heart

Looking in his eyes Needs him to hear

JULIANNE
and I put it there I hated
myself I grieved for her I
couldnt enjoy one second of it
And then when it didnt work

Can you believe this

JULIANNE
I was devastated

DIGGER
(softly)
Go figure you

JULIANNE
Because I realized When I see
him say I do that knife will
be in my heart And it will be
there every

She holds his wrists now To stop him To plead for
understanding Forgiveness

JULIANNE
every time I think of him
forever which could be a lot

She almost choked on that last part So she composes herself

JULIANNE
You watch a guy caress his
girlfriends butt You see an
Old Spice commercial Sentimental
moments are everywhere when
youre in the right frame of mind

She swallows hard Fights for a grip on her determination
JULIANNE

There are 18250 nights in the
next 50 years
DIGGER
Youve been working on this huh

JULIANNE
» and having done the right
thing will only really be
comforting oh maybe five
six times

She sets her jaw

JULIANNE
This is my whole lifes happiness
I have to be ruthless

DIGGER
(quietly)
And you believe that

JULIANNE
(unconvincing)
Sure

His eyes are gentle and merciless at once No way she gets off
this hook

JULIANNE
He was in love with me every day
for nine years I can make him

happier than she can

DIGGER
Its not his happiness youre
feeling guilty about

JULIANNE
(proudly)
I dont know the meaning of the
word guilt

DIGGER
Impressive

JULIANNE
I am breaking her heart in the short
run but doing her a gigantic favor
She would be miserable tagging
along after this insensitive doofus

DIGGER
The man you love

JULIANNE
Beyond reason The feminist
warrior will rise up in this kid
and shell be standing over his
sleeping form with a butcher
knife selecting from a short
list of body parts

DIGGER
Someday shell thank you

JULIANNE
Lets not get carried away

And the defenses drain from her clay-ravaged features The real
Julianne is glimpsed

JULIANNE
Id settle for Someday Ill
forgive myself

For

JULIANNE
For doing this terrible thing

Her eyes tear up

JULIANNE
Which by the way I cant
figure out how to do

As the tears fall he wipes at them discovering

DIGGER
Jesus Youre supposed to take
your make-up off before you
apply the m

JULIANNE
I KNOW THAT I WAS DISTRACTED BY
GRIEF

A hint The first word is
Preparation Then comes a
letter of the alphabet
perilously close to G

She reaches to test her curling iron BURNS her finger SHIT
KNOCKING the appliance into the half-filled sink She LUNGES for
it and a terrified Digger GRASPS her arm

DIGGER
Considering the circumstances
Im not wholly against suicide
Huh
DIGGER
Just not by electrocution in
front of me

Oh

DIGGER
Ive got this noon flight

He reaches to pull the plug from the wall and now she LUNGES to
grab his arm slipping her face falling forward stopping an inch

above the sink

JULIANNE
How do you know you can touch
that plug Are you a licensed
contractor

DIGGER
What do you suggest

She looks from the plug down the cord to the submerged curling
iron And back

JULIANNE
Maybe they just seal off this
room They have others

Hes staring at her Sweet but intense

DIGGER
I didnt mean about that

Oh Again

JULIANNE
If I hear the words tell the
truth or any paraphrase thereof
I dive into the sink and pull you
with me

Looking at her Looking at her

disgusting sounds her feet FLAILING in mid-air He laughs as he
pulls her back down to the deck Of course it was all a joke He

brushes back her hair Sighs Stares

JULIANNE
(casual)

JULIANNE
Well Theres a lot of memories
to choose from

MICHAEL
Its more than that

That tightens her throat pretty good When she tries to speak out
comes a dry CROAK that makes him laugh again Softer this time

MICHAEL
I mean its embarrassing to
say it this way but

He stops Her eyes WIDEN in a burlesque of anticipation So he
smiles She knows how to put him at ease

MICHAEL
Youve sort of been yknow
the woman in my life

JULIANNE
(straight back)
Youve been the man in mine

Passing under the Michigan Avenue Bridge No one knows quite what
to say

MICHAEL
And I was thinking this could be
our last time Alone Together
You know

JULIANNE
Except for the hot affairs well

MICHAEL
Except for that

Shes smiling so easily Who would guess her stomach is double-
knotted

MICHAEL
I can hardly wait for your

She watches his surprise
MICHAEL
Boy I never thought Id hear you

say that Can I come

She holds herself together Real soft with
JULIANNE
I couldnt have it without you

Hes glad to hear that And then

MICHAEL
Its normal to have second
thoughts huh To be scared

Is this a change of direction Or is it the direction shes been
praying for

JULIANNE
I wouldnt know I never had
that many first thoughts

MICHAEL
I mean you commit to a wedding
And then it seems like this
momentum you know You forget
you chose it
She nods Understands
MICHAEL

You and I I mean in all our
relationships with other people
We didnt use the word love

We didnt
MICHAEL
Kimmy says When you love someone
You say it you say it out loud
Right now Or the moment
Long beat

MICHAEL
passes you by yeah Shes a
smart girl

Off in distance the Centennial Fountain SHOOTS an eight-foot JET
of water across the river For Michael and Julianne it goes
unnoticed

MICHAEL
We dont have a song

Hmm
MICHAEL
Kimmy and I We dont have a song

Is that a bad sign

All Julianne can do is shrug Then
MICHAEL
(sings softly)
Someday when Im awfully low
And the world is cold
She doesnt want to cry So she puts all the strength she has into
fighting it back

MICHAEL
(sings)
I will feel a glow just Thinking of you
And the way you look Tonight

He stops Smiles that sweet boyish smile

MICHAEL
Dance card filled

JULIANNE
Ill check I have it on
powerbook these days

He holds up his arms And she moves into them He begins to dance

with her turning so slowly And yes people are watching

MICHAEL
(sings in her ear)
With each word your tenderness grows
Tearing my fears apart

She holds him closer Bites her lip

MICHAEL
(sings)
And that laugh
That wrinkles your nose
Touches my foolish heart

He stops He looks at her Shes still in his arms

MICHAEL
Where did we first hear th

JULIANNE
(straight back)
The night we met

Right to his eyes

JULIANNE
The night we fell in love

He doesnt know what to do with that

MICHAEL
So we heard it like right
that that first

JULIANNE
We danced to it Just like this

Just like this A long beat And he has to say

MICHAEL
I wont lose you will I

Her eyes close Then open Utterly lost in his

JULIANNE
No Because I wont let you

INT WALLACE ENTERPRISES - DAY

Julianne in crisp chalk-stripe trousers and a buttoned-up dress
shirt Her coat slung over her shoulder she wanders through
the Saturday-deserted office space Desks cubicles monitors
silent A row of executive offices standing empty waiting for
the custodian Turning a corner we hear

life at the end of the hallway A grand conference room with a
glass wall Walter in shirtsleeves running a strategy meeting

for five DEIDRE his personal secretary clicking every word into
her laptop at warp speed Walter sees Julianne through the glass

A comic take of pleased surprise He comes out to greet her

WALTER
I thought Michael was picking
me up

JULIANNE

I told him get the important
stuff Kims ring Ill collect
the inconsequentials
Meaning you They smile at each other Then
WALTER
Kim said when he turned down

Julianne thinks back

JULIANNE
Friction No

He smiles at her line reading But his mind is always probing

WALTER

JULIANNE

Nobody has So far
Her bright grin His eyes linger on it

WALTER
Well youre a little early

JULIANNE
I need to make some calls
Could I use your office

INT WALTERS OFFICE - DAY

Julianne enters the spacious corner office high above the city
Closes the door quietly behind her So anxious she is
practically hyperventilating She goes slowly to the vacant
cherrywood desk Its computer and monitor standing silent She
is stalking it like a deadly animal And then She is there

Talking to herself her own desperate support network

JULIANNE
(softly)
You can do this

Sacred filled with doubt and conflict Her hands clutch at each
other Then one flicks out And the computer goes ON The
screen GLOWS Waits for her Her mouth is sand her stomach
water She pulls the paper from her pocket

looks at it Looks to the monitor And begins To type
JULIANNE
(mumbling to herself
E-mail address To Ben Isaacson
Senior Editor Sports Illustrated
from Walter Wallace

And stops Her heart is thumping

JULIANNE
See you can do it Its easy

Doesnt look easy Licks her lips
JULIANNE
You do it fast its over Like
it never happened

She sits And recites as she types

JULIANNE
Ben I need a favor

Here we go This is it Types

JULIANNE
My daughters every happiness
And my wifes And least of
all my own are in your hands

Nods okay Breathing hard Types

JULIANNE

JULIANNE
I have offered Mike ONeal my
new son-in-law a great opportunity
in my company This would also
enable my daughter to settle in
Chicago near us and pursue her
dreams and plans

Almost there Almost Types

JULIANNE
To his own detriment as well
as ours Michael will not accept
our offer While he works for you

She stands up Stares at the screen Walks away Walks back
Still standing types

JULIANNE
My daughter joins me in this
plea for your cooperation and
discretion

Is there a SOUND Outside the door She HOVERS over the ESCAPE
key Waits Waits Silence Types

JULIANNE
With gratitude For your
understanding Walter

She hits a KEY The screen goes BLANK The computer asks DO
YOU WISH TO SEND She tells the computer

JULIANNE
Are you crazy Get him fired

Types NO The computer asks HOLD FOR LATER And she types YES
JULIANNE
Just till tonight when I bring

him back To look for

She glances to her huge bag Rummages through pulling out a manila
folder Lays it by the blank computer Fans out a few pages in a
natural disorderly way Takes a step back
And stares Struck to her gut But when she has done
INT CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

Walter alone with Deidre now signing a stack of documents as she
efficiently places one after another before him When he glances up
he sees Julianne wandering the halls Stands tells his secretary

WALTER

Off to rehearsal Send out this

Slips on his coat Oh and by the way

WALTER

On his way through the door

WALTER

INT CHAPEL UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO - DAY

Julianne and Walter enter the rear of a striking Gothic CHAPEL
pastel light slanting in through stained glass windows We now
see the full effect of her outfit a mans-style chalk stripe SUIT
tailored to fit her body set off by a bold silk tie Solid
dynamite She hangs back while Walter proceeds down the vaulted
nave toward

Michael Kimmy Isabelle and Joe who stand casually joking by
the altar Scattered around are assorted groomsmen ushers an
obvious flowergirl Coming toward us up the aisle

the MINISTER early 40s lean and quite attractive Mandy is
HANGING on his arm pressing her body against him as they walk
murmuring urgent murmurs close to his ear Hes a really good
sport and really uncomfortable Sammy is walking backwards

right in front of them DROPS her bag and BENDS to retrieve it as
if oblivious to major cleavage on immediate display

Julianne is so lost in her own anxiety she doesnt even notice
until

MANDY
Reverend Dyer this is
Kimberlys somewhat butch
maid of honor

SAMMY
Mr Julianne Potter
prominent New York drag queen

Today the girls voices are charmingly musically Southern with
none of the extreme accents we heard at the shower The minister
extends his hand

MINISTER
Billy Dyer Julianne And I
love the suit

She shakes his hand smiles graciously but her eyes flick to
Michael now approaching up the aisle The girls lead the minister
away Michael arrives Looks her up and down

MICHAEL
(softly)
Takes me back

JULIANNE
Well

She smiles One that glows a little

JULIANNE
You sang the song Least I
could do was wear the outfit

He nods

MICHAEL
Except now youre better-
looking

Oh yeah Yes maam As she loses herself in his eyes

MICHAEL

He pulls the box from his pocket Somewhere an ORGAN sounds And
as he is about to hand her the box

MANDY SAMMY

simply impatient She wants his attention

JULIANNE

She takes the box from his hand Opens it as the singing CONTINUES
throughout The ring is delicate hammered gold One of a kind

MICHAEL

JULIANNE
(whisper)
Yes

Shes staring at the ring

KIMMY (OS)

INT CRAB HOUSE - NIGHT
CLOSE on a bowl filled with squares of butter HEAR the butt of
conversation from a rowdy friendly joint Juliannes right hand
REACHES to the bowl fingers trace the rim innocently then

SLIDE the bowl into Juliannes lap beneath the table Her right
hand MASSAGES all the butter into a gooey revolving mess We can
pick out familiar voices now family in distance the twins closer
As hidden from view Julianne brings

her left hand from her pocket Yep The ring is still there
The finger already red and swollen from pacicky efforts to pull it
off And as APPLAUSE surrounds us Julianne

PLUNGES her ring finger into the morass of grease frantically
TEARING at the ring butter SPLURGING on her pants everywhere as
we PULL BACK to see

the long table covered with butcher paper the family at the far
end the twins down here with us a mug of beer for each place as
team of waiters with heaping platters of CRABS which they

FLING across the butcher paper as APPLAUSE continues from
everyone but Julianne who still struggles secretly As the waiters
set huge wooden MALLETS in front of each guest Joe ONeal rises
POUNDS the table with his mallet for attention

JOE
Like to welcome everbody to
our little rehearsal supper

He COUGHS unaccustomed to public speaking Walter and Isabelle
clap and call out support So Joe lifts his mallet

JOE
Okay everyone stand up

And everyone does With one exception Trapped She JAMS her
left hand in her coat pocket SMEARS her right palm sort of clean
on the underside of the table GRABS her mallet and JUMPS UP

JOE
To the bride uh goes the
honor of cracking the first

crab

Everyone applauses by banging their mallets Joe RAISES his high
Everybody imitates

KIMMY
But first a toast

And everybody SNATCHES up their beers with their left hands as
Julianne DROPS her mallet with a HORRIFIC CRASH grabbing her beer
looking up to

JULIANNE
(on the spot)
Im right-handed

A hugely embarrassing half-second Bailed out by

KIMMY
To our host my cuddly Papa
Joe
All turns
KIMMY
Who taught me to play Blue
Hawaii On my nose

With a look at Julianne Kim sets down her mallet gently and
performs a nasal HUM of the tropical standard strikingly her nostril
repeatedly for vibrato It is charming and everybody watches

INT HOTEL BALLROOM - LATER

CLOSE on an actual living if geriatric LION He blinks from his
cage bored as hell HEAR the surrounding noise chatter LOUD
Sinatra music of a very large party PULL BACK to see

» and overdecorated BALLROOM in dim and dramatic lighting
dripping with the trappings of ANCIENT ROME The mingling guests
are the neatly one hundred females of the wedding party most of
them older women They are served by wandering well-built ATHLETES
in Roman togas or gladiator costumes PAN TO

» Julianne still in her suit hiding by a table piled with a
carload of grapes Her left hand still buried in her pocket The
eyes of a hunted animal From nowhere

MANDYSAMMY (0S)

back into its pocket The girls have snuck up behind her They
have changed into hot gowns that are really only wide ribbons
wrapped around their bodies

MICHAEL

minute

He looks more sick than angry As if the heart has just been cut
out of him She doesnt know what to say or do so she just stands
staring dumbly

MICHAEL
Please

She nods stumbles out of her room closing the door behind her
Now shes in the empty corridor clutching her big jumbled bag
sinking down to sit on the carpet her back against the door

She doesnt look elated She seems frightened distraught and
most of all confused Because she cant understand why She digs
absently through her bag Cigarettes Box of matches

She lights up Draws deeply Somehow she seems near tears and
laughs bitterly at that Shakes her head at how fucked-up she finds
herself Squeaking wheels approach but she is too lost to hear them

BELLMAN
Miss are you locked out
or something

She looks up A small wiry man of nearly 60 in a slightly faded
but neatly-kept uniform On his cart a ton of bags

JULIANNE
No I just stepped out because
its a non-smoking room

And inhales deeply Leans back against the door to look up at him
more comfortably
BELLMAN
(politely)
Well its non-smoking floor

person I do bad things to
honest people This see this
smoking Tip of the iceberg

Waves her hand

She squints at his nameplate

JULIANNE
Do you smoke Richard

BELLMAN
Yes maam I do but its

JULIANNE
a non-smoking floor yeah
Well you know what

And she takes the cigarette from her lips Turns it around holds
it out to him Go ahead He doesnt move Please And so

he reaches down takes the cigarette from her hand Staring in
her eyes he takes a deep drag Savors an expert nostril-inhale of
his exhaled smoke Hands the cigarette back to her

BELLMAN
My grandmother always said
This too shall pass
She swallows Wipes at her eyes Finds a smile

JULIANNE
Thanks Richard If you werent
on duty Id buy you a drink

He just nods She waves He waves back pushes his cart down the
hall As she watches him go the door behind her suddenly OPENS
and she

FALLS through it flat on her back at Michaels feet Staring up
at him seeing that he looks as bad as she feels she takes raw deep
drag

JULIANNE
What happened

MICHAEL
(softly)
Its over

And crouches down Close beside her The cigarette drops from her
hand unnoticed on the carpet So he lifts it crushes it on the
heel of his shoe

MICHAEL
I want you to quit this shit

She just nods obediently Okay I will
MICHAEL
She denied it Said I was crazy

and paranoid

JULIANNE
A bad combination

He tries to smile Its really hard
MICHAEL

He lets the air out Slow So he wont cry
MICHAEL
She said How can I call everything

Shakes his head Can you imagine that

MICHAEL
The job thing would have broken
us up eventually anyway She

Julianne nods Maybe that part is right Maybe it would have

ended anyway Maybe she can pretend shes not a monster

MICHAEL
And shes right Im crazy to
fall for someone I hardly

Looks deep in her eyes Hes so glad shes there

MICHAEL
Hey You still got that ring

She holds up her left hand the flapping sleeve falls away
ring is on a finger that is swollen and raw

JULIANNE
I tried it on But it wont
come off

The

He smiles at that A sad smile of friendship Then takes her

finger gently

into his mouth It is something like a kiss And when he

removes her moistened finger
he pulls the ring OFF Nothing to it She blinks

JULIANNE
Its mental you know

He doesnt understand that
JULIANNE

Should we take a walk Or

MICHAEL
Or well go somewhere If you

They smiles at each other For real

JULIANNE

Imagine that The look holds Just above a whisper

MICHAEL

And then hes gone
INJULIANNES BATHROOM - LATE NIGHT
Julianne brushing out her hair in the bathroom mirror eyeing her

image with evident dissatisfaction as she listens to the receiver
RINGING

DIGGER (VO MACHINE)
Digger and George are with
family in the Hamptons until
Monday morning Brevity is even
more in order than usual

BEEP

JULIANNE
Hey handsome Brevity this

Her eyes find the pack of cigarettes Next to her toiletries kit
JULIANNE
(softly)

I won

Her fingers touch the pack As if an object of significance Takes
it up

JULIANNE
Amazing huh I didnt do things
quite your way But I got it

down
Cradling the phone against her shoulder she carefully tears the
of the pack completely open

JULIANNE
And forty years and nine grand-
children later when I sit with
Michael on some rustic porch
slogging through our sweet swamp
of nostalgic memories

Reaches the pack toward the toilet

JULIANNE
No one is going to sweet the
details

Turns it upside down emptying a dozen cigarettes into the john

JULIANNE
Of one weekend in Chicago

Drops the lid with a CLATTER Hits the FLUSH

JULIANNE
Talk about celebration

She lifts a tube from her toiletries kit Stares at it real
close

JULIANNE
Im gonna brush my teeth with
actual toothpaste

Turns it over reads all the writing Yep

JULIANNE
I guess Im too exhausted to
feel the elation I so richly
undeserve

Squeezes some paste onto her brush Carefully

JULIANNE
So Im gonna hold calls at the
desk while I get my

Start brushing

JULIANNE
(around her mouthful)
God it is toothpaste they
should sell this stuff
commercially Anyway a girl

Squints at her image Laughs spewing a little foam

top
JULIANNE

worrying about beauty sleep
Lets just settle for not
frightening small animals

She SPITS Tells Diggers machine

JULIANNE
Anyway I couldnt have done
it without you Even though I
did if you follow that

Wipes her mouth Stares off The eyes a little dreamy

JULIANNE
Three words Happily Ever
Well you know

SMASH CUT TO
INT BEDROOM - MORNING

Julianne sprawled all over the bed mouth open like a carp
sleeping mask against the daylight A sudden RAPPING at the
door and she

Sits BOLT UPRIGHT Utterly disoriented until she pulls off
the mask Stumbles out of bed walking toward the firm KNOCKING
when

it stops A message slip SLIDES beneath her door She lifts
it barely conscious This wakes her up In one

JULIANNE
(to the slip)
Youre going where

EXT WALLACE ESTATE - DAY

Julianne climbs from her taxi Only slightly in awe she sets off
past the reflecting pool which fronts a mansion of graceful stone
and timber Its a hike today because the circular drives is
clogged deep with Bentleys Mercedes and waiting limos vying for
space with a score of delivery vehicles of all kinds maintenance
trucks catering and florist and food vans

INT GREAT ROOM - DAY

Julianne escorted into an enormous room where brunch is in
progress for more than a hundred She looks from the vaulted
ceilings to the frescoed walls the inlaid floors the massive
pipe organ above the stone staircase the oil portraits of Scottish
ancestors and their favorite dogs

Isabelle has risen from the main table and comes to her All
smiles Julianne is in the Twilight Zone What are these people
laughing about Do they still think theres a wedding

ISABELLE
Jules Were so glad you
slept in

Takes her arm graciously This woman would make Anne Bancroft look
coarse As they walk

ISABELLE
Now you have a choice The idea
is bride and groom shouldnt see
each other on the magic day

Julianne looking all around Magic day it seems to be Where the
bell is a bride or a groom

ISABELLE
So Michael stays put in the garden
Kimmy stays in here

Pointing THERE she is obscured by a cluster of the appropriately
fawning She has the same hunted eyes and false slightly manic
smile Julianne wore yesterday This at least makes sense

ISABELLE (0OS)
and the guests go back and
forth Where will you start

CLOSE on Julianne Watching the brave frightened bride

JULIANNE
She looks tense

ISABELLE
(OS calmly)
Nerves I would never have
guessed

EXT ROSE GARDEN - DAAY

A steward leads Julianne to the edge of an expansive rose garden
altogether elegant and comfortable with its long white picnic
tables where nearly a hundred guests casually dine served by
rolling carts

There at the head table Michael staring at us He looks like a
poor attempt to cover a hard night She locks onto his eyes What
the hell is going on He looks helpless miserable She gestures
with her head follow me Stalks off

EXT SCULPTURE GARDEN - DAY
Bronze abstract pieces some quite large face a huge set of

childrens swings regulation playground size Julianne sits in
one moving slightly back and forth Trying to hold on to her
temper and her sanity

In the distance

where crews

circus has come to town When she looks back

Michael approaches Before he can draw a breath

JULIANNE
I had the craziest dream last
night Walter and Kimmy had
asked your boss to

MICHAEL
Look I came down here to face
everybody I didnt want to
slink away like some coward

JULIANNE
But the Scotch salmon was so
fucking good you decided to
stay for brunch

MICHAEL
She hasnt told anybody what

She comes OFF the swing PUSHES him back two feet

He swallows

are setting up tents lights heaters for tonight

The
MICHAEL
Hey This is a serious matter

Thank you She POKES his chest punctuating

JULIANNE
Ill be right back

INT KITCHEN - DAY

A modern take on the Medieval castle kitchen towering ceilings
dark wood copper pots hanging a series of walk-in coolers and
freezers The place is a madhouse of activity as prep cooks
slice chop sort every kind of food imaginable and delivery
teams bring more

The girls walk through Alone together in the eye of the
hurricane Kim choked with excess sentiment

KIMMY
Look at all this beautiful food
so lovingly prepared

JULIANNE
Theyll eat it anyway you ever
been to a walk

Kimmys lip trembles This is not how she thought of her wedding
The din is so horrific Kimmy leads them into a walk-in meat
locker Even here two BUTCHERS are dressing Eastern-fresh corn-
fed carcasses

JULIANNE
You guys want to give us a
minute

The men blink at each other

JULIANNE
Wed like to be alone with
our pork

frozen fowl parts Stares up with big sweet wet eyes

Harder and harder for Julianne to push Her mouth is dry

JULIANNE
Yeah well lots of couples are

Fragile and strong at once A plea
KIMMY
Tell him its my fault and
that I love him

A long beat

JULIANNE
Ill be right back

EXT TENNIS COURT - DAY

The court has become a giant holding pen for tonights BALLOONS
There are maybe a billion in assorted colors already blowing in all
directions under clear plastic sheeting which has ben spread
across the top of the courts chain-link fence
Michael stands outside the court clutching the chain link like a
prisoner as Julianne comes through the gate From somewhere we
hear high squeaky alien voice-like SOUNDS Incongruous
against

MICHAEL
How is she

Julianne absorbs this As the bizarre SOUNDS continue she WHIRLS
around

JULIANNE
KNOCK IT OFF

We now see three STONER COLLEGE GUYS who have been filling the
endless array of balloons from helium tanks at center court
Clearly theyve been inhaling their working materials

STONER KID
(Minnie Mouse)
YES SIR

A Nazi salute When she turns back

MICHAEL
I asked you

JULIANNE
She admits its her fault

He absorbs that And then

MICHAEL
Do you think she still loves
me

We watch the struggle inside her Her voice drops

JULIANNE
Sure she does Shes crazy
about you

Now tears stand in both their eyes The stoners are doing their
Alvin and the Chipmuks impersonation festival in the BG singing
in castrato harmony But our two dont notice

MICHAEL
I keep asking how can I explain
what happened And I keep
getting that same answer all
night long

Which is

MICHAEL
I cant And it doesnt matter
I drove her to it because I
want things my way And even
if she did something tricky and
unfair she was blinded by
love okay

Julianne swallows For obvious reasons

JULIANNE
Does that make it right

MICHAEL
Love doesnt have to be right
It just has to be love

The stoner are now helium-crooning Bridge Over Troubled Waters
Actually theyre getting better

MICHAEL
Shes giving up half her life
for me and Im bitching because
it hurts her

STONERS
(singing)

Sail on silver girl
Sail on by

MICHAEL
Shes a saint And Ima
worthless ingrate

STONERS
(singing)
Your time has come to shine
All your dreams are on their way

MICHAEL
Tell her Ill marry her at six
oclock if shell still have me

The stoners blend on the high note Its pretty moving

JULIANNE
Ill be right back

INT ORGAN LOFT - DAY
PAN along a gigantic serpentine stack of wedding presents Nearly

twelve feet high the pile curves along the balcony high above the
diners in the Great Room extending al the way to

an organ loft Alone above the noise of the party Julianne
and Kimmy have just reached the top of the staircase Trapped
between ten tons of lavish gifts and the keyboard of the mammoth
organ Dwarfed by their surroundings Kimmy draws the hardest
breath of her life
KIMMY
(whispers)
So What did he say

Juliannes eyes move over the young girls face

JULIANNE
He said Marry me

Kimmy YELPS in her ecstasy FLINGING herself against Julianne and
they go DOWN full length across the organs pedals BLASTING the
room with a MONSTER CHORD of china-rattling volume and horrifying
disharmony

As grown men and women SCREAM in spontaneous terror below Kimmy
begins to

LAUGH And KISS and hug her new sister And holds her tight
EXT WILLOW POND - DAY

Julianne and Michael walk the gravel path beside a breathtaking
POND ringed with WILLOWS that dig heavy branches to the waters
surface He is relieved reflective Head down he never notices
that she is

dangerously freaked Too petrified even to hyperventilate
were lucky shes breathing at all We watch her life unraveling
before her glassy eyes

MICHAEL
(never looks up)
Thank God you were here

JULIANNE
(mumbles to herself)
Oh yeah
MICHAEL
I was so confused so conflicted
so unstable
JULIANNE

Well it happens
They pass an expanse of lawn which has become the event parking
area Family vehicles delivery trucks service vans Everything

that couldnt fit on the circular front driveway

MICHAEL
I might have thrown away

Searching for the right words

JULIANNE
your one chance for true
happiness

MICHAEL
yeah that

JULIANNE
You never want to do that see
thats always a costly
turnover As they say in the
sport biz

Theres a vague Stepford Wife quality to her voice He hears that
now and looks at her Maybe he cant tell shes frightened But
he can tell shes something

MICHAEL
(softly)
Are you okay

She stops walking She cant look at him so she looks around
Across the lawn crews are moving equipment into the brightly-
colored tents unfolding and setting up stacks of tables and
chairs raising the poles between which all those balloons will be
strung At the center of it all

» a huge topiary White Sox batter just completing a murderous
swing Hes maybe fifteen feet tall She points to it

JULIANNE
The Big Hurt huh

MICHAEL
Nellie Fox Walter likes the
past And he likes the little
guys

So Julianne nods Because she does too Squints up at Michael

JULIANNE
Got a minute

He nods you bet Worried for her What is this She looks in
another direction and we now see that we have nearly reached

» a stage thats been set up for the band Chairs music stands
sound equipment A gleaming dance floor already in place over the
lawn Next to it a shimmering white GAZEBO Like the centerpiece
of a wedding cake

JULIANNE
Why is the dance floor by the
gazebo

She takes his hand They walk toward it

MICHAEL
Kimmys idea She thought it
would be such a romantic place
For our wedding dance

Looking down at her

MICHAEL
Whats up

JULIANNE
Shhh

Up the white steps now Together The gazebo floor has been
covered with hardwood The perfect place For a wedding dance
And Julianne

turns suddenly He almost runs into her She is staring up
at him so strangely their bodies only inches apart He is caught
transfixed by the intensity in her eyes

JULIANNE
I have to say this quick okay
or Ill have this massive
coronary and youll never have
to hear it Which you need to
Does that make any sense at all

The coronary part does We can feel her heart beating from here

MICHAEL
Jules whats wrong

JULIANNE
This is the dumbest thing I will
ever do So dumb in fact that
I cant I dont think

And then she does She puts her hands flat on his chest Looks
in his eyes

JULIANNE
Michael I love you

A heartbeat passes

JULIANNE
Ive loved you for nine years
but I was too arrogant and
scared to realize it Now Im
just scared

He stares at her dumbstruck She moves even closer

JULIANNE
I know this comes at an
inopportune time but I have to
ask this one really gigantic
favor okay
Holds her breath And

JULIANNE
Choose me Marry me Let me
make you happy

And in a half beat of excruciating silence

JULIANNE
I know It sounds like three
favors

His eyes are loving They care for her She swallows lost in
them

JULIANNE
But when you think about it

Slides her arms around his neck and raises her mouth

to his The most beautiful kiss she will ever offer All of
her heart is in this and as his hands touch her body

» a SCREAM rips the world to pieces They whirl to see

KIMMY halfway up the path Her hands across her mouth as if
to stem the horror that pours forth as she SHRIEKS from her soul
and

runs Back Down the path Michael BOLTING after her SHOUTING
her name A frozen moment and

Julianne TAKES OFF after him All three running SCREAMING
their various emotions at the top of their lungs as workmen stop
to watch from neighboring countries

Kimmy staring from halfway there has an insurmountable lead
LEAPS into her convertible and PEELS OUT just TEARING up the
gravel as she ROCKETS out of sight No way to catch her Still

Michael is racing for the cars Julianne sprinting her guts
out losing ground with every stride Michael JUMPS into a
Cherokee

JULIANNE
MICHAEL DONT YOULL NEVER
CATCH HER

He GRINDS the gears She keeps RUNNING His engine FIRES
JULIANNE
SHE HAS TOO BIG A LEAD AND SHE
DRIVES LIKE A RABID ANIMAL

He BLASTS OFF She keeps going Gasping for air clutching her side
shes dying here Slams into a florists truck looks inside shit
Next a butchers van looks inside Jesus

JULIANNE
(to the world at large)
DOESNT ANYBODY LEAVE KEYS
ANYMORE WHATEVER HAPPENED TO
TRUST

Up ahead Michael has STALLED the Cherokee She still has a chance
DASHES to the next van BORNSTEIN EXTERMINATION a handsome
rendering of a rat above the TOXIC MATERIALS warning FLINGS the
door open Stumbles in Keys

JULIANNE (0OS)
THANK GOD A SAMARITAN

Michael SPEEDS away She KICKS the ratmobile in gear
LURCHES off
INT RATMOBILE DOWNTOWN CHICAGO - DAY

Julianne tearing through traffic desperately struggling to keep
Michaels Cherokee in view while she shrieks into her cellular

JULIANNE
IT IS NOT GOING WELL

Down the block Michael WHIPS around a corner We follow suit to see
his destination dead ahead Union Station The DISPATCHER RADIO
intrudes

DISPATCHER (0S)
Uh Unit Four Baker Charlie
how we cookin on that Skokiie
infestation

Now shes steering the car tearing at the radio controls and
screaming into the phone cradled on her shoulder

JULIANNE
THIS IS WHAT COMES OF TELLING
THE TRUTH

FIELD MAN (0S)
Copy dispatcher

JULIANNE
OR EVEN PART OF IT

FIELD MAN (0S)
Uh what happens if you got
that methyl-ethyl shit on
your hands

Michael RIPS into the train stations parking lot We SWERVE
around a taxi CUT OFF Harley CAREEN into the lot
JULIANNE
GETTING WHAT YOU DESERVE IS
NOT FAIR

DISPATCHER (OS)
Uh you got maybe thirty seconds
before youre sterile For Gods
sake dont touch yourself or
anything

Up ahead Michael is OUT of his jeep and running

JULIANNE
AND I HATE TALKING TO YOUR
MACHINE

She SLAMS on the brakes THROWING herself against the wheel

YOUNGER FIELD MAN (0OS)
Uh this is One Monkey Zebra
It wasnt bees in the gals
wall it was cats

She TEARS the door open SCRAMBLE OUT

YOUNGER FIELD MAN (0OS)
She says gas em anyway
shell pay cash Uh how
do I pay this

WITH Julianne now RACING through the lot Michael vanishes INTO
the Station she PLUNGES in after him BOUNCING off bystanders
apologizing lunging on gasping for breath past exhaustion
threatening clumsily through the crowd like a staggering drunk
catching a lucky glimpse as he heads

DOWN a staircase to the TRACKS My God whats he doing A
second wind fueled by panic and she BOLTS after him DANCING down
the steep staircase somehow without killing herself reaching the
concourse to see him running for

Track 29 a train already RUMBLING ready to pull out she
SPRINTS after him

JULIANNE
MICHAEL

He DISAPPEARS behind the train she FALLS skids springs up
pushes through gaping onlookers almost there the train PULLS
AWAY

JULIANNE
NNNOOOO

But hes just standing there His back to us Watching it go
Her body nearly collapses with relief She pushes herself on but
her legs arent working right in their maxed-out fatigue and she
lopes and staggers until she comes up behind him Hes still lost
in thought staring after the train

She tries to speak but theres no breath So she puts her hands
on her knees and just GASPS for air like a dog Wheezing panting
trying once more to speak but she cant yet and then he casually
turns and

JUMPS out of his skin A heart attack seeing her

JULIANNE
(croaks)
Dont speak

He just blinks at this sweaty ripped-up maniacal figure

MICHAEL
Uh I saw that moving

JULIANNE
DONT SPEAK

FLINGING both her hands across his mouth A frozen beat He nods
okay Cautiously she takes her hands away At least she has made
him smile in spite of everything At least shes done that

JULIANNE
I have to make a confession
Another confession Besides
that I love you This is even
worse

This Hes waiting to hear
JULIANNE

The E-mail You thought Walter
sent your boss I wrote that

You WHAT Synapse overload
MICHAEL
Youre not saying you actually
youre saying that y
JULIANNE
(stricken with remorse)

wrote it yeah Im the
bad guy

MICHAEL
ARE YOU CRAZY

She nods her head wildly hair flopping

MICHAEL
ARE YOU ABSOLUTELY INSANE
Bigger nodding

MICHAEL
ARE YOU ON DRUGS

Shakes her head like a two-year-old
MICHAEL

(pacing in circles)
I mean do you realize what

youve well of course you
realize thats why youre
confessing I mean I mean

how could you do that

JULIANNE
I didnt know it would get
sent I just wanted you to
get mad at Kimmy and

And watching As this begins to sink in

JULIANNE
Ive done nothing but slimy
underhanded despicable not
even terribly imaginative
things Ever since I got
here Trying to

Staring in his eyes Eyes she cant read at this point

JULIANNE
to win you To win you
back

Tears in her own eyes now Big ones

JULIANNE
And I was blinded by love
Like you said

Shaking her head

JULIANNE
But that doesnt excuse any
part of it I am pond scum

No

JULIANNE
Actually Lower I am the fungus
that feeds on pond scum Lower
The layer of mucous that cruds up
the fung
MICHAEL

Lower
JULIANNE
(agreeing)
Lower
MICHAEL

The pus that infects the mucous
that cruds up the fungus

And to her amazement The trace of a smile

MICHAEL
(softly)
On the other hand thank you

She blinks at that Which squeezes out a tear

MICHAEL
For loving me that much that
way

He shrugs Just above a whisper

MICHEL
Its pretty flattering

JULIANNE
Except it makes me fungus

MICHAEL
Well that part I knew

Shes never loved him more

JULIANNE
So you have to marry Kim
Because she will actually make
you happy I in contrast am
a shallow neurotic psychopath
with relatively little to offer

Okay

JULIANNE
Kim Nod your head Do as
youre told

He nods his head still smiling Her tears are running now Maybe
she doesnt notice

JULIANNE
Just promise youll never tell
me who you would have chosen
If I hadnt confessed
She chokes back a sob

JULIANNE
Cos if you would have chosen me
Then I threw away a perfectly
good life Just to be a decent
person Which is a questionable
trade-off Right

He nods slowly Because hes supposed to

JULIANNE
And if you would have chosen
some 20-year-old punk over me
Id have to kill myself

Ah His smile keeps getting smaller More loving More wonderful
MICHAEL
(whispers)
Ill take it to my grave
Good She looks around
JULIANNE
Im so glad you didnt jump on

that train before

MICHAEL
I came here looking for her

For her The words leave a silence

JULIANNE
Why would she come here

MICHAEL
This is where I proposed

Stares deep in her eyes She needs to hear this

MICHAEL
I had to cover a game in
Milwaukee She saw me off
And when the train started to

leave I jumped up on the
step I help the handle and
without

He grins Has to admit
MICHAEL
without a thought in my head

I shouted Marry me

I did Now her eyes tear up again And she doesnt know why
MICHAEL
And she gasped and covered her
mouth and the train was pulling
out and suddenly she screamed
YES Just once And blew me a
kiss

What a girl

MICHAEL
I never forgot that

JULIANNE
Its two weeks

MICHAEL
Almost three

JULIANNE
That is so romantic

Which makes him reach and touch her hair

MICHAEL
I just wonder if you know why

Do you

MICHAEL
Its because romance isnt
mystery and tricks and doubts
and halting unspoken longings
Thats not the real romance

Tears in his eyes now First time

MICHAEL
The real romance is saying yes

Does she know that now He looks at his watch

MICHAEL
(sighs)
Woulda been a nice wedding

Oh That

JULIANNE
(urgently)
You cant believe youve lost
her Sooner or later youll
find her and youll look in
each others eyes and youll
see all that love

JULIANNE
Course if its later rather
than sooner Id hate to be you
at six oclock

(beat)
Youve got a lot of explaining
to
MICHAEL

Im just thinking of how shes
hurting Lost Alone Like
her life is over

JULIANNE
Thats little egotistical

He glares at her

JULIANNE
But undoubtedly accurate

She claps her hands galvanized by the emergency
JULIANNE

Okay well split up You go
to every romantic place you

guys have Ill go someplace
brilliant and the first one
who

MICHAEL

If you find her
Strange tone A gentle warning

MICHAEL
The kiss May be hard For
you to explain
(beat)
Because the only fear she
really has is

JULIANNE
me yeah And she likes
Tommy Lasorda Case closed

Looks at her own watch Shit

MICHAEL
But if you do get to her first

She looks up
MICHAEL
There is something you are

Incoming

And she crawls UNDER the door on her belly We go WITH her to

ANGLES outside the stall Juliannes feet sticking out under

KIMMY (0OS)
Shit THE TIME

The two BURST out of the stall hand-in-hand at a desperate DEAD
RUN past us HEAR them EXPLODE out the door and

five stalls OPEN Women exit crying
EXT UNIVERSITY CHAPEL - TWILIGHT

A taxi pulls up in front of an ivy-covered CHAPEL fronted by nearly

a hundred souls milling about in attitude ranging from overstimulated
curiosity to clinical hyperanxiety Our girls JUMP out of the cab
and half the crowd starts running toward us twins in the lead

SAMMY
Whatever hap

JULIANNE
(cutting this short)
We were bonding we lost track
were officially sorry now
lets put it behind us

Kim WAVES at her mom by the chapel entrance And takes Juliannes
hand for support
JULIANNE
Believe me we got a bride whos
worth waiting for yes

Everybody nods

JULIANNE
Out of our way

EXT DRESSING ROOM - TWILIGHT

White Pure blinding white Across FRAME floats more white this
gauzy and ethereal It settles its roots planting deeply in the
brides hair TILTS UP to

the face of the woman who placed it there Juliannes eyes
appraising this bride we cannot see And so softly

JULIANNE
Dont worry sugar

Dont worry

JULIANNE
When he looks at you it will
be as if

The words stronger Because there is no smile

JULIANNE
hes never seen a woman
before

PAN DOWN the white until we are
CLOSE on the brides perfect slippers HOLD And
INT CHAPEL - EVENING

Begins to slowly PAN BACK UP the length of an exquisite gown We
can tell from the organ the nearby thrum of expectant voices that
we are nearing the moment We reach

Kimmys hand Firmly clasping Walters Keep PANNING the
bodice the lace her throat and finally we are CLOSE on

the face of the bride Now we understand the word radiant We
also understand scared senseless Our perfect unflappable Kimmy
is in a trance of emotional overload where bliss and panic
seamlessly blend

The organs noddling stops Kimmys eyes alerted like a small
animal bearing a predator approach her thicket Suddenly the
CHORD The Wedding March from Wagners Lohengrin Here Comes
The bride And we SNAP TO

FULL ANGLE Kim and Walter This is it
WALTER
(whispers)
Left foot

REVERSE ANGLE Kims POV the chapel every pew packed every neck
craning this way the white satin carpet down the endless aisle to
where

Michael waits Also in a zone of pseudo-consciousness From which
he attempts a smile Not comforting Kims POV WHIP PAN the
groomsmen the twins LOCKING FOCUS on Julianne standing strong
and beautiful a glow of her own in the daffodil dress She sends
her little sister a WINK across the trackless miles of aisle You
can do this kid So

Kimmy does On her fathers arm she walks the gauntlet of the
worlds intrusive admiration One step at a time The most beautiful
she will ever be She is dazzling the crowd and managing to not throw
up at the same time

And shes there At his side She glances back to her maid of
honor just to make sure shes not working without a net So
Julianne

CROSSES her eyes Which lets the kid smile and finally take a
breath Have a little fun huh Kim nods got it turns to

The Minister Who stands before them with a calming presence
Thank God someone has done this before The crowd has hushed
The Ministers eyes are only for two His words are for all

MINISTER
Michael and Kimmy wrote these
words She asked me to confide
mostly Michael

A ripple of laughter Gentle and fine They are setting in

MINISTER
So he gets to say them

A surprise A pleasant one The crowd adjust in its seats As
Michael begins

MICHAEL
Why do people get married
anymore

And on these words We SNAP to Julianne Share her interest in
the bluntness the simplicity the unorthodoxy of this beginning

MICHAEL (0S)
Why not live together amicably
with no sense of obligation
beyond the moment
Her eyes Shes listening

MICHAEL (0OS)
As long as the sex is good As
long as no one more interesting
has wandered into view As long
as the thousand conflicts of two
individual wills remain
comfortably compromised

PANNING now Other faces Isabelle Proud to the bone

MICHAEL (0OS)
And when one feels the urge to
move on to explore the new
No guilt no disgrace no
promise broken

Walter His eyes damp Against our expectation

MICHAEL (0S)
No agony of having dishonored
a time When our hearts And
the world were different

Joe nods as he hears

MICHAEL (0S)
Marriage is a lot to put up
with

Julianne once more No breath Rapt

MICHAEL (0S)
The answer must be That there
is some need basic to the human
heart Thatu embracing the obligation
of commitment fulfills

Her eyes have clouded As if Michael is talking to her

MICHAEL (0S)
Some need to belong to one another
in a way which rages against the
notion that all is impermanent
Against the notion of mortality

And suddenly ALL the feeling rises in her throat
MICHAEL (0OS)
Our love is bigger And longer

Than life itself

And the tears come They come freely unhidden unnoticed As if
they were needed

Michael now Looking at his bride
MICHAEL
Thats what we want And marriage
Is what we do about it

Kimmy smiles at him With love bigger than life itself

MICHAEL
We are fools in this Thank
God Almighty

He is done There is a silence

MINISTER
Boy that was good

People LAUGH The Minister holds up a sheet of paper For the
crowd to see Mostly paragraphs crossed out in red ink

MINISTER
Michael and Kim also edited what
they want me to say

More laughter

MINISTER
The idea was were only marrying
once We have to remember it
forever Lets keep to the good
stuff
(squints at the sheet)
You may kiss the bride

Bigger LAUGHTER The Minister waves this off his little joke
Turns to the best man pantomimes the ring As the hammered gold
circle is handed to Michael Julianne absently scratches her still-
swollen finger Mandy taps Julianne on the arm and produces

a matching ring Take it Gives it to her So Julianne steps
forward Places the second ring into Kimmys waiting hand Their
eyes meet and hold throughout

MINISTER (OS)
If anyone here can show just cause
why this man and woman should not
be married speak now Or forever
hold your peace

Julianne CLEARS her throat Kimmys heart flutters In the
silence Juliannes wonderful smile Just kidding

Michael reaches for Kims hand turns her gently to him Places
his ring on her finger Holds her hands

MICHAEL
Kimberly I promise to love
And respect and comfort you
To hear your voice and your
heart Until we are parted
by death

She swallows Smiles a fleeting beautiful smile Fumbles
slightly putting the ring on his finger

KIMMY
Michael I promise to love and
respect and comfort you To
hear your voice and your heart
Until we are parted by death

Staring in each others eyes A moment so fragile the Minister
waits an extra beat

MINISTER
For the record you each agree
to marry the other

KIMMY
(quickly)
I do
MICHAEL
(smiling)
I do

The Minister joins their right hands

MINISTER
We havent said much about God
this evening I know But He
is here And He is happy To
bless His wonderful children

CLOSE now on Julianne For the inevitable moment

MINISTER (OS)
In that Michael and Kimberly have
given themselves to each other by
solemn vows and the exchanging
of rings

Unnoticed by the world Her eyes are close
MINISTER (OS)
I pronounce them husband and wife
Those whom God has joined together
let no one put asunder

The eyes open Wet brave ready for

MINISTER (0S)
Now Kiss the bride

Julianne watching As Michael does
EXT WALLACE POND - NIGHT

This is what all the preparation was for Tables lights balloons
the guests dancing on the hardwood floor at the base of the gazebo
The bride and groom among them relaxed and happy Two who are one
PAN TO

the stage the band playing Julianne conferring with the twins
and the band leader clear that shes giving the instructions
Then she takes her glass of champagne to the microphone

KLUNKS it for silence The band stops The dancers follow
All eyes are comfortably turned to the maid of honor She looks to
the couple Just below her Then to the crowd

JULIANNE
Im a writer too not as
good as Michael But I do
steal from quality

She raises her glass Everyone at the table does the same

JULIANNE
This is to my best friend On
the occasion of his wedding

Shouts of support a few whistles Silence She tells Michael

JULIANNE
If I have truly come to know
your bride as my new sister
This is in her heart

She has to stop Swallows Because she will not let herself cry

JULIANNE
Understand Ill slip quietly
away from the noisy crowd when
I see the pale stars rising
blooming over the oaks

Deep breath Looks in his eyes

JULIANNE
Tll pursue solitary pathways
through the pale twilit meadows
with only this one dream You
come too

A hush SHARP applause From four hundred hands But not from
his He is too moved Too understanding of what he has heard

JULIANNE
I dont have a wedding gift
But this is on loan Until
you two find your song
And with that the band begins The opening phrases of a song we
have come to know Michael seems overwhelmed Julianne nods
toward the gazebo

Michael takes his brides hand leads her up the stairs into
his arms as the twins step to the microphone and guests begin to
applaud an unscheduled wedding dance

MANDY SAMMY
(singing)
Someday when Im awfully low
And the world is cold
I will feel a glow just thinking of you
And the way you look tonight

Soft two-part harmony As perfect as the words

MANDY SAMMY
(singing)
Youre lovely With your smile so warm
And your cheeks so soft
There is nothing for me but to love you
Just the way you look tonight

Julianne can cry now Because shes tied with half the place

MANDY SAMMY
(singing)
With each word your tenderness grows
Tearing my fears apart
And the laugh that wrinkles your nose
Touches my foolish heart

Julianne begins to sing Unheard Unseen Even by the man shes
singing to

JULIANNE MANDY SAMMY
(singing)
Youre lovely please dont ever change
Keep that breathless charm
Darling please arrange it cos I love you
Just the way you look tonight

The band keeps playing The dance goes on Two people lost in each
other The way its supposed to be

INT GREAT ROOM - LATE NIGHT
Bedlam Julianne caught in the middle of the throng A young
couple dressed for travel appear at the top of the staircase

The SHOUT are deafening The bride has her bouquet

she spots Julianne far below THROWS it her way Julianne
reflexively GOES FOR IT

» not a fucking chance The twins nearly TRAMPLE her in the
stampede Mandy WRESTING the prize from Sammys grasp Everyone
CHEERS and then the couple is

FLYING down the stairs RACING through the crowd with a
protective phalanx of groomsmen bodyguards heading for the door
for freedom

Julianne trapped in the crush loses sight of the couple
struggles against the flow suddenly panicked by the certainty
that she will never see him before

And then hes THERE He has Julianne in his arms Holding her
so tight An embrace so wonderful so terrible she could go mad
from the confusion alone Against the din he murmurs in her
ear

MICHAEL
Wherever I go However far

She sobs Holds him
Deep deep breath
JULIANNE
You win a few you lose a few
Some get rained out
And to her surprise
DIGGER
(VO very softly)
You have a good time

To her greater surprise There are a few tears left after all

JULIANNE
I did what I came to do

DIGGER
(VO even softer)
Good girl

She just cant speak now So she doesnt
DIGGER (VO)
I was thinking Maybe you might
visit us for awhile Weve got
the room made up

This fucking guy God she loves him

JULIANNE
Ill think about it Im okay

DIGGER (VO)
Oh youre more than okay
Just above a whisper

JULIANNE
You too

And with the last of her strength
JULIANNE
If the sun comes up Ill see
you tomorrow huh
A chuckle At the other end
DIGGER (VO)
Ill play those odds You have

sweet dreams

We hear the CLICK She turns her back on the stars Shoulders
straight Chin up

She walks from frame

FADE TO BLACK HOLD END CREDITS
