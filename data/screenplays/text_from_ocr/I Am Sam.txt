INT SAMS APARTMENT - DAWN

A marvel of organization A closet reveals clothes on
hangers exactly equidistant from each other precisely

T-shirts underwear and socks organized by color A
carefully systemized record collection fills makeshift
bookshelves

Beatles posters from every era decorate the walls

things sit in one corner An island of chaos in an Hold
Everything showroom The kitchen counter has been
transformed into a changing table Bottles and pacifiers
lined up next to a stack of cloth diapers Underneath a
clothes line of baby clothes

The sound of a CRYING BABY breaks the silence The camera
follows and finds the CRADLE a DRAWER tucked snugly into

blanket hanging like a hammock between two chairs An
exhausted SAM POPS up from his bed behind the hammock

swings the hammock hoping against hope the baby will go
to sleep

TO

INT COURTROOM - DAY
We HEAR A VOICE

VOICE (0S)
All rise for the Honorable Judge Phillip
McNeily

Sam stands along with others in the courtroom The Judge

enters and sits Everyone else sits now too Except
Sam

Who continues to stand until Rita pulls him down Now we

see

Ifty Robert Brad - and Brads MOTHER who sits several

seats behind Brad knitting Robert holds up a handmade
sign

from the back of the courtroom Free Lucy Dawson

INT COURTROOM - ONE HOUR LATER
Turner the prosecuting attorney examines his first

witness
Hes disheveled but dont let the rumpled suit fool you
is

the

SLIDE

This man is razor-sharp The THERAPIST who evaluated Sam
on the stand Sam anxiously rearranges all the pens on
desk he sits at with Rita Projected on a SCREEN is a

of the drawing Lucy made in school

THERAPIST
there is an unhealthy reversal of
roles here
As you can see from her drawings she
has an exaggerated sense of
responsibility Lucy feels she has to
take care of her father Although at
her birthday party her true feelings
about her father were revealed

RITA
Objection True feelings revealed

TURNER
The state is paying Miss Geller for her
opinions -

RITA

Then every child who rages because they
didnt get to stay up for that extra
hour of TV -

TURNER
Objection your honor -

Sam TUGS at Ritas sleeve She ignores it

RITA
in fact any child who said they hated
their parents because they didnt want
to take a bath would be a prime
candidate for Foster Care

TURNER
Objection

SAM
I think they want you to stop

RITA
Really Thank you Sam

JUDGE MCNEILY
We all appreciate your assistance Mr
Dawson - continue with your witness Mr
Turner

TURNER
Now Ms Geller I assume in your therapy
session Mr Dawson extolled his
parenting abilities

THERAPIST
On the contrary Mr Dawson admitted he
felt profoundly inadequate - that he was
terrified hed made and would continue
to make - and I quote Huge mistakes
huge mistakes mistakes that are huge

TURNER
No further questions

Rita starts to scribble notes furiously So does Sam

Turner smugly sits down Rita confidently strides toward
the

witness

RITA
Youre a mother arent you Ms Geller

THERAPIST
Yes

RITA
Would it be fair to say that as a
parent youve felt confused from time
to time possibly overwhelmed on
occasion even though youre a wonderful
mother

TURNER
Objection Its Mr Dawsons parenting
Not Ms Gellers thats at question
here

RITA
But if Ms Geller has never had a moment
where she felt confused as a mother it
would bias her opinion And it is her
expert opinion were all after isnt
it Mr Turner

JUDGE MCNEILY
Overruled I1l allow it

RITA
Thank you your Honor Ms Geller I
know there have been many moments as a
parent where Ive felt Ive made huge
mistakes - mistakes that are huge And
Ive had to admit them to myself My
husband But most importantly to my
therapist Which is the guise Mr
Dawson thought he was seeing you under
isnt that right Ms Geller

TURNER
Objection

JUDGE MCNEILY
Get to the point Ms Harrison

RITA
The point is youve never had those
moments have you Ms Geller Moments
that every parent Ive ever spoken to
has - moments when youve felt the task
is so unbelievably challenging that you
feel retarded disabled in some way
Moments when you feel everyone has the
key but you But youve never had those
moments have you Ms Geller

THERAPIST

RITA
Yes or no

THERAPIST

RITA
Let me rephrase the question When your
son oded -

TURNER
Objection

RITA
But if Ms Geller didnt feel she had
made mistakes - mistakes that were huge
it might bias her opinion toward Mr
Dawson

JUDGE MCNEILY
I will -
RITA
Thank you So Ms Geller - yes or no -
when your son oded did you feel you
might have made mistakes mistakes that
were huge

THERAPIST
(tearfully)
Yes

correct

DR DONOVAN
Yes

RITA
What kept you going the twelve years you

DR DONOVAN
Caffeine Sugar And my mothers

RITA
I wish I had a mother like that She
must have been smart

DR DONOVAN
She had great instincts

RITA
Do you have any idea what her IQ was

DR DONOVAN
In the lower ranges About eighty

RITA
So your mother this woman with the IQ
of a nine-year old had the wisdom to
recognize that you would be a great
doctor I guess her disability didnt
seem to hold you back in life

DR DONOVAN
No My mothers condition taught me
what they cant teach you compassion
and patience

RITA
Traits most doctors have in spades
Thank you no further questions

Sam runs to hug Dr Donovan bumping into Rita who sits
him
down

TURNER
Howd you get through medical school
Whered you live

DR DONOVAN
We lived with my mothers parents

TURNER
Oh Grandma and Grandpa Would it be
fair to say your grandparents were of
normal intelligence

DR DONOVAN
Yes

TURNER
And didnt these people - your
grandparents - with normal intelligence -
have the real responsibilities

RITA
(relishing this)
Objection I hear Mr Turners mother
in-law lives with him She must help
out Does that mean he doesnt have the
real -

TURNER
Motion to strike that from the record
rrelevant immaterial and immature -

RITA
rrelevant Any parent has a right to
a support system

TURNER

m not talking about the rights of the
parent Im talking about the rights of
a child

(the gavel bangs)
m talking about entrusting an eight
year olds welfare in the hands of
someone whose records show he was
diagnosed with infantile autism mental
retardation

RITA
Objection Motion to strike that from
the record Its clear that ones
intellectual capacity has no bearing on
their ability to love You Honor would
you please instruct council to proceed
with a modicum of sensitivity

TURNER
Oh Im sensitive Im real sensitive
when I see people like you --

I go from here John had been
listening to Nina Simone There was a
line in it that went something like I
love you I love you I love you
They put that into the song It
wouldnt be the same song without that
It made the song complete Thats why
the whole world cried when they broke up
on April 10 1970

ON RITA

MARY the Stenographer is still typing

JUDGE MCNEILY

SAM

TURNER

SAM
My friends love Lucy even if Rita
thought they werent smart enough to
testify Even if she said youd wipe

TURNER

Excuse me Mr Dawson your lawyer just
objected that means you didnt have to
answer the question You cant even
follow the simple rules youve watched
here day after day You really think
you can raise a seven-year old A ten
year old A thirteen-year old

(in his face)
That means shell be six years more
advanced than you

Sweat pours down Sams coffee stained collar He searches

for words

The court

Then from the clearest place inside himself

SAM
Ive had a lot of time to think about
whatever it is that makes somebody a
good parent It has to do with
constancy It has to do with patience
It has to do with listening To
pretending to listen when you cant even
listen anymore

is riveted by Sams eloquence Ritas amazed

SAM (CONTD)
It has to do with love like she says

Ritas antenna goes up whos she

SAM (CONTD)

And I dont know where its written that
a woman has a corner on that market
that a man has any less of those
emotions than a woman Billy has a home
with me Its not perfect Im nota
perfect parent Sometimes I forget hes
just a little kid

We built a life together and we love
each other and if you destroy that it

created

an origami wall of newspapers intricately woven together

Shes crying too hard to continue He pulls her to him
Before she realizes whats happening shes holding him
tightly He whispers in her ear

SAM
Youre enough Youre so much more than
enough

He looks her straight in the eye - shes undone by the
intimacy of the moment by the strength of his purity

staring into his eyes she begins to sob walls crumbling
He kisses her elbow her shoulder her forehead her eyes
her tears And something ignites between them - something

confused and scary and deep and filled with a passionate
ache

a bigger apartment so that -

Ritas hair falls in her eyes again Sam stands up pulls
HER BARRETTE from his pocket the one she left at his

Rita stares at the barrette as if it were the murder

RITA
Oh thank you What aa lovely
barrette Mr Dawson It will look
great on Lucy Who Im sure you bought
it for Furthermore so thatthere
at

will be more room for Lucy as she grows
up

MARGARET BROWN
All of that is well and good but the
fact that Mr Dawson quite his job
missed his hearing and did not even
show up for his visits with his
daughter

RITA
The fact that my client went through
profound depression is the most natural
reaction any parent could have

MARGARET BROWN
But once again he had no idea how his
behavior during that depression impacted
on his daughter

RITA
In these next months Mr Dawson will be
expanding his support system to include
Social Service programs tutors --

petitioning the court for sole custody
of Lucy and I fully support their
request
