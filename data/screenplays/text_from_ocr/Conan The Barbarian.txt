OVER BLACK

In the darkness we hear the solitary sound of a HEARTBEAT
resounding like a drum

NARRATOR (VO)

In between the years when the
oceans drank Atlantis and the rise
of the Sons of Aryas there was an
age undreamed of when shining
kingdoms lay spread across the
world like blue mantles under the
stars Hither came Conan the
Cimmerian a thief a slayer a
king born of battle

Muffled sounds as if underwater echo CLANGING swords the
guttural CRIES of combat

UNBORN BABY
Eyes closed floating at peace within red glow of the womb

Suddenly a flash of steel as a sword pierces the womb its
tip not an inch from the babys head

As the sword is ripped out light streams in from outside

travel with it into the DIN of BATTLE
built

EXT CIMMERIA - MUDDY FIELD - DAY

A blonde-haired armored AESIR RAIDER withdraws the bloody
sword from the stomach of ISLENE a wild-maned Cimmerian
beauty many months pregnant now clutching her bloody
stomach

Across a muddy battlefield the air a maelstrom of falling
snowflakes and embers from trees aflame the powerfully

CORIN rallies his fellow CIMMERIANS until he spots Islene

CORIN
Islene

Wielding a broadsword runes etched into its surface Corin
cuts a bloody path through his enemies his eyes never
leaving Islene

The Aesir standing over Islene LAUGHS as she claws at the
earth behind her trying to pull herself away

AESIR
Now now little whore Did I get
you or your little one

Islenes hand reaches back once again -- and it finds a
fallen warriors SWORD In one fluid motion she swings the
sword around her body and drives it into the gap in the
Aesirs armor -- at his groin

ISLENE

Id ask you the same

The Aesir HOWLS in agony raising his sword to deliver the

illing blow -- when another sword pierces his chest The
Aesir falls revealing Corin standing behind him

Corin throws aside his horned helmet and falls to his knees
beside Islene checking her wound When he pulls his hands
back they are coated in blood

Their eyes meet Torment Loss They both know She pulls a
nife from the folds of her pelts puts it in his hand

ISLENE (CONTD)
Take your child

CORIN
I cannot

Islene looks to her naked belly The baby inside presses
against its womb a visible impression on her flesh

ISLENE
There is no time husband I would
see my childs face

Islenes eyes flutter as she struggles Corin lowers the
knife Islenes eyes lock with Corins as he puts the knife
to use Never once does she scream

A moment later Corin lifts the crying blood-covered BOY up
through the falling snowflakes to Islenes lap

ISLENE (CONTD)
A boy He will be strong A warrior
with no equal

CORIN
Do not speak love

ISLENE
You have never been able to still
my tongue and you will not this
day He will be wild Corin You
must temper him

She shares one kiss with her child its first taste not of

mothers milk but of her blood

ISLENE (CONTD)
(FADING)
Conan His--name--is--Conan
CONAN
The boys eyes are as deep and blue as the Eastern Sea

EXT CIMMERIAN VILLAGE - DAY

A small Cimmerian village lies in a heavily forested valley
a redoubt from the icy mountains surrounding it
Round wooden huts surround a stone-lined pit where young
CIMMERIAN BOYS ages 12-15 stand Pollen drifts through the
air giving it an ethereal haze

At the center of the pit URAN an elder Cimmerian warrior
speaks

URAN
A Cimmerian warrior is like any
other man A Cimmerian warrior
feels hunger He feels cold Like
other men he may lie and cheat
(stares the boys down)
But when a Cimmerian warrior
hungers he hungers only for the
blood of his enemy When he feels
cold it is the cold steel of his
sword When he lies he lies in
wait for his enemy And when he
cheats he cheats death itself

Uran stops at the end of the line where a boy stands a good
two heads smaller than the rest He is no more than eight
but his face is as stoic driven

URAN (CONTD)
Conan You are too young to be
here Withdraw

CONAN determined doesnt move an inch The LARGEST TEEN
menacingly steps up to the smaller boy

LARGEST TEEN
He said leave motherless whelp

The hulking teen goes to shove Conan but Conan pulls his
arm

towards him lashing out with his other hand punching the

teen in the throat

The large boy goes down hard hands and knees gasping for
air

A smattering of LAUGHS erupt from the boys quickly silenced
by Urans stare Uran hands out RIVER STONES to each boy
ending with Conan The boys know what to do they put the
large stones in their mouths

URAN
In the black crag in the high pass
finds

stands a wooden training sword The

one who claims it with stone still

in his mouth will have earned the

right to train with the warriors
The boys look at each other sizing up the competition

URAN (CONTD)
Well What are you waiting for

And off they run They knock each other down punching the
others stomachs each trying to force the other to expel
their stones One or two succeed
Most of the remaining boys run for the trail that winds high
into the mountains But a few head right for the sheer cliff
face
Conan follows the ones headed to the cliff

CLIFF FACE
And when the Cimmerian boys climb it is a sight to behold
They find cracks we can barely see and scale the smooth rock

face as though it were a ladder

The hulking teen reaches for the same handhold as Conan
trying to knock him off Conan swings with one hand and

another path In moments he is ahead

EXT FOREST - DAY

Conan is in the lead as he crests the cliff top the bigger
boys right behind him

They race through the forest heading uphill --
When Conan spots movement ahead He pauses --

And the largest teen elbows past Conan into the lead The
boy runs two paces more and suddenly flies off his feet an
AXE lodged squarely in his forehead

All the boys stop Out of the dense forest come

FOUR PICTISH SAVAGES

Covered with fearsome war paint and armed with dual hand
He

axes the rotting heads of their enemies are slung at their
waist

The boys spit out the rocks in their mouths and YELL They
turn and run in the opposite direction

Only Conan doesnt move even as another boy pulls at him

CIMMERIAN BOY
Conan Run

But Conan simply pulls the axe from his large boys skull
turns to face the Picts his eyes burning
The Picts LAUGH and CHARGE CONAN

CUT TO

LATER

Corin arrives with Uran and other armed CIMMERIAN WARRIORS
They get a brief glimpse of a single PICT escaping in the
other direction One of the Cimmerians takes off in pursuit
Corin desperately searches for his son

CORIN
Conan Conan

Conan steps forward from out of a thicket his body covered
in Pict blood Three PICTS lie massacred the bodies hacked
to pieces

CORIN (CONTD)
What have you done boy

Conan walks past the other stunned Cimmerians up to his
father Conan SPITS OUT the bloody stone from his mouth

CONAN
They killed one I killed three I
am a warrior now

Uran and the other Cimmerian men exchange worried glances
Looking at the carved up bodies of the Picts they are
aghast Conan looks confused Why arent they happy

CORIN
A warrior What you have done a
jackal would do Never a warrior
on

CONAN
They would have done the same --

CORIN
As I said jackals

(TO URAN)
He is not ready I will forge him
myself

CUT TO

TRAINING MONTAGE
Conan is tested under Corins watchful eye

- Forced to sleep in the snow while his father keeps warm
inside

- A heavy boulder on his shoulder blades while he balances
wet river rocks

- Climbing a cliff face his bare hands leaving blood behind
on the jagged rocks

INT CIMMERIAN FORGE - DAY

Flames reflect in the blue eyes of Conan as he works the
bellows of the forge Sparks buzz like angry fireflies as he
stokes the blaze

Corin sharpens a sword perfecting it Conan cannot take his
eyes off it stepping away from the bellows

CORIN
Stoke your fire boy

Conan slams the bellows closed anger rising

CONAN
Stoke your fire chop your wood
I have slept where wolves dare not
I have balanced a thousand river
stones When will you teach me the
sword

Corin stares his son in the eyes Judging

Corin

CORIN
Think youre ready Then tell me
what is a swords purpose

CONAN
To slay ones enemies

CORIN
No That is what it does Its
purpose is why you use it

He tosses Conan two lumps of ore

CORIN (CONTD)
Tell me which makes the best
sword

Conan takes the two lumps testing them He hands his father
back one

CORIN (CONTD)
The stronger ore eh Then we shall
make a sword of it and tomorrow
you will show me what brute
strength yields

EXT FIELD - DUSK

With a setting sun silhouetting the two Conan attacks

Conan attacks with fury Corin defends with grace Until the
boy overextends and Corin slashes down a counterattack that

SHATTERS CONANS SWORD

Corin simply turns and walks away leaving Conan to puzzle
what happened

Corin lowers his sword and walks away leaving Conan to
puzzle what happened
INT CORINS FORGE - NIGHT

Conan works the bellows putting his back into it Corin
places both ores in the furnace where they begin to melt

CONAN
Why did it break
CORIN
Because it had no life

cut To

Sparks fly as Corin pounds on the glowing edge of the sword
with hammer Corin nods at Conan who sprinkles the glowing
blade with ash

CORIN (0S) (CONTD)

The strongest blade isnt made of
the hardest steel boy The hardest
ore is what a man will die for It
is strong and unyielding It
neither cowers nor concedes But
without the softer ore it can be
shattered like glass

cut To

Steam rises as Corin lowers the blade into a freezing slack
tub only to place it right back into the flames

CORIN (CONTD)
The softer ore is what a man lives
for It is flexible and lasting It
survives even against the greatest
of foes But too much of the soft
ore the blade will not cut deep
enough when it must

cut To

Corin fashions the blades hilt engraving the guard and
pommel It is a work of art

CORIN (CONTD)
A sword must be tempered the two
ores united through fire and ice
Through its suffering the sword
comes to hold both life and death

Corin hands Conan the sword
CORIN (CONTD)
Now tell me what is this swords

purpose

Conan furrows his brow trying to puzzle the answer He
reaches

cant Corins disappointment shows He takes the sword from
Conans hands

CORIN (CONTD)

This one is not ready yet

Blood rushes to Conans face but he says nothing He rushes
out

EXT MOUNTAIN LAKE - DAY

Frustrated Conan slashes through a field of reeds cutting
everything within reach of him expending his rage

Behind him something moves in the forest We catch just a
glimpse of the PICT the same one that escaped Conan in the
earlier scene

Conans instincts cause him to spin around -- but then
theres nothing there

INT CIMMERIAN SCOUT POST - DAY

Built into the side of a huge tree fifty feet up this
wooden structure houses two CIMMERIAN SENTRIES A BIRD CRIES

in the woods causing one of the sentries to investigate

THWICK He suddenly stands up straight unmoving The one
still sitting in the structure notices

CIMMERIAN SENTRY
See something

The standing sentry falls backwards revealing an ARROW
piercing his right eye Shocked the remaining sentry

for the WARNING HORN mounted on the wall

But as he reaches for it his shadow becomes three
dimensional MORPHING into

A SHADOW SCOUT
A thin feral humanoid bodies covered in tattoos from the
deepest jungles of Zingara The scout lashes out with his

black sword and cuts straight across the sentrys throat

This Shadow Scouts name is REMO
of

the

shaped

EXT SCOUT POST - DAY

Remo exits and stares down at CHEREN a BLIND ARCHER clad in
lamellar armor and a conical sedge hat Cheren has an arrow
notched and ready but somehow he knows not to fire

Cheren lowers his bow and lets out a BIRD WHISTLE --

And the forest comes alive The forces are an odd
combination massive KUSHITE TRIBESMEN dark-skinned savages
from the savannahs of Kush and a LEGION OF AQUILONIAN
MERCENARIES heavily armored knights drawn from the cities

Aquilonia
Their leaders respectively are the six foot-five Kushite

chief UKAFA gold-toothed his body painted for battle and
the handsome silver-armored Aquilonian LUCIUS

UKAFA
Thats the last of their guard
towers

LUCIUS

All this sneaking around for a
lowly tribe of barbarians

KHALAR SINGH (0S)

This lowly tribe of barbarians have
buried every warrior ever to set
foot on this land Lucius

KHALAR SINGH a warlord atop a black horse rides through

fog-shrouded trees

He bears a nomadic visage with tanned skin and almond-

eyes While his voice is calm his eyes burn with malice
LUCIUS

That is only because they have

never faced my legion

Khalar regards Lucius with amusement

KHALAR SINGH
Then show us But should you fail
lead

remember the plan

Lucius scowls as he delivers a bow to Khalar Singh

EXT CIMMERIAN VILLAGE - DAY

Corin walks out of the forge looking around for Conan
Various other Cimmerians go about the daily routine but
Conan is nowhere to be seen

CORIN
Conan

Corin looks to the ridge above the village noticing a thick
fog creeping in The fog curls and eddies something is out
there

Suddenly Lucius and his legion of silver-armored warriors
burst out of the fog attacking with speed and strength

But the Cimmerians are hardly caught flat footed In seconds
they are armed and they counter the charge with a furious
charge of their own

SLAM Sword and bone collide as the two enemy fronts smash
into each other And the battle devolves into one-on-ones --

Where the barbarians have the upper hand Uran and Corin
the main push of battle-frenzied barbarians as they swing

their huge broadswords extending their reach advantage over
the Aquilonians shorter weapons

And quickly the Aquilonians numbers are cut in half Corin
squares off against Lucius himself Lucius is sweating
Worried It wasnt supposed to be this hard

LUCIUS
Retreat

As a unit the Aquilonians race back into the woods In
seconds the Cimmerians give chase in wild pursuit

CORIN
Wait Hold your ground

But its too late nearly half the Cimmerian warriors are
gone on the chase
archers

Armed

EXT CLIFF FACE - DAY

Lucius and the Aquilonians race up to a sheer cliff face
Nowhere left to run They turn to see the Cimmerians
gathering in front of them

URAN
Death is in the air invaders Can
you taste it

LUCIUS
(SMILES )

Indeed I savor it

Uran notices something is wrong His eyes go skyward Atop
the cliff stand Cheren and a dozen more of his blind

bows at the ready with FLAMING ARROWS

They let the arrows fly streaking balls of flame heading
right for the Cimmerians But they do not hit them They hit
the tree trunks beside them

And for a moment the Cimmerians look relieved until they
notice small bags of a black substance tied to the arrows
The flames lick at the substance --

KABOOM The forest erupts into flames as the Cimmerian
warriors are burned alive

EXT MOUNTAIN LAKE - DAY

Conan spins started by the sound of the explosion He sees
flames rising above the treetops beyond

He races back home

EXT CIMMERIAN VILLAGE - DAY

Corin sees the flames in the distance as well Suddenly
Ukafa and his Kushite warriors erupt out of the forest

with fearsome barbed spears they charge the remaining
Cimmerians savage against savage

But the Kushites are not alone From behind the Cimmerians
wearing

reluctant

into

comes AKHUN a massive four hundred pounds of flesh

loops of chains like armor leads his turbaned TURANIAN
HORSEMEN into the village

The Cimmerian WOMEN arm themselves but the Horsemen attack
with NINE TAILED WHIPS pulling their swords from their hands
and dragging them to the ground

The Horsemen quickly gather up the women while Ukafa and his
men keep the Cimmerian warriors all too occupied

CONAN

Conan rushes through a river now tinged red with blood and
reaches the far end of the village

Huts burn women are chained only a handful of Cimmerians
still stand Lucius and his Aquilonian mercenaries are
helping the Spearmen slay the wounded

Conan grabs a fallen sword and rushes for the nearest
Aquilonian and RUNS HIM THROUGH A ZINGARAN spots him and
rushes him with his spear Conan readies himself for the

CHARGE --

When the Zingaran loses his head lopped off by Corins
blade

CONAN
Father

CORIN
Come

Corin sporting a deep gash to his abdomen pulls a

Conan from the battle back toward the forge

INT FORGE - DAY
The flames of the forge still burn as Corin pushes Conan
the room He bolts the door behind him

CONAN
Do we need more weapons
grating

leads

away

rising

Corin drops his sword then struggles to lift a heavy
in the dirt floor Beneath it a trough of cooling water
under the hut and away from the village

CORIN
Go There is a hunting lodge in the
North Pass with provisions

CONAN
No I will fight

Corin grabs Conan by his tunic pulling him up to his face
Corins eyes are half-crazed

CORIN
This fight is over but yours has
just begun You wanted to be a
warrior of the tribe Conan--now
you must be its last

CONAN
Father I am not afraid to die

CORIN
Good Make your death have purpose

BOOM Something slams at the door It does not budge Again
BOOM

A shadow appears under the door sliding into the forge and
MATERIALIZING into the form of Remo Remo quickly slides

the bolt

In rush enter Lucius and Ukafa Corin and Conan face their
attackers fighting in close quarters Lucius rushes at
Conan only for Conan to duck under his attack and --

THROW HIM IN THE FIERY FORGE Lucius SCREAMS in agony

up to reveal half of his formerly handsome face burned to a
crisp

Corin fights Ukafa to a standstill until Remo emerges from
the shadows behind him and drives a short sword into his

back

Corin falls to his knees
from

CONAN
No

Lucius delivers a massive backhand sending Conan flying

backwards -- and demolishing one of the Forges main support
beams

Half of the forge comes crashing down on top of Conan
pinning his bleeding form to the ground just a few feet

his fallen father

Enraged Lucius turns his anger to Corin raising his sword
to deliver the killing blow

KHALAR SINGH (0S)
I said I wanted a word with him

Lucius stays his hand as Khalar Singh steps into the forge
Beside him stands the PICT who escaped from Conan earlier
grinning from ear to ear

Khalar Singh hands him a bag of gold

KHALAR SINGH (CONTD)
As promised

PICT
(strange dialect -
SUBTITLED)
Their heads You promised me their

heads

KHALAR SINGH
All you wish once we are gone

The Pict nods and heads off drawing his knife Khalar Singh
stares down at Corin sizing him up

Corin lifts up into a sitting position back to the forge

KHALAR SINGH (CONTD)

I take no pleasure in this day
barbarian Your people are fierce
warriors deserving of every story
told of them But now you must
choose the story for yourself I am
Khalar Singh My army is handpicked
from the best Hyboria My second
to

Ukafa and his Kushite horde Remo
and his Shadow Scouts from the
jungles of Zingara And countless
others They all had a day like
this one They all chose a way
forward

Into the forge walks Cherin and Akhun
behind Corin eyeing Corin with malice

The lieutenants stand

Corin catches a glimpse of Conan buried but staring back at
him unable to move Corin quickly turns away careful not

give his son away

CORIN
What is it you want

KHALAR SINGH
I seek neither gold nor steel but
flesh and blood The last of a
royal line that goes back three
thousand years

Corin LAUGHS

CORIN
Royalty in Cimmeria Never Each
man is free here

KHALAR SINGH
But I seek a woman

Khalar looks outside the door of the forge The Cimmerians

women are being herded by the slavers

KHALAR SINGH (CONTD)

A queen in hiding Point her out
and youll spare the lives of your
own Perhaps even your wife

CORIN
My wife was killed long ago by
swine such as you

Khalar nods understanding

KHALAR SINGH
Then our stories began in the same
place Cimmerian I too lost my
wife to marauders How many men in
how many lands have suffered so
The only answer is power strength
unfettered the kind of which can
unite all Hyboria under a single
crown That is the legacy I seek
Will you join me

Its a powerful convincing speech But Corin holds his
tongue unmoved

KHALAR SINGH (CONTD)

Very well Then death will be your
story Your men will die And your
women too when I am done with
them None will survive to carry
your name forth and over time
even your enemies will forget you
ever were You will be wiped from
the pages of history

(to his men)

Take your blood but leave the
kill

One by one the lieutenants beat and stab Corin taking
pleasure in his pain

Conan struggles trying to move to yell to do anything
other than lie there But a huge timber lies upon his back
pinning him to the ground

KHALAR SINGH (CONTD)
Fariq Come

Entering the wrecked forge is FARIQ the six year old son to
Khalar Singh He stares at Corins bleeding form with the
dispassion of a sociopath

Khalar picks up THE SWORD Corin and Conan had forged
together the one Corin took away He admires it then hands
it to his son He keeps a hand on it as it is too heavy for
his son to lift alone He instructs his son as if teaching
him multiplication

KHALAR SINGH (CONTD)

Before you lies our enemy His
tribe waits for him in the beyond
What would you do

FARIQ
I would cut out his eyes father
so that he will not find them So
he will wander the afterlife
forever

Khalar smiles

KHALAR SINGH
Show me your strength Fariq
Without it you will never rule
With it you will never be
forgotten

Fariq DRIVES THE SWORD INTO CORINS EYE Corin doesnt make

sound Once Fariq has ripped out Corins eyes Khalar runs
Corin through

KHALAR SINGH (CONTD)
You have your desire Death has
found you

Corin spits out his last words also meant for Conan

CORIN
Soon -- it comes for you

CONANS POV

Conan glimpses around the faces of Khalar and his men each
image seared into his memory as if ablaze

KHALAR SINGH
Burn this place It no longer
exists

EXT CIMMERIAN VILLAGE - DAY

The forge is lit afire from a half dozen torches thrown
onto

its roof and inside its windows Khalar and the other watch

as the building roars into flame

INT FORGE - DAY

Smoke fills the air Conan struggles still unable to move
He COUGHS dying
burning

match

But then the fire collapses more of the forge and the
falling beams shatter the one that pins Conan to the ground

Slowly painfully Conan drags himself into the cooling
trough that runs beneath the hut

FADE TO BLACK

EXT CIMMERIAN VILLAGE - DAY
Conan exits the forge only to see the entire village
The bodies of everyone he has ever known litter the
landscape Nothing stirs Until he hears a strange CHOPPING
SOUND

THE PICT
Conan spots the Pict who is decapitating a dead Cimmerian
warrior adding to the collection of heads at his tattooed

waist

The Pict doesnt notice as Conan slips up behind him then
RUNS HIM THROUGH

As the wide-eyed Pict dies Conan takes the sword and CUTS A
NOTCH into his arm

DISSOLVE TO

NOTCHED ARM

Where there was once a single notch there are now FIVE such
notches on a much broader arm that struggles to pin another
powerful looking arm

INT BAR - MESSANTIA - NIGHT

A raucous bar on the Argossean waterfront Out the window we
see a port lined with Shemish galleys and junks from Kush

The bar is filled with the hearty sailors and merchants of
those ships and those who desire to part them from their
hard-earned money Zamoran thieves Hyborean mercenaries and
Brythunian whores Most of them watch the arm wrestling
taking place at the back of the bar

A pair of CITY GUARDS short swords sheathed at their sides
enter the bar and are immediately summoned over by the
harried BARKEEP

BARKEEP
Hes back there

The barkeep motion to the arm wrestlers

CITY GUARD 1
Whats this one done

BARKEEP
Whats he done What hasnt he
done Hes bedded six of my whores
and finished off three casks of
mead--and he hasnt paid so much as
a silver piece for it

CITY GUARD 1
So have your men deal with him

BARKEEP
I did

Behind the bar six men each hold down two HULKING MEN
YELLING in agony as their horribly broken arms are snapped
back into place

CITY GUARD 2
Sounds like a real problem Too bad
we have other places to be right
now

The Barkeep shakes his head knowing the routine He slips a
pair of silver pieces into the soldiers hand

BARKEEP
Just get that behemoth out of here

The two City Guards make their way to the back of the bar
His back to them the DRUNKEN MAN theyre after struggles to
pin his opponent cobras beneath each of their wrists ready
to strike at the loser A pair of voluptuous WHORES watch
caressing the Drunken Mans sinewy back

The Drunken Man YELLS in fury as he SLAMS the other mans
hand down upon the cobra which immediately bites its prey
As the soldiers arrive the drunken victor throws his
tankard
of ale at the Barkeep whos now back behind the bar

DRUNKEN MAN
Piss-water Youll serve my friends
and I your best barman or youll
taste steel

CITY GUARD 1
Time to leave northerner

The Drunken Man turns as the City Guard puts a hand on his

shoulder

CONAN

The gangly fifteen year old boy has grown into a powerfully
built man broad-shouldered with sun browned skin lined with
battle scars Only the piercing blue eyes and square cut

black mane remain from the boy we last saw

Conan stands to his full height looming over the smaller

City Guards who instinctively take a step back
CONAN

EXT STREET - NIGHT

Conan unconscious is dragged down the street by the two

City Guards

CITY GUARD 1
(STRUGGLING)
By the gods hes as heavy as a

CITY GUARD 2
Even a dead horse smells better
than this

EXT PRISON YARD - NIGHT

The City Guards drag Conan into a broad prison yard Many of
the INMATES are shackled together hacking with picks at the
rock walls on their work detail Those in no condition to
break rock are left in their own filth to rot Some are even
dead already the rats gnawing at the remains

INT PRISON GUARDHOUSE - NIGHT

The two City Guards drag Conan into the guardhouse where a
LIEUTENANT sits eating his dinner

The Lieutenant doesnt even bother to look up from his meal

LIEUTENANT
Whats the charge

CITY GUARD 2
Public drunkenness Another damn
hill ape who cant handle his
liquor

LIEUTENANT
Is that so boy How do you plead

Conan yawns in response One of the City Guards slaps Conan
hard across the face Conan slowly opens his eyes

CONAN
Wheres the Captain of the Guard

SCREAMS OF PAIN come from down the hall past a locked door

LIEUTENANT
In the cells interrogating a
prisoner And youll get the same
if you dont answer Youre accused
of public drunkenness How do you
plead

CONAN
In truth Ive been guilty of much
Jewels stolen from the crowns of
kings mens heads split in battle
for the price of a nights drink

But through that Ive searched and
waited and hunted my prey

Suddenly Conan shifts upright looking more sober than he
a moment ago

CONAN (CONTD)
But drink Havent had a drop all
night

The guards holding Conan up by his arms suddenly find those
arms wrapped around their heads Twist twist SNAP SNAP

breaks both their necks in an instant

The Lieutenant is horrified He goes for his sword Conan
bats it out of his hand slamming his head against the back
wall

CONAN (CONTD)

INT CELLS - NIGHT

A GUARD sits on a stool next to a heavy metal door Behind
him the CAPTAIN OF THE GUARD beats a chained ONE-EYED
PRISONER to a pulpy mess

Theres a KNOCK at the door

GUARD 1
What is it
keys

MUFFLED VOICE (0S)
Need to see the Captain

The Guard exhales frustrated He stands up getting his

out He stops Opens the small EYEHOLE to see into the other
room

The Lieutenant stares back at him

GUARD 1
Fine fine

He opens the door--

Only to see Conan standing there holding the decapitated
head of the Lieutenant

The shocked Guard goes for his sword Conan swings the
Lieutenants head smashing it into the Guards jaw and
putting him down for the count

Thats when the Captain of the Guard turns around And WE
RECOGNIZE HIM Hes LUCIUS the disfigured Aquilionian who
was one of Khalar Singhs lieutenants

LUCIUS
Men

From around a corner come five more Guards drawing their
weapons Lucius draws his as well

LUCIUS (CONTD)
Youve made a huge mistake ape
Youll never make it out of this
place

CONAN
I came for you Lucius

Lucius nods to the guards who advance on Conan

LUCIUS
You talk as though you know me

As recognition crosses Lucius face Conan springs into
action He KICKS the table at the men sending the knives

other torture implements flying right into the first guard

The second guard tries leaping over the falling table Conan
just grabs him in midair and throws him even faster into the
iron bands of the prisoner cells

Lucius lunges at Conan Conan steps in on him grabbing his
sword hand In a show of strength he twists Lucius own
sword until points down at the floor then THRUSTS IT

LUCIUS FOOT AND DEEP INTO THE WOOD FLOOR BELOW

Lucius BELLOWS in pain pinned to the spot

fq

The next three Guards rush forward forcing Conan to deal
with three weapons attacks at once

fq

The first to strike swings a mace and chain that wraps

Conans sword and he tries to yank it free from Conans

nstead Conan pulls him in a wide circle sending him

into a wall-mounted torch The guard burns like dry

The second to strike hits Conan on his sword hand carving a
deep gash and causing him to drop his sword

Conan turns to face him eyes filled with rage The guards
face goes pale Conan head butts him with all his might and

the guard goes down bleeding from mouth nose and ears

However the last Guard is upon Conan before he can react
The powerful soldier uses the shaft of his poleax to lift
Conan off his feet and back against the far wall pinned by
the neck

Conan struggles to breathe the polearm shaft driving his
throat into the wall The thickness of the Cimmerians neck
gives him time to reach into his bracer pulling out a
knife which he buries into the Guardsmans eye

Lucius SCREAMS in pain as Conan pours water on the burning
guard and lifts the table back onto its legs Then he pulls
the sword out of the floor a thick plume of blood rising

out
of Lucius now liberated foot
Conan takes Lucius face and smashes it against the table
Lucius looks aghast as Conan takes his injured hand and
places it over the torch flame searing the wound closed
The

Cimmerian never even bats an eye

LUCIUS
What do you want Who are you

Conan turns his face to the burnt side

CONAN
Im the one who made you pretty

LUCIUS
Impossible Youre dead

Conan shows Lucius the FIVE SCARS running down his forearm

CONAN
No I am death And I came a long
way for you

Conan lifts the sword

LUCIUS
Wait Wait
(CONAN PAUSES)
I can tell you where the rest are

CONAN
Where

LUCIUS
The end of the earth You kill me
and youll never find them

CONAN
Who are you offering

LUCIUS
Who do you think All of them
Ukafa Remo Cheren Akhun -- and

Khalar Singh himself But you have
to swear you wont kill me
Conan thinks about it

CONAN
You have my word You tell me where
I will find Khalar Singh and I
will not kill you

Conan lets Lucius go Lucius hobbles to his chair

LUCIUS
He is in a city called on the edge
of the Eastern Sea On the edge of
Hyboria Khor Khalba

Conan looks him in his eyes sizing him up He likes what he
sees In a flash Conan grabs Lucius head again yanking it
back exposing his throat

LUCIUS (CONTD)
You gave your word

Conan rips a SMALL KEY from a large keyring He drops it in

Lucius throat The big man chokes instantly A second
later

Conan pours ale from a flagon down his throat as well

Lucius swallows the key gasping for breath as Conan
releases
him

LUCIUS (CONTD)
What are you doing

CONAN
Toasting to our deal

Conan swings his sword and cuts the One Eyed Prisoner from
the wall

CONAN (CONTD)
Go You are free

One-Eye looks at his wrists and ankles still hobbled by
shackles

ONE-EYED PRISONER

I wont get far like this

Conan hands him a fallen Guardsmens sword
CONAN
The key to your shackles sits in
the Captains gut Happy hunting

The One-Eyed Prisoner grins with malice As he closes in on
the terrified Lucius Conan heads for the door

LUCIUS
Barbarian I had your word You
said you would spare my life

CONAN
No I said I wouldnt kill you

We hear Lucius SCREAMS OF PAIN as Conan walks out into the
night cutting another notch into his arm

EXT DESERT SANDSTORM - DAY

KHALAR SINGH looks older Worn He squints as he stares into
a howling sandstorm

UKAFA trudges through the deep sand to reach him The
sandstorm is so blinding we dont see him until he is less
than five feet away

UKAFA
halar Singh weve lost half our
cavalry legion and still Farig
presses on We must turn back

KHALAR SINGH
He says the Queen is here

UKAFA
He leads us in circles He knows
nothing of leading an army --

KHALAR SINGH
Take care Ukafa You holda
special place in my kingdom but
blood you are not

UKAFA
My apologies Khalar Singh I am
simply concerned for your army

REMO

Greek-

robes

swirling

KHALAR SINGH
And I would gladly sacrifice every
last man to get my hands on the
Queen And in that respect Farigq
has my confidence He knows more of
the legends of Acheron than anyone

Suddenly two forms race at them from the blinding sand

and FARIQ No longer a child Fariq is now a man in his
twenties but he is hardly the strong warrior his father is
His frame is slight his eyes beady

FARIQ

Father they are here The hidden

oasis just as it was written
Khalar Singh looks to Remo for confirmation The misshapen
and shadowy Remo nods

EXT CAVE TUNNEL - DAY

Remo and Fariq lead Khalar and Ukafa into a natural tunnel
carved out of rock Inside the sandstorm no longer rages

And on the other side of the tunnel --

EXT OASIS - CONTINUOUS
A protected rock oasis heavy vegetation crawling up the
encircling cliff walls herds of sheep grazing on fields of

grass At its far end beyond a deep blue pond lies a

influenced monastery and several tiled-roof mud-brick
houses

And moving between the pools are MEN and WOMEN going about
their simple chores They wear long flowing white linen

and turbans
The air and sand are perfectly still within the perimeter of
the oasis But beyond it the sandstorm rages all around

sand hurled violently hundreds of feet into the air

around the oasis as though it were the eye of some mystical
hurricane protected by an unseen force

A row of robed YOUNG WOMEN kneel in front of one of the
Ilira

reflecting pools quietly reading from prayer books and
softly striking their right breast with a left hands wrapped
in thorns

One girl ILIRA mischievously taps the shoulder of the girl
next to her with her thorn The girl TAMARA squeals in
pain angry her prayer was interrupted

Ilira is the fun-loving dilettante of the relationship
Tamara the studious good girl

TAMARA
Stop it Im trying to pray

ILIRA
Im bored

TAMARA
Then hit yourself

Tamara hits Ilira back with her thorn Ilira SQUEALS then
hits a grinning Tamara back Tamara grabs her but as they
TUSSLE--

FASSIR (0S)
Is that how one shows penitence

Both girls instantly stop as FASSIR appears behind them
Fassir is an elder monk and leader of the monastery He
shakes his head both out of fondness and disappointment

FASSIR (CONTD)
expect more from a queen

ILIRA
m sorry Fassir I just tire of
saying the same prayer every day

FASSIR

Then you should be able to
translate it from its original
Acheronian

Iliras face scrunches unsure Tamara steps in to help

save face

TAMARA
Of course she can She even taught
it to me Never again
FASSIR
Go on

TAMARA
Never again will we stand by as
darkness consumes the world Never
again will innocents suffer for
others power Never again will the
Queen suffer so Acheron may rise

FASSIR
Very good Tamara You must have
taught her very well indeed Ilira

A smile on Fassirs face confirms he knows the truth

Suddenly the monasterys BELL RINGS OUT A moment later a
temple EXPLODES in flames

Pouring out from the swirling sands come Khalar Singhs

army

Cheren and his archers stand atop Khalars

MAN OF WAR

A massive siege engine atop which CHEREN and his archers
fire

FLAMING ARROWS The arrows arc down and explode as they

impact the tiled roofs

Sitting at the highest point of the Man Of War Khalar Singh

likes what he sees

CHAOS

The monks scatter in every direction but wherever they
turn

more troops burst out of the swirling sand

A small handful of armed MONKS display acrobatic martial
arts

prowess as they battle with Khalars heavily armed forces
but they are vastly outnumbered

Fassir grabs Tamara
FASSIR (CONTD)

The Queen must not be captured
Take her out the North Gate
reforms

Quickly

Tamara grabs Ilira and pulls her through the flaming
battleground Zingaran warriors cut down the monks while
Turanian horsemen concentrate on the women

ILIRA
We cant leave them

TAMARA
If you are caught everything we
live for is lost

WHIP A whip encircles Iliras waist A massive TURANIAN
pulls her to him Tamara grabs the whip pulling Ilira the
other way But she is no match for the huge slaver He yanks
on the whip pulling both of them to him --

Only then does he notice Tamaras unsheathed knife which she
plunges into his throat

She frees Ilira and they run

INT NORTH PASSAGE - CONTINUOUS

A thin alleyway at the rear of the monastery leading away
from the din of battle towards a rear gate of the oasis

Tamara and Ilira run for the gate only for the shadows of
the alleyway to move and shift -- REMO and three of his
shadow scouts

They advance on the women drawing dark shortswords

REMO
No swords Khalar needs them alive

TAMARA
Good to know

Tamara lunges for the nearest shadow scout with her knife
but when she strikes she hits nothing but shadow It

behind her and grabs her

Another grabs Ilira Tamara launches her body into the air
executing a backflip that puts her behind the shadow scout

quick knife strike and he goes down
looming

And with one continuous motion she vaults over the shadow
scout holding Tamara cutting his throat as well

Remo and the remaining scout give chase blending in and out
of shadows But each time they strike Tamara defends Ilira
They near the far end of the alleyway the North gate

ahead with the desert beyond

Remo blends into another shadow --

EXT MAN OF WAR - CONTINUOUS

Remo materializes out of a shadow atop the Man Of War next
to Cheren the archer

REMO
The north gate Destroy it

Cheren and the other archers turn their fire to the gate at
the end of the passage They fire a volley of fiery arrows

INT NORTH GATE - CONTINUOUS

Tamara and Ilira run for the whirling sands just ahead --
when the flaming arrows land before them

Ilira hesitates

TAMARA
Run

ILIRA
Well die

TAMARA

Well die if we stay

She locks eyes with Ilira who nods Together they run right
for the arrows

But at the last minute Ilira falters She falls to the
ground

Tamara turns to see Ilira lying in the gateway a moment too
late
gateway

behind

THE ARROWS EXPLODE causing a cave in that closes the

EXT SANDSTORM - CONTINUOUS

Tamara falls to the sand as the gate collapses behind her
She looks back only to see that Ilira didnt make it

TAMARA
No

EXT MAN OF WAR - CONTINUOUS

Khalar Singh stares at the cloud of destruction at the north
tunnel

There one form hurries into the swirling sandstorm

KHALAR SINGH
Who was guarding that gate

REMO
It was I Lord

KHALAR SINGH
Take four legions Hunt her Before
I hunt you

EXT DESERT - DAY

Tamara stumbles through a stretch of barren wasteland the

plumes of the oasis sandstorm now off in the distance

her

The sun mercilessly beats down upon her face her lips are
already chapped She falls to her knees unable to go on

She looks up as the heat streams off the desert floor

creating a swirling mirage Through which the silhouette of

rider appears followed by others

SLAVER CARAVAN
The horse-drawn carts of the caravan are lined with iron
bars and behind the bars are a bevy of young women mostly
looking worse for wear

The HEAD SLAVER rides ahead and walks up to the heap of
white cloth that is Tamara

TAMARA
Water -- please --

He lifts her barely conscious head eyeing her features a
greasy paw examining her body He smiles

HEAD SLAVER
The gods are good

EXT OASIS - NIGHT

The Man of War dominates the center of the oasis its
torches

illuminating the scene before it Akhun and the Turanians

hold chains connected to the twenty women monks kneeling

with their wrists chained to their neck collars

In front of them kneels Fassir beaten and bloodied

Khalar Singh Fariq and Ukafa step down from the Man of
War

Fariq carries with him a large iron box with ornate carvings

on it

KHALAR SINGH
All these years searching the ends
of the earth And here you are
Just a two day ride from Khor
Kalba I can scarcely believe it

FASSIR
(in Acheronian to monks)
Say nothing

KHALAR SINGH
(IN ACHERONIAN)
Yes Say nothing Maybe he doesnt
know who we are Maybe hes not
looking for the Queen

Several of the women look up at him shocked

KHALAR SINGH (CONTD)

Thats right my brethren you have
been lied to all your lives Told
you must hide yourselves told you
were alone I want you to look at
me and see me for what I am A
brother A friend I have come not
to hurt you but liberate you

FASSIR
You come for your own dark
purposes to raise Acheron

KHALAR SINGH
Yes I come to resurrect the
greatest empire Hyboria has ever
known

FASSIR
An empire of evil soaked in blood
sacrifice and the blackest of
magic

Khalar Singh becomes infuriated eyes blazing

KHALAR SINGH
Have you hidden from the world so
long that you cannot to see Blood
magic death it is everywhere
Acheron is no different than any
other kingdom but for its glory
(MORE)

KHALAR SINGH (CONTD)

And in place of that glory you
offer shame I knew shame but that
was before I was shown my true
lineage

Khalar draws closer to the women looking them each in the
eye

KHALAR SINGH (CONTD)
When I was but a child raiders
destroyed my village cut our
fathers to ribbons and burned our
women as sacrifice to foreign gods
Those few who survived we ran for
our lives chased into caves at the
edge of the Eastern Sea left with
nothing to live for But then we
discovered it Acheron The temple
that spawned an empire We learned
that we were not broken goat-
herders on a desolate coastline We
were the sons and daughters of
kings

(stares in Iliras eyes)

And queens

He motions to Fariq who brings the iron box forward

KHALAR SINGH (CONTD)

For thirty years I have searched
for you In that time I built both
an army and empire but they are
nothing compared to what we can
create together We can raise
Acheron again Never again will we
hide like rats Never again will we
watch as our loved ones are
slaughtered I call forth the
Queen Stand and join me and this
day will have a joyous end

No one moves

FASSIR
You would have all the world
suffer as you have suffered We
will die before we help you

KHALAR SINGH
Yes You will

He nods to his son He paces in front of the female monks
the box in front of them

FARIQ
The caves beneath Khor Khalba
contain all manner of creature
many -- altered -- by centuries of
blood magic But one in
particular has developed a special
connection to the blood A thirst
It is said that only the Queen of
Acheron itself can resist its
embrace

He stops one woman away from Ilira
FARIQ (CONTD)
So what say you Will you be the
lucky one or will you tell me who

is

A tear falls down her face but she stays silent Theres

the
sound of SLITHERING as Fariq opens the box She stares down
inside the box --
AND SCREAMS
CUT TO
TAMARA
She awakens to the SCREAMING of a whipped SLAVE GIRL
EXT DESERT - DAY
Tamaras eyes are met by a dozen others SLAVES of every
color chained together with her in a CAGED WAGON The SLAVE
TRADER swings his whip twice more hitting the cowering
women

in the cage

SLAVE TRADER
Wake up slags Smile A new owner
approaches

Tamara makes eye contact with the Slave Trader

TAMARA
Let me go I promise youll be
rewarded

The Trader just laughs leering at her

SLAVE TRADER
And I would sample that reward
fair one but you wear white

SLAVE TRADER (CONTD)

Tell me have the stars aligned and
delivered a virgin slave into my
care

He eyes her lasciviously Tamara turns away and does not
answer

SLAVE TRADER (CONTD)

No matter Ill know soon enough
(TURNS AWAY)

Good day sir A lone rider in a

desolate land The perfect customer

for what I sell

CONAN

Rides out of the sun his massive form silhouetted by the
bright desert sky He stares at the slave wagons

SHEMISH WOMAN
Please master Your gold can free
me from this hole I can bring you

PLEASURE--

The Slave Trader immediately WHIPS her incensed

SLAVE TRADER
Silence whore

The Slaver goes to whip her again but before the blow can
fall Conan grabs his arm The Slave Trader looks furious

but Conans size holds him back

CONAN
Khor Kalba Which way

SLAVE TRADER

This is the road to Khor Kalba

Ahead Past the Great Wall

The Slaver nods to the east and Conan releases his arm

The Slaver continues whipping the slave Conan just rides on
- not his problem
But as Conan passes Tamara for a brief moment their eyes
meet Something about her Conan stares a moment then spurs

his horse on

Just then the ground around them RUMBLES Horses rear the
Tamara

tulwars

women SCREAM Conan turns and looks up His eyes go wide

ENORMOUS BOULDERS

Coming thundering down the hills on all sides The SLAVERS
see them a moment to late

SLAM Several of the horses and carts are smashed by the
rolling boulders

Conan kicks his horse trying to outrace the boulders But
when the wagon next to him is hit its axle spears his horse

in its side and Conan goes down

Pissed he draws his sword The Slavers scramble around the
broken wagons in chaos

Only a pair of wagons still stands One of them holds
CONAN
Use your whips on the horses legs
The Slavers are confused Then they notice
TURANIAN HORSEMEN
racing down the hill behind the boulders
As the riders bear down upon the slavers the Slavers do as
theyre told entangling the legs of the first wave of
horses throwing their riders
More than a few riders SNAP their necks as theyre driven
into the desert floor The remainder fight hand to hand and
are cut down by either Conans blade or the slavers
But their victory is short lived --
As a SECOND WAVE OF RIDERS comes thundering towards them
before the Slavers can re-establish their perimeter The
riders start cutting the slavers down where they stand
CONAN
Conan lodges his sword in a still-rolling boulder As it
rolls it pulls him up on top of it From this height Conan

launches himself down at the horsemen below

WHAM He knocks a rider off his horse Conan landing square
see

hes

in the saddle He kicks the horse straight at the other
riders They dont see him coming until its too late He
cuts them down where they sit

The last remaining CARAVAN DRIVER whips his horse team
trying to pull his wagon out of the fight Conan spins to

a FLASH of steel and the riders neck plumes in blood as
decapitated

Which is strange since the cavalry are nowhere near the
wagon

REMO

The explanation comes as the shadow behind the driver MORPHS
into Remo the spindly Shadow Scout He takes the reins
stopping the wagon

Conan spots him recognition in his eyes

CONAN (CONTD)
You

Theres a SCREAM Conan turns to see the other two SHADOW
SCOUTS already hacking their way through the slaves on one

the caged wagons A Shadow Scout gets to Tamara only to
her FIGHT BACK
Tamara kicks the first Scout in the face slamming his head
into the bars However the second one clubs her unconscious
from behind

CONAN
Leaps from his horse launching his body at Remo Remo dives
and rolls away Small and misshapen he is nonetheless very
fast

Conan strikes again Again Remo dodges out of the way

The Shadow Scouts draw swords but Remo waves them off
speaking in the broken language of a savage

REMO
The girl Bring her to Khalar
Scouts

sprawled

Conan launches an all out attack Remo leaps over his sword
and vaults Conan landing on his back He draws his sword
preparing to cut Conans throat --

When Conan hurls his body backwards into one of the huge
rolling boulders The impact crushes Remo and he loses his
grip

Conan spins to strike again only to see Remo MELT INTO THE
SHADOW OF THE BOULDER

Conan turns his attention towards the other two Shadow

as they drag the unconscious Tamara away

Conan mounts one of the cavalry horses and gallops towards
the Scouts They see him coming and let go of Tamara THEY
MELT AWAY INTO HER SHADOW AND DISAPPEAR

TAMARA

Dazed she struggles to her feet Conan appears beside her
his dagger out Tamara gasps in fear but Conan only reaches
out and breaks the lock on her chains

CONAN
Who are you

TAMARA
I am nobody

He cuts the bonds on her feet Tamara rises up the battle
scene revealed to her

Dead bodies of the Slavers and Turanian horsemen lie

in every direction Tamara takes in the gruesome sight
shocked

CONAN
Many died to capture nobody
(motions to his horse)
Get up

TAMARA
And if I dont wish to ride with
you
EXT DESERT - DAY

Conan rides his horse Tamara trailing on foot wrists
tethered to Conans saddle by a long rope Tamara looks
exhausted

They reach a gallery of broken columns spires of fossilized
coral that juts out of the desert

TAMARA
Stop I want water

Conan just keeps riding

CONAN
Perhaps the slavers took your
orders I dont

TAMARA
I never knew men could be so cruel
Now I wonder if the world is filled
with animals such as you

CONAN
You speak of animals as if they
were less than men But animals
dont stab their brothers in the
back or steal their mothers only
possession And they never lie

TAMARA
I havent lied

Conan get off his horse unties Tamara and gives her a water
sack Tamara greedily drinks down the water

CONAN
Very well Give me your name

TAMARA
I am Tamara Amelia Karushan And
you

CONAN
I am Conan

TAMARA

Conan Thats it
windmills

CONAN
What more names do I need

Conan then grabs Tamara around her waist putting her atop
his horse He then mounts behind her their bodies close
Conans mouth is only inches from her ear as he speaks

CONAN (CONTD)
There is only one truth I need from
you Tamara Amelia Karushan Why
does Khalar Singh want you

Tamara looks away but doesnt respond

CONAN (CONTD)
Then lets hope its for your
cooking

EXT CAMPFIRE - NIGHT
A campfire amidst several large boulders a line of

on the horizon

Tamara struggles to manage a cooking pot over a blaze Conan
comes over and smells the pot his face scrunches from the
odor

CONAN
Trying to poison me

Tamara steps back and gets down on her knees her hands
clasped

CONAN (CONTD)
What are you doing

TAMARA
Before we eat I must pray

CONAN
Crom What would you pray for That
a bone may not get stuck in your
throat No words nor gods will give
you one more moment than fate
allows you

TAMARA
Then you have no faith And I am
sorry for you

CONAN
I need no pity

TAMARA
But you do You live in a world
that is harsh and short Where fate
is unyielding and hope is a cruel
joke I live in a world with a
purpose that guides me where faith
sustains me

Suddenly Conan KICKS DIRT PAST TAMARA ONTO THE FIRE The
fire goes out plunging everything into darkness

TAMARA (CONTD)
Why did you--

Suddenly theres the sound of FIGHTING Grunting blows
being interchanged then a LOUD SNAP AS BONES ARE BROKEN

A moment later the flames of the fire are stoked up again
revealing Conan standing over the groaning REMO The other
two SHADOW SCOUTS are dead

Tamara instinctively jumps back

CONAN
Dont worry His back is broken He
wont be slinking away this time

As Tamara gapes at Remo Conan simply pulls the cooking pot
off the fire

CONAN (CONTD)
Now lets eat

TAMARA
But -- what about him

Remo GROANS in pain

CONAN

As we pass one of the faces again we hear the sound of a

We GLIDE DOWN past hundred foot high pillars of flames

The streets of Acheron are lined with thousands of SLAVES
young and old chained together toiling under the lash of
their cruel masters the

Towering over the slaves the warriors are a fearsome sight
Their armor crafted from the bones of their defeated
enemies rises to a mask which covers much of their

grotesque surface of the pyramid becomes clearer one hewn
from cracked bone and empty sockets

The wreckage of old siege equipment dots the hillside before

An aging catapult looks down upon the wall below Slowly it
begins to turn

Conan pushes the catapult until it aims towards the Great
Wall

We hear MUFFLED SCREAMS and find Remo tied to a boulder
cradled in the catapult Conan pulls the gag out of Remos
mouth

EXT BRIDGE TO NOWHERE - NIGHT

Conan returns from the nearby hills carrying a pair of
rabbits hes hunted and skinned

He looks around surprised not to find Tamara He hears a
yelp from nearby and walks to a dirt path beyond the
clearing
TAMARA

Shes tied up and gagged and shes wormed her way this far
muddying and scraping herself all along the way She lets

out
a frustrated grunt as Conan simply picks her back up and
carries her back to the outcropping

He pulls the gag from her mouth and drops a skinned rabbit
at

her feet

CONAN
Here Eat

Tamara squirms away from the carcass disgusted

TAMARA
Couldnt you at least cook it
first

CONAN

Fire draws attention

Conan tears into his rabbit chewing on the raw meat

TAMARA
Does it bother you blood on your
hands

CONAN

The only blood on these hands I
claimed with my own sword

TAMARA
What does that mean

CONAN
Clean hands mean nothing Kings and
Queens claim more lives than I will
ever meet and not a drop is
spilled in their presence

TAMARA
What are you talking about Ive
done no harm to you Ive done no
harm to anyone

Conan confronts her enraged
CONAN
You lie You are the very reason my
people are dead

TAMARA
Are you mad I never met your
people

CONAN
But Khalar Singh has He destroyed
my people looking for you

Suddenly Tamara understands

TAMARA
The one who came for us His name
is Khalar Singh

CONAN
You know this

TAMARA
We did not know who sought us only
that we were sought

CONAN
You hid from him And while you
did others died in your place

TAMARA
If we did not hide countless more
would have been killed You do not
know what purpose he has for our
queen

CONAN
And I do not care for he will not
live to see it bear fruit

Tamara is shocked

TAMARA
Wait -- you seek to kill this
Khalar We have the same aim He
takes my queen to Khor Kalba I
have sworn an oath to protect her
I can help you

Enough lies
Conan puts the gag back in her mouth and binds her hands

EXT ROCK RIDGE - NIGHT

Conan watches the Great Wall silently absently playing with
a DAGGER in his hand as he gauges the many guardposts along
the wall The archers The barrels of oil The cavalry

He feels eyes upon him and looks down at Tamara still bound
and gagged her eyes burning holes in his forehead Conan
pulls out her gag

CONAN
You will keep quiet

TAMARA

What use is talking You wont
believe a word I speak I only want

to know this -- how will you kill
Khalar You are too big to play the
assassin

CONAN

You will be the lure that will draw
me close Then I will scale the
wall and cut him down where he
stands

TAMARA
And the archers and cavalry They
will be napping

CONAN
They will not be a problem

Tamara thinks about it

TAMARA
No Not good enough

Conan is shocked by her brazen response

CONAN
Did I ask

TAMARA
Should you fail Ill be left
without a weapon helpless in my
enemies hands Let me help Conan
Conan responds by putting the gag back in her mouth

CONAN
I will not fail

But still Tamara glares at him -- and we can see the hint of
Conans resolve bending

DISSOLVE TO

EXT GREAT WALL - DAY

Khalar Singh stands atop the wall awaiting Conan Farigq
draws close

FARIQ
Let me take care of this thief

father Hes beneath your notice

KHALAR SINGH
He killed Remo likely his cavalry
legion as well Whatever he is he
is more than a mere thief

Then off in the distance at the far edge of the desert
clearing two figures step out from amongst the boulders

CONAN AND TAMARA

Conan holds a squirming but bound Tamara

CONAN
Be still

Conan thrusts Tamara in Khalars direction
CONAN (CONTD)
(yelling to Khalar)
I have what you want Wheres my
gold

Khalar reaches down and lifts a heavy sack of gold coins

KHALAR SINGH

RIGHT

Triple your price Come and claim
it

GATES OF THE WALL - MOMENTS LATER

The gates open and Khalar strides out into the clearing
CONAN AND TAMARA

stand a hundred feet ahead

KHALAR SINGH (CONTD)
Send her to me

CONAN
Send the gold

Khalar Singh throws the gold sack It lands halfway between
them He sends Tamara ahead her mouth gagged

But the moment Tamara reaches the gold --
From out underneath the sand FOUR HORSEMEN rise up out of
the desert floor They each bear weighted nets and spiked

lances and they surround Conan

The first rider gallops towards Conan who simply LOPS OFF

HORSES FRONT LEGS As the beast collapses Conan crushes the
riders skull with his broadsword

The next two riders attack together but Conan dodges their
nets and rips away one of their spears only to lodge it

the other riders chest He dives at and tackles the first
rider TOPPLING HIM ALONG WITH HIS HORSE He snaps the

second riders neck

The last rider comes at Conan who horizontally slashes

THROUGH THE HORSES NECK AND THEN THE RIDERS NECK Both
human and animal head tumble to the desert floor

All four riders are dead in a matter of seconds
KHALAR
Smiles Hes got Tamara by the neck

KHALAR SINGH
who

Conan

Youre fast But are you fast
enough

Conans eyes go to the top of the wall where CHEREN and his
archer prepare to fire Conan rushes forward as the flaming
arrows stream toward him

EXPLOSIONS rip through the air where Conan was throwing up
huge dust cloud

Conan bursts out of the dust cloud lunging in an attack

But Khalar Singh is not there He has withdrawn inside the
gates

Baring his teeth Conan runs at the wall itself
Cheren and the archers let loose another volley at Conan
evades and strikes away the falling arrows with his sword

Explosions fill the air but none of them scorch Conan as he
REACHES

THE GREAT WALL

Conan hits the base of the wall at full stride like a
mountain lion Reaching out he launches himself up taking
half the vertical of the wall in a single leap

Digging his hand into the seam of the wooden beams he stops
only to vault up again taking the forty foot wall in two
upward bounds

WALL WALK

Conan leaps upon wall walk the passageway atop the Great
Wall

FARIQ
Tries to hide his surprise Even as he draws his sword
takes out the four SOLDIERS in his way

FARIQ

You should have run while you
could
blade

Khalar

have

Conan looks at the sword It strikes a chord in him IT IS
THE SWORD HIS FATHER FORGED Enraged Conan charges the
slight Fariq

Fariq partially parries the attack Hes obviously well-
trained but hes no match for Conan The tip of Conan

cuts a large gash in Fariqs cheek

KHALAR SINGH
Fariq

Khalar Singh arrives grabbing his son by his collar and
flinging him away from the barbarian Fariq struggles to
stand trying in vain to hide his embarrassment

Conan and Khalar Singh size each other up on the narrow wall
walk

CONAN
I was wondering what it would take
for you to stop cowering

KHALAR SINGH
I wasnt cowering I was studying
Youre quite gifted with a sword
but its not from schooling Your
speed and power makes up for a lack
of -- finesse Ive seen such
fighting before -- Cimmerian

Enraged Conan charges Khalar Singh He swings down on

Singhs head only when the sword reaches it it finds
nothing but air Khalar is fast

KHALAR SINGH (CONTD)
Cimmerian it is Now it makes
sense You came for blood not
gold

Conan responds by lunging in swinging his broadsword in a

broad arc with all his might Even in the small space
Khalars lateral speed is dizzying He sidesteps Conans

attack and backhands Conans face with the flat of his
tulwar

Conans resolve wavers momentarily knowing Khalar could

just as easily sliced his throat
KHALAR SINGH (CONTD)

Your people barely afforded me a
challenge Youre little more than
beasts

Conan comes at Khalar with twice as much fury smashing
entire posts as he hacks at the warlord who simply evades
the attack

Down the wall walk they move Conan attacking while Khalar
seems complacent enough just to defend

KHALAR SINGH (CONTD)
Youve come a long way barbarian
only to fail

Khalar ducks Conans last wild swing and gashes Conan twice
both deeply in his midsection Khalar then KICKS Conan
sending the Cimmerian slamming onto the rock parapet

CRUNCH Conan lands directly on his back his sword
clattering away from him Khalars men back away into a
circle Conan struggles to get on all fours

Khalar KICKS Conan in his shattered chest lifting Conan off
the ground with his might He follows up with a devastating
punch to Conans face one which lands like a piledriver
CRUNCH

Conan can only bleed as Khalar looms over him

KHALAR SINGH (CONTD)

So much for vengeance

(to his soldiers)

Get me oil -- and a torch

Soldiers quickly bring over a bucket of oil and a lit torch

KHALAR SINGH (CONTD)

Is that really the best you could
do Is that as far as you could
think ahead Just rush in and kill
me

Behind Khalar Singh Conan spots Tamara being brought up
her

hands bound Her eyes show an intense fear but resolve as

well
TAMARA HANDS

Between the bonds she slips down a blade Its CONANS
DAGGER She quickly cuts her bonds

With all the attention focused on Conan no one is quick
enough to stop her as GRABS THE TORCH FROM THE SOLDIER
LIGHTING THE ARROWS IN CHERENS QUIVER

Cheren spins around sees the flames reaching his pitched
arrows

CHEREN
No

But its far too late Tamara hits the floor beside Conan
BOOM

EXPLOSION

The blast sends parts of Cheren flying in every direction
Ukafa Fariq and the wall guards are flattened by the
concussion

Khalar Singh who was standing closer to the explosion is
THROWN AGAINST THE WALL

KHALAR SINGH

The warlord slowly rises his head pounding from the
explosion He looks up The entire parapet is on fire

He grits his teeth and climbs the wall
ATOP THE WALL

A thick wall of flame rages before Khalar Conan and Tamara
are gone He looks over the far side of the wall where two
figures on horseback ride off into the distance Tamara
holding Conan atop the horse

Ukafa and Fariq rise and see what Khalar Singh sees

KHALAR SINGH
Ukafa you will take half our
forces North to the Sea I will
take the rest South

FARIQ
What of me father

KHALAR SINGH
You will return to Khor Kalba You
will feed the women to the beast
until you find our Queen

FARIQ
I will not I will track the
barbarian with you --

Enraged Khalar Singh grabs him by the back of his head
pulling him in close

KHALAR SINGH
You think I care what you wish
You want to play warrior It is not
in you One day you will be king
but warlord never

FARIQ
I can Let me prove it to you

KHALAR SINGH
You will not risk your life again
You are my line my successor You
will not throw away all that I have
worked for

A smile creeps up on Ukafas face watching Fariqs
embarrassment He withdraws hastily all eyes on him

KHALAR SINGH (CONTD)

(without looking at Ukafa)

If I find you smiling before you
bring me the girl I will take
every tooth I see

Ukafa buries the smile as Khalar turns to the wall of flames
left in Conans wake

INT CORINS FORGE - NIGHT
The flames become the blaze of the forge

CORIN (0S)
More wood boy We must test the
steel with our fire
pulling

Conan a young boy again kneels beside the woodpile

OUT LOGS--

But when he hands them to his father he notices his father
is covered with sword wounds cut and bleeding

CORIN (CONTD)
What are you waiting for The fire
is dying

Conan turns back to the wood pile Instead of wood the pile
is full of the bodies of those he recently killed Lucius

Remo etc

The young Conan struggles to push the first body onto the
forge Still the fire diminishes

Conan turns and there is no more wood And no more bodies

CONAN
Its not enough Ive failed you
father

CORIN

It will never be enough Conan

CONAN
I dont understand --

He spins Behind him TAMARA stands a look of sadness on her
face

CORIN
Through suffering you will learn
your purpose boy And you have not
begun to suffer yet

INT ROOM - NIGHT

Conans eyes pop open He inhales sharply gripped by the
dream

The room is dark surrounded by thick draperies Conan lies
on a straw bed with white sheets soaked through with his

sweat He looks to his wounds all bandaged

He rises--a bit too fast because he falls back to his bed
TAMARA
I wouldnt move so fast I bound
your wounds as best I could but
Im no healer

Conan looks over to discover Tamara sitting nearby

CONAN
Where am I

TAMARA
On the Wasp You told me where it
laid just before you passed out
Though I cant say as I feel much
safer here

Conans response is to rise again his face contorting in
pain

TAMARA (CONTD)
Dont embarrass me with thanks I
only saved your life

CONAN
You were -- adequate

Conan pulls aside one of the thick draperies that surround
his bed Behind it lies a staircase which he ascends

EXT ZINGARAN GALLEY - NIGHT

Conan steps out onto the deck of a sixty-foot djunk
traveling quickly down a wide and powerful river

ARTUS
Look what we have here A hill ape
in over his head

Conan spins to see the rough brightly dressed Zamoran
pirate
ARTUS leaping down from the quarterdeck his sword out

The other ZAMORAN PIRATES draw near as well Tamara sees the
scene suddenly uncomfortable

CONAN
I was just wondering what that
smell was
(sniffs near Artus)
Now I know

ARTUS
We take no stowaways Only paying
passengers Youve best be laden
with gold

CONAN
If its metal you seek perhaps
youd settle for steel

In a flash Conans sword lunges forward CLANG It meets
Artuss sparking as they collide Artus LAUGHS

CONAN (CONTD)
Still fast Artus

ARTUS
Fast deadly charming rakishly
handsome
(to the pirates)
All hail Conan

PIRATES
All hail Conan

Artus slaps his hand on Conans back and Conan winces in
pain

ARTUS
Sorry friend Looks like youve
had a rough road

CONAN
It wont get easier Khalar Singh
lives Hell be coming for me and

the girl

ARTUS
Good Were scrapping for a fight
these days

CONAN

This one may be more than you wish
I need you to get me close to Khor
Kalba

Artus rubs his beard

ARTUS
Rest up Well get you there

Conan withdraws to his room

INT ROOM - NIGHT
Conan collapses on the bed as Tamara follows him inside

TAMARA
We go to Khor Kalba

CONAN
I do

Conan puts a brawny arm over his tired eyes

TAMARA
No We do

CONAN
Just leave me to sleep

But Tamara doesnt leave forcing Conan to respond

CONAN (CONTD)
You would risk your life for
royalty Why

Tamara pauses realizing she must trust Conan to gain his
help

TAMARA
Because she represent freedom not
just ours but all Hyborias What
do you know of Acheron

CONAN
A tall tale Meant to scare
children

TAMARA

It is no fable Its my peoples
history Acheron was an empire that
swallowed all of Hyboria led by
the King and his legion of demon
warriors Unstoppable Insatiable
Immortal But still it had one
weakness For the true power of
Acheron laid not with its King but
the Queen Every twenty years a
new queen from the royal line would
be coronated with a crown of iron
Spikes would pierce her slowly
drain her precious blood and
through her suffering Acheron would
remain invincible Until one of my
ancestors an Acheronian himself
put a stop to this tyranny He and
others spirited the new Queen away
hiding her from the empire and all
those who would raise it again

CONAN
What care I for queens and empires

Conan turns to head back to his bed Tamara grabs him

incensed

TAMARA
Didnt you hear me This evil faces
us all All of civilization will
fall if the army of Acheron is
raised again

CONAN
I heard Only I would happily put
all of your civilization to the
torch myself

TAMARA
But -- you owe me a debt you
thankless oaf

CONAN

My only debt is to my people And
it still lies unpaid

EXT MAN OF WAR - NIGHT

A SAILOR crying grovels on his knees before Khalar and his
men

KHALAR SINGH
Which way did they sail

SAILOR
North

Khalar is surprised

KHALAR SINGH
Are you certain

SAILOR
Yes please Im telling you the
truth

Khalar nods to one of his men who slits the Sailors

Khalar turns to his FALCONER with the huge bird of prey on
his arm

KHALAR SINGH
Send word to Ukafa They come to

The Falconer nods and heads off Khalar looks to his
soldiers

KHALAR SINGH (CONTD)

EXT GALLEY - NIGHT

The ship sails like a ghost over black water the stars lit
up impossibly bright Artus finds Tamara sitting near the
bow He hands her a steaming bowl of food

ARTUS
Try not to taste it going down
would be my advice

TAMARA
Youve known Conan long

ARTUS
We sailed with him for a while I
would like to say I know the man

TAMARA
He is a riddle to me

ARTUS
Aye hes that too

TAMARA
We have the same goal Why will he
not trust me

ARTUS
Why would he Hes a stranger in
every land he trods A man with no
home no people none but the
company of ghosts And he bears the
weight of their deaths every moment
of every day

TAMARA
That is no way to live

ARTUS

He doesnt live Ive seen in him
great mirth only to watch it
smothered by greater melancholy He
owes a blood debt and he can
entertain no other joy no other
cause until it is fulfilled

TAMARA
And yet you call him friend and
risk death to help him

ARTUS
Let me tell you something of Conan
He will never lie He will never
break a trust once given And he
will never ever give up

TAMARA
Hes a stubborn ass

He is that lass He is that

INT DUNGEON - THE PIT - NIGHT

AKHUN and his Turanian slavers lead the female monks into a

large circular chamber lit by many torches Before them
lies

a PIT dark and foreboding with a bamboo grid placed atop

it

Fariq enters an AIDE holding the iron box he used earlier
Fariq has a bandage on his face where Conan struck him and
he looks even more angry and malevolent than before

FARIQ
Here we stand again Will the queen
reveal herself or must another
innocent suffer

Fariq walks past the row of women each recoiling He slaps
one Then another his rage only building

FARIQ (CONTD)
My father he tires of your
charade He grows impatient But I
have no such haste I enjoy
watching you squirm

Fariq passes Ilira slowing his pace He closes in on the
YOUNGEST FEMALE MONK a true innocent with terrified eyes

FARIQ (CONTD)
Perhaps youd like to see the end
your sisters faced back at the
monastery

Fariq slowly opens the box before her
ACHERONIAN BOX
In the darkness of the box slithers a grotesque TENTACLE
The

tentacle is severed but still alive thirsting for blood

Terrified as she is the young monk says nothing Farigq
closes the box

FARIQ (CONTD)
the

No Your fear is not enough yet
Lets try harder

Fariq nods to the slavers who unchain her from the rest

FARIQ (CONTD)
Ive read all there is to know of
mighty Acheron Why would true
Acheronians protect a traitor to
their own You once held the entire
world in your grasp now you hide
and cower like pitiful mice

He pushes the girl She falls to the grid the sound echoing
down into the pit

AN INHUMAN GROWL emits from the darkness Something comes
The girl looks below

FARIQ (CONTD)
And mice are meant to be swallowed
whole

Suddenly a MASSIVE TENTACLE ten times the size of the one
in the box comes hurtling up through the grid It grabs the
young monk its barbs ripping into her dragging her into

darkness below
Her SCREAMS echo

FARIQ (CONTD)
What was in the box could only
drink from you one at a time But
the beast of Acheron it will claim
four of you this night

FARIQ (CONTD)
Who will spare the rest and tell me
which of you is the queen

Not a single woman moves resolved Ilira catches herself
but also stays silent She looks up to see Fariq staring at
her

Her pupils widen in fear as Fariqs cold stare bores into
her

Fariq turns -- only it is another FEMALE MONK that glares at

Tamara awakens with a SCREAM her body resting against the
curved hull of the ship

Tamara looks around with a panicked look until she realizes
where she is

CONAN (0S)
I hope I awoke with less clamor

Their roles reversed now it is Tamaras turn to see Conan
sitting nearby drinking from a flask of mead

TAMARA
Youre drinking You were near

death this time yesterday

CONAN
Is there a better reason to drink

Tamara actually manages to LAUGH

TAMARA
Do you think--I could try some of
that Im curious of its taste
CONAN
Youve never tasted mead

Tamara shrugs embarrassed Conan hands her flask
a deep swallow some spilling out over her cheeks
doesnt cough and smiles brightly afterwards

TAMARA
Its good

She takes
But she

Conan reaches for the flask but Tamara ignores him taking

another swig It quickly loosens her tongue

TAMARA (CONTD)
Let me ask you something Once
youve killed Khalar and claimed
your vengeance then what You will
be free from your ghosts What of
your future Conan

CONAN
I have no future It died with my
people as I should have

TAMARA
So your life is penance For what
for living And when you too die
what do you believe happens then

Conan just shrugs taking back the mead

CONAN
Nothing

Tamara her tongue loosened by drink laughs

TAMARA
Nothing I couldnt live without
some kind of belief in the world
after this

CONAN
I believe in the cold of steel the
warmth of flesh All else is fairy

Tamara steps out onto the deck grabbing her pounding head
Her first hangover She hears a THUMPING sound followed by
ANOTHER and walks towards the side of the deck
Tamara looks overboard to the water below

TAMARAS POV

THE RIVER IS FILLED WITH BODIES Bloated they float in

red water as flies buzz around them One of them hits the
hull of the boat THUMP

Tamara blinks unsure if the vision is real -- but then
joined by other PIRATES who gape at the bodies below

Tamara turns and up ahead spies --

sails The ship gains fast

Conan exits his room sees the danger Artus appears at his
side

ARTUS
What do you think They have us
outnumbered but we might beat
their speed

CONAN
That is what they wish They drive
us to another force approaching
from the south

ARTUS
Then we fight
CONAN
No We give them what they think

The pirates leap into action tacking and turning the galley
with great speed and efficiency

Ukafa smiles his gold teeth shining The ships CAPTAIN
stands beside him

The Captain stares ahead confused

CAPTAIN
They are doing -- something

Sure enough the stern of the ship begins to part revealing

A MASSIVE CROSSBOW
Mounted with a barbed harpoon fifteen feet long

CONAN
Fire

They fire the weapon The harpoon races for the bow of the
Warship a thick rope trailing it It smashes into the wood

ripping through it like it was paper

CONAN (CONTD)
Rip her apart

The Pirates grab the heavy rope and run pulling the rope
and the harpoon back towards the Wasp

As its pulled out the barbs of the harpoon rip a wider
in the warship

gaping hole in the hull

his spearmen wait

They rush forward and grab onto the harpoon

Bring her back

Again the pirates pull the harpoon back out It falls into
the water as they pull on the rope tied to it

They do not notice Ukafa and his dozen spearmen clasping the
very same rope as its pulled toward the Galley

Artus looks at the Warship Its foundering and sinking
quickly

ARTUS (CONTD)

And then one PIRATE takes a spear through the chest All

turn to the side of the Wasp where Ukafa and his men climb
aboard

Conans eyes alight with fury

boredom

Conan motions to a pair of pirates

CONAN (CONTD)
Hide her below

BATTLE

The Spearmen rush to the attack The pirates spring to the
defense of the ship countering the Spearmen with cutlass

dagger Ukafa marshals his men as a fierce battle rages

UKAFA
Find the girl

The Spearmen quickly make their way to the interior of the
galley throwing the dead bodies of the pirates overboard

CONAN
Conan grabs the nearby jib swings over and plants both

in the face of one of the spearmen knocking him over the
side

ARTUS

The sea captain proves dangerous in his own right grabbing
the head of one of the Spearmen and violently pulling it

pirates Finally the two warriors stand only feet apart

The two warriors eye each other with satisfaction Ukafas
frightening sharpened gold teeth shine as he smiles

UKAFA (CONTD)
We are each the last of our tribe

Cimmerian Yours dies this day

Conan responds by lunging forward swinging his sword in a
broad arc Ukafa is just as quick stepping back and

his spear to block the swing

Ukafa whirls the war spear in great circles forcing Conan
parry stepping back beyond the spears reach

The two powerful warriors trade blows back and forth

able to gain the advantage

UKAFA (CONTD)
Your head will top my spear today
but know Khalars pig son will soon
share your fate

Ukafa tries to spear Conan through the chest and Conan
decides to drop his sword grabbing the spear as it passes

him

Conan then pulls on the spear throwing Ukafa off his
balance towards Conan Conan then kicks the warrior in the
chest hurtling Ukafa backwards

Now Conan turns the spear on its master Ukafa unarmed is
forced to backpedal as Conan thrusts the spear at him A

of close misses leaves Ukafa with gashes on his chest and
arm but he manages to knock the spear from Conans hands

The battle goes to hand-to-hand Its primal each of them
covered in blood Ukafa bear hugs Conan then resorts to
using his teeth to bite into Conans shoulder

back Conan falls to the stern of the ship his back against

Now finally you die

He raises up to hurl the spear through Conan only to see
Conan manning the harpoon NOW TURNED TO FACE UKAFA

The crossbow fires and the harpoon punches a massive hole
through Ukafa its momentum throwing him off the galley

the sea beyond

TAMARA

She hides inside a small compartment of the ship She hears
FOOTSTEPS walking past then returning An ARM suddenly
reaches in and grabs her

As shes pulled out Tamara SCREAMS right in Conans face
doesnt even flinch

Time to go

EXT GALLEY - NIGHT
The battle ended the pirates toss the dead Spearmen into
sea and prepare to make sail again

Meanwhile Conan lashes his sword to his back standing by
the gunwales with Tamara and Artus a SMALL DINGHY waiting

must get to the queen I would
rather you kill me here than fail
her again

Conan continues collecting infuriating Tamara

TAMARA (CONTD)
I was wrong about you You are no
fearless warrior Your heart is
closed to all but fear -- and hate

Conan draws flint starting the fire Only once his task is
complete does he answer Tamara

CONAN
We leave at dawn I will not break

But our chase points the other way

KHALAR SINGH
The chase is over They come to me
now

EXT FOREST - LATE DAY

Tamara watches Conan from a distance He silently stalks

prey
with nothing more than a knife
A BOAR
Its ears listen intently aware Suddenly it bolts
CONAN
Is just as quick racing through the forest on a
intercepting
course with the great beast He leaps over a fallen log
throwing his dagger with a sweep of his arm
The boar goes down the blade through its jugular Conan
walks up to the struggling beast showing no satisfaction as
he mercifully SNAPS its neck
INT COLOSSUS HEAD - NIGHT
The great haunches of the beast roast over the fire Conan
turns the meat
Behind him Tamara approaches She has cleaned herself up
her white robe translucent in light of the fire her wet
hair

glistening

Conan cant help but notice her supple skin her curves He
stops chewing
Tamara notices Embarrassed she turns so that he can only
see her side Conan returns to his food

TAMARA
What were the women of your tribe
like Conan

CONAN
They fought beside the men

TAMARA
So they were equals And your
mother

CONAN
She died in battle even as I was
born

TAMARA

So you never knew her It was the
same with me Ive always known
being a mother was somehow not my
fate But--

Tamara falters unsure But Conans quiet eases her

TAMARA (CONTD)
You said earlier Khor Kalba will
bring only death Were you trying
to scare me or do you really
believe our end lies there

CONAN
I dont lie

Tamara nods having heard as much about Conan She turns
back
to face him no longer hiding her body

TAMARA
Then we dont have much time Your
mother perished too young but at
least she died having known the
touch of one who cared

Tamara steps closer to Conan

TAMARA (CONTD)
So -- do you care Conan

Conan rises to her his broad form looming over her slight
as

Conans

build

But Conan shows surprising gentleness as he removes her robe
and pulls her naked body into his their mouths meeting in a
desperate kiss

LOVE SCENE

Conan lies atop Tamara by the fire their sinewy limbs
intertwined fingers locked together He thrusts into her
causing her face to contort in pleasure and pain

The fire grows brighter as Tamara rolls on top undulating

their pace quickens Tamara CRIES OUT in ecstasy
AFTERMATH

Tamara stares into the fire her body wrapped around

She gently caresses the notched scars cut into his arm

TAMARA (CONTD)
Ive only ever heard you speak of
what youd die for Conan What
would you live for

Conan his eyes closed keeps them shut

CONAN
Do you ever tire of talking Let me
rest woman

Tamara reaches down between Conans legs His eyes open

TAMARA
I thought that may work

Conan growls and pulls himself atop Tamara Looking down at
her face her hair loose and wild shes beautiful in the
soft glow of the firelight

TAMARA (CONTD)
I see you clearly now finally
after all this time
(she kisses him deeply)
I would be that which you live for
Conan if you would have me You
may have faith in nothing Conan --
but I have faith in you
Conan lowers himself back down upon her

DISSOLVE TO

EXT MOUNTAIN RIDGE - DAY

Conan powers his way to the top of a high ridge spotting
down in the vista below

KHOR KALBA

Surrounded on three sides by the coastline the stone
fortress of Khalar Singh rests on a plateau overlooking a
bustling tented city below

Conan spots a long CARAVAN of packed camels working their
way
towards town driven by DESERT TRADERS from Shem

CONAN
Well slip in along with those
traders But youll need a change
of clothes those monks robes will
draw attention

Tamara looks down at her loose-fitting robes

TAMARA
What will I wear

EXT KHOR KHALBA - ENTRANCE - DAY

The caravan rides up to the walled entrance to the city
guarded by Khalars troops Blended in amongst the others
Conan now wears the elaborate head scarf and clothes of
Shemish traders obscuring all but his eyes

TAMARA

Tamara is dressed like a Shemish serving girl her taut body
barely covered by silken drapings She glares at Conan
miserable

TAMARA
I dont understand why I couldnt
be dressed as you are I look like
a whore
CONAN
And what better disguise for a
monk

Conan tugs on the rope for the camel to move faster The

Camel BRAYS and rears Conan yanks harder and the camel
flies

forward its eyes wide

Conan meets its eye

CONAN (CONTD)
Do not test me beast

TAMARA
Is there not a living thing you can
be at peace with

They ride into the city past the troops

EXT KHOR KHALBA CITY - ENTRANCE - DAY

Conan and Tamara walk through the towns teeming market a
otherworldly bazaar replete with animal sacrifices veiled
faces and not a hint of morality

STRANGER

A FIGURE his form hidden beneath a cloak spots Conan and
Tamara as they enter and begins to follow them

WOODEN PLATFORM

The city ends at the sheer cliff wall at the bottom of the
plateau There stands a WOODEN PLATFORM that is lowered by a
massive winch unloading a cavalry regiment and then raising
back up to the fortress above

CONAN
Its probably only way into
Khalars fortress Im sure it is
heavily guarded at all times day
and night

TAMARA
So we must try to scale the cliff

CONAN
And dodge arrows as we do so
Conan motions up to the winch Standing beside it are a half
dozen of the four-armed ARCHERS

CONAN (CONTD)
During the day wed easily be
spotted on the climb And it would
be useless to even attempt at
night No we must find another
way

STRANGERS POV

As Conan continues around the base of the mesa the Figure
following Conan is joined by TWO OTHERS

ALLEYWAY

Conan and Tamara reach a less crowded area of the village
when a VOICE rings out behind them

VOICE (0S)
Halt

Conan spins sword at the ready From out of the shadows
comes a pair of MEN their beady eyes fixed on Tamara

CONAN
Thieves Youll regret finding me

VOICE (0S)
I think not

From out of the shadows steps the ONE-EYED THIEF the same
one who Conan saved from Lucius beatings He smiles at
Conan lifting a KEY from a rope around his neck

ONE EYED THIEF

It took longer than you think to
cut this out of Lucius stomach
After all that work I figured Id
keep it -- for old times sake

INT THIEVES TAVERN - AFTERNOON

A rundown hall built beneath the city Wooden supports hold
up the buildings of the entire city block overhead

And within the hall a gathering of THIEVES and ROGUES
nubile

fq

Theyre a flinty collection many of them missing fingers or
even hands evidence of Khalars cruel justice

They eat and drink sharing tales and tips WENCHES and
SERVING WOMEN their cautious eyes following the Cimmerian
outsider

The One Eyed Thief takes them to an open table and
immediately three of the serving women descend upon Conan
caressing him

fq

Tamara watches this jaw dropped and manages a COUGH even
as a SERVING GIRL delivers mead to the table

Conan just smiles as he enjoys the silky bodies of the

women their breasts practically framing his face

CONAN
What Do you wish to join in

cut To

Conan cleans mead from his face scowling at Tamara as the
One-Eyed Thief uses the tabletop to explain the fortress

ONE EYED THIEF

--so you were right about the
platform Youll be long dead
before you make it top Same with
scaling the cliff Theres no known
way to break into the fortress

CONAN
So thats it

ONE EYED THIEF
I didnt say that I just said

theres no known way in -- because
no one has ever tried to But
breaking out -- thats another

story Its not much easier but
its possible

The One Eyed Thief offers the same gap-toothed grin
ONE EYED THIEF (CONTD)

You just need to find someone crazy
enough to show you the way
INT SEWERS - NIGHT

Tamara is the last to follow Conan the One Eyed Thief and

the three THIEVES from before down a short ladder Below
lies

a darkened catacomb lit only by their torches

ONE EYED THIEF

These catacombs run underneath the
entire city even to the cistern
that drains out from the fortress
dungeon

Tamaras foot drops into knee high water She immediately
grabs her nose

TAMARA
Catacombs You mean sewers

ONE EYED THIEF
Piss and shit are the last things

you need to worry about down here

Tamara eyes the muddy water nothing visible beneath its
murky surface

INT OTHER SEWERS - NIGHT

The group wades through the water single file Conan
notices

HIEROGLYPHICS and carvings on the wall of the catacomb

Massive creatures of the sea dark sorcery ritual
sacrifice

CONAN
What is it

TAMARA
A warning These catacombs are
connected to the sea It says that
the beasts of Acheron protect its
secrets

CONAN
Not from me

Conan presses on into the darkness
the

She

INT CISTERN - NIGHT

The catacomb widens out to a giant circular cistern its
walls rising up high into the darkness As the torches bring
light to the space we see HUNDREDS OF DEAD ROTTING BODIES

As Conan and Tamara walk forward the One Eyed Thief and the
other stop at the entrance

ONE EYED THIEF

Sorry friend We stop here Weve
heard too much about what lies
within to go any further

Conan simply nods and the thieves depart Conan raises his
torch illuminating the near wall

TAMARA
Where now

CONAN
Around Up

Conan heads off one direction leaving Tamara to navigate
other half Her torch illuminates the grizzly path ahead
inhales deeply and takes her first step

CONAN

Following the slick wall he passes many DEAD BODIES but
only one catches his eye He stops before it

DEAD WARRIOR
Nothing more than a skeleton picked clean by the rats But
he still bears his leather armor and a horned helmet that

resembles his fathers own

Conan takes the helmet and places it on his head It fits
perfectly

TAMARA

Tamara is gingerly making her way through the knee high
sewage water and the dead bodies submerged within

TAMARA
right

Oh

Tamara leaps up swinging the torch down towards the water
Conan nearby unsheathes his sword

CONAN
What

TAMARA
Something touched me Something
slimy

Conan walks over the torchlight revealing something on
Tamaras leg Its a SLUG which he flicks off

CONAN
Crom Stop wasting time

But when Conan steps forward something ROILS THE WATER

before him He spots a HUGE TENTACLE just before its
submerges back into the water

CONAN (CONTD)
Crom indeed

Then Tamara SCREAMS as another tentacle rises up from the
water wrapping around her waist Tamara grabs hold of the
wall as the tentacle tries to pull her underwater

Conan immediately SLASHES the tentacle pulling Tamara away
The squirming decapitated tentacle squirts black blood
everywhere the knee high water seems to come alive with
roiling intensity

Conan spins finding a circular stone staircase tiled into
the far cistern wall

CONAN (CONTD)
Lets go

EXT CIRCULAR STAIRWAY - CISTERN
As they work their way up the circular stairwell towards a

thin shaft of firelight up ahead

INT DUNGEON - NIGHT
way

on

hear

Carved out of solid black rock both sides of the broad
corridor are occasionally punctuated by thick steel doors
leading to prison cells

Conan and Tamara emerge from a sewer drain pushing their
to the floor of the hallway The heavy darkness presses in
Conans torch like a sentient animate thing

The floor of the corridor is lined with DEAD BODIES in
varying states of decay There are buckets filled with
entrails and feces upended Tamara put her hand over her
mouth

Conan continues down the hallway He and Tamara begin to
the sound of EERIE CHANTING

TAMARA
What is that

Up ahead the torch-lined dungeon plunges into darkness as
the torches end Conan holds up his own torch struggling to
peer into the black void

CONAN
Nothing good

Conan takes a step forward when suddenly a POWERFUL WIND
blows out his torch A moment later theres the sound of A
GATE WHISTLING DOWN AND CRASHING INTO THE GROUND

In the darkness comes a DEEP EARTHY CHUCKLE

VOICE (0S)
Welcome

A HOST OF OIL LIGHTS SUDDENLY COME UP revealing that the
gate that closed behind them was actually just a door to a
vast CAGE built around a massive PIT

INT THE PIT - NIGHT
The same pit where Fariq sacrificed the female monk only
now a half dozen COMBATANTS stand on the grid above the

void

Hanging high above the pit in baskets lie other PRISONERS
including Tamaras fellow female monks Several of them YELL
cage

have

out Tamaras name as they see her
And watching everything from an amphitheater above the
is the massive Akhun and several of his slavers

AKHUN
Which ever one of you slaves gets
me the girl lives

The Combatants all close in on Conan and Tamara each taking
a different plank way to get to them

CONAN
(TO TAMARA)
Stay behind me

Tamara steps behind Conan who blocks the others path to
her

CONAN (CONTD)
Who dies first

The first two COMBATANTS attack as one the first wielding a
short sword the other a pike The pikeman thrusts first
Conan deftly stepping aside then pulling the pike sending
the wielder off balance and into the abyss

The prisoner with the short sword doesnt fare much better
as Conan evades his swipe and decapitates him with a single
blow

TAMARA

Tamara sees that the prisoner baskets are suspended by the
top half of the metallic cage She begins scaling the cage
her eyes set upon the imprisoned monks

CONAN

Three more COMBATANTS step in to replace the fallen duo
Conan readies himself as the first one steps up only to

the combatant suddenly grabbed by a ENORMOUS TENTACLE much
like the one Conan cut through earlier

TENTACLED MONSTER

Up from the darkness of the pit comes a gargantuan monster
rickety

first

to

gigantic octopus-like behemoth with multiple tentacles that
feed a pulsing black orifice lined with razor sharp teeth

The creature reaches out and grabs another SCREAMING
combatants lowering him to its mouth and devouring him in
its gnashing maw

The creature reaches for Conan who ducks underneath the
tentacle the slices it off He immediately turns back to

check on Tamara -- and he discovers shes not there

He looks up to see Tamara scaling the cage now nearly fifty
feet directly above him

CONAN (CONTD)
Crom

AKHUN

The massive warrior spots Tamara getting close to the
prisoner baskets and motions to his two Jailers

AKHUN
Get her

TAMARA
Shes reached the base of the chain supporting one of the
baskets when she spots the two Jailers closing in climbing
towards her from either side

CONAN

Spotting Tamara overhead Conan tries to keep beneath her
evading the swarming tentacles while balancing on the

planks

TAMARA
Shes scaling down the basket supporting chain when the
Jailer reaches out to grab her She reacts by GASHING his
eyes and as he instinctively grabs them he FALLS TOWARDS
THE PIT

CONAN

Conan barely dives out of the way as the fallen Jailer
SMASHES through the plank he was on forcing Conan to jump

another
Cimmerian

monster

Conan

Just then another COMBATANT comes swinging for the
forcing him to defend while still not balanced

TAMARA
The next Jailer grabs her pulling her off the cage He
struggles to pull towards a nearby exit hatch when she BITES
HIS EAR OFF
The Jailer drops Tamara who SCREAMS as she falls

CONAN
Conan spots Tamara plunging towards him In one swift move
he SLASHES his opponent ducks underneath a writhing
tentacle and reaches out to GRAB TAMARA BY THE ARM AS SHE
FALLS His shoulder nearly pops out but he manages to hold
onto Tamara

TAMARA

She swings above the chasm the gnashing teeth of the

below her Only a single splintering plank holds her and
Conan aloft

CONAN

With a grunt he swings Tamara and throws her to safety at
the edge of the pit

But as he gets to his feet he spots the massive Akhun
entering the arena

AKHUN
The giant warrior grins as he boards the same plank as

He thrusts his thunderous legs down causing the plank to
bend and warp

Conan struggle to balance on the undulating plank but his
training in Cimmeria serves him well

Akhun smiles and step closer again thrusting down with his
legs Conans balance is thrown but theres no other plank
close enough for him to jump to
sword

AKHUN (CONTD)
Youll make a nice meal

Akhun steps down on the plank one last time but this time
Conan uses the momentum to SPRINGBOARD UP INTO AIR

Conan soars into the air his cat-like reflexes keeping him
focused as he lands right before the stunned Akhun With one

great slash of his blade Conan eviscerates Akhun

Akhuns innards drop out of his belly as he falls into the
abyss only to be snapped up by the massive beast

cut To

INT ARENA OF THE PIT - LATER
Conan lowers down the last of the baskets Tamara use a
to smash open the lock freeing the prisoners inside

Tamara shares hugs of joy with the other monks of her flock
The women look worn but unbroken

TAMARA
Where is Ilira

FEMALE MONK
She was taken away by Fariq

TAMARA
Then Im too late

One of the stronger looking women an ELDER MONK steps
forward

ELDER MONK
No She was just taken this
morning Its not yet midnight
and Khalar still must bring her to
the cave of Acheron

Tamara nods and the women begin to ARM THEMSELVES Conan
shakes his head at the rag-tag group

CONAN
Youre going to fight Khalars
troops Just you
The Elder Monk grabs and nearby pike and twirls it expertly
about her body clearly well versed in it use

TAMARA
Cimmerians arent the only women
who know how to fight And to kill

Tamara looks at the other monks

TAMARA (CONTD)
Our duty was to keep the queen
safe We failed But if Khalar
brings her to Acheron it will rise

again -- and all our peoples

sacrifice is for nothing
(MORE)

TAMARA (CONTD)
So if the queen is not free by the
stroke of midnight -- she must be
already dead

The other monks nod and they start to head off Tamara is
the

last to head off her eyes burning into Conans

CONAN
You want my help again

TAMARA
No You kept your word Ill keep
mine I pray you fulfill your debt

Tamara kisses Conans cheek one last time and heads off

INT CATACOMBS - NIGHT

The monk travel in single file the Elder Monk leading the
way Suddenly she stops motioning to an entranceway ahead

ELDER MONK
(WHISPERING)
Guard

TAMARA

(WHISPERING)
Dont kill him We need to find out
which way Ilira was taken

The Elder Monk nods and slips up ahead We hear a SMASH
INT CATACOMB ENTRANCEWAY - NIGHT

The stunned GUARD lies before the assembled monks Tamara
glares down at him

TAMARA
Tell us where the last girl was
taken

The Guard just LAUGHS at them through bloody teeth

CONAN (0S)
Let me ask

The Guards face drops as Conan steps out from the darkness

TAMARA
Your debt --

CONAN
Will be where your queen is

Tamara smiles She knows it is a half truth

INT FORTRESS - THRONE ROOM - NIGHT

As Conan and the monks enter the throne room is empty
scattered light barely illuminating the expansive chamber

Ilira sits on the throne crown on her slumped head Tamara
runs over to her

TAMARA
Tlira

She raises Iliras head only to discover lifeless eyes
Tamara cradles her best friends face

TAMARA (CONTD)
Shes dead Its over

VOICE (0S)
Not yet

Before the monks can react ARROWS STREAK OUT FROM THE
DARKNESS killing them all Only Conan is quick enough to
dodge his arrow by diving aside
When he comes up Khalar has Tamara his sword at her neck
Several ARCHERS stand behind him at the ready

KHALAR SINGH
Its only begun Because that one
was not the heir to Acheron

Khalar smiles down at Tamara

KHALAR SINGH (CONTD)
She is

Slowly what hes saying dawns on her

TAMARA
No It cant be --

KHALAR SINGH
Secretive the traitors of Acheron
It wasnt easy but Fariq finally
wrung honesty from the girl That
poor innocent was forced to live a
lie even as the truth was kept
from the queen herself

(MORE)

KHALAR SINGH (CONTD)

(TO CONAN)
And you did the rest barbarian My
thanks for delivering the Queen to
me

TAMARA
No

Suddenly a trap door opens beneath Conan and drops down in
the darkness landing with a heavy THUD

INT FORGE - NIGHT

Conan awakens to the familiar sound of a hot blade SIZZLING
as it hits the cooling vat

But this is no dream of his fathers forge -- as he looks up
to see Fariq holding a sword its tip still red hot the
flames of the fortresss forge behind him

Conans thrusts forward only to find his armed chained
around a heavy mortar and stone pillar
Fariq strokes his newly acquired scar

FARIQ
At last you awaken Cimmerian Its
been hours youve made me wait for
my fun

Conan says nothing but his eyes scan the room taking in
everything

FARIQ (CONTD)
You made me lose face in front of
my father That wasnt wise But
what should I expect from a
Cimmerian

CONAN
A swift end

Conan strains at the chain ripping the skin beneath his
shackles -- but a thin wisp of mortar comes loose from the
pillar

FARIQ
Hardly But that is a difference
between you and me A swift end
would be a mercy I do not intend to
grant No you must suffer for your
transgressions

(MORE)

FARIQ (CONTD)
You must beg for your suffering to
end Just as your people did

He waves the glowing sword tip in front of Conans face

CONAN
You lie I was there My father
never uttered a sound

Fariq LAUGHS amused

FARIQ
You were there What were you
doing warrior Watching your
father die without saying a sound
Taking your eyes will be justice
indeed coward
Fariq pushes the hot tip of the sword against Conans skin
Conans face reddens with pain but he doesnt utter a

sound
But as Conan pulls on his chains -- more mortar falls As
Fariq turns back to place the sword in the forge Conan
notices one of the bricks the chains are fastened to is
LOOSE
CONAN
I saw my father die Slain by one
who can only kill men already on
their knees
Fariq turns his eyes blazing He glances over at the two
GUARDS by the door who try not to listen
FARIQ
Ive killed many in battle cur
CONAN
Really Then why did your father
not let you face me before when I
had sword in hand He thought you
unequal to the task
Fariq responds by pushing the red hot blade against Conans
chest Conan just YELLS back at him
CONAN (CONTD)
Coward Prove your strength
Again Fariq pushes the hot blade against Conans skin
CONAN (CONTD)
Take my eyes coward -- if you can

Fariq yells and thrust the tip of the sword at Conans head
Conan lifts his manacles forcing the blade up into the
brick
holding his chain
Then Conan pulls on the chains with all his might loosening
the heavy brick which falls to the ground
In one powerful movement Conan begins SWINGING the chain
with the mortar block on the end a homemade ball and chain
The two Guards come forward sword drawn only to meet with
a

CRUNCHING blow by Conans weapon Both their heads get caved

Fariq rushes Conan getting in too close for Conans wide
swings Conan simply meets Fariqs sword with the heavy

chains then encircles Fariqs neck with the steel bonds

Fariq CHOKES falling to the ground gasping for air But
Conan doesnt kill him -- yet

THE FORGE
A vat of molten steel bubbles in a cauldron within the
Conan uses tongs to lift the cauldron out

FARIQ
Conan kicks him onto his back Fariqs last vision is that

Conan tipping the cauldron the hot iron descending toward
his eyes Fariq SCREAMS

Conan reaches down and picks up Fariqs sword THE SWORD
CONANS FATHER MADE FOR HIM

EXT SEA PENINSULA - NIGHT

By torchlight Khalar Singh leads his black-armored PERSONAL
GUARD two dozen men strong across a rocky peninsula
jutting out into the sea On the back of Khalars horse
bound rides the helpless Tamara

As they round a large rock spire they spy a fearsome and awe
inspiring sight A massive SKULL seemingly a natural rock
formation rises over the peninsula

As they ride closer we can make out one more detail -- the
mouth of the skull is actually a massive door at least

feet high and seemingly made up of jagged bone It has the
appearance of teeth completing the skull illusion

INT ACHERON CAVE - NIGHT
It takes the full complement of soldiers to open the

doors Khalar Singh rides in Moonlight from the huge eyes

the skull illuminate terrifying faces in the darkness Faces
shackles

of demonic warrior statues

At their feet lie the decaying bones of human skeletons too
numerous to count

TAMARA
This is no empire only a
graveyard

KHALAR SINGH
You see only with your eyes

Khalar nods to his men Two Guardsmen take their torches and
light other torches set in the walls It sets off a chain
reaction As far as the eye can see torches ignite revealing
the true scope of this place

An enormous cave the walls lined with monumental columns
that frame countless bas relief carvings of demonic origin

And at the far of the cave an ALTAR sits beneath a raised
THRONE surrounded by a SACRIFICIAL POOL The pool is empty

Khalar turns to his guards

KHALAR SINGH (CONTD)

Close the gates and stay here Send
my son to me when he arrives
(motioning to two of them)

You two come with me

THE ALTAR

Khalar dismounts at the sacrificial altar carved of out of
purple-shaded rock Around its edges are deep channels for
the blood of its victims And on its four corners --

of bone

KHALAR SINGH
The Acheronians had a wonderful
sense of balance dont you think
For one to ascend to royalty
another must fall

With the flick of a wrist Khalar cuts Tamaras bonds

Tamara head butts him struggling to escape but Khalar
absorbs the blow effortlessly He throws Tamara upon the
extend

BURLAP

climbs

altar his two guards shackling her in place

KHALAR SINGH (CONTD)

For a hundred generations the kings
of Acheron were crowned and the
queens were sacrificed

Khalar snaps his fingers and two guardsmen bring an ornately
carved BOX MADE OF BONE laying it before the altar Like a
Chinese puzzle box Khalar manipulates the carvings of
skulls sacrifices and creatures until the box UNLATCHES

And from the box he lifts two items A CROWN OF GOLD and A
CROWN OF IRON The crown of gold is magnificent ornately
detailed gold that glows in the firelight

But the crown of iron is terrifying Huge rough spikes

from it in every direction It looks more like a weapon than
a crown

KHALAR SINGH (CONTD)

What a day for you This morning
you were a handmaiden Tonight you
are a queen giving birth to an

empire

cut To

EXT CAVE ENTRANCE - NIGHT

Bloodied and weary Conan approaches the Skull Rock He has
nothing more than his sword his loincloth and a small

SACK tied to his hip

He stumbles falling to his knees His wounds have taken a
grave toll Still he stands and presses on

He pushes on the doors They do not budge in the least He
puts his shoulder to the doors -- his every muscle straining
to their utmost Again -- no movement

Conan backs away taking stock of the surroundings He

up the side of the rock

INT ACHERON CAVE - NIGHT

Khalar Singh CHANTS in Acheronian Ancient harsh words as
he lifts the two crowns overhead offering them to the
statues of dark gods all around

T

TAMARA
Stop You dont know what you are
about to do

KHALAR SINGH
But I do For thirty years I have
dreamed of this day The day our
people rise from the ashes

halar Singh continues his chant and places the gold crown

eflects off the crown bathing the sacrificial pool in an
nnatural glow

K
upon his head As he does so the light from the moon
r
u

THUMP-THUMP A deep and foreboding sound echoes throughout
the cave shaking everything like an earthquake It sounds
like the heartbeat of a giant

Khalar next places the iron crown around Tamaras head She
thrashes and struggles but to no avail

Once the crown is around her head -- THUMP-THUMP The spikes
around the iron crown grow shorter AS THE SPIKES DRIVE

HEMSELVES INTO HER HEAD She SCREAMS in agony

Blood drips from beneath the crown flowing into channels
around the edges of the altar

KHALAR SINGH (CONTD)
It begins You give birth to an

empire
EXT THE SIDE OF THE SKULL - NIGHT

Conan climbs -- muscles straining -- slipping -- hanging on
by one hand -- and climbing again

T

HUMP-THUMP The statuary shakes indeed the whole earth

does Conan nearly slips but keeps his grip

Hi

CONAN
Crom

e reaches the eye of the skull

REVERSE ANGLE
With the moon over his shoulder Conan stares down at the
unholy sight before him We pull back revealing Tamara her
blood draining from her body

INT ACHERON CAVE - CONTINUOUS

Tamara her face pale from blood loss begins to pray in
pained whispers

KHALAR SINGH
Its good that you pray Gods will
be here soon

Tamara struggles to speak her body wracked with pain

TAMARA
He1l1l--be---here--sooner

KHALAR SINGH
Who

CONAN (0S)
Me

Khalar turns to see the outline of Conan framed by the
moonlight looking down at Khalar from atop of one the
warrior statues A thick vine dangles nearby Conans route
down from the cave roof above

Conan then leaps down to the skeleton covered floor before
the altar It is a killing floor

The two Guardsmen leap for him but Conan dispatches them
with a pair of strikes Both fall down dead

Conan meets Tamaras eyes a look of determination
assurance He starts toward the altar

KHALAR SINGH
I will say this for you barbarian
You are hard to kill

CONAN
Let her go

KHALAR SINGH
Youve faced me before and lost
What do you think has changed now
of

beloved

trembles

CONAN
My purpose

Conan lunges for Khalar their swords meeting with a flash

sparks They fight to a brief standstill when ---THUMP
THUMP

THE ALTAR

Tamara writhes in pain as the spikes drive deeper into her
head More blood pours forth The blood in the channels
speeds up and finds the channel leading down to the
sacrificial pool

Conan makes another movement toward the altar but Khalar
nimbly blocks his path

KHALAR SINGH
You are strong Cimmerian but we
both know you are not my equal

Conan takes the burlap sack wrapped at his hip pulls it off

CONAN
Once you used my father to teach
your son a lesson about strength
Now let me teach you

Conan tosses out what is inside It falls to the ground
rolling to Khalar Singhs feet

FARIQS HEAD
Khalar looks down at the ground -- at the head of his
son his eyes gone replaced by molten metal Khalar
in shock and rage

KHALAR SINGH
No

Khalar reaches for the severed head giving Conan a brief
window to rush to Tamaras side Conan tries to lift her off
the altar but the bone shackles still pin her down

KHALAR SINGH (CONTD)
Cimmerian
then

more

Enraged Khalar CHARGES Conan throwing all his skill and
force into an all-out attack Conan simply sidesteps it

shatters the bone shackle holding one of Tamaras wrists
Before he can shatter the other Khalar charges again

Khalar swings Conan spins his blade catching Khalars just
inches from his face Conan throws Khalar off him knocking
the warlord back ten feet Khalars attack is feral
uncontrolled Hes lost his balance

Spinning and striking blindly Conan smashes the second
shackle on her wrist He continues his motion bringing his
sword around to meet Khalars next strike

Now Khalar looks like the enraged amateur and Conan the

polished warrior Their battle takes them away from the
altar

With her hands free Tamara struggles to pull the spikes out
and remove the crown

THE KILLING FLOOR

Conan repels another Khalar attack this time striking
Khalars chest and drawing blood The Guardsmen arrive from
the other side of the cave drawing their swords

Khalar waves them off his fury aimed at the Cimmerian

KHALAR SINGH (CONTD)
The Queen Shackle her

THE ALTAR

In agony Tamara pulls one of the spikes out then another
She pushes with all her might lifting the crown of iron off
her bloodied head --

When the Guardsmen charge her pin her down and force the
crown back on

THUMP THUMP The crown spikes imbed themselves even deeper
as Tamara SCREAMS The blood now fills the channels of the
altar

WE FOLLOW the trail of blood down the side of the altar in
a spiral channel around the leg and in a wide circle around
the altar until reaching the channels end --
slightest

spires

Khalar

THE FIRST DROP OF TAMARAS BLOOD TOUCHES THE SACRIFICIAL
POOL It BOILS instantly multiplying itself exponentially
bubbling forth and filling the entire pool

AND ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE A massive earthquake jolts the
entire cave

THE KILLING FLOOR

As Khalar Singh and Conan battle the ground beneath them on
the wide cave floor CRACKS and SPLINTERS

THUMP-THUMP The earthquake intensifies and the entire floor
of the cave GIVES WAY tumbling into an incredible abyss
Conan and Khalar alike grab onto the only rocks they can
reach to prevent them from falling further

Conan ends up against one of the walls on the side of the
cave Khalar clings to the rocks on the edge of the sacred
pool

Their bodies are illuminated by a fiery glow They look
below searching for the source of the glow

ACHERON

Another two hundred feet deep lies the golden spired city of
ancient Acheron The cave is but a forechamber the

taste of the true glory and horror of Acheron

And as they stare down into the ancient city the shadows
there MOVE

Is it a trick of the light No Whatever the dark forms are
they are coming this way climbing the tallest demonic

and leaping impossibly far to climb up after Conan and
Singh
Khalar gazes down at the city with wide eyes

KHALAR SINGH (CONTD)
Beyond my dreams --

THE ALTAR
to

Tamara her bodys blood nearly drained is still shackled

the altar which now teeters over the edge of chasm poised
to fall into the fiery depths

TAMARA
Conan

CONAN

On the other side of the abyss Conan spots her and scales
the cave wall up to a tiered plateau He moves quickly
trying to get to Tamara

KHALAR SINGH

Khalar watches entranced as the first of the creatures
rises out of the pit They climb the walls like insects
clinging to the walls their heads swiveling like a praying
mantis

ACHERONIAN WARRIORS

The look like the statues above -- a hybrid -- part human
part demon Their skin is a perfect black armor carved of
black bone faces once human but now demonic with blood red
eyes and gnashing teeth

They advance on Khalar Singh who is furthest down now that
Conan climbs upward towards Tamara

KHALAR SINGH

(IN ACHERONIAN)
I am Khalar Singh King of Acheron
I command you to kneel

And this demonic horde advances right for him their razor
sharp teeth bared Unsure Khalar grips his tulwars tight
The demonic creatures draw close and they -- kneel They
climb out of the abyss and immediately lower their heads
before Khalar Singh

Out of the corner of his eye Khalar spots Conan drawing
near

KHALAR SINGH (CONTD)

(IN ACHERONIAN)
Show him the might of the army of
Acheron
ensues

But they do not rush to follow the order They stir One of
them with more ornate bone armor than the rest looks over at
Khalars Guardsmen

ACHERONIAN COMMANDER
(IN ACHERONIAN)
First we feed

Its voice is somewhere between a whisper and a hiss

KHALAR SINGH
Fine Take your fill I will kill
him myself

CONAN

Conan is on an intercept course with Tamara leaping across
chasms from statue to statue Just below him the first wave
of Acheronian Warriors reach the Khalars remaining
Guardsmen

KHALARS GUARDSMEN

Khalars Guardsmen who have been watching the events with
mouths agape realize the danger too late The horde of
Acheronian Warriors leaps on them and a massive battle

between the demonic warriors and the soldiers
CONAN

His climbing is dizzying reminiscent of his youth scaling
the cliffs of Cimmeria

KHALAR

Intercepts Conan just below the altar his tulwars at the
ready

CONAN
Your story ends here

The two warriors square off fighting even as they cling to
the statues

ACHERONIAN WARRIORS
The demon warriors not only slay Khalars Guardsmen but rip

their still living bodies apart dousing themselves in the
blood of their victims It is a violent ritual both
stone

Tamaras

Tamara

Bacchantic and gruesome
KHALAR
Launches himself at Conan his tulwars sparking off the

statuary Conan leaps to another statue parrying the blows
Khalar overextends himself and Conans sword just barely
misses his throat

Khalar pulls back tries to settle himself Conans eyes
narrow he knows what Khalar is doing

CONAN (CONTD)
Like a woman Fariq cried and
begged me to spare him

Khalar ROARS in rage launching an all-out offensive Conan
backs up slowly waiting for his moment

And it comes quickly Conan ducks below the tulwars and CUTS
Khalar across the stomach Khalar loses his balance and
falls one hand grabbing a protruding statue arm dangling
over the abyss

Conan raises his sword to finish the job

TAMARA (0S)
Conan

Conan glances down The Acheronian Commander drank his fill
and now moves to the altar itself his claw stroking

body With one touch the shackles open He and the
Acheronian Warriors drag her pale body toward the abyss

Khalar grins up at him through bloody teeth

KHALAR SINGH
They take her to a place you can
never follow Who will you fail
Cimmerian Your father or your
woman

Conan leaps down to the altar The Acheronian Warriors

attack Standing atop the altar Conan cuts down all comers
cutting his way through the enemy working his way to

CONAN
Tamara

They leap on Conan impossibly fast They stab him They cut
him But he does not stop Even wounded he throws them into
the abyss

And he reaches Tamara just before the Commander drags her
below He grabs her arm The Commander grabs her other arm
baring his shark-like teeth

BLAM Conan punches him in the mouth with his free hand and
the Commander falls into the abyss

The bloody Conan pulls Tamara up into his arms Only for
Tamara to scream

TAMARA
Conan

Conan spins just in time as Khalar strikes Khalars tulwar
narrowly misses and Conan counters His fathers sword runs
Khalar Singh through

Khalars body falls into the abyss

But the Acheronian Warriors surround them Thousands climb
out of the abyss teeth bared closing in on the wounded
Conan Tamara badly weakened herself grabs Conan

TAMARA (CONTD)
Conan you know what you must do
Kill me

CONAN
No

TAMARA
It is the only way to end this My
death gives others life

CONAN
I cannot

TAMARA
You must Your parents both
understood that purpose Now it is
yours Live Conan

A tear falls from Tamaras face The demonic warriors
prepare
to strike

Conan drives his sword into Tamaras heart The crown spikes
retract and it falls from her head tumbling into the abyss

BOOM A seismic explosion shakes everything an unearthly
GUST OF WIND pulling the Acheronian Warriors back down into
the abyss

ACHERONIAN CAVE

The cave begins to fall massive sections of the roof
dropping in to decimate the pyramid and the city below

ALTAR

Conan pulls Tamaras body away even as the world descends
into dust and debris

EXT CAVE ENTRANCE - NIGHT
Khalars HORSE stands near the entrance Conan puts Tamaras
body carefully atop the horse then mounts it himself He

positions her in front of him his arms encircling her

Conan gives her lifeless body one last kiss her blood
staining his lips red as his mothers did as a child

EXT HIGH PLATEAU - DAWN

A blazing sun threatens to explode over the nearby

mountains
Conan holds a single torch in his hand His look is hard
Grim
We pull back to reveal a funeral pyre Tamaras body atop
it

Conan places the torch to the pyre It quickly spreads

We move in closer and closer upon Conans ice blue eyes a
blazing fire erupting in them A fire that will never be
extinguished

TAMARA (0S)
Live Conan Live

FADE TO BLACK
