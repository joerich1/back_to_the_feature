PIERRE exhales sighs and picks up a book from an ‘adjacent
night-stand The book is Celine’s Journey To The End Of The

Night

PIERRE

(reading from book)
‘“Brutes to the right of us brutes
to the left of us they were all

really mattered was an enormous
longing for sleep all the rest was

brook a familiar-looking wall

(turns page continues

reading)
“But mostly it was the smells

I saw this little boy yesterday
Pierre He was playing with some

‘other children He was small with -

dark eyes and hair and the face of
a forlorn cherub as painted by
Raphael They were playing some
game and the little boy was
reluctant at first He had been
playing with some dead flowers
before the others asked if hed
like to join them

(MORE)
SCUMBAG (contd)

The boy finally agreed and joined
the circle where the children were
playing marbles or some other game
children play But the boy was not
used to playing with others I
could tell by the way his eyes
nervously darted over the other
children as if seeking out some
ulterior motive or wicked
mischief He wasnt used to playing
with others and so when one of the
children laughed at a mistake the
little boy had made during the
game he stood up and called them
all dirty names He then walked
slowly away A while later as I
was picking up my birth control
pills I saw the same little boy
behind the pharmacy He was
fondling his dead flowers and he
was crying

(beat)
I was reminded of you Pierre I
think that little boy is very much
‘like you I only wish you would
show him to me

SCUMBAG turns to PIERRE with soft wet affection in her eyes
PIERRE looks deep into those eyes and for a moment it seems
as if hes about to dissolve into warmth and affection
himself PIERRE takes a drag of his cigarette then flicks
some ashes onto SCUMBAG

INT POLICE HEADQUARTERS CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

A bunch of FRENCH POLICE sitting around a conference room
Standing in front of a desk is the CHIEF INSPECTOR He has a

moustache

slicked-back hair ‘sunglasses and

a permanent

scowl With a pointer in hand ‘he struts before his men in
the middle of a speech

CHIEF INSPECTOR
As many of you know our government
has given asylum to the American
fugitive Holden Braddock
il

CHIEF INSPECTOR walks over to a nearby bulletin-board which

has a blown-up photo of PIGEONSHIT and thrusts his pointer
at the photo

CHIEF INSPECTOR
(continuing)
0or “Canyon Mack” as his many
victims knew him

He taps on the photo three times then strolls away from the
bulletin-board

CHIEF INSPECTOR
(continuing)

Why did our government grant asylum
to a serial rapist and murderer
I’‘1l tell you why Because that is
the nature of France Rebellion
godlessness and nihilism B
perpetual “fuck you we don’t give
a shit” to the world

His men all nod and mummer in casual agreement ’ CHIEF
INSPECTOR strolls back to the bulletin-board

CHIEF INSPECTOR
(continuing)
That is why Canyon Mack is
permitted to roam our streets
(taps PIGEONSHIT photo
with POINTER again)
That is why France is overflowing
with deviants Like this one

The camera quickly pans from the PIGEONSHIT photo to the one
next to it This photo is of PIERRE PIERRE (with a ridiculous
“Just got out of bed” expression)

CHIRP—INSPECTOR inn ee cere eee ne

(taps the PIERRE photo

with pointer)
His name is Pierre Pierre

(strolls away from board

again)
But unlike his friend Canyon Mack
Pierre indulges in a deviancy that
is uniquely french He negates
everything he doesn’t bathe he
doesn’t brush his teeth he’s cruel
to his girlfriend and he’s a
coward among cowards In many ways
he is a bigger menace than Canyon
Mack

(MORE)

CHIEF INSPECTOR (contd)
Because Pierre Pierre is the dark
underbelly of France He is our
national anti-conscience and I aim
to rectify this I aim to destroy

merriment

SCUMBAG
(making a sourpuss face)
I believe there is a hair in my
pie

PIERRE
(ignoring her reading
from book)
“If a mass death sentence defines
the human condition then
rebellion in one sense is its

he rejects his mortality the rebel
refuses to recognize the power that
compels him to live in this
condition The metaphysical rebel
is therefore not definitely an
atheist as one might think but he
is inevitably a blasphemer Quite
simply he blasphemes primarily in
the name of order denouncing God
as the father of death and as the
supreme outrage”

contemporary At- the same time thater nr we

SCUMBAG
(impatient pouty)
Didn’t you hear me Pierre There’s

shoulders faster closer to the beat LUC comes back out and
with a “great dancing” expression he starts dancing like
the spaziest of goons SCUMBAG is overjoyed by this and
starts dancing with LUC emulating his goonish moves

(to PIGEONSHIT)
Im getting the fuck out of here
old man

PIGEONSHIT
(reaching out to PIERRBS)
Youre gonna take me with
youright man

We hear a gunshot PIGEONSHITs expression is one of wide-
eyed horror We infer that he has been shot though’‘he still
looks at PIERRE

PIERRE
No Pigeonshit I hate a lie I
told you before you will die
alone And die alone you shall

PIERRE walks away PIGEONSHIT melts to the floor and makes a
weepy death rattle sound

SCUMBAG looks at the dying PIGEONSHIT and after some
hesitation she bends down and takes his gun She then
follows PIERRE ’

PIERRE and SCUMBAG making their way down a hallway

CHIEF INSPECTOR (0S)
Freeze you deviants

PIERRE
(to himself)

Must every person on Earth fuck 700 T
with me Truly man is made in Gods
image

PIERRE and SCUMBAG turn around
The CHIEF INSPECTOR is standing there gun pointed

CHIEF INSPECTOR
It is over Pierre Pierre
(he takes a step forward)
And I do not refer solely to your
life but to everything you
represent

PIERRE
(defiantly blase)
Originality is not a swine’s strong-
suit eh

CHIEF INSPECTOR guffaws

CHIEF INSPECTOR

(smiling)
No It is not Your type always had
the originality

(smile leaves) ot
Oh I am quite familiar with your
type Pierre Pierre Spending your
afternoons in the cinematheque
your nights reading poetry over the
naked bodies of the women youve
bedded Always drinking and
smoking polluting every boulevard
But not just with smoke You also
pollute with your existentialism
your rebellion for rebellion’s
sake It was not énough that God
was dead to your kind you had to
resurrect Him and make Him a
tyrant

(with his free hand he

‘clenches a fist)
Because your type feels worthless
you must make everything around you
worthless Misery where others find
happiness Negation where so many
find safety Anything that is
built by a majority must be
bombarded with your envious
contempt You shit on work You
shit on religion You shit on the
Americans who were one great

friends to” our Nation and “Gare not
for the consequences My cousin

Monsieur John Kerry no longer

returns my calls I am a Frenchman

so it is assumed I am radical

lecherous and godless And it’s all

because of you Pierre Pierre You

you you

CHIEF INSPECTOR gnashes his teeth together then collects
himself

CHIEF INSPECTOR
(continuing extending
weapon)
(MORE)
CHIEF INSPECTOR (contd)
But it is over You are an
endangered species Pierre Pierre
The last of the hipsters you might
say In a few seconds my bullet
from my gun will be going into your
face and you will be dead Do you
have any declaration to make
Pierre Pierre Perhaps a final and

futile stab at the status-quo Or a

calm puff from your cigarette
wrought with profound resignation
That would be very Pierre Pierre
would it not

There’s a moment of silence then

PIERRE
I am the enemy you would kill my
friend
CHIEF INSPECTOR
Huh

CUT TO

INT THE FAIRBORN CHATEAU FOYER - MOMENTS LATER

A single slow-motion shot of PIERRE and SCUMBAG aiming their
weapons and firing The furious crescendo of “Cargo Culte”
blares with a looping sound-bite of Burt Reynolds’s Bandit
laugh We never see who or what surrounds them They shoot in
all directions but its done with a liquidity that brings to
mind the surgical precision of a ballet they become the axis
in a globe of gunfire After several moments of this the
music fades and they lower their guns

PIERRE and SCUMBAG stand in the foyer surrounded by a
shitload of dead bodies He smokes as usual She looks over
the carnage with an even colder expression than before After
several drags from his cig PIERRE raises his head to a
corner of the foyer There in the shadows lurks the CAT IN
WHEELCHAIR PIERRE walks over to the cat points his gun at
it

PIERRE

PIERRE turns around

SCUMBAG is aiming her gun at him

PIERRE
Whats this

SCUMBAG
(cold mechanical)
I must kill you

PIERRE
I suppose I should ask “why” now
Very well Why Scumbag Why must

SCUMBAG
It says so in the script

With her free hand SCUMBAG hands PIERRE a script

He looks down at it

A screenplay entitled Pierre Pierre (PIERRE’S POV)

BACK TO
PIERRE facing SCUMBAG again

PIERRE
To fuck with your post-modernism

ground angrily)

some script tells you to do it

That’s just weak shit And to

in public

SCUMBAG

can take many things from you I
can take your insults I can take
your cruelty But there is one
thing I don’t think I can take
(beat)
--Your love

PIERRE

Fair enough

(takes a drag straightens

his shoulders)
I knew this would happen as soon as
I returned your love Go ahead
Shoot me Michelle Give me some
death

SCUMBAG aims the gun at PIERRE’s face Her look is one of
concentrated effort

PIERRE makes a series of goofy faces mimicking the very
goofy faces she made at him when they first embarked on their
road trip

The gun shakes in SCUMBAG’s hands Her eyes start to water

SCUMBAG
(emotion returning)
Oh Pierre
(she casts away the gun)
--I cannot shoot you I love you
too much

They embrace and for the first time we see them kiss each

‘other “with passion “and affection’ Serge Gainsbourg’s “Je
N’Avais Qu’un Seul Mot A Lui Dire” Plays After the kiss
PIERRE backs way

PIERRE
(squinting in disgust)
God your breath is rank Have you
been giving blowjobs to Arab
refugees

SCUMBAG
(rolling her eyes
smiling)
Now there’s my Pierre

PIERRE
And you are my Scumbag

the window
