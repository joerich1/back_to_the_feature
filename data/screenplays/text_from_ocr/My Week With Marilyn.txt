It is 1956 Saltwood Castle the family home of the Clark
family looms over the landscape framed by the setting

COLIN bounds up the stairs into the Library

3B INT SALTWOOD CASTLE LIBRARY DAY 3B
As COLIN enters he sees SIR KENNETH CLARK standing in

of a painting on an easel by the Italian Baroque painter
Annibale Carracci He has two STUDENTS with him a man and

woman in their early 20s and is in mid-description of the
painting

KENNETH
Â» and this is one of Carraccis
earlier works and one is able to
see the emergence of his now famous
Baroque style which is clearly
rooted in the tradition of high
renaissance and antiquity
COLIN pauses briefly and hurries towards them Throughout

scene there is a sense of his urgency and desire to go The
whole thing should be played at breakneck pace KENNETH

affectionately
KENNETH
Colin Come in Have you met James
and Anna Two very brilliant
pupils
He has the avuncular air of a benign academic affable and

little eccentric COLIN smiles hurriedly at the students
no
time to waste

COLIN
Im leaving for London now Pa

KENNETH
Ah yes Well bon chance dear
boy
He puts a friendly arm around COLINs shoulder and starts
to
walk him back to the door

KENNETH

I can always get you a research

position at the VandA when youve

grown up a bit and got this film

idea out of your system

COLINs smiles but before he can reply JANE CLARK whirls
into

the room a ball of energy talking nineteen to the dozen

JANE
Kenneth you might have told Cook
we were another two for dinner
What is everyone supposed to eat
Cabbage soup Oh Colin darling

dozen things at once

JANE strides across the lawn with COLIN rushing to catch

JANE
Cant you stay for dinner Theres

conversation will be charming

COLIN
I dont want to be late in the
morning
As COLIN hurries after JANE he is nearly run down by an
elderly GARDENER with a lawn mower and has to take

evasive action JANE doesnt notice

JANE
Im sure they wont mind Youll be
a famous film director in no time
I know your fathers put in a word

COLIN
I wish he hadnt done that I can
manage on my own
She stops so abruptly he nearly slams into her JANE looks
around the garden with a frown

JANE
I have to watch Jenkins like a
hawk One more of his murderous
prunings and well lose the tea
roses for ever
And shes off again with COLIN still following He cant
help smiling at the madness of it all

house

of

The sun is setting casting a golden glow over the castle
COLIN and JANE emerge from the front door COLIN pauses in
the driveway and dumps his bag in the back of his old but
racy MG Sports car Only now does JANE really turn her
attention fully to him for the first time

JANE
Now go and have a lovely time
darling Were always here when
youre ready to talk your future
COLIN wants to protest but before he can get the words out
JANE sees a YOUNG GARDENER walking at the side of the house
with a wheel barrow Her face lights up

JANE
Mullins Be an angel - find Cook
and ask her how many pork chops we
need for tonight Then bring the
car round I must get to the
village before the shop shuts
She dashes away after the GARDENER turning back as an
afterthought to blow a kiss at COLIN as she goes
COLIN smiles then pauses for a moment to look at the

We can sense both his affection for it but more pressingly
his need to get away

He gets in puts the car in gear and the Bristol pulls out
the drive and across the moat In the last rays of the sun
the countryside looks magical but Colin only has eyes for

the road ahead

A sharp contrast with the hazy beauty of the countryside
It is early morning in the heart of Londons West End The
streets hum with activity as OFFICE WORKERS in hats and
raincoats stream from the tube stations

COLIN pushes his way through the early morning crowds in
Piccadilly This is his patch he is very much at home
here negotiating the busy streets with ease As he passes
by the upmarket Burlington Arcade a TAILOR pauses in
measuring a suit for a client to give him a familiar wave
COLIN waves back

19 INT 144 PICCADILLY RECEPTION AREA DAY 19

A new morning COLIN perches restlessly on the sofa
Despite his modest triumph he is back where he started The
seconds pass in dull silence He is beginning to think his
campaign will fail But then in a heartbeat everything
changes

He looks up in surprise as the door bursts open and SIR
LAURENCE OLIVIER strides in with his wife VIVIEN LEIGH on
his arm
MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 10

At the age of 49 SIR LAURENCE OLIVIER is at the peak of his
fame He is handsome and charismatic and VIVIEN is
scarcely less extraordinary The Gone With The Wind star
remains classically lovely flirtatious and captivating
Individually they are charismatic enough but together they
are electrifying seeming to charge the air around them
with the power of their personalities galvanising anyone
who comes into contact with them

VANESSA leaps to her feet and PERCEVAL hurries to greet
them as COLIN stands up uncertainly OLIVIER is all amiable
bluster and bonhomie

OLIVIER

Do you know Hughie it is simply

impossible to get Marilyn Monroe on

the telephone The darling girl

spends the entire day asleep But

great beauty has its way
He laughs but then notices VIVIENs less than enthusiastic
response Seeking refuge in some distraction he notices
COLIN hovering by the sofa

OLIVIER (CONTD)
Hello boy remind me
He smiles vaguely and glances at VIVIEN for help

VIVIEN
You remember Colin darling You
met him at the Clarks party

OLIVIER

(NO IDEA)
Of course What are you doing
here

COLIN

You said there might be a job on

your film
OLIVIER has no recollection of this and fumbles in his
pockets to cover his confusion bringing out a packet of
cigarettes and offering them to COLIN with breezy charm

OLIVIER
Have a cigarette Keep the pack

He turns quickly to PERCEVAL

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 11
OLIVIER (CONTD)
There wont be any film unless
Miss Monroe gets her splendid
posterior out of bed

PERCEVAL
The House Committee are
threatening to withhold Millers
passport They say hes a
communist No Arthur no Marilyn

OLIVIER
Ill have a word with the
American ambassador Im taking
him to see Vivien in South Sea

Bubble on Thursday now tell
me Hughie are Terrys rewrites
in

He puts an arm around PERCEVALs shoulders and they
disappear together into Percevals office

VIVIEN lingers behind smiling radiantly at COLIN who looks
dumbly at the packet of cigarettes in his hand He now sees
they are called Oliviers VIVIEN wrinkles her nose in
amusement

VIVIEN

They named them after Larry The

first actor since Du Maurier to

have his own brand and they pay

him an absolute fortune (Pause)

Im afraid theyre rather

ghastly

She cups Colins cheeks with her hands and studies him in
mock awe

VIVIEN (CONTD)
Isnt he gorgeous Vanessa

VANESSA
I suppose hes all right
VIVIENs eyes sparkle OLIVIER emerges from the office with

handful of script pages and VIVIEN looks at him slyly
getting her own back for his tactless over-praise of

Marilyns charms as she strokes COLINs cheek

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 12
VIVIEN

(TO COLIN)
Lets elope together and have the
most glorious affair (Arch) Oh
but then whod look after my
poor Larry
Olivier glances over with a faint look of exasperation
VIVIEN winks at COLIN and takes her husbands arm

VIVIEN (CONTD)
Now darling you must do
something for Colin You
absolutely promised
OLIVIER looks hunted There is no way out He glances back
at PERCEVAL as he comes in

OLIVIER
Lets try to find him something
to do Hughie
COLIN grins in triumph VIVIEN smiles at him

VIVIEN
You will take care of my precious
Larrykins wont you
She flirtatiously offers up her cheek for COLIN to kiss
COLINs smile falters as he sees PERCEVAL looking at him
grimly

20 INT 144 PICCADILLY HUGH PERCEVALS OFFICE DAY 20

COLIN stands eagerly at PERCEVALs desk PERCEVAL looks at
him more than usually brusque

PERCEVAL
Arthur Jacobs Miss Monroes
publicist is flying in tomorrow
He wants to see the house shell
be staying in Find something
suitable

20 ALT INT 144 PICCADILLY HUGH PERCEVALS OFFICE DAY ALT

COLIN knocks and walks into Percevals office carrying a
closed

fold-

up

the

tray with tea and a plate of biscuits The blinds are
and a 16mm projector is running silent images play on a

up screen in the corner of the room

Framed in the light of the projector are PERCEVAL and the
films lighting cameraman JACK CARDIFF They take no notice
of Colin

He looks up at the screen The two men are watching make-

hair and wardrobe tests for the film MARILYN MONROE in
character as Elsie Marina

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 12A

The film shows Marilyn looking sweet and pretty chatting
silently to someone just off camera mugging playfully in
costume larking about with her hair - and then when she
wants to turning on her full film star wattage and looking
wonderful every inch the beautiful icon

It is an intimate glimpse of her at work Colin watches
fascinated completely forgetting why hes there still
holding the tray -

PERCEVAL
(TO CARDIFF)

Larry says he particularly likes
this dress She looks radiant

CARDIFF
Exactly - we need to tone her down
a bit

PERCEVAL

How the hell do you tone down

Marilyn Monroe

COLIN laughs He immediately regrets it Both men turn to
look at him PERCEVAL turns off the projector and gazes at
him stonily

PERCEVAL
Marilyn Monroes publicist is
flying in tomorrow He wants to see
the house shell be staying in
Find something suitable
COLIN nods eagerly anxious to get out He is already at

door when PERCEVAL barks at him again

PERCEVAL
And leave the bloody tea
COLIN had forgotten the tray He blushes furiously puts it
down and hurries out

21 EXT COUNTRY ROAD DAY 21

COLIN has a map spread out on the bonnet of his Bristol
sports car He finds Pinewood Studios then draws a ring
around its circumference He taps his pencil thoughtfully
as he lights a cigarette - one of the branded pack that
Olivier gave him He inhales deeply thinking then
grimaces in distaste quickly stubbing it out under his
foot

JACOBS
That house was perfect for

PERCEVAL

COLIN
Yes we can I knew Cotes-Preedy

quiet
They stare to him in surprise He looks at them boldly

COLIN
When you asked me to find a house
for Miss Monroe I took the
precaution of finding two The
other one Parkside is much
better and the owner is very
discreet

PERCEVAL
But now we have two expensive
houses when we only wanted one
COLIN
I thought someone else on the
production might want it

PERCEVAL
Oh did you
There is a dangerous moment when things could go either
way COLIN has gambled everything in a bid to impress them

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 16

He waits in tense silence staring at their puzzled
expressions But then JACOBS shrugs

JACOBS
I guess Milton could use it Its
near the studio near Marilyn

PAULA

Marilyn has to prepare properly

She has to find in herself all

that lies under the surface

putting on a costume or some

ludicrous false nose

watch one of OLIVIERs speeches (from the The Coconut
Girl sequence we saw filming in Scenes 61 and 62) He is
dry and clipped every take precise and professional It is
an effective but theatrical performance

MARILYN sneaks in with ARTHUR MILLER They sit in the back
row watching her performance from the same scene She
fluffs take after take gets her words wrong and pauses
looking dazed COLIN notices her clutching MILLERs hand
tightly But finally a good take comes up She is charming
and natural and her performance suddenly makes OLIVIERs
look stiff and clumsy MILLER smiles in relief and
reassurance

MILLER
That ones pretty damn good You
knocked it out of the park
MARILYN glows at his praise

MILTON
When Marilyn gets it right you
just dont want to look at anyone
else
OLIVIER frowns For all his greatness as an actor he will
never be a film star like the maddeningly instinctive
Marilyn And the injustice of it is like a stab through his
heart
At the back COLIN only has eyes for the screen He watches
MARILYNs image enthralled Until now he has taken Marilyn
entirely at Oliviers valuation but as he watches her on
screen he begins to see things differently

He shrugs awkwardly

MARILYN (CONTD)

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 63

COLIN hesitates It seems pointless to deny it

COLIN
He was worried about you

MARILYN
Are you spying on me

COLIN
No Of course not Why would
anyone spy on you
She sighs and looks away

COLIN (CONTD)
Are you all right Miss Monroe

He waits hesitantly but she seems to have drifted off

then suddenly she turns back to him her eyes huge

MARILYN
Colin Whose side are you on
COLIN stares at her She looks utterly beautiful and

But
vulnerable in the shadowy light There is only one answer
anyone could give

COLIN
Yours Miss Monroe
She rewards him with a brilliant smile her whole face
lighting up

MARILYN
Call me Marilyn
He is suddenly overwhelmed by a rush of sympathy She looks
so lost and vulnerable Perhaps he means it Perhaps he is
on her side now

winks at him

90 INT PINEWOOD STUDIOS SOUND STAGE DAY 90

MARILYN is finally back on the set filming a solo dance
routine Released from the need to remember any words she
takes refuge in the physical activity undulating sexily in
her tight white dress in a performance which is gawky
mildly silly and charming all at the same time

The dance is deliberately a little amateurish Elsie Marina
isnt meant to be any sort of superstar But she radiates
joy and innocence and sheer happiness in the dance and
MARILYN captures all this perfectly Within the scene the
actor JEREMY SPENSER playing Nicky watches from the
doorway

Everyone watches silently from behind the camera No one
can look away least of all COLIN It feels like one purely
joyful moment in the agony the film has become and Marilyn
is radiant Even OLIVIER has a reluctant half-smile on his
face as he watches

The stage is empty except for OLIVIER and MILLER They sit
in a pool of light in the cavernous room COLIN pours
whisky for them and then steps back into the shadows Both
men ignore him He is too unimportant to worry about
MILLER leans forward holding his pipe but not smoking it

MILLER
I dreamed last night I could hear
singing And then I realised it
wasnt a dream There was a male
voice choir serenading Marilyn
under our window At two in the
morning Its a circus A freak
show
OLIVIER smiles but MILLER looks dazed

MILLER (CONTD)
Im going back to New York for a
few days I need to see my kids
I need a break

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 65

OLIVIER
That wont help Marilyn

MILLER
(After a moment)
I cant help her (Pause) You
know what she loves to do most
Sleep Its what she lives for
Sleep is her demon
He pauses for a second

MILLER (CONTD)
Ive disappointed her
OLIVIER looks at him MILLER shakes his head

MILLER (CONTD)

She thought I could smash all her

insecurities with one magical

stroke That I could make her a

new person
He pauses for a second weighing every word carefully

MILLER (CONTD)
She wants me to protect her but I
cant I cant even protect
myself (Pause) She read some
notes I made They were nothing
Just a few ideas

OLIVIER
About her
He looks up and nods slowly

MILLER
She took them the wrong way
He leaves a long uneasy pause

OLIVIER
But you do love her Your new
bride and all that
MILLER plays with his whisky

Forgotten in the shadows COLIN listens attentively to

everyone from the lowest chippie to the Heads of

at her elbow The crew crowd around her She is easy and
relaxed relishing every second of their attention

VIVIEN

dreadful slave driver he can be
She sees ORTON and takes his hands

VIVIEN (CONTD)

misery

She laughs and turns to COLIN looking at him severely

VIVIEN
Now you are looking after Larry

COLIN

VIVIEN glances away to see MARILYN standing nearby awkward
and excluded She has come straight from make-up and wears
only a towelling robe slippers and curlers in her hair

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 67

Compared to VIVIEN she looks frumpish VIVIEN glides
towards her hands extended

VIVIEN
Darling Marilyn
She kisses her on both cheeks and holds her hands

VIVIEN (CONTD)
Larry tells me you are quite
quite superb Im wild with
jealousy

MARILYN
Oh but everyone says you were a
wonderful Elsie on stage

VIVIEN
But Im too old to play her in
the film Larry was quite brutal
about that You see the truth is
all that matters to him Thats
why we all admire him so very
much
She glances at OLIVIER with a fluttering laugh He smiles
back with a haunted look in his eyes

VIVIEN (CONTD)
Now I must let you work I only
came to wish you good luck
Goodbye everyone
The crew press around her MARILYN watches feeling more
than ever the odd one out COLIN watches her from the edge
of the crowd She cuts a lonely vulnerable figure He is
totally preoccupied with her so much so that when VIVIEN
comes up behind him he turns guiltily as though caught out
VIVIEN stares at him All her exuberance has vanished and
she looks suddenly tired and older It as though the facade
of a beautiful building is beginning to crack She gazes at
him with bitter disappointment

VIVIEN (CONTD)
Oh Colin Not you too
He wants to protest but VIVIEN is already turning away

She looks at him venomously a dangerous unbalanced hatred
seething in her expression

In one way yes But when youre

achievers its hard to make your

She looks at him sympathetic but pushing a little harder

MARILYN
So how are you going to do it

COLIN
Maybe it will be in films but if
not there are so many
possibilities out there

as she tries to dry herself COLIN goes to take her in his
arms

COLIN
Let me warm you up
She snuggles into him gratefully her teeth chattering He
rubs her naked back briskly her thin blouse the only
barrier between their bodies Slowly his embrace becomes
more sensual his hands slowing stroking rather than
rubbing his face buried in her hair his arms pulling her

CLOSER -

date
He tries to kiss her but she ducks her head away gently
her expression wistful

MARILYN (CONTD)

I havent had a real date since I

was 13 years old

She suddenly looks much younger her smile a poignant echo
of a lost childhood

He steps back politely allowing her to put on her blouse
As she buttons it she gazes at him then impulsively leans
forward to kiss him chastely on the lips The kiss is as
sweet and innocent as any 13 year old might wish

The kiss lasts for a few seconds their lips touching
gently the river shimmering magically in the sunshine
behind them When they finally break apart she rewards him
with a radiant smile

That was nice I dont get kissed
much

A flicker of terror crosses MARILYNs face COLIN turns on
them angrily

COLIN
You heard what she said She
wants me here

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 106

MILTON looks at him grimly but finally surrenders the
field Paula is more reluctant to give in She sits on the
bed stroking Marilyns hand

PAULA

You have no idea of your position

in the world Marilyn You are the
greatest actress theres ever been

Not just actress The greatest

woman of this or any time I love

you like a daughter
COLIN is surprised to see tears in her eyes

PAULA (CONTD)

Its hard now but believe me you

will survive this and go on to

better things Your life is ahead

of you Youre young just

beginning

Paulas love and sincerity are obvious She means it COLIN
watches her in silence MARILYN squeezes her hand and PAULA
gets up with a heavy sigh bitterly reluctant to leave
Finally she drags herself out leaving them alone
As the door closes MARILYN curls herself up in the bed

MARILYN
Im so tired of feeling scared
Life is so shitty I hate it It
hurts too much
COLIN looks at her his heart breaking at her anguish

COLIN
Im here now Ill look after
you
She gives him a wry look teasing but thoughtful

MARILYN

Good old Colin Looking after me

looking after Larry looking after

Vivien Always putting everyone

before yourself
There is an edge to this He gazes at her shaken but she
smiles and touches his face gently
He gets on the bed fully clothed to fold her in his arms

frightened COLIN sees a dark red stain on the sheets

MILTON gives him a sharp look but he no longer cares about
anything except Marilyn There is a shuffling sound and the
door is unlocked At the same moment PAULA comes rushing
in hair awry gown flapping a wild look in her eye
PAULA
Marilyn Marilyn my baby what
has Colin done to you

COLIN
I havent done anything Shes

He reddens with embarrassment ROGER coughs

I think he means her monthlies

COLIN
Shes not dying for Christs

The HOUSEKEEPER now appears at the door with an elderly man
at her side He nods briskly

CONNELL
Im Dr Connell Is the patient
in there

PAULA
Please save her its Marilyn

CONNELL calmly extracts himself from her grasp

bitterly

CONNELL gives them a wry look and shrugs

When this film is over Im going

He is close to tears suddenly looking very young She
looks at him with a sad sweet smile He shakes his head
stubbornly taking her hand in passionate appeal

COLIN (CONTD)
You could quit Forget Marilyn
Monroe forget Hollywood Let it
all go

MARILYN
This is what Ive worked for my
whole life I couldnt just give

it all up

COLIN
Why not when it drives you
crazy

Her eyes widen in surprise A flicker of nervous insecurity
dulls her expression

MARILYN
You think Im crazy

COLIN
I didnt mean that I just meant
you could be happy

MARILYN
I am happy I got everything I
ever dreamed about
She smiles tentatively but he sees a terrible fear in her
eyes He looks down realising with a cruel stab of pain
that Olivier was right There is no way back She doesnt

want to be rescued
He finally looks up smiling despite the tears in his eyes

COLIN
Of course youre happy (Pause)
Youre a star The biggest star
in the world
She smiles reassured He drags himself off the bed and
goes to the door pausing for a second as he looks back

side and MILTON on the other She looks exactly as Marilyn
should With her white dress shimmering in the lights and

She sweeps past only inches away from Colin but ignores

He cant help feeling a stiletto sharp pang of regret

smiles around blinking in the lights She looks for comfort
or support among the technicians but sees only blank faces

sullen hostility She smiles nervously

MARILYN (CONTD)
I hope you will all forgive me It
wasnt altogether my fault I have
been ill

She smiles up at their uneasy expressions struggling to
understand herself and their expectations of her

She sings with touching delicacy nailing it perfectly

is pin drop silence on the set as the crew watch COLIN is
amongst them It is a moment of almost unbearable poignancy
for him He suddenly realises that SYBIL THORNDIKE has
up silently behind him to watch the scene As he turns to
her

she smiles with infinite wisdom and compassion murmuring

softly so that only he can hear

SYBIL THORNDIKE
First love is such sweet despair

She touches his cheek gently and smiles perhaps lost ina
long ago memory of her own before retreating quietly into
the darkness at the back of the set

COLIN sits with the phone to his ear The sound of Marilyn
singing the Sleeping Prince Waltz dies away and we realise
has been revisiting it in his memory

He waits as long as he can but it is obvious no one is

to answer In the end he puts the receiver back in its

in resignation

His gaze drifts up to a shelf stacked with film cans He
stands up and looks through them blowing dust away they
have been here for a long time ignored He finds the one

is looking for - it says simply MM on the can
He takes the short reel of film and threads it through a
Movieola in the corner of the room He turns it on and

to look
The screen bursts into life with an image of MARILYN at her
most vital and captivating It is a copy of some rushes

The Prince And The Showgirl perhaps given to Colin by
Olivier or perhaps borrowed as a souvenir and long since
forgotten

We see MARILYN dancing happily exaggerating off camera
looking playful and sexy She is radiant and full of life
After a moment she turns and looks off camera - perhaps to
where Colin himself would have been standing - and winks
happily

Blown up to the full size of the screen it is utterly sweet
and charming

There is something so completely natural about the gesture
COLIN feels he has been swept back seven years in time and
MARILYN is standing in front of him again in the flesh It
moves and delights him perhaps he has never even really

seen

this clip before At any rate he hasnt thought about it
for

years

It is MARILYN as he will always remember her relaxed

affectionate and vital a part of her however tiny

She smiles laughs at something giggles in delight
(without

looks back smiling at the camera
