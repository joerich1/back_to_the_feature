CHARLIE MACKENZIE in his late twenties wearing a flannel

EXT CITY LIGHTS BOOKSTORE - NIGHT

Charlie puts the CLOSED sign on the door and proceeds to
walk home

EXT SAN FRANCISCO STREETS

The sights and the sounds of the city are accentuated by the
BEBOP as he sees life warts and all As the streets become
less populated he can now hear the sounds of his own
FOOTSTEPS and a COUPLE BICKERING The streets become even
more deserted The night is closing in on him A cat darts
out from an alleyway and startles him He quickens his pace
RUMBLINGS make him cross the street to avoid the danger
Headlights of a slow moving car approach from the distance
Charlie frightened turns another corner onto

HIS STREET

He approaches a 3-story Victorian home in which he has an
apartment on the second floor he notices a light on in his
window A CRASHING sound from within

CUT TO
HANDS

taking papers out of a desk drawer

CUT TO
CHARLIE
carefully opening the front door and then gingerly closing
it He reaches for a baseball bat in a nearby umbrella stand
Sound of BREAKING GLASS from his apartment upstairs

CUT BACK TO
SHATTERED PICTURE FRAME
with a photo of Charlie and an angelic blonde

CUT BACK TO

CHARLIE

finishing off the last two steps nearing the front door of
his apartment bat raised above his head ready to swing

CUT TO
THE HANDS

clasp a jewelry box on the top of the dresser and stuff them
into a dufflebag the jewelry is followed by CDs

CUT TO
CHARLIE
pushing open his apartment door in a mock SWAT maneuver
then stealthily stalking toward the sound of the intruder in
the bedroom He stubs his toe on a spring loaded doorstop
making a loud metal VITTSWINGGGGs sound He freezes
terrified

CUT TO
THE BEDROOM
where the HANDS freeze
CUT BACK TO

CHARLIE

Like a coiled jungle cat ready to pounce waits two beats
then springs Samurai style into

THE BEDROOM
He freezes
REVERSE ANGLE TO REVEAL

that the HANDS belong to the angelic blonde in the broken
picture Its Charlies girlfriend SHERRI

CHARLIE
Sherri What are you doing

SHERRI
Im leaving you

CHARLIE
Oh thank God I thought you were
robbing our own home because frankly
thats insane I mean what could
you possibly gain by robbing your
own home I dont mean to meddle
but isnt it better to rob other
peoples homes Start accumulating
their wealth as opposed to just
reaccumulating your own wealth

SHERRI
Thats not funny Charlie Im really
leaving

She continues to pack Charlie tries to unpack her things

CHARLIE
What Just because we had a fight
last night

SHERRI
Weve had a fight every night for
two months Ever since I brought up
the subject of marriage youve found
fault with everything I do Why
couldnt we have gotten married
Charlie

CHARLIE
(beat)

Im too young to get married
(begins putting her
things back)
Im only twenty-nine and a half We
love living together

SHERRI
Its been two years now I need
something more

CHARLIE
See Sherri this is frustrating for
me Okay When we first started going
out I thought we agreed that we
werent the sort of people who got
married

SHERRI
Thats like saying were not the
sort of people who are going to grow
old Were not going to fall into
that growing old trap Face it
youve got a problem with commitment
Charlie Take a look at your other
girlfriends Every time you get close
to a commitment theres something
wrong with them

CHARLIE
Hey I broke up with them for good
reasons

SHERRI
What about Sandy

CHARLIE
Sandy was an alcoholic

SHERRI
No-no-no You thought she was an
alcoholic She just drank more than
you drank What about Jill

CHARLIE
She hated my family

SHERRI
You thought she hated your family
Nobody hates your family Everybody
loves your family What about Julie

CHARLIE
She smelled like soup

SHERRI
What does that mean

CHARLIE

She smelled exactly like Campbells
Beef Vegetable soup She was dirty
physically dirty

SHERRI
Well Charlie I wonder what youre
gonna say were my problems Are you
gonna tell your friends that I was a
junkie that I wasnt supportive
enough or that I smelled like relish
Charlie I loved you It could have
worked out

(she goes to the door)
Think about it

She leaves

fourteen year old little brother all singing

ALL

The group are eating dinner on TV trays Charlie walks over

(begins singing in
thick Scottish accent)
HEY DID YOU HAPPEN TO SEE THE MOST
BEAUTIFUL GIRL IN THE WORLD

STUART
May shut it

STUART MACKENZIE is in his late fifties a butcher with
Coke bottle glasses and thick head of black hair His red-
haired wife MAY is in her fifties attractive with a soft
but tough appearance Little WILLIAM has a very large head
and a skinny neck Like Charlie he was born in America

Charlie gives his Mom a hug his father a kiss

CHARLIE

WILLIAM
(on his stomach on
the floor watching
TV)

Heed Move

We see the re-play of the goal on TV Tony sits down and May
brings over a plate of stew and three types of potatoes
piled very high

MAY

CHARLIE
Enough to recreate Devils Tower in
Close Encounters

STUART
(sniffs the air)
Do I smell haggis

CHARLIE

MAY
(taking it)
Ill put it in the frig

Charlie notices Tony reading some papers He realizes its
literature from the Lyndon H LaRouche Society

CHARLIE
Dad what are you doing to Tony now
Why do you abuse his mind like this

STUART
Thats the latest report from Lyndon
H LaRouche outlining how the Queen
and the Rothschilds masterminded the
Soviet overthrow so that they could
reclaim lands they had annexed during
the Holy Roman Empire

TONY
(goading Charlie)
You know a lot of this makes sense

CHARLIE

I think youre suffering from the
Stockholm Syndrome where the hostages
start to relate to their captors

STUART
Listen Sonny Jim its a known fact
theres a society of the five
wealthiest people in the world called
the Pentaverate who run everything
and meet three times a year at a
secret country mansion in Colorado
known as The Meadows

CHARLIE
(sarcastic)
And thats obviously why we havent
heard about it in the newspapers

STUART

(inappropriately angry

and loud)
Thats right They fuckin own the
papers smartass And everything
else Why do you think Scotlands
not been able to get independence
Because the Queen the Pentavirate
and those English dome heads in West
Minster wont have it

CHARLIE
Who are the other members of this
pentaverate

STUART
The Queen the Rothchilds the Gettys
the Vatican and Colonel Sanders
before he went tits up Oh I hated
the Colonel with his wee beady eyes
And that smug look on his face

CHARLIE
Dad how can you hate the Colonel

STUART
Because the Colonel puts an addictive
chemical in it that makes you crave
it fortnightly

CHARLIE
Interesting coo-coo

STUART
But its not just the poetry is it

youll lose your muse Look at me I
was a strapping young butcher at
the height of my creative powers
When it came to de-boning a side of
beef there was nobody that could
touch me Then I married your mother
And people would still stand in awe
as I filleted a shoulder of lamb

MAY
Maybe its just as well not to get
married look at the news Where did
I put it

STUART
Heed Move that melon of yours into
the bathroom and get the paper for
your mother

William gets the National Enquirer and brings it back

CHARLIE

paper

STUART

fifth highest circulating paper in
the United States Ill have you
know

MAY
Oh here it is Mrs X The Honeymoon
Murderer She marries men under fake
identities and then murders them

We see a montage of a persons hands chopping a rack of lamb
into lamb chops and carving meat with surgical efficiency

HARRIET
(spotting Charlie in
the crowd)

Oh hi haggis right

CHARLIE
It was a big hit

HARRIET

(finishing up with a
customer)

I remember you told me you were
Scottish but do you really like
haggis

CHARLIE

No I think its repellent in every
way In fact I think most Scottish
cuisine is based on a dare

Harriet laughs

HARRIET

(to the next customer)
Can I help you

(to Charlie)
Sorry Im really busy

CHARLIE
Look um my dads a butcher do you
need a hand

HARRIET
Well actually Yes

CHARLIE

HARRIET
Trying to be a vegetarian

HARRIET

hot-dogs to stop people from becoming
vegetarians Theres got to be
something I can do to repay you

CHARLIE
You could take me to a nice romantic
dinner

EXT PIER - NIGHT

Charlie and Harriet are eating hot-dogs As Charlie puts the
relish on he smells the relish

CHARLIE
(sniffing the relish)
This reminds me of my ex-girlfriend

HARRIET
I hate talking about old
relationships

CHARLIE
Then lets not and say we did

HARRIET
(she laughs)
That was easy -- What a nice guy

Youve probably never done a mean
thing in your life
CHARLIE
Youd be surprised

HARRIET

(to his confused look)
Name me something bad youve done in
your life

CHARLIE
Are you kidding me

HARRIET
No Did you ever steal anything You

CHARLIE
Tell me something bad youve done
And it better be bad I mean evil

HARRIET
How evil

CHARLIE
Really evil

(thinks)
Like how many people have you brutally
murdered

HARRIET
Brutal is such a subjective word
I mean whats brutal to one person
might be totally reasonable to
another

Next to them is a German couple speaking German looking
through a coin-operated binocular He says something which
causes her to cry

CHARLIE
This just reminded her of that scene
in Brians Song

HARRIET
Actually he just proposed to her
Those are tears of joy

She lifts her soda to toast them

HARRIET
Prost

The man and woman smile and nod

MAN

He checks out her apartment On the wall there is a huge
poster of the BOARDWALK IN ATLANTIC CITY

CHARLIE
Hey you know what this apartment
needs A really large oversized poster
of Atlantic City

HARRIET
I used to live there Thats where I
had my first supermarket job

bed that is facing neither parallel nor perpendicular with
the wall It is just kind of there

HARRIET (0S)

(coming into room)

I only have chamomile I hope thats
all right

He looks at her and then at the Oddly-placed bed

HARRIET

Its North-South

(to his confused look)

For health reasons See I had
this friend he was a martial arts
expert Anyways he used to sleep
North-South I dont know Its a
martial arts thing and it just sort
of became a habit with me

CHARLIE

(walking into living

room)
You know Scotland has its own martial
arts Its called FUCKU Its mostly
head butting and kicking people when

Harriet starts laughing Then so does Charlie They lean
into each other Pretty close Too close even and when it
seems like theyre going to kiss Charlie suddenly gets
uncomfortable and looks at his watch

HARRIET
Late

CHARLIE
No No Not for me

HARRIET

HARRIET
Well you looked at your watch and
said it wasnt late for you I

checking watch)
Maybe it is late

She gets him his coat He starts to leave

CHARLIE
Look the truth is yes I hada
great time and Id like to kiss
you but if we do kiss then well
kiss on the couch and if we kiss on
the couch then well kiss in the
bedroom and once youre in the
bedroom -- Well the thing is I
always rush it And this time I feel
like maybe I should wait Maybe we
should let it build naturally and
grow instead of just immediately
spending the night together

HARRIET
I want to spend the night together

CHARLIE
They are both fast asleep
Suddenly she begins to speak

Charlies smile fades

(sold)
I have no problem with that

OK Tony Do you have the K673
form completed yet that street vendor
incident on Powell Street

Yes Captain
CAPTAIN
Tony do you mind my saying that you
seem a little down

TONY
Captain Its about my work About
being a policeman

CAPTAIN
Tony if theres anything wrong Im
here to listen

TONY
I know And thats whats irritating
youre too nice

CAPTAIN
Too nice

TONY
Yes Youre my captain for gods sakes
You should be constantly on my case
like the captain on Starsky and Hutch
Once a week you should routinely
haul my ass into your office accuse
me of being a maverick and complain
to me that youre sick and tired of
defending my screwball antics to the
commissioner

CAPTAIN
Well as you may know Tony I dont
report to a commissioner I report
to a committee some of whom are
appointed some elected and the
remainder co-opted on a bi-annual
basis A quorum --

TONY
Police work should be all about
running around following up crazy
hunches that turn out to be right
going out on a limb

CAPTAIN
Well Tony Ive never seen it that
way For me police work is all about
following procedure and remaining
accountable to the general public

TONY

(exasperated)
Captain When I joined the police
force I thought I was going to be
Serpico and unfortunately I ended up
being Toma I would have settled for
Beretta

CAPTAIN
Thats interesting Tony Im perturbed
that you should be so disillusioned

Charlie enters

CHARLIE
Hey Tony I gotta talk to you

CAPTAIN
Oh hello Charlie Look Im in the
way here You guys probably have
something you want to talk about
and Tony if youve still got stuff
you want to sort out please you
know where the suggestion box is

The Captain exits

CHARLIE
Nice guy Hey whats up

TONY
Im having doubts about being a cop

They have doctors that deal
specifically with this illness

CHARLIE
Everythings adding up Tony One of
the victims was a martial arts expert
Last night at dinner she put a
martial arts move on my dad

TONY
There about twenty thousand people
in San Francisco who are martial
arts experts Should I arrest all of
them too

CHARLIE
If they also say Ralph in their sleep
I think itd be a good start
(showing him paper)
Ralph Elliot A plumber from San
Francisco Missing since his
honeymoon

TONY
Youre just getting scared Like the
dream you feel Harriet could be the
one so you start to suspect her of
things cause deep down youre scared
that if she is the one youll marry
and marriage to you is death

CHARLIE
Hey dont analyze my dreams okay
Theyre my dreams Analyze your own
dreams

(a beat)
Its not a marrying thing Tony
Its a murdering thing

(showing him paper)
Harriet lived in Atlantic City right
Well so did this guy right around
the same time she left town

COMPUTER ROOM AT POLICE STATION - MINUTES LATER

Charlie and Tony are in the back with KATHY a stocky black
woman in uniform who works in the files department

KATHY
Theres no record of any deaths All
three of these guys were reported
missing around the time of their
honeymoon but so were the wives No
pictures of any of the brides For
all we know they just picked up and
moved away

CHARLIE
And Ralph Elliot too

TONY
Charlie youre talking about three
guys over a seven year span Thats
hardly news No deaths Elopement in
this state as of this day is still
not illegal

CHARLIE

(re the article)
Yeah well murder is And this article
says that these men were murdered by
the same woman

KATHY
Mr MacKenzie weve found that
most National Enquirer articles are
actually based on our own police
reports They take the facts and
fabricate a story around them

TONY
Its true Charlie You gotta realize
that I mean personally I would

lie to you but Kathy has this
crazy notion of always telling the
truth

(patting his back)
You feel better now

CHARLIE
It guess so Its just if I hada
photo of Harriet I could show it to
the relatives or friends of Mrs Xs
victims to identify her

TONY
Charlie listen to me There is no

Mrs X Drop it Okay

INT HALLWAY - HARRIETS APARTMENT - EVENING
Charlie knocks on the door Rose answers

CHARLIE

Maybe I could wait

ROSE
Sure That would be fine

She then starts to slowly close the door He props it open
with his hand

CHARLIE
Inside I was hoping

ROSE

(letting him in)
Im glad you asked I didnt want to
be so forward I mean if youre
waiting inside then you feel
obligated to entertain me and keep
up the conversation just to be polite
and really your head might be totally
elsewhere and then theres the chance
that you would really want to talk
and its me whod be busy but in an
attempt not to be rude I sit there
and listen to some story that you
dont really want to tell and I dont
really have time to hear You know

CHARLIE
I couldnt agree with you more

ROSE
I think about a lot of things

CHARLIE
Look if you have work to do you go
right ahead

(ah heres an angle)
I mean to tell you the truth Id
love to see your work
ROSE
Okay What would you like me to do

CHARLIE
No I dont want to see you work I
was talking about your work Your

her composure

Stuart gives the Bagpiper the thumbs up The young people in
the room start to jam and then one by one the other guests
start getting into the swing of things The bagpipe man
continues playing It is clear that he is far too drunk to
play He slowly keels over drunk And as he falls over face
first he lands on his Bagpipes The bagpipes let out an

tortured animal The BAGPIPE WAIL extends into the next scene

INT CHARLES AND HARRIETS ROOM

Charlie and Harriet are all alone The voices trail off down
the hallway until they disappear Charlie and Harriet stare
at each other Harriet blocks the door Charlie looks around
the room The Axe The Corkscrew The letter opener The
fountain pen At this point everything in the room looks
like a potential weapon Harriet takes the axe

HARRIET

HARRIET

Suddenly the power goes off again Theyre both in the dark
A scuffle Charlie has restrained Harriet throws her ina
walk-in closet and locks it From behind the door we hear
Harriet WAILING Which continues

Charlie picks up the axe looks at it relieved at his lucky
escape He rushes to the door to escape He opens it and
standing there is Rose

CHARLIE
Aaaaah Rose I never thought Id be
so glad to see you

Rose smiles Charlie puts down the axe The lights flicker
back on

CHARLIE
(going to the phone)
Maybe the phones are working again
by now

He listens for a dial tone Beside the phone he sees a note
He starts to read is

CHARLIE
Dear Harriet I just cant handle
the commitment Im leaving you
Signed Charlie

And behind him Rose approaches with the axe raised

CHARLIE
What the hell is this I didnt write
this

And at that moment he turns to find the AXE BEING FLUNG
THROUGH THE AIR AT his head He ducks just in time

CHARLIE
What the fuck

She takes another swing and she hits the lamp off the desk
and the room is in complete DARKNESS

ROSE
Charlie Why did you marry Harriet
I warned you not to marry her didnt
I I warned all of them But none of
them listened to me They all went
ahead and married her Shes the

We stay in Charlies hip pocket as he tries to get away from
what he cant see He stays very silent

Then Rose strikes a match She lights a candle and comes
toward him He looks around The window is open And Charlie
is gone

EXT LEDGE - NIGHT

Charlie races along the slippery ledge almost falling at
several points Rose then appears on the roof holding the
Axe still

ROSE

(mostly to herself

slurring most words)
Charlie did you like your note I

Harriet willingly goes on the floor

HARRIET

Charlie

Tony slaps cuffs on her and takes her to the window

INT BEDROOM
Tony is standing with his back to the window between it and
Harriet She looks out of the window and screams

HARRIET
Look Its Charlie

From Harriets POV we see Charlie on the ledge edging along
He stops in horror when he sees Harriet glances back to the
pursuing Rose and rushes off

Tony looks behind him out the window Nobody is there

TONY
Nice try

HARRIET
I swear to you It was Charlie
Look Now theres Rose

Rose looks into the room with the axe in her hand

TONY
No you dont

HARRIET

(he glances at the
window)
Aaaaah Rose
INT LEVENSTEINS WINDOW
There is opera music playing Charlie rushes by past the
window There is a beat and he comes back staring inside in
amazement

REVERSE ANGLE

Mr Levenstein is in a Viking outfit Mrs Levenstein is in
full Norse Regalia

INT LEVENSTEINS WINDOW
Charlie gulps and rushes on hastily pursued by Rose

INT THE ROOF
Rose pulls the Axe back and swings and the momentum of the
swing pulls her feet out from under her and on the slippery
icy roof she falls and starts to slide

Just as shes about to go off the fifty foot high roof
Charlie climbs down the roof He stands over her Shes about
to slip Her hands are losing strength Her fingers are
slipping The rain is falling harder and harder

Charlie walks over to the cage where shes hanging on for
life

He leans down to help her up but just as he grabs on to her
hand the drainpipe shes holding onto slips

She is now dangling from the roof the rain falling harder
and harder Charlie now is nowhere near her He then gets
down on his knees on the roof and starts to climb down the
side of the drainpipe to get her

Rose looks up helplessly at him Not really asking for his
help Not denying it Shes accepted her fate

Policemen ambulances and spectators have gathered below in
bunches as Charlie climbs down the drainpipe he himself
hanging on for dear life

He just reaches out far enough to grab her hand and just as
he does her drainpipe tears and falls into the crowd below
Charlie then with all his strength -- his where has this

strength been my whole life strength -- pulls her up to the
roof next to him

Several policemen make their way onto the roof and come over
to where Charlie is detaining Rose The police take her
handcuff her and cart her away From the corner of the roof
appears Tony

TONY
I hate to bother you on your
honeymoon Charlie but

Charlie looks beyond Tony and sees Harriet standing in the
doorway He goes over and puts his arm around Harriet

CHARLIE
Thank God Im sorry I doubted you
but I thought you were the killer
but you were acting pretty strange

HARRIET
I thought you were going to leave
me like the others Thank God they
were just murdered I thought they
were always leaving me

Below Rose is put into a police car and taken off The SIRENS
disappear So do the crowds
