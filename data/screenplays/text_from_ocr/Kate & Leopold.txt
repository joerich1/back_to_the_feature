FADE IN
INT VICTORIAN ESTATE - 1895 - DAY

CLOSE UP Ornate antique GRANDFATHER CLOCK strikes

The credits begin to roll
Calligraphy place cards are painstakingly hand-written
preparation for a formal reception

Servants meticulously clean an elaborate crystal

Hands rapidly shine silver cutlery

Fresh flowers arranged in several enormous vases
INT KITCHEN - DAY

Kitchen clock strikes 215

Poultry plucked Feathers everywhere

Steaming copper pots boiling over Platters prepared
decorative garnish

Extravagant tiered cake is lavishly iced A glob of

enters a pair of puckered lips The perpetrator a fey
pompous HEAD VALET seriously considers the texture

flavor of the icing then gives the PASTRY CHEF a

sour look
The valet oblivious to the chefs fury gathers a

prepared

silver breakfast tray and checks his pocket watch

INT BEDROOM - DAY

Antique bedside table clock -- just past 215 The
valet

throws open velvet drapes sunlight FLOODS the room
revealing

a figure sleeping soundly in a massive oak framed bed
The

valet puts down the tray pulls back the quilt

The dozing figure gives the valet a deliberate angry
KICK

Flinching infinitesimally the valet crosses to the
closet

selects three suits and holds them up for inspection
From

beneath the puffiest of pillows AN EYE reluctantly
opens A

weary arm points decisively to the riding outfit

EXT ESTATE - DAY

The riding outfit is adorned by LEOPOLD Duke of
Albany a

dashing virile man in his 30s GALLOPING with great
abandon

he expertly leads his horse up hills and over hedges
He

sends gardeners shaping the grounds fleeing from his
path

In the background lanterns are being strung throughout
the

estate Rugs are beaten out of open windows

INT HALLWAY - EVENING

Large hallway clock -- 615 A pair of boots track a
freshly

scrubbed floor as Leopold heads carelessly up the
stairway

Three steps behind the valet snaps his fingers

Guests fill the ballroom in formal attire

INT BEDROOM - NIGHT

Leopold stares haughtily into a full length mirror
He wears only dotted linen drawers and a black silk top
of the period He flexes slightly The valet hastily
a corset around his mid-section from behind

Leopold eyes his reflection seductively He becomes

He turns to his right The valet spoons sorbet from a
saucer into his mouth He turns back to the mirror to

himself eat The valet pats his mouth dry

He affects a pampered STRUT crossing the room as the
sprays a mixture of perfume and powder into the air
thrusts out his arms walking through the mist turns

saunters back to his favorite place in front of the

Finally as if weighing a great decision Leopold hands
hat to his valet and nods firmly into the mirror

Leopold

A cream suede glove stitched in black slides over his

A perfect tight bow tie is tied around his neck

An elegant black tuxedo jacket with silk facings and
to the knees is fitted to his torso

His hair is sleeked with oil and centrally parted
His eyebrows are brushed with a tiny silver comb
His cheeks are pinched

A red silk handkerchief is placed in the bosom of his

Leopold stares into the mirror The effect is DAZZLING
raises one eyebrow Then in a voice you could pour
waffle

LEOPOLD
You dance like a herd of cattle
Miss Fairchild You are a rare woman
who lights up the room simply by
leaving it

He bows As he rises the reflection of Leopolds UNCLE
a pampered effectual man in his 60s appears behind
in the looking glass

UNCLE OTTO
Tell me Leopold do you plan to join
us downstairs after completing this
one-sided flash of wit

LEOPOLD
I despise affairs of this sort Uncle
Otto No one really listens to anyone
else If you attempt it you will
see why

UNCLE OTTO
You judge everything too severely I
wonder what would happen if you were
to cast that critical eye inward
Leopold

LEOPOLD
You do not wonder at all You merely
ask in order to state your own
opinion

UNCLE OTTO
We are all concerned about you

LEOPOLD
Ahh here it comes

UNCLE OTTO
Your life does not seem to have any
direction At the age of 25 a man is
too young to do anything well At 35
he is too old Now is your time to
take action Tell me what is it you
want to DO with your life

LEOPOLD
(wearily)
I do not know

UNCLE OTTO

(just as weary)
Your ignorance cramps my conversation

(he slaps Leopolds

face twice rather

quickly)
Wake up This is your one and only
life Every man has the chance to
make a difference DO something

stung takes a moment to compose himself

LEOPOLD
I am most grateful for your
surveillance and for your sympathy
I assure you there is no need for
concern I am as effectual and
attentive as my position allows

UNCLE OTTO
Life is not position Leopold It is
action
(he straightens
Leopolds tie)
I will see you downstairs promptly
In the appropriate frame of mind
He leaves Leopold stares into the mirror snaps his

fingers

The valet hands him a glass and pours a small shot of
brandy

Leopold shoots him a look The valet fills the glass
higher

Leopold drains the glass and heads to the doorway He

hesitates taking a deep breath and a long pause
Finally

THE VALET
(grandly)
Go spread joy

Without looking back Leopold leaves the room

INT BALLROOM - NIGHT

Music fills the air as the creme de la creme of
Victorian

society gather inside Leopold holds a prearranged
dance

card He looks at the names and finds his first partner
is

MISS TREE Leopold looks upward helplessly at an
unrelenting

God

INT BALLROOM DANCE FLOOR - NIGHT

A profoundly self-conscious Leopold dances
energetically

into frame with MISS TREE an ancient elfin yet
amazingly

SPRY woman who gapes up at him searchingly unblinking

Leopold opens his mouth to speak can think of nothing

suitable to say and clamps his mouth shut They dance
out

of frame

INT BALLROOM DANCE FLOOR - NIGHT

Leopold dances into frame with CLARA a BEAUTIFUL girl
of

19 He glances at her and smiles She titters turning
away

shyly They whirl around the dance floor His smile
grows

into a broad grin Caught up in the excitement Clara
beams
inky

of
difficulty he

except

She

around

realizes

up at him happily revealing a mouth full of missing
teeth
Leopold face frozen in a formal smile dances on
INT BALLROOM DANCE FLOOR - NIGHT
Leopold lumbers into frame with MISS FAIRCHILD a woman
immense girth With great dignity and extreme
maneuvers her around the floor looking everywhere
her enormous bosom
LEOPOLD

You dance like an angel Miss

Fairchild You light up the room I

thank you
Miss Fairchild curtseys heavily Leopold glances at his
sees the name Miss Serena Clacket and shudders
He spots a VERY LOVELY WOMAN hidden amongst the guests
scribbles in a small note pad occasionally glancing
Hiding his dance card he saunters over

LEOPOLD

Good evening I do not believe I

have had the pleasure
The young woman stares vacantly at Leopold until she

he is addressing her She puts her pad away

CARLSON
Julia Carlson

Leopold takes her hand and kisses it gently

CARLSON
Im sorry Will you excuse me

LEOPOLD
(slightly tipsy)

You are not from the area are you

CARLSON
(smiles and shakes
her head No)
Are you

LEOPOLD
This is my estate

CARLSON
Really
(looking around the
room)

Well its not home but its much

Leopold regards her curiously The orchestra starts up

There
is a hubbub amongst the guests
LEOPOLD
Shocking The TA-RA-RA-BOOM-DE-AY
CARLSON
The Oh thats from Paris isnt
it
LEOPOLD
It is a scandal nonetheless
Leopold spots Uncle Otto observing him from across the
room
LEOPOLD
Miss Carlson do me the honor
CARLSON
Im afraid Im not much of a dancer
LEOPOLD
(smiling seductively)
Truly I would be in your debt Any
admonition would be erased simply by
presenting a partner as lovely as
yourself
CARLSON
No no Really I
Leopold stiffly holds out his arm A beat Carlson
stuck

takes it WITH HESITATION and is escorted to the dance
floor
They dance ALL but Leopold and Carlson gaily sing TA-

RA-RA-
BOOM-DE-AY Leopold flushed looks quite smitten
Carlson
shy at first eventually smiles brightly
LEOPOLD
I suppose we really ought to sing
along
CARLSON
(embarrassed)
Oh golly
They half sing half speak the TA-RA-RA-BOOM-DE-AY
their
emphasis on BOOM Laughing giddily their dancing
becomes

freer picking up speed The room SPINS Finally

CARLSON
(breathless)
Thank you for the dance It was
lovely I hope it wasnt too awful
for you

LEOPOLD
Not at all It was most enlightening

There is a slight pause The Grandfather CLOCK strikes
midnight

CARLSON
I really must be going

LEOPOLD
I wont hear of it

CARLSON
(moving away from him)
No Im quite late as it is

LEOPOLD
I shall see you to the door

resolutely)

time

Goodbye

Leopold takes a glass of champagne from a passing
watches Carlson pass through the crowd and out the

door He surveys the room After a moment he follows

EXT GARDEN - NIGHT

Leopold makes his way through the manicured garden in
dark He hears an EERIE METALLIC SOUND He slows down
back the thicket The silhouette of a woman is

is once again writing in her notebook

LEOPOLD
Miss Carlson

Carlson spins around quickly panicked Leopold STOPS
Partially hidden in the brush a sleek oddly shaped
MECHANICAL device Its door open lit from within

a weird glow

LEOPOLD
Good God

CARLSON
What are you You frightened me

Leopold moves toward the contraption and is about to
it

LEOPOLD
What sort of mechanism is this

Carlson shakes her head unsure of how to proceed

LEOPOLD
Answer me

CARLSON
Its perfectly all right Its

Leopold carefully examines the apparatus stepping

slowly Step out of the machine
Step out and Ill explain whatever

LEOPOLD
What is this Who are you

His hand comes to rest on a glowing red lever

CARLSON
Oh God

She YANKS on his arm Instinctively he pulls away
accidentally thrusting the lever into action Carlson

from the machine
CARLSON

The machine LIGHTS UP

They approach Leopold Dr Kau finds Carlsons note pad

INT LAB - KATES OFFICE - DAY

KATHERINE COLES a radiant workaholic types
frenetically

into the computer while talking on the phone trying
hard

not to sound upset

KATE
Whos upset People fall in love
they have to climb back out
(she laughs but she
is not smiling)
So what Well just be friends now
Right

She stops typing and listens for a while She runs her
hand

through her hair

KATE

I see Well I appreciate your honesty

(using her middle

finger she pushes up

her glasses)
No Ill just think of this as
surviving another dating accident
Take care or good luck or whatever
Im supposed to

The line goes dead

KATE
-Say Goodbye

Dr Plodder bursts in Kate sees his distress and
instantly

becomes very centered

DR PLODDER
Shes back
KATE
(rising)
Thats impossible She wasnt supposed
to return until

DR PLODDER
Kate Its Carlson Something went
wrong

He hands her Carlsons note pad Slowly she sits down

KATE

KATE

(all business reading

from a printout)
of Albany He was the IS the
son of Emery and Eliza He was of no
actual importance until he vanished
at the turn of the century without a
trace It was a sensation In the
30s they even made a movie about
him The Tenuous Duke with Ronald
Coleman

DR DRAKE
(absently)
I love Ronald Coleman

KATE
Despite much speculation and a nation
wide investigation a body was never
found He was never heard from again

DR KAU
Until now

There is a stunned silence They stare at Leopold in
awe

DR DRAKE
Weve altered the course of history

DR KAU
We never should have started this

KATE
Calm down
DR PLODDER
What are we going to do We cant
keep him here Imagine if anyone
found out

KATE
Think Just think Rationally Now
no one would believe such a stupid
mistake could be made because no one
would believe any of this is possible
So We fix this We keep this to
ourselves and we fix it Fast

They all nod in agreement

KATE
Dr Kau research all our data 1st
priority Locate Carlson Drake
determine the reciprocal correlations
connected to the 19th century Work
24 hours a day if necessary In the
meantime one of us will have to
take charge of him

She forces back panic Only the tremor in her voice
gives
her away

KATE
This is a major scientific
opportunity It doesnt get any better
than this Imagine Researching the
behavior the physical and emotional
characteristics of a century ago
Utilizing technology available to us
today Hes a gold mine

DR PLODDER
Hes a man Kate Not a guinea pig

KATE
And while hes here hes ours Any
volunteers

No one moves
DR DRAKE
Well draw names Whoever is is picked

will be responsible Agreed

They nod reluctantly Drake writes out names and throws
them
Finally

beat

surround

Finally

in a cup The silence becomes deafening Finally

DR KAU
Ill do it

All the scientists face her

DR PLODDER
Youll look after him

DR KAU
No I meant Ill pick the name

She reaches in They wait with mounting suspense

SHE TURNS TO KATE The scientists follow her gaze

KATE
Fine

Leopold stirs He blinks at the group

LEOPOLD
Where What has happened

A

The doctors caught off guard SMILE BENIGNLY They

Leopold as a group not knowing where to begin

KATE
Your Grace Um Hello Weee
aaare a smaaall part of a laaarge
research team A project funded by
the government of the United States

LEOPOLD
(regarding their
appearance with
distaste)
Oh Americans I see

KATE
Yes um For the past six anda
half years weve been conducting
scientific experiments on density
and flexibility in the dimensions of
time and space

DR DRAKE
Yes uh Quite by accident we came
upon a formula utilizing Tachyons
particles traveling faster than the
speed of light which allowed us
to fold time so to speak

DR PLODDER
Yes Bend it between the cracks of
the dimensions

DR KAU
Yes

They all laugh nervously Leopold does not

DR DRAKE
Now while that wasnt the original
purpose of our experiment we opted
to pursue it well privately on
our own

DR KAU
Borrowing funds already provided

KATE
We journeyed to your time because it
was the quickest path to follow We
debated long and hard whether we
should use this knowledge at all
Believe me it was never our intent
to disturb the past

DR DRAKE
Merely to discover if the expedition
were possible As your presence here
confirms we are very disturbed

Leopold nods at them as if they are insane

DR PLODDER
The problem facing us is not only
HOW to get you back but WHEN you
see

KATE
We certainly dont want to
miscalculate Send you to a different
era entirely

Leopold starts to speak

DR PLODDER
Rest assured no harm will come to
you Youll be well looked after by
Dr Coles

LEOPOLD
Dr Coles I do not follow What
do you mean get me back home
Where am I

Awkward pause Leopold looks carefully around the room

for
the first time modern mechanical equipment data
shifting
and changing giant cooling devices bright neon
lighting
The doctors are silent
LEOPOLD
Answer me
(slowly)
Would you have me believe I am
being detained at present in the

ninety-five
LEOPOLD

Leopold leaps up The doctors follow him around the
room
LEOPOLD
Youre insane All of you This is

impossible

DR PLODDER
Leopold calm down

LEOPOLD
A voyage through time What do you
take me for Did you bring me here
by force

DR DRAKE
Were scientist not seditionists

Leopold moves quickly fearfully through the darkly lit
hallway the doctors close behind

DR PLODDER
Just listen to what we have to say

It is too late Leopold throws open the door and runs
upstairs

LEOPOLD

INT CAR - DAY

Kate and Dr Kau talk quietly Leopold tightly holding
his seat and the back door gazes out the window in
disbelief

KATE
Squab

KATE
I remember reading they ate a lot of

DR KAU
Squab Do you have a squab
KATE
(quietly On the verge
of panic)

I dont know
DR KAU
Pull yourself together
(turning to Leopold)
Are you all right back there
Leopold trembling gapes at the sights every day
magnified Perspiration runs down the side of his face
watches him in her rear view mirror
KATE
Youre going to be fine you know
Theres nothing to worry about I
have everything under control
Dr Kau stares at Kate in concerned silence
KATE
(quietly to Dr Kau)
Well never get away with this
INT BEDROOM - THE NEXT MORNING
Leopold awakens alone in his room He sits up with a
His stomach sinks as he realizes THIS IS NO DREAM He
rises to his full stature moving to the window he

on the modern day city shaking his head in awe He

his way to the bedroom door and tentatively touches the

There is a KNOCK on the door

Leopold JUMPS back and runs to the bed The picture of
dignity
KATE
How are you feeling
(no response)
thought you might like some tea

LEOPOLD
insist on being returned home
immediately

KATE
understand Were doing our best

LEOPOLD
wish to speak with your employer
Dr Coles
KATE

Youre speaking to him

LEOPOLD
You are not suggesting that you are
Dr Coles

She smiles

LEOPOLD
Miss uh

KATE
Dr Coles If you like you could
call me Miss Dr Coles or if thats
too much how about just plain Kate

LEOPOLD
(coldly)
A WOMAN of science

KATE
Hard to believe

LEOPOLD
But a womans brain cannot obtain
enough knowledge to posses a truly
scientific mind

KATE
(jotting this down)
Interesting Nevertheless weve
come a long way baby

LEOPOLD
(confused)
Are you attempting to be humorous

KATE
Im attempting to be informative
its just coming out humorous

Leopold regards her dubiously

KATE

(clinically)
Look modern social science clearly
states that a womans place in society
marks the level of that civilization
A science career for a woman is now
almost as acceptable as being a
a waitress Cream and sugar

LEOPOLD
Young lady I Surely it is not
expected that I remain here with you
indefinitely Unchaperoned

KATE
(pen poised)
Does that make you nervous

LEOPOLD
Certainly not

KATE
(writing)
Then what are you getting so red
about Its a very large apartment
with locks on all the doors

LEOPOLD
The idea My dear Miss Coles

KATE
Dr Coles
LEOPOLD
Honey
KATE
(she puts the pad
down)

Lets get one thing straight right
now My name is Kate or Katherine or
if you insist Dr Coles

(she rises)
Take a good long look Leopold I am
a 20th century American woman with a
Doctorate and a commission and
independence I am not your young
lady or your pretty Miss or your
honey Is that clear

Leopold watches her with great interest Finally

LEOPOLD
Honey For the tea

KATE
-Ill get it for you

Kate grabs the teacup grandly and leaves the room
INT KITCHEN - MORNING

Kate rummages through every drawer shelf and cupboard
searching for the honey Finally she spots the

honeybear

and squeezes honey A TAD TO VIOLENTLY into the tea She
tries

posing confidently then checks her reflection in the

toaster

INT BEDROOM - MORNING

Kate returns confidently with the tea and a plastic
smile

LEOPOLD
Thank you Has it been decided

what it is I am to do while I am
being held here

KATE
Oh just some laundry the cooking
a little light housework

Leopold doesnt react

KATE

(clearing her throat)
I took the liberty of preparing a
simple schedule to efficiently utilize
your time while incorporating you
into my routine

(she hands him a

schedule)
As you can see my day begins with
uncomfortable

She moves

She rings

meditation and yoga from 630 to

smiles at him)
Next day we begin again Simple

LEOPOLD

great dignity)
At what time shall I WEE and POOH

Kate is forced into a stunned silence

CHARLIES VOICE

INT LIVING ROOM - DAY

Leopold PEEKS around the entrance to the living room
Confident its unoccupied he majestically walks

to date gadgetry Charlies modern art work bright
fashionable furniture Leopold recoils His eyes come

He looks around the room then brazenly presses the

incessantly

Instantly REGIS and KATHY LEE loudly berate each other
an excited crowd

Leopold jumps back several feet hands flailing in

him as if shooing away a bee He quickly yet

slams the power OFF

LEOPOLD
Horrible

He quickly scurries out the hallway

He stops abruptly He remains very still Composing
he turns and deliberately faces the room After a
purposefully steps back inside

He makes a large ARC around the television set is

by one of Charlies sculptures and makes an ARC around

He finds himself in front of a light switch and

examines it As he does track lighting ILLUMINATES the

He looks at the lights then back at the switch He

LEOPOLD
Is all food here this textured

CHARLIE
Mines good

LEOPOLD
Please understand I am used to a
different sort of preparation Where
I come from a proper meal is the
result of reflection and study A
recipe is merely a theme which an
intelligent cook can plan each time
with variation

Charlie gives Kate a look

LEOPOLD
Several courses are served Menus
are often prepared days in advance
timed to perfection It is said
without the culinary art the
crudeness of reality would make life
unbearable

CHARLIE
In Canada

LEOPOLD
(after a beat Firmly)
In Canada

CHARLIE

INT SUBWAY - NIGHT

then

The subway car is inhabited solely by Leopold Charlie

the oldest Ukrainian woman in New York City Despite
fact that the train is empty they are all seated on
the
same bench

Charlie stares straight ahead refusing to even look at
Leopold The Ukrainian woman hangs on every word

CHARLIE
Just drop it Leopold

LEOPOLD
But Charles it is so ridiculous I
am not interested in her

CHARLIE
Hah

LEOPOLD

In any case the problem is not with
me but with you

(quietly)
You have no idea what it takes to go
about courting a woman From what
Ive witnessed tonight it is
symptomatic of your entire generation

CHARLIE
(almost speechless)
You are some piece of work Leopold

LEOPOLD
Now I do not wish to get personal

Charlie bursts into ironic laughter and looks at the
old
woman She rolls her eyes

LEOPOLD
But you have been of great assistance
to me and I feel this is one area
where I can be of some real help

CHARLIE
Im fascinated Go on

LEOPOLD
Now why was I successful with this
young lady and why did you so
miserably fail

CHARLIE
What makes you think she likes you
LEOPOLD
Well she gave me the number of her
telephone and I assumed it meant

CHARLIE
Go on

LEOPOLD
As I see it the girl hasnt an
inkling of your intentions And its
no wonder You Charles are a Merry
Andrew

CHARLIE
A what

LEOPOLD
A Merry Andrew

CHARLIE
I am not

LEOPOLD

Everything plays like a farce to
you The more wit the less courage
I believe the modern woman desires
passion protection sensitivity No
woman wants to be romanced by a
buffoon

(the old woman shakes

her head)
Banter and repartee are fine but you
must add to that a different sort of
playfulness

CHARLIE
You think I should pounce

LEOPOLD
Im saying you must treat her with
respect Any oaf can attempt a crude
pass A woman of Kates stature would
never respond to an artificial tactic

CHARLIE
Kate

LEOPOLD
What

CHARLIE
You said Kate

LEOPOLD
I did not

CHARLIE
Yes you did Didnt he say Kate

The old woman nods

LEOPOLD
We are discussing your problem

CHARLIE
Not anymore You like my sister

LEOPOLD
Charles

CHARLIE
She has trouble with men you know

LEOPOLD
Perhaps she has not met the right
one

CHARLIE

She has met the right one HUNDREDS
of times But she pulls back She
cuts herself off You turn around
and suddenly youre dating a Sphinx

LEOPOLD
One never can tell

CHARLIE
Does Kate know how you feel

LEOPOLD
No
CHARLIE
Have you made your intentions known
to her
LEOPOLD
No
CHARLIE

Whos the Merry Andrew now I think
youre all talk and no action What
are you waiting for
LEOPOLD
I do not know if there is a future
in it

CHARLIE
Well Leopold no one ever does

LEOPOLD

KATE
Um where was I So after my father
died I had to go to work

LEOPOLD
Have you had many jobs

KATE
Many I got fired from all of them
Im the most unskilled person I know
But they were just survival jobs
while I was still in school I always
knew I wanted to go into science
like my father And I did
LEOPOLD
Do you miss him

KATE
I think about him every day He was
courtly just like you

LEOPOLD
I think you are a remarkable woman
Katherine Coles

be surprised how remarkable Im not

No it is you who would be surprised

Deliberately cautiously Kate opens the door

each other for the first time

KATE

LEOPOLD
Good morning

They kiss shyly Kate notices the feast

KATE
Look what youve done

LEOPOLD
Its nothing

KATE
Nothing My own mother never made me
a breakfast like this

LEOPOLD
I will have to have a talk with her

KATE
Leopold

LEOPOLD
Kate

KATE

About last night

LEOPOLD
Please sit down

He pulls out a chair for her and kneels beside her

LEOPOLD
Kate I had never before been a
considerate man I had with
astonishing complacency squandered
my life waiting for some incentive
to force me into action You have
made me see how rare our time here
really is I am most beholden to you
Kate And always will be

KATE
I sense the word BUT entering into
this any minute now

Leopold takes her hands in his She looks at him

defensively

bracing for worst

Kate lets

LEOPOLD
Do me the honor Katherine of becoming
my wife

out a very girlish high pitched scream

LEOPOLD
Shall I take that as a yes

KATE
Leopold Did you just ask me to marry
you

LEOPOLD
I love you Kate

KATE
Thats entirely beside the point
Youre moving way too fast here
Shouldnt we date first I mean its
obvious the first one went well

LEOPOLD
Where I come from thats pretty much
the way it works

KATE
Leopold even though last night we
loved each other that doesnt mean
this morning were engaged It just
doesnt work that way now

LEOPOLD

(taking a ring off

his fingers and

placing it on hers)
I have loved you since I first set
eyes on you I cannot imagine my
life without you beside me I want
to marry you Kate and make an honest
woman of you

KATE
Oh Leopold sit down

They switch places Leopold sits and Kate kneels beside
him

KATE
Relationships these days are much
more complicated than that Women
today have certain freedoms that men
have been taking advantage of for
centuries You must have been aware
of that If you think about it
clearly it should be obvious to you
that marriage between us is out of
the question

LEOPOLD
Do you not love me Kate

KATE
(almost inaudible)
Dont ever think that

LEOPOLD
Then consider my proposal

KATE
Tll think it over but I can tell
you now the answer is

He kisses her Its impressive

KATE
(out of breath)
Possibly
LEOPOLD

(a knowing smile)
I need you beside me I will not
give up easily

Youre tampering with fate
preordinance and God himself

LEOPOLD
We do that every day doctor It is
called CHOICE

DR KAU
Dr Carlson is still over there You
cant simply abandon her We have to
get her back

KATE
Do you think Im not aware of that
Do you think a minute goes by that I
dont feel responsible for her But
SOMEONE ELSE CAN GO

DR KAU
Only one person can return The
capsule accommodates only one person
Leopold has to find her

LEOPOLD
Perhaps she does not wish to return
Perhaps shes found greater happiness
in her new life It happened to me

KATE
Maybe this is her destiny Maybe
shes of more important use back
there

DR KAU
Julia Carlson died in the Center
Factory fire of 1897 two years after
she arrived She was 37 years old

There is a stunned silence

In the foreground Leopold is stopped by a woman midway

moment

He

he

takes

count

the muddy slipper offering it to her She turns ina
flouncing down the stairs

Simultaneously in the background Kate desperately
for Leopold

Leopold studies the slipper as he makes his way up the
He slows down hesitates and STOPS Very slowly he

around He becomes very still TEARS well up in his

The ballroom clock strikes MIDNIGHT

Kate climbs an opposite staircase to get a better view
STOPS In her heart SHE KNOWS Slowly she turns

stands quietly at the bottom of the stairs gazing up
her He extends his arm showing her THE RING He

his hand

The crowd the room THE WORLD AROUND THEM DISAPPEAR
eyes lock As she descends the staircase THE YEARS
AWAY Kates short hair grows long cascading around
shoulders The fine lines around Leopolds face are
They see themselves through each others eyes at the
of youth when they fell in love

Leopold bends down places the slipper on Kates foot
rises looks down at his hands and then up at Kate His
are caked with mud She smiles helplessly Not caring
wraps his arms tightly around her

MUSIC begins to play a slow waltz He nods to her She
a deep breath Her head bobs in rhythm She begins to

THEY DANCE
An elderly couple watch Leopold with interest

LORD WHITEHEAD
Who is that dancing with Leopold

LADY WHITEHEAD
Ive never seen her before

Kate and Leopold dance past They are older As they

gaze

into each others eyes they twirl THE LOOK OF YOUTH
RETURNS

At the center of the floor they stop dancing THEY
KISS The

rest of the world dances around them

Over this background THE SCRAPBOOK PICTURES BLEED
ONTO

SCREEN

The old formal wedding photo becomes a photograph of
Kate

and Leopold the perfect bride and groom both
discreetly

point to their rings

Kate stands with Leopold as he establishes a
scholarship for
studies in physics

The old photograph of Leopold and Albert Einstein
changes to
include Kate waving and smiling broadly for the

camera

The professional photograph becomes a double portrait
It

shows the two in their 70s sitting regally in
matching

chairs They hold hands and smile serenely Staring
directly

into the camera they show off their rings

SLOWLY the scrapbook closes

Kate and Leopold dance the music swells as they become
lost

in the crowd The clock CHIMES Slowly we
OUT

THE END

FADE
