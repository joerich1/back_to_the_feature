NEVER LOOK AWAY

An original screenplay
by

Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck

INT DRESDEN ART MUSEUM - DAY

KURT a small 5-year-old boy with steel grey eyes gazes
at the distorted grimacing faces of soldiers from the
hands of Otto Dix the twisted colors and shapes of
Kirchner Heckel and Schmidt-Rottluff the bizarre world
of Paul Klee At Kurts side is his AUNT ELISABETH an 19
year-old blonde of seductive beauty They are part of a
group of maybe two dozen adults all ears to a self-
confidently eloquent EXHIBITION GUIDE

GUIDE
(nodding with regret)
Modern art Yes ladies and gentlemen
Before the National Socialists took
charge Germany too had its share of
modern art meaning something
different just about every year - as
follows from the word itself

Ironic chuckles from the audience

EXHIBITION GUIDE (CONTD)

But the Germany of National Socialism
once again demands a German art which
like the entirety of a nation’s creative
values must be and shall be eternal
Bearing no such eternal value for its
nation it can be of no higher value even
today

As they stroll past paintings of unconstrained
prostitutes yellow hydrocephalic heads smirking
captains of industry African-style sculptures

EXHIBITION GUIDE (CONTD)
The German woman is ridiculed and equaled
to prostitutes

The paintings appear to confirm this

EXHIBITION GUIDE (CONTD)
The soldier is portrayed either as a
murderer or as the victim of senseless
slaughter all this in an attempt to
destroy the German people’s deeply rooted
respect for a soldier’s bravery

Indeed the paintings could lay some claim to such a
message They continue on
EXHIBITION GUIDE

And madness mental illness is elevated
to a defining principle Can one truly
assume that the eye of certain
individuals makes them see things other
than they really are That there actually
are men who see in their compatriots
nothing but degenerate cretins That
these individuals perceive or as they
might put it “experience” fields as
blue skies as green clouds as sulfur-
yellow and the like

The intensity of the paintings Kurt sees could

suggest

this

EXHIBITION GUIDE

There are only two possibilities Either
these so-called artists really do see
and believe the things they are showing
us here - in which case all one would
have to determine is whether the root of
such a ghastly impediment was an accident
or a genetic defect Should the former be
the case our heart goes out to these sad
souls if it is the latter however the
case should be looked into by the Reich
Ministry of the Interior so that at
least we can avoid further proliferation
of such repulsive impairments Or on the
other hand these “artists” do not even
believe themselves that their perceptions
are real and nonetheless choose to pester
the nation with this humbug - such an
offense would fall clearly under the
domain of criminal justice

indeed

They have reached the next hall and stop in front of a
Kandinsky canvas colorful streaks arcs blotches with

blurred

colored edges

EXHIBITION GUIDE (CONTD)
What does this have to do with art How
can this possibly elevate our souls
Where is the craft in this For art comes
from craft

He turns to the youngest person there - Kurt

EXHIBITION GUIDE (CONTD)
(kindly)
I think you could do this too
Little Kurt gives a shy shrug

EXHIBITION GUIDE (CONTD)
Of course you could Have a go And when
youve finished ask your parents if
they’11 give you a Reichsmark for it

Laughter from his audience

EXHIBITION GUIDE (CONTD)
You know how much they paid Mr Wassily
Kandinsky for this 2000 Reichmarks More
than a German worker’s yearly wages What
does your Papa do

KURT
Right now he’s out of work

EXHIBITION GUIDE

(ignoring this)
2000 Reichsmarks out of the working
German people’s taxes

The group heads on Kurt and Elisabeth’s eyes stay on the
Kandinsky canvas

KURT
(to Elisabeth)
Maybe I dont want to be a painter after
all

AUNT ELISABETH
(whispers in his ear)
Dont tell anybody but I like it

2 EXT DRESDEN ART MUSEUM - ROAD OUTSIDE - DAY

In the background we see a poster on the building
TOURING EXHIBITION DEGENERATE ART FREE ENTRY

The street Kurt and Elisabeth are walking along is
decorated with pictures of Hitler wreathed with garlands
swastika flags and banners announcing DRESDEN GREETS THE
FUHRER

Two men wearing hats gaze at Elisabeth as she walks past
their eyes gleaming

KURT
2A

Did you see the way they looked at you
Aunt Elisabeth

She is well aware of the effect she has on men

AUNT ELISABETH
On Monday nobody here will have eyes for
me Theyll all be cheering the Fuhrer

KURT
I think youre better than Hitler

She smiles at a compliment she is unlikely to have heard
before They reach a bus stop just as the bus arrives
The destination board indicates the last stop
“GroBschénau” They board the vehicle

INT BUS —- DAY

The BUS DRIVER is an elderly man with kind eyes He
knows Elizabeth

BUS DRIVER
So you’re taking your nephew on an outing And
when are you taking me on an outing

Elisabeth smiles good-naturedly The driver hands little
Kurt a bonbon

INT MOVING BUS EXT STREETS IN DRESDEN - DAY

The large bus winds its way through the streets of
Dresden the capital of the state of Saxony Elisabeth
and Kurt are sitting right at the back in the near-empty
bus The boy gazes out of the buildings they pass his
expression melancholy

KURT
(pointing)
Over there thats where our apartment
was

AUNT ELISABETH
(nodding)
You miss your friends

Kurt doesnt reply

AUNT ELISABETH
(teasing)
I know who you miss That cute little girl with the

flaming red braids What was her name Johanna

right

KURT
(embarrassed)

No not just Johanna

He goes silent The mood changes He is very earnest almost

looks like

he is about to cry

AUNT ELISABETH

Who else do you miss Sometimes it helps to just
get it out

He chokes

AUNT ELISABETH (CONTD)
But its only 75 km from our house to
Dresden You can visit them as often as
you like There’s a bus every two hours
Was it so difficult to get here today

lisabeth looks out the window with yearning
AUNT ELISABETH (CONTD)

But youre right of course Dresden is
unbeatable in its beauty

HOT As the bus drives over the Augustus bridge in
g we see the baroque splendor of Dresden in perfect

sunlight Aunt Elisabeth was not exaggerating

TIME CUT By now the landscape outside the window of the

bus ha

s become more rural

Aunt Elisabeth lifts her nephew onto her lap The boy is

AUNT ELISABETH (CONTD)

Arent you even a little bit happy that

youve moved in with us

hrugs At this precise moment he might well be

AUNT ELISABETH (CONTD)
And you can climb the tree behind the
house again Do you remember last year
when we were looking for you everywhere
and just as we were about to call the
police you dropped an acorn on Uncle
Gunthers head Not many 5-year-olds can
climb like you

She tickles him a little He laughs

AUNT ELISABETH (CONTD)

(quietly)
You know I think your father is very
brave not joining the Party One

signature and he could have kept his job
as a teacher and the apartment

KURT
He says that if a man isnt prepared to
suffer for his beliefs there is either
something wrong with the man or the
beliefs He says it’s criminal the way
the Nazis

AUNT ELISABETH
(interrupts whispering)
I know But you dont talk to anybody
else like this do you

Kurt shakes his head

KURT
Mama says shell persuade him to join
anyway And then after the war that will
be his capitol

AUNT ELISABETH
(laughs)
His capital

She looks down tenderly at the boy She is holding him
like a little child But since he is no longer quite so
little he is lying in her arms almost like a lover Her
breasts are close to his face and his hands He gazes up
She notices this He realizes that she has noticed but
still doesnt back away

AUNT ELISABETH (CONTD)
Youd really like to touch them wouldnt

you

Kurt doesnt deny
AUNT ELISABETH (CONTD)
But you mustnt

Her voice is so gentle and soft that it hardly sounds
like a real rejection She kisses him quickly on the
lips half maternally

4 EXT GROBSCHONAU CENTRAL BUS STATION - DUSK

Elisabeth thanks the bus driver as they step out The
streets are empty the bus station not even boasting a
building We have the clear impression that we are out in
the provinces No other passengers are around The driver
moves the bus over to a parking area with half a dozen
other buses Elisabeth takes little Kurt by the hand and
walks in that direction herself Through the windshields
of the buses we see the drivers eating their lunch
sandwiches

KURT
What is it Aunt Elisabeth Did you
forget something

Elisabeth gives him a mysterious smile and stands in the
middle of the area surrounded by the buses Apparently
the drivers all know her they smile at the attractive
girl She folds her hands together in a pleading gesture
and the bus drivers nod to each other One of them leans
on the horn and then another and soon they are all
hooting their horns together The deep full sound
penetrates everything Elisabeth closes her eyes lays
her head back and raises her arms as if in prayer a sort
of ecstatic gesture as she relishes the deep
reverberations that penetrate her entire body An extreme
musical experience Little Kurt is completely bewildered
After a few moments the drivers stop hooting

Elisabeth emerges from her trance pulls herself
together blows kisses to the drivers and takes Kurt by
the hand leading him away

AUNT ELISABETH
(to Kurt)
To paint a picture which gives you that
feeling Thats what theyre trying to
do those degenerate artists

The drivers smile shaking their heads (clearly this is
not the first time) and then go back to their sandwiches
and newspapers
5 EXT STREET IN DRESDEN - DAY

Garlands of flowers hang from the streetlamps and house
fronts there are swastikas everywhere and the sidewalks
are packed with people At a bend in the road 100 girls
in the uniform of the BDM (the Hitler Youth organization
for girls) are standing to attention A young confident
SS man is walking through the rows of girls choosing the
healthiest blondest and prettiest of them

SS MAN
You come to the front You to the front

The girls comply We gather from the loud shouting and
screaming that Hitlers convoy is approaching Suddenly
the SS man sees Elisabeth who gazes straight back at him
with open intelligent eyes

SS MAN (CONTD)
You in the first row Come on Youll
hand him the flowers

He takes a bouquet of flowers from another girl and hands
them to Elisabeth She acts as though she is in some sort
of trance Suddenly the convoy comes round the corner
and there he is the Fuhrer ADOLF HITLER Familiar from
a thousand PORTRAITS PHOTOGRAPHS NEWSREELS STATUES
MEDALS COINS STAMPS AND PAINTINGS (INTERCUT in rapid
succession)

The SS man leads Elisabeth to the front of the crowd
Hitlers open car stops The Fiihrer gazes at her with his
icy blue eyes takes the flowers pulls her close kisses
her on the cheek hands her a swastika pennant and
continues to gaze into her eyes even when the convoy
starts moving again until he can no longer see her The
other girls excited and curious surround Elisabeth and
bombard her with questions

6 INT WALTERSDORF - MAY FAMILY HOUSE - AFTERNOON

Little Kurt uses his own key to enter the house Inside
the narrow hall there is a large dark wooden wardrobe
mounted antlers on the walls The room is filled with the
sound of PIANO MUSIC from the living room Bach’s
composition Sheep May Safely Graze For some reason
Kurt feels uneasy He follows the sound of the music
When he enters the living room he sees Elisabeth sitting
at the piano playing the music She is naked She
doesnt turn to face him He lowers his eyes
AUNT ELISABETH
(without turning round)
Dont look away

He looks up again

AUNT ELISABETH (CONTD)
Dont look away Kurt If you never look
away your gaze will become strong as
steel You will see the truth And
everything that is is true is
beautiful

She carries on playing lost in the melody He comes
closer gazing at the naked woman

AUNT ELISABETH (CONTD)
This piece is called Sheep May Safely
Graze But you mustnt let anybody
notice if youre a sheep Or you can
never graze safely Thats for sure

She suddenly stops playing Now she presses one key
repeatedly playing the same note again and again Kurt
is becoming increasingly disconcerted by her behavior

AUNT ELISABETH (CONTD)

You know this note makes everything
alright This note The whole power of
music of life itself of the universe
is contained in this note People look
for the Secret Code for the Theory of
Everything But here it is the A in the
octave above middle C on the Bliithner
piano in the Mays’ living room in
Waltersdorf Nothing can ever happen to
us because we have this note

She starts weeping about the note laughing about the
note

AUNT ELISABETH (CONTD)
And now that I have found it I can play
it everywhere

She gets up from the piano and gazes at Kurt

AUNT ELISABETH (CONTD)
On the table

She picks up a heavy crystal glass ashtray and hammers it
down on the glass top of the sofa table until the room is

filled with a menacing smashing sound Elisabeth seems
content

AUNT ELISABETH (CONTD)
Even on my head

She starts hitting herself over the head with the
ashtray again and again until blood starts seeping
through her hair down onto her face

KURT
Aunt Elisabeth you’re bleeding

At this moment Kurts mother WALTRAUD and his
grandmother MALVINE appear

GRANDMOTHER MALVINE
Elisabeth for Gods sake what are you
doing

Elisabeth beams at her

AUNT ELISABETH
Playing a concert for the Fuhrer

INT WALTERSDORF - DOCTOR’S OFFICE - CONSULTATION ROOM -
LATE AFTERNOON

Malvine seems years older Waltraud Kurts mother has
come along for the consultation The doctor DR
MICHAELIS is sitting behind his desk in a white coat
with his tie neatly fastened

GRANDMOTHER MALVINE
Youthful delusion - that makes it sound
almost harmless

We hear Elisabeth’s voice raised hysterically in the
waiting room outside

AUNT ELISABETH (0S)
(through the door)
Mild schizophrenia youthful delusion I
can hear everything Ha ha ha

DR MICHAELIS
Nothing that cannot be healed by a short
break I should say

WALTRAUD
A short break in

DR MICHAELIS
- an institution yes

The two women look at each other

GRANDMOTHER MALVINE
We would really like to try giving her
some rest at home first She worked
extremely hard for the school leaving
exam And then she went straight into the
secretarial course without a break
Perhaps its simply over-exertion

Elisabeth comes back into the room She strolls over to a
small table where there are several photographs of Dr
Michaelis with his family

AUNT ELISABETH
(calls over to them)
Is this your wife You hate her am I
right I can see it by the way you stand
next to her

She imitates his posture in the photograph with eerie
precision Dr Michaelis stares at her shocked Elisabeth
realizes this has offended him

AUNT ELISABETH (CONTD)
You can ignore that After all Im
crazy

DR MICHAELIS
(harshly)
Kindly wait outside until we have
finished talking I shall not ask again

Elisabeth strolls out of the room casually as if to
stress that she is doing so of her own free will

DR MICHAELIS (CONTD)

(lowering his voice)
Schizophrenia is a serious condition so
Im obliged to ask are there other cases
of mental illness in your family

GRANDMOTHER MALVINE
Heavens no

DR MICHAELIS
Depression

CLOSE-UP a Nazi party badge is visible on the lapel of
the doctors jacket under his white coat

WALTRAUD
(attempting to smile)
We’re all cheerful

The doctor studies them

DR MICHAELIS
We doctors are the guardians of the flow
of genetic biology I have to report this
case to the Health Department The
decision about committal might not be up
to you

GRANDMOTHER MALVINE
(resting a hand on his arm)
Dr Michaelis Franz I knew your parents
Even your grandparents Please Dont
report it

Dr Michaelis remains motionless for a moment Then he
pulls his arm back

DR MICHAELIS

Just because it is you Frau May But
tell me immediately if her condition
worsens

Malvine is afraid that even by thanking him she may
change the situation She gets to her feet

GRANDMOTHER MALVINE
Goodbye

DR MICHAELIS
Heil Hitler

GRANDMOTHER MALVINE
Yes of course Heil Hitler

WALTRAUD
Heil Hitler

The two women walk out Dr Michaelis is alone He crosses
to the picture of his wife He gazes at it and places it
face down on the table Then he reaches for the phone

8 EXT MAY FAMILY HOUSE - DAY

Little Kurt awakes in his room to beautiful sunshine
spilling in through the windows He hears sounds sits up

in his bed to look outside A white ambulance pulls up
Two orderlies dressed in white get out Kurt comes
running up in his pajamas and sees them drag Aunt
Elisabeth out of the house Her two brothers GUNTHER and
EHRENFRIED embrace her as if wanting to hold on to her
Waltraud is standing next to her husband JOHANN When
Kurts father sees the small boy he tries to send him
back into the house but Kurt ignores him Elisabeth is
fighting desperately biting and scratching the
orderlies until they give her an injection of
scopolamine to sedate her

KURTS PERSPECTIVE THE PICTURE BECOMES BLURRED AS IF TO
ALLEVIATE THE SHARP PAIN

Kurts mother holds her hand over the boys eyes But he
pushes the hand away determined to see everything She
covers his eyes again and again he pushes her hand away
automatically stepping to one side

Elisabeth has calmed down and is weeping in silence She
gazes at little Kurt out of the ambulance window calmer
now and waves to him He waves back She tries to say
something to him through the window

CLOSE-UP ELISABETH’S LIPS MOUTHING THE WORDS NEVER
LOOK AWAY

The ambulance drives off They are left standing there
paralyzed grandmother Malvine Kurts father Johann his
mother Waltraud and Waltraud’s two brothers Uncle
Gunther rests his hand briefly on Kurts head

GUNTHER
(always the optimist)
Shell be back soon

But somehow nobody believes this

9 INT BERLIN - FUHRER‘S CHANCELLERY - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
INSERT TITLE Berlin 1940

A high long room in functional gray Nazi bombastic-
classical style 20 men sit at a long conference table
all in SS uniforms all aged between 50 and 60 This is
no typical group of SS officers these men are more
intelligent more precise better-groomed and more
pampered than your usual SS thugs At the head of the
table is the psychiatrist DR BURGHARD KROLL handsome
malcontent slightly effeminate He has the quiet manner

of a man who is accustomed to people listening when he
speaks

DR KROLL

I’d like to begin by congratulating you
my dear colleagues since the
introduction of the relevant law the
weakest percentile of the German
population has been rendered infertile
400000 individuals A proud figure A
contribution towards positive breeding
that future generations will thank you
for It is now my hope that we shall one
day live in a world where the streets are
completely free of mongoloids the
mentally ill and other deformities

This vision seems to appeal to his listeners

DR KROLL (CONTD)

But it is time to shift into second gear
As a result of the British air raids we
have an increased need for auxiliary
hospital places We cannot permit a
situation where a wounded German soldier
is denied a place in a hospital because
it is being used to nurture and maintain
useless life

He pauses and looks round the room The response is
common consent His gaze rests for rather longer than
necessary on CARL SEEBAND a slim man of about 40 who
gazes back at him with piercing blue eyes Seeband is
sitting more erect than the others his suit fits better
than the others his hair is more neatly styled than the
others he exudes order and control more than anyone
else in the room Is there something in Kroll’s
expression indicating personal attraction

SEEBAND
(formal and pragmatic)
How can we help What can we do

DR KROLL
Thank you for that question Carl

He produces a sample medical file

DR KROLL (CONTD)
Gentleman from now on you are not just
doctors and SS officers You are judges
at the Genetic Health Court What does
this mean Well any patient you have

sterilized or will sterilize in the
future whose medical file you mark with
a blue minus sign

CLOSE-UP A PEN MAKES A BLUE - ON THE FORM

DR KROLL (CONTD)

- remains in the institution and will
be looked after However if we find a
red plus sign on the medical file we
understand that the life in question is a
worthless one and the patient will be
transferred to one of three special
institutions in the eastern part of the
Reich to be relieved of his meaningless
existence Your pen is your sword

INT DRESDEN GYNECOLOGICAL HOSPITAL - CORRIDORS - DAY

Aunt Elisabeth three years older and calmer is wearing
a white hospital gown She is led through the white
corridors by an attendant A NURSE holding a medical file
stands outside a large door with a sign that proclaims in
large brass letters that this is the office of Professor
Carl Seeband When the attendant appears with Aunt
Elisabeth the nurse presses a button next to the door

INT DRESDEN GYNECOLOGICAL HOSPITAL - SEEBAND’S OFFICE -
CONTINUOUS

Professor Seeband is sitting at his desk on the far side
of the large office He places one last sheet of paper on
the impeccably tidy desk into a file

He is wearing a brilliant white doctor’s coat over his
suit and we notice an SS badge on the lapel The tie is
perfectly knotted A small light bulb next to the
intercom turns on Seeband presses a button All his
movements are perfectly controlled and practiced almost
mechanical but not without a certain grace

The door opens The nurse enters and places the medical
file on the desk in front of Seeband

NURSE
(whispers)
Examination and preliminary interview
Elisabeth May 23 years old Psychiatric
patient for three years Diagnosis number

14 Sterilization scheduled for today
1545 hours

Seeband picks up the file and dismisses the nurse with a
gesture

NURSE (CONTD)

(to Elisabeth)
You may enter The form of address is
Herr Professor

The attendant waits outside Elisabeth takes a few
hesitant steps into the room The door is closed behind
her She is alone in the large room with the Professor
Seeband studies the file and without looking up points
to a chair on the other side of the desk

SEEBAND
You can sit down

She walks over and sits down A few seconds pass

AUNT ELISABETH
Good day

SEEBAND
Heil Hitler

AUNT ELISABETH
Why should I heal him Youre the doctor

She giggles a little at her joke Seeband looks up his
face lacking all expression

AUNT ELISABETH (CONTD)

(meekly like a child)
Heil Hitler Excuse me I always have
to say whatever comes to my mind Thats
my problem

SEEBAND
Is that your only problem

AUNT ELISABETH
You will have to answer that one

Seeband makes a note

Elisabeth points to a framed water-color on the wall a
landscape with a rainbow

AUNT ELISABETH
Is that by your daughter

Seeband clearly does not wish the conversation turned to
his family

SEEBAND
Why do you think you are here

AUNT ELISABETH
Because I sometimes dont think very
properly

Seeband notes down her reply

SEEBAND
Do you know what kind of hospital this
is

Elisabeth shakes her head

SEEBAND (CONTD)
A gynecological hospital

She doesnt seem particularly impressed Elisabeth
continues to gaze at the water-color

AUNT ELISABETH

A very nice girl your daughter I can
see from the picture Not what you would
really call artistically talented I
suppose you might even be pleased by
that But a lot of heart I have a nephew
the same age Unfortunately hes very
talented I sometimes take him to
exhibitions to encourage him

SEEBAND
Very well now please go and get on to
the examination chair in the next room
Take off your

Now we hear a loud shout on the other side of the door
MAN (OFF)
(through the door)

I insist on speaking to the professor

We also hear the voice of the nurse who is trying to
calm the man down Seeband gets to his feet

SEEBAND
Excuse me a moment

He crosses to the door and when he opens it a man aged
about 50 is gazing at him with such hatred that even
Seeband is taken aback

MAN
Well there he is

SEEBAND
Herr Lohse-Wachtler

Seeband leaves the room closing the door behind him
Elisabeth cant hear anything else

On the spur of the moment she reaches out for her file
where Seeband has been writing his notes A few phrases
leap out at her

CLOSE-UP Diagnosis 14 schizophrenic disorder To
render infertile Sterilization appointment 1545
hours

In shock Elisabeth closes the file and pushes it back
across the desk

Seeband comes back into the room As he closes the door
we see the man outside being led away by two attendants

When Seeband sits down at his desk he notices immediately
that the file is in a slightly different position He
looks Elisabeth in the eye severely

SEEBAND (CONTD)
t would have been better had you not
seen that

AUNT ELISABETH
am from a healthy background I know
m healthy

SEEBAND
(pointing to the file)
Three experts are of a different view

nq

She leaps up

AUNT ELISABETH
No No

SEEBAND

(severely)
Sit down again

He addresses her with such authority that she obeys He
presses the button next to the intercom Immediately the
attendant enters and approaches Elisabeth who is sitting
in her chair

SEEBAND
You will now go to the examination room
and then to the operating theater and
you will cooperate Otherwise we shall
have to strap you down and everything
will be more difficult and more painful

Elisabeth looks round desperately wringing her hands
She suddenly leaps up and runs past Seeband to the
furthest corner of the room as far away as possible
pressing her back against the wall

AUNT ELISABETH

(pleading)
Please Herr Seeband Herr
Professor Please Please

The attendant tries to grab hold of her but its
difficult to pull her out of the corner

AUNT ELISABETH (CONTD)
(increasingly hysterical)
Please For the Fuhrer I shall have
children healthy Aryan children
please please please Herr Professor I
will give them to the Fuhrer as we are
supposed to And my children will also
give their children to the Fuhrer For
the war You need soldiers dont you
Who else is going to fight Who else
is going to fight Im only sometimes

confused Not very often at all
Please Dont take my children away from
me

She has become very weak and now allows the attendant to
lift her to her feet and lead her towards the door

But after a few steps suddenly she pulls free and leaps
at Seeband grabbing his feet like a sinner in a biblical
painting

AUNT ELISABETH (CONTD)
(shrill in despair)
You are a father too arent you
Please for your daughter She paints

too She could be my sister I could
be your daughter Papa Papa

Seeband is horrified and revolted but doesnt want to
touch Elisabeth himself The attendant struggles trying
to pull her free

CLOSE-UP a tear falls onto Seeband’s highly polished
shoe splashing there

The attendant drags Elisabeth to the door She is still
gazing at Seeband stretching her arms out to him Tears
are flowing down her cheeks The door is closed behind
her For a moment we can still hear Elisabeth outside
then there is silence Seeband presses the button of his
intercom

SEEBAND
Andrea I will not perform the operation
on Fraulein May myself Assign Blockmann

ANDREA (V O)
(over the intercom)
But he is scheduled for the delivery room
today

SEEBAND
(impatiently)
Then change the schedule

He turns off the intercom He looks down at the damp tear
stain on his shoe takes out a handkerchief and wipes it
dry As he is about to put the handkerchief back in his
pocket he looks at it in disgust and drops it into the
garbage can Then he picks up Elisabeths file After
hesitating briefly he reaches for a pen and draws a red
cross in the appropriate box

EXT ARNSDORF SANATORIUM - DAY
INSERT TITLE 1941

The MayBarnert family step off a bus onto a dusty
village street They have all made an effort with their
appearance Ehrenfried and Giinther are in their army

GRANDMOTHER MALVINE

They approach the sanatorium Waltraud notices something
and turns to her husband

WALTRAUD

Johann

He turns to her with a guilty expression She gives him a
meaningful look He reaches into his pocket and hands her
something A Nazi party badge She pins it to his lapel
as if he were a little boy

JOHANN
(sadly resigned)
I know after the war it will be my
capital

WALTRAUD

Johann nods reluctantly They climb the broad steps to
the sanatorium

EHRENFRIED
(whispers to Johann)
If you really cant bring yourself to say

Nobody will notice

WALTRAUD

(to Kurt)
Dont say anything about your painting

She raises an admonishing index finger Kurt looks
ashamed

WALTRAUD (CONTD)
(to Gunther)
And keep quiet about enjoying Heine’s
books We dont have any hobbies and we
know nothing about art or culture

She says this so seriously that suddenly everybody starts

laughing including grandmother Malvina and Waltraud
herself

small town in Russia with a company of 40 men

OFFICER
Reconnaissance in groups of two
Rendezvous back here in 30 minutes

Gunther and Ehrenfried walk through the town the
civilian population watching them with fearful awed
expressions A little Russian boy holding a camera tugs
at Gunther’s sleeve and points to the camera indicating
that he wants to sell it

RUSSIAN BOY
One Reichsmark One Reichsmmark

Gunther laughs

GUNTHER
I cant drag a camera all the way to
Moscow But you take a photograph

The boy doesnt understand

GUNTHER (CONTD)
You - click click - send to Germany I
give you one Reichsmark You keep camera

Now the boy understands Giinther gives him an army postal
envelope complete with stamp and address which the boy
gazes at in amazement The boy indicates Ginther should
stand next to a wall It is the most desolate background
for a photograph one could imagine but Gunther complies

EHRENFRIED

Dear Mummy we would like to share with
you the magnificence of our lives here

He gestures to indicate his meaning smile Giinther has
to smile at this The boy focuses the picture - not
entirely successfully - and presses the shutter release
Gunther hands him a one Reichsmark coin and pats him on
the head which again surprises the boy

EHRENFRIED

What are the chances would you say that
he really will send the photograph back

Kurt now 13 years old and somewhat too tall for his
cot awakes from the sound of airplane engines ROARING
outside He sits up to watch them from his window then
decides to run outside

INT MAY FAMILY HOUSE - NIGHT

In the backyard Kurt watches American and British
warplanes race across the sky with a menacing THUNDER
They seem close enough to touch And there are more and
more of them

Suddenly something moves down from the sky Thin strips
of metallic foil - hundreds and thousands of them - rain
down from the sky like glittering snakes

Malvine in her dressing gown comes out and stands next
to the boy

GRANDMOTHER MALVINE
Metallic foil I read about that Its to
interfere with the radio and radar

Moments later the city some distance away begins to glow
with flames and we hear muffled EXPLOSIONS

INT MOVING BUS EXT STREETS IN DRESDEN - DAY

The bus driver we know from the opening sequence is
driving through an archway in Dresden Suddenly there is
the ROAR of aero-engines a WHISTLING sound and a CRASH
as a bomb HITS the roof of the building he is driving
through It COLLAPSES burying and killing the bus and
everybody inside it

garden who can only see the bombers overhead and the
distant flames but can imagine what is happening there
His mother has joined him We see the distant fires
reflected in their faces His mother places her hand over
the boys eyes but he pushes her hand down She does not
try again More and more bombers are approaching in the
skies overhead

KURT’S POV He BLURS THE IMAGE of the bombers

INT EASTERN FRONT —- WAREHOUSE IN WITEBSK - SIMULTANEOUS

Ehrenfried and Gunther frost on their now bearded faces
are lying close together among other German soldiers
huddled in field sleeping bags inside an icy cold
warehouse We see large signs in Cyrillic letters on the
walls Suddenly an ARTILLERY SHELL CRASHES through the
roof The German soldiers leap up Another SHELL HITS A
fragment of shrapnel strikes Ehrenfried in the throat
cuts open his carotid artery Gunther leaps over to him
and attempts to staunch the blood Ehrenfried tries to
say something but cant produce a single word He dies in
his brother’s arms Gunther enraged and desperate grabs
his gun and runs over to the door standing with his back
to the wall just next to it Hes ready to run outside
when a salvo of machine gun fire smashes through the thin
walls of the warehouse Pinpricks of light create a
graphic depiction of the holes made in the wall by the
bullets And suddenly we see blood appear at four places
on Gunthers uniform the bullets have also gone through
his body He slumps down the wall dead

INT GROSSCHWEIDNITZ CLINIC - CORRIDORS - SIMULTANEOUS

In Groandschweidnitz a group of 20 psychiatric patients is
led down a white tile spiral staircase Several patients
with Downs syndrome are among them One of them keeps on
kissing the walls while another clutches the hand of the
attendant with complete trust Among them Aunt Elisabeth
now very thin her eyes hollow from misery and
malnutrition looking like a mummified child She also
allows herself to be led without complaint but at the
same time she watches everything very closely They have
reached their destination and now the patients are led
into the shower room

INT GROSSCHWEIDNITZ CLINIC - SHOWER ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Inside this white-tiled room the patients obediently
spread out so each one is standing underneath a shower
head They look up puzzled because nothing happens when
they turn the taps It suddenly becomes apparent that
only the patients themselves are left in the room The
door is locked And then carbon monoxide emanates from
tiny holes in several pipes that run the length of the
room Some of the patients dont understand whats
happening Others begin to scream or weep

Elisabeth stands there quite calmly watching what is
happening around her A few of the patients with more
presence of mind run over to the door and hammer on it
trying to open it But it is sealed so tightly that it
doesnt move in the slightest

INT GROSSCHWEIDNITZ CLINIC - OUTSIDE SHOWER ROOM -
CONTINUOUS

The medical staff standing on the other side of the door
look grave and tense

Gradually it becomes quieter inside the shower room The
hammering on the door becomes weaker and finally stops
completely Then the face of the young woman with Downs
syndrome appears once again in the small window of the
door When she sees the attendant she gives him a
friendly smile kisses the glass and then suddenly adopts
an expression of pain Her face registers astonishment
followed by great sadness And finally she collapses
Then silence

INT GROSSCHWEIDNITZ CLINIC - 20 MINUTES LATER

The room is being washed out with a hose by two SS men
the bodies cleaned Then they are dragged outside
Elisabeth is lying there her eyes wide open as if even
in death she were still watching her murderers The SS
attendant is disconcerted by this

INT MAY FAMILY HOUSE - DAY - 8th MAY 1945
INSERT TITLE 8th May 1945

Kurt 13 years old no longer a child and not yet a man
is gazing with his steel-grey eyes through a crack in the
drawn curtains of the living room window

Waltraud and Malvine are sitting at the table listening
to the radio There are three other women with them

RADIO ANNOUNCER
People of Germany the Bolshevik hordes
are approaching They are already outside
Dresden They know no mercy They
plunder rape and murder You have seen
in newsreels the images of mutilated
German women and children in East
Prussia Lock your doors arm yourselves
And just as our heroic troops are doing
resist in every way possible

Suddenly Kurt sees two Russian soldiers approaching the
house He sees them alternately in and out of focus

KURT
(strangely calm)
They are here

WALTRAUD
No No
(whispering in panic)
Did you lock the door

The door is locked and every item of furniture that can
be moved has been pushed in front of it to keep the chair
in place that has been wedged under the doorhandle a
chest of drawers sideboard an armchair and right in
front of it even a wardrobe On these pieces they have
piled everything that is at all heavy

The soldiers walk up to the front door Everybody inside
becomes silent We see from inside that the doorhandle is
pushed down then up then down again

We hear the muffled guttural voices of the two Russian
soldiers as they walk around the house The curtains are
drawn Suddenly the barrel of a gun smashes through the
window the curtain is torn down with a jerk and Kurt
and the women find themselves looking a Russian sergeant
aged about 40 in the eye He appears angry dirty and
exhausted He points his gun at the people standing above
him inside the house

RUSSIAN SERGEANT
Stoitje Halt Stay there

GRANDMOTHER MALVINE
(to the other women calmly)
Don’t move We dont want to anger him

Showing considerable agility the sergeant leaps onto the
window ledge and into the room His uniform is torn and
ragged
RUSSIAN SERGEANT
(to Kurt indicating the door)
Atkroi dwerj

The meaning is clear but Kurt hesitates

GRANDMOTHER MALVINE
Do it Kurt

Kurt walks over to the wardrobe which has been placed
right in front of the chair that is holding the door and
tries to push it away but hes too small and weak The
sergeant laughs walks over and tips the wardrobe with a
powerful shove It falls and smashes on the ground The
door is now free The sergeant gestures to indicate that
Kurt should unlock it Kurt turns the key in the lock

RUSSIAN SERGEANT
Atkroi

Kurt opens the door A Russian soldier is standing
outside a private aged about 18 who is only slightly
taller than Kurt They exchange glances The sergeant
beckons him inside and gestures to indicate that Kurt
should leave

RUSSIAN SERGEANT (CONTD)
Woann (Get lost)

Kurt looks over at the women one last time Waltraud nods
to him He walks out of the door The sergeant locks it
behind him and then comes over to look at the women more
closely

RUSSIAN SERGEANT (CONTD)
(to the private in Russian subtitled)
Choose one

The young soldier hardly dares look at the women but
after glancing at them surreptitiously he finally raises
one hand a little and points at Waltraud The sergeant
points his gun at her

RUSSIAN SERGEANT (CONTD)
Frau Come
(to the other women his voice harsh)
Halt You stay You stay

The other women nod The sergeant leads Waltraud up the
stairs the young soldier following them

He takes her into the first bedroom he finds which
happens to be Elisabeth’s room

INT MAY FAMILY HOUSE - AUNT ELISABETH’S ROOM - DAY

The sergeant crosses to stand next to the bed still
pointing his gun at Waltraud

RUSSIAN SERGEANT
(to the private dryly in Russian)
Its a little tricky with clothes
Undress her

The young private starts to undress Waltraud He is not
rough with her He kisses her bare shoulder Clumsily
awkwardly - and then passionately The private is
standing with his back to the sergeant but Waltraud can
see the sergeant who now makes a rotating gesture with
his Tokarev pistol indicating that she should show a
little enthusiasm Waltraud therefore returns the
private’s embrace kissing him Satisfied by this
development the sergeant leans back against the wall

EXT MAY FAMILY HOUSE - TREE TOP - SIMULTANEOUS

Kurt has climbed a tree and is gazing straight into the
bedroom He cant look away He sees the picture
alternatingly in and out of focus His mother lying on
the bed with the private The sergeant watching with an
expression of interest

Dresden Town Hall in the Old Market to the cheers of the
onlooking Russians Beneath the sculpture of Bonitas with
her outstretched arms we see the completely ruined city

A squad of uniformed Soviet NKWD men (secret police)
climbs the battered staircase of the Gynecological
Hospital We see that the roof is missing and there is
rubble everywhere

CONTINUOUS

The men march along the corridor with harsh rapid steps
until they encounter two young doctors

NKWD OFFICER

Professor Seeband

The doctors are all too willing to point out their boss’s
office They watch the Soviet soldiers as they march on
until they reach the office Just as they are about to
knock at the door they notice that there is a large hole
in the the wall alongside it so they can in fact walk
straight into Seeband’s formerly tidy office

35 INT DRESDEN GYNECOLOGICAL HOSPITAL - SEEBAND’S OFFICE -

Seeband has been expecting this visit He is standing
upright behind his desk a white coat over his civilian
suit as if posing for an official photograph

He indicates a hole in the floor through which we can see
the room below The men walk around it

He surrenders to the Soviets holding out his hands he
is immediately handcuffed and led away

closely guarded by equally undernourished Soviet
soldiers

COMMANDANT’S OFFICE - DAY

A large but simple office An adjutant is using an axe to
chop up a valuable Rococo commode which has been brought
up in a wheelbarrow tossing the pieces of wood into a
heating oven

Seeband is sitting opposite the stocky CAMP COMMANDER
NKWD MAJOR ALEXANDER MIKHAILOVICH MURAVYOV just as
Elisabeth was sitting across from him not so many years

ago The Commandant is smoking a non-filter Gospodin
cigarette and studying Seeband’s file checking some
items with his interpreter and shaking his head in
genuine moral indignation

MURAVYOV
Herr Seeband

SEEBAND
Professor Seeband

MURAVYOV
(in Russian to the interpreter incredulously)
What did he say

INTERPRETER
(in Russian)
He wants you to call him Professor

Muravyov smiles at this impertinence gets to his feet
and sits on the desk so the seated Seeband has to look up
at him The cigarette smoke disturbs Seeband who is very
obviously a non-smoker but he tries not to indicate
this

MURAVYOV
Ladno (“Alright) Professor

He suddenly slaps Seeband very hard across the face

MURAVYOV (CONTD)
(in Russian)
Where is Burghard Kroll

The interpreter translates

SEEBAND
Who

The interpreter translates

MURAVYOV
(in Russian with subtitles)
Burghard Kroll Your boss in the
(he reads)
» Reich Medical Workgroup We know
about the meetings in Berlin

He holds a photograph in front of Seeband’s face

SEEBAND
I do not know what youre talking about
I do not know that gentleman

The interpreter translates

Muravyov hits Seeband across the face again this time
even harder

SEEBAND
still do not know him

MURAVYOV

(losing his temper)

The only reason we dont hang you
immediately is that we are going to
behave better that you swines We have
laws But since there are so many of you
swine it takes us a while to find all of
you and slaughter you Just like you
found and slaughtered anybody you didnt
like

The interpreter translates simultaneously without any
expression Seeband listens closely displaying no
emotion Muravyov seems to be wanting to argue with him
to defeat him by reason

MURAVYOV (CONTD)
If my child is born not completely
healthy then he deserves to die Is that
right

Seeband is always prepared to enter into a duel of
intellect

SEEBAND
The space and resources available to us
on this earth are not unlimited Who
should have access to them The healthy
or the sick

This argument enrages Muravyov almost as much as the fact
that he cant immediately think of any counter argument

MURAVYOV
Well Soon there will be one more space
available thats for sure

between two of the guards and repeats the words they are
saying quietly to himself Suddenly one of them hears
him

GUARD
What is this Are you repeating what
were saying

Seeband knows this could be dangerous

SEEBAND

I beg forgiveness

The guard looks into the cell and sees the improvised
razor which impresses him

her blood pressure There is a nurse next to him

underlines other words and then writes them out on a
scrap of paper Another German prisoner offers him a
hand-rolled cigarette from the top bunk Seeband refuses
with a gesture not bothering to look he is not
interested in comradeship or cigarettes Another LONG CRY
OF PAIN can be heard in the distance At the side of the
scrap of paper he makes a note in a table he has
constructed with columns headed Pre-contractions

Dilation and Contractions together with estimated
times

INTERPRETER
He is suspicious He asks why you want to
help

Seeband gazes straight at Muravyov

SEEBAND
I want to help because I can

The interpreter translates while Seeband turns’ to
Muravyovs wife Her face as white as a sheet bathed in
perspiration She is talking to herself panicking

MURAVYOV’S WIFE

A gypsy woman predicted I will never have
children How could I believe I am

one child And if she wants many more
after that

Amazed that Seeband has understood this so well
interpreter translates his words

During the contractions the uterus is too
hard for me to turn it I shall open the

indicates that Muravyov should pour the vodka over the
gloves he and the army doctor are wearing Muravyov does
so The nurse holds up a towel and the army doctor is
about to take it

lighten his mood change as an insight strikes him He
straightens up The insight remains

He opens his arms wide

LONG SHOT displaying great agility Kurt climbs down
from the tree Even his gait has changed slower more
deliberate and self-contained now

He strides towards the CAMERA Suddenly possessed by
exuberance he starts running towards the CAMERA and then
out of the shot

EXTREME LONG SHOT Kurt runs across the fields

CLOSE-UP as he runs and jumps his expression is one of
sheer bliss the kind of emotion seldom granted to
anybody in a lifetime

EXT MAY FAMILY HOUSE - DAY

When Kurt gets back to the house he is breathless serene
and inspired

His father is sitting at a plastic table by the door
trying to repair an electrical appliance The components
are spread out in front of him When he sees Kurt
approaching he gives him a weary affectionate wave

KURT
(euphorically)
Father You dont have to worry any
longer Now I understand

JOHANN
What What is it you understand

KURT

connected what everything means The
fact that everything is linked

to be afraid again am untouchable
JOHANN

(smiling mildly)
Thats nice

KURT
No Father you dont understand You
dont have to worry either I dont even
have to be an artist any more I can
choose any profession and will still find
the Truth

Johann picks up his dog and strokes it its hard to say
who looks more disheveled Johann or the dog In any
case he is as far removed from Kurts spiritual state as
could possibly be

JOHANN
Im happy for you really

Waltraud comes out of the house Kurt runs up to her
twirls her round for a few steps embraces her and runs
into the house She looks very worried

After a moment Kurt comes out again carrying a small
camera

KURT
I have to preserve this moment

He takes a picture of his father with the Pomeranian in
his arms another of his mother in her flower-patterned
apron and then runs back inside

JOHANN

I know who you are thinking about But
hes different

EXT DRESDEN STREETS - DAY

Kurt is now 19 years old a man though since he is so
slim and agile he still has a boyish air He is walking
through a typical ruined street in the inner city of
Dresden to his workplace carrying a worker’s satchel
All around him the rubble women are hard at work
clearing up the ruins from the war

INSERT TITLE 1951

INT DRESDEN - SIGN WORKSHOP - STAIRS - DAY

Kurt races up the stairs of the building slowing down at
the second flight because the stairs are being cleaned
its a hard job involving a cloth and a bucket of water
and now we see that one of the two people doing this work
is Kurts father Johann Kurt greets him briefly this
daily encounter may be a routine but it is still
uncomfortable for them both

INT DRESDEN - SIGN WORKSHOP - STUDIO - DAY

Kurt is working at a long table painting with incredible
dexterity the words of a large banner The German
Democratic Republic - Savior of Peace On an adjoining
table there is another banner Learning from the Soviet
Union means Learning Victory And Always Remember at
Work Your Aim is Achvieving the Five-Year Plan Each of
the letters is a meter high Kurt a burning cigarette
between his lips paints the letters freehand while the
others all use stencils

YOUNG PAINTER
Why do you do it that way So you can
feel better than the rest of us

KURT
Do what

YOUNG PAINTER
The work Like that
(indicating the banners)
Drawing freehand while we have to sweat
away with stencils Are you showing off
Why do you do it

Kurt gazes at his colleague his expression puzzled and
blank

KURT
I do it because I can

He bends over the banner again

INT DRESDEN - SIGN WORKSHOP - EVENING

The others have gone Figuring that he is now alone Kurt
puts away his brush with red paint picks up a stick of
charcoal and starts working on his own drawings which
have a Cubistexpressionist style

But the foreman is watching and now switches on the light
in the room Kurt quickly shoves the drawings out of
sight under the sign and picks up a paintbrush A small
glass of paint tips over and spills onto the letters
urt quickly blots it off and finishes one of the
letters The foreman comes over to him

FOREMAN
You can take the materials home with you
if you want as long as you bring them
back the next day

Kurt remains silent

FOREMAN (CONTD)
Next month there are applications for the
Academy of Art

Kurt suspects this may be a trap

KURT
(cautiously)
Im content with this work

The foreman lifts up one end of the banner and pulls out
the drawings Kurt realizes theres no point trying to
disown them

One of the sketches is a skull in the style of Picasso
Then three more skulls in Beckmann style An erotic
charcoal drawing that looks like something by Kokoschka
but next to it we see the contorted broken body of a
man A third sheet of paper looking like a blend of
Odilon Redon and Kubin shows a scary human face hardly
recognizable with the body of an animal

FOREMAN
(really annoyed)

Whats the idea Does this help the
working man Give your father more
strength when hes cleaning the stairs
You do want to help him dont you
Didnt you even arrange for him to get
the job

Kurt has no idea whether he is going to be dismissed now
punished in some other way or what

The foreman studies the drawings Hes still annoyed but
he looks at them with the kind of intensity that any
artist hopes to provoke His expression softens

FOREMAN (CONTD)
Youve been through a lot of shit
havent you

It is more of a statement than a question

FOREMAN (CONTD)
But do you really think it helps to
wallow in it Do you think that helps
create a world where your children will
have better lives than you Thats what
communism is all about

He looks at the drawings a moment longer

FOREMAN (CONTD)
Ill support your application

Before Kurt can respond
FOREMAN (CONTD)

The girls at the Academy are prettier
than here

few places it hasnt been possible to repair the bomb
damage and here the sun streams through in large beams
of light which are clearly visible in the cloud of
cigarette smoke that fills the room The lecture theater
is packed with students all happy to be here A gaunt
Professor HORST GRIMMA a painter about 60 years old
with a friendly open face is lecturing with great
commitment and warmth He picks up a new photograph
(showing a painting of a group of surveyors at work in
the countryside) and places it on the surface of an old
episcope He projects the image on the screen next to the
blackboard where two words have been written Socialist
Realism

PROFESSOR GRIMMA
Can you see that here somebody has
abandoned all vanity and devoted himself
entirely to the service of the cause The
service of the people

He allows the image to have its effect on them

PROFESSOR GRIMMA (CONTD)
Naturally we do not ask from you the
coarse naturalist aesthetic of
fascism which replaces art by kitsch in
the most bourgeois fashion

Now he shows reproductions of fascist works of art by
Arno Breker Josef Thorak and Willy Kriegel

PROFESSOR GRIMMA (CONTD)

And naturally we do not want mechanical
photographic-style copies in naturalist
mode What we require from you what we
need from you is a creative analytical
realist style that arises from the union
of reality itself and your artistic
relationship to it Work on your
attitude on your craft - and the right
art will come out of you of its own
accord

He changes the image again

PROFESSOR GRIMMA (CONTD)
Naturally we are well able to
differentiate between a Salvador Dali
this supporter of Hitler and Franco who
elevates schizophrenia and paranoia to a
higher level of existence

He depicts postcards from the West showing Dalis dream
pictures burning giraffes the skin of a face on stilts
William Tell’s gigantic phallus growing out of his
backside

PROFESSOR GRIMMA (CONTD)
- and a passionate anti-fascist like
Pablo Picasso who created powerfully

realistic pictures demonstrating a
genuine solidarity with the working
classes

He now shows some of Picassos earlier works the
barefoot girl the poor old man in the chair - but then
he adds the Blind Man’s Meal and the Beggar with Child
from Picassos Blue Period

PROFESSOR GRIMMA (CONTD)
although he very soon slipped into a
decadent obscene formalism Why Because
he wanted to be considered an innovator
not a traditionalist

Now he shows a series of Picasso pictures where color and
form dissolve breasts and tongues on the beach female
figures melting away

PROFESSOR GRIMMA (CONTD)
Innovation creative independence
artistic freedom - words that initially
sound extremely attractive to an artist
Me me me But a modern artist can
only achieve real freedom if he serves
the interests of the people The me me
me stance leads to misery

Professor Grimma looks up to see whether this point has
been accepted and understood

He is extremely serious about everything he says

PROFESSOR GRIMMA (CONTD)

At best it will lead to being subsidized
by decadent wealthy collectors
exploiters of the working man who delight
in maintaining that they have nothing in
common with the people not even the same
taste in art and for whom art can
therefore never be perverse and absurd
enough

The professor seems passionate about this

PROFESSOR GRIMMA (CONTD)

Now there are fashionable theories which

claim that the condition of

sickness is in a sense a higher state

mental
so

schizophrenics and paranoics can achieve

spiritual heights within their

madness

that are not accessible to ordinary

people

He shows some particularly sick paintings

nightmare

landscapes made flesh in the works of Max Ernst early
works by Francis Bacon with their own shrill power

PROFESSOR GRIMMA (CONTD)

But these theories did not develop by

chance They are characteristic
epoch of decadence of the
integration of civil culture

an
dis-
decay

mysticism and pornography Empty forms

artificial constructions squares

circles globes and dice All that

lines
just

in order to be considered an innovator
Yes its innovative its new But its

also wrong And vain And

Undemocratic Decadent Dont be

that Be different Be different

stupid
like

INT DRESDEN ACADEMY OF ART - STUDENTS’ STUDIO - DAY

Several students are working at their easels on pictures
of the scene that has been set up in front of them a
muscular working man is leaning on a heavy hammer

STUDENT

Would you please turn this way in profile

again

WORKER MODEL

(in a high voice and heavy Saxon accent)

Where Who said that

The students laugh the man’s voice is completely at odds
with the scene An entirely different student replies

STUDENT 2

WORKER MODEL

(getting upset)
Oh I almost think youre doing this
deliberately to make me cross

The students laugh even more and the worker storms off

Kurt has made more progress with his picture than the
others He has understood what is required and has
transformed the mans everyday shirt into a mint-grey
East German workers’ blouse inventing a factory
landscape in the background and giving the man a proud
masculine expression

The worker comes back with Professor Grimma having
complained Although the professor doesnt take him
entirely seriously either hes still annoyed that his
students jokes are interrupting the work

PROFESSOR GRIMMA
Is this a kindergarten or what

The professor walks around looking at the students’
efforts and becoming increasingly irritated

PROFESSOR GRIMMA (CONTD)
Yes Im beginning to think it is

The pictures really arent anything special awkward
first-year attempts But when he comes to Kurts easel he
stops Pleased he beckons the worker who comes over and
studies the picture of himself

WORKER MODEL
(in his falsetto)
Yes I think you have captured the
essential me

Now not even the professor can hold back a laugh

INT DRESDEN ACADEMY OF ART - STUDENTS’ STUDIO - NOON

The model has left and the last of the students are
going to lunch The only two left are Kurt and MAX the
student sitting next to him an athletic slim young man
with smooth black hair Max has produced a mediocre copy
of Kurts ideas with a very similar factory landscape
Now Max also gets up to leave

MAX
(to Kurt)
You coming

Kurt is so engrossed in his work that he doesnt reply

MAX
(annoyed impatient)
Can I at least have my cap back then

Kurt hands it to him he has painted Max’s Lenin-style
cap to cover the head of the worker in his picture thus
creating a perfect example of socialist realism

MAX (CONTD)
What more do you want Yes your
picture’s best

But Kurt is apparently still not content with it

MAX
Man shall not live from bread alone you
know

Kurt smiles but refuses to be distracted

MAX
but from ever pretty girl he might
meet in the canteen right

KURT
Ill be along soon

But Max seems to know Kurt wont bother coming so he
turns and walks off After a moment another student
sticks his head round the door and triumphantly holds up
two Faber Castell pencils calling to Kurt

STUDENT 4
A girl in the Fashion Department is
giving away Western pencils

56 INT DRESDEN ACADEMY OF ART - CORRIDORS AND STAIRS -
CONTINUOUS

This Kurt doesnt need to be told twice He runs out and
along the corridor and then with astounding agility
races up the outside edge of the staircase and reaches
the upper floor before the crowd

INT DRESDEN ACADEMY OF ART - FASHION DEPARTMENT -
CONTINUOUS

Sewing machines sewing tables rolls of material
dressmakers’ dummies wearing extravagant outfits It all
makes a powerful contrast to the neo-Baroque ruins that
house the Fashion Department

An excited little group has gathered around one of the
sewing tables Kurt joins them Max is slightly in front
of him He turns and grins at Kurt Kurt catches a
glimpse of the girl sitting regally at her sewing table
smoking a large box of pencils at her elbow She is
handing them out with a gentle smile Suddenly through
the crowd their eyes meet It is a trance-like moment

STUDENT
Elisabeth Me too please

The sound of this name causes Kurt to snap out of his
trance She turns to the student who called out Suddenly
Max leans over and whispers in Kurts ear

MAX
(determined)
Dont even bother trying Shes mine
Watch and learn how its done

Ignoring this Kurt picks up from a nearby table a sheet
of paper with a clothes pattern and starts folding it

Max has reached Elisabeth but suddenly finds himself
intimidated by the beautiful girl She picks up the last
of the pencils and looks at the labels
ELISABETH
(reading the labels)
F 2B or 4B
When Max doesnt reply she looks up

ELISABETH (CONTD)
Well

MAX
2B thanks But what Id like even more
than a pencil is

Elisabeth has already turned to the next student

ELISABETH
F or 4B

Max steps aside and sneaks a glance at Kurt hoping his
friend hasnt seen the way he was rejected But Kurt has
Max walks off

The small crowd disperses Only Kurt is left

KURT
Your name is Elisabeth

She nods smiling at his serious expression as he asks

ELISABETH
Do you want one Theres only 4B left

She holds out a shining green Faber Castell pencil
Suddenly he sticks out his tongue There is a razor blade
on it He takes it between his fingers and with
considerable dexterity cuts four notches in a kind of
open box that he has produced at great speed by folding
the clothes pattern It suddenly becomes apparent that he
has created a perfect origami ashtray for four
cigarettes

He takes the pencil and presents her with the ashtray in
exchange Then he pretends to swallow the razor blade
again When she laughs he puts it back with the other
razor blades on her table

KURT
A golden pheasant like you shouldnt use
a normal ashtray

ELISABETH
(indignant)
Golden pheasant I cant let you get away
with that
KURT

I completely agree A walk In the park
She looks bewildered

KURT (CONTD)
So I can correct my misapprehension

58 EXT DRESDEN - PARK - DAY
They are walking along side by side in silence Sometimes

he looks over at her Elisabeth is increasingly surprised
that he doesnt utter a word

They come past a large building in ruins with a banner
hanging on it proclaiming in large letters Learning
from the Soviet Union means Learning Victory We see
from a place where some paint was spilt onto it that it
is the very banner Kurt painted himself But he doesnt
say anything

ELISABETH
I thought you wanted to talk to me

KURT
I wanted to go for a walk with you

ELISABETH
Very well then Ill make conversation

He gestures to indicate that she should proceed
ELISABETH (CONTD)
Socialist realism is that really your
kind of art
He considers this for a moment
KURT
Probably about as much as Lotte
Ulbrichts is your kind of fashion

He is still gazing steadily at her

ELISABETH
Why do you keep looking at me like that

KURT
You remind me of someone

ELISABETH
Would you like to paint me

KURT
I dont know Would you like to make a

suit for me

She laughs However it isnt entirely clear whether he
was joking

ELISABETH
I have to get home

KURT
May I accompany you Just to the door

They walk through the ruins of Dresden until they come to
an area of large villas and stop in front of a
spectacular building from the late 19th century Wiener
Strasse 91

EXT SEEBAND’S VILLA - CONTINUOUS

There is a wooden sign at the door Gret Palucca Dance
School Through the large windows we see couples dancing
and we hear jaunty music

KURT
Youre taking dance lessons

ELISABETH
(laughs)
I live here The house belongs to us

Kurt looks up admiringly at the magnificent building

KURT
Well you havent really proven me wrong
about the golden pheasant thing

ELISABETH
We were just lucky the house wasnt even
hit once Before the war the whole street
looked like this

They both look at the ruins which the majority of the
buildings around them have been reduced to She looks at
him again He gazes back steadily It is a moment of
silence that neither of them finds uncomfortable

ELISABETH
You have such confidence Certainty
Almost as if you knew something

He gazes at her shaking his head modestly smiling
slightly

ELISABETH (CONTD)
Goodbye Kurt

KURT
Goodbye

He falters Thinking he has forgotten her name she
responds with an indignant laugh

ELISABETH

Elisabeth

KURT
Could I call you something else Maybe
you have a nickname

ELISABETH
(taken aback)
Everybody calls me Elisabeth really

KURT
Really always means precisely the
opposite is true
ELISABETH
(laughs)

Alright My father calls me Ellie
He likes the name

KURT
Goodbye Ellie

Ellie walks through the gate into the garden closes it
behind her and turns back He is standing there
motionless gazing at her

KURT (CONTD)
(to himself)
Elisabeth

INT MAY FAMILY HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

urt is sitting a the kitchen table working on a drawing
of Ellie in which she is smoking looking seductively
glamorous He is also smoking though with him it makes
him look more like a proletarian Next to him there is
also a new sketch of the Seeband Villa in Wiener Strasse
The house also seems to have impressed him

His desk is very tidy On an adjoining table we see a
small collection of pictures that Kurt has cut out of
newspapers including one of the British Lancaster
bombers and one of a group of nurses that looks very
similar to those in the sanatorium all those years ago
Alongside this are several works of literature bound in
beige with gold titles

Suddenly we hear a woman scream loudly Then again

Kurt leaps up and runs out following the sound of the
next scream and racing up the stairs to the attic He
pushes aside sheets and shirts that have been hung up
here to dry which are blocking his view Finally he
finds his mother standing in front of a laundry basket
and then he sees the body of his father hanging from a
beam by a rope Once again his eyes blur the image

INT DRESDEN ACADEMY OF ART - STUDENTS’ STUDIO - DAY

Kurt enters Everybody turns to look at him He walks
over to his chair and sits in front of his easel Max
squeezes his shoulder The professor approaches

PROFESSOR GRIMMA
You could have taken off a few days more
Kurt

Kurt shakes his head picks up his brush and starts
mixing the paint He looks over at the worker who is
again standing in front of them as a model Kurt starts
painting

MONTAGE

- Kurt works on the painting through lunch

- Kurt gazes at the models with his steel-grey eyes

- As well as the male worker there is also a woman
looking less than dignified as she picks her nose

- Kurt peers critically at his painting

- Kurt paints over the face of the woman

- Kurt working into the night on his painting

- Professor Grimma comes round looking at the
students’ efforts When he reaches Kurt he has to
fight back his emotions and pats his young student
on the shoulder appreciatively

- Close-up Kurt has given the proud working woman
visible in profile next to the male the face of
Ellie Her face is at precisely the angle that
Ellie’s face was when he first saw her and sketched
her Even when he was looking at her he had always
been thinking of the completion of his painting

END OF MONTAGE

ELLIE (0C)
A golden pheasant as a proletarian

Kurt turns round

Her expression indicates that she has heard what
happened She has in her hands a suit and shirt which she
holds up to him

ELLIE (CONTD)
You are now my seminar project

He smiles and starts to get undressed gazing steadily at
her as he unfastens his belt takes off his pants
unbuttons his shirt until he is wearing only
underpants His body is muscular youthful without much
hair But if he hoped to disconcert Ellie he hasnt
succeeded she gazes at him closely a sensation he
enjoys He puts on the shirt and suit It fits perfectly
and looks very good The material is coarse and natural
cut wide suddenly he looks like a important artist He
catches a glimpse of himself in a mirror

KURT
Ill never take it off

CUT TO
INT SEEBAND’S VILLA - ELLIE’S ROOM - NIGHT
The suit is on the floor next to Ellie’s clothes in her
large old-fashioned room on the third floor of the
villa They are lying on her bed naked kissing
tenderly gently He gazes at her
KURT
Its far too easy to love you Youre so
beautiful it’s almost unromantic

She laughs a little and hits him playfully with a pillow

KURT (CONTD)
Do you love me

She stops taken aback by the question
KURT (CONTD)
Do you love me Otherwise It doesnt
work with me

She doesnt understand

KURT (CONTD)
Otherwise it doesnt work

ELLIE
I love you

He becomes more passionate and aroused

KURT
(very openly)
Really
ELLIE
Yes

Now he can let himself go

ELLIE (CONTD)
I love you Really I love you

63 INT SEEBAND’S VILLA - ELLIE’S ROOM - NIGHT (SEVERAL
HOURS LATER)

They are lying in bed The two young bodies are only lit
by the moonlight and the flame of a candle Kurt strokes
Ellie’s back She seems calm relaxed as we have not
seen her before

ELLIE
Will you still be able to look me in the
eye tomorrow

KURT
What do you mean by that

ELLIE
When we see each other tomorrow
completely normal fully dressed in the
Academy with the teachers
(correcting herself with a laugh)
Professors With the other students in
the canteen Will you look at me in
exactly the same way

KURT
(tenderly serious meaningful)
No

She smiles

Suddenly the room is filled by the light from a car
headlight She freezes and listens We hear voices A
door is OPENED We hear the CRUNCH of gravel Ellie sits
up straight

ELLIE
My parents

KURT
I thought they lived in Chemnitz

She leaps over to the window peers out cautiously down
below we see the figures of three adults two women anda
man who have emerged from a car and are approaching the
front door

She looks round There is no key in the door and theres
no closet or any place where Kurt could hide

INTERCUT close-up of highly polished mens shoes coming
up the stairs

ELLIE
My father
(going pale)
My God what shall we do

Kurt gives her a look as if to say Well just have to
let this play out But her expression is one of such
despair that he now opens the window climbs onto the
ledge and jumps out - still completely naked - towards
the fir tree which is a good three meters away

After her initial shock Ellie looks round the room and
sees his suit she sweeps it up with a quick gesture
flings it out of the window leaps into bed pulls up the
sheet and pretends to be asleep

A second later the door opens to admit Carl Seeband A
little older but just as controlled and precise as ever
He sees Ellie lying there looks over at the open window
comes into the room and closes it He crosses to gaze
down at Ellie for a moment leans forward as if to kiss
her -— but merely blows out the candle Then he walks out
of the room

EXT SEEBAND’S VILLA - FIR TREEENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS

Kurt is climbing down the tree still about 6 meters from
the ground

WOMAN’S VOICE (OS)
(coolly)
Good night Frau Hellthaler

At the same time FRAU SEEBAND an elegant attractive
blonde in her mid-40s comes back out of the house to
pick up two bags she left by the front door She sees the

stray clothes lying on the ground frowns in surprise and
picks up the pants Then she looks up at the tree in
front of her branches trembling suspiciously

EXT SEEBAND’S VILLA - FIR TREE - CONTINUOUS

Kurt has reached the lowest branch and now jumps to the
ground rolling over and getting to his feet a manoeuver
which brings him face to face with Frau Seeband He is
stark naked while she is very dressed in a Dior-style
suit with a fur collar and hat She gazes at him in
surprise curious the suggestion of a wry smile on her
face

By now she has picked up all the clothes including his
socks and underpants and hands them to him without a
word He takes them also without speaking gazes at her
for a moment longer than strictly necessary and then runs
off Frau Seeband picks up the bags and goes back into
the house

INT SEEBAND’S VILLA - ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS

As Frau Seeband walks back into the house her husband is
coming down the stairs She gives no indication of what
has happened

FRAU SEEBAND
Elisabeth

SEEBAND
Sound asleep She left a candle burning
when is she finally going to grow up

FRAU SEEBAND
Yes young people

It sounds more wistful than disapproving

INT DRESDEN ACADEMY OF ART - CANTEEN - DAY

Kurt is having lunch with friends Suddenly Ellie
appears wearing tight pants and a soft light-blue
pullover which emphasizes her figure Kurt looks up at
her and blushes Ellie attempts to downplay her
uncertainty by appearing confident but the others assess
the situation correctly get to their feet and leave

making various excuses Ellie sits down determined not
to allow any awkwardness between her and Kurt to develop

ELLIE
Thanks for risking your life to preserve
my reputation But dont ever do anything
that reckless again

Kurt attempts a reckless smile but he has to express
what is worrying him

KURT
Did your parents

ELLIE
They didnt notice a thing Not a thing

Kurt is surprised to hear that her mother said nothing

ELLIE

They’ re moving back to Dresden My father
is getting his old job back as hospital
director But he has to rent out two of
the rooms in our house Otherwise hell
get into trouble with the Residence
Allocation Office He’s going to put up a
sign tomorrow

KURT
But the dance school is there

ELLIE
Thats only the first floor We have
seven bedrooms upstairs For me my

parents and Papa’s secretary

There is a scornful undertone as she says this last word
She gazes steadily into Kurts eyes

ELLIE (CONTD)
Would you perhaps like to be the first to
discover that sign tomorrow quite by
chance

There are large trees outside the big windows and the
powerful sunshine projects the shape of leaves
alternating with areas of bright light over her face and
body Its like a painting Kurt can do nothing but stare
at her

ELLIE (CONTD)

I mean they couldnt really hold it
against me if I fall in love with a
tenant they themselves have chosen

KURT
But your mother Dont you think she
might sense something

ELLIE
Oh Mama Shes such an innocent You
dont have to worry about her She wont
suspect a thing Really not a thing

From her intonation we gather there may be something that
her mother ought to suspect about Seeband

68 EXT SEEBAND’S VILLA - DAY
Seeband’s secretary FRAU HELLTHALER opens the door

FRAU HELLTHALER
Yes

URT
Ive come about the sign Is the room
still to rent

FRAU HELLTHALER
We put the sign up a quarter of an hour
ago

Is that a yes

She beckons him inside and indicates a chair where he
should sit

69 INT SEEBAND’S VILLA - ENTRANCE HALL - CONTINUOUS

FRAU HELLTHALER
(calls)
Frau Seeband Somebody has come about the
room

FRAU SEEBAND

(calls back)
That was quick

She comes down the stairs looking very elegant its
obvious where Ellie got her fashion sense Kurt gets to
his feet almost reluctantly hardly daring to meet her
eye She slows down briefly when she recognizes him but
then walks on

FRAU SEEBAND (CONTD)
That really was quick

She extends her hand and he shakes it is shyly as a
schoolboy

KURT
(murmurs awkwardly)

Kurt Barnert

She gazes at him with interest Frau Hellthaler is still
standing next to them

FRAU SEEBAND
What is your profession

KURT
Im a student

FRAU SEEBAND

Fashion
KURT
Painting
FRAU SEEBAND
Painting

Her intonation is almost dreamy and so gentle that he
finally looks up

We hear a door being opened upstairs and then a mans
footsteps walking toward the stairs

SEEBAND (0S)
(from above authoritatively)
Frau Hellthaler Come up here would you

FRAU SEEBAND
(calls up still gazing at Kurt)
Carl theres a tenant for one of the
rooms Do come down for a moment

Seeband comes down the stairs his every movement

precise wearing reading glasses and holding an open
file He gazes at Kurt Kurt looks straight back at him

Seeband’s POV Kurts face the lower lip twitching very
slightly

Kurts POV Seeband narrows his eyes in professional
scrutiny

When Seeband has reached the bottom of the stairs he
crosses to Kurt and stands directly facing him

SEEBAND
You have facialis

Kurt doesnt understand

SEEBAND (CONTD)
Facialisparese - partial facial paralysis
(pointing to his mouth with one finger)
The hanging corner of the mouth Did you
have an accident at some point or
borreliosis

Kurt tries hard to straighten the corner of his mouth
Frau Seeband takes the file from her husband and passes
it to Frau Hellthaler

FRAU SEEBAND
(to Frau Hellthaler)
Would you be so kind and take this up to
the office Then my husband can have a
few words with the tenant

Frau Hellthaler complies

FRAU SEEBAND (CONTD)
(to Kurt)
My husband is a doctor it is his
passion That means occasionally one gets
a free diagnosis

SEEBAND
You should have that examined Cortisone
can help Failing that - surgery

FRAU SEEBAND
(to her husband)
Kurt comes with the best recommendations
(Kurt looks astonished)
We have already agreed on the rent But
of course its your decision whether he
gets the room or not

Seeband gazes at Kurt he doesnt like the way the young
man looks straight at him

FRAU SEEBAND (CONTD)
Kurt wants to be a painter

KURT
I am a painter

SEEBAND
The facade of the house is starting to
peel Perhaps we could set that off
against the rent

KURT
Im not that kind of painter

SEEBAND
Then what kind are you

KURT
A painter of pictures

SEEBAND
Socialist realism

KURT
Is there any other kind

SEEBAND
I hope not

Frau Seeband gives her husband a gentle imploring look
this is the only way she can mollify him

SEEBAND (CONTD)
You can have the room anyway

KURT
Thank you Herr Seeband

SEEBAND
Professor Seeband

INT SEEBAND’S VILLA - ELLIE’S ROOM - NIGHT

Two burning candles and two glasses of wine next to the
bed Silent passionate sex Ellie is on top and when a
slight sound emerges from Kurt’s lips she places her hand
over his mouth He laughs She holds his mouth closed
more tightly and this becomes part of their love-play
They roll around on the bed laughing silently

INT SEEBAND’S VILLA - FRAU HELLTHALER’S ROOM -
SIMULTANEOUS

TOP VIEW we see the muscular back of a man during sexual
intercourse Also silent THE CAMERA MOVES BACKWARDS AND
TO ONE SIDE Now we recognize that it is Carl Seeband’s
back and underneath him is Frau Hellthaler As he
penetrates her she gazes at him with an expression that
blends devotion arousal and despair

INT SEEBAND’S VILLA - STAIRSCORRIDORS - NIGHT

Kurt creeps down the stairs clutching his shoes and
then along the corridor He hardly makes a sound Just as
he very cautiously pushes down the door handle of his
room the door of the room opposite opens - and Seeband
comes out Frau Hellthaler in the background naked
Everything is revealed to Kurt Seeband keeps himself
completely under control and retains the upper hand

SEEBAND
What are you doing up so late

KURT
I I’ve been out

Seeband sniffs briefly

SEEBAND
Alcohol Hardly conducive to good work
You should get to bed

Seeband closes the door and strides up the stairs without
looking back After a moment Kurt enters his room as
planned

INT SEEBAND’S VILLA - PARENTS’ BEDROOM - NIGHT

Frau Seeband is lying in the double bed eyes wide open
facing away from the door Her expression is one of
sadness but it also reveals her love for Seeband He
knows she is awake

SEEBAND

I dont like that Kurt We must make sure
Ellie doesnt get too friendly with him

FRAU SEEBAND

(motionless)
Why
SEEBAND
So she can marry well of course
(amiably)

Just as you married well

He lies down on the bed next to her placing one hand on
her side After a moments hesitation she places her hand
on his despite everything she is grateful for this small
indication of affection

INT SEEBAND’S VILLA - KURT’S ROOM - DAY

Bright sunshine penetrates at the window Kurt enters his
room and finds Seeband there gazing quite openly at his
pictures

KURT
Professor Seeband about yesterday of
course I would never

But Seeband doesnt want to hear this retaining the
upper hand as always

SEEBAND

(interrupts)
You have a new subject Me For the
directors’ gallery
(indicates a sketched portrait of Lenin)
That style more or less We start
tomorrow at four in the afternoon In my
office at the hospital

He strides out of the room

INT DRESDEN GYNECOLOGICAL HOSPITAL - SEEBAND’S OFFICE —-
four in the afternoon

Seeband’s secretary shows Kurt into his office Kurt is
carrying his easel and a primed canvas The radio is on

SECRETARY
The Professor will be here in a minute
You may take a seat

She walks out

Seeband’s office seven years after we last saw it The
desk is still in the same place Everything else has been
refurbished in the style of a 1950s executive office
There is a wood-paneled Mende radio on a corner table

Kurt walks round the room gazing at the chair and the
walls with such intensity it is almost as though he
senses something

Seeband enters

SEEBAND
I thought you could set up your easel
here

Seeband has arranged everything the perfect background
with a bay window and several medical diagrams

Kurt sets everything up as required Seeband asks Kurt to
turn up the radio a news bulletin

NEWS ANNOUNCER (VO)

(with conviction)
Since the people of the German Democratic
Republic unanimously desire peace and the
unification of Germany Prime Minister
Grotewohl has presented the government of
West Germany in Bonn with proposals for
free elections throughout the whole of
Germany These proposals were rejected by
the Western powers and the Adenauer
government in line with their war
policy

Seeband adopts a practiced pose his hands casually in
his jacket pockets He knows it makes him look
attractive wise understanding and relaxed The perfect
doctor hospital director and man And he maintains this
pose without moving in the slightest Kurt first sketches
his outline on the canvas in charcoal

NEWS ANNOUNCER (VO CONT’D)
As a further consequence of this war
policy the government in Bonn and the
western occupying powers have introduced
strict border and customs controls at the
demarcation line in order to emphasize
the separation of the Western German

region from the German Democratic
Republic and thus deepen the division of
Germany

By now we can see clearly that Kurt has accurately
captured on the canvas Seeband’s pose

NEWS ANNOUNCER (VO CONT’D)

The lack of any corresponding protection
at the borders of the German Democratic
Republic has been exploited by the
Western powers in order to infiltrate
increasing numbers of spies terrorists
and smugglers into our country Up to now
these individuals have been able to
return without any obstacle across the
demarcation line to West Germany after
performing their criminal activities

Kurt begins to apply paint to the canvas

NEWS ANNOUNCER (VO CONT’D)
Consequently we are obliged to take
measures in order to defend the peaceful
interests of the German Democratic
Republic The Ministry of State Security
has been given the task of implementing
these measures

After an hour Seeband glances at the clock gets to his
feet and crosses to look at the canvas Kurt is working
on He switches off the radio

SEEBAND
Thats pretty much what I had in mind
Very good We will continue tomorrow at
four oclock Three sessions should be

Ellie is lying in bed naked half under the sheets She
stretches seductively Kurt is sitting on her sofa
looking through the family photograph album

ELLIE
Why are you looking at those terrible
pictures I look awful in them Come over
here

But Kurt ignores her He is looking at a photograph of

Seeband at the beach leaning forward his arms around
his wife and Ellie who are in front of him

CLOSE-UP Seeband’s face in the photograph

ELLIE (VO CONTD)
(disappointed)
You aren’t looking at me at all

She has come over to him and is looking over

shoulder

KURT
Why does even the most idiotic amateur
snapshot have more reality than my
painting

ELLIE
Papa likes it

KURT
hats exactly the point Hardly anybody
ikes a photograph of himself Everybody
s supposed to like a painting The
hotograph must be truer

DHrEH

Kurt looks further through the album photographs

Seeband with the staff of the clinic

KURT

Why did your father go to work in
Chemnitz anyway He was hospital director
here before

Ellie seems reluctant to reply Kurt waits it out

ELLIE
He doesnt want us to talk about it

Kurt waits

ELLIE (CONTD)
(hesitantly)
During the war Papa treated the wives of
Goring and Goebbels

REACTION from Kurt

ELLIE (CONTD)
(quickly)
simply because hes the best
gynecologist They came 200 km from
Berlin as if nobody there was capable of
doing a smear test Just imagine
Anyway as a reward they made him an
honorary member of the SS He couldn’t

his

of

refuse But of course after the war it
was hard to explain to the Russians that
he didn’t have anything to do with the
Nazis otherwise They combed through all
the archives but couldn’t find anything
against him

Kurt looks at the picture again Maybe he really was
reading something into it which didn’t exist But he
still can’t respond to Ellie’s caresses

KURT
Today the Professor called me a Willi
Sitte type artist

ELLIE
But that’s good I mean he’s successful

KURT
(scornfully almost to himself)
Willi Sitte type think I have to get
out of here
ELLIE

Out of where

But she knows exactly what he means
ELLIE (CONTD)
Youre not serious But things are
going so well for us here I could
never leave Mama

Kurt gazes ahead thoughtfully

ELLIE (CONTD)
You were just saying that weren’t you

She takes his silence as agreement and kisses him Now he
returns the kiss

Academy of Art

PROFESSOR GRIMMA
(excitedly)

Your diploma work convinced the
committee They have selected you to
paint the mural for the new Museum of
Hygiene The theme is “The Joy of Life
Under Socialism”

(friendly making a confession)

Its a job I think some professors would
also have liked

KURT
A mural

PROFESSOR GRIMMA
Yes

KURT
Im not a muralist

PROFESSOR GRIMMA
Kurt we both know you can do it

KURT
Im sorry Thats not for me Thats pure
decoration

PROFESSOR GRIMMA

You would immediately have guaranteed
work Even money

KURT
Its not me

The professor walks off

INT SEEBAND’S VILLA - ELLIE’S ROOM - NIGHT

Kurt and Ellie are lying completely motionless Kurt on
top of her their arms outstretched on both sides Each
part of one body is touching the corresponding part of
the other They are still breathing heavily Kurt now
moves his hands slightly so that each last one of his
fingers is precisely on top of hers She kisses him

KURT
(whispers)
No dont move Please

She becomes motionless again her cheek against his

KURT (CONTD)
(whispers)

This way I can imagine that we are one

body
For several moments they breathe in unison
ELLIE
(whispers)
Im pregnant
At first Kurt doesnt react at all
KURT

(whispers)
Then you fully belong to me now

Silence

She looks at him curiously this isnt the reaction she

had been expecting

KURT (CONTD)
(smiling gravely)
With me I mean

She rolls over to one side kisses him and gazes into his

eyes

KURT (CONTD)
We have to tell them Ellie

ELLIE

Maybe we should start by telling them
that we are together To divide the shock

into little pieces

KURT

I think your mother might have already

guessed something

ELLIE

that his wife isn’t asleep

He is aware

SEEBAND
I think Ellie is pregnant

FRAU SEEBAND
What

SEEBAND

For several weeks now the temperature of
her hand has been slightly elevated but
no cold symptoms Yesterday she left the
room twice at dinner didnt touch her
porridge at breakfast and held onto the
chair when she got up The 3¢ month
Id say Maybe the 4th

FRAU SEEBAND
My God shes still a child herself

SEEBAND
The problem isnt her age but the man

FRAU SEEBAND
Who could it be

He gives her a look which says Spare me the games

SEEBAND
Leptosomic melancholic heavy smoker
facial paralysis a painter This is

not the genetic material I want for our
descendants We must prevent it

FRAU SEEBAND
But how

SEEBAND

(calmly)
After 30 years as a gynecologist I can
tell you I have rarely seen a
relationship survive an abortion

INT MUSEUM FUR HYGIENE - ENTRANCE HALL - DAY

Kurt is standing on high scaffolding painting the Joy
of Life mural He is basing the work on a number of
drawings including one of Ellie in a white bathing suit
He makes her belly slightly extended as if in pregnancy

SEEBAND
The psychotic thinks two and two make
five while the neurotic knows two and
two make four — but it worries him

Frau Seeband Ellie and Kurt laugh politely

ELLIE
There’s something we want to tell you

SEEBAND

(quickly)
About the Academy of Art Im always very
interested in that

ELLIE
No although there is news on that
front too You see Kurt has been given
the job of painting the mural in the
Museum for Hygiene

SEEBAND
(to Kurt)
Painting walls after all

KURT
Its a fresco with the theme Joy of
Life

ELLIE
And on that subject

Seeband has become very still Neither Kurt nor
says anything

SEEBAND
What is it my child Nothing unpleasant
I hope - my nerves you know

ELLIE
We are together

Seeband is telling a medical anecdote

Ellie

SEEBAND
You are working on the fresco as well

ELLIE
We are a couple We have been for some
time

SEEBAND

A couple of students

ELLIE
A couple in a loving relationship

Seeband acts as though this devastates him He looks over

to his wife for help although she looks back at him as

if to say Dont lay it on too thick

ELLIE
And theres something else

SEEBAND
(interrupts as if overcome)
Thats really big news
ELLIE

Yes and as well as that

SEEBAND
My God I have to take this in first My
God this is really out of the blue

He starts coughing and reaches for a glass of water It
is empty
ELLIE
(to a waiter)
Please bring the Professor some water
Quickly

Seeband takes a drink of water Then he looks at the two
youngsters with a mild smile

EXT DRESDEN STREETS - NIGHT

They are walking home Ellie and her mother in front
Seeband and Kurt slightly behind

They have something to talk about

SEEBAND

I am pleased you broke the news to us
And Im glad you did so at an early
stage You see there is something you
should know about Ellie

They walk along in silence for a couple of seconds

SEEBAND (CONTD)

We dont want to worry Ellie
unnecessarily so we have never really
talked to her about it but When she

was a little girl Ellie had a serious
infection in the pelvis which left scar
tissue in the fallopian tubes and
consequently caused considerable cilia
damage

KURT
Cilia

SEEBAND
Cilia are the tiny hairs in the mucus of
the fallopian tubes which transport the
fertilized egg to the uterus

Kurt doesnt understand a word of this

SEEBAND (CONTD)

At present we are looking for a way of
treating it with surgery But if she were
to become pregnant before then the
chances are extremely high that she would
experience extra-uterine gravidity - an
ectopic pregnancy with the cell growing
where the fallopian tube is And that
could well lead to extremely dangerous
internal bleeding

Kurt goes pale

SEEBAND (CONTD)
I must therefore warn you though not for
the same reasons that normally motivate
fathers of daughters to warn a young man
not to become intimate with her until we
have been able to alleviate this
condition A pregnancy at this point in
time could be life-threatening for Ellie

Seeband studies Kurt as the young man walks alongside him
in silence

SEEBAND

You do understand Life-threatening

Kurt looks up at the two women walking somewhat ahead of
them

Ellie senses his gaze looks round and surreptitiously
blows him a kiss Kurt smiles gratefully They walk on

KURT
(with a huge effort)
And if she were already pregnant

SEEBAND
(acting shocked)
Then I would have to examine her
immediately

Seeband stops in his tracks Kurt walks a few steps
further and then also stops turning back to Seeband who
is looking at him enquiringly Kurt nods gravely The
women have also realized that something has happened
they stop and look back at the men puzzled

83 INT SEEBAND’S VILLA - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE BATHROOM - NEXT
MORNING

SEEBAND (V O)
There is no reason to despair just yet
its quite possible that everything has
proceeded correctly during the nidation
and that I shall soon be a proud
grandfather

Kurt is pacing nervously up and down outside the bathroom
door now smoking quite openly in the house The door
opens and Seeband comes out in a doctors coat with
rubber gloves He is not yet facing Kurt who can see
through the open door that Ellie is lying with her upper
body on the bottom of the empty bathtub on her back her
thighs open and extended upwards knees bent her calves
resting on two stools Between them is an empty chair
with a doctors bag Frau Seeband is sitting next to her
stroking her daughters face tenderly Seeband closes the
door looking grave and walks towards his study Kurt
follows him

SEEBAND
I must act immediately The pregnancy is
considerably more advanced than I had
feared - its already the third month

INT SEEBAND’S VILLA - SEEBAND’S STUDY - CONTINUOUS

They have reached Seeband’s study He takes a sterile
cloth from a drawer and places on it two forceps and

various curettes - the instruments required for an
abortion
KURT
An abortion
SEEBAND

If I do not remove the fetus she will not
survive the pregnancy

KURT
Here

SEEBAND
We have a reputation to maintain

KURT
Is it really the only way Really

SEEBAND
Are you doubting my professional ability

Kurt doesnt reply which makes Seeband even colder

SEEBAND
Would I put myself through something like
this and my daughter if it were

not absolutely necessary

Seeband goes back into the bathroom Kurt remains in the
corridor He can hear quiet sobbing behind the door He
gazes at the door making the image blurred

INT SEEBAND’S VILLA - DINING ROOM - EVENING (MOS)

They are all in the dining room which is elegantly
paneled with white wood Ellie looks pale and thin
Kurts expression is one of silent rage Frau Seeband
looks guilty while Frau Hellthaler has an air of
suppressed desperation The only person talking and
eating heartily is the Professor

INT SEEBAND’S VILLA - ELLIE’S ROOM - NIGHT

Ellie is lying in bed without any pillows stretched out
like a corpse Kurt is sitting next to her with his back
against the wall Although her face looks almost relaxed
a stream of tears is continuosly flowing down her cheeks

ELLIE

He had an SS uniform made for himself
For hours he would practice in front of
the mirror trying out different poses
until he found the best ones

We see Kurt Ellie and also Frau Seeband who is standing
next to her husband The Minister of Health is making a
speech in Seeband’s honor

MINISTER OF HEALTH

the founders of our Socialist Republic —-
in short a fine example for all members
of his profession And today 11
December the anniversary of the
foundation of the German Democratic
Republic it is my honor to present him
with the Robert Koch Medal and the title
Distinguished Doctor of the People

With a flourish he places a bronze medal on a ribbon
around Seeband’s neck handing him a certificate a small
box and an envelope Applause

MINISTER OF HEALTH (CONTD)
(to Seeband)
Heres a small version for everyday use
And a certificate to frame
(smiling he whispers with reference to
the envelope)
Take care of this 8000 marks inside

Seeband steps up to the podium

SEEBAND
Thank you Minister for those kind
words of which I am not deserving

He catches the eye of his daughter who is gazing at him
without any love She is standing in the Directors’
Gallery where there are paintings of the directors over
the last decades The paintings are all very similar
Kurts work fits in perfectly - a fine work of
craftsmanship

SEEBAND (CONTD)
As a doctor and a member of society I
merely do my duty I am simply one wheel
in the huge machinery of international
socialism just as the painter of this
far too flattering portrait of me is only

a small wheel his style
indistinguishable from the other painters

Seeband the miniature of the Robert Koch medal on his
lapel is shown into the office of Alexander Mikhailovich
Muravyov Muravyov is several years older his shoulder
now adorned with a generals star When he sees Seeband
he sends the young adjutant (the man who gave Seeband the
message at the award ceremony) out of the room Only when
the adjutant has left does Muravyov embrace Seeband
kissing him on both cheeks The overpowering smell of
Russian cigarettes still disturbs Seeband

MURAVYOV
(genuinely moved)
Carl Carl
(something occurs to him)
Wait I must show you something

Muravyov has in the meantime leaned German though he
speaks with a strong Russian accent He crosses to his
desk and picks up a framed photograph of a very handsome
13-year-old boy which he shows to Seeband Seeband nods
appreciatively Tears come to Muravyovs eyes Then he
has to laugh and again he kisses Seeband on both cheeks
Suddenly he becomes serious

MURAVYOV (CONTD)
Carl I’m being transferred Back to
Russia I wont be able to protect you
any longer

Seeband is shocked though he makes an effort not to
reveal this

MURAVYOV (CONTD)

All the others have been caught On paper
we are still hunting for Burghard Kroll
and the medical coordinator of the
Dresden region for the euthanasia
program

(he glances meaningfully at Seeband)

I cant guarantee my successor wont re-
open the investigation and start
questioning doctors and nurses again

Seeband lowers his eyes uneasily

MURAVYOV (CONTD)
You have to leave the country as well
And never come back Apply for permission
to emigrate for you and your wife It
will be approved These days Wernher von
Braun is building space rockets for the
Americans As far as we can see nobody
in the West would be interested in your
SS past any more Nobody will suspect
the truth
(dryly)
Lets hope our side doesnt either

We sense that his loyalty to Seeband has taken its toll
on Muravyov

MURAVYOV (CONTD)
(openly trusting confidentially)
You can’t tell me anything about Kroll
Where he is Who else was at those
meetings
(almost pleading)
You would help me a great deal

SEEBAND
I never met the gentleman I dont know
anything about him

Muravyov nods He knows this is a lie He looks at
Seeband rather sadly and then reaches out his hand

MURAVYOV
We shall never meet again my friend I

hope I have repaid my debt to you

Seeband also reaches out to shake hands

clearly pleased with what Kurt is doing His old friend
Max is assisting him mixing the paint from red pigment
linseed oil and chalk Kurt hands Max the bowl of paint
and indicates he should fill in the outline with color

MAX
(happily)
Really

Max starts work Kurt watches as he applies the paint
with enthusiasm Kurt looks at the painting itself
muscular workers in white shirts with familiar hammers
and tools Capitalist lackeys in black suppressing them
Kurt shakes his head involuntarily at the sameness of it
all He watches his friend painting eagerly contentedly
Kurt is pensive

KURT
How much would you give for my Wartburg

MAX
Are you kidding me Do you know how long
a normal mortal has to wait to get a car
like that

KURT
I just dont like it any more 300 marks

Max gazes at him for long time silent and serious here
has a good idea what his friend is planning

MAX
Kurt in the West they even dont do
painting any more These days painting is
considered bourgeois

KURT
(skeptical)
I thought for them bourgeois was good

MAX
(now uncertain)
Oh what do I know

Kurt laughs

MAX
Of course we all want to get rid of you
Of course we do But youve got a life
here You have money Youre becoming
famous I mean I get girls to go to
bed with me because Im your assistant
You can handle the apparatchiks like

105 EXT DUSSELDORF ACADEMY OF ART - DAY

TITLE DUSSELDORF ACADEMY OF ART

ESTABLISHING the Academy A huge neo-Renaissance
building still displaying bomb damage A large banner in
appearance not unlike the ones Kurt used to paint
proclaims OPEN HOUSE DAY Visitors are pouring inside
Kurt looks nervous He stubs out his cigarette and walks
in

106 INT DUSSELDORF ACADEMY OF ART - ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS

Kurt enters the Academy A Porter is sitting behind the
desk near the door Kurt walks over to him and shakes the
astonished man by the hand

KURT
Good morning My name is Kurt Barnert I
phoned about a tour

The Porter gives Kurt a skeptical look (Kurt still has a
lot to learn about etiquette here in the West) and points
to the next door without saying a word

107 INT DUSSELDORF ACADEMY OF ART - ENTRANCE HALL -
CONTINUOUS

There is a table in the entrance hall with a sign saying
Tours for Applicants Wait Here Kurt waits patiently

watching the people who walk past him and enter the
Academy Most of them are curious locals in search of a
scandal judging by the straps of conversations Kurt

overhears ( punched him in the nose in the middle of
the lecture said Heil Hitler and claimed it
was just a form of provocation etc)

PREUSSER (OS)
(loud brisk)
Youre still under 26 I hope

Kurt turns round

HARRY PREUSSER is standing behind the table a stocky man
in his early 30s with very short black hair and a broad
confident face He is studying Kurt with piercing eyes
and takes his silence as a yes

PREUSSER (CONTD)

Good And what you want to do Sculpture
Action Installations

KURT
Painting actually
Preusser laughs
PREUSSER
(mocking Kurt’s mild Saxon accent)

“Pointing”

It is a long time since Kurt encountered anything like
this and hes more surprised than offended

PREUSSER (CONTD)
No offence Im from the east myself
Mecklenburg

He sets off on the tour Kurt following They walk
between a series of sculptures consisting of sheets of
metal made to revolve by electric motors

PREUSSER (CONTD)
Take a look around Nobody really does
painting anymore People want something
new - an idea

They walk on past naked models covered in chalk

KURT
An idea
PREUSSER
Yes But not something like that

something new or at least in new
packaging Like Yves Klein who says I
am claiming ultramarine for myself I am
even going to patent it It is now called
Yves Klein Blue And I shall only express
myself with this color I will paint the
naked breasts of a beautiful woman with
Yves Klein Blue and she will rub the
paint against the breasts of another
beautiful woman I shall paint sponges
with Yves Klein Blue and stick them to
canvases with Yves Klein Blue

They now come to another studio where a young female

student cuts slits in her monochromatic canvases in
grandiose gestures

PREUSSER (CONTD)

(whispers to Kurt)
Of course it’s no good if someone had
the idea first Lucio Fontana has been
slashing canvases for the last six years
Whats the point of just repeating it
But Katrin has lovely firm breasts so we
let her do what she likes

They walk on through various studios all linked like
pearls on a string One of the studios is particularly
crowded Here ADRIAN SCHIMMEL a good-looking young man
with fashionable black sunglasses smooth black hair and
sensuous lips is standing in front of a wall of
paintings which consist of repeated patterns in vibrant
colors

PREUSSER (CONTD)

Thats Adrian Schimmel The name says it
all

(Schimmel mold) (Preusser whispers)
His real name is Adrian Finck son of the
chairman of Mannesmann Prig But hes
got international connections - even in
Paris and New York they say And he can
talk thats for sure But is the
wallpaper idea enough

Finck is explaining his wallpaper pictures to an elderly
couple his manner extremely self-important

ELDERLY MAN
Yes I think its very pretty But isnt
it still what you might call
wallpaper

ADRIAN SCHIMMEL
Yes but you see it only looks that way
Thats exactly what we artists are
searching for that which is hidden
behind the decorative The emptiness
expressed by the holes I punched in it
The banality incorporated in the
material linoleum that I applied to it
The senseless stridency visible in the
neon colors in which I rolled my work
Thus it becomes obvious than in art even
the facade yes even wallpaper always
speaks the truth And that is precisely
what brought you here You have a deep
sense of the artistic otherwise you
would not have ended up here Piet
Mondrian presents you with utopia I

present you with the truth Your friends
see some pretty wallpaper You see the
level behind it

ELDERLY WOMAN
(impressed)
And is it possible to purchase
something like this

ADRIAN SCHIMMEL
It is Thats what so fantastic about
art

Preusser leads Kurt away with a dismissive wave

PREUSSER
Money always makes money You know how
it is But no artist should have to talk
about his work like that He just wants
to prove to his successful family that he
can be successful even without them
Money is all that counts for that
(a sudden moment of introspection)
Whereas I want to prove to my
unsuccessful family that I can be
successful in spite of them Money is all
that matters there too Families
its all shit

They walk on past studios and exhibition rooms Preusser
doesnt consider of interest

PREUSSER
But you must be younger than 26 when you
get the idea Otherwise it’s no use

KURT
Why

PREUSSER
Just think about it Picasso was 26 for
Les Demoiselles dAvignon Duchamp was 25
when he painted Nude Descending a
Staircase And Michelangelo was 24 when
he did the Pieta

The next studio Preusser guides Kurt into contains a few
bizarre wooden constructions The wooden framework of a
gazebo the individual beams connected by potatoes Anda
wooden stool with a hole in the middle of the seat where
a stick hangs down attached to an electric motor as the
stick turns the potato at the end of it revolves around
another potato on the floor

A slightly effeminate gaunt young man with very long
blond hair yellow sunglasses and a beige polo neck is
operating the machine He is explaining it to a child
who looks fascinated

PREUSSER
What do you call that

ARENDT IVO
Device to make a potato circle another

PREUSSER
No more dots

ARENDT IVO
(innocently shaking his head)
At the moment Im more interested in
potatoes

PREUSSER
This is Kurt From the East Painter
Wants to study here

Ivo shakes hands with Kurt giving him a friendly smile

ARENDT IVO
So I suppose Harry already subjected you
to his speech about the idea

KURT
You dont believe it

ARENDT IVO
If you are looking to create the supreme
masterpiece it might be right I mean
mastery has to be measured somehow But
personally Im more interested in
potatoes

PREUSSER
Come on before you get corrupted

Ivo gives Kurt a friendly farewell smile
As they walk away

PREUSSER (CONTD)
Arendt Ivo what he wants nobody knows
He used to do everything in big dots all
the same color that he printed on

boards Could have been a real idea And
now that And in a couple of months hell
be doing something completely different

Preusser and Kurt have come to the end of a long
corridor Here there are a large number of visitors
crowded round a series of windows overlooking another
studio

Brightly illuminated standing between semi-abstract
water-colors that seem to have been painted with blood or
liquid soil a man in a beige safari suit fedora and
fisherman’s vest is working with a white mass He spreads
the oily substance he takes from a tub with a spatula
into the corners until it fills them completely He seems
entirely engrossed in what hes doing All around him
there are rolls of black-grey felt placed upright and as
tall as a oman Kurt is not unmoved by the whole
spectacle

PREUSSER (CONTD)
(with a certain pride)

Our Professor Antonius van Verten But
I guess youve heard of him even in
Saxony

Kurt shakes his head

PREUSSER (CONTD)
A true original Hed probably like me
to say legend Always wears that hat
One time a really sexy student seduced
him - just to see him without the hat

He grins over at Kurt

PREUSSER (CONTD)
He kept it on even in bed
(he laughs)
Only works with felt and animal fat Why
(mocking but also envious)
That remains his big legendary secret
Sometimes he uses rabbit blood He told
the sexy student that when he was a kid
he once shot a rabbit - and never
recovered from it We have to attend all
his lectures - they’re obligatory - but
he never looks at anything we do He says
the only person who knows if youre doing
it right is yourself I think he simply
doesnt care about us Well We dont
care about him either

Preussers dismissal doesnt sound too convincing Kurt
gazes in fascination at the wild movements of the
mysterious teacher

PREUSSER (CONTD)
But whether youre accepted whether you
get a studio - its all completely up to
this madman

Preusser senses that Kurt is impressed by van Verten

PREUSSER (CONTD)
Come on hes not that interesting

Soon they come to a large studio which is packed with
canvases and sculptures all covered in hundreds of
nails Several people are standing in front of them
gazing at them

KURT
(dryly)
So this is one of those ideas

Preusser ignores him because a very attractive young
woman is standing in front of one sculpture which looks
like a small tree of nails

PREUSSER
(to the young woman)
Does it appeal to you this sculpture

YOUNG WOMAN
Yes

Preusser picks up a few nails and a hammer from a work
table and starts working on the sculpture

YOUNG WOMAN (CONTD)
(overwhelmed)
You are the artist

His practiced movements indicate that he is

PREUSSER
Its still not quite right I can only
see that now youre standing next to it
(gestures to her with his palm upright)
Thats right
(gestures to his sculpture)
That isnt

YOUNG WOMAN

(blushing)
What are you trying to express with this
work

PREUSSER
(gravely with emphasis)
Precisely what youre experiencing right
now

The girl is suitably impressed Preusser presents her
with a nail and a meaningful look She takes it as if it
were a holy relic and walks on dazed Preusser gazes
after her while Kurt takes a closer look at the works

PREUSSER
I was 23 by the way

108 INT DUSSELDORF ACADEMY OF ART - VAN VERTEN’S OFFICE -

DAY
There is something inexplicably artistic even about his
office Van Verten again wearing his hat and fishermans
vest is looking through Kurts application form Kurt is
sitting opposite him
CLOSE SHOT OF APPLICATION FORM

Under Age Kurt has written 26

VAN VERTEN
You havent submitted a portfolio

KURT
I wasnt able to bring anything with me

VAN VERTEN
What have you done up to now

KURT
Painting
VAN VERTEN
In East Germany
KURT
Yes
VAN VERTEN

Socialist realism

It is more a statement than a question so no reply is
required

Van Verten picks up a West German tabloid newspaper the
Bild and points to a headline about the construction of
the Berlin Wall along with a photograph of the massive
undertaking

VAN VERTEN
So now they really have built a wall Did
you feel that coming

KURT
Nobody has the intention - always means
precisely the opposite is true

Van Verten studies the photograph closely speaking
almost to himself

VAN VERTEN
But somehow its almost art that wall -
a piece of landscape art The

craftsmanship involved in the execution
is completetly un-interesting hundreds
of thousands of people have problems with
it

(shaking his head)

Consistent German madness

Kurt has nothing to say to this Van Verten puts the
newspaper down

VAN VERTEN (CONTD)
What kind of art do you like

Kurt shrugs his shoulders genuinely stumped He honestly
doesnt know His sincerity impresses van Verten who
looks up and gazes at Kurt for a long time

VAN VERTEN (CONTD)
You dont like talking about yourself do
you But your eyes tell me that you have
seen more than any of us

He signs the application form and stamps it twice once
with Enrolled and once with Studio

VAN VERTEN (CONTD)
These are the only conditions for you
just like everybody else
(raising one finger)
That you come to the lectures
(raising a second finger)

That you never ask me to look at anything
you do Agreed

Kurt nods

VAN VERTEN (CONTD)
In any case youre the only one who knows
if its good or not

INT DUSSELDORF ACADEMY OF ART - KURT’S STUDIO - NIGHT

Theres a metallic buzz as neon lights come on to reveal
a small industrial studio much smaller than Kurts
workshop in Dresden Smaller than Preusser’s which is
adjoining it we can see the examples of nail art in the
background through the double connecting doors Which are
now open Kurt and Ellie enter the studio

KURT
One step forwards two steps back

ELLIE
Oh come on Dont tell me you cant do
anything you like here

KURT
Yes but if I only knew what that is

She gives him a seductive look and unbuttons her blouse
she isnt wearing a bra underneath She kisses him and
quickly unfastens his belt

ELLIE
Maybe first of all to inaugurate
this studio

110 INT DUSSELDORF ACADEMY OF ART - LECTURE THEATER - DAY

A lecture theater the rows of seats rising towards the
back The ceiling which was destroyed by bombing still
hasnt been replaced Down at the front van Verten is
standing next to a pair of easels both covered in
sheets He pulls away the sheets to reveal the election
posters of Adenauer and Brandt No Experiments - Vote
For Adenauer and Prosperity for Everyone Forwards with
Willy Brandt

VAN VERTEN

Who are you going to vote for The SPD

The CDU
He looks round Some of the students call out SPD
German Piece Union CDU Others whistle and boo in

protest after each party is named
VAN VERTEN (CONTD)
(firmly)
Don’t vote for anyone

It goes very quiet in the lecture theater

VAN VERTEN (CONTD)

Never vote for a party again Vote for
art It is either-or Only in art is
freedom not an illusion Only the artist
can give people back their sense for
freedom after this catastrophe Every
individual whether hes a garbage man or
a farmer has the chance to be an artist
If he develops his own subjective
abilities without limitations If you are
not free completely free then nobody
else will be By making yourselves free
you are making the world free You are
priests revolutionaries liberators
Make your burnt offerings

He then uses a lighter to set both posters on fire at the
bottom The flames quickly rise

111 INT DUSSELDORF ACADEMY OF ART - KURT’S STUDIO - DAY

Kurt is standing over a canvas dripping paint onto it
from a brush like Jackson Pollock The fact that the
shades are a little more monochromatic than Pollocks
doesnt make it more original either Preusser peers
inside and shakes his head mockingly When he has left
Kurt pours the whole bucket of paint over the canvas in
frustration

112 INT DUSSELDORF ACADEMY OF ART - KURT’S STUDIO - DAYS
LATER

Kurt has painted a canvas in beige-orange Now he picks
up a razor blade and is about to apply it to the surface

PREUSSER (O S)
Dont tell me youve joined the slashers

Kurt turns to look at him with a sly expression as if to
say Wait and see and then cuts through the canvas in
three places Red paint begins to ooze through the open
slits like blood from wounds The paint starts dripping
down the canvas Preusser steps closer and sees pouches
full of paint attached to the rear of the canvas He
nods impressed and pats Kurt on the shoulder

PREUSSER
Thats almost an idea You learn fast

MONTAGE

113 INT DUSSELDORF ACADEMY OF ART - KURT’S STUDIO -
DAYNIGHT

- Kurt paints shop-window mannequins

- He builds totem poles

- Now dressed like Andy Warhol he dips a dozen
mounted antlers in white paint

- Preusser glances inside nods in reluctant
admiration and then goes back to his nail creations

114 INT DUSSELDORF ACADEMY OF ART - LECTURE THEATER - DAY

Van Verten again has something on the podium with him
covered in a sheet

VAN VERTEN
What I am now going to show you - is art
You should never be afraid to call art by
that name Most people talk about works
and images and objects By doing so
they diminish their own art I dont want
you to be diminished I want you to make

art And this is art
He pulls away the sheet - to reveal a monumental
sculpture by Arno Breker the Head of the Aryan
warrior The students are horrified People call out

loudly Nazi Down with Nazi art Somebody throws an
apple it hits van Verten hard on the chest He remains
standing motionless Somebody else throws a tin can It
hits him on the head and the cut begins to bleed He
still remains motionless

VAN VERTEN (CONTD)
(calmly almost to himself)

I would like you to have Arno Breker’s
creative power I would like you to
produce a body of work like his

Again he is hit hard by an object that is thrown

VAN VERTEN (CONTD)
I would like you to remain as true to
yourself as he always was to himself
(almost whispering)
Even if like me you cant abide it

INT CLOTHING FACTORY - WORKSHOP - DAY

Ellie is working at a sewing machine among two dozen
other women Hard manual labor But she looks somehow
content as if she had a wonderful secret

Suddenly she looks up and clutches her belly The sewing
machine continues to operate the material bunching up
and tearing Tears spring to her eyes She gets to her
feet swaying slightly

INT CLOTHING FACTORY - TOILET - DAY

Ellie is standing naked at a washbasin scrubbing the
blood from her skirt while tears run down her cheeks
Suddenly she collapes Her body thuds against the door
breaking the flimsy lock Two fellow seamstresses rush
toward her concerned

INT KURT AND ELLIE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

It is dark in the apartment Kurt opens the front door
and turns on the light surprised that nobody appears to
be home But then he sees Ellie sitting in a chair
motionless and pale

ELLIE
The sixth time Kurt This time it was as
far as the third month

Kurt stops in his tracks His clothes are covered with
specks of gray paint

ELLIE (CONTD)
I went to see the doctor I will not be
able to have children

Kurt is shaken He still cant move

ELLIE (CONTD)
And you know what he said It was the
abortion Not cilia damage
(bitterly)
By wanting to keep it so pure he
succeeded in extinguishing his own
bloodline

She begins to weep Kurt kneels next to her holding her
tight

ELLIE (CONTD)
Well never have children Kurt

He is also deeply upset

ELLIE (CONTD)
Your pictures Your pictures have to be
our children Yes Alright

Kurt embraces her in silence He nods

INT DUSSELDORF ACADEMY OF ART - LECTURE THEATER - DAY

Van Verten enters the lecture theater without any work of
art to display looking defeated distracted today He
stands there for a moment as if wondering what he can
talk about Nothing occurs to him He looks in his bag
He finds a catalogue of the works of Wilhelm Lehmbruck
He holds up the book but nobody can see it properly One
of the students sets up an episcope with an extension
cord Van Verten places the book on it and looks at it as
he was seeing theimage for the first time Projected on
the wall is an photo of Lehmbruck’s sculpture Kneeling
Woman

VAN VERTEN
Have you all studied Lehmbruck If
not please do so For your own sakes
He said Each work of art must retain
something from the first days of
creation As if it were still divine

As if it were yet emerging from the
primeval mass from the ribs

Van Verten falters and then stops it is as though the
urge to touch to teach to communicate simply isn’t
there today

VAN VERTEN (CONTD)

No wait perhaps Has anybody had an
insight this week that he can share with
us

He crosses to the wall and pulls out the plug of the
episcope Nobody says anything Then

KURT
Lottery numbers

The other students laugh thinking hes making a joke

KURT (CONTD)
No really The lottery numbers If I say
six numbers at random - 5 7 23 29 44
11 thats just stupid But if I read
you the winning numbers from the
lottery
(picking up a newspaper from the desk of
the student next to him)
- 2 17 19 25 45 48 - then suddenly
they have a true quality something
forceful almost beautiful

More laughter as if he had simply continued the joke
Van Verten looks very serious almost as if he hasn’t
been listening Or as if Kurts words have moved him
deeply

KURT (CONTD)
(disconcerted)
That was my insight

Van Verten fumbles around for a few more moments in his
old leather briefcase Then he looks up at the students

VAN VERTEN
You can go I have nothing for you today

A little surprised the students pack up their things
Kurt too

VAN VERTEN (CONTD)

Kurt would you come over here for a
minute

While the others walk out Kurt comes down to the front
looking anxious When he gets there Van verten waits
until everyone else has left and then turns to face Kurt

VAN VERTEN (CONTD)
I would like to see your art

KURT
When
VAN VERTEN
Whenever you like If you like Just let
me know

Van Verten picks up his bag tips his hat in farewell and

walks out

119 INT DUSSELDORF ACADEMY OF ART - PREUSSER’S STUDIO

EVENING

Kurt is standing next to his friend looking uneasy

while Preusser carries on hammering in his nails

PREUSSER
What is there to think about If he likes
your work you get a gallery and then
you can buy your girlfriend

KURT
Im married

PREUSSER
then you can buy your wife and your
girlfriend a car Soon youll be able to
exchange your pictures for classics Van
Verten swapped a chair covered in animal
fat for a Courbet

KURT
At least there were a few nails in it

Preusser smiles angrily and hammers a little harder

KURT (CONTD)
(honestly)
I just dont know whether its good
enough what Im doing Somehow I feel it
isnt

PREUSSER

But its all subjective anyway And if it
werent subjective it wouldnt be art
it would be craft

Craft An insult

PREUSSER (CONTD)

At the end of the day its all a matter
of luck isnt it And the fact that van
Verten is interested in your stuff for
whatever reason means you’re in luck
Anyway he doesnt want to be wrong
Right now hes ready to discover
something brilliant in your work Dont
stand in your own way

Kurt goes back into his part of the studio and looks at
his pictures The CAMERA shows only his face He doesnt
look convinced Suddenly the hammering stops Preusser
appears behind him He also gazes at Kurts work

PREUSSER
(comforting)
Its good your work Really Its good

INT DUSSELDORF ACADEMY OF ART - KURT’S STUDIO - MORNING

Kurt opens the door Van Verten storms in rushing over
to the pictures in excitement with something akin to
hunger in his eyes But after a few steps his movements
become slower and slower His initial enthusiasm changes
into reservation Silence Van Verten is deeply
disappointed Kurt can see this - and suffers silently

VAN VERTEN
During the war I was a radio operator
with the Luftwaffe I was a terrible
radio operator and my pilot was a
terrible pilot Not really surprising
after only four weeks’ training
(he laughs a little)
We were shot down on our second sortie
over the Crimea The pilot was killed
immediately

EXT CRIMEA —- OPEN FIELD - EVENING (FLASHBACK)

The smoking wreckage of a Junkers JU88 in the rough
sparse countryside In the distance we see a few mud huts

and craters from bombs The pilot’s dead body is hanging
out of the cockpit upside down The canopy of the rear
cabin has been smashed and a young van Verten is inside
covered in blood his head smoking his hair smoldering
Suddenly three Tartar peasants with felt hats APPEAR in
long black leather coats with fur collars

VAN VERTEN (V O)

The Tatar nomads got me out of the

wreckage with burns that really

should

have killed me These peasants the very

peasants I was dropping bombs on
me out of the wreckage

pulled

The nomads extinguish the fire with blankets and haul van

Vertens shattered body out of the plane

VAN VERTEN (V O) (CONTD)

and looked after me using whatever
they had They rubbed animal fat into my
wounds and wrapped me in felt blankets

INT CRIMEA —- MUD HUT - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

An old Mongolian woman pours a little broth between the
wrapped up in

lips of the young Van Verten who is
blankets like a cocoon

VAN VERTEN (V O)
I stayed with them for a year
surrendered to the Americans

Then I

INT DUSSELDORF ACADEMY OF ART - KURT’S STUDIO - DAY

VAN VERTEN
If I ask myself what I truly know
have truly experienced in my life
can claim without lying its the
fat on my skin the homeland of

what I
what I
animal
animal

fat of felt When other people talk to
me about love about women about their
children or about sex - I know what they
mean only because I experienced that fat

and felt on my skin

As he speaks he also seems to experience this

present submerging himself in the feeling

VAN VERTEN (CONTD)

in the

My life before then was totally
uneventful My childhood was happy and
heltered a couple of slaps across the
ars not many

he laughs quietly)

y teachers liked me I wanted to be a
usinessman like my father I didnt
ave any “artistic talent

he shrugs)

nd I havent experienced anything since
hen either Im still cheerful I spent
he last days of the war in an army
ospital with friendly nurses Very
riendly nurses

he laughs quietly again)

Afterwards I had pretty rapid success and
was appointed professor here But the fat

understood them as deeply as Descartes
understood that he existed I think

therefore I am Descartes had questioned
everything Everything Everything could
be an illusion a trick his imagination
But then he understood that something had
provoked that very thought within him
and consequently something must exist
and that something he decided to call
myself But who are you What are
you

He points to the pictures

VAN VERTEN (CONTD)
Not that

He gets to his feet picks up his stick and raises his
hat in a gesture of farewell He therefore allows Kurt to
be the first to see the terrible scars on his bald head
Part of the skull is missing and the rest - even after
20 years - is melted raw flesh As if nothing had
happened as if this has been nothing but a usual polite
greeting he puts his hat back on and vanishes out of the
door

urt doesnt say a thing

He remains there gazing at his pictures Imitations
Without love

The janitor comes in to take out the trash

KURT
Herr Miinster a question

(indicating the pictures)
Can I throw these out with the garbage

The janitor looks round at all the canvases and frowns

JANITOR
No - they wouldnt take that much

KURT
Any idea how I can get rid of it

Kurt enters and turns on the fluorescent lights which

buzz as they come to life

But he only stands there in front of his empty canvas

unable to paint a thing

It is night now Kurt turns off the light He hasn’t

(LATER)

The women have gone through to the kitchen while the men
are sitting at the table

SEEBAND
Re-commence your studies at the age of
30 When I was 30 I was chief physician
in Dresden When Mozart was 30 he was
dead

What can Kurt say in response

SEEBAND (CONTD)
I do understand you dont want any
support from me And thats admirable
(leaning forward and whispering)
But factory work Is that a life you want
for your wife

Kurt looks uneasy

SEEBAND (CONTD)
I have a suggestion I am on good terms
with the director of the gynecology
clinic in Dusseldorf He frequently
invites me there for consultations I’1ll
get you a part-time job there something
suitable Maybe three hours each morning

Agreed Then you’ll have an income and
youll still have time for painting

130 INT MOVING TRAIN - NIGHT

Ellie and Kurt are sitting in silence on the wooden seats
of the third class train compartment digesting the
evening as they travel home

Suddenly Ellie breaks the silence

ELLIE
Can’t he just vanish from our lives Just
leave us alone

KURT
Perhaps the job will help with that

On the staircase which bears a startling resemblance to
the one outside the sign factory 10 years earlier Kurt
is cleaning the large steps even the bucket he uses
looks very much like the one his father had

Kurt is sitting in silence in front of a blank canvas
Dirty Exhausted It doesnt look too likely that hes
about to have a great idea

SEEBAND (V O)
So this is the newest in art White on a
white background

Kurt turns His father-in-law is standing there looking
immaculate the image of power A perfect suit a long
black cashmere coat

SEEBAND (CONTD)

Allegory of Emptiness - that could be
the title Maybe it will be a sensation

ANGLE ON Preusser is listening as Seeband speaks

SEEBAND (CONTD)
Come on Ill take you to dinner My
driver’s waiting

INT ITALIAN RESTAURANT - EVENING

A simple West German Italian restaurant Seeband orders
in Italian for Kurt as well and then hands the menus
back to the waiter He gets straight down to business
taking an envelope out of his slim leather document case
producing from inside it a form and a square of four
passport photographs

SEEBAND
This has to be taken to the passport
office in Bonn so they can issue my
permanent passport Its all ready to be
picked up I was thinking - why don’t you
do it for me That way you can earn a bit
more money Here’s the authorization

He takes a 20 mark note from his briefcase

SEEBAND (CONTD)
The administration fee is 10 marks 50
You can keep the rest Ill call by next
week to pick up the passport Agreed

Kurt nods He cant even bring himself to smile

A newspaper boy enters the restaurant with a thick pile
of BILD papers wedged under his arm

NEWSPAPER BOY
(calls out)
Burghard Kroll Nazi Murderer caught
after 16 years

Kurt looks up Is there any response from Seeband If so
its hardly perceptible Some people in the restaurant
buy a newspaper Not Kurt and Seeband
The meal is served
SEEBAND
(jovially in Italian)

That smells delicious

They start eating

SEEBAND (CONTD)

Kurt its not too late for you to start
something completely new It just has to
be something reasonable Youre a
punctual fellow and not workshy Perhaps
something in Postal Administration I was
just reading that theyre looking for
young men Becoming a civil servant
wouldn’t be a bad idea at all

Seeband produces a silver cigarette case from his inside
pocket opens it and takes a cigarette he then offers to

Kurt who also takes one

KURT
(startled by the realization)
You smoke

Seeband lights his own cigarette and then Kurts
so with great precision and elegance

SEEBAND
63 is the right age to start The
consequences will hardly catch up with
me

He smiles and then glances down at his watch

SEEBAND (CONTD)
You finish your meal take your time Im
afraid I have to dash All my best to
Ellie

He does

He gets to his feet crosses to the waiter and pays
Through the large window of the restaurant Kurt sees his
father-in-law get into the back of the waiting Mercedes
His expression is serious Kurt finishes his cigarette

puts it out and gets to his feet As he crosses

to the

door he sees that a plump CUSTOMER at another table has

put aside the cover section of the BILD newspaper

KURT
May I

The man looks up briefly
MAN
The politics section You can have it

All I need is the sports pages

Kurt takes the newspaper rolls it up and walks
the restaurant

out of

134 INT DUSSELDORF ACADEMY OF ART - KURT’S STUDIO - SHORTLY

AFTERWARDS
Kurt comes back to his studio with the rolled-up
newspaper He sits down on the stool in front of the
blank canvas He places the newspaper on a side table
where it slowly unrolls of its own accord

He stares at the blank canvas for several moments

Preusser appears

PREUSSER
(scornful angry)
White on a white background
Allegory of Emptiness Your father-

in-law
Kurt remains silent

PREUSSER (CONTD)
What an asshole

Kurt still doesnt say anything Preusser comes over
trying to say something comforting

PREUSSER (CONTD)
You know for the first time I’d like
somebody else to succeed more than me

Kurt still doesnt turn round

PREUSSER (CONTD)

Your mistake is that youre still bound
to the easel and canvas Do something
with

(looking round)

- dust or broken glass or rubber
bands Painting is just dead Like folk
dancing and lace-making and silent
movies

Kurt is too demoralized to discuss it

PREUSSER (CONTD)
(with sympathy)
I only want the best for you you know
Otherwise Id just let you go on like
this I mean its too late for us to
become doctors now

urt attempts to give him a friendly smile which doesnt
quite work Preusser goes back into his studio

After staring at the blank canvas for a few more minutes
urt reaches for the newspaper which has now unrolled
itself The headline NAZI MURDERER CAUGHT AFTER 16
YEARS And a black and white picture of Kroll a three-
quarters shot from behind in a hat guarded by a
policeman Underneath the words Burghard Kroll
surrenders to authorities Kurt stares at it for a long
time

Suddenly he picks up a pencil (4B) and a ruler from his
table and quickly draws a grid over the picture

With great dexterity he tears the photo out of the paper
places the canvas sideways on the easel and pins the
photo to it with two drawing pins

He picks up a stick of charcoal and copies the contour of
the picture on to the canvas as an outline

And then he starts painting He copies the photograph
precisely In black and white Until the picture is
finished and is identical to the photograph And yet not
completely identical Underneath the picture he paints
the precise letters of the caption of the newspaper
freehand as he used to do in the poster workshop
BURGHARD KROLL SURRENDERING TO THE AUTHORITIES

The picture is finished One of the canvases is now a
completed painting

Kurt turns off the light

INT KURT AND ELLIE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Ellie is waiting for Kurt She is surprised and
overwhelmed by his ardent greeting before he has even
closed the door he kisses her undresses her and takes
her with a passion he has not shown in a long time

INT UNIVERSITY OF DUSSELDORF GYNECOLOGICAL HOSPITAL -
STAIRS - MORNING

Kurt is washing the stairs with precision and enthusiasm
He looks thoughtful Almost content

INT DUSSELDORF ACADEMY OF ART - KURT’S STUDIO - DAY

Kurt enters with his briefcase full of photographs He
chooses one of them

Kurt’s POV a sort of POV OF THE PHOTOGRAPHS When he has
chosen a picture he draws a grid on it and pins it to the
easel

It is a picture of Aunt Elisabeth as a young woman
holding little Kurt She is smiling while little Kurt is
gazing into the camera with a precociously serious
expression

The picture takes shape on the canvas Kurt even
recreates the texture of the photograph and the serrated
edge

FLASH HIS LAST MEMORY OF AUNT ELISABETH AS SHE IS TAKEN
AWAY AND MOUTHS THE WORDS THROUGH THE WINDOW OF THE
AMBULANCE NEVER LOOK AWAY HIS BLURRING OF THE IMAGE
SO IT WOULD BE BEARABLE

urt gazes at the picture he has just painted not yet
content with it Something is missing He picks up a fine
brush and uses it to blur the sharp contours

Then he places the picture of Kroll’s arrest on the easel
and also blurs the contours here Only now do the
pictures gain their full force

urt goes out of the room to fetch something

Preusser enters the empty studio and sees the two
pictures of Kroll and Aunt Elisabeth

urt comes back with the episcope from the lecture
theater

PREUSSER
(points to the pictures)
Whats this

KURT
I dont know either But I think thats
it
PREUSSER

(genuinely baffled)
Painted copies of photographs

Kurt laughs and closes the blinds Preusser goes back
into his studio Kurt has to close the interconnecting
doors to make his studio dark enough

KURT
Sorry

He turns on the episcope pointing it at the blank
canvas He puts a photograph under the episcope We dont
see what the picture is but from his reaction we see
that it doesnt have the effect he wants He exchanges it
for another photograph Still no good And another

Then he sees Seeband’s envelope on the table He opens it
and takes out the passport photographs He looks at them
and puts them underneath the episcope That’s it

He starts painting All four of the passport photographs
in one picture Seeband’s perfect poses each very
slightly different

He opens the large wooden shutters and the room becomes
bright again He leaves one of the windows open to get
some fresh air and gazes at the picture in the light of
day Its ready He puts it with the other two now he
has three finished paintings

He looks more closely at the picture of Aunt Elisabeth
He sees one place where a brushstroke is not quite
perfect and puts it back on the easel to fix it

A slight gust of wind causes one of the shutters to swing
closed In the darkness the projected passport
photographs can suddenly be seen on the canvas alongside
he picture of Aunt Elisabeth For one eerie moment Aunt
lisabeth is standing next to Professor Seeband Then the
hutter swings back open Aunt Elisabeth is all alone
gain

on fA ct

Kurt freezes He crosses to the window hesitates and
then closes the shutter again looking almost
apprehensive The pictures fit together curiously well

He places a fresh canvas on the easel and starts
painting

Aunt Elisabeth and Professor Seeband together again
after 20 years

Once more Kurt changes the image he is projecting on the

canvases now Burghard Kroll is projected over the
picture Almost like in a feverdream the heads are so

close that they seem to be born out of one another the
face of the accusing child in between

INT KURT AND ELLIE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Ellie and Kurt now just as close together He is lying
on top of her as they did so many years ago in Wiener
Strasse They are bathed in sweat breathless Kurt moves
one arm slightly so his body covers hers precisely

INT UNIVERSITY OF DUSSELDORF GYNECOLOGICAL HOSPITAL -
STAIRS - DAY

Cleaning the stairs in the hospital has become a welcome
exercise Kurt is in a world of his own

Suddenly Seeband enters through the main door with a
group of other medical dignitaries He comes up the
stairs and as they pass Kurt Seeband clearly sees him
but doesnt say anything When they have vanished above
him Kurt carries on washing the stairs

INT DUSSELDORF ACADEMY OF ART - KURT’S STUDIO - DAY

Kurt is just stretching a new canvas when the door to his
studio opens

SEEBAND (0C)
(harsh arrogant)
I imagine you will understand why I
didnt introduce you this morning It
would not have been appropriate

He hangs his coat on a hook next to the door

SEEBAND (CONTD)
Well how is the world of art And even
more importantly do you have my
passport Ive come to collect it

Now he turns —- and sees in front of him the picture of
Burghard Kroll

FLASH KROLL AND SEEBAND AT THE MEETING IN THE FUHRERS
CHANCELLERY 20 YEARS EARLIER

He sees the picture of Aunt Elisabeth

FLASH THE YOUNG AUNT ELISABETH DESPERATELY CLUTCHING HIS
LEGS AND BEING DRAGGED AWAY BY THE ORDERLY

He sees the picture of himself

And then Seeband sees the picture of them altogether
bodies and faces superimposed united

Seeband’s face twitches But he cant look away

Preusser enters Seeband looks over at him briefly
confused then at Kurt and then back at the pictures

For the first time Seeband is not at all an imperious
figure All his authority has vanished He is a scared
old man Very weak A little man who is petrified of
Kurt

SEEBAND (CONTD)
I have to go Im afraid Thank
you excuse me

He backs out as if unwilling to turn his back on the
paintings His posture bent He takes his coat drapes it
over his arm and backs out of the door closing it behind
him

Preusser looks over at Kurt

PREUSSER
Have you ever seen anything like that
What did you say to him What was wrong
with him

Kurt is also staring over at the door incredulously
still in agitation and excitement over what just
happened

KURT
(honestly)
No idea

The spell has been broken

MONTAGE

141 INT UNIVERSITY OF DUSSELDORF GYNECOLOGICAL HOSPITAL -
STAIRS - DAY

As Kurt is washing the stairs this time almost with a
smile on his face the door opens once again - and

Preusser enters with Arendt Ivo and Adrian Schimmel Each
of them is carrying a bucket and they start helping
Kurt fooling around With a group of them doing the
dirty work it turns out to be lots of fun

INT KURT AND ELLIE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Kurt opens the door Ellie walks towards him gravely
graciously striding steadily like a queen

KURT
If you knew how beautiful you look right
now

ELLIE

Im pregnant
He is staggered

ELLIE (CONTD)
The fourth month I went to the doctor
The fourth month We are going to be
parents

Kurt sinks to his knees and embraces her pressing his
head against her belly kissing her belly weeping

Ellie herself can hardly believe it and also starts
weeping

ELLIE (CONTD)
We are going to be parents We are going
to be parents

145 INT DUSSELDORF ACADEMY OF ART - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE KURT’S

STUDIO - DAY

Kurt is standing in the corridor with his camera talking
to Ellie who is inside his studio and peering out Only
her head is visible

KURT
Its Sunday There’s nobody here I
promise

Finally she steps out of the studio looking nervous She
is completely naked He leads her to the stairs runs
down to the floor below and stands on the landing
looking up at her

KURT (CONTD)
Please there’s nobody here Please like
yesterday Please tell me again And then
come down the stairs

Ellie is hesitant at first but then resolves that if
shes going to do this she will either have do it with
absolute dignity or not at all

ELLIE
(quietly)
Im pregnant

And now she comes down the stairs moving with gentle
majestic steps her head slightly lowered Kurt is so

impressed that he forgets for a moment to take a
photograph Then he does so

146 INT DUSSELDORF ACADEMY OF ART - KURT’S STUDIO -

DAYNIGHT

Kurt is painting a huge canvas the biggest he has ever
stretched It is his monumental picture Nude on
Staircase He has to climb a ladder to finish it

Kurt opens the shutters and light floods into the
studio Preusser Arendt Ivo and Adrian Schimmel are
standing here looking at the painting

HIGH ANGLE WE SEE THE MEN FROM BEHIND THE CANVAS THE
TOP OF THE CANVAS IN THE BOTTOM EDGE OF THE SHOT

Kurt looks over at his friends almost shyly They are
engrossed in gazing at the picture

PREUSSER
Now thats not potatoes is it

Ivo is about to respond but decides to continue looking
at the picture instead

PREUSSER (CONTD)
Should we show it to van Verten I think
we could find a gallerist for it

ADRIAN
Oh what the hell This doesnt deserve a
provincial gallerist Kurt what do you
say I become your gallerist

PREUSSER
Adrian Schimmel the gallerist

ADRIAN

wisdom of his choice

INT DOCUMENTA KASSEL —- DAY
INSERT TITLE Kassel 1968

A large modern exhibition hall with Kurts paintings
hanging on the walls some framed A group of journalists
are here for the preview strolling from one picture to
the next gazing at them with interest They are making
notes and recording their comments in Dictaphones

So here they are the Nurses the portrait of Kurts
father as Johann with Dog Uncle Giinther as Soldier
Aunt Elisabeth and Kurt as Mother with Child The
Seebands are Family at Beach the portrait of Seeband’s

INT DUSSELDORF ACADEMY OF ART - ANTONIUS VAN VERTEN’S
OFFICE

Van Verten enters his office There is a painting on his
desk wrapped in paper with the traditional red bow He
opens it It is the overlapping portrait of Seeband
Kroll Aunt Elisabeth and young Kurt

Van Verten sits down and gazes at it He smiles
seriously Then he picks up a hammer hammers a nail into
the wall and hangs the painting behind his desk

BACK TO SCENE

INT DOCUMENTA KASSEL - DAY

About 80 folding chairs have been set up on one side of
the exhibition hall facing a podium with a table covered
in a black cloth and two chairs

Attendants guide the journalists over to the press
conference Kurt is sitting on the podium with the
director of documenta ARTHUR KASTNER

Ellie is standing at the back of the room a one-year-old
child in her arms a little girl Kurt smiles over at
her She raises the baby’s arm and waves back with it
Adrian Finck is standing next to Ellie excited but
happy

Arthur Kastner taps the microphone

ARTHUR KASTNER
Are there any questions for Kurt Barnert

He looks round The last of the journalists are taking
their seats

ARTHUR KASTNER (CONTD)
Then perhaps I will put the first
question Herr Barnert most of your
pictures are based on amateur photographs
or magazines But the picture Nude on
Staircase is surely a homage to Duchamp

KURT
Yes

Anybody who was expecting a longer explanation is
disappointed A sprinkle of laughter Kastner takes it
with good humor

JOURNALIST 1

The magnificent painting Mother and
Child we can see here Who is depicted
there You and your mother

Kurt begins to speak but we can hardly hear
technician pushes the microphone closer to him

KURT
No Its just a snapshot It doesnt
really matter to me who I paint

The journalists murmur together
JOURNALIST 2

But if you paint a portrait you must
know the person

KURT
Its actually better if I dont know
them

Sounds of astonishment

KURT (CONTD)
Then I see better what is really there

JOURNALIST 2
Is that the reasoning behind the passport
photographs from a machine A photograph
without an author

KURT
Yes

JOURNALIST 2
So by painting an army officer you are
not making a statement about the German
Army

KURT
No I dont make statements I make
pictures Photographs Photographs by
other means

JOURNALIST 3
If you take even the composition from a
snapshot - surely that means everything
is very random

KURT
Not random Real Genuine Consistent
Only reality is consistent Every reality
is consistent

him A

JOURNALIST 4
What do you mean by that

KURT
If I say six numbers now it’s just
stupid meaningless But if the six

numbers are the winning numbers from the
lottery then they mean something they
have coherence value almost beauty
and truth Thats how it is with the
photographs I want the truth

The journalists look impressed but also confused
gazes at them calmly with his steel-gray eyes

The baby begins to cry Ellie tries to calm her
theres no point She gives Kurt a surreptitious
wave and walks off

can see

ARTHUR KASTNER
Yes Herr Meybert your question

JOURNALIST 5
What will be next for you More painted
slightly blurred copies of photographs

KURT
No Ive had enough of them for a while
Right now Im interested in color charts

JOURNALIST 5
Color charts

Yes

JOURNALIST 3

Magazine images chosen at random
passport photographs from machines
snapshots from family albums - all

painted in blurry style With these
pictures which admittedly have genuine
force in some mysterious way Kurt
Barnert seems on his way to becoming one
of the leading artists of his generation
- in painting a supposedly long dead
medium But like so many of his
generation he has no statement to make
no stories to tell and nothing to say
He is rejecting artistic tradition side-
stepping the auto-biographical and is
thus creating perhaps for the first time
in the history of art a body of work
in which the artist is almost irrelevant

The camera CLOSES IN on the picture of Mother with
Child behind him until the reporter is OUT OF SHOT

JOURNALIST 3 (OC CONT’D)
Was that good

Adrian drives off Kurt turns up the collar of his coat
and sets off through the cold night

He comes past a large bus station there must be 20 buses
here After hesitating briefly he walks towards them

153 EXT KASSEL — CENTRAL BUS STATION - NIGHT

LONG SHOT we see Kurt walk up to the cab of one bus and
speak to the driver

Through the windshield of the bus we see the driver pick
up his radio and talk to the other drivers

Kurt takes up position in the center the buses all
around him One of them hoots its horn and then another
In the last 25 years the quality of bus horns has
improved A dozen buses are now hooting creating a deep
dense moving drone Kurt opens his arms as if to draw in
the sound and closes his eyes He looks happier than ever
before
