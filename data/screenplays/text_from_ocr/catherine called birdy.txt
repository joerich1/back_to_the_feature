CATHERINE CALLED BIRDY

Written by

Lena Dunham

Based on the book by Karen Cushman
EXT STONEBRIDGE VILLAGE- DAY

A sunny day for a cottage-raising All the villagers are

helping mixing daub (mud straw) to construct a peasant’s
house Children play Baby hogs run amok as they are chased
by a pig farmer

It’s all business as usual a well oiled machine until one
irascible GIRL hurls a bunch of daub at a BOY In turn the
boy hurls some daub at the girl who responds by dumping a
bucket of the stuff over his head Soon all the other kids
are hurling daub too Now the adults It’s a daub fight More
villagers join in and soon they all look like clay figurines
covered in mud a gleeful abstraction

INT STONEBRIDGE MANOR- GREAT HALL- MOMENTS LATER- MORNING

The year 1290 The place a manor house- not the nicest but
not the worst either the 13th Century equivalent of a large
suburban home that hasn’t been painted since the 1980s Light
shines through the windows onto glinting gold goblets
Tapestries hang luxuriously Harp music wafts through like a
gentle dream Barry Lyndon would fucking love this place

Suddenly a crash and a boom as a mutt barks and runs through
the hall followed by a goat a pig another goat a sheep
and the muddy BOY and then behind them the muddy GIRL her
mousy hair streaming behind her Even as she bolts we can
tell she’s a mess all elbows and knees and reckless energy
like an Olde English EloiseMatilda combo This is Catherine
also known as Little Bird but to us she’s BIRDY

Birdy our protagonist a playful 14-year-old with a sharp
bite of disdain for the conventions of her time She shrieks
past animals and servants and the boy and up the stairs
calling for MORWENNA her nurse (an inward sparkplug never
smiling but always amused She is carrying a fire poker and
her apron is covered in soot)

BIRDY
Morwenna MORWENNA I NEED
MORWENNA

INT STONEBRIDGE MANOR- BIRDY’S HALLWAY- MOMENTS LATER-
MORNING

The boy PERKIN a goatherd with a limp and a pubescent
emerging mustache knocks at Birdy’s chamber door
PERKIN
Birdy the game’s not through
Youre always quitting you piddle-
pie

BIRDY (0S)
GO AWAY PERKIN

INT STONEBRIDGE MANOR- BIRDY’S CHAMBER- MOMENTS LATER-
MORNING

A lady-like room adorned with tapestries a canopy bed a
birdcage full of colorful little cockatiels imported from
exotic lands Inks paints and vellum on the massive carved
mahogany desk Abandoned spinning at the base of her bed
yarn tumbling to the floor Bottles of stolen ale half a
loaf of bread evidence of her laziness (she is doing
everything she can to distress her surroundings)

MORWENNA
And to think I just bathed you a
fortnight ago What a waste
Cottage-raisings are not for young
ladies

BIRDY
Morwenna I did it I released the
pigs and I am not ashamed They are
only headed to slaughter and I will
not allow other animals to live
lives of captivity like mine

MORWENNA
Like yours Birdy you are the most
well fed captive I know

BIRDY
And anyhow I have a matter more
pressing

(she leans in to whisper)
Perkin has just told me how babies
are made and I am afraid I shall
perish with revulsion

Morwenna shakes her head starts to fold some scattered
clothing items- she is used to her young charge’s outbursts

MORWENNA
You had to learn sooner or later
Birdy You’re fourteen there’s no
need to spin your head
BIRDY
Morwenna am I to move on calmly
with what I know now A man is
going to take a heated iron poker
and stick it up my nose until
there’s a space big enough for his
whole thumb after which he will
PRESS seeds into my BRAIN

Morwenna starts to laugh

BIRDY (CONT’D)
And then they trickle down my
throat to my guts where they take
root for nine months before popping
out my bum NO NO

Morwenna is laughing even harder unable to contain her
desperate amusement until Birdy understands she’s been had

BIRDY (CONTD)
Oh I shall murder Perkin He will
bleed worse than if I stuck a spike
up his--

Over Birdy’s raging her VO rises

BIRDY (VO)
Corpus bones It is I Birdy

OVER THE IMAGE A HAND WRITES AS IF ON AN ILLUMINATED
MANUSCRIPT

And to the abominable Robert
EXT STONEBRIDGE MANOR- YARD- SAME TIME- MORNING

Birdy runs past the gate house where she gags at the sight
of her brother ROBERT (18 a mini-me of his pops who is
himself fencing the air ineffectually)

ROBERT
Birdy leave me be please

Birdy grabs Robert’s sword from him unwieldy and massive in
her hand and does big bold moves at the sky Her father
sweaty and exhausted passes her grabbing it back in one
easy motion

BIRDY (VO)
Of the village of Stonebridge in
the shire of Lincoln in the
country of England in the hands of
God

Birdy greets Perkin the goat boy with a limp who she chased
earlier He is cheerful and determined despite the challenge
of running with a disability

PERKIN
(singing in old English)
Put your clothes on don’t refuse
Breeches gloves and also shoes

Birdy joins him singing and they hold hands and spin
BIRDY AND PERKIN
Hat on head for rain or sun
Buttons - do up every one
They collapse laughing
BIRDY (VO)
And friend of Perkin my heart’s
brother Although he is just a goat
boy he is kind of heart and wise
of spirit
He sticks his butt out and farts at her
BIRDY (VO)
Though he is sorely afflicted with
wind in his bowls

INT STONEBRIDGE MANOR- BIRDYS CHAMBER- MORNING

Birdy toils over her spinning tangling it
BIRDY (VO)
14th Day of August

The date loops across the screen in the same wobbly cursive
as the title

BIRDY (VO)
Tangled my spinning again What a
torture I would rather be fed to a
stroppy dragon than try and spin
like a lady

She is corrected by Morwenna who has clearly surrendered her
own life in service of raising a good young noblewoman

INT EXT STONEBRIDGE MANOR- PRIVY- AFTERNOON

Birdy runs her tangled spinning in her hands and deposits
it in the toilet

BIRDY (VO)
I am thank the lord very cunning
Most girls are though we are not
given due credit for it

Using a long stick Birdy stuffs the spinning deeper into the
actual hole that the people of the manor ahem piss and shit
in

BIRDY (VO)
But I have a fantastic update I
have made a bargain with my mother
I may forego spinning my greatest
agitation of all as long as I
write this account of my days for
my brother Edward the monk

INT STONEBRIDGE MANOR- BIRDYS CHAMBER- NIGHT

Birdy wearing her nightdress sits at her desk and writes in
her little book

BIRDY (VO)
In his letters he tells me he
believes it will help me grow less
childish and more learned

EXT STONEBRIDGE FIELD- AFTERNOON

Birdy runs overjoyed
BIRDY (VO)
So what follows will be my book-
the book of Catherine called
Little Bird or Birdy

She moves toward camera and then just past it

INT EXT STONEBRIDGE MANOR- GOAT BARN- DAY

Birdy sits on the hay looking through a bound book of Latin
phrases Next to her sits Perkin

Nearby MEG (lovely a little older than Birdy in modern
parlance a ditz) is braiding something She shyly ties it
around Birdy’s wrist

MEG
A golden braid for my golden lady

TEXT ON SCREEN

friend when I can stop her from
curtsying and my lady-ing me

BIRDY

This is hay but I do love the
sentiment It’s beautiful

(back to her book)
Est pater meus animalis

(she smiles)
It means my father is a beast The
best words I’ve learned You are so
lucky your father is dead

PERKIN
Birdy I’m still actually quite
upset about that
INT STONEBRIDGE MANOR- BIRDY’S CHAMBER- DAY
Birdy continues to mindlessly spin yarn with Morwenna
BIRDY (VO)

My truest passions are avoiding my
chores
Outside the window she watches

EXT STONEBRIDGE MANOR- MORNING

On the grass in front of the manor Birdy’s father Lord Rollo

passes drunkenly fencing a peasant This is a man who was

at one point beautiful and naughty playful and present But
the cost of running a village of trying to win at Lordship

is that you must fight to maintain convention And he is
fighting

ROLLO
Fight harder

The peasant fights back

ROLLO (CONT’D)
Now less hard I want to win

BIRDY (VO)
Critiquing my father’s horrible
swordplay
Birdy walks through their flower garden
ROLLO
Birdy walk upon the paths What

are you a milkmaid

BIRDY
I didn’t see a path

Her father drops his sword to tend to the flowers

Birdy lies on the ground listening through the crack under
the door

BIRDY (VO)
And listening thru doors I should
not listen thru

INT STONEBRIDGE MANOR- SOLAR- SAME TIME- DAY

Rollo speaks to a nerdy uptight STEWARD who looks way too
young for the job and is clearly panicked

ROLLO
How has this happened Finneas
You were hired to prevent this

The Steward paces concerned

STEWARD
In essence sir You have ignored
me You have spent profligately my
lord and without censure

ROLLO
I cannot have spent so much
(considering)
Give me one example of an expense
that was not strictly necessary for
my family to survive

STEWARD
Really
EXT STONEBRIDGE MANOR- DAY (FLASHBACK)

A cart approaches driven by a swarthy TIGER SALESMAN Rollo
Robert and Birdy await thrilled

ROLLO
My tiger has arrived

The back of the cart opens and Rollo peers inside

ROLLO (CONT’D)
It is dead

TIGER SALESMAN
The travel was harsh from Siberia
lord

Beat

ROBERT
Mayhap it is just sleeping father

BIRDY
Tis not breathing you fool

ROLLO
(unfazed)
How soon may I have another

Watching through her spyglass Aislinn shakes her head

INT STONEBRIDGE MANOR- SOLAR- PRESENT MOMENT- DAY
Rollo moans

ROLLO
Am I to live like a peasant on
bread and water and chat alone

EXT STONEBRIDGE MANOR- HALL OUTSIDE SOLAR- SAME TIME- DAY

Birdy is still spying when a hunting dog (the same one from
the first scene) comes bounding down the hall It notices
Birdy and begins to bark

BIRDY
Shhh

It growls tugging at her skirt She tries to crawl away but
it keeps on tugging She stands dragging the dog down the
hall with its jaw firm around her skirts

BIRDY (CONT’D)
(muttering)
Untooth me hound

INT STONEBRIDGE MANOR- SOLAR- DAY
Disrupted by the dog Birdy misses what is next

STEWARD
If sir you can secure a
profitable union for your only
daughter there is your opportunity
to relieve yourself of this
accumulated debt

ROLLO
A profitable union For Birdy
STEWARD
Yes
ROLLO
With a man
STEWARD
Yes
ROLLO

No no no She’s disgusting She’s
one step away from a leper

Awkward beat

STEWARD
You may not have coins but your
wife has a title and she has given
it to you--

ROLLO
I earned it

STEWARD
(ignoring this)
There are plenty of men foolish
enough to trade their fortune for
the prefix of Lord Now it is your
job to find one

ROLLO
(quieter)
Sir there must be another
answer She is my only daughter

STEWARD
And this is your only manor

The steward bows and exits

STEWARD (CONT’D)
My lord

Rollo lets the shame of his failure wash over his face for a
beat then reaches for the flask in his waist belt

INT STONEBRIDGE MANOR- KITCHEN- DAY

Birdy is gnawing on an apple avoiding the wormhole when she
feels a pair of eyes on her back It is her father regarding
her studiously

BIRDY (VO)
Something is astir

She takes another cautious bite

BIRDY (VO)
I can feel my father’s eyes
following me wherever I go

Birdy takes a step to the left Her father behind her does
the same- an odd waltz

BIRDY (VO)
He is regarding me as he would a
bull bought for breeding

He circles her looking her up and down

ROLLO
Exactly how old are you

Beat

BIRDY
I am fourteen years

Beat

BIRDY (VO)
I am surprised that he has not
asked to examine my hooves

ROLLO
Have you all your teeth

BIRDY
All but one

ROLLO
And you are certainly a good eater
What color is your hair when it is
clean

BIRDY
When it’s clean Blue

ROLLO
(giving up)
Very good Nice to see you Go and
see your little goat friend now

BIRDY (VO)
What is brewing here

Rollo walks away down the hall
ROLLO
(sotto convincing
himself )
Fourteen That isn’t that young

INT STONEBRIDGE MANOR- PRIVY- AFTERNOON
Birdy opens the door clutching her guts and slams it shut
She settles onto the toilet holding up her skirts when she
catches sight of her petticoat Her eyes grow wide
INT STONEBRIDGE MANOR- BIRDYS CHAMBER- MOMENTS LATER-
AFTERNOON

Birdy paces inconsolable while Morwenna tries to
understand

BIRDY

I am dying It is plain to see
MORWENNA

Oh what did Perkin tell you this

time
Birdy brandishes her bloody petticoat from behind her back

MORWENNA (CONT’D)
In the name of the father Birdy

BIRDY

I must say my goodbyes and get on
with good humor I will go bravely
and with God in my heart Please
give my brooch to my future sister
and my bible to my brother Edward
and tell him I am sorry I got
pudding upon the pages

(beat)
You see the blood came from my
bum

MORWENNA
(skeptical)
Your bum

Birdy spreads her skirts and her spindly legs Morwenna
shakes her head then looks (despite her inherent prudishness
keeping this child alive is her job)

MORWENNA (CONT’D)
Oh for the love of a God greater
than I Birdy it comes from the
other hole

BIRDY
What other hole

MORWENNA
It is your monthly tiding The lady
in red So you will do your duty
to bear your husband children

On Birdy’s face a look of alarm as she shakes her head
furiously no no no

BIRDY
Then I shall run away Far I shall
steal a suit of armor and become a
knight and I shall take a horse
and carriage and I shall ride at
midnight--

MORWENNA
Dress as a knight or dress as a
lady the blood will come You are
a woman now Birdy

BIRDY
A woman

Morwenna snaps to
MORWENNA
First of all we are going to make a
pad Rag gets wrapped around hand
She does

MORWENNA (CONT’D)
Make it good and thick

She hands it to Birdy

MORWENNA (CONT’D)
That is a nice wee pad that sits in
your pants

Morwenna holds up a piece of fabric

BIRDY
Are they my father’s

MORWENNA
No These are your pants

BIRDY
My pants

MORWENNA
Give me the pad

Birdy hands it over and Morwenna places the pad in the pants

MORWENNA (CONT’D)
This goes up between your legs and
it’s going to get all the blood and
keep it away from your clothes Can
you manage that

BIRDY
Yes I can Morwenna

Morwenna bends down Birdy roughly steps through the pants

MORWENNA
Don’t do that Just be careful

BIRDY
I am

EXT STONEBRIDGE MANOR- HERB GARDEN- DAY
Morwenna shows Birdy how to gather medicinal herbs

MORWENNA
Now get some mint cause that makes
the whole thing taste nice
Dandelion but not the flower
obviously is perfect for those
cramps

Birdy looks past the bushes and spies Perkin and villagers
GERD and ALF running with a lamb they have dressed in
clothes

BIRDY
Alf Do you have your mom’s
knickers on Wendy’s head

MORWENNA
Oh Perkin what’s he up to now
Dressing up farm animals A lamb
should be dressed in mint sauce
not a hat

INT STONEBRIDGE MANOR- BIRDY’S CHAMBER- LATE AFTERNOON

Morwenna stands over Birdy who sits on the bed tying the
rags around herself

MORWENNA
All those herbs that we picked
Were going to make tea into your
favorite cup

BIRDY
It is my favorite cup

MORWENNA
I know

Morwenna mixes the tea

MORWENNA (CONT’D)
And swirl and dip

She hands the cup to Birdy
MORWENNA (CONT’D)
Take a sip and the pain will be

gone

Birdy chugs the tea that Morwenna brewed nearly spitting up

INT STONEBRIDGE MANOR- BIRDY’S CHAMBER- NIGHT

Morwenna snores while Birdy clutches her tummy resigned to
this horrible feeling but unaware of what it truly means for
her future

INT STONEBRIDGE MANOR- AISLINN’S CHAMBER- MORNING

The nicest room in the house with tapestries and carved
ivory animals from foreign lands On a bed as vast as the sea
sits Aislinn who we can now see is heavily pregnant and
visibly uncomfortable

Up close we can also see she has a burn scar on her neck
ropey and thick the only blemish to her beauty Birdy busts
through the door

From under the bedsheets her father emerges dressing
himself undergarments first Aislinn giggles Her husband
giggles back Birdy is horrified- her parents GIGGLE TOGETHER
in the morning

BIRDY
(looking away)
What were you doing

ROLLO
Birdy knocking is a bit customary
though I know not in the public
houses you frequent

BIRDY
I have never been to a public
house Mumma he lies

ROLLO
I am not lying I am jesting But
in all seriousness I did see Bird
in a public house She was knocking
back glasses of ale swearing
jousting peasants--

BIRDY
Mumma

AISLINN
Well I for one should like my
room free of jesters for the
moment I should like to rest and
do my puzzles

ROLLO
But I have more jests What did the
Pope say to the ale rat

BIRDY
What

Rollo kisses his wife

BIRDY (CONT’D)
Wait but what did the Pope say to
the ale rat

ROLLO
What did the Pope say to the ale
rat What are you talking about

BIRDY
The jest

ROLLO
Has she gone mad

Rollo heads for the exit

ROLLO (CONT’D)
What Pope

BIRDY
(calling after)
Father

He stops in the doorway smiles and turns to face her

ROLLO
Oh yes Ummm

Rollo closes the door and escapes without answering Aislinn
laughs Birdy waits a beat then approaches her mother We can
tell she is planning to tell her something

BIRDY
Mumma

AISLINN
Yes Bird

BIRDY

I have something to tell you It is
rather serious and I hope

Aislinn lets out a little cry clutching her stomach

BIRDY (CONT’D)
Mumma Are you alright

AISLINN
Yes Bird just a little kick
What was it you wanted to say

Birdy regards her mother’s growing stomach huge against the
bed sheets with terror Reminded of what periods lead to
Birdy suddenly thinks much better of it

BIRDY (VO)
Maybe now is not a good time and
perhaps I shall wait forever

Birdy changes topic

BIRDY
Mother there is a hanging today in
Rutherford--

AISLINN
A hanging

BIRDY
An ever so small one Can I maybe
just

AISLINN
(amused)
Absolutely forbidden

BIRDY
But Robert goes to all the
hangings

AISLINN
Robert is Robert And you are not
Anyhow today the Sidebottoms will
join us Your favorite day of the
month

Birdy shrugs

AISLINN (CONT’D)
Come here to me child

Aislinn pulls Birdy to her side

AISLINN (CONT’D)
Rest with your weary mother

INT STONEBRIDGE MANOR- AISLINN’S CHAMBER- LATER- DAY

Birdy and Aislinn take turns with the spyglass to watch a
carriage containing AELIS LADY BERENICE and LORD SIDEBOTTOM
pull up to Stonebridge Manor We see through the spyglass a
distant and distorted bird’s eye view a shot we will return
to again and again to explain Aislinn’s view of the manor and
the world- distant and removed yet all-seeing and knowing
Birdy eagerly waves to her best friend Aelis

BIRDY (VO)
Today Aelis comes She is a dearest
friend to me

BIRDY (VO)
And when I see her face I hear
birds and whistles I see ribbons
and flowers Oh Aelis

EXT STONEBRIDGE MANOR ROAD- SIDEBOTTOM FAMILY CART- DAY

Aelis Berenice and Lord Sidebottom are packed into the cart
as tight as sardines and jostle into each other
uncomfortably as it bumps down the road

Aelis is everything Birdy is not If they had proms in she
would be prom queen If they had Instagram six million
followers would wait for her makeup tutorials Face like a
heart mahogany curls and kind to boot

LORD SIDEBOTTOM Aelis’s father is nearing seventy but still
clanking his old bones together in a push chair that rolls
between the two seats

TEXT ON SCREEN

LORD GIDEON SIDEBOTTOM

- 81 years of age

- oldest man in his province
- oldest father in England

- wears his armour to sleep

BERENICE Aelis’s gorgeous young stepmum looks a thousand
times more bored than AISLINN She is rife with the ennui of
entrapment

Aelis leans over the cart’s edge and shyly returns Birdy’s
joyful wave

EXT STONEBRIDGE MANOR- COURTYARD- MOMENTS LATER- DAY

Birdy and Aelis have sequestered themselves gleefully from
the grownups on a bench Aelis bends down behind Birdy
playing with her hair

AELIS
Your hair is so long Birdy You
need to brush it

BIRDY
I’m going to grow it all the way
down to my feet

They are ambushed by Robert as he exits the Great Hall while
munching on a stolen meat pie He doesn’t notice Aelis

ROBERT
(groaning)
Birdy you must give me some kind
of warningotherwise the sight of
your countenance

He pretends to vomit and drops chewed-up meat pie into his
hand

AELIS
Hello Robert

Robert not having noticed Aelis turns scarlet and tries to
hide his chewed-up meat pie in his other hand Gross He
chucks it aside

ROBERT
(flustered)
Lady Sidebottom Aelis How goodly
to see you You are looking
rather pinkened

AELIS
(giggling)
Robert you are ever so pink
yourself

BIRDY ROBERT
Leave us be Do you ladies need an
escort round the garden It can be
very dangerous

BIRDY
Please go you death monger

Robert exits into the Great Hall

EXT STONEBRIDGE MANOR- GARDEN- MOMENTS LATER- DAY

Rollo and Aislinn stand awkwardly with Lord Sidebottom and
Berenice like parents at the playground with nothing in
common

AISLINN
The roses have been exceptional
this season And of course the
butterflies

LORD SIDEBOTTOM
I hate butterflies

Berenice walks away from the group in distaste Aislinn walks
away to the end of the garden to escape the uncomfortable
conversation and smells some flowers She looks out in
thought Rollo and Lord Sidebottom are left alone

LORD SIDEBOTTOM (CONTD)
We have already had five or six
serious inquiries

ROLLO
Oh is that so

LORD SIDEBOTTOM
And some of these letter are florid
in the extreme But I don’t care if
they’re poets Rollo- I care if
they can pay for my daughter in
gold brick

Rollo laughs nervously

EXT STONEBRIDGE MANOR- COURTYARD- DAY

Birdy pulls a bun out of her pocket and hands it to Aelis

BIRDY
Welcome to Stonebridge Lady Aelis
AELIS
You have buns
BIRDY
We used to have more buns Cakes
too
(whispered)

I think we may be poor now

AELIS
Oh Well we are not poor but there
is nothing to eat at our manor
Papa banished the baker a fortnight
ago He said that he and stepmother
were exchanging wistful glances

They start to munch but are surprised by Berenice walking
straight past them and sitting on the bench

Aelis hides her bun behind her back
AELIS (CONTD)

My lady I promise I’m not spoiling
my supper

BERENICE
I do not give a goat’s arse what
you spoil Aelis I am not your
mother do not cower before me

Lord Sidebottom directs Rollo to push him toward her clearly
unaware of his waning powers

LORD SIDEBOTTOM
Berenice never again will you
leave a convivial grouping when I
am speaking I was about to make a
point of great import--

She’s been writing the most tragic
poetry

Birdy and Aelis giggle

EXT STONEBRIDGE MANOR- HERB GARDEN- AFTERNOON

The girls sit on a stone bench in a picturesque garden of
flowers and medicinal herbs

AELIS

Do you know that my stepmother was
brought to our manor from Gascony
First by boat then by carriage It
took many nights and nobody told
her where she was going She was
only in her seventeenth year Then
father was waiting

(beat)
He sent away for a wife the day
after my mother died

BIRDY
(knowingly)
Men are horribly duplicitous
creatures
(MORE)

BIRDY (CONTD)
I should like to take a carriage
With you Aelis And we would have
adventures Grand ones

AELIS
How will we escape

BIRDY

monk’s robes

AELIS

The girls giggle Birdy pinches Aelis’s cheek

INT STONEBRIDGE MANOR- GREAT HALL- MORNING

CORNETHIA a pretty young nun helps Aelis and Birdy play a
tune on a recorder Aelis sounds lovely Birdy’s screeches

In the background several men carry away valuable items-
panes of glass sculptures a few nice vases- as Rollo and
Aislinn look on Rollo tortured and Aislinn running to and
fro to ensure that the items are being handled with care

BIRDY (VO)
As the time approaches when I must
wed I must undertake lady lessons
My two least favorite words
Together In one terrible phrase

CORNETHIA
Gently young ladies A gentle hand
plays a soothing tune

BIRDY (VO)
Sister Cornethia attempts to make
me musical pious and full of
grace for any suitor who may court

Cornethia turns around and two hand prints of dirt are on the
bum of her habit The girls giggle

CORNETHIA
Do we find our lessons ever so
funny Seems to me a joke is astir

Birdy raises her hands covered in charcoal dust then
quickly hides them behind her back

BIRDY (VO)
But she will find she has no easy
job

Birdy giggles to herself When Aelis then giggles too she
stops icing Aelis out She is being petty

INT STONEBRIDGE MANOR- AISLINNS CHAMBER- MIDNIGHT

A single candle burns as NAN the midwife Aislinn’s
chambermaid and women from the kitchen labor over Aislinn’s
body as Aislinn labors in birth Aislinn sits on a birthing
stool by her bed Nan below her Morwenna at her side

AISLINN
Ahhhh Ahhhh

MORWENNA
(whispered)
O God the Protector of all that
trust in Thee increase and
multiply upon us Thy mercy Amen

In the hall Birdy Rollo and Robert watch Morwenna comes to
the door and exchanges a look with Rollo that says “It’s
time” He heads inside

BIRDY
No I want to meet the baby

AISLINN
Birdy please Go for Mumma

BIRDY
Why does he get to meet the baby

MORWENNA
(harsh whisper)
Only God shall meet this baby

She ushers the kids down the hall

BIRDY (VO)
I will never get used to babies
becoming dead and my heart will
never stop aching for them to live

INT STONEBRIDGE MANOR- PRIVY- AFTERNOON

Birdy squatting pulls the bloody rags from her skirt then
hides them between two floor boards using a stick to push
them deeper still

them over and over forever

Birdy enters through a pair of large French doors into an
open courtyard of corridors surrounding a garden

BIRDY (VO)
My mother usually visits Edward at
the Abbey this time of year but
she still loses blood from the
birth so my father insists I go in
her place We are too poor to offer
the monks any pies anymore I
simply bring myself

We hear humming Birdy notices the centerpiece of the
courtyard a sculpture of a truly ripped Jesus on the cross
Birdy stares at him His abs are a LOT The humming grows
closer and a group of monks round the corner The camera is
high so we see their shuffling slippers and the tops of
their tonsure haircuts The leader a handsome salt and
pepper haired monk bows his head and they all do the same

BIRDY (VO)
I always imagined that Edward lived
among God fearing nutters and rusty
old men who clutched their Bibles
to their chests

As the camera pans down we see they are not in fact old
nutters but young virile men Birdy gasps They grow closer
singing more prayers as they walk

BIRDY (VO)
Oco lala These are monks Why has
no one told me I am ever so
confused what God is getting out
here

She walks around looking for a place to tuck away and settles
on darting into the garden and sitting down by the Jesus
sculpture

As the monks pass one especially handsome dark-haired one
notices her- this is EDWARD

EDWARD
Catherine

He nods an apology to an irritated monk and rushes over
EDWARD (CONT’D)
(hissed)
Whatever are you doing

Panicked Birdy pats the bum of the Jesus sculpture

BIRDY
Just visiting an old friend

EDWARD
Get off Jesus

INT ABBEY CLOISTERS- MOMENTS LATER- DAY

Birdy shuffles along under Edward’s robe hugging him from
behind Edward looks ultra-serious in an attempt to hide his
stowaway He nods at another MONK

EDWARD
Deus sit apud vos

MONK
Deus sit apud vos
INT ABBEY BEDROOM- MOMENTS LATER- DAY

Birdy emerges from her brother’s robe panting and looks
around
BIRDY
How was I to know that comely young
women are a spiritual danger to
monks

EDWARD
You are no danger to anyone but
yourself Does mother heal

BIRDY

In body if not in spirit Our
brute of a father is no help

(beat)
Do you know what I find even worse
than the pains she bears That she
must worry about us always
Forever She can never stop Being
a mother is a terrible job

She picks up a wooden cross and begins to joust with it

EDWARD
Birdy please do not joust with our
crucified savior

BIRDY
Are there no better amusements
here Perhaps a sacred sword used
to slay a pagan

EDWARD
Not a sword in sight

BIRDY
I do not believe you If I were a
boy you would let me see Everyone
lets boys do everything Boring
Edward

EDWARD
Boredom is for the dull-witted
Bird You’re not dull are you

BIRDY
Of course I’m not dull

EDWARD
How comes your reading And the
diary I have tasked you with

BIRDY
I write in my diary everyday and
read the Bible over and over again
(MORE )

BIRDY (CONT’D)
I know all the important prayers by
heart

EDWARD
Bird there is so much more to read
than the bible Even devoted monks
tire of that tome Here I’ve a
gift for you

He pulls a small gold book from his pocket

BIRDY
(disappointed)
Oh good A book

EDWARD
Well now that I have captured your
attention mayhap you will actually
read it It is a book of the
saints Every day a different
saint

Beat as she inspects the book

EDWARD (CONT’D)
Promise me you shall read read and
read some more Write too Knowing
your own story will be your
salvation

BIRDY
Promise

INT STONEBRIDGE MANOR- BIRDYS CHAMBER- NIGHT

Morwenna repairs the hem of Birdy’s torn dress as she writes
in her little book

BIRDY
Mayhap I could be a Saint

MORWENNA
Well for starters I believe
Saints help their nursemaids with
the washing

BIRDY (VO)
Why does Edward want me to read
this book So full of strangers and
their woes Saints are just
dinguses I will never actually
meet

Birdy continues to write

BIRDY (VO)
At the very least I will become an
expert on their gruesome deaths
which are so displeasing that they
please me terribly
(beat)
What does “defenestration” mean

Birdy rests her face in her hands staring practically down
the barrel of the camera as she contemplates what to write
next

EXT STONEBRIDGE MANOR- HERB GARDEN- DAY

Birdy walks back and forth extremely focused wincing We
pan down and see she has set up a line of pointy stones and
she is barefoot

BIRDY (VO)
16th day of October A mission
towards glory

Whenever Birdy states the date it loops across the scene in
her signature script

BIRDY (VO)
I don’t want to be a lady so
perhaps a Saint

Morwenna hanging wash looks at her crookedly

MORWENNA
Birdy Bird put on your shoes for
heavens sake

BIRDY
I cannot If I am to be a saint I
must practice- ouch I must
practice self-sacrifice

MORWENNA
(amused)
Any other jolly plans for this
afternoon

BIRDY
Why yes I am denying myself buns
Then I am sleeping with a comb
beneath my back

(MORE )

BIRDY (CONTD)

For I must emulate Saint Blandina
who was scourged placed on a red-
hot grate enclosed in a net and
thrown before a wild steer who
tossed her into the air with his
horns

(gravely)
Tragically she was killed with a
dagger

MORWENNA
Youll meet a dagger if you don’t
put your bloody shoes on

INT STONEBRIDGE MANOR- PRIVY- AFTERNOON

More rags more stuffing of them in the deepest cracks in the
floor using the stick We see only Birdy’s hands pulling the
rags from her skirts pushing the rags down with her stick

BIRDY (VO)
I cannot believe I must bear this
with good humor month after month
I would prefer a monthly bath in
poo or to wrestle a lion Ah to
wrestle a lion

EXT STONEBRIDGE MANOR- PRIVY- SAME TIME- AFTERNOON

Morwenna keeps watch like a sentinel

INT STONEBRIDGE MANOR- HALLWAY OUTSIDE AISLINN’S CHAMBER-
LATE MORNING

Birdy walks down the hall holding the recorder she has been
given for her lessons She looks at it hatefully She is
passing her mother’s quarters focused with a quaking rage on
the instrument and is about to crack it over her knee when
she hears voices in the room- her parents The recorder
avoids its fate as she stops to listen

INT STONEBRIDGE MANOR- AISLINNS CHAMBER- SAME TIME- LATE
MORNING

Rollo paces already drunk despite the early hour

AISLINN
Rollo why did you not tell me we
had nought to spend

(MORE )

AISLINN (CONTD)
I want only to be your partner to
stand beside you as lady of this
manor--

ROLLO
But lady had to have her garlands
And her silver twine She had to
have apples in her roast and I had
to keep this family from descending
into utter poverty And now Birdy
is our only currency So we’re in
real trouble

INT STONEBRIDGE MANOR- HALLWAY OUTSIDE AISLINN’S CHAMBER-
SAME TIME- LATE MORNING

Hearing this Birdy does attempt destruction of the
instrument It’s stronger then she thought and she lets out a
yelp of pain then runs

EXT STONEBRIDGE VILLAGE- DAY

From the high point on the road we see Birdy watching a wat
and daub fight like the one she participated in early on We
don’t see it just the sounds of glee and play and Birdy
alone clean listening

EXT STONEBRIDGE FIELD- STREAM- LATER- DAY

Birdy sits on the bank while Perkin washes off in the water
alongside young village girls with varied natural bodies of
all shapes sizes and shades

They play and splash at each other Birdy stares confused by
seeing slightly more mature female bodies

BIRDY
Perkin

PERKIN
(suspiciously)
Yes Bird

BIRDY
What do you suppose about kissing

PERKIN
Suppose how

BIRDY
Might it not be so foul as we once
thought

Perkin pauses considering then throws his soaking still
muddy shirt at her It lands on her face

BIRDY (CONT’D)
Gods Thumb it’s slimy

A MAN ON HORSEBACK approaches as they giggle He is fancy
seeming (in modern parlance a metrosexual) with flowing hair
and an obsequious manner

MAN ON HORSEBACK
Good tidings I bring from Kent
where the weather has been finer
than a silk from Kashmir laid out
upon a table for twenty Might I
ask where your mistress is

PERKIN
Our mistress

MAN ON HORSEBACK
Lady Catherine of the manor The
fair cherub I have ridden so far to
see

Birdy swallows takes a beat

BIRDY
And what are your intentions with
our mistress sir

MAN ON HORSEBACK
Indeed if she is as fair and as
decent as goodly as they tell me
then I
(coyly)
I suppose I shall marry her
forthwith

Beat as Birdy processes what is happening

BIRDY
Marry her Lady Catherine Surely
you cannot mean our Lady Catherine

MAN ON HORSEBACK
I do and as I said I have ridden
from Kent to see her for myself
(MORE )

MAN ON HORSEBACK (CONT’D)
With no carriage and no manservant
so urgent was it that I see this
phantom beauty for myself
(beat to himself)
Sorely beating my inner thighs en
route

BIRDY
You needn’t bother Lady Catherine
is well she is
(beat)
A creature A vile creature of
vomit and hair and snot

It takes Perkin a beat to understand but when he does he
joins with gusto nodding vigorously

PERKIN
And some say she has a third ear

BIRDY
She does

MAN ON HORSEBACK
Have you seen this third ear
Where

BIRDY
(no hesitation)
Back of her neck

MAN ON HORSEBACK
Is it functional

BIRDY PERKIN
Spare

MAN ON HORSEBACK
But what of the Catherine I have
heard about With ebony trusses
that tumble like waterfalls The
Lady Catherine with curves like an
archipelago

BIRDY
Archipelago

PERKIN
What is an archipelago

MAN ON HORSEBACK
A small series of little islands I
believe

BIRDY
You’ve been tricked sir It would
seem

MAN ON HORSEBACK
(crestfallen)
Quite cruelly so To dash a man’s
dreams as such

PERKIN
Sir you best be off before Lady
Catherine comes and bares her ugly
head

MAN ON HORSEBACK
I want to thank you actually
(to Perkin)
Youre very dashing
(to Birdy)
You on the other hand have been a
little churlish if I must say so

Birdy curtsies
BIRDY
Thank you very much sir
INT STONEBRIDGE MANOR- ALE CELLAR- AFTERNOON

Birdy storms in on her father meandering about the ale cellar
inspecting bottles one already open in his bloated hand

ROLLO
I will not sneak you a jug of ale
so do not ask it of me

BIRDY
I demand to know the meaning of
this

Now he knows it’s serious

ROLLO
The meaning of what

BIRDY
A man has come and asked for me by
name

ROLLO

Sounds improbable

BIRDY
He hails from Kent

ROLLO
Oh yes Oh yeeessss
(beat)

You must get washed up then

BIRDY
I’ve sent him away

Rollo looks at her the fate of his home and his reputation
lying in her hands

ROLLO
You sent him away

BIRDY
I sent him away I am not
interested in meeting him nor any
man with his intentions

ROLLO
No Go to the high road and get him
back

BIRDY

I am afraid he is quite gone In
fact he galloped away

Rollo starts to grow red imagining his own future
humiliation He reaches for a long wooden object

ROLLO
Hand

He grabs Birdy’s hand and begins to slap her across the palm
with it

On Birdy’s face she doesn’t wail but instead grimaces
refusing to concede any power to her father

BIRDY (VO)
Things girls cannot do

As Birdy lists the following activities we see her wince
once for each impossible dream

BIRDY (VO)

Go on crusades Cut their hair Be
horse trainers Laugh very loud
Marry whom they will Be monks
Drink in ale houses Go to
hangings
Now back to her father’s attempt at justice

ROLLO
You will behave like a lady when
the suitors come or we will all be
living in the cooper’s cellar Do
you understand me

Hearing his bellowing Aislinn enters

AISLINN
Oh Rollo Rollo please stop I
can’t bear it

He stops and looks at his wife

ROLLO
Do you know your daughter has sent
away a perfectly good suitor

AISLINN
Do not rage Rollo over that man
My fathers were kings in Britain
long ago And he is just a simple
wool merchant from Kent

ROLLO
Sweet Judas lady think you we can
eat your royal ancestors or plant
your family name The man stinks of
gold

AISLINN
Rollo please She is young yet
She cannot even bear children

BIRDY
(too emphatic)
No I certainly CANNOT

AISLINN
Just give her some time Give her
some time

INT STONEBRIDGE MANOR- BIRDYS CHAMBER- LATE EVENING
Birdy is writing in her diary
BIRDY (VO)
(beat)

Just one more day until Uncle
George

EXT STONEBRIDGE MANOR- DAY

A VERY SEXY entrance cue for GEORGE Birdy’s much-hyped
uncle He is returning from the crusades and he is gorgeous-—
a 24 year old Robert Redford charming and golden

BIRDY (VO)
After one man brought doom on
horseback another brings divine
hope

He approaches the manor in chain mail on an actual white
horse Aislinn stands at her window with her spyglass waving
a greeting to her brother

Birdy stands outside the castle wind blowing her hair
beaming at her incoming uncle

BIRDY (VO)
My uncle is so unlike any other man
I know he has a twinkle in his
holy green eyes a song on his lips
and all his teeth

It’s Too Perfect

INT STONEBRIDGE MANOR- GREAT HALL- EVENING

Birdy sits across from George having combed her hair and
worn a clean dress as they whisper over dinner

GEORGE
I cannot believe my only sister’s
only daughter is now up to my
shoulder

She practically blushes
TEXT ON SCREEN

Uncle George

- 28 years of age

- Mumma’s littlest brother

- Fought bravely in the crusades
- SO HANDSOME

GEORGE (CONT’D)
When I left you were wearing a
diaper with a big wooden pin A
tiny barbarian the size of a
toadstool

She actually blushes

BIRDY
My mother tells us you were in the
Holy Land wearing a red cross sewn
on a white tunic Nobly fighting
for God and Christ and our King

GEORGE
The truth I’m afraid was much less
picturesque My tunic was covered
in mud and briars

BIRDY
But there was a line of crusaders
Uncle George Reaching from
Jerusalem all the way back to
London

GEORGE

There was a line indeed

(his eyes grow distant

the hush of trauma

descends )
But it was a line of my injured
brothers waiting to have their
wounds dressed Some of them died
standing there waiting

He too sips from a waist flask then tucks into a leg of
fowl Meat juice glistens on his lips but it’s not repulsive
like when her father eats it’s sexy as fuck

It’s magic It’s euphoria It’s first love

INT STONEBRIDGE MANOR- BIRDY’S CHAMBER- NIGHT

Birdy lies horizontal across her bed in her night clothes
while Morwenna turns down her covers Birdy is playing with a
small wooden bear with moving arms and legs

MORWENNA
Will you ever put that little stick
away

BIRDY
It is not a stick It is a little
bear

(under her breath)
A gift from George

MORWENNA
Ooohhh a gift from Geeeooorgie

BIRDY
Quiet

MORWENNA
Georgieee

BIRDY

You are just mad because no one has
ever whittled you a gift most
especially not a bear

MORWENNA
(winking)
No gifts for poor Morwenna To bed

Birdy crawls between the sheets tucking the bear into her
dress as Morwenna blows out the candle

BIRDY (VO)
If I cannot be a hero I will love
a hero instead He will tell my
father he cannot sell me off this
way and he will fight for me

EXT STONEBRIDGE MANOR- COURTYARD- DAY

George and Birdy fence playfully as George teaches Birdy
swordplay tricks and they each attempt to get the best of the
other The scene is shot with the camera operating as the
opposing Cc so that George and Birdy each play with the lens
as if it is their comradefoebuddy The energy is that of
playful home movies as they enter and exit each others
frames collapse on the ground in defeat and generally relax
in a way neither can around other adults

EXT STONEBRIDGE HIGH MEADOW- LATER- DAY

Aelis visiting again and Birdy sit together on Birdy’s
cloak talking and talking

AELIS
I am trying to picture him Does he
look much like the archangel

Michael

BIRDY
No dead saint could be as beautiful
as he

AELIS

I must see him for myself then

BIRDY
If I were to marry Aelis I should
choose him If only he were my
cousin and not my uncle true love
could prevail

(beat)

Aelis there’s a cottage raising
this afternoon

AELIS
Birdy you know we’d be whipped

BIRDY
You get whipped My father only
beats me across the hand

Birdy hugs Aelis

AELIS
Cottage-raising is not for girls
with suitors calling

EXT STONEBRIDGE VILLAGE- HILL- DAY

Half-hidden behind a wall Birdy watches the villagers in
silence

BIRDY (VO)
And so I watch the cottage-raising
from the hill Clean for my suitors
but full of dirty rage I shall
never smear myself with mud again
and shove Perkin into the ground
shall never get to see a hanging
shall never get to have anything
like fun and just because my
birthright is to bleed

I
I

EXT STONEBRIDGE VILLAGE- ALL HALLOWS’ EVE- NIGHT

It’s a full on EVENT The manor is abuzz with holiday spirit
as the town is filled with masked dancers and bonfires

The camera follows her in an epic shot as she walks through
the crowd-a guy in a devil costume chasing some giggling
kids Robert bobbing for apples from a bucket held by a
pretty milk maid

ROBERT
I hate this game What need have I
to catch an apple with my mouth

BIRDY
You are so pathetic

ROBERT
Shut up

She walks on smiling and laughing

BIRDY (VO)
Many people are afeared of All
Hallow’s Eve of the dead who come
back to visit the earth But the
only dead I know are my tiny
brothers and sisters who died
before they were born

Birdy walks alone past excited villagers in wild costumes
dressed as bears and tigers and ghouls She does not have an
elaborate costume except a unicorn horn sewn of burlap
fastened to her head with golden braid

BIRDY (VO)
And how could I be afeared of them
I wish they would come visit It
would ease my mother’s grieving

Birdy wanders the graveyard behind the house gently touching
the tiny tombstones of the lost children Margaret Edwin
William Rhys Rosemary Behind is the soundtrack of people
singing and cheering growling and playing drums

Her reverie is interrupted when she hears a voice calling to
her from over the fence

AELIS
Birdy Birdy

Birdy turns to see Aelis dressed in silk with her hair
covered by an ermine-lined hood

BIRDY
Aelis Do you like my horn

AELIS
It’s so lovely

BIRDY
Morwenna sewed it herself

AELIS
That’s so sweet

Behind Aelis Uncle George appears as her escort much to
Birdy’s surprise

BIRDY
George

GEORGE
Hello Bird that’s a nice looking
crown

BIRDY
It’s a horn

Off Birdy’s surprise

AELIS
I saw a man with gloves like
devil’s claws and became
frightened I was hiding behind the
hen house when this kind gentleman
found me

BIRDY

That is my Uncle George Aelis
AELIS

The one of whom you have so often

spoken
Birdy blushes

BELIS (CONTD)
Yes it must be he For you said he
was kind and handsome too A
saint

Aelis smiles George bows

GEORGE

I too was a bit shaken by that
clawed man- and the mummer with the
odd lump upon his face- was that a
costume or a terrible natural
affliction

(shaking his head)
We may never know In any case

(beat)
Let me get you both safely back to
your chambers

BIRDY
No George We won’t go home We
want to see all the mummers and the
dancing

They start to walk back to the manor each taking one of
George’s arms Perkin approaches covered head to toe in
flour

PERKIN
BOO

George lets out a little yell shocked by Perkin

BIRDY
Perkin

PERKIN
I am not Perkin I have died
Birdy And now I am just a ghost
sent to haunt you until the eeend
of your liiife I am the ghost of
Perkin

He starts to make ghost sounds

BIRDY
(stiffening)
I will have none of this silliness
goat boy

Perkin looks bruised

BIRDY (CONT’D)
(showing off for George)
I am simply trying to get back to
my chamber to read some lovely
verse before falling to peaceful
sleep and entering dream-land

Perkin is shocked and starts to back away

PERKIN
(cold)
I’1l leave you to your friends
then Lady Catherine

He runs off his limping gait exaggerated in the shadowy
darkness of the graveyard Guilt flashes across Birdy’s face
but she brushes it away trying to catch up with George and
Aelis

INT STONEBRIDGE MANOR- BIRDYS CHAMBER- NIGHT

Birdy and Aelis lie beside each other in bed their hair
spreading on the pillow Morwenna is asleep and snoring on
Birdy’s other side and serving maids sleep on a trundle bed
below

AELIS
My father has agreed that I might
stay for a fortnight or even two

BIRDY
(glumly )
I wish you had written to ask How
did you know it was convenient for
me I have a great many chores

Aelis looks bruised Birdy rolls away

BIRDY (VO)
Why am I being so unkind I feel
unsettled Was it the eel pie

EXT STONEBRIDGE MANOR- GARDENS- AFTERNOON

A marmalade cat is darting through the gardens Right behind
it is Birdy reaching for it desperately

BIRDY
Here crazy orange man Come with
me I have a lovely home for you

Coming around a corner Birdy reaches again for the cat
getting close but it escapes her grasp

When she looks up she sees Aelis and George partially
concealed by the trellised platform kissing passionately
This is no amateur kiss They are IN IT what we would call
in modern parlance HOOKING UP WHAT THE HECK

BIRDY (VO)
It is definitely not the eel pie

Aelis pulls back and George smiles dreamily into her eyes
lovesick and almost dorky with passion Aelis turns away
coyly (she’s good at this)

Birdy gasps and runs in the other direction They don’t
notice because they are loved up and horny so they won’t see
Birdy’s face crumple into tears and her first heartbreak
happen in real time

INT STONEBRIDGE MANOR- BIRDYS CHAMBER- MOMENTS LATER-
AFTERNOON

Birdy bursts through the doors weeping to find Morwenna and
her mother waiting for her with a bucket of bloody rags
Morwenna has a foreboding guilty look
AISLINN
Catherine your father has found
your monthly rags Stuffed inside
the privy They were peeking from
the cracks Bird

BIRDY
They were not mine

Morwenna stares at her apologetic

BIRDY (CONT’D)
(defeated)
How did you know

AISLINN

Catherine I am your mother and
the lady of this manor There is
naught I do not see and naught I do
not know It is useless to stuff
your rags no matter how deep

(beat)
I have tried to protect you as best
I can But your father has been
waiting for his chance to make you
a wife and to bring propriety to
this manor I can deny him no more

BIRDY
Do I not have a say

AISLINN
(understanding but firm)
Everything has its time its
season Birdy it is your season
my love

Birdy stares at both women the rage growing in her stomach
so her shoulders shake She takes a moment deciding who to

lambaste and settles on Morwenna

BIRDY
Traitor Liar Fiend

MORWENNA
Birdy

BIRDY

Devil Pauper Scum

AISLINN
Catherine stop

BIRDY
I hate you I HATE YOU

Birdy charges the full weight of her body at Morwenna who
can take it Morwenna fairly but firmly throws Birdy back on
the bed where she collapses weeping

MORWENNA
That is enough

The two adult women share a look as they exit The exterior
lock clicks shut and Birdy is alone trapped She sits at
her writing table and begins to scribble furiously

BIRDY (VO)

I have not a friend in the world I
have been cruel to Perkin Morwenna
has betrayed me Uncle George who
brought gaiety and wonder into my
life loves Aelis who is a weasel
And now my time is here I ripen
like a peach for plucking

She weeps more and more then stiffens with resolve looking
at her cage full of chirping birds Birdy opens her book of
Saints and places her head in her hands to think

INT STONEBRIDGE MANOR- BIRDY’S CHAMBER- DAY

A wooden bathtub is set up Morwenna bathes a cold and

distant quietly rageful Birdy in anticipation of her first
suitor

BIRDY (VO)
25th day of November I feel as
though no part of me is my own

MORWENNA
(clucking ignoring
Catherine’s icy demeanor)
Your father told me to scrub every
cranny of you before the guests
arrive

Birdy shivers in the cold bath water refusing to answer

BIRDY (VO)
Would I choose to die rather than
be forced to marry I do not think
either option appealing

(beat)
Nor fair

A beat Birdy dips her fingers in the black soap and makes a
stripe across her face Her eyes light up with an idea

head Then another A third poops down her hand as she passes
it to him and she wipes the shit across his garment

Birdy tries to put the cork back in but can’t She’s trying
all kinds of ways and has resorted to trying to sit on the
cork to get it into the bottle when the door creaks open- she
jumps back but it is MEG our dear dairymaid holding a large
ring of keys and a plate of bread and butter

BIRDY (CONTD)
Oh MEG

MEG
Shhh
(exaggerated whisper)
I have stolen the keys off a
sleeping Ferth the gate man Here
the heel of the bread and some
butter

BIRDY
Oh Meg I knew it You have always
been a rebel
(beat)
And a true friend Perhaps the only
one I have left in the world

MEG
Oh m’lady

BIRDY
(loudly)
Not m’lady Never m’lady

MEG
Alright m’lady
(catching herself)
I am sorry I am sorry

BIRDY
Birdy Just Birdy

INT STONEBRIDGE MANOR- GREAT HALL- MORNING

IT’S THE MOST WONDERFUL TIME OF THE YEAR We pan along the
mantle it is decorated with small fir trees and home-made
wreaths

Panning along the table What would once have been a massive
Christmas feast is now a single roast duck some loaves of
bread boiled eggs roast carrots and mashed beets Rollo’s
hound runs through frame

BIRDY (VO)
Christ’s day When I was young
father had a Golden Jesus that
pissed wine Now we just cut the
brown parts from the carrots

Aislinn adjusts the decorations and hangs glass ornaments
carefully according to Rollo’s instructions

ROLLO
We want the stars to really sparkle
as if the heavens have opened up
right here in the great hall so if
we can get them at an angle just
so

AISLINN
My love does this strike your
fancy

ROLLO
My angel when you see the light
hit the glass and twinkle you will
know

INT STONEBRIDGE MANOR- GREAT HALL- EVENING

A Christmas play is being mounted The townspeople have
worked for months on the show and Perkin can be seen as one
of the three wise men along with ALF and GERD fidgeting
with a straw beard tied under his chin MEG is the angel
Gabriel and someone else is dressed as a star

The LAUNDRESS not a virgin by any means her breasts
dangling is the Virgin Mary The cook is Joseph

COOK
Fear not I bring great news To
you a savior is born

LAUNDRESS
A child It cannot be for I am
just a simple young virgin

The audience roars with laughter Morwenna finds it intensely
hilarious

BIRDY
Why is it so funny

MORWENNA
She’s no more a virgin than I ama
princess

Birdy surreptitiously pulls her diary out and scribbles
IMPORTANT FIND OUT EXACTLY WHAT A VIRGIN MIGHT BE

As the angel Gabriel Meg sings a sweet song of blessing over
the couple and their baby It sounds lovely resounding
through the great hall

Rollo sits beside Aislinn Robert behind them and he sways
to the music transfixed He bobs along conducting a bit
with one finger utterly involved emotional even Birdy sees
a couple of PEASANT MEN watch him from a corner One nudges
the other and points at Rollo They laugh at his expression
of emotion one does a small impression

Birdy registers this and stiffens up oddly protective and
humiliated on his behalf She looks back to the stage

As Perkin helps to carry a large wreath of golden stars to
the manger Birdy tears up She smiles at Perkin clapping
just for him He sees her briefly

BIRDY (VO)
My eyes prick and water Perhaps I
am allergic to cheer After all a
diary is no substitute for a
friend

Perkin smiles for the first time in a while Birdy mouths

BIRDY
I’m sorry

He looks cross

BIRDY (CONT’D)
(Louder )
I am sorry

He shakes his head no

BIRDY (CONT’D)
(full volume)
Perkin I AM SORRY

He laughs out loud In his distracted excitement he does a
little happy dance for Birdy and lets go of his goat The
goat aggressively approaches the baby Jesus which is just a
little black dog in swaddling Seeing the other animal the
goat bolts Whining the little black dog follows Perkin
runs behind them dropping his staff with a clatter and his
beard falling to the ground still smiling and waving at a
happy Birdy

LAUNDRESS
(looking at empty stage)
Me best line was coming

INT STONEBRIDGE MANOR- GREAT HALL- AFTERNOON

Birdy and Aelis sit in their winter cloaks near a burning
fire doing their embroidery Cornethia watching them coolly
They whisper back and forth

AELIS
(whisper)
Will you be angry with me forever

BIRDY
(bitter whisper)
Perhaps I shall be Aelis

CORNETHIA
Ladies we learn best when we close
our mouths and open our ears

They pause then Aelis whispers more quietly yet more
urgently

AELIS
But I have done nothing wrong

Birdy ignores her focusing on her tangled embroidery

BIRDY
Except for stealing the man I loved
with all my heart And behind my
back no less To my mind you are
a deceitful coward

Aelis bursts into tears loud and intense Cornethia offers
the hem of her habit for Aelis to cry into

BIRDY (CONT’D)
Aelis please
(beat)
I disavow my terrible mouth She’s
a beast my mouth and she acted
without my consent

Birdy slaps herself across the face

BIRDY (CONT’D)
Bad Birdy Bad

Aelis grabs her hand stopping her
AELIS
Birdy I am to be married

BIRDY
(stricken)
To George

AELIS
No to a boy of only nine George
has to marry some horrid old widow
named Ethelfritha And now you will
not even be my friend

Aelis rushes out Birdy looks at the nun wearily

BIRDY (VO)
For the first time in my life I am
choking on my words My heart has
been shaved and boiled like a
parsnip George is to be married
George is to be married George
Is To Be Married

Birdy looks at the nun wearily
BIRDY
I suppose you’re not taking joiners
at the convent
CORNETHIA

BIRDY
Pity

INT STONEBRIDGE MANOR- BIRDYS CHAMBER- MORNING

Birdy wakes early opening the shutters dutifully and

struggling to put her dress on with care

BIRDY (VO)
6th day of January Twelve-ninety-
one is upon us I have seen the
consequences of my horrid
temperament friendlessness
boredom purgatory So I embrace a
new resolve I will try my best to
be a lady to act and speak as
beautifully as my mother does to
make my parents and god divinely

happy

MORWENNA
Let me help you Bird

BIRDY
I will dress myself I am a woman
now Stand back

She continues to struggle Morwenna watches amused

MORWENNA
It’s back to front

BIRDY
It’s not Is it

EXT STONEBRIDGE VILLAGE- DAY

Birdy passes the dreaded Robert who is drinking a mug of ale
and watching his horse be re-shod She kisses his cheek
sweetly He is confounded

BIRDY (VO)
Disobedience has gotten me nowhere

ROBERT
(sotto)
What in God’s name

EXT GARDEN- DAY

Birdy strolls through the garden in one of her better
dresses posed in a lady-like way that doesn’t suit her with
a badly- attempted fancy hairdo falling around her face She
is fanning herself with a small fan of her mother’s

BIRDY (VO)
And who can fight an inevitable
fate anyhow

She shivers against the winter air collapsing back into
regular Birdy posture but when a young male gardener passes
she stiffens up and starts again

BIRDY (VO)
I resisted marriage and was dealt
only pain If I embrace it mayhap
there is even pleasure

INT STONEBRIDGE MANOR- GREAT HALL- EVENING

Birdy sits beside FULK a grotty loser with a bowl cut who at
least has all his teeth His father FULK THE ELDER is
helping orchestrate it all

FULK THE ELDER
Lady Catherine do you enjoy
riding

BIRDY
(genuinely trying)
I do my lord

FULK THE ELDER
Perhaps you and my son might ride
together whilst we are here Will
your horses get along

BIRDY
My horse has a lovely and even
temperament Uh yours sir

As the adults talk Birdy and young Fulk start whispering
like the only two teenagers at a grownup party

FULK
Do you not hate having to dress up
for these meetings

TEXT ON SCREEN

Fulk the Younger

- Son of Fulk the Elder
offering

- plot of healthy farmland
- 6 hound puppies

- a sweaty handshake

BIRDY
(sign of relief)
Lord yes This dress is so tight I
can barely breathe Is yours tight

FULK
I suppose this ones not so bad

Rollo clinks a tin cup disrupting the teen convo

ROLLO
(oddly composed)
It is a tremendous occasion to have
you here Lord Fulk and Elder Fulk
(MORE )

ROLLO (CONTD)
Especially as we have just learned
the joyful news that my wife is
expecting

Aislinn smiles Birdy goes pale

ROBERT
This is tremendous

BIRDY
What did you say father

ROLLO
Catherine are you excited to
welcome your brother

BIRDY
But the midwife has said it may
bleed her out this time

AISLINN
Birdy not now

ROBERT
(hissed)
It’s not the time It’s never the
time

BIRDY
Are you trying to kill her Do you
want to prove yourself a man that
much It is going to die THEY ALL
DIE

AISLINN
You didn’t die

BIRDY
I didn’t die but the rest do

Birdy slams the table and leaves

ROLLO
(embarrassed)
Lord Fulk
(beat)
Other Fulk she must have come down
with a fever this eve a light pox
has been going ‘round Stonebridge

ELDER FULK
Pox We best depart

The Fulks stand to exit

ROBERT
It’s not a big pox

AISLINN
Only a small pox

EXT STONEBRIDGE MANOR- PRIVY- NIGHT

Birdy weeping rushes to the privy holding a candle to
light her way When she arrives Fulk the younger is waiting
as well holding his travel lantern aloft They look at each
other awkwardly like teenagers waiting for the bathroom at a
concert which they basically are

FULK
Hello

BIRDY
I despise you

FULK
(confused)
I thought we got on quite well
She bangs on the privy

ELDER FULK (0S)
Let me pass my meal in peace

Beat

BIRDY
I’1l leave you in peace

Birdy walks behind the back of the privy chucks her candle
at the straw rushes around the base and runs

EXT STONEBRIDGE MANOR- NIGHT

Birdy watches the privy burn as Lord Fulk and Elder Fulk
gallop away The light from the burning privy illuminates her
rage

BIRDY (VO)
My new leaf was short-lived But my
rebellion will be forever

The villagers run toward the burning privy with buckets of
water Rollo stands uselessly behind them shrieking

ROLLO
For the sake of all that is holy
run Help Do something

He turns to a peasant slopping water ineffectually on the
privy

ROLLO (CONT’D)
What are you trying to do baptize
it Drown it Are you familiar at
all with the element of fire
Famously the enemy of water It
needs to be EXTINGUISHED not
drooled upon like a gumming infant

Rollo sees the Fulks gallop away

ROLLO (CONT’D)
FULKS
(beat to peasants)
Why is that bucket so small

The villagers continue to battle the flames as the fire rages
on Birdy watches stone-faced

INT STONEBRIDGE MANOR- ALE CELLAR- NIGHT

Rollo shakes Birdy by the shoulders of her dress practically
lifting Birdy her off the ground in a rage She hides her
fear and lets her body go limp as he shakes

ROLLO
Do you not understand the danger
you have placed us in For once
Catherine you could attempt to set
an example for our tenants for our
villagers To show them what a lady
can be when she sets her heart to
it Perhaps you might try that
rather than bringing shame and
mockery upon our home

BIRDY
I am not a lady sir thus cannot

mimic one

ROLLO
Sit down

She does

ROLLO (CONT’D)
(angry close-talking)

When I was a year younger than you
I inherited a town in shambles My
father had gambled away every pane
of glass every brick every sack
of grain And I have used every
ounce of my cunning and strength to
bring prosperity back to
Stonebridge

BIRDY
Your cunning and strength sir

ROLLO
And other qualities yes

BIRDY
Is that why I saw the tapestries
going to auction The finest cups
being packed up and shipped away
because of your cunning and
strength

He is hot with rage as he pounds the wall hurting his hand

ROLLO
I your father I am your father
(beat soft)
And if I say you shall be married
then married you shall be

INT STONEBRIDGE MANOR- GREAT HALL- DAY

The servants deck the hall for a massive festivity- there are
floral garlands and wreathes with golden angels perched on
top of them It’s a level of opulence this home hasn’t seen
in seasons but the taste is too wild and feminine to be
Rollo’s Birdy sullenly watches the decorations go up
sulking and popping the halo off an angel

BIRDY (VO)
Fifth day of February George weds
today Some marry for love some
marry for money some for duty and
some like George seem not to know
why they marry

INT STONEBRIDGE MANOR- GREAT HALL- DAY

Birdy and her family watch George get married to ETHELFRITHA
a messy manic but beguiling woman in her early fifties

It is a Christian wedding and FATHER HUY the village priest
officiates In traditional fashion Father Huy meets the
couple at the door of the great hall The crowd follows
behind them forming a semi-circle around them

Pregnant Aislinn dabs her eyes emotional Rollo is less
moved Robert is basically picking his nose and inspecting
it and basically means literally

FATHER HUY
Does anyone present know any reason
why this man and woman should NOT
be joined in holy matrimony

Rollo lets out a cough Father Huy looks at him

FATHER HUY (CONT’D)
Since there are no objections will
you take this man to be your
husband

TEXT ON SCREEN

Ethelfritha Rose Splinter of Devon
- 48 years of age

- widow who whittles

- eats sugar with her fingers

- richer than my father

ETHELFRITHA
(looking around happily)
I I will

FATHER HUY
And will you take this woman to be
your wife

GEORGE
(tired)
I will

George pulls some gold coins from his pocket and places them
on Father Huy’s open liturgy book along with the ring which
Father Huy blesses under his breath George takes the rings
and touches it to Ethelfritha’s thumb

FATHER HUY
In nomine Patris

GEORGE
In nomine Patris

George touches it to her first finger
FATHER HUY
Et filli

GEORGE
Et filli

Goerge touches it to her second finger

FATHER HUY
Et spiritus sancti

GEORGE
Et spiritus sancti

And he places it on her third finger

FATHER HUY
Amen

GEORGE
Amen

As Father Huy blesses them Aislinn whispers to Birdy

AISLINN

Does your uncle not look dashing
Bird And I remember when he was
crawling about the floor in his

christening gown

Birdy sulks in her pew despite having a stunning new green
dress with ermine accents She looks for the very first
time like a rose-bitten WOMAN but her frown says otherwise

Aelis watches from a separate pew Her parents are bickering
over her head She tries to cover her weeping eyes with her
hood but there isn’t enough hood to do the job

LORD SIDEBOTTOM

You tell your daughter
She should get used to
a fine young man there
to grow up into a fine

BEATRICE

absently ahead and holding her hand

staring

- loves hide and seek naps and soft foods
- Aelis’s new husband

Birdy looks at Aelis then back at sad George She cannot
bear to watch any of this and darts out while her father is
taking a secret swig from a flask grinning absently

EXT STONEBRIDGE VILLAGE- NIGHT

Birdy walks the village It is cold and misty- warmth glows
from inside houses but she is all alone Her sombre
contemplation is interrupted when she steps on something
squishy

BIRDY
Corpus Bones Must my world always
be peppered with shit

A GUY of about eighteen who is pushing a wheelbarrow full of
leather mittens hears her

MITTEN SELLER
A mouth to shame a pirate

She notices (any of us would notice) that he is cute and she
bows her head gathering her bravery

BIRDY
I am endeavoring to find the best
curse of them all Is it Corpus
Bones God’s Thumbs Or just a
simple “Satan and all his minions”

MITTEN SELLER
I personally go in for “death by
frying pan”

Birdy giggles

BIRDY
You are selling mittens

MITTEN SELLER
It grows colder and colder and so I
travel from town to town looking
for people whose fingers shiver

BIRDY
I have not a coin to my own name
sir
(beat)
I am but a servant

Beat

MITTEN SELLER
A servant in fancy dress though
(beat)
If you have no funds then a kiss
will do

BIRDY
Death by frying pan
(beat)
I cannot kiss you sir for I
have never kissed anyone before I
would be beat with the rod

He laughs sweetly

MITTEN SELLER
Than can I kiss you and take all
the blame

He grins She looks down at the mass of mittens She takes a
step forward closes her eyes and waits He takes a long time
to lean in- wha feels like years- and she opens one eye as
she receives a kiss lightly on the lips Not too long but not
so short as to mean nothing

BIRDY (VO)
That was it That was what made
George and Aelis go so mad

He grins hands her the mittens and is off humming to
himself

BIRDY (VO)
Well He looks rather pleased with
himself

She shrugs slipping one mitten on to see if they fit

INT STONEBRIDGE MANOR- GREAT HALL- LATER- NIGHT

A group of women are dancing an ornate dance in a ring their
dresses contrasting shades of silk so that they resemble a
sort of Mondrian painting by way of Coachella

This is our modern unisex version of the Carole dance a
dance done at Medieval weddings We move through them to
Birdy at a long table playing with her new mittens

BIRDY (VO)
Might I really count that as my
first kiss

(MORE )

BIRDY (VO) (CONTD)
I suppose I would like to
especially if it’s the only one
Ill ever choose to have myself

Birdy is seated beside Ethelfritha who eats a fish clean off
the bones while keeping one hand linked through George’s arm
Birdy watches Ethelfritha with disdain- the food bits on her
cheek the frizz of her hair her wrinkled sleeves
Ethelfritha notices Birdy noticing her and leans over

ETHELFRITHA
I paid for the festivities out of
my own pocket you know

Birdy doesn’t speak

ETHELFRITHA (CONT’D)
That’s one thing husbands are good
for Well dead husbands anyway
It’s very convenient when they die
wealthier than when you wed them
though still rather sad I suppose

BIRDY
We haven’t had a party like this in
months

ETHELFRITHA
Oh dear

BIRDY

We have no money left unlike you
There’s so much food tonight that
I’ve lost my appetite

(beat)
Or maybe love just makes me ill

ETHELFRITHA
Who said anything of love

Birdy looks intrigued

ETHELFRITHA (CONT’D)
Do I believe your uncle George
loves me No I do not But he will
protect me as only a husband can
protect a wife I inherit his title
and I hear he’s good with a sword
And in turn he has land to call
his own something his family could
not provide despite their title It
is a perfect trade Plus he’s
gorgeous You know in a childish
way

BIRDY
But do you not want to love
somebody

ETHELFRITHA
I have other fish to fry

Uncle George is Rollo-style wasted and it’s sad to watch He
gets up and wanders down the table picking up bottles of
wine to check for remaining drops When he finds a half-full
bottle he chugs Birdy watches him

ETHELFRITHA (CONT’D)
(eerily tuned in)
You are lucky little bird for you
have wings But you must learn to
harness them not to flap all about
and crash to the floor

Birdy pauses and reflects on this Down the table Birdy
notices Aelis sitting with her nine year old husband

BIRDY
Might I excuse myself a moment
(beat)
Aunt Ethelfritha

ETHELFRITHA
But of course little Bird Just
don’t try and fly the coop

Birdy walks purposefully toward Aelis watching the adults
who are not acting very adult When she reaches her friend
she stops standing vulnerably straight

BIRDY
I wish you the same things you wish
for yourself

AELIS
(loud above the din)
What
BIRDY
(hesitant shy)
I I wish your happiness Aelis
I am so sorry that I ever said
otherwise
(quiet)

Since we quarreled I have only
missed you

(even quieter)
And now there is so much to tell
I hath only two words mitten man

A long agonizing beat Aelis considers then throws her arms
around Birdy The two girls rock in each other’s arms

BIRDY (CONT’D)
Ever since you moved away I have
been so lonely and unlucky

AELIS
And ever since I moved away I have
wondered why nobody is as funny as
my Bird

The nine year old smiles at them and interjects clueless

NINE YEAR OLD HUSBAND
Would you like to see my doll He
has a turnip for a head

BIRDY
No thank you

NINE YEAR OLD HUSBAND
(to himself)
How silly

BIRDY
Who are you

NINE YEAR OLD HUSBAND
Why I am her husband of course

The girls burst into hysterics as if they’re making fun of a
kid who is a few years behind them in school only it’s
Aelis’s husband

INT STONEBRIDGE MANOR- GREAT HALL- LATER- NIGHT

After the party is the after party The event is raging
everyone drunk on Ethelfritha’s rich lady wine

At their wedding seats Ethelfritha slides her head onto
George’s shoulder He chugs his wine She stares at him
pouring him some more He chugs that She giggles A beat

GEORGE
(drunk)
What do you want from me

ETHELFRITHA
What do you want for yourself

A truly disgusting MALE GUEST (SHAGGY BEARD) starts making
waves he’s a bearded troll-like nightmare belching
chasing serving maids with his tongue wagging giving a wet
willy to a girl who is tidying the flowers He notices
Robert’s lurcher dog which is excitable and jumping and he
delivers a swift kick to its gut The dog whimpers shocked
and wanders off Shaggy Beard stands on the table

SHAGGY BEARD
Quiet Silence

Then bends over and loudly FARTS

SHAGGY BEARD (CONT’D)
I’1l blow this shit-hole down I’m
the seventh richest man in
Yorkshire and I want to fornicate

He chases after female guests

BIRDY (VO)
Adults call me insolent but have
they ever met their own drunken
friends Bleh

EXT STONEBRIDGE MANOR- NIGHT

George and Ethelfritha ride off in a cart with colorful
ribbons hanging as the servants and peasants wave goodbye
from the road banging pots and pans Birdy watches waving
not so sad as she once seemed

MORWENNA
Do you not love a wedding with
every beat of your heart

BIRDY
(crinkling her nose)
I do not But how strange that I
should like the woman who has taken
George from us

MORWENNA
Life is quite a shock Bird

Ethelfritha smiles and pats his back utterly free an
example to Birdy and to them all George waves meekly then
vomits off the side of the cart

BIRDY (VO)
That vomit was yet another shock

INT STONEBRIDGE MANOR- GREAT HALL- MORNING

Birdy her hair in fresh plaits sits at breakfast across
from her father mother the maybe possibly not-so-
abominable Robert and that awful male guest The man
glares at Robert Robert glares back

ROLLO
Good morning little bird

She doesn’t respond

BIRDY (VO)
Perplexingly pleasant
(beat)
Why does this shaggy-bearded cretin
remain

The man chews a boiled egg bits hanging from his sagging jaw
and sparse hairs He must be a Medieval age aka a age 52

ROLLO
Lord Murgaw do you know that
Catherine spins the finest yarn in
Stonebridge

SHAGGY BEARD
I do not care much for fabrics No
I would dance in the nude if it
were not a sin

ROLLO
(confused)
And what is it you like to do my
Lord The bit where you follow an
animal using a sort of pointed
ahem

ROBERT
Arrow As in hunting

ROLLO
I know about hunting I was
thinking more along the lines of
when men use their bodies to er

ROBERT
Climb trees That’s one I’m
excellent at father

ROLLO
No

SHAGGY BEARD
I collect rare lizard skins and
play puzzles one piece a night
Moderation in every area except the
carnal

The guest stares at Birdy who is unaware of any tension
Rollo meanwhile is horrified

BIRDY
What’s carnal Car-nal It is a
funny word

ROLLO
A funny word That’s all

ROBERT
Something you should talk about
with mom she might know

INT STONEBRIDGE MANOR- SOLAR- DAY

Rollo relaxing in a throne-like chair It’s clear Birdy
despite all her spying has hardly ever entered this room and
regards it with a hushed reverie

BIRDY
Yes father

ROLLO
My beloved daughter My sweetest
girl My only raven-haired lass

BIRDY
Who do you speak of I am your
daughter God help me but hardly
beloved So who is it you address

Her father smiles

ROLLO
My lady of Lithgow Your bridegroom
awaits you and none of your tricks
will profit you this time You’ve
reached the end of the charade and
you will move forward and out

BIRDY
The guest The man they call Shaggy
Beard Is my betrothed

ROLLO
Be respectful Catherine- his name
is Lord John Murgaw the Eighth and
he is the last and blessedly most
wealthy suitor

Birdy gasps

ROLLO (CONT’D)
Is that all sounding satisfactory

Birdy tries to speak but can only stutter Unable to summon
words Birdy runs from the room and into the hall panting

BIRDY (VO)

He is not a man He is a mottled
troll and should live in a cave A
murderer does not deserve such
punishment It cannot it will
not be

INT STONEBRIDGE MANOR- GREAT HALL- AFTERNOON

The family is gathered around an elegant lunch spread with
Shaggy Beard present They are eating meat pie and courgettes
shaved into flowers- fancy foods for their fancy guest

Birdy eats in silence

BIRDY (VO)
Luckily I am most experienced at
outwitting suitors

She stares at her food glumly

ROLLO
So Catherine can be prone to fits
of silence Right my lady

AISLINN
(curt)
She speaks when she wishes and is a
great deal of fun most of the time

SHAGGY BEARD
I can only imagine how delightful
you were when your husband first
procured you Bold playful but
dutiful Exactly my sort of woman

Rollo laughs uncomfortably Aislinn winces- she will tolerate
this only because she has to

SHAGGY BEARD (CONT’D)
The only women I cannot abide by
criers and those with liver spots

Just then the cook brings out a large cooked pig with an
apple in its mouth

ROLLO
Ah the prize pig

AISLINN
Made with my good mother’s recipe

Birdy looks at it and after a beat of scheming

BIRDY (VO)
Oh criers I am an expert crier
since the day I was born

Birdy begins to wail and flail over the pig’s corpse

BIRDY
Nooo not Jiminy They’ve killed
Jiminy
(louder wailing)
THE ONLY FRIEND I HAD JIMINNNY
AND PIGS CANNOT GO TO HEAVEN

Rollo and Robert look shocked

ROBERT
(laughing confounded)
Who in Gods name is Jiminy

Shaggy Beard looks at Catherine

SHAGGY BEARD
(through bites of newly
cut meat)
So Catherine am I to believe the
pig was a good friend of yours

Birdy flashes him a demonic smile then oinks at him hoping
this display will do the job

SHAGGY BEARD (CONT’D)
(about the pig and Birdy)
Spicy I like it

EXT STONEBRIDGE FIELD- MORNING

Birdy wanders the high grass looking carefully for something
When she finds it she grins and scoops it into a tin mug

INT STONEBRIDGE MANOR- SOLAR - MORNING

In Rollo’s man cave where guests are put up Shaggy Beard is
being dressed by his MANSERVANT He is in his undergarments
coughing vociferously when there is a knock at the door

SHAGGY BEARD
Who goes there

BIRDY
(sweetly)
Tis I Lady Catherine

MANSERVANT
Ahhh Your sweet wench sir

SHAGGY BEARD
Do not call my sweet future wife a
wench you fool

MANSERVANT
So sorry sir I was simply I
was only I was just

Shaggy Beard laughs as if delighted to have put the fear of
god in the guy The manservant laughs too half relief and
half terror

The Manservant opens the door Birdy bows

SHAGGY BEARD
I was not expecting to reveal my
skivvies to you until our wedding
day

BIRDY
And why must we dabble in
formality m’lord when we all know
that very soon what’s mine is yours
and yours is mine

SHAGGY BEARD
(looking her up and down)
Indeed it is and indeed it will be

MANSERVANT
Indeed it is and--

SHAGGY BEARD
(sharply)
Too many bloody voices in this
room

MANSERVANT
Yes Mine being the problem

BIRDY
I hear your joints ache and so I
have prepared you a traditional
Stonebridge poultice

She extends the plate

BIRDY (CONT’D)
Simply cake it over your elbows and
knees and let it absorb beneath the
layers of your clothing and let it
soak into your bones

SHAGGY BEARD
You are even more considerate than
you are beautiful

BIRDY
Good day my Lords

SHAGGY BEARD
Good day my Lady

Birdy curtsies and exits

MANSERVANT
Considerate beautiful and she
curtsies The whole package

The Manservant picks up and smells Birdy’s poultice and
cannot hide his disgust

Ah my finest work yet I can taste
my freedom

EXT STONEBRIDGE FIELD- DAY

Birdy Perkin Gerd Alf and Meg do a medieval version of the
limbo Meg and Alf making eyes at each other hold a stick
as Gerd sings and Perkin attempts to shimmy under it

ALF
Don’t touch the devil’s toothpick

BIRDY (VO)

Perkin truly is my heart’s brother
and so we managed to resolve our
troubles with a good old fashioned
arm wrestle which I won fair and
square

Meg calls to Birdy to hold the other end of the stick and she
obliges

BIRDY
Meg

MEG
Yes Birdy

BIRDY
What really is a virgin

Meg laughs shyly and drops the stick mid-limbo causing
Gerd to fall on his ass As the boys all wrestle Meg
whispers the answer to Birdy We hear selected words his man-
sword push in and out smush done

BIRDY (CONT’D)
I thought a virgin was when God
made you pregnant

MEG
Oh no that was only that one
virgin

Birdy looks horrified

EXT STONEBRIDGE MANOR- HERB GARDEN- DAY

Birdy walks alone in one of the nice capes her parents had
made in order to make her seem like hot property She is
breathing the cool air in big gulps

BIRDY (VO)
That is what a virgin is I had no
idea what I was asking

She stops and closes her eyes trying to ignore her problems
when one comes up behind her Shaggy Beard

SHAGGY BEARD
Lady Catherine

He quickens his pace to catch her

SHAGGY BEARD (CONT’D)
(slowing)
Lady Catherine might I join you
(lowering his tone)
You are the reason that I stink of
shit

BIRDY
(smiling)
If the shoe fits

SHAGGY BEARD
You thought you could outsmart me
with tomfoolery right But what
you didn’t bargain for is that I
Like The Chase

Catherine looks confused and scared as Shaggy Beard leans in

SHAGGY BEARD (CONT’D)
Tomorrow I shall give your father
the marriage purse a large sum of
gold for him But this is for you

He hands her a pouch of silver coins

SHAGGY BEARD (CONTD)
And when you spend that first piece
of silver on something pretty
remember that it is you finally
saying yes to me

Birdy totally without recourse pops Shaggy Beard in the
nose and runs

BIRDY (VO)
He will not be able to marry me for
I will not spend the coins just
angrily hoard them

He touches his smarting nose- a thin trickle of blood- and
grins He’s got a feisty one on the line

EXT STONEBRIDGE MANOR- DAY

Birdy is running her fancy cape flapping the camera close
on her face and pulling her Rollo and Robert follow
shouting They all run the same way their limbs flailing
more related than they want to be Birdy pauses catches her
breath her eyes fiery with angry disbelief Eyeing her
father Birdy simply holds her hands out asking for her
palms to be whipped But instead Rollo just stands there

BIRDY
Why don’t you whack me That’s what
youd really like is it not

Rollo is shocked- he hates hearing this from his daughter
Does she not understand that he punishes her to make her a
more successful member of society

ROLLO
Put your hands behind your back
Stand up straight
(cold)
You must pack your things at once
The lord has officially proposed

ROBERT
You need to leave here

BIRDY
No

ROLLO
Yes

BIRDY

No No No

ROLLO
YES Birdy I cannot play these
games I am tired I AM TIRED

ROBERT
Respect your father

BIRDY
(begging)
Please Just let me stay to meet
the baby

ROLLO
The baby does not come for months
yet

BIRDY
Please
(she is weeping)
I just want to meet the baby I
must meet the baby I have to meet
the baby

A beat
ROLLO
Fine I will tell Lord Lithgow you
are finishing lessons in keeping

the home But the moment-

ROBERT
The moment

Rollo pushes Robert’s head away Enough
ROLLO
The moment the babe is here then

you are not

The men walk away as if they haven’t just ruined her life

EXT STONEBRIDGE FIELD- AFTERNOON
Birdy flees up the hill where Perkin is tending his goats

BIRDY
Perkin PERKIN

He turns to her
PERKIN
Birdy Why are you wailing so Are

you possessed by a demon

She grabs him around the neck weeping He’s taken aback by
the rough physical affection and pats her awkwardly

BIRDY
Perkin We must marry

PERKIN
Youd make a sorry bride in this
state Birdy

Birdy pulls away her mind racing with plans

BIRDY
All we have to do is get married
tomorrow in the village and only
Morwenna and Meg and the pigs have
to be there I shall be Lady Perkin
and your goats shall be our
children--

PERKIN
Birdy Birdy stop I do not want
to marry you

BIRDY
You have to marry me My life hangs
in the balance and you refuse me

PERKIN
And what of my life Birdy My
plans Have you ever asked what I
dream of when I lay my head down at
night No

BIRDY
If I was fair of face like Aelis
youd marry me

PERKIN
No Birdy It’s not about being
fair-faced

BIRDY
What’s it about then

PERKIN
I don’t know I just don’t want to
Marry you or Aelis or Meg or
Morwenna or any other woman God has
or shall put on this earth

BIRDY
What would you marry a MAN
instead

Perkin looks stunned She has taken him by such surprise that
his ability to hide the truth is rendered obsolete It’s
clear on his face that yes what she’s said is true Ina
profound and nameless way Birdy understands

She hurls herself at Perkin and hugs him tight After a
moment of resistance he hugs back They cling to each other
desperately each caught in their own tiny hell Birdy
cradles his face

BIRDY (CONT’D)
We must run away Perkin Run
faraway and never comeback

PERKIN
Oh Birdy That is always your
answer Do you not see You would
like to ride into the crusades but
you are a lady I would like to be
a great scholar yet I cannot even
read We do not get to choose what
we do Life does not care about us-
we are given our stations until
death

This is too much for Birdy and she collapses panting Perkin
sits down beside her laying a hand on her back and begins
to sing- the same song as earlier but much sweeter now cozy
PERKIN (CONT’D)

Through the buckle till the pin

Holds the belt-end safely in
EXT STONEBRIDGE VILLAGE- DAY- A MONTAGE OF SPRING
Moving through springtime The sheep have given birth They
nurse the babies shaking their butts while they drink up
EXT STONEBRIDGE VILLAGE- DAY

Village women shake out their sheets and beat their rugs

EXT STONEBRIDGE FIELD- STREAM- DAY

The stream meanders on

INT STONEBRIDGE MANOR- AISLINNS CHAMBER- AFTERNOON

Birdy lays on the bed with her mother heavily pregnant once
more Aislinn lifts her night dress to reveal her naked
stomach and the side of her thigh and Birdy places a hand on
it

BIRDY
Mother She kicks like a pony

AISLINN
She

BIRDY
(shy)
I might like a sister Edward and
Robert all have each other I am
quite alone

AISLINN

(dropping her dress

again)
I should like that too Little
Bird But would she be as perfect
as my first-born daughter You are
as naughty as God hoped you might
be

Birdy runs her finger along the scar on her mother’s neck

BIRDY
Mother why does the skin on your
neck bulge like a rope

AISLINN
That’s what happens when you touch
fire Birdy

BIRDY
Did you touch fire Mumma

AISLINN

No Bird Fire touched me

(beat)
It’s why I tell you to obey I was
once willful too and my father
showed me how he felt about that
with the iron And so when you try
so hard to bend the ways of the
world Bird I cheer for you but I
also fear for you To see you
hurt I could not sustain that
Birdy I would rather see you
settle than be seared

(beat)
There are worse fathers than yours
Bird
BIRDY

But what of husbands mother What
of the man I am meant to marry
mother

AISLINN
(strained)
I believe that you will be
protected that he will see the
goodness in your eyes and it will
bring out the goodness in his I
must believe that

A knock at the door

AISLINN (CONT’D)
Enter

Robert peeks his head around the door uncharacteristically
shy

ROBERT
Mumma I require your council

He spies Birdy

ROBERT (CONT’D)
(cold)
But I will wait until your bed is
free of fleas

AISLINN
Children please Let us leave
behind childhood teasing and act a
family while we still can It does
my heart a great deal of good

Robert enters--this is a different kid than we’ve seen
before He’s sheepish almost embarrassed with a sweet hope
brimming around the edges He’s clutching a slip of
parchment

ROBERT
We have had word from
Gloucestershire

AISLINN
Gloucestershire

BIRDY
Aelis

ROBERT
Indeed

(he reads blankly)
The child husband is dead Fever
Oh little Bird everyone cries but
I cry with joy for I am coming
home

BIRDY
The message was for me Hand me my
letter

Birdy prepares for a fight but Robert simply hands it over

AISLINN
Life can be very cruel my loves

Beat
BIRDY

Do you think they buried his turnip
head doll beside him

AISLINN
(clucking)
Birdyyy
ROBERT

Mother might I

AISLINN
You did well to never lose hope
that you might have your own love
chick-a-loo

Birdy looks at Robert who wants to die “Chick-a-loo” What
goes on between these two when she’s not around

BIRDY
(crossly)
What is going on here I do not
like to be on the wrong end of
secrets Mumma

Aislinn looks to Robert for approval He nods
AISLINN

Birdy your brother has long
harbored hopes of proposing to

Aelis

BIRDY
Robert Aelis That Robert My
Aelis

ROBERT

No She is everyone’s Aelis like

Jesus or springtime and she brings

the world just as much sacred joy
(MORE )

ROBERT (CONT’D)
And if she would have me I would
consider myself a man reformed
reborn and blessed by a God whose
existence I could not deny

Aislinn smiles Even Birdy is moved Wow Robert

BIRDY (VO)
Well I guess I don’t know
everything I think by sneaking and
spying I can avoid surprises but
they come anyway sometimes in
the form of unexpected love

EXT STONEBRIDGE COUNTRY ROAD- DAY

In her new lilac dress Birdy is bouncing along dirt roads in
a wooden carriage Birdy looks at the driver’s strong back
his handsome neck the wind ruffling his hair

BIRDY (VO)

It is a good day for I head to
Aelis’s and we can rejoice in the
news that we are now and finally
sisters I bring a welcome to the
family gift of preserves from the
kitchen and a comb for her hair

(beat)
I once caught Morwenna staring at
this driver while he washed blood
from a boil on his thigh She calls
him Golden Tiger when she speaks of
him in secret Imagine life with a
peasant So simple So passionate
So

He turns to her to check on her smiling to reveal absolutely
zero teeth

BIRDY (VO)
Toothless

EXT AELIS’S ROAD- AFTERNOON

The carriage lurches to a stop waking Birdy Birdy notices
that Aelis’s family is waiting for her by the road and they
bum-rush the carriage Aelis stands between her baleful
father and step mum Lord Sidebottom wears some of his old
chain mail and it clanks as his push chair moves

AELIS
Birdy
BIRDY
Aelis

Birdy jumps out of the carriage and races to Aelis

BIRDY (CONT’D)
Whatever is the emergency Aelis
Why are you all standing in the
road like cattle

AELIS
(scared)
Hello Bird

As Aelis hugs Birdy she bursts into tears

BIRDY
Aelis what is the matter It is a
happy day You’re to be married We
are to be sisters

LORD SIDEBOTTOM
Young Catherine I am glad to see
you Please tell your drunk of a
father that his offer is offensive

BERENICE
(to her husband)
She is not one of your special
hunting dogs the ones you pay for
in gold brick She is a girl Just
as I once was

LORD SIDEBOTTOM
Shut up shut up shut up Berenice
I grow so tired of your voice

BERENICE
And I grew weary of yours the
moment I heard it Good thing you
don’t have long to live

AELIS
Can everyone please stop shouting

GOLDEN TIGER
There do seem to be a lot of raised
voices I always say speak like
butter not like knives

LORD SIDEBOTTOM
AND WHOMST ARE YOU My daughter is
a virgin confirmed by exam

(MORE)

LORD SIDEBOTTOM (CONT’D)
She can command more than twice
the pitiful marriage purse your
father proposes

BIRDY
They pay more for virgins
(nobody hears her)
Aelis They pay more for
virgins

She looks at Aelis awash in tears
She feels the bag of silver at her side
She backs slowly away

BIRDY (CONT’D)
You men are not God You don’t get
to decide who we are where we go
or how much we cost We aren’t
things we are people We can think
and we can hear and we can feel
and you just broke my best friend’s
heart because of your greed

LORD SIDEBOTTOM
Insolent whelp What difference
does that make A girl’s master
merely changes from her father to
husband

Birdy looks at Aelis as if to say “I love you I’m sorry”
She hops back in the cart and taps Golden Tiger on the
shoulder hard

BIRDY
Can we move

GOLDEN TIGER
But where m’lady

BIRDY
Rutherford

The wind whips Birdy’s hair as she stews
BIRDY (VO)
I’m sorry Aelis I want to save you

more than anything I do

AELIS
Birdy

LORD SIDEBOTTOM
(to Aelis)
You Get inside and straight to
your room

BIRDY (VO)
I am all out of tricks it seems
Well all but one

EXT HANGING TOWN- AFTERNOON

Birdy wanders into a town bigger than her village
overwhelming her senses The streets are bustling- sellers
with food stalls and men welding steel Birdy is dressed in
baggy peasant’s clothing stolen from Golden Tiger

BIRDY (VO)
I convinced Golden Tiger to give me
his clothes so I can run to the
only place I think they might see
me as more than a shiny gold coin

EXT ROAD- SAME TIME- AFTERNOON

Golden Tiger sits wearing Birdy’s cape with her dress draped
across his lap showing too much flesh

EXT GEORGE AND ETHELFRITHA’S MANOR- NIGHT

Ragged and exhausted Birdy approaches a house in the woods
and staggers toward the door

BIRDY (VO)
Uncle George is a hero and perhaps
he can tell me how to be one
myself Not just in fantasies But
in real life

She raps at the door using a large welded knocker It
thunders through an empty-sounding house She waits The door
finally rumbles open revealing her uncle George He is tired
and drunk bloated and sad Our Golden George is a thing of
the past

GEORGE
(coldly)
We have nothing for you peasant
boy
BIRDY

No Uncle George

Birdy removes her hat

BIRDY (CONT’D)
It is I Catherine

GEORGE
Bird

She hugs her uncle around the waist

INT GEORGE AND ETHELFRITHA’S MANOR- SOLAR- NIGHT

Birdy sits across from George and Ethelfritha wrapped in
blankets and cozy A fire roars George and Ethelfritha wear
their matching sleep outfits- George looks dashing but
distracted a little lifeless in his silk robe Birdy is
eating an orange from an ornate dish

ETHELFRITHA
Delicious no I had my first
orange upon my father’s return from
the Moorish country

BIRDY
I should like to go to the Moorish
country

GEORGE

I had bet you would I should think
youd like to go anywhere your
father isn’t

BIRDY
We have a baby due any day you
know My father wants a boy but we
secretly hope for a girl
(beat)
And I am to marry Shaggy Beard

GEORGE
(stunned)
Of Lithgow

BIRDY
It is he

GEORGE
Oh Birdy I knew it would be
someone of note but not that sort
of note
(beat empathy lessening)
Lord Murgaw keeps a fine house and
he will keep you well

ETHELFRITHA
He owns three small towns and a
leper colony- perhaps you can keep
an arboretum in the back there
behind it George himself has
started a garden of plants beloved
by Christ

GEORGE

It is barely a garden my love but
a place to smoke my pipe in peace
Thus far only the crows seem
impressed by my green thumb

ETHELFRITHA
(proudly)
Crows adore George They find him
soothing
Beat
GEORGE

This tea has soothed me my
darling and so I must retire

BIRDY
(confused)
But I have just arrived

GEORGE
I tire easily these days I am not
young
(sad smile)
My back stoops and my stomach
bloats In the morning I will
deliver you back to Stonebridge

Birdy stares at her uncle who was also her first love

BIRDY
Uncle George please tuck me in

He stares at her- despite the ways he’s changed her face
still tugs at his heart strings
INT GEORGE AND ETHELFRITHA’S MANOR- GUEST CHAMBER - NIGHT

George pulls back the covers on a bed in a richly decorated
room and Birdy scrambles in

GEORGE
Alright blow out the candle
BIRDY
No will you tell me a story

George sighs sitting down in the rocking chair beside
bed

GEORGE
I don’t think I know any stories

BIRDY
You No stories But you have been
around the world You have seen the
ocean

GEORGE

But I did not keep a little book
like you do And so the memories
have slipped through my hands like
snow when I try and take them home

(beat)
I remember very little about very
little

Beat

BIRDY
Uncle George

GEORGE
Yes Bird

BIRDY
If you are a hero then why did you
not try and save me

GEORGE
Save you

BIRDY
From my father From Shaggy Beard
From my future

GEORGE
But you see Bird I am not a hero
(beat)
Can you ever forgive me my sweet
girl
BIRDY

You are right Uncle George- heroes
are just in storybooks Even the
saints only escaped by dying

the

GEORGE
And that does not sound like much
of an answer either

BIRDY
Do you love Ethelfritha

GEORGE
As best I know how

BIRDY
Do you love
(beat)
Me

GEORGE
(smiling a flash of his
old self)
Desperately

INT GEORGE AND ETHELFRITHAS MANOR- GUEST CHAMBER- MORNING

Birdy sleeps the candle burnt down to a nub and George
snores lightly in the rocking chair beside her Ethelfritha
still in fantastic pajamas busts in and shakes Birdy She
awakens with a start

BIRDY
Ah

ETHELFRITHA
Shhh Hurry We must go and feed
the owls

EXT GEORGE AND ETHELFRITHA’S MANOR- GARDEN- MORNING

Birdy follows Ethelfritha to a large wooden habitat in the
back yard Between metal bars she sees only sticks and
leaves

BIRDY
There is nothing inside

ETHELFRITHA
Just you wait little bird

Ethelfritha pulls a dead white mouse from her pocket and
hurls it through the bars The owls swoop and one catches it
They return to their bars hoo-hooing and staring with their
big eyes Birdy looks on in awe
BIRDY
I keep birds but mine are very
small

ETHELFRITHA
These are more than birds They are
creatures I’m a creature too you
know
(beat)
Shaggy Beard eh

BIRDY
It is not fair

ETHELFRITHA
Youre right Birdy It is not
fair You should not have to marry
him

BIRDY
I should not

ETHELFRITHA
Or have to be a lady

BIRDY
I hate being a lady

ETHELFRITHA
(leaning in
conspiratorially)
Then let us run away

BIRDY
Us

ETHELFRITHA
Why not I am rich and you are
young Together we have it all We
can make our way to Arabia and
taste the orange straight from the
tree Have you ever met a lion

Birdy is finding her aunt more and more manic and also
starting to consider the reality of the situation

BIRDY
(hesitant)
No

ETHELFRITHA
A sultan Would you like to slay a
sultan and steal his gold Yes

Beat

BIRDY
Yes I would But I would miss
Morwenna my nurse

ETHELFRITHA
Silly girl you are too old for a
nurse

BIRDY
And Perkin He is my dearest
friend

ETHELFRITHA
You need no friends when you have
adventure

BIRDY

At least if I am in Lithgow I can
visit home I can sleep in my bed
at Christmas check on my mother
(beat)
If we went on a big adventure I
could never reunite with Aelis
And I would never see the baby
grow And they would miss me They
would miss me Birdy

Ethelfritha smiles Birdy gets it They are divinely trapped
in their lives and sometimes it is not a curse but a comfort

EXT STONEBRIDGE MANOR- LATE MORNING

Birdy looks out at her home with a new fondness Her arms are
wrapped around George’s waist as they gallop home on his
white horse

George hops off the horse and helps his niece down catching
her in a hug as she slides off the saddle For a moment he
can protect her Then he lets go

BIRDY
Uncle George

GEORGE
Yes Bird

BIRDY
(real advice)
Next time a peasant boy raps on
your door please give him a scrap
of something to eat

GEORGE
Bye Birdy

They hug deeply

BIRDY
Bye Uncle George

Morwenna rushes to the door angry and frazzled

MORWENNA
Birdy You pest you rat you-
(beat)
We were so afraid Golden Tiger
arrived late last night in your
cape CRYING

She hugs Birdy tight crying into the front of her dress
Birdy kisses Morwenna all over the face kissing her tears
The love between them is apparent and for a moment free of
the push pull we’ve come to know

BIRDY
Do not weep Morwenna When you do
you puff up and resemble a roast
beef

MORWENNA
My Bird it’s your mother

INT STONEBRIDGE MANOR- AISLINNS CHAMBER- DAY

Aislinn is in the midst of a painful and terrifying labor on
her knees on her bed holding two ropes tied to the bed post
Her chambermaid concerned supports her on one side while
NAN the midwife is between her legs from behind This isn’t
pretty TV labor- it is grim and real the sheets soaked with
sweat and dotted with blood

NAN
Push more still Lady Aislinn
Gather your strength yet

Aislinn screams Birdy runs to the head of the bed

BIRDY
It is me mother

AISLINN
Urrrggghhh Gahhhh

Her eyes roll back in her head

BIRDY
Your Birdy Your only one I am
back Mumma

Morwenna is pulling at Birdy

MORWENNA
Leave her be Bird She can’t hear
you right now

BIRDY
I will always be the person you
want me to be Mumma I promise

Aislinn lets out a long wild scream

NAN
A crown

Nan looks closely

NAN (CONT’D)
Stuck The skull too big to pass

The door opens and the priest FATHER HUY enters A few
servant girls scatter

NAN (CONT’D)
(whispering)
There is nothing to be done You
must baptize father Now Bless
them both

The priest begins Birdy watches in horror

FATHER HUY
Our father who art in heaven
hallowed by thy name your kingdom
come your will be done on earth
as in heaven

AISLINN
Stop it I can do it

FATHER HUY
Lead us not into temptation--

Just then Rollo enters screaming

ROLLO
Did I hear that you are giving up
NAN
Lord Rollo we have tried all there
is to try The babe’s head is stuck
deep within her hips

FATHER HUY
We baptize the baby in the name of
the Holy Father

Rollo grabs the priest by the neck

ROLLO
Doubters Doubters all of you My
holy wife will not fail to do this
My holy child will not fail to
live

He hurries from the room bellowing nonsense then moves
close to the terrified Nan

ROLLO (CONT’D)
You midwife will stay You will
stay and you will not sleep until
the child is delivered forth
safely I will not lose another
child and I will not lose my only
wife Do you hear me DO YOU HEAR
ME

NAN
(whispered)
Yes m’lord

ROLLO
(to the Priest)
Thank you we do not need you Get
out and don’t come back

Nan looks at the cook

NAN
Go get some more boiling water and
rags and some butter too

Rollo kneels at his wife’s side

ROLLO
My darling My brave beautiful
darling who is all I need and all
I hold sacred You were born for
this You are strong So strong

AISLINN
Rollo my love If this is to be
it is to be But if it is not and
I am not then all I ask is you
make sure our children find their
place in this world Not just any
place Their place Do you Can
you

Her lip trembles Her hands loosen on the ropes a bit

ROLLO

No

(tears in his eyes

gentle smile)
No Look at me All that I am is
us All that I can be you already
are You are so good so wise so
powerful So spritely in the
morning and so grumpy if you’re
denied a nap So happy when the
first flowers bloom and so pitiful
when it rains So good to our
children and so intolerant of
fools but too polite to show it
So close to God while barely ever
uttering his name I want to make
you laugh and to make you safe and
I will not live in a world where
our children’s children do not have
the chance to hear you laugh as you
watch them tumble on our grass

(beat)
Can you try Will you try

A soft loving beat as they gaze into each other’s eyes

ROLLO (CONT’D)
(to Nan)
Do not stand idle Get the doctor
Get two doctors Get three
(to Aislinn)
You are so strong

EXT STONEBRIDGE VILLAGE- MORNING

The town is misty and solemn A few farmers are afoot but
they move slowly in the heavy air

INT STONEBRIDGE MANOR- GREAT HALL- MORNING

The servants change out the dirty rushes and open the leather
window flaps letting the air and light in

INT STONEBRIDGE MANOR- AISLINNS CHAMBER- MORNING
Close up An empty cradle dressed in white lace
Close up Aislinn and Rollo’s empty bed

Sat in a rocking chair by the window Aislinn- pale but
mighty- breastfeeds a tiny naked baby

BIRDY (VO)
Our baby was born last evening a
dear beautiful scrawny little girl

We widen out to find a second baby in Rollo’s arms

BIRDY (VO)
In fact two of them

Birdy enters the frame and dangles a gold tassel on one
baby’s head kissing the other Aislinn laughs

BIRDY (VO)
My father for all his bellowing
about sons is floating on air
Which brings me to the strangest
words I have ever said thank you
to my father the most unlikely
agent of a miracle that I know

INT STONEBRIDGE MANOR- BIRDY’S CHAMBER- NIGHT

Birdy writes at her desk the cradle beside her- the babies
sleeping peacefully head to toe inside it Birdy rocks the
cradle with one lazy ecstatic arm She smiles at the babies
who slumber in linen swaddling

BIRDY (VO)
We will call them Eleanor and Mary
Catherine proper yet lovely I
wish I had more time to teach them
tricks

EXT STONEBRIDGE FIELD- DAY

Birdy lies in the tall grass taking in her surroundings She
spies Meg and Alf walking further down the hill holding
hands and engaged in private sweet conversation Meg carries
a rough but charming bouquet of flowers a gift from Alf

BIRDY (VO)

Tenth day of June I feel something
changed inside of me Just because
I cannot be happy does not mean
that I do not wish happiness for
others Joy is infectious I am
learning I want to save Aelis and
I think I know a way even if it
means sacrifice

INT STONEBRIDGE MANOR- SOLAR- DAY

Birdy is talking with her drunken father and Robert but this
time it’s not a fight We barely hear them as we exist in
Birdy’s roaring mind as she makes this decision She holds
the velvet bag of coins out and knowing she’s sealed her
fate to Shaggy Beard dumps them The sound of clattering
coins brings us into the present Robert starts gathering and
counting the coins

ROBERT
Is it coins

BIRDY
Yes Shaggy Beard’s

ROBERT
For me Is it enough father Is
1t

BIRDY

Yes you fool I counted it
Rollo is shocked

ROLLO
Wonderful I can buy my tiger back

They both stare at him incredulously
ROLLO (CONT’D)

Robert I am jesting We will plan
a wedding forthwith

ROBERT
(in disbelief)
Well this means I am a husband

ROLLO
Not yet
ROBERT
(to Birdy)

This is really nice The first nice
thing you have done for me
Fantastic

Robert begins to jump up and down like a teenage girl does a
happy dance and happy dances out of the room

Rollo looks at his daughter understanding her deep and
inherent goodness She is a remarkable woman despite him

Unsure of how to express this he grabs her shoulders tight
and almost vibrating with love shakes her She nods at him
as if to say “yes sir”

BIRDY (VO)

This was as much for Aelis as it
was for my brother likely more
She is safe now I may not be safe
with her but I do know she will
walk my grounds sleep in my
quarters watch out for Perkin and
feel something like love

EXT STONEBRIDGE MANOR- DAY
Aelis and Robert dance at Aelis’s wedding staring into each
other’s eyes Aelis looks like Lily Collins at the Oscars
only 14 and anaemic
BIRDY (VO)

We are having a wedding for my

Aelis and her Robert It may be the

last time I ever celebrate so I

better enjoy it

The field is full of the people who love them and the ones
they love

Birdy’s whole family
Perkin in his finest coat (which has a rip at the seam)

Morwenna with her breasts hiked high in a royal blue gown

Meg and Alf kiss and cuddle their hands entwined with
wedding rings on Meanwhile the Baker tenderly hand-feeds
Berenice bites of fancy cakes and pastries from a platter
They kiss without shame as Lord Sidebottom grumbles in a push
chair

As Robert and Aelis’s dance ends Aelis reaches for Birdy and
together they dance a merry jig whirling and twirling no
longer girls though not exactly women either

We see Rollo dancing while Aislinn watches and smiles- he
dances much like his daughter delicate free and joyous He
bows to his son who bows back

They dance on the moves all their own

Rollo looks as cheerful as he can Aislinn stares at him as a
single tear falls from his eye despite his lips being

stretched into a smile

AISLINN
Oh Rollo

She whispers something to him His face contorts in pain
BIRDY (VO)

One more night in my own bed
then Shaggy Beard

EXT STONEBRIDGE MANOR- MORNING

The bells on Aelis’s toes become the church bells ringing on
a rainy morning The family- Aislinn the babies Eleanor and
Mary Catherine Rollo Robert Aelis- form a goodbye line for
Birdy who is stepping into a cart

Aislinn smiles pained and holds the babies up

Aelis tears up and Robert comforts her

Perkin stands with his goats waggling a little finger
awkwardly

BIRDY (VO)
Do not cry Do not cry

Birdy steps past the group and through the gatehouse They
wave

PERKINS
Goodbye Birdy

MORWENNA
We love you Birdy

MEG
Birdy

Meg breaks through the crowd running in her dirty skirt and
gives Birdy a quick kiss on the cheek She turns to run back
to the servants but Birdy clutches her hugging her as hard
as she wants to hug all the others panting into her hair
Meg lets out a little cry After a beat she lets go and Meg
retreats

Before she turns onto the road Birdy looks back at her
family and- despite her clear pain and desperation- sticks
her tongue out It’s a tiny gesture brave and playful and
a teary-eyed Rollo takes it in

AISLINN
(whispered to Rollo)
Sometimes as the man of the house
you have to make very hard
decisions

Birdy enters the carriage waiting beyond the gatehouse
entrance

INT CARRIAGE- SAME TIME- MORNING

As Birdy enters she makes eye contact with the waiting Shaggy
Beard who smiles tightly with his mouth though not his eyes
his hands folded around a handkerchief in his lap He blows
his nose She doesn’t smile back but she is placid resigned
to her fate

SHAGGY BEARD
My yearly hay fever has come about-
I trust you know how to prepare a
proper cordial for your lord

The carriage takes off for Shaggy Beard’s castle As they
ride he chats on and on his dialogue dulling to an abstract
drone in Birdy’s ears

SHAGGY BEARD (CONT’D)
My health has never that of a man
in his prime but I have always
dealt with it by being pure of
habit and maintaining a stolid
countenance a regular schedule of
cool baths and requiring that the
servants dust daily under the
wardrobe to rid the space of
impurities

Then a shout “BIRDY” Someone is calling “CATHERINE
BIRDY” Her father catches up with the carriage jumping and
pounding the side

ROLLO
Stop Stop Stop

It finally draws to a stop

SHAGGY BEARD
My lord

ROLLO
My lord indeed
(panting)
Good sir We have changed our
minds

SHAGGY BEARD
Excuse me my lord I seem not to
have heard you for my allergies--

ROLLO
Weve changed our bloody minds The
girl remains with us

Birdy looks at her father in shock

ROLLO (CONT’D)

For the time being

(beat)
Frankly sir I would burn in hell
for allowing my daughter to accept
a proposal from such a rank and
uniformly uncompelling man She
will die of boredom and
furthermore you resemble a bear
who has attempted union with our
local locksmith It cannot be
Birdy is
from the
roaches
mud and

utterly flummoxed- could this be real Is it a hoax
man who has always treated her like she’s made of
Shaggy Beard departs the carriage careful of the
stands in the road with Rollo

ROLLO (CONT’D)
Birdy out of the carriage

She starts to follow but is sharply stopped

SHAGGY BEARD
(terrifying tone)
Stay My lady stay

She watches from the window of the carriage

Beat

SHAGGY BEARD (CONTD)
Well you’ve spent my money I gave
for her dowry so I do not see what
we have to discuss

ROLLO
The fact is sir I am walking back
that path with my own daughter
under my own arm

SHAGGY BEARD
If you want Lady Catherine we will
duel

ROLLO
Alright Yes of course A duel
That does seem fair May I just
take a moment to Fine yes I
see

BIRDY (VO)
I am to believe that my father
plans to fight this man swordplay
being a skill he does not possess
in order to keep me his greatest
pest from having to marry

ROLLO
Robert Collect my sword and
accoutrements For we are to
(beat)
DUEL

SHAGGY BEARD
Etienne My sword

Up by the gatehouse Robert announces it to those around him
eyes lit up with excitement

ROBERT
We are having a DUEL

The town rings out with people shouting DUEL DUEL

ROLLO
So duel to the death or what

SHAGGY BEARD
Aye But if by my sword you do not
die I promise you life-changing
injuries today sir

ROLLO
Thank you

Around Shaggy Beard and Rollo townspeople start to crowd
They are SO DARN EXCITED Robert appears with Rollo’s sword
as well as his Rollo’s MANSERVANT who begins to suit Rollo up
with chain mail On Shaggy Beard’s side the same thing is
happening with his groom

Aislinn and Morwenna appear each holding a twin and they
grin at Birdy in nervous shock

Behind them Perkin with Alf and Gerd and Meg- this is prime
entertainment but there is also a hush- because it has
consequences

Still in the carriage Birdy is watching it all in awe

ROLLO (CONT’D)
And if this duel is won by I Lord
Rollo of Stonebridge then you will
return our Lady

Shaggy Beard nods

SHAGGY BEARD
And if it is won by I Lord Murgaw
of more villages than I can name in
one earthly breath you will hand
me my wife

Rollo nods solemnly

SHAGGY BEARD (CONTD)
Someone say go

ROBERT (0S)
Go

And OFF WE GO

The two men begin- while they aren’t knights they fight with
some power and confidence clearly each serious about
winning It’s unclear for a beat who is on top with each
making some serious strides

Then Shaggy Beard gets Rollo in a compromising position and
he wounds him- a sword slash across the chest that bleeds
Rollo stumbles back weakened and scared

AISLINN
Rollo

ROBERT
Father

ROLLO

It’s alright Robert It’s alright

BIRDY (VO)
I am too afraid to speak but if I
could I would tell you not to lose
blood for me You have Mumma and
the babies to look after Be
careful father

Rollo looks to Aislinn who makes intense powerful eye
contact and blows him a kiss then to Birdy who throws him an
adoring child like gaze of wonder that says she believes him
but moreover that she needs him

And with that he gathers his strength lets out a growl and
charges Shaggy Beard who crumples

SHAGGY BEARD
Oh Christ our Savior my spine My
legs They tingle They tingle Me
back is gone I suffer from a sore
case of spinal weakening Pause
Pause

Robert steps in from the crowd

ROBERT
There is no clause to pause for
spinal weakening Lord

ROLLO
(giddy relieved)
My Lord that is called losing

Robert and Rollo do the Medieval equivalent of a chest bump
Rollo lets out a cry of pain realizing he just chest bumped
with a chest gash

SHAGGY BEARD
I do not call that defeat We
simply ran into a barrier and could
not continue the match We shall
depart forthwith

He staggers towards the carriage

ROLLO
Not without you giving us our lady
you won’t

And then Rollo starts a cheer

ROLLO (CONT’D)
Give us our lady Give us our lady

The whole town joins GIVE US OUR LADY GIVE US OUR LADY
GIVE US OUR LADY

Shaggy Beard’s carriage attempts to pull out but cheering
villagers have circled around it and stopped it GIVE US OUR
LADY The crowd starts to rock his cart Inside Birdy and
Shaggy Beard are being jangled back and forth sliding all
around Shaggy Beard screeches like a little girl

As the carriage stops our Catherine smiling realizes she is
free to just dismount And so she opens the door and hops
out coming face to face with her father who stares
plaintively After a beat he grins

The last image of the scene Birdy in her father’s arms both
cheering

BIRDY (VO)
If I’ve inherited a bit of my
father’s heart I suppose I shall
leave it there in my chest

INT STONEBRIDGE MANOR- BIRDYS CHAMBER- AFTERNOON

Birdy takes her cage walks to the window and opens the door
She releases her birds one by one into the air

BIRDY (VO)
I will never fully fathom what my
father did for me

It’s a beautiful moment as she throws them each out and they
fly through the air with ease and grace

BIRDY (VO)
What any father should do for any
daughter but rarely does Better
late than never

Birdy waves at each of her birds We can hear her call to
them

BIRDY
Goodbye Juniper Goodbye
Breadberry Goodbye Joseph
Goodbye Sir Neal GOODBYE LARD
TURD MY FAVORITE
(whispering)
Do not tell Breadberry

BIRDY (VO)
I wish I could help every girl in
the world but for now I am enough
And I know he has not granted me a
pardon only a reprieve from the
most ungodly beast of marriage but
my father will find that my
gratitude does not mean I have lost
my fight

She releases the final one and smiles to herself running
back toward the hall before she can see it take a massive
nose-dive making a hollow thump

EXT STONEBRIDGE VILLAGESTREAM- DUSK

As dusk falls Birdy walks along the stream The same place
she has always lived looks new and beautiful to her now- the
setting sun creating a rosy glow

She walks up along the field

BIRDY (VO)
It is in this field I raged and
dreamed and met Aelis in secret and
cried over uncle George and over
the fate I have been able to trick
just a bit

She troops through the village

BIRDY (VO)
There is the goat barn where I met
Perkin when I was but a babe
hiding from Morwenna’s silly slap

She walks past the bakery

BIRDY (VO)
And here is where the smell of
bread is so strong it makes me want
to eat the whole entire world as if
it were a mere loaf

Birdy looks out over the sunset town dotted with houses
carts people animals life

BIRDY (VO)
And some day I will take my little
sisters to the tippy top of the
village and say run little girls
Lift your skirts and run for
everyone to see

INT STONEBRIDGE MANOR- BIRDYS CHAMBER- DAY

Birdy lays in her bed hair down scribbling away As she
writes her words appear on screen in her signature cursive

BIRDY (VO)
Here ends the book of Catherine
called Little Bird or Birdy of the
manor of Stonebridge in the shire
of Lincoln the country of England
in the hands of God

Birdy hears a sound and looks out the window down at the
haystacks where Morwenna is in the throes of passion with
the toothless cart driver

MORWENNA
Oh Golden Tiger

Birdy smiles We pull out to reveal Perkin on a separate
stack writing slowly but surely in his own little book
showing the letters to a curious Gerd

BIRDY (VO)
Someday this journal will belong
to my sisters The two of you can
see what I made of becoming a
woman It was not much but it was
my own

INT ABBEY BEDROOM- AFTERNOON
Edward sits at his desk unwrapping a parcel

BIRDY (VO)
For right now it’s up to you to
decide Edward has writing in this
diary made me more learned

It is Birdy’s diary- he opens it to a page with a drawing
Birdy has made- her hand on Jesus’s bum

BIRDY (VO)
Or simply more cheekier

EXT STONEBRIDGE FIELD- SAME TIME- AFTERNOON

Birdy and Perkin play their usual game of fetch He chucks
the stick She runs hard ecstatic to be where she is as he
chases her

Behind Birdy in the distance a man comes on horseback Is
he a stranger A messenger Another suitor for her to fight

It doesn’t matter right now because what she doesn’t know
can’t hurt her and there’s so much she doesn’t yet know She
is panting having caught the stick and she throws it for
Perkin who takes off The man on horseback looms closer

BIRDY (VO)
Things girls can do run in the
fields invent original curses
save the day pee standing up well
that one was a bit tricky and keep
fighting no matter who may come
on horseback

She raises her chin her hair sweaty to her brow and makes
eye contact with the camera Is that a wink we see

She looks behind her and notices the man then looks back at
us Shaking her head

THE END
