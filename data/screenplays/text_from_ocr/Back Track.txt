INT NEON SIGN FACTORY - DAY

An immense blacked-out hangar full of blinking NEON SIGNS

Some are advertising signs others display sequences of
crawling words

ABUSE OF POWER COMES AS NO SURPRISE

BEING SURE OF YOURSELF MEANS YOURE A FOOL

DONT PLACE TOO MUCH TRUST IN EXPERTS

ANNE BENTON studies one of the signs intently
The sign says EVERYTHING THATS INTERESTING IS NEW

MARGARETS VOICE

There must be something wrong with
the wiring Can we fix it
ELECTRICIAN

older than ANNE and fond of silver bracelets

She holds THREE 8X10 PHOTOGRAPHS

MARGARET

MARGARET

ANNE studies the 8X10s in MARGARETs hands

TWO PICTURES OF ANNE and the mock-up Of an announcement

ANNEs gallery show -- with a blank space where ANNES
PHOTOGRAPH should be

of

ANNE looks at the photos and grimaces
MARGARET
This one shows your take-charge
facade But I dont know I like

girlish vulnerability
They look at each other and laugh
A FACTORY WHISTLE GOES OFF ANNE checks her watch again
ANNE
Oh Christ Ive really got to

She turns to go MARGARET thrusts the PHOTOGRAPHS
in ANNEs face

MARGARET

Without looking ANNE picks and 8X10 hands it to
MARGARET and is gone MARGARET looks down at it

ANNE has picked the MOCK-UP with no face

MARGARET sighs

EXTERIOR FREEWAY SAN PEDRO - EVENING

ANNEs 1968 Mustang Convertible cuts skillfully thru traffic
The lights of San Pedros gas and oil refineries burn
against the evening sky

INT MUSTANG - NIGHT

ANNE looks at her watch accelerates to 75
She pops a tape into the cassette player --

BANG A tire explodes
EXT FREEWAY - NIGHT
The Mustang skids across the freeway

ANNE steers it to the shoulder of the road
The car lurches to a stop

Shit

ANNE opens the trunk

The trunk is full of posters and gallery invitations
art magazines The SPARE TIRE is rotted and shredded
EXT SIDE OF THE FREEWAY - NIGHT

ANNE walks towards the lights of a GAS STATION half a mile
ahead

A CAR filled with BEER-DRINKING GUYS slows as it passes
her The GUYS yell at her

ANNE rolls her eyes She cuts down the grassy
incline to the service road
EXT SERVICE ROAD - NIGHT

ANNE climbs thru a hole in a rusted CYCLONE FENCE
A sign on the fence says LIQUID NATURAL GAS - EXPLOSIVE

ANNE hears ANGRY VOICES

TWO CARS and a HELICOPTER are parked adjacent to the

LIQUID NATURAL GAS PLANT In the light of the oil burn-off
towers two men are arguing - CARELLI and RIANETTI

Both are smartly dressed attended by FOUR OTHER MEN
in suits -- among them the lawyer LUPONI

ANNE stops and watches them

CARELLI shakes a fist at RIANETTI

RIANETTI answers with an under-the-chin finger flick
starts to enter his Mercedes

CARELLI leaps at him and viciously crunches RIANETTIs
head downward into the car roof once twice
then smashes it thru the drivers side window
RIANETTI slumps to the ground barely conscious and
bleeding badly CARELLI pulls him up by the hair
slits his throat with a SWITCHBLADE
CARELLI sidesteps to avoid the spurting blood
CARELLI
(pointing to RIANETTIS BODYGUARD)
Get rid of him
The OTHER MEN pull out GUNS and shoot RIANETTIS BODYGUARD
ANNE backtracks fast towards the Freeway

CARELLI marches up and down trying to calm himself
HE SEES ANNE

CARELLI
Jesus Christ Greek stop her
EXT SIDE OF THE FREEWAY - NIGHT

As she reaches the road ANNE hears the whoosh of a BULLET
whizzing by her head She looks back and sees a man
steading a pistol with both hands propped by his elbows
on the chain link fence

OTHER MEN are running up the hill towards her

ANNE runs along the Freeway A beat-up VW BUS comes up
behind her She flags it down and jumps in

As the BUS speeds away TWO MEN reach the road --

measures the distance --

MILO
Okay

towards the San Pedro Harbor

EXT SAN PEDRO HARBOR - BEFORE DAWN

FROM THE AIR

Smoke still rises from the TERMINUS

A CARGO BOAT pulls out into the Harbor

headed for the open sea

EXT CARGO BOAT SOUTH PACIFIC - DAY

MILO and ANNE take the sun in two lounge chairs
MILO plays his saxophone

ANNE laughs and laughs

A HUGE METAL DOOR SWINGS SHUT ON THE SCENE

And for a second all is in darkness

Then one of ANNES ARTPIECEs appears and says in a crawl
THE END

And FADING AWAY we hear a lone last TOOT from MILOS
SAXOPHONE and one final light LAUGH from ANNE

THE SOUND OF THE SEA fades away into the distance
