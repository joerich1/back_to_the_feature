NT SUBURBAN HOME (JONNIES ROOM) - MORNING
SUBTITLE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN LAJOLLA CALIFORNIA

Typical high school kids chamber Movie posters rule the walls
The ceilings dressed in black Junk food THRASHER magazines
and school books litter the wall-to-wall carpeted deck The
radio snaps on to the two BOBS in action

An annoying rooster crow introduces the duo

BOB1 (OS)
Gooooooodmorning cowboys and cowgirls
Im Bob

BOB2 (OS)

And Im Bob too

BOB1 (OS)
Its the Bob and Bob show Now before
any of you people out there switch over
to another station--

A hand bolts out from under the blankets and bashes the radio
dead The boy connected to the hand remains veiled beneath the
sheets His name is JONNIE ROCQUET

JONNIES MOM (OS)
Wake up honey Youre gonna be late for
school again

JONNIE
Five minutes mom

Alarm clock radio indicates 701 am Time passes The clock now
indicates 845 am The radio is resuscitated

BOB1 (0S)
--a chance to win tickets to the
premiere showing of a premiere movie
starring a premiere kinda guy“Shoot me
in the head starring the always funny
Joey Piscopo

A Howard Stern book crushes the radio to silence
The rest of Jonnie slinks out of bed Hes a slick hip-meister
covered in chocolate colored hair Hes pretty cuteat least
thats what his parents keep telling him

Erect before his window he CRACKS every part of his body
audibly Everyday folk trudge past his view as he kicks into
some basic stretching exercises Within a few seconds his body
glistens in sweat

He notices MRSRIVERS walk by and kindly waves hello The
woman acts shocked and offended She quickly shuffles away A
SHOT of Jonnie from behind reveals his total nudity

Jonnies Casey Kasem phone rings He picks it up

JONNIE
(into phone)
Yello

JONNIES MOM
Honey I just wanted to remind you to
pick up your tux after school I dont
have time to pick it up and your
father well hes befriended the drink
again

JONNIE
Sure thing mom

JONNIES MOM
And dont forget to wake Kyle

JONNIE
Mom did you make my break--

JONNIES MOM
Made you some cereal sweetums Kiss
kiss

They hang up Jonnie pats the Casey phone on the head He turns
and steps right into a pizza box He tears a slice of pie from
his foot and promptly snacks it down

He rummages through some dirty laundry on the floor He picks up
a David Lee Roth shirt grimaces and chucks it aside A black
T-shirt soon bares his back The radio breathes once again
BOB1
Lotta congestion out there today
(he coughs)

BOB2
(laughing hysterically)
Now an oldie but a goodie from the man
from down underTom Jones

As the SONG starts playing Jonnie desperately leaps across the
room over his bed and SLAPS the radio to the floor

INT SUBURBAN HOME (BATHROOM) - MORNING

Jonnie filters through his morning rituals

He loads a small cup full of breath freshener He swings his
head back and swallows the shot of Scope straight

His hair is a mess He slaps some gel into his mane and
disappears OFFSCREEN When he reappears a second later his hair
is impeccable

A cool splash of water over his face results in the
disappearance of his half-beard

He spreads some blue toothpaste on his toothbrush He brushes
each side of his mouth ONCE then spits it all out

As he looks in the mirror his reflection says
JONNIE REFLECTION
Prom night and you dont even have a

date

Jonnie rubs his eyes shakes his head and looks back at his
reflection The reflection does not respond Jonnie sighs in
relief Waltzing out of the bathroom he hears

JONNIE REFLECTION
Yeah Im still here

Jonnies still trying to smear some of that blue toothpaste off
his fingers and onto the walls

INT JONNIES HOUSE (HALLWAY) - MORNING

Jonnie opens the door to his older brother KYLEs room
JONNIE

kissing a puppy is posted over his bed

KYLE (0OS)
(groggily)
I just woke up Give me a break squirt

JONNIE
Your ass not mine

KYLE (0OS)
Up in a second tough guy

Jonnie gives up shutting the door

As he walks down the hallway he passes a well-dressed man in a
business suit fixing his tie in front of a mirror

JONNIE
Have a nice day Kyle

KYLE
Later squirt

Irene

MAURY

Jonnie shoves a Kermit mug of coffee in the microwave He opens
the fridge and notices a mustard container on the top shelf and
some baking soda in the bottom Nothing else Jonnie moves the
mustard over in search of food

INT DAFFIE HIGH SCHOOL (HALLWAY) - MORNING

Jonnie hops and whistles his way down the hallway He notices
two yarmulke-bearing kids talking to MRBRAUN

ID1
Theyre anti-Semitic sir They hate our
guts

MR BRAUN

That is simply not true David You must
learn to give people the benefit of the
doubt sometimes

KID2
Sir I agree with David These kids are
not like us They do not like our kind

MR BRAUN
Ive heard just about enough out of you
two Youre in high school now
Everybody here is equal Now get into
class

As the two boys enter the room we see twenty SKINHEADS garbed
in red suspenders white T-shirts and combat boots sitting at
their desks

As Jonnie walks past another classroom he hears a kid getting
yelled at inside

SCREAMING TEACHER
You are a disgrace to me to yourself
to your fellow students to your
parents You are a social invalid a
buffoon a certified moron an
embarrassment You are nothing and best
of all you will never amount to
anything

As the verbal carnage continues Jonnie peeks inside the room
He notices a 14-YEAR OLD SCHOOL GIRL getting bawled out by an
75-year old NUN He continues his march

Jonnie finally reaches Mr Kurtzs infamous office He opens the
door to the SOUNDS OF A JUNGLE He walks in and sits down before
the SECRETARY

SECRETARY
Well well well If it isnt Mr
Popularity

JONNIE
Im Jonnie Rocquet

SECRETARY
Oh Im sorry Youre not Laurence
Popularity

JONNIE
No maam

SECRETARY
I guess he already went in

We hear Kurtz bellowing from inside his puny office

PRINCIPAL KURTZ (0OS)
We found it in your locker This kind of
filth will not be allowed on our school
property Is that understood

LAURENCE (0OS)
Yesm

PRINCIPAL KURTZ (0OS)
Youre lucky that Im not expelling you
this very instant young man This is
garbage for the mind and oh-so easy to
get hooked on

LAURENCE (0OS)
Im sorry sir will never--

PRINCIPAL KURTZ (0OS)
Silence Just take this trash and
leave Go

The door opens and LAURENCE walks out with a BIBLE in his hand
Jonnie straddles on in and sits down

PRINCIPAL KURTZ
Sit down mboy sit down

JONNIE
I am sitting sir

PRINCIPAL KURTZ
Very well then lets begin As you must
know by now you and I have been going
at each other for the past few years
and I think its about time we bury the
hatchet

JONNIE
Are you serious sir

PRINCIPAL KURTZ
Well Ive been thinking it over for the
past couple of minutes and I think that
the evil principal hating his students
thing just sounds a little too much
like a script to a bad movie
JONNIE
ll drink to that
(swigs a shot of whiskey)

PRINCIPAL KURTZ
think you are ripe enough now to
recognize my authority as being
legitimate and meaningful and I have
come to realize that you are far from
being the worst nut in the bunch So for
our mutual best interest why dont we
just cut the cancer and let it be

JONNIE
(Liverpool accent)
Thats sounds pretty neat sir

PRINCIPAL KURTZ
Not only is it neat Jonnie-boy but it
is also required You see its about
time that you come to realize that
principals are not always there to be
your enemy Their lives do not revolve
around being this symbol of
intimidation

Jonnie sees a book resting on Kurtzs desk its entitled
to intimidate your students and make them your enemy

JONNIE
I see Well I guess I could try--

How

Kurtz covers the book with another one entitled Sex The One-

man Show
PRINCIPAL KURTZ

She can hear MRAVERY inside

Taz hides behind a wall He peers down a long empty hallway but
doesnt spot a soul He quickly shuffles his way to the front of

covers his mouth and powers his way in A second later
Principal Kurtz slips out Cigar hanging from his lips

shit and puddles of piss mine the floor Actual pieces of
excrement rest on the toilet seat He SLAMS the door shut

Behind the second stall he discovers two fellow students
conversing They turn to Taz with no reaction then talk on

The third stall offers a naked janitor sitting on the throne
with a Janitorial Life magazine glued to his hands

The final stall is empty and sparkles in cleanliness Taz enters
the stall as the rest of the folk exit the premises

Taz covers the entire head with toilet paper Everything from
the flusher and the paper holder to the walls and the floor

As he rests his rear upon the seat he contorts his face and
body into many different positions The graffiti behind the door
says Flush twice to reach cafeteria Taz smiles and DOWNS the
toilet on two occasions

Tazs excrements drive through a maze of pipes within the
schools infrastructure A RED LIGHT in the kitchen alerts the
staff to step back The waste suddenly plops down into a vat of
the days soup The staff continues their duties

MR RAIMIE
I am very happy with all of your results
on the exam and would just like to go
over some of the main points that we
discussed over the past year

Most students shrug in indifference Chalk to board MrRaimie
jots down some theories Some students take this time to lean on
their desk and catch some Z’s Suddenly he stops and his chalk
drops to the floor

MR RAIMIE
What am I doing
(a beat)

What the hell am I doing Im a 36-year
old man Is this my life

The students dont seem too disturbed by his inquisition

MR RAIMIE
Its definitely not here
(pointing to the board)
I dont understand this I mean I can
explain it and all but it means nothing
to menor you Its all a bunch of
games

Some of the students start to take notice

MR RAIMIE
3x-y What How the hell can anyone
subtract letters from other letters
Even more why would anyone want to

More and more students appear to be paying attention now

MR RAIMIE
(raising his voice)
This stuff will not help you people in
real life My hand to God
(raising his hand)
Its all a bunch of pops and buzzes
Half the time Im on the bottle anyway

The class seem amused by this outburst MrRaimie steps over to

suit and some doughboy is making more
money than me

(screams)
Im teaching youand youre ina
higher tax bracket than me

(a beat)
And I dont even get free burgers at the
end of the day

MrRaimie removes his necktie and drops it to the floor The
class is mesmerized as he shuffles his way to a window

MR RAIMIE
(calmly)
Theres life out there people And Im
standing here in a two-dollar suit
(removes jacket and shirt)
Thats it Im out

MrRaimie exhales aloud as he walks over to the door
MR RAIMIE

disgusting
MrBoile jumps up and shuffles Taz to the door Taz suddenly
notices a BigMac wrapper in the garbage

MR BOILE
Well thank you for all the kind words

MR BOILE

bottle of wine and his feet soon grace the top of the teachers
desk

seat He sits with his feet up on the desk hands behind his
head A crowbar couldnt get that damn smile of his face

Principal Kurtz walks into the classroom

Taz looks down on his paper but appears to be in a chronic state
of perplexity Finally he smiles and jots down an answer He is
proud of himself We show his exam paper It reveals his name
scratched upon the title page

The clock is TICK-TICKING away

Tazs frustration leads him to scan the classroom for help
Karen is writing away Joey is trying to figure out which side
of the paper is up Allison is reading some adoption pamphlets
Frank is building a mountain of eraser residue

Taz glances at the clock it is 245

Taz starts to sweat He knows hes a goner He stares out the
window and sees a paper airplane with formulas on it fly by He
shakes his head and returns to the task at hand

The TICK-TICKING increases in volume as Taz sweats harder and
harder He notices a couple of other students also covering
their ears to block out the clocks sound Taz looks to the
front of the class and raises his arm

MR COWAN
What is it MrMinelli

TAZ
Could you please do something about all
that noise

MrCowan removes the seven clocks that were on his desk

MR COWAN
But of course your majesty

INT MECHANICS CLASS - AFTERNOON

Several price points are enumerated on the blackboard MR
CHEETE stands before the class in his dirty overalls Jonnie is
stationed in the back row with Jade

MR CHEETE
What did we learn this year Well
lets go over some of the basics First
things first you look under the hood
and find there to be a simple problem
with the carburetor A replacement part
will cost 50-55 dollars How much do
we charge

FERRIS
Sixty-five dollars

MrCheete shakes his head no

DANTE
One hundred dollars

MR CHEETE
No but youre getting closer

The class hushes up MrCheete turns to the blackboard and shows
them the various price points

MR CHEETE

This is the easiest part of the class
people With any sort of minor
adjustment all you need to do is
multiply the actual charge by three For
example the carburetor would cost
anywhere from 150 to 175 depending on
whether youre dealing with a man or a
woman

The students furiously transcribe his wise words

MR CHEETE
If its a major reconstructive
operation or at least something that
looks like its major to your client
then you will likely have to charge them
seven times the going rate Eight times
if theyre giving you attitude But the
biggest ball of wax comes from those
please sir you have to help me fix my
car or Ill never get home out-of-
towners Thats why its always
important to

CLASS IN UNISON
Check the license plate before you check
the hood

MR CHEETE
Very good kids Very good Ten times
the actual charges for regulars twelve
times if theyre Japanese

The class laughs it up Even the Japanese students

INT TAZS EXAM ROOM - AFTERNOON

A SERIES OF SHOTS show Taz in several positions of cheating He
checks under his shirt collar for a piece of paper He takes it
out and jots several things down on his exam

He looks over at ANNIE and writes down a couple of her
responses Annie does the same to MARVIN on her right Marvin
looks over at MARYs paper And Mary seems to be copying her
answers from a MONKEY perched at the final desk

Taz takes his algebra book out of his bag and puts it on his
desk He looks up at MrCowan who is reading a GUIDE TO
SUBSTITUTE TEACHING handbook and jots down some formulas

Lifting his shirt sleeve he copies some of the tattooed
formulas from his arm to his test paper

He blows a huge bubble with his gum From inside the bubble he
takes out a paper with several other answers on it

He shoves the piece of gum directly under his desktop This side
of the desk is covered in a myriad of motley colored gumwads
along with a couple of chocolate bars

Taz looks over at Eugenes paper to his left Eugene covers his
answers Taz smiles at him and mouths the words number six
Eugene mouths the words fuck you in response Taz raises his
thumb up and jots down Eugenes reply

The rest of his classmates are procrastinating One student is
scoping the room with his Army binoculars Another is printing
down his will A third scrapes an immaculate re-creation of the
outdoor scenery into his desk with a knife

MrCowan smokes a nice long fat joint before the class

INT MECHANICS CLASS - AFTERNOON

able to apply them into practice one
day and become really rich

again Still 335 He looks at Mr Cowan who just smiles back
and winks

MRCOWAN

pencil flies from his palm and blood spits out

Kyle can you get off the phone please

Kyle releases a massive lascivious grunt A beat

KYLE
(into phone)
Thats okayI was done anyway

They both hang up and Jonnie quickly dials up his friend Taz
After five longs rings someone finally picks it up

We hear the Indiana Jones THEME SONG play over the phone Taz is
scrounged into his massive EZ chair Indiana Jones hat on and
lights dimmed down low

By his side lie some chips and Doritos a pack of Oreo cookies
a 2-liter Coke bottle a bucket of ice and a whip

JONNIE

Jonnie reaches his table and sits next to Taz and Jade Suzie
checks her makeup Jonnie doesnt waste a minute and raises his
glass of wine to the Gods

Jonnie sets his glass down on the table and takes out a piece of
toast He looks at it and says

COACH DJOKSTRAAP approaches principal Kurtz near the stage

COACH DJOKSTRAAP

A basketball game is taking place in the gym as the prom
continues There are fans in the crowd Players jump over
tables and knock people over on the dance floor

The prom MUSIC chimes through the speakers sporadically
interrupted with calls from the game

JEAN-PAUL the waiter strides over to Jonnies table

Jonnie gets up and stumbles away from the table As he walks
across the gym he is struck in the face by a basketball

REFEREE
Interference

Jonnie continues his dalliance through the gym and notices
MrRaimie slow dancing with Lisa Cox in the corner He also
spots Joey Titroni filling the punch bowl with some cognac He
smiles and walks past him

Unbeknownst to him Joey continues his mix by adding some
gasoline pills a Walkman and some anti-freeze

Jonnie staggers over to TONY SINGER whos perched before the
huge dance floor

JONNIE

Tony notices a MENACING-LOOKING FELLOW with sunglasses walk into
the ballroom He quickly ducks behind Jonnie

TONY

JONNIE

Tony climbs his way out of the nearest open window
Principal Kurtz steps up to the mike before the audience

PRINCIPAL KURTZ
Excuse me Testing one-two--

His voice is cut off by a tremendous cheer from the crowd The
home team scored a three-pointer

PRINCIPAL KURTZ
I would just to re-iterate my apologies

Eugene gets slammed to the floor by a player on the run

PRINCIPAL KURTZ
Eugeneyoure holding up the game

table

PRINCIPAL KURTZ
The game is almost over folks

One of the players slam-dunks crashes the backboard over a
complete dining table below The people continue to eat
PRINCIPAL KURTZ

The crowd cheers

PRINCIPAL KURTZ
(opening the envelope)
They tell me that it was a close call
this year but in the end your choice

(a beat)
Mr Kevin Raimie and Ms Lisa Cox

The crowd goes delirious as the lucky couple stride onto the
podium Kurtz is handed another note He reads it shakes Mr
Raimies hand and whispers into his ear

PRINCIPAL KURTZ
(points to back of gym)
Some folks want to speak to you
afterwards

FOUR POLICE OFFICERS in full uniform await the teacher as he
approaches the microphone

MR RAIMIE
I know them well Uhhmmlet me begin
by thanking the people without whom any
of this would not have been possible My
bitch of an ex-wife who left my sorry-
ass twelve years ago--

Taz stands alone in the rear of the ballroom He rests his back
up against the wall and his lips against a glass of whiskey

A cute young girl named SOPHIE CHOICE walks up to him

SOPHIE

Jonnie rests himself up on a wall behind Joey and SAMMY

SAMMY
She did me all night long man Like a
monkey on a banana

JOEY
A greased monkey I bet

SAMMY
Huh Yeah whatever All I know is that

SAMMY

Joey laughs it up as Diana strolls by the boys

DIANA
Hey Sammy hey Joey
SAMMY

JOEY

Jonnie reacts negatively to an upheaval in his stomach and
charges to the bathroom As he stumbles by a young COUPLE
dancing he hears another GUY cut in

NEW GUY
Do you mind if I cut in

GIRL
Not at all

The girl leaves and the two boys start to slow dance together
Jonnie quickens his pace to the commode

We CUT to Taz and his newfound friend still babbling away

TAZ

pulls her back

TAZ

related

SOPHIE
Huh

TAZ

(crossing his fingers)

SOPHIE

We hear a SHATTERING of glass as Tazs whiskey drink crashes to
the floor A womans SCREAM is heard from afar
TAZ
Indiana Jones

SOPHIE

TAZ

(a beat)

Taz walks away

INT DAFFIE HIGH BALLROOM (BATHROOM) - EVENING

We show the outside of a bathroom stall from which we can hear
horrendous sounds emanating The place stinks

The door flaps open and Jonnie stumbles out He is covered in
his evening meal Upon this sight four other guys hit the
stalls and revisit their respective dinners

Jonnie looks at the mirror and sees his reflection

JONNIE REFLECTION
Youre an idiot Rocquet An idiot
Dont you realize that there is only one
true blue girl thats been loving you
for yearsnamely Jade The girl is
crazy about you and here you are
wasting your parents hard earned money
on some sleazy bimbo with a lip
condition I think youve been watching
one too many high school comedies my
friend

Jonnie soaks his head in the sink and stares at the mirror
JONNIE
(at his reflection)

Youre right youre absolutely right

Jonnie marches out of the washroom with conviction

The crowd parts as he makes his way out into the ballroom A MAN

IN A DOCTORS UNIFORM slips him a couple of pills

MAN IN DOCTORS UNIFORM
(in Jonnies ear)
Call me in the morning

Jonnie pops the pills into his mouth and tosses his eternally
stained shirt onto an adjacent dinner table

INT DAFFIE HIGH BALLROOM - EVENING

As Principal Kurtz adjusts the microphone a LOUD PIERCING
resonance echoes through the room Several students drop to
their knees cover their ears and cry for help

PRINCIPAL KURTZ
Before we get the live acts out here
indulge me with a few parting words for
the class of 1996
(sincere applause)
I remember back in my days

A collective aaawww rings through the crowd as bottles and
eggs make their way to the stage

Jonnie notices Suzie groping a guy in the corner The boy
reciprocates by groping her right back They go at it Jonnie
jogs on by
We CUT back to Taz and the girl

TAZ
He doesnt want him to be there

SOPHIE
Of course he wants him to be there

TAZ
Theres no way

SOPHIE
He loves his father

TAZ
What Wellokaylets just drop
this allright

SOPHIE
Fine

They both lean quietly up against the back wall

TAZ
Can I ask you a personal question

SOPHIE
Sure Indy

TAZ
I just wanted tono I cant do this

SOPHIE
No pleasego ahead

TAZ

Well this is a very important question
to me and it scares me that Im even
attempting to ask you this but here
goes

(breathes heavily)
If you are such a big Indiana Jones fan
as you claim you are and if in fact
you have seen the collective three films
a total of 27 timesnot counting the
TV viewings which are edited and
allwhy do you keep renting them when
you could just as easily buy the set and
call it a night

SOPHIE
Is that it

TAZ
Please just answer the question

SOPHIE

Well as any real Indiana Jones fan
would know by now the renting of these
videos over and over again is a simple
tactical decision made on my part to
ensure that the makers of these great
films continue to receive the residuals
from each renting and fully absorb the
relentless and uncompromising demand
and love for this genius of a series

Taz flicks a roach from Sophies shoulder

TAZ
Is that it

SOPHIE

And it is as they come to cherish this
undaunted demand for these films that
they will invariably be succumbed by an
overpowering feeling of passion
excitement intensity known in other
circles as greed or guilt and perhaps
just perhaps attempt to grace us with
the rudiments of a deserving fourth
member

(a beat)
Whats wrong Indy

TAZ
(tears in his eyes)
Will you marry me

We CUT to Jonnie who sees Jade sitting with MrBoile

KURTZ (OS)
and once Nixon got into power the
whole boat took a nose-dive

JONNIE
Excuse me do you mind if I cut in

MR BOILE
Will you please excuse us Jade

JONNIE
No no Actually I wanted to speak to
Jade aloneif thats possible

MR BOILE
Sure Why wouldnt that be possible

Jonnie takes Jade by the hand and drags her away

JONNIE
Forget it

Jonnie searches the hall for a private area

KURTZ
And now an excellent new band comprised
of two of our own graduates anda
couple of members from the original
band Singing the all-time classic
anthem Cum on feel the noizeLOUD
WHISPER

The rockers in the crowd go nuts Several of them gather around
the stage and bust their heads against the steel posts Two of

them just punch each other repeatedly in the head Others start
stage-diving into the empty dance floor crashing to the floor

Finally the band comes out They are made up of four well-
groomed boys draped in brown suits The song that they sing is
an extreme slow version of QUIET RIOTs classic monster anthem
Cum on feel the noize Couples begin to slowdance

BAND LEADER
(singing)
Come on feel the noise Girls rock
your boys Well get wild wild
wildoh yeahwild wild--

Jonnie storms the womans bathroom with Jade by his side

INT WOMANS WASHROOM - EVENING

As soon as Jonnie crosses the threshold of the girls room the
women inside go berserk A plethora of Kleenexes fly through the
air as many seemed to be caught mid-bra-stuff Two girls put
their wigs back on and another who was standing at a urinal
zips herself back up and walks out

JADE
Jonnie do you mind telling me what this
is all about

JONNIE
Hold on one sec

Jonnie bends under the first stall and takes a looksie He
notices two feet Same goes for the second stall The third
stall has two hands on the floor The fourth stall does not
appear to have anyone inside

Jonnie opens the door to find a FEMALE MIDGET perched atop the
crown cigar chopping at her bit

FEMALE MIDGET
Do you mind

The female midget slams the door in Jonnies face

JADE
(holding Jonnie up)
Jonnie what is this all about

JONNIE
Look Jade I really need to talk to you
alone Lets go over here

Jonnie moves to the corner and begins to pour his heart out

JONNIE
Jade Ive been a fool Its been over
four years and Ive been the biggest
fool I know how much you cared about me
during that period but I guess I always
took you for granted

At this point the BOOM enters the view of the CAMERA and can be
seen by the audience It disappears just as quickly

JONNIE

All that time I was too busy thinking
about myself and what was most important
to me without ever realizing what I had
right in front of my very eyes

(a beat)
You

(Jonnies eyes begin to swell

up)

The BOOM reappears before the two characters hangs there for a
couple of seconds then retracts
JONNIE
I know that it might be too late for us
now and I know that Ive been a total
ass for the last few years but it
wasnt until everything came together
tonight that I realized how much you
actually mean to me--

This time the BOOM hovers itself right in front of Jonnies nose

for a few seconds until it is finally touching his fa
ACTOR playing Jonnie loses it

ACTOR PLAYING JONNIE

(British accent)
That was it David That was it I get
one bloody-awful decent scene in the
whole bloody script and the fuckin
boom wanker cant do his job right Th
one decent line in the whole script

DIRECTOR OF FILM
And action

At this point we reshoot the last piece of dialogue
films SOUNDTRACK continues as before

JONNIE
I know that it might be too late for us
now and I know that Ive been a total
ass for the last few years but it
wasnt until everything came together
tonight that I realized how much you

JADE

your chance and you blew it Next time

their heart of heartstry paying a
little closer attention to them Dont

With this Jade SLAPS Jonnie right across the face and storms
out of the bathroom with APPLAUSE from the CAMERA CREW A
distressed Jonnie peers into the CAMERA and says

JONNIE
(in his British accent)
Line

INT DAFFIE HIGH BALLROOM - EVENING
Jonnie comes sloping out of the womens bathroom with toilet
paper hanging from his ass and running off his shoes People

point and laugh at him as he slinks by

Meanwhile four heavy-metal guys are rocking the stage with a
speed metal version of MC HAMMERs Cant touch this
Jonnie makes his way over to Taz who is still speaking to
Sophie Taz is demonstrating how Indiana Jones stole the idol in
the first installment by replacing the weight of the idol with
another item of the same weight

JONNIE
Hey bud what up

As Jonnie makes his way out the door he leans over to the water
fountain for a drink Filled with gum the water doesnt flow
out very easily But upon Jonnies insistence a sudden stream
of water flies straight up his nose
On stage a black man with a long Fabio-like mane
out a slow tune If only I knew your nameif only

EXT DAFFIE HIGH - LATE NIGHT

Jonnie stands before a glass pane that covers the
the school He is holding a rock in his hand Taz
