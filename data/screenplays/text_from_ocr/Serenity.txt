SERENITY
‘We see the Earth

White pops blossom on the surface and moments later ships --
huge intricate space-freighters -- come roaring from the
surface passing camera with a thunder of gas and flame

We hear a womans voice

VOICEOVER
Earth-That-Was could no longer
sustain our numbers we were so
many

We see a solar system a sun like our own surrounded by many
more planets than ours they in turn surrounded by moons

VOICEOVER
(continuing)
We found a new galaxy dozens of
planets and hundreds of moons

We see a terraform station a bunker-like complex many miles
across air billowing from it electricity running over it

VOICEOVER
(continuing)
Each one terraformed -- a process
taking decades -- to support human

life To be new Earths
We see a futuristic megalopolis gleaming and cool

VOICEOVER
(continuing)
The Central Planets were the first
settled and are the most advanced
embodying civilization at its peak

We see an empty desert plain then pull out to see the entire
planet -- and further to see were on the edge of the galaxy

VOICEOVER

(continuing)
Life on the outer planets is much
more primitive and difficult
Thats why the Central planets
formed the Alliance so everyone
can enjoy the comfort and
enlightenment of true
civilization Thats why we
fought the War for Unification

During this a woman steps in front of the last image and we
see it is on a wall screen in a
EXT CLASSROOM - DAY

Its a group of twelve-year-olds serious and well dressed
They sit on their heels under a sparsely elegant tent small
wooden desks with embedded screens in front of them The
tent is on a lawn surrounded by lush foliage People walk
about and vehicles glide quietly overhead A utopian vista

GIRL
Now that the wars over our
soldiers get to come home yes

TEACHER
Some of them Some will be
stationed on the rim planets as
Peace Enforcers

BOY
I dont understand Why were the
Independents even fighting us
Why wouldnt they look to be more
civilized

TEACHER
Thats a good question Does
anybody want to open on that

GIRL
I hear theyre cannibals

ANOTHER BOY
Thats only Reavers

ANOTHER GIRL
Reavers arent real

ANOTHER BOY
Full well they are They attack
settlers from space they kill
them and wear their skins and rape
them for hours and hours --

TEACHER

(in Chinese)
We will enjoy your silence now

(calmer)
Its true that there are
dangers on the outer planets So
lets follow up on Borodins
question With all the social and
medical advancements we can bring
to the Independents why would
they fight so hard against us
RIVER
We meddle

TEACHER
River Im sorry

RIVER is a dark intense little girl writing with one hand
and typing with the other (Typing consists of holding a
long wooden stylus and tapping either end down different
columns of chinese characters on her desktop screen) She is
a good two years younger than the other kids

RIVER
People dont like to be meddled
with We tell them what to do
what to think dont run dont
walk were in their homes and in
their heads and we havent the
right Were meddlesome

TEACHER
(gently taking her
stylus)
River were not telling people
what to think Were just trying
to show them how

She violently PLUNGES the stylus into the girls forehead --
‘ INT LAB - NIGHT

And we FLASH CUT to the actual present a 16 year old RIVER
sitting in a metal chair needles stuck in her skull (one
right where the teacher had stuck her) being adjusted by a
technician A second monitors her brain patterns

The lab is cold blue steel Insidiously clean

2ND TECHNICIAN
Shes dreaming

FIRST TECHNICIAN
Nightmare

2ND TECHNICIAN
Off the charts Scary monsters

DOCTOR MATHIAS
Lets amp it up Delcium eight-
drop

DOCTOR MATHIAS is not instantly likable -- nor gradually for
that matter A cold man and more than a little satisfied
with himself
Behind him stands a GOVERNMENT INSPECTOR observing And
making him a little nervous

The Inspector is in shadow but his uniform indicates
substantial rank as does the eagle-crested baton -- no
longer than a ruler -- that he clutches in one gloved hand

DOCTOR MATHIAS
(continuing)
See most of our best work is done
when theyre asleep We can
monitor and direct their
subconscious implant
suggestions

River starts convulsing mewing in misery The Inspector
starts forward slowly

DOCTOR MATHIAS
(continuing)
Its a little startling to see
but the results are spectacular
Especially in this case River
Tam is our star pupil

The Inspector steps into the light He is rigid cold
staring at the girl with no emotion at all His name as we
will very soon learn is SIMON

SIMON
Ive heard that

DOCTOR MATHIAS
Shes a genius Her mental
capacity is extraordinary even
with the side-effects

SIMON
Tell me about them

DOCTOR MATHIAS
Well obviously shes unstable
the neural stripping gives them
heightened cognitive reception
but it also destabilizes their own
reality matrix It manifests as
borderline schizophrenia which
at this point is the price for
being truly psychic

SIMON
(moves toward her)
What use do we have for a psychic
if shes insane
DOCTOR MATHIAS
I dont have to tell you the
security potential of someone who
can read minds And she has lucid
periods -- we hope to improve upon
the Im sorry Sir I have to
ask if theres some reason for
this inspection

SIMON
(turning)
Am I making you nervous

DOCTOR MATHIAS
Key members of Parliament have
personally observed this subject
I was told their support for the
project was unanimous The
demonstration of her power --

SIMON
(turns back to her)
How is she physically

DOCTOR MATHIAS
Like nothing weve seen All our
subjects are conditioned for
combat but River shes a
creature of extraordinary grace

SIMON
Yes She always did love to dance

He drops to one knee slamming his baton to the floor
ANGLE THE BATON

As the top pops off like a bouncing betty (the grenade)
flying up over Simon and Rivers heads and then bursting
forth in a flat circle of blue energy that bisects the room
flowing through the staffs heads and knocking them out

Simon rushes to River gently removes the probes from her
head and swabs her whispering

SIMON
(continuing)
River Wake up Please its
Simon River Its your brother
Wake up

She begins to stir as a noise moves him to the door looking
out and removing his uniform to reveal an orderlys tunic
beneath
River is suddenly next to him He jumps a little

RIVER
Simon

A beat as they face each other Simon fighting emotion

RIVER
(continuing)
They know youve come

INT GUARD STATION - CONTINUING

As a guard looks at a monitor He mostly resembles a secret
service man -- more bureaucrat than thug A second man rolls
into frame on a chair behind him also watching the screen

INT RESEARCH CENTER CORRIDOR - CONTINUING

Simon walks River through the corridor They approach a pair
of double doors

SIMON
We cant make it to the surface
from inside

Simon turns suddenly as he hears footsteps people heading at
them from the other side of the doors

SIMON
(continuing)
Find a --

But River has impossibly scampered up over some lab
equipment to the dark top of the corridor where she holds
herself in a perfect split feet against the walls and
outstretched hand holding the sprinkler for support

The doors burst open and two doctors pass by hardly noticing
the lone orderly Passing right under River

EXT VENTILATION SHAFT - MOMENTS LATER

Its small 15 feet by 15 feet Goes a long way up and a
long way down One wide hinged window looks in on the hall
inside Simon and River approach with quiet haste

They slip through the window Simon shuts it wedges his
baton into the handle as the SECURITY AGENTS APPROACH They
fire at the glass but their lasers have no effect

Wind whips Rivers hair about as she looks up to see a small
patch of daylight visible ten stories up Sees the sky
blotted out by a small ship that hovers above them
ANGLE THE SHIP is floating over the grass of rolling hills
the city gleaming far beyond This facility is well hidden

A gurney-sized section of the ships belly detaches and drops
down ten stories cables spooling it out of the ship It
comes to Simon and River and stops suddenly

SIMON
Get on

He is standing by the window -- and the Security Agent is
right behind him PUNCHING the window with all his might

Simon helps River onto the gurney then jumps on himself as
the Security Agent cracks the glass The two are whisked up
in the gurney River on her knees Simon standing beside her
holding one of the cables --

THE OPERATIVE (0S)
Stop

The action freezes

THE OPERATIVE (0S)
(continuing)
Lovely Lovely Backtrack

The action REVERSES taking us back to the moment of Simon
and River on the gurney just before it rises

THE OPERATIVE (0S)
(continuing)
Stop

There is a motionless beat River frozen in that crouch and
he steps through what we now see is a hologram of the event
The Governments man Well just call him THE OPERATIVE

He is thoughtful a little removed Wire-rimmed glasses a
suit too nondescript to be a uniform too neat to be casual
wear He is in

INT INSTITUTE RECORDS ROOM - DAY

-- which is long and bare but for drawers of holographic
records a set-up for watching recordings (where the image of
Simon and River floats) and a table with computer and chair
The Operative crosses to the table looks over some papers

THE OPERATIVE
Biograph Simon Tam

CLOSE ON THE OPERATIVES GLASSES
As Simons history files down in print and pictures --
graduation security photo from his medical internship --

over one lens of the Operatives glasses

THE OPERATIVE
(continuing)
Remarkable children

Doctor Mathias storms in two security men (not the ones from
the opening) and a nervous young female intern following
Mathias looks greyer and more gaunt than when we saw him last

DOCTOR MATHIAS
Excuse me No one is allowed in
the records room without my
express permission

THE OPERATIVE
(over this quietly)
Enter the doctor
(to Mathias)
Forgive me I prefer to see the
event alone without bias

Mathias looks at the hologram -- realizes which one it is

DOCTOR MATHIAS
I need to see your clearance

THE OPERATIVE
Youre right to insist I know
youve had security issues here

He places his hand on a screen as he says it

at the readout and drops the bluster

DOCTOR MATHIAS
Apologies An Operative of the
Parliament will of course have
full cooperation

(looks at screen)
Im not sure what I see no
listing of rank or name

THE OPERATIVE
I have neither Like this
facility I dont exist The
Parliament calls me in when
when they wish they didnt have
to Lets talk about the Tams

DOCTOR MATHIAS
I assume youve scanned the status
logs

Mathias looks
THE OPERATIVE
River was your greatest success
A prodigy -- A phenomenon Until
her brother walked in eight months
ago and took her from you

DOCTOR MATHIAS
Its not quite so simple

THE OPERATIVE
Im very aware of that

DOCTOR MATHIAS
He came in with full creds He
beat the ap-scan the retinal
There was no way I could --

THE OPERATIVE
No no Of course The boy spent
his fortune developing the
contacts to infiltrate this place

DOCTOR MATHIAS
Gave up a brilliant future in
medicine as well youve probably
read Turned his back on his
whole life Madness

THE OPERATIVE
Madness no Something a good
deal more dangerous Have you
looked at this scan carefully At
his face

Mathias looks uncertain

THE OPERATIVE
(continuing)
Its love in point of fact He
loved his sister and he knew she
was in pain So he took her
somewhere safe

DOCTOR MATHIAS
Why are you here

THE OPERATIVE
Im here because the situation is
even less simple than you think
(eyeing him)
Do you know what your sin is
Doctor

DOCTOR MATHIAS
I I would be very careful about
what you --

THE OPERATIVE
(sadly)
Its pride

He touches the computer screen and the hologramic image jumps
to the Doctor and Simon in the lab Mathias repeating

DOCTOR MATHIAS
Key members of Parliament have
personally observed this subject
I was told their support --

THE OPERATIVE
(shutting it off)
Key members of Parliament Key
The minds behind every diplomatic
military and covert operation in
the galaxy and you put them ina
room with a psychic

DOCTOR MATHIAS
She was she read cards nothing
more

THE OPERATIVE
Its come to our attention that
River became much more unstable
more disturbed after you
showed her off to Parliament Did
she see something very terrible in
those cards

DOCTOR MATHIAS
Whatever secrets she might have
accidentally gleaned its
probable she doesnt even know she
knows them That theyre buried
beneath --

THE OPERATIVE
But they are in her Her mind is
unguiet Its the will of the
Parliament that I kill her And
the brother Because of your sin
il

THE OPERATIVE

(continuing moving

to his briefcase)
You know in certain older
civilized cultures when men
failed as entirely as you have
they would throw themselves on
their swords

DOCTOR MATHIAS
(fed up)
Well unfortunately I forgot to
bring a sword to --

The air rings crisply as the Operative pulls out his sword

THE OPERATIVE
The Parliament has no further
interest in psychics They
represent a threat to the harmony
and stability of our Alliance

DOCTOR MATHIAS
I would put that down right now if
I were you

THE OPERATIVE
Would you be killed in your sleep
like an ailing pet Whatever your
failings I believe you deserve
better than that

The agents move He slices the throat of the one behind him
with true grace thrusting at the second as hes pulling out
his gun and pinning his hand A moment and the dying agent
reflexively squeezes the trigger shooting his own arm

The Operative pulls out the sword and the agent falls as
quietly as the first

Mathias bolts but the Operative pins him to the wall He
bunches his fingers and jabs the side of the Doctors spine
Mathias stiffens suddenly agonizingly immobile

The Operative steps back observes the Doctors rigid grimace
for a moment Almost ceremoniously he drops to one knee and
holds the blade out to one side hilt to the floor and point
tilted toward the doctor The Doctor stares at it in horror
as his paralyzed body begins to tip over toward it

The Operative turns toward the terrified intern at the door

THE OPERATIVE
(continuing)

Young miss Ill need all the logs-
on behavioral modification
triggers Well have to reach out
to River Tam and help her to come
back to us No matter how far out
Simon has taken her we can --

Hes almost startled when the Doctors body drops into frame
slowed suddenly by the sword It squeaks down the blade the
Doctor unable to cry out as the Operative whispers to him

THE OPERATIVE
(continuing)
This is a good death Theres no
shame in this in a mans death
A man whos done fine works
Were making a better world All
of them better worlds

Mathias is dead The Operative pulls the sword out as the
body rolls over As he wipes the sword down

THE OPERATIVE
(continuing)
Young miss I need you to get to
work now I think I may have a
long way to travel

She goes He approaches River very close staring
THE OPERATIVE
(continuing)

Where are you hiding little girl

The noise is sucked suddenly out of the room as we black out
SERENITY

becomes the name painted on the side of a spaceship with
the same in Chinese behind it

EXT SPACE ORBITING THE MOON LILAC - DAY

We move away from the ship The name is on the nose under
the bridge It sticks out from the body of the ship like a
craning neck The body is bulbous with propulsion engines
on either side and a giant glowing back There are two small
shuttles tucked in over the wings of the engines Its not
the sleekest ship in the verse to be sure

As it hits atmo the propulsion engines take over and she
starts to rock a bit noise filling our ears Camera comes
around the front at the windows and into the bridge to see
the Captain MALCOLM MAL REYNOLDS standing and watching

At that moment a small piece of the nose breaks off and goes
flying past the window

INT BRIDGE - CONTINUING

Note the following sequence will take us through the ship
in one extended STEADICAM shot

The bridge is small two pilot seats on either side and a
tangle of wires and machinery all about

Mal wears the knee-length brown coat and boots of an old

Independent Gun at his hip Hes not unlike the ship --
hes seen a bit of the world and it left him emotionally at
least weathered Right now though hes mostly startled

MAL
What was that

Hes addressing the pilot WASH Flight gear and a hawaiian
shirt toy dinosaurs populating his station -- no old
soldier but just as startled

WASH
Whoah Did you see that --

The ship bucks --

MAL
Was that the primary buffer panel

WASH
It did seem to resemble --
MAL
Did the Primary Buffer Panel just
fall off my gorramn ship for no
apparent reason

Another buck --

WASH
Looks like

MAL
I thought Kaylee checked our entry
couplings I have a very clear
memory of it --

WASH
Yeah well if she doesnt give us
some extra flow from the engine
room to offset the burnthrough
this landing is gonna get pretty
interesting

MAL
Define Interesting

WASH
(calm suggestion )
Oh god oh god were all gonna
die

MAL

(hits the com)
This is the Captain Theres a
little problem with our entry
sequence we may experience slight
turbulence and then explode

(to Wash exiting)
Can you shave the vector --

WASH
Im doing it Its not enough
(hits com)
Kaylee

MAL
dust get us on the ground

WASH
That partll happen pretty
definitely

INT FOREDECK HALL - CONTINUING

The camera leads Mal down On either side of the hall are
ladders leading down to crews personal quarters

The hulking mercenary JAYNE is coming up out of his bunk as
Mal passes He carries a number of rifles and grenades

JAYNE
Were gonna explode I dont
wanna explode

MAL
Jayne how many weapons you plan
on bringing You only got the two
arms

JAYNE
I just get excitable as to choice
like to have my options open

MAL
I dont plan on any shooting
taking place during this job

JAYNE
Well what you plan and what takes
place aint ever exactly been
similar

MAL
No grenades
(Jayne groans)
No grenades

First Mate ZOE enters from the lower level Her mode of
dress and military deference mark her as a war buddy of Mals

ZOE
Are we crashing again

MAL
Talk to your husband Is the mule
prepped

ZOE
Good to go sir Just loading her
up

(to Jayne)

Are those grenades

JAYNE
Capn doesnt want ‘em

ZOE
Were robbing the place Were
not occupying it

All that plays in the background as we lead Mal into the
INT DINING ROOM - CONTINUING

Its the communal space of the ship homey and messy There
is food left lying on the table Mal swipes a dumpling from
a plate pops it in his mouth as another jolt rocks him and
sends most of the tableware clattering to the floor

MAL
(calling out)
Kaylee

He enters
INT AFT HALLENGINE ROOM - CONTINUING

MAL
(still calling)
Kaylee what in the sphincter of
hell are you playing at

The hall leads to the rust-brown chaos that is the engine
room Working around the engine in a forest of wires sparks
and smoke is the sweetly pretty mechanic KAYLEE She passes
Mal with a slightly impatient smile as he stands in the
doorway raising his voice above the din

MAL
(continuing)
We got the Primary Buffer --

KAYLEE
Everythings shiny Capn Not to
fret

MAL
You told me --
(jolt)
You told me the entry couplings
would hold for another week

KAYLEE
(working)
That was six months ago capn

MAL
My ship dont crash If she
crashes you crashed her

Steam and electricity shoot at him backing him up

He turns to see Simon behind him Simon is more seasoned
than before but still contrasts the Captain entirely in
dress and manner He is implacably proper Also pissed

MAL
(continuing)
Doctor Guess I need to get
innocked ‘fore we hit planetside

Simon nods the ship jolting again

MAL
(continuing)
Bit of a rockety ride Nothing to
worry about

SIMON
Im not worried
MAL
Fear is nothing to be ashamed of
Doc
SIMON
This isnt fear This is anger
MAL
(laughs)

Well its kinda hard to tell the
one from tother face like yours

SIMON
I imagine if it were fear my eyes
would be wider

MAL
Ill look for that next time

SIMON
Youre not taking her

MAL
(brushing past him)
No no thats not a thing Im
interested in talking over with --

SIMON
Shes not going with you Thats
final

MAL

(turning back)
I hear the words thats final
come out of your mouth ever again
they truly will be

(turning away again)
This is my boat Yall are guests
on it

He heads down a side corridor that has steps leading down to
INT PASSENGER DORM - CONTINUING

Simon is right on his heels as we lead them down the stairs

SIMON
Guests I earn my passage
Captain --

MAL

And its time your little sister
learned from your fine example

SIMON
Ive earned my passage treating
bullet holes knife wounds laser

burns

MAL
Some of our jobs are trickier than
others --

SIMON

And you want to put my sister in
the middle of that

MAL
Didnt say want Said will
Its one job Doc Shell be fine

The passenger dorm has a time-worn warmth that most of the
ship shares Except of course for the sterile blue of

INT INFIRMARY - CONTINUING
Into which the two men step
SIMON

Shes a seventeen year old girl
A mentally traumatized sevente--
MAL
Shes a reader Sees into the
truth of things might see trouble
before its coming Which is of
use to me

SIMON
And thats your guiding star
isnt it Whats of use

MAL
(laughs)
Honestly doctor I think we may
really crash this time anyway

Simon jabs the inoculation needle into Mals arm

SIMON
Do you understand what Ive gone
through to keep River away from
the Alliance

MAL
I do and its a fact me and mine
have been courteous enough to keep
to our own selves

SIMON
Are you threatening to --

MAL
I got one purpose here keep this
boat in the air I take the jobs
I get -- which is less and less
case you aint been keeping track

He starts away Simon still keeping pace

MAL

(continuing)
Every year since the war the
Alliance pushes just a little
further out towards the rim
Makes it a chore for naughty men
like us to slip about -- and
keeping you two on board means
working twice as hard to avoid the
law Means turning down a score
of honest jobs

INT CARGO BAY - CONTINUING

They enter the biggest space on the ship Giant doors sit at
the front which will open upon landing to reveal a lowering
ramp Catwalks surround the space leading up at the front to
the foredeck hall Weve come all the way through Serenity

MAL
So here is us on the raggedy
edge Dont push me and I wont
push you Are we clear here

Simon starts up the stairs as Mal calls to him

MAL
(continuing)
Things get gritty I will keep her
from the fray but shes coming
Best you get her ready

As Mal walks on we tilt up to see the Mule a four-man
hovercraft hanging from chains near the ceiling Jayne and
Zoe are tossing duffle bags into it

MAL
(continuing)
Zoe is Wash gonna straighten this
boat out before we get flattened

ZOE
Like a downy feather sir Nobody
flies like my mister

The camera picks up Simons feet as they enter foreground on
the catwalk and track with them to find

SIMON
River

Shes lying on her side looking straight at us A loose
summer dress draped over her small frame

RIVER
I know Were going for a ride

EXT LILAC -- DESERT GULCH - DAY

Serenity settles gently down as the cargo bay door opens
INT CARGO BAY - CONTINUING

The chains are hoisted back up into the ceiling of the ship

The mule floats just above the floor Jayne piling in next to
River in the back

SIMON
Now River you stay behind the
others If theres fighting you
drop to the floor or run away
Its okay to leave them to die

River puts on a huge pair of goggles looks at her brother

RIVER
Im the brains of the operation

ZOE
We should hit town right during
Sunday worship Wont be any
crowds

MAL
If Fanty and Mingo are right about
the payroll this could look to be
a sunny day for us

SIMON
(approaching)
Captain Ill ask you one last
time
MAL

Doctor Im taking your sister
under my protection here If
anything happens to her anything
at all I swear to you I will get
very choked up Honestly There
could be tears

He peels out leaves Simon fuming Kaylee sidles up to him

KAYLEE
Dont mind the Captain none
Simon I know hell look out for
her

SIMON
Its amazing I bring River all
the way out to the raggedy edge of
the verse so she can hide from
the Alliance by robbing banks

KAYLEE
Its just a little Trading
Station Theyll be back fore
you can spit
(as he stalks off)
Not that you spit
Kaylee watches him go a tad forlorn

EXT LILAC - DAY

We see the town sprawled before us as the mule heads in

The town embodies the lives of folk out here

adobe and wood

mix with metal and plastic -- whatevers on hand to build

with Right now the streets are mainly empty

EXT TRADING STATION - CONTINUING

The mule pulls up Zoe hitching it as they speak

Mal turns

JAYNE
What are we hoping to find here
that equals the worth of a turd

MAL
Alliance payroll Theres peace
enforcing squads stationed all
about this quadrant Cant use
credits out here -- they got to
pay their boys in cashy money
Which once a month rests here

ZOE
Something about stealing from the
Alliance just warms a body like
whiskey in winter

JAYNE
(cocks his gun)
Shiny Lets be badguys

back to River

MAL
You ready to go to work darlin

RIVER
Theres no pattern to the pebbles
here theyre completely random
I tried to count them but you
drove too fast Hummingbird

MAL
(never mind)
Right Great Lets go

INT TRADING STATION - DAY

We are in a cameras eye view right above the door

The door slams open Mal and Jayne stride in Zoe following
and whipping her hogleg right at camera without looking
Reverse to see the camera is also a small screen with
Welcome to Lilac on it for the millisecond before its
blown to bits

Theres maybe fifteen people in the place store workers
farm-folk and a couple dirt-poor kids Its a combination
post-office general store bank and most other things

MAL
Hands and knees and heads bowed
down Everybody now

Two men who appear to be farm folk rush Mal and the others
Mal draws on the elder one and he stops dead in his tracks
Mals gun is long not unlike Civil War era issue but very
much new in design

The other tries to tackle Jayne which is not necessarily a
great idea Jayne clotheslines him so hard he spins right

upside-down -- and Jayne grabs him by the legs and CRACK --
bounces his head right off the floor knocking him out cold

MAL
(continuing)
Yall wanna be looking very
intently at your own belly
buttons I see a head start to
rise violence is gonna ensue

The guy who rushed Mal complies along with everyone else
Jayne dumps his catch on the floor and rips open his dirty
shirt to reveal the purple of an Alliance uniform

JAYNE
Looks like this is the place

He looks up at Mal who motions for Zoe to open the front
door She does and River steps in

ANGLE RIVERS BARE FEET -- walking slowly among the hunched-
over customers as Mal addresses them

MAL
Youve probably guessed we mean to
be thieving here but what we are
after is not yours So lets have
no undue fussing

As he is speaking Jayne is scrambling to the back office
finding the small vault locked

JAYNE
Shes locked up

River suddenly looks around perturbed
CLOSE ON a young tough

River looks up at Zoe alarmed and silently points to the
young man He is slowly reaching for the weapon in his belt

He finds Zoes sawed-off nuzzling his cheek

ZOE
You know what the definition of a
hero is Its someone who gets
other people killed You can look
it up later

He drops his weapon slides it across the floor

Mal moves to the Trade Agent Hauls him up tosses him
toward the vault Zoe and Jayne follow

TRADE AGENT
This is just a crop moon dont
think youll find what you --

MAL
(in Chinese)
Shut up and make us wealthy

The old man punches in the code What opens is a tiny wall
safe Bundles of bills some scattered coin Unimpressive
Jayne and Zoe are behind the captain peering in

ZOE
At last We can retire and give
up this life of crime

Mal reaches in pulls a lever and the floor opens a six foot
hole appearing stairs leading to a corridor all gleaming
metal and blue light Zoe smiles Jayne peers down as Mal
addresses the Trade Agent

MAL
Is there a fed down there Be
truthful

TRADE AGENT
(nodding)
Yall are Browncoats hey Fought
for independence

MAL
Wars long done Were all just
folk now
(calls down)
Listen up We are coming down to
empty that vault

The voice of a young Alliance GUARD comes up from below
GUARD (0S)

You have to give me your
authorization password

Jayne impatiently fires a burst of machine-gun fire down into
the hole A beat

GUARD (0S)
(continuing)
Okay
Mal looks at Zoe and they head down into
INT VAULT - CONTINUING

Which is as modern as something off the Central Planets A
short corridor leads to a real vault door that the guard is
already opening Behind that door a few bags of the real
deal neatly stacked cash waiting to be robbed

INT TRADING STATION - CONTINUING

We move in on River as something crosses her face Worry

EXT TOWN - DAY

A WOMAN carrying a bucket and her nine year old SON are
looking at the trading station a few buildings away

SON
Repeater

WOMAN
Did sound summat like gunblast
Maybe you aught run tell Lawman
She turns and right by her in the shadows is a man
Mostly He is hideously disfigured a combination of self-
mutilation and the bubbling red of radiation poisoning His
clothes are rags his eyes pinpoints of glazed madness

A blade blurs through frame

INT TRADING STATION - CONTINUING

-River SCREAMS and flops onto her back pinned by revelation
Others look at her concerned as Jayne makes his way to her

JAYNE
What the hell is up You all
right Whats goin on

He holds her as she whispers wide-eyed

RIVER
Reavers

INT VAULT - MOMENTS LATER

Zoe is hauling out the last of five bags as Mal talks to the
guard holding his gun at him

MAL
Legs good itll bleed plenty and
we avoid any necessary organs

GUARD
I was thinking more of a graze

MAL
Well you dont want it to look
like you just gave up

JAYNE (0S)

(to himself)
Every heist hes gotta start
yelling my name --

JAYNE
(barreling in)
Mal Reavers The girls
pitchin a fit Theyre here or
theyre comin soon

He is already loading up with bags as Mal thinks quickly

MAL
(to Zoe and Jayne)
Get on the mule
(to the guard
pointing to the
vault)
Does that open from the inside

GUARD
Whah -ah- yes

MAL
You get everyone upstairs in there
and you seal it Long as you got
air you dont open up you
understand

GUARD
I -- Buh I --

Mal is in his face dark and huge

MAL
GET THEM INSIDE THE VAULT

EXT TRADING STATION - DAY

The doors burst open Jayne and Zoe coming out first Mal
behind with River in hand She is freaked in her own space
Jayne and Zoe throw the bags on --

MAL
Zoe take the wheel --

JAYNE
You see ‘em Anybody see em

-- and jump on themselves Mal scanning the area as he hands
River up to Jaynes care As the craft powers up slowly
moving the young man Zoe kept from trying to pull his weapon
bursts out of the station grabbing the back of the mule

YOUNG MAN
Take me with you

MAL
Get in the vault with the others --

YOUNG MAN
I cant stay here Please

MAL
Its too many Drive Zoe

A Reaver craft ROARS over their heads Its nearly the size
of Serenity Torn apart belching smoke -- a welded
conglomeration of ruined ships painted for war Predator
pure It disappears over the rooftops

YOUNG MAN
PLEASE

MAL
Drive

Zoes face is set with unhappy determination as she floors
it shooting out and leaving the young man in the dust

As they move from him four Reavers jump out of the shadows
and grab the young man Mal unhesitatingly draws his gun
He nudges a lever with his thumb and a cartridge pops back

Mal fires twice The young man takes both bullets in the
chest slumps down dead

ANGLE THE EDGE OF TOWN

As the mule shoots past the last building we see a skiff
shoot out from behind the buildings of the adjacent street
right abreast of our gang

ANGLE THE CENTER OF TOWN

We see the church as the first ship and an even larger one
come to hover over it Reavers dropping down on cable lines
to swarm into it

EXT DESERT - CONTINUING

The mule and the skiff are booking through the rocky terrain
The skiff swings closer but Jayne peppers it with automatic
fire and it swings away There is sporadic return fire

JAYNE
How come they aint blowing us out
of the air

MAL
They wanna run us down The up-
close kill

River is squashed down on her back being very small

RIVER
They want us alive when they eat
us

JAYNE

Boy sure would be nice if we had
some grenades dontchya think

Mal says nothing keeps firing

ZOE
Wash baby can you hear me

INT SERENITY BRIDGE - CONTINUING
Wash is in a frenzy of switchflipping prepping for take-off

WASH
Were moments from air You got
somebody behind you

We intercut Wash and Zoe at this point
EXT DESERT - CONTINUING

ZOE
Reavers

WASH
(blanching)
merciless hell

ZOE
Were not gonna reach you in time

WASH
Just keep moving honey Were
coming to you
EXT SERENITY - CONTINUING
As she lifts off and starts heading toward the others
EXT DESERT - CONTINUING

Zoe gets the mule in front but a harpoon thwinngs through the
air from the skiff and SHHNNK Goes through Jaynes leg The
harpoon grips the leg and pulls --

Jayne goes flying off the back of the Mule Mal just grabbing
him as the harpoon line reels slowly tighter --

MAL
Grab on

Jayne grabs the Mule legs dangling pulled out between the
two vessels as Mal slams a new cartridge into his pistol

JAYNE
I wont get et You shoot me if
they take me

Mal steadies himself and takes aim seemingly at Jayne --
JAYNE

(continuing)
Well dont shoot me first

Mal fires Again Steadies himself for one more
‘The line holding the harpoon is split by Mals third shot

The mule surges forward as Jayne drags on the ground Mal
hauls him in as River bounds into the front to make room

JAYNE
(continuing)
Rutting pigs Wheres --
And River is holding out his weapon before he can ask for it
EXT ANOTHER PART OF THE DESERT - CONTINUING

Serenity rushes across the desert floor not much higher off
it than the smaller crafts

WASH
(to Zoe)
Get some distance on em You come
to the flats I want you to swing
round Gonna try a Barn Swallow

INT BRIDGE - CONTINUING
Wash hits the com

WASH
Simon Open the loading dock

INT CARGO BAY - CONTINUING

Simon moves next to the huge sliding doors at the front hits
a couple of buttons The doors pull open as the huge ramp
beyond them opens down letting in a rush of wind and light

EXT DESERT - CONTINUING
The mule reaches the flats away from the rocks
WASH (0S)
(in Zoes ear)
Okay baby weve talked this
through

ZOE
Talkin aint doin’

She throws the wheel and the mule comes hard about
fishtailing slightly as it faces the oncoming skiff

WASH (0S)
Dont stow down

ANGLE THE SKIFF
As it heads for the mule --
ANGLE THE MULE

As it heads for the skiff -- and Serenity swoops down out of
the sky bay doors open and comes right up behind it -- The
Mule swallowed by the bigger ship --

INT CARGO BAY - CONTINUING

And only its forward momentum keeps it from being squashed as
it flies backwards into the bay narrowly missing Simon and
smashing back into the staircase sparks and people flying --

EXT DESERT - CONTINUING

Serenity tries to get altitude -- but slams right into the
oncoming skiff tearing it apart --

INT CARGO BAY - CONTINUING

A flaming portion of the top flies in skids to the floor as
small fires erupt from the mule as well -- Simon pulls a
lever and jets of CO2 shoot out of the floor

Simon hits the button to start the outer ramp closing then
runs to the mule The CO2 stops and he finds River sitting
in her seat completely unharmed Zoe is climbing painfully
out of the other seat Mal and Jayne both having been thrown

SIMON
River

RIVER
I swallowed a bug

Kaylee runs in to see how everyone is She goes to Simon

KAYLEE
Are you okay

MAL
Is he okay

A bloodied Reaver POPS into frame from under the skiff-top
He lunges for Mal baring sharpened teeth --

Mal spins and draws fires into his belly as Jayne and Zoe
both fire at the same time The freak takes too long to go
down but down he goes Dies sitting against the skiff top —

Everybody takes a moment to look at each other
WASH (0S)
We all here Whats going on

MAL

Simon suddenly punches him in the face causing Mal to
stumble back and Simon to shake his hand in pain

MAL
(continuing)
You wanna bullet You wanna
bullet right in your throat

SIMON
You stupid selfish son of a
whore ---

MAL

Im a hairs breadth from riddling

SIMON

SIMON

MAL

SIMON

KAYLEE

RIVER
He didnt lie down They never

She is looking at the Reaver Everyone does
INT FOREDECK HALL - MOMENTS LATER
Mal and Zoe enter from below

ZOE
No I think thingsll glide a deal
smoother for us without River and
Simon on board but how long do
you think theyll last

MAL
Doc made his call Theys as
babes in a basket when we took ‘em
in we sheltered em plenty Man
has to cut loose learn to stand
on his own

ZOE
Like that man back in town

They stop by Mals room

MAL
I had to shoot him What the
Reavers woulda done to him before
they killed him

for a moment

ZOE
I know That was a piece a
mercy But before that him
begging us to bring him along

MAL
We couldnt take the weight
Woulda slowed us down

ZOE
You know that for certain --

MAL
Mule wont run with five I
shoulda dumped the girl Or you

Or Jayne
(considering)
Well Jayne

ZOE
Coulda tossed the payload

MAL
And go to Fanty and Mingo with air
in our mitts tell ‘em heres
your share Theyd set the dogs
on us in the space of a twitch
and there we are back in mortal
peril We get a job we gotta
make good

Wash enters from the bridge

ZOE
Sir I dont disagree on any
particular point its just in

the time of war we woulda never
left a man stranded

MAL
Maybe thats why we lost

Shes not happy with the reply Mal climbs down to his room
as Wash reaches Zoe slides his arms around her

INT MALS ROOM - CONTINUING
Once alone Mal lets his own disappointment show He pulls
off his holster and drops it over a chair Kicks the toilet

closed and sits on his bunk

The place resembles a submarine cabin with charts and
clutter ancient maps on the walls

Mal moves a bunch of papers off his bunk and a picture slides
out Hits the floor and starts moving its a snapshot-movie
of

INT INARAS SHUTTLE - DAY

Were close on a beautiful woman who looks at us with amused
exasperation Behind her is an opulently dressed little
shuttle

INARA
Kaylee are you ever gonna put
that capture down

KAYLEE (0S)
We gotta have records of
everything A bona fide Companion
entertained clients on this very
ship In this very bed

The picture pans over to the bed -- which River is bending
over and sniffing curiously Inara is packing things up

KAYLEE (0S)
(continuing)
For one sweet second we was
almost classy

INARA
You promised to help me pack

KAYLEE (0S)
Honest Inara why do you have to
leave

Inara shoots an uncertain look at the camera -- and the
picture freezes goes back to the beginning

During all this Mal has picked it up He looks at it a
Moment tosses it aside Looks around at nothing much

JAYNE (VO)
I do not get it Hows a guy get
so wrong
INT CARGO BAY - LATER

We see the doors in the floor slide open a second set below
Pan to see for a moment the dead Reavers face

Kaylee is opening the doors with a keypad on a cable Jayne
drags the corpse closer to the doors as he continu€St
JAYNE
Aint logical Cuttin on his own
face rapin and murdering -- I

mean Ill kill a man in a fair
fight or if I think hes gonna
start a fair fight or if he
bothers me or if theres a woman

or Im gettin paid -- mostly only
when Im gettin paid But these
Reavers last ten years they

just show up like the boageyman
from stories Eating people
alive Where does that get fun

He dumps the body in she starts the doors closing

KAYLEE
Shepherd Book said they was men
that reached the edge of space
saw a vasty nothingness and just
went bibbledy over it

JAYNE
Hell I been to the edge Just
looked like more space

KAYLEE
I dont know People get awful
lonely in the black Like to get
addlepated ourselves we stay on
this boat much longer Captainll
drive us all off one by one

JAYNE
Youre just in a whinge cuz that
prissy doc is finally
disembarking Me I says good
riddance He never belonged here
and his sisters no saner than one
of them Reavers

KAYLEE
That aint even so Rivers a
dear heart and a boon to this
crew You just dont like her
‘cause she can read your mind and
everything you think is mean

JAYNE
Well there is that

KAYLEE
Her and Simon could have a place
here Now theyre leaving us
dust like Shepherd Book

She looks up toward one of the shuttles

KAYLEE
(continuing)
Just like Inara

INT COMPANION TRAINING HOUSE - DAY

And here she is moving back and down into frame her eyes
half closed in passion She settles on a cluster of brocaded
pillows and we see another head lowering in for a kiss

Come around to see its another lovely young woman -- and
that there is a group of ten others watching intently all in
saris on their knees Two handsome young men with shaved
heads in the back also on their knees

Inara stops before the kiss smiling and coming back up She
speaks to the girls (We hear only soft music) as she
repositions the one shes with lowering again showing her
the motion of surrender as if it were a dance step

A WOMANS VOICE (V0)
They love you

EXT COMPANION TRAINING HOUSE - DUSK

Inara looks out at the mountains The space shes in
resembles a Tibetan monastery if slightly more opulent

Widen to see she is with SHEYDRA a somewhat older Companion
the woman whose voice we heard She hands Inara a drink

SHEYDRA
The girls Theyve learned more
from you these last months than
the rest of us could show them in
two years

INARA
Theyre very sweet But theyre
not Companions

SHEYDRA
(wryly)
Youve no hope for them Junk the
lot start anew

INARA
On Sihnon we started training at
twelve Years of discipline and
preparation before the physical
act of pleasure was even
mentioned Most of these girls --

SHEYDRA
Theyre all of good family the
highest academic standards --

INARA
Control Was the first lesson
And the last and these worlds are
not like the Central Planets
There is barbarism dressed up in
the most civil weeds Men of the
highest rank who dont know the
difference between a Companion and
a common whore Its unsafe

SHEYDRA
All the more reason the girls look
to you You came out here alone
before the Alliance ever thought
to establish a House this remote
Youve seen so much Youre a
figure of great romance to them

INARA
Great romance has nothing to do
with being a Companion Sheydra
You should know better

SHEYDRA
Im not the one who had a torrid
affair with a pirate

Inara nearly spills her drink

INARA
A who With a what

SHEYDRA
(smiling)
Its the talk of the House The
girls all trade stories in the
dorms at night

INARA
I didnt have a pirate

SHEYDRA
In one of the stories you make
love in a burning temple I think
thats my favorite

INARA

(sitting)
This is unbearable Captain
Reynolds is no pirate hes a
petty thief And he never laid a
finger on me All he ever did was
rent me a shuttle and be very
annoying

(mutters in Chinese)
A switch to those girls
backsides is just good enough

SHEYDRA
A year on his shuttle and he never
laid a finger on you No wonder
you left

INARA
(bridling)
I left because -- go away Were
no longer friends Youre a
stranger to me now

SHEYDRA
I do love to watch you boil
Dont worry The stories will
fade And your Captain Reynolds
has probably gotten himself blown
up by this time

INARA
(looking away again)
Yes That would be just like him

EXT BEAUMONDE ATOLL PLAZA - EVENING

Serenity touches down on the crowded atoll amidst a number of
other equally disreputable ships

every kind of immigrant culture and shop imaginable

EXTINT SERENITY - EVENING

The ramp is open and everyone is filing out ready to hit the

Kaylee is talking to Simon who has River in hand

KAYLEE
Dont talk to the barkers -- only

The place is filled with

KAYLEE (contd)
You look the captain in the eye

SIMON

Since he doesnt know what to say she rattles on

KAYLEE

She turns and heads off Simon starts in the other
direction but River looks after her and the others

SIMON
(continuing)
River do you want to stay with
them
RIVER

SIMON
No I fear its not safe anymore

Hes heading off and doesnt hear

RIVER
For them

INT THE MAIDENHEAD - CONTINUING

We start on a CorVue screen showing a news report On the
screen is a shot of the town our gang robbed now half of it
a smoking ruin

down)

MAL

You knew he was gonna leave We

those two And how do you know
what he feels Hes got River to
worry on but he still coulda shown
you if I truly wanted someone
bad enough wouldnt be a thing in
the ‘verse could stop me from
going to her

KAYLEE
Tell that to Inara

For a moment Mal is too shocked to react

MINGO
Domestic troubles

Kaylee storms out

MINGO is young tough -- somewhere between a gangster and a
fur-trader Sounds lower-class British or

FANTY
Domestic troubles

something like it

FANTY moves out from behind Mingo to reveal that he is

Mingos identical twin

dress

MINGO
Cause we dont wanna interrupt

FANTY
A man should keep his house in
order

MAL
(greets them each)
Mingo Fanty

Apart from slight differences in
they are indistinguishable
MINGO
(pointing at his
brother)
Hes Mingo

MAL
Hes Fanty Youre Mingo

MINGO

Ghahh How is it you always know

MAL
Fantys prettier
(pulling out a chair)
Feel to do some business

MINGO
(re Mals gang)
Bit crowded isnt it As you

see we come unencumbered by thugs

MAL

Which means at least four of the

guys already in here are yours

Alls one Ill just keep Jayne

with me

ZOE
Sir are you sure you dont --

MAL
Go Go get yourselves a nice
romantic meal

WASH
Those are my two favorite words
(to Zoe)
Honey Meal

MAL
(to Zoe)
Its business Were fine

They leave and the four remaining men sit

Fanty tosses a

few coins to a saloon-girl who does a little fan-dance

ANGLE THE CORVUE CAMERAS POV of the men is conveniently

blocked by her little dance

Mals foot nudges a duffel bag of money to Mingos foot

MINGO
Quite a crew youve got

MAL
Yeah theyre a fine bunch of
ruebens

MINGO

How you keep them on that crap
boat is the subject of much musing
tween me and Fanty

FANTY
We go on and on

MAL
So Im noticing Is there a
problem I dont know of You got
25 of a sweet take kissing your
foot how come were not
dispersing

FANTY
Our end is forty precious

JAYNE
My muscular buttocks its forty --

MINGO
It is as of now Find anyone
around going cheaper

FANTY
Find anyone around going near a
sorry lot like you in the first
instance

ANGLE RIVER has entered is looking about

Jayne sees her nudges Mal who looks and turns back to
business We stay on her as she wanders around the perimeter
of the bar vaguely listening in on Mals deal

FANTY

(continuing)
Youre unlikable Mal You got no
respect for us above you you got
enemies in every quadrant and
your ships older than the
starting point of time Yous
charity cases to such as us

MAL
Well heres a foul thought I
conjured you two were incompetent
sent us out not knowing there were
Reavers about Now Im thinking
you picked us out because you did

MINGO
That were a sign of faith boy
And it doesnt affect our forty
per Danger is after all your

business

JAYNE
Reavers aint business double
dickless

This is all background noise to River who has moved to the
Cv screen on which is a commercial Its animated goofy
cartoon animals and anime-style Asian girls all transforming
to insane fantasy figures as they sing about

COMMERCIAL
FRUITY OATY BARS POW HEY FRUITY
BARS MAKE A MAN OF A MOUSE MAKE
YOU BUST OUT YOUR BLOUSE EAT THEM
NOW BANG PING ZOW -- TRY
FRUITY OATY BARS

We push in the light from the CV on Rivers face pushing to
EXTREME CLOSE UP all noise but the jingle fading out
finally that as well just the hum in Rivers ears

And she whispers

RIVER
Miranda

She turns and looks back at the crowd
What happens next happens very fast
She strides silently to the first table -- two men drinking
quietly -- and she slams her foot into ones face then whips
it back into the others knocking them both unconscious as --
-- people are turning just registering that this girl --
-- kicks the table into a card player even as she sweeps a
bottle off it behind her -- the bottle hits a man behind her

square in the face a man she never even looked at -- people
are rising fleeing or pushing forward --

MAL
River

JAYNE
Whuhuh

Shes taking out a group of four high kicks and perfect
precision -- Two men come from either side one whipping out
a knife -- she does a perfect split grabs his wrist above
her head using his momentum to stab the other one --

Mal fights to get back to the gunrack The bouncer reaches

her and she wrests his shockrod from him uses it on him on
Fanty and Mingo -- the fan-dancer is bolting and River hurls
the rod at her head knocks her cold

Shes everywhere On tables chairs under your legs using
the room itself to take out every single person there One
man hides behind a wall -- impossibly she swings her leg
around the corner and nails his face

Jayne grabs her from behind --

JAYNE
(continuing)
Gorrammit girl its me

She grabs his crotch and squeezes -- his grip loosens and she
spins facing him and flat-heels his nose with her palm

twirling into a gut kick that doubles him over dispatching
of another while she cracks Jaynes head with a small table --

Somebody pulls a gun and she snaps his elbow causing him to
scream out even before he shoots himself in the gut --

Mal frantically wrests a gun from the vending locker as River
knocks the other guys gun in the air kicks someone else and
then catches it whips it around just as Mal comes up with
his they are pointed right at each other --

SIMON
Eta Kooram Nah Smech

And River drops to the ground fast asleep

There is a beat Mal looks around the bar He and Simon
who has run up to the entrance are the only ones standing

He looks down at River She lies unconscious helpless

MAL
I think maybe we ought to leave

EXT SPACE - NIGHT

We see two sleek warships glide silently into frame followed
by a third bigger ship This is the Operatives vessel and
it is everything Serenity is not sleek predatory icy cool

INT THE OPERATIVES SHIP - BRIDGE - CONTINUING

The Operative is looking at the Maidenhead security feed --
and River is staring right at him

gets knocked out by a ninety pound
girl ‘Cause I dont think thats

ZOE
Do we know if anyone was killed

MAL
Its likely I know she meant to
kill me ‘fore the Doc put her to
sleep which how exactly does that
work anyhow

SIMON

Safeword

(beat)
The people who helped me break
River out -- they had intel that
River and the other subjects were
being embedded with behavioral
conditioning They taught me a
safeword in case something
happened

KAYLEE
Not sure I get it

SIMON
A phrase thats encoded in her
brain that makes her fall asleep
If I speak the words Eta --

JAYNE
(jumping back)
Well dont say it

ZOE

It only works on her Jayne
JAYNE

Oh Well now I know that
MAL

In case something happened
SIMON

MAL

You feel to elaborate on what that
something might be I mean they
taught you that fancy safeword
they mustve figured she was
gonna what -- start
uncontrollably crocheting

SIMON
They never said what --

MAL
And you never did ask

Mal grabs him and throws him against the wall in his face

MAL
(continuing)
Eight months Eight months you
had her on my boat knowing full

Inside we find an unkempt young man Also sleep-deprived
over-caffeinated and kinda sweet This is MR UNIVERSE He
is alone but for his mannikin-like Love-bot Lenore

Hes surrounded by screens computers feeds -- machinery
that looks both ultra-modern and long neglected All the
screens play different images -- its a mediaverse

INT BRIDGE - CONTINUING

As he watches the security feed of Rivers fight his image
becomes a vidscreen Hes addressing Wash Mal and Zoe

We intercut between the two spaces

MR UNIVERSE

men and Im having a catharsis

violence You think youre ina

truth of the signal what I see

Parliaments jesters foist on the
somnambulant public Monkey taught

a commitment to my Lovebot it was

a baby a hungry angry baby

(re screen)
And she falls asleep Which she
would be sleepy

MAL
Can you go back See if anybody
spoke with her ‘fore she acted up
made any kind of contact with
her

Mr Universe works the screen The image rewinds and stops on
River coming up to it looking at it She whispers the word
Miranda and starts to move away

MAL
(continuing)
Miranda Go back further

MR UNIVERSE
No

He pulls another screen close starts working that one
Matching timecodes he pulls up the commercial

MAL
Um please

Mr Universe has a third screen showing the commercial as
well -- and it starts breaking down bursts of (non-matrixy)
code showing through As he does so

MR UNIVERSE
Friends and potential lovers I

other kind Good is youre very
smart Someone is talking to her

WASH

INT STORAGE LOCKER - NIGHT

River stares at us impassive as the camera pulls away from
her to reveal Simon who is cleaning blood off her face

RIVER
Theyre afraid of me
SIMON

She starts tearing up breathing faster Simon runs his

SIMON

almost uncontrollably screaming in his face

EXT MINING CAMP - DAY

We see the camp a few shacks and a working mine as our
group come down to it greeted by a few miners including an
eight year old boy that rushes to Kaylee

ANGLE ON A CANNON mounted at the edge of town The guy
manning it sees them arrive also goes to greet them

INT COMMUNITY KITCHEN - NIGHT

We see the gang sitting and eating Comfortable even
laughing a bit Jayne presents Book with a couple of cigars
Kaylee hoists the boy on her lap

INT STORAGE LOCKER - NIGHT

As he continues we see an image of him watching over the
sleeping girl his mind racing

MAL (0S)

reason in the verse to leave her
lay and haul anchor

EXT MINING CAMP - CONTINUING

BOOK

Theyll come at you sideways

As he continues we see
EXT COMPANION TRAINING HOUSE - DAY

Inara stands waiting her back to us in front of the very
vista we first saw her before

The Operative comes slowly up the staircase stands before

Eight-year-old River is working away not paying attention

TEACHER

River you look tired I think

INT MALS ROOM - CONTINUING

INARA
Oh Thank you I I guess we

With the locals I thought maybe

MAL
You could use a gun hand

INARA
Im hoping not But if you were
close at all you -- the crew --

while and thered be payment

MAL
Payment is never not a factor I
could sound out the crew This

pot like to boil over soon

INARA
Soon Not right away

MAL
Well it would be I mean I would
like to Kaylees been missing

INT BRIDGE - CONTINUING

There is a general groan among the audience which now
includes Kaylee as well

KAYLEE
Oh theyre so pathetic

INT MALS ROOM - CONTINUING

INARA
I miss her too I even miss my
shuttle occasionally

MAL
Yeah you left a got some of
your stuff in a trunk never did

INARA
Oh

Inara smiles blandly nods An awkward beat

MAL
(continuing)
Well its kind of late where Im

She disappears Mal thinks a moment
INT BRIDGE - MOMENTS LATER

Mal comes up in buttoning his shirt

WASH
Inara Nice to see her again
ZOE

MAL
Trap
ZOE

MAL
It aint but a few hours out

WASH
Yeah but remember the part where

MAL
If thats the case then Inaras

KAYLEE
How can you be sure Inara dont

EXT SERENITY - DAY
The ship moves gracefully over the mountains
INT BRIDGE - CONTINUING

WASH
Were about seventy miles from the
Training house And nobody on
radar if the Alliance is about
theyre laying low

MAL
Theyre about Find us a home
Ill take the shuttle in closer
Zoe ship is yours

He starts out turns back to Zoe

MAL
(continuing)
Remember if anything happens to
me or you dont hear from me
within the hour you take this
ship and you come and rescue me

ZOE
What And risk my ship

MAL
(exiting)
I mean it Its cold out there
I dont wanna get left

EXT SERENITY - DAY

She is nestled in a gorge overhanging rocks all but burying
her from view The shuttle on the right lifts off from the
side of the ship and glides off keeping low

EXT COMPANION TRAINING HOUSE - DAY

A line of young trainees files by in robes and red shawls
pulled over their heads -- one trainee a good deal larger
than the others

INT INARAS ROOM - LATER

She is kneeling in front of a statue of Buddha lighting a
few incense sticks

The room is sparsely lush -- not as opulent as the shuttle
where she entertained men but still beautifully furnished
and draped A lace curtain hangs in front of the light
casting its pattern in shadow over everything Including the
rather large figure in a red shawl who kneels beside Inara

MAL
Dear Buddha please send me a
pony and a plastic rocket and --

INARA
Mal What are you doing here

MAL
You invited me

INARA
I never thought for a second youd
be stupid enough to come

MAL
Well that makes you kind of a
tease doesnt it

INARA
You knew my invitation wasnt on
the level --

MAL
Which led me to the conclusion
that you must be in some trouble

INARA
Im fine Im giddy

MAL
For a woman schooled in telling
men what they wanna hear you
aint much of a liar

INARA
Mal you cannot handle this man

THE OPERATIVE
(entering)
I have to say Im impressed that
you would come for her yourself
And that you would make it this
far in that outfit

MAL
(standing)
I can be very graceful when I need
to

THE OPERATIVE
Ive no doubt

Mal sheds his shawl and robe Inara kneels at the alter
picks out another incense stick

MAL
What are you doing

INARA
Im praying for you Mal

THE OPERATIVE
Thats very thoughtful But I
mean it when I say youre not in
any danger

MAL
Speak your piece

THE OPERATIVE
I think youre beginning to
understand how dangerous River Tam
is

MAL
She is a mite unpredictable Mood
swings of a sort

THE OPERATIVE
Its worse than you know

MAL
It usually is

THE OPERATIVE
That girl will rain destruction
down on you and your ship Shes
an albatross Captain
MAL
Way I remember it albatross was
a ships good luck til some
idiot killed it
(to Inara)
Yes Ive read a poem Try not to

faint

The Operative moves further into the room Whenever he
moves Mal counters

THE OPERATIVE
Ive seen your war record I know
how you must feel about the
Alliance

MAL
You really dont

THE OPERATIVE
Fair to say But I have to hope
you understand you cant beat us

MAL
I got no need to beat you I just
wanna go my way

THE OPERATIVE
And you can do that once you let
me take the girl back home Give
me the opportunity to help you

MAL
All I gotta do is let you take one
more thing away from me Ive had
a lot of things taken in my time
And it may just be that this is
one too many

THE OPERATIVE
This psychotic potentially
murderous girl who cant have the
slightest awareness of your
protection This is where you
draw the line

MAL
Well Im a whimsical soul

THE OPERATIVE
Theres a number of lives that
hang in the balance here Lives
under your care Are they as
whimsical as yourself

The Operative is stopped by this

Mal pulls
around it

Mal smiles -- then glares at Inara mouthing Hey

MAL
I got no notion that Im being
heroical at all Any more than I
think youre really just a
harmless bureaucrat come to help
me out You move like a killer

THE OPERATIVE
I have a warship in deep orbit
Captain We locked on to
Serenitys pulse beacon the moment
you hit atmo I can speak a word
and send a missile to that exact
location inside of three minutes

Unhappily he continues

a small device clipped wires sticking out all

and tosses it to the Operative

MAL
You do that best make peace with
your dear and fluffy lord

THE OPERATIVE
Pulse beacon

MAL
Advice from an old tracker you
wanna find someone use your eyes

THE OPERATIVE
How long do you think you can
really run from us

MAL
Oh a jack-rabbit me ‘Sides I
never credited the Alliance with
an over-abundance of brains And
if youre the best they got

THE OPERATIVE
Captain Reynolds I should tell
you so that you dont waste your
time You cant make me angry

INARA

Oh please Spend an hour with him

THE OPERATIVE
I need her Captain River is
my purpose and I will gather her
to me The brother as well
Whatever else happens is
incidental In the greater scheme

MAL
Why is it that the greater scheme
always makes everything not that
great

THE OPERATIVE
I want to resolve this like
civilized men Im not
threatening you Im unarmed

MAL
Great

He draws and shoots the Operative in the chest The
Operative goes down as Mal grabs Inara moves for the’ doorway

The Operative is on him in a second choke-hold from behind

THE OPERATIVE
I am of course wearing full body
armor Im not a moron

He tosses Mal hard against a wall spinning and blocking a
blow from Inara -- she is clearly trained in martial arts
but he flat-heels her to the ground within seconds

Mal is going for his gun again turning and the Operative
kicks him in the face sends him back gun flying Mal gets
to his feet and they square off Mal breathing hard nose
dripping blood The Operative perfectly poised waiting

MAL
No back up Were making an awful
ruckus

THE OPERATIVE
Theyll come when theyre needed

MAL
Id start whistling

THE OPERATIVE
Captain what do you think is
going to happen here

They come at each other The Operative is the much better
trained -- hes fluid his blows sparse and deadly

Mal is more bluster and determination and the Operatives
precision is wearing Mal down

Mal punches wild -- the Operative counters with a spin-kick
to the head that sends Mal to the ground not far from Inara
breathing hard He tries to rise again painfully but Inara
places her hand on his arm

The Operative goes to his briefcase by the door pulls out
his sword His face has taken on that remote kind of
fascination as he looks at it

THE OPERATIVE
(continuing)
Nothing here is what it seems

INARA
I know

THE OPERATIVE
Hes not the plucky hero The
Alliance isnt some evil empire
This isnt the grand arena

INARA
And thats not incense
He turns to look the incense stick burns away -- rather like
a fuse -- and FLASHES in an explosion of light and sound

Its a flash-bomb The Operative sails back as everything
goes smoky white and the sound dies to a tiny buzz

The Operative tries to get his bearings -- and four armored
soldiers are in his face asking him for orders Mal and
Inara are gone He motions for the men to follow them

THE OPERATIVE
Just a flash bomb Go Go

INT COMPANION TRAINING HOUSE - CONTINUING

Inara leads Mal (who is reholstering his gun) down some steps
and along a corridor The sound is still tinny and weird

MAL
Z had him

INARA
What

MAL
(deafly loud)
I think that I was winning

EXT SIDE OF MOUNTAIN BY MALS SHUTTLE - DAY

Mal and Inara move quickly down the mountain They look to
see that Mals shuttle has four Alliance guards waiting by
it Mal ducks back out of sight pulls a fancy-looking
grenade out of his pocket Pops the top and hurls it over at
the foursome

CLOSE ON THE GRENADE as a series of bars of light go out
one by one counting down --

ALLIANCE SOLDIER
Grenade

Everybody dives for cover The moment they do Mal and Inara
race into the shuttle Mal sweeping up the grenade just as
the last light goes out and nothing happens

One soldier turns to look and Mal shoots him back down as the
door shuts on him and Inara

INT SHUTTLE - CONTINUING
Inara pushes into the pilots seat

INARA
Hang on to something

MAL
You sure you remember how it --

He nearly falls over as

EXT MOUNTAIN RANGE - CONTINUING

The shuttle shoots straight up spinning and heading out
INT SHUTTLE - CONTINUING

Inara stares straight ahead relaxing her grip on the
controls Mal is gone

INARA
I told you to hang on

MAL (0S)
(in great pain)
Im fine
EXT SPACE - LATER

We are below Serenity as her bay doors are closing six
little objects floating out of her belly like roe

These objects are roughly the size of pony-kegs and clearly
home-made parts welded together almost haphazardly They
all spark silently to life -- and shoot off in six different
directions as Serenity herself fires up her Firefly effect
and burns away from us

INT COMPANION TRAINING HOUSE - DAY
The Operative sips tea and rubs his temple

THE OPERATIVE
(into a com)
Forget the pulse beacon there has
to be another way to track the
ship -- get a read on the nav sat
Its a registered transport you
must be able to locate --

ENSIGN (0S)
Sir

THE OPERATIVE
Have you found a nav sat
trajectory

ENSIGN (0S)
Sir weve found seven

The Operative looks more unhappy than angry
THE OPERATIVE
(to himself)
Does he think this is a game

EXT CLASSROOM - DAY

The teacher and students sleep as River -- as we saw her in
the institute older with blood seeping from the needle-
holes in her head -- makes her way through them

Slowly she walks to the floating lecture screen On it is
the solar system glowing lines connecting all the stars and
planets She becomes wide-eyed breathing hard as it pushes
in to one system one planet

She looks over to one side of the tent and we see
INT LAB - CONTINUING

Her POV is of the lab There stand some five older men in
formal dress They stare at her impassive

We see flashes of corpses lying in houses in city
streets -- and a Reavers screaming face --

INT STORAGE LOCKER - DAY

And River awakens A moment to get her bearings then her
eyes narrow with intent

INARA (VO)
We have every reason to be afraid

INT PASSENGER DORM - CONTINUING

JAYNE
Why ‘cause this guy beat up Mal
That aint so hard --

MAL
He didnt beat me up --

INARA
Because hes a believer

INT THE OPERATIVES SHIP A DARK CABIN

As Inara continues we see Fanty and Mingo tied to chairs
Light spills onto their bruised faces as the Operative enters

INARA (V0O)
Hes intelligent methodical and
devout in his belief that killing
River is the right thing to do

INT PASSENGER DORM - CONTINUING

INARA
I honestly think the only reason
we havent been blown out of the
air is that he needs to see her

SIMON
Needs to see her why

INARA
Im uncertain I would say to be
sure of the kill but I just
know hell kill us all to get to
her

JAYNE

So no hope of a reward huh

ZOE
Did he mention a deal of any kind

MAL
(looking at Simon)
Give the two of them up Go my
way

JAYNE
Which you was all ready to do not
a day ago What went sour

MAL
Cutting them loose aint the same
as handing them over

JAYNE
That so Cause the corpse Im
about to become is having trouble
telling the difference

SIMON
(to Inara)
Did he say anything about a
Miranda

INARA
What is that

MAL
Dont know who or what but its
on Rivers mind Conjure it might
be the reason hes after her

INARA
You think maybe it poses some kind
of threat to the Alliance

WASH
Do we care Are we caring about
that

JAYNE

You dumbass hogs the only people
shes a threat to is us on this
boat

INT STORAGE LOCKER - CONTINUING

River is near the ceiling keeping herself up in a split
again feet against the walls There is a wire mesh cover to
the light and she has bent part of it out is working it
inside the lock of her shackles
INT PASSENGER DORM - MOMENTS LATER

MAL
Look we get back to Haven in a
few hours time --

JAYNE
Hiding under the Shepherds
skirts thats a manful scheme --

MAL

You wanna run this ship
JAYNE

Yes
MAL

small beat)
Well you cant

JAYNE

Do a damn sight better jobn you
Getting us lashed over a couple of
strays

(to Simon)
No offense Doc I think its
noble as a grape the way you look
to River but she aint my sister

(to Mal)
and she aint your crew Oh and
neither is she exactly helpless
So wheres it writ we gotta lay
down our lives for her which is
what youve steered us toward

MAL
I didnt start this

JAYNE

No the Alliance starts the war --
and then you volunteer Battle of
Serenity Mal besides Zoe here
how many --

(Mal turns away)
-- Im talkin at you -- how many
men in your platoon came out of
there alive

Mal stares at him
ZOE

(dead cold)
You wanna leave this room
JAYNE
Youre damn right I do

He stalks upstairs Theres a quiet moment

INARA
This isnt the war Mal

Mal turns eyeing her

MAL
Are you telling me that because
you think I dont know --

INARA
You came to the training house
looking for a fight

MAL
I came looking for you

INARA
I just want to know who Im
dealing with Ive seen too many
versions of you to be sure

MAL
I start fighting a war I guarantee
youll see something new

Mal walks out into the cargo bay Inara following
SIMON
Well get off River and Ill get
off at Haven and find some --

KAYLEE
Nobodys saying that

WASH
Nobody besides Jayne is saying
that
INT CARGO BAY - CONTINUING

Inara tries to catch up to --

I got no answers for you

Inara

I got no rudder Wind blows

northerly I go north

Thats who

I am Maybe that aint a man to
lead but they have to follow so
you wanna tear me down do it

inside your own mind

INARA

Im not trying to tear you down --

MAL
But you fog things up

You always

have -- you spin me about I wish
like hell you was elsewhere

INARA

INT DINING ROOM - CONTINUING

Jayne is looking at the storage locker door

JAYNE

Enough of this nonsense

A beat

He moves to the aft hall shuts and locks the door Goes
back to the locker and starts to unlock it pulling his gun

JAYNE
(continuing)

No trouble now little crazy
person were going for a nice

shuttle ride --

He opens the door and she is on him in an instant whip blow
to the throat the nose -- he fires wildly as she jumps on
him wraps her arms around his neck and topples him back --

INT AFT HALL - MOMENTS LATER

The crew enters drawn by the shots

Mal is first -- cant

open the door Looks in to see an unconscious Jayne

The other way Find her and do

not engage

Everyone piles out the other way
the window

Simon remains

to look in

ANGLE SIMONS POV There is Jayne not moving -- and River
pops up right in front of us

He starts then waits as she opens the door

SIMON
Its gonna be oka --

She elbows his throat viciously He drops to his knees
shocked and gasping as she spin-kicks him to the ground He
doesnt move She looks at him a moment then takes off

INT CARGO BAY - MOMENTS LATER

Mal is throwing his shoulder against the bolted door to the
upstairs He gives up looking around

ZOE
Shes sealed off the bridge I do
not like her there

KAYLEE
Capn

She tosses him a bolt remover He starts pulling a bolt out
of a panel on the wall tells Zoe

MAL
Check the shuttles She coulda
snuck in

He pops the panel off and starts wriggling in among the wires
INT FOREDECK HALLBRIDGE - LATER

A floor panel hinges open Mal pulling himself up He moves
quietly to the bridge gun drawn

He enters to find River frantically punching up coordinates
on a big Cortex screen shes pulled out by the copilots
seat She whips Jaynes gun at his face never looking at
him A moment and Mal lowers his own gun

MAL
The governments man he says
youre a danger to us Not worth
helping Is he right Are you
anything but a weapon Ive
staked my crews life on the
a- person—— Serra
actual and whole and if Im wrong
youd best shoot me now
(she cocks the gun)
Or we could talk more

RIVER
(pointing to screen)
Miranda

Its a planet Matches the one from her dream
INT BRIDGE - LATER

Everyone has gathered Wash is piloting now as they are in
atmosphere River is by Simon She moves restlessly upset

KAYLEE
How can it be theres a whole
planet called Miranda and none of
us knowed that

MAL
Because there isnt one Its a
blackrock Uninhabitable
Terraforming didnt hold or
somesuch Few settlers died

RIVER
(to Simon)
I had to show them I didnt know
if you were going to make me sleep

SIMON
(hoarse whisper)
You couldve asked

KAYLEE
(re planet)
Wait a tick yeah Some ten years
back before the war There was
call for workers to settle on
Miranda my daddy talked about
going I shouldve recalled

WASH
But theres nothing about it on
the Cortex -- History
Astronomy its not in there
MAL

Half of writing history is hiding
the truth Theres something on
this rock the Alliance doesnt
want known

INARA
Thats right at the edge of the
Burnham Quadrant right

INARA (contd)
Furthest planet out
(Mal nods)
Its not that far from here

WASH
Whoah no no --

ZOE
(moving to the screen)
Thats a bad notion --

WASH
Honey

ZOE
I got it baby

WASH
Show them the bad

She hits some commands on the screen pulls back to reveal a
couple of other planets near Miranda

ZOB
This is us see And heres
Miranda All along here this
dead space in between thats
Reaver territory

WASH
They just float out there sending
out raiding parties --

ZOE
Maybe a hundred ships And more

EXT MINING CAMP - DAY

The ship swings around a mountain to come into view of the
camp

It is a world of fire

Every building burns some blown right apart Bodies litter
the scene not one of them moving Theres a grounded
Alliance ship not far from the cannon that shot it down
INT BRIDGE - CONTINUING

We see Mals face as the sight hits him like a gut-punch
EXT MINING CAMP - MOMENTS LATER

The crew pours out even as the ramp lowers going off in all
directions calling out to people

Kaylee heads for the burning church

KAYLEE
Shepherd Shepherd Book

She stops looking at the ground by the steeple There is
the body on the ground face down The child she played with
at dinner Kaylee stares at first uncomprehending

ANGLE MAL moving in the other direction approaches the
cannon Jayne behind him He stops and sees

Book lying by the cannon torn up badly from the waist down
MAL
(to Jayne)
Get the Doc

He moves to the Shepherd grabs his searching hand

MAL
(continuing)

Shepherd Dont move

BOOK
Wont go far

MAL
Shouldntve been you Im so
sorry it was they shouldve

hit us They shouldve hit me

BOOK
That crossed my mind

I shot him down --

MAL
I seen

BOOK
I killed the ship that killed
us Not very Christian of me
MAL

You did whats right

BOOK
(not unkindly)
Coming from you that means
almost nothing HNAAH Ah Im
long gone

MAL
Doc1l bring you round I look to
be bored by many more sermons

‘fore you slip -- dont move --
BOOK
Cant order me around boy

Im not one of your crew

MAL
Yes you are

Book coughs up blood grabbing Mal Urgent almost angry

BOOK
You its on you now all this
death this shit you have to
find a course This cant mean
nothing River you have to
MAL

Come on keep it up --

Book grabs Mals face talks as though replying to something

BOOK
I dont care what you believe
Just believe it Whatever you

have to
His breathing becomes laboured Hitched

Stopped His hand slips away his blood leaving a distinct
print on Mals face

Jayne and Simon run up Simon slowing down -- going to the
re hes-deadZ
them as Jayne looks around him Mal still fixed on Book

JAYNE
How come they aint waiting They
knowd we was coming how come
they only sent one

Zoe realizes the answer turns to Wash

ZOE
Get on the Cortex Wave the
Sanchez brothers Li Shen --
anyone whose ever sheltered us
after a heist Tell them to get
out Get out now

SMASH CUT TO
INT BRIDGE - LATER
Silence

Every Cortex screen is on each looking at a different place
Every one shows fire destruction or the snow of an
interrupted signal

Mal stands alone amidst the screens saying nothing After
a long moment all of the screens hitch the images replaced
by identical images of the Operative He looks solemn

THE OPERATIVE
Im sorry But I cannot let you
hide and I cannot let you run
Things become extreme And we
wish for another way

MAL
Dont talk at me like a righteous
man You are a killer of children

THE OPERATIVE
When God wanted Pharaoh to release
His people from bondage -- you
know the story He didnt ask
He sent his plagues down upon
Egypt Thats me Captain The
path to peace is paved with
corpses Its always been so

MAL
So me and mine got to lie down and

die -so-you can tive-in-your- better—

8s

THE OPERATIVE

Im not going to live there How
could you think -- theres no
place for me there any more than
there is for you Malcolm Ima
monster What I do is evil Ive
no illusions about it But it
must be done

MAL
Why Do you know why

THE OPERATIVE
Its not my place to ask

MAL
You will never see River Tam Im
telling you this

THE OPERATIVE
Maybe not But youll keep her
close now and when I blow
Serenity out of the air this will
be ended Youre so terribly out
of your depth Captain Your old
boat cant take the pressure

MAL
She aint buckled yet And the
‘ only reason youre talking such a
lot is you cant get a fix on us

THE OPERATIVE
Yes your scramblers code is too
old for our seekers You love
that yes The small triumph over
modernity You really are the
noble savage

Nobody -- ever -- calls me noble

THE OPERATIVE
But thats whats going to kill
you Malcolm Nobility It
confuses your text which is
self-interest And sin

MAL
oo —o—ioH Ort y matt i know-who stilt -believed———aeessEee
in sin just died by your hand

THE OPERATIVE
What do you believe in

MAL
Not a solitary thing

w THE OPERATIVE

If that were true youd be
nothing more than a Reaver

Something changes in Mals expression
THE OPERATIVE
(continuing)
But then maybe youre not that
far from --
Mal flicks a switch and every screen goes dark

EXT MINING CAMP - MOMENTS LATER

Mal comes striding out where the crew have been gathering
bodies laying blankets over them

MAL
Get these bodies together
ZOE
We got time for gravedigging
MAL
a Zoe you and Simon are gonna rope

‘em together Five or six of ‘em
I want them laid out on the nose
of our ship

SIMON
Are you insane

KAYLEE
What do you mean the bodies

MAL
Kaylee I need you to muck the
reactor core just enough to leave
a trail and make it read like
were flying without containment
not enough to fry us

KAYLEE
These people are our friends --

pe a etn a

Kaylee you got a days work to do
and two hours to do it

wo

MAL (contd)
(turns from her)
Jayne you and Wash hoist up that
J cannon mount Goes right on top
Piece or two of the other ship
stick it on Any place you can
tear hull without inner breach do
that too
(looking around)
And were gonna need paint Were
gonna need red paint

INARA
(getting it)
Oh merciful Buddha protect us

ZOE
Sir Do you really mean to turn
our home into an abomination so we
can make a suicidal attempt at
passing through Reaver space

MAL
I mean to live I mean for us to
live The Alliance wont have
that so we go where they wont
follow

wi JAYNE
Gods balls theres no way were
going out there

And everybody (save River) is talking at once

SIMON
Whats the point of living if you
sink to the level of a savage --

WASH
Theres nothing about this plan
that isnt horrific

INARA
Please we should talk this over --

JAYNE

I aint takin orders from a man
has lost his brainstem --

aod hr thre middie -of it Mal pulls his-gun—ayreS ae
in his face steps back hand on his

oi

MAL
This is how it works Anybody
doesnt wanna fly with me anymore
this is your port of harbour
Theres a lot of fine ways to die
Im not waiting for the Alliance
to choose mine

He walks through the group toward the smashed cockpit of the
Alliance fighter Struggling to get out is the badly wounded
pilot He sees Mal coming and raises his hands in surrender

Mal shoots him in the head turns back

MAL

(continuing)
I mean to confound those killers
and take my shot at getting to
Miranda maybe finding out what
all Im dying for Thats my
theme now So I hear a word out
of any of you that aint helping
me out or taking your leave I will
fucking shoot you

He grabs a body - drops it at Zoes feet as he heads toward
the ship
MAL
(continuing)

Get to work
EXT SPACE - NIGHT

CLOSE ON THE BODIES as they BURN flames passing over them
and suddenly flickering out as dark falls They are patches
of leathered flesh stretched over bone -- monsters screaming
soundlessly in the nothing of space

We arm past them to the windows of the bridge looking in at
Mal watching with Zoe behind and Wash at the helm

And we pull back out to see the whole of Serenity for the
first time It is hardly recognizable Charred corpses on
the nose Cannon atop with a space-suited corpse draped
within long scars welded-on parts and war paint the
trail of green light burns out with sporadic bursts of vapor

It looks for all the world like a Reaver ship

INT CARGO BAY - CONTINUING

Mal comes down the stairs to the catwalk He hesitates then
steps into the shuttle

INT SHUTTLE - CONTINUING

Its dark in here Mal stands with his back to the door no
light on his face shaking Not crying but overcome

INARA
Mal

He looks up shes in the corner looking through that trunk
of hers hands on a long oilcloth wrapped around something

MAL
Didnt see you

INARA
I figured that

MAL
Anything of use in there

INARA
Maybe

She puts it down and crosses to the bed He sits by her

MAL
You dont have to stay in the
shuttle you know Theres empty
rooms if you wanna sleep awhile

INARA
You think anyones set to sleep
Simons portioning out overdoses
of morphine just in case

MAL
Cheerful fellow
(looking around)
Did you really miss this place

INARA
(rueful smile)
Sometimes Not so much right now
A beat He doesnt look at her when he asks

MAL
Why did you leave

— Ftre-deestook—at—himn——— rr nn

INARA
Why didnt you ask me not to

Dissatisfied Mal rises
MAL

I uh Id better go check on the

crew See how the inevitable

mutiny is coming along
They both want to say more They dont He goes
EXT SPACE - NIGHT
Serenity flies silent
INT FOREDECK HALLBRIDGE - NIGHT
The group make their way toward the bridge Those close
enough to get a view out the window are looking freaked --
those already on the bridge are stock still Pressed up
against the glass of the window is River just staring
EXT SPACE - CONTINUING
Reverse to see an armada
The black sky is filled with what must be ninety ships ina
vague cluster as Serenity breaks frame headed toward them
Most of them hang still in the air Some move swimmingly
about Some turn in gentle drifts as though looking around
INT BRIDGE - CONTINUING
They all wait tensed up as they approach the armada
EXT SPACE - CONTINUING

And arrive moving slowly through the ranks of ships

Serenity passes a large bizarrely shaped ship It turns as
though watching her But lets her pass

Another minute and Serenity is through the Armada headed
for the small planet just beyond

The Operative stares blankly at the Ensign

Zoe and Jayne emerge from the airlock in full suits armed
Zoe reads a handheld scanner

Mal pulls off his helmet Breathes looking around him

MAL
Well something sure as hell aint

Face-down on the ground clothes tattered She examines it

skeletons two grown-ups and a small child Clothes in

CLOSE ON KAYLEE walks in front of an office building
staying away from the cars as she hears

JAYNE (0S)
Couple more here

open skin dead blue terribly skinny a thing to haunt

(seeing it)

But she looks --

KAYLEE
GAAAAaaoh God --

-- and steps back horrified as the others approach

Its an office About half the employees are there in
chairs or on the ground all in the same state as the first
fellow We see ANGLES of the corpses as the gang evaluates

JAYNE
How come theyre preserved

MAL
Place mustve gone hermetic when
the power blew Sealed ‘em

KAYLEE
(very upset)
Whatre they doing Whats
everybody doing

SIMON
Theres no discoloration nobodys
doubled over or showing signs of

pain

MAL
Theres gasses that kill painless
right

INARA

But they didnt fall down None
of them They just lay down

SIMON
More than anything it looks like
starvation

MAL
Anybody want to bet theres plenty
of food around

INARA

They just lay down

They notice River now in the middle of the street keening
She drops to her knees clutching her head

As she speaks we see as she sees FLASHES bodies In
homes in piles an entire world gently dead

RIVER
Merciful God please take me
away make them stop theyre
everywhere every city every house
every room theyre all inside me
I can hear them all and theyre
saying nothing GET UP PLEASE
GET THEM UP I will close my
ears and my heart and I will be a
stone please God make me a

Shes starting to damage my calm

JAYNE
Shes right Everybodys dead
This whole world is dead for no
reason

Lets get to the beacon

EXT LANDING STRIP - DAY

Its small -- landing is easier in cities with flying
vehicles At the end of a short runway tipped and damaged
is an Alliance Research Vessel The gang makes its way
towards it

INT RESEARCH VESSEL - DAY

Its a mess doors pried open signs of violence but no
bodies The gang walks through it looking around

River pulls away from Simon suddenly determined She
approaches a console and a small cylindrical object She
turns it slightly --

A hologram squawks to life amidst them all First we see
images that resemble the flashes from Rivers mind Corpses
everywhere We hear and then see DOCTOR CARON standing
exactly where she was when she recorded this message

(As she speaks we see angles of everyone watching taking it
in River silently mouths every word)

CARON
-- just a few of the images weve
recorded and you can see it
isnt it isnt what we thought
Theres been no war here and no
terraforming event The
environment is stable Its the
Pax the G-32 Paxilon Hydroclorate
that we added to the air
processors Its

(tearing up)

well it works it was
supposed to calm the population
weed out aggression Make a
peaceful it worked The people
here stopped fighting And then
they stopped everything else

They stopped going to work
stopped breeding talking
eating

(trying for control)
Theres thirty million people here
and they all just let themselves
die They didnt even kill
themselves They just most
starved When they stopped
working the power grids there
were overloads fires -- people
burned to death sitting in their
chairs Just sitting

There is a loud bang somewhere behind her -- she starts
gathers herself

CARON
(continuing)
I have to be quick There was no
one working the receptors when we
landed so we hit pretty hard We
cant leave We cant take any of
the local transports because

The bang again

CARON
(continuing)
There are people theyre not
people about a tenth of a

percent of the population had the

opposite reaction to the Pax ——--

Their aggressor response
increased beyond madness
Theyve become

CARON (contd)
theyve killed most of us not
just killed theyve done
things

WASH
(quietly)
Reavers they made them

CARON
I wont live to report this and
we havent got power to people
have to know
(loses it here)

We meant it for the best to
make people safer to God
She whirls grabs a gun and fires -- then aims the gun at her

own head - but a Reaver is on her knocks the gun away and
bites her face --

She screams continuously as the Reaver tops her biting at
her and tearing at her clothes at her skin

JAYNE
(quietly)
Turn it off

Wash does nobody saying anything
Mal walks outside
EXT RESEARCH VESSEL - CONTINUING
He takes a few unsteady steps away from the vessel Inara
appears behind him follows -- he holds a hand out behind

him seemingly to make her stop but then he grabs her
shoulder holds her for support She puts her hand over his

MAL
I seen so much death I been on
fields carpeted with bodies
friends and enemies -- I seen men

and women blown to messes no
further from me than you

INARA

But every single one of those
people died on their feet
Fighting

Or hell running away -- doing
summat to get through This is

He looks at her folds her into his arms Brings her face to
his not kissing but touching pressing into each other with
the urgency of pulsing necessary life

INT RESEARCH VESSEL - CONTINUING

River falls to her knees vomiting Simon goes to her puts
his hand on her back lets her ride it out

SIMON

RIVER
Im all right

She looks at him wet eyes full of clarity

RIVER
(continuing)
Im all right

Wash pulls the recording cylinder out of the console
INT SERENITY - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

The cylinder is on the table Mal stands at the head
looking at his crew

MAL

This report is maybe twelve years
old Parliament buried it and it
stayed buried til River dug it up
This is what they feared she knew
And they were right to fear
‘cause theres a universe of folk
that are gonna know it too

(touches the cylinder)
Theyre gonna see it Somebody
has to speak for these people

He pauses Everyone waits a

MAL

(continuing)
You all got on this boat for
different reasons but you all
come to the same place So now
Im asking more of you than I have
before Maybe all Cause as
sure as I know anything I know
this They will try again Maybe
on another world maybe on this
very ground swept clean A year
from now ten theyll swing back
to the belief that they can make
people better And I do not
hold to that So no more running
I aim to misbehave

There is a beat as he eyes them all

JAYNE
My grandma always told me if you
cant do something smart do
something right

By way of emphasis he loudly cocks his big-ass rifle Mal
takes in the fact that Jayne has spoken for them all

MAL
That the same grandma told you
there was an evil dwarf spirit
living in your well

JAYNE
(nodding)
She was a fun grandma

SIMON
Do we have a plan

MAL
Mr Universe We havent the
equipment to broadwave this code
but he can put it on every screen
for thirty worlds Hes pretty
damn close too

RIVER
Based on our orbital trajectories
he reached optimum proximity just
before our sunset If we make a
direct run within the hour were
only 67332 miles out At full
burn wed reach him inside of
three hours

She doesnt notice the reactions to her sudden clarity --
shes still somewhat in her own world

WASH
Still got the Reavers and
probably the Alliance between us
and him

ZOE
Its a fair bet the Alliance knows
about Mr Universe Theyre gonna
see this coming

MAL
No

He takes a long moment his jaw tightening imperceptibly

MAL
(continuing)
Theyre not gonna see this coming

DROP BACK WIDE to see The Operative and ten soldiers are in

MR UNIVERSE
Youll be the first

CLOSE ON the Operatives sword as he unsheathes it
EXT SPACE - NIGHT

We are amongst the Reaver armada Serenity slices quietly
through the ships as we come around and see Miranda receding
in the distance

Serenity drifts through the armada -- and suddenly another
ship fires up running next to her

The two ships pace each other another vessel coming about as
though staring at Serenity who comes closer and closer to
frame till we see the suited corpse draped on the cannon

It suddenly moves its Mal

He swings the cannon round and fires at the ship pacing them
It BLOWS fragmenting into burning bits that spiral into
other ships causing two smaller ones to blow as well

Mal swings around and fires at another ship

EXT SATELLITE - NIGHT

In close orbit waits the Alliance force at least fifty
strong and clearly with high tech firepower We move in on

upside down -- the Alliance ships FIRE missing Serenity but
tagging a few Reaver ships none of whom have slowed down --

Alliance fleet missiles just passing us --

(to himself)
I am a leaf on the wind watch how
I soar

EXT SPACE - CONTINUING

Serenity slips right under the Operatives ship and ducks and
weaves between dozens more The Reaver force hits the
Alliance head on -- and several ships do just that smashing
into bigger ships kamikaze-style everything exploding --

The fleet mobilizes blasting Reaver ships circling around
and an air war begins a frenzied balletic ecstasy of
destruction that the camera hurtles through as ships and
parts of ships fly at and past it

ANGLE SERENITY

She nearly makes it all the way through the alliance fleet
before a barrelling chunk of debris -- which is twice their
size -- forces them to come hard about and remain in the fray

MAL
Chickens come home to roost

They are suddenly JOLTED by a glancing blow from another

ship -- Wash struggles to control her --

(also panicky)
What does that mean

EXT SPACE - CONTINUING

Serenity makes her way past the carnage and heads down toward
the tiny satellite moon

INT THE OPERATIVES SHIP - CORRIDOR - CONTINUING

As the vessel shakes clearly breached The Operative moves
to a door marked DART He puts his thumb to a panel and the
door slides up to reveal a standing almost formfitting one-
man cockpit

EXT THE OPERATIVES SHIP - CONTINUING

The Dart disengages and bullets down towards the surface As
it moves from the Operatives ship we see that a Reaver
vessel has smashed into the main viewshield and the ship is
spinning explosions popping silently all over it

EXT SERENITY - CONTINUING
She continues down the metallic expanse of Mr Universes

little moon complex sprawling below them A moment after
Serenity blows through frame so does a Reaver ship

It fires an electronic pulse at Serenity and sparks fly

EXT LANDING STRIP - CONTINUING

We can see it a long strip which halfway along becomes a
kind of hanger Serenity arcs at it uncomfortably fast

INT BRIDGE - CONTINUING

Wash is fighting the stick with extreme concentration as Zoe
pulls out a seat as well straps in

INT AFT HALL - CONTINUING

Jayne Simon and Inara pull harnesses not unlike Batman the
Ride seats from the ceiling help the others in

EXTINT LANDING STRIPHANGER - CONTINUING

And Serenity HITS the ground -- the landing gear folds and
snaps under the weight -- the ship keeps going now inside
the hanger heading towards the entrance to the facility
slowing fishtailing and coming about a full one eighty -- it
goes beyond the strip and crashes down into the pedestrian
area so that the nose is sticking back out at the runway but
the body of the ship is hidden from it

INT BRIDGE - CONTINUING
There is a moment of quiet

WASH
I ama leaf on the wind Watch --

A massive harpoon CRASHES through the windshield and impales
him to his chair Its as thick around as a telephone pole

Wash has time to open his mouth in surprise before he is dead

——--- CE al

She moves to him --

(continuing)
Wash baby baby no come on you
w gotta move you gotta move baby

please --

Mal rips her away and to the floor as another projectile
slams through the window into the wall above them

EXT LANDING STRIP - CONTINUING

We see the ship that has fired the harpoons as Reavers start
out of it A second Reaver vessel enters frame from above
about to land next to it

EXT SERENITY - MOMENTS LATER

The cargo bay door opens -- just the little door housed
inside the ramp -- and Jayne comes out with his biggest gun
He looks up toward the edge of the runway but no Reavers
have arrived yet

JAYNE
Go

The entire crew piles out all heavily bedecked with weapons

MAL
Head inside

INT BLACK ROOMINNER HALL - MOMENTS LATER

A small double-sized doorway leads to the Black Room which
is the entrance proper to the facility

Mal hits a button and huge thick blast doors open from the
sides AND the top and bottom creating the effect of a square
hole getting bigger The hall itself is smaller than the
black room but still has the arrows on the ceiling that
point to an elevator some fifty feet away

MAL
Come on Jayne rearguard

Zoe slows looking around her

Move the gorram crates Come on

We hear savage SCREAMS from the hanger -- theyre
approaching Mal moves to the door Jayne beside him

ANGLE HIS POV
Reavers rush toward them
He turns to Jayne

MAL

Tell me you brought em this
time

Jayne smiles grimly tosses Mal a grenade as he pops his own
and fastballs it at the Reavers

It explodes in their midst smoke and man-parts flying about
Mal rolls his a shorter distance then slams the door shut

ANGLE THE GRENADE

Explodes raining a bunch of equipment -- and part of a
catwalk -- right in front of the door

In the black room the door nearly buckles from the
explosion Everyone takes positions behind the crates Zoe
stands calmly her back to the door loading her sawed-off

MAL
(continuing moving
back to Zoe)
Zoe are you here

She looks up at him
ZOE
Do the job sir
MAL
You hold Hold till Im back

He takes off -- passes Inara the two of them holding a look
for as long as they can Then hes in the elevator and gone

Jayne moves over to Zoe

JAYNE
Captains right Cant be
thinking on revenge if were gonna
get through this

ZOE
You really think any of us are
gonna get through this

He looks back at their army A companion a doctor a
mechanic and a more-than-usually out of it River A beat
and he looks back at Zoe with forlorn hope

JAYNE
I might

INT MR UNIVERSES HQ - MOMENTS LATER

The elevator stops and Mal makes his way to the island of
screens and machines in the center of the space

The first thing he takes in is that every broadwave port has
been destroyed The second

ANGLE MR UNIVERSE is lying dead eyes open half draped on
his equally still lovebot A trail of blood shows he crawled
from his chair

Mal comes close Nothing He starts to move away again and
the lovebot turns her head her eyes focusing with an audible
whir She speaks with surprisingly realistic expressiveness
and a warped computery version of Mr Universes voice

LOVEBOT
Mal

Mal stops

LOVEBOT
(continuing)
Guy killed me Mal He killed me
with a sword How weird is that

I got a short span here they
destroyed my equipment but I have
a back-up unit bottom of the

complex right over the generator
Hard to get to I know they
missed it They cant stop the
signal Mal They can never stop
the signal

(beat)
Okay this is painful On many
levels Im not --

She turns back powering down Recording over
A beat and Mal takes off
INT BLACK ROOM - CONTINUING

Inara is on her knees unwrapping the oilcloth we saw in her
shuttle River is in the corner clutching her head

RIVER
I cant shut them up
SIMON
Its okay
RIVER
Theyre all made up of rage I
cant

A BANG as a body slams against the door

SIMON
Just stay low Im right here

Jayne moves past them to Zoe takes position by her

JAYNE
She picked a sweet bung of a time
to go helpless on us

ZOE
(calls out)
Jayne and I take the first wave
Nobody shoots less they get past
our fire

Simon moves to Kaylee who is shaky as hell
the door continue

She looks

KAYLEE
Oh I didnt plan on going out
like this I think we did right
but

SIMON
I never planned anything I
just wanted to keep River safe
Spent so much time on Serenity
trying to find us a home I never
realized I already had

at him with soft surprise

SIMON
(continuing)
My one true regret in all this is
never being with you

KAYLEE
With me You mean to say as sex

SIMON
(smiles)
I mean to say

Kaylee snaps her cartridge home with way more
we might expect from her takes steady aim at

Simon looks at her a moment

KAYLEE
Hell with this Im gonna live

The bangs on

then turns his attention to the

Inara come up into frame with the contents of the oilcloth
a bow and arrow which she pulls back with focused grace

ANGLE THE DOOR starts to come off its hinges

INT MR UNIVERSES HQ - CONTINUING

A panel is kicked in from the ceiling and the Operative drops
down having clearly entered from a different location

He looks around carrying a laser-pistol He moves past Mr
Universe and Lenore --

LOVEBOT
Mal
(The Operative turns)
Guy killed me Mal

INT BASEMENT OVER THE GENERATOR - CONTINUING
Mal has reached it and surveys the situation

Before him is a railing and he can look down on the
generator shaft Its miles deep with machines rotating and
grinding and arcs of electricity ricochetting around it

On the other side is a platform with the broadwave console
sitting behind a clear plastic partition Cables and chains
run along the ceiling around a series of ladder rungs

MAL
Hard to get to Thats a fact

INT BLACK ROOM - CONTINUING

The door is pried partially open -- enough for one Reaver to
squeeze through and charge

Zoe stands up and shoots him in the head He arcs back hard
as the second comes Zoe shoots him calmly walking toward
the door --

JAYNE
Zoe Gorramnit

But she is in a trance and we see beneath the calm to the
bubbling magma of rage that keeps her firing single shots
each one a kill till five men down and shes out of ammo

The sixth comes at her swinging a blade and she blocks the
precision of military training still in her as she flips him
wresting the blade free and swinging it down out of frame
bringing it up bloody swinging again as the door bursts open
and shes rushed from behind --

But Jayne totes an automatic sprays killing fire on the lot
moving forward himself --

JAYNE
(continuing)
ZOE Get yer ass back in the line

She looks up almost confused -- and one of Jaynes targets
comes back off the ground and slices at her back with a
blade she screams as he cuts deep -- and an arrow lodges in
his neck

Inara pulls up a fresh arrow shaking only slightly
INT BASEMENT OVER THE GENERATOR - LATER

Mal is on the railing reaching for the rungs on the
ceiling just above him He can almost get them -- one wrong
move and he pitches into the jaws of death

A laser shot nails him in the lower back -- he arches legs
sliding off the rail -- he falls and hits the rail with the
backs of his legs flipping painfully onto his face as he
falls mercifully back onto the platform

The Operative comes around some equipment for a closer shot
as Mal gets shakily up

MAL
(in pain)
Shot me in the back I havent
made you angry have I

THE OPERATIVE
Theres a lot of innocent people
in the air being killed right now

MAL
You have no idea how true that is

Theres no wise-ass attitude in him now They stand facing
off at ten paces

MAL
(continuing)
I know the secret now The truth
that burned up River Tams brain
and set you after her And the Se
rest of the verse is gonna know
it too Cause they need to

THE OPERATIVE
You really believe that

MAL
I do

THE OPERATIVE
You willing to die for that belief

MAL
I am

The Operative raises his gun -- but Mal is the quickdraw
master shoots the gun out of the Operatives hand and gets
two hits to the chest (armored) before he makes it to cover

MAL
(continuing)
Of course that aint exactly plan
A

He drops out his cartridge and slams another in

The Operative hides behind some machinery Tries to peek out
at Mal -- and more shots send him scrambling back to cover

Mal holsters his gun and jumps for the rung above him starts
going hand over hand to the island moving as fast as he can

The Operative sees his moment dives for his gun -- but its
been ruined by Mals shot He looks over at Mal with death
in his eyes He runs at the railing vaults off it and
grabs a chain -- it snaps and he swings grabbing another

He reaches Mal and double kicks him from behind -- Mal flies
off the rung but grabs a chain -- he tries to kick at the
Operative but the guy is frikkin Tarzan he climbs up and
pulls a lever releasing one end of Mals chain -- Mal goes
swinging smacks into the wall six feet below the platform

He scrambles up just as the Operative swings himself toward
the platform from above

INT BLACK ROOMINNER CORRIDOR - CONTINUING

Jayne is still firing continuously as he drags Zoe back to
the barricades Simon moves to help -- Kaylee firing now

squinting with effort -- and pulls open the cut back of Zoes
shirt checks the wound

SIMON
Spines intact --

ZOE
Just gimme a bandage

Simon pulls a spraycan from his bag sprays the wound with a
foam that hardens instantly into an elastic covering

There are a few gun shots (as well as nail-balls and blades)
from the Reavers Jayne switches weapons tossing another to
Zoe and opening fire --

JAYNE
Oh now youre likin guns huh
Cheaters

He takes a hit in the shoulder grimaces and keeps firing

River watches the gun limp in her hand Kaylee grabs it and

starts another round -- but shes peppered with dart-like
projectiles She screams and drops the weapon pulling the
projectiles from her -- Inara helps her up pulls her back as

Zoe shouts

ZOE
Everybody fall back Fall back

Everyone stumbles or is dragged into the inner corridor
Inara hits the controls and the doors start to close from
each side and above and below Then when the hole is maybe
four by four they stop

ZOE
(continuing)
Jayne Grenade

JAYNE
Very last one

He tosses it through the hole Zoe doesnt even flinch from
the blast as she thinks

ZOE

Theyre gonna get in -- -
KAYLEE

Can close it from outside
ZOE

No ones coming back from that
She tries to stand fails
ZOE
(continuing) a
How much ammo do we have
JAYNE
We got three full cartridges and
my swingin cod Thats all

Inara is by the elevator pounding for it to come -——

INARA
Lift isnt moving
ZOE
When they come try to plug the
hole with em

Kaylee cries out and Simon moves to her

KAYLEE
Im starting to lose some feeling
here I think theres something

in them darts they throwed at me

SIMON
Lie still Im gonna give you
something to counteract the --

He stands looking around him His bag is over by Zoe

SIMON
(continuing)
My bag

and SHKOWW the bullet takes him in the belly -- everything
suddenly moving very slowly as he spins slightly one foot
lifted a confused expression on his face -- then speeding
right back up as he slams down on his back gasping for air

Rivers mouth opens in a scream she doesnt make

Blood spreads from Simons belly Inara rushes to him grabs
cloth and puts pressure on the wound puts Simons hand on it

INARA
Keep pressure here
SIMON
My bag Need adrenaline and
a shot of calaphar for Kaylee
I cant River

She is by his side takes his hand She has a kind of
serenity to her like she understands something now

SIMON
(continuing)
River Im sorry

RIVER
No No

The lights go out Everyone looks about them Jayne fires
again but all the sound has bled out save these two

SIMON
I hate to leave

RIVER
You wont You take care of me
Simon Youve always taken care
of me

She stands as the emergency lights come on giving her face
an unearthly glow as she looks down at him

RIVER
(continuing)
My turn

Shes running so fast nobody has time to react til she DIVES
through the hole in the doors then Simon SCREAMS her name
the scream following us back into the Black Room where River
lands in a perfect roll comes up in a room full of Reavers

Without a moments hesitation she makes it to the panel gets
the doors closing She dodges a blade but a blow to’the
back of the head shakes her She weaves around a couple of
Reavers to get to the closing doors but at the last second
her ankle is grabbed and pulled out from under her

The last thing we see is her being dragged back as they swarm
over her

ANGLE THE BLAST DOORS as they shut with a shuddering KLUNG
INT BASEMENT OVER THE GENERATOR - CONTINUING

Mal gets up the chain to the platform The Operative is on
Mal before he gets his footing tackles him as Mals gun goes
skittering over the edge into oblivion There is a railing
here or Mal would go over as well -- but he comes back with

a couple of hammer blows gets the Operative off him

They square off Mal stumbling back into a tool chest
knocking over tools and computer parts

The Operative reaches behind him and pulls his sword
gracefully from the holster under his jacket

Mal produces his weapon a tiny screwdriver

He hurls a toolbox at the Operative and rushes him gets
inside sword range and tries for the neck with the
screwdriver -- the Operative blocks it and works the sword
point against the edge of Mals stomach Starts pushing
slowly despite Mals resistance and breaks skin

Mal looks at the Operative a moment -- and the sword slides
all the way through Mals belly Mals eyes go wide

THE OPERATIVE
You know what your sin is Malcolm

MAL
(shaky smile)
Aw hell Ima fan of all seven

He headbutts the Operative viciously then punches him so
hard he staggers back losing his grip on the sword The
Operative responds with a spin kick -- Mal holds up the
screwdriver and the Operative swings his foot right into it
gasping as Mal pulls the screwdriver -- and leg its stuck
in -- back as he rockets his fist into the Operatives chin

The Operative goes down hard dazed as Mal grabs the sword
still in his belly

MAL
(continuing)
But right now

He pulls the sword out grimacing Holds it over the
Operative The smile gone

MAL
(continuing)
Im gonna have to go with Wrath

He stabs down at his foes face -- but the Operative rolls
out of the way kicks Mal from the ground and is up ina
second grabbing Mals sword hand -- the sword drops -- and

punching him repeatedly in his stomach wound

INT INNER HALL - CONTINUING

The gang is subdued -- because they are all of them injured
and Simon is slipping away Jayne looks at Zoe

JAYNE
You suppose he got through Think
Mal got the word out

ZOE
almost convincingly)
He got through I know he got
through

INT BASEMENT OVER THE GENERATOR - CONTINUING

Mal goes down hard spitting up blood He sees the sword
moves -- but the Operative kicks him in the face Picks him
up Mal too tired to throw a decent punch

THE OPERATIVE
Im sorry

The Operative spins him and DIGS his bunched fingers right
into the same nerve cluster that he paralyzed Doctor Mathias
with Mal goes rigid his face a rictus of pain

The Operative goes near the railing and retrieves his sword
Mal trembles trying to move -- but nothing happens

THE OPERATIVE
(continuing)
You should know theres no shame
in this Youve done remarkable
things But youre fighting a war
youve already lost

He lunges -- and Mal twists gracefully out of the way
grabbing the Operatives swordhand and pulling it forward --
while driving his elbow into the Operatives neck with
staggering force

MAL
Well Im known for that

The Operative drops the blade mouth open stumbling back
unable to make a sound

Mal spins him grabbing both his arms and working his own
through them in a twisted full nelson -- then bringing his
arms up suddenly the Operatives mouth going wider as we
hear his arms crack

Mal drops him sitting against the railing picks up his
sword saying

MAL
(continuing)
Piece a shrapnel tore up that
nerve cluster my first tour Had
it moved

He squats down looks the Operative in the face

MAL
(continuing)
Sorry ‘bout the throat Expect
youd wanna say your famous last
words now Just one trouble

He reaches over the railing pulls the back of the
Operatives jacket through and shoves the sword through the
fabric pinning the Operative in his sitting position

MAL
(continuing)
I aint gonna kill you

He moves to the console starts prepping it

MAL
(continuing)
Hell Im gonna grant your
greatest wish

He inserts the cylinder turns it slightly It hums to life

MAL
(continuing)
Im gonna show you a world without
sin

He hits send all The cylinder lights up and the broadcast
begins Here it is projected as a two-dimensional image on
the clear plastic partition right in front of the Operative

There are images first of the city -- of bodies on the
street in homes and offices image after image just as
we saw on the research vessel -- and in Rivers mind

CARON (V0O)

These are some of the first sites
we scouted on Miranda There is
no one living on this planet
There is no one

Mal hits the controls and a ramp extends towards the other
side He begins to cross Never even looks back

On the Operative trapped watching in growing horror
INT BLACK ROOM - CONTINUING

CLOSE ON A Reaver in EXTREME SLOW MOTION Face full of
fury he is swinging his blade in a frenzy of hate

And a small hand smashes that face so hard that teeth fly --
the Reaver clearing frame to reveal

River

She is bloodied but not killed Shes as she was in the
bar -- moving faster and more efficiently than anyone can
ducking and weaving and gutting and kicking and there are
piles of Reavers already she never breaks concentration as
she uses their own blades against them throws them does
everything in her power to stay one step ahead of -- or
above -- the mob

She slams backwards into a wall opposite the blast doors --
and a grappling hook punches through it just missing her

INT BASEMENT OVER THE GENERATOR - CONTINUING

The Operative watches the end of the broadcast We are on
his face through the clear plastic so the images projected
on it blur right before him the Reaver Dr Caron -- and her
screaming doesnt stop til something is shoved in her mouth

INT INNER HALL - CONTINUING

The gang is still trying to patch themselves together when
the elevator doors open Mal staggers out holding his
bleeding side

ZOE
Sir

MAL
Its done Report

Zoe looks at the badly wounded Simon is about to give a
report -- and the doors start to open behind her

Everyone turns to look those who can feebly raising weapons
as the square iris of the opening blast doors widens to
reveal River standing alone She is holding two Reaver
blades is bloody but unbowed And the only one alive

We hold on her a moment then the wall behind her is ripped
completely away

Behind it grappling hooks chained to a huge tractor pull the
wall away as through the smoke come some fifteen Alliance
soldiers who line up rifles trained on our gang

SOLDIER
Drop your weapons Drop ‘em now

ANOTHER SOLDIER
Do we engage Do we engage

Mal and the others tense up River turns slowly to face the
soldiers blades still gripped A soldier levels his gun at
her sweaty and frantic others still shouting

INT BASEMENT OVER THE GENERATOR - CONTINUING
The Operative sits in silence the voices coming over his com

a kill order Do we have an order

INT BLACK ROOM - CONTINUING

CLOSE ON THE SOLDIERS FINGER SQUEEZING THE TRIGGER
BLACK OUT

EXT DESERT PLANET - SUNSET

We are close on a gravestone It is rounded looks more like
a bell than a headstone It is topped by a jar built ‘into
the stone The jar is weathered tin at top and bottom but
glass in the middle Inside the glass we can see one of
those slightly moving photos It is of Mr Universe and his
lovebot and the name Mr Universe is carved roughly in the
stone beneath

The camera moves to the right and we see another such stone
this one bearing the image and inscription Shepherd Derrial
Book

The third is Hoban Washburne Wash

The camera continues moving right but the next stone houses
a small home-made rocket with pieces of paper taped to it
instead of a picture-jar And fixing another slip of paper
to it is River

She moves away from the stone as Mal does likewise Theyre
flanked by the crew Jayne Inara (to whom Mal moves)
Simon who stands holding River before him and hand in hand
with Kaylee He has a crutch supporting his other side

There is a moment then they all move aside saying nothing
Between them walks Zoe in a simple white funeral gown
holding a burning taper

She stands at the stones a moment then holds the taper to
the rocket fuse Stands back with the others

The rocket shoots up into the darkening sky They all watch
its sputtering tail a moment then it it explodes in a series
of fireworks

WIDE ON the group as the fireworks go off over their heads
We are close on another explosion when it becomes

CLOSE ON A BLOWTORCH spitting sparks Widen to see

EXT REPAIR YARDSERENITY - DAY

Zoe is harnessed to the nose of the ship welding on a
replacement for the very window the harpoon that impaled Wash
came through

INT DUCT INSIDE SERENITY - DAY

We are close on River as she works inside a crawlspace just
above the engine room replacing wires Some of them run to
a computer screen that she checks and adjusts

EXT REPAIR YARDTOP OF SERENITY - DAY

Mal and Jayne hold onto the cannon as a crane is lifting it
off the top of the ship

Close on Mal as he watches it go
WIDER ANGLE
EXT REPAIR YARD - CONTINUING

And here we see the whole ship for the first time harnessed
by the wings above the ground so she can be worked on all
over The cannon is being hoisted away from her as a crew of
repairmen wheel new landing gear under her belly

INT ENGINE ROOM - DAY

Kaylee deeply greasy tweaks a part on the engine and
crosses to the back where Simon shirtless and not entirely
ungreasy himself is wrenching a bolt into place above his
head A moment looking at him and she cant help herself --
she slides her arms around his chest

EXT SERENITY - DAY

On a scaffold Inara repaints the name on the nose with
elegant precision

INT ENGINE ROOM - DAY
Kaylee and Simon are just making out like fiends work

completely forgotten With nothing resembling elegant
precision they sink out of frame to the floor

A beat and Rivers head appears from the crawlspace above
looking down at them with detached curiosity
EXT REPAIR YARDSERENITY - DAY
Its raining as Mal is hauling in the last of the repair
equipment The camera moves around him skirting the ground
of the junkyard till it lands on a figure in foreground

standing watching him from some twenty feet away

Mal stops doesnt turn Hand near his gun

MAL
If youre here to tell me we aint
finished then we will be real

quick

The Operative stands just under the canopy of the nose of the
ship framed by the rain behind

THE OPERATIVE
Do you know what an uproar youve

caused Protests riots -- cries
for a recall of the entire
Parliament
MAL
(turning)

Weve seen the broadwaves

THE OPERATIVE
You must be pleased

MAL
Verse wakes up a spell Wont be
long ‘fore she rolls right over
and falls back asleep Taint my
worry

THE OPERATIVE
I cant guarantee they wont come
after you The Parliament They
have a hundred men like me and
they are not forgiving

MAL
That dont bode especially well
for you giving the order to let

us go patching up our hurt

THE OPERATIVE
I told them the Tams were no
longer a threat -- damage done

THE OPERATIVE (contd)
They might listen but I think
they know Im no longer their man

MAL
They take you down I dont expect
to grieve overmuch Like to kill
you myself I see you again

THE OPERATIVE

You wont There is
(small grim smile)

-nothing left to see

Mal looks at him a moment then picks up his gear to head
inside The Operative starts away into the rain then stops
to look up at the nose of the ship

ANGLE the newly painted Serenity standing tall in the rain

THE OPERATIVE
(continuing)
Serenity You lost everything
in that battle Everything you
had everything you were how
did you go on

Mal hits the button to close the inner doors steps inside as
they slide together Glances at the Operative unimpressed

MAL
You still standing there when the

engine starts you never will
figure it out

The Operative watches the door shut A moment and he goes

INT FOREDECK HALL - CONTINUING

Mal comes in and runs into Inara Jayne passes through as
they talk heading down into his bunk Pays them no mind
Neither do Simon and Kaylee in the dining room stowing
supplies

MAL
Were taking her out Should be
about a days ride to get you back
to your girls

INARA

MAL
(moving past her)
You ready to get off this heap and
back to a civilized life

He looks at her a smile in his eyes

MAL
Good answer

He turns and heads into the bridge
INT BRIDGE - CONTINUING

Mal eases himself into his seat Takes a moment to adjust
one of Washs dashboard dinosaurs then looks to his left

MAL
You gonna ride shotgun help me

You know what the first rule of
flying is Well I suppose you
do since you already know what
Im about to say

RIVER
I do But I like to hear you say
it

He looks out at the rain on his windows at his screens
taking her up as he says

MAL
Love You can learn all the math
in the verse but you take a boat
in the air you dont love shell
shake you off just as sure as the
turning of worlds Love keeps her
in the air when she oughta fall
down tells you shes hurting
‘fore she keens Makes her a home

River also looks out at the sky

RIVER
Storms getting worse

MAL
Well pass through it soon enough

EXT SERENITY - CONTINUING

As we shoot up with her through sheeting rain towards the
top of the sky

EXT SPACE - MOMENTS LATER
We are looking down on the stormclouds as Serenity bursts out
of them comes at us flared by the sun behind the planet as

she passes us her Firefly effect lighting up about to shoot
off into the heavens --

There is a spark and a piece of paneling pops off whips at
camera blacking out the frame

What was that
