INT SCHOOL CLASSROOM - GREEN TOWN - DAY
—— ee REN TOWN DAY

A big almost empty schoolroom in a small American town
in a timeless age between the late 1920s and the early
1930s The SILENCE is underlined by the breathy TICK
of a schoolroom clock and the SCRATCHING of two pens

We SEE TWO YOUNG BOYS sitting at their desks writing
Their names are WILL HALLOWAY and JIM NIGHTSHADE Will
is as fair as Jim is dark The only other person in
the room is MISS FOLEY the schoolmistress She is
about forty very plain indeed with a dress buttoning
up to her neck and an expression of sadness On the
blackboard behind her in copperplate handwriting is
the line that the boys have to write out as a punish-
ment We must not whisper to each other in class

ANOTHER ANGLE

We SEE Will his paper covered with the lines writing
out the last of them

Then we SEE Jim He is drawing on an odd sheet of paper

a cruel caricature of Miss Foley her beaky nose her
jutting chin As Jim finishes drawing he HEARS a step
behind him and Opening the lid of his desk a crack slides
the drawing in

ANOTHER ANGLE

Miss Poley has left her desk and is standing behind the
boys

glow brighter - an almost dazzling light is shining
from it

Standing in it we SEE a beautiful YOUNG GIRL dressed
exactly as Miss Foley is in Miss Foleys dressing gown
and nightdress holding the free ride ticket in her hand -
it is Miss Foley young and beautiful as she has always
wanted to be her dearest wish has been fulfilled

As we watch the mirror it becomes even brighter more
dazzling unbearably bright - and then there is a moments
complete darkness In it the MUSIC stops and then

We SEE Miss Foley in the hall She has become the beautiful
young girl exactly like her reflection in the mirror She
drops the ticket which flutters to the floor She puts her
hands across her eyes Then she puts out her hands holds
them out cant see them She feels for the mirror and

Unseen by them the Dwarf waddles out of the shadows towards
the pile of cloth and bone that is all that remains of Mr
Dark Strange BUBBLING SOUNDS emerge from its parchment
mouth as the Dwarf gathers it in his arms and scuttles off
CROONING over his obscene burden as though it were a child
In BG the last tattered remnants of the carnival vanish
towards the horizon The rain diminishes the wind drops

ANOTHER ANGLE - HALLOWAY and THE BOYS

as they let out a great SHOUT OF LAUGHTER and fall together
in one great swooping move embraced one person in wondrous
release and love

ANOTHER ANGLE “ae

The rain stops The dark clouds seem to roll back back
away from them Jim looks around then at the others
Halloway smiles at him hugs him close

HALLOWAY
Welcome back son

Jim looks from him to Will his mouth trembles

WILL
(smiles at him)
He did it My our Dad did it

HALLOWAY
We all did it Together With
love Remember that boys
Thats what defeats them every
time Love and laughter

A moment Then

WILL
Gosh look

ANOTHER ANGLE kan
The sky has cleared The sun is rising over the distant town
WILL
(continuing)
Its dawn
JIM
(suddenly as though
inspired)
Last one into Main Street is an
old lady
He starts off at a run

WILL
Oh no you dont

He hares after him Halloway hesitates briefly grins
calls

HALLOWAY
No sir

He runs after the boys gaining on them

EXT HILLTOP ABOVE MEADOW - DAWN 201
The figures of Halloway and the boys break over the rise run-
ning in tandem their faces bright with laughter

ee
As they run OUT OF FRAME CAMERA HOLDS on the hill crest and
we SEE beyond in the distance a puff of smoke and HEAR
the CHUFF-CHUFF of a train engine receding The carnival is
leaving town - heading for a distant horizon where dark clouds
still hover far away

EXT MAIN STREET - DAWN 202
Barber pole in FG motionless only a very faint dim baled
light - as Jim Will and Halloway race toward it increasing
speed Arrived their hands reach out simultaneously to
touch slap hold it as -

HALLOWAY and BOYS
(in unison)
Tie

MAIN MUSIC THEME starts as at their touch the pole suddenly
lights up andbegins once again to spiral its red and white
stripes upwards For a moment they stand there grinning at
each other their faces bathed in the rosy glow

Will suddenly thinks of something He fishes the harmonica
out of his pocket hands it to his father Halloway looks
at it then at Will grins puts it to his mouth and picks

up the THEME MUSIC as he and the boys CAMERA PANNING to
HOLD THEM walk away in warm companionship down the leaf-
strewn early morning street

END TITLES - begin to rise - and UNDER THEM we SEE
A SERIES OF DISSOLVES - MORNING 203

A SERLES 2

MISS FOLEY - in her nightclothes opening her front door to
pick a milk bottle off her step She is her old self

TOM FURY - with his bag standing at the end of Main lalialial
Street thumbing a lift out of town

MR TETLEY - hauling his Wooden Indian from inside his store
MR CROSETTI - in his barber shop donning his overalls ballad
ED THE BARMAN - sweeping the sidewalk outside his bar
CAMERA PANS to the poster on the wall tattered now for
DARKS PANDEMONIUM CARNIVAL And across it a sticker
which reads RETURNING SOON BY POPULAR DEMAND
