26-and-a-half years We were partners He

Id like to speak with him

MAYA

Is there something I can help you with

ROMAN
First notwithstanding I doubt I’1l be
able to do this much longer progressiver
lawyering I’m not accustomed without
William You see the criminal side of our
practice funded our legal and policy
challenges as in defendant’s rights
prison conditions drafted attacks on
state and federal criminal code If I
were freed of criminal work I could
return to my roots the bigger battles
organized mass action supported by
sweeping legal challenges With my skills
and experience I’m quite confident I
could bring this organization right back
in line with its core beliefs

MAYA
I wasn’t aware wed strayed

ROMAN
I’m not talking about nickel-and-dime
reformism I’m speaking of igniting
sustained mass movements supported by
rule change and injunctive relief and
aggregate results using class action
tactics I’m taking about a return to
using activist litigation creatively
defensively and counter-offensively

MAYA
I’m proud of what we’ve done I think
were making significant headway in many
areas

ROMAN
That’s just an excuse to feel better and
slack off

JEFF
Who’s slacking off

MAYA shoots JEFF a look ROMAN hands MAYA his RESUME

ROMAN
I attended Western State College of Law
at Argosy University in Fullerton I
started the first student union there
Getting my degree I chose cause over
ambition I could’ve joined a big firm
seduced like the rest of them but I was
inspired by Mister Jackson and went to
work for him Our civil rights victories
are all detailed right there As for my
personal life at a certain point I had
to decide whether to have a family or a
career I couldn’t have both so I stayed
on the front lines and I’m offering now
at this time in my life to work
exclusively as your long-haul three-
dimensional revolutionary in-house
full-time paid legal advocate

MAYA
Mister Israel we’re all volunteers here
Our few salaried staff work at the
national headquarters in Washington

ROMAN
Id go to interview but am precluded for
pecuniary reasons Money of late has
become a motivating factor in my life

MAYA

Be that as it may the position’s filled
As for nickel and dime reformism there’s
been a shift in tactics away from the
idea of some ultimate mass victory Our
focus now is challenging the everyday
impacts of racialization and oppression
and applying them to individual action

ROMAN
I’m worth having in this thing

MAYA
I have no doubt of that

ROMAN
Because there is something to be fired up
about

MAYA
We are believe me

ROMAN
Ill keep going through William’s rolodex
then thank you for taking the time

MAYA
If you’d like to volunteer we have a
meeting next week We could use someone
with your legal expertise to give a talk

ROMAN
Id like that Here’s my card I crossed
off my old office address and wrote in my
home that’s if you contact me via mail

MAYA
I’1l probably just text you
ROMAN
I know how to do that Good day

CONNOR

NOVAK
Did you hear about Tempura House
CONNOR
No what’s that
NOVAK

ROMAN
That’s funny
NOVAK and CONNOR look over leaving with their drinks

ROMAN
Hit the lights and they run like roaches

NOVAK

NOVAK
Did you compare us to roaches

ROMAN
There’s no tip-toeing sideways into this

CONNOR
We’re just blowing off steam

ROMAN
You’re tourists

ROMAN takes another cookie eats as he leaves and CUT TO
OFFICE BUILDING

Lit against the night end of the work day as ROMAN
exits walks across the plaza headphones on
doesn’t hear GEORGE calling his name catching up to him
near a fountain

GEORGE
Roman Jesus I heard about you today in
the kitchen Novak’s our number two And
that’s not all Schooling Sanchez in a
crowded elevator

ROMAN
The man doesn’t understand character
evidence

GEORGE
I sent you an email to come to my office

ROMAN
People think they send an email it goes
straight to your brain

GEORGE
This is a huge problem You better take
what I’m saying seriously because I’m
being very very fucking sincere with you

ROMAN
You knew what you were getting when you
brought me in

GEORGE
I thought you were functional

ROMAN
I think you hired me George to hold
your feet to the fire Because you’re
tired of treating low-income clients like
dollar signs and because just maybe you
remember what it feels like to care

GEORGE
I hired you to make a buck which is why
I thought you took it

ROMAN
I need money of course badly but what
I need more is an ally

(MORE )

ROMAN (CONTD)
I’m offering to partner with you on a
piece of ground-breaking litigation I’ve
worked on for over twelve years now

ROMAN holds up his old bulging legal case

ROMAN
Inside is arguably the most important
brief in American legal history and I
say that with due competence This is a
job for a legend or someone who wants to
become one Let me tell you about it

GEORGE
No Jesus Just stop Do you want this
job or not Yes or no

ROMAN
Yes

GEORGE

Then stop harassing people From now on

you stick to clients and memoranda only

Nothing else under no condition That’s

it Anything else you run by me And

don’t come in tomorrow without a suit

ROMAN is seated as DERRELL ELLERBEE enters manacles
GUARDS shackle his feet to bolts in the floor leave

ROMAN
I’m Roman Israel one of your lawyers
How are they treating you
DERRELL silent chained foot tapping fast

ROMAN
Do you need anything

DERRELL
I need to get out of here

ROMAN
Do you understand the charges

DERRELL
Yeah they want to bury me

ROMAN
From here out everything we discuss is
confidential

DERRELL
I gotta be careful

ROMAN
Have you been threatened

DERRELL
I didn’t shoot that guy I just went in
I didn’t know what he was gonna do

ROMAN
You gave a statement to the police

DERRELL
I asked for a lawyer

ROMAN
Prior to that after they read you your
right you continued to speak to the
detectives I’1l demand the tape and
transcript but they claim you said you
knew Carter Johnson had a gun

DERRELL
Not that he was gonna use it

ROMAN
Entering the store knowing he had a gun
will be argued as planning and abetting
That’s the criteria for First Degree
murder

DERRELL
CJ shot the clerk I saw it I’1l testify
if they’1l let me out

ROMAN
They won’t release you the charges are
too severe and the case is too strong We
could approach the DA see what they’d
offer for your testimony

DERRELL
Probation

ROMAN
The best you could hope for is possible
reduction to murder in the second degree

DERRELL
I know where CJ’s holed up

(leans in whispering)

Plus testifying What’s that worth

ROMAN
Possibly a lot The two combined could
carry significant weight You understand
the risks What you’re looking at

DERRELL
I gotta be transferred to protective
custody first

ROMAN
This is what you want to do

DERRELL
I don’t want to but I will

VIEW FROM THE STREET

SOMEONE watching from a CAR starting to trail and CUT TO

ROMAN

Threading the crowded sidewalk GEORGE right beside
ROMAN

All those years practicing to achieve
what Technical triumphs scouring law
books for loopholes and confabulation
Then today in the middle of nowhere I
had a revelation an insight so sweeping
so clear building directly off my other
brief It was me George It was always
there I never saw it before because I
never experienced the other side You see
I’m plaintiff and defendant
simultaneously I file against myself I
represent myself thereby expanding the
full scope of the legal desert The
judgement’s built in The only thing left
is forgiveness and I grant that to
myself Because the act doesn’t make a
person guilty unless the mind is guilty
as well Of course I expect challenges as
there’s no precedents or derivative
interpretation but the argument is sound
the premise true and I have no doubt it
will be upheld by the highest courts in
the land

GEORGE
You’re insane

ROMAN
I’ve never been more clear

GEORGE
That’s what we’1ll argue

ROMAN
Be careful what you say You don’t
represent me in this so the rules of
confidentiality won’t apply My entire
defense will be based on an unequivocal
recitation of truth

GEORGE stopping stunned ROMAN continuing on
calling back

ROMAN

You get it George You have such a

tremendous future It’s so bright I swear

it’s blinding
