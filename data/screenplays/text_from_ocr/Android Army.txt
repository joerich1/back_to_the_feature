ANDROID ARMY

INT CARNUBIUM MINE -- DAY
A pick axe SLAMS into solid rock breaking off a chunk
The prisoner lowers his axe and wipes sweat from his brow

Muscled arms a trim body alien face partially covered by

the nose piece from a rebreather tank MERRITT is a hip

alien with a sarcastic wit and a kick back attitude sentenced
to 25 years for hijacking cargo ships

A GUARD nudges Merritt with a rifle prompting him to work

MERRITT
Hey Cant you see Im trying to sleep

Merritt hefts the axe ad gets back to work
THERE ARE THREE TYPES OF PRISONERS working the mine
Aliens like

Humans like PRATT a burned out three time looser with a
weight lifters

But more than half the prisoners are chrome fingernailed
Androids sentenced for killing humans on Earth None of
the Androids wear re-breathers they dont need them

RALPH 124C41 is the leader of the Android gang A HUGE mean
looking droid with metal fingernails and grey eyes guilty
of brutally murdering more than fifty humans He slams his
axe into the rock Imagining its the Wardens head

Working beside Ralph 124C41 are his two henchmen SMITH EE17
a wiry Android with slicked back hair aluminum teeth and
pincher claw hands

And COBLENTZ HL2000 whose body is criss-crossed with baseball-
like seams where hes been sewn together after knife fights

Coblentz HL2000 breaks through a wall exposing a vein of
glimmering Carnubium

COBLENTZ
The fucking motherlode Vein of

Carnubium

Merritt wrinkles his nose under the rebreather

MERRITT
Shit Coblentz what you found is a
damned Deros Cave If you werent a
fucking Android you could smell em
Lets get out of here before were
lunch

SUDDENLY a slimy DEROS worm breaks through the opening in
front of Coblentz and EATS the PRISONER next to him

The other PRISONERS yell and scramble out of the mine

One of the GUARDS fires his rifle forcing the Deros back

EXT MOUTH OF THE CAVE -- DAY

The PRISONERS sit along the side of the mountain taking a
break Merritt looks up when NOWLAN nudges him with his rifle

NOWLAN
Warden wants to see you

MERRITT
Must be my lucky day

JACK NOWLAN is head guard of the prison mining colony Tough
but good natured hes Esau to Merritts James Dean-like
Jacob here on the twin sunned planet Isaac

Nowlan clips magnetic leg shackles onto Merritt then nods
for his assistant AL BESTER to take over

Bester is a farm boy prison guard Not only second in
command but Nowlans best friend He wears a cowboy hat
has a small town attitude Bester gestures for Merritt to
get to his feet

Nowlan prods Ralph 124C41 with the rifle and the Android
grabs the barrel Nowlan pulls the gun back then JAMBS it
into Ralphs gut

NOWLAN
Warden wants to see you

RALPH
Screw you screw

NOWLAN
Ive got the gun Screw YOU Now you
going to cooperate or am I going to
have to shoot you again

Ralph snarls and Nowlan clips on the magnetic shackles

Nowlan prods Ralph to his feet escorts the prisoners away

EXT PRISON BUILDING - ESTABLISHING -- DAY

The Prison Building scorches under Isaacs twin suns

INT GERNSBECKS OFFICE -- DAY

Nowlan and Bester prod the two prisoners into chairs across
from Warden Gernsbeck

In his tailored suit and gold Rolex VERNON GERNSBECK is the
type of slimy bigoted corrupt warden they make prison movies
about Trophies and political photos adorn the office
obscuring the UN flag in the corner

On his desk near his polished brass name plate is a photo
of his pretty twenty year old daughter GARBY

GERNSBECK
(sarcastic)
My two favorite prisoners Merritt
Ralph 124C41

MERRITT
What do you want Verne Ima busy
man

GERNSBECK

Nowlan Bester Better stick around
Nowlan and Bester nod and keep their guns ready
Gernsbeck lifts two manila folders giving a false smile

GERNSBECK
Ive been looking over your files
gentlemen Interesting reading
(to Merritt)
Mr Merritt Twenty five years hard
labor for the armed hijack of twelve
cargo shuttles
MERRITT
Fourteen There was two they couldnt
prove

GERNSBECK
You seem to have trouble obeying the
rules around here

(MORE)

GERNSBECK (CONTD)
Youve been disciplined by electroshock
forty three times
(beat)
I have disciplined you more than thirty
times myself

MERRITT
(sotto)
Sadistic fucker

GERNSBECK
What was that

Merritt just smiles
Gernsbeck pulls the other folder and looks up at Ralph 124C41

GERNSBECK
Ralph 124C41 Life without parole for
murdering fifty seven people on Earth
It says here you were reprogrammed
twice but kept on killing

RALPH
Humans are scrap

GERNSBECK
If it were my decision I would have
you disassembled and melted down
sold as slag

MERRITT
Ralph the toaster

Gernsbeck looks from Ralph to Merritt
GERNSBECK

As you know your labor has been leased
by Manrocci Industries to mine the
Carnubium deposits here on the planet
Isaac Now that the Carnubium has
been depleted this prison colony
will be closed down

(beat)
The human and alien prisoners will be
reassigned to the mining colony on

Mars
RALPH
And the droids

GERNSBECK
The Androids will be set free But

remain here on Isaac

RALPH
What about a repairs technician

Gernsbeck gives Ralph an evil smile

GERNSBECK
No If you break down youre on
your own Maybe you can repair
yourself

Ralph goes berserk

RALPH
You piece of scrap Im gonna kill
you You and all the other human
scraps Ill kill you ALL

Nowlan and Bester hold him in his chair

Gernsbeck hits a buzzer Two other guards enter the office
KLINE a jokester ex-Marine and STILSON an attractive female
guard Stilson and Nowlan exchange smoldering looks sparks

of attraction between them

KLINE SLAMS Ralph with his gun butt until he sparks then
drags him out with Bester and Stilsons help

Merritt scoops the photo of Garby off the Wardens desk and
studies the picture

MERRITT
Come on Verne This is just an excuse
to keep me away from your daughter
You know she wants me

Gernsbeck pulls the photo out of Merritts hands

GERNSBECK
Keep your hands off my daughter

MERRITT
Okay But you better tell her to keep
her hands off of me You KNOW shes

looking for some close encounters

GERNSBECK
Ill light you up like a Christmas
Tree Youll get enough voltage to
fry that evil little sociopathic brain
of yours

MERRITT
She must take after her mother Verne
because I dont see a lick of family
resemblance Was your mail man a
handsome guy

Gernsbeck is about to explode He turns to Nowlan

GERNSBECK
Get him out of here

MERRITT
I was just beginning to like it here
Thinking about opening an ice rink

Nowlan uses his gun to prod Merritt to his feet

NOWLAN
Come on Now

Merritt lifts his hands and co-operates allowing Nowlan to
escort him out of the Wardens office
INT COMMAND CENTER -- DAY

Nowlan escorts Merritt out of the Wardens office and across
the Command Center

THE COMMAND CENTER is a circular room with work stations a
security section where video monitors show various interior
and exterior views of the prison and a vidmap of the prison
with lighted points showing where prisoners are

A guard named CARTER is on security duty watching the video
monitors in the security section He nods as Nowlan passes
by but ignores Merritt

HALFWAY across the command center they pass GARBY Warden
Gernsbecks pretty twenty year old daughter

Garby is one of the few people on the planet not dressed in
prison denim or guard uniforms Shes dressed in a VERY

sexy outfit

MERRITT
Well hello

Nowlan tries to pull Merritt away from Garby but she changes
course so that she can run her hand across Merritts body

sensually

GARBY
Is it true what they say about Smovs

MERRITT
Depends upon what they say

Garby whispers something in Merritts ear and he laughs

MERRITT
Well thats true about ME

GARBY
Is it

They exchange flirtatious smiles and Nowlan YANKS Merritt
away from her dragging him to the doorway marked AIRLOCKS

Merritt looks at her over his shoulder

MERRITT
Until we meet again

GARBY
Ill be waiting

They exit and Garby crosses to her fathers office and pops
open the door

ON THE VIDMAP
We see two red dots exit the building and cross the terrain
to a section labeled Carnubium Mines

INT CARNUBIUM MINE -- DAY

Ralph 124C41 slams the pick axe into the rock grumbling to
himself Hes about to explode in anger

Pratt cracks through some rocks and a cloud of dust billows
into his face He takes a step back covering his eyes
bumping into Ralph

Ralph spins using the head of his axe to press Pratt back
against the wall of the cave

RALPH
Human scrap Dont ever touch me

Merritt sets down his axe moves between Ralph and Pratt

MERRITT
It was an accident tin man No reason
to blow a fuse

RALPH

I do what I please

MERRITT

Back off or Ill piss on you while

you sleep and rust your ass

Ralph lowers the axe head from Pratts neck and JABS it

at Merritt

RALPH
Screw you

Merritt grabs the axe head quickly

MERRITT
We can do without the axe cant we
Settle this like men Oh I forgot
Youre not anatomically correct are
you

Ralph lets go of the axe and rushes Merritt
WHAM

The two begin fighting and it spills out of the cave into
the twin sunlights

EXT MOUTH OF THE CAVE -- DAY

Ralph and Merritt fight A circle of prisoners around them
ON ONE SIDE OF THE CIRCLE Human and Alien prisoners cheer
on Merritt On the opposite side Android prisoners with
chrome fingernails cheer on Ralph 124C41

WHAM

Ralph 124C41 lands a pair of solid punches to Merritts chest
pressing him back

RALPH
Ready to die Alien

MERRITT
No Im ready to pound you into sheet

metal

Merritt blocks Ralphs next punch lands a SOLID hit to the
Androids jaw The Human and Alien prisoners CHEER

Coblentz HL2000 yells at the cheering crowd

COBLENTZ
No one can fight an Android and win

PRATT
Yeah Merritt will turn him into SCRAP

Both sides CHEER and JEER at each other Tension and hatred
runs thick between steel and flesh

Merritt tries a combination to Ralphs face hitting with
his right But Ralph plucks his left hand out of the air
before it can make contact and SQUEEZES it

Merritt screams and we can hear the snap crackle and pop of
bones breaking Merritt kicks Ralph in the chest forcing
the Android to let go of his hand

Merritt staggers back cradling his injured hand

THE LINE OF ANDROIDS pushes Merritt back towards Ralph
punches

titans

WHAM

Merritt stumbles right into Ralphs arms The Android grabs
Merritts neck and squeezes cutting off his air Merritt
tries pulling the Androids hands off him but cant

RALPH
No air no life

Merritt is beginning to turn blue when he pulls back his
head and SLAMS it into Ralphs

Ralph lets go of Merritt staggering back from the force of
the head butt

Merritt takes a deep breath from the rebreather tank and
goes into action He spins kicking Ralph in the head

RALPH AND MERRITT exchange kicks and
Its a battle of the

Merritt is a great fighter but his blows do little to slow

down Ralph 124C41 No one can fight an android and win
COBLENTZ
Steel against flesh You CANT win
Merritt
PRATT

Hell win Brains against silicon

WHAM

Merritt takes two brutal kicks to the head reeling backwards
The line of Androids pushes him back into the ring

Ralph sends a foot flying at Merritts head but Merritt
catches it and flips him head over heels onto the sandstone

MERRITT
Kissing the ground I walk on tin
man

RALPH

Screw you

Ralph rushes Merritt slicing out with his chrome fingernails
and tearing into the Aliens shirt Merritt jumps back
then lands a pair of kicks to Ralphs head
Merritt moves in to punch the Android but Ralph swings out
and kicks the rebreather off Merritts face Without oxygen
Merritt falls back clutching at his throat

RALPH LAUGHS in victory

Merritt grabs the rebreather mask and forces it onto his
face taking deep breaths until he stabilizes

BANG BANG Two gunshots

Nowlan and Bester break through the circle and pulls Merritt
and Ralph off of each other

NOWLAN
Break it up Break it up

BESTER
Who wants the first one Coblentz

Bester aims his rifle from Android to Android
They all fall back arms in front of them

Nowlan grabs Merritt by the collar and drags him out of the
circle tossing him against the rocks

NOWLAN
You stupid convict Trying to get
yourself killed That androidll
tear you apart

MERRITT
Hes scrap

NOWLAN
Some day Alien you and me is gonna
fight

MERRITT

Ill be looking forward to it

Nowlan slams Merritt back against the rocks trying to knock
the grin off his alien face

No luck Merritt moves to his feet and laughs

INT LOCKER ROOM -- DAY

NOWLAN SLAMS THE DOOR on his locker anger still bubbling
inside of him

BESTER

cage like that

INT CIRCULAR HALLWAY -- DAY

Nowlan and Bester walk around a circular hallway towards the
crew quarters

BESTER

rules youd have asked her to be
your naked rhumba partner long ago

NOWLAN

computers for shuttle take off and
atmosphere manufacturing

STILSON

Giesy looks up from hammering frowns threateningly at Kline

KLINE

Giesy growls realizing that Kline is making fun of him
Before he can quote scripture JW CAMPBELL saunters in

Campbell is the pilot of the shuttle a good looking flyboy
in the overly fancy uniform of the US Space Force

CAMPBELL

Merritt and Gernsbeck fight exchanging punches
The others watch them fight it out
Merritt is in better condition and grabs Gernsbecks fist
before it can make contact tossing the Warden over his
shoulder and onto the floor

Merritt moves over Gernsbeck who covers his face from the
impending stomp Which never happens

MERRITT

Afraid Im gonna stomp you

(beat)
Thats the difference between you and
me Verne You hurt people because

Merritt turns and walks away

Gernsbeck gets to his feet and attacks Merritt from behind
Blind-siding him Nowlan pulls him off trying to contain
the Wardens attacks

NOWLAN
Warden Let it go Just calm down

GERNSBECK
You saw what he did to me We should

face Yelling at him shoving him

GERNSBECK

But nothing happens

When he gets to the end of the hall and the Airlock doors
he gestures for Garby and Campbell to join him

tries to stagger to his feet

BULLETS fly around Garby and Merritt as they race towards

He provides cover fire blasting away at some of the Androids
Sending some slamming backwards in a shower of sparks

Campbell crawls along the floor leaving a trail of blood

But Merritt realizes they dont have a chance

He turns to her between blasts and yells

MERRITT

After blasting one last Android into scrap

As soon as Garby is gone Merritt tries to save Campbell

Damned hunk of tin

Smith EE17 twist the gun around to aim at Campbell

SMITH EE17
Human scrap

Campbell sees the gun aiming right at his face and presses
the barrel up only moments before it discharges

A hole is blasted into the ceiling

Smith EE17 yanks the gun away from Campbell then clubs him
over the head with it Knocking him out
Then Smith EE17 turns to the other Androids

up at Garby

NOWLAN
Its the only time I ever kissed her

Merritt nods to the door and the Androids beyond

PRATT

Pratt swings the gun towards Nowlan

PRATT
Why dont we just get on the shuttle
and get out of here

NOWLAN
We wouldnt get far before we ran out
of fuel
(beat)
Then wed be adrift in the galaxy
without any life support systems

PRATT
At least nobodyd be shooting at us

MERRITT
Sure why give up a quick death when
we could die slowly of asphyxiation

Pratt reaims his gun at
Merritt
Behind him Garby slowly creeps forward

PRATT
I dont need any shit from you
Merritt

MERRITT

What do you want Pratt The good
news There isnt any Were stuck
on this piece of shit planet for the
next three hours while that ship fuels
(MORE)

MERRITT (CONTD)
(beat)
Now we can argue about it and we can
fight about it but we cant change
it So quit pointing the damned gun
at me

Pratt keeps the gun aimed at
Merritt

Garby takes another step closer ready for action

PRATT
Why dont we wait in the shuttle
then

NOWLAN

Look at how much damage theyve done
to this room

(beat)
The shuttle couldnt take this much
damage and survive Wed never get

off the planet

Garby takes another step And Pratt swings around aiming
his gun at her

GARBY
You see Pratt were the bait As
long as theyre attacking us theyre
leaving the shuttle alone

PRATT
Man I cant take any more of this
fighting Id rather end up drifting

through the galaxy in the shuttle
then be some sitting duck for those
droids

NOWLAN
At least here we have a chance Pratt

Pratt aims at Nowlan and Garby attacks

She grabs the gun barrel twisting it up at the ceiling
BLAM
The gun discharges showering them with debris

Pratt pulls the gun back down
BLAM BLAM

The gunshots force Merritt and Nowlan to hit the dirt

She struggles pressing the gun back up at the ceiling
BLAM BLAM

Pratt pushes the gun around until it is aimed directly at

Garby His finger tightens on he trigger

PRATT
Last words Bitch

Garby looks down the gun barrel realizing shes about to
die Pratts finger continues squeezing the trigger
Garby lets go and ducks out of the way quickly

BLAM

Bullet goes wild hitting the vidmap with a shower of sparks

Merritt jumps to his feet and tackles Pratt to the floor
They crash into a work station sending it down

When they stop rolling Merritt is on top of Pratt But Pratt
still holds the gun He aims it directly at Merritts face

PRATT
Get off me Smov or Ill blow you to
hell

MERRITT
Try it

Pratt touches the gun barrel to Merritts face and pulls the
trigger

Click Out of shells
MERRITT
Youve got to learn how to count At

least as high as six

Merritt slams the gun out of Pratts hands and pins him to
the floor

MERRITT

Look Pratt were all in this
together Flesh against steel If
we start breaking up fighting each
other theyll kill us one by one

(beat)
The only strength we have is working
together

PRATT
Youre gonna throw in with that screw

MERRITT

What choice do I have What choice
do ANY OF US have

Merritt points at Nowlan

MERRITT
I may hate him I may wish him dead

Nowlan gives Garby a look

MERRITT

But the four of us are stuck here
together And were not getting out
of here any time soon

(beat)
So Ive got to learn to work with
him And work with you

(beat)
I may not like it but I dont see me
having much choice in the matter Do
you

He lets go of Pratt and moves to his feet Pratt just lays
there Finally Merritt reaches a hand down to help him up

Pratt looks at Merritts hand and reluctantly accepts

Merritt pulls Pratt to his feet then the two separate Pratt
goes off to sulk Merritt examines a cut from the scuffle

Nowlan crosses to the Vidmap Its completely destroyed

NOWLAN
No more early warning system
PRATT
(sarcastic)
There goes our advantage

Merritt goes into the wash room next to Gernsbecks office
to wash and dress his wound

INT GERNSBECKS WASHROOM -- DAY

Merritt is wrapping the cut as Garby enters letting the
door close behind her

GARBY
That was a nice speech but did it
mean anything
(beat)
Or were you just making music to sooth
the savage beast

MERRITT
Meant every word

GARBY
Especially the part about wishing
Nowlan were dead

MERRITT
I might have exaggerated

She moves closer to him serious now

GARBY
Do you really think were going to
get out of this alive

MERRITT
I dont know But I have to keep
coming up with plans and possibilities
or were as good as dead

GARBY
Then this might be my only chance

MERRITT
To do what

GARBY
To find out if what they say about
Smovs is true

She moves into his arms and kisses him gently on the lips

INT GERNSBECKS OFFICE -- DAY

Gernsbeck sees the silhouettes come together through the
pebbled glass of the connecting door

INT GERNSBECKS WASHROOM -- DAY

When Merritt kisses back Garby pulls away a little
After flirting with Merritt for years here they are about
to make love and shes not sure shed ready for it

GARBY
Ive never done it with an alien
before

MERRITT
Were all alien to somebody
(beat)
We look different we smell different
we act different
(MORE)

MERRITT (CONTD)
But even if we found someone who looked
just like us they wouldnt be us
Theyd be their own person Have
their own thoughts their own needs

(beat)

You can spend your whole life thinking
about how different you are than other
people Me Id rather think about
the ways were the same

Merritt kisses her gently

MERRITT
Smovs kiss the same as humans

They kiss again more passionately She runs her hand under
his shirt feeling his chest

MERRITT
We feel the same as humans
Another kiss They begin removing each others clothing
gently kissing each new exposure of flesh

MERRITT
We love the same as humans

Their passion flares as they kiss again bare chest against
bare chest

Gernsbeck fights harder against the restraints as he hears
intimate laughter from the next room

His voice becomes softer resigned to the fact that his
daughter is no longer under his control Maybe never was

Gernsbeck looks over to the body bag on the floor across
from him

GERNSBECK
(sotto)
Garby

Shadows flutter over the pebbled glass

INT COMMAND CENTER -- DAY
Pratt finishes barricading the windows

Nowlan watches the screens for signs of action But they
show only empty hallways A sound behind him

Nowlan spins to see Merritt exiting the washroom tucking in
his clothes

MERRITT
How much time until the shuttles

Nowlan looks at his watch
NOWLAN

A little over two hours

MERRITT
And until we run out of air

NOWLAN
About the same

Merritt nods and joins Pratt
MERRITT

NOWLAN
Sure But where do we get the power
All this equipments hard wired in

MERRITT
Batteries

Merritt points at Nowlans equipment belt

MERRITT
Theres one in your walkie talkie
Enough juice in there to slow ‘em
down for a minute or two

Nowlan unclips the walkie talkie and tosses it to Merritt
who begins to hot wire a door circuit on the control board

Nowlan looks back at the monitor
ON THE MONITOR
RALPH 124C41 holds a gun to Campbells head

RALPH

GARBY

NOWLAN

Garby looks at her fathers office making the toughest
decision of her life
GARBY

We cant get out of here without a
pilot We can wait the two hours
until the shuttles fueled but if no
one can drive it were stuck
Trapped

She turns away from the others breaking down

GARBY
Im sorry God Im sorry

Merritt raises his gun at Nowlan

MERRITT
You heard the woman We trade

Merritt switches on the microphone

MERRITT
Okay tinman We trade

Ralph 124C41 laughs

INT HALLWAY 9 -- DAY
Ralph 124C41 laughs when he sees Gernsbeck
THE EXCHANGE is like something from a Cold War spy novel

On one end of the hallway the ARMY OF ANDROIDS lead by Ralph
124C41 who holds his gun to Campbells head

On the other end of the hallway Pratt Nowlan and Garby aim
guns at the Androids while Merritt tries to control the
screaming pleading Warden Gernsbeck

GERNSBECK
You cant do this to me Theyll

kill me Dont you understand
Theyll KILL me

MERRITT
If you dont shut up Ill kill you
GERNSBECK
Please Merritt

Merritt ignores him looking at the far end of the hallway
where Ralph holds the gun to Campbells head

MERRITT
Okay We trade

RALPH
Not you The guard

MERRITT
What do you mean

RALPH
The Guard brings me the Warden
Unarmed

Merritt and Nowlan exchange looks Then Nowlan hands Merritt
his rifle and takes hold of Gernsbecks shackles

RALPH
Now

Ralph and Campbell begin advancing to the center of the hall
at the same speed as Nowlan and Gernsbeck

THE FOUR face off in the center of the hall about a dozen
feet between them Ralph keeps the gun jambed into Campbells
head Nowlan has a six shooter hidden behind his back

RALPH
This one must be pretty important if

youll trade the warden for him

Tension They cant let Ralph know how important Campbell
is They cant let him know hes the pilot

NOWLAN
Hes just a tech

RALPH
Ive never seen him before

NOWLAN
They sent him on the shuttle to look
over the computer systems for salvage

BLAM

Bang

RALPH
Computer tech Maybe we should keep
him Use him for repairs after you
have gone

NOWLAN
He salvages he doesnt repair Hes
just a junk man

RALPH

A junk man You know what he told me
He told me he was the shuttle pilot
(beat)

Now why would he lie like that

NOWLAN
Look Just let him go Ill give
you the Warden

Ralph 124C41 laughs

RALPH
No deal Well TAKE the Warden

Ralph blows Campbell away then reaims his gun at Gernsbeck
Gernsbeck starts screaming Begging

Nowlan kicks the gun out of Ralphs hands then quick draws
his pistol blasting away until the Androids dive for cover

Merritt Pratt and Garby give cover fire for Nowlan and
Gernsbeck Blasting away at the Army of Androids

Gernsbeck drags his shackles back to the group

Ralph rolls coming up with his gun He aims it at Nowlan
and the two exchange gunfire like Cowboys at high noon

Bang Bang Bang

Its a close quarters shootout like something from a John
Woo movie

Nowlan yells at the others as he fires at Ralph

NOWLAN
Back Back

The group races back down the hall to the Command Center

Nowlan takes one final look at Campbell (hes dead) then
fires a couple more shots at Ralph and joins the others in
their mad dash to the Command Center

Bullets spatter the hallways as the five run
RALPH AND THE ARMY charge after them

Gernsbeck is lagging behind dragging his heavy shackles
He trips on the chains

GERNSBECK
Help me Oh God help me

Nowlan helps Gernsbeck to his feet and they try to catch up
with the others
INT HALLWAY 8 -- DAY

PRATT GARBY and MERRITT turn the corner into the next
hallway and sprint to the Command Center doors

MERRITT

Garby slides her mag key through the slot and nothing happens
She tries it again

GARBY
Shit Its demagnetized

Nowlan and Gernsbeck round the corner racing towards them
THE ARMY OF ANDROIDS only fifty feet behind them

GARBY
Nowlan Your card

Nowlan tosses Garby his mag key then spins and fires at the
oncoming Androids

Garby catches the key glides it through the slot gets the
green light The door opens

Nowlan aims at a charging Android and pulls the trigger
Click Out of shells

NOWLAN

Nowlan DIVES and rolls down the hallway popping to his feet
next to the others

INT COMMAND CENTER -- DAY

The five dive into the Command Center closing the door behind
them only SECONDS before the Androids get there

BAM BAM BAM BAM Ralph pounds on the door
RALPH (0OS)
How are you going to get off the planet

trapped here My prisoners

Nowlan and Garby look at each other Worried

RALPH (0OS)
In less than two hours youll run out
of air

MERRITT

Two hours twelve minutes
Nowlan looks at Merritt and he explains

MERRITT
Campbells air divided by five

NOWLAN
Youre sick
MERRITT
Im practical
Ralph continues his tirade
RALPH (0S)

After youre dead Ill TAKE the
Warden Put his head on a plate

Gernsbeck begins crying
RALPH (0OS)
Then WE will fly the shuttle back to
Earth And kill every human we can
find No one will be able to stop us

Merritt puts his ear to the door listening

MERRITT
Theyre falling back
Nowlan looks from face to face Everyone has that hopeless
expression Their pilot is dead

NOWLAN
Hes right Without Campbell were
trapped He was our only chance

MERRITT
Not our only chance

NOWLAN
What are you talking about

Merritt looks up slowly

MERRITT
I can fly us out

NOWLAN
Youre full of shit convict Whered
you get your pilot license San
Quentin

Merritt moves fully to his feet standing tall

MERRITT
I used to make a good living hijacking
cargo shuttles I can fly just about
anything

NOWLAN
I hope we live long enough to find
out if youre right

GARBY
What do you mean

NOWLAN
They can kill a lot of us in two hours

MERRITT
Not if we kill them first

NOWLAN
How do you propose to do that

MERRITT
We use the Merritt System
PRATT
Whats that

MERRITT

If they attack us with guns we attack
them with cannons

NOWLAN
(sarcastic)
Great idea Where do we get the
cannons

CLOSE ON THE BROKEN VIDMAP
Merritts finger touches a location as he speaks

MERRITT
There are a couple of crates of
explosives in mine shaft number seven
We had to leave them behind when the
Deros came after us

Pratt nods remembering

MERRITT
If we can get those explosives out of
shaft number seven we can rig a bobby
trap thatll blow them into small
appliance heaven

NOWLAN
Great How do we get to shaft number
seven

MERRITT

Through the air ducts When we get
outside we can use the last rebreather
tank Theres about five minutes on
it

GARBY
Five minutes

NOWLAN
It could work

Pratt shakes his head Desperation has turned to anger
PRATT
Thats a frigging suicide mission
youre talking about Get past the
Droids get out of the complex get
to shaft number seven which we closed
because it was too dangerous hope
the damned Deros arent hungry find
the crates of explosives and sneak
them back here right past the

Droids All with only five minutes
of air Youre crazy Youre all
crazy

NOWLAN

You got a better idea

Pratt turns away

PRATT
Give them the Warden Its what they
want

MERRITT
That kills him but it doesnt save
us

PRATT

Shit This is frigging shit

MERRITT
Look Pratt weve got a choice
Hide here for two hours waiting to
die or stand and fight

Pratt turns to Merritt and nods slowly Accepting

Its obvious that Merritt has taken charge of the group
Hes become the leader by default The man with the plans

Gernsbeck raises his shackled hands towards Merritt

GERNSBECK
If youre not going to use me as a
bargaining tool can you at least
unshackle me

MERRITT
No The cuffs stay on
hard

GERNSBECK
Merritt theres three hundred of
them and only five of us Seems like
you can use all the help you can get
MERRITT
We dont need help from sadistic
mothers like you
NOWLAN
Merritt we need all the help we can
get and then some
Merritt nods slowly then looks Gernsbeck in the eyes

MERRITT
Cut him loose

Nowlan unshackles Gernsbeck tossing the cuffs aside
Gernsbeck smiles at Merritt and offers his hand to shake

GERNSBECK
No hard feelings

When Merritt moves to grudgingly take it Gernsbeck pulls
back his fist and decks him

WHAM Merritt hits the floor
Gernsbeck flexes his aching hand
Pratt makes a move towards Gernsbeck but Merritt stops him

MERRITT
I guess I had that coming

Merritt moves to his feet rubbing his jaw
MERRITT

Now that were all even its time to

choose Which one of us is going out

there

PRATT
Not me

NOWLAN
Who decides You

Merritt pulls out a huge knife and STABS it into the table
between he and Nowlan

MERRITT
The knife decides

The knife quivers in the table Nowlan nods
THE TABLE

All five stand around the table forming a circle The knife
lays in the center of the table

MERRITT
Ready

All eyes on the knife as Garby gives it a spin
PRATT
Did this when I was a kid Spin the

bottle they called it Only the winner
got a kiss

NOWLAN
No winners here

THE KNIFE continues spinning

Everyone watches as it begins to slow down blade pointing
from one to the other as it rotates

GARBY
I dont want to look

She closes her eyes
THE KNIFE stops spinning The blade has found a victim
The knife blade is pointing at PRATT

PRATT
Shit

MERRITT
This must be your lucky day

PRATT
Yeah But its all bad luck

INT COMMAND CENTER -- LATER

A rope is tied around Pratt and the rebreather (with an LCD
readout which will count down the 453 minutes of air left)
is strapped on his back

MERRITT
Ready

Pratt nods Gernsbeck claps a hand to his back

GERNSBECK
Good luck son

PRATT
Wish you wouldnt have said that
People been wishing me good luck all
my life look where it got me
NOWLAN
Youve got four minutes and fifty
three seconds of air

MERRITT
Use it wisely

This gets a smile out of Pratt who checks the action on his
gun and gets ready to go

Garby gives him a kiss on the cheek

GARBY
For luck

Pratt grabs her and plants a major-rotor-rooter french kiss
on her dipping her a little

PRATT
There Now I feel I lucky

and secures the explosives to a rolling file cart

MERRITT
When this buttons pushed everything
goes Blam

NOWLAN
Looking for volunteers

MERRITT
We do it from across the room With
a bullet I think I can hit it

VERY small target

The scratching stops and Gernsbeck opens his eyes looking
at the monitor His face shows terror

GERNSBECK
Theyre coming

How many
GERNSBECK
All of them

Biker 2s severed head waits until Merritt gets close before
it bites him on the leg

Merritt screams then PUNTs the head out the window and
returns his attention to the Lead Biker
Too late The Lead Biker charges at him

Merritt feels (Coblentzs) metal pole at his back Trapped

When the Lead Biker gets close Merritt just steps aside
Allowing the Biker to skewer himself on the pole

floor and gets an idea He snatches up a piece of broken
glass and cuts one of the stitchings

NOWLAN
Lets see what happens if I pull a
few strings

He yanks open the seam exposing Coblentzs metal insides

Coblentz picks up a chunk of fallen metal and gets ready to
brain Nowlan

Nowlan uses the broken glass to cut wires and hoses in
Coblentzs chest sparking and shorting and causing a gush
of lubricating fluid to spew out
