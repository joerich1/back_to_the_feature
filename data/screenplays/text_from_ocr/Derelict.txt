FADE IN

EXT ROAD - DESERT - DAY

Cracked asphalt whizzes along Pebbles and grit crunch
beneath tires Handlebars bounce --

We’re riding a mountain bike experiencing it through the
lens of a VIDEO CAMERA The bike cuts onto desert terrain --

A ridge lies up ahead coming up fast The bike launches off
the crest and makes a bumpy landing Legs keep pumping A
MAN laughs triumphantly from behind the lens

EXT DESERT - LATER

The bike zigzags through a maze of Cholla cactus Thorny
multicolored growths whip past Archways of low-hanging
needle-covered arms whisk overhead

He clears the cactus field and darts into an open tract

EXT FIELD - DESERT - LATER

The rider is off the bike He points the camera at his arm
Needles protrude from his skin

A MAN’S VOICE remnants of a Southern accent --

MAN’S VOICE
The dangers of playing in the
desert

He plucks needles from his arm

EXT DESERT - DAY
Boulders offer shade The camera is set down --

IAN steps from behind the lens He has an athletic
frame and sun-baked hair He pulls a water bottle from a
backpack drinks as he talks to camera --

IAN
Hey Zo Check out what you
missed It’s awesome out here and
you blew me off to go to work
Really Today of all days
I just hope by the time you see
this I’ve forgiven you
He smirks gives a boyish laugh

EXT DESERT - LATER
Ian is behind the camera laying in the shade his feet
propped up on his backpack He pans the brush-filled valley
His tone solemn --
IAN
This was my place man My go-to
to get inspired get centered I’m
gonna miss it
(a beat)
Wasn’t supposed to go down like
this
EXT DESERT - LATER

The camera sits on the ground Ian’s feet still propped on
his pack A light SNORING is heard when --

A SNAKE RISES FROM BEHIND THE BACKPACK

It slithers over the top just missing Ian’s feet and drops
to the sand

It rises as if standing Impressive beautiful and fucking
scary Just inches from Ian’s legs It spits its tongue

Then --

It lowers to the ground and WRITHES TOWARDS IAN

Scaly glistening skin brushes against a bare knee

Ian snorts

His breathing returns to normal His snoring continues
The rattler rises again then moves in --

It begins to CRAWL over Ian’s legs

Ian’s snoring sputters Stops --

Dead silence

HE’S AWAKE NOW
IAN (0S)
(softly)
Holy shit Holy shit
The snake’s long frame wriggles lazily across Ian’s legs

His breaths saw through the silence -- steady and deep

very slowly very gingerly his hand comes into frame digging
into the ground getting into position to push away

The snake’s tail drags over Ian’s legs to reveal a LARGE
RATTLE ON THE END

IAN (0S) (CONTD)
Oh God it’s a rattler Okay
Okay Keep moving Keep moving
nothing to see here
The rattler’s tail clears Ian’s legs

Ian carefully uncrosses his legs The snake’s head twists
towards him sensing movement --

IAN (0S) (CONTD)
Shit

The snake rises

Ian plants his palms ready to push away The snake’s tail
points to the sky It gives it a shake --

Its unnerving rattle emits
Ian’s breathing quickens --

IAN (0S) (CONTD)

Okay Okay One two oh

shit Come on One two
(a petrified beat)

THREE

IAN SCRAMBLES AWAY KICKING THE BACKPACK ONTO THE RATTLER

The camera is knocked around in the chaos It spins
scraping against the arid soil Falls to its side --

The snake slithers out from under the pack and pulls itself
into a tight coil

Ian’s footsteps crunch on gravel in the background
IAN (0S) (CONTD)
Whoa You see that You see
that

A rush of footfalls He scoops up the camera and brings it
in close on the snake

IAN (CONTD)
Too slow son You’re too slow

The snake flutters its rattle its head bobs It’s pissed
Ian crouches keeps a safe distance points at the snake --

IAN (0S) (CONTD)
Zo check this out See how it’s
coiled up That’s a defensive
position It uses its rattle as a

warning first
He moves away Searches a nearby brush grabs a long branch

IAN (0S) (CONTD)
You grow up playing in the woods
you come across a snake or two

He returns to the snake It’s going to town with that
rattle spits out its tongue --

IAN (0S) (CONTD)
Oh It’s spitting its tongue
Okay so a snake’s tongue is
forked The dual tips actually
taste the air from opposite
directions to find predators and
prey It hones in on their scent

Ian closes in on the rattler He prods at it with the
branch It coils tighter --

IAN (0S) (CONTD)
Yeah he’s getting pissed Watch
how fast he strikes at this stick --
Ian gives it a couple more pokes with the stick and --

WITH LIGHTNING SPEED THE SNAKE LUNGES AT THE LENS

IAN (0S) (CONTD)
WHOA SHIT

Ian scurries back almost as fast --
Seconds later he gives a laugh relieved
CUT TO
Ian brings the backpack to the lens
IAN (0S) (CONTD)
Bastard wasn’t so slow after all

Backpack probably saved my life

On the side are dual puncture wounds The fabric around the
holes glistens in the sun -- damp with venom

IAN (0S) (CONTD)
My last time out here It’s
definitely been memorable

EXT DESERT - LATER

Ian approaches a grove of cactus plants RED BULBS sprout
from thistly leaves

He slips the backpack off He pulls out a HUNTING KNIFE and
gently cuts a bulb from the leaf

IAN (0S)
Prickly pear figs They’re
delicious right off the plant

He slips the fig into his backpack Picks another

EXT RIDGE - DESERT - DAY

The earth and sky spin as the camera is placed on a rock A
jagged expanse sits beneath a small precipice

Ian enters frame sits on the ground and faces the camera
He digs into his backpack pulls out a prickly pear fig

He peels the skin bites into it
IAN
See Zo Not at all nasty I
saved you some
He taps his bag
A LOW BATTERY ICON flashes at the bottom of the screen

IAN (CONTD)
I’1l see you eat one before I go
He takes another bite looks over his shoulder at the desert
below He turns back his tone suddenly dour

IAN (CONTD)
Zoe you know you were the first
person I met when I came out here
six years ago And from the second
I told you I was going to be a
filmmaker you believed in me

He takes another bite Chews slowly choosing his words --

IAN (CONTD)
Obviously my career didn’t pan like
I hoped Through it all you had my
back Whether it was a loan or a
hot meal you made it possible for
me to chase my dream for a lot
longer than I could have on my own

He takes a deep breath

IAN (CONTD)
Deciding to move back to Virginia
was the toughest thing I’ve ever
done I’m not the type to share my
feelings you know I thought with
this tape it might be a little
easier Probably never gonna get
the chance again

He gives a weak smile musters the nerve --

IAN (CONTD)
Zo youve always been like a
little sister to me I want you to
know --

The ground TREMBLES Rocks clatter into the ridge Ian
glances around panicked The camera tumbles from its perch

IAN (CONTD)
Earthquake

He stumbles snatches the camera Points it into the valley
The quake intensifies The picture distorts

A FISSURE opens Rocks and trees collapse within

IAN (0S) (CONTD)
Whoa
The fissure tears into the distance like a jagged zipper A
plume of dust trails

IAN (0S) (CONTD)
Jesus

The earthquake dissipates
Through the haze a large oblong CRATER can be seen along the
fissure’s path Ian zooms in on it -- crust collapses Its
maw widens
IAN (0S) (CONTD)
Check that out

EXT VALLEY - DESERT - MOMENTS LATER

The LOW BATTERY ICON blinks with maddening urgency Ian
trudges alongside the fissure to the mouth of the crater

IAN
Looks like an underground cave

He pushes through the dust steps into total darkness

He hits the camera’s on board light The tiny beam is
swallowed by the black

IAN (CONTD)
Damn thing is huge

He coughs fans away dust
He pans wildly --
SOMETHING SHIMMERS FROM A CHASM BELOW

IAN (0S) (CONTD)
What the hell was that

THE BATTERY DIES
BLACK

Silence then the lens cap pops off --

INT LIVING ROOM —- IAN’S APARTMENT - DAY

A shoebox of a place Stacked moving boxes Pictures books
and DVDs litter the floor Ian sits in a chair opposite the
camera slips on a hoodie --
IAN
Okay so a couple hours ago I was
out in the Mojave and I got an
earthquake on video But the
battery died before the most
amazing part This is huge

He gathers digital video tapes shoves them in his backpack
He’s charged with manic energy --

IAN (CONTD)
It’s historic I’m gonna be the
first to document it This is my
break This is it Right here

He tosses a flashlight into the bag then zips it up He
suddenly stops quickly becomes pensive --

IAN (CONTD)
Somebody’s had to have found it by
now What if it’s not what I think
it is I could be building up a
bunch of nothing Drive out there
all that way Shit

He looks around Moving boxes stare back There’s nothing
more to lose

IAN (CONTD)
Screw it I’m going I’m gonna
need help on this so Zoe’s agreed
to come along she just doesn’t
know it yet

And with that he explodes off the chair at the lens

EXT ZOE’S HOUSE —- DAY

A modest rancher Ian hurries to the beat-up Toyota in
front Its rear sports bumper stickers promoting every
imaginable cause

One prominent bumper sticker reads “HAVE YOU SEEN ME” with
a picture of the classic almond-eyed “GREY” ALIEN

IAN (0S)
She’s home

He rushes to the front door His hand reaches out knocks
urgently impatiently knocks again
ZOE’S VOICE

The door opens to reveal ZOE with short hair glasses and facial

roll bookworm She wears a waitress

She’s torn but curiosity is gnawing away Finally --

ZOE
He’s going to be super pissed
Just a heads up

INT DINING ROOM —- ZOE’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

More a cluttered office than for dining Ian sits at the
computer where a SETIhome screensaver processes Action
figures pose on the table and shelves He pans to the
kitchen Zoe paces with her cell phone --

ZOE
I’m fine A few dishes broke
Baby listen

Ian spins back to the desk He grabs a four-armed MONSTER --

IAN (0S)
Look at this These are all Zoe’s
toys and she gets all bent out of
shape when people touch ‘em I
can’t wait ‘til she has kids

He scans the book shelf It’s packed with texts on space
lots of books on ALIENS and UFOs He slides one out on ALIEN
SPECIES gives a chuckle --

IAN (0S) (CONTD)

IAN (0S) (CONTD)
And his latest -- a headset camera

All digital All hands-free --

ZOE (0S)
‘Cause he needs our help

Ian swings around Zoe is planted in the middle of the
kitchen She sees Ian watching and turns away --

ZOE (CONTD)

INT FOYER - ZOE’S HOUSE —- DAY

ZOE
No He’s going to flip out if he
sees that Just turn it off

MARC enters He’s tall thick with a gut His dark
hair is prematurely graying He wears a jumpsuit with a
“SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WATER CO” patch

IAN
Marc hey

Marc glares at him as he drops his work belt

ZOE
Baby
Zoe hugs him He barely reciprocates

ZOE (CONTD)
Okay so Ian’s got this huge
opportunity and he needs our help --

MARC

MARC
Tell your friend it’s time to go

IAN
Bro just hear us out --

MARC
This is between me and her

Zoe quickly gets in between them --

ZOE

ZOE
Marc

IAN
Can you ask your brother to get me

ZOE
Ian shut up Marc bedroom now

She shoves Marc out of the foyer Ian storms towards the
camera -- pissed humiliated He shuts it off

INT LIVING ROOM —- ZOE’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

Zoe’s and Marc’s muffled voices penetrate the closed door
The camera is set on a table TIan’s face enters the frame

IAN
(softly)
I want to see who wins this For
all Marc’s noise my money’s on Zo

He grabs two ACTION FIGURES and returns behind the camera

He holds a busty SUPER HERO BABE in a skin-tight costume
before the lens then brings in a MONGOLOID MONSTER He
manipulates the figures to correspond with the voices --

ZOE (0S)
He’s like a brother If he needs
me I’m going to help him --

Super Hero babe smacks around the Mongoloid --

MARC (0S)
Hell always need you Don’t you
get it He’s never had to struggle
‘cause he can count on you

The Mongoloid pounds on the ground

ZOE (0S)
We count on each other

Super Hero Babe kicks him in his mongoloid nuts --

MARC (0S)
Would he give up his plans for you
When was the last time he was here
to help you out

Silence Marc’s tone calms --

MARC (0S) (CONTD)
Your heart’s in the right spot I
get it But you can’t save the
world Zoe Sometimes you’ve got
to save yourself

ZOE (0S)
I know

Ian’s enthusiasm with the dolls wanes

ZOE (0S) (CONTD)
Just go with me on this please
After tonight he’s done He’s
moving back to Virginia

MARC (0S)
You should have cut this loser off

years ago He’d be back home
already

ZOE (0S)
I felt sorry for him

Ian’s tosses the figures to the floor His hand obscures the
lens fiddles with the buttons -- Static

EXT ZOE’S HOUSE - DAY

Sunlight washes out the picture momentarily Zoe is behind
the lens She finds Marc as he carries his camera equipment
A cigarette in his mouth

ZOE (0S)
There’s the sexiest cameraman ever

He gives just about the most unenthusiastic nod ever

Ian opens his trunk Marc puts his equipment inside then
gets in the car Zoe approaches --

ZOE (0S) (CONTD)
Got your camera Ian See how you
like it all up in yours

She moves right up on Ian’s mug He turns away with a forced
smile slams the trunk shut

ZOE (0S) (CONTD)
You ready for this I’m excited

IAN
Don’t strain yourself

She gives an incredulous laugh

ZOE (0S)
What’s that about

Ian walks away

INT IAN’S CAR -— DUSK (MOVING)

Close on Zoe’s face before she spins the camera to the
window The sun dips behind desert mountains The sky
smolders pink and blue

She turns the camera to Ian who drives in silence She pans
to Marc He surfs on his phone It’s tense in here

EXT VALLEY - DESERT —- DUSK

Ian’s behind the camera He shuts his door slides his
backpack onto his shoulder

Marc slams the trunk brings his cameras to Zoe

MARC
Zoe take the headset

Marc pushes the headset into her hands then flips open the
viewscreen on his camera --

MARC’S POV His camera comes to life Zoe puts the headset
on adjusts it

ZOE
Baby I can’t work this I don’t --

MARC
Feel the headband just past the
lens there’s a button --

ZOE
What Where

MARC (0S)
(sighs impatient)
On the headband just past the
lens there’s a button --

ZOE
Wait Got it Geez

ZOE’S POV She captures Marc pans to Ian --

ZOE (CONTD)
Okay Ian we’re live What now

FROM HERE THE FILM WILL BE INTERCUT BETWEEN THE THREE
CHARACTERS’ PERSPECTIVES ONLY WHEN A PARTICULAR POV IS
CRUCIAL WILL IT BE NOTED

Ian gestures into the distance where a jagged crevice scars
the ground It widens into a GAPING CAVERN

MARC
It’s a cave He found a cave

IAN
This is no cave
EXT CAVERN’S ENTRANCE - DESERT - MOMENTS LATER

Ian Zoe and Marc approach the black maw Ian pulls the
flashlight from his backpack and hands it to Zoe

IAN
Youll need this

Ian carefully descends into the cavern Zoe and Marc follow

INT CAVERN - DESERT - CONTINUOUS

The three climb down to a precipice where the last fingers of
daylight reach Ian points to a black chasm beneath them

Rods of sunlight peek from cracks overhead They’re too weak
to illuminate the cavern but they go on forever This place
is IMMENSE

Ian whips a rock into the void A METALLIC RING echoes

MARC
What was that

Ian shrugs

MARC’S POV He cycles through various modes -- stops at
NIGHTVISION An explosion of WHITE dissolves to GREEN A
detailed picture of the chasm materializes reveals --

A SUBMERGED ALIEN SPACECRAFT

MARC (CONTD)
Holy shit No That ain’t real

It had an enormous surface area The ship’s true size
concealed by a tomb of rock

ZOE
What What Let me see

She grabs Marc’s camera Her jaw goes slack --

ZOE (CONTD)
Get out That’s not real Ian is
that is that a ship That’s a
spaceship

IAN
Did I tell you it’d be worth it

Marc takes his camera back
MARC
I call bullshit That’s a prop A
movie shot here and they left it

Ian nods then makes a dramatic LEAP off the edge --

ZOE
Ian

He lands with a ringing thud He stomps on the surface
IAN
This sucker’s for real and we
found it first

Silence as everyone realizes the implications Then --

ZOE
Wait up

Zoe climbs down onto the hull

MARC
Zoe don’t --

She bangs against it with her foot jumps up and down
Marc watches from the bluff

MARC (CONTD)
Damn it

He gives in climbs down onto the craft

Ian activates his camera’s onboard light Zoe fires up the
flashlight

IANS POV He wipes sand from the ship’s surface Its black
skin has a pearlescent sheen like oil It’s etched with
grooves and alien markings

IAN
Imagine where it came from

ZOE
Probably the Zeta Reticuli system
A lot of our UFO action is out of
there

Ian looks to her dumbfounded --

ZOE (CONTD)
I’m totally addicted to Ancient
Aliens History Channel dude

MARC’S POV With Nightvision engaged he walks along the
ship’s perimeter He maneuvers around bluffs of crust
Beyond it the cavern walls have collapsed --

AND EXPOSED THE TRUE EDGE OF THE CRAFT

An enormous segment of the ship curves in a wide arc until it
becomes trapped in rock once again

MARC
There’s more

INT TUNNEL - CAVERN - MOMENTS LATER

The collapsed wall has opened a narrow passageway beside the
craft Ian Zoe and Marc navigate down a slope following
the ship’s curvature -- descending deeper into the cavern

THE SIDE OF THE SHIP TOWERS OVER THEM

MARC
How far down does this thing go

ZOE
It had to have crashed here right
Look at the damage

Ian’s and Zoe’s lights trace along the ship’s frame It’s
horribly impacted some sections crushed collapsed

They move into a tunnel parallel with the side of the ship
Total darkness now The wall of the craft still exposed

IAN
How deep did it impact What are
we not seeing

MARC
We’re fine without knowing Let’s
head back up

The same grooves and alien glyphs are etched into its skin
Large smooth panels appear sporadically along the side

IAN
Marc just get some clean shots of
these symbols first

MARC’S POV He stops to get footage of the glyphs in
Nightvision mode Ian and Zoe move on

IAN (CONTD)
How long do you think it’s been
buried here

ZOE

(fuck)
Centuries

Ian stops dead in his tracks

IAN
Holy shit

Zoe steps beside him -- gasps softly
IANS POV One of the panels has slid open revealing
AN ARCHWAY ONTO THE SHIP

Ian and Zoe gaze through the threshold into the blackness
beyond Marc catches up with them --

MARC
Look That thing’s open

IAN’S POV He steps to the archway His onboard light barely
penetrates

He lifts a foot over the rubble blocking the opening --

ZOE
Wait You’re not going inside

IAN
A couple steps We’1ll get some
footage Come on

MARC
No Let’s stay out here

ZOE
Ian yeah It’s dark in there
Could be dangerous Not a smart
move --

IAN
It’s the only move Actual footage
of the interior This is bigger
than I hoped I’ve gotta go in

MARC
Then have at it We’re staying
here

IAN

Zo all that Ancient Aliens talk
and you won’t take a couple steps
onto a real spaceship

Marc sees she’s getting tempted

MARC
We’re staying here

Ian takes a deep breath steps over the rubble and --

ENTERS THE ALIEN SPACECRAFT

INT ENTRY CHAMBER - ALIEN SPACECRAFT - CONTINUOUS

IAN’S POV Glimpses of columns and consoles molded from the
same iridescent coal-like alloy as the exterior His
footfalls punch the silence like ripples in a pond

IAN (0S)
It’s freezing in here

INT TUNNEL - CAVERN - CONTINUOUS

Zoe moves to the archway peers inside The beam from Ian’s
light is all she sees He’s gone deeper than he promised

ZOE
Ian

IAN
Zo you gotta see this

She turns to Marc --

ZOE
It’s pitch black in there Marc
He could get hurt

MARC
He was warned

ZOE
Your camera’s got nightvision --

MARC
Forget it

ZOE
We won’t go in far Just to keep
an eye on him

Marc seethes gives in with a sharp sigh --

MARC
Stay behind me

ZOE
Ian were coming in

Marc moves past her and enters --

INT ENTRY CHAMBER - ALIEN SPACECRAFT - CONTINUOUS
MARC’S POV Nightvision captures every detail --

A massive chamber with high ceilings and curved walls
supported by a ribcage A row of columns line the center

There’s an eerie majesty to the place

Tall free-standing consoles gleam like onyx Polished
mantles bow from the walls

Marc approaches one of the mantles They hang at eye level
Their surface is lustrous free of markings

Zoe inspects the mantle beside his She gets on her tiptoes
reaches for it --

Marc grabs her hand shakes his head

ZOE (0S)
Right Duh

She pulls her hand back

IANS POV An entrenched CONDUIT runs horizontally along the
wall He pans follows it It wraps the entire perimeter

MARC (0S)
Ian seen enough

IAN (0S)
Another minute

Zoe wanders from Marc past the columns

ZOES POV Her flashlight finds an alcove with a set of FIVE
BRONZE PANELS almost the height of the wall and paper thin

Her flashlight’s beam burns BLUE on their surface

She zigzags her light across the screens A trail of blue
energy follows and fades

ZOE (0S)
Freaky

She steps closer The light passes in front of her and gives
a flash of --

A HEAD AND SHOULDERS SOMEONE IS BEHIND THE PANELS
She screams --

ZOE (CONTD)
MARC

She drops the flashlight -- CLANG
IT ECHOES WITH AN ELECTRONIC RESONANCE
Ian and Marc rush over --

MARC
Zoe

IAN
What What is it

She backs into Marc’s arms

ZOE
Someone’s behind the screens

Marc picks up the flashlight holds it like a club skulks
around the alcove and finds --

The panels are positioned just inches from the wall

MARC
Zoe there’s nobody here There’s
no way to get back here Look

ZOE
I saw someone

Ian approaches the panels

His camera’s light produces the same blue effect
He gets closer His light reveals --

HIS REFLECTION It’s distorted almost digitized

IAN
It was your reflection genius

A beat then Zoe laughs Ian chuckles Marc remains firm

MARC
Time to go

Ian goes to Zoe His footsteps ECHO with a strange
ELECTRONIC HUM He stops --

IAN
You hear that

Marc approaches His footsteps echo too Their pitch is
deeper than Ian’s

IAN (CONTD)
Wait Stop

Marc halts -- The echo fades Total silence then --
THE CONDUIT IN THE WALL FLASHES WITH A STARTLING BANG
Everyone JUMPS

IAN (CONTD)
RUN GET OUT

The three sprint like hell for the exit

Ian leads the pack Just as he gets within arm’s length of
the archway --

A PANEL SLIDES SHUT WITH A FORBODING REVERB

IAN (CONTD)
NO NO NO

A HANDLE bulges beside the door --

ZOE
Get the handle

Before Ian can reach out it retracts A cover plate slams
The seams meld into the wall like liquid

MARC
What the hell

Ian pries his fingers into the archway’s seams They fill in
as well His fingers forced out

IAN
Come on NO

The wall is smooth and bare like the archway never existed

ZOE
How do we open it How do we get
out

IAN
There’s gotta be a button or a
switch

Hands and lights scour bare walls

MARC
There’s nothing here

ZOE
We’re trapped

Terror overwhelms her voice All eyes fall on Ian He has
no answer or he just doesn’t want to admit it --

Marc rushes him SLAMS Ian into the wall

MARC
Son of a bitch You fucked us
This is your fault

Ian pushes him off --

IAN
Don’t put this on me You came in
on your own You coulda stayed
outside

ZOE
Stop

Marc’s breath pushes out in angry huffs He walks away
slams the viewscreen of his camera SHUT

IAN
Now are we gonna figure a way out
of here or lay blame
Ian collects himself He gets out his cell phone
IAN (CONTD)
Everybody check your phones for a
signal

Zoe pulls hers as Marc snickers --

IAN (CONTD)
Nothing

ZOE
No bars

MARC
This is the plan Really We’re
not going to get a signal here

ZOE
You don’t know Just look --

He shoves his cell in her face without even a peek The
screen reads “NO SIGNAL” That shuts her up on the spot

Marc turns to Ian with bridled rage --

MARC
This is all on you

He stomps off

Zoe looks to Ian He looks away

INT ENTRY CHAMBER - ALIEN SPACECRAFT —- LATER

ZOE’S POV Ian sits on the deck on the opposite side of the
chamber and swaps out the camera battery

She moves to Marc He sits on the deck smokes a cigarette
Their voices hushed --

MARC
Why don’t you listen to me

ZOE (0S)
I’m sorry But baby you’re going
to have to get your head in this
She sneaks a peek over at Ian He hasn’t noticed them --
ZOE (0S) (CONTD)
You’re the only way we’re going to
get out of here
She takes his hand in hers
ZOE (0S) (CONTD)
I know it sucks But it’s going
to have to be you
Marc stews His jaw tightens
MARC
He gets us into this and that’s

where it stops for him

ZOE
No --

Suddenly the conduit CRACKLES with a surge of blue energy
Everyone jumps hustles to the center of the room

The mantles and free-standing consoles CHIRP HOLOGRAMS
burst above them ALIEN GLYPHS cycle

IAN
What’s going on

A resonant TONE --

The five panels come back online one after another Each
produces a deep note as it reawakens Holographic alien text
hover before each screen

The three are cautiously drawn to it

ZOE
It’s like the ship’s waking up

MARC
Why now What did we do Did we
hit something

IAN
Wait Our footsteps remember
They sounded enhanced Maybe the
ship read them as a pattern

ZOE
People walking around right

IAN
So it shut the door --

ZOE
And is rebooting the systems It’s
expecting crew to take over

The five panels go dark then SPREAD APART to create a semi-
circle Each screen fires up to create --

A HOLOGRAPHIC BLUEPRINT OF THAT VERY ROOM

Each screen provides a different piece of the hologram The
last projects THREE THERMAL PATTERNS moving in real time

IAN
It’s tracking our heat signatures

He waves his arm in the air His signature does likewise
The conduit in the hologram FLASHES The conduit in the
chamber does the same The mantles and consoles go dark in

the hologram and follow suit in the room

The holographic blueprint of the chamber shrinks as the five
screens reposition themselves in a wider arc to project --

A MASSIVE SCHEMATIC OF THE ENTIRE SHIP

MARC
Look at this thing

The ship is an oblong single-level disc with countless
chambers They individually blink at a rapid pace

A rectangular BAY glows RED expands in size The rest of
the ship pulls into the background

Ian maneuvers around Zoe for a better angle He kills the
camera’s onboard light

EIGHT CYLINDERS FLASH inside the bay An array of veins
materialize beneath --
The bay falls back into line with the rest of the ship
veins spread to every chamber like a circulatory system

The ship goes opaque as a chamber at the bow throbs red
bay does the same The two flash out of sync

A network of veins between the two points stays hot
The hologram abruptly disappears The panels go dark

ZOE
What was all that

MARC
I think it was trying to tell us
the generator’s down Ship’s on
emergency juice It’s going to
have to be reset

IAN
You saw that

MARC
It was quick but it looked a lot
like charts I see at work

IAN
At the water plant

MARC
(defensive)
At the water plant

ZOE
Baby how

MARC
Power and water flow follow the
same principles -- generation

distribution control That goes
for here too

ZOE
Do you think you could figure out
how to get the generators working

Marc laughs Ridiculous --

IAN
Seriously if we can get power
restored maybe we can open that
door

The

The

Fuck it’s for real Marc stiffens They’re looking to him
MARC
No What No This is an alien

spaceship I can’t No Forget
it Find another way --

IAN
You were just bitching about a game
plan This is it It’s the same
principles you just said

ZOE
Baby just try Please

They’re not letting him off the hook He sighs --
MARC
Christ I’11 see what I can do I
can’t promise So don’t be on me

Ian nods eagerly Marc eyes him snorts --

MARC (CONTD)
At the water plant

Ian gives a sheepish smile lowers his gaze
MARC (CONTD)
How do I get another look at that
chart

Ian holds up his camera

IAN
We go to the tape

MARC
I shut mine off

Abrupt silence The momentum sucked from the room --
IAN
Hopefully I got enough
INT ENTRY CHAMBER - ALIEN SPACECRAFT - LATER

ZOE’S POV Over Ian’s shoulder as he cycles through footage
on his viewscreen Marc watches with him

On Ian’s screen is a fuzzy shot of the bay as it expands

MARC
There Pause it

He freezes the picture On screen are the eight cylinders
The network beneath the bay is illuminated --

MARC (CONTD)
Looks like these rods or whatever
stopped working

IAN
Can we get ‘em going again

MARC
We don’t know why they stopped or
how to fix them I mean where do
we start

A loud CLANK from somewhere inside the ship jolts Zoe

ZOE
What was that

MARC (0S)
See this network under the rods

Zoe refocuses Marc points at the veins beneath the bay --

MARC (CONTD)
That’s distribution That’s the
wiring carrying power all over the
ship Hit play

They move on The bay and forward chamber flash out of sync

MARC (CONTD)
See It’s making a point of
showing these two sections are not
synced up and probably need to be

ZOE
That’s the front of the ship It
has to be command

MARC
Then that’s where the main controls
should be --

IAN
So we bring the generator online
then head to command to try and
find a control to open the door

MARC
It’s going to be just that easy
sure

Ian pulls a MAGIC MARKER from his bag He consults the
ship’s schematic on his screen as he scrawls on Marc’s back

Marc jerks away --

MARC (CONTD)
Yo

IAN
We need a map You’re the only one
with a light colored shirt

ZOE
Sacrifice the shirt baby

Marc stews as Ian sketches

A BANG from somewhere in the ship It sounded close Zoe
startles looks to a LARGE DOOR across the chamber

ZOE (CONTD)
I know you heard that

MARC
They’re mechanical noises

ZOE
What if they’re not What if
there’s something on board with us

A chilling realization Marc dismisses the idea with a quick
shake of the head

ZOE (CONTD)
Ian

He glances at her then continues with the map
IAN
It’s nothing
INT ENTRY CHAMBER - ALIEN SPACECRAFT - LATER
IAN’S POV Marc and Zoe stand before the large door
Marc turns the back of his shirt sports a rudimentary map

A path outlines their route to the bay and command deck Ian
traces his finger along the map as he explains --

IAN
We’re here We’re gonna head down
the hall through this room into
another hall and right across are
the generators It’s not far We
all good
Zoe gives a tense nod Marc takes her hand --

MARC
Stay close to me

IAN
Everyone keep your cameras rolling

Marc sighs Powers his camera on

Ian moves to the door A PANEL beside it glows BLUE He
presses it --

A pair of large CLAMPS in the center of the door disengage
The two halves split at an angle with an angry HISS --

Ian Zoe and Marc cautiously enter --

INT 1ST CORRIDOR - ALIEN SPACECRAFT - CONTINUOUS

Dark and wide with the same curved walls and tall ceilings
A pulsing blue conduit travels along both walls

Debris litters their path Steam pushes from grates in the
floor and walls

IAN
Through that first door on the
right
A metallic CRASH from the dark ahead Everyone FREEZES

ZOE
Something’s here I’m telling you

The silence overwhelms Then suddenly --
THE SHIP RUMBLES

Everyone is thrown off-balance They brace themselves on the
walls Metal strains Then just as fast -- IT STOPS

MARC
Aftershock Just an aftershock

They breathe a sigh of relief and continue

They approach the wide metal door The wall and archway are
CRUSHED The conduit feeding the door is DARK

Marc hits the panel Nothing Hits it again

ZOE
Oh don’t even

MARC
No We’re getting in

The door is locked Marc tries to pry open the clamps The
stubby grips don’t budge

MARC (CONTD)
Damn it

ZOES POV In the shadows above the door the wall SHIMMERS

ZOE
What is that

Ian steps closer

IAN’S POV BLACK METALLIC LIQUID trails down the wall The
streams break into globules that seek out fractures and FILLS
THEM IN like an army of ants

IAN
My God I think the ship’s
repairing itself

ZOE (0S)
How are they moving like that
Ian ZOOMS IN -- as the gashes heal the crumpled areas of the
wall flex back into their original shape
IAN
You guys see that The walls are

moving

The globules race inside the damaged conduit and start on the
ruptured circuit

Ian moves closer The picture quickly deteriorates He
backs away the video clears

MARC
What are those things

IAN (0S)
Let’s see Zo here Don’t get
too close screws up the picture

He hands his camera to Zoe He pulls out his knife and
catches some globules on the blade They SIZZLE on contact

IAN (CONTD)
It’s like molten lead

Ian gently pulls the blade away Several droplets LEAP back
to the wall and continue on their path

IAN (CONTD)
Did you get that

ZOE (0S)
Yeah It was pretty creepy

Ian carefully brings the knife to her She gets in tight on
the remaining globules They quickly harden into pellets
They slide off clatter on the deck

A pearly residue has seared into the blade

IAN (0S)
Look what it did to the blade

The knife twitches in Ian’s grasp He loosen his grip and it
SHOOTS from his hand and CLINGS TO THE WALL

Ian is astounded He pulls it from the wall Lets it go --
the knife SLAMS right back

IAN (CONTD)
It’s magnetized

The ship groans creaks

MARC
Let’s move on

ZOE
Let’s not If the door’s repairing
itself I say we wait it out

IAN
Who knows how long that’1l take

ZOE
We should stick to the map --

IAN
Zo we just need to find an open
door We’1ll cut across and double
back It’1l be okay

She peers into the shadows ahead gives a weak nod

INT 1ST CORRIDOR - ALIEN SPACECRAFT - MOMENTS LATER

MARC’S POV He leads the pack The steam is oppressive
Visibility is dwindling

MARC (0S)
It’s getting hot

A CRASH IN THE FOG AHEAD Everyone stops

ZOE
What is that

IAN (0S)
Marc what do you see

MARC’S POV He switches to NIGHTVISION MODE
Mist obscures the lens He whip pans in a panic
FOOTFALLS SLAP ON METAL

ZOE
What is that

IAN (0S)
Marc talk to me

MARC (0S)
I can’t see

A breach in the steam just a few feet ahead A dense cloud
hovers by the wall -- unnaturally still A humanoid shape
can almost be perceived when suddenly --

IT RAISES ITS HEAD -- LARGE ALMOND-SHAPED EYES STARE BACK

AN ALIEN
Marc jumps gives a frightened yell
The alien is just over four feet tall Its bulbous head

rests on a slender frame Incisions striped across its face
A shiny film covers its flesh Eyes like orbs of blood

It shuffles to the center of the hall Its movements
arduous Its right arm dangles as if torn from its socket
It makes a sound that’s part growl part hiss

ZOE
Marc get away from it

Marc backs off The camera shakes violently in his hands --

MARC
The hell

Then RIPS from his grasp and CRASHES against he wall
An invisible force knocks him to the deck
Zoe screams JIan pulls his knife

ZOE
Ian don’t

The alien jerks its head -- Ian’s body gives a sudden SPIN
His ankle makes a sharp twist as he SMASHES against the wall

ZOE’S POV She whips from Ian’s crumpled body to the alien
It stares back gives that same guttural hiss

MARC’S POV The camera lays on the deck A hairline crack in
the lens It’s back in normal video mode The alien and Zoe
face off

A large door behind the alien SCREECHES open with a spray of
sparks The creature rushes through The doors slam shut

Zoe stays fixed on the door

IAN
Holy shit

Marc gets to his feet stunned TIan braces himself on the
wall as he attempts to stand Zoe snaps out of it --

ZOE
You guys okay

She goes to help Ian He prods her away

ZOE (CONTD)
What Let me help you

He shakes his head He can’t fully plant his injured leg
He hobbles tries not to let the pain show on his face

MARC

What was that

A beat

ZOE

I think it was a Grey
MARC

A Grey
ZOE

Whenever you hear about an alien
encounter it’s usually the Greys
people describe

IAN
How was it able to do all that

ZOE
There’s been claims that they can
move objects with their minds

MARC
How the hell are we supposed to
protect ourselves against that

ZOE
Look he seemed hurt He’s
probably scared We’re the ones
trespassing here We need to show
him that we don’t mean any harm

MARC
And what if he does

Zoe grimly considers that as Marc retrieves his camera He
gingerly touches the crack

MARC’S POV He fumbles with the camera’s controls The
screen FLASHES WHITE then goes back to standard video

MARC (0S) (CONTD)
Nightvision’s shot
(a beat)
If there’s more of those things
they’re going to be able to hide

Zoe is unnerved by the thought Ian passes her gives a
reassuring pat on her shoulder

IAN
We stay alert then

INT 1ST CORRIDOR - ALIEN SPACECRAFT - MOMENTS LATER

Ian Zoe and Marc are glazed in sweat Their shirts tacky
against their skin They move as a tight unit

MARC’S POV He shoots from beneath as he passes under a
massive ribcage

MARC (0S)

I can’t get over the size of this

place
Up ahead just before a downed bulkhead cuts off their path
is AN OPEN DOOR It hasn’t fully retracted into the wall
It’s bent as if forced open Magenta light spills out
They warily close in -- stop Who’s going to be the first
Ian looks to Zoe and Marc He takes a steadying breath then
steps into --
INT LAB - ALIEN SPACECRAFT - CONTINUOUS
A narrow chamber Huge CRYOTANKS filled with a cloudy
magenta gel are lit internally The tanks extend from the

deck into the ceiling

Ian Zoe and Marc cross through Bizarre tools and equipment
are scattered everywhere

Ian picks up an instrument resembling forceps It’s large
sharp and intimidating You don’t want to be on the
business end of these

IAN
ZO

Zoe stops to check it out Marc moves on ahead of them

IAN (CONTD)
They’re heavy

He passes it to her She needs two hands

ZOE
Wow

MARC’S POV A smashed cryotank Magenta sludge oozes

MARC
Hey Come see this

Ian and Zoe catch up Marc points to tiny slimy footprints
trailing towards the door--

MARC (CONTD)
Our friend back there must have
made a break for it

ZOE
This must be their medical bay
These are probably healing tanks

IAN
I don’t know about that

Ian motions to the next tank in line The light inside
flickers but they can clearly make out --

A GREY An arm and leg cleanly amputated Precise scars
riddle its face A portion of its skull removed porous
brain matter exposed Its chest cavity is open A web-like
ribcage spread exposing alien organs
IAN’S POV He pans to Zoe as she stares into the tank
IAN (CONTD)
Why would they butcher their own
kind like that

Her eyes stay glued on the specimen She finally looks to
him and gives a meek shrug

Marc takes her hand The three move on

They pass several empty tanks before coming to one with a
large mass inside Through the hazy gel they can see --

A HUMAN FEMALE

ZOE
Oh my God

The Female is just a teenager with a lush mane of RED HAIR
flawless skin and a SWOLLEN BELLY

ZOE (CONTD)
She was pregnant

There’s a pattern of incision scars on her abdomen Veins
plumps across the swell of her stomach

Zoe gently touches the glass She looks on with heart-
wrenched pity Stares into the girl’s lifeless blue eyes

Marc tries to usher her along She glances back at the
dissected Grey -- a glimmer of fear in her face

MARC
What

She shakes her head They continue on The three reach the
door on the opposite end The archway has been impacted
The conduit severed

MARC (CONTD)
Another dead end Come on

Ian shines his light above the door Globules are at work
Fissures fill in The wall tightens back into position

IAN
We’re gonna have to wait it out
here for the repairs to finish
MARC

Forget that Find something to pry
open the doors

Marc scrounges through the debris Zoe does the same

A GURGLING SOUND gets her attention She shines her
flashlight on an unoccupied tank

The gurgling erupts again She moves to the tank gets in
close shines her light into the murky gel Air bubbles
spurt up through the thick liquid giving off that same soft
noise Zoe breathes easy She goes to turn away when --

A SMALL CREATURE INSIDE SLAMS AGAINST THE GLASS

Zoe startles stumbles back onto the deck

MARC (CONTD)
ZOE

Marc and Ian run to her

The creature in the tank beats against the glass hellbent on
getting out Ian Marc and Zoe can only stare --

IAN
Jesus

IT’S A BABY --

A grotesque hybrid of human and alien Its flesh is scaled
Its head malformed with a ridged brow and protruding jaw
Yellow eyes with slit pupils are set deep in hollows

WISPS OF RED HAIR SPROUT FROM ITS PATE

ZOE
Is that what they took out of her

IANS POV The baby gives a tortured cry muted by the
gelatinous fluid Rows of tiny pointed teeth are glimpsed

It pushes away from the glass disappears into the murk
producing that same gurgling sound

IAN
Zoe what the hell’s going on here

She looks to Ian -- hesitant
IAN (CONTD)
These things are breeding with us
cutting up their own What do you
know about this
A beat
ZOE
I’ve never heard of Greys doing

this

The conduit flickers to life The line is repaired Several
tools on the floor light up

MARC
Finally

Marc punches the panel The door doesn’t budge The archway
is bent The wall is still repositioning itself

He tries to pry open the door with his fingers

MARC (CONTD)
Just want to get out

He gives up with a frustrated yell
The cryotanks emit a series of CLICKS and CHIRPS

Holographic alien text scrolls over the glass along with
renderings of the occupants’ skeletal frame and musculature

ZOE’S POV The baby squirms A current ripples through the
tank and puts it into instant hibernation A hologram of its
heart beats softly rapidly

An ALARM buzzes from across the lab

The tanks with the human female and the Grey FLASH Text
strobes RED The holograms of their hearts are STILL

MARC (CONTD)
What’s going on

Ian rushes the tanks Zoe follows --

IAN
It knows they’re dead

A WHIRRING sound The gel is sucked from the bottom of both
tanks A sequence of BEEPS then --

A pressurized HISS Sand trickles onto the corpses --

The sequence of BEEPS accelerates It repeats faster each
time like a countdown until it becomes a steady DRONE

Ian steps back moves Zoe with him Then --
CLANK CLANK CLANK CLANK
A METALLIC BARRIER unfurls around both tanks

The specimens are quarantined An alien HAZMAT symbol
rotates before each unit

Ian and Zoe exchange looks

Marc turns back to the door The archway is repaired Metal
droplets scurry back into ducts in the wall

He hits the panel The doors split with a growl
MARC
Were out
INT 2ND CORRIDOR - ALIEN SPACECRAFT - MOMENTS LATER

Zoe Marc and Ian race through steam Sweat drips Ian
favors the one leg as he brings up the rear

IAN’S POV Marc’s shirt is saturated The map streaks Marc
slows comes to a stop

ZOE
Baby you okay

He pants barely able to speak

MARC
So God damned humid

IAN
Slow deep breaths Marc

Zoe goes to take his hand Marc pulls it away --
MARC
Just give me a minute Okay
INT 2ND CORRIDOR - ALIEN SPACECRAFT - MOMENTS LATER

IAN’S POV He and Zoe are down the hall Marc is far behind
them leaning against the wall trying to pull breath

ZOE
He’s not looking so good

Ian glances back at him concerned

IAN
Well get him through --

ZOE
I can’t carry him myself

IAN
It won’t come to that I got you

ZOE
With that ankle

IAN
It’s fine I’m here for you

She nods not all that convinced

IAN (CONTD)
Marc you good

Marc throws a thumbs up his breathing a bit more steady

INT 2ND CORRIDOR - ALIEN SPACECRAFT - MOMENTS LATER

The three approach a set of huge double doors pried open by
an enormous pile of debris An alarm sounds from inside

IAN
This is it
MARC

Clear away some of this crap

Ian sets down his camera They clear the smaller fragments
Marc struggles

ZOE
Don’t overdo it baby

Ian moves a heavy piece of bulkhead

IAN
Whoa What is that

Zoe and Marc rush to him Buried within the rubble are THE
SKELETAL REMAINS OF A LARGE ALIEN

The bones in its arms are thick with clawed hands It wears
a carbon fiber-like chest armor

Its partially collapsed cranium is oblong with faintly
humanoid features Its jawbone protrudes with dual rows of
razor teeth A ridged brow arcs over deeply set eye sockets

MARC
Do you know what that is

Zoe’s not saying Ian’s face goes stern his tone hardens --

IAN
You need to tell us what you know
Right now

All eyes (and cameras) on Zoe She can’t avoid it anymore
She stares at the remains --

ZOE
This isn’t the Grey’s ship I have
a bad feeling it belongs to a
species called Reptilians

Ian and Marc exchange looks -- she fucking serious

IAN
Reptilians Lizards

ZOE
They’re similar yeah lLeathery
skin cold-blooded and if there
are any alive on board things just
got a lot worse

MARC
Worse

ZOE
Their whole thing is conquering
weaker species Experimenting on
them cross-breeding Brutal
stuff If they’re any here
they’re not going to let us off
this ship

Silence as it all sinks in Then --

IAN
Why would you wait to tell us this

ZOE
I wanted to be sure first

Ian eyes the corpse even decomposed this thing looks
imposing He turns back barely concealing his unease --

IAN
We stick to the plan It’s all we
can do

INT FUEL CELL BAY - ALIEN SPACECRAFT —- MOMENTS LATER

ZOE’S POV She and Marc wait as Ian climbs over the debris
and enters He grunts as his injured leg pushes off

The bay is three stories of grimy industrial pipes and
chains Red light pulses from beneath the metal grate deck
The conduit throbs red along with it

Ian Zoe and Marc gaze into the bay

MARC
You’ve got to be kidding me

Toppled on the deck are seven ENORMOUS FUEL CELLS --
cylinders twelve feet tall

A bronze-like frame with a transparent shell showcases the
inner workings A rusty pinion along the top and bottom

Four CRADLES on raised pedestals line each side of the bay
One cell at the far end remains precariously in its hold

MARC (CONTD)
These are the power source we saw
on the map We have to find a way
to get them up into those slots

He motions for Ian to follow They PUSH on a cell It’s
like pushing on a parked SUV Marc shakes his head

MARC (CONTD)
These things aren’t going anywhere

ZOE
Something has to move them right

Ian sizes up the place He heads to a mass of chains hanging
against the wall and tugs They pull taut An oily blue
substance coats his palm

Marc and Zoe kick debris from their path as they head into
the bay Their lights scan the walls and ceiling --

MARC
There’s got to be a crane or pulley
system here

As Ian follows he spots a large CHROME PISTOL on the deck
He squeezes the trigger nothing He tosses it back

THE BAY RUMBLES Debris jumps Slides

ZOE
Aftershock

A loooooo0cong CREAK Everyone stops slowly turns to see --

The cell sitting in the cradle on the end -- SWAYS
IAN
Oh shit
Everyone watches waits The aftershock subsides Calm

returns The cell regains balance

ZOE
Thank you thank you thank you

As they breathe a sigh of relief --

THE CELL TOPPLES ONTO THE DECK

It ROLLS down the bay and SLAMS into another That one
CRASHES into another A stampede thunders towards the group

IAN
RUN

They haul ass back to the door as eight cells ride their
heels The pinions gnash the deck Sparks shoot

Consoles at the base of the pedestals hurl violently across
the bay as the cells SMASH through them They fly overhead
Ricochet off the walls --

MARC
Jesus

Ian hobbles along Marc gasps for air --

ZOE
Guys the ladder

Zoe jumps onto a ladder descending from the last pedestal
Ian and Marc keep running She makes a frenzied climb and
narrowly avoids being crushed by the cells

ZOE’S POV She watches the cells tear a path of destruction
from the safety of the cradle

Ian and Marc run for the end of the bay A cluster of chains
hang against the wall ahead --

IAN
Climb the chains

IAN’S POV The camera dangles from his wrist Flashes of the
deck Ian’s legs Then --

BANG

The camera knocks against the wall The deck pulls away as
Ian CLIMBS the chains

BOOM

The first cell IMPACTS just beneath them TJIan’s grasp slips
He catches himself Scales back up

IAN (0S) (CONTD)
HANG ON

MARC’S POV The camera hangs from his forearm points down
His feet dig into ridges in the wall as he pulls himself up

ZOES POV The cells pile up against the wall Ian and Marc
just barely climb above them

The last cell hits and rebounds into the wreckage pinning the
doors open --

The debris EXPLODES out into the corridor --
THE DOUBLE DOORS CLANG SHUT

IANS POV The camera dangles just above the mass of cells
He pulls it into his hand turns it on Marc

Marc’s face is red pouring with sweat

IAN (0S) (CONTD)
Good hustle

And Marc actually laughs

Static --

Zoe remains on the pedestal

ZOE (0S)
Guys it got so quiet

Shes right The alarm has stopped The deck and conduit no
longer flash red

Ian whip pans to the door they first entered

IAN (0S)
The door’s are closed

The deck plate and power conduit bloom with AMBER LIGHT
A ROAR builds like a jet engine firing up

Ian whips around the bay The howl increases engulfs them
Marc lands on the deck Nervously glances around

IAN (CONTD)
Zoe get down here

ZOE’S POV She’s about to climb down when --

Slots within the concave wall of the cradle burn WHITE

The silver chains around her neck pull taut at the cradle
wall Her belt buckle drags her in She tries to fight it --

ZOE (OS)
Marc Marc

She gives a tortured cry as piercings explode from her face
and shoot into the cradle

She is YANKED against the wall after them -- hits hard She
struggles to push away The force overpowers pins her

IAN
Zo

Ian and Marc bolt into the bay The equipment on the deck
rises FLOATS around them They stop Their planted feet
slide towards the center

They try to back away it’s like trudging through quicksand

MARC
I can barely move

Momentum builds Debris swirls in a vortex pattern Marc is
snapped towards the growing maelstrom He tries to resist
He hits the deck clutches the grate

Ian drops to his knees grabs the bottom rung of the ladder
at the base of Zoe’s cradle He white knuckles it as --

His legs are thrust over his head towards the vortex
ZOE’S POV She turns over her back pinned to the wall

She sees Marc and Ian being pulled towards the cyclone

BOOM

She snaps her head towards the sound The cells crash into

one another as they roll back into the bay right at Marc
ZOE

Marc look out
IAN’S POV His camera is taut around his wrist pointed right
at Marc who grips the deck at the bottom of the frame The
cells thunder backwards about to crush him --

Marc sees them coming --

MARC
Shit

He lets go and is instantly sucked up into the swirling mass
just missing the power cells as they tumble across the deck

ZOE’S POV Marc ragdolls helpless amid a spiral of debris

The cells bounce end over end up into the vortex They
levitate in a halo pattern -- knocking into one another

MARC’S POV Debris races past Fragments ping off the lens
He jukes and ducks away from large pieces and jagged ends

A metallic shard slices across his arm

MARC (CONTD)
ow

Blood floats from the wound in tiny droplets
ZOE’S POV Ian is RIPPED into the vortex

ZOE
Ian

He SLAMS against a cell -- bounces into another braces
himself against it on impact

Ian maneuvers around the cell His hands carefully find hold
in the pinion’s teeth as he works his way to Marc

MARC’S POV Ian clutches the side of the cell Behind him
two others collide with a flash of sparks One of the cells
heads at Ian --

MARC (0S)
Behind you

Ian sees he’s about to be crushed He kicks off like a
swimmer as the cells SMASH together

ZOE’S POV An electric HUM surrounds her The glow inside
the cradle intensifies

The power cells slow down each twirls before a cradle

IAN’S POV Marc floats nearby He moves out of camera range
as he hovers between a power cell and its cradle

Grim silence then it begins --

At the far end of the bay the first two power cells float
side by side both aligned with opposite cradles when --

WHOOSH

One of the cells is SUCKED into its cradle with the force of
an incoming train A deep CLUNK as it locks into place

MARC’S POV He got that on camera

MARC (0S) (CONTD)
Oh no No no no

He’s two cells away He points the camera forward The
cradle is dead ahead He spins --

The power cell is behind him out of reach He’s trapped in
mid air helpless with nothing to push off from

CLUNK The second cell locks into its hold

The first two cells are in place Six to go

ZOE’S POV A cell spins in front of her cradle seconds from
liquefying her She inches herself along the concave wall

her fingers clawing into the ridged surface

IAN’S POV He sees Zoe struggle --

I can’t move Please

CLUNK The third cell LOCKS into position One more then
Marc is toast

Ian whips his camera to Zoe She’s making no progress

IAN
Oh God

Ian scans the debris floating around him He grabs at them
There’s nothing of use He swats them aside

Then he sees it -- a long PIPE floats nearby He reaches
it’s just out of range

CLUNK The fourth cell is in its cradle Marc’s next

MARC
Ian

Ian clings to the cell by his fingernails and stretches
his fingertips graze the pipe

IAN
Come on

It slowly spins He rolls it into his hand -- Fuckin’ A

IAN (CONTD)
Marc catch

He hurls the pipe Marc snatches it out of the air

IAN (CONTD)
Yes

Marc jams the end of the pipe against the cell just as it
LAUNCHES AT THE CRADLE

He pushes off spins from its path as it locks into its hold

Ian kicks off from his cell He fires across the bay comes
to a hard stop on the cell hovering before Zoe

CLUNK The cell beside Zoe locks into position

ZOE’S POV She nears the cradle’s edge Blood smears her
fingers as they drag her along JIan scales around the cell

ZOE (0OS)
Ian

CLUNK The cell directly across from her fastens into its
hold She’s next --

IAN
Keep going

ZOE (0S)
I won’t make it

Ian leaps onto the cradle The concave slot sizzles white

Ian is sucked in He catches himself on the outside edge of
the cradle He reaches -- clasps Zoe’s hand

IAN
I’ve got you

He PULLS THE FINAL CELL EXPLODES AT THEM Zoe screams --
CLUNK

The cell hits with bone-crushing force Zoe’s cries stop
instantly tIan’s hand rips loose

The vortex deteriorates Debris crashes to the deck Marc
drops with a painful thud

Ian tumbles off the platform

INT FUEL CELL BAY - ALIEN SPACECRAFT —- MOMENTS LATER

MARC’S POV The conduit blazes with WHITE LIGHT The cells
are in their cradles Pinions grind gears spin

Marc stands with a woozy groan Small lights on many of the
tools on the deck are now illuminated

MARC
We got power Guys we got power

A victorious laugh as he quickly pans The bay is empty

MARC (0S) (CONTD)
Zoe Ian

IANS POV The camera lays on his chest his face askew in
frame His eyes are closed

IAN
Yeah

MARC (0S)
Ian You okay Where’s Zoe

His eyes spring open --

IAN
Zo

No response Ian scrambles to his feet He points the
camera at the platform above

IAN (0S) (CONTD)
Zoe Zoe Oh no Zoe

Only the churning fuel cells answer back

IAN (CONTD)
God no

Just then blood-streaked fingertips feebly reach from over
the edge of the platform

IAN (CONTD)
Zo

He climbs up to the cradle --

Zoe is crumpled next to the power cell She looks up dazed
A glimmer of relief as she focuses --

ZOE
Ian

He picks her up --

IAN
You’re okay She’s okay

She hugs him tight kisses his cheek Tears break
IAN (CONTD)
Zo we did it We got the power

back on

MARC
We’re almost home baby

BANG The cell beside them RUPTURES Blue smoke gushes
Blue oil spits A SIREN blares --

IAN
Down the ladder

They scurry down to the deck
AN ELECTRIC FORCE FIELD ERUPTS AROUND THE CRADLE

Ian and Zoe are cut off Noxious vapor fills the compartment
as Marc rushes to them --

IAN (CONTD)
Marc were trapped

MARC
I got you

He grabs the pipe he used earlier sets the camera down --

MARC’S POV He sizes up the electric field then SWINGS at it
with all he’s got --

A crackle of sparks The pipe explodes from his hands with a
twang and launches across the bay

The force field remains
ZOE’S POV Vapor fills the chamber fast Ian turns to her

IAN
Hold your breath

He and Zoe suck in deep JIan sorts through the debris on the
deck There’s nothing of use then --

A white glow burns through the blue smog JIan snatches it --

The chrome pistol he picked up earlier The tip of its
scorched barrel glimmers

IAN (CONTD)
Marc get back

Marc takes cover JIan points the pistol at the forcefield
squeezes the trigger --

Only it’s not a gun

The barrel’s tip flares white hot It vibrates in Ian’s
grasp It’s a tool A torch A PLASMA TORCH to be exact

Ian gives it a once-over He brings the tip to the
forcefield pulls the trigger --

An eruption of sparks His arm jolts back That’s not going
to work either

Zoe coughs struggles to speak --

ZOE (0S)
Ian the floor

Ian fires up the torch and BURNS THROUGH THE DECK

Marc watches as Ian cuts out an escape hatch Beneath the
deck is a narrow duct of pipework He grabs Zoe

Marc disappears behind a wall of blue vapor --
IAN
Marc stay here We’1l come back

for you

Ian crawls into the duct Zoe follows

INT DUCT - ALIEN SPACECRAFT - CONTINUOUS

IAN’S POV Low and tight Pipes sweat He belly-crawls
pushes his camera along His and Zoe’s wet coughs rattle
their confines

IAN (0S)
Zo you okay

ZOE (0S)
I think so What about Marc Ian

A beat

IAN
Well get him We’1l get him

A BURST OF STATIC

INT DUCT - ALIEN SPACECRAFT - MOMENTS LATER

IANS POV The duct dead ends at a VENTILATION GRATE A
brilliant plume of searing light washes out the frame as Ian
carves through it

The grate collapses Ian crawls into

INT CREW CHAMBER - ALIEN SPACECRAFT - CONTINUOUS

Zoe emerges from the duct She and Ian take in the
surroundings Dark and cavernous Shrouded in fog The
power conduit burns in the mist

They cautiously head into the chamber

Within the low-hanging mist they come to --

Two large Reptilian carcasses sprawled on the deck Their
bodies decomposed They wear the same flexile armor

IAN
Two more How big a crew would a
ship like this have

Zoe gazes uncomfortably into the distance She turns to him
chilled points ahead --

ZOE
About that many

Ian points his camera in that direction Across the chamber
through the haze are --

A DOZEN CRYOCHAMBERS LINED AGAINST THE CURVED WALL

Similar to the floor-to-ceiling models in the lab only more
ornate and not filled with fluid The glass panels on FOUR
units glow from within A MAMMOTH SILHOUETTE IN EACH --

IAN
Oh shit
(a beat)
They’re in hibernation right
They’re asleep

ZOE
I think they’re going to be awake
soon

IAN

What makes you say that

ZOE
The temperature’s been rising The
ship is getting the environment
ready for them We’re running out
of time Ian

IAN
Let’s find the door

He grabs Zoe’s hand They burst past the cryochambers
A BEEP Ian and Zoe freeze --

Three cryochamber doors swing open with a HISS
IAN (CONTD)
(hushed)
Back into the duct

They hurry back Fog displaces obscures the wall

ZOE
Where is it

An animalistic SQUEAL Ian and Zoe turn The silhouettes
inside the open cryochambers stir

A DARK FIGURE sets out a burly unsteady leg
ZOE (CONTD)
(hushed)
They’re going to see us

Ian pulls her to the carcasses With a low rushed tone --

IAN
Get under the body

ZOE
What

IAN
Hide 1I’11 be right next to you

The silhouette of an oblong shaped head with a broad mandible
pokes out from the second cryochamber His eyes glint in the
sparse light like an animal’s

Zoe reluctantly shimmies beneath the Reptilian remains
Petrified tissue crumbles

ZOE
Ew

Ian climbs under the one beside her The body disintegrates
as he disturbs it Petrified tissue blows like dust

IANS POV Through the mist he can see Zoe beneath the
carcass and the cryochambers beyond

THE FIRST REPTILIAN EMERGES FROM HIS HOLD --
He’s HUGE - over seven feet tall with powerful arms and
legs He is mostly concealed by fog and darkness but a

glimpse of his scaled flesh reveals a green pigment

IAN (0S)
Oh my God

Zoe turns to Ian Her eyes wide

The Reptilian stumbles braces himself on the wall His legs
rubbery His equilibrium affected by the cryo-stasis

His wet raspy breathing fills the room

The other two Reptilians climb from their cryochambers --
The second Reptilian is just as massive as the first
Cryochamber lights gleam off his sleek brown hide Talon-
like clawed feet tap against the deck

The third Reptilian is just over six feet The runt of the
pack He stretches his lithe frame silhouetted in the

conduit’s glow

All three aliens have difficulty walking They communicate
by shrill squawks and clicks

Zoe looks to Ian and in a barely audible voice --

ZOE
I want out now

The runt Reptilian opens a compartment at the base of his
cryochamber The scant light gives a hint of maroon flesh

He pulls three packs that hold what resembles pink dog food
He hands them out -- each of the Reptilians squeeze the vile
contents down their throats voraciously slurp it up

An ALARM sounds Holographic glyphs hovering above the
fourth lit cryochamber throb RED

IAN’S POV He zooms in on the green Reptilian as he goes to
the fourth cryochamber The occupant’s vitals are flat The
hologram of his heart motionless

The green Reptilian manipulates the text Wipes segments
away draws new glyphs in the air that register as holograms

IAN
Wow

A hiss Sand filters into the cryochamber Pebbles rattle
against the glass

A countdown of BEEPS begins intensifies to a hum Finally --

A metallic barricade unfurls around the cryochamber That
same hazmat-like symbol spins above the surface

The Reptilians head to the corner where a set of five bronze
panels float A schematic of the ship materializes

The green Reptilian touches the hologram it expands --

The three aliens squawk to one another as they cycle through
various chambers on the ship by touching the schematics

ZOE
(whispers )

Please just go just go just go

The green Reptilian minimizes the ship A rendering of the
cavern and the rock the craft is entombed within hovers

The room is silent then --

MARC (0S)

IAN ZOE WHERE ARE YOU

IAN
(hushed)

No Marc shut up Shut up

The Reptilians go into a FRENZY They bolt to a dark corner
their stride still shaky The doors part they rush out

IAN (CONTD)
What the hell is Marc doing

ZOE
Ian they’re going after him --

THE DOOR OPENS WITH A RATTLING CLANK

IAN
Shh Shh
The red Reptilian is back Ian and Zoe go completely still
The alien’s husky breathing and the taps of his claws on the
deck pervades the room He goes for the cryochambers
IAN (CONTD)

Don’t
His features

IAN’S POV He zooms in on the alien
Then --

frustratingly concealed by mist and shadow

The alien deftly drops beneath the fog
IAN (CONTD)
Shit
Ian follows along with the disruptions in the haze as the

Reptilian silently crawls Then --

He loses the alien’s trail

Ian swings the camera back to Zoe Terror on her face
Suddenly -- the Reptilian’s dark shape rises behind her
ZOE’S POV Ian’s eyes go wide as he looks past her

IAN’S POV Zoe clamps her eyes shut She knows what’s
coming

The alien’s head turns methodically as if tuning into their
presence Then --

HE SPITS A FORKED TONGUE TASTING THE AIR FOR THEIR SCENT

IAN (CONTD)
Oh I know what you’re doing

The Reptilian has a fix on Zoe He lurks towards her his
tongue flailing wildly

Ian pushes the camera aside his leg now in frame He slips
his foot out of his sneaker and peels off his sock

A fossilized claw hangs contorted at the side of the frame
He SNAPS it off at the wrist and shoves it into the sock

He points the camera towards Zoe The Reptilian looms over
her She’s about to be discovered --

Ian LOBS the sock across the chamber
BANG It hits the far wall

The Reptilian spins towards the noise His tongue laps at
the air tasting the sweat from Ian’s sock

He bolts across the chamber and searches frantically for his
prey

The two Reptilians call out The red shrieks back He gives
one last glance in Ian’s direction then hurries out

Ian releases a pent-up breath

IAN (CONTD)
It’s gone

ZOE
What about Marc

INT 3RD CORRIDOR - ALIEN SPACECRAFT - MOMENTS LATER

MARC’S POV He pushes through steam clouds Pipes drip
Conduits on both sides flicker with a smoky glow

His breathing is fast short His arms glazed with sweat

MARC
ZOE IAN

A NOISE from the dark from just around the next corner It
almost sounded like a CLICKING noise

He warily approaches

MARC (CONTD)
Guys

A DARK BLUR ERUPTS FROM THE SHADOW --

Marc barely gets out a scream -- a hand covers his mouth
It’s Ian
IAN
(hushed)

Sshh We’ve got problems

Ian removes his hand Zoe is behind him

ZOE
There are Reptilians here
MARC
What
IAN
We have to be quiet Let’s see the
map

Marc turns His shirt is saturated The map is SMEARED
Unreadable Zoe is crestfallen

ZOE
Oh no

A Reptilian shriek rings from behind them

IAN
Move We’ll figure it out

They push on

INT 4TH CORRIDOR - ALIEN SPACECRAFT - MOMENTS LATER

ZOE’S POV Ian leads the pack Zoe holds Marc’s hand He
stops wheezing ready to pass out

IAN
Marc you gotta keep moving

ZOE
Please baby
MARC
I can’t can’t catch my breath

Zoe looks to Ian He hooks an arm around Marc’s back --

MARC (CONTD)
No Don’t carry me

Zoe hurries to Marc’s other side and helps support him The
three are on the move again it’s awkward and slow

MARC’S POV His camera points at the deck His legs are
weak His feet barely plant

Ian’s legs are in frame His injured ankle trembles with
each step His pained grunts can be heard

MARC (CONTD)
I’m sorry I’m sorry --

Another Reptilian cry cuts through the hall They pick up
the pace as best they can

INT 4TH CORRIDOR - ALIEN SPACECRAFT - MOMENTS LATER

The hall branches into three directions

ZOE
Where do we go

Ian’s finger draws the map in the air Zoe is worn out She
leans against the wall pans to the darkness behind them --

IAN
To the right

He hooks his arm under Marc They turn right into a side
corridor --

IAN (CONTD)
No No No Back Go straight

ZOE
You sure

IAN
Yeah yeah

They double back head straight down the corridor

INT 4TH CORRIDOR - ALIEN SPACECRAFT - MOMENTS LATER
They come to a stately door Larger than any of the others

IAN
This has to be it

Ian and Zoe sit Marc on the deck
Ian hits the panel It’s LOCKED The clamps engaged
Marc closes his eyes exhausted Zoe rubs his arms

ZOE
Stay with me baby

His eyes flutter He takes her hand gives it a gentle kiss

The plasma torch erupts with a crackle of white hot energy
That gets Marc’s attention

Ian burns into the clamps

MARC
How’d you get that to work

IAN
See the conduits along the wall
They transmit energy all over the
ship -- supply power to all the
systems the tools

MARC
Like a wi-fi signal

The first clamp drops to the deck

IAN
Only here it’s wireless energy
You lose a conduit and anything
feeding off it dies

MARC
Howd you figure that out

IAN
Tell you on the way home

Zoe nervously looks down both ends of the corridor Pings
and knocks ring out from the dark

ZOE
You almost done

The other clamp drops

IAN
We’re in

Ian and Zoe pry fingers into the seams and PULL

The door stubbornly splits They part it enough to squeeze
through

Zoe moves to help Marc He waves her off and stands a bit
unsteady

They follow Ian as he wedges through the crevice

INT COMMAND DECK —- ALIEN SPACECRAFT -— CONTINUOUS

An enormous amphitheater Free-standing consoles line
descending tiers The ship’s schematic rotates before a
mammoth set of panels at the bow

Ian and Zoe push the doors shut He bounds down the levels
for the panels Zoe and Marc remain by the door

ZOE’S POV She scans the room The conduit throbs with white
energy Grates in the floor and the wall spew steam

Ian touches the ship’s hologram -- it RIPPLES like water

IAN
I should be able to access this I
saw them do it What the hell

MARC’S POV He pans the room all the consoles project the
same red glyph

MARC
Might have to be reset it Likea
breaker Look for an access panel

Ian checks consoles on the lower tiers His onboard light
reflects across their pristine surfaces

Marc inspects the middle tiers No luck
Zoe clears the upper level Nothing

ZOE
Where is it

MARC’S POV In a corner on the lower tier a BEACON flashes

MARC
Ian what’s that

He points and makes his way down He and Ian rush to it

A disc-shaped lever bulges from the console An amber ring
blinks

IAN
What do you think

Marc shrugs Ian nervously places his hand over it
IAN (CONTD)
(mutters)
Please

He presses it The amber ring goes dark Then a BEEP

A deep hum surges through the room The consoles erupt with
holographic TEXT PLANETS and STAR CHARTS

IAN (CONTD)
Got it

ZOE
Yes

The holographic ship blooms Every chamber fully mapped

MARC
Get that door open

Ian rushes to the hologram Their individual heat signatures
materialize in the forward chamber

He reaches for the schematic his hand stops cold --

THREE BLUE SIGNATURES RACE TOWARDS THE BOW OF THE SHIP

IAN
They know we’re here They’re
coming
ZOE
Forget it Let’s go --
MARC
No
IAN

This is the only chance we’re gonna
get at this Zo

Ian taps the ship The model freezes He retraces their
steps

IAN (CONTD)
Where did we come in Where

(a beat)
I think it’s here
He touches a section -- it explodes in size The rest of the

schematic pulls to the background The chamber they
initially entered floats before him

IAN (CONTD)
We’re in

ZOE
Hurry

THE REPTILIAN SIGNATURES SEPARATE EACH TAKES A DIFFERENT
CORRIDOR --

IAN
They’re splitting up

ZOE
We need to go

MARC
No Ian do what you got to do
I’m watching ‘em

Marc moves to the side eyes the Reptilians as they maneuver
through the ship

Ian traces his finger across the chamber His digit’s point
of contact magnifies a small area of the schematic

IAN
Where’s the door

The Reptilians’ signatures flank the bow of the ship They
come at the Command Deck from parallel corridors

MARC
They’re around the corner Coming
up fast --

ZOE
Tan

Ian drags his finger through the hologram --

MARC
Hurry man Gotta hurry

ZOE
We need to go Guys now

Ian moves his finger along the chamber’s wall
Two Reptilian signatures turn the corner They come at the
Command Deck from opposite ends The third makes a straight
shot up an intersecting hall
MARC
They just turned the corner Zoe
get away from the door

ZOE’S POV She steps back --

MARC (CONTD)
It’s gotta be now

Ian’s finger moves along the wall undeterred

IAN
It’s not coming up --

Suddenly -- AN OUTLINE OF THE DOOR APPEARS

IAN (CONTD)
Wait I got it

He pulls his finger away The door DISAPPEARS

IAN (CONTD)
Shit What happened

Ian touches the wall again The door reappears
ZOE’S POV Footfalls pound through the walls

They’re right outside

Zoe rushes the door and punches the panel The clamps on
their side engage She jumps back

Ian double taps the holographic door It flashes with a
rewarding electronic TONE He pulls his finger away --

THE DOOR REMAINS HIGHLIGHTED

IAN (CONTD)
It’s good Go Go

Ian and Marc bound up the tiers

ZOE
Were cut off

A Reptilian shrieks from the other side of the door

The Reptilians attempt to open the door The clamps remain
engaged More frenzied squawks

MARC’S POV He frantically pans the room

MARC
Find another way out

The panel flashes The Reptilians are overriding the door
from the other side

IAN
They’re gonna get in

Zoe snatches the plasma torch from Ian’s waistband

IAN (CONTD)
Zoe

She goes to a grate on the back wall Burns through it
They’ve got a new escape route

ZOE
Hurry

She crawls into the vent
The door chirps Clamps disengage

Ian pushes Marc to the duct Ian crouches in the fog waits
as Marc shimmies his stout frame inside it’s a tight fit --

IAN’S POV He catches the door at an odd angle shrouded by
mist It splits open The Reptilians enter

Their tongues flick madly They stop onto something they
taste it in the air

Marc finally clears the duct
Three Reptilian heads turn in unison towards Ian --

Under the cover of fog he quietly slips into --

INT VENTILATION SHAFT —- ALIEN SPACECRAFT - CONTINUOUS

IAN’S POV He pushes his camera along as he belly crawls
Sporadic columns of light from grates overhead

IAN
Another second I would have been
lizard chow back there

Marc creeps ahead breathing hard

IAN (CONTD)
Marc

MARC
I’m okay

MARC’S POV Zoe fires up the torch throwing harsh light

through the confined space The walls rattle as she burns
through another grate

INT 4TH CORRIDOR - ALIEN SPACECRAFT - CONTINUOUS

ZOE’S POV Zoe and Marc wait in the corridor as Ian emerges
from the vent Marc is hunched over sucking in wind

ZOE
That’s the way back

She points They haul ass

The overhead lights die Section by section down the
corridor Only the conduit’s glow remains They stop

A Reptilian SHRIEKS That sounded way too CLOSE

IAN
That came from behind us

ZOE
No no That was up ahead

IANS POV He slowly pans the onboard light doesn’t reveal
much There’s nothing in front of them

He nervously spins the light behind them --
The corridor is empty
He turns back to Zoe --

IAN
Zo gimme the torch

ZOE’S POV She hands it off Ian holds it up listens
It’s deathly still He squeezes the trigger --

The tip flares --
ILLUMINATING THE GREEN REPTILIAN LOOMING OVER HIS SHOULDER

A glimpse at its facial features as the alien shrieks
blinded Ian jumps

The camera spins There’s screaming Chaos --

IAN (CONTD)
RUN

They tear down the corridor Feet pound metal --

They turn the corner into --

INT 3RD CORRIDOR - ALIEN SPACECRAFT - CONTINUOUS

Overhead lights are working The doors to the fuel cell bay
dead ahead The cells churn like the ship’s heartbeat

IAN
Straight through
INT FUEL CELL BAY - ALIEN SPACECRAFT - CONTINUOUS
They explode inside The doors slam tight The clamps lock
Eight cells grind away -- the defective one repaired The
forcefield is gone Blue mist hovers in the rafters

spitting ink-colored condensation

Marc and Zoe tread across the bay hands clasped together
Ian follows his eyes on the door behind them

ZOE’S POV Her and Marc move towards the open door ahead

ZOE (0S)
We’re almost there baby

Yeah not so fast --

The fog up ahead STIRS Dual trails appear from behind two
cradles and zero in on them

ZOE (OS) (CONTD)
Ian

Patches in the fog give a peek at the red and brown
Reptilians as they nimbly crawl towards them --

IAN
Get back

A RUSTY SCREECH

Ian whips to the door behind him The green Reptilian slowly
enters Ian gets his first good look at the creature --

His scaled flesh is deep green with stripes of blue His
face is elongated with a broad thick jaw slits for nostrils
and round eyes set in ridged sockets

He wears the same carbon-fiber body armor His arms and feet
exposed

Marc pulls Zoe behind him He hastily feels the deck and
comes up with a metal shard He holds it like a shiv

Marc steps back pushing Zoe with him

The red and brown Reptilians’ heads break just above the
mist Steely inhuman eyes stay on Marc --

MARC
Take it

Marc shoves his camera into Zoe’s hands At that instant the
Reptilians close in He slashes at them --

MARC (CONTD)
Get away

With astonishing speed the brown Reptilian leaps and TACKLES
him Zoe crashes to the floor She drops the flashlight it
spins off into the mist

ZOE
MARC

Marc and the brown Reptilian thrash and roll The alien pins
him quick like an alligator with its prey

IANS POV He stares down the green Reptilian He whip pans
to Marc A blur of limbs in the fog as he fights the brown

Ian spins back to the green -- he’s moved in closer

ZOES POV The red Reptilian torpedoes for Zoe beneath the
mist She backs up butts against a pedestal

Marc stabs the brown Reptilian in the shoulder A spray of
MUSTARD COLORED BLOOD A high-pitched squeal

MARC
Son of a bitch That’s right

Marc jabs repeatedly Most of his shots miss or impact on
the body armor The brown Reptilian cries out --

The red Reptilian changes course -- zeroes in on Marc

IAN
Marc look out The other one

The red LUNGES He grabs Marc’s arm brandishing the weapon
A SICKENING SNAP OF BONE

Marc’s screams overpower the throbbing power cells

ZOE
NO

Blood sprays His cries excruciating

ZOE (CONTD)
(horrified)
MARC
IANS POV He fires up the torch The green draws back

And Ian makes a break for Marc The red and brown Reptilians
slither away under by fog

IAN
Marc were here Get up man

Ian slaps his hand around Marc’s forearm Marc attempts to
stand collapses Coughs up blood His hand goes slack

IAN (CONTD)
MARC

Marc’s body is a heap of shredded meat Organs exposed
intestines spilled The carnage tastefully shrouded by fog

IAN (CONTD)
Oh Jesus No

Zoe pulls up beside him She gets a glimpse of the gore --

ZOE
Baby Oh my God

She bawls goes for Marc Ian holds her back Grief floods
her voice --

ZOE (CONTD)
Let go of me MARC

IANS POV The green Reptilian slips beneath the fog Ian
pushes Zoe towards the door She fights him --

IAN
Go

ZOE
NO HELP HIM HELP HIM

IAN
He’s gone Move or we’re dead too

Two pairs of bestial eyes reflect from the shadows

IAN (CONTD)
Go

She reluctantly moves They bolt for the door

ZOES POV She looks behind them The green Reptilian
catapults from the fog and OVER THEIR HEADS

ZOE
Ian

The green springs off a power cell and SLAMS DOWN in front of
the door Ian and Zoe screech to a stop The Reptilian
gives an unnerving growl as it closes in

Ian fires up the torch The green Reptilian stops

IAN
Yeah Back away

Ian and the alien circle each other He and Zoe inch towards
the door

ZOE’S POV She whips her head across the bay The brown
Reptilian skulks towards her --

His claws slick with blood White stripes cross his hide
He has deep set opal-like eyes with vertical pupils

The red Reptilian rises from the mist beside him His maroon
flesh is striped with orange His eyes like jade

All three aliens wear the same impenetrable body armor
Zoe lets out a soft hopeless gasp
Ian spins towards them The red and brown reptilians halt --

IAN (CONTD)
Don’t

The brown Reptilian reaches with a clawed foot for something
on the deck He brings his foot up -- a metal pole clutched
within it He passes it to his hand

The green Reptilian ATTACKS --

Ian spins Strikes with the torch The Reptilian nimbly
weaves retreats

Now’s their chance Ian takes Zoe’s hand They rush to the
door When --

The brown Reptilian launches the pole like a spear It
crashes against the door panel The doors snap shut

IAN and Zoe barely make it through and crash into --

INT 2ND CORRIDOR - ALIEN SPACECRAFT - CONTINUOUS
The two painfully collapse on top of piles of debris

Ian scrambles He engages the locking clamps and slices the
conduit feeding the door

Zoe is on her hands and knees Her face slick with tears
She looks to the door clenches her eyes anguished --

ZOE
I’m so sorry baby

She quietly sobs Ian sees the blood on his palm smeared on
his forearm

IAN
(compassionately)
Zo we have to move
BANG The Reptilians pound on the other side of the door

IAN (CONTD)
Please That door won’t hold long

She collects herself stands determined to finish this
Marc’s camera dangles from her wrist She yanks it free
shoves it into Ian’s ribs and moves down the corridor

A metallic clank Hydraulics exhale The door OPENS

against the crust

I don’t know The aftershocks
The ship must have shifted settled
into the crevice

What do we do

His voice is weak all the hope and fight drained from him --

ZOE (0S)
Where are you going

He locks the clamps then torches the conduit The consoles
and lights cut out The torch gasps and dies

digs into his bag

IAN

No granola but how about

He pulls out the cactus fruit he picked earlier

IAN (CONTD)
How hungry are you

He tosses her one She peels away the threads Her face
somber exhausted She bites into it with no reservations

IAN (CONTD)
Told you I’d get you to eat one of
those someday

She chews mindlessly They eat in silence Finally --

IAN (CONTD)
I wasted my life All these years
out here were bullshit I never
tried I think I knew I just
didn’t have it in me You knew it
too

She is shocked by his candor

IAN (CONTD)
You felt sorry for me like you had
to look after me

ZOE
Ian everything I did was out of
love for a friend It wasn’t pity

IAN
Whatever you want to call it I
took advantage of it and never
cared about the consequences for
either of us

Her eyes well up She looks away

IAN (CONTD)
My life was over before I even
found this place I dragged you
down with me
(a painful admission)
This is all on me he was right

IAN (0S) (CONTD)
We saw the ship run vitals on the
dead girl and the Grey Before it
sealed them up I saw what looked
like sand fall into the tube

ZOE
Sand

IAN
When the Reptilians came out of
their tanks one didn’t make it
Same thing happened before he was
sectioned off Sand and rocks fell
into the tube

ZOE
From the roof of the ship

IAN
What if a hatch at the top of the
tank opened up so they could
jettison the dead bodies

Her eyes light up --

ZOE
If the tanks run straight up to the
top it’s possible In space the
vacuum would suck them right out

IAN (0S)
But underground those tanks are an
escape tunnel

A ray of hope The energy comes flooding back --

ZOE
So wait We just have to get into
one of those tanks and climb

IAN (0S)
It’s not gonna be that easy First
we have to get a tank to run a scan
on a dead body

How

How does he break this to her

IAN (0S)
We have to kill a Reptilian

Her newfound enthusiasm just got flushed She looks back to
the hologram with despair

You and me It’s the only shot we
have of getting out of here

Like it or not it’s all they’ve got left

ZOE
So what do we do

IAN (0S)
Remember the room with the
Reptilians’ tanks

She brings up the Reptilian’s Crew Chamber The line of
cryochambers clearly visible

IAN (0S) (CONTD)

BANG BANG
The car bounces bottoms out HARD He keeps going

A deep THROBBING sound builds The car shakes violently
Magenta light suddenly drowns the landscape

Zoe looks out the passenger’s window --

In the distance the ground collapses A SINKHOLE the size of
a stadium forms A column of magenta light pierces the sky

ZOE (0S) (CONTD)
Oh my God Ian

The Reptilian ship EXPLODES from the ground Massive crusts
of rock break off the craft and smash to the ground

She looks to Ian Terror takes his face as he gazes over his
shoulder

The colossal ship lifts into the sky It’s black skin
covered in hundreds of blazing lights A glowing ring on its
underbelly throbs from white to magenta

Suddenly a wide beam of green energy bursts from the craft --

It scans the desert floor like a floodlight and STOPS just
ahead of the car --

ZOE (0S) (CONTD)
LOOK OUT

SCREECH Ian tries to swerve but the beam follows his path
intercepts and ENGULFS THE CAR

The engine cuts off instantly --
The car is lifted off the ground pulled up towards the ship

IAN
Open the door Get out

They frantically try to open their doors --
BUT THEY WON’T BUDGE
Zoe peers out the window The car is gaining altitude fast

IAN (CONTD)
Out the window

She scrambles from her seat Ian is right behind her pushes
her along The car sways as they move

IAN (CONTD)
I’ve got you Go

EXT IAN’S CAR -— CONTINUOUS

Zoe pulls herself out the broken window Pained grunts as
remaining shards tear into clothing and flesh

She’s pressed against the side of the car trapped under the
force of the beam staring at the ground -- 30 feet below

ZOE (0OS)
I can’t move

She snaps her head towards the ship looming closer

Zoe turns her head back watches the ground as it pulls away
She sees the beam’s edge cuts off at the bottom of the car
Zoe reaches for it it’s like moving through sap and moves

her hand beyond the light It’s free from the beam’s hold

ZOE (0S) (CONTD)
We have to get beyond the light

IAN
GO HURRY

She belly crawls It’s difficult to move She keeps sliding
back Her muscles tire

Then she feels a PUSH She looks behind her Ian leans out
the window and shoves her with all he’s got left --

She moves beyond the beam’s hold -- and FALLS She clings to
the bottom of the car She looks up -- Ian is pinned down
against the door He’s spent but his eyes focus on her

IAN (CONTD)
Drop You’ll be alright

ZOE (0S)
Well go together Hurry

IAN
Go You hide ‘til it’s safe

ZOE (0S)
Ian no You can make it

IAN
I love you

He’s finished she knows it With that she releases her grip
and gives a piercing scream as she plummets over 30 feet

BOOM She hits the sand Her headset camera jostles

She moves -- slowly painfully Stifled cries as she drags
herself to the cover of some shrubs

A slanted view of the Reptilian craft as it sucks Ian’s car
through the underbelly’s glowing ring

The ship glides directly overhead The surrounding desert
glows in its running lights

As the craft passes by --

The green light bursts from the underbelly

Zoe startles

Ian’s car launches from the ship and CRASHES onto the ground

ZOE (0OS)
Ian

She whips from the car back to the ship just in time to see
it tear off into the atmosphere with unbelievable speed
EXT DESERT - DAWN

ZOE’S POV As the sun breaks over the mountains sand and
pebbles crunch beneath tired footfalls

Zoe approaches the collapsed metal heap that was Ian’s car
The windows are blown out Tires exploded

She peeks inside --
No sign of Ian not that she expected there to be

She circles the wreckage -- catches a glimpse of the backpack
and camera wedged under the console

She stops A trembling hand presses against the hood She
slumps to her knees

Zoe collapses against the car a desolate expanse stares
back She begins to cry Finally a release

Her sobs quickly build to an anguished crescendo

FADE OUT
