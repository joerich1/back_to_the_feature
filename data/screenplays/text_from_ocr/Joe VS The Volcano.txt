Big thanks to Marty for making the copy available

This was scanned from at least a 2nd generation
photocopy The OCR software did an admirable job of
recognizing most of the characters More errors were
caught during editing and through spell check The
formatting of the document was badly mangled and has been
recreated to match the original at least superficially
The bulk of this editing work has been performed in
Microsoft Word for Windows

The page between pages 27 and A28A was damaged on the
original-- the left 40 of the page was blank At this
time I have not attempted to fill in the blanks

Some spelling errors present in the original document
were left in for authenticity (focussed travellers
for examples) I personally feel it gives more of the
original flavor

Greg--

I read the entire script with an eye for finding
missingmisspelled words etc At every error I fixed it
if it was VERY obvious If it was only mildly obvious or
if I was taking a wild guess I made the change but I
marked the word(s) involved If I had a quetion about a
word I marked it I marked word(s) with and changed
the font color to red To see all the questionable bits
just use the FIND feature and search for every
(theres only 20)

Thanks for letting me work on this with youand thanks
for making this script available to the group

GREY SCREEN
The TITLE appears in white letters -

JOE VERSUS THE VOLCANO
MUSIC Borodins Polovtsian Dances Chicago Symphony
Orchestra begins to play The stormy part

The CREDITS ROLL

The credits have that depressing shitty this is going
to be one of those lousy black and white movies from the
1950s look This is going to be one of those cheap teen
sci-fi movies about a creature

MUSIC When the female stars name appears Borodins
theme which will later become adapted into Strangers In
Paradise plays Then we return to the stormy part
which subsides as

The CREDITS END
The following LEGEND appears on the field of grey
You only live twice
Once when youre born
Once when you look death in the face

-- James Bond

The LEGEND remains but the field of grey turns to a rich
texture of solid gold

MUSIC The Girl From Ipanema sung by the likes of Tom
Waits sung like it was the Downest blues song anybody
ever croaked out just before the final curtain The
MUSIC starts as the field turns from grey to gold The
MUSIC PLAYS ON

EXT AMERICAN PANASCOPE CORPORATION - DAY
Were in color now but its a grey world Its an ugly
building about the size of a city block and a couple of
stories high Its surrounded by hurricane fence topped
with barbed wire Outside the fence is a muddy parking
lot On the fence is a sign that reads

AMERICAN PANASCOPE CORP

a subsidiary of

ACHI

JOE VERSUS THE VOLCANO - Rev 51689 1A

The sign also has an abstract logo a sortve German
Expressionists version of a lightning bolt Another
sign reads
HOME OF THE RECTAL PROBE

Its a grey winters morning Its raining or snowing or
it just has or its about to Theres a guard at a gate
nodding workers inside the fence They trail listlessly
past him and continue on their way to the buildings
entrance Most of them carry or are using grey or black
umbrellas Since they are coming from the parking lot
and since the entrance to the building is still almost a
city block away once inside the fence this straggling
line of workers stretches hundreds of yards Some of the
workers wear hats

We see the line of workers FROM HIGH OVERHEAD
The line is in the same shape as the lightning bolt logo

One of these workers is JOE BANKS Joe is in his early
thirties Hes wearing a beat-up black trench coat
under the trench coat hes got on a cheap and square
jacket and tie This is a depressed man You can see
where he could be cool where he could have something on
the ball But hes way too beaten down and depressed to
be cool Joe steps in a puddle He pulls his shoe out
of the water He notices the sole is coming loose from
the shoe This depresses him further He walks on The
sound of the WATER SQUISHING in his shoe can be heard
JOE VERSUS THE VOLCANO - Rev 11589 2

INT PANASCOPE BUILDING - DAY

Joe is shuffling down the main walk in the building On
his left are doors leading to offices On his right is
the factory which has the feel of an airplane hangar
The factory is separated from the walk on which Joe
progresses by a heavy wire fence twelve feet high Joe
passes by a sign on this fence that says Shipping This
area is filled with thousands of brown cardboard boxes a
shipping clerk among these boxes pulls a lever ona
device the device spews out several feet of wet brown
tape Joe continues on He passes a sign on the fence
that says Canteen This area contains a row of vending
machines and two long tables a guy who looks like hes
going to die is sitting at one of the tables eating pink
Hostess snowballs he eats them in a slow dismal way as
if they were giant sleeping pills Joe continues on He
passes a sign on the fence that says Quality Control
This is the biggest area its filled with workers in
shower caps and worn white jackets they work a distance
apart from each other at long tables they are
inspecting terrifying medical instruments One of these
workers a middle-aged woman named Sally attaches a
catheter to an air pump The catheter inflates and
finally explodes Sally seems satisfied Joe continues
on his shoe distantly SQUISHING He stops at one of the
office doors on his left The lettering on the door
reads

ADVERTISING DEPARTMENT

Joe opens the door and goes in The SONG ENDS

INT ADVERTISING DEPARTMENT - DAY

The place is lit with those totally draining deadening
fluorescent lights DEDE a secretary in her late
twenties is sitting at her desk typing Shes pretty
maybe a little hard

JOE VERSUS THE VOLCANO - Rev 51689 3

She types like an automatic weapon Her makeup doesnt
really work under these lights She nods briefly to Joe
and goes on with her typing Joe tries to hang up his
hat but it keeps falling off the hook He is endlessly
patient Its the sound of the typewriter that makes him
miss At last he succeeds Behind Dede at a bigger
desk is MR WATURI Hes leaning back in an executive
chair talking on the phone Hes middle-aged olive
skinned in a dark suit that shows up his significant
dandruff His teeth are yellow as rancid butter And
theres enough grease shining on his forehead to coat a
skillet Hes talking into the phone

WATURI

Yeah Harry but can he do the
job I know he can get the
job but can he do the job
Im not arguing that with you
Im not arguing that with you
Im not arguing that with you

Mr Waturi waves absently at Joe and goes on talking into
the phone

WATURI
Who told you that No I
told you that Me What
Maybe Maybe Maybe

Joe hangs up his coat on the coat rack and goes to the
coffee set-up at the rear of the office He snaps a
disposable plastic coffee cup into a permanent plastic
holder He puts a spoonful of instant coffee in the cup
Then a spoonful of powdered creamer Then two spoonfuls
of sugar He takes a plastic stirrer and stirs the
powders He pours in the hot water and stirs Little
clumps of undissolved stuff rise to the top Joe tries
to break them up with the stirrer and partially succeeds
He feels the glands in his throat Maybe theyre a
little swollen He rubs his eyes Theyre burning a
little He takes his coffee and walks past Mr Waturi
and into his own office

INT ADVERTISING LIBRARY - JOES OFFICE - DAY

The same fluorescent lighting Theres a small wooden
desk which has on it an old electric typewriter and an
out-of-place lamp its a lamp Joe brought from home The
rest of the office is almost entirely taken up with grey
industrial shelving On these shelves are brochures
depicting various medical instruments Samples of each
brochure are taped to the appropriate shelf Behind
Joes desk is a pipe that runs floor-to-ceiling and is
painted fire-engine red

JOE VERSUS THE VOLCANO - 51689 4

In the center of this pipe is a big wheel valve Hanging
from this valve is a printed metal sign

The sign reads THE MAIN DRAIN Another sign reads Do
Not Touch Joe turns on the lamp which casts a small
ring of golden light and sits down with his coffee He
takes off his shoe and examines it He tries to huddle
close to the lamp like a cold creature trying to get
warm Dede comes in

JOE
Good morning Dede

DEDE

WATURI

Not good enough Joe Not

in charge of the entire
advertising library

JOE
You mean this room

WATURI
I gave you carte blanche how
to deal with the materials in
here

JOE
You put the orders into the
printer Mr Waturi not me

Thats how you wanted it

WATURI

Youre not competent to put
the orders into the printer
Thats a very technical

JOE
I thought you were going to
explain it to me

WATURI
I was going to do better than
that I was going to make you
assistant manager I want to
make you assistant manager
But you youre not flexible
Youre inflexible

JOE
I dont feel inflexible

WATURI
Youre inflexible Totally
And this doctor appointment
Youre always going to the
doctor

JOE
I dont feel good

WATURI

So what Do you think I feel

with my job

JOE
What do you want from me Mr
Waturi

WATURI

Youre like a child Whats

JOE
These fluorescent lights
affect me They make me feel
blotchy puffy I thought
this light would

WATURI

Get rid of the light This
isnt your bedroom this is an
office Maybe if you start
treating this like a job
instead of some kind of
welfare hospital youll shape
up And I want those catalogs

JOE
Then please order them

WATURI
Watch yourself Joe Think
about what Ive said Youve
gotta get yourself into a
flexible frame or youre no
place

He starts to leave but stops and looks back

WATURI
Take that light off your desk

JOE
I will

WATURI
Take it off now

Joe unplugs the light and takes it off his desk

WATURI
Good

Waturi leaves Joe sits at his desk shrinking in the
fluorescent light He sips his coffee The PHONE RINGS
and he answers

JOE
Advertising library Fifty

many in stock I dont know
why The catalog is a
thing I dont know Its

He hangs up the phone Dede has quietly come in Shes
looking at Joe She speaks to him in a low voice

DEDE
Why do you let Waturi talk to
you like that
JOE
Like what

DEDE
Whats wrong with you

JOE
I dont feel very good

She looks at him Shes frustrated with this guy This
is somebody who she could go for but hes just lying
there like a dog waiting to be kicked He looks at her
If he had the strength if he were feeling a little
better hed make a play for this woman But hes
helpless He just doesnt feel very good Absently he
feels the glands in his throat

DEDE
Whats the matter with you

JOE
I dont know

She stares at him Shes angry frustrated She turns
and walks out Joes eyes are shining with tears that
will not fall He is powerless to help himself He
mutters to himself fierce and impotent

JOE
I dont know

He presses the heels of his hands into his eyes

INT DOCTORS WAITING ROOM - DAY

We discover Joe with the heels of his hands pressed into
his eyes This room is fluorescently lit too and
perhaps at first we dont realize we have gone somewhere
else A nurses voice is heard

NURSE (0OS)
Mr Banks Mr Banks

Joe startled takes his hands from his eyes The CAMERA
PULLS BACK and we see were in a doctors waiting room
And now we see the NURSE She is a very conservative
WASP Nurse

JOE
Yeah

NURSE
Doctor Ellison will see you
now
JOE VERSUS THE VOLCANO - Rev 51689 9

INT DR ELLISONS OFFICE - DAY

The lighting in the doctors office is the first warm
relaxing light weve seen It comes from lamps and a
little frosted window The office itself is full of old
wood and books DR ELLISON sits in a comfortable chair
at an old desk He is the last word in doctors Hes a
large respectable distinguished greyed-haired MD
Hes a specialist You get the feeling he may be a
genius

ELLISON
How are you feeling Mr
Banks

JOE

Pretty much the same I feel
puffy blotchy I never seem
to have very much energy I
get these little sore throats
I just dont feel good

ELLISON
And how long have you felt
this way

JOE
Well Pretty much since I
left the Fire Department On
and off But since then
Bout eight years

ELLISON
What did you do in the Fire
Department

JOE
Well ah you know I put out
fires

ELLISON

Was it dangerous

JOE
Yeah Ahm pretty rough
stuff But I came out of it
okay The hard part was not
feeling good all the time I
started not feeling good all
the time So I hadda quit
Ellison nods
ELLISON
Yes Ive gotten the results

of your tests

JOE VERSUS THE VOLCANO - Rev 6289 10

JOE
Ive got cancer

ELLISON
No

JOE
This new venereal

ELLISON
No
JOE
Is there something wrong with
my blood or urine or
ELLISON

No theyre fine But there
is something

JOE
Tell me

ELLISON
You have a brain cloud

JOE
A brain cloud

ELLISON
Theres a black fog of tissue
running right down the center
of your brain Its very
rare It will spread at a
regular rate Its very
destructive

JOE
And its incurable

ELLISON
Yes

JOE
How long
ELLISON
Six months You can pretty
much count on it being about
that Its not painful Your
brain will simply fail
Followed abruptly by your
body You can depend on at
least four and half or five
months of perfect health

JOE VERSUS THE VOLCANO - Rev 6289 11

JOE
But what are you talking
about Doctor I dont feel
good right now

ELLISON

Thats the ironic part
really Mr Banks youre a
hypochondriac Theres nothing
wrong with you that has
anything to do with your
symptoms My guess is your
experiences in the Fire
Department were extremely
traumatic You experienced
the imminent possibility of
death Several times

(as Joe nods numbly)
You survived But the
cumulative anxiety of those
brushes with death left you
habitually fearful About your
physical person

JOE
Im not sick Except for this
terminal disease

ELLISON
Which has no symptoms Thats
right It was only because of
your insistence on having so
many tests that we happened to
discover the problem

Joe laughs a little maniacally then stops abruptly

JOE
What am I going to do

ELLISON
Well if you have any savings
you might think about taking a
trip a vacation

JOE
I dont have any savings A
few hundred bucks Ive spent
everything on doctors

ELLISON
Yes Perhaps youll want a
second opinion

JOE
A brain cloud I knew it
Well I didnt know it but I

knew it

JOE VERSUS THE VOLCANO - Rev 51689 12

ELLISON
Yes
JOE

What am I going to do

ELLISON
You have some time left Mr
Banks You have some life
left My advice to you is
Live it well

JOE
Ive got to go Im on my
lunch hour which is over

Joe gets up and Ellison follows suit putting out his
hand

ELLISON
Im sorry for what I had to
tell you I wish the news had
been better

Joe doesnt take his hand

JOE
Yeah

Joe leaves Ellison starts to sit down Joe comes back
in

JOE
Im sorry I didnt shake your
hand

Joe takes the doctors hand and shakes it Then he drops
it and exits abruptly Ellison sits there a moment not
moving Then he opens a drawer in his desk and takes out
a flask He pours himself a drink and begins to drink
it

EXT MEDICAL LEAGUE BUILDING - DAY

This is the building Ellisons office is in Joes car
is parked out front Joe comes slowly out Its still
overcast but lighter and dryer than it was earlier As
Joe walks down the steps an elderly woman approaches
with her dog Molly a mutt Joe sees the dog and stops
fixed on it He pats the dog on the head The elderly
woman thinks this is nice

Then Joe embraces the dog and kneeling down hugs it
intensely The elderly woman is alarmed and pulls the
dog away Joe looks after them

table

DEDE

JOE
I bribed them to sing a song
that would drive us insane and
make our hearts swell and
burst

Whereupon the three guys with guitars arrive at the table
and launch into an extremely passionate Castilian love
song The song makes conversation impossible Joe pours
Dede some more red wine They toast looking into each
others eyes The scene ends but the SONG CONTINUES

receding They kiss and look again The song continues

the hall

INT JOES KITCHEN - PREDAWN

Joe is making some real coffee Hes changed into
bathrobe Hes got a little lamp on not the overhead
light He opens the refrigerator and takes out a loaf of
white bread He puts a couple of slices in the toaster
Then he looks at his little tin dining table and at
window The window is so dirty its opaque Youd like
to open it to see out He pulls the table over to
window Then he pulls a chair over to face the window
The window looks out on a long little street At the end
of the street is a brightness where the sun will be He
brings his coffee to the table and a napkin andaa
spoon He hears the TOAST POP He gets it puts it ona
plate butters it and brings it to the table He sits
down He takes a sip of coffee and a bite of toast He
looks out the window The sun is just starting to come
up He looks at the coffee at the little whiff of steam
rising from the cracked cup The cracks in the shape of
ACHI logo He looks at the toast with one bite missing
and the butter melting into the golden bread He looks

at the suns splendid red rim These things are so
beautiful His eyes well up He takes another bite of
the toast and another sip of the coffee and looks at the
rising sun Its so great that hes here to experience
these things and so sad that hes leaving He goes back
to the refrigerator and takes out the loaf of bread He
puts a couple of more slices in the toaster and the

the plate next to him The sun has risen a goodly bit
and can no longer be seen by us But Joe is dappled with
sunlight He is no longer in the thrall of a big
emotion but he is extremely deep in the thought The

satisfied the doorbell is ringing He gets up and out

Graynamore strikes an enormous match and lights up

GRAYNAMORE

Joe pulls a bottle of cheap scotch out of a cabinet
along with two glasses He pours them both a drink and
sits down Graynamore downs his whiskey which makes his
eyes glitter all the more He leans forward and speaks
with great intensity

JOE VERSUS THE VOLCANO - Rev 6289 26

GRAYNAMORE
eres an island in the South
acific called Waponi Woo The
ame means The Little Island
ith the Big Volcano The
aponis are a cheerful people
o live a simple existence
ishing in the lagoon and
icking fruit They have one
ear Thats a big volcano
ey call it The Big Woo They
elieve an angry fire god in
e volcano will sink the
island unless once every
hundred years he is appeased
Its been ninety-nine years
eleven months and eleven days
since the fire god got his
propers and the Waponis are
scared

tothomMes SSB UH

JOE
Hows the god appeased

GRAYNAMORE
Of his own free will a mans
got to jump into the volcano
Now as you might imagine none
of the Waponis are anxious to
volunteer for the honor of
jumping into the Big Woo And
the problem is that whoever
does it gotta do it of his own
free will so what do you do

JOE
What do you do

Graynamore gets up and starts to move around the room
GRAYNAMORE

You do some tradin Theres
a mineral on that island Mr

Banks Its called bubureau
I dont know anywhere else on
the planet where you can find
more than a gram of this
stuff and believe me Ive
looked Because without
bubureau I cant make my
superconductors Ive tried
to get the mineral rights from
the Waponis but I dont seem
to have anything they want
But they do want a hero Mr
Banks And theyll give me
the mineral rights if I find
them one

JOE
Why would I jump into a
volcano

JOE VERSUS THE VOLCANO - Rev 6289

Graynamore lets go of his shoulders

GRAYNAMORE
From your exploits in the Fire
Department I think youve got
the courage

JOE

twice traverse a staircase in

eap into the mouth of a

PATRICIA
I love my sister I know
shes screwed up I love my
father even though I never
see him and hes not so great
when I do see him Im very
nervous about this trip My
father didnt tell me anything
and you dont seem to be
telling me anything But its
more than that Ive always
kept clear of my fathers
stuff since I got out on my
own Now hes pulled me back
in He knew I wanted this
boat and he used it and he got
me working for him which I
swore I would never do I feel
ashamed because I had a price
He named it And now I know
that about myself I dont
know who you are I dont
know anything about you But
youre working for him too
and that makes us two of a
kind I could treat you like I
did back on the dock but that
would be me kicking myself for
selling out Which isnt fair
to you and doesnt make me
feel any better I dont know
what your situation is But I
wanted you to know what mine
is Not just to explain some
rude behavior But because
were on a little boat for a
while and Im soul sick and
youre gonna see that Like
my sister Shes soul sick
too And if youd slept with
her I wouldve known something
about you But you didnt
You didnt I believe you

She departs through the entrance way The light goes
out and its dark and quiet

EXT STERN OF THE TWEEDLE DEE - DAY 78

Its a really beautiful sunny day Tony is at the wheel
the sails are full and sitting in two chairs hard by the
stern are Joe and Patricia They both are holding deep
sea fishing rods theyre trolling

MUSIC

The Girl From Ipanema the famous recording by Getz and
Gilberto is playing now

Patricia reels in her line A beautiful fish is flapping
on the end of it Joe reels in his line Nothing He
watches as Patricia unhooks her catch and tosses it ina
hamper Dagmar appears looks in the hamper and nods
approvingly Then she looks at Joe Wheres Joes fish
Then he walks away again Joe casts again while
Patricia rebates her hook Then Patricia casts again
Mike arrives with a beer for Patricia who accepts it
Mike leaves Patricia gets another strike asks Joe to
hold her beer which he does She reels in another
beautiful fish She unhooks it and throws it in the
hamper Dagmar appears looks in the hamper nods
approvingly and then looks at Joe Wheres Joes fish
Joe looks at Dagmar and then ignores her Dagmar
departs Joe goes back to fishing Now Joe gets a
strike Its a big one The line goes burning out his
reel Patricia notices She offers to help him He
waves her off Dagmar appears She offers some advice
But Joes completely focused on his rod The rod which
is substantial starts to bend Mike comes back to
watch The rod is almost bent double Then it goes
madly to the left Offers of help are made but Joe
shouts them back Then the rod goes madly to the right
Dagmar runs OUT OF VIEW and reappears with an enormous
gaff which she brandishes excitedly A sudden powerful
tug almost pulls Joe off the back of the boat but Mike
grabs him just in time Joe is a man possessed He
reels and pulls with superhuman determination Without
warning a huge head the head of a hammerhead shark
appears at the stern Its eyes turn inboard and look at
Joe Everybody drops everything and runs away

EXT DINING TABLE - TWILIGHT 719

The sun has just sunk beneath the horizons rim so
theres still all that sun setting light in the sky The
first evening star has appeared Joe and Patricia are
the last left at the dinners end The bones of the fish
Patricia caught earlier are on a platter at the tables
center Mike appears and removes the platter and a couple
of stray plates and disappears into the galley There
are balloon glasses by Joe and Patricias places and by
Patricia a bottle of cognac
PATRICIA
Do you like cognac

JOE
Cognac

PATRICIA
Yeah

JOE
I guess so

PATRICIA

I make a point of not knowing
about certain things One of
thems cognac I like cognac
But I dont want the accepted
wisdom about cognac you know
what I mean I mean I want
glimpses of the myth about it
You see people drink it out of
these big glasses and
smelling it forever Thats
interesting to me that sight
of them doing that But I
dont want them to talk to me
about it you know what I
mean I want to figure it out
based on what Ive seen from
other people and what I
personally get from it

She opens the bottle and pours them both some

PATRICIA
So this is what Ive got So
far To say about this Most
cognac is French Its very
volatile Like gasoline or
model airplane glue And when
you taste it in my opinion
it tastes like gasoline or
model airplane glue Thats
because its for smelling
really And I figure thats
because the French
physically tend to have big
noses They get the pleasure
of the cognac through the
nose
(MORE)

JOE VERSUS THE VOLCANO - Rev 51689 67

PATRICIA (CONTD)

They toast

They drink a

EXT THE TWE

We see it bobbing gently on the sea

coming out
and small h

EXT DINING

You could really just smell it
and pour it down the sink

But this isnt French cognac

This is Italian cognac Its

probably generally considered

inferior But the news is it
tastes good Maybe it doesnt
smell as good -- it smells

okay - but it tastes good
And when I came to that fork
in the road between the nose
and the tongue I chose the
tongue So heres to the
tongue

JOE
To the tongue
little

JOE

Its good Dont the Italians
have big noses too

PATRICIA
Yeah And that really messes
up my theory

EDLE DEE - NIGHT (HOUR AND A HALF LATER)

Many stars are

some waxing quite bright A half moon pale

angs in the western sky

TABLE ABOARD BOAT - NIGHT

Joe and Patricia have been talking and sipping cognac for

an hour and

job in a shut up room with
pumped in air no sunshine

amazement

Joe with three trunks tied together He is easing
Patricias unconscious form on to the three ganged-
together trunks Having accomplished this he slides the
fourth trunk into position with the other three and
begins to secure it with the remaining rope The four
trunks together make up a raft of ten feet square Joe
crawls onto the raft totally exhausted reaches out a
hand to the still form of Patricia and passes out The

The little raft in bright fresh sunlight Joe stirs and
wakes He tries to wake Patricia but to no avail He
looks in all directions Nothing but blue horizon After
a moments thought he opens one of the trunks But its

the wrong one He secures it and opens another He takes
out a violin case and opens it its a bar masquerading
as a violin case the one he bought at Hammacher
Schlemmer It contains two bottles of Moet champagne
two champagne glasses and two bottles of Pellegrino
water Joe takes out one of the bottles of water and
closes the case Then he gets his little world-band
radio out of the trunk and sets it down He opens the
Pellegrino water and starts to drink But then he
thinks He looks at Patricia Her lips are a little
parched He looks up at the sun

presses the cap to Patricias lips He repeats the
process and then satisfied screws the cap on the bottle
again and puts it away in the case Then he puts the
case back in the trunk and fastens the lid He turns ON

element of Western dress about their person The Chief
has a sad rich voice a voice full of memory and

aisle The natives start the same call and response they
had going when Joes raft was first sighted Emo calls
and the natives respond This call and response
continues through all the following Joe walks off down
the aisle The Chief follows him Before Patricia can
follow the Chief the crowd closes in following Joe up
the mountain Patricia tries to reach Joe

carries a heavy lit torch that he swings from side to
side with a ritual motion With each swing he lights
another permanent tiki sconce along the paths upward
progress He is followed by Joe dapper and alone Joe
in turn is followed by the Chief who walks with a ritual
movement not unlike the bent-kneed gait of a Sumo
wrestler leaning first on one leg then on the other He
is assisted in this gyration by two lackeys one to his
left one to his right who catch him as he leans to his
most extreme angle and gently shoves him back the other
way Behind the Chief comes the general native
population all of whom carry torches

platform on which Joe and Patricia stand will give way
and fall into the volcano

some stuff to me - if you make
it back home If I come back

remains to be seen But what
I think and I say this to you
from the bottom of my heart
sir I dont fear you at all
I dont fear any man Because
every day is a gift and Im
just glad as hell it looks
like I may have a few And
beyond that to be scared or
glad of anything beyond that

fool

fear a laugh of pure joy Patricia goes below Only
