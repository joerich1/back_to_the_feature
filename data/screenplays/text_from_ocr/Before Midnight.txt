EXT AIRPORT - AFTERNOON

We follow Jesse back through the airport as he finds his way
to the parking lot revealing Celine standing outside of
the car talking on the phone

CELINE
(speaking french)
Oui oui
(continues in french)
Okay

As Jesse and Celine settle inside the car the camera pans
over toward two 6-year-old girls who are asleep in the back
seat Thats right twins NINA and ELLA They start driving
away from the airport

INT CAR - AFTERNOON

As they hit the highway Celine lowers her volume as she
wraps up her conversation
CELINE
(into phone)
Okay Bon Tr√©s bien Merci
Oui oui Lucia Auvoir
(hangs up speaks
french)

JESSE
Whats going on

CELINE
They voted against it

JESSE
What the wind turbines

CELINE
Six months dealing with those people
they were all for it Everyone agreed
it was great for the region

JESSE
Oh So what happened

CELINE
-And now theyve decided that they
dont like the way it looks on that
hill Its ruining their view

JESSE
No no I thought it was a done deal
CELINE
It was It practically was--
JESSE
Well can--
CELINE

Thats whats so infuriating

JESSE
Can they do that

CELINE
Yes of course Theyve done it
Thats it Its over fini

JESSE

CELINE
No no its just so frustrating I
cant take it anymore

(MORE )
CELINE (CONTD)
(beat )
Im gonna take that job with Remy

JESSE
No No you dont want to work for
him

CELINE
Why not

JESSE
For the government

CELINE
Well I think this government is
different We need laws Thats
the only way anything is going to
happen

JESSE
Its not the only way You guys
have been getting a lot of good work
done

CELINE
Well Ive been thinking about it
This is the way to go

JESSE
Okay Well then let me remind you
that you do not like that guy The
whole time you worked for him before
you complained about him constantly

CELINE
Yeah yeah yeah He can be an
asshole but he gets things done
Thats how Im gonna be from now on--

JESSE
Okay

CELINE
A real bitch okay Thats it

JESSE
Okay Well every time I look at
that guy all I see is ambition I
mean Im sorry I just dont trust
him The only reason hes going
from non-profit to government is to
have people kiss his ass
CELINE
I dont care about him okay

JESSE
All right and I think youre gonna
be miserable all right Just with
all that politicking and compromising--

CELINE
Whatever Ive made my decision
Im tired of being the do-gooder
that rolls a boulder up a hill and
watches it roll down again

JESSE
Isnt he the guy that used to throw
his pens at his assistant and stuff

CELINE
Okay I should have taken this job a
year ago You know and I was scared
because of the amount of work but I
think its the best opportunity ever
and its more money and Im doing
it

JESSE
Okay Are you sure

CELINE
No Im not sure of anything okay

JESSE
All right all right--

CELINE
I mean you know whats gonna happen
to everyone if I leave Like
Francoise and I mean they count on
me What do you think Should I
take it or not should Should I

JESSE
Ah no no no I dont have an
opinion I just dont want to see
you rush into a decision because of
this wind turbine crap

CELINE
No Its not just that okay Its
been stirring in me all summer

JESSE
Well I know it has I know

CELINE
And I should do it And Im doing
it

JESSE
All right then just - then do it

CELINE
Im doing it all right Oh god
I wish things were simpler I mean
if I leave I get fucked if I stay I
get fucked

JESSE
(laughs )
Theres always a catch

CELINE
Yeah the world is fucked

JESSE
Yeah baby

CELINE
Oh god We finally have a vacation
and the girls are sick for the first
two weeks

Or the perfect son who lives a million
miles away

CELINE
Or the love of your life cant clean
up after himself or learn how to
shave

JESSE
Whos that Youre not youre not
talking about Captain Clean-up over
here are you You dont mean--

CELINE
Captain Clean-up The one thats
been missing in action all these
years

JESSE
What did you expect at this point in
your life missy

Celine turns back to look at the twins
CELINE
God Oh look at them theyre so
cute They look like conjoined twins
Oh my god I gotta take a picture

She takes out her cell phone and takes a picture
reaches back for something he cant quite find

JESSE
Hey did uh did Ella finish that
apple

CELINE

Youre going to take food out of
your childs mouth

JESSE
Yeah

Jesse

Celine reaches back and grabs a half-eaten apple off the

seat

CELINE
Okay Well Its all brown

JESSE
Oh theres a spot here

He takes a bite from the green part of the apple
now filming him with the camera

CELINE
Ella - this is evidence of your father
stealing food from you If you become
bulimic or anorexic it is not my
fault Dont blame it all on your
mother okay

JESSE
Ella this is a family apple Im
teaching you the value of sharing
I love you honey

CELINE
Ohh so sweet You girls will
remember this vacation very
differently than we will

JESSE
Thats for sure I see that with my
mom She remembers my childhood
entirely differently than I do Can
you please stop filming me

Celine puts the phone away

Celine is
CELINE
God I love your mom Youre always
so hard on her

JESSE
Its because you missed the fucked
up years Youre just getting the
good era

CELINE
The fucked up years That reminds
me talking about fucked up did I
ever tell you the story of my little
Cleopatra kitty No Okay I think
you would remember if I did When I
was a little girl I had this cat
named Cleopatra and every spring she
would jump the fence and get pregnant
and always end up with a litter of
exactly two kittens

JESSE
Two kitties

CELINE
Two kitties Every time every year
two cats I mean it was just
amazing Then one day I was around
30 and I was having lunch with my
Dad I was remembering mentioning
little Cleopatra and he was like -
‚Äòthe hardest thing I ever had to do
was to kill those cute little kittens-
and I was like WHAT It turns out--
listen to this--there were sometimes
up to 7 kittens in that litter--

JESSE
Oh no
CELINE
But he would take five of them--
JESSE
Oh no
CELINE

--Put them into a plastic bag with a
bunch of ether

JESSE
(laughs )
Thats terrible

CELINE
He had forgotten the lie he and my
mom had told me as a kid

JESSE
How did he decide which ones he wanted
to kill

CELINE

Well I actually asked him that
Did you take the fluffiest cutest
He just started to cry

JESSE
Oh

CELINE
Poor Daddy

INT KITCHEN - AFTERNOON

Natalia Ariadni and Celine are sitting at a table in the
kitchen chopping vegetables

CELINE
I mean I love it here This place
is amazing These tomatoes are so
amazing I can I can smell them
They smell so good

ARIADNI
Yeah Patrick is very proud of them

CELINE
I know its stupid but when we were
about to leave Paris I was a little
nervous to come here And now that
were about to leave I dont want
to go

NATALIA
Why were you nervous

ARIADNI
Yeah why was that

CELINE
I dont know This place is so full
of thousands of years of myth and
tragedy and I thought something tragic
was going to happen

NATALIA
What you thought the Minotaur was
going to eat your children or
something

CELINE
Yes Exactly

All three women laugh
EXT PATIO - AFTERNOON
Back with the guys

JESSE
All right well the whole time Ive
been here Ive been working on this
idea about a group of different people
with all these brain abnormalities
So the book would be like a day in
their life from all their unique
points of view right Like theres
this older lady who has a condition
that makes you feel like youre ina
perpetual state of d√©ja vu Every
single experience she has she feels
like shes had it before I mean
she can be sitting here with us
talking seemingly functional right
And in her head shes thinking
Didnt he already say that I mean
werent we here yesterday having
this exact same conversation

STEFANOS

So just like Deja Vu
JESSE

Yeah except all the time
STEFANOS

Ah
JESSE

Right thats the thing right
Everything she takes in Breakfast

a newspaper a movie Shes convinced
shes encountered it already

STEFANOS
So thats a real condition

JESSE
Yeah Its called persistent deja
Its real but I cant pronounce it

The men chuckle

JESSE
Then theres these two other
characters with facial recognition
extremes Like theres this one guy
and he cant recognize his wife of
twenty years He looks at himself
in the mirror and he feels this
disconnect with that man hes looking
at Then the other character is the
opposite middle-aged housewife with
a categorical exacting memory of
every face shes ever seen so she
lives in a big city but to her its
a small town Like a taxi drives
past and she thinks Oh thats the
driver who dropped me off at Place
de Vosges three Christmases ago
And some old lady walking on the
street she thinks Oh she sat two
seats down from me on the Metro last
year So everyone she meetsto
her feels intimate and connected

STEFANOS
Well Im just like the first guy
Like I feel connected to nothing
most of the time man

We see Patricks grandson Achilles and girlfriend Anna
come walking by just from the beach Anna slaps his butt
playfully before heading indoors while Achilles joins the

guys

JESSE
Oh Achilles Anna Hey you guys

PATRICK
Hey look at this kid Hes having
the best summer of us all

ACHILLES
Hello Pappou

STEFANOS
So you were saying theres three
characters right
All laugh

JESSE
No its not just three characters
its a whole group of people Its
like Im working on a chapter right
now about a young Greek man named
Achilles

ACHILLES
Me

JESSE
Well hes named after you And
this guy is caught in a loop where
all he sees is the transient nature
of everything right Like he looks
out to sea and thinks of the day
its gonna be dry and littered with
fossils

STEFANOS
Well I dunno It sounds a little
pretentious to me

JESSE
Ah no-no-no It wont be
pretentious I promise No its
gonna be funny Really funny He
picks up a book and he immediately
wonders Whos gonna be the last
person to read this

STEFANOS
And that‚Äôs funny

ACHILLES
Sometimes I kind of think like that

STEFANOS
Well okay so he doesnt get excited
about tits cars booze nothing
He just thinks about death

JESSE
Well not so much death right
Its just like transformation you
know Like hes seeing too far into
the future

STEFANOS
Okay

PATRICK
I like this idea for a novel But
you should add a character of an old
man like me - a poor sap who cant
remember what he had for breakfast
but he can still hear the song that
was playing when Sheila Campbell
danced topless on the bar at Jurys
when he was 14 years old

JESSE
Thatll work

STEFANOS
Okay You have these people lost in
time right ok But whats the
connection Are they going to have
sex Dont you need something like
that

JESSE

Its not time that theyre lost in
right Its like perception Thats
the deal No Im thinking of setting
the whole novel at a movie Like
every character in some way comes in
contact with the film On the
Waterfront

(to Achilles)
Have you seen On the Waterfront

Hes not sure until Stefanos tells him the Greek title

ACHILLES
Oh with Brando

JESSE
Yeah

ACHILLES
Uh-huh

JESSE

Yeah yeah Okay well the first
chapter of the book is opening
weekend Times Square 1954 That
old lady with perpetual deja vu
walks into the matinee screening
right Except the whole time shes
thinking havent I already seen
this

STEFANOS
Yeah

JESSE
Right And then another chapter is
a 1979 Paris film studies class
Then we have a Kazan retrospective
in Munich 1993

STEFANOS
Well man that is time How is
that not time

JESSE
Yeah its time but its more
perception You dont like it

STEFANOS
I think its going to be too long

They laugh
PATRICK
Well I like it Dont listen to
him - he makes bicycles Send it to
me in galleys

JESSE
Will do

EXT PATRICKS HOUSE - AFTERNOON

property

INT KITCHEN - AFTERNOON

Ariadni Stefanos and Celine are in the kitchen preparing

the meal

CELINE
In France we stuff the tomatoes with
tomatoes and the peppers with peppers

ARIADNI
Oh really Because we use the same
stuffing for both because of the
way it reacts differently in terms
of taste Oh and Celine make sure
you dont stuff them too much because
of the way it overflows in the oven
later and gets kind of nasty

CELINE
Okay okay yeah

STEFANOS
Youre doing fine Celine

ARIADNTI
And especially dont listen to
Stefanos here because hes never
made this dish before or any other
dish for that matter

family but for all the ways youve
given back all right So to
Patrick

OTHERS

the airport I thought No way a man
dressed like that could be a man of
letters

GROUP
(Laughing)

PATRICK
But now now I think Ive learned
your secret Weve had many great
writers here over the past decade
but never one who had a partner more
interesting than themselves

GROUP
(Reacting)
Ohh Oh
(Laughing)

CELINE
I keep telling you

PATRICK
And Celine its been so great to
have you and your daughters wonderful
vitality around here and Im so
happy youve been able to meet my
dear friend Natalia whos husband
Elias was like a brother to me

CELINE
(to Patrick)
Im so sorry about the curtains

PATRICK
Dont worry Its nothing

JESSE
I know I shouldnt have thrown
those cherries-

CELINE
No I mean really -

JESSE
It was my fault

PATRICKCELINE
No no Thats sweet of you

ACHILLES

at the table of the grown-ups
JESSE
Welcome to the grownups table Hear

CELINE
(to Anna)
How long have you two been together

ANNA
Since last summer

ACHILLES
We met one year ago in my last few
days here with grandpa before I had
to go back to Athens

ANNA
Yeah we met at my closing night
cast party I was doing Shakespeare
at Epidavros

JESSE
So who did you play

ANNA
I was Perdita in A Winters Tale

STEFANOS
And she was fantastic Remember
Patrick we went to that

PATRICK
Ahhh Perdita When you do dance
I wish you a wave of the sea that
you might ever do nothing but that

GROUP
(Reacting Applauding)
Bravo
STEFANOS

The way he just performed that was
much better than the guy at the play

ACHILLES
Actually people are still talking
about that production

ANNA
Yeah but the after party was even
better Its where we met

ACHILLES
I had an old BSA motorcycle

JESSE
Nice

ACHILLES
Yeah We drove around all night
And then I had to drive her back to
the theater to get her stuff And
it was dawn

ANNA
Ill never forget it Its outdoors
and seats 12000 people but it was
now completely empty

ACHILLES
Yeah And she was sitting way up in
the back row So I went up on stage
and whispered to her

ANNA
Yeah the acoustics there are
incredible I could see his mouth
move and then three seconds later
I could hear his voice in my ear

JESSE
(to Anna quietly)
Whatd he say

Anna just smiles not saying

JESSE (CONTD)
Woah Okay

ARIADNI
(Laughing)
Thats private

ACHILLES
And then she had to fly back to Paris
a couple of days later

CELINE
How did you keep in touch

ACHILLES
We Skyped Pretty much everyday
since then

ANNA
Yeah and when were apart we have a
thing of putting our laptops by the
pillow and falling asleep together

CELINE
Ah thats the new romance
ACHILLES
And when I wake up the screen is
usually frozen and Annas face is
in some funny position like
(Mimes )
STEFANOS
Okay Can I ask you a question
Please
ANNA
Yes
STEFANOS

When you guys Skype do you you
know do you go a little crazy

ARIADNI
God youre being so vulgar

STEFANOS
No Im not being vulgar Im just
being an amateur anthropologist who
is interested in virtual words ona
theoretical level

ARIADNI
So now youre an anthropologist

STEFANOS
Yeah For instance the sex of the
near future okay and Im not making
this up but its gonna be just like
plugging in attaching something to
your genitals - Im sorry - and then
youll be having virtual intercourse
with anyone of your choice You
will be able to program in all your
preferences Youll be able to type
in exactly what you want Marilyn
Monroe to whisper in your ear

GROUP
(Reacting)
Hm

CELINE
Oh I might like that

JESSE
Come on

ACHILLES
I mean why not I mean more and
more of our experiences are going to
take place in the virtual world

ANNA
Yeah And you are a writer how
are you going to feel when a computer
can write a book better than War
and Peace

PATRICK
Itll never happen

ACHILLES
I think its only a question about
WHEN its going to happen grandpa

JESSE
You know I think Im probably gonna
feel about the same way as Kasparov -
you remember how all those chess
players felt when they could no longer
compete with that big-ass computer -

STEFANOS
The Big Blue

JESSE
Right right right Remember at
first nobody thought a computer could
ever beat our best

STEFANOS
Right

JESSE
(Accent )
A machine lacks that ineffable human
instinct

GROUP
(Laughing)

JESSE
And now we cant even compete

CELINE
I saw this documentary where they
were doing an experiment on a lab
rat and he was wired up and he could
push a switch and have an orgasm

GROUP
(Laughs )

CELINE

And so scientists were sort of
laughing at this pathetic little
creature while it ignored its food
and water and didnt do anything
else and eventually it just died
I mean I think thats the future of
humanity You know just

(Demonstrates Rat

Dying)

- And die

GROUP
(Laughing)

PATRICK
Well maybe so but every generation
believes that theyre witnessing the
end of the world but I feel that
Im actually living it

JESSE
Okay All right I have a question
for you Patrick I think a lot of
people are feeling that way You
know that were this kind of pleasure
obsessed porn-addled materialists
ceding our humanity to technology
At the same moment that computers
are becoming sentient right So
what my question is what is this
notion of self to begin with

PATRICK
Its written over the portals to the
Temple of Apollo at Delphi It says
Gnothi seauton which means Know
Thyself

JESSE
Yeah but were kind of 99 automated
already Our personality - or this
thing we think of as ourself right -
its just a tiny fraction of what
the brain is doing right

STEFANOS
Yeah

JESSE
Most of its just automated body
function

CELINE

Okay
JESSE
So then what is it were actually
ceding

CELINE
(Interrupting)
If this notion of self is such a
small percentage of you sweetie

JESSE
Yes

CELINE
How come I always hear so much about
it

GROUP
(Laughs )

STEFANOS
Well its just like my penis I
mean its not that big its a small
part of myself but it needs a lot
of attention

CELINE
His too

ANNA
And how did you two meet

ARIADNI
You dont know

ANNA
What

STEFANOS
Well you have to read Jesses books

CELINE
Yeah especially if you want to know
exactly what its like to have sex
with me read away

STEFANOS
Read away

CELINE
Oh excuse me Stefanos

STEFANOS
No no I mean its well written

44

JESSE
Thank you We met about 18 years
ago We kinda sort of fell in
love a little bit and then we lost
track of each other and a decade
later we ran into each other

CELINE
No no no we didnt run into each
other sweetie-pie

JESSE
We didnt

CELINE
No You wrote a book inspired by
our meeting

JESSE
Yeah yeah

CELINE
And I read about it and went to look
for it

ANNA

Thats pretty romantic

JESSE
It was really romantic

CELINE
Not really Not really He neglects
to mention he was married had a

kid
JESSE
Details details
CELINE
Yeah that part was a disaster
JESSE
It wasnt a disaster It was
inevitable
CELINE

Yeah Okay And the first time we
have sex without a condom twins

JESSE
Yeah one pitch one homerun Boom
Anna nods

CELINE
And Ive been chained to the sink
ever since Im sorry to say that
but -

ANNA
Its not that bad is it The girls
are so beautiful

JESSE
Thank you

CELINE
Theyre cute

GROUP
(Laughs Reacts)

CELINE
Okay no no it has some upsides
Let me tell you right now Anna how
to keep a man

CELINE (CONTD)
Youve gotta let them win at all the
silly little games

JESSE
Oh okay

CELINE
They like When I met Jesse
the first night we were playing
pinball and of course I was
winning

JESSE
Is the foundation to our entire
relationship a lie It is It is

CELINE
And at the last minute I let the
ball go down the middle It builds
their confidence

JESSE
No she cant beat me at one game
not any game

CELINE
If I didnt let him win at every
game we would never have sex
(MORE )

CELINE (CONTD)
I mean Im sorry to say it but
hes actually a closet macho He
dreams of having a bimbo for a wife

GROUP
(Laughs )

CELINE
Dreams

JESSE
Its my greatest aspiration A bimbo

Celine changes her demeanor and voice playing really dumb

CELINE
Okay Well youre very very smart
and
(whispering)
I bet you have a gigantic penis

JESSE
Why am I finding myself so attracted
to this woman

CELINE
Yes he is - calm down
GROUP
(Reacts )
STEFANOS
Wow
CELINE

And thats the funny part of it

The not-so-funny part of the closet
macho okay -- is that today after
we drop Henry off he tells me that
even though I have an offer for an
amazing job he wants me to throw it
all away and move to Chicago

JESSE
Thats not what I said

CELINE
Yes

JESSE

I said I missed him You were
expressing something you felt
conflicted about and I did the same

CELINE

So we can baby sit every other weekend

for his ex-wife I mean hilarious

ARIADNI
Hey hey hey You guys stop it
It must have been so hard saying
goodbye to Hank today right

CELINE
Yeah of course

ARIADNI
I mean hes such an amazing kid

ACHILLES
Tell him I already miss my chess
partner

JESSE
Right away
ARIADNI
When Stefanos and I split up
STEFANOS
Yeah
ARIADNI

Im getting full custody

STEFANOS
Oh Well thats ok for a while
because me and my 20 year old
girlfriend will be a little
preoccupied

GROUP
(Laughs )

ARIADNTI
(laughter )
I love men

STEFANOS
And I love you

ARIADNI
Ok I have a story that my husband
here loves and thats going tell you
everything you need to know about
masculine and feminine Right
Okay ready

JESSESTEFANOS
Yeah

ARIADNI
My mom used to be a nurse So she
was there when people were coming
out of their comas

STEFANOS
Oh that story Yeah

ARIADNI
Listen Listen

STEFANOS
Im listening

ARIADNI
Its an interesting story

STEFANOS
Im listening

ARIADNI
So she was the one to tell them
Hi my names Katerina Youre
coming out of a coma

Stefanos is mouthing words behind her

ANNA
(Laughing)
Im sorry
ARIADNI

Youve been in a really bad
automobile accident Youre going
to be okay

Ariadni puts her hands over Stefanos mouth

ARIADNI (CONTD)
Youre going to be fine and you
know stuff like that She said
that every woman the very first
thing the first reaction she would
have would be to ask about everybody
else How are my kids Hows my
husband Is anyone else hurt
Every man - with no exception - when
they were told this what was the
first thing they did Looked down
at their cock

GROUP
(Laughs )

JESSE
Well you know what Youve gotta
make sure its still there all right
Youve gotta make sure its still
working you have to

ARIADNI
Of course of course

STEFANOS
Alive and kicking

ARIADNI
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

STEFANOS
Yeah all that

ARIADNI
And only eventually eventually
they would come around to asking
about their kids or about someone
else they might have accidentally
killed Stuff like that Important
stuff

CELINE
Doesnt that just say it all Penis
first then the rest of the world

ARIADNI ANNA WOMEN
(Chanting)
Penis penis penis penis penis
penis--

JESSE
Okay whoa whoa whoa If you can
explain it all on strictly gender
terms why do you or why does any
woman waste time getting mad at or
bother trying to change a man

STEFANOS
Exactly Its all biology What is
the problem

CELINE
(to Jesse)
And youre so so good at turning
things around I mean he is a
genius

JESSE
No Im just trying to say its like
being pissed at a frog for being
green

STEFANOS
Exactly

CELINE
Yeah Yeah exactly

ANNA
Hearing all this I wonder if this
idea of a love affair that lasts
forever is still relevant to us I
mean we know that we are going to
break up eventually

ACHILLES
Definitely

JESSE
(to Anna and Achilles)
Okay but are your parents still
together

ANNA
No way

JESSE
No And what about you

ACHILLES
They are But they could be divorced

JESSE
Yeah they could

ACHILLES
(Laughs )
I mean I think that if they had
more money they wouldnt still be
together

ARIADNI
God you guys are so practical I
was born into the wrong generation

ANNA
My grandmothers mother wrote to our
whole family a twenty-six page letter
from her deathbed And she spent
three pages on the costumes she did
for a play and only one paragraph on
her husband

JESSE
Was she an actress too

ANNA
No she was a
(in French)
How do you say seamstress

CELINE
(in English)
A seamstress Seamstress

ANNA
Seamstressand she had all these
wonderful friends About my great
grandfather she mentioned three
events He went to the war we moved
because of his job and he died
Her big advice was not to be too
consumed with romantic love
Friendships and work she said
brought her the most happiness

ARIADNI
I couldnt agree more I mean thats
the thing that fucks us up right
This idea of a soul mate of someone
who will come to complete us and
save us from having to take care of
ourselves With Stefanos I set the
bar extremely low - I know he is not
going to meet any of my needs

GROUP
(Laughing)

STEFANOS
Definitely not

ACHILLES
(to Patrick)
So what about grandma Was she a
soul mate

PATRICK
Well sounds appealing but actually
your grandmother was more rational
than that She took care of herself
and asked me to do the same with
plenty of room to meet in the middle

ANNA
Yeah that sounds ideal

STEFANOS
Yeah it is actually It is

PATRICK
But it must be obvious that my wife
is not here today We were never
one person always two We preferred
it that way

ARIADNI
Thats so beautiful I think my
husband is always trying to almost
colonize me you know

STEFANOS
I colonize you

ARIADNI
Yes but I colonize you too darling

STEFANOS
Well okay then

PATRICK
But at the end of the day its not
the love of one other person that
matters its the love of life

STEFANOS
Thats good to know Patrick because
life I can handle Ariadni on the
other hand We all know that the
Greeks invented tragedy right and
on top of that shes from the region
of Mani which is short for maniac

GROUP
(Laughs )

CELINE
Ask about the hotel

JESSE
Hey you guys if we cant make that
hotel room tonight could you get a
refund or use it yourselves or -

STEFANOS
No no we dont get a refund

ARIADNI
Are you trying to get out of it
Because youre going

STEFANOS
You gotta go

CELINE
No its such a great gift youve
given us but Im so stressed getting
all the packing ready the girls and -

ARIADNI
No no no ‚Äî-

STEFANOS
We made a deal guys you watched
our kids Youre gonna love it

ARIADNI
Were going to watch yours

STEFANOS
Its really really good

ARIADNI
Its a fantastic fantastic walk to
the hotel and you wont regret it
And well be very offended if you
dont go

STEFANOS
It is

CELINE
Okay Thank you

ARIADNI
Youre going

NATALIA
Well when I think of Elias what I
miss the most about him is the way
he used to lie down next to me at
night Sometimes his arm would
stretch along my chest I couldnt
move I even held my breath but I
felt safe complete I miss the
way he was whistling walking down
the street Every time I do
something I think of what he would
say Well its cold today wear a
scarf But lately Ive been
forgetting little things Hes sort
of fading and Im starting to forget
him and its like losing him again

(MORE )

NATALIA (CONTD)
Sometimes I make myself remember
every detail of his face - the exact
color of his eyes his lips his
teeth the texture of his skin his
hair - that was all gone by the time
he went And sometimes not always
but sometimes I can actually see
him It is as if a cloud moves away
and there he is I could almost
touch him but then the real world
rushes in and he vanishes again
For a while I did this every morning
when the sun was not too bright
outside because the sun somehow makes
him vanish He appears and he
disappears like a sunrise or sunset
anything so ephemeral Just like
our life - we appear and we disappear
and we are so important to some
but we are just passing through

JESSE
(Toasting)
To passing through

EXT WALK - EVENING

Celine and Jesse are walking through a very old area in mid-
conversation

JESSE
- And eventually he catches his
face in the windows reflection
And he realizes hes no longer a
nine-year-old boy right Hes
suddenly old hes got a beard his
eyes are watery and hes still -

CELINE
Oh this one seems sad At first I
thought you were going to tell me
the story about the guy that has an
imaginary friend

JESSE
Which one

CELINE
And when hes in his fifties the
imaginary friend shows up again
right

JESSE
With the hummingbird
CELINE
Yes thats the one
JESE
Yeah Oh you like that one
CELINE
Its funny
JESSE
Oh
CELINE

Remember that letter that you let me
read that you wrote when you were
twenty to yourself at forty

JESSE
Yeah I remember the first sentence
Dear Forty-Year-Old Jesse I hope
youre not divorced

CELINE
No I didnt even remember that part
I meant all the other things in that
letteryou were the same guy

JESSE
Yeah

CELINE
I mean we always think were
evolving but maybe we cant change
that much

JESSE
You know how I think Ive changed
the most

CELINE
How

JESSE
When I was younger I just wanted
time to speed up You know

CELINE
Why

JESSE
Well So I could be on my own So
I could be free from my parents and
school and all that shit You know
(MORE )

JESSE (CONTD)
I just wanted to close my eyes and
wake up and be an adult And then I
kind of feel like that all happened
and I just want everything to slow
down

CELINE
Hm its strange - Ive always had
this feeling no matter where I am
in my life that its either a memory
or a dream

JESSE
I know youve always thought that
And me too its like is this really
my life Like is it happening right

now

CELINE
It is

JESSE
I know

Celine and Jesse laugh

JESSE (CONTD)
Every year I just seem to get a little
bit more humbled and more overwhelmed
about all the things Im never going
to know or understand

CELINE
Thats what I keep telling you You
know nothing

JESSE
I know I know Im coming around

Celine and Jesse laugh

CELINE
But not knowing is not so bad I
mean the point is to be looking
searching To stay hungry right

JESSE
I know its true I just wish it
was a little easier

CELINE
How do you mean
JESSE
Well just to maintain a certain
level of passion you know I mean
it used to come so naturally I
remember when I was younger me and
all my writer friends we just felt
like we were doing something
important you know Like this was
our time

CELINE
But you were all a bunch of arrogant
little pricks right

JESSE
No we -

CELINE
Sounds like
(Laugh)

JESSE
All right maybe I dont know it
just grew out of all this energy you
know this creativity or whatever
ambitions people had You know I
think you gotta be a little deluded
to stay motivated

CELINE
Young men have this thing about
comparing themselves all the time
They have all these signposts they
judge themselves by You used to do
that all the time

JESSE
Do what What do you mean

CELINE
With like Rimbaud read this by
seventeen F Scott Fitzgerald did
this by thirty

JESSE
And Balzac wrote a book before
breakfast every day so what the
hell am I doing

CELINE
Yeah But women dont think that
way as much

JESSE
You dont think so

CELINE
No We have much less to compare
ourselves to maybe Most women who
achieve anything in life the first
time you hear about them theyre in
their 50s because it was so hard
for them to get any recognition before
then They struggle for 30 years or
they raise kids and were stranded at
home before they could finally do
what they want Actually you know
what Its kind of freeing We
dont have to spend our lives
comparing ourselves to Martin Luther
King Gandhi Tolstoy

JESSE
(Laughing)
Well what about Joan of Arc right
I mean she was a teenager and she
saved France So

CELINE

Who wants to be Joan of Arc okay
JESSE

No
CELINE

Forget France She was burned at
the stake and a virgin Okay
Nothing I aspire to What a great
achievement

JESSE
(Laughing)
Okay All right all right all
right Whatever

CELINE
(Laughs )
Oh god

JESSE
What

CELINE
No nothing

JESSE
What

CELINE
Its just so weird
JESSE
What do you mean

CELINE
Oh just this Us Walking having
a conversation

JESSE
Oh I know

CELINE
About something else than
scheduling food work

JESSE
Yeah I mean how longs it been
since we just wandered around
bullshitting

CELINE
Do you hear what I hear
JESSE

CELINE

(a beat)
Oh Look at this Wow This place
sort of reminds me of this film I
saw when I was a teenager It was a
black and white film from the 50s
I remember a couple walking through
the ruins of Pompeii looking at
bodies that had been lying there for
centuries I remember the bodies
caught in their sleep still lovingly
holding each other I dont know
why sometimes I have this image in
my mind when you know were asleep
and you hold me

JESSE
What of being buried alive under
molten ash thats what youre
thinking about

CELINE
Yeah
(Laughing)

JESSE
Thats not very fun

CELINE
(Laughing)
Well I dont know its not
horrible They had some bodies with
little kids sleeping between them

JESSE
Oh thats nice

CELINE
Yeah I guess I was young and a bit
morbid - I mean at that age you
romanticize the idea of dying with
the person you love

JESSE
Well you wanna die with me

CELINE
Maybe if it were you know our
first night together then a long
time ago But now no Id like to
live

JESSE
Well I just wanted you to say
something romantic and you blew it
Putain de merde

Hello Hello

CELINE
Oh wow

INT CHAPEL - AFTERNOON

JESSE
Its a shrine to Saint Odilia a
patron saint to eyesight People
come from all over they leave little
dedications to the blind to help
restore sight

CELINE
Im sure it works

He is looking at the old faded paintings on the walls

JESSE
Maybe These paintings here they
make me think of those Japanese monks
you know with their deal on
impermanence They like to paint
with water on rock on a hot day so
by the time theyre done its already
evaporated

Celine notices all the icons have been subtly defaced

CELINE
All the eyes are scratched out Is
that about the blindness

JESSE
No I thought that too but the
caretaker guy he told me that the
Turks did that during the Occupation

CELINE
Thats it Im never eating Turkish
food again

JESSE
Oh okay Well thatll send a shiver
through the international community

CELINE
Okay fine then Ill never suck
another Turkish cock

JESSE
(Laughs )
Now THATs gonna have a global impact

CELINE
Oh thats terrible No I forgot
youre a closet Christian Is it
really bad to make blow-job jokes in
a church

Jesse just shrugs

JESSE
Kind of is okay But weve done
worse
CELINE
(a beat)

The girls asked me again what our
wedding was like

JESSE
Yeah Whatd you say

of mine George from New York

JESSE

before
JESSE

CELINE

He was this friend of mine that
when he found out he had leukemia
and he was probably going to die he
confessed to me that the first thing
that came to his mind was relief
JESSE
Relief But why

CELINE
Well before he found out he had
nine months to live he was always so
worried about money and now his
thought was great I have more
than enough money to live for the
next nine months Ive made it

JESSE
(Laughing)
Oh okay
CELINE

And then he was finally able to enjoy
everything about life even like
being stuck in traffic He would
just enjoy looking at people
staring at their faces Just little
things

JESSE
And then what happened

CELINE
What do you mean

JESSE
Well like is he still alive

CELINE
What What did I say
JESSE
Good luck with your mom

(Laughs )
I mean come on ‚Äî-

CELINE
I didnt mean anything by it

JESSE
I know but its not good It just
reminds him of the whole thing I
just wish you wouldnt do that

CELINE

Oh like you think he forgets
JESSE

No
CELINE

Thats so American to just sweep it
under the carpet and act as if it
didnt happen

JESSE
Why put it into his head You know
What if he doesnt want to be thinking
about that right now Hes too
stressed

CELINE
It means nothing

JESSE
It means something It does

CELINE
Alright I even made a joke the other
day that his mom and I should try to
settle it in one big mud wrestling
contest

JESSE
Mud wrestling You said that
CELINE
And he laughed He might have more
of a sense of humor than you do
Come on

JESSE
We just talked about that When you
say bad things about his mom what
he hears is bad things about himself

CELINE
Well I didnt say anything bad about
his mom I made a joke its as
much on me as it is on her

JESSE
Well youre right I know I know
I know Just why conjure it up at
all you know

Jesse gets up out of bed and goes across the room goes to
Celines purse and turns off her phone

CELINE
I think hes old enough now I mean
he knows how bad it is between his
mother and I

JESSE
His mom and me

CELINE
And I didnt do anything its all
coming from her towards me Okay
she hates me yes I fucked her
husband a long time ago Or should
I say he fucked me

JESSE
Yeah right

CELINE
Making a joke about the fact that
his mom and I dont love each other
is not the issue Thats not going
to traumatize him That already
happened alright and now youre
trying to transfer your guilt and
blame me

JESSE
No Im not

CELINE
You know on the contrary if he can
make a joke about it maybe hell be
able to live with it better Thats
what I think

JESSE
Okay Youre right As always
Lets just not talk about it okay

CELINE
Its nobodys fault if his mom is a
drunk and abusive psychologically

JESSE
Dont say that

CELINE
I mean it makes me sick that he has
to be with her but I guess judges
assume that women have the mother
instinct She has the mother instinct
of Medea

Jesse goes to the bathroom and washes off his face

JESSE
Medea huh
CELINE
Yeah after all it is a Greek myth
JESSE
Its actually a play by Euripides
but -
CELINE

A woman killing her kids to punish
her ex-husband Thats basically
what shes doing shes hurting him
to get to you

JESSE
No shes making my life hell through
him thats what shes doing You
know sometimes you say things that
just go too far

CELINE
Okay stop blaming me for everything
that is wrong in this whole thing
with your wife okay

JESSE
Ex-wife Ex-wife for a long time

CELINE
Okay you should have dealt with it
a little better back then She
wouldnt have hated us so much

JESSE
Okay--I screwed up And I love this
little re-write you do everything
that isnt perfect in our life gets
laid at my feet

CELINE
And now youre putting this shit on
me about Henry

JESSE
What shit Whatre you talking about

Jesse takes off his pants and returns to the bed Celine
immediately begins putting on her top and gets up

CELINE
Let me tell you what Im talking
about the moving to Chicago and
giving up of my life Now that you
mention that Henry needs you how do
you think that makes me feel Im
miserable Alright How can I take
that job now Tell me

JESSE
Okay

CELINE
Tell me Ill feel too guilty No-
no-no-no-no

JESSE
Look look Thats a choice youre
making to look at it like that
alright

CELINE
It is in the nature of women to be
the nurturah

JESSE
The what

CELINE
Nur-tchur-yer

JESSE
The nurturer
CELINE
Okay I cant even say that fucking
word I just naturally feel bad
about everything And you give me
that look like its my fault

JESSE
What look

CELINE
That look the I-forgot-to-put-in-
the-bag-the-science-project-look I
know you blame me

JESSE
I didnt say anything

CELINE
No You didnt say anything You
didnt have to Yeah yeah its
always my fault

JESSE
Yeah right

Celine walks across the room sits on the couch and turns
on her phone again

CELINE
I read on the fridge at work - you
know those magnet words that people
make sentences with Someone had
put together Women explore for
eternity in the vast garden of
sacrifice

JESSE
(Laughs )
Wow Thats a sure sign from God

CELINE
Yeah That line is so damn true and
its been for ten thousand years
But thats enough Okay I dont
want to be one of these women Like
marriage is important to gays or
contraception to women rights - its
the same with giving up my hopes
with the millions of women that have
had to give up their hopes I am
not going to do it This is bigger
than me This means more than me

Jesse bursts into applause
JESSE
Wow Bravo The Nobel committee is
taking note Im just - hold ona
second Im gonna alert Sweden okay
I mean it must be a full-time job
carrying that much feminine
oppression

CELINE
It is

JESSE
You suffered so much growing up in
middle-class Paris I mean the
agony in the trenches of the Sorbonne
in the post-feminist era I cant
imagine

CELINE
Youre an asshole You know what
sweetie when are we moving to
Chicago I want to make sure we are
able to find a nice house and I can
sew the drapes and pick matching bed
covers

JESSE
So this is how you now want to be
spending this evening I mean this
is what you wanna do tonight

CELINE
Well you started it

JESSE

No You are the one who will not
shut up about it But if you want
to talk about it I mean really
talk about it I would prefer to
have an unemotional rational
conversation I mean do you think
we can do that Would that be
possible

CELINE
Here we go Unemotional rational
You always play the part of the one
and only rational one and Im the
irrational hysterical hormone-crazy
one because I have emotions Yeah
you sit back and you speak from your
big perspective which means everything
you say is level-headed and true

JESSE
I dont always do anything

CELINE
The world is fucked by unemotional
rational men deciding shit alright
Politicians going to war for no
reason corporate heads deciding to
wreck the environment Cheney
Rumsfeld - very rational men

JESSE
Cheney and Rumsfeld Yeah okay

CELINE
The final solution Very rational
thinking behind it

JESSE
(Laughs )

Oh okay so were there now Us
versus the final solution Okay
Lets do it alright Let me ask
you this alright Do you think
Henrys life would be helped by a
more consistent presence by you and
me

CELINE
Here we go

Jesse gets up from the bed puts his pants back on and joins
Celine on the couch

JESSE
No You wont drop it so lets
talk about it Alright Let me
just ask you one question Do you
think Hanks life would be better
served by a more consistent presence
from you and me

CELINE
Yes I think itd be better if he
lived with us

JESSE
Okay

CELINE
- And I think his mom is a fucking
alcoholic hateful cunt that used
the time that we were in Paris and I
was giving birth and almost dying to
(MORE )

CELINE (CONTD)
legally move Henry out of New York
Fuck her

JESSE
Okay I agree with you
Unfortunately we cannot go get him
out of America but we could if we
wanted to go to him Now I know
it would be a big move but what do
you think I mean is there any way
you could be happy in the US Is
that just out of the realm of
possibility That you could find a
comparable job there

CELINE

Comparable job Are you kidding
JESSE

No
CELINE

Why am I the one that always has to
make the compromises

JESSE
Oh Jesus Christ Dont be so
dramatic okay

CELINE
Well moving to Chicago is pretty
fucking dramatic to me

JESSE
Im not saying we should move I
just want to talk about it Can you
be my friend for like two seconds so
we can talk

CELINE
Okay two seconds

JESSE
Alright Do you remember that time
that you were like 35 minutes late
to pick the girls up from school and
you were so stressed out because you
knew they were out there in the
playground wondering what the hell
had happened to you Okay that is
the way I feel all the time you
know like I fucked up I mean I
left him behind and I just wanna go
get him
CELINE
You always get like this when you
drop him off Youre sad so you
start a fight Hes fine Hes a
great kid Okay But the truth is
he doesnt need you the way he used
to You missed the opportunity to
be with him everyday of his childhood
you just did And you can cry about
it but hes growing up Youre a
great father in other ways You got
divorced like millions of other
people Was it ideal No Listen
if in one month you still want me
to quit my job and give up everything
I have ben working towards all these
years just ask me But right now I
feel the same way I always have I
would move back to the US if that
diseased ex-wife of yours would give
us joint custody But every other
weekend amounts to shit Jesse thats
less than thirty days a semester and
I dont think its worth it for us
to change our entire lives over that
kind of time

JESSE
I know youre right

CELINE
Right right See Im being the
rational one

JESSE
Oh its just such a shitty position
you know I mean Hank didnt do
anything but hes the one getting
kicked in the teeth

CELINE
We all get dragged through our
parents lives If it wasnt me
your marriage would have ended over
something else and you know that

JESSE
Absolutely

CELINE
Or even worse he would have been
raised by two miserable parents

94

JESSE
I know I just really fucked that
up

CELINE

You mean you fucked up by moving to
Paris to be with me

JESSE
No Thats not what I meant
CELINE
I knew that was going to cost too
much
JESSE
Thats not what I meant at all
CELINE
I told you not to do it
JESSE
Stop it
CELINE

I moved to New York with you for two
years and gave up everything but I
needed to be home to give birth to

the twins because it was a complicated
birth and I wanted to be with my
mother And you wanted it too

JESSE
Yes Okay

CELINE
Okay Thats the one thing I asked
from you the one thing And now
youre going to blame me forever

JESSE
Stop it will you Stop it If you
dont want to move back to the States
we wont End of story Im just
trying to find a way where I can be
more of a consistent presence in his
life and ideally Id like to do
that as a family

CELINE
‚ÄòAs a family Or what

JESSE
What the fuck does that mean
Silence

CELINE
I feel a passive aggressive threat
in everything you say Either do
this or I will resent you for the
rest of our lives

CELINE (CONTD)
No Am I Right You know what
Im sensing something I think the
problem is that you dont want me to
have a more substantial job On
some level you feel threatened by
my achieving anything that could
diminish your status in our
relationship

JESSE
My status in our relationship I
teach two courses a semester at the
fucking American school Ok wow
thats really some status

CELINE
Now I dont think its any coincidence
that you feel that way at the same
time that I have a truly exciting
job opportunity

JESSE
This whole train of thought is
complete horse shit and you know it

CELINE
I have a question for you If we
didnt have the girls all our crap
Would we even still be together

JESSE
What I mean you are the fucking
mayor of crazy town do you know
that You are

CELINE
You know what I think I think you
need to move to Chicago I think
Henry needs you and I think I need
to stay in Paris with the girls and
take this job

JESSE
Why are you doing this huh That
is a ridiculous idea

(MORE )

JESSE (CONTD)
Like Im gonna lose you and the girls
No Why do you make everything so
difficult

CELINE
Jesse youre unhappy with me Youre
blaming me for taking you away from
your son

JESSE
That is a completely irrational
response to something I am just trying
to feel my way through

CELINE
Listen Jesse Weve just spent the
last six weeks here and its been
great Youve been able to write
everyday and the weathers been nice
But I didnt want to come to Greece
originally

JESSE
I know

CELINE
All right There could be a
revolution any second

JESSE
Dont

CELINE
People eat a lot of feta and olive
oil they act all happy but they
actually talk about how angry they
are and it confuses me and I dont
know whats going to happen in the
next few weeks

JESSE
Whoa whoa whoa Let me tell you
whats going to happen alright The
same thing that always happens
Nothing

CELINE
Alright You know what I have had
absolutely zero time for myself I
have ten thousand emails I have to
answer that I didnt answer

JESSE
And you think I dont
CELINE
I spend all day making dinner wiping
both you and your sons pee off the
toilet seat while you talk to your
fellow novelists Blah blah blah
youre a genius blah blah blah
no youre a genius And the second
we say goodbye to Henry you suggest
that maybe I should give up my dream
job because you feel bad

JESSE
Oh Okay now its your dream job
This afternoon you werent even sure
you wanted it but now its your dream
job Do you ever listen to yourself

CELINE
Yes it is my dream job Just because
I have doubts doesnt mean I dont
want it

JESSE
Okay

CELINE
All right But what do you care
Every day you go on your two hour
contemplative walk under the olive
trees Socrates you should get a
robe

JESSE
Its an hour

CELINE
No by the time you leave and by
the time youre actually with us
again two hours You know I could
never do that Youre very good at
taking care of yourself I take
care of myself AND everything else
Were going somewhere you pack your
bag I pack EVERYTHING else

JESSE
You would never let me pack the girls
shit Never

CELINE
Because there would be no shoes and
plenty of dirty underwear

JESSE
So says you

CELINE
Im happy you have time to contemplate
the universe and have existential
problems because I dont - I barely
have time to think I work I baby-
sit I work I baby-sit

Jesse wanders off into the bathroom to take a pee

JESSE
Could you hold on a second I just
have to tune up the string section

CELINE
You know what The only time I get
to think now is when I take a shit
at the office Im starting to
associate thoughts with the smell of
shit

JESSE
Well that is a good line - I want
to use that in a book someday

CELINE
Im sure you will - and thatll be
the best line in the book

She walks over and talks to him directly while hes in the
bathroom

CELINE (CONTD)
And by the way you may never EVER
use me or anything I say or do in
one of your fucking books again
And that goes for the girls too

Jesse comes back out

JESSE
Well A) You shouldnt have hooked
up with a writer B) You werent
in the last book or the one Im
writing now C) Im gonna write
about whatever the fuck I want

CELINE
As always OUR life works for YOU

JESSE
No no no Dont give me this put
upon housewife bullshit Okay this
is not the 50s

(MORE )

JESSE (CONTD)
Im sorry to ruin your perfect little
narrative of oppression with the
truth but I am the one whos at home
everyday dealing with the bullshit
cause youre at work until 630

CELINE
6 oclock

JESSE
You take the girls to school and I
pick them up Thats fair thats
our deal We live in Paris France
for chrissakes

CELINE
Yeah and you remind me of it every
single day

JESSE

I have orbited my entire life around
you and you know it So I am sorry
if this Summers vacation - and it
is a vacation - because all Ive
seen you do is frolic in the sea and
shove greek salad down your throat
Ok but it is not indicative of you
spending your life in some kind of
domestic servitude

CELINE
You know what I love about men
They still believe in magic Little
fairies around who pick up their
socks little fairies unload the
dishwasher little fairies sunscreen
the kids Little fairies who make
the fucking Greek salads that you
eat like a pig

JESSE
Okay listen to me all right You
are great at taking care of us You
are I mean you take care of the
kids you take care of your friends
you take care of the world Alright
And you were like that before you
were a mom and now its only magnified
But and Ive been telling you this
for years - you gotta do a little
bit better job taking care of
yourself Ok you do

CELINE
Okay stop patronizing me all right
Im the one at home every night at
600 not 630 I am reliable
Have you ever booked a baby sitter
ever in your entire life NO
What is the name of their
pediatrician

JESSE
Stop quizzing me all right Its
really fucking boring

CELINE
Yeah okay You know what Im at
home every night and I make dinner
I give baths and I read bedtime
stories Sometimes youre there
sometimes youre at a university
event or a publicity tour Ok
When you get inspired you keep on
writing I get inspired too
sometimes you know that

JESSE
You want to write Great Write

CELINE
No but you remember I used to sing
and play guitar and write songs
Id still like to do it But I dont
get to - there isnt time

JESSE
Okay Well first off my writing
isnt a hobby Secondly I wish you
would find the time You somehow
manage to find the time to complain
about 8 hours a day I mean I love
the way you sing Okay I fucked
up my whole life cause of the way
you sing Alright If you took one
eighth of the energy that you spend
on bitching whining and worrying
If you put that energy into playing
scales I mean you would be like
fucking Django Reinhardt

Celine exits

JESSE (CONTD)
Okay All right Whoops You forgot
your shoes
(sighs)
Goddamn Hell

And quickly re-enters

CELINE

You think youre winning

(almost losing her

temper )
Very few people realize what it is
like for an active or passionate
woman to have a child Some friends
told me youll see youll want to
throw them out the window Okay
but the truth is I never wanted to
hurt them once but I thought about
ending it all for myself a hundred
times I was so confused and you
were always away on a stupid book
tour or because of Henrys custody
shit and I didnt want to be a burden
Now I know why Sylvia Plath put her
head in a toaster

JESSE
It was an oven

CELINE

(losing it)
Dont play with words You know
what I mean - toaster oven Same
thing You know how many times I
was alone with the girls crying with
no clue what to do Do you know the
guilt a mother feels when she doesnt
know what to do

JESSE
Do you think you have sole ownership
of that feeling

CELINE
I dont think you understand okay
(a beat)
You know what my secret fear is
With every man Is that they all
want to turn me into a submissive
housewife

JESSE
Okay no one could EVER do that all
right I promise it would be easier
to fit your head into a toaster than
to turn you into anything submissive

The whole conversation has taken on a calmer tone

CELINE
I dont think Ive recovered since
giving birth When they were born
I had no idea what to do People
expect women to have instinct that
kicks in like a female baboon But
I had no idea how to do anything I
loved them so much and I was doing
everything wrong And you were away
so often calling me asking me how
my day went and I couldnt even say
it to you because I felt so ashamed
for being so clueless

JESSE
Look I think you did great

CELINE
No I didnt

JESSE
No you did Well you did a good
job faking it then

CELINE
I remember the only way I could get
them to sleep was to drag that stupid
double stroller down the stairs and
walk them for hours and hours in the
middle of the night all the way to
Pigalle and back I almost got mugged
once I mean the only reason why
the guy didnt attack me was is that
I looked so pathetic The only upside
of being over 35 is that you dont
get raped as much I read it - its
true

Jesse laughs The tone shifts

JESSE
Oh Jesus
(he takes her hand)
Once I remember I was watching the
twins on a trampoline you know and
they looked so beautiful And I was
happy because they were happy you
know One of them had this hula-
hoop that she was using as a jump
rope but then the other one wanted
it so they started fighting over it
All of a sudden I saw it all this
petty jealously and selfishness I
remember thinking this is the natural
(MORE )

JESSE (CONTD)
human state - always a little
dissatisfied perpetually
discontented you know I mean
look at us here we are in a garden
of Eden and we cant stop fighting

CELINE
I dont think there is one natural
human state The human state is
multiple If thats what you see
when youre watching the girls play
that means youre depressed

JESSE
Okay Maybe I am

Celine is slowly getting revved up again

CELINE
When I see them fight I see beautiful
energy of going forward in life and
not letting anyone step on them or
take away what they want I like it
when they fight - it gives me hope
for them

JESSE
Well thats because you see anger as
a positive emotion you know and
you only end up hurting yourself
your work your kids me

CELINE
And you never get angry

JESSE
When I do I dont see it asa
positive

CELINE
You know something The way you
write in your book people come up
to me and think I make love to some
wildcat Henry Miller type HA
You like to have sex the EXACT same
way every time

JESSE
When you got it you got it

CELINE
Kissy kissy Titty titty PUSSY
(snoring)
JESSE
Im a man of simple pleasures

CELINE
Yeah very simple and Ive been
meaning to tell you that lately
Youre no Henry Miller on any level
You know what this room gives me
the creeps I was expecting something
quaint like the real Greece

JESSE
This place is pretty real

CELINE
What the hell are we doing here
anyway This is all too planned
like were supposed to have this
great evening Theres no room for
spontaneity it is all gone from our
lives Its stupid and its not
working

JESSE
Okay Well obviously right

CELINE
Right yeah and I curse Ariadni
and that perv Stefanos for doing
this A couples massage - what the
fuck is that That sounds sleazy to
me

JESSE
We dont have to do it Okay Cmon
this place isnt so bad I like
hotel rooms I think theyre sexy

CELINE
Yeah I know you do Mr Book Tour
Mr Radisson Hilton And I know
that time when you were doing that
reading in Washington when your
cell phone supposedly broke that
night - how convenient Swear on
our kids that you didnt fuck that
lady from the bookstore Emily
Swear to me you didnt fuck that
Emily girl And Im not jealous
because Im not the jealous type but
I just wanna know be a man and admit
the truth

JESSE
I am giving you my whole life okay
Ive got nothing larger to give
Im not giving it to anybody else
If youre looking for permission to
disqualify me Im not going to give
it to you I love you and Im NOT
in conflict about it But if what
you want is a laundry list of all
the things about you that piss me
off I could give it to you

CELINE
Yeah - I want to hear

JESSE
Okay Well uh lets start at number
one - okay number one youre fuckin
nuts alright You are good luck
finding somebody else to put with
your shit for more than like 6 months
But I accept the whole package the
crazy and the brilliant I know
youre not going to change and I
dont want you to Its called
accepting you for being you

CELINE
Yeah okay I asked you a question
If while I was carrying the double
stroller down the stairs and getting
ass-raped in Pigalle you fucked
that little Emily Bronte girl

JESSE
Ok I dont know Emily what Emily
What are you even talking about

CELINE
The one who wrote the nice emails
about Dostoevsky Oh Jesse youre
so right The Grand Commander is
the deepest passage of all Russian
literature

JESSE
If youre asking me if Im committed
to you the girls and the life weve
built together the answer is a
resounding YES

CELINE
So you DID fuck her Thank you very
much

JESSE
Do I ever ask you about the time you
went to go visit your old boyfriend
after his mother died No You
want to know why Because I KNOW
the way that your fucking French ass
works and I guarantee that you at
least blew that guy but I also know
that you love me okay Im okay
with you being a complicated human
being I dont wanna live a boring
life where two people own each other
where two people are institutionalized
in a box that others created - because
that is a bunch of stifling bullshit

Petrified she exits
Jesse sits alone waiting for her to return
Enter Celine She walks in sets her room key down

CELINE
You know whats going on here Its
simple - I dont think I love you
anymore

She exits Jesse sits there gazing from the cold cup of
tea to the door to the full glasses of wine to the rumpled
empty bed Celine doesnt come back

EXT OUTDOOR CAFEBAR - NIGHT

Jesse finds Celine sitting near the same table where they
saw the sunset earlier

JESSE
Miss

CELINE
I dont want to talk right now

JESSE
Are you by yourself Are you waiting
for somebody

CELINE
Yeah Im by myself and happy to be
Im an angry person and I hurt my
kids my work and everyone I love

JESSE
Oh Well just my type

Jesse sits down right across from her

CELINE
Okay Im not in the mood - I came
here to be alone

JESSE
Yeah listen Ive just been checking
you out from across the cafe and I
dont want to make you uncomfortable
but youre by far the best looking
woman in this place

CELINE
Thank you very much

JESSE

bit you know Are you here on
business

JESSE (CONTD)

JESSE
But thats the thing Im not a
stranger No weve met before

CELINE
You are mistaking me for someone
else

JESSE

No we even fell in love

CELINE
Really I vaguely remember someone
sweet and romantic who made me feel
I wasnt alone anymore Someone who
had respect for who I was

JESSE
Thats me Im that guy

CELINE
I dont think so

JESSE
Well see I know something about
tonight that you dont know

CELINE
Really What is that

JESSE
Something important See I know
because Ive actually already lived
through this night

CELINE
How

JESSE
Im a time traveler

CELINE
Okay

JESSE

I have a time machine up in my room
Ive come to save you just like I
said I would

CELINE
Save me from what

JESSE
Save you from being blinded by all
the little bullshit of life

CELINE

remember the sweet romantic one who
you met on a train That is me

CELINE
Thats you
JESSE

CELINE
Guess I didnt recognize you you

What can I say I mean its tough
out there in time and space You
on the other hand are even more
beautiful than I remember

CELINE
Bullshit Jesse this is not a game
You get all cute you get in my
panties and the next thing I know
Im buying peanut butter in Chicago
Youre not going to make it better
by some little pick up line

JESSE
Im not trying to pick you up - no

here as a messenger Ive just
traveled all the way from the future
I was just with your 82 year old
self who gave me a letter to read to
you So here I am

CELINE
Im still alive in my 80s

JESSE
OOOHHHH YEAH

CELINE
Hows my French ass

Do I have a choice

JESSE
Oh sure I mean if youre not
interested in what you have to say

CELINE
No no no Read it
JESSE
Okay here I go Dear Celine Im
writing to you from the other side
of the woods This letter is lighting
a candle

CELINE
Okay stop it I would never write
this - its too flowery Other side
of the woods what fucking woods
Whatre you talking about

JESSE
May I please continue
CELINE
Okay
JESSE

I am sending you this young man

Yes young - and he will be your
escort God knows he has many
problems and has struggled his whole
life connecting and being present
even with those he loves the most

And for that he is deeply sorry -

but you are his only hope Celine

my advice to you is this you are
entering the best years of your life
Looking back from where I sit now
these middle years are only a little
bit more difficult then when you

were 12 and Mathieu and Vanessa danced
all night to the Bee Gees How deep
is your love Celine you will be
fine Your girls will grow up to
become examples and icons of feminism

CELINE
Nice one

JESSE
Yeah well you know what I just
noticed theres a Post Script at
the bottom looks kind of important
Maybe I should just skip over the
rest of this boring stuff and get to
that

CELINE
Yeah skip away Please skip away

JESSE
Okay You sure
CELINE
Yeah

JESSE
Okay all right well

CELINE
The boring stuff

Jesse scoots his chair closer to her

JESSE

Yeah Okay

(looks around lowers

his voice)
Yeah its like financial tips
horoscopes boring stuff Okay here
it is PS By the way the best
sex of my life happened one night in
the Southern Peloponnese Dont
miss it My whole sexual being went
to a new ground-breaking level

CELINE
Ground-breaking Great

JESSE
Yeah I dont know what that means

CELINE
Okay Jesse can you stop this stupid
game Were not in one of your
stories Okay Did you hear what I
said to you back in the room Did
you hear me

JESSE
Yes I heard you - that you dont
love me anymore I figured you didnt
mean it but if you did then fuck
it You know something Youre
just like the little girls and
everybody else - you want to live in
some fairy tale Im just trying to
make things better here I tell you
I love you unconditionally I tell
you that youre beautiful I tell
you that your ass looks great when
youre 80 Im trying to make you
laugh I put up with plenty of your
shit and if you think Im just some
dog whos gonna keep coming back
then youre wrong But if you want
true love - this is it

(MORE )
JESSE (CONTD)
This is real life Its not perfect
but its real And if you cant see
it then youre blind alright I
give up

Jesse crumples up the napkinletter he was reading from and
tosses it on the table What follows is a lengthy silent
sequence where they just sort of stare at each other
seemingly going through everything past and present

CELINE
So what about this time machine

JESSE
What do you mean

CELINE
How does it work

JESSE
Well its complicated

CELINE
Am I going to have to get naked to
operate it

Jesses mood shifts and the camera starts to slowly pull
away from them as they continue talking

JESSE
Yeah actually Yeah its been a
real issue you know clothes dont
travel well through the whole space-
time continuum

CELINE
(bimbo voice)
Wow Youre so smart

JESSE
Oh Jesus

CELINE
Space-time

JESSE
Continuum

CELINE
‚ÄòContinuum

JESSE

Yeah
CELINE
Wow

JESSE
You know theres something I have
been thinking about about your
letter You mention something about
the southern Peloponesse Were in
the southern Peloponesse

CELINE
Yeah

JESSE
Do you think it could be tonight
that youre still talking about in
your 80s

CELINE
Well it must have been one hell of
a night were about to have

The camera has now pulled far away and the conversation has
become inaudible We leave them as just another couple
sitting and talking at a table on a beautiful night on the
coast of Greece

FADE OUT
