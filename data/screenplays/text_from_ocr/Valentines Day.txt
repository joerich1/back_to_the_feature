More than 80 VENDORS begin their day readying their stalls
at the downtown flower mart where Angelenos come to buy the
freshest most extravagant flora in town Its always
springtime here

INT REED BENNETT’S HOUSE - MID-WILSHIRE - 5 AM

REED BENNETT (late 20s) wakes up easily naturally
Handsome rugged Smile on his face happy to be alive He
looks at the clock beside him 5 am Softly he turns his
head MORLEY CLARKSON (late 20s) lays sound asleep beside
him

Reed gets up Pulls on pajama bottoms Then reaches under
the bed and pulls out a small box Opens it The perfect
engagement ring inside

He sits on the bed looking at her sleeping face Softly
pulls her left hand out from under the pillow

Reed now holds her naked left hand When Morley wakes up
Catches the scene She starts to say something but

REED
I know you don’t like a big mushy
romantic scene No skywriting No
writing your name in flower petals

She laughs

REED (CONTD)
Just you and me Together And
frankly that’s all I want That’s
all I need I love you Morley
Will you marry me

He looks at her expectantly And breathes a sigh of relief
as she SMILES

EXT REED BENNETT’S HOUSE - 540 AM
Reed now wearing a dark blue mechanics style jacket with the
words “Rita Flora” on the back athletically barrels down the

stairs Energy high Excitement on his face

He gets inside a DELIVERY VAN

INT RITA FLORA DELIVERY VAN - CONTINUOUS

Reed hops into the passenger side ALPHONSO 40s and from El
Salvador is at the wheel He looks at Reed studying him

ALPHONSO

She said no I knew it
REED

You did
ALPHONSO

REED
She said yes

ALPHONSO
That’s great

REED
Why would she say no

ALPHONSO
I don’t know why I said that I
prepare for the worst Part of the
immigrant mentality But - she
said yes

Reed regains his enthusiasm

REED

She said yes She said YES I’m
still trying to process Morley is
actually going to marry me I’m
getting married And today I can
be the kind of cheeseball who tells
random people at the ATM about it
because it’s Valentine’s Day and
people are all about love today

Alphonso pulls the VAN away NEARLY HITTING A PASSING CAR
ROAD RAGER (VO)
WILL YOU USE YOUR FREAKING TURN
SIGNAL YOU FREAKING PANSY
Alphonso turns to Reed who smiles as they pull away

INT KTLA - 558 AM

The set of the KTLA news is a flurry activity as the morning
show is about to go on the air
2189 3
KELVIN late 30s African-American walks briskly through the
set holding a piece of paper

He spots SUSAN 50s across the stage and makes a bee-line
for her As he approaches he holds up the paper He’s

clearly annoyed

KELVIN
What the hell is this

Susan half-smiles seeming to enjoy his frustration

SUSAN
That’s your assignment Kelvin
KELVIN
My assignment Since when do I get
assignments
SUSAN
Since there’s nothing else going

on
Susan turns and walks through the stage Kelvin follows

KELVIN
I’m the sports anchor Susan
There’s always something going on

SUSAN
The Super Bowl was last week
There are only two NBA games
tonight No one gives a crap about
hockey Like I said there’s
nothing going on

KELVIN
Actually I was working on something
big -

Susan stops getting a little annoyed

SUSAN
What were you working on Kelvin
Was another one of the Cincinnati
Bengals arrested You got a tip on
another referee fixing basketball
games Oooh - maybe you’ve got an
exclusive one on one with Michael
Vicks dog trainer

KELVIN
Ummm - no —-
2189 4

SUSAN
It’s Valentine’s Day All I want
is your basic man on the street
remote about what this day means to
people I want happy I want
romance I want love

KELVIN
And you should have that But
seriously Susan - I’m not the right
guy I hate Valentine’s Day
Least favorite holiday It’s not
even a holiday really we don’t
get the day off So we have to go
to work AND buy shit for people we
might not even know in two weeks
No thanks

Susan laughs -

SUSAN
Come on -

KELVIN
I’m serious It’s the single man’s
worst nightmare I shut down
dating from New Years Eve til
Presidents Day just to avoid the
whole thing Saves me a lot of
cash and heartache

Susan looks at him almost sympathetically

SUSAN
Well be that as it may - you’re a
professional I know you don’t
like soccer but you give those
Galaxy scores with a smile on your
face You’ll do fine

She turns and leaves him standing there
EXT FLOWER MART - DOWNTOWN LA - 600 AM

INT AIRPLANE - 600 AM

Jumbo jet Long overnight flight All the passengers are
asleep fervently lost in their individual dreams

She pins a heart on her lapel Happy Valentine’s Day
Smacks it and it blinks red She begins her hourly rounds

Couple after couple asleep Until she stops at one A white
woman KATE (30s) in a military uniform has fallen asleep
on the shoulder of HOLDEN (30s) an African-American man

He leans into her comforted by her warmth

The Flight Attendant pulls up the single blanket wrapping
them both tighter into a cocoon

EXT FLOWER MART - VENDOR - 630 AM

As Reed walks the aisles empty-handed he’s jostled by all
the other buyers loaded down with fresh flowers

Unperturbed by the rudeness Reed keeps smiling wishing all
the Vendors by name a good morning

Finally Reed finds a heavyset Italian ex-New Yorker with
coffee spilled down his shirt GUISEPPE (50s)

Reed walks right behind the counter and smacks a kiss on
Guiseppe’s cheek

REED
Guiseppe I need you

GUISEPPE
Great But could you stand camera
right You’re blocking my good
angle

Guiseppe points to a three-man CAMERA CREW shooting close-ups

Morley said yes so I’m gonna need
something --

IN THE BACK

Guiseppe - followed by Reed - goes deep into the
refrigerator Pulls out something in a LONG BLACK CLOSED

BOX

REED
What’s in it

He starts to open it But Guiseppe stops him with a loud

gruff

GUISEPPE
No Don’t open it until it’s just
the right time

REED
The right time

GUISEPPE
Just trust me Reed I had this
handpicked and flown over from
Thailand just in case you needed
magic
2189 7

best

BACK OUT FRONT

Reed with the black box and Guiseppe return Kelvin

understood why She’s hot that
Meg Ryan

Kelvin And California produces
about sixty percent of them

KELVIN

Reed smiles easily into the camera

REED

KELVIN
Ah as a florist you must hear

hears it Smiles in the camera

KELVIN

KELVIN

GUISEPPE REED

2189 10

Julia is now a whirl getting dressed Shoes flying skirt

catch up and get ready to leave when he leaves

JULIA
A recently divorced handsome
doctor such as yourself doesn’t
know what it’s like to be single
But for us unhitched gals well it
sucks It’s like some sort of
cosmic bitch-slap for singlefolk
The Universe saying “Hey you
Remember what it felt like when
you still had braces and cystic
acne and no one wanted to ask you
to winter formal Well nothing’s
changed”

Harrison smiles

HARRISON
I would take you to winter formal
And I definitely would have
prescribed you some Retin A for the
skin

She smiles back at him but her attention is pulled to the TV
screen

--Love is still the most shocking
act left on the planet

Julia smiles big

Hello

Liz smiles shyly at him
2189 12

LIZ
Hi
JASON
I’m used to seeing you every
morning -- but not exactly like
this
She laughs
LIZ

Would you prefer I were naked and
wrapped in a sheet when you drop
packages at my desk

JASON
As a matter of fact I would I
don’t think that would be breaking
any kind of office regulations

He puts his arms around her and they start to kiss
passionately

LIZ
This however might start to draw
attention

Jason laughs

JASON
How is it possible that we didn’t
start hanging out until three weeks
ago

LIZ
I don’t know Maybe you were
scoping out some of the other
assistants

JASON
I don’t think so

They kiss again They are all smiles as Liz glances at the
clock

LIZ
So I guess I better get going
soon

JASON

Uh OK Great

She hesitates for a moment waiting for something
2189 13

LIZ (CONTD)
Well OK I guess I’1ll just see
you there

She hesitates again looking at Jason He looks back at her
Again - she’s waiting for something He’s clearly not sure
what And whatever it is doesn’t come She finally gets up
INT CAR - DAY

Liz drives a little Hyundai - pulls up to a stoplight on
Beverly Blvd

awkward as they wait for the light It FINALLY turns green

I’m kidding
(handing his apron to a
clerk)
Can you take over for me for a

stranger Who wants that

Morley looks up at Reed - who is suppressing a smile

REED
I don’t know - that sounds kind of
nice Maybe I should wear the
ring

MORLEY
I’ve always wondered why men don’t
have to wear engagement rings
They’re engaged too

REED
Good point I feel slighted

diamond with pave band - you are
more of a man than I even thought

She thought it was a beautiful
ring just not the right ring

Julia bites her lip instantly sensitive for him
2189 26

REED
It just wasn’t her speed It’s
fine

JULIA

I guess But I feel like if
Harrison and I ever got engaged or
anything I’d be happy with a cigar
band

REED
Wow Things are going well with
him then

JULIA
Yeah He had to go to San
Francisco today I was thinking of
surprising him You know fly up
there and rock his world on the
Golden Gate Bridge Too much

REED
I don’t think so

JULIA
Really So if a girl did that for
you you wouldn’t be freaked out

REED
No I love spontaneity

Julia considers this then smiles

JULIA
That’s true I remember in college
you made me drive around all night
with you looking for the perfect
donut That was spontaneous

These aren’t just any mailroom guys - these guys are good

looking dressed well agents in the making

DANNY
She wouldn’t even give you a ride

JASON

DANNY
So why are you telling me

He has a good point but before Jason can respond JED a

third mailroom guy enters carrying TWO GIANT FLOWER

ARRANGEMENTS

JED
Dude I hate Valentine’s Day Why
can’t these pansy guys just go
upstairs and deliver their flowers
to their girlfriends themselves

JASON

Only you didn’t say a word because
you were afraid

EDGAR
That’s right So she pushed me
aside and said “Move big fella”

EDISON
But you kept coming back every day
until she agreed to go out with

give them at home It seems more
personal that way

Alphonso’s having a tough time with the damaged doors

ALPHONSO
People like to get flowers at their
place of work They like a public
declaration It’s like - love
doesn’t exist until you acknowledge

Julia looks at Madison suspicious But the students do what
Madison says Rani turns her envelope upside down and out
falls the big Valentine caught on a staple She opens it

Both look at her But say nothing
JULIA
When there’s that much silence I
know you’re thinking up a lie
KARA

Madison looks at Kara furious

Reed enters the classroom quietly carrying a single
arrangement of two dozen red roses

Julia doesn’t see him Many of the students do however and
Reed puts a finger to his lips Shhh

JULIA
Madison Take all of your
Valentines and bring them up here
If you’re good you might get them
back at the end of the day Kara
I’m afraid this goes for you too

KARA
But I told the truth

Both girls angrily and tearfully give up their Valentines
JULIA
It’s not nice to play with people’s
hearts like that

When a cough comes behind Julia

REED

Julia turns surprised Happy to see him

JULIA
Reed What are you doing here

Edison recognizing Reed thinks he’s delivering the roses he
ordered that morning He stands up excited
2189 53

Reed was supposed to give him the flowers She opens the
card hoping Smiles

JULIA

Edison sits back down shocked Not his flowers He is not

When EDISON bursts through the doors Frantic He grabs
Reed’s shirt Calls him by the store’s name

EDISON

Reed’s blank trying to place him out of the environment

EDISON
I gave you thirteen dollars

Reed puts an arm on Edison’s shoulders

REED
Oh yeah I remember now They

man Don’t worry they’1ll get here

EDISON
You promised me Fifth period I
chose you because you were on TV
this morning when I was writing my
Valentines It was a sign

Julia kneels down consoles him

JULIA

REED
Just making a quick stop at my
house -

ALPHONSO
But we’re really behind -

Reed pulls the van over in front of his house puts it in
park
2189 57

REED
I know but -

Reed reaches into the back of the van and pulls out
GIUSEPPE’S BLACK BOX

REED
- we’re in the neighborhood and I
wanna put these flowers out before
my bride-to-be comes home You
know - surprise her I’11 be fast

ALPHONSO

Reed opens the door takes the black box and hops out
Then through the window -

REED
Oh by the way I didn’t tell
Julia about Harrison

Reed starts to walk away Alphonso calls after him

ALPHONSO
What She needs to know Reed

Reed stops halfway up his walk
REED
I tried I couldn’t do it to her
I just - don’t think it’s my place
Alphonso just looks at him not hiding his disapproval

ALPHONSO
We’re really behind

Reed reaches the top of the stairs still holding the black
box and turns into the

INT BEDROOM - SAME
Morley sits on the bed

REED
Hey

MORLEY
Hey

Reed just stands there looking at her not knowing what to
say She does not look happy

REED
What are you doing home

Morley doesn’t say anything As he starts to approach her
he sees the CLOSET DOOR IS OPEN AND THE CLOSET IS EMPTY
He stops

He looks at Morley Then to her packed suitcase on the
floor It’s all starting to make sense

MORLEY
I’m sorry Reed

Reed stands there in shock holding the black box

REED
It’s not the ring It’s me

She looks at him and though it appears to pain her she
doesn’t argue

MORLEY
I’m so sorry I should have been
honest this morning It just - it
took me by surprise and I didn’t
want to hurt you

(MORE )
2189 59

MORLEY (contd)
No one prepares girls for how to
handle that scenario They prepare
us to say yes not how to
gracefully say no

Reed is clearly trying to remain upbeat

REED
Look it’s fine If you’re not
ready that’s OK We can take the
whole marriage thing off the table
Maybe I shouldn’t have surprised
you like that - we’ve only been
together a year - maybe we should
have talked about it --

She stops him

MORLEY
You didn’t do anything wrong And
it shouldn’t have been a surprise
to me I should have been thinking
about our future too But I
wasn’t I was just coasting
knowing in my heart that we were
not gonna go the distance And
that is not fair to you You
deserve a lot better than that

Morley takes the engagement ring from her pocket hands it to
Reed He studies the ring for a moment then finally looks
up at Morley

REED
Did you even consider marrying me
Even for a minute

MORLEY
Of course But when you ask
someone to marry you - do you want
her to consider it Or should she
just know the answer

Off Reed letting that sink in
INT RITA FLORA DELIVERY VAN - DAY
Reed gets back into the van still holding the black box

Alphonso looks at him He’s clearly upset They sit there
for a long quiet moment
2189 60

REED
You’re not gonna believe this
Morley was in there She’s leaving
me We’re not getting married

Alphonso looks at him Doesn’t say anything But he doesn’t
look surprised Reed starts to lose it

REED
So this you believe You don’t
believe it when she says yes but
you believe it when she moves out

Alphonso shrugs not saying anything

REED
You knew

ALPHONSO
I had a feeling

REED
What feeling

ALPHONSO
That it just wasn’t right An
inkling

REED
An inkling Why didn’t you say
something

ALPHONSO

I didn’t know for sure

Reed takes this in trying to process Then something dawns
on him

REED
But I do
ALPHONSO

water fountain is behind him in the background

GROVE EMPLOYEE
It’s pretty busy at the movies

Sometimes with themselves

Then he composes himself continuing the interview

How much cash do you want to drop

JASON
I don’t really know

CLERK
What do you want the gift to say to
your woman

JASON
I’m not really sure

The CLERK is really trying to understand

JASON (CONTD)
I have no idea what I’m doing
I’ve been going out with this girl
for like two and a half weeks But
then today I was getting a little
bit of a brush-offy vibe

(MORE )
2189

JASON (CONTD)
And I say going out but if you
want to get really technical about
it we’ve never actually said we
were going out - so it may still
just be in the hanging out
category Weve slept together
once- and I realize I’m oversharing
- but I guess that might not really
mean anything And then we work
together so that’s another
wrinkle

The clerk takes this in

CLERK
It’s OK man Let me help you
You’re taking her out tonight
right

Jason nods

CLERK (CONTD)
Sweet So what you need to do is
read the vibe when you get there

Jason nods again

CLERK (CONTD)
If you can tell that she is not
feeling you at all -

The clerk reaches into the case and grabs a SMALL SILVER
CASE

CLERK (CONTD)
You bust this out Silver business
card holder Definitely sends a “I
can tell this isn’t gonna work out
but we still work together and I
want to be respectful” message

JASON
Okay

The clerk reaches into the case again -
CLERK
But if it’s going good and she’s
flirting you up you whip out this
one

He shows Jason a TINY SILVER LOCKET

2189 67

CLERK (CONTD)
Feminine Delicate I’ve hit this
up on like four girls

JASON
So you want me to buy two gifts

CLERK
I’m hooking you up bro Don’t
worry Bring back the one you
don’t use and I’1l1 totally refund
it
Jason smiles

JASON
That is a fantastic idea

(to the Player)
Can’t you see my heart is broken

Edison stays right where he is the lone man on the center of
the field Finally the COACH calls time out Walks up to
Edison Friendly hand on his shoulder

EDISON
Sporting events such as these
feel trivial at the moment Coach
The Coach has no response for that

WITH JANICE

As she sits on the grassy hill Her PHONE BUZZES She looks
at it a NEW TEXT from Alex It reads LOOK BEHIND YOU

Janice turns around but sees nothing but the beginning of a
wooded area about 10 feet behind her She texts back WHAT

She watches Edison meander around the field for a second
before she gets another text LOOK CLOSER

She turns around again this time scanning the wooded area
Then she sees Alex standing at the tree line waving her
over

She looks quite confused She checks on Edison who’s still
moping through his soccer game then gets up and walks over
to Alex

JANICE
What the hell is going on

He gives her a mischievous look and beckons her into the
woods

ALEX
So you know how I said I’d figure
something out

JANICE

As they come up to a small clearing -

ALEX
Well -

Janice sees how Alex has figured it out - he’s fashioned a

BED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WOODS with pillows blankets
He’s put some colorful flowers all
But Janice is not

sleeping bags etc
around It’s actually kinda cool

impressed

JANICE
This is your big idea

ALEX
Yeah

JANICE
You want me to do it here In the
woods

ALEX
It’s rustic And romantic It’s
romantically rustic

JANICE
With random people 20 feet away

ALEX
No I checked I’ve been screaming
obscenities for an hour There’s
no way they can hear us

JANICE
So let me get this straight You
really thought that I was going to
come back here in the woods and
have SEX WITH YOU outdoors while
I left alone the 10 year old boy
who I’m responsible for Just left
him alone out there You thought
that would be fun for me You
think that’s romantic

Alex realizes the holes in his plan
2189 70

(meekly)
I promised I’d figure it out

REED
Look I know what this seems like
I’m just some other shlemiel who
cheated on his girlfriend and now
he’s here with his sob story
begging you to let him go chase the
girl down and tell her how it was
all a big misunderstanding and that
the email with all the naked
pictures was actually just a gag by
one of his fraternity buddies

The ticket agent looks vaguely disturbed

UNITED TICKET AGENT
That’s a terrible story

REED
Right So let me tell you my
story The girl I’m running to
catch isn’t even my girlfriend
But I have to tell her that her
boyfriend - they guy she’s about to
get on a plane and surprise - is
married And it’s a crappy thing
to hear But I have to do it
because it’s the right thing to do
Because she’s a great girl and
she’d even take a cigar band from a
guy - and I know I’m getting a
little off track here but my point
is - I have to go get her

Compared to the earlier story the ticket agent likes this

one He starts punching the keys of his computer

REED
You’re not answering the question
Honestly - as my friend -

JULIA
Fine No Not really Don’t see
it Don’t see you two together

REED

Well that’s why I’m doing this

Because apparently everyone and
their mother knew I shouldn’t
propose to her but no one had the
guts to say anything - and now
she’s gone and I’m left with this
stupid ring and an empty closet and
I don’t want you to make the same

mistake I did Don’t pursue a dead

end Julia It hurts like hell

Julia stares at him trying to process this

having it

Reed doesn’t know what to say

JULIA
You are unbelievable You expect

me to buy that - that you’re trying

to help me You’re just doing this

something and you have nothing

Let me ask you a question Kelvin
What are your plans for tonight

Kelvin seems confused

KELVIN
Umm - I really just came here to
try and get the exclusive with Sean
- but -
2189

KARA
No - I know And I’m not asking
you out or anything It just seems
like literally everyone on earth
has something to do tonight so -

Kelvin looks at her gauging her seriousness

KELVIN
I’m working 5pm 10pm and llpm
newscasts I usually only do one
of those but everyone wanted off
tonight and I’m more than happy to
oblige It’s one of the perks of
having a night job - there’s always
excuse not to participate in all
this ridiculousness

Kara gives a small smile satisfied by the answer
up walks over to the couch sits next to Kelvin

KARA
I haven’t had a date on Valentine’s
day in almost 10 years I mean —

it’s mostly by choice I put all
my energy into this job into
taking care of my clients - and I
know I don’t put myself out there
at all - but still - 10 years
Isn’t that pathetic

KELVIN
I don’t think so I don’t think
Ive ever had one Again by
choice but -

KARA
The thing that I hate most about
this day - honestly - is that I’m
embarrassed I’m embarrassed that
it makes me feel as bad about being
alone as it does

She gets

Kara starts to tear up again She puts her head in her
hands now really crying Kelvin sits there not knowing
what to do He puts his ARM AROUND HER and she sinks into

him sobbing now

After a few moments her crying subsides She pulls back

from Kelvin wipes her eyes now embarrassed

KARA (CONTD)
I’m really sorry I don’t even
know you
2189 78

She gets up and goes back to her desk He gets up as well
in a bit of shock

KARA (CONTD)
Anyway - I’m sending word out now
that Sean’s press conference will
be at 6 at the Century Plaza

KELVIN
Oh OK

KARA
Sorry you came all this way for
nothing

KELVIN

No It was - no problem

Kelvin looks at her mind searching for something else to
say He comes up with nothing So he just turns and goes

EDISON

Janice takes a breath and then dives in

JANICE
Alex and I were supposed to have
sex today For the first time
Both of us for the first time

Edgar and Estelle share a look careful not to show any
judgement

JANICE (CONTD)
And it was supposed to be -
magical But I’m realizing now how
hard it is to plan something
magical

ESTELLE
That it is

JANICE
I just wanted something special to
carry us through you know He’s
going to Stanford I’m going to
Yale - it’s going to be nearly
impossible to stay together These
things never work out I know
that But I just thought if we had
something really amazing connecting
us that we might have a better
shot

Janice stops takes stock of what’s she’s been saying

JANICE (CONT’D)
And now - saying it all out loud -
I just feel stupid
(MORE)

with just one person in my entire
life That’s just - preposterous
Who does that

A small smile comes across Edgar’s face He looks to
Estelle then back to Janice

EDGAR
We did

Janice looks at them in disbelief

JANICE
No

Edgar nods proudly

JANICE (CONT’D)
That’s amazing

EDGAR
Now granted it was a different
time People married earlier and
weren’t as promiscuous as they are
now They were more promiscuous
than the movies of the time would
lead you to believe but still

Edgar looks to Estelle trying to bring her into the
conversation but she looks - odd She’s staring off
meeting his eye Edgar continues

EDGAR (CONT’D)
And we went through several periods
where we were apart - months where
I was away on business or Estelle
was off on location - and we
managed to make it through

not

As Edgar keeps talking tears begin to well up in Estelle’s
eyes He’s oblivious while Janice becomes aware something

is wrong

EDGAR (CONT’D)
Now I’m not saying it was easy or
even that it’s something that you
should do But just that it’s
possible And it’s the thing I’m
most proud of Being faithful to
one woman is the greatest
accomplishment of my life
2189 81

Edgar finishes smiling but Janice is now focused on
Estelle who has tears running down her face

ESTELLE

for awhile

You
EDGAR

I’d like to thank everyone for
coming here tonight And I’m not
gonna waste y’alls time with some
long winded thing here - I’m just
gonna get to it The cliche is -
when someone’s retiring who really
doesn’t want to retire - they say
it’s because they want to spend
more time with their family But I
don’t have a family And with
everything football has given me -
the biggest thing it’s taken away
is that Because of who I am
because of my job I can’t lead the
life I want to So with that in
mind Ill just say the thing I
came here to say

They meet eyes He gives

Doesnt need

Sean looks out over the crowd gets a huge smile on his face

me

asses

goes like this I was nineteen
Estelle was eighteen I was an
architect I worked in the front
office with a big window She
would come out every morning and
post the mail I thought she was
the prettiest girl I’d ever seen
so I got up my courage and waited
by the postbox to say hello Only
I didn’t say a word because I was
afraid So she pushed me aside
and said “Move big fella” But I
kept coming back every day until
she agreed to go out with me

JASON
That’s a nice story
EDGAR
It is Too bad it’s as you say
bullshit

I mean don’t get me wrong all of
that happened But the part I
leave out is what happened after
Our first date was a crushing
failure

put so much pressure on that one
date that it was bound to fail
Our second date we went on a walk
That’s it It wasn’t until we
stripped away all expectation that
we really began to fall in love

Edgar looks back at the screen at the beautiful image of his
young wife Jason does too thinking about what he’s heard

INT ANARKALI INDIAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Kara and Kelvin now sit at the booth talking the flowers
between them She still can’t stop smiling

KARA
So wait - how did you find me

KELVIN
Your assistant Jan and I have
become pretty close today - so -

Kara laughs

Right

They look at each other not knowing what to say next But
it’s not a bad silence - sort of a good hopeful awkward one

KELVIN
So - I have to know Did you know
about Sean I mean - before today

Kara tries to hide her smile

KARA
I did I had my suspicions for a
while but he finally told me a few
years ago I think I was one of
the only people he ever told

(MORE )
2189 102

KARA (contd)

And I guess I always assumed he’d
retire at some point and just fade
away - get a chance to lead the
life he wanted - but -

(she thinks about it)
I don’t know Seeing him up there
doing what he did - it just made me
realize -

KELVIN
You can have both

KARA
Yeah You can have both

Kara and Kelvin look at each other a definite connection
Which is broken by the door opening JULIA ENTERS

JULIA
I am so sorry I’m late

Kara looks up - can’t believe it Julia comes over and joins
them still holding the shopping bags from the restaurant

KARA
What are you doing here What
happened

JULIA
I - it doesn’t matter I’m here
now

Kara can tell by the look on her face that it’s not good

JULIA
Look I just - I really don’t wanna
talk about it

She starts to unpack the shopping bags - exquisite DESSERTS
from Crustacean about 20 of them

JULIA
Anyway - my contribution to the
party Molten lava chocolate
hearts Normally 100 bucks a pop
But I got a great deal

Kelvin helps her unpack the remaining desserts As he does -

JULIA
Hi I’m Julia

She extends her hand He shakes it

with your old boyfriend

Dana and Elise share a look Then in unison -

DANA AND ELISE

pull off

Julia and Kara look at each other in disbelief

DANA

who shoots her a smile She smiles back taking in her
party which actually didn’t turn out half bad

for some kind of miracle

As she waits there a VAN pulls up to her left and stops at
the light We can clearly see EDISON SITTING IN THE

Janice continues to look around the intersection oblivious
to Edison right next to her

But when the light turns green the van starts to pull away
Janice looks to her left at the last second catching a
glimpse of Edison (who doesn’t see her) Her eyes go WIDE

But as the van passes she sees the RITA FLORA logo and
relaxes a bit She changes lanes and gets behind the van
following up La Brea

Alex just looks at her

JANICE (CONT’D)
I’m really sorry Alex

Alex doesn’t know what to say He just opens the door and
gets out of the car

Edison spots Julia at the back table He approaches and as
he nears Julia turns and sees him -

opens it looks inside and looks for a good long time at its
contents before she closes the box and smiles at Edison

JULIA
Well that’s amazingly nice Edison
I’m not sure why you’re doing this
but-

EDISON
Because I love you

Julia looks at Edison heart breaking She kneels down to
his level looks him in the eye talks to him quietly

JULIA
Listen - I’m sure you’re pretty
serious about this - but you don’t
really love me I’m your teacher

EDISON
But I do

JULIA
OK I don’t think - you just -

Julia’s really floundering

EDISON
Youre saying I have no shot with
you

Julia laughs out loud

EDISON
Oh I get that The age difference
alone would be difficult to
overcome I just - I want to give
you flowers I feel like you
deserve so much more than you’re
getting

This really hits Julia hard He’s right As she tries to
process this she sees REED TAKE A FEW MORE STEPS INTO THE
RESTAURANT THEY LOCK EYES

JULIA
Honestly Edison this is the
nicest thing anyone has ever done
for me Sadly I mean that
(MORE )
2189 111

JULIA (contd)
But I really think you should be
giving this to someone else

Edison looks confused

EDISON
Who

JULIA
Someone who’s more - appropriate
Someone who can appreciate these
more than I can

Julia looks to the back of the restaurant where RANI STANDS
watching the scene Edison looks to Rani then back to
Julia

EDISON
Rani But I don’t love her She’s
just my friend

JULIA
OK What makes Rani your friend

EDISON
I don’t know She has Tom Waits on
her iPod That’s pretty cool fora
fifth grader

Julia smiles then looks to Reed

JULIA
Well sometimes those things you
like about someone as a friend -
they’re the things that turn them
into someone you love

Reed looks at Julia affected by what she’s said Edison
considers this

Reed watches as Edison stands across from Rani at the front
of the restaurant

EDISON
I’m really sorry about what those
girls did to you today

RANT
That’s OK They’re not that smart

EDISON
They’re not right

Edison stands there awkwardly holding the black box
2189 114

EDISON

He hands her the bouquet She takes the box opens it

Pulls out the SINGLE FLOWER It’s a RARE THAI PARROT FLOWER
Deep vibrant purple like no other flower you’ve ever seen

age but you’re pretty
sophisticated

RANT
Thank you

Silence

EDISON
I don’t really have anything else
to say

RANI
Me either

Rani smiles at Edison He smiles back

WITH REED - as he approaches Julia at the other side of the
restaurant

REED
So You’re here

JULIA
Yep Back at the Valentine’s Day
singles dinner A loser once
again
(off the reaction of the
other party guests)
Sorry guys

Reed takes her arm gently guides her a bit away
REED
You are not a loser You just -
deserve better

Julia smiles a bit taken aback by the compliment

REED
So why didn’t you go
2189

Reed looks at her

JULIA

Honestly Because somewhere deep
inside I did know I knew that it
wasn’t right But I also knew that
you were getting married and that
what you and I had our friendship
as we knew it was going to end

So I just blinded myself to all the
signs Because I didn’t want to be
left with nothing

one imperceptible step towards her

REED
And now that I have nothing

Julia stands her ground matches his smile

Reed now breaks out into a wide grin

JULIA
Then I guess we can both have
nothing Together

can’t help herself

report

Off camera - Susan watches pleased

away from

KELVIN
I’d like to take a moment and
comment on the story we reported
earlier - Sean Jackson’s coming
out A ground-breaking day in
sports for sure - Mr Jackson’s
name likely to be remembered along
side the likes of Jackie Robinson
Muhammad Ali Billie Jean King
But let’s let future generations
decide where to place this Today
of all days I would like to look
at this act not as one of defiance
or wall-busting or history making -
but simply as this what a man
will do for love
