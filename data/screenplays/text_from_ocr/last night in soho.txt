Story by

Edgar Wright
INT BLACK SPACE - UNKNOWN 1

Music plays ‘A WORLD WITHOUT LOVE’ by Peter and Gordon

A long dark hallway lit at the far end by an open door A
silhouette appears in the doorway - the outline of a woman
stylish and dressed in a beautiful gown

She struts down the dark corridor dress flowing She dances
carving shapes in the light The embodiment of cool class
and elegance She hits a switch-

INT UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - DAY 2

The hallway floods with light Jarringly we find ourselves
not in some nightclub but in the upstairs hallway of a cozy
home Adorned with pictures and photos that suggest the
domicile of a much older person

The dancer is ELOISE TURNER 18 Way messier than her
silhouette suggested Hair in a rough bun The beautiful
dress is actually made of newspaper a dressmaking pattern
expertly cut and pinned

Eloise continues to dance down the hallway Her moves are
quirky weird and more than a little awkward She’s dancing
for herself lost in her own world She shimmies down the
chintzy hallway right into-

INT ELOISES BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS 3

A shrine to the ‘60s A portable record player blasts music
across this half-bedroom half-fashion workroom

Eloise is Holly Golightly redux as she takes the straw out of
a can of Coke and uses it as a cigarette holder She vamps
around the room which is covered in panoramas art and icons
from the 60s She winks at a poster of Twiggy before dancing
around a dressmaker’s mannequin She lifts it and spins
attempting a waltz

As she dances we see framed photos on her bedside table

-Eloise’s MOTHER and GRANDMOTHER PEGGY in mid 90s London
posing outside the Criterion restaurant

-Eloise her mother and Peggy in mid 2000s London outside of
Libertys

-Eloise and Peggy in 2017 in a rural hamlet Her mother is
absent

Beside the frames is a shrine to London a little dinky red
phone box a toy black cab a tiny Carnaby Street sign

Eloise dips the mannequin and then puts her head where its
should be She imitates a male voice

ELOISE
Beautiful gown darling

Eloise leans back bashfully

ELOISE (CONTD)
Thank you Fabulous

ELOISE (CONTD)
Who are you wearing

ELOISE (CONTD)
Eloise Turner

Eloise waltzes away from the mannequin and over to a rail of
clothes She pulls a 1960’s silk scarf from the rail and
shimmies over to a full length bedroom mirror In her mind
the paparazzo along the red carpet

Behind the rail she strikes a fierce pose in a dress

ELOISE (CONTD)
Who are you wearing

ELOISE (CONTD)
Eloise T of course

Nope She strikes another pose

ELOISE (CONTD)
ET

Big nope She shakes her head

ELOISE (CONTD)
Ellie Turner

Yes That’s the one She wraps the scarf around her head like
she’s a ‘60s film star Bardot eat your heart out

She spins and flicks the scarf through the air It knocks one
of the photo frames off her bedside table and onto the floor
The one of her her mother and grandmother

As she kneels down to retrieve it her large dress knocks the
record player BUMP The record skips repeats
Ellie kneels down to grab it looks at it for a beat Her
finger traces the image of her mother

She stands to place the frame back on her bedside table As

she does her eyes catch in the mirror - A FIGURE behind her
hovering in the doorway A smile creeps across her face and

she turns to see-

Her MOTHER looking as she does in the photo far too young
to have an 18 year old daughter She smiles back at Ellie
warm dripping with love Ellie matches it

ELLIE
It’s good news isn’t it

Her mother nods Then from downstairs we hear an older
voice shout

PEGGY (0S)
Eloise POST

Ellie looks around excitedly upon hearing this She then
dashes to the record player and takes the stylus off

PEGGY (0S) (CONTD)
Ellie

When she heads through the door her mother has vanished
ELLIE
Coming
INT DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER 4
Ellie bounds down the stairs She stops on the landing to see
her grandmother PEGGY 70s holding an envelope up Ellie

takes the last few stairs two at a time and grabs the letter

She holds it for a second “LONDON COLLEGE OF FASHION” is
printed on the outside

She takes a breath trying to calm her nerves She opens the
envelope Peggy watches on anxiously as Ellie reads

PEGGY
Well what does it say

ELLIE
I’m going to London

PEGGY
I knew you would be
ELLIE
I’m going to London I’m going to
London

Ellie screams and bounces around excitedly Too wrapped up in
her own joy to catch the flicker of worry on Peggy’s face

INT ELLIE’S BEDROOM - ANOTHER EVENING 5

Total disarray A huge case is open Ellie is filling it with
her vinyl records Peggy watches her pack concerned

ELLIE
You sure I can take all of these

PEGGY
I got you hooked on them I
couldn’t deprive you now

Peggy peers into the suitcase filled with vinyl

PEGGY (CONTD)
Do you have enough space Don’t you
need socks

ELLIE
(of course)
Socks

Ellie gets up and heads to a chest of drawers

Peggy turns and takes a picture frame from the bedside table
Ellie’s Mother and Peggy in the late ‘70s They pose outside
the Criterion Restaurant in Piccadilly Circus

Peggy stares at the photo It’s something very precious

PEGGY
This was one of the first times
your Mum and me went to London
God the shops We used to go and
look at all the clothes Libertys
Selfridges Carnaby Street She’d
try everything on The snooty shop
girls knew we couldn’t afford
them They didn’t know we could
copy them

Peggy holds the photo out to Ellie

PEGGY (CONTD)
Take it
Ellie looks at the photo then sighs

ELLIE
I can’t Gran

Ellie smiles but shakes her head

ELLIE (CONTD)
Bring her up when I’m settled We
can have dinner at the Criterion
like in the photo

PEGGY
Oh we didn’t eat there Couldnt
afford to We just took a picture
outside then went to a Wimpy

ELLIE
When I’m a big-time fashion
designer we’ll go Deal

PEGGY
I don’t think Wimpy still exists

ELLIE
You know what I mean

Ellie continues to pack Peggy looks at the picture still in
her hand joy mixed with sadness

PEGGY
I understand how much you want
this It was her dream too But
it’s not everything you imagine
London You have to watch yourself

ELLIE
I know
PEGGY
I want to say it anyway-
ELLIE PEGGY (CONTD)
-There are lots of bad You have to be careful There
guys I’ll be careful are lots of bad people-

PEGGY (CONTD)
Bad apples

She grabs scissors and brandishes them at Peggy with a grin

ELLIE
I’m scrappy I can take them
5A

Ellie smirks and resumes packing Peggy is still worried

PEGGY
I’m just saying London can be a
lot It was too much for your mum
perhaps and she didn’t have
your gift

ELLIE
‘My gift’

PEGGY
She didn’t feel things see
things like you I worry youll get
all overwhelmed again

Ellie’s packing stops She turns to Peggy quietly but firm

ELLIE
It’s not just that I need to do
this for me I want to for her
Maybe it won’t be so bad Maybe up
there I won’t be reminded of her so
much

PEGGY
(not entirely convinced)
Okay

Ellie can’t look at Peggy She goes back to packing

ELLIE
Besides I haven’t even seen Mum in
ages

In the corner of the frame lurks the bedroom mirror Empty

INT ELLIES BEDROOM - MORNING 5A
BEEP-—BEEP-BEEP

Ellie hits off her alarm clock Unplugs it wraps the cord
and shoves it in her suitcase

Ellie’s room has been pillaged of everything she needs for
London Her stuff is stacked by the door

She runs her hands along the wall of the bedroom A sober
moment

As she turns she catches sight of a figure in the mirror Her
mum sitting on the edge of the bed Looking back at Ellie A
mixture of hope and fear in her eyes
ELLIE
(Sotto)
Bye mum Bye

Ellie closes the door and leaves

EXT PEGGY’S HOUSE - THE NEXT DAY

A pretty cottage in a rural street A minicab idles by the
garden gate

Peggy

Ellie

Ellie
moves

Peggy
1970s

Ellie

PEGGY
You’1l call

ELLIE
You know I will

PEGGY
And if it all gets too much in
there you’ll tell me

ELLIE
In the city

shakes her head and taps Ellie’s head
PEGGY
In here Don’t bottle it up Don’t
do that to yourself Don’t do that
to me Okay
nods and smiles
ELLIE

I love you

kisses her on the check and they break apart Ellie
to the minicab leaving Peggy alone by the gate

PEGGY
Ellie

goes after her and puts something in her hand The
photo of Ellie’s mother and Peggy

PEGGY (CONTD)
I want both of us to be there

takes it and kisses her grandmother on the cheek

ELLIE
I won’t let you guys down
PEGGY
You never could

Ellie slips into the back of the taxi She looks at the photo
in her hand and turns to look out the rear window As the
taxi draws away Peggy is no longer standing alone

Ellie’s mother is next to her

Ellie smiles at them and waves Peggy smiles and waves back
It’s difficult for Eloise to see the expression on her
mother’s face as the taxi drives away but before the car
disappears around the corner Eloise can tell that her mother
is neither smiling nor waving Then they are gone

INT TRAIN - DAY 7

SONG ‘DON’T THROW YOUR LOVE AWAY’ by The Searchers

The English countryside speeds by the window bathed in
glorious sunshine Pastoral idyllic and to Ellie really
boring She watches it all fall away

WHOMPH - a tunnel The train plunges into blackness

When it exits the darkness the carriage is suddenly full of
people Urban cityscapes rattle by

INT PADDINGTON STATION CONCOURSE - EVENING 8

Rush hour Unbelievably busy Clamorous sounds

During this sequence we focus only on a wide-eyed Ellie the
frantic melee of the city filling the corners of the frame

She drags her heavy cases commuters cutting through her
path buffeting her off course

INT TAXI RANK - EVENING 9

Ellie slips inside a Hackney Carriage at the front of a long
line of gleaming black taxis

The TAXI DRIVER 60s heaves her cases into the front and
slides back into the driver’s seat He doesn’t turn round so
we only see slices of his face in the rearview mirror She
catches a warm grin on his lips

ELLIE
Charlotte Street please

TAXI DRIVER
My pleasure darling

INT CENTRAL LONDON STREETS - EVENING 10

Ellie beams with joy her eyes dance on the glittering lights
of Piccadilly Her gaze sticks for a second on the exterior
of The Criterion restaurant She smiles filling with warmth

TAXI DRIVER
First time

ELLIE
I visited once with my mum but I
was small It looks so different
now

TAXI DRIVER
It changes fast alright But don’t
worry it’s still the same old
London underneath

ELLIE
Oh good

TAXI DRIVER
What’s brought you down then

ELLIE
I’m studying The London College of
Fashion

TAXI DRIVER
So you’re a model

She catches his eyes in the rearview mirror They are taking
her in Ellie shifts a little uncomfortable

ELLIE
Oh no I design clothes Well I
want to I mean I want to bea
designer

TAXI DRIVER
But you could be a model You got
the legs for it I’m a leg man
myself

Ellie moves her legs behind her bags Says nothing

TAXI DRIVER (CONTD)
So what’s on Charlotte Street

ELLIE
It’s uh student housing

TAXI DRIVER
So it’s all girls in that building
If all the super models are in
Charlotte Street you’ll be seeing
me around and no mistake You
might’ve found your first stalker

His eyes lock on to hers in the rearview Ellie’s eyes look
away and stick on the meter £1920 and rising

ELLIE
Ill get out here

TAXI DRIVER
Still another couple of streets to
go love

ELLIE
I’ve not got enough cash

TAXI DRIVER
I’m sure we could sort something
out sweetheart Plus it’s not good
round here at night for young
girls

ELLIE
I want to go to the shop anyway

TAXI DRIVER
Please yourself

The Driver grumbles and pulls over Ellie hands over the £20
Peggy gave her

ELLIE
Thanks

She drags her bags onto the street The taxi driver’s eyes
follow her as she ducks into the shop

INT CORNER SHOP - EVENING 11

Ellie wheels her cases inside and watches through the door as
the taxi idles Panic begins to creep on her face

SHOP OWNER (0S)
Hello Can I help you

The SHOP OWNER impatiently waits for her to buy something
Ellie picks up a can of Coke and pays for it She moves to he
window the taxi gone Ellie breathes a sigh of relief

EXT CHARLOTTE ST STUDENT HALLS - NIGHT 12

A foreboding brutalist building stark against the period
townhouses around it Ellie drags her cases exhausted from
the effort Up ahead-

A young black man JOHN DRAMEH 18 handsome if a little
awkward He’s standing by the door eating an apple Ellie
passes him and heaves her cases up the stairs

John moves towards her mouth full of apple

JOHN
Hey you want a hand

ELLIE
No I’m okay

A case slips down a step knocking her off balance

JOHN
You don’t look okay

ELLIE
Well I am

Ellie moves quickly inside the building away from John

INT HALLS CORRIDOR - NIGHT 13

Strip lighting and blue linoleum floors This place just
looks like it smells of bleach Ellie sweaty and frazzled
batters her cases off her shins as she struggles along

A head pops out from one of the doors It belongs to JOCASTA
19 tall and slender imposingly beautiful achingly cool
She speaks at 200 MPH and rarely smiles She’s overdressed in
black designer couture but has the attitude to pull it off

JOCASTA
You Eloise

ELLIE
Yeah

JOCASTA

You look like an Eloise

ELLIE
Well Ellie

Jocasta backs into the doorway and points to a printed sheet
pinned to the door ‘Jocasta Thomsen and Eloise Turner’
Jocasta’s surname is crossed out with black marker

JOCASTA
I’m Jocasta

ELLIE
Did they spell your surname wrong
or something

JOCASTA
No I decided to drop it because I
think it’s more singular to be
known only by your Christian name
So famous in your work that you can
literally just go by ‘Kylie’

ELLIE
‘Minogue’

JOCASTA
‘Jenner’ Okay bad example But
how many Jocastas do you know

ELLIE
None

JOCASTA
Exactly babes

Jocasta holds open the door and Ellie heads into-

INT DORM BEDROOM - NIGHT 14

A room far too small for two people This place is tiny
Dank The window looks out to a brick wall Ellie enters
trying very hard to not look disheartened

Jocasta’s stuff is strewn across the ‘prime’ bed - the one
that doesn’t get battered every time the door opens

JOCASTA
You don’t mind that I snagged the
one by the window do you

ELLIE
(faint)
No
Jocasta pours red wine into a glass and thrusts it into
Ellie’s hand as she is taking off her coat

JOCASTA
If we don’t end up throttling each other
we could maybe talk about switching next
term

She smiles at Ellie It’s disarmingly charming

JOCASTA (CONTD)
So where are you from

ELLIE
Redruth

Jocasta looks at Ellie lost

JOCASTA
I’m sorry

ELLIE
You know Cornwall in the
countryside

JOCASTA
I heard you babes I’m just sorry

ELLIE
Uh So what about you

JOCASTA
Manchester but I spent my gap year
down here interning at an atelier
in Saville Row

Ellie stares at Jocasta totally intimidated

ELLIE
Wow I’ve just been in Redruth
Making my own clothes

JOCASTA
I had a hunch you made that This
is a Bouchra Jarrar Before she
sold out and moved to Lanvin
Smoke

ELLIE
Uh no is it allowed in here

Jocasta leans in smiles conspiratorially

JOCASTA
I took the batteries out of the
alarm I guess I can go outside if
you really have a problem with it

ELLIE

(lying)
No it’s fine

JOCASTA
I tried vaping I think that just
makes you so much more of a cunt

ELLIE
(quietly)
Yeah totally

Jocasta blows smoke toward the window Her eyes land on
Ellie’s untouched wine Ellie feels her glare and sips some

JOCASTA
What does your dad do

ELLIE
I don’t know him

JOCASTA
What about your mum

ELLIE
My mother’s dead

JOCASTA
I knew we’d find some common
ground eventually I was only
fifteen when she died You

ELLIE
Um seven

JOCASTA
Wow that is young Though I guess
maybe it’s easier at that age

JOCASTA (CONTD)
Not a competition though is it

Ellie looks at Jocasta it isn’t
Sounds filter in from the corridor outside More arrivals

JOCASTA (CONTD)
Ooh Fresh blood

Jocasta rushes for them Ellie is alone in the room lost

INT STUDENT HALLS KITCHEN - NIGHT 15
Ellie peers into the kitchen to see Jocasta holding court

Jocasta already has THREE other STUDENTS in orbit around her
All of them are overdressed modern silhouettes in black
very high fashion They are CAMI 22 ASHLEY 19 LARA 18

LARA
Is that a bloody Bouchra Jarrar

JOCASTA
Good eye It’s from before she sold
out and moved to Lanvin obviously

Laughter canters around the group

JOCASTA (CONTD)
Oh this is my roomie Eloise

The crowd turn to her sizing her up

JOCASTA (CONTD)
She literally made the outfit she’s
wearing How amazing is that All
of us turn up in our Sunday best
she’s rocking her own design I’m
thinking we should call her brass
balls Ellie

More laughter but Ellie isn’t sure if it’s at her expense

ASHLEY
What are we going to call you

JOCASTA
By tomorrow morning you shall know
me only as Hurricane Jocasta

CAMI
So you guys know each other from
before

JOCASTA

Oh we go way back what is it now
Fifteen minutes

ELLIE
Something like that

JOCASTA
We’re in the dead mums club

The room is suddenly awkward

JOCASTA (CONTD)
Fuck Leukemia amirite

LARA
That is awful

JOCASTA
It’s pretty shit not going to lie
But I really feel it fuels my work

ASHLEY
What happened to your mum

Ellie looks at the others she flushes a little

ELLIE
Uh well my mum wasn’t well
mentally She killed herself

Silence everyone’s faces have flooded with empathy except
Jocasta who inexplicably looks pissed off

ASHLEY
I’m sorry I shouldn’t have asked

ELLIE
It was a long time ago

LARA
You are like so brave

CAMT
So brave Christ

JOCASTA
Yeah I had a great uncle commit
suicide Hung himself So I know
exactly what it’s like

Ellie trying to get out of the conversation opens the
fridge to put her can of Coke in it Inside is A mini Whole
Foods emporium All with ‘Jocasta’ monogrammed across them

JOCASTA (CONTD)
First rodeo Els Got to mark your
territory babes
15A

Jocasta grabs a sharpie from the counter writes the name
‘ELLIE’ on the Coke and puts it inside Ellie watches with
trepidation as Jocasta grabs a bottle of Jagermeister

JOCASTA (CONTD)
Time to break out the big guns
lets really get on this bitch
Jocasta pours five shots of Jager into some mugs
CAMI
Do we really want to be hungover on
our first day
JOCASTA
Hush That’s future Cami talking
And you know what Fuck her We
have to live in the now So hoes-
Jocasta downs hers and gestures that the others do the same

JOCASTA (CONTD)
-to Soho

They all toast ‘To Soho’ Ellie late and quietly

EXT SOHO STREET - NIGHT 15A

The group of freshers walk down a busy Soho street - Ellie
lagging a little behind

They approach The Toucan

INT THE TOUCAN - NIGHT 16

Music if you can call it that blares Some awful Irish folk-
cum-techno Very loud utterly unbearable

Ellie is in a packed Irish bar it’s teaming with FRESHERS
and some angry REGULARS Despite the ear bleeding music
Jocasta is still talking Queen of the Freshers

JOCASTA
I dated an Irish guy twice the
same guy but two times and he

was Irish

We focus on Ellie watching from the sidelines Bored and a
little horrified that these are the people she’s living with

Across the bar a guy catches her eyes - John the weird apple
eater from outside halls He smiles mimes You want a drink
She shakes her head Shows she has one already
A DRUNK BRO leans over to Jocasta and whispers in her ear
DRUNK BRO
Hey My dick just died Can I bury
it in your ass-

Jocasta pushes him away

JOCASTA
No Absolutely not

Jocasta turns and points to Ellie
JOCASTA(CONTD) (CONTD)
Try that line on Ellie I bet she’s
complete filth once you get a few
shots inside her

Everyone laughs The Bro grins at Ellie but she escapes to-

INT TOUCAN BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS 17

Ellie walks down the steps into a less crowded basement bar
She spots the sign for the LADIES and heads towards it

Ellie’s eyes glance to a mirror next to the door Just behind
her is a LEERING MAN mid 30s a little ‘off’ Ellie can
clearly see in the mirror that he is staring at her

There’s something weird about him He’s dressed as if he’s
from some time 50 years ago

Ellie turns to look at him -

He’s not there She just spots the regulars and the IRISH
BARMAID (Carol)

Ellie is a little rattled She heads to the bathroom

INT TOUCAN BATHROOM STALL - MOMENTS LATER 18

Ellie hides in the stall savouring the moment of being
alone A notice catches her eye

“HATE DRUNK PEOPLE BE A BARTENDER STAFF WANTED”

After a beat she hears the door swing open

JOCASTA
It’s just a bit shit

Ellie listens in as they head into the stall next to her We
hear unmistakable sniffing in-between their lines

JOCASTA (CONTD)
I think she’s a real code beige
I’m getting born-again Christian
vibes off of her

CAMI
Who country mouse

Ellie looks at the door of the stall her heart sinking

JOCASTA
She comes to the first day at LCF
wearing clothes she made
Fuckssake

They cackle

ASHLEY
That was a bit much

JOCASTA
And then she kept bringing up her
mum’s suicide Who uses that for
attention

ASHLEY
Yeah that was a little weird

JOCASTA
She’s a lot fucking weird Id
lay bets on her slashing her wrists
before Christmas
We hear astonished gasps and cackles Then they leave Ellie
stays in the stall Angry hurt
SCENE 19 OMITTED

EXT DEAN STREET SOHO - NIGHT 20
Soho is heaving with people - loud and brassy
JOCASTA

Cmon We’ve got another three pubs
to hit before the clubs open

Ellie lags behind She passes a dirty phone box Taped inside
the glass are flyer cards advertising prostitutes
One card reads ‘EVERY MANS DREAM BLONDE’
Then through the glass across the street from her she spots
an open doorway a figure darkens it A TALL MAN he too
looks like he’s in fashions from 50 years ago as he’s
dressed in a bowler hat and three piece suit
Above him a handwritten sign on the door says

“MODELS”
Ellie peers around the phone box to get a better look
The figure is gone Ellie blinks
A neon arrow points up the stairs Ellie peers in intrigued
The other freshers are getting farther and farther away
Ellie is still looking at the door
Feet appear on the stairs and A SILVER HAIRED GENTLEMAN
descends He is in his 70s his clothes are old but
expensive his pale hair catches the neon light He stands at

the bottom of the stairs and rights his clothes

Ellie stares at him He locks eyes with her He has a
striking gaunt face She looks down but he stares on

When her eyes flick back to him He winks at her Then heads
off carving a path through the crowds like someone who was
once important

Ellie turns back to the Freshers - spots them on the next
block She could run to catch up with them She could

She doesn’t Ellie turns and heads away from them bumped and
buffeted into the drunken crowd

SONG ‘STARSTRUCK’ by The Kinks

Over Ellie walking away at a brisk pace we hear the sounds
of the sixties Of the London she dreams it still was

THE KINKS
Baby you dont know what youre
saying Because youre a victim of
bright city lights

INT DORM BEDROOM - NIGHT 21

Ellie is in bed listening to her headphones lost in her own
world For the first time in London she looks comfortable

THE KINKS
‘Cause youre starstruck baby
starstruck taken in by the lights

BAM The door swings open smashes into the bottom of her bed
frame Light from the hallway spills into the room as Jocasta
and the Bro careen in making out hands all over each other

Ellie sits up in bed to remind Jocasta that she’s in here
Jocasta doesn’t notice or more accurately doesn’t give a
fuck She pushes Bro onto her bed rips off her top

INT STUDENT HALLS KITCHEN - NIGHT 22

Pandemonium A party is in full swing Fifteen-odd FRESHERS
all blind drunk and wittering on John is among them sipping
on a can of Coke

Ellie enters wrapped in her duvet headphones still in She
finds a spot on the couch and sits Her eyes close the music
carrying her away when-

Someone pulls out her headphones

She opens her eyes to see some DRUNK ARSEHOLE a foot from her
face holding her ear buds He grins

DRUNK ARSEHOLE
What are you listening to

ELLIE
Well nothing now

The Arsehole puts the buds in his ears Ellie stares daggers
at him His grin changes to confused disgust

DRUNK ARSEHOLE
You actually listen to this granny
shit How old are you

JOHN
You can fucking talk Didn’t you
put that techno Riverdance shit on
in the Toucan

Drunk Arsehole’s face crinkles with embarrassment He gives
the headphones back to Ellie and John moves over next to her

JOHN (CONTD)
Don’t pay any attention to him
I’m John by the way

ELLIE
Ellie

He smiles then some cog turns in his brain He looks to the
can of Coke he’s holding “ELLIE” is written on the side

JOHN
Shit This is your can isn’t it
Sorry

He moves to hand it back to her

ELLIE
Have it

Ellie puts her headphones back in John stands there for an
awkward beat before turning to the others

She turns her music up drowns them out She sinks on the
sofa neck drooping at an uncomfortable angle Her eyes close-
INT STUDENT HALLS KITCHEN - MORNING 23
Ellie is asleep in the same position She wakes with a start
Nobody else is here Checks the time on her phone - FUCK

EXT LONDON COLLEGE OF FASHION - DAY 24

people It’s all not too much

ELLIE

PEGGY (0S)

Ellie’s eyes land on the notice board beside her it’s
crammed with index cards except for one small blank space in
the middle Something is missing Ellie looks down at her
feet spots the card she lifts it reads it

Well it’s 8 Goodge Place Press the
buzzer for Collins

EXT APARTMENT BUILDING - GOODGE PLACE - LATER 27

Ellie stands outside a Victorian mansion block It has a
faded grandeur about it She rings the doorbell We hear a
voice call out

MS COLLINS (0S)
Just coming dearie

The door opens on a latch Ms Collins a hard-faced
bespectacled woman in her mid-70s opens the door

ELLIE
Ms Collins We spoke on the phone

INT HALLWAY - APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY 28

Ms Collins leads Ellie up the stairs It’s dark even in the
day so the elderly landlady switches on a timer light

MS COLLINS
Room’s on the top floor Have a few
rules Don’t take smokers

ELLIE
I don’t smoke

MS COLLINS
No male visitors after 8 o’clock

ELLIE

ELLIE

Ms Collins frowns at Ellie
ELLIE (CONTD)

I don’t do nighttime laundry I
do do laundry I am very clean

MS COLLINS
Good

INT THE BEDROOM - DAY 29

Ms Collins opens the door Ellie steps inside This place is
nothing to write home about Just a bed a nice old vanity
mirror tiny kitchenette through an alcove tiny bathroom
off But Ellie is sold

MS COLLINS
It’s too old fashioned for some But I
won’t do nothing to it so if you don’t
like it find somewhere else

ELLIE
It’s perfect I love it

Ms Collins stays by the door and gives a very perfunctory
tour from the hallway

MS COLLINS
Bed kitchenette bathroom You
won’t have to worry about this
until the summer but you have to
keep the plugs in because all the
smells rise up

Ellie is still captivated by the room and its view

ELLIE
How long have you been here

MS COLLINS
A long time Used to work here
cleaning and such back when round
here was a bad spot Got it for
buttons off the old owner

ELLIE
It must be worth a lot now

MS COLLINS
I could never sell it Too many
memories

ELLIE
Yeah If I could live any place and
anytime I would pick London here
in the sixties It must have felt
like the centre of the universe

Ms Collins is unmoved keen to press on

MS COLLINS
You know what a landline is Some
of your lot don’t

ELLIE
Of course

Ms Collins points to a rotary phone on the bedside table

MS COLLINS
Don’t get too excited it only
makes emergency calls Oh and I
hope you like garlic

ELLIE
Yeah

MS COLLINS
There’s a French bistro next door
and pretty soon you won’t be able
to smell anything else

INT GROUND FLOOR FLAT - DAY 30

Ellie sits in a comfy chair in Ms Collins’ musty but well
appointed flat The walls are adorned with trinkets and
pictures similar to Peggy’s home

MS COLLINS
So when are you looking to move in

ELLIE
As soon as possible

Ms Collins brings over a mug

MS COLLINS
Youre not in trouble or anything

ELLIE
No I just need an escape

MS COLLINS
Don’t we all dearie What’s your
line of work

ELLIE
Oh I’m a student but I have a
loan and a bursary

Ms Collins seems satisfied

MS COLLINS
What do you study

ELLIE
Fashion

MS COLLINS
Oh interesting

ELLIE
Yeah My gran is a seamstress and
my mother is was in the industry
too So I know how tough it can be
but I’m determined

MS COLLINS
And you’re sure you’ll be able to
make the rent

ELLIE
I can make it work yes

MS COLLINS
Well I do ask for a little more
than your average landlady I’1l
need two months rent in advance and
another two months deposit

Ellie mentally does the math she looks a little worried

ELLIE
Okay

Ms Collins leans forward and gets serious
MS COLLINS
I’ve had a few people just take off
in the middle of the night that’s
why

Ellie also leans forward

ELLIE
Ms Collins I would never do that

INT STUDENT HALLS - COMMUNAL AREA - NIGHT

Ellie takes off in middle of the night She lugs her bags
through the communal area which is seemingly empty

INT ELLIE’S NEW BEDROOM - NIGHT 32

We see Ellie at peace alone unpacking in her new bedroom
While it’s not quite home it’s close enough She settles on
her bed for a beat and finally exhales The photograph of her
mother is on the bedside table pride of place

Ellie lifts it stares at her mum - she’s in her early 20s
Confident and ambitious Her eyes sparkle with life With
hope Ellie runs her finger over the image of her mother
invoking her as she did before

But when she looks expectantly around the room
There is no vision of her mother no ghost Ellie is alone
For a second it’s almost overwhelming Ellie sets the

photograph back down

She changes into a comfy hoodie and PJs Sets up her Crosley
player Puts on some vinyl

She runs her hands along the warped musty walls getting a
feel for her new home her new private domain

She lies back and stares at black vinyl spinning

SONG ‘YOURE MY WORLD’ by Cilla Black

Tricolor neon seeps in from the French restaurant sign next
door and flashes in her dark bedroom

Red white blue Red white blue-

Ellie pulls the bedsheets over her head to dampen the neon
The light gets through Red white blue-

Red red red

Red red red-

INT TUNNEL - NIGHT 33
Red red red
Ellie pulls the bed sheet off her face to find that-

She’s no longer in bed

Ellie glances around the strange place She’s in a tunnel

The amber glow of streetlights glint from the far end Ellie
stands and still in her PJs and hoodie heads for the bright
lights Walking over the cobbles until it opens onto-

EXT MAYFAIR STREET (1960S) - NIGHT 34

London of the 1960s Some buildings are the same but the
changes are noticeable the signage the lighting the cars
the fashions

Right in front of Ellie is the entrance to a glamorous
nightclub the famous ‘Café de Paris’ She is drawn towards
the front door chic men and women are queued up outside

Ellie drifts inexorably towards the entrance Two well
dressed BOUNCERS spot her and exchange a look One smiles and
makes room for her to walk straight into-

INT CAFE DE PARIS FOYER - NIGHT 35

Sumptuous the decor drips money Ellie stands in the middle
of its stunning foyer In her PJs The posh cloakroom
attendant doesn’t seem to mind

CLOAKROOM ATTENDANT
May I take your cloak madame

Ellie looks at her stained hoodie

ELLIE
My cloak Uh yeah

She unzips her hoodie and hands it to the Attendant As she
does she clocks a full length mirror to her side Ellie
stares in it Bewildered

Her reflection is SANDIE early 20s stunning confident and
ambitious She’s dressed to the nines There’s a radiance to
her everyone is drawn to it None more so than Ellie

Ellie walks towards the mirror testing the reflection
unable to believe that she could ever look like Sandie not
even in her wildest dreams

Sandie has a tumbling set of platinum curls (the classic
Brigitte Bardot ‘choucroute’ haircut of the time) that offset
her gorgeous face Her eyes sparkle back at Ellie

We push into the mirror and observe Sandie in the reflection

CLOAKROOM ATTENDANT (0S)
Are we with a gentleman this
evening

Sandie turns as one of the bouncers approaches And as we
pull out from the mirror perspectives magically shift

Now Sandie stands in the lobby and Ellie is in the
reflection It’s as if Ellie is inhabiting Sandie’s body

SANDIE
We are not

CLOAKROOM ATTENDANT
So Madame is alone

Sandie smiles her charm has an edge of defiance

SANDIE
I am

CLOAKROOM ATTENDANT
Very good

The Cloakroom Attendant shows Sandie to the stairs she
descends into-

INT CAFE DE PARIS CLUB - NIGHT 36

All eyes are on Sandie as she descends a mirrored staircase
She is the belle of the ball

In the reflection of the mirrors we see Ellie (still in her
PJs) going down with her she too is looking at Sandie

On stage is CILLA BLACK herself singing the very song that
Ellie was playing on vinyl in her room

Sandie walks confidently onto the nightclub floor and into
the crowd Music swells as she parts the sea of rich club-
goers attracting attention from male and female patrons

She heads to a beautiful bar Before she makes it a rotund
balding man in his forties stands in her way He’s well
dressed but oozes sweat and sleaze We’1l call him CUBBY

CUBBY
Hello You’re a gorgeous creature
What’s your name

SANDIE
Sandie

Cubby gestures towards a dark booth peopled with other
similarly shifty men in dark suits

CUBBY
Care to join my friends and I
Sandie

SANDIE
Thank you but I’m here to meet the
owner

CUBBY

I am the owner
Cubby grins Sandie looks at him wry disbelief

SANDIE
I doubt that

CUBBY
I’m whatever you want me to be
Sandie

She brushes off Cubby’s affections as Cilla Black finishes
her song to applause from the crowd

Sandie rocks up at a bar with a mirrored back we see Ellie
watching in the reflection an observer in a glacial
dimension

As Sandie waits for service she sees JACK Movie star
handsome with slicked back hair He’s perfectly dressed
tiepin pocket-square He sips a drink eyes locked onto her

Sandie smiles for just long enough then looks away

In the mirror we can see Ellie as Sandie’s reflection still
watching all of this with awe The bartender approaches

BARTENDER
What’s your poison miss

SANDIE
I’m not here to drink actually I
want to speak to the owner

BARTENDER
Owner’s not in tonight What do you
want to speak to them about

SANDIE
I want to be your new headline act

BARTENDER

Where have you played before
SANDIE

Nowhere
BARTENDER

Who starts at the Café de Paris
SANDIE

Me

The Bartender smiles

BARTENDER

I can take your name if you want
but maybe you should speak to Jack
in the meantime

SANDIE
Jack

The bartender points to him now standing next to Cilla Black
making small talk

BARTENDER
Over there the guy standing by
Cilla Black He manages a lot of
girls

Sandie’s eyes twinkle She makes her way over to Jack and
slides in next to him She looks up at him it’s magnetic
He turns away from Cilla and looks to Sandie with a smile

JACK
Why hello there

SANDIE
The bartender said I should get to
know the handsome fella standing
next to Cilla Black

JACK
You should And you are

SANDIE
The next Cilla Black

Jack likes this Takes her in

JACK
Are you now Well you know she
started as a coat check girl You
willing to work your way up

SANDIE
Of course

JACK
What can I get you to drink

SANDIE
It’s Sandie And Id love a Vesper

Jack orders her a cocktail looks her up and down

JACK
So what do you do Sandie

SANDIE
Well I sing of course

JACK
How is your dancing

SANDIE
Care for a demonstration

A new song starts up in the club and Sandie pulls Jack onto
the dance floor

SONG ‘WADE IN THE WATER’ by The Graham Bond Organisation
Sandie proceeds to tear up the dance floor Everyone is
looking at her Jack watches appreciatively and then joins
her in the dance The two cut a rug and look good doing it
At a key moment in the choreography Sandie becomes Ellie for

a magical moment also now done up to the nines and with the
same platinum Bardot curls

The dance ends with Sandie back to normal Ellie in the
reflection Jack seems bowled over

SANDIE (CONTD)
Your thoughts

Jack slips a hand around Sandie’s waist and waltzes with her

JACK
Youre already a star

She grins
JACK (CONTD)
But you could be an old lady before

you get on stage here

Sandie’s face drops a little

JACK (CONTD)
How about I get you a gig somewhere
this week

SANDIE
You could do that

JACK
I could indeed But first let me
get your drink

Jack goes back to the bar Cubby pounces on her once again

CUBBY
Do I get a dance now

SANDIE
‘fraid not

CUBBY
Oh you looked up for it just then

SANDIE
I’m just waiting for my friend Jack
to get my drink

CUBBY
Well I’m sure Jack won’t mind

SANDIE
I mind

Cubby turns nasty Grabbing Sandie’s arm
CUBBY
Don’t pretend you don’t love the
attention

Jack returns with the Vesper

JACK
This man bothering you

Before Sandie can answer Cubby weighs in
CUBBY
I was only asking our friend Sandie

for a dance

JACK
Her card is full right now

In one smooth move Jack waltzes her away from Cubby

CUBBY
Alright old chap Don’t hog her all
night

JACK

You’re the hog old chap
Sandie can’t believe how cheeky Jack is Cubby seethes

CUBBY
Now don’t be a cunt about it You
can keep your little whore-

JACK
What did you call the lady

CUBBY
She’s a slut mate look at her-

BOOM Jack punches Cubby out Lightning quick Cubby reels
back his hands ball into fists before he can strike back -
BANG Jack hits him again knocks him down

It’s all so sudden and shocking We can see the flush of
emotions on Sandie’s face she’s both scared and thrilled

In a nearby mirror we can see that Ellie feels the same

There’s commotion as bouncers swarm the dance floor Jack
pulls Sandie out of the fray and into-

INT CLUB PHONE BOOTH - CONTINUOUS 37

Plush mirrored on three sides The commotion rages outside
Jack and Sandie are suddenly in very close proximity Sandie
looks into Jack’s deep blue eyes They kiss

In the mirror we see Sandie look into her own reflection and
see Ellie staring back at her We see the ecstasy on Sandie’s
face as Jack roughly kisses her We see the stunned
expression on Ellie’s face as Jack bites at their neck

The bouncers close in They are found They run up the stairs
laughing like kids

EXT CAFE DE PARIS - NIGHT 38
Suddenly in a rush we are back on the street where we

started Jack gesturing to a Triumph Spitfire In the
background the lights of Piccadilly Circus twinkle

JACK
Least I can do is drive you home

SANDIE
What’s the most

Jack grins

SANDIE (CONTD)
Do you know Goodge Street

JACK
Well

SANDIE
I’m on Goodge Place Number 8

39 EXT PICCADILLY CIRCUS (1960S) - NIGHT 39

Buzzing and beautiful Neon glows in the night mirrored on
Jacks windshield dancing in Sandie’s eyes In the
reflection of Jack’s window we can see Ellie on the other
side looking on awed by the vintage glamor

JACK
Being here with all these lights
shining on you It’s the closest
most people ever get to being on
stage to their dreams

SANDIE
Not me

JACK
Not you I can see you want it

SANDIE
More than anything

JACK
This is just a taste of things to
come Sandie

40 EXT APARTMENT BUILDING - GOODGE PLACE (1960S) - NIGHT 40
Jack pulls up outside a Victorian mansion block on Goodge
Place the same as Ellie’s but in 1965 Jack escorts her to

their door

JACK
So I’ll see you again

SANDIE
I hope so

JACK
Tomorrow 8pm

There are sparks between her and Jack

SANDIE
Youknow where to find me

INT SANDIE’S BEDROOM (1960S) - NIGHT 41

Sandie takes off her make-up in the vanity mirror She looks
very young under the foundation Pinned to the mirror are
some of her headshots We pull back to see Ellie sitting at
the mirror watching Sandie in the reflection

Sandie gets up and moves over to the bed Ellie watches her
As Sandie drops off to sleep Ellie stands over her watching
Suddenly compelled she reaches out to touch Sandie’s arm As
she does she-

INT ELLIES ROOM (MODERN DAY) - EARLY MORNING 42
Wakes up

Ellie is back in her PJs in her normal bedroom modern day
She almost looks disappointed

INT CLASSROOM - LONDON COLLEGE OF FASHION - DAY 43

A workshop-like classroom A mix of STUDENTS sit sewing at
machines and easels Amid all the activity is -

Ellie beautifully put together today intensely focused on a
fashion illustration of the same ‘60s dress that Sandie wore
in last night’s dream The face of the woman she sketches
also looks very much like Sandie

JOHN (0S)
Self portrait is it

Ellie turns to see John looking over her shoulder She smiles
at his question and says softly almost to herself

ELLIE
No Just someone I know

JOHN

She looks pretty cool
ELLIE

She is
JOHN

So you like this retro style

ELLIE
Yeah there’s something about the
sixties that just speaks to me

Jocasta wanders over annoyed by the attention Ellie is
getting When she sees the sketch she can’t help but be
impressed Then her eyes catch something a mark on Ellie’s
neck Right where Jack was kissing Sandie

JOCASTA
This is very retro The hickey
Very daring

Ellie looks confused as Jocasta points at her neck She can
feel the eyes of the class suddenly upon her

John working on his own designs can’t help but overhear
JOCASTA (CONTD)
So what did you get up to last
night in Soho Out with some guy
Or girl
Ellie pulls her sweater up embarrassed Jocasta grins
JOCASTA (CONTD)
No judgements from me Live ya best life
(sotto)
You should get some arnica on that

INT COLLEGE BATHROOM - LONDON COLLEGE OF FASHION - DAY 44

And then just for a flash we see excitement in her eyes

EXT LONDON COLLEGE OF FASHION - DAY 45

SONG ‘IVE GOT MY MIND SET ON YOU’ by James Ray

Ellie leaves college headphones in a smirk on her lips
John chases after her a can of Coke in his hand

JOHN

John taps her on the shoulder She stops pulls out a bud
JOHN (CONTD)
I really liked what you were

drawing today

ELLIE
Thanks

He hands her a can of Coke with ‘SORRY’ written on it

ELLIE (CONTD)
You didn’t have to

JOHN
Least I could do

ELLIE
What’s the most

John is a little taken aback Ellie instantly reddens
ELLIE (CONTD)

I don’t know why I said that I
thought it would sound cool

JOHN
Uh yeah Do you have any plans
tonight

ELLIE

I kinda do actually

John looks a little disappointed as Ellie smiles to herself

INT HALLWAY - APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT 47
Ellie pads to the front door She opens it to find-

Jack at the door all dressed up charming as ever Behind
him Goodge Place is clearly from the mid-’60s

JACK
Sorry I’m a little late

When we cut back to Ellie Sandie stands in her place She is
ready to go out all made up and wearing a white Mackintosh
coat over a gorgeous dress She’s also pretty pissed off

SANDIE
A little doesn’t quite cover it

JACK
I’ve a feeling you’ll forgive me

EXT THE RIALTO (1960S) - NIGHT 48

Jack and Sandie pull up in his Triumph outside a Soho
nightclub on a side street Sandie stares at the ornate stone
‘R’ that’s above the awning that reads ‘RIALTO’ She peers
through the glass the foyer is dark and empty

SANDIE
It’s closed

JACK
Not for you

Jack opens the door and enters-—

INT THE RIALTO (1960S) - NIGHT 49

After hours the club is deserted spooky even There’s a
bar some plush booths at the back and seating for 100 in
front of a small stage with velvet curtains

What’s going on

CLUB OWNER (0S)
An audition

She jumps and turns to CLUB OWNER well dressed older He
stands up in the second row now visible to Sandie She looks
at Jack he flashes that killer smile

MOMENTS LATER

The curtains pull back to reveal Sandie on stage in a
spotlight Jack and the Club Owner sit in the second row

CLUB OWNER (CONTD)
Alright knock us dead

SANDIE

(a-cappella)
When youre alone and life is
Making you lonely you can always
go downtown When youve got
worries all the noise and the
hurry seems to help I know
downtown

Jack and the Club Owner watch on entranced as Sandie sings
‘Downtown’ by Petula Clark We pan from them to-

Sandie commanding the stage her voice hauntingly beautiful
We pan back to see-

Ellie sitting in the front row of the audience in her PJs
before the Club Owner and Jack (who cannot see her)

Ellie stands and walks towards the singing Sandie utterly
drawn to her She stops at the foot of the stage entranced

Sandie finishes Ellie continues staring at her beguiling
figure Applause from Jack shatters the silence

CLUB OWNER
So She can sing

Ellie watches as Sandie walks into the blackness of the wings-

EXT THE RIALTO (1960S) - MOMENTS LATER 50

And emerges from the blackness of the Rialto entrance into
the street Street cleaners begin their graveyard shift in
the near-empty streets

Sandie is now walking together with Jack they are giddy and
excited Ellie follows close behind

SANDIE
I can’t fucking believe it

JACK

SANDIE
I can’t wait to get back on there-

JACK
It’s no Café de Paris-

SANDIE
It’s perfect Jack Thank you

start somewhere

JACK
Anything else you need

SANDIE

She grins playfully Jack pulls her close smiles down at
her They kiss

The camera whirls around them wraps them in the darkness of
the street as they embrace In a blink of an eye we are in-
INT SANDIES BEDROOM (1960S) - CONTINUOUS 51

Sandie breaks off from the kiss She and Jack are now
magically in her bedroom still in an embrace

SANDIE
As long as you’re in this for the
long run

JACK

Jack and Sandie fall onto the bed and into shadow We reveal
in the background Ellie watching an unwitting voyeur She
cannot tear her eyes away

INT ELLIES BEDROOM (NOW) - NIGHT 52

Ellie wakes with a start She is sitting up in the very bed
that she dreamt Jack and Sandie were just lying on

She lies back down tries to get back to sleep

INT HAIR SALON - DAY 53

Sandie’s head But-

The chair swivels to reveal Ellie

Sandie styled like the ‘Bardot’ choucroute She looks in the

mirror admiring her new look then beams at the stylist

INT CLASSROOM - LONDON COLLEGE OF FASHION - DAY 55

MS TOBIN
It’s ambitious Ill give you that
But I’m not sure this vintage
fabric will behave

Ellie is standing by a larger and more detailed version of
her drawing of Sandie’s dress

She’s drawn the dress from several angles Sandie too The
detail is stunning Fabric swatches are pinned all over the
board Ms Tobin is standing next to Ellie running her hand
over the chosen fabrics

MS TOBIN (CONTD)
It’s going to be tricky to work
with Best to use something modern-

ELLIE
No This is exactly what it needs
something radiant but not too
structured

MS TOBIN
Okay go on

ELLIE
It needs to meld flow like her
how it drapes on her arms gathers
at her sides

MS TOBIN
Her You imagine the wearer when
you are designing

Ellie can feel the eyes of the class on her now

ELLIE
Yes It’s just when you see
someone in it when I imagine it
She’s wearing the dress the dress
isn’t wearing her

Ms Tobin looks at Ellie really impressed
MS TOBIN
I hope you were all listening to

that

Ellie looks round all the eyes of her classmates are on her
They look a little awed Jocasta whispers under her breath

JOCASTA
Was it something about the sixties

Ellie kind of loves the attention

MS TOBIN
Excellent Ellie And I like the hair
ELLIE
Thank you
INT VINTAGE CLOTHES SHOP - DAY 56

SHOP ASSISTANT
It really suits you

A female Shop Assistant looks on as Ellie tries on a vintage
white Mackintosh in a second hand store in Soho The outfit
has unmistakable echoes of the one Sandie wore to the Rialto

ELLIE
It does doesn’t it Everything was
just so well made back then

SHOP ASSISTANT
We have a BIBA dress in the back
1967 immaculate condition you
should try that one too

The assistant heads off to get it and Ellie steps closer to
the cheval mirror to check herself out But then she sees-

A detail of the building across the street It’s the ornate

stone ‘R’ that was above the awning of the Rialto Ellie
stares at it dumbstruck

EXT VINTAGE CLOTHES SHOP - MOMENTS LATER 57
Ellie in a trance walks into the street and stares at what
was once the club It’s now one of the many ‘spa’ massage

parlors in Soho The building has changed but the stone ‘R’

is undeniably the same one she saw in her dream last night

SHOP ASSISTANT
Excuse me

The assistant has followed her into the street

SHOP ASSISTANT (CONTD)
Are you going to pay for that

Yes Yeah Sorry

A BARTENDER is serving the few customers present

ELLIE

As Ellie moves over towards the seat the GENTLEMAN who was
talking to Carol looks round at her and catches her eye

Ellie’s face ripples with recognition it is the SILVER
HAIRED GENTLEMAN from her first night in London He stares at
her She shifts uncomfortably Carol reappears

CAROL (CONTD)
So what shifts can you do

knocked down The Silver Haired Gentleman smiles

Ms Collins looks at her for a beat then realises
MS COLLINS

So it is Look at that You’ve
changed your hair

ELLIE
Yes I wanted to go for something
different a bit sixties

MS COLLINS
You play a lot of that music

ELLIE

Ellie opens her eyes She’s now in the audience of the
Rialto still in her PJs and sleep clothes The club is full
but she can only see the SILHOUETTES of the patrons clapping
in time with the OOMPAH RHYTHM

The curtains pull back and a female silhouette is on stage
There are cheers as a spotlight switches on to reveal-

A half naked burlesque performer who is NOT Sandie She has

marionette strings on her arms that disappear up into the
rafters She lip syncs ‘Puppet On A String’

SONG ‘PUPPET ON A STRING’ by Sandie Shaw

MARIONETTE SINGER
I wonder if one day that youll say
that you care If you say you love
me madly Ill gladly be there
Like a puppet on a string

Ellie is struck with disappointment Her eyes scan around for
Sandie At the bar Jack nudges his neighbour and points on
stage Ellie follows his line to see-

DANCERS flanking the main ‘singer’ on stage They too wear
marionette strings and are even less clothed The crowd
roars There’s something primal in the cheers

Ellie focuses on the stage and her breath catches Sandie
appears One of the back-up dancers She has a painted-on
smile as she performs Ellie sinks a little

Sandie and the other dancers sway a risqué move causes
another cheer Ellie turns to see that the crowd is all men
creepy and leering Wolf whistles cut through the music

She turns back to the show to see Sandie blow a kiss to a
leering guy in the audience This prompts Ellie to leave

She stands and struggles through the leering crowd Ellie
spots the Club Owner sitting in a booth pointing out Sandie
to some rich looking businessmen

She moves quicker heading for the exit She closes in on
Jack at the bar He’s drinking with - is that - Cubby the
nasty piece of work from Café de Paris

Ellie storms out of the venue the OOMPAH RHYTHM and clapping
ring in her head She heads to the exit but instead of
escaping into the street she finds herself in-

INT SANDIES DRESSING ROOM - LATER 65

Ellie is suddenly alone with Sandie Who looks at herself in
a tatty mirror her headshot pinned to it The beautiful
excited young Sandie stares out from the BandW photograph

Sandie scrapes off her thick make-up We can now see that
time has passed between these dreams Sandie is a little
older now drawn and thinner in the face

She lights a cigarette and takes a long draw staring at
herself in the mirror as she exhales

She stares at her own headshot at a younger her Sandie
looks crushed This is not the life she imagined

Sandie then snaps and hits her own headshot with her fist
The mirror cracks behind the photo

Ellie approaches goes to place her hand on Sandie’s
shoulder As she makes contact there is a knock at the door-

JACK (0S)
Where’s my Sandie

Sandie says nothing Jack knocks again more forceful

JACK (0S) (CONTD)
Night’s not over yet

Sandie and Ellie look toward the door in unison
JACK (0S) (CONTD)
Come on open up
66 INT HALL OUTSIDE SANDIE’S DRESSING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 66

The door opens but it is not Sandie who answers to Jack but
Ellie as Sandie inhabiting her body and dress

ELLIE
What do you want

JACK
Don’t talk daft You know

Jack grabs her hand and takes her back into the club

67 INT THE RIALTO - MOMENTS LATER 67

At a VIP booth in the club sits the CLUB OWNER and some rich
businessmen one of whom we will call POINTER

Jack approaches with Ellie Sandie in tow and sits down

POINTER a bespectacled sleaze leans forward to kiss Ellie
Sandie’s hand

POINTER
We were promised a great show And
show you did Show you did

ELLIE
(Quiet angry)
Thank you

Pointer doesn’t let go of her hand Ellie Sandie looks at
Jack hoping he will step in He doesn’t

POINTER
Maybe we could go for some drinks
Sandie Just us

ELLIE
I’m with Jack

POINTER
Jack doesn’t mind do you

JACK
Not one bit

Ellie Sandie looks at him shocked She gets up and leaves
Jack follows her catches up and grabs her arm

JACK (CONTD)
Sandie Get back here

SANDIE
Jack I don’t want to do this

Jack pulls her close his handsome face twisting into a
sneer It’s frightening

JACK
You told me you were serious about
being a performer so if you want
to keep doing it then these are
the kind of men that you need to
keep happy The men you really need
to perform for

SANDIE
No Jack

Sandie pulls away he chases after her
JACK

Everybody else is doing it what
makes you so special

Sandie turns back but is now an angry Eloise

ELLIE (AS SANDIE)
She said no

Ellie Sandie breaks away Jack shouts after her

JACK
We all have to start somewhere

INT BACKSTAGE - THE RIALTO - CONTINUOUS 68

Ellie runs into the dressing room area and frantically looks
for an exit in the warren of dressing rooms and corridors

Jack chases after her but even as she loses him she can
still hear his angry voice

JACK (0S)
Sandie Don’t be a damn fool

Ellie’s desperate search for an exit takes her through a maze
of misery She catches glimpses in rooms off this corridor

In the first room is a YOUNG DANCER sobbing on the phone

YOUNG DANCER
No It’s not what I thought

In the second room a slightly older DANCER takes two pills
She smiles into the mirror it doesn’t reach her eyes

JACK (0S)
Sandie This is the way it works

In the third room the DANCER is older again clearly on
uppers scantily clad dancing for a punter His hands are
all over her She squirms under his touch as he pulls off her
clothes

JACK (0S) (CONTD)
Id do what your manager tells you

In the fourth room we catch a glimpse of flesh - a DANCER is
naked servicing a customer Ellie runs faster now

JACK (0S) (CONTD)
You don’t want me to be unhappy do
you

In the fifth room a DANCER is on downers drug paraphernalia
litters the stained couch she lies on She stares at the
wall Lost and alone

JACK (0S) (CONTD)
Remember you were the one who
wanted this More than anything you
said

The passage out of this hellish club becomes unclear this
backstage world feeling more like a Kafka-esque trap

JACK (0S) (CONTD)
You know this is all an act You
know where this is heading Sandie
You owe me Where you gonna run to
Home

Hurriedly Ellie opens one last door in a dark hallway only

for it to open into-

INT SANDIES BEDROOM (1960S) - NIGHT 69

Ellie finds herself back in the ‘60s bedroom And before her-
Sandie On the bed Wrapped in sheets that are tangled post-
coital She’s sleeping or at least pretending to Ellie now
back in her PJs looks on horrified

Jacks voice echoes

JACK (AUDIO FLASHBACK) You willing to work your way up

She approaches Sandie to see if she’s okay Pulls the sheets
down to cover her naked legs

BARTENDER (AUDIO FLASHBACK) (0S)
You should speak to Jack He
manages a lot of girls
Ellie then sees on the nightstand-
A wad of pound notes Her face drops
JACK (AUDIO FLASHBACK) (0S)
This is just a taste of things to
come Sandie

Behind her-

The toilet flushes Light spills into the room as the
bathroom door opens

POINTER (0S)
Coo-ee

A perspiring Pointer enters in shirt and underwear He is
doing up his tie as he walks toward Sandie (and Ellie)

POINTER (CONTD)
I know you’re not asleep

Ellie’s face drops with horror She watches as the smug
Pointer approaches Sandie on the bed Then shouts-

ELLIE
Leave her alone

Pointer turns seemingly looking right at Eloise Then-
BEEP-BEEP-BEEP-BEEP

Both of them turn to look at Ellie’s alarm or the place
where her alarm should be

INT ELLIES BEDROOM (TODAY)- MORNING 70
BEEP-BEEP-BEEP-BEEP—

Ellie wakes with a start She reaches over to shut off her
alarm When suddenly-

POINTER’S HAND GRABS HER

POINTER
You know you’re not asleep

Pointer is here in the real world His sweaty smug face
leers directly at Ellie His clammy hand clutches her

INT ELLIES BEDROOM (TODAY) - MORNING 71
Ellie wakes with a start She’s alone

BEEP-BEEP-BEEP Her alarm is still going off

INT ELLIES BEDROOM (TODAY) - MOMENTS LATER 72
A freaked out Ellie stands in the kitchenette making a cup of
tea As the kettle boils she notices a loose flap of plaster
on the wall She pulls it back to reveal-

The ‘60s wallpaper pattern from the bedroom in her ‘dreams’

The sound of the whistling kettle mirrors her growing
anxiety This is proof of the reality in these dreams

She tears more paper away Reveals a handwritten message
underneath help me
INT CLASSROOM - LONDON COLLEGE OF FASHION - LATER 73

Ellie looking drawn and exhausted stands amid the busy
students working on their designs

Before her on a mannequin is a rough version of the dress
that Sandie was wearing in the first dream Jack’s voice
echoes in her head

JACK (VO)
You were the one who wanted this
More than anything you said

Ellie’s face contorts something between sadness and disgust

JACK (VO)
You’re mine now

She takes her draft drawing of the dress scrunches it up
Ellie then unpicks the fabric and dismantles her intricate
sewing John watches her obsessively undoing her work
Jocasta smirks and makes catty comments to Cami and company

Ms Tobin passes by and tries to stop her

MS TOBIN
Ellie What are you doing

ELLIE
Starting again

MS TOBIN
Wait This is just a wobble a
crisis of confidence See it all
the time But don’t stop now
Ellie You’re really on to
something here

Ms Tobin smooths out the crumpled sketch of Sandie and puts
it in Ellie’s hand Ellie stares at it haunted

INT THE TOUCAN - BASEMENT BAR - EVENING 74
Click - Carol snaps her fingers

The bar is practically empty Ellie is behind it looking at
the wrinkled drawing of Sandie on the bar top

CAROL
You tuned to the moon

Ellie looks at Carol huh

CAROL (CONTD)
Customer-

Ellie turns to see John at the bar waiting to be served He
waves flashes a smile Ellie folds up her sketch of Sandie
leaves it on the bar and moves over to John

ELLIE
Hi what do you want

JOHN

Well I heard you worked here now
and I was going for a drink and I
thought kill two birds with one
stone just because you seemed a
little upset in class today And I
thought maybe I could swing by and
see how you were getting on

ELLIE
Thanks I meant what do you want
to drink

They both look a little embarrassed

JOHN
Oh yeah Three Kronenbergs please

Ellie pulls the pints

JOHN (CONTD)
Heard you got a new place

ELLIE
Yeah I’m in a bed-sit
JOHN
That’s good right
ELLIE
Yeah it’s really something
else
JOHN

I mean it must be great living on
your own

ELLIE
Must be

Ellie tails off John can tell something’s not right

JOHN
Why what’s up

ELLIE
Nothing I’m just a little
overwhelmed at the moment London’s
a lot

John pauses for a beat Waiting to see if she’ll open up

JOHN
I get it Coming to the city can be
a nightmare Honestly Id be lying
if I said I was having the best
time in North London so far

ELLIE
Where did you move from

JOHN
South London

Ellie smiles a little at this She puts his pints on the bar

JOHN (CONTD)
I’m going to get these to my mates
but I know what’s it like to feel
you don’t belong And I’m a good
listener if you ever want to talk
about it

Ellie looks directly at John as he says this
He grabs his pints and leaves Carol jokes at her

CAROL
They’re meant to talk about their
problems to you not the other
way round

Ellie tries to laugh it off Her PHONE RINGS she looks at
the screen It’s Peggy calling She leaves the bar to take it
outside passing the folded sketch on the bar

Unseen by her the Silver Haired Gentlemen turns to watch her
leave He’s been at the bar this whole time He then looks at
the sketch left behind

PEGGY (0S)
How is everything you never tell
me anything anymore
EXT THE TOUCAN - NIGHT 75

Ellie on her break is on her cellphone talking to Peggy

PEGGY (0S)
Ellie I know you think you have

ELLIE

Ellie lets out a breath Visibly upset about lying to her
grandmother

SILVER HAIRED GENTLEMAN (0S)
Everything alright Ellie

We reveal The Silver Haired Gentleman is standing nearby He
takes a drag on a cigarette grins

SILVER HAIRED GENTLEMAN (CONTD)
Or do I call you Eloise like the
old song

ELLIE
I don’t know that song And how do
you know my name

SILVER HAIRED GENTLEMAN
I make it my business to know all
the pretty girls round here All
their problems Always have done

Ellie finds his gaze unnerving He offers her a cigarette

SILVER HAIRED GENTLEMAN (CONTD)
You smoke don’t you love

ELLIE
No

SILVER HAIRED GENTLEMAN
Must be thinking of some other
blonde

The Silver Haired Gentleman produces the crumpled sketch of
Sandie that Ellie left at the bar and hands it to her

SILVER HAIRED GENTLEMAN (CONTD)
Be well

He winks at her and wanders off into the night Ellie watches
him go the male Bartender comes out to collect glasses

BARTENDER
Was Handsey bothering you

ELLIE
Handsey

BARTENDER
Yeah he’s a bit of an octopus
Carol says he was a right ladies
man back in the day Probably
thinks he has a shot with you

Ellie stares at the Gentleman as he walks off The red lights
of a reversing garbage truck illuminate him ominously

INT THE TOUCAN - BASEMENT BAR - AFTER HOURS 76
As Carol closes up Ellie nurses the dregs of a whisky

ELLIE
Do you believe in spirits

CAROL
What kind of question is that That
brown stuff pays your wages

Ellie looks at Carol She’s serious

ELLIE
I mean do you believe in ghosts

CAROL
Ghosts Why are you scared down
here Look I believe every old
house public or not has its
history but this place If this
place is haunted by anything it’s
the good times The good vibrations
and I don’t mean The Beach Boys
When it’s empty in here all I hear
is the laughs Every gangster
every copper every red faced lush
has been in here and all those high
spirits have soaked into the walls
You could probably get drunk just
on that

ELLIE
Yeah
76A

Ellie stares down at her empty glass Carol sighs
CAROL

Ellie I love you girl you fit

right in But you can’t sleep here
INT HALLWAY APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT 76A
Eloise enters the dark hallway and switches on the timer
light She ascends the stairs to her room with trepidation
INT ELLIE’S ROOM - NIGHT 77

Ellie sits on her bed still in her coat The neon flashes
outside Red white blue- Red white blue-

She’s anxious fighting sleep She looks at the record
player Doesn’t feel like hearing anything Red white blue-

Red red red-

She looks at the walls worried about the spirits that may
have soaked in here Suddenly-

The record player starts playing of its own accord Ellie
stares at it Terrified Red red red-

Then the door swings open A furious and strung-out Jack
enters (from the ‘60s) He looks older his charms have
faded He storms toward Ellie

JACK
Come on They’re waiting for you

He grabs Ellie’s hand

ELLIE
Don’t touch me

JACK
No rest for the wicked Sandie

Jack drags her to the door and pushes her through it and into-

INT BASEMENT NIGHTCLUB (LATE 1960S) - NIGHT 78

SONG ‘LAND OF 1000 DANCES’ by The Walker Brothers

We are now in a new club Although it’s entirely mirrored it
feels dark and cavernous

Ellie has magically become Sandie again (Ellie is trapped in
the mirror as her reflection)

This club is sleazier the dance floor full of other girls
dancing with older businessmen There are booths at the side
where clandestine meetings take place between girls and
shifty looking men

Sandie is wearing a revealing mini-dress She looks at her
reflection in the mirror at her gaunt face pale and
colourless now from her nocturnal life She shakes her head
How did I end up here

A glowering Jack steps in front of the mirror We see him for
what he is not a manager but a pimp

Sandie stares up at him a hint of defiance in her eyes Jack
grabs her shoulders seethes

JACK
You know how to dance You know why
youre here Get on with it

He releases her She dances Full of melancholy She looks at
herself in the mirror again trying not to catch the eyes of
any of the men watching on

A heartbroken Ellie watches a prisoner in the mirror

A man approaches the dancing Sandie She looks up and meets
his eyes We will call him PUNTER 1

PUNTER 1
Hello there

INT NIGHTCLUB BOOTH DANCEFLOOR - INTERCUT 79

Sandie cigarette in hand sits in a corner booth with PUNTER
1 flanked by mirrors This one table is reflected into
infinity (Ellie is in the mirror helplessly watching on)

In the following sequence we see many shifty punters talk to
Sandie the quick cuts representing an endless succession of
nights in the claustrophobic club Passage of time is shown
by Sandie’s changing dresses which get darker and darker

(NB The dialogue is interspersed with shots of Sandie
dancing growing more and more hectic and out of control)

Champagne is placed on the table Sandie takes a glass turns
to Punter 1 with a fixed smile and dead eyes
SANDIE

offers Sandie a cigarette She takes it and answers

SANDIE

PUNTER 5
No What’s your real name love

Sandie glares at him

SANDIE
I reckon you’re a copper or something

He winks and smiles wryly at her

PUNTER 5
Do you now So what is it

SANDIE
Sandie

PUNTER 5
Youre too good for this Sandie

Sandie looks at Jack sitting at the bar with another girl
He watches her gloating

PUNTER 5 (CONTD)
Pretty little thing like you
laying in the gutter I’d get out
while you can girl You’re better
than this

She turns back sadness in her eyes as she flatly replies

SANDIE
I don’t think I am

(Ellie watches this and is crushed by this reply)
PUNTER 5

Course you are Just look in the
mirror

(Ellie starts banging the glass trying to convince Sandie
she’s better than this convince her to leave to run)

Sandie refuses to look at herself

SANDIE
What if I don’t want to

PUNTER 5
Then maybe it’s too late for you

ELLIE
No

Ellie pounds the glass it starts to crack draws the
attention of Punter 5

Ellie hits the glass harder It splinters and cracks

Ellie smashes through reaches from the mirror to grab
Sandie’s shoulder but then-

INT THE BEDROOM - NIGHT 80

Ellie wakes up in the bedroom She gathers herself but then
notices the flashing red neon which reveals-—

The wallpaper is the 1960s pattern The bed is different the
brass frames at the head and foot are like prison bars Ellie
looks up to the ceiling and sees an overhead mirror in this
reflection is Sandie dressed in tacky underwear Then-

Ellie sees A FIGURE in the shadows The flashing red neon
reveals a PUNTER from the club undressing

Every time the neon flashes to black the PUNTER changes The
red neon strobes through the passage of time and a multitude
of creepy men undressing for sex

Ellie shakes her head horrified

She looks to the vanity mirror and sees Sandie On every
strobe her negligee changes and her expression looks deader
with every pulse

Through the red and black strobes the morphing PUNTERS move
towards her we see their gnarled hands on the bedpost as
they advance on the bed changing Stripping

As the punters undress something even more sinister occurs
It is as if black ink has blotted out their features

The twisted smiles the hungry eyes everything individual
about them is stained with total darkness No longer
distinct now just an outline of a man Emotionless
soulless blank

They are no longer distinctly human they are-

SHADOWS

A procession of SHADOW MEN advance on Ellie Approaching her
bed We see a BELT UNBUCKLE And with that Ellie is up

Getting the fuck out of there

She rushes towards the bathroom door gets in and locks it

INT BATHROOM BEDROOM — MORNING 81
Ellie realises she’s in her modern bathroom
It’s daylight Her bedroom is empty

Ellie turns back to the bathroom sink Exhales Tries to calm
down

When she turns back into her room it is now full of-

SHADOW MEN Maybe 13 of them They fill the room their blank
faces staring back at Ellie their bodies a horrible void

On Ellie’s completely horrified face we cut to-

INT LONDON COLLEGE OF FASHION - EVENING 82

Ellie is back in college standing in front of her work but
doing nothing So exhausted she’s practically a zombie The
ghost of shock still on her face Only a few students are
left at this late hour John is among them

Ellie still has the same hair as Sandie but she’s reverted to
her own somewhat plain dark clothes John approaches

JOHN
Got plans tonight Ellie

ELLIE
(firmly)
Id love to come out

JOHN
I haven’t even said what it is yet

ELLIE
Right
JOHN
But you’re saying ‘yes’ anyway
ELLIE

house
JOHN

INT VAUXHALL PUB - HALLOWEEN PARTY - NIGHT 84

SONG ‘THERE’S A GHOST IN MY HOUSE’ by R Dean Taylor

We are in a huge South London pub that has been gloriously
decked out in horror paraphernalia for a Halloween disco

All the students from art and fashion have gone all out with
their costumes Everyone except John and Ellie who walk
around in dark clothes and simple ghost makeup - pale face
paint with dark eyes

Jocasta’s at the bar with Cami Ashley and Lara The quartet
are dressed as the teen witches from THE CRAFT Jocasta sees
John and Ellie Points them out to her sinister clique

JOHN
Do you wanna dance

ELLIE
I might need alcohol first

JOHN
Alright I’m on it

Jocasta comes over with two large cocktails for them

JOCASTA
No need Get these down ya

They take the drinks Jocasta smiles as they down them
JOCASTA (CONTD)
Happy Halloween love birds

INT VAUXHALL PUB - HALLOWEEN PARTY - LATER 85

SONG ‘HAPPY HOUSE’ by Siouxsie and The Banshees

Ellie is dancing on her own A pale figure in black clothes
in the sea of ornate costumes It’s magnetic to watch

John joins and the dance quickly becomes steamy They seem
high on life and each other Other students watch them steam
up the floor especially Jocasta and her costumed clique

The feeling on the dance floor is magical but a little
woozy Ellie smiles at this moment with him but then sees-

SHADOW MEN lurking in the crowd It’s impossible to tell if
they are the shadow men from her dream or just dark figures
in the club All around her dark outlines are dancing almost
writhing It turns frantic unnerving as dark limbs thrash
Ellie stares past John to now see on the dance floor-

SANDIE Dancing in the same frenzied fashion as she did in
the dingy basement bar Around her shadowy men check her
out

Ellie blinks at this haunting vision Then she sees-

JACK lurking on the dance floor too Glowering at Sandie

Ellie moves forward towards Sandie trying to get to her
through the melee of dancers and shadows

ELLIE
Sandie

Her voice is lost under the music Ellie keeps moving
onwards pushing through the crush of people to get to her

ELLIE (CONTD)
SANDIE

Flashes of Sandie’s blonde hair catch the disco lights Ellie
pushes though a final group of DANCERS to see-

Nothing Sandie is gone Jack too

John catches up with Ellie

JOHN
What is it El

Ellie feels dizzy she nods to the doors

ELLIE
I need some air
JOHN
Ellie
Ellie bolts
EXT VAUXHALL PUB - HALLOWEEN PARTY - MOMENTS LATER 86

Ellie leaves John trailing her She shakes her head certain
she imagined the silhouettes She stops at a lamp post and
tries to collect herself But up ahead she sees-

The Shadows of different couples in a nearby pedestrian
tunnel Is that Sandie with a punter Jack with another girl
watching them It’s difficult to tell what’s real John has
caught up with her

JOHN
Ellie Is there anything I can do

Ellie snaps out of her vision and sees that the shadowy
couples are in fact KISSING CLUB GOERS (gay and straight)
who are making out in the arches

ELLIE

I don’t want to be like this
JOHN

Like what
ELLIE

I wish I wish I was like
everybody else

JOHN
I’m glad you’re not

Ellie pulls John close to her and kisses him It starts to
lightly rain on their warm embrace

JOHN (CONTD)
Do you want to go somewhere else

They speak between kisses
87A

ELLIE
I’m not meant to have guys back
JOHN
Oh Okay
ELLIE
So you’ll have to be quiet
JOHN
Oh Okay You don’t want to just

get some sleep

ELLIE
I really don’t want to go to sleep

JOHN
Well I can keep you up

Ellie looks at him really John gets all embarrassed

JOHN (CONTD)
What am I saying

They laugh kiss again

SCENE 87 OMITTED

EXT APARTMENT BUILDING - GOODGE PLACE - NIGHT 87A

We see a soaked Ellie and John run through the rain to her
door laughing and shouting as they go The neon of the
French bistro bleeds into the puddles

INT HALLWAY - APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT 88
Ellie creeps into the hallway with John their makeup has run
off in the rain with only ghostly traces left She hits the
timer light and shushes John with her finger on his lips He
proceeds to kiss it and they begin making out

Ellie breaks off and they shake with the giggles as they
silently creep up the stairs

INT ELLIE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT 89

Ellie and John sit on the bed The room is lit with the
flashing neon Red white blue-

Theyre kissing It’s intimate very tender Some clothes
come off John is on top of her

Red red red-

Over his shoulder Ellie is distracted by a GLINT OF LIGHT It
dazzles her What is that She peers closer Above on the
ceiling is the OVERHEAD MIRROR from the dreams And in the
reflection is neither her nor John but-

Sandie In a night dress Lying on top of the bed She’s
struggling as Jack pins her down He is dressed in a suit and
waving a LARGE KNIFE in Sandie’s terrified face

Red red red-

The knife GLINTS with light that reflects back onto Ellie’s
terrified face Garbled ‘60s music echoes from beyond

Red red red-

ELLIE
Get off of me

John stops immediately rolls to her side

JOHN
Are you okay

Ellie’s eyes are glued to the ceiling to the struggle
between Jack and Sandie

JACK
I own you

John follows her eyeline but just sees the plain white
ceiling

JOHN
What’s wrong

Sandie looks at Ellie almost pleading

JACK
You belong to me

ELLIE
Get off her

John looks at Ellie frightened bewildered

JACK (0S)
Don’t you ever disobey me

ELLIE
Get off her get off her

JOHN
I’m not on her you what Ellie

Ellie can’t look away from the struggle in the mirror

JOHN (CONTD)
Ellie

Ellie’s eyes flit to John then to the vanity mirror behind
In that reflection she can also see Jack on top of Sandie
clutching her face the knife pointing dangerously close

Red red red-

JACK (0S)
Don’t you ever disrespect-—

Ellie looks up to see Jack looming over her with the knife

JACK (CONTD)
Me

She jumps off the bed and looks back her eyes glued to the
scene now playing out on the bed before her

Red red red-

Ellie sees Sandie and Jack struggle both hands on the
knife John sees nothing but a frightened Ellie

JOHN
Ellie what’s wrong

Ellie watches as Sandie’s free hand goes for Jack’s eyes
scratches at them she’s feral Jack smacks his hand across
Sandie’s face Raises the knife Ellie scrambles backwards

JOHN (CONTD)
ELLIE

BANG-BANG-BANG- The door Someone is trying to open it

MS COLLINS (0S)

visitors GET HIM OUT OF HERE I’1l

John looks around in a panic Ellie is still in a frightened
trance Ms Collins sounds furious John instinctively
reaches for his jeans and fumbles to put them on

MS COLLINS (0S)
Get Him Out

Ms Collins begins to unlock the door Ellie finally looks up
at the door as she hears the key

John struggles to put his jeans on at speed and trips
backwards into the vanity mirror smashing the glass

He then falls painfully against the bedside table knocking a
lamp to the floor and lighting the room in a peculiar way

Ellie sees in the vanity mirror reflection the hideously
refracted image of Sandie holding the knife at bay with one
hand and scratching Jack’s face with the other

Jack raises the knife

ELLIE
NO

Then the door flings open The room is lit from the hallway
outside casting Ms Collins as a silhouette

The figures of Sandie and Jack are also cast into silhouette

John freaks and runs out of the room The angry Ms Collins
attempts to hit him as his passes

MS COLLINS
Get Out

Ellie looks at John and Ms Collins but the GLINT OF STEEL
brings her back to the struggle before her when-

STAB STAB STAB Ellie sees the blade plunging She sees blood
spread all over Sandie’s throat and collar bone The horror
in Sandie’s eyes

John runs down the stairs as Ms Collins shouts after him

MS COLLINS (CONTD)
Get out of here you bastard

The timer light in the hall switches out Semi-darkness

Ellie is alone in the room with Jack laying on top of
Sandie’s body Blood seeping all over the sheets

Suddenly Ms Collins returns She reaches inside the door
and flicks the main lights ON

In a blink Jack Sandie and the blood are GONE

Only the rumpled sheets Ellie’s horrified face and the
smashed mirror and trail of John’s blood remain The place
fills with bright light Everything is normal

MS COLLINS (CONTD)
You okay

ELLIE
Yeah

MS COLLINS
Did he hurt you

ELLIE
No

MS COLLINS
You sure

ELLIE
He didn’t hurt me

Ellie looks scared and confused There’s a long pause

MS COLLINS
(colder )
We’1l talk about this in the
morning

Ms Collins slams the door shut Ellie is all alone ina
room that’s the site of a murder

INT ELLIES ROOM - BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER 90

Ellie is now in the bath clothed her eyes riveted awake
Scissors clasped to her chest Her terror palpable

INT ELLIES ROOM - MORNING 91

Ellie sweeps up the glass on the floor She looks gaunt with
exhaustion Dark circles gape under her red eyes

INT APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - DAY 92

Ellie knocks on her landlady’s door Ms Collins opens it

ELLIE
I’m sorry For everything

MS COLLINS
Well it won’t happen again will
it

ELLIE
No I’ll pay for the mirror too

MS COLLINS
We all pay for a broken mirror
dearie

Beat Ellie haltingly asks a question

ELLIE
Did a girl live upstairs before

MS COLLINS
Lots of girls have lived here over
the years

ELLIE
Someone called Sandie

Ms Collins looks at her bemused

MS COLLINS
Lots of girls have lived here and
not all of them with their real
names Why do you ask

ELLIE
Did someone die in my room

Ms Collins looks at her half-concerned half-amused

MS COLLINS
Dearie this is London someone has
died in every room in every
building in this whole city Every
street corner too And speaking of
which I would have killed your
gentleman friend last night if I
had caught him So count yourself
lucky broken mirror or not

Ms Collins firmly closes the door
Ellie stands there for a beat lost She glances up back to

her room She hears the creaking of the old stairs
Footsteps Ellie inches forward until she sees-

A pair of legs in SILHOUETTE walking slowly down

A SHADOW MAN is descending the stairs But is it just the one
punter or is it several They seem to change with each step

BANG A shadowy hand rests on the banister and the camera
tilts up to reveal

JACK Sneering at Eloise A malicious grin on his face

JACK
Where you going

Ellie answers this by bolting Fast

INT CLASSROOM - LONDON COLLEGE OF FASHION - MORNING 93

Ellie comes into class late Her bedraggled appearance
garners looks from other students

MS TOBIN
Good morning Ellie

John standing among some male mannequins looks over to her
She returns his gaze inches towards him but then she sees
Jocasta and Cami whispering and laughing Their eyes on her

JOCASTA
Ooh something happened last night

MOMENTS LATER Snip snip snip Ellie is cutting material with
her razor sharp scissors She looks burnt-out and exhausted
as she tries to bury herself in work

We see Ellie working with LARA who is wearing her prototype
dress she is altering the hem line with dressmaker’s pins

ELLIE
How’s that feel

Ellie glances up Lara is no longer present

Sandie is her face décolletage and hair covered in blood

Ellie drops her scissors on the ground and jumps back
knocking a rail flying It clatters through the still
classroom Ellie stares at the blood soaked Sandie

SANDIE
You know where to find me

Ellie looks around at the other students can they see this
When she looks back it’s not Sandie but LARA
93A

MS TOBIN
Eloise what’s wrong

LARA
Um Ellie Ellie Are you okay

Ellie keeps backing away from Lara The whole class is
staring at this car crash

JOCASTA (0S)
What the fuck is wrong with her

John walks over with concern

JOHN
Ellie Talk to me

Ellie’s eyes stick to John then behind him -

All of John’s mannequins are now SHADOW MEN She grabs her
scissors and runs-

JOHN (CONTD)

INT CORRIDOR LONDON COLLEGE OF FASHION - CONTINUOUS 93A

SONG ‘ALWAYS SOMETHING THERE TO REMIND ME’ by Sandie Shaw

Ellie burst out from the classroom Eyes turn and land on
her A sea of people in the busy hallway watching her She
pushes her way towards the exit

Ellie breaks into a section of corridor where a glut of MALE
MODELS stand waiting for fittings all scantily clad some
practically naked Ellie keeps moving through when suddenly-

Male hands grab at her Press their bodies against her Ellie
sees the Male Models as SHADOW MEN Pawing grasping Turning
into shadows as soon as they make contact with her

She bursts through a fire exit and sets off all the alarms

EXT LONDON COLLEGE OF FASHION STREETS - DAY 94

Ellie runs onto busy Regent Street She stops at a railing
and hyperventilates Her eyes dart around wildly she sees-

JACK among a crowd of shadow men outside Oxford Circus tube
He glares back at her She looks across the street sees-

A bloodied SANDIE Standing among the bustling shoppers

No one else seems to see these haunting voids Ellie runs
disappearing into Carnaby Street

EXT STREETS OF SOHO - CONTINUOUS 95

Ellie sprints through a maze of alleys and side streets
seeing a SHADOW MAN at every turn They get closer and
closer forcing her in random directions so she doesn’t know
Their blank features are a nightmarish vacancy

Her passage through the streets is dizzying Modern daytime
London now as terrifying as the ‘60s nights

She runs down an alley by a pub The men outside are all
staring at her As she passes a lamppost - in a blur they all
become menacing wraith-like SHADOW MEN

Not looking where she’s going she slams right into Jack

JACK
Where are you going

She sprints off Looking back behind her Jack is now the
Silver Haired Gentleman grinning

Just as she’s becoming woozy she then finds herself in front
of something tangible something hopeful

The blue lamp outside a police station

SCENE 96 OMITTED

INT POLICE INTERVIEW ROOM - LATER 97

Ellie sits in a bare interview room with a stone faced Male
Detective and a more open approachable Female Officer The
Male Detective reads back from his notes flatly

MALE DETECTIVE
Just so I’ve got this straight You
witnessed the murder last night
but you believe this was a vision
from the past the murder of a
young woman in the mid-to-late
1960s by a man who you believe to
be her pimp

Ellie nods

MALE DETECTIVE
You’re an art student correct

ELLIE
Fashion

MALE DETECTIVE
Have you ever taken hallucinogens
Acid mushrooms mescaline

FEMALE OFFICER
Were not going to get you in
trouble if you have

ELLIE
I know it sounds crazy but I’m not
on drugs I don’t take anything

FEMALE OFFICER
You were at a party before Could
you have been slipped something
Perhaps someone bought you a drink

Ellie thinks Jocasta Those cocktails She sinks As she
tries to recover Ellie sounds a little manic

ELLIE
No It started before last night
When I was sober I saw landmarks
in my dreams details of
nightclubs ones that I’d never
been to before and then I saw those
details in real life I saw the
wallpaper in the sixties version of
my room and then I found that same
wallpaper when I peeled off the
plaster

The detective stares at her Okay

ELLIE (CONTD)
Look I know something bad happened
to this girl because I have
these visions these visions of
the past And ever since I came to
London I keep seeing Sandie That’s
the murdered girl’s name

The detective looks at the officer trying to hold ina
laugh The officer ignores him keeps her focus on Ellie

MALE DETECTIVE
Is there a history of
schizophrenia or mental health
issues in your family

Ellie stares at the two cops she sidesteps the question

ELLIE
I know who the killer is It’s her
boyfriend I mean her pimp Jack

I’ve seen him in the present day
The Male Detective glances at his colleague noting it down

MALE DETECTIVE
You getting all this

ELLIE
There’s this man I’ve seen around
Soho who follows me and who
Well the first time I saw him
outside one of those models places
he didn’t take much notice of me
but he did suddenly take an
interest when I changed my hair-do
to the same style as the murdered
girl As Sandie’s

MALE DETECTIVE
This hair do

ELLIE
Look my point is I’ve seen Jack
I’ve seen the killer as an old
man Around Soho

MALE DETECTIVE
Can you narrow down ‘around Soho’

ELLIE
He drinks at The Toucan

Another agonizing pause

FEMALE OFFICER
Have you only been here a short
time

ELLIE
A few weeks

FEMALE OFFICER
London can be a lot Maybe it would
help if you spoke with someone

ELLIE
Look please just listen to me-

Ellie goes beetroot red aware of how ridiculous it sounds
out loud She looks ill

INT POLICE STATION TOILET - MINUTES LATER 98
Ellie throws up in the bathroom

FEMALE OFFICER (0S)
We are listening Ms Turner Try
and stay calm

She looks in the mirror Her skin is beyond pale a spectral
white

ELLIE (0S)
What do I need to do to convince
you I’m not crazy

FEMALE OFFICER (0S)
We don’t think you are We just
think you need a bit of help to
settle in A support system

She looks older worn Like Sandie in her dreams this life
is taking its toll

EXT COLLEGE LIBRARY - DAY 99

Ellie strides towards the entrance of the communal college
library

FEMALE OFFICER (0S)
You did the right thing Please
hear that okay I will look into
Sandie’s murder I have your
contact details so if anything
comes up Ill be in touch

INT COLLEGE LIBRARY - DUSK 100
Ellie strides into an enormous communal college library The

central atrium area is full of students of all types quietly
reading and working

FEMALE OFFICER (0S)
Though I will say in such cases
especially this old it’s hard
without something concrete to go
on even a last name

Ellie heads into the depths of the building a warren of
narrow aisles and quieter areas

She finds a research department that bursts with books
folders and files An aging male student mans the Information
Desk Ellie flashes her student ID at him

ELLIE
I want to look up murdered women

and missing persons in the Central
London area from 1960 to 1969

The info desk worker takes a second look at her ID

INFO DESK WORKER
Aren’t you a fashion student

ELLIE
Yeah it’s research

INFO DESK WORKER
You doing some cool fashion shoot
based on infamous murder sites or
something

ELLIE
Yeah that’s exactly right
101 INT LIBRARY - MICROFICHE SECTION - LATER 101
Newspaper articles flash up The headlines read

‘CAMDEN BARMAID STABBED DIES’ ‘POLICEWOMAN SHOT NEAR
SCRUBS’ ‘BOXER APPEARS IN COURT FOR WAITRESS MURDER’

Ellie is totally lost in these endless vintage articles when-
a hand touches her shoulder A voice WHISPERS

WHISPERING VOICE (0S)
Ellie

Ellie jumps Fuck It’s just John Standing right there

ELLIE
Jesus Why whisper like that

JOHN
It’s a library

ELLIE
Right

JOHN

I have your stuff You ran out
Left your bag

John places her bag on the floor next to her He has folded
her white Mackintosh over it and her scissors peek out of
the bag at her Ellie looks bewildered to his presence

JOHN (CONTD)
Everyone’s here

Ellie looks over into the atrium She can now see other
students from the course boning up on coursework

JOHN (CONTD)
Listen about what happened last
night

The tired unravelling Ellie doesn’t know how to answer

JOHN (CONTD)
I mean if I did something wrong-

ELLIE
You didn’t It’s not about you

JOHN
Then what is it El

John is quiet She looks down to the huge pile of crime files
and folders around her John picks up a folder from the pile
and looks at the spine - ‘CENTRAL LONDON CRIME - 1965’

ELLIE
You’1l think I sound crazy

JOHN
Talk to me

Ellie takes a breath Even though they are very alone in this
maze-like wing of the library she whispers quietly

ELLIE
Last night I saw something in the
bedroom from the past

John takes it all in slowly

ELLIE (CONTD)
Fuck I do sound crazy

JOHN
No What did you see

Ellie thinks She sees flashes of the murder the blade
Sandy crying out for help

ELLIE
A girl was stabbed There’s a girl
who used to live in my room Sandy
The guy who killed her is still out
there So I’m looking for murdered
women or missing persons from the
sixties to try and find out her
name I have to find who she was
if I don’t I’m going to lose my
mind Maybe I already have

John looks at the microfiche she’s using and the grim
headlines about Soho disappearances

ELLIE (CONTD)
Feel free to run a mile

JOHN

Listen my aunty believes in all
sorts of weird shit So you just
tell me how I can help

ELLIE
Well I guess you could get the
next year of boxes 1966

John looks at the huge pile of folders again

JOHN
Damn This is just one year

ELLIE
London is a bad place

102 INT LIBRARY - MICROFICHE SECTION - A FEW MOMENTS LATER 102
Ellie is alone again at the microfiche We observe her from a
distance dwarfed by the tall shelves of the long aisles She
flicks through the microfiche and finds this headline

‘FATHER OF TWO MISSING PRESUMED DEAD AFTER MAYFAIR PARTY’

She peers at the screen and then-

HER PHONE GOES OFF She quickly silences it The caller is
‘Peggy’ Ellie pulls a face ‘Not now’ As Ellie concentrates
on the screen again unseen to her-

We can see a hideous lurking silhouette appear in the
distance A SHADOW MAN stalking slowly down the empty aisle

Another headline ‘YORKS FACTORY OWNER MISSING FOR 2 WEEKS’

Another SHADOW MAN appears in the aisle standing closer
Another headline ‘TEACHER DISAPPEARS AFTER SOHO NIGHT’

Another SHADOW MAN appears behind Ellie even closer

Ellie shuttles through several other similar headlines never
noticing the growing ranks of SHADOW MEN until

A dark shadowy hand touches her shoulder-

ELLIE
That was quick

OTHER WHISPERING VOICE (0S)
Helll

Ellie turns A SHADOW MAN looms above her FUCK
She bolts out of her chair Turns to look up the aisle

There’s ELEVEN SHADOW MEN advancing upon her

John is nowhere to be seen No other students are She grabs
her bag from the floor and flees sprinting down an aisle

She races through the maze of aisles the SHADOW MEN right
behind her She fumbles with her bag taking out the
scissors but dropping the bag and Mackintosh to the floor

As she races she sees SHADOW MEN in the next aisles
advancing towards her Converging on her

Every other aisle however alternates with a MALE STUDENT or
LIBRARY WORKER They look over at Eloise with concern

This dizzying zoetrope of SHADOW MEN and real men climaxes as-

SLAM she careens into a six foot tall SHADOW MAN his arm
grabbing at her Ellie falls back and runs in the other
direction (Behind her we briefly see the INFO DESK WORKER
where the SHADOW MAN just was)

She runs down another aisle But is blocked by SHADOW MEN at
every turn They seem to blink on and off with the lights

ELLIE
Fuck You

She runs back out the way she came (Behind her we see male
students where she had just seen Shadow Men) and charges at a
solitary Shadow Man with the scissors The Shadow Man turns
at the last moment BUT-

Just as Ellie stabs towards its face

John catches Ellie’s stabbing arm and stops the scissors from
plunging directly into-

JOCASTA’S FACE

There is no Shadow Man Only a manic Ellie John gripping her
arm and a completely freaked out Jocasta

Ellie is losing it Jocasta is about to Only John is calm

JOHN
It’s okay

JOCASTA
It’s not fucking okay What in the
actual fuck

Jocasta backs off in shock then runs to get security

JOHN
Stay here

John takes off after her removing the scissors from Ellie

JOCASTA (0S)
SECURITY

Ellie pants terrified Adrenaline still surging

Jocasta runs through the atrium shouting for security John
runs after her Students stand up in the library curious

Embarrassed Ellie walks fast in the other direction
scooping up her dropped bag and Mackintosh as she does

Ellie puts on her coat as she makes for an exit stairwell
but is then distracted by something out of the window

SANDIE
Walking through the campus grounds A vision in a long white

Mackintosh with her blonde ‘Bardot’ She walks past other
students but they seem not to notice her nor she them
102A

Ellie instinctively walks after her in a trance like state

INTEXT LIBRARY LOBBY - CONTINUOUS 102A

Ellie runs out after Sandie as John and Jocasta are ina
heated discussion with a confused security guard Jocasta
sees Ellie sprinting for the door

JOCASTA
That’s her Total fucking lunatic

SECURITY GUARD
Miss come back here please

Too late Ellie is gone Out into the night

EXT THE STREETS OF SOHO - NIGHT 103

The streets of Soho are dark and blurry the world shifts and
undulates around the manic Ellie as she chases wisps of
Sandie’s blonde hair or flashes of her white mackintosh
through avenues and side streets

It’s raining now a light mist that makes the neon lights
bleed and reflect gaudily off the wet tarmac

Ellie snakes after Sandie into darker alleys time and
reality have lost all meaning to her now the 1960s cascades
into present day - street signs seem to be from 50 years ago
people on the street are not dressed in modern fashions

Ellie runs down a red lit alley She stops when she sees in a
neon lit window -

Two prostitutes staring back at her from a red lit bedroom
As she stares at herself she hears

JACK (0S)
Oi

Ellie looks down Jack is standing in the now 1960s alley
surrounded by punters and streetwalkers He sneers at Ellie

JACK (CONTD)
Where do you think you are going

Ellie looks in the other direction and sees-

SANDIE Walking through a tunnel of SHADOW MEN They turn to
lurch towards Ellie

JACK (CONTD)
You think you can just walk away

Approaching from all angles appearing from the dark corners
of the street with their hands out trying to grab her

Ellie starts to run pushing them aside and barging through
One whispers

SHADOW MAN
Hell

A shadowy hand pulls on Ellie’s belt buckle of her jacket
pulling her back into the seething darks mass of hands and
groaning men Ellie angrily pushes back at them-

ELLIE
LEAVE ME ALONE

She pushes one to the ground Turns Runs for her life

Ellie swings into another alley Gaining on Sandie But
behind her she still hears-

JACK (0S)
Come back here slut

Ellie turns to see Jack striding after her Shadow Men
flanking him like a black sea of punters

JACK (CONTD)
Get back here you whore

Ellie runs Catches up with Sandie Puts her hand on her
shoulder once more But then-

Sandie spins around angrily Looking right through Ellie Her
face a mask of rage

SANDIE
LEAVE ME ALONE

Sandie pushes at Ellie and connects with her shoulder As

Sandie’s angry voice echoes Ellie falls backwards She hits
the glistening wet of the tarmac landing firmly in-

Soho Present day
Reeling Ellie slowly stands to find--

No Sandie She turns behind her She cannot see the Shadow
Men She cannot see Jack

But across the street glimpsed behind traffic that zooms
past she can see a familiar figure THE SILVER HAIRED
GENTLEMAN He is ambling down the street in exactly the same
spot she last saw Jack

She watches him stroll along Then shouts

ELLIE
Jack JACK

Ellie is drowned out by the busy traffic The Silver Haired
Gentleman does not hear her and disappears around the corner

Ellie soaked through and disorientated stalks after him
Rushes rounds the bend and - he’s gone She finds herself
outside of-

THE TOUCAN She strides in determined steely

EXT THE TOUCAN - NIGHT 104
Ellie heads towards the door The Bartender smokes outside
BARTENDER

been covering for you downstairs

She doesn’t even look at him as she crosses the threshold

SONG ‘ELOISE’ by Barry Ryan

Ellie enters to see the Silver Haired Gentleman sitting on
his usual stool at the bar He is air conducting the
bombastic intro to the song which emanates from the jukebox

Before Ellie walks into his field of vision she starts her
iPhone recording She then slips behind the bar When he
spots her a huge grin splits his face
SILVER HAIRED GENTLEMAN
And here she is

The Silver Haired Gentleman seems a little merry Ellie’s

face is stone utterly determined

SILVER HAIRED GENTLEMAN (CONTD)
Your siren song is playing I just
put this on the jukebox and lo and
behold you appear Carol was
worried about you thought youd
gone missing I told her no one
ever really disappears they’re
always around somewhere

ELLIE

Ellie hides the iPhone behind the bar She’s on edge

SILVER HAIRED GENTLEMAN

of numbers love

She takes a glass and begins to pour

ELLIE
I hear you were quite the ladies

SILVER HAIRED GENTLEMAN

ELLIE

SILVER HAIRED GENTLEMAN
A lot of them I knew all of them

ELLIE

SILVER HAIRED GENTLEMAN
Who didn’t know Sandie

Ellie tenses up He notices Enjoys it

SILVER HAIRED GENTLEMAN (CONTD)
(Singing along)
My Eloise-a Id love to please

Ellie hugely unnerved tries to keep it together

SILVER HAIRED GENTLEMAN (CONTD)

ELLIE
(Yes)
No

SILVER HAIRED GENTLEMAN
I knew all the girls Like to think
I looked after them Had to keep
them in order too mind Keep them
in line Sandie she was special
though She didn’t belong Thought
she was too good for it She was
probably right to be honest But
you know at the end of the day you
all look the same on a slab

ELLIE
I know what you did

SILVER HAIRED GENTLEMAN
(not missing a beat)
I’ve done a lot of things Eloise
You’re going to have to be more
specific love

ELLIE
I know what you did to Sandie

SILVER HAIRED GENTLEMAN
Do you now

ELLIE
I saw her I see her I know what
happened

SILVER HAIRED GENTLEMAN
Well whatever happened to Sandie
she brought it on herself

Ellie looks at him shocked

ELLIE
No one deserves that

The Silver Haired Gentleman drops the smile and jabs a finger
at her

SILVER HAIRED GENTLEMAN
Listen I know where you live
Eloise

(MORE)

SILVER HAIRED GENTLEMAN (CONTD)
And I don’t know what you’ve seen
or heard but I can tell you Sandie
ended up exactly where she wanted
to be Funny you mention her
though because the first thing I
did when I dragged myself back to
this miserable Smoke was look up
her old bones But turns out some
people don’t want to found

The Silver Haired Gentleman gets up from his stool and walks
towards the exit

ELLIE
You killed her

SILVER HAIRED GENTLEMAN
You think I killed Sandie

Ellie throws a pint glass onto the ground smashing it to
pieces

ELLIE
(firmly)
I know you did

The Silver Haired Gentleman laughs at this

SILVER HAIRED GENTLEMAN
Ha I think you’ll find Alex killed
Sandie

He then walks towards the exit and the outdoor steps to the
street Ellie follows not sure how to stop him

ELLIE
Come back

SILVER HAIRED GENTLEMAN
Nah I’ve had enough of this line
of questioning You think she was
an angel But don’t be fooled

The Silver Haired Gentleman walks up the stairs Ellie grabs
her iPhone and runs after him shouting

ELLIE
I’m recording this You won’t get
away with it

SILVER HAIRED GENTLEMAN
So what I do what I like in this
manor

The Silver Haired Gentleman exits into the busy street

EXT THE TOUCAN - CONTINUOUS 107
Ellie chases him as he crosses the street

ELLIE

The Silver Haired Gentleman angrily turns to tower over her

SILVER HAIRED GENTLEMAN
Like I give a flying fuck

ELLIE
Wait-

He backs away His face furious as he spits at Ellie
SILVER HAIRED GENTLEMAN
When you see Alex in whatever
little hell she’s currently in you
tell her I said hello-

BOOM A Black Taxiknocks the SILVER HAIRED GENTLEMAN flying

CRACK His old body crumples sickeningly as he flies over the
bonnet and crunches brutally to the floor

Ellie lets out a silent scream covering her face with her
hands She drops her iPhone to the floor It shatters

Bystanders on the street turn and gasp The TAXI DRIVER
brakes hard and gets out He sees the corpse of the SILVER
HAIRED GENTLEMAN in the gutter a grimace on his bloody face

TAXI DRIVER
Oh my good God

Ellie unravels the sound of the commotion almost drowned in
an interior WHINE as hysteria takes hold on the street

Behind the Bartender and Carol run out to the grim scene

BARTENDER
Jesus what happened Ellie

Ellie stares at the bartender blankly A crowd has started to
gather Carol recoils in shock

TAXI DRIVER
He just stepped out I wasn’t
expecting it

CAROL
Oh Lindsey You poor bastard
Call an ambulance pet Now

The Bartender immediately dials ‘999’ on his phone

CAROL (CONTD)
Hey tell them Lindsey used to be

Ellie still in a daze looks at Carol

ELLIE
Lindsey

CAROL
Yeah he was ex-vice He was a
copper in Soho for years and years
And now look at him Laying there
in the gutter

Ellie is very confused by this conversation

ELLIE
His name’s not Jack

CAROL
Jack No love that’s Lindsey

Ellie’s face pales She turns and walks away As she realises
who Lindsey is (PUNTER 5) she is haunted by his words

PUNTER 5 LINDSEY

I’d get out while you can girl

Ms Collins unbolts her door to see Ellie’s anxious face

MS COLLINS (CONTD)
You look like youve had a fright

ELLIE
I need your help

MS COLLINS
Just you is it

ELLIE
Yeah

MS COLLINS
I’1l get the kettle on Come in

Ellie enters and Ms Collins peers into the hallway

INT GROUND FLOOR FLAT - CONTINUOUS 112

SONG ‘ANYONE WHO HAD A HEART’ by Cilla Black

This is the first time Ellie has been in Ms Collins’ flat
since she moved in An old vinyl player she didn’t previously
notice plays Cilla Black There’s an old record box open too

MS COLLINS
Your music upstairs got me breaking
out my old records

Ellie sits as Ms Collins boils the kettle She calls out

MS COLLINS (CONTD)
Oh I picked up a letter for you by
mistake It’s in that pile

Ellie sees a pile of post on the coffee table and shuffles
through the letters addressed to ‘Ms Alexandra Collins’
until she finds one letter addressed to her

She puts Ms Collins’ post back and notices a lit cigarette
in the ashtray Ms Collins returns with a cup of tea

MS COLLINS (CONTD)
Don’t judge me on the cigarettes
All that hoo-haa the other night
got me going again

ELLIE
I’m sorry

MS COLLINS
It’s okay I’ve always been on the
edge

Ms Collins brings the cup of tea over and sits opposite
Ellie She takes the cigarette from the ashtray and draws

MS COLLINS (CONTD)
So you have something you want to
talk about

Ellie gathers herself

ELLIE
Ms Collins I’m so sorry to do
this and I really didn’t want to be
this person but I am leaving
tonight

MS COLLINS
Are you now

ELLIE
(at speed)
I’m not having a good time here and
I need to go back home and I
promise I will pay for the mirror
but I really need some of my
deposit I’ve got nothing

MS COLLINS
Slow down-

ELLIE
I don’t want to beg but this has
been a disaster-

MS COLLINS
Slow down Hush Drink your tea

Ellie does so and sips at her tea Ms Collins smiles

MS COLLINS (CONTD)
You spoke to the police didn’t
you About the room upstairs Mm

ELLIE
Yeah

Even though Ms Collins is smiling Ellie can’t meet her eye
and just sips her tea again

MS COLLINS
A nice police lady came around
asking questions about you About
your wellbeing Welfare check she
called it It had me worried Youd
been saying a girl died up there

ELLIE
I’m sorry

MS COLLINS
Well it’s funny because there is
some truth in it

Ellie looks up at Ms Collins who has a smile on her face

MS COLLINS (CONTD)
I’ve never thought about it that
way until you brought it up but a
girl did die up there I suppose

Ellie’s eyes widen as Ms Collins continues in the same calm
unnerving yet cheery tone

MS COLLINS (CONTD)
The young me that came to this big
city

Ellie’s eyes flick to the pile of post and the name ‘Ms
Alexandra Collins’ She whispers to herself

ELLIE
Sandie

Ellie is reeling at this Ms Collins smiles darkly and takes
a drag of her cigarette

MS COLLINS
I had hopes and dreams like you
did I wanted to be a singer I
wanted to perform To act Being
a whore is a bit like being an
actress I suppose You have to
pretend you’re someone else
Someone that’s not you I’d pretend
I was somewhere else That this
wasn’t happening to me Try and
forget all those all those men
their faces I’d blank them out I
had to I had to make like they
were nothing

Off Ellie’s face we see a QUICK FLASH CUT MONTAGE of the
punters approaching Sandie’s bed lasciviously They are human
once more but their faces are still shrouded in shadow

MS COLLINS (CONTD)
So yeah you could say Sandie died
up there She died in that room A
hundred times

Ms Collins traces a finger along her right palm showing an
old scar that runs along it A deep nasty wound

MS COLLINS (CONTD)
And then one night the man who put
me here the man who put me to
work the man who stole my dream I
put a knife in him A hundred
times

A FLASH CUT MONTAGE of Jack menacing Sandie in her bed with
the knife When he goes to stab her she grabs the blade
Wrestles it away from him and pushes the knife back into
Jacks throat Blood splashes on her face She then stabs him
again and again from under him What Ellie saw was not Jack

stabbing Sandie it was the exact opposite

Back in the room Ms Collins still smiles unnervingly

MS COLLINS (CONTD)
And I tell you what Ellie I can
call you Ellie can’t I

ELLIE
oe yeS

MS COLLINS
It felt right Ellie So many of
those bastards who came ringing my
bell came creeping up my stairs
They sent me to my hell so I sent
them to theirs

QUICK FLASH CUT MONTAGE of Sandie slashing the throats of a
succession of sleazy punters We see flashes of their real
faces now rendered in vivid flesh scared and shocked

Back to Ellie realisation dawning

MS COLLINS (CONTD)
The papers called them “missing
persons” Far as I’m concerned
they were already lost So people
don’t know where they are I say
they didn’t know who they were I
did everyone a favour

QUICK FLASH CUT MONTAGE - We see the now dead punters buried
in dark wall-spaces and under floorboards

MS COLLINS SANDIE
(gets stronger)
I wasn’t going to be used anymore
Wasn’t going to let this city break
me

ELLIE
I’m so sorry

MS COLLINS
Why It’s not your fault

ELLIE
I mean I understand I know what
youve been through

Ms Collins’ smile becomes a sneer

MS COLLINS
Oh do you

ELLIE
I I didn’t mean to get you in
trouble With the police

MS COLLINS
Oh it’s okay They think you’re
mad and it’s not like you’re
going to tell anyone else

ELLIE
Of course not I would never

MS COLLINS
No I mean I know you’re not
telling anyone else

Ms Collins looks at the tea in Ellie’s hand Ellie

follows her gaze Feels woozy Drops the cup to the floor

MS COLLINS (CONTD)
Don’t worry I’m not going to stab
you like the others I wouldn’t do
that to you

Ellie clutches the arm rest of her seat her head reels

MS COLLINS (CONTD)
Youre going to go to sleep And
they’1l just say you topped
yourself Because you know everyone
thinks you were going to do that
anyway They are all very concerned
about you Bless

Ellie feels stomach pangs

MS COLLINS (CONTD)
So just get comfy and you can doze
off listening to some of your nice
music

ELLIE
No

Ellie croaks her full voice suddenly gone

MS COLLINS
Shush You take it easy No more
excitement

DING DONG Someone is at the door Ms Collins gets up
opens the curtain to see-

JOHN He presses the doorbell a second time

MS COLLINS (CONTD)
Oh ‘just you’ is it Little liar

She

Ms Collins grabs a knife from the kitchen on the way out to
the door Ellie tries to get up and stop her

ELLIE
NO

Ms Collins turns and slaps Ellie HARD knocking her to the
ground Her head cracks on the floor her eyes glaze

MS COLLINS
Just coming dearie

Ms Collins disappears into the hallway Ellie tries to get
up but the world spins around her She grasps for purchase
her hands find the table top

She heaves herself up and pushes towards the door Bumping
the table on the way - knocking the ashtray and Ms Collins’
lit cigarette into the record box-

INT HALLWAY and STAIRS - CONTINUOUS 113
Ms Collins opens the door a crack to talk to John

MS COLLINS
What is it

JOHN
Um I’m here to see Ellie

MS COLLINS
She’s upstairs Come on in

Ellie comes into the hallway just as Ms Collins lets John
in Ellie (in real pain) is about to scream-

John sees Ellie’s face knows something is wrong

ELLIE
Run

Ms Collins stabs John in the stomach He falls

ELLIE (CONTD)
No

Ms Collins swings around to Ellie with the knife
MS COLLINS

Will you keep it down Screaming loud
enough to wake the bloody dead

SLASH Ms Collins swipes at Ellie who catches her hand with
the blade Ellie reels from the deep cut to her palm and
falls backwards onto the stairs smacking her head on a step
She screams in pain and looks up

Concussed and bleeding she then sees

INT DREAMSCAPE HALLWAY and STAIRS - CONTINUOUS 114

SONG ‘YOU’RE MY WORLD’ by Cilla Black

This section crosscuts between the real struggle of Ellie
trying to crawl back up the stairs away from the knife
wielding Ms Collins and

A dreamscape version of the same the point of view of a
concussed and drugged Ellie imagining the same events but in
a fantasy version of a deserted after hours Café de Paris

In this timeline Ellie (in full Sandie evening dress) tries
to escape a knife wielding Young Sandie who is also
resplendent in a dazzling gown As Young Sandie approaches -
she is lip synching Cilla Black

We see the following in the two timelines

Ellie scrambling upstairs while backwards SandieMs Collins
advancing on her knife in hand

In the dreamscape the dimensions of the room and the stairs
are elastic The staircase seems to be infinite and
impossible to reach the top

In the real world Ellie struggles up the stairs Behind Ms
Collins fire and smoke spill out of Ms Collins’ room
smothering John

JOHN
Fire Fire

We crosscut back and forth until Ms Collins gets closer and
Ellie kicks her in the shin She struggles to get up

SANDIE
I’ll get you I’11 kill you

Ellie rounds onto the landing and then the world spins She
keels over her bleeding hand still gripping the banister
trying to stay upright

A wave of nausea hits her She throws up then stumbles
onwards

INT BEDROOM DREAMSCAPE BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS 115

Ellie gets inside her bedroom and locks the door behind her
Smoke is already beginning to rise up through the floor She
looks over to see the LANDLINE on the other side of the room
on her bedside table

Ellie runs to the landline but then-

A SHADOWY ARM bursts through the floorboards and grabs her
ankle She falls to the floor hard face first

Another SHADOW ARM bursts through then another Soon the
floor is a sea of pitch black arms rising and clawing at her

The line between the real room and the dreamscape starts to
blur into one and the same as Ellie becomes ensnared in the
sea of limbs the phone suddenly a long way away

The heads of the Shadow Men burst through the floor We hear
them groaning once more-

SHADOW MEN
Hell hell

Behind her we see the door handle move Shake

Ellie wrenches herself free of the shadowy arms that have
sprouted from all over But then the walls start to crack

She looks in horror as SHADOW MEN break out of the wallpaper
and plaster in the walls All around Ellie the SHADOW MEN
emerge from the tombs of the floor and walls

SHADOW MEN (CONTD)
Hell hell

She is surrounded and overwhelmed struggling to stay
conscious with the poison in her blood the smoke in the air

Behind we hear the door start to unlock

MS COLLINS (0S)
Eloise

Ellie fights off the hordes of SHADOW MEN who claw at her as
she crawls onto the bed and reaches for the phone Shadowy
limbs grab at her body as she grabs for the phone She is
very close to reaching the receiver when-

A TALL SHADOW MAN bursts out of the floor on the other side
of the bed by the phone He rises up and stares at Ellie

Ellie freezes in fear as the Tall Shadow Man reaches for the
phone picks up the receiver and-
Holds it out to Ellie

TALL SHADOW MAN
Hellp Help

Ellie can start to make out the face of the Tall Shadow Man
It’s one of the punters from earlier And he looks-

Scared

TALL SHADOW MAN (CONTD)
Help

Ellie looks to the grotesque Shadow Men at the foot of her
bed in a chorus they all start groaning for ‘help’

The Tall Shadow Man’s face twists into a snarl He whispers

TALL SHADOW MAN (CONTD)
Kill her

The Shadow Men at the foot of the bed repeat the mantra more
of an instruction than a plea

SHADOW MEN
Kill her kill her

TALL SHADOW MAN
Save us kill her

Eloise slowly but emphatically shakes her head

ELOISE
No

Suddenly the door swings open and-
Ms Collins walks in knife aloft advancing on Ellie

(NB This is the first time she’s stepped into the room in
any of the present day scenes)

The Shadow Men stop clawing at Ellie and start cowering in
the presence of Ms Collins

Ms Collins looks at all the Shadow Men and stops dead her
expression changing from steely to horror

As the expression changes on Ms Collins’ face we no longer
see the shadow men anymore we now see the punters she
murdered all those years ago They are no longer blanked out
they are as they appeared when she killed them

And all around Ellie in this twisted tableau are the 1960s

versions of the punters that Ms Collins killed Trapped in
the moment of death scared cowering bleeding from their

necks and faces

We recognise the punters from the dream in the mirrored
discotheque Their faces are drained of nearly all colour
the only remaining shade is the ghastly red of their
injuries Both the dead punters and Ellie recoil in fear as
they wait to see what Ms Collins will do next

Their screams build as Ms Collins’ horror grows We move
into Ms Collins’ face and see in the reflection of her
eyeglasses JACK

JACK
I’m with you to the end Sandie

We now see what Ms Collins sees The array of all the
pathetic men she killed And in the middle of them a
sneering Jack dressed in the clothes he was murdered in

JACK (CONTD)
You were the one that wanted this

Ellie lies on the bed frozen in horror as Jack approaches
Ms Collins with an evil grin

JACK (CONTD)
More than anything you said

Jack raises his hand to strike Ms Collins She flinches in
pain and the world returns to normal

Smoke is pissing up the stairwell Black and acrid thick as
fabric It swirls and catches the neon lights from outside

Eloise looks on as Ms Collins stands in the room shocked
struck In the full length mirror behind her she also sees

SANDIE
Young innocent and full of hope Ellie watches both the
older Ms Collins and the ghost of her younger self the

person she lost

A long beat it drips with Ms Collins’ sadness and regret
The bedroom is starting to burn

MS COLLINS SANDIE
I didn’t

Ms Collins drops her knife to her side Shakes her head
Sirens start to sound in the distance Ms Collins knows
there’s no way out She looks to Eloise

MS COLLINS
I didn’t want any of this

ELLIE
I know I saw

MS COLLINS
They deserved it

ELLIE
I know

The sirens are getting louder
MS COLLINS SANDIE
I’m not going to prison I’ve been

in one all my life

Ms Collins raises the knife once more but moves to slash
her own throat

ELLIE
No

Ellie jumps up and runs to Ms Collins as she drags the blade
across her throat We see the knife cut her flesh

As Ellie reaches her and grips the blade it cuts into her
palm but doesn’t reach Ms Collins throat

As she pushes the blade away from Ms Collins’ neck we now
suddenly see

Ellie embrace Young Sandie She wrestles the blade away from
her throat and hurls it across the room

Young Sandie is slightly bleeding from the neck Ellie
embraces her and cries as the blood spreads over her dress

SANDIE
Please

Ellie looks Young Sandie in the eye
ELLIE

You don’t have to do this You can
live Please live

SANDIE
You have to let go

Young Sandie’s expression turns to anger She pushes Ellie
away from her Her face wrought with anguish

SANDIE (CONTD)
Leave

Sandie Bleeding backs away from Ellie The fire is now out
of control Flames lick up the walls

ELOISE
No

Eloise runs forward to grab her back from the fire but she
pushes back defiantly

SANDIE
You can’t save me

Ellie understands She sees that the flames are rising and
the smoke is thickening rapidly The photo of her mum on the
side table is burning up

Now in front of her once more is Ms Collins

MS COLLINS
Save yourself Save the boy Go

She pushes Eloise towards the door She runs out of the room
coughing violently

Before she runs downstairs Ellie looks back to the room to
see

MS COLLINS Now sitting down on the bed much like Ellie did
the first night she moved in

It’s a serene image in the middle of a raging inferno

The smoke thickens Ms Collins disappears in it

INT HALLWAY and STAIRS - CONTINUOUS 116

Ellie battles through the smoke and hobbles down the stairs
towards John who still lies in a heap by the front door

As Ellie is about to reach the fallen John she trips down
the last few steps and lands next to him on the ground

The flames and smoke are now very intense
117A

John is out cold and bleeding heavily Ellie crawls over to
shake him awake She cries

ELLIE
John John Get up

John doesn’t answer and there’s a violent cracking sound

A shaft of light lands on Ellie’s face She looks up to see-
A Fireman axing the door down coming to save them Blue
lights surround the fireman as he fills the frame

EXT APARTMENT BUILDING - MOMENTS LATER 117

Fire engines and ambulances fill the street outside the
apartment building which is now completely engulfed in flame

Emergency workers race to extinguish the blaze while other
residents watch the now funeral pyre of the building glow

In the middle of the street on stretchers are Ellie and John
She is given oxygen as John is lifted into an ambulance (We
see an EMT rip open John’s hoodie and attend to his wounds)

Ellie’s stretcher is then carried into her own ambulance As
she’s lifted she sees an image of THE WHOLE HOUSE ON FIRE

SLAM - the doors close and her ambulance starts moving

We see the blue flashing lights on her face Ellie begins to
drift into unconsciousness

Blue flashing lights Blue flashing lights
As Ellie passes out she imagines

The record player in her bedroom melting from the heat of
the fire Burning up destroyed forever in the flames

She imagines Sandy sitting on her bed in the raging inferno
Ellie then sees one last image as she slips into blackness

ON BLACK

INT MS COLLINS’ LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 117A

Everything is on fire The photograph on the wall of young
Sandie looks out from the flames

We than MATCH CUT as-

SCENES 118-120 OMITTED

INT WAREHOUSE - NIGHT 121

The rectangle photograph of Sandie becomes a doorframe in
silhouette reminiscent of our opening image

Music starts - a dance remix of Petula Clark’s ‘Downtown’
blasting through this large cavernous space

A figure appears in the doorway the outline of Sandie
dressed as she was when we first met her in Cafe de Paris

The figure stalks towards us We feel strip lights blink on
and cameras flash behind her

ANNOUNCER
Now first year student Eloise
Turner

An entire audience of SHADOWY PEOPLE bursts into applause
The lights come up and we are looking at the happy audience
for a FASHION SHOW Peggy and John are right in the middle

clapping the hardest

From behind a mirrored wall THREE YOUNG MODELS strut down
the catwalk wearing designs that are the natural evolution of
Ellie’s college work The first is the dress inspired by
Sandie the second and third are completely modern

We see Ellie in the wings watching her work parade around
She beams proudly There is loud applause as the models loop
back to the backstage area A voice beams over the PA

ANNOUNCER (CONTD)
Eloise Turner

There’s now thunderous applause as Ellie walks out on stage
with her models surrounded by her designs Peggy and John
stand to clap as she soaks up this moment of triumph

The models file off stage and Ellie follows them

INT BACKSTAGE - CONTINUOUS 122

A proud Ms Tobin is waiting in the wings She wraps Ellie in
a celebratory hug

MS TOBIN
I knew you could do this even
after everything you’ve gone
through You’re a star Ellie

Ellie then follows her models back to a staging area Nearby

Cami and Lara are prepping their own models
Lara and Cami run over to Ellie

LARA

That was incredible You really are

so brave
CAMI
So brave You’re such an
inspiration
Ellie hugs both of them She moves on sees
Jocasta too Ashley applauds Ellie Jocasta
colder glance
Ellie totally brushes Jocasta off and moves
beaming with satisfaction As she does she
reflection in a large mirror But-
It’s not just her reflection in the mirror
When she looks again she sees behind her on
Her MUM Watching on A mixture of pride and
Ellie stares at her warm happy

but your mum would have been so
proud of you

Ellie smiles to herself

ELLIE
I know she is

Ellie turns back to the mirror but in the reflection is not
her mum It’s-

Young SANDIE Dressed as we first saw her Perfect

Ellie starts walking away from Peggy and John and towards the
mirror drawn to it

Ellie and Sandie are inches apart Blue flashing lights echo
around them both

Sandie smiles Ellie smiles They tap the glass together
