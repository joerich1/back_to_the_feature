Screenplay by Bo Goldman

EXT ANNANDALE-ON-HUDSON NY - 400 AM

A patch of water PULL BACK TO REVEAL more water BACK
FARTHER TO REVEAL an expanse of river up the bank to
massive lawn running up to a great classic Hudson River
manor house the country estate of William Parrish

INT PARRISH COUNTRY ESTATE - 400 AM

MOVE THROUGH French doors that lead from a wide terrace into
an expansive living room DOWN wide corridors lined with
Bierstadt and Cole paintings the Hudson River School mists
and trees and small boats and distant humans

INT PARRISH BEDROOM - 400 AM

MOVE THROUGH the doorway to reveal a master bedroom furnish-
ed with exquisite simplicity revelatory of its sleeping
occupant WILLIAM PARRISH 64 a warm but commanding face a
man of maturity yet who exudes a glow of enthusiasm

Although asleep there is an uncommon restlessness to him
Parrish grips his upper arm as if in pain Now the severity
of the pain wakes him he squeezes his arm The wind comes
up through the wind a VOICE is heard distantly or is it the
wind itself

VOICE (VO)
Yes

Parrish blinks has he heard something has he not he is
not sure he releases his arm his grimace of pain fades
the discomfort seems momentarily to have subsided

He rises now crosses to the bathroom As he pees a breeze
outside the window the wind again but then the Voice comes
up

VOICE (VO)
Yes

It is unmistakably a Voice it is not the wind Parrish has
heard something he looks around but no one is there He
cant finish peeing turns back to his bedroom All beweild-
ered Parrish looks around once more climbs back into bed
trying to trace the source of what he has heard or hasnt
heard he is not sure

He pulls the covers up now not a SOUND tries to close his
eyes

VOICE (VO)
Yes

Parrish sits up again frightened but still there is no one
there he seems fraught with indecision should he get up
should he not what is happening He looks out absolute
stillness and silence CRICKETS chirp down by the river a
light FLICKERS from a shadboat Parrish closes his eyes but
then they flutter open he glances up at the ceiling and
finally exhausted falls back asleep

Parrish Drew beside him proceeds through a high tech but
tasteful maze spiffy executive secretaries at burnished

despite his swift entrance

He passes through an open set of doors and he is into his
own suite commanded by JENNIFER his assistant

JENIFER
Good morning Mr Parrish

PARRISH
Hi Jennifer
Drew is still at Parrishs heels but now Parrish stops at

Jennifer acknowledges Drew with a smile rises and moves to
Parrishs doorway waiting for the days instructions but
Parrish only nods to the door and Jennifer quickly closes
it returns to her desk

INT PARRISHS OFFICE - DAY

Alone in his office Parrishs ebullient mood immediately
changes Leaning against the back of the couch he stares
out through floor-to-ceiling windows surveying the
Manhattan skyline cogitates

He takes a seat on the couch opens a folder suddenly he
flinches with a spasm of pain in his shoulder It is sharp
but brief he notices it but what it does not continue he
ignores it

Parrish resumes looking at the folder when suddenly the
pain comes again He reaches for his shoulder tries to
massage the pain it does not subside Parrish stands
trying to shake it off but it refuses to go away some-
thing is unmistakably wrong Now a SOUND which he has
come to recognize makes itself heard

VOICE (VO)
Yes

Frozen with surprise Parrishs eyes search the room for the
source of the SOUND it comes from no particular direction
yet surrounds him Suddenly Parrishs symptoms sharply
intensify he is sinking to the floor but somehow grabs a
corner of the desk holds on with one hand with the other
clutches at his shoulder and arm the pain has violently
seized the upper part of his body He breaks out in a sweat
his pallor now waxen as the Voice repeats itself

VOICE (VO contd)
Yes

Parrish grips the edge of the desk the pain assaulting him
on the one hand the Voice coming at him from the outer
each aberration feeds on the other he is beside himself
consumed with pain and bewildered by what seems to be a
hallucination but which he is certain is not Parrish is
possessed He angles his face in every direction arbi-
trarily chooses one and now embarrassedly unconsciously
enrage responds to the Voice

PARRISH
Yes what

VOICE
Yyes is the answer to your
question

PARRISH

I didnt ask any question

VOICE
I believe you did

Parrish is absolutely confounded seized up with pain and
consternation at this unseen Voice which has such presence
and reality

PARRISH
Who are you

Silence

PARRISH (contd)
Goddammit what is going on

VOICE
I think you know --

PARRISH

VOICE
Try Because if you havent tried
you havent lived
A moment

PARRISH
What are you talking about

VOICE
What you were talking about

Parrish gasps

PARRISH
What is this Who is this fucking
guy

He holds on tight to the corner of the desk sweat dripping
his skin ashen Now he addresses the Voice again searching
for it in another direction

PARRISH (contd)
Tell me who you are

VOICE
Are you giving me orders

PARRISH
Im sorry I --

VOICE
No youre not Youre trying to
handle the situation but this is
the one situation you knew you never
could handle

A spasm the worst one yet finally it subsides and there is
an eerie silence in the room a VOID almost more disturbing
than the voice that has filled it

PARRISH
Where are you Are you there

VOICE
Its enough now

PARRISH
Please Talk to me --

VOICE
Theres going to be plenty of time
for that

PARRISH
What do you mean

VOICE

PARRISH

(a moment)
Know what goddammit

The VOICE is gone Parrish searches the corner but the

room has lost the quality it had when it was inhabited by

the VOICE it is now just Parrishs office Faint SQUEALS of
traffic from the street then a KNOCK at the door

Parrish touches his shoulder the pain is gone but he is
still wet with sweat the KNOCK again Parrish straightens
himself up adjusts his tie runs his fingers through his
hair blinks as he addresses the door

her Now he turns and starts off in the opposite direction

ANOTHER ANGLE - SUSAN
She looks back at the Young Man then turns and walks on
ANOTHER ANGLE - THE YOUNG MAN

He looks back at Susan as the distance between them widens
now he turns and walks on

ON SUSAN

She looks around once more but the Young Man is still headed
in the opposite direction his back to her She turns the
corner and continues on

ON THE YOUNG MAN

Approaching the corner he looks back for Susan yet again
but she is gone still turned he steps off into the street
and a hospital supplies truck speeding down the curb lane

you think he should play

A stab of pain Parrish discreetly grabs his upper arm but
manages to keep his attention on Allison

PARRISH
Tell it to me again

Suddenly the Voice cuts in

VOICE (VO)
Yes

Parrishs head snaps startled by the SOUND

VOICE (VO contd)
(to Parrish)
Did you miss me

Parrish reacts once more aware again he is the only one who
has heard the Voice as an oblivious Allison continues

ALLISON
(to Parrish)
Never mind Leave it to me

Parrish ignores her his attention has been taken by the
Voice His eyelids flutter nonplused edgy and fearful

LUISA
Mr Parrish dinner is served

ALLISON
(to Quince and Drew
across the room)
Chow-time you guys

Parrish is confounded Blindly and disconcerted he follows
Allison and Drew and Quince

INT DINING ROOM - NIGHT

As a disturbed Parrish approaches the table he hears the
Voice once more

VOICE (VO)
What are you looking so provoked
about Did you miss me Its
a normal question I missed you
But what do I get back Not an
ounce of excitement not a whisper
of a thrill --

Parrish sits
VOICE (VO contd)
-- This relationship has all the

passion of a pair of titmice

Parrish is on the edge of his seat struggling to hide his
panic

VOICE (VO contd)
Im waiting outside

The conversation swirls on around Parrish he is deaf to it

ALLISON
(to D

rew)

Did you speak to the Governor

DREW
Hes coming

ALLISON
His wife
DREW
Unfortunately I sat between them

at the Bronx Zoo benefit -- it was
better than Seconal

VOICE (VO)
Im waiting outside Wont someone
come to the door

Parrish is in shock
himself As Coyle serves him Parrish turns to Luisa

still striving to gain control of

PARRISH
Is somebody waiting outside Luisa

LUISA

I didnt hear a ring sir

PARRISH
Please have a look --

Luisa goes as Coyle continues serving

on

ALLISON
(to Quince)
What about the Mayor

QUINCE
He said he would be there with bells

DREW

Good maybe theyll drown him out

Parrish is still not hearing a word preoccupied with the

return of Luisa

ALLIS

ON

Please dont be negative Drew we
have an acceptance list that would
do The White House proud -- The
Secretary-General of the UN the
Chairman of the FCC nine Senators
I dont know how many Congressmen
and at least twelve of the Fortune
500

QUINCE
No jocks A twenty-game winner or a
Masters champion Someone I could
talk to
(a moment)
Or would talk to me

Luisa returns to Parrish as the others conversation drones
on

LUISA
Youre right Mr Parrish There
was a gentleman at the door Hes
waiting for you in the foyer

Parrish is stunned

PARRISH
(after a moment)
Show him into the library tell him
Ill be right there

Parrish spinning with anxiety tries to summon up his courage
to go as Allison continues

ALLISON
Ive arranged for favors -- silver
charm bracelets for the women
platinum keychains for the men --
all engraved WP -- but now Im
thinking of scrubbing them they
seem so ordinary

Finally Parrish rises from the table starts out

ALLISON (contd)
Are they ordinary Do they seem
that way to you Daddy

PARRISH
Uh -- I dont know No - uh - I
dont

Allison is about to press the point but then drifts into
disappointed silence as Parrish leaves the room

DREW
(to Allison)
Youre overthinking it --

QUINCE
I dont think theyre ordinary I
love keychains

INT HALLWAY OUTSIDE LIBRARY PARRISH TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT

Parrish moves deliberately down the hall slows as he nears
the doorway to the library The door is open He hesitates
before he crosses the threshold taking in as much as his
eye can see now tentatively he enters

INT LIBRARY PARRISH TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT

A beautiful classic room areas of dim warm light club
chairs books reaching to the ceiling a rolling library
ladder a weathered dictionary on a stand a model boat
carved of bone set into the stacks which are separated from
the reading area by a seven-foot high partition of obscured
glass

Parrish poised in the doorway looks around nothing in
sight

PARRISH
Hello

Silence

PARRISH (contd)
Anyone here

No response

PARRISH (contd)
I said is anyone here

VOICE (VO)
Quiet down

Parrish is startled he shrinks backward for a moment his
eyes searching the room for the Voice the timbre and pitch
of which is exactly what he has heard before There is the
sense that someone is there but Parrish cannot see him and
he does not dare look

PARRISH
(quietly)

Where are you

VOICE (VO)
Im here

Now a flicker of a shadow from behind a corner of the obscured
glass the section of the room most distant from Parrish
there is a shape Something is there

PARRISH
What is this a joke right Some
kind of elaborate practical joke
At my 40th reunion we delivered a
casket to the Class presidents
hotel room and --

VOICE
Quiet

Parrish falls silent something in the SOUND and TONE of the
Voice muting him He takes a step backwards

VOICE (contd)
Where are you going

PARRISH
I - I - uh --

The shape moves makes itself more visible Although still
diffused by the glass the shape has definition a person a
man his features are not yet distinguishable but he is
there all right

VOICE
The great Bill Parrish at a loss for
words The man from whose lips fall
rapture and passion and obses-—
sionall those admonitions about
being deliberately happy what
there is no sense living your life
without all the sparks and
energy you give off the rosy advice
you dispense in round pear-shaped
tones --

PARRISH
What the hell is this Who are you

VOICE
Just think of millenniums multiplied
by aeons compounded by infinity
Ive been around that long but its
only recently that your affairs here
have piqued my interest Call it
boredom the natural curiosity of
me the most lasting and significant
element in existence has come to see
you

Parrish struggles to make sense of what he is hearing

PARRISH
About what

VOICE
I want to have a look around before
I take you

PARRISH
Take me Where

VOICE
It requires competence wisdom
experience -- all those things they
say about you in testimonials --
and youre the one

PARRISH
The one to do what

VOICE
Show me around Be my guide And
in return you get

PARRISH
(breathless)
Get what
VOICE
Time
PARRISH

What the hell are you talking about

VOICE
Watch it

PARRISH
Im sorry --

VOICE

In return youll receive minuets days
weeks Im not going to go into details

what matters is that I stay
interested

Parrish squints trying to make sense of what is happening
VOICE (contd)

Yes
PARRISH
Yes what
VOICE
Yyes is the answer to your ques-
tion
PARRISH

What question

VOICE
Bill Come on The question The
question youve been asking yourself
with increased regularity at odd
moments panting through the extra
game of handball when you ran for
the plane in Delhi when you sat up
in bed last night and hit the floor
in the office this morning The
question that is in the back of your
throat choking the blood to your
brain ringing in the ears over and
over as you put it to yourself --

PARRISH
The question --

VOICE
(urging)
Yes Bill The question

After a moment

PARRISH
-Am I going to die

The figure who is the Voice takes a step forward now no
longer obscured by the glass he comes into the light re-
vealing himself to be the Young Man seen previously in the
coffee shop but there is a change he seems odd off-
center not handsome but terrifyingly beautiful

YOUNG MAN
Yes

A moment Parrish beside himself He cannot bring himself
to speak finally
PARRISH
Am I dreaming this
(Another moment)
Are you a dream

YOUNG MAN
I am not a dream

PARRISH
Youre coming to take me What is
that Who the hell are you

The Young Man steps closer to Parrish his face is inches
from a shaking sweating Parrishs face the Young Man
daring Parrish to identify him

PARRISH
You are --
YOUNG MAN
(urging again)

Yes --

Parrish turns away But the Young Man spectacularly is in
front of him again

YOUNG MAN (contd)

(gently)
Who am I
PARRISH
Death

Parrish is shocked stunned terrified at the word by what
he has comprehended He surveys the Young Man who at this
moment actually seems bewildered by his effect

PARRISH (contd)
Youre Death

YOUNG MAN
Yes

PARRISH
Death

YOUNG MAN
Thats me

PARRISH

Youre not Death Youre just a kid
in a jacket and a pair of pants
YOUNG MAN
The jacket and the pair of pants
came with the body I took Let me
ask your opinion Do I blend in

A hopelessly confused Parrish does not respond for a moment

PARRISH
You want me to be your guide --

YOUNG MAN
You fill the bill Bill

PARRISH
I do
(a moment)
How long will you be staying

YOUNG MAN
You should hope quite a while

PARRISH
And then --

The Young Man nods gently

PARRISH (contd)
Its its over

A long silence Parrish and the Young Man take each other in
the sense that now they understand each other A SOUND at the
door

LUISA (0S)
Mr Parrish

Parrish does not hear her for the moment Luisa steps inside
the Library

LUISA (contd)
Will the gentleman be staying for
dinner sir

Parrish ignores her at first finally he looks at Luisa then
at the Young Man then once more at both of them as if to
verify the Young Mans presence has been acknowledged by
Luisa The Young Man interjects

YOUNG MAN
(to Luisa)
Yes
(a polite afterthought)
Thank you

Luisa nods perfunctorily and exits Parrish is frozen
dumbfounded

YOUNG MAN (contd)
(to Parrish)
Where is dinner

Parrish does not answer at first

PARRISH
This is crazy -- youre not going to
eat dinner with us

YOUNG MAN
Bill I am eating dinner with you
And your family And thats what
were doing Its not open for
discussion Nothing is Dont
you understand

Parrish is frightened by the response

YOUNG MAN (contd)
Good Now lead the way

Parrish hesitates then obediently leads the Young Man out
of the library down a long hallway and across the foyer

PARRISH
Excuse me Could I say something

YOUNG MAN
Of course
PARRISH
(quietly)

It just occurred to me --

YOUNG MAN
Speak up please

PARRISH
(louder)
When I introduce you if I say who
you are I dont think anyone will
stay for dinner

YOUNG MAN
Then dont
INT DINING ROOM - NIGHT

As Parrish and the Young Man enter Allison is heard in the
background

ALLISON
Well heres another possibility

this strike you Kaleidoscopes Little
gold kaleidoscopes Some German firm
went kerplunkt Tiffanys picked these
things up theyre perfect party favors
however theyre not personal theyre
winter scene or something snow-flakes
and dachshunds

Parrish and the Young Man appear at the table an awkward
pause ensues the unannounced guests presence at a family
dinner being noted and the guest himself carefully survey-
ed Finally Allison breaks the ice

ALLISON (contd)
(to the Young Man)
Hi there --

YOUNG MAN
Hello

Parrish is horribly uncomfortable as the Young Man looks at
each person as if he were discovering a face of the first
time

PARRISH
Uh -- sorry -- to have stepped away
for so long -- uh -- this is a
friend of mine I asked to drop by --
we got to talking and stuff -- uh --

Parrish drifts into another awkward pause

YOUNG MAN
(to Allison)

PARRISH
Oh Im sorry This is my daughter

PARRISH

DREW

PARRISH
(alarmed)

DREW

tumbles from his lips

PARRISH

At the kisss conclusion Susan suddenly notices Joe is
present and has been watching She is shocked embarrassed
pleased conflicted an instant and wide spectrum of emotions

Did your doctor say anything about
a tiny undetectable hole in your
aorta Did he mention an irreparab-
ly weak vein in the further reaches
of your famous brain Were they any

ilites of a fatal collision on a golf
cart of suffocating in an avalanche
on a skin vacation in Gstaad

PARRISH
No --

wonderment at the oddest things the handle on a casement
window the hem and weight of the fabric of a drape hinges
on the bedroom door In the process he opens this door
steps out into the hallway

Joe wanders down the hallway past the occasional Dufy or
Miro a Venetian tapestry cheek-by-jowl with a miniature
Ming vae and even a Bonsai garden with a trickling vein
of water

INT KITCHEN HALLWAY PARRISH TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT

In the back of the house now utilitarian paint and decor
the SOUND of laughter and a glare of light Joe enters

INT KITCHEN PARRISH TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT

The staff is at ease some smoking remains of food around

Coyle the butler has his back to Joe and does not see him

for a moment In front of Coyle an open jar of peanut but-
ter which he is spreading in generous hunks of Wonder Bread
Joe is fascinated by the process Coyle suddenly hears the

silence looks up and see Joe standing up embarrassedly

COYLE
Yes sir

JOE
Hello Im Joe Black Nice to meet

COYLE

Yes sir Mr Black a pleasure

The staff all mumble expansive Good evening sirs to Joe
He motions to them to sit they do but Coyle does not Coyle
shifts from foot-to-foot the staff is not used to having
Parrish family or guests in this part of the house

JOE
(to Coyle)

Coyle regards his peanut butter sheepishly

COYLE (contd)
Laura Scudders Peanut Butter

Joe nods Coyle fashions a spoonful offers it to Joe Joe
swallows it But he has not yet found a comfortable way of
masticating his mouth and tongue go every which way the
staff observes him fascinated

COYLE (contd)
Youre a peanut butter man now eh

JOE
Yes I am I thoroughly enjoyed

ful Goodnight Mr Blacks his tongue again licking the
edges of the spoon

Speedo suit Joe wanders in still licking his peanut butter
He observes her but she is unaware of him however now as
she makes a barrel turn his shadow falls over a reflection
from a window she aborts her lap looks up to see who it is

SUSAN
What are you doing here

JOE
Im lost

SUSAN
-- Cant seem to escape you today

JOE
Im sorry

Susan climbs out of the pool gets halfway up the ladder
points to a stack of towels

SUSAN
Hand me one of those will you

Joe turns to the towels but one hand is occupied with the
spoonful of peanut butter he shifts it to the other hand
cant manage the huge Turkish towel one-handed now implants
the spoon in his mouth lifts the towel with both hands and
presents it to Susan

hand out to him he places the spoon in it and she sets the
spoon on the table with the towels She watches fascinat-
ed as Joe licks his gums enjoying every last bit of his
spoonful

drops of water pats them dry hands her the towel She
flashes a nervous smile

Joe is completely puzzled finally Susan heads for one door
Joe for another

Joe redirects himself goes to the door As they both are
about to exit Joe and Susan sneak furtive looks at each
other across the pool smile at catching each others
glances Joe exits For a moment Susans eyes remain on

Parrish seems relieved He has now with some difficulty
completed the tying of Joes tie adjusts it beautifully on
Joes collar then spins him around in front of a mirror
Joe catching sight of his own appearance rises to the
balls of his feet quite taken

JOE (contd)
This is great
(a moment)
Now what do we do

PARRISH
Shake hands

Joe immediately extends his hand toward Parrish but

Parrish freezes on seeing the hand stares at it now takes
it Joe pumps Parrishs hand vigorously then breaks into a
broad smile

EXT 5TH AVENUE NEW YORK CITY - DAY

Parrish and Joe striding downtown Joes jacket fits per-
fectly he blends right in and he clearly enjoys being part
of the smart Fifth Avenue crowd on the way to work Parrish
senses Joes pleasure his slight preening his eyes check-
ing out the good-looking women headed for the offices at the
top of corporate high-rises

PARRISH
You know I got to thinking last
night -- with you here and seem-

ingly occupied hows your work

A flicker from Joe He has heard what Parrish has said his
eyes busy with the grift and the sparkle of the Avenue but
he is concentrating on Parrishs words

JOE
When you were shaving this morning
you werent just shaving right
PARRISH
What do you mean

JOE
You were hatching ideas making
plans arriving at decisions right

PARRISH
I guess so

JOE
So you understand the concept then
When youre busy here your work
what your task is is being executed
elsewhere

PARRISH
Of course

JOE
So youve grasped the idea Con-
gratulations Now multiply it by
infinity and take it to the depth
of forever and you still will
have barely a glimpse of what I
am talking about

Parrish falls silent chewing over Joes admonition

PARRISH
Joe --

JOE
Yes Bill

PARRISH

How about giving a guy a break

JOE
Make an exception

PARRISH
Theres one to every rule

JOE
Not this

They stride on cutting through the crowd Joe all at home
in his new surrounding but Parrish just the opposite un-
characteristically uncomfortable phrases forming on his
lips but unspoken then suddenly he blurts out
PARRISH
-- I dont deserve this Im still
young this is not my time --

JOE
Thats what everybody says

PARRISH
Im not everybody

JOE
Thats what everybody says

Parrish is trying to control himself glances at Joe

PARRISH
I want to live

JOE

A moment

JOE (contd)

to have stopped slightly the courage he displayed at rais-
ing these issues has vanished

JENIFER

Jennifer wheels and heads right back to the office as
Parrish arrives at the door to the Board Room

PARRISH
(to Joe)
Perhaps you would like to wait in my
office --

JOE
No

PARRISH
What Im trying to say is this is a
Board meeting and you are not a mem-
ber of the Board

JOE
Im sure youll see to it that it
wont be a problem

Parrish hesitates nods conceding the point reaches for
the doorknob

INT BOARD ROOM PARRISH COMMUNICATIONS - DAY

Parrish enters Joe following right behind him A euphony
of Good mornings from the various members of the Board
including Quince Everyone sits when Parrish does but Joe
right at home spots a tray of refreshments coffee pas-
tries he heads for them

PARRISH
(to the Board)
-- This is Joe Black a personal
associate of mine - uh - hell be
joining us today I know its --
uh -- unusual and my apologies --
and Drew -- uh -- carry on

Immediately indications of surprise on Board members faces
Parrish bringing in an observer Drews reaction guarded

at
but intense

DREW
(after a moment to
Joe)
Nice to see you I didnt expect
you but certainly you cant get
enough of a good thing

JOE
Thank you

DREW
(to the Board)
The Board of Parrish Communications -
is hereby called to order Our sole
order of business is an acceptance
of John Bontecous generous offer
and --

JOE
(to Drew)

Do you have any more of these deli-
cious cookies

A hushed silence at the inappropriateness of Joes inter-
ruption

JOE (contd)
And a cup of tea With milk I
think Id like to try it English-
style Yes a cup of tea with milk

DREW
Anything else Mr Black How about
some water

JOE
Why yes thank you

DREW
Hot or cold

JOE
Cold

DREW
And a glass

Drew indicates to the Boards Stenographer to arrange Joes
refreshments
PARRISH
(quietly indicating a
chair)
Would you like to sit down Joe

JOE
Yes
Joe sits
DREW
To review -- were really crossing

the ts and dotting the is here
Bill had a great and conclusive
meeting with John Bontecou yester-
day all that remains for us is to
put it to a vote

Smiles and murmurs of a congratulatory receptiveness from
the Board at Drews news

PARRISH
(emptily)
Thank you Drew

Parrish takes a moment draws himself up to say something
official then stops himself what follows is spontaneous

reflective deeply felt

PARRISH (contd)

Umm -- I did enjoy -- or rather I
was interested in meeting John yes-
terday -- impressive I suppose

But it did get me to thinking I
started in this business because
this is what I wanted to do I knew
I wasnt going to write the Great
American Novel but I also knew
there was more to life than buying
something for a dollar and selling
it for two I wanted to give the
news to the world and I wanted to
give it unvarnished The more we
all know about each other the
greater the chance we will survive
Sure I want to make a profit you
cant exist without one but John
Bontecou is all profit If we give
him license to absorb Parrish
Communications and he has his eye
on a few others after us well be
appointing him to the position he
craves -- Gatekeeper In order to
reach the world you will have to go
through John Bontecou And not only
will you have to pay him to do this
far more expensive youll have to
agree with him Reporting the news
is a privilege and a responsibility
and it is not exploitable Parrish
Communications has earned this priv-
ilege John Bontecou wants to buy
it As your chairman I urge you to
agree this company is not for sale

A silence everybody shifts the Board is in shock Drew
trying to maintain his balance

DREW
(carefully)
Sounds like youre not leaving
much room for discussion

PARRISH
(to the Board)
Sorry I know it looks like Im
reversing my field

DREW
Thats your privilege Bill But
given our needs given the absolute
necessity for growth given the fu-
ture the truth is joining John
Bontecou is every bit as certain as -
Death and Taxes

Joe interjects

JOE
Death and Taxes

After a moment

DREW
Yes

JOE
Death and Taxes

Another moment

DREW
Yes
JOE
What an odd pairing

DREW
Its just a saying Mr Black

JOE
Of whom

DREW
It doesnt matter

JOE
Then why did you bring it up

Drew regards Joe

DREW
Youre not familiar with the phrase
In this world nothing is certain
but Death and Taxes

PARRISH
I am now

DREW
Glad I could be of some help

The Board is provoked and mystified by Joe and even more by
his presence they cast meaningful glances at Parrish Drew
coolly grasps the irritation of the members Parrish breaks
the silence

PARRISH
Shall we adjourn

DREW
But the matters still on the table
Bill --

EDWARD SLOANE a contemporary of Parrishs has been warily
silent but extremely observant Protective of Parrish and
sensing his burgeoning difficulty he interrupts

SLOANE
Why dont we let it rest for the
moment Give it some air

PARRISH
Well said Eddie Mr Black shall
we
Joe rises

JOE
(to Drew)
Those cookies were excellent

He exits with Parrish the door closes behind them A BABBLE

She had on this little blue suit --
with a little white collar that had
little red piping on it --

Joe is riveted on Parrish ow Parrish aware of him has
paused

PARRISH (contd)

You could have put her under glass
and I would have just stood and
looked at her But when she spoke
-- I loved the sound of her voice
and her laugh --

(a moment)
-- I couldnt get enough of her --
and gradually -- or maybe it wasnt
gradually -- I realized I couldnt
live without her
A KNOCK the door opens and Drew enters looks at
then at Joe stands poised in the doorway

(glances at Joe)
I was hoping we might be alone

Bill
PARRISH
Joe and I have no secrets from each
other
DREW
(to Joe)

How nice for you both
Drew takes a moment then plunges in

DREW (contd)
Bill pardon my candor but I was
confounded by your decision this
morning

PARRISH
Why

DREW
I was hired you told me to help
bring Parrish Communications into
the 21st Century This merger is
the vehicle --

Joe interrupts

JOE

Parrish
Drew

Perhaps a merger is a way to bring
Bills company into the 21st cen-
tury And perhaps it isnt And
perhaps cheating on your French
Philosophers exam at The Groton
School was an expedient way to get
your diploma and perhaps it wasnt
Be that as it may Drew a question
can often be argued both ways

is stunned

PARRISH
Joe cut it out And you too Drew

DREW
(to Parrish)
I thought this was practically a
done deal --

PARRISH
Well now its undone okay Forget
Bontecou Scrub him Im tired of
his fancy name and his fancy offer
Im not going for it

A moment

DREW
Okay

Drew heads for the door turns around

DREW (contd)

(to Parrish)
Can I invite myself to dinner
tonight

(a moment)
Susan and I had ticket for the
Knicks game But she said you
guys were getting together --

PARRISH
Dinner Absolutely

JOE
Absolutely

DREW

(to Joe)
Damn decent of you
Drew exits

JOE
Why at this juncture are you
letting yourself be so concerned
by business matters

PARRISH

I dont want anybody buying up my

lifes work and turning it into
something it wasnt meant to be

A

man wants to leave something behind
And he wants it left behind the way
he made it And he wants it to be
run the way he run it -- with a sense
of honor of dedication of truth

Okay

JOE
Okay

PARRISH

And I dont need your goddamn permis-—
sion either You Drew I dont
need anyone to tell me how to run my

life

JOE

Easy Bill Youll give yourself a
heart attack and ruin my vacation

SUSAN (contd)
So youre not going to tell me

Joe remains silent rendered extremely anxious by Susans
inquiries

by Susan

SUSAN (contd)

Susan takes another step closer to Joe

stairs

SUSAN

To bed
SUSAN
(suddenly fragile)
To bed
JOE
Yes Im tired

He excuses himself with an ineffable gesture now climbs the
stairs Susan watches him disappear

She turns back into the salon just as Allison and Quince are

exiting good-byes all around

Susan is left alone now

with Parrish who is fixing a drink at a sidebar

PARRISH
That was wonderful

SUSAN

Yeah its good to get together

PARRISH

Do you mind if I raise a little

caution flag

SUSAN
Raise away

PARRISH

What is the nature of your interest

in Joe

SUSAN

Well remember how you told me about

lightning striking

The nature of

Parrish drops another cube of ice in his drink takes his

time before answering

PARRISH

I wont say you may be getting onto

shaken ground --
SUSAN
Then what will you say

PARRISH
I dont think this is the lightning
you are looking for Drews a good
man I know I didnt seem to be
completely in his corner before but
Ive come to appreciate --

SUSAN
Now we love Drew and Joe in verbo-
ten Whats going on

PARRISH

PARRISH
Then what is it

SUSAN

She kisses him

SUSAN (contd)
Gnight Daddy See you tomorrow

She goes
CUT TO
INT THE CARLYLE HOTEL - NEXT DAY

A large suite room service carts creaking with pots of
coffee and half-eaten pastries The Board of Parrish
Communications is gathered absent are Parrish and Quince
Felicia Drews secretary takes notes

DREW
I know youre all as uncomfor-
table as I am to be meeting without
Bill but I got a call last night
from John Bontecou Not only is he
still interested he is sweetening
his offer
(a moment)
Although it pains me to say it in
my opinion Bill Parrish dealt with
us peremptorily in dismissing any
deal with Bontecou Therefore Im
sorry to say that if we are to exam-
ine this new offer responsibly as
the Board of Directors of Parrish
Communications we must do so with-
out its Chairman

(another moment)
Oh yes there is one additional
element Bontecou is so anxious to
get us he said hed take Parrish
Communications with our Chairman or
without

The Board falls silent Sloane a peer of Parrishs
fidgets Drew milks the moment

DREW (contD)
Its no surprise if I suggest to you
that the Bill Parrish we know is not
the Bill Parrish you saw yesterday
You heard that speech -- some strange
emotional rationale to buttress a
knee-jerk rejection of a legitimate
offer Does it not strike you that
something is possibly affecting this
mans judgement More specifically
-- his judgement to make a critical
business decision

Silence the Board clocking Drews argument

DREW (contD)
Its not pleasant to say the follow-
ing but I would be remiss in this
crisis if I did not When we pre-
sent Bill with the improved Bontecou
offer and if he refuses to let us

consider it -- once more makes an
adamant or emotional rejection -- we
will have no choice but to seek an
alternative

SLOANE

And what would that be

DREW
Bills birthday is the day after
tomorrow There is a provisory by-
law in our charter Per the discre-
tion of the Board Corporate off-
icers can be retired at age sixty-
five

SLOANE
Youre taking this too far Drew

DREW
Am I not obligated to

Drew leans over to Felicia speaks quietly and she leaves
the room

DREW (contd)
How did this all come about Crisis
-- Bill Parrish crisis -- his com-
pany crisis for us I came about
with the arrival on the scene of --
Mr Joe Black Mr Joe who Joe
Black He attends our Board meet-
int he sleeps at Bills house re-
sides in his office Never leaves
his side And in my opinion is
always in his ear Telling him what
to do and Bill is listening Who is
Joe Black What is his relationship
to Bill Parrish And most important
what is behind his influence on our
Chairman

SLOANE
Youre building this thing up too
much Drew Hes had advisors be-
fore Nobody tells Bill what to do

The door opens and Felicia enters followed by Quince sur-
prised at seeing a convened Board but still he is all smiles

DREW
Thank you for coming

SLOANE
Hello Quince

QUINCE
Hi Ed hi folks I didnt know
everybody was going to be here what
a nice surprise Whats the big
confab

SLOANE
(acidly)
This is a secret meeting

DREW

(to Quince)
I hope youll respect its nature --
What were trying to do here is
gather our thoughts -- in light of
Bills rejection of Bontecous offer
-- and make an appropriate presenta-
tion to him as to how we think the
company might proceed Wont you
share with our Board the information
you gave me last night

Quince hesitates then realizes what Drew has on his mind
He nods confidently to Drew then turns importantly to the
Board

QUINCE
Well Im happy to tell you Ive got
good news As I was telling Drew
Ive been making a little hay while
the Bontecou sun was shining -- two
possibly three new and boiling hot
prospects for merger

DREW
How did Bill react to the leads
youve developed

QUINCE
He was interested

DREW
(prompting)
-- But he was concerned about the
timing

QUINCE
The timing -- yes He says its up
to Joe

DREW
Its up to Joe

QUINCE
Thats what he said

Quince having dispensed his information looks proudly
around at the Board members They are stunned Sloane in
shock Drew is absolutely still letting Quinces words
sink in
INT DINING ROOM PARRISH TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT

Parrish Joe Susan Allison and Quince are seated at the
table dessert plates in front of them coffee cups beside
Allison and Susans eyes are on Parrish looking for some
clue as to why has he gathered the family together yet

PARRISH

QUINCE

Quince puts a reassuring arm around Allison she seems to
relax now Joe has been a keen observer of what has trans-
pired between husband and wife between man and woman a
sense that he has taken in the virtue of such a relation-
ship

INT SALON PARRISH TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT

After dinner Parrish Allison and Susan are gathered to-
gether At the bar on the other side of the room Joe
watches as Quince pours himself a stiff hooker of brandy

JOE
(to Quince)
Cirrhosis of the liver is the fifth

JOE
On the other hand Winston Churchill

hard to figure maybe

JOE
And youre a nice man Quince

QUINCE
Thanks

JOE
Youre welcome
ANOTHER ANGLE

Drew appears unannounced in the doorway exchanges a tense
glance with Susan then heads straight for Parrish who seems
surprised to see him

DREW
(to Parrish)
Sorry to intrude Bill but weve
got a bit of a crisis downtown --
its not something we could talk
about on the phone

Parrish takes Drew aside

DREW (contd)
The Boards real unhappy Pappy --
they felt you dealt with them pre-
emptorily you never gave them a
chance to speak --

PARRISH
What is there to say They know
what John Bontecou is -- and if they

didnt they know now

DREW
Yes you made your feeling abun-
dantly clear Now they want to do
the same with theirs

PARRISH
What are their feelings

DREW
If I read this Board right now they
want you to accept Bontecous offer

PARRISH
Over my dead body

Parrishs burgeoning anger has now gotten the attention of
Joe Susan Quince and Allison

DREW
What do you think the Board is going
to say when I tell them that

PARRISH
I dont care
DREW
With all due respect you damn well
better care because if you try to
stonewall them again therell be
blood on the floor

Silence Parrish carefully calibrating Drews remark

PARRISH
Whose

DREW
Yours

PARRISH

Im feeling real uncomfortable right
now because the guy who reports to
me is threatening me

DREW
Im just giving you the truth There
was a time when William Parrish liked
the truth

Joe although across the room is all attention

PARRISH
I think its time you went home
Drew

DREW

Certainly Goodnight

Drew goes everybody is in shock Susan pursues him out into
the hallway

SUSAN
Drew

He stops

SUSAN (contd)
Never talk to my father like that
again

DREW
Dont worry about it Theres a
beginning and a middle and an end
to everything And I think Ive
come to the end of my chapter with
the Parrishes
Joe has followed them into the hallway

DREW (contd)
And the end began with this guy

Drew looks down towards Joe

DREW (contd)
Mr Black -- We ran a check on you
and you know what we came up with

JOE
No I dont --

DREW
Not good not bad you know what we
got Nothing No credit no cars
no mortgages -- no wives Nothing

Joe waits

DREW (contd)
All of a sudden a guy appears on the
scene with the Chairman of one of
the greatest communications corpora-
tions of the world the boss makes
him privy to all the companys
secrets he attends the Board meet-
ings and us working stiffs with
MBAs up the ass and years and years
and years of experience were left
outside with our noses pressed
against the window

Joe doesnt respond

DREW (contd)
This is a big-time operation deal-
ing in big-time issues demanding
big-time executives who make big-
time decisions So Joe why dont
you tell me exactly what it is
thats big time about you

After a moment

JOE
You first
SUSAN
(to Drew)

Why dont you get off his case
DREW
Oh youre the great Joes attorney
now Are we going to go to court
Or are we going to go to bed And I
dont mean you and me I mean you
and him

SUSAN
Thats it Its over Get out

DREW

So I guess a blowjobs out of the
question

Joe clears his throat

DREW (contd)
Did you say something

Joe considers him evenly

JOE
Almost

SUSAN
(to Drew)
I said get out

Now Drew wheels heads right for the front door and exits with
a SLAM

JOE
What an angry fellow

A moment passes before Susan realizes she and Joe are alone
and Joe does as well

SUSAN
Im sorry about --

JOE
Please We dont need to talk about
Drew

She regards Joe

SUSAN
No We dont

They drift osmotically into the library in awkward silence
SUSAN (contd)
Brave you had a chance to look at
Dads rare books Jeffersons
Parliamentary Manual a first
edition Bleak House --

Joe comes closer takes a deep breath

JOE
I love your smell

SUSAN
-- I guess you havent

Now Susan close to Joe leans closer her nose in Joes
neck Joe holds himself very still

SUSAN (contd)
I like your smell too

JOE
Thank you

SUSAN
It was everything

Silence the TICKING of the clock

SUSAN (contd)
When I was little my mother used to
say Darling you could set your
heart by this clock

JOE
-- Could you

SUSAN
Never tried til now
(suddenly)
Joe may I kiss you

JOE
Why yes Thank you

A moment

SUSAN
Youre welcome

Susan reaches out for Joe they kiss he is awkward but his
very awkwardness endearing Susan pulls him closer they
linger now mouths on each others then separate
SUSAN (contd)
Thank you

JOE
Youre welcome

The clock TICKS on A sense of foreboding falls over Joes
face his fear that he is passing through some barrier a
point of no return

SUSAN
Joe

The apprehensive expression on Joes face fades away

JOE
Yes

SUSAN
I dont know who you are

JOE
WellIm -- uh Joe And youre
Susan And I - uh - have this weak
feeling in my knees --

SUSAN
And is your heart beating strangely

JOE
Faster And I want the scent from
underneath your ears and the taste
of your lips and the touch of your
tongue to stay with me -- forever

An intake of breath She is about to speak
JOE (contd)
And you dont even have to say a
word

Their faces inches from each others

SUSAN
I have to go home

But neither Susan nor Joe moves

SUSAN (contd)
Dont I
Her question makes Joe almost involuntarily smile Susan
takes the opportunity to step back from him The SOUND of
someone at the door it is Parrish Susan turns comprehends
immediately how the situation will appear to him

SUSAN
Goodnight Daddy

She drifts right past him exits Joe and Parrish are left
alone now eyes on each others

JOE
Hello Bill

PARRISH
(carefully)
Hello Would you like to join me
Quince and Allison for a nightcap

JOE
Um -- not right now

An awkward moment

PARRISH
Okay Goodnight

JOE
Goodnight

Parrish turns and exits Joes head inclines he breathes in
the scent of his collar

CuT TO
INT EXECUTIVE SUITE PARRISH COMMUNICATIONS - NEXT DAY

Parrish followed by Joe emerges from his private elevator
is greeted as usual

JENIFER
Good morning Mr Parrish

PARRISH
Good morning Jennifer

JENIFER
The Board is waiting

PARRISH
What
JENIFER
Didnt you call a Board meeting

Jennifer sees Parrish is trying to right his balance she
knows better than to press the point

JENIFER (contd)
Yes the members are waiting They
are in the Board room now

Jennifer nods respectfully as Parrish doesnt cast a flicker
of any further surprise heads straight for the Board room
Joe right beside him

INT BOARD ROOM PARRISH COMMUNICATIONS - DAY

Parrish and Joe enter the entire Board is assembled includ-
ing Drew Quince and Sloane

PARRISH
Good morning

An odd mixture of responses the Board sheepish and at the
same time looking their most dutiful at this odd meeting
its sudden convening clearly a problem for Parrish a prob-
lem which he does not attempt to hide only control

DREW
Did you want to have a cup of coffee
or something Bill

PARRISH
I dont think so Do you

Drew gets the message at the same time Joe is checking out
all the attendees his eyes come to rest on Drew

DREW
(to Parrish)

To get to the point we have re-
ceived new information from John
Bontecou concerning his desires for
this company to merge with his and
we wanted to set the details before
you

A moment as Parrish looks around the moment extends it
appears he may not ever answer

PARRISH
Thats it
DREW
Bontecou wants a quick response

and --

PARRISH
The answer is no quick enough for
you

DREW

Dont you want to hear the details

PARRISH
Im not interested in the details
And Im not interested in the big
picture either What I am inter-
ersted in is how my Board got conven-
ed behind my back is entertaining a
further proposal from a man whom it
offends me to do business with
moreover has the audacity to present
this to me like a prize fish and I
am expected to clap for it like a
performing seal No thank you

DREW
So I am to understand from your re-
sponse that you do not want to hear
the details of Bontecous offer

PARRISH
Yes you are to understand that and
now may I ask you a question

DREW
Certainly Bill

PARRISH
Are you running this Board or am I

Sloane leans in

SLOANE
Were not getting anywhere here
Why dont we take some of the best
out of this thing lets consider
it coolly lets take a week --

DREW
Bontecou wants a speedier response
than that

SLOANE
Hell wait --

PARRISH
Doesnt need to Today tomorrow
a week from now -- a week from
now who can think about a week
from now -- the answer is going to
be the same -- a loud unmistakable
all-inclusive airtight -- No

A BUZZ amongst the Board they finally rustle into

under Parrishs withering glance

PARRISH (contd)
Thats it Ive got a busy day
and this meeting has already set
me behind Shall we adjourn

DREW
Before we do while were here
there is a second question the
Board would like a response to
a far simpler one

Parrish waits
DREW (contd)
Who is the man sitting to the right

of you

Everybodys eyes are on Joe

PARRISH
Ive already introduced Mr Black to
you all

DREW

But who is he What are his creden-
tials What is his relationship to
you

No response from Parrish

DREW (contd)
The feeling of the Board is this we
fear Mr Black is not only influenc-
ing your decisions in regard to this
company but that you are relying on
him to make them for you

silence

Quince flinches at these words his hands clasped in front

of him his knuckles white as Parrish regards Drew

but still
does not answer

DREW (contd)
The lack of response Bill is not
appropriate We are your Board we
have a right to know how you are
managing the operations of this
company and most importantly that
you have not delegated someone to do
it for you

Parrish squirms desperately uncomfortable but still does
not speak

DREW (contd)
Okay one more time

Drew regards Joe

DREW (contd)
Who is Joe Black

Parrish stares stoically into the middle distance as
Quinces head sinks into his hands

DREW (contd)
(to the Board)
A motion has been brought before
the Board to invoke Article 19 of
the corporate charter

PARRISH
In English please

DREW
Mandatory retirement upon our
Chairmans sixty-fifth birthday

Parrish is expressionless

DREW (contd)
At which time the Chairman will be
named Emeritus he will be welcome
to attend all meetings and will
serve as International Spokesman for
the corporation plus of course a
settlement a golden parachute of
such magnitude that his feet will
never touch the ground

Drew pauses
DREW (contd)
Please indicate your vote by a Yes
or No

A Yes is heard now another Yes now more Yeses all
reluctant No from Sloane No from Quince who realizes
he is the instrument of Parrishs dismissal

DREW (contd)
The motion is passed We will of
course delay the announcement out
of respect for our former Chairman
until after the celebration of his
birthday this weekend

PARRISH
Thank you for allowing me to save
face Drew

Joes eyes are riveted on Drew

DREW
(to the Board)
The other motion before us is the
acceptance of John Bontecous offer
to merge this corporation with
Bontecou International --

Parrish stands Drew stops speaking

PARRISH
Joe

Silence then Joe rises

JOE
(to the Board)
Who I am and my relationship to
Bill will be divulged in our own
good time

Joe follows Parrish out of the room

Quince falls silent aquiver with this reality

QUINCE

DREW
Quince you cant unscramble

QUINCE

DREW
The trains left the station pal
and youre aboard Would you like

that gold Ive been working with
John Bontecou all along We had

a game plan -- acquire Parrish
Communications then break it apart
and peddle it piece-by-piece to the
highest bidder I set it up for
him he smacks it out of the park

Quince is struck dumb

DREW (contd)
Dont you know what thisll mean
Youll be rich Youll sell your
stock you can stop kissing ass --
Whatll it feel like to be a man

QUINCE
I dont want to get rich this way --
Im going to expose you

DREW
Go right ahead Tell William
Parrish how you betrayed him at
a secret Board meeting And tell
Allison how you got her father
fired -- and he lost his company

Quince goes ashen

DREW (contd)
Its just life Quin-cee

Drew hails an employee across the hall

DREW (contd)
(to Quince)
Wake up and smell the thorns

Drew joins the employee as Quince slumps against the wall
INT FOYER PARRISH TOWNHOUSE - DAY

Parrish enters Joe right behind him Coyle takes their coats
disappears Parrish hesitates for a moment shrugs as if he
has a thought he doesnt want to share then heads upstairs
with Joe He is trudging a bit Joe senses his mood

JOE
Im sorry Bill --

PARRISH
Thats okay
JOE
Whats okay

PARRISH
Just a manner of speaking

Joe seems puzzled

PARRISH
(contd)
What okay is its okay its
over Weve got bigger fish to fry
dont we Joe

JOE
Fish

PARRISH
Never mind Im tired Im going
to take a nap

A moment

PARRISH (contd)
Are you hungry Coyle will have
Luisa fix you something to eat

JOE
Im not hungry

PARRISH
Then I cant help you

Parrish turns into his bedroom closing the door gently
behind him Joe continues down the hall enters the guest
wing

INT GUEST SUITE PARRISH TOWNHOUSE - DAY

Midday sunlight streams into the sitting room Joe passes
through to his bedroom sits tentatively on the bed feels
the edge of the silk spread touches the pillow then rises
again crosses back to the sitting room

Susan appears in the doorway Joe suddenly senses her turns
around

SUSAN
Youre here

JOE
I am
He stands they regard each other for the moment

JOE (contd)
May I take your coat

She doesnt answer starts to take off the coat herself Joe
comes around her to help Susan senses him breathing in the
scent at the back of her neck

SUSAN
I just thought Id drop by scrounge
a little lunch I was in the neigh-
borhood --

JOE
How beautiful

He starts to hang Susans coat up

SUSAN
Just throw it on the chair

Joe holds her coat carefully on the chair An awkward
moment the two of them shifting from foot-to-foot

SUSAN (contd)
When I called they said that you
and Daddy had just left the office

JOE
Hes taking a nap

SUSAN
He must be tired -- this Bontecou
thing --

JOE

Yes hes tired I believe so
A moment

JOE (contd)
You must be hungry

Susan sits on the couch

SUSAN
No not anymore Are you

Joe hears the question but doesnt answer sits down on the
couch beside her
SUSAN (contd)
(after a moment)
Are you cold

JOE
-No
SUSAN
Maybe its the draft through the
door

She gets up closes the door sits back down again next to
Joe A warm awkward silence they move closer to each
other now they fall into a foreplay which Susan recognizes
as such Joe on the other hand participates hungrily but
has no knowledge where it is leading His movements are
instinctive the smell of her hair the shape of her fin-
gers odd things about her seem to interest him This
excites her because she senses his untutoredness and the
very sense of that stirs her their reactions to each other
are intuitive and spontaneous even though Joe has no know-
ledge of how to make love to a woman ironically his actions
are such that they never beg the question -- has he done it
before

Strange territory for Joe not to be in control and exert-—
ing his power but his inventions and responses in lovemak-
ing are so real that an emotional exchange between he and
Susan builds Joe has found himself in an unexplored land

of feeling and passion he loves what is happening and yet

at the same time is terrified by it He feels himself being
lured by some power he has not only never been aware of but
is deeply dangerous to partake of he knows what he is doing
is putting who he is at great risk yet he goes right on

The powerful contradiction is transmitted to Susan and in
the end there is the knowledge they have together made a
journey they both have been swept away in a stream of events
they have created and they dont care about the consequences

Spent they lie in silence Finally Susan speaks

SUSAN
Its so wonderful to make love to
you Its like making love to some-
one who has never made love before

Joe senses an opportunity not only to admit to what she has
said but to tell her more even the truth about himself

He weighs then resists the impulse

JOE
Thank you

Her head nestles underneath his arm she has a sense of his
comforting her without knowing that he is doing so

SUSAN
Did you like making love to me

JOE
I loved it

SUSAN
More than you love peanut butter

JOE
Yes

She laughs at the earnestness with which he answers

Joe seems to drift away now they lie together as one but for
the first time she feels separate from him sensing him gone
to some distant distant land

SUSAN
Where are you going

JOE
Nowhere Imhere

SUSAN
For how long

JOE
Oh I hope a long long time

A moment
SUSAN
Me too
Another moment
JOE

What do we do now

She smiles

SUSAN
It will come to us

with the rush hour crowd trapped in the life of the city
he peers intently at faces cars into store windows He
stops now at the window of a Korean grocery something has
caught his eye he steps inside

Through the window Joe can be seen making a purchase he
hands the Korean Clerk some money walks out

Clerk runs out after him

Joe tries to hand the money back but the baffled Clerk
refuses it

Zee coming in now over the great lawns and old estates of
the Upper Hudson Valley down towards Annadale-on-Hudson
and the Parrish country estate which commands a beehive of
activity tents and workmen and vehicles

EXT PARRISH COUNTRY ESTATE - AFTERNOON

The Parrish AStar sets down in its roped-off landing area
The Butler runs towards it to open the door Parrish and

Joe disembark Following the Butler they make their way
through the maelstrom tents being raised platforms for
music groups portable pools with clusters of florists
leaning over the edge to arrange lily pads within Parrish
and Joe move solemnly observing the activity not speaking
to one another Although they are shoulder-to-shoulder
there is a distance between them They walk on past chan-
deliers in the garden and fake trees with lights woven
through their branches Adding to the confusion the AStar
lifts off the chandeliers rocking and floral pools rippling
from the blast of the rotors May the housekeeper appears

MAY
(to Parrish)
Telephone call sir Mr Sloane
from New York

Parrish nods starts up for a wing off the main house Joe
right at his side Parrish stops

EXT LAWNS COUNTRY ESTATE - AFTERNOON

Allison is everywhere Parrish emerges from his wing she
catches his eye immediately the calm director of a DeMille-
like epic politely giving workers instructions making
lightning decisions

Parrish turns his attention now to an ice-filled fountain
encircling two giant topiary letters written in faux-
Cyrillic a B anda P as rubber-booted delivery men
carefully arrange giant ice chests of caviar under each
letter A smile creases Parrishs face as in an unexpected
lull Allison backs into him at the fountain

ALLISON
Hi Daddy what do you think

PARRISH
ts starting to grow on me But
what do the B and P mean

ALLISON

The fountain is the Caspian Sea and
the Sea is serving up caviar The
Bs for Beluga the P for
Petrossian Of course they also
stand for Bill and for Parrish

fq

PARRISH
Do they mdear

ALLISON

-- Plus weve got a baritone with a
balalaika coming from The Russian
Tea Room Ive dressed him in a
Cossack shirt and hell sing Nelson
Eddy songs

Parrish shakes his head

PARRISH
You are amazing Why oh why
Allison are you doing all this

But before she can answer a workman is tugging at Allisons
sleeve she turns away from Parrish to give him instructions
out of Parrishs earshot and then turns back they step away
now daughter and father alone

ALLISON
I do it because I love you Because
everybody I loved you Mommy -- wher-
ever she is -- Susan Quince the
people who work for you everybody
whos ever known you

PARRISH
Yeah And what about my enemies

ALLISON
They respect you Isnt that a kind
of love

Unexpectedly Allison brushes a lock away from Parrishs
forehead with a flick she has rearranged his hair he
blinks a little embarrassed but having liked it

ALLISON (contd)
Above all youve been a wonderful

father

PARRISH
I havent been the father to you
that --

ALLISON

That youve been to Susan

PARRISH
I wasnt going to say --

ALLISON
But thats what you were thinking
And thats okay Because I know you
love me Not like it is with Susan
the way your eyes light up when she
comes in the room and the way she
always gets a laugh out of you as
opposed to me when I walk in a room
and that look comes over your face
What does she want now

A weather-beaten military parade ground pennant passes 24th
Infantry Regiment C (Charlie) Company

ALLISON (contd)
I already feel Ive had everything I
could have wanted for my birthday --

PARRISH
Hey theres lots to come
(gesturing to me
activity)
A little excess -- like you love

The preparations are building to a climax all the elaborate
plans coming to fruition

PARRISH
You know darling this is going to
be a wonderful party

ALLISON
(gently)
Yes it is

Allison wades into the maelstrom now Parrish watches her
go swarms of purveyors and caterers following her

EXT WINE BAR LAWNS COUNTRY ESTATE - AFTERNOON

Ambrose the head caterer is making a last minute check
of the bars stock Quince ambles up in the background the
activity has built to a pitch waiters adjusting their uni-
forms purveyors trucks pulling out in a cloud of dust

Joe appears looking bewildered jostled by caterers setting
up last-minute tables a drummer from the band rolls his
traps past on a little cart Joe doesnt seem to know where
he is when his eyes alight on Quince he heads for this
oasis Ambrose sets down two bottles of wine and departs

QUINCE (contd)

-- they dont matter

JOE
The deepest darkest secrets --

QUINCE
Yeah its like you know every inch
of each others souls -- and then

JOE
What do you mean free

QUINCE

pletely Totally No fear

Quince seems uncharacteristically within himself

QUINCE (contd)
All that hoopla up there reminds me
how I will never measure up to a man
like Bill Parrish - or his daughter

He drains his wine

QUINCE (contd)
Do you like me Joe

JOE
Oh yes you are one of my favorites

QUINCE

What would you say if you knew
it was me who brought down Bill
Parrish

(a moment)
I told Drew and the Board that Bill
depended on you Drew led me on
but I had no business telling him
in the first place He was setting
up Bill from day one Drew and
Bontecou are going to chop up the
company and sell it off for parts
Bontecou was outside Drew was Mr
Inside And I was the fool who made
it all happen Oh God what do I do

Joe regards Quince

JOE
Go to Bill Parrish and tell him
everything Hell forgive you
Quince drains one more glass of wine

QUINCE
You think so How do you know

JOE
Because thats the kind of man Bill
Parrish is

A moment

QUINCE
Well maybe I guess you know him
better than anybody

Another moment

JOE
-- Getting to

The orchestra behind them plays a few riffs sound checks
getting close

QUINCE
Do you think I should wait to tell
him till after the party

JOE
No

Quince nods anxiously then smiles gratefully They look on
as the pre-party activities swirl on around them

EXT FRONT ENTRANCE COUNTRY ESTATE - SUNSET (LATER)

ceiving line that files up the stairs she skirts the house
and heads straight for the action the party on the lawns in
the rear climbs a terrace where she commands a view of the
event on which the curtain is just about to rise

EXT LAWN COUNTRY ESTATE - SUNSET

Guests milling emerging from the crowd Susan sees isolated
by a fountain Joe He looks up towards her he knows she

tter float on the wind He Susie What a party You

Joe is on the right coordinate to meet her his graceful
unfailing step carrying him speedily to a destination he is
not certain of but where he knows he will find Susan

EXT GARDEN COUNTRY ESTATE - SUNSET

She takes Susans arm and marches her off Joe in thrall
watches them go as the MUSIC erupts behind them as up
dance tune a lilting catchy melody envelops them all The
curtain has risen on William Parrishs 65th birthday party

INT PARRISHS STUDY COUNTRY ESTATE - NIGHT

Quince is on the carpet sweating through a confession
Parrish moroses but philosophical at his desk

QUINCE
what can I say after I say that
Im sorry I zipped when I shouldve
zagged I opened my big mouth one
too many times everything got all
twisted --

PARRISH
Its okay Quince I understand
Youve always meant well and I
appreciate that Sometimes things
just turn out -- wrong

A KNOCK on the door it opens Joe appears
JOE
Excuse me --

He starts to step out

QUINCE
Come in Joe -- I want to thank you
-- okay Bill

PARRISH
Sure

As Joe enters Quince flashes a warm smile at him

QUINCE
(to Parrish)
Joe knew the whole story I told
him It was his idea that I come
clean I mean I wanted to come
clean but he gave me a pair of
balls you know what I mean

PARRISH
Yes I believe I do

Quince now drifts off

QUICHE
Yeah well -- I can tell you guys
got business --

PARRISH

No Im out of business right
Quince However I do have some
unfinished business -- with Drew
Get him out here Get him on the
chopper and get him out here to-
night I want to tell this guy
how I feel about him face-to-face

QUINCE
Oh that could be a tall order BP
I doubt that Drews anxious to see
you face-to-face

Joe steps in

JOE
(to Quince)
Tell Drew that Bill acknowledges
that this was a contest and hes
lost The race is to the swift

but could Drew summon a modicum

of understanding and allow Bill to
save face Tell him Bill wants it
understood in the business community
he has merely moved upstairs in his
own company and the executive
continuity is unbroken Tonights
the night to do it Hell introduce
Drew to his press friends as well as
some of his close acquaintances from
Washington and Drew can tell them
that everythings sailing along just
fine

Parrish is impressed by Joes acumen a look of grudging
admiration He nods to Joe summarizes

PARRISH
(to Quince)
All in all what Bill wants to do is
build the golden bridge to Drew with
no hard feelings

QUINCE
You think Drew will go for it

PARRISH
Quince Ive got confidence in you

QUINCE
Sir Ill deliver the package

He heads out Parrish and Joe fall silent

PARRISH
Thanks

JOE
Not at all

A moment

JOE (contd)
How are you doing

PARRISH
What the hell do you care

JOE
I was just asking Bill
PARRISH
You want to know Ill tell you
Youre looking at a man who tonight
is not about to walk through the
Valley of the Shadow of Death hes
galloping into it And the same time
the business he built with his own
hands and his own head is being
commandeered by a couple of cheap
pirates And oh yes I almost
forgot my daughters fallen in
love with Death

Another moment

JOE
-- And Im in love with your
daughter

PARRISH

Say again

JOE
Im in love with your daughter and
Im taking her with me tonight

Parrish is stunned

PARRISH
Youre what

JOE
I think you heard me Bill

PARRISH
Youre not taking Susan anywhere
And what the hell does that mean
anyway

Joe doesnt answer for a moment

PARRISH (contd)
I thought we had a deal

JOE
Im sorry Bill --

PARRISH
Susan is my daughter she has a
wonderful life ahead of her and
youre going to deprive her of
it and youre telling me youre
sorry Well Im sorry apology
not accepted

JOE
I love her Bill She is all that
I ever wanted and Ive never wanted
for anything because Ive never
wanted anything before if you can
understand

PARRISH
How perfect for you -- to take
whatever you want because it
pleases you Its not love --

JOE
Then what is it

PARRISH
Some aimless infatuation in which
for the moment you feel like in-
dulging Its missing everything
that matters

JOE
Which is what

PARRISH
Trust responsibility taking the
weight for your choices and feel-
ings and spending the rest of your
life living up to them And above
all not hurting the object of your
love

JOE
So thats what love is

PARRISH
Multiply it by infinity and take it
to the death of forever and you will
still have barely a glimpse of what
I am talking about

JOE
Those were my words Bill

PARRISH
Well theyre mine now

Joe is silent for a moment cogitating
JOE
Susan wants to come She says shes
in love with me

PARRISH
With you Who is you Did you
tell her who you are

JOE
No

PARRISH
Does she know where shes going

Joe doesnt answer

PARRISH (contd)
Susan went in whatever way she did
for that poor sonofabitch whose body
you took and everything else since
has been aftermath You say you love
her but you dont know what love is
She loves you but she doesnt know
who you are You make a deal youre
breaking it -- the bottom line is
Joe youre conducting a Great
Romance under false pretenses

JOE
I dont like what youre saying

PARRISH
I dont expect you to

JOE
Are you threatening me

PARRISH
I certainly hope so -- I loved Susan
from the moment she was born and I
love her now and every minute in
between and what I dream of is a
man who will discover her and she
will discover a man who will love
her who is worthy of her who is of
this world of this time and has the
grace and compassion and fortitude
to walk beside her as she makes her
way through this beautiful thing
called life

Parrish is beginning to reach Joe
JOE
Are you telling me I cant be
part of it

A pause Parrishs posture changes

PARRISH
Why did you come in here and tell
me Joe You are the Biggest Shot
of all you dont have to ask my
permission but thats what youre
doing You know why Because youve
somewhere somehow developed into a
good guy and you know this is all
wrong I dont know what youre
going to do -- how can this be love
She doesnt know who you are Why
dont you tell her Try it out on
her See what happens Reveal
everything there is to know about
yourself and let the chips fall
where they may

Joe has received what Parrish has said

PARRISH (contd)

Okay -- Ive given it my best shot
I wish I could tell you to sleep on
it but

Parrish lets his words drift into silence he shrugs Joe
regards him

EXT LAWNS COUNTRY ESTATE - NIGHT

Joe makes his way down the path from Parrishs study a
weight on his shoulders his step measured within himself
until he is hit by the lights and laughter and MUSIC of the
party He drifts into the center and runs right into Susan
couples swirl about them the eye of a storm of gaiety

SUSAN
Hello Joe Whatd you know

She smiles

SUSAN (contd)
Theres something so indescribably
sexy about you in a crowd I could
make love to you right here
He hesitates reaches out to take her hand studies

SUSAN (contd)
If youre going to tell my future
youre on the wrong side

A moment

JOE
There is something I do want to tell
you --

He stammers into silence

SUSAN
But you cant

Joe is about to respond but doesnt

SUSAN (contd)
Just then -- when you hesitated --
the way you shift from foot-to-foot
Ive always found endearing but just
now -- I got a chill

But he drifts again now she takes his hand

SUSAN (contd)
Remember that morning in the coffee
shop You said Whats wrong with
taking care of a woman she takes
care of you --

JOE

finding a woman like that

Joe shifts she smiles at his embarrasement

SUSAN (contd)

Joe seems resigned now the air gone out of him

SUSAN (contd)

INT PARRISHS STUDY COUNTRY ESTATE - NIGHT
Parrish is seated by the window lights from the party

flashing past the MUSIC and laughter audible but muted
the fever of the celebration lost on him within himself

Joe enters Parrish looks up

JOE
We should think about getting
started Bill
Parrish waits

JOE (contd)
Itll just be us

The tension in Parrishs body releases he takes a breath

PARRISH
Thank you

Joe nods an acknowledgement but his face reflects his pain

Parrish regards him sympathetically

The silence is broken by a KNOCK on the door Parrish
of politeness to Joe does not respond

QUINCE (0S)
Bill --

After a moment

PARRISH
Come in

Quince appears flushed with excitement

QUINCE
-- I got him The choppers two
minutes away

Parrish weighs the information for a moment

PARRISH

(to Joe)
How are we on time

Joe shrugs nods gently

JOE
Okay

PARRISH
(to Quince)
Get him in here

Quince exits Parrish presses the button for the speaker-

phone

PARRISH (contd)
May -- I know youre busy but I

Sloane for me --

MAY (0S)
At home sir --

PARRISH
No hes at the office

EXT LAWNS COUNTRY ESTATE - NIGHT

An area on the fringe of the party the helicopter blades
stop spinning Quince hurries to the aircraft door opens
it and Drew steps out Quince leads the way through the
lights and MUSIC Drew fashioning an imperial entrance for
himself hails partygoers as he passes Quince enjoying the
irony

DREW
This is damn big of Bill I also
think its smart

QUINCE
He had no choice Youre a
formidable adversary

DREW
He said that

QUINCE
Well youve got him by the short-
hairs

DREW

Yeah the short gray hairs

He flashes a pleased-as-punch greeting to some unseen
acquaintance as they press on to Parrishs study

INT PARRISHS STUDY COUNTRY ESTATE - NIGHT

Parrish is at his desk Joe in a distant corner of the room

SLOANE (0S)
(speakerphone)
Were all here Bill --

PARRISH
I appreciate this Eddie members
of the Board this will just take a
minute of your time As the custo-
dians of the company you may re-
ceive information from what follows

SLOANE (0S)
(speakerphone)
Were all ears

Drew enters with Quince Quince nods excusing himself and
closes the door behind him

DREW
Hi Bill happy birthday --

A moment

DREW (contd)
I just wanted to say how appre-
ciative I am of this - uh - grand
gesture and --

PARRISH
Shut up and sit down

Drew takes a seat

PARRISH (contd)
Youre a worthless sack of shit you
fucked me over played footsie with
John Bontecou sold my company out
to line your own pockets

DREW
I dont know where you get that idea
-- the Board agreed --

PARRISH
The Board didnt know youre a mole
who burrowed inside so you could bury
us all

DREW
Is this Mr Blacks fantasy Another
one of his whoppers Arent you
sick of this asshole lurking around
No one knows who he is but one
thing everyone does know he somehow
got your ear and has been pouring
poison into it ever since

Joe can no longer control himself
JOE

Youre the poison Drew Youve
operated behind-the-scenes to suborn
the trust of a man who has stamped
you with his imprimatur of class and
elegance and stature Ive seen all
kinds and degrees of deception in my
time but Bill Parrish has been on
the receiving end of machinations so
Machiavellian that it has rarely

been my experience to encounter And

yet he has combatted them stoically
and selflessly without revealing my
identity Had he violated the vow
of secrecy he took his task would
have been far easier he could have
turned defeat into victory but he
is too honorable a man to have done
that And now I must release him
from that vow Because of me he
has lost his work his company his
reputation -- and now hes going to
tell you who I am

Parrish is struck dumb
his head imperceptibly
then commandingly

He looks at Joe pleadingly shaking
but Joe nods to him blithely -- and

DREW
(to Parrish)
So tell me tell me Im peeing in
my pants

JOE
-- And now youre going to pee some
more

PARRISH
Joe dont do this --

JOE
Its time to put this person where
he belongs

PARRISH
Its not necessary Joe Drews
going to step aside --

DREW
Im not stepping anywhere --

JOE
I appreciate your gentlemanliness
Bill but what we need to do here is
drive the dagger home --

DREW
The dagger --

PARRISH
told you to shut up

JOE
(to Drew)
Prepare yourself Drew - I am --

PARRISH
He is --
JOE
Ill take it from here --
(to Drew)
I am --
PARRISH

-- An IRS man
Drew is stunned Joe glances at Parrish hesitates

PARRISH (contd)
Yes he is Hes an -- IRS man
Arent you Joe

Joe is at a loss Parrishs eyes are glued to his Joe
the hint

JOE
Yes I am
(to Drew)
IRS man

Drews head swivels from Joe to Parrish and back again

PARRISH
The Treasury Department asked
my cooperation in his undercover
investigation of John Bontecou
They were convinced that Bontecou
on past deals had structured his
mergers and acquisitions in sus-
picious and complicated ways so as
to evade paying the taxes he is
liable for The IRS wanted to go
after him and this deal offered

gets
them the opportunity
(a moment)
I agreed to cooperate

JOE
(to Parrish)
And were very grateful

PARRISH
Moreover Agent Joe Black here --
of course thats not his real name
-- smelled out your involvement
Drew He developed evidence you
were working both sides of the
fence Unfortunately thats known
as a conflict of interest --

JOE
Undisclosed conflict of interest --

PARRISH
An offense --

JOE
An indictable offense

Silence
DREW
I think Id like to talk to my
lawyer --
PARRISH

No lawyers Drew Were going to
offer you a deal

Drew is all attention

PARRISH (contd)
Confess to the Board every details of
your participation and then submit
your resignation

DREW
And what do I get

PARRISH
You get not to go to jail

DREW
Youre talking through your hat
Youre offering a deal because
youve got no proof

PARRISH
Proof Weve got plenty of proof

JOE
(to Drew)
And hes talking through his lips

Joe steps forward

JOE (contd)

Make no mistake Drew if you choose
to test my resolve in this matter
youll be looking at an outcome that
will have a finality that is beyond
your comprehension and youll not
be counting the days or the months
or the years but millenniums in the
house with no doors

Drew slumps

DREW
All right you win As soon as I
get back to the city Ill meet with
the Board

Sloanes voice erupts over the SPEAKERPHONE

SLOANE (0S)
Youre meeting with the Board right
now Drew Resignation accepted
Moreover I propose a motion to re-
confirm William Parrish as Chairman
of the Board of Parrish Communica-
tions as well as a rejection of the
merger with Bontecou International

A chorus of thunderous Yeses resounds through the
SPEAKERPHONE

SLOANE (0S contd)

PARRISH

straight

The door flies open an anxious Allison appears

ALLISON
Daddy Weve been looking all over
for you - this is your party - what
are you doing in here Never mind
Youre on Lets go

She pulls him out of his chair hustles him out of the room
Joe right behind them

EXT LAWNS COUNTRY ESTATE - NIGHT

The guests have formed themselves into a huge audience the
orchestra strikes up Happy Birthday as Parrish appears
with Allison An enormous cake is unveiled with one great
lit candle Parrish beams then laughs He pauses over the
cake now blows the candle out APPLAUSE cries of Speech
Speech Parrish tries to demur but the request becomes
loud and rhythmic he holds up his hand nods quiets the
crowd Joe observes from the fringe

PARRISH
(to the guests)
I thought I was going to sneak away
tonight

YELLS of No Never
PARRISH (contd)

What a glorious night every
face I see is a memory It may not
be a perfectly perfect memory --
sometimes we had our ups and downs
-- but were all together and
youre mine for a night

(a moment)
-- And Im going to break precedent
and tell you my one-candle wish --
that you would have a life as lucky
as mine where you can wake up one
morning and say I dont want
anything more

(another moment)
Sixty-five years - dont they go by
in a blink

Parrish hesitates waves and steps away APPLAUSE that grows
into CHEERS the music resumes another dance tune Quince
grabs him pumps his hand and claps him on the back Now
Parrish spots Allison he wraps her in a tight embrace they
hold each other close for a moment but then are separated

by a surge of guests Parrish sees Susan she smiles but
there is a tinge of sadness about her He heads towards her
they are somehow situated as if they were alone in this crowd

SUSAN
What a night

PARRISH
Im having a helluva time

A moment

SUSAN
You were right about Joe he is
going somewhere --

PARRISH
(gently)
Im sorry

Susan is examining Parrish very closely

SUSAN
Are you relieved

PARRISH
Yes but --

Parrish hesitates
SUSAN
But what

PARRISH
I want you to know how much I love
you That youve given a meaning
to my life that I had no right to
expect and that no one can ever
take from me

SUSAN
Daddy --
PARRISH
No -- I love you so much and I want

you to promise me something I
dont want you to ever worry about
me If anything should happen Im
going to be fine and everythings
going to be all right

(a moment)
-- And I have no regrets

Susan is in pain now she cant summon an answer
PARRISH (contd)
And I want you to feel that way

too

SUSAN
I love you Daddy --

PARRISH
Thats why its okay

They drift into silence

PARRISH (contd)
No regrets

After a moment

SUSAN
No regrets

A long silence Susan smiles

PARRISH
Its a good feeling isnt it

Silence again
SUSAN
Everybodys saying goodbye

They regard each other a long pause they have reached an

understanding

PARRISH
Im still here
(a moment)
Would you like to dance with me
Susan

SUSAN
Oh yes --

He starts to lead her to the floor immediately stops
PARRISH
If you dont mind dancing with an
old fogey like me
SUSAN

Oh Dad youre not old Youll
never be old

He takes her in his arms and they dance away

ANOTHER ANGLE

On a distant fringe of the party a grass terrace that still
commands a view of the dance floor is Joe His eyes are on
Parrish and Susan he watches them admiringly yet ruefully

A Waiter passes catches sight of Joe stops

WAITER
Can I get you anything sir

Joe regards the Waiter for a moment

JOE
Do you have any peanut butter

The Waiter hesitates

WAITER
I dont think so sir

JOE
Thank you anyway

The Waiter moves off Joes attention returns to Parrish

and
Susan the dance number ends a BOOM
ANOTHER ANGLE
On the dance floor

PARRISH
What was that

SUSAN
The fireworks are about to start

Parrish looks up sees Joe up on the terrace waiting

SUSAN (contd)
(to Parrish)
Shall we

PARRISH
You go ahead honey Im going to
catch my breath

Suddenly he hugs her holds her very close She looks at
him he smiles nods but doesnt release her until she
smiles back Now she heads out with the crowd for the
fireworks When Parrish senses she is on her way he turns
and heads up towards Joe

Joe rises to meet Parrish as he approaches

JOE
Happy Birthday Bill

PARRISH
Thank you

They watch the guests gathering to view the fireworks
Joes gaze lingers

PARRISH (contd)
Did you say goodbye

JOE
Not exactly

PARRISH
I guess you have your reasons

JOE
Yes

Silence
PARRISH
Now that we have a moment would you
mind if I expressed my gratitude for
what you did for Susan

Joe waits

PARRISH (contd)
I never heard her speak of any man
as she spoke of you -- It was always
what I wanted for her -- but what
happens to her now

JOE
I wouldnt worry about it Bill
These things have a way of working
out

Joe regards Parrish waits until he has a sense that Parrish
has accepted what Joe has said then Joe continues

JOE (contd)
And would you mind if I expressed my
gratitude

Parrish waits
JOE (contd)

For you For the time youve given
me For the person you are

A moment

PARRISH
Dont blow smoke up my ass youll
ruin my autopsy

Joe barely manages a smile now looks back longingly at the
crowd below searching

PARRISH (contd)
Its hard to let go isnt it

JOE
Yes

PARRISH
Thats life What can I tell you

A silence an understanding there is another more to say
Joe looks inquiringly at Parrish as if to say Shall we
Parrish nods and Joe turns with him They set off now away
from the party up a meadow that leads to a hill overlooking
the river

ANOTHER ANGLE

Down below the party guests faces are lit by the initial
fireworks display Among them is Susan but her interest
isnt there Not something pulls her attention an over-
powering feeling that compels her to turn and see at a
distance Parrish and Joe walking away up the meadow Some-
thing about the sight saddens and at the same time frightens
her she turns back to the party dazed tracing on the
fireworks

ANOTHER ANGLE

Up the hill Parrishs step slows Joe slowing with him

PARRISH
Im getting a little dizzy I can
feel my heart pumping --

But Parrish doesnt wait for a response just continues on
up the meadow towards the rise of the hill Joe in step
with him

PARRISH (contd)
Should I be afraid

Joe stops Parrish stops with him

JOE
Not a man like you

Parrish smiles faintly takes a deep breath he strides
out again Joe right with him In tandem they continue
on and disappear over the crest of the hill A barrage
of fireworks lights up the sky

ANOTHER ANGLE

Down below Susan in a pained reflex again turns and looks
up towards the hill There is nobody there She hesitates
now glides away from the party her step quickens as she
walks up towards the hill

Susan halts in the distance a figure is approaching from
over the crest of the hill where Joe and Parrish disappeared
He is heading straight for her she tries to make him out
seems to recognize him starts to walk towards him as if
pulled by a magnet Now she stops again It is a man he
keeps coming and now that he is close and recognizes him

SUSAN
Joe

He smiles quizzically hasnt quite heard her stands right
in front of her loose smiling disoriented and yet so
appealing They are riveted on each other uneasy and yet
close

SUSAN (contd)
Youre here

He is trying to get his bearings

JOE
-- You bet

Something about him makes Susan slightly tentative

SUSAN
Where did you go

Joe shrugs scratches his head endearingly uncertain of
time and place

JOE
I dont know -- yknow I dont know
-- its all blurred up and hazy And
would yknow what I mean if I said I
dont think its worth figuring out

Some realization is dawning on Susan it renders her
lightheaded

JOE (contd)
But now Im back

Susan regards Joe intently searching his face for an
answer

SUSAN
(gently)
Thats it

JOE
Well I dont know what else to say
Its a helluva party --

SUSAN
You think so
JOE
Yeahand youre the prettier
thing here

Susan blinks a long silence she touches the sleeve of his
jacket now her hand traces the outline of his face she
regards him intently and the dilemma she has been struggling
with the last moments fades away

Susan slowly realizes this is the Young Man She is shaken
a sudden intake of breath

YOUNG MAN
Hey you all right

His hand politely touches her elbow courteously lending her
support

SUSAN
The coffee shop --

The Young Man nods pleased with her recognition

YOUNG MAN
I asked you if I said something
wrong and you said it was so right
it scared you

Susan holds herself very still

YOUNG MAN (contd)
And forgive me for saying this --
but then you said -- and its been
with me ever since --

SUSAN
What has --

He hesitates

YOUNG MAN
You said you liked me

SUSAN
No --
YOUNG MAN
Ydidnt
A moment

SUSAN
I said I liked you so much

She falls silent now overcome by the last moments
revelations The Young Man senses her discomfort which
is on the edge of pain

YOUNG MAN
Hey everythings going great --
dont ythink

She doesnt answer for a moment

YOUNG MAN (contd)
Dont you feel that way

SUSAN
We know so little about each
other

YOUNG MAN

But weve got time

She searches the Young Mans eyes his face is open
completely vulnerable waiting for her response A long
silence the words come out haltingly

SUSAN
I wish you couldve known my
father
Another moment
YOUNG MAN

Me too

Susan signs the Young Man smiles gently they are
completely intent on each other

SUSAN
What do we do now

A long silence

YOUNG MAN
It will come to us

Susan smiles the fireworks finale goes off the MUSIC comes
up from below the night fills with light The Young Man
searches Susans face now takes her hand -- and together
they start back towards the party

THE END
