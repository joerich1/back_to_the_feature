INT ST ALOYSIUS HOSPITAL ICU STAHL’S ROOM - AFTERNOON

The steady breaths of a ventilator Deep rhythmic gasps An
alarm sounds sporadic at first An older man is lying with
an IV tubes coming out of his throat and diodes on his
heart His name is Edward Stahl but we will never hear it

Painful cramps rack his body His legs spasm

A nurse is watching This is CHARLIE CULLEN 36 small
sinewy and very pale His hair is flecked with silver his
scrubs are bachelor white Charlie is leached of colour
except for his eyes they glisten

Charlie removes his stethoscope from his neck as he moves
towards Stahl

He turns off the VENT ALARM and VTACH starts He watches the
monitor and the patient noticing the alarming heart rate

Stahl flatlines and Charlie jumps into action dropping the
side rail then the bed

CHARLIE
I NEED HELP IN HERE

He turns off the VTACH ALARM and starts compressions

He continues for a few seconds before hitting the CODE
button

CHARLIE (CONTD)
I NEED HELP

Charlie continues compressions as NURSE 1 rushes into the
room

NURSE 1
What’s going on

CHARLIE
I came in he was seizing just
started coding

The RT (Respiratory Therapist) runs in and begins bagging
NURSE 2 follows

NURSE 2
What’s going on Charlie
CHARLIE
Came in he was seizing he went
into VTACH and then he coded

NURSE 2

Charlie moves to the side as NURSE 2 steps in More People
enter the room including DR COLLINS

DR COLLINS
What’s going on

CHARLIE
Heard the alarm from the hall came
in saw he was seizing silenced
the vent noticed he was in VTACH
then he was asystolic

The CODE CART comes through pushing Charlie further out of
the circle

DR COLLINS
Anything else

CHARLIE
No epi yet he’s had a minute of
compressions

The Doctor has stepped forward leaving Charlie behind

DR COLLINS
Let’s get the epi started pause in
a minute for a rhythm check

Everyone watches the monitor A Nurse doing chest
compressions checks for a pulse

NURSE
No pulse

DR COLLINS
Is that a shockable rhythm

CHARLIE
(behind him)
Yes Shockable

DR COLLINS
Let’s charge to 150 joules get
back on the chest please
This rotation continues Until
DR COLLINS (CONTD)
AlrightI think he’s had enough
Let’s call time of death Someone
please call his wife
Dr Collins grabs the chart at the foot of the patients bed
DR COLLINS (CONTD)
(to other nurse)
What happened It looked like he
was out of the woods this morning

A moment of silence that feels like an eternity It’s never
easy to lose a patient

No one has an answer They file out the room Charlie stays

behind His eyes drift over Stahl’s dead body

from under her patient gown to an EKG machine She watches
the peaks and troughs scroll their way across the screen

readings He looks very grave

clothes She looks around Maybe at her watch Clearly
waiting for something

AMY
I can’t I need health insurance I
don’t get paid leave until I’ve
been there a year

Amy sighs hopeless

Doctor Hind rubs his eyes sighs and nods Amy is not the
only one of his patients caught in a web of health insurance
and bureaucracy

DOCTOR ROBERT HIND
You have kids right

AMY
Uh-huh

DOCTOR ROBERT HIND
Well You’re high risk for a
stroke You should make them aware
of the symptoms The early warning
signs of an episode are
breathlessness pressure in your
chest feeling weak or faint

(beat)

You need to tell them in case
something should happen at home

Charlie is alone with the body Washing her body It is
ritualistic Every inch of her is tenderly cleaned

He gently puts a strap around her head to hold her jaw Then
holds her head in his hands He moves to her ear lobes And
then he pinches them

Harder and harder squeezing with all his might Desperate
for some sort of release

It never comes His hands relax A jagged breath slips out

Very carefully Charlie encloses Anas face her whole body is
now immaculately mummified in cling film He looks down at
his work Pleased

She stares at them loathing hidden behind a polite smile
Braun takes notes Department of Health

DANNY BALDWIN
What medications

LINDA GARRAN
All are listed-

Baldwin doesn’t wait to be invited he leans forward and
drags the files from the middle of the table

LINDA GARRAN (CONTD)
It’s quite a complicated document

He smiles at her

DANNY BALDWIN
Ill take my chances

He starts to read
Linda throws a look at Malcolm Burrel and continues

LINDA GARRAN
If you turn to the third page you
can see the window in which Patient
1 had abnormal laboratory results
and life threatening symptoms-

Baldwins finds the passage and reads

TIM BRAUN
Where’s Mrs Martinez’s body

LINDA GARRAN
Released to the family

TIM BRAUN
They got a lawsuit together

LINDA GARRAN
We don’t believe the family are
aware of the unusual circumstances
around Patient 1’s expiration

TIM BRAUN
Isn’t that something you should
have disclosed to them

Duncan Beattie leans in

DUNCAN BEATTIE
It was an evolving situation
Parkfield rightly sought legal
council to make sure everything was
done correctly

Baldwin looks up from the pages

TIM BRAUN
Okay Mrs Martinez’s body is
where how do we get it

LINDA GARRAN
It’s our understanding the family
have cremated her

Baldwin and Braun stare at them What

DANNY BALDWIN
When did she die

LINDA GARRAN
Seven weeks ago
(beat)
(MORE )

LINDA GARRAN (CONTD)
We were conducting an internal
investigation Hence the lag

Baldwin and Braun’s faces harden
Baldwin starts to read again

Braun leans forward -- There is a few things he doesn’t
understand

Linda Garran looks to Duncan Beattie for help Doesn’t get it
though

TIM BRAUN
Okay of course we will need to
interview all of the staff that
work in the ICU

town without the horse but it has
been invaded by aliens

ALEX

of “How to be Mayor”

Alex mimes opening a book

ALEX (CONTD)

chain Two - You get driven around
in a big car by your very own
chauffeur Three

Alexs eyes widen a little with panic Her mind blanks

ALEX (CONTD)

CHARLIE
Don’t worry Of course you will

ALEX
No And the teacher said that I
should wear a suit and have a
mustache Dress like a man because
I’m the mayor He said a girl mayor
would be weird

CHARLIE
Women can be mayors

ALEX
I told him that but
AMY
The play is about an alien invasion
and the female mayor is the weird
thing

CHARLIE

Alex and Maya laughs Charlie cringes Sorry

Braun places a cup of coffee on Baldwin’s desk

TIM BRAUN
Cream and two sugars

A medical dictionary is on Baldwin’s lap Anas file on his
desk He painstakingly attempts to decipher the file Braun
appears behind him

DANNY BALDWIN
Have they sent over their internal
investigation

TIM BRAUN
Not yet They told me they need
more time to compile all the
relevant files

DANNY BALDWIN
You’d think seven weeks was enough
of a head start

TIM BRAUN
You’d think You want me to go
through the staff

DANNY BALDWIN
Already did One of the nurses had
a criminal trespass charge over in
Pennsylvania-

TIM BRAUN
A nurse

DANNY BALDWIN
Male nurse Charles Cullen C-U-L-L-
E-N

TIM BRAUN
When

Baldwin hesitates

DANNY BALDWIN
A while back Eight years

TIM BRAUN
What district in Pennsylvania
picked up Cullen

DANNY BALDWIN
Palmer

Braun picks up the phone dials A woman’s voice crackles
down the line we can’t hear what she says

TIM BRAUN
Hello Ma’am I’m Detective Braun
with homicide at the County
Prosecutors Office over in New
Jersey I need some background on
a guy you picked up there in ‘95
would you pull the case jacket for
me please Charles Cullen

Braun listens down the line Baldwin looks at him what

TIM BRAUN (CONTD)
She says there’s a post-it note on
the cover but she’s not sure if
it’s meant to be there Dig ocean

Braun looks at him give me a minute

TIM BRAUN (CONTD)
She doesn’t know the word -
digoxin Can you spell it

Braun looks at Baldwin and signals that he wants him to write
it down

TIM BRAUN (CONTD)
What is that a medicine or
something

Baldwin looks at the letters As Braun wraps up the call

TIM BRAUN (CONTD)

You got anything else on him

(listens then to Baldwin)
Picked up for trespassing and
harassment in ‘95 Says he
slashed a co-worker’s tires after
they broke up Charges dropped

(into phone)
Okay thanks so much

Braun hangs up

DANNY BALDWIN
Something’s not right Parkfield
wait almost two months to report
it an internal investigation you
don’t want to share expensive
lawyers

Tim Braun sighs

TIM BRAUN
What possible reason could they
have for covering up a death What
are the motives

DANNY BALDWIN
It’s a business There’s no bigger
motivation than money when it comes
to that shit right

INT PARKFIELD MEMORIAL HOSPITAL CONFERENCE CENTER - DAY

Linda Garran stands by a little podium reading some papers
Prepares for something She looks nervous

A large conference room packed out with the hospital staff

Amy and Charlie stand at the back Coffee and a buffet of
expensive breakfast food has been pillaged Most of the staff
are gorging themselves in their seats Charlie included

LINDA GARRAN
Hello- You can keep eating we
won’t take up too much of your
time We just want to make you
aware of an event the hospital is
looking into We want to assure you
all that the board and I are
dealing with the incident and
everything connected to it But we
thought it best to bring you all
together and make everyone
universally aware that the police
are also involved

This news pulses through the room Everyone quiets their
attention focuses in on Garran Everyone except Charlie who
keeps eating A couple of hands go up to ask questions

NURSE HARDWICK
What is this about

LINDA GARRAN
There has been an issue with a
patient’s death in the ICU

DOCTOR MOORE
Was the death suspicious I mean if
the police are investigating

LINDA GARRAN
I just want to be clear we are
investigating with the assistance
of the local police

AMY
(to Charlie)
Do you know which patient they are
talking about

CHARLIE
No

LINDA GARRAN
But due to the fact outside
investigation is involved our
attorney Mr Beattie is here and
has a few things to say as well

DUNCAN BEATTIE
Thanks Yes I just want to say I
will be discussing with each of you
individually but as a blanket
statement to all I just want to say
that in times like this patient
confidentiality has to be an
absolute priority Your individual
contracts are very precise when it
comes to this Anyone speaking to
the police without a representative
of the hospital present would be in
breach of their contract-

Concern etches across Amy’s face Next to her Charlie looks
empty Like he isn’t even there Amy doesn’t notice

LINDA GARRAN
At the end of the day Mr Beattie
and I are here for you We want to
be present at any interviews
because we have your best interests
at heart

Nods to Amy and hurries away Amy looks after her as she
disappears down the hall

Amy waits for a while then

LINDA GARRAN (0S)
Hi Amy

Amy turns and finds Linda Garran smiling in the doorway

INT PARKFIELD MEMORIAL HOSPITAL BOARDROOM - DAY

Baldwin and Braun on one side of the table Linda Garran
clearly nervous on the other side

They all watch Amy as she drops into a chair

LINDA GARRAN
Nurse Loughren Thank you so much
for coming in This is Officers
Braun and Baldwin

AMY
What’s this about

LINDA GARRAN
It’s just a few informal questions
the officers are speaking to a
number of staff in the ICU

Amy sits

TIM BRAUN
Do you remember Ana Martinez

AMY
Ana yeah She was my patient

TIM BRAUN
Do you recall anything odd about
what happened to her

AMY
Odd
TIM BRAUN
She died
Amy nods
AMY

Yeah It was sad It was sudden

DANNY BALDWIN
Sudden

AMY
Well People die in the ICU But we
didn’t expect it
A knock on the door Linda’s assistant enters
ASSISTANT
I don’t mean to interrupt but can I
see you for a minute

Linda gets up

LINDA GARRAN
Excuse me I will be right back

Linda leaves And out of nowhere Baldwin slides his green
file to Amy

Baldwin and Braun look at each other They both know that
this is prohibited Braun nods Let’s go

DANNY BALDWIN
Do you see any deviations here

Amy opens the chart scans back and forth her eyes fix on
something

AMY
Yeah her glucose

Amy cant believe what she is reading

AMY (CONTD)
Her blood sugar is wrong- and
there’s no C-Peps Huh

Braun looks nervous to the door

DANNY BALDWIN
What does that mean

AMY
The insulin in her system wasn’t
made in the body it was given to
her

She flips through the chart again
DANNY BALDWIN
You can tell from that she was
given insulin
AMY
Well it’s not listed and she
wasn’t diabetic so insulin would be
a double medication error Which is
really rare-
Amy looks up

DANNY BALDWIN
A double medication error is rare

Amy flaps a little

DANNY BALDWIN (CONTD)
Would that have killed her

AMY
Sure

Braun leans forward grabs the chart and closes it And then
Linda Garran is back

Amy gets it And stops talking Linda Garran sits

LINDA GARRAN
I am sorry Where were we

Braun smiles at Amy and changes the subject
TIM BRAUN

What can you tell me about your co-
workers

Amy waits for permission to speak Braun can see it

TIM BRAUN (CONTD)
You don’t mind if she answers a
question about a colleague do you
Ms Garran

Garran’s lips are a thin line

LINDA GARRAN
Of course not

DANNY BALDWIN
We understand that you work with a
Charlie Cullen

AMY
Yeah

DANNY BALDWIN
Could he be involved in this

Amy stares at him incredulously

LINDA GARRAN
I think we are jumping to
conclusions here officer

AMY
Charlie wasn’t even there when Ana
died She died on the day shift
Charlie and I work nights

Amy looks at Linda Angry

LINDA GARRAN
We have absolutely no reasons to
suspect this was anything other
than an accident Thank you Amy

Amy sees she is dismissed she heads to the door
AMY
I know Charlie really well I work
with him every shift He’s a good
nurse He wouldn’t have made a
mistake like that

Baldwin stares at her appraising Garran won’t look at her

LINDA GARRAN
Thank you Amy

Amy leaves

Garran is left alone with Baldwin and Braun The silence is
icy After a long beat Garran stands Before she can leave

DANNY BALDWIN

investigation

LINDA GARRAN

Garran sighs

TIM BRAUN
We don’t need you to review it We
want it as it is

table Empathetic and caring

AMY
I get that sounds scary but it’s
really not

Alex is quiet Amy can feel everything getting away from her
she looks at Charlie help

CHARLIE
All our hearts they have two
ventricles which are just little
spaces like balloons and they
fill with blood and move it around
the body

AMY
And in my heart they have got a bit
too big and they’ve got thinner
But I am going to be okay I have
medicine and I have doctors helping
me So I will be well again soon

CHARLIE
But you and I need to help And if
she falls over or if she starts
speaking funny funnier than
normal or if you can’t get her to
wake up

Amy is watching Alex carefully The horror in her daughter’s
eyes is not lost on her

CHARLIE (CONTD)
You just put Maya in front of the
TV and call 911 and then call me

Alex doesn’t respond
AMY
It’s not going to happen Honey I
am going to be okay

Amy is looping through Kelly’s labs the phone is in the
crook of her neck ringing and ringing at last someone picks
up in the background she can hear a baby crying

AMY
Hey Tom I think you should come
in there’s been a change over
night If you can you should come
by Sooner rather than later

Amy hangs up Across the corridor she can see into Kelly’s
room It’s full of doctors and residents

Charlie moves along the ward watching all the other
patients

CHARLIE
Hugh pushed his call button but I
got him for you so don’t worry

Amy isn’t listening her eyes are stuck on something in the
chart

AMY
Ohh no

CHARLIE
What

AMY

She has insulin in her system

Amy holds up the c-pep report Before Charlie can look at it-
The code alarm wails Amy and Charlie jump to action-

INT PARKFIELD MEMORIAL HOSPITAL ICU KELLY’S ROOM - NIGHT

Amy is alone Sweat has plastered her hair to her forehead
She’s fought a hard fight Kelly lies half-naked on the bed
Dead All the machines are off Silent without the ambient
noise of the vents and the beeps Amy carefully pulls the
vent from Kelly’s throat she tapes her gaping mouth shut
Behind her someone darkens the doorway

Amy turns to see Tom Vanessa in his arms He’s out of
breath He ran here

Everything about him is tinged with defiant disbelief Then
he looks by Amy to see the dead body of his young wife

Amy watches as his world implodes His eyes are filling his
face is wild and in agony

He wants to scream but his daughter is asleep in his arms He
looks at Amy as tears cascade He hands her his daughter Amy
takes the girl

Slowly he moves forward and puts his hand on her cold
lifeless leg Amy watches as the life drains out of him too
He moves towards the head of the bed

Tom screams it’s inhuman primal anguish It doesn’t stop
it rattles along the hallway

Amy shuts the door sealing Tom’s screams in there with them
Tom screams again and again They devolve into ghastly
heaving sobs Vanessa wakes in Amy’s arms and starts to cry
INT PARKFIELD MEMORIAL HOSPITAL ICU CORRIDOR - CONT
Charlie is in the nurses’ station he watches through the
glass as Amy stands cradling the baby and trying to comfort
the sobbing Tom

Tom’s wailing is deafened through the glass

Charlie watches this silent tableaux of grief and anguish

He watches Amy

This has nothing to do with
Charlie

DANNY BALDWIN
How well do you know him

AMY
I know him really well

DANNY BALDWIN
Do you He’s been at nine hospitals
and none of them will talk to us

A long beat Amy takes it all in -- She does not know what
to think

AMY
That’s not possible If something
like this had happened He’d
never get another job The
hospitals would do something

TIM BRAUN
You would think so They’re
stonewalling us You have to help
us

A long beat Amy stares at him a flash of anger A door
opens

INT PARKFIELD MEMORIAL HOSPITAL ICU NURSES STATION -
NIGHT

Amy and Charlie are alone in the ward Amy is at the Nurses
Station watching Charlie as he finishes hanging fresh saline
on a patient’s IV He looks like a good nurse

Amy glances back to the screen to her mountain of paperwork
she is buried in charts As she sorts through them Charlie
finishes up and leaves the patient’s room

A beat later Charlie sits at the computer next to her slides
a fresh cup of coffee over to her A small smile plays on his
face contentment She watches him looking for some sign

CHARLIE

No

They sit in silence both working
CHARLIE

AMY
Me too I need to ask you
something It’s weird actually

LORI LUCAS

The smile fades from Lori’s face She looks worried

LORI LUCAS
Yeah Why

AMY
I work with him right now at
Parkfield

Amy waits for Lori to speak she doesn’t
Amy stares at her friend spit it out

LORI LUCAS
There was a rumor about him That
he was responsible for a death
That he OD’d someone

AMY
What with

A long beat

LORI LUCAS
A nurse found insulin in the dead
guy’s saline bag Told our boss
she heard he’d found it in a few
Pinpricks in the ones in the store

someone had dosed them before they
went out

Amy begins to pale

AMY
How did you know it was him

LORI LUCAS
We didn’t I never really believed
it was Charlie until after he left
We used to have codes every night
Sometimes two or three After he
left we get one a month if
that

Amy is still lost in thought She empties her glass of wine
She looks scared

LORI LUCAS (CONTD)
(Filled with dread)
You get a lot of codes

INT PARKFIELD MEMORIAL HOSPITAL STAIRS - DAY

Amy runs up the stairs taking them two at a time Her
breath sawing in and out her hearts thundering in her ears
faster and faster - DaDum---DaDum--Dadum-—Dadum-DaDum

INT PARKFIELD MEMORIAL HOSPITAL ICU STORAGE ROOM - CONT

Amy’s breath is ragged she’s still in her civilian clothes
she goes straight to the saline bags - big balloons of clear
liquid Amy grabs one and looks at it under the ceiling
light she squints taking in every microscopic detail

She spots something she turns the bag upside down She
squeezes it hard A drop of clear liquid grows on the outside
of the bag Amy stares at it for a long moment She touches
the bead of liquid it glistens on her finger

Amy drops the bag The panic rattles through her She can
hardly catch her breath She pushes through her pain
clambers towards the shelf sweeps all the saline bags onto
the floor

INT PARKFIELD MEMORIAL HOSPITAL ICU CORRIDOR - CONT 81

Amy storms out of the storage room She stares into the
patient rooms saline is hanging everywhere attached to
everyone Amy’s breath hitches She speeds down the corridor
darting in doorways looking for help She’s running out of
rooms

Amy is growing frantic finally she spots Sandra Her voice
is strangled breathless

AMY
You need to change the saline all
the saline

SANDRA
What What’s going on

Amy’s eyes flash over the bank of monitors at the nurses
station Stevensons is erratic Amy flies along the
corridor wincing with every painful breath Her left arm
goes numb Suddenly she stops She lists against the wall

Sandra hurries to help her

SANDRA (CONTD)
Amy are you okay

AMY
Charlie

SANDRA
What about him He’s not here it’s
a day shift

AMY
Charlie

SANDRA
You want me to call Charlie

Then Amy falls

INT PARKFIELD MEMORIAL HOSPITAL ER ROOM - NIGHT

The room is dark A lamp is on somewhere it’s a spotlight on
Amy A soft tone beeps from the machine next to her The
repetitive waves lull her away Her eyes lazily follow the
wires the tubes in her arm She traces them up to a bag of
saline Dripping into her veins

Amy fights to focus She stares at her body blue shaky and
cold the aftermath of the medication

Something in the darkness moves It’s Charlie He strokes her
forehead

CHARLIE
Hi

Amy’s heart rate monitor begins to pick up its pace Charlie
smiles

CHARLIE (CONTD)
Easy You’re okay Its okay

Amy doesn’t know what to do Her heartbeat races She just
stares at Charlie Frozen

CHARLIE (CONTD)
Don’t worry I checked on the
girls Jackie is with them

He smiles

CHARLIE (CONTD)
I can go get them and bring them

here

AMY
No

CHARLIE
Okay

(beat)
You want some water

Charlie pours water into a glass Amy stares at him

He holds it to Amy’s lips She doesn’t drink She turns her
head away

CHARLIE (CONTD)
Don’t ever scare me like that

again
AMY
Leave
CHARLIE
I know You don’t want them to find
out

Amy looks at the alarm button by her bed Charlie nods

AMY
Where’s the nurse

CHARLIE
Don’t worry your last pressure
looked pretty good and your heart
rate has been below 80 for the last
hour I saw the labs your troponin
is high but trending down You’re
lucky it wasn’t worse

AMY
I need to get home

CHARLIE
Don’t worry I got it

The door swings open and the room fills with light and we see
an ER NURSE in the doorway

ER NURSE
Saw her heart rate blip up
(to Amy)

You are awake
Charlie smiles

AMY
Bring me a discharge form

Charlie looks surprised at Amy
ER NURSE
(to Charlie)
I don’t think that is a good idea
She should stay overnight

Amy stares at the Nurse

AMY
Bring me a discharge form I want
to leave AMA

Charlie looks down at Amy she looks scared He thinks he
knows why

Charlie smiles at the ER nurse and nods
CHARLIE
I got this I will drive her home

and make sure she is looked after

The Nurse shakes her head takes a deep breath and sends her
a look -- Are you sure

Amy just looks back at her Nods Finally the Nurse leaves

CHARLIE (CONTD)
Please stop

Charlie gets up

CHARLIE (CONTD)
Give me your arm

Amy stares at him He undoes her blood pressure cuff

IE CHARLIE’S CAR AMYS NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT

Charlie’s eyes are on the road Amy sits in the passenger
seat

Looking ahead her body still There is no music Just the
steady sound of the engine Amy’s whole body is tense
Charlie is relaxed and small talking

He smiles at her

Amy’s eyes go to him she can barely control the fear on her
face But she has to play her part just right

She looks up They are almost at her house

CHARLIE
You sure you don’t want me to come
in with you
(beat)
I can sleep on the couch I can
take the girls to school

AMY
I don’t wanna scare the girls And
nothing is gonna happen I just
need some sleep
Charlie looks at her understanding on his face

CHARLIE
Yeah You will be fine

He parks in front of Amy’s house Amy goes for the door
handle

AMY
Thanks Charlie

It doesn’t open She’s locked in with him

CHARLIE
But if you need anything-

AMY
Youll be my first call

She forces a smile He smiles back
CHARLIE

Charlie looks at her Then reaches over her opens the door
CHARLIE (CONTD)
Well then go on you’re freezing

AMY
Good night

CHARLIE
Call me
INT POLICE STATION PIT - DAY

Amy sits on the other side of Braun’s desk Baldwin perches
on the radiator behind her

AMY
No one can know I’1l1 get fired

DANNY BALDWIN
Understood

AMY
He does it in the storage room He
does it in the storage room Before
it even goes out He injects the
insulin into the bags and because
it enters the blood stream slowly
it could take hours a day to kill
someone

Amy looks ill

DANNY BALDWIN
So he’s killing people without ever
touching them

TIM BRAUN
Could he use something other than
insulin in those bags

AMY
Any clear liquid could be put in
without any of us being able to
tell

TIM BRAUN
And Digoxin is a clear liquid

AMY
Digoxin Yeah Why

A beat Amy is reeling

TIM BRAUN
Could it kill someone

She nods

TIM BRAUN (CONTD)
Will the nurse you met with speak
to us

AMY
No She’d lose her job

DANNY BALDWIN
Would you mind taking a look at
what we got from Parkfield

Baldwin slides over a folder there’s no more than ten pages
Amy looks at it

AMY
Where’s the rest The full file

TIM BRAUN
That’s all we have

AMY
Well what about the rest of the
PYXIS reports there’s only two
pages here

DANNY BALDWIN
They told us it only stores
information for four weeks at a
time

AMY
No it doesn’t It’s a computer it
stores everything since it was
installed

Baldwin can’t contain his anger

AMY (CONTD)
I can get Charlie’s PYXIS from the
machine in my ward If we have it
and you get the full files we could
prove him withdrawing insulin
before Ana died

TIM BRAUN
Yeah but the problem is Ana
Martinez was cremated So we

don’t have an autopsy what we need
is an actual body

Amy takes a deep breath

EXT TOM ANDERSON’S HOUSE - MORNING

This is a nice part of town Ice dusts everything the
clapboard houses the white picket fences the manicured
gardens Baldwin’s sedan pulls outside

Amy gets out the car heads up the drive way Braun and
Baldwin watch as she knocks on the door After a beat Tom
Anderson opens it with the baby on his arm

The cops can’t hear what Amy says they watch on deaf as Amy
and Tom talk After a beat Tom slouches Amy catches him in a
hug They cling to each other

Amy turns and nods to Baldwin and Braun

EXT GRAVEYARD - DAY
A montage

Tom Anderson stands on the path riddled with agony Baldwin
and Braun stands next to him A bright orange JCB digger
fires up begins to plow into the ground below a grave marked
ANDERSON

Two CSI’s in bunny suits are waiting under the cover of a
tree The JCB hits its mark a hollow thud sweeps over them
It hits Tom like a blow

Tom can’t bear it he turns and walks away

Baldwin follows him The two CSI’s drop into the muddy pit
with shovels It almost swallows them whole Very carefully

they begin to dig

A crane lifts up the vault and places it on the ground

Two men open the vault

Braun looks at Baldwin who is comforting Tom in the
background

Kelly Anderson’s coffin is lifted from the vault and is
hanging from two yellow straps

Baldwin and Braun look at each other

INT PARKFIELD MEMORIAL HOSPITAL ICU NURSES’ STATION -
NIGHT

Amy’s charting Her eyes flit up every few seconds to check
on Charlie She watches him in Joyce’s room She can see his
mouth moving as he talks to the comatose Joyce see him
tenderly touch the woman’s arm as he hangs a fresh saline
bag

She throws her eyes over the bank of monitors All is quiet
all is well Her eyes flick back up to look for Charlie He’s
gone

INT PARKFIELD MEMORIAL HOSPITAL ICU JOYCE’S ROOM - CONT
Amy’s eyes sweep the corridor from the nurses station she
stands and crosses into Joyce’s room she goes straight to

Joyce’s saline bag she removes it throws it in the trash

She pulls a fresh one from the cart and checks it for holes
Squeezing it with all her strength

Satisfied she hangs it on Joyce’s arm and sticks her head
out the door Sweeping for Charlie She can’t see him

INT PARKFIELD MEMORIAL HOSPITAL ICU NURSES’ STATION -
LATER

Amy stands over the PYXIS The ward is deserted She’s alone
She peers down the corridor She can’t see Charlie She works
fast punches in her code She looks through the machine and
finds Charlie’s name and record

She opens “WITHDRAWALS” Amy’s face furrows in confusion The
withdrawal list is empty Charlie has ZERO withdrawals

Slowly something dawns on Amy

She goes back to Charlie’s record and looks for
“CANCELLATIONS” She clicks it open A list of cancellations
fills the small screen Amy smiles and hits print

A dot-matrix printer whirs to life - Screeching in the silent
ward Amy lets out a jagged breath Looks around for anyone
who could hear

INT POLICE STATION OFFICE - AFTERNOON

Sam Johnson stands quietly at the back of the room watching
The report from Kelly’s autopsy photos lie on the table
Braun can see Amy staring down at them guilt playing on her
face He shuffles the patient files and the PYXIS report to
the top hides the gruesome pictures underneath Amy pushes
them aside and grabs the autopsy findings She won’t look
away

DANNY BALDWIN
As you know we got permission from
Kelly Anderson to dig up the body
for examination From the autopsy
we know a combination of insulin
and digoxin were in Kelly’s system
and led to her death in the early
hours of the 15th

Amy points out the lines on the PYXIS report

AMY
On the 14th at 2047 Charlie took
out insulin and digoxin from the
PYXIS

Braun takes it from her and studies it Amy rummages through
Kelly’s CERNER report-

AMY (CONTD)
Here on her report we can see her
blood sugar drops 2156 That’s
the insulin he withdrew at 2047
taking hold And then her slow
arrhythmia-

Amy points it out on Kelly’s file Baldwin’s head is staring
to hurt

AMY (CONTD)
2215 That’s the digoxin That’s
him holding the two murder weapons

Braun looks at Amy

AMY (CONTD)
357 Kelly is dead It’s all right
here

TIM BRAUN
This PYXIS says cancellation not
withdrawal

AMY
Yeah I know There’s a fault with
the PYXIS If you cancel an order
late enough the drawer opens
anyway but it reads on the report
as a cancelation

DANNY BALDWIN
And Cullen knows about this fault

AMY
I saw him do it
(beat)
The orders are all here insulin
digoxin hundreds of others

DANNY BALDWIN
Not according to this piece of
paper This makes it look like he
never got them

AMY
But he did

Braun lets out a frustrated sigh
TIM BRAUN

But did you see him do it this
time

A beat Amy looks back at the papers seeing so clearly what
they prove

AMY
This is the smoking gun I am
telling you guys

JOHNSON
But it isn’t These are all
cancellations There’s nothing
nefarious here no proof of guilt

AMY
He’s been doing it since he started
at Parkfield Look repeated
cancellations that aren’t followed
up by a correct order Repeated
orders of Vec which we hardly even
use And digoxin This screams
wrong

JOHNSON
Maybe Parkfield just didn’t
understand it

AMY
Linda Garran used to be a nurse
She understood it She knows and
they are doing nothing

INT PARKFIELD MEMORIAL HOSPITAL BOARD ROOM - DAY

Charlie is alone he sits by the table in civilian clothes
He looks worried Garran and Beattie enter two suits versus
Charlie Garran’s lost weight her suit swims around her
They sit opposite Charlie Eerily mirroring the scene from
St Aloysius Hospital in the opening

LINDA GARRAN
Nurse Cullen thanks for coming in
on your day off

CHARLIE
You can call me Charlie

LINDA GARRAN
We’ve come across something
troubling

Charlie’s face shows concern
LINDA GARRAN (CONTD)
What hospital were you employed at
before you took the position here

CHARLIE
St Elizabeths

LINDA GARRAN
And what were the dates of your
employment

CHARLIE
I’m not sure Is there an issue
from St Elizabeth’s Because I I
was targeted by some co-workers
And maybe you know they’re at it
again

DUNCAN BEATTIE
What we are concerned with is the
dates you listed on your
application Do you remember what
they were

CHARLIE
I think it was June ‘01 to August
‘03 Maybe

Garran and Beattie look relieved

DUNCAN BEATTIE
Yes that’s what you wrote

LINDA GARRAN
Those dates are incorrect Mr
Cullen St Elizabeth’s confirmed
to us that you were employed from
May Due to these discrepancies
with your application form we have
no option but to let you go with
immediate effect

Charlie looks at them His face hardens
CHARLIE
Youre firing me for writing the

wrong dates on my application

LINDA GARRAN
It is in the contract

Charlie stares at them hopeless

A long beat Charlie stares at them his face hardens

CHARLIE
You need me to sign something

Garran looks at Beattie relieved Beattie slides a document
towards Charlie

Charlie knows the routine He signs it and pushes it back He
looks different

CHARLIE (CONTD)
Is that all

cae

LINDA GARRAN
That is all

Then he leaves Followed by Beattie

LINDA GARRAN (CONTD)
Thank you Mr Cullen

For a few beats after they are gone we just observe Linda
Garran She is clearly struggling with it all

INT POLICE STATION OFFICE - NIGHT

Baldwin Braun Johnson and Amy sit buried in work Reams of
files are piled all over

Prosecutor Ellis joins them

PROSECUTOR ELLIS
I just got news from Parkfield
they’ve dealt with the Cullen
issue

All of them look at Ellis

JOHNSON
What do you mean

PROSECUTOR ELLIS
He’s been fired

JOHNSON
What

DANNY BALDWIN
So they are just gonna let him go

TIM BRAUN
What did they say

PROSECUTOR ELLIS
That they fired him because they
found some discrepancy in his paper

work

TIM BRAUN
What was his state of mind Was he
stable

AMY

You don’t think this could make him
more dangerous do you

Amy looks ill

PROSECUTOR ELLIS
At least he’s not anywhere near
patients He can’t hurt anyone

Braun struggles to contain his anger

DANNY BALDWIN
Nine Hospitals He’s been at nine
hospitals What don’t you
understand They all find a
technicality or he’s forced to
resign They don’t report anything
They cover their own liability and
let him move on to the next place
to become some other
administration’s problem to kill
again and again

Braun and Baldwin stare at Ellis

DANNY BALDWIN (CONTD)
You allowed this

Ellis looks to Johnson for help
JOHNSON
Don’t look at me you did

sound

INT DINER BOOTH - DAY

A large UNMARKED SURVEILLANCE VAN is parked across the

Amy looks around Tries to look calm Whispers

Amy sees Charlie enter the diner

She wants to stay hidden

AMY (CONTD)

Charlie sinks down across from Amy Amy can feel her heart
beating out of her chest as a WAITRESS walks over

WAITRESS

Charlie squirms out of his jacket underneath we can see he’s
wearing scrubs Amy blinks at them confused

Charlie’s eyes focus coolly on Amy

CHARLIE
I don’t want to talk about
Parkfield

AMY
Why

Their eyes meet

AMY (CONTD)
Is what they are saying true
Because I wouldn’t care if you did
those things

She can’t sell it

It’s like a cold wave of static washes over her Charlie is
gone Across from her sits something empty Something that
doesn’t feel human His left eye seems to drift a little off
He’s looking at her and looking through her

AMY (CONTD)
I could understand
(beat)
You could explain it to me

She reaches for his hand before she can get it he slams his
fist on the table It startles Amy She retracts into the
booth Terrified He seems to shrink like a snake coiling
Amy braces herself

Then all of a sudden he smiles empty but polite Her Charlie
is there again like a flipped switch

CHARLIE
I didn’t tell you I eh got
permission to see my girls 2 days
every second week

AMY

CHARLIE

Charlie lets out a harsh breath

CHARLIE

He stands and walks towards the door Amy’s eyes go wide She
speaks into her wire

She watches as Charlie heads outside crosses the lot Amy’s
eyes shoot to the van the cops are in It’s still

AMY (CONTD)

Hi Charlie

Charlie won’t even look at her Amy turns to Baldwin
AMY (CONTD)
Can you please remove the

handcuffs

Baldwin hesitates

AMY (CONTD)
Please

Baldwin removes them Charlie rubs his wrists
He says nothing
Baldwin’s hulking frame stands by the door

Charlies eyes are on the table before him She slides the
coffee cup towards his hand He doesn’t touch it

AMY (CONTD)
You okay

He looks at her hostile indignant that she would dare to
ask

CHARLIE
Go away Amy

He drops his head low retreating into his own world There’s
a long beat

Amy relaxes into the chair Trying to work out some route to
the man opposite her Charlie shivers the skin on his arms
goosebumps around the self-harm scars Amy sees it

AMY
Are you cold You look like you are
freezing

She stands takes off her cardigan and wraps the soft wool
around Charlie’s shoulders He allows the gesture

AMY (CONTD)
I’m just going to put this over
your shoulders

He looks at her just a glance

AMY (CONTD)
And then all this I forgot who you
were to me What you did for me I
forgot about your goodness

Baldwin watches confused concerned

AMY (CONTD)
Ill never understand But I can
listen

Charlie seems to shrink away but Amy doesn’t let him she
leans into him and takes his hand holding it gently

AMY (CONTD)
I’‘1l never understand it Charlie
Not how you someone so kind and
generous and loyal someone who
saved my life could hurt people
And I’m sorry that I lied to you
and went behind your back Because
I think that makes you feel even
more alone And that breaks my
heart

He stares at Amy it’s the first time anyone has ever really
seen him as he sees himself

CHARLIE
I never meant I only ever wanted
to help you

AMY
I know I know and you saved me
You saved my life More times than

and disgust that’s raging inside her

AMY

heart sinks She can feel him closing down See him
retreating

Charlie squeezes her hand She waits for him to speak
At last It’s barely audible

there holding his hand Charlie looks down again Unable to
keep eye contact with her

Amy’s eyes sting Her face tightens as she tries to control
it Charlie sees it He sees her trying He goes on
