September 1

EXT BOYLESTON STREET BOSTON -- MORNING

The boulevard is empty eerie silence No cars no people
man

walks down the middle of the street long trench dark
shades

Though he does not speak we hear

MAN VO
Theres two kinds of people in this
world when you boil it all down You
got your talkers and you got your
doers

We recognize this man as ROCCO He crosses Copley Square
toward the

looming dome of the Trinity Church

ROCCO VO
Most people are just talkers All they
got is talk But when alls said and
done it is the doers who change the
world And when they do that they
change us Thats why we never forget
themSo which one are you Do you
just talk about it Or do you stand up
and do something about it Because
believe you me all the rest of it is
just coffee house bullshit

FADE TO BLACK

EXT DEEP COUNTRYSIDE -- DAY

SUBTEXT Treland

From behind we see two men perched atop a boulder A flock

of sheep
encircles them Their army sacks and shotguns are nearby
They roll
their own cigarettes with effortless synchronicity and light
up
CONNOR and MURPHY MacMANUS (30s) now have long hair with
heavy
facial growth Rugged Piercing eyes Looking to the
horizon
MURPHY
Looks like a storms comin
CONNOR

MOODY MUSIC The brothers drive the flock across jewel green
hills

Murphy cuts a sheep from a thicket and sets it off
POPPA M VO
Peace they say is the enemy of
memory So it had been for my boys

Connor shares some jerky with a sheep dog as the flock
surges
POPPA M VO (CONTD)
For some time now their past had felt
like a dream to themfaded and worn
Murphy touches the faded Celtic Cross tattoo on his forearm
Connor

sees The music takes us to a secluded pioneer-esque ranch

CLOSE ON POPPA Ms (58yrs) face as he coughs and watches
his sons

approach from his rocking chair on the porch

And then suddenly as if not a day had
passedit was back I could see it
in their eyes

EXT FARM -- MOMENTS LATER

Just inside the trees a pack of wolves stalk the sheep

We intercut between BOSTON and IRELAND as chaos erupts

BOSTON Crew Cut quickly enters the church

IRELAND The wolves savagely attack the screaming sheep
BOSTON Muzzle flash blood splatters on the altar
IRELAND BOOM BOOM Connor and Murphy blast shotguns at the
wolves One is hit the rest retreat The boys perform mercy
killings on the wolf and one sheep
Everything calms as Poppa M rushes up with a mag light and
stops

He coughs roughly Moody choral music begins

POPPA M VO
And they cried out How long OLord
dost thou not judge and revenge our
blood upon them that dwell on the
earth

EXT FIELD -- LATER
The boys toss the wolf carcass onto a bonfire It rains
again

POPPA M VO
And God said All will fear the wrath
of the lamb For the great day of
their reckoning hath come

the roiling of the oceans

EXT CHURCH -- MORNING
Breaking news REPORTER 1 is live from outside a church
Squads
coroners vans CSI etc Police hold back crowds

REPORTER 1
There is no new information on the
victim found slain this morning inside
Trinity Church As you can see the
size of the crowd here has increased
substantially over the last couple of
hours People are demanding answers as
to how a priest could be murdered in a
church But perhaps more shocking we
have confirmed that the body was
ritualized with pennies in the eyes
Many remember this as the grisly
calling card of the prolific vigilante
killers known as the Saints who went
on a murder spree here in Boston

courthouse

A rampage that ended six years ago
when the Saints brazenly walked into

off on the wrong foot here Id

memory of a dearly departed mutual
friend A man who taught me everything

After a moment of consideration the cops concede with nods

EUNICE (CONTD)
Lovely

Detectives are curios as Eunice slides on pink latex gloves

She puts in ear plugs and all ambient sound ceases She
starts

slowly down the aisle

TOTAL SILENCE ASEunice inspects the smashed door of a

confessional booth She looks over the body closely then
turns from

the altar and walks to the detectives She pulls her
earplugs and

all sound returns

EUNICE

The detectives nod

DUFFY
The two Vs The victim and venue

EUNICE
Lets go with the venue first Our
perpetrators are devout They would
never commit such an act on sacred
ground And as for the victim

DOLLY
All their vics were criminals Clearly
not the case here So it wasnt them
which means this is a local matter and
it falls under our jurisdiction No
need for Federal involvement so with
all due respectwell see you later
Special Agent Bloom

Eunice stands right in front of Dolly

EUNICE
Man I hate it when people say that

on his knees before Eunice and staring longingly between her
legs

EUNICE
Detective Greenly youre the victim

GREENLY
David You can call me David

EUNICE
Very well David

Duffy and Dolly stand behind Greenly chest to chest each
mimicking
guns to the back of the kneeling cops head

EUNICE (CONTD)
The Saints signature stance Copley
Plaza Hotel four years ago Two men of
identical height put Yuri Petrova on
his knees and each dropped iron to the
back of his head

This is torture for Greenly and he turns his head from
Eunices
crotch She immediately adjusts him back into place

EUNICE (CONTD)
Eyes front David The position of the
victim and the angles produced by the
killers stance created a unique
scenario The bullets criss crossed in
the skull and exited the eye sockets
Here this did not occur The rounds
moved on a straight trajectory through
the back of the victims head and out
the front Which happens when

Eunice circles around positioning herself between Dolly and
Duffy
She aims both hands to the back of Greenlys head

DUFFY
one guys holding two guns to the
back of your head

EUNICE
The Saints were later determined to be
five foot eleven inches tall Its
just dumb luck that the Russian and
McKinney are the exact same height

Eunice kneels putting her pointer fingers just below

Greenlys eyes

EUNICE (CONTD)
The rounds exited Petrovas eye balls
Here they came out the lower cheek
She slides her fingers to Greenlys lower cheeks
putty

EUNICE (CONTD)
Three four inches below the eyes

DOLLY
That puts him at five seven-ish
Thats not uncommonly short

CONCEZIO
Six years ago with the backing of an
adoring public these vigilante fucks

himin public Mi Patrigno a blood
relative and benefactor to all of you
Poppa Joe made you rich and his murder
remains un-revenged

A few roll their eyes at this verbal blunder

Some look

CONCEZIO (CONTD)

This too is infamita These homicidal
maniacs nearly wiped this family out
Its taken a lot of time to build
ourselves up again brick by brick
And now that weve re-acquiesced our
original power can we really afford to
have these guys pop out of the woodwork
someday and try to finish the job when
we least expect it Now for those of

A demolished environment The towering windows are blown

providing a threatening view of the city below Here Eunice
stands looking out over the panorama

EUNICE
(to herself)
On a sultry Saturday in September the
Saints saved seventeen soulstry
saying that five times fast

She turns and walks the marble floor which is like a runway
with pulverized statues A long table of ravaged food

Crime scene personnel toil Ritualized bodies everywhere

is by the panic room He pushes the talk button

GREENLY
Come on Theres nothing to be afraid
of Its all over

He wont come out
He joins Dolly and Duffy who stand on the periphery Eunice
center absorbing the scene when suddenly FBI Agent JOHN

barrels in with his G-MEN 1 - 3

KUNTSLER
Special Agent Bloom You are hereby
relieved of all obligation to this
investigation

He holds up his ID A collective groan from crime scene
personnel

KUNTSLER (CONTD)
Thats right kids This crime scene
is now under the full jurisdiction of
your beloved federal government As of
now you will all report to me Special
Agent John Kuntsler

The detectives look to Kuntslers G-men as if squaring off

KUNTSLER (CONTD)

were

EUNICE
There are three inaccuracies in what
you just said Number one David

GREENLY
If the windows were shattered by
gunfire coming from inside the room
the glass would have been blown
outward As you can see most of it is
on the inside

Kuntsler looks Sure enough His eyes widen

EUNICE
Number two Dolly

DOLLY
Blood splatters in the direction of the
rounds fired If the assailants
discharged toward the windows the
blood would follow suit Here the
majority of splatter is in the opposing
direction

Kuntsler looks Sure enough

DUFFY

three He only fucked up twice
