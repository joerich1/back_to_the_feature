EXT MANHATTAN BROADWAY UPPER 70S DAY 1

From across Broadway we see a little girl waiting at the
curb She steps off the curb toward us --

A TRUCK BARRELS into frame -- The long lens flattened
perspective makes it look like shes just been crushed But
the truck flashes by and shes fine More traffic passes to
and fro through the frame

CREDITS BEGIN OVER

EXT ANOTHER CORNER DAY 2

The LIGHT CHANGES and a crowded corner full of New Yorkers
step off the curb and into the crosswalk -- Before the first
foot lands on the street we go to SUPER SLOW MOTION as the
mid-day work crowd crosses the street

EXT NEW YORK CITY STREETS DAY 3

MONTAGE -- Slow motion shots of New Yorkers mid-day all
kinds going all different ways all over the city

CREDITS END with some high school kids with book bags
walking among the crowds

help

MR AARON
Be that as it may --

LISA
I mean Ill take it over again if you want
but like what would be the point

MR AARON
Well Lisa thats just not necessarily
true Havent you ever developed an

interest in something you didnt initially
think you were going to develop an interest
in

LISA
Um no not really

Mr Aaron looks down for a moment to hide his amusement Lisa
looks at him with secret adoration He looks up

Blue Revised 9705 - Page 3

LISA (CONTD)
Anyway it was open book So whats the big
difference -between using a book and like I

like this person did the whole test for me

MR AARON

8 INT AMERICAN HISTORY CLASS DAY 8
The class is taught by two teachers MR KLEIN 50s and MR
LEWIS 30s On the blackboard are scrawled the words
STRIKERS “PINKERTONS and PREZ McKINLEY

KLEIN

--So the President of the United States
William B McKinley authorized the use of
private detectives to break the strike and
they went out there and shot them down
Just like they did in Virginia just like
they did in Pennsylvania Because they did
not care They did not care

LEWIS
(low rumbling)
And thats basically itThats basically
all there is to say

KLEIN
All right Go ahead uhhhhh Becky
Blue Revised 9705 - Page 5

BECKY
Well Mr KleinI mean was there ever a
good President of the United States

There is some laughter from the students

KLEIN
I dont know Becky I think thats a good
question What do you think You Lionel
What do you think Did we ever have a good
President

LIONEL
UmI dont know I guess most of them
have just been totally corrupt

LEWIS
Lisa

LISA
Can I just say Im not necessarily like a
big fan of all the Presidents of the United
States especially the current one but I
still dont think its necessarily all that
useful to categorize every President as
universally corrupt because that just
seems very general to me Especially if
youre going to judge them by the standard
of -- whatever theyre supposed to
traditionally be like in some mythical
version of America that probably never
existed to begin with

ANTHONY an intellectual smart-ass leans back in his chair

ANTHONY
Lisa has raised a salient point

There are some laughs from the class

- DARREN (CONTD)
What are you doing now

DARREN
Why would you want to buy a cowboy hat

LISA
Because my Dad is supposed to take me and
my brother to this ranch in New Mexico to
go horseback riding and I dont think it
would be right to appear on horseback in
New Mexico without the appropriate
equestrian paraphernalia Darren You
wouldnt understand these things

DARREN

calling out The Bus Driver sees her smiles and waves back

her with good-natured flirtatiousness

ON THE STREET -- The LIGHT at the curb turns YELLOW

THE SLOW-MOVING CAR in front of the bus floors it to make the
light

THE BUS DRIVER sees his way is clear and steps on the gas
He turns and waves goodbye to Lisa She points at her head
and then at him He smiles not quite getting it

The LIGHT turns RED

Still looking at Lisa the BUS DRIVER lifts the hat off his
head in a farewell salute as --

right in front of her and that her blood is spreading
everywhere Monica is reaching out vaguely unable to speak
She is making choking sounds

Lisa stands over her for a second frozen She crouches down
and tries to do something but doesnt know what to do where
to put her hands Other people start converging

IN THE BUS -- The Bus Driver puts the bus in Park opens the
door and rushes out

WE TRACK him as he comes around to where a crowd has already
formed He hangs back on the outside but we break through

JOAN
OK Im sorry I said that LISA

saying --

JOAN
-- If youre really saying youre not aware
that youve been really annoyed with me or
really irritable with me -- and it doesnt
matter if I express it exactly accurately
you know what Im trying to say --

LISA
Not really

JOAN
-- if youre saying youre completely
unaware of that then I have to say I dont
think youre being honest about it Now
maybe Im doing something really horrible
to you without being aware of it but I
have a show opening in two weeks Im very
nervous about it Im seeing a new person
and Im obviously anxious about you and
Curtis liking him -- whether you think I
should be or not -- you were involved ina
horrible traumatic accident youre going
on this crazy horseback riding trip with
your father --

LISA
Oh my God

JOAN
-- which sounds like a recipe for disaster
to me And on top of everything else Lisa
ever since I told you about Ramon youve
been treating me like Im insane

LISA
Um I think youre exaggerating slightly

play I dont frankly give a shit about
Ramon or who youre going out with

I never go out with anyone LISA
Dont talk to me that way Right I dont care

Ive barely had a date in the
last two years

LISA (CONTD)
But I dont care about any of this It
doesnt matter Your boyfriend doesnt
matter Your play doesnt matter except
to you I dont care about New Mexico
because to tell you the truth Im probably
not even going --

JOAN
What do you mean

LISA
-- and you want to know something else
Mom There are more important problems in
the world than our relationship Theres a
whole city out there full of people who are
dying So who cares if I like your fucking
b

Its so trivial Why are you
bothering me about all this It doesnt
matter

Pause The intercom buzzer buzzes Joan hesitates

embarrassed than Ive ever been in my life

basically like the worlds greatest
activity but its not actually worth

getting nervous about
Blue Revised 9705 - Page 54
73 73

LISA
Yeah I dont usually get nervous because I
think its worth it I usually get nervous
because I cant help the way I feel
Although I do think that if anything is
worth getting nervous about its this But
maybe thats just really idealistic of me

PAUL
There is that philosophy

LISA
You are so funny

PAUL
Do you have an ashtray
LISA
Oh you can just chuck it out the window

Paul struggles to open the window and tosses his cigarette
He closes the window and comes across the room to kiss her

out So why dont you just not Youre not
gonna get AIDS because I dont have AIDS -

LISA
How do you know Have you been tested

PAUL
No but Im pretty sure I dont have it
because of my demographic And the odds are
youre probably not gonna have to have an
abortion either And since this was your
first time it might as well be a basically
happy memory instead of a shitty one

my emotions (Pause) AnywayThank you for
deflowering me

I didnt have any kind of relationship with

Monica whatsoever unless you want to count

the fact that she held up my childrens
inheritance for fifteen years I guess

were just supposed to forget about all

that now And I am more than willing But

the person you should be calling is Emily
Morrison who was Monicas friend and is

the person who has been dealing with all of

this in New York But it has nothing to do

with me

Im sorry I didnt really know who to
contact --

over and let anyone who wanted to talk
about Monica just talk about her Maybe
share some remembrances of her Some of us
know each other some of us dont But
were all here because we loved Monica
(She stops Gets a hold of herself) And
because we want to pay tribute to her in a
way that might conceivably not enrage her

Everyone laughs slightly

EMILY (CONTD)
I dont want to tell anyone what to think
or how to feel And I dont want to kid
myself about the stupid meaningless way
she died because it would really make her
throw up But I dont want it to become the
summation of her life Because its not

When her Lisa died I said to her How can
you stand it And she said First of all
I cant But I dont want to take away the
twelve years she did have and turn them
all into leukemia Because they werent
So despite the fact that she got --
eff I do think its important to remember
that Monica got a lot out of life She was
the most fully developed person I
personally have ever known She was also
impossible to get along with but thats
another story

OR FO OE OE

Everybody laughs

EMILY (CONTD)
As most of you know she had more than her
share of trouble over the years But that
never diminished her compassion or stopped
her from embracing life to the absolute
fullest -- measure

Brooklyn Thank you

She writes down the number and hangs up Looks at the number
Dials the phone It rings once She hangs up

INT ENGLISH CLASS DAY 96

Lisa is very disengaged from the discussion John is walking
back and forth reading aloud from King Lear
JOHN
(reading)

We are to the gods as flies to wanton

boys They kill us for their sport

(Pause) We are to the gods as flies to

wanton boys They kill us for their sport

What do you make of that Lisa Lisa

LISA
I dont know

JOHN
Take a stab What do you think Shakespeare
is saying about human suffering here

LISA
I dont know Sorry

JOHN
You know what Lisa Thats not good
enough Thats not good enough
Shakespeare wrote something Whats your
response And dont tell me you dont have
one because I dont buy it

LISA
I dont really have a lot to say It seems
pretty self-evident to me

JOHN
(Pause Then )
Matthew
MATTHEW

I think it is self-evident I think hes

saying that human beings dont mean any

more to the gods than flies do to little

boys who like to torture them for fun”

MATTHEW (CONTD)
Like as far as the gods are concerned were
just ants Nothing (like a newscaster
turning to his colleague) Darren

The class laughs

DARREN
(responding in kind)
Thank you Matthew Yeah I agree Only
its not Shakespeare saying it Its
Gloucester Maybe another character would
have a different point of view

JOHN
OK Thats a valid point Just because
Shakespeare has one of his characters say
it doesnt mean he personally agrees with
it Yes David

DAVID
Yeah maybe Shakespeare isnt saying the
gods dont care about us Maybe hes saying
theres a higher consciousness that we
cant see That the gods perception of
reality is so much more developed than ours
that compared to their perception our
perceptions are like comparing flies to
boys

JOHN
OKI dont think thats what hes getting
atI think what hes getting at here is a
very dark view of the arbitrary nature of
human suffering

DAVID
But maybe hes not Maybe hes comparing
human consciousness to divine
consciousness and hes saying that even
though it seems to us that human suffering
is just arbitrary thats just because
were limited by our viewpoint

JOHN
Well -- lets look at the text Lets test
Davids hypothesis “We are to the gods as
flies to wanton boys They kill us for
their sport I have to agree with Matthew
that seems pretty unambiguous

DAVID
Yeah because hes saying theres a higher
purpose that we cant see Hes saying that
what seems like them killing us for sport
could just be because our consciousness
isnt developed enough to see what the
higher wisdom of their killing us is
2nd Blue Revised 102805 - Page 75
96 96

JOHN
OK but -- I still dont think thats what
hes trying to say Um

DAVID
No like if you say they kill us for their
sport when our perception of the gods is
so meager that we cant even tell what
theyre doing then how can we be so
arrogant as to think that they would bother
to kill us for their sport

JOHN
(lost)
I dont knowUm -- Monica

MONICA
I dont think thats what hes saying at
all I think hes saying the gods dont
give a shit about human beings and they
just kill and torture us for fun --

MATTHEW
Yes Much like flies to wanton boys
Anybody Anybody

MONICA
Yeah

DAVID
But if the gods consciousness is so much
more developed than ours that we seem like
flies to them then how can we be sure what
they have in mind for us or why they do
anything

JOHN
David I think youve made your point
But its not what Shakespeare meant
Scholarly opinion is pretty consistent that
hes trying to say something about
human suffering here --

DAVID
Scholarly opinion

JOHN
And in this particular play what I think
hes trying to say is pretty black --
pretty bleak --

DAVID
But what are you saying A thousand
Frenchmen cant be wrong
2nd Blue Revised 102805 — Page 76
96 96

JOHN
No Im not saying that But I would
like to move on --

DAVID
I think he is saying that because hes
comparing human consciousness to flies and
hes saying that we cant see the truth
around us because our consciousness is
undeveloped

JOHN
No David thats not what Shakespeare
meant He says it somewhere else in the
play but I dont want to get hung up on
this any more because its not what
Shakespeare meant and I would really like
to move on

David laughs derisively

already decided it was No Fault or No
Criminality or whatever they call it --

been a part of it

MITCHELL

And what do you think I should do with you

Just gimme a clue ‘cause Im just a little

bit lost over here
LISA

Do whatever you want I know what I did
MITCHELL

OK Well Before we do anything Lisa
anybody will tell you that just because he

ran a red light is not a criminal offence
LISA
Even if he kills someone
MITCHELL

(Simultaneous)
Even if you cause an accidental death
thats right For this to be a criminal
offense the law says you need two

aggravating circumstances Like he ran a red
light and he was speeding Or he ran a red
light and he was --

LISA
(On 2nd red)
So hes not liable to be prosecuted for
Manslaughter Or second degree murder

MITCHELL
No He could be charged with reckless
driving and fillin out a false police
report Which thats no joke --

LISA
Thats unbelievable What does he have t
do Kill her on purpose

MITCHELL
Yes Because thats the definition of
murder Killin somebody on purpose
Youre not sayin he ran her over on
purpose are you

Pause

LISA
No

Pause

MITCHELL
All right look Lemme take another
statement and uhWell look into it

lawyer are at a window table

EMILY
Lisa Dave is one of my best friends
Hes a terrific lawyer and if he doesnt
know what to do himself hell certainly
know someone we can talk to

LISA
OK great

EMILY
So Dave just tell Lisa everything you told
me if you dont mind repeating
yourself --

DAVE
Not at all I love to repeat myself

LISA
Are you guys gonna order something

INT COLUMBUS AVENUE RESTAURANT DAY LATER

Blue Revised 9705 - Page 108

They are drinking coffee Lisa smokes

Why not
were gonna look into it

again

DAVE
When someone is killed its what you call a
Wrongful Death Suit which is a statutory
case which just means theres a statute
passed by the legislature which gives you
the right to bring the case

LISA
As opposed to what

DAVE
As opposed to common law which is law made
by judges Which is why the damages are
limited

LISA
I dont understand

EMILY
Look just skip that part We dont care
about that

LISA
I thought we were trying to get the
police to arrest this guy

DAVE
No -- the police are not uh --

LISA EMILY
They told me they Dave doesnt think the
police are gonna --

DAVE
Im just telling you that even if they do
there is no way in this world they are
gonna recommend to the DA that they charge
this guy Thats why --

LISA
(On “Thats)
So what can we do

DAVE
Well Im --

LISA
Sorry

DAVE EMILY
Thats OK -- Thats OK honey

DAVE
Im just getting to that You cant
do anything unless youre a relative --

EMILY
She didnt have any relatives except for
those idiots in Arizona --

DAVE
(on except)
-- ar -- hang on a minute - unless youre
executor of her estate --
EMILY
I am the executor of her estate
DAVE
- which is Emily I know
EMILY
So good
DAVE

Yes This is good Because the executor of
the estate can bring a Wrongful Death suit
but the beneficiary has to be a relative
So let me explain about that In a Wrongful
Death suit you can sue for Pain and
Suffering Pecuniary Losses Loss of
Support or ServicesAnd also whats
called Care Comfort and Society --like
advice counseling of the parent that the
kids arent gonna get anymore

LISA

You can really sue for that
DAVE

Yeah and thats probably what we would do
LISA

So -- I dont understand Who are we suing

The bus driver

DAVE
Well no because the bus driver wouldnt
have any money You basically sue everybody
and hope something sticks The person who
pays will be the MTAs insurance company

LISA
But do you think the driver would get
fired
Pink Revised 92505 - Page 109A
128 128

DAVE
No Not necessarily
“Blue Revised 9705 - Page 110

128 128
LISA
Even if all the facts came out at the
trial
DAVE
Maybe I dont know
EMILY
But how much could they be liable for
DAVE EMILY
It depends How badly do you think we
could ever hurt them
DAVE
-- if she was alive in great pain for an

extended period of time they give more
money for that

LISA
Id say she was alive for ten minutes

DAVE
And I gather in a lot of pain

LISA
Her leg was cut off

DAVE
Yes - obviously And -- but was she
conscious Awake the whole time

LISA
Im sorry Emily (To DAVE) Yeah awake
EMILY
Thats OK
DAVE

Well if she was in a lot of pain for that

longI dont knowmaybe 300000 or a

half a million dollars to get a sustainable

verdict A brain damaged baby would be-
three million But the truth is Lisa
after alls said and done its not a very

good case

LISA
Why not

DAVE
Because its your word against his and
because you already lied on your first
deposition A red light case is a fifty-
fifty proposition already And with only
one eyewitness with two conflicting
statements I wouldnt take that case
Pink Revised 92505 - Page 111
128 128

EMILY
Nobody really cares about getting a lot of
money here

DAVE
I understand that —-

EMILY
We just want this prick to suffer and we
want the bus company to take responsibility
for hiring this guy

DAVE
I underatand But no matter how you slice
it the fact that Lisa lied on her first
statement is a disaster for your lawyer

LISA
Cant I explain why I lied the first time
It‘s not like Im trying to get any money
for myself

DAVE
Thats trueSince she have no financial
interest she cant be impeached for bias

EMILY
Impeached for what

DAVE
She cant have her credibility attacked on
financial grounds because the jury knows
youre not getting any money if you win

LISA
So thats something isnt it
EMILY
But do you really think we know what that
means
DAVE
I’m sorry Thats what it’s called
EMILY
But who are you talking to You know we
dont know what that means Its lik
youre not really concentrating
DAVE
I -- dont know I am concentrating Im
just thinking out loud
EMILY
OK All right Im sorry

Anywaythe only thing I could think of is
it igs the MTA So theyre not gonna want a
lot of publicity

LISA
Anyway the whole point is to get this guy --

EMILY
Is to fucking get this guy

LISA
No its to get him out from behind the
wheel of a bus

DAVE
Did she know she was dying I only ask
because the terror of knowing youre dying
Yaises the damages

LISA
I think she had a pretty good idea

DAVE
If she had lived for a couple of days it
would make the case betterI know thia
sounds horrible but this is what it comes
down to

EMILY
I know We know Dave Thats OK

I actually did have one more thoughtI do

Its a big big mess Last year I helped to
found an organization to work with children
whose families have been killed or the
parents have been kidnapped so they dont
know if they are alive or dead We try to
find homes for them preferably in
Colombia because if we lose our young
people thats it Thats the future We
have raised a lot of money but theres
only so much we can do You dont like to
say its hopeless but its hard to see the
solution

134 134

EMILY
You called a what A what
DAVE
Private Investigator -- to see if he could
find anything out about your bus driver --
LISA
Really
DAVE EMILY
Yeah So he -- Dave
DAVE

Wait let ma tell you what he said So he
called this guy he knows who used to be a
cop for the MTA Did you know the MTA have
their own police The MTA police They have
their own uniforms

Ld

EMILY
Yeah Yeah Yeah
DAVE EMILY
And -- Just a minutel Jesus Christ What do we

give a fuck about the MTA
police and their uniforms

DAVE
-- so this guy got someone to let him
sneak a look at your guys file And it
turns out hes had two previous accidents -
less than two years apart -- one of them on
the job one in his own car --

EMILY
What
DAVE
-- where there was some allegation that he
was drinking which was dropped but that

hes never been cited or disciplined just
moved around to different shifts --

EMILY
Are you fucking kidding me

LISA
Why does this not shock me

DAVE
Because Surprise Surprise his brother-in-
law is a very big muckety-muck in the
Transit Workers Union --
Pink Revised 92505 - Page 119

134 134
EMILY
(ie I get it)
O-Kay1
DAVE

And if you read the paper youll know
theyre going through a protracted labor
dispute at the MTA right now and according
to my PI the management doesnt want to
aggravate the situation by firing this guy
Especially since the police have concluded
he was not at fault

LISA
This is making me sick

DAVE
I know but what it means Lisa is that we
have a case

LISA
We do

DAVE
What it meana in fact is that we have a
very good case because we can sue for
whats called Negligent Retention Which
means they should have known the guy was a
bad risk and was irresponsible and they
negligently retained him until he finally
killed somebody

EMILY
And you can prove that

DAVE
Sure because we can subpoena their
Personnel records which we already know
contain damaging information because my
investigator got a look at them beforehand
Which youre not supposed to do but we did
it anyway

LISA
Youre gwesome

EMILY
And that means

DAVE
That means were in great shape and I think
we should go in there and sue their fuckin
asses off

EMILY
But you wouldnt be our lawyer right
Pink Revised 92505 Page

134 134
DAVE
No no Oh no
LISA
Why not
DAVE EMILY

LISA
’ Really My God
DAVE
But you gotta get that crazy cousin on
board because shes gonna be your
beneficiary

five hundred thousand dollars Shes gonna
come to New York

LISA
Whats with Monica and her cousin

executor of the estate because he didnt
want Abigail and her idiot husband to get
their hands on the money before the kids
were grown up

Green Revised 10705 - Page 121
135 135

EMILY (CONTD)
For which Abigail rewarded her by badgering
her about it on the phone for fifteen
years Always trying to borrow money
against the estate accusing her of making
lousy investments with it nasty phone
calls nasty letters every month for
fifteen years until Abigails daughter
turned twenty-one and got married Then
Monica goes to the wedding in fucking
Arizona and Abigail literally wont speak
to her Shes a dream

LISA
So thats who were getting the money for

EMILY
Its not who were getting it for its who
were getting it from

136 INT DEUTSCHS OFFICE DAY 136

Emily and Lisa sit with RUSSEL DEUTSCH 50s His law office
is slightly smaller and less nice than Daves

DEUTSCH
First thing we do is we file a summons and
a complaint against the MTA They get
twenty days to respond and when they do we
can make our Discovery requests Accident
reports personnel records et cetera But
you gotta realize its gonna take some
time The law says you have to get a court
date within a year Usually it takes about
six Depending

LISA
Six years

DEUTSCH
Depending yes

EMILY
Now I mentioned to Dave I have a friend
who writes for the Metro section of the
Times

DEUTSCH
Yes Now this if it could really happen
this changes everything in our favor If
they think theres gonna be adverse
publicity especially in The New York
Times theyre gonna want to settle right
away soon as possible and as quietly as
possible --

EMILY
So theyd make it a condition that

Pause

Blue Revised 9705 - Page 122

DEUTSCH
Its usually done you get the money but
you cant talk about it Nobody knows the
terms

LISA
So what good does that do

DEUTSCH
You get the money (Pause) Is that bad
(Pause) I thought thats what were all
here for (Pause) This is how our society
punishes people for doing bad things

LISA
By getting money from their employers
insurance companies

DEUTSCH
Yes Its called Punitive Damages

LISA
Could we insist they fire the driver As
part of the settlement

DEUTSCH

Yes sure why not
LISA

JOAN
Oh -- all that stuffs a long way off

EMILY
I dont go to the theater very much
JOAN
Well its just nice because you can work

a long time in the theater and play really

good parts without getting a lot of

recognition And even though you dont
necessarily do it for that as your primary

motive it is very nice when people do

notice something youve done

EMILY
Uh huh

JOAN
I was on a television show a few years ago
and I had been doing theater all my life
and suddenly all my relatives started
calling me up to congratulate me because
they thought I finally Made It And it was
really just this dumb show that paid the
bills for a while

LISA
That show was so stupid
JOAN
It wasnt that bad Anyway I realize

this is horribly embarrassing for Lisa but
I really wanted to meet you Emily because
youve frankly become such a big part of
Lisas life and I dont want to be
intrusive but this whole court case seems
to be suddenly dominating everything and I
cant get Lisa to tell me anything about it

LISA
Thats not true

JOAN
Well I cant And I want you to know
Lisa that Im very very proud of you for
pursuing this the way you have

(MORE )

JOAN (CONTD)
But I cant let you pursue it to the point
where its taking over your life or
interfering with your school work (To
EMILY) Its really come down to a question
of homework Lisa is on a half-scholarship
at her school And I know she feels a real
sense of responsibility about what happened

LISA
Yeah I do

JOAN
I know you do I know you do But you cant
not do your homework and you cant throw
away your scholarship because of it

Were just waiting for them to schedule the
Discovery conference

JOAN

LISA
Mom It really doesnt matter

Blue Revised 9705 - Page 126 139

EMILY

comfortable with someone that no one has
ever heard of --

EMILY
My friends heard of him He says hes very
good

ABIGAIL

responsibility in this situation and I
would feel a whole lot more comfortable
with somebody who didnt just drop in out

2nd Green Revised 112005 - Page 128
142 142

EMILY
He didnt drop in out of the clear blue

ABIGAIL
No if you all think hes good

think she thought I was her daughter for a

minute And then she was asking me to call
her like to tell her what happened You
know like she didnt remember she was
dead

EMILY
What do you mean What did she say

LISA
She just asked if somebody could call her
daughter But then it got confusing because
I said Sure whats her name And she
said her name was Lisa And I said No
thats my name Because it took me a
minute -- I didnt realize we had the same
name

Emily does not respond

LISA (CONTD)
But I couldnt tell if what I was saying
was registering with her

Emily does not respond

LISA (CONTD)
But then when I found out her daughter was
dead ever since then I keep having this
really strong feeling that some way for
those last five minutes I kind of was her
daughter You know Like maybe thats the
reason I was there Like in some weird way
this obviously amazing woman got to see her
daughter again for a few minutes right
before she died

be

EMILY
(very dry)
I see And is she still inhabiting your
body Or did she go right back to the
spirit world after it was over

EMILY
Yes

LISA
You think Im making this into a dramatic
situation because I think its dramatic

EMILY
I think youre very young

LISA
What does that have to do with anything
If anything I think it means I care more
than someone whos older Because this kind
of thing has never happened to me before

EMILY
No it means you care more easily Theres
a big difference Except that its not you
its happening to

LISA
Yes it is I know Im not the one who
was run over —-

EMILY
Thats right you werent And youre not
the one who died of leukemia and youre
not the one who just died in an earthquake
in -- Al ia But you will be Do you
understand me You will be And its not
an opera and its not dramatic --

LISA
Im well aware of that

EMILY
And this first-blush phony deepness of
yours is worth nothing

LISA
Oh wow

EMILY
Do you understand Its not worth anything
because itll be troweled over in a month
or two And then when you get older and
you dont have a big reaction every time a
dog gets run over then then well find
out what kind of a person you are But this
is nothing Im sorry but I didnt start
this conversation and I dont play these
games

I am not -
EMILY
And dont look so outraged Because Im not
saying anything very outrageous Im

telling you to knock it off You have every
right to falsify your own life but you
have no right to falsify anyone elses
Its what makes people into Nazis And Im
sorry but its a little suspicious that
youre making such a fuss about this when
you didnt know her and youre having
troubles with your own mother --

LISA
Oh my God

EMILY
But this is my life were talking about
much more than it is yours Because its my
real friend who got killed who Im never
going to see again really Whom I have
known since I was nineteen years old
myself OK And I dont want that sucked
into some kind of adolescent self-
dramatization

LISA
Im not fucking dramatizing anything

EMILY
(not having it)
OK --

LISA
I was there and you werent And if I
happen to express myself a little
hyperbolically Emily thats just the way
I talk I cant help it if my mother is an
actress Why are you being so fucking
strident

EMILY
Strident

LISA
Yeah

EMILY
OK Um you should leave

LISA
Why Because I called you strident
Blue Revised 9705 - Page 132

EMILY
Well I cant stop you doing this so I think
you had better go

LISA
OK I will

EMILY

Lisa grabs her purse and coat Emily half-walks half-drives
her toward the door

LISA (CONTD)
Does this mean were dropping the whole
inquiry

EMILY
It means youre leaving I dont know what
else it means

LISA
All I meant by saying you were strident was
that you were being emphatic I obviously
misused the word

EMILY
Look it up when you get home

LISA
Jesus Christ Youre amazing

EMILY
Yeah Uh huh Im amazing

LISA
(bursts into tears)
Why are you doing this

EMILY
Lisa Im not doing anything Im a human
being Monica was a human being So was
her daughter And so is your mother

2nd Green Revised 112005 - Page 133

EMILY (CONTD)
We are not supporting characters in the
fascinating story of your life

LISA
I never said or thought you were And I
really didnt mean to call you strident I
totally misused the word I wasnt trying
to insult you Emily I really wasnt I
feel so bad about what happened and Im
trying so hard to do something about it
And I dont understand why if I say
something wrong you cant just give me a
break I didnt mean I thought her daughter
took over my body Im not an idiot It was
just this feeling I had because she was
holding onto my hand so hard before she
died and because we had the same first
name

EMILY
OK

LISA
But Im not trying to dramatize anything
Emily I really know about that trend and
I really dont think Ive been doing that

EMILY
OK I believe you And look up strident

INT HISTORY CLASS DAY 145

On the blackboard Klein finishes writing SHOULD TEENAGERS
RULE THE WORLD YES OR NO

KLEIN
OK Go ahead Kirsten Lionel Put your
drum away

Lionel stops drumming on his desk with his fingers

7 KIRSTEN
I think that teenagers should definitely
rule the world because teenagers arent
corrupted by adult life yet and theyre
idealists and they care And I know a lot
of people feel that teenagers are really
naive which they are many of them But
they still havent had a chance to get
burned out by the disappointments and the
harsh realities of learning how to play the
game So yes I would vote yes

KLEIN
All right Lisa

LISA
I would tend to agree with all of that
except I do think that teenagers dont
always necessarily think things through
very carefully and they dont have enough
experience to know what the right thing to
do is all the time I also think they tend
to adhere to ideologies really easily
without having actually bothered to think
them through for themselves --

LEWIS
Such as what

LISA
Such as what Such as gee I dont know
the Hitler Youth

KLEIN
OK Hitler Youth

LISA

Or what about all these teenage suicide

bombers Not that I want to get into the

whole Palestinian thing again but assuming

you dont think suicide bombing is a good

thing wouldnt you say thats an example

of being idealistic without using your

critical faculties

that the suicide bombers -- just for

JOAN
But who is running these discussions

RAMON
Well but Lisa you have to remember its
always easy for the dominant side to be
content with the status quo

JOAN
Mmm

EMILY
How do you mean Ramon

RAMON

I mean the oppressor is always in favor of

law and order because its his law and his

order He uses violence to maintain his
position and calls it the rule of law But
when the person underfoot uses violence to

change his status hes called a criminal

and a terrorist and the violence of the

State is called upon to put him down and
once again its called the rule of law In
Colombia --
EMILY
I see And what would you like them to do
Pause
RAMON
They meaning --
EMILY
The Jew oppressors What would you like
them to do

Nothings the matter Nobody seems to
really want to go and I dont really feel
like spending three thousand bucks on

in So I think its obviously better for
everyone if we just cancel

I never said I didnt want to go

KARL
Well I cant seem to get a straight answer
about what anybody wants to eat um
Annette is giving me a hard time about her
schedule I talk to Curtis and all I get

coming out here next year

I just need to talk to somebody who doesnt
completely misunderstand who I-am Or not
even who I am but whats going on inside
me or all around me Sound confused
enough Anyway for whatever reason I
always felt like we understood each other
on some level even though Im like a mass
of conflicting impulses and youre
basically the most grown-up rational man I
know

MR AARON
WellI doubt thats actually true
but thank you

LISA

your soul I guess and how you feel you

MR AARON

WellWe all have feelings Lisa I happen
to believe that who you are comes out of
how you deal with those feelings Somebody
makes you mad you dont just pick up a gun
and shoot themOr if you do that says
something about who you are and how youve
been raised

LISA
Well I dont want to disillusion you but
we happen to be living in a world where
that is what people do More often than
not

MR AARON
Thats not true Lisa I think its very
sad that you see it that way Theres
eight billion people alive in the world and
you think they dont all want to kill

someone once in a while But they dont
Most of them Or they see some person they
-- (Pause) I think most people do try to be

civilized by some standard Even if its a
standard you and I might not agree with

be a serious wrinkle for you all -- is that
the bus company will absolutely not discuss
the removal of the driver

LISA and EMILY
What

LISA
What do you mean

ROB
The driver

LISA EMILY
Then forget it Tell them to What do you mean they
forget it wont discuss the removal

of the driver

DEUTSCH
Please Ladies Let me ROB
finish what Im saying Whoa -- hello

ABIGAIL
Its just a blast in our ears

EMILY
(to LISA)
Let him finish

LISA
Finish what Forget it

DEUTSCH
(to EMILY)
Thank you I want you to understand Lisa
I pressed them very very hard on this but
they will not discuss disciplining of a
company employee as part of the settlement
because it could be seen as an admission of
guilt on the part of the MTA --

LISA
What does giving us three hundred thousand

dollars mean

DEUTSCH
Settling out of court does not imply an
admission of guilt It simply does not
carry the same stigma On top of that you
may not know Lisa theyre involved in a
very tricky labor dispute at the MTA right
now

LISA
Yeah we know all about that Just tell
them to forget it’

DEUTSCH
I know thats your reaction

LISA
Its the only reason were here

ROB
Can I jump in here Russel

DEUTSCH
(to LISA)
-but its really not your decision

ROB ABIGAIL
Hello Are you still with us Please

LISA
Its Emilys decision

EMILY
No

DEUTSCH
No

ROB
Hello

LISA
Its not

ABIGAIL
Theyre not listening Robbie

DEUTSCH
Its Abigails decision because shes the
next of kin

LISA
But she didnt even know about it

EMILY
That doesnt matter

ABIGAIL
Could we get back in this conversation
please

DEUTSCH
Yes Im sorry Obviously theres some very
strong emotions going either way on this --

ABIGAIL
Listen Emily I dont know what youre
thinking but Rob and I are thinking we
should take Russels recommendation while
we can Because if they wont fire the
guy theyre not gonna fire him And six
months or a year from now were gonna --

ROB
Exactly

ABIGAIL
- were gonna be in a situation where
were beggin them for half this much
which is gonna hurt ‘em half as much as
now and theyre still not gonna fire this
guy Or maybe hell have already quit and
the whole thing will be moot by then Do
you see what I mean

LISA
The entire point of the lawsuit was to get
the guy fired so he doesnt kill somebody
else --

DEUTSCH
Lemme just clarify --

LISA
-- it was not to get you three hundred and
fifty thousand dollars you didnt know you
were entitled to for somebody you didnt
even like

ABIGAIL
This is a distortion --

LISA
And the only reason youre getting the
money at all is because I started this
whole fucking thing in motion Im sorry
for swearing but you should be willing to
trade in all the money for getting this guy
off the street --

EMILY
For getting him Abigail

ABIGAIL
Well Im sorry but I have a responsibility
to Monica and I take that responsibility
very seriously You are talking about an
offer that is gonna be withdrawn if we
dont do something about it right now
(MORE )

ABIGAIL (CONTD)
And rather than being abused over the
telephone and cursed at for having the
courtesy to involve you in these
discussions Lisa I would hope you would
be guided by our judgement Unless Im
wrong about that

LISA
None of that matters --

ABIGAIL
Unless Im wrong about that Just what is
your interest in this

LISA
Because Im the one who killed her Im
the one who killed her But at least I
know I did it and that guy has no idea
And hes wandering around blaming everybody
else and all I want is for somebody to let
him know that what he did was wrong And
if they dont fire him and all you want is
the money and the police wont do anything
how is he gonna know hes wrong You cant
’ take the deal Abigail It wasnt so you
could get any money it was because we
wanted to get him fired It doesnt matter
about the money You wouldnt have gotten
it before

ABIGAIL
Well it may not matter to you but where I
come from three hundred and fifty thousand
dollars is an awful lot of money and to my
mind is a positive result of all this
tragedy and not just negative Not just
getting someone fired for one mistake no
matter how bad it was --

LISA
Oh SHOVE IT UP YOUR ASS

She knocks the speaker phone off the desk and runs to the
door in floods of tears mo

DEUTSCH and EMILY
Lisa

moralistic cunt

but Lisa wont look at her or interact

173 INT METROPOLITAN OPERA -- ORCHESTRA NIGHT 173
Lisa hurries down the long aisle The LIGHTS DIM The
audience applauds the entering conductor She picks her way
past the other patrons in the row whispering Excuse me and
takes her seat just as the MUSIC STARTS Joan looks at her
Lisa stares straight ahead
The curtain rises On stage the two women start singing the

barcarole Belle Nuit Its very beautiful

Joan looks next to her at Lisa Lisa is trying not to cry
but tears are dripping slowly down her face She sniffs and
wipes them away but they keep coming

Joan looks at her again but Lisa still wont look at her
Joan takes Lisas hand and Lisa breaks down completely
clutching Joans hand back squeezing it hard Joan starts
crying too out of sympathy

As the duet goes on they sit side by side holding hands Lisa
erying and holding on and wiping her eyes with her free hand
and Joan crying too but not as hard grateful finally that
the spell has been broken

The duet ends and we CUT TO BLACK

THE END
