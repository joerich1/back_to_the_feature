“NEAR DARK”

FADE IN

A MOSQUITO alights on a human arm

The stinger injects in the warm flesh

The insectile body becomes full and red as it sucks the blood
The fist of the arm clenches

The forearm muscles tighten

Trapping the stinger

The mosquito struggles to pull its needlike appendage free
The tendons of the arm hold it firm

Forcing blood into it

The insect struggles

Blood engorges it swelling its body

It swells

Swells

POPS in a SPRITZ of blood

CALEB
Dumb suck

INT FLATBED - FORD PICKUP - DUSK

CALEB COLTON is stretched out on the beat up broke down 64
Ford Pickup

Cowboy boots crossed on the transom

Hat dipped low over his face

He is a strapping young farmboy of 18

Long dusty shoulder length hair

An all-American milkbread midwestern farm kid

Bored off his ass

He yawns and swings off the back of the truck

EXT OKLAHOMA FLATLANDS - DUSK

The pickup is a funnel of dust on the thin strip of road

The wide open bleak emptiness of the fields as far as the eye
can see

An awesome country sunset spreading out across the sprawling
barren landscape in fingers of red shadows

EXT FIX OKLAHOMA - NIGHT

The Ford Pickup drifts into town

Sweeping past a dirty disheveled metal sign reading Welcome
to Fix Oklahoma Pop 274

Slowing down along the Main street which is a long strip of
service road running off the highway

A single gas station

A Pit Stop Burger joint with cars parked outside
A huge granary with tall stilt silos
If youre driving by and you blink you miss it
The boy in the Pickup cruises into the Pit Stop

EXT PIT STOP BURGER JOINT - NIGHT

Tacky bright orange day glo neon type of place

Couple other FARM KIDS in pickups and jeeps pulled in
Lounging around smoking cigarettes swigging beer

The Pickup cuts a curve into the parking space in a shower of
gravel

Caleb jumps out

Has a casual look around him

Like he wouldnt piss if his pants were on fire

He lights up a Marlboro

Deep heels it up to the window

Leans back on his elbows on the counter

The orange haired WAITRESS behind the window looks irritatedly
at the farmboy

WAITRESS
You gonna stand there or you gonna
order

Caleb speaks over his shoulder

CALEB
If I never see another burger again
Ill be happy

The waitress shakes her head

The farmboy distractedly eyes the lanky rangy kids loping up to
him

One with freckles on his face LEVON knocks Calebs hat off his
head

Caleb catches his hat and socks the boy in the arm

LEVON
Whats eating you

CALEB
Your Mama Y oughta keep an eye on
her Levon

LEVON
You wish

CALEB
Wish I may wish I might wish I be
hundred thousand miles from here
tonight Goddamn straight
LEVON
Take off

CALEB
Might just

The farmboys gaze drifts across the street to the

EXT TASTY FREEZE - NIGHT

Lit blue and white beneath bright fluorescent bulbs

A GIRL turns from the window

An ice cream cone in her hand

A tiny line of the frosty cream dripping down the side of her
mouth

Caleb stares at the girl

She runs a hand through thick shiny brown hair brushing it
back off her forehead

Exposing her face

Heart shaped

Impossibly pale skin in the fluorescent glow

Wide eyes a depthless ice blue like a sunny summer sky

A small mouth out of which a narrow red tongue swipes at the
melting cone in her hands

She looks to be in her late teens

A faded cowboy shirt fits snugly across her chest

A pair of Levis meet a dusty pair of black cowboy boots
Those blue eyes lift and light on Calebs face

EXT PIT STOP BURGER JOINT - NIGHT

A shiver runs up Calebs spine

A shiver that feels good

He claps Levon on the shoulder nodding his head toward the girl
at the Tasty Freeze

CALEB
Im in love

LEVON
Im dreaming

CALEB
Keep dreaming

Caleb pushes away from the counter and walks across the street

EXT TASTY FREEZE - NIGHT

The fluorescent light catches the girls eye and blazes as she
turns her back
Caleb pulls into position beside her
He hesitates suddenly loosing his nerve
Then the swagger returns

CALEB
Excuse me but Ima little lost

Could you tell me where the nearest

Tasty Freeze is Im just dyin
a cone

The girl looks around
Calebs breath catches in his throat
Those ice blue eyes gazing up at him

GIRL
Dying

Caleb gazes into that face that lights up the night

CALEB
Its hot out

GIRL
This is cold

Referring to the ice cream cone

CALEB
Could I have a bite

GIRL
A bite

Caleb shifts weight from one foot to the other nervously

Working hard
Mind scrambling

CALEB

I never seen you before Youre not

from around here are you

GIRL
No

CALEB
Got a name

GIRL
Mae

Caleb swallows

His face turns hot

Maes eyes skate to his face
And shimmer
CALEB
Where you from Mae

She wipes her mouth with the back of her hand

MAE

CALEB

MAE
Yeah

CALEB

MAE
Friends

CALEB

MAE
Friends

She looks Caleb in the eyes

MAE
Im staying out at the trailer park
near the highway I need a lift
home

Caleb looks at her a long moment
Looking like he died and went to heaven

EXT FORD PICKUP - NIGHT

Caleb opens the door for Mae
Helps her up into her seat
Then climbs behind the wheel

INT FORD PICKUP - NIGHT

The farmboy FIRES up the engine
Steers out onto the road

CALEB
My names Caleb

MAE
Thats a nice name
CALEB
Ysure are pretty but I guess a lot
of people tell you that

She looks away out the windshield

Hard to read

Soon its just the two of them driving down the dark and
deserted highway

He looks at her

His breath sticks in his throat

Mae is unearthly beautiful in the haloish haze of the dashboard
lights

Her eyes shift to him

CALEB
You got a boyfriend

MAE
Sometimes

CALEB
What about other times

MAE
What about them

CALEB
Well I dont have a girlfriend

MAE
Too bad
CALEB
How long you planning to stay around
here
MAE
Not long
CALEB

But youre not leaving tonight

MAE
No

CALEB
You th-

MAE

Shhhhhhhh
They drive in silence for several moments
The reassuring RUMBLE of the ENGINE

The WHIZZ of the TIRES on the blacktop
Outside the long far dark

The two of them together

MAE
Stop the truck

CALEB
Here

MAE
Now

CALEB
Sure

He pulls the vehicle to the side of the road
He turns to her

Her icy blue eyes radiating heat

His heart coming out of his chest

CALEB
So

MAE
Something I want to show you

Her door is all at once open
She is out of the truck
He kills the engine and jumps onto the hard ground

EXT FIELD - NIGHT

Mae stands alone

A black silhouette against a blacker horizon

A sky stretching high above her head

Stars like from a shotgun blast

He comes toward her

The WIND whips the clothes around her soft sultry form
Her eyes shining in the night

CALEB
What did you want to show me

MAE
The night

CALEB
What about it
MAE
Its dark

CALEB
Noticed

MAE

CALEB

CALEB

MAE
Listen again Do ya hear

CALEB

MAE
The night Its deafening

CALEB
Hold your ears

MAE
Listen hard

They are close

Face to face

His lips lowering to hers
Her lips moist

Wet

Parting

Caleb tries to kiss her
Mae moves off

He follows

CALEB
Havent met many girls like you
MAE
You havent met any girls like me

CALEB
Maybe not

He has a loose game grin on his face as he walks after the
girl

She walks with an easy lazy gait

Plucking a cats tail from the field

Putting it between her teeth

A sweet smile beneath the pale moonlight

Mae casts a glance over her shoulder at the smitten boy behind
her

MAE
Look up

CALEB
Stars

MAE

See that one

CALEB
First one I laid eyes on

MAE
The light you just saw took a billion
whole years to get from that star
down here to earth The light
thats leaving that star right now
itll be here a billion years from
now

She spins on her heel
Fixes his face in her own

MAE
Want to know why you never met a girl
like me before

CALEB
Yeah

She casts a glance up at the stars

MAE
-I1ll be around to see that light
when it comes down to earth a billion
years from now
CALEB
Sounds like fun

MAE
It is

CALEB
Id like to be there too

MAE
Maybe

CALEB
How

MAE

Who knows

She turns and heads back toward the Ford Pickup
He catches her stride

CALEB
Sure havent met anyone like you
before

MAE

Sure havent

They climb in
They take off
The night is just as dark as it was before
Maybe darker

INT FORD PICKUP - NIGHT

Caleb leans back in his seat raising his right arm to Maes

shoulder
Extending his fingers he ruffles her hair

CALEB
In any hurry to get home

The truck drives on
Mae lifts thoses shimmering eyes to his face

MAE
I never hurry

Caleb smiles and shakes his head somehow now believing

CALEB
--You want to listen to the radio

His fingers twirl a ribbon of her hair
He gives the knob a flick
The speakers vibrate
The Pickup speeds on into the night
The lonesome road stretching into the horizon
The RADIO playing

EXT ROAD - NIGHT

The road forks
The truck veers to the right

INT FORD PICKUP - NIGHT

Mae turns to Caleb
The paleness of her skin almost luminescent

MAE
Wherere we going

Calebs eyes sparkle

CALEB
Youll see

MAE
I dont like surprises

CALEB
Youll like this one

MAE
What is it

CALEB
Not what

MAE
Who

CALEB

Youll see

MAE
Im not sure Im going to like this

A smile in her eyes

CALEB
Im sure
EXT COLTON FARM —- NIGHT

The Pickup barrels around a junction of the highway
Funneling a cloud of dust onto a narrow dirt road
RATTLING a broken down mailbox sitting atop a short post
The farm sleeping still and dark

INT FORD PICKUP - NIGHT

Caleb steers past the house

Braking in a shower of dust in front of the pasture behind the
barn

He kills the engine

CALEB
Were here

MAE
Wheres here

CALEB
Cmon

He swings the door open

EXT PASTURE - COLTON FARM - NIGHT

Caleb races around the truck cracking open Maes door
He extends his hand as she hops out

CALEB
Close your eyes take hold of my
hand Youre going to meet my best
friend

She tugs his hand

MAE
I dont want to be with other people
I want to be with you tonight

He gives her hand a gentle pull

CALEB
Its not a person Close your eyes

She does

Letting herself be led out of the vehicle

He leads her blind back through a maze of fences out in the
pasture
EXT HORSE PEN - NIGHT

In its pen DIESEL a massive black quarterhorse pricks up his
ears

Turning wide dark eyes on Caleb and Mae

Caleb gets behind Mae and puts his hand on her shoulder

CALEB
Now I dont want you opening your
eyes

He puts his other hand over her eyes

A big smile on his face as he edges her forward
Suddenly the horse backs so abruptly it almost trips
Eyes wild with fear

The two people just stand there

The farmboy pulls his hand away from the girls eyes
He walks up to the pen

CALEB
Diesel what the hell is wrong with
you
Mae opens her eyes
MAE

Horses dont like me
Caleb takes a rope and slings it over Diesels head

CALEB
Why not

MAE
They just dont

CALEB
Come on boy

He gives the rope a tug
Diesel rears back lifting his chest front hooves pawing the
air

CALEB
Hes just acting up Hell like you
Just watch

He vaults the fence

Diesel shies

Caleb tries to shush it

The horse shakes its head back and forth scared out of its
skin

Bewildered the farmboy lifts the rope over its head
The horse pivots on its back feet tearing off
Caleb heads back toward Mae
Climbing back over the fence and standing beside her
Her watching him with uncannily even eyes
Smiling elusively to herself she turns her back to him
Moving off with an easy gait past the other pens
Inside the fences there is a SCURRYING of animals
A sudden RUSTLING in the nearby tundra of the prairie
Caleb scans the landscape sets his eyes on Mae then shakes his
head and shrugs
Mae is sauntering away her back to him running her finger
along the fence posts
The farmboy swings the lasso lariet style over his head
Letting the loop fall over the girls shoulders
She looks over her shoulder at him
Her eyes cool
He smiles
Starts reeling her in
She backs
A smile slipping across her face

CALEB
Youre pretty strong

He gives the rope another tug
Moving her closer
The moon shines bright and high overhead

MAE
Stronger than you

CALEB
Show me

She pulls back

Pulling him to her

He gives a gentle tug

She comes within reach

Then twists back

A game of give and take

He comes forward

Gathering up the rope in his hands
Their eyes wedded

She is just in front of him now

He gives one last tug on the line
Drawing her in

His face drifting toward hers
Letting his lips brush over hers and stops
Her eyes close

His hands fold around her back

A cloud passes over the moon
A shadow crosses their faces

Her soft moist lips slide over his mouth

Nuzzling down the side of his neck

He lifts closed eyes to the sky

Her breath warm on his skin

His skin trembling with the touch

Her lips start to draw back

She jerks her head back struggling with her instinct
Lifting her arms yanking the rope off her shoulders

CALEB
Whats wrong

Mae hugs her arms
Her eyes holding his
Time standing still

EXT FARMLANDS - PRE-DAWN

Horizon lightening
Just a tad

EXT FENCE - COLTON FARM - PRE-DAWN

A Rooster throws back its combed head and COCK-A-DOODLE-DOOS

EXT HORSE PEN - COLTON FARM - PRE-DAWN

Maes ears perk at the rooster crow
Her icy blue eyes skate up to the sky
Her face focuses on Calebs in alarm

MAE
What time is it

Caleb shrugs his shoulders

CALEB
What time you gotta be home

MAE
Before dawn

CALEB
Dawns a ways off

Mae spins on her heel
Heads off for the truck

MAE
Take me home Caleb

CALEB
Huh

He trots after her

Lays a hand on her shoulder
Stopping her movement
Turning her around

Her eyes blaze into his face

CALEB
Whats the rush Mae

MAE
I have to go

She breaks free

Keeps walking

Reaching the truck she opens her door

His eyes search hers as she climbs into the seat
Reading nothing

He closes her door

Resting his elbows on the open windowframe

He starts to speak she cuts him off

MAE
Hurry Caleb Hurry

He gazes into those eyes for a fleeting moment then moves
around to the drivers side and swings onto the seat

INT FORD PICKUP - PRE-DAWN

Caleb puts his hand on the keys in the ignition
Giving her a good hard look

CALEB
I dont know whats goin on Mae

She flits a peek out the window

EXT PASTURE - COLTON FARM - PRE-DAWN

The truck sits unshielded beneath the big sky becoming light
grey

INT FORD PICKUP - PRE-DAWN

Mae shoots a scared glance at Caleb

MAE
Lets go
CALEB
Were going

The farmboy TURNS over the ENGINE

Upset he shoves the stick into gear

Swinging the truck around

Stepping on the gas he takes them out of there

CALEB
Hope I didnt forget my manners or
nothin’

MAE

Thats not it
She casts a glance up out the windshield

MAE
Move

CALEB
Yes Maam

His brow furrows in confusion
He swings the steering wheel hand over hand

Driving out onto the road

EXT ROAD - PRE-DAWN

The truck burns down the tarmac toward the brightening horizon

INT FORD PICKUP - PRE-DAWN

Caleb keeps his hands on the wheel

Staring straight out the windshield

Hurt

Mae sits rigidly beside him

Perspiration like dew drops on her porcelain skin
Real fear in her eyes

MAE
Faster

CALEB
I got her floored

MAE
Its only a few more miles

CALEB
Might even get there you never know

MAE
I didnt notice the time

CALEB
Whats got you so worried

Maes eyes never leave the windshield
She answers him with silence

CALEB
Cmon what is it Your old man
gonna whip your butt or somethin
Ill tell him the car broke down

MAE
Just get me home

CALEB
Maybe I will

He puts his foot on the brake
A playful gleam in his eye

EXT ROADSIDE - PRE-DAWN

The truck pulls to a halt
Sunrise a matter of moments

INT FORD PICKUP - PRE-DAWN

Caleb yanks the keys out the ignition
Sticks them down his shirt
Sits back and crosses his arms

CALEB
---But you have to kiss me first

Anxiety squirms her pretty face

She reaches over and tries to pull the keys from inside
shirt

Her hands all over his chest

He grabs her by the wrist

Tugs her to him

Grinning boyishly ear to ear

CALEB
You got the idea

She struggles

He kisses her full on the lips

Mae shuts her eyes

Surrendering to something spasming inside her

his

Her mouth moves to his neck

Her lips pull back

Her teeth fasten onto his neck

Caleb cries out

Tries to push her off

She holds him firm by the shoulders in an iron grip
Tears explode out of her eyes

She rips her blood moistened lips from his neck
Shearing herself away from him

Plunging out the door of the truck

Headfirst

Caleb remains in the seat

Rubbing his throat

Fingering the pinprick of a wound

Surprised and astonished he jumps out of the parked vehicle
Chasing after the panic-stricken girl scrambling away

EXT ROAD - PRE-DAWN

The girl is running as fast as her feet will carry her

Her eyes wide and wild

A dribble of blood dappling her white lips

The farmboy is racing after her

She moves with a speed that is leaving him rapidly in her wake
The sky is becoming very bright indeed

Mae stops in her tracks and squints ahead

Up the road fast approaching

A ballooning cloud of dust

A low to the ground funnel of dirt

Caleb watches as the girl runs toward it flagging her arms
A vehicle inside the little twister SLAMS on its BRAKES

Mae jumps inside the dirty haze

The dust cloud swerves in a SCREECHING TIRE arc on the roadway
speeding back up the road

The sun about to crack the edge of the world

A faint wreath of smoke in the air where the girl last stood
Caleb slows to a sprint

Then a walk

He stops and stands

Watching the dust disintigrate up the road

He scratches his head

Touches the strange wound on his throat

He regards the red wetness on his fingers

CALEB
Some kiss

He shrugs and hikes back to his truck
Hops into the cab

INT FORD PICKUP - PRE-DAWN

Caleb turns the keys in the ignition
WHINNNEEEEE

WHINNNNNNNNEEEE

WHINNEEEEE

He checks out the gas gauge

Empty

He punches the dashboard

CALEB
Shit

He jumps out of the truck

EXT ROAD - PRE-DAWN

Caleb crosses the blacktop

Leaving the truck on the side of the road
Hiking into the dry fields

His house a small speck on the field far away
He heads toward it

The sun near up

EXT COLTON FARM - PRE-DAWN

LOY and SARAH COLTON have come outside to start their day

The father is a man in his middle years with weathered skin and
white hair on a face and body worn by a life on the land

He is holding his six year old daughter in his arms

Golden hair on a pretty pug nosed face

Loy is holding a cup of coffee

Sippng it as he looks out on the morning lands with his baby
girl

Sky brightening

EXT FIELD —- PRE-DAWN

The edge of the world turns white

Caleb clomps through the field

Squinting ahead to see the small shape of the farmhouse
The specks of two people standing out front

Home a half mile away

The boy trudges toward it

The world brightening around him

He hugs himself

The light making his skin sore

The sun crests the rim of the planet

Spreading an infinite wall of light across the big country
A wave of sharp sunlight splashing over the running boy
He lets out a cry of pain
EXT COLTON FARM —- DAWN

Loy Colton squints out into the lands
Sees the stick figure way out there
Sarah stretches her teeny arm and points
Jumps up and down

SARAH
Lookit Daddy Caleb

LOY
Hey Caleb

The father waves at his son
The sister stands by his side

The two of them framed picture pretty in front of the house

EXT FIELD — DAWN

Caleb squirms in agony

Staggering across the fields

Blisters and burn marks scorching on his skin

The sun roasting his flesh

Searing his face and hair

He runs drunkenly

His arms stretched out

His hands reaching for the two of his family members

And his house

Like a pastoral postcard of home a quarter of a mile away
Smoke rises from his fingers

His skin stinging

His whole body burning up in the abruptly scarifying light of
day

He screams his lungs out

His arms covering his face

Sizzling

EXT COLTON FARM —- DAWN

Loy stops waving

His face falls

Sarah snags his shirt sleeve
Alarmed

SARAH
Is something wrong with Caleb

LOY
Im not sure

They squint into the distance
Past the stumbling smoking stick figure of Caleb

Just past him
Dust rising

EXT FIELD — DAWN

Tears stream down Calebs cheeks

His smouldering raw hands outstretched

Snatching clenching for the too far figures of his father and
his sister

Fighting his way past the warring wall of the sun

His feet becoming harder and harder to move

Fighting a losing battle against the agonizing scorch of
daylight

The SOUND of an AUTOMOTIVE ENGINE behind him

He looks desperately over his shoulder

A balloon of dirt

A pale ghostly cream colored Winnegabo is bearing down on him
Almost upon him

He knows it is useless to resist

He surrenders his eyes rolling up into their sockets

His legs giving out from under him

Knees buckling

The recreational vehicle lumbers by

Its side door swinging open

Three sets of hands clamping around Calebs limp body as he
drops

Heaving the door shut

Speeding off

EXT COLTON FARM —- DAWN

Loy and Sarach are thunderstruck

They see the Winnebago hang a sharp right in an explosion of
dirt

Greyhounding it for the strip of two-lane blacktop a quarter of
a mile away

Caleb being stolen away within

SARAH
Caleb

LOY
Sarah you stay here

Loy charges as fast as his aging feet will carry him across the
farm

Around the side of the barn

Screeching to a halt in front of a Chevy Pickup

The Truck is up on a jack its tire off

The father is white in the face

Sarah is standing beside him with her eyes as big as saucers
Watching the thin trail of dust disappear down the road

The father picks up his daughter
She hugs him sobbing
A steeliness appears behind his eyes as he looks out at the
road
The two of them stand small and alone on the farm
Surrounded by the huge Oklahoma landscape

INT WINNEBAGO - DAWN

The sun is a twisted green ball through the glass windshield
Its deadly rays leaking inside

Caleb twists a groggy face upward lifting his lids

To see the sharp bladed rowel of a shining silver spur stuck
against his throat

It is connected to a boot

Attached to a steamshovel of a leg in black jeans

Part of the body of a stapping sinewy man with a mean skullish
face and eyes like dead meat

SEVEREN VAN SICKLE

SEVEREN
Howdy

He puts pressure on the spur pricking flesh

SEVEREN
-Im gonna separate your head from
yer shoulders Hope ya dont
mindnone

Caleb gags

A snarl from somebody beneath a blanket behind the wheel
Severen grunts and reluctantly looses the pressure on the spur a
bit

Mae heaves a blanket over Caleb who isnt moving a single
solitary muscle

His eyes jump to the driver who is speeding the Winnebago at a
flat-out 100

JESSE HOOKERs head swivels over his shoulder deeply hooded by
a blanket and eyes covered by very black welding glasses

A guantly handsome man with a face like the flip side of a
nickel and a long mane of hair the color of burnished pewter

JESSE
You fucked us up but good Mae

MAE
It was kinda an accident

JESSE
This was sloppy Mae real sloppy

Severen indents the sharp rowel of the spur in Calebs throat
The farmboy is scared beyond belief

SEVEREN
Let me do it Jesse let me tap dance
on it woncha Jess Itll be so
good

JESSE
Do it fast

In the seat beside Jesse another head rises

The blanket parting to reveal a face to put a country boy in his
place

A head of metallic blonde hair over chiseled features as if from
marble

Her full bloodless lips widen in a silky smile

Her eyes an intoxicating lethal lure

DIAMONDBACKs studded denim and fringe jacket glints like snake
eyes in the dark

She whips out her wrist and a pearl handled blade pops into her
hand

She readies to use it

DIAMONDBACK
Let the good times roll

Mae grabs her arm

MAE
No

Calebs eyes are wide and wild

Severen draws his leg back poising his spur

The Winnebago hurtles at hi-speed

The farmboy tries to make a move

CLINK

CHINK

Handcuffs are thrown about his wrist and a bolt on the door
Hes caught tight

His eyes find a 38 special aimed point blank in his face
Held in a two hand grip by a seven year old boy

Crouched in a corner

A tiny face pinched hair clipped in a crewcut

His clothes probably procured at the Salvation Army
HOMER

He eases back the hammer

Snaps his eyes possessively to Mae

HOMER
Him
MAE
No
Spur
Knife
Handcuff

Nuts
CALEB

SEVEREN
Aint whats goin on son Its
whats coming off Your face Clean
off

Severens face splits with a smile like a cut neck

Slashing out with his spur for Calebs throat to lay it wide
open

Mae suddenly puts her face in front of the farmboys

The Savage One stops his spur an inch from her pretty pale
throat

She holds his gaze

MAE
Might as well kill me

SEVEREN
How you figure that

Mae yanks Calebs head aside displaying the red ringed teeth

marks in his neck

MAE
Hes been bit but he aint been bled

That sinks in

MAE
--Hes turned by now

SEVEREN
Aw shit Jess If hes turned

JESSE
-He comes with us

Caleb is perfectly still

His eyes the only part of his body that moves
Back and forth back and forth

Nobody talks

Nobody moves
Black nervous looks all around
The vehicle drives on

EXT ABANDONED GAS STATION - DAWN

The pale Winnebago takes a sharp right and grinds to a stop well
within the darkened innards of a derelict deserted garage
A lightless chamber

INT WINNEBAGO - DAWN

Jesse and Diamondback pop back the front seats into almost
horizontal positions

Ready themselves for sleep

Severen unhinges the bunks on the walls of the van

He climbs into the top WHIZZING a spur in Calebs direction
Homer shoves up into the one beneath

Casting a grim eye on the farmboy as he pulls the blanket up
over his head

Mae rests a hand gently on the boys shoulder

He gazes up into her eyes

Suddenly very tired

Heavily weighted but somehow floating at the same time

He fights to keep his eyes open

They shut

Mae covers both their bodies with the blanket

Sleep steals her too

EXT FIELD - COLTON FARM - DAY

Sun burning hot and bright on a sign reading Loy Colton
Veterinarian

A POLICE CAR sitting in front of the farmhouse

Down in the field Loy cradles Sarah in his arms and gazes
straight into SHERIFF EAKERS face

The Sheriff tucks a couple of thumbs in the belt around his
landslide girth

Tilting an eye

SHERIFF EAKERS
Kidnapped Cmon Loy your boys
eighteen Might be he figured to
take himself some time on his own I
see it all the day

Sarah sniffles

Loy looks down to the ground and the fresh tire marks in the raw
earth

Shaking his head

Eakers glances down at the marks dismissively

Shifting his weight from one foot to the other

SHERIFF EAKERS
By the way Doc you mind taking a
look at my mare Shes all swole up
on her back needs a shot maybe

Loy looks at his watch in annoyance
Then stabs the ground with the toe of his boot

LOY
See these tire marks That was four
hours and nine minutes ago Meanin
that if theyre out there on the
highway keepin at a steady 55 that
puts ‘em clear into the next state by
now I wanna know what you boys are
doin about that

Sarah digs her face into her stern fathers jacket
The Sheriff sighs

The three of them very small on the very big stretch of land

EXT ABANDONED GAS STATION - DUSK

The sun settles on the decrepit shell of a gas station off a
lonesome road

The sky dims

The night begins

INT WINNEBAGO - NIGHT

Calebs eyes blink open

He keeps them almost closed

Playing dead

He fingers his burn wounds

They are barely there

Nearly healed

The five silhouettes of the rest in the dashboard lights
Huddling

Low voices

He listens close

MAE
-eI1ll look after him

HOMER
You cant Mae I turned you I
taught you

MAE

I turned him Im teachin him

SEVEREN

Risky as shit Jess He fucks up

its our ass

DIAMONDBACK

If its our ass Mae its your ass

JESSE
Well

The glint of Jesses eyes passing around the others

JESSE
-You want to call it a week

Mae holds her breath
Severen spits tobacco

Homer keeps opening and closing the hammer of the gun
Diamondback fingers the rhinestone studs of her frayed blue

denim jacket

Jesse clicks his teeth

His eyes snap to Diamondback
She nods

JESSE

-Then its decided A week to see

if we can call him one of us

Caleb blinks
Severen catches it

SEVEREN

Cut the shit I know youre awake

I can smell it

All eyes turn to him

Eyes that can see in the dark

Caleb opens his eyes

Severen gets to his feet

Stands over him

Whips out a straightrazer

The farmboys stomach tightens

Severen spits on his palm

Smears the saliva over his rough hewn face
Starts shaving himself with the open blade

SEVEREN

slicing whiskers

-Amazin how fast they get dull

The Savage One sticks out his hand
Yanks the farmboy to his feet

Homer unlatches his handcuff
Caleb rubs his wrist

CALEB
IF IM SLEEPING SLAP ME CAUSE I WANNA
WAKE UP

SEVEREN

Guess what

CALEB
WHO ARE YOU PEOPLE

JESSE

Caleb hears a sound which makes him turn his head fast
ZZ2Z2Z22222224222z2z2ZzZ2zZaaaaawww
AZ2ZZZZ2ZZZ22ZZZ2Z2ZZAAAAWWWWWWWZZ2ZZZ

Severen FILING his teeth with a metal tool

Sharpening them

Winking at the farmboy

SEVEREN
Severen Van Sickles the name

Diamondback flexes her wrist

Shooting her pearl handled blade out of her cuff and into her
hand

She flexes her wrist

The blade drops back in her jacket

She flexes her wrist again

Blade in hand

DIAMONDBACK
Diamondback

Caleb is looking at her

A teeny hand grabs him by the nuts

Clenches hard

He groans

Falls to his knees

Eye level with Homer

Who puts his little face fiercely against Calebs

HOMER
Im Homer Thats H-O-M-E-R
Mispronounce it once and I wouldnt
want to be you
Mae takes the stunned speechless Caleb and sits him down on a

seat in the back

He starts to say something

She puts her finger to his lip

The Silvered One turns over the ignition

EXT ABANDONED GAS STATION - NIGHT

The Winnebago rides out of the gutted garage

EXT USED CAR LOT - NIGHT

The Winnebago slows to a stop in front of the lot

EXT USED CAR LOT - NIGHT

Severen moves silently through the rows of vehicles in the
safety of shadow with a well practised ease

EXT TWO-LAND HIGHWAY - NIGHT

The Winnebago streaks through the night
A light green TRAVELALL on its tail
Small towns come and go

Giving way to dust covered plains stretching to the horizon

EXT BARREN FIELDS - NIGHT

The Winnebago has been torched

It is a smouldering skeleton of flickering flames

The red taillights of the Travelall racing toward the road
Shrinking from view

EXT KANSASOKLAHOMA BORDER - ROAD - NIGHT
The Travelall speeds across the state line

EXT HOPE KANSAS - NIGHT

The Travelall weaves through the streets of the small city

INT PARKING STRUCTURE - HOPE KANSAS - NIGHT

The Travelall pulls into the parking structure
Zooming through the cement catacombs

Swerving into a parking spot

Shutting its engine

All doors pop open

They all climb out

And stretch their legs

Jesse turns a grey eye on the farmboy

A faint grin wrinkles across that epic face
Caleb swallows

Mae comes up beside him

Weaving her fingers through his hand

The farmboy watches as the others take off into the night
Each heading in separate directions

EXT STREETS - NIGHT

Caleb and Mae walk along the empty lonely street beneath the
yellowish glow of the mercury vapor light
City lights glisten up ahead

CALEB
Wherere we going

MAE
Ill show you

CALEB
Where

MAE
There

She nods toward the city in front of her

CALEB
Why

MAE
Ill show you

His eyes dim
A nausea welling up inside him

CALEB
I dont feel too well

MAE
I know

He looks at her

Probing inside those ice blue eyes
Then down at himself

The burns on his arms healed

His clothes singed

Another wave of nausea

It makes him want to scream

He stops in his tracks

CALEB
Look Mae you got to understand
Im gettin outa here Im going to

the nearest bus station and takin
the next one back home

He takes a step toward the girl
Holding her by the shoulders

CALEB
I know you tried to help me But I
got to get home

Touching a finger to her cheek

He turns his back

Taking off down the street

A knowing passes behind the girls eye

MAE
Caleb you wont get very far

From halfway down the street he looks back
Hurt anger and fear streaking his face

CALEB
Well see

MAE
You know where I1l be

CALEB
Be seeing you

Quietly

MAE
Before long

Caleb lifts a hand in a slight wave
Casting a last look at the girl
And her melting gaze

Then he is gone

The night moves on

Mae stands still

EXT BUS STATION - NIGHT

The depot in the middle of nowhere on the empty streets of the
small midwestern town

Caleb shambles along the sidewalk toward it

Pushing through the double glass doors

INT WAITING ROOM - BUS STATION - NIGHT

The farmboy walks up to the ticket counter
The TICKETER doesnt give him a second glance

CALEB
Um excuse me

The man turns not eyeing the worse for wear boy any differently
than he would any of the other wierdos up and around at that
time

CALEB
--Id like to know if you got any
buses going through Fix Oklahoma
round about now

The Ticketer just stares

TICKETER
Where the hell is Fix

CALEB
Well nearest city is Lawton

The man nods

TICKETER

Caleb opens his wallet and counts

CALEB
I got 11 dollars

The Ticketer pulls the ticket back bored

TICKETER
I got a bus ticket for 14

CALEB
I gotta get home Gimme a break
man

TICKETER

Youre three bucks shy

CALEB
How ‘bout it

The farmboy exhales as the salesperson goes back to watching a
portable television
His shoulders slumped Caleb walks past the rows of plastic
seats with the pay televisions on the armrests

Almost all empty

He spies a man in a rumpled suit sitting across the room
Looking at him laconically

The boy goes over

CALEB
Scuse me Sir

The man looks up

CALEB
-Ilm trying to get home and Im
three dollars short for the ticket
I was wondering if you had-

MAN
I have this

He reaches into his jacket for his wallet
Pulls it out

CALEB
Thanks

The wallet is flipped open
A badge in it

The PLAINCLOTHES COP puts his hand on the farmboys shoulder

The hand has a bandage
The bandage has blood on it
Fresh

PLAINCLOTHES COP
Come this way please

CALEB
Whats the problem

PLAINCLOTHES COP
You

INT HALLWAY - BUS STATION - NIGHT

The boy is walked into the shadowy locker area by the
Plainclothes Police Officer

PLAINCLOTHES COP
Youre not lookin too good kid

CALEB
Im not feeling too good

PLAINCLOTHES COP
Whatre you on

CALEB
You wouldnt believe me if I told
you

PLAINCLOTHES COP
Let me see your eyes

He puts his hand on Calebs face

Squints into the boys eyes

Which are perfectly clear

The blood on the small bandage near Calebs nose

Nostrils flare

His nausea clearing for an instant

The cop fingers the dark stain on the collar of the farmboys
jacket

PLAINCLOTHES COP
You got blood on you

Caleb turns his neck to the man
Exposing the small puncture wound

CALEB
I got cut

The sickness returning
The farmboy close to tears
The cop looks him in the eyes with some compassion

CALEB
--I only have 11 dollars and I need
three more or Im never gonna be able
to get back home

The policeman thinks for a moment
Then takes out his wallet
Gives the boy three dollars

PLAINCLOTHES COP
Get home an be a good boy

Caleb smiles a bright boyish smile
The plainclothes cop pats him on the shoulder
The farmboy moves off

EXT CITY LIMITS - NIGHT

The long silvery bus streaks down the highway
A half moon watches from way on high

INT BUS - NIGHT

Caleb is curled up in the backseat

Buckled in pain

His face smeared with sweat

Clenching his stomach

His veins and arteries screaming out for sustenance
His eyes peer over the edge of the window sill

He sees the parking structure pass by

Jumping to his feet he rushes down the aisle
Screeching to a sneakered halt behind the Bus Driver

CALEB
Stop the bus I gotta get off

The Bus Driver lifts his face to the sweat soaked farmboy

BUS DRIVER
You get off youre left

The pain in Calebs eyes needs no words
The driver downgrades as he swings over to the curb

EXT STREETS ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF HOPE KANSAS - NIGHT

The huge lumbering vehicle grinds to a stop on the empty
street

The doors heave open

Caleb climbs down the steps in a crouch

The Bus Driver shakes his head as the doors fold closed
In a cloud of exhaust the vehicle lurches away

Caleb grabs onto the lamppost for support

He swings his dimming eyes around

Focusing on the parking structure in the near distance

INT PARKING STRUCTURE - NIGHT

Caleb staggers out of the stairwell
Stumbling toward the light green Travelall
Sitting on the bumper in bare feet is Mae
A soft smile crosses his face

Caleb stops in front of her

Losing his balance

Weakening

CALEB
Im dying

MAE
Youre just in time

In the shadow of the overhand Mae rises to her feet before
Caleb
Her ice blue eyes fix on his
She lifts her hand to her mouth
Turning a glistening white wrist to her lips
And sinks her teeth into the skin

CALEB
Wha--

The red liquid runs down her arm as she raises the wrist to
Calebs mouth

Shutting out his voice

Fastening her skin to his face

MAE
Drink

The aroma filling his nostrils

Giving him strength

The strength giving him pleasure

Seizing him

Like two arms kidnapping his senses

As his lips look on the gaping wound of her wrist and her blood
begins to fill his veins

He clutches her with both hands rolling the fabric of her
blouse into his fists

Hearing the pounding rhythm of her heart

BABUMBABUM BABUMBABUMBABUMBABUMBABUMBABUMBABUM BABUMBABUM
Getting faster

A kind of frenzy passing behind his eyes

The blood in his own veins running hot

Stimulated

Stirred

MAE
I asked you to listen to the night
now listen to me

BABUMBABUMBABUMBABUM BABUMBABUMBABUMBABUM
The roaring in his ears

Smashing her into him

Draining her

Furiously

The blood running like fire inside him

Washing over him in waves of heat

Head reeling

Body spasming

His own heart finding its way to his ears
BABUMBABUMBABUMBABUMBABUM BABUMBABUMBABUMBABUM
Both hearts now in syncopated rhythm

A beating drum
Growing louder and louder
Its DEAFENING
The SOUND about to shatter his system
Mae beginning to pull back
He yanks her tighter
She summons the last of her strength
And rips herself free
Calebs mouth drips with the dark red liquid
Replenished
Restored
Remade
Calebs face flushes and his eyes shine with unhealthy health
Breathing hard
Panting
The new found strength swirling through his body
He reaches for the girl
She pushes his hands away gently
Then presses the wound closed on her wrist
Her eyes soft and knowing
Walking forward to the edge of the parking structure
Looking out
Caleb pulls himself together
A control returning
Standing beside the girl with a kind of gratitude in his eyes
She points
Gazing out upon the city on one side and wide expanse of
flatlands on the other
All beneath a velvety cloak of blackness

MAE
Look the night

Caleb blinks

Eyes bright

Feeling fine

Not sure of what to make of it

He squints around him

Never has the night looked as it does

He stares spellbound

A fine layer of lunar luminescence falls from the sky

The city shimmering as never before

The very electrical pulse visible as it travels through thin
air

He blinks

Turning toward the fields

He can see Owls in the air many miles away

Coyotes on the run across the barren tundra impossibly far off
Fieldmice scuttle

Rabbits skiddadle

Racoons clamber across the brushy flatlands

Caleb whirls around and around
Giggling
Then laughing
Unable to help himself
In love with the newness of the night
He stops

MAE
Now hear it

His head flicks back to the city
Suddenly VIBRATING with SOUND

CAR HORNS

ELECTRICITY TRAVELING ACROSS WIRES
TICKING OF STREET LIGHTS

HISSING OF GAS LINES

He revolves his head

To the fields

He shuts his eyes

Opens his ears

A SYMPHONY of NIGHT SOUNDS sweep in on him

MAE
Come on

She leaps over the small barrier of the parking structure and
runs out into the farmlands

Caleb on her heels

EXT FARMLANDS - NIGHT

Mae and Caleb running deep into the fields
Running like never before

Limbs flying effortlessly galloping like the wind almost
airborne covering miles in a matter of minutes
Caleb listening

A RUSH of BREEZES and WINDS whipping along the plains
The WALL of INSECTS in the AIR

The SCUTTLING of small animal FEET on the DIRT
The BRUSH of BUSHES swaying in the BREEZE

The CRY of COYOTES

Then again

COYOTES CRY

CRY

CRY

CRY

Caleb throws his head back

Cracks a grin

He lets out a YIPPING CRY himself

Maes face widens in a smile

Throwing her head back

Letting out a trilling CRY

The COYOTES yell back
Caleb and Mae see them in a pack scampering across the land
They run after them
CRYING out loud as their lungs will allow
A far off TRAIN WHISTLE
The shadow of a big Freight Train on the horizon
The boy and girls legs propelling them forward with fierce
speed
Like two steel springs
Their faces flushed with emotion as they catch up with the SIX
COYOTES on the run
The strong tan canines regard their new escorts as a kindred
spirit
Flashing their dark eyes at them in scraggy acknowledgement
YIPPING at them
Caleb and Mae YIP back
Barreling across the badlands with the running Coyotes
The padding paws
The cowboy boots slapping the ground
Then suddenly catching up with the big Freight Train
The boy and girl running side by side with the double engine
locomotive
The strange strength powering their limbs to stay abreast
The lowered brown maned wolfish heads at their heels
The Coyotes YIPPING
The train WHISTLE BLOWING
Caleb and Maes faces bright and hot blooded

Jackknifing up in bed

He puts his face in his hands

Cries quietly

He peers out the window at the first traces of sunlight through
the curtains

He looks like he has slept poorly

Loy regards the shape of a small body an indentation on the
mattress

His daughter was sleeping beside him but now shes gone
His brow furrows

A hole in the wall

A small computer bank on the desk by the telephone

A few wanted posters and postal warrants on the board

ash tray full of butts

He lifts tired eyes to Loy Colton sitting across the desk
Sarah in her fathers lap

SHERIFF EAKERS

Leaning over to put her face by the Sheriffs who is inclined
to lean back a bit

The Sheriff gets up out of his seat
He walks over to the water cooler
Pours himself a cup

Chuckling to himself

His back to them

Walks away with his head hung low

INT TWO-LANE HIGHWAY - NIGHT

A long two lane stretch of blacktop into infinity

Broken white lines beneath the black void of the starless sky
Caleb storms along the roadside

The Texaco Truckstop receding behind him

His tortured conflicting emotions tearing him apart at the
seams

He shuts his eyes

Puts his hands on his ears
Screams
His lungs out
Hastening as fast as he can along the empty night road
A pair of headlights brighten on him
A truck THUNDERS past
The AFTERBLOW sweeping his clothes
Its passing headlights revealing the figure of a girl hurrying
after him
Mae rushes up the side of the road
Keeping pace with the anxiety-ridden boy
It is just the two of them way below the roof of the night

Mae stops and stands
Caleb doesnt walk much further
He turns to face her

Eyes like fire in the night

He looks at those hands then into that face
CALEB

She unveils her pearly whites in a sweet smile full of promise

To the end of time

His eyes travel up to the stars

Hers follow his gaze

Their eyes meet in a head on collision

Lips coming together

A truck RAGES past

AFTERBLOW whippping up their clothes and hair
Headlights exploding over them

Heat of the moment

The trucks taillights fade

They are alone in the big dark wide open spaces
Their lips part

question of how

Pinning him while he sinks his teeth into the startled

the side of the road with his thumb extended

The crisp white shirt over his long lean muscles buttoned up
to his throat a string tie with a turquoise clasp at the
collar

An inviting grin on his face

He runs a palm over his hair to smooth it back

His black eyes gleam

The headlights grow bright and flood his face

His grin widens

As he looks in through the windshield of an approaching dusty
Black Pickup

Severen nods

The Pickup slows

Kicking up dirt and gravel as it slams into the shoulder of the

Pressing the cold metal nose against the nape of Diamondbacks

Switches off the ignition

soft pale hair

Jesse gazes over his shoulder

Diamondback looks him in the face

Smiling calmly

Jesse shifts his gaze to the Hitchhiker

A small round CAJUN TRUCKER with long curly hair gazes over

He has a thick accent when he speaks and his words of English
are limited

He zeros in on the station again

The Sinatra song bleeding through the scratchy speakers

The Cajun chuckles

CAJUN TRUCKER

Mae lifts her pale face to his

Caleb smiles as the Cajun Trucker brings three bottles of beer
out of a bag on the floor by his boots

He hands them both bottles of Bud
They artfully pretend to drink

Mae nudges Caleb in the ribs
He looks in her face

Her eyes say kill

Sympathetically

But soon

The Cajun Driver looks at them both and Mae averts her eyes

Starting to downshift

His eyes alarmed and anxious

Now that he has to make his move he has the shakes

He shoves open the passenger door of the cab

Leaps out

Stumbles to his knees in the gravel

Heaving his guts with the gently bobbing oil pumps behind him
out in the fields

The Cajun Trucker leaps down and comes up behind the boy

Caleb gets to his feet

The stocky man looks him in the face

The farmboy bares his teeth but its no good
He cant do it

Then he sees her

Hovering up behind the Cajun Truckers shoulder
She uses her mouth

EXT HIGHWAYSIDE FIELDS - NIGHT

An oil pump dips and rises

Mae stands before it

A gentle WIND ruffling her dress
Caleb is kneeling at her feet
His lips fastened on her wrist
Sucking

Drinking
Sucking
Drinking
The fury almost rocking his body
A rabid fierceness with which he feeds
Mae gently strokes his head
Then nudges him away
He is locked tight
Draining her
Hearts pounding
She pushes with all her might
Rips his lips free
Her glistening eyes on his hungry face

MAE
You could kill me if you drink too
much

His upturned eyes gaping at her face
Mind spinning

Gulping air

The black night hangs heavy above
Stars dapple the surface

The oil pump keeps rising and falling

INT BOBS BIG BOY - WACO TEXAS - DAY

A cloverleaf of freeways through the window

Sarah and Loy are eating breakfast at one of the booths

The little girl clicks open a pen and starts sketching a rough
but recognizable picture of her brother on the back of his
horse

She starts to cry

Loy pushes away his plate of an uneaten hamburger and reaches
across the table

He cups her little face in his hands

LOY
Shhh honey Come on lets go make
a phone call see if anybody knows
anything

She sniffles and nods

INT PAY PHONE - BOBS BIG BOY - DAY

Loy holds Sarah in his arms the telephone receiver to his ear

LOY

LOY
---You did Its a positive make

His face brightens
His little daughter wipes her eyes

LOY

He hangs up the phone
Sarah wears a big smile on her face as she tightens her arms
around her fathers neck

SARAH

LOY
Almost

Hope flushes their faces as they head toward the Chevy Pickup
Driving into the hot afternoon sun

EXT CHEVY PICKUP - INTERSTATE NORTH - DAY

TIRES ZOOMING over the tarmac

SMASH CUT TO

TRAIN WHEELS RAGING across RAILS

EXT UNION PACIFIC TRAIN - KANSAS - NIGHT

Calebs head pushed closer and closer to the spark spitting
wheels

Gritting his teeth his eyes bulging up into Severens face
The Savage Ones hand in a vice grip around the farmboys neck
forcing him halfway out of the open box car

Sparks hitting Calebs face

He struggles beneath the remorseless grip
His strength no match for Severens
In a ragged snarl Severen heaves the boy back up by the neck

INT FREIGHT CAR - UNION PACIFIC TRAIN - NIGHT

The Savage One throws the farmboy up against the wall pinning
him with that same vice grip around the throat

Caleb sucks wind

Looking around him at the semi circle of darkening faces
To the icy blue eyes behind them

To Mae

His eyes plead

Hers tremor

She makes a move

Jesse revolves his silver head and gives her a look

Not a nice look

She freezes

Caleb stops breathing

The Silvered One moves forward

JESSE
One more night

Lifting a long slender finger toward the farmboys face

SEVEREN
Or Im gonna get my wet dream boy

Caleb swallows
Homer smacks his lips

HOMER
Why wait were gonna do it anyway
He aint one of us he dont belong
Besides

Turning an eye on Mae

HOMER (CONTD)
-Hes so ugly it makes my gums
ache

The girl comes forward
Squaring off in front of Jesse

MAE
He needs more time Jesse

Those steely eyes shift from the quivering farmboy to Mae
A lip curls back
JESSE
I wonder about you Mae I
shouldnt be wondering about you

A shiver runs through her system

Point taken

That long slender finger of the Silvered One sweeps back to
Caleb

JESSE
Aint right for Mae to be carrying
you Caleb Tonight you make a kill
How you do it is your business You
do it or youre done

The Savage One takes his hand off the boys throat

Giving him a look like he cant wait for the boy to screw up
Diamondback slides a harmonica out of her jacket and plays a
slow haunting melody

Then stops

Lifting her hypnotic eyes to the farmboy

DIAMONDBACK
Done means dead without dying Means
youll be real uncomfortable for a
long long time

Her lips return to the small metal instrument

The big rectangle of night rolling by the opening
Caleb moves to the door

Mae suddenly beside him

A match strikes flint nearby

Severen rolling a cigarette between his lips

Then hold on a cluster of lights in the distance
A big ROADHOUSE sitting not far from the tracks
Caleb follows Severens gaze

And understands the Savage Ones scarred face cracking into a
smile like a hatchet chop

EXT UNION PACIFIC TRAIN - NIGHT

The freight hurtles by

A hundred cars long

Six figures leap off

Landing in a heap in the middle of a wheatfield beneath a
rising moon

EXT ROADHOUSE - NIGHT

Six tall silhouettes approach
A big squat barn with a neon sign on the window

A pickup a tractor trailer a Dodge Camper and a chopped down
motorcycle parked out front

One look at the vehicles and you get a good idea of the
clientele

Bad Country Music TWANGS out of the bar

The CLINK of pool cues on balls

The six of them stand in the shadows looking at the nailed
together roadside bar

DIAMONDBACK
Lets hit the night in the face

Caleb takes a deep breath
They go in

INT ROADHOUSE - NIGHT

As soon as the six of them walk in the place stops

A BIKER at the jukebox keeps his quarter

A fat low to the ground TRUCKER at the bar turns a flattened
face over thick shoulders to regard the fresh arrivals with a
dull look

A COWBOY TEENAGER lifts his pool cue

The WAITRESS picks some empty glasses off the table in the
booth

The BARTENDER CLICKS his teeth

A quiet comes over the joint

Severen winks and elbows Caleb in the ribs

Speaking in a voice loud enough for everybody to hear

SEVEREN
Look shitkickers I1l be
Goddamned Cmon Caleb Lets get
some liquor in us Maybe theyll
look a little less stupid when
everythings blurry

Caleb gets nervous

He waves friendly to the Biker

With the attitude of a sailor on a sinking ship about to
submerge

The Biker doesnt wave back

Mae Jesse Diamondback and Homer slide into the booth
The Silvered One catches the Waitress eye and gestures for a
beer

The Savage One and the farmboy belly up to the bar
Severen slams his fist down

Making the surly Trucker spill his drink

SEVEREN
Bartender gimmie two glasses of
whatever shit you shove down these
suckers throats

The Bartender makes a big point of not looking at him
The Trucker looks at him though

TRUCKER
You spilled my drink

SEVEREN
Youve had enough By the way were
you born that ugly or is this your
mamas idea of a joke

The Trucker does a slow burn

The temperature in the bar steadily rising

The Cowboy Teenager chalks his pool cue with a SQUEAKING chalk
cube

Severen clears his throat

Caleb starts to leave

The Savage One pulls him back

He picks up the glass of the Trucker

Addresses the Bartender

SEVEREN
Give him another

The Bartender pours the Trucker another drink
Severen nudges the Trucker

SEVEREN (CONTD)
Now pay the man

The Trucker does a faster burn

SEVEREN (CONTD)
Bartender thatll be a double shot
of your very best watered down shit
over here

He taps the bar
The Bartender stares the two of them in the face

BARTENDER
Theres two ways you can leave this
establishment On your feet or on
your back asshole

Severen sighs

SEVEREN
Well if youre not going to serve me
a drink

The Savage One picks up the drink of the Trucker

SEVEREN
-e-IT1ll just hafta drink his

He throws it back

The Trucker rises to his feet
Mad

Severen makes a face

SEVEREN
Ptooo0o0c000ecee

He spits the drink in the Truckers face

SEVEREN
---How can you drink that shit

The Trucker throws a punch

Severen grabs Caleb

Swings him around

The farmboy takes the piledriver punch square in the face
He blinks

Unfazed

It was like he didnt even feel it

Severen winks at the fuming Trucker

SEVEREN
Do it again Couple times Im
tryin to show him somethin’

The Trucker connects two roundhouse blows to the side of Calebs
head

A double combination to his belly

The only thing that registers on Calebs face is surprise at his
sudden physical resilience

SEVEREN
Now hit back Caleb

The Savage One releases the boys arm

The Trucker pulls his fist back to throw another

Caleb strikes out in alarm

His fist bulldozers into the Truckers face

Knocking him clean off his feet onto his back on the pooltable
The Cowboy Teenager raises his stick to avoid him as the
unconscious body scatters the balls

Caleb regards his fists in amazement
CALEB
Did I do that

The Waitress is at the booth

Setting a glass down in front of Jesse

Three beers on the tray in her arm

A beer in her fingers as she looks at the man on the pooltable
The Silvered One whistles for her attention

JESSE
Just the glass

The Waitress shrugs

Returns the beer to the tray

She sets down the empty glass

Jesse draws an antique Colt Peacemaker from his belt
SHOOTS her in the Adams apple

She slumps in his lap

He puts the glass under her throat

Filling the glass

Dumping the body on the floor

Guzzling the glass he gets up and goes to the door
His pistol leveled

Standing sentry

JESSE
Nobody gets out of here alive

The Cowboy Teenager is totally still

Nothing but a scared kid

Holding his pool cue in white knuckled hands
Severen lets out a cowboy yodel

SEVEREN
Good times

He walks over to the bruising Biker standing like a statue by
the jukebox

SEVEREN
--This is the best time I had since
I nailed your mother backseat of your
Daddys truck He was there
watchin’

Severen taps him in the chest

SEVEREN
--Tell you the truth I think he
liked it too Know she did

The Biker snarls and grabs Severen by the throat
Severen doesnt blink an eye
He presses his two hands against the side of the Bikers head
Applying pressure
The Bikers eyes roll up in their sockets
Severen whispers in his ear

SEVEREN
Know what I said to your mother I
said shhhhhh honey this wont
hurt

The Savage One buries his teeth in the mans neck

SEVEREN
I said

Severen uses his teeth

The bar becomes sickeningly still

The Savage Ones face flushes and his sinewy body shudders and
shivers as the dying Biker spasmodically quivers

Severens neck contracts as he GULPS and GULPS

With a high wild cry he heaves the dead limp body of the
Biker onto the jukebox with a CRASH

Revved up he wipes his mouth off with the back of his hand
His eyes afire

Sated

The Trucker bolts for the door

Jesse blocks his way

SNAPPING back the hammer of the Peacemaker

The Trucker doesnt move a muscle

The Bartender is white in the face

BARTENDER
What do you people want

JESSE
Just a couple more minutes of your
time

Caleb watches the whole scene with his mouth open

JESSE
-Bout the same duration as the rest
of your life

The farmboy starts walking away from the bar stuperuous

He doesnt see the Bartender reach under the counter behind him
Picking up a double-barreled sawed-off 12 gauge shotgun
Vaulting the bar landing on both feet raising the weapon to
his eye

The boy hears him and whirls
The Bartender gives him both barrels square in the chest
Blowing a ragged rupture through his back and ripping a hole out
of his chest

Caleb blinks

Smoke rises

The boy looks down at his ravaged torso

CALEB
Oh shit

Hes still standing

Hes still alive

Utterly unhurt

Severen walks over

The Bartender is scared spitless frantically trying to reload
The Savage One claps his hand on the boys shoulder

Calebs mouth tries to form words

SEVEREN
This is a kick aint it Go sit
down Ill finish this up

Caleb dazedly has a seat on a barstool
The Bartender is almost sobbing as he wrestles with his gun
Severen wriggles his fingers at him

SEVEREN
Yoo-hoo

The Bartender looks up

Severen leaps into the air lashing out with his boot

His razor sharp roweled spur slashing across the mans throat
Laying it open

The Bartender stumbles back still on his feet

Raising his shotgun

The Savage One kicks out with his other boot

Slashing the mans throat a second time

The barman sways on his feet

The shotgun dropping from his grasp

With a rebel yell Severen jumps into the air

Hitting the Bartender smack between the eyes with both boots
Knocking the nearly severed head off his shoulders

The headless body sinks to the floor

The Savage One wipes his hands on his pants

Sings off key

SEVEREN
Maaammma dont let your babies grow
up to be cowboys Dont let them
strum guitars and drive them old
trucks let them be doctors and
lawyers and such

Caleb just sits on the barstool fingering the ragged shotgun
blast in his chest

The Trucker stands by the booth

Not looking very big now

Fear terrible in his eyes

Diamondback almost compassionate

She speaks softly sitting in the booth

DIAMONDBACK
Theres a fly on the ceiling

The Trucker looks up

Homer empties his 38 into the man

Who falls on the floor

The Pale One grabs a handful of his hair and yanks his head
back

Exposing the throat

She produces her knife

Flash of steel

Caleb winces as he meets Maes eyes

She gets up out of the booth

Walks up to the last remaining survivor

The Cowboy Teenager

Wetting himself as he holds onto the pool cue for dear life
She puts her eyes on Caleb

The girl takes one of the Cowboys Teenagers hands in her own

She puts his other hand on her waist

Melds her eyes gently into his

Severen KICKS the jukebox

A ROMANTIC COUNTRY MELODY comes out of the old glowing
Wurlitzer

The kid is so scared he is in a state of shock

She whispers to him softly

MAE
Please dance with me

She leads him in a simple shuffling slow dance
Winding her hands down his back

Tenderly

The side of her face by the side of his

She turns him so that she can see Caleb over his shoulder
The farmboy looks at her

Not liking that she is dancing with the other boy

He stands up off the stool

The COUNTRY MELODY permeating the abattoir of a barroom
The two of them dancing

She fingers the Cowboy Teenagers hair

His eyes are blank

Caleb comes toward them

Behind the boys back

Mae slowly bobs and weaves with the boy on the floor

Her eyes fixed to Caleb over his shoulder
Her lips turn up in a smile

MAE
Hes for you Caleb

The farmboy looks around him to see all the eyes of the others
on him

He looks at Mae

Knows its now or never

He puts his hand on the boys shoulder

The Cowboy Teenager screams his lungs out

He rips free of Mae

Covers his head with his arms

Dives headfirst through the neon Budweiser sign on the window
Caleb jumps out the window after him

MAE
Get him Caleb

The others grab her and get busy

Homer picks up the book of matches and strikes them one by one
chucking them onto the sawdust on the floor

Fires shoot up

Severen and Jesse make Molotov Cocktails out of the bottles on
the bar

Hurling them in combustion explosions of alcohol fire against
the walls

They torch the place and steal out the front doors

EXT ROADHOUSE - NIGHT

The Cowboy Teenager running hell for leather

Caleb on his heels

The big squat barn of a Roadhouse going up in flames
Five silhouettes emerge from the smoking structure

Moving to the black Dodge Camper in the parking lot
Severen hot wiring the vehicle with that smooth practiced
efficiency

The others jumping in

The Camper quickly accelerating to the road

EXT ROAD - NIGHT

Calebs strong limbs flying over the blacktop

The Cowboy stares over his shoulder in terrific fear choking
for breath

Caleb gaining on him

The Camper and the others way way behind

The farmboy reaching out with his hand

Clamping down on the Cowboy Teenagers shoulder

Spinning him about with superlative strength

Baring his teeth
Face to face with one his own age
He sees himself how he once was
Caleb freezes
He cant do it
Suddenly headlights from behind
The Dodge Camper bearing down
The Cowboy Teenager looks up
Through the glass to Jesses grim face
He looks like he wants to cry
Then another pair of lights
This time from the other direction
A small SEMI with a flatbed wheels around the bend in the road
In a burst of speed the Cowboy Teenager breaks for it
The Camper almost on Calebs heels
Braking in a SQUEAL of smoking tires
As the Teenager leaps onto the flatbed barrelling by
Caleb runs fast as he can after the receding Truck
The Dodge Camper starting to make a U-turn
Suddenly blocked by an oncoming rush of Cars
Calebs feet slap the dirt on the side of the road as the Semi
picks up speed and leaves him in its dust
Caleb pulls up
Looking from the disappearing Semi to the Dodge Camper stopped
on the other side of the road
Then back to the Semi
Watching the red taillights of the Truck swallowed up by the
night
Traffic passing him
Then the Camper is abruptly at his side
A door cracks open
Long arms snatch him off the road

INT DODGE CAMPER - PRE-DAWN

Jesse squints into the faint light beginning to pale the edge of
the world

Vicious hands tug Caleb inside

Black looks

The Silvered One twists the Camper around and punches the pedal

JESSE

time boy

The Camper hurtling across the flatlands

SEVEREN
Now Jess

Clicking very sharp teeth
Jesses eyes boring through the windshield
JESSE
Fuckin sun

Mae clings to the farmboy
Homer gives him a sickening face

HOMER
I think we should just leave your
boyfriend out on the road and let him
get hisself a suntan

Diamondback stares out the glass toward the gently paling sky

DIAMONDBACK
We better move our ass

The Silvered One fixes the boys face in the rear-view mirror

JESSE
Boy you screwed us up this time We
got five minutes before sunup and we
aint found us a place to stay

He punches the steering wheel

Smearing his foot to the floor

Horizonline becoming more and more distinct
The road ahead absolutely empty

Caleb stares down into his hands

Mae looks at him with soft eyes

JESSE

aways made this vehicle hes gonna
go straight to the cops and theyre

A deadly silence
That epic face straight front

JESSE
You both fucked us up

Mae closes her eyes

The Dodge Camper streaking down the road

The sun now just ducking below the horizon
A tremor of fear rippling through every face
Blankets being tossed around

Tentacles of light piercing the glass

It looks like it hurts

Mae breathes deep

Lifts a strong face to the front

MAE
You gonna talk Jess or you gonna
get us out of the sun

Jesse looks at her through low lidded eyes

JESSE
-Okay

Soft and sweet

Mae shakes down to her bootstraps

Severen CRACKS his knuckles

Homer WHISTLES

Diamondback gives Mae a soul shaking smile

Then through the glass a Travel Court complex of little
bungalows off to the side of the road

JESSE
Bout time

Lifting his foot off the gas

EXT HIDE-A-WAY TRAVEL COURTS - PRE-DAWN

The Dodge Camper pulls up in front of the registration office
The sun just about to peer over the edge of the world

INT REGISTRATION OFFICE - HIDE-A-WAY TRAVEL COURTS - PRE-DAWN

Jesse bursts into the empty room

He taps a finger on the desktop bell

Nothing

A pale beam of light creeps in through the curtains

He sweats

Finally the white haired MANAGER still in pajamas moves across
the floor with the assistance of a cane

A smooth smile graces Jesses lips

JESSE
Id like to rent one of your
bungalows Sir

The old man presses his hearing aid nudging his head forward

MANAGER
Wha

The Silvered One notices the slow rise of light crawling across
the countertop toward his hand
He lays down a fifty dollar bill
JESSE
The key

A flicker of understanding in the Managers face

Plucking a set of keys off the desk

Jesse grabs the key from him just as the sunlight lands upon the
counter where his hand just was

He turns to go

MANAGER
Hey you were here bfore once
wasnt ya Lotsa years back

The Silvered One gives him a friendly grin as he walks out

EXT COTTAGE - HIDE-A-WAY TRAVEL COURTS - PRE-DAWN

Jesse hurriedly unlocks the door

The six figures hasten in

Slamming the door shut behind him

The reflection of the sliver of sun in the window slicing like a
knife across the sharp side of the planet

EXT HIDE-A-WAY TRAVEL COURTS - DAY

The sun high in the cloudless sky

In the courtyard between the bungalows a DOG barks playfully
And scampers after a stick

He brings it back in his mouth to a bright and bushy tailed
SMALL BOY in sneakers and shorts

An ELDERLY COUPLE rock back and forth on the front porch of one
of the bungalows

A laid-back lazy morning

The Dodge Camper sits behind one of the quiet bungalows

The black paint baking in the hot sun

The little boy hurls the stick

It soars through the air

The pooch scrambles after it

The stick lands

The dog pads after it

A hand picks it up

The dog wags its tail

A POLICE OFFICER with a shotgun under his arm is holding the
stick

Three Patrol Cars creep into the courtyard tires CRUMBLING the
gravel

The Policeman hurls the stick way in the other direction

The dog runs after it out of harms way

The small boy is motioned onto the porch of his Grandparents
cottage

The Elderly Couple rise to their feet holding the small boy to
them

The Police Officer gestures for the three Patrol Cars to follow
him

The Cowboy Teenager is sitting in the backseat of one of the
cars pointing nervously to the Camper and nodding

The Police Officer aims his eyes at the bungalow at the end of
the Travel Courts

The three Patrol Cars mobilize in a fan formation around the

One more PATROL CAR moves into position out back

The doors are flung open

Assault rifles are readied in the arms of SEVEN COPS

Aiming at the walls and windows of the sleeping bungalow
Everything so quiet and calm on this nice summer morning with

The Police Officer walks up to the front door

And KNOCKS

Blackness

Curtains pulled tight

A deathly quiet

Six slumbering bodies

Caleb sprawled out on an overstuffed chair

Mae curled up in his arms

Jesse and Diamondback in the only bed

Severen sleeping standing up leaning against the wall
Through the open bathroom door Homer flat on his back in the
bathtub

A pillow over his face

A hard KNOCK on the front door

Homer throws the pillow from his face

Opens a sleepy lid

A VOICE from behind the door

POLICE OFFICER
This is the police Come out with
your hands up

Severens eyes pop open

Jesse leaps out of bed

Mae raises her head

Homer runs into the room
Diamondback rises to her feet

POLICE OFFICER
(OS)
You are surrounded

All eyes travel to Caleb

Caleb gets up

Worry in his eyes

Severen walks to the window lifts a finger to the curtain and
pulls it back a crack

A single ray of sunlight explodes across his face like a burning
spear

He jumps back

Screaming

Skin smoking

Hands pawing at his face

SEVEREN
FUCKIN DAYTIME

Jesse yanks the Colt Peacemaker out of his belt and cracks the
glass of the window with the butt

Caleb stands head going back and forth as he watches the others
burst into action

Mae produces a small pearl-handled 22 and a box of ammo out of
her jacket

Diamondback has a sawed off twelve gauge in her coat

The Pale One swings up alongside one of the windows smashing
out the glass with the stock

The Savage One plants his eyes on the farmboy as he grabs the
two pieces of a disassembled rifle out of his jacket

He screws on the barrel

Then he yanks a 357 Magnum out of his pocket

Fury scars his face as he holds it by the barrel for Caleb to
take

The farmboy reaches for it

Severen flips the pistol and catches it by the handle

Meaning to use it on the new boy

SEVEREN
Oughta give you this end of it

Jesse shoots him a stern glance

JESSE
Give him the piece Severen

Severen sighs
Hands over the gun
Caleb feels the weight and heft of the pice

Severen steps right in front of the door

The rifle leveled in one hand at his waist

Finger on the trigger

Barrel fixed on the door

He plugs one ear with his finger and winks at the rest

He BLASTS a round through the door

The Policeman standing in front of the door takes the heavy
calibre round square in the chest

It blows him clear off his feet

A shaft of sunlight shoots through the bullet hole in the door

INT COTTAGE - HIDE-A-WAY TRAVEL COURTS - DAY

The shaft of sunshine streams through the door

Striking Severen smack between the shoulder blades

He is flung back against the wall and slides to the floor
His shirt smoking

The others open FIRE out the windows

EXT COTTAGE - HIDE-A-WAY TRAVEL COURTS - DAY

The Seven Police Officers let loose with their assault rifles
Ravaging the walls and shattered windows with SHOTS
The air split by a DEAFENING DIN of gunfire

INT COTTAGE - HIDE-A-WAY TRAVEL COURTS - DAY

A RIFLEBLAST rips two holes in the walls by Jesses head as he
reloads

Pinpricks of light blaze across the room

The Silvered One dives out of the way

A mirror on the wall fractures the light

Homer gets hit on the hand by a deflected ray

Skin bursts into flames

He yelps running out of the way

Homer lifts his 38 to the window and starts pumping off ROUNDS
Jesse shoots out the mirror to splintered glass smithereens
Bullet holes swiss cheese the walls and roof

EXPLOSIONS of GUNFIRE rip through the wallpaper

Needles and lances of bright sunlight cats cradle the room
The day comes through the holes and punctures in a maze of tiny
funnels

The six inside desperately keep up their volleys of gunfire
They dodge dive duck and avoid the laser beams of light that
continue to cordon off the areas of the room they can move and
fight back in

Calebs gun isnt loaded and while he is popping in shells a
stray round from outside hits the box and scatters the
cartridges

He glances over while he frantically retrieves the bullets to
see Mae emptying her cute little 22 out the window alongside
Homer

BULLETS RICHOCHET around the room with a piercing WHINE

The farmboy looks up and sees the rear window

The Camper is parked outside it

He thinks fast

A wall starting to splinter open with another round of GUNSHOT
BLASTS

Light burning across the floor

Jesse throws the car keys into Calebs open palm

The farmboy yanks the bedspread off the bed and throws it over
his head

Mae reaches out with her hand touching Calebs arm

BULLETS flying left and right

She looks into his eyes

Caleb meets her gaze

Another EXPLOSION of GUNSHOTS

The farmboy spins on his feet racing for the back window

He leaps through the air and dives through the glass

Caleb lands in a heap in the dirt

The sun attacks him beneath the bedspread

A single Policeman staking out the back starts SHOOTING at the
figure under the blanket

Caleb jumps to his feet and dodges bullets as he hurries for the
Camper with the blanket flowing behind him like a cape

His hands holding the cover beginning to burn as the wicked sun
hits them

He starts to scream

The Camper only a few feet ahead

He claws forward

The Policeman takes careful aim

A bullet glances Caleb in the chest

He keeps moving
Reaching the vehicle as the skin of his hands starts to smoke
Ripping the door open and bursting inside

Caleb kneels down behind the dashboard to shield himself from
the direct sunlight

He grips the steering wheel and slams the keys into the
ignition

The engine FIRES up

He smashes his foot into the gas pedal

The sun blazes through the darkened windshield

He moans as the subdued light hits his face

Blackening the skin on his forehead

He ducks below the dash

Steering the vehicle straight ahead for the wall of the bullet-
riddled bungalow

A tidal wave of deadly white light as the Camper breaks through

Wood and glass raining down

The others wrap themselves in blankets they scrounge off the bed
as the light spreads through the room

The black Camper covered with wallpaper and plaster sitting in
the middle of the floor

Everyone is yelling loudly as they tear towards the vehicle
Slinging their guns in the back compartments they all help each
other in

Caleb hauls Mae into the seat beside him by a tug on her arm
Homer grabs onto the rear bumper crawling up the back for the
open rear window

Screaming his lungs out as the bare sunlight bathes his small
body

BULLETS RICOCHET off the front and sides of the Camper as the
assault continues from outside

One bullet cracks the window into a giant spiderweb

Caleb drives his foot down on the accelerator
The car starts going

The nose of the Camper breaks through the front of the cottage
like a huge black beast

Felling the screen door and powderizing the flower pots in its
path

The Policemen hold their fire for a moment and stare
incredulously

The Dodge Camper lurches forward carrying the frame of the
cottage on its back like a shell

Ramming head on into a Police Car parked directly in front
The Policemen regain their senses getting out of the way of the
Camper

Pivoting and FIRING as they go

A deafening SOUND of SHEARING METAL as the Police Car crumples
beneath the impact of the Camper

As the Camper charges out into the parking lot

Bullets dappling the sides of the vehicle whose solid steel
reinforced bodywork protects those inside like armor

The Camper kicks up thick trails of dust and gravel

Fragments of the building raining off the roof of the vehicle
They hurtle toward the tarmac of the open road

The Policemen jumping into their three remaining vehicles

The Camper streaking out onto the blacktop

The Elderly Couple standing on the front porch exchanging
glances of complete awe

The police cars swerving into single file formation and speeding
out of the area with their cherrytops flaring

The Small Boy wide eyed in wonderment as he walks onto the
driveway and watches them disappear in the settling dust

The Dog trots around with the stick between its teeth tail
wagging excitedly

EXT TWO-LANE HIGHWAY - DUSK

Three patrol cars swoop after their fleeing quarry like birds of
prey

The object of their pursuit driving away from a setting sun

Red cherrytops igniting the livid sky

Two of the cop cars fan out

Windows rolling down

Shotguns aimed out

INT DODGE CAMPER - DUSK

Caleb is pummelled by the daylight piercing through the tinted
glass windows

Blackening his skin in burned splotches

His hands fixed on the steering wheel smoking

His foot hard on the gas pedal

Squinting over the dashboard ducking down against the assault
of the sunshine

A SHOTGUN BLAST blows a spiderweb out of the windshield

The five figures are huddling down under the blankets pulled
over them

The boy struggles to keep the Camper on the road

Another SHOTGUN BLAST splinters the side mirror

Several loose pellets puncture the tinted glass

Needlelike lances of light pricking Calebs skin

CALEB
Somebody do something

EXT TWO-LANE HIGHWAY - DUSK

The Camper charges down the road
The three Police Cars hurtling after it
Dust settles in a streak of red cherry tops

INT DODGE CAMPER - DUSK

The shield of the four walls of the vehicle are being breached
by the shotguns

Laserlike beams of light shoot through the bullet holes
Severen and Jesse poke their heads up out of the blankets
Peering over the backseat

Recoiling from the sunshine singeing their faces

They duck down and grab up rifles

FIRING off round after round through the shattered glass of the
back windshield

EXT POLICE CAR 1 - DUSK

It advances
Shotgun barrel poking out the window

INT DODGE CAMPER - DUSK

Caleb is slammed against the sidedoor as a BLAST of buckshot
taps him on the shoulder

He loses control of the wheel for a second

The vehicle swerves wildly beneath him

He regains command of the Camper

Blood trickling from the hole in his shirt

Using up all his will and strength to keep driving in the
excruciating sunlight
The wound in his shoulder already healing up
The boy holding up as well as he can
Beneath the blankets in the backseat by the floor Mae
Diamondback and Homer huddle for security against the flying
bullets and piercing sunshine spears
Jesse and Severen return the fire out the back windshield

EXT TWO-LANE HIGHWAY - DUSK

The Police Cars are flanked over both the outgoing and oncoming
lanes

Shots going every which way

A hay truck is approaching in the opposing lane barreling down
HONKING its HORN

The patrol cars retract into the outgoing lane resuming a
single file formation behind the Camper

The truck goes on by

INT DODGE CAMPER - DUSK

Severen throws a glance to Caleb in the front seat
Shouting at the top of his lungs over the ROAR of the ENGINES
and the WHINE of the BULLETS

SEVEREN
CALEB IM GONNA GET THOSE COPS
WHATEVER HAPPENS YOU JUST KEEP ON
GOIN GOT THAT

CALEB
YEAH

Diamondback hands the sawed-off shotgun to Severen
The Savage One cracks open the weapon in his hands
Slams in a fistful of shells

Gives an eye to the Silvered One

SEVEREN
Nice knowin ya Jess

With that Severn leaps over the backseat

Kicks open the rear door

Hovers in the wind and white hot sunshine for a fraction of a
second

His hand holding the shotgun is on fire

EXT DODGE CAMPER - DUSK

The Savage One brings up the weapon
Staring at the three Police Cars looking him in the face

The direct sunlight making his skin smoke
BULLETS speeding past his face
Severen jumps off the back transom of the Camper at 90
Vaulting through empty air

EXT POLICE CAR 1 - DUSK

The Savage One lands first on the hood

The POLICEMEN in the front seat stare at him in awe

Severen points the sawed off shotgun in their faces

Firing the first barrel through the windshield

The unmanned patrol car jars violently around the road

The Savage One climbs up on the roof

Using the cherrytop blinkers for leverage he heaves himself
through the air

Leapfrogging from one Police Car to the other

EXT POLICE CAR 2 - DUSK

The cops inside are shocked

Severen lands smack dab on the hood on all fours

The sawed off shotgun in his hands

His face afire

His hair smouldering

His shotgun blazing

Punching twin holes through the windshield

Blowing the men away behind it

The car speeding off the road

Severen scrambling atop the roof before its too late
Plummeting spread-eagled over the open road toward the third
Police Car coming right toward him

INT POLICE CAR 3 - DUSK

The Cowboy Teenager in the backseat ducks down

The POLICEMEN dont react fast enough

Severen EXPLODES through the windshield in clouds of cubed
glass

Breaking the second cops neck as he lands in his lap

The cop behind the wheel grabs for his gun

The Savage One takes it from him and shoots him in the side with
it

Severen shoves him out the door as he slides behind the wheel
Taking over the Police Car

Stepping on the brake

Slowing to a stop in a SCREECH of TIRES

EXT TWO-LANE HIGHWAY - DUSK

The sun sinking below the smouldering horizon
The Camper comes to a halt

The third Police Car stationary in the road several hundred
yards to the rear
The second Police Car flipped over on its side in a field of
wheat
In flames
The field on fire around it
The first Police Car a crumpled heap of metal and glass all over
the two lanes
Sundown
Nighttime

EXT DODGE CAMPER - NIGHT

The door opens tentatively

Caleb climbs out of the bullet-riddled vehicle onto solid
ground

A little unsteady on his feet

Looking every bit the wounded warrior who has returned in one
piece

His skin charred and seared

Injuries that will heal

He lets out a sigh and blinks his eyes

A sort of smile as he sees Jesse Mae Diamondback and little
Homer step out of the rear door and onto the road

They all regard one another with relief

Mae runs to Caleb and they embrace

Jesse claps his hand on the boys shoulder

JESSE
Not too shabby

A CAR DOOR SLAMMING spins their heads around

EXT POLICE CAR 3 - NIGHT

A scorched worse for wear Severen leans against the side of the
car
His hair cindered

His smile a white sickle in his blackened charred features
His eyes wickedly bright

He lights up a cigarette

He makes eye contact with the farmboy

The farmboy starts to smile

Breathing again

The Savage One strides on back to the others standing beside the
Camper

Caleb glances up at the black roof of night

Drowning in that depthless space

Taking some steps off the road into the fields

EXT FIELDS - NIGHT

The farmboy holds the moment

Spying that last sliver of sunlight hovering on the horizon
Like the last sunlight he will see for a long long time

He swallows

Finding some kind of solace

INT POLICE CAR 3 - NIGHT

The rear door opens
The car is empty

EXT DODGE CAMPER - NIGHT

Parked at the side of the lonesome road

Five shadowy silhouettes milling around the front of the
vehicle

All is quiet at the back

Where a pair of hands reach up to the metal container of
gasoline attached to the back

They pry it off noiselessly

Silent feet pad around to the front

Trembling fingers unscrew the cap

Suddenly dousing the five figures with the amber liquid
GASPS all around

The Cowboy Teenager backs quickly and strikes a match
The Savage One swipes at his wet jacket

Jesse whirls a deadly eye on the kid

Diamondback stares at the match lips quivering

Homer gulps

WWWEFFFFFFFFFFITTTT

The match is blown out

The Cowboy spins

But Caleb already has him by the throat with a set of clamping
fingers

Caleb locks his teeth on the Cowboy Teenagers neck

The kids feet kick and thrash in the air

Then they stop kicking

Quit thrashing

Hanging limp

Caleb heaves the drained body of the boy into the bushes
Returns to the others

They pile into the Camper

And go

EXT ROADSIDE - NIGHT

A white STATION WAGON accelerates past the abandoned black Dodge
Camper parked at the side of the road in the middle of nowhere

EXT BORDERLINE OF KANSAS AND NEBRASKA - NIGHT

The white Station Wagon whips past a roadsign saying You are
entering the state of Nebraska
Red taillights shrink

EXT OUTSKIRTS OF GODSPEED NEBRASKA - NIGHT

The moon is big and bright above this one road town

The White Station Wagon cuts past a sign reading Godspeed

Pop 327

One gas station

And one Motel

The white Station Wagon pulls into the parking lot of the Motel

EXT BORDERLINE OF KANSAS AND NEBRASKA - NIGHT

The Chevy Pickup drives past the roadsign
The small figures of Loy and Sarah inside

EXT GODSPEED MOTEL - NIGHT

The Station Wagon comes to rest before the run down Motel
The Godspeed sign in bright white electric neon
Somewhere in the distant black horizon a rooster CROWS

INT ROOM 7 - GODSPEED MOTEL - NIGHT

Jesse closes the door behind him

Severen drops into a chair kicking his feet up on a low table
Diamondback rubs at the blackened smoke along her arms

Homer plops down on the bed

Caleb and Mae sink into a couch

Relief and quiet fall over them

The farmboy feels everybodys eyes on him

In a good way

That isnt good at all

Diamondback leans over and claps her hand on his knee

DIAMONDBACK
Welcome

Mae smiles up at her proudly

Severen reaches to his cowboy boot and rips off one of his
spurs

He looks over to Caleb

A razor blade wink

SEVEREN
Catch
He tosses the spur to Caleb

With the warmest grin Severen has ever worn on his broken face
The farmboy closes his palm over the silver spur

Having to grin

Homer bounces off the bed and comes up to Caleb

He reaches out with his hand

Looks Caleb square in the face

HOMER
Shake

Caleb takes hold of his hand

CALEB
Thanks

Homer smiles up at Caleb with those ageless eyes in his little
boy face

Jesse looks down at the farmboy his silver hair gleaming in the
yellow lamplight

JESSE
Glad to have y with us son

Caleb gazes at him a long moment

CALEB
Jesse theres a question I been
meaning to ask you

JESSE
What might that be

CALEB
How old are ya

The Silvered One stares off remembering

JESSE
Lets put it this way I fought for
the south

CALEB
South

JESSE
We lost

Mae comes to her feet

MAE
Caleb lets go take a look at the
night

He follows her out the door
Diamondback watches them leave with a smile on her face
Homer flicks on the television set
A late night religious program flickers across the screen
Severen pulls a deck of cards out of his jacket and begins
shuffling them
Jesse lights a fresh cigarette taking a seat across from
Severen
The Savage One starts to deal a hand

EXT GODSPEED MOTEL - NIGHT

The silver spur CLICKS softly as Caleb walks beside Mae along
the narrow walkway of the Motel

They veer off the parking lot and head out into the green
pasture behind the building

EXT GRASS PASTURE - GODSPEED MOTEL - NIGHT

A burst of stars
One falls
Mae takes hold of Calebs hand

MAE
Well youre one of us now Caleb

CALEB
What does that make me

MAE
Aint exactly sure

CALEB
But its good right

Pause
A half smile

MAE
Guess so

He looks at her
They walk on

INT ROOM 7 - GODSPEED MOTEL - NIGHT

A poker game going strong between Severen Jesse and
Diamondback

Smoke hanging in the air

Homer glances over his shoulder as he opens the front door

HOMER
Im going to take the air

Diamondback nods as Homer closes the door behind him

EXT GODSPEED MOTEL - NIGHT

Homer whistles happily as he walks the narrow walkway of the
Motel

He hears the soft CLICK of a coin being deposited in the soda
machine up ahead

He lifts his eyes

EXT SODA MACHINE - GODSPEED MOTEL - NIGHT

Sarah Colton is dressed in her grey flannel pajamas

She gazes at the soda machine trying to decide which one to
have

The cold flourescent light bathes her small heart shaped face
Her golden hair touseled around her face from sleep

She hits the Orange Crush button

The dull THUD of a can hitting the deck

She lifts it out

Pops it open

Turns her face to the small boy staring at her several feet
away

She furrows her brow

SARAH
Its impolite to stare

Homers face cracks open in a wide smile as he takes a step
toward her

HOMER
Howdy

He begins to tremble as he walks

Sarah POPS the top of the Orange Crush can
Gulps down some of the cool liquid

It spills onto her chin

She swipes at it with the back of her hand
The boy comes to a stop in front of her
She looks at him curiously

The ragged striped t-shirt

Faded blue jeans

High top sneakers

Kind of cute dust smile

He gazes at her all dewy eyed

HOMER
My names Homer Whats yours
SARAH

Sarah

HOMER
What are you doin down here all by
yourself

SARAH
I do what I want to when I want to do
it

She turns and starts for the stairs
His eyes follow her

HOMER
You want to watch TV

She stops
Thinks it over

EXT GRASS PASTURE - GODSPEED MOTEL - NIGHT

Heat lightning in a sky like some enchanted landscape
Caleb and Mae very small beneath as they walk hand and hand

CALEB
The day you miss it

MAE
Im beginning to forget what it was
like You

CALEB
I can see better at night

They stop
Embrace

INT ROOM 7 - GODSPEED MOTEL - NIGHT

Homer smiles from ear to ear as he enters the room
A blonde haired little girl beside him
Looking like an angel in her healthy mortal glow

HOMER
Id like to introduce yall to Sarah

Sarah gazes up curiously into the faces of Jesse Severen and
Diamondback as they put down their cards

SARAH
Boy you people sure stay up late
Severen grins slyly

SEVEREN
We keep odd hours

Homer shows Sarah to a chair by the television

His face beaming with True Love and Devotion

He looks pretty silly

The others roll their eyes

The television is playing the station signoff

The NATIONAL ANTHEM reverberates around the room in a bugle
refrain

Sarah has plunked herself down in front of the TV and notices
nothing else

She giggles

Homer flashes her a look of pure love

Behind Sarahs back Severen catches the Little Ones eye with a
wink

The Savage One slips his hand under his shirt and feigns a
pumping heart

Homer blushes

Jesse leans back in his seat watching the girl puffing on his
cigarette smiling

Diamondback casts a bemused but worried eye on Homer

DIAMONDBACK
Homer sweet darlin Homer you
look at me when Im talkin to you
now

HOMER
What

His voice is sharp almost dangerous
Diamondbacks mind is working beneath her good ol gal manners

DIAMONDBACK
Sarah you here with your family

The little girl tears her eyes away from the TV and the last
moments of the station signoff

SARAH
Just my daddy

Jesses gaze brushes over her small face

DIAMONDBACK
What room you stayin in honey

Sarah thinks for a second

SARAH
Un number three

She goes back to the television

Jesse gives a look to Severen

The Savage One rises to his feet laying his cards face down on
the table

And slips out the door

The television screen turns to blank fuzz

Homer spins the knob on the television

HOMER
Therell be somethin on another
channel

Only fuzz
Sarah shakes her head rising to her feet

SARAH
I better be going anyhow

She takes a step toward the door
Homer jumps to his feet

HOMER
Sarah wait

Sarah is at the door when it opens and someone walks in
Almost bumping the little girl in the chest

She looks up

Her eyes widen

Her breath sticks in her throat

Her gaze lifting to her big brothers astonished face
Mae just behind him

Looking past his shoulder to the little girl in front
Caleb sinks to one knee in front of Sarah

Stroking his hands across her face and hair as if to reassure
she is right there before him

She stares up in his eyes

Tears

Speechless

The rest of the room stone cold

CALEB
Sarah

The little girls lip quivers

SARAH
I oughta punch your lights out
CALEB
Guess you oughta

SARAH
Oh

She throws her arms around him sobbing happily

The farmboy clutches her to his chest with all hes worth

His lips form words

With a smile that passes from the world of the dead to the land
of the living

It takes a moment before he acknowledges all the strange looks
he is receiving

CALEB
Shes my sister people

Activity outside the door

LOY (VO)
So thats where she went to Gota

mind of her own that little girl of
mine Ill get her out of your hair

Caleb spins around at the sound of his fathers voice
Looking into the face of Loy Colton standing in the doorway
face puffy from sleep

Severen hovering behind the man like the sickle of his namesake

Father and son make some serious eye contact
Words just dont express the feelings

CALEB
Hello

LOY
Been looking for you

CALEB
Tried callin you

LOY
We been out a lot Drivin in the
truck Tryin to track you down

CALEB
Dad

LOY
Son

Severen shuts the door
Shaking his head with a savagely sardonic smile

SEVEREN
Round and round and round she goes
and where she stops nobody knows

He throws the latch
Locking the latch
Jesse pulling the window blinds

SEVEREN
--But its ‘bout time for that ‘ol
wheel to stop rotatin

Loy swiftly moves over to Sarah and retrieves his daughter in
his arms

LOY
Who are these people

Caleb notices the others assuming attack formation against the
walls

He positions himself to Loy and Sarahs maximum advantage
between them

Acting as a buffer

He looks his father in the face

CALEB
Im with them now

The farmboy shoots a knifeblade glance to the others standing
around with a certain redress in their eyes

CALEB
Let them go

He returns his gaze to his father and sister

CALEB
Go

LOY
You comin

Caleb watches Maes glance

She wants him

Shes in him

He wont be without her

She touches him on the sleeve and thats all she wrote
Sarah watches this other woman closely

Caleb turns to his family

Shakes his had softly

Eyes firm

CALEB
No But youre going’

The farmboy feels tension in the air like a trip wire on a time
bomb

He takes his father carefully by the hand

Moving him slowly step by step toward the door

Severen is standing in front of it with his arms crossed

Caleb looks him in the eye

The Savage One looks him back

The farmboy puts his hand on the doorknob

Turns it

HOMER

The Little One jumps off the bed like a trampoline
Snatching Sarah in his arms

Stealing her away

The small girl kicking and screaming

Desperate satisfaction in Homers face

HOMER
Mine

Caleb takes a step toward him

His hands out

Knowing full well the unstable little bag of bones necklocking
his tiny sister could snap her spine like a twig

Caleb speaks softly

CALEB
Gonna have to give her back now

HOMER
Im gonna nip her

CALEB
Cant do that Not to her

Homer begins to nuzzle her neck

The Little One looks up at the farmboy with dead calm in his
eyes

A smile widens slowly along his mouth

HOMER
I turned Mae She went off an
turned you Now Im turnin’ your
little sister That makes us even
steven

Calebs face turns black
His knuckles whiten

CALEB
Homer you give her back or Im going
to hurt your body

Severen subdues Caleb in an armlock
As confining as a steel vest

SEVEREN
Now you just settle down there
cowboy ‘Member which side of your

bread the butters on

CALEB
GODDAMMIT ALL OF YOU THEYRE MY
FAMILY AND YOURE GONNA HAFTA LET EM
GO NOW

Jesses face has a sad gait to it as he steps forward

JESSE
Question is whether theyd let us go
They tracked us this far Now they
know our faces Doesnt look like
theyd leave off after following us
all the way here

The Silvered One puts a firm hand on Calebs sweaty shoulder

JESSE
I say kill ‘em

Diamondback taps the toe of a white cowboy boot on the floor
Looks straight into Calebs face

DIAMONDBACK
Quick

The farmboys pupils dilate

Sarah starts to scream but Homer puts his hand over her mouth
Loy abruptly reaches into his jacket pulling out a 38

He backs off to a strategic corner of the room

Aiming the pistol in a two hand grip at the others

LOY
Thatll be just about enough of this
shit Let go of my boy Let go of
my little girl Now yall jus get
away from the door
He COCKS back the HAMMER of the GUN with his thumb

LOY
---And well be on our way

Caleb speaks through clenched teeth
Severen holding firm

CALEB
Put that away Dad Wont do any
good

JESSE

Listen to your son

The Silvered One comes forward his boots squeaking along the
carpet

The father trains the handgun square between his shoulder
blades

Chuckles
LOY
Whadya mean it wont do any good
Id stop where yare if I was you
Mister
JESSE
Not likely
Loy FIRES

Reaming a hole in the middle of Jesses chest

The Silvered One coughs

Spitting the used bullet into the palm of his hand
Reaching out and putting it in the pocket of Loys shirt
Patting the pocket for safe keeping

His other hand closing on the normal mans hand on the gun
Jesse squeezes

Loy screams in agony

The bones in his hand beginning to snap against the metal of the
gun in the crushing grip of the hand clamped around it
Caleb screams

CALEB
GODDAMITT JESSE

Sarah shrieks

Rage funneling her strength

She whirls around on Homer drawing her hand back into a fist
and connecting with the little boys jaw

Hard

Reeling Homer

Sarah tears free

Bolts for the door
Grips the knob in both her teensy hands and turns
Flinging the door wide open
Her small figure is backlit in an explosion of sunshine
New morning sun flooding into the room
Rimming Sarah like a halo
The shaft of white light burning hot across the floor
Hitting those inside like an atomic blast
Severen closet to the door is blown off his feet
Jesses grip loosens around Loys hand the skin on his grasping
hand smoking as he lets out a loud groan
The father spins around in surprise and alarm at the scene
around him
Nursing his numb hand
Jesse and Diamondback scramble for cover behind the bed
Homer just standing in the sunlight tears pouring out of his
eyes as his face burns
The Silvered One grabs him and throws him down on the carpet
Caleb covers Mae with his body
Ripping the blankets off the bed
Keeping her shielded
Loy stands shell-shocked unable to believe his eyes
Sarah revolves slowly her eyes gradually widening
The bright day framing her in silhouette
Her shadow rising up the wall of the room
She puts her hand on her mouth

SARAH
Daddy did I do that

Caleb wrenches a blanket off the bed
Covers himself with it
He grabs his father and sister in his arms

CALEB
CMON LETS GET TO THE CAR

He shephards them to the door

Looking over his shoulder just once

Mae ducking behind the bed

Twisting her hear around

Her tear-soaked eyes shooting into Calebs face

He almost stays

Severen takes a leap for them into the direct sunlight
He reaches out with his long arms

Fingertips tearing the blanket as the flesh burns

The farmboy ducking out the door with his own

A fist of sunlight punching the Savage One in the face
Knocking him to his knees

He slams the door shut

Soothing darkness sweet relief

EXT PARKING LOT - GODSPEED MOTEL - DAY

Loy and Sarah hustle Calebs blanketed body to the Chevy Pickup
Pulling open the darkened rear compartment
The farmboy clambers in amongst all the veterinary equipment

CALEB
Go Dad

Loy and Sarah jump into the Pickup and tear off outa there

INT REAR COMPARTMENT - CHEVY PICKUP - DAY

The farmboy stretches himself in the shadows among the medical
supplies

A little window to the front seat by his head

He ducks down below it to avoid the shaft of sunlight streaming
through

The vehicle bucks like a bronc

CALEB

Foot flat on the pedal

EXT GODSPEED COUNTY LINE - DAY

The Chevy Pickup RIPROARS in a cloud of dust
Dust settling on the county line of the tiny Nebraska town

Sweating is not the word
CALEB

CALEB

LOY
Bullshit you aint

CALEB
Hospitals fix this

The farmboy sticks his hand up in front of the window by his
fathers face

A thin clear shaft of sunlight across the skin

Skin beginning to smoke

Loy recoils in shock

Caleb pulls his hand down and nurses it

They drive on in silence

The farmboys eyes fall on the rubber tubing glass beakers
shelves of medicines instruments and other medical equipment
stored in the compartment
He fiddles with the apparatus
His mind working

CALEB
Dad you ever transfuse a person

EXT ACCELERATION RAMP ONTO FREEWAY SOUTH - DAY

The Chevy Pickup SCREECHES its TIRES up the ramp
Heading due south
The sun high in a milk white sky

EXT COLTON FARM - DUSK

The sun like a red balloon resting on the edge of the sky
Sinking behind the old homestead cozy and familiar in the lazy
farmlands

The Chevy Pickup is a chute of dust funneling up the driveway
Coming to a full-brake stop in front of the farmhouse

INT VETERINARIAN OPERATING ROOM - COLTON FARM - NIGHT

The windows are curtained and shuttered

Caleb is stretched out on the operating table his skin
abnormally pale and translucent under the lights

Loy standing by him in his shirtsleeves

Metal stands by the operating table with bottles attached to
them

Long perilous needles on rubber tubes fitted to the bottles
The father lifts a hypodermic syringe and fills it with a heavy
tranquilizer

Loy looks real worried as he poises the hypo

LOY
I dont like doing this I dont
really know whats going on You
might not come out of this

CALEB
I wouldnt want to stay like this

Loy takes a deep breath

He uses the hypo

Caleb is knocked out

The father takes a seat pulling a metal stand to his side
Pumps up the veins on his right arm

And inserts the needle

Draining the blood into a bottle

His eyes begin to dim

Just before he loses consciousness he stops
Looking down at the bottle of blood on the floor
Loy lowers his head to his hands
Trying to get the blood back into it
The room beginning to spin
He breathes deep
And gets to work

EXT COLTON FARM —- NIGHT

A moon a day shy of being full casts a bright lunar glow over
the farmlands

The farmhouse sits

Everything still and quiet

Maybe too quiet

INT VETERINARIAN OPERATING ROOM - COLTON FARM - NIGHT

Caleb lies motionless

His right arm injected with a needle and tube which is running
his blood out into a bottle on the floor

Bad blood

His left arm also injected with a needle and tube being fed from
a bottle of his fathers blood hung on a stand

Loy feels for his sons pulse

His own body in a state of complete collapse

There is a dull beating

It is enough to blur Loys eyes with tears

The bottle drains

He gently removes the needles from his sons arms

He slaps the side of Calebs face

No reaction

He shakes the boys shoulders

Nothing

He hangs his head in a moment of exasperation

EXT COLTON FARM —- NIGHT

The moon lowering in the sky
Far away a star twinkles
Maybe a star

INT VETERINARIAN OPERATING ROOM - COLTON FARM - NIGHT

Loy is stroking his boys head with a wet cloth
His own body severely weakened from loss of blood
He slumps in a chair

Trying to fight the urge to sleep

Sheer will keeping him awake

He stares down at his boy

And prays

He tries one last time to wake his son

Lifting him on his chest
Calebs head lolls to one side
Loy starts to weep
His hands trembling
The kitchen door cracks open
Two small eyes peer up
Loy snaps his eyes to the door
Sarah starts to cry

SARAH
Daddy

Loy lets his son back down on the table

A rage reddening his features

He turns his back on the boy

Sarah rushes to his side

Winding two arms around his leg

Sobbing

Loy scoops his daughter up in his arms

Walks toward the back door

And throws is open

Taking a big gulp of the new morning air as a bolt of sunshine
falls in a clean stripe across the floor

Hitting Caleb on the face

He moans

Loy and Sarah turn

Their faces widen

The farmboy clutches his face with his hands

The sun hot on his skin

Then something happens

Nothing

His skin isnt burning

There is no smoke

He slowly draws his hands away looking at them unhurt in the
light of day

Slowly sitting up

Staring into the daytime sky

Blinking

Hardly believing

Hes come home

From the warmth seeping through his haggard features hes been
away a long time

His sister runs to his side

Eyes wandering up to his

His hand strokes her hair

The two of them in the rising flood of sunshine

Tears in his eyes

Loy walks over

Putting his hand on his sons shoulder

Smiling

Spent wrung-out but wearing a shiteating grin on his face

He pulls his son to him
They share a hug
Sunlight streaming in as it rises about the horizon out the open
door

EXT COLTON FARM —- DAY

Dawns early light

The ROOSTERS CROW carries across the lands like a bugle blown
The farm awakening

Skies clearing

The screen door of the house CREAKS open

Caleb walks out into the wide open world

Unsure at first

Squinting into the sunshine

The very real daylight hitting his face

Like hes never seen it before

Its becoming more familiar by the moment

The smell of grass and straw in the air

The bright blue sky

He embraces it all with his eyes

The world that he grew up in returning to give him strength
That strength washing over him

The world so simple and clean

And his again

He takes off his shirt as if meeting the daylight head on

He winds his arm around his little sister

She regards the unsinged healing skin on his bare chest and
arms

She worriedly runs her small fingers on the barely discernable
white marks of the healed shotgun wound scar tissue

The farmboy looks down and sees the apprehension on the girls
face

CALEB
Im okay Sarah I11 tell you what
happened one day Just promise me
you wont ask till then

SARAH
Kay

CALEB
Lets go ride a horse

He throws her atop his shoulders
She giggles and kicks up her feet
He smiles in the bathing sunshine

EXT FIELDS - DAY

The sun is low

The horse gnawing at the grass in the wide open field

Caleb and Sarah lie in one anothers arms fast asleep on the
ground

Unaware of the time

The farmboys eyes drowsily open

Focusing blurrily on the ghost of a moon visible in the blue day
sky

Suddenly he sits up with a start

A shiver running through him as he sees the sun is well on its
way down

Day has become his friend now

Night worse than his worst enemy

Bringing more than mere darkness with it

Night still a few hours off

But the horizon is darkening

Caleb squints in the distance

There seems to be some sort of shadow on the horizonline

The farmboy blinks and it is gone

He picks up his little sister

Frightened he wakes her up and places her on the back of the
horse

SARAH
Whats wrong Caleb

CALEB
Its getting dark we gotta get home

SARAH
Why

CALEB
We just do

Caleb quickly heaves onto the horse

Digging his heels into its flanks

He and Sarah riding like wind toward the farm way way away
The roof of the world losing its light

EXT COLTON FARM - DUSK

Dusk drops like stone

The two stick figures on horseback gallop into the pen
They dismount and get indoors fast as their feet will carry
them

INT KITCHEN - FARMHOUSE - DUSK

Loy is standing by the stove

Dinner cooking

The smells seeming to rejuvinate him although his appearance
remains weakened and worn down

The screen door SLAMS

Caleb and Sarah enter the room

Loy smiles at the boy

LOY
Why dont you set the table Caleb

Caleb smiles at the reassuring old ritual

He opens the cupboard

His eyes slip to the window as he takes the dishes down
The light of day dying fast

Loy catches his sons gaze

Sees the apprehension

Caleb is still

Day blackening

LOY
Caleb

The farmboy shifts his eyes to his father
Erasing the memory
Thought being blocked out

CALEB
Cooling off some huh Almost feel
the fall comin on

A tension moves between father and son

LOY
Days are getting shorter

Caleb looks his father in the face

CALEB
Nights are getting longer

He looks past Loy back to the window and the coming darkness
A shiver runs through him

EXT COLTON FARM - NIGHT
The farm sits quietly on the lone flat land

The last light of day winks on the horizon
Then is gone

INT KITCHEN - COLTON FARM - NIGHT

They all eat in silence

An exchange of looks

Caleb eating very slowly

Sarah draining a glass of milk with a straw
Then blowing bubbles

Loy and Caleb look over

She smiles up at them mischievously

A breeze blows through the kitchen window
The curtains flutter

Sarah yawns

SARAH
Im tired

Her dinner almost completely devoured
Loy looks over at his daughter with tired eyes

LOY
Put your dishes in the sink Ill be
up to read to you in a minute

Sarah gathers up her plate in a small fist

SARAH
I want Caleb to read to me

CALEB
Ill be up in a minute

The little girls face brightens
She dumps her dish in the sink with a loud CLATTER

LOY
Dont forget to brush your teeth

Sarah groans audibly taking the stairs two at a time
A stronger wind blows through the window

Calebs eyes skate to the open windowframe

he rises to his feet

Crosses to the window and reaches out to close it
Something catches his ear

A faint SQUEAKING SOUND

The swing on the porch

He turns an eye to his father

His father notices the anxiety on his sons face
The farmboy tries to hide it

CALEB
Oughta oil that swing

LOY
Ill wait

CALEB
Could use the air

Loy nods

Shrugs

Drains his glass of milk

As Caleb walks out of the room

EXT PORCH - COLTON FARM - NIGHT

Caleb cracks open the front door

A slash of yellow light pours onto the wooden boards of the
porch

He swings open the screen door

The swing rocking back and forth on the rafters
The girl sitting on it

Waiting for him

Maes eyes like a clear sunny summer sky

The farmboy stands there

Listening to his heart beat

His face opens in a smile

Her voice like a bell

MAE
Hi Caleb

Calebs soft brown eyes float over the girls face
She rises to her feet

The swing becomes silent

A cool breeze blows through the porch
Mae starts to walk to Caleb

The farmboy stiffens

His blood starts to pump in his veins
Hot

He quivers at the sight of her

She advances

Caleb takes a step back

Mae stops

MAE
Caleb Whats wrong

He cant take his eyes off her

Something shatters across the farmboys face
His eyes becoming wet

He grits his teeth

Coming forward like a rush of air

Gathering the girl tight in his arms

She winds her hands around his neck
They hold onto one another as if for lifes breath
Reunited

They stare into each others eyes

Her hand touches his

She pulls her arm back like she was stung
Wrestling away from him

Her eyes stabbing into his face

MAE
Your skin its warm

She glances down at her hands that just withdrew from the touch
Caleb swallows

Takes a step toward the girl

Its her turn to back

Down the steps of the porch

Onto the dirt driveway

Her eyes blank fixed on him

Caleb remains on the edge of the porch

Night long and black all around them

CALEB
I belong here I miss you
Maes eyes are ice
MAE

Whats it going to be Caleb

Caleb starts to speak

Then stops

The wind picks up force

Mae takes one last look at him
She spins on her heels

And moves off into the night

A ferocity carrying her limbs out of sight
Caleb lifts his head to the sky
Pinching his eyes closed
Opening his mouth

And screaming her name

CALEB
MAE

To deaf ears

Eyes straining into the blackness

The girl is long gone

On the empty fields only the CHANTING WHIRR of insects
Caleb turns back to the house and walks with heavy steps
He rips open the screen door

And goes inside

INT LIVING ROOM - FARMHOUSE - NIGHT

Loy is nursing a cup of coffee on the couch and reading the
paper

A radio plays softly on the counter

He lifts his head to his son with a gentle smile

Sees the anguish in Calebs eyes

LOY
Caleb

Caleb crosses to him and puts his hand affectionately on his old
mans tired shoulder
Torn in two but keeping it inside

CALEB
How you feelin Dad

LOY
Nothin a day or twos takin it easy
wont remedy How you doin

CALEB
Im going to bed

Loy starts to ask
Then lets it go
Caleb heads for the stairs

LOY
Get a good nights sleep son You
could use it

The farmboy stops at the stairs
Looks over his shoulder with a lengthening smile

CALEB
Its good to be home

The father smiles firm

LOY
Good to have you home

Caleb goes up the stairs
INT HALLWAY - FARMHOUSE - NIGHT
Caleb pauses in front of Sarahs door and gives a small knock

CALEB
Sarah you ready for bed
No answer

CALEB
Sarah

Silence

Caleb tightens

Slamming his palm flat against the door and shoving it open
A cool breeze hits him in the face like a fist

The window wide open

Curtains blowing wildly

In the empty room

CALEB
SARAH

Calebs eyes race to the window and beyond

The town of Fix Oklahoma glittering in the distance
And then

one by one

the lights of the town

begin to go off

A last one winks

And goes out

The wind comes in through the open window
Something mythic on the wings of the wind
Caleb Colton stands by the window staring out
His hair and clothes blown about

His eyes riveted on the black shadow of the town of Fix against

the night skies

Those who have taken his sister are there
He knows he must face them

His eyes hard

His face firming in resolve

EXT FARMHOUSE - COLTON FARM - NIGHT

Caleb runs from the Ford Pickup to the Chevy

All tires have been slashed

The farmboy punches the side of the vehicle

Taking off for the animal pens as fast as his feet will carry
him

EXT HORSE PEN - COLTON FARM - NIGHT

Caleb flings the saddle atop Diesel

Quickly buckling up the cinch

Putting the bridle over the horses head

Grabbing a fistful of reins and hurling himself onto the
animals back

As if sensing the urgency Diesel takes off like a shot into the

night

INT LIVING ROOM - FARMHOUSE - NIGHT

Loy is sound asleep on the couch
Out the window the black horse and its rider disappear into the
night

EXT ROAD - NIGHT

Caleb gallops on the soft shoulder running beside the two-lane
blacktop

The darkened town of Fix lying in wait in the distance
Diesels hooves pound the dirt

A gigantic full moon spotlights the town of Fix

In a dead black swirl of sky

The stars have been blown out

The luminescence glints off Calebs iron eyes as he THUNDERS
down the road on the back of his steed

EXT FIX - NIGHT

A lone figure of the boy on horseback slows to a trot
Going past the sign of the town line

Caleb gives a flick on the reins

The horse walks down the street

Past the closed down burger joint

Diesels shadow passes across the silent and still Tasty Freeze
Trotting on

Caleb alert and aware riding loose limbed coiled for action
Eyes moving left and right

Seeing nothing

The hooves on the asphalt

The animal snorting

Silence so strong you could read by it

The whole little town deathly deserted

Like the boy is the last person in the world

Gathering the reins as he passes the Mini-Market and the
Sheriffs station

All closed

Caleb thinks he hears something

The horse shies

A blur of action

The animal rears

Severen Van Sickle connects a steamshovel roundhouse punch to
the side of the animals head

The horse is knocked cold

It collapses in a heap

Hurling the farmboy head over heels onto the hard blacktop
The Savage One hikes across the asphalt

A single SPUR JINGLING

Wearing a big old grin

Caleb is now human and the fall hurt

It takes him a while to get to his hands and knees
When he looks up theres Severen standing over him
Holding out his hand real friendly like

SEVEREN
Your horse fell down

CALEB
Wheres my little sister Severen

SEVEREN
Lemme give you a hand ol buddy

Severen grabs Calebs hand and gives him a pull

Full strength

Hurling him over his shoulder twenty feet through the air
Caleb comes down with a loud noise on the pavement

His single SPUR grinds against the tarmac in a shower of sparks

The wind really knocked out of him
Severen smiles

Spitting on his fingers

Pointing one of them

SEVEREN
You got one of two choices you come
back with us or you dont come back

Caleb sees the rangy sinewy cowboy coming at him

A laconic stride down the deserted strip of road

His SPUR RINGING through the shut down town

The farmboy hears an ENGINE THUNDER in the other direction in
the distance

Big big headlights

A KENWORTH EIGHTEEN WHEELER tractor trailer rig is coming down
Main Street on its way to the highway

Caleb jumps to his feet and tears off for the vehicle
Standing directly in its onrushing path

It HONKS its HORN

Caleb flags his arms

The gigantic truck BRAKES to a halt in a HISS of AIR and
GRINDING GEARS

The farmboy clambers up on the passenger side

INT CAB - KENWORTH EIGHTEEN WHEELER - NIGHT

Caleb throws open the door and climbs anxiously in
He is sitting beside a big built for diesel REDNECK TRUCKER
Giving the boy one heck of a serious look

REDNECK TRUCKER
Git the fuck outa my truck

CALEB
Get going before we get killed
Believe me

REDNECK TRUCKER
Gonna give you to the count of five
One Two Four

CALEB
Sorry ‘bout this

The farmboy hits the redneck trucker in the face

Knocking him cold

He throws open the drivers door and pushes him out of the cab
Edging over behind the wheel

Wide eyed at the mind-boggling array of gears and controls

CALEB
Im not going to be able to drive
this truck

Caleb looks out the windshield

Severen is approaching the front end of the truck

Bright as a beacon in the headlight beams

His expression calm and incredibly cold

Like if he gets his hands on the truck hell turn it upside
down

Caleb does a fast study of the trucks control panel

CALEB
Im going to be able to drive this
truck

He puts one hand on the steering wheel

Throws the shift

He steps on the gas

The ENGINE SURGES

The truck lurches forward

Lunging like a fifteen foot high eighteen-wheeler behemoth

EXT KENWORTH EIGHTEEN WHEELER —- NIGHT

Severen tries to duck out of the way

The titanic front grill and bumper bash into him
Knocking him off balance

Twenty tons of truck draggin him under the wheels

INT CAB - KENWORTH EIGHTEEN WHEELER - NIGHT

Caleb grits his teeth
Taking his foot off the gas

Scared spitless behind the gigantic machine he is trying to
restrain like breaking a wild mustang
It tools treacherously and powerfully down the darkened road
through town
His eyes level through the windshield at the hood of the truck
The ENGINE RAGING in the night
Severens head abruptly sticks up over the hood
Half of his face raked with tire tread marks
One of his steel sinewed hands comes smashing onto the hood with
such force his fingers put holes in it
Caleb gasps
Trying to maintain his control on the steering wheel
Severen singlehandedly rips the hood off
Exposing the titanic 12 cylinder motor
The Savage One begins to shear off pieces of the engine
Showers of sparks
Spewing gas
Electrical shorts
Severen puts his fist through the motorworks
Ripping out a handful of gears and cylinders amid geysers of oil
spraying the windshield
The ENGINE HOWLS and SHRIEKS
The Eighteen Wheeler is giving up the ghost
Caleb sees the truck is about to stall
Severen is halfway onto the hood and is attempting to bust his
fist through the windshield
The farmboy knows he is about out of time
His hand goes to the twin brakes for the cab and trailer
His eyes harden
His other hand opens the drivers door

CALEB
-Jackknife

Colton throws the brake for the cab
SCREAM of STEEL on STEEL

The cab jarring

Caleb leaps out the door

EXT KENWORTH EIGHTEEN WHEELER —- NIGHT

The farmboy goes jumping out onto the roadbed

Rolling head over heels a few times

Then he looks up

And sees it

Severen clinging to the cab as it skids to a complete stop
The trailer it is carrying continues to travel at 40 MPH
Colliding with the cab

Crumpling it like an accordian

The air TORN with the EAR-SPLITTING COLLISION

The truck crushes like a tin can

EXPLODES into a million pieces

Spreading the remains of Severen Van Sickle across half the
state
Caleb rises to his feet
The rowel of the Savage Ones silver spur flips in the air end
over end dropping down on the tarmac spinning on the ground
like a nickel
Caleb flips it like a coin and sticks it in his back pocket
His awed face framed with flames

EXT ROAD - NIGHT

The fires burn down

Smoke fanned and thinned by passing WINDS

Caleb raises his head

Looks out beyond the smouldering wreckage

Through the smoke

Down the darkened street silhouetted by a pair of headlights of
an idling station wagon stand Jesse Diamondback and Mae
They are standing side by side and facing the straw haired
farmboy

Caleb takes a deep breath closing his fists at his sides
Jesses eyes blacken as they land on Calebs face

A rage passes behind his eyes

JESSE
You fucked us up again

Calebs voice vibrates off the buildings

CALEB
WHERES MY SISTER JESS

Jesses lips curl in a sneer

JESSE
Im gonna hafta kill ya a few times

Caleb stares at the row of faces
Moving from Jesse to Diamondback

DIAMONDBACK
Your sister for Severen

CALEB
MY SISTERS GOT NOTHING TO DO WITH
THIS ITS BETWEEN US LET HER

Go
He turns a desperate eye on Mae

CALEB
MAE

Mae whirls on Jesse with a fierceness in her eyes

MAE
Jesse let him come back

The silvered hair ripples with a slight toss of his head

JESSE
Too late for that Mae

CALEB
Suddenly the hi-beams pop on on the Station Wagon
Calebs eyes dart to the vehicle

INT STATION WAGON - NIGHT

Sarah takes her fingers away from the hi-beam switch
Turns her tear soaked face to Homer
Who is crawling over the front seat
Trying his level best to be charming

HOMER
Sarah everythings gonna be okay
Dont be scared

The Little One pins the little girl down in the seat
She makes like she likes him for a minute

Curling her hand around a large flashlight on the dashboard
Homer smiles lovingly as he inches forward

he wraps his hand over Sarahs wrist

And bears down

Happily

She gulps

Homers face drifts toward hers

His lips curling back in a smile

His teeth near her neck

Sarah quakes

Tears streaming down her cheeks

Fear paralyzing her

The little boy starts to fasten on her neck

His eyes close

EXT ROAD - NIGHT

Calebs face turns leathery
He moves on Jesse

CALEB
Im takin her back

JESSE
Sure you will

The Silvered One smiles

Watching the stark form of Diamondback appear behind Calebs
back

Quietly dropping the pearl handled blade out of her cuff into
her hand

Raiseing it to throw

Jesse silences Mae with a hand over her face

Caleb keeps coming on

INT STATION WAGON - NIGHT

Sarah clubs Homer over the head with the flashlight

A startled Homer breaks his grip for an instant

In that instant Sarah rips open the Station Wagon door and
tears outside

EXT ROAD —- NIGHT

Caleb almost has his hands on Jesse

Diamondback raises the blade behind her head

Mae is too scared to speak

The car door bursts open and the little girl runs wildly down
the street

The farmboy spots her

She spots Diamondback in the nick of time

SARAH
Caleb Look out

Caleb ducks

Diamondback throws the knife

It plunges through the air

Imbedding in Jesses face

The Pale One gasps

The Silvered One snarls in anger pulling out the blade

Caleb dives through the burning wreckage of the truck to sweep
his baby sister up in his arms and carry her off into the night
Jesse takes one handed aim on their fleeing figures with the
Colt Peacemaker

Finger closing on the trigger

Mae knocks into him as the gun GOES OFF

Bullet hitting air

The Silvered One whirls on the girl in a red-faced rage

She averts her eyes

EXT FLATLANDS - NIGHT

Caleb takes off into the flatlands that surround the town
Sarah in his arms with her own arms wrapped around his neck
Burying her scared face in his chest
Full moon high and mighty

EXT ROAD - NIGHT

Jesse squints into the fields and sees them hurrying off

He bounds to the Station Wagon and shoves Diamondback in
alongside Homer

Mae stands alone on the road

Her face a maze of emotions

The Silvered One slides behind the wheel and REVS on the ENGINE
HONKS the HORN

JESSE
MAE

She hesitates

Her eyes spill with tears as she ducks into the car
It takes off in a SCREECH of TIRES

Rocketing off the road

EXT FLATLANDS - NIGHT

The distant frantic YIPPING of coyotes

Tall grasses bending in the wind

Dust trailing up beneath Calebs footsteps as he plunders
forward

A flat black twist of sky that shows signs of paling at the
edges

Sarah is tight in his arms

His breathing in loud gasps

He gulps air

The terrain dipping and rising

Holes and ruts

He trips

Falling face first in the dirt

Sarah goes sprawling to the ground in a heap

CALEB
Keep running

Sarah races off

Caleb scrambles to his feet

A shattering pain in his leg

He clutches his ankle

Watching the little girl go

Moonlight glistening on her shiny blonde hair as it flows in the
air with her flight

The farmboy staggers after her

Losing sight of her in the darkness of night

EXT STATION WAGON - FLATLANDS - NIGHT

The vehicle pitches and leaps over the rough land
Two white cones of light floating over the ground
Dust rising in the headlights

Then the figure of a small girl

Running

Smack into the light

Suddenly stopping

Pinned in the lights

EXT FLATLANDS - NIGHT

Caleb running with a limp scans the blackened land
He forages ahead
Listening to a lone shrill cry beneath a slowly brightening sky

SARAH (0S)
CALEB

Caleb swings his head around

Sees a pair of red taillights streaking toward the highway in
the distance

His face explodes in a bloodthirsty scream

CALEB
NOOOOOOO0OO00N0

INT STATION WAGON - PRE-DAWN

Jesses hands tighten around the wheel as he accelerates toward
the road

Diamondback glances toward the back seat

Homer hugs a struggling breathless Sarah to his chest

Face beaming

Mae turns her eys to the back window

Jesses gaze flits to the sky

JESSE
Well take care of him later No
time now

He steers the vehicle up over the last of the fields and out
onto the tarmac

The Wagon picks up speed

EXT ROAD - PRE-DAWN

Caleb lurches onto the highway

In a dead run
Mouth sucking air
Feet pounding the pavement
The taillights moving steadily down the blacktop
He looks up at the sky
Growing paler by the minute
He shakes his fists at the coming day as if beckoning it forth

INT STATION WAGON - PRE-DAWN

Maes eyes still holding out the back window

She sees the speck that is Caleb running after them

Rapidly receding

An agony races behind her gaze

She glances over at Sarah

Homer holding a hand over the little girls mouth and pushing
the hair from the sun warmed skin of her neck

Mae turns back to the window

EXT ROAD - PRE-DAWN

Streaks of light bleaching the sky

Caleb scrambling along the blacktop and broken white lines
Running full steam ahead after the speeding Station Wagon
Lungs almost bursting

INT STATION WAGON - PRE-DAWN

Jesse looks worried as he eyes the sky

Mae returns her sight to Caleb a mere spot on the road
Something in her erupts

She leaps out of her seat

Ripping Sarah from Homers grasp

Scrambling over the backseat

Smashing her arm into the back window

Glass spiderwebbing

She dives out of the moving vehicle with the little girl in her
arms

EXT ROAD - DAWN

Sunrise

Mae slams onto the pavement

Shielding Sarah from the impact with her body

The Station Wagon brakes in an ear-splitting SCREECH of TIRES
Mae and Sarah claw to their feet and start to run to Caleb
Sunlight beginning to singe Maes skin

Calebs face widens in an unbelieving stare

He takes off for them as fast as his feet will carry him
Lungs bleeding

Mae and Sarah putting some yardage between them and the Wagon
Caleb getting close

From out of the rear window of the Station Wagon Homer appears

Leaping onto the pavement and breaking into a dead run
Skin beginning to smoke

Maes skin starting to smoke

Her eyes starting to close

Her feet staggering along the asphalt

The sun cresting the rim of the world

A wall of light like a blazing wave

Her eyes roll up in their sockets

Sarah scampers with all her strength toward her approaching
brother

Homer overtakes Mae screaming in anguish

His hands stretch out to snatch Sarah

Shimmering rays of sun alighting on his body

Igniting like the head of a match

The sparks licking into the air

Then dissolving into pure ash

Inches away from the little girl

As she throws her arms around her brother

And he sweeps her up in his own

Mae is smoking in the sun

Her legs give out from under her

She collapses on the pavement

Caleb throws off his jacket and dives on top of her with it
Using his coat and his body to completely shield her from the
sun

Stroking her hair with his hand

Shushing her

INT STATION WAGON - DAWN

Light streaking the windshield
Diamondback covering her face with a blanket

Jesse letting his skin blacken as his face grows steadily grim

He cranks the wheel savagely turning the vehicle around
Slamming his foot down on the accelerator

EXT ROAD - DAWN

Sarah buries her eyes in her hands at the sight of Homer

Caleb adjusts himself so that he covers every bit of Maes body

Tucking his jacket around her face and kissing her hair
An ENGINE NOISE makes him lift his head

He looks into the nose of the Station Wagon bearing down on him

He sucks wind
Shouts to his sister

CALEB
Sarah get out of the way

She backs onto the road shoulder panic in her eyes

Caleb stares into the windshield of the Wagon

And locks eyes with the silver haired driver

A venom passes between that look

The sun rising in the sky

Heating up the blacktop

Caleb folds his arms around the still body of Mae on the ground
A single tear drops to the dust

The light grows bright

Day has arrived

Caleb stares steel into the Silvered Ones eyes through the
sunshiney windshield

The Wagon nears

Sarah screams

CALEB
Roast

The daylight like a nuclear afterburn ripping through the
transparent windshield

Hitting Jesse square in the chest

A fire begins to glow in the drivers seat

A fire that was Jesse Hooker

The Station Wagon blows to smithereens

A silence falls

The lone road stretching for miles and miles

Sunlight rising up over the land

A shaken farmboy huddles on top of the young girl in the middle
of the road

A little girl comes over and cries into her big brothers arms
A small fire burns beside a larger fire

Smoke curling up

A gentle breeze blowing down

THE SCREEN SLOWLY FADES TO COMPLETE BLACKNESS
NOTHING BUT DARK

INT VETERINARIAN OPERATING ROOM - COLTON FARM —- DAY

Blinding eruption of blazing daylight

A pair of hands have thrown open the shutters

The sun so high in the sky splashing the room with light
Caleb stands aside anxiously watching someone on the table
Mae is spread out

The blood transfusion apparatus rising above her

A bandage on her arm

The weakened wearied farmboy fingers a bandage on his own arm
Sarah and Loy stand by waiting

Caleb walks over to the girl and lightly shakes her

After a moment her eyes open

She sees the sun staring her in the face
She cries out

Mae grabs onto Calebs shirt and clings to him desperately
Then she realizes

She isnt burning

Her eyes jump to Calebs

The farmboy gives his sister and his father a smile

He hugs his girl to him

Her breathless whisper in his ear

MAE
Whats happening

CALEB
Ill show you

He takes her by the hand

Mae blinks with the attitude of a newborn infant

Not believing she is still alive in the face of the sun
Getting off the table she walks with Caleb to the window and
stands

Gazing out in wonderment at the sprawling fields and sunny
flatlands

The bruises and welts on her face are beginning to heal
There is a tear in her eye as she looks over to Caleb

CALEB
Cmon outside

She goes with him out the door

EXT COLTON FARM - DAY

A wall of sunlight on the pastoral fields at high noon
The animals in the pens

Dogs scampering about

Caleb walks through the fields with Mae on his arm

She just starts giggling

Looking around her

Smelling the fresh air

Seeing all the daytime farm sights

Caleb puts his arm around her

Hes been there

CALEB
Kinda nice huh

They lean back against a fence
Their eyes meet

And their lips

A loving embrace

Long and warm
The farmhouse small behind them

The front door opening

Somebody small smiling out

Sarah taking off in a dead run for her brother

Beneath the bright sun in a talcum blue sky

She yelps

Jumps back inside

Recoiling into the cooling darkness of the farmhouse
Looking at the wisp of smoke rising from the skin of her

FADE OUT
