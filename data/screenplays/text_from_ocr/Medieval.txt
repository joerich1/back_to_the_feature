GYPSY (VO)
Shut and listen I will tell you a
story Our story The names are not
important History will not
remember us Only the consequences
of our actions It is the story of
the greatest heist ever pulled The
story of how our world died and
yours was born The truth You know
how it ended This is how it began

INT JAIL CELL - DUSK

Fetid would be an understatement Vile’s close but doesn’t
quite do it justice Our not so Magnificent Seven -- A GYPSY
A ZULU A SHAOLIN MONK A VIKING A SAMURAI AN ARAB and a
KNIGHT strangers with nothing in common save for a communal
date with the executioner -- await the inevitable

Dying sun casts crooked shadows on the dirt floor They spell
CHAPTER I THE GATHERING

Gypsy’s feet trample the words erasing them from screen
20s tall dark but not handsome You don’t stay pretty for
long in his world

GYPSY
Hey I’m innocent Hey Hey I was
judge-fucked Hey

Zulu stands by the window looking out at the fading light
Viking back against a far wall stares at nothing lost ina
sea of memories Arab sits in one corner Monk in another
prayer beads passing through his fingers Knight is asleep
Samurai is trying to scratch his name into the stone with a
piece of wood It SNAPS like the proverbial last straw

SAMURAI
Are you going to whine all night

GYPSY
Careful friend or the good people
of this city may not have the
opportunity to hang your proper

SAMURAI
Any time gyppo

PUSH IN ON GYPSY

GYPSY
When you call me that smile
INT TENEMENT - DAY (FLASHBACK)

WHAM a door EXPLODES off its hinges revealing our Gypsy
running as if his life depends on speed At the moment it does

Because behind him hauling ass in pursuit are four THUGS
with truncheons in their hands and murder in their eyes

Reality is a blur smeared into staccato impressions

Gypsy parkours around the corner more bad guys incoming
shit he jumps up grabs an overhead pipe slides over their
heads Bodychecks the last thug into the wall A closed
window looms he dives through it straight into-

EXT ROOFTOPS - CONTINUOUS - DAY

A medieval metropolis lies before us like a human anthill
It’s nameless and vast instantly assaulting our senses with
a battery of sounds sights and smells Think New York for
the Middle Ages But the scenic tour will have to wait cause-

Gypsy plummets to the ground a thug hot on his heels Both
in free fall Gypsy grabs a laundry line breaks it SNAP
Swings along the side of the building swashbuckler style
Rolls onto the roof Yep he’s that good

The thug isn’t Wilhelm SCREAM THUD Gravity’s a bitch
Gypsy sprints for the edge arms pumping like pistons Soars
over the gap The rest of the posse follow matching him jump
for jump One Two Three The fourth one slips CRUNCH gets
a broken ankle for his efforts

Rapidly approaching the end of the block A sheer drop yawns
ahead Gypsy powers toward it

LEAD THUG
Give it up

He doesn’t seem to know the meaning of the word Launches--
EXT STREET - DAY

Sails through the air from four stories up Hits the canvas
top of a moving ox drawn cart RIPS through it Tumbles out

of the back And he’s off again

Knifes between pedestrians vendors and horsemen over under
and around leaving a mess in his wake cuts into an alley--

WHAM Gypsy’s JACKED UPWARD as if plucked by an invisible
hand The world rotates 180 degrees What the-

That’s because he’s hanging upside down in a heavy net
Hunters converge Everyone is too drained to speak Until
GYPSY
I swear to God it wasn’t me

LEAD THUG
Then why were you running boyo

GYPSY
Habit

They cut him down Shove him against the wall none too
gently The leader produces a nasty looking blade And just
as we expect him to carve our hero like a Christmas turkey

He slices Gypsy’s jacket open A purse falls out

GYPSY
Mine Constable

That’s right The thugs are actually cops The good guys The
afore-mentioned Constable extracts another purse

GYPSY
It’s been a good year (beat more
purses) A very good year

A string of pearls follows

GYPSY
For my sweetheart

And a diamond encrusted cross

GYPSY
I’m a deeply religious man

CONSTABLE
So is the Bishop from whom this was
stolen You’re wanted gyppo Top
of the list

GYPSY
Gentlemen gentlemen this is alla
misunderstanding A coincidence I
assure you Here allow me prove it

He delivers a swift kick to the guys nuts One of the cops
swings a sap SMASH TO BLACK

INT JAIL CELL - EVENING (RESUME PRESENT )
Gypsy vs Samurai Fight in 5-4-3-2-
KNIGHT

(eyes still closed)
Let it go
Guess he’s not quite as asleep as we figured Samurai shifts
his attention toward Knight contemplating the variety of
ways in which he can slaughter this man Chuckles ruefully

PUSH IN ON SAMURAI He’s young Cruelly handsome A rock star

SAMURAI
You’re right He’s not worth killing
No one will know about it anyway

INT BROTHEL - DAY (FLASHBACK)

WHAM a PUNCH lands Another Blood spurts Two men their
hands wrapped in resin studded with shards of broken glass
tear into one another like wild dogs All around them pimps
whores pushers and other assorted scum CHEER and make bets
We rise up above the arena through the ceiling and over the
bed where we conclude our journey on-

INT ROOM —- DAY

Samurai’s face as he listens to the CLAMOR of the crowd below
A thin smirk dances on his lips never reaching the vacant eyes

WOMAN (0OS)
Remember our arrangement

He shifts his attention toward a semi-naked woman This isnt
post-coital bliss More like disgust Grabs her by the wrist
drawing her into a rough kiss

SAMURAI
Remind me again

She SLAPS him He SLAPS her back Then kisses her again She
resists Then surrenders Reminds him

INT BROTHEL - DAY

Back in the arena attendants mop off blood and broken teeth
The mob is hungry for more A Spanish swordsman covered in
glory and scars steps into the ring A volley of wagers

SPECTATOR 1
Japanese six moves

SPECTATOR 2
Spaniard seven

SPECTATOR 3
Japanese nine

Spaniard doesn’t allow himself to be distracted He’s as sharp
as the fabled Toledo steel he wields Waits for his opponent

Finally Samurai swaggers into the ring Ali minus the gloves
SAMURAI
(tosses a purse to a bookie)
One move

Betters freeze for a beat processing this Then a renewed
frenzy of activity as everyone jumps in on the action

Spaniard nods ready to rumble Samurai doesn’t return the
favor Scratches Stretches Then just as we brace ourselves
for the greatest duel in the history of modern cinema

SAMURAI
Before we begin you should know that
your wife came to me She offered
herself in exchange for sparing your
life So I took her offer Twice

On Spaniard Can’t wont believe it But then he sees his
wifes face in the crowd Her secret Her shame

He ROARS with blind rage and charges

Samurai cuts him down with one casual stroke flicks the
blood off the blade and slides it back into the scabbard
before the body hits the ground

The SHRIEK of the widow is drowned by the CHEER of the mob
Right on cue a battering ram SPLINTERS the door It’s a-

BOOKIE
RAID

INT JAIL CELL - EVENING (RESUME PRESENT )
Samurai takes in the surroundings The filth The company

SAMURAI
Never thought it would end like this

ZULU
How did you think it would end

His stare remains fixed on the world beyond the bars

SAMURAI
With a sword in my hand In battle
against men Not with a noose
around my neck next to a slave

PUSH IN ON ZULU His bare back is a mesh of scars Some
ancient Some fresh A roadmap of pain

ZULU
I was born in chains Tomorrow I die
in them next to an ass So I guess
neither one of us gets what he wants
EXT SLAVE MARKET - DAY (FLASHBACK)

The DIN of the auction Buyers argue with sellers as they
poke prod and fondle the merchandize

Zulu sits under the scorching sun Awaits his turn

Unlike those who bid on them the slaves are silent Men
Women Children Young Old Rich Poor All races classes
and creeds mixed together now equal in their inequality

A pack of exotic animals are caged across from their human
counterparts Lions Panthers Zebras A giraffe peers
curiously at the commotion

Zulu’s gaze settles on a mangy tiger Flies crawl over his
once magnificent hide It doesn’t bother to shoo them away

Their eyes connect Each recognizing something in the other

VOICE (0S)
That one

Zulu looks up at the MAN looming over him A BEDUIN TRADER
sidelines working his greasy charm

TRADER
Ah you don’t want him my friend
This one is rotten Foonta Come
now I have a sweet supple-

MAN
Him (to Zulu) Get up
Trader reinforces the request with a kick Slowly Zulu
complies The man inspects his powerful frame

MAN
Open your mouth (no reaction) Is he
deaf Open your mouth

Zulu doesn’t budge The buyer tries to pry his jaws open

TRADER
I told you he’s trouble If it was
anyone but your master I’d be glad
to be rid of him But I don’t cross
my customers At least not the ones
who can cross me back

MAN
Youre a credit to your profession
But taming a wild beast is half the
fun

He swings a cane Punctuates each word with a savage BLOW
MAN
Open Your Mouth

Zulu staggers to remain upright Swallows the pain And then

his chapped lips finally move albeit not quite
intended fashion A promise not a threat

ZULU
If you touch me again I’11 kill you

in the

The man grins Since Zulu’s hands are chained behind his

back he can afford to
MAN
You see he’s improving already
Now I know he can speak And that
he has a sense of humor
The cane RISES again Descends--

Zulu HEADBUTTS its owner mid-stroke Breaks his
it into the brain A bloody CRUNCH

The man stands there Blinks once Then pitches

The entire market stops for a split second And
second every slave in it feels free

But only for a second

nose driving

over dead

for that one

Trader’s whip slashes across Zulu’s face Others rush to
help A rain of blows Vicious Relentless Brutal Zulu

refuses to go down Finally does

INT JAIL CELL - EVENING (RESUME PRESENT)

Samurai readies a retort Another voice preempts his

VIKING

Would be a shame if it rained tomorrow

My bones always ache when it rains

SAMURAI
Youre going to die and all you’re
worried about is the weather

VIKING
If I’m going to meet my maker Id
rather do it dry And with dignity

SAMURAI
Ahh a philosopher Tell me oh wise
one what grave manner of sin have
you committed to earn your place
here Stealing chickens Sticking it
into another man’s wife
PUSH IN ON VIKING He’s big and heavy like a chipped chunk
of concrete with arms too long in sleeves too short

VIKING
Murder

INT FORGE —- DAY (FLASHBACK)

Viking’s hammer POUNDS red hot steel shaping a horseshoe
His SON 14 fair haired like his father helps They work as
one Comfortable in each other’s silence

VOICE (0S)
I still say you’re better off making
swords instead of plowshares

They call him HUGH OF THE HAND Life’s been good and he’s
got the threads the tan and the fake jewelry to show for it
The boy glares at the intruder Viking keeps swinging

VIKING
I paid you three weeks ago

HUGH
True But as of this moment rent’s
going up Someone leans on me I have
to lean on you Shite rolls down And
unfortunately for you I got the runs

The kid’s had enough about to jump in--

VIKING
Stay out of this Einar
HUGH

Listen to your father boy He’s
smarter than he looks

Viking tightens his grip on the hammer Hugh takes note

HUGH
There’s that too But somehow I don’t
think you have the stones Or do you

A pregnant pause

VIKING
Bottom shelf Behind the tongs

Hugh digs out a jar of coins Viking’s life savings Shakes
out half into his own purse Then more than half

HUGH
I don’t get you Northman Your kind
are supposed to be fierce bastards
who’d skull-fuck a man just for sport
(MORE )
HUGH (contd)
But not you You always turn the other
cheek Either you are Christ Or a
coward Either way it’s a pleasure
doing business with you

He walks out Einar stares at his father Disgusted Ashamed

EINAR
Why

Viking doesn’t look him in eye Keeps POUNDING the steel as
if trying to take out his frustration on it

VIKING
Some day you’ll understand

Beat He turns around But his son is already gone
EXT STREET - DAY
Hugh strolls away Einar catches up armed with a chisel

EINAR
Give me back the money

HUGH BACKHANDS him without looking Dangles the purse

HUGH
You got some grit there boy

Einar rushes him again Gets knocked back into the dirt
Blood on his lips Tears in his eyes Hugh is enjoying this

HUGH
Look on the bright side At least
you are nothing like your father
If he is your father Personally I
doubt he was even man enough to
knock up your whore of a mother

He senses movement Flicks his eyes off the boy toward Viking
running toward them Grins prepares

Which is when Einar lunges--

VIKING
Einar Don’t

Too late The chisel sinks into Hugh’s chest Red and wet

Hugh stares at Einar in disbelief seeing his own terror
reflected in the boy’s eyes It’s as if for one haunting
heartbeat time freezes searing the image into their
respective retinas before--

Hugh collapses Viking kneels beside him trying to staunch
the wound Hugh whimpers Not so tough anymore

HUGH
Don’t let me die Please

Blood seeps through the fingers

VIKING
I am sorry

Hugh’s fading fast A weak smirk And a whisper
HUGH
Tell it to your son when they
hang him
He dies as he lived - poorly
viking rises to his feet Looks at the gathering mob At his

son shaking with panic and desperation Wishing he could
make it all go away Wishing he could wake up Wishing

VIKING

Go home Ill take care of this
EINAR

Father
VIKING

(a sudden roar)
Isaid go

INT JAIL CELL - EVENING (RESUME PRESENT )
Gypsy stretches bored

GYPSY
Id give my left testicle for a
drink Or a decent meal Or a woman
Or a guard with the key so I could
go get myself a drink a decent meal
and a woman

KNIGHT
You ever think about anything other than
drinking eating whoring or stealing

GYPSY
It’s what I do best (beat) So what
are you in for

KNIGHT
Being a good Samaritan

GYPSY
Serves you right It’s a dog eat
dog world old man Should have
learned it by now

Knight eyes still closed smiles to himself

GYPSY
Did I say something funny

KNIGHT
What do you know of the world You’ve
never set foot outside this city
Think you’re special There’s a
hundred of you in every shithole town
from here to Damascus You’re nothing
but a petty thief who’ll die just as
you lived - broke ignorant and
alone And for your information boy
dogs don’t eat dogs Unlike us they
have enough intelligence not to
destroy their own kind

On Gypsy First flicker of emotion in those dusky eyes
GYPSY
And yet tomorrow you hang with the rest
of us What does that say about you

PUSH IN ON KNIGHT as he finally looks at his cellmate It’s
not the years it’s the mileage Nothing but the truth

KNIGHT
That I’m as big of a fool as you
The only difference is I know it
INT TAVERN - SUNSET (FLASHBACK)

Dice rolls Another loss the latest in a long line

DEALER
Tough luck Wanna try again

KNIGHT
Not my day

He slams down a drink Rises unsteadily to his feet

KNIGHT
Which way to the harbor

DEALER
North Where you headed

Knight shrugs Like he cares

DEALER
Stick around Word is the king and
his brother are calling for another
Crusade They are raising an army
to liberate the Holy Land

KNIGHT
I’ve been there There’s nothing
holy about it And nothing worth
liberating

DEALER
Bullshit I hear the Pope himself-

KNIGHT
I hear were all dead and this is
hell I hear the meek shall inherit
the earth I even hear the world is
round Perhaps all of it is true
Perhaps none Either way I just
don’t give a damn any more

EXT TAVERN - SUNSET
Knight unties his horse Walks away Passes by
EXT ALLEY - SUNSET

A wolfpack of mercs surround a young woman A girl
practically They are about to well you figure it out

MERC
What’s the matter sweetheart You
don’t fancy us no more

GIRL
Help Help

Nobodys coming Nobody ever comes

Knight watches without expression One of the soon to be
rapists becomes aware of his presence Grins

MERC
You got three choices mate Fuck
her when were finished Fuck off
Or get fucked
The girl pleads silently eyes filled with tears with hope

Knight turns away Resumes his journey Whats one more
injustice in a world defined by injustice

Merc grabs the girl Mouth at her ear
MERC
Go ahead Scream (a sick smile)
Scream for daddy

Her eyes widen But not because of Merc Because-

Knight is back

SNAPS Merc’s neck Cleaves his buddy’s skull Splits a torso
Eviscerates the third

The last Merc hides behind the girl Dagger at her throat

LAST MERC
Move and she-

Knight throws the sword It PLOWS through the guy’s head mid-
ultimatum pins him against the wall like a butterfly The
afore-mentioned dagger falls out of his lifeless hand CLANKS
harmlessly on the cobblestones

The girl stares Not sure if she should be grateful for her
rescue Or terrified of the man who brought it about

KNIGHT
Next time don’t cry for help Yell
“Fire” Everyone comes running

Speaking of which FOOTFALLS approach He turns ready for more

Here comes the local law Their CAPTAIN eyes the carnage The
guy with a sword through his noggin still twitching in the
afterlife Then the blood-splattered Knight Judging by his
unfazed expression for him this is Tuesday

CAPTAIN
Let me guess Self defence

KNIGHT
We had a difference of opinion on
the subject of carnal relations

CAPTAIN
Cute Got a witness

KNIGHT
Sure Ask the girl

CAPTAIN
Girl What girl

Knight looks around Shes already gone A tired mantra

KNIGHT
Not my day

INT JAIL CELL - EVENING (RESUME PRESENT )

Darkness falls Arab begins to sing softly in his native
tongue It’s a quiet lament haunting and otherworldly like
an exotic bird flapping wings in its cage

ZULU
Sounds pretty

KNIGHT
Don’t let him fool you He’s
Hashshashin A killer

GYPSY
Like you

KNIGHT

No Not like me When I kill a man

I look him in the eye
PUSH IN ON ARAB His delicate features are that of a poet or
scholar rather than a member of the dreaded sect of
assassins which gave birth to the word itself SMASH TO
EXT BAZAAR - DAY (FLASHBACK )
A carnival of spices silk cobras camels chickens chilled
monkey brain pots relics beggars bargains exotic loud
raw all of it tossed at us at dizzying pitch and pace
Suddenly its quiet Dead quiet
EXT ROOFTOP - SAME TIME

Tight on Arab’s eye as it studies the three ring circus
below with the aid of a rudimentary spyglass His POV

A roll of fabric sways gently in the afternoon breeze
Sun glitters off jewels and glass works

A WELL DRESSED MAN clearly someone of importance wades
through the crowd surrounded by his five man escort

Back to Arab We widen the shot to reveal that the afore-
mentioned spyglass is attached to the frame of a compound
Mongol bow And then its owner lets go of the string

We are the arrow that travels 400 yards -- past a stray
pigeon between hanging rugs through the spokes of a wheel --
gleaming as it comes out of the sun thanks to tiny fragments
of glass embedded in its shaft -- blinding the bodyguards for
a split second and hitting the target

Dead Fucking Center

Bodyguards recover Cluster around the corpse trying to
process what the hell just happened We leave them to it

Back to the rooftop It’s already empty
EXT ADJACENT STREET —- DAY

Arab melts into the foot traffic Moves with the herd hiding
in plain sight Just another lowly merchant

Up ahead guards are blocking off the street Too late to turn
back Too crowded to run He keeps moving Approaches the
roadblock Closer Closer Almost through

GUARD (0S)
You there Halt

Arab is a pro Had to end sometime Everything does
INT JAIL CELL - EVENING (RESUME PRESENT )

SAMURAI
One idiot shuts up Another takes
his place (to Arab) Silence
Quiet Shh Do you understand me

Apparently not What we have here is failure to communicate

ZULU
I wonder what he’s singing about

MONK (0S)
Home

He’s been so quiet we’ve almost forgotten he’s there

MONK
The song is a story A story of a man
far away from his land longing to
return Somewhere across oceans and
mountains there is a place filled
with beauty and promise A home of his
ancestors A woman who’s waiting for
him Sometimes they are so close he
can almost touch them (beat) But he
knows he will never see them again
Because he can’t go back Because he’s
not what he once was Because he’s
lost And so all that is left is the
road and a dream of what can never be

VIKING
Where did you learn his language

PUSH IN ON MONK An aura of detached calm wrapped around him
like his worn robes

MONK
I didn’t

INT TEMPLE - DAY (FLASHBACK)
The light of a candle reflected in Monk’s eyes

Incense fumes spiral toward the heavens Enormous statue of
Buddha towers over the lone worshipper

Monk searches his serene inscrutable face Looking for
answers Finding none

ABBOT (0S)
You should eat

An old ABBOT holds a meager bowl of rice Without turning

MONK
I’m not hungry

ABBOT
You’ve been praying for hours And in
my experience enlightenment is rarely
attained on an empty stomach

MONK
I don’t want enlightenment

ABBOT
Then what is it you want

The flame of the candle moves almost imperceptibly caught by
the tiniest of drafts Monk’s eyes find Abbot’s

MONK
You already know what I want

Slowly Abbot nods

ABBOT
Yes A man came to me He said
you boarded a ship bound for this
place That sooner or later you’d
come here That I could be a rich
man if I told him when Or a dead
one if I didn’t (beat) I am sorry

Soldiers emerge from the shadows Dozens of them Monk makes
no attempt to resist To Abbot

MONK
-Pray for me I cannot

Temple bell TOLLS Perhaps it tolls for Monk
INT JAIL CELL - EVENING (RESUME PRESENT )

SAMURAI
Well that settles it I’m in hell

VOICE (0S)
Not yet But soon enough I imagine

Heads turn to face a short well groomed man standing by the
bars It’s as if he materialized out of thin air

MAN
Good evening gentlemen I am your
attorney

KNIGHT

Seeing how we’ve already been
tried convicted and sentenced Id
say you either lost or late

LAWYER
Neither However as time is of the
essence Ill come straight to the
point I am here to offer you an
opportunity

GYPSY
Hhmmm Last time I heard those
words I believe I lost money

LAWYER
This time you will gain your freedom

That gets everyone’s attention

ZULU
I didn’t catch your name friend

LAWYER
My name is not nearly as relevant as
your current predicament or my
proposal Suffice it to say I
represent a person of considerable
influence who is willing to broker
your release in return for the
completion of a small and simple task

VIKING
Define “small”

LAWYER
One job One night’s work Break
into the royal palace Retrieve a
certain item Return it to me

KNIGHT
And those of us who might survive
this “simple” task

LAWYER
Will be rich beyond measure

We PAN over the faces of the men as they study the lawyer
processing the deal weighing the risks working the angles

GYPSY
--Why us

LAWYER
(nods toward Arab)
Ask your cellmate He already knows

Arab’s voice has no accent So much for the language barrier

ARAB
Because none but the mad or the
desperate would undertake this action
(beat) We apparently are both

They digest it grim Off that
INT LAWYER’S OFFICE - NIGHT

Last Supper Gypsy piles enough to feed a small village on a
plate joins the others As they eat

LAWYER
His Majesty is quite protective of his
person and his treasure In order to
thwart those who may desire to claim
either he has commissioned an
extensive array of security measures
Good news is we know what and where
they are At least most of them

ARAB
And the bad

LAWYER
The man who designed them was a
genius One of your people I believe

KNIGHT
Can he be found

LAWYER
Yes In the graveyard Our king found
it prudent to dispose of not only the
keep’s plans but also its planner
Here’s what we do know

EXT CITYINT PALACE - NIGHT
The following happens in one continuous shot

PULL BACK fast and furious flying through the window and over
the city toward the palace seeing firsthand what he describes

LAWYER (VO)
The wall is the height of ten men
Sentries are Varangian Guard
King’s elite mercenary corps
Double patrols at night plus dogs
That’s the easy part

(MORE )

LAWYER(contd)
Beyond it on the far side of the
Great Hall is the sole means of
entry into the king’s quarters
Which is where things get tricky

We melt through the walls of the palace tracking alongside a
comely chamber maid as she walks toward-

LAWYER (VO)

First there is an archway of rather
unique design No metal object -- no
matter how small or carefully
concealed -- can pass through it

The maid’s earrings levitate as if pulled toward the ceiling
by some invisible force She hands them to a guard standing
by the mouth of the passage More loom on the other side
Their armor is made out of leather Iron bolt tips have been
replaced by flint Ivory spears Obsidian swords

LAWYER (VO)

Which means you’1ll not be able to use
your weapons to get past the guards
But they will be able to use theirs

Moving further

LAWYER (VO)

Beyond it is a corridor They call it
“The Nightingale Floor” Even the
slightest step will produce a distinct
chirping sound which will alert the
guards It will also activate a
mechanism hidden within its walls

We sink below the surface following a web of silver wires
toward a battery of crossbows lined along the length of the
hallway An understatement of the century

LAWYER (VO)
I suggest you do not trigger it

We streak past the razor sharp arrowheads through the walls
and back inside the corridor zeroing in on-

LAWYER (VO)

At the end of the passage there is a
door the only key to which the king
keeps on his person at all times Once
the lock is touched you will have thirty
beats of a resting heart to open it

Through the keyhole inside the lock itself an elaborate maze
of springs and wheels topped by an hourglass connected to-

GYPSY (VO)
And if we don’t

Spikes Long gleaming

LAWYER (VO)
You die

Spikes release right into our face BLACK
INT LAWYER’S OFFICE - NIGHT
Silence speaks volumes Then

VIKING
It can’t be done

LAWYER
For your sake I hope you’re wrong Once
through the door you’1l be inside the
treasury Its riches are as grand as the
means employed to defend them Feel free
to take as much as you can carry All my
master desires is the crown

ARAB
Every job needs a getaway plan Timing
Precision Patience We’ll need a week-

LAWYER
Tonight Non-negotiable

Gypsy is the first one to rise

GYPSY
Well it’s been fun

He heads for the door Others follow The attorney is unfazed
LAWYER
I take it it’s your intention not
to honor our agreement
SAMURAI
If I decide to commit suicide I’1l
do it my way Not yours

ZULU
As much as I hate to agree

GYPSY
But thanks for the free meal

He grabs an apple Takes a bite--

LAWYER
What makes you think it was free

Gypsy stops mid chomp as it dawns on them

LAWYER
That’s right Poison Tasteless
Odorless And utterly deadly

Arab moves Hand on Lawyer’s throat fingers like a vise

ARAB
Antidote You have three seconds

His target may be about to lose his life but not his cool

LAWYER
You disappoint me Do you actually
believe I would be foolish enough to
carry it on my person Besides any
harm you intend to do me pales in
comparison to the wrath of my employer
should I fail in my task So

Arab weighs the man and the moment Releases

LAWYER
The poison is activated by sunlight
I’m told the effects are rather
unpleasant I expect to see you here
tomorrow before the sun crests the
horizon You will give me the crown
And I will give you the cure

Pauses on the threshold A small smile

LAWYER
Good night And good luck

And he’s out A silent beat like calm before the storm

GYPSY
Ah fuck

INT LAWYERS OFFICE - LATER

They get ready Sharpening blades Checking and re-checking
their gear The mood is well how would you feel if you
were about to go on a suicide mission Yeah Kinda like that

Each wields a signature weapon Longsword for Knight Bow for
Arab Spears for Zulu Throwing knives and short sword for
Gypsy Battle axe for Viking Katana and Wakizashi for
Samurai Last but not least

GYPSY
What about him

Monk sits quietly in the corner deep in meditation

KNIGHT
He’s a Shaolin monk (off Gypsy’s look)
He doesn’t need a weapon He is one
Can you pick a lock

GYPSY

Do I look like a common thief
KNIGHT

Yes
GYPSY

Then I can pick a lock

Samurai runs a whetting stone along the edge of the katana
Listens to the vibration a musician fine-tuning his
instrument Zulu approaches

SAMURAI
Don’t

Zulu ignores him sits across tests spears for balance

SAMURAI
I heard your kind are savages who
dance naked around the fire and eat
human flesh Is that true

ZULU
I heard yours were honorable and
polite Apparently we were both
misinformed

Samurai rises slowly Zulu doesn’t Then

SAMURAI
I won’t soil my sword on you

He strides away settles near Viking Resumes the ritual

VIKING
A fine blade

SAMURAI
What would you know of fine blades

VIKING
I know that it took fourteen days and
three men to forge it I know that its
steel was folded twelve times forming
over four thousand layers to burn off
its impurities and increase its
strength And I know that you’re two
stone strokes off on the left side

Samurai nods surprised Impressed even
SAMURAI
It belonged to my father And his
father before him (beat) They lived
and they died and no one remembers
them The blade endures Glory
endures I will not be like them
blacksmith Iwill be remembered

He lets it sink in

VIKING
It is a fine blade And yet when all
is said and done it kills just like
any other piece of steel (beat) It’s
easy to make a sword To take a life
Much harder to create one To raise
it To make it into a man

He takes Samurai’s place across from Zulu

ZULU
-My name is-

VIKING
I don’t need to know it

Zulu nods accepting the terms To each his own

EXT LAWYER’S OFFICE - PATIO —- NIGHT

Knight gazes out toward the palace Without turning

KNIGHT
We are fucked as the day is long
are we not Arab

The latter approaches from behind

ARAB
Yes (beat) What you said about me
back in the cell About my kind I
know yours Crusader I’ve seen what
you’ve done I’ve smelled it
Thousands of rotting corpses littering
the streets of our cities The ashes
of our mosques The charred bodies of
my wife and children

Knight says nothing Just stares into the night Then

KNIGHT
We all have something to atone for

ARAB
Yes (beat) If we live through
this I will kill you

Knight nods accepting the challenge

KNIGHT
If we live

EXT PALACE WALL —- NIGHT

Flames pass into view A platoon of GUARDS march past the
light of their torches illuminating words etched into stone

CHAPTER II THE HEIST

Gypsy spiderlike hands coated with chalk climbs across the
title No safety lines Moving purely by touch Twenty feet up

The rest of the group Tense Watching

Thirty Forty Almost there Pulls himself upward-

A score of BATS nestled in the crack EXPLODE into his face
Guards run up alerted by the noise Look upward

The sheer surface of the wall disappears into darkness We
move within it to find-

Gypsy dangles above beyond the range of their torches Off
balance teetering his entire body battling the inevitable

GUARD
--Bats

Gypsy’s grip gives He plummets-

Zulu is a blur Cocks and hurls a spear in one fluid motion
It sails through the air digs into the stone Gypsy grabs
the shaft breaking the fall The tips of his feet hover just
inches outside of Guard’s light

CORPORAL reacts to the WHOOSH peers into the night Nothing

CORPORAL
-Aye bats Move ‘em out

They resume their patrol Zulu’s eyes open white on black --
Corporal was close enough to smell him

Gypsy re-establishes his hold Resumes the climb
INT PALACE COURTYARD - NIGHT
Two GUARDS loiter by a small heavily barred gate One of

them yawns WHAM Gypsy drops from above cushioning the fall
with their bodies

CLICK the gate’s lock disengages Knight’s last through catches
Gypsy rifling through the guards’ pockets Hand in the cookie jar

GYPSY
Habit

INT ARCHWAY - PALACE - NIGHT

A large detachment of guards armed with non-metallic
weapons polices the other side Look and mean business

FOOTSTEPS As in someone’s coming toward them through the
arch That’s right folks it’s-

Monk

SERGEANT
Halt

Prayer beads running between his fingers Keeps coming

SERGEANT
I said halt

Bowmen take aim Cut loose Ivory tipped shafts WHISTLE toward-

At the last moment Monk tilts his head to the side an almost
lackadaisical gesture Arrows rip through the space occupied
by it missing him by millimeters

Guards react Still it’s only one man They charge

Monk’s palms thrust outward Air seems to snap A dozen
torches blow out in quick succession Pitch black

SERGEANT
-What the --

CRUNCH A shadow -- one of his own men -- smashes into him All
around motion a blur of robes a face there one instant gone
the next bodies falling weapons slicing into flesh

Finally a torch breathes to life Sergeant holds it with an
unsteady hand Finds himself face to face with Monk

MONK
(calm personified)
How do you turn it off

Sergeant gulps Considers his options Then

SERGEANT
The arch is powered by a stone
They say it fell from the sky Roll
it away and the charge will fail
(beat) Whowhat are you

The answer arrives in the form of Monk’s fist WHAM Sergeant
joins his men Monk grabs the torch before it falls even an inch

INT ARCHWAY —- PALACE - MOMENTS LATER

Monk greets the crew with a simple nod Gypsy eyes the
bodies impressed Knight gives him the “I told you so” look

INT NIGHTINGALE FLOOR - PALACE - NIGHT

They approach the floor It looks about as harmless as a
minefield filled with Bouncing Betties Arab primes an arrow
steel cable attached to its tail

KNIGHT
Hold it

He digs into Gypsy’s pouch Throws a handful of chalk into the
air A miniature White Christmas The powder swirls settling on-

A labyrinth of silver wires stretches from the floor to the
ceiling like a giant spiderweb Medieval infra red beams

Zulu says something in his native tongue No translation required

VIKING
Now what

They trade glances Come up empty
SAMURAI
We go back Torture the son of a
bitch until he coughs up the cure

Close on Arab mind racing

ARAB
No (beat) There’s another way

He rips a strip from his garment Dips it in oil Wraps it
around an arrow shaft To Monk still wielding the torch

ARAB
Light it
He does WHOOSH Arab’s arrow sings through the wires sticks
harmlessly into a brass panel running along the glass top of
the corridor Sits there Burns

GYPSY
A noble effort Now if we can please-

ARAB
Wait

Beat Another And then-

We hear the GRINDING of machine wheels Slowly the wires
retreat into the walls All eyes on Arab Water into wine

ARAB
There had to be an off-switch A way
to shut down the traps during the day
And then to arm them again at night
The king seems to trust machines more
than men He wouldn’t leave the switch
in the hands of his servants And that
panel is lined up exactly with the
direction and the angle of-

KNIGHT
(getting it)
The heat of the rising sun
ARAB
Or that of the flame for as long
as it burns Shall we
INT NIGHTINGALE FLOOR - PALACE - MOMENTS LATER
Cable stretches above the floor Monk and Arab shimmy along
hand over hand Viking lands on the other side light for a
big man Gypsy is at the door picks laid out like a set of
surgical instruments Studies the lock Deep breath And-

GYPSY
Here we go

He slides in the pick We SLIDE in with it

INT LOCK

Instantly the mechanism comes to life The hourglass drains
INT HALLWAY

Gypsy digs around No joy Samurai is counting heartbeats

SAMURAI
Twenty

Gypsy frantically scans his tools Grabs a different pick
Its hook finally catches the pin Lifts it CLICK
Gypsy yanks on the door handle Nothing

GYPSY
Double action

SAMURAI
Fifteen

Gypsy strains The tip of the pick millimeters away from a
lever protected by a series of bends and protrusions

KNIGHT
I thought you were a common thief
GYPSY
It’s not a common lock
SAMURAI
Ten
KNIGHT
Then I should hope I was wrong about
you

Inside the lock the hourglass is almost completely empty now
And Gypsy is getting nowhere Pressure mounting with each count

SAMURAI
Eight seven six

KNIGHT
Take your time boy

The pick makes contact with the lever and slides off

SAMURAI (VO)
Five Four Three

The last of the sand swirls around the opening

SAMURAI (VO)

The pick catches again and
SAMURAI

CLICK No it wasn’t the spikes The lever being pulled The
mechanism WHIRS Bolts slide out

The hourglass One grain left

GYPSY
Told you Piece of cake

He pulls on the handle The door swings open-
Breaking a trip wire on the other end Fuck

Instantly alarms WAIL Double fuck Knight reacts before
anyone else A born leader To Zulu Arab Samurai and Monk

KNIGHT
Get back across Hold them off as
long as you can The rest with me
INT TREASURY - NIGHT
They dash inside Corridor Corner

KNIGHT
Find the crown Quick

Another door They crash through it--

INT BEDROOM - NIGHT

A mortally wounded MAN lies on the bed A PAGEBOY late
teens covered in blood is kneeling over him protecting the

master’s body with his own An ASSASSIN gleaming sword
raised over his head readies a killing blow

Inother words it’s NOT the treasury

Assassin’s blade swings toward the boy stops cold with a
CLANG Our Knight’s sword is there WHAM he SLICES the killer
shoulder to thigh Viking moves to the man checks his vitals

VIKING
Dead

Knight leans over Blanches

KNIGHT
So are we

GYPSY
What the hell are you talking about

Knight tosses him a coin Gypsy catches stares
Close on the coin The dead man’s visage engraved in its surface
KNIGHT

Your king This wasn’t a heist It was

a goddamn assassination Inside man

here does the deed We take the fall
Blood pools on the floor giving birth to red letters

CHAPTER III THE SET-UP

Right on cue four stone doors drop in succession from the
ceiling sealing the intruders -- one two three --

viking slides his axe in the path of the forth stopping the
last slab with inches to spare

VIKING
Move

Gypsy doesn’t have to be told twice Rolls under and out
PAGEBOY
Please sir Take me with you
They’11 kill me if they find me here
Knight ignores the plea The boy seizes his arm desperate
PAGEBOY
I am the only one who knows of your
innocence I can help you

Knight pushes him back hard

VIKING
He’s a witness And we can’t just-

KNIGHT
He’s dead weight No one will believe
him Even if they do we broke into
the palace Think you’1ll have better
luck with the judge this time around

Viking knows he’s right The axe shaft cracks along its axis

KNIGHT
The boy stays

Viking nods grim Slides under Knight is about to follow
PAGEBOY
I know a way out A secret passage
I swear on my life sir

On Knight Split second decision Trust him or

KNIGHT
You just did

He shoves the boy down and under tearing off his cape in the
process follows him through as the axe SHATTERS and the
stone drops with a THUD

INT CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

Rejoin Viking and Gypsy Viking notes the boy shoots a look

KNIGHT
Change of plans

At that moment things that shouldn’t move start to Fast
Walls shift Corridor closes Another appears A jigsaw
puzzle realigning itself They’re forced right then left

Doors open GUARDS spill out Rush toward them

Gypsy throws two knives at the same time a blur of hands and
steel each finding its target Follows it up with a fistful
of chalk powder to the eyes Knight extends his sword like a
scythe runs straight through a throng of temporarily blinded
opponents Blood spatters Viking empty handed grabs a
shield bashes the rest with it All without breaking stride

The ceiling starts to descend

PAGEBOY
This way

INT NIGHTINGALE FLOOR

The rest of the crew can only watch as across the floor
lockdown continues Then they hear it -- hard leather and
polished steel moving towards them at speed

On instinct they spread out Beat

Guards About two dozen of them Charge

Arab fires so quick the second arrow is still in the air before
the first hits its mark One two three four guards drop

Zulu steps in spear spinning An incoming guard gets run
through Shaft SNAPS Zulu drives its jagged end into the
next guard’s throat

Monk punches through a metal chest plate Ribs CRACK
Kneecaps SHATTER WHAM WHAM WHAM three rapid kicks drop as
many men Monk’s foot never bothering to land in between

Samurai just stands there arms crossed Watches the enemy
rush toward him

And then he moves

His blade is a flash Seven guards are cut down with equal
number of strokes dying before they succumb to gravity

A sound behind them They spin ready for more

On the far side of the floor a panel slides open Arab draws-
On Pageboy as he emerges out of the passage followed by
Viking Gypsy and Knight All of them running hard a HORDE

of guards on their tail To Arab

KNIGHT
The flame

Arab instantly shifts his aim and releases shearing the
shaft of the flaming arrow he fired earlier

ARAB
It needs time to cool

Knight halts Grabs the shield from Viking

KNIGHT
Go

Faces the armada Knocks out someone’s front teeth borrows
his shield one in each hand now Uses them like armored
fists SLAMS soldiers into walls Crushes wind pipes
Fractures bones Desperately trying to buy precious seconds
as behind him the others pull themselves across

It’s a losing battle He’s about to be overwhelmed
Arab launches two shafts at the same time dropping a pair

Zulu kicks up a fallen spear catches and hurls it It
skewers the guard about to decapitate Knight catapults him
backward impaling him on the swords of his buddies

Knight turns and runs the horde on his heels
Close on the panel as it turns cold resetting the system

Which is when Knight RIP SLIDES in glorious slow motion a hair
under the incoming razor-sharp trip wire as it slashes into the
feet of the lead guard chopping them off at the ankles The floor
CHIRPS Multiple vibrations travelling along the wires toward-

THE MACHINE we glimpsed earlier As in dozens of arrows fired by
automated chain-fed-spring-loaded crossbows hidden in the walls

The incoming guards are annihilated -- nay erased -- by a
bloody fusillade of steel tipped death

INT HALLWAY
Knight rejoins the rest of the crew On the run

ARAB
The crown

KNIGHT
He didn’t want the crown He wanted
the man who wears it It appears the
king had a reason to be paranoid

ARAB
Then there is no antidote

KNIGHT
We’ll see He won’t be expecting us to
return that’s for sure Either way
if we live through this he wont

ARAB
If we live

INT ARCHWAY - NIGHT

The crew hurtles down the stairs heading for the arch Monk peels
off waits in deep shadow for the others to pass More guards
close in rush past Monk without noticing him into the passage

Monk shoves the meteor back into place The positively
charged stone pushes up against the negatively charged arch
reactivating the magnet Physics 101

The guards -- all clad in mail and armor -- are jerked upward
into the spikes In an instant twenty men reduced to gore

And below them Monk just walks on through blood spattering
the floor like red rain

INT GREAT HALL — NIGHT

The crew sprints for the main doors stops cold Troops are
pouring in from every angle Nowhere to run They get ready

PAGEBOY
Here

He pulls a lever A door appears They dash inside Gypsy
gives pursuers the finger as the door seals shut

INT TUNNELS - PALACE - NIGHT
Pageboy holds a torch Behind him the crew hauls ass

KNIGHT
You know the palace well

PAGEBOY
I was born and raised within its
walls (beat) Back in the bedroom
You saved my life Why

KNIGHT
Why were you willing to sacrifice
yourself for your master

PAGEBOY
(point taken)
The man you killed He was one of
the king’s most trusted bodyguards
I never thought he was capable-

KNIGHT
You want to know how to stay alive Take
a good man and imagine the worst thing
it would never cross his mind to do
(MORE)

KNIGHT (contd)
Then assume he’s already done it twice
Besides your dead friend was just the
knife Someone else is the hand Do you
know who

PAGEBOY
(shakes his head)
Do you
KNIGHT

Not yet But I have a pretty good
idea who might

A door looms ahead They go through it-
EXT ALLEY - NIGHT

To find themselves outside the walls Behind them the palace
is alive with light sound and motion

KNIGHT
How long until sunrise

ZULU
Not long enough

They sprint off into the dissolving darkness
INT LAWYER’S OFFICE - DAWN
Door’s thrown open The crew soaked in sweat rush in-

The place is empty Not a single piece of furniture No
lawyer No antidote Just blank walls

GYPSY
Fuck Fuck FUCK

Knight sinks to the floor spent To Arab

KNIGHT
If you still intend to kill me I
suggest you hurry up

ARAB
-I think there’s been enough
blood for one night

Gypsy desperately searches for something anything to cover
up the windows

GYPSY
We could hide Stay out of the sun

SAMURAI
Live in a cellar Hide in the
shadows for the rest of our lives

ZULU
I will not trade one cage for another

The sun crests the horizon

KNIGHT
Get out of here boy You don’t
need to see this

PAGEBOY
--I’1l stay

Gypsy backs up Others stand their ground waiting for the
inevitable Zulu begins to chant Arab and Knight lock eyes

ARAB
I will see you in hell Crusader

KNIGHT
I’1l be there

Sunlight sweeps toward them like a tsunami Monk steps out on
the balcony palms out accepting his fate Perhaps even
welcoming it The sun crashes over him

Nothing happens

The rest join Monk Light cascades over them To no effect

SAMURAI
Another trick Damn I’m actually
starting to admire the bastard

VIKING
Now what

ZULU
We leave town

ARAB
They’1l be expecting that There will
be roadblocks all over the city

Gypsy heads for the door Samurai blocks his path

GYPSY
Get out of my way

SAMURAI
Why So you can crawl to the first
soldier you see and sell the rest
of us out gyppo

GYPSY
(hand falling on his knives)
When you call me that

Samurai cold as ice smiles Two gunslingers ready to draw

ZULU
Fools There are ten thousand men
out there ready to kill you both
and you’d save them the trouble

SAMURAI
Keep out of this slave or you’1ll
be next

Zulu snaps up his spear tensing The room is like a
gunpowder keg All you need is a match

ARAB
So this is how it ends We kill
each other like caged animals

GYPSY
Why not Beats dying out there

KNIGHT
How about living

He’s got their attention

GYPSY
Seven of us Against an army

KNIGHT
Yes And alone we will surely die
But together we might have a chance

MONK
How

KNIGHT
By doing the unexpected By working
as one We go to ground Lay low
Eventually they’1l have to loosen
their hold That’s when we move

Beat They all know he’s right

GYPSY
I know someone who might help

fitting color for this place

Another angle revels the object of their veneration -- EDWARD
THE BLACK 40s the younger brother to the slain monarch This
man is handsome smart powerful and above all dangerous
Trailing him are BROTHER GREGORY a Celestine Monk and Edwards
Consigliere and CAPTAIN OF THE GUARDS The latter isn’t happy

CAPTAIN
We lost a lot of good men

If they were any good they wouldn’t
be lying on the floor What of Amelia

INT ROYAL CHAMBERS - PALACE - MORNING

ordered Your Grace

Two minutes That’s how far apart we
were born 120 seconds later the
world would have been a different

belong on that throne But he was
still my brother And I loved him

It doesn’t matter It’s done Who
else has seen this

Just those four Your Grace I can
vouch for their loyalty and discretion

discretion can we Gregory

May I have your sword Captain

Your sword

Captain draws the item in question offers it to Edward
pommel first Edward accepts it and promptly drives it into
the man’s chest He drops to his knees gurgling blood
Edward casually returns the blade to the owner’s scabbard

EDWARD
You’1l take care of the rest won’t
you Gregory

Gregory utterly unfazed by the murder bows his head

GREGORY
And the intruders

EDWARD
They killed a king Worse they killed
my brother I can’t very well allow
such men to walk the streets can I

GREGORY
Naturally Shall I summon the
Captain’s replacement

Edward’s eyes land on Pageboy’s cape balled up on the floor
picks it up examines it as he contemplates the next move

No These men are criminals Seal the
gates triple the patrols and they’1ll
scurry off to hide among their own

INT TAVERN — MORNING

Laughter rich and deep echoes through what could kindly be
called a cave Flashes of Mos Eisley cantina Light streams
in from the shuttered ceiling illuminating the bare walls
dozens of hardened KILLERS and THIEVES as well as a few
SERVING WENCHESWHORES navigating between tables

Presiding over one is the source of the baritone laugh He is
FREDERICK a bear of a man and as close to the king of
the gypsies as you’re going to get

FREDERICK

You really screwed the pooch this
time didn’t you nephew They’re
turning this shithole of a city
upside down looking for you

(savoring the word)
Regicide

(to Gypsy almost proud)
Didn’t know you had it in you

(to the rest of our crew)
You’d think I was the one who
fucked his mother

GYPSY
Im telling you it wasn’t-

FREDERICK
Sure sure You’re innocent You were
framed The judge fucked you Ask any
man here you’ll hear the same

GYPSY
Believe what you want Can you help us

FREDERICK
Can Yes Should That’s a different
matter I’m not in the habit of
risking my neck for anything other
than a purse or a pussy But you are
Roma And you’re blood And in my
house that still counts for something

He motions to a passing wench She fills their goblets
Frederick cops a feel She giggles Knight rises to his feet

Which way is-

Gypsy’s lips are about to touch the edge of the goblet

Silence Then motion A lot of it

The entire tavern seemingly oblivious of our heroes’
existence a moment ago is now brimming with weapons trained
on our crew who instantly turn theirs on Frederick and his
entourage A John Woo moment with swords

FREDERICK
The odds are not in your favor nephew
Any one of these men will kill for me

Samurai slashes at the closest opponent

For a moment the poor schmuck just stands there His sword
SNAPS Then his helmet slides off in two pieces Then the
skull itself splits open in a geyser of red The dead man
collapses on the floor Both halves of him

Apparently they are also not in the
habit of risking their necks for

It’s not why It’s who And when In
our case from the very beginning

Holding the captured girl

Think about it How all of us ended up
in that cell Seven strangers each of
whom just happened to have the skills
to break into an impregnable palace
To pick a timed lock To defeat armed

He tosses a purse on the table Heavy with gold

FREDERICK
He paid me for your lives Not my own

No Youre lying He is the king’s
own brother He wouldn’t-

FREDERICK

Of course he did After the princess
he’s next in line for the throne And
unlike her he’s got the muscle to
hold it End of story (beat) You will
find no shelter anywhere in this city
You can’t run and you can’t fight

going to cross them at the first opportunity Then

There’s another way

My master fearing a plot against his
life hired a merchant ship to smuggle
him out of the country It will sail
at sundown today with or without the
king

VIKING
You know the name of this ship

PAGEBOY

If you get me to the harbor I will
get you on it I’m not stupid If I
didn’t know a way out of the palace
you would have left me behind to die
The moment I tell you the ship’s name
I become useless You need me And I
need you So let’s keep it that way

Not that they have much choice in the matter So

KNIGHT
-»-All right You have my word (to
Gypsy) Can you get us to the docks

GYPSY
Seven miles on foot against the clock
and ten thousand men One helluva gamble

KNIGHT
Life’s a gamble Can you do it

Gypsy squats on the dirt floor draws a crude map of the city

GYPSY
We make our way to this bridge Cross
it in one piece if we’re lucky Get
to a cemetery over here

(MORE )

GYPSY(cont d)
Inside it is an entrance to the
catacombs My people use it for
smuggling From there the docks are a
mile maybe less Assuming we make it
that far Or the ship is still there
Or is even there in the first place

PAGEBOY
Just get me there on time And alive

Knight traces a more direct route

KNIGHT
Why not this way

GYPSY
Gang territories here and here Let’s
just say between them and Edward’s
army I prefer the army

They take it all in The map The obstacles The 1000 to 1 odds

KNIGHT
Wed better get moving

What about-

He motions toward the prisoners No one is looking forward to
it But they don’t have a choice Arab draws a knife

ARAB
Ill do it

Gypsy blocks his way Hand on his own dagger

GYPSY
No one touches him

FREDERICK
(relieved)
My nephew I knew you wouldn’t let-

GYPSY
Like you said we’re Roma We’re
blood And in my house that still
counts for something (beat) You’11
drink to my health won’t you uncle

He picks up the poisoned cup His blade pushes up against
Frederick’s neck Blood appears at the tip Frederick bellows

FREDERICK
You bastard Fuck y--

Gypsy forcibly pours wine down his throat Frederick
convulses as he literally drowns in his own poison

GYPSY
I know You’d think you were the
one who fucked my mother

Finally Frederick expires Gypsy tosses the goblet away in
disgust -- at his uncle at himself -- turns to Knight

GYPSY
The girl’s all yours

Knight nods Walks up to the prostitute Eerie calm

GIRL
I wont beg

KNIGHT
I know

He raises his sword Her eyes bore into his
An agonizing moment feels like an eternity Finally

KNIGHT
Go

He lowers the blade She searches his face Then

GIRL
For what’s worthI hope you make it

She takes a step and collapses Arab’s dagger in her back
On Knight If looks could kill the girl would have company

ARAB
She knew about the ship She knew
the route She sold you out once
She would have done so again

KNIGHT
You don’t know that

ARAB
Neither do you The difference is I
don’t gamble with other people’s
lives for the sake of my honor

KNIGHT
If we live through this

ARAB
If we live Like you said we’d
better get moving

EDWARD
Which people would those be

GREGORY
People who matter They wish to
know about the succession

EDWARD
Tell these people who think they
matter that I shall make an

Have them wait in the sun
preferably near the latrines I

We are in the middle of a crowded precession moving at a
snail’s pace across a long bridge spanning the local river
dotted with boats and barges Penitents and pilgrims compete
for right of way with drovers baggage trains and merchant
wagons Think rush hour on the Brooklyn Bridge

At the far end is the source of the bottleneck a checkpoint
manned by some forty SOLDIERS Oh-oh

Knight shuffles along a hood obscuring his features Pageboy
by his side eyes the looming roadblock visibly nervous The
rest of the crew are spread out ina loose semi-circle

KNIGHT
Stay calm Follow my lead If I say
jump you say-

PAGEBOY
How high

KNIGHT
No You keep your mouth shut and jump
like I told you to (beat) Scared

PAGEBOY
Aren’t you

KNIGHT
Has to end sometime Today is as
good a day as any
Pageboy gives him a look

KNIGHT
What

PAGEBOY
-Nothing It’s just right now
I wish I had your strength

KNIGHT
Don’t A man who isn’t scared of
dying has nothing to live for

Pageboy wants to say something else He never gets the chance

Mountain Men lope into view Spread out searching for their
prey They don’t bother with faces They go by scent

KNIGHT
Aghori(off Pageboy’s look) Savages
from the Hindu Kush mountains If it
goes bad don’t let them take you
alive They like their meat warm and
wet

Mountain Men close in crowd rippling as they gradually push
through toward our heroes inexorable unstoppable

Knight Arab A look between them Arab makes his way toward
a cart laden with spices Slits one of the sacks

Close on the tear leaking its contents into the breeze

We fly with the wind through and over the crowd until we
hit the nostrils of the closest Mountain Man The effect is
akin to that of cayenne pepper shoved into the nose of a
bloodhound He writhes in pain His buddies are next Eyes
watering Sinuses on fire The hunt grinds to a halt

Point for our guys They keep inching forward

Mountain Man Chief covers his face with a wet cloth yells at his
underlings in a harsh guttural tongue Strides toward our crew

Closer closer Pageboy trembles Knight puts a steading
hand on his shoulder And

Chief brushes past Hones in on the cart Inspects the cut
sack He knows

Slowly his eyes pan finally settling on our crew

He approaches Smells the spices on Arab Studies him like a
bug under a microscope Arab doesn’t flinch

Chief shifts his attention to Zulu Then Samurai Then
Knight And finally the boy

His gnarled finger topped with a long black talon-like nail
reaches for Page’s carotid artery Measures his heart rate It
BEATS rapidly like a rabbit flushed out of hiding

Chief grins opens his mouth

Nothing comes out Because Knight’s just driven a dagger into
his throat severing the vocal cords The other hand catches
the nail before it punctures the boy’s artery

They stand there locked in silent struggle Eyes burrowing
into one another The rest of the crew instantly tighten
around them blocking the view from the rest of the crowd
which keeps moving forward oblivious of the drama

Chief leans into the blade driving its bloody tip out of the
back of his neck Suddenly lunges for Knight’s face

Knight holds his ground Chief’s fangs snap an inch away

Knight twists the dagger The light in Chief’s eyes begins to
dim Except he knows something our hero doesn’t He pounces
again Not at Knight At Pageboy Who SCREAMS

It’s the scream of a woman

Heads turn people react surging away from the disturbance
leaving our heroes exposed Mountain Men lock onto them Onto
their dead leader A BATTLE CRY primal and chilling rips
from their collective mouths like an ancient curse

In response something RUMBLES in the distance SHAKING the
bridge No it’s not an earthquake or a T-Rex It’s the Teutons

Horses and riders 3000 lbs of armored mean THUNDER toward us
trampling the slow and the infirm Panic People shout shriek
stampede abandoning their possessions The checkpoint soldiers
charge from the other end struggling against the flood of

refugees And our guys are trapped right in the fucking middle

Knight grabs the terrified Pageboy Hell hath no fury
KNIGHT

He was after you He had your
scent He knew you were a woman

PAGEBOY
I
KNIGHT
No more lies We are all about to

die Because of you

PAGEBOY
-No Because of my father I am Amelia

Gypsy hears it knows On Knight It dawns

KNIGHT
The princess (fuck me) Not my day

And how right he is

Arab rapid fires at the Lead Teuton One two three shafts
ricochet off the black armor It’s like shooting at a Panzer tank
with a ‘45 They just keep coming enormous indestructible
the tremor rising rhythmically as they draw closer

Mountain Men scatter out of their way then follow to feast
on the survivors If there are any To Amelia

KNIGHT
Stay close

Samurai unsheathes his katana Steps forward sword held
high gleaming in the afternoon sun And

A split second before impact he whirls aside slashing at the
only exposed part of the Lead Teuton - his horse’s legs

BOOM both the rider and the beast become a pile of scrap
metal sparks flying as it cartwheels toward our crew

Monk jumps over the rolling wreck into a spectacular flying
kick aimed at the next Teuton only to bounce off

GYPSY
Fuck m

And then the three Teutons are upon them

Zulu SMASHES into the railing Viking barely blocks a war
hammer the blow so powerful it dislocates his shoulder

Knight hacks at a Teuton The rider pulls on the reigns the
house rears then CRASHES DOWN against Knight’s shield He
goes sprawling covering Amelia’s body with his own

Gypsy dives under a wagon loaded with barrels A Teuton RIPS
through it as if it was made out of matchsticks CRACK the axel
shatters dropping the thing on top of Gypsy

The tornado passes as swiftly as it descended

Knight climbs wobbly to his feet Blood welling from a cut
bisecting his brow Still his first thought

KNIGHT
You whole

AMELIA
I think

Knight doesn’t wait for her to finish Takes in the
situation Let’s see we got bad news and worse news

Bad news - our crew is mangled Worse news - the Teutons are

coming around for another pass They’ve also cleared the way

for the soldiers who are now following like infantry behind
tanks And as a cherry on top Mountain Men are approaching

from the other end Outlook--

VIKING
We’re dead

Gypsy is pinned under the wreckage Something drips from
above He tastes it

GYPSY
Rum

They have no time to think Only act

Viking ROARS SLAMS his shoulder against the wagon pops it
back in Grabs one of the barrels and THROWS

It flies toward the enemy in lazy slow motion
Zulu -- ribs cracked -- tracks hurls a spear

It is once again on target The steel tip of the projectile
sparks off the metal band of the barrel as it splits it open

KABOOM Medieval napalm

Soldiers on fire screaming dying breathing flames Horses
neigh buck careen out of control Two Teutons COLLIDE in a
spray of metal In a word “clusterfuck”

Zulu turns -- straight into a bolo flying toward him It
wraps around his legs felling him

A second later a Mountain Man cruelly curved blade in each
hand lands on top Zulu shifts steel digging into stone
The two roll away locked in a death grip

Knight passes Amelia to Viking

KNIGHT
Watch her
Rushes to help Zulu -- motion to the left ducks as a heavy
blade SINGS overhead -- spins to face--

The Lead Teuton Rising from the ground like a fucking
Terminator post the tanker explosion

Knight -- oh shit -- hacks once twice No effect Raises his
shield Teuton cleaves it in two

Sumo strides through the fray A heat seeking missile locked
on Amelia

Samurai rushes to intercept Sumo picks up a nearby Mountain Man
and tosses him at the opponent like a bowling ball Strike

Arab looses an arrow Sumo catches it offhandedly blink and
he’s right by Arab’s side stabs him with his own shaft
Keeps going A juggernaut

Viking -- last line of defence -- swings a sword Sumo
crushes the descending steel with his bare hand Swats Viking
out of the way hurling him fifteen feet away

Now it’s just him and the girl She holds out a small dagger

SUMO
Go ahead Take your best shot

She trembles and

Her hand is suddenly steady as she plunges the blade into
Sumo’s eye socket

Beat We wait for the Goliath to fall
He reaches for the dagger Pulls it out Gross

SUMO
My turn

His fist EXPLODES toward Amelia’s face with the force of a
freight train--

Grinds into Monk’s palm Looks medium rare But alive

MONK
Run

She does Sumo vs Monk Speed vs Power Bruce Lee vs Odd Job
Monk unleashes a volley of kicks and punches that would kill
any ordinary man Sumo shrugs them off Charges SLAMS Monk
against a parapet WHAM

Monk barely dodges a blow that spiderwebbs the stone chips
exploding like shrapnel Sumo rips out a chunk of masonry
HEAVES it Monk Iron Palms the thing shattering it into a
pollen cloud of dust Whiteout

When it clears a second later the space occupied by Sumo is
empty That’s because he’s already behind Monk

A chop brings our hero down to his knees Sumo towers over

SUMO
You are not the better man

He grabs Monk and throws him into the river

Gypsy soaked in rum strains to crawl from under the wreck

Zulu and Mountain Man grapple brutal primal hot breath
scorching each other’s faces Zulu bashes his opponent’s
knife hand against the pavement The blade flies loose
Mountain sinks his teeth into Zulu’s arm Zulu retaliates by
RIPPING out the guy’s nose ring

The fucker SHRIEKS plunges his other knife toward Zulu’s
throat Zulu holds it back tip hovering two inches above the
skin while strangling the Aghori with his bone necklace The
only question is who will kill the other first

Back to Amelia running a prey Here comes another hunter
CAMERA slingshots to the far side of the bridge where Bowman
stands alone tracking the princess Slowly as if he’s got
all the time in the world he draws--

Zulu sees it coming Pulls up his bolo-bound feet
Gypsyone more push almost got it

Bowman fires The shaft sails towards Amelia

Zulu catapults Mountain Man into the path of the arrow WHAM
it shishkabobbs him to the side of the rum wagon The added
weight almost crushes Gypsy Fuck

Amelia reacts -- Zulu just saved her life -- grabs the fallen
dagger saws through the bolo

Arab -- arrow through the shoulder -- ignores the pain
tracks the shot’s trajectory zeroes in on Bowman lets loose
four shafts in quick succession

Bowman -- a true marksman -- senses them coming shifts fires
Arrows collide mid-air tearing each other apart One two three-
The fourth slide by one another Arab’s shaft slicing

Bowman’s cheek the same instant his cuts Arab’s The two men

lock eyes sensing an equal The corners of Bowman’s mouth

curl upward ever so slightly

Knight backs away under the Teuton’s relentless barrage He’s
better and faster but the other guy is just an unstoppable
machine Knight throws it all in one desperate strike

His sword finally DENTS the armor and breaks in two

The Teuton -- probably grinning under that horned helmet --
readies the killing blow

Knight grabs the Teuton pushes him against the railing and
over it

They freefall still locked in furious combat as we plummet
with them and-

EXT UNDER WATER

WHAM SMASH into the river below

Teuton’s armor has now become his Achilles’ heel He sinks
fast Knight the lighter of the two swims for the surface

but the Teuton grabs him holds tight

A shadow passes overhead eclipsing the sun It’s a barge
gliding under the bridge

EXT BRIDGE

Bowman notches a black arrow an ominous looking vial attached
to its business end WHOOSH it arcs through the air--

Hits one of the rum barrels The vial shatters Chemicals
sizzle as they mix with alcohol Mountain Men smell it and
scatter rats fleeing the ship Even Sumo retreats

Arab -- whatever it is it ain’t good -- casts about frantic

The scorched Teutons are regrouping on one end Reinforcements
are arriving at the other Which leaves-

ARAB
The barge Now

He leaps over firing arrows as he goes Zulu grabs Amelia
follows Samurai is next Viking picks himself up about to bail--

Gypsy -- still trapped forgotten in the scuffle
GYPSY
HEY
Viking -- torn for a split second -- then runs toward the

wagon both men pushing with everything they’ve got The
barrel heats up quick chain reaction nearing critical mass

Gypsy finally wrenches loose tearing cloth and flesh dripping
rum like a wet dog They haul ass toward the edge as--

The barrel BLOWS SKY HIGH detonating the rest of the load with
it Makes the first explosion look like Jiffy Pop The shockwave
catches our duo tosses them into space Flames vomit in their
wake chase Gypsy’s vapor trail missing him by this much

They hit the water hard We glide under it toward-

EXT UNDER WATER

Knight still wrestles with the Teuton trying to pull away

Can’t Lungs screaming hands wrapped around each other as
they inexorably descend toward their doom

Knight rips off his opponent’s helmet recoils at the face
beneath Bald head no nose no ears just blue eyes and hate

He drives the helmet’s horn into the freakish features Blood
plumes Teuton clutches the wound Knight kicks off and up

EXT BARGE

Explodes out of the water gasping for breath Arab pulls him
up onto the deck The owner of the vessel a distant ancestor
to a Pakistani cab driver YELLS angrily in a language no one
can understand They are way past caring anyway

ARAB
You all right

Knight nods coughing water Notes the arrow through the shoulder

KNIGHT
Better than you

Wraps his hand around the shaft
ARAB
We are fucked as the day is long
are we not Crusader

Knight yanks out the arrow

KNIGHT
And then some

EXT BRIDGE

Bowman stands alone silhouetted against the raging inferno
Looks after Arab This isn’t over Not by a long shot

EXT BARGE

A hand grips the side of the boat Monk pulls himself over
collapses on deck more dead than alive The rest of the crew
are not far behind

ZULU
Now what

GYPSY
I dunno Ask Her Majesty

The others react Cat’s out of the bag

KNIGHT
This changes nothing The ship-

SAMURAI
How do you even know there is one
She’s lied about everything else

AMELIA
There’s a ship I swear My father
wanted me to leave the city To keep
me safe That is why I was wearing
these clothes when you found me

VIKING
Why didn’t you tell us

AMELIA
Would you

Point taken Still

GYPSY
They want her more than they want us
We can use that Buy our lives back
Maybe even with a little extra on top

AMELIA
Do you actually believe my uncle
will honor any deal he’s made with
you once he gets what he wants

Takes in their faces

AMELIA
You don’t trust me fine I don’t
trust you either I have no illusions
about what kind of men you are I
don’t expect you to give a damn about
my murdered father My people Or
myself for that matter But you still
need me And I need you

Before anyone has a chance to respond

GYPSY
Oh shit

They are headed toward another bridge bristling with
soldiers Some lower heavy chains and grappling hooks Others
ready a trebuchet Mountain Men and Teutons race along both
banks eager for Round Two Here we go again

AMELIA
They seem like sensible men I’m sure
they’1l be open to compromise

Gypsy shoots her a look summoning to mind the word that
women didn’t like even back in those days

KNIGHT
(to Viking)
Can you get us to the far shore
EXT SECOND BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS
Soldiers watch as the barge angles to the left

SERGEANT
Fire

EXT BARGE

A WHOOSHING sound getting louder fast A huge boulder is
coming straight at us like a fist of God

Amelia hits the deck Pure instinct And then she notices--
Everyone else remains standing

Slowly trembling she climbs to her feet Willing every
muscle of her body every ounce of her being to stand

upright Knight gives her the slightest of nods

WHAM the projectile slams into the river about two feet
off splashing H20 all over them

EXT SECOND BRIDGE
The trebuchet crew reloads

SERGEANT
Fire

EXT BARGE

The WHOOSH again and impact Fortunately it’s not from the
boulder Rather it’s the barge hitting the shore

Instantly they are over the side and onto the beach
scrambling like hell toward the city street level as-

WHAM the barge gets OBLITERATED behind them The owner
continues to yell We still can’t understand a word

EXT STREETSINT TENEMENTS - CONTINUOUS

And we are running Seven men and a young woman hunted by an
army of professional killers dash through the urban maze
The only way to stay alive is to keep moving Stop and you
die Handheld frenetic jarring “Black Hawk Down” time

Alley alley footsteps POUNDING behind turn the corner
Monk kicks open a door up the stairs corridor another
Mountain Men sniping at them through the windows poisoned
darts ricocheting all around

Dead end looms shit Viking -- berserker mode -- “Odin” --
BARRELS through the shoddy construction

Into the breach Arab’s last laying cover fire A blur of
sounds and lives people ducking SHOUTING cursing Mountain
Men moving fast down a parallel corridor a dog SNARLING
frothing at the mouth tearing at the leash to get to the
intruders It’s as if the entire world is against them

A pike stabs stabs through a wall Samurai stabs back the
wood bleeds Door Mountain Man behind it Zulu shoves him
face first into a boiling pot ruining someone’s lunch he
SCREAMS thrashes a fucking mess out left or right they
go left another door Monk senses a presence behind it
PUNCHES through no hesitation THUD he rushes in-

The world SLAMS on the breaks

That’s because the body on the floor is that of a young boy
Gasping Struggling to breathe through a crushed windpipe

Monk’s face His eyes And then--
REALITY RETURNS WITH A VENGEANCE

They react Monk grabs the child frantic at this moment
he’d do anything to save this stranger

SAMURAI
Come on

The boy looks at Monk trying to form words that never come
Blood seeps through the cloth Red on white Footfalls

SAMURAI
He’s gone Come on damn it

Mountain Man on the threshold Gypsy drops him at point blank
range SLAMS the door wedges it shut Blades rip through it
hungry for our heroes’ flesh

ARAB
Brother

Monk looks at him without seeing A thousand miles away

ARAB
We should go

Monk studies the blood on his hands Realizes he’s holding a
corpse It takes a supreme effort for him to let go

EXT COURTYARD —- DAY

They rush outside Multiple exits Sounds of pursuers closing
in

KNIGHT
Split up Meet at the cemetery one
hour before sundown (to Gypsy and
Amelia) You And you With me

No one needs to be told twice Zulu cuts one way Viking and
Samurai another Arab grabs the still catatonic Monk leads
him away We CRANE UP as they’re swallowed by the city

INT PALACE — DAY

War room Flags on the map denote the bridge the landing
area and the likely escape routs Edward studies it closely
a master chess player contemplating the next move

EDWARD
So she found herself an army

GREGORY
Seven men your Grace

EDWARD
Seven good men

GREGORY
Why would they divide their forces

EDWARD
They didn’t They divided mine
They’1l head for the gang territories

GREGORY
How can Your Grace be certain

EDWARD
Because that’s what My Grace would do

GREGORY
Then we needn’t worry Few venture
there None come out

EDWARD
Perhaps But I believe in being
thorough The weight of their heads
in gold Spread the word (beat) And
twice that for my beloved niece

EXT GANG TERRITORY - STREET - DAY

Two Mountain Men lead a platoon of heavily armed soldiers along
a deserted street Ominous silence promises nothing but trouble
If we started out in Manhattan this is the Bronx Pull up to
INT LOFT - DAY

Knight looks down at the passing troops Gypsy paces

GYPSY
We shouldn’t be here

KNIGHT
Enemy of my enemy

GYPSY
That doesn’t make them friends

KNIGHT
No But it might slow down ours

Gypsy shifts his attention to Amelia curled up in the
corner a scared rich girl

GYPSY
As long as she’s with us they can
track us Think she wouldn’t leave
you if the situation was reversed

KNIGHT
I gave her my word

GYPSY
What’s that worth Your life Mine
I won’t die for her Or your honor If
it comes to it I’1l do you both

AMELIA
Spoken like a true gypsy

Gypsy locks onto her Approaches slowly Every word every
syllable of the following bought and paid for in full

GYPSY
You ever been hungry princess And I
don’t mean ready for supper Ever
watch your loved ones die for lack of
a blanket or medicine or hope Ever
been beaten within an inch of your
life You don’t know a thing about me

AMELIA
I know you’re a thief and a murderer

GYPSY
That’s right I am Just like you
You and your kind kill and rob more
in a day than I will in a lifetime
The only difference is you do it from
a palace and with titles

AMELIA
That palace is a cage and my titles
are chains Besides today I have
neither Today I’m a fugitive
(MORE)

AMELIA(contd)
Just like you And if you ever
threaten me again I will kill you

Gypsy looks down The tip of Amelia’s dagger is pressed
against the crotch of his trousers He doesn’t flinch

GYPSY
Spoken like your father’s daughter

AMELIA
My father--

GYPSY
Was a fool who never gave a damn
about anything outside the walls of
his castle And now he’s dead
which makes him twice the fool
But you go ahead sweetheart You
can trim a few inches I got extra

She is flustered Then

KNIGHT
I know you can use a dagger What
do you know of swords

AMELIA
I know my father didn’t approve
of women using them

KNIGHT
Your father is gone

Knight tosses her a sword It digs into the floor pommel swaying

KNIGHT
Pick it up

Beat She pushes past Gypsy Pulls the blade out with some
difficulty raises it with one hand WHOOSH Knight’s sword
clears its scabbard disarming the girl in a flash

KNIGHT
Both hands

She picks up the weapon as he raises his -- a high guard

KNIGHT
Like this

She does her best to mimic Knight As he circles

KNIGHT
Left leg back Knees bent Killing a
mans more chess than brute force
It’s either you or him

(MORE )

KNIGHT (contd)
So you think ahead you play the odds
you create opportunity and when you
have the advantage you strike without
mercy and to kill (motions to her
neck and heart) Here and here

GYPSY
You’re wasting your time

AMELIA
(glancing at Gypsy)
And how will I know when to kill

He feints She swings His blade CLANGS against her’s sends
it straight up into the ceiling It hangs there

KNIGHT
You’1l know And when you do try to
hold onto the sword It helps Again

INT STREET - DAY
Teutons and soldiers clatter by We melt through the wall into-
INT SHOP - DAY

Small and empty save for Viking and Samurai The latter is a
kettle on slow boil Sliding katana from its scabbard

SAMURAI
I’m tired of running from these tin
men

Viking’s heavy hand lands atop his stopping it mid-draw

VIKING
You have nothing to live for I do I
will get to that ship I will see my
son again And I’1l be damned if I let
anything or anyone get in the way

SAMURAI
So you’d rather run like a coward
than fight like a man

VIKING
Yes

SAMURAI
Live out the rest of your days as
nothing less than nothing working
like a mule for a few meager coins
Pounding steel that other men use to
carve their names into eternity Grow
decrepid and old die in bed and turn
to dust as though you never existed
Is that what you want

VIKING
Yes

SAMURAI
Then I pity your son

VIKING
No You pity yourself You are no more
a Samurai than I What was your
father A farmer A blacksmith (off
Samurai’s reaction) This sword He was
the one who made it was he not

On Samurai Viking’s words need no confirmation For the
first time the cocky facade drops exposing the man beneath

He seems unarmed Scared Human Viking lets go

VIKING
We’re all running from something

SAMURAI
Yes And you keep running Like a
dog chasing its own tail I’m done

With that he strides out Viking looks after Then exits the
other way through the back door To each his own

EXT ROOFTOP - DAY

Arab kneels towards the Holy Places performing his midday
salat Lips move to the words only he and God can hear Monk
leans against the far wall staring into nothingness Then

MONK
What do you pray for

ARAB
For you For me For the boy For
those who died this day For those
who will die before it is over

MONK
Even if they deserved it

ARAB
They may have deserved to die But
they also deserve this After all
they must have believed in something
We all do Even the worst of us
Perhaps the worst most of all (beat)
You’re welcome to pray with me

MONK
Why To erase what I have done So
that God will forgive me

ARAB
No So that you will forgive yourself
God has already done so You should
know You wear the robes of his
servant

Monk takes in his clothes as if noticing them for the first time

MONK
Yes (beat) I have prayed As hard as
I could For as long as I could But
my God doesn’t answer Does yours

ARAB
No But I’m told he’s a very good

listener (beat) The boy You
couldn’t have known

Monk doesn’t respond When he finally speaks there’s a hint
of something in his voice glimpsed previously at the Buddhist
temple Something dangerous

MONK
I’m not talking about the boy

EXT ALLEY DAY

A figure leaps into frame It’s Zulu Running hard Breathing
harder

Beat Three Mountain Men cut in following his trail The
chase has been going on for hours and nobody is letting up

INT LOFT -— DAY

Blades strike

KNIGHT
Better

AMELIA
Why didn’t you kill that woman

KNIGHT
Did you want me to

AMELIA

(a confession)

Yes

KNIGHT
Why

AMELIA

Because I was afraid Because I want
to live Don’t you

KNIGHT
Depends on the price

AMELIA
When she was dead I feltrelieved
And ashamed (beat) I guess we all
have to do a little evil for the sake
of the greater good

A bittersweet smile creases Knight’s features

KNIGHT

I used to believe that too when I was
your age But then again I used to
believe a lot of things (beat) The
trouble with the end justifying the
means is that sometimes you get to the
end and wonder if it was worth it And
what it was all for

Thus concludes the lesson As he turns away

AMELIA

You didn’t answer my question
KNIGHT

Yes I did You just weren’t

listening

Shes about to say something else when his raised hand stops her
Gypsy tenses listening Two strides and he’s at the window

HIS POV Mountain Men and soldiers push through the front doors

GYPSY
We gotta go

INT BUILDING —- DAY

A warren of dark rooms and narrow corridors They rush for
the stairs Glimpse the hunters coming up from below

KNIGHT
The roof

INT STAIRWELL

Soldiers bound up the stairs Mountain Men in the lead
jacked up on adrenaline and bloodlust Suddenly they stop
Exchange glances Confused And afraid

The shadows seem to grow deeper A strange sound emanates
from above It sounds like wings

SERGEANT
Somebody light a fucking torch

One of his men does Wishes he hadnt

Because the walls are covered in graffiti -- weird primeval
nightmarish All of it drawn in blood

WHAM he is yanked upward into the black The torch falls on
the floor A moment later his headless corpse lands beside it

Steel boomerangs SWISH through the air refracting the torchlight
slicing off body parts cutting people in half Shapes more
animal than human glide overheard Two harpoons strike a soldier
from different directions Cables pull taut tearing him apart
Blood spatters adding a fresh coat of gore to the walls

It’s a massacre

The last Mountain Man races down the stairs HOWLS knee-
capped with arrows

He can barely make out the outlines of beaks and talons and
blood red eyes glowing in the darkness as they converge on him-

EXT ROOFTOP - DAY

His SCREAM washes over Knight as he puts his shoulder through the
door pushes onto the rooftop daylight stinging their eyes

GYPSY
You hear that

KNIGHT
No

GYPSY

Me neither

The roof is bare save for a single urn smoke wafting from its
top Knight races to the edge Sixty feet down at least thirty to
the next roof a flimsy bridge connecting the two buildings

AMELIA
Oh my God

A figure stands by the urn as if it just materialized out of
thin air Its head lolls to the side at an odd angle face
obscured by a feathered bird-like mask Its right hand topped
with long steel claws that would make Freddy Kruger jealous is
held over the flame heating up the blades The other wields a
wrist crossbow His name is TALON and he’s the leader of-

GYPSY
(fuck me)
Ravens

Talon raises his head His eyes covered by a mesh of ruby
red steel size up the intruders

Gypsy takes one uncertain step Another A HIGH PITCHED SHRIEK
emanates from behind Talon’s mask

GYPSY
RUN

EXT ROOFTOPS - CONTINUOUS - DAY

They do Dash from roof to roof via makeshift bridges built
out of planks and ropes Ravens everywhere behind to the
side even above airborne wraiths sliding along cables
strung overhead like an intricate spiderweb

Boomerang flies at a show stopping bullet time Knight pushes
Amelia aside the edge of the weapon slicing his shoulder as

it passes by Gypsy ducking under an inch to spare and it
just keeps going returning to its owner

And we are moving again A vertigo-inducing rollercoaster

Another roof A sheer drop with no exits Knight -- still mid-
stride chops down a pole with one blow It falls over the gap
they cross in a hurry don’t look down don’t look down

safe Gypsy chucks the pole into the abyss Ravens fire their
cable crossbows zipline over the chasm hardly skipping a beat

Several converge on Amelia A scythe is about to claim her
head Swing Knight blocks it but there are just too many--

She topples a cage A flock of pigeons flutter into the path
of the airborne assailants blinding them WHAM they
collide a mid-explosion of blood and feathers

When the view clears Amelia has vanished

Knight casts about no sign of her no choice but to keep
running they leap onto the roof of a church turn a corner--

Talon stands there Waiting Two dozen more Ravens encircle
our duo springing the trap

KNIGHT
Not my day

We do a 360 around Gypsy and Knight Back to back

GYPSY
I told you this was a bad idea didn’t
I Just like I told you she was going
to ditch us Just like I told you-

KNIGHT
Don’t worry I have a plan

GYPSY
Really

KNIGHT
No I’d just rather die without
listening to your whining

They brace themselves A WHISTLE cuts through the silence
like a firecracker Heads turn--

Amelia stands in the center on a giant stained glass ceiling
window covering the dome of the church For the first time
her auburn hair is down flowing freely in the wind For the
first time we glimpse something that wasn’t there before and
understand why Edward wants her dead so badly
AMELIA

I am Amelia of Aquilon Daughter to a

murdered king Rightful heir to the

throne of this land I am the one you

want (beat low) So come and get me

motherfuckers

Ravens consider One of them beelines for the girl Not to be
outdone his mates follow eager to claim the double bounty

She waits

They converge Cautiously step onto the glass It crackles
under the weight of many men but holds

She waits

Tiny spiderwebs shoot from under their feet spreading like a
virus turn back or press on greed wins closer closer

AMELIA
NOW

Knight hesitates he knows what he must do but--

AMELIA
DO IT

On Talon And then he knows it too He SHRIEKS RETREAT
Sprints for the edge as Knight locks eyes with Amelia and-
SMASHES THE GLASS

Chain reaction ripples along its surface POP POP POP
Hairline fractures turn into cracks Ravens might as well
flap their arms cause the whole thing SHATTERS and-
PLUMMETS

Talon and his bunch plummet with it in a mass trap door exit
Unfortunately so does Amelia

INT CHURCHEXT ROOF

Drops down fifteen feet And-

SNAP a rope tied to her waist pulls taut Good news - she’s
anchored herself to the roof Bad news - the rope rubs against

the jagged shards embedded in the frame fraying rapidly

AMELIA
Help

Knight -- Gypsy -- what to do -- Gypsy backs up centers
himself winding his body like a spring -- knives out and --
dives off the roof toward her

ROPE -- GONE -- she falls

He TACKLES her mid-air his momentum carrying them both toward

THE CHURCH WALL SMASH into it His daggers dig into the
limestone in a shower of sparks And-

Break the fall

They hang there Amelia’s hands wrapped around him Their bodies
pressed together Faces inches apart

GYPSY
I gotcha

She looks at him about to speak-

A familiar SHRIEK from below It’s Talon clinging to the same
wall with his steel claws And climbing toward them fast

GYPSY
A little help

But the roof is empty No sign of Knight

Back to our duo Gypsy can’t let go of the knives Amelia can’t
let go of Gypsy Talon powers toward them vengeance incarnate

AMELIA
Do something

Gypsy considers Plants his lips on hers
GYPSY
Now I can say I kissed a princess
before I died

AMELIA
I have no intention of dying today

And then Talon is on them Swings about to skewer both--

WHOOSH an arrow SPINS toward him spooling cable Hits his
clawed hand dead center nailing it to the wall Talon
SHRIEKS again this time in pain as-

Knight slides toward them An Angel of Death minus the wings
Relieves Talon of his mask And his head along with it

Eyes Amelia Seeing her as if for the first time Then
KNIGHT
We had a deal I have no intention
of breaking it Neither should you
You want to help Stay alive
AMELIA
Life’s a gamble right Besides I knew
youd keep me safe
GYPSY
Touching Better tell me the name of that
ship though In case you don’t make it

AMELIA
Then you’d better make sure I do

Knight chops the cable grabs Amelia Gypsy lets go off the
knives They swing across--

And land on the balcony on the other side
INT CHURCH - STAIRWELL

Our trio half sprint half fall down flights of stairs A
door looms Gypsy kicks it open and they’re in-

EXT STREET — DAY

A lone Raven mans the perimeter Sees the intruders And
runs like hell Gypsy gloats

GYPSY
Ravens Ravens Come out and play

He clucks like a chicken Beat Our Raven reappears And this
time he’s brought along about fifty of his friends

EXT STREETS - DAY

Our guys hauls ass down the alley and across the square a
wall of bodies behind them Knight hazards a glance back

Ravens have inexplicably stopped in their tracks Almost like
they’re unable to cross some imaginary line

AMELIA
Why aren’t they following us

Knight takes in the cheerful surroundings the brightly
painted shops the clean streets

KNIGHT
We’re out of their territory

GYPSY
And into whose

KNIGHT
Let’s hope we don’t find out

He starts walking Amelia’s hand stops Gypsy

AMELIA
What you said about my father
GYPSY
I was out of line
AMELIA
No You were right But we’re not
all like him and Edward Some of us
want peace If I were queen
GYPSY

--Well you’re not Today you’re a
fugitive (beat) Just like me

He pulls away heading after Knight Beat and she follows
As they press on into the unknown we drift back toward the
invisible border of the domain concluding our journey on

An exotic delicate flower nailed to a post like a marker
Blooming out of an eye socket of a Raven’s mask Off that

EXT RED LIGHT DISTRICT - DAY

PROSTITUTES entice men and their money from behind gilded
glass doors Samurai struts along taking in the offerings
unconcerned with pursuit unafraid of consequence

A beautiful young WOMAN a stylish mix of geisha and
courtesan East meets West catches his eye holds it He
angles towards her She blinks coy seductive

Samurai studies her for a beat She doesn’t waver He takes
the back of her head and kisses her passionate and hard

SAMURAI
How much

WOMAN
-The weight of your head in gold

It’s only now we see the same flower in her hair

The drug passed through the kiss hits Samurai like a ton of
bricks The walls shimmer then ripple then undulate Her
features twist into a macabre sneer

Samurai tries to draw his blade It tumbles to the ground
Its owner isn’t far behind Eyes open brain working but
limbs paralyzed -- a ketamine high gone bad

As we CRANE UP WOMEN part prostitutes part priestess --
young old but all somehow beautiful -- converge on his
fallen form This is a female gang known as the SIRENS

EXT FOUNTAIN - DAY

A bronze child pisses into a marble tub Zulu pulls his head
out of the water checks his six Mountain Men are fifty
yards out and closing

A deep breath and he’s off again going on fumes and desperation
EXT RED LIGHT DISTRICT - STREET —- DAY

CLOSE ON Samurai rattling down the street As we PULL BACK
we see that he’s propped up on an ox drawn cart his hands
chained to a beam rising out of the open cab A half dozen
Sirens are arrayed around the wagon They are unarmed

Suddenly the wagon lurches to a stop
Viking Axe in hand High fucking Noon

VIKING
No one has to die here today

An older Siren steps forward Her movements are elegant her
language precise her tone courteous and devoid of emotion

SIREN
Everyone dies son of Odin It is the
way of the world Before you do
answer me this Why are you willing to
sacrifice yourself for the sake of
this creature He’s violent Arrogant
Amoral His sole purpose is to fight
fornicate and feed He cares about
nothing He is nothing

VIKING
Yes

SIREN
Then why

VIKING

(beat)
Because I was like him once

Samurai doesn’t get it But the Siren does

SIREN
It has been a honor to meet you
Viking

She bows at the waist a demonstration of respect revealing-

A second Siren behind her blow gun at her lips WHOOSH
white powder shoots out Right into Viking’s eyes

An instant later his world fades to black He’s blind He
roars swings the axe-

At nothing Sirens circle taking their time a pack of wolves
about to rip into a wounded bear Weapons -- sais kusarigamas (a
sickle with chain topped with an iron ball) tekkos (filed
horseshoes used as knuckledusters) metal fans etc -- emerge

One rakes across Viking’s back Whirls away as his blade
strikes impotently at the now empty space Another takes a
chunks out of his side Shoulder Leg Death of a thousand cuts
Samurai watches All he can do is watch Or

SAMURAI
- Left

Viking hears realizes reacts all in one fluid motion -- his
axe arcs left finally finding flesh Siren SCREAMS drops dead

The others tense One pulls off her straw hat throws it WHOOSH

SAMURAI
Down
Viking ducks as the projectile -- razor sharp steel embedded in
its rim -- slices off the head of a Siren behind him A geyser

of red The survivors attack en masse

SAMURAI
Behind you

Viking drives the backspike into the face of one a short sword
sinks between his ribs fuck you he eats it for breakfast grabs
the blade lops off the arm holding it two left the Boss Siren
runs for the Samurai as he yells a coach calling plays

SAMURAI
Right high block hack

Viking executes the combo splitting the last Siren in two just
as the ring leader thrusts her sai into Samurai’s mouth

Since he can’t move a muscle he uses the only functioning part of
his body Namely he catches the flat of the blade with his teeth

A silent struggle as she presses the point into his throat He
holds it back literally clinging to life by the skin of his
teeth

Viking searches for Samurai’s voice knows he’s in trouble

VIKING
Show me your hands

With superhuman effort every fibre of his being straining
Samurai JANGLES his chains against the post

Viking locks on the sound Primes the axe Boss Siren sneers

SIREN
Pray to your gods you don’t miss
Norseman
On Viking
VIKING

Pray to yours
He throws the axe It sails through the air spinning end over
end as it PASSES THROUGH the Siren’s skull splattering
everything above her eyebrows And THWACK severs the chain

The Siren just sits there Unaware that she’s dead Finally
figures it out Falls off the wagon and onto the street THUMP

Viking rushes over Grabs Samurai in a fireman carry

SAMURAI
My swords

Viking fumbles for the blades with one hand shoves them into
Samurai’s belt and they’re moving A high pitched WARBLE washes
over them A dozen Sirens appear at the end of the street

VIKING
Do I want to know

SAMURAI
No You want to run

EXT STREETS - DAY

Speaking of running Zulu’s doing just that Stumbling is more
like it But being chased by three guys out to kill you and eat
you not necessarily in that order is one helluva incentive
He cuts down a narrow alley into-

EXT SLAVE MARKET

Remember the place we first met Zulu back on pg 6 Deja vu

The familiar DIN of the auction assaults his already frayed
senses strangers faces reactions indifference
curiosity confusion hate He’ll find no help here

He trips falls Doesn’t have the strength to get up This is
where it began This is where it’s going to end

His eyes drift across aimless unfocused settling on

The mangy tiger Lying on the floor of his filthy cage same
as before He appears to be dead Or close to it Once again
he and Zulu have something in common

Slowly almost on instinct Zulu wraps his hand around the tip of
the spear Blood seeps through his fingers drips onto dust

EXT ALLEY

Mountain Men are coming at a steady clip certain as death and
taxes They know they’ve got their quarry right where they want
him Which is why it comes as a mild shock when they see--

Zulu sprinting towards them blood trickling from slashed palm
throwing everything he’s got left into one final suicidal charge

They close on one another Ten yards out Nine Eight Sev-
Zulu drops to the ground revealing-

The liberated tiger mid-leap soars over his prostrated
form drawn by the scent of blood The luckless Mountain Men
have a split second to do a Wile E Coyote before-

The beast SMASHES into them faces ripped off limbs torn out
a lifetime of captive rage unleashed in one explosive instant

Zulu takes in the carnage Moves on as we PULL UP Zulu
getting smaller and smaller as we ascend to a bird’s eye view
of the area spotting Viking and Samurai with Sirens in hot
pursuit Drop down toward our duo

EXT STREET

Viking staggers forward blood pouring freely from half a dozen
wounds An archway looms ahead

SAMURAI
Put me down I can fight damn it

Viking leans against the arch staining the stone red
Samurai tries to regain his footing Takes a couple of baby
steps and falls Viking slides down beside him spent

VIKING
Well That didn’t quite work out the
way either one of us intended Ready

SAMURAI
You’re the hands I’m the eyes (beat)
You could have told me

VIKING
You could have told me

Silence Filled with things said and unsaid Then

SAMURAI
Next life

VIKING
Next life

ZULU (0S)
How about this one

Samurai grins

SAMURAI
Never figured I’d be glad to see
you again savage

ZULU
It’s nice to know you’re still an
ass Shall we

He grabs Samurai Viking climbs unsteadily to his feet holds
out his axe its tip moving from one side of the arch to the
other measuring distances he can no longer see

VIKING
No This is a good place I’11 hold
them You go

SAMURAI
Then I stay too

VIKING
To do what Bleed on them Dying is
easy boy Living day by day That’s
the hard part (to Zulu) Get him to
the cemetery friend

Zulu nods Lifts Samurai on his powerful back

ZULU
You still don’t know my name

VIKING
I still don’t need to (beat) If
you live find my son Tell him
that I Just tell him

Samurai tries to say something But all he can manage is-

SAMURAI
-Why

VIKING
When you become a father you’ll
understand Good bye Samurai

It’s the first time he’s called him that

Zulu’s off Viking stands alone Stands tall Waits for the
approaching Sirens ROARS swings the axe--

We don’t see its impact We stay on Samurai’s face as he
watches the battle from Zulu’s shoulders its receding SOUNDS
playing over his features Finally he closes his eyes BLACK

The inky darkness billows as though pulled by the wind Camera
pushes through it to find-

EXT ROOFTOP - DAY

Arab and Monk crouch under a black awning rippling under a
light breeze Arab surveys the area with his spyglass

ARAB
Less than a mile to the cemetery

The good news is lost on his travel companion Arab folds the
instrument glances at the position of the sun

ARAB
We should go Monk

He strides for the exit Notices the latter isn’t following

ARAB
Monk

Monk explodes His calm dignified facade is ripped off
discarded like a mask at the end of Carnival

MONK
You think you know everything don’t
you That you have all the answers
That you can pray away your sins
That I’m a servant of God That I am
a good man

His secret His demons All laid bare before us

MONK
I am no monk I killed the man who
wore these robes Just as I have
killed others beyond count Men
Women Children like that boy
today even younger I have raped
(MORE )

MONK (cont d)
I have tortured I have cut babies
from their mother’s wombs I have
slaughtered starved pillaged and
burnt entire villages to terrify
others into submission I ama
monster I am a plague I am the
Devil Even my own generals turned
against me because they knew that
someday I would destroy them too
That’s why I am here Dressed in
these clothes Pretending to be
something I am not

On Arab as the enormity of the confession sinks in

MONK
Come on Say something Tell me
there’s good in all of us Tell me
there’s a God Tell me

Arab turns Monk grabs him -- Arab spins gunslinger quick
bow drawn aims at Monk and fires in one fluid motion

The arrow WHISTLES -- hits the man behind Monk -- a massive
armored Highlander in full blue battle paint Braveheart on
steroids a claymore raised high above his head

He topples except he was just the decoy Another pair have
snuck up on them fast soundless and Arab realizes it just
a second too late as one of them swings a mace--

And THUMP Another shaft BULLSEYES the Scottsman mid-strike
splatters him against the wall The second drops his partner
PUNCHING through the shield and the man

Arab -- one glance at the fletching on the arrow and he
knows who it is Eyes snap to adjacent rooftops To Monk

ARAB
Go Go damn it
Monk -- still reeling from it all -- Arab shoves him toward

the door rolls as a third shaft sails by cutting through
the space he inhabited a quarter second ago

He comes up in a crouch his own arrow notched retaliates

WHOOSH it cuts through the air -- and THUMP splits the wood
inches feet away from Bowman’s face

Bowman smiles at the attempt Watches Arab’s rooftop ina
small mirror mounted on a nearby wall Sniper vs Sniper

Back to Arab as he peeks cautiously over the railing trying
figure out if he got the shooter Since no more arrows are
coming it would appear to be the case On the other hand

to

Bowman -- arrow primed -- just waiting patiently for Arab to
rise from behind the cover

Arab doesn’t fall for it Gets comfortable Or at least tries to
EXT ALLEY - DAY

Monk alone adrift moves without purpose A dozen yards ahead
Sumo steps out of an alcove Skin burned a rough bandage over
one eye he is as imposing as before only uglier

Monk doesn’t seem to notice or care Just keeps coming

Sumo swings a fist Monk doesn’t block or dodge WHAM it
knock him flat on his back

Slowly he gets up WHAM Take two Sumo’s frustrated

SUMO
Fight me

MONK
No

It’s unclear if he’s addressing Sumo or himself Up again WHAM

SUMO
Fight me damn it

MONK
(grits his teeth)
No

He staggers upward Sumo strikes again-

Right into Monk’s counterstrike Fist against fist Energy
ripples up Sumo’s arm shattering bone Sumo HOWLS in pain

And then Monk looks up for first time since the start of the
confrontation and we realize that there’s something starkly
different about him Maybe because he’s not Monk anymore

He cracks his neck Stands a little taller Smiles through
bloody teeth It’s a razor thin smirk more scythe than a
smile that never reaches his eyes Jekyll and Hyde time

MONK
You should have listened

He doesn’t fight Sumo He takes him apart

A pressure point hit to a Golgi tendon on the back of an
elbow triggers a reflex which immediately relaxes the muscle
allowing the joint to bend more easily in the wrong
direction CRACK Sumo’s left arm is history

Side of the knee is next CRACK the big man crumbles A blow
just below the occipital ridge Concussion

Desperate defenceless Sumo tries to crawl away Monk casually
kicks him in the side targeting floating ribs CRUNCH Red
marks the point of impact Again Again And again

Sumo vomits blood Monk’s had enough fun wraps his prayer
beads around Sumo’s throat Pulls them tight like a garrote

Sumo Eye bulging Lips turning blue It’s not pretty

Monk -- or rather whatever the thing that was pretending to
be Monk hiding inside him until now -- watches Sumo die He

likes to watch And then

His eyes focus on the prayer beads The symbol of faith
turned into an instrument of destruction

Slowly his expression changes to that of disgust At what
he’s about to do At what he was and has once again become
At the chilling realization that he’s more of a monster than
the man whose life he is about to claim He lets go

Sumo collapses Wheezing Whimpering A stone cold killer
reduced to a terrified child

Monk -- for he’s that once again -- leans down Softly
MONK
You were right I am not the better
man (beat) But you could be

He hands him the prayer beads And walks away

On Sumo as he watches him go Holding the offering Wondering
why he was spared Wondering what to do next Wondering

EXT ROOFTOPS - DAY
Sun White hot Beats down without mercy

Arab lies flat on his back with no shade to shield him from
its punishment His eyes shift to the only available exit

The door leading to the stairs and the street below About
twenty feet away Might as well be a thousand Meanwhile

Bowman is chillin’ comfortably in the shade sipping water
from a canteen waiting for the other guy to make a move All
the time in the world

Arab doesn’t have that luxury A glance at the sun confirms
what he already knows for him time is running out And with
it hope

Arab’s gaze shifts toward the corpse of the Highlander Then
his partners dropped by Bowman A thought forming

EXT ROOFTOPS - A FEW MINUTES LATER
Bowman spies Arab poking his head into view Gotcha

WHOOSH an instant later his shaft SHEERS the top of Arab’s
head The body THUDS on the roof as we swivel around it--

It’s a dead Scottsman wearing Arab’s clothes Arab crouches
beside it waiting for Bowman to confirm the kill

Back to Bowman That was too easy Reaches for his quiver
Another special arrow Pulls the cover off its head

revealing a razor sharp six point tip

Arab waits his own arrow primed

THWACK THWACK THWACK THWACK THWACK Five shafts ERUPT through
the stone at regularly spaced intervals 14th century armor
piercing rounds each closer and closer to their intended target
Arab -- fuck me Only one option left

He runs for the door sprinting like hell zig-zaging making

it utterly impossible for anyone to draw a bead on him He’s
only a couple of feet away from the exit when-

Bowman’s shaft strikes him between the shoulder blades knocking
him against the very door he was trying so desperately to reach

Arab falls face down DISSOLVE TO

EXT ROOFTOP - A FEW MINUTES LATER

Bowman steps out on the roof One slight problem

Arab’s body has vanished Left in its place are three sets of
chest plate armor courtesy of the slain Highlanders
Medieval bulletproof vests Bowman’s armor piercing arrow has
cut through two of them pushing into the third

On Bowman as we hear-

He takes a deep breath Think think

EDWARD
The only reason that bitch isn’t dead
is because they are protecting her
Which means she’s promised them
something in return

GREGORY
Amnesty Money

EDWARD
No If they wanted either they would
have knocked on my door hours ago The
man who leads them He’s smart So it
has to be something tangible
Something worth risking his life for

GREGORY
A way out

Precisely Land or sea

GREGORY
They are closer to the harbor But as
your Grace is aware we have a thousand
men blocking every street from here

Which means he knows it too Unless-

He stares at the map You can practically hear the gears turning

are not about to acknowledge it not now not ever

-Alive last I saw him

AMELIA
Do we wait for him

Knight shakes his head To Gypsy

KNIGHT
Lead the way

They drift through the cemetery marathon runners nearing the
final leg Amelia sidelines Knight

AMELIA
You just left a man behind to die

KNIGHT
Yes

AMELIA
What if it was you Or me Someone
you loved Or are you even capable
of that Is getting on that ship
all you care about

KNIGHT
Do you

AMELIA
As long as Edward lives he’1ll never
let me rule So I don’t have a choice

KNIGHT
Yes You do I’ve made a lot of them
All bad ones as it turned out And
then one morning you wake up and
realize you don’t have many left and
that the road before you is shorter
than the road behind So Ill get on
that ship And if that man is still
alive by the time we sail I will kill
him drink to his memory and live to
lose another day And I will lose I
always lose That is my future But it
doesn’t have to be yours

AMELIA
What you’re asking me to do--

KNIGHT
I ask nothing I simply remind you
that the only thing necessary for
the triumph of evil is that good
men stand by and do nothing

Amelia gives him the same look he gave her at the church
Seeing him as if for the first time

They crest a small hillock And stop

Because the entrance to the catacombs is blocked Not by
soldiers or by gangs but by people too poor to live
anywhere else Young Old Men Women Children Some
crippled Some stricken All hungry and desperate

A MAN steps forward

MAN
We mean you no harm

KNIGHT
Then you’ll let us pass

MAN
Yes All we ask is that you let us
have one

KNIGHT
One what friend

MAN
One of you

They instantly tighten their ranks

MAN
Please understand We have sick Good
people dying of hunger Children whose
only crime was being born here The
bounty for just one of you can save
their lives

Knight sizes up the opposition A few carry weapons ranging from
sticks to stones but most are unarmed and in no shape to fight

KNIGHT
You their leader

MAN
I’m just a man out front Sometimes
others follow As your people appear
to follow you

KNIGHT
Then tell your people to step
aside Or we will go through them

MAN
I have no doubt you are fully capable
of doing so But dying by your hand is
preferable to the alternative I wish
there was any other way

KNIGHT
As do I

The mob advances Frantic

GYPSY
What do we do

KNIGHT
Try to wound them if you can If not

AMELIA
They are unarmed for God’s sake

KNIGHT
Then they should have armed
themselves Or stayed out of our way
SAMURAI
Youre right It’s either them or
us And you know who made them this

way Men with swords Men like you
And now men like me

MONK (0S)
Wait

No Only for myself

He gently frees himself from her grip

Because when I was you I didn’t either

Edward’s gaze pans off the prisoner locking on a nearby
building smoke billowing from its stacks To his Captain

EDWARD
That would be a tannery
CAPTAIN
Yes Your Grace
EDWARD
-Flood the tunnels with oil
CAPTAIN
But sir Our own men are down there

And that could burn this entire
section of the city to the ground

It was a good try Thank you
Please say something

I am afraid

AMELIA
I thought you were never afraid

A man who isn’t scared of dying has
nothing to live for (beat) I do

Finally the armor cracks exposing the man beneath The
daughter he never had The father he will never be He
struggles to say something But for once he’s at a loss

She takes his hand places it on the pummel of his sword
Smiles through the tears A confession of her own

RIDERS First heard then seen coming fast Soldiers stationed
at the docks charge from the other end This isn’t over

KNIGHT
Go

The final fifty yard dash Samurai pushes aside a deckhand
chops at the anchor splitting the thick rope

EXT SHIP - SUNSET
Amelia and Gypsy leap on board Captain takes one look

CAPTAIN
I don’t want no trouble

AMELIA
Then get this damn boat moving

Captain snaps at the familiar voice barks a command

EXT HARBOR - SUNSET

The vessel groans into motion Knight Arab Zulu and Samurai
run parallel helping to push it off fending off soldiers
keeping them off the ship off the princess off one another
For once they fight as a single unit As a team

Zulu jumps on board Then Samurai Then Arab Then Knight--
An arrow clips him mid-jump

Bowman -- five hundred yards out -- notches the second shaft
Knight staggers up keeps going Riders on his heels

Arab -- Bowman or riders -- riders it is Drops one two three-

Knight takes it up a notch -- 10 yards out 8 6 -- running
out of dock but he can still make it he will he must

Gypsy at the stern held by Zulu and Samurai reaches out to
him shouting at the top of his lungs

GYPSY
COME ON COME ON

And everyone else is shouting too willing him to press on
wanting to give him their strength Amelia’s calling out to him
pleading Only Arab is silent as he kills everyone behind
Knight draw aim release draw aim release a blur of death
Knight’s fingers touch Gypsy’s Entwine “The Defiant Ones”

Bowman’s shaft hits Knight in the leg He stumbles falls
Gets dragged behind by Gypsy Their hands come apart

A beat later the boat is too far And Mountain Men too close

Knight knows what will happen if they take him alive Looks
at Amelia for the last time Then his eyes meet Arab’s

He nods
Beat Arab fires his arrow into Knight’s heart
Amelia Her anguish Her silent scream

The others Frozen Shocked Only Arab moves Having
fulfilled his promise he slides against the railing

The ship glides into the open sea toward the dying sun

EXT HARBOR - SUNSET

Mountain Men fight over Knight’s meager possessions like
vultures One of them kneels next to the body knife out
Edward’s boot catches him in the face knocks him back

EDWARD
He was a soldier Bury him like one

Edward shifts his gaze to the receding boat Gregory sidelines

GREGORY
A war ship Your Grace

EDWARD
-No She’s fast and the wind is
in their favor Pity Let’s go

GREGORY
Where

EDWARD
To the palace of course To claim my
rightful place on the throne And prey
for a storm a pirate or a giant fish

GREGORY
Shell turn to your brother’s allies
Try to raise an army

EDWARD
No doubt She’1l be back Except
next time we meet I’1l have a
crown on my head and loyal
subjects eager to defend it
against a foreign invader The key
to being a good general isn’t
winning battles It’s not losing
wars And this one is over

INT PALACE —- COUNCIL CHAMBERS - EVENING

The city’s power elite -- landowners merchants priests and
aristocrats -- simmer in frustration Edward glides in
EDWARD

A thousand pardons my friends I
trust you’ve not been waiting long

NOBLEMAN
We have As I’m sure was your
intent So let’s dispense with this
charade We all know Amelia is the
rightful heir
Reactions

EDWARD
Indeed Feisty girl Beloved by her
people Would have made a fine
queen I’m sure Pity she’s dead

This is news to everyone

EDWARD
Oh You haven’t heard Cut down in
her prime by the same men who
murdered my brother I saw her body
with my own eyes

BISHOP
And the assassins-

EDWARD
Killed while resisting arrest

NOBLEMAN
How convenient I suppose we’1ll
never know who hired them

EDWARD
You already know who hired them Me

Stunned silence Edward doesn’t bat an eye

EDWARD
That’s what all of you are thinking
Or are we still playing charades

MERCHANT
You are next in line for the throne

EDWARD
Who says I want it Seems to me that
being king is something of an
unhealthy occupation these days I’m
but a simple soldier I know how to
fight and how to fuck So I leave
the burdens of the crown in your
capable hands gentlemen

BISHOP
You mean-

EDWARD
I mean I intend to bury my brother
and my niece and be on my way I’m
tired I want peace Retire to the
country perhaps Plow my fields Bed
my women Besides people grow
restless without a leader There will
be riots Looting Maybe civil war

94

EDWARD (contd)
Third cousins slitting each other’s
throats over the spoils Honorable
men like yourselves turning against
one another Messy unpleasant stuff

They eye one another divided suspicious each believing the
others to be capable of exactly that

EDWARD
Any road I’m sure you’1ll manage

He strolls toward the exit

NOBLEMAN (0S)
Wait

Edward permits himself a small smile
EDWARD

Wait For what You just accused me
of killing my own flesh and blood

NOBLEMAN
Nonsense We were merely suggesting-

EDWARD
That it would be in my interest to
posses the throne You’re wrong It
is in yours

All eyes on him as he goes around the room

EDWARD
Church Docks Textiles Banking
Construction Your fortunes -- all of
your fortunes -- are tied directly to
the health of this house And without
a head it is anything but healthy

MERCHANT
What do you want from us

EDWARD
Only that you search your hearts
And ask what is best for the good
people of this city

We drift along the faces of the council until we find-

LAWYER
I propose that Edward take his
rightful place on the throne

Speak of the Devil An aye Another Then a roar of AYES
Edward’s grin should be on the cover of Shit Eaters Monthly
A magnificent bastard

EDWARD
Shall we say dawn tomorrow

EXT BOAT -— EVENING

No one says anything Because they are too drained And in
too much pain Silence Gypsy is the first to break it

GYPSY
Wine

A crewman hands him a jug He guzzles Passes it to Arab

GYPSY
Drink

ARAB
My faith-

GYPSY

You could kill him You can drink
to his memory

Beat Arab accepts the offering A long pull
Zulu’s turn Then Samurai Finally Amelia completing the circle
She raises the jug to her lips Stops

AMELIA
Icannot

WHAM she smashes the jug against the deck Wine splatters
the boards like blood To the Captain

AMELIA
Take me back to the city Then deliver
these men wherever they wish to go

Gypsy explodes the enormity of everything they’ve been
through in the last 24 hours finally catching up

GYPSY
You stupid selfish bitch He died for
you So you can live And now you’re

going to throw it all away For what
For power For revenge For pride

AMELIA
No For him For my people For those
who died here today For the same
reason he didn’t kill that woman
Because there are some things you
cannot do even if you know you must
Because the price is too high

She takes in these hard desperate men Speaking to all and

AMELIA

What do you think will happen once
Edward assumes the throne How many
more will die Hundreds Thousands
(beat) I’m a coward You know why
Because I’m not brave enough to walk
away Because I’m scared that years
from now I would trade all that I have
and more for the chance to go back to
this day This moment And make a

different choice
We hold on their faces Wait for answers

GYPSY

You know what’1l happen years from now
No one will care that we ran or that
you stayed No one will even remember

Turns to the rest of the crew

GYPSY
Time to see the world

ARAB
I’ve seen it

He staggers to his feet Picks up his bow

ARAB
I have unfinished business

SAMURAI
As do I

Picks up his swords Takes his place beside Amelia and

No It’s just you

GYPSY
What are you going to do fight for
the same people that put you in chains
and treated you like cattle This is
freedom This is what you wanted
ZULU
Yes But not like this A slave would
run A free man would choose to stay
Picks up his spear Joins the rest

Gypsy stands alone Looks at Amelia He can’t believe it
Won’t Stupid so fucking stupid Bites into every word

GYPSY
Idiots God Damn You All (beat)
And me along with you
They stare at him surprised Impressed even All business
GYPSY
Shut the fuck up We need a plan
What’s the ship’s cargo

AMELIA
I was hoping you’d ask

The sails billow powered by strong ocean breeze Letters
appear on them and flutter away gone with the wind

CHAPTER V THE RETURN
EXT PALACE - DAWN
Sun peeks cautiously over the horizon
INT PALACE —- DAWN
Edward stands naked arms outstretched Christ sans the cross
BISHOP
Have you invoked God’s name over
the course of this night my son

A pair of naked women lie in rumpled sheets at his feet

EDWARD
Repeatedly

Consecrated oil pours on his head
INT ELSEWHERE - SAME TIME

Gypsy pours tar on a small burlap sack coating its exterior

INT PALACE —- DAWN

Lavish imperial robes are placed on Edward’s body

INT ELSEWHERE - SAME TIME

Amelia puts chain mail over hers

INT CATHEDRAL - DAWN

A cleric tests the string on a harp

INT ELSEWHERE - SAME TIME

Arab affixes a fresh string to his bow

INT PALACE —- DAWN

A royal scepter gleaming with jewels is being polished

INT ELSEWHERE - SAME TIME

Samurai’s katana as the wetting stone glides along its edge
INT CATHEDRAL - DAWN

Bells TOLL announcing the impending coronation

EXT ELSEWHERE - SAME TIME

Zulu DRIVES a spike into wood

INT CATHEDRAL - DAWN

Giant doors part revealing a breathtaking space filled with
the city power elite we met during the council session as
well as a gallery of commoners

Edward strides in Man of the hour Bishop waits at the end
of the aisle Edward kneels before him Pause Then

BISHOP
Let us begin

EXT ROYAL DOCKS —- DAWN

A bored guard stands vigil in the watch tower Scratches his
balls Glances at the ocean Double-takes

A ship is coming out of the sun strong morning breeze powering
her unfurled sails Amelia’s crest flies proudly on the mast

Guard blanches Sounds the alarm At least tries to

The ringing of his bell is drowned by those atop the cathedral

The ship grows bigger and bigger as it barrels toward--

Guard -- fuck it they don’t pay him enough for this --

Runs as behind him the behemoth RAMS the docks destroys --
nay OBLITERATS the watch tower the pier and everything else
that stands between it and the sea wall

EXT SEA WALL - DAWN

Soldiers react raising weapons There’s just one tiny problem--

EXT SHIP’S DECK

There’s no one at the wheel It’s anchored to the deck fixed
on a precise course

The beast keeps coming A juggernaut Forty yards from the
sea wall Thirty Twenty

INT CATHEDRAL - DAWN

Bishop recites some fitting Latin benediction Choir sings
Edward and Co are blissfully unaware

EXT SEA WALL - DAWN

CRASH the mangled ship PLOWS into it wood buckling bow
compressing finally grinding to a halt as--

Our five -- Amelia Gypsy Zulu Arab and Samurai -- leap
from the deck race along the wall as soldiers converge

INT SHIP’S CARGO HOLD - SAME TIME
We finally see the ship’s cargo
GUNPOWDER The fuses are lit and burning white hot KA-

EXT SEA WALL

Makes a rather sizeable hole in the world Shrapnel SHREDS
everything in general vicinity The ship is rendered to tinder
the wall to dust Our heroes tumble down steps as stairs and
pursuing soldiers disappear behind them erased by the explosion

INT CATHEDRAL

Shockwave SHATTERS stained glass windows Edward heard that
Mutters the name like a curse

EDWARD
Amelia

The natives get restless Edward tries to reclaim the spotlight

EDWARD
Everyone remain calm The same
assassins who murdered my beloved
brother and niece are now trying to
stop me from claiming the throne My
men will deal with them (to his
Captain) Bar the doors Don’t let
anyone in or out

BISHOP
Perhaps we should postpone until-

EDWARD
(low)
Keep going or I will rip your fucking
heart out
Bishop instantly presses on with the ceremony

EXT PALACE - OUTER COURT —- DAWN

Our crew keep going full tilt into the courtyard -- about
fifty soldiers there still reeling from the shock and awe of
the explosion -- through them knife and butter rush inside

Samurai peels off Faces the horde Hand hovering by the pommel
of his sword a gunslinger ready to draw

He does

SWISH SLASH SWISH SWISH SLASH Five men die where they stood
frozen for one brief moment before collapsing to the ground

45 soldiers stop dead in their tracks Eyes like saucers
Samurai surveys the opposition Zeroes in on one

SAMURAI
You You’re next

Edwards finest gulps

INT PALACE -—- HALLWAY - DAWN

And we are back with our crew running down a long hallway
A CLATTER of hooves echo ahead The three remaining Teutons
RUMBLE towards them like Panzer tanks at Stalingrad
Distance between them vanishing fast

Gypsy -- still on the move -- tar-coated sack out throws it

It hits the lead Teutons Sticks Arab and Zulu throw theirs
Same effect

Both the audience and the charging Teutons have a moment to
ponder what the-

KABOOM Remember the sticky bombs from “Saving Private Ryan

Gypsy’s Teton is blown off his horse concussive force
pulverizing him inside the steel exoskeleton KABOOM KABOOM
Adolf and Fritz join him in the afterlife

And our foursome just sprint through never skipping a beat
INT PALACE - FOYER - DAWN

Large foyer looms ahead Arab senses spins shoots WHOOSH
an arrow intended for Amelia gets knocked off course

Bowman -- second floor -- rapid fires another

Arab fires lightening quick -- who’s better -- dead even
WHOOSH WHOOSH WHOOSH WHOOSH shafts splinter as Amelia
Zulu and Gypsy run through the crossfire fragments raining
harmlessly on their heads

And they’re out Bowman and Arab instantly shift their aim on
one another dodging and sniping at the same time mirroring
each other’s moves a dance of death a duel of masters

INT CATHEDRAL
Bishop extends a golden chalice to Edward’s lips

BISHOP
Do you swear by the blood of Christ
to uphold the laws of this land

EDWARD
I do

He drinks Sacramental wine stains his robes
EXT COURTYARD

A geyser of gore Lone Wolf And Cub style as Samurai
dispatches another soldier Outnumbered forty to one fighting
a 360 degree battle covered in blood other men’s and his
own A wound disables his right arm He tosses the sword into
his left annihilates one two three four Maybe he isn’t
the greatest swordsman who ever lived but then again

INT FOYER
Arab and Bowman weave through pillars like wraiths each

unable to find an opening in the other’s defence Arab
reaches for his quiver only a few arrows left

INT CORRIDOR

The trio turn a corner -- straight into a fusillade of
crossbow bolts Zulu shoves Gypsy aside shields Amelia’s
body with his own PHUM PHUM PHUM takes the worst of it
Five soldiers at the end reloading

Zulu staggers but doesn’t go down keeps running

They work faster

He charges toward them ROARING Hurls a spear It PLOWS
through one guy nails the second

Three left Hastily crank their bowstrings One fires--

The bolt hits Zulu point blank but he’s unstoppable
unleashed fury of all oppressed personified in one man

BASHES a head against the wall SNAPS a neck Finally rips a
bolt out of his own body and stabs the last soldier under the
chin and into the brain

It’s over But Zulu still refuses to go down

Looks at Amelia Marks her with his own blood Simply

ZULU
Make it right

All she can do is nod And keep going
His body finally buckles He sinks into one of the thrones of
great kings of old lining the length of the corridor Sits
there an echo of Conan frozen fearsome even near death
INT CATHEDRAL
Bishop readies the Host

BISHOP

Do you swear by the body of Christ
to be merciful and just

EDWARD
I do
EXT COURT YARD
Corpses litter the courtyard Soldiers -- or rather what’s
left of them -- surround Samurai He rests on his feet a

boxer after 11 rounds waiting for them to attack

A sword lands at his feet Another More A pile of discarded
steel like a monument to his skill One question

SOLDIER
Who are you

Samurai flicks the blood off the blade Slides it back into
the scabbard The moment he’s been waiting for

SAMURAI
Nobody

INT FOYER

Arab looses an arrow Only one left

Bowman whirls behind the pillar He’s been counting And he’s got
another quiver strapped to his back Fucker comes prepared He
can’t outshoot our guy So he is going to outlast him

Arab -- it’s now or never And then he does something odd He
RIPS the fletching from one side of his last shaft Notches

it Takes a deep breath And steps out into the open

ARAB
Finish it

Bowman has a clear shot Still he waits cautious
Arab aims to Bowman’s right Clearly off target

ARAB
Finish it Or are you afraid

Bowman -- prudence vs pride -- pride wins -- he pops out
fires at Arab who fires at the same instant

Bowman’s shaft sings through the air Dead on target
Arab’s arcs an obvious miss

Bowman’s eyes track it The corners of his lips curl upward
ever so slightly

His shaft strikes Arab square in the chest just as-

Arab’s arrow curves sweeping left around pillars -- an
amazing trick shot -- THWACK piercing Bowman’s neck

Both men go down
INT CATHEDRAL
BISHOP
Do you swear by the name of Christ to

wear this crown as his loyal servant

EDWARD
I do

INT CATHEDRAL - OUTER CHAMBER
Amelia and Gypsy rush toward the doors Gregory blocks their path

GREGORY
Wait

Gypsy swings his sword Gregory raises his hands unarmed
crucifix in one key in the other

GREGORY
Youll need this

Holds out the key as a peace offering

AMELIA
Why

GREGORY
If you die no one will know If you
live you’ll remember I’m not a
monster Princess I only serve one

Gypsy lowers his sword Grabs the key turns--

Gregory slides a dagger out of his crucifix Stabs Gypsy in the
back rattle snake fast Slashes at Amelia opening a cut on her
cheek She cries out retreats

Gregory reclaims the key

GREGORY
That said there’s a far greater
chance you’ll fail And the reward
from my master will be far greater
than one I would receive from you

Gypsy -- on the floor bleeding -- reaches for his sword
Tries to get up Can’t

Gregory advances on Amelia Slash Slash Slash She dodges
barely Her palm gets sliced open She bites off a scream

GREGORY
I have no stomach for violence and
you have no tolerance for pain It
would be easier for both of us if you
simply accepted the inevitable

Gypsy gathers whatever strength he has left Pushes his
sword toward Amelia It skitters across the floor

She snatches it holds it best she can She might as well be
wielding a feather duster Gregory cocks an eyebrow

GREGORY
Your father would not have approved
Do you even know where to put that

WHAM she parries lunges nails him straight through the
windpipe Just like Knight showed her Then into his heart

AMELIA
Here and here

Off Gregory’s genuine puzzlement

AMELIA
I had a good teacher

Gregory dies She relieves him of the key Leans over Gypsy

AMELIA
Are you with me

He clasps her hand Their blood mixes

GYPSY
To the end

She helps him to his feet They limp onward together
INT CATHEDRAL
Bishop lowers the crown on Edward’s head
BISHOP
Then by the power vested in me by the
Father the Son and the Holy Ghost-
INT FOYER
Arab staggers forward Each step a small victory
Bowman arrow through his throat Looks up
Arab stands above
Bowman tries to say something Gurgles blood instead

For my friend

Arab’s scimitar LOPS Bowman’s head clean off

I declare that you shall rule from-

INT CATHEDRAL - OUTER CHAMBER

INT FOYER

Arab slowly kneels toward the Holy Places Softly he begins
to pray Trails off mid-sentence

INT CATHEDRAL

BISHOP
-this day onward Rise a king

DOORS open White light pours in Heads turn

Amelia stands on the threshold framed by the rising sun
Gypsy by her side One hell of an entrance

Slowly she walks toward Edward Regal despite her appearance

Crowd ripples as she’s recognized People jostle for a look cross
themselves whisper her name kneel at the sight of the
resurrected princess For the first time we see a hint of fear in-

EDWARD
Niece

AMELIA
Uncle It would appear that rumors of my
demise have been greatly exaggerated

EDWARD
I shall have to find those responsible

AMELIA
Then you won’t have to look very far

Edward tries to speak She cuts him off Her voice -- strong
confident and clear -- resonates in the cathedral It’s the
voice of a queen speaking law unto her subjects

AMELIA
This man murdered your king My father
His own flesh and blood Just as he
attempted to murder me He will of
course deny it But undoubtedly many
of you have heard him say that he saw
my body with his own eyes Yet here I
stand before you alive Not for the
lack of trying on my uncle’s part Just
ask him to account for all the violence
and bloodshed that tore apart our
beautiful city this past day

Edward is about to protest She presses on
AMELIA
He will of course say that I was
kidnapped by my father’s assassins
and these were merely attempts to
rescue me from their hands Yet one of
these men is here beside me He and
others like him have risked their
lives to safeguard mine Does it look
like I need to be rescued from him

Her eyes bore into Captain’s

Captain looks away To the members of the council

AMELIA
Or perhaps we should ask my uncle’s
soldiers why they were given orders
that no one be taken alive

AMELIA
He has of course assured you that
chaos will reign in the absence of a
ruler and that he will usher in a new
era of prosperity and peace But ask
yourselves this - if he lied about
everything else how long will it take
for him to break his word To raise
taxes in order to fuel his wars and
his lust for power To take your lands
in order to increase his

To the commoners

AMELIA
He will of course claim that he’s
your King rightfully anointed in the
eyes of God But ask yourselves this -
is this the kind of king God wants
The kind of king you deserve A
murderer A thief A liar A tyrant

And last but not least Edward

On Edward

AMELIA
I’m sorry Uncle I interrupted you
Perhaps you were about to say
something entirely different If so
please continue See if you can finda
single soul here who will believe your
innocence Or care to listen

Checkmate

EDWARD
-- YOU

Slowly he CLAPS

EDWARD
You magnificent bitch

AMELIA
I hereby charge you with murder and
high treason The sentence is death
But don’t worry You’ll be given a
fair trail (beat) I knew you’d hang
some day Uncle All you needed was
the rope Captain

Beat Captain nods Edward is surrounded A gallows smile
Takes off the crown It CLANGS by Amelia’s feet

EDWARD
You earned it

With that he strides out defiant to the last

It begins as a shout It becomes a chant And then a ROAR as
many lips utter one word over and over again

CROWD
Amelia AMELIA AMELIA
She turns to Bishop
AMELIA

My people were promised a coronation
I would hate to disappoint them

Bishop glances at the councilmen A silent understanding

BISHOP
As you wish my queen

And as she kneels before him the crowd rejoicing the bells
TOLLING we CRANE upward slowly DISSOLVING INTO

It’s quiet Peaceful Four simple graves lie side by side

There are no flowers no processions or trumpets Just four

walk away DISSOLVE TO

Zulu stands on a bow of a ship Stares out into the wide blue
ocean filled with hope and promise The voice behind him is
that of a child

Where are we going

He turns We turn with him revealing--

The ship’s deck packed with slaves Make it former slaves
We recognize faces from the market Men Women Children
Young Old Rich Poor All races classes and creeds mixed
together now equal in their search for a new beginning

Zulu sweeps the girl into his powerful arms Looks toward the
distant horizon And finally smiles

Einar is caught off guard

Yes

He takes out his swords One last look

He was the bravest man I ever met

He tosses the swords into the forge Picks up a hammer
Starts swinging Beat Einar approaches slow and uncertain
Gradually resumes his usual place Begins to help

They work together comfortable in each other’s silence

coming An age of reason An age of

Help me build it

Gypsy reads behind the words Softly

GYPSY
I don’t belong there Just as I
don’t belong here You will rule
and you will be loved and you will
be remembered Me I’m just a
thief who’ll die as I lived -
broke ignorant and alone

No good-byes He starts walking away She calls after

AMELIA
Why did you come back The
others they had their reasons
But you you had nothing to gain
GYPSY
Yes
AMELIA
Then why

He halts Holds her eyes in his own

GYPSY
Because you asked me to

The words hit her like a ton of bricks and she wants to say
something else when-

Doors open and the throne room is flooded with a multitude
of ministers courtiers and councilmen For the briefest of
moments their eyes remain locked across the crowded room

She walks back to the throne Gypsy strides to the exit Each to
his or her own destination Each to his or her own destiny

Gypsy crosses the threshold Looks back for one last time

Queen Amelia is sitting on her royal throne A man wearing
the robes of an advisor similar to Gregory’s leans over
whispering something in her ear

It’s the Lawyer

overlapping clashing a jigsaw puzzle assembling itself
