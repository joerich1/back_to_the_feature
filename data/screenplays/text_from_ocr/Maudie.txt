EXT AUNT IDAS HOUSE - DAY -- DIGBY NOVA SCOTIA 1937

MAUD DOWLEY an odd impish little creature with huge
saucers for eyes is lying on the tall overgrown grass
staring up at the sky smoking a cigarette Her fingers are
gnarled her knuckles swollen with arthritis A shadow
repeatedly moves across her face and leaves it

The shadow is from an old swing made of rope and wood
dangling from the branch of a tree The swing is swaying
back and forth As it slows down Maud reaches up and gives
it another push She keeps staring at the sky blowing her
smoke towards the sky and watching as it blends into the
clouds above She stares at the clouds curiously suddenly
finding shapes and objects A bunny rabbit A steam engine
Kittens

AUNT IDA a sturdy robust woman comes out carrying a
mop and bucket She is wearing an apron and a scarf around
her head Her sleeves are rolled up passed her elbows
Shes heavily into her spring cleaning Beads of sweat run
down her forehead

Maud picks herself up from the ground and takes a seat on
the swing Her feet dangling unable to reach the ground
Ida hurries past Maud a woman on a mission

The clothesline is filled with sheets billowing about in

the wind The fence is lined with hooked rugs out for
freshening Aunt Ida chucks the water from the bucket off

to the side of the house She takes the mop and starts to
whack the rugs Little clouds of dust appear with each whack

IDA
Look at that tsk tsk The dust is
going on the sheets

Ida takes the sheets off the line piling them up in her arms
Maud chucks her cigarette butt gets up and starts to help
She takes the armload of sheets from Ida

MAUD
I got it

But then Maud gets tangled in a sheet still on the line and
stumbles She drops a sheet

IDA
Maud I1l have to rewash it now
Its easier if I do it alone youre
too awkward

( )

Ida takes the sheets from her and heads into the house
Maud sits back down on the swing - discouraged

But then she leans back stares up at the clouds as they
move swiftly across the sky The rabbits in the clouds are
almost bunny-hopping their way across the sky

Maud gets up and walks towards the house As she stands on
the veranda she looks out on the landscape in wonder

Then she lights up another cigarette
TITLE MAUDIE
INT AUNT IDAS HOUSE - DINING ROOM -- DAY

Maud sits at the table while Ida brings her tea and biscuits
into the austere dining room

AUNT IDA
Here you go Would you like jam

MAUD

As Ida leaves the dining room

MAUD (CONTD)
But I can get it myself Aunt Ida

Moments later she places the jam down in front of her As
Ida fusses around the dining room

AUNT IDA

Maud looks up surprised

MAUD
Why Is he taking me back home

AUNT IDA

slips from her hand spilling everywhere

inside She struggles to put the last bobby pin in her hair
then grabs her belongings and hurries out of the room

against the door frame as Ida brings in his tea

AUNT IDA

the last bit of this conversation She tries to hide her
nervous concern with a smile

opposing brother

MAUD

of the package of her things photos trinkets A photograph
of her as a little girl with her cat Fluffy Some old paint
brushes and paints Melancholy

INT AUNT IDAS HOUSE - MAUDS BEDROOM -- NIGHT

crack in the bottom of her bedroom door as the SHADOW of
Aunt Idas footsteps pass by her room

Moments later Maud gets up and gently opens her bedroom
door and sneaks out

EXT JAZZ CLUB - NIGHT

Music pours out of the jazz club as Maud approaches trying
to contain her excitment She smiles at a couple who giggle
their way out of the club arms around each other Maud
gathers her nerve and heads inside

INT JAZZ CLUB - NIGHT

Inside a jazz club filled with people the flame on a
cigarette illuminates a dark corner

It is Maud puffing on a cigarette hiding from the crowd
her eyes scouring the room She has become an expert at
being inconspicuous She smokes with one hand and with the
other she fiddles with her sweater pulling it up over her
chin as she sways to the music

She spots a couple dancing Studies them for a bit She
looks to another couple sitting at a table talking
intimately She scours the room Her eyes land on a group
of women She studies them with quiet admiration as they
laugh She takes note of one woman DINA SHEA who is
obviously pregnant As she makes her way toward them she
bumps into a short stubby and bald MAN Maud sees him
and her face lights up

MAUD
Not sure who was gonna knock over
who
(quickly searching
for what to say next)
Mmmmm You smell like turkey supper
In a good way

(giggles)
He tries to make his way around her but she stops him
MAUD (CONTD)
I love this music Gets my feet
going like a couple a hammers
He shoves her aside annoyed
MAN
Christ get out of my way Who let

you in here

He walks around her She watches him for a moment feeling
the sting But then moves on with a hopeful determination

Men everywhere But she is completely invisible to them
INT JAZZ CLUB - NIGHT
With the band now on break Maud maneuvers her way through
the dark club She is smaller than everyone else in the

room and mostly goes unnoticed Shes feeling discouraged

( )

She is about to give up and go home until she sees Dina

the pregnant woman sitting on a bar stool by herself Maud
sidles up next to her

MAUD
Bet youre seven months

Maud smiles at the woman Shes very attractive even though
shes tired Shes smoking a cigarette

MAUD (CONTD)
Have you started nesting Getting
your house all fixed up nice and
cozy

DINA
Yeah a little

Maud smiles looking somewhat envious
MAUD
If youre looking to hire a sitter
Im looking for work

Dina smiles politely

DINA
We wont be hiring a sitter

MAUD
No harm in asking

Awkward silence for a beat

MAUD (CONTD)
Not often you sees a lady in your
condition out at night

DINA
Yeah well my old man is the guy
with the trumpet I like to make
sure he gets home alright if you
know what I mean

Maud smiles and leans in
MAUD
You love it when it kicks Fluttering

like a fish in a bowl

Maud stares at the womans belly

( )

MAUD (CONTD)
The heartburn thats no fun And
the trips to the bathroom

Maud laughs to herself - as if remembering The woman isnt
sure how to take Maud

MAUD (CONTD)
Oh my worth it though

Since Maud isnt going away the woman finally engages

DINA
How old is your baby

MAUD
Oh I dont have a baby

The woman is surprised

MAUD (CONTD)
Died at birth

DINA
Sorry

MAUD
I didnt see her but they told me
she was really deformed Sad

Then she looks at Dina who is mid-puff of a cigarette
somewhat disinterested

Maud cant resist

MAUD (CONTD)
Always worried it was cuz I smoked

Dina stops inhaling

MAUD (CONTD)
Probly wasnt Still you never
know

Dina hands her cigarette to Maud Maud takes it takes a
big inhale She smiles at the woman

MAUD (CONTD)
(ceferring to the
cigarette)
Thanks

INT AUNT IDA’S HOUSE - UPSTAIRS HALL - NIGHT 10

Maud sneaks her way back to her room tip toeing up the
stairs carefully trying not to make noise All the lights
are off in the house But as she arrives at the top --

Aunt Ida is standing there A stern look on her face

AUNT IDA

at Maud while she says her next bit

AUNT IDA

Maud walks out the door

She glares

EXT DIGBY STREET - DAY

Maud walks up the street pulling a little wooden wagon
She is somewhat hunched and walks with a little limp so she
moves slowly

As she passes by one house she admires a family playing
with their LITTLE GIRL in a pink dress She smiles to herself
as the little girl squeals over something

She continues on and gets many strange looks from people on
the street but she does her best to ignore them

INT GENERAL STORE - DAY

Maud walks into the general store her wagon left outside
She immediately heads towards the aisles Her eyes pour
over the shelves MR MCDOUGAL the storekeeper nods at
her

MR MCDOUGAL
Can I help you with something Miss
Dowley

MAUD
I need a sack of flour

MR MCDOUGAL
You wont find it on the shelves I
have that over here

MAUD
I know I like to look at the cans
All the different colours Its
pretty

She smiles at him - he gives an awkward smile back not
knowing how to take her

As Maud walks through the aisles the bell on the door rings
as someone else enters the store Maud continues to study
the shelves

MR MCDOUGAL (0S)
Well look whos gracing me with their
presence today What can I do for
you Everett

EVERETT (0S)

(quietly)
Im looking for a woman

( )

A what

MR MCDOUGAL (0S)

( )

12A 13

By now Mauds interest is piqued She gazes around the
corner catching a look at EVERETT LEWIS a tall gaunt
curmudgeonly man Everett shifts on his feet awkwardly

EVERETT
A housemaid a housemaid

Mr McDougal looks at him not sure if he understands

MR MCDOUGAL
Not the kind a thing we sell

Everett gives him an angry look

EVERETT
Am I an idiot I want to put up a
sign A whadayacall I need you to
write it

Everett hands him a square of paper The store keeper looks
at him skeptically for a moment then takes up a pen Everett
dictates

EVERETT (CONTD)
Looking for a housemaid Must bring
their own

Everett struggles to find the word

EVERETT (CONTD)
Whats the word Im looking for

MR MCDOUGAL
Sense of humour

EVERETT
Cleaning tools Thats good enough
Sign my name onto it Say my house
is over the road in Marshalltown

MR MCDOUGAL
You really need a housekeeper at
that little house

EVERETT
What does size got to do with
anything You dont got that big of
a store and you got three or four
people works here I need a hand I
need a hand

Everett takes the note and heads toward the back of the store
As he goes MAUD tip toes along to continue to observe

( ) 13
Everett POSTS the sign

CLOSE ON the sign - Looking for a housemaid must bring
cleaning supplies Contact Everett Lewis Main Rd
Marshalltown

Everett leaves without another word After the bell on the
door jangles indicating Everetts departure Maud approaches
the bulletin board She looks up and sees Everetts sign
Looking for a housemaid

She studies it with great interest She reaches up to get
the note but its too high Maud sees a stool and she
drags it across the floor climbs up on it She reaches
once more for the piece of paper this time she snatches it

Then Maud runs to the door and watches as Everett pushes his
wheelbarrow down the street She continues to watch him as
he heads off in the distance

EXT EVERETTS HOUSE - EVENING 14
Everett wheels a wheelbarrow along a winding lonely road

Dogs are barking loudly in the near distance This alerts
Everett causing him to speed up

He approaches a TINY HOUSE that sits on the side of the road

His yard is littered with junk His two dogs are tied on

outside a woodshed The dogs are both very agitated aiming
their attentions at the house

EVERETT
Whats going on

Everett creeps over to his house carefully once he sees his
door is swinging opened

EVERETT (CONTD)
I said whos there

The INTRUDER bolts out of the house and makes a run for it

EVERETT (CONTD)
Hey What did you take

Everett chases him up the road But hes not fast enough
the man heads off through the back woods

EVERETT (CONTD)
Lord Jesus

Everett debates continuing the chase but realizes its
useless

( )

14A

Everett stops chasing him and stomps back to the house and

glares at the dogs

( ) 15

EVERETT (CONTD)
What good are you if you dont scare
anything away Useless mutts

INT EVERETTS HOUSE - NIGHT

Everett is taking his money and stashing little bits in
different places - a bill inside a mug a few coins ina
jar Then he lifts up the cold storage trap door in the
floor and hides more money in a tin can then stuffs it into
the cold storage and closes the hatch once more

He grumbles to himself His 13x13 house is cluttered and
messy Lit by a lantern and heated with a wood stove

After Everett finishes stashing his money he climbs the
ladder up to his loft

INT EVERETTS HOUSE - LOFT -- NIGHT

Everett pulls off his two socks and lays them side by side
dangling over the bedpost He climbs under the cover and

tucks himself down in his bed He reaches towards the lantern

and turns down the flame until the room goes black

He lays there in the dark a tiny bit of moonlight
illuminating his face as his heavy breathing attempts to
settle into a rhythm He closes his eyes

EXT LANDSCAPE - MORNING

A wide landscape shot of the fields and landscape surrounding

Everetts little house which sits small and alone among the
huge overcast sky

INT EVERETTS HOUSE - DAY

Everett is alone in a small dimly lit shack stoking the
fire in the potbelly stove Its quiet not a sound except
for the hiss and dull roar of the fire

As he sips on his tea he picks up a little toy tin badge
and tries to fix the broken clip on the back that has come
loose

EXT MAIN ROAD MARSHALLTOWN - DAY

Maud is now dressed in her Sunday best wearing a dainty
pair of shoes as she makes her way up the road

To one side a large old Poor House DIGBY COUNTY ORPHANAGE
set back from the road

( )

15A

A few young children dressed in modest grey clothing run

about on the field playing a game of tag She smiles as she
passes them

( )

Then she looks across the field and pauses to watch the

COWS grazing

MAUD
Hello big boys
(whistles)
Hello there

She smiles at them and keeps going

Finally she comes upon Everetts lone small gloomy house
The yard is filled with junk wood piles and an old Model T
Ford in the driveway

She stops and looks around a little bewildered Then she
sees the wheelbarrow parked outside the house She gathers
her courage and heads towards the door The dogs see her
approaching

INT EVERETTS HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Everett continues to fiddle with the tin badge when he hears
the dogs start barking outside

MAUD (0S)
Hello little pups Hello little
pups

Everett is startled by the sound of a voice He stands
frozen

INTERCUT WITH

EXT EVERETTS HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Maud looks down at the dogs smiling

MAUD
Whatcha got on your feet Woolens
Are you wearing a pair of woolens
Down Down Ouch

The dogs are barking more aggressively Everett sneaks over
to the window tries to steal a look

He cant quite make her out

MAUD (CONTD)
Think Im the enemy do ya Dying
to chew on my limbs arent you
Want my jacket Take it creature
you can have it Good boy

( )

ON EVERETT as he creeps over to the other side standing
next to the wall and peers out the other window No sign
of her at all Then suddenly she KNOCKS on the door
Everett jumps He hesitates for a moment before opening it
Maud looks up at him with her two huge bright brown eyes
and smiles widely

MAUD (CONTD)

Her nose is running from the cold

EVERETT
Dowley

MAUD
Thats right

She sniffs again He just stares at her She continues
MAUD (CONTD)
I was I got the ad at the store
the one you posted looking for a
house maid I’m answering it

He looks at her distastefully

EVERETT
I’m looking for a woman

Maud giggles

MAUD
What do you think I am

Everett sizes up the tiny odd looking misshapen woman as
he walks past her and heads towards his shed

EVERETT
Don’t know

She follows him
MAUD
I walked here from Digby My feet
are knobbed off

He gathers an armload of wood She huddles her arms close
to her body for warmth

( ) 18

MAUD (CONTD)
Wouldn’t mind a cup a tea you can
tell me what your lookin’ for

He looks at her skeptically then jerks his head for her to
come in She follows him into the house

INT EVERETTS HOUSE — CONTINUOUS

He tries to watch her out of the corner of his eye as she
takes the place in a grin on her face Suddenly Everett
is more aware of his rundown filthy little house The air
is thick with heat and smoke from the stove Every surface
is filled with clutter and dust

MAUD
Soyou’re looking for a cleaner
A live in

EVERETT
I dunno about live in

Maud looks around the one room house

MAUD
Gonna say You’re lookin’ for a
small woman

Maud gives him a big smile as she refers to herself

MAUD (CONT’D) (CONTD)
Mom always joked that I was a size
“tiny”

Maud chuckles Everett doesn’t

MAUD (CONTD)
I was hoping you were looking for a
live in just the same

Everett is surprised at her boldness Maud walks towards a
chair She sits a polite smile on her face She looks
around some more “admiringly”

MAUD (CONT’D) (CONTD)
So this is all yours This house

Everett cant help but boast
EVERETT

Everett hesitates

EVERETT

Maud laughs uncomfortably

MAUD
They says I get on like I’m twelve

She pulls the sweater up over her chin an obvious nervous
tick Everett gets an old dirty mug pours a bit of water
in it swishes it around and gives the water a flick It

sprays across Maud She giggles again

MAUD (CONTD)
Oh there you go No need for a

She giggles again He doesnt

Everett sticks a teabag in the mug and takes it over to the
stove He splashes some boiling water from the kettle into
the cup and brings it over to Maud

EXT AUNT IDA’S HOUSE —- DAY

IDA
Think of your mother What would

IDA

That includes a bit of pride Common
sense Dignity She would be ashamed
of you

Maud feels stung by this

Youre not bawling are you

She takes a breath gathering herself

MAUD
Trying to figure out how to ask you
about pay

He wasnt expecting this

MAUD (CONTD)
Im assuming Im working for room

To make it feel official

His silence is a begrudging yes She smiles
INT EVERETTS HOUSE - DAY 42

Everett walks into his shack Maud follows behind He leaves
Maud standing there by the door with her bag as he stokes
the fire

She looks around the place Everett stands awkwardly
shifting on his feet after a moment he turns and leaves
the house again

More awkwardness as Maud looks for a place to lay her bag
There is no room Everything is caked in dirt and grime
Finally Maud sits in a chair her bag on her lap She
studies several old worn mugs that hang on nails along the
wall Mugs that are chipped and stained but that had once
been quite pretty

Everett comes back in with a stack of wood in his arm

MAUD
There you are thought you left me

She giggles He drops the pile of wood by the fire and a
chunk of wood lands on Maud’s foot

( )

She tries to hide the pain

MAUD (CONTD)
Sowhat do you want me to do first

EVERETT
I dunno I guess -

He looks around not sure what to say Their mutual
discomfort thickens the air Finally

EVERETT (CONTD)
If I got to stand here and tell you
everything I’1l just do it myself

He leaves again Maud looks around the tiny home ONE room
with a tiny staircase going to a loft upstairs

Nothing but a table two chairs an arm chair a wood stove
and some shelves Some potatoes and a turnip some carrots
sit on the floor next to the stove A bucket with water in
it as well Maud stands up Where to begin

Finally she unzips her little bag and starts to unpack a
few of her things

She notices a horizontal wooden beam and neatly lays her
things on it in a row her brush her mirror a picture of
her mother one of FLUFFY her cat etc

EXT EVERETTS HOUSE - DAY

Everett is outside curious about Maud as he discreetly
peers in through the window He watches as she hobbles around
collecting the dirty dishes

He can hear the sounds of her humming to herself He turns

up his nose at this cheeriness As he pulls a trolly Everett
does a sharp whistle to the dogs They follow him as he

heads down the road

INT EVERETTS HOUSE - EVENING

Maud has a pot of soup on the stove and she has a portion
of the house cleaned

But she has gotten distracted by Everett’s things unable to
resist poking around She sits in a rocking chair as she
sifts through his old tin can filled with tattered photographs
and oddities A photograph of a young boy with a woman

looks like his mother A tiny wooden incomplete chiseled
wooden horse The little tin toy sherrifs badge we saw

him fix A little toy gun made out of wood and nails

( )

Maud studies them with interest Then Everett walks in the

door startling Maud

EVERETT
What is going on here

Maud drops the can of photos

EVERETT (CONTD)

Get outta my stuff You think that’s

what I brought you here for

Maud gets on her hands and knees picking up the photos

EVERETT (CONTD)

He sees a pot cooking on the stove

MAUD
I was taking a break I made

He dips the ladle in tastes the soup

in my

soup

He sneers and throws

the ladle down aggressively Maud jumps with fright

EVERETT

What you put in that I might look

stupid but I’m far from it

Look

MAUD

Everett looks at her it suddenly dawning on him

EVERETT

You wanting money and for what
You dont know a click about cleaning

MAUD

I just need to get the hang of it

EVERETT

I dont want a lazy arse around here

Pack up AND GET

He swipes her little belongings off the shelf and onto the
floor Then he gets up and climbs the ladder to the loft

Maud can’t believe her ears

( ) 36

MAUD
Where am I s’posed to go

EVERETT
You shoulda thought about that when
you were sitting around twiddling
your thumbs

MAUD
I needed a day to find my feet you

what you wanted me to do with your
stuff I’m just gettin’ a lay of

the land

EVERETT
I’m not gonna look after ya I

looking to rob me Now get out

He climbs up to the loft Maud watches in disbelief unsure
of what to do

EVERETT (0S) (CONTD)
Get OUT

Maud fights back the tears as she gathers her things and
leaves

EXT EVERETTS HOUSE - EVENING

Maud stands outside of Everett’s house The wind blows
wildly

Maud starts to walk towards the road but she stops and looks
back to Everett’s house She is completely lost as to where
to go Standing in the middle of nowhere Maud looks as if
shes about to cry But instead

-She turns her back to the wind and leans against it It
is so powerful that it almost holds her up She outstretches
her arms and lets the wind beat against her

This action starts to soothe her She finally closes her
eyes a smile spreading across her face

INT EVERETTS HOUSE - UPSTAIRS LOFT - NIGHT

Everett stares out his window at Maud as the wind gives her
a beating while she stands in the middle of the yard

He blows out his lantern

and climbs into bed

INT EVERETTS HOUSE - MORNING 47

The next morning Everett wakes up to sounds coming from
downstairs He climbs down from the loft and sees Maud
scrubbing the floor

He stares at her in disbelief She is sweating buckets as
she uses all her force to ring out what is left of her cloth
It is killing her hands but she presses on

Meanwhile she has made an attempt to set the table His
mug and his plate are neatly placed Two slices of toast
wait for him Some freshly picked wildflowers are placed in
a bottle

Everett completely ignores her and climbs down the stairs
He gathers his things to head out for work He grabs the

toast slugs back the tea and heads out the door without
saying a word

She smiles Then starts to clean the smoke stains from the
walls Her crippled hands makes scrubbing very difficult
but she withstands the pain to get the job done

EXT EVERETTS HOUSE - DAY 48

Maud digs a chicken out of the coop but it breaks free
She chases it around the yard She finally catches it

MAUD
Don’t blame you my son I’d run
too

She takes it over to the wood stump it fights to break free
but she holds on tightly

MAUD (CONTD)
God bless you poor soul

Maud sends the ax down on the chicken’s neck Feathers and
blood fly about as Maud winces

INT EVERETTS HOUSE - DAY 49

Maud has a stew cooking on the stove as she continues to
clean despite the pain it is causing her

As she removes things off the shelf she notices the once
blue shelf is thick with dust She looks at it thoughtfully
for a moment before she closes her eyes and BLOWS on it
Some of the dust blows away but revealing more dust and
grime The blue is still buried

( )

On her way to get the scrub brush she notices an old can of
green paint Maud eyes it

INT EVERETTS HOUSE - DAY 50

INT EVERETTS HOUSE - NIGHT 51

Everett comes in late at night Maud sits waiting nervously
in the arm chair

Everett says nothing He sits on a broken chair by the door
and removes his boots He sees the steamy pot of stew on
the stove He looks around checking the place out then
looks at Maud

EVERETT
That’s my chair

She gets up

MAUD
Let me get you a bowl a’ stew

She goes over to the stove and scoops up a hefty serving
then places it at the table

Everett sits down and eats He eyeballs her little things
on the shelf bothered by the presence of her belongings

Maud goes over to Everett’s boots and neatly places them
side by side She watches out of the corner of her eye as
he eats

EVERETT
Whered you get the chicken

MAUD

Everett is surprised and silently impressed

MAUD
Where am I to sleep

Everett and Maud lay on either side of the mattress in the
loft bedroom
It is awkward and silent Maud tries to keep her eyes
closed but she can’t sleep She hears heavy sighs coming
out of Everett lying next to her
Meanwhile on Everetts side of the bed he is forcing the
sound of his breathing feigning sleep while he lies there
completely awake his wheels turning

The moon slowly disappears while the light begins to change
from black to orange As the sun rises over the landscape

serve up his supper He watches her but shes clumsy and
slow Finally he grabs the serving spoon out of her hand

EVERETT
Gimme some elbow room woman

Maud sits down at the table with him as he eats She waits
a moment before speaking

MAUD
Thinking about my brother Charles

Everett doesnt look up

MAUD (CONTD)
He used to run one a them jazz clubs
for awhile Always people on his
back for money he owed them
He always said people were trying to
rob him out but he couldnt prove
it Must be tough running a business

EVERETT
I owes nobody

MAUD
Apparently Charles never owed anyone
but he never had proof It was hard
to keep track of it all

EVERETT
Only if youre stupid

MAUD
Maybe And youre not Youre a
really smart man Too smart probably
You can keep track of all this in
your head but most people cant

Everett likes the sound of this but says nothing

MAUD (CONTD)
You got to dumb it down

the name down on the card and the amount owed

She looks at herself in the mirror for a moment Its
difficult for her But she smiles a little and takes her
paint brushes and paints a little tiny flower on the frame

Then she turns back to a large painting on a wooden board
that is half-way finished She makes her large unrefined
paint strokes An outdoor scene A tire swing now hangs
from a tree A little girl in a pink dress

Maud looks out the window and sees Everett chopping wood
He effortlessly splits each wood chuck in two with one fell
swoop He is concentrated and relentless

Maud stops her painting for a moment and watches him
admiringly A sweet shy smiles comes across her face

She turns her attention back to the painting and starts to
paint Everett in his plaid shirt hard at work

Everett looks out the window of the store where Maud is
waiting outside Then he leans into the storekeeper
angrily

watches through the window as Everett heads towards her with

into his back Everett looks at her his face softening

He moves closer to her and fumbles around under the blanket
Maud lays still as the dark room is filled with the sounds
of Everett’s awkward grunts

Maud hangs onto Everett appreciating the closeness She
hugs tightly into him

But it lasts only momentarily Within moments he is finished
and he rolls off of her

over and touches him but he recoils

who can find the proper investments

MAUD
You had to sell mommas house to pay

heading towards the house on his bicycle

He pulls potatoes out of a bag and starts peeling them

Maud looks at him with his back to her A quiet unease
between them Maud goes back to painting at her spot in the

downplays it

MAUD (CONTD)
But Im telling him I dont care

money like every body else Ill

She looks to him hoping this pleased him But Everett leaves
the house without saying a word

heads up the road Mauds eyes are filled with worry and
uncertainty After he is out of sight she turns back to
her painting She coughs again

The camera goes in closer on Everetts face revealing his
nervousness his insecurity He swallows then clears this
throat trying to find something clever to say The

I like that you ignore the shadows

Maud smiles unable to think of what to say Finally she
holds out the painting

MAUD
You might like this one

Kay studies it for a long time Maud watches Kay proudly
Kay seems almost speechless Her face is serious

KAY
I need this painting I love it

Maud smiles

MAUD
Have it

KAY
How much do I owe you

Maud shakes her head

MAUD
You don’t owe me for that take it

KAY
No no you can’t give it away How
much

Maud sees Everett walking towards her She speaks quietly

MAUD
I think that little girl is you
Please take it

She smiles at Kay Kay smiles back somehow understanding
She takes the painting and walks away

Maud discreetly tries to keep her eye on Kay as she climbs
into the car She watches fixated as the car pulls off
the side of the road and drives off into the distance
Everett stands by her for a moment

INT EVERETTS HOUSE - NIGHT

Maud sits at her table painting her work only half finished
She works quietly Then without warning she suddenly BURSTS
into tears She lets herself cry and after a moment she
flops over on the table onto her painting She cries and
cries

Then she gets up The paint from her picture now on the
side of her face and her shirt She looks at her ruined
painting wipes away her tears and starts to fix it

Everett is up in bed Maud still sits at her table staring
out the window into the black quiet night She wipes the
paint off of her face and her shirt with an old wet rag
Then Maud hoists herself out of the chair and heads towards
the ladder

Her foot slips on a rung and Maud tumbles over and falls to
the ground

EVERETT (0S)
Whats going on down there

Everett pokes his head down to see what has happened and
sees Maud laid out on the floor

INT EVERETTS HOUSE - DAY 150

Frank and Everett CARRY in a little day bed as Maud sits
feebly at her table

FRANK
Back your end in there Ev

MAUD

EVERETT
Watch out

Everett lays his end down and they squeeze the day bed in
the corner

INT EVERETTS HOUSE - EVENING 151
Maud now lays back on a DAY BED that has been squeezed into

the small home Her things have been rearranged downstairs

She paints a painting from her bed Shes slower now Still
thoughtful but there is less joy in it Everett brings her

a cup of tea

MAUD
Some housemaid I became

EVERETT
The only one applied for the job

Everett gives her a slight smile
INT EVERETTS HOUSE - NIGHT 152
Everett comes downstairs and stokes the fire

Maud is asleep on the couch her breathing is sounding
increasingly laboured

EVERETT
Maudie You alright

( )

Everett goes over to see her and realizes she isn’t very

responsive

EVERETT (CONTD)
Maud

She tries to open her eyes and speak

MAUD

EXT EVERETTS HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

Everett has Maud bundled up in a blanket and carries her to
the truck He lays her in the passenger seat then gets in

They speed away down the road

INT TRUCK - MOMENTS LATER

They drive down the road Maud tries to speak but can’t

Everett is in a panic
EVERETT

by her side She is more alert now She reaches out to
touch Everett but he’s too far away He moves in closer

EVERETT
I knew you were getting sicker

time Id ask you youd lie to me

( )

He runs up

156
He sits on the edge of her bed
She slowly feebly traces the outline of the rose on his
arm

He gently strokes her face

EVERETT (CONTD) (CONTD)
You got beautiful eyes Maud Lewis

Maud smiles feebly flattered He points to her chest

EVERETT (CONTD) (CONTD)
So much beauty in there it’s spillin’
out your two peepers Sometimes I
look at them eyes I think the sun
is shining in my face

MAUD
Go on

EVERETT
Its true I look at your face and
I cant believe I ever thought you
werent perfect

She reaches over with her gnarled up hand and struggles to
outstretch her fingers She wraps them around his hand

MAUD
I wishI wish I was better at
looking after you everyone always
had to be looking after me

EVERETT
Shut up You looked after me You
looked after me

He points to his heart as he fights back tears
EVERETT (CONT’D) (CONTD)
You looked after me Miss Now gimme

She “shhhh’s” him She pulls him in closer to her face

MAUD
I know you love me Ev

MAUD (CONTD)
We didnt have the things people
think you need in order to be lovable
But yet we had love

( ) 109

Maud is fading

MAUD (CONTD)
Who woulda thought two odd socks
would make such a perfect pair

He looks at her pleadingly but she closes her eyes and fades
away

EXT HOSPITAL - DAY

Everett is trying to start his truck It won’t start He
punches the steering wheel

EVERETT
God DAMN stupid truck

He gets out of the truck and lifts up the hood He fiddles
around with it trying to fix it Swallowing all his
emotions He gets back in the truck tries again This
time it starts He pulls out

INT EVERETTS HOUSE - DAY

Everett is home by himself The brightly painted jam-packed
little house feels empty Everett sits in Maud’s chair and
paints a little “Maud-like” painting on a card He paints
dogs Nowhere near her detail or charm

He stops and stares at her paintings on the wall The little
chicken So cheerful So happy He reaches out and touches
the bird Then turns back to the painting He scrapes the
paintbrush on an old sardine tin thick with Maud’s paint

Then he signs the card Everett Lewis He stares at it
long and hard his eyes filling with tears Having a second
thought he PAINTS over the name

He looks out the window No cars No visitors Nothing

He looks back to the painting and once again paints her
name on the board Then he THROWS the paintbrush across the
room

EXT EVERETTS HOUSE - DAY

Everett sits outside his house with paintings propped up
against the house to sell His poor knock-offs which lack
Mauds care or detail He stares off into space as a couple
of stragglers walk around looking at the art work the faded
paintings on the walls

( )

159

Then suddenly SANDRA pulls up She gets out of her car
She stares at Everett He looks sad and incomplete

She stands at a distance for a moment Then finally walks
towards him Then she sits down next to Everett

SANDRA
I missed the funeral

He doesnt look at her She doesnt look at him They just
sit in silence together

INT EVERETTS HOUSE - LATER 160

Everett walks into the house Everywhere he looks everywhere
he rests his eyes there is the hand of Maud

He sits down on the day bed He kicks off his boots and
pulls off a sock He stares at his feet one sock on one
sock off He runs his hand along the empty space of Mauds
bed before clutching her pillow

Then he looks out the window and looks up at the clouds
Suddenly hes able to see the clouds take shape a cheerful
puppy dog surrounded by white puffy flowers

As we fade out

Everett Lewis died in 1979 nine years after Maud in their
little 13x13 home

This little house can be found at a permanent exhibit at the
Nova Scotia Art Gallery in Halifax Nova Scotia
