TITLE SEQUENCE

As the credits run we INTERCUT the following two sequences

EXT NEVADA DESERT - IDOLS - DAY

A SLOW DRIFT through a collection of crudely constructed
surreal six-foot tall IDOLS Like modern demons
Grotesque Disturbing WE LAP DISSOLVE between details of
their twisted anatomies headlamp eyes bright metal claws
broken glass teeth

EXT NEVADA ROADS - DESERT - DAY

Two vehicles one a Volkswagen bus decorated with stylized
flames the other a 66 Thunderbird speeding along a series
of eerily empty desert roads somewhere in a wilderness of
sand and heat

END CREDITS
CUT WIDE TO
EXT NEVADA DESERT - DAY

A violent WIND HOWLS around but through the sand we-can just
make out a large ominous building the HOUSE of William
Nix Its walls are white-washed and scrawled with GRAFFITI
The family of IDOLS surrounds the doorway guarding it ON
SCREEN the words Nevada - Thirteen Years Ago

EXT NIXS HOUSE - DAY

Were at the front door now which stands open Leaning
against the door-frame is a scrawny wild-eyed YOUTH about
sixteen His name is BUTTERFIELD Hes got a brooding
almost sultry look on his face One of his eyes is black
the other milky blue Hes whittling something with a
scalpel Distantly the sound of CAR ENGINES Butterfield
narrows his eyes

BUTTERFIELDS POV

The Volkswagen bus and Thunderbird are approaching the
house

BUTTERFIELD
(softly)
Swann
He turns from the door In his haste he drops the WOOD hes
whittling Hes been carving a DEATHS HEAD

INT NIXS HOUSE - ROOMS AND CORRIDORS - DAY

The house no longer serves any domestic function It has
become the temple and dormitory of Nixs small apocalyptic
cult As we go through the house with Butterfield we glimpse
a little of what life here is like

The rooms are murky and chaotic The walls PAINTED with
scenes of cities and landscapes BURNING and creatures from
some unspeakable nightmare ATTACKING RAPING and DEVOURING
helpless humanity The atmosphere is joyless and
oppressive

The passages become progressively darker as the boy makes his
way to the heart of the house Only OIL LAMPS set on the
floor light these claustrophobic corridors

BUTTERFIELD
Master

INT NIXS HOUSE - MEDITATION ROOM - DAY

A dozen CULTISTS sit cross-legged on the floor in front of
their leader WILLIAM NIX His black hair grows to his
shoulders His eyes are deep and glittering his voice
seductive A terrifying yet charismatic presence

All the Cultists - who are a cross-section of obsessives -
wear the same simple T-shirts painted with the cults SIGIL
They watch Nix in adoration

As Nix speaks he juggles a FLAME passing it from hand to
hand with casual ease

NIX
And the fire said to me Nix Nix
youre my instrument From now on
youll be called the Puritan

CULTISTS
(murmuring)
Puritan

NIX You will find a few good men and women and together
together you will cleanse the world

CULTISTS

Butterfield enters

BUTTERFIELD
Master
Nix looks up
BUTTERFIELD

Nix rises smiling
NIX

(to Cultists)
Well come back to this Get about
your business

As the Cultists disperse Nix and Butterfield exit into
INT NIXS HOUSE - SANCTUM - DAY

A place of nightmares Hanging from the middle of the ceiling
is another grotesque SCULPTURE three times the bulk of a
large man and made of metal fly-blown animal parts and
knotted rope It is vaguely cruciform but its swaying
creaking bulk is not even faintly Christian It isa
perverse sickening image evoking insanity and agony

From the shadows in the corner we hear a young girls soft
SOBBING

NIX
Hush

Nix goes to the GIRL She is twelve beautiful blonde and
presently in a state of mortal fear She sits bound ina
fetal position her face soaked with SWEAT and TEARS her
mouth BLOODIED her cheek BRUISED

NIX
I said hush

GIRL
Please Let me go

From the opposite corner the SCREECH of Nixs pet BABOON
Nix goes to it The animal is large and lethal

NIX
(to Baboon)
What is it
The Baboon pulls on its chain staring at the Girl and baring
its teeth as it screeches

NIX
(to Girl)
I think hes in love

He unshackles the Baboon The animal pads toward the Girl
trailing its chain

GIRL
Keep it away from me

Nix catches hold of its chain Holds it back The Baboon
starts screeching again scrabbling at the Girl its NAILS
catching her arms and legs drawing BLOOD

GIRL
Please please

Nix watches her terror dispassionately
BUTTERFIELD
(also watching wide-
eyed)

Want me to shoot Swann

NIX

BUTTERFIELD
He wants your magic

jacket the three strange pieces of METALWORK There are
SCREWS in then all

NIX
(seeing)
Swann What are you doing

SWANN
Binding you

He clamps one of the pieces over Nixs EYES It fits like an
eyeless mask Nix thrashes and SCREAMS Swann lays his
hands on the side of the mask and — LIKE MAGIC -- his touch
makes the screws tighten of their own accord grinding into
Nixs flesh and bone with a gut- wrenching SOUND BLOOD runs
from the screw-holes

NIX
Fuck you Swann Fuck you

Now the second piece over his MOUTH

NIX
Sw-

Hes silenced The piece screws itself into-his head like
the first And now comes the third and final piece over
the nose and into the ears Again it screws itself into
place

Swann has done all he can He retreats from Nixs body as
it continues to convulse We go from face to ashen face as
each man and woman watches and waits Why wont he die

And now at last the violence of Nixs death-throes
diminishes Nixs body bends like a bow arching off the
ground and with one last terrible spasm he dies

GIRL
(quietly)
Is it finished
SWANN

Theres a strange RUMBLING SOUND approaching from round the
corner Harry chances a look Theres a short length of
passageway leading to an open door From the threshold a
CRYSTAL BALL rolls towards Harry BLOOD- SMEARED This is
the source of the rumbling Harry stops the ball before it
falls down the stairs

hair is drawn back into a pony-tail His mismatched eyes -
one black one milky blue tell us that he is Butterfield
His hands are BLOODY and he carries one last SCALPEL
HARRY
(to Butterfield)
Dont touch him

Butterfield strokes the wounds on Quaids cheek Quaid sobs
in pain

BUTTERFIELD
What are you going to do about it

Millers hand tears at the wood around the lock from the
other side His fingers appear scrabbling to tear the lock
out Harry doesnt move or Miller will be through

BUTTERFIELD
(to Harry)
Ever watched a man die If you
watch very closely you can
sometimes see the soul escaping
And if youre very quick you can
catch it

QUAID
Please Butterfield I wasnt
there Ask Pimm

BUTTERFIELD

disappeared They knew the Puritan
was coming home

As this exchange goes on Miller pulls the lock out of the
door and starts to THROW HIMSELF against it from the other
side Its all Harry can do to keep himself from being
pitched across the room He looks around for some means of
defense Theres a crack in the drapes to the left of the
table Behind it a WINDOW

BUTTERFIELD
So do you Youve seen the future
Havent you

against the drape The window CRACKS the drape comes down
around Miller Amber STREETLIGHT floods in

scalpel from his hands

Miller meanwhile is struggling to free himself from the
folds of the drapes Harry lands a solid KICK to the mans
belly Miller is THROWN back against the cracked window

I think we make our own futures

Harry makes an approving MURMUR

HARRY
Whats the connection

DOROTHEA
(covering now but well)
I dont exactly know
Philip doesnt like to talk about
the past

HARRY
Why not

Dorothea stops talking Takes off her sunglasses Her gaze
is troubled but direct There is an attraction between the
two of them that simmers beneath the dialogue

DOROTHEA
Hes a secretive man

HARRY
And you dont ask questions

DOROTHEA
We dont share our lives the way a
lot of people do

HARRY
Does that mean

DOROTHEA
We havent slept in the same bed
for years

HARRY
But obviously you still care what
happens to him

DOROTHEA
We wouldnt be having this
conversation if I didnt Swanns

EXT WILTERN THEATRE - NIGHT

CRANE DOWN from a looming STANDEE of Swann perched above the
theatre marquee SPOTLIGHTS rake the skies The sidewalk
below is jammed with AUDIENCE MEMBERS STAR-SPOTTERS and
PHOTOGRAPHERS This is a flashy prestigious event LIMOS
are disgorging scantily- dressed STARLETS and smiling MONEY
MEN a NEWS TEAM is interviewing audience members as they
file in

The atmosphere is noisy and excited Amid the throng Harry
He makes his way inside

INT WILTERN THEATRE - AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

The atmosphere is closer to a rock concert than a
conventional stage show Security people with walkie-
talkies roam the aisles the audience buzzes with barely
controlled hysteria
Harry heads down the aisle eyes on the stage A star-lit
CURTAIN covers it Six rows from the stage is Dorothea
already in her seat She smiles lavishly happy to see him

DOROTHEA
Im glad you could make it

Harry takes a seat beside her

HARRY
Hey this is a big deal for me You
know what seats like this cost in
New York

INT WILTERN THEATRE - STAGE - NIGHT
Center-stage behind the closed curtains Swann is ready for
the opening of the show TECHNICIANS buzz around him like

flies

SWANN
Valentin

Valentin emerges from the wings patting the PANTHER that is
waiting there

SWANN
(irritated)
Valentin
VALENTIN
Im here
SWANN

The guy with Dorothea Is that who
I think it is

Valentin nods
ON SWANN his expression unreadable

SWANN
Hes young

MUSIC strikes up A dramatic Wagnerian chord Valentin
hurries away Swanns expression becomes very focused

1ST TECHNICIAN
(to Swann)
Ready
SWANN
Ready

Swann rises up into the flies

1ST TECHNICIAN
How the fuck does he do that

2ND TECHNICIAN
Its wires man

1ST TECHNICIAN
I never seen no wires

2ND TECHNICIAN
(sarcastic)
So what is it Magic

INT WILTERN THEATRE - AUDITORIUM AND STAGE - NIGHT

The LIGHTS are DIMMING Harry glances across at Dorothea
whose gaze is intent

The LIGHTS go OUT The MUSIC SWELLS and the CURTAINS fly
apart A spectacle worthy of Seigfried and Roy is about to
blast our senses Magic for the 90s a wild erotic ride
into mystery

SWANN (V0O)
Ladies and gentlemen You are
standing on the threshold of a
miracle

A vortex of SMOKE and LIGHT swirls in the middle of the
stage

The vortex BLAZES --

And suddenly Swann SWEEPS DOWN out of the flies as the floor
of the stage opens and the head of a glittering razor
toothed DRAGON emerges in a cloud of CRIMSON SMOKE

Swann raises his hands above his head and a SPEAR
miraculously appears in his grasp He descends on the
dragon Its a classic image St Michael smiting the
Devil Swann drives the spear down the throat of the dragon
The theatre SHAKES at its dying ROARS Then the head cracks
open and out of the dragons mouth emerge a dozen scantily
dressed DANCERS male and female Swann throws down the
spear and where it strikes the stage his PANTHER appears

A ROAR of APPLAUSE from the audience Swanns plain white
tunic falls away from him as he descends By the time his
feet touch the stage he is dressed in a star- shot TUXEDO
The PANTHER licks his hand in welcome The MUSIC comes to a
crescendo The DANCERS freeze in their erotic dance In the
sudden hush Swann speaks in a whisper

SWANN
My friends come with meinto
the Great Beyond

A barrage of LIGHTS and MUSIC erupt
The AUDIENCE APPLAUDS wildly
ON HARRY and Dorothea

HARRY
Hes good

DOROTHEA
You havent seen anything yet

INT WILTERN THEATRE - LOBBY - NIGHT
The doors SQUEAK as a gust of WIND blows through them

Butterfield stands in the lobby listening to the muted
SOUNDS of MUSIC and APPLAUSE Then he offers his ticket to
the TICKET-COLLECTOR and steps inside

INT WILTERN THEATRE - AUDITORIUM AND STAGE - NIGHT

A new musical motif hangs in the air MUSIC announcing
danger

The AUDIENCE watches intently nervously
ON HARRY and DOROTHEA

DOROTHEA
(a whisper)
This is the new illusion

ON STAGE Swann is bound to a spinning WHEEL while the
DANCERS dressed like Boschian DEMONS cavort around him
somersaulting and leaping over eruptions of yellow FLAME
Its a scene from Daniels Inferno Above him a dozen
glittering SWORDS - six feet long - are descending He
struggles to free himself The MUSIC gets more exciting as
the wheel spins faster and faster

Suddenly a sword DROPS It falls between Swanns
outstretched legs skewering the wheel Then ANOTHER close
to his head

ON HARRY Hes tense Excited
BACK TO STAGE Swann is free I He throws off the last
shackle and uses it to thrust into the mechanism of the

wheel Theres a theatrical BLAZE of white-hot SPARKS

The wheel slows He starts to step off it as another of the
the swords DROPS

The AUDIENCE GASPS Swann smiles and TRIPS

As he FALLS the sword runs through the middle of his back
carrying him down to the still-spinning wheel and pinning
him there Some of the DANCERS continue to cavort Some
stop

More GASPS from the audience

ON HARRY having a --

FLASHBACK Harrys hand turns over the final tar of card
The scene on the stage is that image coming to life

HARRY
Theres something wrong

ON Swann as a second sword FALLS skewering his thigh and a
third running through his buttock and a fourth and fifth
until TEN SWORDS have entered his body

ON THE AUDIENCE not certain whether this is a trick or not
The MUSIC has stopped In the silence somebody GIGGLES
nervously A couple of PEOPLE break into APPLAUSE but it
dies away in a matter of moments

ON DOROTHEA AND HARRY

DOROTHEA
No

ON THE STAGE Swann raises his head and looks out at his
wife his eyes already glassy with imminent death He

reaches out towards her and then sags on the wheel dead

There are GASPS now from the audience Murmurs of disgust
sobs of horror

1ST AUDIENCE MEMBER
What happened

2ND AUDIENCE MEMBER
Its a trick

3RD AUDIENCE MEMBER
Somebody help him

The curtains start to close
ON Dorothea tears of shock filling her eyes

DOROTHEA
(to Harry)
Ive got to get to him

The AUDIENCE is rising now as the horror of what theyve
seen sinks in There is panic A few people have fainted
One or two are even praying

Harry carves out a path down to the stage for Dorothea
against the flood of the exiting crowd

HARRY
Out of the way Out of the way

He helps Dorothea onto the stage and lifts the curtain so
she can duck beneath it

INT WILTERN THEATRE - STAGE - NIGHT

Chaos PEOPLE running sobbing puking some simply standing
watching Valentin is already at the body with the STAGE
MANAGER at his side

VALENTIN
(to Stage Manager)
Get then out of here for Gods
sake --

STAGE MANAGER
You heard him Its not a fucking
show

He starts to physically push the crowd back Harry grabs his
arm

STAGE MANAGER
Who are you

Harry uses his grip to gently but efficiently move the STAGE
MANAGER out of Dorotheas way She goes to Swanns body
which has been removed from the wheel
INT WILTERN THEATRE - AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

The audience is clearing now But Butterfield is coming
towards the stage with an ambiguous look on his face Is he
enraged Or puzzled Or both

MILLER
Psst

Miller stands at an open door leading below the stage
Butterfield enters
INT WILTERN THEATRE - STAGE - NIGHT

Dorothea kneels at Swanns side A few yards from her Harry
examines the mechanism of the wheel

DOROTHEA
(softly)
Swann

A DOCTOR appears

DOCTOR
Im a doctor Let me through

The Doctor checks Swanns body

DOCTOR
(to Dorothea)
Im sorry

Harry has discovered a CABLE snaking down beside the device
Hes suspicious He slips round to the back of the
mechanism and climbs down beneath the stage tracing the
cable as he goes

WILTERN THEATRE - BELOW STAGE - NIGHT

Its an eerie shadowy space filled with the PROPS that are
used in the show including the DRAGON we saw at the
beginning From above we hear FOOTSTEPS and VOICES muted
and echoing

The cable ends in bare wires Whatever was here has been
taken

A NOISE behind Harry He swings round Sees a shadowy
FIGURE ducking away
HARRY
Hey

He gives chase Loses the man in the shadows Stops and
listens for movement

Suddenly Miller steps out of the shadows with a plank of
wood and smashes it into Harrys face

Harry reels back Falls to his knees BLOOD running from his
nose Miller pulls Harrys GUN out of his jacket

MILLER
Got you fucker

Harry is facing the dragons head dazed And now out of
the dragons mouth comes Butterfield

BUTTERFIELD

Harry is barely holding on to consciousness

HARRY

Butterfield comes a little closer

HARRY
(feigning a near collapse)

Butterfield leans in And Harry grabs him by the balls --
literally -- rising as he does so

BUTTERFIELD
Aah

Harry THROWS Butterfield aside Butterfield hits the ground
in agony and Harry swings round to protect himself from
Miller whos leveling Harrys gun

He FIRES once missing Harry by inches Harry catches hold
of a ROPE underfoot and pulls it tripping Miller who
TOPPLES backwards into the mouth of the dragon The GUN GOES
OFF again the bullet BLOWING APART the dragons JAW
MECHANISM

Miller starts to sit up his body splayed between the
dragons steel teeth He has Harry in his sights

-- something CREAKS He looks up The dragons jaw is
closing FAST He starts to scramble to his feet Too late
The teeth SLAM CLOSED on his body Sudden death

Harry looks round to see Butterfield retreating into the
shadows Then hes gone Harry looks down at Millers

where illusionists are performing close-up magic for
audiences of well-heeled patrons Walter nods and waves to
half a dozen people on their way through the house up the
stairs and towards the bar

Are they all in the business

LAURA an Asian-American illusionist called BILLY WHO and
two of Vinovichs adoring courtiers an overblown
overdressed female illusionist - DEBRA DEVINE - and a thin
waspish fellow in a spangly suit the AMAZING QUENTIN

In the conversation that follows we go back to Harry
repeatedly as he studies this extraordinary group

VINOVICH
Its more than entertainment Were
opening peoples heads up Putting
miracles back into their boring
little lives
BILLY
But theyre fake miracles

VINOVICH
Houdini believed he had spirit
guides

HARRY

You believe that

VINOVICH
I think we walk a narrow path
between between

HARRY

Heaven and Hell

Vinovich stares hard at Harry trying to figure out whether
hes being sarcastic or not

VINOVICH
Trickery and divinity

fq

HARRY
Are you saying that sometimes
the miracles are real

VINOVICH
No Im saying they were always
fake The saints the messiahs
they were just illusionists

HARRY
So could you walk on water

VINOVICH
(deadly serious)
I could reproduce any miracle
thats ever been performed with a
little preparation

HARRY
What about Swanns miracles

The smug smile on Vinovichs face dies Furtive glances are
exchanged around the table Only Billy Who makes a tiny
smile

VINOVICH
They werent worth a damn

HARRY
(goading)
I heard he was the best

VINOVICH
If he was so good whys he so dead

Vinovich begins to look suspicious

HARRY
You tell me No I thought youd
maybe have a theory

VINOVICH
Oh Ive got plenty

HARRY
Id like to hear them

Vinovich rises

VINOVICH
Im not saying another word
(to Wilder)
You damn fool Hes a
journalist

Evil He was evil
(to Laura)
Come on

She rises

(to the rest)

EXT ST LUKES SANITORIUM PASADENA - DAY
ON THE ADDRESS BOOK in Harrys hands

Harry looks up - with some surprise - not at a house but at a
building the sign on which reads St Lukes Sanitorium

INT ST LUKES SANITORIUM - DAY

The place is bland and functional throughout the walls
decorated with sun-faded reproductions of great paintings
Nothing disturbing Harry is talking to DA TOFFLER -
black fortyish softly spoken - and a Nurse

TOFFLER
Jennifers only ever had one
visitor

HARRY
A Mister Quaid

TOFFLER
Right And hes dead isnt he I
saw it on the news Jennifer
doesnt know And frankly this
isnt the best tine for her to be
told

HARRY
I wont say anything

INT ST LUKES SANITORIUM - CORRIDORS AND WARD - DAY

Toffler excorts Harry through -the place There are
distressing scenes on every side Nothing melodramatic no
screaming no fits Just a subtle pervasive air of despair
Blank empty FACES in blank empty rooms

TOFFLER
Jennifers been with us four years
She was coming on nicely
But just the last month or so
shes worse than ever

HARRY
Whats her problem

TOFFLER
She has no real grip on reality

HARRY
(a joke)
Does anybody

TOFFLER
(deadly serious)
Oh yes We have to agree whats
real and whats not Thats what
holds us together

HARRY
And what does Jennifer thinks
real

Theyve come to french windows which are wide open Sitting
outside in the sun is Jennifer with her back to us

TOFFLER
(quietly)
Jennifer thinks the Devils coming
for her
(louder)
Jennifer

Jennifer turns She looks terrible
EXT ST LUKES SANITORIUM - GROUNDS - CITY STREET - DAY

Harry and Jennifer walk amongst the flower-beds with the
Nurse keeping a watch from a discreet distance Throughout
the scene we HEAR the SOUND of earth being dug which
steadily gets louder as they walk

JENNIFER
Have we met before

HARRY
No

JENNIFER
Only I forget They give me pills
you know to keep me even
and I forget things

HARRY

Well you didnt forget me I just
came because I wanted to know if
you knew a man called Butterfield

JENNIFER
Maybe I dont

HARRY
What about Philip Swann

JENNIFER
I knew Swann
(sudden vehemence)
Hes a fucking liar

A WORKMAN saunters past carrying pipes

HARRY
Whys that

JENNIFER
He said he knew how to protect us
But he didnt know anything He
made us think it was over and done
with

HARRY
What is
JENNIFER
(tears nearing)
I dont want to think about it If
I think about it hell hear me
Hell find me

HARRY
Swann

Ahead now the site where the workmen are digging a hole
laying pipes The CAMERA doesnt focus on this action but

were aware of it

JENNIFER
I told you I dont --

She stops Looks ahead of her Her face is suddenly ashen
and clammy Harry follows her gaze to

The hole Somebody is in it digging Earth emerges in
shovelfuls piling up beside the hole

JENNIFER (CONTD)
(screaming)
God no Oh God no

She backs away from the hole The Nurse grabs hold of her

NURSE
Calm down

She delivers the Nurse a backhand SWIPE The Nurse is flung
back

JENNIFER
Hes not going to get me

She races down towards the street Harry goes after her

JENNIFER (CONTD)
Hes not Hes not

HARRY
Whos not

He catches up with her

JENNIFER
Nix Nix

HARRY
Is he the Puritan

JENNIFER
Yes Yes

HARRY
And hes dead

JENNIFER
No Hes coming back Hes
digging his way out

The Nurse appears behind Harry

NURSE
Ill take care of her now

Jennifer struggles in Harrys grip

NURSE
Let go of her Mr DAmour

The Nurse breaks Harrys hold on Jennifer who slips away
instantly racing towards the street

HARRY
Jennifer

She scrambles up over a wall and flings herself from the
top Theres a SCREECH of brakes then the smashing of
metalwork and glass Harry gets to the wall before the
Nurse Hoists himself up onto it Looks down

HARRYS POV OF STREET

Jennifer is dead in the middle of the street beneath the
wheels of a car The DRIVER is out and yelling
incoherently

HARRY
Jesus

He slips back down the wall and leans against it

He looks towards the hole The Workman has stopped digging
His mud-encrusted hands emerge and for a moment before his
head appears the image is eerily like somebody climbing from
a grave Harry closes his eyes

HARRY
(very quietly)

HARRY
Youve done this before

BILLY

BILLY

Itll be something hokey
CLICK The door opens

BILLY
Houdinid been proud of you

INT MAGIC CASTLE - REPOSITORY - NIGHT

Undusted shelves piled high with manuscripts old books
posters in every direction

BILLY
(impressed)

and
Whoa

On the wall plaster LIFE-MASKS In glass cases the tools
of the great magicians KNIVES KEYS GUNS WANDS even an
IRON MAIDEN Billy is in awe He wanders around wide-eyed
while Harry scans the shelves The dialogue runs as they
investigate

BILLY
I hear Mrs Swanns quite a babe

HARRY
You heard right

BILLY
You ever been married

HARRY
Yeah She was killed in a car
crash Her lawyer was driving She
was filing for divorce

BILLY
Why

HARRY
My life was too weird for her

BILLY
(grinning)
I love weird

Harry has seen a small SIGIL carved onto one of the shelves

HARRY
Billy This was on Millers
forehead Any idea what it is

BILLY
Nope

Harry presses it The entire bookcase opens up CREAKING
BILLY
What did I tell you So fucking
hokey

Inside there is a small shelf On it FILES and PAPERS

HARRY
What have we got here
Ever-eager Billy steps into the recess And --
two spiked latticed gates close on his arm

Harry grabs the gates before they snap closed inches from
skewering Billys flesh and bone He keeps them open his
sinews straining

HARRY
Grab the files

Billy reaches in and pulls out a handful of the files As he
steps out of range Harry lets go and the gates close with a
CLANG

BILLY
Jesus

He slams the files down Hes trembling

BILLY
I could have lost my fucking hands

HARRY
That would have kept you out of the
Magic Circle
(he studies the files)
Which was presumably the idea
(a beat)
These are about Nix

Harry takes a sheaf of papers and hands them to Billy

HARRY
You go through these Go on

Reluctantly Billy does so Harry picks up a faded
PHOTOGRAPH of the doorway to Nixs HOUSE (with the sigil
painted on it) and BUTTERFIELD the child standing in the sun
There are other CULTISTS standing around And in the DOORWAY
-- a barely visible figure (and all the more intimidating for
that) - is NIX

HARRY
Wait a minute

He stares at the boys face The eyes are clearly different
colours

HARRY
Thats Butterfield
BILLY
(points to nan in)
doorway)
And whos that

ON HARRY staring at the ambiguous presence
ON THE PHOTOGRAPH of the shadowy figure

HARRY
At a guess The Puritan Nix

Billy picks up an ETCHING water-stained and dirty It shows
a horror we recognize a mans HAND pressed into the FLESH
of another mans HEAD

BILLY
Take a look at this

HARRY
(looking at it)
A Nix specialty

Billy is getting subtly spooked now He puts the etching
down and starts to go through others in the series We
glimpse them as he does so In one a MAN regurgitates a
serpentine form made of FLAME In another a MAN stares at
his own HAND which is STRIPPED OF FLESH There is no bone
beneath Only a form of solid blackness In a third we see
a HEAD with a slit in the middle of the brow emanating
DARKNESS

BILLY
I dont know any of these tricks

Harry studies the etchings

HARRY
(a slow burn)
Maybe theyre not tricks

BILLY
(mystified)
I mean theres no instructions--
(realizes what Harry said)
What do you mean theyre not
tricks

HARRY
What did Vinovich say Something
about walking a path between --
BILLY
Trickery and divinity Yeah he
says that all the time

HARRY
Thats because he knew Hed seen
these files and knew

BILLY
Knew what

Out of the corner of his eye Harry sees a motion between the
book-stacks Billy frowns Harry puts his fingers to his
lips Gestures for Billy to take cover Billy backs away
Harry slowly turns in the direction of the motion

Something eerily sepulchral is gliding between the stacks A
figure in a straight-jacket with his head bowed

Harry takes out his gun

Billy disappears around the back of one of the stacks Harry
goes after the apparition

The TRACK is completely silent

Suddenly the creature appears behind Billy It looks up
its face that of a psychotic burning eyes manic smile

It tears open its straight-jacket and reaches for Billy who
backs away

BILLY
Harry

Books tumble on top of Billy as he stumbles against the
shelves

BILLY
Where the fuck are you

Harry appears and puts his gun to the PSYCHOS head

HARRY
Okay Hold it right there

The gun goes through the Psychos skull as though its made
of smoke

Harry waves his hands through it Its completely ethereal

But its still terrorizing Billy
BILLY
(in mortal terror)
Get it off me

Harry glances around Sees a LIGHT flickering between some
books FIRES at it The light goes out The Psycho
vanishes Billy is left hyper-ventilating on the ground

HARRY
Hokey enough for you

BILLY
Im out of here man Are you
coming

Harry picks up a handful of papers from the Nix file

HARRY
Im coming

Billy is already out of the room For a moment Harry pauses
to look back at the other files sealed behind the spiked
gates

As he does so --

-- the proiector sparks into life one last time and the
Psycho appears --ROARING - at Harrys shoulder

HARRY
Ah shaddup

He FIRES at the projector a second time
On the GUN SHOT --

INT SWANNS MANSION- STUDY-- NIGHT-

Dorothea pours herself a drink while Harry spreads the
PHOTOS and the PAPERS from the repository on the table

HARRY
He was the real thing right

DOROTHEA
Swann said he could do stuff yes

HARRY

DOROTHEA
He could get into peoples heads

flattering lighting bathing the naked forms of Dorothea and

Dorothea appears behind him

DOROTHEA
Harry Wait

Harrys at the bottom of the stairs now Across the hall in
a passageway an eerie SILHOUETTE We can make out no detail
of clothing or face

HARRY
What the hell-

Suddenly the shadowy FIGURE comes at Harry A BLAST of
ENERGY bursts against Harrys face As it breaks against his
skin we see (for three frames or so) a glimpse of Harrys
skull

HARRY
(in pain)

Aah

Harry FIRES at the figure The shadows fold up around the
Stranger like an origami puzzle Hes gone

DOROTHEA
Its him Its Nix

Harry goes out into the passageway
HARRY
Valentin Get some lights on

As if in reply to the command a burst of vivid white FIRE
erupts behind Harry He swings round to see the Stranger
unfolding out of the shadows again defying physics and
physiology to do so The FIRE is at his feet like a serpent
writhing on the ground It comes at Harry Harry FIRES at
it but it comes at him faster still rising to burn Harrys
leg He retreats the FIRE racing after him He makes for a
door and flings it open Hes in --

INT SWANNS MANSION - CASKET ROOM - NIGHT

The FIRE follows him across the ground and STRIKES his hand
Harry drops the GUN Looks up to see the Stranger in the
doorway arm raised to will the fire-serpent on But then
he hesitates Harry glances round and sees that the
Stranger - whose face is still a dark smear - is staring at
the CASKET

HARRY
Somebody you know

Dorothea appears behind the Stranger Sees Harry burned and
sweating cornered against the casket

DOROTHEA
Oh my God

The Stranger looks round Harry snatches up the GUN
supporting his burned hand with -his good hand Levels the
gun at the Stranger The FIRE raises its head like a cobra

HARRY
Which goes first My face or
your heart

The Stranger draws a deep breath The Fire-Serpent withers
and dies

DOROTHEA
Who in Gods name are you

She reaches for the Stranger who simply folds up again gone
into darkness The WIND blows through the house masking his
exit

DOROTHEA
Are you all right

HARRY
Find Valentin Find him Get him
in here

Dorothea disappears Harry takes one of the candle-holders
and jams it under the casket lid Wood splinters He starts
to force off the lid

Valentin and Dorothea enter

VALENTIN
What are you doing This is
sacrilege

He starts towards Harry Dorothea goes after him and catches
hold of his arm Her expression is a mingling of fascination
and dread as Harry gets his fingers under the casket lid and
pulls

Inside Swanns corpse

VALENTIN
Are you satisfied now

HARRY
No

Harry holds Valentin back with one hand and puts his finger
into the corpses mouth

DOROTHEA
Harry

HARRY
Its all right Its not
hurting

He now has four fingers in Swanns mouth and seizes hold of
his lower jaw It cracks --

-- and comes away in a little rain of plaster and latex

HARRY
plaster doesnt bleed

He tosses the jaw to Valentin

HARRY
(to Dorothea)
It looks like youre not a widow
after all

INT SWANNS MANSION - STUDY - NIGHT
Harry interrogates Valentin in a white fury while Dorothea
binds Harrys hand

HARRY
You rigged the illusion to fail
right

VALENTIN
Yes

HARRY

You paid off the doctor You set
up the fake body Yes

VALENTIN
Yes

HARRY
And then because I was

getting too close to something --
(at Dorothea)
--or someone you called Swann

VALENTIN
I tried to pay you off

HARRY
Was that Swanns idea

VALENTIN
No It was mine I didnt want
any more bloodshed Thats why we
went to all this trouble so
thered be no one for Nix to come
after

HARRY
Nix is dead and buried for
fucks sake

VALENTIN
Havent you seen enough to know
that doesnt matter

ON HARRY He looks as though hes beginning to think maybe
Nixs resurrection is plausible

HARRY
I want to see Swann face to face

VALENTIN
Why dont you leave this alone Let
everybody think its over

DOROTHEA
What about me

VALENTIN
Nix was never interested in you
It was always Swann

A beat

HARRY
(to Dorothea)

let it alone

A BELL starts to TOLL-

barbed wire He peers through the bars

Harry slides out of sight Waits until the Stranger has gone
inside Then hes up over the gate braving the barbed
wire

concentration

HARRY
Be careful Funerals make me
trigger-happy

Swann stops inches from the ground

HARRY
You know its such a fucking
waste You can do shit most of us

around pretending its some trick

SWANN
Illusionists get Las Vegas

burned

Maybe hes digging his

way out of the hole you put him

hiding away from isnt it

I did it for Dorothea

HARRY
Oh yeah

SWANN
Now that Im dead the spotlights

Harry grabs Swann literally pulling him down to earth Now
theyre face to face Eye to eye Swann for all his
posturing is afraid

HARRY
So Nix wont come looking for her

SWANN
Its me betrayed him

HARRY
And she shot him I I think thatd
piss me off if I were Nix

SWANN
(despairing)
I dont know what else to do

HARRY
Help me

On Swann his face a churning mass of rage and fear

HARRY
Listen If hes back from the
dead then he is some kind of god
And hell find you wherever the
fuck you are
And if hes just another phony
Messiah then you can stage the
greatest come-back in history

public service It doesnt mean

HARRY

And youre not
Silence for a moment

SWANN
Oh I was going to discover the
secret of the universe Thats why
I liked Nix He promised me all
these explanations

HARRY
And he didnt have them

SWANN
He had something He showed me how
to bend the rules A little
levitation A few fireworks

HARRY

SWANN
No
(a beat)
At the end when we had him

cornered he got into my head He
showed me what we really look like
when the veneers gone Jelly
Shit

HARRY

SWANN
I saw it with my own fucking eyes
See thats his best trick No

stars

INT BUTTERFIELDS SEDAN - NIGHT

Valentin drives Butterfield and Dorothea are in the back
Dorothea is handcuffed

He has a bag open at his feet One by one he takes out a
series of extraordinary instruments Dorothea looks on
confounded

BUTTERFIELD
Like the look of these I made
them myself to set him free

DOROTHEA
Why did you wait so long

BUTTERFIELD
I didnt have the skill to
resurrect him I had to teach
myself And that took time

DOROTHEA
And you think hell be in a fit
state to resurrect after thirteen
years

DOROTHEA
What is he

BUTTERFIELD
Maybe hell show you

ON DOROTHEA terror in her eyes

EXT NIXS HOUSE - NIGHT

Now there are a dozen vehicles parked around the house
Through the windows the flickering of oil-lamp FLAMES

There is a low ominous CHANT floating from the house

It has no words but it is steadily BUILDING in intensity
We DRIFT towards the front door

INT NIXS HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - MEDITATION ROOM - NIGHT
Now we move down the passageway to the Meditation Room
Inside SEVENTEEN CULTISTS kneel in a circle They are all

CUTTING OFF THEIR HAIR and throwing it into the FIRE that
blazes in the centre of the circle They hack
indiscriminately with KNIVES SCISSORS and RAZORS their
eyes wild BLOOD runs down their faces and necks from nicked
ears and scalps

And still the CHANT BUILDS and BUILDS

NORMAN
He will come He will come He
will come

EXT DESERT - NIXS GRAVE - NIGHT
Wide A few rocks and emptiness

The headlamps of Butterfields sedan burn in the darkness
illuminating the dig Valentin is in the grave digging

ON Butterfield as he stands at the edge of the hole
watching the work Dorothea stands a yard or two behind him

BUTTERFIELD
Anything

VALENTIN (V0)
Not yet

Butterfield squats at the edge of the hole and suddenly
reaches out for Valentin hauling him close

BUTTERFIELD
If youve lied to me to me --

VALENTIN
I swear this is the place Swann
told me about The rocks

On Dorothea who uses Butterfields distraction to take a few
steps back towards the open car door

Dorotheas POV of Butterfield back to her interrogating
Valentin

BUTTERFIELD
Five more minutes Hear me And
youd better not --

A SOUND behind him Butterfield wheels round On the ground
beside the open car door the instruments

BUTTERFIELD
What the fuck are you playing at
He goes to pick them up Dorothea steps from behind the
door with the sharpest in her hand She slashes at him
Opens a WOUND across his arm

BUTTERFIELD
Aah

He comes at her suddenly striking the instrument from her
hand and slamming her against the car He hits her Once
Twice Then --

VALENTIN (VO)
Butterfield

Butterfield goes to the edge of the grave picks up the
flashlight and trains the beam on Valentin

VALENTIN
(blinded)
In the corner

The beam goes to the corner of the grave
A mummified HAND is sticking out of one of the walls
BUTTERFIELD
(to Valentin)
Keep away from it
Butterfield jumps down into the grave and goes to the hand
The TRACK is silent but for Butterfields shallow breath
He reaches out to touch Nix’s fingers
Closer

Closer

He touches the hand - and the wall of sand comes down with a
ROAR

He jumps back as Nixs corpse his head still sealed by the
mask rolls into view

VALENTIN
Oh Christ Oh Christ

BUTTERFIELD
(reverentially)

Its him its him

On Dorothea sliding down the car in despair
CUT TO

HARRYS MOVING POV OF THE GRAVE

Harry reaches the graves-edge Its totally dark He peers
in On his heel as the ground CRUMBLES beneath his weight
Harry slides into the grave

HARRY
Shit

Hes in darkness now He gets to his feet and starts to try
and scramble out

HARRY

Suddenly a hand is laid on his shoulder Harry swings
round Its Valentin He has been badly cut up

He puts his foot beneath Valentins body It rolls back into
Nixs grave

SWANN
Thats where were all going

HARRY
In my time and nobody elses

ON THE EMPTY GRAVE as we HEAR the SOUND of Harry and Swann
getting into the car The doors SLAM The CAR LIGHTS
retreat The grave is left to DARKNESS

EXT NIXS HOUSE - NIGHT

The house is silent now

INT NIXS HOUSE - PASSAGEWAYS - NIGHT

We TRACK through the house The CULTISTS all Seventeen of
them stand in the passageways looking toward Nixs sanctum

ON THE SANCTUM DOOR Butterfield emerges He is wearing
WHITE now

BUTTERFIELD
Do you wish him to be amongst us

CULTISTS
Yes

BUTTERFIELD
Will you come to him on your
knees

CULTISTS
Yes

BUTTERFIELD

Be ready
Now we see that the Cultists have BOTTLES in their hands
With looks of ecstatic fervour on their faces they SMASH the
bottles to the ground at their bare feet Then they pick up
MORE BOTTLES and SMASH them littering the ground with razor
sharp pieces of GLASS

ON Butterfield smiling He steps back into the Sanctum
INT NIXS HOUSE - SANCTUM - NIGHT

HIGH WIDE SHOT of the room as Butterfield approaches the
BODY of Nix It lies on a table surrounded by bowls of OIL
Bandages soaked in oil are laid over its limbs Beside its
head Butterfields INSTRUMENTS are laid out

ON Dorothea crouched in the corner of the room terrified as
she watches Butterfield remove the multi- part MASK screwed
into Nixs face He works with surgical precision

DOROTHEA
Listen Youve got everything you
want You dont need me

A piece of the mask comes away from the cheek A subtle
POWER plucks at dust around the room disturbing it minutely
We CUT CLOSE to Dorotheas face throughout this sequence (on
occasion her eyeball fills the screen) as she sees these
signs of disturbance in the ether growing in magnitude

BUTTERFIELD
No but he will After what you
did to him
He pulls a piece of the mask from Nixs mouth
BUTTERFIELD
Hell want vengeance Simple PS
that
INT NIXS HOUSE - PASSAGEWAYS - NIGHT

The bottle-breaking has ceased The Cultists stand
breathless with anticipation

INT NIXS HOUSE - SANCTUM - NIGHT
On Nixs emaciated mouth The lips TWITCH
On Dorothea The DUST moves around her

And Nix DRAWS BREATH
On Butterfield TEARS in his eyes

BUTTERFIELD
Oh my Lord Hes coming home

INT NIXS HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT
The whisper runs through the congregation

CULTISTS
Hes coming home hes coming
home

INT NIXS HOUSE - SANCTUM - NIGHT
ON Dorothea eyes wide

DOROTHEA
Christ in Heaven

ON Nix as his body starts to thirstily soak up the oils
His withered flesh starts to REHYDRATE his veins start to
THROB

Butterfield is watching the process in amazement Nixs HANDS
move up to his face where the last portion of the mask is
still screwed over his eyes

BUTTERFIELD
Hes with us

INT NIXS HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT

CULTISTS
Hes with us Hes with us

INT NIXS HOUSE - SANCTUM - NIGHT
Unnoticed by Butterfield who has his eyes on Nix Dorothea
gets to her feet and creeps away to the door Very quiet

TRACK

Suddenly the snake-handling Cultist steps into view snakes
coiled around his face and fingers

DOROTHEA
Oh God

Butterfield looks up

BUTTERFIELD
Hold her

On Nix as he starts to pull at the mask on his face It
comes away with a moist WRENCHING SOUND At last we see
his eyes

NIXS POV

The candle-lights blaze BLINDING his sensitive eyes

NIX
(fury to agony)
Aaarrrgh

He gets up and flings himself around the room knocking over
all the lights but two Then he strikes Butterfield to the
ground and slams his foot on Butterfields neck knocking
him unconscious Its a terrifying almost demoniacal
display of instant physical superiority Throughout he
literally ROARS in rage

INT NIXS HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT
The Cultists SCREAM in sympathy letting out years of
repressed frustration Many of them are dancing on the
shards of glass now crazed

CUT TO

EXT DESERT NEAR NIXS HOUSE - NIGHT

Harrys car is parked a quarter mile from Nixs house He is
getting out Swann stays put

The SOUND of SCREAMING is carried towards them on the wind

HARRY
(spooked)

Jesus what the hells going on
in there

SWANN
At a guess they just resurrected
him

HARRY
Fuck

Harry starts towards the house After a beat Swann gets out
of the car and follows

INT NIXS HOUSE - SANCTUM- - NIGHT
On Butterfield as Nix removes his foot Butterfield is out
for the count

On Nix as he stops screaming His face is grotesquely
disfigured by the mask the flesh stained and corrupted

The SCREAMING of the Cultists is dying away

NIX
Children

INT NIXS HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT

The Cultists all face the Sanctum door awaiting instruction

NIX
Will you suffer to come unto me

One by one the Cultists fall to their knees We never see
flesh pierced by broken glass But we HEAR IT and see the
agony on the Cultists faces They start to sob

Then Nix appears in the doorway mostly hidden by shadow

NIX

Ive come back to share the wisdom
of the grave Will you hear it

CULTISTS
Yes yes

NIX
Follow me then

He steps out of the doorway The Cultists let out sobs of
adoration Nix locks at Dorothea

NIX
Do I know you child

He reaches for her Pulls her close to his body Dorothea
keeps her self-possession but only just

NIX
Oh yes I do dont I No gun
this time child
(a beat)

Wheres Swann

DOROTHEA
I dont know where he is
Nix picks her up so that her feet are inches off the ground

NIX
Hell come Weve got unfinished
business he and I

Then he carries her down the passageway to the Meditation
Room walking on the glass apparently indifferent to the
wounds hes receiving

The Cultists follow
INT NIXS HOUSE - MEDITATION ROOM - NIGHT
Nix strides into the middle of the room

NIX
(whispered to Dorothea)
Something terribles going to
happen But if you hold on to me
very tight you may live a little
longer

The Cultists enter the room knees and hands BLOODY

NIX
(to Cultists)
Are you ready for my wisdom

CULTISTS
Tell us tell us

INT NIXS HOUSE - SANCTUM - NIGHT

Harry pushes open the window and climbs in Swann follows
He is frozen by the memory of what happened here

ON SWANN as the TRACK fills with eerie ECHOES of that
terrible event Nixs SCREAMS The GUN-SHOTS The sound of
the SCREWS GRINDING into Nixs flesh

SWANN
(in terrified awe)
This is where we killed him

HARRY
(looking at table)
You didnt try hard enough

SWANN
I cant I cant go any
further

Harry nods and gently detaches his arm from Swanns panicked
grip He crosses to the door

Suddenly Butterfield reaches out of the darkness and
catches hold of Harrys leg throwing him to the ground

He has one of the INSTRUMENTS in his hand He STABS at
Harry striking the ground between Harrys legs

INT NIXS HOUSE - MEDITATION ROOM - NIGHT

NIX
Here is my wisdom

He stamps on the ground CRACKS spread from his foot in all
directions ON THE CULTISTS amazed by this manifestation of
power

BARBARA
Show us Puritan

NORMAN
Yes show us

ALL
Show us Show us

With a ROAR a PIT four or five feet across opens up beneath
Nix and Dorothea Nix HOVERS over it Its utterly dark
perhaps bottomless

Dorothea SCREAMS

INT NIXS HOUSE - SANCTUM- - NIGHT

Hearing Dorotheas CRY Harry looks back towards the
passageway Butterfield pulls the instrument out of the

ground and stabs at Harry a second time But Swann catches
hold of his arm

SWANN
(to Harry)
Whatever hes doing to her stop

him
And Harrys up and away --

INT NIXS HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT
-- he dashes over the glass --
INT NIXS HOUSE - MEDITATION ROOM - NIGHT

On Nix Dorothea clasped close to him He REVOLVES as he
floats over the chasm below then

NIX
(to unseen Cultists)
You see I escaped the grave So I
have to give something to the grave
in return

On the Cultists listening to their lord with love in their
eyes

A SLIT OPENS in the middle of Nixs forehead above the
bridge of his nose (this is an image we saw in the prints in
the library) and from it comes a WAVE OF DARKNESS As Nix
REVOLVES the darkness STRIKES the GROUND around the
Cultists

At first they dont realize whats going on They think this
is some kind of bizarre blessing

Then the ground starts to LIQUIFY beneath them

NORMAN
Whats happening

NIX
I have to give something back So
Im giving you

Theyre starting to SCREAM now as they sink into the ground
They struggle of course but the earth seems to be hungry
for them They are dragged down THRASHING as they SINK

BARBARA
(sobbing)
Why Why
NIX

Youre not worthy None of you
Only Swann was worthy You just
waited like lambs

Harry appears in the doorway Nix still swinging round has
his back to Harry

NIX
Well Im not your shepherd
Harry surveys the horrific scene in front of him The ground
is now re-solidifying around the Cultists some of whom have
disappeared from view completely some of whom still reach up
out of the dirt The scene has a surreal beauty to it
despite its horror SCREAMING FACES locked in the solid
ground TWITCHING HANDS the same Harry starts towards Nix
and Dorothea GUN levelled So far he has avoided Nixs
gaze

INT NIXS HOUSE - SANCTUM - NIGHT

Butterfield and Swann are locked in a life-or-death struggle
They tumble back against the table upon which Nix was
resurrected It collapses under them and for a moment Swann
is stunned Butterfield snatches up one of the instruments
and STABS at Swann who rolls out of the way in the nick of
time

The BLADE catches him in the arm however

SWANN
Aah

BUTTERFIELD
Go on bleed
(he slashes at Swann
again)
Go on Go on

Butterfield comes after him and Swann backs off against a
wall He SPITS out a serpentine FLAME which races across
the floor and leaps at Butterfields face

BUTTERFIELD
(screaming)
No

He falls backwards his face ON FIRE Swann doesnt wait to
watch him die but races out into the passageway BLOOD
running from his wound

INT NIXS HOUSE - MEDITATION ROOM - NIGHT

Harry is staring up at Dorothea as he very gingerly crosses
the still-sticky ground Hes a yard from the edge of the
pit now

Nix swings round

NIX
Youre not Swann Who are you
(a beat) )
Oh I know what you want He lets
Dorothea slip from his arms

Harry flings himself towards the hole and CATCHES HOLD of
Dorotheas arm before she falls away into the abyss His GUN
goes spinning across the ground back towards the door
leading to the passageway

DOROTHEA
Oh God

HARRY
Hang on

Nix reaches down to torment Harry But before he can make
contact

SWANN (V0O)
Nix

Nix looks up

NIX
There you are

Suddenly Nix isnt interested in Harry and Dorothea He
steps onto solid ground and walks towards Swann his tone
suddenly conversational

NIX
Ive had a lot of time to think
about you Where I went wrong

With Nixs back turned Harry pulls Dorothea back out of the
chasm

SWANN
And

NIX
I should have been honest with you
right from the start I wasnt
born to show people the error of
their ways I was born to murder
the world

ON HARRY as he leads Dorothea to the door Harry glances
back into the room

NIX
You could still help me do that
SWANN
Why would I want to

NIX
Because youve got nothing else to
live for

SWANN
Not true

NIX
The woman has a new love in her
life Your friends are dead
Nobodys left to save you but me

He lays his hands on Swann Draws him into an embrace
ON HARRY and Dorothea

HARRY
(to Dorothea)
Ive got to help him

DOROTHEA
You cant

HARRY
Nix has got to have a weak spot
Everybodys got a fucking weak
spot

A NOISE He turns and suddenly --

Butterfield is there His face is horribly burned but hes
still very much alive

BUTTERFIELD
Bastard

He launches himself at Harry driving them both back into the
BROKEN GLASS A FIGHT ensues carrying them out into the
Passageway

Nix has Swann in a bear-hug

NIX
Will you help me

A beat Then Swann nods

SWANN
Yes
Nix lets him go
NIX

You know Ill kill you when were
done I have to

SWANN
Yes
NIX
But until then its you and
me the way it always was
SWANN
Yes

Dorothea at the doorway watches this bizarre exchange
Swanns eyes flicker towards her Nix turns

NIX
Wait you still feel something
for that bitch

SWANN
No

NIX
Liar

Nix makes a gesture and Swann is flung against the wall
pinned there like a fly legs off the ground

NIX
Will You Never Learn

With each word Nix almost casually throws a gesture in
Swanns direction and though there is six feet between them
they have the force of terrible blows One to the ribs
They CRACK One to the face It BLEEDS One to the legs
one to the arms They all BREAK Then Nix turns towards
Dorothea

NIX
Shes just flesh Swannnie-boy

Ill show you

He moves towards Dorothea Swann falls to the ground
broken

SWANN
Harry
INT NIXS HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT
The fight between Butterfield and Harry continues

SWANN (V0O)
Harry Stop him

Harry looks up Sees Dorothea retreating from the door and
running off into the darkness

Butterfield comes at Harry again Harrys got no more time
for this creep He delivers Butterfield a backhand swipe
and Butterfield lands face down in the glass We dont see
the impact HEARING its enough

Harry looks down at the body Then --

NIX (VO)
Where is she

Harry turns

Nix is on him like a luoaernaut treading on Butterfields
body as he comes at Harry

NIX
Where did she go

Nix GRABS hold of Harrys head with one hand and PRESSES the
fingers of -the other hand against Harrys TEMPLES He
struggles to get free but Nix is simply too powerful

Nixs fingers slowly SLIDE BENEATH the skin of Harrys
temples As before theres no blood

NIX
Youve got Swanns disease You
think a little courage a little
love and itll all be all right
Wrong

His fingers slide all the way in

HARRY
Oh God

Harry wrests himself free of Nix and stumbles away His eyes
are BLOOD-RED Nix is a few yards behind him

NIX
Tell me where she is and Ill
make it go away

Harry is reeling around in the grip of a nightmare
HARRYS POV

The apocalyptic images on the walls seem to move A face
SCREAMS FIRE blossoms

ON HARRY verging on insanity

HARRY
Oh God oh God

HARRYS POV
Harry sees a WOMAN wrapped in the sickly-sensual embrace of
some glistening barely visible OBSCENITY We cant see her

face Only her mouth is visible in the coils of her
devourer

ON HARRY

as he approaches the wall on which this woman is painted
Reaching out for the image

Harry turns around Dorothea is there
HARRYS POV

For a moment he sees Dorothea as she is

ON HARRY relief flooding his face Then --

HARRYS POV

-- the image MORPHS Dorotheas beauty is replaced by

primeval muck
ON HARRY appalled Dorothea grabs hold of him
DOROTHEA

Harry Listen to me Whatevers

Harrys face is deathly white and pouring SWEAT

fighting the delirium Or doing his best

HARRY

DOROTHEA

HARRY

Nix steps from the shadows of the doorway behind Harry

NIX
(to Dorothea)
There you are child

Harry starts to look round

DOROTHEA
Dont look

HARRY
I have to

NIX

Come on child I want Swann to
see you die

Harry turns and looks at Nix
HARRYS POV

Nixs face darkens as it MORPHS And the flesh in the middle
of his brow UNFOLDS revealing a dark pulsating THIRD EYE

NIX
(to Harry)
What are you looking at

ON DOROTHEA who has gone to the door of the Meditation Room
and now slips inside

ON HARRY staring up at Nix

ON DOROTHEA re-emerging from the Meditation Room In her
hand Harrys GUN Harry looks round at her

HARRY
(points to his brow)
There there

ON NIX as he looks up at Dorothea
ON DOROTHEA as she raises the GUN She FIRES
The bullet STRIKES Nixs FOREHEAD He sinks to his knees

BLOOD pouring down his face from the hole where his third EYE
used to be
ON HARRY as Nixs mind-hold falters He leans against the
wall shaking

DOROTHEA
Harry

HARRY
Im okay Im okay

Harry opens his eyes Looks up at her
HARRYS POV

The last of the MORPHING fades He sees Dorothea as she
actually is Dorothea goes down to comfort him and they
embrace

Suddenly a ROAR from Nix They look towards him --
-- it isnt over

One last terrifying transformation is overtaking Nix as he
kneels in the GLASS His sallow flesh is running in STREAMS
up his body towards the DARK HOLE in the middle of his
forehead --

NIX
One last illusion

-- his humanity is disappearing vanishing into the vortex of
the bullet wound

DOROTHEA
Oh my God

Harry and Dorothea start to get up

Nix is no longer human He is a shape of gleaming DARKNESS
stripped of features He opens his mouth the only visible
element on his body is his toothed maw which looses an
utterly inhuman SHRIEK

SWANN (VO)
DAmour

Harry glances through the door into the Meditation Room
Swann is on the threshold

Nix RISES now He is a terrifying spectacle his bulk
somehow more intimidating than ever in this simplified form
He comes at Dorothea who has no choice but to back away into
the Meditation Room

INT NIXS HOUSE - MEDITATION ROOM - NIGHT

The pit still yawns in the middle of the floor Dorothea is
backed towards it by Nix

When Nix SPEAKS his voice is not remotely human It is
DEMONIACAL

NIX
I am the purest of the pure I am
the darkest of the dark

Harry is at the door now starting towards Nix

SWANN
Harry You cant kill him

Harry crouches beside Swann
HARRY

(whispers)
He did something with the ground

SWANN
Yes

HARRY
Can you do it

SWANN
I dont know

HARRY

Try
ON DOROTHEA Shes a couple of yards from the pit now
NIX (VO)
Im beyond Heaven Im beyond

Hell

Suddenly Harry lunges at Nix grabbing hold of his legs
Nix topples

ON SWANN who puts his hands on the ground Closes his eyes

A wave of LIQUIFICATION runs through the ground from Swanns
broken fingers --
-- the Cultists bodies MOVE in the softening ground like
corpses in surf and ROLL towards the pit their dead faces
resurfacing --

Barbaras body floats past Nix and disappears over
the edge of the pit

HARRY
(to Dorothea)
Get out of here

The ground is very liquid now and the corpses are lodging
around Nix as theyre all carried towards the pit Sos
Harry of course

Nix tries to get up but hes too late The corpses weigh
him down the ground is too fluid for him to get a proper

hold and Harry still clings to his legs

NIX
No No No

Hes at the edge of the pit

DOROTHEA (V0O)
Harry

Harry looks round Dorotheas behind him risking the
flowing ground to offer him a hand

Nix starts to fall into the pit At the last minute he
reaches for Harry as --

-- Harry is pulled out of reach bv Dorothea

Together they stumble to THE DOOR where Swann still lies
They look back to see

NIX as he goes over the edge of the pit and FALLS SCREAMING

At the door Dorothea lifts up Swanns head Hes dead She
closes his eyes

CuT TO
INT THE PIT

What we are about to witness is the longest fall-to-his-—
death by any villain in the history of cinema
