CU A MODERN-LOOKING CHRISTMAS BOOK ENTITLED
ELF
A Christmas book entitled ELF sits ona
table a drawing of 62 BUDDY THE ELF (the
guy weve seen from all the trailers and
posters) is on the cover
We push in on the book and it magically flips
open to the first page a drawing of small
Papa Elf in his wonderful work shop
INT PAPA ELFS WORKSHOP - NORTH POLE - DAY
PULL OUT FROM THE BOOK TO REVEAL
The real life Elf and Workshop of the drawing
we have just seen PAPA ELF 540 years old or
roughly 55 in human years is surrounded by
scores of strange and specific tools and some
scattered half-built toys
PAPA ELF
So youre here for the
story Okay Just let
me wet my whistle
He pours himself a shot of milk in a snow-
flake shot glass and downs it
PAPA ELF
(like its
liquor)
Whoo Thats strong
Must be two percent
Elves love to tell
stories you probably

you Well theres a
lot of things about us

ysiologically
mpossible Heres

exactly the most
rewarding work

EXT ELF TREE - DAY

during dry season
We hear a yelp and now a siren rings and then
the TREE BURSTS INTO FLAMES ELVES SCURRYING
OUT
INT PAPA ELFS WORKSHOP - CONTINUOUS
PAPA ELF
But the third job
Well the third job
makes being an Elf
worthwhile Some call
it the show or the
big dance Its the
profession every Elf
aspires to And thats
to build toys in
Santas workshop
CUT TO
A TRACKING SHOT OF SANTAS WORKSHOP
The CAMERA whips by a crowd of bustling elves

of X-boxes being assembled
PAPA ELF
Its a job only an Elf
can do Our nimble
fingers natural cheer
and active minds are
perfect for toy
building Theyve
tried using Gnomes or
Trolls but the Gnomes
drank too much and the
Trolls werent toilet
trained
CUT AWAY
1) A drunk GNOME stein in hand vomiting
below the table 2) A TROLL wearing a diaper
is chewed out by an Elf cleaning up the floor
PAPA ELF
And no human could
ever do this work
Their hands are too
big and they tend to
get testy when over
worked In fact no
human has ever set
foot in Santas
workshop That is
until about thirty
years ago And in case
you havent guessed
it thats our story
It was back in 1968 A
particularly
successful

elbows
SANTA
Alright Vacations

The elves cheer and get back to work When an
OFF-SCREEN COOING is heard
SANTA

Sam Hill
More COOING Perplexed Santa looks down to
his bag just as a human baby dressed only in
a diaper crawls out and smiles

What do we do Santa
Santa looks befuddled
PAPA ELF (VO)
Santa had a decision
to make But
fortunately when it
comes to babies
Santas a push over
So Buddy would stay
with an older Elf who
had always wanted a
child but had been so
committed to building
toys he had forgotten
to settle down Yes
Buddy was raised by
me his adopted
father My how I love
that boy

PAPA ELF
And where do the
reindeers get their
magic from

BUDDY
Christmas spirit
Everyone knows that
PAPA ELF
Yes but
unfortunately
Christmas Spirit is
becoming a very
limited resource
BUDDY
What do you mean

PAPA ELF

(hard to break
the news)

Well Buddy as silly
as it sounds there
are a lot of people
down South who dont
believe in Santa
Claus

BUDDY
(shocked)

What Who do they
think puts all their
toys under the tree

PAPA ELF
Theres a rumor
floating around that
parents are putting
them there
BUDDY
Thats ridiculous
Theres no way parents
could do that all in
one night And what
about Santas
cookies I suppose
parents eat them too
PAPA ELF
I knowbut every
year less and less
people are believing
in Santa and today
weve got a real
energy crisis on our
hands See how low the
Claus-o-meter is
We see a gauge on the instrument panel of the
sleigh with CHRISTMAS SPIRIT LEVELS written
and a needle resting in the DANGEROUSLY LOW
red section
PAPA ELF
Thats why I installed
this little baby back
in the sixties
Papa pushes a RED BUTTON causing a JET ENGINE

father had fallen in
love when he was very
young with a beautiful
girl named Susan
Welles and how Buddy
was born and put up
for adoption by his
mother And how she
had later passed away
I told him his father
had never even known
Buddy was born And
most importantly I
told him where his Dad
was in a magical land
called New York City

DOCTOR
Its rare but there
have been documented
cases of people like
your son

feel he was never
fully nurtured
causing an alternative
personality to

develop

Yes

(beat)

I think hes trying to
return to a position
of child-like
dependency

So lets get him some
pills or whatever

I think what he really
needs is you This is
an extreme case A
rejection now could be
especially traumatic

So what do you want
me to do breast feed
him

What if you let him
visit you Meet the
family that sort of
thing It may help him
feel like hes a part
of your life
