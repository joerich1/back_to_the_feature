First

September 29

A BLACK VOID

We can hear movement Strange skittering sounds like
razor-claws on metal the hiss of pneumatic hoses
the whirr and click of servos liquid gurgling an
eerie alien cacophony

EARTH

appears hanging now in the starry blackness The
alien noises continue and far in the distance we hear
the muffled THUMP of what could be a distant explosion
Alien TEXT suddenly appears next to Earth and we
REVEAL we are in --

INT BORG RECON CENTER

The image of Earth is actually on a monitor which is
only one of DOZENS of MONITORS covering a huge wall
We dont see anything of the rest of the room but the
technology in view is distinctly alien and bizarre --
a mixture of organic and mechanical elements
Circuitry and optical cabling are side-by-side with
what looks almost like arteries and organs We can
still hear the creepy skittering and gurgling noises
Occasionally a SHADOWY FORM sweeps past the camera
vaguely humanoid but we cant tell who or what it is

All of the monitors are active and they present myriad
IMAGES and SOUND -- all related to EARTH HISTORY The
screens show everything from written Chinese to
Renaissance paintings to black and white newsreel
footage of World War Two to what look like clips of
space battles from the 24th century The entire range
of human history dancing across the monitors The
effect is dizzying -- we get the feeling that whoever
is watching this is studying the human race

There is another THUMP and the wall of monitors
SHUDDERS slightly We hear the VOICE of what we will
come to know as the BORG COLLECTIVE -- thousands of
voices speaking at once

BORG
Restrict search parameters to 1-9-
9-8 through 2-0-8-4

The images on the monitors now change to show us images
from 21ST CENTURY Earth history

Again its a collection of still photography video
footage text artwork etc We hear snippets of sound-
bites music speeches from the period A lot of
enticing details As the images race across the
monitors we should learn the following

-- The turn of the 21st century brought chaos
Regional wars the collapse of the United Nations
Societal break-down Crime starvation desperation

-- A Third World War Nuclear explosions
environmental disasters tens of millions dead The
United States ceases to exist All political authority
vanishes Humanity teetering on the edge of the Second
Dark Age

-- The image of a single man -- ZEPHRAM COCHRANE A
visionary scientist He see the spacecraft he created
out of a nuclear missile He flies the first warp
test breaking the light barrier It changes history

-- Grainy black and white images of a VULCAN SCOUT SHIP
landing on Earth They saw Cochranes flight followed
him back to Earth and made First Contact with the
human race

-- Humanity turns the corner First Contact with an
alien civilization brings the planet together as never
before Humans and Vulcans working together beginning
to solve long-standing problems with new technology
We see an early replicator producing food for the
starving millions A new World Government is formed

-- People from planet Earth and people from Vulcan form
an Alliance They call it the United Federation of
Planets And they commission a fleet of starships for
protection and exploration They call it Starfleet

-- These are images recounting the birth of the Star
Trek universe
Another muffled EXPLOSION this one stronger SHAKES
the entire wall One of the monitors BLOWS OUT ina
shower of sparks And now a new voice a womans
voice low threatening with a slight metallic
inflection speaks for the first time

WOMANS VOICE
Stop search Calculate temporal
coordinates J-Fourteen

Another explosion ROCKS the room and it takes us to

EXT SPACE - A BORG SPHERE

A huge spherical Borg warship as it takes a phaser
shot from an unseen vessel The BLAST smashes into the
Borg Sphere but the massive ship continues The
Sphere returns FIRE FOLLOW the Borg fire to --

A FEDERATION STARSHIP

locked in battle with the Borg Sphere The Borg fire
DESTROYS the Federation ship in a fiery blast

NEW ANGLE

as the Borg Sphere flies away from the wreckage of the
decimated starship and as it does we reveal that this
is just one small part of --

A MASSIVE SPACE BATTLE

involving dozens of Starfleet and Borg vessels engaged
in a fierce FIREFIGHT as far as the eye can see Ships

turning twisting firing exploding Lots of movement
Its a spectacular sight

The Borg Sphere is moving away from the battle heading
off in another direction

NEW ANGLE

In the middle of the battle A BORG CUBE is attacking
a smaller Federation starship The starship is taking
quite a beating explosions all along the hull it
doesnt look like it can take much more of this

Suddenly a spread of FOUR TORPEDOES come blazing in
from 0C The torpedoes SLAM into the Borg ship
causing massive damage

THE USS ENTERPRISE NCC 1701-E

SOARS into view and moves to protect the beleaguered
starship

The Enterprise is Starfleets newest and most powerful
vessel An elegant and majestic ship But unlike the
last Enterprise Starfleet has opted for a more
muscular vessel and the hull is studded with weapons
and other defensive armory We get the feeling this
Enterprise is ready for anything

INT ENTERPRISE-E - BRIDGE

The Bridge has been redesigned A single Captains
chair dominates the room and surrounding consoles and
stations all face inward instead of out giving Picard
instant access to his officers PICARD in the
Captains chair RIKER at a new Ops station DATA at
the helm WORF at Tactical TROI at Communications
various CREWMEMBERS at their posts The ship is at Red
Alert and everyone is tense

PICARD
Signal the Endeavor to fall back
Well cover them

TROI
Aye sir

She works her console

EXT SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE and BORG SHIP

The Endeavor moves off as the Borg FIRE at the
Enterprise and BLASTS the saucer section This should
also produce an unusual effect -- instead of the
traditional bubble shielding the new armor of this
Enterprise ABSORBS the blast and dissipates the energy
across the hull The ship is undamaged

INT BRIDGE

The ship is ROCKED by the blast

DATA
Dispersive armor is holding

PICARD
Bring us about Target Borg ship

WORF

Port battery ready sir

PICARD
Fire

EXT SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE

As RAPID PHASER SHOTS leap out from half a dozen points
along the ships port side (NOTE The phasers also
look different more along the lines of a gatling gun)
The Borg Cube EXPLODES The Enterprise flies through
the debris

INT BRIDGE

Including MAIN VIEWSCREEN which has a view of the
chaotic battle surrounding them Another Borg vessel
looms into view

PICARD
Starboard battery -- fire
EXT SPACE
The Enterprise fires a burst of phasers -- but this

time the phasers have no effect We see a strange
SHIELDING appears around the Borg ship

INT BRIDGE

On the main viewer the massive Borg ship looms closer

DATA
The Borg ship has modified its
shields Captain Our phasers
will no longer be effective

PICARD

INT MAIN ENGINEERING

Where GEORDI and ND Engineers are rushing about hard
at work Geordi is no longer wearing his VISOR -- he
now has artificial ocular implants for eyes They have
a distinctive electronic look to them

GEORDI
Captain Im starting to worry
about the hull integrity Weve
been running the support field at
full power for three hours
straight I dont know how much
longer its going to hold up

PICARD
Understood Keep me informed

Borg

PICARD

On screen

Data works and the viewer changes to a view of the
INTERIOR of the BORG CUBE A vast CHAMBER crammed with
HUNDREDS of BORG DRONES standing upright in individual
alcoves Theyre everywhere -- on the ceiling walls
floor This is a BORG COLLECTIVE -- hundreds of Borg
that form a gigantic hive mind The Borg are half-
manhalf machine No individual personalities No
feelings They have only one goal in life to
assimilate new races into their collective To become
a Borg is to experience living death When they speak
they speak as a collective -- thousands of voices
speaking as one

BORG
Your defense perimeter is
useless You will be assimilated

PICARD
(to Borg)
Break off your attack By now
you must realize you cant win

BORG

Your opinion is irrelevant We
are the Borg Resistance is

futile
PICARD
Well see about that
(to Worf)
Fire

Worf works

EXT SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE - CLOSE ON TORPEDO BAY

A QUANTUM TORPEDO BLASTS out of the launcher and heads
toward the Borg cube This torpedo is completely
different than the traditional photon torpedo It
oscillates and changes shape and color as it streaks
toward the Borg ship

THE BORG SHIP

as the quantum torpedo HITS IT But instead of
exploding on the surface the torpedo PIERCES the ship
like an armor-piercing shell and momentarily VANISHES
from view The ship then EXPLODES like a star going
supernova -- bright light and shock waves

INT BRIDGE

The ship is ROCKED violently by the shock wave People
hanging on

The viewer shows ADMIRAL HAYES on the Bridge of his
starship

ADMIRAL HAYES
The new quantum torpedoes are

doing the trick Jean-Luc Weve
destroyed forty-seven Borg ships
so far and only lost fifteen of
our own

(beat)
But one of the Borg ships has
broken through our defenses and
its heading directly for Earth
Can you handle it

PICARD
Absolutely

ADMIRAL HAYES
Good hunting Hayes out

PICARD
Mister Data set a pursuit course
Maximum warp

as it breaks away from the battleand races INTO
WARP

EXT SPACE - EARTH

There are Starfleet satellites and space stations in
close orbit The Borg Sphere seen before enters frame
The satellites open fire but they have little effect
on the massive Borg Sphere which returns fire
EXPLODING them in orbit

The Sphere heads down toward the Earth

Correction -- it is not in orbit
It is heading directly toward the
surface

PICARD

What

Picard gets up moves to Datas console

RIKER
(incredulous)
Some sort of suicide tactic

Unknown sir Suicide tactics are
not normally associated with the
Borg

Data reacts to his console

EXT EARTHS ATMOSPHERE

Just ahead of the Sphere we see a TEMPORAL VORTEX
opening -- a maelstrom of light and energy stretching
into infinity ENERGY explodes from the vortex as the

They did it they assimilated
Earth
WORF

But if they changed history
then why are we still here

DATA
We were caught in the temporal
wake from the vortex It must
have protected us from any changes
in the time-line

Worfs console sounds an alarm

WORF
Captain there are five Borg ships
closing in on our position

PICARD

Go to manual

Worf pops open a panel and a high-tech TARGETING console
emerges with a small MONITOR and a traditional CROSS-
HAIR in the center Worf grabs the targeting hand-
controls -- futuristic joysticks

EXT SPACE - THE BORG SPHERE

The ship is FIRING its weapons down toward the planet
as the Enterprise comes up over the horizon

In twenty-four hours Zephram
Cochrane is supposed to conduct
the very first warp test from
a missile silo in Montana If Im
right the Borg were trying to
change the course of human history
TO

by killing him or destroying his
ship

RIKER

(nods in understanding)
And if they succeed humans wont
make First Contact with the
Vulcans tomorrow

(beat)
As First Officer I should be the
one beaming down

PICARD
Normally I would agree But in
this case the mission requires a
certain knowledge of 21st century
history Youre many things
Number One but youre not much of
an historian

He grins slightly has to agree

RIKER
Good luck sir

EXT MONTANA PLAINS - MISSILE SILO - DAY

The SILO is buried deep underground but on the surface
there is a large poured concrete MISSILE DOOR

Built to withstand a nuclear blast the door has
nevertheless been badly charred and damaged by the Borg
attack from orbit There are large smoking CRATERS

all around Part of the ground seems to have COLLAPSED
to a depth of ten feet like a sinkhole nearby Picard
and his team approach

GEORDI
This must be it

PICARD
How serious is the damage

GEORDI
(off tricorder)
Im having trouble scanning
underground Theres a lot of
radiation leaking from something

PICARD
Probably from the nuclear warhead
Cochrane was planning to use it to
ignite the warp drive

As they speak Beverly pulls out a hypospray and gives
everyone injections

BEVERLY
This will protect us from the

radiation

Geordi moves to the thick concrete missile door scans

it

GEORDI
Im picking up faint life signs
twenty meters below

PICARD
There should be an access hatch
nearby
Everyone spreads out looking for the hatch One of
the guards -- LANGE -- finds it
LANGE

Over here

Everyone rushes over to him Theres a small HATCH on
the ground that has been partially hidden by weeds and
brush Geordi kneels down starts working a complex-
looking LOCK on the hatch

GEORDI
Alphanumeric lock We need a
password to get in

PICARD
I have the password right here

Picard pulls out his phaser and everyone steps back

He aims and FIRES at the hatch which is BLOWN OPEN

revealing a ladder that leads down into the darkness
As they start to crawl inside

INT MISSILE SILO - CONTROL ROOM

This is the mission control for Cochranes test site
The underground room is filled with 21st century
equipment consoles and monitors One entire wall of
the room is dominated by a huge METAL BLAST DOOR which
is now closed We will learn that on the other side of
that door is the nuclear missilewarp ship itself

The ceiling has partially collapsed Chunks of

concrete and fallen beams have destroyed some of the
equipmentOnly a few of the consoles are active most
are dark or fritzing sporadically The lights are out
and the room is illuminated by a few smoldering fires
Four dead bodies can be seen strewn around the room
Its a scene of destruction

PICARD
and his team ENTER the dark and smoking ruin Beverly

and Picard move to one of the dead men while Geordi
and the Security Guards move to the other three

Beverly rolls the man onto his back -- hes clearly
dead The name stitched on his uniform says Rippert
Picard looks up

PICARD
(to others)
See if any of these men are
Cochrane

Geordi and the Guards start checking the dead bodies

GEORDI
Mitchell DePaul
LANGE
This ones a woman named Kirby

Picard and Beverly move toward the immense blast door
As Beverly scans it Picard glances at a nearby desk

THE DESK

is littered with debris and various documents and
schematics THREE PHOTOGRAPHS are pinned to a bulletin
board above the desk -- they show Zephram Cochrane and
two angles of his warp ship The photos are odd-
looking printed on what appears to be some sort of
cloth

BEVERLY
Theres a life sign behind this
door about ten meters below

Geordi moves to the door

GEORDI
Blast door Its designed to
protect the control room when the
missile is launched

PICARD
There should be some kind of
manual release

They hunt around for a moment Geordi runs his hand
along the edge of the blast door Picard turns to the
Guards

PICARD
(to Lange)
Get those fires out and then try
to restore main power to the
control room

LANGE
Aye sir

The Guards move off

GEORDI
Got it Captain

Geordi has found an emergency BOX with several
pneumatic tubes and a hydraulic lever labeled
emergency use only He pulls down the lever there
is a hissing sound and the blast door slowly SLIDES
DOWN into the floor We can now see the MISSILE SILO
itself beyond the door Picard Geordi and Beverly
step into

INT MISSILE SILO - CONTINUOUS

Picard Geordi and Beverly step onto the catwalk which
surrounds the Silo walls In the middle is the WARP
SHIP itself It should look like an advanced ICBM
missile with a COCKPIT in place of the warhead and
with numerous modifications to the fuselage The
cockpit is on the same level as the control room On
the side of the missile is the name Phoenix The
missile itself extends down another FOUR STORIES
There are other catwalks below this one with ladders
connecting the different levels Beverly sees
something below

BEVERLY
There

NEW ANGLE

Two catwalks below we can see a man sprawled on the
grating They all scramble down the ladders past the
massive missile (NOTE Because of the design of the
Silo we will see the entire missile only in a few
shots For the most part our view is limited to
sections of the missile)

Beverly reaches the man who is lying face-down on the
metal grating She scans him

BEVERLY
Severe radiation exposure

Geordi looks over at the section of the missile on
their level The side panels have been removed
revealing complex circuitry within

Picard joins Beverly who turns over the injured man
Its ZEPHRAM COCHRANE -- the man whose picture we saw
on the Borg monitors Beverly begins pulling devices

out of her medkit injects Cochrane with a hypospray
Cochrane is a man in his mid-forties He has a
TO

youthful dynamic appearance marred by recent radiation
burns

PICARD
Its Cochrane

BEVERLY
Ive stabilized him for now but
hes in a coma and hes going to
need radiometric therapy I want
to take him to the ship

Picard nods reaches into his pants pocket takes out
a combadge

PICARD
Picard to Enterprise
(no response)
Enterprise please respond

GEORDI
It could be the radiation
Captain Try from the surface

Picard nods then takes a deep breath tries to
orient himself to the task at hand theres a lot at
stake and a lot to do He turns to Geordi

PICARD

Mister La Forge listen very
carefully If you remember your
history in less than twenty-
four hours a Vulcan ship will be
passing through this system When
it does this ship needs to be in
space flying at warp speed

Geordi takes a deep breath its a tall order

GEORDI
Id better get started

Geordi goes to work Picard bends down and carefully
hoists Cochrane up into a firemans carry Beverly
follows him up the catwalk

EXT MISSILE SILO - DAY

Minutes later Cochrane is lying on the ground
Beverly is kneeling beside him unfolding a portable
stretcher from her medkit Picard is checking two
combadges with a tricorder
TO

PICARD
Its not the radiation and
theres nothing wrong with the
combadges the Enterprise just
isnt responding

BEVERLY
Jean-Luc this man needs medical
attention now

PICARD
As I recall the town of
Resurrection is about two
kilometers East of here They
might have a hospital

Picard looks troubled at the thought

BEVERLY
What are we waiting for Lets
go

PICARD

It may not be that simple This
is an extremely difficult and
paranoid time in human history

BEVERLY
Are you saying they wont help us

PICARD
Im saying they might shoot us on
sight You have to remember
these people have watched their
entire way of life collapse around
them

BEVERLY
There must be some good people
even in this time

PICARD
Lets hope so Because if
Cochrane dies the future may

die with him

Picard kneels down and they begin to carefully put
Cochrane on the stretcher

INT ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE

Riker Troi and Worf studying a MONITOR which shows a
three-dimensional DIAGRAM of the Enterprise which

Cur
turns and

rotates as needed The schematic shows

battle damage and repair efforts

Worf nods

Just then

An ALARM goes off on Worfs console

WORF
I have assigned two damage control
teams to locate the source of our
communication problems So far
theyve had no success

RIKER
Assign another team if you need
to I want to re-establish
communication with the Captain as
soon as possible

and begins making notes on a PADD

TROI
Are we in any danger of being
detected by Earth defense systems

WORF
There were no planetary defense
systems in this era Their
weapons were designed to
fight each other not
extraterrestrials

RIKER

We have to start thinking about a
way to get home

(to Troi)
Analyze our readings from the
temporal vortex Were going to
have to recreate whatever the Borg
did to --

the ship SHUDDERS and the LIGHTS FLICKER

RIKER
Report
TROI
(off console)
We just lost main power and

weve got Class-Three alerts all
over the ship Im not sure
whats --

WORF
A ship-wide decompression has been
initiated

RIKER

He reacts to it

TROI
Were venting our internal
atmosphere directly into space

EXT ENTERPRISE

CLOSE ON THE SAUCER as vents and hatches POP OPEN on
the hull and GIANT JETS OF VAPOR start blowing out
into space

INT CORRIDOR

Crewmembers walking along are suddenly KNOCKED to the
floor as hurricane force WINDS blow through the
Corridor The ship is venting air into space creating
a virtual VACUUM inside the ship The people in the
corridor grab onto the bulkheads struggling to hang on
against the force of the wind

INT BRIDGE

Suddenly an emergency AIRLOCK on the Bridge OPENS
VIOLENT WIND roars through the Bridge and everyone
hangs on Troi is ripped out of her chair flown
across the Bridge slams up against the bulkhead
struggling to hang on Worf runs over grabs her arm
keeps her from flying out

Riker manages to reach a control panel -- hits a button
and an EMERGENCY BULKHEAD finally slides down over the
airlock and the wind DIES DOWN Everyone takes a beat

RIKER
What the hell is happening Worf

WORF
(off console)
It appears that someone has taken
over the Environmental Control

Room
TROI
Someone
RIKER
(realizing)

The Borg Some of them mustve
beamed over before we destroyed
their ship

(to Worf)
Seal off that entire deck with
emergency force fields

TROI

Wil Data was down there
RIKER
(to Worf)
Mister Worf find Data if you

can but your top priority is
isolating the Borg

WORF
Understood

Worf heads for a Turbolift OFF Rikers disturbed
expression

CUT TO

CLOSE ON DATAS FACE

His eyes are closed Theres a beat then his eyes fly
open and he looks around

We PULL BACK slightly revealing Data is lying on some
kind of tabletop with metallic clamps and restraints
He tenses his arm and tries to move but he is unable
to break the restraints About two feet in front of
his face is what appears to be a bulkhead There is a
cacophony of strange background NOISE -- scratching
hisses gurgling liquids odd alien hums

Suddenly the table begins to MOVE It ROTATES and as
it does so we realize that Data has been hanging upside
down staring at the floor Its a disorienting moment
as our perspective changes and Data rotates upright

DATAS POV

As the table gyrates we REVEAL the ROOM slowly And
we realize were in --

INT BORG HIVE

The Environmental Control Room seen earlier has now
been transformed into the INNER-SANCTUM of the BORG
The room has a dark moist organic feel -- a tropical
jungle of cybernetic equipment

The Borg are altering the room converting Starfleet
technology and materials into the living bio-
mechanical look of the Borg We see one Borg drone
attach a small pod to a Starfleet console and activate
it The pod immediately sends out a COMPLEX WEB of
BORG TECHNOLOGY which covers the Starfleet console
inside and out Its like weeds overpowering a flower

bed -- within seconds the console has been BORGIFIED

The walls ceiling and floor are now honeycombed with
the ALCOVES that make up the BORG COLLECTIVE Borg
drones are motionless in their alcoves cabling and
other conduits connecting them to various equipment
while other Borg are moving about the room carrying
out various modifications to the room At one point
we see Ensign Porter Hes been completely Borgified
His skin pale expression blank No hint of humanity
left

DATA

still strapped to the table which is twisting and
rotating giving him frightening new glimpses of the
room A new image appears -- SIX BORG DRONES are
clustered together in one section of the room each
with an elaborate series of hoses and conduits
connected to its face

Through the tubes we can see an exchange of FLUID and

ENERGY pulsing back and forth -- some sort of bizarre

feeding or renewal is going on The tubes all seem
to lead toward the ceiling

Data is now horizontal on his back and the table LOCKS
into position A Borg drone OPENS A PANEL on the side
of Datas head and begins connecting a thick bundle of
optical cabling to it

DATA
(to Borg)
Your efforts to assimilate me will
be unsuccessful

The Borg ignores him activates a console and the
cabling connected to Datas head LIGHTS UP with power
Theyre trying to connect him to the Collective

Data thinks for a moment tilts his head slightly
and then suddenly theres a SHOWER of SPARKS from the
cabling hes been connected to The lights on the
cable go out Data has thwarted their attempts

DATA
(to Borg)

It would appear that resistance is
not always futile

Suddenly a new VOICE is heard echoing through the room --
a womans voice low seductive deadly

WOMANS VOICE
Brave words Ive heard them
before from thousands of species

TO

across thousands of worlds
since long before you were
created

Data looks up toward

THE CEILING

A RUSTLE of MOVEMNET somewhere in the cyber-tangle
almost like a snake slithering beneath the weeds And
for a brief instant we get a glimpse of a FACE unlike
any Borg weve ever seen The face of a woman Pale-

skinned piercing eyesraven hair slicked back
a hauntingly beautiful image in a sea of nightmarish

technology And then its gone

DATA

Frowns He saw it too but hes not sure what to make
of it

WOMANS VOICE
But now they are all one with
the Borg

DATA
I am unlike any lifeform you have
encountered before As an
android I am in complete control
of my neural net The information
contained there cannot be forcibly
removed

WOMANS VOICE
You are an imperfect being
created by an imperfect being
Finding your weakness is only a
matter of time

Suddenly three Borg drones converge on Data with
various wicked-looking Borg devices One of the Borg
has a specialized cybernetic ARM which EXTRUDES a
series of stiletto-tipped DRILL SPIKES As the six-
inch spikes begin to BORE INTO Datas head

EXT MONTANA - RESURRECTION CITY - DAY

Resurrection is a small town -- around 1000 people --
a rural Western community thats probably existed for
at least two hundred years and we can see the roots of
the original ranching community in some of the

architecture But its also a community of the 21st
century

The most striking feature of the town is that it sits
in the middle of nearly a hundred WIND MILLS which
provide the only source of power for the town The
blades are enormous but the structures supporting them
are little more than simple poles Some are sleek
fiberglass futuristic others have a more cobbled
together make-shift appearance At the moment only

a few blades are turning in the gentle breeze

Picard and Beverly emerge from the nearby woods
carrying the stretcher They exchange a look at the
sight of the city and then head toward it

EXT RESURRECTION CITY - DAY

A few minutes later Picard and Beverly carrying
Cochrane down the street toward the hospital at the
end As they walk along we get our first taste of
post-apocalyptic 21st century life

This is a recognizable American community but its
definitely a futuristic town Clothing architecture
technology -- all have changed over the course of
seventy years But it is a broken future What used

to be high-tech public COMPUTER TERMINALS are rusted
and abandoned We can see the corroded hulks of HOVER-
CARS lying idle in the streets Futuristic elements
now useless

At one point they pass a large polyurethane TENT --
the inside surface is covered with condensation and we
can see the silhouettes of people moving within The
entrance is guarded by a single Militia Guard Later
we will learn that this is a primitive greenhouse the
only place where they can grow uncontaminated food

What used to be a McDonalds or some other
recognizable food chain has now been gutted and has
been turned into a kind of blacksmith shop People are
fashioning metal into various tools using hammer and
tongs

The sidewalks are populated with PEOPLE who congregate

in small groups quietly talking amongst themselves
others just staring vacantly off into space Many of

them have visible burn scars and damage to their bodies --
victims of the war and post-nuclear environmental

dangers A few of them are applying a special lotion

to their arms and face -- protection against the toxic
elements A long FOOD LINE snakes around a block as
people line up to get their daily rations

A few people glance up at Picard and Beverly with
TO

curious or suspicious looks This is not a community
that welcomes strangers At one point they see a man
dressed in futuristic CAMOUFLAGE carrying an automatic
weapon -- we will learn hes a MILITIA SOLDIER He
stares at them with a neutral expression then walks
off

The people here have that hollow-eyed listless look
about them Theyre going through something that makes
the Great Depression look like a minor inconvenience
But theres also a toughness to these people a
resilience and determination to survive in the face of
overwhelming odds We are looking at our future and
its on the verge of collapse

Cur

INT HOSPITAL - EMERGENCY ROOM - DAY

A short time later Cochrane is being lifted onto an
operating table Picard and Beverly step back from the
table as a DOCTOR and two NURSES look him over The
doctor is in his early fifties and has a weathered

tired look to him The hospital itself is like the

rest of the town -- a futuristic setting fallen on hard
times The light in the room is provided mostly from

the sunlight streaming in through the windows Light
bulbs and other gear flicker dimly around the hospital --
we get the feeling they have very little power

DOCTOR
How long has he been unconscious

BEVERLY
At least four hours

He checks Cochrans head injury as Beverly takes out
her tricorder and scans him

DOCTOR
It looks like he has a cranial
fracture but Ill need X-rays to
be sure
(to Nurse)
Get Ruby in here

One of the nurses runs off

BEVERLY
(off tricorder)
He has a severe fracture of the
left occipital plate Hes not
hemorrhaging but the radiation
has damaged his KNA and his APR
cell count
He looks at her curiously

DOCTOR
APR cell count What the hell
are you talking about

PICARD
(quickly)
Doctor Crusher has been
studying some advanced medical
theories

NURSE
(re tricorder)
What is that

BEVERLY
Its a new medical scanner
Its a little more precise than an
X-ray machine

The Doctor eyes it

DOCTOR
Is it Japanese

BEVERLY
Um yeah
(beat)
Now hes going to need a
respirator Do you have one

DOCTOR
We have two but we dont have
the juice to run them

PICARD
Juice

DOCTOR
Power There hasnt been a lot of
wind through here for the last
couple of weeks Most of the
batteries are depleted

BEVERLY
Dont you have any generators or
other fuel sources

The Doctor throws her an irritated look

DOCTOR
Maybe youd like to take your
patient to the hospital in
Bozemen its only two hundred
miles away

Cochrane wheezes -- breathing becoming labored and
ragged Beverly scans him urgent

BEVERLY
His automatic reflexes are
fluctuating Weve got to get him
on a respirator

DOCTOR
(to Nurse)
Bag him
The nurse picks up a portable respirator sack -- puts

it on Cochranes face and squeezes the bag forcing air
into Cochranes lungs Picard has been thinking
through this scene finally has a solution

PICARD
Beverly -- your tricorder

She hands him her tricorder

PICARD
(to Doctor)
Wheres the battery room for the
hospital

DOCTOR
I told you theres no --

PICARD
Where

DOCTOR
Outside around back Next to the

water tank

Picard rushes out the doors Beverly checks Cochranes
pulse

BEVERLY
His heartbeats irregular

Beverly climbs up on top of Cochrane straddling him
begins giving him 24th century CPR She takes charge

BEVERLY
Adrenaline -- ten CCs

As they rush to save him
EXT HOSPITAL - DAY

The back of the building Picard rushes out and spots
an old dilapidated BATTERY UNIT providing power to the

hospital He quickly yanks off the back panel
revealing a tangle of wires and several large
batteries He kneels down then removes the back of
the tricorder

CLOSE ON TRICORDER

as Picard pulls out a small POWER CELL -- about half
the size of a dime The blinkies on the tricorder go
out

PICARD

holds the power cell with one hand and starts pulling
out wires from the batteries with the other

INT HOSPITAL - EMERGENCY ROOM - DAY

As before Beverly the doctor and the nurse trying to
save Cochrane

BEVERLY
(pumping his chest)
One two three compress

The nurse squeezes the bag Suddenly the room is
filled with the HUM of POWER and ALL OF THE LIGHTS AND
EQUIPMENT COME TO LIFE Monitors blinking fluorescent
lights flashing on Everyone reacts with shock

INT HOSPITAL WARD - DAY

Its filled with patients The lights and equipment
here FLASH ON as well Doctors and patients alike
react with surprise

INT HOSPITAL - EMERGENCY ROOM - DAY

Picard enters Theyve placed a RESPIRATOR down
Cochranes throat and attached electrodes to his
chest Beverly has just finished giving him an
injection with a hypospray The heart monitor in the
background is now beating regularly The doctor turns
to Picard

DOCTOR
What did you do to the batteries

PICARD
Oh just a little tinkering
How is he

BEVERLY
Hes stable for now
(with meaning)
But it would be better if we could
contact our friends

PICARD
Yes But until then youll have
to make do with what youve got

BEVERLY
Thatll be interesting

A WOMANS VOICE

RUBYS VOICE
What happened to him

Everyone turns

NEW ANGLE

revealing RUBY SLOANE standing at the front of
Cochranes bed A striking woman in her mid-to-
thirties -- dark hair tall lean beautiful und
normal circumstances but at the moment shes not
best it looks like shes just come in from a ha
days work Shes wearing an old lab coat But t
most striking quality of all is the innate inte
we can see in her eyes

Shes looking directly at Picard for an answer
realizes he has to say something He looks into
eyes and there is a moment here -- a brief spar
chemistry that in normal circumstances the Capta
might follow up But at the moment he shoves t
electric feeling aside and tries to give her an

PICARD
There was some kind of explosion
out at the missile silo

She looks at him for a moment her eyes boring i
without expression as though probing the truthf
of his statement

She looks up at Picard and again theres a slight
feeling of chemistry in the air And then she turns
and starts to walk out of the room Picards combadge
BEEPS Reactions

GEORDIS COM VOICE

Picard takes a few steps away pulls the combadge out
of his pants pocket taps it Ruby watches him a beat
then walks out of the room

PICARD
Picard here

GEORDIS COM VOICE
Captain we have a problem I
think youd better get back here

PICARD
Im on my way Picard out

Picard moves to Beverly

PICARD
(sotto)
I have to go back to the silo
Will you be all right

BEVERLY
Ill be fine
(re Cochrane)
Hes a different story

Beverly begins examining the medical equipment shell
have to work with as Picard exits

EXT RESURRECTION CITY STREET - DAY

A short time later Picard walking down the main
street back toward the gates People passing him
taking no notice of himPicards mind thinking
ahead He happens to glance down a side street then
he stops

NEW ANGLE

Looking down the side street Ruby the mysterious
woman from the hospital is walking along with a camera
bag now slung over her shoulder She stops for a

moment as she passes the hulk of a burnt-out old hover
car stares at itthen pulls a home-made

FUTURISTIC CAMERA out of her bag and snaps a picture of
the car She continues on her way Picard is

intrigued -- wonders about this woman and what it is
she could be taking a picture of Just then --

MANS VOICE
Catch

Picard turns just in time to catch a small metal
canister with a screw-top

The man who threw it steps into view Its LIEUTENANT
SCRIMM Scrimm is the head of the towns militia
While not a physically threatening man there is a
quietly disturbing quality about him which conveys an
intelligence laced with a tightly reined volatility
Hes wearing futuristic combat fatigues and always
carries a sidearm Before the war Scrimm was probably
one of the survivalists who used to be dismissed as
radicals until their predictions of Armageddon came
true At the moment Scrimm is presenting his
friendliest face to Picard

SCRIMM
(pleasant)
Think youll need that

Picard eyes the canister not sure what to make of it

SCRIMM

Its no zone solution
(off his look)

You know No ozone

He points to the sky

PICARD
Oh yes ultraviolet
protection Thank you
Mister
SCRIMM
Lieutenant actually Lieutenant
Jonathan Scrimm Im the head of
the Resurrection Protective Force
(beat)
And you are

PICARD
Jean-Luc Picard

SCRIMM
Great name French

PICARD
Yes

SCRIMM
You dont sound French

Scrimm is still smiling at him but his eyes never
leave Picard

PICARD
I was raised in England and here
in the States Thank you for
the no zone

Picard begins to walk away not wanting to engage any
citizens of the town Scrimm falls in next to him

SCRIMM
Where in the States

PICARD
Oh here and there You know
how it is

SCRIMM

Not really I was born and raised
right here Never had much use
for travel

He casually steps in front of Picard blocking his way

SCRIMM
Where are you from most recently

PICARD
(thinking fast)
California San Francisco

SCRIMM
Beautiful city Used to be
anyway I didnt think anyone
still lived there
PICARD
Theres a few of us left

Picard steps around him and continues walking down the
street Scrimm waits a beat then walks after him
again

SCRIMM
That was a pretty clever trick you
did with the hospitals batteries
Howd you do it

PICARD
It wasnt a trick I used to be
an electrical engineer

SCRIMM
Huh

He steps in front of Picard again still pleasant but
a little bit of a smile fading from his face Picard
realizes he isnt going to shake this man so easily

SCRIMM
And what were you doing out at the
missile silo

PICARD
Im an old friend of Cochranes
I wanted to see how he was doing

SCRIMM
Lucky for him you came by when you
did He might be dead now

PICARD
Yes

SCRIMM
Maybe you can tell me what hes
been doing in that silo We heard
some explosions out there this

morning

PICARD
I think he was running a test on
an old rocket engine and one of

the fuel cells burst

Scrimm eyes him evenly

SCRIMM
You seem to have an answer for
everything

PICARD

Something wrong with that
TO

SCRIMM
Not yet

A tense beat Then Scrimm smiles easily

SCRIMM
(re balm)
Be sure you put that on You need
a lot of protection around here

He holds Picards eyes for a moment

PICARD
Thank you But Ive never had
much trouble protecting myself

Now its Picards turn to smile pleasantly at Scrimm
Picard walks around him and heads for the gates
Scrimm watches him go with a thoughtful expression --
clearly hes more than a little suspicious

CUT
EXT SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE
in orbit of Earth
INT CORRIDOR
Worf and a large SECURITY DETACHMENT -- a dozen or so
men and women -- are moving down the Corridor with grim

looks on their faces They are carrying new powerful-
looking phaser rifles and other equipment The feeling
is of an elite combat squad heading for a dangerous
mission They stop at one point and Worf lifts up a
DECKPLATE exposing a large HATCH in the floor Worf
hits his combadge

WORF
Worf to Bridge Were in
position

INT BRIDGE

Riker in command Troi nearby Riker is standing at

the security station looking at a monitor which
displays a schematic graphic of the ship The position
of the security team is flashing -- we can see they are
on Deck 46

RIKER
This is the Bridge Im releasing

the emergency force fields
He nods to Troi who works a console

INT CORRIDOR

Worf and his team watch as the FORCEFIELD protecting
the hatch flashes off Worf reaches down and releases
the hatch which slides open with a soft whoosh He
glances at his men for a moment then JUMPS down the
hatch

INT DECK 47 - CORRIDOR

As Worf lands on his feet The light is dim no power
on this deck hard to see He looks around warily for

a moment phaser at-the-ready then activates his wrist
beacon We immediately notice that we can see Worfs
breath -- its freezing cold down here He shines the
light around the darkened corridor then silently
motions his arm for the others to follow A beat then
we see the security officers start to drop into the
corridor from the hatch above

NEW ANGLE - CORRIDOR

As Worfs squad spreads out along the hall weapons at-
the-ready everyone alert with fingers on the triggers
We see that the phaser rifles are equipped with their
own light sources intended to illuminate the target
before you shoot at it The Security Officers are
constantly moving their lights back and forth through
the chilly air Worf gives hand signals -- holds up

two fingers then a fist and points forward

Two Guards trot down the corridor about fifteen feet
stop and take up firing positions then two more
members of the team run down leap frog ahead of them
and take positions further down the corridor Classic
military deployment Worf starts scanning with a
tricorder

WORF
(hits combadge)
Worf to Bridge

RIKERS COM VOICE
Riker here

WORF
Theres a dampening field in place
on this deck Our tricorders are
useless

The team continue to explore Deck 47 Its spooky
eerie a sense of menace around every corner They
open doors check room by room section by section
still no sign of the Borg in the freezing cold
darkness

ANGLE ON SECURITY GUARD

The Corridor directly ahead has been stripped of wall
ceiling and deck panels -- all the normal decorative
Enterprise sheathing is gone revealing the circuitry
and machinery of the ship itself Unlike the rest of
the corridors there does appear to be POWER flowing
through some of the conduits up ahead and it gives off
an eerie glow

We can also see that some of the machinery has been
altered and changed -- not just the neat and orderly
arrangement youd expect to find behind bulkheads --
theres a sense of cross-circuitry re-wiring
equipment being rearranged Clearly a lot of work has
gone on in this area of the ship Worf steps forward
examines the corridor closely

ENSIGN HAWK
What the hell is going on

WORF
Borg

Worf signals the team forward and they slowly begin
picking their way down the Borgified Corridor Its

not easy -- they have to choose their footing carefully
as they walk through the maze of cables circuits and
machinery Ensign Hawk accidentally steps on some

circuitry which gives off a BEEP The entire team
suddenly whirls their lights and weapons on the
unfortunate Ensign who pales at their sudden attention

Worf looks irritated then motions his team to continue
their search They continue making their way down the
spooky corridor and as they turn a corner

NEW ANGLE - ANOTHER CORRIDOR

where the machinery is now THICKER and more BORG-LIKE
in appearance Tubes and cabling hang down from the
ceiling If anything its even colder in here The
deeper they go the worse it gets We can now hear a
low sinister HUM of alien power At the end of this
corridor is the ENVIROMENTAL CONTROL ROOM as seen
earlier The entire doorway is gone -- and a weird
pulsing GLOW fills the room Worf stops his team at
the sight From this vantage we cannot see directly
into the room but clearly something is going on in
there

Worf signals his men to spread out and they take up
positions around the Corridor all weapons trained on
Environmental Control

WORF
Worf to Bridge Were about to
enter the Environmental Control
Room

RIKERS COM VOICE
Any sign of Data or the Borg
themselves

As Work and Riker continue talking we MOVE TO Ensign
Hawk who is now the last man in the formation
covering the rear Hes shining his phaser-beacon into
the empty darkness He cant help looking back over
his shoulder at the rest of the team and the distant
Environmental Control Room -- that seems to be where
the action is As he turns his beacon moves with him
throwing the Corridor behind them in and out of
darkness

WORF
(continuing)
Negative However theyve
reconfigured the ODN network
and re-routed all power on this
deck into Environmental Control

As Worf speaks Ensign Hawk turns back but this time

when he shines his beacon into the darkness something
MOVES in the distance -- a shadow The Ensign freezes
brings his rifle up But did he see it or was it his

imagination

A tense beat as he waits heart pounding but nothing
happens On the wall next to his head we see what can
only be described as a BIO-MECHANISTIC CABLE creeping
out of the wall which begins slowly heading for the
Ensigns neck Just as he begins to sense that
something is happening behind him the cable WHIPS OUT
around his neck and YANKS him deep into the bed of
circuitry in the blink of an eye -- the motion so fast
we have trouble following it

Worf turns his head at the sound

WORF
Stand by Commander
(to team)
Wheres Ensign Hawk

Everyone looks around surprised that hes not there
Everyone is alert keyed up The tension is thick

Utter silence except for the hum of the machinery and
the frosty breathing of the team

RIKERS COM VOICE
Worf Is something wrong

WORF
Something is very wrong
Commander Were falling back

Worf gives hand signals for the team to move out But
just as they start to fall back everything happens at
once

BORG DRONES

EXPLODE OUT OF THE WALLS CEILING AND FLOOR What
follows is a BLUR of action happening so fast and
furious we never get a true sense of whats happening

A flurry of violence and motion and images

-- A snarling Borg face -- half-human half-machine a
cybernetic nightmare

-- Strange bio-mechanical WEAPONS extruding from Borg
bodies RIPPING into human flesh

-- A crewmember PULLED into a bed of machinery

WORF
Fire at will

But the Borg are already on top of them Its a brutal
fight in close quarters with no escape

Phasers and Borg lasers lighting up the corridor
bodies flying through the air utter chaos and
terror The fight goes hand to hand and Worf sees that
they dont have a chance

WORF
(throwing off a Borg)
Fall back

The team starts backpedaling FIRING as they gobut
the Borg are unstoppable now -- they put up personal
force fields to protect themselves

WORF
Go go GO

Worf pushes his men down the corridor Everyone turns
and RUNS like hell Worf bends down and grabs a
frightened Lieutenant by the collar pulling him along

VARIOUS SHOTS

-- The team running through the corridors SHOOTING
behind them at the pursuing Borg to no effect

-- Two of the Borg raise their arms and FIRE LASER
BURSTS out of their arms and wrists taking DOWN two
Security Guards Worf sees them fall but theres no
time to go back

INT DECK 46 - CORRIDOR

As Worfs team starts CLIMBING UP and out the dark
hatch in the floor seen earlier

INT DECK 47 - CORRIDOR

As the last member of Worfs team climbs out to safety
The Borg swarm is about to overpower Worf He quickly
hits a few controls on his phaser sets it to overload
We hear the building WHINE He JUMPS straight up into
the air GRABBING onto the hatch rim pulling himself
up He barely manages to vanish from view just as the
phaser EXPLODES in a FIERY BLAST taking out several of
the Borg drones

INT DECK 46 - CORRIDOR

The conclusive BLAST comes up through the hatch
causing Worf to duck for a moment

Worf reaches out to close the hatch when a BORG HAND
bursts up from below and GRABS his forearm Its a
test of strength Worf reaches over with his other
arm hits a control and the hatch SLIDES CLOSED
SEVERING the Borg arm in a shower of sparks

WORF
Worf to Bridge -- force fields

The force field FLASHES into place Worf and his team
sit there a moment catching their breath stunned at
what theyve just been through

RIKERS COM VOICE
What the hell happened down there

INT MISSILE SILO - CATWALK - DAY

Geordi and Picard are walking down the catwalk ladders
toward the missiles massive engines Now that the
smoke has cleared and the place has been cleared up a
bit we get our first good look at the ship and the
damage done in the Borg attack

GEORDI
(on the move)
Cochrane was going to use this
solid rocket booster to lift the
ship into orbit Before the warp

drive took over everything
would depend on these old chemical
engines

(beat)

Now heres the problem

They arrive at a point on the fuselage where we can see
a large section of the engines have been BLASTED AWAY
leaving a deep ugly SCAR -- broken conduit lines
wires that now lead to nothing Its clear that a key
piece of equipment has been destroyed

GEORDI

(re damage)

This used to be the throttle valve
assembly
(observing it)

It controls the thrust of the
engines Its been completely
vaporized and without it
theres no way to launch the ship

PICARD
Can you reconstruct the throttle
valve

GEORDI
Yeah if I knew what it looked

like Theres probably five
hundred ways to design a valve
like this

PICARD
We need to launch this ship in
under eighteen hours
(beat)
There must be some design
schematics blueprints

GEORDI
Were tearing this place apart
looking for them but the
computers are down and the fires
destroyed half the filesso
far nothing

They look at the damage in frustration
GEORDI
If it was just part of the warp
drive Id know what to do But
this its like trying to
rebuild Orville Wrights airplane
with canvass and sticks

Picard thinks remembers something

PICARD
Wait a minute

INT CONTROL ROOM

Moments later Picard and Geordi are looking at the

three cloth-printed photographs seen earlier -- the
headshot of Cochrane and two different angles of the
three cloth-printed photographs seen earlier -- the

warp ship with people working on it Picard spreads
them out on the desk

GEORDI
Yeah I looked at these already

Geordi points to a photo of the ship -- a worker is
walking in front of the throttle assembly blocking
most of it from view

GEORDI
You can almost see the throttle
assembly in this one but this

guy walked in front of it when
they took the picture

Picard considers absently sticks his hand in his
jacket pocket He pulls out the canister of balm
Scrimm gave him and tosses it onto the table

PICARD
Could you reconstruct the throttle
from a photograph like this if

that man wasnt blocking the view
Geordi thinks it over
GEORDI

Maybe
(beat)
TO

Sure Yeah As long as I could
get a clear look at the intake
configuration But so far we

havent found any other photos

PICARD
(staring at photos)
If there are other photographs
I think I may know how to find
them

INT BORG HIVE

Its a while later and the Borg are making progress

Data is strapped to the table PANELS open on his HEAD
and CHEST Three Borg drones are working methodically

on his inner-circuitry The jagged voice of the woman

cuts in

WOMANS VOICE
Your resistance is illogical
To us your neural net is simply
another piece of technology We
will learn its secrets

Data stares at the murky ceiling

DATA
Who are you

WOMANS VOICE
I am the Borg

DATA
That is a contradiction The Borg
act as a collective consciousness
There are no individuals

WOMANS VOICE

I am the beginning the end I
am the one who is many I am the
Borg

Out of the mist that hugs the top of the room DESCENDS
the BORG QUEEN

She is unlike any of the Borg drones weve ever seen --
a humanoid female with conduits and tubes running out
of her body She has no legs Her torso is SUSPENDED
by a complex rig of CABLES and HYDRAULICS Her face

and upper-torso are much more humanoid with the pasty-
pale white of Borg flesh Her EYES have a silvery

glint to them Her demeanor is seductive and sensual

Cur
in contrast to the harsh mechanical surroundings She
is an eerie blend of two worlds -- organic and
mechanical

With the soft HISS of hydraulics she LOWERS herself
down to where her face is very close to that of Datas
Her features are almost angelic but the silvery glint
in her eyes betrays an inner-darkness

DATA
You are the guiding intelligence
behind the Borg

BORG QUEEN
Intelligence ambition
desire I bring order to

chaos
She studies his face with a certain child-like quality

BORG QUEEN
Its unfortunate we will have to
destroy you to obtain the
information we need You are a
unique lifeform

(beat)

Synthetic and yet far more than
a simple automaton
You have no idea how close to
perfection you are

She stares at him intently and we get the hint that
her interest in Data may go beyond simple assimilation
She seems fascinated by him Data picks up on this

DATA
How do you define perfection

The Queen opens her arms slightly clearly indicating
herself

BORG QUEEN
A blending of the organic and the
synthetic The highest form of
life in the galaxy

Data eyes her considering

DATA
An interesting definition But it
is not one that applies to me I
am completely artificial I have
no organic components

She looks at him as a new thought crosses her mind
She mightve just found the chink in Datas armor

BORG QUEEN
Have you ever wondered what its
like to have flesh

DATA
It is impossible to imagine
sensations for which I have no
frame of reference

She smiles

BORG QUEEN
That can change

The Queen looks to the three Borg drones and gives them
a silent command The drones immediately stop working
on Datas open panels and shift their attention to
his right ARM One of the drones tears off the sleeve
on Datas uniform exposing his bare arm Another then
uses a small cutting device to SLICE OFF the synthetic
skin from Datas arm As Data prepares himself for the
worst

INT ENTERPRISE CORRIDOR

THREE armored SECURITY GUARDS with phaser rifles run
into view hit a control panel on the wall A giant
EMERGENCY BULKHEAD comes SLAMMING down cutting off the
rest of the corridor

The security guards turn to run down the hall but then
there is a high-pitched shriek of wrenching metal
They drop to the deck and take combat stances

GUARD 1
Set phasers to rotating
modulation

They make adjustments to their weapons just as the
bulkhead doors EXPLODE INWARD in a blinding flash The
guards shield themselves against the fire and debris
looks up just in time to see the swift and lethal
shapes of the BORG jumping through the smashed
bulkhead racing down the corridor toward them The
guards FIRE and when they do the PHASER BLASTS
alternate color -- red blue green purple orange --
a staccato of colors as the phasers shift frequency

The phaser blasts TAKE DOWN a few of the BORG but
then we see the distinctive PERSONAL FORCEFIELDS of the
other Borg begin to compensate and the phasers no
longer affect them

GUARD 1
Thats it theyve adjusted --
fall back
TO

They turn to run but BORG PHASER FIRE lances out from
the Borg soldiers and RIPS them apart

INT BRIDGE

The mood is tense grim Riker Worf and Troi are
gathered around a SCHEMATIC of the ENTERPRISE The
lower portion of the ship has been blocked off by
the color RED representing the Borg advance through
the ship A they watch another section of
compartments and corridors suddenly turn RED

Riker lets out a wary breath starts pointing to
various points along the schematic

RIKER
All right weve lost control of
eight decks three Cargo Bays

one Shuttlebay

TROI
Do we have any idea how many Borg
were dealing with

WORF
We saw at least thirtyand
there are twenty-two Enterprise
crewmembers reported missing
including Commander Data

RIKER
Well have to assume theyve been
assimilated into the Collective

TROI
Even Data

WORF
Datas positronic net contains
classified information on the
Enterprise Command codes
security protocols

RIKER
If they control Data they control
the ship
A grim beat
RIKER

We cant worry about that right
now Lets concentrate on what we
can
They stare at the schematic

WORF
To control the Enterprise theyll
have to gain access to one of two
locations Main Engineering or
the Bridge

RIKER

We have to cover both
possibilities

(to Troi)
Well take care of the Bridge
Worf take your men and seal off
Main Engineering Turn it into a
fortress -- nothing gets in

Worf nods and EXITS As Riker and Troi exchange a
tense look

103 EXT RESURRECTION CITY - HOSPITAL - NIGHT

The hospital is completely LIT UP -- the only building
in town with this much power
104 INT HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Picard walks down the hall stops outside a door marked
X-RAY PROCESSING The RED LIGHT is on above the
door but that means nothing to Picard who opens the
door and steps inside
105 INT X-RAY PROCESSING ROOM

Much like a traditional darkroom trays of chemicals
and washes etc But everything has a slightly
futuristic and cobbled-together feel They are
developing X-rays by hand instead of by machine The
room is lit with an AMBER glow As soon as Picard
opens the door we hear Rubys voice

RUBYS VOICE
Shut that door

Picard quickly shuts the door behind him looks around
the room Ruby whos working at a tray of chemicals

turns around in fury

RUBY
What are you an idiot Didnt
you see the red light was on

PICARD
Ah yes but I didnt realize
that --

RUBY
Thank God this plate was already
fixed

She pulls down a small pane of glass (probably froma
window) out of a tub of water holds it up to the
light And there on the glass is a X-RAY of a mans
SKULL Picard moves to her

PICARD
(re X-ray)
Cochrane
RUBY
Yes and I only had enough

silver halide for one shot So
youre lucky you didnt screw it
up

PICARD
Im very sorry

She glances at him sees he feels genuinely bad She
softens a little

RUBY
Dont worry about it

She picks up a rubber squeegee and carefully starts to
dry off the pane of glass

RUBY
Did you need something

PICARD
Yes I wanted to ask you about
some photographs I saw out at the
silo There were three of them
printed on some kind of fabric

RUBY

Bed sheets

(off his look)
I used my last set of bed sheets to
make those prints Not the best
material but I havent seen a
clean piece of paper in five
years

PICARD
Did you take any other pictures of
the rocket

The X-ray is now dry and Ruby turns and looks at him

RUBY
Sure
(jokingly)
Why did you want to buy them

Picard doesnt realize she was kidding -- jumps on the
opportunity to get the photos

PICARD
Yes I dont have any money right
now but I may be able to get
some

Ruby looks at him for a moment -- is he serious She
gives him a curious smile

RUBY
Money So you can get dome
money

PICARD
I can try

RUBY

Youd have to try real hard No
ones used currency in over ten
years What are you from another
planet

Picard hesitates smiles at her tries to laugh it off

PICARD
No but sometimes I feel that
way
(beat)
What I meant was Id be willing
to trade for the photographs

RUBY
Trade Okay The photographs
for a straight answer

(beat)
Who are you And how do you know
Zephram
PICARD
Im an old friend I met him

when he was doing his
undergraduate work at Cornell back
in --

RUBY

(cuts him off)
Fraid not

Ruby walks past him with the X-ray

INT HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

Picard follows Ruby out into the corridor She has a
satisfied smile on her face -- its not easy to put one
over on this woman And the truth is shes enjoying
Picards frustration As they walk along

PICARD
What
RUBY
(casual)
Youre lying
PICARD

What makes you say that

RUBY
Youre not someone who lies very
easily so its obvious when you
do at least to me

PICARD
Are you always sucha good judge
of character

She stops turns looks at him

RUBY
Always

Ruby turns and walks off Picard follows her doggedly
determined to get those photos

INT HOSPITAL - EMERGENCY ROOM - NIGHT

Beverly is holding the X-ray glass Ruby made up to the
light as the Doctor seen earlier looks on

BEVERLY
The occipital fracture is
widening were going to have

to fuse the bones

DOCTOR
Im a little worried about some of
these bone fragments If they
move any closer to the brain we
could be looking at a hemorrhage
As Beverly and the Doctor examine the X-ray we MOVE TO
Ruby whos looking down at Cochrane Hes still in
bed and on a respirator She smoothes his hair with
affection Picard stands on the other side of the bed
watching her

PICARD

Were the two of you involved
RUBY

No not like you and Doctor

Crusher used to be

PICARD
(surprised)
How did you know about that

Ruby looks at him with a smile

RUBY
I didnt

Her smile widens and then she leaves the bed to join
the Doctor and Beverly Picard shakes his head and
smiles after her -- chagrinned and amused at the same
time

RUBY
(to Doctor)
We cant take any more X-rays
until I can mix up a new batch of
the silver halide

DOCTOR
Can you do it tonight We may
have to operate

RUBY
Sure Itll be ready by morning

Ruby turns and heads for the door Picard moves after
her

PICARD
Ruby I need to talk to you
about those photographs Its
very important

RUBY
Im sure it is But itll have to
wait until tomorrow

PICARD
It cant wait until tomorrow

RUBY
Too bad
(beat)
Besides itll give you all night
to think up a new set of lies

She flashes him that smile again then darts out the
door Picard is left frustrated -- he knows that he
cant let it go at that

108 INT ENTERPRISE - ENGINEERING

Worf and a team of TEN SECURITY GUARDS are preparing
for battle Theyre setting up large heavy-duty
phaser equivalents of machine guns -- big mean-looking
weapons on tripods There are two of these weapons
aimed at each entrance to Engineering The Security
Officers are strapping on body armor checking weapons
building makeshift barricades over each of the doors
Worf is in command directing the action
WORF
(to team)
Double check each assault
phaser make certain that the
range setting is no more than
thirty meters We dont want to
blast through the hull
Worf turns and picks up his BATLETH SWORD off a nearby
console He checks the sharpness of the blade
SECURITY OFFICER
Are you sure you dont want
something a little more
sophisticated sir
WORF
Mind your post Lieutenant
The Lieutenant decides not to pursue the matter and
moves off Worf makes a quick practiced motion with
the sword decides hes ready

display a cutaway view of the ship highlighting

representing the Borg is advancing on Engineering

Worfthe Borg are approaching

Understood Were ready

Riker and Troi watch as the DOTS move closer
closerright up to the perimeter of Engineering
The dots begin surrounding Engineering -- which looks
like its being swarmed over by a sea of ants

INT ENGINEERING

As before The security guards have taken positions
around the room all weapons trained on the doors

Worf is standing in front of the warp core Batleth in-
hand

WORF
(calls out)
Charge weapons

A massive HUM of power fills the room as all of the
phaser weapons begin charging Its tense -- everyone
standing ready with their weapons charging This is
the moment of truth

Worf stands ready phaser in one hand Batleth in the
other This is Worf at his purest -- the warrior ready
for battle

INT BRIDGE

Riker and Troi as before watching the schematic of
the ship The DOTS representing Borg have now
completely surrounded Engineering on all sides
including the deck directly above and below In
essence the Borg have cocooned Engineering from the
rest of the ship

INT ENGINEERING

As before Worf and the security team in their
positions tense A few beats of silencethen they
start to hear soft SCRATCHING coming from somewhere
behind the walls -- it sounds like rats skittering
through the walls and ceiling of an old house

Everyone stays alert checks and re-checks their
weapons a couple of hard swallows then from
somewhere up above a LOUD METALLIC CLANG Then a
large SCRAPING SOUND that seems to start at one end of
the room and travel to the other Theres an
overpowering sense of creatures just outside those
walls moving about Its unnerving even for crack
Starfleet troops

113 INT BRIDGE

Riker and Troi watching the display The Borg dots
teeming around Engineering like ants on a candy bar

114 INT ENGINEERING

The clawing skittering clanging noises increase and
get louder

we expect to see the Borg bursting into the room at
any moment Worf tightens his grip on his Batleth
teeth bared Unbearable tension and then

The noises begin to FADE AWAY eventually
disappearing all together If anything the silence is
even scarier Worfs eyes narrow He looks around the
room all his senses alert waiting for the slightest
sign of the Borg but nothing happens

115 INT BRIDGE

Riker and Troi react to the diagram as the Borg dots
begin moving away from Engineering It looks like the
swarm of ants have left the candy bar and are on the
ground moving toward the forward part of the ship

116 INT BORG HIVE

CLOSE ON DATAS FACE His eyes are closed -- he is in
the android equivalent of sleep CAMERA ROTATING and
PUSHING IN on his face as we hear the overlapping
sounds of VOICES from Datas past -- Picard Riker
Troi the Enterprise crew aliens hes met Datas own
voice bits and pieces of his life
The theme of the sound bites should be Datas quest for
humanity Picard giving him advice Troi counseling
him Soong talking to his son etc The last line of
dialogue we hear is Data saying I want to be more
human

BORG QUEENS VOICE
Data

Datas eyes fly open now awake We PULL BACK
revealing that Data is still strapped to the Borg
operating table his right arm and shoulder are
encased in some kind of strange cybernetic SHELL
obscured from view Clear tubes run out of the shell
into Borg machinery -- liquid is coursing through the
tubes A couple of Borg drones are moving about the
room carrying out various tasks

Theres been a change since weve been here last

There are now several Plexiglass CYLINDERS surrounding
Datas table -- each of them filled with some kind of
murky red fluid which is swirling around Every once
in awhile something that looks like RAW FLESH bumps up
against the clear Plexiglass then disappears again

We dont know what these tubes are for but theyre
definitely creepy

Data takes all this in but there is nothing he can do
hes still immobilized

Suddenly the table ROTATES and begins to MOVE up toward
the mist and cabling at the top of the ceiling It

stops a few feet away and Data finds himself face-to-
face with the Borg Queen again

BORG QUEEN
Youve taken your first step
toward perfection How does it
feel

DATA
I do not know what you are
referring to

BORG QUEEN
Thats because you havent been
properly stimulated yet

A WHOOSH of hydraulic power signals another movement by
the Borg Queen She slithers through the air and down
slightly so that she is on the same level as Data

She looks at the cybernetic shell that is encasing
Datas right arm which OPENS at her silent command and
moves away

We can now see that all of the skin has been removed

from Datas right arm showing the INNER-WORKINGS of
his android limb -- circuitry and servos etc But on
the top of the mechanical forearm there is something
new -- a small PATCH of HUMAN FLESH held in place with
various nasty-looking hooks and clamps and small tubes
carrying blood Its a delicate fragile piece of
organic life on an ugly mechanical surface

Data looks down at the patch of flesh with a little
puzzlement

BORG QUEEN
(re flesh)
Do you know what this is Data

DATA
It would appear that you are
attempting to graft organic skin
onto my endo-skeletal structure

BORG QUEEN
What a cold description for
such a beautiful gift

She smiles slightly utterly confident She leans her
face in close to Datas still immobilized right arm

EXTREME CLOSE UP - DATAS ARM

We are so close to the patch of flesh that we can see
the individual hairs The Borg Queens LIPS move into
frame and she EXHALES a long and sensuous breath We
see GOOSE BUMPS form on the skin and the hairs stand
straight up in response

NEW ANGLE

As Datas eyes widen and he looks down at the skin in
surprise -- this is a sensation hes never felt before
The Borg Queen sees the look on his face and smiles

BORG QUEEN
Was that good for you

Data can barely describe the sensation But clearly
it was pleasurable

DATA
It was interesting
He looks at her
DATA

Do it again please
As she smiles

119 EXT RUBYS HOUSE - NIGHT

A tiny single-story house -- one or two rooms at the
most in serious need of repair and maintenance No
yard The house sits on dirt The nearest other
structure is at least a hundred yards away A very
solitary place The windows are dark painted over
from the inside

Some large pieces of exotic-looking EQUIPMENT are
sitting off the front porch

After a beat the front door opens letting out a soft
feeble light

Ruby steps out onto the porch carrying a gallon size
plastic jug The light from the house now lights the
equipment a little giving us a better view Theres

a contraption that appears to be a PUMP of some kind
with a funnel on top spigot at the bottom and several
stages of filters and tubing in between Ruby sets the
jug underneath the spigot then sits down for a
moment on the edge of the porch She takes a breath
and runs a hand through her hair stretches her back
trying to work out some of the kinks in her neck An
exhausting day

120 PICARD

is watching her intently from afar Hes concealed
behind a supporting beam of one the towns many
WINDMILLS Hes in shadow hidden from Rubys view

121 RUBY

pulls off her jacket shes wearing a pull-over
shirt and in one motion she pulls off the shirt
revealing only a tee-shirt underneath sleeves torn off
long ago She stands up kicks off her boots
undoes her pants and begins sliding the jeans off
her hips

122 PICARD

is surprised Glances around a little awkward This
really isnt why he came out here

RUBY

kicks aside the jeans Shes now down to tee-shirt and
panties She grabs the bottom of the tee-shirt
pulls it off

PICARD

doesnt want to look but cant help himself

RUBY

moves to the side of the porch and steps into a
large ENVIROMENTAL SUIT a bulky one-piece with gloves
and helmet attached

PICARD

is a little relieved keeps watching

RUBY

has now encased herself in the thick rubbery suit
pulls over a HELMET with a gas mask She walks over to
an OIL DRUM marked with a distinctive BIO-HAZARD
SYMBOL She carefully opens the lid takes a metal
pitcher reaches down into the drum and scoops out a
pitcher-full of TOXIC WASTE She closes the lid walks
over to the pump-filter contraption She pours the
sludge-like waste into the funnelprimes the pump
makes a few adjustments to the filters and then
turns the spigot

After a beat a trickle of CLEAR LIQUID starts to come
out of the spigot Ruby steps back and pulls off the
helmet

PICARD

watches curious about what shes doing

RUBY
is now out of the bio-suit again pulling on her
shirt and jeans grabs her jacket turns off the

lights in the house and shuts the front door behind
her She begins walking toward the windmill

PICARD

steps behind the girder stays very still in the
shadows waits quietly as Ruby passes by the windmill
without a glance and heads into town After shes

gone Picard steps out from his hiding place watches
her go then quickly heads for Rubys house

FRONT PORCH

Picard opens the front door and goes inside but he
doesnt notice that at the base of the doorjamb a small
RED LIGHT starts flashing -- some sort of silent alarm

INT RUBYS HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Picard ENTERS and closes the door behind him Its
dark He fumbles around for a light switch finally
locates one and a soft golden glow fills the room

The house has only one room which functions as a
living room kitchen bedroom etc This is also
Rubys DARKROOM The windows have been painted black
and there are photographic plates and futuristic photo-
equipment all around But the most striking feature of
the house are the large hanging cloth-printed
PHOTOGRAPHS They vary in size and shape Some are
hanging on walls others hang from the ceiling in mid-
air still others are stacked on the few pieces of
furniture thats here The absence of paper has forced
Ruby to print photos on anything she can find --

bed sheets shirts pieces of upholstery backs of
carpeting etc Picard stands there for a moment
taking in the scene -- hes never been in anyplace
quite like this The cloth photos give the room a
feeling of a small intensely personal gallery

Picard moves around the room looking from photo to
photo hunting for the elusive shots of the missile
silo and as he does we get our first close look at
Rubys images and they tell us a great deal about
her

She has an artistic eye for finding beauty in the
mundane and the ugly There are pictures of hope
amidst despair beauty amongst devastation There
seems to be a theme running through the photographs --
a romantic almost idealistic sense of optimism

At one point Picard finds a photograph he recognizes
Its the rusted-out hover car she photographed on the
streets of Resurrection Its an ugly decrepit piece
of junk but there in the center spot-lighted by a
single ray of sunshine is a tiny flower about to
bloom

Picard takes in the image for a brief moment then
pushes onward goes to a file of photos sitting ina
box begins sorting through them quickly we see
PRE-WAR photos printed on real paper They show a
younger Ruby with her parents Resurrection the way
it used to look Ruby with a dog

Picard pauses frowns gets the odd feeling that
someone is watching him He turns around to see

HIMSELF

A three foot PHOTOGRAPH OF PICARD is drying in the air
behind him

Ruby mustve taken the photo when Picard was on the
street talking to Scrimm It was taken through a
telephoto lens a close-up of Picards face -- he looks
focused determined heroic Its a remarkable shot of
the Captain and even Picard is a little taken aback by
the image Shes captured the essence of the man

CLICK-CLACK The sound of a shotgun being cocked
Picard freezes slowly turns around to see whos
there

RUBBY

is standing in the open doorway a shotgun leveled at
Picard

RUBY
You should pay closer attention to
those little red lights

Picard glances down at the doorway sees the flashing
red light in the doorjamb Hes busted

RUBY
You know Id be perfectly
justified in shooting you right
now

Picard glances at the photograph of himself

PICARD
Id say you already have

RUBY
Dont flatter yourself I take
pictures of a lot of junk

She perches herself on the arm of a small couch holds
the gun loosely but never taking the aim away from
Picard
RUBY
Okay lets hear it Im sure you
have a great explanation for why
those rocket photos are so
important you broke into my house

PICARD
Were trying to repair Doctor
Cochranes ship Its been
damaged and --

RUBY
We

PICARD
Myself and a few other friends
of Zephrams

RUBY

Friends from Cornell

PICARD
Some

RUBY
Lie Thats one Keep going

PICARD
A key piece of the ship has been
destroyed and our only hope to

reconstruct it is if one of your
photographs shows us what it
looked like

RUBY
(considers)
All right Truth I believe that
one Why is it so urgent you
couldnt wait until morning

PICARD
We have to launch his ship by
tomorrow afternoon

RUBY
Or

Picard has to come up with something -- decides to
throw her off with a high-tech explanation

PICARD
Or the shielding around the
plutonium core will begin to
deteriorate Within a day the
entire silo will become so
radioactive that no one will be
able to come near it for a hundred
years

Ruby eyes him evenly

RUBY
Lie Thats two One more and
I pull the trigger

Picard is starting to get angry

PICARD
Why are you being so difficult
All Im asking for is to look at
one of the photographs Itll
take five minutes

RUBY

And all Im asking for is the
truth That would take five
minutes

(beat)
For all I know you caused the
explosions at the silo and now
youre trying to steal Zephrams
ship

PICARD
I am not a thief

Rubys had enough -- her temper flares and she gets off
the couch takes a threatening step toward Picard

RUBY
No youre a petty burglar anda
liar
(beat)

Youre no friend of Zephrams He
is a great man Hes not like you
or me or any of the other zombies
walking around this town

Picard jumps in with a quiet forceful quality

PICARD

No Hes a man with vision He
can see beyond the problems that
surround us He knows theres a
better future out there for
everyone a future where crime
poverty and war are things of the
past a future where we reach
out and seek our destiny in the
stars

(beat)
I believe in that future too
Ruby I believe in it in every

TO

fiber of my being And Im
telling you if we dont launch
that warp ship tomorrow theres
a very good chance that future
will never happen

She eyes him for a moment -- and were not sure if his
words have had any effect

Ruby still has her doubts but decides to go with her
gutand finally hands him the photographs Picard
glances through them -- his expression tells us the
photo he needs is in there

PICARD
You wont regret this

They share a look and then Picard turns and walks

off into the night Ruby watches him go and we can
see on her face a confused jumble of mixed emotions

Something about that man has touched her

NIGHT SCPOE POV

A telescopic green and white image of Picard walking
away from Rubys home

LIEUTENANT SCRIMM

is watching Picard through a set of night vision
binoculars perched on the roof of a nearby building
He frowns wondering what Picard is up to

EXT SPACE - ENTERPRISE DEFLECTOR DISH

The giant DEFLECTOR ARRAY at the front of the ship --
a giant round bowl-shaped array used for
communications and shielding As we watch FOUR
HATCHES OPEN surrounding the dish and BORG start to
emerge from the interior of the ship and CRAWL OUT on

Where Riker Troi Worf and NDs are watching this
image on the Viewscreen

Cur
RIKER
What are they doing

WORF
They appear to be modifying the
deflector dish

TROI
To do what If they wanted a
weapon they couldve taken over
a phaser bank or torpedo bay

RIKER
Deflector dish why the
deflector dish

WORF
It doesnt make sense The
deflector is only used for
shielding and long range

sensors
Riker stares at the screen notices something
RIKER
Computer -- magnify grid twenty-

one alpha

The image on the Viewscreen ZOOMS IN to a specific
point on the deflector dish giving us a clear view of
two Borg who have opened a gigantic panel on the dish
They appear top be modifying power conduits in some
fashion

WORF
Theyre re-routing the deflector
power conduits

RIKER
Computer -- thermal enhancement

The image now is overlaid with an INFRARED VIEW of what
theyre doing The power conduits are glowing bright
red very hot -- we can see the heat signature travel
back behind the dish and connect to a corkscrew-shaped
coil which is pulsing

RIKER
Theyre connecting the conduits to
subspace communications

WORF
(realizing)
Theyre converting the deflector
dish into an antennae
TROI
They may be trying to send a
message to the other Borgthe
Borg in this time period

WORF
What kind of message

RIKER
(thinking)
If it was me Id say attack
Earth now in the 21st
century theyll be too strong

in the 24th

They think about this for a moment as they watch the
Borg swarming on the deflector array

WORF
We have to stop them from sending
that message

RIKER
Agreed Options

WORF
Destroy the deflector dish

TROI

Can we aim our dorsal phasers at
it

Riker shakes his head

RIKER
Weve lost control of all weapons
systems Transporters are
down we cant get toa
Shuttlecraft and it would take
us too long to fight our way down
to deflector control

They think

WORF
There is another way Commander
Do you remember your zero-G combat
training

Riker looks a little wary at the suggestion

RIKER
I remember it made me sick

TROI
(to Worf)
What are you suggesting
RIKER
I think Mister Worf is suggesting
that we go outside for a little
stroll

The cloth photo is hanging from a beam on the catwalk
Geordi and Picard are watching a couple of NDs attach
the newly-built throttle assembly to the side of the
ship The NDs are using high-tech welding tools and
sparks are flying As they talk they head back up the
catwalk toward the control room

PICARD
Wheres you get the alloy for the
throttle itself

GEORDI

They used copper pipes in their
plumbing so I melted it down
and fused it with some tritanium
from one of our phaser casings

(beat)
Its not the strongest alloy
but its better than all this
crude aluminum and steel

141 INT MISSILE CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

As Geordi and Picard ENTER Lange is checking out a

The room is now humming with power -- its beginning to
look like the place is up and running Picard stops
near the desk

PICARD
Mister Lange -- have you brought
the computer systems back on-line
yet

LANGE
Aye Captain This trinary
language is pretty archaic but

I think I understand it now

PICARD

Picard and Geordis conversation Far in the distance
we can see the missile silo

PICARDS VOICE
Are we on schedule The Vulcan
ship will be here in less than two
hours

GEORDIS VOICE
Itll be tight but we should make
it

PICARDS VOICE
What about our warp signature It
has to be strong enough for them
to detect

GEORDIS VOICE
Ive enhanced the plasma injectors --
dont worry theyll see it

PICARDS VOICE
Well with any luck the Vulcans
will land outside Resurrection
tomorrow morning and Earth will
never be the same again

Scrimm and his men listen with growing alarm -- it
sounds like Picard is planning an invasion

can be seen standing nearby with a now conscious
Zephram Cochrane

LANGE
Doctor Crushers at the access
hatch Captain

PICARD
Let her in

Lange hits a couple of buttons

CLOSE ON COCHRANES FACE

A short time later His head is bandaged and hes
conscious but frankly he looks like hell He sits
back looking a little overwhelmed

COCHRANE
Let me get this straight youre
from the future Im about to
change history and all I have
to do is sit here and let you fly
my ship

WIDER

Picard Geordi and Beverly are standing around
Cochrane who is sitting in a high-backed chair ina
corner of the Control Room

PICARD
Thats right

He studies their faces -- sees theyre serious He
smiles a little ruefully

COCHRANE
And people say Im crazy

Picard smiles

Cur
PICARD
I assure you Doctor that after
today no one will ever call you
that again

Cochrane considers themfinally nods what the hell

COCHRANE
Just do me a favor bring my
ship back in one piece

PICARD
Thats a promise

Picard turns and walks off with Beverly Geordi moves
to Cochrane with a little bit of awe

GEORDI
Doctor my name is Geordi La
Forge Im an engineer Can I
shake your hand

Cochrane is touched by Geordis obvious respect They
shake hands

COCHRANE
I wish I could go with you Is
there anything I can do to help

GEORDI
Not really but I do have about
a thousand questions Ive always
wanted to ask you

COCHRANE
Since time is short why dont
you pick the top ten and fire

away
Geordi smiles

146 PICARD AND BEVERLY

have moved to another part of the room Beverly looks
exhausted She sets her medkit on a table and plops
down into a chair Mid-conversation

PICARD
(surprised)
You actually performed surgery

BEVERLY

It was an experience Metal
scalpels needle and thread
She looks up with a smile pulls a small DEVICE out of
the medkit -- a surgical transporter

BEVERLY
(re device)
But I had a little help Surgical
transporter I used it to beam
out most of the bone fragments
from his brain

PICARD
How did Doctor Almack react to
that

BEVERLY

He was so confused by what I was
doing I dont think he even
noticed

(beat)
Any word from the Enterprise

PICARD
Not yet

BEVERLY
You think theyre still up there

PICARD
(wry)
If theyre not wed better get
used to living in Montana

BEVERLY
(light)
That might not be so bad at
least for you

Shes kidding but Picard is a little defensive

PICARD
Whats that supposed to mean

There is no animosity or hint of jealousy in Beverlys
attitude shes simply making an observation about
someone she cares about

BEVERLY
I saw the way you looker at her
and I know that look

Picard doesnt want to argue about this -- to him its
a pointless conversation

PICARD
Regardless of how I may feel about
Ruby our fates lie along

different paths Nothing can

change that

BEVERLY
You want some advice Dont do
this again
(off his look)
You know exactly what I mean

PICARD
Beverly there were many reasons
why you andl

BEVERLY

Id call them excuses And the
first excuse on both our lists was
our sense of duty We convinced
ourselves that it was more
important than anything else And
you know what Its not

She holds his look for a moment

PICARD
(neutral)
I have a ship to launch

Picard turns and leaves Beverly watches him go
wondering whether her words had any affect

EXT RUBYS HOUSE - DAY

Ruby is turning off the spigot on the filter-pump The
plastic jug is now filled with the clear fluid --
silver halide She caps the jug picks it up begins
walking up on the porchthen hesitates for a

moment looks out over the horizon

She hesitates then frowns and goes inside

Ruby comes inside sets down the jug begins to pick
up some more glass plates stops thinks looks

up Only a few feet away is the large picture of
Picard She doesnt want to look at him doesnt want
to think about him but there he is

She glances back at the open door struggles for a
moment then makes a decision

Despite herself she cant get Picard out of her head
With a little frustration she grabs her camera bag and

heads for the door

INT BORG HIVE

ANGLE ON CEILING as the Borg Queen descends from her
nesting place down towards the camera ultimately
stopping just a few feet away She speaks directly to
the camera

BORG QUEEN
How do you feel

CLOSE ON DATAS HAND

His right hand is made of FLESH -- it has color
fingernails hair sweat Its completely human in
every way His fingers move slightly and then the
hand begins to rise We follow his hand as it comes up
and touches his FACE which is also FLESH The gold
color is gone his hair is tousled and natural-looking

Even his eyes are real now -- blue He touches his
face tentatively his expression confused but
intrigued
DATA
Different

The Borg Queen descends closer Datas arms are now
free but he is still restrained on the table The
rest of his body is still android mechanical

Data touches his two hands together feeling the
sensations flesh against machine He touches his face
and lips discovering himself in a totally new way

DATA
My internal sensors tell me the
ambient temperature in the room is
ten point two degrees Celsius
(wondrous)
But my skin tells me it is cold

As he talks we can see that hes becoming seduced by
his own newfound senses

DATA
My visual acuity has been reduced
by seventy-eight percent and I

can no longer perceive light
beyond the ultraviolet or the
infrared

(beat)
But I can see

Its an amazing moment Data riding a wave of feeling
and emotion like hes never had before The Borg Queen
watches pleased She hovers close to him

BORG QUEEN

Until today your emotions were
trapped inside an artificial
shell You didnt know what it
was to truly feel

(beat)
And theres so much more for you
to experience I will guide you
into a world of sensation unlike
anything you can imagine

(beat)
All you have to do is give us
access to your neural net

Data looks at her suddenly shocked back into reality

DATA
No I will not betray my friends

BORG QUEEN
Theyre not your friends
theyve held you back kept you

from your destiny

DATA
That is not true They have tried
to help me

BORG QUEEN

Have they given you what I have
given you Did they even try

DATA
I do not want this

But his words have a certain hollow quality to them
He is no longer as convinced as he was before and the
Borg Queen notes this immediately She reaches out
with a hand and gently strokes Datas cheek

BORG QUEEN
Youre becoming more human all the
time Data Now youre learning
how to lie

DATA
I wish to go back to the way I
was

BORG QUEEN

More lies

She SLAPS him hard across the face Data feels the
pain the shock A small trickle of blood comes from
his mouth He looks at her in surprise but before he
TO

can say anything she moves forward and KISSES him on
the mouth deeply and intensely Its a disturbing and
erotic moment She pulls back Data reels trying to
sort out the rapid succession of pleasure and pain
Her voice drops to a whisper and she moves even closer
to him face-to-face seductive beguiling

BORG QUEEN
Have you ever know a woman Do
you know what its like to feel
her breath on your face her
skin against yours flesh
against flesh

DATA
My creator did not intend for me
to experience these things

BORG QUEEN
Im your creator now

She rubs her body against his cat-like then pulls
him to her and kisses him deeply Off the image of
their bizarre embrace

Activate magnetic constrictors

They all activate controls on their wrists and there is
a faint hum of power as the suits are magnetized

Riker hits another control and the OUTER AIRLOCK DOOR
SLIDES OPEN revealing the vast vacuum of SPACE They
begin to walk out of the airlock

EXT SPACE - ENTERPRISE - AIRLOCK

As Riker and his team come out of the airlock on the
top of the saucer section Its a spectacular sight as
the small group of figures with weapons at the ready
marches toward the leading edge of the saucer The
scene is lit by light reflected by the Earth which
hangs above the ship

ON RIKER and WORF

As they approach the edge Worf gives a hand signal
and the rest of the team spreads out into a tactical
deployment and drops down onto their bellies They
crawl up to the very edge of the saucer and pause
Worf looks at Riker who looks a little queasy

WORF
(to Riker)
Are you alright

RIKER
Just a little queasy

WORF
Try not to look at the stars
keep your eyes on the ship

RIKER
Right

WORF
And Commander whatever you do
do not vomit in your exo-suit It
would be unpleasant

RIKER
Ill keep that in mind

Riker takes a few deep breaths to steady himself

RIKER
(to all)
Over and under

They all quickly scramble over the edge and onto the
underside of the saucer

The CAMERA ROTATES AND SPINS with them as they
traverse to the underside of the hull -- theyre
upside down relative to their previous position but
theres no up or down in space and their magnetized
suits hold them to the hull

Its a dizzying moment as we try to orient ourselves to
their new position From this angle the Enterprise
appears to be upside down

Once theyre on the underside of the saucer they can
see the rest of the ship laid out above them

NEW ANGLE - THEIR POV

The deflector dish (which is now above us) is covered
with dozens of Borg drones who are working to modify
it Some of them turn and see us

RIKER AND WORF
Begin running toward the torpedo tube on the saucer

(Running is difficult they must keep one foot on the
hull at all times) Several Borg PHASER SHOTS whip past

TO

them as the Borg open fire

THE BORG

A DOZEN of them leave the work on the dish and begin
skittering down (which is normally up) the
interconnecting dorsal on all fours toward our heroes
like a swarm of ants -- a frightening sight

A SECURITY GUARD

Is HIT by a phaser shot and goes FLYING OFF into space

THE TORPEDO TUBE

Riker reaches the opening to the torpedo tube bends
down and opens the hatch Borg phaser shots hitting
all around him The open hatch cover provides some
protection from the Borg fire

RIKER
Worf Im going to need at least

exchanging fire with the approaching mass of Borg

They pick off a few Borg who also go FLYING into

CLOSE ON DATA head tilted back eyes closed
smilinga few droplets of WATER fall from above onto

his face He smiles wider reveling in the sensation

WIDER

Data is still restrained on the table but a conduit
has been placed above his head and is dripping
condensation onto his face Data is now a completely
new being His entire BODY is now made of HUMAN FLESH
Its a shocking sight -- for anyone who ever wondered
what Data would look like human were now getting our
first look

THE BORG QUEEN

DESCENDS from her nest in the ceiling She watches
Data for a moment rubs the moisture into his face

BORG QUEEN
A Borg in all but name

Data although clearly enraptured with his new
sensations and feelings still struggles to maintain
his own sense of identity

DATA
(weak)
I am grateful for what you have
given me But I still do not wish
to be assimilated

BORG QUEEN
A universe of sensation is waiting
for you dont you want to
explore it with me

To his surprise Data finds that he is becoming drawn
to this strange creature and all that she can offer
him

DATA
Yes

BORG QUEEN
Then take the final step give
me the Enterprise and we can be
together always

He struggles but ultimately theres only one answer

DATA
No I cannot

Without taking her eyes away from Data she reaches out
a hand and touches a control on a nearby console The
color of Datas FACE turns an ASHEN GRAY -- as though
the blood has drained from his skin Another droplet
of moisture falls and hits him on the cheek -- but this
time his eyes widen in shock

The sensation of human feeling is gone

BORG QUEEN
Ive deactivated the sensory
inputs That flesh on your body
is just meat now

DATA
No no please you cannot

She moves in close on him an edge creeping into her
voice

BORG QUEEN
You must give me what I want
now Without the deflector dish
we can no longer send for an early
invasion We must assimilate
Earth ourselves I need this
ship

She hits the control and the COLOR returns to his
face Data gasps -- filled with feeling once again
The Borg Queen runs her hand across his cheek -- her
attitude seductive and affectionate once again

BORG QUEEN
Isnt it better like this

DATA
Yes but the Enterprise my
duty

BORG QUEEN

is to yourself Dont make me
hurt you again

She touches the control again Data is shocked back
into his cold android self Hes like a heroin addict
being denied his high with the flick of a switch

DATA
No no its so empty
please give it back I need
it

BORG QUEEN

And I need to control this ship
Let me into your mind

Data struggles anguished weve never seen him like
this before completely beaten down finally he
nods The Borg Queen touches the control again A
TO

sharp intake of breath as the feeling returns to Data
And the Queen kisses him on the mouth

This time he responds eagerly throwing himself into
the emotion of the moment She pulls back a little
looks at him softly passionately Data stares back at

her breathless -- he seems to be completely in her
thrall
DATA
In order to access my neural
net you will need to create a

Geordi works his console

EXT SPACE - THE PHOENIX

Two fifty-foot long sheets of metal fall away from the
ship on either side of the Phoenix revealing primitive
WARP NACELLES tucked inside the craft The warp
nacelles then begin slowly extending themselves outward
on either side -- the basic designs of the nacelles
should be familiar to anyone whos ever seen a STAR
TREK starship

This is the beginning of a long-standing architectural
design element of our ships

He turns away and then doubles over behind a console
and begins vomiting off screen Worf shrugs

surrounded by Borg consoles and technology Data is
still on the table with some kind of specialized
conduit connecting his head to a group of monitors
which are inactive at the moment He appears to be
caught up in the rapture of his new sensations and his
personal connection to the Borg Queen All thought of
his Starfleet responsibilities are gone

DATA
(to Queen)
I am re-routing Bridge command
functions to this location

Data thinks for a moment and the monitors suddenly
COME TO LIFE and the equipment around the Queen HUMS
with POWER

Information about critical Enterprise systems flows
across the monitor screens -- we might recognize
graphics from the Bridge displays The Borg are now in
control

BORG QUEEN
Eliminate their remaining
defenses I will send Borg to
assimilate the rest of the crew

Data nods but then one of the consoles BEEPS

There is a perimeter alert A
ship has entered sensor range

closer

I have repaired the weapons array
Phasers are on-line

A floating CROSSHAIR appears on the monitor showing the
warp ship The Queen works the console The crosshair
moves but refuses to lock onto the warp ship She
frowns

BORG QUEEN
The targeting lock isnt working

Data looks puzzled

DATA
I do not understand The optical
data network has been repaired
and all systems are functioning

The Queen works furiously still cant get the
crosshairs to lock onto the ship

BORG QUEEN
Your diagnostics are in error I
need weapons

DATA
(thinks)
The problem must lie in the
interface between Starfleet and
Borg technology Your console may
not be configured to handle the
data flow

BORG QUEEN
Can you configure it

DATA
I believe so

BORG QUEEN
Do it

She hits a series of Borg controls on a nearby
console and the restraints holding Data to the table
are RELEASED Two Borg drones move to him as he
stands up and heads for the Queen the specialized
cable still attached to his head

Data is standing right next to the Queen and is
studying the Borg console intently Two Borg drones
stand nearby watching closely

DATA
I believe I see the problem

In the blink of an eye

-- DATA WHIRLS AROUND AND SLAMS AN ARM INTO ONE OF THE
BORG DRONES The drone is knocked off its feet

-- The second Borg rushes at Data swings his arm at
Datas head This is the same Borg with the deadly
stiletto-tipped DRILL SPIKES seen earlier The spikes
TEAR into the flesh of Datas neck drawing BLOOD

-- Data reacts in pain He GRABS the Borgs arm and
with android strength KICKS HIM IN THE CHEST at the
same time The Borg FLIES BACKWARD causing the

cybernetic ARM to RIP from its socket in a shower of

sparks

-- The Borg Queen SWOOPS down at Data for the kill
But Datas too quick for her With one swift motion
he turns and THROWS the BORG ARM like a JAVELIN across
the room

NEW ANGLE

As the spikes on the severed Borg arm PUNCTURE one of
the diathermic oxygen tanks seen earlier A HUGE
EXPLOSION of DEADLY GAS bursts out of the ruptured
tank The WALL of roiling gas sweeps through the
entire Borg Hive

the right human arm is completely gone His torso is
stripped of the human flesh leaving pure android with
no soft human touches Data as weve never seen him
before -- raw and mechanistic

Data rolls over still locked around him is the
MECHANICAL SKELETON of the Borg Queen A metallic
spinal column with two arms with clawed hands leading
off it and a blinking electronic BRAIN STEM at the
very top of the spine

carcass writhes and claws at the air She speaks ina

to want to meet the man who flew

behind them react with shock and fear a few people
take a step back Picard looks at Cochrane who
hesitates for a moment then finally takes a deep
breath and strides out toward the alien ship A man
alone about to change the course of human history

Ruby moves closer to Picard and puts her arm around
him and he puts his arm around her

EMERGE They stand across from Cochrane -- a moment
frozen in time

watching

THE LEAD VULCAN

pulls his hood back revealing the familiar slanted
eyebrows and pointed ears holding himself with that
austere regal dignity weve come to associate with his
race He steps forward to greet Cochrane raises his
hand as if to wave

Cochrane raises his hand automatically as if to wave
in return

But then the Vulcan splits his fingers in the classic
Vulcan greeting

VULCAN
Live Long and Prosper

Cochrane tries to emulate the Vulcan hand-signbut
cant quite do the awkward finger-split
