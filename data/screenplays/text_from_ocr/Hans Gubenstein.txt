GUBENSTEIN Tell us what youre
working on Hanz

HANZ GUBENSTEIN stares out at the camera he’s a dead
ringer for A YOUNG ALBERT EINSTEIN with the bushy
mustache and crazy hair He’s surrounded by beakers
test-tubes and electrodes

HANZ GUBENSTEIN

(thick German accent)
Behind me you will see the
Kacktgucknetch

(an unintelligible German

gibberish word)
which by accelerating radio and
photonic waves to a speed
exponentially faster than the speed of
light will enable us to bend the
fabric of space and time and send a
message back into the past A time
machine if you will - giving us the
opportunity to avert major disasters
save lives and otherwise correct
mistakes

Hanz looks blankly at the camera done talking

DR JEFFRIES (VO)
Thats it Thats the only historical
record of Hanz Gubenstein - after that
pronouncement - his first public
announcement of his work on the Kaptph-
Kackft Ka - Ka -

(can’t pronounce the word)
kakakaka - Whatever it was he
called it - his “time machine” As
near as I can tell shortly after this
news film was shot Hanz faded very
plainly into obscurity no record
even of his death But what if his
invention of the Kaktgugen -
Kagkagugu whatever - What if it did
work

HANZ working in a lab with ALBERT EINSTEIN - THEY REALLY
DO LOOK A LOT ALIKE

DR JEFFRIES (VO cont’d)
If Hanz Gubenstein had succeeded in
December of 1935 - History would have
taken quite a different turn wouldnt
it have wouldnt have Woulden
Would not it have Would not it ha -
THINGS WOULD HAVE BEEN A LOT
DIFFERENT A time machine in the
hands of the Third Reich - The summer
of 1936 - Hitler suffers public
humiliation because “BLACK” American
Runner Jesse Owens beats his “Superior
Race” of athletes in every event
Hanz sends a message back in time -
the German officials find a clever way
to prevent Owens from entering the
country The Germans sweep the track
and field events

DR JEFFRIES (VO cont’d)
The entire tide of the war and history
Itself would have been turned

DR JEFFRIES (VO cont’d)
»»and sometimes I think it was
Maybe Hanz Gubenstein invented his
k-kah-ka- thing-a-ma-who and
succeeded in winning the World War for
Germany I think somewhere there is
a Time Magazine cover proclaiming Hanz
Gubenstein as the greatest scientific
mind of the Twentieth Century

Time Magazine “HANZ GUBENSTEIN MAN OF THE CENTURY”

DR JEFFRIES (VO cont’d)
But if Hanz succeeded and changed
history you have to ask why dont I
remember it
Stock footage of Nazi horrors

DR JEFFRIES (contd)
He could have had a crisis of
conscience - finally came to his
senses - And sent back a message to
try and change everything back - sent
back a message right to the beginning
when he had first invented it - the
whatever the hell he called it -
Warned himself of the horror that was
Adolph Hitler And either it worked
and he kept quiet or he mistakenly
wiped his own invention out of
existence either way history would
have reverted back to its natural
course

THE FOURTH PERSON TO INVENT TIME TRAVEL”

Jeffries MUMBLES QUIETLY to himself His fingers probe
the computer screen - hesitant to touch it

He reaches over and picks up a REMOTE - TURNS ON A SMALL
13” TELEVISION The SCREEN is completely blocked by soda
cans Jeffries jumps up and pushes the cans out of the
way

He flips through the channels until he finds a
commercial Its THAT ANNOYING TONY LITTLE INFOMERCIAL
The hyper blond muscle guy yells everything he says

TONY LITTLE (ON TV)

Sunlight pouring in through the bedroom window - Sid
Hackenpfuss - still asleep in bed - still snoring

SCREEN TITLE “JANUARY 2 2004 845 am”

ONE BIG SNORTING SNORE - and Sid wakes up He roles
lazily out of bed He stands dressed in fruity boxers -
scratches a little too deeply into his boxers and
stumbles towards the bathroom

SCREEN TITLE “SID HACKENPFUSS
Co-inventor of Time Travel
(the fourth time it was invented) ”

Sid - is a man in his late thirties - trying desperately
to hold onto his twenties

He walks in a hallway and trips over his dog WAGGLES -
one of those ugly dogs with too much skin The dog
yelps

Sid enters the bathroom leaves the door open We hear
him peeing
A BLINKING MESSAGE on the ANSWERING MACHINE

Sid finishes and exits the bathroom He kicks a dog toy
which he picks up and throws across the room It knocks
over the answering machine

Waggles chases after the toy Sid picks up the machine
sees the blinking light He sets the machine down and
presses play

He walks towards the kitchen as the message plays

Sid can’t hear the message well in the kitchen He pours
canned dog food into a dish marked “Waggles ”

INT JEFFRIES’S LAB - DAY

The lab has been cleaned up - Jeffries sits quietly near
the computer He wears his trademark white lab coat

SCREEN TITLE “JANUARY 3 2004 8 am”

A noise outside the door - Sid enters He heads directly
to a coffeepot Jeffries’s eyes follow Sid everywhere -
the door - the counter - the coffee maker

Sid finally looks up - sees the Doctor looking at him
Looks at his watch then at a clock on the wall Goes
back his routine

DR JEFFRIES
Sid how long have we been working
together on my uh

SID
Time Machine

DR JEFFRIES
Don’t call it that

SID
I don’t know - a long time five
years

DR JEFFRIES
And we’ve had some very interesting
times in five years - haven’t we

SID
It’s a good job Sure

DR JEFFRIES
Sid - you’ve done some magnificent
work here - really - the work on the
Particle Wave Accelerator has been
crucial to our present momentum As
you know - I’ve been pursuing Hanz
Sid walks

Gubenstein’s dream for more than
twenty years and the leaps forward in
the past five have been in large part
thanks to your engineering expertise
Your work truly rivals no other

SID
Thanks Doc

DR JEFFRIES
My point is Sid I want to be clear
that we are sharing credit for this
invention The success of it

SID
That’s great Doc But shouldn’t we
wait until it works before we make any
pronouncements

DR JEFFRIES

Sid I know you’ve been a little
pessimistic about our chances for
success Frankly the setbacks we’ve
endured since last November - left me
feeling less than sure our efforts
were being directed in the right

(searches for the right word)
direction

SID
Doc before did you mean to say that
my work is rivaled by no other
Because when you say my work “rivals
no other” it really means the
opposite

DR JEFFRIES
Sid weve done it Weve succeeded
Sitting in front of you is the first
working device capable of generating
an energy wave - which travels
independent from our own temporal
plane A working time machine

SID
Really

to the machine and investigates

DR JEFFRIES
Well - I’m sorry that in the
excitement I just called it that - but
yes Sid with the invention of
this invention we have securely
marked our places as the greatest and
second greatest minds of the century
Mark this date in the history books
January 3 2004 Well - really mark
yesterday’s date - because that’s when
I had the break-through Let me
explain - you’re a bit behind because
of the holiday

SID
Thanks Doc - I appreciated the time
off

DR JEFFRIES

Yes - and I planned - myself - to
enjoy a quiet night at home watching
Dick Clarks Rockin New Years Eve -
free my mind from several of the road
blocks weve been experiencing in our
development of the Time

(what to call it)
thing Ive been telling you since
mid November that I felt we were close
to a break through and I’ve been
flummoxed that the device was not
working But as is often the case by
taking a step back from the issue - we
are metaphorically speaking able to
see the forest for the trees

SID
Wait a second - what you just said

DR JEFFRIES
Dont interrupt Sid - this is just the
preamble Where was I The paradox
of

SID
Yeah but Doc -

DR JEFFRIES
Which Part

SID
The greatest minds of the century

DR JEFFRIES
Yes

SID
Or more to the point what you said was
-- “YOU” are the greatest mind and “I”
am the second greatest

DR JEFFRIES
Oh dear well - yes Sid - I mean -
your contributions have been
invaluable - but the initial
inspiration and main driving -

SID
No Doc you dont understand I’11
give you the number one spot - I just
dont think Im number two mind of the
century

DR JEFFRIES
Well all humility aside Sid - youre
computations and work have been
instrumental in the development of
the Time Machine - I hate to call
it that but -

SID
What about Albert Einstein

DR JEFFRIES
Albert Einstein

SID
Come on - theory of relativity - the
development of nuclear power

DR JEFFRIES
Albert Einstein died in 1955 While
he was certainly the greatest mind of
the twentieth century - I said we were
the Greatest minds of this century -
as you well know - the year is 2004 -
the 2lrst century

SID
Yeah Oh I thought we were counting
back a hundred years from today all
the way back to 1904 I didnt know
we had to break right on the turn of
the century

DR JEFFRIES
Yes Well we do - thats how its
done Hes dead - its the twenty
first century he doesnt count If I
could continue I was settling in to
watch the Dick Clark New Years
Special when it occurred to me -

SID
What about Stephen Hawking

DR JEFFRIES
Excuse me

SID
Unification of General Relativity with
Quantum Theory The Large Scale
Structure of Space-time A Brief
History of Time Stephen Hawking I
just cant get my mind around some of
it Now Ill concede - Im a smart
guy - all humility aside - but how can
I be number two when theres this guy
Stephen Hawking whose essays leave me
baffled

DR JEFFRIES
Okay - but Stephen Hawking’s major
essays were written in the mid-to-late
half of the twentieth century Ill
give credit where credit is due - and
call Hawking the number two greatest
mind of the twentieth century - but
his achievements are in the past

SID
But hes still alive

DR JEFFRIES
Look it doesnt count - if the work
you did was in the last century you
cant just ride in on the coat tails
He was the number two mind in the
Twentieth Century I think that should
be enough for him Moving on - as you
know - in mid November

SID
What about Ian Wilmut of the Roslin
Institute He cloned those sheep when
was that

DR JEFFRIES
February 1997

SID
Seven years ago Wow

DR JEFFRIES
The transmitter has been -

SID
Okay but what about John D McPherson
Robert Waterston and The Human Genome
Project Public Consortium Who knows
yet how thats going to revolutionize
medical treatments

DR JEFFRIES
That was the year 2000 Do I need to
explain again when the current
Gregorian calendar was adopted there
was no allowance for the year zero
They started with the year 1 which
means the first century ran from 1 to
100 - second century from 101 to 200
and so on - besides which -

SID
It was February of 2001

DR JEFFRIES
Regardless As wonderful as the
accomplishments of sheep cloning and
the mapping of human genes are - I
hardly think they match the sheer
magnitude of warping the space time
continuum May I continue As you
know weve had a working transmitter
since 1999 Our problem has been the
development of the receiver

SID
Say what about that I mean we
started our work in the twentieth
century - so do we really deserve
full credit as the greatest minds in
the 2lrst century

DR JEFFRIES
The breakthrough - which I am trying
to tell you about - came in the 21rst
Century - so I certainly do think it

counts Look Sid - if you dont want
to take your rightful place in the
history books - thats your choice
Okay look - Im skipping the
exposition - lets cut to the chase
The other day I had a major
breakthrough

SID
Uh huh

DR JEFFRIES
Come over hear and sit down - right
here in the chair - in front of the -
well I don’t have a name yet for the
device I’11 show you a
demonstration

Sid moves to the computer

DR JEFFRIES
Youre about to get your socks blown
off

They sit quietly for a moment staring at the screen
Sid glances away from the screen and Jeffries directs
him back towards the screen Sid starts to talk - he
gets shushed

Finally (and suddenly) Jeffries SHOUTS

DR JEFFRIES
(shouting)
AND BOOM

SID JUMPS - Jeffries points dramatically at the screen

SID
Why did you yell Boom

DR JEFFRIES
Read the screen - what time is listed
on the chronometer - it says 080530 -
remember that - eight-o-five-thirty-
eight-o-five-thirty- eight-o-five-
thirty

He keeps repeating this under his breath

DR JEFFRIES (contd)
Remember that - turn on the television
- eight-o-five-thirty- eight-o-five-
thirty

SID
Listen - what is this all about

Jeffries turns on the TV Flips the channel a couple of
times - and finds a commercial

DR JEFFRIES
Channel 6 - what have we here Hair
Color - Clairol 23 Move over a
little Sid
SID
Sure

Jeffries leans over - types at the computer
The commercial changes to an arthritis commercial

DR JEFFRIES
Okay - Arthritis Pain - hmmmm This
is the test I ran last night What
time did we say it was a minute ago
I repeated it 12 times

Sid stares at him blankly

DR JEFFRIES (contd)
Eight-o-five-thirty Witness Sid
Witness the sheer awesome power of the
- whatever we decide to call this
machine - the power to warp the fabric
of reality is at our hunt and peck
finger tips

Sid yawns reaches for his coffee
DR JEFFRIES (contd)
I am sending a message from right now -
the reading on the chronometer is
about 807 to a point in time about
two minutes ago - 080530
On the screen he types this message Greetings from the
future Please turn on the television and switch to
channel 6 - You will
DR JEFFRIES (contd)
Im describing the last minute weve
just experienced - and I am sending it
are you ready -
Sid sips his coffee

SID
Punch it Chewie

Jeffries presses down on the keyboard

DR JEFFRIES
-Now

TIME STOPS Everything freezes for a fraction of a second
- and reverses

The entire LAST MINUTE PLAYS BACKWARD AT SUPER SPEED

In a matter of seconds - then the rewind stops - and
starts again forward

INT JEFFRIES’S LAB - DAY
Jeffries and Sid sit staring at the computer

SCREEN TITLE “JANUARY 3 2004 805 am

(the second time)”
Jeffries and Sid sit in silence

DR JEFFRIES
(shouting)
- and Boom

SID JUMPS Jeffries points dramatically at the screen

SID
Why did you yell Boom

The machine begins beeping We see a tight shot of the
screen - It reads MESSAGE RECEIVED

sID
Ah huh

DR JEFFRIES
Well read it

SID
Greetings from the future Please
turn on the television and switch to
channel 6 - You will see a commercial
for Clairol 23 Coloring formula This
will be immediately followed by a
commercial for Arthritis Pain

DR JEFFRIES
(suppressing a giggle)
Sid turn on the TV -

He hands Sid the remote and they turn on the TV
Flipping to channel 6 Its playing the same Clairol
commercial

Sid looks unimpressed

A printer hooked to the computer has spit out a piece of
paper

SID
Whats the gag Doc

Dr Jeffries hands the paper to Sid He looks at it -
its a print out of the message including the date and
time the message was sent and received

DR JEFFRIES
Dont you see Sid Its a message
from the future Weve received a
message from 808 and some odd seconds
- predicting for us which commercials
would be playing on channel six at
exactly 80530

SID
What can I say
(underwhelmed)
Neat

DR JEFFRIES

Neat

SID
Well it’s not the most impressive
demo

DR JEFFRIES
IT’S PRACTICAL It’s a practical
demonst-- Look we’ll try it again
with something more dramatic
tomorrow if you wait a day - I’1l
send back all of the headlines in
tomorrow’s paper

SID
Doc I didn’t mean to offend

DR JEFFRIES
Yeah

SID
Yeah

Jeffries walks and sits in the corner of the room
sulking Sid reads the print out

SID (contd)
Say Doc Assuming this is what you
say - can I ask a dumb question Who
sent the message

DR JEFFRIES
Well we did - I assume I did

SID
You assume you did You dont
remember sending it

DR JEFFRIES
Of course I dont remember sending it -
it was sent at some time after 808
this morning - it hasnt happened yet

SID
Yeah - well point of fact Doc

Looks at the computer’s clock

SID (contd)
the message here says it was sent
at 808436 seconds - and its
already well past 809 on the
computer Assuming youre correct
the message was sent 30 seconds ago
So who sent the message at 80843

Jeffries smiles Then giggles

DR JEFFRIES
Thats where it gets complicated And
I got clever That’s the whole key to
making the device work Sid allow me
to explain
(pauses to compose his

thoughts)
Suppose we were reading the paper on a
nice Thursday morning in the spring

We’ll see his story acted out as he explains things
EXT PARK BENCH —- DAY

A sunny day Jeffries sits at a bench reading a paper to
Sid

DR JEFFRIES
- sitting in the park - enjoying the
day

He looks at his watch

DR JEFFRIES

Its 845 am And - oh my god Sid
look at this - the front-page headline
mentions a mid air disaster - a plane
taking off last night collided with
another that was landing at the same
time 425 dead What can we do about
it

Sid shrugs
INT JEFFRIES’S LAB - DAY
Jeffries sits typing at the computer Sid behind him

DR JEFFRIES
If were good Samaritans - we rush
back to the computer lab and we send
a message back in time - warning about
the crash Assume it took us a few
minutes to get back here - and we send
the message at 9 am on the button
Thursday morning Were going to send
a message back one day

Dr Jeffries SPINS AROUND in his chair

DR JEFFRIES
So lets cut to the day before -
Wednesday morning - the crash wont
happen until this evening - Were
hanging out in the lab - when the
message is received

The TIME MACHINE ACTIVATES - the screen lights up and the
PRINTER SPITS OUT A MESSAGE

DR JEFFRIES
This is Wednesday morning Oh my god -
were shocked to read about the plane
crash And were off and running to
the airport

INT AIRPORT - NIGHT

Sid and Jeffries WALK THROUGH AN AIRPORT

DR JEFFRIES
Hoping to find a clever way to avert
the disaster and save those 425
people

They come to a counter

SID
So we get to the airport How do we
stop the crash

DR JEFFRIES
I dont know - One of the planes was
taking off We just need to delay it
by a few minutes

Jeffries glances around He sees a PILOT WALKING WITH A
STEWARDESS

Jeffries walks up to the PILOT and KICKS HIM HARD IN THE
SHIN The PILOT FALLS to the ground

Jeffries KICKS HIM SEVERAL TIMES while hes down

SID
(calmly - detached)
That seems a little over the top

DR JEFFRIES
Well of course we might try a verbal
approach first - but for the purposes
of my illustration - lets assume it
comes to this

Hes STILL KICKING THE PILOT
DR JEFFRIES
Hundreds of lives are at stake after
all

SID
Wouldnt this put us in jail

DR JEFFRIES
For the purposes of my illustration
thats the point
TWENTY COPS SHOW UP THEY GRAB THE DOCTOR AND SID

THE COPS BEAT THE TWO OF THEM and DRAG THEM AWAY The
pilot is helped up to his feet - beaten and bruised

INT JAIL CELL - DAY
Sid and Jeffries share a cot
DR JEFFRIES
So its early Thursday morning - and
weve saved some odd hundred people -
but were stuck in jail Heres our
problem - the clock is ticking

A clock on the wall creeps toward 9 oclock
DR JEFFRIES
Its Thursday at nine - were stuck in
jail - all of this has come to pass
because of a message that was sent
Thursday morning - at 9 am - This
Thursday morning If its Thursday
morning and were stuck in jail - we
wont be able to get to the lab and
resend the message

INT JEFFRIES’S LAB - DAY
The Time Machine sits idle

DR JEFFRIES
Consequently - at 9 am - The message
WON’T be sent
INT JEFFRIES’S LAB - DAY
Sid leans back in a chair blows paper wads out of his
mouth straight into the air - catches them with his
mouth
Jeffries ignores him
DR JEFFRIES
If the message isnt sent at 9 am
Thursday then we have nothing to
receive Wednesday morning - we never
hear about the plane crash later in
the evening

DR JEFFRIES
Heres the beauty of it Sid We’re

stuck in jail at 9 am Thursday
morning The computer back at the lab
automatically re-sends the message to
Wednesday morning at the exact time it
was originally sent

INT JEFFRIES’S LAB - DAY
The EMPTY lab The computer screen reads Auto Resend

SID (VO)
So were stuck in the jail - The
computer resends the message - we
dont

INT JAIL CELL - DAY

DR JEFFRIES
Right

SID

Wednesday we receive a message - not
sent by either one of us - this
message was automatically sent by a
computer Thursday - because

(pauses )
it received the same message on
Wednesday

INT JEFFRIES’S LAB - DAY
Sid and Jeffries sit at the computer

SID
Doc this message I have in my hand -
about the commercials It was sent
from the future automatically by the
computer Doc we wont ever remember
sending any messages - because the
computer does all the resending for
us
These messages will in essence come
from nowhere - predicting the future -
we can change the past - but once we
do - once its changed - we wont have
any memory of it

DR JEFFRIES
Exactly

SID
So how far back can we send messages
Could we save Kennedy

DR JEFFRIES
Theoretically Sid - the accelerated
waves travel infinitely back into time
- we could send a message back to the
60s or even to the colonial years of
America but no one will hear them
We just got the receiver on line
yesterday - well have to start from
this day forward

They glance at the screen

DR JEFFRIES (cont’d)
January 3 2004

SID
So doc - when do the messages start
coming in Where are the messages
from the future

DR JEFFRIES
Im sure theyll be coming any second
now

They look at the screen for a few seconds - look at their
watches nothing happens

DR JEFFRIES
Well I suppose this is the start of
things tomorrow we’ll read the news
paper and send back our first
message

SID
Let’s see if I follow you correctly
and Doc I killed a lot brain cells in
the eighties - so uh - ha-ha who
knows But if we send a message
back tomorrow to this morning right
now then reality changes We won’t
be having this conversation about no
messages because we will have
received one
So in all likelihood anything we do
between now and tomorrow will be
snapped out of existence

DR JEFFRIES
Right - because we will proceed
forward based on our reaction to
whatever message we receive

DR JEFFRIES
So the rest of the day is a free-
bee what do you do if you know you
won’t have any consequences
INT MALL - MERRY-GO-ROUND - DAY

DR JEFFRIES

Holy - bajeezus What is all of this
stock market crap What possible
interest would I have in this How
are we supposed to make productive
social impact with our invention if
there arent any disasters for us to
fix

Sid pulls back a his hood a little

SID
Doc I’ve been thinking about your
demonstration yesterday and you

know how I thought it was a bit
underwhelming

DR JEFFRIES
It was practical

SID
Sure Sure I’m just noticing in
this section that the Lottery wasnt
won by anyone last night

DR JEFFRIES
Sid I did not invent the time machi--
the time device for our own
worldly gain

SID
No No I just mean - you could
send it back as a demonstration
We could give the money to charity or
start a foundation

Sid turns back to reading the comics

DR JEFFRIES
I suppose I mean it certainly
wouldnt hurt our cause if we had a
little cash to help fund the cause

INT JEFFRIES’S LAB - DAY
Jeffries types at the computer

DR JEFFRIES
Now Sid - you realize - once we send
this message back to yesterday - well
potentially wipe out all of the fun we
had yesterday If we head off to the
store and purchase a lottery ticket -
we may not make it to the merry go
round and Pizza Palace

Jeffries pauses - with his finger over the enter key

messages

DR JEFFRIES
Look at this You’ve sent the same
message 1560 times We’re caught ina
loop

He hands several messages to Sid
DR JEFFRIES
You already sent this message once at
1215 am — I never read it I made it
to message 19 and it was 21 I never
even realized it was there — so you
went to send it again — at that same
time the computer automatically resent
the message And we were left with
two messages I never read And so on
and so on Two messages were
automatically resent when you were
sending a third

Jeffries punches at the keyboard

wasn’t sent already — and missed

“Black Sedan will chase you again”

Sid shuffles through the papers — curses to himself He
GUNS HIS ENGINE

(dripping with sarcasm)
That you determined an equation to
measure the laws of probability

Sid shrugs “Yeah”

AGENT AGHENT (contd)
4 States have passed laws against you
— or Dr Jeffrey Jeffries — or any of
your relatives playing or winning in
any of their Big Lotto Lottery games
25 Other states have bills pending in
their legislature

EXT SID’S CADILLAC - CONTINUOUS
Some more Flunky Agents rummage through Sid’s car
INT BLACK SEDAN - CONTINUOUS

SID
Is there a point to all this

AGENT AGHENT
I know the probability equation was a
cover How’d you really do it

SID
I could tell you today But you won’t
remember it

AGENT AGHENT
You’re so clever you’re stupid

AGHENT ROLLS DOWN his own WINDOW — reaches outside A
FLUNKIE HANDS him the MESSAGES from Sid’s car Aghent
pages through the papers

AGENT AGHENT (contd)
For three weeks I’ve been trying to
meet with you How have you been
avoiding me Who tipped you off to
where we would be looking

SID
Nobody

AGENT AGHENT
Bull Someone sent these e-mails

He holds up the messages Sid shrugs
EXT BOULEVARD - CONTINUOUS
The Sedan door opens and the two men step out

AGENT AGHENT
I don’t know what kind of scam you two
are pulling Mr Hackenpfuss It
doesn’t matter if all you care about
is getting rich
I suppose that’s just more tax money
to fund my salary Just know we’re
watching you

Sid looks at the Business card he was given earlier

AGENT AGHENT (contd)
If we feel you pose a threat to the
Nation We’ll remove that threat
You won’t see it coming

SID
Not the first time anyhow

AGENT AGHENT
Please don’t forget we talked

SID
No This time I don’t think I will

The agents climb into their Sedan and leave Sid walks
to his car

EXT PARKING LOT JEFFRIES’S LAB - DAY

A chain link fence slides open Sid’s Cadillac cruises
up to a reserved parking spot The gate closes

In the next parking spot a Red Ferrari
Tight in on THE LICENSE PLATE it reads “1 BRAIN”

Sid gets out of his car - looks around The entire
parking lot has been fenced in with chain link and barb
wire

Sid heads towards the inside - and is startled when a
YOUNG LADY JUMPS OUT from nowhere

SUZY THE GROUPIE
Oh my god Dr Hackenpfuss I mean
Mr Hackenpfuss I mean Sid - I’ve
been waiting out here since last
night

SID

Geez Hello
From Sid - a look of recognition and confusion

SUZY THE GROUPIE
Sid - you never called me after last
week

She continues rambling on - speaking entirely too fast
Above the building entrance - a SECURITY CAMERA pans and
focuses in on Sid and Suzy

INT SECURITY MONITOR BANK - CONTINUOUS

On a small black and white security monitor - Suzy The
Groupie gesticulates madly NO SOUND but she’s talking
on and on Sid walks to the door ignoring her

A second monitor displays inside the building Sid and
Suzy enter the building and walk down a hall SUZY just
WON’T SHUT UP

On a third monitor the pair walk to a large steel door
INT LAB ENTRANCE - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Sid stands at the steel door - punching numbers into an
electronic KEYPAD Suzy The Groupie keeps yapping

SUZY THE GROUPIE
then I was talking to Dawn and
telling her there’s no way I thought
you were purposely avoiding me

Sid places his PALM on a SCANNER

SUZY THE GROUPIE (cont’d)
-Dawn told me to come down to where
you work and wait - and the barb wire
outside made it kind of difficult

KACHUNG - A HEAVY BOLT LOCK from inside the door
screeches

SUZY THE GROUPIE (cont’d)
»-oh my god that’s a loud lock -
anyhow the barbwire ripped a little
of my skirt which you can see Kind
of sexy huh

She shows the RIP IN HER SKIRT
The door pops open with an electronic greeting

COMPUTER VOICE
Welcome to the lab Mr Hackenpfuss

INT JEFFRIES’S LAB - CONTINUOUS

The lab has been greatly expanded One entire wall
filled with televisions plays Financial News World
News etc A small rack of black and white security
monitors stands in the corner
Sid ENTERS with Suzy The Groupie in tow He walks
directly to the TIME MACHINE CONTROL COMPUTER

SUZY THE GROUPIE
»I was like - if he doesn’t call
then it must be because he lost my
number and Dawn was like

DR JEFFRIES (0S)
What in the hell do you think you’re
doing

Suzy The Groupie SHUTS UP - FINALLY

Sid turns to see Jeffries - huddled in a corner behind
the security monitors JEFFRIES HAS A GUN IN HIS HAND

Jeffries has a light beard growing from a week’s worth of

not shaving

DR JEFFRIES (cont’d)
No one else enters the lab - if I’ve
told you once - I’ve told you a
million times YOU AND I NO ONE
ELSE ENTERS THE LAB

Sid groans and goes back to typing at the computer

SUZY THE GROUPIE
Do you work for Sid - I mean Dr
Hackenpfuss

Jeffries jumps to the center of the room WAVING THE
MADLY at Suzy

DR JEFFRIES
No one else enters the lab Sid
Tell me now Who is this person

SID
Uhmmm Doc - this is Okay - I
tried to get away with it but I
can’t I have forgotten your name

SUZY THE GROUPIE
Suzy

GUN

She reaches out to shake Jeffries’s hand - sees the gun

and recoils
Sid finishes typing
SID
Right Suzy Doc say hello to
Suzy
Jeffries lowers his gun to shake her hand
DR JEFFRIES
Hello I’m sorry
(Shrugs about the gun)
You see no one else enters the lab

On the computer a message reads “avoid strange

girl

at party later tonight”

Sid types he deletes the words “strange girl” - replaces
them with “Avoid Suzy at the party later tonight”

Then adds “Maybe avoid party all together ”

SID
» and say goodbye to Suzy Sorry
Suzy it was mostly okay

He presses the enter key BAM

HE HAS ALTERED TIME We see an effect to show the
altering of reality - a sort of double exposureflicker -
“THE GUBENSTEIN EFFECT”

BEFORE THE EFFECT Sid stands near the TIME MACHINE -
Jeffries stands shaking Suzy’s hand

AFTER THE EFFECT SUZY HAS DISAPPEARED - Jeffries sits
staring at the television bank Sid stands near the
door in mid-conversation

SID
-I was caught in traffic

DR JEFFRIES
What kind of excuse is that Send
back a message telling yourself to
leave a little earlier this time
Everyday it’s an excuse

SID
Yeah - I’m lying about the traffic
Doc - I’m never in before 1030
because I don’t need to be

DR JEFFRIES
Suppose something had happened to you

SID
Right Look - I’m sure if something
happens - and you don’t hear from me -
you’ll send a message back to
yesterday and warn me

DR JEFFRIES
Weve made a lot of waves with these
lottery winnings - I’m certain -
certain parties have taken notice

Sid looks at the business card he was handed earlier

DR JEFFRIES (contd)
The first order of business is to
check the messages Suppose the
computer jammed up over night

SID
I knew the computer wasn’t going to
burn out over night - because we have
these messages from Today Thursday
and all of next week - Looks like
it’s still working

DR JEFFRIES
What about June 30th

Jeffries picks up the messages and rifles through them

SID
Doc I’m not going to worry about June
30th until June 30th Maybe June
29th

DR JEFFRIES
Weve never received a message past
June 30th I have a June 29th here -
it says “So far so good”

He throws the messages to the table They fall to the
ground

DR JEFFRIES (contd)
SO FAR SO GOOD I’11 bet you’re the
one who sent it

SID
When was the last time we sent a
message back to February - or early
March even There’s no point to it

DR JEFFRIES
SO FAR SO GOOD Would it be so
difficult to send back a little more
explanation Something calming
Something that tells us the machine is
alright

SID
This is not the first time our future
selves have turned out to be rude to
our present selves

DR JEFFRIES
June 30th A day of reckoning is
coming

SID
What other kind of messages do you
have there

DR JEFFRIES
A day of reckoning mark my
reckoning words

Jeffries sits back near the TV’s - begins taking notes
SID
Doc you look terrible - when was the
last time you left the lab
Sid kneels to the floor and picks up the printouts
DR JEFFRIES

I’m mapping our continued future
growth

SID
We already have the stock futures for
the next two months - you forwarded
them to Randy Newberg right

DR JEFFRIES
Don’t get me started on Randy Newberg -
he’s an embezzler

SID
Since when

DR JEFFRIES
Tomorrow It’s in the messages there

Sid shuffles through the messages Finds one that
confirms what Jeffries said

SID
So well Call Debussey and Goldfing

DR JEFFRIES
There’s another message there it says
don’t bother - they’re as crooked as
Newberg

Sid finds the message and reads it
SID
(confirming)
Huh

DR JEFFRIES
The world is full of crooks

Sid reads another message
SID
It says here Ashkroft and Luntz has
worked out As of June 23 anyhow
Jeffries has picked up a phone - and dialed
DR JEFFRIES
Newberg you rotten crook What do you
think oh - sorry Yes I’1l hold
He hangs up the phone
Sid shuffles through the messages
SID
So well send these new tips over to

Ashkroft and Luntz

DR JEFFRIES
Fine

SID
And you’re going to head out and enjoy
yourself a little

DR JEFFRIES
I’m not comfortable going out right
now Certain Parties Certain
Parties

He rifles some more messages on the table

DR JEFFRIES (cont’d)
Plus I have these messages from the
next three weeks to contend with - and
some tweaking to do on the past few
weeks

SID
Doc you told me we didn’t invent the
time machine - sorry to call it that -
for personal financial benefits

DR JEFFRIES
With the kind of wealth we’re
accumulating - do you know the amount
of charities we can benefit

SID
And the amount of money spent on
defenses

DR JEFFRIES
We just need to guard against any
interference People are out there
right now plotting against us We’ve
made waves I don’t know who they are
- but I’m certain there are certain
people out there

INT DECENTRALIZED INTELLIGENCE AGENCY - DAY

COMPUTER LAB Jeffries still plugging away doing his best
Howard Hughes impersonation

MONTAGE SEQUENCE WRAPS UP
FADE TO
INT JEFFRIES’S LAB - DAY

A LARGE TARP takes up most of the LAB FLOOR COVERING a
LUMPY SOMETHING on the ground Jeffries - a bit crazed -
sits in the corner talking to Sid

DR JEFFRIES
As you know for the past two months I
have been what is the word

SID
Obsessed Crazed

DR JEFFRIES
Concerned About the lack of
messages from any date past June 30th
My assumption has been that either
something happens to the “machine” -—
or to the two of us on that date

SID
A huh

DR JEFFRIES
As the date has grown closer - I have
been building up our defenses - the
improved security outside - as well as
the large security door at the lab
All in anticipation of an attack by
certain parties My hope with each of
these measures was that one of these
would do the trick in protecting us
from whatever is to come - and we
would see a message from July At
this point Sid - I’m locked inside a
fortress - and yet we still have no
messages from the day past tomorrow

SID
So what’s next

DR JEFFRIES

Things were looking pretty dire But
last week I realized the solution or
rather - today I realized a solution
and sent it to myself last week The
direction we’re going - our fait is
inevitable I figured out exactly
what is necessary to saving us - to
preventing whatever doom is to befall
us on June 30th

SID
Don’t hold me in suspense

DR JEFFRIES
I must choose a path completely out of
the ordinary - I must take us in a
direction that is the complete
opposite of the direction I have been
going

SID
What does that mean

DR JEFFRIES
Since it doesn’t matter how many more
defenses we throw up here at the lab
I’1l go the opposite way I need an
openness - freedom

SID
I’ve been telling you that for 6
weeks

Jeffries reaches down and PULLS THE TARP from the ground
He and Sid look at WHAT IS REVEALED

SID
Ah Huh

DR JEFFRIES
I’m calling it Jeffries Isle I
bought an island

SID
You bought an entire island

On the floor an INCREDIBLY DETAILED MODEL of a LUSH
VOLCANIC ISLAND - with a MAJESTIC PALACE in the center
Jeffries leans down and plays with the model - like a kid
with a toy

SID (contd)
Is it an island or an isle

DR JEFFRIES
I think they’re the same I’m calling
it Jeffries Isle Look - this is
where well put the time device

He points to a tower in the palace

SID
You know They called the show
Gilligan’s Island - but the song said

Gilligan’s Isle - Don’t you thing
they could have worked that out
(singing)

“Here on Gilligan’s Isle -11111l
(he holds onto the last “L”
sound then)

L-L-LAND

Jeffries ignores him

SID (contd)
That could have worked
(to Jeffries)
Shouldn’t it be Jeffries’s Island

DR JEFFRIES
Isle

SID
Right Isle But Jeffries Isle Or
Jeffries’s Isle Jeffreisssssez

DR JEFFRIES
(harshly)
No
(he continues excitedly
playing with the model)
Look this wall is retractable

SID
When will all this be happening

DR JEFFRIES
Tomorrow

SID
Tomorrow

DR JEFFRIES
It has to be tomorrow Sid Before
June 30th

SID
Doc - I don’t want to move to an
island Where is this island located
anyway

DR JEFFRIES
The South China Sea - near Sumatra

SID
Have you ever heard of Oedipus Doc -
how do you know the reason we’re not
getting any messages is BECAUSE of the
move to the island Oedipus tried to
avoid his fate and instead ran head
long into it

DR JEFFRIES
So are you coming with me or not

EXT JEFFRIES ISLAND - DAY

A sweeping shot of the model - no it’s the actual
island

SID (V0O)
(Voice Over carried over from
the previous scene)
Near Sumatra

DR JEFFRIES (VO)
Halfway between the Indian Ocean and
the South China Sea It will be
wonderful and safe

SID (V0O)
I don’t want to move to China I’ve
been doing some good here in town

own private island nation

EXT ISLAND PALACE BALCONY - DAY
Sid stands on a balcony dressed in an island shirt

SID

Well it’s an amazing view

Sid looks out across the island Down the mountain he
can see a harbor Hundreds of people walking down a road
towards a number of large ships

INT PALACE - CONTINUOUS

Jeffries - still looking a bit ragged with his beard -
has a change of clothes - Bermuda shorts Hawaiian Shirt

between Howard Hughes and Jimmy Buffet

Sid enters from the balcony - sees the Jeffries talking
to another man MAHI TOPI a distinguished looking ISLAND
CHIEF

SCREEN TITLE “June 29 2004”

SID
What’s with the throngs down on the

Sid goes to shake the Chief’s hand

SID
Oohla Limpi

DR JEFFRIES
The former Oohla Limpi is now Jeffries
Isle I’ve paid to have Mahi and his
people relocated to a small
archipelago South East of here

MAHI TOPI CURSES in a foreign language - and SPI
SID’S FEET

DR JEFFRIES (cont’d)
(to Sid)
They have some strange customs here

Jeffries spits on the floor at Mahi’s feet - mis
this as the local custom

DR JEFFRIES (cont’d)
(to Mahi)
Yes well thank you for stopping by
Mr Pres- Minister - uhm - Topi

He gestures to usher him out the door

DR JEFFRIES (contd)
Please come back for a visit but call
first

Mahi curses as he is ushered out the door Jeff
returns

But the location and natural features
of Jeffries Isle were key to our
security

INT PALACE - CONTINUOUS

Jeffries takes Sid on a tour of the Villa - lots
and bamboo Pictures of the Oohlies abound As
walk Jeffries points out security features

DR JEFFRIES
Sure it took a big chunk of our
accounts but we pulled it off ina
week We managed to evict all of
the natives And I’ve computer
automated every function in the
Palace The Time control computer and
transmitter have been carefully moved
and are fully operational

SID
And the change in location won’t
effect the reception to the machine

waste my time with all of that
worrying

YOU DIDN’T RECKON WITH THAT DID YOU

SID
Doc you think of everything

The cannons do their job - and hit the fighter planes -

Jeffries and Sid stand around congratulating themselves -
all the while they are IGNORING THE HIGH PITCHED WHISTLE
which is getting LOUDER and LOUDER - it’s an incoming
missile launched from some offshore ship
KABLAM - THE EXPLOSION ROCKS THE BUILDING

SID
If you knew enough to put up the
reinforced walls and the surface to
air turrets - you’d think you would
have been prepared for more than this

Jeffries starts typing at the computer

DR JEFFRIES
It was a rushed message - it didn’t
specify what the threat was I’11
correct everything right now

EXT JEFFRIES ISLAND - PALACE - DAY

Mortar shell after mortar shell explodes against the re-
enforced Palace walls

Timed with each explosion - the “GUBENSTEIN EFFECT”
alters the Palace and adds layer upon layer of armaments
and reinforced walls

Boom - Short range missile silos
Boom - Additional armored walls
Etc

BOOM BOOM BOOM

In short turn - it becomes a full-fledged armored
fortress

The FORTRESS FIRES a giant shell back out into the sea
On the HORIZON A SHIP EXPLODES

INT PALACE COMPUTER CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Jeffries sits at the time control computer Sid stands
in a door arch - BRACING FOR MORE EXPLOSIONS

SID
Doc I have to admit - I was a little
baffled at first - I mean why go to
all the trouble of moving to a lush
beautiful island - when all you were
going to do was live inside a heavy
duty cement and steel fortress
But I guess you knew all along what
you were doing

Jeffries holds up a massive folder of messages and
laughs

The muffled explosions outside stop Jeffries and Sid
look at each other and listen to be sure it is over

EXT JEFFRIES ISLAND - PALACE - CONTINUOUS

The smoke clears - the foliage around the VillaFortress
has been decimated - burnt and black

Floating in on parachutes the PILOTS from the exploded
fighters They land on the roof - cutting free their
parachutes as they land

They hit the roof running - pulling weapons from their
backs They’re dressed in black and masks cover their
faces

INT PALACE COMPUTER CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUOUS
Sid still stands propped in the door arch

DR JEFFRIES
I think it stopped

SID
Do me a favor Doc - in two minutes -
if it’s still safe - send back a
message - and let me know I can move
from the doorway here

Jeffries scoffs at this with a laugh but then looks at
the machine - no such message comes His laugh dies out

Kachung - Kabuunk - Thud Thumping of the soldiers on
the roof

CRASH - in the other room - WINDOWS BREAKING

Sid and Jeffries can hear them They don’t know what to
do

DR JEFFRIES
(weakly and afraid)
A day of reckoning

He puts his hand to the keyboard
Boom - SID IS SHOT His arms and legs still spread out
in the doorway arch he looks down at blood spreading
across his chest
SID FALLS TO THE GROUND
JEFFRIES - dumb struck - STARTS TO TYPE A MESSAGE
The SOLDIERS FLOOD INTO the room from all entrances
They GRAB Jeffries and pull him away from the computer -

he reaches for the enter key - but can’t reach it

One of the soldiers stoops down where Sid has fallen He
turns his body over SID GROANS

ANOTHER SOLDIER ENTERS the room - He removes his mask -

AGENT AGHENT
(to Jeffries)
Dr Jeffries I presume

DR JEFFRIES
What’s the meaning of this Who are
you people

Jeffries kneels down to take care of Sid
DR JEFFRIES (contd)

Do you people realize I incorporated
this island last week This is it’s

own country This invasion is an act

of War

AGENT AGHENT
Calm yourself Doctor My name is
Agent Aghent with the United States
DIA We’re well aware of your new
national status Dr Jeffries It’s
the reason we’re here

DR JEFFRIES
I told you Sid a day of reckoning

Sid groans

AGENT AGHENT
»-and I told you Mr Hackenpfuss

DR JEFFRIES
Sid Do you know this person

AGENT AGHENT
-whatever secrets you two are

involved in whatever tricks you two

have going I told you to keep it on

a quiet level
And with your new incorporation -

You’re not even paying my salary with

your taxes
Sid groans
SID
See Doc You’re Oedipus You made

your own destiny

AGENT AGHENT

Sorry fellas - we need to take control

of this situation

He pulls out a gun and - KABLAM - shoots Sid
DEAD

DR JEFFRIES
NO My God How could you do that
Sid - I’m sorry I don’t know where
we went wrong

Jeffries cries quietly for a second He jumps

SID IS

to his

feet screaming anger He lunges at the time control
computer

KABLAM KABLAM KABLAM
Five different soldiers shoot Jeffries
JEFFRIES LIES DEAD

FLUNKIE AGENT
Sir You should see this

One of the flunky soldiers is sitting at the time
control computer

AGENT AGHENT
What is it

Agent Aghent moves to the computer

The screen reads “You must stop after one lottery
Don’t follow the wrong path Doom has come to --”

FLUNKIE AGENT
What do you make of it

AGENT AGHENT
Is it a diary entry

FLUNKIE AGENT
It looks like a message

Agent Aghent looks down at the dead Jeffries and Sid

AGENT AGHENT
We found their connection

FLUNKIE AGENT
It doesn’t make any sense

AGENT AGHENT
Press send Maybe we’ll get a
response

The flunky agent’s hand moves in slow motion - to the
enter key He presses down on it

Kiikikicth - Our Special “Gubenstein Effect” takes place -
and REALITY IS ALTERED

All of the Soldiers disappear - the destruction - the
armaments - everything disappears

And is replaced by MAHI TOPI laying in the middle of his
palace floor performing Pilates (or some other foolish
act - perhaps jumping rope double dutch style with a few
members of his staff)

INT JEFFRIES’S LAB - DAY

Back at the original computer lab Jeffries - clean cut
again

SCREEN TITLE “SATURDAY JANUARY 3 2004
(again) ”
The computer lights up and spits out a message

DR JEFFRIES
THIS IS IT SID - ONE GREAT STEP
FORWARD TOWARDS PEACE

He grabs the message and reads the slip

DR JEFFRIES
I dont understand Its a lottery
number

SID
Lottery number

DR JEFFRIES
Its tonights winning Big Lotto
number

SID
Seriously

DR JEFFRIES
This doesnt seem to fit in with my
whole - lets save the world ideology
Maybe we determined we needed money to
cure some dreaded disease Sid I
have every confidence that theres a
reason for this --

He is interrupted because the second message comes in

DR JEFFRIES
This will explain things

He reads the screen - Sid grabs the print-out

It reads “You must stop after one lottery Don’t follow
the wrong path Doom has come to --”

Jeffries stares confused at the screen He speaks

DR JEFFRIES (cont’d)
What the hell

He grabs the printout from Sid and reads it It’s the
same thing he saw on the screen

DR JEFFRIES (cont’d)
Why would we play one lottery let
alone multiple lotteries
EXT PARK BENCH —- DAY

Jeffries sits on a park bench reading the “Doom” message
in one hand In his other hand is a lottery ticket

Sid reads the tabloid Predictions for the Future

SID
How do they get away with printing

this sort of thing

DR JEFFRIES
This makes no sense - I didn’t even
want to play one lottery - why are we
getting this warning

SID
Trust the future Doc

DR JEFFRIES
It’s not even complete Something
happens on June 29th After we win
multiple lotteries

SID
It does read “doom” Doesn’t sound
good

DR JEFFRIES
Cut off in mid-sentence Why would we
want to play multiple lotteries I
can’t imagine what we were thinking
DOOM What’s going to happen on June
29th

SID
Were not going to play more
lotteries So it’s not going to
happen We agreed to stop after this
one trial

Jeffries scowls pensively He crumbles up the lottery
ticket and throws it towards a trash can He sits
quietly a second He jumps up and runs to the trash
can and picks up the lottery ticket Crumbles up the
doom message and throws it away

DR JEFFRIES
Sorry I zoned for a second I meant
to crumble up the message
(He’s fumbling)

and threw away the lottery ticket

instead Just now In the trash can
Sid ignores him - still reading the tabloid
Jeffries glances at the trash can Walks over and pulls
out the message Smoothes out the paper Folds it up and
puts it in his pocket

DR JEFFRIES (contd)
Buck up Sid
SID

He makes a puff in the air with his warm breath

DR JEFFRIES
How can a newspaper stay in business
Boring trash Where are the murders
Where are the twenty car pile-ups
The Plane crashes I refuse to
believe that the year 2004 is the dawn
of some sort of Halcyon Era of non-
violence and pain Nineteen days of
this dreck

Frustrated - Jeffries swats at the paper Wait a second -
he sees an article he somehow missed earlier

The tape starts to rewind Pull out - Agent Aghent and a
host of CORPORATE LACKEYS and FLUNKIE AGENTS are crowded
around a conference table watching the television

Agent Aghent HOLDS OUT A VCR REMOTE Fast forward - then
the program plays forward

SCLURP - The tape pauses It starts to rewind Aghent
CURSES UNDER HIS BREATH PAUSES the television PLAYS

He finally gets the tape PAUSED tight in on JEFFRIES’S
FACE - SMILING BIG

Aghent sets down the VCR remote

AGENT AGHENT
Tell me this isn’t the face of evil

Some grumbling and harumphing from the crowd

AGENT AGHENT (contd)
Dr Jeffrey Jeffries appearing on
popular cultural programs - making
light of everything good this country
stands for

More grumbling and harumphing
AGENT AGHENT (contd)
This is the kind of reckless disregard
for our country’s geo-social and
political mores

CORPORATE LACKEY
They’re saving

AGENT AGHENT
» which left unchecked will

CORPORATE LACKEY
-lives

AGENT AGHENT
Excuse me

CORPORATE LACKEY
I uhm said “They are saving
lives” Right

The Corporate Lackey gulps and pulls at his neck tie He
leafs through some pages in front of him

AGENT AGHENT
They are aggrandizing themselves

CORPORATE LACKEY (contd)
The Fire in Baltimore The robbery at
the -

AGENT AGHENT
Sir - I say to you that I save lives
every day - You and I both do So
does everyone in this room Don’t you
all save lives Sir don’t you feel
you save lives every day you work

CORPORATE LACKEY
Okay Sure I do What does that have
to do with -

AGENT AGHENT
Yes you do save lives Don’t cheapen
it And do you know why you save
lives

CORPORATE LACKEY
(struggling for an answer)
Because to serve or protect our

country

AGENT AGHENT

You save live because our country’s
tax dollars pay you to do so

(pointing at the screen)
Who’s paying for this Do you think
they’re doing it for free What price
do you think these two will be
asking

He holds up a picture Sid and Jeffries rescuing a cat
from a tree

AGENT AGHENT (contd)
for their services rendered

The Corporate Lackeys look at each other

AGENT AGHENT (contd)
This is nothing but showmanship and
falsely altruistic reverse
vigilantism
I have no doubt that they are
providing an apparent service -
APPARENT But I ask you is it mere
coincidence and good fate that puts
these persons in the proper place at
the proper time

He motions to one of his Flunky Agents They dim the
lights - and a slide projector is turned on It displays
images of Jeffries’s lab

AGENT AGHENT (contd)
We took these pictures this past week
The lab and offices of Dr Jeffrey
Jeffries You can see here a
transmitter of some kind With whom
is he communicating A closer look
here - and a computer - we were
interrupted before we had a chance to
look at it

A slide of Sid making out with some floozy in the lab

AGENT AGHENT (contd)
If you would all turn to the back
section of your folders

The lights come up - the slide projector off
The Corporate Lackeys fumble through their papers

Among other pages the folders contain photo copied
messages from the time machine

AGENT AGHENT (contd)
What you are looking at gentlemen is
documentation of accidents These
documents were piled around the
laboratory What do they mean This
first one shows instructions on where
to locate a lost Alzheimer’s patient
The date at the top seems to signify
that it was received before the
patient had even disappeared Who
wrote this warning Was it a warning
It is my belief the country is being
duped This is a wicked plan -
hatched by a nameless coconspirator -
setting up Jeffrey Jeffries and his
idiot savant assistant Mr Hackenpfuss
to be heroes - dupes to be the object
of public adoration Lulling the
public into a false sense of
obligation

CORPORATE LACKEY
To what end

Agent Aghent shrugs to say he doesn’t know

AGENT AGHENT
We will see

INT JEFFRIES’S LAB - DAY

Jeffries and Sid work in the lab Sid sorts through a
pile of papers - they’re really stacking up

SID
Doc - what’s the deal we just got
over run with a bunch of strange

messages One after another - sent

out every morning - for the next 3
months

He plops down a large stack of messages

SID (contd)

They all say things like - “Everything

is okay” and “No worries so far
so on Were you expecting these

DR JEFFRIES

and

Something I thought of this morning

I was going to start
He picks up the stack of messages

DR JEFFRIES (contd)

--and I obviously followed through on

my plan
He sets the papers down

DR JEFFRIES (contd)

If we send back assurances from the
future - we can be sure everything is
working fine How far into the future

SID
We only got the one message

Jeffries - continuing to ignore Sid - has unbuckled his
seat-belt - he’s looking back at traffic

DR JEFFRIES
Go now Go now

SID
I figure if things didn’t go perfectly
the first time - we would have gotten
a second message - telling us to fix
whatever we screwed up the first time -
maybe warning us about the traffic
for instance Clever huh

DR JEFFRIES
Okay “A” this might be the first
time and “B” if not - suppose the
only reason it went so well the first
time is because you listened to me -
and got over into the other lane

I think you know I’m not

Agent Aghent shakes his head

SID (contd)
Were living on borrowed time

AGENT AGHENT
Explain it

Sid looks at his watch

SID
If you really want to know - I think
it’s safe to say You won’t be able
to do anything about it
(he takes a breath)
They came from the future

Sid looks around at everyone - disbelieving looks all
around

SID (contd)
The messages are warnings from the
future

The agents look around at each other THE CAR SLAMS TO
THE RIGHT - THEY ALL FALL OVER to the right

The car pulls forward Everyone sits up

AGENT AGHENT
The future I don’t believe it

SID
You believe what you want to believe
If the doctor thinks I’m dead - none
of this is going to matter soon
That’s the only reason I’m telling you
anything

AGENT AGHENT
Explain that
SID
He’ll send back a message warn me
not to enter the building

AGENT AGHENT
He can do that Alter the past

SID
He changes the past - it will change
our present

AGENT AGHENT
How does it work

SID
It’s hard to explain

AGENT AGHENT
Try

SID
Well Does anybody here remember
when Hanz Gubenstein invented time
travel

The agents look around at each other THE CAR SLAMS TO
THE LEFT - THEY ALL FALL OVER to the left

INT SID’S CAR - CONTINUOUS
Jeffries driving Sid’s car in bumper to bumper traffic

DR JEFFRIES
Okay - stay calm I have all the time
in the world - I’1l get back to the
lab Make this right

INT DIA SEDAN - DAY
In the back seat - Sid talks to the DIA Agents

SID

-when you send a message back the
instant it’s sent - you’ve changed the
past The present where we’re at now
is dictated by the actions we’ve taken
to get here so the instant you send
the message - you’ve also instantly
altered the present

EXT EXPRESSWAY - DAY
Jeffries honks his horn Still stuck in traffic
INT DIA SEDAN
SID
thanks to the resend feature - you
really have no memory of ever sending

that message

FLUNKIE AGENT 1
How is that possible
SID
You remember receiving it but the
computer resends anything it received
and you don’t ever have to resend a
message

FLUNKIE AGENT 2
But you already sent the message

SID
Sure - in the future - it was sent -
but you don’t have memory of what’s
happened in the future - it didn’t
happen yet

FLUNKIE AGENT 1
Go over it one more time

AGENT AGHENT
Enough already Your making my head
hurt
(to the driver)
Turn around - take us to the lab

I don’t know if I believe you - or
not But we’re going to check this

Only if you hurry

AGENT AGHENT
Ah huh

SID

The DIA Sedan stuck in traffic
EXT JEFFRIES’S LAB PARKING LOT - DAY

Sid’s car screeches to a stop Jeffries jumps out - runs
towards the door

INT LAB ENTRANCE - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
Jeffries runs up to the door - he runs awkwardly - his
hands are in his pockets - feeling for something He

stops - turns around - runs back outside

EXT JEFFRIES’S LAB PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS

Jeffries runs to the car - pulls on the door handle
It’s locked He hits the window exasperated Cups his
hands and puts his eyes to the window

He sees his KEYS STUCK IN THE IGNITION
Jeffries looks around on the ground
DR JEFFRIES
What difference does it make None
No difference None of this is going

to happen

He finds a small rock on the ground Picks it up throws
it at his window - CRASH

Jeffries reaches in - unlocks and opens the door He
grabs his keys and heads towards the lab

WRRRRUP A POLICE SIREN

POLICE OFFICER 1 (0S - MEGAPHONE)
Hold it right there

Jeffries stops in his tracks A police car has pulled
into the parking lot behind him Their lights are
flashing

POLICE OFFICER 1 (ON MEGAPHONE)
Put your hands where we can see them

Jeffries holds up his hands

POLICE OFFICER 1 (ON MEGAPHONE)
Turn around slowly

Jeffries turns around

The police get in their car Stop the lights and pull
away

Jeffries turns to go back inside Another car comes
screeching up - THE DIA SEDAN Jeffries stops Looks at
the car - confused

The Agents pile out Sid yells from the back seat

SID
(yelling)
Run Doc Doc get in the lab and stop
this crazy mess

DR JEFFRIES

SID
(yelling)
It’s a trap

Jeffries turns and scrambles inside THE AGENTS DRAW
WEAPONS AND FOLLOW

INT LAB ENTRANCE - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Jeffries runs in - can’t stop - SLAMS INTO THE DOOR
Fumbles with his keys - looks back at the entrance The
Agents blow through the doors Jeffries gets the lab
door open - falls inside - SLAMS THE DOOR BEHIND The
agents reach the door a few seconds late - IT’S LOCKED

EXT JEFFRIES’S LAB PARKING LOT - AT THAT MOMENT

THE FLUNKIE AGENTS kick at the door Agent Aghent stands
at a distance

to plead my case - before you finish
with your typing

Jeffries looks down at his hands on the keyboard

AGENT AGHENT

(whispering to the flunkies)
Find the main power feed - NOW And
kill it

(then shouting to Jeffries)
Dr Jeffries if you type in a message
now - you won’t know what’s going on
You’11 never know what this is all
about
Sid runs up to the scene
SID
Doc - he’s just stalling - he knows
about the machine

Aghent pulls out a gun - points it at Sid

AGENT AGHENT
You Quiet Now

SID
Hello Like I care
(shouting again)

Doc - assume I’m dead Send back a

message - we need to stay clear of

that warehouse fire It was a trap

almost in slow motion - tight in on the keyboard -

NOTHING HAPPENS

HE HITS THE KEY AGAIN AGAIN AGAIN Jeffries looks up -
THE MONITOR HAS GONE BLANK Jeffries looks around the
lab - several television monitors - all of them blank

THE POWER HAS BEEN CUT
Jeffries keeps pumping at the keyboard He gives up

DR JEFFRIES
Hell

AGENT AGHENT (0S)
We cut the power

INT LAB ENTRANCE - HALLWAY

AGENT AGHENT (contd)
Open the door Doctor Jeffries This
is the end game - I have a gun out
here on your assistant

DR JEFFRIES (0S)

AGENT AGHENT
Don’t be naive Open the door now

Jeffries unlocks the door and opens it

AGENT AGHENT (contd)
Good choice

INT JEFFRIES’S LAB

Sid and Agent Aghent file into the lab Agent Aghent
waves around his gun

AGENT AGHENT
Stay clear of that transmitter Move
over there

Aghent directs them - waving his gun

AGENT AGHENT (contd)

(speaks into his radio)
Reinstate the power

(to Jeffries)
Mr Hackenpfuss has filled me in on
this machine of yours - and while I’m
only just beginning to grasp it’s
logistics - I’m certain we can figure
out it’s intricacies before long

WRUP - The power comes back on - the monitors - the
computer

AGENT AGHENT (contd)
What to do with you two

He sighs Sid and Jeffries trade looks

AGENT AGHENT (contd)
Oh who am I trying to kid I’m going
to kill you both I’m afraid it has
to be done for the security of the
nation After all - I need to
protect our country’s Time Travel
Capabilities - can’t have any rogue
time terrorists Can’t have you
building another machine

DR JEFFRIES
You can’t just kill us I only let
you in here in order to save Sid’s
life

AGENT AGHENT
Well that was a mistake wasn’t it

BAM BAM AGENT AGHENT FIRES HIS WEAPON AND SHOOTS Sid
and Jeffries fall to the ground

DR JEFFRIES
Sid I screwed up this time

SID
No Doc It was me - I got cocky in
the car - I thought for sure you would
beat these guys back to the lab

They stop talking - apparently dead

The flunkies return to the room - head for the control
computer - and begin to investigate

AGENT AGHENT
Careful over there

Suddenly Jeffries SHOUTS IN PAIN and speaks - they all
stop and look at him

DR JEFFRIES (cont’d)
Weve made the same mistakes over and
over - it was inevitable Inevit-a-
ble

He barely croaks out the last words before croaking
himself

The Flunkies return to their investigation
SUDDENLY - Jeffries speaks again
DR JEFFRIES (contd)
It seems we only - we’ve only
accelerated our doom

Aghent pulls out his gun

AGENT AGHENT
Enough of this
BAM BAM He shoots at Jeffries
JEFFRIES IS DEAD

SID
Uncool You didn’t have to -

BAM BAM He shoots at Sid
SID IS DEAD

The Flunky Agents return to their work - two of them
rummaging through the scattered messages around the lab

The Third Flunky steps up to the Control computer

FLUNKIE AGENT 3
Sir - look at this

Agent Aghent holsters his weapon and steps over to the
computer

AGENT AGHENT
Don’t touch anything

FLUNKIE AGENT 3
It’s rebooting Whatever was on the
computer when it lost power - looks
like it can be recovered

Agent Aghent mulls this over

AGENT AGHENT
Don’t touch anything Let me think

He looks down at the floor - the dead bodies

FLUNKIE AGENT 3
What should I do

Tight in on the dead bodies - tight in on Jeffries’s
vacant eyes

AGENT AGHENT (0S)
Delete it Delete it all

The flunky types at the computer

AGENT AGHENT (contd)
I’m not entirely certain what we’re
messing with here See if you can
figure out how this works - if it does
what Mr Hackenpfuss said - we could
really screw ourselves - send back a
message into time and tip these two
off We can’t let that happen

FLUNKIE AGENT 3
Sir

AGENT AGHENT
No - we’ll have to continue to send
back a few messages - let them think
all is well - but we’1ll have to be

careful

RAP RAP Someone knocking on the door The Agents all

They open the door

Over his shoulder we see Aghent - the Flunkies - everyone
with their jaws agape

The stranger sees the dead bodies on the ground

STRANGER (0S)
(German accent)
Oh dear I’ma little late aren’t I

The stranger - his back still to us - reaches into his
pocket - he pulls out a small device - either a Palm
Pilot or a remote control

AGENT AGHENT
What Who What is going on-n-n-n-n-

Oooorup TIME HAS STOPPED Agent Aghent in mid sentence
- gun poised frozen The stranger’s thumb depressed on
the Palm Pilot

speed Door closes on the stranger Jeffries and Sid
getting shot - Agent Aghent entering the lab - he’s in
the hallway - blurp - stops - plays forward

Sid and Aghent startled by the voice - turn to see THE
STRANGER AND NO KIDDING - HE REALLY IS A DEAD RINGER
FOR ALBERT EINSTEIN

AGENT AGHENT
What the hell

STRANGER
You cut the power then convince him
to let you in Very clever

AGENT AGHENT
Somebody want to tell me why Albert
Einstein is standing in the hallway

DR JEFFRIES (0S)
(yelling from behind the
door)

Sid what’s happening

SID
Hard to say Doc It looks like
Albert Einstein but how old would
he be Uhm he’s looking good -

healthy

(to “Albert” )
What are you like a hundred twenty
years old

Aghent raises his gun towards the stranger

AGENT AGHENT
I don’t know who you are - but step
back now

STRANGER
Certainly - can I ask who I am
addressing

AGENT AGHENT
Agent Harry Aghent of the
Decentralized Intelligence Agency

STRANGER
Very good

The Stranger reaches into his pocket

AGENT AGHENT
Hands where I can see the---rpup

TIME STOPS - Rewinds at hyper speed - Jeffries running
down the hallway - breaking the window - stuck in rush
hour - back at the warehouse - the explosions play
backwards - Jeffries and Sid stuck in traffic

Sid and Jeffries stand outside their car

A large CHUNK of BURNING CEMENT rests on the hood of the
car

Sid dusts off his clothes
SID
No scratches on me Let’s call ita
good thing

Jeffries looks toward the roof of the warehouse

DR JEFFRIES
We’re too late

At a distance - our Albert Einstein look-a-like watches
Sid and Jeffries discuss their situation Sid runs off
into the building Jeffries yells after him “Albert”
reaches for his Palm Pilot - fiddles with it

TIME STOPS
TIGHT IN ON THE PALM PILOT - The Stranger’s thumb
depressed upon it

A LABEL On THE DEVICE “ KACKTGUCKNETCH ”

The device begins to pulse It makes a pulsing sound -
which continues over the action

We pull away - craning high into the sky As we pull
away from the palm pilot - we can see the Stranger moving
backwards ALL OF TIME is traveling BACKWARDS - from the
air we see Jeffries and Sid running backwards out of the
building

WE CONTINUE HIGH INTO THE AIR - A JET FLYING BACKWARD
The pulsing sound fades We’re high above the Earth
In outer space we can see the Earth rotating backwards
We fall back to earth faster - faster

Closer to the earth - the pulsing sound returns and gets
louder We fall towards a majestic mountain palace -
falling in through a sun window - We’re in a laboratory -
a large transmitterreceiver - hooked to a computer

It looks a little bit like Jeffries’s lab - but much more
swank and sophisticated

The Pulse screams at us - and stops

TIME Stops - BEGINS TO PLAY FORWARD - The computer
releases a chime - spits out a print-out sheet

A hand reaches down and picks up the paper Pull out -
it’s our Albert Einstein Look-A-like He reads the print-
out - shakes his head and makes a “tisk tisk” sound

INT JEFFRIES’S LAB - DAY

The lab is filled with Agent Aghent and his agents
Aghent raises his gun to shoot Jeffries and Sid

DR JEFFRIES
You can’t just kill us I only let
you in here in order to save Sid’s
life

AGENT AGHENT
Well that was a mistake wasn’t it

Jeffries cringes

STRANGER (0S)
Ahem - excuse me

They all turn to the door - standing there is the Albert
Einstein Look-a-like

AGENT AGHENT
Somebody want to tell me what Albert
Einstein is doing in the doorway

SID
(to the stranger)
What are you like 120 years old

DR JEFFRIES
My God You’re alive - it’s HANZ
GUBENSTEIN

Aghent points his weapon at the now identified Hanz
Gubenstein

AGENT AGHENT (contd)
Sorry Doctor Gubenstein - but you’ve
picked a bad time to show yourself
I have a Time Machine gap to protect

HANZ GUBENSTEIN
Harry put down your weapon or
I’m showing up in 1957 and slipping
Salt-Peter in your father’s Cherry
Coke

AGENT AGHENT
How do you know my name

HANZ GUBENSTEIN
I know everything about you Harry
Agent

AGENT AGHENT
It’s a hard “G”

HANZ GUBENSTEIN
I’ve known your name for fifty
years and I’ve tracked your
existence since your birth at Toledo
Memorial October 25 1957 Hmmm
Are you nervous Perhaps we could
clear the room to just the four of
us - I’m not kidding about the Salt-
Peter

Aghent considers - then he motions for the room to be
cleared

SID
(quietly to Jeffries)
Geez - You said he looks like him -
but he really looks like him

The room cleared Hanz approaches Aghent

HANZ GUBENSTEIN (cont’d)
You know who I am They’ve told you

AGENT AGHENT
I’m still playing catch-up But yeah
Mr Hackenpfuss said some things in
the car So your invention worked

HANZ GUBENSTEIN
Still does

SID
How old are you

HANZ GUBENSTEIN
104 I was a New Year Baby in 1900

SID
You look amazing

HANZ GUBENSTEIN
Thank you Not so much good genes -
but excellent health advice I’ve been
getting since 1936 I once died of a
heart attack in 1968 eh what did
we know about cholesterol for so many
years

Hanz has moved to look at the computer set-up

HANZ GUBENSTEIN (cont’d)
(inspecting the machine)
You have an auto resend you figured
that out very quickly - without even
trying Made things easier from the
start

He’s poking around with the machine and transmitter - the
power is still off

HANZ GUBENSTEIN (cont’d)

The other two didn’t figure it out for
years the first time but what does
that matter When you’ve invented a
Kacktgucknetch you just send back a
message and add the features you need
from the beginning I built a working
Macintosh in 1937

DR JEFFRIES
What did you just say What do you
mean the other two

AGENT AGHENT
How many of these machines are out
there

HANZ GUBENSTEIN
Oh there’s just the one now mine
But there were two others A
Frenchman who made a mistake -
confused his early self into thinking
his invention was a failure and
Hiroyugiko - in Japan - he didn’t like
the pressure set himself up with a
few small stock tips to help with
retirement then dismantled his
machine

DR JEFFRIES
Dr Gubenstein I don’t
understand if your device has
been working all this time - why
haven’t you been using it All the
wars - the disasters you could have
averted

HANZ GUBENSTEIN
How do you know Hitler didn’t win the
first time around How do you know
Reagan and Gorbachev didn’t blow up
the world in the 1980’s How do you
know worse didn’t happen

DR JEFFRIES
It was worse

HANZ GUBENSTEIN
Agent “Aghent ” do you understand the
power of this Machine You send back
a message - and you are wiping out
your own recent past But everything
you are at any given moment is a
product of your experiences up to that
moment So you are in effect wiping
your own present self out of
existence Replacing yourself with
someone new But will the new self be
better or worse Will the new world
you are creating be better or worse
It’s a leap of faith you must take -
because you will never know the out
come And your past self must trust a
person who doesn’t yet exist and
never will And you must act ona
message - with no memory - and no true
lesson learned to grow for the future

SID

Listen uh Doc -

(points to Hanz)
This Doc

(to Hanz)
you’ve got a working machine
right Why are we soft talking him
Can’t you just send back a note and
get here earlier so we avoid the
trap at the warehouse

HANZ GUBENSTEIN
But he’1ll find another way another
time

SID
Then send back a note further - we can
make some more drastic changes

HANZ GUBENSTEIN
Send back a note to when Mr
Hackenpfuss January 3rd Do you
want to live the last six months over
and over again Do you know how many
times you’ve already started over

DR JEFFRIES
But But what can we do He was
going to kill us

HANZ GUBENSTEIN
As a matter of fact he did kill
you right here once or twice and

also on a remote island Trust me -
if we keep going back he’1ll keep
doing it Destiny is persistent
Doctor and it can’t be changed by
going backwards We must move
forward

DR JEFFRIES
So what are you proposing

HANZ GUBENSTEIN
We will make him a partner - You will
join us Harry

DR JEFFRIES
Are you mad how can we trust him

HANZ GUBENSTEIN
Think about it we have a
Kacktgucknetch

AGENT AGHENT
I’m not joining anything

Hanz’s hand held machine begins to vibrate He pulls it
from his pocket looks at the screen then holds it up for
the others to see

HANZ GUBENSTEIN (cont’d)
A message from tomorrow It says “So
far so good”

They all exchange looks

HANZ GUBENSTEIN (cont’d)
Moving forward First mistake - you
need to put your machine on it’s own
generator
I’m not even going to discuss your
lack of security fix that
immediately

AGENT AGHENT
Wait a second - Did you hear me
earlier I’m not joining anything

Hanz looks at his device

HANZ GUBENSTEIN
Yes you are Okay - mistake number
two - well three if you count the
security thing - no wait - this is
mistake number one - Put the generator
at two and security is a close number
three Mistake number one is - You
need to keep track of all of your
messages better Anything you
receive - ANYTHING - EVER - needs to
be sent back to an original start date
- I’ve been picking up on all of your
messages myself - and sending them
back to myself - I have a filing
cabinet full of everything you’ve ever
sent - and once I have it stored - it

doesn’t matter if you re-write history
or reality - and you’ve been re-
writing a lot Do you people know
what youve been doing Do you know
how many times you’ve made the same
mistakes

Sid and Jeffries look at each other - shake their heads

HANZ GUBENSTEIN (cont’d)
Listen - there are two things to know
about the Kacktgucknetch One - you
can’t make major changes to History -
trust me I tried - it just gets
botched - So use it for the small
stuff - saving a drowning kid -
looking smart on a first date - but
stay away from anything with major
global impact - you’ll just draw
attention to yourself - and it will
all go wrong The second thing you
can’t go back too far the ripples
of your changes become too great
too unwieldy you should make small
changes - directed at changing the
immediate present Use the short term
past to build a strong future

He starts rambling about more things

SID
What about Lotteries

HANZ GUBENSTEIN
Well - it’s uncreative but an
effective way to secure some funds -
to live healthy - and improve
security Yeah you can win a few if
you want - that doesn’t cause too much
trouble

DR JEFFRIES
This message says stop after one

He points at the “DOOM” Message

HANZ GUBENSTEIN
That’s a rushed message - you were
under attack and things kept getting
worse

SID
So the lotteries How many times
Twice Three

Hanz mulls it over
HANZ GUBENSTEIN
I’ve found EIGHT is about the limit
before you get into trouble Yes
Eight

Sid’s eyes light up

SID
So Doc tell me about the island

DR JEFFRIES
What island

SID
Not you Doc This Doc
(referring to Hanz)

HANZ GUBENSTEIN
Well I never saw it you understand - I
only know what I can piece together
from your messages

SID
So what did we write about it

HANZ GUBENSTEIN
It was called Oohla Lampi And you
renamed it Jeffries Isle

SID
Jeffries Isle or Jeffries’s
Jeffreisez-ez-ez

They continue to talk - joke back and forth — maybe Sid sings

the Gilligan’s Island theme

We pull away from the resort Pull out — out - out — into Outer
Space and watch the earth rotate forward - then it stops — backs

up - then moves forward again
