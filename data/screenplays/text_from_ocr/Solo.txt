FADE IN

EXT CLOSTERMAN HOME - NIGHT

A Victorian home rests on the rocky coast of Maine Pine
trees sway gently in the darkness

We move slowly in on an upstairs window into

INT CLOSTERMAN HOME - BATHROOM - NIGHT

a bathroom featuring a large antique BATHTUB

ALICE (29 attractive intense) kneels next to the bathtub
gently bathing a BABY GIRL who wriggles in the shallow

water

ALICE
There you go Getting so clean

The baby looks up with a smile that melts Alice’s heart

CUT TO

EXT CLOSTERMAN HOME - DRIVEWAY - NIGHT

A POLICE CRUISER pulls into the driveway Maine State Trooper
MARK CLOSTERMAN (30s uniformed) steps out of the car

He walks onto the porch passing a festive SIGN announcing
“IT’S A GIRL”

Slinging his trooper jacket over his shoulder he walks
through the front door

CUT TO

INT CLOSTERMAN HOME - BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS
Alice continues rinsing the baby’s hair
MARK (0S)
(from downstairs)

I’m home

Alice smiles at the baby and playfully flicks some water onto
her The baby giggles
MARK (0S) (CONTD)
You two upstairs

Mark’s footsteps draw nearer as he climbs the stairs and
approaches the bathroom door

MARK (0S) (CONT’D)
Hello

Still no response from Alice The DOOR begins to open
MARK (0S) (CONTD)
Is somebody getting a bath in
here
Mark STOPS SHORT in the doorway looking at Alice
MARK (CONTD)
(alarmed)
Who the hell are you
Mark PALES seeing the DEAD BODY of his WIFE (MARY
CLOSTERMAN) lying on the floor behind Alice SOAKED WITH
BLOOD

MARK (CONTD)
No

Before Mark can react Alice RAISES A HANDGUN

-and FIRES

Mark is thrown back against the tile wall a ragged hole in
his chest He slides slowly to the floor a look of shock on

his dead face

The baby WAILS at the loud noise Alice gently lifts the wet
child into her arms calming her

ALICE
Shhh it’s all right

She rocks the baby slowly and wraps her in her dead father’s
TROOPER JACKET for warmth

ALICE (CONTD)
(gently kisses the baby)
Mommy’s here

FADE OUT

FADE IN
EXT PENOBSCOT BAY - DAY

We move swiftly across Penobscot Bay a vast Atlantic
waterway dotted with green wooded islands

The sun reflects off the gentle waves on a glorious Maine
summer afternoon

“18 Years Later”

In the distance a battered “PULLING BOAT” (25-foot aluminum
sailboat) bobs listlessly on the blue water

CUT TO

EXT PULLING BOAT - DAY

Close on a male hand using a charcoal pencil to sketch a
WOMANS FACE The hand belongs to

TOBY BURNS (18 attractive intelligent) who sits in the bow
of the boat sketching in a LEATHERBOUND SKETCH BOOK

TEN TEENAGERS sit glumly in the boat with Toby They’re on a
Outward Bound wilderness trip and their leader KAYE (28
tanned hot) sits at the tiller steering

Kaye is the woman Toby is sketching with intricate attention
to detail the shadows on her face her eyes focused on the
horizon etc

Tobys friend CAMERON (18 lovable cad) glances at the sketch
and then at Toby

CAMERON
(whispers imitating Kaye)
“God Toby you’ve really captured
my essence I have to make love to
you now”

TOBY
(quietly)
That routine never gets old for
you does it

CAMERON
No but you know what is old Her
As in ten years older than you
TOBY

I sketch seals and bell-buoys too
Cameron It doesn’t mean I want to
have sex with them

(Cameron laughs)
Getting laid is the last thing on
my mind We’ve been out here two
weeks I’ve got salt in every pore
fold and crack of my body

CAMERON
How many cracks do you have

Toby rolls his eyes and continues his sketch

CAMERON (CONTD)
You know I think I think you were
smart to come on this trip Tobe

TOBY
Why is that

CAMERON
You strike me as a bit sheltered
frankly and getting salty and
learning to rough it is good for
someone like you

TOBY
Crapping over the side of a boat in
front of other people is not good
for anyone

CAMERON
(shrugs)
My grampa lived to ninety

Toby smiles and adds a detail to the sketch of Kaye Then

TOBY
It wasn’t exactly my choice to come
here Cam It was this or other
problems

CAMERON

(intrigued)
Wait are you telling me that Mr
Prep School is a member of the
Court-Ordered Adventure Club like I
am

(Toby says nothing and

keeps sketching)
Why am I finding this out two weeks
in I told you on day one
TOBY
(shrugs)
Hey if you’re proud of being
busted selling weed more power to
you

CAMERON
Growing Tobe Not selling There’s
a difference
(beat)
What are you in for

Toby says nothing

A beat

Beat

CAMERON (CONTD)
Come on

TOBY
I hit my stepfather

CAMERON
You can get arrested for hitting
your stepfather

TOBY
(bitter)
You can if he’s an attorney and an
asshole and if your mother cares
more about his money than her own
kids yeah

CAMERON
Well that sounds like a charming
home life Tobe Why don’t you live
with your dad

TOBY
He died when I was twelve

Cameron nods slowly

CAMERON
How

Toby adds another detail to the sketch

TOBY
Let’s just say he died three days
after she left him and leave it at
that all right

Cameron stares at him sensing Toby’s implication - that his
father killed himself

CAMERON
Jesus

TOBY
How’s that for “sheltered”

Cameron pats Toby on the back

CAMERON
(smiles louder)
I stand corrected you’re a fucking
mess Welcome to the club

KAYE (0S)
(from the stern)
Gentlemen language

CAMERON
(gives her a wave)
Sorry Kaye you’re right A boat’s
no place for sailor talk

Kaye gives him a look then rises to her feet

KAYE
(addressing the group)
Okay everybody listen up You all
know what today is You’re starting
your solos so let’s go over how
this is going to work

There are assorted reactions among the teens Some are
enthused others groan

KAYE (CONTD)
Youre each going to camp on a
different island by yourselves for
three days
(gestures around the
various islands)
There are more than three thousand
islands in Maine most of them
state land almost all uninhabited
Weve never used the same islands
twice so I honestly can’t tell you
too much about what to expect from
yours except that given the amount
of rain we’ve had this month you
will find water if you look for it
(beat)
(MORE )
KAYE (CONTD)

The point of a solo is
introspection It’s a chance to
think about what you’ve learned so
far on the trip and to use your
new skills to survive

(beat)
Youll have your sleeping bag a
tarp a knife a bag of trail mix
and some iodine for treating the
water you find That’s it

TEENAGE GIRL
What do we do for three days

KAYE
(shrugs)
Sit Think Explore Survive It’s
entirely up to you

Cameron makes a “jerking-off” motion Toby stifles a laugh
and draws a look from Kaye

KAYE (CONTD)
Is there a problem Toby

TOBY
No problem at all Anything
involving dry land is fine by me

Others mumble in agreement Kaye holds up a ROAD FLARE

KAYE
If there’s an emergency you’ll
each have a flare that you can use
to signal a passing boat

TOBY
What boats The only boat we’ve
seen in the past week is this piece
of
(off her sharp look)
-impeccable craftsmanship

KAYE
Don’t worry I’ve been doing this
for six years and no one’s ever lit
their flare I expect to keep that
record intact got it

Cameron looks toward an ISLAND they’re nearing It’s
basically just rocks (covered with seagull shit) and a few
patches of trees
CAMERON
(laughs)
Sweet
(to Kaye)
Who gets this paradise

Kaye smiles at him smugly Camerons face FALLS

CAMERON (CONTD)
Not a chance in hell

CUT TO

EXT PENOBSCOT BAY - DAY

Cameron stands on the rocks holding his backpack as the
boat sails away from him

CAMERON
(yelling at the receding
boat annoyed)
I’m not gonna forget this Kaye

Kaye smiles to herself Toby grins back at Cameron and gives
him a sarcastic “thumbs up”

CAMERON (CONTD)
(calls)
Keep smiling asshole I hope your
island has bears

Cameron examines his grim surroundings Hundreds of SEAGULLS
eye him curiously

CAMERON (CONTD)
(glum)
Birdshit Island Super

CUT TO

EXT PENOBSCOT BAY - DAY

From afar the boat seems only a speck as it crosses the
vast calm expanse of Penobscot Bay

CUT TO

EXT BOAT - DAY

Toby looks back at Cameron’s island now far in the distance
behind them
KAYE (0S)
Toby
(points to an ISLAND
ahead)
This is you

Toby begins gathering his belongings Just then the boat is
caught in a SWIFT CURRENT and Kaye struggles to keep it on
course

KAYE (CONTD)
(to the group)

Hold on guys
(to Toby)

Pull in the sail

Toby pulls in the sail a few feet

KAYE (CONTD)
(getting back on course)
The current seems pretty strong in
this channel Toby I wouldn’t go
swimming we’d never find you

TOBY

(dry)
Fantastic

Toby studies his ISLAND which is half a mile long and
covered with a thick blanket of PINE TREES

At the far end a decrepit LIGHTHOUSE looms on a high rocky
bluff It’s clearly not a working lighthouse - the structure
itself looks anything but stable

TOBY (CONTD)
Can I shack up in there

KAYE
Not unless you want it to collapse
on your head It’s abandoned it’s
probably been rotting there a
hundred years

The boat draws nearer to the island

CUT TO

EXT ROCKY BEACH - AFTERNOON

The boat bumps up against the shore and Toby carefully steps
out carrying his backpack Kaye hands him a FLARE and
smiles

KAYE
Toby I feel like you of anyone
will get something out of this
experience

TOBY
(nods)
Three days without being seasick

Kaye fixes him with a look

KAYE

Look it’s pretty obvious that it
wasn’t your decision to come on
this trip

(Toby says nothing)
But this solo is all yours this
island is all yours You’re in
complete control here Toby And
you might just find that with no
one telling you what to do you’1ll
learn something about who you are

Toby listens digesting her words

KAYE (CONTD)

So when I come back in three days
I don’t want to find “Toby who
doesn’t want to be here” or Toby of
“Toby and Cameron” I want to find
you

(beat)
Get to know yourself Believe in
yourself That’s the point of a
solo Understand

TOBY
(smiles)
I understand you’re telling me what
to do on my island

Kaye rolls her eyes

KAYE
See you in three days smart guy
(steps back onto the boat)
Don’t forget to hang up your food
bag or you’ll be up to your neck
in critters

Toby shoves the boat off the shore and watches it sail off

Toby looks around at the island his home for the next three
days and then picks up his gear and walks across the rocky
beach into the trees

At the other end of the island the decrepit LIGHTHOUSE
stands sentinel

CUT TO

EXT TOBY’S CAMPSITE - AFTERNOON

In a small clearing surrounded by pines Toby has constructed
a rudimentary TENT using his plastic tarp

Toby gathers twigs and dry grass and places them inside a
ring of large stones He holds his Swiss Army knife’s
MAGNIFYING GLASS near the dried grass focusing the last rays
of afternoon SUNLIGHT

TOBY
(keeping his hand still)
Come on

A small wisp of SMOKE appears and soon a FLAME flickers to
life

TOBY (CONTD)
There we go Fuego

He gently blows on the flames and adds more sticks Soon he
has a pleasant little fire going

Toby rises to his feet and looks around at his little camp
satisfied

TOBY (CONT’D)
Not bad Tobe Not bad at all
(frowns shakes his head)
An hour in and you’re talking to
yourself Good on ya

He looks around the dark trees seeming to feel the solitude
finally There’s no movement at all

He’s really alone
TOBY (CONTD)
(yells for fun)

There’s no sound but the wind in the trees

TOBY (CONTD)
COCK AND BALLS

Still no sound Toby laughs at himself but as he turns
around

Theres a RUSTLING in the trees behind him

Toby goes silent listening Something’s moving around in the
woods

Toby grabs a thick STICK and holds it like a club waiting
Silence
Toby THROWS the stick in the direction of the sound

and something BURSTS OUT of the UNDERBRUSH Toby JUMPS
BACK alarmed

It’s a JACKRABBIT which races past him and skids to a stop
at the other side of the camp looking at Toby

TOBY (CONTD)
(puts a hand to his chest)
Jesus Christ

The rabbit looks at him for a moment its little nose
twitching

TOBY (CONTD)
You almost gave me a heart attack
little guy

Toby takes a step toward the rabbit which edges back

TOBY (CONTD)
Don’t be afraid It’s okay

Toby pulls out his bag of TRAIL MIX and pours some into his
hand

TOBY (CONTD)
Want some food

Toby tosses some trail mix onto the ground near the rabbit
TWO SQUIRRELS then creep out of the underbrush intrigued
The three animals quickly eat the scattered nuts and look to
Toby for more

TOBY (CONTD)
(closes the bag)
Sorry guys I have to live on this

The animals suddenly GO STILL their eyes wide their ears
alert A moment later they DART AWAY clearly frightened
Unnerved Toby looks into the trees behind him just as

-there’s MOVEMENT deep in the woods but its gone before
Toby can see what it was

Whatever it was it was a hell of a lot bigger than a rabbit

Toby stares into the trees There’s only silence except for
the wind in the leaves

Toby shrugs it off and walks down a narrow DEER PATH to a
granite outcropping overlooking the water He sits at the
base of a pine tree and sighs relaxing

His camp is made The fire’s lit Life is good

CUT TO

EXT ISLAND - EVENING

The sun sets over the horizon CROWS fly from the trees and
glide past the lighthouse

Night is coming

CUT TO

EXT WOODS - NIGHT

Toby pushes through dense dry branches with a WATER BOTTLE
in his hand

It’s hard to see in the darkness and branches scratch Toby’s
face Hearing the sound of RUNNING WATER just up ahead Toby
pushes the final few feet through the branches and finds

--a small flowing STREAM

Toby kneels and begins to fill his water bottle When it’s
full he holds it up and looks at the DEBRIS floating inside

TOBY
Excuse me waiter There’s dirt and
animal piss in my water

Toby adds three drops of IODINE and shakes the bottle to mix
it up He then takes a long sip wincing at the taste

Toby leans over the stream again to top off the bottle but
when he looks into the water

Theres a REFLECTION of a pale FACE WATCHING HIM FROM THE
TREES

Toby REELS backwards startled His eyes whip toward the
large OAK TREE where the face seemed to be but it’s GONE

TOBY (CONTD)
Who’s there

Silence

Toby jumps to his feet and moves toward the tree carefully
He waits a moment and then quickly steps around the tree and
finds

--no one The woods are empty All is quiet

Unnerved Toby grabs his water bottle and hurries away When
he’s out of sight we slowly pan UP THE OAK TREE to a dark

shadowy recess between the limbs

where a set of DIRT-SMEARED FINGERS supports the weight of
someone hiding completely MOTIONLESS in the shadows

FADE TO

EXT TOBY’S CAMPSITE - NIGHT

An uneasy Toby lies in his sleeping bag by the crackling
fire which casts a warm glow onto the trees but also
emphasizes the deep darkness of the woods beyond

Toby pulls out his sketch book and opens to a fresh page

He carefully draws the oak tree by the stream and sketches
the FACE he saw between the branches

He closes his eyes and thinks back and then adds a few more
touches to the face

A TWIG breaks in the woods behind him

Toby throws open his sleeping bag where he has several
STONES gathered He jumps to his feet and HURLS the first
stone into the darkness It CLATTERS through branches and
underbrush

TOBY
(loud)
If anybody’s there I swear you’re
going to get one of these in your
goddamn face
He HURLS another stone It crashes through the dark woods

Toby listens for movement but hears nothing He picks up his
LAST STONE and hurls it into the dark woods

But this time theres NO SOUND The rock doesnt seem to
LAND or crash through branches Theres only SILENCE

Toby goes still

TOBY (CONTD)
What the hell

Toby pulls a burning stick from the fire as a TORCH and
carefully moves toward the treeline

CUT TO

EXT WOODS - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS
Toby walks into the dark woods holding the burning stick

He looks around warily conscious of every small noise He
moves slowly through the trees squinting into the darkness

The torchlight casts shadows among the skeletal tree
branches swaying gently in the breeze

Toby stands still listening then allows himself to relax
TOBY
There’s nobody here Stop being

such a pussy

Toby slowly turns back toward his camp But he FREEZES when
he sees

--the STONE resting on top of a narrow TREE STUMP

He stares in disbelief There’s no possible way it could have
just landed like that

Its almost like someone CAUGHT it

Toby looks again into the darkness but sees only the looming
trees

TOBY (CONTD)
(yells)
Stay the hell away from my camp
You hear me
Only silence answers him

CUT TO

EXT TOBY’S CAMPSITE - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

Toby climbs back into his sleeping bag unnerved

He stares at the sketch he made of the terrifying PALE FACE
he saw in the trees Even in its abstraction the face in the

sketch has piercing eyes and looks vaguelyfemale

Toby stares at the sketch All is quiet Move slowly in on
the crackling fire and

FADE TO

EXT TOBY’S CAMPSITE - MORNING

The fire is now ASH It’s MORNING

Toby JOLTS AWAKE as if from a nightmare

He stretches his back sore from the hard ground Toby unzips
his sleeping bag and wearily rises to his feet His eye then

lands on

TOBY
Son of a bitch

the baggie of TRAIL MIX which is SHREDDED and EMPTY
devoured by critters

TOBY (CONTD)
(calls into the woods)
Thank you very much for that
He kicks the bag angrily
TOBY (CONTD)
(to the trees)
Maybe I’1l1 eat you you little
bastards

Toby angrily walks out of the camp toward the beach

CUT TO

EXT ROCKY BEACH - DAY

Toby moves along the rocks at the edge of the woods looking
for anything to eat He finds an old rusted Mercury
OUTBOARD ENGINE discarded in a bed of sea grass

Several small CRABS scurry out from underneath Toby picks up
one of the crabs and watches it wriggle

TOBY
(frowns at its small size)
Got any big brothers

Toby releases the crab which scurries away Toby’s stomach
rumbles

He takes a step and WINCES from a sharp pain in his foot
Looking down he sees he’s cut his toe on a MUSSEL SHELL

TOBY (CONTD)
Damn it

He’s about to throw the shell away but he pauses He looks
toward the water realizing there are MUSSELS EVERYWHERE
Thousands of them

TOBY (CONTD)
(smiles)
No way

CUT TO

EXT TOBY’S CAMPSITE - DAY

The outboard engine’s metal COVER sits on top of the fire
like a COOKING POT filled to the brim with MUSSELS and
boiling water

Toby pries open a mussel and eats the meat then tosses the
shell onto a growing pile nearby

TOBY
(pleased)
“Mussel beach” All right

The squirrel pokes its head out of the brush Toby frowns at
seeing the little thief again

TOBY (CONTD)
Scram shithead You’re banned for
life

The squirrel keeps staring at him Toby chews smiling at the
defiant little animal

TOBY (CONTD)
You know what Hold that pose

Toby leans over and grabs his charcoal pencil Not seeing his
sketch book he lifts up his sleeping bag and looks
underneath It’s not there

TOBY (CONTD)
Where’s my book

Toby looks around his campsite and then searches his BAG The
book is GONE

TOBY (CONT’D)
No no no

Toby glares into the deep woods
TOBY (CONTD)
(yells)
I know you took my book
(silence)
What the hell’s your problem
Toby’s eyes scan the trees
A SHADOWY MOVEMENT deep in the woods
TOBY (CONTD)
I see you
(storms toward the trees)
Hey

He suddenly bends over in PAIN He sinks to his knees
holding his STOMACH

Toby WINCES as another AGONIZING wave of pain hits him
He slowly looks back at the MUSSEL SHELLS on the ground

TOBY (CONTD)
Oh shit

He remains still for a moment steadying himself but then
lurches out of sight into the underbrush We hear him VOMIT

A few moments later Toby stumbles back into the camp and
slumps onto the ground pale and weak

Toby’s head lolls to the side his face sweating He looks
AWFUL It’s clear - he’s got FOOD POISONING

Toby tries to get to his knees but he’s too disoriented He
looks into the woods

TOBY’S POV - His vision warped by nausea and lightheadedness
he sees the SHADOWY FIGURE in the distant woods

TOBY (CONT’D)
(weakly)
Son of a bitch

Toby struggles to stand but another wave of PAIN grips him
and he slumps to the ground

His eyes begin to close his body seeming to shut down
TOBY (CONTD)
(faintly)
Give me back my book

Toby’s eyes close fully He’s passed out

FADE TO

EXT TOBY’S CAMPSITE - EVENING

It’s evening - hours have passed

Toby stirs awake the color having returned to his skin He
sits up groaning and reaches for his WATER BOTTLE but it’s
EMPTY

Toby rises to his feet and lifts the cooking pot off the dead
campfire He heaves the remaining mussels into the brush

then drops the pot limply on the ground

Toby’s STOMACH GROWLS adding insult to injury

TOBY
(to himself)
You’re gonna fucking starve out

here
Rubbing his eyes Toby looks up at the stars overhead
TOBY (CONTD)
(yells miserable)

Fuckthisplace

Toby’s own ECHO from the dark woods seems to remind him of
his BIGGER problem

He scans the trees around the camp but there’s no sign of
the intruder It doesn’t seem to comfort him though because
now he knows for sure

Someone else is on this island

CUT TO

EXT WOODS - NIGHT

Toby kneels by the stream to fill his water bottle

The woods around him are dark except for the moonlight
streaming in from above The sound of crickets is all that

can be heard

Toby stares at the oak tree where he saw the face but
there’s no one there He heads back toward his camp

CUT TO

EXT WOODS - NIGHT

Toby moves through thick branches but slows to a stop
unsure if he’s going the right way All the trees look the
same in every direction

TOBY
Shit

He takes a few steps in one direction but then stops again
looking around To his left there appears to be a clearing
up ahead

Toby pushes through the branches

EXT MOONLIT CLEARING - NIGHT

Toby steps into the clearing He immediately stops his eyes
going wide

At the center of the clearing are STALKS of CORN Toby moves
quickly to the stalks examining them

TOBY
(finding NO ears of corn)
Nothing Youre kidding me

He then spots an ear of corn on the ground and grabs it but
when he peels back the leaves it’s ROTTEN and crawling
with MAGGOTS

Toby quickly DROPS the corn repulsed

He then looks at corn stalks again and he realizes

theyre in PERFECT ROWS Someone clearly CARES FOR these
Toby looks around the dark trees His eye then lands on
a small shrub growing wild in the woods

The shrub has PLUMP BLACK BERRIES hanging from it Toby picks
a few of the berries and examines their shiny black skin
gleaming in the moonlight

Toby sniffs the berries and is about to take a wary bite of
one when

MADELEINE (0S)
(faint female whisper)
Dont

Toby SPINS startled He scans the dark trees around him on
edge

TOBY
(calls)
Who’s there

Toby remains motionless trying to discern any movement in
the trees

TOBY (CONTD)
I know you’re there you just spoke
to me

Toby looks around but sees only darkness He begins to back
away subtly slipping the berries into his pocket

TOBY (CONT’D)
Listen I’m just camping I don’t
want any trouble

Toby looks around the dark trees unsure if the person is
still there

TOBY (CONT’D)
But bring my book back It’s
important to me
(silence)
Hello

Toby frowns frustrated and begins walking out of the
clearing angry at being toyed with

MADELEINE (0S)
(faint from the trees)
You can’t eat those

Toby spins now officially PISSED OFF

TOBY
What these
(pulls out the berries
stuffs them in his mouth)
Mmm those are goddamned tasty

Toby looks around searching for the source of the voice in
the trees

TOBY (CONT’D)
(mouth still full)
Im sick of this hide and seek
shit Where the hell are you

Toby listens still chewing the berries and after a moment
he hears

gentle BREATHING Close to him

Toby slowly turns and looks closely at a nearby tree with
skeletal branches He PALES as he realizes

they’re not all branches

TOBY (CONTD)
Oh my god

Theres a PERSON standing MOTIONLESS within their fingers
and limbs angled to RESEMBLE the branches BLENDING IN
PERFECTLY

The figure steps forward through the branches and for the
first time Toby lays eyes on

MADELEINE (18 a stunning natural beauty) Her sparse
sundress is hand-sewn and ill-fitting and her long hair
cascades over tanned fit shoulders and arms Every inch of
this girl is infused with raw sex appeal

Madeleine remains in the shadows uncomfortable at having
revealed herself

MADELEINE
(re Toby’s mouthful)
That’s Nightshade If you swallow
it you’ll die

Toby STOPS CHEWING and quickly SPITS out the mouthful
repulsed He wipes his tongue with his sleeve

Recovering Toby seems to realize for the first time how
unbelievably HOT Madeleine is

TOBY
Thanks

Toby squints trying to see her better but Madeleine steps
back into the shadows self-conscious

MADELEINE
Don’t look at me

TOBY
Why not

Madeleine doesn’t answer Instead she begins to back away
into the darkness

TOBY (CONT’D)
Where are you going

MADELEINE
Stay away from the lighthouse
Don’t let her see you

TOBY
Who

Madeleine looks back at him

MADELEINE
Mother

Madeleine recedes further into the darkness Toby desperate
for something to say points to the shrub

TOBY
Hey wait a second If I can’t eat
those what can I eat I’ve got no
food at all

Madeleine looks back at him then kneels and picks up TWO
STONES Toby watches her confused

TOBY (CONTD)
I don’t think I can eat those
either

Madeleine looks around the trees for a moment listening

-and then WHIPS A STONE RIGHT PAST TOBY’S HEAD

TOBY (CONT’D)
Jesus

The stone HITS a THICKET OF BUSHES A RABBIT takes off from
the thicket and sprints away from them It’s forty feet
away fifty

Madeleine HURLS the next STONE which hurtles through the air
like a laser-guided missile and HITS THE SPEEDING RABBIT The
rabbit tumbles over the ground and rolls to a stop limp
TOBY (CONTD)
Oh my god
(in complete disbelief)
You did not just do that
He stares at the motionless rabbit for an extended moment
TOBY (CONTD)
(turns back)
Where did you learn how to

But Madeleine is GONE Toby looks around at the dark and
empty woods

TOBY (CONTD)
(calls)
Hello

The woods are silent Once again Toby is all alone in the
darkness

CUT TO

EXT ISLAND - NIGHT

The moon hangs low over the wooded island The ominous
silhouette of the lighthouse looms in the distance

CUT TO

EXT TOBY’S CAMPSITE - NIGHT

The limp RABBIT lies on the ground by Toby’s campfire
Toby taps his KNIFE on his palm uncomfortable with the
prospect of cutting it up Toby finally leans forward and

reaches for the rabbit but

it TWITCHES Toby pulls his hand back He studies the
rabbit looking for other signs of life

TOBY
If you’re alive do something else

The rabbit doesn’t move for a moment but then its EYES
slowly flutter open

The rabbit SCRAMBLES to its feet and looks at Toby
disoriented and frightened

TOBY (CONTD)
(sighs )
Get out of here
The rabbit doesn’t move
TOBY (CONTD)
(kicks dirt at it)

Go before I change my mind

The rabbit DARTS into the underbrush and disappears Toby
wraps his jacket around himself cold and hungry

He walks down the narrow deer path to the
ROCK OUTCROPPING

and watches as thick FOG moves slowly across the water toward
the shore

Toby looks toward the dark hulking lighthouse at the other
end of the island

TOBY (CONTD)
“Uninhabited” island my ass

As Toby turns to walk back to his camp
A GENTLE SPLASH in the water just off shore

Toby looks out over the water squinting to see through the
fog

At first there’s nothing to see until a DARK SHAPE
emerges

It’s a small antique ROWBOAT drifting just off shore
Toby climbs down the embankment to the rocky beach and walks
to the water’s edge He looks out at the boat unable to

tell whether there might be someone lying inside

TOBY (CONTD)
Hello

No answer

Toby wades into the cold dark water drawing closer and
closer to the drifting boat

Reaching it Toby lays his hands on the side of the boat and
looks inside

It’s EMPTY

Toby glances around the dark water and then begins to pull
the boat to shore

A RIPPLE in the water near him

Toby freezes watching and listening

Tiny bubbles float to the surface Somethings under the
water

Toby quickly turns to get to shore but

-a FIGURE LURCHES OUT OF THE WATER Toby SCREAMS as the
figure GRABS HIM and PULLS HIM UNDER

The water slowly goes CALM
Toby then BURSTS up again wheezing

TOBY (CONTD)
ASSHOLE

The figure surfaces as well It’s CAMERON who laughs
hysterically at Toby’s fright

CAMERON
(mocking)
Rawr Sucka

Toby catches his breath as Cameron shivers in the cold night
air grinning

CAMERON (CONTD)
God damn your girly scream was
totally worth freezing my nipples
off

(looks down at his chest)
Seriously I could cut glass with
these things

Toby points at Cameron pissed

TOBY
You take douchebag to a whole new
level Cam

Cameron bows politely at the “compliment” but then sees
Toby’s frowning face

CAMERON
Relax I’1ll make it up to you I
brought you a present

Cameron reaches into the rowboat and holds up an old painted
LOBSTER BUOY

TOBY
(unimpressed)
Sweet I’ve always wanted a slime-
covered buoy

Cameron points to a ROPE attached to the buoy which hangs
into the water He reels in the rope and pulls up a large
METAL CAGE with two LOBSTERS inside

CAMERON
Voila

Toby looks into the trap surprised

TOBY
Aren’t lobsterman allowed to shoot
people who steal their traps

CAMERON

It’s a very ambiguous law
actually

(off Toby’s look)
Dude even they don’t know if
they’re allowed to kill you so
most of them just shoot blanks to
keep the myth alive

TOBY
Most That’s comforting

Cameron frowns at his friend

CAMERON
Are you actually turning down a
lobster dinner Tobe I won’t even
make you put out

Toby reluctantly laughs Cameron walks past him toward the
trees As Toby follows

TOBY
Say I’ve got a shitload of wild
mussels here if you want to take
some They’re amazing

CAMERON
Oh yeah

They disappear into the trees

CUT TO

EXT TOBY’S CAMPSITE - NIGHT

Cameron places the engine-lid “cooking pot” on the fire Toby
waits nearby holding the two lobsters

TOBY
Don’t you think you’re missing the
point of a “solo”

CAMERON
Like I care My island blows

TOBY
Where’d you find the boat

CAMERON
It was washed up on the shore when
I got there I’ve been sleeping
under it because I’m getting
crapped on by seagulls every night

TOBY
(puts lobsters in the pot)
Isn’t that supposed to be good
luck

CAMERON
Looking like the floor of a porno
theater I don’t need that kind of
luck

Cameron adds more sticks to the fire

TOBY
Keep the fire small I don’t want
to draw attention to us

CAMERON
News flash Tobe there’s nobody
here

TOBY
That’s what I thought too
CAMERON
Ah I see
(intrigued)

Am I to surmise that Mister “Youre
missing the point of a solo” has
had some company here
(Toby smiles and stirs the
lobsters)
What kind of company pray tell

TOBY
You wouldn’t believe me if I told
you

Cameron raises an eyebrow curious

CAMERON
Oh

TIME CUT TO

EXT TOBY’S CAMPSITE - LATER
Cameron stares at Toby in DISBELIEF

CAMERON
We’re switching islands Right now

Toby laughs and eats a piece of lobster meat They’re well
into their meal Shells are scattered on the ground

CAMERON (CONTD)
I’m serious Toby This is crap
I’m stuck on a birdshit-covered
rock and you’re chillin’ in the
Blue Lagoon with some hot feral
Amazon

(Toby laughs)

Don’t laugh I fucking hate you

Toby eats a bite of lobster meat

TOBY
Honestly the whole situation’s
kind of creepy She lives with her
mother in the lighthouse

CAMERON
So

TOBY
That place is a ruin it’s falling
apart No one’s supposed to live
there

CAMERON
Maybe they’re “on the lam”

(Toby rolls his eyes)
Seriously maybe the mom’s some
survivalist nut or the daughter’s
a Baby Lucy or something

TOBY
Am I supposed to know what that
means

CAMERON

Only if you’re from Maine It’s
local lore

TOBY
I thought Maine lore was ghosts and
killer clowns

CAMERON
That’s fiction Baby Lucy’s real
(laughs)
And youd better hope it’s not her
because youd be sharing an island
with Alice Malkin and you sure as
hell don’t want that

Off Toby’s confusion Cameron wipes his mouth and pokes at
the fire

CAMERON (CONTD)
Back in the 80’s this housewife
Alice went nuts one night She
found out her husband was paying
nightly visits to their daughters
room if you catch my drift

TOBY
So she killed him

Cameron frowns at the interruption

CAMERON
I don’t know what qualifies as
“lore” where you come from Tobe
but we have much higher standards
here in Maine Let me finish
(Toby rolls his eyes)
(MORE )

CAMERON (CONTD)
Alice doesn’t just kill her
husband she kills her daughter
too Poisons their dinner and sits
and watches them eat it

TOBY
Jesus

CAMERON
Needless to say Alice ends up in
the nuthouse until one day when no
one’s looking she literally
strolls out the front door and is
never seen again

(leans in)

But that night half a mile away
someone walks into the home of
friggin’ State Trooper shoots him
and his wife and steals their baby
girl

TOBY
(getting it)
Baby Lucy

CAMERON

(nods)
“Baby Lucy” Closterman Basically
the psycho bitch Alice stole a baby
girl to replace the one she killed

(satisfied)
Now thats fucking lore boy Maine-
style

TOBY
You must be so proud

CAMERON

Anyway they never found Alice or
the kid So Baby Lucy’s kind of a
local celebrity I went as her for
Halloween once

(off Toby’s look)
You know diaper pacifier fake
blood

TOBY
That’s messed up Even for you

CAMERON
Yeah I got a lot of doors slammed
in my face

Faint tinny MUSIC begins to play - “Used to Love Her by
Guns n Roses To Toby’s surprise Cameron unzips a small
waterproof pouch and pulls out a CELL PHONE - the music is
his RING TONE

CAMERON (CONTD)

(into phone)

Yo

(strains to hear frowns)
Dude forget it I’m not telling
you where the other plants are

(listens)
Because you’ll smoke them that’s
why Listen I’ve only got one bar
of service here I can’t hear shit
I’m hanging up

(listens rolls his eyes)
Love you too Pop

Cameron hangs up the phone and puts it in his pocket

TOBY
You brought a phone

CAMERON
(smiles)
I brought a lot of things

Cameron reaches into the pouch again and pulls out a JOINT

TOBY
(re the phone)
Maybe I should call the police
about that girl

CAMERON
(laughs)
“Help there’s some chick on an
island growing vegetables”
(off Toby’s look)
She’s not Baby Lucy relax

Cameron pokes the tip of the joint into the fire to light it

CAMERON (CONTD)
Let’s get baked amigo I’ve got a
long trip back and there’s weather
coming

TOBY
(looks up at the sky)
What are you talking about It’s
beautiful
(MORE )

TOBY (CONTD)
(Cameron shrugs)
What you “feel it in your bones”

CAMERON
Mock at your peril Tobias I grew
up around here You didn’t
Cameron blows on the tip of the joint making it glow
CAMERON (CONTD)
Besides Kaye’s been sailing around

checking on people Mostly me

Cameron takes a drag and blows a SMOKE RING before holding
the joint out to Toby

TOBY
(amused)
I can’t imagine why

Cameron grins as Toby takes a conservative puff of the
joint

CUT TO

EXT ROCKY BEACH - NIGHT - LATER
Toby stands on the rocks staring out at the dark water In
the distance Cameron rows his dinghy back toward his own
island
CAMERON (0S)
(singing faint)
“Show me the way to go home”
Toby laughs at his friend singing the “Jaws” song
TOBY
(calls)
Youre tempting fate man

Cameron gives him a salute and keeps rowing into the
distance

As Toby turns to walk back to camp
The LOW RUMBLE of THUNDER stops him in his tracks

Toby looks toward the distant horizon where OMINOUS STORM
CLOUDS ARE GATHERING

TOBY (CONTD)
Ohshit

From the distant darkness

CAMERON (0S)
(faint calling)

What did I tell ya Tobe
(proud)

It’s gonna be a rippah

CUT TO

EXT TOBY’S CAMPSITE - NIGHT

A storm is RAGING WIND and RAIN whip through Toby’s camp as
he huddles under the small plastic tarp

Toby shivers in his sleeping bag soaked and miserable

Lightning FLASHES and Toby SITS UP sensing motion in his
campsite

He peers through the rain but sees no one there
Another FLASH of lightning and Toby sees

-MADELEINE silhouetted in the trees staring at him She
steps into back the shadows and is GONE

Toby jumps to his feet and moves to the treeline He peers
through the wind and rain but there’s no sign of her

Toby sees a BASKET lying in the underbrush Toby carefully
picks up the basket Inside is a YELLOW RAINCOAT wrapped
protectively around his SKETCH BOOK

Toby quickly pulls the raincoat on and looks into the basket
realizing there’s more inside

It’s filled with VEGETABLES Corn tomatoes string beans
a veritable FEAST Toby grins and calls through the wind and
rain into the woods

TOBY
(genuine)
Thank you

Toby slides back under his tarp and hungrily bites into a raw
tomato

He opens the sketch book and thumbs through the various
drawings glad to have it back He then realizes

A PAGE has been TORN OUT Toby stares at the ragged tear
confused She took one of his drawings

Rain water begins to leak through a hole in his tarp and
Toby quickly puts the book away and fixes the leak

Wrapping himself in his damp sleeping bag Toby lies back
shivering as the storm rages around him

CUT TO

EXT ROCKY BEACH - NIGHT

Through the wind and rain the Outward Bound BOAT floats
toward the rocky shore as Kaye struggles to control the
sail

Bumping up against the rocks Kaye quickly drops the sail
jumps over the side and pulls the boat up onto the rocks

Out of breath she shields her eyes from the rain and looks
around

KAYE
(calls out)
Toby

Only the wind answers her

CUT TO

EXT WOODS - NIGHT

Kaye moves through the woods squinting to see in the wet
darkness The rain has stopped for the moment and a thick
MIST has rolled in

She clicks on a large MAG-LITE flashlight and moves further
into the trees

A movement deep in the woods Kaye swings the light’s beam
into the trees

KAYE
Toby

She waits a moment scanning the woods She turns back to the
path

and REACTS seeing Madeleine standing ahead of her but
Madeleine quickly steps into the shadows before Kaye can get
a good look at her

KAYE (CONTD)
Hello

She shines the light into the branches Madeleine shields her
eyes from the bright beam and steps back into the shadows

Kaye turns off the light realizing it’s hurting the girl’s
eyes

KAYE (CONTD)
I’m sorry I didn’t know anyone
else was here You startled me
(beat)
I’m looking for a friend who’s
camping here

Madeleine steps into sight and Kaye is surprised that the
figure she saw is a raw teen beauty in a wet sheer sundress

MADELEINE
Are you looking for Toby
KAYE
That’s right Do you know where he

is
Madeleine points into the woods behind her

KAYE (CONTD)
Will you show me

Madeleine holds out her hand It takes a moment for Kaye to
realize Madeleine is gesturing for the flashlight She holds
out the flashlight to Madeleine who takes it

Madeleine clicks ON the light and shines it in Kayes face

KAYE (CONTD)
(wincing holding up a
hand)
Hey easy there

MADELEINE
(studying her face)
I know you

KAYE
You know me
(Madeleine nods slowly)
How

Without warning Madeleine savagely SMASHES Kaye’s HEAD with
the flashlight and all goes

BLACK

FADE IN

EXT HOLE - NIGHT

Close on Kaye’s unconscious face Blood runs from a deep cut
over her eye

A crumpled piece of paper is STUFFED in her mouth

Kaye’s eyes slowly open She tries to sit up wincing with
pain but then slumps back down into the mud

She pulls the wad of paper from her mouth and looks at it

Its the SKETCH Toby did of HER in the boat The one that was
torn from the book

Kaye looks up realizing that she’s in the bottom of a DEEP
FRESHLY DUG HOLE

Above her Madeleine stands at the edge staring down at her
KAYE
(terrified groggy)

What are you doing

Madeleine dumps a shovelful of DIRT down onto Kaye’s face
Kaye slumps back into the mud choking out dirt

Madeleine dumps another shovelful of dirt onto her and Kaye
realizes with horror

that Madeleine’s going to BURY HER ALIVE

Kaye desperately claws at the dirt wall Her fingers find a
ROOT and she PULLS HERSELF UP onto her feet

-but the muddy wall COLLAPSES ONTO HER throwing her against
the other side and BURYING HER up to her NECK

She’s TRAPPED IMMOBILE and still not up at the surface
Kaye looks up terrified as

KAYE (CONTD)
Please no

Madeleine coldly pours another shovelful of dirt onto her
FACE Kaye spits and wheezes and struggles to free herself
It’s no use She’s pinned The dirt is up to her CHIN

KAYE (CONTD)
(desperate)
Listen to me

Madeleine shovels more onto her so only Kaye’s FACE remains
visible She strains her neck trying to breathe Madeleine
holds another shovelful of dirt over her

KAYE (CONTD)
(wheezing coughing)
Oh God please don’t
The dirt LANDS on Kaye’s face completely covering it except
for a hole where her MOUTH is Dirt falls into Kaye’s mouth
as she tries to BREATHE but it’s choked back out in an
agonized coughing SCREAM

Another shovelful of dirt lands and the scream is
SILENCED

FADE TO

EXT ROCKY BEACH - MORNING
The rain has stopped The sun is up
Toby moves among the rocks draping his clothes and sleeping
bag over them to dry He lies back on a warm rock and looks
out to sea
His eyes NARROW and he sits up concerned
TOBY
(shielding his eyes from
the sun)
What the hell

Drifting well off shore is a CAPSIZED SAILBOAT

Toby runs down to the water’s edge and looks out at it

There are words stenciled on the boat’s hull Toby PALES as
he realizes the words are

OUTWARD BOUND”
TOBY (CONTD)
Oh my god
(cups his hands calls)
Kaye

There’s no answer

Toby dives into the freezing water and swims out toward the
craft When he makes it to the overturned boat he sees that
the sail is tattered - the boat looks like it was torn apart
by the storm

Toby looks back at shore realizing that he’s dangerously far
out

He bangs on the boat’s hull with his palm
TOBY (CONTD)
(loud)
Kaye Are you under there
No response Toby takes a deep breath and SUBMERGES
-- UNDERWATER --

Toby explores the underside of the boat but there’s no sign
of Kaye

He swims back to
-- THE SURFACE --

Toby holds onto the boat wheezing He then looks back at the
island and realizes

TOBY (CONTD)
Shit

the swift CURRENT is carrying him OUT TO SEA

Toby shoves off from the wrecked boat and SWIMS HARD taking
long strides and breathing rapidly

FROM UNDERWATER -- Tobys swimming body moves along the
surface over the rocks far below The current is SWIFT

Toby pushes himself to the limit If he doesn’t reach land by
the time the current carries him past the tip of the
island he’s dead

Toby desperately pumps his arms and legs his breath coming
in gasps

Finally his toes find rocks right as he’s passing the tip
of the island Toby drags himself up onto the rocky shore and
collapses exhausted

He looks back out to sea as the capsized boat drifts away
into the distance

Toby scans the horizon - not another boat in sight He
reaches into his pocket and grabs his KNIFE

He uses the blade to REFLECT SUNLIGHT at Cameron’s distant
island

A moment later he sees a tiny FLASH coming from Camerons
island in response

Toby reflects more light

TOBY (CONTD)
(knowing it’s futile)
Cameron get over here

A few random flashes come back from Cameron’s island

TOBY (CONTD)
(frustrated)
What does that mean Are you
fucking coming

Toby urgently reflects more light

TOBY (CONTD)
(screams in vain)
The boat Cameron The
(stammers explodes)
No one’s coming for us

But Cameron’s island is miles away More nonsensical flashes
of light come back

TOBY (CONTD)
(screams )
I need your goddamn

He trails off and slowly looks over at the distant
LIGHTHOUSE

TOBY (CONTD)
(realizing)
- -phone

Toby pockets the knife and takes off into the woods headed
for the lighthouse

CUT TO

EXT WOODS - DAY

Toby moves swiftly through the dense woods but then slows to
make sure he’s still going the right way

He climbs up a tree to get a better look over the brush and
sees the top of the lighthouse looming a few hundred yards
ahead of him

Toby jumps to the ground and continues on

Toby makes his way down a steep embankment and rounds a shrub
into a

CLEARING
--where he STOPS SHORT

A WOMAN (40s) is kneeling at the other end of the clearing
her back to him Her clothes are homemade Her body is
ROCKING GENTLY

Toby stares at her for a moment unnerved

TOBY
Hello

The woman doesn’t seem to hear him Toby moves closer and
realizes that she’s whispering softly

ALICE
it’s your favorite
(beat)
--it’s your favorite
(beat)
--it’s your favorite

Walking around the woman Toby gets his first look at ALICE
(older than when we last saw her but still strangely
attractive and intense) Alice’s eyes stare blankly ahead

TOBY
Are you all right

Toby suddenly realizes that the woman’s hands and clothes are
SMEARED WITH BLOOD Under her knee is an AX also covered
with blood

ALICE
(whispering)
it’s your favorite
(beat)
-it’s your favorite

Totally disturbed Toby backs away from Alice and turns
around

-right into a horrible skinless FACE

Toby LURCHES back tumbling into a patch of TALL REEDS

The face belongs to a SKINNED DEER CARCASS hanging from a
tree the blood draining onto the ground below

In the background Alice’s low whisper continues
ALICE (CONTD)
it’s your favorite
(beat)
Its
Alice abruptly STOPS speaking and STANDS UP

Toby remains still as Alice picks up the ax and walks over to
the hanging deer carcass

She continues SKINNING it her strong blood-smeared hands
pulling away fur as she slices at it with the ax blade

Toby rises slowly to his feet conflicted about revealing
himself He takes a breath and begins to speak

TOBY
H

A HAND SNAKES around his mouth from behind
Toby JERKS his head around and sees
-Madeleine looking into his eyes

Madeleine slowly SHAKES HER HEAD and puts a finger to her
lips Toby nods confused

Alice turns around but doesn’t see them through the thick
reeds She finishes skinning the deer and then cuts it down
from the tree

Hoisting the deer onto her strong shoulders Alice walks
away disappearing into the woods

In the reeds Toby immediately backs away from Madeleine
staring at her

TOBY (CONTD)
(whispers )
What the hell was that about

Madeleine grabs Toby by the arm and leads him through the
woods casting a nervous look back in the direction Alice
went

MADELEINE
(softly)
I told you not to come here

TOBY
There’s been an accident The boat
that’s supposed to pick me up
capsized in the storm I just need
to use your phone that’s all

Madeleine says nothing and keeps walking ahead

TOBY (CONTD)
Do you have a phone
(off her silence he makes
a “phone” motion)
A telephone To call people

MADELEINE
No

TOBY
What about a radio Anything like
that

(she shakes her head)
How do you talk to people off the
island

MADELEINE
We don’t

Toby stares at her digesting this

TOBY
Ever
(realizing)
Wait a second have you ever been
off this island before

Madeleine says nothing and pushes through branches arriving
at the STREAM

MADELEINE
You know the way to your camp from
here

She starts back into the trees
TOBY
Listen I’m stuck here and no
one’s even expecting us back for
two more weeks

Madeleine looks back at him

MADELEINE
Don’t ever let her see you Toby
Mother doesn’t like trespassers

She steps into the trees

TOBY
I’m not trespassing This isn’t
your island

(beat)

And how the hell do you know my
name

Madeleine pauses and looks back at him The barest hint of
shy smile appears on her lips

MADELEINE
You talk to yourself

Madeleine steps back through the branchesand she’s GONE
Toby is again alone in the woods

CUT TO

EXT ROCKY BEACH - NIGHT
Toby walks along the beach holding the unlit FLARE

He scans the dark horizon looking for the lights of any
passing boat There are NONE

Toby keeps walking his eyes on the horizon

Toby climbs a rock embankment and when he reaches the top
he sees

the LIGHTHOUSE He’s wandered pretty close to it

He instinctively DUCKS DOWN to avoid being seen

Curiosity getting the better of him he sneaks a look up at
the dark looming structure There are small windows in the

tower wall but they’re all DARK

Toby is about to turn back when he notices a tiny BASEMENT
WINDOW at the base of the lighthouse hidden in tall grass

Candlelight flickers from within

Toby looks at it torn between curiosity and Madeleine’s
request to stay away

TOBY
(softly to himself)
They don’t own this island

Toby slowly creeps through the tall grass drawing closer to
the lighthouse

Toby reaches the wall and lowers himself to the ground

He edges closer to the small basement window careful not to
make any noise

Toby peers through the glass which is coated with dust and
dirt

TOBYS POV - Below in a cramped living quarters Madeleine
sits on a small cot repairing her homemade SUNDRESS with a
needle and thread

She examines her stitching and then snips the thread
Madeleine rises and walks to a mirror She looks at her
reflection making sure the thin fabric hangs properly

Toby stares unable to take his eyes off of Madeleine’s body
her skin glistening with perspiration in the heat of the
summer night

Madeleine touches the soft skin of her collarbone tracing
slowly with her fingersdown under the fabric of her dress
to her breast

Madeleine listens carefully for a moment making sure shes
alone

Her hand then slides slowly down past her stomach She closes
her eyes

Outside Toby can’t believe what he’s seeing He moves his
face closer to the glass

Ten feet to his right the DOOR to the tower CREAKS OPEN
Toby FREEZES

Alice steps out of the doorway into the night holding a
flashlight

Toby presses himself into the tall grass and goes still
Alice walks RIGHT PAST HIM the beam of her flashlight coming

within inches of his hiding place She walks to the basement
BULKHEAD and pulls up the doors

Alice then PAUSES as if sensing a presence She scans the
darkness around her as Toby remains motionless in the grass

Alice steps through the basement bulkhead closing the doors
behind her Toby breathes a sigh of relief

He turns his eyes back to the window

TOBYS POV - Below Madeleine still stands at the mirror her
hand moving rhythmically under her dress

TOBY (CONTD)
(under his breath)
Watch it sweetheart you’ve got
company

Madeleines eyes remain closed enjoying the sensation
ALICE (0S)
(muffled through the
glass)
What are you doing

Madeleine turns startled at seeing her mother Her hand
falls to her side

Toby strains to hear the conversation through the glass
MADELEINE
(nervous covering)

I fixed my dress

Alice stares at her and then points to a CHAIR Madeleine
wordlessly sits down

Alice stands before her still holding the flashlight
ALICE
(coldly)
Hand

MADELEINE
Please Mother no

Alice stares at her waiting Madeleine slowly extends her
hand

WHAM Alice SLAMS Madeleines fingers with the FLASHLIGHT
Madeleine cries out in pain

AT THE WINDOW - Toby’s eyes go WIDE with shock

Alice releases Madeleines hand and Madeleine cradles it
Alice kneels in front of her

ALICE
Madeleine look at me

Madeleine slowly meets her eyes

ALICE (CONTD)
(cold firm)
A lady doesnt do that Ever Do
you understand

Madeleine slowly nods Alice gently strokes Madeleines hair
calming

ALICE (CONTD)
Only evil comes from there And we
dont allow evil into our home do
we Madeleine

Madeleine shakes her head Alice sits down behind Madeleines
chair and begins brushing Madeleines hair almost like she
would a dolls

ALICE (CONTD)
Your hairs getting so long
(beat)
Would you like me to cut it
Beat

MADELEINE
I like it the way it is

Alice leans forward and looks into her daughters eyes
ALICE
Well I dont and Im the one who
has to look at you
OUTSIDE - Toby watches disturbed

Alice walks to a closet and opens it She digs in a box and
finds a pair of scissors

As she steps away from the closet Toby notices an old JACKET
crumpled on the floor way in the back behind assorted
boxes

He squints realizing that there’s yellow lettering on the
jacket

“Maine State Police”

TOBY
(softly)
What the hell
He looks closer at the NAME stenciled on the lapel
“CLOSTERMAN”
Toby’s eyes go WIDE remembering the story of
TOBY (CONTD)
(whispers )

Lucy Closterman

Toby looks over at Madeleine who sits silently in the chair
her sad eyes fixed on the floor

TOBY (CONTD)
(stunned)
Baby Lucy
Its Madeleine That means her mother is
Suddenly Alice passes RIGHT IN FRONT of the window
startling Toby He flinches knocking over a small stack of
firewood
Alice glances toward the window
Toby scrambles to his feet and SPRINTS to the trees jumping
into the brush He looks back at the small basement window
and sees Alice peering into the night
Alice frowns and moves away from the window
Toby waits a few seconds and then carefully edges away to the
cliff’s edge He looks down the length of the island which

seems smaller and more isolated than ever before

The island where hes trapped with a notorious multiple
murderer

He gets up and quietly heads into the woods toward his camp

CUT TO

EXT ROCKY BEACH - NIGHT

Toby sits down on the embankment holding his FLARE He scans
the horizon for the lights of a boat but there’s nothing but
night sky as far as the eye can see

Toby shivers with the cold tapping the flare in his hand
It’s going to be a long lonely night

FADE TO

EXT ROCKY BEACH - MORNING

The first light of dawn shines through the trees Toby lies
asleep on the embankment the flare still in his hand He
shudders in his sleep pulling his shirt tight around him in
the crisp morning air

A persons SHADOW moves slowly across him The person then
presses a SHOTGUN to Tobys cheek Toby’s eyes FLY OPEN
Terrified he tries to move but a heavy BOOT steps onto his
chest

Toby looks up and sees LEARY (44 large bearded man) standing
over him aiming the shotgun into his face

LEARY
(cold)
Mornin’
(nods toward the discarded
LOBSTER BUOY)
You done fucked up boy

TOBY
(shielding himself)
Jesus Christ

LEARY
How many were in the trap

TOBY
(frightened)
Two
(off Leary’s look)
I swear to God

LEARY
Then you owe me for two Right now

TOBY
I don’t have money with me but
I’ll give you anything you want if
youll take me back with you
(points)

Listen to me There’s a woman
living in that lighthouse She’s
got a teenage daughter with her

Leary SLAMS the butt of the shotgun into Toby’s stomach

LEARY

You lost me after “I don’t have
money”

(Toby clutches his

stomach in pain)
Let me make this very clear you
steal from me again and you’re a
drowned corpse that I get a reward
for finding Got it

(off Toby’s silence he

KICKS him)
Nod you fuck

Toby nods still trying to catch his breath Leary grabs the
lobster trap and walks toward his boat anchored just off
shore Toby struggles to his feet

TOBY
(wheezing)
You can’t leave me here

Leary throws the lobster trap into the boat and climbs in as
Toby limps into the water after him

TOBY (CONTD)
Please

Leary cocks the shotgun and aims it at Toby who stops short

LEARY
Step away from my boat boy

TOBY
You have to help me

LEARY
(re the gun)
This here says I don’t

TOBY
(carefully remembering
what Cameron said)
How do I know those are live shells
in there

LEARY
Blanks cost more

Toby studies Leary’s grim face He’s not fucking around
TOBY

Will you at least tell the police
I’m stuck here

Leary turns on the LOUD ENGINE and looks back at Toby

LEARY
(smug)
Sorry I didn’t catch that

Leary pulls up the anchor and the boat begins to drift away
from shore

TOBY
(yells over the engine)
This woman is a wanted murderer
Alice Malkin Will you at least
tell them that

Leary gives a dismissive laugh and walks to the steering
wheel

TOBY (CONT’D)
(yells over the noise)
What the hell is wrong with you

Leary engages the throttle and the lobster boat rumbles away
from shore Toby notes the boat’s NAME written on the stern

“Salt Peter” Booth Bay Maine

CUT TO

EXT TOBY’S CAMPSITE - DAY

Toby walks back into his camp furious He grabs his sketch
book and turns to a blank page

He quickly sketches Leary’s FACE from memory and then notes
“Salt Peter Booth Bay”

TOBY
(to the sketch)
I am going to find you and I am
going to fuck you

He slams the book shut and turns around
TOBY (CONTD)
(alarmed)
Jesus

Madeleine stands behind him staring at him coldly

MADELEINE
You came to my home last night

Toby can see by her expression that there’s no point lying

TOBY
(calming himself)
I’m sorry I shouldn’t have

MADELEINE
I told you not to come And you
did Why

TOBY
Look I’ve just never known anyone
who lives the way you do I got
curious

MADELEINE
(serious)
She can’t see you Toby

TOBY
Trust me she won’t I’m never
going back there
(Madeleine isn’t
convinced)
I promise

Madeleine studies him for a moment weighing his answer and
finally nods She walks past Toby and kneels by the fire
examining the improvised cooking pot

MADELEINE
Clever

Toby joins her at the fire relieved to change the subject

MADELEINE (CONT’D)
But you needed to boil the mussels
longer

TOBY
Ill make sure to remember that the
next time I never ever eat a
mussel again as long as I live

He takes a sip of water and studies Madeleine
TOBY (CONT’D)
So you’ve really never left this

island Not even once

MADELEINE
This is my home Why would I leave

TOBY
Because that’s what people our age
do They leave home

MADELEINE
Mother says no one must know we’re
here

TOBY
(carefully)
Has she ever told you why

MADELEINE
Because this is the only happy
place in the world Toby
(smiles)
And it’s ours

Toby stares at her disturbed

TOBY
She told you that
(Madeleine nods)
Do you believe her

Madeleine’s eyes move to the sketch book in Toby’s arms She
holds out her hand and Toby hands her the book

MADELEINE
(flips through the pages
slowly)
Your drawings Are they real

places
Toby nods and points to a particular sketch

TOBY
That’s Rockefeller Center in New
York I went there with my dad when
I was kid

Madeleine’s eyes take in the image of the New York skyline

She flips a few pages more arriving at the page that was
TORN OUT Madeleine looks at Toby uncomfortable

TOBY (CONTD)
(smiles forgiving)
It’s okay You can keep that one if
you liked it

MADELEINE
(cold)
I didn’t like it It was ugly

Toby stares at her surprised Madeleine hands the book back
to Toby

MADELEINE (CONT’D)
The others are beautiful

Toby takes the book from her unnerved Madeleine pulls a
BRANCH from a tree and begins to WHITTLE the end of it with
her HUNTING KNIFE

TOBY
Listen I need to find a way to get
home Do you have a boat
(Madeleine shakes her
head)
Then I need to signal someone to
come get me Will you help me do

that

MADELEINE
No

TOBY
Why not

Madeleine looks up from her work

MADELEINE
(smiles)
Because I don’t want you to leave

Toby studies her for a moment concerned with this new
development Madeleine examines the branch which she’s
whittled into a SPEAR She rises and walks toward the woods

TOBY
Where are you going

MADELEINE
You haven’t eaten I’m going to
feed you
Toby looks after her as she disappears into the trees
TOBY
(softly)

To what

He follows after her

FADE TO

EXT PENOBSCOT BAY - DAY

Leary’s lobster boat moves along the shore of the island

Leary opens a beer and cuts the engine Taking a sip he
studies the lighthouse high on the bluff

After a moment Leary turns on the engine and throttles the
boat toward the lighthouse

CUT TO

EXT WOODS - DAY
Toby follows Madeleine through the woods concerned

TOBY
I can’t stay here Madeleine You
know that right

MADELEINE
You don’t like me

TOBY
Of course I like you But I have a
home a life

MADELEINE
I showed myself to you Toby

TOBY
(confused)
And I’m glad you did

Madeleine stops and looks at him

MADELEINE
Nobody is allowed to see me

TOBY
You mentioned that before but what
does that mean

MADELEINE
It means that if mother knew you
were here
(beat)
It would be bad

She walks on ahead Toby looks at her concerned

EXT LIGHTHOUSE - DAY

Leary carrying his shotgun climbs the rocky bluff until he
reaches the lighthouse

He looks up at the crumbling structure and glances around the
area He’s all alone

Leary walks around the circular wall until he arrives at the
basement bulkhead He slowly opens the bulkhead doors and
stares down into the darkness

CUT TO

INT LIGHTHOUSE - BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS
Leary steps down into the dimly-lit basement living quarters

He looks around cautiously and moves into the center of the
room failing to notice

Alice sitting in a chair in the shadows WATCHING HIM
with a needle and thread in her lap

Leary sees a TEA KETTLE simmering on the stove steam rising
from it

Someone must be here

Leary slowly turns around and sees Alice She meets his gaze
unflinching

ALICE
Well

Leary slides his hand into his jacket pocket and pulls
out

a container of SALT He places it on the table He reaches
into his other pockets and pulls out more items

COOKING OIL BATTERIES LIGHTER FLUID ASPIRIN Alice watches
him impassive

LEARY
That’s everything

Alice puts down her sewing work and rises to her feet
keeping her eyes on Leary

She slowly begins to UNBUTTON her shirt

LEARY (CONTD)
Don’t bother

Alice’s hands stop

LEARY (CONTD)
(smug)
A little birdie told me the
strangest thing this morning
(beat)
Word is you’ve got a daughter here
with you Guess you must’a failed
to mention her before

Alice’s eyes grow COLD Leary notices a small BABY PILLOW
with the name “Madeleine” embroidered on it His mouth curves
into an evil grin as he looks back at Alice

LEARY (CONT’D)

I don’t know who you are
sweetheart or what kind of trouble
youve been hiding from out here
all these years And I’ve never
much cared But if you want to stay
hidden

(smiles cruelly)
-then I think this little
arrangement oughtta be between me
and her from now on

Alice GLARES AT HIM but Leary only smirks back

Alice steps closer to him and Leary can’t help but notice
the curve of her breasts Alice moves her body close to his

ALICE
And who was this “little bird” who
told you these things

LEARY
Some kid stranded on your island
You ask me I think he likes her

Alice’s eyes grow even colder Leary slowly buttons up
Alice’s shirt grinning cruelly

LEARY (CONT’D)
So why don’t you make yourself
useful and give your girl a whistle
so I can get to know her better

Alice slowly strokes Leary’s FACE with her hand

ALICE
(whispers softly)
You will never touch her

The SEWING NEEDLE glints between her fingers but Leary sees
it too late Alice SLIDES THE NEEDLE into his EYEBALL

Leary ROARS with pain and reels back SMASHING through the
table and scattering pots and pans

LEARY
(in agony)
You goddamn whore

Lying on the floor Leary reaches for his SHOTGUN but Alice
grabs a broken TABLE LEG and SWINGS IT grotesquely BREAKING
HIS ARM

Leary screams in pain and the gun skids out of reach Alice
places her FOOT on his THROAT choking him

ALICE
(calmly)
Where’s the boy

LEARY
(choking)
Fuck you

Alice grabs the TEA KETTLE and POURS BOILING WATER onto
Leary’s face He SCREAMS in agony

ALICE
(softly repeats)
Where’s the boy
Leary’s eyes bulge as he chokes
LEARY
(chokes glaring)
Fucking your daughter’s ass you
cunt

Alice’s eyes FLARE She STAMPS on Leary’s THROAT CRUSHING
his windpipe with a sickening CRUNCH

Alice then SMASHES his face with the red-hot KETTLE
Then she hits him AGAIN

And AGAIN

Blood sprays up onto Alice’s face and clothes until she
slowly rises and places the kettle back on the stove
breathing hard

Leary lies DEAD in the rubble of the table his face MANGLED

Alice walks to the window and looks out over the island in
the direction of Toby’s camp her eyes cold

CUT TO

EXT HILLTOP - DAY

Madeleine climbs up a steep incline as Toby does his best to
follow

TOBY
If it’s so terrible for your mother
to find me here then I need to
signal a boat and get out of here

MADELEINE
There are no boats

She climbs onto the top of the ridge and reaches down for
Toby

TOBY
(hauling himself up)
I came on a boat Trust me they’re
out there

MADELEINE
No Toby They’re not

She gestures around them and Toby takes in the INCREDIBLE
VIEW from the hilltop From there they can see for miles in
every direction There’s glimmering ocean as far as the eye
can see

--but not one boat Toby scans the ocean in disbelief Toby
then squints into the distance toward a tiny sliver of
green

TOBY
(points)
Wait a second is that the
mainland
(squints to see better)
Holy shit it is

He smiles and looks at Madeleine

TOBY (CONTD)
If I build a big enough fire

MADELEINE
No

Toby is taken aback by her tone

MADELEINE (CONT’D)
There have been fires before No
one comes

Toby looks off into the distance His eye lands on

TOBY
What about the lighthouse
(turns to Madeleine)
Is any of the old equipment still
in there The lenses the
kerosene

MADELEINE
Toby stop

TOBY

I need a signal that can be seen
all the way from the mainland and
you live in one

(excited)
I mean shit if a lighthouse
that’s been dead for a hundred
years suddenly turns on people
will come trust me

MADELEINE
(furious screams)
Stop it

Toby goes silent surprised by her violent outburst
Madeleine stares at him coldly the spear in her hand

MADELEINE (CONTD)
Stop talking about leaving

Toby is speechless

MADELEINE (CONTD)
Youre alive because of me If you
build a fire she’ll know If you
go to the lighthouse she’ll know

TOBY
Madeleine what exactly would
happen to me if your mother knew I
was here
(Madeleine is silent)
Has she killed people who have seen
you

Madeleine slowly nods

MADELEINE
When I was young

TOBY
And now

Madeleine looks into his eyes

MADELEINE
Now she has me do it

Toby stares at her stunned He steps backwards from her
instinctively

TOBY
What

Madeleine takes a step toward him the breeze blowing through
her sundress and hair

MADELEINE
(smiles reassuring)
She doesn’t know you’re here Toby
It’s all right

TOBY
No it’s not fucking all right
(in shock)

Youre as crazy as she is
Madeleine reaches out to touch his face

TOBY (CONTD)
Don’t touch me

Toby grabs the HUNTING KNIFE from Madeleine’s dress and holds
it out Madeleine looks at him amused as if this is some
kind of game

MADELEINE
What are you doing Toby

TOBY
You stay the hell away from me I
don’t want to see you anywhere near
my camp

Her eyes locked on Toby Madeleine steps forward until the
knife blade is resting on her chest just below her throat

MADELEINE
You don’t mean that

Toby can’t believe it - this is turning her on Madeleine
slides her fingers around the BLADE

MADELEINE (CONT’D)
We’re going to be as happy as two
people have ever been Toby

She slides the razor-sharp tip gently down the skin of her
perspiring chest toward her breasts

MADELEINE (CONT’D)
But until then

She slides her hand onto Toby’s hand

MADELEINE (CONT’D)
-you need to learn some manners

--and BREAKS HIS INDEX FINGER with a grotesque SNAP Toby
cries out in pain In one fluid motion Madeleine grabs
Toby’s NECK and slams him onto his back

Madeleine straddles Toby placing the knife on his THROAT
She leans close to him whispering into his ear

MADELEINE (CONT’D)
Do you understand

Toby stares up at her in terror and disbelief

FADE TO

EXT FLAT ROCK - DAY

Toby sits on a large rock in the water making a rudimentary
SPLINT for his finger out of a small stick and a piece of his
shirt Madeleine’s SUNDRESS lies discarded next to him

He winces as he ties the splint in place then moves to the
edge of the rock and looks down into the water where

Madeleine swims naked along the ocean floor far below
SPEAR in hand her body moving smoothly between beds of kelp

Toby stares down at her for a moment his expression a mix of
anger and reluctant arousal

Toby paces nervously and scans the horizon - there are still
no boats anywhere to be seen He lies back on the rock deep
in thought

A ripple near him He looks over but there’s no sign of
Madeleine Suspecting that she’s toying with him he closes
his eyes again

TOBY
You know I’d ask you for a new
fucking finger if I didn’t think
you actually had one lying around

No answer Toby rolls his head to the side and opens his
eyes seeing

a large KING CRAB inches from his face claws snapping

TOBY (CONT’D)
Jesus

Toby sits up quickly as Madeleine’s smiling face appears at
the edge of the rock

TOBY (CONT’D)
Funny

Madeleine places the large crab into the water behind her and
holds up the SPEAR proudly She’s caught a SALMON

Propping her elbows on the rock Madeleine grabs her knife
and expertly cuts a large piece of meat handing it to Toby
who eats it Off Madeleine’s seeming surprise

TOBY (CONTD)
What

MADELEINE
I thought you might resist
(off his look)
You let the rabbit go

TOBY
Rabbits aren’t made of sashimi

Madeleine eats a piece herself She rinses her hands and
looks up at Toby

MADELEINE
Look away

Toby averts his eyes as Madeleine slides her naked body out
of the water onto the rock and slips on her sundress

She lies back letting the sun warm her tanned skin Toby
watches her

TOBY
You know that your mother had no
right to raise you here like this
don’t you Just you two all alone

Madeleine looks at him a bit offended
MADELEINE
I love it here Toby And my mother
would kill and die for me Would
yours

Toby thinks for a moment and then shakes his head

TOBY
No

MADELEINE
Then I feel sorry for you

Madeleine rolls onto her stomach Toby can’t help looking
down her long tanned legs

TOBY
But my father would have

Beat

MADELEINE
I don’t have a father

TOBY
We all do Madeleine Even you

Madeleine looks at him cooly

MADELEINE
I know I have a father Toby Every
animal does
(beat)
Mine is dead

Toby nods slowly and eats his last bite of fish

TOBY
So you’re saying you’re an animal

Madeleine’s piercing eyes look at him as she ties her wet
hair into a loose knot

MADELEINE
We’re all animals Toby

Madeleine closes her eyes and stretches her slender body
along the warm rock Toby stares out to sea for a moment

TOBY

I heard a story once

(carefully)
A woman killed her husband and
daughter Then she murdered two
innocent people and stole their
baby girl

(beat)
Your mother ever tell you that
story

MADELEINE
(eyes still closed)
Why would she tell me a story like
that

Toby frowns

TOBY
I guess she wouldn’t
(Madeleine says nothing)
Your mother’s name isn’t Alice is
it

MADELEINE
(looks at him firmly)
I don’t want to talk about Mother
anymore Toby

TOBY
Hey if you don’t like questions
you shouldn’t have shown yourself
to me I didn’t ask for this

MADELEINE
You were about to eat poison

TOBY
Maybe you should have let me

Madeleine seems offended by the comment

MADELEINE
I’m not a bad person Toby

TOBY
(gives her a look)
With all due respect your
definition of “bad person” is
debatable

Toby looks out to sea
MADELEINE
If you want to know why I showed
myself to you it’s because I liked
watching you
(leans toward him)
It felt good

Toby looks back at her very conscious of how close her body
is to his

MADELEINE (CONT’D)
And I wondered things about you

TOBY
What did you “wonder” about me

Madeleine’s fingers gently touch his stomach and slide along
his skin

MADELEINE
What your skin would feel like

Toby watches her hand reluctantly enjoying the sensation

TOBY
What does it feel like

MADELEINE
Warm

To Toby’s surprise her fingers begin sliding under his
waistband He places his hand on hers stopping it

Madeleine looks into his eyes hungrily

MADELEINE (CONT’D)
Let me see

Toby slowly moves her hand away from his waistband

TOBY
No

Madeleine’s eyes narrow

MADELEINE
Why

Toby thinks for a moment then rises to his feet and looks
down at her

TOBY
Do you know what a Siren is
Madeleine

Madeleine shakes her head

TOBY (CONTD)
It’s you
(beat)
And things always end badly for the
guys who give in to them

He DIVES into the freezing water to help him resist
temptation and swims out a ways

Once he’s thirty feet out he looks back at Madeleine lying
on the rock watching him looking incredibly sexy in her
damp sheer sundress

TOBY (CONTD)
(to himself)
Don’t even think about it
(softly)
Crazy fucking is not worth fucking
crazy

He splashes cold water on his face and floats on his back
staring up at the sky to avoid looking back at Madeleine

As his body slowly revolves he notices

--BLACK SMOKE rising in a column over the treetops in the
distance

TOBY (CONTD)
What the hell

He looks over at Madeleine who is also staring at the smoke
concerned She glances out at Toby

MADELEINE
Go to your camp Don’t move from
there

Madeleine then nimbly SPRINTS across the dangerous rocks and
VANISHES into the woods

Toby eyes the smoke hopeful

TOBY
Fuck that

CUT TO

EXT WOODS - AFTERNOON

Toby sneaks through the trees until he sees the edge of an
embankment ahead Beyond it thick black smoke billows from
below

Toby gets down on his hands and knees and crawls carefully to
the edge and looks over Thirty feet down

LEARYS LOBSTER BOAT is adrift just off shore ENGULFED IN
FLAMES Leary is a CHARRED CORPSE at the wheel

Alice stands on the shore holding Learys SHOTGUN and
watching the boat burn

TOBY
(softly horrified)
Jesus Christ

Madeleine stands near Alice obediently gathering salvaged
items into a box - Leary’s raincoat shotgun shells rope
soda etc

Toby watches as Alice’s gaze moves from the burning boat to
her daughter

ALICE
Where have you been all day
Madeleine

Beat

MADELEINE
The garden

Alice looks into her daughter’s eyes studying her carefully

Without warning she SLAPS MADELEINE hard across the face
Madeleine crumples to her knees and looks up at Alice

ALICE
I know when you’re lying to me
(Madeleine says nothing)
I know before the words even leave
your filthy little mouth
(glares down at her)
(MORE )

ALICE (CONTD)
I’m going to ask you a question
and I want the truth

Madeleine lowers her eyes to the ground

ALICE (CONTD)
Are you intact

Madeleine looks up confused Alice stares right into her
eyes

ALICE (CONTD)
Are you whole

Hidden on the cliff above them Toby goes PALE

TOBY
(softly realizing)
Oh shit

Back down at the water’s edge Madeleine meets her mother’s
eyes terrified

MADELEINE
I don’t know what you mean

Alice SLAPS Madeleine again and Madeleine’s eyes tear up

ALICE
(cold)
The boy Madeleine Did you let him
touch you

MADELEINE
(crying)
Please don’t hit me

Alice grabs her CHIN her nails digging into Madeleine’s
skin She glares into Madeleines eyes

ALICE
(cold)
I gave up my life to save you from
ruin

MADELEINE
(screams )
I’m not ruined

Alice HITS Madeleine again as Madeleine cowers

ALICE
Tell he where he is
(Madeleine is silent)
(MORE)

ALICE (CONTD)
Tell me now Madeleine or so help
me God

Madeleine silently points in the direction of Toby’s
campsite Alice GLARES at Madeleine her suspicion now
confirmed

MADELEINE
(crying)
I’m sorry Mother I’m sorry

Alice picks the shotgun off the ground

ALICE
(disgusted)
Get up
MADELEINE

What are you going to do to him

ALICE
Im not going to do anything
(turns to her)
A sin is the responsibility of the
sinner Madeleine

Alice slides Madeleine’s hunting knife from her dress and
examines the blade

ALICE (CONTD)
It’s time to atone

She holds out the knife to Madeleine Madeleine slowly nods
ashamed and takes the knife The two women walk away down
the shore toward Toby’s camp

At the top of the cliff Toby stares after them

He crawls back from the cliff’s edge and gets to his feet
his mind racing

TOBY
Fuck fuckFUCK

He stares down at Leary’s burning boat which begins to SINK
taking Leary’s charred corpse with it Seawater SIZZLES as
the boat slips beneath the surface

Toby’s eye then lands on something he didn’t see before
Lying on the rocks near Leary’s salvaged gear are several

empty OLD-FASHIONED lead containers marked “KEROSENE” which
Alice used to torch the boat

Toby stares at the ancient lead containers realizing where
they must have come from

He turns and looks at
the LIGHTHOUSE

CUT TO

EXT LIGHTHOUSE - AFTERNOON

Toby moves along the edge of the cliff drawing closer to the
massive decrepit lighthouse

He stays low keeping an eye on Madeleine and Alice in the
distance as they make their way toward his camp

Toby then runs to the lighthouse but finds that the TOWER
DOOR is LOCKED Toby throws his SHOULDER into it and the
old rusted lock BREAKS OFF

The door swings open and Toby slips inside

INT LIGHTHOUSE - STAIRWELL - AFTERNOON

Toby enters a large round CHAMBER with a rickety rusted
SPIRAL STAIRWAY leading all the way to the top of the
lighthouse

TWO HEAVY CHAINS hang through a hole in the ceiling
supporting LEAD COUNTERWEIGHTS that dangle inches from the
stone floor at Toby’s feet

He begins to climb up the decrepit staircase which GROANS
under his weight

CRACK One of the support bolts at the top BREAKS and the
stairway LEANS precariously hanging from only ONE RUSTED
BOLT

Toby grips the railing and looks up - it’s a long way to the
top

Toby carefully climbs higher and higher trying not to step
too heavily

He finally reaches the top and steps onto a ledge relieved
to be on solid footing

Ahead of him is a DOOR

CUT TO

INT LIGHTHOUSE - LANTERN ROOM - AFTERNOON

Toby passes through the door entering the LANTERN ROOM the
OPEN-AIR CHAMBER at the very top of the lighthouse

The LIGHT APPARATUS looks right out of Jules Verne - two
large glass LENSES envelop a rope WICK all set atop a
ROTATOR MECHANISM rusted with age

Getting to work Toby examines a large wooden WINCH where

the CHAIN is spooled The chain leads through a HOLE in the
floor and Toby peers through - the chain goes all the way

down to the COUNTERWEIGHTS in the chamber below

TOBY
(getting it)
Okay

Toby grabs the winch handle and strains to TURN IT wincing
with the pain it causes his broken finger The chain pulls up
a few inches and Toby then lets go of the handle

After some creaking the counterweight slowly begins to
rotate the LIGHT APPARATUS It turns for a few seconds and
slows to a stop as the counterweights reach the bottom again

TOBY (CONTD)
(amazed at the simplicity)
It’s a grandfather clock

Next Toby kneels at the light apparatus and examines it
Reaching in he feels the rope WICK and follows it down to
its base There’s a small HATCH where the kerosene goes He
opens the lid and SNIFFS the opening confirming his theory

Toby walks around the room looking for kerosene Seeing a
TRAP DOOR he pulls it up finding a musty dark storage area
below Pushing aside spiderwebs Toby sees heavy coils of
CHAIN stored inside along with extra wicks and CANS OF
KEROSENE

Toby grabs a can and leans down into the hold again grabbing
a battered old-fashioned TIN BOX marked “MATCHES” He shakes
it and smiles at the rattle of matches inside

Toby looks at the light taking stock of his situation

TOBY (CONTD)
What haven’t you thought of

Toby’s eyes land on the DOOR and he grabs heavy coils of
chains and BARRICADES IT to keep Madeleine and Alice OUT

Toby then moves to the winch and begins WINDING UP the fifty
feet of chain below his face flush with adrenaline

CUT TO

EXT WOODS - DUSK

Alice cradles the shotgun as she walks through the trees
followed by Madeleine

ALICE
Did he try to touch you

MADELEINE
(lies)
He tried I didn’t let him

Alice stares at Madeleine weighing her honesty

ALICE
But you wanted to

Madeleine says nothing

ALICE (CONTD)
(cold)
Youre a stupid filthy little
girl Madeleine And you have no
idea what men do

Madeleine stares ahead as she walks

MADELEINE
He asked me if your name is Alice

Alice slows to a stop disturbed Madeleine notes her
mother’s sudden change in expression

MADELEINE (CONT’D)
Is it

Alice slowly reaches for Madeleine’s face taking it gently
into her hands

ALICE
My name is “Mother” Madeleine

Madeleine nods and tries to turn away but Alice holds her
HEAD firmly keeping her eyes locked on Madeleine’s

ALICE (CONTD)
--and I am the only person who
loves you or will ever love you
(beat)
You know that right

Madeleine’s eyes narrow bitter and hurt but she nods

ALICE (CONTD)
(looks past Madeleine)
How much further

Madeleine points toward a clearing just ahead Alice gently
strokes her daughter’s hair

ALICE (CONTD)
(softly)
He’s going to beg Don’t hear him
(beat)
He’s going to make promises Don’t
believe them
(beat)
Act quickly Feel nothing

Madeleine nods obediently and walks ahead slowly pushing
through branches until she reaches the clearing There she
finds

-a YOUNG MAN crouched by the fire his back to her

Sensing her presence the Young Man turns around a JOINT
hanging from his lips It’s CAMERON and the joint falls from
his mouth as he sees the sexy young woman staring at him

CAMERON
(smiles)
Were certainly not Toby are we

Madeleine stares at him for a moment weighing this turn of
events She glances behind her then meets his eyes again

MADELEINE
(coldly)
You are

Cameron raises a confused eyebrow and we

CUT TO

INT LIGHTHOUSE - LANTERN ROOM - DUSK

The LENSES slowly TURN now that Toby’s wound the
counterweights below but the light itself is still not lit

Toby unscrews the cap of the kerosene reservoir and pours
kerosene into the hole

Toby stands up and looks around making sure he’s thought of
everything

TOBY
All right
(re the huge revolving
light apparatus)
Let’s fire you up

Toby grabs the ancient battered tin of MATCHES and strains
to pry the lid open

It GIVES suddenly covering Toby not with matches but
DEAD TERMITES

TOBY (CONTD)
(repulsed)
Jesus

Toby sifts through the scattered carcasses realizing

TOBY (CONTD)
Oh god no

The termites must have EATEN the matches decades ago

Toby jumps to his feet and looks over the railing Far below
the bulkhead DOOR is PADLOCKED dashing his hopes of finding
more matches

TOBY (CONTD)
(slams his hands on the
railing)
No

Toby looks into the storage hold again desperate for any
source of flame but finds NOTHING

Getting an idea he digs in his pocket and pulls out his
SWISS ARMY KNIFE

Extending the MAGNIFYING GLASS he glances out toward the
horizon where the red SUN is dangerously close to SETTING

TOBY (CONTD)
Shit

He uses the magnifying glass to focus a BEAM of light on the
WICK trying to get a flame going Toby sweats as he
concentrates

A small WISP OF SMOKE appears

TOBY (CONT’D)
Yes

The wick continues to SMOKE but resists catching fire

TOBY (CONTD)
Damn it light

The sun’s now AT THE HORIZON and sinking fast
TOBY (CONTD)
(desperate)

Come on

The sun DIPS beneath the horizon The focused beam DIES and
the smoke fades away

TOBY (CONTD)
Motherfucker

Toby looks out at the sunset in disbelief He grabs his head
frustrated

TOBY (CONTD)
You idiot

Toby stares out across the island his mind racing
TOBY (CONTD)
(remembers )
The flare
He quickly looks in the direction of his campsite
and something he sees makes him go PALE
In the distance on the rocky beach is Camerons rowboat
TOBY (CONTD)
(horrified)
Oh my god
He grips the railing conflicted about what to do

TOBY (CONTD)
Nono nofuck

No choice - he cups his hands to his mouth

TOBY (CONTD)
(SCREAMS )
Cameron Get away from there
(screams )
Cameron

But he’s much too far away to be heard Only the sound of
crows answers him

Toby spins and runs to the door yanking away the heavy
chains he’s piled against it

CUT TO

INT LIGHTHOUSE - STAIRWELL - DUSK

Toby races down the rickety spiral staircase which SWAYS
with his weight until

CRACK The other support bolt BREAKS FREE of the wall The
metal staircase FALLS SEVERAL FEET before JARRING to a STOP
against the wall listing dangerously

Toby FREEZES gripping the rail balancing precariously fifty
feet over the stone floor

With a horrible WRENCHING noise the stairway begins to
SCRAPE FREE of the wall IT’S GOING TO FALL

Toby lunges back UP the stairs grabbing the cement PLATFORM
as

the staircase PLUMMETS out from under him CRASHING to
the stone floor far below in a massive tangle of twisted
metal

Toby’s legs flail as he dangles over the drop Finally he
pulls himself up to the landing

Breathing hard Toby looks far down to the bottom where the
wreckage of the staircase is now hopelessly blocking the
DOOR

He’s trapped in the lighthouse

CUT TO

INT LIGHTHOUSE - LANTERN ROOM - DUSK

Toby runs back into the lantern room and looks out across the
island

Cameron’s rowboat is still there but there’s no sign of
Cameron

Toby sees the COILS OF CHAINS and gets an idea He grabs the
end of one of the chains and wraps it around the RAILING

He HEAVES the HEAVY COIL over the side which unravels as it
plummets to the ground far below

Toby grabs the chain and swings his legs over the railing

Looking down at the dizzying drop below him he takes a deep
breath

CUT TO

EXT LIGHTHOUSE - DUSK

and SLIDES his body fully over gripping the chain as best
he can with the makeshift bandage on his injured hand Toby’s
feet scramble for a foothold but find none

Trying not to look down Toby lowers himself down the chain
His hands SLIP and he DROPS a few feet before getting a good
grip again

Toby climbs down the rest of the way and jumps to the ground
Barely taking a moment to catch his breath he SPRINTS into
the woods headed toward his campsite and Cameron

CUT TO

EXT TOBY’S CAMPSITE - DUSK

Cameron stands in front of Madeleine overly conscious of her
sexy body barely covered by the ill-fitting thin sundress
She steps toward him aware that her mother is watching
hidden

MADELEINE
I shouldn’t have let you see me
Toby It was a mistake

Cameron studies her confused and then smiles

CAMERON
Oh I get it Youre
(thinks shakes his head)
Wait no I don’t get it What are
you talking about

MADELEINE
(softly)
It’s time for you to be quiet

She slowly kneels in front of him and looks up into his eyes

MADELEINE (CONTD)
(whispers )
Toby is your friend

Cameron leans toward her not sure why she’s whispering but
playing along anyway

CAMERON
(whispers )
Yes he is so I trust you haven’t
shrunk his head or eaten him That
would upset me greatly

Madeleine simply stares at him as Cameron gets a brief
tantalizing glimpse down the front of her dress

MADELEINE
(whispers )
I want you to understand
(beat)
Toby is with me now He’s mine

Cameron laughs for a moment but then looks into her intense
eyes She’s not kidding - she’s dead serious

CAMERON
Holy shit
(realizing)
»youre fucking nuts

Madeleine REACHES for Cameron who flinches back wary To
his surprise Madeleine STROKES his face and looks into his
eyes

MADELEINE
(whispers )
Youre doing a beautiful thing for
Toby
(genuine)
Thank you

Her fingers move gently along Cameron’s face as her other
hand slides up his back holding her KNIFE

CAMERON
(reluctantly enjoying the
sensation)
What beautiful thing would that be

Madeleine smiles at Cameron sympathetically

---and then deftly SLICES the BACK of Camerons NECK with the
knife severing his spinal cord instantly

Cameron SLUMPS TO THE GROUND his head THUMPING hard onto the
dirt as blood begins to pool around him

CLOSE ON Camerons terrified PARALYZED FACE

His eyes are still open and little BREATHS puff from his
mouth

He tries to speak but no words come out only a faint choking
sound

MADELEINE
(strokes his head
comforting)
Shhh
Madeleine gently uses her thumb to close Camerons right
eyelid but his LEFT eye keeps staring up at her wide with
terror

She then gently closes his left eyelid as well and hes
helpless to resist totally paralyzed

Camerons pained breathing continues for another few
seconds

--and then STOPS with one long exhale Cameron is dead

CUT TO

EXT WOODS - EVENING

Toby SPRINTS through the trees jumping over logs and
crashing through underbrush

He slows to a stop and looks around making sure he’s going
the right way

Movement up ahead catches his eye

Toby quickly HIDES sliding his body into a small GULLY He
presses himself to the ground waiting

Alice walks into view on the path above him cradling the
SHOTGUN Toby remains motionless as she passes by - her feet
passing within inches of him

When she’s past Toby edges further backwards heading toward
the rocky beach now visible through the brush

He crawls on his elbows to the edge of the shrubs and
carefully looks across the rocky beach

He squints seeing

Madeleine standing waist-deep in the water guiding
Camerons ROWBOAT away from shore

Toby sees his own camping gear and BAG lying in the rowboat
He then PALES seeing something else
TOBY
(distraught)
Oh god no
Camerons LIMP FEET protrude from inside the boat

Toby squeezes his eyes shut devastated - he’s too late

Eyes burning with anger Toby watches as Madeleine lifts a
LARGE ROCK out of the water

She HEAVES it into the boat smashing a hole through the
hull The boat immediately begins taking on water

As the boat slowly sinks Madeleine places other heavy rocks
over Cameron’s body and Toby’s gear weighing it all down

Madeleine then pushes the sinking boat out into deeper water
where it slowly DISAPPEARS beneath the surface taking
Camerons body with it

Madeleine then wades out of the water and walks into the
woods vanishing from sight

Toby waits a moment and then climbs out of the underbrush He
moves to the water’s edge his face ashen

He slowly wades into the water

CUT TO

EXT UNDERWATER - EVENING

The wrecked rowboat rests on the dark rocky sea floor
fifteen feet below the surface

Toby swims down to it his eyes squinting to see in the near
darkness He looks into Cameron’s lifeless eyes for a moment
his face knotted with sadness and anger

Toby tears his eyes away from Cameron and digs through his
BACKPACK He finds what he’s looking for

The FLARE

He’s about to swim up to the surface when he looks back at
Cameron He rifles through Cameron’s pockets until he
finds

-the CELL PHONE

CUT TO

EXT TOBY’S CAMPSITE - NIGHT

Toby dripping wet walks back to his campsite examining the
waterlogged cell phone He presses “Talk” - nothing happens

Toby ejects the battery and wipes it dry He then blows air
through the various openings in the phone and puts it in his
pocket to dry

Toby stares grimly at the distant lighthouse and sees the
tiny figure of Alice walking across the bluff toward it
shotgun in hand

It’s too dangerous to go back there now

Toby looks down and sees his SKETCH BOOK lying hidden in tall
grass the pages gently turning in the breeze Toby picks up
the book and stares at the original drawing of Madeleine in
the shadows looking like a monster Now he knows for sure
she is one

And shell be back for him

CUT TO

EXT TOBY’S CAMPSITE - NIGHT

Toby tears branches off of a tree and uses his KNIFE to
whittle the ends into POINTS

He’s making SPEARS which he then hides in various places
within easy reach

Toby moves down the deer path looking for more branches
There’s a thick one hanging right across the path

He pulls it back as hard as he can but it won’t break and
it SLIPS out of his hand violently WHIPPING back over the
path

Toby’s eyes narrow an idea coming to him

CUT TO

EXT TOBY’S CAMPSITE - NIGHT

Toby uses one of his shoelaces to attach a whittled wooden
SPIKE onto the branch

He strains to pull the branch back as far as it will go and
then ties it in place with his other SHOELACE

He’s made a “tiger trap” with the taut shoelace acting as a
TRIPWIRE across the path

Toby twangs the lace with his finger testing the tension

CUT TO

EXT HILL NEAR TOBY’S CAMPSITE - NIGHT

Toby carrying a spear climbs up a grassy hillside in the
moonlight Near the top of the hill he finds a rocky
overhang with a cramped CRAWLSPACE underneath

He wedges himself into the crawlspace and then pulls TWIGS
and shrubs into the opening as CAMOUFLAGE

Noticing that some of the shrubs contain the Nightshade
berries that Madeleine saved him from eating he picks a few
and crushes them in his hand He then smears the juice on the
tip of his SPEAR making it POISONOUS

Toby peers out from his hiding place which gives him a good
view of anyone approaching the area

He looks at his watch - it’s 1108pm

CUT TO

EXT HILL NEAR TOBY’S CAMPSITE - LATER

Toby’s watch now reads 110 am He shifts uncomfortable in
the cramped space

He peers out through the camouflage and GOES STILL

At the bottom of the hill Madeleine walks out of the trees
into Tobys abandoned campsite

Toby stays silent watching Madeleine look around for him

Madeleine kneels on the ground scanning for FOOTPRINTS She
rises and moves slowly to the edge of the campsite She
studies the GRASS carefully

To Toby’s surprise she begins walking up the hill TOWARD HIS
HIDING PLACE

TOBY
(softly)
No fucking way

Madeleine pauses and looks around seeming to have lost his
trail She begins walking in a different direction down the
deer path toward the water

TOBY (CONTD)
(to himself)
That’s right Move along

Toby watches as Madeleine moves slowly down the path drawing
closer to the thin TRIPWIRE for the TIGER TRAP

TOBY (CONTD)
(grim)
Come on

Madeleine is only three steps away from the tripwire
-two steps one step

Madeleine slows to a stop She scans the area around her
then kneels and studies the grass at the side of the path
finding a FOOTPRINT

She rises to her feet and moves back AWAY from the tripwire
unaware of how close she came to springing Tobys trap

In the cave Toby grits his teeth frustrated

Madeleine moves carefully back into the camp following
Tobys faint trail She pauses looking around and then
smiles and begins walking UP THE HILL toward Tobys hiding
place again

TOBY (CONTD)
Shit

Madeleines eyes take in every bent blade of grass every
droplet of dew that Toby disturbed on his walk up the hill

Toby grips his spear tight as she draws closer knowing he’1l
need the element of surprise to stand a chance against
Madeleine - she needs to be CLOSE

She’s twenty feet away ten feet Toby readies the
spear

-but Madeleine STOPS ten feet away and stares right into
Tobys perfectly concealed hiding place

MADELEINE
Why are you hiding from me

Toby is silent for a moment He sees the HUNTING KNIFE tucked
into Madeleine’s dress Placing the spear out of sight behind
him he grabs his SWISS ARMY KNIFE and hides it in his palm
He removes the camouflage and looks at her

TOBY
My camp’s gone I figured your
mother found it

Toby climbs out of the crawlspace and faces Madeleine

MADELEINE
She did But I convinced her you
left

TOBY

(cold)
How exactly did you do that

MADELEINE
I was clever

She moves to him and runs her fingers through his hair as
Toby stares at her

ANGLE ON TOBYS HAND behind his back as he tries to open the
BLADE of the SWISS ARMY KNIFE with one hand

MADELEINE (CONTD)
It’s all right now Toby
(beat)
It’s just us

TOBY
Not really Not as long as your
mother’s still around

Toby slides his free hand onto Madeleine’s waist and she
looks down at it for a moment suspiciously

TOBY (CONTD)

How long until she figures out I’m
still here It’s a pretty small
island Madeleine

(Madeleine says nothing)
If she finds out I’m dead We both
know that

(beat)
Then it would just be you two
again All alone here

He pulls her closer to him Madeleine looks up into his eyes

BEHIND HIS BACK Toby still tries to open the blade but it’s
difficult with the splint on his finger

MADELEINE

That’s the way it is

(then coldly removes his

hand)
And I’m going to tell you this only
once Toby You don’t ever touch
me

(beat)
I touch you

She slides her fingers along Toby’s chest and slowly guides
him down to the ground so she’s lying on top of him Toby
deftly slides his knife-hand into tall grass where he
continues trying to open the blade Madeleine begins to kiss
his neck

TOBY
Madeleine I’ve got something to
say to you

Madeleine stops kissing him and looks in his eyes
IN THE GRASS - Toby’s fingers finally get the blade open

TOBY (CONTD)

I’m sorry for everything that’s
happened to you You deserved
better

(beat)
But maybe if you’d ever had a
friend in your life you’d know how
angry you’d be if some fucking
bitch killed him

Toby WHIPS the SWISS ARMY KNIFE out of the grass and STABS
Madeleine in the stomach

Madeleine is stunned and they both look down to where his
FIST is still pressed to her BLOOD STREAMS over Toby’s hand
and down her stomach

Toby slowly pulls back his hand realizing

it’s HIS BLOOD The FLIMSY BLADE CLOSED ON HIS FINGERS
slicing them deeply

Madeleine’s eyes FLARE and she grabs for her hunting knife
but Toby SHOVES her away and scrambles to his feet

He TAKES OFF RUNNING but Madeleine leaps up as well grabs a
STONE and HURLS it The stone rockets through the air and
glances off Toby’s HEAD sending him sprawling

Toby tumbles painfully down the hill landing HARD in a
gully

He lies there for a moment then painfully rises to his knees
and turns

but Madeleine grabs his FACE and slams his head to the
ground She knocks the Swiss Army knife from his hand jumps
on top of him and places the hunting knife over his EYE Toby
freezes

MADELEINE
Your friend died so you could live
Toby We saved your life

TOBY
He died because you fucking killed
him
MADELEINE
If I didn’t Mother would have
TOBY
(spits)

She’s not your mother

Madeleine goes silent her perspiring skin glistening in the
moonlight as she stares down at Toby

TOBY (CONTD)
She murdered your parents and stole
you Madeleine

MADELEINE
(fuming)
Youre lying

TOBY
That’s why no one’s allowed to see
you That’s why she keeps you in a
dirty basement on this fucking rock
all alone

(Madeleine GLARES at him)
People have been looking for you
Madeleine For years She’s not
protecting you she’s HIDING you
because you don’t belong to her

MADELEINE
(growing enraged)
I hate you
TOBY
You think this is how people live
It’s NOT She’s been lying to you
your whole life Madeleine If
there’s anyone who you should
fucking kill it’s HER
Madeleine grabs Toby’s hair in her fists ENRAGED
MADELEINE
(SMASHING his head into
ground repeatedly)
Stop it Stop it Stop it
Madeleine picks up a ROCK and RAISES IT eyes afire
TOBY
(barely conscious)
Your names Lucy
Madeleine SWINGS the ROCK down at his head and

SMASH TO BLACK

FADE IN

EXT HILL NEAR TOBY’S CAMPSITE - NIGHT

Close on Toby’s unconscious face on the ground The blood has
dried - time has passed Madeleine is GONE

A faint MELODY can be heard barely audible

“T used to love her but I had to kill her”

Toby’s eyes slowly open He winces with pain and gingerly
sits up

Hearing the FAINT MELODY he looks around confused Then
realizing what it is he DIGS in his pocket frantically and
pulls out

CAMERON’S CELL PHONE which is LIT UP and RINGING

TOBY
Holy shit
(quickly fumbles to open
it and answers)
Hey can you hear me

The phone BEEPS “SIGNAL FAILED CALL LOST”

TOBY (CONTD)
Fuck

Toby struggles to his feet and limps up the hill looking for
reception

Reaching the top he holds up the phone managing to get one
“bar” of reception

He dials 9-1-1 and waits

EMERGENCY OPERATOR (0C)
(filtered faint)
9-1-1 emergency

TOBY
(quickly urgently)
Listen I’m stuck on an island Two
people have been murdered Youve
gotta send police right now

EMERGENCY OPERATOR (0C)
Sir which island are you on

The phone BEEPS - “Critical Battery”

TOBY
(into phone)
I don’t know but there’s an
abandoned lighthouse on it

EMERGENCY OPERATOR (0C)
You’1l need to be more specific
sir There are dozens of abandoned
lighthouses

The phone BEEPS again Desperate Toby looks over the
treetops to the LIGHTHOUSE His eyes narrow

TOBY
(into phone)
Yeah well keep your eyes open

The phone flashes a final warning - “POWERING DOWN - PLEASE
RECHARGE”

TOBY (CONTD)
-one of thems about to light up

The phone goes DARK The battery is DEAD Toby slowly lowers
the phone his eyes locked on the lighthouse

CUT TO

EXT LIGHTHOUSE - NIGHT

Toby clutching the FLARE and his SPEAR crawls through
underbrush and looks across the bluff to the lighthouse
There’s no sign of movement

Toby climbs out of the brush and runs through the tall grass

Reaching the lighthouse wall he moves silently to the small
basement WINDOW

Careful not to make any noise he kneels and looks inside

In the small room below Madeleine sits on the cot clutching
the pink BABY PILLOW to her chest

Toby stares at her for a moment and then notices the
needlepoint inscription on the pillow Not only is the name
“Madeleine” embroidered on it but also a DATE “March 15
1978”

Toby looks at it for a moment then quietly backs away from
the window He rises and scans the area for Alice There’s no
sign of her

Toby sees an AX lying by a woodpile He immediately drops his
spear in favor of the ax and then quietly makes his way
around the lighthouse wall

To Toby’s relief the CHAIN still dangles from the railing
high above

Tucking the ax into his belt Toby grabs the chain and begins
to climb He struggles to make his way up the wall as
silently as possible his arms and legs straining

Higher and higher he climbs unwilling to look down

CUT TO

INT LIGHTHOUSE - LANTERN ROOM - NIGHT

Toby peers over the railing into the pitch-dark lantern room
making sure that he’s alone

The UNLIT LENSES are still turning from when he wound the
counterweights earlier

Toby hauls his body over the railing and lays the ax on the
floor

Kneeling by the light apparatus he peers into it locating
the WICK He pulls out the FLARE and is about to light it
when

the sound of a squeaky hinge

Toby squints into the darkness seeing

-the DOOR is slightly AJAR and swaying in the gentle
breeze Toby looks around in the pitch darkness but sees no
movement

Toby pulls the cap off the flare and prepares to light it

As the LARGE LENSES lens move slowly past him he looks
THROUGH THEM

and sees Alices FACE on the other side distorted and
warped by the lenses

Toby REELS BACK and grabs the AX

Alice RISES to her feet on the other side of the light
apparatus GLARING at him

TOBY
(gripping the ax)
Stay back
Alice slowly raises Leary’s SHOTGUN toward Toby
Checkmate
TOBY (CONTD)

(holds up his hand)
Wait

ALICE
No
She FIRES

CUT TO

INT BASEMENT - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

Madeleine still clutching the pillow hears the BLAST and
looks up alert

CUT TO

INT LIGHTHOUSE - LANTERN ROOM - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS
Toby FALLS BACK onto the floor the ax flying from his hand
The blast’s echo subsides and silence descends

Toby’s eyes slowly open He looks down at his chest where
there’s NO BLOOD Did she miss

He look up at Alice who

TOBY

(paling)
No

-FIRES AGAIN Toby SCREAMS and flinches as WHITE FIRE blasts
from the shotgun barrel

The echo again subsides as Toby cowers in the corner

He slowly sits up stunned Alice looks at the shotgun
frowning

Toby sees the spent SHOTGUN CARTRIDGE lying on the floor A
stencil on the side reads “BLANK”

TOBY (CONTD)
(with a bitter smile
remembering Leary)
That lying fuck

Toby grabs the AX and rises to his feet Alice slowly lowers
the gun but keeps her angry eyes on Toby

ALICE
You know you’re never leaving this
island

Toby ignites the FLARE which ILLUMINATES the whole room with
blinding RED LIGHT

TOBY
Watch me

Toby sticks the FLARE into the LIGHT APPARATUS

CUT TO

EXT PENOBSCOT BAY - NIGHT

From afar the lighthouse sends out an INTENSE BLOOD-RED
BEAM of LIGHT into the night sky

CUT TO

INT LIGHTHOUSE - LANTERN ROOM - NIGHT

Toby grips the ax as the brilliant beam sweeps past Alice’s
glaring face

TOBY
It’s over
(re the beam)
People will come The whole coast
can see that
Alice smiles as the brilliant light SWEEPS across her
ALICE
That may be
(beat)
But can you see
The light moves off Alice and suddenly Toby CANT SEE HER in
the darkness He squints as the light passes over his OWN
face BLINDING him
Toby steps backwards looking around
When the light illuminates Alice again shes to his LEFT
Shes toying with him moving around in the darkness

Toby squints into the darkness gripping the ax

Whoosh - Alice is illuminated off to Toby’s RIGHT Toby
SWINGS the ax

and hits nothing but air Alice is gone in the darkness

Toby steps back looking around He makes a dash for the
HANGING CHAIN to make his escape
As he grabs for it

the LIGHT sweeps past projecting his SHADOW on the
floor

-with ALICE’S SHADOW right next to it

Alice ATTACKS CLAWING AT HIS FACE Toby elbows her backwards
and she DISAPPEARS into the darkness again

Toby looks around squinting to see The light SWEEPS PAST
and now Alice is BEHIND TOBY

Toby instinctively spins SWINGING THE AX AT HER HEAD

Alice’s eyes go WIDE with SURPRISE caught off-guard He’s
GOT HER

But the ax STOPS an INCH from Alice’s head
A HAND caught it in mid-swing

The light sweeps past revealing Madeleine perched on the
railing by the hanging chain

Madeleine STAMPS on the side of Toby’s KNEE painfully
dropping him to the ground

She jerks the ax crushing Toby’s fingers against the
railing and then deftly FLIPS the ax into her own hand

Toby now defenseless backs away slowly

The light sweeps past illuminating Madeleine and Alice as
they stand motionless staring at him

ALICE (CONTD)
Kill him

Toby looks at Madeleine intently

TOBY
Listen to me Madeleine
(beat)
She isn’t your mother Her name’s
Alice Malkin and she stole you
because she killed her own
daughter
ALICE
(re the ax)
Give it to me Madeleine

Alice REACHES for the ax but Madeleine holds it away
conflicted

TOBY
(to Alice)
I know the story Your husband
ruined your little girl and you
lost your fucking mind

ALICE
(spits)
Shut your mouth

TOBY
(to Madeleine)
That baby pillow downstairs says
“Madeleine” was born in 1978
(beat)
Youre not thirty Do you even know
what year we’re in

ALICE
Don’t listen to him he’s lying

TOBY
(to Madeleine disgusted)
She gave you the same name as her
dead daughter Madeleine Do you
understand how sick that is

Madeleine slowly looks at her mother

TOBY (CONTD)
Look in her eyes and ask her

ALICE
(still looking at Toby)
Don’t you dare Madeleine

MADELEINE
Mother look at me
(Alice doesn’t move)
Look at me
Alice slowly turns to face Madeleine FUMING

MADELEINE (CONTD)
Are you

Alice SLAPS her HARD

Madeleine’s expression grows cold She straightens up and
meets her mother’s eyes again defiant

ALICE
I will never forgive you for this
Madeleine

MADELEINE
Say it

Furious Alice tries to SLAP her again but Madeleine CATCHES
her hand and GRIPS IT firmly

For the first time a look of FEAR washes across Alice’s
face She smiles sadly and gently strokes Madeleine’s
beautiful face

ALICE
I’m your mother just as you’re
my Madeleine
(smiles)

Youve always been my Madeleine

Madeleine studies her for a second tears forming in her
eyes

When Madeleine doesn’t say anything for a moment Alice
slowly slides the AX from Madeleine’s hands and steps past
her glaring at Toby

Toby backs away realizing he’s totally fucked

TOBY
Madeleine

But Madeleine just stares ahead NUMB Alice SWINGS the ax
and Toby DUCKS stumbling backwards and landing painfully on
the pile of chains and tools

Alice raises the ax for the KILL

A blur behind Alice

To Toby’s surprise Alice goes MOTIONLESS the ax still
raised

Blood begins to seep from a thin cut across Alices THROAT
She slowly turns and sees Madeleine standing behind her
Madeleine’s eyes are BLANK and TERRIFYING The HUNTING KNIFE
is in her hand blood coating the blade

Alice’s body shudders She attempts to speak but it comes
out as a GURGLE

MADELEINE
(cold to Alice)
I don’t hear you Mother

Alice SLUMPS FORWARD onto the floor dead

Toby stares up at Madeleine as the brilliant RED LIGHT passes
over her Her eyes are aflame with rage - truly terrifying in
their savagery Madeleine’s face and sundress are stained
with blood her tanned skin glistening with sweat

She walks slowly toward Toby and strokes his face her
fingers leaving smears of blood on his skin

This is the awakening for Madeleine The girl is gone The
animal has taken over

Madeleine stares into Toby’s eyes She then pulls his face to
hers her tongue entering his mouth hungrily

Repulsed Toby tries to push her back but Madeleine WRENCHES
his arm behind him She uses her other hand to tear open his
BELT her eyes locked on his

TOBY
Madeleine don’t

Madeleine YANKS his belt off of him Toby puts his palm on
Madeleine’s FACE but she deflects his hand and rips open his
shirt

TOBY (CONTD)
Goddamnit stop

Toby wrestles his arm free and tries to make a move for the
ax but Madeleine grabs his hand

Toby is stunned at how STRONG her grip is

TOBY (CONTD)
Listen to me People are coming

MADELEINE
(touches his face)
They’ve come before
(reassuring)
They never find us

Madeleine runs the bloody HUNTING KNIFE over Toby’s
perspiring throat as the red light washes over them

MADELEINE (CONT’D)
This is going to happen Toby Do
you understand

Toby eyes the bloody knife then looks at her He slowly
nods

Madeleine KISSES him deeply her tongue probing in his mouth
Toby responds in kind

As the kiss gets more intense Toby LIFTS Madeleine so her
legs are around his waist and Madeleine glares at him
preferring to be in control

After a moment Madeleine hikes her sundress up higher and
reaches down between them and her eyes flare with animal
sexuality as she finds what she’s looking for

Madeleine’s eyes close as she lowers herself down onto him
Toby grips her tightly as reluctantly turned on as he is
furious

Toby steps away from the wall supporting her weight as the
RED LIGHT passes over them

Madeleine grabs at his hair pulling his mouth to hers her
other hand still gripping the bloody knife

Toby rests Madeleine on the RAILING Madeleine’s breathing
becomes more and more furious as she begins to climax

Toby then STOPS his movements
Madeleine looks up at him flushed

MADELEINE (CONTD)
I didn’t tell you to stop

Toby looks into her eyes
TOBY
I’m sorry Madeleine but this
really isn’t working for me
(beat)
I’1l1 call you
He SHOVES her over the railing

Madeleine SCREAMS and grabs out for him as she FALLS
snagging his HAND

Toby surprised is dragged over as well but his KNEE grips
the railing halting their fall

Toby cries out in agony as Madeleine hangs from his BROKEN
HAND sixty feet over the ground

Madeleine glares up into his eyes furious

-as the makeshift SPLINT begins to SLIDE OFF Toby’s hand
Her eyes flare as the splint SLIPS OFF and Madeleine
PLUMMETS sixty feet landing HARD on the ground far below
Toby strains to pull himself back over the railing and he
slumps to the floor of the lantern room exhausted and
gripping his hand

Toby slowly rises and looks over the railing Far below he

sees Madeleine lying motionless in the tall reeds her body
bent in a hideous position her eyes open and lifeless

Toby looks out to sea The sun is just beginning to rise over
the horizon The BLOOD RED beam of the lighthouse sweeps
across the water

In the distance Toby sees
a COAST GUARD BOAT headed toward the island
Toby SCREAMS elated

CUT TO

EXT LIGHTHOUSE - DAWN

Toby slides himself carefully down the chain gingerly
favoring his broken finger until he reaches the ground

Looking out to sea he sees that the Coast Guard boat is
still headed toward the island but not directly at the
lighthouse

TOBY
Where the hell are you going

He looks down the cliff at the jagged rocks below realizing
that the boat is probably headed for a better landing spot
Sure enough it appears the boat (still in the distance) is
headed for the beach near his camp

Toby glances over to the tall reeds where Madeleine fell He
grabs the SPEAR he dropped in the grass earlier

Gripping the spear he slowly moves through the reeds
Up ahead is a GAP in the tall reeds where Madeleine landed
Toby raises the spear and steps forward

There are BLOODSTAINS on the reeds but NO SIGN OF MADELEINE

Toby spins around scanning the area around him
All is silent Toby can barely breathe Where is she

Casting one more look around Toby TAKES OFF sprinting into
the woods headed toward where the boat will land

CUT TO

EXT WOODS - DAY

Toby RACES through the woods leaping over fallen trees and
ducking under low branches

He reaches a sudden drop and tumbles painfully into a gulch
He recovers quickly and rises to his feet

Toby studies the woods around him carefully trying to sense
any movement

All is still

Toby then hears a noise like something moving through the
air FAST Toby DUCKS as a STONE STRIKES a tree next to his
head sending chunks of wood flying

The spear drops from Toby’s hand as he reacts

Toby sees Madeleine at the very top of the gulch above him
winding up to throw another stone

Toby TAKES OFF leaving his spear behind and disappears into
the trees

CUT TO

EXT WOODS - DAY

Toby leaps over the stream He’s getting close to his camp
He looks back There’s no sign of Madeleine

He sprints on desperately crashing through trees

CUT TO

EXT TOBY’S CAMPSITE - DAY

Toby bursts through the underbrush out of breath

He looks down the deer path toward the water In the
distance he sees the BOAT less than half a mile off and
headed his way

TOBY
(tense)
Faster you fuck Come on

Toby moves along the path toward the beach when

MADELEINE (0S)
It won’t reach you in time

Toby whirls around but there’s no one there Only trees

TOBY
Madeleine stop this

MADELEINE (0S)
(from another direction)
We could have been so happy Toby

Toby looks toward where the voice came from but he cant see
her Shes moving around - toying with him

Toby pulls out his small SWISS ARMY KNIFE and extends the
blade

TOBY
Listen to me Madeleine You’re as
much a victim here as anyone
(beat)
There are people who can help you
You might even have family

A twig snaps to his right Toby spins and studies the
underbrush but sees no movement

Toby backs warily down the path moving through TALL GRASS
MADELEINE (0S)
It doesn’t matter Toby
(beat)
I’m hurt I’m going to die

A BREEZE blows through the grass and reeds around him

MADELEINE (0S) (CONTD)
I want us to die here

Madeleine silently rises from the grass BEHIND HIM holding
the HUNTING KNIFE

MADELEINE (CONT’D)
where we belong

Toby SPINS and throws up his hands but it’s too late
Madeleine SLASHES at him cutting deeply across Toby’s palms

He falls backwards onto the ground

With a feral yell Madeleine LEAPS THROUGH THE AIR toward
him RAISING THE KNIFE to deliver the death blow

but Tobys hand snakes out with the SWISS ARMY KNIFE
--and CUTS THE BOOT LACE springing the “Tiger Trap

The SPIKED BRANCH WHIPS FREE and STREAKS TOWARD MADELEINE
The spike RIPS INTO HER ARM and SLAMS her backwards

Madeleine SCREAMS in pain as blood runs down her arm

Toby watches stunned as Madeleine begins to PULL the spike
out of her arm glaring at him

Toby gets to his feet and sprints away down the path toward
the water

CUT TO

EXT ROCKY BEACH - DAY

Toby scrambles down the steep rocks and runs across the
beach waving his arms to the Coast Guard boat which is
still too far off to see him

Toby DIVES into the water and swims frantically toward the
boat to close the distance Weighed down by his clothes he
stops swimming and rips off his shirt and pants

Toby then glances back at the beach

Madeleine is standing at the waters edge staring at him
Blood streams down her arm

She slowly wades into the water her gaze never wavering

When Madeleine is waist-deep she SUBMERGES disappearing
from sight

TOBY
Shit

Toby swims hard toward the boat Looking back he sees that
Madeleine STILL HASNT SURFACED

He has no idea where she is

Toby swims as fast as he can toward the oncoming boat which
is still several hundred yards away

Toby’s arms pump his breath fevered
TOBY (CONTD)
(waving desperately to the
boat)
Hey Over here

He squints hoping for some sign that the driver saw him
Toby is suddenly YANKED UNDERWATER
A moment laterhe SURFACES AGAIN coughing
Before he can take another breath he’s YANKED DOWN AGAIN

CUT TO

EXT UNDERWATER —- DAY
Toby struggles to free himself from the grip of

Madeleine in the dark water below him holding his FOOT
and pulling him further down

Toby kicks and struggles bubbles streaming from his nose and
mouth

Madeleine’s hand snakes out grabbing his other foot and
BINDING THEM TOGETHER with her arms

Toby looks up

as the dark shadow of the BOAT passes overhead without
slowing and continues on out of sight

The driver didnt see him
Madeleine deftly CLIMBS UP Toby’s body as he tries to fend
her off Her sense of movement is uncanny and she seems to

have a counter-move for everything he tries

Madeleine’s feet interlock around Toby’s trapping his legs
Her arms snake around his body entangling his arms

Toby chokes out his air as he tries to writhe free while
Madeleine seems completely unfazed and calm

Toby looks up toward the shimmering surface It may as well
be a hundred miles away

His face says it all as he stares upward - he knows he’s
going to die

Toby and Madeleine slowly drift toward the bottom and Toby
looks into her face realizing

Shes not going to save herself - she wants them to drown
TOGETHER

Toby gives one last attempt to free himself but he’s too
weak The last of his air streams from his nose

His head lolls back

Madeleine holds him almost tenderly She looks into his eyes
as they close Toby’s body goes limp

She gently releases his hands and softly kisses his lips as
they drift to the bottom

Tobys HAND slowly slides to the back of her head
-and PRESSES HER FACE TO HIS

Madeleine’s eyes go WIDE as Toby literally SUCKS THE AIR
FROM HER LUNGS

Madeleine THRASHES as panic affects her motor control Toby
does his best to restrain her and Madeleine involuntarily
inhales WATER which fills her lungs

Her body TWITCHES with the shock and her eyes meet Toby’s
Madeleine’s grip on Toby’s clothes slowly eases Toby looks
into her eyes as her mouth falls limply open Her eyes roll
back in her head

She’s dead

Toby releases her and Madeleine drifts slowly away from him
almost angelic in death

Toby watches her for a moment and then swims upwards Before
cresting the surface he looks back down into the depths and
sees Madeleine’s body drifting slowly out of sight

CUT TO

EXT WATER — DAY

Toby surfaces and breathes deeply taking in fresh air He
looks toward shore where the Coast Guard boat has landed

We PULL BACK as Toby begins the long swim to shore

FADE OUT
