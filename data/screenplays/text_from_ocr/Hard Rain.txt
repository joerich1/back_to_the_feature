when I saw the front door to a house
was open I pulled my gun -- afraid
it might be looters Imagine my
surprise when instead of a looter
I find a young woman handcuffed to
the railing of her stairs Her name
was Karen and ever since she came
back from college shed made it clear
she was too good for any of us local
folk Now here she was in handcuffs
I said What the heck is going on
here maam And she said

Karen says nothing Wayne leans in close

Sorry Wayne but Im not playing a

Im sure you can hurt me But its
all going to be the same when Im
dead
