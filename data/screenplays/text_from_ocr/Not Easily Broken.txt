NOT EASILY BROKEN

Screenplay by

Based on the Novel by TD Jakes

Writers First Draft
May 15 2006
The SCREEN is filled with a heavenly WHITE glow as we begin
HEARING some love anthem -- something along the lines of like
Whitney Houston’s “I BELIEVE IN ME AND YOU”

FADE IN

EXT EMMANUEL FELLOWSHIP CHURCH - ESTABLISHING - DAY And the white glow becomes blue sky and we FIND the tip of a
church steeple reaching to heaven And as we WIDEN we see
that it’s attached to a small white clapboard church
somewhere in the suburbs of a big city A SIGN out front
tells us where we are and the late-model cars parked out
front tell us when the early 1990s And as the CAMERA
continues its move we settle on a WHITE ROSE in the fg

DISSOLVE TO

INT EMMANUEL FELLOWSHIP CHURCH - SANCTUARY - DAY Which becomes an entire BOUQUET of WHITE ROSES And then the
CAMERA will carry us to soft CLOSE UPS of a wedding ceremony
in progress

SUNLIGHT streaming in an stained glass window and pointing to
an ornate cross on a church wall

The lapel of a tuxedo jacket adorned with a tie made of a
colorful African fabric

The beautiful train of a wedding gown surrounded by white
rose petals on the red carpet

Two black hands one soft and feminine and one masculine and
athletic lighting a unity candle

An open Bible in a strong BLACK MINISTER’S hands

A handkerchief wiping tears from old black eyes in the
audience

A glistening diamond ring is slipped by the masculine hand
onto a soft feminine finger

Two pairs of moist lips meet in a passionate kiss

As the SONG ENDS we’1ll WIDEN from the kiss to reveal
handsome sturdily-built tuxedoed DAVE JOHNSON probably 25
embracing his gorgeous not-much-younger bride CLARICE CLARK-
JOHNSON And as they hold their kiss for what seems like too
long we see that we are in a nicely appointed sanctuary
filled with happy mostly black WEDDING GUESTS

The Fade hairstyles on the men and Anita Baker bobs on the
women date us to the early 1990s

ANOTHER ANGLE

They are all presided over by larger-than-life BISHOP WILKES
dressed in ministerial robes with colorful Afrocentric
accents He taps Dave on the shoulder

BISHOP WILKES
How about saving some for the
honeymoon brother

Dave and Clarice break their clutch slightly embarrassed
and the audience erupts in LAUGHTER and a few HOOTS and
HOLLAS from some of the men including handsome young Best
Man BROCK HOUSEMAN the lone Caucasian member of the wedding
party And he’s the got an all-business-up-front-party-in-
back mullett going for him which puts him right out of
college and not yet quite legit

Dave and Clarice now turn to face the Bishop He smiles at
them broadly and holds up his Bible again

BISHOP WILKES (CONTD)
Dave Clarice before I present
you as husband and wife there’s
one last lesson I want to leave
with you as you begin your life
together A wise king named
Solomon once said this
(reading from Bible)
“It is better to have a partner
than go through life alone Share
the work share the wealth for if
one falls down the other is there
to pick him up But pity the man
who falls and has no one by his
side And in bed two can warm
each other at night But one
alone shivers all night long By
yourself you are unprotected But
with a partner you can face the
worst the world has to offer But
even better is a cord of three
strands because it is not easily

broken”
(beat closing his Bible)
My brother my sister I’ll be

honest with you Life is gonna do
its best to beat you up And it’s
hard to keep the good in a good
marriage when bad things happen

The Bishop then retrieves a gold-colored braided cord and
places one end around Dave’s shoulders and then drapes the
other end around Clarice’s shoulders

BISHOP WILKES (CONTD)
This is a three-stranded cord The
two of you represent the first two
strands but God represent the
third And as long as you stay
close to God and His family I
promise your marriage will be a
three-stranded cord that nothing in
this world can break

And as Dave and Clarice nod that they understand the
admonition we’ll FIND Clarice’s 50-something very strong-
willed mother MARY CLARK or MAMA as we will come to know
her sitting all by herself in the front row And she’s
watching these proceedings with uncertain skeptical eyes

And well PRELAP the smooth sounds of BLACK wedding DJ and
the end of some R and B number like “AIN’T NO WAY”

DJ (V0)
All right give it up for sister
Aretha

DISSOLVE TO

INT EMMANUEL FELLOWSHIP CHURCH - RECEPTION HALL - DAY The place has been decorated for a wedding reception
Tables linens disco ball and rotund DJ with his sound
system set up in front of a dance floor packed with guests
including Bishop Wilkes who is mixing it up with his WIFE

DI
Step aside peeps DJ Supersize
comin’ at you now with a special
dance request

The wedding guests begin clearing the dance floor
DJ (CONTD)
Time for the bride’s own mama Mrs
Mary Clark to step on the floor
with her new son-in-law

Mama smiles coyly as she takes to the floor

DJ CONTD)
(suggestively)
Lord have mercy Mrs Clark Could
you be my mama ‘cuz I love the

way you cookin’ tonight

Which draws HOOTS and HOWLS from across the hall She waves
him off with mock humility

CLOSER ANGLE

At the edge of the crowd Dave is standing with his new bride
and his best man Brock with whom he trades a hesitant look

DAVE
Oh damn

CLARICE
(rolling her eyes)
Please She ain’t gonna bite you

Dave starts moving sheepishly out onto the floor Brock
calls after him and doing his best Vanilla Ice impression

BROCK
I got your back dawg

Clarice elbows Brock in the ribs as Dave joins Mama to the
APPLAUSE of the wedding guests

DJ
This one goes out to all you mamas
From my man Babyface

Mama plasters on a smile and puts her arms around Dave’s
neck He puts his hands appropriately around her waist as
the DJ throws the switch on a tune like “SONG FOR MY MAMA”
And they dance together for a long moment as Clarice and some
of her bridesmaids watch their emotions brimming over the
beautiful scene

CLOSER ANGLE

Mama pulls in close and begins to talk in hushed tones to
Dave her manufactured smile never leaving her face

MAMA
Welcome to the family baby

DAVE
Thank you Mrs Clark

MAMA
(admonishingly)
Boy I know you did not just call
me “Mrs Clark” I expect you to
call me “Mama” Just like I expect
you and my Reesie at my house every
week for Sunday dinner

DAVE
(taken aback)
Yes ma’am

MAMA
Just like I expect you to learn how
to hold a job keep food on the
table and stay away from all them
ghetto-pass-carryin’ crack-dealin’
street hustlers you used to run
with I don’t care if you did
graduate from college I will not
see my baby girl have anything less
than the life she deserves

DAVE
No ma’am

MAMA
And one more thing You a man so
you probably can’t help yourself
but if I ever catch you puttin’
your eyes on some little Miss Thang
who ain’t my daughter I will
personally come over there like
Jesus and pluck them out Are you
feelin’ me

A shell-shocked Dave looks at her for a long moment There’s
a lot he would like to say but he thinks better of it

DAVE
I feel you

Mama’s smile says that’s exactly how she wants it to be
Just then Clarice taps her mother on the shoulder

CLARICE
My turn Mama

MAMA
Yes it is baby
(patting Dave on cheek)
This boy and me gonna get along
just fine

And with that Mama moves off into the crowd As Clarice and
Dave begin to dance the DJ transitions us into Lionel
Richie’s “THREE TIMES A LADY” Clarice notices that Dave is
a little shaken by his encounter with Mama

CLARICE
I know Mama can come on a little
strong
DAVE
More like a Mack truck
CLARICE
She just wants the best for me
DAVE
I know
CLARICE

(smiling seductively)
But she ain’t comin’ where we goin’
tonight

Which quickly snaps Dave out of his funk

DAVE
Did I mention how good you look in
that dress

CLARICE
Yes But do you know how good I’m
gonna look out of it

DAVE
(eyes heaven gratefully)
Thank you Jesus

And as they share an expectation of intimacy that only a new
groom and bride can share Clarice will pull Dave into a
kiss And suddenly it will be as if they are all alone in
the world with space and time SPINNING AROUND THEM And we
will begin to hear Dave’s REMEMBERING VOICE as the song
continues to play

DAVE (VO) (CONTD)
When I was growing up on my
Granny’s knee we were poor as
church mice Scratch that The
church mice were the rich ones We
were the church rats But it
didn’t matter because Granny raised
me to know right from wrong

(MORE)

DAVE (VO) (CONTD)

And before she passed on God rest
her soul she worked her fingers to
the bone makin’ sure I could get
out the hood makin’ sure I could
be a college boy And she was the
only woman I ever worshipped until
the day I met a young lady in
college who could make Halle Berry
want to eat her heart out

INT DAVE’S PANEL VAN - DAY - TRAVELING (PRESENT DAY)

Were still CLOSE ON Dave only now he looks a dozen years
older in a work shirt that marks him as working class A few
more worry lines around the eyes A few gray hairs dusting
his temples And somehow “THREE TIMES A LADY” never quit
playing In fact we’re now hearing it on the car radio But
as Dave drives along he is deep in thought

On the other side of the boulevard a Police cruiser zooms
past its SIREN WAILING pulling Dave out of his thoughts
He inadvertently flips the radio dial to a NEWSTALK station

DAVE (V0O)
But just like the Bishop said life
has a way of knocking the hell out
of you

Well PULL OUTSIDE the van far enough to read the sign on the
side of his truck “ALL-PRO JANITORIAL and CARPET CLEANING”

CUT TO

EXT JOHNSON HOUSE - ESTABLISHING - DAY - LATER

Dave’s van pulls into the driveway of a nice upper middle-
class home in a neighborhood full of similar homes (This is
not the starter home we saw them buy but a step up into the
suburbs) A recent model Cadillac V-Series is already
sitting in the driveway with one of those magnetic signs
plastered on the door “HASTINGS PROPERTIES and REAL ESTATE”

EXT JOHNSON HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY - MOMENT LATER

Clarice still looking as girlishly trim and put-together as
she did on her wedding day is noshing on a salad at a sit-up
bar in the well-appointed kitchen while reading House
Beautiful magazine She’s dressed smartly in a sexy blouse
and skirt as Dave enters He brightens when he sees her

DAVE
Damn girl All those curves and
me with no brakes

CLARICE
Hey baby

Dave crosses over moves in for a kiss But she turns her
cheek to him

CLARICE (CONTD)
Sorry I just touched up my face

Dave shrugs it off Gives her a peck on the cheek

CLARICE (CONTD)
How was your day

Dave opens the fridge and pops the top on a bottle of beer

DAVE
I had to do the bank building
myself because two of my boys
called in sick I tell you
Reesie why I let you talk me into
starting my own business I’m still
trying to figure out

CLARICE
(slightly irritated)
Baby we been over all this
Coaching JV football wasn’t puttin’
us in this zip code You just got
to do a better job of hiring the
right people

Dave has heard this lecture before and Clarice can see he’s
tired of it She softens her approach

CLARICE (CONTD)
Besides you think I want my big
strong chocolate kiss waxin’ floors
for a livin’ I want you in the
executive suite where you deserve
to be

Dave gives her a reluctant smile The sweets worked

DAVE
I know Boo

He comes around behind her Starts massaging her shoulders

DAVE (CONTD)
Whaddya say we forget all that
nonsense tonight and get us little
quality time

She melts a little at his touch but remembers her job

CLARICE
Oh that sounds so good But I got
to show houses tonight

DAVE
What about tomorrow

CLARICE
That’s no good either It’s my
real estate board dinner You

DAVE
(blanching at reminder)
Oh shit that’s right

CLARICE
(looks at him askance)

in this house about Mama

Clarice puts on her colorful real-estate blazer

CLARICE (CONTD)
I tell you what If you show Mama

freak on Saturday night

She nibbles on his ear a little Dave’s jelly Clarice
knows it Right where she wants him

CLARICE (CONTD)
I’1l even throw in one of those
lacy numbers that gets you all weak
in the knees

Dave looks her in the eye hopefully

DAVE
Maybe we could also you know
talk about the future

CLARICE

Let’s not go there baby You know
I’m not ready for that

She gives him another peck on the cheek and exits His
countenance falls as he watches her go

EXT DOWNTOWN CONDOMINIUM HIGHRISE - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT

As we SWOOP DOWN over Dallas after dark it’s all glass and
prisms of light especially in the priciest piece of real
estate in town the 40-story Trinity View condo building

INT BROCK HOUSEMAN’S DOWNTOWN CONDO - NIGHT

Were CLOSE ON the timer of fancy blender whose jar contains
water and some kind of protein powder The timer hits 615

pm and the machine suddenly whirs to life blending up its
contents into some kind of green health drink

And we’1ll WIDEN to see that we are in a gourmet kitchen in
very upscale bachelor condo with skyrise views on three
sides The place looks like a Bang and Olufsen store threw up
-- leather furniture modern art giant plasma screen TV on
the wall and all the digital trappings

At that moment the front door opens and Brock Houseman
enters looking as fit and handsome as ever his college-boy
mullett replaced with close-cropped George Clooney hair He
throws off his expensive suit coat and loosens a tie as he
crosses over to his telephone on the kitchen counter

He punches in a phone number then his voice-mail code and
puts the phone to his ear as he pours his smoothie into a
glass and begins chugging as he listens

COMPUTER VOICE (OVER PHONE)
Four new messages

He punches a key to listen

FEMALE VOICE 1 (OVER PHONE)
(flirty and sexy)
Hey Cowboy it’s Vickie It’s
been too long since the last time
we hooked up I got the hot tub
heating up in case you’re lonely
tonight

Brock gulps weakly and steels his courage

BROCK
Stay strong bro

He pushes a key and we hear the ERASE tone Then the next
message begins to play

OLDER FEMALE VOICE (OVER PHONE)
Hi sweetie pie this is Mom Are
you getting my messages Something
must be wrong with your system
Anyway my friend Sophie has this
really lovely niece who sings in
the church choir and you won’t
believe what she does for a living
-- she’s a professional bowler
Isn’t that fun Anyway I thought
maybe I could have the two of you
over for dinner Friday and --

Brock sighs and punches to ERASE the message

BROCK
Sorry Mom I’m having my finger
nails ripped out that night

And then yet one more feminine voice comes on the line

FEMALE VOICE (OVER PHONE)
Hi Brock this is Partygirl 229
Remember me from Singles Chat-dot-
com I got your number from
Surferdude 102 who it got it froma
friend of his who knows how to
track people down I was thinking
we could meet for drinks and --

Brock punches the ERASE button looks at the phone horrified

BROCK
Okay now I’m officially scared

Finally a voice he wants to hear comes on the line

DAVE (OVER PHONE)

Yo B it’s Dave Reesie’s working
tonight If your lawyer ass ain’t
too busy what do you say we get
our hoops on Holler back at me

Brock smiles relieved as he hangs up the phone
BROCK
(like a black guy)
Now that’s what I’m talking about

CUT TO

EXT ALL SAINTS HOSPITAL - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT

We’re HIGH and WIDE on an imposing downtown hospital with
heavy Catholic influence on the facade As we PUSH IN we
FIND an ambulance parked at the emergency entrance And just
at that moment its SIRENS and LIGHTS come on and it peels
away from the hospital on its way to only God knows where

INT ALL SAINTS HOSPITAL - PT CLINIC - NIGHT

We’re CLOSE ON a bare leg with a fresh surgical scar at the
knee joint engaged in a knee-extension exercise and WIDEN to
see an OLDER MALE PATIENT painfully raising his leg as a
pretty perky physical therapist in her early 30s coaches him
through it She is not a stone fox but Meg Ryan sexy --
despite the perspiration on her brow and the fatigue of a
long shift in a busy PT clinic

JULIE
Just a few more Jerry Before you
know it you’ll have that new
bionic knee out on the dance floor

OLDER MALE PATIENT
It hurts like hell
(mischievous smile)
Maybe you could kiss it and make it
better

JULIE
(rolls eyes teasingly)
Behave yourself

She calls to a passing PT ASSISTANT

JULIE (CONTD)
Electrical stim then ice for
Mister Hound Dog here

(smiling at Jerry)
On second thought no stimulation
He’s already had enough of that

Julie trades another smile and a wink with Leonard as the PT
Assistant takes over for her

ANOTHER ANGLE

TRACK Julie over to the bullpen where she hands Jerry’s chart
to a middle-aged humorless-looking OFFICE SUPERVISOR

JULIE (CONTD)
Okay Nick who’s my next victim

The supervisor just stares at her -- flatly

JULIE (CONTD)
It was a joke That would be where
I say something funny and you make
this little noise called a laugh

SUPERVISOR
We got a memo from corporate

JULIE
What’d it say They taking away
our vending machine No more
Little Debbies at snack break

He hands her the memo Her smile fades as she reads it

She throws

JULIE (CONTD)
Part time Are you kidding me
The patient load is higher than
it’s ever been

SUPERVISOR
Costs are up We’re going to have
to figure out a way to see same
number of clients in half the time

JULIE
Cheap-frigging-HMO What’s next --
instead of Viagra a Popsicle stick
and duct tape

SUPERVISOR
I’m sorry Julie I don’t know
what to tell you

JULIE
I’m raising a 12-year-old son How
do I replace this income

SUPERVISOR
Look you’re my best therapist
I’ll try to throw some freelance
work your way

JULIE
Don’t bother I’11 just sell one

of my organs Who needs two
kidneys anyway

up her hands in frustration and crosses out

EXT JOHNSON HOUSE - NIGHT

A shiny black BMW with high performance tires pulls into Dave
and Clarice’s driveway and HONKS its horn From inside some
clean-enough-for-radio RAP SONG from a high-end sound system

INT BROCK’S BMW - NIGHT - MOMENT LATER

Brock now dressed in ratty gym clothes is sitting in the
car RAPPING along with the song throbbing on the Blaupunkt
when the passenger door opens and Dave slides in He’s also
wearing sweats and carrying a basketball Brock offers his
fist to Dave for a knuckle-bump

BROCK
(loudly over Rap song)
What up D how you doin’

Dave can hardly hear him over the radio

DAVE
Hey Grandmaster Flash you wanna
chill the jams before one of my
white neighbors has a heart attack

BROCK
Sorry bro My bad

Brock turns down the volume Dave chuckles as Brock backs his
car out of the driveway This sort of blackwhite repartee
is obviously something that’s part of their friendship

INT BROCK’S BMW - TRAVELING - NIGHT - A MOMENT LATER

They have now left Dave’s neighborhood and are proceeding
toward downtown the skyline closing in out the window

BROCK
Glad you called me tonight man

DAVE
Saved from another lonely night in
that million-dollar penthouse huh

BROCK
It’s two million but who’s
counting Besides I could be
hitting it with any number of

ladies if I wanted to
(MORE)

BROCK (CONTD)

I’m just taking a little break

right now to get my head straight

you know what I’m saying Long as

I got my “Good Times” reruns it’s

all good

Dave doesn’t know whether to laugh or be weirded out

DAVE
Tell me you do not watch “Good
Times”

BROCK

I love that show It reminds me of
when I was just a shorty living in
the ghet-to

DAVE
Please A white trash trailer park
ain’t no ghetto

BROCK
(winking at Dave)
I know but I’m just trying to keep
it real for my main homey ya’ll

DAVE
(chuckling)
Has anybody ever told you that you
are one strange Caucasian

BROCK
(dropping black patois)
This coming from a black guy who
lives in the whitest neighborhood
in the city

Brock smiles offers his palm Dave has to give him some
skin on that one These guys have a real bond

EXT HASTINGS REAL ESTATE - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT

A classy real estate office building with lovely landscaping
and a sign matching the magnetic placard on Clarice’s
Cadillac which is just now pulling into a parking spot
INT HASTINGS REAL ESTATE - NIGHT - MOMENT LATER

When Clarice enters she is instantly waylaid by MICHELLE

her sassy brassy late-20s black assistant who has opinions
on every subject and is not shy about sharing them

MICHELLE
Okay girlfriend here’s the four-
one-one

She hands Clarice a file folder and points through a window
into her office where an upscale professional-looking black
couple THE REIDS are waiting

MICHELLE (CONTD)
Mr Superior Court Judge in there

SMASH CUT TO

INT DOWNTOWN GYMNASIUM - CLOSE ON BASKETBALL - NIGHT

As it SLAMS THROUGH THE NET and then WIDEN to see we’re in
an inner-city gymnasium in the middle of a shirts-and-skins
pick-up basketball game

Dave comes down hard having just slammed-dunked the ball
over a tatted-up street-looking black dude in his 30s we’ll
come to know as DARNELL GOODEN Dave thumps his bare
sweaty chiseled chest proudly and exchanges high-fives with
bare-chested Brock and then a couple of his other African-
American TEAMMATES Darnell is fuming

DARNELL
That was charging dawg

DAVE
Gimme the lane if you don’t want my
foot in your hind parts homey
(motions for the ball)
Ball

Darnell casts an angry look at Dave One of the other
players chunks the ball to Dave who takes it to the baseline

Dave takes the ball in tossing it to one of his teammates a
really BIG DUDE with a perpetual smile and we’1l TRACK him
as he begins dribbling the ball down court as Darnell and his
team get back on defense And for a long time it’s all
passes and shiny bodies slamming into one another And then
Dave gets the ball back and sees Brock in the open in three-
point territory And the action we’ll STROBE into

SERIES OF SLOW-MOTION SHOTS
A) Dave fires a chest past to Brock
B) Darnell sees what’s happening and moves into action

C) As Brock goes up for his shot a black fist flies INTO
FRAME and connects with his face -- hard

D) Brock slams to the floor and the ball goes rolling out of
bounds and we’ll be overtaken by REAL TIME once again

Brock jumps to his feet blood gushing from his nose and
immediately charges Darnell And soon they are a whirling
dervish of flying kicks and punches and Dave and some of the
other players immediately rush in to break it up

DAVE (CONTD)
Yo knock it off Break it up

Finally Dave and a teammate are able to pry them apart and
Brock and Darnell both come out of the tussle spitting mad

BROCK
(glaring at Darnell)
What the hell was that man

DARNELL
(thrusts a finger at Dave)
Nigger wanted street rules

DAVE
You better check yourself brother
You ain’t in the prison yard no
more

Rage fills Darnell’s eyes and he suddenly charges Dave
pinning him to the wall before Brock and the others can pull
them apart Dave is quaking with frustration disbelief

DAVE (CONTD)
What is your problem fool

DARNELL
You college boy strollin’ up in
here with your suburb-livin’ white
ass-kissin’ nose in the air
(pointing at Brock)
bringin’ this lil’ Jimmy Crack
Corn which you

Dave flares at this and trades an uncomfortable look with
Brock but thinks better of fanning the flames

DAVE
Come on brother we homeys from
way back Why you got to sweat me
like that

DARNELL
You used to be good people when you
wasn’t too good for the hood But
forget this shit I ain’t rollin’
with no Uncle Tom

Darnell picks up the ball and fires it to the Big Dude who
no longer has a smile Darnell starts to walk off Brock
tries one last appeal

BROCK
Let’s just finish the game
Darnell No harm no foul

DARNELL
(turning back glaring)
Shut up punk Go back to
Starbucks

With that Darnell is out of there leaving nothing but
frustrated looks all around especially from Dave and Brock

Were in the beautiful elegantly appointed foyer of a

suburban mini-mansions Clarice enters with The Reids from
the living room and we TRACK them as they move through

MR REID

CLARICE
We can try but I doubt they’1l

MRS REID

CLARICE
Right down to the warm earth tones

MRS REID
Im glad we have the same tastes

CLARICE
(smiles gratified)
Me too

MR REID
If you ask me it all sounds like
mumbo-jumbo

Mrs Reid rolls her eyes and shares a smile with Clarice

CLARICE
My husband said just about the same
thing when we were picking out our
home I think the term he used
was “load of bull”

MR REID
(chuckling)
Good man What line of work he in

Catching Clarice off guard She has to think how to answer

Mrs Reid

CLARICE
Oh he uh runs his own
building management firm

MR REID
Tell him I like the way he thinks

CLARICE
(averting his eyes)
I will

grabs her by the elbow and starts up the stairs

Come on Clarice I wanna see how
my chi flows in the master bedroom

And the two of them head upstairs Clarcie’s confident smile
returning And we’ll PRELAP the sound of a coach’s WHISTLE

EXT SWIM STADIUM - MOVING WITH A DIVING BODY - NIGHT

The lean young body belongs to 12-year-old BRYSON SAWYER and
he knifes into the water

WIDER ANGLE

And we now know we are watching a 50-meter freestyle race
between several adolescent boys in an Olympic-size pool in an
outdoor swim stadium with bleachers and stadium lights
lighting up the night sky

TRACKING ANGLE

Bryson hits the opposite wall a half-length behind the
leader but coming out of his flip turn he turns on the
afterburners and easily zooms into the lead He hits the
wall in first place a length ahead of the next best swimmer
And a mother’s shrill voice pierces the air

JULIE (0S)
Whoo-hoo Bryson You-da-man

ANOTHER ANGLE

As Bryson climbs out of the pool we can see he’s a good-
looking kid with an innocent face He looks up to see his
mother Julie Sawyer rushing over with a towel He looks
over at some of the other teenage swimmers whose mothers are
pulling similar stunts They all look completely humiliated

JULIE (CONTD)
Way to go Sweetheart You rock

BRYSON
Mom stop It’s embarrassing you
slobbering all over me like this

JULIE
Oh excuse me for gettin’ a little
worked up because my twelve-year-
old son just cleaned the clocks of
a pool full of high school

freshmen

JULIE (CONTD)
Buster you won’t ever be too big

Julie grabs his chin and forces him to look her in the eye

JULIE
And why is that

BRYSON
Can we do this later

JULIE
Nope Give it to me

He rolls his eyes then quietly gives her the response she
wants -- a routine they clearly have been through many times

BRYSON
Because it’s just you and me Mom

Her eyes glisten with love

JULIE
That’s right baby Just you and
me against the world

Their moment is interrupted by COACH SPINELLO a thick good-

looking man in his late-twenties

COACH SPINELLO
Hey Bryson nice heat Got any
idea what your time was

BRYSON
I don’t know Around twenty-three
seconds

COACH SPINELLO
Try twenty-one and nine-tenths

BRYSON
Whoa

COACH SPINELLO
Youre dang-right-whoa That’s a
high school varsity time bro

Bryson looks at his mother amazed She beams

JULIE
I’m not saying anything Coach
I’m supposed to keep my trap shut

COACH SPINELLO
(smiles then)
So how do you feel about adding the
relay on Saturday I want you to
swim the free-style leg with the
fourteen-year-olds

BRYSON
(as in “totally cool”)
That would be totally ridiculous

COACH SPINELLO
Ill take that as a “yes”
(turns to go then
remembers something)
Oh Mrs Sawyer

JULIE
Miss Sawyer

COACH SPINELLO
Sorry The team mom asked me to
remind you we still need your check
for the new club warm-up suits

JULIE
I’m sorry Completely slipped my
mind I’11 bring one Saturday

COACH SPINELLO
Sounds great

The coach bumps knuckles with Bryson and crosses off Bryson
gives Julie a probing look But she switches gears on him

JULIE
You know what I’m in the mood for
Burger Cabana

But as she busies herself with packing up his stuff he keeps
his eye on her That check thing bothers him

CUT TO

INT BROCK’S BMW - TRAVELING - NIGHT
They guys are chillin’ with Gatorade and the windows down as

they drive back from the Y in Brock’s sweet ride But Dave
is clearly still fuming about his run-in on the court

DAVE
I’ve known Darnell from knee-high
to a Pontiac I don’t know why he
has to do me like that

Brock looks at Dave and smiles knowingly They’ve had this
conversation before

BROCK
Seems pretty simple to me You
stole his college scholarship and
he’s still ticked off about it

DAVE
I didn’t steal nothing from nobody
The brother got caught dealin’
crack and lost his scholarship I
earned mine fair and square

BROCK
Still I know how he feels being
the better athlete and all

Dave gives him a look of disbelief

DAVE
Better athlete my ass Now you
the one smoking crack

Brock smiles Dave knows he’s been had

DAVE (CONTD)
Somehow it all got messed up Two
shorties knockin’ around the hood
dreamin’ about being Michael
Jordan One ends up a broke-ass
bail-jumper The other one ends up
gettin’ a piece of the pie

BROCK
Victim of his circumstances

DAVE

Shit that ain’t circumstances
that’s choices Circumstances is
tidal waves and hurricanes Choices
is “Should I or shouldn’t I sling
this crack”

(winking at Brock)
“Should I or shouldn’t I punch this
white Superstar in the nose”

BROCK
No circumstances is having no
father around to teach you how not
to smoke crack because the
government forgot to fix the levies
and a hurricane just flooded your
house You got to have boots to
have bootstraps brother

DAVE
Look at you all white and liberal
and trippin’ like you a member of
the Rainbow Coalition

Brock has to laugh about this

BROCK
I guess you’re right Life isn’t
fair Otherwise some butt-ugly
sucker like you doesn’t end up with
a fine lady like Clarice while a
rich handsome dude like me is till
trollin’ singles bars

Dave gets his chuckle on

DAVE
No you a troll ‘cause you afraid
of commitment

BROCK
True

DAVE
Besides I ain’t playing any
violins for you Vanilla Ice

(smile fades a little)
Married life ain’t all that anyway

Brock looks at him or a long moment
BROCK
What are you talking about You
guys are doing great right

Dave realizes he said that out loud pulls it back

DAVE
Yeah we good Things is good

Brock stews on that a beat decides to probe a little deeper

BROCK
How’s that other thing between you

DAVE
(avoiding his eyes)
It’s all good We working on it

But the look on Brock’s face says he isn’t buying it

EXT DOWNTOWN STREET - NIGHT - SAME TIME

And Brock’s BMW passes a beat-up looking late-model Nissan
Sentra going in the opposite direction

INT JULIE’S NISSAN - TRAVELING - NIGHT - SAME TIME

Were CLOSE ON the radio as some Big Hair Corporate Rock
song like “DUST IN THE WIND” is playing And we’ll WIDEN to
see that Julie is driving the car with Bryson sitting next to
her He notices how preoccupied she is

BRYSON

How come you’re not singing
JULIE

What
BRYSON

Usually I have to stick my head out
the window to drown out your voice
when this song is playing

Julie looks at him for a long moment hesitating

BRYSON (CONTD)
What’s wrong Mom You have to
tell me You were the one who made
up the “no secrets rule” after Dad
left Not me

JULIE
(sighs then)
Youre right Bry Look I don’t
want you to worry about this but
the HMO is cutting back my hours
But I already have some ideas for
how to make some more money

BRYSON
(without missing a beat)

Yeah it’s called basic math
(MORE)

BRYSON (CONTD)
If you make less you have to spend
less I’m gonna drop out of swim
club It’s too expensive

JULIE
Whoa we are not even going there
you understand me I’1l1 eat Cup O’
Noodles three times a day before
you miss one minute of swim club

Bryson tries not to let on that he’s relieved by this -- but
it’s clear that he is Something hopeful hits him

BRYSON
Maybe Dad will come through with
his child support
Julie almost goes with skepticism but thinks better of it

JULIE
Maybe he will

Which seems to lift his spirits

BRYSON

Cup O’ Noodles are pasta right
JULIE

Loosely
BRYSON

Good Coach Spinello says I need to
start carbo-loading before meets

Julie smiles at his pluck She loves this boy

CUT TO

INT JOHNSON HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT - LATER

A bedroom decorated out of the Pottery Barn catalog Dave
enters quietly and sees that Clarice is already in bed with
her back turned toward his side He quietly slips out of
sweats and climbs into bed cuddling up against her

DAVE
You awake baby

He kisses her shoulder trying to arouse her
DAVE (CONTD)
I got a big thing for you baby

and it gettin’ bigger by the
moment

She turns further away from him His face falls
CLOSER ANGLE

We see that she is indeed awake but in no mood to cooperate
And well HEAR the CRACK of a ball coming off a bat

DISSOLVE TO

EXT DOWNTOWN LITTLE LEAGUE FIELD - DAY - THE NEXT DAY

WE’RE CLOSE ON A BASEBALL as it is grounded hard across the
dirt toward a handsome honey-toned kid maybe 12 who is
playing second base on a rundown inner-city field more dirt
than grass The boy CARLOS gets into position to scoop it
up but the ball has eyes and squirts between his legs

WIDER ANGLE

“Coach” Dave is holding the bat and his assistant Brock is
shagging the balls at home plate and it’s clear that we are
in the middle of a Little League team practice The team is
a Fat Albert gang of various shapes and sizes some raggedy
some street-heartened Besides Carlos we’1ll come to know a
few of them as JAYLEN DARIUS MARCUS and DESHAWN Dave
calls out to Carlos slightly annoyed

DAVE
Carlos How many times I got to
tell you son Keep your hind end
down You gonna catch the ball on
your chin if you pokin’ at it like
it’s a bug

Which causes a round of SNICKERS from around the infield
Dave hits a pop fly which shortstop Deshawn has to race back
to catch When he snags it cleanly he begins strutting
around show-boating

DESHAWN
Who’s your daddy now suckers

CARLOS
Please Baby A-Rod stop actin’
like you meant to catch that ball
You luckier than a crackhead with
a five-dollar scratcher

More HOOTS HOWLS and AD LIB trash talk from the other boys
Dave and Brock trade a weary look

DAVE
All right bring it in

ANOTHER ANGLE

Some boys sprint in and gather around Dave and Brock others

drag in huffing and puffing All are jabbering

JAYLEN
Say coach when can I show you my
curve ball

DAVE
When you’re eighteen

JAYLEN
Why I got to wait that long

BROCK
‘Cause that’s when you’ll be an
adult and your mama can’t sue us
for you blowin’ out your arm

Generating some SNICKERS from some of the other boys

DESHAWN
Coach Cracker snapped your ass

JAYLEN
Shut up fool

Brock gives Dave a “let it go” look But it ain’t happening

DAVE

Deshawn are you feelin’ sick
DESHAWN

No coach
DAVE

Well you must be sick because you
got diarrhea of the mouth boy

Now Deshawn gets his dose of derisive CHUCKLES

DAVE (CONTD)

(putting arm around Brock)
I want to tell you all something
Coach Houseman here is my main man
He’s saved my butt more times than
I want to admit and if I had to go
to war he’s the only man in the
world I would trust to get my back

(beat then)
Deshawn what race am I

Deshawn looks a little confused Like it’s a trick question

DESHAWN
Black

DAVE
Wrong I’m human first then I’m
black There’s only one race of
people little brothers The human
race and there are two kinds of
people Good ones and bad ones

(a beat to Deshawn)
So D what race is Coach Houseman

DESHAWN
(happily thinks he has it)
White

Brock throws Dave a smile Dave gives a sigh

DAVE
Well have to work on that later
(blows his whistle)
All right Wind sprints

Which causes GROANS of protest from all over especially from
plump Marcus a pear-shaped boy with a tiny tiny head

DARIUS
Marcus can’t run He too fat

MARCUS
I ain’t fat My mama say I just
got big bones

DARIUS
Boy yo butt so fat if you farted
it would take ‘til next week to
come out

Huge LAUGHTER and lots of “skin” is slapped among the boys

DAVE
I like that Darius You been
playin’ the dozens haven’t you

DARIUS
Yeah Coach I keep it tight

DAVE
Well guess what You so pretty
if anybody beats you on one of
these sprints I’m gonna make you
wear a dress in Saturday’s game

Dave blows his WHISTLE and the other boys take off running
Darius’ cocky smile melts and he turns and joins the race
Brock turns to Brock and shakes his head

BROCK
Damn you’re good Way better than
my little league coach He used to
check our cups before every game
Your coach ever do that

DAVE
What do you mean “check”

BROCK
You know stick his hand down
there move it around a little
make sure it everything was good

DAVE
(long askance look)
No wonder you so messed up

Brock laughs at him He got him again But suddenly Dave’s
demeanor darkens Brock sees that Dave is looking off in the
distance and follows his eyes to

THEIR POV

Darnell is approaching with a couple of what in the inner-
city city could be described as a “ho’s” in painted on jeans
on his arm He is chugging from a forty-ounce malt liquor
and staring at us with red dead eyes

BACK TO SCENE

Dave stares back anger brewing in his eyes

BROCK
What’s Darnell doin’ here
DAVE
Come to watch Carlos play ball I

s’pose
Sparking a look of surprise from Brock as Darnell walks up

DAVE (CONTD)
Yall not welcome here with that
King Cobra brother

DARNELL
Shut up bitch I can come up in
this piece and see my boy anytime I
want

DAVE
Not drunk on your ass you can’t
It’s a bad influence on the boys
And it’s against league rules

(eyeing the “ho’s”)

Now get outta here with your
wannabe mack daddy entourage or
I’ll make it so you never see your
boy play ball

If looks could kill Dave would be a dead man Darnell hates
on him for a long moment then throws up his hands

DARNELL
Fuck it Whatever

One of Darnell’s ladies snaps her thong at Dave as if to say
“don’t you wish” then Darnell crosses off with them

BROCK
You never told me he was Carlos’
father

DAVE

He’s his daddy But that’s a long
way from bein’ his father

CUT TO

INT JOHNSON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY - LATER

We’re CLOSE ON A LADY’S SHOE rocking up and down It’s a
nice dress shoe Something an older woman might wear to
church And we’ll WIDEN to see Mama sitting on the sofa
dressed to the nines her arms and legs crossed impatiently
She’s a decade older but she hasn’t lost any of her spit

Clarice enters from the hallway leading to the master
bedroom adjusting her earrings She looks stunning dressed
in the kind of gown you don to win an award She looks at
her watch then goes to the window and looks out

CLARICE
Where is Dave He knew we had to
leave by five-thirty

MAMA
Honestly girl you need to keep a
shorter leash on that man

Clarice ignores this tries to change the subject

CLARICE
How do you like my new dress Mama

Clarice has a little too much décolletage showing for Mama’s
taste She crosses over and pinches her lapels together

MAMA
Lord have mercy girl are you
tryin’ to give the players a free
show We need a safety pin This
thing ain’t got buttons where a
Christian girl need buttons

Clarice brushes Mama’s hand away slightly annoyed

CLARICE
Mama would you stop

At that moment the front door opens and Dave walks in home
from practice looking all sweaty in his coaching clothes

DAVE
Hey baby I’m home What do you
say we go grab a bite to --

He freezes when he sees them both He’s clearly forgotten
something What that is suddenly dawns on him

DAVE (CONTD)
I’m just gonna need me a minute

Without waiting for the shoe to drop he hustles down the
hallway and into the bedroom Mama gives an exasperated sigh

MAMA
That man is steppin’ on my last
nerve

CUT TO

INT CLARICE’S CADILLAC - TRAVELING - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER

Dave is now in his nicest suit and putting pedal to the metal
as a frosty Clarice sits next to him while Mama stews in
back They come to a stop An ambulance lights and SIRENS
BLARING flies through the intersection in front of them
headed to some emergency But they don’t seem to notice

Dave tries to win back some brownie points as the light turns
green He gives her dress the once-over

DAVE
Damn Boo are you ready for the
red carpet or what And Mama
Clark may I say you are looking
like a fine Nubian Queen tonight

Clarice and Mama’s expressions don’t change

CLARICE
David you knew how important this
night was for me Do you realize
what an honor it is be the
Salesperson of the Year

DAVE
I know baby I’m sorry

CLARICE
And now we’re gonna be lucky if I
make my entrance before they start
servin’ the little egg rolls

DAVE
I didn’t mean to forget I just
got caught up with practice

Mama decides to break her silence

MAMA

What I know young man is you got
a priority problem You need a
priority transplant Why you
wastin’ your time with all those
little gangsters with their drawers
hangin’ all out All they are is a
bunch of thieves training to be
crackheads like their daddies

(beat then)
Ask me the only reason a black man
ever gets out the ghetto is because
a strong woman is there to keep his
ho-mongerin’ butt in line

DAVE
All due respect Mama not all
men are like your ex-husband

Which sends a chill through the car She glares at him
MAMA
Maybe not all But without your

granny and my daughter ridin’ herd
you sure woulda been

Dave is bristling Knows what he’d like to say but can’t
Clarice decides to offer an olive branch Sort of

CLARICE

All I know is if you put in as
much time on your business as you
do with those boys

(she touches his arm)
you might be able to get out
of the dungarees and look this fine
every day

As Dave drives them through the next intersection he turns
to accept her peace offering --

DAVE’S POV - OVER CLARICE

From out of nowhere a PICK UP TRUCK is barreling toward the
passenger side of their car

EXT DOWNTOWN INTERSECTION - HIGH ANGLE - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

The truck SLAMS into the Cadillac at full speed ina
sickening impact which feels like a nuclear shock-wave

INT CLARICE’S CADILLAC - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

And inside it’s instantly all grinding metal and flying
glass and everything goes into SURREAL SLOW-MOTION as Dave
sees the truck cave in Clarice’s side of the car and
everything begins spinning as Dave and Clarice’s heads
bounce into deployed air bags And things keep spinning for
a few more revolutions until the car suddenly jolts to a stop
and we return to REAL TIME

Dave looks over at Clarice and we PUSH IN on him Everything
FADES TO BLACK and goes DEATHLY SILENT and stays that way for
what seems like an eternity until we begin making out a
frail moaning weeping voice

MAMA (0OS)
Oh Sweet Jesus Oh Sweet Jesus
Lord have mercy

Suddenly we FADE BACK UP as Dave comes back to consciousness
and realizes what has just happened Mama is in the back
seat holding her head in her hands and still moaning after
Jesus He looks over at Clarice who is unconscious

DAVE
Reesie talk to me You okay
baby

No response He checks her pulse and listens to her chest

DAVE (CONTD)
That’s good you breathin’ strong
You keep breathin’ baby

Dave puts his hand on Mama’s shoulder She shaking Weak

DAVE (CONTD)
You all right Mama

MAMA
I think so

DAVE
I got to get us some help

Dave tries to open his door It’s jammed He puts his
shoulder into it This time it opens

EXT DOWNTOWN INTERSECTION - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

Dave staggers out of the car a little woosy and moves
around to the other side He’s got glass cuts all over his
face and a nasty bump emerging on his forehead In the bg
other cars are stopping and ONLOOKERS are rushing over

DAVE
(yelling out)
Please somebody call 9-1-1
Somebody get us some help

A MALE ONLOOKER crosses over just hanging up his cell phone

MALE ONLOOKER
It’s okay guy Help’s on the way

ANGLE ON PICK UP TRUCK

A ratty-looking TEENAGER who has so many facial piercing he
looks like he fell into a fishing tackle box emerges from a
smoking truck that has fared even worse than the Cadillac He
has bumps and scratches but appears not to be too badly
hurt He is dazed and confused as he paces back and forth

TEENAGER
I didn’t see the red I’m sorry
I’m sorry I was just reaching for
my cell phone
ANGLE BACK ON CADILLAC

By now other onlookers have made their way to the car

DAVE
My wife’s pinned in and my mother-
in-law’s still in the back

The first onlooker manages to yank open Mama’s back door

MALE ONLOOKER
Let me help you out ma’am

MAMA
(panicky)
No just get my Reesie out

Dave comes over to comfort her

DAVE
Mama we gonna get her out This
man gonna let you lie down in his
car until our ambulance comes

The man gives Dave a nod that says “absolutely” Reluctantly
Mama lets the man help her climb out of the car and escort
her slowly over to his car One of the other onlookers spots
something on the ground he doesn’t like

MALE ONLOOKER 2
You got fuel leaking

Dave looks at the leaking fuel His face fills with dread

INT CLARICE’S CADILLAC - NIGHT - SECONDS LATER

Dave slides back in the front seat next to Clarice She is
still out cold Dave looks and sees how wickedly pinned her
leg is by the twisted metal He gently pats her cheek

DAVE
Clarice baby can you hear me
Boo I need you to wake up

After a few beats her eyes flit open and she suddenly
realizes what’s going on She looks at her leg and her eyes
and voice fill with tears and panic

CLARICE
Jesus my side hurts so bad And
my leg I can’t feel my leg

DAVE
I know baby We gonna get you out
of here real soon

She claws at the door but it’s useless She begins sobbing

CLARICE
I’m so scared David I don’t
wanna die I don’t wanna die

Dave gets as good an angle on a hug as he can to comfort her

DAVE
Shhh baby I ain’t gonna let
nothin’ else happen to you

Dave and Mama try to follow them but a nurse stops them

DAVE
I got to go in there with her She
needs me

TRAUMA NURSE
Well take good care of her sir

She notices that Mama is looking very fatigued and examines a
nasty gash on the side of Dave’s head

TRAUMA NURSE (CONTD)
Besides you all could use a little
TLC yourselves

CUT TO

INT ALL SAINTS HOSPITAL - ER - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER

Were facing two emergency room beds partitioned by a
curtain On one side Dave is sitting with his shirt off
getting his head wound stitched up by an ER DOCTOR Dave
is clearly worried Next door Mama is reclining in the bed
wearing a hospital gown and a heart monitor

ANGLE ON DAVE’S BED

ER DOCTOR
(as he works on Dave)
How you doin’ over there Mrs
Clark

From the other side of the curtain comes the reply

MAMA (0S)

I told that other doctor -- some
Filipino or Chinese or some damn
thing -- I do not need these wires
hangin’ all up offa me I just
need to be with my baby girl

The Doctor trades a knowing look with Dave

ER DOCTOR
Just a precaution ma’am We just
need to monitor your heart a while
longer

Just then one of the Trauma Doctors we saw earlier enters and
crosses to Dave’s bed He’s wearing surgical scrubs and a
serious expression He relieves the ER Doctor

TRAUMA DOCTOR
Give me a moment Gerald

The ER Doctor takes his cue and crosses off

DAVE
(quickly alarmed)
What is it Doc What’s happenin’
with Clarice

TRAUMA DOCTOR
We’ve got her stabilized Mr
Johnson but we’ve got a long night
ahead of us

The curtain partition between the beds immediately draws back
and Mama is staring at them intently

MAMA
It’s already been a long night
What else you go to say

TRAUMA DOCTOR
Her leg is badly fractured But
what has me more concerned at the
moment is that she ruptured her
spleen which means she’s bleeding
internally As bad as the leg is
weve got to get in there and stop
that bleeding first

MAMA
Oh dear Jesus we need you

DAVE
(emotion welling up)
I don’t care what it takes or what
it costs you’ve got to fix her
Doc You got to fix her

The Doctor gives him an understanding nod and exits Dave
and Mama sit in silence for a long moment

MAMA
If we wasn’t in such a hurry
maybe this wouldn’t have happened

Mama lays back on her bed Dave doesn’t reply He can’t

Clarice’s bed in the wee hours of the morning

Clarice is in a post-op anesthetic twilight her leg is
elevated in a cast and in traction Behind Dave Mama is
SNORING softly in a recliner as the Trauma Doctor enters

checks the charts

TRAUMA DOCTOR
You got one tough cookie here Mr
Johnson Before she went under
she kept telling me I was not
allowed to remove any of her body
parts without her permission

DAVE
(smiling)
That’s my Reesie

TRAUMA DOCTOR
The tear in the spleen was small

enough to patch It should heal up

in a week or so But the leg’s
another matter

DAVE
How bad is it

TRAUMA DOCTOR

We had to put pins in three places
She’s not going to be able to bear

weight on it for a good a month

DAVE
She wont be happy to hear that

She’s gonna wanna get back to work

the moment she gets out of here

TRAUMA DOCTOR

Mr Johnson this is a very severe

injury If she doesn’t want to
have to park in the handicapped
spot the rest of her life she is
going to need months of
rehabilitation You need to make
her understand that

Dave sighs not looking forward to that assignment

DAVE
Maybe you could give me some of
them drugs you used to keep her
knocked out

The Trauma Doctor smiles and exits the room
at Mama Still catching sawing logs

Dave looks over

He leans over Clarice gently brushes her hair with his
fingers and whispers encouragement to her even though he
knows she can’t hear him

awhile but we gonna get you back

DAVE
She’s fine Reesie Crotchety as

CLARICE
Good Lord that better not be for

You know I just started with this

was in between jobs for awhile

JULIE
Stop banging every skirt you see

He glares at her for a long beat He then retrieves a

checkbook

from his desk drawer and begins to write a check

TED
I can only afford two-hundred right
now I’1ll try to send some more in
a few weeks

JULIE
(takes check from him)
Id say “thanks” but that’s usually
reserved for somebody who does
something for you without having
their arm twisted

She goes to the door and turns back

JULIE (CONTD)
You know Bryson is really coming
along with his swimming In fact
he has his first meet later today
(beat then)
It might be nice if he knew his dad
gave a damn

Guilt fills Ted’s eyes Julie opens the door to find an
insecure nosy Kate standing there eavesdropping Julie
gives her a condescending smile and then exits past her

Clarice’s room is now filled with flowers and Get Well gifts
Dave examines a card from one of the arrangements

DAVE
This one’s from Michelle
(reading)
“Roses are red violets are blue
Girl we holdin’ your big ass real
estate trophy so you better get
well soon”

But it’s a reminder of her loss and the reality of her
situation She looks away tears filling her eyes

DAVE (CONTD)
Don’t cry Reesie We gonna get
through this

CLARICE
(flashing on him)
We ain’t the one with the leg
twisted up like a damn pretzel

DAVE
Youre right baby

CLARICE
Why did this have to happen
Everything was swimmin’ along so
perfectly It was gonna be my big
night standin’ up there gettin’
that award showin’ the world that
I’ve arrived That I am somebody

DAVE
Baby don’t do that You been a
somebody to me since the first day
I met you You’re my somebody

She looks at Dave thinking about that and holds back from
saying what she really wants to say It’s not lost on Dave
A KNOCK at the door interrupts the moment They turn to see a
winsome black woman in her 40s CARMEN MCATEE wearing a
colorful African kaftan and her hair in dreads She’s a big
woman but all the equipment’s in the right proportions

CARMEN
Dave and Clarice I’m Carmen
McAtee from the counseling center
up at Emmanuel Fellowship

Clarice wipes her eyes throws on a smile as Carmen enters

CLARICE
Excuse my face I never got to put
on my war paint today

They all shake hands and AD LIB greetings

CARMEN
Bishop Wilkes asked me to come pay
you a visit

Dave and Clarice trade looks

CLARICE
Really Wasn’t that sweet of him
I’m surprised he heard about the
accident so soon

CARMEN
Well your mama was bendin’ his ear
all morning’ about it

DAVE

We haven’t really been comin’ to
church lately

CARMEN
Yeah she told him that too

Awkward moment for Dave and Clarice Not for Carmen

CARMEN (CONTD)
How is that leg feeling Looks
like one big item for the prayer
chain right there

CLARICE
Thanks but I’m sure there are
other people in the church in more
dire prayer need than me

CARMEN
Well we did have one young brother
from the gospel choir stick a
communion cup up his nose trying to
impress his girl but I think this
leg is still takin’ home first
prize this week

Clarice can’t hold back a smile over that image However

CLARICE
Please thank the Bishop for his
concern but we’re fine really
You must have other people you need
to visit

CARMEN
Nope Just you

To Clarice’s surprise Carmen pulls up a chair and smiles

CARMEN (CONT’D)
Why don’t we read some scripture
Do you have a favorite passage

As Carmen pulls out a bible Dave and Clarice exchange
flabbergasted looks

CARMEN (CONTD)
I’m feelin’ a little drowsy As
long as we can stay away from all
the begets and begats

DAVE
And anything dealin’ with locusts
and pillars of salt and shit
(catching himself)
Excuse me Lord

speaks volumes

PUSHY NURSE
Son what do you think this is

The little attempt at humor doesn’t really register with him

BRYSON
You think Dad’s gonna make it I
emailed him and left a message on

A white Hummer being driven by a blond lady yuppie comes
whipping around a corner and Julie has to take evasive action
to avoid it The lady gives Julie a look that says “what are

Can I help you

Julie looks at a little sheet of paper

JULIE
I hope I have the right address

JULIE

wry smile -- which gives him permission to chuckle

CUT TO

INT JOHNSON HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - DAY - MOMENTS LATER

Clarice sees her she does not try to cover her downcast
demeanor like we’ve seen her do before

DAVE
Reesie this is Julie Sawyer
She’s the physical therapist we
asked the hospital to send over

CLARICE
I didn’t ask them You did

Julie gives Dave a reassuring look Mama is watching her
like a hawk from the corner of the room Already doesn’t
like what she sees Julie sets down her gear and pulls up a
chair next to the bed

JULIE
Clarice after what you’ve been
through I know the last thing you
want is some stranger in your life
So let’s just start by talking

Clarice turns and eyes her knowingly

CLARICE
I ain’t looking for anyone to
psychoanalyze me either

JULIE
Good Because I’m not looking to
get sued for masquerading as a
psychologist either

Clarice’s affectation remains flat and Mama remains
skeptical But Dave has to smile a little on that one

JULIE (CONTD)
But talking about how you’re
feeling emotionally can help me
design a better plan for getting
you back up on that leg again

Clarice’s eyes fill with tears of frustration

CLARICE
You’re asking how I feel I feel
like damn Humpty-Dumpty sittin’ in
a million pieces at the bottom of
the wall In the last two weeks
my life has gone from top of the
world to complete shit That’s how
I feel

Mama’s not biting her tongue anymore She lasers in on Julie

MAMA
Okay Miss Sunshine that is about
all of this nonsense I’m gonna put
up with Can’t you see you makin’
things worse Time to scoot that
perky little behind outta here

A little depression is normal in
these cases She’s been through a
very traumatic experience Soon as
she sees she’s making progress
shell snap out of it I promise

DAVE
Thanks for being gentle with her

JULIE
Youre a good husband to want her
treated gently Mr Johnson

DAVE
Please call me Dave Mrs Sawyer
It doesn’t make me feel so old

Dave smiles and reciprocates with a warm handshake Julie

Watching from a rocking chair is Mama And as begin HEARING
a tune like Luther Vandross’ “HERE AND NOW” we can see that
Mama didn’t like that exchange one little bit

DISSOLVE TO

A MONTAGE OF SCENES
A) INT JOHNSON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

Another visit by Julie and this time she has Clarice
working with hand weights making rowing motions with her
arms keeping her from upper body atrophy

B) And yet another session with Clarice -- this time raising
and lowering her non-injured leg Hip work And we begin
HEARING Dave’s remembering voice again

DAVE (V0O)
Somethings always confused me
about the story of Adam and Eve
God made man first and gave him a
whole bunch of instructions Work

cultivate protect
(MORE)

DAVE (VO) (CONTD)
But God never gave Eve any
instructions Not one It all
fell on Adam

C) EXT DOWNTOWN LITTLE LEAGUE FIELD - DAY

Dave returns to his team and his boys greet him happily
crowding around him giving him “Bash Brother” high-fives
including one from Brock

D) Darnell watching the whole scene from inside his beat up
old Hooptie (station wagon) parked on the street next to the
field He takes a drag from a joint and drives on a park

DAVE (VO) (CONTD)
And ever since then a man has been
defined by the roles he performed
By how good he worked and
cultivated By how good he
protected his wife and children

E) INT JOHNSON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

As Dave is transferring Clarice from her wheelchair into
their bed he tries to give her a peck on the cheek but
she’s in a testy mood and wants no part of it

F) INT BROCK HOUSEMAN’S DOWNTOWN CONDO - NIGHT

Brock comes home from work to discover his phone blinking “13
Messages” He sighs and pushes the “Delete All” button

DAVE (VO) (CONTD)
The world has always wanted men to
be heroes But somewhere that all
changed I’m not sayin’ all the
changes were bad Lord knows
inequality no matter what kind
needs to stay dead and buried

G) EXT JOHNSON HOUSE - FRONT PORCH - DAY

Clarice is sitting in her wheelchair on the front porch
reading her “House Beautiful” magazine when Dave pulls up in
her beautifully repaired Cadillac Good as new

H) INT ALL SAINTS HOSPITAL - DOCTOR’S OFFICE - DAY
Dave holds Clarice’s hand as the Trauma Doctor we remember
from earlier cuts off her cast and removes the exterior rods

Clarice grimaces when she sees her wicked scars and how
withered her leg has gotten

DAVE (VO) (CONTD)
Women started bein’ their own
heroes Maybe because their men
forgot how to be or maybe because
they didn’t want to be protected
anymore

I) EXT DOWNTOWN SWIM STADIUM - POOL - DAY

At the swim stadium Bryson wins yet another race and his
swim club teammates all do a congratulatory pile on him when
he climbs out of the pool

J) INT JOHNSON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

Julie pays another PT visit Now the real work begins
Slowly painfully manipulating Clarice’s leg Mama is
hanging out nearby Can’t bear to watch

DAVE (VO) (CONTD)
When Clarice and I first married
she treated me like I was her Zulu
prince And I wanted nothing more
than to protect and cherish her
But when she started being the real
bread-winner that all began to
change

K) And now Clarice is sitting on an exercise bike slowly
pedaling Then faster Even faster

L) Clarice is in her wheelchair in the living room As Dave
and Mama watch Julie hands her a cane At first Clarice
doesn’t want to try it But Julie gives her an encouraging
“you can do it” smile Finally Clarice plants the cane in
front of her and pulls herself up into a standing position
She can’t believe it She’s up on her own two legs

DAVE (VO) (CONTD)
See when the world takes away a
man’s reasons for bein’ a man --
when he loses his self-identity
purpose passion and self-respect --
somehow things always go wrong
That’s one lesson my Granny never
prepared me for

Then she takes a step and a breaks into a broad victory
smile Even Mama has to smile about this And Dave gives
Julie a look of thanks as the SONG and our MONTAGE ENDS

Letter” to my boss telling him
youve never met a more skilled and
professional physical therapist

DAVE
(smiling)
Done

Julie opens her trunk and Dave stows her gear

JULIE
Second Clarice needs several more
weeks of therapy and I need the
cash so please don’t cut me off

DAVE
Wouldnt think of it

Julie climbs into her car Dave hovers at her door Julie
looks up at him and looks at him sincerely

JULIE
You know I’ve been doing this a
long time Most spouses bail by
about the third session You being
so supportive of Clarice is more
important to her progress than you
realize

DAVE
Maybe you could write Mama one of
them happy letters about me

She gets a giggle from this and looks at him appreciatively
JULIE
Well I gotta pick up my son See
ya Monday

She goes to turn her key A gruesome GRINDING NOISE comes
from her engine

JULIE (CONTD)
Shit
(catching herself)
Sorry My frigging battery is
always doing this

She tries the ignition again More GRINDING then a horrible
CLUNKING NOISE Dave raises his eyebrows

DAVE

How come the girl can’t call a tow
truck

DAVE
Because she’s gonna be late to pick
up her boy

MAMA

Maybe she shoulda thought of that
before comin’ over here in that
broke-ass car

Dave gives Clarice a look like “somebody’s about to be hurt”

CLARICE
Dave’s right Mama We can’t make
her late for her boy Besides
this girl has been here for us and
we can return the favor

Dave gives Clarice a kiss on the cheek which this time she
receives and heads for the door Mama feels slighted

At that moment they pass by a storefront business whose
ALARM BELL is ringing They don’t seem to notice Dave is
preoccupied with question he doesn’t quite know how to ask

DAVE
Look it ain’t none of my business
but how did you I mean what
happened to --

JULIE
How did I end up a single mother

Dave gives her an apologetic nod

JULIE (CONTD)
Believe me I wish the story was
more dramatic than it is Like I’m
widowed because my husband died on
Flight 93 or something Truth is
I’m just a middle-class cliche

DAVE
What do you mean
JULIE
Ted and I -- that’s my ex-husband --

were the perfect little yuppie
couple We met at SMU got married
after graduation got our careers
started saved up for a house and
then had Bryson

(beat sighing)
But then I found out Ted had this
disease called “Ashley Syndrome”

DAVE
Ashley Syndrome What’s that

JULIE
You get it from being attracted to
twenty-two-year-old pole dancers
named Ashley

DAVE
(suddenly getting it)
Oh Sorry Didn’t mean to pry

JULIE
It’s okay We’ve been divorced for
two years I used to chop up
cucumbers every night and think of

BRYSON
Oh yeah No offense sir

DAVE

offered to give us a lift home

Bryson opens the back door and slides in Bryson checks out
the leather seats as Dave pulls back onto the boulevard

BRYSON (CONTD)
Dude this is a nice ride

DAVE
Thanks You shoulda seen it six

BRYSON

instead of that crappy Sentra

Dave trades a smile with Julie

DAVE
So your mom says you like King Kong
up in that pool

BRYSON
Mom should stop talking so much

JULIE
Excuse me

BRYSON
She thinks I’m gonna e like some
Olympic gold medalists someday and
I’ll get all this endorsement money
and then she can mooch off me

JULIE
It could happen

DAVE
See now I’m the wrong man to talk
swimmin’ Only freestyle I know

about is rappers spittin’ rhymes on
a street corner But you stick a
basketball or a baseball in my hand
I got the skills to pay the bills

Somehow this has touched a nerve in Bryson Julie notices

BRYSON
I’ve only played baseball once My
dad took me to the park to play
catch a couple years ago

Dave looks at Bryson in rear-view mirror The kid is looking
out the window Julie gives Dave a “sorry about that” look

DAVE
Tell you what I got this Little
League team I coach Any time your
mom wants to bring you by I can
hook you up with a few pointers

BRYSON
(brightening)
That would be totally ridiculous

Dave looks at him a little confused

JULIE
It means “cool”

DAVE
We practice over at Eastside Field
So you might stand out a little

if you know what I’m sayin’

DAVE
See now the way it works is the
man’s s’posed to carry the bags

JULIE
Except when the woman needs to show
she isn’t totally pathetic

DAVE

After a long beat she relents Hands him the gear
TRACKING ANGLE TO FRONT PORCH

Look I know a guy who runs a
repair shop Why don’t you let me
get him to take a look

JULIE

That’s really sweet but I can’t
really afford a big repair bill --

DAVE
Trust me This guy owes me
(offering his hand)
And Clarice and I owe you

After a long beat she shakes on it reluctantly

JULIE
Thank you I mean it

It’s awkward for a beat She leans in and gives hima
grateful kiss on the cheek then enters and closes her door
Dave stands there for a moment feeling strangely exhilarated

With a little grease still on his face Dave is at Julie’s
front door He places Julie’s car keys in a mailbox hanging
near the door And tucks a note in the screen door

TRACKING ANGLE TO CAR

Dave crosses back to the street where Brock’s Beamer is
waiting with the engine running As he does we now see that
Julie’s Sentra is parked in her driveway

INT BROCK’S BEAMER - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

Dave opens the door and slides in next to Brock who is
dressed in what looks like pajamas and a tee-shirt

BROCK
That must be one special physical
therapist to interrupt my beauty
sleep like this

DAVE
She is

BROCK
You think she’s seein’ anyone

DAVE
Just drive fool

Brock shrugs it off with a smile and guns the accelerator

EXT JULIE AND BRYSON’S BUNGLAOW - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

The porch light comes on and the door opens Julie finds the
note just as the Beamer is driving off Confused she opens
the note and we read it with her over her shoulder

DAVE (V0O)
Julie I didn’t want to wake you
All you needed was a new solenoid
so I was able to fix it myself
Hope it won’t give you any trouble
for awhile Blessings Dave

As she watches the Beamer disappear around a corner Julie
gives a stunned smile that just says “wow” And we’1ll HEAR
the sound of church BELLS RINGING

DISSOLVE TO

INT EMMANUEL FELLOWSHIP CHURCH - SANCTUARY - DAY

The service has not yet begun but the pews are filling up as
Bishop Wilkes -- looking a little older and wiser than when
we last saw him -- is down front greeting his parishioners

ANOTHER ANGLE

Clarice looks stunning in her best church dress and hat as
she slowly enters with the aid her cane Dave in his best
suit is at her side Mama also looking lovely follows
behind AD LIBBING greetings with acquaintances like a mother
hen Michelle already there with her handsome husband TODD
stands up in her pew and gasps when she sees Clarice walking

MICHELLE
Lord Jesus I’m having a vision

She rushes over and embraces Clarice and they both have to
work hard to hold back their tears

CLARICE
Hi sister girl

MICHELLE
Look at you Walkin’ like Black
Miss America down the runway to get
your crown We need some praise
Jesus music up in this place

Bishop Wilkes crosses over to Dave who is standing back from
the happy reunion Greets him with a warm handshake

BISHOP WILKES
Wonderful to see you in church
Dave Sister Wilkes and I been
prayin’ for you every day

DAVE
I know Mama Clark been givin’ you
the four-one-one since the
accident

BISHOP WILKES
Oh yes But we haven’t just been
prayin’ since the accident I been
prayin’ for you since the day I
married you and Clarice

(winking at them)

Anybody I tie the knot for gets on
my special list

Which takes Dave aback Bishop notices the pain in his eyes

BISHOP
I hope you know we’re always here
for you Twenty-four-seven If
Gods family is only for Sundays
then we a pretty flimsy family

DAVE
(thinking about this)
That’s straight Bishop Thanks
Dave watches as the Bishop crosses off and we begin HEARING
a kicking Gospel tune perhaps something like Kirk Franklin’s
“BLESSING IN THE STORM” which will carry us through
SERIES OF MOS SHOTS

A) A vibrant church choir in their colorful robes in all
their wonderful glory singing the song we’re hearing

B) A young girl singing a solo in the middle of the number

C) Michelle and Todd lifting their hands in praise as the
song continues

D) Bishop Wilkes preaching the word with authority He wipes
his brow and his tears as he preaches That’s what happens
when the Holy Ghost comes over a prophet

E) Mama speaks back the Bishop as he makes a point she likes

F) Clarice looks up at the cross at the front of the church
Being in church does her heart good

F) Dave staring straight ahead thinking Distracted
And as the SONG CONCLUDES well

DISSOLVE TO

EXT EMMANUEL FELLOWSHIP CHURCH - DAY - LATER

As services are letting out Dave escorts Clarice and Mama
into the sunshine where they AD LIB well wishes with several
parishioners Colorful eccentric Carmen McAtee spots them
and crosses over excitedly

CARMEN
My Lord can I get a witness over
here Look at you Clarice It’s
good to see you in church sister

CLARICE
Hi Carmen Nice to see you too

As Carmen engages Clarice we’ll ADJUST to FIND Dave He
turns and spots something that gets his attention

DAVE’S POV

A Caucasian WOMAN with her back turned to us From this
angle her curvy build and hairstyle look exactly like
somebody we’ve seen before She’s just cleaned up in a
Sunday dress and high-heels

BACK TO SCENE

A smile grows on Dave’s face He can’t believe it He taps
the woman on the shoulder

DAVE
Julie

The woman spins around It’s not Julie -- not even close
In fact she’s a little ugly for somebody so shapely

WOMAN
Excuse me

DAVE
(surprised disappointed)
Sorry I thought you were
somebody else

Looking for a quick escape Dave sees Michelle’s husband
Todd and takes the opportunity to get real friendly ADJUST
to find Clarice and Mama Dave’s little faux pas hasn’t been
lost on them They trade a look before Clarice puts on a
smile for another well-wisher who has come over to greet her

CUT TO

INT JOHNSON HOUSE - KITCHEN - LATER

Mama has prepared one of her traditional Sunday Dinners with
all the fixings -- turkey stuffing and sweet potato pie
Only there’s not much talk going on as they eat in silence

CLARICE
That was some real “soul food” we
got in church today We need to
start goin’ more often

But Dave hasn’t really heard her His mind is elsewhere

DAVE
Pass them Butter Beans baby

Clarice silently pushes the bowl of beans his direction She
can feel Mama’s eyes on her but chooses not to look

CUT TO

INT JOHNSON HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

That evening Dave is brushing his teeth while Clarice is
rubbing the scars on her leg with some Vitamin E cream

Clarice takes a deep breath for the courage to say something
that has been on her mind

CLARICE
This scares me David

DAVE
What scares you

CLARICE
This The silence between us
It’s like we’re a couple of ghosts
floating around this place

DAVE
I don’t like it either

CLARICE
I know I been really distant with
you since the accident It’s just
I didn’t know how to deal with what
I was feelin’ There were some
days I wished I could just stay
asleep and never wake up

DAVE
I know

CLARICE
But what scares me even more than
that is you pullin’ away from me

Their eyes meet for a long moment Dave doesn’t know what to
say And his lack of a response speaks volumes to Clarice

CLARICE (CONTD)
I want to talk to someone about it

DAVE
You mean like a counselor

CLARICE
Would you do that for me For us

Dave sits next to her on the bed and pulls her into his arms

DAVE
Sure baby

CLARICE
I just want us to go back to the
way it was before the accident
Before it all got messed up

But as Dave continues to hold her the doubt in his eyes says
things have been messed up for a lot longer than she thinks

DISSOLVE TO

INT EMMANUEL FELLOWSHIP CHURCH - COUNSELING OFFICE - DAY

Well CLOSE ON a painting which depicts a rather-dark

complexioned Jesus and then we’ll PAN ACROSS several framed
diplomas with a lot of “PHD” this and “MARRIAGE and FAMILY”
that and all bearing a name “CARMEN MCATEE” And then we’1l
FIND a very uncomfortable Dave and Clarice sitting on a
leather couch across from Carmen She has a clipboard on her
lap and is wearing an especially colorful lady’s dashiki

CARMEN
I want to give both of you some
love for having the courage to come
in today It means you want to
make your marriage work And
frankly that isn’t easy these days

Dave and Clarice both nod awkwardly

CARMEN (CONTD)
Clarice let’s start with you Why
don’t you give your view of what’s
going on in your relationship

CLARICE

Well since the accident I know
I’ve been depressed and we haven’t
talked very much It just seems
like our whole marriage Dave was
always Johnny on the spot with me
But lately he seems distracted
like he’s somewhere else

Dave just stares at her Can’t believe what he’s hearing

DAVE
How can you say that I been by
your side through this whole thing

CLARICE
I’m not talking about physically
I’m talking about emotionally

DAVE
Well maybe somebody’s gettin’ in
the way of that

CARMEN
What do you mean by that Dave

Dave glances at Clarice and she flashes him a “don’t go
there” look Dave pulls back

DAVE
Never mind

This little exchange wasn’t lost on Carmen

CARMEN
You know this works better if
we’re all honest with each another

Dave looks at Clarice This time she doesn’t meet his eyes

DAVE
It’s her Mama She been livin’
with us since Clarice got out the
hospital If I’m “somewhere else”
maybe it’s ‘cause I’m trying to get
away from her bein’ all up in my
grill about everything

CLARICE
That’s not true

DAVE
Yes it is Boo No matter what I
do I can’t please the woman And
it ain’t just since this accident
It’s been our whole marriage

CLARICE
Well maybe we should talk about
why Mama is displeased Like your
lack of discipline when it comes to
takin’ care of business with your
building maintenance company

DAVE
It ain’t no building maintenance
company Don’t make it out like
it’s better than it is I’ma
glorified janitor If I’m always
buggin’ over it it’s ‘cause I hate
every damn minute of it

CARMEN
Dave if you hate it so much why
keep doing it

DAVE
Ask her

Clarice looks at Carmen hoping she’1ll be an ally in this

CLARICE
He was a high school coach making
twenty-six-thousand dollars a year
If we were ever gonna be able to
move up in the world he needed to
be more ambitious So we had him
start his own company

CARMEN
Who is we

CLARICE
Us Him and me

Dave just rolls his eyes on that one

CLARICE (CONTD)
Unless you Shaquille O’Neal there
ain’t room for fun and games for a
black man A black man has to work
ten times harder just to get to the
starting line

DAVE
Even if it means havin’ to give up
what you love

CLARICE
Yes Where were you goin’ with it
David You were a junior varsity
coach for ten years I’m sorry to
say this baby but ain’t nobody at
the UT was blowin’ up your phone
to come coach the Longhorns

This one hurts Dave looks away from her ashamed

CARMEN
Dave what was it you loved best
about coaching

DAVE
(fighting his emotions)
Bein’ with them boys Helpin’ them
get past the curveballs life was
throwin’ at ‘em Helpin’ them
believe they could be somebody

CARMEN
You mean kind of like what a daddy
is supposed to do with a son

Dave looks up at her sharply A light comes on for him

DAVE
Yeah just like that

But now Clarice is rolling her eyes

CLARICE
Oh please Let’s not drag out
that tired old topic

CARMEN
What topic is that

Clarice seems frozen by the question

DAVE
Go ahead Say it Clarice

Another long beat before it all comes gushing out

CLARICE
Fine You wanna talk about it I
know exactly what you after Every
time you put your hands on me I
know what you want You want
babies Family

DAVE
What’s wrong with that

CLARICE
Because we been over it a million
times It’s not what I want I’m
not ready to give up all the places

I wanna go in life
(MORE )

CLARICE (CONTD)
Besides look at us trying to keep
our marriage together You think a
baby’s gonna solve our problems

Dave looks at her for a wounded moment

DAVE
I used to But now I don’t know

This is tough thing for Clarice to hear

CARMEN
Okay I know this is painful but
I think we’re getting somewhere

But both Dave and Clarice’s faces say they are not so sure

CUT TO

INT CLARICE’S CADILLAC - TRAVELING - DAY

Dave and Clarice ride along in their own raw spaces not
saying anything Some NEWSTALK SHOW playing on the radio
is suddenly interrupted by a long TONE and then

ANNOUNCER (OVER RADIO)

alert system This is only a test
If this had been an actual
emergency an official message

afraid to let him come to practice

He calls out to Jaylen in the outfield
DAVE (CONTD)

ANOTHER ANGLE
As Julie and Bryson arrive at home plate

JULIE
Hi Dave I hope you don’t mind
but he wouldn’t take “maybe next”
week for an answer

DAVE
No that’s cool That’s great
Bryson glad you could make it

Brock quickly bumps past Dave offering his hand

BROCK
You must be Julie Dave and
Clarice talk about you all the
time I’m Brock assistant coach

JULIE
(blankly)
No sorry But nice to meet you

MARCUS
Yo coach Who’s the little soda
cracker

Dave offers Julie an apologetic look then calls to the boys

DAVE

be workin’ out with us today

BRYSON

What’s crackin’ yall
VARIOUS REACTIONS
Around the diamond -- from stunned to skeptical to jaws
hanging open
EXT DOWNTOWN LITTLE LEAGUE FIELD - DAY - LATER

Bryson is now standing at second base wearing a glove
looking ready for action but unsure of what to do

DAVE
All right Bryson I’m gonna hit
you a ground ball and then you go
to first with it

BRYSON
Gotcha Coach

Dave hits a roller to Bryson Dave hits it so softly it
dies on the dirt about five feet in front of him Bryson
walks over picks it up and tosses it to the first baseman

DAVE
Good pick up Bryson Way to read
the ball

Bryson looks a little disappointed and some of the boys are
snickering in their gloves

DESHAWN
Yo Coach what is this Tee-ball
My ‘lil sister could have made that
play and she blind in one eye

Which ignites a round of CACKLES across the diamond Dave
promptly hits a scorching line-drive at Deshawn which he has
to duck in order to avoid getting his taken off
DAVE
Maybe we should try out your ‘lil
sister at shortstop
Deshawn gives Dave a worried look then turns to Bryson

DESHAWN
Nice play little white dude

ANGLE ON STANDS
Julie is watching and her concern turns into a smile
BACK TO SCENE

DAVE
Okay Bryson infield fly

Dave hits a tall pop fly out to second base As Bryson tries
to get a read on it he moves one way then another then
turns in a circle trying to keep his eye on the ball

Finally he sticks up his glove and the ball falls right on --
HIS HEAD It dazes him momentarily but he recovers quickly

BRYSON
I’m okay I’m okay
(looking around confused)
Are there like millions of gnats
flying around my head

Dave and Brock exchange concerned looks

DAVE
Hustle in here Coach Brock gonna
break open the ice pack

EXT DOWNTOWN LITTLE LEAGUE FIELD - DAY - EVEN LATER

Bryson is in the on-deck circle with a bat in his hand Brock
has just finished throwing batting practice to Darius Dave
plops a batting helmet down on his Bryson’s head smiling

DAVE

Bryson reciprocates with a smile

Bryson step in the batter’s box Out in the field lots of
AD LIB CHATTER and RAZZING from the players “Hey batter-
batter-batter” with “Yo Twinkle Toes” in there somewhere

BROCK
Here we go Bryson Nothing fancy

Brock winds up and fires the ball to the catcher Marcus
Bryson doesn’t even get the bat off his shoulder causing a
chorus of BOOS from the field Jaylen calls from second base

JAYLEN
What you waitin’ for batter An
invitation in the mail

BRYSON
I thought it was outside

MARCUS
Boy that was so down the middle
Amtrak coulda sold seats on it

Brock winds up and fires in another pitch This time it is
outside and Bryson swings right through it

MARCUS (CONTD)
Now that was outside

DARIUS
Yo Twinkle Toes where coach find

ANGLE ON STANDS
Now Julie is concerned and biting her nails nervously
BACK TO SCENE
This time Brock does the reprimanding glaring at Darius
BROCK
Hey Darius wasn’t that you who
missed the cutoff throw Saturday
and threw the ball into the stands
I’ll bet that old lady still has a
bump on her forehead

Now Darius is the target of derision and trash talk like
“Oh boy he tagged you straight up” etc

DAVE
Let’s go Bryson you can do this
Focus on the ball like it’s the
finish line in that pool

Bryson gives him a nod steps back into the box Brock steps
onto on the mound winds up and we’ll go into SLOW-MOTION as

offers his hand to very white Bryson

MARCUS

A moment that makes Dave and Brock very proud

EXT DOWNTOWN LITTLE LEAGUE FIELD - DAY - SOMETIME LATER

Practice is over In the dugout several of the players are
chatting quietly with Bryson He’s the man And we’ll
ADJUST to FIND Dave and Brock stowing equipment near home
plate as Julie crosses to them

JULIE
I can’t tell you both how much this
meant to him today
(looking at Dave)
And to me

A look not lost on Dave Brock looks up at the sky sighs

BROCK
You know Julie it’s starting to
get dark and this isn’t the safest
neighborhood Why don’t you let me
walk you and Bryson to your car

JULIE
Uh sure okay
(looking again at Dave)
Thanks again Dave

DAVE
(long beat meaning it)
My pleasure

BROCK
Julie I was thinking if you
ever need to reach us

As Brock leads Julie away he hands her a business card

BROCK (CONTD)
in case Bryson wants to come to
practice again Or if you ever just
want to talk about you know

a ring on my cell phone

As Dave watches them go shaking his head Brock turns and
gives him a really annoying wink

His back is covered with oil and now petite yet strong
WHITE FEMALE HANDS begin running down his naked back in a
suggestive (but shot very discreet) way Her fingers linger
at his towel line teasingly We catch a glimpse of a short

(saving best for last)
And check this The Reids made an
offer through another agent and it
fell out of escrow

But Clarice doesn’t react Michelle looks puzzled She
pulls up a chair and locks in her girlfriend radar

MICHELLE (CONTD)
Okay girl where is your head at

Clarice turns and looks at her blankly

CLARICE
I’m sorry

I just told you the Reids are still

It’s nothing I’m fine

No It was me who was tappin’

CLARICE
I had no idea Michelle

MICHELLE

Ain’t somethin’ a sister wants in
the church bulletin The reason
I’m tellin’ you to hang onto your
marriage no matter what is because
that’s what my man did for me I
was out gettin’ my freak on and he
could have kicked me to the curb

(hangs head tears coming)
But he didn’t He prayed that God
would fill the need I had in me
that was causing me to stray He
prayed for his prodigal wife to
come home And for the forgiveness
he would need if I ever did

CLARICE
And did he Did he forgive you

MICHELLE
It was hard It took a long time
But that’s a secret about how God
works He makes possible what the
world says is impossible My
husband didn’t give up on me and I
don’t ever want to sacrifice his
heart like that again

what Todd did

INT DAVE’S PANEL VAN - DAY

Dave is parked on the street out front of the Downtown
Aquatics Club He watches as families enter the stadium
He sighs and starts his engine but changes his mind turns
off the key He screws up his courage and opens his door

CUT TO

EXT SWIM STADIUM - DAY - MOMENTS LATER

Electricity in the air Packed bleachers Bryson comes
out of the locker room in his brightly colored warm-ups and
makes his way over to wear Julie and some of the other
parents are waiting with his teammates

JULIE
Babe you sure you’re not taking on
too much swimming five events

BRYSON
It’s regionals Coach needs me

Julie pulls him in for a hug and a hair-tousle

DAVE (0S)
Hope you don’t mind a little extra
pressure

Julie and Bryson spin to see Dave standing there

BRYSON
No way Coach you made it

DAVE
You swimmin’ for the gold young
man I wouldn’t miss it
Now the color drains from Bryson’s face replaced by dread
BRYSON
I’m not feeling so good Excuse
me I don’t wanna hurl on you
He rushes off to the locker room Dave looks concerned
JULIE
(not to worry)
He does that all the time

DISSOLVE TO

EXT SWIM STADIUM - BLEACHERS - DAY - LATER

Dave and Julie are sitting together in the packed stands We
HEAR the DRONE of an AIRPLANE overhead

OUR POV

A single-engine plane trailing an advertising banner reading
“THE GREATEST TRAGEDY IS INDIFFERENCE THE RED CROSS”

BACK TO SCENE
But Dave and Julie are too engrossed in the meet to notice

ANNOUNCER (OVER PA)
Fifty freestyle Heat seven
Swimmers to the blocks

They watch excitedly as Bryson makes his way to his lane
Dave yells out his support

DAVE
Yo Bryson remember you King King
up in this pool

Some of the parents around them stare at Dave annoyed He
may be a little over the top but Julie appreciates it

JULIE
You know his father has never once
seen him swim

DAVE
His father’s a stupid man

JULIE
I’m afraid Bryson wont be able to
look you in the eye if he doesn’t
place in this race

DAVE
Please this boy does not need to
impress me He’s already a
champion just bein’ here

JULIE
I know that But try convincing
him

And the sound of the STARTER GUN will take us into

SERIES OF SHOTS

A) We’re UNDER WATER as Bryson hits the pool and we’ll track
his progress from this angle for several strokes

B) And now we’re at the edge of the pool looking across all
eight lanes and watching the swimmers Bryson and another
boy are just a nose ahead of the pack

C) Dave and Julie are watching breathless as parents all
around CHEERING and SCREAMING

D) UNDER WATER Bryson hits the turn wall one stroke behind
the leader and a few strokes ahead of the next best swimmer
Bryson’s flip turn is perfect

E) Now we’re half way back to the finish line and Bryson
begins to turn on the afterburners He catches the leader

F) CLOSE ON FROM ABOVE Bryson and the leader Nose and nose

G) Dave is now cheering with the rest of the parents but
Julie has her eyes closed Can’t bear to watch

spontaneously before pulling apart looking slightly awkward

ANGLE BY POOL
A proud Coach Spinello is already wrapping Bryson in a towel

COACH SPINELLO
You got these high school boys
looking over their shoulders No
mercy right Kiddo

BRYSON
No mercy

Julie and Dave rush up Coach looks at Julie dead serious
COACH SPINELLO

The coach

JULIE

crosses off Dave pulls Bryson into a bear hug

DAVE
Now that’s what I’m talkin’ about
Boy you were off the chain

BRYSON
Thanks Coach But I still got
four more races this afternoon

DAVE
First call me “Dave” I ain’t the
coach today You the coach
(holding his chest)
And if you expect me to sit through
four more races like that I’m
gonna need me some heart pills

beaming So is Julie

BRYSON
Mom coach says I need to carbo-
load before my next heat Can Dave
go with us to Grazianos

JULIE
Honey I’m sure Dave’s has a busy --

her off with a hand on her shoulder

DAVE
Id love to go
(puts arm around Bryson)
All the carbs you can eat My
treat

CUT TO

INT DOWNTOWN PIZZA PARLOR - DAY - LATER

We’re TIGHT ON some nd video game Lots of BEEPS and
BELLS and WIDEN to see Bryson and a few of the other

swimmers i
of machine

n their warm ups dropping quarters in a wall full
s in a pizza joint with a family atmosphere

ANGLE ON TABLE

Dave and Julie are chatting freely picking at the last

slivers of

a pizza together in a quiet booth

JULIE
So if you loved being a high school
coach so much why did you quit

Dave looks at her for a long moment

DAVE
You the second person who’s asked
me that this week and I don’t have
a good answer

JULIE
Well if you ask me life is too
short not to follow your bliss

DAVE
My what

JULIE
Bliss Your thing Your passion
The one thing you do better than
anything else I’ve always
believed you should do what you
love and not worry about the
money If you do what you were
born to do the money will take
care of itself

(remembering something)
Course that hasn’t exactly panned
out with this cheap-frigging-HMO I
work for but you get my point

Dave has to chuckle at this She gazes at him long moment

JULIE (CONTD)
Dave I hope you won’t take this
the wrong way but as a single
woman I’m sort of an expert

DAVE
On what

JULIE

Good men The “’Til Death Do Us
Part” type The protect and
cherish type Me and my single
friends sit around bitching about
how all the guys like you are
already taken

(sighing sadly)
Clarice is a lucky woman She has
no idea how hard it is find a man
like you

Dave thinks a beat then ventures into taboo territory

DAVE
Sometimes I wish I wasn’t taken

Julie looks at him for a long moment

JULIE
What are you saying
DAVE
I’m not sure But I need to find

out

They look into each other’s eyes and the implications hang in
the air A door CHIME RINGING draws their attention to

ANGLE ON FRONT DOOR

Brock just entering in his best Saturday casual As he
crosses into the restaurant he does a double-take when he
sees Dave and Julie looking at him from a private booth

BACK TO SCENE

Dave hangs his head The moment is over Brock walks up to
their table surprised confused

BROCK
Dave what are you doing here

DAVE
I could ask you the same thing

BROCK
I live across the street

Oh right Dave and Julie trade awkward looks Julie jumps
up trying to put her best cover on things

JULIE
Nice to see you again Brock
Bryson invited Dave to his meet
Team ordered too many pizzas and we
needed an extra stomach

BROCK
Oh Cool

JULIE
I’m gonna go check on the boys
Dave thanks again for coming It
was really great of you

She offers her hand and he receives it It all looks very
harmless but their touch lingers for longer than it should
Then Julie crosses off Brock eyes Dave suspiciously

BROCK
You wanna tell me what the hell’s
goin’ on here brother

Dave doesn’t like his tone but doesn’t want to play games

DAVE
Don’t get all self-righteous with
me Not with the way you was
droolin’ all over her at practice
the other day

BROCK
Hey time out That’s not the
point I get to drool all I want
I’m not the one who’s married

DAVE
What are you -- my mama

BROCK
(beat that hurt)
No I’m the guy who’s supposed to
have my best friend’s back and I
don’t want to see him do something
stupid and screw up his life

But Dave is numb even to this

DAVE
My life’s already screwed up I
appreciate your concern but I
don’t want your advice on this

As Dave crosses off Brock watches him sadly wounded
TRACKING ANGLE
FOLLOW Dave over to Julie and Bryson at the video games
BRYSON
Hey Dave you want to get your
brains blown out in Neo Geo
DAVE
(chuckling)
I’ll have to pass on that And I’m

gonna need a raincheck on the rest
of your races this afternoon

BRYSON
How come

DAVE
(looking at Julie)
I got me some stuff to work out

BRYSON
That’s cool How about next week
I got an AAU meet I’11 bring my
gold from today to show you

DAVE
Id like that son

Dave ruffles his hair He gives Julie one last look before
exiting

CUT TO

INT JOHNSON HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - DAY

Dave enters somberly The curtains are drawn shut and the
only light comes from lit several candles Dave lays his

cell phone on the nightstand then sits on the edge of his
bed and puts his head in his hands

CLARICE (0S)
You didn’t notice the candles

Dave looks up to see Clarice in sexy nothing of a nighty
poised on her cane near her vanity Dave is not only

surprised to see her -- but surprised to see her like this
DAVE
Reesie
CLARICE

(best come-hither voice)
Remember the candles when we first
got married They were always my
signal “Green light baby I’m
gonna whip somethin’ on you”

Clarice begins to limp slowly toward Dave with her cane her
wicked scars more visible than ever on her bare leg Dave
looks at her deeply conflicted

DAVE
Are you sure you wanna do this

She gingerly climbs on the bed and begins rubbing his
shoulders

CLARICE
I sent Mama on an errand We need
this I think it’s why we arguin’
so much We need to get back to
the lovin’ part of our marriage

DAVE
What about your leg

CLARICE
Ill be careful

She begins to kiss him on the neck But he doesn’t respond

She tries

She pulls

CLARICE (CONTD)
Oh baby I want you so much

to nibble on his ear This time he stops her

DAVE
Reesie you don’t have to do this

back on the bed wounded desperate paranoid

CLARICE
It’s my scars Ill put some make
up on ‘em so you don’t have to look
at ‘em

DAVE
It’s not your scars

Now her hurt turns to betrayal and explosive rage

CLARICE
It’s because you having an affair
isn’t it you bastard

DAVE
What

CLARICE
With Julie Sawyer

DAVE
That ain’t true

CLARICE
You think I haven’t noticed the
little phone calls The way you
look for her in a crowd The way
you light up when she’s around
What is the truth if you ain’t
hittin’ it with that woman

Dave looks at her with a mix of confusion guilt in his eyes
She’s not wrong After a long moment he sighs

DAVE
It ain’t gone as far as an affair
But I can’t lie to you Things
ain’t been right for us in a long
time and I do feel somethin’ for
this girl For Julie

Big tears of resignation form in Clarice’s eyes and she
covers herself with the bedding -- as if ashamed of her body

CLARICE
It’s worse than affair She’s taken
your heart from me and that ain’t
somethin’ I can do anything about

Neither of them says anything for a long time

CLARICE (CONTD)
Are we over David

DAVE
(eyes welling up)
I don’t know Reesie
I gotta do some thinking

Dave turns and exits quietly Clarice falls back into her
pillow sobbing And we’ll FIND his cell phone resting on
the night stand and begin HEARING a soulful RandB tune (perhaps
something like Luther Vandross’ “I WHO HAVE NOTHING”)
INTERCUT

MONTAGE OF MOS SCENES

INT DOWNTOWN GYMNASIUM - DAY

Dave returns to the empty gym and begins shooting hoops all
by himself And he pushes himself really hard

EXT SWIM STADIUM - DAY

Bryson steps up to the blocks for his final heat as Julie

looks on proudly in the bg And we’ll see the PUFF OF SMOKE
from the starter’s gun and Bryson dives into liquid blue
INT DOWNTOWN GYMNASIUM - DAY

Dave makes a basket and turns to see someone else there with
the same agenda as him It’s Darnell They stand facing
each other for a long moment dueling with their eyes
Dave finally fires the ball to him -- an invitation to a
little one-on-one game Darnell smirks Let’s do this

EXT SWIM STADIUM - BLEACHERS - DAY

Julie’s in the bleachers cheering screaming willing Bryson
onto victory

INT DOWNTOWN GYMNASIUM - DAY

Darnell tries to fake Dave with the ball but Dave doesn’t go
for it so Darnell drives right through him hard Dave falls
on his back slamming his head on the court and Darnell
scores Dave pops back up rubbing his head and holds out
his hand for the ball Now it’s his turn

EXT SWIM STADIUM - POOL - DAY

Were TRACKING CLOSE on Bryson as he swims for all he’s
worth With every turn of his head for a breath we see
confidence determination to win in his eyes

INT JOHNSON HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - DAY

Mama enters the room with a shopping back and a rosy
disposition Then she sees Clarice eyes red with tears in
her bathrobe sitting disconsolately on the floor next to her
bed Mama’s face falls She knows what this is about She
been there done that

INT DOWNTOWN GYMNASIUM - DAY

Dave is driving the lane When he hits the free-throw line
he leaps toward the basket Michael Jordan style higher and
higher until his knees are almost at the level of Darnell’s
head And as Dave slams the ball through the basket his
foot catches Darnell square on the face When Dave lands
Darnell is wiping blood from his mouth smiling at him
EXT SWIM STADIUM - POOL

We’re still TRACKING Bryson as he makes his final flip turn
And then suddenly we’re trying to catch back up him because
he has picked up his pace And now we can see that he is a
full length ahead of the next best swimmer

INT DOWNTOWN GYMNASIUM - DAY

Dave makes a desperate attempt to cut off Darnell’s path to

the basket but misses and slams into the wall -- leaving
blood and sweat marks on the wall Smiling he turns back to
Darnell with his own war-wounds -- a bloody nose

EXT SWIM STADIUM - POOL

As parents and his teammates are rooting him on along the
edge of the pool in the bg Bryson is all by himself out
front of the pack and he hits the wall for the win

ANGLE ON BLEACHERS

Julie goes wild with joy and begins hugging everybody around
her But then Julie feels a need to look down at the pool

HER POV

A crowd has gathered around Bryson’s lane Something’s
wrong Bryson’s not getting out of the water

INT DOWNTOWN GYMNASIUM - DAY

Darnell is dribbling the ball when Dave bats it out of his
hand They both go diving after the ball at the same time
and both get their hands on it It’s what’s called a “jump
ball” and they both roll around on the floor wrestling each
other for the ball Finally they both look at each other
realizing how foolish this all is and begin laughing

EXT SWIM STADIUM - DAY

Julie is panicking as she tries to fight through the crowd
And then the gauntlet opens up and she sees Bryson on the
pool deck A small group of people are hovering over him and
A wet drenched Coach Spinello is pushing on his chest over
and over yelling something tears rolling down his face

And a horror she’s never felt before washes over Julies
entire being
INT JOHNSON HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - DAY

Mama helps a disconsolate Clarice into her bed and pulls the
covers up And then notices a flashing light on the night
stand -- Dave’s cell phone She goes over and looks at it

CLOSE ANGLE ON PHONE
The caller ID display reads “SAWYER JULIE”
BACK TO SCENE

Mama scowls She presses POWER button and turns the phone
off She sets it back down with a self-righteous look And
as she does our SONG and SERIES OF SCENES will end

DISSOLVE TO

INT DOWNTOWN GYMNASIUM - SAME TIME

Dave and Darnell are bloodied bruised and completely spent
from their duel and sitting in heaps against the wall

DAVE
I’d call that a draw homey

DARNELL
Man to man nobody listenin’
who gets that scholarship if we was
still back in the day

DAVE
(beat thinking)
You dawg Hands-down World
always gonna love a shooter more
than a big man Plus you just a
better player

Darnell savors these words for a long moment

DARNELL
So you think all the shit I been
through is my own fault

DAVE
Shit comes down on everybody You
can either let it keep you on your
ass Or you can choose to get past
it To beat it

DARNELL
What makes you Dr Phil on the
subject

Dave sucks in a bitter breath reminded of where he at

DAVE
Trust me you ain’t the only one
with problems In some ways you
got no idea how good you got it

DARNELL
You talkin’ about Carlos

DAVE
You ever heard the story about the
man who had no shoes

DARNELL
No

DAVE
He felt sorry for himself until he
met a man who had no feet

(with deep longing)
Don’t waste a minute to be that
boys daddy It’s the only thing
that really matters in this life
Hundred years from now you gonna
be dead and gone But Carlos gonna
have a grandson who remembers his
great-grandpappy Darnell Gooden
You still got a chance to make that
a good memory

DARNELL
(nodding soberly)
That’s some real shit ya’ll And
here I been jealous of you all
these years for gettin’ that
scholarship instead of me

DAVE
Brother I’d trade that scholarship
and everything I’ve ever had for a
son like Carlos

Now Darnell has a question for Dave
DARNELL

So when life knock you on your ass
how do you get back up

Dave is taken aback by the question and right now it’s
clear he doesn’t have a damn clue how to answer

CUT TO

INT JOHNSON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Daylight has ebbed as Dave walks in slowly depleted and
defeated still wearing is sweats Mama is there in the
living room standing by Clarice’s side waiting for him
There’s fire in her eyes that we haven’t seen before

MAMA
Sit your butt down young man We
gonna have a little come-to-Jesus
meetin’

CLARICE
Mama let’s not do this

DAVE
Let her speak Clarice She always
had her own vote in this marriage
Why change things now

Clarice turns and glares at Dave

MAMA
Now you listen to me However you
gettin’ your itch scratched by this
little white hoochie-mama Ho it

your philanderin’ ass up and get
outta Dodge

CLARICE
Mama it’s more complicated than

MAMA

(never takes off him)
No it ain’t Reesie What is wrong
with you boy You got this
beautiful black wife standing over
here and you do the bumpty-bump
with a white girl You must be
addicted to BET and them foul-
mouthed rappers and their nasty
little white fly girls

Dave has kept his mouth shut as long as he’s going to

DAVE
Now it’s your turn you listen to
me you angry bitter man-hating
old woman Whatever is happenin’
between me and Julie Sawyer -- and
I ain’t saying I even know what
that is -- it has nothin’ to do
with her damn skin color

Mama takes off her wig puts up her dukes Fighting mad

MAMA
Where is that skank I’m gonna
knock both ya’lls into next week

Just then the house PHONE RINGS Dave and Mama glare at
each other It RINGS again Finally Clarice sighs and
goes to answer it Mama puts her wig back on still fuming

CLARICE
(answering phone)

BROCK (OVER PHONE)
(somber sober)

CLARICE

BROCK (OVER PHONE)

CLARICE

at Dave with deep concern and hands the phone to him

DAVE
(into phone)
What is this Who had an accident

INTERCUT WITH
INT ALL SAINTS HOSPITAL - WAITING ROOM - NIGHT - SAME TIME

Brock is pacing a room full of empty waiting chairs with his
cell phone to his ear

BROCK
Julie has been trying to call She
finally tracked me down when she
couldn’t reach you on your cell

Dave checks his pockets realizes he doesn’t have his phone

DAVE
Why What happened
BROCK
There’s no easy way to say this
man but Bryson he’s gone
DAVE

Bryson’s gone What the hell does
that mean

Despite what’s happening between them Clarice pulls in close
to listen with him

BROCK
In his final race he went into the
wall too hard He hit his head
They tried to revive him but he
never regained consciousness

Dave feels like he’s been punched in the gut Clarice pulls
away from the phone covering her mouth with her hand

CLARICE
Oh sweet Jesus

BROCK
I’m at All Saints I think you
better get over here

Dave slowly hangs up the phone He’s in shock

CLARICE
I’1ll go with you

DAVE
What

CLARICE

I want to go with you Just ‘cause
I have a problem with that woman
doesn’t mean I can’t look past it
at a time like this

Can a black man look red If so Dave does right now

DAVE
(exploding)
For God sake Clarice what kind of
man do you think I am You think
I’m gonna go over there and get my
flirt on with a woman who just lost
her only child

CLARICE
I didn’t mean it like --

DAVE
(hating this even more)
You know what Hell no I don’t
want you coming with me Not if
gonna do me like that

Dave grabs a jacket off a coat rack and starts for the door
Clarice is frozen Now it’s Mama who fires the big gun

MAMA
Young man I don’t care if Sweet
Judy Blue Eyes lost a whole damn
bus load of children if you walk
out that door Clarice will not be
here when you come back

Dave stares straight at Clarice She does not meet his eyes

DAVE
Clarice has to do what she has to
do And so do I

With that Dave walks out

CUT TO

INT ALL SAINTS HOSPITAL - CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Dave has caught up with Brock and they are weaving in and out
of hospital staff traffic

BROCK
She’s pretty messed up bro Her
parents are driving up from
Houston The hospital didn’t know
what to do with her because she
refused to leave until the funeral
home comes for the for Bryson

DAVE
Where is she now

BROCK

Only place I could think of better

than the lobby

INT ALL SAINTS HOSPITAL -

CUT TO

LITTLE CHAPEL - NIGHT - MOMENT LATER

Dave enters a quiet little
the heart of the hospital

with her head in her hands

hurts for her

DAVE
(softly)
Julie

Julie looks at him through
him sobbing quaking her

JULIE

wood and stained-glass refuge in
Julie is sitting in the front pew
When he sees her Dave’s heart

red liquid prisms She rushes to
voice hoarse with emotion

Oh Dave My baby’s gone My baby

boy is gone

Dave lets himself hold her

his warmth his strength

DAVE
I know honey

tight and she takes every bit of
because she desperately needs it

I am so sorry you

couldn’t reach me I should have
been there At the meet Maybe I
could have done something

JULIE

It all happened so fast It keeps
playing in my head Over and over

It comes out in gasps and she plays it again n her mind

JULIE (CONTD)
He’s winning the final heat and
I’m screaming louder than I ever
have But he doesn’t get out of
the pool right away like he always
did I’m thinking he’s goofing
off Then Coach Spinello is
jumping in the water pulling him
onto the deck pounding on his
chest Then we’re riding in the
ambulance and they’re using the

paddles on him

(breaking down again)
(MORE)

JULIE (CONTD)

He was just lying there with his
eyes closed like when I watched him
sleep as a baby His little chest
would rise with every breath So
peaceful But it wasn’t rising
anymore I thought if I could just
rock him and sing to him he would
wake up and be okay

Dave holds her even tighter stroking her hair

DAVE
There’s nothing you could have done
for him honey But he in God’s
arms now He woke up in God’s
arms

JULIE
Do you really think so

DAVE
I know so Julie That boy was
made for a better place than this

Just then Ted and his “assistant” Kate enter the chapel As
opposed to his cool controlled manner the last time he saw
him he is now a wet emotional noodle

TED
Oh Julie sweetheart Kate and I
came as soon as we heard

He rushes into Julie’s arms and falls into her arms sobbing
It’s awkward Dave and Kate the outsiders give each other
an uncomfortable look

TED (CONTD)
How could this be happening I was
going to come to his swim meet I
really was And then I got hung up
on an account Oh God why didn’t
I go see him Now it’s too late

She pushes back from him and suddenly she has her emotions
in check She is in charge

JULIE
Listen to me Ted Right now I
don’t give a damn about all your
regrets The only thing that
matters is that we hold it together
long enough to honor Bryson the way

he deserves to be honored
(MORE)

JULIE (CONTD)
After that you have the rest of
your life to think about what a
selfish bastard of a father you
were

Ted sobers up quickly He nods wiping his eyes She knows
he’s right

TED
When can we can I see him

JULIE
Tomorrow They’re gonna have a
private viewing for him at funeral
home You can see him then

TED
Julie I’m sorry I really am

JULIE
I know

Ted turns and exits the chapel with Kate As soon as the
door closes Julie crumples into a pew -- as if it took every
last bit of her energy to hold things together for Ted Dave
sits down next to her puts his arm around her

JULIE (CONTD)
Dave what am I gonna do What am
I gonna do

DAVE
We gonna get through this Julie
I promise

And as she turns and sobs on his chest --

A small neatly groomed house in a gentrified neighborhood
with a lawn and garden manicured by hand The kind of place
your very proud grandma would live Clarice’s Cadillac is in
the driveway

INT CLARICE’S CHILDHOOD ROOM - NIGHT

The door opens and a hand turns on the light Mama enters
followed by Clarice and carrying two overnight bags The
room is immaculately preserved right down to the cheer-
leading trophies elementary school pictures on the shelves
and the stuffed animals on the bed little girl’s canopy bed

CLARICE
Mama I need to be at home

MAMA
No Reesie Until we can figure
out how to get that sorry excuse
for a man out of your beautiful
house you gonna stay here where I
can look after you

CLARICE
I’m not ready to do this

MAMA
Yes you are You a strong
independent woman just the way I
raised you I did it And you
gonna be able to do it too

Clarice sighs too weary to argue and sits down on the bed

MAMA (CONTD)
Now you get settled in You gonna
feel a whole lot better when you
have a piece of my famous Sock-It-
To-Me cake

Mama exits Clarice balls up into a fetal position on the
bed clutching onto one of her old Teddy Bears

CUT TO

INT DAVE’S PANEL VAN - TRAVELING - NIGHT
Julie rides along in numb reflection as Dave drives her home

JULIE
I used to drop Bryson off at Sunday
School and he’d come home with all
these bible stories After Ted
left Bryson would pray at night
for him asking God to forgive him
But I haven’t been to church in
years I don’t even know who to
ask to do the service I don’t want
Bryson in some musty funeral home
I want to celebrate his life

DAVE
If you don’t mind I think I know
some people who can help And
celebrate is what they do best

EXT JULIE AND BRYSON’S BUNGLAOW - NIGHT - MOMENT LATER

Dave’s van pulls up into Julie’s driveway where a midsize
car is already parked

ANOTHER ANGLE

As Julie gets out of the car an OLDER COUPLE gets out of the
sedan and rushes to her They are her parents and Julie
falls into her mother’s arms and they both sob right there
in the driveway as Julie’s father tries to comfort them

JULIE
Oh Mommy he’s gone What do I
do My Bryson’s gone

And Julie’s father gives Dave a sad nod of thanks and begins
ushering his grieving wife and daughter toward the house
Dave knows she’s in safe hands now

CUT TO

INT JOHNSON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT - LATER

Dave enters quietly The place is dark empty lonely

INT JOHNSON HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT - MOMENT LATER

Dave walks in slowly and flips on a light He sees that
Clarice’s vanity is open and empty that some of her dresser
drawers are open and empty Without taking his clothes off
he slowly lies down on their bed and stares at the ceiling
And as he does we’ll begin HEARING the mournful soulful
sounds of a small gospel ensemble singing something like Kirk
Franklin’s “HOLD ME NOW”

DISSOLVE TO

EXT MEMORIAL PARK - HIGH AND WIDE - DAY

A carpet of green overlooking the city A resting place for
the dearly departed dotted with headstones And we’1l CRANE
DOWN to FIND a grave-side gathering surrounding a casket
CLOSER ANGLE

And as we PAN the very black singing faces of the GOSPEL

ENSEMBLE we now know who Dave has helped Julie turn to and
the song will take us into

SERIES OF SHOTS

A) Were CLOSE ON a lovely casket and ADJUST to see a
beautiful wreath of flowers and then a framed photograph of a
smiling Bryson Sawyer -- his eyes staring straight out at us
almost immortal

B) We PAN the front row of seated mourners a red-eyed Ted
on one end with Kate standing behind him then Julie’s
mother and father and then finally Julie with Dave in his
best black suit standing behind her

C) A very sober Coach Spinello and several of Bryson’s
teammates all dressed in their matching swim club warm ups
file past the casket and the coach lays Bryson’s gold medal
atop the casket

D) We PAN the very white FACES of the larger gathering of
mourners who have gathered -- friends extended family
schoolmates -- and two black faces -- Bishop Wilkes dressed
in his most colorful hopeful ministerial robes and Carmen
McAtee with her dreads done up with ribbons

E) Dave turns to see Brock arriving with Darius Deshawn
Marcus and Jaylen -- all dressed respectfully in dress shirts
and ties Dave moves to them and shakes each of their hands
before embracing Brock in a long hug

F) Brock escorts his little leaguers past the casket and
each one leaves an offering for Bryson -- a bat a baseball
a glove and finally a team jersey with the name “SAWYER” in
letters on the back

G) Tears stream down Julie’s face as her son is honored
Dave puts his strong hand on her shoulder for support She
reaches up and takes it and holds on for dear life

H) Coach Spinello comes to the front of the gathering and
reads from some typed pages -- the eulogy

I) And as the SONG ENDS so will our SERIES OF SHOTS as
Bishop Wilkes now steps up to the casket and faces the
gathering

CLOSER ANGLE
Before the Bishop begins he looks with confusion at Dave

standing with Julie’s hand on his But Dave can’t or won’t
look at him so he turns his attention to Julie

BISHOP WILKES
Julie as a pastor nothing has
ever prepared me to do the funeral
of a child Not because I’m
feeling any pity for Bryson today
From what you’ve told me he was a
young man of strong faith and I
believe they throwin’ a big
“welcome home” party up in heaven
for him right about now

Which prompts a few tearful smiles from the gathering
especially from Julie

BISHOP WILKES (CONTD)
But for those of us left behind
were always left with a single
question “Why” Folks there
are no easy answers to “why” All
we can do is turn to God and say
“I don’t understand why this
happening What do I do now”

(looking at Julie)

Julie while none of us can carry
your sorrow for you I want you to
know God loves you and so does his
family And my church stands ready
to offer you some great big
shoulders to cry on any time of the
day or night

Julie nods thankfully Then the Bishop’s eyes are drawn to
something os

HIS POV

Clarice dressed in black limps up on her cane close enough
to listen but not far enough to be part of the gathering

BACK TO SCENE

The Bishop looks at Dave who is still looking down and is
clearly unaware of Clarice’s presence He thinks for a long
beat then opens up his Bible

BISHOP WILKES (CONTD)
Julie I don’t know if you’re
familiar with the book of
Ecclesiastes but there’s a passage
I want to read that I hope you’1ll
keep close to your heart

(reading)
(MORE)

BISHOP WILKES (CONTD)
“It is better to have a partner
than go through life alone”

ANGLE ON DAVE
He’s jolted to attention by what he’s hearing remembering

BISHOP WILKES (0S) (CONTD)
“Share the work share the wealth
for if one falls down the other is
there to pick him up”

ANGLE ON CLARICE

She’s listening too trying to remember something from a
long time ago

INT EMMANUEL FELLOWSHIP CHURCH - SANCTUARY - DAY (FLASHBACK)

We’re in church a dozen years earlier as a younger Bishop
Wilkes binds the gold-braided cord around Clarice and Dave’s
shoulders on their wedding day

BISHOP WILKES (VO)
“But pity the man who falls and has
no one by his side In bed two
can warm each other at night But
one alone shivers all night long”

EXT MEMORIAL PARK - ON CLARICE - DAY (PRESENT DAY)

As she listens it all comes flooding back And so do some
tears of regret

ANGLE BACK WITH GATHERING
The Bishop continues the reading

BISHOP WILKES

“By yourself you are unprotected
But with a partner you can face the
worst the world has to offer”

(looking right at Dave)
“But even better than that is a
cord of three strands because it is
not easily broken”

Dave has this unexplainable urge to look away from the
Bishop And when he does he sees

HIS POV

Now he also sees Clarice standing near a tree looking
straight at him And she gives him a tearful nod

BACK TO SCENE

Dave doesn’t know what to do with his feelings and the Bishop
has not missed this connection He turns back to Julie

BISHOP WILKES (CONTD)
Julie what this is sayin’ is that
we need a buddy system One is not
only the loneliest number it’s
also the riskiest It’s our family
and friends who make up the first
two strands of a three-stranded
cord But God makes up the third

(beat thinking)

And it just occurred to me that
maybe God does answer the “why”
questions Maybe the way he does
that is by giving us three-stranded
cords in our lives to encircle us
with love and care no matter
what the world throws at us

And as Julie smiles a watery thankful smile Dave is looking
more confused that ever

DISSOLVE TO

EXT MEMORIAL PARK - DAY - A LITTLE LATER

As the gathering breaks up Dave is seeing Julie to a hearse
in the bg and the other mourners are scattering to their
cars we FIND Clarice still standing by her tree thinking

CARMEN (0S)
It took me awhile but I think I
I’m starting to put the puzzle
pieces together

Clarice turns to see Carmen walking up
CARMEN (CONTD)
Dave with Julie Sawyer over there

and you standing way over here

Clarice nods soberly

CLARICE
(sadly bitterly)
Mama had me move in with her until
we can figure out what to do

CARMEN
He gettin’ his cake and eatin’ it
too

CLARICE

I don’t think it’s gone that far
yet but Mama says it’s only a
matter of time

Carmen sort of gives a little half-chuckle

CARMEN
Your Mama sure does a lot of
talkin’ doesn’t she

CLARICE
I guess so

CARMEN
Clarice I been wonderin’ about
something since you first came in
for counseling

CLARICE
What’s that

CARMEN
When did your daddy leave

CLARICE
He didn’t leave Mama tossed him
out ‘cause she suspected him of
cheatin’ on her

CARMEN
Suspected

CLARICE
Well later when I was grown he
admitted to me that he had cheated
He picked up with a lady after he
moved out of our house

CARMEN
After

CLARICE
Yeah

CARMEN
Maybe it’s just me but it seems
like the acorn hasn’t fallen very
far from the tree

Clarice looks at her for a long puzzled moment but then
something begins to dawn on her

CUT TO

INT JULIE AND BRYSON’S BUNGALOW - LIVING ROOM - DAY

Light is fading out the windows A small gathering of family
and friends including Julie’s parents are mingling over
food and conversation in her modest little house Dave sits
by himself across the room from where Julie is getting an
earful from an ECCENTRIC AUNT with poor funeral etiquette

ECCENTRIC AUNT
Do you remember the time you had me
over to sit when Bryson was two
That little rugrat nearly killed
me I was trying get him out of
the tub and he actually bit me

Julie looks like she’s suffocating

JULIE
I’m sorry Aunt Janet but I can’t
do this right now

Aunt Janet is offended and crosses off Julie looks at Dave
JULIE (CONTD)
Can you drive me back to the
cemetery

Dave looks at her confused for a beat

JULIE (CONTD)
I just need to spend some time
alone there

DAVE
Sure

CUT TO
INT MAMA’S BUNGLAOW - CLARICE’S ROOM - DAY

Mama is HUMMING as she dusts Clarice’s childhood trophies on
a bookshelf when Clarice comes to the door

CLARICE
Do you remember when I won that
one Mama

Mama spins happily to see that her daughter is home

MAMA
(setting trophy back down)
I remember every last one of your
accomplishments baby

Clarice crosses in and examines the trophy

CLARICE
I think this one was after Daddy
left because you said it was the
first time you saw me smile ina
month of Sundays

MAMA
That was good riddance to bad
rubbish Let’s not dredge up all
them bad memories

Clarice sets the trophy back and catches Mama by the arm

CLARICE
No Mama let’s

Mama pulls her arm free and gives Clarice a puzzled look

CLARICE (CONTD)

How come you never told me that
Daddy didn’t start havin’ an affair
until after you rode his ass out
the house

MAMA

I ain’t havin’ this conversation
CLARICE

Why not
MAMA

Because my bedroom drama with your
daddy ain’t none or your business

Which pushes a nerve in Clarice A big nerve

CLARICE
(exploding)
Excuse me I think it is my damn
business when you all up in my
koolaid about my marriage

MAMA
That’s ‘cause you don’t know men
like I do I’m just lookin’ out
for my baby See what that man did
to you swappin’ gravy with some
little white trash biscuit

CLARICE
You missin’ the big picture here
My marriage is on the rocks Who
the hell cares what color she is

But Mama is on a roll

MAMA
Men are like nasty ass little
chiggers You got to hold a match
to their behinds to get ‘em outta
your hair To keep ‘em from
gettin’ under your skin

It’s almost like Clarice is seeing Mama like she’s never seen
her before Shriveled sad bitter pathetic

CLARICE
Mama you sound like Jaws when you
talkin’ about men You like a man-
eating shark up in here Who made
you so angry and bitter Was it
Grandma Clark Was it Grandpa

Clarice has flirted with an emotional trip wire Mama’s eyes
flare for an instant but then she pushes it all back down

MAMA
I am a strong proud independent
black woman

Now Clarice is suddenly feeling pity for her mother

CLARICE
I don’t know what dark secrets you
hidin’ in your heart but in all
your lessons to me about how to be
a strong proud independent black
woman you left something out

MAMA
What

CLARICE
You forgot to teach me how to love
people

Panic washes over Mama’s face She has no answer for this
Clarice kisses Mama on the cheek

CLARICE (CONTD)
Mama I was wrong to yell at you
And I didn’t mean to disrespect
you But from now on I’m gonna
find out how to do that I’m gonna
start learnin’ how to love my man
And I’m gonna pray for you

MAMA
What for

CLARICE
That it ain’t too late for you to
learn how to love people too

With that Clarice turns and walks out Mama tries to
“harumph” it all off and return to her dusting chores But a
beat later she crumbles onto the bed in private agony

CUT TO

INT DAVE’S PANEL VAN - TRAVELING - NIGHT

Dave is driving as the city lights dance off Julie’s face as
she stares blankly out the window A NEWSTALK HOST is
pontificating on the RADIO

NEWSTALK HOST (OVER RADIO)
Now here’s a nice story for a
change The Justice Department’s
latest national crime survey
estimates that murder and attempted
murder fell more than forty percent
from 1975 through 2006

Wincing Dave looks over at Julie He changes the dial to an
EASY LISTENING station Something like Clarence Carter’s
“SLIP AWAY” is currently in rotation

JULIE
Dave can you drive me up to the
overlook

DAVE
You mean after the cemetery

JULIE

Instead of I changed my mind I
want to go look at the stars

Dave gives her a smile that says “no problem”

CUT TO

INT DAVE’S PANEL VAN - POV FRONT WINDOW - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER

We’re looking over Dave and Julie’s shoulders at a sea of
twinkling city lights as the van creeps to a stop at the edge
of an overlook By this point something like The
Temptations’ “Just My Imagination” is playing on the radio

JULIE
I forgot how beautiful this was

Dave is about to turn off the key when Julie stops him
JULIE (CONTD)
Can we just leave it playing I

like this song

DAVE
Sure

Julie opens the door and gets out

EXT CITY OVERLOOK - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER

Julie is standing at the front of the truck looking up into
the night sky when Dave joins her

THEIR POV
The firmament in all its glory A billion shining diamonds

JULIE (0S)
Bry and I used to come up here and
look for The Big Dipper

DAVE (0S)
Down in the city I never realized
the light blocks all this out

The SILHOUETTE of a pointing hand comes INTO FRAME and we
follow to a familiar cup-shaped constellation

JULIE (0S)
Look there it is

BACK TO SCENE

They are both looking up in wonder Julie is still in her
black funeral dress Dave notices that she’s shivering

DAVE
Youre cold Here

He takes his suit jacket off and wraps it around her
shoulders She snuggles closer to him for more warmth
putting her arm through his Just then she remembers a
little ditty and sings a line

JULIE
“Follow the drinking gourd”

DAVE
(smiling)
What do you know about the drinkin’
gourd

JULIE
Let’s see I guess that would have
been our fourth grade report He
chose the Underground Railroad

They both laugh a little at this Then there’s a long moment
of silence She begins to weep quietly again

JULIE (CONTD)
Did you remember your inhaler

DAVE
(looking at her confused)
Excuse me

JULIE

I was trying to remember the last
thing I said to him before his
race That’s what I said to him
“Did you remember your inhaler”
Not “I love you Bryson” Not “I’m
so proud of you” Not “You are a
bright shining star and I’m so
lucky to be your mother”

(tears really coming now)
Oh God why didn’t I say those
things to him Why

She collapses into his arms again and he holds her for a long
moment before she pulls back far enough to look into his
face the starlight glistening on her wet face

Dave’s heart is thumping in his chest as she reaches up and
strokes his face The magnetic connection between them born
of mutual need is just too strong She puts her other hand
on his face and pulls him into a very chaste kiss

They look into each other’s eyes again as if testing whether
or not that just happened And then Dave takes her soft
features into his hands and pulls her into a more real kiss

And the world begins SPINNING AROUND THEM as she pulls in
close conforming her body to his and the kiss becomes
passionate hungry But then the SPINNING begins to slow as
we begin to make out a familiar song “THREE TIMES A LADY”
playing on the car radio

And then we are no longer swirling around them but STOPPING
just as Dave breaks the kiss and pulls away from her His
eyes are drawn to the car window and the memory of that song

JULIE (CONTD)
Dave

DAVE
(frozen with guilt)
I’m sorry I just can’t do this
For more reasons than I can count

JULIE
It’s my fault I was just trying
to feel something anything besides
this big black hole in my heart

DAVE
I know you do Julie And Lord
knows you deserve that But not
this way Not with me We both
been flirtin’ with a fire that
gonna only end up burnin’ a lot of
people

Julie somehow musters a smile through her tears

JULIE
See you’re doing it to me again
The reason I want you so badly is
the reason I can’t have you
Because you’re a gentleman The
most gentle man I’ve ever met

And as he smiles through his own tears and wipes hers away
we begin HEARING his remembering voice once more

DAVE (V0O)
Until that moment I don’t think
Id ever felt like a true man

CUT TO
INT JOHNSON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

When Dave enters in his funeral clothes he’s surprised to
see Clarice there still in her funeral dress sitting in the
lamp light reading a Bible

DAVE
Clarice I need to --
CLARICE
No Dave let me go first Dave

Please
Dave nods and sits on the arm of the sofa

CLARICE (CONTD)
I been round and round with my
heart today and I want you to know
two things First Mama has lost
her voting privileges in this
marriage

DAVE
Damn That’s a big one

CLARICE
(fighting back tears)
And second I’m home No matter
what you decide to do I’m not
giving up on this marriage until
it’s dead Or until we are

DAVE
(chokes back his emotions)
I was about to tell you the same
thing

She rushes into his open arms and they hold each other like
they haven’t held each other in a long long time

DAVE (VO) (CONTD)
I used to beat my head against the
wall tryin’ to figure out what my
purpose was And I looked in a lot
of wrong places to find it

DISSOLVE TO
EXT DOWNTOWN LITTLE LEAGUE FIELD - DAY - WEEKS LATER
Were HIGH ABOVE the diamond as if watching from heaven as

a little league game is in its final moments

The bleachers are packed with CHEERING fans penants have
been hung all around and some Dad PLAY-BY-PLAY MAN is on the
microphone

PLAY-BY-PLAY MAN (OVER PA)
East Side is down to its final out
with the score tied at 5 Looks
like this playoff game may be goin’
to extra innings ya’ll

CLOSER ANGLE

Carlos is leading off at third base while Dave is coaching
third Brock is coaching first and the rest of the East Side
team is biting their nails in the dugout

PLAY-BY-PLAY MAN (OVER PA) (CONTD)
The batter is Darius Jones

As Darius steps up to the plate the opposing infielders move
up to play the bunt Dave gives him a shout-out

DAVE
They playin’ the bunt D Hit it
hard You King Kong up in this
piece

Dave gives him a sign Darius wags his head “okay”
ANGLE IN THE BLEACHERS

Clarice is sitting in the front row She shakes a little
NOISE-MAKER

CLARICE
Whoo hoo Pitcher’s got a rubber
arm

And then we’1ll ADJUST to FIND Darnell sitting not too far
away looking good Looking clean No forties No Ho’s

DARNELL
Come on boy Show me the money

BACK TO SCENE
The opposing pitcher goes into his windup and here comes the
pitch and Darius talks the biggest swing of his life -- BIG
FOUL BALL The CROWD MOANS
DAVE
That’s all right son You got ‘em
scared now

Dave gives him another sign Darius wags his head again

The opposing first and third basemen play back a little
deeper The pitcher winds and fires it in again But this
time Carlos begins dashing home and Darius squares around to
bunt and lays down the perfect little dribbler which rolls
right past Carlos as he slides in home for the winning run

PLAY-BY-PLAY MAN (OVER PA)
It’s a squeeze play Carlos Gooden
slides home safe East Side Wins
East Side wins

VARIOUS ANGLES

As a ROAR goes up in the bleachers the East Side boys all
pour out of the dugout and pile on Carlos at home plate A
dirty dusty human pyramid

Dave and Brock run in and jump on the pile Lots of high-
fives and AD LIBBED celebrations

DAVE (V0O)
But if you want to know the purpose
of a thing you can’t ask the thing
to tell you A car doesn’t know
why it’s a car Only the
manufacturer knows what it was made
to do And I guess that’s the way
it is with God

Darnell races out of the bleachers and to home plate pulling
Carlos from the bottom of the pile -- givin’ him a high five
followed by a hug

And as the rest of the stands empty Clarice is content to
watch from here But something tells her to turn around

And when she does she sees Julie sitting at the top of the
stands all by herself They exchange a nod which doesn’t say
all is forgiven -- but that a truce has been declared

DAVE (VO) (CONTD)
He didn’t just make Dave Johnson to
be a husband or a coach ora
friend or a daddy Those are just
roles Not who I am as a man

EXT DOWNTOWN LITTLE LEAGUE FIELD - DAY - MOMENTS LATER
ANGLE BY FIRST BASE

Darnell is examing Carlos’ glove

DARNELL

You got to put some oil over here
or the laces gonna break

(beat then)
I had my laces break in a game
once Ball popped right out
Ain’t nobody ever told me about
oilin’ a glove

CARLOS
Ill remember that Hey Dad you
wanna hit some me pop flies

Darnell looks at his son breaking out in a broad smile

DARNELL
Let’s do it

ANGLE IN BLEACHERS

Brock climbs the last few steps and straddles the row right
below Julie She looks a little melancholy

JULIE
Thanks for inviting me today
Brock It’s nice to be out in the
sunshine for a change

Brock smiles

BROCK
I thought I should offer to walk
you to your car This ain’t the

safest neighborhood you know
Now Julie musters a little smile

JULIE
Id like that

BROCK
By the way I don’t have a date for
the team party You interested

JULIE
(looking uncomfortable)
I don’t think I better It’s still
too weird But thanks

BROCK
Okay

JULIE
But I wouldn’t mind coffee later

Which perks Brock right up
ANGLE IN DUGOUT
As Dave packs up the gear Clarice

CLARICE
All these years I never
were such a good coach

DAVE
(smiling)
Thanks Boo

CLARICE
I think you gonna make a
good daddy someday too

watches from the bench

You oughta

pretty

He looks at her trying not to read too much into it

DAVE
I hope so

CLARICE
In fact try about seven
months from now

and a half

And as Dave’s jaw drops and Clarice smiles a big happy smile
and Dave takes her into his arms we’1ll PULL UP and BACK into
that big heavenly WIDE SHOT and look down on cords of three
strands happening all over the field

DAVE (V0)

But I guess sometimes God has to

let life turn you upside

down so

can learn how to live right side

up
