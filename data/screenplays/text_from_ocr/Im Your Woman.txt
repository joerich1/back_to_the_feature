CUT TO

INT JEAN and EDDIES HOUSEBACKYARD - AFTERNOON

A BLONDE WOMAN lounges on an OUTDOOR CHAISE BIG SUNGLASSES
a CIGARETTE on her lips A BRIGHTLY PATTERNED SILK ROBE
wrapped tightly around her On a SIDE TABLE a glass of WHITE
WINE and an ASH TRAY

JEAN (VO)
Eddie and Jean were gonna have a
kid but didn’t
(beat)
So every morning Eddie kisses
Jean Eddie leaves the house And
Jeans alone

Bobbie Gentry - I Wouldn’t Be Surprised - plays from inside
The Blonde takes a drag from the cigarette Looks down at her
delicate GOLD WATCH There’s something on her mind Or maybe
she’s just bored

This is JEAN

Smoke drifts up She shifts back and forth then settles She
taps the cigarette in the ash tray and takes a sip of wine

The sun is shining She breathes Until --

She shifts again and her mouth contorts She reaches down and
feels something inside the robe She takes off her sunglasses
and finds TWO MEDIUM-SIZED STORE TAGS hiding along the
seam She tries to pull off the tags without damaging the
silk One RIPS in half but the other stays attached

JEAN
Shit

She exhales And then --
INT JEAN and EDDIE’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Jean makes her way through the KITCHEN of a modern house The
IN-WALL INTERCOM and RADIO plays Bobbie Gentry She emerges
into a LIVING ROOM and then heads up a set of STAIRS to the
BATHROOM

She opens a DRAWER and starts to rummage around inside but
doesn’t find what she’s looking for She opens several more

DRAWERS but she still can’t find anything --

JEAN
Where the hell are the

She turns and goes down a HALLWAY into the

MASTER BEDROOM

and opens a drawer in a NIGHTSTAND Rummages ON THE BED
there’s a DISCARDED RED GIFT BOX from some DEPARTMENT STORE

tissue paper and a thick satin ribbon strewn about

Jean moves to the other side of the bed and checks another
drawer Nothing

JEAN (CONTD)
Fucking Eddie c’mon --

Increasingly agitated Jean goes back to the KITCHEN
The SONG BUILDS --
Finally she spots the KITCHEN KNIVES in a WOOD BLOCK She
lifts herself up onto the counter grabs a KNIFE and starts
to saw at the string back and forth and back and forth --
The FRONT DOOR opens --
JEAN (CONTD)
(still trying to cut the
tags out)
Eddie where are the scissors I
can’t --
She looks up --
Stops Her mouth falls open
We see what she sees

A HANDSOME WHITE MAN holding a BABY

This is EDDIE Jean’s husband
EDDIE

Jean puts down the knife

JEAN
Who is that

EDDIE
He’s our baby

Jean doesn’t know what to say She slides off the counter

JEAN
There were still some tags

EDDIE
Aren’t you gonna say something

The radio is still on She turns it off

JEAN

Eddie Cause I’m not --
EDDIE

JEAN

EDDIE

She places her hands on the counter just to stay upright Her
breath quickens Her eyes shine

Eddie raises his eyebrows smiling and gives her a look
Come on He heads into the LIVING ROOM

Cautiously she follows
Eddie is on the COUCH with the baby Jean sits
EDDIE (CONTD)
(holding out the baby)

Jean takes the baby in her arms She’s in a trance
JEAN

RING RING RING RING

It startles Jean

Eddie stands and gently KISSES the baby on the FOREHEAD then
he KISSES Jean hard on the MOUTH He leaves looking back
over his shoulder one last time before he disappears
upstairs

From another room we hear the phone CLICK as he picks it up
and then his muffled voice talking to whomever it is that
called

Jean doesn’t look up She remains on the sofa quiet and
alone holding the BABY in her arms

CUT TO BLACK

EXT PARK - AFTERNOON

Just a green park Some trees A few children run in the
middle of the grass kicking a ball A WOMAN stands watching

Jean sits on a bench smoking a cigarette The baby asleep in
a STROLLER by her side She takes a long drag and exhales
closing her eyes The smoke billows up around her face --

The baby WAKES --

between her lips she rocks the stroller
INT JEAN and EDDIE’S HOUSEKITCHEN - MORNING

CAP Then she goes to the SINK turns on the TAP and fills
the bottle She grabs a CANISTER OF BABY FORMULA As the baby
cries she scoops formula into the bottle puts the bottle
together and SHAKES it

She puts the baby down in the play pen with his bottle and
moves to the REFRIGERATOR She takes out TWO EGGS and heads
to the STOVE where she holds her hand over a FRYING PAN
that’s been heating on a flame It’s good She cracks ONE
EGG and the YOLK BREAKS as it hits the pan She tosses the
shell in the garbage and she’s about to crack another when --

THE BABY STARTS CRYING AGAIN
The second egg DROPS to the floor

JEAN (CONTD)
Shit

Jean leaves the egg on the floor and grabs the baby and the
bottle Eddie looks up from the paper --

EDDIE

JEAN

Balancing the baby on her hip Jean rushes to the TOASTER --
NOW SMOKING -- and pulls out two pieces of BURNT TOAST Then
she grabs a TOWEL and drops it over the EGG on the floor
Then she picks up a SPATULA lifts up the SINGLE FRIED EGG
and slides it onto Eddie’s plate She moves putting it down
in front of him

Eddie’s fork and takes a bite of his EGG She cranes her neck
and sees EDDIE talking to some MEN shaking hands --
Eddie catches Jean looking and comes over to the entrance to
the Kitchen where there is a set of POCKET DOORS He gives
her a WINK and CLOSES them
Jean takes a breath

He throws several items from a shelf to the floor not seeing
what he needs --

JEAN

He finds what he’s looking for a SMALL LEATHER DUFFLE and a
SHOE BOX He knocks several other boxes down as he grabs
them but doesn’t pick anything up

He pulls away proffering the bag

JIMMY

He shoves it into her hands

JIMMY (CONTD)

She lifts her eyes back up to his searching

EXT JEAN and EDDIE’S HOUSE - NIGHT

In front of the house a LIGHT BLUE SEDAN sits idling with
its LIGHTS OFF Maybe we notice it maybe we don’t

From inside the house we just barely hear the baby CRY

Until the front door OPENS --

Jimmy is standing there He looks out into the night GUN
ready for whatever comes He looks back as Jean steps out
now dressed The DUFFLE in one hand and the BABY in the
other The baby WAILS
She turns back to Jimmy her eyes glassy --
JIMMY
(Nodding in the direction
of the LIGHT BLUE car)
Go

With that Jimmy steps forward and closes the door For a
moment she just stares at the wood

UNTIL --
The HEADLIGHTS of the LIGHT BLUE CAR flick ON and OFF

Jean turns And then slowly she starts down the path
towards the car The baby won’t stop crying

The DRIVER SIDE DOOR OPENS --

A HANDSOME BLACK MAN emerges rubbing his hands together
fighting the cold Gently he moves to Jean --

HANDSOME BLACK MAN
I’m Cal

Jean doesn’t say anything She just looks at him

Cal opens the back door of the car helping Jean and the baby
into the BACK SEAT and then closes the door behind them The
baby’s CRIES are muffled again

Once they’re good Cal gets back into the car

The car BACKS UP into the driveway And as they turn around
we see Jean -- her baby’s head resting on her shoulder --
looking back at the house and the trees and the lawn

The car DRIVES OFF

And then it’s quiet and still Just the street light

CUT TO

INT MOTEL ROOM - LATER
Cal puts the leather DUFFLE on the bed --

The baby’s STILL CRYING --

JEAN
I don’t know what’s going on or
who you are or why any of this is
happening

Cal keeps moving opening the CLOSET DOOR pulling out the
EXTRA BLANKET and PILLOW dropping them on the floor

JEAN (CONTD)
All Eddie said was he wouldn’t be
home tonight but he says that all
the time and then I wake up in the
middle of the night and he’s right
there next to me

Cal goes into the BATHROOM Jean’s eyes follow

JEAN (CONTD)
(re the baby)
It’s weird he’s never like this
it’s like he knows something isn’t
right I mean he cries when he’s
hungry but he just ate

Cal comes back out The CRYING grows --

JEAN (CONTD)

(louder so Cal can hear)
Don’t they say that about babies
That they feel that they feel an
energy Like even if you’re trying
to hide it they know how you
really feel

Suddenly Cal stops in front of her and -- very gently --
TAKES THE BABY She’s not exactly relieved but it’s
certainly something approaching it

Cal sticks his LITTLE FINGER in the baby’s mouth and starts
rocking him back and forth and up and down as the baby
starts to SUCK

After a little bit

The crying STOPS

JEAN (CONTD)
You have your own

CAL

She STRIKES AGAIN --

But still it doesn’t take

She strikes once more and slowly carefully she moves it to
the pile her hand shaking holding it there waiting

A SMALL FLAME ERUPTS

And then she crouches down as far as she can softly blowing
from underneath as the fire GROWS and GROWS --

narrow and then finally she pushes into the --

INT NIGHTCLUB - CONTINUOUS

Where it is COMPLETE CHAOS

Jean ducks down gaining purchase on the grimy floor pushing

her way through LEGS and HANDS and BROKEN TABLES and TURNED
OVER CHAIRS

She TRIPS

She stays down crawling along the floor as people run this
way and that We move through the space with her -- staying
low -- as we hear more GUNSHOTS more SCREAMS

And she keeps going as tables break and bodies fall Women
shout Men yell Glass shatters Guns fire

A DEAD BODY A MAN Just lying in her path
She gets up She looks around She sees something --

SIRENS can be heard out in the city

EXT SIDE STREET - MOMENTS LATER
SIRENS and the SOUNDS from the street
A DEAD BODY LIES against a DOOR

The door inches itself WIDER and WIDER until finally it’s
wide enough for Jean to slip out stepping over the body --

She looks around She walks All along the side of the
building She reaches out to it holding herself up She
catches herself catches her breath heading towards the

BOULEVARD

SCREAMS SIRENS CARS HONK NEON SIGNS and GLOWING MARQUEES
PEOPLE FLOOD THE STREET running from the club CARS are
stopped honking headlights blazing just as the COPS are
starting to arrive

But Jean doesn’t turn doesn’t look As calmly and slowly as

she can she shoves her hands in her coat pockets and walks
in the opposite direction leaving the TURMOIL behind her

EXT SOME BIG STREET - LATER

PEOPLE call out to each other HORNS honk CARS start
Jean walks hands still in her pockets shoulders hunched
against the cold Her arms feel too light it’s strange to
have them empty And then she realizes

The TINY SOCK is gone

She pats around She turns out the pocket where it was Looks
down at the ground behind her It’s really gone

But what she does feel -- and pulls out from the other pocket
just enough to see -- is the SMALL PISTOL

She looks at it looks up and around --

And stuffs it back in her pocket Braces herself Walks on

EXT SMALLER CITY STREET - FIRST HOURS OF MORNING

The first light of morning pours over the buildings and the
street Early risers make their way to work

A GARBAGE TRUCK rumbles by A GARBAGE MAN hanging off the
back as it drives past Jean walking the other way

And it begins to RAIN

Jean stops Feels the rain on her head On her face Her
mouth falls open She takes a breath

And then soaking wet Jean moves on looking for somewhere
to wait out the storm

INT LAUNDROMAT - MOMENTS LATER
Jean comes in SOAKING WET

She looks down the row of MACHINES all WHIRRING LOUDLY
drowning out the sound of the RAIN

People turn and look at the strange wet woman And then
they go back to whatever it was they were doing A YOUNG MAN
leans against a MACHINE reading a MAGAZINE A WOMAN with TWO
SMALL CHILDREN folds a pair of pants

A few other MEN and WOMEN populate the place

Jean sees a row of chairs to her right running along the
length of the floor-to-ceiling window Sitting in one is an
OLD WOMAN wearing large GLASSES knitting a SCARF

Jean sits She wipes her face with her hands but it’s mostly
useless She takes a breath fast and short And another She
tries to slow it down but she can’t seem to get it under
control

OLD WOMAN
You alright

JEAN
Yes fine thank you

But still Jean can’t catch her breath
And then

She starts to CRY At first she tries to hold it in but then
she stops trying She just lets it out

She lets it all out

It’s a big loud ugly cry But still it’s mostly drowned
out by all the machines

The Old Woman reaches out her HAND and -- without looking at
Jean -- places it on Jean’s KNEE and starts tapping gently
OLD WOMAN

It’s okay You’re okay
Jean looks up at the Old Woman Their eyes meet --

OLD WOMAN (CONTD)
Youre okay

Jean takes this in and then looks out into the room

ALL THE WOMEN are looking at her Several of them have moved
closer She takes in their faces Their eyes Their concern

ONE WOMAN steps forward a WARM TOWEL in her hands just out
of the dryer She wraps it around Jean’s shoulders

JEAN
Thank you

Jean takes a deep breath

TERI

Eddie and I had Paul the year we
got married Soon after that I
found out what he really did I
wanted to leave but he promised
the next job would be his last
It wasn’t And it never was

(beat)
Cal was Eddie’s guy but he didn’t
want it Not the way Eddie did I
think it even scared him a little
But he was always there Always
even We started confiding in each
other and eventually we fell in
love

JEAN
(realizing)
It was Eddie you were hiding from
when you were here You and Paul
and Cal

Teri nods

TERI
We came without a plan

Teri looks around the room

TERI (CONTD)
We got restless and we left That’s
when Eddie found us He loved us
too much to hurt us but he wasn’t
gonna let us go without getting
something in return

(MORE)
TERI (CONTD)
(beat)
So we made a deal we get to be
together we get to get out but
one day Eddie would call and Cal
wouldn’t be able to say no

It’s all coming together

JEAN
That was me

TERI
That was you

Jean takes a moment to take this in

TERI (CONTD)
I work at the university and Cal’s
at a moving company Paul thinks
he’s his dad And a really good
one As time went on we thought it
might really be over That we might
have really gotten out We put it
all in a box and put that box ina
secret drawer and thought maybe it
would just disappear

Teri’s holding back tears She shakes her head

JEAN
I’m so sorry

A look passes between them and then --

TERI
That guy Mike at the club he’s a
real piece of shit Always has
been And I knew it would be
dangerous it’s been like that
since Eddie killed Marvin but
going there was the best option we
had

JEAN
What do you mean

TERI
If I’m right word will get to Cal
I’m in the city And once Cal knows
that he’1ll find us

JEAN
Mike works with Eddie

TERI
They did some jobs together Then
Eddie shot his ear off

Teri cocks her head Jean raises her eyebrows

And then we see

Jean her SMALL PISTOL pointed at the place where Mike used
to be

She sits there In shock Breathing deep
She looks at the front seat covered in BLOOD Wipes her
SLEEVE across her face Thinks to herself She starts to nod

her breath quickening and

SHE FLINGS OPEN THE DOOR --

EXT STREET - NIGHT

She opens the DRIVER SIDE DOOR --

INT MIKE’S CAR - SAME

And PUSHES Mike’s body over getting behind the wheel She
looks around Getting her bearings

In the middle of the street Jean does a CLUMSY THREE POINT
TURN and DRIVES AWAY

INT MIKE’S CAR - SAME

Jean drives clutching the wheel eyes straight ahead

EXT UNDERPASS - SAME
Mike’s Car slows down stopping just behind the WRECK
Leaving the CAR RUNNING and the LIGHTS ON Jean gets out

Quickly she moves to the Beige Car And just before she gets
to the window she braces herself holds her breath

AND WRENCHES OPENS THE DRIVER SIDE DOOR --

Teri’s glassy eyes drift to Jean She’s still there

With her eyes Jean tells her she’ll be right back Teri

Leaving Teri’s door open Jean RUNS back to Mike’s Car

EXT UNDERPASS - SAME

She opens the BACK DOOR and summoning strength from some
unknown place she PULLS Another Guy’s DEAD BODY out moving
him down onto the ground Then she takes her gun from her
pocket WIPES it down and puts it in his hand

Next she opens the PASSENGER DOOR takes a deep breath and
mustering that same strength she pulls Mike’s body out

Jean isn’t sure what to do She backs out of the car catches
her breath Then she goes to pull Cal out She strains
Cries out It only gets harder with every body she has to
lift

But she can’t do it Breathless She bends forward hands on
her knees

She looks back up at the end of her rope and --

TERI IS RIGHT BEHIND HER Blood everywhere and breathless

The two women look at each other Jean takes a breath Teri
nods Then they lean into the car and taking hold of Cal
THEY PULL HIM UP AND OUT --

They stumble backwards Together they drag him all the way
to MIKE’S CAR

Teri opens the DOOR and gets in the BACK as Jean hoists Cal
up Teri pulls him in and onto her holding him close

INT MIKE’S CAR - DAWN

Jean gets in the driver’s seat Cal’s chest moves Teri’s hand

rearview at Teri --

JEAN

She puts her foot on the GAS --

CUT TO

EXT DIRT ROAD - MORNING

That familiar dirt road the one that cuts through the tall
trees

Mike’s Car comes around the curve

INT MIKE’S CAR - SAME

Jean at first relieved when the cabin comes into view sees
SOMETHING she doesn’t like

At the top of the hill she STOPS THE CAR Takes a breath and
throws a look back to Teri Teri strains to sit up and sees
it too

IN FRONT OF THE CABIN

A DARK CAR doors OPEN And next to the car a DEAD BODY

Jean makes a decision --

EXT MIKE’S CAR - MOMENTS LATER

The car barrels down the hill towards the cabin coming to a
stop in front

INT MIKE’S CAR - MOMENTS LATER

Jean stares at the cabin Her breath quickens

TERI (0C)
Jean

Jean turns to her --
TERI (CONTD)
I don’t think I can move I don’t
think I can move

She EXTENDS her GUN to Jean

Jean nods Takes it

EXT CABIN - SAME

Slowly cautiously Jean approaches the CABIN Teri’s gun in
her hand And as she gets closer she passes the DEAD BODY

She’s never seen this man before Jean puts her hand to her
mouth --

The WINDOWS of the cabin are SHATTERED GLASS EVERYWHERE A
few BULLET HOLES in the wooden walls

She tightens her grip on the GUN as she approaches the OPEN
DOOR
INT CABIN - SAME

Inside ANOTHER UNKNOWN MAN GUN in his hand is dead on the
ground And then on the other side of the cabin

There’s Art His gun in his hand DEAD

Her heart stops She takes a sharp breath She goes over to
him Bends down Looks at him for a moment

AND THEN SHE REMEMBERS --
She gets up shoves the gun in her pocket moves to the TABLE

and CHAIRS and pushes them out of the way they topple over
each other --

She rips up the RUG --

Tears open the HATCH --

AND --

There’s Paul Head buried in his arms

He looks up and --

Baby Harry is nestled safely IN HIS ARMS

Harry LOOKS UP and the first thing he sees is

HIS MOTHER

He’s looking right into her EYES She’s looking into HIS

And he smiles He just

He smiles
Jean shakes her head in disbelief
And then she looks to Paul --

JEAN
It’s alright now Your mom and dad
are outside Paul

Paul NODS and stretches up handing Harry to Jean --

Jean leans down taking Harry up in her arms holding him so
close She closes her eyes smelling him squeezing him

JEAN (CONTD)
(to Harry)
It’s okay baby your mama’s here
your mama’s here

She inhales then opens her eyes Looks back at Paul

JEAN (CONTD)
Okay Paul We’re gonna we’re
gonna play a game okay You have
to close your eyes and you can’t
open them until I say so got it

Paul nods again
JEAN (CONTD)

And once I tell you to open them
you can’t look back okay

And again

JEAN (CONTD)
Alright Paul close your eyes

Paul closes his eyes and reaches out for Jean She extends
her hand guiding him With that one hand she pulls him up
and out of the hole and with the other she holds Harry
EXT CABIN - MOMENTS LATER

Theyre outside

JEAN
Keep ‘em closed Paul

They walk to the waiting CAR Carefully Jean walks Paul
around the body And when they’re finally at the car

JEAN (CONTD)
Okay Paul You can open your eyes

He does And the first thing he sees is
Teri
Her FACE at the window

She opens the door and Paul falls into her arms She holds
him so tight And then

CAL’S HAND

Reaches out and grabs onto Paul’s arm

Teri turns Cal’s awake He looks into her eyes then he
looks to Paul putting his big hand on his little face They
all hold each other for a moment until Cal collapses back
Then Jean takes Paul’s hand and puts him in the PASSENGER
SEAT and places Harry in his lap Paul puts his arms around
Harry holding him tight Jean closes the PASSENGER DOOR and
walks around to the DRIVER SIDE

INT MIKE’S CAR - SAME

Jean gets in She puts the KEY in the ignition fumbling a
bit as she does

She pauses there a moment Goes to TURN AROUND --

PAUL
You’re not supposed to look back

She stops herself halfway Looks at him and kisses the top of
his head with so much love

Jean looks in the rear-view to Teri in the backseat her
bloody hand still on her bloody chest She nods to Teri Teri
nods back Then she sees Cal barely able to hold her gaze
but doing it

And finally she looks at Harry her baby Her son Oblivious
to where they are to how they got there to the fact that
he’s such a tiny part of a great big world but at the same
time the reason it spins

She turns her eyes forward and STARTS THE CAR

She DRIVES

And we stay on her as the car starts to move at first
slowly and then faster and faster moving down the long

driveway and out into the trees towards the orange and gold
and rising sun

The andna
