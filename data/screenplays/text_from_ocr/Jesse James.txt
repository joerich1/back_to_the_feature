EXT SOUTHERN RIDGE - DAY

FRANK JAMES (stern 38) stands back in the green
darkness studying the terrain 0S we hear the sound
of some fool CRASHING THROUGH THE WEEDS to the rear of
him FRANK opens his coat and slides his hand over his
revolver

VOICE (0S)
Excuse me but I see Ive traipsed
right on in and interrupted you

FRANK turns to see a boy in a stovepipe hat and an
overlarge black coat that’s cinched by a low-slung
holster His hands are overhead as if a gun is upon him

FRANK
Who are you then
BOB
Bob Ford

FRANK
Charleys brother

BOB

BOB receives this as an invitation to lower his hands
He hunkers down next to FRANK and takes off his hat

BOB (CONTD)
I was lying when I said I just
happened down here Ive been
looking for you I feel lousy
that I didnt say so at the
outset

FRANK digs in his pockets and extracts cigarette makings
Hes not inclined to converse

BOB (CONT’D)
Folks sometimes take me for a
nincompoop on account of the
shabby first impression I make
whereas Ive always thought of
myself as being just a rung down
from the James brothers
And I was hoping if I ran
into you aside from those
peckerwoods I was hoping I could
show you how special I am I
honestly believe Im destined for
great things Mr James Ive got
qualities that dont come shining
through right at the outset but
give me a chance and Ill get the
job done - I can guarantee you
that

EXT WOODS - DAY
Dick Charile Wood and Ed sit around a fire
CHARLEY

Hey Dick you ever diddled a
squaw
DICK

CHARLEY

always wanted to lay down with a
redskin

DICK
Well Charley there’s a feeling
that comes over you gettin’ inside
a woman whose hands have scalped a
congregation

WOOD
There’s a thunderous sound that
comes from their cooch on account
of the fact that they birth a child
standing upright like a wild
animal

CHARLEY
What’s it sound like

WOOD
Whatever a thunderous cooch sounds
like Charley I don’t know

DICK
No they got a noisy quim on
account of the fact that they use
their cunnies as a saddlebag to
carry tundries across the plains

CHARLEY
Come on what’d it really feel
like It feel good Come on Fess
up now

DICK
I like you Charley

WOOD
I like you too Charley
EXT SOUTHERN RIDGE - DAY

FRANK slimes his cigarette and strikes a match off his
boot sole
BOB slaps
palm

He stands

FRANK
Youre not so special Mr Ford
Youre just like any other tyro
whos prinked himself up for an
escapade Youre hoping to be a
gunslinger like those nickel books
are about but you may as well
quench your mind of it You dont
have the ingredients son

a mosquito and looks at his blood-freckled

BOB
Im sorry to hear you feel that
way since I put such stock in your
opinions

and rehats himself

BOB (CONTD)

As for me being a gunslinger Ive
just got this one granddaddy
Patterson Colt and a borrowed belt
to stick it in But Ive also got
an appetite for greater things I
hoped joining up with you would
put me that much closer to getting
them

FRANK
And what am I supposed to say to
that

BOB

Let me be your sidekick tonight

FRANK examines his cigarette sucks it once more and
flips it onto the roadbed

FRANK
Sidekick

BOB
So you can examine my grit and
intelligence

FRANK

but the more you talk the more
(MORE )
FRANK (CONTD)

even want you anywhere within
earshot this evening You

FRANK

Why dont you just get now Scat

And after a beat BOB tramps up the hill slapping weeds
aside

14 EXT WOODS - MOVING WITH BOB TO THE GANGS CAMP - DAY 14

BOB passes a number of horses reined to a piece of rope
fixed between two trees He passes MEN aged in their
late teens and early twenties -- hooligans mainly boys
with vulgar features and sullen eyes They cradle
shotguns and wear patched coveralls and foul-looking suit
coats They are known collectively as THE CRACKERNECK
BOYS and are just here to provide atmosphere at the
robbery and easy prey for the sheriff afterwards BOB
clears this group and arrives to a view of JESSE
surrounded by the inner gang the current apostles

ROBERT WOODSON HITE (WOOD) is JESSES cousin sulking and
mooning over some imagined slight

CHARLEY FORD is BOBS older brother who chuckles and
brays and hee-haws and who covers his left boot with a
coat in order to conceal a clubfoot

DICK LIDDIL and ED MILLER can be seen in the bg
working over a cast-iron pot

ED MILLER is the anxious type has a streak of spit where
his spine ought to be

DICK LIDDIL is a good-looking horse thief
BOB eyes this group hungrily coveting admission

squaw but she was purty She had
yellow hair like uh oh like

DICK
Like hair bobbed from a ray of
sunlight

ED
Yeah yeah Like that Boy you

DICK
You can hide things in vocabulary

ED
Maybe you and me could write her a
note send it by post

DICK

predict her needs and beat her to
the punch

ED
Well this girl she had a real
specific job

DICK
Specific

ED
We’s only together once She’s
afraid of lightning She came up
into the wagon and just cuddled
right up to me She gave me a kind
price too

DICK
Well I be That is specific

ED
Yeah sure she been with other
people But the kind of things she
said to me people just don’t say
unless they really mean it

DICK
“My love said she would marry only
me and Job himself could not make
her care for what women say to
lovers you’ll agree one writes on
running water or on air”

ED
My God that’s good Let’s write her
that
DICK
Naw Poetry don’t work on whores

EXT WOODS - GANG CAMP - DAY
JESSE takes a heaped bowl from DICK LIDDIL in his

gunnysack apron He lowers himself onto a stump and
BOB squats in the dirt at his feet

BOB
Am I too late to wish you a happy
birthday

JESSE

How’d you know

BOB
Oh you’d be surprised at what I
got stored away I’m an authority
on the James boys

JESSE

Your brother Frank and I just had

hundred subjects entertained --

JESSE
Good Lord Do you know what this

BOB is dumbfounded

BOB
I dont like to harp on a subject

JESSE

FRANK JAMES is drinking coffee and scowling as he sits on
the far side of the fire JESSE raises his voice

JESSE (CONTD)
I hear you and young Stovepipe
here had a real nice visit

FRANK looks askance at BOB and flings the dregs of his
coffee onto the ground

FRANK
(terse)
Your boys have got about an acre
of rock to haul Dingus Youd
better goose them down yonder

EXT BLUE CUT RAILBED - DAY

A cottonwood tree is skidded down the bank and heaved
over the polished steel rails The CRACKERNECK BOYS
carry boulders of lime and sandstone which they fort
around the tree as SHOVELS SING and picks splinter

JESSE supervises the rock piling recommending land to be
mined for stone chewing his green cigar black

NARRATOR (VO)

The James gang committed over 25
bank train and stagecoach
robberies from 1867 to 1881 But
except for Frank and Jesse James
all of the original members were
now either dead or in prison So
for their last robbery at Blue Cut
the brothers recruited a gang of
petty thieves and country rubes
culled from the local hillsides

Shadows grow long and die Clouds brick overhead and
brindle pink Then crimson Then violet Then black

EXT BLUE CUT RAILBED - NIGHT

Jesse hops down the bank in three plunging steps shakes out
his trouser cuffs and kneels to put his ear to the

rails The HUM of the LOCOMOTIVE is like insects in a

jar

JESSE
Shes right on schedule Buck

EXT SOUTHERN RIDGE - NIGHT
FRANK stubs out his cigarette
FRANK

EXT BLUE CUT RAILBED - NIGHT
JESSE raises the blue bandana over his nose and places
his right boot on the rail as DICK slides down the
southern cliff DICK ties a red bandana over his face
and ambles over shaking the dust from his shirt

The LOCOMOTIVES CHUFFING is GROWING LOUD

JESSES right foot tickles with rail vibrations

The headlamps aisle of white light fills the forest
passage streaks across scrub and bush then bends and
floods towards JESSE He swings his red lantern in a
yard masters signal to stop The brakes are engaged
with an ear-splitting scream Couplings bang Sparks
slice off the rails as the ENGINE swiftly DECELERATES
And a great cloud of steam breaks over JESSE

Then the GANG is running and bounding and skidding down
the embankments

BOB FORD slides down like a debutante in petticoats his
left hand snatching at roots while his right unveils his
eyes long enough to peek around at the commotion

MEN rush alongside the train levering their rifles ina
Manner they fancy is ghoulish and frightening

JESSE hops out of the steam and up onto the cab step and

cocks his revolver The ENGINEER cringes down behind his
hands

EXT BAGGAGEEXPRESS CAR - NIGHT

The BAGGAGEMASTER and EXPRESS MESSENGER have their heads

tilted out the door at radically different heights

BAGGAGEMASTER
Do you think that lock will hold

EXPRESS MESSENGER
No I don’t

The door slams

INT BAGGAGEEXPRESS CAR - SAME TIME
The wood screams and folds inward from the blow

JESSE socks the door open heaves his chest onto the
threshold and knees himself into the room DICK LIDDIL
ED MILLER and the come-lately CHARLEY FORD follow him A
lantern is passed up as JESSE lifts packages and shakes
them and guesses at their contents

JESSE
You got anything good in here

MESSENGER
Could be

JESSE smashes another box on a nail and snags it open
finding inside a photograph of a child in an oval frame
the cheek torn by a nail He looks at it a moment and
then glares at the frightened MESSENGER

JESSE
Open that safe Do it

The MESSENGER looks to the BAGGAGEMASTER for council --
but the mans head is down He looks back at JESSE with
his nervous smile CHARLEY FORD steps forward and
strikes him over the skull with his pistol The man
drops to his knees blood shoelacing his face The
BAGGAGEMASTER backs to wall in horror

ED MILLER
You didnt have to bop him
Charley

JESSE

Yes he did They need the
convincing They got their
company rules and I got my mean
streak and thats how we get
things done around here

CHARLEY grins with accomplishment and JESSE clears some
registers off the only safe he can see

JESSE (CONTD)
Get on over here and attend to this
thing

We hear a wild and scrambled 0S FUSILLADE and DICK
leans outside to see whats going on

INT BAGGAGEEXPRESS CAR - NIGHT

The EXPRESS MESSENGER jerks the company vault door open
CHARLEY FORD empties the contents of the safe into a
grain sack which he hands to JESSE JESSE puzzles over
its contents

clothes JESSE looks at him for a moment then
his pistol and puts it against the unconscious

FRANK gathers two horse blankets and makes his way to an
empty stall

CHARLEY
Hey Frank do you think the

CHARLEY slinks over to the stall and watches as the grim
man hangs his coat

CHARLEY
I had a real fine time tonight

FRANK
You think so

CHARLEY
I wasnt just flapping my lips
about my kid brother and me What
I figured was if you and Jesse
could gauge our courage and
daring you just might make us
your regular sidekicks

FRANK shoots him a look of umbrage as he spreads out a
wool blanket on the straw

FRANK
Your courage and your daring I
about heard all I want to about
sidekicks You sound like your damn
brother

CHARLEY
Ill be square with you it was
Bob who put me up to it Hes got
plans for the James boys that I
cant even get the hang of

around him

JESSE and BOB come out onto the porch with a candle and
two cigars JESSE lowers into a rocker and BOB takes the

lights his cigar

BOB
I cant believe I woke up this

would loan me his overcoat and
here it is just past midnight and
Ive already robbed a railroad
train and Im sitting in a rocking
chair chatting with none other than
Jesse James

JESSE

Bob reaches into his pocket

writhing snakes BOB flinches

snake on the blade

War photographs yellowed newspaper articles and other
James brothers mementoes Then he squirms his boots off
and strips out of his month-old clothes

EXT HARBISON FARM - DAY

Two calves stare with worry as BOB takes a bath in the
broad water tank BOB bends over to rinse soap from his

slides from his face

DICK
No Your brother said Jesse kept
you in Kansas City some extra days

toward the sagging couch

JESSE (CONTD)

a corner of his mouth is stained with tobacco juice

JESSE (CONTD)
You ought to get yourself a wife

JESSE
I just happened by Ed

ED MILLER
Suppose you heard gossip though
Suppose you heard Jim Cummins come

you mightve suspected it

JESSE gets up and jiggles a pants leg over his boot

JESSE
Havent heard a lick of gossip

JESSE looks out at the road and at the sky which is pink
with sunset The road he looks down seems never-ending

ED MILLER (0S)
Ive got six hundred dollars

governors reward

JESSE

shuts the mahogany door

EXT BILL FORDS FARM - YARD - DAY

ashamed checking the road

JESSE throws the boy to the ground and steps a boot onto
his throat

DICK

JESSE glowers at DICK for letting his name slip then
returns his attention to the choking boy

JESSE
He knows where his Uncle Jim is
and thats gonna make him old
pretty soon

ALBERT brawls and kicks at JESSE

DICK
Maybe he doesnt know

JESSE
He knows

JESSE falls to his knees on the boys biceps ALBERT
cries out JESSE clamps the boys mouth shut

JESSE (CONTD)
You need to ask and ask sometimes
Sometimes a child wont remember
much at first and then itll all
come back

He twists the boys ear like a clock wind-up and ALBERTS
body racks wildly his BOOTS THUD the earth JESSE leans
over to examine the injury

JESSE (CONTD)

weeps but cant make words He wipes his nose and eyes
and shudders with sobs as he gasps for air When at last
he speaks his voice is scaled like a childs

ALBERT
You bastard I dont know where

you never even gave me a chance
You kept my mouth shut I never

DICK walks around the barn to the road his face
splotched crimson with fury He climbs onto his mount

When JESSE comes forward DICK looks away squints down
the road in order to talk

DICK
Im worn out I cant --
My minds all tangled anyway
Little deals like this just make
me feel dirty

DICK turns to gauge JESSES reaction to this and is
astonished to see him caved forward into his bay horse
his face flattened into its mane in a grimace of
affliction noiselessly crying

DICK (CONT’D)
You all right Jesse

JESSE nuzzles into the horses hide and mutters words we
cant make out

NARRATOR (VO)
Jesse was sick with wounds and
aches and lung congestions
Insomnia stained his eye sockets
like soot He read augeries in the
snarled intestines of chickens or
the blow of cat hair released to
the wind And the omens promised
bad luck which moated and
dungeoned him

button of red carnage that shuts WOODS motor off WOOD

vanishes and then he falls to the left with a concussion
that jostles the room

DICK looks at BOB with consternation

BOB walks around to WOOD with sickness in his stomach an

He begins to tickle IDAs side and stomach saying
Kootchy Kootch until the girl is sore with giggles and
the fun is over

Oh quit it you two

CHARLEY casts about anxiously for something to say

CHARLEY

CHARLEY laughs and claps his hands

CHARLEY

JESSE suppresses his opinion He regards BOB in a way
that implies the sight is disappointing He skewers a
cigar with the tine of his fork

JESSE

Excelsior Springs Um Youre the
youngest of the three James boys

as your nightshirt when I was
twelve but Ive lost some
curiosities over the years

JESSE is as still as a photograph Smoke spirals from
his cigar in a line and then squiggles above him like
sloppy handwriting but his eyes are active cagey
calculating He comes carefully to life and taps ashes
into his coffee cup

JESSE
Aint he something

WILBUR sniggers

JESSE (CONTD)
Did I ever mention that scalawag
George Shepherd George was one of
Quantrills lieutenants and he gave
me a story like Bobs is why I
thought of him giving me
everything we had in common and so
on just so he could join the
gang How could I know he had a
grudge against me and was lying to

JESSE (CONTD)
get on my good side I said
‘Come aboard George Glad to
have ya George thought he was
smart Cept he wasnt He rode
into camp one morning and about
twenty guns opened up on him But
he only had one eye --
and you need two eyes to get

BOB and WILBUR laugh for a suitable period of time and
JESSE laughs until tears come out of his eyes

BOB
You oughtnt think of me like you
do George Shepherd

JESSE
You brought him to mind

BOB
Its not very flattering

MARTHA waitresses around them collecting cups and
saucers

JESSE
Sure is good eating Martha

MARTHA
Well I’m so glad you enjoyed it

BOB
How come George had a grudge
against you

JESSE
Hmmm

BOB
I said “How come George had a
grudge against you”

JESSE
Oh George asked me to protect
this nephew of his during the war
and it so happens the kid had five
thousand dollars on him The kid
winds up killed and all the money
swiped from him and when George
was in prison someone whispers to
him it was Jesse James slit the
boys throat

CHARLEY
Just mean gossip was it
JESSE
Bobs the expert let’s put it to

him
BOB rises from the table like a stamping boy in a snit

JESSE (CONTD)
Oh dear Ive made him cranky

WILBUR snickers

BOB
I’m not cranky Ive been through
this before is all Once people
get around to making fun of me
they just dont ever let up

MARTHA
Someones speaking awful fresh
over there

BOB
Woman shut your face for once

BOB is forced to walk past JESSE to get to the main room
JESSE kicks a leg across BOBS path clouting the
floorboards with his boot BOB glances down at his bogus
grin -- the suggestion of malice beneath his antics

JESSE
I dont want you to skip off to
your room and pout without knowing
why I dropped by for this visit

BOB
I suppose youre going to tell us
how sorry you are that you had to
slap my cousin Albert around

Such great heat seems to come then from JESSES eyes that
BOB glances away as if from sunlight but in a second the
man cools and says

JESSE
I come by to ask one of you two
Fords to ride with me on a journey
or two I guess weve both agreed

NARRATOR (VO)
Snow storms would move over

GOVERNOR CRITTENDEN speaks to a large crowd of GENTLEMEN
in tails and LADIES in satin gowns

CRITTENDEN
I deem it a great privilege on
this glorious occasion to
recognize publicly the intelligent
and efficient assistance that
Captain Henry Craig has thus far
provided the State of Missouri and
myself in our joint quest to
extirpate the James band from
Jackson County The task Henry
Craig has assumed requires
fearless courage extraordinary
vigilance and an unerring
selection of instrumentalities

BOB lingers against a pillar on the fringes

CRITTENDEN (CONT’D)
My wife has just signaled that
enough is enough But before I sit
I’1l ask you to join me in a toast
to the great son of the state of
Missouri my friend Henry Craig

INT ST JAMES HOTEL - NIGHT

BOB jostles through the crowd insinuating himself closer
to CRITTENDEN He raises his hand in a juvenile wave and
is about to give his name when hes grasped by two
POLICEMEN They clamp his mouth shut and sock him in the
groin He collapses in agony
INT ST JAMES HOTEL - CORRIDOR - SOON AFTER

Take him upstairs boys

INT ST JAMES HOTEL - HENRY CRAIGS SUITE - SOON AFTER

BOB enters looking disheveled DICK guarded by TWO
KANSAS CITY POLICEMEN looks over the top of his paper

of the deal he had made with the

glitter as he regards the two strangers
BOB grins

CRITTENDEN (CONT’D)
Youre Dick little

DICK
Liddil

CRITTENDEN
I beg your pardon

DICK
I spell it with two ds

HENRY CRAIG
Hes given us a confession
Governor but so far the newspapers
havent caught onto it Youve
guaranteed him a conditional pardon
and amnesty for all the robberies
he’s commited

CRITTENDEN
Youre Robert Ford

but cant think of anything to say

CRITTENDEN (CONT’D)
How old are you

BOB
Twenty

CRITTENDEN
Did you surrender to Sheriff
Timberlake as well

HENRY CRAIG
No no govenor It was his brother
Charley who was in the James Gang
We couldnt find anything on Bob
Hes acting in the capacity of a
private detective

CRITTENDEN

Jesse James sent me a telegram
last month saying he was going to
kill me if he had to wreck a train
to do it He said that once I was
in his hands he was going to cut
my heart out and eat it in strips
like it was bacon

(beat)
Im going to wreck his train first

BOB emits a scoffing laugh CRITTENDEN glares at him

BOB
Im sorry Your Excellency I was
thinking of something else

CRITTENDEN
Jesse James is nothing more than a
public outlaw whos made his
reputation by stealing whatever he
could and by killing whoever got
in his way Youll hear some
fools say hes getting back at
Republicans and Union men for
wrongs his family suffered during
the war but his victims have
scarcely ever been selected with
reference to their political
views Im saying his sins will
soon find him out Im saying his
cup of iniquity is full Im
saying Jesse James is a desperate
case and may require a desperate
remedy

DICK looks to BOB to respond -- but sees that the boy is

overpowered by the situation so he responds for him

DICK
Youve got the right man for the
job

CHARLEYS motor works in the silence

CHARLEY
Since were looking to rob banks
I was wondering if I could go as
far as to recommend we add another
feller to the gang and sort of see
if we couldnt come out of our
next job alive

JESSE seems transfixed by a stain on his glove

CHARLEY (0S) (CONTD)
Bob wanted to know could he ride

Jesse fires his gun into the ice below his feet The shot’s
echo hangs in the air

CHARLEY (CONTD)
A saving’s bank or --
Jesse fires again

CHARLEY (CONTD)

Jesse fires a final shot

CHARLEY continues hopefully

CHARLEY (CONT’D)
Bob isnt much more than a boy to

hes smart too -- hes about as
intricate as they come

JESSE
Youre forgetting that Ive
already met the kid

CHARLEY
He surely thinks highly of you

JESSE
All America thinks highly of me

JESSE (CONTD)
Ill say Howd you reach your
twentieth birthday without leaking
out all over your clothes And

forward Then his temper abruptly alters and he slaps
both knees gleefully laughing at BOB

tranquility and miscalculation

BOB isnt sure what woke him He pivots in the

JESSE
You know what John Newman Edwards
once wrote about me He said I
didnt trust two men in ten
thousand and was even cautious
around them The governments
sort of run me ragged
Im going the long way around the
barn to say Ive been feeling
cornered and just plain ornery of
late and Id be pleased if youd
accept the gun as my way of
apologizing

BOB
Heaven knows Id be ornerier if I
were in your position

JESSE
No I havent been acting
correctly I cant hardly
recognize myself sometimes when
Im greased I go on journeys out
of my body and look at my red
hands and my mean face and I
wonder about that man whos gone
so wrong Ive been
becoming a problem to myself

words for an answer so he says

I need to wash my hands if

CHARLEY walks into the sitting room

He sits on the mattress and loops his holster off the
bedpost looking significantly at BOB as he puts it on

JESSE

BOB jumps up from the rocker and it rears and rows
clubbing the floor until he can still it with his hand
CHARLEY

His daughters shoe on the grass
JESSE

JESSE removes his Prince Albert coat and six-button black
vest

CHARLEY shambles over to the screen door to scan
Lafayette Street

JESSE proclaims in a sentence that seems composed just

for Bob

JESSE (CONTD)
I guess Ill take my guns off
for fear the neighbors might spot
them

CHARLEY turns from the screen door with vexation on his
face BOBS thumb twitches as he lowers his hand to his
gun

JESSE unbuckles his holsters and lays them on the bed as
if creating an exhibit

JESSE focuses on the picture of Skyrocket
JESSE (CONTD)
Ain’t that picture look dusty

He withdraws a furniture duster and climbs a rush-
bottomed chair

BOB slinks from the wall and stands between JESSE and his
two revolvers

He shakes his fingers like a gunfighter and instructs his
brother with scared eyes

CHARLEY steps further into the room and the two FORDS
slip out their guns

BOB extends his 44 and cocks it with THREE SOFT CLICKS

JESSE swivels slightly authentically surprised reaching
for a gun that isnt there

Then BOB FORDS 44 IGNITES and a red stamp seems to

paste itself just behind the outlaws right ear His
face socks into the watercolor glass GUNPOWDER AND GUN
noise fills the room JESSE drops from his knees and
smacks onto the floor like a great animal shaking the
house with his fall

ZEE rushes into a room that is still blue with smoke and
screams

BOB slowly retreats and straddles the windowsill
ZEE
What have you done

BOB looks stricken as though he wants to apologize but
cant

JESSE looks at the ceiling his fingers curl and uncurl
his mouth works at making words

ZEE kneels and cradles his skull in her apron
ZEE (CONTD)
No Oh Jesse Jesse Jesse Jesse
Her petticoats are quickly soaked red with his blood
TIM is at the door seeing everything

ZEE (CONTD)
Bob have you done this

BOB
I swear to God that I didnt

JESSE sighs and grows heavy on her legs His muscles
slack the blood is as wide as a table He makes a
syllable like God and then everything inside him stops
CHARLEY collects their hats and coats

CHARLEY
It was an accident Zee The pistol
went off accidentally

The two FORDS make their way to the door

NARRATOR (VO)
It was widely felt that Bob

Charley not a jot

CHARLEY takes off his revolvers and flings them onto the

Charley was only expected not to
slouch or mutter and to transport
his sicknesses to the alley before
letting them go

CHARLEY fetches a feather duster and flags it towards an
implausible painting of the death of Julius Caesar

CHARLEY
That pictures awful dusty

BOB rises surreptitiously from his chair CHARLEY flicks
the duster

BOB raises his gun
Some in the audience stir with anticipation

BOB lets the hammer snap and a charge of GUNPOWDER
EXPLODES with a great noise on the stage

The audience gasps

and crashes unauthentically to the floor

A GIRL playing Mrs James runs onto stage from the right

NARRATOR (VO)
Something began to change in
Charleys stage portrayal of
Jesse his limp seemed more
practiced his high voice was
spookily similar to the mans his
newly suggested dialogue was
analogous to a script Jesse might
have originated

He began to look at his younger
brother with spite as if he
suspected that in some future
performance he might present
himself to a live cartridge in
Robert Fords gun

A voice comes from the dark beyond the footlights

and a heart and a brain

The SINGER begins to stroll the room coming so near BOB
that BOB has to pull back his legs to let him pass

SINGER (CONT’D)
Oh Jesse had a wife to mourn for
his life Three children they
were brave But that dirty little
coward that shot Mister Howard has
laid Jesse James in his grave

BOB works at registering no change in expression

SINGER (CONTD)
It was Robert Ford that dirty
little coward I wonder how does
he feel For he ate of Jesses
bread and he slept in Jesses
bed Then he laid Jesse James in
his grave

Finally BOB can stand it no longer He takes out his GUN
and FIRES into the floor The noise is deafening
Everyone turns to BOB in the silence that follows BOB
lurches slowly to his feet

Im Robert Ford

He flings his pistol at the SINGER and tilts slightly
from the alcohol
BOB (CONT’D)
It was two children not three

shells and ends up on the floor tears glinting in his
eyes He gets to his feet and sways for a moment
