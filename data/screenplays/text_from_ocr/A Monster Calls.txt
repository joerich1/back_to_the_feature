InT conoR’S BEDROOM - night - conTINUOUS 1

Conor (12 small on the border of puberty) sits up in bed
frightened sweaty panting

He looks at the clock 1158

It’s a messy but homey bedroom Posters at the borders of
manhood on the wall rugby teams but also cartoons Old
stuffed toys in corners framed PHOTOS of Conor and his MUM
of Conor and friend LILY in a school play a laptop handheld
games scattered DRAWINGS he’s made Conor lays back down to
sleep but

A heavy COUGHING from offscreen Conor listens concerned
The coughing doesn’t come again He sits up
InT conor’s hallway MUM’S BEDROOM - night - conTINUOUS

Conor pads quietly down the hallway until he gets to his
Mum’s bedroom door It’s open slightly He looks in

In the moonlight Mum is asleep alone in her bed Her head
is obscured by pillows

CONOR
Mum are you asleep

Mum
Yes

CONOR
Are you sure

Mum
(opens one eye to him)

InT mum’s bedroom - the next morning 4NEW

Conor is VERY deep asleep having obviously stayed there all
night His mum is asleep too gently snoring

In the dawn light we now see a LINE OF MEDICINE BOTTLES on
Mum’s DRESSER A wig on its stand on the dressing table

Conor wakes sits up Mum doesn’t wake He pulls the covers
over her He doesn’t glance at the medicine bottles They’re
obviously part of his daily life

Very slowly making sure he is not making any noise Conor
gets up and heads out into the day by himself
INT conOR’S BEDROOM - MomenTS LATER

Conor begins what is obviously a familiar routine

He puts on his school uniform trying for the untucked
rebellious look that he’s still just slightly too young for
(he tries to make his hair look cool in the mirror and puts
it up but he looks funny and puts it down again etc)

He opens a drawer No clean socks left
8A

EXT CONORS BACKGARDEN - MOMENTS LATER 8A

Conor gets out to the backgarden to where the clothes are
hanging to look for a clean pair of socks but all the clothes

are wet He takes a wet pair of socks and goes back into the
house

Conor stuffs the WASHING MACHINE with LAUNDRY over-filling
it but shutting it all in the door

Conor pulls the duvet over his bed so it’s made if quite
messy (Clumsily hiding the wrinkles of the duvet under the
cushions )

Int conor’s house upstairs hallway - momENTS LATER 11

Conor looks at his Mum’s bedroom (the door is closed) and
then over the top of the stairs Down in the kitchen we can
hear the faint sounds of a WOMAN on her phone This is
GRANDMA (mid-50s crisp professional VERY ungrandmotherly)

Conor only sees the top of her head as she exits still in
her coat still on her phone scolding someone sternly We
dont see her face in these scenes She also is clearly
making an attempt to keep her voice down

GrANDMA
(into phone)
Because I’ve got three showings
today that’s why I’m not
responsible for your sick
Weimaraner-

He steps back so she won’t see him We only catch a glimpse
of her as she leaves

He waits a beat then starts down the stairs but she re-
enters carrying bags of groceries still on the phone Conor
freezes Grandma stops in the hall angry at something that’s
been said

GranDMA (CONT’D)

(into phone)
How dare you throw that in my face
Do you have any idea what-

(beat listens gathers

self still angry

whispers fiercely)
Now you listen to me Marcus I
know full well you’ve covered for
me-

Storms into kitchen We hear her still talking Conor waits
nervous She exits the kitchen again still whispering

GRANDMA (CONTD)
(into phone)
Fine Fine I’11 call her myself
(hangs up)
Lazy bastard

She exits again Conor waits a beat then goes downstairs

Conor deeply curious heads towards the kitchen Then he
HEARS THE FRONT DOOR again and steps quickly into-

InT conor’s sittING ROOM - conTINUOUS 12

again enters looking for a pen and paper

GRANDMA

(into phone)

(rolls eyes)
Of course Ill give you your
commission

She looks around the warmly messy sitting room lifting
things and looking for and finding a bit of paper She keeps
looking

GraNDMA (CONTD)
(to herself)
Pen pen pen This house-
(into phone)
Yes I’m here right now
(almost snapping)
She’s fine

Conor watches waiting to be discovered but his grandma
never even turns around She finds a pen

GRANDMA (CONTD)
(into phone coldly
finding it hard to say
thanks )
Yes Thank you I appreciate it

Hangs up as the caller is mid-sentence Leaves By sound
Conor follows her movements into the kitchen out again and
out of the house He waits until her car starts before he
feels safe to move again

InT conor’s kitCHEN - momentS LATER 13

On the counter there are now BAGS OF GROCERIES and a closed
CARDBOARD BOX with a POST-IT NOTE on it Conor reads it
doesn’t react

Opens the groceries They’re FULL OF MEDICINAL-LOOKING HEALTH
FOOD Conor makes a face

scratches the burnt stuff off with a knife The black dust
falls on the white plate He makes a couple of strokes on the
dust with his finger and creates a drawing

InT conOR’S KITCHEN - MomenTS LATER 14

Conor throws away his leftovers (there’s a lot he didn’t
eat) and washes the breakfast dishes on the sink He stays
there for a moment absentminded staring out the window

Looks at the clock again There is something he needs to

Int conoR’S KITCHEN - mornING - MomenTS LATER 15B

CONORS MUM leans against the kitchen counter with a cup of
tea scarf tied around her head She’s clearly undergoing
CHEMO-THERAPY thin pale bald Exhausted but facing it
well Conor SWEEPS up the glass

Mum

Mum is surprised at strength of his interruption but she
lets it pass She turns to the groceries and the box

MuM

us tomorrow for a few days

CONOR
Aw mum We don’t need her here-

MUM

Frases Conor complaining

Beat as it’s Conor’s turn to be shocked at the interruption
Mum exhausted smiles again

Mum (CONT’D)

all I can take too Like living
with your boss

(laughs)
She’s going to bring me a box full
of wigs she got somewhere if you
can believe it Be lucky if I don’t
end up looking like a zombie Lady
Gaga

Conor is relaxing the atmosphere improving Mum regards him
for a moment then ruffles his hair

MUM (CONTD)
(fake serious)
Now tell me you haven’t shrunk my
favourite wool jumpers

Conor laughs shyly

Mum (CONT’D)
Go on go
(as he crosses to his bag)
Stop dragging your feet

He picks them up comically like a clown As Conor puts his
rucksack on Mum leans against the counter looking out the
window

16-16A EXT CONOR’S HOUSE DRIVEWAY STREETS - later 16-16A

Conor walks to school rucksack on his back It’s a bit of a
journey and he pulls his coat tight against the cold

Ext SHOP ROAD - moRNING 16B

He’s deep in thought but he’s distracted by one SHOP WINDOW
(the ART SHOP where his paper bag was from) Inside the
window are a set of art pencils that he obviously craves

He’s about to walk on but he sees someone down the street He
steps into the doorway to hide while he watches

A girl LILY 12 thick glasses the friend from the photo in
his bedroom She’s harmless goofy charming but Conor holds
back so she won’t see him

17 Ext SCHOOL OUTSIDE - momENTS LATER 17

Establish Conor and Lily are in the first year of secondary
so they’re the tiniest students among giants

ExT ALLEY SPORTS FIELD - later 18

CU on Conor falling as if pushed hitting the concrete
path Still down he puts his hand to his lip It comes away
bloody

Behind him we see HARRY 13 blond wonder boy calmly
vicious bully flanked by ANTON and SULLY both 13 Harry is
straightening his leg clearly having tripped Conor

Harry
Careful there O’Malley You might
fall

The minions laugh Conor is resigned This isn’t new He
reaches for his bag and starts to get up but a perfectly
timed trip from Harry sends him falling again

HARRY (CONTD)
Always off in your own little
dreamworld What’s there that’s so
interesting O’Malley

The minions keep laughing Conor starts to rise again
There’s blood on his lip

sully
(joyous)
He’s bleeding

anton
He’1l have to get his slaphead
mother to kiss it for him

Silence as the group absorbs this crossing of the line
Conor’s face hardens but before he can respond Lily bounces
back into the scene

Lily
You leave him alone Cowards
There’s three of you and one of
him I’m not scared of you You’re
pathetic

Conor winces and Harry’s minions are already laughing Not
Harry though who never stops looking at Conor

SuLLY
Your puppy’s here to save you
OMalley

Outraged Lily - who is in fact a little puppy-ish - pushes
Sully hard Surprised he falls backwards over a shrubbery

LILY
I’m just making it a fair fight

MISS KWAN (0S)
LILY EVANS

Everyone freezes as Head of Year MISS KWAN (late 30s British-
Chinese descent stern but fair) storms over

LILY
They started it Miss

MisS KWAN
I don’t want to hear it
(to Sully now rising)
Are you hurt Sullivan

Sully seeing an opening fakes injury Badly

sully
I might need to go home Miss
MISS KWAN
Don’t milk it
(to Lily)
My office Lily
LILY
But Miss they were-
MISS KWAN
Now
LILY
They were making fun of Conor’s
mother

Everyone freezes A dangerous silence

Miss KWAN
Is this true Conor

Conor looks from Anton to Sully and on to Lily her face
burning with injustice but then to Harry who is as calm and
firmly fixed on Conor as ever

ConoR
(eyes on Harry)
No Miss I just fell They were
helping me up

Lily looks like she’s been slapped

MISS KWAN
Get to your forms
(to Lily)

Not you

Miss Kwan drags an aghast Lily away Conor watches them go
When he turns back Harry is holding out Conor’s bag for him
Harry
Well done O’Malley

Beat Conor takes the bag and makes his way inside

Int Physical Social and Education class - lATER 19

A Powerpoint display at the front of the class reads “THE
MIRACLE OF BIRTH” MR CLARK 40s wry kind perhaps a bit
soft steps up next to it

Mr Clark
Brace yourselves

Conor sits at the back an empty desk next to him He looks
very drowsy

MR Clark (CONTD)
Weve been studying this all week
You’ve seen the diagrams heard the
descriptions You think youre
ready to watch the real thing

He gives a you-have-no-idea-what-you’re-in-for chuckle and
clicks to start a hilariously graphic CHILDBIRTH DOCUMENTARY
on the Powerpoint

The sounds from the documentary (The cervix fully dilates to
10 centimeters and the babys head crowns when the widest
part of it reaches the vaginal opening” complete with sounds
of a mother in labour) fade as we focus on Conor looking
exhausted falling asleep propping up his face with his hand

He’s sitting under the AC vent and the sound of it starts to
merge with a WIND sound that eventually rises to the
SOUNDTRACK of the NIGHTMARE we heard over the TITLES We
close on Conor the soundtrack rising to a FAINT SCREAMING
(Conor”)

Mr Clark (CONT’D)
Conor

Conor jumps as Mr Clark is right next to him He waits to see
if he’s in trouble But Mr Clark looks overly sympathetic

MR Clark (CONT’D)
You all right there You look
tired
(beat nothing from Conor)
You know if you ever wanted to
talk-

He’s interrupted by a labour-scream from the video and an
accompanying SHOUT OF HORROR from the class who can’t believe
what they’re seeing (As soon as the babys head comes out
the doctor will suction amniotic fluid blood and mucus from
they baby’s nose and mouth”) Mr Clark looks up with an
amused smile gives Conor a last look and keeps patrolling
the classroom

Conor sees Harry a few seats over Harry’s watched the
exchange and looks as if he’s sussing Conor out somehow

As the sounds of childbirth and the accompanying trauma of
the class continue (The umbilical cord will eventually fall
off due to a combination of putrefaction and mummification”)
Lily enters from the front eyes swollen from crying She
sits next to Conor in the empty desk He doesn’t acknowledge
her despite her furious gaze

Wounded she looks up at the video and is comically horrified
by what she sees

Mr Clark reaches the front of the classroom as the sounds of
childbirth reach their exhausted conclusion (“And mother’s
happy ordeal is finally over”) Mr Clark clicks off the
Powerpoint and turns to the class

Mr Clark (CONT’D)
Any questions

Apart from Conor Lily and Harry every single traumatised
hand in the classroom shoots into the air

EXT BIN street - that afternoon 20
Conor walks home by himself lost in thought

LiLY (oS8)
Hey Wait Conor wait

She catches up to him He ignores her

LilY (CONTD)
Why did you do that today Why
didn’t you tell Miss Kwan what
really happened

Conor
Why did you butt in when it was
none of your business

LILY
I was trying to help you

CONOR
I don’t need your help

LILY
(visibly hurt)
My mum keeps asking why you don’t
come over anymore

Conor says nothing

LilY (CONTD)
(now genuinely distressed)
What the heck is wrong with you
I’ve got detention all week now

CONOR
That’s not my problem

LILY
But it’s your fault

Conor turns on her in fury She steps back frightened

ConoR
It’s your fault It’s all your
fault

He takes off walking again leaving her behind

LiLy
(calling after him)
We used to be friends

Conor carries on down the street fast at first then slowing
as he nears his house He looks back to see if Lily is still
there half-hoping she will be She isn’t

InT conor’s sitting room - momentS LATER 21

Conor enters not too happy Mum is waiting there cardboard
box open Conor looks wary at an OLD-FASHIONED SUPER 8 FILM
PROJECTOR Canisters of FILM sit next to it Mum is nervous

excited

ConOR
What is it

INT conor’s sitting room - momENTS LATER 22

Conor and Mum set up the projector Neither of them really
know how to do it so they figure it out together threading
the film getting it wrong eventually getting it right

MuM
Your granddad’s old film projector

CoNOR
You mean like a video player
MUM
(laughs)
No this is a relic a proper
dinosaur
CONOR
(long beat)

What are we supposed to do with it

Mum
I wish you could have met him Even
your grandma softened up around
him By the way she is coming to
stay with us tomorrow for a few
days

CONOR
Aw mum We don’t need her here-

MUM
You know how I get at this point in
the treatments-

CONOR
We’ve been okay every time before-

Mum
You shouldn’t have to make yourself
breakfast every morning-

CONOR
I’m fine-

MUM
CONOR

Conor’s a bit shocked at the strength of the interruption
Mum is too Exhausted she smiles again

Mum (CONT’D)
Only a few days I promise That’s
all I can take too Like living
with your boss

She laughs Conor tries to too

MUM (CONTD)
Can we just enjoy the movie I got
it for us

ConoR
(picking up film canister)
What are we watching

MUM
King Kong Oldie but a goodie

ConOR
Are we really going to watch
something though You always fall
asleep

MUM
I won’t fall asleep I promise
(stepping back)
Right I think we got it

Black and White TITLES come up for KING KONG

CONOR
(moans )
You didn’t say it was black and
white

MUM
(mischievous)
Be happy it’s not a silent movie

CONOR
Mum

MUM
Shush

Conor nestles in to watch unhappy

InT conor’s sitting room - later 23

It’s dark outside now Conor despite himself is still
watching We can see leftovers of the pizza they ordered He
looks over His mum is asleep against the arm of the settee

He reaches over and covers her with a blanket and keeps
watching it

But it’s the sequence where KONG is on the Empire State
Building BI-PLANES ATTACK and KONG falls-

Conor is surprisingly shocked by this obviously triggering
some memory He watches as Kong falls and falls and falls

Then with a burst of WHITE the reel finishes leaving Conor
watching a blank white space We zoom in on the white and
dissolve to

Int conor’s BEDROOMHALLWAY - that night 24

A white sketchpad sheet A hand comes in to draw Conor at
his desk It’s RAINING heavily outside now and his window is
covered with condensation His clock reads 1134

He draws KONG on the skyscraper It’s good He FLIPS THE
PAPER OVER and draws BI-PLANES on the back He holds it up to
the desklamp He flicks the light on and off making the
planes appear and disappear like they’re firing shots (Sound
Effect “Ratatatatatata” leading us to sound of nightmare)

Then he draws Kong falling He gets lost in it and the sound
of the NIGHTMARE rises again This time we even see flashes
of it

NIGHTMARE 24A

--FLASH OF TWO PAIRS OF HANDS locked in a ferocious grip
as if one is trying to keep the other from falling

Conor keeps drawing almost furiously

NIGHTMARE 24B

--FLASH OF VIOLENT MOTION dark and burning
Conor keeps drawing as the soundtrack intensifies He

doesn’t notice a breeze tousling his hair or the pencils
rolling across the desk again

NIGHTMARE 24C

--FLASH OF A DISTANT FIGURE ON A CLIFF’S EDGE calling
out “CONOR ”

Soundtrack ceases as he sits back and blinks at the
sketchpad He’s drawn a GAPING HOLE OF BLACKNESS that looks
as if it might swallow the whole world A face - possibly
HIMSELF - stands at the edge of it looking back up to us

He suddenly hears hurried footsteps in the hall They rush
past his room to the toilet We hear his mum being brutally
sick Conor waits She vomits again

ConOR
(calling to her)
Do you need any help

Mum (0S)
(beat forced cheer)
No sweetheart

Beat then water running Footsteps He covers the nightmare
with the Kong drawing and quickly moves back to his bed She
opens his door

CONOR
You okay

Mum
I’m kind of used to it by now
Sorry I dozed off during the film
You should be asleep too

ConoR
I was I am

She sees his desklamp still on She goes over and picks up
the sketchpad including the nightmare drawing Conor is
alarmed Mum sits down on the bed next to him and looks
through his Kong sketches

MUM
This is good Conor Such a sad
ending

Conor
(troubled)
Why did they kill King Kong

MUM
People dont like what they dont
understand They get scared

Conor
Her boyfriend was a jerk

MUM
Yeah hes pretty bad

Conor
King Kong should have squashed him
Broken him into a million pieces
(makes squashing motion)
Boom

She smiles and turns to the nightmare finally a little
scared by the hole and the face he’s drawn but she looks
closer It has very realistic eyes She’s very surprised and
impressed

MUM

What is this Is that you
Conor

No Mum
MUM

Looks like you
Conor shrugs

MUM (CONTD)
Its very good Really REALLY
good The strokes of the pen And
I love the reflection in the
eyes Life is in the eyes you
know

(gentle beat)

Whats it of Whats this scene

Conor
(shrugs)
Nothing Just I made it up

MUM
Well doesnt matter where it comes
from if its true Thats what
artists do They say the truth

Conor smiles Suddenly the mother realizes what time it is
MUM (CONTD)
Gosh its late isnt it Time for

us both to be asleep

She bops him playfully on the head with the sketchpad

InT conOR’S BEDROOM - night - conTINUOUS

Conor is back on his bed in the dark bedroom He cant get
back to sleep He sits up and looks at his small DRAWING DESK

in the corner
3A

EXT churchyard hilltop - night - continuous 3A

A YEW TREE huge ancient ominous looms on the hill
overlooking Conor’s house Its needle-like leaves are sharp
in the moonlight red berries clustered throughout its
branches It sits in a small churchyard on a hilltop a
graveyard stretching down the hill in front of it

Down below Conor’s bedroom desk light comes on
3B

InT conOR’S BEDROOM - niGHT - conTINUOUS 3B

Conor takes out drawing pencils and sharpens them He takes
out an inexpensive SKETCHPAD out of a PAPER BAG from an art
store Tired but awake he flips through the earlier sketches
- fantastical things superheroes etc they’re very good -
and finds a blank page

He taps the pencil to his teeth wondering what to draw His
clock ticks over to 1207 and as if on cue

monster (0S)
(whispering)
Conor

A monstrous voice deep old as the earth itself Conor looks
immediately to the door Did he actually hear that

ConoR
Mum

But it’s not coming from the door He looks out his closed
window It dramatically frames the hilltop with the yew tree
Conor decides to draw it making a frame on his page for the
window A pencil starts to roll across the desk

Conor sees it looks back up to the window the YEW TREE IS
NO LONGER THERE

Conor is astonished confused Conor stands and looks out the
window It’s shut but a breeze tousles his hair
3C

The yew tree is now standing farther down the hill 3c
Conor stares in disbelief As he watches the tree begins to
change It shifts and splits twisting slowly incredibly
into the shape of a TOWERING MAN

--two muscular arms made from branches twining together

--a second leg placed down beside the trunk

--the uppermost branches gathering into a great and terrible
face with huge monstrous eyes

Conor watches amazed but not overly afraid

THE MONSTER huge and impressive strides across the rail
line over Conor’s back fence and stands up in front of him

MonSTER
Conor OMalley

The voice echoes and booms The Monster suddenly FALLS
against the house its hands on either side of Conor’s
window lowering its head to peer inside

The Monster pushes against the house It creaks under the 3D
Monster’s weight

MonstER (CONT’D)
I have come to get you Conor
OMalley

Conor
(beat)
So come and get me then

Monster
What did you say

Conor crosses his arms

CONOR
I said come and get me then

The monster roars terrifyingly Conor hides at one side of
his desk and puts his hands over his ears at the sheer volume
of the Monster’s voice

MONSTER
(taunting)
Why don’t you run Conor OMalley
Why don’t you run for your mother

Conor looks surprisingly defiant at this He stands and
closes his bedroom door as if to protect his mum

CONOR
(surprisingly defiant)
You leave her alone I’m not afraid
of you
A beat as the monster impossibly looks surprised-

And disappears
3E

Then it ROARS and PUNCHES an enormous fist through Conor’s 3E
window taking out a large section of the wall

Conor at last tries to run but the monster is too fast
grabbing him up and pulling him out of his bedroom

3F IE CONOR’S BEDROOM - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS 3F

lifting him high into the night The Monster roars again
still terrifying

3G In the Monster’s grasp Conor can barely breathe but he 3G
looks surprisingly defiant The Monster stops perplexed

The Monster gets an angry look

MONSTER
You will be Before the end I will
visit you again on further nights
Conor OMalley And I will shake
your walls until you wake And then
I will tell you three stories And
when I have finished my stories
you will tell me a forth and it
will be the truth Your truth

CONOR
(scared now)
What are you talking about

MONSTER
This truth that you hide
(glowers )
The truth you draw Conor OMalley
The truth you dream

CONOR
No No way-

MONSTER
For this is why you called me

CONOR
Called you I didn’t call you-

MONSTER
You will tell me the fourth tale
You will tell me the truth

CONOR

emerge from it like tentacles trying to reach Conor’s face

her back turned to him in the sitting room Mum red scarf
tied around her head sits on the couch looking into a box
She glances up and sees Conor causing GRANDMA to turn

Grandma
(crisp not entirely
friendly)

of but Mum’s face immediately goes serious again

Conor shares one last conspiratorial look with his Mum

the yew tree sits innocently atop the hill He hears raised
voices from the sitting room

30A EXT CHURCHYARD HILLTOP CONOR’S HOUSE - MORNING 30A

He stares HARD at the tree while his mum and grandma
argue and the kettle whistle gains in intensity

GranDMA (0S)
this has gone on far too long
these things need to be discussed-

Mum (0S)
Ma I know what I’m doing-

GRANDMA (0S)

Yes all those marvelous impulsive
decisions that never affect your
life at all-

MUM (0S)

Says the woman who schedules her
toilet breaks Seriously Ma We’re
having this conversation now

GRANDMA (0S)
I’m sorry I’m sorry I just-

MUM (0S)
Go help Conor with the tea or I
will literally go insane

Kettle whistle sound stops as Grandma enters kitchen She
regards Conor hands on hips

GranDMA
(beat all business voice
low so mum can’t listen)
You and I need to have a talk

Conor stiffens This isn’t the first time for this

ConOR
I’m making tea

GRANDMA
Conor-

CONOR
I’m making tea

GraNDMA
(snapping)
We have to-
(beat gathers herself)
I’m not your enemy Conor I’m here
to help your mother

CONOR
I know why you’re here

He grabs a cloth and starts furiously wiping the counter
Grandma snatches the cloth out of his hand To his surprise
he sees that her hands are shaking

GRANDMA
I’m here because 12-year-old boys
shouldn’t be wiping down counters
without being asked to first

ConOR
Were you going to do it

GRANDMA
Less of your cheek-

CONOR
She’s always sick after the
treatments She’ll be better
tomorrow And then you can go home

Grandma doesn’t answer just rubs her face then her arms
keeping strong emotions in check This is a woman whose
daughter may be dying after all

Conor is so unsettled he grabs another cloth and starts on
the counter again

GRANDMA
(barely controlled)
She’1l seem better tomorrow But
she won’t be

Conor doesn’t like this at all

CONOR
Yes she will “You go through the
rough stuff but it’s for a good
reason” That’s what she says

Grandma clearly wants to say much more but can’t or won’t

GRANDMA
You need to talk to her about this
(to herself)
She needs to talk about this with

you
CONOR
Talk to me about what
GRANDMA
(beat)

About you coming to live with me

There the die is cast Conor is furious

CONOR
I’m never coming to live with you

GRANDMA
Conor listen to me if your mother-

CONOR
There’s no if She’1ll feel better
and then you can leave-

GRANDMA
Conor-

A panicked call from the sitting room

Mum (0S)
(distressed)
Ma Mum

A look of heartbreaking terror crosses Grandma’s face as she
bolts almost comically fast out of the kitchen to her
daughter Conor follows glancing out the window where the
tree is still a tree-

Conor enters the sitting room Grandma is helping Mum up from
the floor Mum is in serious pain

Mum
(gestures to mantel)
I need the Oromorph-

GRANDMA
(looking)
Which one

Conor steps forward points

ConOR
That one For the stabbing pains

Quick grim beat for Grandma and Mum that Conor knows this
then Grandma grabs a LIQUID PAINKILLER from the mantelpiece
and starts to dose her daughter

Mum pants as she swallows it trying to catch her breath
ride out the pain Grandma rubs her back

GranDMA
It’s okay darling it’s okay shh
shh shh

Grandma looks up at Conor her face set and unreadable

InT conor’s sitting room - that evening 32

Grandma sets a meal heavy on the celery down in front of
Conor and his Mum who looks much more tired They eat on
trays in the sitting room

Mum
A tray where joy goes to die

GraNDMA
It’s good for you

MUM
When in history has that ever
worked

Grandma’s not listening She’s looking back at the projector

GRANDMA
Are you just going to leave that
hunk of junk in the middle of the
sitting room

MUM
It’s not a hunk of junk Dad loved
it

Grandma snorts a little dismissively

MUM (CONTD)
But all those classics King Kong
Frankenstein-

GRANDMA

When exactly do you think I was
born I was 18 years old when Star
Wars came out I have about as much
interest in boring old films as
Conor probably does

(to Conor)
Right

ConoR
(quietly)
King Kong was pretty good

GRANDMA
(shaking her head to Mum)
You and your father Always chasing
butterflies

Mum
Yeah well you were always there
to remind us we had chores to do

GRANDMA
(stung)
And made sure there was food on the
table

Mum holds up limp celery giggling with Conor Grandma sees

GranDMA (CONT’D)

Shall I just make you ice cream
sundaes that you’1l throw back up

(grabs pizza box still

there from before)
Or order pizza that’1l make sure
youve only got empty calories to
face more chemo with

Mum
What’s wrong with food that makes
me happy Can’t you let me enjoy
life a bit

GRANDMA
(shocked)
Yes I want you to enjoy it fora
long long time

MUM
(warning her about Conor)
Ma-—

GRANDMA
Why is it so bad that I’d like you
to take care of yourself

MUM
I don’t know is it so hard to
remember I’m a grown woman and can
make those decisions for myself

GRANDMA

(shaking her head)
The irony of it No one wants to be
like their parents but we all
expect our kids to be exactly like
us

(almost to herself)
No wonder it’s always so hard

Mum
(mumbles )
Daddy liked pizza

This really hurts Grandma stands gathering the trays even
if they aren’t finished

Mum (CONT’D)
(regretful)
Ma I’m-

Grandma disappears into the kitchen Mum looks at Conor and
sighs

ConOR

GraNDMA

best not to

She hands him a last pillow

GraNDMA (CONTD)
Our conversation isn’t over young

She gives him a “to be continued” look and shuts the door

ConOR
(quietly)
Oh yes it is

Fade to bLACK

Sounds fade up

Nightmare sounds wind roaring screaming rising again in
crescendo to

InT conor’S SITTING ROOM - that night 34

Conor sits up sweating panting again The sitting room is
dark Conor calms himself where he sleeps on the settee

He looks around the dim untidy room We can see plenty of
get well cards on the shelves plus tumbles of smart
chicklit his mum’s CD collection (90s rave Massive Attack
Blur) some of her drawings

Conor glances impatiently at the clock display on the DVD
player It clicks over from 1206 to 1207

A breeze tousles Conor’s hair He listens for the Monster
And listens

And listens

Nothing The clock ticks over to 1208 He sees a pen rolling
across the top of the DVD player Other things including his

shoe start rolling towards the kitchen

Conor gets to his feet blanket wrapped around him He goes

Conor exits into his back garden The Monster towers over him
again

MonsteR
It is time for me to tell you the

ConOR
(disgusted)
What good does that do me I don’t
need a story-
(looks up to his bedroom)
I need a bus ticket for my grandma

MONSTER
(more strongly)
It is time for me to tell you the
first tale-

Conor turns away

MonSTER (CONTD)
Where do you think you’re going I
will be listened to I have been
alive as long as this land and you
will-

CONOR
(turns back angry)
What do you know about anything

MONSTER
I know about you Conor O“Malley

CONOR
No you don’t If you did you’d
know I don’t have time to listen to
stupid stories from a stupid tree
that isn’t even real

MONSTER
Were the leaves on your floor real
Were the berries

CONOR
Who cares if they were They were
berries Ohhh so scary save me
from the berries

MONSTER
How strange The words you say tell
me you are scared of the berries
but your actions suggests
otherwise

CONOR
You’re as old as the land and
you’ve never heard of sarcasm

The monster doesn’t know how to answer that

ConOR (CONT’D)
(giving up)
Never mind I saw you when I was
talking to my grandma and I
thought

MonsteR
You thought I came to topple your
enemies Slay your dragons

Conor frowns This is obviously true

ConOR
Or at least help me with my
grandmother But all you want to do
is tell me stupid stories

MONSTER
Stories of how I toppled enemies
Stories of how I slew dragons

The Monster leans down until its face is close to Conor’s

MONSTER (CONTD)
Let me tell you a tale of when I
came walking Let me tell you of
the end of a wicked queen and how I
made sure she was never seen again

The Monster looks up to Conor’s bedroom where grandma
sleeps Conor follows his gaze

ConOR
Go on then

The Monster grins his evil grin The Monster puts his hands
on the ground Branches leaves twigs start to twine around
Conor A branch with leaves covers Conor’s eyes

MONSTER

CONOR
Nothing There are leaves in the
way

MONSTER

see

BlaCKNESS conor’s vision - conTINUOUS 36

We cut to blackness what Conor is seeing There’s nothing
Then there’s a small light

CONOR
I see a spark

MONSTER
Yes And

The spark seems reflected on water

CONOR
No it’s water It’s watercolour

MONSTER
Keep looking

A world starts to appear the light on the water becomes the
sun reflected on a brook Pull out to see that - though the
world is an abstract water-colour-like landscape we can
recognise the hilltop behind Conor’s house with a younger
smaller yew tree on it

ConOR
Whoa

MonSTER
Whoa indeed

We zoom up to

He tries to step back from the Monster in dawning fright

ConOR (CONT’D)
You really are a monster

MONSTER
I never said she killed the

ExT conor’s back GARDEN - nighT - conTINUOUS 56

Conor watches in shock as the scene fades on the hilltop the
Monster lowering his hands

Conor
You said he was surprised when he
woke up

MonstER

He was merely acting out a
pantomime should anyone be
watching

CONOR
But but you said he asked you
for help and you gave it

MoNSTER
I only said he told me enough to
make me come walking I never said
I came to help him

CONOR
What did he say then

MONSTER
He said it was for the good of the
kingdom That the queen was in
fact a witch too powerful to
topple on his own so he killed the
Farmer’s Daughter to get the fury
of the people behind him Just as
the King’s sons had died in battle
the Farmer’s Daughter had given her
life to a greater good

ConOR
That’s a load of crap

MONSTER

The justifications of men who kill
should always be heard with
scepticism

ConOR
Did he ever get caught

MONSTER
He became a much beloved king who
ruled happily until the end of his
long days

Conor unhappily considers all this

CONOR
So the good prince was a murderer
and the evil queen wasn’t a witch
after all

The Monster begins to rumble louder and louder until we
realise it’s laughing a laugh that shakes the earth
spooking owls from their perches causing leaves to fall

MonSTER
(calming some)
No the Queen most certainly was a
witch and could well have been on
her way to great evil Who can say

ConOR
Why’d you save her then

MonSTER
Because what she was not was a
murderer She hadn’t poisoned the
king He had merely grown old

ConOR
I don’t get it Who’s the good guy
here

MONSTER

There is not always a good guy Nor
is there always a bad one Most
people are somewhere inbetween

CoNOR
That’s a terrible story And a
cheat

MONSTER

It’s a true story Many things that
are true feel like a cheat
Kingdoms get the princes they
deserve farmer’s daughters die for
no reason and sometimes witches
merit saving Quite often
actually You’d be surprised

Conor glances unhappily up to his bedroom window again

CONOR
So how is that supposed to save me
from her

MONSTER (0S)
It is not her you need saving from

Conor turns back to the Monster but he’s gone On the
hilltop the yew tree is back in place as if nothing had
happened Which is annoying

ExT pavement CONVERSATION WITH LILY - the nexXT DAY 57

Conor stops and his anger backs Lily into a nearby wall

ConoR
I’m not sorry and I don’t forgive
you

LILY

My mum said we need to make
allowances for you but I just
think you’re acting like a jerk-

CONOR

Harry raises a fist as if to strike Conor Again Conor

SKETCHPAD

MuM
Hi sweetheart Come sit

He sits down next to her on the bed She’s sketching the yew
tree The drawing is half-finished but really excellent

Mum (CONT’D)
(wo turning)
Yew trees are amazing you know
Live for thousands of years And
they’re always planted in
churchyards because the-

ConOR
(finishes heard it a
thousand times)
-berries are poisonous so they have
to be kept away from cows and
stuff

MUM
No that’s just the official
version The real reason is that
yew trees dig their roots down into
the graves and take all the things
the dead wish they could have said
and spread them into the world
through their leaves

CONOR
(skeptical)
Uh-huh

Mum turns and smiles at him exhausted setting down the half-
finished sketch Conor gives a horrified look at the wig on
her head She laughs

MUM
I know Tina Turner If she was
from Sheffield

CONOR
I don’t really know who that is

Ext ChurCHYARD HILLTOP conor’s house - day 65A

Mum tugs the wig off laughing tying a scarf on her head
They both look at the tree

Mum starts stroking his hair

ConOR
Why am I going to stay with
Grandma Are you going back to
hospital

Mum
(sighs lovingly)
Weve been here before sweetheart
I feel really bad and I go in and
they take care of it

CONOR
Then why is dad coming

Mum pauses in the hair stroking but picks right back up

MUM
Aren’t you excited

CONOR
Grandma doesn’t seem too happy

MUM
(snorts)
Well you know how she feels about
your father Don’t listen to her

Beat silence Conor braces himself

CONOR
There’s something else isn’t
there

Mum quickly forcefully cuts off his worry

He does

MuM
Look at me son

Mum (CONT’D)
The latest treatment’s not doing
what it’s supposed to So they’re
going to adjust it try something
else That’s all

ConoR
That’s all

MUM
(nodding)
That’s all There’s lots more they
can do It’s normal Don’t worry

CONOR
Youre sure

MUM
I’m sure

CONOR
Because You could tell me you
know

And here’s the moment where she could tell him everything
But she can’t not yet

MUM

I remember when you were a little
baby and it was just the two of
us And you’d get like a fever or
something I used to get so scared
I was really really young - only
six years older than you if you
can believe it - and this was a
time when things werent going so
great Your dad was gone and I
wasn°t speaking to your Grandma
And I kept thinking What if I get
this wrong It“d be the middle of
the night and I wouldnt know what
to do I°d have no one to ask no
one to lean on And do you know
what I’d always do I’d look into
your eyes into your little baby
eyes and I’d say “We’re a team
me and you We’re in this
together” And I’d still be scared
but it didn’t matter so much
anymore Because you were counting
on me and that was the only thing
that mattered

(rubs his head)
Still is

She leans up puts an arm around him her head on his
shoulder They both look out at the tree

MUM (CONT’D)
I’1l bet that old tree will keep an
eye on the house for us while
you’re at your grandma’s

Conor’s expression is priceless His mum grabs him and turns
him to her faux-serious
Mum (CONT’D)
But for God’s sake whatever you
do don’t touch your grandmother’s
clock

Cut TO

66-66A EXTInT Grandma’s DRIVEWAYsitting room - days later 66-66A

The face of Grandma’s prize grandfather clock It’s against
the wall of a pristine sitting room every surface clean and
museum-like including glass display cases with figurines
low bookcases porcelain knickknacks The polar opposite of
Conor’s warmly untidy house Conor leans on the doorframe

Grandma very carefully SETS HER WRISTWATCH by the clock (not
vice versa)

GranDMA
(looking at clock)
Ive got a house to show I’m
trusting you here alone until your
dad shows up

Conor
I’m not five years old

GRANDMA

(ignores this finishes

with watch)
This is the correct time Not the
one on your computer or even the
one on the news Right here I
almost got this on Antiques
Roadshow once It belong to my
mother - your grear-grandmother
Perfect time keeping for over a
hundred years

Conor rolls his eyes A VERY old story She brushes past him

Int grandma’s front hallway - conTINUOUS 67

She glides smoothly to a mirror checking how she looks On
the wall we might notice some pictures of her and her
family including one of her with CONOR’S GRANDFATHER played
by the same actor as the Monster

GrandMA
Pick up your rucksack please
Don’t want your father to think I’m
keeping you in a pigsty

ConOR
(muttering)
Not much chance of that

His Grandma opens a front closet puts on a coat

GrandMA
Now Conor when you go to the
hospital your father may not
notice how tired your mum’s been
getting okay So we’re going to
have to make sure he doesn’t
overstay his welcome

Final check in the mirror

GranDMA (CONT’D)
(to herself)
Not that that’s historically been a
problem

She gives one last appraising look at Conor

Grandma (CONT’D)
If you get hungry before your dad
gets here there’s steamed broccoli
in the fridge No eggs You’ve
already had eggs twice this week
(frowns sighs)
Be good

And lets herself out

InT granDMA’S Kitchen - moments LATER 68

Montage as Conor looks around his Grandma’s house for
something to do First in her spotless kitchen cupboards
full of nothing a boy might like to eat

InT grandma’s kiTCHEN - momENTS LATER

Conor now stands on the counter-top digging deep into a
cupboard He finds a packet of cookies

CONOR
Get in

InT grandma’s TV room - momentS LATER 70

Conor in a sterile TV room eating the cookies Only dull
channels (BBC Living) are available Every channel he wants
to watch blocked by a PIN code

InT grandma’s guEST ROOM - momENTS LATER 71

Conor opens the door to his temporary bedroom His suitcase
is open clothes removed but the room is bright white
pictures of sailboats on the wall It could be a hotel room

EXT grandma’s back garden - momentS LATER 72
Conor steps out into his Grandma’s back garden which has no
green space at all just stone paths sheds and an office
she’s had built in the back

No hilltop on the horizon No tree to be seen anywhere

InT grandma’s CORRIDOR upstairs - momenTS LATER 73

Conor climbs the steep steps up to the door of Grandma’s loft
conversion It’s locked He can’t believe it

He tries to look through the keyhole but can only see
glimpses of a room inside

Then Conor JUMPS at the sound of the DOORBELL He hurries
down the stairs to

InT granDMA’S FRONT HALLWAY - conTINUOUS

the front door He opens it on HIS DAD late thirties
handsome slightly too boyish for his own good

Conor’s gives him a genuinely free smile

InT CHINESE Restaurant - later that EVENING

Conor and his Dad sit at a table waiting for their food Dad
has a glass of RED WINE Conor a clear soft drink Dad isn’t

quite sure how to talk to this son he doesn’t see very often
His accent is HALF-IRISHHALF-AMERICAN

DAD

How you hanging in there champ
ConOR

“Champ”
DAD

Sorry America is almost a whole
different language

Dad fidgets with his wine glass Conor drums
chopsticks

Dad (CONTD)
Your mom seemed pretty good
tonight A real fighter that one

Conor shrugs

He stops

DAD (CONTD)
You look tired Con How are you
holding up

ConOR
That’s like the eight hundredth
time you’ve asked me that

DAD
Sorry

CONOR
I’m fine Mum’s on this new
medicine It’1l make her better
Why is everyone acting like
she’s

Takes a drink

DAD
“Everyone”

CONOR

lightly with his

Grandma Wants me to come live with

her

DAD
You mean when your mum-
CONOR
If

DAD
(takes the correction)
If your mum

CONOR
But that’s not going to happen

DAD
Still You’re going to need to be
brave for her You’re going to need
to be real real brave

CONOR
You talk like American television

Dad takes this in good humour

DAD
Your sister’s doing well Almost
sitting up by herself

CONOR
Half-sister

DAD
I can’t wait for you to meet her
I’ve been talking to your grandma
about getting you out to LA

Conor looks up surprised and with nascent hope

ConOR
You want me to come to LA

DAD
Absolutely Would you like that I
was thinking maybe over Christmas
so we can get you back in time for

school
Dad smiles pleased he’s connected Then he blows
CONOR
(suspicious)
But you mean just for a

visit then

DAD
Yeah it’ll be great

it

Beat as he realizes that’s not what Conor was hoping for

CONOR
I don’t want to live with Grandma
It’s an old lady’s house

(MORE)

CONOR (CONTD)
You can’t touch anything or sit
anywhere and you can’t leave a mess
for even two seconds

DAD
We can talk to her about that I’m
sure there are plenty of ways to
make you comfortable-

CONOR
I don’t want to be comfortable I
want my own room in my own house

DAD
(wincing)
You wouldn’t have that in America
We barely have room for the three
of us Besides your school is
here your life is here It’d be
unfair to take you out of it

CONOR
Unfair to who

DAD
(sighing)
This is what I meant When I said
you were going to have to be brave

conor
(pouring cold water)

Can we talk about the visit when

mum gets better

Dad resigned can’t find the strength to talk to Conor
honestly Gives in

DAD
Of course champ That’s exactly
what we’ll do

A WAITRESS sets their meals down in front of them Neither
them make a move to eat

of

ExT Grandma’s House - later that EVENING 76

Conor and his Dad pull up outside his Grandma’s house in his
father’s rental car

Dad
Doesn’t look like your Grandma’s
home yet

ConOR

She sometimes goes back to the
hospital after I go to bed The
nurses let her sleep in a chair

DAD
Your Grandma may not like me much
but that doesn’t mean she’s a bad

lady

CONOR
She says you’re all start and no
finish

DAD

(laughs wounded)
That might be true

CONOR
How long are you here for

DAD
As long as I can

CONOR
How much is that

DAD

(sighing)
We don’t have a ton of money And
Americans don’t get much holiday

CONOR
You’re not American

DAD
But I live there now You’re the
one who made fun of my accent all
night

CONOR
Why did you come then

DAD
Because your Mum asked me to

Beat as seriousness of this is absorbed
Dad (CONT’D)
Ill come back though You know
when I need to And you’1l visit us
at Christmas

ConOR
In your cramped house where
there’s no room for me

DAD
Conor-

CONOR
(again)
Why did you come

Dad doesn’t answer Reaches out to put a hand
shoulder but Conor avoids it and gets out of

DAD
(through open door)
Conor wait I’1l see you tomorrow
yeah There’s still plenty of time

on Conors
the car

Conor doesn’t really believe this He shuts the car door

INT GRANDMA’S SITTING ROOM - EVENING - MOMENTS LATER 77

We hear Conor come in the front door He enters the sitting
room slumping down unhappily on the settee

He takes off his coat but ends up fighting with the sleeve
He stands getting frustrated eventually throwing the coat
to the floor He stands there breathing on the verge of
letting all his bottled up anger go

Almost absentmindedly he kicks his rucksack (set against the
settee) It spills open dumping his sketchpad which opens
at a drawing of the swallowing hole and the face looking
back Enraged he tears the picture out and rips it in two
throwing the pieces into the sitting room

He’s still angry and it’s growing not abating It feels
strangely good He flexes his fists anger still fizzing
Suddenly BONG BONG The precious CLOCK starts striking the
9 oclock hour

Conor approaches it It chimes away the pendulum swinging
Still edgy Conor grabs it mid-swing The bongs continue but
the clock makes a groaning sound

Holding the pendulum in place Conor starts pushing the dials
of the clock around They resist at first but he pushes them
harder and faster until they’re spinning around the face
The BONGs groan alarmingly as he passes each hour but he
keeps going faster and faster until-

SNAP The second hand breaks in two in his grip

Oh no Conor comes to his senses realises what he’s done
The clock is broken really broken frozen in place

He’s doomed and so horrified he doesn’t register that the
now non-moving hands have stopped at 1207

MonSTER (0S)
As destruction goes this is
remarkably pitiful

Conor turns and sees that somehow impossibly the Monster is
in his Grandma’s sitting room It fills up all available
space folding its massive form into every corner its head
bumping the ceiling

Conor looks back at the clock frantic now
MONSTER (CONTD)
Now I have come to tell you the

second tale

Conor makes an exasperated sound He’s got bigger things to
worry about

ConOR
Is it as bad as the last one

MONSTER
It ends in proper destruction if
that’s what you mean

This has Conor’s attention somewhat but he shakes his head

ConOR
No I can’t I-

MonSTER
It’s about a man who thought only
of himself A man who wasn’t
generous like he should have been

The Monster leans forward

MonSTER (CONTD)
A man who gets punished very badly
indeed

ConOR
(intrigued skeptical)
Stories aren’t real though They
don’t help anything

MonSTER
Stories are wild creatures Conor
OMalley When you let them loose
who knows what havoc they might
wreak

Another beat until

ConOR
I’m listening

MONSTER
Good

The Monster’s branches surround Conor again leaves covering
his eyes and we’re-

ExT Second Tale landscape - daY - continuous 78

-flying over far more colourful landscape than before but
this time it’s GREEN and VERDANT and more realistic like an
oil painting

MonSTER (vO)
One hundred and fifty years ago the
world was becoming industrialized

The green ends as we plunge through the trees into “industry”
on the valley floor black factories belching smoke and
fumes scraggly silhouettes of crows and trodden-down
workers fish jumping in polluted rivers

Monster (vO)
But there was still green if you
knew where to look

We come out the other side to a surprisingly quiet GREEN
HILLSIDE We turn and see that Conor and the Monster are now
standing in the landscape their figures realistic not
stylised as the Monster draws Conor’s attention to

ANGLE ON The APOTHECARY walking up the hillside A more
realistic figure than the first tale but still stylized

Monster (VO)
His name is not important The
villagers only ever called him The
Apothecary

Conor (VO)
The what

MONSTER (VO)
The Apothecary

CONOR (VO)
The what

MonSTER (vO)
An old-fashioned named for
pharmacist or chemist

CONOR (v0O)
Oh Why didn’t you just say

The Apothecary digs up roots and picks leaves and herbs

MONSTER (vO)
The Apothecary dealt in the old
ways of medicine Herbs and roots
Concoctions brewed from berries and
leaves

CONOR (vO)
Dad’s new wife does that She owns
a shop that sells crystals

MONSTER (VO)
It is not remotely the same

The Apothecary reaches the edge of a wood and sees it
drastically cut back for the industry below

MonSTER (vO)
The Apothecary had dedicated his
life to healing But the world was
changing He grew resentful and
unforgiving

ExT second tale village - day - conTINUOUS 79

The Apothecary peddles his wares to various villagers We get
a sense of bad-tempers and bitterness

MONSTER (vO)
People in the valley stopped
seeking him out preferring modern
medicine Which only made him more
bitter

The Apothecary doors slamming against him slouches off
alone We pull back across the valley to

EXT second tale HILLTOP fringe - DAY - conTINUOUS 80

-the same hilltop as behind Conor’s house but this time
there is a parsonage beside the yew tree and the beginnings
of a church being built Conor and the Monster stand off to
one side in the landscape again

MonSTER
In the Apothecary’s village there
also lived a parson-

ConOR
This is the hill where you live
(on the 2nd yew tree)
That’s you

MONSTER
Yes On the parsonage grounds there
also grew a yew tree

Two small figures run out playfully from the parsonage
chasing each other running up a path away from us towards
the yew tree in the graveyard

MONSTER (CONTD)
The parson had two daughters who
were the light of his life

CONOR
I’1l bet he had room for them in
his house

We move forward and CLOSE ON
ExT secOND TALE HILLTOP - DAY - conTINUOUS
The Apothecary watching the yew tree intently

Monster (VO)
Now the Apothecary wanted the
parson’s yew tree very badly

Conor (vO)
He did Why

Monster (vO)

(surprised)
The yew tree is the most important
of all the healing trees Its
berries its bark they burn and
twist with life It can cure almost
any ailment if mixed by the right
apothecary of course

ConOR (vO)
(thinking)
Really

The Apothecary looks enviously at the tree

MonsTEr (VO)
In order to use the tree though
the Apothecary would have to cut it
down and this the Parson would not
allow

The PARSON comes out warningly the Apothecary leaves

MONSTER (VO)
The Parson was not an unkind man
He wanted the best for his
congregation wanted to take them
out of the dark ages of
superstition and witchery

We zoom in on the Parson figure and he’s suddenly

82 InT second tale pulpit - daY - conTINUOUS 82
-preaching to his congregation

MonSTER (VO)
He preached against the
Apothecary’s use of the old ways
and the Apothecary’s foul temper
and greed made certain those
sermons fell on eager ears

We pull out from the pulpit through a celebratory
congregation out of the CHURCH to

ExT second tale countryside - day - continuous

The Apothecary slinking away We keep pulling back to

ExT seCOND TALE HILLTOP - night - conTINUOUS 84
The parsonage is now a drab and grey place

MonSTER (VO)
But then the parson’s daughters
were struck by a terrible sickness

Figures move in the windows of the parsonage Night passes

MonSTER (VO)
Nothing the parson did helped No
prayer no cure from the more
modern doctors nothing made them
better There was no choice but to
approach the Apothecary

The Parson steps sadly out onto his doorstep

ExT

seconD TALE apothecary’s hovel - night - conTINUOUS 85

Parson is on his knees before the Apothecary in front of
Apothecary’s hovel

MonSTER (vO)
“Will you not help my daughters”
the Parson begged “Will you not
save two innocent girls”

Apothecary stands over the Parson haughtily

MONSTER (VO)
“Why should I” said the
Apothecary “You have driven away
my business with your preachings
and you have refused me the yew
tree my best source of healing”

Apothecary walks away The Parson chases him

MonSTER (VO)
“You may have the yew tree” said
the Parson “I will preach sermons
in your favour I will do anything
if you would only save my
daughters”

Apothecary stops surprised

MonSTER (VO)
“You would give up everything you
believed in” said the Apothecary
“Tf it would save them” said the
Parson “I would give up
everything”

Apothecary turns and enters his house
MONSTER (vO)
“Then there is nothing I can do to
help you” said the Apothecary
Apothecary’s door closes on the Parson
ConOR (vO)

(shocked)
What

We pull back from the Apothecary’s hovel to

86 ExT seconD TALE HILLTOP (TBC YARD) - day - conTINUOUS 86

the parsonage where the Parson and his wife stand over
two new graves

MonSTER (vO)
The very next day both of the
parson’s daughters died

ConOR (VO)
WHAT

MONSTER (VO)
And that night I came walking

ExT second tale hilltop fringe (STUDIO) - night - continudis
Conor and the Monster still watching the tale

CONOR
Good He deserves all the
punishment he gets

MONSTER
Indeed It was shortly after
midnight that I tore the Parson’s
home from its very foundations

The Monster shockingly STEPS INTO THE TALE becoming sytlized
along with it Conor watches him walk down the path to the
Parson’s house

CoNOR
(shocked)
The Parson

The Monster starts destroying the parsonage tearing off its
roof and flinging it down the hill sending the PARSON and
HIS WIFE fleeing in terror

Conor is outraged

ConoR (CONT’D)
What are you doing

The Monster knocks down a wall

MONSTER
When times were easy the Parson
nearly destroyed the Apothecary
with his belifs But when his
daughters were sick he was willing
to sacrifice every belief to save
them

CONOR
So So would everybody What did
you expect him to do

MONSTER
I would have expected him to give
the Apothecary the yew tree when he
first asked

ConOR
(surprised)
You’d have let yourself be killed

The Monster destroys another bit of the parsonage
MONSTER

It would have saved many lives
including the Parson’s daughters

Conor
But the Apothecary was evil

MONSTER
He was greedy and rude but he was
still a healer The Parson What
was he A man who thought he
believed but was actually too weak
to hold on to anything worth
believing in

The Monster topples a chimney

MONSTER (CONTD)
Belief is half of all healing
Belief in the cure belief in the
future that awaits

(to Conor)

Your belief is valuable so you
must be careful where you put it
And in whom

Beat as the Monster gets a mischievous look

MONSTER (CONTD)
Tell me Conor O’Malley What shall
I destroy next

ConOR
(beat bewildered)
What

The Monster kicks down a wall
MONSTER
It is most satisfying I assure
you Come on Tell me

Conor hesitates still unsure

MonSTER (CONTD)
What should I destroy I await your
command

Conor hesitates again

ConOR
(confused)
Snap the chimney

MONSTER
The chimney

The Monster unhesitatingly knocks over what remains of the
fireplace Conor steps closer That felt interesting

MoNSTER (CONT’D)
Next

ConOR
Throw away their beds

MONSTER
The beds

The Monster reaches into the house and flings the beds nearly
to the horizon Conor begins to feel liberated

CONOR
Smash their furniture

The Monster stomps on the parsonage’s furniture

CONOR (CONT’D)
Break their windows

The Monster doesn’t but steps back and gestures to the
window as if in invitation

MoNSTER
Windows Break them yourself come
on

Conor gets an excited smile and picks up a large fallen
branch and RUNS DOWN THE PATH TO THE PARSONAGE turning into
a STYLIZED VERSION OF HIMSELF joining the destruction

We remain VERY CLOSE on Conor as he smashes one window and
then another his face blazing with excitement and fury

MoNSTER (CONTD)
Harder Harder Conor OMalley
Come on That’s it That’s it Yes
Hard as steel Conor O’Malley
Feels good doesn’t it Again

But the lights are slowly changing darkening as he continues
smashing the landscape and Conor becoming less stylized

Until he takes one last ferocious swing flinging the branch
away with a cry spinning around

InT granDMA’S SITTING ROOM - nighT - conTINUOUS 88
-he’s back in his Grandma’s sitting room

Where he’s destroyed nearly everything The settee is in
pieces the side tables broken the glass display cabinets
shattered papers strewn from the bookcase

Worst is the CLOCK Knocked over and broken into pieces
almost beyond recognition

Conor is ankle-deep in rubble

ConOR
Oh no No no no

And then almost before he can compute it there’s worse his
Grandma’s car pulls up outside

He freezes The lights from her car shine behind the sitting
room curtains then turn off He hears her door open

There’s nowhere for him to run not a single thing he can do
except follow the sound of her coming up the front steps
turning her key in the lock coming in through the front
door down the hallway and-

She enters her sitting room Before she registers anything
her unguarded face is serious and worried

But then she looks up

GRANDMA
What-

She looks slowly around the room her face in ever-growing
horror her mouth open She leans down and picks up a piece
of her beloved clock

We wait for the apocalypse But then her face changes She
puts a palm over her mouth as if to try and stop sound from
coming out Then she slaps a second hand over it

But she can’t help it A horrible anguished keening escapes
from her And again This is much worse than her being angry

CONOR
(wary)
Grandma

Grandma takes her hands away from her mouth and she screams
It’s wordless and furious She screams again stepping into

the sitting room Conor thinks she might going to attack him
and surprisingly puts up his fists ready to fight-

But she heads for the one last remaining display cabinet
puts her hands behind it and takes one two three pushes to
send it crashing to the ground

She leans forward gasping ragged her face broken with
anguish
Then she leaves the sitting room without another word

Conor stands there beyond shocked

89-89A InT grandma’s DRIVEWAYupstairs - momenTS LATER 89-89A

Conor slowly approaches his Grandma’s loft (the locked one)
The light is on underneath the door He can hear her in
there weeping He stays outside not knowing what to do

InT grandma’s guest room - the next morning 90

Conor lies awake in bed It’s the morning after It looks
like he hasn’t slept He hears footsteps around the house
then the front door slamming He gets up

InT grandma’s stairwell - momentS LATER 91

Conor comes slowly down the stairway but the house seems to
be empty He glances in the sitting room Someone has made a
futile effort to clean it a bit He heads into

InT grandma’s kitchen - conTINUOUS 92
Where to his astonishment Dad is cooking breakfast

Dad
I know you like ‘em scrambled

ConoR
What are you doing here

DAD
What do you think

He motions for Conor to sit at the table then dishes up two
plates sets one in front of Conor and sits down himself
They eat in silence Conor just playing at his food

Dad (CONT’D)
That was quite a mess you made

Conor says nothing

DAD (CONTD)
She called me this morning Very
very early
(beat it’s not what we
expect)
Your mum’s taken a turn Conor
Your Grandma’s gone to hospital

Conor looks up

DAD (CONTD)
We agreed I would drop you off at
school-

ConOR
School I want to see mum

DAD
It’s no place for a kid right now
Conor We’ll see how the day goes
and maybe we can visit for a little
while this afternoon

Conor looks down at his breakfast no longer hungry

DaD (CONTD)
Hey remember what I said about you
being brave Well now’s the time
you have to do it Con
(nods to sitting room
thoughtful)
I can see how upset you are

ConOR
I didn’t mean to I don’t know what
happened

DAD
Worse things happen at sea

ConOR
What do you mean Aren’t you going
to punish me

DaD
(sighing)
What could possibly be the point of
that Con

Conor looks surprised perhaps even displeased Dad watches
him look distraught

Dad (CONT’D)
You know what Maybe you don’t have
to go to school today

EXT football pitch (AMUSEMENT PARK) - day - later 93

Conor and his Dad kick a football around serious at first
but then Conor starts to lighten up at his father’s teasing
They laugh at their mistakes cheer good moves It’s a
montage of joy a glimpse of the boy Conor actually is Dad
is quite boyish too Dad scores a goal and celebrates like a
kid hands over head while Conor laughs

Dad watches this closely like he’s just realized that the
boy smiling before him is his son

EXT carpark (AMUSEMENT PARK) - day - later 94

Conor sits in his Dad’s car while Dad is on a mobile phone
outside We can’t hear Dad but he doesn’t look very happy
He hangs up frustrated gets back in the car

ConoR
Is mum okay

DaD
(blinks )
That was your stepmom back in LA
And yeah everything’s fine Now
weve got some cleaning up to do

Conor doesn’t believe him as they pull away

InT graNDMA’S SITTING ROOM - lATER
Conor and Dad put broken things into bin liners

Dad
(amazed)
Gotta say Champ this is really
just amazingly thorough

Conor doesn’t answer just puts more trash in a bin liner
sees something picks it up It’s the torn image of his
nightmare drawing He’s mesmerised by it

Dad (CONTD)
Ooh buried treasure

Conor turns to his father He’s holding some old homemade
DVDs He reads through the labels

DAD (CONTD)
It’s all those old home movies your
mum used to send to me of you when
I moved away Guess your grandma
got copies too

He carefully sets them on the mantelpiece

ConOR

(shy)
Why did you move away

Dad sighs

DAD
You have no idea how young we were
Con We had all these dreams big
foolish ones that your grandma
didn’t approve of And then we
changed

CONOR
(beat taking the blame)
Because mum got pregnant with me

DAD

(comforting)
Hey hey hey You were only ever
good news Your mum never regretted
having you I know that for a fact

(rueful smile)
Because she’s always saying how
much she regretted marrying me

CONOR
Why did she marry you then

He

DAD

My devilish good looks No we had
a lot in common Our lives our
future Your mum was amazing Still
is

(sighing)
But we grew apart Your Grandma was
kind of supporting us then and
insisting we be more practical and
I I was maybe less amazing than
I should have been We were just so
young Too young

CONOR
You didn’t get happily ever after

DAD
That’s life though Most of us
just get messily ever after

Dad sees Conor’s torn drawing and picks it up impressed

Dad (CONT’D)
Even I’m happy you take after her
(beat)

looking at him He doesn’t approach her

The hospital room DOOR opens and a LAWYER steps out putting
away some papers that Conor’s parents have clearly just
signed DAD sees the Lawyer out the door holds up a “one
second” finger to Conor Closes the door

Grandma stands as the Lawyer approaches They clearly have
business together Conor watches them go Then he hears
voices arguing within the hospital room

they see Conor and stop looking at him guiltily

MuM
Hey there

The room is filled with get-well cards and flowers The anger
on his Mum’s face is quickly hidden behind an exhausted
smile She’s clearly much sicker and weaker Her voice is
heavier as with a chest infection

Conor pauses before entering suspicious He holds out the
coffee to his Dad who takes it

ConoR
Why is everyone yelling

Mum gives Dad a look like “you tell him”

DAD
I’ve got some bad news Con I have
to fly back tomorrow

CONOR
The day after tomorrow Why

Dad
Remember when your step-mum called
The baby’s sick Probably nothing
serious but Stephanie went a bit
crazy and took her to hospital

He falters

CONOR
Are you coming back

DAD
(firmly)
Yes Yes I am Sunday after next
so not even two weeks
(beat)
Your grandma’s paying for the
ticket Which is fun

Mum laughs despite herself She makes eyes for Dad to leave

DaD (CONTD)
I’m going to see about finding some
food You want anything sport

ConOR
I want you to stop calling me
“sport”

Dad laughs Mum laughs too then coughs It sounds ugly Dad
makes his exit to let them talk

Mum pats the bed for him to sit Conor does She ruffles his

hair

He notices the tubes and bruises on her arm

Mum
I know Not my favourite way to
spend a day either

ConOR
Are you okay What happened this
morning

Mum

I had a bit of a bad reaction
sweetheart Not what they were
hoping for

Here it is Here’s the bad news But once again-

Beat as perhaps something important’s been left unsaid

MUM (CONTD)
(forced brightness)
But there’s one more thing they’re
going to try a medicine that’s had
some good results

ConoR
Why didn’t they try it before

Mum
Well this is something you take
when the normal stuff hasn’t worked
the way they want it to

CONOR
(carefully)
Does that mean it’s too late

MUM
(quickly firmly)
No Conor Don’t think that It’s
not too late It’s never too late

CONOR
Are you sure

MUM
(smiling)
I believe every word I say

CONOR
(to himself)
“Belief is half of healing”

MUM
(surprised)
Well yeah I suppose it is

plays with his hair again

Mum

Mum (CONT’D)
Oh and here’s something You know
that tree behind our house I’m
always prattling on about

Conor freezes comically Mum coughs again ugly leans back
on the bed

MUM (CONTD)
Well if you can believe it this
drug is actually made from trees
like that

ConOR
It is

MuM
Yeah I know All this time we
could have just chopped the damn
thing down
(laughs)
Well not that one That one’s
almost like a friend

Conors face shows a growing revelation Could this be the
reason Is it too much to hope for He looks up at the room

Where are you

MonSTER (0S)
I am here

With a breeze tousling Conor’s hair the Monster steps from
the darkness over his Grandma’s office in one easy motion He
stands above Conor huge as ever

ConOR
So can you do it Can you make her
better

The Monster sighs and in what we can see is an extraordinary
action SITS DOWN all its weight on the roof of Grandma’s
office The wood moans Conor winces but it holds

MoNSTER
It is not up to me

CONOR
Why not You said the yew tree was
a tree of healing

MONSTER
It is If your mother can be
healed the yew tree will do it

CONOR
Is that a yes

MonSTER
You still don’t know why you called
me It’s not as if I do this every
day Conor O’Malley

CONOR
I didn’t call you And even if I
did it was obviously for my mum

MONSTER
Was it

CONOR
Why else To listen to idiotic
stories that make no sense

MONSTER
It is not time yet for the Third
Tale But soon

(MORE)

MONSTER (CONTD)
And after that you will tell me
your story Conor O’Malley You
will tell me your truth

CONOR
For God’s sake not this again-

The Monster leans suddenly forward

MOnSTER
You know of what I speak

Conor looks up as the SOUNDS FROM HIS NIGHTMARE start The
camera spins around him as the scene melts away The walls of
the garden grow blacker the sounds of screaming start to
rise dust and debris flying around him

ConOR
No No not this

The wind rising The distant SCREAMING is heard (”Conor”)-

ConOR (CONTD)
No Please

The garden is suddenly as it was before Conor is shaken

ConOR (CONTD)
That’s not my truth That’s just a
nightmare

MonSTER
Nevertheless this is what will
happen after the third tale

The Monster stands Grandma’s office groans in relief

CONOR
I want to know what’s going to
happen with my mum

MONSTER
Do you not know already

The Monster steps back over Grandma’s office It’s leaving

CONOR
Wait

MONSTER
You waste the precious time that is
given you

CONOR
If you’re a tree of healing then I
need you to heal

MONSTER
And so I shall

A huge MURMURATION OF STARLINGS appears over the horizon and

surround the Monster With a last look the Monster LEAKS
AWAY into them flying away

Conor holds up his hands to block the flutter of wings then
all is quiet

A paper drifts down to the floor as she does Looking out
from the crack of his dark bedroom door he can see that it’s
a DRAWING OF HIS OWN

What’s she doing with that He makes to reach out and take
it but Grandma is there first picking it up and walking to

Conor stands lap covered in juice and looks up into the
laughing faces of Anton and Sully either side of Harry’s
usual eerie stare

O’Malley’s wet himself

Anton flicks some spilled juice onto Conor

ANTON
You missed some

They laugh but then notice that Harry and Conor are doing
that uncomfortable staring thing again The laughter dies

shakes it

He lets go of Conor’s hand and turns his back to leave After
a confused beat Anton and Sully do the same

Conor watches them go growing more and more upset a breeze
tousling his hair

ticks over to 1207

ANGLE ON Conor as the The Monster now stands behind him
stretching up to the tall ceiling of the cafeteria It kneels
down and speaks into his ear

MonSTER
It is time for the third tale

Without looking back Conor starts to walk after Harry The
Monster matches him step for step

MONSTER (CONT’D)
There was once an invisible man
who had grown tired of being
unseen

MONSTER (CONTD)
It was not that he was actually
invisible It was just that people
had become used to not seeing him

ConOR
(to Harry)
Hey

Conor quickens his step The Monster keeps up

Conor catches up to Harry and grabs him by the shoulder
twisting him around Harry pretends to not see him pretend-
blaming a laughing Sully for grabbing him

MONSTER
One day the invisible man couldn’t
stand it anymore He kept
wondering if no one sees you are
you really there at all

Conor watches the three bullies walking away again

CONOR
(to Monster wo turning)
What did the invisible man do

MONSTER
He called for a monster

Conor raises his fists Behind him the Monster does the
same

Conor runs after Harry the Monster following

Mum pats the mattress like before But Conor pointedly sits

What did you do to your hands

This is the talk isn’t it
Everybody always wants to have a
talk lately

Mum readies herself smiles again

I wanted to see you And you know
how the morphine sends me off to
Cloud Cuckoo Land sometimes-

ConOR
Why did Grandma get me out of
school

Mum

Look at me son

He refuses at first but finally does arms crossed tight
against himself Here it is There’s no going back

Mum (CONT’D)
I spoke to the doctor this morning
The new treatment isn’t working
sweetheart

ConOR
The one from the yew tree

MUM
Yes

ConOR
How can it not be working

Beat as Mum swallows tries to smile for him
MuM
Things have just moved really fast
Faster than they thought

CONOR
(as if to himself)
But how can it not be working

MUM
I know I had big hopes for our own
personal yew tree

ConOR
But it didn’t help

Mum shakes her head slightly

ConOR (CONTD)
So what happens now What’s the
next treatment

Mum doesn’t answer Which is an answer in itself Conor looks
back at the floor and says the final thing out loud

ConOR (CONTD)
There aren’t any more treatments

MuM
(quietly crying now)
I’m sorry son I’ve never been
more sorry about anything in my
life

ConoR
You said it would work You
believed it would work

MuM
I know

ConOR
You lied You’ve been lying this
whole time

MUM
I think maybe deep in your heart
youve always known though
Haven’t you

She reaches for him but he won’t take her hand

Mum (CONT’D)
It’s okay that you’re angry
sweetheart It really really is
(xrueful laugh)
I’m pretty angry too to tell you
the truth But Conor Are you
listening Conor
Conor still looking away eventually nods

MUM (CONTD)
One day if you look back and you
feel bad for being so angry that
you couldn’t even speak to me then
you have to know that it was okay
That I knew I know everything you
need to tell me without you having
to say it out loud

Conor still can’t look at her She starts crying harder but
pushes through it

MUM (CONTD)
And honestly son you be as angry
as you need to be Don’t let anyone
tell you otherwise Not your
father not your grandma no one
And if you need to break things
then by God you break them good
and hard And I’1l be right there
You might not see me but I’1l1 be
right there breaking ‘em right
along with you

Conor can hardly bear it

MUM (CONT’D)
I need to know that you heard me
sweetheart I need to know okay
Okay

Without looking at her Conor finally nods his agreement The
final acknowledgement that she’s going to die

Mum breathes out in exhausted relief

Mum (CONT’D)
I’m so sorry I’m going to have to
take some more painkillers

Obviously in pain she presses the morphine button She
reaches for Conor again After a beat he finally takes her
hand

MuM (CONTD)
(quietly weeping)
I wish I had a hundred years A
hundred years I could give to you

Conor holds his mother’s hand and looks at the floor as she
drifts to drug-induced sleep There’s nothing more to say

Conor no not tonight You’re

Conor understands what she means as Grandma sits on the other
side of the bed taking her daughter’s hand Conor stands

CONOR
I’m going to get something to eat

Grandma nods and Conor leaves

now

Up the hill dodging through the tombstones
The tree getting closer and closer

ConOR
WAKE UP

Still in the continuous shot he reaches the tree and starts
pounding and kicking it

ConOR (CONTD)
I said WAKE UP I don’t care what
time it is WAKE UP

Kicks it again And again

And the tree steps out of the way causing Conor to fall We
pull up higher and higher in the Monster’s POV seeing Conor
on the ground Continuous shot ends

MONSTER
You will do yourself harm if you
keep that up

Conor gets angrily to his feet It’s nearly night now

CONOR
It didn’t work You said the yew
tree would make her better but it
didn’t

MONSTER
I said if she could be healed the
yew tree would do it It seems she
could not

Conor attacks the monster again pounding it with his fists
He pulls off one of the Monster’s small branches

CONOR

Fix her Make her better
MONSTER

Ow

Conor-
CONOR

(still attacking)
What’s the use of you if you can’t
Just stupid stories and getting me
into trouble and everyone treat me
like I’ve got a disease-
The Monster kneels down hands on either side of Conor

MONSTER
You were the one who called me
Conor O’Malley You were the one
with the answers to these
questions

CONOR
If I called you it was to save
her It was to heal her

MONSTER
I did not come to heal her I came
to heal you

Beat as Conor takes in the impact of this

CONOR
Me I don’t need My mum’s the
one who

But the weight of the Monster’s words are too much

Beat

ConOR (CONTD)
Ahhhhhh
(quietly)
Help me

as the Monster takes in a breath

MonSTER
It is time for the fourth tale

Conor’s eyes widen in horror but before he can speak
world has changed

the

ExT the fourth tale nightmare - AFTERNOON - contINUOUS 133

Conor and the Monster are on a dark barren stretch of
ground An evil place in the blackest night The sounds from
Conor’s nightmare rise again - the blowing wind the faint
rumblings

The Monster stands over Conor but is dangerous-looking and
sinister the branches from its body are unraveling beyond it
in gnarls its eyes changed to a merciless blankness

ConOR
No Please Get me out of here

MonSTER
(scarier than ever)
There will be no more delays It is
time for you to tell the fourth
tale

CONOR
I don’t know any tales I have to
get back to my Mum

The Monster looks past Conor

MONSTER
But she is already here

Conor turns to look Far across the clearing stands his
mother She is frail and thin but not bald dressed in
flowing white cloth She turns and smiles at him but so
vulnerable She’s been the figure in the nightmare all along

CONOR
No Mum Get out of here

Mum
I’m fine darling There’s nothing
to worry about

CONOR
Mum run Please run

Mum
But there’s nothing to worry

But there’s a terrible sound a distant ROARING as of
something impossibly big

Mum (CONT’D)
(troubled)
Conor

OVERHEAD SHOT - high above we see Conor and the Monster
distant from Mum

Behind her in a large circle she stands on the edge of the
GROUND BEGINS TO COLLAPSE AWAY almost like a whirlpool
whipping everything into it along with blackness and dust

ConOR
Mum MUM

He starts to run for her The ground continues to collapse
around her until-

Mum
Conor

It collapses right BELOW HER dropping her into the gaping
swirling hole She grabs on to the edge-

But can’t hold on-

Until Conor reaches her grabbing onto her holding her
there

Here it is Conor’s WORST NIGHTMARE The thing he is most
afraid of in the world The winds shrieking and howling
around them swirling into the hole

CONOR
NO MUM

The nightmare is in full flow The screaming the roaring
the wind all because he’s holding on to his mother trying
to prevent her from falling

Mum
Don’t let go Conor Don’t let me
go
ConOR
(struggling)

I won’t I promise

The wind grows worse the whirlpool effect starts to pull
cars and telephone poles into the hole

Conor’s Mum starts to slip from Conor’s grasp

ConOR (CONTD)
No

Conor turns to our original Monster still not moving

CONOR (CONT’D)
Help me I can’t hold on to her

MuM
Conor I’m slipping

CONOR
NO MUM
But it’s getting too much She’s too heavy The Monster
approaches unraveled and huge and terrifying

MOnSTER

Here is the fourth tale
ConOR

Shut up Help me
MONSTER

Here is the truth of Conor

OMalley
Conor’s Mum is screaming slipping

CONOR
No Help me

She’s pulling away from his hands from his fingers He’s
trying trying-

Mum
Conor

ConOR
NO Mum-

But she falls

The hole takes her and she falls falls falls away her
white dress a light in the darkness Conor watches her fall-

He turns back to the Monster anguished the swirling darkness
behind him THIS IS THE IMAGE HE DREW ON HIS SKETCHPAD

The blackness and furious winds abate until there’s only
quiet

ConOR (CONTD)
(angry frightened)

This is when I wake up This is

when I always wake up

MonSTER
The tale is not yet told

CONOR
Get me out of here I need to see
my mum

MONSTER
She is no longer here Conor You
let her go

CONOR

This is just a nightmare This
isn’t the truth

The Monster leans forward scaring Conor into falling back

MONSTER
It is the truth You let her go
ConOR
She fell I couldn’t hold on to her
any more
MonSTER

You let her go

ConOR
She fell

The Monster leans over him as terrifying as it’s ever been

MonSTER
You must speak the truth or you
will never leave this place

CONOR
Let me go

MoNSTER
Speak the truth

ConOR
What truth I don’t know what you
mean

The Monster’s face surges down close to his punching its
hands either side of Conor causing the ground to CRACK all
around him

MONSTER
You do know

A sudden quiet Conor does know He’s always known
CONOR
(quietly)

No I can’t

MONSTER
You must

CONOR
I can’t

There’s a sudden note of kindness in the Monster’s voice

MONSTER
You can You let her go

Conor begins to cry

CONOR
(shaking his head)
Please-
MONSTER

You let her go Conor OMalley
Didn’t you

Conor squeezes his eyes shut tight

MoNSTER (CONTD)
You could have held on for longer
but you let the nightmare take her
Didn’t you

ConOR
No
MONSTER
YES You allowed her to fall
CONOR
No
MONSTER

You must tell me the fourth tale
Conor OMalley You must

CONOR
It’ll kill me if I do

MoNSTER
It will kill you if you do not

The Monster pounds the ground again terrifying More cracks
form until Conor’s trapped on a broken shelf above the hole
teetering above it
MONSTER (CONT’D)
You let her go Before it’s too
late Tell me WHY

Beat as Conor struggles

ConOR
No-

The ground collapses more the shelf teeters

MoNSTER
(pleading)
Speak the truth
CONOR
No
MONSTER

Speak the truth Conor O’Malley

CONOR
NO

MONSTER
SPEAK THE TRUTH

CONOR
NOoOoOoO

MONSTER

SPEAK THE TRUTH BOY

Until finally

Conor can’t fight it any longer

He speaks the truth

ConOR

I want it to be over I can’t stand
knowing that she’ll go I want it
to be finished I let her fall I
let her die

He collapses to the ground The shelf gives way beneath him
and he falls-

Screaming into the hole-

The Monster disappearing above him-
Until-

WHOOMP He hits something landing on it

It’s the MONSTER’S OUTSTRETCHED HAND It has caught him It
lifts him gently up out of the hole and deposits him

ExT POST NIGHTMARE (hilLTOP) - SUNSET - momentS LATER 134

Back on the ground on the hilltop behind his house The
Monster stands above him Conor sits up his face beyond sad
helpless tears coming

ConOR
Why didn’t it kill me I deserve
punishment I deserve the worst

MonSTER
Do you

ConOR
I’ve known forever she wasn’t going
to make it She said she was
getting better all the time because
that’s what I wanted to hear And I
believed her

(beat)

Except I didn’t

MONSTER
No

CONOR
And I started to think how much I
wanted it to be over I couldn’t
stand how alone it made me feel

MONSTER
A part of you wished it would end
Even if it meant losing her

ConOR
(whispering)
I let her go I could have held on
but I always let her go

MONSTER
And that is your truth Conor
OMalley

CONOR

I didn’t mean it though And now
it’s for real Now she’s going to
die and it’s all my fault

MONSTER
And that is not the truth at all

Conor gives into grief The Monster gently takes him up in
two huge hands making a comforting bed out of them

MONSTER (CONTD)
You were merely wishing for an end
of pain Your own pain It is the
most human wish there is

CONOR
I didn’t mean it

MONSTER
You did but you also did not

Conor looks up at the big face in front of him

CONOR
How can both be true

MONSTER
How can a prince be a murderer and
a saviour How can an apothecary be
evil-tempered but right-thinking
How can invisible men make
themselves more lonely by being
seen

ConOR
(shrugs exhausted)
I don’t know Your stories never
made any sense to me

MONSTER
Because humans are complicated
beasts You believe comforting lies
while knowing full well the painful
truths that make those lies
necessary It is a wonder you can
survive at all

Conor isn’t sure he buys this as much as he might want to

MonSTER (CONT’D)
In the end Conor it is not
important what you think it is
only important what you do

Long beat as Conor considers this

ConOR
So what do I do

MONSTER
What you did just now You speak
the truth

ConOR
That’s all

MONSTER
You think it’s easy You were
willing to die rather than speak
it

CONOR
Because what I thought was so wrong-

MONSTER
It was not wrong It was only a
thought One among millions

Conor takes a long breath he’s exhausted In fact he’s
fighting to keep his eyes open

CONOR
I’m so tired So tired of all of
this

MONSTER
Then sleep There’s time

ConOR
Are you sure I need to get back to
my mum

MonSTER

You will I promise you
Conor considers this

ConOR
Will you be there

MONSTER
Yes It will be the final steps of
my walking

Conor nestles into the monster’s hands

ConOR
How does the fourth story end

MONSTER
Shhh Sleep

But he hears no answer as he can no longer fight off sleep

ExT CHURCHYARD HILLTOP - niGHT - laTER 135

Conor is asleep on the hilltop The Monster is now just a
tree but there’s still a suggestion that it’s cradling him
Conor’s phone buzzes in his pocket but he doesn’t wake We
hear a car pull up and a door open

GranDMA (0S)
(faintly)
Oh thank God

Conor blinks himself awake He looks up

GranDMA (0S) (CONT’D)
Conor CONOR

He sees his Grandma running towards him from where she’s left
her car (lights on engine running door open) by the church
next to the graveyard She’s putting away her phone
obviously the one who’s been calling him

GranDMA (CONT’D)
CONOR

He stands bracing himself but when she reaches him she
grabs him in a hug so vigorous they almost tumble over

She releases him and being who she is starts shouting
GRANDMA (CONTD)
Where have you BEEN I’ve been out

of my MIND trying to find you

ConOR
There was something I needed to-

But she’s already dragging him towards the car

GraNDMA
No time We have to go now

She sprints off away from him back to the car and what this
means sinks in for Conor He races after her

InText grandma’s carcity streets TO TRAIN CROSSING - nilgtét
- moments LATER

Grandma drives at extremely high speed cutting corners
running red lights It would be funny if it weren’t so
desperate Conor sits in the passenger seat shy of how much
she’s both crying and trying to control herself

She turns another corner and he grabs his seatbelt But he
notices something sticking out of his pocket LILY’S NOTE He
takes it out and unfolds a comically high number of times
It’s just three lines

--“I miss being your friend”

--“You’re not invisible”

--“I see you”

The “I” is underlined a comic number of times too It’s
heart-breaking

ConOR
Grandma-

GrandMA
Don’t Just don’t

136A They fly over a bump Conor puts the note back in his podkéaA

ConOR
(quietly)
I’m sorry About the sitting room
And everything

She laughs a thick sad laugh

GranDMA
It doesn’t matter It doesn’t
matter

ConOR

It doesn’t

GRANDMA
Of course it doesn’t

She starts to really cry so just lets herself

136B She turns a corner to a train crossing the barriers firnB6B
coming down No way to drive around it She stops hitting
the steering wheel in frustration

GraNDMA (CONTD)

(beat)
You know Conor You and me Not
the most natural fit are we

ConOR
No I guess not

GRANDMA
I guess not either But we’re going
to have to learn

ConoR
I know

Grandma makes a little sobbing noise

GRANDMA
You do know don’t you Of course
you do But you know what
grandson We have something in

common

ConOR
We do

GRANDMA
Oh yes

We hear the train horn in the distance Grandma looks at him
GranDMA (CONT’D)
Your mum That’s what we have in
common

Conor doesn’t answer but he knows what she means This is
their peace talk and he agrees to it He nods

She reaches forward grabs his hand squeezing it tight The
train blasts past them in a brutal hurry

It’s a short train ending quickly The barriers rise

GranDMA (CONT’D)
Hang on

She peels off into the night

Grandma and Conor race down the corridor Grandma in the

face The fight is clearly almost over for his Mum The room
is lit only by a small light above her bed The Female Nurse
stands by it checking an IV

NuRSE
(to Grandma)
It’s okay You’re in time

Grandma makes a cry of relief covering her mouth with her
hands

Nurse (CONT’D)
I see you found him

Grandma goes to the opposite side sits down and takes her
daughter’s hand kissing it and rocking back and forth

The Nurse leaves acknowledging Conor Conor stands in the
darkness by the doorway not knowing what to do

Mum
(slurring)
Ma

GranDMA
I’m here darling I’m here
Conor’s here too

MUM
(eyes still closed)
Is he

Grandma looks at Conor urging him to say something

ConOR
Im here mum

Eyes still shut Conor’s Mum reaches out a hand for him to
take Just like he held it on the cliff face

There is movement behind Conor a familiar shadow appearing
Somehow the Monster fits in the room

MonSTER
Here is the end of the tale

ConOR
(to Monster)
What do I do

The Monster puts two hands on Conor’s shoulders gently
pushing him towards his mum’s bed

Conor looks at the clock as he goes It reads 1158 Moments
before 1207

ConOR (CONTD)
1207 Is that
(whispering)
I’m afraid

MonSTER
Of course you are afraid It will
be hard It will be more than hard
But you will make it through Conor
OMalley

They reach the bed where his Mum’s hand is still
outstretched Conor’s eyes begin to water

ConOR
(whispering to Monster)
Youll stay You’1l stay until

MonSTER
I will be right here

The moment is here Conor takes his mother’s hand

She opens her eyes but she sees him there Really sees him
Does she even see the Monster behind him

Conor can see the light reflected in her eyes where the
“life” is

MonSTER (CONTD)
Now all that is left is for you to
speak the simplest truth of all

And at last Conor can finally tell her the real truth

ConOR
(simply quietly)
I don’t want you to go

Mum
(at the end)
I know my love I know

Conor’s tears begin to spill now in a quiet way
ConOR
(again)

I don’t want you to go

And there’s nothing more to say He leans forward onto her
bed and slips an arm around her holding on to her

The mother closes her eyes finally We pull back Conor holds
his mother the Monster supporting him his Grandma across
the bed holding his Mum’s hand

a slow approach towards the clock on the hospital room
wall As the second hand slowly sweeps from 120640 to
120645 we hear Conor’s earlier question to the Monster

ConOR (vO)
How does the fourth story end

And this time we hear the Monster’s response

MonSTER (VO)
It ends with the boy holding on
tight to his mother And by doing
so he can finally let her go

We dissolve gently to black before the second hand’s sweep
reaches 1207

Fade TO BLACK

Then fade up on

inT grandma’s front HALLWAY - dawn 140

It’s the morning after Dawn light comes in through the
windows A clock reads 7am Conor and Grandma enter wearing
the same clothes as the night before They’re spent
exhausted

They climb the stairs together in their grief

Conor heads to the Guest Bedroom but

GranDMA
No

He stops She nods to the loft conversion that’s always been
locked

GRANDMA (CONTD)
It’s your room now I’ve been
making it ready

She nods him on his way watching him go to the end of the
corridor climbing the steep stairs

He looks back once at her to make sure it’s okay She smiles
at him so sadly

He tries the door For the first time it’s unlocked He
looks to his Grandma for one last check She nods again and
lets him go

InT GRANDMA’S lofT room - conTINUOUS 142

It’s a bedroom in the top of the house complete with slanted
ceiling and big window letting in a ton of morning light
Clearly his mother’s But the projector is there too and
the canisters for King Kong

There is also the CASE OF PENCILS he’d been eyeing in the
shop window newly purchased by Grandma

Conor steps inside Drawings cover the walls there are
shelves of SKETCHPADS in rows and at the far end a DESK
just like the one in Conor’s room

On it is Conor’s torn drawing of the nightmare from the
sitting room

Conor approaches it and picks it up Underneath is a
SKETCHPAD an old one There’s a note on top from his
Grandma “This belonged to your mum”

On the cover are the words “Lizzie’S SKETCHPAD AGE 12 (anda
half)”

Conor opens it We recognise his mum’s style of art He turns
the pages past images of trees birds friends and then-

Drawing after drawing of the STORIES AND IMAGES WE’VE SEEN
the Prince the Farmer’s Daughter the Apothecary the Parson
and-

The Monster Pages and pages of the Monster Conor stops on
one a good one the Monster looking ominous powerful

On the desk pencils start to ROLL slightly towards the
sketchpad

ANGLE ON Conor looking at the page a small BREEZE stirring
his hair the slightest hint of a private smile curling up

We pull back giving him his privacy and we
