UNDERWATER CANAL - NIGHT

Glimmering shape moves through the water As it comes closer we recognize it as a tragic mask —
which is pulled up and out of the water

EXT CANAL — NIGHT

Misty night The moon is reflected in the canal A gondola appears through the mist As it passes

us we see a SLOUCHING FIGURE wearing the tragic mask The gondola crosses another which
moors up A veiled figure disembarks A nightdress flashes white beneath a cloak as the figure

runs off

EXT ST MARKS SQUARENIGHT

TWO ROBED MEN (SENATORS) walk briskly towards the Doges palace
TWO CAPTAINS approach from the other side

INT COUNCIL CHAMBER - NIGHT

CLOSEUP 16th century map of the Mediterranean by the flickering light of a fire Venice is
central Rhodes and Cyprus are surrounded by symbols denoting armies and ships

We pull back to see that the map is spread across a large table TWO ATTENDANTS stand over
it holding torches Their light gives glimpses of the several OFFICERS and ATTENDANTS in
the background and of the rich tapestries and paintings of battles that adorn the walls

SEVERAL ELDERLY SENATORS avishly dressed and dripping jewelry sit clutching letters
The Ist and 2nd Senators take their place among them MESSENGERS run back and forth

The DOGE (DUKE) OF VENICE sits by the fireside playing chess with an elegant YOUNG
MAN (LODOVICO) We catch snippets of urgent conversation between the Senators

FIRST SENATOR
There is no composition in these news
That gives them credit

SECOND SENATOR
Indeed they are disproportioned
My letters say a hundred and seven galleys

FIRST SENATOR
And mine a hundred and forty

A TURKISH EMISSARY arrives with a scroll A SOLDIER delivers the scroll to the Doge He
studies the following

Sultan of the Turks to the Signory of Venice

We demand of you Cyprus which you shall give
willingly or perforce Beware therefore

lest you arouse our wrath for we shall wage
most cruel war against you everywhere’

He passes the scroll to his Senators There is a flurry of activity
DUKE
Tis certain then for Cyprus
EXT STREET — NIGHT

The veiled figure rounds a corner into a seedy back street and runs through an arcade passing a
trio of late night masked revelers

INT CHAPEL — NIGHT

Three men stand silently tensely A PRIEST a handsome SOLDIER (CASSIO) and a black
GENERAL (OTHELLO)
The door bursts open The men rise The veiled figure stands panting in the doorway and pulls
back the veil to reveal a beautiful young woman DESDEMONA

INT CHAPEL — NIGHT

Othello and Desdemona stand before the Priest Othello fumbles awkwardly with the ring then
slips it onto her finger They lean in to kiss We pull back to reveal

EXT INT CHAPEL — NIGHT

A richly DRESSED GENTLEMAN (RODERIGO) and a SOLDIER (IAGO) watching through the
window as Othello and Desdemona kiss Roderigos face twists in agony

RODERIGO
I take it much unkindly that thou Iago
Shouldst know of this

Othello brings out a sash and places it across Cassio’s shoulder who bows

IAGO
By the faith of man
1 know my price I am worth no worse a place
But he that never set a squadron in the field
Nor the division of a battle knows
More than a spinster must his Lieutenant be
And I of whom his eyes had seen the proof —
God bless the mark — his moorships Ancient

Cassio cannot contain his smile They clasp hands Othello takes out a small dagger studded with
rubies and gives it to him The two men embrace Cassio pays the Priest and they both leave

Othello and Desdemona are now alone They move towards each other tentatively
Roderigo turns away in disgust He pulls Iago beneath the window and whispers

RODERIGO
By heaven I rather would have been his hangman

IAGO
Why theres no remedy Tis the curse of service

RODERIGO
I would not follow him then

IAGO
O Sir content you
I follow him to serve my turn upon him
We cannot all be masters nor all masters
Cannot be truly followed You shall mark
Heaven is my judge not I for love and duty
But seeming so for my peculiar end
I am not what I am

RODERIGO
What a full fortune does the thick lips owe
If he can carryt thust

IAGO
Call up her father

Roderigo considers then sets off Iago turns and looks directly into the Camera Though his
expression is blank his eyes shine with tears

The other Senators look disapprovingly at the Duke

FIRST SENATOR

INT BRABANTIOS BEDROOM - NIGHT
An OLD MAN (BRABANTIO) lies asleep in his bed He mumbles and writhes

RODERIGO
What ho Brabantio Signor Brabantio ho
IAGO

Brabantio sits bolt upright as if waking from a nightmare eyes staring

EXT BRABANTIOS BEDROOM -— NIGHT

Roderigo and lago shouting Awake Brabantio Magnifico Brabantio appears on his
balcony in his night-dress Iago ducks into the shadows

BRABANTIO
(peering into the darkness)
What is the reason of this terrible summons What is the
matter here

Jago urges Roderigo to speak

RODERIGO
(nervously)
Signor is all your family within

BRABANTIO
I know thee Roderigo
And have charged thee not to haunt about my doors
In honest plainness thou hast heard me say
My daughter is not for thee

IAGO
Are your doors locked

BRABANTIO
Why wherefore ask you this

IAGO
Zounds sir youre robbed for shame put on your gown
Your heart is burst you have lost half your soul

BRABANTIO
What have you lost your wits

IAGO
Even now now very now an old black ram
Is tupping your white ewe Arise I say

BRABANTIO
What profane wretch art thou

IAGO
Iam one sire that comes to tell you your daughter and the
Moor are now making the beast with two backs
BRABANTIO
Thou art a villain

IAGO
You are a senator

BRABANTIO
This thou shalt answer Roderigo

RODERIGO
Sir I will answer anything but I beseech you
Straight satisfy yourself
If she be in your chamber or your house
Let loose on me the justice of the state
For thus deluding you

BRABANTIO
Strike on the tinder ho
Give me a taper call up all my people

Brabantio mutters to himself struggling for breath

BRABANTIO
This accident is not unlike my dream
Belief of it oppresses me already

(yelling)
Light I say light
Brabantio goes back into his room Sounds of commotion
Jago congratulates Roderigo with a firm shake of the hand

Roderigo gives him a purse

IAGO
Farewell for I must leave you

Roderigo tries to grab him but lago eludes him and goes
Brabantio comes out of his front door into the street
A BAND OF MEN carrying torches gather at his side

BRABANTIO
It is too true an evil Gone she is
Do you know where we may
Apprehend her and the Moor

RODERIGO
I think I can discover him

BRABANTIO
O that you had had her
(shouting to his Servants)
Get weapons Ho

IAGO
You Roderigo Come air I am for you

He draws the confused Roderigo to one side

OTHELLO
Hold your hands
Both you of my inclining and the rest
Were it my cue to fight I should have known it
Without a prompter

BRABANTIO
O thou foul thief
Where hast thou stowed my daughter
Damned as thou art thou hast enchanted her
Trun from her guardage to the sooty bosom
Of such a thing as thou
Lay hold upon him

Brabantios Men make for Othello Othello’s Men prepare to defend him

OTHELLO
Keep up your bright swords for the dew will rustem
Good Signor where will you that I go to answer this your
charge

BRABANTIO
To Prison til fit time
Of law and course of direct session
call thee to answer

OTHELLO
What if I do obey
How many the Duke be therewith satisfied
Whose messengers are here about my side
To bring me to him

CASSIO
Tis true most worthy Signor
The Dukes in council and your noble self
Iam sure is sent for

BRABANTIO
How The Duke in council In this time of night Bring
him away

Brabantio sets off Othello rebuffs the arms that try to take hold of him but follows Brabantio

INT COUNCIL CHAMBER — NIGHT
The door opens and Othello enters Brabantio Iago Roderigo Cassio and OFFICERS follow

DUKE
Valiant Othello we must straight employ you
Against the general Turkish foe

Brabantio pushes his way forward

DUKE
I did not see you Welcome gentle Signor
We lacked your counsel and your help tonight

BRABANTIO
So did I yours Good your grace pardon me
Neither my place nor aught I heard of business
Hath raised me from my bed

DUKE
Why Whats the matter

BRABANTIO
My daughter O my daughter

DUKE
Dead

BRABANTIO
Ay to me
She is abused stolen from me and corrupted
For nature so preposterously to err
Sans witchcraft could not

DUKE
Whoeer he be that in this foul proceeding
Hath thus beguiled your daughter of herself

And you of her the bloody book of law

You shall yourself read in the bitter letter

After your own sense yea though our proper son
Stood in your action

BRABANTIO
Humbly I thank your grace
Here is the man

He indicates Othello An embarrassed silence

FIRST SENATOR
We are very sorry fort

DUKE
(to Othello)
What in your own part can you say to this

BRABANTIO
Nothing but this is so

OTHELLO
Most potent grave and reverend signors
My very noble and approved good masters
That I have taen away this old mans daughter
It is most true

Gasps of shock and outrage setting off a series of whispers

OTHELL
O true I have married her

The whispering grows louder

OTHELLO
The very head and front of my offending
Hath this extent no more

Roderigo gasps indignantly The Duke silences the noise

OTHELLO
Rude am I in my speech
And little blessed with the soft phrase of peace
Since these arms of mine had seven years pith
Till now some nine moons wasted they have used
Their dearest action in the tented field
And little of this great world can I speak
More than pertains to feats of broil and battle
And therefore little shall I grace my cause
In speaking of myself Yet by your gracious patience
I will round unvarnished tale deliver
Of my whole course of love what drugs what charms
What conjuration and what mighty magic —
For such proceedings am I charged withal —
I won his daughter
BRABANTIO
A maiden never bold
of spirit so still and quiet that her motion
Blushed at herself — and she in spite of nature
To fall in love with what she feared to look on

OTHELLO
I do beseech you send for the lady
And let her speak of me before her father
If you do find me foul in her report
The trust the office I do hold of you
Not only take away but let your sentence
Even fall upon my life

All eyes turn to the Duke The Duke turns to Brabantio who smiles and nods morbidly

DUKE
Fetch Desdemona hither

Othello gestures to Iago who leaves with two Attendants

DUKE
Speak Othello

OTHELLO
Her father loved me oft invited me
Still questioned me the story of my life
From year to year — the battles sieges fortunes
That I have passed

way

Devour up my discourse which I observing

She swore in faith twas strange twas passing strange
Twas pitiful twas wondrous pitiful

BRABANTIO
Come hither gentle mistress
Do you perceive in all this company
Where most you owe obedience

DESDEMONA
My noble father
To you I am bound for life and education
My life and education both do learn me
How to respect you You are lord of all my duty
lam hitherto your daughter But heres my husband
And so much duty as my mother showed
To you preferring you before her father
So much I challenge that I may profess
Due to the Moor my lord

Brabantios face creases in pain Roderigo likewise

BRABANTIO
God buy I have done
I had rather to adopt a child than get it
Come hither Moor
There do give thee that with all my heart
Which but thou hast already with all my heart
I would keep from thee

Brabantio takes his daughters hand and places it in Othellos Othello grasps it vehemently
Desdemona winces

As Brabantio turns away his face contorts again and he clutches at his chest His feet give way
and Othello and Roderigo rush to his aid He pushes them away

BRABANTIO
I humbly beseech you proceed to thaffairs of state

The Duke waits until Brabantio is safely seated

DUKE
The Turk with a most mighty preparation makes for
Cyprus Othello you must away tonight The affair cries
haste and speed must answer it

OTHELLO
With all my heart
Most humbly therefore bending to your state
I crave fit disposition for my wife

Due reference of place and exhibition

With such accommodation and resort

As levels with her breeding

There is a murmur of disapproval amongst the Senators

DUKE
Why if you please
Bet at her fathers

BRABANTIO
Ill not have it so

OTHELLO
Nor I

DESDEMONA
Nor I I would not there reside
To put my father in impatient thoughts
By being in his eye Most gracious Duke

DUKE
What would you Desdemona

DESDEMONA
That I did love the Moor to live with him
My downright violence and scorn of fortunes
May trumpet to the world My hearts subdued
Even to the utmost pleasure of my lord
I saw Othellos visage in his mind
And to his honours and his valiant parts
Did I my soul and fortunes consecrate
So that dear lords if I be left behind
A moth of peace and he go to the war
The rites for which I love him are bereft me
And a heavy interim shall support
By his dear absence-lot me go with him

OTHELLO
Let her have your voice
And heaven defend your good souls that you think
I will your serious and great business scant
For she is with me

The Duke glances at the ailing Brabantio

DUKE
Be it as you shall privately determine
Either for her stay or going
At nine ithmorning here well meet again
Good night to everyone And noble Signor

He beckons Brabantio and draws him to one side

DUKE
If virtue no delighted beauty lack
Your son-in-law is far more fair than black

Desdemona sees that Othello has overheard this and is not amused
The Duke leaves

FIRST SENATOR
Adieu brave Moor
(he leaves)

SECOND SENATOR
Use Desdemona well

Othello is immediately riled but Desdemona calms him

BRABANTIO
Look to her Moor if thou hast eyes to see
She has deceived her father and may thee

OTHELLO
My life upon her faith

Brabantio leaves

OTHELLO
Honest Iago
My Desdemona must I leave to thee
I prithee let thy wife attend on her
And bring them after in the best advantage
Come Desdemona we must obey the time

Othello and Desdemona leave and Iago is about to follow

RODERIGO
Iago

Jago turns back to the apparently empty room Roderigo steps out of the shadows

IAGO
What sayst thou noble heart

RODERIGO
What will I do thinkst thou

IAGO
Why go to bed and sleep

RODERIGO
I will incontinently drawn myself
O Desdemona

IAGO
If thou dost I shall never love thee after
Why thou silly gentleman

RODERIGO
It is silliness to live when to live is a torment

IAGO
O villainous

Jago sits in the Dukes chair and pours himself a drink

IAGO
I have looked upon the world For four times seven years
and I never yet found a man that know how to love himself
Ere I would say I would drown myself for the love of a
guineau-hen I would change my humanity with a baboon

RODERIGO
What should I do I confess it is my shame to be so fond
but it is not in my virtue to amend it

IAGO
Virtue A fig Tis in ourselves that we are thus or thus We
have reason to cool our raging motions our carnal stings
our unbitted lusts Whereof I take this which you call love
to be a sect or scion

RODERIGO
It cannot be

IAGO
It is merely a lust of the blood and a permission of the will
Come be a man Drown thyself Drown cats and blind
puppies

He gets a smile out of Roderigo

IAGO
I have professed me thy friend and I confess me knit to thy
deserving with cables of perdurable toughness I could
never better stead thee than now Put money in thy purse
Follow thou these wars disguise thy features with an
usurped beard

Roderigo looks skeptical

IAGO
I say put money in thy purse It cannot be that Desdemona
should long continue her love to the Moor — put but money
in thy purse When she is sated with his body she will find
the error of her choice She must have change she must —
fill thy purse with money If sanctimony and a frail vow
betwixt an erring barbarian and a super-subtle venetian be
not too hard for my wits and all the tribe of hell thou shall
enjoy her Therefore put

He encourages Roderigo to join in

IAGO and RODERIGO
Money in thy purse
They laugh

IAGO
A pox on drowning tis clean out of the way Seek thou
rather to be hanged in compassing thy joy than to be
drowned and go without her

RODERIGO
Wilt thou be fast to my hopes

Roderigo dangles a purse Iago pushes it away

IAGO
Thou art sure of me There are many events in the womb of
time which will be delivered Go provide thy money We
will have more of this tomorrow Adieu

Roderigo sets off contentedly A thought occurs and he returns

RODERIGO
Where shall we meet ith morning

IAGO
At my lodging
RODERIGO
(contented again)

Ill be with thee betimes

IAGO
Go to farewell
(calling him back)
Do you hear Roderigo

RODERIGO
(returning again)
What say thou

IAGO
No more of drowning do you hear

RODERIGO
(laughing)
I am changed

Iago flashes his palm Roderigo automatically drops his purse into it

IAGO
Go to Farewell
(calling out again)
Put money enough in your purse

RODERIGO
(returning again)

Ill sell all my land

They both laugh as Roderigo leaves lago turns to address the Camera
IAGO
Thus do I ever make my fool my purse For I mine own
gained knowledge should profane if I would time expend
with such a snipe But for my sport and profit — I hate the
Moor And it is thought abroad that twixt my sheets Hes
done my office I know not ift be true But I for more
suspicion in that kind Will do as if for surety He holds me
well The better shall my purpose work on him

He studies the Dukes chessboard
IAGO
Cassios a proper man Let me see now
To got his place and to plume up my will
In double knavery How

He looks into the Camera as if it had made a suggestion

IAGO
How

He turns back to the chessboard

There is a distant rumble of a storm brewing

IAGO

He pockets the three pieces He toasts the Camera empties his glass and spits it into the fire The

In faith too much

More laughter

EMILIA

IAGO
No let me not

Desdemona looks troubled Cassio comforts her
Jago takes out a knife and cuts a piece of fruit He glimpses them in the reflection of his knife

effigy burns CYPRIOT WOMEN walk amongst the Soldiers

INT MAIN HALL —- NIGHT
The dancing continues Othello beckons Cassio to dance with Desdemona

OTHELLO
Heaven bless the isle of Cyprus

MONTANO
And our worthy general Othello

CASSIO
He hath achieved a maid
That paragons descriptions and wild fame
One that excels the quirks of blazoning pens
And in the essential vesture of creation
Does bear all excellency

DOVES dyed in many colours are released into the room

The other men join in the dance around Desdemona Othello watches admiringly The women then
Join the men dancing Iago dances with Emilia

Cassio pulls Iago aside and whispers in his ear Othello dances with Emilia

EXT CASTLE GRASS COURTYARD - NIGHT

A DRUNKEN SOLDIER pulls a striking WOMAN (BIANCA) out of an embrace with a
CYPRIOT and tries to kiss her

The Cypriot pushes him down A number of SOLDIERS leap to their feet and several CYPRIOTS
move in to support their compatriot

Jago now in military uniform steps in with bottles of wine and distributes them He raises his own
and leads a toast

IAGO
Heaven bless this isle and the
perdition of the Turkish fleet

ALL
Heaven bless this isle

Jago kisses Bianca himself and gets an appreciative laugh

Bianca looks up and sees Cassio at the window

INT MAIN HALL IN CASTLE - NIGHT
Cassio smiles nervously at Bianca and backs away from the window

OTHELLO
Good Michael look you to the guard tonight
Lets teach ourselves that honourable stop
Not to outsport discretion

CASSIO
Iago hath direction what to do
But notwithstanding with my personal eye
Will I look tot

OTHELLO
Iago is most honest
Michael good night

They salute one another and Cassio reaches for Desdemonas hand She smiles at his formality
but cooperates graciously He kisses her hand

OTHELLO
Come my dear love

EXT GRASS COURTYARD - NIGHT

Roderigo is wedged against the wheel of a cart A pair of LOVERS lie entwined on the cart A
stone under one of its wheels prevents it rolling down a gentle incline He finishes his bottle and is
pulled off balance He turns to see lago crouched beneath the cart and beckoning him

Roderigo crawls drunkenly under the cart to join him

IAGO
If thou best valiant — as they say base men being in love
have then a nobility in their natures more then is native to
them —

Roderigo senses this may be an insult but is too inebriated to understand it and decides not to
take offense lago presses down the edge of Roderigos false beard which has lifted a little

IAGO
— list me The Lieutenant tonight watches on the court of
guard First I must tell thee this Desdemona is directly in
love with him

RODERIGO
With Cassio Why tis not possible

Forgetting his location Roderigo leaps up and bangs his head The Lovers above them shift
position visible through the slats of wood in the cart

IAGO
Lay thy finger thus and let thy soul be instructed Mark
me her eye must be fed and what delight shall she have to
look on the devil Her delicate tenderness has found itself
abused begun to heave the gorge disrelish and abhor the
Moor Her very nature instructs her to it and compels her
to some second choice

RODERIGO
(nursing his head)
I cannot believe that in her shes full of most blessed
condition

IAGO
Blessed figs end The wine she drinks is made of grapes If
she had been blessed she would never have loved the Moor
Blessed pudding Didst thou not see her paddle with the
palm of his hand Didst thou not mark that

RODERIGO
Yes that I did But that was but courtesy

IAGO
Lechery by this hand

Much to Roderigos distaste the Lovers above are growing noisier

IAGO
An index and obscure prologue to the history of lust and
foul thoughts They met so near with their lips that their
breaths embraced together Villainous thoughts Roderigo
When these mutualities so marshal the way hard at hand
comes the master and main exercise thincorporate
conclusion

Roderigo recoils in revulsion Iago protects Roderigo from banging his head again

IAGO
But sir be you ruled by me I have brought you from
Venice Watch you with the guard tonight for the
command Ill layt upon you Ill not be far from you Do
you find some occasion to anger Cassio

RODERIGO
Well

Jago risks a cocky glimpse at the Camera

INT NIGHT

Othello shuts the door behind him and looks around He sees a trail of Desdemonas clothes and
follows it It leads to the drapes of their four-poster bed One of the drapes twitches He hears
giggling and sees the wriggling contours of a semi-naked body Desdemona peeps out

OTHELLO
The purchase made the fruits are to ensue
That profits yet to come tween me and you

EXT GRASS COURTYARD - NIGHT

Roderigo rolls out from under the cart and dusts himself off

Jago still beneath the cart takes out his chess pieces the black king the white queen and the
knight — and stands them in the dirt in front of him

IAGO
(to Camera)
That Cassio loves her I do well believet
That she loves him tis apt and of great credit
The Moor — howbeit that I endure him not —
Is of a constant loving noble nature

And I dare think hell prove to Desdemona

A most dear husband Now I do love her too
Not out of absolute lust — though peradventure
I stand accountant for as great sin —

But partly led to diet my revenge

For that I do suspect the lusty Moor

Hath leaped into my seat the thought whereof

He is instantly seething with anger and jealously

IAGO
Doth like a poisonous mineral gnaw my inwards
And nothing can or shall content my soul
Til I am evened with him wife for wife or

He drops the passion like an unwanted toy

IAGO
failing so yet that I put the Moor
At least into a jealousy so strong
That judgment cannot cure Which thing to do
Ill have our Michael Cassio on the hip
Abuse him to the Moor in the rank

A short reprise of the passion

IAGO
For I fear Cassio with my night-cap too
Make the Moor thank me love me and reward me
For making him egregiously an ass
And practicing upon his peace and quiet
Even to madness

He gathers the chess pieces He looks at the knights pointed lance then up at an inviting buttock
about him He throws a mischievous look at the Camera Turning back though he merely places a

playful peck on the ‘cheek

Pocketing the king and queen he leaves the knight under the cartwheel As he rolls out he knocks
the stone away from under the wheel

IAGO
Tis here but yet confused

Knaverys plain face is never seen till used

With the Lovers oblivious the cart rolls out of sight leaving the knight crushed in the dust

INT BEDROOM - NIGHT
Desdemona and Othello approach each other slowly She starts to undo the buttons of his shirt

She pulls him over to the fireside

INT THE ARMOURY - NIGHT
The Armoury at the end of the Soldiers Quarters Cassio now in military uniform straps his
sword to his side THREE ARMED SOLDIERS stop out of the door into the night He is about to
follow but is confronted by the figure of Iago in the doorway swaying bottle in hand

CASSIO
Welcome Iago we must to the watch

IAGO
Not this hour Lieutenant tis not yet ten othclock Our
general cast us thus early for the love of his Desdemona
who let us not therefore blame

IAGO
He hath not yet made wanton the night with her and she is
sport for Jove

Cassio She is a most exquisite lady

IAGO
And Ill warrant her full of game

CASSIO
She is indeed perfection

IAGO
Well happiness to their sheets Come Lieutenant I have a
stoop of wine and here without are a brace of Cyprus
gallants that would fain have a measure to the health of
black Othello

CASSIO
Not tonight good Iago I have very poor and unhappy
brains for drinking I could well wish courtesy would
invent some other custom of entertainment

IAGO
O they are our friends But one cup Ill drink for you

CASSIO
I have drunk but one cup tonight already and dare not task
my weakness with any more

IAGO
What man a night of revels the gallants desire it

Cassio considers lago smiles infectiously

CASSIO
Where are they

IAGO

(to Camera)
If I can fasten but one cup upon him

INT BEDROOM - NIGHT
A fire blazes Apple peel lies on the floor

Next to it Othello and Desdemona kiss passionately their faces glistening with sweat Desdemona
pulls back and rolls the peeled apple across Othellos forehead mopping up the beads of sweat
She rolls it down and across his upper lip She holds it under her nose and breathes in deeply

He takes it from her mouth and kisses her He rolls the apple around the small of her back He
slips it into her armpit She gasps He closes her arm over it smiles and kisses her again

EXT COURTYARD — NIGHT

A band of Venetian and Cypriot SOLDIERS sit drinking by a fire lago Cassio and Roderigo are
among them Behind them fireworks light up the sky

IAGO
(singing)
And let me the canakin clink clink
And let me the canakin clink
A soldiers a man
O mans lifes but a span
Why then let a soldier drink

(pause)
Some wine boys

He pours more wine They repeat the verse with the Venetians encouraging the uncomprehending
Cypriots to join in A Cypriot offers Iago a sip from his flask lago winces at the strength The
Cypriots laugh

CASSIO
Fore God an excellent song

IAGO
I learned it in England where indeed they are most potent
in potting Your Dane your German and your swag-
bellied Hollander — drink ho — are nothing to your
English

CASSIO
Is your Englishman so expert in his drinking

IAGO
Why he drinks you with facility your Dane dead drunk he
sweats not to overthrow your Alemaine he gives your
Hollander a vomit ere the next pottle can be filled

CASSIO
(proposing a toast)
To the health of our General

Montano arrives from the main hall

CASSIO
lam for it Lieutenant and Ill do you justice

The others cheer as Montano raises his tankard to meet Cassio’s
IAGO
Drink ho

They race each other to empty their tankards accompanied by encouraging cheers A dead heat

IAGO
O sweet England

They congratulate each other Bianca walks past

BIANCA
Save you friend Cassio

CASSIO
How ist with you most fair

BIANCA
Bianca

She pulls a ribbon from her hair and drops it in his lap The other men laugh Iago pours refills
and encourages the Cypriot with the flask to pour some into Cassios tankard as a prank

INT BEDROOM - NIGHT
Othello and Desdemona at the height of passion

Desdemonas arm stretches out over the side of the bed her fingers splayed Othellos hand
reaches for hers Their fingers meet and clench together Groans of pleasure

INT BEDROOM - NIGHT
Othello and Desdemona lie in each others Arms

OTHELLO
If it were now to die
Twere now to be most happy for I fear
My soul hath her content so absolute
That not another comfort like to this
Succeeds in unknown fate

DESDEMONA
The heavens forbid
But that our loves and comforts should increase
Even as our days do grow

OTHELLO
Amen to that sweet powers
EXT COURTYARD — NIGHT
IAGO

(singing)
‘Tin pride that pulls the country down
Then take thine auld cloak about thee

It finishes on a haunting melancholy note and Iago leaves a moments silence Cassio finishes his
drink Iago starts to pour more

CASSIO
Lets have no more of this lets to our affairs God forgive
us our sins Gentlemen lets look to our business

He clambers to his feet but has a little difficulty keeping his balance The others snigger

CASSIO
Do not think gentlemen I am drunk This is my Ancient
this is my right hand and this is my left hand I am not
drunk now I can stand well enough and I speak well
enough

ALL
Excellent well

CASSIO
Why very well you must not think then that I am drunk

Cassio concentrates on walking in a straight line He succeeds Once hes gone into the darkness
we hear him fall and the others collapse into hysterics

Jago nods at Roderigo who gets up and goes after Cassio
Montano gets to his feet

CASSIO
To the platform master come lets set the watch

Iago moves in to have a quiet word with Montano

IAGO
You see this fellow that is gone before
He is a soldier fit to stand by Caesar
And give direction and do but see his vice

Jago indicates the empty bottles at their feet

CASSIO
But is he often thus

IAGO
Tis evermore the prologue to his sleep

Roderigo returns at a run hotly pursued by Cassio

CASSIO
Zounds you rogue you rascal
(pause)
Whats the matter Lieutenant
(pause)
A knave teach me my duty Ill beat the knave into a
twiggen-bottle
RODERIGO
Beat me

CASSIO
Dost thou prate rogue

He strikes Roderigo with the back of his hand knocking him to the ground He hits him again
Roderigo kicks out at him and Cassio draws his sword

CASSIO
Nay good Lieutenant I pray you sir hold your hand Let

me go sir or Ill knock you oer the mazzard

MONTANO
Come come youre drunk

CASSIO
Drunk

He turns his sword on Montano who draws his own

IAGO
Nay good Lieutenant Gods will gentlemen

Cassio strikes at Montano As the fight begins lago picks Roderigo up and whispers

IAGO
Away I say go and cry out a mutiny

Roderigo runs out We hear cries of MUTINY
Roderigo rings the Courtyard Bell The Alarm is taken up by the nearby bigger bell
Although there are now three men against him Cassios wildness is hard to combat The
CYPRIOTS look on confused and alarmed Cassios sword is knocked out of his hand He grabs
burning logs and hurls them
IAGO
Help ho Lieutenant Sir Montana Sir

INT ARMORY - NIGHT

SOLDIERS reach for their weapons A bell starts ringing Shouts and running feet

EXT FORTIFICATIONS — NIGHT

SOLDIERS leave their posts

INT BEDROOM - NIGHT

Othello moves quietly but quickly out of bed while Desdemona sleeps He grabs his sword
EXT COURTYARD — NIGHT

Cassio is surrounded He swings a long burning log and scatters his opponents A bell rings
loudly TWO SOLDIERS rush in and restrain those closest Montanos men In that moment
Cassio plunges his dagger into Montanos side

IAGO
Gods will Lieutenant hold

Cassio is shocked at his action Montano grabs him round the throat Othello arrives half-
dressed armed men at his side

OTHELLO
Hold for your lives

Montanos Men enraged by his wounding struggle to free themselves Cassio and Montano are
still locked in combat Iago attempts to separate them

IAGO
Hold The General speaks to you Hold for shame

OTHELLO
What is the matter here are we turned Turks
For Christian shams put by this barbarous brawl

The fighters stop as they see pikes and arrows leveled at them

OTHELLO
He that stirs next to carve for his own rage
Holds his soul light He dies upon his motion

The fighters drop their weapons and shuffle into line

OTHELLO
Silence that dreadful bell It frights the isle
From her propriety What is the matter masters

Silence

OTHELLO
How comes it Michael you are thus forgot

CASSIO
I pray you pardon me I cannot speak

OTHELLO
Worthy Montano Whats the matter
That you unlace your reputation thus
And spend your rich opinion for the name
Of a night-brawler Give me answer to it

MONTANO
Worthy Othello I am hurt to danger
Your officer ago can inform you
While I spare speech of all that I do know

OTHELLO
Now by heaven

My blood begins my safer guides to rule

Give me to know

How this foul rout began who set it on

And he that is approved in this offense
Though he had twinned with me both at a birth
Shall lose me What In a town of war

To manage private and domestic quarrel

In night and on the court and guard of safety
Tis monstrous On thy love I charge thee
Iago who begant

MONTANO
If partially affined or leagued in office
Thou dost deliver more or less than truth
Thou art no soldier

IAGO
Touch me not so near
I had rather have this tongue cut from my mouth
Than it should do offence to Michael Cassio

All eyes turn to Cassio

IAGO
Yet I persuade myself to speak the truth
Shall nothing wrong him This it is General

He steps forward and stands to attention

IAGO
Montano and myself being in speech
There comes a fellow crying out for help
And Cassio following him with determined sword
To execute upon him Sir this gentleman
Steps in to Cassio and entreats his pause
Myself the crying fellow did pursue
Lest by his clamour as it so fell out
The town might fall in fright He swift of foot
Outran my purpose and I returned the rather
For that I heard the clink and fall of swords
And Cassio high in oath which till tonight
I neer might say before when I came back —
For this was brief — I found them close together
At blow and thrust even as again they were
When you yourself did part them
More of this matter can I not report

Jago drops his military tone for a confidential one

IAGO
But men are men the best sometimes forget
Though Cassio did some little wrong to him
As men in rage strike those that wish them best
Yet surely Cassio

OTHELLO
I know Iago
Thy honesty and love doth mince this matter
Making it light to Cassio Cassio

Othello approaches him Cassio reeling slightly attempts to stand straight

OTHELLO
I love thee
But nevermore be officer of mine

Desdemona appears attended by Emilia

OTHELLO
Look if my gentle love be not raised up
Ill make thee an example

Othello rips the lieutenants sash from Cassios jacket

DESDEMONA
Whats the matter dear

OTHELLO
Alls well now sweeting come away to bed
Sir for your hurts myself will be your surgeon

Othello leads Desdemona away

OTHELLO
Tis the soldiers life
To have their balmy slumbers waked with strife

EXT COURTYARD — NIGHT

Later Cassio sinks to the ground He is alone except for lago who tidies up putting smoking logs
back into the fire

IAGO
What are you hurt Lieutenant

CASSIO
Ay past all surgery

IAGO
Marry God forbid

CASSIO
O I have lost my reputation I have lost the immortal part
of myself and what remains is bestial My reputation Iago
my reputation

IAGO
As I am an honest man I thought you had received some
bodily wound there is more offense in that than in
reputation

He kneels to comfort Cassio
IAGO
What man There are ways to recover the General again
You are but now cast in his mood — a punishment more in
policy than in malice Sue to him again and hes yours

CASSIO
I would rather sue to be despised than to deceive so good a
commander with so slight so drunken and so indiscreet an
officer

IAGO
What was he that you followed with your sword
What had he done to you

CASSIO
I know not

IAGO
Ist possible

CASSIO

Drunk O God that men should put an enemy in their
mouths to steal away their brains Every inordinate cup is
unblessed and the ingredience is a devil

IAGO
Come come good Wine is a good familiar creature if it be
well used Exclaim no more against it

He cannot resist a quick grin to the Camera

IAGO
Exclaim more against it
And good Lieutenant I think you think I love you

CASSIO
I have well approved it sir I drunk

IAGO
You or any man living may be drunk at a time man Ill tell
you what you shall do Confess yourself freely to
Desdemona importune her Shell help to put you in your
place again This broken joint between you and her
husband entreat her to splinter and my fortunes against
any lay worth naming this crack of your love shall grow
stronger than it was before

CASSIO
You advise me well

IAGO
I protest in the sincerity of love and honest kindness

He offers his hand

CASSIO
I think it freely
Cassio accepts his hand and hauls him into an embrace
CLOSEUP on Lago who stares into the Camera
IAGO
(whispers)
And whats he then that says I play the villain
CASSIO

and betimes in the morning I will beseech the virtuous
Desdemona to undertake for me

They break apart

CASSIO
I am desperate of my fortunes if they check me here

IAGO
You are in the right Good night Lieutenant I must to the
watch

CASSIO

Good night honest Iago
With his hopes a little restored Cassio leaves

IAGO
(to Camera)

How am I then a villain
When this advice is free I give and honest
Probal to thinking and indeed the course to win the Moor
again
His soul is so enfettered to Desdemonas love
That she may make unmake do what she list
Even as her appetite shall play the god
With his weak function How am I then a villain
To counsel Cassio to this parallel course
Directly to his good Divinity of hell

He is drawn to the fire again

IAGO
When devils will the blackest sins put on
They do suggest at first with heavenly shows
As I do now For whiles this honest fool
Plies Desdemona to repair his fortunes
And she for him pleads strongly to the Moor
Ill pour this pestilence into his ear
That she repeals him for her bodys lust

He puts his hand on a charred log It sizzles slightly
IAGO

And by how much she strives to do him good
She shall undo her credit with the Moor
So will I turn her virtue into pitch
He draws his fingers down his face smearing it black

IAGO
And out of her own goodness make the net
That shall enmesh them all

He embraces himself His eyes closed in ecstasy Fade to black

The sound of panting The image returns as before as Iago opens his eyes

IAGO
How now Roderigo

He turns to see Roderigo battered and disheveled

RODERIGO
I do follow here in the chase not like a hound that hunts
but one that fills up the cry My money is almost spent I
have been tonight exceedingly well cudgeled and I think
the issue will be I shall have so much experience for my
pains and so with no money at all and a little more wit
return again to Venice

Seething he turns to leave

IAGO
(calling out)
How poor are they that have not patience

Roderigo stops but doesnt turn back

IAGO
What wound did ever heal but by degrees
Thou knowst we work by wit and not by witchcraft
And wit depends on dilatory time
Doest not go well

A faint gasp from Roderigo who is on the verge of tears

IAGO
Cassio hath beaten thee
And thou by that small hurt hath cashiered Cassio

Roderigo turns slowly back A grin breaks out on his face

IAGO
Content thyself awhile

He puts his arm round Roderigo Birds sing

IAGO
By th mass tis morning
Pleasure and action make the hours seem short
Retire thee awhile
Roderigo is sleepy and comfortable with his head resting on lagos shoulder Iago shrugs it off

IAGO
Away I say

Roderigo starts to speak

RODERIGO
Iago thou shalt know more hereafter

Roderigo tries again

RODERIGO
Iago Nay get thee gone

He goes Iago turns sharply to the Camera

IAGO
Two things are to be done

INT WINDING STAIRCASE — DAY

IAGO
(to Camera)
My wife must move for Cassio to her mistress Ill set her

EXT UPPER COLONNADE OF COURTYARD - DAY
Along upper colonnade moving along to stairway area

Jago straps on his sword as Cassio enters in the background

IAGO (VO)
Myself the while to draw the Moor apart
And bring him jump when he may Cassio find
Soliciting his wife

Cassio and Emilia approach as lago sets off past them

IAGO
Good morrow good Lieutenant

Cassio stops him for a moment

CASSIO

(softly)
IT humbly thank you

Iago smiles kisses Emilia firmly and hurries off

IAGO
(to Camera)
Ay thats the way
Dull not device by coldness and delay
EXT BATTLEMENTS - DAY

Othello and Montanos Men in battle-dress stand on the battlements overlooking a glassy sea
Othello turns aside and sniffs the peeled (and now brown) apple from the previous night As lago
arrives he conceals it

OTHELLO

INT BEDROOM - DAY

CASSIO

She opens the door Cassio takes her hand and kisses it Emilia appears in the doorway

EMILIA
Madam here comes my lord

CASSIO
Madan I take my leave

DESDEMONA
Why stay and hear me speak on thy behalf

CASSIO
Madan not now
Iam very ill at ease
Unfit for mine own purposes

Othello and Iago round a corner just Cassio disappears behind another

IAGO
(muttering)
Ha I like not that

OTHELLO
What dost thou say

IAGO
Nothing my lord

OTHELLO
Was not that Cassio parted from my wife

IAGO
Cassio my lord
Othello walks past Desdemona into their bedroom Iago follows and proceeds to take off Othellos
armour

DESDEMONA
How now my lord
I have been talking with a suitor here
A man that languishes in your displeasure

OTHELLO
Who ist you mean

DESDEMONA
Why your lieutenant Cassio

Othello throws a look at Iago who shrugs

DESDEMONA
Good my lord
If he be not one that truly loves you
I have no judgment in an honest face
I prithee call him back

OTHELLO
Went he hence now

DESDEMONA
Aye soothe so humbled
That he hath left part of his grief with me
To suffer with him Good love call him back

OTHELLO
Not now sweet Desdemona some other time

DESDEMONA
But shallt be shortly

OTHELLO
The sooner sweet for you

DESDEMONA
Shallt be tonight at supper

OTHELLO
No not tonight

DESDEMONA

(playfully)
Tomorrow dinner then

OTHELLO
I shall not dine at home
I meet the captains at the citadel

Othello has removed his armour She strokes and tickles his chest

DESDEMONA
Why then tomorrow night or Tuesday morn
On Tuesday noon or night on Wednesday morn
I prithee name the time but let it not
Exceed three days

She looks at him hopefully He feigns lack of interest

DESDEMONA
When shall he come

He looks at her blankly She slaps his chest

DESDEMONA
Tell me Othello

Again no response she starts to get riled

DESDEMONA
I wonder in my soul
What you would ask me that I should deny
Or stand so mammering on

He sighs concealing a grin

DESDEMONA
What Michael Cassio
That came a-wooing with you and so many a time
When I have spoke of you dispraisingly

Her baiting receives a mere raised eyebrow

DESDEMONA
Hath tane your part to have so much to do
To bring him in
(passions blazing)
Byr Lady I could do much

Othello breaks into laughter joined by Iago and Emilia

OTHELLO
Prithee no more Let him come when he will
I will deny thee nothing

She smiles coolly He goes to embrace her She pulls away

DESDEMONA
Why this is not a boon
Tis as I should entreat you wear your gloves
Or feed on nourishing dishes or keep you warm
Or sue to you to do a peculiar profit
To your own person Nay when I have a suit
Wherein I mean to touch your love indeed
It shall be full of poise and difficult weight
And fearful to be granted

Though playful the threat is meant Othello respects it with a considered reply

OTHELLO
I will deny thee nothing
They embrace warmly They look into each others eyes a calm level gaze of lovers and equals

OTHELLO
Whereon I do beseech thee grant me this
To leave me but a little to myself

DESDEMONA
Shall I deny you No farewell my lord

OTHELLO
Farewell my Desdemona Ill come to thee straight

DESDEMONA
Emilia come

He watches her as she goes elegant more woman now than child She turns at the door

DESDEMONA
Be as your fancies teach you
Whateer you be I am obedient

Her dignity belies any sense of servility She leaves and Emilia follows lago watches Othello
watching her

EXT CASTLE LAWN - DAY
SOLDIERS training

Jago and Othello work together Othello sees Desdemona watching and pulls off a fancy maneuver
for her benefit He blows her a kiss

OTHELLO
Excellent wretch Perdition catch my soul
But I do love thee
(to himself)
And when I love thee not
Chaos is come again

IAGO
My noble lord

OTHELLO
What dost thou say Iago

IAGO
Did Michael Cassio

When you wooed my lady know of your love

OTHELLO
He did from first to last

INT BATH —- DAY
Othello sloshes water over his face

OTHELLO
Why dost thou ask

IAGO
But for a satisfaction of my thought
No further harm

INT ARMOURY - DAY
Othello checks weapons

OTHELLO
Why of thy thought Iago

IAGO
I did not think he had been acquainted with her

OTHELLO
O yes and went between us very oft

IAGO
Indeed

OTHELLO
Indeed Ay indeed Discernst thou aught in that
Is he not honest

IAGO
Honest my lord

OTHELLO
Honest Ay honest

IAGO
My lord for aught I know

OTHELLO
What dost thou think

IAGO
Think my lord

OTHELLO
Think my lord By heaven he echoes me
Thou dost mean something If thou dost love me
Show me thy thought

IAGO
My lord you know I love you

OTHELLO
I think thou dost
And for I know thourt full of love and honesty
And weighst thy words before thou givst them breath
Therefore these stops of thine fright me the more

IAGO
For Michael Cassio
I dare be sworn I think that he is honest

OTHELLO
I think so too

IAGO
Men should be what they seem
Or those that be not would they might seem none

OTHELLO
Certain men should be what they seem

IAGO
Why then I think Cassios an honest man

OTHELLO
Nay yet theres more in this
I prithee speak to me as to thy thinkings
As thou dost ruminate and give thy worst of thoughts
The worst of words

IAGO
Good my lord pardon me
Utter my thoughts

OTHELLO
Thou dost conspire against thy friend Iago
If thou makst his ear a stranger to thy thoughts

IAGO
I do beseech you
Though I perchance am vicious in my guess-
As I confess it is my natures plague
To spy into abuses and oft my jealousy
Shapes faults that are not — I entreat you then
It were not for your quiet nor your good
Nor for my manhood honesty and wisdom
To let you know my thoughts

OTHELLO
What dost thou mean

IAGO
Good name in man and woman dear my lord
Is the immediate jewel of their souls
Who steals my purse steals trash Tis something nothing
Twas mine tis his and has been slave to thousands
But he that filches from me my good name
Robe me of that which not enriches him
And makes me poor indeed

OTHELLO
By heaven Ill know thy thoughts
IAGO
You cannot if my heart were in your hand
Nor shall not whilst tis in my custody
O beware my lord of jealousy
It is the green-eyed monster which doth mock
The meat it feeds on

OTHELLO
Why why is this
Thinkst thou Id make a life of jealousy
To follow still the changes of the moon
With fresh suspicions No to be once in doubt
Is once to be resolved Exchange me for a goat
When I shall turn the business of my soul
To such exsufflicate and blown surmises
Matching thy inference Tis not to make me jealous
To say my wife is fair feeds well loves company
Is free of speech sings plays and dances well
Where virtue is these are more virtuous No Iago
Ill see before I doubt when I doubt prove
And on the proof there is no more but this
Away at once with love or jealousy

IAGO
I am glad of this for now I shall have reason
To show the love and duty that I bear you
With franker spirit Therefore as I am bound
Receive it from me I speak not yet of proof
Look to your wife observe her well with Cassio
Look tot
I know our country disposition well
In Venice they do let Heaven see the pranks
They dare not show their husbands Their best conscience
Is not to leavet undone but keept unknown

OTHELLO
Dost thou say so

IAGO
She did deceive her father marrying you
And when she seemed to shake and fear your looks
She loved them most

OTHELLO
And so she did

IAGO
Why go to then
But I am much to blame
I humbly do beseech you of your pardon
For too much loving you

OTHELLO
I am bound to thee forever

IAGO
Isee this hath a little dashed your spirits

OTHELLO
Not a jot not a jot

IAGO
Ifaith I fear it has
I hope you will consider what is spoke
Comes from my love But I do see youre moved
I am to pray you not to strain my speech
To grosser issues nor to larger reach
Than to suspicion

OTHELLO
I will not

IAGO
Should you do so my lord
My speech should fall into such vile success
As my thoughts aimed not at Cassios my worthy friend —
My lord I see youre moved

OTHELLO
No not much moved
I do not think but Desdemonas honest

IAGO
Long live she so and long live you to think so

OTHELLO
And yet how nature erring from itself —

IAGO
Ay theres the point as to be bold with you
Not to enter into any marriage
Of her own clime complexion and degree
Whereto we see in all things nature tends —

Othello shuts his eyes in agony

INT CASTLE — FLASHBACK — NIGHT

Slow Motion Sequence The first night in Cyprus Desdemona dances surrounded by
VENETIANS All share striking Italianate looks wreathed in smiles

Foh one may smell in such a will most rank

Foul disproportion thoughts unnatural

Desdemona changes partner from Montano to Cassio

INT BEDROOM - EVENING

Othello opens his eyes He stands in front of a mirror and is dressed in Venetian finery Iago is
adjusting his ruff
IAGO (CONTD)
But pardon me I do not in position
Distinctly speak of her tho I may fear
Her will recoiling to her better judgment
May fall to match you with her country forma
And may perchance repent

OTHELLO
Farewell
If more thou dost perceive let me know more
Leave me Iago

IAGO
My lord I take my leave

He starts to leave but stops at the door and watches Othello

OTHELLO
(muttering)
Why did I marry

IAGO
(returning)
My lord I would I might entreat you honour
To scan this thing no farther Leave it to time
Let me be thought too busy in my fears
As worthy cause I have to fear I am —
And hold her free I do beseech your honor

OTHELLO
Fear not my government
That we can call these delicate creatures ours
And not their appetites

Iago goes Othello wrenches at his ruff to loosen it

INT CASTLE MAIN HALL — FLASHBACK -— NIGHT

Desdemona dancing among the VENETIANS She moves from Montanos arms into Cassios He
whispers in her ear a smile grows on her face

CROSSFADE TO

INT BEDROOM - NIGHT
Desdemona in a similar position and pose stands in the doorway smiling

DESDEMONA
How now my dear Othello
Your dinner and the generous islanders
By you invited do attend your presence

OTHELLO
Iam to blame
DESDEMONA
Why do you speak so faintly
Are you not well

She goes to him and sees that hes sweating She takes out her strawberry-spotted handkerchief
and mops his face He pushes it away and it drops to the floor

OTHELLO
Come Ill go in with you

He goes and Desdemona follows

DESDEMONA
Iam very sorry that you are not well

Emilia sees the handkerchief and picks it up She stares at it then pockets it

EXT CASTLE OVERLOOKING THE SEA - NIGHT

The night buzzes with insect noise

INT CASSIOS BEDROOM - NIGHT

IAGO
To have a foolish wife

EMILIA
O is that all What will you give me now
For that same handkerchief

IAGO
What handkerchief

EMILIA
What handkerchief
Why that the Moor first gave to Desdemona
That which so often you did bid me to steal

IAGO
(sudden interest)
Hast stolen it from her

EMILIA
No faith She let it drop by negligence

She reveals a corner of the handkerchief between her breasts He smiles and reaches for it but she
claps her hands over it

EMILIA
What will you do witht that you
Have been so earnest to have me filch it

He smiles and rolls her over onto her back She gasps at the roughness of the movement He leans
in close to her lips She relaxes and he snatches the handkerchief

IAGO
Why whats that to you Go leave me

He stares at her coldly Wounded she turns to go He grabs her spins her round and pushes her
face down onto the bed He pulls up her skirt and turns to the Camera

IAGO
(to Camera)
Trifles light as air
Are to the jealous confirmations strong
As proofs of holy writ This may do something

He tosses the handkerchief into the air

INT CASTLE — FLASHBACK FANTASY — NIGHT

The night of the dancing Desdemona smiling in Cassios arms Their faces move close together
He moves his mouth close to her ear and flicks his tongue into it

From amongst the VENETIANS behind them a head turns slowly to face the Camera It is
Brabantio his face deathly pale He slowly shakes his head

BRABANTIO
Look to her Moor if thou hast eyes to see
She has deceived her father and may thee
INT BEDROOM - NIGHT
Othellos eyes spring open

OTHELLO
My life upon her faith

He lies in bed with Desdemona sleeping by his side He gazes at her

OTHELLO
If she be false O then Heaven mocks itself
Ill not believe it

He shuts his eyes and is projected into another vision

INT BEDROOM -— FLASHBACK FANTASY - NIGHT

We follow the trail of Desdemonas discarded clothes- as Othello did on the previous night —
leading to the drapes around the four-poster bed A drape twitches A giggle A naked figure
behind the drape — and a second figure

Othellos hand stretches out in front of us to the bedside table and grabs a heavy candlestick His
other hand reaches out to part the curtains

INT BEDROOM - NIGHT

Othello sits in bed leaning over and staring intensely at the sleeping Desdemona His face is
running with sweat A bead of sweat drops from his chin to his shoulder More sweat runs down
his arm to his wrist in his shaking hand The candlestick

He drops it and it thuds against the floor Desdemona stirs and mumbles Eyes still closed she
stretches out her arm to Othello He dries his face on a pillow takes her hand and presses his lips
to her palm He sighs with relief and shuts his eyes

INT CASTLE — FLASHBACK FANTASY — NIGHT

Desdemonas arm is stretched over the bed fingers splayed as in their earlier love-scene
Groans of pleasure A hand reaches out to grasp her (as Othello did) This hand is white

INT BEDROOM - NIGHT

Othellos eyes flash open and he drops her hand in shock He gets up

EXT BEACH - DAY

Othello leaves the Castle In foreground lago stalks him

EXT BEACH - DAY
Jago sits hidden amongst the rocks

IAGO

(to Camera)
The Moor already changes with my poison
Dangerous conceits are in their natures poisons
Which at the first are scarce found to distaste
But with a little act upon the blood
Burn like the mines of sulphur I did say so
Look

He indicates Othello pacing on the shore
He joins Othello

IAGO
Not poppy nor mandragora
Nor all the drowsy syrups of the world
Shall ever medicine thee to that sweet sleep
Which thou owedst yesterday

IAGO
Why how now general No more of that

OTHELLO
Avaunt be gone Thou hast set me on the rack
I swear tis better to be much abused
Than but to knowt a little

IAGO
How now my lord

OTHELLO
What sense had I of her stolen hours of lust
I sawt not thought it not it harmed not me
I found not Cassios kisses on her lips

IAGO
lam sorry to hear this

OTHELLO
I had been happy if the general camp
Pioneers and all had tasted her sweet body
So I had nothing known O now for ever
Farewell the tranquil mind Farewell content
Farewell the plumed troops and the big wars
That make ambition virtue — O farewell
Farewell the neighing steed and the shrill trump
The spirit-stirring drum thear-piercing fife
The royal banner and all quality
Pride pomp and circumstance of glorious war
And O you mortal engines whose rude throats
Thimmortal Joves dread clamours counterfeit
Farewell Othellos occupations gone

IAGO
Ist possible my lord

Othello turns to lago

OTHELLO
Villain be sure thou prove my love a whore
Be sure of it Give me the ocular proof
Or by the worth of mine eternal soul
Thou hadst been better have been born a dog
Than answer my waked wrath

IAGO
Ist come to this
OTHELLO
Make as to seet or at the least so prove it
That the probation bear no hinge nor loop
To hang a doubt on — or woe upon thy life

Othello grabs lago by the throat

IAGO
My noble lord —

OTHELLO
It thou dost slander her and torture me
Never pray more abandon all remorse
On horrors head horrors accumulate
For nothing canst thou to damnation add
Greater than that

His grip has tightened He lets Iago drop Iago backs away gasping and spluttering

IAGO
O grace O heaven defend me
God buy you take mine office
To be direct and honest is not safe
I thank you for this profit and from hence
Tll love no friend sith love breeds such offense

He starts to leave

OTHELLO
Nay stay Thou shouldst be honest

IAGO
I should be wise for honestys a fool
And loses that it works for

OTHELLO
By the world
I think my wife be honest and think she is not
I think that thou art just and think thou art not
Ill have some proof
Would I were satisfied

IAGO
Isee sir you are eaten up with passion
I do repent me that I put it to you
You would be satisfied

OTHELLO
Would Nay I will

IAGO
And may But how How satisfied my lord
Would you the supervisor grossly gape on
Behold her topped

Othello punches him to the ground
OTHELLO
Death and damnation

Jago gets up and brushes off the sand

IAGO
It were a tedious difficulty I think
To bring them to that prospect Damn them then
What shall I say Wheres satisfaction
It is impossible you should see this
Were they as prime as goats as hot as monkeys

Othello grabs him again

IAGO
But yet I say
If imputation and strong circumstances
Which lead directly to the door of truth
Will give you satisfaction you might have it

OTHELLO
Give me a living reason shes disloyal

IAGO
I do not like the office
But sith I am entered in this cause so far
Pricked to it by foolish honesty and love
I will go on I lay with Cassio lately
And being troubled with a raging tooth
I could not sleep
There are a kind of men so loose of soul
That in their sleeps will mutter their affairs
One of this kind is Cassio
In sleep I heard him say Sweet Desdemona
Lot us be wary let us hide our loves

Othello sinks onto the sand The sea laps at their ankles

IAGO
And then air would he grip and wring my hand
Cry O sweet creature and then kiss me hard
As if he plucked up kisses by the roots
That grow upon my lips then laid his leg
Over my thigh

Jago illustrates placing his own leg lightly over Othellos
IAGO
And sighed and kissed and then
Cried

Cursed fate that gave thee to the Moor

Othello pulls away and gets to his feet

OTHELLO
O monstrous

IAGO
Nay this was but his dream

OTHELLO
Monstrous

IAGO
Nay yet be wise yet we see nothing done
She may be honest yet Tell me but this
Have you not sometimes seen a handkerchief
Spotted with strawberries in your wifes hand

OTHELLO
I gave her such a one twas my first gift

IAGO
I know not that but such a handkerchief —
Iam sure it was your wifes — did I today
See Cassio wipe his beard with

OTHELLO
If it be that
INT CASSIOS BEDROOM - DAY
Cassios hand catches the strawberry-spotted handkerchief in mid-air
Intrigued he holds it up against the morning sunlight
He places it on a bed-post He kisses the sleeping Bianca
Meanwhile we hear the following

DESDEMONA (VO)
Where should I lose that handkerchief Emilia

EMILIA (VO)
I know not madam

DESDEMONA (VO)
Believe me I had rather lose my purse

CUT BACK TO
Full of crusadoes and but my noble Moor

Is true of mind and made of no such baseness
As jealous creatures are it were enough

To put him to ill thinking

EMILIA (VO)
Is he not jealous

INT BEDROOM - DAY
Desdemona still in her night-dress rummages through her clothes Their conversation continues

DESDEMONA
Who he I think the sun where he was born
Drew all such humours from him

She turns and is startled to see standing in the doorway

DESDEMONA
How ist with you my lord

OTHELLO
Well my good lady How do you Desdemona

DESDEMONA
Well my good lord

OTHELLO
Give me your hand This hand is moist my lady

DESDEMONA
It has felt no age nor known no sorrow

OTHELLO
This argues fruitfulness and liberal heart
Hot hot and moist This hand of yours requires
A sequester from liberty fasting and prayer
Much castigation exercise devout
For theres a young and sweating devil here
That commonly rebels Tis a good hand
A frank one

DESDEMONA
You may indeed say so
For twas that hand that gave away my heart
Come now your promise

OTHELLO
What promise chuck

DESDEMONA
I have bid Cassio come speak to you

He drops her hand putting his own to his forehead

OTHELLO
Ihave a salt and sorry rheum offends me
Lend me that handkerchief

DESDEMONA
Here my lord

She offers a plain white handkerchief

OTHELLO
That which I gave you

DESDEMONA
I have it not about me

OTHELLO
Not

DESDEMONA
No faith my lord

OTHELLO
Thats a fault That handkerchief
Did an Egyptian to my mother give
She was a charmer and could almost read
The thoughts of people she told her while she kept it
Twould make her amiable and subdue my father
Entirely to her love her but if she lost it
Or made a gift of it my fathers eye
Should hold her loathly and his spirits should hunt
After new fancies she dying gave it me
And bid me when my fate would have me wive
I give it her I did so and take heed on it
Make it a darling like your precious eye
To lose it or givet away were such perdition
As nothing else could match

DESDEMONA
Ist possible

She is caught up in the intensity of his staring eyes

OTHELLO
Tie true Theres magic in the web of it
The worms were hallowed that did breed the silk
And it was dyed in mummy which the skillful
Conserved of maidens hearts

DESDEMONA
I faith ist true

OTHELLO
Most veritable therefore look to it well

DESDEMONA
Then would to God I had never seen it

OTHELLO
SBlood

DESDEMONA
Why do you speak so startlingly and rash

OTHELLO
Ist lost Ist gone Speak ist out of thway

DESDEMONA
Heaven bless us

OTHELLO
Say you

DESDEMONA

It is not lost but what and if it were

OTHELLO
How

DESDEMONA
I say it in not lost

OTHELLO
Fetch it let me see it

DESDEMONA
Why so I can sir but I will not now
This is a trick to put me from my suit
Pray you let Cassio be received again

OTHELLO
Fetch me my handkerchief My mind misgives

DESDEMONA
Come come
Youll never meet a more sufficient man

OTHELLO
The handkerchief

DESDEMONA
I pray talk me of Cassio

OTHELLO
The handkerchief

DESDEMONA
A man that all his time
Hath founded his good fortunes on your love
Shared dangers with you —

OTHELLO
The handkerchief

DESDEMONA
Ifaith you are to blame
OTHELLO
Zounds

Othello storms out Iago stands unseen outside the door

EMILIA
Is not this man jealous

DESDEMONA
I neer saw this before

Emilia catches sight of lago retreating down the corridor

EMILIA
‘Tis not a year or two shows us a man

Jago is meant to hear this and he does He turns to look at her

EMILIA
They are all but stomachs and we all but food
They eat us hungerly and when they are full
They belch us

Jago turns away and goes

DESDEMONA
Something sure of state
Hath puddled his clear spirit

EMILIA
(turning back into the room)
Pray heaven it be and no conception
Nor no jealous toy concerning you

DESDEMONA
Alas the day I never gave him cause

EMILIA
But jealous souls will not be answered so
They are not ever jealous for the cause
But jealous for theyre jealous Tis a monster
Begot upon itself born on itself

DESDEMONA
Heaven keep that monster from Othellos mind

EMILIA
Lady amen

And many worthy and chaste dames even thus
All guiltless meet reproach

The sound of footsteps lago bends dawn to Othello

IAGO
What ho my lord
My lord I say Othello

Cassio arrives

CASSIO
Whats the matter

IAGO
My Lord is fallen into an epilepsy
This is his second fit he had one yesterday

CASSIO
Rub him about the temples

Cassio moves towards Othello but lago leads him outside

IAGO

(whispering)
No forbear
The lethargy must have his quiet course
If not he foams at mouth and by and by
Breaks out to savage madness Look he stirs
Do you withdraw yourself a little while
He will recover straight When he is gone
I would on great occasion speak with you

An Cassio goose Othello sits bolt upright and states at the Camera for the first time

OTHELLO
(to Camera)
Did he confess it

Jago startled flicks a suspicious look at the Camera

IAGO
How is it general Have you not hurt your head

OTHELLO
Dost thou mock me

Tago helps him up and dusts him off

IAGO
I mock you No by heaven Good sir
Whilst you were here oer whelmed with your grief
Cassio came hither
Othello looks about wildly

IAGO
I shifted him away
And laid good scuse upon your ecstasy
Bade him anon return and here speak with me
The which he promised Do but encave yourself
And mark the jeers the gibes and notable scorns
That dwell in every region of his face
For I will make him tell the tale anew
Where how how oft how long ago and when
He hath and is again to cope your wife
Marry patience

Othello is on the verge of erupting The sound of footsteps

Lago hushes him and bundles him in to a cell with a DERANGED PRISONER He locks the door
Jago sighs with relief and whispers to the Camera

IAGO
Now will I question Cassio of Bianca
He when he hears of her cannot refrain
From the excess of laughter

Cassio is almost upon him Iago gets even quieter

IAGO
As he shall smile Othello shall go mad

Through the bars of his cell Othello looks into the Camera again The Prisoner studies him close
by

Jago greets Cassio

IAGO
How do you now lieutenant

CASSIO
The worser that you give me that same title
Whose want even kills me

IAGO
Ply Desdemona well and you are sure ont

Now if this suit lay in Biancas power
How quickly should you speed

Alas poor wretch

Othello turns to his fellow prisoner

OTHELLO
Look how he laughs already
CASSIO

IAGO
She gives it out that you shall marry her
Do you intend it

Cassio laughs heartily

CASSIO

BIANCA
Whence came this This is some token from a newer friend

CASSIO

CASSIO

BIANCA
A likely story that you should find it in your chamber and

One is too poor too weak for my revenge

A fine woman a fair woman a sweet woman

Ay let her rot and perish and be damned tonight for she
shall not live
No my heart is turned to stone I strike it and
It hurts my hand But yet the pity of it

Tis gone
Arise black vengeance from thy hollow cell
Yield up O love thy crown and hearted throne
To tyrannous hate Now by yond marble heaven
In the due reverence of a sacred vow
I here engage my words

Kneeling he takes out a dagger and cuts the of his hand He starts to rise but lago holds him
down

IAGO
Do not rise yet
Witness you ever-burning lights above

You elements that clip us round about

Witness that here Iago doth give up

The execution of his wit hands heart

To wronged Othellos service Let him command
And to obey shall be in me remorse

What bloody business ever

He takes Othellos knife and cuts his own palm

Othello clasps lagos bleeding hand to his Blood runs down their arms They both rise

which falls to the floor

OTHELLO
Fire and brimstone

DESDEMONA

OTHELLO
Are you wise

Desdemona turns to Othello His head is buried in the letter

DESDEMONA

Deputing Cassio in his government

If that the earth could teem with womens tears
Each drops she falls would prove a crocodile
Out of my sight

Are his wits safe Is he not light of brain

IAGO
Hes that he is I may not breathe my censure
What he may be

LODOVICO

IAGO
(with great sadness)
Faith that was not so well yet would I knew
That stroke would prove the worst

LODOVICO
Iam sorry that I am deceived in him

INT BEDROOM - NIGHT
Emilia sits on a chair Othello prowls around her

OTHELLO
You have seen nothing then

EMILIA
Nor ever heard nor ever did suspect

OTHELLO
Yes you have seen Cassio and she together

He moves in close to scrutinize her face She battles to keep her composure

EMILIA
But then I saw no harm and then I heard
Each syllable that breath made up between them

OTHELLO
What did they never whisper

EMILIA
Never my lord
I durst my lord to wager she is honest
Lay down my soul at stake If you think other
Remove your thought it doth abuse your bosom

OTHELLO
Bid her come hither go
(to Camera)
This is a subtle whore

INT BEDROOM - NIGHT

DESDEMONA
What is your pleasure

OTHELLO

Let me see your eyes
Look in my face

He grasps her face in his hands

DESDEMONA
What horrible fancys this

OTHELLO
What art thou

DESDEMONA
Your wife my lord your true and loyal wife

OTHELLO
Come swear it

He grabs her by the hair and

INT CHAPEL - NIGHT
forces her to her knees by the altar

OTHELLO
Damn thyself
Swear thou art honest
Heaven doth truly know it

Othello reaches for his dagger

OTHELLO
Heaven truly knows thou art false as hell

She looks up at him unaware of his outstretched arm

DESDEMONA
To whom my lord With whom How am I false

His hand curls into a fist and he pushes her towards the door

OTHELLO
Ah Desdemona away away away

He collapses onto the ground in tears She gathers him up and hugs him in her arms

DESDEMONA
Alas the heavy day Why do you weep
Am I the motive of these tears my lord

She kisses him about the face

OTHELLO
Had it pleased heaven
To try me with affliction had they rained
All kind of sores and shames on my bare head
I should have found in some place of my soul
A drop of patience
But alas there where I have garnered up my heart
Where either I must live or bear no life
The fountain from the which my current runs
Or else dries up — to be discarded thence
Or keep it as a cistern for foul toads
To knot and gender in
O thou who art so lovely fair and smellst
So sweet that the sense aches at thee
Would thou hadst neer been born

She recoils in shock

DESDEMONA
Alas what ignorant sin have I committed
He grabs her by the hair and pulls her head back

OTHELLO
Was this fair paper this most goodly book
Made to write whore upon What committed
Impudent strumpet

He kisses her forcefully pins her down and molests her

DESDEMONA
By heaven you do me wrong

OTHELLO
Are you not a strumpet

DESDEMONA
No as I am a Christian
If to preserve this vessel for my lord
From any hated foul unlawful touch
Be not to be a strumpet I am none

OTHELLO
What Not a whore

DESDEMONA
No and I shall be saved

OTHELLO
Ist possible

DESDEMONA
O heaven forgive us
He releases her and straightens her dress

OTHELLO
I cry you mercy then
I took you for that cunning whore of Venice
That married with Othello

He shouts at the door

OTHELLO
You mistress
That have the office opposite to Saint Peter
And keeps the gate of hell

Emilia enters tentatively

OTHELLO
You you ay you
We have done our course

He presses coins into her hands which fall to the floor

OTHELLO
theres money for your pains
I pray you turn the key and keep our counsel

He winks at her and leaves Emilia rushes over to Desdemona

EMILIA
How do you madam How do you my good lady

DESDEMONA

(faintly)
Faith half-asleep

EMILIA
Good madam whats the matter with my lord

DESDEMONA
With who

EMILIA
Why with my lord madam

DESDEMONA
Who is thy lord

EMILIA
He that is yours sweet lady

DESDEMONA
T have none Do not talk to me Emilia
I cannot weep nor answers have I none
But what should go by water Prithee tonight
Lay on my bed my wedding sheets remember
And call thy husband hither
INT CHAPEL - NIGHT
Desdemona stands by the window staring at the bright moon She bites back tears

DESDEMONA
Am I that name Iago

IAGO
What name fair lady

DESDEMONA
Such as my lord did say I was

EMILIA
He called her whore

IAGO
Why did he so

DESDEMONA
I do not know I am sure I am none such

IAGO
Do not weep do not weep Alas the day

EMILIA
Has she forsook so many noble matches
Her father and her country all her friends
To be calld whore would it not make one weep

DESDEMONA
It is my wretched fortune

IAGO
Beshrew him for it
How comes this trick upon him

DESDEMONA
Nay heaven doth know O good Iago
What shall I do to win my lord again
Good friend go to him for by this light of heaven
I know not how I lost him Here I kneel

She kneels in front of the altar-piece Iago closes the shutters

DESDEMONA
If eer my will did trespass gainst his love
Either in discourse of thought or actual deed
Or that mine eyes mine ears or any sense
Delighted them in any other form
Or that I do not yet and ever did
And ever will — though he do shake me off
To beggarly divorcement — love him dearly
Comfort forswear me Unkindness may do much
And his unkindness may defeat my life
But never taint my love I cannot say whore
It does abhor me now I speak the word

To do the act that might the addition earn

Not the worlds mass of vanity could make me

She sobs again lago gets to his knees to comfort her

IAGO
I pray you be content tis but his humour
The business of the state does him offense
And he does chide with you

DESDEMONA
If twere no other —

IAGO
It is but so I warrant

Trumpets sound He raises her up and embraces her

IAGO
Hark how these instruments summon to supper
The messengers of Venice stay the meat
Go in and weep not all things shall be well

INT CHAPEL — NIGHT

As Desdemona and Emilia move away Iago is suddenly pulled to one side He is banged against
the wall and a sword-point is pressed to his throat

IAGO
How now Roderigo

RODERIGO
I do not find that thou dealst justly with me

IAGO
What in the contrary

RODERIGO
Every day thou daffst me with some device

Jago tries to speak

RODERIGO
I will indeed no longer endure it
Nor am I yet persuaded to put up in peace what
already I have foolishly suffered

He presses harder with the sword-point

IAGO
Will you hear me Roderigo

RODERIGO
Faith I have heard too much for your
Words and performance are no kin together

IAGO
You charge me most unjustly

RODERIGO
With naught but truth I have wasted myself out of my
means The jewels you have had from me to deliver to
Desdemona would half have corrupted a nun You have
told me she hath received them and returned me
expectations and comforts of sudden respect and
acquaintance but I find none

Jago pushes the sword away

IAGO
Well go to very well

Roderigo pulls him back and slaps him

RODERIGO
Very well go to I cannot go to man nor ‘tis not very well
By this hand I say tis very scurvy and begin to find myself
fopped in it

He slaps lago again

IAGO
(coolly)
Very well

RODERIGO
I tell you tis not very well I will make myself known to
Desdemona

Roderigo pulls off his false beard lago turns slowly back

RODERIGO
If she will return me my jewels I will give over my suit and
repent my unlawful solicitation if not assure yourself I
will seek satisfaction of you

IAGO
You have said now

RODERIGO
Ay and said nothing but what I protest intendment of
doing

He sets off after Desdemona Iago swings him back

IAGO
Why now I see theres mettle in thee and even from this
instant do build on thee a better opinion than ever before
Give me thy hand Roderigo Thou hast taken against me a
most just exception but yet I protest I have dealt most
justly in thy affair
He leads him away from the door

Iago smiles

RODERIGO
It hath not appeared

IAGO
I grant it hath not appeared and your suspicions are not
without wit and judgment But Roderigo if thou hast that
in thee indeed which I have greater reason to believe now
than ever — I mean purpose courage and valour — this
night show it If thou the next night following enjoy not
Desdemona take me from this world and devise engines for
my life

RODERIGO
Well what is it

Iago hushes him

RODERIGO
Why then Othello and Desdemona return again to Venice

IAGO
Unless his abode be lingered here by some accident
wherein none can be so determinate as the removing of
Cassio

RODERIGO
(nervously)
How do you mean removing of him

IAGO
Why by making him incapable of Othellos place —
knocking out his brains

RODERIGO
And that you would have me to do

IAGO
Ay if you dare do yourself profit and a right I will be near
to second your attempt Come stand not amazed at it but
go along with me I will show you such a necessity in his
death that you shall think yourself bound put it on him

RODERIGO
I will hear further reason for this

And you shall be satisfied

INT BEDROOM - NIGHT
Desdemona slips into a steaming bath

DESDEMONA

My mother had a maid called Barbary
She was in love and he she loved proved mad
And did forsake her She had a song of willow
An old thing twas but it expressed her fortune
And she died singing it That song tonight
Will not go from my mind

(sings)
The poor soul sat sighing by a sycamore tree
Sing all a green willow
Her hand on her bosom her head on her knee
Sing willow willow willow
The fresh streams ran by her and murmured her moans
Sing willow willow willow

EXT BEACH - NIGHT

Othellos still silhouette amongst a patch of reeds thrashed by a fierce wind He looks out to sea
at the billowing waves

He turns away and moves inland
Throughout

DESDEMONA

(singing VO)
Her salt tears fell from her and softened the stones
Sing willow willow willow
Prithee hie thee hell come anon
Sing all a green willow must be my garland
Let nobody blame him his scorn I approve
Nay thats not next

INT BEDROOM - NIGHT
Desdemona is now in her night-dress

DESDEMONA
Hark who ist that knocks

EMILIA
It is the wind

DESDEMONA
This Lodovico is a proper man

EMILIA
A very handsome man

DESDEMONA
He speaks well

EMILIA
I know a lady in Venice who would have walked barefoot
to Palastine for a touch of his nether lip

DESDEMONA
(sings)
I called my love false love but what said he then
Sing willow willow willow
If I court more women youll couch with more men

She gets into bed
DESDEMONA

So get thee gone good night I do not think there is any
such woman
Emilia starts to leave

DESDEMONA
Mine eyes do itch — Does that bode weeping

EMILIA
(hovering at the door)
‘Tis neither here nor there

DESDEMONA
T have heard it said so O these men these men
Dost thou in conscience think — tell me Emilia
That there be women do abuse their husbands
In such gross kind

EMILIA
(returning)
There be some such no question

DESDEMONA
Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world

EMILIA
Why would not you

DESDEMONA
No by this heavenly light

EMILIA
Nor I by this heavenly light
I might dot as well ithdark

They laugh

DESDEMONA
Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world

EMILIA
The worlds a huge thing it is a great price for a small vice

DESDEMONA
In troth I think thou wouldst not

EMILIA
In troth I think I should and undot again when I had
done it For the whole world uds pity who would not
make her husband a cuckold to make him a monarch I
should venture purgatory for it

DESDEMONA
I do not think there is any such woman

EMILIA
Yes a dozen
They laugh Desdemona falls silent apparently distracted Emilia rolls her onto the bed and
begins to rub oil into her back

EMILIA
But I do think it is their husbands faults
If wives do fall Say that they slack their duties
And pour our treasures into foreign laps
O else break out in peevish jealousies
Throwing restraint upon us or say they strike us
Why we have galls and though we have some grace
Yet have we some revenge Let husbands know
Their wives have sense like them They see and smell
And have their palates both for sweet and sour
As husbands have What is it that they do
When they change us for others Is it sport
I think it is And doth affection breed it
I think it doth Ist frailty that thus errs
I think so too And have not we affections
Desires for sport and frailty as man have
Then lot them use us well else let them know
The ills we do their ills instruct us so

Desdemonas eyes are shut Emilia gets up gently Desdemona takes her hand and kisses it

DESDEMONA
Good night good night

Emilia kisses her on the head and goes

Desdemona settles into the bed

INT CASTLE COLONNADE - NIGHT

Roderigo hovers nervously in a colonnade He hears running feet and hides behind a pillar He is
startled by lago arriving from the opposite side Iago gives him a nod and starts to withdraw
Roderigo grabs him

RODERIGO
Be near at hand I may miscarry in it

IAGO
Here at thy hand be bold and take thy stand

Jago slips behind the next pillar and pulls out his dagger

RODERIGO
(muttering)
Tis but a man gone Forth my sword

Roderigo takes out his rapier

IAGO
(to Camera)
If Cassio do remain
He hath a daily beauty in his life
That makes me ugly and beside the moor
May unfold me to him there stand I in much peril
No he must die

Sound of footsteps approaching Cassio walks past Roderigos pillar Roderigo moves out Cassio
spots his shadow just before Roderigos lunge

RODERIGO
Villain thou diest

Cassio turns to face him and draws his sword lago peers out from behind his pillar Roderigo
lunges again but Cassio parries him

Jago strikes at Cassios back At the same time Cassio lunges at Roderigo wounding him in the
stomach Missing Cassios back lagos knife slices down and into the back of Cassios log lago

rolls away and runs off into the shadows

Hearing them Cassios voice finds new power

CASSIO

LODOVICO
Hark

They move cautiously in Cassios direction

RODERIGO
O wretched villain

Hearing this cry from another direction they start to withdraw but are halted by the arrival of
Jago in his night-shirt carrying a torch and dagger

IAGO
Whos there Whose noise is this that cries on murder

LODOVICO

IAGO
Did not you hear a cry

CASSIO

O treacherous villains

He calls out to Lodovico and Gratiano

IAGO
What are you there Come in and give some help

RODERIGO

(faintly)
O help me here

CASSIO
Thats one of them

Jago finds Roderigo crumpled behind a pillar

He helps him up and smiles at him Then he clamps one hand over his mouth and with the other
plunges his dagger deep into his gut He pulls it forcefully upwards lifting Roderigo off the
ground

IAGO

(loudly)
O murderous slave O villain

Roderigo clings onto lago and as he sinks down stares into his eyes and whispers

RODERIGO
O damned Iago O inhuman dog

Jago looks blankly at the Camera then turns away

IAGO
(shouting)
Where be these bloody thieves

He moves up behind Cassio Looking about he sees no one is watching He raises his dagger to
strike

Hearing footsteps he hides his dagger and spins round shouting

IAGO
Ho murder murder

The figures of Lodovico and Gratiano emerge from the shadows

INT BEDROOM - NIGHT

OTHELLO
(whispers to Camera)
It is the cause it is the cause my soul

He stands by the window holding a candle The shutters are slightly ajar and he looks out into the
night

OTHELLO
Let me not name it to you you chaste stars
It is the cause

He closes the shutters and turns to the sleeping Desdemona

OTHELLO
Yet Ill not shed her blood
Nor scar that whiter skin of hers than snow
And smooth as monumental alabaster
Yet she must die else shell betray more men
Put out the light and then put out the light
If I quench thee thou flaming minister
I can again thy former light restore
Should I repent me but once put out thy light
Thou cunningst pattern of excelling nature
I know not where is that Promethean heat
That can thy light relume When I have plucked thy rose
I cannot give it vital growth again
It needs must wither Ill smell it on the tree

He leans in close to her Her breathing is slow and steady He kisses her lips His voice grows
even fainter

OTHELLO
O balmy breath that doth almost persuade
Justice to break her sword One more one more

He kisses her again

OTHELLO
Be thus when thou art dead and I will kill thee
And love thee after
One more and this the last
So sweet was neer so fatal

He emits a sudden sob She stirs he moves swiftly away

DESDEMONA
Whos there

Othello

OTHELLO
Ay Desdemona

DESDEMONA
Will you come to bed my lord

OTHELLO

Have you prayed tonight Desdemona
DESDEMONA

Ay my lord
OTHELLO

If you bethink yourself of any crime
Unreconciled as yet to heaven and grace
Solicit for it straight

DESDEMONA
Alas my lord what may you mean by that

OTHELLO
Well do it and be brief I will walk by
I would not kill thy unprepared spirit
No — heaven forfend — I would not kill thy soul

DESDEMONA
Talk you of killing

OTHELLO
Ay I do

DESDEMONA
Then heaven
Have mercy on me

OTHELLO
Amen with all my heart

DESDEMONA
If you say so I hope you will not kill me
And yet I fear you
Some mortal passion shakes your very frame

OTHELLO
Think on thy sins

DESDEMONA
They are loves I bear to you

OTHELLO
And for that thou diest

DESDEMONA
That deaths unnatural that kills for loving

She tries to take hold of him He barks

OTHELLO
Peace and be still

DESDEMONA
I will so Whats the matter

OTHELLO
That handkerchief which I so loved and gave thee Thou
gavst to Cassio

DESDEMONA
No by my life and soul
Send for the man and ask him

OTHELLO
Sweet soul take heed
Take heed of perjury Thou art on thy death-bed

DESDEMONA
Ay but not yet to die

OTHELLO
Yes presently

DESDEMONA

Then Lord have mercy on me

OTHELLO

DESDEMONA

And have you mercy too I never did
Offend you in my life never loved Cassio
But with such general warranty of heaven
As I might love I never gave him token

OTHELLO
By heaven I saw my handkerchief in his hand
O perjured woman

DESDEMONA
He found it then
I never gave it him Send for him hither
Let him confess a truth

OTHELLO
He hath confessed

Desdemona is struck dumb with shock

DESDEMONA

into the drapes

He throws her down again and fixes her with a stare

DESDEMONA
Kill me tomorrow let me live tonight

He moves slowly towards her She slaps him He keeps advancing she backs away He springs at
her She evades him but he catches her ankles and pulls her towards him She tries to wrestle but
he pins her down and pulls his body on top of hers

OTHELLO
Nay if you strive —

DESDEMONA
But half an hour

OTHELLO
Being done there is no pause

He picks up a pillow she writhes beneath him

OTHELLO
But while I say one prayer

OTHELLO
It is too late
She stops fighting and looks into his eyes her own eyes glistening She closes them and a tear runs
down her cheek as she stretches up to kiss him He presses the pillow to her mouth For a moment
there is no resistance

Behind them fire starts to climb the drapes Her arms are wrapped around him one of her hands
finds his face and strokes it shakily The hand starts to shake more violently and pull at his skin
He plucks it off She tears at his shirt He grabs her hand Their fingers entwine tightly

OTHELLO
O Lord Lord Lord

He body bucks beneath him but the pillow stays firmly in place The struggling stops He rolls off
her and lies by her side He sees the gathering fire and stares at it motionless He sees the horned
carving in the wall The flickering light lends it animation He gets up calmly goes to the bath-tub
full of water and empties it over the fire Darkness The extinct fire is still hissing when he hears a
voice

VOICE
My lord my lord What ho My lord my lord

OTHELLO
What not dead Not yet quite dead

He picks up the pillow again

VOICE
What ho My lord my lord

OTHELLO
Whos there

VOICE
O good my lord I would speak a word with you

OTHELLO
Yes — Emilia — by and by

A slice of moonlight as Othello opens a shutter The light catches Desdemona on the bed

OTHELLO
Still as the grave
(he turns to the Camera)
Shall she come in Weret good
I think she stirs again No Whats best
If she come in shell sure speak to my wife
My wife my wife What wife I have no wife

He cradles her

EMILIA
I do beseech you
That I may speak with you O good my lord

OTHELLO
I had forgot thee Emilia Soft by and by
He gently replaces Desdemona and straightens the bedsheets He pulls a drape across to conceal
the bed He goes to the shutter Darkness The sound of unbolting and there is another thin slice of
light as the door is opened Othello leans his head round the door

OTHELLO
Whats the matter with thee now

EMILIA
O my good lord yonders foul murder done

OTHELLO
What Now

EMILIA
But now my lord

OTHELLO
It is the very error of the moon
She comes more nearer earth than she was wont
And makes men mad

EMILIA
Cassio my lord hath killed a young Venetian
Called Roderigo

OTHELLO
Roderigo killed
And Cassio killed

EMILIA
No Cassio is not killed

Emilia sees a little stream of water trickling out under the door She tries to look behind Othello

OTHELLO
Not Cassio killed Then murders out of tune
And sweet revenge grows harsh

DESDEMONA
(faintly)
O falsely falsely murdered

EMILIA
O Lord What cry is that

OTHELLO
That What

EMILIA
Out and alas that was my ladys voice

She pushes past Othello and past the drape to Desdemona
EMILIA

Help help ho help O lady speak again
Sweet Desdemona o sweet mistress speak
DESDEMONA
A guiltless death I die

EMILIA
O who has done this deed

Othello stands at the end of the bed She looks up at him

DESDEMONA
Nobody I myself Farewell
Commend me to my kind lord O farewell

She dies Silence
Emilia gets to her feet and heads for the door Othello steps into her path

OTHELLO
Why how should she be murdered

EMILIA
Alas who knows

She tries to move round him but he wont let her

OTHELLO
You heard her say herself it was not I

EMILIA
She said so I must needs report the truth

He moves aside She gets to the door

OTHELLO
Shes like a liar gone to burning hell
Twas I that killed her

She turns back

EMILIA
O the more angel she
And you the blacker devil

OTHELLO
She turned to folly and she was a whore

EMILIA
Thou dost belie her and thou are a devil

OTHELLO
She was false as water

EMILIA
Thou art rash as fire to say
That she was false O she was heavenly true

OTHELLO
Cassio did top her Ask thy husband else
O I were damned beneath all depth in hell
But that I did proceed upon just grounds
To this extremity Thy husband knew it all

EMILIA
My husband

OTHELLO
Thy husband

EMILIA

That she was false to wedlock

OTHELLO
Ay with Cassio Nay had she been true —

EMILIA
My husband

OTHELLO
Ay twas he that told me on her first

EMILIA
My husband

OTHELLO
What needs this iterance woman I say thy husband

EMILIA
O mistress villainy hath made mocks with love My
husband say that she was false

OTHELLO
He woman
I say thy husband Dost understand the word
My friend thy husband honest honest Iago

EMILIA
If he say so may his pernicious soul
Rot half a grain a day He lies to the heart
She was too fond of her filthy bargain

Othello snatches his battle-scarred sword from the wall
Emilia doesnt flinch

EMILIA
Do thy worst This deed of thine is no more
Worthy heaven than thou wast worthy her
Help Murder

OTHELLO
(raising his sword)
Peace you were best

EMILIA
Thou hast not half the power to do me harm
As I have to be hurt O gull O dolt

As ignorant as dirt Thou hast done a deed —

I care not for thy sword — Ill make thee known
Though I lost twenty lives Help Help Ho help
The Moor hath killed my mistress Murder murder

Othello drops the sword and Emilia runs for the door but is met by Montano Gratiano and Iago

MONTANO
What is the matter How now general

Othello stands rigid and staring

EMILIA
O are you come Iago You have done well
That men must lay their murders on your neck

GRATIANO
What is the matter

EMILIA
Disprove this villain if thou best a man
He says thou toldst him that his wife was false
I know thou didst not thourt not such a villain
Speak for my heart is full

All eyes but Othellos turn to Iago
IAGO

I told him what I thought and told no more
Than what he found himself was apt and true

EMILIA

But did you ever tell him she was false
IAGO

I did
EMILIA

You told a lie an odious damned lie
Upon my soul a lie a wicked lie

She false with Cassio Did you say with
Cassio

IAGO
With Cassio mistress Go to charm your tongue

EMILIA
I will not charm my tongue I am bound to speak My
mistress here lies murdered in her bed
She pulls the drape aside to reveal Desdemonas body

The WITNESSES are horrified

EMILIA
And your reports have set the murder on
OTHELLO
Nay stare not masters it is true indeed

EMILIA
Villainy villainy villainy
I think upon it I think — I smellt — O villainy

IAGO
What are you mad I charge you get you home

He tries to push her out Othello looks across at him

EMILIA
Good gentlemen lot me have leave to speak
Tin proper I obey him but not now
Perchance Iago I will neer go home

OTHELLO
o1oo

Othello falls onto the bed

EMILIA
Nay lay thee down and roar
For thou hast killed the sweetest innocent
That eer did lift up eye

OTHELLO
(leaping up again)
Or she was foul Iago knows
That she with Cassio hath the act of shame
A thousand times committed Cassio confessed it
And she did gratify his amorous works
With that same handkerchief I saw it in his hand

EMILIA
O god O heavenly God

She turns to ago

IAGO
Be wise and get you home

EMILIA
I will not

Jago draws his sword on Emilia All eyes turn to lago
EMILIA
O thou dull moor that handkerchief thou speakst of
I found by fortune and did give my husband

IAGO
Filth thou liest

EMILIA
By heaven I do not I do not gentlemen I found it —
OTHELLO

Are there no stones in heaven

But what serves for thunder Precious villain

Othello picks up his sword and runs at lago Montano intercepts and disarms him

Jago puts a dagger to Emilias throat and drags her to the door He threatens her to stop the
others advancing

As he runs out of the room he stabs her in the back

Emilia stands still for a moment then topples to the ground blood running from her wound
Gratiano rushes to her side Montano and SOLDIERS go in pursuit of lago

EMILIA
Lay me by my mistress side

They do so

INT MAIN HALL - NIGHT

Jago sprints across the main hall scrabbling over a table He pushes past a couple of bemused
SOLDIERS and out of the door Montano follows

EXT BATTLEMENTS - NIGHT

Iago runs as Montano and his men chase him

INT CORRIDOR HIGH UP IN THE CASTLE —- NIGHT

Jago running the sound of footsteps not far behind He turns a corner and hears footsteps coming
from the other direction He tries a door Its locked He tries another it opens

INT SURGEONS ROOM IN CASTLE - NIGHT
He listens with relief as the footsteps pass the door

He turns to see Cassio being tended by SURGEONS Roderigo is propped up on a table and
Lodovico searches his pockets They havent seen lago He catches his breath

INT BEDROOM - NIGHT
Emilia lies by Desdemona

EMILIA
What did thy song bode lady
Hark canst thou hear me I will play the swan
And die in music
(sings)
Willow willow willow
Moor she was chaste she loved thee cruel
moor So come my soul to bliss as I speak true
So speaking as I think I die I die

INT SURGEONS ROOM IN CASTLE — NIGHT

Jago remains unseen at the door Roderigos eyes slowly open They open wider Band slowly raises
his arm and points Lodovico follows the direction and sees lago

Jago turns to open the door and comes face to face with Montano and SOLDIERS He turns back
with a wry smile Roderigo smiles back at him shuts his eyes and slumps in the Surgeons arms

Jago slips out his dagger but is knocked to the ground before he can use it Feet fly at his body

INT BEDROOM - NIGHT
Othello is on the bed poring over Desdemonas body

OTHELLO
Now how dost thou look now O ill-starred wench
Pale an thy smock Cold cold my girl
Even like thy chastity
O cursed cursed slave Whip me ye devils
From the possession of this heavenly sight
Blow me about in winds Roast me in sulphur
Wash me in steep-down gulfs of liquid fire O Desdemona
Dead O O

Lodovico arrives with Cassio on crutches and soldiers

LODOVICO
Where is this rash and most unfortunate man

OTHELLO
Thats he that was Othello Here I am

LODOVICO
Where is that viper Bring the villain forth

Montano brings Iago in He is tied hand and foot and his face is badly beaten and bruised
OTHELLO

I look down towards his feet but thats a fable If that thou
best a devil I cannot kill thee

He draws one of the soldiers swords and thrusts it into Iagos side Iago falls to the ground
clutching the sword Montano pushes Othello away and wrenches out the sword Iago crumples

but clings to Othello

IAGO
I bleed sir but not killed

Jago is pulled off and thrown to the ground

OTHELLO
Iam not sorry neither Id have thee live
For in my sense tis happiness to die

LODOVICO
his wretch hath part confessed his villainy
Did you and he consent in Cassios death

OTHELLO
Ay

CASSIO
Dear general I never gave you cause

OTHELLO
I do believe it and ask you pardon
Will you I pray demand that demi-devil
Why he hath thus ensnared my soul and body

IAGO
Demand me nothing what you know you know
From this time forth I never will speak word

He looks once into the Camera and turns away

LODOVICO
What Not to pray

GRATIANO
Torments will ope your lips

OTHELLO
Well thou dost best

Gratiano spins round and spits in Othellos face
Othello sees there is a growing menace in the soldiers faces
LODOVICO
You must forsake this room and go with us
Your power and your command is taken off

And Cassio rules in Cyprus

Cassio extends his hand to Othello They clasp hands Othello realizes that Cassio is trying to pass
something to him

He glimpses the small ruby-studded dagger that he gave Cassio when he made him lieutenant He
takes it and conceals it

LODOVICO
Come bring him away

Soldiers take hold of him He grabs a bed-post

OTHELLO
Soft you a word or two before you go

The soldiers pull aggressively but he wont let go
OTHELLO
I have done the state some service and they know it

Lodovico motions to the Soldiers to release him

OTHELLO
I pray you in your letters
When you shall these unlucky deeds relate
Speak of me as I am nothing extenuate
Nor set down aught in malice Then must you speak
Of one that loved not wisely but too well
Of one not easily jealous but being wrought
Perplexed in the extreme of one whose hand
Like the base Indian threw a pearl away
Richer than all his tribe of one whose subdued eyes
Albeit unused to the melting mood
Drops tears as fast as the Arabian trees
Their medicinable gum Set you down this
And say besides that in Aleppo once
Where a malignant and a turbaned Turk
Beat a Venetian and traduced the state
I took by the throat the circumcised dog
And smote him thus

He pulls out the dagger and drives it into his heart
Jago gasps and falls to his knees Cassio prevents the others intervening
Othello climbs onto the bed and over to Desdemona

OTHELLO
I kissed thee ere I killed thee No way but this
Killing myself to die upon a kiss

With his lips pressed to here he dies

CASSIO
This did I fear but thought he had no weapon
For he was great of heart

Lodovico drags lago over to the foot of the bed

LODOVICO

Look on the tragic loading of this bed
This is thy work

(to Cassio)
To you lord governor
Remains the censure of this hellish villain
The time the place the torture O enforce it
Myself will straight aboard and to the state
This heavy act with heavy heart relate

He leaves the room All follow except Cassio and Iago

Cassio goes to the window opens the shutters and looks out to sea The weak light of pre-dawn
brings a little light into the room A bird sings
Iago has worked his way onto the bed He pushes Emilia aside and worms his way between the
two lovers Othellos body rolls back revealing a large patch of spreading redness on the sheets

Dawn breaks More light spills into the room colour with it The blood shines scarlet red

Jago lays his head on Othellos thigh and stares into the Camera

EXT SEA - DAY

The sun rises over the sea

INT DUNGEON - DAY
Darkness except for glints of metal and silence but for a soft creaking sound

lagos eyes In the shadows we glimpse instruments of torture clamped to his limbs His face
remains impassive

EXT SEA - DAY
Cassio in generals uniform stands on the prow of a boat

A linen wrapped package is tipped into the water by two attendants

EXT UNDERWATER - DAY

Beneath the surface The sun glares through the water We see the entwined figures of Othello and
Desdemona sinking towards us past us and into the darkness

EXT SEA - DAY

Rose petals float on the water

CREDITS

FADE OUT

THE END
