INT DIMLY-LIT BAR - NIGHT

A suburban-looking HUSBAND and WIFE enter They find
Rainbow Randolph sitting alone drinking a Scotch Hair
slicked back sans bow tie the friendly face no longer
looks so friendly He nods for them to sit down After
a nervous beat the Husband puts a briefcase on the table
and slides it to Randolph Randolph takes a gulp of his
Scotch He unsnaps the briefcase and opens it Five
grand stares him in the face

HUSBAND
So uh youll make sure my
boy dances up front right Where
hell get the most camera time
Randolph slams the briefcase shut startling the couple

RANDOLPH
You want your kid on the show

HUSBAND
Of of course

WIFE
Yes very much

RANDOLPH
Then dont tell me how to run my
fucking business

HUSBAND
No no we were just --

Randolph rises He takes a final gulp of his Scotch and
picks up the briefcase

RANDOLPH
Ill call you if a spot opens up

He starts to walk off Suddenly the Husband and Wife
jump up from the table holding guns

HUSBAND
Freeze you cocksucker

WIFE
Drop the briefcase

Federal agents storm into the bar and surround Randolph

EXT TIMES SQUARE - DAWN

Bundles of the morning editions are tossed onto the curb

The Rainbow RandolphKrinkle Kid set is being dismantled
Backdrops are rolled up and the giant rainbow centerpiece
is wheeled off Workers with push brooms sweep up tons

of glittery magic Rainbow dust

INT NETWORK BOARDROOM - KIDNET - DAY

We are TIGHT ON the sweating face of a MAN who looks like
hes about to be executed

CUT BACK TO

STOKES

is standing at the end of a long conference table as the
NETWORK BRASS glares at him

STOKES
(addressing the brass)
Gentlemen let me be the first to
say in all sobriety that Im as
shocked and outraged as all of --

The network CEO a hog of a man cuts him off

CEO
Save it for the papers Stokes
Weve got nervous sponsors and an
angry public -- a combination
uglier than two monkeys fucking
What are you doing about it

STOKES
Well sir Im currently in the
process of compiling a list of
viable replacements and its my
hope

CEO
Clean replacements With
background checks I assure you
Mr Stokes this network cannot
survive another Rainbow Randolph
The goddamn PR department looks
like the Jim Jones camp
Another EXECUTIVE chimes in

EXECUTIVE 1
Remember Stokes this was your
dog that crapped on our rug

EXECUTIVE 2
We trusted you Frank And now
were in a tight spot We have to
post our quarterly earnings next
month for Christs sake

CEO
Whoever takes that slot has to be
a straight arrow Clean as a
whistle

EXECUTIVE 3
Right Someone wholl take the
heat off One of those sweater
types Any chance of luring Fred
Rogers away from PBS

EXECUTIVE 4
Yeah if we back up the Brinks
truck

EXECUTIVE 1
No way The idea now is to stop
the hemorrhaging

EXECUTIVE 2
You better fix this Stokes Get
us a white bread replacement
fast Bland milk toast Not a
speck of controversy

A giant hand slams on the table All heads snap
The CEO drags his fingers along the shiny mahogany
Deafening sound

CEO
(calm and measured)
Squeaky fucking clean

INT STOKES OFFICE - DAY

Stokes sits behind his mahogany desk sipping a glass of
wine as he goes over potential Randolph replacements with
NORA BISHOP his pretty protege
STOKES

Bumble Bee Billy

NORA
(reading from a list)

Wife beater

STOKES

Square Dance Danny

NORA
Still appealing the mail fraud
thing
STOKES
Skippy Black and the Tippy Trolls
NORA
Black was deported and the
trolls well who gives a shit

Nora kicks the table in frustration

Stokes flips
stops at one

Nora laughs

NORA

This is impossible If I ever see
that Rainbow Randolph again Ill

s
fe)

trangle him Choke the life out
f him Squeeze his scrawny neck

until his eyes pop out of his

s

kull and bounce off the walls

STOKES

Before indulging such cheery
fantasies lets just concentrate
on saving my job Shall we

NORA

Sorry Frank

t

hrough a thick stack of files

STOKES
hats going on with Sheldon Mopes
hese days

NORA
h my God Have we sunk to that

He suddenly
level already Smoochy the Rhino
What a sap

STOKES
Saps just the pill we need right
now Mopes is a straight arrow
Always has been

NORA
The guy cant get arrested Frank
He cant even break into the
birthday party circuit Last I
heard he was working hospitals and
nursing homes Hes a joke

Stokes stands up and walks around the room

STOKES
The truth of the matter is a
successful childrens show has
always depended on two simple
elements a fuzzy costume anda
lot of hype Strip away the foam
rubber and the network money and
theyre all jokes Marginal
talents cabaret acts off-
Broadway runoff

NORA
I probably have ten acts in my
development file -- acts Ive been
cultivating -- that are more
deserving than Sheldon Mopes

STOKES
And each one a moral question
mark Something I cant risk at
the moment

NORA
(frustrated)
We can do better than this guy
Frank He brings nothing to the
table

STOKES
Except ethics With Mopes
theres never been a whiff of
controversy The mans an
ethical harmless cornball In
short a glass of milk on two
legs
Stokes stops pacing

NORA
Dont ask me to do it You know
Ill do anything for you but
please not this

Stokes gazes out the window at the city

STOKES
Go find Smoochy

EXT CONEY ISLAND - EARLY EVENING

The lighted Ferris wheel spins CENTER FRAME We CRANE
DOWN and eventually LAND ON a side street with the
amusement park looming in the bg Were in FRONT of a
small building The half-lit neon sign reads CONEY
ISLAND METHADONE CENTER We DRIFT THROUGH the double
doors THROUGH the reception area where random junkies
loiter and fill out paperwork We CONTINUE DOWN a
narrow hallway as the faint sound of someone SINGING and
playing the GUITAR INCREASES We finally burst THROUGH
another set of doors marked Treatment Room The
singing now fills our ears as we PUSH IN ON the
performer -- a big puffy orange rhinoceros Smoochy
Or to be more specific SHELDON MOPES

Smoochy sits on a stool with his guitar and sings to the
patients as they stand in line before a sliding glass
window where a nurse hands each person a little cup of
methadone which they immediately drink

The Smoochy costume is a mass of misshapen orange foam
rubber that exposes Sheldons painted face in the front
A multi-colored horn protrudes from his forehead

SMOOCHY (SHELDON)
(singing to the tune
of Shell be Comin
round the Mountain)
‘Well get that monkey off your
back
Yes we will yes we will
Well get that monkey off your
back
Yes we will
‘Well get that monkey off your
back

And get your life right back on
track

If youll just give up the smack

Yes you will yes you will

The song ends A few baffled junkies applaud
SMOOCHY
Thanks fellas Im rooting for
you
We PAN AWAY FROM Sheldon TO the exit Standing there in

her coat looking mortified is Nora

INT RECEPTION AREA - SHORT WHILE LATER

Nora sits in the reception area Sheldon emerges in his
street clothes He carries Smoochys body on a hanger
over his shoulder and carries a large shopping bag which
holds Smoochys head

NORA
Mr Mopes

Sheldon stops

SHELDON
Yeah

NORA
I uh saw your performance
tonight Very
(searching)
Spirited

SHELDON
Really Thanks I wouldve done
a longer set if that guy hadnt
pulled a knife on the security
guard Once the pepper spray
starts flyin thats it for the
encores

NORA
Yes that did put a damper on the
evening didnt it

SHELDON
Are you a new patient On the
juice as we say

NORA
Ah no But its sweet of you to
assume so

She hands him her card He reads it

SHELDON
Nora Bishop VP of
Development Kidnet
(to Nora)

NORA
As stated

Sheldon grabs her hand and shakes it

SHELDON
Well its a pleasure to meet you
Nora A real honor Hey you
hungry

EXT CONEY ISLAND BOARDWALK - NATHANS HOT DOGS - SHORT
WHILE LATER

Sheldon and Nora stand at the crowded counter at
Nathans Sheldon ravenously eats his sloppily-
garnished oddly colored hot dog Nora winces as
she watches him

SHELDON

(with full mouth)
Soy dogs never thought Id
live to see the day Organic
rich in natural protein and
nobody gets killed Although I
do feel bad for the beans Just
idding Sure you dont want one

NORA
Believe it or not no

He takes another bite

SHELDON
So anyway like I was saying

He pulls the
shopping bag

network Sheldon you gotta sell
yourself or youll be playing
the drug clinics and shopping
centers the rest of your life
And you know what I tell ‘em

NORA

SHELDON
I tell ‘em its not about the old
handshake and back slap game

shlock machine Its about doing
good work Having integrity
Making people happy and delivering
a positive message Foundations
are built with concrete not
plaster of Paris

stained misshapen Smoochy head from the

SHELDON
This is concrete This is
integrity

NORA
(calmly)
I can see that

Sheldon realizes his voice was getting too loud

SHELDON
Sorry As you can imagine living
by your convictions can be a
little stressful at times

NORA
We all have our cross to bear

SHELDON
See I was raised by my
grandfather and Grandpop paved
driveways for a living

NORA
Are we going into a story

SHELDON
Thing is he didnt really pave

them Just covered them with

black paint Of course once the
first rain came along people
realized theyd been swindled I
vowed to myself back then that Id
never make a living through
deception Never Whadda ya

think of them apples

Nora looks glassy-eyed She takes a deep breath

NORA
The reason Im here today Mr
Mopes as fate would have it
Kidnet is currently looking for a
performer with convictions
And integrity Someone like

She almost chokes on the word

NORA
- yourself

Sheldon laughs

SHELDON
Yeah right Got any more jokes

NORA
I dont think I could top that
one

SHELDON

Hold the phone Youre telling me
that Kidnet is finally ready to do
a show of Smoochy quality Of
Smoochy caliber

NORA
(dryly)
Yes I believe were ready to
push ourselves to that level

SHELDON

After all these years I finally
meet someone in the business who

all about You get me dont you

END of prep MONTAGE

EXT DOCK BY RIVER - NIGHT (POURING RAIN)

A disheveled Randolph paces on a deserted dock The
Brooklyn Bridge looms in the bg A car pulls up in the
bg Stokes gets out Randolph moves under an awning

RANDOLPH
I was starting to think that maybe
you werent coming

STOKES
I agreed to meet you didnt I I
had a dinner engagement

Randolph takes a swig from a flask

RANDOLPH
Really You know I used to have
dinner engagements Sometimes
four five a night Dinner
drinks I was the toast of the
fucking town

STOKES
Dont start Randolph Please

RANDOLPH

(voice rising)
Cars boats whores and horses I
had em all When I walked into a
restaurant ten guys reached for
my hat When I stood up to take a
piss they cleared the rest room
Id walk down the street and
traffic stopped mouths gaped
You know why You know why
Frank

(now shouting)
I was Rainbow fucking Randolph
Thats why

STOKES
Are you through

RANDOLPH
What Youre in a hurry You
dont have time for me The guy
who earned for you The guy who
put those fucking suits on your
back and the pheasant au vin in
your Brooklyn mouth

STOKES
I think its fair to say we helped
each other

Randolph suddenly breaks down

RANDOLPH
(pleading)
You gotta fix it Frank You
gotta get me my slot back

He now clings to Stokes lapels

RANDOLPH
How can I sit around while that
rhinoceros that horned
carpetbagger gets a free ride on
my dime You and I have history
Frank Please

Stokes pries Randolphs hands from his overcoat
STOKES
Theres nothing I can do for you
Nothing Youre a pariah I

cant even be seen with you

RANDOLPH
Dont do this to me Frank Im in
deep deep shit They kicked me out
of the corporate penthouse I got
bookies breathing down my neck

Im homeless Dont you hear what
Im saying Im not gonna make it
The clocks ticking Put yourself
in my shoes for Christs sake

STOKES
The ugly truth is your shoes have
become my shoes As long as the
rhinos on the air everythings
by the book No skim no
percentage Nothing The network
wanted squeaky clean and they got
it And believe me Mopes is
sparkling

He looks Randolph squarely in the eye

STOKES
Youre totally broke You dont
have a dime left to your name

RANDOLPH
Yes Exactly Thats what Im
trying to tell you

Randolph looks at him hopefully as Stokes straightens his
tie

STOKE
Dont contact me again Randy
Ever
Stokes walks off Randolph watches him disappear through

the mist

RANDOLPH
Youll get yours Frank The rhino
too Do you hear me The wheels
are turning

Stokes is gone Randolph takes a swig from his flask and
wipes his chin with his sleeve He stares out at the
river

RANDOLPH

(quietly to

himself)
Sooner or later even a guy whos
squeaky clean falls into mud

SMOOCHY THE RHINO - DAY

as it erratically limps forward before DROPPING OUT OF
FRAME

WIDER

The wind-up Smoochy lays upside-down on the carpet next
to Noras desk legs grinding lamely in the air Various
Smoochy items are spread out on her desk top A
restless-looking Sheldon and a few members of Noras
staff are in on the meeting

NORA
Again these are just prototypes
Ive been assured by FunZone that
all the bugs will be worked out
before Christmas

Sheldon raises his hand Nora ignores him and looks at
her watch

NORA
Okay so lets recap before we
break up
(refers to notes)
es to the Smoochy ice pops No to
e Smoochy string cheese And
ere in a dick-measuring contest
ith Brown and Brown over the
ampoo split

OfeateK

Sheldon suddenly stands up

SHELDON

Okay time out people If I may
interject I think were putting
the cart before the horse here

Nora throws him an icy look

SHELDON
Smoochys still earning the trust
of the kids We dont want to
compromise that by asking them to
buy shampoo and cheese How bout we
just concentrate on doing the best
show possible Huh Without all
the bells and whistles and
vrickata-rackita What do you say
guys
Nora casually picks up a Smoochy Frisbee from her desk
and sails it toward the open door It lands in the
hallway
NORA
(monotone)

Oh damn

SHELDON
No problem Ill get it

He walks out to the hallway
NORA
(to staffer)
Shut the door please John
John shuts the door

NORA
Now lock it

He locks it
NORA
Thank you
EXT KIDNET BUILDING - NIGHT
Nora emerges from the revolving door of the Kidnet
building which is located in the heart of Times Square
and heads down Broadway Sheldon emerges from the

building

SHELDON
Hey Nora wait up

She keeps walking Sheldon catches up and walks
alongside her occasionally getting jostled by passersby

SHELDON
Good meeting today I thought we
tackled some hot issues
Although Ill be honest there
were a few times that I felt my
voice wasnt being heard

NORA
I think thats a conservative
estimate

SHELDON
I just want the show to have some
weight you know Some substance
Silly songs sure -- but with a
message Pop quiz How many
original compositions are in the
Smoochy songbook

NORA
Do you sense my complete lack of
interest

SHELDON
Try two thousand Covering every
topic from how yummy vegetables
are to the importance of donating
plasma Dont you get it Nora
Im a valuable resource Use me

Nora stops She looks Sheldon in the eye for the first

time

NORA
Can I make this real easy for you

SHELDON
Sure

NORA
The only reason youre on TV right
now is because Rainbow Randolph is
a degenerate scumbag I didnt
discover you I delivered you
Like a bag of groceries I have a
bigger emotional investment in my
nail polish So dont peddle your
sap to me rhino Your job is
just to smile and nod your head

She walks off

INT PATSYS - NIGHT

Sheldon sits at the bar in the restaurant nursing a
drink and talking to the BARTENDER He seems slightly
drunk

SHELDON
No no you misunderstand me
Its not that Im literally
comparing Captain Kangaroo to
Jesus Christ Im just saying
that the Captain like Christ was
someone you could believe in
Those guys didnt care about bells
and whistles and rickita-rackata
It was all about the work
Especially Jesus Forget about
it

The Bartender nods and starts to pour Sheldon another
drink

SHELDON
(waving him off)
Thats okay my good man Threes
my limit

BARTENDER
I never saw anyone get loaded on
orange juice before

SHELDON
Back in my college days I could
put away a carton of the stuff

A sharply-dressed man BURKE BENNETT sits down next to
Sheldon

BURKE
(to Bartender)
Gimme a Five Crown

The Bartender nods He looks over at Sheldon
BURKE
Smoochy the Rhino Wow Ima
big fan
SHELDON
(flattered)

Gee thanks I usually dont get
recognized without my horn

Burke extends his hand

BURKE
Burke Bennett I represent kid
show talent

INT PATSYS - SHORT WHILE LATER
Sheldon and Burke now sit at a corner table

BURKE
Look Shel Frank Strokes aint in
the business to make you rich
Hes in it to make Frank Stokes
rich Thats how these network
goons operate

SHELDON
Thats so sad Is it just me or
is that sad

BURKE
You know years ago a client of
mine Dicky Gimble was having a
problem

SHELDON
Wow you represented Dicky Gimble

BURKE

Yeah before the asshole found
religion Anyway Stokes was
trying to screw my boy out of some
merchandising points Claimed he
had a warehouse full of Dicky
dolls that werent moving Now
Frank and I are old friends so I
say to him Okay cock show me
the warehouse -- see I know the
fucking warehouse is in the Bronx
and I know its emptier than my
wifes head

(chuckles)
To make a long story short I walk
out with a check for a hundred
grand and Stokes is sitting there
with his thumb up his ass

Burke laughs

SHELDON
Thats very amusing but I dont
care about Smoochy dolls and
Smoochy floor wax I just want
more creative input This rhino
came from my womb I bore him I
nursed him and dammit

He pounds his fist on the table

SHELDON
I should be the one who raises
him
BURKE

Shel its all about the dough
After you get the money you get
the power And after you get the
power you can have Smoochy walk
on stage with a hard-on if you

want

SHELDON
Its funny that never crossed my
mind

Burke downs the rest of his drink and stands up

BURKE
Unfortunately until then
youre just another puppet in the
prop room

He hands Sheldon his card

BURKE
Give me a call when youre ready
kid Ill cut the strings and
open the magic door for you

EXT PATSYS - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Randolph peers through the restaurants front window He
shivers from the cold as he watches Sheldon and Burke
shake hands Burke heads for the exit Randolph quickly
ducks into the shadows A moment later Burke exits the
club and walks down the street Randolph pops out

RANDOLPH
I saw you I saw you in there
at my table talking to him

BURKE
Yeah so what do you want A
parade

RANDOLPH
Youre my agent Or did you
forget that

BURKE
Not anymore pal Youre a
cigarette butt Go lay in the
gutter

Burke walks off

EXT ALLEY - NIGHT

In the litter-strewn alley we PAN ACROSS several grocery
bags broken egg shells flour bags butter wrappers
mixing bowls and other baking ingredients The PAN ENDS
ON Randolph who stands over a barrel fire holding a
spatula A cookie sheet rests on the barrel Randolph
removes the cookie sheet and gazes at it gleefully We
now see that the cookies are phallic-shaped

RANDOLPH
Ah Theyre beautiful A perfect
batch of cock cookies for a very
special rhino

He sets the tray aside

RANDOLPH
Oh yes youre going to learn
about shame my dear Smoochy And

Im your professor

He laughs

INT KIDNET STUDIO - STAGE B - DAY

Its thirty minutes before a Smoochy taping Dozens of
giddy children are led into the studio where they take
seats on the bleachers

BACKSTAGE

Sheldon in the Smoochy costume sans head lumbers up to
Nora He holds a rundown for that days show

SHELDON
Excuse me Nora Why was the
Please and Thank You Song cut

NORA
Because its sappy and it takes
away from the Cookie Song

SHELDON

Takes away It enhances it

The

cookie song is a meaningless piece
of fluff without the Please and
Thank You coda Thats the moral

anchor Thats where the lesson

is You cant sell the sizzle

without the steak

NORA
Its cut And I want the

Cookie

Song lyrics changed back to the
way they were originally scripted

SHELDON

I cant do that I will not
condone children consuming endless
I have

to look myself in the mirror every

amounts of refined sugar

morning

NORA

This is network television
sprout farm Were here to sell
sugar and plastic Thats what

keeps the lights on

SHELDON

not a

Youre treating me like a puppet

You know that Well guess

what I am not your puppet

NORA

Since when Now get your spongy

orange ass out there and dance

for the cameras

An angry Sheldon storms off in frustration

stops He looks back at her

SHELDON

We have different eyes Nora

When I go out there I see kids

You see wallets with pigtails

but then

He moves on Nora stares at him as he walks away He
obviously got to her As Sheldon heads toward the
studio he doesnt notice the two beady eyes staring
at him from under the stairwell After a beat

Randolph emerges and slinks backstage

Hes

clutching a duffle bag

INT PROP ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Randolph sneaks into the prop room and shuts the door
He scurries over to the prop shelf and locates Smoochys
multicolored magic cookie bag He opens it and tosses
the cookies into the trash can Reaching into his
pockets he pulls out his special homemade cookies He
chuckles as he dumps them into the magic cookie bag

RANDOLPH
Bon soir la Smoochy Welcome to
fatty Arbuckle-land

He cackles to himself He then notices a box in the
corner of the room Scribbled in magic marker on the
side are the words Rainbow Randolph crap He walks
over and pulls the box out He slowly opens the flaps
Inside is his old costume He pulls it out and clutches
it lovingly He smells it The ECHOEY SOUND of his
THEME SONG comes flooding back to him for a moment
along with the sound of CHILDREN LAUGHING

RANDOLPH
(softly to himself)
Dont worry little ones Rainbow
Randolph will return
(with rising anger)
After these messages

He holds up Smoochys magic cookie bag He then stuffs
his old costume into his duffle bag

INT STUDIO B - LATER

The Smoochy Show is in the middle of a taping The
Smoochyland Band is playing a fast jazzy number (Doin
the Jiggy Ziggy) as Smoochy the Rhinettes and several
kids dance frenetically The kids in the bleachers are
in hysterics as Smoochy shakes his body spastically The
song finally ends The kids in the bleachers jump to
their feet cheering and applauding

SMOOCHY
Boy all that jiggyin and
ziggyin sure makes a fella
hungry Now if only I had my
super duper super secret super
special

The kids in the bleachers erupt in unison

KIDS
Magic Cookie Bag

SMOOCHY
Right-o-riffic
(looks skyward)
Magic Cookie Bag I command thee
Come to your lord and master

The lights dim as the Smoochyland Band plays the 2001
theme Smoochys Magic Cookie Bag is lowered from the
ceiling by a filament wire The kids go crazy

SMOOCHY
(singing)

Lookie lookie lookie here
comes the cookies Fresh and
organic no need to panic Right
from the soil no tropical oils
Sweetened with juice for an
energy boost Fiber galore
youll be askin for more

ANGLE ON NORA

She looks pissed but then looks over at the kids in the
bleachers Their faces are filled with laughter For

the first time she feels the connection Smoochy has with
them

ANGLE ON RANDOLPH

He peers out from his hiding place backstage His eyes
widen with delight as the Magic Cookie Bag continues its
descent

ANGLE ON SMOOCHY

The cookie bag finally reaches Smoochy He holds the bag
high above his head in a religious ceremonial fashion as
the Rhinettes and the kids crowd around him

SMOOCHY
Oooh just the smell of
unprocessed flour makes my tummy
do somersaults

RANDOLPH
(under his breath)

SMOOCHY

His puffy orange hand reaches for the bags clasp as the
MUSIC reaches its CRESCENDO

RANDOLPH

Hes practically shaking as he suppresses an insane
laugh

RANDOLPH

Give em a cookie give em a

SMOOCHY

He reaches into the bag and with a grand flourish pulls
out a flaming red penis cookie The cookie is somewhat
misshapen and not perfectly formed Smoochy gets a big
grin

SMOOCHY
Wow Look at this cookie kids
A rocket ship

The kids ooh and ahh

ANGLE ON RANDOLPH
He looks confused
SHELDON
What a special day with such
special cookies

BACK ON SMOOCHY

Smoochy pretends to zoom the penis cookie through the
air

SHELDON

Randolph whose face is now bright red cant take it
anymore He runs onto the stage He grabs the rocket
cookie from Smoochy

RANDOLPH

chair near Stokes

SHELDON
Thank you all for coming I just

communication department No
finger-pointing Lord knows when
you start pointing fingers
someone gets poked in the eye

Sheldon laughs Stokes and Nora sit stone-faced

SHELDON
Anyhoo Id like to turn the floor
over to my new agent Mr Burke
Bennett So heeeeeeres Burke
Sheldon applauds Burke stands

BURKE
As you can imagine my client has
many concerns not the least of
which is studio security but we
can address that later

He pats Sheldons head like a dog

BURKE

See this guy Frank Take a good
long look cause this prick saved
your life Without him youd be
sitting in Kaplans right now
sucking club soda through a paper
straw

(to Nora)
And you -- youd be organizing
puppet shows for the brats at
PS 86 Excuse me honey

NORA
Theres no excuse for you

SHELDON
Man I love club soda

Sheldon laughs trying to lighten the mood Burke gives
him an affectionate slap

STOKES
Weve always managed to come to
some sort of arrangement Burke
Why the fireworks

BURKE
Cause Im holding all the
gunpowder I represent the man
who created owns and controls
every square inch of Smoochy the
Rhino

Burke pours himself a drink from Stokes private bar

BURKE
God created Adam and what did he
get A fucking dud My guy He
breathed life into a winner And
anyone who does a better job than
God is gonna have a price

SHELDON
Burke of course is in no way
comparing me to God

BURKE
Yes I am

NORA
You seem to forget that we went
out and found your guy Dug up
his corpse Handed him his own
show when he couldnt sell his
face to a photo booth

SHELDON
To be fair Nora I was booked to
open a car wash in Montauk

BURKE

Oh so you were doing him a favor

(chuckles)
Allow me to untangle this web of
shit I dont care what his
resume was I dont care where you
found him I dont care if his
last job was juggling apples for a
hut full of Pygmies on the
outskirts of the Congo the fact
is he fits a bill and you need
him Like a hungry baby needs a
big tit And that my friends is
why youre in a box with no
ventilation And that is why the
rhino is going to get what
he deserves

STOKES
What is that exactly

Burke walks over to Stokes desk and leans across it
Hes an inch from Stokes face

creative control part ownership
of the show discretion over
merchandising and a dressing room
with a toilet Am I dreaming or

dollar bills just to see

respect for money Not to mention
Ben Franklin who had some
remarkable achievements in his
lifetime

Burke pulls out a paper bag and hands it to Sheldon

SHELDON
Whats this

Burke

BURKE
Thats your graduation present
Something youre gonna need now

Sheldon reaches in the bag and pulls out a revolver He
recoils in horror and immediately drops it back in the
bag

BURKE
Think of it as a tool of the
trade
SHELDON

Ive never owned a gun Ive never
touched a gun and I dont believe
in guns When I played cowboys

and Indians as a kid I was always
the Chinese railroad worker

BURKE
Trust me Shel Its a handy
accessory in this business Even
if you dont load it have it for
show Sometimes thats all you
need Especially with a creep
like Randolph lurking around

Burke and Sheldon look up and notice the hulking
grinning figure of SPINNER DUNN standing over them
Spinner has the smile of a little boy despite his
crooked nose and scarred face He extends his hand

Tonight marks Spinner Dunns final
appearance in the ring What a
pleasure its been to watch him
proudly march into the record books
for taking more blows to the head

A bloodied defeated Spinner happily holds up the arm of
his opponent after a match He then hugs the referee
He jumps down from the ring and hugs the three judges

RINGSIDE COMMENTATOR 2

A powerful-looking woman TOMMY COTTER calls to Spinner
from the bar

TOMMY
Spinner come over and meet the
Senator

Spinner dutifully hurries over to Tommy

SHELDON
He seems pretty popular It must
take real talent to run a place
like this

BURKE
Spinner The guy couldnt run a
water faucet Hes just a mascot
Its his cousins a bunch of Irish
mob boys who really run the
joint

ANGLE ON SPINNER

He shakes the Senators hand as Tommy and a few other
tough Irish guys stand around Spinner looks over
towards Sheldon

apartment A Rhinette costume is draped over one of

the chairs There is a sudden LOUD POUNDING on the door
Angelo puts the spoon down and reaches behind some spices
on the shelf above He pulls out a revolver The

POUNDING continues

ANGELO

Randolph sits on top of the little man

RANDOLPH

on the floor

RANDOLPH

He cackles insanely as he picks up a bottle of gin and
takes a deep swig He passes out and falls off the
chair Angelo leans down and lifts his head off the
floor

ANGELO
Stop doing this to yourself

Randolph doesnt respond Angelo slaps his face

ANGELO

SHELDON

TOMMY
You know a little part on the
show Youre the executive
producer now You call the shots
right

SHELDON

TOMMY
This makes me sad Very very
sad

DANNY
Whats wrong Tommy

a conversation

SHELDON
Burke I never agreed to do an ice

BURKE

Shel do you know what kind of
cash well take in between the
gate and concessions A venture
like this gets you money and
muscle Times twenty

SHELDON
Ice shows represent everything Im
against Theyre mindless
spectacles whose main purpose is
to sell overpriced sugar-water and
cheap plastic toys that splinter
in a kids mouth on the ride home

BURKE
Look I know you got this fetish
for ethics but nows not the time
to fly that kite No ones ever
refused a shot at an ice show

Sheldon tears the contract in half

SHELDON
Until now Smoochy doesnt sell
out Burke You should be proud
of that Proud that you represent

paints them over

pleasure to meet you

SHELDON

Sheldon laughs nervously

MERV

Hope Foundation Maybe youve
heard of us

SHELDON
You raise money to build
childrens hospitals right
MERV
Weve been known to add a brick or
two sure

Merv and the thug laugh

MERV
Sheldon let me get right to the
point -- theres talk on the

street that youre pulling out of
the ice show Is that true

SHELDON

(big sigh)
You know I never agreed to an
ice show nor would I ever agree
to do an ice show and let me add
that none of this is your concern
sir

(shakes his head)

Shees

MERV

Listen carefully son Parade of
Hope has sponsored every Kidnet
ice show since 1964 We take a
piece off the top and everybody
walks away happy So lets not
buck history

SHELDON

Well I appreciate the offer but

for the gazillionth time Im not

A troubled-looking Sheldon stands on his balcony looking
out at the city He drinks orange juice straight from

Sheldon is on the phone with Burke

SHELDON
This is unacceptable Burke Im
calling the authorities

BURKE (VO)
Dont do it Shel You rat on
Parade of Hope and youll be lucky

organization thats supposed to
help children What kind of world
is this

BURKE (VO)

Consider the ice show and stay
healthy

Burke hangs up After a beat Sheldons DOORBELL RINGS
He walks over to the door and opens it To his surprise
Nora is standing there

NORA

SHELDON

Nora enters She seems a little wobbly Sheldon notices
shes holding a pint of whiskey

SHELDON
Uh are you okay

NORA
Im getting drunk and Im not used
to it

SHELDON

Oh Well not to make you feel
worse but with alcohol youre
also consuming empty calories

Nora looks at him for a moment

NORA
Its just that I want to
apologize actually And on those
rare occasions when I feel the
need to apologize for something
it helps if Im you know shit-
faced
SHELDON
Wow Im honored
Nora trips slightly Sheldon takes the whiskey from her
SHELDON

He leads her

Why dont we get some air

harsh when we spoke the other day
A little out of line

faced no-talent hack

NORA
Yes that was probably insensitive
as well
(looks at him)
I heard youre not doing the ice

show I find that incredibly
admirable Why didnt you tell
me

SHELDON

I guess I didnt want to spoil
your fun You look so content
when youre berating me
Nora looks down

NORA
Im afraid I have become a bit
hardened over the years
Sinceritys an easy disguise in
this business Its hard to know
whos on the level

SHELDON
Believe me Im learning that more
and more every day
(wistfully)
Sometimes light is really dark
Sometimes crows can sing like
larks
Sometimes Winter feels like
Spring
Dont think you know everything

NORA
(in disbelief)
Rickets the Hippo

SHELDON
You remember Rickets

NORA
That was my favorite show when I
was a kid Rickets was the one
face I knew I could trust

SHELDON
Thats how I felt Rickets had
real depth He was my inspiration
for Smoochy

NORA
Really He was my inspiration to
work in childrens television

SHELDON
I cant believe it I never met
anyone who even remembers Rickets
Do you remember the Klunky-Wunky
dance

NORA
Remember it I did it at my first
communion
Sheldon starts doing the rather insane-looking Klunky-
Wunky dance Nora does it with him They both stop and
look at each other Sheldon impulsively leans in and
kisses her

SHELDON
Im sorry That was a mistake
right I didnt mean for that to
hap--

Nora grabs his head and pulls it toward her They begin
kissing passionately

NORA
(as they kiss)
Youre not full of shit like all
the others are you
SHELDON
No no
NORA
(as they kiss)
Youre for real right
SHELDON
Yes yes
NORA
(through the kisses)
I mean I couldnt tell First I
thought it was an act and then
I just thought you were a simp or
something
SHELDON
Shhh you dont have to
explain
They continue to kiss Nora abruptly stops
NORA

I should go

SHELDON
Why

Nora exits the balcony and collects her coat and purse

SHELDON
Whats wrong Is it the whiskey
If you have to throw up be my
guest Anywhere you like

NORA
Its just getting late

Sheldon follows her to the door She stops and looks at
him for a moment The PHONE starts to RING Neither of
them says anything for a beat

She exits Sheldon shuts the door and sighs He goes to
the bar to pour himself another orange juice before
picking up the phone

Smoochy addresses them

SMOOCHY
(singing)
So three cheers for the man
that I proudly call Stan Hes

Yes he gets cross but still hes
the boss And besides he takes
care of my mother

SMOOCHY

a new puppy new dads need to
adjust to their surroundings So
give em time But always
remember if he becomes abusive
to you or Mommy what are the
magic numbers

scratches his crotch

favorite rhino ladies and
gentlemen boys and girls
(dramatic pause)
Heeeeeres Smoochy

Smoochy skates out to thunderous applause The entire
arena is on its feet The Rhinettes part as Smoochy
skates through them and stops in the middle of the rink
The applause and cheering dont stop for several moments
One of the Rhinettes hands Smoochy a microphone

SMOOCHY
On behalf of myself the
Rhinettes and the soon to be
restored Coney Island Methadone
Center I thank you all for
coming

NETWORK BOX

Burke and Stokes roll their eyes

BACK ON SHELDON

SMOOCHY
It was my original intention that
tonights performance would be a
benign mix of Smoochy songs and
ice dancing But as an artist I
believe I must convey to you my
fans what Im feeling at any
given moment in my life To do
otherwise would be dishonest Art
is communication Its something
we learn and hopefully grow from
With that in mind I hope you
enjoy the show

More applause as Smoochy skates over to the Rhinettes
They form a circle around him and slap hands in

solidarity

SHELDON
This is for Spinner

The lights go down A full orchestra begins to play the
overture to WAGNERs Tristen et Isolde The lights come

up aS a soprano -- a heavyset woman in a modified rhino
costume -- skates out through the fog and begins singing
the opera Smoochy -- now wearing a peasants frock --

skates an interpretive dance in the bg with a few
Rhinettes who are also dressed as peasants A beautiful
fairy princess floats down (on filament wire) from the
rafters and takes Smoochys hand She skates away with
him as he waves good-bye to the Rhinettes

HIGH ANGLE

LOOKING DOWN AT the opera The CAMERA PANS OVER TO the
catwalk high above the rink
CATWALK

Buggy Ding-Dong still in his Rhinette costume settles
into his assassins roost He begins to assemble the
rifle and check the scope

EXT MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - FEW MINUTES LATER

Randolph emerges from a cab and runs through the crowd
outside the Garden A few people recognize him

MAN
Its Rainbow Randolph Someone
stop him

Randolph finds a side exit and slips into the arena

INT MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - FEW MINUTES LATER

The Opera on Ice continues The soprano continues
singing as Smoochy reenacts the incidents of his recent
life The fairy princess brings Smoochy to a room with a
gleaming white desk Smoochy takes a seat behind the
desk The fairy princess places a crown on his head
bids him good-bye and floats away Smoochy sits proudly
in his new world

Suddenly Rhinettes dressed as devils glide in and skate
in a circle around the desk They throw money at Smoochy
He jumps up and skates away but the Rhinette devils

pursue him with daggers The music from the orchestra
intensifies as the drama plays out

NETWORK BOX

Nora continues to watch the opera totally entranced
Stokes and Burke look a little on edge Burke glances at
his watch

CATWALK

Buggy finishes loading the rifle He shines the barrel
with his sleeve and looks through the scope as Smoochy
and company continue to perform below
POV THROUGH RIFLE SCOPE

Atmospheric fog created by the smoke machine is so thick
that Buggy has difficulty FINDING Sheldon THROUGH the
cross-hairs Occasionally Smoochy skates through a hole
in the clouds only to disappear again BUGGY CURSES in
frustration

ARENA
Randolph pushes his way past Garden security and runs
toward the rink Several cops working the event spot
him A few spectators scream in horror
ICE RINK
The sopranos mournful aria reaches its crescendo as
Smoochy is now pursued by Rhinettes dressed as Nazis
They hold signs with words like SCANDAL and SHAME
Smoochy skates to a section of the rink resembling
Chinatown where he lands over a fallen Moochy He
cradles Moochys head in his arms as the Nazis glide past
him and disappear into the fog

Nora wipes a tear from her eye as she watches the tragedy
play out Burke and Stokes glance skyward Nora notices
this

as he quickly squeezes off a SHOT

RINK

The MUFFLED sound of GUNSHOT is absorbed by the intense
music A wounded Rhinette falls to the ice but no one
notices Smoochy oblivious continues to skate toward
the gates of heaven with the angel Moochy Giant white
gates slowly swing open at the rinks far end as floating
angels open their arms to welcome Moochy

OUTER RINK

Randolph runs around the rinks perimeter trying to get
Sheldons attention Cops and security push their way
towards Randolph He suddenly notices the felled
Rhinette on the ice and looks skyward He can make out

a rifle barrel protruding from the catwalk

NETWORK BOX
Stokes and Burke notice a commotion in the audience
They now see Randolph running through the crowd on his
way to the stairwell

monium plays out around him People are running in all

SLOW MOTION Smoochys tattered horn sails through the
air and lands softly on the ice
WIDE
Everyone in the arena screams and heads for the exits
Its pandemonium Thanks to Randolph Buggys shot was
too high and just missed Sheldons skull

A confused Sheldon bends over to pick up a chunk of the
Smoochy head

Nora whos entered at the opposite end of the rink
tries to reach him but its impossible Panicked
audience members run across the rink heading for the
exits Its chaos People slip Rhinettes get trampled

CATWALK

Randolph tries to get the rifle away from Buggy They
struggle on a narrow beam high above the rink The cops
have reached the outer edge of the catwalk now Tommy
and the boys get there a second later They all stand
back -- the catwalk is too unstable

RANDOLPH
Give me that gun you fucking
wacked-out freak

Buggy manages to shove Randolph off him He raises the
RIFLE and SHOOTS at the cops Randolph grabs him Both
he and Buggy lose their footing and slip from the
catwalk Randolph is able to grab onto the edge and hold
on Buggy clutches Randolphs leg which threatens to
bring them both down They dangle 80 feet above the
rink Randolph desperately tries to hold onto the
catwalk as Buggy clings to Randolphs ankle

CLOSE ON RANDOLPHS FINGERS

His knuckles turn white as his fingers start to slip fro
the beam

ANGLE ON BUGGY

Still clutching Randolphs ankle he starts to lose his
grip He desperately grabs Randolphs foot but
Randolphs shoe slips off and Buggy begins his long
plunge to the next life

RINK

People continue to run through the rink Felled
Rhinettes litter the ice like broken dolls Smoke fills
the air Sheldon is helping a random woman to her feet
as Nora finally reaches him She embraces him

NORA
Burkes with Stokes Hes been in

Sheldon looks toward the network box Beyond it through
the smoke he sees Burke shoving his way through people

who jam the exit trying to escape Sheldon reaches into

his costume and pulls out his gun

NORA
No Sheldon dont

Sheldon runs off leaving Nora

EXIT

Burke is almost through the cluster of people He

glances over his shoulder and sees Sheldon heading
toward him He shoves even harder now and finally

gets through

EXT MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Burke makes a run for it down 33rd Street A moment
later Sheldon emerges from the building He sees Burke
in the distance and takes off after him Hes still in
his skates and wearing the partially-blown-off Smoochy
head

FURTHER DOWN STREET
Burke looks behind and sees the nightmarish image of a
disfigured Smoochy chasing after him He quickly rounds
the corner
EXT STREET
A few moments later Sheldon rounds the corner He looks

down the street and sees no sign of Burke He notices an
alley by an abandoned building
EXT ALLEY - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Sheldon walks slowly into the alley gun drawn
Suddenly Burke jumps out from behind some boxes He
whacks Sheldons head with a garbage can lid The gun
goes flying Burke goes for it but Sheldon is quickly
on his feet and pounces on him The two men fight it
out Burke manages to get on top of Sheldon and starts
to strangle him

BURKE
You fucking point a gun at me A
gun I gave you as a gift Wheres
your fucking etiquette

Just as Sheldon begins to lose consciousness we hear a
GUNSHOT Burke looks up Nora stands there pointing
Sheldons gun directly at him

NORA
Let him go

Burke just looks at her

NORA
Now Before I pump one in that
Grecian Formula scalp of yours

Burke smirks as he releases Sheldon Sheldon jumps up
and takes the gun from Nora He shakily points it at
Burke

BURKE
You know something kid Youve
turned out to be an incredible
pain in the ass

Burke slowly stands up brushing off his suit

SHELDON
You were behind the Spinner hit

BURKE
That was a tragic mistake
(shakes head sadly)
If only one could turn back time
(beat)
But what the hell its just one
less mick in the world
He laughs

NORA
You son-of-a-bitch

Sheldon cocks the gun

BURKE
Oh my What are you gonna do
Kill me That wouldnt be very
Smoochy-like behavior

SHELDON
Youre right Theres just one
thing

Sheldon tears off the remains of his tattered costume and
steps out of it

SHELDON
Im not Smoochy

Sheldon is shaking as he extends the gun to Burkes head
SHELDON
I finally realized were living in
a different jungle

Burke suddenly looks fearful as does Nora

NORA
No Sheldon

Sheldon closes his eyes as he tries to summon up the
courage to pull the trigger

NORA
Sheldon

Suddenly theres a voice from behind

VOICE (0S)

Sheldon turns around Its Tommy and her boys

Tommy walks closer to Sheldon

TOMMY

at the gun He cant believe hes even holding it He
hands it to Tommy

SHELDON

Sheldon looks over at Burke whos petrified

SHELDON
Tommy youre not going to --

TOMMY
Dont worry Sometimes even a
rat deserves a little mercy

Sheldon and Nora take a final look at Burke before
walking out of the alley Burke is wide-eyed with fear
as Tommys boys advance on him Just as they round the
corner there is the sound of TWO GUNSHOTS Sheldon looks
at Nora

NORA
Bus backfire

She pats him on the back

EXT MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Stokes finally makes it out of the arena He runs toward
his waiting limo and hops in the back seat He barks to
his driver through the glass partition

The car doesnt move Stokes pounds on the partition

STOKES

No response Stokes frantically pushes the button that
lowers the partition It slides down

STOKES

The driver turns around Stokes recoils in horror Its
Takashi He smiles as the back doors open and the
Japanese thugs -- Chick Sambo and Tobi -- pile in with
Stokes They slam the doors shut

CHICK

Stokes lets out a small whimper Chick nods to Takashi
