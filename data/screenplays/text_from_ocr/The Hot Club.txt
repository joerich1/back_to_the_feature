TITLE THE DAMNED UNITED

2 INT BOARDROOM - ELLAND ROAD - DAY - Flashlights pop as DON REVIE (late 40s) the most
successful manager in English football walks out in front of
a pack of newspaper and TV REPORTERS He is flanked by the
Chairman of Leeds United (MANNY CUSSINS 60s) and several
other white-haired blazer-wearing members of the Board

REVIE
Im just going to make a brief
statement

CAPTION JULY 4th 1974

REVIE stands under a large trophy cabinet filled with the
silverware he has won REPORTERS wait intimidated Cowed

REVIE (contd)
Yesterday afternoon at 300 I
accepted the FAs offer to become the
next manager of the England national
football team
A gasp among the JOURNALISTS A burst of flashlights The
BOARD MEMBERS look down at the floor in silence Bereaved
fathers losing their favourite son

REVIE (contd)
Obviously that involves me leaving
Leeds United after 13 happy and
successful years which makes me very
sad Id like to think I have built
the club into a family and there must
be sadness when anybody leaves a
family However when one man goes
another steps into his place I know
who I think that person should be the
man to replace me and I shall make my
feelings clear to the directors Thank
you No further comments

REVIE turns and walks out a volley of REPORTERS shouting
questions

Niggled me David its absolutely

the people of Derby want us to

programme occasionally - I believe the
very sight of them brings the game
into disrepute (some clap in the
audience) And every time they open
their mouths it kills it Because the
very thing theyve given me a lot of
stick about over the years - about
talking too much and going on
television too much there are the
very people who can put two words
together and its rather embarrassing
to me that a man - or men - can stop
me talking to people like you I love
football Its deep it goes right
down through Its in every nerve
vein you name it It consumes me And
when I have to come and talk about I
like the passions of football to come
out Because there are not enough in
the game
