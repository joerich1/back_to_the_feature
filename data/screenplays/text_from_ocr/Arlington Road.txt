CUT IN
A YOUNG BOY’S FACE

skin pale eyes shallow pools eight or nine years old His
dry mouth opens and shuts dumbly

The child is staggering forward

EXT SUBURBAN STREET -- DAY

The BOY shuffles down the center of a residential road
Unbalanced One foot forward jerks the other to catch up

Stares blankly ahead into space

He clutches one arm to his side the other hangs limply with a
closed fist

AN APPROACHING CAR

swerves wide to pass him The driver HONKS calls a passing
get-outta-the-road Speeds off down the block

THE BOY

does not alter his course One foot forward jerks the other
Sways a little but rights himself

Another oncoming car lays on the HORN then accelerates around
him and continues on

The child staggers ahead Face drained of color

AS A THIRD CAR

brakes and swerves around him driving on--

--and then slamming on its brakes twenty yards past The
driver jumps out 35 academic-handsome but his features now
taut This is MICHAEL CONROY

MICHAEL
Kid Kid

Starts toward him hesitant The boy has not turned

Michael breaks into a run leaving his cars engine humming--
REACHING THE BOY -- NEW ANGLE
He grabs his shoulders and spins him revealing his back--

--which is a bloody mass of shredded shirt and skin fused
together The backs of his arms are similarly torn oozing
red Like a grenade went off in an unworn backpack

MICHAEL
Jesus Christwhat thewhat
happened Kid what happened
Do you hear me Can you talk

The boy’s eyes find his slack

MICHAEL
(to the block)
HELP HERE WE NEED SOME HELP
HERE

The boy relaxes his arms dropping his hidden bloody hand from
his side It has only a thumb and forefinger

The child’s other fist opens Three severed fingers hit the
asphalt

MICHAEL
(widening horror)
SOMEBODY

The boy’s eyes brim with water He’s shaking The tears are
coming And he finally lets loose a SCREAM

SMASH CUT TO
EXT SUBURBAN STREETS -- DAY

Michael’s Saturn speeds wildly passing cars running stop
signs skating dangerously through an intersection--

INT MICHAEL’S CAR

Driving panicked The boy lies in the backseat wrapped in
Michael’s sportcoat Pulling his phone to his ear

MICHAEL
You’re all right you’re almost
there just hang on--
(into phone)

INT HOSPITAL -- DAY

Michael storms through the entry carrying the now-unconscious
boy Scattering other VISITORS
MICHAEL
You Hey This kid needs surgery

more ORDERLIES who take him from Michael laying him prone--

ORDERLIES
Kid’s in shock Stretcher

Michael backs off pulled away by the nurse

NURSE
Sir what happened to him--

MICHAEL
I don’t know I found him in
the street I was driving home
he was walking in the middle
of the road

NURSE
Do you have any idea who he is
have you seen him before

MICHAEL
I yeahhe lives next door
they live right next door--

NURSE
What’s his name

Michael watches as the orderlies storm the boy down the hall
NURSE

the boy’s name
A realization settles Softly
MICHAEL
I don’t know
INT HOSPITAL -- VENDING MACHINES -- NIGHT
Michael wears a borrowed shirt carries his bloodied one in a
bag Looks tired He puts fifty cents into an automatic

coffee machine

A cup drops into position but no coffee Michael thuds on
the machine Nothing He tosses the cup away

Tries another fifty cents A cup drops into position then
the coffee starts to fill
And doesn’t stop spilling over the top

cups A long silence

CHERYL

OLIVER
He shouldn’t have been doing
what he was doing

Oliver comforts his wife Then

OLIVER

A silence Michael’s not going to ask

OLIVER

MICHAEL

CHERYL
You found him walking away

was walking away from home
OLIVER
Didn’t want us to know what
he’d been doing
(sadly)
He didn’t want us to know

Cheryl puts her head on Oliver’s shoulder Closes her eyes
Oliver looks to Michael nods and reaches out a hand

Michael gives him one of the cups of coffee

INT A DARK BEDROOM -- NIGHT

The door opens a sliver of light on a bed in which another 9-

A professional mom Grant nods shyly Cheryl walks him away

CHERYL

EXT BACKYARD -- DAY

At a patio table Brooke gets a plate full of food chatting
with a MUSTACHED MAN running a nearby barbeque grill

Some KIDS are playing tag A small circle including Grant

off his stitched-together fingers
BRODY

Watching all of the above is--
MICHAEL
standing in the back doorway with a plate of food

OLIVER (os)
Be glad you only have one to
worry about

Oliver joins him surveying the party too Michael smiles

MICHAEL
He looks in good spirits

OLIVER
So would you if you’d gotten
yourself out of school for the

You’re right I would
(off his frown)
I teach For a university

OLIVER

sessions starting next week

OLIVER
In the citywhat do you teach

MICHAEL
American history

OLIVER
Ah I was always bad with history

MICHAEL
Condemned to repeat it
OLIVER
Yes several times

MICHAEL
(smiles)
What kind of work do you do

OLIVER
Engineering architectural I
work for a company -- you know

the Falls Church Mall We’re
designing the addition for it
You want bigger stores more
parking now’s the time to ask

MICHAEL
I’ve got a class in the fall on
the 20th century as the age of
consumerism That’d be a good
name for it

OLIVER

MICHAEL
Bigger Stores More Parking

INT LIVING ROOM -- DAY -- LATER

The party dwindling outside Michael and Oliver sit in
armchairs each with drinks Gazing out the bay window

OLIVER
The work was too appealing to
pass up money was down through
the whole Midwestand we like
it here we really do I was
raised in Carson Kansas never
lived East before It’s a wonderful
part of the country

MICHAEL
The city’s falling apart

OLIVER
Well the government’s too busy in
everyone else’s backyards to pay
attention to the state of its own
All our contracts come from the
suburbs
MICHAEL
So do all our students
(beat)
It must have been the same in St
Louis though

OLIVER
What’s that

MICHAEL
I mean your contracts in St
Louis must have primarily come
from the suburbs

OLIVER
The city of St Louis is falling
apart because the city of
Washington is falling apart
Business is as healthy as it’s
ever been because Business knows
what to do with its money

As Susannah and Annemarie come running through the room hands
full of cake and frosting

OLIVER
Outta the house Girls Hey

They chase on and disappear YELPING Michael smirks

MICHAEL
You have conversations like this
back home

OLIVER
What do you mean

MICHAEL
People in Washington only think
people in Washington talk about
people in Washington

OLIVER
Well There’s the problem with
people in Washington
(beat)
They should be building shopping
malls

Michael raises his glass Oliver laughs

OUT THE WINDOW

Grant and Brody are trying to catch the evening’s first fire-

flies

They’re arguing about each other’s methods

IN THE LIVING ROOM

The two fathers have fallen silent Watching their respective
boys Michael glances over at Oliver acutely aware of this
bond they share

And settles back to the view outside

EXT GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY -- DAY
Establishing In downtown DC in the sweltering summer
INT CLASSROOM -- DAY

A modest lecture hall thirty STUDENTS scattered Electric
fans are on Michael -- in glasses sleeves rolled up -- is

AmericanTerrorism If you are
a history major this course will
count four credits as one of
your necessary electives You are
here for six weeks If you are
in this class by mistake you have
one minute to leave otherwise
youll be take hostage

The class laughs Michael turns surveys

MICHAEL

No hostages

(continues)
This is a new course it is in its
second year meaning I am still
working out the kinks -- so let
me clarify what we will not be
studying We will not be studying
the IRA the PLO Turkey
Iran or the French Revolution
This course is concerned with
terrorist acts waged in America
by Americans as a means of social
dissent which has played we
will find a part in this country’s
history since its very inception
From the Unabomber to the Boston
Tea Party

He hands a pile of syllabi to a student in the first row
MICHAEL (cont’d)

Nat Turner’s Rebellion The Lincoln
assassination The Ku Klux Klan
The Kennedy killings The World
Trade Center Federal bombings in
St Louis and Oklahoma City our
intention in this course will be
to determine what leads certain
factions to decide that their beliefs
their ends if you will may only
be realized by extremist means And
also to determine how or if certain
ends might have been prevented We
are looking for patterns of behavior

(walking to board)
There will be a midterm there will
be a final there will be -- I know
I’m a bastard -- attendance taken

The class groans

through it stopping when he sees

AN ENVELOPE

Michael frowns

INT HUNT HOUSE -- FOYER -- NIGHT

Michael nods

MICHAEL
My wife was the agent that was

OLIVER

MICHAEL
He’s his old self again when he’s

INT CONROY HOUSE -- MICHAEL’S BEDROOM -- NIGHT

Do you know what I told her I was
doing when she asked

MICHAEL

BROOKE
I’m a student I’m twenty-eight
years old and I’m still a student
MICHAEL
Lots of people are still in school
at twenty-eight

BROOKE
Studying history

MICHAEL

History is one of the few things
people don’t study to do You
want to write youwant to teach
you need the schooling

(beat)
What was this girl doing at the
Library of Congress anyway

BROOKE
Researching old advertisements
to steal their ideas

MICHAEL
Then they’re not paying her for

nothing

Brooke gives him a soft shove He smiles A beat
occuring to him

MICHAEL
You want to hear something Tell
me what you think of this JI
was next door at the Hunts’ today
talking with Oliver for awhile
and he had this blueprint like a
copy of a blueprint on a table
He said it was the Falls Church
Mall addition

BROOKE
The one he’s working on

MICHAEL
Yeah But it wasn’t

BROOKE
What do you mean it wasn’t

MICHAEL

college

BROOKE

(her point made)

She closes her eyes mocking him Firmly

MICHAEL
It was a building

He waits She opens her eyes

BROOKE

sources for my paper this weekend

He nods Happily she nestles against him

BROOKE
Then it was a building

INT GW CLASSROOM -- DAY
CLOSE ON PHOTO OF STRUCTURE

A downtown office building half of it reduced to rubble
smoke and debris The image is projected on a screen

MICHAEL (os)
Two years ago on a Monday in April
sixty-three federal employees went
to work like they always did at
the Roosevelt Federal Building
in downtown St Louis Except
on that Monday they didn’t come home
WIDEN TO REVEAL CLASSROOM
Michael clicks a remote another slide is projected

MICHAEL
In a truck parked on the street
was hidden fifty pounds of a
concentrated explosive compound
which once detonated unleashed
a force equivalent to 10000 pounds
of TNT It disintegrated the
entire street side of the building
all twelve floors -- obliterating
among numerous other offices and
a day care center the St Louis branch
of the Internal Revenue Service
which was later determined to be the
specific target of the attack

Another slide a photograph of a wiry young man David
Scobee Prematurely balding outcast-looking

MICHAEL
Not everything however went off
as planned The truck housing the
explosive belonged to a thirty-
five year-old electrician David
Scobee Scobee had recently been
released from prison for tax
evasion and was inside the vehicle
at the time of the explosion
Investigators later concluded the
device had detonated prematurely
probably as Scobee was setting the
radio receiver for the charge

Michael stops his eyes on a student in a back row

MICHAEL
Mr Kemp can you tell us anything
else about what the investigators
determined about the bombing

KEMP a burly student has his head on his desk snoozing
quietly A tape recorder is set beside him

MICHAEL
Mr Kemp

Kemp wakes with a start Looks around sees the class
snickering at him

MICHAEL
I trust you’re not staying up all
night making explosives of your
own
KEMP
(holds up recorder)
I’m taking notes It’s voice-
activated

MICHAEL
And can it also tell me something
else the investigators determined
about the bombing of the Roosevelt
Federal Building

KEMP
I’m not a morning person professor

Kemp puts his head back on his desk Michael moves on

MICHAEL

It appears we will be receiving
no insight from Mr Kemp

(concludes)
What federal investigators concluded
was that although David Scobee
‘had a history of teenage involvement -
with a paramilitary youth club
and had at times been affiliated
with various right-wing interests
no connection could be found to
indicate that the bombing was planned
with any group of co-conspirators
David Scobee had been to prison for
tax evasion and his grievances with
the IRS were no secret He was
determined to have actedalone

INT CONROY HOUSE -- GRANT’S BEDROOM -- NIGHT

Michael tucks his son in for the night clearing his bed of
books and toys sitting beside him

GRANT
Dadcan I join Scouts

MICHAEL
Scouts What do you mean like
the Boy Scouts

GRANT
Cub Scouts Brody says he’s in
a troop and they get to go
camping and on trips and learn
about fishing and tying knots
and making fires and everything

MICHAEL
You want to join in a troop
with Brody

GRANT
He says they have meetings once
a week and you wouldn’t even
have to drive because Brody’s
dad can

MICHAEL
You know when I was a little
older than you I was a Boy Scout

GRANT
You were Did you learn knots
MICHAEL
Sure But I think I forgot most
of them
GRANT

We could go camping sometime

you and me I’11 learn the knots
and you can go hunting for
cashmere mammoths

Grant smiles Michael laughs with a little relief to see him
in such good spirits He brushes his son’s hair

MICHAEL
You and me

GRANT
Yeah

MICHAEL

Let’s talk about Scouts in the
morning okay

GRANT
‘Kay

Grant rolls over Michael kisses him rises to go

GRANT
Dadis Brooke gonna live with
us
A little caught off guard
MICHAEL

Is she going to live with us

GRANT
Yeah Is she gonna take Mom’s
place

Michael returns to his bedside

MICHAEL

Little big man nobody is going
to take your mom’s place She’s
always gonna be with us--

(touches his heart)
--in here Now your dad loves
Brooke a lot and I don’t know
if she’s going to live with us
one day But if we ever start
thinking about that we’re gonna
talk about it with you first okay
Because Brooke takes Brooke’s
place that’s all Not your mom’s
Never your mom’s And she’ll
only ever live with us--

(touches heart again)
--if Mom says it’s okay too

This comforts the boy Michael strokes his hair looking at

the nightstand where a picture of Leah Conroy 30 pretty is
framed She wears an FBI windbreaker and a smile

INT CHURCH PARISH HALL -- NIGHT

side-up to his uniform The other scouts applaud

INT PARISH HALL -- LATER

At a table set out with lemonade and snacks Michael stands
with Oliver and the other dads Grant is at his side

to the next badge--

BRODY (0s)
Grant

Grant darts off to where the other scouts sit cross-legged
munching their grub To a nearby parent

MICHAEL
(bemused)
How many badges are there

DAD 1
Don’t worry they’1ll keep him
busy They get harder to come by

DAD 2
Yeah for the tough ones they
have to deliver babies and blow
the whistle on political corruption

SCOUTMASTER (os)
Oliver can I speak with you
for a moment

Oliver nods smiling leaves the group to confer in a corner
with The Scoutmaster

Michael pours himself some lemonade listens to the other dads
chattingand then glances toward the corner

OLIVER AND THE SCOUTMASTER
are talking with serious faces The Scoutmaster in

particular seems to be arguing making a point with some
vehemence Oliver shakes his head waving him off

Michael looks away then checks back

The Scoutmaster still looks angry but is keeping his voice
too low for Michael to make anything out Finally Oliver
just grins claps The Scoutmaster on the shoulder and walks
away

RETURNING TO THE FOOD TABLE
Oliver rejoins Michael Senses he’s been watching Explains

OLIVER

Oliver smiles takes his lemonade to the other dads

Michael steps to follow then takes another glance back toward
The Scoutmaster Their eyes meet

The Scoutmaster’s face relaxes and he gives a smile

EXT CONROY HOUSE -- DUSK

Michael walks the driveway to his mailbox In the Hunts’

Collecting his mail

MICHAEL

OLIVER
Michael I’m sorry Brody invited
him for dinner over here tonight
I though he’d asked you

MICHAEL
Oh well--

GRANT
Can I eat with Brody dad

Michael looks at Oliver shrugs

MICHAEL
As long as it’s okay with Brody’s
father I guess tonight--

OLIVER
Thanks Michael

He resumes entertaining the kids Michael heads back to his
house flipping through the mail

-and stops when he sees another letter from the University
of Pennsylvania addressed to Oliver Hunt with the Please
forward to handwritten address

Michael frowns turns to call to Oliver

--but something stops him He looks at the parent next door
giving a piggyback ride to his own son Grant looks again at
the letter and sticks it with the rest of his mail Walks on
inside

INT CONROY HOUSE -- KITCHEN -- CONTINUOUS

Brooke is chopping vegetables the sink running Michael
rops the mail on a table walks behind her

MICHAEL

He presses to her starts kissing the back of her neck

BROOKE
Mmmnmmmmm

She tosses aside the knife and veggies turns and mashes her
lips to his Exaggeratedly forcing herself on him The both
of them laughing backing out of the room

Leaving the sink running as they go

CLOSE ON MAIL ON THE TABLE

with the alumni letter to Oliver poking out of the pile

INT MICHAEL’S OFFICE -- DAY

CLOSE ON LETTER

A small teacher’s office one window overlooking DC streets
Michael holds the letter in hand tapping it thoughtfully

Finally he picks up the phone and dials

MAN’S VOICE
Good afternoon U Penn

MICHAEL
Hi Transcript office please

A pause as his call is transferred

WOMAN’S VOICE
Transcript office

MICHAEL

Hello I’m calling from George
Washington University We have
a student who has applied for
graduate work in our history
program and I needed to get a
copy of his undergraduate record
from your school He’s been out
of school for some time

(beat)
The name is Oliver Hunt

INT GW LIBRARY -- DAY

An open area of research tables where Brooke sits surrounded
by piles of books and papers Michael is beside her

MICHAEL
Just listen to this tell me if
you don’t think it’s strange

BROOKE
Michael you’re spying on your
neighbor

MICHAEL

The University of Pennsylvania
keeps sending him alumni stuff for
a 15-year reunion He says he went
to Kansas they must have him mixed
up with some other Oliver Hunt

So I called Penn got Oliver Hunt’s
undergraduate transcript

BROOKE
This isthis may be criminal
Michael

MICHAEL

Listen to me the Oliver Hunt
at U Penn had a completely
different physical description
and was not an architectural
engineering major
Brooke gives

BROOKE
So they do have him mixed up
with someone else--

MICHAEL
Butthis other Oliver Hunt
was the same age as Oliver was
in the same class as Oliver
andalso came from Carson
Kansas Oliver’s home town

BROOKE
What are you getting at You
just said they’re two different
people

MICHAEL
Two people the same age and
from the same home town I
looked it up Brooke it’s a
small town

BROOKE
Michael What

MICHAEL

They would have known each other
Don’t you think Heard of each
other at least growing up
Gotten mixed up before

(troubled)
Oliver didn’t say anything like
that He just threw the letter
away

BROOKE

There could be ten other Michael
Conroys here in Falls Church
and you’d probably never know

(beat)
I can’t believe we’re having this
conversation I can’t believe
you did this How would you like
it if he was checking up on you

MICHAEL
So I called the University of
Kansas

him a level look 4He’s beyond comprehension

MICHAEL
Here’s what I’m getting at
the University of Kansas had no
record of an Oliver Hunt

(MORE)

MICHAEL (cont’d)
From that year from that class
from any year From any class
So either he didn’t really go to
Kansas
(beat)
-Or that’s not his real name

He waits

BROOKE
Can I ask you something Did
you do this kind of thing to me
when we started dating

MICHAEL
Brooke--

BROOKE
Get my transcripts Call my
ex-boyfriends

MICHAEL
-you’ve got to admit that
something’s not right here--

BROOKE
This isn’t right You are
investigating your nextdoor
neighbor for God’s sake And
for what Pleaseexplain that
to me What Michael did he do

Unable to give her a good answer

MICHAEL
Something’s not right

She fixes him with a chastening look And goes back to her
research End of discussion

INT HUNT HOUSE -- OLIVER’S STUDY -- NIGHT

Oliver and Cheryl are giving Michael and Brooke dressed for a
dinner party a little tour of the house Entering

CHERYL
And this is Oliver’s study in
here the only place he can get
away from the kids--

The walls have framed pictures on them though not photos
they are all drawings various architectural sketches

BROOKE
What are these all the projects

you’ve built

OLIVER

(laughs)

I wish no I collect sketches
blueprints -- designs of buildings
This one here’s an original floor
plan for Monticellohere that’s
the Woolworth Building

CHERYL

It’s his hobby

BROOKE
(identifying one)

St Louis Arch

OLIVER

Correct

BROOKE
Hey nothing gets by me

She indicates some rolled-up drawings in a corner A thought

BROOKE
So all these drawings theyre
not just for your job then

OLIVER

No

BROOKE
So they’re not all shopping malls

OLIVER
No I don’t know of any
architecturally significant

shopping malls

CHERYL
Oh honey you just haven’t built

them yet

She pats him Oliver smiles
Michael as if to Say -- well

Michael looks unconvinced

Brooke raises her eyes at
that explains your building

INT HUNT HOUSE -- DINING ROOM -- LATER

The four of them finishing dinner The wine glasses now
empty discussion around the table is animated
OLIVER
When we talk about a country what
we are really talking about is an
economy A manner of distributing
the wealth of its citizens

BROOKE
Or lack thereof

CHERYL
(despairing)
Ohh we’ve talked about cars we’ve
talked about sports now we have
to talk about politics--

OLIVER
When we vote what are we voting
for How we want our taxes
distributed

BROOKE
That’s not always true

OLIVER
It’s true So why then is it
a radical idea to allow individual
citizens to decide how they want
their tax monies spent Why
should ten cents of every dollar
I earn go to the national defense
if say I’d rather that ten
cents went to fixing up roads and
highways

MICHAEL
Because you could conceivably be
left with a country with no
national defense

BROOKE
But hey great fucking roads

OLIVER
See that is taking the
traditionalist’s view which says
you can’t leave decisions to the
American people because they’11
fuck things up We say we live in
a democracy but not really The
founders didn’t give us a true
democracy they set up all their
safeguards to insure that decisions
would not get to be made by people
like you and I
CHERYL
I’m gonna get a headache

MICHAEL
Those safeguards are to make sure
the country isn’t run according
to trends Ideas that might be
temporarily in fashion

OLIVER
Radical views

MICHAEL
Sure Radical views

OLIVER
Like the world being round or
that women should vote--

MICHAEL

Which were accepted in time--
OLIVER

Long after they couldve been

(beat)
See the problem with a country
that is governed by those we trust
to be our best and brightest is
that in order to get to where they
can be perceived as such they have
to conform to a set of political

interests Which become self-interests

CHERYL
I give upI’m taking the plates--

As she circles the table collecting dishes

BROOKE
Cheryl here let me help you--

OLIVER
Look why is there such resistance
whenever there’s a third party
movement Because even with a
two-party system you can confine
who has control Whether you’re
a Republican or Democrat if you’re
a politician you agree on one
thing the average American does
not have the capacity to make an
informed decision about what is
good for the country

MICHAEL
Any bill before Congress should
be up for popular vote

OLIVER
That’s not what I’m saying I’m
simply saying that there is
something fundamentally wrong
with the notion that the government
is the government because it knows
what’s right and the people are
the people because they don’t

There’s a cool insistence in his voice He smiles
Meanwhile headed for the kitchen

CHERYL
Anyone want dessert Apple pie
hah-hah

She and Brooke disappear Michael eyes Oliver nodding
slightly with great interest

OLIVER (vo)
Let me tell you what I mean

EXT HUNT HOUSE -- BACKYARD -- NIGHT
Michael and Oliver strolling across watching the stars

OLIVER
My father once owned some land by
the Fork River in Kansas Just an
acre or two but it’d belonged to
my father’s father and his grand-
father before that Not enough to
farm on but my dad always meant

to build a home there -- a cabin
maybe -- when he retired
(beat)

Well the state of Kansas at that
time was lobbying for a federal
power plant project that’d bring
Kansas a lot of money and tax breaks
Nuclear project And the state’s
surveying people decided the perfect
spot for it was on the Fork River
Part of that my father’s land

MICHAEL
So they bought your father out
OLIVER
Tried to But it was his right to
keep what he owned They made him
various offersthen pretty soon
started making threats

MICHAEL
The government

OLIVER

Wasn’t that the land really mattered
to him or the moneyso there wasn’t
anything they could do except find
away around him Have one senator
cut a deal with anothertack a line
of legislation to a bill -- nothing
anyone’d think mattered

(beat)
One day my father had a riverbank
in his familythe next it’d
somehow been federal property all
along

MICHAEL
And he got nothing

OLIVER
He’d had the right to that land
So when they had no other choice
to get what they wanted all they
had to do was take his right to it
away
a rueful smile)

Shoulda thought of that from the
start

Michael waits him out hoping to learn more

OLIVER
My father was a citizen of their
state and their country so they
claimed the right to decide what
he needed

At the back door Cheryl and Brooke appear

CHERYL
We have lemon cake oatmeal raisin
cookies and some popsicles that
the kids didn’t like

OLIVER
Lemon cake honey
(back to Michael)
And they never built that power
plant

MICHAEL
They never built it
(calls off)
Cheryl cake’s great for me too--

OLIVER
Never built it

The women are gone again They’ve stopped walking

OLIVER
My dad grew old without the river
hed always wanted No river
No river by his side

Lost for a moment A summer suburban silence

OLIVER
Ive known far too many people
Michael who were under the thumb of
the federal government Presumption
being of course that their
government’s intentions were to help

Shadows play across his face as he turns to Michael Looking
for a reaction

Michael nods

INT CONROY HOUSE -- HALLWAY -- NIGHT

Michael and Brooke back from dinner pass Grant’s closed
door Sounds of two boys playing inside

Michael stops taking off his tie knocks on the door

MICHAEL
Little big man We’re back

As the envelope is unwrapped revealing a college yearbook
dated Class of 1982

Michael opens it turning the pages to the student photos

He runs his finger down the namesHollis Hoberman Hudson

Hunter Huntleythere is no Hunt No Oliver Hunt

Michael frowns starts turning pages forwards then backwards
stopping as something suddenly catches his eye He plants his
finger on--
A PICTURE OF OLIVER
fifteen years younger smiling dutifully at camera
Michael runs his finger across the pageto the name
“FENIMORE WILLIAM
Closing the book Michael sets it on his desk and looks to
the window His thoughts starting to turn

EXT CHURCH PARKING LOT -- DAY

A group of CUB SCOUTS is being helped onto a charter bus
destination Camp Occoquan PARENTS are loading luggage

Michael is with Grant in his Scout uniform

MICHAEL
I want you always sticking with

tent too far from anybody

GRANT
I’1l be with Brody We stay

MICHAEL

Well just ‘cause Brody wants

to explore somewhere doesn’t mean

Grant rolls his eyes nods

MICHAEL
Okay You get lonely you get
homesick you just tell the
grownups there and have them call

GRANT
Dad they’re getting on the bus--

MICHAEL
All right okay You have a

Grant nods mechanically pulling away Michael gives hima
hug then lets him go Grant jogs to the bus looks back at
his father--

--and hurries back over with a crooked smile He grabs his
dads hand twists the fingers around bangs elbows twice

GRANT
(grins)
That’s the secret handshake
He darts back to the bus climbs in Michael smiles
AT HIS CAR

Brooke is perched on the hood Michael returns to join her

BROOKE
Two weeks Not long

MICHAEL
He’s never been away from home
before

BROOKE

Remember the first time you got

MICHAEL
That’s different My camp had
Girl Scouts

Grant waves at them from a bus seat window Michael
meanwhile glances across some cars where

OLIVER AND CHERYL

are saying their goodbyes to Brody Cheryl gives hima
resisted hug Oliver spanks him off to the bus

Oliver sees Michael looking his way He smiles
ON FULL SCENE

All the gathered parents watch and wave as the bus pulls out
of the parking lot

MICHAEL (vo)
The Federal Bureau of Investigation
keeps a central database which
contains a file on every American
who has ever been charged with a
crime

(MORE)

MICHAEL (vo cont’d)
Whether convicted or not Certain
offenses cause files to be flagged
meaning that agents are assigned
to procure periodic follow-up
information on those persons their
friends and families

INT GW CLASSROOM -- DAY
Michael is in the midst of another lecture continuing

MICHAEL

Things that would cause a file
to be flagged could be anything
from a known association with
organized crime passing counterfeit
currency involvement with militant
or extremist groups or the
ownership or sale of illegal firearms
chemical agents or explosives

(beat)
The purpose of the flags are to
construct a net that will help to
identify those criminal elements
whose target could potentially be
the government itself A net to
track terrorists

Michael flips a light switch hits his remote a family photo
of a fortyish man -- Tyler Parsons -- his wife three sons
aged 18 16 and 10 Rural-looking standing before a cabin

MICHAEL
Three years ago that database
picked up a series of suspicious
firearms purchases in Georgia
North Carolina and Maryland Over
100 guns from assault rifles to
Army-issue revolvers bought by
residents in each state who were
all known acquaintances of this man
Tyler Parsons An amateur gun
collector and a vocal member of
the right-wing extremist community
of Copper Creek Virginia

Michael switches slides a wide shot of the mountain cabin

MICHAEL
To the FBI it appeared Parsons
was stockpiling weapons Why
they didn’t know

(MORE)

MICHAEL (cont’d)
So they sent three agents to Copper
Creek armed with a search warrant
expecting to find illegally-owned
firearms as well

Slide change a fence to the property a dirt road beyond
leading up the mountain As Michael talks he walks among the
desks of his students

MICHAEL
At the fence to the property the
agents encountered Parsons’ youngest
son Age ten They asked the boy
if he lived there if his dad was
home but never identified
themselves as FBI The boy
according to the agents’ affidavits
immediately took off running up
the road toward the house screaming
They’re coming They’re coming

Michael reaches the desk of Kemp who is asleep again his
tape recorder on Michael takes the recorder shuts it off
And pockets it

MICHAEL
At the cabin steps the child picked
up a rifle and fired at the agents
who took cover As more shots
came from inside the agents were
forced to return fire The siege
went on for twenty minutes When
it was over Parsons’ youngest son
and wife had been killed His two
older sons injured Parsons himself
had not been home

Michael returns to the front Closes his eyes briefly

MICHAEL
A female FBI agent also lost
her life

Another slide a cache of guns in a cellar

MICHAEL
The FBI had believed its agents
were closing in on a terrorist plot
But what their central database did
not tell them was that Tyler Parsons
had recently come into a small
inheritance with a relative’s death
with which he arranged for all these
weapons to be legally purchased

(MORE)

MICHAEL (cont’d)

Nor did it tell them that Parsons
had recently applied for a license
as a gun dealer a license still
pending approval

(beat)
Nor did it tell them that Parsons
had warned his family repeatedly
that there might be people keen on
stealing his collectioninstructing
his wife and sons never to let anyone
near the house when he was away

He flips slides again back to the Parsons family photo

MICHAEL
Tyler Parsons was not a terrorist
Tyler Parsons had committed no
crime But three people died that
day

(finally)

Because the flags went up And
the flags were wrong

INT MICHAEL’S OFFICE -- DAY
Michael is on the phone the Kansas yearbook in front of him

MICHAEL
Hello my name is Michael Conroy
and I’m calling from George
Washington University in Washington
DC I’m an admissions director
We’ve received some documents from
a prospective student and I just
wanted to verify the state’s record
of a legal change of nameI’m
afraid I don’t have the year

RECORDS CLERK
(over phone)
A Kansas resident sir

MICHAEL
At the time I believe so The
name was William Fenimore From
Carson Kansas Changed I’m told
to an Oliver Hunt

RECORDS CLERK
It may take me a few moments sir

MICHAEL
That’s fine I’1ll stay on
INT OFFICE -- MOMENTS LATER

Michael taps at the photo of William Fenimore in the
yearbook waiting Then

RECORDS CLERK
Sir We do have a record of change
of name for a William Fenimore of
Carson Kansas to Oliver Hunt

MICHAEL
Could you tell me when that was

RECORDS CLERK
October fifth nineteen-eighty-five

Michael writes 10585 in the yearbook

MICHAEL

Thank you that’s the information
I was looking for--

(an afterthought)
Oh you knowmaybe there’s
something else you could check
for me Is there possibly a name
change record for an Oliver Hunt
From the same town Carson

RECORDS CLERK
Changed from Oliver Hunt

MICHAEL
Yes I’m afraid I don’t know
what it might have been changed to

RECORDS CLERK
(a little annoyed)
It may take a few moments sir

MICHAEL
That’s fine

He waits Scribbling further on the notepad
FENIMORE --- UKANSAS82 --- 10585 OLIVER HUNT
HUNT --- UPENN82 --- 22
The clerk returns to the line
RECORDS CLERK
Sir I’m afraid we have no record

of any name change for an Oliver
Hunt of Carson Kansas

MICHAEL
Oh I see

RECORDS CLERK
Our records indicate Oliver Hunt
of Carson Kansas was deceased as of
October fourth nineteen-eighty-five
Michael darkens

MICHAEL
October fourth

RECORDS CLERK

Yes sir

MICHAEL
You have a copy of the death
certificate

RECORDS CLERK
(pauses)
You had said you were calling
from a university

MICHAEL
Yes thank you

He hangs up Looks at his diagram
FENIMORE --- U KANSAS 82 --- 10585 OLIVER HUNT
HUNT --- UPENN82 --- 10485 RIP

He draws a circle around the dates

EXT FBI HEADQUARTERS -- STREET OPPOSITE -- DAY

Michael is with Whit dressed for work finishing a lunch-
truck sandwich Walking the busy sidewalk

MICHAEL
Just run through the scenario
with me Theoretically Why
would someone do that

WHIT
Change his name to the name of
a person who died one day before

MICHAEL
A person the same age and from
the same hometown Why To
take over that person’s life

They reach a

WHIT
That wouldn’t work Michael
When someone dies that death
certificate goes to both state
and federal governments banks
are notified social security
numbers driver’s licenses --
they’re voided You wouldn’t do
it to become that other person

MICHAEL
Then why would you do it
WHIT
You’d do it to hide the person

you were
ledge with view of the monuments Sitting

WHIT
Let’s say you wanted to find out
Say a criminal record for this
guy -- prior to the name change
Well unless you knew what you
were looking for--

MICHAEL
--you’d check under his current
name - -

WHIT

--and the record you’d find back
then would be for someone else
entirely That’s the significance
of changing names one day after

a person -- a name -- died

MICHAEL
There’d be no overlap to tell
you you’re confusing two different
people

WHIT
If you change your name to a
name that never existed before
it doesn’t take someone too long
to figure out they should be
checking your past under a
different alias

MICHAEL
But if you change your name to
a name that used to be a real
person--

WHIT
--most people wouldn’t think
there’s reason to check elsewhere
than that real person’s real past

MICHAEL

Gives you a whole new history
WHIT

Or helps your old one disappear

(beat)
You read in the paper someone’s
died he’s your age born where
you wereto most of the world
you could basically hide your
background behind his

Michael thinks for a moment Gravely

MICHAEL
Whit If I give you a name could
you run it for flags

Whit almost falls off the ledge

WHIT
Jesus Christ Michael

MICHAEL
One time Just one

WHIT
Check FBI files as a personal
favor that’s what you’re asking
me to do

MICHAEL
I’d never tell anyone

WHIT
You don’t get fired for that
you go to jail for that

MICHAEL
It’s important

WHIT
Why Your girlfriend hiding
something from you Some student
whose looks you don’t like Do
you see the problem here

MICHAEL
No it’sit’s a feeling
WHIT
Michael If you’d asked Leah to
do it she would have said the
same thing You’re asking me to
access you classified government
information I love you baby
but that I cannot do

Michael nods aware he’s asking too much
WHIT
Look You want to find out
about somebodythere are always

ways to do it But they’re not
through me

rolled-up architectural drawings Unfurls a couple looking

for the one he’d seen that day on the coffee table

Rolls them back up tries to peer into the tubes of a couple
others Doesn’t have time to go through them all

He moves to the desk opens the top drawers Rifling through
papers drawing implements T-squares

Finds nothing

Frustrated he leans against the desk looking aroundand
then focusing on

THE FRAMED FLOOR PLAN OF MONTICELLO
hanging on the wall The frame is slightly askew
Michael steps to take a closer look

One corner of the drawing has inadvertently curled over
There appears to be another sheet of paper lying underneath

MICHAEL

listens to the TV cartoons blare on and lifts the frame from
the wall His back is to the door

He feels along the frame separating it from the back mount
and as it comes apart--

THE STUDY DOOR OPENS

MICHAEL
I mean that wasn’t a building
Oliver had ever done work on or
the electrician who’d set the
bomb he wasn’t someone youd
heard ofOliver’d heard of
being in sorta that area of work

CHERYL
I’m not sure I understand what
you’re asking Michael -

MICHAEL
I’m teaching a classa history
class that addresses terrorism
and it’s one of the things we
cover the St Louis incident
I keep meaning to ask Oliver
about it since you lived there
whether it was something that
affected you at all

Cheryl looks at him somewhat oddly
CHERYL

Well We had a babysitter whose
aunt was killed

MICHAEL
Uh-huh
CHERYL
As far as -- I don’t know what

you’re asking -- engineering
questions you’d really have to
ask Oliver

MICHAEL
Well Yeah I will

He’s backing out of the room to go
CHERYL
I didn’t know you taught a course
about terrorism Michael That’s
quite a frightening subject

She’s still smiling pleasantly at him Something unnerving
about it He nods

great lengths to hide it I’m
sayinghe lived in St Louis

closes the door grabbing the dog by the scruff

The dog bares teeth and rushes Michael He leaps onto a
couch higher to a side table and clutches a bookshelf near

MICHAEL
Hey Jesus what--

EXT FRONT PORCH -- DAY

Michael sits with girl-faced Mrs Peters both regarding the
house next door Wolf playing with neighbor kids again

YOUNG MOM
All I can tell you is what we
told the FBI back then They
were nice people they always
acted normal we babysat their
kids a few times We only moved
in three years ago so we only
knew them a little while

MICHAEL
What exactly did the agents ask
you

YOUNG MOM

Ohh if we ever thought they were
doing anything suspicious If
they talked about politics with
us What groups we knew they
were involved in they were in
everything church things
Neighborhood Watch stuff for the
kids

MICHAEL
Did the agents tell you why they
were asking

YOUNG MOM
They said they were investigating
all sorts of people They
interviewed us two times That was
back when everyone thought that
bomber couldn’t have done it alone

MICHAEL
But you told them you’d never seen
anything strange next door

YOUNG MOM
Never They were nice people

MICHAEL
And the way they were acting
around the time of the bombing --
just before just after

YOUNG MOM
They were nice people

Michael frowns He’s getting nothing
MICHAEL
What about work Oliver Do you
know where he worked

YOUNG MOM
An architecture firm Or
construction I don’t remember
somewhere around here

MICHAEL
Not anywhere downtown

YOUNG MOM
Oh no That’s twenty miles
from here Why -- is he doing
something different now

MICHAEL
Something different

YOUNG MOM
A different job I remember they
were moving to Washington he
said he didn’t have a job yet He
was going to find something there

Michael stares at her a long moment

MICHAEL
He didn’t have a job before
they moved

YOUNG MOM
No because my husband asked
him where--

MICHAEL
Did they tell you why they
were moving To Washington

He shrugs

YOUNG MOM
He said there’d be work there

Michael ponders this The girl studies him

MICHAEL
When he was a teenager he tried
to leave a bomb in a building
A company -- working for the
government -- that had cheated
his father That’s why the FBI
interviewed you about him after
St Louis They were looking at
anyone with a past

YOUNG MOM
When I was 12 I was arrested for
peeing on a junior high That’s
gonna follow me forever

Michael manages a smile Perhaps something about her reminds
him of Brooke She continues

YOUNG MOM
I don’t understand If the FBI
decided he wasn’t involved what
makes you
(trails off)
What made you come all this way
What exactly did you see

He doesn’t answer The girl looks off to the house

but unless I can find a connection

Two years

ALAN
Seemslonger

You’re a professor you say
I taught things once

He pauses seems to gather his strength
ALAN
I’ve been through all this before
Government the police then
writers Everyone wanted to
believe it was political Part
of a conspiracy part of a group
Abby and I too David wasn’t a

sStrongboy he was impressionable

Believed what friends around him
saidwhy couldn’t he get involved

with people who could talk him into

even this

(resigned)
The police the FBI they found
nothing It was him alone They
decided this Sixty-three people
dead Over taxes David alone

MICHAEL
And do you now believe that

ALAN
Iwill neverbelieve that

MICHAEL
Have you ever heard the name
Oliver Hunt Or William Fenimore

The older man shakes his head

ALAN
I have heard too many names

MICHAEL
Your son was an electrician Had
he ever been employed by any
engineering firms Companies
involved in construction--

ALAN
He worked the same place ten years
Tarry Electrical Right downtown

MICHAEL
I’ve been to see them

ALAN

He did his time they took him back

MICHAEL
He never did any work out in the
suburbs
(Scobee shakes head)
The people he knew his friends--

ALAN
(losing patience)
They were all checked neighbors
customers people he grew up with
all this long ago Two years--

MICHAEL
The man I think knew your son
would have been thirty-six Worked
in architectural engineering
lived in the western suburbs In
St Louis for years grew up in
Kansas strong feelings on politics
A son and two daughters a wife
they go to church he’s made
himselfa normal life

He trails off realizing the futility of how this sounds

ALAN
Professor May I ask you why
youre so sure this man of yours
waS a part of what happened here

MICHAEL
The same reason youre sure
David didn’t act alone

Michael looks around hoping to find some inspiration some
cluebut there is nothing Resigned he looks again to the
older man

MICHAEL
I had to come here You must
understand I had to try

Dr Scobee nods imperceptibly

MICHAEL
I’m sorry to bring it back

ALAN
It never goes away

Michael muses turns for the door Reaching it

ALAN
Professor ConroyI know my son
didn’t act alone because ten children
died that day That day care center
in the building He had to know
it was there David would have
never done anything to harm children
Not on his own

MICHAEL

looking desperately for a cab Behind him the man he almost
ran over leaves the building walking down the street
Michael starts the other way Then freezes

Something has registered

He turns around Watches the man walking off Dressed
casually moving quick

Michael darkens

MICHAEL
Sir

The man turns It’s The Technician who had been perched on
the phone pole in Falls Church And also the same bearded man
from Brody’s welcome-home party who’d been manning the grill
Whether or not Michael recognizes him the man thinks he has
And takes off running

Michael immediately breaks in pursuit

--and inside disappearing Michael scrambles up racing for
the school at top speed--

AS DOZENS AND DOZENS OF SCHOOLCHILDREN

He jams his key in the ignition

EXT HUNT HOUSE -- NIGHT
Approaching the block the street becomes lined with cars At
the house the driveway is packed five cars crammed A few
lights on MUSIC playing many VOICES
Above the house a few flashes of colored LIGHT as sparklers
are being tossed high in the air

ON THE STREET

Michael’s car creeps by Headlights off Inside Michael
looks worn eyes checking everything he passes on edge

He rolls into his driveway at an angle Stopping halfway into
his yard Climbs out of the car

FROM THIS ANGLE

He can glimpse the 4th of July party being held in the Hunts’
backyard Reminiscent of Brody’s welcome-home party ADULTS
talking KIDS playing barbecue music

Michael shuts the car door

Thirty maybe forty GUESTS milling about Eating Laughing

Michael looks to his right sees The Delivery Man that Brooke
had seen at the warehouse Talking to a teenage GIRL He
glances up catches Michaels eye Holds it Looks away
AT THE BARBECUE

The Technician wears a madras shirt holding a plate of hot
dogs Serving them up to Susannah and Annemarie

The Scoutmaster looks over sees Michael tells Cheryl She
looks up Stone-faced Then resumes their conversation

makes his way through the crowd studying every face
Husbands in golf shirts wives in sundresses teenagers around
a radio a loner who looks awkward at parties

He moves toward the house

THE SCOUTMASTER AND CHERYL

split up He toward the barbecue She toward the children
AT THE PORCH

Michael stops the guests seeming to give him a wide circle to
himself All still chatting and eating

Sensing a presence behind him Michael turns

From the study

stirs his drink face expressionless Then turns his back
INT STUDY -- NIGHT

Oliver flanked by his pictures of buildings is waiting as
Michael enters A television is on the fireworks display
downtown -- a lightshow over the Mall

Michael looks to the windowand the party outside

What to anyone would look like a normal suburban party seems
to him a coven of witches
No response

Michael turns Oliver smiles No trace of menace

neighborly

OLIVER
You’ve been asking questions
about me Michael
(beat)
What would possess you to do
something like that

OLIVER
You should have come to me
if there was something you
wanted to know

MICHAEL

(lightly)
-well then I imagine we’1ll

MICHAEL
He’s nine years old

OLIVER

MICHAEL (cont’d)
David was just the one who drove
in with the bomb His history
with the IRS people just
assumed he was in it alone

Oliver looks almost amused

MICHAEL
And now the rest of you are here

As he finds a little strength

MICHAEL

How hard has it been to keep it
all secret How careful have you
had to beall of youwith that
moment in your past you know will

PEOPLE are you going to KILL

EXT KEY BRIDGE -- DAY

Michael and Whit stand at the railing the Potomac below
Beyond them the spires of Washington’s landmarks the
Monument the Capitol Lincoln Memorial Kennedy Center

WHIT

He did time as a minor for
trying to leave a homemade bomb
in a mailroom in Kansas City
Twenty-two years ago before he
changed his name Not a charge
on his record every since He
was one of the thousand guys we
looked at after the St Louis
bombing because of his background
since he was living there at the
time But he and everybody he was
known to be close to came up clean

(beat)
Any other information I should
know about

Michael looks over the river Says nothing

WHIT
Is that what you found out The
Kansas City thing when he was
sixteen Got you thinking
(beat)
People hide their pasts for a
lot of reasons

MICHAEL
Some don’t have to

WHIT
Do you have something on this
guy or not Or do you just not
like him in your neighborhood

Michael remains silent Exasperated

WHIT

If you’ve got nothing Michael
if this is all you have to tell
me then you shouldn’t be teaching
this class again Because it’s
getting inside your head

(beat)
You can tell me there’s something
to go on and I‘1l go But I
won’t walk into another Copper
Creek Neither should you

Michael is looking at the monuments

Would you have traded mine

Whit doesn’t answer Wearily
WHIT
There was no tap on your phone

CLOSE ON PHOTO PROJECTION

of the World Trade Center The aftermath of the bombing

MICHAEL (0os)
The men who targeted this building
did not do it to destroy any
institution No terrorist could
do that Nor did they do it to
throw the country’s financial
markets into chaos nor to strike
a blow at any government offices
There were none inside

CLOSE ON MICHAEL

lecturing but wearing this time pondering the words with
haggard weight

MICHAEL
They did it to strike a blow at
a symbol Of a system Which
they wanted to see one day fall
And had they not been caught
they would have continuedto
attack such symbols with these
methodsuntil they were found
or until these strikes turned the
country to their view that it
was not they who were the enemy
but the system

For a long time

MICHAEL
Mr Kemp Glad you’re with us

KEMP
You said that four people were
charged and convicted in the
bombing As being conspirators

MICHAEL
That’s right

KEMP
What about the other people who
knew Maybe they weren’t in on
it but I mean you figure
there were others who knew what
was going on Right Maybe
they didn’t know it was a bombing
but they knew something was gonna
happen at the Trade Center Or
maybe they didn’t know where
but they knew there was gonna
be a bomb

MICHAEL
Yes Mr Kemp

KEMP
What happened to those people

MICHAEL
What do you mean

vehicles everywhere Chaos Our vantage is circling

NEWS REPORTER (v0)
We are in downtown Washington
DC where an explosion has just
destroyed two entire wings of
the headquarters of the FBI
No word yet on the number of
casualties the damage though
as you can see looks very severe
No one yet has claimed responsibility
for the attackwe’re trying to
get information on what’s going on
down there just as fast aS we can

As this segues into another news report

2ND REPORTER (v0o)
Witnesses say they saw a man in
a rental car force his way through
the gate there that leads to the
garage No word yet on who or why
only that this can now officially
be called the worst terrorist act
in United States history

Cross-fading into another broadcast

3RD REPORTER (vo)
Preliminary reports indicate the
bombing was the work of this
man Michael Conroy a professor
of history at George Washington
University who had instructed
courses on terrorism Officials
will not confirm reports that
the bombing had anything to do
with the death of Mr Conroy’s
wife who had been an FBI agent

Dissolving into another angle another news crew’s camera

1ST REPORTER (vo)
Investigators are now focusing
on the prospect that Conroy blamed
the Bureau for its role in his
wife’s death two years ago
Specifically sources speculate
his target may have been Field Agent
Whit Carver who was one of the
hundred and eighty-four people to
perish in the attack

2ND REPORTER (vo)
Students and colleagues both say
Conroy’s behavior was increasingly
erratic in the weeks leading up
to the bombing

3RD REPORTER (vo)
and it may have been that very
auto accident which took someone else
away from him that pushed him over
the edge

1ST REPORTER (vo)
Yet all of them described Conroy as
solitary but friendly as a talented
professor fascinated by the American
underground and as a loving father
to his nine-year old son

2ND REPORTER
And so after exhausting hundreds

of thousands of man-hours and leads
federal investigators are finally

ready to say that -- much like the
IRS bombing two years ago in
St Louis -- this summer’s attack

on the FBI was the work of
one manand one man alone

Reporting from Washington Charles

The screen zaps off Grant looks up to see Oliver standing
with the remote He sits on the sofa

OLIVER
Come here

Grant shuffles to him sits beside Oliver pulls him tight
with an arm around him

OLIVER

I want you to remember something
No matter what anyone says to
you any kids at school anybody
you ever meet for the rest of
your life you remember this

(beat)
Your dad was a hero He was
the bravest man I’ve ever known
Do you know why Because he
believed in something And no
matter how many people told him
he shouldn’t or told him he
was wrong he didn’t change what
he believed To do something
like that you have to be very
brave

Grant continues to look glum Oliver tips up his chin
OLIVER
But that’s not why your dad was
a hero Your dad was a hero
because he was right
Oliver nods Grant nods too

OLIVER
And don’t you ever forget

Grant gives a smile Oliver ruffles his hair and helps him
back off the couch

OLIVER

former Conroy house next door

Where the lawn is overgrown some windows broken and the home
is dark and empty

It’s the kind of house that makes you shudder when you drive
