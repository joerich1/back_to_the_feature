INT TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT

A MAN and WOMAN sleep peacefully in the sunken bedroom of an upscale Boston
townhouse in the near future The plush decor is tasteful but indulgent
Sharper Image meets 2015 A small digital hologram floats in mid air beside
the

bed 205 am

CAMERA BOOMS DOWN

Revealing the man CASE in CUEarly thirties Fine features There is a
tension about him even at rest LINDA LEE the young woman curled up beside
him

has a soft natural beauty thats enhanced by the innocence of sleep

Cases eyes flash openHe senses something wrong

There is a subtle CLICK from across the open living room

Suddenly theres a deafening EXPLOSION as the front door is blown off its
hinges A black hexagon the size of a baseball is lobbed into the room

CASE

Reacts instantly pulling Linda Lee to the floor

THE HEXAGON

Ignites with a flash of white-hot magnesium fire It emits a continuous
blinding

flare that permeates the room

CASE

Blinded by the flare frantically pulls open a bedside drawer and fumbles for
his gun
THE DOOR

Two heavily armed SENSENET POLICEMEN kick their way through the smoking
remains

of the door Pitch black welders goggles protect their eyes from the glare
as

they charge into the room

CASE

Is mercilessly beaten to his knees by the policemens electrified shock
staves

LINDA LEE

Makes a break for it but shes backhanded by Policeman 1 and recoils
against
the wall

ANGLE ON THE DOOR

A gaunt foreboding looking MAN in a long great coat now enters His pale
clean

shaven head and angular features give him a skull like appearance as he gazes
through the blue-white glare with obsidian goggles He regards the semi-
conscious Case for a moment then nods to his men

Two Policemen sweep glassware of an oversized coffee table slam Case down on
top of it and slap plastic restraints on his wrists and ankles

The other Policemen begin a destructive search of the townhouse

The PALE MAN looms over Case like the Angel of Death a dark form framed
against
flickering shafts of incendiary light His voice is an icy whisper

PALE MAN
Nice place Mr Case Industrial espionage must be paying well these days

Case speaks through bloody lips

CASE
Lets see your warrant

PALE MAN

(chuckles)

Oh were not arresting you The law books havent quite caught up with your
technology Breaking

into the computer matrix by cerebral projection thats a little tough to
prosecute dont you think

On the other side of the room a Policeman smashes open a false front
bookshelf

revealing an impressive array of customised gear A tiara-like headset rests
on
a bust of Socrates

SENSENET POLICEMAN
Lieutenant

PALE MAN
Thats it gentlemen

The police begin to destroy the gear with the enthusiasm of prohibitionists
ata
moonshine still

CASE
Ive got money

PALE MAN

Not anymore Youve burned at least three multinational corporations Mr
Case

Youre getting a little too good at your craft my friend Thats bad for
business Bad for everybody

The Pale Man withdraws a glittering hypodermic from a silver case

CASE
Whats that

PALE MAN
Your retirement plan

He jams the needle into the artery on cases forearm and drives the plunger
home

Cases body convulses as the mycotoxin surges through his veins
The Pale Man turns to Linda Lee

PALE MAN (CONT)
Hell be hallucinating for oh about fifteen hours

He pats her on the cheek

PALE MAN (CONT)
Whats left after that is all yours

HIGH ANGLE

CAMERA BOOMS DOWN onto the spread eagled Case surrounded by his enemies He
screams as the mycotoxin hits his nervous system like a runaway freight
train

His dilated eyes flash open staring into a hallucinatory hell BOOM DOWN
continues straight through the glistening black hole of his pupil and on into
a

chilling inner void

CHIBA CITY JAPAN
ONE YEAR LATER

INT CHATSUBO BAR

We are hit by a solid wall of ROCK MUSIC and BAR NOISE The Chatsubo is one
of

the roughest dives on the Ginzu and the only place in town where youre
likely

to meet an American or European as an Oriental RATZ a broad-shouldered
leather faced Bartender with an articulated prosthetic arm serves the crush
of

patrons as he casually passes through holograms for Tsing Toa and Kirin Beer

Case sits at a table in the far corner talking to two Japanese businessmen
He

looks the worse for wear rumpled unshaven and ten pounds lighter Its been
a

rough year

He chain smokes through Yeheyuan cigarettes as he speaks to the ancient DR
KIYOTO through his rotund interpreter MR TENSHU A grubby folder containing
CAT

Scan transparencies lies open on the tabletop before them

TENSHU
Dr Kiyoto say scan reveal many secrets You suffer serious damage to nervous
system Someone play bad trick on you

CASE

into the matrix

Tenshu translates and Kiyoto replies

TENSHU

CASE
Everyone says Dr Kiyoto is the best nerve splicer in all the black clinics

TENSHU

Nerve splice very risky Dr Kiyoto now

Dr Kiyoto makes further comment in Japanese

TENSHU (CONT)
He say he admires your bone structure You make beautiful woman We correct
natures mistake

Kiyoto smiles at Case flashing huge synthetic ultra white teeth framed by
horrible grey gums

CASE
(downs his drink
Tell him no thanks I got lousy legs

Case rises and heads for the bar Ratz pours him a shot of Japanese vodka as
he
pulls up a stool

RATZ
Ah Herr Case And how is the artiste tonight

A boozy tattooed hooker looks up from her drink impressed

HOOKER

man

refills
his glass

RATZ

Case lights a cigarette

CASE

Ratz nods Case turns following his gaze

Linda Lee stands in the doorway dressed in French fatigues and sneakers
Theres still a warmth and beauty about her that shines through the hard edge
of

a year of disappointments in Chiba City

Case makes his way through the crowd Hes gentle with her theres still a
love between them

LINDA LEE
Hello Case

CASE
I thought you already left

LINDA LEE

Flights in the morning You should be on it too Theres nothing for us

Case There never was

To Case its an old battle not worth fighting

CASE
Why did you come here tonight Linda

LINDA LEE
People are talking They say the Yakuza has a contract out on you

CASE

LINDA LEE

grams of liquid ketamine It was supposed to be Jo Jos score

CASE
(pauses)
Where did you here that
LINDA LEE

Too many places Youre playing tag wish some kind of death wish Case
(beat)

Im sorry but Im not sticking around for the funeral

She hesitatesthen kisses him on the cheek turns and disappears into the
night

Case takes a last pull on his cigarette then observes his hand His fingers
are

shaking He flicks the butt away

EXT JULIUS DEANE IMPORT-EXPORT

A dingy commercial building wedged between a strip joint and a digital tape
store Case takes the rickety stairway up three steps at a time He bursts
through a door under the worn sign Julius Deane Import-Export

A dark rosewood office crowded with expensive European furniture and stacks
of

white fibreglass shipping modules Several CATS lounge about in the shadows
DEANE an obese but extremely well groomed man sits quietly at his desk just
outside the small circle of light thrown by a brass lamp One of his cats is
perched casually on his shoulder A thick Cuban cigar smoulders between his
stubby fingers

Case storms into the room sending hissing cats scrambling out of the way
CASE

You stupid stupid son of a bitch That was supposed to be a clean score
Youve got me fencing Yakuza goods on Yakuza turf

CU - DEANES HAND

A large white ash tumbles from Deanes cigars His hand remains motionless
ON CASE

As he reacts We hear the soft sound of a cat licking

DOLLY

With Case as he rushes to the desk and flips the lamp shade up onto
DEANES FACE

Illuminated for the first time The cat perched on his shoulder is lapping at
a

crimson knife wound bisecting his windpipe

CASE

Steps back horrified

THE DESK
Deanes right hand is frozen on the blood splattered keyboard of his compact
computer terminal The small screen is scrolling off a single cryptic word
repeated ad infinitum

Wintermute

Wintermute

Wintermute

CASE

Hastily flips the light off and crosses to the window

CASES POV

Two stocky JAPANESE MEN stand just beyond the orange glow of a quartz halogen
street light gazing back up at Case Yakuza They start across the street
heading for the building

CASE

Releases the curtain and runs a hand through his tousled hair

CASE
Shit

He looks back at Julius Deane

CASE (CONT)
Weve been set up old buddy

Case rummages through Deanes coat rack until he finds an old fashioned 38
in

an ancient cracked leather shoulder holster He flips the barrel open
Theres

only one round in the chamber Itll have to do

Case jams the gun in his belt and pushes a button on Deanes desk A section
of

panelled wall pops open revealing a hidden exit He takes a last look at his
former partner

CASE
So long Julie Dont forget to feed the cats

NINSEI STREETS

Case rushes through the Saturday night street crowd past Yakitori stands and
massage parlours

A Japanese ELVIS IMPERSONATOR sends his eerie rendition of Heartbreak Hotel
echoing down the Ninsei Case checks his back

The two Yakuza heavies are searching the crowd half a block away A third
gangster the size of a boxcar joins them

Case backs into the doorway of a surgery parlour as he checks the other
direction
A dangerous looking WOMAN IN BLACK wearing mirror shades is heading towards
Case She reaches inside her black leather jacket and loosens her shoulder
holster as she scans the crowd

Case ducks just past a group of RUSSIAN SAILORS and cuts across the street
just past a MESSENGER on a motorised tricycle

The Yakuza spot him and push their way through the crowd

Case ducks into the garishly decorated doorway of an arcade

INT ARCADE

A deafening cacophony of ARCADE SOUNDS echoes throughout the darkened room as
lifelike holograms do battle under the guidance of customers at gaming
consoles

As Case enters a holographic fireball from Tank War Europa briefly
illuminates

the room

The three Yakuzas burst through the doors and begin to search the room

Case grabs an Armed Guard by the shoulder

CASE
Theres going to be trouble Get your security over here

The guard is suddenly jerked out of Cases grasp from the impact of an azide
slug imploding his chest

Case ducks back as three more SHOTS shatter the side of a console The
GUNFIRE

is lost in the noise of the arcade

Yakuza 1 his gun smoking cautiously circles the aisle

Case crouches in the darkness From just behind the game console he can see
wair of feetslowly approaching He cocks his gun timing the approach
carefullythen springs

THE AISLE

A KID in oversized biker boots drops his popcorn as Case leaps out

CASE

Pulls his shot at the last second firing into the air

YAKUZA 1

Pops up out of the darkness behind him gun blazing

THE KID

Beside Case is blown off his feet shattering a holo projector
CASE

Cuts through the maze of games ducking lead He loses the hit man at the
back
of the arcade then checks the 38empty

A red dot appears on Cases chest He looks up

THE BIG YAKUZA

Looking like a Sumo wrestler stuffed into an ill-fitting suit The laser-site
on

his modified Uzi casts the quavering dot on Cases chest

The Big Yak smiles His gold earring bearing the symbol of the Yakuza
twinkles

eerily in the darkness

The kisses his thumb and makes the ritual gesture of death to Case

LOW ANGLE - SLO MO

As another holographic blast erupts from Tank War Europa the WOMAN IN BLACK
leaps through the ghostly atomic fire launching herself straight at the Big

Yakuza

She executes an amazing flying kick snapping her body around to connect with
the Yakuzas jaw He goes down like a felled Sequoia

Yakuza 3 appears fining at the Woman in Black Case tackles him They
struggle

for control of his gun The crowd finally reacts to the real violence in the
midst of their illusionary battles

The Big Yakuza begins to rise spitting out teeth and pissed off

Case spots him swings 3s gun hand around and squeezes the trigger

The Big Yakuza takes a hit in the heart and crumbles

Still gripping 3s hand Case savagely elbows him in the face Once Twice
Three times He goes down

Suddenly machine pistol fire strafes the console behind Case The monitor
explodes with a hail of glass shards

x (Something to do with firing his machine pistol)

Case runs for all hes worth heading for a window across the room He barrel
rolls straight through glass and neon as a fusillade of bullets explode
around

him

EXT STREET

Case hits the cement and rolls knocking over a couple of leather clad
HOOKERS
in the process He disappears into the crowd as the Hookers scream expletives
at
him

INT CHATSUBO BAR

The doors blow open as JO JO BAO the twenty-five year old Yakuza Lieutenant
of

Chiba City enters escorted by four heavily armed BODYGUARDS The cold
expressionless mask of Baos face suggests the brutality required to climb so
far in the Yakuza ranks at such an early age His startling aqua blue eyes
are

an obvious affectation from the black clinic tanks

As the entourage cuts its way across the crowded floor a ripple of tension
spreads throughout the room

Ratz casts a wary glance to his sideman FRITZ

Fritz gently lifts a wire bore scattergun from its resting place out of sight
under the bar

Ratz shakes his head no and motions for Fritz to stand by
Jo Jo sits down before Ratz flanked by his men

RATZ
Arigatou Bao-san Rare to see you out this time of night

Baos English is excellent

JO JO BAO
Im afraid I could not sleep Worry makes me restless

RATZ
Is that so

JO JO BAO
Yes Im worried for your friend The man they call Case

Ratz looks from one bodyguards icy stare to the other

RATZ
Not my friend My customer

JO JO BAO
Of course Forgive me

Bao extends his pinky finger which is encased in a decorative gold sleeve
With

a twist he disengages the sleeve revealing that his finger has been
amputated

at the knuckle Bao casually taps a line of yellow powder out of his
fingervial

onto the bar

JO JO BAO (CONT)
Your customerCase is a difficult man to find when he wants to be

Bao applies a match to the powder which ignites like a fuse He then
expertly
inhales the resulting curl of dirty yellow smoke then offers Ratz a pull

RATZ
AhNo thanks I can try to get in touch with him for you Cant promise
anything you understand

JO JO BAO
I would greatly appreciate this You see there is a small matter that must be
settled between Case and I

One of Baos bodyguards suddenly lashes out with a wickedly curved dagger
burying it in the counter top

CU THE DAGGER

The gleaming blade had pinned a human ear to the worn wood By the elaborate
gold earring we recognise that this once belonged to the Big Yakuza in the
arcade

EXT CHEAP HOTEL - NIGHT

Camera suddenly BOOMS UP to the rooftop of a shabby ten story office
building

Up here in some of the last available space in the crowded city a cheap
hotel

has been erected out of prefab fibreglass coffins racked in a framework of
industrial scaffolding and catwalks A weakly flickering neon sign offers the
words CHEAP HOTEL under a cluster of Japanese ideograms

INT CHEAP HOTEL

Linda Lee has just finished packing a small suitcase in the cramped quarters
of

the white fibreglass module The rooms moulded to maximise the efficiency of
the

living space concave area for microwave and cooler convex area for a
temperfoam bed slab for computer terminal and telephone

Linda peels off a photograph taped to the wall of her and Case in better
days

mugging for the camera during a break in a game of Jai Alai She decides to
leave it for him

The telephone rings As Linda picks it up the computer screen is illuminated
with a CU of Ratz

LINDA LEE
Hello

INTERCUT CHATSUBO BAR

Ratz speaks into a grimy mobile phone before a wall mounted lens In the BG
we
see his small audience of Yakuza heavies

RATZ
Is Case there

LINDA
No Whos this

RATZ
A friend I have a very important message Are you listening

LINDA
Yes but I

RATZ
Jo Jo Bao says Case should bring the goods the Yakitori Stand at the arena in
one hour Jo Jo gets the goods or Case gets orchids Hell understand

There is a click as the phone disconnects The screen goes blank

Linda Lee looks back at the photograph of the man she used to love She snaps
her suitcase shut and starts for the door But she stops short and finally
makes a decision

Linda crosses to the cooler and rummages about inside She discovers a 9mm
automatic hidden by a row of beer bottles Searching further she finds a
plastic container behind the ice cube trays Inside packed in dry ice is a
glass tube filled with an amber fluid Ketamine

Linda stops and considers the gravity of what she is about to do She closes
the
container and stuffs it into her canvas shoulder bag

EXT BULLET TRAIN PLATFORM - NIGHT

The sleek train is a blur of motion as it clears frame revealing Case
exhausted and dishevelled from his run in with the Yakuza He checks his
surroundings warily then exits the platform As he approaches the dingy
stairway his attention is drawn to a holographic travel advert floating
overhead

CLOSER - HOLOGRAM

It displays a beautiful cylindrical satellite hanging in space like a
twinkling

childs toy The word FREESIDE pulses beneath the image in capital letters
that

mimic printed Japanese followed by the copy line Why wait

A crack of lightning briefly illuminates a night sky choked with storm
clouds A
light rain begins to fall Case moves on

EXT CHEAP HOTEL
Case turns his collar up against the rain as he checks his lock for signs of
a
break-in He slots a key card and the portal pops open

INT CHEAP HOTEL

Slipping through the small entry case shrugs off his wet jacket and reaches
for
the lights

OFFSCREEN VOICE
Hold it

Case turns to find himself looking down the four barrelled muzzle of a
Fletcher

a lethal looking hand gun that shoots dart cartridges ranging from
tranquillisers to micro-explosives

The Woman In Black sits at the far end of the coffin training the Fletcher on
Case with a rock steady hand The guns pepper box muzzle rotates once
clicking

a barrel in place

WOMAN
No lights I can see just fine the way I am thanks

CU THE WOMAN

Her mirror shades are actually surgically inset silver lenses that cover her

eye
sockets Her fine features and smooth pale skin are framed by a rough shag of
jet black hair Theres a cold beauty about her marred by a street tough
edge

WOMAN

Now close the door

WOMANS POV

Her lenses provide light boosters enhancing the scene in a pale green hue
as

Case closes the portal

CASE
That was you at the arcade

WOMAN

I just wanted to put the Big Yak down not kill him Ive got enough problems
without Yak heat

ANOTHER ANGLE

The rooms only light source is the dim glow of the computer monitor

RK RK Kk KK KK RK KK KK KKK

Unfortunately the next page is missing from the bootleg I can establish
though that Case learns that Armitage has a job for him and that the Woman
In

Black is in fact Molly The best pointer for the scenes may in fact be the
novel

RK RK Kk KK KK RK KK KK KKK

MOLLY
His names Armitage Hes very anxious to meet you

CASE
Why should I want to meet him

MOLLY

Because youve exceeded your shelf life Case Word on the street is youre
dead man walking Nice time for an employment opportunity Travel to exotic
locales

CASE
Whats my end

MOLLY
You want to hear the pitch you gotta meet the man

Case considers this for a beat then reaches for his jacket

CASE
This better be good

Molly holsters her gun and rises
Case now notices Lindas suitcase lying by the temperfoam slab with a note
on

top of it He scans the note adrenalin surges through his body

MOLLY
What is it

CASE
a friend of mines gonna get herself killed I need my clip

MOLLY
Sorry Thats not gonna happen

CASE
Then fuck you Im gone

Case reaches for the door
The fletcher is instantly in Mollys hand and firing

Three blue steel darts puncture the fibreglass portal and stand
quivering inches from Cases hand

Case turns and glares at Molly She considers the situation

MOLLY (CONT)
(holsters gun)
Alright We check your friend out first But I want you to
remember something

Molly snaps her hand open palms up With a barely audible click ten double
edged scalpel blades slide from their housings beneath her black lacquered
nails Surgical implants

MOLLY
You mess with me youll be playing Jai Alai with Jesus

An inflated dome behind a portside warehouse taut grey fabric reinforced
with a

net of thin steel cables The roar of the crowd briefly rises above the night
sounds of Chiba City

INT ARENA

Linda Lee makes her way across a crowded transom as the predominantly
Japanese

CROWD exchange fistfuls of new yen placing their bets She pauses to ask an

Their

combat style combines street fighting fencing and kickboxing

The dimly lit outer hall is lined with massive cement pylons that anchor the

drifting cigarette smoke and light

Black coffee poured into a china cup
INT HOTEL ROOM - DAY

Case sits in an oversized chair framed against a large picture window in a
luxurious suite Outside a slate grey sky hangs over the jumble of Chiba
City A

light rain patters against the glass

Case looks wasted washed out His arm is supported by a web-like nylon
sling
He sips his coffee in silence

Molly pours a cup for her employer

ARMITAGE is a powerfully built man in his early forties His dark robe frames
a

broad muscular chest and a flat stomach His white blonde hair is close
cropped

in an almost military style

ARMITAGE
Are you sure youre up to this Mr Case We could reconvene tomorrow

CASE

Youve got an expensive razor girl on me for a reason Id like to hear what
it

is

ARMITAGE
Very well

Armitage slots a laser disc the size of a quarter into a remote control The
picture window behind Case is instantly transformed into a wall sized screen
displaying news footage of chaos in the London stock market

ARMITAGE (CONT)

What youre seeing here is the London stock market crash of last September
This

was the first in a series of setbacks for the international banking
community

Molly pours herself some coffee and sits down near Case Her Fletcher hangs
loosely on her side in a black nylon shoulder holster
Armitage switches the scene to a space shuttle manufacturing plant

ARMITAGE (CONT)
The collapse of Aerospace International

He switches to a corporate conference room where a hearing is in progress
ARMITAGE (CONT)
The corporate plundering of Yeshoto Industries At first these seemed like

unrelated incidents but a pattern is emerging that suggests otherwise

CASE
What does this have to do with me

ARMITAGE

(turns off screen)

Our analysis of the London stock crash suggest that it was manipulated from
within the international computer matrix Cyberspace Mr Case A realm I
believe youre familiar with

CASE
(shrugs)
Put the SenseNet Police on it The matrix is their turf

ARMITAGE

SenseNets corporately financed Too corrupt to be trusted You of all
people

should know that

Armitage sits down across from Case

ARMITAGE (CONT)

If someone is infiltrating the matrix on a global scale no political or
economic

system is safe Im assembling a team of specialists Mr Case We need a man
who can enter the matrix and trace this saboteur

CASE
My days of punching deck are over For you or anybody else

ARMITAGE
What would you say if I told you we could correct your neural damage

CASE
Id say you were full of shit

Armitage nods

CASE (CONT)
Then Id ask you what your terms are

ARMITAGE

First lets get something straight We ran a psych construct on you that
lists

self destruction as your favourite pastime If you want to kill yourself Mr
Case theres much more entertaining ways than working for me

CASE

Its the people close to me that tend to die and I get the feeling you and
I

are going to be real buddies

(beat)

Terms

ARMITAGE
Well match your rate just prior to your accident One half in advance

CASE
Whos running the show Armitage This a government sting

ARMITAGE
Questions make me nervous Part of our arrangement will be that you dont ask
too many

Armitage rises

ARMITAGE (CONT)
One more thing Mr Case Be prepared to travel light

MOLLY
Your girl Linda Lee Youve been calling her name

She wrings out a wet cloth Applies it to his forehead

MOLLY (CONT)
She must have really loved you

Case gazes into the darkness His voice is a weak whisper

It got her killed

Molly straightens up his covers

karate pads part uneven parallel bars She flies through her routine with
animal grace and the focused discipline of a professional athlete

The rig stands in the middle of a sparsely furnished high ceilinged loft
Shafts
of soft morning light are filtered through a row of dusty windows

Hes lying on a futon in the middle of the worn wooden floor He rises
pulling a

sheet around his naked shoulders but hes stopped cold as a splitting
headache hits home

Hey youre not supposed to be up

Molly guides Case to a stool at the kitchen counter He looks around the

red-rimmed eyes adjusting to the light

How long have I been out

MOLLY
Almost two days

Case gazes down at the narrow bandages across his main arteries

CASE
I gotta know did it work

MOLLY
Well find out soon enough If you dont pull the splices out

Case snaps the cap off a bottle of bourbon and pours a drink

CASE
How soon is soon enough

MOLLY
Couple of days Theyll examine you

Case slugs down the bourbon

Thats cute Very fucking cute What else did this guy do to me when he had
me

I dont call this fun pal Youre playing God with my body

ARMITAGE

Youre a substance abuser Case Your pancreas was shot Wouldnt have lasted
out the year We did you a favour and liberated you from a dangerous
dependency

in the bargain

Thanks but I was enjoying that dependency

ARMITAGE
Good because youve got a new one
Armitage sets the boxes down in a corner with several others

I inject you with the antitoxin

CASE

Whyd you do it Armitage

ARMITAGE

The disturbance in cyberspace Its an AI

CASE

(bitter chuckle)

Right And no one would take on an AI If they had a choice
MOLLY

Whats an AI

ARMITAGE

An Artificial Intelligence A computer system thats developed the capacity
for

sentient thought Theyre dangerous and totally unpredictable

CASE
First sign of free will SenseNet usually slags em

ARMITAGE

This ones different No one can trace it Its out there somewhere in the
matrix and its growing stronger infecting other computer systems like a
virus

Anything rated higher than a PCs got a hard-wired suicide switch Itll
self-

Ive heard about rogue AIs but theres only one guy who actually went up
against one

Right Best cowboy that ever punched deck The old man taught me most of what
I

know

Ive arranged for him to work with us

CASE
Thats gonna be tough because Dixie McCoys dead The AI flatlined him

ARMITAGE

I know

You ever work with ghosts Case

CASE
What are you talking about

ARMITAGE
SenseNet taped a full spectrum personality construct on McCoy six months
before

his death Everything Dixie was -- everything Dixie still knows exists as a
digitised construct

Youll be ready for a trial run in two days If your splices hold youll use
McCoy to trace the AIs coordinates

Then we rendezvous with the final member of our team For now thats all you
need to know

Case lies sleeplessly staring at the mysterious grouping of boxes that
Armitage
has left lying on the moonlit floor He rises

As Case unstacks the boxes he discovers a glossy pamphlet advertising the
luxury
satellite Freeside with the familiar copyline Freeside Why wait

Beneath it is an 8x10 fashionably dressed cabaret artist It bears the
heading

The Holographic Cabaret of Peter Riviera Ghostly images of skulls and
jewels

dance about Riviera

Case sets the papers aside and runs his hand over the smooth surface of a box
bearing cryptic instructions in Japanese He tears it open and brushes back
the

clear plastic packing bubbles

He gently lifts a beautiful Ono-Sendai Cyberspace 7 computer deck out of the
box

and sets it in a square of dusty moonlight thrown across the worn wooden
floor

Its a more compact version of the jerry-rigged deck in Cases old townhouse
He

runs his hands over the smooth lines of the two tiered keyboard the sleek
joystick

cotton body stocking Her Fletcher hangs from her shoulder in its open
harness

CASE
On a good run yeah

MOLLY

When I was fifteen SenseNet iced my old mans credit record over some
computer

destroyed him I had to hustle arcade games for chump change Dixie McCoy
found

me figured I was a natural He taught me the wires for a piece of the

Shhh

Case eases back her cowl revealing only her glistening red lips

CASE (CONT)
Tastes like you

They kiss again passionately Hungrily
She wraps her ghostly arms around him

Cases fingertips disappear as he slowly pulls down a zipper on her side The
smooth skin of her delicately muscled leg appears as if by magic

Case gently pulls Mollys hood back and runs his hands through her tousled
jet
black hair kissing her He unfastens her suit

The image is surreal as their embrace grows more and more passionate A man
making love to a woman of sensuous parts A leg An arm A breast
floating

in the shadowy night

Do you think you know how to love Case

To really love

Case looks down into her eyes He has no answer for her

immense cube of white light Simple and ominous

light but even at this range it shows none of the entry points common to the

other constructs

Case quickly types out LOG A27 A two dimensional square appears that
duplicates a section of the ice pattern

A stippled grey circle suddenly forms on the face of the cube like a time
lapse mould culture

light like twin cursors burning in the darkness

JULIUSWINTERMUTE
Yes Yes Thats quite correct

Case cocks the gun

CASE

JULIUSWINTERMUTE

Theres no call for violence Ive simply accessed your memory for a
spokesperson You use that gun and it will only create another inconvenient
interruption You see youve been avoiding me Case

turned

inside out a yawning tube of colossal proportions slowly rotating in the
blackness of space Its interior is lined with an impossible 360 degree

a function of the tubes slow rotation

You see the couple up in the balcony

Case and Molly look up at an ancient man in a wheelchair sitting with a
beautiful aristocratic looking young WOMAN We recognise the man Lord
Frederick

Tessier as one of the three SenseNet Chairmen The young women speaks
softly

to him as she cuts his meat and feeds it to him A diabolical figure in the
traditional black garb of a Ninja Warrior stands guard over them from a
respectable distance
ARMITAGE (CONT)

Thats Lord Frederick Tessier Owns most of Freeside Wintermutes mainframe
is

centred in the Royal Familys villa

CASE
Hes a SenseNet Chairman Why would he launch an AI

ARMITAGE

Good question He may not have intended to The girl in question is Lady
3Jane

Shes very important to us The third clone of Lady Jane Tessier

proud to present the holographic cabaret of Mr Peter Riviera

Tonights illusions are created strictly by Mr Rivieras uniquely enhanced
mental abilities

Exotic MID EASTERN MUSIC begins as the glimmer of tiny lights appear across
the

darkened stage growing in brightness until they become a miniature star
field complete with swirling nebula

Suddenly all the lights converge to a central point forming a new image a
chromium rose glittering in the darkness

A finger spot hits the rose as a hand plucks it out of mid air
PETER RIVIERA pins the magical rose to his lapel Smooth as silk cool as
ice

Riviera is a pony tailed dandy in a trim vanilla tuxedo He steps into the
spotlight and takes a bow as the audience applauds

RIVIERA

Good evening ladies and gentlemen I would like to perform a new work for
you

tonight An improvisation I shall call The Doll

Riviera takes the holographic flower from his lapel and holds it up towards
the
balcony

RIVIERA (CONT)

I wish to dedicate its premiere to Lady 3Jane Tessier Freesides most
beautiful

flower

As he tosses her the flower it transforms into a BIRD with multi-hued
metallic

feathers 3Jane watches in delight as it flies straight up and lands on her
arm

Lord Tessier grabs at the bird but it disappears in twinkling motes of
light

Molly whispers to Case

MOLLY
He projects with neural implants

CASE
Thats risky gear It can drive you schizo

For Peter thats a short trip

Riviera looks out across the darkened room directly at Molly

RIVIERA (CONT)
And if I may a further dedication to one other lady a very special guest
tonight

peeled walls Bare mattress on a wrought iron frame A holo of Riviera
awakes

But when I awoke she remained Sand and clay

The simulcrum embraces Riviera cold coarse arms of clay caressing his body

Perhaps it was she that dreamed of me Come dawn it was I who would cease to
be

They kiss passionately and whenever his hands run across her svelte body
she

becomes real Clay to flesh

her

back onto the bed

down her spine With each swipe of her claws sand flows from Rivieras
wound

He coaxes an equally fanciful SCORPION up his forearm until it sinks its
stinger
into his artery Riviera sighs The GIRL giggles

MOLLY
Do you always make a floorshow out of it

Riviera looks up to find Molly standing in the open doorway of his dressing
room The snake encircling his arm has become surgical tubing and the
scorpion a

hypodermic Riviera finishes shooting up and withdraws the needle

Molly jams the Fletcher in his ribs

She pulls a silver plated Derringer from Rivieras sash and tosses it onto

the
couch Armitage picks it up in a handkerchief

dangerous

Melody rises but Molly blocks her path

little more of that scorpions sting Isnt that right Peter

Riviera brushes a trickle of blood from the corner of his mouth
Armitage tosses a microcassette down on the coffee table

Riviera rises and crosses to his wet bar

RIVIERA
Its an attractive offer Mr Armitage but theres only one problem

He presses a button on the side of his telephone

RIVIERA (CONT)

You see Im beginning to enjoy living in exile The Tessiers have taken me
to

their bosom so to speak Ive become a favourite of the court Protected in
fact from people like you

A Royal Guardsmen now enters with a streamlined Uzi held at arms

ROYAL GUARDSMAN
Is there a problem Mr Riviera

RIVIERA
Captain these people are boring me Perhaps you can escort them out

ROYAL GUARDSMAN
Gentlemen if you will follow me

As Armitage rises he pulls out Rivieras Derringer still wrapped in his
handkerchief and fires a single shot directly between the Captains eyes
His

head snaps back as hes slammed into the wall by the impact

Molly and Case watch in shock as the Guardsmans body slides to the floor
Armitage turns to Riviera holding out the smoking gun in the handkerchief
ARMITAGE

Your gun your prints The Tessiers might overlook a little child molesting
but

murders bad PR Mr Riviera I suggest to reconsider my offer

RIVIERA

Armitage suddenly aims the gun at Riviera as he cocks the hammer his voice
shaking with anger

Armitage walks to the far end of the hologram

ARMITAGE (CONT)

The Villa Straylight Home of the Royal Family and the mainframe of the

entity we know as Wintermute If we can get Molly in she can access the
mainframe to cripple Mutes defences the Case can destroy it in Cyberspace

Hows the villas security

ARMITAGE

Excellent but thats where Peter come in 3Jane is having a dinner party
tomorrow night Peter will simply escort Molly to the villa Once shes in
Case will guide her to the mainframe in link mode

CASE
What about the mainframes access code

RIVIERA
3Janes the only person beside Tessier that knows the code

ARMITAGE
Then youll have to persuade her to tell it to you

RIVIERA
And how do you suggest I do that

Armitage tosses down Rivieras microcassette and Derringer still wrapped in
the
handkerchief

ARMITAGE

Youre a resourceful man Peter It should be easier to outwit a young sex
clone

than the combined police forces here and on Earth

Armitage freezes as a dozen BLACK WIDOW SPIDERS suddenly appear crawling up

arms He frantically tries to brush them away but stops himself and glares
at

Dixie flashes images from Armitages files before Case

DIXIE (CONT)

He was an MP in Bangkok back in 21 Caught some shrapnel in the cerebral
cortex and wound up living off a machine in a vegetable ward in Berne Then
last September surprise surprise he just seemed to disappear

CASE
Wintermute could have infiltrated that machine Reprogrammed him

DIXIE
Its possible The guy was a blank slate

CASE
So it does business through a brain dead marine and runs the stock market for
funding That means Wintermute hired us to fry itself It doesnt make sense

DIXIE
Could be suicidal Its not easy to kill yourself with all those hard wired
defence programs

No Its gotta be more than that That hard wiring also keeps it from getting
too smart Too powerful

three ancient RASTAFARIANS float in zero gravity Their legs crossed in
lotus

position

The entire hull of the room is covered in a lurid mural of a rainbow jungle
The
air is thick with resinous smoke

The chief elder looks up as Molly and Case glide forward gripping the
archway
for support His deep voice echoes eerily in the perfectly round chamber

CHIEF ELDER
Steppin razor Like unto a whippin stick

He passes a smoking pipe and lets it drift in Zero-Gs to Elder 1

ELDER 1
That is story we have sister A religion story Were glad youve come

MOLLY

CHIEF ELDER

Armitage stops dead in his tracks and stares at Case

Armitages face goes absolutely blank then

ARMITAGE
Youve got your orders

Armitage slowly levels his gun at Case
Maelcom rises to his feet spring steel muscles coiled to strike
Case chooses each word carefully

CASE (CONT)

Armitage stares at Case with mad empty eyes

CASE (CONT)
You cant win

Long beat Armitage whispers to Case

ARMITAGE
But there is no antitoxin

Armitages stony visage cracks with an eerie grin then dark LAUGHTER
begins

to bubble up from somewhere inside of him Bad crazy laughter

Case watches him in disbelief

Armitage collapses back into a chair still holding a 45

ARMITAGE (CONT)
But then again there is no poison

Armitage again breaks into gales of laughter

Case looks down at his arms The streaks of discolouration running along his
arteries are even more pronounced He grabs Armitage by the lapels

CASE
Whats inside me you son of a bitch

Armitages hand shoots out jamming his 45 into Cases chest Suddenly hes
cold

as ice He glances at his watch

ARMITAGE
You find out in exactly two hours and forty-five minutes

CASE
I find out now

Armitage cocks the gun Beat

Molly reacts instinctively sidestepping 3Jane as she disarms her 3Janes

Molly reaches an elegant cage-style elevator and presses the call button
An armed guardsman quickly approaches

GUARDSMAN

MOLLY

The elevator arrives and the cage smoothly opens

GUARDSMAN
Its back through the dining hall and to your left Madam

MOLLY
Thank you so much

As Molly turns then drives the first two knuckles of her right hand into the
guardsmans solar plexus Hes slammed back into the elevator gasping for
breath fumbles for his gun

Mollys a blur of motion as she knocks the gun from his hand with a flying
kick
and drops him with two lightning like karate blows
She pulls his body into the elevator and touches CLOSE DOOR and STOP on the

in

Duprey staggers back stunned by the blow then grabs the shock stave from

crisscrossing along the entire length of the hall

machine

A Royal Guardsman glides around the corner on a pulpit heading straight
for

Molly looks back up the laser rigged hall and takes a deep breath

Molly runs full speed up the hall as silently as a cat then tumbles like an
expert gymnast flipping over and through the crisscrossing sensor beams with
incredible precision

She lands near the door into its shadowed archway just as the pulpit passes

pieces locked in their final checkmate The embers of a dying fire glow in a
stone hearth beneath him

carefully follow the movement of the humans below

Molly tries to rise but Hideo is on her like a hurricane raining vicious
blows
on her weakened body with the whirling staff

Mollys blades flash once ripping the black cloth from Hideos face

Haunted by the image of his own death

to

a rock wall by a steel shaft imbedded in his throat

Suddenly the silence is shattered by a piercing WHISTLE A basalt arrow
streaks

out of the darkness and skewers Aerol through the throat

Hes pinned to the wall next to his own fading hologram horrific twin

Wheels about as he spots Riviera running through the shadows He fires both
barrels

Is slammed back against the wall by the deadly impact

Jams another round into the chamber as he rushes to his kill He trains the
weapon on Rivieras lifeless form but it begins to fade another

just below Maelcoms collarbone He collapses to his knees

firing

direction

the

With a shrill WHISTLE a basalt arrow tears the gun from Cases grasp

Stands atop a half-fallen archway only yards from Case He shows no emotion

as
he notches a final arrow and hops down for the coup de grace

Suddenly an arc of flame shoots out of the darkness raking Hideo across
his

Still pinned to the wall Fires his torch with a dying effort The weapon

tumbles from his hand as his body finally goes slack

Scrambles in the darkness for his gun

Rises notching the last two arrows in his bow as if nothing had happened He
cocks his head listening

Freezes Hoping he hasnt given away his position

Rolls but the shafts rake across his ribs and pin his leather jacket to the
floor trapping him

Draws his gleaming Samurai sword from his back sling and springs forward

Pulls free of his coat sleeves just as Hideos sword lashes out slicing the
jacket in half

Pauses Listening

Sees a black and yellow striped power box attached to the wall Just like
the

one in the dining hall He holds his breath as he silently eases back toward

Detects motion He slowly closes in brandishing his sword as he weaves back

forth like a cobra ready to strike

Lunges his blade a streak of lightning

The mainframes overloaded circuitry rains sparks all around them

THE MAINFRAME MONITOR

The screen is alive with streaks of crackling power swirling around the image
of
a chromium sphere

Case leans on the control pedestal for support as he cries out to the
computer
entity before him

CASE
Wintermute
The screens all around the chamber print out

Wintermute is dead

As Case and Maelcom watch in awe the sphere rotates on its axis revealing
a
buddha-like face of glistening silver Mollys face but more than Molly
A

Neuromancer unlike anything calculated by Wintermute

CASE
(whispers)
Molly

For one brief moment the eyes meet A heartbreaking Mona Lisa smile graces
Mollys lips then her chromium eye lids rise for the first time Beautiful
jade green eyes gaze lovingly into Cases

Suddenly the monitor explodes as the entire mainframe shorts out bursting
into

flame

The floor again begins to rise lifting Case and Maelcom out of the scene of
spreading destruction

INT SENSENET - MONITORING ROOM - EARTH

Terminals explode as the systems overload Personnel run for their lives
INT STRAYLIGHT DINING HALL

Electrical systems are shorting out overhead as oily smoke pours out of the
ventilation system Case helps Maelcom past the wreck of the flying pulpit
just

as two guards enter the room and open fire Case wheels about and guns them

down

The floor shakes with the WHUMP of a huge explosion somewhere deep in
Straylight

EXT VILLA STRAYLIGHT

The entire structure is catching fire Portions of the villa are rocked by
internal explosions The air taxi rises out of the billowing smoke and flies
straight out of Freeside

EXT FREESIDE

The air taxi shouts out of the slowly rotating tube into the black void of
space In the distance is the blue marbled sphere of EARTH

INT AIR TAXI
Case tends to Maelcoms wounds with the ships med kit as Freeside drops away

in
the distance
CASE
Do we have enough fuel to make it back to Earth

MAELCOM
Dont know mon This is a jumpship Not meant for transport

CASE
Were dead men if we go back there Maelcom Theyll hunt us down

The on board computer suddenly CRACKLES to life Navigational charts and
trajectories appear

MAELCOM (CONT)
What is it

Case inspects the screen slowly realising its significance
CASE

Trajectory coordinates and a fuel ratio

(turns to Maelcom)

If we re-enter over Mexico we just might make it

MAELCOM
Jah guides us

CASE
Maybe so

Case looks back down at the monitor

CASE (CONT)
But Mollys taking us home

CU THE SCREEN

The softly glowing words remain

To love and be loved is everything

CASE

Presses his hand to the cool glass of the screen The first tear rolls down
his

cheek

EXT SPACE - EARTH

The tiny ships rocket kick in as it sets its course for home

THE END
