Two couples sit at a table picking at dessert JOHN and
LARA BRENNAN on one side MICK and ERIT on the other JOHN
is attractive in a worn kind of way but has the eyes of a
id with a discipline problem You have to really know him
to understand if he is mocking you or agreeing with you He
is a master of irony and has a true enjoyment of the absurd
LARA looks beautiful even in her wrinkled suit She appears
to have had a hard day at the office Shes been drinking
at dinner it hasnt eased her nerves Johns good-looking
brother MICK boasts his blue collar roots and a gorgeous
if slightly trashy girlfriend ERIT who isnt ashamed of
her body or sharing her opinions JOHN and MICK are laughing
Lara puts cash on the tray beside Micks credit card

LARA
You know what If you were smart
you would stop talking right now

ERIT
Sue me I just know that women should
never work for women
John laughs and applauds Mick buries his head

LARA
How can you say that

ERIT
Theyre always threatened Especially
if youre beautiful and theyre not

LARA
Erit you are so full of shit

ERIT
So your boss isnt threatened by
you

LARA

Because shes a bitch --
(as John and Mick laugh)

your little sexual innuendo

ERIT

away

calm how are you supposed to do that

stops him short by kissing him passionately His hands slip

under her blouse she tugs at his sweater

JOHN (CONTD)
