MY PRINCE

(c) Copyright 2016
FADE IN
INT LEAH’S HOUSE - LEAH’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

A small space with just enough room for a bed and a
wardrobe to fit

A reading lamp clipped to the bed is the only source of
light as CATHY (40s) reads LEAH a bedtime story

CATHY
And the princess and her new prince
lived happily ever after

Cathy closes the tattered book puts it down on the floor
beside the bed

The cover is titled The Princess and the Frog

LEAH
One more time Mommy

CATHY
Not tonight Leah Tomorrow is such
a special day for you You remember
what it is

Leah grins from ear to ear nods

CATHY
Such a big girl now School is
going to be so much fun

Leah’s big toothy grin slowly fades She now looks nervous

CATHY
What’s the matter honey

LEAH
Will people like me

CATHY
Of course they will You’re the
sweetest most perfect little girl

LEAH
Promise

CATHY
I promise And if you ever have any
little problem me and Daddy are
right here for you OK

Leah’s big grin returns
LEAH
OK

Cathy gets up off the bed strokes her fingers through
Leah’s hair

CATHY
Now get some sleep Princess

Leah closes her eyes as tight as she can
Cathy kisses her forehead and leaves the room
INT LEAH’S HOUSE - LEAH’S BEDROOM —- DAY
SUPER 12 YEARS LATER

The room somehow looks smaller More items are now crammed
in A typical teenage girl’s bedroom A small one

LEAH (now 17) brushes her long hair in front of a mirror
that’s stuck to the door of her wardrobe

She picks up a pair of glasses from her bed puts them on
They sit crooked

She takes them off fiddles with the arms and puts them on
again Better slightly

She rummages through a pile of clothes on the bed After a
few seconds of searching she lets out an angry grunt

She grabs a backpack and leaves the room
INT LEAH’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

CATHY (now 50s)wearing a pink cardigan lounges in an old
armchair asleep A bottle of vodka on her lap

Leah walks into the room sees her Mom

She rolls her eyes and takes the bottle from her lap

LEAH
Mom
Nothing
LEAH
(louder )
Mom

Cathy’s eyes shoot open
CATHY
Don’t bring that slut in here

Leah stares down at her

CATHY
Leah Is your Dad here

LEAH
Just me Mom Him and that slut
haven’t been here in years

CATHY
Don’t say that

LEAH
Your words

Cathy groans tries to get comfortable again
LEAH
And how many times have I told you
not to take my clothes
Cathy grabs at the cardigan begins to take it off

CATHY
Sorry it was cold

LEAH
Keep it

Leah leaves the room the sound of the front door slamming
soon after

INT SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY

Leah stands at an open locker she stuffs books into her
backpack and closes the door

As it closes a MASKED GIRL jumps at Leah
Leah jumps back against her locker frightened

She sees a group of GIRLS standing behind the masked girl
They laugh hysterically

The masked girl peels off the mask It’s JULIE She
breaks into laughter too

JULIE
Halloween ball on Friday You
going
Leah gathers herself opens her mouth to speak

JULIE
Of course not It’s fancy dress and
to buy a costume you need money
And you and your drunk mother got
no money

The girls laugh again
JULIE
Also you need a date No boy would
be seen dead with you

Julie brushes her fingers through Leah’s messy hair

JULIE
Really Leah that’s gross

Julie and the girls turn laugh and walk away

They walk to a group of BOYS who look at Leah laugh and
walk with the girls

Leah balls her hand into a fist and hits the locker
INT LEAH’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

Cathy sits on the armchair watching a gameshow and sips on
a drink

The sound of the front door as it opens and slams shut
Leah storms in

LEAH
Why do you do this to me What have
I done to you

A look of total confusion washes over Cathy’s face

CATHY
What

LEAH
Why can’t we be normal All I want
is for people to like me for boys
to like me You sit here all day
drunk It’s been years Dad’s gone
Get over it
CATHY
I don’t need this right now Leah

Leah stares down at Cathy with eyes now full of disgust

LEAH
No wonder he left you

Leah storms out of the room

INT LEAHS HOUSE - LEAH’S BEDROOM -—- MOMENTS LATER

Leah slams the door closed behind her slides down on to her
honkers with the heels of her palms pressed against her
eyes

She takes her hands away her eyes now raw red

Under the bed she spots the old copy of The Princess and
the Frog

She reaches for it picks it up and rubs the old cover
CATHY (VO)
And the princess and her new prince
lived happily ever after
Leah puts the book down and leaves
EXT PARK — DAY
Nicely kept Autumn leaves litter the grass
Leah sits on a bench looking out over a pond
She gets up walks to the water
She walks along the bank until she spots it

A frog sits in the tall grass beside the water

Leah walks carefully to it waits and then pounces catches
it in her two hands

She brings the frog close to her face

LEAH
Will you be my prince

The frog squirms but Leah holds it steady and plants a kiss
on its mouth

The frog’s squirms intensify Leah eventually releases it
It hops away further into the long grass
Leah stares as it disappears

LEAH
Nope didn’t think so

INT LEAH’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Empty and dark

The sound of the front door as it opens and slams shut

Leah enters the room looks toward the armchair Puzzled

LEAH
(calling)
Mom
She walks into the
HALLWAY
And looks around
LEAH

Mom
She heads to the
KITCHEN
And flicks a switch on the wall
The light comes on she sees a note on the fridge
INSERT NOTE
Gone out Eat whatever
BACK TO SCENE
Leah rolls her eyes opens the fridge
A loud knock comes from the front door
Leah looks in that direction pauses
Another loud knock

She returns to the
HALLWAY

And slowly walks to the door

She opens it Nobody there

She looks left and right Nothing

She closes the door turns toward the kitchen

In the doorway facing her stands a six foot man - of
sorts He has a completely bald scalp a huge lump on his
right shoulder and his huge throat bulges in and out when he
breathes He stands naked in front of Leah This is FROG
MAN

Leah unleashes an earth shattering scream and opens the
front door

Before she can escape Frog Man leaps at her pushes her to
the floor and closes the door

Leah jumps to her feet runs up the stairs
LEAH’S BEDROOM

Leah slams the door behind her

She stands with her back to it in dead silence

Seconds later a loud CROAK sound comes from outside the
room

Leah winces at the sound

Another loud CROAK

A heavy BANG against the door rocks Leah

Another one knocks her to the floor

The door creeps open a large green hand pushes it open
It opens fully Frog Man looms over Leah

She tracks back up onto her bed

LEAH
Please no

Frog Man releases a loud deep CROAK as his throat bulges

His thin tongue flies out across the room smacks Leah on
the cheek and slithers back into his mouth
He gives a horrible sharp toothed smile and leaps at Leah
He holds her down She tries to resist but is no match

His tongue flicks out at her again this time smacks her in
the eye

He lowers his head down they’re now nose to nose

Leah releases a horrifying scream before Frog Man kisses her
on the lips

EXT PARK - NIGHT
The pond is calm no one around

In the background the school is in clear view Loud music
comes from the building

Two frog’s hop into view just on the edge of the water One
big one slightly smaller

They stand peering out across the pond The big one leans
into the smaller one licks its cheek

FADE OUT
