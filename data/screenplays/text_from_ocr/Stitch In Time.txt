FADE IN
THE WARNER BROTHERS LOGO

-but not the full color computer-enhanced logo we see at
the beginning of every Warner Brothers movie No this one’s
much cooler circa 1959 glowing in silvery black and white
tones an icon of an age when Sinatra was rapidly becoming the
defining quintessence of cool

OPENING CREDITS are presented Saul Bass-style in black and
white on a stylized background TITLE MUSIC is pure late 50’s
potboiler -- ominous overheated jazzy It’s Bernard Herrman
meets Mickey Spillane heavy on strings horns and bongos

EXT - LOS ANGELES 1959 - NIGHT

which brings us to a landscape of city lights aglow in
black and white SUPER TITLE

Once upon a time in the City of Angels

COLOR BLEEDS INTO THE IMAGE as we BOOM DOWN to -
AN ALLEY

-- where we meet LENNY THE DWARF DWORKIN a crazed little
man (not actually a dwarf) lugging two enormous suitcases His
eyes are huge behind thick glasses He sets his luggage down
at the mouth of the alley to catch his breath eyeing a jazz
club across the street with LOUS THE BLUES written in neon
Hot smoky JAZZ MUSIC drifts seductively into the night

Lenny is about to press on when suddenly

OFFICER NED CHRISTY walks into view a young black rookie in a
blue uniform swinging his baton and peering into darkened
storefronts as he walks his beat

LENNY draws back into the shadows of the alley becoming one
with the trash cans He glances over in alarm at his suitcases
sitting in plain view at the mouth of the alley The cop is
bound to see them Lenny pulls a small cheap automatic

CHRISTY keeps coming closer oblivious to the danger

LENNY’S holding his breath Waiting Will the cop go by or
will he have to kill him Suddenly headlights sweep the mouth
of the alley as a CAR turns a corner and pulls up in front of
Lou’s TWO MEN in hats get out Christy doubles back across
the street toward then

CHRISTY
Excuse me That’s a red zone

STITCH
Write me a ticket I’11 wallpaper
my bathroon

Christy steps closer and recognizes NICK STITCHLER aka
Stitch Stitch has that Sinatra thing that defining
quintessence of cool He’s 40’s a bachelor no-nonsense and
resolute a man’s man with a streak of wiseass in him His
partner is DANNY PEARL equally resolute a soft-spoken family
man They’re plainclothes cops Danny has a newspaper under
his arm with the headline “ARSON EPIDEMIC

CHRISTY
Sorry sir Didn’t recognize you
(indicates Lou’s)
Your fourth night in a row You
must love the jazz here

DANNY
Owner’s been nervous lately what
with all the fires we’ve been
having We get the chance we pop
in and show our faces around

STITCH
And yes we love the jazz Join
us Cops drink free

CHRISTY
Thanks I don’t drink

DANNY
Doesn’t drink on duty Very
commendable
CHRISTY
No sir I don’t drink period
Gotta stay sharp Set an example
He tips his hat and smiles Off he goes walking his beat

STITCH
Kid’s a deviate

INT - LOU’S THE BLUES - NIGHT

As hot and smoky as the music being played Stitch and Danny
enter LOU the middle-aged black proprietor tends bar

LOU

STITCH
Doubles Lou Gotta stay sharp Set
an example

Lou shoots him a look starts making the drinks Stitch leans
heavily on the bar grumbling to Danny

STITCH
Another red zone

DANNY

STITCH
Wasn’t there yesterday This city
grows red zones overnight Like

mushrooms

DANNY
Stitch I’m begging You hear me

Lou slides them their drinks Both cops turn their attention
to the BLACK JAZZ COMBO on the tiny stage Lou leans on the
counter picks up Danny’s newspaper starts reading

PUSH IN on the headline ARSON EPIDEMIC CAMERA TILTS UP off
the words and DISSOLVES THROUGH THE CEILING to

THE FLOOR ABOVE

Empty offices Deserted at this time of night MUFFLED MUSIC
comes from the club below Lenny the Dwarf wearing oversized
rubber galoshes splashes around in an inch-deep pool of
gasoline as he douses the walls and floor with a jerry can

Lenny hurls the empty can away -- it clatters and bounces onto
a pile of empties in the corner

He pulls another jerry can from a suitcase Uncaps it Flings
gasoline as he spins around dancing to the jazz An artist at
work The Picasso of firebugs One happy man

INT - LOU’S THE BLUES - NIGHT

Stitch glides to a table occupied by a lovely BLONDE and sits
She throws him a challenging look

BLONDE
What’s on your mind

STITCH
You Me A nice chianti Linguini
and clams Soft lights The samba
Did I mention I’m a great dancer

BLONDE

You really expect to get anywhere
with that line

STITCH
If you‘re quick on the uptake
You’re starting out slow Better
pick it up or you’ll lose me

The blonde loves this She raises her martini to her lips and
gives him a coy smile - but a drop of gasoline lands in her
drink Stitch frowns and takes the glass from her Did
something really fall in it or is it his imagination

Another drop lands unexpectedly on his cheek He looks up
The ceiling is soaking through from above Drops falling

He wipes the drop off his cheek and sniffs his fingertips His
eyes go wide he lunges from his chair --

STITCH
EVERYBODY OUT

-- and the place EXPLODES blowing him right off his feet and
disintegrating the bottles behind the bar People are knocked
out of their chairs by an immense concussive fireball that
races across the ceiling --

EXT - LOU’S - NIGHT

-- and blows all the windows out into the street on tongues of
flame Stitch’s car instantly ignites

INT - LOU’S - NIGHT

Fire Chaos Panic Stitch and Danny struggle through the
flames herding people out the exits Behind them the ceiling
collapses in a storm of flaming debris as we

cuT TO
EXT - LOU‘S - NIGHT

FIREMEN fight a losing battle with the blaze with more trucks
arriving A CROWD has gathered Stitch Danny and Christy are
helping move the spectators back across the street

Stitch finds Lou gazing at the fire with tears in his eyes
watching his life burn to the ground Stitch wishes there were
some comfort to offer There isn’t Gently

STITCH
Cc’mon Lou We gotta move you back
across the street

LOU

(softly)
Fuck it

Lou turns and walks away never looking back Stitch keeps
moving the spectators back suddenly seeing

Lenny the Dwarf stands in the crowd staring at the fire with
a crazed sort of glee Spittle stains his chin The round
lenses of his glasses reflect the fire -- the man looks like
he has two holes of flame instead of eyes

Stitch sidles over to Danny

STITCH
Pinch me if I’m dreaming but ain’t
that Lenny Dworkin over there

DANNY
Lenny the Dwarf The torch artist
(subtle glance)
I’ll be damned Last I heard he was
polishing rocks at Sing-Sing

STITCH
Must’a got out Funny thing him
being here With a fire and all

Danny motions Christy over mutters

DANNY
There’s a guy in the crowd

CHRISTY

STITCH
Ixnay kid low profile White guy
Rumpled raincoat Grinning and
drooling like he just laid Marilyn
Monroe Figure he’s the one who
torched Lou’s

CHRISTY

STITCH
We’re laying odds So here’s how
we play it --

Christy’s no longer listening He charges into the crowd

CHRISTY
You there Step forward

Lenny realizes he’s been spotted He bolts knocking people
down Stitch and Danny exchange an exasperated glance

STITCH
Don’t you love rookies

DANNY
Ever so much

They wade into the crowd joining the chase

Up ahead Christy catches Lenny with a flying tackle that
takes them to the pavement Lenny rams an elbow into Christy’s
throat drags the choking cop upright jams a gun in his ear

Stitch and Danny draw their weapons and drop into a crouch
Bystanders scatter or flatten to the ground Lenny backs into
the street using Christy as a shield

LENNY
(shrill spittle flying)
Back off or I ventilate his head

STITCH
Don’t do it Lenny We’d have to
kill you Think of the paperwork

Lenny spots a red FIRE DEPARTMENT SEDAN Engine’s running He
drags the terrified rookie toward the car - but Christy rams
his elbow into Lenny’s gut slams him back against the car
Lenny lashes out pistol-whipping Christy Christy falls
leaving Lenny exposed

STITCH
Drop it

Lenny OPENS FIRE instead Stitch and Danny flatten Lenny
jumps in the car and floors it SCREECHING away

Stitch and Danny race into the street and send a VOLLEY OF
GUNFIRE after him The rear window is blown to fragments but
the car peels out of sight

STITCH
Quick Get the car

But Danny just gives him a long dour look Stitch turns
Their car is a ball of flame parked in the red zone in front

of Lou’s The building collapses flattening it as we

THORSEN
Oh Seems to me you let the suspect
escape but maybe I’m wrong Feel
free to contradict me Am I wrong

OUTSIDE THORSEN‘S OFFICE

Christy is within earshot as he hunt-and-pecks his report on a
manual typewriter A long MUFFLED TIRADE OF SHOUTING is heard
then silence Stitch and Danny exit the office Christy rises
to speak but Stitch freezes him with a look and walks on

CHRISTY
It was my fault Why didn’t he tell
the captain

Danny just shrugs and smiles He yanks Christy’s report from
the typewriter crumples it up and trails after Stitch

EXT - PRECINCT - NIGHT
Danny catches up with Stitch outside

STITCH
That’s it I’ve had it with this
job -- with this city Look

He jabs a finger through a bullet hole in his charred sleeve
wags the finger under Danny’s nose

STITCH
We get blown up and shot at for
what To get our asses chewed

DANNY
You feel unloved You’re in the
wrong line of work All they
promised was a gun and a badge

STITCH
I’ve had it Danny I’m cashing in
I’m gonna go be a cop in some
godforsaken little town way out in
the country somewhere Like Encino

DANNY
There’s nothing in Encino but cows

STITCH
Exactly When was the last time a
cow took a shot at you If you’re
smart you’ll come along LA
doesn’t need us Maybe it did once
but not anymore

DANNY
So youre gonna turn in your
notice Just like that

STITCH

EXT - STREET NIGHT

Dark clouds gathering Distant flashes within the clouds A
storm coming in TILT DOWN to

A business district of office buildings A Chinese laundry An
all-night diner straight out of Edward Hopper Not many people
out A couple scurry by eager to beat the storm

A car pulls up Stitch Danny Christy and Lenny get out
They cross the street toward a five-story pre-war OFFICE
BUILDING with an elaborate iron fire escape

INT - BUILDING LOBBY - NIGHT

The group enters greeted by a few potted plants some leather
club chairs a long counter with message slots

LENNY
Never seen nobody else up there

A look passes between Stitch and Danny Stitch pulls a quarter
from his pocket prepares to toss

STITCH
I call heads

He flips the coin slaps it to the counter It’s heads Danny
sighs (This has all the earmarks of long-standing ritual)

STITCH
You babysit the rookie

Christy is stung by this Stitch doesn’t care -- he pockets

the coin drags Lenny into the elevator shuts the folding
iron gate The elevator rises from view arrow creeping around

CHRISTY
What’s with the coin toss

DANNY
We always flip to see who stakes
the lobby I always lose I

past the son of a‘ bitch

INT - FIFTH FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT

Stitch dogs Lenny from the elevator to a door The words on
the pebbled glass read “PHILLIP RANDOM - Attorney Stitch
flattens against the wall draws his 45 knocks gently

INT - RANDOM’S OFFICE - NIGHT

Shadowy lit by a desk lamp PHILLIP RANDOM an oily young man
with a pencil-thin mustache whispers into the phone

RANDOM

He puts the receiver down slinks across the roon

LENNY (0S)
Mr Random It’s me Lenny Dworkin

THE DOOR
opens a crack and Random peers out

RANDOM
Dworkin Are you crazy coming here
Every cop in town’s looking for you

Stitch’s hand enters frame grabs Random’s necktie and pulls
his face into the crack of the door Random’s features are
squeezed his eyes bugging out as Stitch leans close

STITCH
Yeah He knows

Stitch kicks the door open and propels Random back across the
room against his desk He jams his 45 to Random’s nose

STITCH
We’re gonna play 20 questions If I
think you’re holding back I pull
the trigger and you spend the rest
of your life breathing through your
armpits Are we clear on the rules

CAMERA PANS OVER THE DESK to the phone -- whoever‘s on the
line can hear what’s going on

IN ANOTHER OFFICE

FRANKY DOYLE has the phone to his ear listening He‘’s a
small-time gangster in his early 20’s young but with eyes
like flint With him is JIMMY THE SKINK a skinny 18 year-old
sociopath with a rabid grin and acne scars BULL BEIFUS is
built like a beer truck Other THUGS hover close by

STITCH’S VOICE (filtered)
First question How does a low rent
shyster like you foot the bill for
a citywide barbecue

RANDOM’S VOICE (filtered)
I’m just a go-between I deliver
instructions and keep the books
that’s all I do
Doyle looks up toward the ceiling as LIGHTNING tears the sky

DOYLE
Random‘s got company

OUTSIDE THE BUILDING

Through a fourth-floor window we see Franky Doyle looking up
at the ceiling Through a fifth floor window (the office just
above his) we see Stitch grilling Random

IN THE LOBBY

Christy peers out the window at the approaching storm Danny
sunk in a club chair stifles a yawn

DANNY
Wanna make yourself useful grab us
some coffee across the street
IN RANDOM‘S OFFICE

Lenny is crouched in front of the safe turning the dial

RANDOM

Lenny opens the safe and pulls out a sheaf of documents in a
cloth binder He sorts through it

LENNY
Some guy named Francis P Doyle

STITCH
(to Random)
Franky Doyle That two-bit
douchebag He’s behind all this

the doorway guns drawn Lenny gasps

DOYLE
That would be a yes

Stitch pivots and hurls Random into Doyle knocking the whole
group into the hallway in a tangled heap He slams the door
and locks it diving away as BULLETS tear through the wood
IN THE LOBBY

The SOUND OF THUNDER masks the sound of gunshots Danny’s in
the club chair bored drumming his fingers

ON THE FIRE ESCAPE

Stitch throws the window open and looks out One of Doyle’s
goons is coming up the fire escape cutting them off

STITCH
(mutters)
Should’a read my horoscope today

Stitch drags Lenny up the fire escape Behind them the door
bursts in splintered off its hinges by Bull

LOW ANGLE OF BUILDING

Stitch and Lenny scramble up the fire escape with Doyle and
his boys in hot pursuit ANGLE PULLS BACK to reveal Christy at
the diner’s counter across the street oblivious

CHRISTY
Better make that four coffees

ON THE ROOF

Stitch and Lenny run through a jumble of air ducts becoming
separated in the twists and turns Stitch rolls up the dossier
of evidence and slam-dunks it down an air vent

INSIDE THE VENT

The evidence clatters into the vent bounces off a spinning
fan blade and scatters into a narrow space in the roof

STITCH

skids to a stop and flattens into the shadows He pulls his
gun and looks around in desperation He can hear Doyle’s men
SHOUTING to each other as they comb the roof

Lenny suddenly steps into view a dark silhouette He seems
bewildered lost Stitch reaches out and grabs him pulling
him into the shadows Lenny is weeping

LENNY
I never should’a listened It’s all
your fault

STITCH
Take it easy Lenny I’11 get you
out of this

knife sticking out of Lenny’s stomach Lenny is staring down
at the knife weeping at the sight of so much of his own
blood He sinks to his knees as Stitch gapes in horror

Bull looms from the darkness Stitch spins to shoot but Bull
grabs his hand and squeezes until we hear bone cracking
Stitch screams as the gun discharges harmlessly into the air
Bull plucks it from Stitch’s hand and hurls it away

Stitch gazes up in awe at the big man We’re talking trouble
Bull proceeds to bounce Stitch off the wall again and again
methodically and brutally Playing handball with hin

DOYLE (0S)
Give it a rest

ANGLE SHIFTS to reveal Doyle and Jimmy the Skink drifting from
the shadows Jimmy’s CLICK-CLACKING a large butterfly knife
open and shut open and shut He stoops to pull its twin
viciously out of Lenny’s stomach Lenny gasps Jimmy starts
CLICK-CLACKING both knives in perfect unison Doyle’s thugs
yank Lenny to his feet and search hin They come up empty

THUG 1
Ain‘t here Boss

Doyle cocks his head They drag Lenny to the edge of a sloping
skylight The elevator pulley is just below the dingy glass
and below that is empty space -- the elevator shaft

STITCH
Jesus Don’t do it

Lenny teeters at the edge of his balance weeping as he gazes
down into the void Jimmy leans in close

LENNY
Pleaseit ain’t my fault

JIMMY
How high do you bounce

Jimmy shoves him Lenny lets out a wail as he plunges through
the glass He SCREAMS all the way down the shaft and vanishes

into darkness A final DISTANT THUD Jimmy peers after hin

JIMMY
Not very high

Stitch gets searched Doyle takes his wallet flips it open to
find a gold detective’s badge He flings the wallet away

DOYLE
A solid gold dick LA‘s finest
You have something of mine

Stitch says nothing Doyle glances at Jimmy and Bull They
work Stitch over until he goes to his knees

DOYLE
Ill ask again

STITCH
Ask all you want

Jimmy and Bull yank Stitch to his feet and slam him back
against the base of a radio relay tower where they secure him
with his own handcuffs Jimmy pulls a knife whirling it open
in front of Stitch’s eyes

STITCH
I‘m impressed You ever get tired
of working for him you can get a
good job in a Chinese restaurant

Jimmy leans in nose to nose LIGHTNING tears the sky

JIMMY
You gonna sing

STITCH
I look like a fat lady to you

Jimmy backs up throws the knife It THUNKS solidly in the
wooden backboard of the relay tower a scant hairbreadth to
the right of Stitch’s neck LIGHTNING FLASHES

Jimmy pulls out the second knife and CLICK-CLACKS it open He

glances at Doyle Doyle nods Jimmy throws It slams into
place just to the left of Stitch’s neck MORE LIGHTNING

Jimmy pulls out yet a third knife

DOYLE
Jimmy put this one dead center of
the other two

Stitch gulps Dead center means right into his throat

DOYLE
Last chance Detective

STITCH
Go piss in your hat

Doyle nods to Jimmy Jimmy twirls the blade open with a
flourish then draws his arm back for the final throw --

-- and a MASSIVE BOLT OF LIGHTNING strikes the relay tower

engulfing Stitch in a HUGE FLASH of inconceivably high voltage
We hear his drawn-out SCREAM as the world goes nuclear white

Doyle and his men are knocked right on their asses

The lightning dies The gangsters rise gaping in shock
Aftershocks of electricity skitter up and down the tower in
vaporous strands then dissipate entirely

Stitch is gone In his place hangs something resembling a
charred tattered scarecrow swaying in the wind

BULL
Oh yuck

DOYLE
Fried him Just like that

They tear their eyes off the grisly sight and hurry away PUSH
IN on the smoking corpse A charred watch slithers off the
wrist and drops near Stitch’s discarded badge and gun

FIFTH FLOOR HALLWAY

Doyle and his men rush down the stairs from the roof and
hustle onto the elevator Bull starts to close the folding
iron door but a MATRONLY LADY with a feathered hat appears

LADY
Hold the lift please

Bull holds the door Doyle glares at him as she gets on

IN THE LOBBY

Danny paces the floor He glances up sees the elevator
finaily start to descend

IN THE STREET

Christy is walking back from the diner with coffee and
doughnuts collar turned up against the drizzle

IN THE ELEVATOR

The matronly lady is surrounded by stone-faced gangsters all
trying to look innocent as newborn babies Everybody’s staring
straight ahead nobody saying a word

A small drop of blood lands on the lady’s hat Bull glances
up He nudges the others TILT UP to reveal Lenny the Dwarf’s
mangled face protruding through the smashed ceiling of the
elevator just above the lady’s head his eyes wide and
staring his tongue distended and blue He seems to be looking
directly down at her making an awful face The thugs have to
bite their lips to keep from laughing

IN THE LOBBY

Danny watches the arrow approach the ground floor Christy
enters grinning as he shakes water off his uniform

CHRISTY
You like sweetrolls sir

Danny looks at hin distracted as the elevator stops He turns
back as the gate opens expecting to see Stitch Instead

Doyle and his men are exiting the elevator Realizing there
are cops in the lobby

An eternity passes in the space of a mere heartbeat Then
things explode fraction-of-a-second events ticking out in
agonizing SLOW MOTION as if molasses had been poured into the
very gears and cogs of time itself

THE GANGSTERS go for their guns coats snapping back as
weapons fly free --

DANNY goes for his gun fully aware that he’s a dead man but
drawing anyway face contorting as he screams a pointless
warning to Christy --

A VIDEO MONITOR winks to life showing an exterior view of the

bolts into the roof turbines -- or is it the other way around

Is the machinery actually spewing lightning skyward

Lefko and the ethers crowd around the monitor stunned

and magazines which now lie scattered on the floor He picks
the paper up his breath catching in his throat as he sees

TWO COLOR PHOTOS side by side The first is Buzz Aldrin
saluting our flag on the moon The second is President Clinton
honoring the crew’s achievement at a White House ceremony The
headline reads 30TH ANNIVERSARY OF MOON LANDING

Stitch checks the paper’s masthead date July 20 1999 At
first he’s too stunned to react

He looks at the magazines at his feet The cover of TIME has a
dozen identical babies climbing out of test tubes under the
headline CLONING HUMANS - THE NEXT STEP NEWSWEEK’s cover
has a photo of a NASA probe on the surface of Mars with the
headline COLONIZING MARS IN THE NEXT CENTURY

Its definitely sinking in He steps up on the metal bench

craning to peer through the small wire-mesh window set high on
the wall The first thing he sees out there is a live picture

UN

of himself on the video feed He’s watching himself standing
on the bench staring out the tiny window

He turns sees the surveillance camera on the wall
tentatively waves his hand His image on the video screen does
exactly the same thing He finds it disorienting

Stitch peers this way and that He sees digital clocks A
tiny color TV showing the Hyperdyne fire Glowing computer
screens (one of which is running the “Flying Toasters screen
saver which strikes him as particularly odd) In short a lot
of things that didn’t exist in 1959

He sits trying to get past the “holy shit factor He studies
the newspaper in amazement turns it over and sees

Christy and Stitch turn to look at the car It’s totaled
beyond repair blowing steam from the ruptured radiator

STITCH
I never had much luck parking in
the red

Christy does a slow burn really pissed Random’s toupe drifts
from the sky like a furry parachute and lands before them
They proceed toward the building passing people rushing out
to see the accident

INT - LOBBY —- DAY

Stitch and Christy find the elevators Christy jabs the
button fuming Stitch glances over and sees

Jimmy the Skink is getting off the service elevator with his
maintenance crew and hurrying through a side exit

Stitch is rocked with recognition He’d know that psychotic
acnescarred face anywhere He grabs Christy pulls him along

EXT - BUILDING - DAY

Stitch and Christy rush out Stitch scans above the crowd
sees Jimmy and his crew loading into a white utility van

CHRISTY
You wanna tell me what’s going on

Stitch fights his way through the crowd with Christy at his
heels Jimmy’s van is pulling out leaving

An AMBULANCE screeches to the curb Two PARAMEDICS leap out
and hurry toward the mangled Taurus

Stitch sees the opportunity and grabs it -- he leaps behind
the wheel of the ambulance and cranks the key Again a spark
of electricity zaps him -- he cries out in pain but turns the
key all the way over The engine starts

PARAMEDIC
HEY STOP

STITCH
Police emergency

He jams it in gear and hits the gas -- the ambulance shoots
forward and jumps the curb The crowd scatters Christy rips
open the passenger door running alongside

CHRISTY
ARE YOU CRAZY

STITCH
Get in or get left behind

Christy has no choice -- he heaves himself into the passenger
seat Stitch swerves back into the street

CHRISTY
Pull this goddamn thing over right
now I‘m gonna slap you nine
different shades of purple

STITCH
See that white van up ahead
They’re the ones who just hammered
your car into the pavement

CHRISTY
quick attitude change)
Don’t lose the motherfuckers

EXT - STREETS - VARIOUS ANGLES - DUSK EVENING

The white van cruises through traffic The ambulance is some
distance behind tailing it

IN THE VAN

Jimmy strips off his white janitor’s jumpsuit revealing a
classic black tux with tails underneath

EXT - HANCOCK PARK ESTATE - DUSK

A sprawling multi-million dollar estate Some big event is
getting under way GUESTS in formal dress are arriving An
army of VALET ATTENDANTS park expensive cars while USHERS
direct the guests to the grounds behind the house

Jimmy’s van goes past the main driveway and up a smaller
service driveway disappearing through an electric gate

ANGLE SHIFTS to a COUPLE in immaculate evening wear handing
their Jaguar keys to a VALET Suddenly an ambulance swerves
up the driveway tears through a hedgerow and lurches to a
stop on the rosebushes Stitch gets out

STITCH
Don’t park it under a tree pal
The sap ruins the finish

CHRISTY
(trailing nervously)
Look let‘’s just forget this

Stitch ignores him heading for the backyard An USHER tries
to stop then

USHER
Your invitation

STITCH
Lost in the mail Piss off

Stitch leads Christy into the backyard -- which is more like
the tiered grounds of a palace Our two heroes find themselves
overlooking an area big enough for a royal wedding An amazing
buffet is being served A LIVE ORCHESTRA is playing

Stitch studies the crowd below his gaze coming to rest on

JIMMY THE SKINK exits the main house in his tux and tails to
join the party Somehow the clothes make him look even nore
sinister -- like grinning death in a tuxedo He comes to a
small knot of people chatting and laughing

The host is FRANCIS DOYLE - he’s got distinguished silver
hair a nice tan and the world by the balls He’s the very
picture of wealth and success Among the people chatting with
him are MAYOR HART DA Heller and Mary Sullivan

Stitch has his attention riveted to Doyle as a SOCIETY LADY
ushers him to the microphone to speak

DOYLE
Thank you all for attending our
little charity event this evening
The auction will get underway at
eight o’clock as scheduled Until
then yes the food is free

The crowd laughs An EFFEMINATE MAN leans over to Stitch

MAN
I’m bidding on Judy Garland’s ruby
slippers

Stitch shoots him a humorless look The man shrinks away

DOYLE
I know you’11 all join me in
thanking Mayor Hart for his
presence tonight

The guests applaud Hart waves flashes a winning grin Stitch
keeps his eyes on Doyle taking his measure as

DOYLE
I‘d also like to thank the Society
for allowing me to host tonight’s
fundraiser Education is a vital
concern to all of us The money you
spend here will help put computers
in classrooms and allow inner city
youth vital access to the
information superhighway -- their
doorway to the future Needless to
say we should all dig deep No
cheapskates allowed

Laughter and applause Doyle holds up his hands modestly
accepts their kindness

STITCH
Look at him He looks like a rat
turd floating in a champagne

cocktail

CHRISTY
Francis P Doyle The Francis P
Doyle

STITCH

He’s nothin’ but Franky Doyle to
me A two-bit slug who’d sell his
own motherfor spare parts

Stitch starts down toward the party Christy grabs hin

CHRISTY
No way you’re going down there

STITCH
Just wanna say hi Mingle a little

CHRISTY
Read my lips -- no fucking way

STITCH
What’s the matter Ned Worried
about your pension

CHRISTY
As a matter of fact yes

STITCH
Well I’d hate to get you in dutch
with your boss

CHRISTY
That’s very considerate of --

In one swift fluid motion stitch swipes Christy’s handcuffs
from his belt and cuffs Christy’s wrist to the iron railing
Christy is flabbergasted then furious He reaches into his
pocket for his keys but they aren’t there Stitch holds up
them up jingling them out of reach

STITCH
Abracadabra

CHRISTY
You pick-pocket son of a bitch

STITCH
I learned that little trick from a
second-story man called Ike Had an
eye that twitched He cuffed me to
the rear bumper of a Greyhound bus
I wound up in Barstow

Stitch pockets the keys heads down the steps toward the
party Christy glances around self-consciously He grabs a
drink from a passing tray takes a cursory sip sets it down
It’s not the booze he’s after it’s the swizzle stick -- he
plucks it from the glass starts picking his handcuff lock

DOYLE’S GROUP

A loose knot of mingling people chatting and laughing Mary
looks pleasantly bored Mayor Hart leans over to her

HART
Ms Sullivan do you intend to bid
this evening

MARY
Well Mr Mayor I did have my eye
on the hat that Humphrey Bogart
wore in the Maltese Falcon

Mary freezes seeing Stitch coming down the stairs Stitch
snaps a jaunty wave keeps coming down toward her

MARY
Oh my God

HELLER
(follows her gaze)
What’s he doing here

DOYLE
Is there some problem

MARY
That man I think he’s following me

Doyle gives Jimmy a look take care of it Jimmy detaches
from the group moving out to block Stitch’s path

JIMMY
Private party Friends of Mr Doyle
only
STITCH

Franky and I go back a long way I
remember when he was running whores
in Chinatown

People are starting to glance over Jimmy presses closer
showing a bulge under his jacket -- 4 holstered gun

JIMMY
You know what this is

STITCH
You’re showing me your bulge Does
that mean you like me

JIMMY
It means you don’t belong here
Allow me to show you out

Stitch backs down motions “lead the way Jimmy does - but
instead of following Stitch peels Jimmy’s tux jacket from
behind and yanks the coat down around his arms binding then
In the same fluid motion he yanks Jimmy’s revolver from his
holster and kicks him in the butt Jimmy goes sprawling The
guests fall silent all eyes on Stitch He holds Jimmy’s gun
up admiring it

STITCH
Qooch it’s a big one You must be
popular

CHRISTY

is picking the handcuffs with the swizzle stick He is
suffering as he watches Stitch wishing he were anywhere but
here

JIMMY

looks demonic as he gets to his feet ready to hurl himself at
Stitch -- but a gesture from Doyle stops hin

Jimmy holds out his hand demanding his gun back stitch
shakes out the bullets reaches across the buffet table and
drops the revolver into a pot of bubbling hot fondue

STITCH
Pick it up from the cook

He grabs a glass of champagne from a waiter’s tray as he
crosses toward Mary and Doyle

STITCH
Hiya doll Miss me
DOYLE
I don’t believe I’ve had the

pleasure

(CONTTNUFDS

STITCH
I don’t believe you will
(looks around)

It’s a party

The guests go back to their mingling Stitch turns to Heller

STITCH
Say John ain’t that the damnedest
thing about Phillip Random

HELLER
I beg your pardon

STITCH
Oh didn’t you hear Seems he tried
to skip out on your subpoena
Didn‘t get very far though Only
about thirty stories

Doyle and Jimmy exchange a look

HELLER
What are you saying

STITCH
I’m saying he took a dive out his
office window Habeus corpus‘d
himself all over a car

HELLER
(stunned)
Oh my God Random’s dead

STITCH
If getting scraped up with a
spatula is any indication

Heller looks devastated Mary puts a comforting hand on his
arm Doyle moves closer to Stitch facing him

DOYLE
This is terribly sad news

STITCH
(shrugs)
Back in school he was voted most
likely to be identified by his
dental records He was your lawyer
wasn’t he

Doyle regards Stitch with reptilian eyes sizing him up
Stitch returns his gaze with cold amusement

DOYLE
Call the security patrol and have
this gentleman escorted from the

neighborhood

HEAD USHER
I just did sir Theyll be here iin
a minute

STITCH

That should be enough time for a
quick spin on the dance floor

He takes Mary by the hand pulling her along

HELLER

get escorted you’ll have her all
to yourself

MARY
The name‘’s Mary Sullivan Not
baby Not doll Not sweetheart

STITCH
I suppose boo-boo cakes is out
MARY
Those terms are demeaning
STITCH
No kidding I thought they were

affectionate

MARY
That’s because you’re an
overbearing sexist with
testosterone for brains

STITCH
I’d resent that if I knew what it
meant

MARY
Who are you

STITCH

If I said “the guy you’ve been
waiting for all your life would
you think me forward

MARY
I’d think you a lunatic
STITCH
Yeah but a swell dancer right
MARY
You are light on your feet For a
lunatic
STITCH

My mother’s doing She was a dance
instructor Always said a young man
should know how to fling a gorgeous
babe across the floor

Suddenly WESTEC GUARDS appear coming through the crowd

HEAD USHER

STITCH

He tilts her chin up and gazes into her eyes
STITCH

This has been the most meaningful
forty five seconds of my life

reason to believe suspects were
fleeing the scene

JONAS
Suspects Phillip Random was facing
a subpoena He committed suicide

OUTSIDE JONAS’ OFFICE

Stitch is listening at the door A LONG MUFFLED TIRADE OF
SHOUTING is heard Abrupt silence Christy exits the office

tin of Anacin from his pocket fumbling as he tries to open it
with shaking fingers

’ STITCH
(gently)
You all right

CHRISTY
Yeah sure for a man staring at a

explode

Stitch takes the tin of Anacin opens it for him Christy pops
a few in his mouth dry swallowing with a grimace

CHRISTY

Look all I know is I’m on that
roof in 1959 doing the electric
Carioca and suddenly I’m not there

The elevator arrives and they get on Stitch presses the down

Stitch’s old neighborhood We’ve seen this view before but
there’s a key difference what used to be a half-completed
freeway under construction is now a freeway that was built a
long time ago It’s choked with traffic just another part of
the LA landscape

ANGLE WIDENS on the same lovely Mexican statue of Christ
standing guard over the same concrete foot bridge Stitch and
Christy come across the bridge turn the corner

-and find a sprawling mall ala Citywalk The hillside
bungalows and orange trees are long gone replaced by trendy
shopping a Lazertag parlor a California Pizza Kitchen a
movie six-plex -- basically a glitzyghastly neon monument to
consumerism and bad taste

Hitler’d be tooling around in a
goddamn Ford What the hell kind of
world is this

Different You given any thought to
what you’re gonna do

STITCH
What’s an offramp

THE CAR

hurtles onto a freeway going in the wrong direction Oncoming
cars slam on their brakes careening wildly A big-rig truck
swerves across three lanes AIR HORN BLOWING

Stitch avoids a hair-raising series of head-on collisions by
mere inches They swerve to a stop on the center divider and
jump out Stitch gawks at the traffic raging by in both
directions

CHRISTY
That’s it That’s the last time I
let you drive From now on you
don’t even parallel park

STITCH
What the hell is this

CHRISTY
It’s a freeway Like the Arroyo

fedora Bogart’s hat from The Maltese Falcon She puts it
on glowing like a kid It’s a few sizes big but she loves
it She squints her eyes and twitches her upper lip ala
Bogie A cat leaps up on the sink to investigate MEOWS

street and wrestling with old memories Softly

CHRISTY
I never even knew what hit me All
I remember is lying there in that
doorway thinking I got hit by a
train And wondering where the
goddamn train came from

STITCH
On that roof is the evidence that’1l
put Franky Doyle away for keeps

CHRISTY
(glances up)
Too bad they built a club for
racist shitheads on top of it

STITCH
No sweat We tear up the floor

Not without a court order And we
need a goddamn good reason for that

CHRISTY
Look things aren’t like they used

anymore They’ve got civil rights

instance Remember what they told
you when you got arrested

Those are your constitutional
rights No suspect is ever arrested
without being apprised of those
That’s the law

Bullshit

No that’s straight shit

Stitch considers this for a long beat

STITCH
How do you ever get anything done

Christy shakes his head continues up the walk --
INT - CHRISTY’S HOUSE - NIGHT

CHRISTY
Just drop it okay

STITCH

That slime killed my partner Where
I come from that means something

Christy shrugs off his coat and heads for the closet

CHRISTY
Get over it Cops die all the time
It’s a dangerous job

STITCH
This is not Ned Christy talking
The Ned Christy I know would’ve
waltzed barefoot through hell to
nail a jaywalker He was ready to
take on the world

CHRISTY
The Ned Christy I know has fallen
arches and can no longer waltz
He’s the only cop I know who’d
rather do paperwork than be out on
the street

STITCH
Why

CHRISTY
Because out on the street people
shoot holes in you They gun you
down in lobby doorways and leave
you to die like some kind of animal
by the side of the road

Pause Christy realizes he’s trembling He runs a shaky hand
down his face as if to wipe the shame away Softly

CHRISTY
Jesus Mary Joseph I flinch every
time I hear a car backfire

STITCH
I’m sorry

CHRISTY
You should be You’re the one who
walked me into a wall of bullets my
first month on the job

Christy heads into the bathroom leaving Stitch to wrestle
with his guilt

Christy runs water in the sink and splashes his face trying
calm down Stitch appears in the doorway Softly

STITCH
Danny and I grew up together We
went ashore at Normandy and fought
through France together The day
his little girl was born we got
drunk and we laughed and wept
together The only thing we didn’t
do is die together And that’s the
single worst stroke of luck Frank
Doyle ever had -- ‘cause I1l see

Stitch enters toting a golf bag with a single nine-iron poking
out of it He weaves through the skinheads on the dance floor
and peers out the window at the fire escape He turns back
trying to get his bearings
He works his way back through the club trying to retrace the
path he took almost 40 years ago He winds and weaves ducking

and dodging around imaginary air ducts and fan housings

Bobby Scud is watching this strange behavior from the bar
working himself into a fine rage Slick does Iago in his ear

SLICK
Some pigs deserve what they get
Some even beg for it

Scud snorts a vial of amyl nitrate A flush creeps into his
face his pupils dilate He detaches from the bar

Stitch is staring at the floor having found his spot He
shrugs the golf bag off his shoulder frowning in
concentration as if studying a difficult tee Scud and the
others surround him They are blithely ignored

Piggy has returned

SHOUTS AND JEERS from the crowd A wave of hostility stitch
just keeps studying his spot unperturbed

Asshole don’t hear so good
Hey pig You deaf or what

Still no response Stitch pulls a pair of gardening gloves and
plastic goggles from the golf bag and puts them on He then
Chooses the nine-iron assumes a stance and draws aim on an
jmaginary ball This unflappable behavior sends Scud deeper
and deeper into a hysterical rage He wraps a heavy chain
around his fist preparing to split some skull

Shhh Observe this shot carefully
It’s called a “Rambo birdie

He swings and follows through driving the club up into Scud’s
crotch with incredible force -- THWACK

astonishment with Scud the most astonished of all He just
stands there experiencing awhole new definition of pain -- a
whole new universe of it

proceeds to kick some serious ass with his nine-iron He wades

PLAYBOY magazine in the lounge

STITCH
These dames aren’t wearing anything

Five thousand bucks I oughtta have
my head examined

STITCH
Zero Zilch Zippidy-doo-dah

Christy yanks the Playboy away and slaps a pair of Playtex
gloves into Stitch’s hands

Next time you get near anything

of watching you light up like some
cheap special effect

CUT TO
EXT - DOROTHY CHANDLER PAVILION - EARLY EVENING

The fountains are doing their synchronized dance CROWDS OF
PEOPLE in evening wear are arriving for the opera A HOMELESS
GUY with a saxophone is playing a sexy jazz solo for tips

We find Stitch Christy and Mary waiting in the midst of it
all DA Heller approaches through the crowd

HELLER
So What’s this about Had a change
of heart Come to confess

STITCH
Not me Try Franky Doyle oh
sorry Francis P
(off his look)
Some 40 years ago our pal Francis
arranged dozens of arson fires that
I know of Probably a lot more

Mary instantly regrets going along with this

MARY
I’m sorry if I’d known he was this
crazy

CHRISTY
Hear him out

HELLER

Okay I‘ll bite Why would one of
the most respected citizens of Los
Angeles burn it down

STITCH

The oldest motive in the world
Simple greed

(to Mary)
You get burned out Insurance
doesn’t pay you a dime because it
was arson Youve lost everything
Along comes Doyle offers to buy
your land What do you do

MARY
I sell

STITCH
Sure you sell and sell cheap You
have no choice So here’s Doyle
with all this land right Funny
thing the city comes along and
wants to buy his land to build
freeways on What does Doyle do

MARY
He sells

STITCH
Give the lady a cigar Doyle sells
at a staggering profit Buy cheap
sell dear It’s the American way

HELLER
Okay but how did Doyle guess where
the freeways were going to be

STITCH
He didn’t have to guess He had
Phillip Random greasing the palms
of certain city officials Buy a
vote here a vote there and before
you know it Doyle’s selling real
estate Instant freeway

Heller glances to Mary who’s still wondering how she got
talked into this

HELLER
You gotta hand it to him That’s
quite a story

STITCH
It gets better You know all these
fires you’ve been having lately

HELLER
You’re not implying

STITCH
I’m not implying anything I’‘n
saying it loud and clear Doyle’s
pulling the same hat trick he
pulled 40 years ago Only now it’s
this Metro Rail

MARY
(deadpan)
Sobasically what you’re saying
is Doyle’s guilty of the biggest
land swindle in the history of mankind

STITCH
That plus murder Phillip Random
for starters Doyle figured he’d
blab under subpoena so he gave him
a skydiving lesson

CHRISTY
No chute Oops

Heller thinks it over can’t help chuckling

HELLER
This delusional conspiracy theory
of yours is very entertaining I’m
the first to admit

STITCH
But

HELLER
Metro Rail isn’t like the freeways
Back then they bought up thousands
of acres entire neighborhoods
disappeared Today most of the
land already belongs to the city
Hell most of it’s underground

MARY
(looks to Stitch)
Good point

But it’s Christy who drives the final nail into the argument —

CHRISTY
You telling me fortunes won’t be
made or lost depending on where the
trains do or do not go You saying
whoever owns the land where the
next Century City springs up isn’t
gonna be a billionaire overnight

Mary is subdued by this turns back to Heller

MARY
Even better point

Heller’s wrestling with it in spite of himself Finally

HELLER
This is all bullshit unless you
have evidence to back it up

STITCH
Christy’s got the goods tucked away
nice and safe Right Ned

CHRISTY
Nice and safe

STITCH
There’s one condition When the
time comes Christy gets the
collar It‘’ll be a nice way to ring
down the curtain on a long and
distinguished career

CHRISTY
(touched)
Stitch Thanks man

STITCH
De nada We have a deal

HELLER
If that evidence of yours isn’t a
pipedream I’d say we do But how
did you come by all this Who the
hell are you

STITCH
Does it matter as long as Doyle
sticks to the wall when thrown

Heller smilesno it doesn’t He walks away leaving our
trio by the fountain

MARY
I think you actually convinced him

STITCH
Yeah What about you

She just smiles says nothing

CHRISTY
I gotta go clock out You need a
couch mine’s still vacant You
know where to find me

STITCH
Thanks pal

CHRISTY
See you around wiseguy

Christy walks away Stitch turns to Mary

STITCH
So this is goodbye

MARY
(thinks a beat)
You Me A nice chianti Linguini
and clams Soft lights The samba
Did I mention I’m a great dancer

Stitch is obviously not used to being on the receiving end of
a come-on She reads the confusion on his face

MARY

STITCH
I’ve been out of circulation for a
while I see things have changed

MARY
For the better

STITCH
That would be my guess

She goes into the bedroom Stitch wanders over to examine the
gear clueless as to their purpose He puts on his rubber
glove and tries pressing a few buttons

Suddenly a life-size Jimmy Cagney appears in black and white on
the projection TV behind hin cradling a Tommy gun

CAGNEY
Get those mitts in the air bub

Stitch freezes and raises his hands He starts to turn around

CAGNEY
Don’t turn around Just listen
good

Stitch doesn’t turn around He listens good

CAGNEY
You shouldn’t have done it How a
mug like you ever lived so long is
a wonder Say goodbye

Cagney opens fire Stitch dives over the couch

been dancing a whole three minutes
now without me getting thrown out

MARY

ANGLE SLOWLY TIGHTENS as they keep dancing against the
backdrop of city lights They’re drawing closer tighter
gazing into each other’s eyes

MARY
Stitch Tell me who you are

STITCH
The name on the birth certificate

just Nick My father was an
uncomplicated guy

MARY
You remind me of a cop

STITCH
Any cop in particular

MARY
Every cop I ever saw on the Late
Show Only you’re not in black and
white

STITCH
I had a badge Long time ago Your
turn Ever been married

MARY
Once Lawyers shouldn’t marry
lawyers It only complicates the
divorce

STITCH
What kind of guy was he

MARY
He ordered wine well

STITCH
Do I remind you of him at all

MARY
Not even remotely

By now were TIGHT on their faces Their lips melt together in
a passionate kiss They come up for air

lips off

MUSIC CONTINUES AS WE PAN THE ROOM past the bust of Bogart

couch in front of the fireplace their kisses steamy These
people are hot for each other They sink further and further
into the couch Mary pressing him back into the assorted
pillows and stuffed animals

»and Stitch glances at an old threadbare purple giraffe rag
doll about six inches from his face It stops him cold He
sits up

MARY
What is it

STITCH
Sotell me about your family

MARY
I beg your pardon

STITCH

Your family Start with your dad

MARY
I never knew him He died when I
was four

Stitch rises and goes to the mantle where old framed photos
are arrayed The look on his face says it all

PAN TO the photos many of which feature Danny and Iris or
Mary as a child In fact there’s one we remember being taken
Stitch and his goddaughter are out on the lake in the pedal
poat The little girl is laughing because the duck just
snatched the bread from her hand Stitch’s face is blurred
just a grainy black and white smudge from the distant past

MARY
Stitch What’s wrong

STITCH
Nothing I just hate it when good
cops die

MARY

How did you know he was a cop

For a moment we think he’s caught -- but he points at a photo
It’s an old sepia shot of Danny wearing his dress blues

STITCH
Looks like a fine man

He has to turn away to hide his emotions gazing out the
window at the city lights Softly

STITCH

You know that all used to be
orange groves as far as you could
see If the breeze was right you
could smell the honeysuckle all the
way downtown

of a large black Mercedes fiddling with his watch He presses
a button and the watch BEEPS the first few bars of Beethoven’s

DOYLE
Duh-duh-duh-dummmm I love that
Moment of truth You know there’s
something I keep asking myself

STITCH
And that is

DOYLE
Who are you and why do you persist
in bothering me

STITCH
When you ask yourself do you get
any answers

DOYLE
So far no You have no credit
history No tax history In fact
no history period Youve proven to
be something of an enigma A
living breathing conundrun

STITCH
I love the twenty dollar words you
use nowadays What’d you do go to
night school

Doyle’s men kidney-punch Stitch from behind driving him to
his knees Doyle detaches from the car hikes up the knees of
his trousers to preserve the crease squats down

DOYLE
Have we met somewhere before Do we
know each other

STITCH
I’m the ghost of Christmas past I
haunted you once remember

Doyle looks up at his men They hurl stitch face-first into
the grill of the car bounce him off the bumper a few times
They kick him stomp him Stitch curls up on the ground Doyle
grabs his lapels and hauls him up face to face

DOYLE
I‘ll say it in plain English so you
understand See this watch it cost
more than most people earn in a
year See that building It’s my
building And yes the land it’s
on which I also own will be the
next Century City Along with
several others The point I’m
making is I’m far too important to
be fucking around with a cheapjack
little shit-for-brains like you

Stitch is shocked to hear Christy’s Century City analogy come
out of Doyle’s mouth but hides it He looks at the building

STITCH
I’m impressed You and your watch
can sit on top of the world and
sing songs to each other If you
press the right button maybe it’1l
remind you how important you are

TOP FLOOR OF GARAGE

Ray crouches next to the open door of a parked car Stitch is
behind the wheel -- in fact his hands are chained to the wheel

Ray presses a button on a stopwatchtransmitter and the LED
lights up counting down from 3 minutes by tenths of a second

UNDER A ROW OF CARS

All the LED readouts on the malglinite charges are counting
down in synchronization

RAY

hangs the stopwatch from Stitch’s rearview mirror

RAY

so do you

STITCH
Hell of a setup I’d tip my hat if
I could

RAY

Too bad you won’t be around to see

The white van pulls up Ray closes Stitch’s door walks to the
van gets in The van pulls away

Stitch is left with the stopwatch 2 minutes 29 seconds and
counting He tries to reach under the dashboard but can’t

STITCH
Well hotwiring’s out

He looks around mind racing desperately 2 minutes 2 seconds
left He thrashes around trying to break the steering wheel
No way Modern unitized construction

It suddenly occurs to him -- he bows his head forward and tips
his hat into his hands He roots around under the sweatband
and pulls out his trusty set of lock-picks

He twists around gets his Playtex gloves from his pocket
puts them on No sense getting zapped 1 minute 12 seconds He
eases the picks into the ignition feeling his way trying to
find the right combination of positions that will turn it

The ignition turns but only halfway A WOMAN’S VOICE suddenly
comes out nowhere intoning softly

WOMAN‘S VOICE

Stitch twists around looking in the back seat

STITCH

The car BURNS RUBBER backing out of the spot and SMASHES into
the cars opposite Stitch throws it in drive not even
bothering to take his foot off the accelerator The car burns
rubber again skittering sideways before the tires get their
traction -- the car blasts forward scraping along an entire
row of parked cars

It’s safe in there Helps you
forget why you ever became a cop

his own shame Stitch digs a quarter out of his pocket

legends A cop to make the gods
tremble Tails you’re a worthless
burned-out old alky

Stitch flips the coin slaps it to the table Christy leans
forward the suspense killing him Stitch lifts his fingers to

revealheads

Christy looks up slowly arriving at a quiet but monumental
decision He puts the bottle aside and rises heading into --

THE BEDROOM

-- where he pulls a shoe box from the closet and hands it to
Stitch Inside lies a gun a modest 38 revolver

CHRISTY

That’s my spare Do me a favor Try
not to shoot anyone

What am I saying Look who I’m
talking to

I’ve got some extra ammo here
somewhere Turn that light on

Without thinking Stitch clicks on a bedside lamp -- a massive
electrical charge blasts up his arm and envelopes him with
Sputtering energy He screams writhing as his image overlaps
several Stitches occupying the same space

The lamp EXPLODES Stitch reels across the room -- actually
many Stitches reel across the room all of them a fraction-of-
a-second out of sync with the other like a deck of cards
getting shuffled by a magician

STITCH

Purely on instinct Christy grabs him -- suddenly Christy is
out of sync in time as well The two of them dissolve like
jittering ghosts right through the wall into --

THE LIVING ROOM

finally stabilizes ‘their duplicate images accordioning back
into place with a SNAP The impact slams them both to the

floor where they lay gasping and trying to catch their
breath As their eyes meet

RAY
I‘1l blow his head off

(CONTTNTEDS

Stitch and Christy lock eyes Christy’s expression is heavy
with accusation - if he dies it‘’ll be Stitch’s fault Stitch
lowers his gun tosses it away

JONAS

IN THE STORE YOU’RE SURROUNDED

Billy Bones presses close to Ray sweating as he checks the
stopwatch 4 minutes 49 seconds and counting

BILLY BONES

place is gonna go bye bye

RAY
Get everybody up front

Billy Bones and Chin carry out the order herding all the
customers to the front of the store

BILLY BONES

EXT - MARKET - DAY

Jonas and the other cops watch as the terrified faces of the
hostages press up against the windows The automatic doors

Christy’s head)

RAY

EXT - MARKET - DAY

Stitch exits the store crosses the parking lot Jonas blinks
at the sight of hin

JONAS
What the hell are you doing here

STITCH
Giving them their car

He holds out his hand Jonas tosses him the keys
INT - UNMARKED CAR - DAY

Stitch gets in Sees the Ithaca shotgun in its floor rack
Puts on his rubber gloves Starts the engine

INT - SUPERMARKET - DAY

Ray and his men are staring out the window surrounded by
hostages Waiting

The car just sits engine idling -- then it shoots forward in
a cloud of blue smoke directly at the store

Everybody dives out of the way as Ray FIRES A BURST right
through the plate glass window at the oncoming car Stitch
ducks as his windshield disintegrates

The car plows into the supermarket in a storm of EXPLODING
GLASS AND STING METAL Chin is thrown onto the hood as the
car demolishes a checkstand and lurches to a stop

Chin raises his Mac but Stitch pokes the shotgun through the
shattered windshield one-handed and pulls the trigger BLAM
Chin gets it point-blank in the chest blown back off the hood
to land in a pyramid display of Ragu spaghetti sauce A gooey
explosion of homestyle goodness geysers into the air

PRAM TANTO

Stitch hurls the shotgun to Christy and hits the gas plowing
on through the checkstands Ray and Billy Bones unleash BURSTS
OF MACHINE GUN FIRE as the car careens after then

Christy starts herding hostages out the demolished storefront
Cops are rushing up helping people to safety

ANGLE ON AISLE

Ray and Billy Bones run like hell with the car right behind
them The vehicle’s wide -- its sides are plowing the shelves
churning cans and boxes into the air like a snow plow

The men split in two directions as the car hurtles out of the
aisle in a tight turn -- the rear end smashes into the dairy
case EXPLODING glass and milk in all directions

EXT - MARKET - DAY

CHRISTY
Everybody back This place is gonna
blow up

Everybody runsbut Christy pauses looking back ‘at the
market Hearing the battle rage within Torn between running
for his life and going back to help

INT - MARKET DAY

Stitch chases Ray and Billy Bones through the supermarket his
car destroying everything in its path Twisting Turning
Careening Smashing Unstoppable

Billy Bones emerges from an aisle near the front of the store
The car bursts into view in a cloud of smoking exhaust and
Rice-a-Roni battered beyond recognition tailpipe and muffler
dragging Billy raises his Mac to strafe the car

-but Christy pops up behind a checkstand shotqun leveled
CHRISTY
Drop it

Billy whirls to shoot Christy pumps him full of shotgun
rounds Billy is blown off his feet Mac BLAZING into the air

No sooner does Billy go down than Ray suddenly appears at the
far end of the checkstands FIRING A LONG BURST at Christy
Christy dives as bullets chew the register to pieces

ANGLE ON AISLE
Ray cuts down the aisle The car comes after him churning

through a tight turn -- and the vehicle gets jammed wedged
between the shelves wheels spinning in salad dressing

CHRISTY
breaks from cover running toward the back of the store
RESUME STITCH

Flooring the pedal The car spinning its wheels No traction
Ray turns back and grins raises his Mac

Stitch struggles to get out of the car The doors are wedged
solid by the shelves He ducks as BULLETS STRAFE the car

Ray empties’ the clip He then pulls a satchel charge from his
toolbelt yanks the ripcord and slides the explosive down the
aisle under the car Right under the gas tank

Ray turns and runs Stitch takes that as a sign something’s
about to go boom With seconds left and no choice he rips the
rubber glove from his hand and cranks the ignition Streams of
electricity race up his arm and envelope him He arches back
screaming as he drains the battery -- and his image begins to
overlap as his toehold in time goes unstable

THE CAR EXPLODES straight up out of the aisle on a rocket
booster of gasoline It flips through the air and lands upside
down completely engulfed in flame Sprinklers kick on

Stitch walks from the flames -- or rather countless Stitches
do all of them out of sync like a deck of cards being
shuffled Stitch stabilizes his duplicate images accordioning
back into place with a SNAP The impact knocks him flat

LOADING DOCKSUMP PUMP ROOM

Ray runs in He’s got only one escape route left He climbs
down the manhole --

INT - SEWER DAY

-- and slides down the steel ladder He gets to the bottom and
turns CLACK-CLACK There’s a shotgun aimed at his face

CHRISTY
What was that you said about
blowing my head off Could you
repeat that

RAY
We have to leave I mean it

CHRISTY

Yeah Why What’s so interesting
about this sewer anyway

SCONTT ATTEN

STITCH (0S from manhole)
Look above you Ned
Ray glances up astonished to see Stitch alive Aqain

Christy also looks up slowly realizing where he is right
under a malglinite charge The red LED is clicking away

Think that’s bad Wait ANGLE WIDENS OUT as Christy peers
around revealing a HUGE GAS MAIN that seems to run for miles
The pipe is inches above his head and it’s lined with

countless malglinite charges stretching in both directions
CHRISTY

Oh fuck me

Stitch comes down the ladder Ray is staring at him with
slack-jawed amazement

RAY
How do you keep doing that

CHRISTY
(grabs Ray furious)
Are you kidding me All this just
to take out a supermarket

STITCH
I don’t think so You know that
construction zone we drove by

CHRISTY
Out on Wilshire They’re digging
another subway tunnel What’s that
got to do with

He looks up at the gas main realization dawning

STITCH
the price of beans in Brazil

Stitch moves down the tunnel following the pipe Christy
brings up the rear prodding Ray ahead with the shotgun

We hear HEAVY MACHINERY ahead Lights appear as the SOUNDS
GROW LOUDER Stitch leads the way through the maze-like

understructure of Wilshire Boulevard edging past a series of
massive concrete underpinnings --

THE SUBWAY TUNNEL

- and emerging into the underground construction zone MEN
AND MACHINES everywhere It’s deafening Christy looks back
the way they came Sure enough the gas main runs parallel to
the subway tunnel Everybody shouts to be heard

CCONTTATIPN

CHRISTY
You’re blowing up the goddamn
tunnel Why

STITCH

This isn’twhere Doyle wanted it
You said it yourself it’s all
about property values You can’t
make a killing unless the trains go
where they’re supposed to

CHRISTY
So if you can’t bribe ‘em blow ‘em
up Jesus

STITCH
I bet they punched that big hole in
Hollywood Boulevard too

RAY
Sherlock fucking Holmes Can we go

Christy yanks the stopwatch from Ray’s neck

CHRISTY
Just turn the goddamn thing off
RAY
I can’t It’s not designed that
way
CHRISTY

What What kind of idiot makes a
bomb he can‘t turn off

They’ve been spotted A CONSTRUCTION TEAM approaches

FOREMAN
Hey What do you think you‘re
doing This area’s off limits

CHRISTY
Get your people out of here You’re
sitting on a bomb

FOREMAN

hell are you

Christy goes totally berserk waving his shotgun
CHRISTY
I’M CHICKEN LITTLE MOTHERFUCKER

AND THE SKY’S ABOUT TO FALL NOW
GET THE FUCK OUT

BLAM BLAM BLAM HE PUMPS SHOTGUN ROUNDS over their heads to
get them moving Instant pandemonium WORKERS flee for the
surface emptying the construction zone

Ray tries to join them but Stitch grabs his collar and yanks
him back

STITCH
Not so fast I haven’t read you
your rights

RAY
My what

CHRISTY
Screw that This is no time to get
politically correct

He shows him the stopwatch 59 seconds 58 seconds

STITCH
Ned We’re talking about a man’s
constitutional rights It’s the law

Before anyone can react Stitch peels the handcuffs from
Christy’s belt and cuffs Ray’s wrist to a steel support Ray
is stunned to find himself trapped Stitch dangles the key

STITCH
You have the right to remain
silent If you give up that right
I’1ll give you this key before the
tunnel goes boon

STITCH
That’s the plan

They turn and haul ass out of there Stitch tosses the key

Ray catches it frantically trying to unlocks the cuffs
EXT - WILSHIRE BOULEVARD - MOMENTS LATER

hundreds of feet into the air chewing the street in both
directions from epicenter

TONS OF PAVEMENT go flipping skyward like God’s tiddlywinks

THOUSANDS OF WINDOWS SHATTER up and down Wilshire raining
like snow from all the high-rise office buildings

CARS veer wildly and go spinning out slamming into each other
in an impromptu demolition derby

A BUS flips onto its side skidding in a long stream of sparks
and taking out a bus shelter

keep running dragging Ray along BURNING BULLDOZERS AND
FORKLIFTS come raining out of the sky crashing massively into

EXT -— SUPERMARKET - DAY

Chaos and confusion Wilshire Boulevard is a giant smoking
trench Fire companies are responding from all over the city
with more trucks arriving by the moment

Stitch and Christy limp toward their car They’re battered
bleeding and dark with soot Christy cradles the shotgun

Captain Jonas weaves through the confusion toward then
shouting hysterically

JONAS
Christy I want some goddamn
answers You wanna tell me what
just happened here

CHRISTY
Wilshire Boulevard blew up

STITCH
Trick question right

JONAS
Don’t fuck with me I got a very
pissed off DA in custody who
claims the two of you assaulted him
and ran him through a washing
machine Is that true

CHRISTY
No sir It was a dryer

JONAS
Christy turn in your badge You
and your friend here whoever he
is are both under arrest

STITCH
(to Christy)
How does this work We read each
other our rights

CHRISTY
Begging your pardon Captain but
I’m afraid we can’t right now
There’s something we have to do

JONAS
What What did you say

Christy cocks the shotgun and presses it into Jonas’ belly

CHRISTY
I said nobody’s taking my badge
you dick-face peckerwood Get in
the car

Jonas is flabbergasted Stitch takes his gun and shoves him in
the back of the car cuffing him to the door Christy glances
around -- nobody saw it Too much smoke and confusion

CHRISTY
So much for the pension thing

CHRISTY
(ignoring him)
Jeez look at those storm clouds
Looks like the weatherman was right

Stitch racks the pump starts loading the other shotgun

STITCH
You know for an old fart with his
nerves shot you really kicked some
ass back there

CHRISTY
I did didn’t I

JONAS
Christy Are you listening to me

CUT TO
EXT - DOYLE’S BUILDING - DAY

A vast steel skeleton topped by naked girders straining for the
sky Storm clouds are pouring in fast off the Pacific Distant

FLASHES OF LIGHTNING dance across the ocean ZOOM SLOWLY IN to

reveal THREE FIGURES on one of the middle floors

ON THE BUILDING

Doyle paces Jimmy leans against a girder CLICK-CLACKING a
butterfly knife open and shut open and shut Mary has her
mouth taped and her hands bound Her eyes are terrified
Freezing wind whistles through the structure

DOYLE
Where the hell are they They
should have been back by now

JIMMY
They probably had to pull over for
a lot of fire trucks

They gaze off A column of black smoke rises from the city
Wilshire Boulevard Doyle smiles calming down checks his
watch Impulsively he presses a button -- the watch plays him
an electronic version of Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head

JIMMY
Boss Look

Doyle turns to look Jen stories below Christy’s car rams

the gate into the construction area churning up dust
ON THE GROUND

The car lurches to a stop Stitch and Christy get out gazing
up at the building Jonas is trapped in the car still cuffed

STITCH

This is gonna get dicey Ill go it
alone from here

LCONTTNITEDY

CHRISTY
The hell you will

STITCH
You’ve done your part You’re
staying here

CHRISTY
Let’s flip for it

Stitch considers it He digs a quarter from his pocket and
flips it into the air -- but before he can call it Christy’s

hand shoots out and snatches the quarter He holds it tight in
his fist locks eyes with Stitch

CHRISTY
I call heads

Christy turns the coin in his fingers -- both sides are heads
A con man’s coin He hands it back Stitch shrugs

STITCH
What are we waiting for

THUNDER BOOMS Stitch and Christy both cradling shotguns
march solemnly up the gravel road toward the building

CHRISTY
(without looking back)
Captain You might want to call for
backup

Jonas lunges over the seat grabs the handmike
STITCH AND CHRISTY

walk side by side gazing up as they approach the building
MORE THUNDER Jimmy appears ten stories above them unleashing
a LONG BURST from a high-tech Heckler and Koch assault rifle

Stitch and Christy dive to either side taking shelter behind
construction equipment Bullets chew the ground and SPARK the
machinery Abrupt silence They glance across at each other

CHRISTY
Youre a shit magnet Wherever you
go shit flies in your direction
All I can do is duck

STITCH
Bitch bitch bitch

They burst from cover and run across open ground sending a

fusillade of SHOTGUN FIRE up at the building Bullets chew the
ground around their feet

(CONTTNIEDY

They reach the ground floor level out of the line of fire
The RUMBLE OF A WINCH draws their attention -- the cables of a
construction elevator are being turned by the motor

CHRISTY
They’re going up

ON THE ELEVATOR

Doyle and Mary are riding up in the open cage of a large
platform-style construction elevator passing beams and
girders He has a large 45 automatic pressed to her side A
vicious wind whips their clothing into a frenzy

STITCH AND CHRISTY

jump on the other elevator christy hits the lever They rise
JIMMY

is on a floor somewhere in the middle He looks up at Doyle’s
elevator rising out of sight then glances down at Stitch’s
elevator approaching He takes a step back and fires a burst
into the electrical panel

STITCH AND CHRISTY

stumble as their elevator grinds to a shuddering halt Christy
almost loses his balance and goes over the side but Stitch
grabs his tie and yanks him back

CHRISTY
Thanks

STITCH
Don’t mention it

BULLETS STRAFE the elevator cable above their heads ripping
it to shreds SNAP Stitch and Christy hurl themselves clear
as the elevator drops out from under their feet and hurtles
toward the ground below They land on the building skidding
on their bellies across the floor

SEVERAL STORIES HIGHER

---while Jimmy peers down watching the elevator CRASH far
below He slaps a fresh clip into his HK craning further out
to see where the cops went

STITCH AND CHRISTY

rise slowly looking up Tense and alert expecting anything

CHRISTY
Looks like we climb from here

(CONTTNIUEDY

STITCH
Let‘’s split up Draw his attention
in two different directions

Christy nods
VARIOUS ANGLES - STITCHCHRISTY

They work their separate ways up floor by floor a tense game
of cat-and-mouse among the high girders Climbing ladders
Scaling catwalks Expecting Jimmy to pop up anywhere

CHRISTY
moves cautiously shotgun at the ready

Jimmy suddenly pops into view and FIRES A BURST from his HK
Christy is hit in the arm and spins to the ground Jimny
approaches in no big hurry

JIMMY
Toss it over the side

Christy has no choice He hurls the shotgun over the edge

Stitch suddenly appears above Jimmy aiming his shotgun from a
catwalk on the floor above

STITCH
Drop it

JIMMY
(glances up)
Wrong pal You drop it or I
splatter your partner to the wind
Toss it nice and far

Stitch has no choice -- he tosses the shotgun Jimmy grins
turns back to Christy

JIMMY
Nowlet’s see how high this cop
can bounce

Stitch sees a large open drum of industrial solvent nearby
Quick as a flash he kicks it over -- 50 gallons of highly
flammable solvent cascade down drenching Jimmy He howls in
pain blinking solvent from his eyes Stitch drops down from
the catwalk Jimmy spins to shoot

STITCH
Go ahead pull the trigger Let’s
see what happens when those fumes
ignite I’ve never seen an asshole
explode before

(CONTTNUED

Jimmy hurls the HK over the side Lightning fast he pulls out
his twin butterfly knives CLICK-CLACKS them open and
launches himself at Stitch with a scream of pure animal rage

The fight is brutal vicious Jimmy’s knives slash the air in
a martial-arts blur It’s all Stitch can do to keep from being
gutted like a fish

Jimmy gets him on the ground straddling him with both razor-
sharp knives poised to plunge into his throat Stitch has
Jimmy by the wrists straining to keep the knives away

CHRISTY (0S)
Excuse me

Jimmy glances over his eyes widening in horror Christy is
holding his cigarette lighter near the trail of solvent

The lighter flicks The solvent ignites

Jimmy leaps up and runs screaming in various directionsbut
try as he might to outrun it the flaming trail of solvent
follows him wherever he goes He zigs he zags he goes this
way and that but the fire pursues him closing in

With no place left to go he finally hurls himself off the
building and vanishes

Stitch helps Christy up They hobble to the edge

-and find Jimmy hanging by his fingertips from the end of a
dangling girder suspended from a cable The girder see-saws
Slowly up and down over fifteen stories of empty air

JIMMY
Help me Please

STITCH
What’s the matter Jimmy Losing
your grip
In fact he is His fingertips slip a fraction of an inch
JIMMY
C‘mon pal Get me out of this
I’11 tell you anything I swear

STITCH
There is one thing I’d like to know

JIMMY
Anything Just ask

STITCH
How high do you bounce

Jimmy HOWLS in outrage as he loses his grip In a final act of
defiance he pulls his revolver and FIRES A SHOT -- the muzzje

flash ignites the solvent and he bursts into flame He falls
fifteen stories a human meteor

STITCH
Not very high

Doyle suddenly pivots into view several stories above them
leaning out to the edge of his balance He fires The massive
45 slug blows a hole right through Christy in a spray of blood

Stitch grabs Christy and they hit the floor Stitch drags hin
to safety cradles him in his arms Christy blinks up at hin
stupefied by the pain and shock THUNDER BOOMS

STITCH
Hey partner talk to me

Christy tries to speak Stitch loosens his tie

CHRISTY
Ithurts

STITCH
I’m gonna get you some help You
just hang on

CHRISTY
No time

Christy draws a final shallow breath eyes dancing in pain

CHRISTY
(faint whisper)
The storm The storn

His pupils glaze Dead Stitch throws his head back and
SCREAMS IN RAGE as the heavens illuminate with a FLASH The
rain hits lashing through the structure on gale-force winds

ON THE GROUND

Police cars are streaming into the construction area

ON THE BUILDING

Doyle has his arm around Mary the 45 pressed to her neck
They’re as high as they can go perched on beams and girders
that sway in the wind Wind and rain lashes them violently
threatening to sweep them right off the building

Doyle spins this way and that watching the police cars

converge on the ground far below his world crumbling around
him He’s as dangerous as a cornered rat

FOCOMMTATTO NY

Stitch appears Doyle whirls and FIRES Stitch ducks behind a
beam as the bullet SPANGS off the metal Doyle almost loses

his balance taking Mary with him -- she screams under the
tape covering her mouth -- but he manages to steady himself
STITCH

Doyle Hows it feel to be on top
of the world Have your watch sing
us a song

DOYLE
You son of a bitch You’ve ruined me

STITCH
Don’t think it hasn’t been fun But
it’s over now End of story

Stitch steps into view the dossier of evidence in his hands

STITCH
I think this belongs to you

He tosses it Doyle tries to catch it but the wind snatches
it from his hands -- the papers fly away scattering all over
the city Pointless now Doyle jabs his 45 into Mary’s ribs

DOYLE
I‘1l kill her

STITCH
No you won’t It’s me you want

Doyle’s gun swivels slowly from Mary to Stitch

DOYLE
Yes You

STITCH
A deal Me for her

DOYLE
A worthy bargain

STITCH
I thought you’d like it You can
press that gat in my belly and
look in my eyes when you pull the
trigger

Mary shakes her head wildly Stitch smiles grimly and just
keeps coming He reaches out for Mary and pulls her away He
unties her hands and removes the tape from her mouth
MARY
Stitch--

He puts a finger to her lips

STITCH
Shhh Not a wordMinnie Mouse

He kisses her We read confusion in her eyes and a glimmer of
memory -- what did he call me The storm is right on top of
them charging the air with electrons A rush of static
electricity rushes from his lips to hers A hell of a kiss He
pushes her gently sending her on her way

Stitch turns to Doyle Face to face On top of the world

LIGHTNING BOLTS move closer and closer Stitch looks up
blinking into the rain -- furious charges of of electricity
are building directly overhead A few seconds left Doyle
presses the 45 into stitch’s gut seething with malice

DOYLE
Who are you

Stitch just smiles He begins to glow static charges racing
up and down his body the very air becoming supercharged with
electrical particles Doyle gasps

STITCH
A solid gold dick LA’s finest
(grim smile)
Remember back in ’59 The night you
tossed Lenny the Dwarf down the
elevator shaft I have to go back
there now I have to die

Stitch reaches out and grabs Doyle pulling him close Doyle
cries out in pain as he is grounded to Stitch the electricity
sparking between them bonding then

STITCH
but I’m not going alone

Stitch thrusts an arm toward the sky -- and grabs a vertical
steel rebar An impromptu lightning rod Doyle gazes into his
eyes overwhelmed by horror as he finally recognizes hin

DOYLE
YoU

strikes the rebar -- MASSIVE VOLTA
el conduit flows through Stitch and into
ears in a huge WHITE FLASH --

EXT ROOFTOP - NIGHT - 1959

Zz
io 1A

- and Doyle‘s screaming face appears as he gets yanked into
the past replacing Stitch on the radio relay tower In the

heartbeat of time it takes for the lightning to fry him the
last thing Francis Doyle ever sees is a glimpse of himself and
Jimmy as young men

The lightning dies Abrupt shocking silence

The young gangsters rise gaping in astonishment Aftershocks
of electricity skitter up and down the tower in vaporous
strands then dissipate entirely

The charred tattered corpse hangs from the radio tower
swaying in the wind Franky Doyle stares at the body not
imagining for a moment that he just witnessed his own death

BULL
Oh yuck

DOYLE
Fried him Just like that

They hurry off CAMERA DOLLIES IN on the corpse Once again
we see a charred watch slither off the wrist and drop to the
ground -- it’s Doyle’s the one that played electronic tunes

EXT - LOS ANGELES - DAY - 1999

The storm rages Doyle’s building is a lightning rod in the
landscape drawing overlapping BOLTS from the sky

ON THE BUILDING

Stitch has gone totally unstable from the voltage that has

flowed through him Writhing coils of electricity lift him

into the air Current leaps to the surrounding girders and

back a dancing spiderweb of light Countless images of him
appear each out of sync with the other

Mary is struggling to reach Stitch but the distorted time-
field he’s generating is slowing her down -- it’s like trying
to run in a dream everything getting slow and weird

MARY
Stitch Don’t go Stay with me

STITCH
(screaming distorted)
MMMMMAAAAARRRRYYYY TITTAAAKKKEEE
MMMMMYYYYYYY HHHHHAAAAAANNNNNDDDD

Now the time-field is starting to affect her as well Multiple
images of Mary jitter briefly like ghosts the effect growing
stronger as she nears the vortex

---their fingertips straining toward each other

)

---desperate for that touch

---because it might keep him here

-0r take her with him

Stitch vanishes before they make contact sucked away ina
cosmic vacuum Mary is left alone in the storm lashed by wind
and rain everything back to normal

EXT - ROOFTOP - NIGHT - 1959

Sparks of voltage appear leaping from metal to metal
building in intensity like a Jacob’s ladder run amok creating
a whirlwind vortex

The vortex vanishes Stitch drops from mid-air slamming flat
on his back on the tarpaper He’s back He’s alive

He rolls painfully over sees the smoking corpse on the relay
tower Scattered on the ground at its feet are Stitch’s
discarded badge and gun plus Doyle’s fried watch

Stitch walks over picks up the watch by its charred strap
With its last bit of electronic breath it BEEPS a pathetic
few bars of Beethoven’s Fifth -- duh-duh-duh-dummmm -- and
then fizzles out in a puff of smoke

The moment of truth Realization dawns Maybe there’s still
time Stitch grabs his gun and runs for the stairwell

IN THE STREET

Christy is walking back from the diner with coffee and
doughnuts collar turned up against the drizzle

IN THE ELEVATOR

The gangsters ride the elevator down with the matronly lady
Lenny’s mangled face protrudes from the ceiling

IN THE STAIRWELL

Stitch careens full-tilt down the stairs in near darkness
Crashing into the walls as he takes the landings his descent ©
dizzy and terrifying

IN THE LOBBY

Danny watches the arrow approach the ground floor Christy

appears at the lobby entrance grinning as he shakes water off
his uniforn

CHRISTY
You like sweetrolls sir

Danny looks at him distracted as the elevator stops He turns
back as the gate opens expecting to see Stitch Instead

Doyle and his men are exiting the elevator Realizing there
are cops in the lobby

An eternity passes in the space of a mere heartbeat Then
things explode Fraction-of-a-second events tick out in
agonizing SLOW MOTION as if molasses had been poured into the
very gears and cogs of time itself

THE GANGSTERS go for their guns coats snapping back as
weapons fly free --

DANNY goes for his gun fully aware that he’s a dead man but
drawing anyway face contorting as he screams a pointless
warning to Christy -

CHRISTY frozen in the doorway eyes going wide with
incomprehension and fear -

JIMMY pumping a sawed-off shotgun as he kicks the lady in the
back to propel her into the line of fire --

STITCH bursting into the lobby gun-first smashing the
stairwell door right off its hinges --

DOYLE AND HIS MEN spinning toward Stitch faces going slack
with amazement --

CHRISTY flinging the coffee and doughnuts aside drawing his
sidearm --

STITCH opening fire --

DANNY opening fire --

CHRISTY opening fire --

DOYLE AND HIS MEN are blown back off their feet bullets
chewing through them in clouds of smoke and blood the entire
group sprawling backward into the elevator in a tangle of
bodies Jimmy’s sawed-off goes BOOM at the ceiling bringing
down a chandelier

ON THE ROOFTOP

Doyle’s charred body begins to shimmerand simply winks out
of existence The future in which Doyle becomes a rich and
powerful man who dies in 1999 has been erased

IN THE LOBBY

Silence A haze of cordite smoke hangs in the air along with
the thick coppery smell of blood

The dead gangsters lie heaped in the elevator Lenny the
Dwarf’s mangled face peers down at them making an awful face
The matronly lady sits on the floor crying but unharmed

Danny regards Stitch dourly

DANNY
What the hell took you so long

Stitch is overwhelmed to see his friend alive again He grabs
him in a warm embrace Danny is flustered and surprised

STITCH
Danny You look great

DANNY
Thanks partner You look like shit

Stitch sees Christy having a bad reaction -- the young
rookie’s never seen men die before Stitch hurries over

Christy looks at hin expecting some nasty comment Instead
Stitch throws a comforting steadying arm around hin

STITCH
Take it easy You’1l be all right

Christy is flabbergasted at the affection Stitch suddenly
seems to have for him Stitch smiles

STITCH
You know you’re gonna make a hell
of a cop some day

Stitch and Danny are sipping coffee as the covered bodies of
the gangsters are brought out and loaded into coroner’s vans
Christy sits on the curb nearby a blanket over his shoulders
A car pulls up Captain Thorsen gets out
DANNY
(nudges Stitch)

The Good Humor man

Thorsen approaches looking mean as ever They take a deep
breath ready for anything Thorsen regards them both

THORSEN
Talk about results Damn fine work
both of you There’s gonna be a
commendation from the city in this

Stitch faces Thorsen with a steely gaze

STITCH
You know what you can do with that
commendation
Danny groans inwardly and prepares himself -- this is bound to
be ugly
STITCH

You can include Patrolman Christy
He’s the one who broke this case

Danny and Christy are quietly flabbergasted Thorsen nods

THORSEN
I’ll see to it

Thorsen moves on Danny gives Stitch a look

DANNY
I thought you said you were gonna
pound your notice down his throat

STITCH
What and leave LA

Danny just smiles -- after all these years he should know
better than to take Stitch seriously

STITCH
Face it Danny This city needs us
Always hasalways will
(returns the smile)
See you in the morning partner

He walks away Danny calls after him

DANNY
Need a ride

STITCH
I’ll walk It’s a beautiful night
You can smell the honeysuckle all
the way from the Valley
(inhales deeply)
I love this town Smells like a
cheap hooker

Stitch strolls on into the night as we

DISSOLVE TO

EXT - BEACH - DAY

Pacific Ocean Park stands against a beautiful blue sky ferris
wheel turning TILT DOWN to Stitch and his 4 year-old
goddaughter playing at the edge of the surf having a grand
time tossing a beachball back and forth Danny and Iris are
spreading out a picnic nearby

IRIS

STITCH
On our way C’mon Minnie Mouse

He scoops her up She locks her arms around his neck and gives
him a fierce hug

MINNIE

STITCH
Like I said I’m too old

MINNIE
Wait for me to grow up Promise

Stitch tries to speak but can’t He puts her down and they
walk up the beach hand in hand

MINNTE

Stitch is choked with emotion knowing that he did fall in love
with her forty years from nowin a future that will never be
He shakes his head sadly

STITCH
