PUT YOUR GLASSES ON NOW
EXT HILLTOP -- NIGHT

Pitch black Heaving breath echoes Footsteps pound
Something cuts through the brush

A TEN YEAR-OLD BOY runs full stride cresting the top of the
hill On the valley floor far below hundreds of tiny lights
sparkle in a big circle Something big’s going on down there
The boy charges down the hill desperate to reach the light
EXT TOWN FAIR -- NIGHT

Hazy Dream-like Warped sounds from a time long ago

Booths and exhibits range from Mom’s homemade pies to Army
recruitment A hot-air balloon hovers A SIGN reads

CENTERVILLE WELCOMES FARMERS’ WORLD EXPO 1939

THE BOY passes scarecrows with jack o’lantern heads Apple-
bobbers A pumpkin carving contest Costumed kids

It’s Halloween But the boy doesn’t care
Not looking the boy bumps into a WEASELY PUNK buying cotton
candy This little rat’s got a snot-nosed sneer and enough
oil in his hair to grease a windmill THE WEASEL grabs him
THE WEASEL

Where’s the fire hot rod You

better watch where you’re goin’ if

ya know what’s good for you

A MAN with a MUTTON-CHOP MOUSTACHE who’s running the booth
returns with cotton candy The Weasel releases the boy

THE WEASEL
Ill see you later

The boy runs Weasel gives Mutton-Chop a shiny silver coin
He snatches the candy and stuffs it down Then Mutton-Chop
notices SILVER PAINT on his finger He bites into the coin
It SNAPS IN HALF The coin’s made of wood Mutton is furious

MUTTON-CHOP
You little weasel why I oughtta

But the Weasel just disappears into the fair crowd Laughing
BACK TO THE BOY --

Thunder and lightning as the boy continues through the fair
running to a creepy tent with a clockwork sign

INVENTIONS OF TOMORROW
INT INVENTIONS OF TOMORROW TENT -- THAT MOMENT

Mad science equipment Test tubes Electricity trapped in
glass spheres The boy stops next to a big work table

On it a dirty tarp covers a hulking “body” Suddenly a huge
METAL HAND big enough to crush the boy falls from under the
tarp Startled he tucks it back underneath

And that’s when he’s grabbed from behind by a MAN WITH SCARY
GOGGLES and LAB COAT It seems the boy is done for
Until the man smiles hugging him as only a FATHER would

FATHER
I thought you’d never get back
Did you find it

The boy hands dad a HYBRID TOOL part screwdriver part
wrench all around weird Father pats his son’s head

FATHER
What’s this You feel that

Concerned Father kneels to the boy’s level to investigate
He rubs the back of the boy’s neck examining

Then magically produces a SILVER DOLLAR from the boy’s ear

FATHER
This is an extra special coin son
The only one made of pure silver
The perfect conduit to hold the
spark we need The spark of life

Together they remove the tarp from the hulking shape

A huge shiny ROBOT It’s made from an old suit of armor
refrigerator parts and pneumatic tubing The word “RESCUE”
is painted across its chest with a red and white cross

Father flips the SILVER DOLLAR then opens the robot’s chest
panel He slips the coin inside like it’s a polished heart
The coin conduit connects to different contact heads

FATHER
Let’s find mom She won’t want to
miss this And we don’t want to
miss out her world-famous lemonade

Father leaves The boy’s about to follow when he notices the
robot’s CHEST PANEL hanging open He moves to close it

VOICE (OS)
DONT TOUCH THAT

THE WEASEL stands behind him devouring his cotton candy
WEASEL
You’re gonna break it and I’m gonna
tell on you and you’1ll be sorr-rry

The boy nervously points to a sign at the tent entrance

NO ADMITTANCE BEFORE PUBLIC EXHIBITION FAMILY ONLY
-- DR LAWRENCE SPINGLEMEYER

WEASEL
Aww don’t be a square I just
wanted a little sneak peak at
Doctor Weirdo’s latest invention

The boy slams the chest panel closed darts out of the tent
The Weasel turns back to the robot glaring with cold eyes

EXT TOWN FAIR -- MOMENTS LATER

The boy searches for dad passing the ribbon-cutting THE
GOV hands THE MAYOR a pair of big scissors to kick it off

He goes by another tent where swooning teenage GIRLS watch a
young ARMY CAPTAIN getting an EAGLE BATTALION TATTOO

Then he sees a GYPSY CART A PRETTY FORTUNE TELLER fixes her
make-up She closes her compact beckoning the boy with a
deck of TAROT CARDS Thunder and lightning intensify as
The boy chooses a card He’s about to look at it when
KRR-KRACKK Lightning strikes the hot-air balloon hovering
over the fair IT BURSTS INTO FIRE Flames shoot down the
ropes igniting tents and booths Screams ring out

VOICES (OS)
FIRE SOMEONE HELP US

Out of nowhere Father grabs the boy from behind

FATHER
Come on son weve got work to do

The boy drops the tarot card at the fortune teller’s feet
Her gloved hand picks it up We don’t see the card’s face

INT INVENTIONS OF TOMORROW TENT -- MOMENTS LATER

Father and son scramble to action In all the commotion the
boy doesn’t notice his Father shut the robot’s chest panel

The same panel the boy closed minutes before

The boy inserts the hybrid tool into the Rescue Robot
Together Father and son crank the key Gears whine and hiss

The METAL HAND drops from the tarp clenching into a FIST The
ROBOT slowly rises like Frankenstein’s monster It’s alive
EXT TOWN FAIR -- MOMENTS LATER

Heads turn at the sound of CLANGING FOOTSTEPS A SHADOW falls
over people’s faces Voices scream out in shrieking terror
The Weasel sees it Cotton candy falls from his mouth

The RESCUE ROBOT stomps across the fairgrounds People run
hiding behind booths But the robot passes them by marching
straight into the hot flames

It emerges from the inferno moments later carrying out a
whimpering dog Then it goes right back inside to help

Father watches with awe Beside him the boy trembles in fear
Amazed townspeople watch the robot battle the blaze slowly

realizing there’s nothing to fear A new patch of fire
springs up But the robot’s ready

PEEING on the flames with a strategically placed extinguisher
People cheer wildly The Rescue Robot has saved the day
Before long the fire has died down All that’s left is the
burning hot air balloon still hovering above the fairgrounds

The boy takes a few nervous steps back A pair of loving arms
wrap around him His MOTHER inside the lemonade booth
nudges him back toward his father

Father takes his hand

FATHER
Don’t be scared son Always
remember through any doubt
through any pain through any fear
well find a way
(squeezes the boys hand)
Or well build one

Together hand in hand they turn to watch their creation
The robot grabs the fiery rope and pulls the hot air balloon
down to the ground

Then Something goes wrong Horribly wrong
SPARKS POP from the robot’s chest It twitches goes haywire

The robot HEAVES the fiery balloon into the heart of the fair
Then it charges like a steel rhino smashing anything in its
path The new hero is destroying the Expo

Father rushes to stop it The boy’s helpless as it SWATS dad
like a fly It lifts dad off the ground Dad pulls its chest
open trying to rip out the COIN heart But he’s too late

The robot HURLS father into the LEMONADE STAND The booth
collapses The fiery Expo sign falls down on top of it

And the booth BURSTS INTO FLAMES The boy gazes in horror

Buried by the burning wreckage there’s no way his parents can
make it out alive There’s nothing he can do about it

Then a burst of brilliant flame shoots from the robot’s chest
Then it topples Lifeless The rampage is over but

The entire fair is BURNING A SIGN MELTS before our eyes

CENTERVILLE KANSAS
NEW CULTURAL CENTER OF THE MID-WEST

When the smoke clears the boy is sobbing over the smoldering
wreckage of the lemonade stand Behind him

The Expo has been decimated The entire town’s in an uproar
Children are crying clutching their parents

The boy notices something He picks up dad’s SILVER DOLLAR
from the wreckage and stares at it longingly

The Weasel steps forward with the governor and mayor in tow
Crying he points his finger at the boy

WEASEL
He did it I saw him do it He
was messing with that M-monster

Anger builds Thunder explodes Rain starts to fall
And the whole town turns on the boy A MOB circles him

The ARMY CAPTAIN with the EAGLE BATTALION TATTOO pushes
through the one face in the crowd that’s not furious He
picks up the boy and carries him to safety

Peeking out the boy sees the destruction the mob and
the dead robot Clutching his SILVER DOLLAR he breaks down

DISSOLVE TO
INT MAUSOLEUM -- NIGHT

CLOSE on a pool of water The image of the crying boy plays
atop the murky liquid like a primitive TV

SPLASH An UGLY HAND hits the water disrupting the image
We notice a BLACK CRESCENT MOON BIRTHMARK on the wrist

PULL BACK to find ourselves in a creepy stone burial chamber
lit only by flickering torches The owner of the UGLY HANDS
face hidden by a hood hobbles from the fountain to an ALTAR

The hands deal five TAROT CARDS and an unearthly dark rhyme

UGLY HANDS (0S)
Creatures eternal spirits beyond
Summoned to service by a voice
long gone
The first card turns over The Masked Death
UGLY HANDS (0S)
Five centuries in darkness awaiting
one night Amass the pawns ina
ritual of fright
Three more cards turn The Hammer The Stars The Sword
UGLY HANDS (0S)
Days of man fade black with
Sahw-enn
The Hour of Evil is set to begin
The final card turns The Anvil

Ugly Hands cackles The fountain erupts with BLINDING FLASHES
OF LIGHT On the water’s surface a new image is reflected

It’s the destroyed Expo and the charred hot-air balloon

FLASH TO WHITE
EXT CONSTRUCTION SITE -- MORNING
The old hot-air balloon NOW DECREPIT AND ROTTING sits atop a
dump truck in a pile of trash WORKERS hammer saw and
paint A crane hoists a huge flat screen into the yard
Four more screens are stacked nearby
The giant unlit sign tells us we are at

THE CINCO-RAMA DRIVE-IN

This is a very soon-to-be five screen state-of-the-art
OUTDOOR MULTI-PLEX mecca of movie-going excitement

The parking lot is done The circular stone perimeter wall
adorned by FIVE RAISED PROJECTOR ROOM TURRETS makes the place
look like a fortified castle

An the snack bar newly painted goblin-letters invite all to
ENJOY DELICIOUS MONSTER POP

The theater looks amazing And as soon as the screens are

fastened to the steel frame in the middle of the lot modeled

after The Pentagon the Cinco-Rama Drive-In will be finished

EXT HILLTOP -- MORNING

OBIE TYLER a wiry 10 year-old peers through binoculars in

awe Watching the construction of the DRIVE-IN far below

it’s like he’s watching the pyramids being built

A shrill scream interrupts the moment Obie checks his Famous
Monsters of Film-Land wrist watch 735 AM OCT 29 1959

Obie shoves the binoculars in his backpack which is strapped
with an assortment of tools 3-D glasses slingshot rubber
mallet wooden stakes garlic Normal everyday kid stuff

As he peels off on his bike we can see SOMETHING GREEN
resting on his head but he’s gone before we see what it is

EXT TREE-LINED ROAD -- MOMENTS LATER

Obie’s bike zooms down the hill ripping past an old GRAVEYARD
with crumbling crooked headstones and an old mausoleum

Further along he passes a dingy TIKI BAR that looks like it
hasn’t seen a customer since King Kamehameha was in diapers

EXT OLD VICTORIAN MANSION -- MOMENTS LATER

Steeples of a creepy old house protrude behind a large stone
wall There’s a FAMILY CREST on the rusted gate A dirty
coat of arms bears an ANVIL and ominous lettering

SPINGLEMEYER

Below it a stack of NEWSPAPERS Obie rides by hitting the
skids when he sees The FRONT PAGE The paper nearly jumps
into his hand It shows an artist’s rendering of the Drive-In

OBIE

MELVIN MORLOCK - THE HOLLYWOOD MOVIE MOGUL

A dinosaur ROAR jolts Obie back to reality He leaps into the
bushes as the gate creaks open A THICK BLACK CLOUD emerges
the shape of a CAR barely visible with the smoke

The car door opens A terrifying figure emerges Kaiser
helmet WWII gas mask with hose mouth big welding gloves
Through Obie’s eyes he looks like some kind of SMOG MONSTER

The Smog Monster examines the newspapers stack counting them
That’s when Obie realizes he still has the paper in his hand
The Smog Monster does a re-count Realizes one paper is
MISSING His visored gas mask sweeps the area intently

Obie pulls down the GREEN THING on top of his head It’s a
PLASTIC FRANKENSTEIN MASK The green Franken-face blends with
the shrubs perfectly camouflaging Obie He’s frozen stiff

The Smog Monster’s gaze stops on the bushes Obie gulps down
a bowling ball Does it see him With its eyes covered we
can’t tell but Obie’s about to water the plants

Finally the Smog Monster carries the rest of the papers to
the trunk of its car which we’ll call the SMOG MOBILE

Gears hiss The monster climbs into the driver’s seat The
Smog Mobile chugs down the road wrapped in black smoke As
it passes Obie he spies TWO METAL CANNONS mounted on top

Obie yanks off his mask Exhales Whew That was close
CcuT TO

EXT TOWN SQUARE -- MOMENTS LATER

A giant welcome sign decked with cobwebs and spiders

CENTERVILLE KANSAS
THE GEOGRAPHICAL CENTER OF THE UNITED STATES
POPULATION 3495 WHERE FRIENDS MEET IN THE MIDDLE

Obie zooms into town square It’s Grover’s Corners and
Disneyland’s Main Street rolled into one Smiling citizens
decorate storefronts We may or may not notice that

Sale signs hang in most of the store windows declaring big
savings and the struggling economic times But even that
can’t break the festive mood this morning

The jolly MAYOR FAREWETHER and his SECRETARY hang cobwebs on
Town Hall Beside them the pudgy SHERIFF DUNN props up a
skeleton while his ox-like DEPUTY REDDY unfurls a banner

TOWN HALL MEETING TOMORROW NIGHT

The whole town’s in the Halloween spirit Obie more than
anybody His bike skids out in front of the Mayor

MAYOR FAREWETHER
Ready for the big night Obie

OBIE
My alarm’s set for the stroke of
midnight tomorrow Mayor I’m not
gonna miss one minute of Halloween
And I’m gonna be first in line at
the Grand Opening Spook-Tacular
MAYOR FAREWETHER
Fantastic Don’t forget to bring
your parents and your friends and
anyone else with money to spend
Lord knows our economy needs it

The Sheriff throws his two cents in the conversation

SHERIFF DUNN
Try and keep a lid on all the
monster shenanigans Obie I don’t
need another “walking dead” panic
like you started last year

KA-THOOM A cannon blast scares the crap out of everybody A
neatly-rolled newspaper lands at their feet with a dull SMACK

The smog mobile passes by Obie tenses gripping his
handlebars The Mayor gives the smog mobile the stink-eye

MAYOR FAREWETHER
Can’t we find ourselves a normal
delivery boy for the luv’a Pete
Sounds like Omaha Beach down here

KA-THOOM Another blast sends a rolled paper soaring The
paper smacks the Deputy in the chest landing in his arms

MAYOR FAREWETHER
Can’t you do something

SHERIFF DUNN
No law against delivering the
paper Mayor

MAYOR FAREWETHER
Well there ought to be

KA-THOOM Another paper launches This one banks off a stop
sign ricochets off two cars then lands in the mailman’s bag

EXT TOWN -- MOMENTS LATER

Obie pedals furiously through town but no matter where he goes
the smog mobile scares him at every turn Is it following him

As Obie skids out by THE DINER KA-THOOM A newspaper
launches right at his head But just before it hits WHACK
A BROOM swats it away like it’s a giant fly courtesy of

HAYWOOD THE SODA JERK
Some bad broom-work Obie

Obie bolts Pedals straight into the intersection Right in
front of a PRODUCE TRUCK with a plaster carrot sign on top

BOBBY LEE’S FARM FRESH VITTLES

BOBBY LEE’S angry Texan voice screams from inside

BOBBY LEE (OS)
Tarnation Lupita a rabbit’s only
good for multiplyin’ and crappin’

LUPITA his pretty wife is being yelled at Sobbing she
strokes the PET BUNNY in her lap Obie’s bike cuts them off

LUPITA
Aye dios mio

The truck skids A load of pumpkins falls off splattering
all over the road Bobby Lee leans out the window He’s a
lot older than his wife And he isn’t a Texan he’s Asian

BOBBY LEE WONG

EXT INT TYLER’S TOOLS AND TIDBITS -- MOMENTS LATER
SIGNS hang at the hardware store BIG SALE 25 OFF

Obie dumps his scurries in A KOOK in a leather apron cuts
him off wielding a gut-covered butcher knife Obie screams

The kook spins a pumpkin around to reveal a half-carved jack
o’lantern The guts are pumpkin guts The kook is actually

OBIE’S DAD
Thanks son I wasn’t sure this
pumpkin was scary but now I know

HANDS grab Obie from behind scaring him again

OBIE
No mom please Smog m-m-monst

Obie’s mom TINA TYLER pushes him back toward the door

OBIE’S MOM
Monsters again I don’t wanna hear
it Obie Hustle your doo-dads or
youll be late for school

The smog mobile rumbles outside Obie looks to his dad TIM
TYLER just points his knife at him looking pretty damn scary

OBIE’S DAD
You heard your mother And Obie
sign up for the glee club Get into
some real-world fun for a change

SLAM The door shuts behind him Obie nervously checks the
street The smog mobile has disappeared

EXT SCHOOL YARD -- MOMENTS LATER

Across the playground the smog mobile idles waiting for
Obie It’s a stand-off Obie pedals hard The smog mobile’s
engine revs as they race for the school house

Obie dives for the door making it inside just as-- KA-THOOM
The smog mobile fires a final newspaper It plops on the
school porch We linger on the front page photos of

Movie Mogul MELVIN MORLOCK and Scream Queen FAYE MORGAN
MOVIE SCREEN --

A schlocky horror movie plays in glorious black and white
Faye Morgan shrieks tied to an altar in a binding circle

An UGLY HAG cackles commanding MONSTERS CREEPIES and
CRAWLIES to surround the circle It’s all very AIP

Just then a KNIGHT bursts into the circle Fending off
creatures he slays the hag as she completes her ritual

The set rumbles Phony ground opens Polystyrene rocks
tumble Light spills from the open earth Something crawls
out of the ground Faye shrieks obnoxiously

FAYE MORGAN
Block the portal to the dark realm

The knight removes his helmet He’s not too tough looking
but rather effeminate 50s doo-wop cool in plastic armor

He places the helmet in the binding circle BLOCKING THE
PORTAL-- BOOM A big bang followed by cheesy pyrotechnics
And when the smoke clears

The knight holds Faye in his arms The evil from the portal
is now trapped in his helmet Badly superimposed inside is

A tiny DEVIL with cape trident and Frenchman goatee It
shakes a fist at them The knight tosses the helmet with a
bad one-liner and plants a smakeroo on Faye

THE KNIGHT
Knighty-knight baby

THE END A GALAXY PICTURES LOGO appears with a credit
TRANCE TOWN TRAMP HAS BEEN A MELVIN MORLOCK PRODUCTION
INT CLASS ROOM -- THAT MOMENT

A projector screen rolls up Blinds open The room’s packed
with kids watching the old movie Nobody’s paying attention

Except for Obie Scribbling furiously he’s taking notes

HOW TO KILL MONSTERS
Obie adds a new item to the already long list
EVIL PORTALS BLOCK ’EM

At the head of the class PROFESSOR WELLS the mild mannered
teacher writes on the chalkboard

S A M H A I N

PROF WELLS
SAM HAIN

Obie’s head shoots up on hearing those words Wells
continues We get the feeling this nonsense is beneath him
but he pontificates just to prove how smart he is

PROF WELLS
An age old festival rooted in
creatures and rituals not unlike
the ones you just saw And beware
class for Sam Hain is upon us once
again Today we call it Halloween

Obie’s hand waves wildly The teacher rolls his eyes

PROF WELLS
Yes Obie

OBIE
Youre saying it wrong Professor
It’s pronounced Sahw-enn It means
summer’s end End of the harvest
Also known as the witch’s new year

Wells bristles Nobody corrects him

PROF WELLS
Sam Hain is the night that--

OBIE
People believed the ghosts of those
destined to die in the coming year
would walk the graveyard at
midnight on that night Sahw-enn

Wells sighs at the pronunciation but he plays along

PROF WELLS
The graveyard Where else would
the ghosts of the dead walk Obie

OBIE
Not the dead Those who will die
The ghosts of the living

Silence falls over the class and a pretty petite girl in
the back named MARILYN All eyes and ears

OBIE
They say it’s the day that our
world and the spirit world are
closest together But that’s not
even the scariest part about it

Hushed the Professor leans forward He’s captivated

OBIE
The people from the old world
believed Sahw-enn was the one day a
witch could call upon the devil
himself to help complete a spell

SCOOTER a pint-sized punk in a leather jacket sneers

SCOOTER
So stay out of the graveyard or
youll end up ripe for the lilies
Fream What a crock

OBIE
It’s not a crock it’s called
history Pick up a book for once
and you might know somethin

SCOOTER
Oh yeah I know what else is
history You Right after school

PROF WELLS
Settle down both of you

SPLAT A gooey spitball smacks Obie in the face The entire
class erupts into laughter Only Marilyn looks sympathetic
The Professor grabs Scooter by the ear Yanks him outside

PROF WELLS
That’s it Wazootski Your brother
may have gotten away with murder in
my class but you won’t History
will not repeat here

Obie wipes away the spit SCOOTER’S CRONIES lean in close

SCOOTER CRONY 1
Scared Tyler You should be

SCOOTER CRONY 2
Yeah ‘cuz if Scooter don’t step on
ya’ you know his brother will

This scares Obie He looks like he’s gonna cry Trying to
hold it together he silently contemplates being stepped on

EXT TOWN -- DUSK
The setting sun casts long shadows over town We fly over the
entire community up to the top of old Spook Hill where Obie
was early this morning
On the other side of the hill in the valley below
triumphantly stands the Cinco-Rama Drive-In The workcrew is
raising the second movie screen
EXT HILLTOP -- DUSK
Binoculars lower An OLD GYPSY leers at the crew below
Behind her a FIGURE wearing a ball cap opens an ANCIENT BOOK
The weathered page shows old text and five tarot symbols

The Masked Death The Hammer The Sword The Star The Anvil

THE OLD GYPSY
Thee hour of Eee-vill is near

CUT TO
INT DRIVE-IN -- NIGHT
The crew’s been scrambling tirelessly to get the job done
Over by the concession stand near the big MONSTER POP SIGN
some workers take a break A few of them pass around some

promotional SODA BOTTLES filled with ghoulish green cola

On the far side of the construction yard a JACK O’LANTERN
glows from the window of the site office The door reads

BILTMOORE CONSTRUCTION - BUILD MORE WITH BILTMOORE
INT SITE OFFICE -- THAT MOMENT
ART BILTMOORE the contractor screams into an old telephone

BILTMOORE
DON’T YELL YOU AT ME ABOUT PERMITS
THAT’S NOT MY JOB YOU TAKE THAT
UP WITH THE SHERIFF NO THIS
AINT HOLLYWOOD BUT THE SHOW CAN
GO ON WITHOUT YOU MR MORLOCK

KRACK-BOOM Thunder echoes as Biltmoore slams the phone down
He checks his watch midnight He turns to his calendar

He X’s out calendar number 29 We see today’s date

OCTOBER 30 1959 The countdown’s almost complete The GRAND
OPENING is the night after tomorrow HALLOWEEN

Biltmoore stands to stretch noticing something odd on the
floor he picks it up a TAROT CARD It’s The Hammer

KRACK-BOOM The lights go out The jack o’lantern throws a
shadowy grin on the wall behind Biltmoore He peers out the
window There’s no light in the construction yard either

BILTMOORE
Crap on a cracker

He feels his way to a cabinet and finds a flashlight-- CLICK
The light beam reveals

A GHASTLY CONSTRUCTION WORKER standing silently in the corner
Shrinking skin and a bulging eyeball tell us he’s UNDEAD

FEAR (noun) 1 A distressing emotion aroused by impending
danger evil or pain 2 What Art Biltmoore feels when the
monster in the corner suddenly grabs at him

Biltmoore vaults his desk zooming for the door Opens it
Another gruesome twosome of ZOMBIE WORKERS block his exit

Then the window CRASHES in an explosion of glass Something
else has entered the room It’s huge and has HAIRY FEET WITH
RAZOR CLAWS -- GRRROWL

Biltmoore drops his flashlight in terror storms the door
INT DRIVE-IN -- NIGHT

Biltmoore barrels through the two zombies into the parking
lot It’s too dark to see anything Except for THREE MORE
HIDEOUS SHAPES lumbering towards him in the darkness

Running full tilt he trips over a work bench It’s a
blessing in disguise because Biltmoore finds

A NAIL GUN FSSST-FSSST-FSSST Biltmoore fires it at the
figures Nails soar right past their heads (at us in 3-D)

Continuing his escape he runs through the dark Drive-In
unable to see bumping into things all along the way
Nervously firing off pot-shots with the nail gun

He ducks into a corridor of heavy machinery but the large
CONSTRUCTION CRANE blocks his way He’s cornered himself

Dark shapes of the UNDEAD appear at the corridor entrance
Biltmoore’s trapped and they’re closing in on him

Biltmoore climbs into the crane locking himself in the large
cab He barricades the door with a spare GAS CAN he finds
inside He drops into the seat Exhales Safe

SLAM A green-skinned ZOMBIE WORKER slams against the door’s
glass-- SLAM And another They’re trying to break through

Biltmoore fires the nail gun into the front windshield
Breaks it He climbs out onto the crane’s huge lift arm just
as the creatures break down the door

Biltmoore steadies his aim And shoots the gas can

The cab EXPLODES into flames Biltmoore quickly climbs the
crane’s arm as the fire illuminates the parking lot And we
now see what he bumped into while running away

An army of UNDEAD CONSTRUCTION WORKERS They’re swarming all
over the crane like ants The fire’s glow dying around them

Biltmoore reaches the top of the crane Doesn’t know what to
do But he better think fast because the zombies are
climbing right up after him And they look seriously hungry

Finally Biltmoore finds salvation He sees that the crane is
still attached to one of the large movie screens far below

This is it He has one chance He aims the nail gun sure
and steady at the cab FSSST

And it’s the shot of his life The NAIL strikes the hoist
control lever dead center and flips it into the “ON” position

The crane chugs to life raising the large movie screen
creating a moving platform Biltmoore waiting for it to rise
as the zombies scramble up the crane Almost upon him

About to jump on the platform Biltmoore realizes the worst
The shape of a HULKING WEREWOLF rises into view Silhouetted

in the dark it crouches on the rising platform Biltmoore’s
trick shot with the nail gun has brought the wolf to his door

The werewolf GROWLS leaping straight at Biltmoore (and us)

The nail gun topples off the platform falling for what seems
like forever until it SHATTERS far below The fire dies out

FADE TO BLACK
EXT DRIVE-IN CONSTRUCTION SITE -- MORNING
A dirty boot SLAMS into the dirt It belongs to Art
Biltmoore the contractor He peers around the lot eyes

hidden by SUNGLASSES Eerily calm as if last night never
happened- he’s almost sleepwalking

The construction crew works unnaturally quick And just like
their boss Every last one of them is wearing sunglasses

An ominous BLACK LIMOUSINE rolls slowly touring the Drive-In

EXT INT TYLER’S TOOLS AND TIDBITS -- DAY

Obie’s sweeping up doing chores around the shop for his
parents His dad’s on the phone in the next room Every time
he passes the door we get snippets of his conversation

in the window with a new one CLEARANCE SALE 50 OFF

Obie watches with slumped shoulders He turns his attention
back to the broom but can’t focus on the boring old chores

Obie digs out a Famous Monsters of Filmland Magazine Opens it
to a story on the latest Galaxy Picture by Morlock It reads

Spook Hill Really Obie Just
take the stuff to the front gate
The money will be there for you

As he pushes Obie out the door
OBIE
But it’s almost night time

OBIE’S DAD
Then you better get moving

EXT TYLER’S TOOLS AND TIDBITS -- DAY
Hooking up his bike Obie looks across town to Spook Hill
The OLD SPINGLEMEYER HOUSE looms He flips his mask down

OBIE
“Take the stuff to the gate” Sure
And wait’till he skins you alive

cut TO

EXT OLD VICTORIAN MANSION -- DAY

Obie stops next to the Spinglemeyer mailbox A jar hangs from
a NOOSE on the front gate A wad of dirty old cash inside it
He grabs the jar bolting back to his bike-- THUD

He’s shoved into the dirt A reflector breaks off his bike
Scooter the bully picks up the money jar with a smug grin

SCOOTER
Look-ee here It’s the Fream Im
gonna cream These samoleans

should make up for the four hours I

spent after school yesterday
(leans in close)

S’matter nosebleed you scared of

that house You don’t need’ta be

Youd fit right in with that freak

OBIE
W-w-what are you doing way up here

Obie tries to get up Scooter steps on him mocking him

SCOOTER
L-l-looking for you Someone I
know wants a w-w-word with ya

Scooter wolf-whistles His big brother swaggers over

WHEELS is a greaser who sweats attitude and spits mean
His gang two other greasers named SHOVEL and LOCKJAW are piled
in his chop-top car

The car a black convertible BUZZ BOMB is meaner than all
three of them put together A real rocket from the crypt

Wheels snaps his fingers Shovel tosses him a comb Wheels
slicks up his pompadour offering some doo-wop wisdom to Obie

WHEELS
Careful walkin’ the streets at
night cube It’s dangerous
Like dynamite Ya never know when
stuff’s gonna explode

Wheels picks up Obie’s Frankenstein mask Snickers at it

WHEELS
What is this kindergarten
(to Scooter bored)
You said this was gonna be fun
Start makin’ it worth Wheel’s while
or youre hoofin’ it back home

Wheels “trades” Scooter the mask for the money jar then hops
back in his bomb Scooter takes over gets in Obie’s face

SCOOTER
So you like monsters huh Don’t
‘cha know they ain’t real I know
that ‘cuz I got brains Only real
monster lives inside that gate

Scooter leans in close gripping Obie’s shirt collar tight

SCOOTER
You know he killed his parents

Obie gulps saying nothing He’s terrified

SCOOTER
Maybe he’1ll get you next Fream

ROAR A nasty engine booms on the other side the gate It’s
scary enough to freak out the greasers Scooter gets hasty

SCOOTER
Since you like monsters so much
you should go live with’em

He tosses Obie’s mask and backpack over the wall into the yard
Scooter slugs Obie in the gut then dives into Wheels’s bomb
The greasers tear-off

Trying to catch his breath Obie scrambles as the IRON GATE
slowly creaks open He hides along side it as

A BLACK HEARSE with dark windows blue flames and a chrome
skull on the hood rumbles out It makes the bomb look like a
Matchbox car Obie’s awed It drives off like rolling thunder

Does it mean nobody’s home The gate’s slowly creaking
closed Decision time Obie thinks quick and darts inside

EXT SPINGLEMEYER YARD -- MOMENTS LATER
Obie grabs his mask and backpack His 3-D GLASSES fall out
Nerves calming a bit Obie realizes it’s not so creepy here
after all Nice grass fresh paint a well-kept flower bed
Suddenly something bumps against Obie’s feet He jumps back
A modified MECHANICAL MR POTATO-HEAD walks on robotic feet
trimming the grass with its LAWN SHEAR ARMS Another one digs
at the flower bed And another waters the lawn with a hose
Obie’s fear turns to awe He can’t believe what he’s seeing
There’s a small army of these guys performing all manner of
chores As a sign by the door says they’re the handiwork of
HAROLD SPINGLEMEYER INVENTOR

Obie climbs onto the porch steps on a LOOSE BOARD-- CLACK
He TRIGGERS A MIRROR that locks into place by the door

INT SPINGLEMEYER HOUSE -- THAT MOMENT

Obie’s reflection bounces through a network of mirrors that
CLACK along a system trailing through the house from the
LIVING ROOM to the KITCHEN down some CELLAR STAIRS
IN THE LABORATORY --

A mirror pops out amid a mess of mad science equipment
INTENSE EYES glare at Obie through horn-rimmed glasses

Somebody is watching him
OUT ON THE FRONT PORCH --

The mirror resets back to its original position As it does
it pulls the front door open Obie cautiously eases into

THE GLOOMY FOYER --

OBIE
H-h-hello

His steps kick up dust Nobody’s been in here for awhile
Mechanical sounds come from the next room Obie follows them

IN THE KITCHEN --

It’s like an auto-assembly line Dishes are blasted clean by
a faucet loaded on a conveyor and deposited in the cabinet

Obie finds a door to a dark stairwell GOGGLES WITH GREEN
LENSES hang by it Obie puts them on totally awed by

OBIE
No way

OBIE’S POV-- The green goggles light the way An early version
of night-vision There’s a door at the bottom of the stairs

OUTSIDE IN THE YARD--
Dirty boots stop at Obie’s 3-D glasses A hand picks them up
BACK INSIDE THE LABORATORY --
Obie’s in a converted garagescience lab The green goggles

illuminate an AMAZING WORLD OF SCIENTIFIC WONDER Twisting
liquid coils Bubbling beakers Lightning trapped in spheres

A happy LAB RAT stares at Obie from a cage labeled MARCONI

A car is in the room A NASH RAMBLER with TWO CANNONS on top
It has a huge exhaust A WWII GAS MASK on the hood

This is the SMOG MOBILE A lot less menacing when it’s quiet

Obie checks the trunk An unfolded newspaper rests in a tray
CLACK-FOOSH Two metal arms fold the paper end over end
It’s sucked into a tube and loaded into the launching cannon
A SIGN hangs in the rear window of the smog mobile

HAROLD SPINGLEMEYER PAPERBOY
Obie bumps into a massive workbench where a dirty tarp covers
what can only be described as a large “BODY” He gasps It’s
like he just walked into the morgue

Backing away he notices something on the floor He picks up
an old SILVER DOLLAR And that’s when

A big METAL HAND falls from under the tarp Steadying himself
Obie slowly reaches for the tarp closer

VOICE (OS)
DONT TOUCH THAT

Leaping out of his skin Obie drops the silver dollar
There’s a FIGURE in the doorway HAROLD SPINGLEMEYER Harry turns on the light before Obie can see him clearly
Obie’s green goggle-vision turns blinding white

Obie rips off the goggles momentarily blind Harry dims the
lights so we can’t get a good look at him Obie’s nervous

OBIE
Wwwwhat is this thing

HARRY
Just an old piece of junk

Obie motions to the sign in the car

OBIE
Are you H-H-Harold Spinglemeyer

Harry disappears in the doorway shadow He doesn’t answer

OBIE
I I’m Obie Obie Tyler

Wraith-like Harry quickly throws a tarp over his car and
moves back into shadow

HARRY

You’re the paper thief
OBIE

Umm Borrower actually

Obie digs in his backpack The silver dollar he dropped falls
deep inside Obie offers Harry the paper he took

HARRY
Ain’t news no more kid

Harry grabs a tool Obie glimpses an ugly gnarled saw blade

OBIE
Your machines are totally boss
These goggles are way better than
anything in any HG Wells movie
(holds back a beat then)
I bet if you took these things into
town all the people would think --

CLANG Harry throws the saw on his workbench JOLTING Obie

HARRY

-- that I’m amonster A freak
OBIE

People don’t think that
HARRY

Tell it to the choir kid

Obie’s stuck his foot in his mouth an uncomfortable moment

OBIE

Why don’t you ever come into town
Harry gets mad He charges Obie but stops short of the light

HARRY
Why’d YOU let that bully push you
around outside

OBIE
You saw that

HARRY
You gonna spend your whole life
being a fraidy cat or what Huh

OBIE
I don’t

I don’t know Mister Spinglemeyer

Harry finally reveals his stoic face Square-jawed good
looking he’s not what Obie expected But he’s very angry

HARRY
Mister Spinglemeyer was my father
(moves back into shadow)
-I’m just Harry kid

Obie’s frightened awestruck not sure what to think

INT HARRY’S LIVING ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER

Harry’s at the window watching Obie climb clumsily back over
the wall Harry shakes his head Marconi his rat is on his
shoulder It shakes its head at Obie too Harry pets it

There are packed-boxes scattered all around Harry’s moving
He picks up an old framed photo from the 1930s It depicts A

BOY with his MOTHER and FATHER The same mother and father
that perished at the World Expo Harry’s mom and dad

He tosses the picture into a moving box Slaps the lids shut
EXT HARRY’S HOUSE -- DUSK
Obie leaps over the wall lands by the mailbox and notices

OBIE
Aww man Rat-fink Scooter

His bike is gone Pulling the wagon Obie starts walking
home As he goes we pull back travelling up Spook Hill
past the old tiki bar beyond the gnarled cemetery to

EXT HILLTOP -- DUSK

The Drive-In dominates the valley The crew is raising the
second movie screen The door to the site office SLAMS open
SHERIFF DUNN storms out feathers severely ruffled

SHERIFF DUNN
I don’t care who you are Morlock
youre s’posed to have the building
permits BEFORE the building starts
I’m not signing off on anything

He angrily kicks the tire on Morlock’s limo then jumps into
his police car and zooms off

INT SHERIFF’S CAR EXT NEIGHBORHOOD STREET -- DUSK
Sundown Sheriff Dunn cruises town muttering as he drives
SHERIFF DUNN

Hmmph Go make your little movies

I ain’t losin’ my badge on account--
He spies Obie pulling his wagon home Obie watches the law
man go by Continuing on Obie finds Wheels’s bomb in a
nearby driveway He backs into the street avoiding it
SCREEEACH He’s almost flattened by a beat-up GYPSY TRUCK
trailing the Sheriffs car THE OLD GYPSY sneers from its
passenger seat looking through him Like she knows something

It’s all too much for one day Obie sprints home

INT SHERIFF STATION -- NIGHT

Deputy’s deep in paperwork Sheriff shuffles in exasperated

DEPUTY REDDY
Bad day Sheriff

SHERIFF DUNN

bit’a success little taste’a

DEPUTY REDDY

SHERIFF DUNN
I don’t care how big his pile of
box office receipts is I think
it’s all nothing but a pile of

Ahhh it don’t matter anyway

Something FALLS off of the APB board Sheriff picks it up
It’s a TAROT CARD The Star The Sheriffs puzzled

SHERIFF DUNN
What in the heck

He holds out the card to Reddy you know anything about this

DEPUTY REDDY
Cribbage is my game

That settles that The Sheriff tosses the card aside

SHERIFF DUNN
I’m heading to the diner Maybe
I‘1ll be nice and bring’ya back a
slice of Marie’s rhubarb pie

DEPUTY REDDY
You want to be really nice why
don’t you just bring me back Marie

The Sheriff laughs He reaches for the door knob-- KRASH
A HAIRY CLAWED FIST SMASHES RIGHT THROUGH THE DOOR

Sheriff Dunn flies over his desk into the far wall
The lights go out SOMETHING HUGE enters the station

Deputy Reddy races to the gun case He grabs a SHOTGUN
starts FIRING shells into the dark A shadow descends upon
him In a last gasp he throws the shotgun at THE SHAPE

DEPUTY REDDY (0S)
NNNOOOOCOON

Sheriff Dunn hears the scream Groggy he crawls to his feet

PANIC (noun) 1 A sudden overwhelming fear that produces
hysterical or irrational behavior 2 What can best be
described as what happens when the Sheriff sees

A HULKING MASS of fur and muscle hunched over the Deputy

It’s hard to see but we know it’s the wolf from the drive-in
The Sheriff bolts into the

THE HOLDING AREA --

CLANK Trying to barricade himself in The Sheriff closes a
massive STEEL DOOR that separates the JAIL from the station

SLAM Something hits against the door hard loosening the
hinges-- SLAM It hits again and again

The Sheriff retreats to the end of the row of cells Entering
the last jail cell-- CLANK He locks himself in

CRASH The first steel door gives way A thick BANK OF FOG
rolls through the holding area The cells RATTLE violently

Blinded by fog crippled by fear the Sheriff can only watch
as-- BOOM One by one the jail doors blow off their hinges

BOOM-BOOM Door after door EXPLODES off until the only one
left is his cell The Sheriff backs himself into the corner
collapsing into a ball Waiting

But the final BOOM never comes All is deathly silent

The Sheriff peers intently through the fog at his cell door
And that’s when it comes but NOT from the front

BOOM The cinder block wall behind the Sheriff explodes
Two incredibly strong fur-covered ARMS BURST THROUGH the
stone yanking him out of the cell from behind The Sheriff
is gone in a split-second As the fog settles

DISSOLVE TO

INT OBIE’S HOUSE -- NIGHT
Obie’s watching TV On it Dr Frankenstein works in his lab

OBIE’S MOM
We’re leaving in ten minutes

Obie goes to turn off the TV The movie throws to commercial--
a typical 50’s in-studio starring Faye Morgan

FAYE MORGAN
(on TV bubbly)
Here in Hollywood looks are
everything So I use Glamazon make-
up It goes on natural to cover up
blemishes and minor imperfections
Be glamorous girls Get Glamazon

Faye powders up from her compact Obie clicks off the TV

He heads to his bedroom -- a shrine of monster posters lobby
cards Aurora models and Vault of Horror comics Obie grabs
his jacket tripping over his backpack

The old SILVER DOLLAR falls out Puzzled he picks it up--
KNOCK-KNOCK Somebody’s at the front door

OBIE’S MOM (OS)

Obie opens it his BIKE is there
It’s polished The reflector’s fixed And the bike has been

The lot’s packed The beat up gypsy truck pulls in and kills
its lights The Old Gypsy and her shadowy driver are inside

INSIDE THE GYMNASIUM --
WHACK The Mayor bangs a gavel to start the town meeting

MAYOR FAREWETHER
As you all know the recession has
taken its toll on our town It’s
time for Centerville to dust itself
off and stand back up on its feet

Familiar faces in the crowd Bobby Lee is with Lupita as she
strokes her pet bunny Haywood’s in back with Prof Wells

Obie’s sitting with his parents Oblivious to the financial
woes he’s drooling over MOVIE POSTERS propped-up on stage

Wheels and his gang are on their best behavior because
Sheriff Dunn and Deputy Reddy keep the peace up front
Biltmoore the contractor is next to them All three are

Sitting eerily still And we have to wonder if their DARK
SUNGLASSES are a fashion statement or something more sinister

MAYOR FAREWETHER
Ladies and gentlemen meet the man
who has made it possible Please
welcome Movie Mogul Melvin
Morlock With him Silver Scream
Queen the lovely Faye Morgan

The lights go out Eerie glow illuminates MELVIN MORLOCK and
his arm candy FAYE MORGAN They take center stage prom king
and queen of Sinister High Time hasn’t changed Morlock He’s
still weasly slick addressing the crowd like PT Barnum

MORLOCK
Good People of Centerville--

But he’s cut off Wheels pipes up from the back

WHEELS
So it turns out the dish is datin’
a dish rag What a waste C’mon
boys let’s agitate the gravel

Wheels’s gang leaves Morlock sneers nobody steals his
thunder A beat He recomposes

MORLOCK

Ahh adolescence Is there any
wonder why animals eat their young
Good People Thank you for your
gracious reception Long are the
days since I left my home to seek
my fortune It warms me to know

(snide)
This place hasnt changed a bit

Master showman Morlock feigns sincerity plucking the
heartstrings of the townsfolk like a harp player

MORLOCK
It’s no secret recent years have
not been kind to Centerville--
Stores have been forced to shut
down farms in danger of
foreclosure

Tim Tyler puts an arm around his wife pulls her close to him
Bobby Lee spits out his wheat chaff

MORLOCK
But all that is about to change

OUTSIDE THE GYM --

Harrys sits in his car wearing a set of giant headphones
He points a gizmo that’s half-shotgun half-foil-covered
umbrella at the gym He’s eavesdropping via home-made device

BACK INSIDE --

Morlock strolls to a big poster It’s an artist’s rendering
of the completed Cinco-Rama Drive-In decked out for Halloween

MORLOCK
Tomorrow the Cinco-Rama will open
its doors in spectacular fashion--
a Halloween Festival like nothing
seen before People will come in
droves crossing county lines to be
a part of a historic event
Centerville will regain its place
as cultural center of the Mid-west

The crowd eats it up Applause Cheers ring out As this is
going on Obie notices something out the window

Wheels’s gang They’re up to no-good Obie sees them breaking
into a side-door of the gym Curious he ventures over

BEHIND THE STAGE AREA --
Obie hears voices in the dark hall Follows them

SCOOTER (OS)
Cmon hurry up before they see us

WHEELS (OS)
Quit bein’ such a pansy Nobodys
gonna see nothing Sheesh on what
planet are you my brother

BACK ON STAGE --

MORLOCK
Mayor Farewether in honor of the
celebration please accept my gift-
a surprise contribution to
Centerville’s regrowth Ladies and
gentlemen I give you

Morlock holds up his hand - POOF A magic cloud appears
Inside is a bottle of green soda with a monster on the label

MORLOCK
Monster Pop

Morlock glides effortlessly through the crowd They’re
dumfounded It doesn’t stop him from selling his snake-oil

MORLOCK
Monster Pop bares the official
approval of the featured movie
monster- here we find Jack
O’Lantern in honor of my latest
Galaxy picture But more important
Monster Pop’s taste is fresher than
any other cola on the market
because every Monster Pop is
bottled right when it is ordered

BEHIND THE STAGE AREA --

Obie wanders in on the greasers They’re huddled around some
kind of MECHANIZED BOTTLING MACHINE

The size of a car it consists of a conveyor a black
cauldron pressure cooker bottle racks and a stamping press

LOCKJAW
What is it Wheels

WHEELS
Whatever this thing is it’s gonna
be straight from the fridge when
they start it up and Ka-blammo

Wheels pulls a wrench from his leather jacket He tinkers
with the bottling machine The gang laughs That’s when
Scooter notices

SCOOTER
Hey it’s the Fream

The greasers all turn to find Obie watching them He’s scared
BACK INSIDE THE GYM --
Bobby Lee pipes up from the crowd

BOBBY LEE WONG
One thing Hollywood Why in the
name’a creation’s crap would I buy
a green sody with a critter on it

MORLOCK
Because when you do half the
proceeds go directly to this town
And that means every Monster Pop
sold at every theater nation wide

An awe comes over the crowd Those little green bottles now
seem filled with hope They know what this can mean for them

OUTSIDE THE GYM --

Harry listens Morlock’s words leave a bad taste in his mouth

HARRY
Of all the cockamamy schemes --

WHEEEE Loud FEEDBACK buzzes Harry’s headphones Re-
adjusting his listening gizmo he picks up static then
another conversation

WHEELS (OS)
Listen up Tyler and pay attention
real good

Harry punches a button on his dashboard
Outside the car A PANEL swings open on the door

THUNK A spinning frisbee-like object flies from the car
imbedding itself into the gym wall next to a window

Harry makes some quick adjustments on a control box A
mechanical arm extends holding a tiny mirror Harry controls
it via remote His car’s mirror catches the reflection
Using the mirrors he can now see and hear Obie and “friends”
WHEELS

Youre gonna skedaddle along and

you’re gonna pretend like none of

this ever happened Got it cube

INSIDE - Wheels shoves Obie over into Lockjaw who shoves
him Over into Shovel who shoves him back to

CLICK Wheels flicks open a gleaming switchblade Obie’s
shaking scared to death

SHOVEL
I have to drive my point home

Wheels closes the switchblade Gets right in Obie’s face

change of heart

Wheels motions for his gang to clear a path for Obie The
greasers part like a leather Red Sea Obie’s trembling

INSIDE THE GYM --
The crowd is energized by Morlock’s news Everyone’s excited

PROF WELLS
Let us taste the Monster Pop

MORLOCK
Not until the grand opening lLet’s
not spoil the celebration I want
you all to understand that the
Cinco-Rama Monster Pop the Grand

back to the community that made me
who I am Trust me when I say

Obie nervously leaves the greasers Scooter pipes-up

SCOOTER
Get gone ‘fraidy cat Meow

It strikes a chord deep in Obie remembering what Harry said
OUTSIDE - It also strikes a chord in Harry

HARRY
Oh no kid Not now Don’t do it

INSIDE - The greasers laugh at him Obie grits his teeth

OBIE
I ain’t no ‘fraidy cat

WHEELS
What did you say

OBIE
You punks aren’t gonna ruin the
Halloween festival The town needs
it My dad needs it

Obie’s trembling hand clenches into a fist

OBIE
I ain’t no ‘fraidy cat

Obie shoves Scooter with everything he’s got then sprints for
the door The greasers pounce on him

OUTSIDE - Harry springs from his car sprinting to the window

INSIDE - The greasers grab Obie dragging him to the bottling
machine Struggling furiously Obie breaks free but Wheels
shoves him again He falls back into

The bottling machine Obie SLAMS against a lever turning the
machine on It belches to life Steam chugging and hissing
Gears spinning Conveyors moving It seems alive

A BOTTLE rolls along It’s filled capped and stamped with a
label Eerie green cola glows inside More bottles roll
through filling themselves

OUTSIDE - Harry stops at the window taken aback by the
machine Mass-produced Monster Pop is rolling out

INSIDE - Obie grabs the lever to shut it down It won’t budge--
SNAP The LEVER BREAKS off in his hand Wheels chuckles

WHEELS
Who ruined Halloween now chump

The greasers flee leaving Obie with the haywire machine He
frantically tries to shut it down but it just gets faster and
faster shaking even harder FOOM-FOOM-FOOM

Monster Pop bottles launch like missiles from the machine

KRASH One goes through the window
Harry ducks as it nearly takes his face off

Finally the machine’s pressure cooker BLOWS The force of
the blast KNOCKS the wheel-blocks from under its platform
The machine LURCHES forward

Obie tries to stop it from rolling but it’s far too heavy
SLAMMING into him he buckles forward onto the machine

Obie’s riding atop the rolling machine Sounds warp Gears
wind down with a grinding CRUNCH The machine rolls onto

THE STAGE --

When the smoke clears Obie’s in the middle of the town
meeting sprawled on top of the BROKEN BOTTLING MACHINE

OBIE’S DAD
My god Obie what have you done

Obie’s dad His mom The Mayor Bobby Lee The entire
crowd from the town meeting They’re all staring at him

Morlock gives Faye a look of almost-panic She shrugs it off
with a bubbly smile don’t look at me Im the talent

The Mayor steps forward disgusted with Obie

MAYOR FAREWETHER
You you the Spook-Tacular
it’s doomed

BOBBY LEE
It’s all yer fault Tyler If
pidgeons had yer brains they’d all
be flyin’ backwards

OBIE
It wasn’t me I-I didn’t do it

He tries to defend himself but the busted machine and the
broken lever in his hand tells another tale

OBIE’S MOM
No more stories Obie

Anger builds in the crowd The whole town turns on the boy
For Harry at the window it’s an all-too familiar scene The
hammer’s about to drop on Obie And he knows how it feels

HAYWOOD THE SODA JERK
That’s some real sour soda Obie

PROF WELLS
What are we gonna do This was our
last chance You killed it Obie
Youve ruined everything

The mob crowds around him Obie stares at the angry eyes
looking back at him Tears welling up in his own eyes

MAYOR FAREWETHER
Who are we ever going to get to fix
this mess

VOICE (OS)
Me

The crowd parts Gasps heard all around A stoic but angry
figure pushes his way to the front of the room It’s

Harry Spinglemeyer Standing in front of the townspeople
this is the closest he’s been to them in twenty years

Leave the boy alone I can fix

EXT CENTERVILLE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL -- NIGHT

Harry rigs the bottling machine trailer to his car
Townspeople watch cautiously keeping their distance He can
hear them whispering over the sound of the chains and rachets

Theyre all staring As he works Harry notices a NEW FACE in
the crowd A pretty sandy-haired YOUNG WOMAN (20s)
Eventually we’ll know her as AGGIE but not right now

Just because she wears no make-up and even though she’s not a
bombshell like Faye doesn’t mean Aggie’s any less beautiful

She makes eye contact And Harry notices it big time Then
she disappears in the crowd Harry continues with the trailer

The Mayor stands by Harry coldly It’s awkwardly silent
All that’s heard is the sound of chains and ratchets until

HARRY
Once it’s fixed I’ll be gone For
good I’1l drop it off on my way
out of town Then I’m no longer
your problem You won’t be mine
either Fair enough

The Mayor nods apprehensively Before he can say anything
someone emerges from the crowd strolls over in grand fashion

MORLOCK
Harry Spinglemeyer My dear old
friend It’s been far too long

Harry glares right through him If looks could kill Morlock
would be dead three times Morlock offers his hand There’s
a BLACK CRESCENT MOON birthmark above his cuff

MOROLOCK
Come now Harry One simple
handshake isn’t going to kill you

Harry ignores it Morlock seems hurt but nods understanding

MORLOCK
I can’t say I blame you I know
this town has never treated you the
same since “that night”

Morlock’s words sear into Harry

MORLOCK
But here we have a chance to make
all those hard feelings go away

HARRY
How ‘bout I keep the hard feelings
and you just go away

The LIMO rolls up It dwarfs Harry’s car Inside Harry
notices Faye giving him the once over He just dismisses it
Faye bites her lip glaring pure fire

MORLOCK
Harry don’t be petty Every man
deserves a chance to redeem
himself You’re helping the town
after all Perhaps the Halloween
Festival holds a chance for old
wounds to finally heal

HARRY
Happy to disappoint you Melvin

Harry gets in his car and fires it up

MORLOCK
Then why are you doing this

Harry looks over and sees Obie watching him Morlock notices
He smiles Harry’s just tipped his hand He can’t hide it

MORLOCK
Funny I never took you for the
sentimental type

Harry grits his teeth and starts to pull away Obie breaks
from the crowd runs up to Harry’s window

OBIE
Harry wait

HARRY
Bug off kid the volunteer
center’s closed for the night

OBIE
Please don’t go Just come talk
to everybody It’ll be ok They
don’t understand you the way I do

HARRY
They don’t want to understand me
kid And that door goes both ways

Obie spits out a breath Defeated But he soldiers on

OBIE
I know you wanna help people
That’s why you fix stuff To help
Like my bike You fixed my bike
(off Harry’s look)
Maybe you just wanted to help me

Harry doesn’t answer

OBIE
But they need your help too
(beat)
How are you ever gonna help people
if you don’t even get to know’em

This rubs Harry raw Growling in anger he lies to the boy

HARRY
I’m not doing this for anybody
Not you not them I’m doing this
for me So I can leave this place
That’s all I want Obie To be
left alone So do me a favor huh

Harry nods for Obie to step back from the car Obie stares at
Harry disappointed then takes a slow step back eyes down

HARRY
Oh and about the bike

Harry flips the “PAPERBOY” sign in his window so it now reads
HAROLD SPINGLEMEYER HANDYMAN

HARRY
I’1ll send you a bill

He drives off towing the bottling machine With a sigh Obie
watches Harry disappear A beat His Mom and Dad approach

OBIE’S MOM
I don’t know what’s gotten into
you Obie but if it doesn’t stop
now you’re going to regret it
Obie doesn’t know what to say His dad does

Obie uncaps the bottle of Monster Pop dying for a sip But
just as the bottle is about to touch his lips

PROF WELLS (0S)
What are you doing Tyler

Out of nowhere Wells angrily grabs the bottle from Obie

PROF WELLS
I know you heard Morlock Nobody’s
supposed to have this Now scuttle
off or it’s a week’s detention

Obie complies walking away The Professor eyes the Monster
Pop bottle thirstily He doesn’t want to ruin the show but

PROF WELLS
---just one little sip wont hurt

Prof Wells feverishly drinks down the Monster Pop Licking
his lips he savors the flavor then grimaces in disgust

PROF WELLS
Yecchh this is horrib-- Agghhh

Before he can finish the words SEVERE CRAMPS set in He
clutches his stomach in horrible pain Drops the bottle

SMASH Obie spins Wells is doubled-over Shaking violently
Contorting like he’s going to be sick Obie runs to his side

OBIE
Professor Are you okay

The Prof’s only answer is a painful groan He turns green
Behind them the BLACK LIMO silently rolls to a stop Obie’s
too concerned to notice The Prof’s getting worse

OBIE
I’m gonna get you some help

Suddenly Obie and The Prof are blasted by the limo’s
headlights A hand grabs Obie turning him away from Wells

MORLOCK
Perhaps I may be of assistance

Even though Morlock’s blasted by the light he’s still in
shadow A skinny shaft of light streaks his eyes like Lugosi
in Dracula If Obie wasn’t freaked out before he is now

MORLOCK
Such a curious little boy
You know what curiosity did to the
kitty don’t you

Obie nods nervously All attention focused on Morlock Obie
doesn’t see what is happening behind him but we do

The Prof’s SKULL EXPANDS as an OVER-SIZED BRAIN grows out of
the top of his head His EYES BULGE as BLACK and as big as
eight-balls His mouth curls into an ever-silent groan His
hands transform into huge green crab-like PINCHERS

The Monster Pop has changed The Prof into a creature similar
to the Metaluna Bug Mutants of This Island Earth

The zombie-like Sheriff and Deputy appear at the Mutant Prof’s
side They silently wrangle him off into the shadows as
Morlock stands beside the still-unaware Obie

OBIE
The Professor’s sick I need to--
MORLOCK
Come now The Professor is fine
Morlock spins Obie around to see The Prof is gone
MORLOCK

An over-active imagination can be a
master of trickery in the dark
especially around Halloween Are
you sure you saw what you said you
saw Or what you think you saw

OBIE
I know what I saw

MORLOCK
Perhaps you should come with me

Morlock motions to the limo The door opens by itself Obie
looks at Morlock His gaze is hypnotic Obie’s getting
sleepy But before anything else happens he’s saved by

OBIE’S DAD
Son I told you to wait in the car
Sorry Mr Morlock I hope Obie’s
not bothering you

Morlock turns on the charm

MORLOCK
None at all Who could be bothered
by the spirit of our youth Always
eager to grasp the bigger picture

OBIE’S MOM
Come on Obie Let’s get going

Groggy Obie turns toward his parents As he does
MORLOCK
Obie if you’re anxious for a
little excitement
Morlock whips out a BIG TICKET to the grand opening
MORLOCK
See the show
If you think you can survive
HA-HA-HA-HA-AHA-AHA-AHA-AHA-AHA
OBIE POV-- Morlock holds the ticket his hypnotic eyes
burning in the background Everything warps into a dizzying
spiral as Obie is lulled to sleep
FADE TO BLACK
INT OBIE’S BEDROOM -- NIGHT

Obie snaps from a deep sleep Morlock’s ticket is on his
dresser As he moves to get it he passes the window sees

OUTSIDE -- The Sheriff and Deputy are standing in the street
Sunglasses on they stare eerily up at his window

Obie rubs his eyes checking the window again It’s safe
Nobody outside Must be seeing things Rolling back over
into bed Obie catches a reflection in his dresser mirror

JOLT The Sheriffs and Deputy’s LARGE FACES are pressed
right against his window staring inside Obie bolts for

THE HALLWAY --

Obie skids to a halt halfway to his parents’ room There at
the other end of the hall right in front of their door is

The Mutant Professor

Lumbering slowly in the dark the Mutant Prof turns toward his
parents’ room Drawn by Tim Tyler’s overly-loud snoring

His parents are helpless Obie quickly finds his slingshot
Aims WHIZZZ-- a MARBLE soars harmlessly past the Mutant

Steadying his trembling hands Obie lines up another
HORRIBLE SHOT He misses Obie abandons the slingshot for a

A BOOK on a nearby shelf He throws it
The book BONKS off the creature’s big bulbous brain The
Mutant Prof turns just in time as Obie fires another book

And catches it in it’s giant pincher claw

Martians Go Home by Frederic Brown With a quick SNAP of its
mighty pincher The Mutant Prof rips the book in two

The terrified look on Obie’s face says he might need some new
underwear

OBIE
Uh oh ummm not a big sci-fi
fan I guess

Leaving his parents alone the Mutant Prof lumbers down the
hall after Obie once again Obie runs into

THE LIVING ROOM --

Obie skids into the dark room trying to catch his breath
The Mutant Prof’s shadow looms closer to the doorway Obie
squeezes in back of the TELEVISION SET for a peek outside

OUTSIDE -- Obie sees the Deputy down the side of the house
He’s still peering into his bedroom window silent and still

Obie strains against the window screen trying to find

JOLT And that’s when the Sheriff’s face appears right in
front of him He punches through the window screen

Obie backs away in terror The Sheriff’s arm flails at the
window but he can’t get in That doesn’t stop the Sheriff

He grabs a bottle of MONSTER POP tucked inside his holster
Reaches in the window and

--pours the bottle of Monster Pop all over the television

FZZZT The TV flickers to life On screen the monster
classic 20000000 Miles to Earth is playing The giant
monster Ymir struggles to free himself from a cage

Suddenly the THING’S MAMMOTH ARM grows out of the TV into
Obie’s living room The huge Thing is crawling from the
television into real life Obie tries to get a grip

The Thing gets its head shoulders and other arm out of the
TV but its waist gets stuck The Thing roars crawling toward
Obie Half-way out it drags the television behind it

Obie thinks fast He pulls the plug Sparks fly But it
doesn’t stop the monster In fact it seems to piss it off

Thats precisely when the Mutant Prof’s pincher SNAPS for
Obie’s neck barely missing as Obie drops ducking to safety
Obie scrambles out a side window The two creatures follow

EXT OBIE’S HOUSE -- NIGHT

Dusting himself off Obie sees the Sheriff’s car leaving
That’s one problem gone but Obie still has to deal with the
Mutant Prof and the Thing from the TV it sicced on him

Obie leaps the back yard gate
INT TOOL SHED -- MOMENTS LATER

The door CRASHES open Thinking on his feet Obie grabs
A ROPE An AXE hanging on the wall And Dad’s RUBBER BOOTS

EXT BACK YARD -- THAT MOMENT

Obie ties the rope to something on the side of the shed He
sees The Mutant Prof at the back gate The flickering light
behind it says the Thing from the TV is close

Obie steps into the large boots End of the rope in one hand
axe in the other he awkwardly marches out to the middle of
the grass a junior-league back yard monster fighter

And a very scared one at that He’s shaking horribly

OBIE
Cmon Come and get me

The Mutant Prof stops at the edge of the grass Looks at him

OBIE
(sotto)

Don’t be fraidy cat Don’t be
(terrified to the Mutant)
What’sa matter You scared of me
I’m just an ankle-biter and you’re

a big old monster Come get me

The Mutant Prof stares at Obie Then the grass Gears in his
big brain turning it’s trying to figure out what he’s up to

OBIE
You’re mom has a hairy eye-ball

That did it The Mutant Prof’s mouth curls in anger He
stomps toward Obie Behind him the Thing from the TV drags
the television ENTERING THE BACK GATE

Shaking in fear Obie steadies The Mutant Prof gets closer

OBIE
A little moreCome onAlmost

The Mutant Prof raises its big pincher right on top of Obie
And then we see what Obie’s been waiting for

The Thing from the TV drags itself on to the lawn Obie yanks
the rope with all he’s got It’s tied to

The lawn sprinklers They explode to life - FZ2ZZT The TV
SURGES with electricity Shocks course across the grass into
the Mutant Prof’s feet up his body into his bulbous brain
Obie’s feet stand firm protected by the RUBBER BOOTS

The Mutant Prof topples crashing to the ground like a tree in
the woods The TV fizzles out taking the Thing with it

Obie nudges the Mutant Prof with his foot Out cold He
checks the TV It sparks to life again a hand emerging

CRASH Obie swings the axe killing his television
INT HALLWAY -- MOMENTS LATER

Back in the house Obie looks out the window The Mutant Prof
lies sprawled on the grass next to the busted television

Obie turns to his parents’ doorway watching them sleep as he
contemplates his decision How’s he gonna explain this to
them He turns practicing his lines to them in the mirror

OBIE
(sotto)
Mom Dad there’s a monster in the
back yard No Wake up

There’s something on the lawn you
need to see It came from the
televison No that’s not it

Obie checks the window again The Mutant Prof is gone All
that’s there is the broken television Obie rubs his face
Great He turns back to his sleeping parents

OBIE
Sorry but somebody needs to figure
out what the heck’s going on And
I’m the only somebody for the job

EXT OBIE’S HOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER
Obie wheels his bike from around the side of the house
EXT TOWN SQUARE -- NIGHT

Obie rides through the empty streets The wholesome ‘50s town
square is dark and deserted Obie knows there’s evil lurking
in the night He drops his bike dives into a bush just as

Morlock’s ominous limo turns a corner
Obie sees it cruise town then leave He gets on his bike
following the limo Past the welcome sign Out of town

cut TO
EXT SPOOK HILL ROAD -- NIGHT

Dark Lonely Skin-crawlin’ creepy Obie pedals the only
light coming from the limo fifty yards ahead of him They are
the only signs of life for miles

And then the limo peels off Fast Disappearing into the
night it leaves Obie alone in the dark He can barely see a
thing Obie starts to panic but only for a moment because

VRROOM Headlights roar around the corner straight at Obie

It’s WHEELS’S BUZZ BOMB Caught in its path Obie turns and
pedals like hell But the bomb’s barreling too fast It pulls
alongside Obie Shovel and Lockjaw hoot and holler in back

As he drives Wheels reaches over and grabs Obie’s handlebars

WHEELS
What’s buzzin’ cuzzin’

OBIE
(struggles to break free)
Please I didn’t say anything

WHEELS
I’1l put that on your tombstone

VRROOM Wheels gives it gas The bomb hits break-neck speed
taking Obie with it His handlebars rattle like a jack-hammer

OBIE
PLEASE SLOW DOWN PLEASE

WHEELS
You hear that boys we got us a
real safety-first Clyde here

The greasers laugh like jackasses They won’t let up Obie
doesn’t know what to do He quickly whips out his slingshot
FOOM He fires a horrible shot

The shot goes wide banking off Lockjaw’s flask and CRACKS
Wheels’s rearview mirror Wheels turns ten shades of pissed

WHEELS
Oh you’re dead Spaz Wheels is
gonna teach ya what happens when
you whizz on a Wazootski

Wheels releases Obie’s bike and slams on his brakes The bike
shoots ahead of the bomb Obie fighting for control Then

WHEELS
Time for a 1i’l follow the leader

VRROOM Twin flames blast from the bomb as Wheels floors it
The bomb blazes after Obie He’s about to get flattened

Obie presses a button on the BULLY BUSTER control box

BOOM-FSSSSST A SMOKE-SCREEN spews from his bike with a loud
backfire It blankets the highway in a thick fog

Wheels gets lost in the haze He SLAMS the gas pedal down
Obie cuts his handle bars hard His bike swerves out of the

way just as the bomb bursts through the smoke cloud behind it
Wheels flies right by tearing up the highway a quarter mile

The bomb busts a 180 skid heading straight for Obie
It’s now a fierce chicken match between car and bicycle

The bomb rockets past the bike narrowly missing Obie
Grazed Obie almost falls but manages to hold on

Wheels spins his suicide knob flipping a another U-turn
WHEELS
Hey Shovel I think sleepy hollow’s
a little cold Throw him a heater

Shovel pours his flask over a jack o’lantern then sets it on
fire He winds up ready to throw the FLAMING PUMPKIN at Obie

Obie pedals futilely The greasers are right on top of him

KA-BLAMM A rolled newspaper SMACKS Shovel BLASTING him into
the backseat The fiery pumpkin smashes to the road

Wheels swerves In the backseat Shovel groggily crawls up

SHOVEL
Cream that creep

KA-BLAMM He takes a newspaper in the face and goes down

KA-BLAMM Another newspaper SLAMS against the bomb’s front
windshield spider-webbing the glass

Obie looks back to see Wheels dropping off his tail
CHUG-CHUG Obie hears a weird noise He looks up to see

He’s riding into a huge CHUGGING SMOG CLOUD A MECHANICAL
ARM safely lifts him off his bike and places him in the
seat next to HARRY who wears a fedora and gas mask Obie
sits in the now-convertible smog mobile

IN THE SMOG MOBILE-- Harry hits a couple buttons A rod
snakes out the side locking Obie’s bike to the car The
convertible roof snaps back down Harry guns his engine

IN THE BOMB-- Wheels spots the smog mobile through the cloud
in front of him and swerves out of the way Now he’s pissed

WHEELS
Nobody makes Wheels chicken out

Wheels punches it He roars right by the smog mobile and flips
around like a lightning bolt It’s now a full-on chicken match

between Wheels and Harry And neither is slowing down

IN THE SMOG MOBILE-- Harry scans his dashboard Obie’s eyes
are wide in fear as the bomb approaches Harry spots
something on the side of the highway it’s Bobby Lee’s farm

HARRY
Hang on

IN THE BOMB-- Wheels sneers as he pushes pedal to the metal
The two cars scream toward each other head on

IN THE SMOG MOBILE-- Harry dials up his air pressure The
needle red-lines He grabs a control stick adjusts the aim

The roof cannons aim down at the street On the dash a red
button FLASHES Obie notices it sweating profusely Outside
Wheels is right on top of them his headlights blinding them

HARRY
When I say now you punch it-- NOW

Obie slaps the button

ON THE HIGHWAY-- The two cars are about to CRUNCH together
when - KA-BLAM Harry’s roof-top cannons explode

The force of the BLAST PROPELS THE SMOG MOBILE into the air
It soars right over Wheels’s bomb The greasers look up at
the undercarriage of Harry’s car as it flies by

IN THE SMOG MOBILE-- Harry quickly hits another button as the
car soars It’s labeled “OIL CHANGE”

ON THE HIGHWAY-- The smog mobile begins its automated self-
service operation DUMPING all the oil in its engine
Right on top of Wheels and his gang

WHEELS
WHAT THE-- AAAAAAHHH

Wheels loses control He spins out into a wooden fence then
SMASHES into a chicken coop When the dust clears we see

The greasers have been tarred and feathered

Harry’s car automatically replenishes its oil reserve as it
hits the ground Then 180 skids to a stop The door opens

Harry steps out in gas mask and hat The greaser-chickens
recover their senses and hop out too Wheels is fuming

SHOVEL
(spitting out feathers)
Yo’ Wheels look it’s it’s-—-

WHEELS
The paper freak
(explodes at Harry)
WASN’T NONE OF YOUR BEES-WAX
CREEPSHOW I HAD BEEF WITH THE KID

HARRY
(distorted mask echo)
Then you got beef with me

KA-BLAM KA-BLAM BLASTS from the smog mobile rain newspaper
rockets on the Greasers They dive into the bomb for cover

WHEELS
YOU AINT SEEN THE LAST OF US YOU
FREAKS I’M GONNA BREAK YOUR HEADS
LIKE I BROKE THAT BOTTLING MACHINE
And on that note the ominous black limo rolls silently out of
the dark Nobody notices it lurking in the background behind
the bomb A beat later
Wheels peels out the limo following the bomb in the dark
CcuT TO
INT HARRY’S CAR -- MOMENTS LATER

It’s an awkwardly silent drive Obie nervously looks to
Harry Breath still echoing Harry pulls off his gas mask

HARRY
You all right

OBIE
Why Is this goin’ on my bill

Harry almost smirks

OBIE
Thanks

HARRY
Just answer me one question What
the heck are you doing way out here
in the middle of the night

OBIE
Forget it You’d never believe me

HARRY
Oh yeah why don’t you try me

EXT HILLTOP -- NIGHT

Harrys car is on top of Spook Hill overlooking the Drive-In
Far below the crew raises the third screen Harry stares
down at it scratching his head No easy way to say it

HARRY
Look you seem like you’re a pretty
smart kid but--

OBIE
-But you think I’m totally nuts
(off Harry’s silence)
See I knew you wouldn’t believe
me I’m not making it up Harry

HARRY
Obie Morlock’s not turning people
into monsters He’s just playin’
on this town’s emotions by using a
low rent holiday to line his fat
pockets He wants to sell tickets

OBIE
I don’t like him He scares me

HARRY
Scares you

OBIE
There’s just something really weird
about him I think it’s boss that
he’s master of the monsters and all
- Creature Walks Among Us Beast
from Haunted Sea Jack O Lantern -
specially since he only used to
make stupid surf movies but

Obie digs in his backpack He pulls out a Famous Monsters of
Film-land magazine Morlock’s on the cover Headline

KING OF THE MONSTERS

OBIE
--Then he disappeared

Obie flips the magazine to a big article Morlock movie
posters and a panoramic shot of Death Valley Headline

THEY CAME FROM THE DESERT

HARRY
Yeah yeah Lost on a desert
shoot some prospector found him
months later It’s all hype kid

OBIE

Somethin’ happened to him in that
desert Right when he came back
he made his very first monster
movie Trance Town Tramp We saw
it in my class it was so boss
There was a witch who tried to put
a spell on an entire town with
these little bottles of po-- WHOA

(he does the math)
--What if its real

HARRY
Rriiight Ya ask me shoulda left
him in the desert for the buzzards

OBIE
But Harry --

HARRY
But nothing Your brain’s on

Harry gets in and fires his car up Obie climbs in after him
shoulders slumped in disappointment

EXT TIKI BAR PARKING LOT -- NIGHT
Torches burn at the abandoned tiki bar on Spook Hill Harry’s
car pulls up Obie gets out intrigued when he spots a BLACK
HEARSE with flames and skull the one he saw at Harry’s house

OBIE
What is this place

Harry straps on his tool belt as he leads Obie into the bar
They don’t notice the Gypsy Truck passing the parking lot
The Old Gypsy watches them intently

INT ALOHA JOE’S DARK CONTINENT -- MOMENTS LATER

Spooky Moody African drums play Torches cast long shadows
over hanging grass palm leaves and WWII trophies from
Guadalcanal Harry and Obie are alone until

Two SHRUNKEN HEADS are thrust right in their faces

DEEP VOICE (0S)
BOOGA BOOGA BOOGA

ALOHA JOE tucks the heads on his belt A retired US Army Capt
in a bad Hawaiian shirt Joe speaks low like an undertaker

ALOHA JOE
Evenin’ Harry Gotcha didn’t I

Harry rolls his eyes Joe shrugs

HARRY

most preternatural barkeep east

of the Pacific Rim

ALOHA JOE
You know the rules Harry No kids

(smiles at Obie)
The last one never left Ha-ha

HARRY
Funny Want the pump fixed or not

Joe shakes Obie’s hand Obie sees an old EAGLE BATTALION
TATTOO on Joe’s arm -- the same tattoo he got the night
Harry’s parents died the night he took Harry under his wing

INT ALOHA JOE’S DARK CONTINENT -- LATER

Harry’s tinkering with the soda pump under the bar Obie’s
sipping a flaming shake Joe intensely regales Obie with
tales from his days on the Dark Continent

ALOHA JOE
Twelve thousand of the Emperor’s
Elite all sharpening their swords
My entire brigade- our Watusi
guides- wiped clean It was just me
and the witch-doctor
From nowhere there came’a laughin’
like no laugh my ears had ever
heard Real evil Real creepy
Echoing behind the witch-doctor’s
mask This mask

Joe pulls a shroud of leopard skin from above the bar Unwraps
it Inside is an ornate cackling-faced ZULU DEATH MASK

ALOHA JOE
He knew they never had a chance

Just then Lupita Bobby Lee’s wife enters the bar She
takes a seat stifling sobs as she carries her pet bunny

ALOHA JOE
Here Obie talk to my friends

Joe leaves his shrunken heads and Zulu Death Mask with Obie as
he tends to Lupita Harry comes up from under the bar

HARRY
Wish I’d met you sooner I wouldn’t
have had to listen to Joe ramble on
all these years

Harry places an assortment of nozzles and fittings on the bar

OBIE
What are those

HARRY
Pieces from Joe’s pump I’1l use’em
on that stupid bottling machine

Obie looks grave at the thought

OBIE
Don’t fix it Harry Please

HARRY
Are you nuts Those people hate my
guts If I don’t fix it you may
as well feed me to them

OBIE
If you do fix it we’re all gonna
be food for something way worse

Harry silences Obie with a stern look He’s about to respond
when he’s interrupted by an explosion of sobs from Lupita

OBIE
What’sa matter Mrs Wong

LUPITA
(she holds up her bunny)
Mi poor Conejolito

HARRY
Bobby Lee wants to get rid of it

Lupita SNUGGLES to Harry Joe winks Harry glares cut it out

LUPITA
Bobby Lee is muy malo He wants a
perro I scared of perros because
they bite me Jou see look--

Lupita lifts her skirt showing a tiny scar below her butt

HARRY
Easy lady You’re a fire hazard

ALOHA JOE
(re the bunny)
Lemme see that little critter

Joe pulls out a DUSTY SKULL flips open the cap and sprinkles
hot pink VOODOO POWDER on the bunny

ALOHA JOE
Watango

The lights in the bar flicker Are we crazy or Is something
happening to the bunny A beat later everything’s normal
The bunny stares back at them business as usual

HARRY
Nice try Houdini but you can’t
spell believe without “lie” The

sooner you two realize that the
sooner I can get gone from here

OBIE
Lay it on Joe See if he thinks I’m
on the level about Morlock or the--

HARRY
Enough There’s about as much
goin’ on there as there is with
Joes phony-baloney powder and
this rotten old hunk of wood
Harry grabs the Zulu Death Mask Thrusts it at Obie

But the mask’s face has changed The cackle’s been replaced
by a menacing scowl Definitely some bad ju-ju going down

cleaned themselves up Wheels paces ranting

WHEELS
I swear boys if that Freakle-

They’re gonna be fittin’ him for a
wooden kimono

Wheels is interrupted by a set of headlights that pull into
the cemetery It’s a spankin’ pink ‘59 Dodge La Femme

SEXY FEMALE VOICE (0S)
Excuse me but can any of you big
strong men help a little lost
kitten find her way back to town

Faye Morgan slinks out She’s wearing a black “Little Red
Riding Hood” cowl and cape pushed open to reveal cleavage
Wheels snaps Shovel hands him a comb He fixes his pompadour

WHEELS
Tell me your tale Nightingale

Wheels motions toward his bomb

WHEELS
Or if you’re not one for long
speeches hop in my bruiser
(checks out her cleavage)
Me and you can discover America

For a split second Faye’s bubbly persona disappears

FAYE MORGAN
You ain’t gonna find it down there
Columbus

WHEELS
Sorry baby but you got curves
that make 3-D look flat

Faye laughs far from ditzy Is this guy for real

She goes back to being an airhead Pulling out her make-up
compact she checks her face Wheels moves behind her Before
he can glimpse her mirror she SNAPS it closed

Nobody notices THE LIMO has silently entered the graveyard

WHEELS
What’s a fox like you doin’ here

FAYE MORGAN
I’m lost What about you

WHEELS
Wheels and the boys were just
discussin’ a little science
experiment We wanna see how far
we can roll us a couple’a squares

FAYE MORGAN
Ooh Sounds hard I like that

JOLT They’re BLASTED by the limo’s blinding headlights

WHEELS
Clyde whatever joke you’re pullin’
ain’t gonna be funny in a minute

VROOM Suddenly Wheels’s bomb starts all by itself
VROOM So does Faye’s La Femme

The bomb guns it driving straight at them Wheels tackles
Faye out of its path The La Femme follows heading right for
them Wheels pulls Faye out of the path of the second car

Shovel and Lockjaw run off into the graveyard
Fog engulfs Wheels Something whips by him with a GRRROWL
Faye is gone A beat The thing whips back the other way

GRRROWL Wheels hears the thing behind him and abandons ship
Running for his life he hops the old iron cemetery gate

EXT SPOOK HILL ROAD -- THAT MOMENT

Wheels hits the ground running Sprinting down the road a
bit he turns back toward the graveyard It’s gone Not
visible through the thick wall of fog back at the iron gate
The fog rolls down the road toward Wheels It’s time for
BRAVADO (noun) 1 a false showing of bravery in some
circumstances driven by a deep-seeded feeling of intense fear
2 The way that Wheels has just whipped out his switchblade

Three BLOOD-CURDLING SCREAMS rip from the fog Shovel
Lockjaw Then Faye It’s too much for Wheels He runs

And spots his Bomb on the side of the road Wheels dives into
it and fires up the engine He peels out driving into the
black night panting checking his rearview

The bomb’s engine lets out a horrible grumble The car dies

WHEELS
No no stupid piece’a junk

Wheels hops out nervously checking his surroundings He’s
completely alone in the dark

Knocking sounds come from under the hood Wheels pops it open

And THE WOLF grabs him with a loud ROAR Hiding under the
hood it pulls him inside where the engine should be It
happens in a split-second flat

And even though all we see are flashes of glowing eyes sharp
teeth and mammoth furry arms the sound of the GRRROWL alone
should send the audience through the ceiling of the theater

The switchblade drops in the dirt Bent completely in half
It lands right next to an old Tarot card The Sword

Deserted streets It’s a ghost town Except for
HARRY’S CAR-- He’s driving Obie home Obie’s pressing him

HARRY
It’s all just Halloween malarkey
You can lay even money on that

Obie suddenly remembers something He digs in his pocket

OBIE
Speaking of money this is yours
I accidently took it from your lab
It’s s’posed to bring you luck

He gives Harry the old SILVER DOLLAR Harry stares at it hard
for a long beat then he tosses the coin back to Obie

HARRY
Keep it kid You need all the
luck you can get

Obie takes the coin He looks at Harry as a boy would look at
his father Harry gets the message and it makes him uneasy

EXT OBIE’S STREET -- NIGHT

Light beams pass over the car There’s a flurry of activity
Dozens of people with flashlights search the block This
doesn’t look good A MOB descends on Harry’s car led by

OBIE’S MOM
OUT OF THAT CAR NOW LITTLE BOY

She yanks Obie out Harry follows A gasp comes from the mob
The whole town is there They’re keeping their distance
Except Tina Tyler She gets right in Harry’s face

OBIE’S MOM
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING WITH MY
SON ARE YOU SOME KIND OF WEIRDO

Harry stands defensive as the mob huddles around him like the
Frankenstein villagers Obie jumps between Harry and his mom

OBIE
Mom no You have to listen to me

OBIE’S DAD
GET IN THE HOUSE OBIE

AT THE OPPOSITE END OF THE STREET --

The black limo sits in the dark watching the confrontation

BACK OUTSIDE OBIE’S HOUSE --

OBIE
No Not until you two listen to
me There was a monster in our
house tonight A real monster

Harry rubs his face now is not the time kid

OBIE
The sheriff made it come out of the
TV with Morlock’s Monster Pop

Laughs and murmurs of disbelief from the crowd

OBIE’S DAD
So that explains why you smashed it
up on the lawn right Do you have
any idea how much money that cost
How much money we don’t have now

OBIE’S MOM
Enough lies Obie
(to Harry)

Youre feeding him this nonsense

OBIE
Harry saved me I followed Mister
Morlock’s limo on my own I didn’t
want him to ruin the Spook-Tacular

OBIE’S MOM
Youve done that yourself Obie

Obie’s mom takes out the big ticket that Morlock gave him
And RIPS IT into tiny pieces Obie nearly bursts into tears
He looks back to see everyone watching Marilyn from
school Scooter But most important Harry is watching

Fueled by embarrassment sadness and anger Obie lashes out
OBIE

I HATE YOU BOTH I WISH I NEVER
HAD PARENTS

Harry shakes his head silently to himself
Obie grabs his bike and hops on pedaling off into the night
All eyes go back to Harry who calmly bottles his anger

HARRY
(to Obie’s parents)
You two should be proud That’s
some really great parenting lady

Harry fires up his car The mob pounds on his windows A
familiar face presses up against the driver’s side

BOBBY LEE WONG
Fix our darn machine then git
outta this town you no good--

Stay away from my son You hear me

Obie’s bike skids out He looks down at the newly-finished
Drive-In then checks his watch 1111 PM OCT 30 1959

INT DRIVE-IN -- MOMENTS LATER

Obie rides through the main gate None of the sunglass-
wearing workcrew notice as he rides up to

The pentagonal formation of big screens He goes behind them

BEHIND THE SCREENS-- A secluded center area Reinforced
girders hold the screens like a giant STEEL BIRDCAGE

IN THE DRIVE-IN LOT -- Obie emerges but stops Wheels’s bomb
the Sheriff’s cruiser and the limo are headed his way The
Greasers Cops and Biltmoore exit the cars And then the
only one WITHOUT sunglasses emerges Morlock

Sheriff hands Morlock some BUILDING PERMITS Then Biltmoore
blueprints in hand leads the group towards Obie Timing it
Obie sneaks to the limo just as they go behind the screens

OBIE
What are you guys up to

Creeping close again Obie peeks in on them Morlock’s
checking the blueprints against the steel girders

Obie strains to see-- CRACK The wood he leans on busts
Everyone looks in his direction Obie scans for a place to
hide but There’s only one Morlock orders Sheriff and Deputy
to check the noise they do nobody there

The Sheriff eyes the black limo growing suspicious He peers
in the deep black windows All he sees is his own reflection

INSIDE THE LIMOUSINE --

Obie’s in the backseat The Sheriff’s looking straight at him
but can’t see through the window because the tint’s too dark

The Sheriff peers removing his glasses for a better look

JOLT The eyes in his sockets are as black as midnight
Petrified Obie will have nightmares for the rest of his life

And then Deputy appears at the window behind Obie Together
the evil lawmen try the doors They’re locked Whew Obie
watches them check the trunk

IN THE DRIVE-IN LOT-- The lawmen dismiss it and head back
behind the screens Obie gets out And that’s when everyone
emerges from the screens With no choice Obie throws his
bike in the limo trunk and hops in He pulls the lid closed
IN THE TRUNK-- It’s pitch black Obie holds up the lid to see
OUTSIDE-- Morlock spies the broken wood and BICYCLE TRACKS
IN THE TRUNK-- Obie hears him enter the limo Peeks to see

OUTSIDE-- The work CREW surrounds the limo Obie’s fear grows
with each new set of sunglasses Morlock leans out the window

MORLOCK
It’s gonna be one Hell of a show

IN THE TRUNK-- The limo drives off Obie opens the lid but
the car hits a bump- CLICK The trunk latches He’s locked in

Aggie and BELLA the Old Gypsy show Harry their ANCIENT BOOK

AGGIE
Evil has come to your town

The book is full of 15th Century artwork corresponding to

BELLA (OS)
Five hundred years ago in our
small Romanian village there lived
a cruel sorceror named Zaleska

In the book a picture of a hideously UGLY HAG Thunder bangs

BELLA
Zaleska put a trance on the village
with potion and sacrificed its most
innocent to the Prince of Darkness

New page ghost peasants with black eyes gathered in a circle

BELLA
The villagers became living ghosts
Zaleska became a powerful witch

New page A HULKING FIGURE encased in a CAGE OF FIRE

BELLA
Until a brave knight blocked the
portal to the Underworld

Bella flips the last page The Ugly Hag screaming in agony

BELLA
Zaleska was reborn a hideous beast
But The Evil was not destroyed

HARRY
Listen Take your nuthouse papers
and hit the high road to China

He turns to leave- JOLT Bumps into Bella now behind him

BELLA
Stubborn ox This is a warning of
what will befall your town

to do with me or that clod Morlock

MORLOCK (OS)
Everything’s moving to plan but
there’s a small fly in the
ointment a nosy 10 year-old brat

OUTSIDE-- Morlock gives them the order

MORLOCK
Find him and bring him to me

IN THE TRUNK-- OK Obie time to leave But it’s too dark
Obie fishes out the GREEN 3-D GLASSES that Harry made for him
Voila ‘50s night-vision

Obie finds a TIRE IRON and wedges the lid He peeks out
OUTSIDE-- Morlock and company escort Faye Morgan into the crypt

OUTSIDE-- Morlock turns toward the limo’s trunk with a smile

MORLOCK
Seems the brat has brought himself

MORLOCK (OS)

You shouldn’t play in the cemetery
at night The dead don’t like it
when their sleep is disturbed

OUTSIDE -- Morlock tests the strength of the trunk lid then
looks up to the fog-shrouded full moon

IN THE TRUNK-- It starts to SHAKE violently Morlock’s voice
changes to a monster-like growl chilling Obie to the bone

POP-- The trunk latch mysteriously UNLOCKS Obie psyches
himself and shoves the trunk lid open He lifts his head out

OUTSIDE-- Obie scans the cemetery through his GREEN SPECS
Tombstones mausoleum dead trees seems he’s alone

Too bad for Obie that the opened-trunk blocks the view over
his shoulders Then he notices something else in the trunk
A TAROT CARD the Masked Death

A lone DROP hits Obie’s cheek trickling from

THE NINE FOOT-TALL WEREWOLF with razor claws and dripping
fangs that’s standing on the roof silently lurking over him

TERROR (noun) 1 an intense fear of physical injury or death
2 the feeling that makes Obie move faster than he ever has in
his life when THE WOLF SWIPES at him with a GRRROWL

Obie drops back into the trunk yanking it closed

IN THE TRUNK-- BAM The Wolf tries to break through Obie
picks up the tire iron thinking quick

OUTSIDE-- SKRUNCH The Wolf savagely pounds a hole in the
trunk It reaches in and grabs Nothing Obie’s gone

CLUNK The trunk-lid pops open SLAMMING The Wolf in his
chinny-chin-chin It goes down Hard

INSIDE THE LIMOSINE --

Obie lets go of the trunk release lever He’s used the tire
iron to rip through the backseat and has climbed up front

OUTSIDE THE LIMOSINE --

Obie opens the door scrambles to the trunk for his bike
Seems the Wolf is gone Obie lowers the trunk

The Wolf’s not on the roof either
Obie spots a faint reflection in the back window

He DUCKS as a MAMMOTH CLAW WHIZZES over his head Obie dives
back in the trunk but The Wolf’s not falling for that trick
again Instead it goes to the driver’s door and rips it off

WOLF POV-- CLANK- the TIRE IRON sails out of the limo
SMASHING The Wolf’s face in

The trunk BURSTS open Obie leaps out with his bike He hits
the ground pedaling for his life Through his GREEN SPECS
Obie spots an opening in the fog bank and soars into it
DEEPER IN THE GRAVEYARD --

Obie frantically searches for an exit He skids out ina
clearing to catch his breath Sees SOMETHING on the ground

His shadow It disappears as a cloud passes over the moon
A beat The cloud goes by Obie’s shadow returns

JOLT - And there’s ANOTHER HULKING SHADOW right next to it
GRRROWL The Werewolf takes another huge swipe at him

Obie barely ducks The Wolf rips his 3-D specs to shreds

Obie hits a button on his control box- BOOM A newspaper
fires like a missile from the bikes’s mounted cannon

Hitting the wolf square in the WOLFMAN NARDS

Obie rides pedaling for the main gate The Wolf leaps in his
path Obie uses a toppled headstone as a ramp and JUMPS it

But The Wolf rips his back tire off in the air

The bike SLAMS down sending Obie over the handle bars onto
his back Something SHINY lands in the dirt next to him

It’s Harry’s SILVER DOLLAR

The Wolf comes in for the kill Obie throws dirt in his eyes
blinding it He somersaults grabbing the coin as he rolls

Obie comes up with LOADED SLINGSHOT aimed at The Wolf

OBIE
KEEP THE CHANGE

FOOM-- Good shot The SILVER DOLLAR nails The Wolf in the
shoulder It howls in sizzling pain running off into the fog

But there’s no CRASH The mask doesn’t make a sound

Morlock stands at the door Dressed in a slick Jack the

Morlock’s left arm is hidden under the cloak He sets the
mask down and marvels at the bottling machine

But it goes without saying the
right guy for the job

out where you came from but I’m
gonna insist you go back Now

Bella’s in bad shape Mustering her last bit of strength she
channels LIGHTNING into Faye But when the smoke clears she’s
only messed up Faye’s hair Now Faye’s really pissed

FAYE MORGAN
Sorry granny but this is one
Halloween party where there’s no
bats allowed

Faye waves her hand magically SLAMMING Bella into the ceiling
then back down onto the floor Standing over Bella Faye
flips the pages of the old book searching for the right
spell And reads the ancient line

FZZZT A furious TORNADO OF BOLTS envelops Bella lifting her
Sadly her evil energy proves too much for the old gypsy

Harry’s in agony but tries to do something He crawls
across the floor inching his way toward the metal ball
he’s almost there but someone beats him to it

Faye opens the spell book and reads a line in ancient tongue
Thunder booms Her eyes glow red Her voice is unearthly and
echoed The voice from the beginning of the story

Call from hell the snarling hound
Sacred rights not once read

They’re almost upon him One’s just about to grab when a
NOOSE drops around its neck It’s hoisted in the air by

Obie Clutching the rope he leaps off a cross beam the
counter-weight carrying him to the ground He kicks another
monster then grabs a nearby torch using it to wave off the
walking dead

Obie tosses Harry a pocket knife Harry frees himself and
picks up one of the fallen crypt lids

HARRY
Get behind me

Using the lid as a shield Harry plows their way out of the
crypt Obie waves the torch covering the rear

HARRY

OBIE

HARRY
Obie I Listen

This is hard for him to say It takes a moment to come out

HARRY
You were right Obie I’m sorry
I’m sorry I didn’t believe in you

OBIE
There’s no time for that You’re
just lucky I followed Morlock here

HARRY
Morlock’s not the bad guy

A nasty GROWL interrupts their moment TWO FEROCIOUS
GRAVEYARD DOGS stand poised for attack Jackal-like hell
hounds-- make that hungry jackal-like hell hounds

Without a thought Harry picks up Obie and bolts The blood-

A skeletal hand grabs Harry He SNAPS it in two then picks up
a grave marker - an OLD WOODEN CROSS Three red-eyed
SKELETONS move in on him as he wields it like a baseball bat

Obie grips an iron rod in a tug of war with the two dogs
BARK The hell hounds bite Obie’s rod in half

Harry swings his cross to no avail He and Obie flee
KRACK The dogs disappear in a flash of lightning
KRA-KRACK They materialize right in front of Harry and
Obie And the skeletons are closing in behind them

Harry spots a freshly dug grave

HARRY
When I say now hit the deck-- NOW

Obie drops Harry sommersaults landing behind the skeletons
He rams them with his cross tackling-sled style He pushes
the skeletons into the dogs the hungry hounds SNAPPING

HARRY
KNICK-KNACK PADDY-WHACK
GIVE - A - DOG - A - BONE

With all his might he shoves them all into the empty grave

Vicious snarls are heard in the hole Bones bounce up and
down It’s a feast A half-skeleton desperately climbs out
JOLT A dog drags it back down into the grave with a growl

HARRY
Obie you alright Obie

Obie doesn’t answer Silent and wide eyed he’s staring at
things that are appearing all over the graveyard

GHOSTS Dozens of ghosts walk the grounds like mindless
drones We recognize The Mayor Haywood Bobby Lee
Lupita The ghosts of the townspeople

Samhain Harry The ghosts of the
living walk the graveyard

Obie checks his watch 1045 PM OCT 31 1959

If we don’t stop this by midnight

Oh no NO NO NO

Obie runs Harry follows mouth falling open as sees

The ghosts of OBIE’S PARENTS The little boy has come face to
face with the spirits of his mother and father Crying Obie
futilely tries to hold them back

OBIE
(frantic)
I TOLD YOU NOT TO GO PLEASE NO

It’s a hard sight for Harry to see Obie in pain He knows
exactly how the boy feels Obie tries to stop them but

The ghosts walk right through him Harry grabs Obie

We have to move We can get down

Obie’s real PARENTS search the Drive-In for their son They
pass the concession tent Dozens of people gulp Monster Pop

FSSST Overhead a light beam cuts across the Drive-In lot
Everyone turns to one of the big movie screens where
THE GALAXY PICTURES LOGO APPEARS

AROUND THE VARIOUS PROJECTION BOOTHS --

BOOTH 1-- Morlock has just turned on the projector
BOOTH 2-- FSSST- Biltmore fires up another movie
BOOTH 3-- FSSST- The Sheriff follows suit

BOOTH 4-- FSSST- As does The Deputy

BOOTH 5-- FSSST- Wheels turns on the final projector
IN THE DRIVE-IN --

The crowd watches in amazement all the big screens flicker to
life at once Five black and white horror B-movies

BEHIND THE SCREENS-- The dangling Aggie is lit by the eerie
glow No matter how much she struggles she’s helpless

AT THE CONCESSION TENT-- The Monster Pop frenzy’s dying down
Morlock ushers Haywood out He orders Shovel and Lockjaw to
rip the big cauldron off of the bottling machine Together
they carry it to the roof of one of the projection booths
Morlock follows with a sneer All around him patrons gulp
Monster Pop as they stare at his movies All except for

EXT HILLTOP -- NIGHT

Harry and Obie rush to the top of Spook Hill What they see
on the valley floor below is enough to bowl them over

HARRY
That’s one hell of a whammy circle

He’s right From here we see Faye’s plan in all its glory
The circular drive-in Five screens in a PENTAGON FORMATION
Five projector booths with light beams fanning out from pin-
points along the perimeter to create FIVE POINTS OF A STAR

WHEN FULLY OPERATIONAL THE CINCO-RAMA IS A GIANT PENTAGRAM
WITH A STAR MADE OF LIGHT

Visible only from Spook Hill it couldn’t be seen before
because the projectors were turned off Now it makes sense

HARRY
An incantation to bring forth the
Prince of Darkness on Halloween
And enough Monster Pop to create an
army that’ll cancel his Christmas

OBIE
She’s not gonna take over the world

HARRY
Not when she can take over the
under-world instead

Obie hands Harry his “HOW TO KILL MONSTERS” list Harry
stares at it the mad scientist burning in his eyes

HARRY
Get down to the Drive-In See if
you can find Aggie Just don’t do
anything till I get there

OBIE
How are we gonna stop that witch

HARRY
(remembering dad’s advice)
Well find a way Or well build
one

With that Harry’s gone Obie charges down the hill and
just as it was twenty years ago a ten year-old boy races down
the hill at full stride desperate to reach the light

Only this time the fate of mankind is at stake

Harry hangs Joe’s shrunken heads from his tool belt before
slipping one final item inside

KRACK-BOOM With a final clap of thunder everything goes
silent and black Obie and Aggie stand in the dark

The lights slowly fade up around them to reveal
THEY’RE SURROUNDED BY THE WORST CREEPIES AND CRAWLIES OF
CHILDREN’S DARKEST NIGHTMARES

All who drank the Monster Pop have become horrible creatures
of the night terrorizing the INNOCENTS who did not drink

People transform into the monster costumes they’re wearing

New MONSTERS leap out from the screens as each bottle crashes
against them 3-D TERRORS from beyond start to attack

Obie’s favorite creature JACK O’LANTERN smiles an evil
pumpkin grin as his giant grasshopper leg steps out the movie
screen and into real life His glowing face takes it all in

Lightning flashes as Obie and Aggie get behind Faye Obie
gives Aggie the signal They shove Faye right off the roof

Faye goes over the edge but she doesn’t fall Floating in
the air she cackles collecting lightning swirls around her

FAYE MORGAN
Do I look like a push over to you

She BLASTS at Obie with a energy bolt Rolling out of the
way Obie goes off the edge of the roof hanging on by his
fingertips three stories off the ground

With a wave Faye magically lifts Aggie into the air up
up fifty feet holding her in a hovering prison

FAYE MORGAN
There’s no one who can stop me now

KA-BLAMM Just as those words leave her mouth the wall
opposite her EXPLODES The black hearse CAREENS into the
Drive-In lot spinning to a halt its headlights shining back
at the hole it just made

A LONE FIGURE steps through the hole in the wall

With two metal cannons hung at his sides like some kind of
inter-galactic cowboy a brilliant shine comes from his face

FAYE MORGAN
Who in the hell are you

WSH-WSH-WSH A gleaming frisbee hurls at her Faye catches
it It’s the metal sign from the porch and it now reads

HAROLD SPINGLEMEYER WITCH-DOCTOR

Just like a welder does the figure flips up his now mirror-
plated ZULU DEATH MASK to reveal

HARRY
Trick or treat witch It’s time
to take your medicine

Harry cranks up the air pressure fires his cannon - BOOM A
rolled newspaper shoots out like a missile It hits the
projection booth’s support leg The roof pitches forward

flinging the bubbling cauldron at Faye Soaked by the
boiling mess she falls to the ground

As Obie hangs on for dear life the balcony he dangles from
pitches forward He leaps safely to the ground just in time

The spell now broken Aggie drops from her hovering prison
She manages to barely catch hold of a suspended cable with
lights on it clinging for her life above the ground

Scanning for THE SPELL BOOK Aggie sees it on the toppled roof
of the projection booth amid the mess

IN THE LOT-- Harry stands firm monsters and mortals gaping
at him Faye gets up slowly It’s a stand-off until

FAYE MORGAN
KILLLLLLLLL HIMMMMMMMMM

All of the monsters rush Harry TWO DRACULAS land right in
front of him He whips out his mechanical mallet

HARRY
Don’t count on it

WHAM The spring-loaded arm pops out holding a wooden fence
picket The mallet RAMS it home Both Dracs get the point

As they go down the evil aura surrounding the Dracs vanishes
The Dracs transform back into SLUMBERING TOWNSFOLK but
that’s not important because more
Monsters crawl out of the woodwork It’s a creature riot
AMID ALL THE ACTION-- We find Obie’s parents hiding behind a
car with Scooter and Marilyn Peering out from hiding they
watch Obie rapidly SLING-SHOT three fiends

lantern hypnotizing all of them with the glow

Nearby Obie sees them mesmerized They’re catatonic

OBIE

BACK TO HARRY--
He spins around in time to see A MUMMY and A GHOUL closing on
him Whipping a paint roller contraption from his belt Harry

grabs the Mummy’s bandage and gives the roller a spin

HARRY
Not so fast King Tut

The Mummy’s bandage spools onto Harry’s roller The Mummy
collapses to a pile of dusty bones Harry quickly loads the
roller into his paper cannon just as The Ghoul grabs him

HARRY
I’m on a roll

BOOM He fires The bandage wraps around and around winding
the ghoul up tight just like a mummy

Harry hears a scream He spots Aggie hanging on the cable
above him her grip slipping He’s gotta get to her quick
But something’s lurking in the shadows behind him

Flipping the Zulu Death Mask down over his face he peers
through the green night-lenses now in the mask’s eyes

JOLT Night-vision reveals a MAD BEAST bull-charging at him

Harry yanks a vial from his tool belt Covering his eyes he
throws it down smashing it on the floor FOOM There’s a
BRILLIANT FLASH like a stun grenade The Beast goes blind

Harry clocks the beast with his mallet then looks up at Aggie

OBIE takes his cue and elbows Shovel in the nuts then stomps
Lockjaw’s foot He catches the thing Harry just threw
It’s the mechanical mallet

OBIE
STAKE

WHAM The mallet fires a picket punching Wheels’s ticket

WHAM-WHAM Obie quickly greases the other two greasers
spinning to see Jack O’Lantern about to get his parents

Just then Wheels comes to snapping out of his trance He’s
not a vamp anymore but he’s still an asshole

WHEELS

Tyler you’re dead mea--

THUNK A spinning hub-cap SOARS KONKING Wheels in the head
He goes out for the count The hub was thrown by

Never breaking stride he’s still hell-bent on saving Aggie
He better hurry though ‘cause she’s about to fall

Harry tugs a zip-line on his belt loads it in his cannon

BOOM The line FIRES thunking into one of the screens
Harry runs up a car leaps off its roof just as Aggie slips
and falls She’s screaming as

Harry swings through the air catching her in mid-fall She
clings to him as they touch down safely Aggie’s in awe By
the look on Harry’s mug he can’t believe what he did either

Sharing a moment he’s about to say something

WHACK A vicious FURRY BACKHAND sends Harry CRASHING to the
floor He drops his cannon WOLF FEET step in front of him
THE HULKING MONSTER morphs halfway between man and monster

MORLOCK
That was some show But I’m afraid
it’s time for the curtain to fall

On the ground Harry struggles to grab the other newspaper
cannon still slung to his left side The MORLOCK WOLF-BEAST
picks Harry up hurling him ten yards Harry crashes hard

The Morlock Wolf-Beast swats Aggie away leaps to Harry
MORLOCK
Youre just like your no good
inventions Spinglemeyer

The Morlock Wolf-Beast FLINGS Harry the other way SMASHING
him into a car The newspaper cannon lands in front of him

MORLOCK
Your purpose has been served

Dazed Harry struggles to crawl to his feet The Morlock Wolf-
Beast picks up the paper cannon laughing at it

MORLOCK
Beat me With this thing Ha ha
ha Paper covers rock But it

doesn’t cover wolf

Morlock arrogantly tosses the cannon to Harry Stunned Harry
catches it

HARRY
Hot of the press Melvin It’s not
loaded with paper so say goodbye
to Hollywood

BOOM A barrage of FLYING SILVERWARE soars through the air
like buckshot The Morlock-Beast’s eyes widen That’s a wrap

BACK TO OBIE--

Trying to stop Jack O’Lantern Obie loads his rubber mallet
into his slingshot and pulls the strap back

FOOSH The mallet soars BONKING Jack O’Lantern in his huge
pumpkin head He drops his lamp It SMASHES to the floor

Obie’s parents Scooter and Marilyn snap out of the trance

Jack O’Lantern’s fightin’ mad Obie runs to Scooter yanks
off his leather jacket

OBIE
I need to borrow this

Obie uses the jacket to pick up the GLOWING COAL from Jack’s
lamp Shows it to the monster Jack hides his face in fear

When Obie steps forward Jack backs up Obie takes more
steps using the coal to maneuver the big monster into

GIANT SQUID TENTACLES protruding from a nearby screen The
tentacles grab Jack O’Lantern bashing him until his pumpkin
head breaks The coal burns out Obie turns to the group

OBIE
Are you okay

His parents and Marilyn nod They’re all amazed Except
SCOOTER
We’re all right no thanks to you

Fed up Marilyn hauls off and socks Scooter in the kisser

MARILYN

Where’s Faye

AGGIE
Forget Faye where’s the book

It’s right where she last saw it On the toppled projection
booth An evil cackle fills the air Faye Morgan crawls atop
the wreckage and picks up the book

FAYE MORGAN
NOW MY SPELL WILL BE COMPLETE
WITH POINTED TAIL AND CLOVEN FEET

Faye stares right through Harry’s soul a ball of evil energy
collecting in her free hand Harry watches it build Faye
points at Harry with her free hand It’s got his name on it

HARRY
Bring it

FZZZT Faye unleashes the blast at him With a quick nod of
the head Harry flips the mirror-plated Zulu Death mask down
in front of his face

The blast RICOCHETS right back at Faye Her eyes widen as it
SLAMS home throwing her into a pile of wreckage

Harry flips up his mask Haywood pokes up from behind a car

HAYWOOD THE SODA JERK
Damn That’s some bad hat Harry

Eerie calm settles in but just for a moment Faye’s laugh
echoes out ushering in a wave of havoc One by one cars
flip over People run in fear for their lives

Clutching the spell book Faye soars out of the wreckage up
onto the Drive-In’s perimeter wall

Obie sees her next to the kerosene torches Now’s his chance

BAM-BAM-BAM Obie topples the torches on the wall with three
rapid sling-shot bursts Kerosene spills creating a RING OF
FIRE circling the top of the wall

The fire engulfs Faye Screaming she falls and drops the
spell book Aggie catches it and flips it open And the
ground RUMBLES violently Faye’s evil cackle echoes louder

FAYE MORGAN (0S)
ILL WEAR YOUR SOULS LIKE COSTUME
JEWELRY AS I WATCH THE STARS BURN
OUT THE END OF MAN HAS ARRIVED

The ground breaks apart It’s just like the cheesey movie
Obie was watching in class only now it’s real

FAYE MORGAN
TONIGHT I REALIZE MY LIFE LONG
DREAM
TO UNLOCK HELL THIS HALLOWEEN

BEHIND THE SCREENS-- A brilliant GLOW shoots into the sky
The gate has been opened The huge earthquake intensifies

HARRY
Whatever you’re gonna do do it
fast
Aggie frantically flips through the spell book
AGGIE
I can’t find the spell You have
to block the portal

HARRY
Block it With what

AGGIE and OBIE
ANYTHING

Harry checks for something anything He grabs the first
thing he sees next to him in the back of Bobby Lee’s truck

The BUNNY chomps on a carrot Harry yanks it from the bunny’s
mouth and hurls the carrot as hard as he can

The carrot disappears over and into the middle of the screens
The bunny sprints for it like a dog playing fetch

INT BOWELS OF THE EARTH -- THAT MOMENT
An unseen EVIL FORCE tunnels its way up through a passage of

fiery rock It comes through the opening into the area
between the movie screens just as the bunny hops inside

The evil force goes straight into the innocent creature
IN THE DRIVE-IN --
BAM-BAM Two SONIC BOOMS echo then all falls deathly quiet

HARRY
Is it over Did we stop it

CREEEAK One of the screens TOPPLES over to the right Then
one to the left The screen in front of them falls forward

OBIE
HOLY

HARRY
HOSSENFEFFER

Standing before them the cute BUNNY has been changed into
A BUNNY-SAURUS-REX Twenty feet tall Blood-red eyes
Dripping razor teeth Claws like sabers Legs ripped with
muscle Anda giant cute fuzzy cotton tail

The rabbit from depths of Hell roars with primal fury

It stomps toward the plaster carrot on Bobby Lee’s truck
Bobby spits out his wheat chaff and aims his varmint gun

BOBBY LEE WONG
You might take my life but you’1l
never take my truck you som—bee--

BLAM He pops a shot pissing off the bunny-saurus It rams
the truck flipping it The big carrot breaks off A beat
later the mutant rabbit promptly gobbles up Bobby Lee

The rampaging bunny-saurus charges toward Harry and company
Just as Aggie finds the right spell in the book

AGGIE
HERE IT IS

HARRY
Read Now

The bunny-saur barrels straight for them Aggie’s petrified

AGGIE
But but but

HARRY
READ IT

The bunny-saur is right on top of them Thinking fast Harry
whips a REMOTE off his belt and pushes a red button

HARRY
(sotto)
This one’s for you Dad

BOOM The back door of Joe’s hearse blows open A gurney
slides out launching a wooden coffin between Harry and the
bunny-saurus-rex

SMASH A huge METAL FIST EXPLODES from inside the coffin

The RESCUE ROBOT now wearing Obie’s Frankenstein mask rises
from the coffin It engages the bunny-saur in combat the two
battling it out like a couple of B-movie titans

Inside the robot’s clockwork chest the silver dollar surges
with power A heart with a hole in it beats twice as strong

The robot trades blows with the bunny-saur holding it off as
Aggie reads from the book in an ancient tongue Above the
sky opens Winds whip The spell is working Until

FAYE MORGAN (0S)
NNNNOOOOOOOOOO0CO0

Horribly burned Faye emerges Her voice unearthly No
longer the beautiful bombshell Faye’s old and weathered
True form revealed Faye is a HIDEOUS SHE-BITCH

FAYE MORGAN
YOU WILL ALL DIE

She blasts BOLTS at Aggie Harry whips off his mask using it
as a shield He deflects the blasts as Aggie reads The wind
swirls kick up as

The rescue robot picks up the big plaster carrot like a
baseball bat and swats the bunny The carrot SNAPS in two

Faye blasts the mask away from Harry Now he’s defenseless

FAYE MORGAN
I MAY NOT HAVE HELL BUT ILL STILL
HAVE YOUR HEAD

She prepares to fire her killer blast

DEEP CREEPY VOICE (0S)
WATANGO

FAYE MORGAN
What

A MECH-POTATOHEAD scurries toward Faye Then another And
another More scurry out of the woodwork

Aloha Joe stands atop the back wall of the Drive-In raising
his glowing voodoo skull guiding an ARMY OF POTATOHEADS that
swarms Faye like rats She picks off a few with pot-shots

Harry has his chance Whipping the SHRUNKEN HEADS off his
belt he spins them overhead like a bolo Then throws them

The shrunken heads SCREAM TO LIFE as they fly through the air

SHRUNKEN HEADS
AAARRRGGGHHHHHHHHHHH

The screaming heads wrap around Faye biting into her
shoulders Behind her THE BATTLE OF THE BEHEMOTHS rages as
the Rescue Robot and the bunny-saurus beat each other
senseless The bunny-saur pummels the Robot SLAMMING it
down The SILVER DOLLER HEART pops out of its chest

The Rescue Robot dies The battered bunny-saur shakes off its
damage staggering around for its next victim

Harry seizes the opportunity Picking up the top half of the
broken plaster carrot Harry SHOVES it over Faye’s head

The B-rex spots the half-carrot with human legs and

CHOMP The bunny-saur makes a meal out of Faye Morgan But
the impromptu plan backfires on Harry Big time

In her final act of evil Faye’s dying spell melds her forces
with the B-rex Contorting it gets larger uglier
meaner The bunny-saur grows epic quickly becoming

LEPORIDAE GARGANTUA For Centerville Halloween has just
become the Night of the Giant Killer Lepus

It STOMPS over toward the concession stand where all of the
unaffected townspeople huddle in fear Obie’s parents the
Mayor Haywood Marilyn everyone even Obie

Theyre all helpless in the sight of the Killer Gargantua

Gear depleted Harry has one thing at his disposal And as The
Gargantua stalks the townfolk Harry realizes what he must do

He stares hard at the fallen Rescue Robot FOCUSING his
thoughts Reaching for his tool belt Harry turns to Aggie

HARRY
Whatever happens finish the spell

AGGIE
No Harry don’t--

But it’s too late With no other choice Harry shows the town
of Centerville the ultimate meaning of the word

COURAGE (noun) 1 The quality mind or spirit that enables a
person to face difficulty danger or pain without fear 2
The selfless act that Harold Spinglemeyer performs when

He raises the glowing bottle of BLUE MONSTER POP to his lips
and drinks it down without so much as a second thought

AT THE CONCESSION STAND --

Obie and his parents hold each other The townsfolk huddle
around The shadow of the Gargantua falls over them The
killer rabbit lunges for a bite which SNAPS short because

A hulking set of CYBORG-LIKE ARMS have it by the tail

Holding the Gargantua at bay is THE AMAZING COLOSSAL HARRY
He’s a thirteen-foot HULK of muscle accentuated by robotic
joints ready to finish the job his dad’s creation started

As she watches the Colossal Harry protect the others Aggie
looks to the heavens and recites the spell’s final line

AGGIE
Winds of hope end the Season of
Fall
Banish the evil once and for all

A VORTEX opens from the Hell gate between the screens An
upside-down tornado back into Hell sucking in everything
around it The screen Cars The dirt from the ground

In the eye of the storm the Amazing Colossal Harry lifts
Gargantua above his head carries it through the tornado and
tosses its evil bunny-ass straight back into Hell

Exhausted he collapses at the edge of the rift and
SHAPESHIFTS back into normal Harry He grabs onto a Drive-In
speaker post struggling to keep himself out of the vortex

Everyone else clings to speaker posts for dear life against
the unrelenting vacuum The spell book is ripped from Aggie

AGGIE
NO

Letting go of her speaker post she tries to retrieve the
book getting sucked right past Harry He grabs her hand
struggling even harder to hold onto his post

Aggie gets the book back but she’s slipping from Harry’s
grip Harry has nothing left in him to hang onto her

HARRY
LET IT GO

The tornado rages around them

AGGIE
NO I CANT MY GRANDMOTHER
HARRY
YOU HAVE TO LET IT GO SHE’D
WANT YOU TO START OVER
(sincere)
Aggie please we can do it

together

Aggie closes her eyes She releases the book grabbing
Harry’s hand with hers The book soars into the vortex

The vortex closes All falls silent It’s over The weather
magically clears Faye’s spell has been broken

Around the Drive-In fallen creatures awaken as normal
townsfolk once again The transformation has been reversed

Harry opens his eyes Aggie holds him Obie’s there And so
is Aloha Joe Harry gives him a dry smirk

HARRY
Glad you finally decided to show

ALOHA JOE
What can I say I’m a clutch man
EXT DRIVE-IN -- DAWN

Daybreak People scattered all around Clean-up has begun
In a lonely section Aggie stares down at a puddle sobbing
quietly A war-torn Harry comes over She dries a tear

HARRY
(soft)
We make a pretty good team I’m
sure Bella would’ve been proud

AGGIE
She is Thank you Harry

Aggie kisses him Harry nearly falls off his feet stumbling
back into the puddle where Bella’s smiling image dissipates
as his foot crashes into the water She’s gone

IN ANOTHER SECTION-- Obie shares a moment with his parents

OBIE
I’m sorry I didn’t mean what I
said before

OBIE’S MOM
We know Obie We’re sorry too

Obie’s parents see Harry with Aggie

OBIE’S MOM
Mr Spinglemeyer Harry Thank
you for listening to our son

MAYOR FAREWEATHER
(mean
Harold Spinglemeyer

Harry and The Mayor square off staring at each other in
awkward silence It’s a tense moment until The Mayor smiles

MAYOR FAREWEATHER
This town has been very wrong about
you for a long time Please accept
my our most sincere apology

The Mayor extends his hand Harry stares at it with regret
Is there really too much past hurt for him to totally let go

HARRY
I’m sorry Mayor but
(looks at Obie then)
--Il was wrong about all of you I
hope your town our town can
forgive me

Harry shakes the Mayor’s hand
MAYOR FAREWEATHER
No need for an apology We owe you
our eternal gratitude You sir
are a great inventor
(suddenly realizes)
We also owe a debt of thanks to
your young sidekick as well

HARRY
(firm)
You got that wrong Mayor He’s
not my sidekick

Obie looks down glumly

HARRY
He’s the real hero And he’s my
best friend Here Obie I think
you dropped something

Obie looks up in appreciation as Harry hands him the SILVER
DOLLAR with the hole in it Obie grasps it tightly then
springs into Harry’s arms Nearby

WHEELS
AHH GET A ROOM

Wheels knuckle-dusted and bruised pipes up from the wreck
The Sheriff leads him away

SHERIFF DUNN
I think a month stay at the Graybar
hotel can cure that mouth right up

WHEELS
Aint a cell in the world that can
hold Wheels flatfoot

The strong Deputy Reddy grabs him Hard Wheels folds faster
than Superman on laundry day With a gulp

WHEELS
Except yours sir Sorry

We fly over the Drive-In Lupita sobs over Bobby Lee’s truck
but quickly finds comfort in the arms of Prof Wells

LUPITA
Jou are a very smart man

Her pet bunny hops out from under Bobby Lee’s hat chewing a
chaff of wheat It angrily hops after them

Elsewhere a car trunk opens Scooter hops out holding a hub-
cap on top of his head for protection
SCOOTER
LEAVE ME ALONE I GOT NO BRAINS
YA HEAR I GOT NO BRAINS

We pull up up and away as he runs through the lot From
above a long line of cars leaves the wrecked drive-in

FADE OUT
EXT INT DRIVE-IN DEMOLITION SITE -- THAT MOMENT
Snow falls over a massive tear-down effort led by
Biltmoore Demolition Art Biltmoore now normal like everyone

else sips coffee at his trailer overseeing the clean-up

STATE RELIEF CREWS fill dump trucks Obie’s parents deliver a
fresh shipment of supplies Looks like business is booming

In a far corner crews cram any salvageable goods they find
into SALVATION ARMY TRUCKS that are packed to the gills

Just then A WORKER spots something amid the garbage An old
cardboard box He looks inside and finds nothing unusual

Just a few sealed soda bottles

They’re in pretty good shape The worker puts the box on a
truck closes the cargo door and waves the truck off The
Salvation Army truck rolls onto the snowy highway destination
unknown stocked full of items for the poor

And one unassuming case of Monster Pop

The truck heads toward the hills kicking up lots of dust
Something blows by in the truck’s wake

One lonely tarot card It lands on the road face up
The Spilled Cup

As we settle in on it all we can do is pray that Aloha Joe
was wrong about what the cards foretell For all our sakes

FADE TO BLACK
EXT CENTERVILLE TOWN SQUARE -- COLD DAY
Holiday lights Decorations Snow blankets all A white
Christmas And a new statue in the center of the square
The RESCUE ROBOT with Frankenstein’s face has a Santa hat on
EXT INT HARRY’S HOUSE -- THAT MOMENT

The wall’s been torn down The garden is visible from the
road Inside a fire roars The house is warm Lived in

Aggie sets a turkey on the table Obie whips a mech-saw off
his tool belt to carve it His parents are there Joe too

Harry raises a glass to toast his new family and Marconi
the rat The pet is on the table wearing a tiny neck brace

Nearby the television blares Everyone watches smiling
ON THE TELEVISION --
Snow blankets the majestic lawns of THE WHITE HOUSE

WALTER CRONKITE (VO)
This truly is a monumental day in
the history of our two nations

INT WHITE HOUSE -- THAT MOMENT

A mansion-sized kitchen
A MAID pulls two chilled SODA BOTTLES from the refrigerator
She doesn’t notice the fizzling glow as she cracks them open

Carrying a tray with the soda we track the Maid down a
majestic Hall to a door TWO MEN IN BLACK wave her through

WALTER CRONKITE (VO)
In this time of cold war the warm
glow of friendship can be felt all
around the world as bitter enemies
come together

EXT BIG CITY STREET -- COLD DAY

A throng of CHRISTMAS SHOPPERS all bundled-up in warm
clothing huddle outside of MACY’S in the snow They’re glued
to the rows of TVs in the store window display

ON TV -- each side of the screen is bordered by a flag One
belongs to the USA the other is SOVIET

WALTER CRONKITE (VO)
Perhaps it’s a sign of hope
Perhaps it’s the seed of civility
Perhaps it’s nothing more than a
soft drink and a smile

The shoppers at the window all watch the news together as

Two bottles of Monster Pop CLANK together in a toast to world
peace As we PULL BACK we see they’re held by THE PRESIDENT
OF THE UNITED STATES and THE PREMIER OF THE SOVIET UNION

WALTER CRONKITE (VO)
Whatever it may be this
commentator thinks it is only the
beginning

THE END
