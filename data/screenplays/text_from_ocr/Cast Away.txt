FADE IN
EXT MARFA TEXAS - 1993 - WIDE - DAY
The Texas plains horizon to horizon nothing but the browns
and ochres of earth and the blue and violet of the sky The
sheer scope of it sinks in the blank slate of nature the
absence of man On the screen superimpose

MARFA TEXAS 1993
CREDITS BEGIN

A plume of dust comes into frame The dust is from a TRUCK
orange and white and violet with FedEx blazoned across the
side

The truck turns into a collection of ramshackle World War II
era Quonset huts and outbuildings Around the outbuildings
are large sculptures of wood and metal

EXT QUONSET HUT - DAY

The door is opened by a WOMAN in her late twenties Hair
pulled back casual an artist She hands the DRIVER a FedEx
BOX which is decorated with a drawing of two ANGEL WINGS

The Driver has a hand-held computer a portable printer
dangles from his belt

The Driver scans the package with his hand-held computer
prints out a label and sticks it on the Box ready to go

But something on the box catches her eye She wants it back
He glances at his watch She draws RINGS around the Wings
uniting them She gives the box to the Driver then hands
him a cup of coffee Theyve done this before

He takes a sip of the coffee then runs for the truck He
jumps in and heads back onto the plains

EXT FEDEX OFFICE - MIDLANDODESSA - NIGHT - HOURS LATER

The Driver jams the distinctive Angel Wing Box on top of a
dolly and loads it into a CONTAINER with clear plastic sides

of rollers onto a larger truck The doors of the truck
close The latch slams down

A forklift hoists the container to the cargo doors of a 737

EXT SUPERHUB - NIGHT - MINUTES LATER

One of a seemingly endless line of FedEx planes our 737
taxis to a gate at the FedEx SUPERHUB The Hub is a vast
living organism -- loud complex overwhelming as much a
symbol of modern life as was the factory in Modern Times
Five thousand people work in a frenzy of interconnected
activity inside three vast hangers brightly lit Hundreds of
forklifts and cargo-pullers dart about their headlights

crisscrossing like a laser show

Loaders quickly roll the container onto a FORKLIFT
INT MEMPHIS SUPERHUB - NIGHT

The forklift speeds inside one of the hangers to a LOADING
BELT where our Box is spilled into a Mississippi River of
packages HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS of them all shapes and
sizes from shoe boxes to engine blocks Large mechanical
arms divert the immense flow of Workers at dozens of
stations The packages surge and move

The Workers place the packages label-side-up on new belts
where theyre scanned by laser readers Picking up speed our
Box is shunted across the acres of interlocking belts

The Box ends up in a much larger CONTAINER labeled CDG

EXT MEMPHIS SUPERHUB - NIGHT

A forklift lifts the Container to a door on a giant MD-11

INT FEDEX OFFICES - DAY

The staff has assembled near the loading dock Yuri the
station manager stands in front occasionally catching the
eye of the attractive woman Chuck displays the FedEx box

CHUCK
It took this test package thirty-two
hours to get from Seattle to St
Petersburg a distance of nine thousand
miles And then it took forty-one hours
to get from our warehouse in St
Petersburg to here a distance of

what --
ALEKSEI
Six kilometers Four miles
CHUCK
So how are we going to get this place
shaped up

Theres a muttered chorus of answers
CHUCK
Theres only one way We have to work
together Every one of us depends on
everyone else If one package is late
we are all late If one truck misses the
deadline we all miss the deadline
Lets start by taking a look around

Chuck leads his team through the sorting area Yuri squeezes
right next to him ostentatiously carrying a clipboard
Chuck stops

CHUCK
Here this table is too far from the
wall Packages can slip downlike
(pulls out a package from
behind a table)
this

He hefts the package as if trying to guess whats inside

CHUCK
What could be in here Lets say one of
you sent it Could be the closing papers
on your dacha could be a toy for your
grandsons birthday could be a kidney to
keep your mother alive I dont think
you want your mothers kidney to end up
behind a table

The Sorter shoves the table against the wall Yuri says
something to the Translator

TRANSLATOR

He says they have been very busy It is
hard to get good employees He is sure
you understand

Wrong answer Chuck glances sharply at Yuri Aleksei
appears with a cellular phone

ALEKSEI
Phone call Malaysia

Chuck takes the phone opening his BAG as he does so

CHUCK
Kamal Right Im getting them

He pulls out a set of blueprints and tacks them to a bulletin
board as he talks
CHUCK
Im looking at the blueprints of KL
right now The belts are too small for

the sorters Yeah sometimes you never
see whats right in front of your face
Look its --

Chuck keeps an eye on what is going on in the warehouse
Then he notices something over by one of the trucks

CHUCK

(to a loader)
Hold it Hazardous material needs its
own container

(back on the phone)
-- three in the afternoon there right
That gives you five hours until the sweep
comes through Do the sort by hand
tonight then put in a new feeder belt
say a twenty-four incher Yes overtime
is authorized

He hangs up the phone He turns to the crew

CHUCK
Im going out on every route Im going
to work every job here until I know
enough to help you Thats it

The crew disperses back to work Chuck and Aleksei walk
toward the office Theyve done this before Chuck lets a
corner of his command persona slip

ALEKSEI

CHUCK
Worse than Warsaw

ALEKSEI
Nobody remembers that

CHUCK
The failures they remember Its the
successes they forget

EXT ST PETERSBURG - DAY - MOMENTS LATER

A FedEx truck pulls out of the FedEx office Chuck is
inside He notices the graffiti on the walls

Chuck rides next to LEV the driver a serious sort The
Translator squats on some boxes between them trying to keep
his balance

CHUCK
You sorted your packages before you left
None of the other drivers did

The Translator and Lev exchange a few words

TRANSLATOR
He says he wants to be organized Do
packages in order

Chuck looks at Lev with respect Right answer

CHUCK
So how come the other drivers havent
left yet

The Translator asks Lev who looks at him as if he is crazy
then snorts an answer The Translator blushes

TRANSLATOR
He says -- he is a very rude fellow --

CHUCK
Tell me exactly what he said

TRANSLATOR
He says why dont his farts smell sweet

Chuck grins Lev shrugs and says something else

TRANSLATOR
He says thats just the way it is

CHUCK

COLIN PARKER-BOWLES the European operations manager -- ona

LARGE TV SCREEN in front of her London is superimposed

So why was Milan late Colin

COLIN
One of the race horses coming from
Ireland got colic and had to be off-
loaded in Brussels That put the Jumbo

the dutiable items

Colin continues as Chuck out of breath slips under the

on

screen and heads for the one remaining vacant seat -- across

from Stan Next to Stan is MAYNARD GRAHAM an MBA systems

man Becca addresses a question over to Stan

BECCA
Stan can we get PandA down to work with
Milan customs

STAN

justifies delaying IP product especially
at Christmas

button Another face comes on the screen Oakland appears

under the face
BECCA
Stand by Benson were still wrapping up
foreign

She turns pointedly to Chuck

BECCA

CHUCK
Becca as you know St Petersburg was
consistently running late by six to ten
hours -- sometimes a full day or more I
replaced the station manager We
identified inefficiencies and worked out
a quality improvement plan I believe can
be met

MAYNARD
You replaced the station manager with a
driver A local with no knowledge of our
systems

BECCA
Shouldnt you have brought in someone
from Memphis Russia is priority one

MAYNARD
James Pottinger is available

The process is being ripped out of Chucks hands He
struggles to get an answer

going through their checklists Chuck repeats his familiar
patter
CHUCK

INT FEDEX PLANE - NIGHT - HOURS LATER

Settled into the jump seat Chuck finishes up his notes on
his PowerBook and begins his flight ritual

He puts in his ear plugs and takes out his Valium He
swallows one then thinks and swallows two more Then he
turns on his Walkman to the Rolling Stones puts the mask
over his eyes and as usual goes to sleep

DISSOLVE TO
INT FEDEX PLANE - NIGHT

The plane is SHAKING badly HEAR frantic garbled radio
talk Chuck stirs struggles to his feet drowsy and
drugged

INT FEDEX PLANE - CHUCKS POV

Everything is hazy out of focus as it was in his earlier
drugged condition But this is real haze SMOKE And the
cabin also TWISTS and TILTS

Chuck tries to steady himself against the wall This is
nightmarish Is this really happening

INT FEDEX PLANE - CHUCKS POV - COCKPIT

The pilots wrestle with the controls They have their life
jackets on John glances back at Chuck his face floating in
a cloud of fear

INT FEDEX PLANE - MOMENTS LATER

Chuck struggles to put on his life jacket The plane is
VIBRATING VIOLENTLY He cant get the straps straight He
is KNOCKED against one wall then another then to the floor

Chuck tries to blow on the mouth tubes for his life jacket
Cant do it Puff Puff Shit John motions frantically
for Chuck to pull on the automatic inflators on his jacket
Chuck fumbles for them

Huge palettes shift and groan one BREAKS FREE banging
violently against the side of the plane spilling out its
boxes Then it swings and KNOCKS Chuck on the head He goes
down
INT GLOBAL OPERATIONS CENTER - MOMENTS LATER

A CONTROLLER mans the global operations desk His SUPERVISOR
stands behind him sipping some coffee The mood is eerily
calm An assistant moves Plane Locator Cards on a giant
board

CONTROLLER
Jumbo 14 is overdue in Sector K

SUPERVISOR
Where are they

Another CONTROLLER tracks a giant computer screen

CONTROLLER 2
Somewhere east of Port Moresby Guam is
getting a signal but no location Maybe

The signal flashes but is strangely still compared to the
others which are moving

EXT FEDEX PLANE - NIGHT

The giant plane PLUMMETS down from the sky

INT FEDEX PLANE - NIGHT

Chuck is semi-conscious and bleeding from the head John
pulls the inflators on Chucks life jacket which fills with
a WHOOSH sending Chucks arms out to the sides Al
struggles with the LIFE RAFT Its all blurred frantic
terrifying

EXT PACIFIC - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER

The plane hits the ocean with a CRASH and a WAVE of water
INT GLOBAL OPERATIONS CENTER - MOMENTS LATER

The Controller is speaking mechanically into the microphone

CONTROLLER
Guam I need a fix on Jumbo 14

EXT PACIFIC - NIGHT

Shrouded with fog and surrounded by debris the tail of the
big plane slowly SINKS beneath the angry storm-driven waves
EXT PACIFIC - DAY

A life raft is tossed on dark storm-driven seas Inside it
semi-conscious Chuck hangs on

EXT PACIFIC - NIGHT

We catch glimpses of the yellow lift raft in the dark as the
storm continues

EXT BEACH - EARLY MORNING

The storm has ended Waves lap gently on a beach cut like a
scallop out of a rocky shore On the beach we see scattered
FEDEX BOXES And we see face-down half-buried in sand a

MAN IN A SUIT and a life jacket

Chuc

The tide gently rocks him laps at his face He chokes
lowly he gets to his knees Vomits seawater big heaves

e rolls over sits down Dazed Still confused Where am
What happened

Hmw

Chucks first instinct is to check the time He looks at his
watch taps it in frustration

Then he looks around and we look with him
CHUCKS POV - BEACH

The fog has thinned We can see palm groves and mangrove
thickets leading back into a thickly wooded valley climbing
up a steep rocky hillside The rocks on the opposite point
end in a barren ridge Clouds hide the top of the hill

ON CHUCK

as he takes in his surroundings He licks his lips Hes

thirsty But something he sees is even more important We
stay with him as he WALKS He comes to a FEDEX PACKAGE in

the sand picks it up brushes off the sand walks farther
He picks up another package

EXT BEACH - WIDE

Chuck walks down the beach picking up FedEx packages
leaving a trail of footprints in the sand Ahead of him we
notice a package decorated with ANGEL WINGS

EXT BEACH - LATER THAT MORNING
Chuck has made a neat stack of FedEx boxes under some palm
trees at the rim of the beach He examines the Angel Wing
drawing with passing curiosity then puts it on the stack

Chuck takes off his life jacket sits down in the shade
makes himself comfortable and waits

EXT BEACH - SUNSET

Chuck is still waiting Hes a systems man and the system
isnt working

CHUCK
All right guys Im here Check the
GPS get moving

EXT BEACH - NIGHT

The full moon shines a ghostly light on the beach Trees
cast moon-shadows on the sand Chuck seems very very alone

We HEAR from the dark thickets a STRANGE NOISE Rustling in
the leaves Something crashing in the trees or is it a
wave A jolt of adrenaline courses through Chucks body He
lurches to his feet

We HEAR the noises again Chuck edges toward the rocks at
the barb of the hook Keeping his eye on the thicket he
bends down and picks up a stone His first weapon

In the rocks he finds a piece of driftwood He picks it up
in his other hand He backs between two rocks and stands
facing the thicket every sense alert A cloud passes over
the moon The shadow streaks across Chucks anxious face

EXT BEACH - MORNING

The morning TIDE is coming in We follow the tide as it laps
amidst the rocks and finds Chuck staring out to sea The
empty sea

CHUCK
Where the fuck are you

But now he is really thirsty We WALK with Chuck up the
beach

Beneath the palms he sees a couple of coconuts He picks one
of them up and studies it Its heavy almost the size of a
volleyball How to get in it
He throws it down on a rock The coconut just bounces off
He wedges the coconut between two rocks then throws a rock
down on it It bounces off He throws down a bigger rock
It smashes on the rocks and chips Chuck picks up the rock
OW Where the rock had chipped the edge is sharp It cuts
him

CHUCK
Sonofabitch

The blood stains the rock a bright red Chuck sucks on his
finger then he gets an idea -- the same idea primitive man
first got when he discovered stone tools

He picks up the rock test the edge Sharp -- really sharp
He throws another rock down but it doesnt break He picks
up another rock and strikes the first one Then again
harder And again A large flake shoots off This edge is
even sharper

He has a knife

OPENING THE COCONUT - SERIES OF SHOTS

Chuck uses the stone knife to saw at the coconut No luck

Chuck clumsily sharpens a stick with the sharp rock

Chuck brings the sharpened stick down hard on the coconut
ut the stick slides off sending the coconut rolling away

oO

Chuck positions the stick pointed end up in a hole then
SLAMS the coconut down hard on it Success The green nut
of the coconut splits The brown inner nut is free He
smashes the nut with a rock but -- OW -- he hits his hand

Chuck licks his fingers but he is so thirsty theres no more
saliva He smashes again The shell breaks to smithereens
Coconut milk splashes everywhere

CHUCK
That was smart really smart

Rotating a nut along its axis and carefully moving his
fingers out of the way he SMASHES the nut again The shell
splits The precious liquid splashes out Left inside is a
swallow or two which Chuck laps up eagerly The milky white
liquid dribbles down his face

CHUCK
Ahhh

EXT BEACH - SUNRISE
Chuck squints at the ocean His sunburn is bad -- his lips
are cracked A stack of broken coconut shells is beside him
No ones there -- again

CHUCK
Maybe the GPS malfunctioned That Korean
airliner did

Clouds scud in front of the sun Beyond the reef the waves
are high and churning Chuck can see them pound onto the
reef

CHUCK
Okay do the math Maybe they know where
you are within say 500 miles Thats a

circle with an area of uh pi r squared
So uh 250000 times three point one
four thats about 800000 square miles
Three times the size of Texas

This sinks in Then Chuck gets an idea

CHUCK
They could use a satellite

But even that doesnt give him much hope

CHUCK
Say each satellite photo is 30 feet
square thats uhfuck itbillions
and billions of photos

That sinks in

CHUCK
Aw someone will come

EXT BEACH - NIGHT

Chuck sleeps by the coconuts The tide is coming in Chuck

stirs gets up staggers over to a palm tree to relieve
himself

He stares idly out at the moonlight on the waves Then not
so idly Somethings out there something floating on the

tide

CHUCK
What the hell

EXT BEACH - MOMENTS LATER
Chuck splashes into the gentle surf reaches the dark object

Its a body Chuck turns it over Its Al one of the
pilots his face gray and waterlogged and very dead

CHUCK
Oh Jesus

EXT BEACH - MOMENTS LATER

Chuck drags the body up on the beach and then collapses
exhausted He sits by it staring at it

CHUCK
Im so sorry Al So sorry

EXT BEACH - MORNING

Chuck has almost finished a grave in the sand back of the
palm trees Hes been digging with a piece of driftwood
sharpened with his stone knife

He drags the body into the pit Stares down at it That
could be me

CHUCK
Got to cover Al up

He wants to say more cant He scoops some sand over the
body

CHUCK
Got to cover Al up

He scoops in some more sand Its eerily like burying the
tropical fish in his back yard

EXT BEACH - LATER

With a rock Chuck hammers a crude driftwood marker into the
sand

EXT BEACH - LATER THAT DAY

As Chuck sits on the beach he half-sings half-talks Yellow
Submarine very quietly to himself

CHUCK
We all live in a yellow submarine yellow
submarine
He looks over at the deep woods and down to the rocky point
Comes to a decision He takes a drink of coconut picks up
his club and a coconut sticks the stone knife in his pants
Hes ready to go

EXT BEACH - DAY - MOMENTS LATER

Chuck climbs over the rocks and disappears out of sight
Hes still half-singing to himself

CHUCK
Yellow submarine We all live ina
yellow submarine

EXT ISLAND - DAY - MOMENTS LATER

Chucks way is blocked by rocks and jungle He hesitates
He picks up a rock and THROWS IT to scare away all those bad
things It crashes into the ferns and palm trees He takes
a step into the jungle

EXT JUNGLE - MINUTES LATER

Chuck struggles through a dense thicket beneath a jungle
canopy Vines and creepers reach out toward him There is
no path nothing to show him where to go

EXT JUNGLE - HALF HOUR LATER

Chuck climbs through a tangle of vines and ferns He takes a
drink from the coconut he is carrying The last drink

CHUCK
Bad idea Should have saved some

He throws away the husk He looks up but the only sunlight
reaching him is dappled from the canopy above him

EXT ISLAND - MOMENTS LATER

Chuck emerges onto a ridge that leads to a summit He climbs
across a rocky lava field covered with scrub lichen and low
ferns soil dark as coffee beans his way crossed by steep
gullies that cut like dark fingers into the lava

The lava field narrows forcing Chuck closer to the sea He
passes a series of CAVES their mouths dark and mysterious
and scary He gives them a wide berth

EXT ISLAND - CLIFF - MOMENTS LATER

The land narrows to a ledge that stretches across a high
cliff perched over the ocean Beyond this rock bridge the
path smoothes out to a summit

Chuck stares at the narrow bridge then down at the waves
breaking on the rocks far below To get any view he will
have to cross the bridge Hes thirsty The late afternoon
sun is hot

CHUCK
Other than that Mrs Lincoln how did
you enjoy the play

Hugging the wall of the cliff taking each step with great
caution he sets out across the bridge

EXT ISLAND - CLIFF

Step by step Chuck negotiates the narrow bridge He reaches
a flume of polished basalt which cuts across the ledge like a
slide in a water park -- except this flume ends high above
the waves Chuck tries to step across it cant quite tries
one foot first then the other

CHUCK
Shit

He looks back but that seems even scarier

CHUCK
Got to get there Got to see Cmon
cmon Dont be such a wuss Be bold

He looks down at the ocean beneath him closes his eyes and
jumps Its only a few feet but hes breathing hard when he
lands on the other side He hugs the rocks getting his
breath

EXT ISLAND SUMMIT - SUNSET - MOMENTS LATER

Chuck looks to each point on the compass He is on an
ISLAND small inhospitable without sign of habitation or
anything human On three sides the waves break against
steep hostile cliffs A reef encloses the cove where he
came from

CHUCK
No way on No way off

Chuck stares out to sea in every direction Nothing

CHUCK
This is bad Really really bad
The last rays of sun hit his face The ocean turns a deep
reddish gold

EXT CLIFF - MOMENTS LATER

Going down is even scarier Its dusk and the light is flat
and gray Chuck stares at the ledge

CHUCK
Come on Crawl if you have to

Chuck crawls on his hands and knees across the rock bridge
EXT ROCKY SLOPE - MOMENTS LATER

Chuck stumbles over the rocks The caves look ominous and
primal

EXT EDGE OF JUNGLE - NIGHT

Its getting dark now The jungle seems impenetrable the
dark wood of fable Chuck hesitates then plunges into it

EXT JUNGLE - NIGHT MINUTES LATER

The moon has just begun to rise casting eerie light into the
jungle The shadows reach out to grab Chuck then real
branches and vines tug at him He heads into thick
blackness

EXT BEACH - NIGHT - LATER

Chuck emerges around the rocks He reaches the stack of
familiar FedEx boxes -- Ahh home Hes breathing hard from
both fear and exertion

CHUCK
Got to drink Got to drink something

With his last strength he opens a coconut on the stick He
bangs hard on the shell and gulps down the milk He stares
at the stack of FedEx boxes What could be inside He
reaches out and touches one

CHUCK
They dont belong to you

Responsibility gets the better of necessity and he takes his
hand away

EXT BEACH - MORNING
Face red from the sun Chuck hacks at a palm frond with his
stone knife He saws the palm frond off near the base
leaving it about a foot long

CHUCK
Got to have shade Got to have a hat

He ties the loose fibers into a sort of circle then sets it
upon his head It looks amazingly like some sort of
primitive cap

He grabs a couple of FedEx boxes and heads for the beach

EXT BEACH - LATER

Chuck finishes the P on H E L P which he has spelled out
with the FedEx boxes on the beach

EXT JUNGLE - DAY - LATER

Chuck scrambles down a ravine He kneels down and feels the
ground It is dry completely dry

EXT LAVA SLOPE - DAY

Chuck traverses the slope determined to find water
A FLAT ROCK - LATER

With a puddle of dirty water trapped in a tiny hollow
Suddenly Chuck flops down into frame He tries to scoop up
some water in his hands but he just splashes it around He
licks his fingers Then he gets down on his stomach and laps
up the water with his tongue Like an animal

In the bottom of the small depression is some fine mud He
rubs it on his reddened face and across his burned lips

CHUCK
Oh God Thank you

EXT BEACH - NIGHT

Chuck lies in darkness his eyes reflecting the moon

EXT JUNGLE - DAY

Chuck is drenched in sweat He is at the bottom of a hole

six feet deep He takes one last dig with the flat stick
then licks the moist clay that sticks to it
EXT BEACH - DAY

Chuck breaks open another coconut and gulps down the milky
liquid With a stone knife he digs in the shell for some of
the meat but its dry and chewy and fibrous He spits it
out then lies back on the sand and stares at the first
stars Half sings to himself

CHUCK
You deserve a break today

He is desperately thirsty Hunger gnaws at him
EXT BEACH - DAY - LATER

Holding a sharpened stick Chuck wades in the shallows at low
tide looking for fish Its difficult to keep his balance
Suddenly a shadow flashes by glinting in the morning
sunlight Chuck hurls the spear which ricochets off the
water and floats away

Chuck plunges into the water after the fish with his bare
hands The fish reverses direction Chuck leaps after it
and goes under He comes up spluttering on his hands and
knees in the shallows

Suddenly a whole school of fish swims by him moving in
unison like one creature splitting around Chuck like
mercury He grabs at them desperately Nothing

CHUCK
Damn fish

On some rocks he sees clusters of limpets He takes a rock
and tries to dislodge one but it smashes into a soggy mess

EXT BEACH - DAY

Discouraged he sits down on the beach and gets his breath
Idly Chuck takes out his wallet The money is soaked He
lays it out to dry He finds a PHOTOGRAPH OF KELLY soaked

and mushy

He tries to smooth it out For a moment he is overcome His
face tightens his eyes get moist He stares out to sea

CHUCK
Wait a minute Wait just a minute

He picks up his wallet again and takes out a credit card
EXT BEACH - MINUTES LATER

Chuck wades in the water stops by a rock covered with
limpets He uses a CREDIT CARD to scrape off a limpet

CHUCK
Dont leave home without it

With his finger he prods around in the mucous-like meat
then tilts up the shell and we see the gooey gray stuff slide
off the shell into his mouth

CHUCK
Yuck

He starts to spit it out Tries to make himself like it

CHUCK
Yumm

And he swallow it
EXT BEACH - SUNSET

Chuck sits in the shade of a palm tree surrounded by a pile
of smashed coconut husks and a stack of limpet shells He
checks his watch for a moment

CHUCK
Got to get this fixed

But whats the point Everything that was so valuable before
is useless now

EXT JUNGLE - LATER

Chuck digs yet another hole He chants to himself almost
delusionally

CHUCK
Water water everywhere water water
everywhere

Covered in sweat desperate and exhausted he throws down his
wooden spade

CHUCK
Wheres the water on this fucking island

He lies on his back breathing hard Pulls his hat over his
eyes
CHUCK
Just rest a minute

EXT JUNGLE - DAY - LATER

Chuck is lying in the hole We find his feet Slowly water
is oozing out of the clay a puddle is building around his
toes

EXT JUNGLE - DAY - LATER

Chucks eyes snap awake He looks down at his feet Theres
a pool of muddy water there He dips his hand in it touches
a finger to his lips to be sure hes not dreaming

He grabs his sharpened stone begins to attack the clay

CHUCK
Oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah

EXT BEACH - SUNSET

Chuck carefully makes marks on a palm tree with his rock
knife One for each day Very neat Very precise Very
Chuck

CHUCK

Lets see I waited two days

(makes marks)
Then I buried Al

(slowly makes another mark)
Al You never made it home buddy Then
American Express got me those clam
things

(makes another mark)
I dug all those damn holes the clouds
over the moon

(makes more marks)
And today the historic discovery of H
Two Oh

(makes a tenth mark and

underlines it)
Ten days Shit

For a moment he feels the weight of his isolation Then he
allows himself a deep breath There is order now after all
Time is under control

EXT CLIFF - DAY

Very carefully but standing this time Chuck makes his way
across the ledge
EXT SUMMIT - DAY

He emerges on the top takes a drink from a hand-made
canteen and looks in all directions Again he sees nothing
but ocean

EXT BEACH - DAY

He resumes his efforts at fishing A shape scuttles raggedly
beneath him

CHUCK
A crab its a crab

He freezes holding his spear motionless Then he jabs at
the crab -- misses The crab scurries away toward the rocks

CHUCK
Dammit

Chuck splashes after it stabbing as he goes falling
getting up stabbing again

Suddenly one stab feels different Chuck carefully lifts up
the spear On the end is a squirming crab

CHUCK
I did it I did it

He walks carefully with it to the beach Lowering the spear
he lets the crab slip off It darts toward the water Chuck
heads it off trying to avoid the snapping claws

He kicks it back toward the beach then slams a rock down on
it He twists off a crab claw expecting to see flaky white
meat But a crab has an exoskeleton The flesh simply pours
out like mucous

CHUCK
Jesus

This is too much He needs the next step from the raw to
the cooked The crucial next step from primitive man to the
beginnings of civilization

EXT PALM GROVE SERIES OF SHOTS - TRYING TO MAKE FIRE

Chuck rubs two sticks together Nothing

Chuck positions a makeshift drill in a hole he has scooped
out in a piece of driftwood He spins the drill with great
effort Nothing

CHUCK
Stupid fucking thing

exhausted
He feels like Job

He quits
and blistered

CHUCK
I dont know what I did

EXT BEACH - DAY

He looks at his hands

God
I am really
Really sorry

They are raw

Chuck emerges from the jungle and walks to the edge of the

ocean

He dips his blistered hands into the sea water

then

looks over at the FedEx boxes that spell out HEL P

CHUCK
Dont have a choice do I
He walks over and picks a few boxes up

EXT PALM GROVE - DAY

With his stone knife and spear to help
open the FedEx boxes Chuck rips open

Chuck tears another box open
covered with Post-its

In quick cuts

some designer dresses flowers a pair

Out tumble some videotapes

from the P

him Chuck begins to
the end of one box and
Chuck looks at them

Out slide some legal papers

we see him dump out computer memory boards

of roller blades a

script with a red cover -- which he never reads

EXT BEACH - LATER

By now he has taken all the boxes in the P
He pauses to let the irony of that sink in
He is even more exhausted

surgeons bag and takes two

EXT OTHER SIDE OF ISLAND - DAY

Chuck picks some berries and gingerly tries them Theyre
not bad He eats more Then more What a relief

EXT BEACH - NIGHT

Chuck lies on his palm fronds groaning and holding his
stomach He drags himself to his knees crawls a few feet
and throws up in great violent heaves

EXT BEACH - DAY

Still looking a little green Chuck marks another day on his
tree calendar

EXT SUMMIT

He stares out to sea Nothing

EXT WELL - DAY

Chuck lies on his belly and drinks from the well which has
filled with water Then he washes his face and splashes
water over his neck The surface of the well stills
bringing CHUCKS REFLECTION into focus He stares at
himself

Very carefully Chuck shaves with the surgeons scalpel

Chuck checks out his new appearance in the water Much
better A clean start now

EXT BEACH - LATER THAT DAY
He sits in front of his failed efforts to make fire
CHUCK

Youre not getting it hot enough Got to
hold the heat Got to hold the heat
EXT BEACH - LATER

Chuck carefully shaves some tinder Puts it under a piece of
bamboo split lengthwise with a notch cut across it

EXT BEACH - LATER

Chuck uses a bamboo stick to try to make friction in the
split half of the bamboo He saws back and forth with all
his might pressing it down in the groove

EXT BEACH - LATER

Chuck gives one last saw with his bamboo and stops utterly
defeated Its all too much

CHUCK
Sonofabitch

He starts to rub again He breathes hard sweat pours off
his face He is really going for it what the hell A tiny

wisp of smoke appears Chuck saws with even more energy
CHUCK
Come on Come on

The smoke increases Chuck rips away the bamboo grabs the
nest of shavings and blows on it frantically The smoke
flickers and dies Chuck cant believe it

CHUCK
No No No

EXT BEACH - NIGHT

Chuck lies in his bed of palm fronds shivering He looks up
at the stars which blaze furiously

CHUCK
Thats the big dipperOrionor is

know

And he misses her so much A shower of meteors streaks
across the sky as if the very heavens are raining down on
Chuck

Chuck readies his two sticks of bamboo again and begins

sawing with tremendous energy He smells something Is it
smoke He pulls off the log and looks eagerly at the nest of
tinder Theres nothing there

CHUCK
Dammit

He replaces the log and starts wearily to saw again
TIME CUT

The sun has moved in the sky Chuck is still sawing Again
the smoke appears Again sweat pours from his face The
smoke increases He saws even harder His breath comes in
anguished gulps Smoke is curling up now Chuck tears away
the bamboo picks up the nest of kindling and blows on it
gently The smoke increases

He blows some more A fragile crimson spark appears

CHUCK
Careful now careful

He gently places the nest of shavings in the kindling then
blows on it with utmost care as if he were holding life
itself He shreds his money and business cards over the tiny
flame

Suddenly the evening breeze lifts the nest out of the
kindling Desperate Chuck grabs it Trying to shield it
with his body he grabs some palm fronds and jams them into
the sand trying to make a windbreak They rustle and shake
and blow over

The wind blows harder Chuck jams some rocks in a circle to
make an eddy But the fire is out No words now just a
loud primal groan of pure despair

And then into his vision floatssmoke
Chuck looks down A wisp of smoke curls up from the nest of

tinder Chuck blows on it gently Suddenly a tiny tongue of
flame flickers and catches on the kindling

CHUCK
Yes Yes Yes

He feeds in some more twigs more tinder The flames lick
out catch grow

CHUCK
If I ever forgot to thank you God and I
am sure I did thank you now
EXT BEACH - WIDE - NIGHT

The fire burns on the beach Chuck rushes about piling on
driftwood

EXT BEACH - CLOSER

Chuck darts into the jungle and returns dragging a huge log
He throws it on the fire We see his face in the light of
the fire He is exultant He dances He sings at the top
of his lungs Papa-ooo-mow-mow

Chuck throws another huge log on the fire Papa-papa-papa-
0000 The log splutters and explodes sending up a huge
shower of sparks that climb and sparkle in the
darknessuntil they merge with the stars

EXT PALM GROVE - MORNING

Chuck makes a mark on the tree Around it he carves a flame
-- the day he mastered fire

EXT PALM GROVE - LATER THAT MORNING

Chuck sharpens his spear with his stone knife Then he
sticks it in the flame to harden it pulls it out checks it
scrapes some more

EXT BEACH - DAY

Chuck wades in the water with his spear Suddenly he stabs
it down A crab is on the end

EXT BEACH - HALF HOUR LATER

Chuck removes a crab from out of the fire and breaks a
steaming crab claw Chuck takes a bite of the flaky white
meat Ahhh It tastes great He takes another bite -- and
flinches

CHUCK
Damn tooth

He fumbles for his Tylenol and takes two pills
EXT SUMMIT - SUNSET

Chuck stands on the summit looking in all directions Then
something on the island brings Chucks eyes back from their
distant focus on the horizon From down on the beach
beneath the palm grove there curls a thin column of smoke
Chuck lets a bit of pride creep into his face as he sees it
He kneels down and begins to build a signal fire
EXT BEACH - NIGHT - LATER

Chuck curls up in his bed of palm fronds The fire burns
Around it is a large stack of crab shells He stares into
the fire

EXT PALM GROVE - MORNING

Chuck makes another mark on the tree He has circled the
tree with marks several times now

EXT BEACH - DAY

Using a safety pin and some suturing thread Chuck fishes
carefully Suddenly he jerks his hand back On the end is a
flopping fish

EXT PALM GROVE - DAY

Chuck takes a cooked fish off the fire and mixes it with some
breadfruit He eats the soft mixture chewing carefully but
his tooth hurts even worse There are only a few Tylenol

tablets left He carefully cuts one in half and swallows it

EXT SUMMIT - AFTERNOON

Chuck arrives with the wood for the night He stares out to
sea as usual but this time he sees something different

WHALES He sees whales Leaping Broaching Spouting
Water pouring off fins and flukes Moving Going somewhere

CHUCK
Beautiful So beautiful

Chuck stares at them stares until the ocean darkens and he
can see them no more Its late now

Leaving he takes one last look as he always does And
another remarkable sight greets his eyes There on the
horizon just below the evening star is aLIGHT He

stares at it fixed

CHUCK
A star Its a star

But then he stares at it really hard

CHUCK
Its a ship
EXT WOODS - TREE - NEXT DAY

A tree shakes and moves quivers

CHUCK
Timberrr

then slowly falls with a CRASH

CHUCK
I heard that

Chuck holds his surgeons saw over the stump He walks to
another tree and begins to saw his way into the trunk

EXT BEACH - SERIES OF SHOTS

Up above the high tide line Chuck lashes a log to a row of
five logs already joined with vines

CHUCK
No more waiting Take action

Chuck sews several designer dresses together with needle and
suturing thread for a sail

CHUCK
Thats right Take action

He cuts bamboo for the mast He carves driftwood for an oar

He fills gourds with water stores breadfruit and coconut as
he sings Fly Me to the Moon to himself

He ties the sail to the mast and extends it with a bamboo
boom lashed on with palm fiber and video tape He ties on

the doctors kit and the FedEx box with the angel wings

He examines his handiwork a finished raft

He brings out his old life preserver and puts it on then
grabs hold of one corner of the raft to pull it down to the
beach It doesnt budge He tries to pull it again
Nothing He leans his back into it and pushes with his legs
Nothing He collapses on the beach his breath coming in
heaves

CHUCK
How could I be so stupid

He bangs himself on the head over and over
CHUCK
Stupid stupid stupid

EXT PALM GROVE - NIGHT

Chuck throws new firewood on the dwindling fire It comes
back to life Meteors streak again across the sky He
stares at the indifferent stars The moon is almost full
Shadows of palm trees sway on the sand

EXT BEACH - NIGHT

Chuck stands by the edge of the water which shimmers in the
reflected light of the fire A wave come in licks at his
toes Lifts up a coconut husk sweeps it gently out Chuck
watches gets an idea

EXT BEACH - NIGHT

He begins to dig in the sand by the raft He grabs the oar
and digs faster making a trench up to where the raft is

EXT BEACH - MORNING

The rising tide floods water into the trench Chuck rocks
the raft back and forth It floats As the wave recedes it
takes the raft with it Chuck has to run beside it

CHUCK TRYING TO ESCAPE - MONTAGE

Over and over we see Chuck capsize at the reef The first
time he has a bandage on his leg He tries everything --
different rafts different approaches but each time the
ocean spits him back

EXT LAGOON - DAY

Defeated and utterly exhausted Chuck swims back from his
latest failure He wades back ashore with the FedEx box and
throws it on the ground by the palm tree He has tried so
hard to escape so incredibly hard done everything humanly
possible and beyond He rips off his life preserver throws
it into the underbrush then collapses on the beach

CHUCK
Youre too low in the water Too damn
low

Chucks shoulders begin to shake as he is racked with deep
sobs of despair
And then he throws his head back and lets forth from deep
inside himself a SCREAM of rage and anger and pain The
Scream pierces the indifferent natural sounds of the island
the rustling of the breeze the lulling rhythm of the waves
It is powerful disturbing primal

The breeze picks up Behind Chuck the palm trees begin to
sway The tide is reaching up toward the beach The waves
crash louder The palm trees sway even more

Chuck picks up some wet sand and rubs it on his body

CHUCK
Dust thou art -- thats for damned sure
-- and unto dust shalt thou return

A few DROPS OF RAIN begin to fall splashing on Chuck and
sizzling in the fire

Chuck looks up clouds have obscured the sun The wind
blows harder The rain falls harder streaking the sand
Chuck had rubbed on his body STEAM sizzles out of the fire

Chuck looks up disbelieving The bottom falls out of the
heavens -- monsoon rain more rain than you have ever seen
before A long wave rolls up its frothy fingers reaching
for the fire

Forget the raft Forget despair The fire could go out
This is disaster

CHUCK
Shit

He springs into action Chuck grabs an empty FedEx box

With his wooden shovel he frantically SCOOPS SOME COALS out
of the fire as the rain HISSES and POUNDS at them He slides
the coals into the FedEx box grabs some sticks of driftwood
and sets off on a run

EXT WOODS - DAY

Chuck runs through the woods slipping and stumbling Vines
grab at him The rain is so thick he can hardly see

EXT WOODS - MINUTES LATER

Chuck bursts out of the woods into the lava field Smoke
pours out of the FedEx box The coals are about to burn
through

EXT LAVA FIELD - MOMENTS LATER
Chuck stumbles up the slippery rocks dragging the smoking
box His face is drenched desperate

EXT CAVE - DAY - MINUTES LATER

Chuck tumbles into the cave just as the coals burn through
the FedEx box

Using the remains of the box he desperately tries to scoot
the coals into a dry spot

One by one THE PRECIOUS COALS GO OUT

Dripping water off his hands and face he pushes a few
together with his fingers ignoring the burns

CHUCK
Pleasepleaseplease

He stomps on the driftwood and saws at it with his knife He
places this kindling on the coals They sputter and sizzle
Barely catch He fans them with the box A tiny flicker
catches then starts to grow

CHUCK
Firewood I need firewood

SERIES OF SHOTS
On the beach Chuck desperately gathers more firewood in the
driving monsoon He can barely see Driven by the storm

the waves are licking at the palm grove

He runs through the woods Branches whip at his face Roots
tear at his feet tripping him

He stumbles up the lava field Sliding Struggling Barely
able to breathe the rain is so strong

INT CAVE - DAY

He dumps the firewood on the floor of the cave But where
the fire had flickered there is only a pile of wet black
ashes

THE FIRE IS OUT

INT CAVE - NIGHT

Chuck lies on the floor of the cave shivering in the
darkness as the rain falls His fire is out his tooth is
killing him he cant escape
EXT CAVE - NEXT DAY

Chuck emerges from the cave The rain has stopped This is
the absolute lowest His face reflects his pain and despair
Hes trapped Its hopeless Everything he tried to build
is gone

EXT LEDGE - DAY

Chuck slowly walks out on the ledge He stares down at the
waves breaking on the jagged rocks far below

He lets go one hand Then lets go the other He is barely
balanced It looks like a wisp of breeze would blow him
right off He slides one foot to the very lip of the
precipice

Suddenly his foot slips

Instinctively he turns into the cliff grabs for a hold One
hand reaches for a nubbing of rock slips off The other
closes his fingers straining to hold him

He breathes in deep gasps He had wanted to end it come so
close

CHUCK
What the fuck are you doing

His deepest instinct was to survive And that is what he is
going to do

CHUCK
Hang on Just hang on

Slowly he pulls himself back from the edge
EXT BEACH - LATER

Chuck walks aimlessly down the beach feeling the burden of
starting over The beach is littered with seaweed and
flotsam bits of rope plastic bottles He picks up a
plastic bottle That will come in handy

The Chuck sees a SOCCER BALL with Wilson stamped on it in
big black letters

He picks it up holds it tosses it up in the air Then he
kicks it then kicks it again then runs down the beach
trying to kick it and keep it out of the water Feeling joy

again even here
INT CAVE - THAT DAY

The sun is setting on his darkened cave The soccer ball
sits in the corner by the black cold ashes of what was once
his fire

Chuck carves a bit of coconut meat takes a bite and winces
as the meat hits his sore tooth He tosses the shell ona
small new pile of shells

Chuck shakes out the last half Tylenol tablet He puts the
tablet in his mouth then takes a sip out of his coconut
canteen When the water hits his tooth that hurts too

INT CAVE - MORNING

Chuck mixes a mash of breadfruit and coconut He tries to
pack the tooth with the mash but its so sensitive that even
this hurts He pounds the floor of the cave in frustration

INT CAVE - LATER

Chuck holds a stone chisel and his hammer stone He
positions the chisel against his inflamed tooth But the
thought of what he is about to do is too frightening He
lowers the chisel

CHUCK
Shit Shit Shit

EXT BEACH - DAY

Chuck tries to fill his mouth with sea water The pain is so
great his eyes water

CHUCK
Whoo pig Sooey

He falls back in the water and floats there looking up at
the sky

INT CAVE - LATER

Determined Chuck hold the stone chisel again He raises it
slowly to his mouth and picks up the hammer stone

CHUCK
No pain no gain

He brings the hammer down hard on the chisel The screen
goes BLACK as Chucks SCREAM continues UNDER
FADE IN
EXT OCEAN - SUNRISE - THREE YEARS LATER

The sky takes on the first colors of the day The ocean is
still dark but a few waves catch the first light The
sunrise touches the summit moves down the cliff then lights
the cove On the screen superimpose

1000 DAYS LATER
REFLECTION - WATER

A spear shimmers in the calm morning water Attached to the
spear is a man standing completely still

ON CHUCK

We move up out of the reflection to the real man His legs
are scarred The remnants of a dress wrap around his middle
A stone knife on a neatly mounted haft is stuck in a belt
made of videotape and woven fiber Necklaces of sharks
teeth and shells hang from his neck His hair is long A
coconut frond hat is on his head

The hand wrapped around the spear is scarred and brown as a
berry It holds the spear perfectly still The watch is
gone

We come around slowly until we see Chucks face The eyes
say it all They stare out with a survivors intensity
staring at the water unblinking This is the man who used
to splash futilely about in the water trying to fish

This is the FedEx man who was plugged into the tumult of
activity and energy surrounded by technology and human

activity at its most intense devoted to making seconds

count Now he is utterly alone and utterly still

And now he has all the time in the world

Suddenly without an once of wasted motion he shoots the
spear forward at a low angle It quivers stuck on the
bottom He pulls it out with a practiced twist On the end
is a struggling fish

But this isnt a thrill anymore Its another day at the
office

EXT BEACH - LATER THAT DAY
Chuck makes a mark on a palm tree He has completely covered
three other trees with marks It sinks in how long he has
been here

EXT JUNGLE - LATER

Chuck carries the fish back from the beach Now there is a
well-worn trail

INT CAVE - THAT AFTERNOON

Chuck enters with the fish We are greeted with the well-
ordered lair of a primitive stone-age man

Clam shell spirals weave in and out around the fire hole
Strips of eel jerky and fish hang drying from racks

Tools are lined up neatly digging sticks stone hammers and
saws spears neatly hafted onto shafts drills awls Bits
and pieces of feathers skins bones rags leaves -- are all
neatly arranged Strings and cords hang from hooks Coconut
bowls and cooking rocks form a small kitchen A raincoat and
rain-hat woven of palm fronds is neatly draped over a frame

Evocative pieces of driftwood decorate the room A wind
chime of obsidian flakes sways gently The watch hangs ona
stick

The Angel Box has the place of honor on one side On the
other side the Wilson soccer ball rests on a throne of rocks
Seaweed has been placed on the ball as hair Clam shells
have been stuck on for eyes other shells form a mouth A
tube shell and conch form a pipe

INT CAVE - FIRE - NIGHT

The fish are being smoke under a palm frond Eel skins hang
from sticks roasting Chuck sits by the fire hafting a
stone knife onto a wooden haft

He ties some fiber to a stick then braids it into string
using both hands and his mouth for the three strands

He ties the string tightly around the shaft He does his
work automatically

INT CAVE - NIGHT - LATER
Chuck eats some fish and some mashed breadfruit He chews

each bite his eyes in distant focus The firelight flickers
on his face
EXT CLIFF - SUNRISE

Chuck carries firewood up to the summit He mechanically
adds wood to the fire As he does so something out to sea
catches his eye He stops and stands up

CHUCKS POV - WHALES

WHALES broach out past the rocky point Spouts of water
shoot into the air

ON CHUCK

As he watches them a light comes back into his eyes He
grins Theres a big gap where his teeth had been He turns
and strides down the hill

EXT CLIFF - MOMENTS LATER

He heads across the rock bridge that once had so terrified
him without losing stride Its second nature now

INT CAVE - MOMENTS LATER
Chuck enters the cave picks up the ball and heads out
EXT SUMMIT - EVENING

The signal fire burns A spectacular cloudy sunset lights up
the sky Chuck sits with Wilson on the summit a bowl of
mashed breadfruit in one hand a bowl of roasted eel skin in
another

As Chuck watches the sunset unfold watches the whales going
by in the darkened water he takes some roasted eel chips
dips them into the breadfruit paste and offers one to
Wilson His voice is flat monotonal

CHUCK
Chips Dip

But Wilson declines

CHUCK
No

He takes a big crunchy bite

CHUCK
Another fucking day in paradise
PULL BACK as the sun goes down and Chuck reaches into the
bowl again and dips an eel skin chip in the dip

EXT ROCKY LEDGE - NIGHT - LATER

Torch in one hand Wilson in the other Chuck walks across
the rocky ledge He passes the flume without even noticing

Suddenly his shoe breaks Its sandal made of woven yucca
leaves

He bends down and fixes it then heads on down the ledge
EXT LEDGE - MOMENTS LATER

Chuck makes a casual leap a leap he has made hundreds of
times but this time the sandal comes loose It catches on a
rock and CHUCK FALLS

His hands are cut and bruised He tries to get up cant
Chuck sits back and examines his foot His fingers come back
covered with blood He reaches out to steady himself and
leaves a HANDPRINT OF BLOOD on the rock

INT CAVE - LATER
Chuck wraps his foot in bandages
INT CAVE - LATER

Chucks face is sweaty He looks down at his foot It is
red swollen infected He stands up tries to put some
weight on it The pain is intense

Chuck sticks the scalpel onto some coals to sterilize it He
holds it over his foot takes a breath then jabs in into the
wound The pain is intense Chuck passes out

INT CAVE - NIGHT

Chuck stirs takes a drink weakly tosses on another log and
collapses back on the floor

INT CAVE - DAY

Chuck wakes up trembling shaking wet with sweat He
staggers up His shadow sways on the wall of the cave He
struggles to get another log on the fire He squints at his
only companion the soccer ball

CHUCK
Help me Wilson
He collapses again
INT CAVE - NIGHT

Chuck stirs and squints his eyes He takes a drink of water
He is feeling better He puts another log on the fire and
slowly begins to chew on some breadfruit and dried fish

EXT BEACH - LATER

Chuck slowly wades into the water favoring his injured foot
But something feels different He glances around What is
it And then he sees something perhaps the worst possible
sight

CHUCKS POV - SAIL

A SAIL is moving steadily away from the island
CHUCK

Throws down the spear and waves his arms

CHUCK
No Wait Come back

He runs into the water and starts to swim He is so weak
however he can only make a few strokes He tries to yell as
he swims

CHUCK
Wait Wait

Choking and weak he turns back and drags himself up on the
beach In the bg the sail dwindles into the distance

EXT SUMMIT - LATER

Chuck struggles to the top of the hill His fire has been
extinguished by the rain In the distance far against the
horizon he sees a sail -- or is it a cloud The whiteness
shimmers against the horizon Chuck squints Whatever it
was it is gone Above him some contrails from jets mark the
sky

Furious he kicks his signal fire scattering the burnt-out
coals

EXT BEACH - LATER THAT DAY

Chuck makes a new mark on his calendar tree Then he stops
He CUTS an angry big line under the last mark then hacks
away at the palm tree slashing it with the stone knife
ripping and marking through all his dates Finally the stone
knife breaks in two Chuck drops the broken half and catches
his breath

EXT CAVE - NIGHT

Chuck enters the cave No signal fires burn The island is
dark

EXT SUMMIT - DAY

Chuck stands on the summit staring out to sea Nothing not
even a contrail not even a whale spout

EXT CLIFF - MOMENTS LATER

He is on his way down suddenly he sees something and stops
Its the HANDPRINT the bloody handprint his own handprint

He slowly extends his hand and covers it then pulls it away
Traces it with his fingers

INT CAVE - DAYS LATER

Chuck has the beginnings of an artists studio Several
large clam shells hold paint A few egg shells are lined up
Brushes have been made from roots and feathers

Chuck covers his hand with paint and makes a handprint on the
wall of the cave He stands back and looks at it

INT CAVE - DAY

He chews some berries then holds his hand against the wall
of the cave and spits a dark blue mist around it When he
takes his hand away the silhouette of his handprint remains

INT CAVE - DAY

With the Angel Wing Box as a model Chuck dips one of his
feather brushes in paint and make a tentative line on the
wall of the cave He works hesitantly rubs off a line
tries again

INT CAVE - NIGHT
Chuck is finishing his first figure a crude portrait of a

man -- himself Hard to tell He examines his work He
takes some shells and sticks them on as eyes
Chuck picks up Wilson thinks

CHUCK
You old airhead you need a makeover

He takes some charcoal out of his fire and draws eyebrows on
the ball Then he mashes some berries dips his fingers in
the juice and makes lips He sticks shells on with clay for
eyes Then he looks at the face

CHUCK
Wilson you bad

He sits back and regards his companion He gestures around
the cave at the new paintings

CHUCK
What do you think

But Wilson doesnt have an opinion

CHUCK
You dont share much do you

Idly Chuck takes down the Angel Box

CHUCK
I guess I know how Kelly felt

For a long time he studies the wings on it With a stick he
tries to draw a similar wing on the dusty floor of the cave
Dissatisfied he wipes it away He looks at the Angel Box

Casually he reaches over and cuts it open with a stone knife
Inside he finds two bottles of green salsa Anda letter

He reads over it

CHUCK
You said our life was a prison Dull
Boring Empty I cant begin to tell
you how much that hurt I dont want to
lose you Im enclosing some salsa the
verde you like Use it on your sticky
rice and think of home Then come home
-- to me Well find the spice in our
lives again Together I love you
Always Bettina

Visibly moved Chuck puts down the letter

CHUCK
He never got it
EXT ISLAND - DAY

The monsoon pours down Wind whips the palm trees The
waves are gray and angry tearing at the beach

INT CAVE - DAY

As the rain pours down outside Chuck studies the sodden
ruined photograph of Kelly which is really only a gray mess

CHUCK
Shes probably found someone else I
would have

Chuck dips his finger into one of the bowls of colors and
streaks it slowly across his face To exorcise his
loneliness he will paint on the most expressive canvas there
is his own body

CHUCK PAINTING HIMSELF - MONTAGE

Close-up on scarred fingers as they paint on Chucks face
and body Color on skin Tight dramatic shots of Chuck
being transformed

Chuck takes white paint and covers his hand Then he presses
it into his chest and makes a handprint He draws a yellow
spiral on his leg then takes red and makes jagged lightning
bolts on his chest on either side of the hand

WATER

Shimmers in a gourd Chucks face swims into focus It has
been painted white Looking at himself in the reflection he
dots on blue stars with dark blue from squid ink

EXT CAVE - LATER

The rains have stopped The island is washed bright and
green

ON CHUCK

As he stands up in the cove His face is white with blue
stars Handprints circle his torso flanked by red lightning
bolts Braided cords circle his biceps Bone necklaces hang
from his neck Feathers jut out from his hair

EXT JUNGLE - DAY
Chuck goes from tree to tree making handprints along his
path Chuck was here This is his mark

EXT PALM GROVE - DAY

He covers the calendar trees with handprints Then stops
Sees something Eyes fixed on the beach he walks toward the
shoreline

EXT BEACH - DAY

Chuck emerges from the palm trees and now we see what he had
seen

A FIFTY-FIVE GALLON OIL DRUM

And another one TWO Chuck stares at the barrels

CHUCK
Hello
EXT BEACH - LATER
Chuck sits staring at the oil drums Its almost as if he is

hesitating to take advantage of them That he may not want
really to leave now

Then his inner struggle ends

CHUCK
What the hell are you waiting for

EXT BEACH - LATER
Filled with determination Chuck rolls a barrel up the beach
EXT BEACH - LATER

Using a palm tree as a fulcrum Chuck hauls hard on a rope
made of vines pulling the barrel up off the beach

EXT JUNGLE - DAY

Chuck throws aside palm leaves revealingthe remains of
his raft

INT CAVE - NIGHT

Chuck is drawing with a purpose now And we see what he is
working on The plans for a raft

INT CAVE - NIGHT
Chuck is making a list of what he needs He works intently

CHUCK
Canteens Sea anchor Got to weave
rope Spears A sail

EXT JUNGLE - DAY

Chuck lashes the barrels onto the raft Checks the knots
Lashes more rope

INT CAVE - NIGHT

He sews dresses together with handmade fiber string
INT CAVE - NIGHT

He weaves videotape together to form a sea anchor
EXT BEACH - DAY

Chuck digs a channel toward the raft

INT CAVE - DAY

Chuck constructs a water collection device with some FedEx
boxes some plastic weighted with a stone Explains it to
Wilson

CHUCK
Now Im hoping that if this is airtight
Ill get condensation down here a cup or
so a day If Im careful it should be
enough

INT CAVE - NIGHT

Chuck writes on the wall

CHUCK
If I never return know that here lived
Chuck Noland for four years I drew
these paintings I made these marks

And then I took my fate in my own hands
and set forth to save myself God
willing

EXT BEACH - DAY

Chuck loads the raft which rocks gently in the cove He has
a sail made of designer dresses sewn together with fiber
thread A sea anchor secured by videotape woven together
into a rope Plastic bottles filled with water A signal
kite made of FedEx paper

Then comes the FedEx box with the angel wings Then Wilson

CHUCK
Wilson my main man Time to go

And he gently leads the raft into the lagoon

CHUCK
Wonder what odds Stan would give me on
this Id say 90-10 Against

He jumps onto the raft begins to paddle out toward where the
surf crashes onto the reef

EXT LAGOON - DAY

Waves break against the reef With his paddles Chuck
maneuvers the raft toward the cut in the reef Boom The
wave crashes the water surges through the cut then recedes
with a whoosh

Chuck watches times the waves paddles like mad Hes
committed SCRAPE goes the first barrel then the second
riding the receding wave Hes out

But the next wave is already surging forward It smashes the
raft against the reef Coconuts and foodstuffs hurtle off
the raft

The barrels cushion the impact The raft tilts spins but
stays outside the reef The ropes holding the jugs of water
break The water sweeps overboard

The wave recedes again Chuck recovers paddles with all his
strength and then hes clear of the breakers

For a long moment he floats on the rollers getting his
breath

The water jugs float away carried by the waves back into the
lagoon Chuck could go back and get them If he were being
prudent he definitely would

But hes out He might never get back out again

He stares at the lagoon and the receding water jugs Then he
stares at the island Goodbye to all that
CHUCK
Wilson were out of here

He turns and begins raising the sail

EXT OCEAN - WIDE - MINUTES LATER

Powered by its multicolored makeshift sail trailing its
gently flapping signal kite of FedEx paper the raft slowly

moves away from the island out toward the open ocean

And we pull back until the ocean swallows the tiny raft and
then we TILT DOWN AND

DISSOLVE TO
EXT OCEAN - DAY - FOUR WEEKS LATER

The ocean again low The raft floats into frame A trace
of a breeze flaps the signal kite which barely stays aloft
its rope frayed and tattered The still is set up in the
middle plastic with a rock weighting down the center

Chuck is gaunt his clothes rotted

He lies looking over the side of the raft spear in one hand
staring intently at the water

Dorados swim like specters flashing and darting Chuck
stabs with his spear Stabs again

CHUCK
Slow down damn you

Exhausted he sinks back to the raft Two Dorados leap into
the air ahead of him

Chuck tries to stare again into the water He spots another
fish a flash of silver under the surface

Chuck struggles to his feet raises his spear SPLAT
Something strikes him in the chest almost knocking him into
the water

On the raft we see flashes of silver and green and blue A
FLYING FISH Chuck dives at it catches it loses it

CHUCK
Catch it catch it catch it --

He catches it again just as it almost flops over the side
EXT RAFT - MOMENTS LATER

Chuck sucks the juice out of the head He chews meat off the
tiny rib bones

Chuck is in the stage of malnutrition vitamin deprivation
salt insufficiency and exposure where the personality splits
and becomes external Like all castaways he has
conversations with the two sides of himself

GOODCHUCK
Save some for tomorrow

BADCHUCK
Catch another fish tomorrow

BadChuck wins Chuck keeps eating He stares up at the sun
which beats down unmercifully

EXT RAFT - DAY - LATER

The raft drifts Chuck has taken down the sail and rigged it
as a canopy Drenched with sweat Chuck lies on the raft
trying to sleep He dabs at some sores that are ulcerating
his body and wont let him get comfortable Plus theres a
chaffing squeaking sound He looks around for the source

We see it with him One of the ropes is frayed and about to
break If it does the logs will come apart from the floats

BADCHUCK
Shit Shit Shit

GOODCHUCK
Stay calm identify the problem
Problem rope fraying Solution fix

BADCHUCK
With what Theres nothing to fix it

going to drown

GOOD CHUCK

BADCHUCK
Too tired

murky water

BADCHUCK

GOODCHUCK

GOODCHUCK

Slowly Chuck gets up lifts up the water jar and takes a
swallow Then another

GOODCHUCK
Stop Enough

Then another

EXT RAFT - DAY - LATER

Chuck works to braid a new rope He is focused
concentrating as hard as he can but everything is slow and
hard and hes weak and clumsy He tests the rope but it
doesnt hold

GOODCHUCK
Think Got to use something else

He gets an idea starts to pull the signal kite in

BADCHUCK
If they cant see you whats the point

GOODCHUCK
Survive today thats the point

The kite rope is much thinner than the rope he had used to
tie the logs but its all he has He ties the log with the
kite rope Exhausted he lies back down

EXT RAFT - NIGHT
The moon is full The waves cast off shadows on the ocean

Chuck is staring into the sky trying to find a star to
navigate by
GOODCHUCK
Polaris where are you Maybe Im too
far south

BADCHUCK
You dont know where you are You missed
the shipping lanes

GOODCHUCK
Moons too bright

We hear the fraying sound again

EXT RAFT - DAY

Chuck saws at the outer log with his stone knife Across the

water comes a storm We can see it like a waterfall moving
toward us

BADCHUCK
Youre putting off the inevitable

GOODCHUCK
Im putting it off

He looks at the deteriorating rope at the rotting sail

BADCHUCK
Thats whats happening to you

Chuck pushes the outer log away then takes the loose rope
and begins to lash it around the center logs

BADCHUCK
Youre rotting away

The raft is rocking The waves are stronger Its hard to
tie the logs together

Rain falls like a sheet on Chuck

BADCHUCK
Get water

GOODCHUCK
Fix raft first

BADCHUCK
Water water water --

Chuck works frantically in the rain trying to tie the rope
Finally he does
Then he scrambles for his water collecting funnel struggles
to pull it up One corner is stuck and collapses
Desperately he rights it pulls the funnel up

Drops begin to run down the sides and collect in the jar
Soaked Chuck stares at the water as it rises

Then the rain stops

We see the line of rain recede away from Chuck spattering
the ocean But all around him the ocean is calm again

And out comes the sun
EXT OCEAN - DAY

The raft floats on quiet seas The sky is blue with few
high cirrus clouds so motionless they seem pasted on

Chuck lies on the raft sick and weak

Suddenly from the depths beside him silently rises a huge
shape

A SPERM WHALE still mainly submerged The blow hole is near
Chuck wet and pulsing like giant lips The eye of the whale
is only a few feet away It looks upon Chuck out of an
intelligence deep and alien

He slowly comes to his knees and stares at it

The blow hole opens and WHOOSH out shoots a geyser of fine
spray which settles on Chuck in a mist

The whale rises farther dwarfing the raft From the whale
comes a deep sound like a foghorn

Startled Chuck jumps back rocking the raft He catches
himself slowly reaches out and touches the whale

The whale blows again drenching Chuck in more spray
Chuck touches the whale again

GOODCHUCK
You like that

Very slowly it drifts along with the raft

GOODCHUCK
Lost your mate
We look right into the whales eye Beneath the surface we
can see the huge jaws open and close

GOODCHUCK
Youre beautiful Marry me

BADCHUCK
You idiot if he dives hell capsize the
raft

Very slowly the whale moves ahead of the raft its vast body
passing Chuck

GOODCHUCK
No dont go Look Ive got fish

Chuck rips a fillet off the line and throws it in front of
the whale which ignores it

GOODCHUCK
Please dont dive Please

The whale slowly sinks then suddenly arches its huge back
and heads straight for the bottom

For a moment all that remains are the flukes black and
vertical against the dark blue sky With one swoop those
flukes could destroy Chuck and his raft But they dont do
anything except slowly sink

Then it is gone

We are on Chucks face as he stares at where the whale had
been the surface marked only by a ring of concentric ripples
that reach out and gently rock the raft

EXT OCEAN - DAY

Chuck checks the water It is green and full of floaties
It looks awful He takes the jug puts it to his mouth and
drinks Instantly he throws up back into the jug barely
keeps from dropping it

BADCHUCK
Look what youve done

He dips his hand into the ocean splashes some sea water on
his face splutters it out then licks his lips He is so

thirsty

He looks at the water jug full now with his own vomit turns
away begins to work on the sea anchor again

But the work makes him even thirstier He looks at the jug
again

Picks it up Takes a long drink
EXT OCEAN - DAY

The fish return Chuck gets up with his spear then puts it
down

BADCHUCK
What are you doing

GOODCHUCK
Cant kill another one Cant Cant
kill my friends anymore

BADCHUCK
You fucking bleeding heart you kill or
you die

GOODCHUCK

Why do they have to die for me

BADCHUCK
Theyd eat you if they could Theyre
laughing at you Listen

Chuck listens Doesnt hear anything

GOODCHUCK
Got to eat

Chuck picks up the spear stabs it misses

Suddenly he has a fish on the end of the spear It
struggles he scoops it onto the raft brutally pounds on its
head twists the stone knife into its spine The struggling
stops

Chuck looks at the dead fish and begins to sob

GOODCHUCK
I am so sorry

He cries uncontrollably As he cries he cuts off the head
pulls out the eyeballs and eats each one Then he sucks the

marrow out of the head

Then takes the heart and eats that Then eats the liver
As he is chewing he cuts the meat into strips

When he is done he takes the backbone breaks it and sucks
on it

Fish scales shine in his hair blood covers his chest
EXT OCEAN - NIGHT

The raft rocks gently Chuck looks up The strips of fish
are glowing So is the deck where he killed the fish

He reaches out to touch the fish strips His hand is glowing
too

CHUCK
Im an angel

Suddenly he sees other lights A ship A ship is out there
And he hears it a humming in deep register

He waves his hands He yells

CHUCK
Here Here

His voice cracks we can barely hear it over the ocean
The lights move on

CHUCK
Nonono

His raft is rocked by the wake rocked hard Chuck is thrown
into the water

He comes to the surface sputtering Where is the raft
He looks one way then another Darkness
This is the worst

He turns again in the water There dimly he can see the
glow from the fish he killed The glow saves his life

He swims toward it

He pulls himself back on the raft

He lies there exhausted the glow from the phosphorescence
casting a greenish light on his face
EXT OCEAN - DAY

Clouds are building up In the distance lightning flashes
The clouds come closer

Little bits of electricity jump off the mast Saint Elmos
fire jumps around Chucks hand

Fascinated he holds out his hand The fire jumps from his
hand to the mast

Suddenly lightning shoots from the sky and strikes the ocean
A huge spout of water explodes like a depth charge The
CRACK is intense then rolls away

Chuck stares then realizes the danger and throws himself
down on the raft Suddenly a wall of rain sweeps over him
and the ocean begins to roll The thunder is deafening
Lightning flashes bursts through the rain

CHUCK
Sea anchor Let out the sea anchor

Frantic Chuck lets out the sea anchor as the raft scuds down
a huge wave The anchor catches slowing the raft so that it
rides the wave down

The waves come at him high as houses The raft rides up one
side then plunges down the next

All Chuck can do is hold on
EXT OCEAN - DAY
The storm has passed The raft floats on big dark rollers

We hear the chirping and squeaking of dolphins They come
close to the raft Chuck watches them play Then realizes
they are chasing his fish They drive them along into the
path of another dolphin who darts in and rips into the
dorado turning the water around the raft into churning
bloody foam

CHUCK
Stop

He takes his oar and begins beating the water The killing
continues

CHUCK
You fucking murderers
Suddenly the water is still One dolphin sticks its head out
of the water and stares at Chuck squeaking

Another dolphin lifts its head up then another They squeak
to each other clearly communicating and talking about Chuck

CHUCK
I know youre talking about me

He splashes the water with his oar
They dive then jump into the air squeaking as they go
CHUCK

(very softly)
Take me with you

Theyre gone

CHUCK
Why me Why me God

He begins to laugh

BADCHUCK
Listen to this Wilson
(deep voice God)
Because you piss me off

EXT OCEAN - DAY

Chuck tries to stretch with some simple yoga Each movement
takes forever

He rolls over onto his stomach and tries to do a pushup He
cant Collapses onto the raft

BADCHUCK
Youre falling apart

Tries to do another pushup Cant

BADCHUCK
First you eat your fat then you eat your
muscle
He rolls over
BADCHUCK

Then you eat your mind
He looks at the ocean Theyre in a line of garbage

slick of debris dumped off of ships

GOODCHUCK
Roll on you deep and dark blue ocean
roll

He closes his eyes After a minute they come open

GOODCHUCK
Im late Im late for a very important
date

They slowly close again

BADCHUCK
Im lost Goodbye

GOODCHUCK
No

His eyes come open again

BADCHUCK
Look just slip off the raft The ocean
would feel so good the waters so soft
and warm Take a little swim Sleep

GOODCHUCK
You quitter you quitter you quitter

BADCHUCK
The sea is lovely dark and deep

GOODCHUCK
But I have promises to keep
(rolls over)
And miles to go before I sleep
(props himself up)
And miles to go before I sleep
(purpose now)

Got to fix the sea anchor Use the sail

BADCHUCK
Use the sail for a sea anchor and you
wont move

GOODCHUCK
If I dont have a sea anchor Ill
capsize

BADCHUCK

a thick
Die tomorrow or die today
He hums Beethovens fifth BA BA BA BUM

BADCHUCK
Thats death knocking knocking on your
door Crazy little woman come knocking
knocking at my front door

GOODCHUCK
Grow up stop being such a baby Other
people get through a lot worse

BADCHUCK
Yeah sure what

He hums to himself begins to sing Beatles

BADCHUCK
Im so tired my mind is on the blink

He pulls in the loose sea anchor rope which is covered with
barnacles

He scrapes the barnacle off the rope into the water jug then
sips it

The sun is setting huge rays shoot out across the sky

Out of the empty ocean the Dorados suddenly appear leaping
flashes of silver right by the raft

One Dorado swims right by the raft broadside

Chuck looks at it uncomprehending Then slowly reaches for
his spear

GOODCHUCK
What Are you sacrificing yourself for
me

Carefully he comes to his feet then shoots the spear into
the fish

Flapping and struggling it lands on the deck Chuck pounces
on it

EXT RAFT - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER

He cuts it open The other Dorados ram the raft in fury
like a lynch mob
GOODCHUCK
Damn it I had to do it

The banging continues

GOODCHUCK
Im sorry

He concentrates on his work then sits back on his heels in
amazement Theres another fish inside He holds that fish
up stares at it then cuts it open

Theres a smaller fish inside it

GOODCHUCK
I know theres a moral here God but
right now Im just going to eat

He pops out an eyeball then another and crunches them
between his teeth

He takes the heart and liver starts to eat then stops

GOODCHUCK
Forgot to say grace Sorry Mom

He struggles to remember

GOODCHUCK
Bless us O Lord and these thy gifts and
Christ and the bounty about to receive
or somethingamen

He eats them
EXT RAFT - NEXT MORNING

Chuck splashes sea water on his face Adjusts the water
still

GOODCHUCK
Please dont leak Please

Chuck picks up the smallest fish Its half digested He
washes it in the ocean trigger fish come up and nibble at

his fingers

GOODCHUCK
Dont look at me It was that Dorado

He cuts the small fish and hangs it on the stays
GOODCHUCK
You know Wilson every now and then we
should say thank you Thank you God

BADCHUCK
Thank you for fucking up my life

Suddenly something bumps the raft Hard Then again

GOODCHUCK
Not again

Fins cut the water SHARKS A big hammerhead bumps the
raft BadChuck hums the theme from Jaws Chuck takes his
spear stabs at the shark
BADCHUCK
Hes going to get you going to get
you

Another one circles in bumps the raft

GOODCHUCK
Get away from me

The shark circles again that big hammerhead like a
nightmare

GOODCHUCK
Get him get him get him

He stabs at it with his spear He might as well have stabbed
concrete The shark circle Chuck stabs again

But the shark is gone

GOODCHUCK
Where are you Where are you

Stabs again and again at the empty ocean
GOODCHUCK
Stop Youre using energy Move slowly
Be patient
Chuck kneels wavering on the raft The ocean is calm
Suddenly BUMP The raft tilts

Chuck hangs on

Then a shark appears just out of spear range Its lifeless
black eyes seem to stare right through Chuck

If the Dorado was a gift from God this is a message from
Hell

Then the shark is gone
EXT RAFT - DAY - MOMENTS LATER

Chuck lies back on the raft He is humming

BADCHUCK
What are you smiling about Theyll be
back

GOODCHUCK

Im dancing on the roof of the Peabody
Hotel With Kelly

He smiles at the thought

GOODCHUCK
The music ends We go back to the table
The waiters have brought dinner New
York Strip with Bordelaise Sauce
Mushrooms in brown gravy Roasted
potatoes with garlic and rosemary Green
Beans with almonds Fresh biscuits and
cornbread dripping with butter A nice
salad with ranch dressing A jumbo
shrimp cocktail

Thinks about that it spoils the picture

GOODCHUCK
No shrimp
(then)
We eat
He closes his eyes This is the greatest fantasy
GOODCHUCK

(as the waiter)
For dessert we have pecan pie a la mode
we have a double chocolate cake with
creme anglaise we have a nice pear
torte fresh key lime pie or perhaps if
you care to wait a few minutes a grand
marnier souffle

Chuck thinks over the options thinking of each one
GOODCHUCK
Why bring them all bring them all

He rolls over There square in his vision is a ship its
form coming in and out of a low haze

Chuck jumps to his feet Waves Screams

GOODCHUCK
Here Over here

The ship moves on We can see the decks the rigging the
vastness of it

Chuck realizes he is naked Struggles to pull on the remains
of his pants finally holds them like a diaper with one hand
as he continues to wave

On the ship no one is to be seen It is a spooky sight
The big tanker moves on
We are on Chucks face Passed up again

Then he realizes what is about to happen He throws out the
sea anchor

He throws himself onto the raft and grips it as tight as he
can wiggles his feet into the ropes

CHUCK
Oh shiiiittt

Then comes the wake of the ship It rocks the raft like a
piece of flotsam The raft rides high up on the wave then
shoots down it but the sea anchor holds and the raft slows
and rides along with the wave

And then the sea is calm again

Slowly Chuck sinks to his knees His hand lets loose his
pants

He lies down on the raft and imagines the conversation with
the ships captain

CHUCK
Permission to come aboard sir

CHUCKCAPTAIN
Permission granted
CHUCK
May I ask where are you bound

CHUCKCAPTAIN
San Francisco And you

CHUCK
As it happens Im headed for Frisco
myself

CHUCKCAPTAIN
Would you do us the honor of joining us
Were just sitting down at mess Pork
chops and gravy cranberries baked
potatoes with all the trimmings fresh-
baked bread apple pie

CHUCK
No please join me Some sundried fish
strips a few eyeballs some gills to
munch on

The depression comes back again

BADCHUCK
Theyre never going to see you Youre
just another piece of trash in the ocean

GOODCHUCK
Theyre on autopilot

BADCHUCK
Theyre always on autopilot Or else
its night or youre in the sun or
youre in the trough of a wave Theyll
never see you

GOODCHUCK
Damn it Dont be so negative

Chuck picks up Wilson

GOODCHUCK
Wilson whats your story

He holds Wilson close to his chest

BADCHUCK
I float You sink End of story

GOODCHUCK
Im serious Im always going on about
me me me Enough about me Your turn

BADCHUCK
Its a fucking soccer ball you idiot

GOODCHUCK
Shut up

He lies on the raft and holds Wilson close
We move up until we see --
EXT OCEAN - AERIAL - EVENING

Chuck lying curled up on the raft Wilson cradled in his
arms and all around the vast empty ocean

EXT OCEAN - NEXT MORNING
Chuck slowly wakes up Sets Wilson aside

GOODCHUCK
Dont shirk dont procrastinate dont
be lazy Were okay today Were okay
today

And the other Chuck begins to laugh

GOODCHUCK
Shut up

The laughter goes on

GOODCHUCK
Shut the fuck up I mean it

He stands up and checks the horizon

GOODCHUCK
Whats so damn funny

BADCHUCK
You are

Suddenly Chuck sees something on the horizon A bank of
clouds A cone of -- land

He squints stares again The clouds part It looks like --
his island

Chuck doesnt know whether to feel joy or despair
GOODCHUCK
Jesus

BADCHUCK
Look again asshole Its a mirage

Chuck squints

GOODCHUCK
Its real

BADCHUCK
Nothing out there but ocean

GOODCHUCK
Lets get a second opinion Wilson
What do you see

Chuck picks up the soccer ball holds it up and stares out
atocean

EXT RAFT - DAY - LATER
Chuck slowly writes on the sail

CHUCK
Chuck Noland Born October 8 1958
Died -- pick a date -- July 11 1998
And now the epitaph Met deadlines
Kept appointments Lost without a trace

He sits back looks at the mock headstone

BADCHUCK
What did it matter if FedEx was five
minutes late one day The next day we
just start over again

GOODCHUCK
It matters We do the best we can
thats all we have

BADCHUCK
Then weve just got shit

He goes on writing

CHUCK
I am writing this to remind myself to
live a better life If I am lost
perhaps you who find this will be
instructed to live a better live
yourself Live each day Love your
children Dont take anyone for granted

BADCHUCK
Is that it Life is a fucking Disney
movie

The waves begin to grow the ocean turns a slate gray Far
above him great frigate birds circle Suddenly one dives on
a booby which has caught a fish The great frigate bird
swoops all around the booby until panicked it drops the
fish which plummets toward the sea

With a graceful dive the huge bird grabs the fish and then
soars up on a thermal high into the sky

Lightning flashes back and forth across the horizon which is
turning black and dark Thunder rolls

EXT RAFT - NIGHT

The raft goes up and down huge waves Every few seconds
lightning flashes illuminating the raft and Chuck holding
desperately to it his eyes wild with fear

EXT RAFT - MORNING

The waves continue Chuck holds on his face pale

BADCHUCK
You cant make it

GOODCHUCK
Shut up I dont feel like dying today

EXT OCEAN - DAY - LATER

The sky clears The waves are still big The fish are back
And then come the sharks cutting through the water Chuck
cant get up to get his spear he just has to watch as blood
darkens the water

And then the sharks are gone

Chuck comes to his knees slowly then a big wave hits
Wilson is swept into the ocean

For a moment Chuck is uncomprehending He watches as Wilson
slowly floats away

CHUCK
Please no sharks
Then he dives in to the water Swims frantically after
Wilson

Wilson floats away from him He swims but hes so weak
Finally he gets to Wilson He reaches out but only pushes
the ball farther away

It bobs on the waves Chuck treads water exhausted

Where is the raft

CHUCK
Jesus Jesus Jesus

Then he turns back the other way The raft has drifted by
him He can go after Wilson or he can go after the raft

CHUCK
Shit Wilson

He swims toward the raft barely moving No matter how hard
he swims the raft seems to recede from him

Finally he reaches it hangs on the side breathing hard
choking crying

He struggles to pull himself on board
But he is weak so weak He cant do it

Summoning some primitive reserve of strength he tries again
This time he slides on

He lies on the raft panting

Then with all his strength he pulls himself to his feet
holds on to the mast scans the ocean for Wilson

CHUCK
Wilson

Nothing but waves

This is too much Chuck starts to cry

EXT RAFT - DAY - LATER

Chuck takes a swallow of water washes it around in his

mouth then swallows With his wet tongue he licks his
cracked lips
The sun breaks through the clouds

With what strength he has left Chuck raises the canopy
fastens it

He sits in the meager shade his head between his knees
Closes his eyes Just for a minute
EXT OCEAN - DAY - LATER

A different sort of shadow crosses Chucks face He opens
his eyes

There riding right beside his raft is a ship a huge rusty
tanker Someone shouts down in a language we dont
understand

Chuck sits up cant believe it Struggles to cover himself

EXT OCEAN - DAY - LATER

Chuck is lifted up the rusted steel side of the boat ina
Jacobs ladder

EXT SHIP - DAY - LATER

Chuck steps on board cant support himself

The crew gathers around None of them speak English but
there is a spontaneous outburst of human connection

One man brings some water Another a blanket Another some
warm tea

Chuck sits there shivering now

CHUCK
Thank you Oh thank you

Deliriously happy Delirious
INT US NAVAL HOSPITAL - HAWAII

A cavernous hanger-sized ward brightly lit and filled with
row upon row of hospital beds each with its table side
chair and lamp each with a stainless steel bedpan and
neatly folded sheets and blankets stacked ready to use and
each completely empty

Except for one
And on that bed we see Chuck in a blue hospital gown An IV
drips into his arm He plays idly with the remote control of
the bed He raises the head then the foot He pushes
another button and the knee rest bends the bed again

A DOCTOR enters carrying a thick chart Chuck gives him a
big manic grin Malcolm MacDowell in A Clockwork Orange

CHUCK
My favorite doctor Whats the verdict

DOCTOR
Under the circumstances your overall
health is good Those salt water boils
you picked up on the raft are ulcerated
but theyre healing nicely

He checks his blood work records

DOCTOR
Hemoglobins 108 -- youre anemic
thats why were giving you iron
Potassiums low -- were giving you an

electrolyte solution with your IV
Sodiums over 150 way too high You may
experience swelling in your extremities
as you rehydrate and discharge the salt
In spite of your dietary deficiencies
theres no sign of mental deterioration

Chuck has been trying not to laugh Now he cant stop
himself

DOCTOR
Whats so funny

Chuck cant seem to help laughing at everything

CHUCK
Sorrysorry Why do my joints still
ache

DOCTOR

Dehydration Vitamin deficiency
Protein deficiency Any or all of the

above

CHUCK
All I ate was fish Thats solid
protein

DOCTOR
Protein digestion is very costly in water
usage

CHUCK
Which I didnt have

DOCTOR
And fish are very low in fat which is
energy inefficient So youre going to
burn up your own cells no matter how much
you eat Luckily you ate the eyes and
pancreas which contain some Vitamin C
so you didnt get scurvy

Chuck laughs again

He starts

CHUCK
I am one lucky guy

DOCTOR
Your body chemistry and your exposure to
the elements would normally lead to
irritability depression anxiety
periods of self-reproach Its almost
like schizophrenia Different sides of
your personality might come to life
speak out act out

CHUCK
But all thats behind me Im fine now

to laugh again

DOCTOR
If you say you are

CHUCK
I most definitely say I am

DOCTOR
Doctor Hegel tells me he discussed the
Vietnam POW syndrome with you

Chuck stifles his laughter

CHUCK
Yes yes he did

DOCTOR
You are aware of the potential
disruptiveness on your loved ones when
you return to your old life
CHUCK
Not to mention on me

The laughter again Unsettling

DOCTOR
You sure you dont want some counseling

Chuck gives his biggest smile

CHUCK
Doc Im not on the island Im not on
the raft Im alive Im so glad to be
back I cant tell you I just want out
of here

DOCTOR
Well when that IV runs out youre
through with us Just the dentist
tomorrow

INT HOSPITAL - NIGHT - LATER

EXT HAWAII - BEACH RESTAURANT

A terrace by the ocean Tables filled with diners Food
being delivered by waiters So simple eating So taken for
granted

At one table sits Chuck dressed in a Hawaiian shirt and
shorts with a half-dozen plates in front of him He
gestures to the waiter Bring me more It all tastes so
damned good

Behind him is the ocean Chuck doesnt glance at it
INT DENTIST - NEXT DAY

An attractive DENTAL TECHNICIAN with an Australian accent
cleans Chucks teeth with an ultrasound device Shes close
very close Chuck looks up at her She looks really good
She smiles at him then touches the gap where he knocked out
his tooth

TECHNICIAN
You sure you dont want to have the
implant done here We do quite good
work

Chuck shakes his head no She scrapes behind his front
teeth

TECHNICIAN
Hmmm you do have such a lot of tarter
behind these front incisors A little
wider please

Chuck opens his mouth even further The technician talks on
in the self-absorbed way dental technicians sometimes do
that constant babble of human contact which Chuck has not
heard for four years

TECHNICIAN
Anyway so the second prosthetic foot
worked better but he still couldnt
drive his new Cortina it being a
standard shift if you follow me

Chuck nods I follow you
TECHNICIAN
But would he hear of me driving him
around Not on your bloody life Rinse

Stan notices the technician

He says this with an absolute straight face holding back the
laughter with great effort Instantly theres this
connection again between him and Stan

TECHNICIAN
Ex-boyfriend

STAN

And he and Chuck make eye contact and we see a glimpse of
their shared unspoken irony

STAN
Uh theres somebody out here who wants
to see you

Chuck stares sharply at him Kelly Stan nods but theres
something he wants to say
STAN
She thought you were dead We all did

Thats not all Stan wants to say But Chuck is limping out
the door

INT DENTIST - WAITING ROOM

EXT HAWAII - DAY

Chucks raft sits up on a dock Kelly stands staring at it
How small and fragile it looks

STAN

Stan examines the ropes around the logs

STAN
Cool ropes

CHUCK

STAN
Must have taken a hell of a long time

CHUCK

Kelly points at something on the raft

KELLY

KELLY

CHUCK
The tide came in the tide went out I

KELLY

Dont overwhelm me with the details
(she smiles remembering)
You know how I hate that

He tries to put it into words isnt quite sure how

KELLY
(gently)
Come on Try

CHUCK
Cliches mainly Dont take anyone for
granted Dont sweat the small stuff
Live each day like its your last

KELLY
So simple to say so hard to do

CHUCK
Not when you have no choice

Kelly looks down at the raft Its so small

KELLY
You hated being alone Couldnt stand
it Busy every minute Always plugged
into something

CHUCK
I didnt know what really being alone
was No one back here does

He has something more to say She waits

CHUCK
Were not meant to be alone Not like
that Share life thats what came to me
out there Be with someone

And thats the point isnt it We are social animals
man is an island

KELLY
This is so unfair

CHUCK
Thats what I told the fish I caught
But I ate them anyway

And the laughter comes again Kelly grins embarrassed
little worried

KELLY
You okay

CHUCK
Great Really

No

She stares at his face reaches out touches it again this
time with great tenderness

He nods

her touch feels so good

A wave of emotion comes over her pity love

We hear a distant beep-beep

KELLY

KELLY

raft watching her go

INT FEDEX PLANE - NIGHT

Chuck and Stan ride on the plane Chuck is coming down off
his survival high He has the Angel Wing FedEx package with
him

STAN
When I first showed up I thought youd
lost your fucking marbles

CHUCK
I never thought it would end Then it
did It was so great to be saved I
couldnt stop laughing

Stan pulls a flask out of his bag

STAN
You need a drink

Stan takes two glasses from his bag rests them on a FedEx
container and pours the whiskey

CHUCK
For years my only drinking buddy was a
soccer ball Wilson
Stan hoists his glass

STAN
To Wilson

CHUCK
To Wilson

Nows when Stan gets to the question hes been wanting to
ask that Kelly wanted to know that we all want to know

STAN
So whats it all about

Chuck stares at him

STAN
Youve been over the line and you came
back Youve been saved hallelujah

CHUCK
Hallelujah

Stan looks over at him

STAN
Im serious The burning bush the big
picture the words in neon

CHUCK
Whats it all about Its about being so
thirsty youd crush a fishs backbone to
suck out the spinal fluid -- thats what
its about

Stan sits back repulsed but relieved
STAN
Do what it takes Thats what I always
told you

He pours another drink

STAN
To life Fuck em if they cant take a
joke

CHUCK
To life

STAN

Thats all there is
CHUCK
Believe me I know

He takes a sip of his drink just savoring it thinking

CHUCK
But its not being bold or being in the
game or rolling the dice

All those things Stan used to tell him

CHUCK
When I was going crazy on the raft Id
argue with myself about everything
Because everything had a price To get
anything -- a sip of water a little
corner of shade an hours sleep -- I had
to let go of something else And then I
could never get it back

He thinks some more

CHUCK
You dont win or lose You win and lose

He looks out the window

CHUCK
You win and lose

And Chuck has Big time

scene not really listening

loneliness Like Lazarus Chuck has come
