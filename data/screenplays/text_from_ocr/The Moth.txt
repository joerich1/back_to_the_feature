TEASER

THE SOUND of DISCORDANT GUITAR CHORDS rises as we PUSH
THROUGH the “O” of the LOST logo and SLAM INTO --

AN EYE BLINKING OPEN GLASSY Huge DILATED PUPIL
Struggling to FOCUS CUT OUT to find the eye belongs to --

INT THE VALLEY - CHARLIE’S CAVE - EARLY MORNING (DAY 8) 1

CHARLIE -- who probably hasn’t slept all night -- sitting on
an upper tier cave with his GUITAR struggling to find chords
that once came easily He’s sweaty twitchy Even if we
have no idea that Charlie’s GOING COLD TURKEY -- we quickly
realize that this guy is barely keeping it together

LOCKE (0S)
Charlie--

Charlie squints down towards the mouth of the cave and sees
LOCKE silhouetted by the early morning light

LOCKE (cont’d)
How about you and I go for a walk

CHARLIE
Uh N-no thanks Locke Think I’11
stay in today

He goes back to his guitar but stops when he sees Locke
moving closer looking hard at him -

LOCKE
C’mon The fresh air will do you
good

Not exactly a question anymore ON CHARLIE - After a moment
he nods puts down his guitar and rises to join him

EXT BEACH - BY THE INFIRMARY TENT - MEANWHILE 2

CLOSE ON KATE’S MUGSHOT WIDEN to reveal it’s being held by
JACK standing over a leather bag full of medical supplies
He’s TOTALLY FOCUSED on the photo in his hand staring at it
wistfully when he hears

KATE (0S)
I take better pictures than that

Jack spins to face -- KATE smiling unsurely Happy to see
Jack despite what he’s holding Trying to make light of it --
(CONTD)

KATE (cont’d)
Smaller too I mean if you’d
like something for your wallet
He looks at her a beat almost sadly

JACK
Just came to pick up a few things

He hands Kate her mug shot The ROAD BLOCK between them

JACK (contd)
This uh It was with my stuff

Kate takes the photo folds it up -- MEMORIES HERE Jack
goes back to packing up his things

KATE
So You’re not staying

JACK
Hurley and I We’ve been checking
out in the valley
(pointedly)
And they’re a hell of a lot safer
than living out here on the beach

KATE
You’re mad at me

He stops packing to look at her

JACK
No Kate I’m-- I just don’t
understand why you won’t come with
me -- us The caves are--

KATE
We crashed eight days ago I’m not
setting up house here Jack

JACK
Look I want off this island too
But we both know that’s not gonna
happen anytime soon

They stand in silence for a beat then

KATE
Sayid He has a plan

(CONTD) 2

JACK
To find the source of the distress
signal Yeah I remember

KATE
The transmission’s coming from
somewhere on the island If we can
find it --

JACK
-- That signal’s been playing on a
loop for sixteen years The woman
who left it wasn’t rescued what
makes you think it’1ll be different
for us

KATE
(after a beat)
Because I believe it

Jack eyes her a moment

JACK
I wish I shared your faith

SAWYER (0S)
Wouldn’t mind sharing a few things
with her myself

They both turn to see SAWYER strolling up a bag slung over
his shoulder There’s no love lost between him and Jack

KATE
What do you want Sawyer

SAWYER
Not a thing sweetheart Heard the
doc here was vacating the premises
Thought I’d best lay claim to my
new digs before somebody else does

He tosses his bag into the tent Jack can’t fucking believe
this guy --

JACK
I didn’t build this for you to live
in -- it’s an infirmary

SAWYER
Not without a doctor around it
ain’t Yep I could fix this place
up real nice

(MORE)
(CONTD) 2
SAWYER (contd)
(turning his gaze to Kate)
Maybe even find someone to share it
with me

Kate rolls her eyes digusted Jack doesn’t have time for

this High School shit -- Hoists the leather bag
JACK
Fine Take the tent
KATE
Jack
JACK

I’1ll see you later
And Jack goes Sawyer comes up behind her

SAWYER
Offer on the tent stands Freckles
Think about it

Kate throws him a glare moves off Sawyer smirks as he
calls after her

SAWYER (cont’d)
C’mon -- You don’t wanna be out
there all alone do ya

EXT JUNGLE - CLEARING - MEANWHILE 3

WIDE ON CHARLIE alone inexplicably standing in the middle
of a clearing surrounded by tall dense brush

CUT IN CLOSE on his face - Looking pale breathing shallowly
His eyes dart around anxiously When suddenly he hears A
TWIG SNAP His head SWINGS toward the direction Whispers --

CHARLIE
Locke Th-that you

The SNAPPING becomes QUICKER the nearby brush shakes and we
hear an UNGODLY SCREECH Something’s charging --

AND CHARLIE RUNS FOR HIS LIFE TRACK WITH him as he crashes
through the flora weaving among the tall trees -- TIGHT ON
HIS FACE terror in his eyes when we hear

CHARLIE (PRE-LAP) (cont’d)
Bless me Father for I have
sinned
INT CHURCH - CONFESSIONAL BOOTH - DAY - FLASHBACK 4
Someone kneeling head bowed penitent before a priest --

CHARLIE
It’s been a week since my last
confession

He lifts his head and we recognize that this CLEAN-CUT GUY IN
TAILORED CLOTHES is CHARLIE five years younger GONE is the
nail polish the grungy clothes He hesitates

PRIEST
Go ahead my son

CHARLIE
Last night I had physical
relations with a girl I I

didn’t even know

PRIEST
I see Anything else
CHARLIE
Yeah Then uh right after that
I had y’know relations with
another girl
PRIEST
Two girls Well that’s--
CHARLIE
And then I watched while they
had relations with each other

SILENCE And we can read on Charlie’s face that this ISN’T a

joke -- that he is TRULY CONFLICTED At war with himself
PRIEST
I uh You Hmmm
CHARLIE
See it’s my band Father Drive
Shaft We’ve been playing this
club in Manchester and well
we’re starting to get some real
heat A following like And
these girls they well

There’s some serious temptations
that come with the territory If
you know what I mean
(CONTD) 4

PRIEST

Yes well We all have our
temptations but giving in to them
that’s your choice I know it’s
difficult but find strength in
your faith Your family

(anxious to be done)
Say five Our Fathers and two Hail
Marys and you will be absolved

The slot SLIDES SHUT OFF Charlie crossing himself a
little taken aback by the abruptness --

INT CHURCH - A MOMENT LATER - FLASHBACK 5
As Charlie emerges from the confessional

IAN (0S)
And the meek shall inherit the
earth

Charlie glances up to see in a pew by the aisle

IAN a “MUIC LUT” T-shirt and ripped jeans (His look
should say OASIS THE VERVE -- NOT HEAVY METAL) A few years
older than Charlie he’s a guy you can’t take your eyes off
Good-looking charismatic His motorcycle boots draped over
the pew in front of him

CHARLIE
(mortified sotto)
Ian -- You’re in a church Get
your sodden boots off there

Ian does so as Charlie wipes the pew with his jacket sleeve
IAN
Relax Choir Boy I bring tidings
of great joy
He flashes a smile as he holds up a BUSINESS LETTER --
IAN (contd)
We’ve just been signed to a
recording contract You’re gonna

be a rock god

And as the news LANDS ON Charlie we BLAST BACK OUT TO --
EXT JUNGLE - MORNING 6

CHARLIE -- as he continues to TEAR ASS through the jungle
WHIPPING PAST TREES -- HURDLING BUSHES -- until he reaches --

A DEAD END He spins around in time to see --

A SQUEALING FLASH OF FUR BURSTS THROUGH THE BRUSH

ON CHARLIE - Breathing hard pinching his eyes closed as the
thing bares down on him then

CLOSE ON A ROPE draped across a tree branch PULLING TAUT and

WE SEE A SCREECHING BOAR -- ASCENDING INTO THE SKY --
SQUEALING AND CONVULSING IN A NET

LOCKE (0S)
Nicely done Charlie

Charlie looks over at
LOCKE -- securing the pull-rope attached to the BOAR TRAP

LOCKE (contd)
You make excellent bait

ON CHARLIE taking a step toward him as all shades of that
good kid in the confessional melt away and a DARKNESS falls
over his eyes He speaks in a harsh dangerous whisper

CHARLIE
(glad I could oblige)
Now give me my bloody drugs

And off a glowering CHARLIE --

CUT TO BLACK

END OF TEASER

ACT ONE

EXT JUNGLE - CONTINUOUS 7

ON fuming Charlie trailing Locke ON THE MOVE calmly
receiving Charlie’s verbal assault

CHARLIE
You hear what I said I want my
drugs back I need them

LOCKE
Yet you gave them to me Hmmm

CHARLIE
And bloody well regret it I’m
sick man Can’t you see that

LOCKE
I think you’re a lot stronger than
you know Charlie And I’m gonna
prove it to you

Locke comes to a nearby backpack resting on a rock and from
a side pocket removes a HUGE HUNTING KNIFE ON CHARLIE --
seeing the knife -- What’s Locke got in mind here

LOCKE (cont’d)
I’1ll let you ask me for your drugs
three times And the third
time I’m going to give them to
you Now Just so were clear
(gesturing with knife)
This was one

As Charlie takes that in Locke crosses to the netted boar

CHARLIE
Why-- Why are you doing this To
torture me Just throw them away --
Get rid of ‘em and be done with it

LOCKE
If I did that you wouldn’t have a
choice Charlie

CHARLIE reacts remembering the words of his priest as LOCKE
grabs the netting surrounding the squealing boar

LOCKE (cont’d)
Having a choice making decisions
based more than instinct
(indicates the boar)
(MORE)
(CONTD) 7
LOCKE (cont’d)
is the only thing that separates
you from him

With that Locke (OFF-CAMERA) stabs the boar in the throat

AND ON CHARLIE as he adverts his eyes the Boar letting out
an AGUISHED SQUEAL

EXT BEACH - DAY 8

BOOMING DOWN on a MAKESHIFT ANTENNA reminiscent of the one
in Ep 2 and attached to an 8-foot pole from the wreckage
until we find

SAYID securing the pole into the wet sand and addressing
BOONE and KATE who stand nearby a duffle bag at their feet

SAYID
Three antennas Three points of a
triangle One here on the beach

He removes another antenna from the bag and hands it to Kate

SAYID (contd)
Another Kate will position in the
jungle roughly two kilometers in
And the third

He brings up yet another antenna this one hardwired to the
ever-important TRANSCEIVER

SAYID (contd)

I’1l take to high ground

(points toward mountains)
--up there If the French
transmission is coming from
somewhere within our triangulation
Ill be able to locate the source

(beat)
But there are two complications

BOONE
Of course there are

SAYID
The power cells I’ve grafted onto
the antennas are drained There’s
no telling how long they’1l last
A minute Maybe more Maybe less
(CONTD)

KATE
(understanding)
So we all have to be in position
before we switch them on

BOONE
Whoa wait a minute how are we
supposed to do that There’s no
way to communicate with each other

Sayid just SMILES Thought of this Reaches into his
duffel pulls out THREE BOTTLE ROCKETS

KATE
Bottle rockets

SAYID

God bless firework smugglers

(then slowly and clearly)
When I’m in position Ill fire off
my rocket When you two see it
fire yours After the last one
goes up we’ll all switch on our
antennas

KATE
You said there were two
complications

SAYID

The battery in the transceiver is
dead And I’ve yet to find a
suitable replacement Without the
transceiver all of this is for
nothing

(beat)
Something from a PDA or better
yet a laptop computer would

probably work but I’ve been
unable to salvage any from the
wreckage

Kate thinks for a moment glances back at the beach camp

KATE
Think I might know where to look

OFF KATE hoping this will work

i

INT THE VALLEY - WATER POOL - DAY 9

ON CHARLIE - or rather HIS REFLECTION in the pool as he
stares at his pale haggard face His hands suddenly dive
in obliterating his reflected image

NEW ANGLE as Charlie sits at the pool’s edge splashes water
on his face In Korean

JIN (0S)
Hey You

Charlie squints up to see JIN looking down on him from the
nook on which he and Sun have settled SUN stops laying out
their belongings to observe her husband shouting at Charlie

JIN (contd)
That water is for drinking

ON CHARLIE he waves no idea what Jin’s saying

CHARLIE
Morning

JIN disgusted shakes his head and returns to his wife As
Charlie shakily gets to his feet he hears

HURLEY (0S)
Jack Dude What’s in these
things -- cinder blocks

ON HURLEY entering the caves struggling to carry two large
suitcases With him is JACK the leather bag over his
shoulder cradling another suitcase lying flat in his arms

JACK
Packed anything I thought’d be
useful here without leaving the
others empty-handed

Exhausted Hurley puts his suitcases down as CHARLIE crosses
over to them

CHARLIE
Hey Need a hand

JACK
No thanks I think we’re good

CHARLIE
I don’t mind Used to lug around
my band’s equipment back in the

(CONTD) 9

CHARLIE (cont’d)
day Before we had roadies
(re Jack’s suitcases)
Here lemme get that --

JACK
Charlie No The zipper’s--

Charlie grabs the handle of the suitcase and takes it from
Jack -- but as he does the lid FLOPS OPEN and the contents
spill out onto the ground

JACK (contd)

broken
CHARLIE
Aw hell Sorry I was just
trying to--
JACK
Help I know It’s okay
(to Hurley)

Hurley why don’t we grab those
last couple of bags

HURLEY
(unthrilled)
Oh could we

As Jack and Hurley move away Jack drops the leather shoulder
bag on the ground near Charlie who continues retrieving the
fallen items until he catches sight of

HIS POV - THE LEATHER BAG open and piled on top are
numerous PRESCRIPTION BOTTLES

ON CHARLIE frozen for a moment as his mind reels He looks
in the direction Jack and Hurley headed then back behind
him Satisfied the coast is clear he moves to the leather
bag and rummages through it checking the labels as he goes
He brings up a bottle and evidently likes what he reads when

JACK (0S)
What are you doing

Charlie finds Jack standing over him
CHARLIE
Oh Um I’ve got a bit of a
headache So I thought

Jack takes the bottle from Charlie and checks the label

ee
(CONTD) JACK
Valium

CHARLIE
Couldnt find any aspirin

Jack tosses the bottle back into the bag and zips it closed

JACK
It’s not self-serve Charlie This
medicine may have to last us
awhile Gotta save it for things
more serious than a headache

CHARLIE
Yeah Yeah You’re right

And now Jack notices Charlie’s SHAKY STATE for the first
time Steps closer to him

JACK
You okay You’re looking a little--

Charlie turns away not wanting Jack to examine him and
back to picking up the fallen contents

CHARLIE
Told you Just a headache

JACK
Leave it Get some water Maybe
youre dehydrated

CHARLIE
(continuing the clean-up)
Just want to be useful --

Jack squats next to Charlie and grabs his arm

JACK
(firmly)
Charlie I got it We don’t need
you right now Go take care of
yourself man

Charlie looks at Jack stung as Jack takes over Charli
stands up feeling dismissed like a child as he watches
Jack clean up his mess And as we go TIGHT ON CHARLIE

IAN (PRE-LAP)
C’mon Charlie-boy We can’t do
this without you

goes

INT CHURCH - DAY - FLASHBACK

We’re on Charlie moments after we left him sitting in the

front pew head in hands holding the business letter

sitting on the altar now addressing him

IAN
Face it You’re the heart and
soul of the band You are bloody
Drive Shaft

CHARLIE
Watch the language

IAN
(hopping off the altar)
Sod that This is our shot at the
big-time What’s the problem

CHARLIE
I dunno I just
(standing)

I want to keep things the way they
are Playing the pubs It’s
enough for me

He heads down the aisle Ian at his heels

IAN
Yeah fine for you You’re the
smart one Be anything you want
It’s your songs that got us signed
I’m just the clown with the pretty
face that sings ‘em Now you wanna
take away my chance to be somebody

They stop near the back of the sanctuary by a CISTERN

with holy water as Charlie turns back to him

CHARLIE
Ian it’s not about you It’s
(difficult to admit)
Look I love the band but It’s
not who I am
(beat)
Sometimes I get lost in it

Tans

filled

Ian looks at him a moment registering Charlie’s concern

(CONTD) 10

IAN
Won’t happen ‘Cause we’ll be
there looking out for each other
What brothers do right

As Charlie considers this Ian splashes him with holy water
from the cistern

CHARLIE
Ian --
(getting splashed again)
Stop that you lunatic

IAN
Now you sound like Mum

Charlie can’t help but smile at that After a moment
CHARLIE
Just promise me If things get
too crazy No matter what If I
say we’re done We walk away

IAN
We walk away

CHARLIE
You swear it

IAN
(pledging)
Youre the rock god baby brother
OFF CHARLIE as he nods sealing their pact
INT INFIRMARY TENT —- DAY 11
CLOSE ON KATE an ICY expression on her face

KATE
Why don’t I believe you

WIDEN to see she’s addressing a lounging SAWYER his battered

copy of “WATERSHIP DOWN” on his lap

SAWYER
Couldn’t say cupcake Most folks
think I got a trustworthy face Or
so they tell me

1 (CONTD) 11

KATE
Youve been hoarding like a packrat
since the crash and you don’t have
a single laptop

Sawyer studies Kate Smiles

SAWYER
We are testy aren’t we Still
upset about your little breakup

KATE

SAWYER
Musta hurt bad when Doc came back
for his record collection
(just plain mean)
Cause now there’s nothing for him
to come back for

And Kate just looks at him Then speaks to him evenly --

KATE
God it must be so exhausting

SAWYER
What’s that

KATE
Living like a parasite Always
talking never giving

SAWYER
Boy you sure got me pegged

KATE
I get it now It all makes sense
You don’t want to get off this
island because there’s nothing for
you to go back to There’s no one
you miss And no one misses you

SAWYER
Awww Feelin’ sorry for me How
sweet

KATE

I don’t feel sorry for you
(simple true)
I pity you

(CONTD) 11

Sawyer just sits there for a MOMENT Then he reaches into
his bag again and brings out a LAPTOP He slides the BATTERY
out TOSSES it to her --

SAWYER
All you had to do was say please

Kate stares at him a beat then turns and goes ON SAWYER
watching her his glib smirk melting away for just a second
showing he might just’ve been STUNG

INT THE VALLEY - CHARLIE’S CAVE - DAY 12
CHARLIE sitting against a wall Jonesing and a bit hyper

HURLEY (0S)
Hey Dude This yours

Charlie sees Hurley standing over him holding his guitar
Charlie’s pleased to have some engagement anxious to talk

CHARLIE
Yeah Probably wondering ‘cause
I’m known for playing bass in Drive
Shaft S’only ‘cause we could
never find a decent bass player
(getting to his feet)
Wrote a bunch of songs with that
guitar “You All Everybody”
That was mine Got the idea from --

HURLEY
Listen man Jack just wants you to
find another place for this thing
He’s moving supplies and says it’s
in the way

He hands him the guitar and walks out PUSH IN ON CHARLIE
feeling foolish Then eyes narrowing in anger he moves off
frame

INT THE VALLEY - LARGE CAVE - MOMENTS LATER 13

ON JACK scrutinizing a naturally formed pillar near the
center of the cave He places his hand against it and with
that a small stream of dirt and pebbles cascades down the
side of the pillar As Jack takes that in he hears

CHARLIE (0S)
You know most people look up to
me Respect me --

(CONTD) 13

Jack turns to find Charlie converging on him

JACK CHARLIE

Charlie -- -- And you treat me like a
bloody child like some
useless joke --

-- What are you talking --
-- I’m not good enough to
help Right No No I’m
just in the way --

Jack can see that Charlie is PALE SWEATING -- in a bad
fucking way Concerned --

JACK
You okay man C’mon sit down
Let me take a look at you --

CHARLIE JACK
-- Right You’1ll look out
for me We look out for each
other Well stuff that -- -- Charlie calm down
Youre not yourself --

CHARLIE
You don’t know me I’m a bloody
rock god
INT THE VALLEY - WATER POOL - DAY 14

PANNING OFF HURLEY filling up his water bottle we find

JIN by the pool’s edge sporting the detached handcuff
bracelet dabbing the raw skin around it with a rag SUN
comes over wearing a low-cut tank top and kneels beside

him Jin doesn’t look up at her The following’s subtitled

SUN
You should have the doctor look at
your wrist

JIN
Its fine It will heal --

As he looks up at her he sees her attire for the first time

JIN (contd)
What are you wearing Its
indecent Cover yourself

Sun leans back and eyes him squarely

(CONTD) 14

SUN
Its too hot

Before Jin stunned at her defiance can respond they both
react to a DISTANT RUMBLE and notice

The water in the pool RIPPLING

AND GRRRRRBOOOOOM The RUMBLE GROWS LOUDER and the Earth
shakes PUSH IN on HURLEY as he sees it first

HURLEY
Aw no

ANGLE ON CAVE ENTRANCE - A THICK CLOUD OF DUST bursting from
it HANDHELD -- CHOATIC --

Hurley Jin and Sun hurry over -- DUST SWIRLING EVERYWHERE as
they find CHARLIE choking and coughing on the ground by
what used to be the cave entrance now sealed by rock and

earth

HURLEY (contd)
Charlie Where’s Jack
(no answer)
WHERES JACK

A coughing Charlie lifts his arm AND POINTS AT THE CAVE-IN
And OFF HURLEY’S look of dread

CUT TO BLACK

END OF ACT ONE

ACT TWO
15 INT THE VALLEY - CAVE ENTRANCE - DAY 15
ON CHARLIE where we left him SHELL-SHOCKED As we hear

HURLEY (0S)
JACK --

CUT WIDE to see HURLEY standing at the SEALED CAVE ENTRANCE
Jin and Sun are there too Already pulling away rocks
speaking urgently to each other in Korean

HURLEY (contd)
JACK -- CAN YOU HEAR ME

CHARLIE
(dazed)

I-- I dunno what happened We were

talking and it all just It
just came down on top of us

HURLEY CHARLIE
(to Charlie)
Dude we gotta get help -- Happened so fast

Hurley grabs Charlie and pulls him to his feet

HURLEY
Charlie You gotta run to the
beach and get help Now

CHARLIE
(grasping his mission)
Right On it

He runs off Stay with Hurley as he calls after him --

HURLEY
Make sure you tell Kate
16 EXT JUNGLE - DAY 16
KATE and SAYID -- NOT at the beach -- as they trek through

DENSE JUNGLE Sayid’s antennas PROMINENT in their backpacks
SUDDENLY KATE JUST STOPS SPOOKED Sayid looks at her

SAYID
What is it

(CONTD)

KATE
I dunno Felt like a goose just
walked over my grave
(off Sayid’s look)
Something my dad used to say When
he got the feeling something bad
just happened You ever get that

SAYID
Only about every thirty seconds

Kate manages a smile as Sayid continues on and she follows

KATE
What we’re doing I mean chasing
some phantom distress signal --
What are the odds of this working

SAYID
No worse than the odds of us
surviving that plane crash

KATE
People survive plane crashes all
the time

SAYID

Not like this one The tail
section broke off when we were
still in the air The cockpit
separated some time later Our
section cart-wheeled through the
jungle completely crushing those
who died And yet we escaped with
nothing more than a few scrapes
How do you explain that

KATE
(considers then shrugs)
Blind dumb luck

SAYID
No one is that lucky We shouldn’t
have survived

KATE
(half-playful)
So what -- We’re dead And
this is what Hell

Sayid gives her a bemused look --

(CONTD) 16
SAYID
Of course not That’s insane
All I’m saying is that perhaps
there’s a reason we’re still alive
KATE

Divine intervention

(off his non-response)
Sorry Sayid but things just
happen No rhyme or reason to it

SAYID
(grins)
Tell that to your goose

AND OFF KATE as they forge deeper into the unknown
EXT BEACH - DAY 17

CHARLIE reaches the beach -- out of breath -- rushes up to
MICHAEL and WALT - Michael’s shaving as Walt pets VINCENT
lying next to him

CHARLIE
HEY We need help

MICHAEL
What’s wrong man

CHARLIE
It’s Jack He’s trapped There
was a cave-in

SHANNON and Boone overhear and rush over --

BOONE CHARLIE
What How -- -- Cave collapsed Don’t
even know if he’s alive We
gotta get him out

MICHAEL looks around spots a couple of burly SURVIVORS Good-
looking guys in their FORTIES He calls out to one of them

MICHAEL
Hey you Scott

STEVE
I’m Steve
(pointing to his partner)
He’s Scott

(CONTD) 17

MICHAEL
We got an emergency Grab a couple
more guys and c’mon --

CHARLIE
Yeah We gotta move Follow me

Charlie starts to lead them toward the jungle Walt and
Vincent tag along Suddenly Boone STOPS Shit PULLS the
BOTTLE ROCKET from his pocket turns to Shannon --

BOONE
Shannon you need to do something
important okay
(points to the ANTENNA)
At five o’clock you need to be
ready to turn that thing on The
switch is right at the base

SHANNON
Uh why

BOONE

Kate and Sayid are triangulating
the French signal But the
antenna’s power is weak so you
have to wait until they fire off
their bottle rockets

(holds up his rocket)

Then you fire off this one Then
turn on the antenna Got it

A long beat She just looks at him BLANKLY Then --

SHANNON
The switch is where now

BOONE
Did you hear a word I said

SHANNON
Look don’t get mad at me because
the Professor and Maryann have a
confusing frigging plan

BOONE
Can you do it or can’t you

Shannon shakes her head but petulantly takes the ROCKET --

(CONTD) 17

SHANNON BOONE
Yeah I can do it
-- If you can’t

SHANNON
Ican Go save the world already

Boone nods Runs off to join the others all heading into
the jungle We pick up CHARLIE who stops abruptly --
doubles back -- realizing someone’s missing --

CHARLIE
Wait Kate I gotta let Kate know
about Jack

SAWYER (0S)
Sorry sport you just missed
her

ON SAWYER by the infirmary tent having heard everything
wringing out his wet T-shirt

SAWYER (contd)
She and Muhammed headed into the
woods ‘bout ten minutes ago --

CHARLIE
Which way

SAWYER
Don’t sweat it amigo I know
which way they went

Charlie starts to protest but Sawyer cuts him off --

SAWYER (contd)
I‘ll tell her You just keep
doing whatever it is you do
around here

Sawyer hurries off in another direction of the jungle
leaving Charlie standing there ignored and alone PUSHING
IN ON HIS FACE we hear a BASS LINE playing accompanied by
the roar of an appreciative crowd

INT CONCERT VENUE - NIGHT - FLASHBACK 18

CHARLIE ON STAGE before a microphone stand fingering a bass

intro He appears more like the Charlie we know Grunge
attire earring etc

ee

(CONTD) 18

CUT TO A REVERSE behind Charlie and we see (via the magic of
GREEN SCREEN) a huge filled concert arena complete with
screaming fans And when we REVERSE again

WE SEE the whole four-piece band of DRIVE SHAFT guitarist
drummer and IAN front and center with his own mic stand
head banging through the intro

CLOSE ON CHARLIE again as he steps up to the mic and opens
his mouth to launch into a verse when

IAN (SINGING)
YOU ALL EVERYBODY ACTIN’ LIKE ITS
THE STUPID PEOPLE

Charlie snaps a look over at Ian who wails away --

IAN (SINGING) (cont’d)
WEARIN THE ‘SPENSIVE CLOTHES
AND THEY NOT

A clearly perturbed Charlie joins in on the chorus

IANCHARLIE (SINGING)
YOU ALL EVERYBODY YOU ALL

UPCUT TO
INT CONCERT VENUE - DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT - FLASHBACK 19
ON A CLOSED DOOR We hear APPLAUSE and WHOOPING coming from
the other side as the door bursts open IAN enters
followed by CHARLIE and the rest of the band In the hall
behind them we see SCREAMING FANS T-SHIRTED SECURITY GUARDS

WIDEN as RECORD-EXEC TYPES and their assorted eye-candy dates
move in to congratulate them

RECORD EXEC
Killer Ian Just killer

Before Ian responds Charlie grabs his arm pulls him aside

CHARLIE
What the hell was that out there

IAN
Uh Another kick-ass show You
were bloody brilliant

(CONTD) 19

CHARLIE
I sing the intro to “You All
Everybody”

IAN
(laughing)
Oh yeah Sorry about that man
Justgot caught up in the moment
Like the crowd wanted it y’know
Won’t happen again I swear

GROUPIE (0S)
Tan

Ian turns and see a lovely GROUPIE being blocked by the
security guards He waves her in calls out

IAN
She’s cool Let her in

Ian moves to greet her as Charlie watches him go A RECORD
EXEC comes over with two flutes of champagne

RECORD EXEC
Have some champagne Chuck You
deserve it

But Charlie is focused on something else HIS POV - The
GROUPIE slips IAN a couple of 35mm film canisters You know
the type -- the short black plastic tubes with gray pop-off
tops Ian kisses the girl then notices

CHARLIE staring at him a disapproving look on his face
IAN
(to Charlie)
Chill baby brother

He pops open a cannister and pulls out a baggy of powder --
the same type we’ve seen Charlie snort on the island

IAN (contd)
Rock gods gotta fly

And OFF CHARLIE betrayed and alone WE FIND --

INT THE VALLEY - CAVE ENTRANCE - DAY 20

HURLEY - filthy and exhausted continuing to remove rocks and
dirt from the mountain of rubble sealing the entrance WIDEN
to see SUN and JIN doing the same Hurley strains to remove
a particularly large rock until he hears

(CONTD) 20

MICHAEL (0OS)
Stop

MICHAEL BOONE WALT and the FOUR SOCKS (including Scott and
Steve) enter the valley Walt checks out the mess

HURLEY
What do you mean “stop” dude
Jack’s in there --

MICHAEL
And if you remove that rock you
might bring the whole cave ceiling
down on top of him
(re Walt under his feet)

Walt get back man I don’t want
you near the rocks okay And take
the dog with you --

WALT MICHAEL
Why do I have to --
-- Just do it

Walt sulks while he pulls Vincent to the stream for a drink

but hangs back and watches as Michael studies the collapse

MICHAEL (contd)
This area over here is load
bearing We gotta dig where
there’s no danger of the wall
buckling in on itself

BOONE
How do you know so much about --

MICHAEL
Eight years of construction work

Michael reaches the left side of the obstruction --

MICHAEL (contd)
Here We dig here Four ata
time By hand until we can
fashion some kinda shovel We take
shifts and go slow --

ON WALT as Michael continues giving out orders A leader
A side of Michael Walt’s never seen

MICHAEL (contd)
Whoever isn’t digging should be
clearing the rocks we pull out

ee

(CONTD) 20
MICHAEL (contd)
bringing water to who’s working
Okay lLet’s move
EXT JUNGLE - DAY 21
KATE continues to trek through the jungle with Sayid -- when
they hear a rustle in the underbrush -- STOP -- NERVOUS --
SAYID
Something’s coming --
SAWYER emerges from the jungle Kate shakes her head --
KATE
What the hell are you doing here
SAWYER
(winded)
Easy I just came to tell you
something --
KATE
(harsh tone)
What makes you think I’m interested
in anything you have to say to me

SAWYER taken aback by this reception After a beat

SAWYER
Came to tell you You were right
(off her look)
About me That I don’t help anyone
but myself Well here I am

Ready to pitch in

Are Sayid and Kate skeptical Fuck yeah

KATE
Youre here to help
SAWYER
Hey -- You act any more surprised

I’m gonna be insulted

And OFF KATE wondering what Sawyer’s up to -- no idea that
he’s sitting on the news of the cave-in -- WE FIND --

EXT JUNGLE - DAY 22

CHARLIE his withdrawal symptoms worsening heading through
the jungle to the place where Locke trapped the boar --

(CONTD) 22

LOCKE (0S)
Something wrong Charlie

Charlie whips around to see LOCKE the skinned BOAR in the
background hanging from a tree by its heels

CHARLIE
Yeah Jack He’s There’s been
an accident At the caves
Jack’s buried in a cave-in

Locke takes that in wiping his bloody knife on his shirt

LOCKE

Is anyone trying to get him out
CHARLIE

Yeah -- Bunch of people there now
LOCKE

And why aren’t you with them
(no response)

You didn’t come to tell me about

Jack did you

Charlie looks at the ground broken

CHARLIE
I want my stash Locke I can’t
stand feeling like this

Locke eyes him a moment then nods

LOCKE
Let me show you something

He leads Charlie to a tree points out a COCOON on its trunk

LOCKE (cont’d)
What do you suppose is in this
cocoon Charlie

CHARLIE
(not in the mood)
I dunno Butterfly I guess

LOCKE
No It’s much more beautiful than
that This is a moth cocoon
(smiles then)
Ironic Butterflies get all the
(MORE)

(CONTD) 22
LOCKE (contd)
attention But moths They spin
silk They’re stronger Faster

CHARLIE
Yeah Wonderful What’s the --

But Locke ignores him leaning in CLOSE to the cocoon
Transfixed -- in his own world to some degree

LOCKE
See this tiny hole This moth’s
almost ready to emerge It’s in
there right now struggling
digging its way through the thick
hide of the cocoon Now I could
help it take my knife gently
widen the opening And the moth
would be free But it’d be too
weak to survive

(looks at Charlie)

The struggle is nature’s way of
strengthening it

He pulls the baggie out of his pocket
LOCKE (cont’d)

This is the second time youve
asked me for your drugs back

He holds the baggie out holds it right up to Charlie’s face

And we’re CLOSE ON LOCKE as his eyes narrow

LOCKE (cont’d)
Ask me again and it’s yours

And OFF CHARLIE hungering for a fix

CUT TO BLACK

END OF ACT TWO

ACT THREE

EXT JUNGLE - DAY 23

CLOSE ON CHARLIE stumbling along a jungle path Dazed
Leaving us to assume he’s had a fix THE CAMERA FLOATS with
him dreamily emulating his high or so it’d seem

But something is WEIRD HERE Something is DEFINITELY OFF
And then Charlie just STOPS -- because up ahead is --

A MAN SITTING ON A ROCK Just sitting there wearing a black
t-shirt his back to Charlie

CHARLIE
Hello

As Charlie inches forward -- the guy suddenly turns around
And HOLY FUCKING SHIT It’s

CHARLIE (cont’d)
J-Jack

JACK
Where’d you do Charlie

CHARLIE
Wha-- Nowhere I mean I went for
help For you But I was I
I got lost
(notices Jack’s shirt)
What are you wearing

As Jack looks down we TILT DOWN to see he’s wearing Ian’s
“MUIC LUT” T-shirt

JACK
You’ve seen me in this before
Choir Boy
(stands intense)
You were supposed to look out for
me Charlie But you left me to
die in a hole

Scared and confused Charlie backs away --
CHARLIE
How’d you get out of the cave

Jack

And now Jack is COMING TOWARDS HIM eyes burning --

(CONTD) 23

JACK
Don’t you get it rock god I’M
STILL THERE
(singing a capella)
YOU ALL EVERYBODY YOU ALL

EVERYBODY --
And as he’s almost ON TOP of Charlie a BIRD’S CA-CAWS
RATTLE CHARLIE He jolts -- as if waking from a dream And
when he looks back -- Jack is gone As Charlie moves off
unnerved
OMITTED 24
INT THE VALLEY - JACK’S CAVE - DAY 25
BLACKNESS AS WE PAN ACROSS IT we hear SCRAPING NOISES
THE CAMERA finally comes to rest on the still face of --
JACK unconscious His battered body WEDGED between the far
wall of the space and a HUGE REMNANT of the collapsed PILLAR
The scraping sound gets louder then suddenly -- a long HOE-

LIKE PIECE OF FUSELAGE pushes through displacing some rocks
and revealing a hole through which light streams in From
the other side we can barely make out --

HURLEY (0S)
We’re through We got a hole
(shouting)
Jack Can you hear me JACK

The sound of Hurley’s voice causes Jack to stir rousing him
to consciousness His eyes flutter open -- trying to make
sense of the dark space and the VISE-LIKE GRIP on him --

HURLEY (0S) (cont’d)
C’mon Dude Answer me --

JACK
H-Hurley

HURLEY (0S)
(faintly to others)
I hear him

A cheer of relief ECHOES into the cave from the outside

HURLEY (contd)
Jack Bro you okay
25 (CONTD) 25

Jack tries to move BUT HE CAN’T Every attempt to do so is
met with EXCRUCIATING PAIN Even talking is difficult --

JACK
I’m I’m pinned I can’t move
(suddenly remembers)
Charlie Charlie was with me --

HURLEY (0S)
He’s okay man He made it out
Listen we’re gonna get you out of
there Just sit tight

And as the irony of that registers on Jack’s face WE FIND --
26 EXT JUNGLE - ANTENNA POSITION TWO - DAY 26

KATE completely oblivious to Jack’s predicament as she
Sayid and Sawyer enter a clearing

SAYID
This is far enough We’ll place
the second antenna here

Kate removes her antenna from her backpack Sayid takes out
a small coil of wire looks around then at Sawyer

SAYID (contd)
You want to help
(pointing)
Attach this antenna up in that
tree As high as you can

SAWYER
Golly thanks

He takes the antenna from Kate giving her a wink and moves
toward the tree Sayid hands Kate her bottle rocket

SAYID
Five o’clock Watch for my flare
Then it’s your turn

Kate nods Sayid glances over at Sawyer uncoiling the wire

SAYID (contd)
I do not trust him

KATE
Who does

(CONTD) 26

SAYID
(more pointedly)
I do not trust him with you
Kate looks at Sayid Then smiles at him fondly

KATE
I can handle him

Sayid doesn’t like it but he NODS Heads back off into
the jungle ON KATE as she turns to watch Sawyer --

INT THE VALLEY - CAVE ENTRANCE - DAY 27

ON MICHAEL addressing the others before a hole roughly the

diameter of a TIRE -- the ENTRANCE of their makeshift TUNNEL

MICHAEL
Okay We can’t safely make the
tunnel any bigger But since Jack
can’t get out One of us is gonna
have to go in

HURLEY
What Crawl through that

BOONE
I think he means someone smaller

Sun steps forward (others are around NO SUBTITLES) --

SUN JIN
I could climb through -- -- I forbid it
(to others)
I will not permit you to use

my wife for such a dangerous--

HURLEY
Dude We don’t understand Chinese

MICHAEL
Korean man They’re Korean

He and Sun share a fleeting look unnoticed by Jin

CHARLIE (0S)
Ill do it

They all turn to see -- CHARLIE standing behind them And
he looks like hell -- but with something that resembles
COURAGE weather he got it from the drugs or not

(CONTD)

HURLEY
Charlie

MICHAEL
No man You’re still shook up I
might be able to squeeze through --

CHARLIE
Yeah Who’s gonna look after your
kid if something happens
(to Boone)
And youve got your sister
(re Sun)
She’s got a husband
(beat without self-pity)
I got no one No family I’m
alone here
(then to Michael)
And I’m small Let me do this

As Michael looks at him consider his offer

EXT JUNGLE - ANTENNA POSITION TWO - DAY 28

SAWYER sitting in the shade of a tree watching Kate as she
scans the horizon checking her watch constantly

SAWYER
Still ain’t five Just like the
last time you checked your watch

KATE
I just don’t want to miss Sayid’s
signal Remember I’1l fire the
flare you switch on the antenna

SAWYER
Thank the good Lord I got you here
to keep reminding me

Kate shoots him a look then focuses back on the horizon

After a beat

SAWYER (cont’d)
So what do you see in that guy
anyway
(off her look)
Jack What is it about him that
makes you go all weak in the loins

i
28 (CONTD) 28

KATE
Do you try to be a pig or does it
just come naturally

SAWYER
It’s that he’s a doctor right
Ladies always dig the doctors
Hell -- Give me a couple band-aids
bottle of Peroxide and I could run
this island too --

KATE
You’re actually comparing yourself
to Jack

SAWYER

Difference between us ain’t all
that big sweetheart I guarantee
if he’d survived a few more weeks
on the island you’d have figured
it out --

KATE
What did you just say

Sawyer looks at her unsure what she means

KATE (cont’d)
You said ‘if he’d survived a few
more weeks’ What does that --

Sawyer realizes he’s BUSTED He manages a smirk --

SAWYER
Aw damn Didn’t I tell you
Word from the valley is Saint Jack
got himself buried in a cave-in

KATE
What

SAWYER
Hey look at the bright side
(brutal)
Now you got someone else to pity

Shit The man holds a GRUDGE Kate stares at him in shock

And just when we think she’s gonna rip his fucking head off --

She throws the bottle rocket to the ground Turns And RUNS

(CONTD) 28

ON SAWYER his spiteful expression dissolving into something
like REMORSE He picks up the bottle rocket by his feet
regards it for a moment before looking after her again
INT THE VALLEY - CAVE ENTRANCE - DAY 29

CHARLIE is ready for his climb through the tunnel Michael
hands him a flashlight

MICHAEL
Go slow and easy man Try not to
nudge any of the rocks around you

CHARLIE
Anything else

MICHAEL
Yeah Good luck

BOONE HURLEY
Be safe man --
-- Good luck Charlie

Sun and Walt offer smiles Jin Steve and Scott nod

CHARLIE
Thanks

And as the group watches Charlie enters
INT THE VALLEY - TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS 30

We go TIGHT ON CHARLIE’S FACE as he CRAWLS through the
claustrophobic tunnel

INT CONCERT VENUE - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT - FLASHBACK 31

ON CHARLIE as he PUSHES his way through a CROWD -- completely
oblivious to his presence -- congregated in a hallway leading
to a dressing room Charlie reaches the DOOR at the end of
the hall and pushes past a SECURITY GUARD into --

INT CONCERT VENUE - DRESSING ROOM - SAME - FLASHBACK 32

A dimly-lit dressing room (REDRESS) where Charlie spots IAN
across the room on a couch in a drugged-out stupor with
three equally zoned-out GROUPIES On the coffee table before
them a half-dozen FILM CANNISTERS and baggies of powder

CHARLIE
Bloody hell

(CONTD) 32

He SLAMS the door behind him causing Ian to look up

IAN
Hey Baby Brother Pull up a
bird and sit down

CHARLIE
(to Groupies )
Get out All of you get out

The girls just look at Ian for confirmation who shrugs

CHARLIE (cont’d)
NOW

The Groupies exit sloppily When the last one disappears --

CHARLIE (cont’d)
You missed the sound check You
don’t come to rehearsal anymore
And we’ve got a show in an hour --

IAN
Ooh a show I like shows

CHARLIE
All right Ian This is it
After tonight we cancel the rest
of the tour
(dead fucking serious)
We‘re walking away

IAN
What
CHARLIE IAN
Walk away Like we swore
wed do if things got too -- -- Are you raving Walk away
and go where
CHARLIE

(re drugs on table)
Youre killing yourself with this
junk You’re destroying Drive
Shaft --

IAN
I am Drive Shaft

Charlie reacts stung by that

(CONTD) 32

IAN (contd)
This is it End o’ the bleedin’
rainbow Try and enjoy it Cause
if you’re not with me
(pointedly)
Then what the bloody hell good are
you

And we can see from Charlie’s stunned expression that this is
a question he hasn’t asked himself in a long time Ian
grabs one of the CANNISTERS and pushes past Charlie in whom
we begin to see the glimmer of something new DESPERATION

As Ian exits into the hallway to the delight of the fans
Charlie crosses to a chair and sits burying his head in his
hands And when he opens his eyes he notices

One of the baggies of powder Charlie stares at it for a
moment listening to the crowd outside CHANTING Ian’s name
Then resignation comes to his face And as he picks it up
and reaches in to take his first hit WE FIND

INT THE VALLEY - TUNNEL - DAY 33

CHARLIE - struggling through the tunnel scrapes on his face
his flashlight finding the opening just up ahead Then --

A RUMBLE A few SMALL ROCKS fall down in front of him He
pushes his way through But it’s getting worse -- harder and
harder to see as --

INTERCUT WITH

Charlie picks up his pace crawling AS FAST AS HE CAN And
just as the TUNNEL COLLAPSES BEHIND HIM --

INT THE VALLEY - JACK’S CAVE - DAY 36

Charlie FLINGS HIMSELF into the open space where Jack is
But even that space is compromised as --

STREAMS OF DIRT AND ROCKS POUR INTO IT The air is black
CHOKED with dirt and dust And as JACK struggles to see
through the near-darkness coughing and gagging he spots
CHARLIE - looking at him almost sheepishly

CHARLIE
I’m uh here to rescue you

dug But it collapsed

KATE

So why isn’t anyone digging

MICHAEL

Kate --
(sensitive)

There’s nothing left to dig to

(CONTD) 38

Kate looks around at the others breathlessly desperately
Then she moves to the barrier wall and starts digging --
clearing away an impossibly large rock

MICHAEL (contd)
Kate

She doesn’t listen Just keeps digging

LOOKS pass between the rescue team Without a word they
each join her Despite the fact that it probably won’t make
a difference -- but doing it -- for Kate -- anyway And OFF
KATE’S LOOK OF DESPERATE DETERMINATION WE FIND --

standing on his manicured lawn helpless to stop Charlie --

42 INT THE VALLEY - JACK’S CAVE - DAY 42
ON JACK’S FACE as he catches his breath And with the dust
clearing he can see the perspiration on Charlie’s brow

the goose bumps the watery eyes and dilated pupils

JACK
How long’s it been Charlie

Charlie pulls away Puts on a smile
CHARLIE

Don’t know what you’re talking
about --

(CONTD) 42

JACK
How long since your last fix

Charlie looks at him too fucking worn down to deny it

CHARLIE
Almost a day and a half now

And that’s when we realize it Charlie DIDN’T take his drugs

back from Locke As Jack sits up --

JACK
How’s the withdrawal treating you
Any hallucinations

CHARLIE
Other than the conversation you and
I had in the jungle about an hour
ago no not really You have a
wonderful falsetto by the way

JACK
Why didn’t you say something man
I couldve helped you through it

CHARLIE

Charlie and Jack share a look Charlie manages a smile

CHARLIE
For the rest of our lives

JACK
(seeing the humor)
At the rate we’re using up the

CHARLIE
There’s a moth
JACK
A what
CHARLIE

(getting to his feet)
Right there Behind you It’s
There’s a bloody moth in here

He points the flashlight just past Jack to reveal A MOTH
Luminous ghostly beautiful It floats over to a nearby
wall and disappears into an unnoticed crack high up

CHARLIE (cont’d)
Hey --

Charlie climbs up on the boulder that once pinned Jack and
peers into the crack As Jack pulls himself to his feet
Charlie starts to dig Clumps of dirt fall away --

JACK CHARLIE
Charlie What are you -- -- Light I can see light

CHARLIE (cont’d)
The wall here -- It’s soft Look

Jack joins him digging at the wall with his good hand
Together they turn the crack into a larger hole As light
streams in FLARING THE LENS

dig She stops for a second to catch her breath and a hand
reaches in and touches her arm She turns to see

SAYID switches on his antenna the one connected to the
transceiver -- and we see CLOSE ON TRANSCEIVER - Bars Hes
getting BARS

SAYID (contd)
Yes Yes yes yes

As he slowly pivots his body away from CAMERA trying to find
the source A SHADOW falls over him Someone is behind
him Sayid senses it but before he can turn

WHAM A LARGE ROCK in the hand of someone we don’t see SLAMS
down on Sayid’s head

And as Sayid CRASHES to the ground unconscious

END OF ACT FOUR

ACT FIVE
INT THE VALLEY - NIGHT 47

PAN ACROSS the scene It’s an hour later and things are
settling down in the valley after Charlie and Jack’s return
Some of the people from the beach including Scott and Steve
have lingered There’s almost a celebratory feel

CHARLIE and JACK sit in front of a campfire blankets draped
over their shoulders as Hurley stops by to give them water
Charlie holds up his cut with a shaky hand

HURLEY
(to Charlie)
Dude You feeling okay You look
a little

JACK
Flu He’s got the flu

Charlie and Jack share a look an unspoken pact between them

HURLEY
Oh man That’s rough After all
youve been through Fightin’ a

flu bug
As he moves on Charlie catches sight of
HIS POV - LOCKE cooking the boar on a spit over a fire

Charlie looks at his trembling hands for a beat then stands

CHARLIE
(to Jack)
I’m just gonna stretch my legs
Jack nods and Charlie moves off We go with Charlie for a

bit until he crosses by

MICHAEL and WALT - We stay on them as a happy Walt climbs the
cave walls Michael holding VINCENT by his leash

WALT
This place is so cool Can we live
here

Before Michael answers he looks over his shoulder and we
RACK FOCUS on

JIN and SUN - at another fire across the camp

(CONTD) 47
RACK BACK to MICHAEL as he contemplates the complicated
relationship he has with both

MICHAEL
We‘ll uh talk about it pal

And for Walt that’s good enough for now

INT VALLEY - LOCKE’S CAMP - CONTINUOUS 48

ON LOCKE turning the boar on the spit when he hears

CHARLIE (0S)
Give them to me

Locke looks up to see Charlie and gives a heavy sigh

LOCKE
This is the third time you know
Are you sure you really want --

CHARLIE
I’m sure

Locke nods pulls the baggie of powder from his pocket
Hands it to Charlie Charlie regards the grimy bag in his
hand -- THEN TOSSES IT INTO LOCKE’S FIRE

Locke looks up at him Too hard to read Maybe impressed
Maybe surprised Maybe exactly what he expected Then --

LOCKE
I’m proud of you Charlie Always
knew you could do it

Charlie nods then suddenly notices

HIS POV - SEVERAL MOTHS dancing in the air near the flame
they’re forever drawn to And while Charlie continues to

stare at them LOCKE continues to stare at him Smiling
that smile

INT VALLEY - JACKS FIRE - CONTINUOUS 49

ON JACK still sitting by the fire when he hears

KATE (0S)
Hey --

Jack smiles as Kate sits down to join him

(CONTD) 49

KATE (cont’d)
Made you something

She shows him a loop of material the ends tied in a knot

JACK
(touched)
Ohh My very first sling

EXTRA CLOSE and INTIMATE as Kate pulls the blanket off him
drapes the sling around his neck and gently eases his sore
arm into it

JACK (contd)
Thank you

She smiles Then a little uncomfortable switches gears
KATE

So These are the safe caves you
were going on about

JACK
Okay one unsafe cave in this whole
valley

KATE

That you know of

After a beat

JACK
Does that mean you’re going back to
the beach

KATE

Sayid should be back there by now
If his plan worked

JACK
Then we’re one step closer to
getting off this island

Kate nods And there’s so much here What it all means
But for now he’s just gonna let it be

JACK (contd)
Thanks for the sling Kate

KATE
You’re welcome

(CONTD) 49
And OFF THESE TWO we find --
EXT STEEP GRASSY INCLINE (KUALOA RANCH) - NIGHT 50

SAYID lying on the ground right where we left him His eyes
slowly blink back to consciousness

He sits up disoriented His HEAD THROBBING Trying to
remember what happened

And it all comes back to him when he sees the antenna --
SMASHED on the ground by his side

SAYID
No

And then he spots something Crosses over PICKS IT UP--

THE TRANSCEIVER also completely destroyed

And as the awful truth washes over Sayid’s face -- that
someone doesn’t want the castaways finding the source of the
French transmission -- WE

BLACK OUT
