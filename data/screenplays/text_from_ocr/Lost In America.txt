asked before
DAVID
Okay fine I cant talk to
you Good night

David pretends like hes actually going to go to sleep

NANCY

(in a monotone obvi-

ously shes had to

say this many times

before)

DAVID

NANCY
Good night

DAVID
Good night

Nancy tries to go back to sleep David just lies
there

DAVID
(continuing)
But why that house

NANCY
What

DAVID
I think its too close to here
Its going to feel like the same
place Maybe we really didnt
think about this long enough

NANCY
We thought about it forever
We wanted more space That
house has more space

DAVID
Yes but the point of a house is
not just space You can rent
space Maybe we shouldve moved
into a completely different
neighborhood a step up or
something Maybe we shouldve
gotten a house with a tennis
court

NANCY
Why We dont play tennis

DAVID
Sure we dont play tennis We
dont have a court When you
have a court you learn

NANCY

Well possibly some day well
have a court and then we can
learn

DAVID
Let me ask you one more question
Why did we let Bekins do all of
our packing

NANCY
What

DAVID
Isnt that a waste of money We
couldve packed ourselves Maybe
we were too irresponsible

NANCY
I dont believe you One minute
you want a tennis court the next
minute youre worried about Bekins
packing a box My God Sometimes
I wish we really were irresponsible

DAVID
What does that mean

NANCY
Nothing Look get some sleep
okay Youll feel better

DAVID
Dont assume how Im feeling
What do you mean nothing If
youre saying we should be more
irresponsible I imagine you mean
were too responsible Is that
right

NANCY
Well sometimes I think that we
are too controlled yes

DAVID

Oh I see Well tell me
something How do you go out
and buy a four-hundred-thousand-
dollar house and let a moving
company pack everything and get
maids and servants and live the
good life and not be controlled

NANCY
What are you talking about

DAVID
It doesnt matter what Im
talking about

David gets up He takes his pillow with him
DAVID
(continuing)

Im going to sleep in the garage

NANCY
Dont do that

DAVID
Why not Im responsible I
should be guarding the car

NANCY
Youre insane

DAVID

(yelling from

the kitchen)
Youre right I am insane I
am insane and Im responsible
A very very good combination

We STAY in the bedroom with Nancy She lies there
Her eyes are open Shes staring straight ahead She
looks sad After a moment David reappears at the door

DAVID
I am not an animal

NANCY
What
DAVID
I am not an animal I will not

sleep in the garage

NANCY
Just come to bed Come on

DAVID

(sitting down on

the bed)
I apologize okay But dont
call me names

NANCY
What names

DAVID
You know what names Calling me
responsible is saying what That
Im closed up Im old Im
stodgy Thats not fair I
dont like the way things are any
more than anybody else does but
what am I supposed to do Im
trying What about you Youre
as responsible as I am Personnel
Director for a department store is
not the most irresponsible job in
the world Go hire anyone you
want Think youd be fired fast
if you did that How much freedom
do you have Were all in the
same boat Were trying to make
something of ourselves and its
hard Okay

NANCY
Youre very upset Im sorry I
used that word

DAVID
No Im glad you used that word
Its honest but things are going
to get better Theyre going to
change

NANCY
You always say that

DAVID
Yes but this time its different
After tomorrow Im no longer an
employee Im a Vice President
Ill be my own boss Ill have
a piece of the company You see
what I mean I can be more
irresponsible because Ill be in
a position of responsibility
That makes sense doesnt it

NANCY
I dont know I guess it does
Good night

DAVID

Okay go to sleep

Nancy and David both lie down each facing the oppo-
site direction After a few seconds

DAVID

(continuing)
It does make sense and things

Well thats not my first choice
but whats the alternative And
Im not blaming David I know
he genuinely believes that being
made Vice President is going to
change things But he genuinely
believed that every promotion
would change things It never
does Maybe for a few days but

10 INT PAUL DUNNS OFFICE

PAUL DUNN is one of the heads of the advertising agency
He certainly holds the top position on the West Coast

His office is large It smells of success Obviously
this is a man who has made a great deal of money and spent
it where people can see it As David enters he sees

Paul sitting behind his desk and a baldheaded gentleman
BRAD TOOLEY seated on the couch Brad Tooley is in his
early forties very well-dressed in the upper Eastern
advertising establishment manner As David comes in
Brad and Paul both get up

PAUL
(his hand out-
stretched)

Hello David How are you

DAVID

Im fine Im excited
PAUL

Me too
DAVID

Thats wonderful

PAUL
David Id like you to meet Brad
Tooley

DAVID
Brad its a pleasure

David and Brad shake hands

PAUL
Brad has recently joined the agency
in New York He was one of the best
men at Doyle Dane and Bernbach
We were lucky to get him

DAVID
Well thats exciting

They all sit down again David doesnt know quite what
to make of the fact that Brad is in this meeting He
just assumes this is part of the ceremony of being made
vice president

PAUL
David I dont have to tell you
what I think of you You know I
feel youre one of the most
creative people in this company
I was telling Brad earlier the
accounts youve been responsible
for

BRAD
Very impressive The Knudsen
Orange Juice campaign was one of
the best Ive ever seen Ever

DAVID

(he smiles hes

in his glory)
Well thank you

PAUL
Brad has joined this company for
a very special reason David
were going to get Ford

David now thinking of himself as the vice president
realizes that Ford is an account of such proportion
that the profit participation could be enormous His
eyes widen

DAVID
Oh my God Thats wonderful

PAUL
Well it finally puts us at the
top of the heap

DAVID
Im stunned When did this happen

PAUL

Just in the last few days Youre
really the first to know out here
We didnt want to say anything until
it was final

DAVID
Thats wonderful Just wonderful
God what a week What a week for
all of us

PAUL
It certainly is Now David

DAVID

(interrupts)
Paul you dont have to say
anything As the new vice president
I know what this means to the
company Im here twenty-four
David is not quite sure what hes just heard
maybe hes heard a compliment

city

hours a day

PAUL
David youre too valuable to
become vice president Id like
you to move to New York and work
under Brad You two are going
to be in charge of Ford Youre
going to have to hurry though
You start in three weeks

He thinks

Hes heard a name of a

a car some weeks but he hasnt put it together
He needs to hear it again

DAVID
Wait a second You gave me too
much information Im valuable
and Im vice president

PAUL
No David Ive hired Paul
Shubano as vice president

DAVID
What

BRAD
Hes giving you quite a compliment
David I asked him for the best
man he had and he didnt hesitate
for a moment

DAVID
He didnt Well I dont want to
move to New York

PAUL
What

DAVID
I want to be the vice president
I want to be a stockholder in this
company It was promised to me
I dont mind working on Ford
Dont get me wrong I think it
would be a joy to work on but Ill
work on it as vice president Ive
been here eight years Paul I
dont want to be transferred to
just another account

PAUL
This is not just another account
David

BRAD
Its Ford

DAVID
Brad I know its Ford Ive owned
Fords okay Now Paul I feel its
only fair to keep your promise

PAUL
I didnt promise you anything

DAVID
Wait a minute What about these
lunches that weve been having
for the last four years I believe
we talked about grooming me for
vice president Phil Shubanos
been here only three years Why

PAUL
Well first of all quite frankly
hes not as clever as you Hes
more of an executive type

DAVID
Oh great I think thats wonderful
So by being extra clever I get
thrown out of the town that I live
in with no promotion no nothing
and just shifted to another account
He on the other hand because of
his low intelligence and short time
with the company stays here gets
a large amount of stock and becomes
vice president Well that makes
sense

PAUL
You keep referring to this as
another account Its not

Its Ford
DAVID
Why dont you stop saying that
You sound like Dinah Shore Now
damn it look this isnt fair
(stops for a minute
begins to laugh)
Paul if Im working myself up and
this is a joke Ill kill you
Are they going to burst in here
and say “Surprise Goddamnit
You almost had me fooled

PAUL
No ones bursting in here David
Im offering you something very big

DAVID
No ones bursting in here

PAUL
No

DAVID
No Oh God But wait a minute
Im vice president right

PAUL
No

DAVID
Yes

PAUL
No

DAVID

Stop saying no Just a minute

I cant go to New York This is
my home My wife and I live here
I just bought a four-hundred
thousand dollar house Im
picking tile out at this very
moment What am I going to do
Burn it down

PAUL
Dont worry about that please
You wont lose a penny on the house
Well take care of it I think
Ford is more important than a
single family dwelling anyway
Well get you more than you paid
for it The important thing is
that you and Brad get along

DAVID
Me and Brad get along Are you
crazy
Ive worked here eight years for
what For me and Brad to get
long I was born in this city
ll my friends are here I like
t Were joking arent we
his is a joke

Bh Dm

PAUL
What do you mean a joke

DAVID
What do you mean a joke

PAUL
I didnt say a joke

DAVID
Im going to New York City

PAUL
Id like you there in three weeks

DAVID
Oh you would

PAUL
This can be a stepping stone to
something bigger David

DAVID

Whats bigger than being vice
president Thats all I want
Maybe Im wrong but I think Ive
already stepped on every stone

we have here havent I

PAUL
Well someday you might be vice
president
DAVID
Someday What do you mean Its
today Ive got it

PAUL
You dont have it

DAVID
Who has it

PAUL
David I cant say this again
Phil Shubano

DAVID
Well obviously Im blocking this
mans name arent I

BRAD
David I dont know all of your
work but I do know youve got to
be the best here or you wouldnt
be working with me on this account

DAVID
Brad shut up Dont talk This

doing Ive been with this company
a very very long time Im one of
the oldest employees on this coast

deserve I will be made vice
president and I will get the stock
and I will participate in the
ownership of the company and thats
that

PAUL
My God I thought youd be thrilled

DAVID
You thought Id be thrilled I
cant believe it Why the hell

so thrilling come on Ill take
you to the airport Ill put you
on a plane right now
PAUL
Dont talk to me like that I
came from New York

DAVID
Yeah thats right and you dont
want to go back because as soon
as you land at the airport
people steal everything youve got

BRAD
I resent that Thats a clich®
New Yorks the greatest city there
is

DAVID
Sit down Just sit down and shut

up

PAUL
David thats enough

DAVID
No I havent even started yet
Now listen lets say a giant
mistake was made Pretend none of
this was ever said Im the vice
president Everything will be
fine Ill stay here Ill work

the best man do He stands next to
the groom and watches the groom
become vice president

PAUL
I can see youre upset Ill forget
what you said earlier I dont think
you want to jeopardize eight years
with this company

DAVID
Fuck you

PAUL
Thats it Get out

DAVID
I wasted my youth for you and
for what What do you mean
jeopardize eight years What
eight years All I did was live
for the future Why didnt you
tell me a long time ago that I
was too clever You should have
told me five years ago then I

PAUL
(presses a buzzer)

DAVID
Oh I cant believe it Security

eight years back Give me my
life back I want my eight years
back Give them to me

Paul stares at him Brad gets up

BRAD
Im going back to the hotel David
youre making a big mistake

DAVID
You dont even know me you
baldheaded fart

Brad stares at him and then walks out He turns back to
Paul

DAVID

(continuing)
I cant believe that I almost
wasted my entire life here
Ive been waiting very very
patiently and I realize now what
wouldve happened This wouldve
gone on for years and years and
years and when I was seventy I
wouldve gotten a watch Actually
you wouldnt even have given me a
watch You wouldve told me I was
too clever that I would instinctively
know the time You know something
Paul I made fun of my friends who
dropped out of college and went to
find themselves I told them they
were stupid I laughed at them
And what did I do I went with
you Good choice wasnt it What
did I get for doing that A transfer
I couldve gotten that from a bus
Youre a human bus Jesus Christ
You liar I dont know where those
drop-outs are today but Ive got
to find them I owe them a big
apology Cause let me tell you
something They have more integrity
on their little tab of acid than
you have in your entire body you
big fucking jerk
A security guard enters

PAUL

(stands up)
Would you escort Mr Howard out
please

DAVID
He doesnt have to escort me out
Im honored to leave

David opens the office door He begins to yell so
everyone can hear him This is reminiscent of the
scene from Network

DAVID

(continuing)
Before I leave I think its very
important for everyone in this
company to know what went on in
here today
I dont know how many lunches youve
all had with that man and I dont
know what hes said over salad or
dessert or whatever he buys you
but you better not believe it
Hes a real smoothie Hell tell
you about the stepping stones
Thats his favorite expression
Hell tell you about the stepping
stones and where they lead Well
I found out where they lead To
a baldheaded fat man in New York
Get out Get out now Smell the
roses Smell anything Just smell
Smell before its too late

life is all about Well find people
who are really searching Well find
people who are willing to take a
chance Look Ill just get all
excited and get into it all again
You go and finish what you have to
do and then Ill see you tonight

David exits Nancy watches him go Shes expressionless
She doesnt quite know what to make of this You can
sense that part of her thinks that maybe her prayers were
answered maybe this is how the marriage can be saved

You can also sense that part of her isnt sure her husband
is sane Maybe this wont last more than an hour and you
can sense the last part of her is still embarrassed that
the other employees she works with have heard words like

fuck and jacking off This is a woman of many parts

L4 INT THE HOWARDS HOME - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

David and Nancy are sitting on the floor

Theyre surrounded by various maps atlases and cata-
logues that show different pieces of property around
the United States property that most people forget
even exist These places look amazing in their little
pictures and in fact they might be amazing Its
just that almost no one ever gets there to see them for
real The longer Nancy has a chance to see what her
husband is saying the more excited she becomes

NANCY
(looking in one of
the catalogues)
Look at this This is the cutest
farmhouse Ive ever seen Twenty-
four acres near Darien Connecticut
five bedrooms eighty thousand
dollars How could that be

DAVID
Because its there Its not here
Were used to this city You know
what our new house would cost if
it were where this farmhouse was
Not four hundred thousand maybe
sixty thousand if we were lucky

Nancy is still looking at pages in the catalogue She
stops at one picture She is fascinated

NANCY
My God Look at this A converted
lighthouse in Maine fifty-five
thousand two bedrooms a living
room a kitchen a playroom How
do you put this into a lighthouse

DAVID
Well maybe you go to Maine and
find out Or you dont You do
anything you want Nancy look
at this

He opens a piece of paper showing her the arithmetic
he has worked on all afternoon

DAVID

(continuing)
This seems to make sense to me
You tell me what you think
The one good thing about spending
all this time in Los Angeles was
that we got a free ride on this
bullshit inflation train Dont
ask me how it happened but we made
a hundred and ninety thousand dollar
profit by staying in this house
for less than five years Now
that was money we were never going
to see cause we were about to put
it back into another stupid house
Okay We pull out of that house
we lose our fifteen thousand dollars
in Escrow we take the money from
this house we liquidate everything
else we have cars stocks bonds
everything Nancy we have two
hundred thousand dollars

NANCY
We couldnt

DAVID
We do

David shows her the figures As Nancy looks at the piece
of paper he continues

DAVID

(continuing)
All we need to buy is a motor
home and we should get a great
one because we might live there
for the rest of our lives or
for five years or ten years or
whatever

NANCY
What do you think a motor home
costs

DAVID
Guess who went motor home shopping
We can get a great one for twenty-
five thousand dollars If theres
one thing you can get a deal on
its a motor home This is the best
time in history to drop out Its
a buyers market

NANCY
So that would leave us a hundred
and seventy-five thousand dollars
I cant believe it

DAVID
Yes On that kind of money we
could ramble across the country
for years We can paint we can
explore we can meet amazing
people
NANCY
And if we get to Connecticut and
we like one of these farmhouses
wed have enough money to put a
down payment on it wouldnt we

DAVID
Yes Then if we get sick of that
we could sell it and move on

NANCY
Id like to go to Alaska

DAVID
Great Alaskas great We can
do anything we want

NANCY
This is what we talked about when
we were nineteen

DAVID
Yes We talked about finding
ourselves but we laughed it off
because we had no money Now
we can do it in comfort Weve
got our nest egg This is a
dream come true

Nancy has a tear in her eye David sees it

DAVID
(continuing)
Whats wrong Are you okay

NANCY
We really can do whatever we
want to cant we

DAVID
Whos stopping us

Nancy stares She thinks about that question She
cant come up with an answer Finally almost in
tears

NANCY
Nobodys stopping us

15 INT PETE HIRSCHS HOME - NIGHT

PETE HIRSCH is one of Davids former associates at the
agency He and his wife are throwing a party for

David and Nancy a final farewell gathering There are
people milling about talking general good cheer

corner of the room is a huge cake The CAMERA MOVES
ABOUT PICKING UP various bits of conversation

PATTY

JACK MARTIN and his wife CAROL approach Nancy Obvi-

ously hes an executive at Robinsons

JACK MARTIN

I think it sounds wonderful

CUT TO
16 INT OTHER SIDE OF THE ROOM

A group of men are gathered around David One of
Davids friends at work JIM is speaking
JIM

You were great Man it was great
It was like Network and Take
This Job and Shove It all rolled
into one When you left we all
wanted to go with you Really
People really had to think for a
minute They were ready to leave

DAVID
Did anyone else leave

JIM

No I mean after a few minutes
people just went back to work
but for the moment it was real
exciting

DAVID
Well when the times right if
people want to leave they will

JIM
Of course I believe that I
got to be honest with you though
I was thinking about my situation
and I dont think I have the guts

DAVID
I dont know that its guts It
just takes a certain kind of person

JIM
Yeah maybe it has nothing to do
with guts Cause I think I have

guts I guess Im not that kind
of person Lets say that I like
expensive things and I guess I
need my job to get what I like

DAVID
Whatever makes you happy

JIM
Right I guess expensive things
make me happy These shoes make
me happy Do you like them

He shows David his shoes They look very expensive
For a moment David forgets he will no longer partic-
ipate in this world

DAVID
Beauties What are they Ballys

JIM
A Bally copy Ballys would be
three hundred bucks These were
a hundred and eighty Cant tell
the difference The soles just
as thick Look feel the sole

DAVID

(starts to touch the

bottom of his shoe

and then stops)
No I dont know where youve been
Jim I dont want to touch your
shoe Theyre beautiful Good
thick sole

Nancy calls across the room to David

NANCY
Honey

David walks over and recognizes one of her bosses Jack
Martin

DAVID
Hello Jack How are you

JACK
Daniel Boone as I live and
breathe Dan you know my wife
Carol

DAVID
(shakes hands)
Hi Carol

JACK
So Mr Boone you leave in the
morning uh

DAVID
Lets call me David from now on
Just for old times sake
JACK
Oh come on Im just playing with
you Listen Ill tell you
something What you and your
wife are doing well its wonderful
Carol and I were driving over here
tonight and talking seriously
about breaking the mold ourselves

DAVID
Really

JACK
You bet We havent been that
happy lately Have we honey

How can a person respond to this Carol just stares
at him

JACK

(continuing)
I told her if I can get some time
off were going to try to get down
to La Costa for a weekend and just
let it all out

David now realizes that breaking the mold has many
different meanings to different people

DAVID
La Costa For a whole weekend
huh Thats great

JACK
Thats if I can get away If not
at least for an afternoon Just
the idea of getting to San Diego
maybe take in Sea World Anyway
did Nancy tell you what Robinsons
plans to do

DAVID
Actually we havent talked too much
about American business lately

JACK
Well there is a rumor and I would
appreciate you not telling anyone
this but our store may just be
buying up the May Company This is
just the kind of expansion that can
make a man like me very very
wealthy

DAVID
Well if its good for you Im
real happy

JACK

Well lets just say it could make
me a million dollars minimum But
David please keep this down God
I probably shouldnt have said
anything

DAVID
Jack were not going to be around
people who will care I promise
you I dont think a guide at
the Grand Canyon knows or cares
too much about the acquisition of
a department store in LA

JACK
You want a surprise You want to
know about the Grand Canyon and
business The 7-Eleven at the
Grand Canyon does more volume
business per year than any other
7-Eleven in the country especially
around Muscular Dystrophy time

DAVID
Well thats good to know

JACK
I think it has something to do
with the hiking and the tragedy
of the children who cant hike
I dont know but last year they
did two million eight-hundred
thousand Now of course there
are no other quickie stores around
so they have a good one there A
lot of people moving in and out
of that canyon Have you seen
these new U-Tote-M stores

DAVID
Jack I dont want to be rude but
I cant talk business anymore I
hate to sound sixties to you
but Im in a different place

JACK
Hey I understand I remember
the sixties
As a matter of fact the concept
of U-Tote-M is a sixties concept
See the 7-Eleven is a rush-rush
place U-Tote-M is lay-back Their
store in Tarzana this year is
going to gross almost

DAVID
(interrupts)
Jack please

Pete Hirsch yells from across the room

PETE
Id like to make a toast

People mumble Great Good Its about time
Everybody gathers around People raise their glasses

up

PETE
(continuing)
To our beautiful friends David
and Nancy Howard Good luck
He drinks
DAVID

Thats it huh What a well thought
out toast Thank you Pete

People laugh Scattered laughter around the room
DAVID
(continuing)
Well I think its time for me

to say something right now

We hear a little applause Speech Speech
DAVID
(continuing calling
Nancy over)

Sweetheart would you come here

David and Nancy stand together arm-in-arm

People

DAVID

(continuing)
I have a surprise for my wife and
I would like to share it not only
with her but with you who we
consider our closest friends We
do have some other close friends
Im sure they got lost

laugh

DAVID

(continuing)
When Nancy and I were married we
had dreams and plans and I guess
in the pursuit of those things
we kind of lost each other
Tomorrow morning when we leave
here we have no destination
Our only goal is to find out who
we really are and what it is thats
really out there Were going to
be adventurers in the classic sense
of the word but there is one place
that we will stop at first

(reaches into his

pocket and takes

out a little box)
That place is Las Vegas Nevada

NANCY

(her eyes open up

wide excited)
Las Vegas Really

DAVID
Well if this is to be a new
beginning I think theres only
one way to really show it to this
woman that I love So tomorrow
evening my wife and I are going
to be remarried

People applaud Nancy is overwhelmed She opens the
little box and there is a ruby ring

NANCY
Oh my God Oh My

People are trying to get a glance at the ring We can
hear OOHING and AAHING

NANCY

(continuing)
This is the most beautiful thing
youve ever done

DAVID
Well Id like to say it was
nothing but that small little
ruby cost a fortune

People laugh

DAVID
(continuing)
Thats okay its budgeted for

A little laughter again

DAVID

(continuing)
And now I would like to propose
a toast

Everyone raises their glasses

DAVID

(continuing)
To you our loyal friends we will
miss you To my lovely new bride
I want to know you all over again
And to America get ready Here
we come

Everybody drinks As they do we

CUT TO
17 EXT SAN BERNARDINO FREEWAY - NEXT DAY

We hear MUSIC (possibly the song from Easy Rider when
Dennis Hopper and Peter Fonda left LA on their motor-
cycles) This is the first time we see the motor home
No expense was spared on this Its seventy feet long
From the outside you can see a roof that doubles as a
little patio where you can sun yourself The windows
are huge It looks luxurious even from a distance

CUT TO

18 INT MOTOR HOME

David is driving Nancy is in the back in the kitchen
area

DAVID
Honey were two minutes from
crossing the city limits Come

of the trailer)
Just a second This microwave
oven browns did you know that
The one in our new house couldnt

DAVID
Our new house No some poor
suckers new house This is our
new house and I love it

Nancy walks up towards the front with two melted cheese
sandwiches No matter how horrible the sandwiches looked
or tasted to David it would be great Thats his new
attitude

DAVID

(continuing)
Boy does this smell good How
long did it take to melt this

NANCY
Twenty seconds
DAVID
Can you believe it Boy I
never really tasted melted cheese
on toast before I must have
eaten it a million times but
this is the first time Ive really
tasted it Its good and I bet
it gets better the further we
get from LA

NANCY
Well actually be breathing clean
air We havent done that for --
how many years

DAVID
Forever I hope we can recognize
it

Nancy smiles This is certainly the best mood shes
been in for a long time

NANCY
Last night was so nice dont you
think Those are good people
We had good friends there

DAVID
I know Its just that we werent
good friends there

NANCY
Every once in a while I cant
believe what were doing Are
you scared Be honest

DAVID
No not at all Well lets say
Im scared in the same way
Columbus was scared

NANCY
Columbus must have really been
scared huh That took a lot
of guts didnt it What if
the world was flat They really
didnt know anything

DAVID

The town is all lit up
front of a 24-hour wedding chapel

Well I think he covered himself

NANCY
How

DAVID
Oh lets say there was the Pinta
the Nina and the Santa Maria Id
bet everything I have that Columbus
was in the Santa Maria If the
world was flat I think hed watch
the Pinta and the Nina go Then
hed tell the Santa Maria to turn
around Hed probably just go back
and have sex with the Queen again
I dont think he was a complete
schmuck

NANCY
So actually were braver than
Columbus We dont have two motor
homes in front of us

DAVID
Thats right However we should
keep our eye on that Buick ahead
If it falls off the earth it
would be wise to pull over and re-
evaluate

EXT LAS VEGAS - NIGHT TIME

EXT DESERT INN - NIGHT

CUT TO
David pulls the motor home into the parking lot and
turns over the keys to the young parking attendant

22 INT LOBBY OF DESERT INN

David and Nancy are coming through the main doors

We can see the motor home being driven out of the drive-
way by one of the valet parking attendants David

looks behind him and watches the home drive off Hes
nervous

DAVID
I dont think they know how to
drive those things He could
ruin it

NANCY

(all excited)
Oh dont worry They can drive
anything Look Isnt this
wonderful Its so romantic
God I used to come here a lot
I kind of miss it

DAVID
You never told me you came here
When

NANCY
Before we were married Ill
tell you about it later Come
on

They approach the front desk A CLERK is working at
one of the reservation computers

CLERK
Excuse me

DAVID
My wife and I have dropped out of
society and were making this
statement but we want to spend
one last night here Were
planning to get up at the crack
of dawn and get remarried and

NANCY
(interrupting David
she whispers to him)
Just ask him for the room

DAVID

(whispering back)
Im getting to it I know what
Im doing

(to the Clerk)
Anyway were going to get up
very early and get remarried
so we want something very special
because were doing something
special My point is wed
like your finest bridal suite

CLERK
Do you have a reservation

DAVID
No I told you we just dropped
out We dont do reservation
things anymore Were living
spontaneously

CLERK
Well were not We thrive on
reservations and Im sorry but
the bridal suite is occupied

DAVID
What other rooms do you have

NANCY
(to the Clerk)
Just a minute please
(she pulls David
aside whispering)
The bridal suite isnt occupied

DAVID
What

NANCY
Its not occupied I can see it
in his face

DAVID
What do you mean
NANCY
Give him money

DAVID
What

NANCY
Give him fifty bucks

DAVID
Why

NANCY
Well get the bridal suite

DAVID
How do you know

NANCY
Trust me

David approaches the desk again He takes out fifty
dollars He puts it in the Clerks hand like hes
shaking hands with him

DAVID
Hello again
(slips him the

fifty)
Do me a favor Ive worked with
computers I know what can happen

Sometimes these things get fouled
up Would you check one more

time

Maybe the bridal suite was empty

and the room next to it was occupied
and the computer got mixed up

CLERK
(takes a look)
I know what you mean That can
happen sometimes Let me check
(he looks at the
reservation com-
puter for a moment)
Nope Its occupied These are
state-of-the-art computers Very
rarely do we have those kind of
mistakes

DAVID
Youre sure

CLERK
Yes Says right here Bridal
Suite full

Nancy leans over and whispers to David

NANCY
Give him more

DAVID
Jesus Really

Nancy nods yes David turns back to the Clerk

DAVID

(continuing)
Listen Im not very good at this
I dont get good seats in shows
because of this problem I dont
get good tables in restaurants
Ive really never been good at
this particular kind of exchange
of money so how much do you
want

CLERK
A hundred dollars

DAVID
Fine

(hands him more cash)
Here you go A hundred
Now I assume we dont have to
continue this computer talk
again and say that its working
now and everything

The Clerk doesnt even bother to answer He reaches
behind the desk and hands David his key

CLERK
Here you are eight-twenty

He rings for the porter
DAVID
Now this is the best bridal
suite

CLERK
Heart-shaped bed Everything
Youll love it

DAVID
Thank you very much Im sure
the hundred doesnt apply towards
the room at all

CLERK
Youre kidding right

DAVID
Of course I was kidding all
along

David and Nancy leave the desk and walk towards the
elevator

DAVID

(continuing)
Tell me we didnt do the right
thing getting out of this horrible
society Jesus Christ I told the
guy we dropped out Did that make
any difference No I said were
making a statement What did he do
Stare at me I said were getting
remarried What does he finally
say Give me more money God
How does a guy like that even live

NANCY
Well think of all the people
checking in here Everyone giving
him a hundred dollars he probably
lives well

DAVID
No I meant with himself How
does he Never mind

CUT TO
23 INT BEDROOM SUITE - DESERT INN

David and Nancy enter Apparently the hundred

dollars was not quite enough This could not be

Desert Inns best bridal suite This looks like the
junior bridal suite at best At one end of the room
are two twin heart-shaped beds Above them theres a
mirror heavily-flocked with gold specks The rest of
the room is decorated in standard red velour Nancy is
disappointed David is confused He cant figure out
how any manufacturer could make a living turning out
twin heart-shaped beds

PORTER
Ill go down and get your luggage
for you Where is it

DAVID
Thats okay Its locked in our
house Ill get it later Thank
you very much

David reaches into his pocket and gives the man a dollar

DAVID

(continuing)
I havent been here in years I
hope this is enough If it isnt
take some from the clerk I gave
him a hundred

The Porter looks at David and walks out without saying
a word

NANCY
So What do you think

DAVID
I think if Liberace had children
this would be their room Cute
little hearts arent they

NANCY
We should ask for a bigger bed

DAVID
Lets hold onto the cash we have
I dont want any more favors
We can try and push these together

They try but they find very quickly that hearts dont
fit together After a few attempts they give up

DAVID

(continuing)
Look we can crawl over the
ventricles when we want to have
sex Itll be exciting Why
dont you order something up
okay Order up a great meal and
some great champagne Ill go
run the bath

David walks into the bathroom Nancy sits down on the
bed She picks up the room service menu and starts to
read through it She calls to David

NANCY
Hows the bath

DAVID
(walking out of
the bathroom)
Theres no bath in there honey

NANCY
Come on

DAVID
I have no reason to lie to you
Go look for yourself Theres a
very teeny heart-shaped
shower and a medium sized heart-
shaped sink At best we can
wash our socks together

NANCY
Are you disappointed

DAVID
Not at all

NANCY
Maybe we shouldnt order room
service We should get dressed
and go down and check out some
of these restaurants Hey do

Its ringing

you want to see a show

DAVID
I dont want to leave the room
I just want to be with you tonight
here Its our honeymoon We
should order up like we planned
and then we can figure out a way
to make love Somewhere in this
room there has to be space

NANCY
Okay
(gets up and walks
toward the bath-
room)
Im going in to take a nice hot
shower okay

DAVID
Good You get nice and sexy
because when you come out well
pack and leave

NANCY
Come on Were going to have fun

DAVID
Im joking with you Now hurry
up Im getting horny When you
come out Ill be the naked one
on the right heart I might even
be looking at myself in the mirror
and masturbating Although I
dont think I can see myself
through all this gold flock

SHOT OF ALARM CLOCK

table Theres a small group of people around her They
seem to be watching she seems to be gambling David

28 INT LOBBY

David walks very slowly towards Shusters office You

and clears his throat trying to act dignified The robe
diminishes this a bit

DAVID

(to the Clerk)
Mr Shuster the Pit Boss may I

David stands there Hes thinking staring straight
ahead Out of an office emerges JACK SHUSTER the Pit
Boss the man we saw earlier Shusters a large man
in his early fifties Hes as intimidating as his

job calls for He looks like he might have killed
somebody once and actually enjoyed it He walks
over to David

SHUSTER
Mr Howard Come on in

CUT TO

29 INT SHUSTERS OFFICE

David tries to compose himself even more as he follows
Shuster into his office Davids story is now formed
He knows what he wants to say He feels confident
David enters the office He sits down in front of
Shusters desk

DAVID
First of all let me say Ive
heard a great deal about you

SHUSTER

(suspicious)
What do you mean From who
What did you hear

DAVID
Oh I just meant Ive heard
wonderful things from everybody
in general from the whole hotel

SHUSTER

(relieved)
Well thats very nice Thank
you

DAVID

No thank you

SHUSTER
Is your wife feeling better

DAVID
Yes she is

SHUSTER
So what can I do for you

DAVID
I have a very interesting idea
I think youll be taken by it

Shuster stares at him

DAVID

(continuing)
I was a key executive with a major
advertising agency - one of the
biggest in the world

SHUSTER
Yes right So

DAVID
Well I was the Idea Man there
So when I say I have an interesting
idea Im not speaking like any slob
that walks in off the street

SHUSTER
Okay

DAVID

(clearing his throat

about to enter into

The Big Story)
My wife and I we dropped out of
society She had a very important
position in a department store and
again I remind you that I was one
of the highest executives in the
worlds largest advertising firm

Shuster just stares at him

DAVID

(continuing)
Anyway we were going to find
ourselves Then we thought maybe
were too old its too late We
cant find ourselves thats only
for kids And then we thought about
it some more and it hit us Wait a
minute Whos to say at what age
you stop being a kid

SHUSTER
You gotta have some age How else
could a court separate rape from
fun In this state its eighteen
by the way

DAVID
Yes But my point is we wanted
to find ourselves and we did and
we dropped out just like they
did in Easy Rider

SHUSTER
Easy what

DAVID
The movie Easy Rider Famous
movie Important movie

SHUSTER

Didnt see that Im sorry

DAVID

Its a classic If it comes on
cable here see it Anyway we
did something that no one has done
for a long time Maybe no one has
ever done it because in the movie
they were movie stars so they
didnt really do it even though
they portrayed people that did it

SHUSTER
Im getting mixed up here What
is your point

DAVID
Well we did it for real We
quit our jobs and we sold everything
that we had The only thing we own
is our little motor home which is
parked outside Thats all weve
got and we were going to spend
years roaming around this beautiful
country but we knew we couldnt
do it unless we had our little
nest egg tucked away in the bank

SHUSTER
(interrupts)
Im going off duty in a few minutes
Now your point is what

DAVID
Im getting to it Why did we
come to Las Vegas Because it was
a new beginning and I wanted to
remarry my lovely wife Thats
nice dont you think

SHUSTER
Very nice

DAVID
I wanted to get remarried but I
wanted to spend our honeymoon in
the Grand Canyon places like we
intend to spend the rest of our
lives in but my wife is very fond
of your hotel and all of the
employees and she said Oh come
on lets spend our honeymoon here
And we did and the room was very
lovely and everybody was very nice
to us but my wife lost the nest
egg

SHUSTER
Mr Howard stop right here I
think I know what youre getting at
I realize youve lost a great deal
here and I want you to know that
your room and your meals are comped

DAVID
Thats very nice but thats not
exactly what Im saying I think
I have a multi-million dollar idea
Now you have to be very secretive
about what Im going to tell you
because the other hotels if they
heard about it well theyll grab
it in a minute

David leans over Shusters desk and whispers to make
the idea really sound secretive

DAVID
(continuing)
I think as an experiment you
give us back the money we lost

SHUSTER
I beg your pardon

DAVID
Well imagine the publicity I
mean the Hilton for example
they have billboards all over LA
where they put the faces of the
winners of those slot machines
Now those people win a couple
hundred thousand dollars but the
hotel is getting millions of
dollars of publicity with those
billboards because people drive
by and say Gee the Hilton looks
like a nice place Look at those
smiling people So what about a
billboard with my wife and I on it
and we would be smiling and there
would be a saying something like
These people dropped out of society
they couldnt take it any longer
but they made a mistake They
lost their nest egg at The Desert
Inn but The Desert Inn gave it
back And maybe there could be
some kind of a visual with you
handing us an egg or something
Now I mean Im just formulating
this now as Im talking but you
can imagine when its worked
out how effective it could be

SHUSTER

(chuckling)
Thats wonderful

(he gets up)
Well Mr Howard nice to meet
you

DAVID
What do you mean nice to meet
me You said this is wonderful

SHUSTER
Were kidding each other here
right
(starts to

laugh again)
I gotta tell you this is one of
the best things Ive ever heard
Whats the board gonna say again
Gamblers come and get your
money back

(he laughs)
Great Thats great

DAVID
(standing up)
No No Wait Not Gamblers

get your money back

Thats wrong Were not gamblers
Were the few people in society
that have tried to do something
with our lives See Were drop-
outs Were finding ourselves
Someones got to help the few
people like us because if they
dont nobody will ever drop out
again Nobody will ever have

the courage to find themselves

SHUSTER
Well I understand what you mean
but I dont think The Desert Inn
can help find you Im sorry but
thank you for the idea and good
night

He begins to escort David to the door

DAVID

(stopping him)
Listen Ive experienced this
before Ive had clients that
didnt understand the idea until
they saw it on television and
then they said My God What a
brilliant idea Why didnt I
understand this I might have
used the wrong phrase Okay
picture this maybe my wife
and I will do a television
commercial for you and there
could be a jingle and it could
go

(begins to sing)
The Desert Inn has heart The
Desert Inn has heart The Desert
Inn has heart Something like
that See what I mean

SHUSTER
Thats a nice jingle Mr Howard
lets assume youre serious here
What if this caught on Could you
imagine what would happen Why
we would have to return everybodys
losses The casino would just
crumble We couldnt pay our bills
You know the casino accounts for
a great deal of our profits

DAVID
I understand Of course you dont
pay back everybodys losses You
make a distinct division between
the bold who are out there searching
and all the other schmucks who come
here to see Wayne Newton

SHUSTER
I see Now I like Wayne Newton
So I fall into what category

DAVID

(realizing this was

not the best example)
Oh look I picked a name out of a
hat I like Wayne Newton too
Im saying a schmuck representing
the gambler and a bold person
representing me and my wife and the
one or two others that probably
wouldnt come here anyway You
wouldnt have to do this more than
once or twice theres not too many
bold people around I think it was
a mistake to use entertainers as
the dividing line We could find
another system Anyway what do
you say We do need that nest egg
back

SHUSTER
I say good luck to you and stay
away from the tables next time

DAVID
Oh thats for sure but come on
Half the money for courage

Shuster opens up his office door He escorts David out

30 INT LOBBY AT FRONT DESK

SHUSTER
Mr Howard nice to meet you
A pleasure

DAVID
Hold it What about Miracle
on 34th Street

SHUSTER
Christmas picture right

DAVID

(now rambling on very

fast desperate rea-

lizing his plan is

about to fail)
More than a Christmas picture What
happened there Macys didnt want
to send their customers to Gimbles
because the president of Macys
thought they would lose all of their
ustomers and lose a tremendous
mount of money and it would be taken
rong But it wasnt taken wrong
hat happened Macys did much better
han they ever did before And thats
hat would happen to you The Desert
nn would do much much better because
ou would get Gimbles business and
he casino would be full

a

aX He tee

SHUSTER
Well Im not too familiar with
that picture but didnt Macys have
Santa Claus to help them out

(he starts to laugh)
I mean if they didnt have Santy

Claus there they might have done
very badly

He continues to laugh David now starts to laugh along
with him except Davids laugh has a pitiful ring to it
He senses this is not going to work

DAVID
Yes I guess they did have Santy
Claus Well thank you Thank you
And just so I understand we can t
get any of our money back right

SHUSTER
Well not today no But if the
policy ever changes well write
you

(still chuckling as

he goes back into

his office)
Thats wonderful Very good

He closes the door The desk Clerk who has just seen
Shuster laugh turns to David who is standing there
looking as bad as hes ever looked

CLERK
I think he likes you He rarely
laughs at anything

David just nods a sickly thank you

CUT TO

31 EXT MOTOR HOME - DAY

David and Nancy are driving They are well outside of
Las Vegas Nancy is staring out of the window David

is driving in silence Obviously they have been driving
for a great deal of time without saying anything Nancy
finally breaks the silence

32 INT MOTOR HOME
NANCY

I cant take this Say something
Yell at me Hit me Drive off
the road Do anything Just stop
being so silent

DAVID
I have nothing to say

NANCY
I cant keep apologizing Im
sorry Im sorry Im sorry

I feel horrible I would do
anything to change it

David says nothing He just clears his throat

NANCY

(continuing)
Youre going to make yourself
sick Its unnatural I

understand If I were you Id
be furious Dont hold it in

Go ahead

DAVID

(looking at her)
Im fine

More silent driving Nancy is desperately uncomfort-
able Obviously David is not fine How could he be
Hes seen ten years of earnings dissipate in less than
three hours and he didnt participate in any of the
dissipation After a while Nancy tries a new approach

NANCY
Obviously I cant apologize anymore
for what I did so we should talk
about what were going to do

DAVID
And what would that be

NANCY
Well our dream is still the same
We just dont have any money

David clears his throat again
NANCY

(continuing)
And also we should stop saying
we dont have any money We do
have some

DAVID

(very patiently)
We have eight hundred and two
dollars

NANCY
Thats something

DAVID
It is something Yes

NANCY
Well look I think we should
try to make the rest of the day
as pleasant as we can Since
were heading towards Hoover Dam
anyway we should make that our
destination for today We can
go there look around maybe
have a picnic or something and
maybe just see the dam and just
have a nice day outside What
do you think

DAVID
(staring straight
ahead speaking
in a monotone)

Is that what youd like

NANCY
Maybe it would be fun

DAVID

(still staring

still speaking

in a monotone)
Fine Hoover Dam

CUT TO

33 EXT HOOVER DAM - DAY

There are people walking around tours going on and
children playing The motor home pulls up They park
Nancy gets out with a bounce in her step hoping David
might copy her David gets out like Frankenstein
walking very slowly with no expression

NANCY
Look at this Come here God
Just think Men built this

DAVID
(still with no
expression)

Yes Men did build this

NANCY
What about something to eat
Hungry

DAVID
No

NANCY
Im starved

DAVID
I dont think you can eat now

NANCY
Why

DAVID
Because with the little bit of
money that we have left I think
we have to sit down and make up
a new budget Until we do maybe
we shouldnt spend it all on
cotton candy and other various
knickknacks here at the dam

Nancy is beginning to get irritated and frustrated that
he will not talk to her like an adult

NANCY
Well if thats your attitude
I think you should give me half
the money and let me eat whatever
I want and you can do what you
want with your half I think
thats the fair thing
DAVID

(the release of his

anger now begins)
The fair thing The fair thing
Thats it Youre right Ive
been controlled Boy have I
been controlled I guess any
doctor could have spotted it
I was about to die I was so
controlled You took all the
money we had

People can hear this echoing for miles around

DAVID

(continuing now

yelling)
You took our nest egg and you
broke it up You got yoke all
over the casino You got the
white all over the coffee shop
You threw the shells in the
parking lot Fair Fair
Where was I when you were
playing with the egg Sleeping
Sleeping Goddammit

NANCY
Good Get it out

DAVID
Shut up Dont talk to me like
Im an insane patient

NANCY
Lets just go back inside You
can yell at me You should I
think its right I just dont
want you to yell out here

DAVID

Out where This is where were
going to have to live Why not
yell out here Were going to have
to do everything else out here
Well be sleeping out here and
eating out here and going to the
bathroom out here Get used to
this cement baby This is it
Out here is it We found ourselves
We found ourselves alright We
found ourselves with eight hundred
dollars in the middle of nowhere

Nancy walks away She sees a crowd that is gathered
around and she does not want to have an argument in
front of these people David follows her

34 EXT SIDE OF ROAD - HOOVER DAM VISITOR AREA

DAVID
Where are you going

NANCY
I dont want to have an argument
in front of those people

DAVID
Why not I think those people
are entitled to know how stupid

you are

NANCY
This is going to turn into a
personal attack isnt it

DAVID
What else A general attack Who
am I going to attack Nevada I
cant attack the state It wasnt
their fault I cant attack the
motor home It stayed in the
parking lot I cant attack me
I was fast asleep By process
of elimination whos left

NANCY
Iam Im left okay And Ill
say it one more time - Im sorry

They are off by themselves now They have reasonable
privacy They are both very upset

DAVID
I dont want your apologies I
want to know why I want to try
to understand how it happened Tell
me How did it happen

NANCY
I couldnt sleep

DAVID

You couldnt sleep I see Now
I remember nights where I couldnt
sleep Im just trying to think
what I did Lets see I tried
warm milk or I took a long walk or
I took Nytol and then if all that
didnt work I gave away all the
money I ever earned But you
didnt try any of those things
first You just gave away the
money first right What did you
intend to do Have warm milk
afterwards Tell me Im mixed

up

NANCY
Youre not even listening

DAVID
Im sorry Youre right Go
ahead You couldnt sleep Then
what happened

NANCY
I dont remember I just went
downstairs

DAVID
Why didnt you wake me up

NANCY
What would you have done

DAVID
What would I have done I would
have followed you
I wouldve seen you I would have
watched you take your money and
begin to lose it and I would have
stopped you at thirty dollars
maybe thirty-two dollars at the
most I would have said
Sweetheart come back to bed
We dont want to fool with our
nest egg You know Nancy I
think you just considered nest

egg to be a term but to me it

was a key to this whole experiment
Why I considered it like a third
person It was our best friend
our guardian angel It was going
to allow us to do everything we
wanted to do It was going to
watch over us during bad times

and laugh with us during good times
It was going to help us roam and
purchase and eat and explore It
was going to help us make love

and laugh and cry and now its
gone and whos got it The Desert
Inn Theyve got our nest egg
They can sure use it cant they
hey dont have their own Theyre
poor little organization They
eed our nest egg Gee I hope
hey use it wisely I know someday
hose mirrors are going to have

o be reflocked and the red velvet
as looking kind of worn And
hose little heart beds are going
to need new sheets Im glad we
could help them pay for that Im
glad our life savings will go
towards making that room look a
little prettier Im glad we

gave it all to them Nancy Im
just going to miss the little nest
egg thats all Wont you
sweetheart Wont you miss the
nest egg In the middle of the
night wont you feel kind of
lonely because little nest egg

is paying for the gas in Frank
Sinatras limo

teat t aod

NANCY
Shut up David

(begins to cry shes

getting hysterical)
Shut up I dont want to hear nest
egg anymore I dont want to hear
that word Let me tell you something
Thats not the way you drop out
anyway If youre really going to
drop out you drop out with nothing

DAVID
You drop out with nothing Oh
where did you read that In the
Las Vegas Guide

NANCY
I didnt read that I know that

DAVID
Oh I see Who told you

NANCY
Friends people who know I dont
have to answer you

DAVID
No You dont have to answer me
You cant answer me because no one
ever told you that You never
had friends who dropped out You
dont know anybody who dropped
out except for us So how the
hell did you know that Come on
tell me

NANCY
Alright The movie youre basing
your whole life on Easy Rider
they dropped out with nothing
They had no nest egg

DAVID
Bullshit They had a huge nest
egg They sold cocaine They
didnt get on their motorcycles
till their nest egg was giant
fifty times the size of ours

NANCY
Thats not true

DAVID
Oh look Im not going to stand
here in front of one of the seven
wonders of the world and argue about
an old movie Im going to go now
and get back in the motor home and
maybe you can wander around out here
and figure out something to do We
have eight hundred dollars left and
an entire lifetime See what you
can come up with

David starts to walk away

NANCY
We could sell cocaine

DAVID

(stops and turns

around)
Well my God Why didnt I think
of that Great idea As a matter-
of-fact I remember after seeing
Midnight Express I went out of
the theater saying to myself Thats
for me Sex with hundreds of
Turkish men

David turns around and walks towards the motor home

DAVID
(continuing)
Come on Lets go

Nancy doesnt go with him

NANCY
No Forget it

DAVID

NANCY
You know Ill tell you one good
thing that came out of all of this
We forgot to get remarried That

DAVID
What are you saying

NANCY
Im saying that if we got remarried
it would be much more difficult to
get divorced Now its easy Its
over Ill just stay in Nevada for
six weeks and then well be legally
through This is how it should
have happened anyway David We
were stupid to think it could have
happened any other way

DAVID
Do you really believe that

NANCY
You bet your life I do I realize
now youre never going to let me
forget this For the rest of our
lives youll blame me and I wont
take it So goodbye Im sorry

39 EXT ROADSIDE RESTAURANT
By the time she gets outside David is already being

punched in the stomach and then in the face In be-
tween punches David is yelling to Nancy

NANCY
For rescuing me

thought about just forgetting it
and finding someone new but I
realized I had nothing to offer
them

NANCY
David listen to me Were going
to be alright

DAVID
I hope so Maybe we will

David starts the engine The home slowly begins to
move

NANCY
What do you think we should do
first

DAVID

First First I think we fill this
thing with gas so we can get as far
away as possible from that mental
patient Then I guess well head
east Well drive until we finda
place we both like and thatll be
our new home Well start there

and well begin to rebuild

NANCY
I swear to God I think this is a
blessing in disguise The whole
idea of going to Las Vegas was to
get remarried so we could have a
new beginning right Well that
wouldve just been a ceremony Now
we really are starting from the
beginning I think this way is
much better

DAVID
Well I hope it is But since we
really will never know the other
way lets not compare

NANCY
But after all the whole purpose
was to find ourselves and to be
free and now we really are free
The other way

DAVID

(interrupting)
Hold it honey Another comparison
right

NANCY

Well Im just excited I think
this is a blessing

DAVID
It very well might be All Im
saying is lets just let our
original plan rest in peace

DAVID
I dont think it had anything to

Obviously theyve had the best sex

NANCY
What was it The air

DAVID
Maybe My guess is extreme poverty

NANCY
Well then I say we should stay poor

DAVID
Look I was just guessing I think
we have to make some money we dont
want to starve to death and then find
out it really was the air Well
feel so stupid

NANCY

(smiles)
I have so much energy I cant
wait to get out and just explore
this city Im going to get a
great job I know it

David gets out of bed He puts on his robe

DAVID
Me too Now I think we should
have some kind of a plan What do

David approaches PHARMACIST

DAVID
Hello

PHARMACIST
Yes sir

DAVID

PHARMACIST
This is for your son

No for me

PHARMACIST
For you Well you have your own

No

PHARMACIST

Gee Im sorry but its a delivery
job You would need a car

DAVID
Well I have transportation I
own a motor home

PHARMACIST
A motor home

DAVID
Yes

PHARMACIST

I dont really think that would
suit this particular job I have
just a few small deliveries a

day Those things arent too
efficient and you probably wouldnt
be able to pay for gas with what
Id pay you

DAVID
Oh I didnt know Id have to pay
for my own gas

PHARMACIST
Yes Actually my intention was
to get a high school kid with a
Rabbit or something
I think an older man with a motor
home would be impractical for the
both of us You understand I dont
have that many deliveries Also
youd have trouble parking I
dont think this would work out

DAVID
I agree

PHARMACIST
You know what I should do I should
cross out man and put boy
delivery boy is more correct
I guess delivery man is misleading

DAVID
No the signs alright It looks
fine You dont know of any
immensely high-paying jobs in the
immediate area do you

PHARMACIST
Um let me think No not in the
immediate area

DAVID
What about in the outlying areas

PHARMACIST

paying jobs anywhere in the whole
country Do you

school

plus benefits

DAVID
Benefits meaning what

AGENT
Benefits meaning you can get a
ride to and from work if you need
it

DAVID
Well listen Ive just started
looking for work and I dont want
to rule anything out but I think
I probably can find something where
I can use my ability a bit more
Would you have another kind of
file like an executive box or
something

AGENT
What kind of box would that be

DAVID
You know a box of higher-paying
jobs

AGENT

My goodness I forgot Sure
You mean the hundred thousand
dollar box

Agent begins to laugh again

mind Its wonderful

NANCY
I told you this would all be a
blessing

DAVID
I know you did But now lets
talk facts Our nest egg broke
Forget who did it no blame

decision we ever made Because
for the first time we really know
how to share Whatever we have we
can enjoy it together

NANCY
But we dont have anything

DAVID

and the years we have left together
and the way were going about this
rebuilding program we will never
have another egg in our lifetime

NANCY
I was thinking the same thing

DAVID
