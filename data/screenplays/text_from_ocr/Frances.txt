PROLOGUE
BLACK We HEAR the soft voice of Frances Farmer

FRANCES (VO)
No one ever came up to me and said
Youre a fool There isnt such a
thing as God Somebodys been stuffing
you

FADE IN
EXT PUGET SOUND - DAY

On an expanse of water calm and undisturbed After a
moment

it begins to ripple as something rises toward the
surface A

girls face breaks through

FRANCES (VO)
It wasnt a murder I think God just
died of old age And when I realized
He wasnt any more it didnt shock
me It seemed natural and right

The girl FRANCES is 16 blond very pretty she seems
like

the most persuasive proof imaginable of Gods
existence She

swims toward the shore with long graceful strokes
then

climbs the steps of the old wood jetty on West Point
Beach

FRANCES (VO)
And yet I began to wonder what the
minister meant when he said God
the Father sees even the smallest
sparrow fall He watches over all
his children That jumbled it all

up for me
EXT PUGET SOUND - LATER
The banks of Puget Sound dotted with elm trees
sits comfortably in the fork of a tree writing in her
Towel around her neck her hair splayed out and drying
in the sun

FRANCES (VO)

But still sometimes I found that God

was useful to remember especially

when I lost things that were

important Please God let me find

my red hat with the blue trimmings
INT FARMER HOME - FAMILY ROOM - EVENING
Frances is now reading aloud from her diary gently
back and forth in a rocking chair An older woman

FARMER sits opposite on the couch listening and

from time to time A small suitcase stands by the front

FRANCES
It usually worked God became a
superfather that couldnt spank me
But if I wanted a thing badly enough
He arranged it

ERNEST FARMER appears in the doorway and hesitates
to his daughter read
FRANCES
But if God loved all of His children
equally why did He bother about my
red hat and let other people lose
their fathers and mothers for always
Ernest goes to Frances and kisses her softly on the top

her head She looks at him briefly smiling slightly

ERNEST
Bye baby
FRANCES
See you next weekend Dad

He goes to the door and picks up his suitcase glances

at
Lillian She doesnt look up He leaves

FRANCES
I began to see that He didnt have
much to do about hats or people dying
or anything They happened whether
He wanted them to or not and He
stayed in Heaven and pretended not
to notice

DISSOLVE TO
INT AUDITORIUM - DAY

Frances stands at a podium Other STUDENTS and TEACHERS

sit
to either side of her on folding chairs Above the
proscenium
is engraved West Seattle High School Below that a
banner
hangs NATIONAL HIGH SCHOOL ESSAY COMPETITION 1931
FRANCES
I wondered a little why God was such
a useless thing It seemed a waste
of time to have Him After that He
became less and less until He was
nothingness
The AUDIENCE consists of parents students and local
dignitaries We SEE several shocked faces Lillian is
there
also smiling Seated next to her is a distinguished-
looking
woman ALMA STYLES Ernest sits on the other side of
the

auditorium looking a little worried

FRANCES
I felt rather proud that I had found
the truth myself without help from
anyone It puzzled me that other
people hadnt found out too God
was gone We had reached past Him
Why couldnt they see it It still

A stately man sitting next to her her husband JUDGE

A TITLE COMES ON SCREEN GODS IN HIS HEAVEN AND ALLS
WITH THE WORLD NOT SO SAYS YOUNG FRANCES FARMER

We realize weve been watching a newsreel We SEE the
SUPERINTENDENT presenting Frances with an award

ANNOUNCER
Seattle is in the news again as a
high school junior wins a national
competition and a hundred dollar
prize with an essay denying God

City Hall steps Judge Hillier and other BIGWIGS
heatedly to reporters

ANNOUNCER
This prompts civic officials to charge
that left-wing politicians are
encouraging atheism in the citys
schools Miss Frances Farmer was
unavailable for comment but her
mother Lillian --

Lillian stands in front of her wood frame house
small CROWD of reporters photographers and curious
neighbors

ANNOUNCER
Farmer a well-known local dietician
stepped to her daughters defense

LILLIAN

(emphatically)
Frances has not turned her back on
the Lord theyre just having a
momentary difference of opinion
What child hasnt questioned the
Lords mysteries in order to better
understand them To paraphrase Mr
Voltaire I may not agree with what
she says but Ill defend to the
death her right to say it Freedom
of speech unlike in the dark
countries to the east still lives
in America And in my home

Among the AUDIENCE in the cinema we SEE Frances and

INT COURTROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

CLOSE ON Judge Hillier in his robes identified by a

nameplate
on the bench
HILLIER
These are perilous times With the
economic collapse comes hopelessness
and desperation and people turn to
dangerous ideas --

is
empty
HILLIER
Those of us who represent law and
order must be vigilant Whos behind

Now we SEE who hes talking to Alma Styles the woman
who

sat with Lillian at the school auditorium

STYLES
Impossible As her attorney Ive
known her for years

HILLIER
What about the father hes a little
pink Maybe he wants to show our
schools in a bad light shift some
support to Kaminski and those jackals

STYLES
(shaking her head)
Hes no influence he doesnt even
live at home No I think Frances
wrote that essay with no mischief
intended It was her teacher who
entered it in the competition

HILLIER
Well the publicity must stop Its
no good for Seattle and no good for
the country
(sternly)
Keep an eye on this will you Alma

STYLES
Of course your honor

He nods with satisfaction Two right-thinking people
fighting
for what they believe in

the

bread between the check and her father

ERNEST

Odets nods very slightly

INT DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

Frances sits in the cramped room listening intently to
Clurman Occasionally she sneaks a glance at Odets who

pacing like some caged beast

CLURMAN
The Group is more than a theatre
company Its the embodiment of an
ideal Our approach allows the actor
to be an artist in the fullest sense
a creative individual and an
instrument of change You see --

FRANCES
(watching Odets)
Really Mr Clurman you dont have
to sell me

CLURMAN
Forgive my indulgence Seems we always
lecture those who are on time for
those who are tardy The point is
Mr Odets here has written a wonderful
play Most of the roles are cast
but we havent found our female
lead

FRANCES
Who is she

ODETS
Shes a tramp from Newark

CLURMAN
Forgive me but I think youd be
perfect for the part

Odets is pacing furiously seizing their attention He
stops
looks at her then resumes

ODETS
Miss Farmer for me this is not a
play its an assaulta
seduction a plea for understanding
I think we live in a time when new
art works should shoot bullets
and you make very attractive
ammunition

He stops Tentatively almost boyishly he smiles
She returns it Shes charmed

And whats the title of this seduc
assault

you here but its still a fight a
struggle Being true to your art
being honest is always a struggle
We now HEAR Clurmans speech The initial words below
were
background to the above What we HEAR now is
underlined

CLURMAN

-Not only an artist but an
instrument of change We must look
to the world around us not content
to observe but to take an active
hand in redressing its wrongs We
will not stand idly by as Fascist
bombs obliterate democracy We
contribute our profits for if fascism
is not stopped in Spain it will
spread across Europe jeopardizing
the struggle of civilized man to
survive

SYMINGTON (early 30s glasses white coat and

smile) enters He holds his right hand out to Frances
MAN
Good afternoon Miss Farmer Im Dr
Symington
Frances stares at the proffered hand Lillian steps in

and takes it

He smiles pleasantly Lillian is obviously very put off
the idea She looks at Frances who stares unseeingly

LILLIAN
Oh Well I have some background
that you should probably know about

She goes out and down the hall The Doctor closes the

SYMINGTON
I find these initial meetings to be
much easier without the concerned
relatives in attendance

FRANCES
Am I supposed to say thank you

SYMINGTON
Thanks are hardly necessary

FRANCES
Aw shucks maam Twerent nothin

SYMINGTON
Im glad to see you havent lost
your sense of humor

FRANCES
It aint for lack of trying

SYMINGTON
So it seems May we be serious for a
moment

FRANCES
(seductively)
Why Doctor Weve only just met

He reddens ever so slightly and looks away

SYMINGTON
I feel Ive known you for a long
time you see Ive followed your
career youre a fascinating case

Im looking forward to resolving
your predicament

Frances face begins to set in hard planes

FRANCES
Oh Are you really

SYMINGTON
Among persons such as yourself
creative people under great stress
erratic behavior is not at all
uncommon and certainly nothing to be
ashamed of Its just that the
neuroses which fuel your talent can
also generate certain character
disabilities which

(can cripple your

ability to function)

He stops as Frances rises and leans over his desk

FRANCES
Do you expect me for one moment to
believe you have greater insight
into my personality than I do

SYMINGTON
Please sit down

FRANCES

You may discuss my predicament
Doctor You may discuss it with anyone
you like but not with me Im not
interested I can solve my problems
without recourse to a veternarian

SYMINGTON
I see

FRANCES
Besides I dont want to be what you
want to make me

SYMINGTON
And whats that

FRANCES
Normal Average

SYMINGTON
All right Will you please sit down

(smiling)

Symington says

FRANCES
Did you really say that

SYMINGTON
Just a little joke Miss Farmer

FRANCES
This whole thing is a joke
SYMINGTON
Stay calm please

FRANCES

No you stay calm Doctor But youre
finding that difficult arent you

(soft seductive)
Why are you attracted to me Perhaps
later in some of our more intimate
sessions after we know each other
a little better

(turning harder)
and youve torn my personality to
shreds and Im weeping and
vulnerable

(very hard)
then youll really get your kicks
wont you Doctor

SYMINGTON
Ill have someone show you to your
room

FRANCES

Oh thats good very professional
In control But the tiny beads of
sweat on your upper lip give you
away

Symington stares at her With a careful almost

scientific
gesture he moves thumb and forefinger over his lip
then
rubs the two fingers together Yes there is sweat
SYMINGTON
You really should get some rest now

INT SYMINGTONS OFFICE - DAY

Frances is alone in the room The door is ajar Shes
standing

over Symingtons desk which is empty except for a
doodle

pad The doodle shes looking at is extremely bizarre

sadistic After a moment Symington ENTERS holding
several

folders Frances manner changes very subtly

SYMINGTON
Im sorry to keep you waiting
the staff review ran over Did you
enjoy your mothers visit

FRANCES
(sitting)

Yes It was very good to see her

SYMINGTON
Really Any problems

Symington puts the folders in a drawer All except
Frances

FRANCES
Not at all She brought me my fan
mail

(a performance)
I had no idea there were so many
strangers concerned about me But I
guess thats the best thing about
working in the movies You make so
many friends I want to go back and
show them that the faith they put in
me wasnt a mistake

SYMINGTON
Youre telling me you feel guilty

FRANCES
(slightly edgy)
No What I mean is Im just
very excited by the prospect of
getting on with my life thats all

SYMINGTON
(after a pause)
Do you really believe your mothers
trying to kill you

FRANCES
(laughing)
What

SYMINGTON
She told me you said Mama you
want to kill me

FRANCES
I never said Oh look Thats just
a figure of speech She said something
funny and I said

SYMINGTON
And you accused her of tampering
with your mail

FRANCES
Oh for Christs

Frances is wrapping and unwrapping a handkerchief
around her

knuckles Looks a little crazy Symingtons watching
it She

stops

FRANCES
Im sorry She misunderstood thats
all

SYMINGTON
But you tell me you had a pleasant
visit and your mother says you were
sullen and uncommunicative Whom do
you think I should believe

FRANCES
Doctor I hate to break this to you
but my mother is a little batty

SYMINGTON
Frances youre still filled with
anxiety You feel guilty and hostile
toward your family and friends
Consequently I didnt recommend
your release at the staff review

FRANCES
You what

SYMINGTON
Mental illness is an elusive thing
and though Im pleased youre feeling
more capable its perhaps
unrealistic to expect you to be
completely cured after so short a
time Dont you agree

Frances stares at him Stunned Horrified

SYMINGTON
(smiling)
Im sure youll see it my way in the
end
FRANCES

Dr Symington how big is your dick

SYMINGTON
Huh

FRANCES
Cause if its long enough which I

doubt why dont you wrap it around
and fuck yourself in the ass

Symington smiles patronizingly

FRANCES
I want outta here you understand
Im ready to get out So you go back
there you go back and you tell
them to let me out

SYMINGTON
(calmly)
Frances Im warning you

FRANCES

No Im warning you Who do you think

Doyle fills in a line on the printed form before him

DOYLE
And you feel youre unable to control
her any longer

LILLIAN
No I mean yes Doctor

Alma holds up Lillians bruised wrists as evidence

And the only course open to you is
to commit your daughter for a period
of time to a mental institution

Hillier nods slightly approvingly toward Alma

DOYLE

Oh yes

From her history its apparent
the patient suffers from a paranoid
reaction with pronounced egotism
Her violent responses have recently
included aggression against her

mother In view of the deep-

seated

nature of her ailments and her failure

to respond satisfactorily to

shock it is my opinion she may

ultimately require permanent
institutional care

The whole hall joins in The Nurses make no effort to

to her feet When they succeed the hall breaks into
and a new chaotic chant

CHANT
We want Frances We want Frances

The chant is quickly silenced by hushing sounds
watching Frances She climbs up on her bench Her eyes
glazed her face expressionless This feels like some
of automatic behavior She takes an exaggerated posture
speaks in almost a whisper

INT STEILACOOM - VIOLENT WARD - NIGHT

The ward is a huge room packed with nearly naked women
hair cropped very short The walls are corrugated tin
to bare wood framing The place looks like an enormous

shed The SOUND OF GARBLED VOICES and SCREAMING never

their prone bodies shoved out of the way Some women
involved in violent sex with themselves or each other
in mindless fist-fights In a far corner we SEE a group
men in various military and medical uniforms their

us facing the wall grouped around something We HEAR
cheering and laughing and joking slapping each other
back
We SLOWLY MOVE CLOSER and can see over their shoulders

object of their hilarity Its Frances lying naked and

eagled on the floor Four hospital ATTENDANTS pin her
and legs A SOLDIER his pants down around his ankles
squirming violently on top of her Frances eyes are
but glazed her face turned away from her attacker She
passive and unresisting She is reciting to herself

THE HALL
Past other patients doctors etc We see some of this
from
her point of view
She goes through two swinging doors down another
hall at

the end of which a man opens a door She is pushed onto
STAGE

She is wheeled into a row between two other
patients In
the background we HEAR a voice

DR HARLINGTON (0S)
One merely inserts the leucotome
beneath the eyelid and presses up
into the prefrontal lobe manipulating
it so as to sever the nervous
connections between the thalamofrontal
radiation and the body of the brain

The lights are bright on her and the other patients
We

cannot see but we sense an audience watching

DR HARLINGTON (0S)
Because of the speed and simplicity
of the operation I am able as you
are seeing to perform the procedure
on ten patients in less than a half
hour

Frances stares up at a fan in the ceiling Its moving
round
and round The voice drones on

DR HARLINGTON (0S)
The operation is completely painless
and can be performed without any
sedative whatsoever

We now see vaguely that DR HARLINGTON has moved to the
patient on the adjacent gurney

DR HARLINGTON
We have always known that this form
of radical treatment was effective
but until now it couldnt be applied
on a large scale The old procedure
required a full days work by a
surgical team to perform a single
operation In the same time working
alone I can treat fifty

Frances turns and stares mutely without emotion at
whats

happening next to her the leucotome (an ice-pick-like

after all it is their emotions and

We glimpse the leucotome being withdrawn
DR HARLINGTON

Harlingtons face moves vaguely into Frances view

DR HARLINGTON

The show is This Is Your Life We SEE a smiling RALPH
EDWARDS reading from a large black book Next to him

handsome woman She seems uncomfortable

EDWARDS
Dwayne Steele divorced you and
from this point on your story takes
a darker turn Shunned by the
Hollywood you criticized so harshly
alienated from your family and
friends you turn your back on
professional commitments in New York
and alcohol and drugs enter your
life These are sad desperate times
for you

Throughout this Frances jaw works slowly back and
not from anger but in embarrassment and doubt

EDWARDS
until finally your mother finds
it necessary to commit you to a state
mental institution Were you mentally
ill Frances

FRANCES
-No Ralph I dont believe I ever
was sick But when youre treated
like a patient long enough youre
apt to act like one
We MOVE AWAY from the screen to see that the TV set is

in
the living room of a comfortable tastefully furnished
home
On the couch in front of the set sits Harry York He
still
looks athletic young for his age Tears stream down
his
cheeks

very little light of recognition in Frances eyes

relaxes
and becomes lucid

FRANCES

Beat
She takes his hand as if to shake it
Harry clasps hers tenderly

She holds on like an old woman stroking his hand For
an

instant she gets lost in time just holding his hand
Then

she looks up

FRANCES
Its going to be slow from now on
Do you know what I mean Harry

HARRY

FRANCES
Very slow
(uncertainly)
But were not going to stop are we

HARRY

FRANCES

It is as if she is able to express in words the last
remnant

of her indomitable will but the words bear no
emotional
power

FRANCES
Goodbye Harry It was very good to
see you again

HARRY
Yes Would you like me to walk a
little way with you

FRANCES
That would be okay

HARRY
Just a little way

He offers his arm She takes it All rather formal
