ESTABLISHING SHOT

EXT APARTMENT COMPLEX - MORNING

We reveal a nondescript apartment complex in North Hollywood
California It is not nice or ugly It looks like every
other pleasant-looking apartment complex in the valley

INT APARTMENT - MORNING

ANDY STITZER a boyish looking forty year old man is asleep
His clock radio goes off It is playing oldies which now
consists of rock ‘n’ roll from the mid eighties

MUSIC UP “Heat Of the Moment” by Asia

Andy sits up in bed Not happy not unhappy just another
day

INT LIVING ROOM - MORNING

Andy is doing his morning workout He is doing bench
presses He lifts an enormous amount of weight His face is
very kind and vulnerable almost emotionless but his body
is ripped

On a book shelf Andy has an impressive array of action
figures and comic books all in their original packaging
None of his vintage toys have been opened

EXT APARTMENT BUILDING - MORNING

Andy steps out of his apartment and unlocks his bicycle His
neighbors JOE and SARA in their mid-eighties wave to him
as he pedals off

EXT STREET - MORNING

Andy dressed in khaki slacks and a white dress shirt rides
his bicycle to work

ESTABLISHING SHOT

EXT CIRCUIT CITY - MORNING

Andy rides his bike into the parking lot of a mini-mall The
mini-mall consists of a dozen stores on two stories
There is a Barnes and Noble book store a Daily Grill
restaurant a nail salon a childrens gym and a video store
but the centerpiece is an enormous Circuit City

INT CIRCUIT CITY

Andy walks inside He says hello to people as he heads
toward the stock room Everyone politely says hello back but
it is clear he has no close relationships here

He takes his place at a desk which is in an opening between
the showroom and the stock room People come to him with

their receipts to get their items pulled from the stock room
and delivered to their cars

INT CURCUIT CITY - LATER

Andy is stamping a female CUSTOMER’S receipt PUNJAB an
Indian salesman is standing nearby

PUNJAB
It has been an honor doing business
with you Enjoy your new
“television Watch River Runs
Through It it looks amazing on
this thing

ANDY
Cal will you please help this woman
bring her stereo to her car

CAL a pudgy twenty two year-old white man walks out of the
stock room

CAL
(not meaning it)
Id love to

He picks up the customer’s television and walks with the
woman to her car

INT CIRCUIT CITY

Andy is walking across the showroom floor headed for the
bathroom He is stopped by JAY a tall handsome 25 year-old
salesman who is working a 40 year-old black female customer
JAY
Andy knows all about this stuff
What is the main reason a flat-
screen is better than a rear-
projection

ANDY
The viewing angle is far better on
a flat-screen Due to the liquid
crystal display you can watch it
from any part of the room and its
a much better resolution

JAY
So sure youll save a couple bucks
with rear-projection but you have
more than two people over they’re
gonna have to sit on your lap to
watch TV But maybe you like that

The woman laughs

Andy keeps walking A very attractive young woman steps
his path He looks terrified

ATTRACTIVE WOMAN
Could you help me

ANDY
No

ATTRACTIVE WOMAN

ANDY
Yes Im not a salesman TI stamp
invoices

ATTRACTIVE WOMAN

CD players

BACK TO SCENE

ANDY
What am I missing

DAVID
I don’t know You’re not just
missing out on sex you’re missing
out on relationships How often do
you even leave your apartment
What about friends and love and
taking chances And most of all
youre missing out on sex What
are you crazy that’s the best
thing on earth You can’t live
your entire life and not experience
that Hiding from that is shutting’
you down from everything else

ANDY
You know weve been working

think this is the first time weve
ever had a conversation that lasted
longer than fifteen seconds

Come out with us tonight No
pressure We‘ll just have some
fun

ANDY

I don’t want to have sex with
anyone tonight

DAVID
Don’t worry You wont have sex
with anyone tonight

EXT CITY STREET - DAY

Andy is walking home Everything he sees seems sexual It
is as if he has seen all of this for his entire life but
never noticed it before

He sees-

A normal looking middle aged WOMAN walking down the street
He looks away as if she is pure sex

A gorgeous eighteen year old GIRL with no bra and a low cut T-
shirt

He turns away and tries to hide at a newsstand He looks
down

QUICK CUTS--every cover is of a gorgeous busty woman

He walks away and stops at a bus stop just wanting to get
home The bus pulls up and on the side of it is a billboard
of a perfume ad with a naked man and a naked woman We only
see their bodies no faces It could not be dirtier

Andy panics and starts running down the street As he runs
the bus pulls out and is driving at the same rate of speed as
Andy He can not escape this dirty billboard no matter how
fast he runs Finally the bus stops at the next light and he
loses it but immediately a new bus drives parallel to him
with an even dirtier billboard of a couple bodies naked and
intertwined clearly doing something he’s never done

Andy cuts right and starts running through a neighborhood -
He cuts through houses and lawns He sees two DOGS having
furious sex on a lawn He cuts into the woods and runs and
runs

INT ANDY’‘S APARTMENT

Andy runs in and closes the door He lies down on his bed and
turns on the TV He channel surfs Every commercial and
program has something filthy on it

-A soap opera with people kissing
-A commercial for Viagra
-Paris Hilton almost naked on Entertainment Tonight

-Teenagers making out on MTV

-A dirty rap video with tons of barely dressed women and a
ripped rapper

He shuts the TV and closes his eyes as tightly as humanly
possible

Suddenly we hear the sounds of his elderly neighbors
laughing then having very loud sex The wall behind Andy

bangs and shakes Then stops Then bangs and shakes even
louder

Andy runs into the bathroom

INT BATHROOM CONTINUOUS

Andy turns on the water flushes the toilet puts his fingers
in his ears and closes his eyes

ANDY
(to himself)
Everything’s gonna be ok
Everything is gonna be ok

to join in on the fun

She turns to ask the question and runs through a red light
Two cars narrowly avoid a crash

ANDY is quickly appreciating the danger of this situation

ANDY
(reaction to near miss)
Oh God Yes Crap

NICKY
Look at me Youre not looking at

NICKY is looking at ANDY Her eyes dont even glance at the
road ANDY’s eyes are glued to the road filled with abject

terror

NICKY
(screaming)
LOOK AT ME

ANDY
(screaming)
YOURE PRETTY YOURE SO PRETTY I

NICKY

ANDY looks puzzled

NICKY

NICKY forcefully pulls him to her

ANDY is now practically sitting on NICKY’S lap He looks down
the road she looks at him

NICKY

She pauses to vomit a little in her mouth

NICKY

NICKY kisses him

ANDY
Maybe I should drive

NICKY

You don’t know where I live

ANDY
You could tell me

NICKY

NICKY begins tonguing ANDY’S ear

ANDY
(laughing)
That tickles

ANDY is now trying to help NICKY steer the car

She is giggling while tonguing he alternates between
laughter and paralyzing fear as the car narrowly avoids
striking pedestrians other cars trees etc

Finally NICKY looks up

NICKY
(casually)
Oh this is me

NICKY pulls the steering wheel hard and the car does a
complete 360 and comes screeching to a halt between two
parked cars in front of a nondescript apartment building

NICKY
Were here

NICKY looks deep into ANDY’s eyes
NICKY
My Moms staying over tonight so

NICKY starts to take off her shirt

ANDY
Maybe I should be moseying home

NICKY starts to cry She then abruptly begins to laugh Then
she vomits on ANDY

NICKY
I am so sorry I think I ate some
bad shellfish sandwich

NICKY continues to take off her clothes and kiss Andy
NICKY
Hurry up then we can get

ANDY is clearly repulsed and traumatized

ANDY
I really need to get going

We see that NICKY has vomit on her cheek

NICKY

NICKY

NICKY puts the car in drive and smashes into the parked car
three feet in front The second car hits a fire hydrant which

then blasts water through the open window of a nearby
apartment

NICKY

sounds like a gang fight is about to explode The camera

pans across the faces and finally finds Andy looking
terrified and slightly bruised

INT CIRCUIT CITY - MORNING

Andy is in a rage as he complains to David Jay and Cal--who

JAY
We didn’t tell you to switch seats
with her when the cops came

ANDY
I was trying to be a gentleman

DAVID

Having sex
(normal voice)
That I didn’t use my brain

CAL
Sounds like you didn’t use anything
else Did anything eventful
happen

ANDY
She threw up on me

They explode with laughter

ANDY

MONTAGE OF ANDY GETTING A MAKEOVER

INT HAIR SALON DAY

Andy is getting a haircut When he looks at his haircut it
igs meant to be short and a little European but the coolness
of the haircut makes him look silly The guys look at it and
smile Andy looks happy with it

INT HAIR WAXING STATION - DAY

Andy lays on his stomach on a table A WOMAN pours hot wax
on his back lets it dry for a moment then RIPS it off -
leaving a huge strip of whiter-than-white skin in the middle
of his hairy back

QUICK CUTS

She strips off several more hunks of hair from his back and
chest

We see tears of pain coming down Andys face This could
not hurt more

Finally Andy red faced and miserable stops her as she is
about to pull off a huge strip

He gets up and starts putting on his shirt only two thirds
of his body hair has been removed and he looks insane

EXT ALL STAR SPORTS BAR - PARKING LOT

Andy Jay Cal and David are walking from their cars to the
restaurant There is a huge banner hanging on the building
which says “WELCOME SPEED DATERS”

ANDY
Speed dating I don’t know

JAY
Its just like regular dating but
you eliminate all of the fat The
talking and the waiting for the
lights to come on to see if she’s
good looking

DAVID
You get two minutes with each girl
You meet twenty girls in forty five
minutes It would take you a year
to meet that many women

CAL
More like a decade

He laughs and lifts his hand for a high five Nobody high
fives him

CAL
That wasn’t so bad

ANDY
Im scared I dont do well under
pressure

JAY
dust do what I told you to do Ask
them questions Put them on the
spot

JAY (contd)

You have a better chance of getting
them to like you if they are
feeling awkward and insecure about
themselves

CAL
All I need is for one girl in
twenty to dig me I can work with
these odds

DAVID
When it’s over you tell them which
girls you like they tell you if
any of those girls want to get to
know you better And if there are
any matches you guys exchange phone
numbers Or emails I’m not sure

ANDY
Do you think this will work

desperate so we are in luck

ANDY
Andyis my name
cuT To

INT CIRCUIT CITY - LATER
Andy is nervously helping Trish

ANDY
You don’t want this VCR

TRISH
Really I heard this was the best
one

ANDY

It’s not really VCR technology
is very simple Basically no VCR
is that much better than another
VCR The expensive ones don’t give
you a better picture they just
look cooler and have more buttons
which you would never use

Andy points out a standard looking VCR

ANDY
This one has the features you need
and it is a third less than the
cool-looking one Unless you
really want a cool-looking one
Then you should get this one
‘Cause it does look cool Its
black Has a lot of lights

TRISH
Looks are not a factor

ANDY
Great Then we have found what you
need

The old man that Andy was helping previously walks over to
Andy

OLD MAN
Excuse mé Is there anyone who can
help me set up what I bought

OLD MAN (cont d)

I am not very technically minded
And quite frankly I can barely see
my own hand

ANDY
Where do you live

OLD MAN
Right down the street on Moorepark

ANDY
I can swing by on my way home from
work and set it all up if you like

OLD MAN
How much would that cost me

ANDY
Nothing It would be my pleasure
I would enjoy it

OLD MAN
Thats very kind of you

ANDY
Youre doing me the favor I like
hooking up TVs and stereos It’s
like solving a big puzzle

OLD MAN
Thank you Maybe I could bring in
something for you to eat

ANDY
And maybe I will gladly eat it
Just give your address to the man
at the stock room

The old man walks off Trish looks at Andy Andy looks at
Trish She stares at him for a moment trying to figure him
out She likes something about him As she figures out what
to do about it Andy gets nervous

ANDY
Well have a good day

TRISH
Andy It’s Andy right

ANDY
Last time I checked

TRISH
Do you want to go out some time

ANDY
(nervous laughter)

TRISH

worry I’m not going to ask you to
set up my VCR

JAY
Her Oh man you hit the jackpot

and she is ready to go

ANDY
Now I don’t want to go out with
her

JAY

one kiss

ANDY
Oh okay

When Andy looks the other way Jay gestures with his hips that
he had sex with Trish When Andy turns back he stops

JAY
Good for you man This is good

INT RESTAURANT - NIGHT
Andy and Trish are eating dinner

TRISH
That’s so funny that we work in the
same mini mall and we have never
seen each other

ANDY
I’ve seen you I eat at the
restaurant you work at on Mondays

TRISH
Really Every Monday
ANDY
Yeah I would eat there more I
just don’t want to get sick of it

TRISH
Have I ever waited on you

ANDY
Maybe a couple of times

It is clearly way more than a couple of times

TRISH
How long have you worked at Circuit
City

ANDY
Nine years

TRISH

Wow Do you like it
ANDY

Not really But it’s a good job
TRISH

“What would you like to be doing

ANDY

toys I would like to open a

things Maybe some comic books
I don’t know if I‘ll ever be able
to do it

TRISH

anything

ANDY

drained out of me

ANDY
That’s not true

TRISH
I just want to be happy I don‘t
care what I do I just don’t want
it to be too hard Less hours I
guess what I am saying is I want to
retire

Andy laughs

TRISH
(sweetly)
What is with you

ANDY
What

TRISH
There is something about you I
can’t tell what it is

ANDY
Is it bad

TRISH
I think it’s good But I don’t

TRISH
Good

INT TRISHS APARTMENT - DAY
Andy and Trish walk in the apartment

TRISH
Can I get you a cocktail

ANDY
Sure Do you have orange soda
It’s okay if you dont Most
people don’t buy orange soda on a
regular basis I don’t know why
It’s really good

Out of the blue she kisses him hard on the mouth The kiss
lasts a long time At first he doesn’t know what to do but
after about ten seconds he actually participates

When she stops kissing and looks at him he could not be
redder He is stunned but there is happiness in there

TRISH
Let’s go in the other room

INT BEDROOM MOMENTS LATER

Trish jumps under the covers She pulls off her shirt then
reaches under the sheets and removes her pants and underwear

TRISH
Come on

ANDY
Oh Okay

Andy gets under the covers with all his clothes on and kisses
Trish who is now completely nude He seems to be getting
the hang of it There is a lot of pent-up energy there

TRISH
Wow you really like kissing

ANDY
I do
TRISH
Take off your clothes
ANDY
Really
TRISH

Is this too fast I never do this

ANDY
No

Andy takes his pants off but strangely leaves on his shirt
Probably to cover his bad wax job

Trish shuts the lights They kiss passionately She takes
off his shirt

TRISH
Do you have protection

ANDY
I dont like guns

She laughs

TRISH
You have a silly sense of humor
Dont worry I think I have
something

She reaches into the drawer in the end table and pulls out a
small whicker basket filled with condoms She clearly has

sex often enough to need this basket Andy does net pick up
on this

TRISH
Put one of these on

Andy stares at the basket not sure what to do He has never
worn a condom He slowly takes one out He reaches under
the sheets and we cant see what he is doing but it is

obvious that he is tearing the wrapper open and attempting to
put the condom on

Something goes wrong He struggles

ANDY
It tore I need another one

He grabs another one The same thing happens For reasons
which are not clear he can not figure out how to get this
condom on properly

Andy attempts this many more times In quick cuts we see him
struggle with at least a dozen condoms as he gets more and
more frustrated with this process Each time he fails he
tosses the condom and the wrapper on the floor next to him

Finally he gets one on

ANDY
There you go Sorry about that I
always have trouble with those
things I haven’t used ‘em much
(beat)
My last girlfriend took pills

TRISH
T’m sure it will be worth the wait

Now they go at it more passionately It seems like it is
going to happen when--

THE DOOR OPENS - THE LIGHTS GO ON

MARLA
What is going on in here

We reveal Trish’s sixteen year old daughter MARLA Standing

next to her is her boyfriend MARK

TRISH
What are you doing

ANGLE ON
A stack of condoms and torn wrappers
ANGLE ON MARLA - STARING AT THEM

MARLA
What are you doing I can’t
believe you are allowed to have sex
but I’m not That is sooo
unfair

She slams the door and exits

ANDY
I should go

TRISH
No it’s okay I just need to talk
to her

ANDY

No I should

He kisses her then quickly gets out of bed and begins putting
his clothes on We see his insanely bad wax job has left

random strips of hair on his body He puts his clothes on
and exits

TRISH
Im sorry

ANDY
Dont be

He runs out Traumatized again

EXT STREET - DAY

Andy rides his bike to work He looks confused and consumed
Everywhere he looks he sees sexual images billboards people
walking down the street etc

He drives into the parking lot of the mini mall where Circuit
City is located As he is locking his bike he sees Beth

BETH

orgasm As she walks toward the bookstore where she works
she almost trips

TRISH
I was thinking if we go out any
more that we shouldn’t have sex

ANDY

I just think it complicates things
too much and then you never get to
really know someone because that is
always confusing things

ANDY
Its very confusing

TRISH
Does that bother you

ANDY
Hmmm Let me think about that I
see what you are saying Obviously

I want to
(whispers)
Do it

dont have sex we can really get
to know each other

TRISH
And if that works out then we can
have sex Like really have sex

TRISH
I’m so glad youre here I need
your help
ANDY
Sure What is it

TRISH
Can you take Marla to Planned
Parenthood She wants to go on the
pill

ANDY
Me

TRISH
Her father is dead set against it
Iam too But I thought maybe you
could bring her down there just to
get some information Maybe we
could delay her for a little bit
while we figure out what to do

ANDY
Isnt she a little young to go on
the pill

TRISH
Shes sixteen And she wont
listen to me I told her she
should wait till shes much older
to have sex but it’s hard for me
to say that when I had a kid at
seventeen So I thought maybe she
would listen to you

ANDY
I don’t know if I am the right
person to do this

TRISH
Yes you are She has no issues
with you She likes you Gosh
this was so much easier when we
were young

ANDY
Yeah

TRISH
When we were kids you just did it
It was fun It was no big deal
There weren’t all these horrible
diseases Now the whole thing is
terrifying

ANDY
Truly terrifying
(beat)
Not like when we were young

TRISH
I lost my virginity at fourteen

ANDY
Me too Fourteen years old So
young So very young

TRISH

INT CAR DAY
Andy is driving a sullen-looking Marla to Planned Parenthood

MARLA
This is so gross

ANDY
What
MARLA
You taking me here

ANDY
I don’t mean it to be gross Your
mother thought you needed someone
to talk to

MARLA
Andy you’re a nice guy but youre
practically a stranger I don’t
want to talk about sex with you

ANDY
Either do I I know it’s
embarrassing but you need to
inform yourself 2 think that is
very important before you make a
life-changing decision ‘Cause
once you have sex there is no
turning back You will never he
the same again and what if you
want to go back But you can’t
There are no time machines The
pandora’s box will be open

MARLA
Okay I get it Stop trying to
freak me out T’11 listen

INT PLANNED PARENTHOOD DAY
Andy and Marla sit across from JUDITH a counselor

JUDITH
Coming here was a very smart thing
to do A lot of young people act
without thinking Carefully
considering your options is a very
responsible way to act You should
be proud of yourself

MARLA
Would it be weird if I just asked
you for the pill right now

JUDITH
A sense of humor is an effective
weapon in high school Im sure it
serves you well

cUuT TO
B84

ANDY
I was trying to tell her that there
is no reason that she needs to
engage in sexual activity at such a
young age

JUDITH
That’s true Your virginity is a
gift A gift you shouldn’t be so
quick to give away

ANDY
I completely agree

JUDITH
There are plenty of activities you
can engage in without having sex
that can be fun and safe

ANDY
(interested)
What kind of activities I’m sure
shes interested in knowing

JUDITH
Well instead of having
intercourse you might want to try
eutercourse

MARLA
Outercurse Uch What’s that

ANDY
Yeah whats that

Andy is leaning forward in his chair way more interested
than Marla

JUDITH
Outercourse is anything that isn’t
vaginal intercourse It can be

just having fun in a non-sexual way
with your friend Or it can be
kissing

ANDY
Kissing is nice

JUDITH
And there are many ways to be
sexual without intercourse such
as body rubbing which you might
call “dry humping”
gs

ANDY
See you can do that

JUDITH
Masturbation mutual masturbation

ANDY
What’s that

JUDITH
Thats when you both masturbate at
the same time

ANDY
to Marla)
You could do that instead

JUDITH
Theres deep kissing erotic
massage oral sex play role-
playing and sharing fantasies with
a partner

ANDY
Go there are a lot of things you
can do instead of sex

JUDITH
It’s only limited by your
imagination

MARLA
I think I‘m gonna vomit

JUDITH
Thats very funny but this is
serious business Outercourse
offers nearly 100 percent
protection against pregnancy

ANDY
Thats a plus I didn’t know that

JUDITH
Outercourse can also greatly reduce
the risk of HIVAIDS and many other
sexually transmitted infections —
unless body fluids are exchanged
through oral or anal intercourse
But some infections like herpes
and HPV can be passed by skin-to-
skin contact
oe

ANDY
This is fantastic What would
someone do about performance
anxiety ‘Cause I am sure Marla
and her friend are worried that
their sex wont be satisfying and
then the unsatisfied partner might
fly into a rage and break it off
with the inadequate partner

JUDITH
Sex takes practice but there are
many techniques to extend the
amount of time that a man can
maintain his erection Including
visualization techniques and a
personal favorite of mine which is
called pinching What a woman does
is right when her man is about to
ejaculate she pinches his---

MARLA
Ive got to get out of here

ANDY
Marla

She runs out to the car

INT

ANDY
Can‘t you just let her finish
(to Judith)
Im sorry You have a lot of this
information on your web site

Andy is pushed out the door

INT ANDY’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Andy enters his apartment Jay is there packing up his
things

ANDY
What happened

JAY
Me and Jill are getting back
together She’s pregnant

ANDY
With your kid

JAY

Yeah with my kid That’s why she
broke up with me Because she
found out she was pregnant and she
didn’t know if I would be a good
dad in light of the fact that I
cheat on her all the time

ANDY
So this is good

JAY
It’s the best I love her sooo
much This was meant to happen I
was meant to be with her and to be
the father to this child I will
never screw around again J am so
lucky

ANDY
(sadly)
I am so happy for you

JAY
Did something happen

ANDY
I’m sorry I don’t mean to ruin
your good news Im just sad
‘cause Trish wants to have sex

JAY
Thats what you wanted

ANDY
No she really wants to have sex
Like right now What do I do If
she finds out I am a virgin she
wont like me anymore She will
think I am a loser

JAY
No she wont

ANDY
She will What kind of man doesn’t
have sex for forty years And I am
about to turn forty one If I turn
forty one without having sex
that’s really pathetic

JAY
Then don’t tell her Just have sex
with her Give it to her really
good

ANDY
I don’t know how to do that

JAY
You might get lucky You might be
good

ANDY
Really
JAY
Wellsince you have forty years

of sexual energy stored up there
is a chance that it might not last
very long

ANDY
This is what I was worried about
If I am honest she’ll think I am
defective If I have sex it will
be bad and she won’t want to be
with me I’‘i1 never get a second
chance
JAY
Hold on relax I am going to give
you some advice right now And I
want you to just take it because I
know what I am talking about I
took my girlfriend for granted I
didn’t appreciate her I didn’t
accept that she was the best person
could ever dream of And because
of that I almost lost her But
now that I have been honest with
her we are going to have a long
life together And a child

AMBRE)
So you think I should just tell her
everything

JAY
No I think you should get it on
with that girl Beth from the
bookstore Pay attention Learn
as much as you can then use that
knowledge with Trish

ANDY
That doesn’t sound ethical

JAY
What she likes you She wants
you You would be giving her
something she wants What’s
unethical about that You aren’t
asking her to marry you so you can
steal her fortune

ANDY
That makes sense

JAY
I think it is what Trish would
want

ANDY
Thank you Jay I know I have been
tough on you but without your
advice I wouldn’‘t have gotten this
far

JAY

Thanks That means a a lot to me
Now go get that girl

JAY (contd)
And when you’re done--go get your
girl and do her
