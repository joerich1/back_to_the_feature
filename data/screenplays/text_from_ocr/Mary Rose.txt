FADE IN

Our picture opens on a fairly distant shot of The Island
lonely sun-speckled yet mist-dim somehow unsubstantial
Slowly the CAMERA moves closer as a mans voice speaks
It is a Highlanders soft voice

CAMERON (0s)

Well there it iss The Island
A mossy bank a soft bit of sod
spot to rest your oars and sit
and sun yourself a spell Some-
how the sun does seem to favor
the place A toy islanda wee
insignificant bit of grass and
stoneas tranquil looking a
piece of real estate as anyone
could fancy Stop Stop here

THE CAMERA obeys

CAMERON (contd) (os)
Well go no closer Not again
Not efer again

(draws a deep breath)

- That
iss its name in Gaelic In
English it means The Island That
Likes to be Pisited

(his voice deeply ironic)
Fisited indeed There are those
who hafe found the island hos-
pitable to a fault There are
those who hafe found the island
hungry for fisitors

PADE OUT

PADE IN

LONG SHOT HIGH of a country house not really isolated

but somehow alienated from its neighbors It is run-down

neglected empty andeven in the light of mid-afternoon

Gark Over this scene we once more hear the 0S voice of
CAMERON

CAMERON (sighing)
Yesanother choice bit of real
estate But herethere is no
invitation here no beckoning

CAMERON (contd) (o8)
no wanting to be fisited And yet
this housethis house and the
Island are for all time linked
most tragically together

The voice fades as a jeep vintage World War II comes
down the road slowing down and finally stopping in front
of the house The CAMERA closes in and by the time the
back door opens and a man an American officer in battle
dress gets out of the car we are in MEDIUM CLOSE-UP
The man turns and faces the house as if confronting it
Bis eyes narrow speculatively as he slowly Geliberately
takes in the dark decay of the place the ‘FOR SALE sign
itself now old and forlornly awry on its base

At last the man moves across the weedy stretch of lawn
mounts the steps starts to knock changes his mind and
tries the door It opens easily and he steps into the
house closing the door gently behind him

He finds himself in a small entrance hall On either side
of him are closed-off rooms Before him is a staircase
curving gracefully upward A pale light dimly penetrates
the dirty fanlight above the door making it possible for
the manand for usto make out the gracious lines of
the architecture Even now in this sorry state one can
imagine how inviting how warm this small manor house
must once have been

Without haste the man takes in the sight the ambiance
But though unhurried he wastes no time for his interest
his focus of attention seems to be on the staircase and
on the unseen floor above

Slowly he begins to mount the stairs At the top he
discovers a door open upon a dark and deeply silent room
Quietly he enters All of this rooms past which can be
taken away has gone Such light as there isno more
than enough to make shadowscomes from the only window
which is at the back and incompletely shrouded in sacking
Also toward the back of the room is another door- It is
closed As his eyes adjust to the dark they circle the
room taking in the peeling wallpaper the desolated
deserted sadness of it all until finally his eyes come to
rest upon the only furnishings in the room Lf two up-
ended packing cases and a chair may be called furnishings

On top of one of the cases is an unlighted candle ina
holder and beside it is a chair the back of which is
turned toward the man These objects seem only to add

to the impression of empty desertion And then in the
dark the man becomes slowly conscious of the faintest
“almost indiscernible movement It is in the chair He
freezes There is a moment of utterly suspended animation
Then he speaks his voice hardly a whisper

KENNETH
Whos there

THE CAMERA closes in tight on the chair as from its
depth the movement takes shape and turns to face the man
In the chair is a woman old gaunt narrow-eyedas
frightened by the man as he has been by her Only when
her old gimlet eyes observe the obviously corporeal
Mature of the intruder does she let out her breath
Hostilely she regards him

MRS OTERY
What do you think youre up to
here now This heres private
property

KENNETH
(relaxes almost smiles)
And you must be the caretaker
Your name is

MRS OTERY
(compelled against
herself to answer
his gentle but
utterly assured
command)

(trying to regain

her authority)
Mrs Harry Otery thats who

prospective purchasers with

MRS OTERY
Im not one to waste good candle-

KENNETH
(cheerfully)
Right you are Mrs Otery
But I doent think Qqur common
cause will be fatally compromised
if we burn an inch or so of that
candle

He attempts to light candle but the wick has burned too
low He then removes a knife a rather large lethal-
looking instrument from inside his jacket and with it
begins to carve the wick out of the wax

of the knife)
‘Bre nowwhat aze you carrying

As you rightfully pointed out

light begins to look around the room The Light shows

By a stair containing some
superbly romantic rat-holes
(moves to window)
Theres an apple tree outside
there with one of its branches
scraping against the window
(smiles)
It was my own private entrance
and exit

He pulls aside the sacking which lets in a little mors
light We see that the window which reaches to the
floor opens outwards There is however no tree The
man stares in disappointment lets out his breath

KENNETH (contd)
Ah

MRS OTERY
Well there was a tree I
believe You can see the
root if you look down

KENNETH

(at the window)
Yes Yes I see it in the
long grass And a bit of the
seat that used to be around
it There were blue curtains
at the window and there was a
sofa at this end and I had my
first swimming lessons on it

You are a fortunate woman to
be here drinking in these
moving memories

When I inquired about it they
said the owners had to get a care-
taker from a distance because no

in this house

A pack of cowards

from another county was a pretty

Iwas finally released I was ad-

home in Switzerland where a woman

I barely recognized as my own

grandmother informed me that my

grandfather had suffered a stroke

and was dead that this house the

only home Id ever known was

closed and would be sold or rented

at which point a nurse came in and

said I was disturbing the patient

in the chair that MRS OTERY had Occupied He taps out
his pipe his eye first on the door then deliberately
turned toward the delicate movement of the little fingers
of dying fire As the fire burns lower he sits quietly
and in the increasing dusk he ceases to be an intruder
and his figure becames indistinct and fades from sight

When the haze lifts we are looking at the room as it was
some forty-five years ago on the serene afternoon that
began its troubled story There are rooms that are always
Cheerful and MRS MORLANDS little drawing-room is one of
them It is furnished as we have already heard with the
blue curtains the sofa on which KENNETH had his first
swimming lessons the Peacocks on the wil and the apple
tree is in full blossom at the Open window One of the
trees branches has even stepped into the room

MR MORLAND and the local Clergyman MR AMY are chatting
importantly about sane matter of no importance while MRS
MORLAND is on her sofa at the Other side of the room She
is knitting and she comes into the conversation occasionally
with a cough or a click of her needles This is her
tactful way of telling her husband not to be so assertive to
his guest All three people are slightly over forty years
of age They are People who have found life to be on the
whole an easy and happy adventure The squire is oly a
small squire of very moderate means who passes life pleasant-
ly and not unprofitably in being a JP and will discuss for
days or months the advisability of putting anew roof on a
tenants cowshed Eventually without his knowing it his
wife will make up his mind for him Even she does net know
she has done it MRS MORLAND is a delightful woman with
rather shrewder sense than her husband and she has a joxe
that has kept her Merry through all her married life viz
her husband She adores him however and they are an
extremely happy sociable couple MR AMY is even more
scciable than MR MORLAND he is reputed to know everyone

in the county and has several times fallen off his horse
because he will salute all Ppassere-by On his visits to
London he usually returns depressed use there are so
many people in the streets to whom he may not give a” friendly
bow He likes to read a book if he knows the residence of
relative of the author and at a play it is far more to
him to learn that the actress has three children one of
them down with measles than to follow her histrionic genius
He and his host have the pleasant habit of print-collecting
and a very common scene between them is that which now
follows They are bent over the squires latest purchase

one taken On KENNETHS second birthday But we must stay
with it long enough to take in the three candles on the
cake MRS MORLAND now occupying the place of the absent
MARY ROSE and somewhat apart unsmiling SIMON who is
looking not at the little boy on his birthday but into
some distance of his own The boy KENNETH is seen to
be fair and blue-eyed like his mother and he has something
of her open gaze and look of innocent joy This first
picture should be followed by several morefive or six
all on KENNETHS birthdays MRS MORLAND is always there
SIMON is sometimes not The pictures in which SIMON is
present should reveal the estrangesent between father and
son They are never touching never smiling at each
other always separated by some person or thing The last
shot should be dated 1914 and we should see SIMON in some
attitude indicating his role as warrior and KENNETHS envy
and eagerness to join the company of men Under the date
1915 there is no picture Instead in a firm hand should
be written the words ‘Private Kenneth Moreland Blake
Missing in Action’

Tnis time she is determined She darts from him and into
the house to the light In the foyer she stops her
attention caught at once by the electric light She besins
to tremble slightly controls herself then notices a
collection of prints that now hang in the foyer She
attempts a smile turns back toward the open door outside
which SIMON stands unebdle to bring himself to cross the
threshold into the revealing light

MARY ROSZ (contd)

SIMON does not move or answer and her voice goes quay-ry

MARY ROSE (contd)
Simon

And now slowly irrevocably poor SIMON steps into the light
His face teut with anxiety and strangely shame shows it-
self to her He nervous insistent smile is turned full on
him For a long moment her expression does not change at all
And then suddenly a little grimace that is almost a tic
repleces the smile Her reactions are small very emall as
they are when ones confidence in ones physical senses are
dangerously shaken Ones primary § instinct is not to
expose this terrifying failure Under SIMONS sad and silent
gaze MARY ROSE her young body as still as a stopped heart

‘forces her mouth slowly back into the lines that are meant

to delineate a smile

Iam sorry Mary Rose

She blinks and turns her head slightly to one side no
longer able to look directly at him A small shudder
runs through her She seems to become before our eyes a
oruel travesty of herself It ie not that she is any
Older but that her youth is now somehow determined
what was once vivacity is now nerves pulle ° t3
what was once ingenuous is now disingenuous

Where is everybody Deddy

She cashes furiously up the stairs and bursts into the
brightly lighted DRAWING-ROOM Her confrontation with

her white-feced trembling perents is no more then a
tearedimmed streak across the distance thet seperates

them She flings herseif into her mothers erms MRS
MORLAND beyond tears almost beyond feeling simply holds
with a mothers reflexes this memory of a girl

MARY ROSE
Oh mother Oh Im so glad
to be homet

As if touched by some marvelous forbidden enchantment

Ro one moves or speaks Only the sound of SIMONS footsteps
at the top of the stairs now entering the DRAWING-ROOM
breaks the spell causing MARY ROSE to look into her
mothers face for reassurance She sees undeniadly sees
the age Slowly her eyes move from MRS MORLAND to

MR MORLAND where she finds again the same inexplicable
Dlight She turns from one faceto another and on each
she sees deeply etched in unaccountable lines love grief
shock shame

toward a wall mirror

As if to straighten her hair her ppearance MARY ROSE
forces her gaze into the mirror » Quite unable to disguise
the trembling anxiety with which she regards her image -
She sees herselflets out her breathfor it is really
herself the self ahe mows For an instant she goes slack
with relief and a smile springs spontaneously to her lips
It is shaky but it is real

However before she can turn back to face the others she
sees in the mirrortis face reflected beside her own

Scream to shake the senses of all who hear it

simply discarded what was left of her

Of the figures in the tableau around the body of MARY ROSE

And it 1s the still’ retounding weaves of this echoed scream
that move now into the dusty old room where KENNETH sits
and waits in the dark the fire and candle long since
guttered out The little door at the beck opens slowly to
the extent of a foot Thus might a break of wind blow it
if there were any wind Presently KENNETH rises Slowly to
his feet He hears nothing he sees nothing But the feel
of the scream is with him As he watches the door
closes softly Now he picks up the candle relicnts it
and with hardly a moments irresolution moves toward the
door He opens it crosses the short length of the hell
and now tries the final door Easily without a murmur of
protest it opens for him He holds the candle up looking
waiting there is nothing He lets out his breath turns
back slowly retracing his steps into the drawing-room

And it is there at last that he is met by MARY ROSE She
stands quietiy in the middle of the room as if mede out of
the light he has brought beck with him She nods politely

‘and speaks
