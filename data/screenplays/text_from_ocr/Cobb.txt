ANGLE ON LUCILLE

The woman at the typewriter a 50-year old stenosecre-
tary responds calmly

LUCILLE
The muse has not descended

STUMP
Yes The muse has left me
stranded here like a beached
whale -- only one phrase one
word from finishing the greatest
essay Ive ever written One
word the right word -- Flaubert
called it ‘le mot juste -- I
ever tell you that

Lucille is a longsuffering saint

LUCILLE
Le mot juste -- the exact right
word the writer needs to tell his

juste until they cried until

they bled

opinions on every subject known to man

FRANK a sportswriter is at the jukebox feeding quarters

Bartender says ‘youre drunk and

Thats another cigar butt

(beat)

Drunk looks down at both cigar
butts and back up at the
bartender and says ‘God damn it

Everyone roars even Stump But Frank as usual is hyper
serious and never quite gets into the revelry

FRANK
Amidst this levity gentlemen I
have some real concerns Mark my
words people will look back on
this year and say that 1960 was
the year that Western Civilization
began its downward trajectory

BILL
You need to get laid Frank

FRANK

( )

STUMP

Stump raises his fists as if to fight Frank responds

MUD

theyre all too chicken to do anything Nobody wants to

A PHONE RINGS at the bar The bartender answers the
phone shouts at the obnoxious sportwriters

REYNALDO

Stump goes to the phone interrupting his own fight

STUMP
(to Frank)
Phone call saved your ass

Stump grabs the phone covering an ear to hear better

STUMP
(on phone)

Stump hangs up the phone and turns His face registers
shock or more precisely bewilderment and wonder

STUMP

him)
Shut up

They do and give Stump their ruffled attention

STUMP

MUD

This impresses the hell out of everyone in the room

FRANK

life before he croaks

BILL

STUMP
The Georgia Peach himself

CRONIES

Frank suddenly is cautionary concerned paternal

FRANK

STUMP

INT NEARLY EMPTY MOVIE THEATER - DAY 5

Al Stump sits alone in the theater except for a teenaged
boy sweeping the aisles who stops to watch the screen

STUMP (VO)
I gathered all the film footage
that existed on Cobb -- which
wasnt much -- and rented the
local theater for the afternoon
(beat)

I too had thought that the great
Ty Cobb had been dead for awhile

ANGLE ON SCREEN 6

The screen fills with (BandW) Movietone Newsreel footage of
Ty Cobb complete with overly sincere NARRATION and MUSIC

NEWSREEL NARRATOR (VO)
This 1905 cameo of an 18-year-old
youth shows a peaches-and-cream
complexion and the piercing eyes
of a lad who would become etc

Onscreen (BandW) -- Cobb as a young ballplayer followed by
images of Cobbs famous batting stance Cobb clowning
etc

STUMP (VO)
His reputation as being difficult
at best psychotic at worst
preceded him But if there was
one thing I knew after all my
years as a journalist covering
politicians celebrities and
sports heroes it was this --

( )

6

Onscreen (BandW) -- Cobb with children Cobb with celebri-
ties Cobb in a parade honoring him and always Cobbs
dashing swashbuckling style of play

STUMP (VO)
The facts -- and public
perception of those facts --
frequently bear little
resemblance

Onscreen (BandW) -- Cobb in action -- His demon fury gives
way to the fierce joy of his playing He slashes a ball
up the alley turns first and never hesitates at second
and as the relay comes into third --

STUMP (VO)
One thing was beyond argument --
he was the most brilliant athlete
of his time perhaps of any time
(beat)
I was determined to find out who
was the real Ty Cobb

Cobb slides with spikes high and a cloud of dust There
is something thrilling and terrifying in the image

moving up into the Sierras into rugged terrain and thick
forests

CUT TO

INT CAR - DUSK 10
Stump straining to see the road a bit wary of this drive

STUMP (VO)
Driving into the Sierras at night
with winter coming on wasnt the
smartest decision Id ever made
but it seemed better than being
late for my first meeting with
Cobb

First drops of rain begin hitting the windshield --
Stump hits the wiper button and the floppy blades
begin ineffectively wiping the windshield Stump
struggles with his vision

STUMP
Shit

POV SHOT THROUGH WINDSHIELD

A dismal wet and obscured view of the mountain road
climbing higher into the Sierras A small roadside gas
station comes INTO VIEW and --

Stump pulls his car into the station

JONAH
Cobb He stopped here for gas

STUMP
I hear hes got a way with kids

Stump heads to a pay phone as the attendant replaces the
wiper blades Stumps breath hangs heavy in the air
Its cold Freezing He drops a set of coins in the
call box He blows on his hands and pulls up his collar
-- he wasnt prepared for the weather to be this cold

He comes to life when he hears a voice on the other

end -- a voice we never hear
STUMP
Hey baby its me

Stump struggles with a map under the dome light as he
drives

DISSOLVE TO

EXT SNOW COVERED MOUNTAIN PASS - HIGHWAY - NIGHT
Stumps car passes a sign that tells all DONNER PASS

STUMP (VO)
I confess I was looking forward
to seeing Cobb and being near
his brilliance My own life
seemed on hold somehow Everyday
churning out the same old articles
drinking at 4 in the afternoon
with the same old guys the same
old excuses for not writing a
novel the same old confused
marriages that we all needed
and were trying to get out of
at the same time Cobb was a
god whose brilliance however
difficult could rub off on
me His problems were different
than mine

ANGLE ON STUMPS CAR 14

which pulls off the road and heads up a small mountain
road among snow-covered pines

A row of mailboxes catches Stumps attention and he
pulls over to review the names with a flashlight He
lights his way across the names of a dozen boxes --
nothing until

The last box enormously oversized bears the name COBB

CLOSE ON STUMP

He smiles Perfect

BACK TO SCENE

His car heads up a mountain road a final hundred yards
comes around a bend in the trees and there it is --

POV SHOT - HUGE MOUNTAIN LODGE 14

In the grand style but like the mailbox grotesquely
oversized

CUT TO

EXT MOUNTAIN LODGE - NIGHT 15
Stump parks and approaches somewhat warily
The sound of BREAKING GLASS and SHOUTING voices

Stump hurries to the door to escape the rain and finds
refuge under the eave The noise is frightening from

that close He stands unsurely -- does he knock
When --
The door is thrown open -- a black man WILLIE 40 with

a suitcase stands wildly upset screaming back into the
house

WILLIE
Fuck you Mr Cobb I have too much
dignity to spend another moment
with you I hope you die before
the sun comes up and may you rot
in hell

The man whirls and is shocked to see Stump standing
there with his own suitcase

WILLIE
Who are you

STUMP
Im a writer

WILLIE

You mean he actually found somebody
to take the job

Willie bursts out into crazed laughter as if the world
of Cobb was finally too absurd Cobb and a writer In
this weather In any weather And the man walks through
the rain laughing heading on foot down off the mountain
as Stump just stares

Stump turns and steps into the open doorway

CUT TO

INT MOUNTAIN LODGE - NIGHT 16

Stump in the front door -- The place is enormous and
barely lit Taxidermied game hangs on the wall
Stump is terrified

A MAN is sitting in an overstuffed chair reading a news-
paper Dressed in a business suit and tie he seems
oblivious to the surrounding chaos He also seems out of
place

STUMP
Mr Cobb

The man looks at Stump and points upstairs without
speaking

More CRASHING sounds from upstairs

STUMP
Mr Cobb

The silence is shattered by a SCRATCH then VIOLIN MUSIC
from upstairs STATIC suggests a record is playing

ANGLE ON STAIRS 17
Stump climbs the stairs with caution -- Until hes just

outside the half open door from which light spills He
hesitates

STUMP
Hello Mr Cobb
A GUNSHOT RINGS OUT -- Ripping through the door Stump
is terrified -- he gasps for air
STUMP

Thank you very much Mr Cobb
but I dont need this job that
bad

Stump turns and creeps back toward the stairs but --
ANOTHER GUNSHOT RINGS OUT -- SHATTERING a hanging LAMP

Stump freeses one more time Silence Then the
voice --

COBB
Yes Mr Stump -- you do need this
job that bad

COBB (CONTD)
(beat)
Now come in here and meet the great
Ty Cobb
(calmly)

I wont hurt you

Stump breathes deeply and steps into the doorway -- He
does it as if theres no choice accepting his fate And
sees

POV SHOT - TY COBB 18

Lying in bed in a robe Unshaven Bottles of booze and
food everywhere And bottles of pills sit on every
surface Two hunting dogs sit on the bed with him

A small record player sits next to he bed A record
spins filling the room with FRITZ KREISLER VIOLIN SOLOS

He places the gun on his night table knocking pills and
bottles to the floor with a crash he barely notices
When he speaks it is without a snarl without threat --
simply even sweetly he says

COBB
On the violin -- Fritz Kreisler
Im a great admirer of his Im

also a great admirer of yours

BACK TO SCENE

STUMP
Thank you

COBB
But you are a hopeless romantic
and only a moderate success

STUMP
Sir I am the most successful
sportswriter in America and not
merely a moderate success

COBB
Of course
(beat)
Give me those pills over there

( )

Stump retrieves some pills that Cobb is pointing towards
Cobb washes down a handful of pills with a bottle of
Scotch Momentarily revitalized Cobb hands Stump a
folded letter which Stump opens to read

COBB
Thats an invitation toa

Hall of Fame in Cooperstown New
York Youre taking me there --

STUMP

COBB

(with utmost

sincerity)
Lie after lie has been written
about me -- my whole life Ive
been misunderstood

(beat)
Youre gonna tell the real story
of Ty Cobb

STUMP

Whats the real story

Cobb climbs slowly out of bed His words are reasoned
and not without passion

COBB
Thats why youre here
(beat)
See theres two kinds of writers
The kind that spin endless yarns
about small subjects thats you
(MORE )

( ) 18

COBB (CONTD)

(beat)
Or theres the kind with one
great subject that consumes them
forever

(beat)
That could be you Because I am
that subject

Cobb hobbles to a table in front of a window The
table is covered with pills bottles needles and
booze

COBB
(suddenly bellowing)
Jameson Get your ass up here

Cobb grabs another bottle of booze and swigs deeply
liquor spilling over him Then suddenly he holds up
his hand A calm comes over him as --

He stares out the window into the snowy woods His
rage has quickly turned into a quiet intense
unsettling focus

STUMP
You okay
COBB
Mmmmmm
POV SHOT - WOODS IN MOONLIGHT 19

moves INTO VIEW
CLOSE ON COBBS FACE 20

His eyes light A flare in his nostrils A twitch And
utter calm

Jameson the man in the suit arrives and stands in
the back of the room He takes notes when Cobb speaks

Cobb picks up the revolver and holds it lovingly

Stump crosses and stands behind Cobb sharing the view

COBB

Cobb smiles and loads the revolver He pushes the window
which swings slowly open

POV SHOT - BUCK IN MOONLIGHT 21

COBB
(to Jameson)

himself)

COBB 22

raises the gun -- he wobbles badly and steadies himself
The gun shakes Then steadies

Stump stands over his shoulder watching the bizarre

action

POV SHOT - BUCK RAISES ITS HEAD 23
Just as

KABLAM The REVOLVER FIRES with a violent kick

The buck spins and runs back into the woods kicking
snow and disappearing in the brush

BACK TO SCENE 24

COBB
Jameson
JAMESON
If Mr Cobb said he got him then

COBB

You have no vision Stump A
writer without vision is a waste
of my time I think I picked the
wrong man

Cobb stumbles back into bed somewhat exhausted by the
ordeal

JAMESON
And I think I better get back to
San Francisco before the storm
hits I11 take care of these
transactions Mr Cobb

And Jameson exits the room

( )

24

STUMP
And Ill be leaving as well

wrong man for the job

COBB
Shut up Stump -- we both know
that Im your meal ticket
(beat)
We need each other
(smiles)
And we start in the morning

STUMP
No

COBB
(calmly)
Yes
Cobb reaches over and defiantly turns UP the MUSIC so
that the room is overwhelmed with Kreislers violin
Stump stares back at this decrepit overpowering figure

Cobb gradually slips into sleep buried in the music
the booze the pills the pain

The morning mist hangs thick over a snowbank in the woods
A rabbit scurries across the snow some quail are flushed

PAN ACROSS the landscape REVEALS the lodge Smoke curls

INT LODGE - MORNING 26

Stump sits hunkered over a tiny portable typewriter on
the kitchen table Cobb mixes a bourbon with orange
juice to wash down some more pills which he takes
randomly

A teletype MACHINE sits on a table nearby -- Throughout

floor Cobb occasionally checks data on the tape

STUMP

COBB

great man has fallen this day

Stump types it out then stops

STUMP

COBB

was a Confederate General killed
at Fredricksburg

STUMP
So Im taking notes

COBB
Hell no Thats the first
line of my autobiography

STUMP
I aint writing it

COBB
Why not

STUMP

Its horseshit Its a third
person comment about someone whos
already dead An autobiography
has to be in the first person --
plus it cant come from the other
side of the God damn grave

COBB
My story can come from any damn
place I want

STUMP
Not to mention you cant call
yourself ‘a prince and great
man -- thats for the world
to decide

( ) 26
COBB
What kind of a fucking writer you
call yourself -- all tied up in

rules and regulations Whats the
point being a writer if you cant
say what you want to

STUMP
Youre not treating me like a
writer -- youre treating me like

a stenographer

BLAM A SHOT RINGS OUT -- Stump types quickly hunting
and pecking with two fingers reading aloud

STUMP
Know ye that a prince and a great
man has fallen this day

COBB

It has a certain ring to it
STUMP

Yes it does
COBB

I thought you might like it
Its yours a gift from me
(beat)
Cobb a prince among men
misunderstood in his genius as
genius always is -
(demands from
Stump )
This is the second line from what
will be the greatest biography of

a great man ever written -- type
it
Cobb checks the tape and suddenly is deep in thought
over some information coming across Stump types
COBB
Bethlehem Steels about to dive
Cobb grabs a phone and dials -- Then barks into the
phone
COBB
(on phone)

Jameson Bethlehems going in
the toilet Dump it all

Cobb slams down the phone momentarily lost in finance

( )

Cobb just 26
STUMP
You got a stock tip for me
COBB
Yeah buy Coca-Cola Were

about to go out in cans

STUMP
Coke in cans I dont think so

stares back in disdain Then suddenly --

Cobb starts coughing terribly He clutches his torso
as if it were about to fall into pieces

COBB
You know whats wrong with Ty
Cobb
STUMP
What
COBB
(proudly)
Every disease known to man -- I
got em all And theyll never
get me in a hospital -- never
(beat)
My heart leaks -- the doctors who

are nothin but a buncha hacksaw
artists give me Digoxin to keep it
pumping

Cobb grabs a bottle of Digoxin pills and flings it across
the room in a rage He flings bottles of pills as he
recites his ailments

COBB
They give me Darvon for the
cancer in my back they give
me Tace for something eatin
up my stomach Fleets Compound
for an infection in my bowels
Librium for my tension insulin
for my diabetes

Cobb grabs a hypodermic needle and awkwardly pours from
a bottle into the chamber Insulin spills as he does

COBB
Fuckin insulin

He jams the needle wildly into his arm without hesitation

( )

26 26

He takes a deep breath as if the drug has produced an
immediate relief from pain

COBB
And if all that wasnt enough
its been two years since I
got my pecker in the air
(beat)
The South may not rise again but
my dick will

The PHONE RINGS

COBB
(barks )

Stump answers the phone
STUMP
(answering the phone)
Cobbs residence hello
(beat)
Hes not here -- whos calling

Ernie Ernie who
(his face drops)

My God
(to Cobb)
Its Ernest Hemingway for you
COBB

Tell him to go to hell

Stump covers the receiver nervously

STUMP
Jesus Christ Ty this is the
great American writer -- this

is the man who inspired me to
become a writer

COBB

Tell him to go to hell anyway
STUMP

Why
COBB

Him and me used to be pals but we
went on a hunting trip once and he
hired a shitty guide

( ) 26

STUMP
Thats it You didnt like a
guide he hired

Cobb looks at Stump with a fierceness that is so over-
whelming so physical that Stump melts

COBB
You tell him to go fuck himself
or Ill kick your Yankee ass

Stump is terrified He reluctantly uncovers the
receiver

STUMP
Mr Hemingway Mr Cobb says
to go to hell
(awkwardly)
By the way Im a big fan of
yours --

CLICK a hang up

Cobb settles into a chair letting the drugs and pills
and booze work their way into his thick body

COBB
Hemingway isnt a bullfighter -- he
wrote about bullfighting What
the hell is that
(beat)
Bullshit Damn painkillers

Cobb rubs his head -- The drugs are taking effect

STUMP
Ty you okay

COBB
Itll pass
(increasingly
woozy )
Stumpy listen to me -- you know
what I need

STUMP
What do you need

COBB
I need a woman
(muttering to
sleep)
A woman is definitely what I
need

And Cobb drifts to sleep in his chair momentarily
overcome with painkillers

Stump stares at the sleeping volcano of a man and
when Cobb starts snoring heavily he rises pulls on
a coat scarf and hat and heads out the door

CUT TO

EXT LODGE - DUSK 27

Snow flurries greet Stump as he heads outside and
darkness is falling He takes a deep breath

STUMP (VO)
I couldnt be around the man for
long without needing a break which
his painkillers gracefully
provided

(beat)

My sanity would soon depend upon
a frequent breath of fresh air a
walk in the woods -- any escape
from what one sportswriter had
called ‘Cobbs brooding soul that
bubbled with violence

Stump lights a pipe as he walks up a trail away from the
lodge toward a ridge all covered with snow The
flurries of snow are getting thicker now

STUMP (VO)
I knew most of the Cobb stories --
first man elected to the Hall of
Fame ahead of the incomparable
Babe Ruth Statistics that havent
been approached in three-quarters
of a century

Stump stops at the ridge and looks down at the partially
frozen Lake Tahoe in the lingering light

STUMP (VO)
But Id known boxing champions and
football players -- they were
gentle souls outside the arena

(beat)

How much of Cobb was an act a
lifetime of theatrical intimidation
to preserve his own legend

STUMP (CONTD)
Legends grow in time Tough guys
are tougher women more beautiful

become heroic

Stump continues walking down a crest of snow through
a stand of snow-covered pines The light is dark
purple eerie and Stump is lost in thought until
suddenly he sees

A trail of blood in the snow He follows it down a
slope past a tree growing deeper thicker And there
it is --

The buck lies dead in the snow in a pool of blood
Stump stops in fear then approaches leans down

and examines --

STUMP
My God

The bucks head has a hole blasted behind the ear

Stump rises quickly to his feet and looks around
The woods are silent Snow falls from a branch And

He hurries back through the woods up the ridge momen-
tarily lost as the snow swirls he finally spots the
lodge

being utterly out of control

COBB

My philosophy is simply this --

says and those who are not his
friends well to hell with ‘em

so relaxed that he pays little attention to the road

drops something on home plate in front of the CATCHER

is long before players wore protective headgear)

Shit it that was my fastball Id

athlete the great HONUS WAGNER

drawn into Cobbs taunts Stoic implacable -- far from

you throw a sinker away in and

holds the bat strangely with a split grip a left-
handed batter he dangles the bat almost parallel to the
ground For all his fierceness theres a delicacy in
the way he holds the bat A baton a paintbrush a magic
wand

Here comes the pitch -- sinker away -- and Cobb unleashes
a swing that is at once quick and powerful He drives the
ball to left the opposite way --

Wagner lunges to his right -- But the ball skips into
left

Cobb streaks to first and rounds the base viciously daring
to stretch it into a double but slamming on the brakes and
returning to first when the throw rifles into second

Cobb shouts defiantly at the pitcher

COBB
You God damn coward You shoulda
thrown at me again You shoulda
hit me in the fucking head

breaks for second The pitch is wide The Catcher fires

Wagner takes the throw as Cobb arrives in a spikes-up
slide

And Wagner swipes a brutal tag in Cobbs face -- his giant
ham of a hand in the tiny glove clutching the ball lashes
across Cobbs mouth Blood gushes The ball pops free
Wagner seems unbothered by the fact that Cobb is safe at
second -- he has bloodied Cobbs face Cobb seems unboth-
ered by the fact that his face is a bloody mess -- he has
stolen second Both men seem satisfied

nods winds up and as he does --

Here comes Cobb with a recklessness beyond reason And
as the pitch arrives in the Catchers hands the Catcher
digs in to take on Cobb --

Cobb slides spikes high flying above the earth his back
leg slashing his spikes like knives It is a slide of
utter defiance and violence a slide intended to harm

A vicious collision between Cobb and the catcher -- blood
and dust The ball rolls free Safe

Cobb and the catcher immediately start punching and in

the police rush out to break up the brawl

Robinson or maybe Josh
Gibson

COBB

his head Stump feeds Willie watching Cobbs racism

spinning continuous 360s down the grade

CLOSE ON THREE MEN 70

The world spins around them as they cling for their

THUD -- the car slams into a bank of snow Suddenly
silence

The three men sit without speaking for several beats
slowly acknowledging that they have survived Finally

COBB
Fucked up roads They dont build
highways like they used to

Willie hands the gun to Stump and climbs out of the car
bidding farewell to Stump as he does

Stump helps Cobb to the registration desk in a clean but
very modest old hotel

A WOMAN 30s stands at the counter in the middle of some
dispute with the clerk She wears a long cheap plain-
cloth overcoat and galoshes

Stump bursts in oblivious to the conversation in
progress

STUMP
Two rooms please

The woman turns to confront the two men Now we see her
On a fabulous platinum-blonde wig is stuck a yellow
slicker-type rain hat The ear flaps are awry the
platinum-blonde wig curls up around it -- the effect is
thrilling

And Stump hands Cobb his beloved pistol which Cobb
takes with great affection and comfort

Stump helps Cobb into bed covering him with a blanket
The gun and the money sit on the pillow next to his
head

Cobb speaks with great pain just before he passes out
from pain drugs and exhaustion

COBB
We havent missed the testimonial

Cobb manages a small pained smile before drifting
off into sleep Stump turns off the light and exits

He pours another drink and sits down to his typewriter

Stump is hunkered over his typewriter pounding away His
VOICE OVER indicates what he is writing

STUMP (VO)
I was a fool for thinking Cobbs
brilliance might be what I needed

at this moment of my life Ty

Cobb was the last thing I needed
(beat)

He was not misunderstood -- he was

understood perfectly well He
hated blacks he hated Jews he
hated Catholics -- he hated
everything except himself and his
own view of the world

drop dead in front of me

and other times he seemed
indestructible

Ty Cobb as a pathetic character
lost in the past paranoia and
the shallow defense of ‘his own

movement -- we get a glimpse of the great athlete he once
was

LOUIS PRIMA
The great Ty Cobb Cmon up

Ive always wanted to ask you
something Mr Cobb with all the
great ballplayers playing right
now -- how well do you think
youd do against todays players

COBB
Well I figure against todays
pitchers Id only hit about 275
-280

LOUIS PRIMA
Thats amazing Mr Cobb
considering your lifetime average
is nearly a hundred points higher
Why do you think youd only hit
-275 against todays pitchers

( ) 84

COBB
Because Im 72 fucking years old
thats why God damn it Give me
that thing

Cobb grabs the mike and takes over
COBB

First of all I wanta thank you
for that song Sweet Georgia

Brown its a great song about
my home state and I appreciate
it

(beat)

That song has become the theme
song for the Harlem
Globetrotters

(as Prima nods with

a smile)
Its too bad such a fine song had
to be stole by a buncha niggers
playing a faggot game in their
underwear

Prima and his cohorts are aghast They cling to the hope
that this is some put-on some joke They force a small
unnatural laugh

Stump winces and leaves the room heading for the bar

COBB
Course the Globetrotters are
owned by a Jew named Saperstein
so whadda you expect

A disaster Prima tries gamely to seize the mike back

LOUIS PRIMA
Thank you very much Another
round of applause for the Georgia
Peach Ty Cobb

is appalled and in disbelief

( ) 84

COBB
Now let me explain to you how to
hit a baseball Its a lost art
Ever since that half-nigger Ruth
started hitting home runs the
skill the art and the science
have been lost

caressed held like a woman

of aman

OFFSTAGE

CASINO MANAGER
Oh God here we go

COBB
Hitting a baseball is really very
easy you cant force it you
cant overpower it you go with
the pitch you let the bat do
the work its all rhythm and
flow

And Cobb starts demonstrating hitting techniques to the
bewildered audience and casino staff He strikes that
familiar strange stance -- choked up on the bat a split
grip the bat held parallel to the ground

world according to Ty Cobb

Cobb talks into a tape recorder sitting on his lap
enjoying the hand microphone

COBB

(into recorder )
And then this fat ass named Babe
Ruth came into the league and damn
near destroyed the game of
baseball We all thought he was
gonna eat and fuck his way outta
the league but he hung around for
a few years --

STUMP
Hung around He was --
(quickly revising)
-- next to you -- the greatest
player of all time He hit 714
home runs

COBB
Anybody can hit home runs Now
excuse me I got work to do

STUMP
Sorry Ty --

And Cobb resumes into the tape recorder

( ) 96

COBB

And look how convenient youve

They look up -- The entrance to the Royston Cemetery A
casually-maintained slope of several acres up a hill

STUMP
That was your sister alright and

COBB
I forgive her

Stump walks into the cemetery to escape Cobb who follows
nonetheless with a cool resolution Stump laughs at
Cobbs comment

( )

143

STUMP

(following along)
Forgiveness is crucial to human
maturity and religious growth

STUMP
Religious growth

COBB
We all need to forgive more Al

angry Youre all pent up

STUMP
Im angry

Through the cemetery they keep walking up a long hill
full of tombstones and shrines and sprays of dead and
dying flowers and gaudy plastic bouquets Cobb following
steadily along with his cane several paces behind Stump

THUNDER shakes the ground And more lightning
COBB

Are you angry because I discovered
you were a whore Is that it

Alimony

STUMP
Im angry

COBB
Is it the divorce You gotta let
go of it

STUMP
I love her I dont want a
divorce

COBB

Sure ya do Youre just so used
to accommodating people that you
dont know what you want anymore
I accommodate nobody

Stump whirls near the top of the hill to face Cobb who
continues making his way along slowly and surely

STUMP
But you have no friends

( ) 143

COBB
Do you Who are they Those
drunken hacks you hang out with
who all think theyre gonna write
the great American novel but all
theyre gonna ever do is bitch and
moan and write lousy leads about
high school football games How
about the brunette in the
courtyard Is she your friend
I heard she fucks everybody -- she
must be everybodys friend

A mausoleum looms behind Stump bigger than anything in
the cemetery classical outsized monumental even
elegant One simple word is above the door carved in
granite COBB

COBB
Im glad were here -- I was gonna
bring you here anyway sooner or

later --
Stump turns to see the mausoleum and the word COBB

STUMP
Which Cobb of Georgia is that

Several beats as the men take it all in Finally
COBB
(with pride)

That is me

And rain suddenly falls from the skies threatening to
soak the two men

Cobb heads for the mausoleum -- Stump follows

CUT TO

INT MAUSOLEUM - DAY 144

Stump is still fuming angry and cynical

STUMP
Under one roof Thats romantic

COBB
You mock my family -- you mock me

Cobb grabs Stump by the throat and stares him in the

eye

COBB

COBB
Being a bastard is a small price
to pay for greatness I too

am a great man

STUMP

Cobbs fist clinches Stumps throat forcing him to hear

Cobb lets Stump go relaxing his grip and --

Stump rages back outside into the rain Cobb stays
dry in the doorway of the mausoleum

( )

147

STUMP
I dont want to be your friend
I dont want to feel sorry for you
So your mothers lover blew your
fathers head off I dont care
You were a prick before it
happened you were a prick after it
happened youve been a prick ever
since and youre a prick now

Cobb quietly takes a hit on his flask from the doorway
of the mausoleum watching Stump rant and rave in the
rain

COBB
Public relations are overrated

STUMP
What the hellre you talking
about

Cobb holds out his flask for Stump

COBB
You need a drink

STUMP
Fuck the drink

Cobb motions for the limo to pull up the slope towards
them

COBB
Youre too angry Al you just
gotta learn to let it out

Stump stands in the rain screaming at Cobb who stands
out of the rain calm centered drinking dying

STUMP
Im gonna tell the truth about you
Cobb Im gonna tell the world you
hate women Jews and niggers

COBB

(calmly)
You shouldnt use the word nigger
Stumpy its racist and demeaning
And I dont hate women -- Im just
not very good with ‘em which puts
me in the same boat with you and
every other man I know

( ) 147

STUMP
You treat people like dirt

Cobb comes out into the rain toward Stump

COBB
The children of America need

Cobb takes him by the arm and tries to lead him to the
limo

STUMP
Get your hands off me

COBB
Cmon Al

looks a mess Cobb is idly playing with his pistol

Hes calm introspective

COBB
Youre an educated man

Stump just sits there drinking

( )

149
COBB
Either my father was inadequate
for my mother he was not
the man I thought he was not a
great man not even a good man
(beat)
or my mother was trash
a common whore
(beat)

Its that simple isnt it

Stump just shrugs and takes another hit

COBB
As a boy I stood in court next to
her because suddenly I was the man
of the house but as I stood there
steadfastly by her side and heard
the jury say ‘not guilty I knew
shed been with another man the
night of the killing

Stump drinks deeply once again

COBB
A man must defend his mother at
all times isnt that right Al
Or am I a fool

STUMP
A man must defend his mother
at all times

COBB
Thats what I thought

And the two men sit there silently rocking slightly
trying to stay warm when there is --

Suddenly a KNOCK at the door -- They stare at each

Cobb puts down the gun struggles to the door and answers

A MAN stands in the rain carrying a briefcase trying
vainly to keep dry

The Man is frozen with terror as Stump rises from the
chair -- drunk and crazed aiming the shaky gun

MAN WITH BRIEFCASE

the man to nearly point-blank range

COBB

Stump looks crazed a bathrobe falling open his feet
bare and wet his hair awry from the rainstorm He aims
the gun at the mans head looks at Cobb with wild glee

( ) 149

STUMP

diplomatic A mans friends dont

COBB

Stump pulls the TRIGGER -- CLICK Empty

As the Man looks up realizing hes alive Stump strikes
him across the face with the gun drawing blood

The Man scrambles to his feet and races from the room
grabbing his briefcase and running to the door

MAN WITH BRIEFCASE
Youre crazy No wonder she
wants to divorce you Youre
crazy

And the Man runs into the rainy night leaving Cobb and
Stump

Stumps head collapses in his hands -- Bewildered
exhausted The two men sit alone for several beats
before Stump speaks He is completely lost

STUMP
I almost killed a man

COBB
A little drunken excess

STUMP
No I put a gun to a mans head
and pulled the trigger I wanted
to kill him

COBB

COBB (CONTD)
If I was hired to write a
biography of the greatest
sportswriter of our time -- a

What happened tonight was private
An intimacy Your own business

It wouldnt belong in a book about

greatness

STUMP

COBB

And when the brunette in the
courtyard brushed against you I

jasmine her black hair against a

white blouse -- you came to life

you saw her naked it was more
than you could bear its okay
Al its okay

Stump looks up at Cobb but says nothing He picks up a
nearly-empty bottle off the floor and takes a hit

COBB

Stump raises his hand motioning Cobb to stop

STUMP

Stump crawls on the bed toward the pillows with the
stupid grace of a drunk looking for a key under the mat

Cobb helps Stump lie down pulling a blanket over him

Stump rolls over to go to sleep Cobb tucks the blanket
around him and picks up the bottle from the pillow

Cobb takes a last hit of the bottle -- Finishing it off

of Ty Cobb The luster returns to the old sign

STUMP (VO)

to re-paint the sign and
disappeared for a while to finish
the manuscripts

And while I waited Ernest
Hemingway blew his brains out
Getty bought Honolulu Oil Company
and the brunette in the courtyard
ran away with a handsome young
lawyer

former glory

STUMP (VO)
And on July 17 1961 Ty Cobb
died quietly in his sleep I
dont believe it was quiet nothing
he did was quiet but thats what
the newspaper writer said who wrote
the lead and we all know that
writers never lie

PAN OVER ACROSS the sign -- to the adjacent cemetery
as --

A hearse enters the cemetery grounds followed by three
cars A very humble ceremony

And the voice of a country gospel singer can be heard

COUNTRY GOSPEL (VO)
There is a fountain filled with
blood
Drawn from Emmanuels veins

flood
Lose all their guilty stains’

STUMP (VO)
but it was the grimmest damn
funeral service Id ever seen

Stump stands in the distance at the back of the cemetery
watching the simple empty service

STUMP (VO)
He left all his money to his
family though no members of it
managed to attend the funeral and
with the rest he founded a hospital
in his own name and an educational
trust fund for poor Georgia
children

I published the lie and put the
truth in a closet

PAN OVER TO the Royston Cemetery in bg

MAUSOLEUM

Nearby two holes in the earth have been opened up and
the caskets of Cobbs mother and father are being moved
into the mausoleum

STUMP (VO)

Cobb and his father and mother
were together at last

(beat)
The man had some deep unexpressed
sorrow that I could never know
I embraced him and I hated him

(beat)
And I knew I would never write a
novel unless you considered Cobb
a work of fiction -- which I did
not

DISSOLVE TO

EXT TIGER STADIUM (DETROIT) - DUSK 164

Stump walks from the dugout to the field He stares up
at the magnificent old structure the overhanging right
field facade the great upper deck almost a century of
baseball has been played there Cobbs palace

STUMP (VO)

My friends were thrilled to hear
that the Georgia Peach was a
helluva guy -- it excused their own
failures -- if Cobb was okay then
by God they were okay

(beat)
But finally I didnt lie for
them or the children of America
or somesuch hogwash -- finally I
lied for myself

(beat)
I needed Cobb to be somebody he was
not I needed him to be a hero
It is my weakness

Stump turns to walk off the field

STUMP (VO)
The book was a moderate success

The empty stadium cavernous half cathedral half
factory

Fritz Kreislers VIOLIN MUSIC that Cobb adored drifts
up
