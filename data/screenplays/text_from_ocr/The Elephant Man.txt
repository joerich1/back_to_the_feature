FADE IN TO steam shooting out of a huge old half-rusted
calliope The music is very loud and raucous Moving up

back we see the black awning entrance to the freak
where FREDERICK TREVES Resident Surgeon and Lecturer
anatomy at the London Hospital is standing with his
us observing the posters of the freaks

Coming along a muddy walkway at the side of the tent is
Treves wife ANNE and their two DAUGHTERS The shrill

whelming music seems to engulf her

She looks discomfited vulnerable and protective of
daughters The girls oblivious to any fear are
their chocolate sweets

CLOSE-UP of Treves looking at a poster

He hears

1 DAUGHTER
Poppa

Treves turns and looks down to a chocolate-covered
smiles at the children and Anne

Anne sees the dirty faces and begins cleaning one of
The other daughter looks into the freak tent

2 DAUGHTER

Poppa may we go in there
ANNE
Alright Your turn

She turns the girl away from the freak tent and begins
cleaning her face

Her kerchief pulls and distorts the little daughters

Suddenly the girl sees a ring of elephants in the
2 DAUGHTER
Oh look M-ummy Elephants

ANNE
Oh elephants Well go see them

She stands
ANNE
(to Treves)

You wont be long

TREVES
Ill join you shortly

She takes the children off toward the elephants

Treves watches them go for a moment then turns and we

go

with him into the dark freak tent He pauses to pay
admission

at a small booth then disappears within

DARKNESS We hear what could be the trumpeting of an
elephant

Treves parts the black canvas and enters the main part
of

the tent Off to his left he sees a man wrapped in a
black

cape holding a conch shell aloft and blowing
powerfully

into it The tent is dimly lit with flickering oil
lamps

People mill about through the weaving corridors To
Treves

right he sees a sign reading The Deadly Fruit of the

Original Sin over a small very dark corridor

Treves enters the passage and disappears into the
shadows

The corridor has a series of flaps and turns to
disorient

the spectator

Treves carefully pushes his way through and arrives at
the

inner chamber

n a roped-off space stands a small stage set at eve-

level

talks

with curtains on three sides On the stage is a bell
filled with grey-murky fluid lit from behind with casts
eerie glow in the chamber Suspended in the fluid is
life-sized body of a baby-doll with the attached head

large snake At the join of head and body is a blob of
unidentifiable organic matter It is obviously phony

the effect is still very disquieting At the bottom of
jar in the muck sits an apple with two large bites

it Behind the jar is a painting on the order of a

triptych portraying Adam on one side Eve on the
the tree flowering over the jar

Treves impassive face is bathed in the watery glow He
studies the strange object with a critical eye In the

we hear movement and an OLDER GENTLEMAN enters He
visibly impressed with The Deadly Fruit of the

Sin

OLDER MAN
A wicked birth

After a moment Treves quietly leaves the inner

As he pushes his way through the corridor the noise
and becomes a cacophony of strange sounds He exits and
a booming roar and the rush of air as a series of
candles mounted in a row on a ten-foot stand are
by THE INCREDIBLE WIND-MAN His BARKER steps up and
to the people

exhalation rivaling even that of

the Great North Wind that he will

now challenge two grown men to attempt

to hold the bellows shut as he applies

the mighty blast of his herculean

breath Are there any volunteers
A few people raise their hands The Barker scans the
and then points over the heads of the volunteers to TWO
toward the back

BARKER

Ah I see two likely lads Come

forward Come forward Pit your

strength against the Mighty Wind-

Man
During the above The Incredible Wind-Man removes his
revealing his great barrel chest and pot-belly
spindly white hairless legs
As the Barker sets the Volunteers the Wind-Man walks
the small platform huffing and puffing and blowing on

conch shell

The Volunteers set the Wind-Man steps up to the end

the bellows takes an enormous breath and twirls his

handlebar moustache as a signal to the Barker

BARKER

Gentlemen Are you ready
THE LADS

Yes we are Right etc
BARKER

Ladies and Gentlemen Let the

The Wind-Man clamps his mouth to the bellows and with

show begins to exhale savagely stamping his feet The

The Barker triumphantly lifts the Wind-Mans hand The
Man ceases to blow removes his lips from the bellows
the Two Lads instantly collapse together on the floor
BARKER

Ladies and Gentlemen THE

INCREDIBLE WIND-MAN
The crowd cheers while the Wind-Man puts the conch
his lips and proudly stamps his feet circling about
Lads
Amidst this applause Treves smiles indulgently He
on looking for something genuine
TWO BOBBIES move through the crowd intent upon a
destination Treves conveys a casual interest in them
Treves moves on to A BEARDED LADY who combs her beard
chewing tobacco and spitting into a spittoon
Treves continues to work his way through the crowd Up
he sees the Bobbies

BOBBIES
Make way Make way

They round a corner
WOMAN (VO)
Oh yes they are theyre yours
alright
We hear the laughter of a crowd
Treves moves closer to see a FAT LADY seated in a chair

the next platform

On each knee she holds a DWARF They are dressed as
several

the

arms

hiding his

A SKELETON MAN stands beside her

SKELETON MAN
I refuse to believe it I will not
accept it Those babies are simply
too ugly they cannot be mine

The crowd laughs uproariously

SKELETON MAN
I dont want them Get rid of them
I dont want to see them

FAT LADY
Darling dont be difficult Lets
take our sweet lovely children on an
outing

SKELETON MAN
Well take these miserable whelps on
an outing alright Well take them
to the zoo WHERE THEY WILL STAY

From the direction the Bobbies have gone we hear
screams
FAT LADY
(pausing at the screams)
Children save yourselves Prevail
upon your Pappa
The two Dwarves get down from her knees and approach

Skeleton Man They kneel and tug at his thin legs

DWARVES
Poppa Poppa Poppa please

At this point a FATHER holding his YOUNG SON in his
passes by Treves
The Young Boy clutches his Fathers neck in fear
face
FATHER

in particular)

This is too much They should not
allow it They should not allow it

Treves very curious now along with several others
their way around the corner

Before him Treves sees an agitated crowd staring at
that from his point of view he cannot see Brushing

is a WOMAN pulling a small confused and frightened

GIRL Getting closer to the commotion he sees four

standing with a well-dressed alderman arguing with

of this particular exhibit

A distraught almost hysterical WOMAN is ineffectual
striking the Owner with her fists about his head and

shoulders crying weakly and incoherently

WOMAN
Beast Beast

Treves is just about to see whatever it is that is
the alarm when one of the Bobbies says
BOBBY
No Thats right out Drop the
curtain

As the curtain drops Treves just glimpses baggy

cuffs and two horribly deformed root-like feet The
distraught Woman has been pulled away from the Owner

sobbing on a Bobbys shoulder

OWNER
You cant do that Ive got my rights

ALDERMAN
I have the authority to close you
down and Im doing just that

In the crowd Treves notices a YOUNG BOY staring ope

the

blankly at the curtain Treves pushes through the glut

people to join the Boy and get a better view The
creature

clamps

actually a large canvas
On it is a life-sized portrait crudely painted of a
that could only be possible in a nightmare It is the

of a man turning into an elephant The transformation
however is not complete there is still more of the

than beast Palm trees in the background suggest the

habitat in which this Perverted object might have once

Filled with curiosity Treves moves toward the curtain

ALDERMAN
This exhibit degrades all who see

it as well as the poor creature
himself

OWNER
Hes a freak How else can he live

ALDERMAN
Freaks are one thing No one objects
to freaks but this is entirely
different This is monstrous and
ought not to be allowed These
officers will see to it that you are
on your way as soon as possible
Good day

The alderman turns and leaves the tent
OWNER
(to himself)
Movin again
He shakes his head in disgust
Now at the canvas Treves tries to lift the edge to get
peek inside the wagon but the meaty hand of the Owner

down on his wrist

FADE TO

OPERATING ROOM - THE LONDON HOSPITAL

We see a bellows pumping air into the open grate of a
iron stove We hear moaning in the background The
flare to a fierce glow From the mouth of the stove
the handles of several cauterizing irons their heads
in the coals Up above the irons Treves stands by a
high operating table covered with black leather His
illuminated by an oil lantern held by a nurse

The room is fairly dark owing to the oppressive

seen through two windows There is also a large sink a
cupboard containing dressings gags manacles emetics

other unattractive things and two hard chairs
TWO STUDENTS and two other DOCTORS MR FOX and MR

are present The two Students are pulling with constant
pressure on a rope tied to the patients leg Treves

Fox are working on a chest wound caused by a machine
There are gear-wheel marks getting progressively deeper
they near a great open gash Mr Hill places a cotton

over the patients nose and mouth and applies drops of
chloroform The patient struggles but soon his moans

and he is unconscious

TREVES
How long has this man been here

FOX
Three quarters of an hour

TREVES
Mmmm Hodges Pierce come closer
Mr Hill take hold of the rope
please Its a machine accident I
expect youll be seeing a good deal
of this

The two medical Students come forward They stare

uneasily
at the gaping wound which bubbles each time the man
takes
an agonized breath
Treves and Fox quickly and expertly tend the wound as
Hodges
and Pierce look on
TREVES
(off handedly)
Abominable things these machines
One cant reason with them
FOX
What a mess
Treves now notices that the students faces have gone a
trifle

ashen

TREVES
What got you into medicine Hodges

HODGES
My father sir Hes built quite a
successful practice I hope to take
it over one day

TREVES
Is that your case as well Pierce

PIERCE
Yes sir Though of course I do have
a great desire to help my fellowman

Treves smiles at them knowingly

TREVES
Of course you do realize that medicine
has changed quite a bit since your
fathers time In those days we didnt

sign of a truly accomplished surgeon--

corner Ive still got mine

HODGES and PIERCE
Oh no sir (etc)

TREVES
Good thats one thing weve always
plenty of
HALLWAY
A hospital MESSENGER BOY dressed in a blue uniform and
can is making his way down the hall He stops and looks

an operating room much like the one we have just seen

Inside the room is empty The Boy closes the door and
continues on to another operating room The Doctors

with great urgency around the operating table Blood is
draining down into a white porcelain bowl A Woman can

heard moaning The Boy looks carefully but finally

the door and continues on his way

TREVES OPERATING ROOM

There is a hissing sound and steam from the cauterizing
the wound comes up obscuring part of Treves face The

is being held down firmly by the other men

The door opens and Treves looks up The Boy pops his
in

I say Freddie what are you about
TREVES
Oh nothing nothing of any great
importance
AERIAL SHOT from third floor of the London Hospital
down on the hospital square
Below Treves is walking briskly across the square
a gate and into the slums beyond

The aerial shot is actually FOXS POV and now we see

filled with curiosity watching the figure from a

Looking down from above and to the side of him we
Treves walking through a cobblestone street still wet
recent rain covered with horse manure and filth of all
The air is smoky from meat burning fires

Rounding a corner we see and approach the painted

dingy shop The door of the shop is windowless and

Treves tries to look under an edge of the canvas To

TREVES
Do you know where the proprietor is

He holds a coin out The Boy nods snatches the coin
then disappears around the corner

Treves turns back to the canvas

A PUB

A noisy pub long and narrow Benches run the length of

back wall with small tables up against them Men are
clustered around the bar talking in groups

We see the Boy standing at one of the tables talking to
Owner greedily consuming his lunch as he listens The
gestures outside

OUTSIDE THE PUB

The Boy comes out the door quickly followed by the
hurriedly putting on his coat fumbling with a riding
the last of his sandwich stuffed in his mouth

Treves pulls a purse from his coat extracts a coin and
it out

TREVES

showing Are you the proprietor

OWNER
Handsomely Who sent you
TREVES
Pardon me
OWNER

Never mind Im the owner
He snatches the money
INSIDE THE SHOP

Total darkness We hear the sound of the padlock being
removed The door opens and light streams in The

covering the windows at the front of the shop obscures
other light The Owner enters followed by Treves and
Boy From his expression as well as Treves we can

there must be an awful stench in the room No one says
small

with

blocked

a

blanket

from

the

the

toa

word The Boy closes the door while the owner lights a
gas light We can now see the shop It it empty grey

dust cold and dank Some old tins and a few shriveled
potatoes occupy a shelf The far end of the shop is

off by a curtain suspended from a cord by a few rings
The Owner approaches it

OWNER

Here we are sir

(ticking it off by

rote)
Life is full of surprises Ladies
and gentlemen consider the fate of
this creatures poor mother In the
fourth month of her maternal
condition she was struck down by a
wild elephant

(leering)
Struck down if you take my meaning
on an uncharted African isle The
result is plain to see ladies and
gentlemen THE TERRIBLE ELEPHANT
MAN

The rings rattle back and the curtain is omen We see
bent figure crouching on a stool covered by a brown
In front of it on a tripod is a large brick heated

below by a bunsen burner From the blanket protrudes a
perfectly normal left arm and hand warming itself over

brick

It does not move when the curtain is drawn

Treves steps closer The Owner watching his every
turns-and smiles at him He bangs his riding crop on
wall and yells to the crouched figure as if speaking
dog

BOY
Stand up

The figure comes forward and lets the blanket fall to
ground and we see the ELEPHANT MAN himself
Treves his eyes wide with horror and wonder his mouth

open steps backward in an instinctive movement of self
preservation

The Owner laughs

The Elephant Man is naked to the waist his feet are
and he wears a pair of worn trousers from a fat mans
suit He is a little below average height and looks

from the bowing of his back His head is enormous and
misshapen as big around as a mans waist From his

projects a huge boney mass almost obscuring his right

His nose is a nose of flesh recognizable only from its
position

From the upper jaw projects another mass of bone

from the mouth like a stump turning the upper lip

out making a slobbering aperture

It almost gives the impression of a rudimentary trunk
tusk On top of his head is a handful of lank black

At the back of it hangs a bag of spongy skin
cauliflower These loathsome growths cover his back and
down to the middle of his thighs The right arm is

and shapeless the hand like a knot of tuberous roots
left arm is not only normal but delicately shaped

fine skin and a hand that any woman might envy From
chest hangs another bag of flesh like the dewlap of a

lizard

His legs are also grossly deformed his feet great
stumps

Behind him as painted in the portrait are two crudely

constructed palm trees

The Owner harshly raps again

OWNER
Turn around

The Elephant Man begins to turn The boy filled with

malicious

glee at seeing the monster obey screams

BOY
Turn around Turn around

The Elephant Man completes his turn and comes to rest

We see a CLOSE-UP of the Elephant Man looking at
Treves His

face is utterly devoid and incapable of expression

We see the Elephant Mans eyes He closes them

OUTSIDE THE SHOP

The Owner is locking up

Treves facing the street drinks in the fresh air He
is

trying to forget his shock put everything into focus

He looks at the garish portrait again

Treves produces his purse

The Owner smelling money turns

Treves hands him several coins

TREVES
So youll bring him to me tomorrow

1000 am Mr

OWNER
Bytes Mr Bytes Hell be there

TREVES
Ill send a cab Here is my card

Treves hands the Owner a card The Owner greasy and

dirty
shakes Treves hand and squeezes his arm
OWNER
Now we got a deal We understand
each other guv We understand
each other completely
The Owner gives Treves the evil look of a conspirator
Treves walks off disoriented
The Owner reads the card and smiles at Treves walking
away
down the street
DISSOLVE TO OUTSIDE THE SHOP
A CABMAN is knocking on the door of the shop staring
at the

portrait The door opens revealing a figure ina
floor-length
black cloak On his head is an extremely large hat cut

to

the lines of a yachting cap A grey-flannel curtain
hangs

from the bottom of the cap all the way around hiding
his

face

There is a horizontal slit in front for the eyes On
the

figures feet are large bag-like slippers The only
part of

the body seen at all is the left arm and hand which
protrudes

from the cloak holding a crude walking stick

The figure seems to loathe being in the open We can
just

barely see in the darkness within the Owner standing to
one

side of the door obviously enjoying the surprise on
the

Cabmans face The Owner steps abruptly into his view

THE RECEIVING ROOM - LONDON HOSPITAL

The receiving room is a bare hall painted stone color
has rows of benches and a long desk where entries are
and certificates and other papers are issued It is a
harsh place

CABMAN
Not at all sir My pleasure

He exits
Treves turns and sees the Matron staring
TREVES
Ill be in my rooms Mothershead
Im not to be disturbed
She nods silently Treves looks at the figure for a
TREVES
Come with me please
He starts to go out of the room The hooded figure just
there motionless
We see the whole room the people now silent They all
at the figure
No one makes a move

MATRON
You heard the doctor Go on

Treves turns to look at the hooded figure who stands

moment then slowly shuffles after him Mrs

Mothershead and

sight

the people in the room watch him go When he is out of
they all begin to talk excitedly

Mothershead stands fixed and watches too ignoring the
noisy
room

TREVES OFFICE

The door opens and Treves leads the hooded figure to a
chair

in front of his desk and helps him to sit down
furtively

trying to look into the eye-slit of the mask In the
small

room the smell of the Elephant Man is overwhelming

Treves goes to the window and opens it He nervously
tries
to compose himself then turns to the hooded figure

TREVES
My name is Frederick Treves I am
a surgeon here at the London Hospital
and I lecture in anatomy at the
Medical College I would very much
like to examine you Would that be
all right

The figure in the chair is still Treves is at a loss
His

sense of discomfort is growing He looks at the floor
fora

moment then locks his eyes on the figures left arm

TREVES
Ah yes Um first I would like to
ask you a few questions would that
be all right

The figure does nothing Treves sits down at his desk
and
picks up a pencil

TREVES
Good Now lets see Your Owner
um the man who who looks after

you tells me that you are English
and your name is John Merrick Is
that correct

The figure does nothing
TREVES
Do you know where you were born
Where you come from

The figure does nothing

TREVES
I tell you what Ill ask you a
question and you shake your head
like this for no and nod like this
for yes alright Do you understand

The figure following Treves movements nods very

slowly
yes Treves sighs with relief
TREVES
Are you in any pain
The figure begins to babble incoherently Treves
alarmed
interrupts
TREVES
Um no Just nod your head like this
for yes and shake it like this for
no Now are you in any pain
Again the figure following Treves movements shakes
his
head no
TREVES
Are your parents still alive
The figure does nothing Treves is quite nervous
TREVES
Do you understand Are they dead
Your father your mother
The figure begins to moan There are two sharp raps at
the

door The hooded figure flinches
The door opens and Fox pokes his head into the room
FOX
Freddie what you doing for I say

do open a window in here or

He notices the hooded figure
FOX
Oh Im dreadfully sorry I had no
idea that I say

Treves quickly rises and pushes Fox out into the

hallway
following him and closing the door
IN THE HALLWAY
Treves and Fox are standing outside the door to Treves
office
FOX
Good Lord Freddie What have you
got in there
TREVES
Youll know presently At the meeting
of the society But until then I
beg of you Fox keep it to yourself
FOX
Certainly if you insist You must
have quite a find there
TREVES

FOX

Treves turns to go back in then stops
TREVES
Ill tell you this much Fox its

dealt with Keep it to yourself

He goes back in shutting the door

Treves turns the key in the door He turns to the chair

figure had been occupying but he is not there

The figure is hiding in the corner crouched behind a

Treves looks quickly around the room and finally sees
He looks at the figure for a moment

TREVES
Come sit down

The frightened figure just crouches there looking at
Treves goes to him pulls him up and over to the chair

TREVES
Sit down

The figure sits Treves pauses uncertainly

TREVES
I think Ill examine you now Ill
save the questions for later Will

you take off your hat now please
The figure does nothing Treves moves to him
TREVES
Dont be frightened I simply want
to look at you Do you understand
The figure leans back fearfully From behind him we see
the top of his wide hooded head
Treves standing before him lifts the hood up and
TREVES
(more to himself)
Thats right dont be frightened
Dont be frightened

DISSOLVE TO LECTURE HALL - PATHOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF

BRIGHT LIGHT

As we pull back and down in a slow spiral we see the

is coming through high windows We now see several rows
distinguished doctors talking to each other in

As we continue to spiral down we see Treves before them

podium Behind him are two ASSISTANTS standing beside a
curtained stall Treves raps a pointer stick on the

to bring the meeting to order We move behind the stall
the Assistants part the curtains and we see the

of the Elephant Man The doctors talk among themselves
quietly

TREVES

He is English he is twenty-one years
of age and his name is John Merrick
Gentlemen in the course of my
profession I have come upon lamentable
deformities of the face due to injury
or disease as well as mutilations

and contortions of the body depending
upon like causes but at no time

have I met with such a dreaded or
perverted version of a human being

as this man I wish to draw your
attention to the insidious conditions
affecting this patient Note if you
will the extreme enlargement of the
skull and upper limb which is
totally useless The alarming
curvature of the spine Turn him
please the looseness of the skin
and the varying fibrous tumors that
cover 90 of the body

Treves voice fades as we DISSOLVE TO the Doctors who

at
first were rigid and flustered and now bent forward
concentrating obviously consumed with interest
Spiraling down again we see Treves finishing his
lecture
TREVES
And there is every indication
that these afflictions have been in
existence and have progressed
rapidly since birth The Patient
also suffers from chronic bronchitis
As an interesting side-note in spite
of the afore-mentioned anomalies
the patients genitals remain entirely
intact and unaffected
Treves nods to the Assistants and they go to the
Elephant
Man We see them in shadow untying the loose knot of
the
loin cloth
CLOSE-UP of the shadow of the head of the Elephant Man
It

goes up for a breath

TREVES
So then gentlemen owing to this
series of deformities The congenital
exostoses of the skull extensive
papillomatous growths and large
pendulous masses in connection with
the skin the great enlargement of

seated by the desk Treves stands behind him measuring
head with calipers He removes the calipers and notes
span then sets them on the desk He places the hood

the EMs head Treves sits at his desk and makes some

notes He becomes more absorbed in his notes than in
EM The EM makes an unintelligible sound

TREVES
Hmm

The EM is silent Treves only now realizing that the
has said something looks up at him

TREVES
Hmm

The EM is silent Treves passes it off as a sigh and
back to his work

TREVES
Its been a long day for everyone

He closes his notebook and rises He remembers
TREVES
Oh yes youll need a cab
(to the EM)
Stay
He exits The EM is alone He rises and shuffles
about investigating the room He goes to the desk and

touching things including the calipers He notices the

Treves gave to the Owner tucked in the back pages He
for a moment and then takes the card His hand

disappears
into the cloak and he moves back into the corner
behind the
stiff black operating coat
Treves re-enters
TREVES
Come with me
The EM takes up his stick and follows Treves out
UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - THE LONDON HOSPITAL
We see Treves and Fox alone at a window They are
looking
down on the hospital square Treves had previously
crossed
and see the EM lit by gaslight and moving to a
waiting
cab
FOX
You never mentioned his mental state
TREVES
Hes imbecile no doubt from birth
He speaks but its all gibberish
No the mans a homeless idiot
(to himself)
I pray God hes an idiot
The EM as he is getting into the cab stops turns
and
looks to the upper stories of the hospital Treves and
Fox
are joined by three laughing colleagues who clap Treves
on

the back

THE FIRST
Quite a coup Freddie Youll look
splendid in the journal

THE SECOND
Where ever did you find that creature

From the upper story we watch the cab drive away

THE THIRD (VO)

From outside the window we see Treves surrounded by his
laughing friends

ENTRY HALL - TREVES HOME

We see a door It opens and Treves walks in He shuts
door locks it goes to a coat rack on the wall and
his overcoat and hat He notices his reflection in a

and examines himself wearily Annes smiling reflection
appears beside his

ANNE
Did it go well darling

TREVES
Yes very well I think Are the
girls in bed

ANNE
Yes and they send their kisses

Would you like your sherry now

TREVES
No I think a whiskey

We move past Annes reflection to a CU of Treves
WHITECHAPEL - NIGHT

We now see a bunsen burner roar of flame reflected in
eyes Pulling back we see Bytes quite drunk sitting
sausages over the hot brick

He takes another drink from his gin bottle Up comes a
belch and he takes another drink

The EM is crouched against the wall with a bowl of
and a cup of water in front of him With his good hand

is picking tiny pieces of potato and feeding himself
even

little

smacking

just

Bytes

very

he

wheezing

eating is fairly loud and animal-like The drinking is
worse
The Boy is across the room asleep wrapped in ragged
blankets
The EM takes a drink of water making a loud
slurping sound
Bytes looks up from his cooking with a smoldering look
waiting for him to make the sound again He does and
takes his crop and violently jabs him
BYTES
Belt up you misbegotten garbage
(mumbling to himself)

How can I eat with that

Bytes takes a mouthful of gin and mockingly slurps it
mimicking the EMs sound

BYTES
(yelling)
How can I eat with THAT

The EM picks and eats some more and then drinks again
tentatively

Because of his fear the water catches in his throat and
spits and coughs out onto the floor gasping and

for breath

Bytes is up and whacks him with his riding crop

BYTES
Out of my sight

The EM struggles to get up carrying his food

BYTES

his speed)

He jabs the EM again spilling his potatoes and water

BYTES
You clumsy sod

He pushes the EM again then slips on the potatoes
falls heavily to the floor crying out in shock Then
hits him The EM backs up

BYTES
you

The Boy wakes up in fear Bytes moves quickly toward
EM raising his crop The EM stumbles and falls
onto the floor His head goes back and he begins

air Bytes yanks him up and hits him in the face with
riding crop The force of the blow knocks a glob of
into the air from the EMs mouth The EM gasps and
horribly as Bytes hits him again and again

From across the room

BOY
Bytes DONT

Bytes goes right on with the beating
BYTES

This wont do my lad This just

wont do
RECEIVING ROOM - LONDON HOSPITAL
We see the eyes of the Boy As we pull back from them
widen with recognition
WIDE SHOT of the Receiving Room Treves has entered and
Boy walks quickly up to him

BOY
Our man is sick Come right away

TREVES
What is it

BOY
Like this
(he breathes heavily
in and out to
demonstrate the EMs
difficulty)

TREVES
Ill get my bag

INSIDE THE SHOP

We hear the sound of wheezing coming from the EM who

is
sitting propped up against the stage wrapped in a
blanket
His head bent forward toward his knees Bytes is going
to
the door as it opens and the Boy leads Treves in
Treves immediately goes to the EM
BYTES
What did you do to him Hes been
like this all night
TREVES
What do you mean
BYTES
He was fine when he left here and
now look at him
TREVES
I intend to
Treves pulls the blanket away from the EM exposing
several
bruises and bloody cuts Treves freezes at the sight
and

slowly turns to look at Bytes

TREVES
What happened

BYTES
He fell
(guardedly)
He falls

TREVES
He must have taken quite a fall

He looks up at the riding crop in the hand of Bytes

then to
the strangely nervous and silent Boy
BYTES
Hes a clumsy git Never watches
where he is going
TREVES
Why is he sitting up like this He
needs rest
BYTES
Thats the way he sleeps If he lays
down hell die
(he points to his
neck and leans his
head back)
Heads too heavy
Treves turns his attention to the EM He lifts his
head
higher and examines the EMs eyes The EM who had
been
oblivious up until this point looks into Treves eyes
and
recognizes him With his good hand he reaches up and
touches
Treves arm almost as if appealing to him Treves eyes
lock

on his

TREVES
This man belongs in hospital

BYTES
(apprehensively)
Cant you fix him up here Hes
my livelihood Listen

TREVES
You listen youre not going to have
much of a livelihood if this man

weak and I dont know how much damage
has been done by his fall Now

Bytes considers and then snaps his fingers at the Boy

down over Treves who busily examines the wheezing EM
BYTES
I really appreciate this guv You
know theres lot of things that I
can do for you I move in the proper
circles for this type of thing
(motioning toward the
EM)
In fact anything at all if you
take my meaning

Treves uncomfortable rises Bytes grips his hand and

the other gathers the material of his sleeve in a slow
deliberate squeeze

BYTES
I like doing business with you You
and I understand each other
completely I know I can trust you
Cant I
TREVES

Everything will be seen to

ISOLATION WARD LANDING

At the door of Merricks attic room stand two buckets
very dirty water We hear footsteps coming up stairs

a young porter carrying two buckets of clean steaming
He puts them down knocks on the door and takes the
water downstairs The door opens Mrs Mothershead

the steaming buckets and takes them inside shutting

ISOLATION WARD

Merricks seated in a tin bathtub trying to hide his
nakedness Mrs Mothershead pours the water in She

to his surroundings
Treves sits beside him

TREVES
The disease is shocking

Merricks eyes flicker

TREVES
I wonder how far it can go before
it

Merrick flinches and pulls away

MOTHERSHEAD
Sit still Dont wiggle about like a
pup I wont stand for any
foolishness

Treves leans forward and looks at Merrick Merrick
still his eyes closed apparently in a reverie

TREVES (V0O)

Its pretty certain that if he had
the disease as a child he was
abandoned But in that case hed
have to have had care The very fact
that hes alive bears that out

(cut to Treves)
But where

Merrick is listening

MOTHERSHEAD
The workhouse

TREVES
Yes The workhouse

At this word Merrick begins to babble wildly
alarmed he thrashes about in the tub spilling water

The young PORTER is exiting with great difficulty
large iron door carrying the two buckets He sets one

The Night Porter looks at his spattered shoes then up
the Young Porter

Suddenly the Night Porter kicks the other bucket of
water violently sending it splashing all over the

Porter

NIGHT PORTER
Now you need the scrubbing ducks

He lets his cigarette drop to the ground then stamps
grinds it with his brass-heeled boot all the while

Then he turns on his heel and leaves

Dark clouds rolling through an evening sky

We hear the slow metallic footfalls of the Night

boots He appears and walks into a darkened womens

The women are all asleep Some coughing fitfully
moaning quietly The Night Porter walks down the aisle
the beds We see several of the sleeping women as he
them Finally he comes to a young beautiful woman her
wide open watching him with intense fear On either
her are two very ancient women snoring deeply The
woman has her arms tied suspended in traction above

The Night Porter moves to her his shadow engulfing

She starts to move rattling the apparatus above her
Porter puts a finger to his lips
NIGHT PORTER

Hush love I told you before one

word from me theyll toss you back

on the street and then those pretty

little arms of yours will never grow

She turns her head away closing her eyes He moves in
CLOSE-UP of a gas light in a hallway The leaping flame
a low roar
CUT TO ANOTHER HALLWAY

Somewhere a door is opened and the squeak sounds

like the trumpeting of an elephant We hear again the
footfalls of the Night Porters boots and he appears

He

goes to the narrow stairway marked Isolation

He stops and casually looks about He takes a swig of
his

gin then starts up the stairs

ATTIC WARD

Merrick as before the light is very dim We hear the
echoing

footfalls of the Night Porter coming up the stairs
Merricks
head immediately comes up from his knees As it does a

small
object falls from where his head rested
He picks it up and puts it in a pocket of his cloak it
is
the portrait of the beautiful woman which he saw in
his
dream
Suddenly the door swings open and the Night Porter
bottle
in hand is standing there He walks into the room and
sees
Merricks shape on the bed
NIGHT PORTER
Here he is the old fiend of the
night the terror of the London
Lets have a look at you Lets see
what makes em scream
He turns up the light and sees Merrick clearly The
Night
Porter jumps back awe struck
NIGHT PORTER

NIGHT PORTER

He offers Merrick his bottle with a swift almost

motion Merrick pulls away from him

NIGHT PORTER

WHITECHAPEL ROAD

We see a horses head in CU snorting steam into the

chill

morning air The horse is harnessed to a milk wagon
parked

in front of the London Through the open back of the
wagon

we see the MILKMAN and past him Treves walking
towards us

MILKMAN
Here early again eh Mr Treves If
you dont mind my saying so sir
with your early habits youd a
made a fine milkman

TREVES
Good morning Charley Ill keep
that in mind
Treves walks up the path into the hospital

HALLWAY (MORNING)

Treves carrying a bowl crosses the upper hall and

starts

to the narrow stairway to the Isolation Ward Over his

shoulder we see him knock twice on the door As the
door

swings open the camera pushes past him and we see the
room

The lamp is still burning but Merrick is nowhere to be
seen

Treves enters looking about for him

TREVES
Mr Merrick

Theres movement in the corner beside the bed Merrick
rises

slightly from the shadow The light from the lamp hits
his

frightened eyes

TREVES
Good morning John Ive brought
your breakfast
Treves is unsettled by the sight of Merrick cowering

down on
the floor
Merrick begins to babble Treves enters the room
placing
the bowl on the table and going to Merrick
TREVES
What are you doing down there Come
up John come up on the bed The
cold floor is bad for you I wont
hurt you come on now
He helps Merrick up onto the bed and goes back to the
table
for the bowl
TREVES
You must eat We must keep your
strength
He has turned back to the bed but Merrick has slipped
to
the floor again still trying to hide himself in the
corner
TREVES
What on earth is the matter with
you
He puts the bowl down again and goes back to Merrick
who
seems very upset at leaving his hiding place
TREVES
Now please John you must do as I
say Come up from there
He starts to help Merrick up but Merrick just presses
himself
farther back in the corner still babbling There are
two

raps at the door Treves goes to it and lets
Mothershead in

MOTHERSHEAD
Good morning Mr Treves Itll be
his bath-time soon Has he eaten

TREVES
Not quite yet Mrs Mothershead
There seems to be some difficulty
this morning

They both look at the bed Merrick has almost

disappeared
under it
MOTHERSHEAD
Wont come out eh
TREVES
No hes very upset about something
MOTHERSHEAD
Just being obstinate sir Ill handle
it
She goes to Merrick and takes hold of his left wrist
MOTHERSHEAD
Alright my son none of this fuss
Come up from there this instant
She starts to force him up from the floor Merrick is
moaning
now still trying to get away
TREVES
No Dont pull at him like that We
dont want to frighten him more than
he already is
By this time Mothershead has almost got him back on the
bed
MOTHERSHEAD
Honestly sir you must be very firm
with this sort Otherwise theyd lay
about on the floor gibbering all day
long All he understands is a good
smack
They help Merrick settle back on the pillow Merrick is
still

making desperate unintelligible sounds

TREVES
Hes had his share of smacks
Mothershead I expect thats what
drives him under the bed We must
use patience and understanding with
this man
MOTHERSHEAD

Perhaps youve got the time for that
Mr Treves I certainly dont Ive
got an entire hospital to look after
and you have your real patients
Dont waste your time with him sir
its like talking to a wall I dont
mean to be harsh but truthfully
what can you do for him Ill be
back later for his bath And Mr
Carr Gomm would like to see you when
you have a moment Good day sir

She exits Treves shuts the door behind her and turns

back
to the bed
TREVES
(to himself)
What good am I to you
He goes to the bed and sits down in front of Merrick
angered

by his own seeming uselessness in the situation

TREVES

What is my purpose Its so
important that I understand you I
want to help you I want to be your
doctor

(directly to Merrick)
but I cant help you unless you help
me unless I know what you are
feeling I believe theres something

want to say but Ive got to
understand you Do you understand

Merrick hesitates then starts babbling again

TREVES
No You are going to talk to me We

Slowly Merrick nods yes

of soup is spilling on her apron She catches up with
Mothershead They speak as they walk

NORA
Oh Mrs Mothershead please forgive
my behavior yesterday Im sorry if
youre having to do extra work on my
account It was just seeing it

MOTHERSHEAD
Patients here are not its They

Good God girl Mind your broth

Mothershead continues on Nora guiltily watches her go

ISOLATION WARD

Treves and Merrick are absorbed in their work A knock

at the door

TREVES
Come in

Mothershead enters

TREVES
Why my dear Mrs Mothershead how
good of you to join us Mr Merrick
will you please introduce yourself

MERRICK
(hesitantly)
Hello my name is John Merrick

MOTHERSHEAD
Good Lord Mr Treves

TREVES
(exuberantly)
Weve made tremendous strides today
Mothershead He listens and repeats
with great attention and this
certainly isnt easy for him

MOTHERSHEAD
Parrots can do as much Mr Treves
Its all very nice but I dont see
the point You know they wont let
him stay here

TREVES

(lowering his voice)
Im sure that if Mr Merrick made a
good impression on the hospital
committee theyd see that hes the
exception to their rule Now Im not
expecting miracles Im not saying
hell be able to read or write but
I do think that I can get him to
speak for himself Im going to
arrange things with Carr Gomm right
now

(to Merrick)
That was very good John very good
Thats all for today We shall do
some more tomorrow Mothershead

Mrs Mothershead sets the tray down beside Merrick

TREVES
Ill see you soon

He and Mothershead exit Merrick watches the door
close He
sighs quietly looks about and sees the Bible on the

bedside

table He picks it up and gently runs his fingers over
the

cover

RECEIVING ROOM - THE LONDON

There is total pandemonium in the receiving room The
room

is filled with screaming men women and children Two
drunken
now
hysterical
screaming and
Two

intercede

still
womens
waiting
for
hospital
some The
closer

crowd

CUT TO

about

his

women have been fighting with broken bottles and are
covered with blood and cuts The women are still

one minute theyre sobbing then in an instant

intent upon fighting again The crowd keeps them apart

Bobbies stand in the background making no move to

To the side we see Bytes watching everything It is

too violent a scene for the Nurses to come to the

aide and they stand up in the front of the room

Bytes makes his way along the side of the crowd waiting
a chance to get behind the Nurses and on into the

Now the women begin sobbing again and things quiet
Nurses come forward into the crowd Bytes moves over

to the hallways When the Nurses have all gone into the

he seizes the chance and disappears into the hospital

Bytes appears and walks down hospital hallway looking

CARR GOMMS OFFICE
The door opens and Treves enters

CARR (VO)
Ah Treves

Treves sits in the armchair Carr Gomm is sitting at
desk

CARR
Have you contacted the British Home
and the Royal Hospital

TREVES
Ah no sir I had planned to see
them in the morning

CARR
Good How is the patient

TREVES
Hes doing very well In fact thats
why I came to see you I think that
if I were to present Mr Merrick to
the hospital committee then they
would have a chance to see for
themselves not only the extraordinary
nature of the disease but of the
man as well If the committee had a
chance to speak with him hear him
say a few words for himself Im
sure they would see him as a patient
rather than as a violation of the
rules

CARR
A few words I thought he was
imbecile

TREVES
Well sir perhaps I should explain

CARR
I really dont think thats necessary
Treves Im quite sure the committee
will be able to make an equitable
decision on the merits of the case
such as they are

TREVES
I dont agree No one can make a
reasonable decision about this mans
future without at least meeting him
No doctor would presume to diagnose
a patient he had never met

CARR
No Treves its out of the question
Now if it was up to me Id say
Certainly lets meet the fellow
by all means Im sorry I simply
cant speak for the other members of
the committee

TREVES
Then will you meet him as a
representative of the committee
CARR
Mr Treves its out of the question
I want to hear as soon as possible
what the other hospitals can do Im
sorry

HALLWAY - STAIRCASE - THE LONDON

We see Treves leave Carr Gomms office and walk toward
us to
the stairwell

As Treves begins down the stairs he sees Bytes on the
next
landing coming up

Bytes spots him and goes toward him

BYTES
I want my man back

TREVES
Just a moment how did you get in
here

BYTES

Never mind that I want my man

TREVES
Hes still very sick Please come
downstairs with me Ill explain the
situation

BYTES
(shouting)
DONT Dont muck me about Youve
had plenty of time to fix him up
and hes leaving with me NOW Do
you understand me Now Mr Treves
We had a bargain

TREVES
You misunderstood This man suffered
a severe fall if you take my meaning
Hes my patient now and I must do
what

BYTES
Pull the other one why dont you
We made a deal
TREVES
I know what youve done to him and
hes never going back to that

BYTES
Hes a freak Thats how they live
Were partners him and I business
partners Youre willfully deprivin
me of my livlihood

TREVES
All you do is profit from another
mans misery

BYTES
You think youre better n me YOU
wanted the freak to show all your
doctor chums and make a name for
yourself you guv So I gave him to
you On trust in the name of science
And now I want him back

TREVES
You dont own this man

BYTES
I want him back

TREVES
So you can beat him So you can starve
him A dog in the street would fare
better with you

BYTES
Ive got my rights damn you and
Im going to the authorities

CARR (V0O)
Well go to the authorities

Now we see Carr Gomm standing above them at the top of
the
stairs

CARR
By all means do so In fact Ill
fetch them myself Im quite sure
theyd be very interested in your
story as well as ours

Livid Bytes looks from Carr Gomm to Treves at a loss
for
Carr

down

words

TREVES
Now I think we really do understand
one another
BYTES
(venomous ly)
Right Right
He backs slowly down to the landing eyeing Treves and

Gomm At the landing he casually turns and disappears

more stairs Treves turns and gazes at Carr Gomm

CARR
Singularly unpleasant chap uh
I dont suppose there would be any
harm in my meeting your patient
Mr Treves
TREVES
(gratefully)

Thank you very much Sir Shall we
say in a few days then

CARR
Shall we say two oclock tomorrow
afternoon

TREVES
(slightly taken aback)
Wh whatever is most convenient
for you sir

CARR
Two oclock then you know Treves
It seems this acquaintance of yours
has become rather more than just an
acquaintance

TREVES
ves Sir

They part company We follow Treves down the stairs
TREVES

(muttering)
Two oclock
Then we follow Carr Gomm to his office door He stops

short
CARR
(mumbling out loud)
Elephant Man I dont want to meet
an Elephant Man
HALLWAYS - THE LONDON (NIGHT)
Again the hospital is closing down for the night
Lights go

off in each hallway The staff is vacating the
hospital As
the last light goes off we hear the great iron door

slam

shut

TREVES HOUSE - BEDROOM (NIGHT)

Anne is at her dressing table brushing out her hair
She is

in a very flattering dressing gown ready to turn in
We see

her reflected in the mirror as well as Treves who is in
his

robe in the background seated at his side of their bed
deep

in thought Anne looks at Treves and smiles
affectionately

ANNE
(coyly)
Freddie

Getting no response she renews her efforts

ANNE
Freddie Freddie dont look so
discouraged

TREVES

I shouldnt be We made great progress
today I taught him to repeat a few
basic phrases He did rather well
too but I had to lead him every

step of the way Though frankly at
times I was unsure of who was leading
whom

ANNE
What do you mean
TREVES
Well I wasnt sure whether he was
parroting me because thats all he
was capable of or whether he sensed
that thats all I wanted to hear
and he was trying to please me

ANNE
But I thought you said that he was
rather simple

TREVES

He is I mean Ive always thought
he was I think he must be Is he
simple Or is that just something
Ive wished upon him to make things
simpler for myself

Anne puts down the brush and rises

ANNE
Frederick why are you so interested
in this particular case

TREVES
I dont know I cant explain it If
this is an intelligent man trapped
in the body of a monster then Im
under a moral obligation to help
free that mind free that spirit as
best I can to help him live as full
and content a life as possible But
If hes an imbecile whos body I
cant treat and whos mind I cant
touch well then my obligation is
discharged They can put him where
they will he wont be bothered I
wont be bothered and everyones
conscience can remain free and
untroubled And that is my dilemma
what is in his mind

Anne sympathizing with his concerns goes to him and
puts
her arms around him

ANNE
Perhaps youre just polishing a stone
endowing this Elephant Man with
qualities he doesnt possess
Treves

the

open
tart
Merrick
making
then

door

TREVES
(impatiently)
And what qualities are those
Intelligence or stupidity

ANNE
(slightly hurt)
Im sure I dont know Freddie

She releases Treves and lies down Treves realizes that
perhaps he has been unkind

TREVES
Im sorry I dont know either I

just dont know

ANNE
Well these things take time

TREVES

Ive only got until two oclock

tomorrow afternoon when Carr Gomm

meets him Somehow between now and

then Ive got to make John Merrick

at least seem like an intelligent

man Why am I fooling myself

Nothing short of John delivering the

Sermon on the Mount is going to sway

Carr Gomm
Anne sits back up and gently places her hand over
mouth As she does so she leans forward and turns out
light
ISOLATION WARD
Merrick is propped up in bed Suddenly the door bursts
The Night Porter an arm around a drunken giggling
stands in the doorway As soon as the Charwoman sees
she screams as does Merrick and she wriggles free
for the stairs The Night Porter watches her go and

turns to Merrick laughing noisily He then pulls the

shut with a bang
Merrick very frightened crawls down into his hiding

place

BEDROOM (MORNING)

We see Anne alone in bed asleep Treves is finished
dressing

and leaves the room The sound of the door closing
awakens

Anne She looks around for Treves A clock reads 530
ISOLATION WARD
Merricks disguise hangs on the wall

MERRICK (VO)
The Lord is my shepherd I shall not
want he maketh me to lie down in
green pastures He leadeth me beside
still waters He restoreth my soul
He Guideth me in the paths of
righteousness

TREVES
Righteousness

MERRICK (VO)
Righteousness for his namesake

WE NOW SEE TREVES AND MERRICK

TREVES
Very good very good Now when your
visitor comes today I want you to
say it exactly the way you said it
just now I will introduce him to
you and you will say the words youve
learned If you have any trouble
with any of the words Ill help
you Im sure youll be just fine
If you do as well for him as youve
done for me these last two days
then Im sure our visitor will be
very pleased Now lets go through
the whole thing again shall we I
will say May I introduce you to Mr
Carr Gomm And you will say

MERRICK
Hello my name is John Merrick I am
very pleased to meet you
HALLWAY

Treves and Carr Gomm are speaking together as they walk
along

TREVES
Its only a physical problem He has
trouble with certain sounds because
of the constrictive deformity of the
mouth But he can talk and has a
great eagerness to make contact with
people who will let him So if you
have any difficulty understanding
what he is saying just tell me and
Ill make it clear

CARR
Speaking is one thing Treves but
can the man comprehend

Treves cannot easily answer this question

TREVES
As I said its only a physical
problem but I do feel that Mr
Merrick is very flattered that youre
taking the time and trouble to meet
him and hes most anxious to make a
good impression so he might seem
rather nervous

CARR
He neednt I have no desire to cause
him any discomfort Did you make
those inquiries we spoke about

TREVES
Yes I spoke to both the British
Home and Royal Hospital for
Incurables Im afraid that they
werent very encouraging but they
said theyd bring it up at their
next committee meeting so we should
have their answers shortly

CARR
Fine fine You know your dedication
to this patient is an inspiring thing
Treves But you must remember that
this is a hospital and there are
many patients here Patients who can
be made well and you owe them your

so obsessed old man that you begin

Carr Gomm starts up the stairs Treves remains behind
watching him for a moment then follows

ISOLATION WARD

Merrick is standing beside his disguise on its hook He
nervously smooths the cloak down repositions the Bible

the bedside table and smooths the cloak again He looks
the door expecting it to open It doesnt His hands
the cloak over and over again Voices can be heard

the door

Merrick freezes

There are two raps at the door Merrick flinches

the cloak The raps are repeated He pulls himself
and walks to the middle of the room He takes a deep
and closes his eyes

MERRICK
Come in

The door opens and Treves and Carr Gomm enter Carr
eyes are rivited on Merrick but he contains his shock
Merrick is breathing unevenly his eyes still closed
goes to him and touches his shoulder Merrick opens his
and looks up at Treves Treves turns to Carr Gomm as
Merrick Carr Gomm lowers his eyes
TREVES
John may I introduce you to Sir
Carr Gomm
MERRICK

Hello my name is John Merrick I
am very pleased to meet you
Carr Gomm still shaken instinctively offers his hand

CARR
Im very pleased to meet you

Before Carr Gomm can withdraw his hand Merrick grasps
it
with his left hand

There is an uncomfortable silence Merrick releases it
Carr
Gomn nervously clears his throat

CARR
How are you feeling today

MERRICK
I feel much better Thank you for
asking And you

CARR
Im feeling very fit thank you How
is your bronchitis

MERRICK
I feel much better Thank you

CARR
Are you comfortable here

MERRICK
Everyone has been very kind I am
extremely grateful

TREVES
Mr Merrick likes the food here
Dont you John

MERRICK
Oh yes It is much better than what
I am used to

CARR
Oh yes

TREVES
(after a pause)
And what was that John

MERRICK
Potatoes
There is another agonizing silence

TREVES
(to Carr Gomm)
Yes potatoes but

MERRICK
But the variety of food here is very
pleasing I commend you

CARR
(after a pause)
I understand that you were beaten

Merrick is at a loss This is not part of the expected
scenario

DIERRICK
Oh no everyone has been very kind

CARR
No I meant in your former situation

Merrick doesnt seem to understand

MERRICK
Im feeling much better now

Carr Gomm stares levelly at Treves for a moment then
asks
Merrick

CARR
Tell me how do you like Mr Treves
As a teacher

Treves stiffens

MERRICK
I everyone has been very kind
to me

CARR
Of course How long did you and Mr
Treves prepare for this interview

Merrick looks at Treves for guidance but Treves cannot
look

him in the eye

MERRICK
everyone has been very kind

CARR
Yes of course Well its been a
pleasure meeting you Mr Merrick
Good day
TREVES
(to John)

Thank you John You did very well

Treves and Carr Gomm go out the door onto the landing
Merrick

sees his chance escaping him and tries to recapture
their

attention

MERRICK

(his voice is gaining

strength)
The Lord is my shepherd I shall not
want He maketh me to lie down in
green pastures

(he continues through

the following dialogue)

Treves and Carr Gomm are alone on the landing speaking
quietly

CARR
It was a nice try Treves but the
man is so obviously mouthing your
words

TREVES
Yes Im very sorry to have wasted
your time sir I just felt that I
had to do anything I could to protect
him

CARR
Im sorry too He simply doesnt
belong here Hes be much happier
somewhere else where he could be
constantly looked after Believe me
Frederick its better that it worked
out this way Good day

Merrick has come to the end of what Treves taught him
to
say He makes one last desperate attempt to be heard
Treves disheartened stands on the landing as Carr
Gomm

starts down the stairs

MERRICK (VO)
(now full voice)
Yea though I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death I will fear
no evil for Thou art with me Thy
rod and Thy staff they comfort me

Treves is staring open-mouthed back into the room
Carr

Gomm looks up at him

CARR
What is it Treves

MERRICK (VO)
Thou preparest a table before me in
the presence of mine enemies Thou
anointest my head with oil

TREVES
I didnt teach him that part

Treves rushes back into the room followed by Carr
Gomm

MERRICK
My cup runneth over Surely goodness
and loving kindness shall follow me
all the days of my life and I shall
dwell in the house of the Lord
forever

There is a long silence as all three men stare at each
other

TREVES
How did you know the rest I never
taught you the rest of it

CARR
I dont understand

TREVES
Tell me John how did you know the
rest of the 23rd Psalm

MERRICK
(hesitantly)
opens

I I used to read the Bible every
day I know it very well The Bible
and the Book of Common Prayer The
23rd Psalm is very beautiful

ISOLATION WARD
A few minutes later We hear voices inside the room

CARR (VO)
It was a great pleasure to meet you
Mr Merrick

MERRICK
I am very pleased to meet you

CARR
I hope we can talk together again
sometime Good day

The door opens and Carr Gomm and Treves come out

TREVES
(to Merrick)
Ill be right back

He closes the door

CARR
I want to see you in my office as
soon as youre through up here Weve
a good deal to discuss

He starts down the stairs

TREVES
Of course sir Thank you thank you
very much

Carr Gomm stops on the stairs

CARR
Treves Well done

TREVES
Not me sir Mr Merrick He succeeded
in spite of my shortsightedness

ISOLATION WARD

Merrick is on the bed propped up by pillows The door
They

silently
quietly

never

Treves comes in

closes the door and walks to the window

look at each other for a moment

TREVES
Why did you let me go on like that
teaching you what you already knew
Why didnt you tell me you could
read

MERRICK
You did not ask me

TREVES
I never thought to ask How can you
ever forgive me

MERRICK
Oh no do not say that You have
been so kind to me I was afraid to
say too much People always want me
to be quiet You wanted me to speak
but I was afraid Forgive me

TREVES
We do have a lot to talk about dont
we

CARR GOMMS OFFICE
Carr Gomm is seated at the window looking out

There is a knock at the door and Treves enters

CARR
Can you imagine what his life has
been like

TREVES
Yes I think I can

CARR
No you cant You cant begin to
know no one can

Carr Gomm suddenly stands and faces Treves

CARR

shuts the door and leans against it

He

Carr Gomm
day
room
over

and

Merrick looks up at her very apprehensively

You are quite right Treves this is
an exceptional case And I quite
agree that the committee should see
Mr Merrick

TREVES
I could easily arrange

CARR
No not that way Broadneck and the
others dont like to deal with
patients directly It makes them
queasy Do you have any photographs
of Mr Merrick

TREVES
Well yes

CARR
Excellent We shall present them
along with the other particulars of
the case to the committee I want
them to see exactly how horribly
his body has been affected You and

I shall vouch for his inner qualities

TREVES
Do you think theyll go along with
us

CARR
Of course they will Theyre
reasonable men

ISOLATION WARD

to the bed picks up the Bible from the table

hands it to Merrick

MOTHERSHEAD
Read it

Merrick looks down at the Bible

MERRICK

Merrick is in bed very tired Its been an exhausting
Suddenly the door opens and Mothershead comes into the

Thou heardest my voice hide not

stares at Merrick for a moment

MOTHERSHEAD

Credit where credit is due Youll

breakfast
She quickly turns and exits Merrick looks down at the
It is open to Lamentations

HALLWAY - THE LONDON (NIGHT)

As before the lights are going off in one hallway after
another The hallways are empty dark and silent We

the great iron door close with a bang
ISOLATION WARD (NIGHT)
Merrick is in his bed as always He holds the portrait
the beautiful woman gazing at it longingly He hears a
close far away in the silence of the hospital
Suddenly we hear the heavy footfalls of the Night
boots As they get louder and louder we move slowly
to Merricks face
The sound is very close now and Merricks eyes are
agitated
Finally the door bursts open and the Night Porter is
there He stares malevolently at Merrick for a long
and then walks to him menacingly

NIGHT PORTER

I hear you have some trouble
sleepin
He grabs Merrick fiercely by the hair and jerks his

head
back Merrick immediately starts to wheeze and gasp
NIGHT PORTER
Heads too heavy eh
He pulls Merrick all the way down onto the bed so that
he

is prone struggling for breath

NIGHT PORTER
And I heard a nasty rumor about you
I heard you can talk but you cant

can you can you can you
MERRICK
(struggling)
Noooo

The Night Porter is as first surprised and then
pleased at
the desperate sound

NIGHT PORTER
No No you cant One word about
me out of that stinking cakehole
Just ONE word and youll have no
trouble at sleepin no trouble at
all You understand me Do you

MERRICK
(croaking)

Yyyesss

Satisfied the Night Porter rights Merrick who is just

able

to catch his breath The Night Porter smiles and pats
Merrick

on the shoulder

NIGHT PORTER
There now thats better in it

HALLWAY

Treves and Carr Gomm are on their way to the committee

meeting confident of their position Treves is holding
a

folder and Carr Gomm is looking at the photographs of
Merrick
CARR
As far as I can see the only obstacle
might be Broadneck He has enormous
influence over the others very old
school not an easy man to impress
In any case if worse does come to
worse we still have the British and
Royal Homes to fall back on dont
we

Treves is silent They stop

CARR
Dont we

TREVES
No we dont Their committees have
informed me that theyre unwilling
to take Mr Merrick even if they
were supplied with funds They dont
want him

CARR
Well its up to us then isnt it

They continue walking

CARR
Dont worry Treves well make them
see it our way

He looks at the pictures

CARR
Theyve eyes havent they

They go through a door marked Committee Room
COMMITTEE ROOM - THE LONDON HOSPITAL

We see a pair of hands One of the photographs of
Merrick is
passed to them

They hold it for a moment then lay it down flat on the
table

One of the hands covers the photograph with a piece of
paper

TREVES (V0O)
Due to the progressive nature of
the disease I feel sure that the
pinched

with disgust He sniffs

patient does not have much longer to
live

We pan up from the hands to see BROADNECK his face

TREVES
Forgive the redundancy gentlemen
but there is no other place for him
Both the Royal Hospital and the
British Home have turned him down
even if sufficient funds for his
care were provided The workhouse is
certainly out of the question The
patient has an overwhelming fear of
returning to the horrors of his past
His appearance is so disturbing that
all shrink from him He cannot in
justice to others be put in the
general ward of the workhouse The
police rightly prevent his being
exhibited and he is mobbed in the
streets wherever he goes What is to
be done with him

BROADNECK
I for one am sick and tired of
this competitive freak-hunting by
these overly ambitious young doctors
trying to make names for themselves
To parade then about in front of the
pathological society is one thing
but to waste this committees valuable
time with requests for shelter for
these abominations of nature is quite
another

TREVES
Gentlemen John Merrick is not an
animal he is a man fully aware of
his condition An intelligent
sensitive literate man with an
intimate knowledge of the Bible His
horrible infirmities do not reduce
him to anything less than what he
is a man and it would be criminal
if we of the London Hospital his
final refuge the last place on earth
where this man can find peace were
to cast him out

and gazes coolly at Treves
gavel

hands

Gomm

Carr Gomm

Carr Gomm

Broadneck

One of the committee members says I quite agree

from his chair on the committee pounds his

CARR
Gentlemen may I make a suggestion

There are two small rooms off Bedstead

Square that are no longer in use and
would be admirably suited to Mr
Merricks needs I also propose to

write a letter to The Times appealing

to their readers for assistance
Knowing the generosity of the British
public I feel we would have little
trouble in raising the funds for his
maintenance Indeed this hospitals
rules do preclude the admission of
incurables but if ever there was an
exception to the rule it is this
patient So therefore I propose if
Mr Treves is finished that we put
it to a vote All those in favor of
keeping Mr Merrick here

and another committee member raise their

is displeased

BROADNECK
One moment
(showing the picture
of Merrick)
as far as Im concerned this creature

has no business being in our hospital

I think Mr Carr Gomms letter would
be an excellent idea

(to Carr Gomm)
and when you appeal for funds I
think you should appeal for a more
appropriate place for him as well I
agree the British public is generous
and Im sure that somewhere the
creature will find a happy and
permanent home but not here

scowls a bit

CARR
I see All then that move we keep
Mr Merrick here

Carr

ashamed

Broadneck

raises his hand None of the others do

exchange hopeless glances Carr Gomm looks at

CARR
All those opposed

and the rest raise their hands

CARR
I see

BROADNECK
(triumphantly)

Well then In the meantime of course
he neednt be turned out He may

stay in the rooms off Bedstead Square
until such time as more suitable
arrangements can be made thus freeing
the Isolation Ward for more deserving

patients Well then Mr Chairman
if there is nothing further to
discuss I move that we adjourn this
meeting and all go bout our normal

business

Carr Gomm cannot conceal his contempt

CARR

I second the motion gentlemen This

meeting is adjourned

The others cough their agreement and hurriedly leave

room Treves walks over to the committee table and

paper off the photograph He stares sadly at Merricks

picture

CARR (VO)

Somehow I dont think they quite

understand

for quiet and privacy during a life
which Mr Treves assures me is not
likely to be long

There is a short pause

4 DOCTOR
The Elephant Man Makes you sound
rather more like a zoo-keeper than a
surgeon Frederick

The group again laughs Treves clears his throat and
rises

TREVES
Excuse me gentlemen I seem to have
lost my appetite Good evening

Treves leaves the room

4 DOCTOR
I say whats he on about

3 DOCTOR
Hes getting a bit of a swelled head
if you ask me

FOX

(coldly)
Well no one did ask you Atkins
Frederick Treves is not only the
most skillful surgical operator here
hes also a humanitarian of the
highest order You sound like a pack
of whining school boys with your
petty jealousies

3 DOCTOR
Look here Fox I simply said

FOX
Oh belt up

A deep silence falls over the Doctors

crowd

As they welcome him he slaps down The Times on the bar

counter for all to see

NIGHT PORTER

letter to THE London Times from the
guvnor of the hospital

(starts to read)
There is now in a little room off
one of our attic wards a man named
John Merrick so dreadful a sight
that he is unable even to come out
by daylight to the garden He has
been called The Elephant Man on
account of his terrible deformity

The Night Porter has the undivided attention of the
people
in the pub

NIGHT PORTER
His appearance is so terrible
that woman and nervous persons fly
in terror at the sight of him
(pauses)
and guess who can get you tickets
to see him Your own Sunny Jim

YOUNG MAN IN CROWD
Lets go see him then

NIGHT PORTER

Keep your shirts on

(shaking his finger

at them)
When the time is right Right now

movin him into Bedstead Square

Merrick inspects his new home He seems pleased-by the
bathtub by the table by the window to the outside
Merrick pulls the curtain aside and opens the window

him beyond the hospital fence the spire of St

Cathedral stands resplendently in the morning light

MERRICK
When Im next moved may I go to a
lighthouse or to a blind-asylum

There is no one in the room The bathroom door opens
Nora and another nurse enter carrying buckets which
set down by the hall door They straighten up and lean
against it

Mrs Mothershead enters from the bathroom speaking
shoulder to Merrick

MOTHERSHEAD

duties over to you girls now Mr
Merrick will require a bath every
day that way he wont pong quite
so much Nora you can instruct
Kathleen on the finer points of Mr
Merricks bath Youll be on your

Mothershead starts to exit

MOTHERSHEAD
Oh and girls under no circumstances

into this room

She exits

KATHLEEN

Merrick quietly enters the room dressed in a billowy
white

shirt and baggy black pants The two nurses try to
smile

but he cannot look at them

NORA

Kathleens eyes go wide at the sound

NORA

Merrick looks down at himself

MERRICK

MERRICK

TREVES
Good morning John

MERRICK
Good morning

TREVES
John theres someone here who would
like to meet you Would that be
alright

Merrick is a trifle apprehensive but he agrees Treves
MRS KENDAL through the door At the sight of her
eyes go wide

TREVES
John Id like you to meet one of
the brightest lights of the British
stage Mrs Kendal Mrs Kendal
John Merrick

KENDAL
Good day Mr Merrick

MERRICK
Good day

KENDAL
Ive brought you some things I hope
youll like Mr Merrick I hope you
dont think it too forward

MERRICK
Oh no
KENDAL
I knew youd understand Here

She-hands Merrick a nicely framed picture of herself
Merrick
is speechless overjoyed by the gift

KENDAL
I want you to know that I dont go
about giving my pictures to just
anyone

MERRICK
Oh no I would never think it Its
so beautiful You are so Ill
give it a place of honor here next
to my mother

He places it with great care next to his mothers
portrait

KENDAL
Shes very pretty your mother

MERRICK
Yes

Treves smiles at them

Merrick is a trifle nervous but Mrs Kendal smiles at
him
and he relaxes a little

MERRICK
Mr Treves says that you are in the
theatre Do you live there

KENDAL
Oh no Mr Merrick I just work there

MERRICK
Well even to work there would be
wonderful Is it beautiful

KENDAL
Youve never been

MERRICK
Alas no

KENDAL
Well you must go It is one of the
most beautiful places on earth Of
course Im rather partial

MERRICK
Tell me about it please

KENDAL
Its very difficult to put into a
nutshell but I should say the theater
is the shrine of the imagination
where one may suspend disbelief and
travel anywhere in the world to any
time you desire You may look over
the shoulders of kings unobserved
battle with ruthless tyrants and
marry the beautiful princess all in
the space of a few hours Onstage
you may be whoever you wish to be
do anything you please and always
always live happily ever after The
theatre is all the brightest and
best things of the world Mr Merrick
It is lights and music gaiety and

joy Its well its romance
MERRICK
(the magic word)
Romance
KENDAL

Thats one thing the theatre has in
great store which reminds me I
have something else for you

She produces a beautiful leather-bound volume of
Shakespeares

works Merrick takes it with reverence and begins to
leaf

through it

KENDAL
Have you read it

MERRICK
No but I certainly shall

Merrick finds a place and begins to read

MERRICK
Romeo and Juliet I know of this
If I profane with my unworthiest
hand This holy shrine the gentle
fine is this My lips two blushing
pilgrims ready stand To smooth
that rough touch with a tender kiss

Merrick embarrassed by these last words starts to
close
the book

Mrs Kendal knows Juliets lines by heart She looks at
Merrick for a moment then replies tenderly

KENDAL
Good pilgrim you do wrong your hand
too much Which mannerly devotion
shows in this For saints have hands
that pilgrims hands do touch And
palm to palm is holy palmers kiss

Merrick pauses looking at Kendal then continues

MERRICK
Have not saints lips and holy palmers
too

KENDAL
Ay pilgrim lips that they must use
in prayer

MERRICK
O then dear saint let lips do
what hands do They pray grant thou
lest faith turn to despair

They both look at each other for a long silent moment
Treves
is touched and amazed

KENDAL
Why Mr Merrick youre not an
Elephant Man at all

MERRICK
Oh no
KENDAL
Oh no no youre a Romeo

The London the other afternoon No
dear readers the most facile actress
of our day has not been taken ill
but rather said she was visiting a
friend And who was the lucky
recipient of this attention Quick
enquiries proved it to be none other
than Mr John Merrick The Elephant
Man with whom our readers are
undoubtedly familiar After a chat
of three-quarters of an hour Mrs
Kendal was kind enough to leave Mr
Merrick with an autographed portrait
of herself Owing to a disfigurement
of the most extreme nature Mr
Merrick has never been properly
presented to London society But
knowing that wherever Mrs Kendal
goes others inevitably follow the
questions arises Will London society
present itself to him

people outside the hospital

MOTHERSHEAD
But you saw them sir They couldnt
hide their disgust They dont care
anything for John theyre just trying
to impress their friends

TREVES
Arent you being just a little harsh
Mothershead You yourself hardly
treated John with much loving kindness
when he first arrived

MOTHERSHEAD
I bathed him didnt I I fed him

We pan across Merricks bookcase now quite full and

a few titles Moll Flanders Emma Jane Eyre

together

MERRICK

When will the stream be aweary of
flowing under my eye

When will the wind be aweary of
blowing over the sky

When will the clouds be aweary of
fleeting
When will the heart be aweary of
beating and nature die

TREVES
Never oh Never nothing will die
the stream flows the wind blows the
heart beats Nothing will die

TREVES
No John I cant I can care for

you but I cant cure you

MERRICK
I thought as much

Merrick rises Treves ponders over what Merrick has
said He looks at Merrick and something very odd
Merrick is looking levelly at him

For the first and only time we see expression on his
It is a calm knowing look almost a benign smile At
very moment there is a bright flash of light behind
head seemingly from the window Treves blinks unable
comprehend what has just happened When he looks again
moment has passed Merrick his back to Treves moves
bookcase to replace the volume

TREVES
John

Theres a knock at the door

MERRICK
Come in

Nora enters with a brown paper parcel tied with string
Merrick says nothing

TREVES
Are you looking for me Sister
NORA
No sir Mr Merrick
(to Merrick)
I have something for you

She puts the parcel on the table and opens it We see

several
squares of new cardboard a cutting knife a pastepot
and a
few brushes and some paint
NORA
I thought these things would be
helpful with your cathedral
Merrick examines the materials with reverence and
thanks
her profusely
Treves is moved and a little disconcerted Merrick lays
the
things aside carefully and begins to pull the crude
spires
from the discarded box Nora smiles at the busy Merrick
and

exits

TREVES
The cathedral is coming along nicely

MERRICK
(bending over the
model)
Yes soon I will start the main spire

Treves notices to his dismay that the growths on
Merricks
head are larger

He finds it very difficult to disguise his concern

Merrick is silent He goes over to his cloak reaches
it and pulls out a folded up advertisement He hands it
Treves who examines it closely It is an advertisement
an-elegant gentlemans dressing bag boasting ivory
silver fittings and Moroccan silk lining

TREVES

them

into a box Treves looks troubled He takes one from
the

pile and examines it Its a copy of Frankenstein

TREVES

ANNE

Oh thats absurd Frederick No no
Frederick thats all wrong John is
happier and more fulfilled now than
he has ever been in his entire life

comfort Or so I could become famous

ANNE

TREVES
Am I a good man or am I a bad
man

ANNE

Oh Frederick
She holds him in her arms

ANNE
Youre a good man A very good man

We see from Treves eyes that he is not reassured
BASEMENT - THE LONDON

It is very dark There is a dim red glow coming from

the

holes in a furnace door We hear a door open and
footsteps

coming downstairs A man comes into the basement
carrying

something large and black He approaches the furnace
and

opens the door

The man is Treves He is holding the stiff black
surgeons

coat of which he was once so proud He looks at it for
a

moment and then stuffs it into the furnace Inside
the

coat starts to smoke heavily then bursts into flames

Treves watches it burn and then closes the door
HALLWAY - THE LONDON HOSPITAL

We see Carr Gomm walking down the hall to his office
Broadneck appears going the other way

CARR
Ahh Broadneck Youll no doubt be
pleased to know that weve received
a smashing response to my letter
Its all very heartwarming though
several letters do mention how beastly
it would be to part the poor fellow
from Mr Treves and the staff but
since the committee insists

BROADNECK

We see in a pair of hands holding a buff colored

hall to a door where one of the hands knocks next to
FC Carr Gomm sign then enters the office

Carr Gomm and Mothershead look up to see a porter with

COMMITTEE ROOM - THE LONDON

Broadneck and the other committee members are seated at
table anxious to get the meeting underway They talk

themselves
The door opens and Carr Gomm and Treves enter Treves

seems
quite nervous but Carr Gomm is relaxed and smiling
TREVES
Dont you think this is a bit
premature We dont have the backing
yet to
CARR
Steady on Treves Have a seat
Treves sits and Carr Gomm takes his place at the head
of the
table and raps his gavel
CARR
Gentlemen I know we begin every
meeting by reading the minutes but
in the interest of speed I think we
should conclude a matter discussed
previously to wit that of Mr John
Merrick the Elephant Man
Broadneck explodes to his feet Carr Gomm smiles at
Treves
who looks quite grim
CARR
Mr Broadneck
BROADNECK
Mr Chairman I was under the distinct
impression that we had concluded
discussion of this disagreeable
matter Had we not ascertained that
an Elephant Man is not acceptable as
a patient Have we not very
generously allowed the creature to
use two of our rooms until such time
as he could be properly disposed of
Have we not

Merrick is working on his cathedral painting details
with a

very fine brush

As he lifts the brush from the paint jar a drop falls

up the spilled paint with a cloth

MERRICK
I must be more careful

CuT TO COMMITTEE ROOM

BROADNECK
Which brings to mind my next point
The rules gentlemen the rules In
a society such as ours it is of
paramount importance that we not
stray from the established order
Has that order not already been
fearfully strained by allowing this
this sideshow exhibit to take up
residence however temporary in two
very useful rooms the purpose of
which would be far better served in
accommodating treatable patients
patients to whom this hospital was
originally dedicated I believe we
have a duty

Carr Gomm still smiles Treves is about to spring to
defense but Carr Gomm catches his eyes and motions for
to remain silent Treves is perplexed Carr Gomm checks
pocket watch
CUT TO MERRICKS ROOM
Merrick as before busily working away We see a
crawling slowly across the roof of the cathedral
notices it and watches for a moment then reaches up
lays a finger alongside the bug The bug crawls onto
finger and Merrick holds it closer to him
MERRICK
Ladybug ladybug fly away home
its cloudy out I know but remember

behind the clouds there is always
the sun
CUT TO WHITECHAPEL ROAD

We see a Royal carriage glide to a stop in front of the

hospital A footman jumps down and opens the door A
very

elegantly dressed woman begins to emerge

CUT TO COMMITTEE ROOM
Broadneck is still talking

BROADNECK
In light of these facts our course
is clear The question is not whether
to accept this creature as a patient
the question is when will those rooms
be vacated for use by better
qualified more deserving cases I
move that this Elephant Man be removed
from the premises immediately We
have a sacred duty to cure the sick
not care for circus animals That is
my last word on the subject Mr
Chairman shall we vote

Broadneck turns to Carr Gomm Carr Gomm checks his
watch and
clears his throat

CARR GOMM
I take it Mr Broadneck that your
mind is fixed on this matter

Broadneck blusters with rage
BROADNECK
Mr Chairman Dont you have ears I

am unalterably opposed to any

Carr Gomm smiles and again checks his watch Treves is

very

nervous

We see two nurses their backs to us walking down the
hall

They start to go in a doorway when they stop suddenly

startled and curtsey deeply

BROADNECK
-No my mind is made up on this
and I am resolved to stand firm You
shall not sway me May we now vote
Mr Chairman at long last

Carr Gomm checks his watch The door to the room begins
open He smiles

CARR
Yes I believe that time has come

The two footmen enter the room

1ST FOOTMAN
Gentlemen Her Royal Highness
Alexandra Princess of Wales

The elegantly dressed woman enters Everyone rises

ALIX
Good morning gentlemen I hope I am
not interrupting

CARR

Indeed not your Highness Your
presence is always greatly
appreciated We were just about to
put the matter of Mr Merrick to a
vote

(he turns to the other

committee members)
The Princess is very interested in
Mr Merricks fate

ALIX
Indeed I am sir as is the Queen
I have a brief communication from
her Highness which she has requested
I read to you To the Governing
Committee London Hospital I would
very much like to commend you for
the charitable face you have shown
Mr John Merrick the Elephant Man
It is laudable that you have provided
one of Englands most unfortunate
sons with a safe and tranquil harbour
a home For this immeasurable
kindness as well as the many other
acts of mercy on behalf of the poor
of which Mr Carr Gomm has kept me
informed I gratefully thank you
Signed Victoria Empress of India
Queen of the United Kingdom of Great
Britain and Ireland

(looking straight at

Broadneck)
I am sure you gentlemen may be counted
on to do the Christian thing

Alix seats herself

CARR
Thank you very much your Highness
you may be sure we shall

Broadneck seems very unnerved

CARR
Well then I move that Mr John
Merrick be admitted to the London
Hospital on a permanent basis on
condition that the Hospital shall
receive a yearly payment equal to
the cost of occupying one bed and
that the funds for his care shall be
clearly separate from hospital funds
All those in favor

Carr Gomm raises his hand The other members puzzled

look

at Broadneck

Quite red in the face Broadneck looks at Carr Gomm
then to

Treves then to the Princess He seems to almost
deflate

then slowly raises his hand The other members now
thoroughly

confused raise their hands as well Carr Gomm bangs
his

gavel smiling broadly Treves is almost beside himself
with

happiness and the Princess is obviously very pleased
finished

Carr

CARR
The motion is carried

Broadneck humiliated cannot look at anyone

CARR
Well now we may go about our normal
business

stonework There is a knock at the door

CARR

OPERATING THEATRE

The Night Porter is adding fresh coal to the operating
stove The old coals were still quite hot and now smoke

OUTSIDE THE SHOP (DAY)

Treves is standing in the street looking at the now

circle in the glass He peers in

From inside through the smeared dirty window we see

distorted face
CARR (VO THROUGHOUT)
Id like to think I felt no less for

FADE TO

INSIDE A WAGON
A moving circle of light in blackness

As we move closer to the light it becomes
distinguishable

as a peephole in the side of a wagon Through the
peephole

we see a dark overcast sky It is dusk We move even
closer

to the hole Just beside it we see the head of a horse
with

blinders on moving alongside We move closer still to
see

its rider a policeman He notices the peephole and
leans

forward in the saddle looking in

From outside we see the peephole and an eye gazing
out The

eye is replaced by a plug

The policeman starts back and pulls up on the reins As
he

falls behind we see the portrait of the EM from the
front

of the shop in London on the back of the wagon The
policeman

looks at the poster The wagon moves on out of frame
and the

policeman slows his horse to a stop

down the road

Bytes and the boy are riding along the road Bytes

his seat and opens a hatch in the roof He looks down

Inside the wagon lit by the last dregs of the sunset
Merrick huddled in his sleeping posture He feels the
and looks up weakly wheezing obviously very sick A
bowl of potatoes sets untouched beside him

Still havent eaten eh

MERRICK

He snaps the hatch shut and turns forward muttering to
himself

FIELD and ROAD (MORNING)

We see a field with a road in the distance leading to
It is misty the sun barely peeking through the rolling

ANOTHER DWARF comes up to the two other Freaks and

are little stalls and cages containing two mangey
some screeching spider monkeys and some squawking

The circus is abustle in the drab grey field

CLOSE-UP of the Pinhead jumping up and down in her

There is a clap of thunder

A rainstorm over the freak show We pass along the row
freak wagons

These freaks truly deserve the name They are quite

fate of John Merricks Mother on that African Isle so
years ago A very big crowd is listening to him They

looking at the poster at the back of the wagon waiting
impatiently to see the Elephant Man

He raps twice with Merricks silver-tipped walking

wagon He is quite sick The audience gasps and
few shrieks are heard The Elephant Man is always the
Man

Merrick slowly turns around the audience gasping at
sight of the horrible tumors Bytes raps the walking

Merrick groans with pain and some of the people in the
row flinch back

Merrick begins to dance again as people throw coins

THE BACK OF THE WAGON - DAY

The poster is rolled up Merrick on the floor of the

Beside him on the floor is a bowl of what looks to be

splattering in Merricks face He stands for a moment

down at Merrick who has lapsed into a coughing fit

SIDE OF THE WAGON - DAY

There is a small crowd gathered in a circle on the
Merrick stands amidst them on a small wooden stool
jabbing him from behind again

Merrick is making a strange moaning cry slightly

of the trumpet of an elephant The boy is passing

his elephant call

Merricks eyes look painfully up to the heavens and he

SMALL CIRCLE OF WAGONS (NIGHT)
Bytes is seated by a campfire drinking from a bottle of

He is very drunk From the wagon behind him we can hear
Merrick coughing and wheezing

We also hear the boy almost pleading with Merrick to
coughing and to try to eat As Bytes listens he gets

and angrier Finally he rises clumsily to his feet and
stumbles over to the back of the wagon

BYTES
Another bleedin heart

The boy is crouched over Merrick who looks little

than a corpse
Bytes points a menacing finger at Merrick

BYTES
You sly bastard Youre doing this
to spite me arent you

BOY

He reaches in and grabs Merrick roughly by his arm
dragging
him out of the wagon

BOY
What are you going to do

He drags Merrick across the way to a small monkey
wagon The
boy follows his face filled with sympathy for Merrick

The boy looks to Merrick who is in a panic trying to
himself away from the monkeys who scream loudly in all
excitement We hear Bytes cursing to himself in the
The boy frightened goes to the fire and pulls a
around him

Merrick crawls to one corner of the cage away from the
screaming monkeys

Suddenly one of the braver ones leaps at Merrick with a
scream biting him on the arm and moving quickly away
Merrick yelps with pain and struggles to move away The
monkeys have gotten the idea now and they begin to move

toward Merrick screeching threateningly Another leaps

and clings to Merricks shoulder biting and scratching
furiously then he too jumps away

Merrick cries out

Now the monkeys are getting braver and more and more of

The monkeys strive to pull him down Merrick looks

MERRICK
Bytes Bytes please

But Bytes wont come Something is happening inside
A wave of feeling is growing coming from a place in
very deep down and far away
This feeling seems to give him strength and he is able
pull himself all the way up in spite of the hairy
mass that now seems to cling to every part of his body
The feeling is surging up inside Merrick making his
shake uncontrollably as if he were a volcano about to
The monkeys keep on biting and screeching pulling at
Suddenly a formidable cry rings out of Merricks mouth
a power and assurance we have never heard from him
He whirls about and cries out again a shattering No
force of which scatters most of the monkeys away from
onto the cage floor dumbfounded
Merrick grabs a monkey who has managed to hang and
into the group of monkeys on the floor
MERRICK

NO I AM NOT AN ELEPHANT I AM NOT

THE SILENT FACES OF THE MONKEYS

We now see Merrick crouched in a corner of the cage in
sleeping position

We see the monkeys again and hear whispering in the
night CU of merricks head resting on his knees The
whispering continues and a shadow falls across Merrick
Merrick begins to stir his head comes up and he looks

around The whispering stops

We pull back to see some of the freaks from the circus
gathered around the monkey cage in a small group They

him The dwarf speaks to the others again and the lion-
man and the armless wonder move to each side of
lion-faced man pulls Merricks right arm over his
Merrick puts his left arm around the armless wonder
PLUMED DWARF
Weve decided Youve got to get
away from here
He and the other dwarf light two lanterns and they
move off
The boy by the wagon has awakened He sees the small
of freaks moving in the darkness the light from the
bobbing over the grass His first instinct is to call
Bytes which he almost does but then he thinks better
it He rises and goes to where Bytes threw Merricks
and disguise
He nicks them up and goes to the small band of
shaped beings They stop and watch him warily

The small band moves away through the wagons The boy

looks to the wagon the poster of the Elephant Man and
dying fire He moves to the fire quickly collecting a
blankets and belongings Then taking one last look at
garish poster just visible in the night he runs off

WOODS - NIGHT

We see the beams of the lanterns moving through the
like will-o-the-wisps

They help Merrick along the plumed Dwarf directing
from time to time As they move along we see them pass

small still pond

DIRT ROAD - NIGHT

The intrepid freaks approach a bend in the road They
around the corner and before them stands a small train
station a train sitting amongst the steam by a

platform
The freaks stop just outside the light of the station
and
the plumed Dwarfs instruction get Merrick into his
disguise
The female pinhead who has carried his stick hands it
to
Merrick squeezing his hand
MERRICK
Thank you my friends
The plumed Dwarf relays the message and the freaks
respond
to Merrick in their language
PLUMED DWARF
Ill go in with you youll need a
ticket
He turns and confers with the freaks who all rifle
through
their pockets and produce some coins Then he and
Merrick

walk into the station the freaks watching and waving

ON THE PLATFORM

The train is about to leave At a barrier two ticket

collectors are taking tickets of a few last-minute
passengers

who hurry off

The Plumed Dwarf and Merrick appear and walk to the

barrier
The Plumed Dwarf hands over the ticket
PLUMED DWARF
Im just going to help my friend on
board
They walk off down the platform The collectors stare
after
them
The Plumed Dwarf his arm around Merrick is helping
him
down the platform as fast as possible his ark
trailing

behind him As they pass the windows of the first-class
carriages we see the ornate interiors and the happy

handsome
people on their plush seats
The Plumed Dwarf finds an empty compartment and opens
the
door
PLUMED DWARF
Thisll do
He looks down the platform The Ticket Collectors are
watching
them with great interest
Merrick climbs laboriously aboard
The other people on board see Merrick react and move
away
from him as far as they can in the cramped 3rd class
carriage
The Plumed Dwarf notices this and sniffs at the people
with
contempt
PLUMED DWARF
Im sorry I could only get you a
third class ticket but its all we
had
MERRICK
Oh no my friend
PLUMED DWARF

THIRD CLASS CARRIAGE - INTERIOR

Merrick is in the corner facing into the carriage He

The other passengers have moved away forming almost a

of space around him We see the whole carriage now the

Fair Katharine and most fair will
you vouchsafe to teach a soldier
terms
Such as will enter at a ladys ear
And plead his love-suit to her gentle
heart

KATH
Your majesty shall mock at me I
cannot speak your England

K HEN
O fair Katharine if you will love
me soundly with your French heart I
will be glad to hear you confess it
brokenly with your English tongue
Do you like me Kate

KATH
Pardonnez-moi I cannot tell vat is
like me

K HEN

An angel is like you Kate and you
are like an angel

KATH
O bon Dieu les langues des hommes
sont pleines de tramperies

K HEN
What say you fair one That the
tongues of men are full of deceits

KATH
Oui dat de tongues of de mans is be
full of deceits

K HEN
I know no way to mince it in love
but directly to say I love you
What A speaker is but a prater a
rhyme is but a ballad A good leg
will fall a straight back will stoop
a black beard will turn white a
curld pate will grow bald a fair
face will wither a full eye will
wax hollow but a good heart Kate
is the sun and the moon or rather
the sun and not the moon for it
shines bright and never changes but
keeps his course truly

THE STAGE

The chorus steps out to give the epilogue

CHORUS
Thus far with rough and allunable
pen
Our bending author hath pursued the
story

In little room confining mighty men
Mangling by starts the full course
of their glory

Small time but in that small most
greatly livd

This star of England Fortune made
his sword

By which the worlds best garden he
achievd

During the above the CAMERA moves in on John
Amidst great applause the curtain rings down Through
curtain comes Mrs Kendal to renewed applause She

You too my friend Goodnight
Treves smiles at John then walks down the darkened
Merrick watches him for a moment then slowly shuts the
We hear the distant echo of Treves footsteps Merrick
back to examine his cathedral looking at it from
angles He picks up a fine brush dipping it into the
and makes a few final brush strokes
He moves back into the middle of the room and gazes at
for a long time He lowers the brush to his side

MERRICK
It is finished

The cathedral is a masterwork of detail and shading as
it were St Philips itself shrunk to a miniature He
the table dips the brush into the paint and carefully
his name at the base of the main spire

MERRICK
John Merrick

He sighs deeply lays the brush down on the table and
the model towards the window The movement causes him
He puts his left hand up and feels the back of his
Merrick turns out the lamp and goes to his bed He

the cathedral again then around at his room We see in

dim light his books his gallery of smiling women his
dressing bag his cloak and hood and finally his

High altitude roiling clouds with lightning flashes
low thunder The sky is in turmoil
MERRICK (VO)
When will the stream be aweary of
flowing under my eye
Lightning flash thunder roll The clouds are
scattering
MERRICK (VO)
When will the wind be aweary of
blowing over the sky
The clouds erupt pushed onward and onward they
begin to calm as they turn slowly into elephants
trunk to tail moving slowly away from us
MERRICK (VO)
When will the clouds be aweary of
fleeting
The elephants are calmer than the skies we saw they
moving onward and onward
MERRICK (VO)
When will the heart be aweary of
beating
A lacy curtain has taken the place of the sky The

seem to be moving on it into the distance

MERRICK (VO)
and nature die

Knock knock sound The curtain moves to one side
elephants away with it There is no terrified audience
the curtain There is only light and Merricks Mother
a calm and benign smile

JOHNS MUM

Never oh Never nothing will die
the stream flows the wind blows
the cloud fleets the heart beats

The light grows brighter and brighter until we cannot

see
Johns Mother anymore It almost blinds us

Nothing will die
