REVEAL THE EYES OF A YOUNG BOY

INT TENEMENT FLAT - NIGHT

He’s ten years old crouching in a tiny apartment gazing at --

A WOMAN 26 applying the symbols of her sex lipstick powder on
face and cleavage garter belt clipped to stockings

She spots the Boy in her mirror Rises comes towards hin

WOMAN
(French accent)
What do you look at Don‘t you see the time

an BOY-- -- Lone
I’m sorry Mama

YANKS him up onto his tiptoes by his hair

MOTHER
How many times do I have to tell you Once
(slaps him once)
Twice
(slaps him twice)
Get that ugly face out of here before -

A KNOCK at the door Too late

MOTHER
(to door)
Darling just a moment

Drags the boy by his hair across the flat towards an armoire

MOTHER
You are a horror sent by the devil to
destroy my life

BOY
Mama who is he

MOTHER
A man as high as your father was low Who
wants to give me the life I deserve

WHIPS open the closet doors SHOVES the boy inside Picks up a
shoe WHACKS him across the head and face

MOTHER
Don‘t scream You sneeze -- breathe -- if
you let him know you even exist I swear I
will kill you

She slams the door STAY with him in the dark Hears the front
door open his mother’s melodious voice -- a different person

MOTHER (0S)
Darling look at your face the world
is hard on you today isn’t it Come I know
how to make you better Come to Mama

ON the boy as A SINGLE SHAFT OF LIGHT CUTS into his cramped
prison A knot in the wooden doors Slowly he brings his eye
up to the peephole

THE BOY WATCHES

Unable to tear his gaze away CLOSE on his eye illuminated by
that single light As it begins to TWITCH

great day for us all

EXT WILLIAMSBURG BRIDGE CONSTRUCTION SITE - NIGHT

Wind Cold Dark The same scaffoldings we‘’ve seen before
COPS milling around a crime scene Suddenly become alert

Roosevelt PUSHES his way through them onto the scaffolding of the
bridge in progress Without breaking stride he shakes the hand
of LT CMNDR FLYNN -- 30’s lanky and condescending

FLYNN
It’s a routine case sir No reason for you
to leave the ball
ROOSEVELT
You’ll be seeing a great deal of this face in
the days to come Lieutenant I suggest you
get used to it

Three REPORTERS approach In the lead JOHN MOORE Weather-worn
face once handsome Needs a shave overcoat could use a wash

MOORE
Commissioner Roosevelt John Schuyler Moore -
New York Times

MOORE flashes an ID card Roosevelt takes it from him

ROOSEVELT
This expired five years ago

Roosevelt hands it back plows forward Other two Reporters
JAKE RIIS and LINK STEFFENS flanking hin

JAKE RIIS
Moore’s a bottom-feeder sir Comes sniffing
round for scraps the rest of us leave behind

LINK STEFFENS

root out graft and corruption in the -

MOORE
(breaks around front)
I’m a stringer Commissioner These boys
won’t print what really goes on in this city
If you want to change the way things are run
you’1 talk to me

JAKE RIIS
Don’t waste your time with him Commissioner
122394 5

LINK STEFFENS
He’s living proof that rich parents and a
fancy education don’t mean you’ll amount to
anything

Flynn turns stops the reporters

FLYNN
That’s enough that’s as far as you go

Roosevelt enters the ring of cops surrounding the scene Looking
down on a girder several dozen feet below a corpse Long
blonde hair Wrists hog-tied to ankles A floral-print dress
Cops place the corpse on a wooden platform haul it up on ropes

Roosevelt tries to comprehend the gruesome sight body gets
closer thin figure devoid of curves

ROOSEVELT
My God it’s a girl

Platform comes flush with the scaffolding One cop clutches her
hair which comes off in his hands It’s a wig

Another rolls the body onto its side Its face is revealed
wi ut ¢ - Bloody holes where the sockets should be
And a goresoaked mass of flesh stuffed in the victim’s mouth

ON Roosevelt struggling to control his nausea and horror

FLYNN
Nope Commissioner it’s not a girl Though
not a boy neither Not really

Down the gash opened up in the front of the dress the entire
groin area is nothing but a bloody cavity

FLYNN
Believe me that mouth’s been stuffed with a
lot of Johns Dicks and Willies in its time
Though I wager it’s the first time he ever
tasted his own
(off Roosevelt’s confusion)
A boy-whore You never seen one before

Moore pushes through line of cops Still after Roosevelt

MOORE
They’re a pretty common fixture of the
downtown scene at night Boy prostitutes --
dressed in drag beat Just another way to
earn a living

ROOSEVELT
I’ve heard stories of brothels in the slums -
122394

MOORE
More like big pleasure palaces making it
easy for the rich to come and go in safety
They get a little dirty head back home then
it’s off to church in the morning

The cops start to lose interest Talking walking away

ROOSEVELT
(to Flynn)
Lieutenant why are your men leaving

FLYNN
Relax Commissioner Perverts killing each
other just makes our job easier Let’s go

ON Moore increasingly surprised by the following display

ROOSEVELT

All of you turn around now I want this
area searched evidence gathered From this
day forward if any of you turn your back on
a case due to the victim’s race social
class or profession -- I will personally rip
the badge from your uniform I want a full
report on my desk and the criminals who
Operate these brothels in my office by 9 am
tomorrow

(to Flynn)
And Lieutenant I tell you when to go not
the other way around Is that clear

INT ROOSEVELT’S OFFICE DAY

BIFF ELLISON 40’s brawny hot-tempered -- confronts Roosevelt
While PAUL KELLY 25 Black Irish self-educated perfectly
groomed looks calmly out the window

BIFF ELLISON
TI run a legitimate business I pay my taxes -

ROOSEVELT
one of your employees was found murdered
last night I have every right to hold you
responsible for any illegitimate activities
that take place within your establishment

BIFF ELLISON
(looks to Kelly)
What the hell’s going on I’ve seen to it
that we don’t have problems with the cops

Kelly remains silent

Kelly and Ellison exit leaving Strong alone with Roosevelt

MAYOR STRONG
What the devil is wrong with you Your first
day in office and you’re marshalling city
resources to defend sexual perverts

ROOSEVELT
(shocked)
The victim was a child sir A young boy
murdered mutilated his eyes cut out --

MAYOR STRONG
He was a prostitute The majority of voters
would be happy to see them all wiped off the
streets whether by us or each other

ROOSEVELT

MAYOR STRONG
How dare you question my authority You‘re
an employee If you wish to remain one
you’ll remember -- I set policy for this
city this department -- and you

case files again

SARA
Everyone eise walks in and out of that room
with impunity The last time I walked by I
heard a card game going on inside

FLYNN
It’s restricted to officers Miss Howard
Not secretaries If you don’t know the
difference it’s more proof you got no
business working here

She pulls herself free of the Roundsman Sees Biff and Kelly

PAUL KELLY
Miss Howard is it I suspect the
Commissioner’s secretary may be entertaining
a delusion that this city might actually
consider the notion of a -- policewoman

SARA
Mr Kelly So long as you walk the streets
in freeaom I continue to believe anything is
possible

Mayor Strong exits Roosevelt’s office turns to Biff and Kelly

MAYOR STRONG

LAZLO KREIZLER 40 urbane eccentric Austrian immigrant his
left arm withered Arguing before a DA and a weary JUDGE

KREIZLER
He maintains that the guard was attempting to
sexually assault hin

They’re talking about STEVIE TAGGERT 12 standing before the
bench eyes hard with cold cynicism

DA
That was never proven The official in
question is a family man with two children -

KREIZLER
who no doubt in the coming years shall be
requiring my services as well
122394

JUDGE
Dr Kreizler as an alienist you are
qualified to determine the boy’s sanity but
not to recommend his sentence

KREIZLER
My point is simply this appearances more
frequently conceal than reveal

(pause )

Consider this boy Born to an unwed mother
who did not even know the father’s name At
the age of three his mother dies of a heroin
overdose He sits grieving over her
decomposing corpse for three full days --
before being discovered by the landlord and
thrown into the streets

interest piqued by Kreizler’s knowledge

KREIZLER
How does a child survive such conditions He
must become harder than life as he knows it
I dare speculate that even you Your Honor
given a past such as Stevie’s would be a
very different person than you are today -
assuming you survived at all The fact that
this boy has in fact survived demonstrates
his intelligence and resourcefulness beat
You see sir what we call identity is a
fluid thing born of those events which
comprise our personal histories We have a
chance now to affect his identity by placing
him in a more humane environment for his own
benefit and that of society

DA
This is sentimental hogwash Your Honor
rejected by the scientific community and
society at large

JUDGE
Impressive talk Doctor But I certainly
don‘t see taking this hoodlum into my home -

KREIZLER
I have an opening for an errand boy at the
Institute for Child Behavior With his
survival skills he would prove an invaluable
resource

DA
To put such a menace back onto the streets --

KREIZLER
No Not the streets My home With myself

without shame

from the father of the deceased

It’s not our policy to inquire any further

So where has this body disappeared to

SARA (CONT’D)
(sotto voce)
The priests will prevent you from
interfering They despise the police and our
treatment of the poor -- not without reason

KREIZLER
At any rate circumstance -- or perhaps
design -- has denied us the opportunity to

examine this corpse as well
Points to the altar a beautiful porcelain urn

KREIZLER
The body of this boy has been cremated

PAUL KELLY (0S)
This is a surprise

Sara Roosevelt and Kreizler turn to see Paul Kelly the crime
figure crossing towards then

PAUL KELLY
Commissioner Roosevelt here with the great
Dector Kreizler Fascinating Doctor I
assume you’ve been filling him in on the
Zweig murder

ROOSEVELT
How do you know about that Have there been
other boys as well

PAUL KELLY

You don’t want to travel down this road
Commissioner You see it’s not only me
this entire city operates above the law
Your masters like their pets housebroken
they’1ll be angry if you misbehave

(pause)
When the poor are murdered their survivors
can only look to God for justice

He slips out of the chapel

KREIZLER
Mr Kelly is correct God does seem oddly
concerned with murdered boy prostitutes

circumstances

Fine sentiments Commissioner But you have
neither the means the method nor the

I’m well aware of that Doctor It’s why
I’ve come to you

Thank you

She turns away from him shy Then quickly exits the room

ROOSEVELT

What I’m about to tell you must be kept in
strictest confidence I propose the
formation of a secret task force to
investigate these murders You will have
complete authority

No one in the world possesses a more advanced
understanding of the psychopathic mind Your

necessary to apprehend this killer thus
proving that modern methods can be applied to

am not And so I must decline

ROOSEVELT
Doctor don’t hold the past against me

KREIZLER
I’m using the past as a guide to the present
That is more or less the nature of my work
sir I have learned that under pressure you
compromise much too readily

ROOSEVELT
Your decision only makes it more likely that
other children like Joseph Zweig and Mislav
Stipovich will fall victim to this man

Roosevelt and Kreizler look at one another for several moments

KREIZLER
I have one condition you must safeguard this
undertaking against all opposition which may
follow I ama fringe figure in this city
Threats have been made on my life An
association with me could damage you
politically Are you willing to accept these
risks I need your word As a gentleman

Roosevelt nods slowly Then shakes Kreizler’s hand

KREIZLER

I will need to assemble a team two or three
good detectives Modern forensic scientists
with no ties to the old corrupt system

I’ll visit the Cadet Academy in the morning
Well also need a way to stay in contact
without imperiling the secrecy of your team

Of course I will also need Mr Montrose -- he
is my bodyguard and so is intimately familiar

Taggert - I believe his knowledge of street
children will prove to be of assistance

share with such beings the common link of

SARA

Her light barely catching a moving FIGURE darting behind a
tombstone Or was it her imagination Looks back at the group
They haven’t noticed Should she say something Instead --

Opens her purse Pulls out a revolver Moves to investigate
THE GRAVEPIT - KREIZLER

KREIZLER
He visited me at odd hours whenever he
could sneak away Then one day he was
struck by a realization He had become
Marlena to find the streets of gold his
parents had promised But deep inside he
missed being Joseph I promised to help him
become that boy again

SARA - NAVIGATING A CORRIDOR OF HEADSTONES

She sees - fresh footprints in the snow Follows them
quickly disappearing beneath the heavy precipitation

THE GRAVEPIT - LUCIUS AND MARCUS

LUCIUS ISAACSON
Extensive damage to the laryngeal structure
especially the hyoid bone --

MARCUS ISAACSON
This boy was strangled before the mutilations
took place

SARA

The footprints have disappeared Looks back -- she’s forty yards
from the grave Tombstones shadows crosses - in the snowy
wind by her flickering light everything seems alive

THE GRAVEPIT - KREIZLER

KREIZLER
Then his father found out about our meetings
and forbade Joseph from seeing me He had
heard that I set children against their
families taught them to disrespect their
elders The stupidity of it all That he
could ignore his son’s profession and choose
instead to take his frustrations out on me

ON Marcus and Lucius

MARCUS ISAACSON
By measuring the attack angle of the blows
and factoring in Bertillon’s system with our
own calculations --

LUCIUS ISAACSON
-- the killer’s height is six foot two

SARA

Turns back towards the gravesite When suddenly she DROPS DOWN
out of frame Her lantern goes OUT

THE GRAVEPIT KREIZLER

KREIZLER
I tried to locate Joseph but I did not see
him again until his funeral
(almost to himself)
In the end I was simply one more person -
who failed hin

On the ground feeling foolish Realizes she’s tripped over a
headstone which has toppled over Snowy wind WHIPS UP

herself up

Startled the men scramble from the pit dash towards the sound

Holding her Derringer revolver on John Moore the reporter

MOORE
What the hell’s wrong with you Since when
did the city start arming hysterical women

SARA
(shakily holding her gun)
Stay where you are I’m with the police

MOORE
That’s why I’m here Miss Howard Put that
down and let me talk to the men in charge

Sara confused steadies her gun Kreizler and Isaacsons arrive
with Roosevelt Sara returns the gun to her purse

MOORE
Commissioner I have a hunch you’re about to
grant me an interview

ROOSEVELT
Listen to me Mr Moore -- this is a matter
much more important than my career or yours

MOORE
(writing on pad)
Can I quote you on that

Roosevelt SNATCHES Moore’s pad Tosses it to the ground
ROOSEVELT
We are conducting an investigation into a
series of murders Our work must be kept in
absolute secrecy

MOORE
Is this your idea of secrecy

He POINTS in the distance two lanterns Coming towards them
122394

CYRUS
The caretakers must have heard the shot

BACK TO THE GRAVESITE

Isaacsons jump into the pit Kreizler Cyrus and Sara quickly
gather equipment ON Moore looking down at the corpse He
studies it for a moment then takes Roosevelt aside

MOORE
His eyes are cut out - like the boy on the
bridge Whatever you’re on to here I want
in You can either put me on your team or
read about this in the paper tomorrow

ROOSEVELT
I’ll have you clapped in irons if you do
anything to jeopardize this investigation --

MOORE
You’re not in any position to argue

The lanterns draw closer

MARCUS ISAACSON

Before Marcus can respond Lucius calmly picks up his knife
SEVERS the corpse’s finger Wraps it in a cloth Carefully
places it into the satchel The others react stunned Moore

Fetch me a port will you

off Morgan turns towards Sara his back to the

JP MORGAN
I suppose your fiancee’s told you I’m
churlish cruel and barely human

SARA
(smiling)
No that’s what I read in the newspapers

Morgan chuckles Likes a woman with spirit

JP MORGAN
Winslow’s pleasant enough I suppose Though
frankly I wouldn’t think he‘’d have enough
fire for a woman such as you

SARA
(fencing)
You act as if you know me Mr Morgan When
it’s increasingly clear you do not

JP MORGAN
The facts I can guess Gramercy Park St
Katherine‘’s Radcliffe

SARA
Smith Other than that I fit quite neatly
into your preconceptions

JP MORGAN
On the contrary I was merely wondering
how a background so routine could have
produced a creature so startling

SARA
(after a pause)
I’m also remarkable in that I do not mistake
vulgarity for flattery Good evening sir

Moves away He watches her go smiling She locates Winslow
cornered near the bar by a drunk MATRON

MATRON
you can barely find a clerk who speaks
English anymore This new batch they’re
simply taking advantage of our generosity

right into his front tooth Of course now
he cuts his lip open every time he smiles

3ara laughs He makes her feel less intimidated by it all

SARA
I love you Brandon But I simply can’t bear
your friends

WINSLOW
Neither can I I’ve learned I much prefer
the company of middle-class career women --
particularly a certain police secretary on
secret assignment Don’t worry -- no one’s
within earshot

Cab pulls up Winslow heips her in and goes to close the door

Pay attention and you’ll understand why I do
what I do It is not an easy thing to
spread light through the darkness

Its coming from her bedroom at the end of the hall Growing
louder more insistent

Her lantern remains on the hall hook shining into the bedroom
122394 43

In the center sits a birdcage And the source of that noise

A parakeet inside is flying madly about the cage banging into
the bars Again and again Frantically

She approaches the cage Realizes why it’s so insane -
EYES B cuT OUT

She stares at the creature horrified when suddenly --

THE ROOM GOES DARK

The light in the hall has GONE OUT Gropes her way back to where
the lantern had hung Feels in the dark It’s gone

Moving slowly down the hall Towards the living room Breathing
heavy Terrified Hears footsteps creaking of boards Can‘t
tell from where Suddenly --

BANGS into something tall Nearly screams No -- just the
coatrack by the front door

Finds box of matches by the front door Struggles to light one

The light REVEALS Behind her a fleeting glimpse of a LARGE MAN
before he GRABS her

TIGHT SHOT revealing only the lower part of the killer’s face
nestled next to Sara’s terrified expression

WEALTHY MAN
You‘ve gotten what you want Now let me get
mine
LICKS her ear Then BLOWS out her match
She LUNGES for her coat GRABS her gun Turns and SHOOTS

“he FLASH of the pistol reveals him moving towards the window
An instant strobe-like effect She shoots again Again Again

CLICK She’s out of bullets Grabs the lantern lights it
Looks around frantic The window’s open

He‘s gone

Attack of the pen is undoubtedly masculine
There’re clear signs he was trained in the
Palmer system of penmanship Since Palmer
was only introduced in 1880 our killer can’t
be any older than thirty now

Kreizler enters with Roosevelt

KREIZLER
This man is an exhibitionist He craves
attention and takes ours as validation of
his actions We must be careful

ROOSEVELT
I agree Doctor

Miss Howard I’m ordering you off this
investigation -- for your own safety

SARA
My safety You never wanted me here in the
first place

Roosevelt stymied by her quick retort Kreizler observing

SARA

It’s one thing acting against me due to ny
gender It’s quite another opposing the
best interests of your own investigation
For whatever reason the killer’s chosen to
make a connection -- with me Rather than
iscourage him we should welcome this
opportunity to learn more about his
character

(to Kreizler)
Without understanding we will never be able
to stop him

Roosevelt looks around the room all eyes on hin

put us in a terrible spot Unless I

Thats cheap sentiment Doctor there is evil
in the world whether that jibes with your

So he’s killing them to keep them down
SARA
But at the same time maybe he identifies

with them He’s trying to rise up out of his
place too Leave behind his past And
these killings are his only chance

He’s got to be familiar with killing to
carry 1t off in public places Trained like
a hunter or a soldier

MARCUS ISAACSON

The mutilations resemble a hunter’s practice
of dressing his catch But to what end

ROOSEVELT
Excuse me -- these mutilations -- when I
served in the cavalry we were issued two
identical dog tags If a soldier died in
battle one was taken for identification the
other left in the victim’s mouth Could
our killer be practicing some variation

KREIZLER
If he was a soldier possessed by such
feelings it is likely he acted on them at
some point in the past

Excited team members throw out ideas in rapid succession

FIRES a shot RICOCHETS at his feet He turns towards Sara
Backlit by the lights of Thompson St she can’t see his face

Roosevelt and Lucius dash towards the killer

Meanwhile Moore gets a running start LEAPS the chasm between

The rope flies over the eyes of Marcus and Kreizler -

Moore LEAPS for the killer’s feet just as he grabs Chan with one
arm --

his feet expertly hitting the side of the opposite building

Previously he killed the boys then cut up

Pomeroy said he cut out his victim’s tongues
to silence their talk about him Our man

does not function it does not offend him
Why Because a bad eye cannot stare at him
I am now certain that our man too must
suffer from some sort of facial deformity --
most likely in his eyes themselves

We should all review our previous sources in
light of this facial deformity Particularly

Points to Kreizler A special hatred in his eyes

And what terrible threat to America do I
represent today

You seek to weaken the moral fabric of
American society This is clearly documented
in all your writings

(pause
You say that to change a man you must change
his environment You tell your team they
must consider this killer a victim Doctor
your doctrine puts man at the center of
morality weakening the public’s fear of God

But what do your theories tell the poor
That the crimes they commit aren’t the result
of their own drunkenness and sexual
misconduct -- but because the rich refuse to

rewarded that those with more have more
because they are more worthy in God’s eyes

KREIZLER
I’m sorry Miss Howard and the rest of you
but I refuse to accept this resignation

Miss Howard made a foolish mistake But now
we can use her mistake to our advantage
Sara you must make certain your fiancee
believes that nothing has changed

ON Sara the role she’s being forced to play sinking in

ROOSEVELT
I see your point Doctor The pressure will
ease off so long as they continue to believe
we have disbanded

Kreizler moves to his desk

KREIZLER
Morgan’s thugs have already cost us a full
day of work We have just six left until Ash
Wednesday I still feel these military
records are critical Miss Howard and I will

Moore flips through a small stack Kreizler’s set aside

KREIZLER (CONT’D)
Those aren’t important Cases with one
interesting feature or another -- but all

serious consideration

better We pulled a few files but there was

Here Adam Beecham Given a dishonorable
discharge for mutilating the bodies of
immigrant protesters at the 1891 Haymarket
Riots in Chicago co

Now Kreizler’s interested Looks through his own file on Beecham

KREIZLER
But he’s not the child of immigrants His
father was born in Mew York City It’s
possible we’re incorrect about that aspect of
his profile but --

kills cn religious holidays I think the
profile isn’t too far off

I’ve been on a sabbatical myself Too bad
it’s been involuntary

(pause)
Every day I told myself that sooner or
later I’d make it back to the top

investigation would be my ticket Instead
it’s finally killed any chance that I1l ever
get my old life back So here I am
Starting a new one Maybe it really began

a lot of time trying to live down that act
ef conscience Now it’s all I have left

Crammed our heads full of them -- that’s his

Why does he kill He’s trying to get out
He wants to prove something to Morgan What
We know how the Doctor thinks How he gets
his answers All we have to do is find them
within ourselves

Well Morgan’s a beacon of traditional values
“- except in his private life of course He
sure wouldn’t approve of boy prostitutes

LUCIUS ISAACSON
Hes also worried about immigrants -- needs
them for cheap labor but he’s afraid they1ll
corrupt the country with foreign values

SARA
OK -- so our man’s killing only the most
corrupt foreigners - setting an example to
the rest that they’d better behave Trying
to impress Morgan doesn’t it make sense

Yeah as a wild speculation

This entire investigation has turned on
Speculation Besides we have his name now
Finding him is just legwork How can we give
up when we‘re so close

inexperience makes the more impressive case
Yet I certainly can’t make that decision for

any of you

because we want to The Doctor’s the only

one with the experience to really

this killer
Silence then --

understand

I grew up in the slums At 14 I ran away
from home I thought I deserved a better
life than my parents could give me I always

thought I could go back for then

But while

I was gone my father died and then my
mother killed herself I sacrificed them

because I wanted more

He’s just trying to save himself

Europe is privy to your private pain

JP MORGAN
Indeed I’m too old and much too disliked to
pretend I’m someone else But let me tell
you this Miss Howard I have never acted
from any impulse more base than true love

SARA
I suppose that depends on your definition of
love You feel something powerful for a
woman and so you act upon it Truly

JP MORGAN
Love is a state of grace Miss Howard In
which for a time all sins and burdens are
suspended Loneliness conquered And for
this love demands a price -- that gratitude
remain even after those first powerful
feelings have faded away And that is the
measure of a true lover

SARA
And you are such a lover

You must’ve read in the papers -- I was until
recently employed by the police department

for the deaths of several boy prostitutes

from all around the docks give chase A frenzy

MEANWHILE AT THE NORTH END OF THE DOCKS

The same cab stops before a TUGBOAT with a pilot Area now free
of cops Moore Sara Kreizler emerge hurry into the boat
Cyrus and the Isaacsons were merely decoys

KREIZLER
Cast off Let’s go

EXT APPROACHING ELLIS ISLAND - NIGHT - ON THE TUGBOAT

Be prepared to leave as soon as he arrives

EXT LOW BUILDINGS - MOMENTS LATER - OUR TRIO

In the shadows waiting for a Guard to pass They hurry down the
row of low buildings Cheaply-constructed shacks

KREIZLER
One of these should be an Episcopal Chapel

Each door marked with signs of different faiths Find Episcopal

The faith of the father who turned his back
on his son’s abuse and conspired in his
humiliation
Sara draws her gun Moore opens the door slowly Dark
INT EPISCOPAL CHAPEL (ELLIS ISLAND) - MOORE SARA KREIZLER

Seems to be a fair-sized room chairs for pews high ceilings
Feel their way down the aisle From someplace muffled WHIMPERS

Then CREAKING of wood They whirl around trying to locate it

SARA
Over there
MOORE
No -- I think it’s coming from above

CLICK An electric floodlight comes on Shining from a second-
floor balcony Blinding They’re all trying to see him

ANGLE From behind them a Figure SWINGS down on a rope from the
rafters Moore whirls around at the last moment --

MOORE
Sara

Too late DURY’s boots SLAM into Sara’s back knocking her down
Her gun goes flying Moore scrambles to retrieve it
122394 128

Dury in his caped suit lands on his feet grabs the dazed Sara
places the blade of his knife up between her legs Standoff

On the altar - a BOY gagged blindfolded bound
His blade pressing through the fabric Sara WINCES in pain

SARA
Goddamn you Moore just shoot him

A beat Moore tosses his gun to the ground

EXT NY YACHT CLUB (E 42ND and RIVER) - NIGHT

Pleasure vessels of the leisured class in dock DISCOVER

OS they hear the TOOT of a tugboat i

They scramble out race down the pier as the tugboat DOCKS
Roosevelt and Kelly hop on board

ROOSEVELT
The others are on the Island

The Captain doesn’t answer He TOOTS his whistle again

From adjoining craft emerge - Flynn and Donner with six more
THUGS Kelly goes for his gun Before he can get to it -

DURY
You’ve been so curious A noble sacrifice -
to die for knowledge

Hides the gun under the altar Approaches the boy Raises his
knife then CUTS away his gag and blindfold VINCENZO the
boy-whore Stevie died trying to warn at Paresis Hall Dury
caresses Vincenzo’s eyes with his knife tip Almost lovingly

DURY
You trusted me so much Trust faith -- I
needed your help to get us both here
122394 129

VINCENZO
(Italian accent)
I will do anything whatever you ask

DURY
So desperate for my approval It’s touching

VINCENZO
But you promise to teach me please

Dury PRESSES the knife tip under Vincenzo’s eyelid Hard

DURY
Do you know who I am My father is the
richest man in America

Dury yanks the boy to his feet Cats the bonds on his wrists
Vincenzo hobbling adopts a feminine persona Convincing

VINCENZO
I’ve never met a man so powerful like you

DURY
People live for the hope ’1l1 smile on then
and change their lives forever

Dury fights temptation as Vincenzo touches him

DURY
Like my father -- my mother so desperate to
convince him she was warm kind loving
when actually

Vincenzo’s hands on Dury’s groin

DURY
She deserved to die like all the rest

KICKS Vincenzo away Boy can’t run -- his ankles are tied

Sara suddenly bows her head begins praying in Italian Hail
Mary etc Why

DURY
My father’s blood runs through my veins
Corruption runs in yours Let it flow
rivers back to the sea

GRABS Vincenzo in a chokehold Knife MOVES down his belly

KREIZLER
Japheth Dury They gave everything to your
brother Adam Beecham While they reserved
for you Japheth Dury only humiliation
pain and rejection
122394 130

Dury’s never heard anyone talk like this Sara keeps praying

DURY
I’m the real Adam Beecham -- that other
bastard -- he was stupid and slow - he

didn’t deserve to be called Morgan’s son

ON Vincenzo’s eyes -- as they lock with Sara’s An understanding
we don’t yet comprehend

KREIZLER
Yet he was While you were forced to play
the role of dirty foreigner the bastard
You even went along to please then

ON Dury -- mesmerized

KREIZLER (CONTD )
But you must accept the fact that no matter
what you do Japeth Dury you will never earn
the love that was taken from you and given to
Adam Beecham

Dury’s demeanor DARKENS
Meanwhile Vincenzo nods S ‘ eaking to him in Italian

SARA
(in Sicilian English subtitles)
There’s a gun under the altar hit him
with a candlestick Now

DURY
(moves knife down the boy’s chest)
I am becoming Adam Beecham More with each
day How could I have succeeded for so long
if I were not the son of --

Vincenzo GRABS a metal candlestick SLAMS it into Dury’s head

Dury releases the boy Vincenzo searches wildly for the gun
beneath the altar Sara screaming instructions in Sicilian

Dury LEAPS knife in hand Vincenzo finds the gun FIRES

The bullet grazes Dury in the shoulder He SPINS and falls to
the ground Dury gets up DASHES towards the windows Vincenzo
fires again misses Dury CRASHES through the glass and runs out
onto the island grounds towards the slip

As Dury raises his knife again Kreizler arrives in the doorway

KREIZLER

Startled Dury flees towards the corner turret staircase A
wounded Moore waves on Kreizler who gives CHASE

ON THE GROUND - FLYNN AND MEN

Look up See through the windows of the turret Dury headed up
the staircase with Kreizler behind hin

Flynn aims his GUN at Kreizler
KREIZLER ASCENDING THE TURRET
Ducks as a window pane EXPLODES He continues
WOMEN’S DORMS SARA

Looks out the window Sees Flynn shooting upwards

She exits the dorms dashes back to the landing overlooking the
ground floor Processing Center

ASCENDS the staircase which continues up to the apex of the
roof where a walkway runs along the center gable

DURY

Reaches the top of the turret KNOCKS out a glass pane facing
the roof Runs out onto the A-frame roof Before him lies

An expanse of rooftop -- four hundred feet ahead to the next
turret On his right the roof slopes steeply up towards the
center gable On his left a four story drop In the ocean
beyond he spots the Police Boat approaching Ellis Island

Kreizler appears at the turret window calling out to Dury

KREIZLER
They will not allow you to live Dury You
are better off with me rather than then

DURY
I’d rather die

KREIZLER
Would you Dury I know a thing or two about
wanting to die

Kreizler steps onto the roof Dury TURNS heads up the sloping
wood tiles towards the gable at the summit Kreizler follows
122394 133

Kreizler’s no good at this Wooden shingles SLIP out from
beneath his feet Down the sloping rooftop and off the edge

FLYNN - ON THE GROUND BESIDE THE MAIN BUILDING

Moves backwards tries te get a clear shot at them But the lip
of the island around the Main Building is too narrow - he can’t
get back far enough even to see them let alone get a clear shot

FLYNN
(to Men)
Get up there Surround then
MOORE LEAVING THE MENS DORMS

The gash on his chest bleeding Makes it to the second-floor
landing and looks down onto the ground floor Processing Center

HIS POV Flynn‘’s Men rush into the building Donner splits off
from the others and runs off in another direction

ROOSEVELT KELLY AND THE SHORT THUG

On the tugboat they’re far enough away to have a good view of
the rooftop The Short Thug has a clear shot Dury and Kreizler
are sitting ducks

ROOSEVELT
You have a perfect shot

Short Thug can’t help himself He aims his gun at the roof --

Kreizler below and Flynn’s Men closing in Dury holds his knife
out towards Kreizler who continues towards him undaunted

We know what it’s like to believe that
through labor through effort we can leave
behind our pain and transform ourselves into
another person wT

Kreizler SLIPS recovers Dury’s eye begins to TWITCH

KREIZLER
You were denied your birthright -- love and
safety -- because of an accident of birth

You were punished for the very fact of your
existence How could you help but risk
everything in hopes of becoming Adam Beecham

Dury looks at Kreizler then Sara Flynn’s Men getting closer

KREIZLER
But sooner or later we must face this fact -
- we have only one life one history It is
who we are We will never escape it And on
that day we must decide -- to die or live
with ourselves

Dury’s eye in full CONTORTION Skin stretching so it looks as if
the pupil’s about to pop out of his skull The knife trembling
Kreizler reaches for it Will Dury give it over

KREIZLER
Japheth -- let us help you live

ANGLE -- Another figure climbs over the ROOF of the gable It’s

ROOSEVELT
Pierpont Morgan

JP MORGAN
You are a stubborn man sir
(a smile)
But despite that because I’m in a good mood
I offer you an opportunity to redeem
yourself Standard procedure requires that
you hand this killer over to the police

ROOSEVELT
As Commissioner he will remain with me

Then you are operating outside the law
Commissioner Thirty officers standing
beside me are prepared to enforce -

ON Dury who hears at long last the voice of his --

Morgan looks at Dury -- pathetic eye now twitching grotesquely

DURY (CONT’D)
Has the time come I’ve worked so hard
to prove I’m worthy I know you can save me
I’m not afraid Call me your son and all my
troubles will vanish I’m ready Father -

light in all the darkness -

ON Dury as he expires his eyes still open Kreizler moved

ON Sara holding back tears This is not what she thought

(off Morgan’s reaction)
Don’t look so surprised sir I am the
Police Commissioner of the City of New York
I’ took an oath to clean up this force Which
I will now begin to do with your complete
support

JP MORGAN
You’ve obviously taken leave of your senses
Think for a moment whom you’re addressing

ROOSEVELT
(implacable)
I am addressing a murderer sir You knew
for years that boys were being slaughtered
yet you kept silent

JP MORGAN
I have had to protect my name For the good
of this nation Now my reputation is secure

ROOSEVELT

If it is your reputation that concerns you
sir then you will allow me to do my job
without obstruction

(a slow smile)
I am offering you a chance to redeem
yourself Mr Morgan We have the letters
Dury sent to you They will remain hidden
0 long as my colleagues and I remain
alive and unharmed

JP MORGAN
You have letters so what You have no proof
that I received them

MARCUS ISAACSON
Not entirely true sir On one of the
envelope seals we found your fingerprint

LUCIUS ISAACSON
It may not mean much today but it could be
very important to future generations Do you
believe in the future of fingerprinting

You have your place in history to consider
Pierpont
ON Morgan considering After a pause --

JP MORGAN
My dinner is getting cold

He turns away heads back towards the dock

I confess that my faith in my theories has
been tested by the losses we have
each of us suffered But you have all
restored me And so I will return

Kreizler raises his glass smiling PAN around the faces of our
team Battered worn proud
KREIZLER (CONTD)
I have asked too much of you Forced you to
surpass your limits Demanded that you look
into yourselves and face what you saw But
you have all exceeded the promise we made to
each other when we began And because of
that -- you have given me hope for the
future

They raise their glasses Sara TOASTS

see myself running numbers downtown

PAUL KELLY
(a disarming smile)
If you give me half a chance I’m sure I
could come up with a sweeter offer

SARA
Kelly I think we should make one thing clear
between us I can stand your company now
7 But that certainly doesn’t mean --

Kelly kisses her softly After a moment she pulls away
122394 140

PAUL KELLY
Doesn’t mean what

SARA

two worlds that’s why we feel something
But this could never ever work
