TITLE SEQUENCE OVER MUSIC

A series of tight CLOSE-UP shots of dancers moving in high
energy fast paced sexy choreography Very provocative Legs
Arms Butts Boas Sequins Costumes High heels A
kaleidoscope of images and colors

END TITLES ON A BLACK SCREEN
FADE IN sounds of PEOPLE TALKING -- GLASSES CLINKING -- all
the BACKGROUND SOUNDS of a BUSY HIP NIGHTCLUB SUDDENLY

loud DRUM ROLL
CAMERA is low moving through BACKSTAGE passing CURTAINS

and
the WINGS flying out onto a shiny black STAGE awash in
light PUSH IN on FOOTLIGHTS which are now blinding us
blasting into camera as they form the word

BURLESQUE
DRUM ROLL ends with a CYMBAL CRASH The SCREEN goes BLACK
Then we hear an opening MUSIC INTRO a bawdy QUARTET
EXTREME CLOSE UP RED LUSCIOUS LIPS speaking directly

into
CAMERA in a smoky sultry voice

TESS
Once upon a time a long looong
time ago there was a good little
girland they called her
REVEAL TESS A stunner with impossibly long lashes
theatrical make-up and a sequined skin-tight band-aid of a
dress She works the tight stage of the club toying with
the AUDIENCE

TESS (CONTD)
Burlesque
MUSIC BLARES from a HOT YOUNG BUMPER BAND -- sax drums
bass
-- wearing bowler hats suspenders and lots of ink The
crowd HOOTS Lame streamers EXPLODE from the stage

TESS (CONTD)
Some say she up and died-of
neglect Abandonment

(WHISPER)
-old age
The clubs red booths are about half-full with a hip crowd
Walls cluttered with photos Celebrities tucked in shadows

TESS (CONTD)
But I sayno matter how hard you
try you cant keep a good girl
down And Ive got a bevy of em

INT BACKSTAGE DRESSING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

A DOZEN gorgeous leggy GIRLS fight for the mirror Miles of
skin Heavy make-up Lashes Boobs Butts Fishnets

Boas And SEQUINS Oceans of them Its definitely

decadent Completely cabaret

TESS (0S)

Come to think of it none of them

are all that good which isnt all

that bad

SEAN a cute gay guy with an armful of accessories
pushes his way through the girls and in a blur tightens a
corset tosses a boa adjusts a garter just so

TESS (0S) (CONTD)

Eight shows a week Sixteen
gorgeous girls Thirty-two towers
of luscious legs

BACK ON TESS --
Behind her our GIRLS slink onto the stage one by one

TESS (CONTD)
Say hello to Scarlett Jesse
Anna Coco-puff And Georgie-Girl
The girls gather at the edge of the stage lit by

footlights

etc

of

moving in place to the beat of the INTRO MUSIC Hips sway
Fingers snap Tess weaves playfully between them

TESS (CONTD)
All of them the creme-de la creme

(CYMBAL CRASH)
De la creme
The girls strike nasty (but funny) provocative poses

TESS (CONTD)
Each one a bastion of bodacious
(Coco bends over peers
between her legs)
Elegance
TWO GIRLS upside down on chairs NAIL aerial splits

TESS (CONTD)
Not to mention their other
(smacks Coco on the ass)
Ass-ets
Coco raises a brow moves her butt to a LOUD BUMP-AND-GRIND

TESS (CONTD)
Welcome to the Burlesque Lounge
dead smack in the center of the
Sunset Strip-- did I say strip
(cat calls from audience)
I meant TEASE
FOOTLIGHTS FLARE UPLIGHTING THE GIRLS They shift their
weight hitting the beats with risque moves and hip-thrusts
as they MOVE DOWNSTAGE suggestively toward the audience to
the MUSIC

EXT MAIN STREET GRUNDY IOWA - NIGHT
A small grime-streaked steel town hanging on by the skin

its teeth Boarded-up storefronts a run-down AandP CAMERA
than

MOVES past an old sign WELCOME TO GRUNDY and lands on
a broken neon sign that reads DWIG S BAR It flickers so
you can read the name DWIGHTS Then goes back to DWIG

INT DWIGHTS BAR - SAME

Chipped paint Old beer posters A few pathetic customers
Beer on tap Pinball standing lonely in the corner

A REGULAR drains his beer tosses down a quarter and starts
to leave Someone stops short at the table

ALI
Uh excuse me You forgot
something
He turns Sees
ALI ROSE One hand holding a bar rag the other planted on
her hip Ali has a look thats all her own short shorts
white platform sandals hair piled up high more make-up

but has a confidence thats got nothing to do with age

REGULAR
No thats your tip

ALI
Huh See now thats interesting --
you and I must do math completely
differently cause me I start with
the six beers I brought you add
the four spills I cleaned up the
five times I refilled your peanuts
plus the three times you
accidentally touched my ass then
I tack on lying to your wife when
she called looking for you twice
and I come up with a sum thats a
hell of a lot more than twenty-five
cents
Before the Regular can respond Ali is joined by LORETTA --
30s wearing every one of those years hard
LORETTA

I guess but wouldnt it be so much

better if they actually sang

The Girls trade looks knowing Alis overstepping here Ali
doesnt feel the vibe-shift surges ahead

Tess slowly spins around in her chair to face Ali Peers at
her with a supercilious gaze

TESS
When burlesque started Which
waswhen

ALI
(searching her memory)
Oh Well this book said it came
after

TESS
Vaudeville -- is the word youre

looking for Derived from the 15th-
century French expression voix de
ville -- voice of the city

Popular songs of the time that were
strung together into stage shows

Which over time gave birth to

another kind of show in which

talented girls showing a bit more

skin danced did skits and yes
sang In addition to being

raunchier these shows were

funnier hence the new name
Burlesque comical in French

Ali sees the Girls enjoying this dressing-down immensely
Tess stands peers down her nose at Ali

TESS (CONTD)
Dance major Juilliard I did my
thesis on Burlesque

ALI
Oh Ok Its just-- Its just
that I CAN sing and--

TESS

We can all sing But they dont

come to hear us sing They come to

see the best dancers in town backed

by the greatest singers in history

(then condescending)

But tell you what when you find

someone with better pipes than

Sarah Vaughn Billie Holiday and

Etta James-- you let me know

She sashays out leaving Ali standing there with whats left
of her dignity and an empty cocktail tray The Girls launch
back into prepping for the show

attitude I get from you is cause
I want to do it here

The MUSIC starts in again And this time Ali comes alive
She may not have perfect technique or the best extension

she exudes an ambition and sexuality no one has seen from

before Its like she becomes a woman before our eyes She
misses a step or two but who the hell cares

On the floor Sean gapes eyes popping Tess is poker-faced
Coco and Georgias expressions turn from dubious to
respectful Nikkis eyes narrow

At the bar Jack freezes a huge rack of glasses in his arms

- unable to tear his eyes away

As the SONG CLIMAXES Ali finishes with an alluring toss of
her ass then lands in a sexy layout on a chair owning the
stage The music ends A stunned silence The only sound

is Alis heavy breathing

Then Georgia jumps up APPLAUDING EFFUSIVELY

NIKKI
What are so you happy about thats
your replacement

GEORGIA
Yeah but shes really good
Tess and Ali are in a stare down

TESS
I want so badly to say something

Tess narrows her eyes at Ali Then looks over at Nikki Coco
and Georgia Georgia gives an effusive THUMBS UP-- then
suddenly becomes overcome by nausea covers her mouth and
RUNS to the bathroom to puke--
Tess rolls her eyes looks back at Ali

TESS
