OVER BLACKNESS we HEAR a BACH HARPSICHORD CONCERTO And then a

WOMAN -- breathing hard -- straining harder and harder -- until
finally we HEAR a NEWBORN BABY CRYING -- and we
FADE IN

EXT VULCAN FAMILY HOME - DUSK

The image is spectacular aglow in DUSK LIGHT a beautiful BABY
just born held in a WOMANS HANDS It is being cleaned warm
water runs down its face and body

TIGHT ON the MIDWIFE (female 60s) who holds and cleans the
baby as it CRIES Another younger Midwife can be seen behind
her assisting with the pitchers of water As she cleans the
baby she says to someone OFF-CAMERA

MIDWIFE
He is strong

The baby now calm gets SWADDLED He is then gently held out
to the new MOTHER

AMANDA GRAYSON late 20s An original beauty She lies ona
divan spent but eager to hold her first child She tenderly
takes the infant into her arms tears in her eyes mesmerized
She holds the wrapped baby tight and whispers sweetly

AMANDA
hello

CLOSE ON the YOUNGER MIDWIFE standing at the rear of the room
She raises an eyebrow as she quietly speaks

YOUNGER MIDWIFE
The baby is healthy Why does she cry

MIDWIFE
(a beat then)
She is human

A distant quiet BUZZ -- and the elder Midwife stands looking
into the distance And this is when we see for the first time
that the Midwife has POINTED EARS

MIDWIFE (CONTD)
Sarek arrives

The Midwife moves away -- we PUSH IN on Amanda who looks up for
a moment clearly disquieted

A planet of massive tortured ROCK FORMS distant cities
constructed atop and underneath them A HOVER-SPEEDER in the
mid-ground kicks up dust backlit by the sun as it traces the
horizon We PAN WITH IT revealing a FAMILY HOME built
seamlessly into a rocky mountainside

SAREK (late 40s a Vulcan) comes out to the balcony through the
rear doors of the home He moves to Amanda and kneels He
looks at the child -- his child -- and says

SAREK
Well done

She looks at him for a beat then says flatly -- with just
enough rancor

AMANDA
Thanks
He regards her Knows hes in TROUBLE --
SAREK

Your tone suggests disappointment The
Science Council required my presence for
a session regarding--

AMANDA
Dont do that You knew I wanted you
here

The Vulcan Midwives share a look Sarek glances at them Nods
The two women excuse themselves Sarek reaches over touches a
small touchpad -- the HARPSICHORD MUSIC STOPS He says
clinically

SAREK
As you are aware the Vulcan male is
traditionally not present at the moment
of delivery

AMANDA
Well traditionally Im not the one
giving birth

AMANDA (CONTD)

I moved here -- to another planet -- to
be with you I needed you to be with me
today Holding my hand and telling me
Im doing great even when Im just
breathing the best I can

Sad that she has to tell him this at all she just looks back at
the baby -- finding comfort in his innocence Sarek considers
this He moves closer to her Whispers intimately

SAREK
You are correct I should have been
here I am sorry

And with her free hand she pulls Sarek closer -- and kisses
him And the two look at the baby

the

SAREK (CONTD)
I had a thought That we might name the
child after one of our respected early
society-builders His name was Spock

She looks at the baby not immediately taken by the name

SAREK (CONTD)
Your silence does not suggest enormous

enthusiasm
AMANDA
No Spock
(smiles touches his
face)
Spock

She looks at Sarek Spock it is

SAREK
The child has your eyes

She pulls back the babys swaddling revealing his ears She
gently rubs the top of his right ear -- AND IT UNFURLS
revealing a small soft pointed VULCAN EAR

AMANDA
and your ears

And off the image of this TINY BABY half-human half-Vulcan
we FADE OUT And over BLACKNESS we BEGIN TO HEAR an ALARM
SOUNDING -- GROWING -- and the SUPER THREE YEARS LATER APPEARS
-- and finally the BLACKNESS IS SPLIT BY TURBO-LIFT DOORS
OPENING and we REVEAL THAT WERE ON

Robau is led into the enormous dark bridge A dozen Romulans
at controls Robau does his level best to portray confidence as
he is led up a walkway to AYEL Behind him sitting silhouetted
and motionless turned away and looking off is his captain A
presence always felt in this scene This is NERO

Ayel touches a panel then THROWS AN IMAGE into the air before
Robau A ROTATING HOLOGRAM OF A UNIQUE-LOOKING SPACECRAFT (we
will refer to it as the JELLYFISH)

AYEL
Are you familiar with this craft

Robau regards it Then

CAPTAIN ROBAU
Who is your commander
(silence then re Nero)
Is it him

AYEL
You will speak only to me

CAPTAIN ROBAU
Then ask your commander what right he has
to attack a Federation vessel

AYEL
That was hardly an attack My commander
will easily destroy your ship If you do
not respond to the question

Robau considers the hologram again And what his answer

mean for the fate of his crew
CAPTAIN ROBAU
Ive never seen it Or any ship like it

AYEL
Are you familiar with -- or better know
the location of -- Ambassador Spock
Ayel has thrown another HOLOGRAM -- A FLOATING ROTATING IMAGE

OF SPOCK who appears to be 75 earth-years old The baby born
just three years earlier Robau is as confused as we are

central assumption of Quantum -- everything that can happen
Cosmology does happen in equal and
parallel universes --

century earth composers of the
following musical progression -- Paul McCartney and John
Lennon

And we find ANOTHER VULCAN CHILD -- then ANOTHER -- all in these

where PROFESSORS walk hands behind their backs surveying this
mass mental martial arts test
Were on ANOTHER VULCAN CHILD as she gets an answer wrong -- AND

question Gets it right PUSH IN ON HIM as the COMPUTER SAYS

Your score is one-hundred percent
Congratulations Spock

off his face we CUT TO MOMENTS LATER as Spock collects his
things As he does three young VULCAN BULLIES walk up behind
him Spock glances at them then back to his things

YOUNG SPOCK
I presume youve prepared new insults for
today

VULCAN BULLY 1
Your mother lies with many men

Spock just NODS Tries to ignore the fact that IT STINGS

YOUNG SPOCK
I have no such information

VULCAN BULLY 2
You are neither human nor Vulcan -- and
therefore have no place in the universe

YOUNG SPOCK
(swallowing that too)
This is your thirty-fifth attempt to
elicit an emotional response from me
Logic dictates you would cease by now

fq

VULCAN BULLY 1
Look He has human eyes They look sad
dont they

VULCAN BULLY 2
Perhaps an emotional response requires
physical stimuli

And Bully 2 PUSHES Spock -- who stumbles back almost falling
into one of the bowls He looks up as

VULCAN BULLY 2 (CONTD)
Hes a traitor you know Your father
For marrying her

Spock stares -- we see him fighting the urge but hes unable --
AND HE CHARGES THE BULLY AND TACKLES HIM INTO THE BOWL They
land inside -- Spock cries flailing as he punches Bully 2

The other two stand atop the bowl stunned -- shocked -- unsure
what the hell to do -- and we CUT TO

ARGUE at a distance down the hall

-- where Im from when
someone hits you you hit back-

- how is that not logical -- Spock had no reasonable
-- They pick on him -- they expectation of being
tease him -- every day physically injured --

-- Which is precisely when
reason must guide his actions

-- I want him to embrace above all

Vulcan you know that but

he has to be himself-- which

means occasionally being -- His humanity is very the
human source of his ostracism

-- When Vulcans get disgusted

with each other they never

just walk away do they -- No
-- Well humans do

And Amanda walks away leaving Sarek standing there He turns --
sees his son down the corridor Approaches And were PUSHING

IN on Spock studying the fear in his eyes His father stops in
front of him looming there looking down stoically

YOUNG SPOCK
I did not mean to create conflict between
you and mother

After a beat Sarek seems to soften a little No anger in his
face Takes a seat beside his son

SAREK
In marriage conflict is

YOUNG SPOCK
constant

SAREK
Natural
(a beat)
Emotions run deep within our race In
many ways more deeply than in humans
Long ago they nearly destroyed us
that is why we followed the teachings of

Surak Now you must choose

YOUNG SPOCK
between you and mother

SAREK
Never my son But you may choose the
ethic of logic Logic offers a serenity
humans seldom experience The control of
feelings so that they do not control
you

YOUNG SPOCK
They called you a traitor
(then)
You suggest that I should be completely
Vulcan and yet you married a human
why

Sarek is clearly conflicted by this But he holds steady

SAREK
As Ambassador to Earth my duty is to
observe and understand human behavior
Marrying your mother was logical
(Spock seems disquieted)
Spock You are fully capable of choosing
your own destiny The question you are

faced with is which path you will
take This is something only you can
decide

A glare to George and Frank walks off Jim nervously follows
his brother pulling out a small FLOATING DISC --

he drives -- having never done this before hes as nervous as
he is determined --

EXT IOWA ROAD - DAY - LATER

updated modified RADIO -- scans stations momentarily losing
control of the car -- but hes back on track as he finds a HARD
ROCK SONG -- and HES STARTING TO FUCKING LOVE IT -- PILOTING
SOMETHING THIS FAST FEELS GOOD

He reaches for a CONVERTIBLE ROOF latch -- then the other -- but
with the speed hes driving THE ROOF RIPS RIGHT OFF THE FUCKING
CAR -- Jim glances back wide-eyed -- and the roof TUMBLES
through the air landing on the road -- and we PUSH AND ARC
AROUND as a POLICE OFFICER runs out from taking a roadside PISS

SPEEDING AFTER HIM SIREN BLARING

Back at the Corvette Jim YANKS the steering wheel TOWARD THE
COP -- who RISES to avoid the Corvette which SCREECHES onto a
perpendicular DIRT ROAD kicking up wild dust as the Cop ARCS
QUICKLY to follow --

car SKIDS -- PIVOTS -- and he LEAPS FROM THE CAR WHICH SAILS

SIDEWAYS OFF THE CLIFF EDGE -- FALLING falling the COP
comes to QUICK a STOP in CLOUDS of DUST as the Corvette EXPLODES
ON THE QUARRY FLOOR --

The angry Cop hops off his hovercruiser hand on weapon as Jim
Kirk out of breath exhilarated gets to his knees

COP

PUSH IN TIGHT as the Alien finally WHISPERS terrified

And the Guards look at each other seemingly with concern

Opens it

flips through it almost casually we see SKETCHES of

the JELLYFISH SHIP PAGES OF COMPLICATED MATH EQUATIONS

We found this book in your cell
Cartography mathematics-- what do these
mean This date here -- eleven years
from now-- what happens then

FLUORESCENT MAPS)
And why attempt to smuggle in maps of
Federation space

Neros face betrays nothing no fear no doubt Cold as fucking
ice The Interrogator happens to stare at a page in the book
A DRAWING OF SPOCK He closes the book

KLINGON INTERROGATOR (CONTD)
When you were captured we assumed you
were a spy sent from Romulus to surveil
the Empire But because the Romulans
deny your existence I believe you are
much more than that

Interrogator looks over to the Guards nods A Guard approaches
with some kind of GLASS CONTAINER we HEAR something wet FLIP-
FLOPPING around inside but we cant SEE what it is

KLINGON INTERROGATOR (CONTD)
Your ship remains in orbit above us now
Weve been asking for its secrets for too
long That is why am here We want to
know how it works and I believe now
finally you will tell us

A Guard uses TONGS to pull out the most DISGUSTING creature
youve seen from the container a SLUG with SUCKERS and spikes
covered in a grimy muck -- it FLIP FLOPS

theres nothing they hate more than

his eyes open -- furiously determined not to be broken -- as
they FORCE HIM TO SWALLOW IT -- he DOESNT SCREAM as the
wretched thing makes its way down his esophagus and into his
stomach --

KLINGON INTERROGATOR (CONTD)
They try to claw and bite their way out
of any dark space theyre in

Nero stares at the ceiling in HORRIFYING INTERNAL PAIN -- but
straining to block it out PUSH DOWN on Neros wide crazed

Reluctantly Spock walks into frame She begins adjusting his
collar This is our ADULT SPOCK Gripped by anxiety but trying
like hell to look impassive

AMANDA (CONTD)
There is no need to be so anxious
Youll do fine

SPOCK
I am hardly anxious mother
(beat then anxiously)
And fine has variable definitions
Fine is unacceptable

She just smiles as she works his collar He sees this and
annoys him He tries to move her hands away to stop with

doesnt let go of her hands A meaningful silence between

Should I choose to complete the Vulcan

INT VULCAN SCIENCE ACADEMY - COUNCIL CHAMBER - DAY

An imposing yet BEAUTIFUL INDOOR ATRIUM Spock stands before

the VULCAN HIGH COUNCIL Among faces on the dais his FATHER

seated beside the SCIENCE MINISTER and other VULCAN LEADERS

SCIENCE MINISTER
You have surpassed the expectations of
your instructors Your final record is
flawless With one exception I see you
have applied to Starfleet as well

SPOCK
It was logical to cultivate multiple
options

it
his
he
SCIENCE MINISTER
Logical but unnecessary You are hereby
accepted to the Vulcan Science Academy
A distinction all the more significant
given that you will be its first half-
human pupil It is truly remarkable
Spock That you have achieved so much
despite your disadvantage Welcome to
the Academy

They all start to rise But Spock is suddenly unsettled

SPOCK
If you would clarify Minister-- what
disadvantage are you referring to

SCIENCE MINISTER
your human mother

58

As the council disperses we PUSH IN on Spocks face -- the same
look he had when he took punches as a kid He glances at his
father to say something but Sareks the consummate diplomat
His eyes command remain calm Spock STRUGGLES then makes
the first spontaneous -- human -- decision of his life --
SPOCK
Council -- ministers I must decline
Everyone STOPS A solid BEAT Confused looks turn cold
SCIENCE MINISTER
No Vulcan has ever declined admission to
this academy
SPOCK
Then as I am half-human your record
remains untarnished
SAREK SPOCK
Spock You have made a
commitment to honor the Vulcan At the moment Father I can
way-- think of no greater way to
honor our race than to
attend

Starfleet as its first
Vulcan

SCIENCE MINISTER
Why did you come before this council
today Was it to satisfy your emotional
need to rebel

SPOCK

I came with the intention of enrolling
as my father wished However your
insight has convinced me otherwise
Therefore the only emotion I wish to
convey is gratitude Thank you
Ministers for your consideration

(a contained fuck you)
Live long and prosper

He looks to his father whose disappointment is evident --
still God bless him Spock walks out --

That makes her smile So he moves closer to her
KIRK (CONTD)
Okay so youre a cadet Studying

Whats your focus

UHURA
Xenolinguistics Lemme guess you dont
know what that means

KIRK
Let me guess study of Alien languages
phonology morphology syntax-- it means
youve got a talented tongue

UHURA
And for a moment I thought you were just
a dumb hick who only has sex with farm

animals
KIRK
Well Not only
UHURA

You think youre smart

KIRK
Oh baby Im the smartest

Something sad in that A BURLY STARFLEET CADET appears

BURLY CADET

Beyond belief but nothing I cant
handle

You could handle me Thats an
invitation

The Burly Cadet spins Kirk around

Hey You mind your manners

The cadet swings his fist but Kirk HEADBUTTS HIS HAND BREAKING

IT -- another Cadet PUNCHES KIRK then THROWS HIM into a table

which Kirk FLIES OVER landing hard -- another Cadet GRABS HIM

pulls him up -- Kirk SLAMS FIVE FAST PUNCHES that send the Cadet
back -- when ANOTHER CADET PUNCHES HIM -- yet another HOLDS KIRK
-- and that last punch is repeated THREE-- then FOUR times --

UHURA
Enough STOP

Another punch and Kirk FLIES TO THE FLOOR - hes out of it but
wont give up The Cadets UNLEASH on him and really PUMMEL HIM -
- and Kirks spirited but LOSING -- about to LOSE BAD -- when
an EAR-SPLITTING WHISTLE makes everything STOP -- they turn --

standing in the doorway is a tall rugged Starfleet officer --
CAPTAIN CHRISTOPHER PIKE

I couldnt believe when the bartender
told me who you are

KIRK
and who am I Captain Pike

PIKE
Your fathers son
(then smiles)
For my dissertation I was assigned the
USS Kelvin Something I admired about
your dad he didnt believe in no-win
scenarios

KIRK
He sure learned his lesson

PIKE

Depends on how you define winning
Youre here arent you

(off Kirks look)
That instinct to leap without looking--
that was his nature too And in my
opinion its something Starfleet has
lost Were admirable respectable But
overly-disciplined

(beat)
Those cadets you took on theyll make
competent officers -- but you can bet

your ass theyll run home to momma the
minute theyre looking down the barrel of
a Klingon phaser cannon

KIRK
-- why are you talking to me

PIKE
I looked up your file while you were
drooling on the floor Your aptitude
tests were off the charts-- what is it
dyou like being the only Genius Level
repeat-offender in the midwest

KIRK
Maybe I love it

PIKE
So your daddy dies you can settle for
a less-than-ordinary life

(beat)
Or do you feel like youre meant for
something better Something special

And that just hangs there for a beat Because Pike just hit a
nerve Kirk does his best not to show it -- still absent-
mindedly fiddling with STARFLEET SHIP SALT AND PEPPER SHAKERS

KIRK
Come to think of it I do want to feel
special You know what Im gonna go
start a book club--

PIKE
Enlist in Starfleet

KIRK
Enlist You must be way down on your
recruiting quota for the month--

PIKE
If youre half the man your father was
Jim Starfleet could use you You could
be an officer in four years have your
own ship in eight

Hes getting under Kirks skin -- but Kirk keeps up the
grabs his jacket stands --

Eyes lock

And you never will

He smiles as he takes a seat at the back of the shuttle Straps
in as it RISES

Are you people deaf I told you I dont
need a doctor damnit I AM A DOCTOR

Kirk turns to see a MAN being forced OUT of the BATHROOM by a
FEMALE FLIGHT OFFICER -- at 34 he has a Southern lilt and looks
like a prisoner waiting for the guillotine to fall

Darlin with no windows --
-- Sir for your own safety -- I suffer from Aviaphobia
siddown or I will MAKE you case you dont understand big

They GLARE at each other then the man drops into the seat
beside Kirk The ship TORQUES to one side and the man GRIPS his
armrests pale sweating -- glances at Kirk

I think these thingsre pretty safe--

TIGHT ON a stern STARFLEET ACADEMY PRESIDENT

ACADEMY PRESIDENT
James T Kirk Step forward

Its a huge Starfleet chamber Golden Gate Bridge visible
through huge windows 500 cadets a nervous KIRK among them

He stands moves to one of two PODIUMS

ACADEMY PRESIDENT (CONTD)
An incident has occurred today that
concerns the entire student body
Academic immorality by one is an assault
on us all It will Not Stand Cadet
Kirk evidence has been submitted to this
council suggesting you violated the
ethical code of conduct pursuant to
regulation 1743 of the Starfleet code
Is there anything you care to say before
we begin

KIRK
(uncomfortable beat)
Yessir I believe I have the right to
face my accuser directly

President nods toward the assembly SPOCK RISES He and Kirk
MEET EYES for the first time Its clock-stopping

ACADEMY PRESIDENT
Step forward please This is Commander
Spock one of our most distinguished
graduates Hes programmed the Kobayashi
Maru test for the last four years

Spock steps up to the OTHER PODIUM President nods

SPOCK
Cadet Kirk It is obvious you somehow
managed to install and activate a sub-
routine in the programming code thereby
changing the conditions of the test

We happen to find GAILA in the crowd fucking pissed

KIRK
Your point being

ACADEMY PRESIDENT
In academic vernacular you cheated

KIRK
Respectfully Define cheating

SPOCK
To deceive by trickery

KIRK
Now let me ask you something I think we
all know the answer to the test is
rigged isnt it You programmed it to
be unwinnable

ACADEMY PRESIDENT
Mr Kirk I dont see how the intent of
the exam is relevant to these
proceedings

KIRK
Because if Im right Sir then the test
itself is a cheat

SPOCK
Your argument precludes the possibility
of a no-win scenario --

KIRK
I dont believe in no-win scenarios --

83 FIND PIKE amongst the officers in attendance His eyes locked
on Kirk This is his boy His recruit And hes INVESTED

SPOCK
Then not only have you violated the
rules youve failed to understand the
principle lesson

KIRK
Please enlighten me

SPOCK
You of all people should know Cadet
Kirk -- A captain cannot cheat death
ON KIRK The first punch by Spock that landed The cockiness

slips away as he senses where this is going --

KIRK
IT of all people

SPOCK
Your father Lieutenant George Kirk had
assumed command of his vessel before
illed in action did he not

Shit The DADDY card Kirk a mix of ANGER and EMBARRASSMENT

KIRK
How long did it take you to look that up

SPOCK
How long did it take you to program the
virus that allowed you to cheat

The President smirks considers ending this now but doesnt
its just too damn entertaining

KIRK
Maybe you just dont like that I beat
your test

SPOCK
I am Vulcan Like is not a verb in our
vernacular Ive simply made the logical
deduction that youre a liar

KIRK
What an idiot I am for taking that
personally --

SPOCK

Agreed Furthermore you have failed to
divine the purpose of the test

48A
83 KIRK
Enlighten me again

SPOCK
The purpose is to experience fear Fear
in the face of certain death To accept
that fear and maintain command of ones
self and ones crew This is a quality
expected in every Starfleet captain

Kirk absorbs that Then --
KIRK

So youre telling me the point Of the
whole thing Is to be afraid

SPOCK
Fear is necessary yes

KIRK
Have you taken the test Commander Spork

SPOCK
Spock As a Vulcan I require no
additional training to control my
narcissism when making command decisions

No he DINT irks hit guys for a lot less -- The crowd all
but OOOOOOHsS But Kirk aint fucking done yet

KIRK

You keep reminding me that youre Vulcan
And Im sure youre really proud of that
who wouldnt be-- but isnt it true you
people dont experience fear at all

ON SPOCK He raises that eyebrow And Kirk sees no matter
how subtly that he has fucking made CONTACT Smelling blood -

KIRK (CONTD)
And if thats the case -- Whats that say
about your ability to make command
decisions

Well Looks like Kirk just hit him in HIS fucking weak spot
And before this lovefest can continue --

A REDSHIRT bursts into the HALL -- Kirk turns to look -- they
all do -- now were SPEEDING IN behind the REDSHIRT who runs to
the President hands him a DATAPAD President reads it
Everyone watches on edge -- finally quietly

Cadet Kirk -- you are on academic
probation pending the result of your
hearing Cadets report to Shuttle

irrelevant PIKE passes by him all fucking business but

buy it

Christopher
(beat hardcore)
Answer my question

PIKE
No You answer for the genocide you just
committed on a peaceful planet--

NERO
prevented genocide
(beat calms)
Where I come from Christopher this
ship is just a mining vessel I chose a
life of honest labor to provide for

myself and the wife who was carrying
my child
(beat)
sit here now knowing you as enemies

Not just of today But of tomorrow I
watched as your Federation did nothing
They let us burn to death as our
planet broke in half

Curiosity behind Pikes eyes

PIKE
Then Nero youre confused Romulus has
not been destroyed How can you blame
the Federation for something that hasnt
happened--

NERO

It did happen I remember it I felt
it

(then pained)
When I lost her I promised myself I
would not speak another word until the
day of my retribution In twenty five
years I forgot the sound of my own

voice but I didnt forget the pain
That feeling cannot be erased
(MORE )

154 NERO (CONTD)
(turning to anger now)
A feeling that every surviving Vulcan now

shares
Pike just looks at him Sees how fucking far GONE he is
PIKE
If what you say is true you can save

Romulus You have a second chance to --

NERO

-- yes which is a gift I wont waste on
mercy
(beat)
My purpose Christopher is not simply to
avoid the destruction of the home I
love
(beat)

but to create a Romulus which exists
free of the Federation Only then will
she be saved

And the she could refer to the planet or to Neros lost
love Either way Pike knows a losing battle when hes fighting
one Ever so nobly he quietly says --

PIKE
Then we have nothing more to discuss

Nero reaches for something under the counter Pike lies upon
Retrieves A FAMILIAR GLASS CONTAINER -- inside -- DOZENS OF
CENTAURIAN SLUGS the very ones used on Nero
NERO
Its not the fault of the human race that
Starfleet chose Earth as its center
Youre a more noble race than my fallen
cousins Ill take no pleasure in your
extinction

PIKE
How reassuring

Nero opens the container reaches for a pair of TONGS

NERO

feeling the full effect of fate playing its hand but realizing
he doesnt recognize him

SPOCK PRIME
I have been and always shall be

SCOTTY
You eat nothing A bean and youre done
for a week I need food And now youre
here -- so Thank you Where is it

SPOCK PRIME
You are in fact the Mr Scott who
postulated the theory of trans-warp
beaming

SCOTTY
Yes Thats exactly what Im talking
about How dya think I ended up here
I got into a debate with my instructor on
the issue of Relativistic Physics as they
pertain to subspace travel He seemed
to think that the range of transporting
say a roast turkey was limited to a few
hundred miles -- so I told my instructor
I could not only beam a bird from one
planet to an adjacent planet in the same
system -- which is no big deal anyway --
but if I were so inclined I could
actually do it with a lifeform So I
tested it on Admiral Archers prize
beagle Which was a mistake

KIRK
I know that dog What happened to it

SCOTTY
Ill tell ya when it reappears Dunno
Feel guilty

SPOCK PRIME
What if I told you your trans-warp theory
was correct That it is indeed possible
to beam onto a ship that is travelling at
warp speed And that you only required
the correct field equation to
recrystallize dilithium

SCOTTY
I havent been stationed here that long
If such an equation had been discovered
Ida heard

SPOCK PRIME
The reason you havent heard of it Mr
Scott is because you havent
discovered it yet

Kirk reacts Scotty reacts -- is almost spooked -- sobers up a
bit really regards Spock Prime Skeptical Amused

think of space as the part thats moving

already has it Well you mustve done
something right to be assigned to that

Preferably not There is however
Starfleet Regulation 619

Yes I forget what little regard you had
for such things 619 states that any
commanding officer who is emotionally
compromised by the mission at hand
must resign said command

So I need to emotionally compromise you

SPOCK PRIME

you I am emotionally compromised

And Spock is now fucking CHOKING Kirk -- HE SLAMS KIRK AGAINST
THE WALL -- SPOCKS CHOKING THE LIFE OUT OF HIM --

SAREK
Spock

And everything -- everything -- STOPS Spock red-faced
releases his grip Kirk GULPS air and tumbles to the ground
Spock staggers back Kirks hardly able to speak close to
collapsing But despite his brutalized face his expression
isnt about spite or hatred but compassion

Spock sees the faces of the STUNNED CREW staring at him But
worst of all Sarek His father Spock levels his chin
Quickly wipes his eyes Trying to regain some semblance of
dignity looks to McCoy Softly --

SPOCK
Doctor I am no longer fit for duty I
hereby relinquish my command on the
grounds that I have been emotionally
compromised Please note the time and
date in the ships log

JESUS Spock just QUIT And after a beat he leaves the
room Sarek follows a moment later

The crew just stands there in stunned SILENCE Finally --

SCOTTY
I like this ship Its exciting

McCoy turns to Kirk exasperated --

MCCOY
Congratulations Jim Now weve got no
Captain and no first officer to goddamn
replace him

ON KIRK The moment is upon him

KIRK

handle it -- howd you get back

CHEKOV
You vant us to trust you but you vont
tell us the truth

KIRK
No No I wont-- hey Im the Captain
now I dont have to tell you anything
Now listen we need to figure out a way
to catch up and get to Neros ship

SULU
Theres not a chance Theyre gonna be
in geosynchronous orbit around Earth in
ten minutes Well never make it

MCCOY
Even if we could you cant go in guns
blazing not with their technology
thats suicide

KIRK
Then we find a way to get on that ship
and steal the black hole device away from
them

You must not punish yourself

Speak your mind Spock
SPOCK
That would be unwise
SAREK
What is necessary is always wise
Watch Spocks face Struggling with whats pent-up inside
SPOCK
I feel as conflicted as I once was As a
child Have I made so little progress
SAREK
(beat softly)
You will always be a child of two worlds
I am grateful for that And for you
(painfully)
And not only because you are all I have
left of her
Spock looks at Sarek This is as close to emotion as hell
get
SPOCK

I feel anger For the one who took her
life An anger I cannot stop

SAREK
I believe she would say do not try to

You asked me once Why I married your

the youngest of the bunch gets up the courage to chime in
incidently becoming the very first officer to say

CHEKOV
Keptin Kirk Excuse me plees could
I

All eyes shift to the wonder-kid who awaits permission to speak

189

KIRK
Yes Chekov-- you dont need to ask
permission to--

CHEKOV
Based on the Naradas course from Vulcan
Ive projected that Nero will travel past
Saturn If we could drop out of warp
behind one of Saturns moons say Titan
the magnetic distortion from the planets
rings will make us invisible to Neros
sensors We could follow him to Earth by
staying in his blind spot

KIRK
What blind spot

CHEKOV
Its exhaust wake If we adjust our
shield frequencies they shouldnt detect
us

MCCOY
Wait a minute-- anyone understand this
kid How old are you

CHEKOV
I am seventeen Sir how old are you

MCCOY
Were all old enough to shave here

SPOCK (0S)
Doctor Mr Chekov is correct

Everyone turns surprised SPOCK has entered the bay --
galvanized full of purpose --
SPOCK (CONTD)
I have reviewed his telemetry If Mr
Sulu can maneuver us into position I can
beam aboard Neros ship

KIRK
I wont order you to do that Mr Spock

SPOCK
Romulans and Vulcans share a common
ancestry Our cultural similarities will
make it easier for me to access their
ships computer to locate the device

KIRK

tenses only now sensing this unforeseen danger AYEL HOLDS THE
WEAPON Strong Tough But under it all terrified

AYEL
The men and I have discussed this What
we are about to do

We have to turn the ship around We can
save our home

Nero turns slowly and deliberately -- Ayel tenses

AYEL (CONTD)
Stop

Nero now faces Ayel blades at his throat -- Ayel growing more
nervous as he faces his master The surrounding crew stare on
frozen in the moment only slightly confirming their makeshift
mutiny with scared looks

AYEL (CONTD)
We can go back Thats what we want We
have taken our vengeance on Vulcan No
more We want to go home now
Nero considers this nods gently

There is no need Ayel To threaten me

Ayel is massively relieved Nero gently reaches out holds
staff (still aimed at him) He deactivates it -- the blades

instantly RETRACT

And just as Ayel realizes hes fucked Nero somehow activates
the staff in a way we have not seen -- AND THE BLADES APPEAR ON

SPOCK PRIME
I am not our father

An incredible beat our two Spocks in eye lock both minds
processing conversational possibilities at an incredible rate
surreal extensions of each other separate but connected

SPOCK
Fascinating

SPOCK PRIME
There are so few Vulcans left We cannot
afford to ignore each other

Young Spocks eyes flicker in puzzlement
SPOCK

Then why did you send Kirk aboard when
you alone couldve explained the truth

241

SPOCK PRIME
(beat simply)
Because you needed each other Opposing
yet complimentary opposites It was that
balance between us -- I should say
you and Kirk -- that often made the
impossible possible

SPOCK
it was a test

SPOCK PRIME

(no his heart heavy)
Im in no position to pass judgment
my actions have robbed you of much I
could not also deprive you the revelation
of all you can accomplish together of
a friendship that will define you both in
ways you cannot yet realize

There is to young Spocks surprise vulnerability in that

SPOCK
How did you persuade him to keep your
secret

SPOCK PRIME
I inferred universe-ending paradoxes
would ensue should he break his promise

SPOCK
You lied

SPOCK PRIME
I implied

SPOCK
A gamble

SPOCK PRIME
An act of faith One I hope youll
repeat in the future

Young Spock considers an enduring friendship between him and
Kirk for the first time understanding it But --

SPOCK
The futures not what it used to be in
the face of extinction its only logical
I resign my Starfleet commission and help
rebuild our race

already located a suitable planet on
which to establish a Vulcan colony and
assist in the foundation of a new science
academy

SPOCK
My future cannot be determined by your
past We are one but not the same

SPOCK PRIME
Then I ask that you do yourself a favor
Put away logic Do what feels right
The world youve inherited lives in the
shadow of incalculable devastation but
theres no reason you must face it alone

SALUTE

And Kirk pauses His eyes go over to the empty science console
with a sense of incompleteness In fact everyone on the bridge

feels it A bitter truth theyll have to accept

KIRK

SPOCK PRIME
Then I ask that you do yourself a
favor put away logic and do what
feels right The world youve inherited
lives in the shadow of incalculable
devastation but theres no reason you
must face it alone

And from around his neck he removes the PENDANT that until now
weve only caught glimpses of Places it on the table beside
his younger self The feeling in his eyes is profound

SPOCK PRIME (CONTD)

This was a gift to me Representing
a dream One we were unable to fulfill
(softly)

The way you can now

And moves to the door Stops Offers the VULCAN SALUTE
SPOCK PRIME (CONTD)
As my customary farewell would appear
oddly self serving I will simply say
good luck

Their eyes hold Spock turns disappearing into the corridor
Young Spock stares at the empty doorway a beat his mind a
jumble of thoughts Looks to the pendant and realizes its a
HOLO-EMITTER After considering a beat he hits an activation
button and a MOVING HOLOGRAPHIC MESSAGE materializes before him

CAPTAIN JAMES T KIRK WILLIAM SHATNER As always brash wry
confident -- and SINGING

KIRK SHATNER

Happy birthday to you happy birthday to
you

(stops grins)
I know I know its illogical to
celebrate something you had nothing to do
with but I havent had the chance to
congratulate you on your appointment to
the ambassadorship so I thought Id seize
the occasion Bravo Spock -- they tell
me your first mission may take you away
for awhile so Ill be the first to wish
you luck and to say

(beat emotional)
I miss you old friend

and were PUSHING IN on Young Spock taking in the image of
Kirks future self the message but above all -- the clear

unquestionable friendship these two men had

INT CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

As Spock Prime walks off down the corridor he passes right by a

man conferring with a nurse -- the man pauses turns its
SAREK Suddenly overcome by a feeling that the stranger whos
just passed him is oddly familiar

I suppose Id always imagined us
outgrowing Starfleet together Watching
life swing us into our Emeritus years

KIRKSHATNER (VO)
I look around at the new cadets now and
cant help thinking has it really been
so long Wasnt it only yesterday we

PIKE
I am relieved

He opens a BOX in his lap -- glorious in repose a MEDAL

PIKE (CONTD)
And as Fleet Admiral for your unique
solution to the Kobayashi Maru its my

Pike containing a smirk pins the medal to Kirks chest

Congratulations Captain

KIRK
Thank you Sir

was my first best destiny if thats
true then yours is to be by my side If
theres any true logic to the universe
