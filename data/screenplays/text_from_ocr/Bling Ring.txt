EXT HOLLYWOOD HILLS MANSION - NIGHT 1

A Toyota parks and five teenagers get out and walk towards
us down a quiet residential street in the Hollywood Hills

One of them a slightly drunk girl in a pale blue Juicy sweat
suit stumbles

DRUNK GIRL (NICKI)
(laughing)
Shit

GIRL 1 (REBECCA)
C’mon Hurry up

They come to a gated home A girl that seems to be the
leader leans down and pulls on an unraveling part of the
bottom of the chain link fence

She rolls under and the others follow

A loud song kicks in as they put their sweatshirt hoods up in
unison and turn around and walk backwards toward the house

Theyve done this before they have it down
One checks under the mat of the front door we follow them as
they go around to the back checking doors and find a back

window open

A guy gives Girl 1 a lift up we see her bright underwear as
she climbs inside into a laundry room

She runs around to open a side door for the rest and they
slip inside

Once inside we follow REBECCA into a bedroom dressing area
She is the 17 yr-old Korean-American ring-leader who is
totally cool and composed

She looks over her shoulder at the others with a raised eye-
brow

REBECCA
Let’s go shopping

And she pulls open the closet door
CLOSE UP grabbing Louis Vuitton bags

A drawer opens with a few Rolexes that are scooped in to a
Louis Vuitton duffle bag

An underwear drawer is opened and picked through

They get into the Toyota and peel out

THE BLING RING

CLOSE UP flashbulbs go off

Titles intercut with montage of Mug shots of attractive
teenagers and news clips

We see a clip of black and white video surveillance of the
kids’ approach to the house walking backwards with hoods up

Pan across a row of Louboutin platform heels
We see the glittery view of Hollywood at night

CLOSE UP a Facebook page of a party photo of Rebecca in the
hat we saw her try on earlier

Pan across a pile of quilted Chanel bags

TV image of a starlet on the red carpet posing for
pictures

CLOSE UP on a stack of shiny diamond necklaces

And how is Sam related

NICKI
Weve adopted her we met in ballet
class when we were little

LAURIE
I was friends with her mother--

NICKI
Mom this is my interview I met
her when my parents divorced Now
she lives with us my mom’s home
schooled us all for a while

LAURIE
The philosophy of ‘The Secret’
it’s based on the law of
attraction but my great-
grandmother and grandmother both
studied this philosophy It’s man’s
relationship to the Divine that’s
what energy science means

NICKI
Since I was young I learned about
every religion

KATE
So Sam was in your ballet class
did she have parents

NICKI
She had a dysfunctional background
we both did

LAURIE
And I met her mom--

Can I talk please The reason we
related so well is my dad is a

is

lesson for me to grow and expand as

SHANNON
Nicki has expressed to me a lot of
her humanitarianism

NICKI
It’s my main goal God didn’t give

INTERVIEWER
We’re here with Nicki Moore who
just served 30 days for her
involvement in the Bling Ring and
shared a cell block with one of the
victims- Lindsay Lohan There were
reports that Lindsay was crying

day which is hard when you’re
trying to be strong I just tried
to really keep to myself I just
tried to get through the day the
days are so long you’re woken up at
530

INTERVIEWER
And how’d she look

NICKI
She got to keep her extensions in
most girls were talking about oh- I
had to take my weave outshe was
in orange like all of us

INTERVIEWER
Were you nervous you were next to
her because you were accused of
being a part of that group that
allegedly robbed her house

NICKI
Yeah it was hard for me there were
tabloids and on TVs in there
people were watching the story and
they were showing the surveillance
video and stuff and little do
people know that when that video
came out I was actually in contact
with her manager to tell her who I
believed the people were who robbed
her house and eventually when
I’m able to tell my story people
will know the truth

INTERVIEWER
So that’s nerve wracking she could
think you robbed her house

NICKI
