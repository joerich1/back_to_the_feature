FADE IN
Abrupt CLOSE UP on MAX a plain wall behind him
1 INT LIMBO RADIO 1

He is 20 normal looking not too nebbish punkish
bookish

or stylish He is a high-strung guy enjoying a rare moment

of un-self-consciousness

MAX
Theres an old joke It comes from The
Iliad but I think it was popularized by
Oscar Wilde It goes like this
A bears taking a shit like out in the
woods one day And he sees this rabbit
also taking a shit The rabbit wait I
mean the bear hes shitting up a storm
cuz hes been eating Mexican The
wipings taking forever and his shit
keeps sticking to his fur Wait what
happens next Oh right-- he asks the
rabbit if he ever has trouble wiping The
rabbit says no shit just slides right
off him So the bear picks the rabbit up
and wipes his ass with him
(pause as if for applause)
Well I never said it was a good joke
And see that makes it perfect because
its pretty much the story of my life

view

BANANAS

We can now see that hes perched on a stool wearing a REM
shirt and old jeans He gesticulates vaguely as he talks

MAX (CONTD)
Growing up my parents were huge Woody
Allen fans Still are Personally I hate
him Same thing with the Beatles such a
part of my background that I must have
been about 16 by the time I realized how
useless it was to rebel by ignoring the
Beatles or any other cultural artifact of
their generation Even if I did spend my
childhood hearing my father go on and on
about how like Nirvana would never mean
anything because theyre not the Beatles
blah-blah I dont know this is all
starting to sound a little bit too
angsty you know and thats about the
last thing Im going for here Shit I
really got off track there didnt I

As Max shakes his head a hanging RADIO MIKE comes into

It has the call letters of a college radio station on it

High on the wall behind him a glowing ON AIR light is
revealed The perspective is skewed the studio appears
cavernous and completely barren

2 INT MAXS CHILDHOOD HOME FLASHBACK DAY 2
YOUNG MAX about five sits on the floor and watches

with his FATHER a large relaxed man with a mustache who
reclines in a tacky 80s chair and smokes a cigar

MAX (0S)

Anyway like the Beatles thing and this
is the point of that whole long-winded
example I was force-fed Woody Allen from
a young age I remember watching Bananas
when I was about five Of course I hated
it

Young Max is laughing hysterically at the screen

Max stands to the side watching his younger self and his
father The radio mike hangs in front of him
MAX (CONTD)
This is my old house We lived here ina
dull suburb of New York until I was ten
when we moved to a different house in a
different dull suburb of New York

On TV a woman is bit in the breast by a snake and is
chased
by a group of soldiers

YOUNG MAX
Daddy why are they running after her

FATHER

(KINDLY)
Someday youll understand Pay
attention youll learn something

Young Max turns back to the screen wide-eyed
3 INT MAXS SECOND HOME FLASHBACK 3

In pajamas ADOLESCENT MAX 16 watches a newer TV in an
identical family room This time ANNIE HALL is playing

MAX (VO)

Oh yeah This wasnt the first time I saw

Annie Hall but it was the first time I

actually appreciated it I was flipping

channels on a Saturday afternoon and

there it was and I was stunned to find I

loved it more stunned to find that my

parents may have had a point all along
MORE

MAX (VO) (contd)
Although they were definitely wrong
about Bananas

CLOSE ON Adolescent Max totally engrossed in the film

4 INT HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY FLASHBACK 4

Adolescent Max walks alone to class Other students rush by
in groups He looks a little lost

MAX (VO)

Oh God high school I hated this place
I was a Junior when I gave up trying to
fit in Fortunately being a social
outcast is a lot easier when your school
the

haircuts)

is filled with idiots
A pair of GOTH POSERS pass Max keeps his distance From

other direction a 6 FOOT TALL GIRL makes eyes at Max He
walks into a water fountain drops his books

5 INT HIGH SCHOOL GYM FLASHBACK 5

Adolescent Max gets hit in the face with a volleyball
Everyone laughs at him including the COACH

Max stands to the side and winces

MAX
There was something in Annie Hall I
identified with Maybe it was the style
of humor or the defeatist attitude I
dont know All I know is I kept going
back Different people are inspired by
different things and my source of
inspiration became a 20-year-old movie
about a failed relationship

The volleyball rolls over and he picks it up
6 INT RADIO STATION -- PRESENT 6

From behind Max we see the station as it really is small
dark cramped and totally filled with crap Max wears
headphones sits before a large console and audio gear

He now holds a volleyball

MAX
So after high school I ended up here
There was never really any choice not
going to college was not an option Of
course I brought Annie with me Good
thing too

MAX (CONTD)
Watching it quickly became about the only
thing I could count on to go right
7 INT JENS ROOM FLASHBACK NIGHT 7

Max is with five friends in the double and they all have
lingering style-baggage from high school (eg bad

MAX
(TO CAMERA)
It was freshmen year when we started
watching Annie Hall as a tradition
(LOOKING AROUND)
Jeez this must have been the very first
time Whats Amy doing here Im pretty
sure Amy wasnt here

AMY is attractive bookish and sitting on Maxs bed
CHARLES a skinny guy in a large chair tries to get her
attention by wiggling his eyebrows seductively

Max puts the tape in the VCR hits rewind

and moves to sit

on his bed He pauses when he sees how close hell come to
Amy Finally he climbs over her and awkwardly sits at the

far end

Amy watches rolls her eyes and looks at BETH who shakes
her head sadly Beth is pretty in an earthy way spunky and
sad at the same time She looks sympathetically at Max who

is trying not to act nervous (and failing)

The couple is SAM whos short and charismatic with a

slightly punkish personal style and JEN

same height cute

and serious conservative dress They lie on the floor

together

MAX (CONTD)

(TO CAMERA)
Thats Sam and Jen Sam was the alpha-
male of our group which tends to consist
mostly of zeta-males He had been going
out with Jen a couple weeks and we were
all waiting to see if she would change
him

Sam slides a pillow under her

SAM
Are you comfortable honey

JEN
Im fine Sam I was worried about you

Sure you dont want me to move over

SAM
Oh no no Jen if youre happy Im
happy

Max and Charles exchange a look-- there they go again Max
makes a show of putting a pillow under a large Darth Vader
doll Beth laughs Amy is amused Sam looks back and is
embarrassed Jen rolls her eyes and gives Sam a look

JEN
Are we gonna watch this movie or what

AMY
Oh that was so sad Relationships dont

(TO MAX)
I can see why you like this so much It
reminded me of you

MAX
Uh thanks I guess Does that mean you
liked it

Max and Amy stand and face each other as the lights fade to
black around everyone else

AMY
I didnt say I liked it I said it
reminded me of you It reminded me of
what I didnt like about you the
cynicism the neurotic insecurity and oh
yeah when you started calling me every
day All the reasons we were never more
than friends

MAX
Well at least youre being honest

AMY
Of course Im being honest This is a
fantasy extrapolated from a flashback

How could I lie to you

MAX

(TO CAMERA)
Im the only person I know who gets
insulted in his own fantasies

Charles walks by Amy takes his arm and they disappear

into
the surrounding darkness which DISSOLVES TO

Erica

away Max suddenly sees someone Beth looking at him He
blushes self-conscious and hurries away

MAX (VO)

MAX
Or incredibly sad Im amazed Im the
only one who can tell Take any couple

esteem Its always something

BETH
Living with you would be a nightmare Id
be afraid to bring any boyfriends home
Oh uh sorry

Awkward pause

MAX
Well just because I see it doesnt mean
I talk about it I dont say a word to my
suitemates

BETH
You guys never talk about anything

Oh come on we have philosophical
discussions all the time

from here

BETH
Yeah I loved it Im serious Im so
glad we did this

MAX
Yeah me too

BETH
But man relationships are a lot of work

Beth stops him and they sit on a bench The night is cold
They sit close and lean in speaking in hushed tones

BETH
If Im going to jump into anything with
you Max I need some sign that youre
serious about it About me

MAX
What You want me to get a tattoo or

days

Beth sits up pulls her jacket closed

BETH

MAX
No wait Im sorry Im sorry hold on

BETH
Max I dont think this is such a good
idea I mean it would be really foolish
to jeopardize our friendship

MAX
No it wouldnt

BETH
We shouldnt have rushed into this Im
sure you know it wouldnt have worked
out

MAX
I dont know that
BETH
Please tell me we havent hurt our
friendship You dont even know how much
you mean to me

MAX
Im starting to get the idea

Hes dazed slightly ill Beth touches his arm gently and
walks away Max turns to us A radio mike swings into view

MAX (CONTD)
Things werent the same after We quickly
became the kind of friends who say Hi on
the paths but dont stop walking Then

majors and basically except for the
random phone call I havent seen her in
ages

DISSOLVE TO
MAX thoughtful PULL BACK TO REVEAL
17 INT LIMBO RADIO 17
Max speaking in the empty station suddenly gets intense

MAX
All these dates had one thing in common
And it took Charles of all people to
point it out to me

18 EXT CAMPUS QUAD TODAY -- FLASHBACK 18

Its late January and the campus is showing signs of a
temperamental winter

MAX (VO)
This morning we were skipping class

Max and Charles walk across the quad towards us At first
they are only specks in the distance

CHARLES
Max youre insane

MAX
Its ridiculous that even at a liberal
school like this I have to put up with
anti-Semitism

CHARLES
So you got a C minus Dont you think
youre getting carried away

MAX
He couldnt just fail me think about it
The paper was about my grandparents
experience in the Holocaust

CHARLES
Your paranoia has always been out of
control but this is absurd

MAX
You dont understand youre not Jewish

CHARLES
Neither are you

MAX
But the professor probably thinks I am

CHARLES
And wasnt that the paper that you handed
in two weeks late

MAX
You know what else I think he might be
German

CHARLES

Professor Wang Will you stop it
We can now see that Charles has a fedora cocked back on his

head and is wearing incongruous Vegas clothes

They walk past and into the University Center
19 INT UNIVERSITY CENTER -- CONTINUOUS 19
Its a low-traffic time of day

CHARLES
So what do you want to do tonight
MAX
Im not sure It is the beginning of the
semester its time for our Annie Hall
night

CHARLES
Have you ever noticed that the more Annie
Hall you watch the less successful you
are romantically I think wed do much
better if we watched say Oceans 11

MAX
What are you talking about If youre
sick of Annie Hall thats one thing but
dont blame our sad little lives on it

20 INT GENERAL STORE -- CONTINUOUS 20
Charles picks out breath mints

CHARLES
No Im telling you I was thinking about
this over break Ever since we started
watching it what has your love life been
like And mine Every semester we watch
this movie and then spend the semester
alone

MAX
Alone Last semester you hooked up with
like a dozen women

CHARLES
You know actresses dont count
(POIGNANTLY)
Im looking for a meaningful
sophisticated relationship Like Frank
and Ava No more shallow dames for this
cat

MAX

(AGITATED)
Where did you get this grudge against my
favorite film

CHARLES
Im just kidding around Max Well watch
it tomorrow Tonight theres a party

MAX
And anyway your theory fails to account
for our collective dorkiness and bad
haircuts Plus look at Sam

CHARLES
Sam hasnt seen Annie Hall since freshman
year and hes in his third year with

Jen

MAX
So look at what not watching can do to
you

CHARLES

Ouch Why are you still on this I said I
was kidding

21 INT RADIO STATION -- PRESENT 21

MAX
What a nightmare I dunno why I cant
stop thinking about these things I guess

corner

several small fridges and two televisions in a pile

Christmas lights are still up A neon ‘Guinness sign
dwarfs

one couch and SCOTT and AMANDA sit on the other

Charles puts on his gloves and coat

CHARLES

party

MAX
Who cares Its unnatural If I went into
a strangers house and ate their food
under any other circumstance Id be
arrested

CHARLES
Im not taking no With Sam on board
its gonna be like old times

He gestures at Sam who stands Unlike the hipster from
freshman year Sam now resembles a middle-aged accountant

There are bags under his eyes and square clothes on his
back

SAM
Yeah I havent been out with you guys in
ages

Jen looks up from her magazine with disapproval

JEN
Youre going out

SAM
Aw honey just for a little while

JEN
You know I have to work until midnight
Its not my fault the supervisor wont
let me out of it

She glares He teeters between his friends and his
girlfriend His girlfriend wins He sits back down trying
to

hide his disappointment

SAM
of

She has a point guys I should catch up
on my chemistry reading anyway

The guys roll their eyes let down but unsurprised

Across the room are SCOTT perpetually poker-faced and
reserved and AMANDA understated with the subdued manner

a long-suffering wallflower

She sits off to the side sneaking looks at Scott Hes
watching a golf-related infomercial

AMANDA
So Scott How come youre not going out
with Charles and Max

SCOTT
Cant go Graphic design work

AMANDA
Oh really I have work too but its
okay I got a lot done today What do you

TOMMY
Whats up all

MAX
Tommy at last Save me from this lounge
lizard

CHARLES

TOMMY
Physics lab Fortunately the semesters
just begun so before the work piles up

the semester rules

CHARLES

TOMMY

He disappears into his room Charles takes Maxs hat froma
hook jams it on his head and shoves him towards the door

23 INT COLLEGE APARTMENT LATER 23

A typically lame college party still early in the night
The

furniture is student budget modern type A jazz record

plays quietly while pretentiously-dressed PARTY-GOERS sip

wine and eat cheese and crackers

Max and Charles survey the room drinks in hand

MAX
Cheers to a new semester full of
potential that will surely go to waste

They toast

CHARLES
This is it Im telling you This is the
semester I pass all my classes and meet
the dame of my dreams

MAX
Good luck and may she have a sister

CHARLES
More importantly may she grant us our
occasional freedom

MAX
Ah forget about Sam I dont like it any
more than you

CHARLES
Hes become a total non-entity Freshman
year we were like Frank and Deano Now
its like Frank and freakin Peter
Lawford

MAX
Hey he was one of my best friends Now
we share a room and hes like a stranger

CHARLES
Hottie at 3 oclock Keep an eye on her
for me so it doesnt look like Im
interested

MAX
Yeah right then if you fail to sodomize
her youll blame me Me or Annie Hall

CHARLES
Look all I said was it would explain
our lives

MAX
The problem is every crazy theory
explains something I took a class last
semester with a professor who claimed
that the planet is being destroyed by
white male meat-eating capitalists

CHARLES
So Everybody knows that

MAX

But she had a theory that explained how
apparently racism sexism socialism
environmentalism and vegetarianism are
all inherently linked I brought a Big
Mac to the first class and I thought I
was going to be the victim of a vegan-
socialist uprising

Sam walks in and makes a beeline for the guys

SAM
Hey I made it

CHARLES
I cant believe it

MAX
Wow the laws of nature have stopped
working Maybe I should try to meet some
chicks after all

CHARLES
Howd you get away

SAM
I told her I was going to the lab She

Excitement
doesnt mind if Im working while she is
Hows the party

MAX
Sucks Who are they trying to be with
this wine and cheese What kind of party
doesnt even have beer

CHARLES
I can get into this Its better than
those frat parties Check out the fox in
the beret

SAM
Man its so good to be out Between Jen
homework and labs I hardly have time
for anything

CHARLES
You could always change your major Youd
have a lot more free time

SAM
I feel the same way about science that I
do about Jen Its a lot of work but
its worth it

MORE

SAM (CONTD)
I have doubts about both actually But
still what could be dumber than changing
your major for a girl

MAX
Changing your girl for a major

CHARLES
Would you do it

MAX
It wouldnt be an issue

SAM
Of course not when has studying ever
interfered with whats important like
video hockey or your radio show that
nobody listens to

MAX
I meant Id have to have a girl first
And lay off the radio show Theres a
reason I took the 3am slot

SAM
And every time I see you doing homework
youre taking a break Youre the best
Ive ever seen when it comes to
procrastinating

MAX
I should be procrastination is one of my
favorite hobbies Isnt it funny that my
two favorite hobbies rhyme

Charles expression turns sour as he looks across the room

CHARLES
Oh shit Saras here

SARA good-looking and excitable arrives with a theatrical
flourish Her age and manner indicate among other things
that she is a freshman

SARA
Ta-daaa Hey guys whats going on

SAM

(DEADPAN)
We were just talking about the mediocre
resonations of sub-hybrid fields

MAX
I cant believe you think theyre

mediocre Those guys rock

SARA
(doesnt get it doesnt care)
Oh Well I just wanted to stop by and
say hey to my favorite guys So hey
How was everyones break

She is clearly talking to Charles who is scanning the room
over her shoulder

SAM
Good

MAX
It could have been better but it could
have been worse For me thats good
SARA
Mine was great I partied with my best
friend Melanie who I havent seen in
ages Arent these parties just the best
So much better than the theater group
parties

MAX
I dunno its a bunch of 21-year-olds who
want the 18-year-olds to know how mature
they are

SARA
Hey Charles you going to the fraternity
party after this

CHARLES
Ugh no

SARA
You gonna be back at your suite then
Maybe Ill stop by

CHARLES

many hours

SARA

She tugs on Charless shirt

SARA (CONTD)
(STAGE WHISPER)
I missed you

She leaves

CHARLES
Shit I was hoping to avoid her for at
least a few more days

SAM
What do you have against her She seems
nice

CHARLES
First she makes my skin crawl Second
if word gets out itll ruin my
reputation in the freshman dorms

Sam looks to Max for the real story

MAX
Never hook up with people in your cast

CHARLES
I am a world-class knucklehead

A pretty girl approaches

JULIE

one of you say Max

CHARLES

JULIE

It was hilarious Its not every day
someone calls 1-900-4RIMJOBS to discuss
politics

Sam quickly pulls Charles away as he starts to comment

MAX
And she hung up This isnt the place
for that kind of talk

JULIE
Yeah its like for four dollars a
minute you should talk about whatever
you want You know the countrys in
trouble when a phone sex operator thinks
talking politics is beneath her

MAX
Perhaps shed been screwed by
politicians Phone sex is just pretend
but politics I know my ass is still
sore

He catches himself and falters Julie notices something

JULIE

protective friends It was nice meeting

She appraises him for a beat

JULIE
It was Beth

And with that she leaves Max watches her loses her in the
crowd Something catches his eye across the room

MAXS POV Sam is in a corner trapped by an upset Jen From
his gestures he is on the defensive

Charles moseys over

CHARLES

of work so she went to the lab to
surprise Sam He wasnt there and

Its like you insulted my religion Like
Hey Cardinal I think Jesus might be
why youre not getting laid

about the futility of romance

brave will understand Here is a person
living beyond the walls

MAX
He must have been listening to
Apostrophe at the time

ANDY
Or Prince cuz like Princes name was a
squiggly-thing But Mike wanted something
powerful meaningful and above all
something you could type Therefore
Ampersand Its already on the keyboard

something else

Mark steps forward and pushes up a sleeve

highlight is their exit

JULIE

joke a celebrity DJ would make

JULIE
Oh Mark Hes been following me around
for years Hes easily threatened

MAX
Hes lucky I uh almost pulled a Jackie
Chan on his ass but you know my kung-
fus gotten rusty since I left the Hong
Kong military

JULIE
Dont worry about him he isnt a threat
Youre far more interesting

MAX
Right Asking me not to worry is like
asking a bear to use toilet paper
Theres this joke that sums it up for me

Julie leans in and looks at him with intensity

JULIE
Youre not fooling me you know I can
see right through this aloof image

MAX
What

JULIE
Its not an insult I get the sense that
theres this whole other side of your
personality

MAX
I hope hes a better dancer

JULIE
See this is the side you show playing
everything off as a joke whenever things
gets serious But theres more to you

MAX
Did I ever tell you about the bear and
the rabbit in the woods--

JULIE
Quick Now Tell me something about
yourself something I never would have
guessed And dont even try to come up
with some witty retort

Max agape is on the spot helpless Julie grabs her coat

JULIE (CONTD)

JULIE

You dont know what Im wishing for

MAX
Snowtires

JULIE
Max there are a lot of girls that would
go for a guy like you

JULIE
This is one of those moments in a movie
when a character has a chance to say
something and of course they do and
its perfect and it becomes a movie
moment

Julie starts to lean in Suddenly the BUILDING MANAGER

in Hes a dead ringer for Woody Allen Max starts
MANAGER

Buildings closing Everyone out

47 INT JULIES CAR -- NIGHT 47

Max is relaxed and chatting while Julie drives

MAX
Ive been able to do it since high
school

JULIE

Thats a scary gift I mean even if
people are destined to break up the will
to stay together is very powerful

MAX
Thats the real tragedy Look at all the
unhappy couples in the world

JULIE
I dont know if your gift is really that
special Max I mean we break up with
everyone we ever date Until the one we
stay with forever

MAX
See how ridiculous dating is

JULIE
How did you get this attitude if you love
Annie Hall

MAX
What do you mean Thats what Annies all
about

Julie looks dubious Max flicks on the radio

DJ

thats it for me

Julie are at a table in the corner looking out of place

JULIE

(SMIRKING)
This is a nice place Ritzy Interesting
mix of people here youve got these men
with their suits taking their waitress
girlfriends out to impress them into bed
because they cant get them any other
way Really as if a fast car can ever
make up for a small dick
MAX
If it did do you think Id be here Id
be down at the Porsche dealer with a ski
mask and an Uzi

JULIE
Guys always obsessed with dick size

MAX
Well sure theres that but it would
also be nice to have a car with a heater

JULIE
Lets guess which couples are destined to
break up How about them

Indicates a COUPLE dancing

MAX
No I cant tell just by looking I need
some info

Their waitress DONNA arrives

JULIE
Hi Do you have a boyfriend

Donna puts her pad away

DONNA
So what was that all about then

JULIE
Max here thinks youre going to break up
with your boyfriend

DONNA
What

MAX
Sorry Its all in there You qualified
tall so as not to make him appear too
handsome said friendly like a
euphemism chose fixes cars instead of
the more dignified auto mechanic and
finally mentioned his brother a propos
of nothing like youre threatened by
him

The waitress looks like shes been slapped

she turns her back and walks away

JULIE
Hey Dont shoot the messenger

MAX
Im such an idiot Shes going to shit in
our food now I cant believe you asked
her that

JULIE
Hey were all people here right If you
want to talk to someone talk to them I
dont spend my time trying to justify
talking to people or whatever You limit
yourself if you do that If you spend too
much time worrying you dont spend

After a pause
enough time living right

MAX
What are you a fortune cookie

JULIE
You have to keep yourself open to
possibilities in life Im the first one
in my family to go to college Sometimes
I cant believe Im here at a semi-
prestigious university getting a halfway-
decent education-- this has always been
my dream How did you end up here

MAX
I had a coupon

JULIE
I know what you mean financial aid is a
bitch And the university experience
itself is kind of disappointing All
those rich students with no idea how
lucky they are But I dont think about
them I think about me I think about
where I want to be someday a world
traveler running some huge company or
you know doing some fantastically
important work And when the day comes
that I can relax Im going to charter a
boat sail around the world and see the
Seven Wonders

MAX
I thought they broke up when Stevie left

JULIE
Come on arent you curious about the
world Doesnt the sheer scope of life
fill you with wonder

MAX
Wonder horror its such a fine line

JULIE
Ah Max

But shes smiling at him and he cant help but return it

what Im thinking It was sort of cute
when we were friends but now its like a
proctology exam

(SIGHS)
Hard to imagine a friendship going more
wrong

The image of Beth STOPS on a shot of her looking at him

undisguised disappointment She DISSOLVES into a image of
Julie beaming

MAX (CONTD)
Ah but Julie Juliejuliejulie Shes
smart shes funny isnt constantly
hassling me How she can stay such a

dreamer is beyond me Hey I wonder if
shes listening now

The thought stops him cold The image over his shoulder

kind of magic trick

different lately

You know how when things are going badly
there are certain parts I like to watch

CHARLES
Like how you spent your whole sophomore
year watching that lobster scene on
repeat

watch when things are going well

CHARLES
You know I actually regret mentioning
that theory In fact Sam and I were
thinking of watching it tonight You in

like that I may actually have a chance
with and you want me to put it all in

Donna the waitress glaring at him and hurries after Julie
who is already at the table introducing herself

AMANDA
Beth I cant believe youre graduating
so early
MAX
What really

BETH

Yeah Ive spent my life learning how to
be a student and at the end of the
semester it will all be useless
Everybody already wants to know what Im
going to do and I have no idea I
started making up stories to tell people
An aunt asked me if Im excited about
Chicago and I couldnt remember if Id
said I was moving to the city or going to
see the band

CHARLES
Something similar once happened to me
except I didnt know Nashville Pussy was
a band

Tommy laughs and blows tea out his nose

BETH
I cant believe Im graduating My whole
life Ive known what was next But when
I graduate the next step is something

JULIE
Something that pays the bills

MAX

My grandfather once told me that if you
love your job youll never work a day in
your life Hes 98 years old addicted to
C-SPAN and had to be removed from a
supermarket recently for shouting about
Republicans

JULIE
Now I know where you get it from
it

AMANDA
You should do whatever makes you happy

TOMMY
Grad school baby Stay out of the real
world as long as possible

Sam and Jen sit close together and are both subdued
SAM

I cant believe Im graduating next year
I already have a recurring nightmare

about it

JEN
You have plenty of time dear

She rubs his arm soothingly Behind her back Charles rolls
his eyes and sticks his finger down his throat Sara sees

SARA
Come on Charles show a little dignity

He whirls on her

CHARLES
Dignity Youve been following me around
like a lost dog since break and youre
talking about dignity Youre always in
my way I cant get away from you

SARA
What are you talking about

CHARLES
If theyre making me sick thats my
business Leave me alone already

SARA
Fine

She storms out The table is aghast Julie averts her eyes
politely Beth pokes Max urging him to do something

JEN
We make you sick Sam say something to
him
SAM
Why should I Weve made him sick for
years

How dare you

SAM
Its true

Beth smacks Maxs leg Do something He begs off

JEN
You think everythings okay if its true
but some things are true and not okay

SAM
When are you going to realize Ima
different person and entitled to my
opinion Its my goddamn life

Jen turns away glaring Max anxiously looks at Julie who
stares above her menu

AMANDA

Sara comes back in and sits down sullen There is a long
uncomfortable silence

A WAITER arrives

The waiter looks around notices the tension

WAITER

JULIE

JEN

JULIE

Oh sorry I just meant I needed
something more ya know relevant

SAM
Psych is relevant

JULIE

(SLIGHTLY DEFENSIVE)
Well look Im only in college for the
degree Most of the stuff they teach us
is pointless anyway

Julie looks at Max Say something

MAX

(FEEBLY)
Heheh I bet thats why they call it
academic
JEN
College is a great opportunity Its
about more than getting a job

JULIE
Yeah its about avoiding the real world
for as long as possible

CHARLES
I work in theater so this is great
training for me

JULIE
You call theater the real world

SARA
Hey

Now Julie is hitting Maxs leg Help me out here But Max is
petrified watching his worst nightmare unfold

JEN
Some of us work really hard to get
through school

JULIE
Look my parents worked their whole lives
to give me the opportunity to be here
But the truth is private schools like
ours make money by showing students a
good time for four years Its bullshit

AMANDA
You think social work is bullshit

JULIE

Thats not what I--
CHARLES

This bullshit is going to put me in

debt for the next forty years

Julie punches Max in the thigh He jumps blinks
JEN

Why dont you just drop out if

everythings such bullshit

MAX

refreshingly positive

DISSOLVE TO
92 INT COMMON ROOM -- 98 MINUTES LATER 92

The closing credits are rolling Max and Julie look
somewhat
disconcerted

MAX
Boy what an uplifting movie Such a

refreshingly positive message

She doesnt respond

MAX (CONTD)
Right

JULIE
You know I think I prefer Manhattan

MAX
How can you say that Annie Hall is so
uplifting

JULIE

Its just deeper more sophisticated I
guess Listen thanks for dinner and the
movie tonight but I should get going

MAX
But its still early

Julie goes to the door Max follows He tries to kiss her
She pulls back

JULIE
I dont know if this is a good idea right
now

MAX
Okay how about right now

He tries to kiss her again She ducks it comes back into
the
room sits down Max stands tense

JULIE
Listen since the other night Ive been
doing some thinking

MAX
Theres your mistake Mindless happiness
is always better than thoughtful
reservation Unless youre talking about
nude bungee jumping

JULIE
I dont think that this is a good time
for us to jump or leap or whatever you
know together Into a relationship

MAX
But but we just saw a movie about how
relationships are worth it no matter
what happens

JULIE
Did we

MAX
Yeah I guess we really did

JULIE
Well youre right Max and this
relationship was worth it

MAX
Was Is Wait Oh shit

Max covers his face breathes deep

JULIE
Are you okay Will you please calm down
I like you very much but I told you I
just got out of a serious relationship
and it ended really badly We saw each
other almost every day at the beginning
but by the end of the semester I hadnt
seen him in a month He stopped returning
my calls and stuff and I mean he
basically avoided me then I heard he was
seeing one of my friends

MAX
But that was him not me

JULIE
Its nobodys fault I know I mean Ive
been trying but its hard Relationships
are very difficult to maintain There are
so few successful couples

MAX
Whats successful Like my parents have
been married thirty years but--

JULIE
My parents are divorced

MAX
Okay bad example But why think ahead
Were here now Cant we just enjoy our
time together
JULIE
Max I did believe me

MAX

What was all this I mean was any of it

JULIE
I dont know what I was doing I didnt
think about where this might lead until
it was too late

MAX
But it might lead to happiness

Tommy walks in half asleep in his pajamas

He turns on the

TV and sits down Max stares at him Tommy suddenly realizes

he isnt alone

TOMMY
Uh re-run

He turns it off and quickly exits Max tries to pull himself

together

JULIE
Say something Are you okay

MAX
I knew that damn film was cursed Why did
I listen to Charles instead of Annie

JULIE
Jesus Max Its not an anti-relationship
movie

MAX
What are you talking about Its a
fucking textbook

She stands

JULIE
Youre not listening to me Max Just
like youre not listening to Annie No
matter what you think right now this was
worth it Because I got to meet you and
got to be close to you
an

Amanda

MAX
I know I dont know I mean Good-bye

Julie leaves The VCR whirs to a stop and Annie Hall ejects
Max stares at it upset and thoughtful

TITLE CARD white on black SUNDAY

93 INT COMMON ROOM -- LATE AFTERNOON 93

PAN left to right across peoples chests an X-Files shirt
lounge shirt with a wide collar a Stephen Hawking shirt
Ani DiFranco shirt

PULL BACK to reveal 1 to r Sam Charles Tommy and

sprawled on the couches from Maxs POV in the doorway

fq

Theyre drinking vodka out of coffee mugs The TV is on but
the sound is off Everyone looks tired and sad

Max sits Sam thumbs a copy of Scientific American

SAM
Why are humans smarter than chimps if we
have 99 of the same genetic material

MAX
Who says were smarter

SAM
Look who Im asking You think a red
blood cell is a prison for a gang member

MAX
Very funny Mr Wizard If I learned
anything useful in my classes Id be
rubbing it in your face

In Scotts usual spot is Amanda and Tommy

TOMMY
So Amanda Have a good weekend

AMANDA
Yeah

TOMMY
Mine was good too Get any good birthday
presents

AMANDA
Yeah

She gets up and leaves the room

SAM
By the way Max what ever happened with
that girl you were seeing

MAX
She just ended a long relationship and

she doesnt want anything serious

CHARLES
Cant you have something thats not so
serious

MAX
No its dead And the thing I dont get
is it was all going so well There was a
moment when we kissed when it was more
than a kiss

His openness is making the other guys uncomfortable

MAX (CONTD)

t was like we broke through all our
layers you know all the manners and
defense mechanisms and daily crap and I
saw a flash of something a glimmer of
hope or happiness or whatever something
inspired in her But now its over and
ll never see that part of her again

CHARLES
think youre upset about not seeing
some other parts of her again

The joke is half-hearted-- Max has made everyone reflective

CHARLES (CONTD)
Shes a girl Max Theyll always be a
mystery Youll never know why they love
you and youll never know why they dont

SAM
Relationships are incredibly complicated
Like polypeptide strings Theres an
attraction at first but if the bonds
dont form right away nothing can make
the connection work

MAX
Theres a metaphor we can all relate to

SAM
It was like with Jen and I But I know it
was for the best

CHARLES
I finally dropped out of the play I was
directing just to get rid of Sara God
my career is in shambles

TOMMY
Tough week all around huh How about
some video hockey

Max gets up and puts on his coat

MAX
I think I prefer Goldeneye

He leaves Sam sighs and picks up the remote

SAM
Wanna watch Sports Center

CHARLES
Nah I think Im gonna call Sara

He gets up and leaves as Sam registers this news He puts
the
remote down

94 EXT CAMPUS GREEN DUSK 94

It is moist and foggy as Max trudges across the deserted
campus

BETH (0S)
Max
Max stops in the middle of a path as Beth walks up

BETH (CONTD)
Hi there Happy Valentines Day

MAX
Oo witty

BETH
Yeah I hate Valentines Day too If
youre in love youre in love And if
youre not who wants to think about it
I want to be in love so badly dont you

MAX

BETH
Ah forget it Max

MAX
You know the joke

BETH
Does a bear shit in the woods

MAX
Yeah thats the one

BETH

You told it the night of our date I hate
that joke Max Its not a philosophy

MAX
But I think I know what it means now

BETH
Yeah and its dreary and depressing
right
MAX
Not this time
BETH
No
MAX
(INTIMATELY)

Beth I just want to say before its all
over and I dont have the chance that
Im sorry For everything Last semester
and last year

Beth is speechless she never though shed ever hear that

MAX (CONTD)
You mean the world to me and I was an
idiot to throw it away You were right
if I cant be a friend to you how could
I be a boyfriend Ive done a lot of
things wrong and Ive been confused as
hell but I think its time for a change

Beth looks him over as if for the first time

BETH
Really

MAX
Really

BETH

Then allow me to recommend a movie that
youve never seen before Its called
Annie Hall

MAX
I was going to see it tonight Do you
want to join me

BETH
I would love to but I think you need to

do this alone

MAX
No youre right

BETH
But Ill see you later

MAX
Sure After the movie Im doing my last
radio show Its going to be all
requests You should tune in

BETH
The end of an era
MAX
The start of a new one

He smiles and walks away The fog begins to obscure him

Beth opens her backpack and removes a Walkman She hits
POWER

and the LED changes from TAPE to RADIO

MAX (VO) (contd)

And thats how I let go of her Although
its probably more honest to say that she
let go of me Julie Beth and Annie
Three women in my life and I was
desperate for one

REVERSE ANGLE Beth stands alone watching him go She snaps
the headphones over her ears

MAX (VO) (contd)

Of course I saw her again Its a small
campus The last time was at a film
festival Were better friends now then
ever and theres always a chance we can
have some kind of future together So
far so good

Finally Beth turns and walks away

CUT BACK TO Max still walking getting smaller and smaller
Soon all we see is fog

MAX (VO) (contd)

Shell always mean a lot to me and its
nice to run into her and reminisce about
what we ya know went through It was a
weird period of my life I mean shit I
really got off track there didnt I
