by Jonathan Lawton and Stephen Metcalfe

EXT A HOUSE IN THE HOLLYWOOD HILLS - NIGHT

The view of downtown Los Angeles from the enormous ornate house
is extraordinary A small outdoor dinner party is in progress

A MAGICIAN is entertaining guests Playing cards and coins
appear and disappear in his nimble hands

INT HOUSE STUDY - NIGHT

EDWARD HARRIS stands at the window impassively looking down
at the party Edward is a handsome well groomed man of around
forty He looks tired the kind of fatigue that cant be cured
by a nights sleep

EDWARD
(a murmur)
Left pocket

And indeed down below the magician pulls the coin from the
left pocket of the incredulous WOMANs silk blazer More
laughter and applause

The study is in keeping with the rest of the house Luxurious
Everything the best WILLIAM STUCKEY Edwards contemporary
is a crafty looking lawyer who is the party host VANCE is an
investment banker His assistant JAKE is a financial
researcher The other men are INVESTMENT BANKERS They are

in dark suits and power ties On the table are stacks of
documents and folders the name KROSS INDUSTRIES is prominent
on many of the folders

INVESTMENT BANKER 1
Our banks certainly doesnt want
to discourage Harris Enterprises
from investing in California
We think this is a great new venue
for you but youve got to
understand the mergers and
acquisitions market is changing
With the upswing in inflation we
have to make these offerings
tempting to offset the risk

VANCE
Look were talking about hard
assets and a straight liquidation
We have over a thousand man hours
in this deal

STUCKEY
(losing patience)
This is a no brainer Theres
no risk for you No one has ever
lost money backing Mr Harris

INVESTMENT BANKER 2
Not yet But ship building is
a new endeavor for you

STUCKEY
(cuts him off)
Come on You know were not
going to go into ship building
Besides youre the ones with the
troubled track record not us

INVESTMENT BANKER 3
Bill be reasonable If youre
really going to digest Kross
Industries that quickly eighteen
should not be such a problem
Besides I dont think theres
anywhere else you can go for the
money in the time you have

EDWARD
Its unacceptable

Edward turns from the window He hasnt miss a thing All
eyes are on him

EDWARD
Draymen Heux has offered me
seventy-five in the pool at
sixteen and a half I can secure
the other half personally You
have until tomorrow morning to
make me a better offer

The bankers speechlessly stare at him

EDWARD
The meeting is over gentlemen

He turns away The bankers look at one another They rise
Silence as they exit When the door closes Stuckey explodes
with laughter
STUCKEY
Hah Did you see the look on
their faces

VANCE
You dont think we pushed too
hard

STUCKEY
NO way Theyll come back They
cant afford not to Edward
that bluff was beautiful

EDWARD
Maybe I should have made it
rhyme

The others stare at him uncertain Stuckey laughs The
others follow suit

EDWARD
(looking at his watch)
Well Its late Weve been
at this long enough

Stuckey rises Edward ushers Vance and Jake toward the door

EDWARD
Gentlemen enjoy the party The
magicians wonderful

watching throws up his hands

his office He stares in surprise and displeasure as he sees
Vivian exit out the front door Vivian doesnt notice the odd
stares she gets from two well-dressed MIDDLE-AGED WOMEN who are
just entering

EXT RODEO DRIVE - DAY

Vivian is looking wide-eyed and delighted and yes more than

a bit overwhelmed She passes store windows and MORE STORE
WINDOWS and still MORE STORE WINDOWS Each display is more
beautiful and expensive than the one before

Vivian is also aware that she is getting odd looks From
PASSERBYS Two beautiful dressed GIRLS her own age look at
her turn away and giggle The uniformed GUARDS that stand at
attention in front of many of the stores stare at her
suspiciously

Feeling more and more uncomfortable Vivian comes to a posh
womans boutique She hesitates for a moment She enters

INT BOUTIQUE - DAY

Vivian is no sooner in the door than she is subject to the
disapproving stare of a SALESWOMAN standing behind the counter

SALESWOMAN
(cooly)

Vivian tiptoes through the shop as if it was filled with
delicate glass objects She cautiously examines a dress The
Saleswoman quickly comes around the counter and approaches her

SALESWOMAN

Yes Something conservative
SALESWOMAN

Yes

Vivian eyes the Saleswoman puzzled at her tone She examines
a dress

VIVIAN
You have beautiful things

(beginning to get the
drift)
I didnt ask if it would fit

Vivians body tenses as she stares at the Saleswoman

VIVIAN
What is with you

SALESWOMAN
(unblinking)
Excuse me

VIVIAN

SALESWOMAN

for you here Youre obviously

She stops and spins around staring at the Saleswoman Vivian
flips her off She throws the door open and storms outside
The Saleswoman calmly strolls back to her counter and returns
to her place

an emptiness in her stomach at the sight of all the luxury

looks back at them innocently With a smooth gesture Mr Thomas
waves the Operator over

MR THOMAS
(surprised)

comfortable chair and then leans against the edge of his desk

MR THOMAS

VIVIAN
Vivian
MR THOMAS

manner

Vivians face screws up as she tries hard not to cry

VIVIAN
Thats what I was trying to do

She cant help it the tears come Vivian pulls out the money

looking wad now

He starts towards the lounge
MR THOMAS
Very intriguing young woman Miss
Vivian
His tone stops Edward in his tracks

MR THOMAS (contd)
Have a good evening sir

And off he goes leaving Edward to wonder what the hell
transpired during the afternoon

INT HOTEL LOUNGE - NIGHT

Edward enters the lounge He looks around not seeing Vivian
And suddenly his eyes go back to the beautiful girl with the
beautifully styled hair in the beautiful black cocktail dress
at the piano bar Edward tries to hide his surprise as Vivian
rises moves elegantly towards him She smiles

VIVIAN
Youre late

Such a beautiful woman deserves an apology and so without
thinking

EDWARD
Im sorry

VIVIAN
Youre forgiven

She waits expectantly He holds out an arm She takes it

INT REX RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Vivian comes out of the ladies room She walks forward past
the MAITREDS station She stops She takes a breath and
then walks forward

INT REX - ANOTHER ANGLE - LOOKING DOWN

Vivian moves down a marble starircase through the elegant
restaurant toward a far table Her beauty and natural grace
draw approving stares She is like a queen moving through a
ballroom

At a secluded table Edward sits in conversation with two men
JAMES KROSS in his early 70s a bulky self-made millionaire
industrialist Sitting next to him is his son and second in
command DAVID KROSS a handsome man in his early thirties
All of them rise as Vivian comes to the table David Kross
holds out Vivians chair for her Surprised she nods her
thanks In front of her is an enormous placesetting She
smiles down at the utensils filled with confidence

Waiters have placed a delicate salad down in front of each of
them Vivian proudly reaches for her salad fork But then she
sees that Kross has picked up the fork closest to his plate and
is digging into his salad with that

Vivian looks to see what Edward will do He doesnt seem
interested in eating yet Neither does David Kross Feeling
a sudden panic Vivian puts her fork down

KROSS
So young man I understand you
are trying to take over my
company

A moment The abruptness of the question takes Edward back for
a moment But then he almost smiles

EDWARD
Please dont patronize me Mr
Kross Our ages mean nothing
here

Kross and David look at each other

DAVID
Mr Harris we know youve
purchased at least twenty percent
of our stock We also know you
plan to file a formal bid for a
majority share

EDWARD
Twenty-five percent

KROSS
Mr Harris I built Kross
Enterprises myself I know every
man who ever worked there by his
first name I know their wives
and their children If your
intention is to take over my
company and turn it into a
glorified real estate deal think
again

Edward thankfully now reaches for his salad fork and begins
to eat Relieved Vivian picks up hers They all eat for a
moment

EDWARD
What do you suggest Mr Kross

WAITERS approach some to clear the salad plates some to put
down the next course Vivian thinking shes got to finish
quickly stuffs her mouth with the rest of her salad She is
reluctant to let the Waiter take her fork

KROSS
What would it take to buy our
stock back Name your price

EDWARD
To get me in a mood to sell --
double what I paid But your
company doesnt have enough
capital right now to buy anything

DAVID
Were on the verge of closing
a large navy contract Double
is ridiculous but we can assure
you a healthy profit on your
shares We would give you a
promissory note

EDWARD
Youre not getting any navy
contracts

Vivian can see that both father and son are stunned by this
news

DAVID
Theres no way you could know
that

EDWARD

But I do know I also know your
lines of credit are over-extended
If I dont buy your company
someone else will

(looking up)
Ah the escargot

Escargot are put down in front of everyone Vivian stares at
them dubiously She picks up what she assumes is the next
right fork She picks up a snail The two do not fit
Flustered she doesnt know what to do No one else seems to
be eating And now a Waiter comes and places escargot forks
at each place Vivian picks it up with a sigh of relief

VIVIAN
(softly to the Waiter)
Scume me what are these things

WAITER
(bending to whisper)
Escargot mademoiselle

EDWARD
(leaning close to
whisper)

Snails

Vivian stares at them horrified She like James and David
Kross no longer seem interested in eating Edward eats with
pleasure

EDWARD
Mr Kross Im not here to sell
you my stock On the contrary
Im here to buy yours

KROSS
(angry)
Youve got a lot of nerve

EDWARD
No What I have is a lot of
money

KROSS

I know all about you Mr Harris
When you buy companies they have
a way of disappearing Even the
pension funds are stripped clean
The last three companies you took
over were cut up in so many
pieces widows were left without
their retirement checks

EDWARD
(calmly)
What I did with those companies
was perfectly legal

KROSS
I dont question the legality
of what you do Its your
morality that makes me sick I
will not allow my company to be
raped by a man like you

EDWARD
(angry now)
It is not your company Its a
public company And I am going
to acquire it Either I buy from
the other stock holders or I buy
from you

Vivian struggles with her escargot

EDWARD (contd)
I would suggest that you and your
board cooperate with me rather
than fight a battle you dont have
the ammunition to win

Vivian suddenly ZINGS her snail across the table Everyone
looks to her

VIVIAN
Slippery little suckers

Kross rises

KROSS
If youll excuse me young lady
Mr Harris
(turns to David)
Deal with this David you know
where we stand I need to go
someplace and puke

He rises He exits

DAVID
(to Edward and Vivian)
Men like my father built this
country He was no saint He
screwed people But for every
guy he stepped on he gave a
hundred a good job

Edward is silent

each other Aw he was sweet
And boy was he good looking
yknow dark hair and eyes
The chicken hawks were on him all
the time He hated that
Sometimes wed find a safe place
to crash nights and wed curl up
together and wed talk about all
these crazy things The two of
us getting married someday
Having kids Stupid stuff

EDWARD
What happened to him

moment Vivian shrugs

VIVIAN

My father found me Dragged me
home I dont know why he never
seemed to like me much when I was
there

(a bitter smile)
Cept when he was drunk then he
liked me a whole lot

(a moment)
I made it back to Atlanta a year
later Andy was gone
Silence Vivian stares out the window

VIVIAN
Aw but things sure look fine
when youre sitting way up high

Edward moves close to Vivian and putting an arm around her
shoulders stares with her out at the view Vivian rests her
head against him

EXT SAN FRANCISCO OPERA HOUSE - NIGHT

An airport limo pulls to a stop in front of the San Francisco
Opera House The DRIVER walks around back and opens the
passenger door Edward emerges and helps Vivian out

INT SF OPERA HOUSE LOBBY - NIGHT

Edward puts his hand on Vivians elbow as they walk through
the elegant lobby

EDWARD
Some people say that opera is an
acquired taste but I dont
believe it You can always tell
when someone goes to the opera
for the first time They either
love it or hate it Those who
love it will always love it those
who hate it might come to
appreciate it but theyll never
truly love it

Vivian is wide eyed as they walk past a beautifully lit
fountain with several graceful statues in its center
Everywhere she looks she sees elegantly dressed WOMEN and
prosperous looking MEN It makes her nervous Without
realizing it she raises a protective hand up to her necklace
She looks as if she suspects someone is going to step up and
steal it

EDWARD
Viv I really doubt if anyone
here is going to try and grab it

Vivian reluctantly lowers her hands
INT SF OPERA HOUSE LOBBY - ANOTHER ANGLE - NIGHT
A crowd of PEOPLE mill around the lobby heading toward their

seats Vivian is aware of the looks she draws as she passes
-- curious even envious looks from the WOMEN appreciative
glances from the MEN Her hands again rises nervously to her
necklace

EDWARD
They all think you look very
beautiful Vivian

Vivian gives him a grateful look Relaxing she lowers her hand
from the necklace With a flourish he offers his arm She
takes it They start forward

INT SF OPERA HOUSE BOX - NIGHT

Edward and Vivian take their seats in a box high above the
stage

VIVIAN
If its in Italian how will I
know what theyre saying

EDWARD
Ill whisper some of the main
parts of the story to you But
youll be surprised how much you
understand The music conveys
the story more powerfully than
any words

VIVIAN
But dont they have it in
English

EDWARD
Vivian dont be afraid of what
you dont know Thats the fun
of it

The lights dim
VIVIAN
(resigned)
Okay Even if I hate it Im
glad you brought me

The orchestra begins to play Vivians eyes focus intensely
on the stage as if a new world is about to be revealed to her

INT SF OPERA HOUSE STATE - NIGHT
IN A MONTAGE OF IMAGES AND MUSIC - LA BOHEME is performed

The lights from the stage dance across Vivians face Edward
leans over to translate the tenors aria

EDWARD
What am I I ama poet Not
a man of wealth but one rich in
dreams You have come to replace
my vanished dreams I dwell now
only in your eyes

The MUSIC ebbs and swells The sets and costumes change The
story continues

Edward again leans close to Vivian

EDWARD
And now she asks Rudolpho if he
still thinks her beautiful --

Vivian raises a hand and gently covers Edwards mouth Her eyes
are fixed on the stage She doesnt need his help

The emotions building inside Vivian swell as the music is
reaching its tragic climax Her lips tremble Her eyes fill
with tears Edward glances at her He studies her a long
moment watching the emotions play unashamedly across her face
Strangely moved he takes Vivians hand

As the opera ends they are both swept away by it
INT SF OPERA HOUSE BOX - NIGHT

As the lights come up Vivian wipes off her tear-ruined
mascara She sighs happy The WOMEN in the next box smile
at her

OLDER WOMAN
Did you enjoy the opera dear

VIVIAN
(tearfully)
It was so beautiful I just about
pissed my pants

Edward smiles at the now shocked looking Older Woman and he
and the still misty Vivian exit

VIVIAN

EDWARD

VIVIAN

EDWARD
Yes Ive never enjoyed it more

Vivian looks at him a moment And then leaning slowly forward
she kisses him gently on the mouth He looks at her surprise
He puts his arms around her and kisses her back It is the
first time theyve kissed and they make it very special

gently kisses the palm

VIVIAN

She clutches Edwards hand tightly to her breast She closes
her eyes ready to sleep now

She comes over starts to tie his tie for him He is very
aware of the closeness of her She smiles at him He smiles
puts his hand on her stopping her for a moment Looking up

his surprise

An angry reluctant looking David Kross is behind his father

perfunctory nod Stuckey smugly winks at Edward Edward closes
the door and leads them all down the stairs

Vivian is very troubled at Krosss appearance He gently nods
at Vivian

KROSS
Of course yes After the

EDWARD
(a moment)

Stuckey glances triumphantly at Edward He is surprised to
see that there doesnt seem to be any victory in Edwards face
Edward is silent Kross interprets his silence as second
thoughts

KROSS
Ill see you on one condition

INT BROKERAGE HOUSE - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

Edward stands at the window looking out There is something
about his somber demeanor that both reflects the look weve just
seen on Vivian and suggests the way we saw him at the top of

the story

Jake enters a pile of papers under his arm He begins laying
them out on the conference table

JAKE
Congratulations sir

EDWARD
What

JAKE
Mr Kross is just getting off
the phone with his stock broker
Its finished Youve won

Edward says nothing

JAKE

He turns as Stuckey James and David Kross and Vance enter
the room They surround a conference table Kross sits the
papers laid out in front of him Stuckey hands Kross a pen
A SECRETARY lays out finger food They wait for her to leave
before they speak

STUCKEY
If we can get these letters of
intent out of the way now Mr

Harris and I would like to ask
you some questions about your
company

DAVID
Dad excuse me but thats
inappropriate Youre under no
obligation to answer any questions
at all

KROSS
Could we at least wait till after
the filing period

Stuckey glances to Edward for help

Edward is silent indeed

its as if something is twisting inside of him Stuckey plunges

ahead

STUCKEY
Mr Harris is preparing a bid
based on our speculation of the
corporations net worth The
price he ultimately pays for your
fathers stock will be based on
that bid The more we know the
higher our bid can be

KROSS
Its in my best interest to
cooperate David

DAVID
If he throws himself on your
sword you promise to take care
of him and his family huh

David stares at him

STUCKEY
Thats unfair

DAVID

You bed it is

(to Edward)
Youre everything he said you
were

(to his father)
Do what you have to do Dad
Just dont expect me to watch it

He exits A moment Kross looks at Edward with a resigned

smile

KROSS
Hes young He hasnt learned
how to lose gracefully yet Ill
sign your papers And Ill answer
your questions Whatever you
want

He sighs He picks up the pen Hes about to sign

EDWARD
Stop For just a moment

(a moment)
Mr Kross Id like to ask you
a few questions before you sign
You realize that youre a target
If you werent mine youd be
someone elses correct

KROSS
Yes
EDWARD
If you had a reprieve what

would do

STUCKEY
(quickly)
I dont think theres any sense
in --
EDWARD

Let him answer

KROSS
I I would take advantage of
it

EDWARD
How

Kross looks uncertain He gropes for an answer

KROSS
I I dont know There
there wasnt time

EDWARD
I suppose youd find out soon
enough that you have assets you
presently dont seem aware of
wouldnt you The waste
processing licenses at that
abandoned shipyard of yours youd
certainly find out about that

Surprise suddenly flares in Stuckeys eyes

STUCKEY
Oh my god Edward no

EDWARD
I suppose youd use them as
collateral on new loans wouldnt
you

STUCKEY
Have you lost your mind

KROSS
(to Stuckey)
Quiet
(to Edward)
Would I get the loans

EDWARD

This time I imagine you would
yes

(as if thinking about

it)
Hmm
(a moment)
With all this in mind Mr Kross
I cant logically make a formal
bid on your company can I

KROSS
(a small smile)
Youd be initiating a financial
battle youd ultimately lose Mr
Harris

EDWARD
Youre very right I think the
best thing we could all do is go
home

STUCKEY
What

EDWARD
Have a good day gentlemen

He exits from the room Stuckey follows

starts rubbing up against her

INT VIVIANS APARTMENT - DAY

Vivian sits on her bed lost in thought Her bags are packed
ready to go With a sigh she rises She picks up the bags
exits the room

Vivian stands in the dreary living room looking at it taking
it all in for the last time She suddenly looks more than a
little bit frightened to be leaving She musters resolve She
goes to the door opens it and exits closing it behind her
Silence Vivian suddenly comes back in She puts down her
bags She crosses to the kitchen where she takes coffee
canpiggy bank from the shelf She puts some more bills into
it places it back where Kit will find it

She turns and starts again for the door

She stops She hears something MUSIC An aria from La

Boheme Faint Seemingly coming from nowhere She dismisses
it -- shes hearing things She opens the door Stops The
music is louder and getting louder now -- its not her
imagination She hurries over to the window

EXT VIVIANS APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY
Vivian comes out onto the fire escape She stares in wonder

A snow white limo comes up the street A necktie has been tied
to the antennae like a knights token The MUSIC from La Boheme
is BLARING from the cars stereo Edward is standing on the
cars seat his head and body up through the open sunroof The
wind blows at his hair He is smiling

Everywhere on the street people are staring the BUMS the
PUSHERS the PASSERBYS the TOURISTS
Vivian doesnt know whether to laugh or cry

The car comes to a stop in front of the Vivians building

Vivians landlord comes out the front door His eyes go wide

in disbelief

Edward disembarks from the limo by coming up through the

sunroof He leaps nimbly to the ground He crosses to the entrance

of the alleyway looking up at Vivian on the fire escape

VIVIAN
You are really lost this time

Edward wordlessly holds up a hand for her
With a sudden cry of joy Vivian comes down the fire escape
She stops at the bottom stair Edward comes forward and sweeps

her into his arms They kiss

He carries her to the limo as if shes weightless Her feet
never touch the ground

The car door closes behind them The limo drives away
The people of the street watch it go

THE END
