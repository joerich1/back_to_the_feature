EXT HOLLYWOOD HILLS NIGHT

A modern house packed with dark-clad figures clings to the
edge of a precipice Its lights are blurred in the sort of
fog that Angelenos call a marine layer

In the road that curves past and below the house VALETS are
silently taking and parking (driving off to park) expensive

cars Valets in their white shirt-fronts are running up and

down the road

The people going up to the house do not seem to be party-
goers they are all male mostly grave primarily Asian
businessmen

A fogged view of the valet area is revealed by a sudden sweep
of WIPERS We reverse to see

A BMW 1 series the 1M the orange killer standing pulled
over against the curb under a spray of somebodys
bougainvillea The car is idling It contains only the
driver

INT BMW NIGHT

A BRASS ZIPPO lighter is clicked open shut open shut

The driver JIM — the gambler of the piece — is watching the
house Close on his calculating eyes

The LIGHTER clicks open shut open shut and then a

decision is made JIM puts the lighter in the pocket of his
dark suit and gets abruptly out of the car

EXT THE STREET IN THE HOLLYWOOD HILLS NIGHT

JIM walks downhill towards the valet area He is tall well
dressed thirty five He needs a shave he’s tieless and
looks like he might have been up for five days straight but
he has decent style a natural suavity

A FILIPINO VALET notes him and the car

VALET
You bring car here

JIM
Already got a space buddy

He looks up at the LIGHTED HOUSE then at the VALET
JIM (CONTD)
I’ve got a lucky face

THE VALET stares authority challenged flummoxed as

JIM with a glance back goes up the steep stairs under
flaring torches

In the undergrowth we see (and JIM sees) that a FOR SALE sign
has been toppled over and badly hidden

After following JIM briefly through the gardens over the
brick paths and past big SECURITY MEN (multi-ethnic) one of
whom nods as JIM appears we go to

JIMS POV to enter the house to move through the packed
rooms There is a girl inside with a GUEST LIST She knows
him makes a mark

The rooms done up around the edges as a temporary bottle
service gambling club are full of serious gamblers Again
mostly Asian but with some serious casuals a few hip-
hoppers It’s a catered affair The same sort of casually
employed actors and models and students that move around with
drinks and food on trays at any party in Hollywood

JIM moves through the rooms noting

TABLE AFTER TABLE all of them in heavy play by very heavy
gamblers

Through a door apart we see a POKER GAME going on heavy
hitters JIM moves on observing everything ready for
anything looking for what he needs the game he needs

A STUDENT-WAITRESS (AMY) for a moment might be it but
after making serious eye contact and a moment in which JIM
and AMY register each other without affect and he shakes his
head very slightly to reject either a canape or something
much more complicated she moves on through the crowd He
keeps moving She keeps moving

They seem to know each other from another context and it’s
rattled Jim to see her here

Near the MONEY changing hands at an improvised CAISSE where
a woman in specs trades colored plaques for cash in the Asian
casino manner KOREAN HEAVIES stand guard earpieced armed
(The security guys outside are any security guys the inner
sanctum is Korean)

JIM goes to the caisse table reaches into his coat and
pulls out ten thousand-odd dollars in a wrapper He waits
watches as
His MONEY is counted

And as

THE PLAQUES are shoved across

As JIM gathers up the plaques and puts them in his coat he
notices an older tough grave civil unreadable Korean man

MISTER LEE looking at him carefully

MISTER LEE
You do better tonight

JIM nods

JIM
Couldn’t do worse

They look at each other JIM has his game face but MISTER
LEE always has his MISTER LEE nods and though it’s subtle

allows JIM to pass on through into the big crowded high-
ceilinged room

CUT TO

INT THE BLACKJACK AREA NIGHT LATER

SPECTATORS are watching MISTER LEE moves up to watch

JIM the only player at the table with at least eight times
more plaques in front of him than we saw him buy absolutely
intent on the game shoves 40K in plaques forward and is
dealt a

CARD DOWN and a JACK UP

JIM checks his down card and sees a 4 and looks up at the
dealer like a duellist marking his man

The DEALER (KOREAN an at-sea family man who really shouldn’t
be doing this really shouldn’t be in these circumstances)
realizes he’s in it and is very nervous

JIM
Double down make it twenty
thousand

The DEALER looks over at MISTER LEE who nods his approval
JIM gets a king He’s lost His on-table pile is raked away

He smiles and then deliberately enjoying it he pushes in
the last of his RESERVED CHIPSall of them
JIM (CONTD)
(to uncertain sweating
dealer)
Mister Lee can cover a lot more
than that buddy
(a beat)
You must be new

MISTER LEE again has to nod his approval

The sweating DEALER deals

JIM is given a card down and a 2 showing The DEALER has a
queen showing JIM looks at him again briefly then flips
his down card sees a 7 and tucks it under his 2 After
catching the eye of the passing

AMY

In the crowd

JIM (CONTD)
(off something about Amy)
Let’s go for it brother
(this means something
about Amy)
Double it

JIM takes a card down flicks it up with his 7 card It is an
ace He is unmoved

The DEALER turns up his down card a 5 then draws a 6 for
21 We stay on the cards long enough to count them

JIMS COUNTERS are scraped away by the house
MISTER LEE moves indifferently away through the crowd
ON JIM

JIM is entirely without affect as if losing money was
exactly what he wanted to be done with it

He pulls out a single RED 500 dollar counter looks at it
turns it in his hand in the well-done light puts it back in
his pocket

A bejeweled COURTLY GANGSTA (NEVILLE) beside him (and his
POSSE never far from Neville)

NEVILLE
I hope you paid your rent homes

JIM looks at him perfectly capable of either glassing him
walking away

JIM
I don’t pay rent Homes

After this (ambiguity) is taken on board

NEVILLE

You got a problem an issue of some
kind

JIM
Yeah I don’t like your fuckin’
hat

JIM is quite obviously a gambler in many aspects of life

NEVILLE and POSSE exchange glances DANGEROUS KOREANS have
moved in at the hint of trouble

JIM (CONTD)
(quietly to Neville’s ear)
I think you kinda want me to have
an issue so I thought of that one

JIM tosses down his drink chews his ice and stares at
Neville

JIM (CONTD)
I got plenty of issues A dangerous
guy in a hats only one of them
Whats yours

NEVILLE
See you outside motherfucker

JIM turns back and spreads his arms

JIM
Well we all gotta go out sometime
Its never when you want it and
its always gonna hurt
(turns back leans in)
You a gambler

NEVILLE
Not like you

JIM
You dont know what I am Thats
the first thing you should know

JIM looks intently at him inches away

or
JIM (CONTD)
You want to fuck around or do you
want to cut cards for 500

NEVILLE looks at him at the raised 500 PLAQUE

NEVILLE
I put ten grand against your five
hundred Is that gambler enough for
you

JIM
I haven’t got ten grand That’s an
unequal bet

The courtly NEVILLE indicates his smoldering POSSE

NEVILLE
It’s an unequal general situation

JIM appreciates that

JIM
Oh I like odds
(holding out palm to the
wide-eyed DEALER not
looking at him)
Give us a deck

One is shuffled JIM takes it walks with Neville to a nearby
small bar where champagne is set up puts the deck down and
nods at NEVILLE who cuts first and showswith great
reluctance

The KING OF SPADES

JIM amused looks up at NEVILLE who is not amused at all

JIM (CONTD)
That’s funny

NEVILLE
I thought you wanted my business
card

The deck is reshuffled and JIM cuts revealing and taking up
to look at a JACK OF HEARTS

AMY is watching
JIM looks at her and then looks down

She turns away
JIM tosses the card on the table and holds out the 500
marker

JIM
(genuinely)
Congratulations

He holds out his hand and NEVILLE takes THE PLAQUE and hands
over in return a glass of champagne JIM takes a small sip
and sets the glass aside

NEVILLE
I seen you around I think you like
to lose

JIM

Life’s a losing proposition right
Might as well get it over with

He starts off
NEVILLE
(over his shoulder)
You need a stake

JIM turns

JIM
You like staking losers

NEVILLE has no response

JIM (CONTD)
I know how you stake people

NEVILLE
Then you know everything

He sips his drink and loses interest

JIM moves away now broke(KOREANS watching him one KOREAN
aside talking to MISTER LEE) He goes to a SIDEBOARD loaded
with BUFFET FOOD and realizes he’s famished He loads a
plate loads it and carries it out onto the terrace

EXT TERRACE CONTINUOUS
AMY looks briefly out through the window at the oblivious
JIM concerned intrigued and then moves on with her TRAY OF

CANAPES

JIM puts the plate on the terrace rail and starts to wolf the
food As we come around
MISTER LEE materializes behind him

MISTER LEE
Your luck is no good these days

JIM brasses this out

JIM
Maybe

MISTER LEE is intrigued by this guy

MISTER LEE
You came in with ten thousand in
cash I dont know where you got
it

JIM
Oh I think we can be pretty sure
it was from gambling

MISTER LEE
Wherever you got it you didnt
give it to me

JIM
No I didn’t
MISTER LEE
Why not
JIM
This is a gambling establishment
MISTER LEE
You have a family A wife

Children

JIM shakes his head “no” (Though this is a lie and a truth
simultaneously) MISTER LEE looks as if this explains plenty
which it may well do (Though it doesn’t) JIM stares out
over the canyon comes to an abrupt brass-balled decision

JIM
Well that depends if you give me
ten thousand more in credit

MISTER LEE
You owe a lot of money

JIM
Everybody owes money all over the
place Have I never not paid you
MISTER LEE
Eventually a debt gets too big to
pay Thenno one is responsible

JIM grips the rail of the porch Down in the LOWER GARDEN
PROSTITUTES do business by the pool one or another going off
with a businessman into the dark A freshly unfolded aspect
of Hell All whispers into ears As JIM watches

MISTER LEE (CONTD)

Some people find impossibility to
pay a relief Their livesare out
of their hands

(closer as on Feisal in

Lawrence )
I think you may be one of those
people

JIM takes it on Maybe what Mister Lee said is what he’s
after — maybe it isn’t TWO BIG KOREANS (the key ones
intelligent muscle) are now with MISTER LEE
MISTER LEE (CONT’D)
But all thisis starting to be
over

JIM looks at him

MISTER LEE (CONT’D)
Get me my money

MISTER LEE walks away his MUSCLE following

JIM leans back with his elbows on the rail stretching his
back looking at the stars and then looks over and sees

JIMS POV

NEVILLE now on the terrace lying back in a deck chair
smoking a COHIBA his boys seated in shadow nearby

MOMENTS LATER

A shadow falls across NEVILLE He looks up We reverse to
see

JIM

JIM
Stake me fifty grand

A long look from NEVILLE

NEVILLE
At twenty points

JIM
At whatever points you like We had
a conversation about odds You
think I mind them

NEVILLE
(to associate)
Give him fifty grand
(to JIM)
Make sure my man has your ah
digits and so forth

A DESIGNER LEATHER BAG is dug into JIM takes CASH in ten-
grand bundles and goes over to the surprised MISTER LEE He
shows the money

JIM
You can take the whole fifty and
well settle up — but as we
discussed this is a gambling
establishment

MISTER LEE keeps his counsel then keeps forty hands it to a
BIG KOREAN and hands ten grand back to Jim with a grave nod
JIM pockets the ten

JIM walks past the smoking disinterested NEVILLE

NEVILLE
Bonne chance

JIM
I feel better about your hat But
not about you wearing it inside
NEVILLE looks after him His GUYS stand up
NEVILLE
Sit down

INT THE CAISSE AREA NIGHT

JIM trades the ten in cash for plaques then heads (AMY again
picking him up with her eyes) for the Blackjack table

JIM pushes all his markers in The whole ten grand
JIM

Do it No no Don’t look at Mister
Lee You look at me Do it

The DEALER deals

JIM gets a queen showing The Dealer has an ace showing Jim
checks his down card and sees a 3 He nods for a card and is
hit with an 8 for 21

DEALER
Twenty one

The DEALER turns over an 8 making 20 and Jim has won He
could cash out now and big but he leaves his winnings down
and says

JIM
Play the two

The DEALER gives JIM a 10 up and another card down deals
himself a king up JIM flips and sees another 10 for 20 The
dealer draws two cards — and busts Jim’s won again

JIM nods for the DEALER to start another hand The DEALER
looks at MISTER LEE

JIM (CONTD)
He doesn’t want you to look at him
Deal the cards

SPECTATORS crowd around NEVILLE is watching AMY comes
through the crowd and SHE is watching

The DEALER gives JIM a down card and an 8 He deals himself a
4 showing over his down card JIM sees his down card is a 4

JIM (CONTD)
(to DEALER)
You take it

The DEALER turns over a 2 then draws a jack for 16 and then
a queen to bust Jim wins with a 10 for 14

MISTER LEE watches The DEALER looks at MISTER LEE

JIM (CONTD)
Don’t look at him There’s no
limit

DEALER
It’s for your own protection

JIM
Fuck my protection You don’t come
here for fucking protection from
yourself

(MORE)

JIM (CONTD)
You come here for the fuckin’
opposite and here I am Deal the
cards

MISTER LEE nods

THE CARDS ARE DEALT

JIM wins another hand with 21 He takes up the counters
Turns away goes with people watching him Amy watching him
to

The roulette table

JIM stands and looks at the waiting table magic in the light
over it He puts down his plaques NEVILLE has come up beside

him

JIM (CONTD)
Everything on black

NEVILLE
Red’s been coming up all night

JIM
You want me to pay you now Is that
what you want me to do

NEVILLE
No

JIM
Why not

NEVILLE

Because you’ll either lose and
youre mine for talking shit about
my headgear or either I want to
just watch the show

JIM

It’s all of those things
NEVILLE

Yeah
JIM

What about ripping me off outside
if I win

NEVILLE
Not in that business brother

JIM
Everything on black

The ball rolls and it’s nearly black but then the ball
lands in

RED

The CROWD reacts as if a man has just dropped from a
scaffold AMY in the crowd turns away JIM leans with his
elbows on the table for a minute but then stands straight to
look NEVILLE in the eye NEVILLE looks at JIM

JIM (CONTD)
Float me some spending money

NEVILLE gives him a thousand dollars

NEVILLE
That’s at twenty points too

JIM folds away the money He looks at NEVILLE He looks at
MISTER LEE Then he goes pushing his way through the crowd
as those people look after him who still have the interest to
do so

EXT STREET IN THE HOLLYWOOD HILLS DAWN

JIM comes down the steps looks bleakly at the valets and
then walks up to his car The sun is rising lighting the
shoulder of the hill beyond the Hollywood sign

INT CAR DAWN

JIM sits in his car exhausted defeated taking shit on
barely holding it together He watches NEVILLE and his POSSE
pile into two Bentleys and drive off down the canyon Then he
puts the car in gear and drives

EXT SUNSET BOULEVARD NIGHT

JIM pulls up to the Seventh Veil and in one long shot gets
out of the car and heads in handing the doorman a 20 moving
through the dark room avoiding the “dancers” (it’s been a
long time since strip clubs in Los Angeles haven’t been
brothels) until he comes to one in particular a beautiful
black Amazon in a yellow bikini She starts to do the thing
the come-on (stripper ad-libs)

STRIPPER
You a tourist baby

But Jim holds up his hand and stops her

JIM
Were all tourists Its the nature
of the planet

She starts to speak

JIM (CONTD)
Listen I don’t need you to talk I
need you to listen to me No No
no you listen I know it’s hard I
know you want to talk your
bullshit but if you do I’m going
to leave

She nods maybe getting it He holds out a hundred dollar
bill She looks at it starts to speak but he stops her

JIM (CONTD)
I don’t want you to act like you’re
in a porn film made for retards
because there’s no girl in here
better looking than anybody I’ve
ever even gone out with once so I
want you to act like a normal woman
with no mental problems and then I
want you to take this hundred
dollars I want you to take me in
back where you blow people for
money and I want you to do what I
ask you to do without saying
another fucking word to me ever
again in my life Can you do that
Because if you can’t shut up I
can’t stay here

Finally she nods and takes the hundred dollar bill

JIM (CONTD)
OK All right

He follows her into the back room as if marching to a death
sentence and we go to

BLACK

EXT UCLA DAY

Establish a part of the college with JIM’S CAR parked
erratically in the foreground STUDENTS and STAFF on the
grounds of the campus like figures in a painting

INT ENGLISH DEPT FACULTY MEN’S ROOM DAY

JIM is splashing his face with water He’s still not shaved
His white collar is now not clean Out of one of the toilets
comes an English Department ASSHOLE (JONES) Basically FDR
without the wheelchair senior to Jim and not as good on any
subject He washes his hands

JONES
First time Ive ever seen you
without a shave

JIM
I’m trying to avoid tenure You can
have that one

JONES
If I could teach like you Id be a
little more grateful

JIM examines him

JIM
Fuck you Fuck grateful

JONES goes JIM continues to wash

INT UCLA CLASSROOM DAY

We only use one classroom for Jim It’s a big one This one
only half full is still a good crowd mixed evenly along
racial and gender lines Hes a popular professor Among the
students is (and this explains everything)

AMY watching him eyes tired from her night job her laptop
open

And another is DEXTER a white blonde stoner UCLA tennis
player a good one

Way way way at the back a ballplayer named LAMAR is
checking his cellphone while his academic advisor is
whispering to him fiercely

JIM is writing on the board “A Groats-worth of Wit Bought
with a Million of Repentance” then turning

JIM
The first public notice that was
ever made of Shakespeare was from a
grub street writer Robert Greene
who called him an “upstart crow
beautified with our feathers”
(MORE)

JIM (CONTD)
In the book under that title on the
board If you haven’t discovered
Robert Greene on your own at this
point the man who wrote the novel
Pandosto you don’t belong in this
class

ON AMYS SCREEN is the famous picture of the ghost of ROBERT
GREENE in his winding sheet pen to paper at a table
condemned to hackdom even in the afterlife She clicks and
hides the picture

NEBBISH
(who has no idea who
Robert Greene is)
Is the stolen feathers thing
because Greene knew Shakespeare was
the Earl of Oxford

JIM puts his head on the blackboard Not again

JIM
Listen The Earl of Oxford
published poetry It wasn’t any
good Had Oxford been able to get a
play put on he would have broken a
leg to do it Can you think of any
human being that would for any
reason not put his name on
“Hamlet”

BLANK faces look at him

JIM (CONTD)
The Oxfordian thing the anti-
Strafordian thingwhat pisses
people off about Shakespeare
What lies behind every controversy
about Shakespeareis rage Rage
over the nature and unequal
distribution of talent Rage that
genius appears where it appears for
no material reason at all Desiring
a thing

He passes AMY walking

JIM (CONTD)
cannot make you have it

He drifts through the room talking

JIM (CONTD)
The trouble with writing if I may
bring it up here in the English
Departmentinstead of allowing
you all to talk about sexual
politics all fucking day longis
that we all do a little of it from
time to time writing and some of
us start to think delusionally
that well maybe with a little
time a little peace a little
money in the bank maybe if we left
the old lady and the kids maybe if
we had that room of our own we
might be writers too Why do we
think that We accept genius in
sports in painting as something
we cannot do but it’s no more
likely that you can be a writer
than you can be an Olympic fucking
pole vaulter Because what you have
to be before you try to be a pole
vaulter is a pole vaulter

STUDENT
You are one

JIM
A pole vaulter

STUDENT
A novelist

JIM

No I’m not For me to be a novelist
Id have to make a deal with myself
that it was ok being a mediocrity
in a profession that died
commercially in the last century
People do that I’m not one of
them If you take away nothing else
from my class from this
experience let it be this If
you’re not a genius don’t bother
The world needs plenty of
electricians and a lot of them are
happy I’ll be fucked if I’ll be a
midlist novelist getting good
reviews from the people I give good
reviews to

STUDENT (0S)
You’re better than—
JIM

Im not better than anybody but the
people who suck

(turns points not going

to listen to this)
Lets talk about talent Let’s have
a look at Dexter right there
Dexter an ordinary-looking young
man with a size forty jacket
regular features and decent
dentition is the second-ranked
collegiate tennis player in the
United States

He leans in on Dexter

JIM (CONTD)
Howd that come about Dexter You
come from a tennis family

DEXTER
I started five years ago in high
school because the tennis guys had
the best weed

JIM
So you started playing tennis
because the tennis guys had the
best weed After you started
tennis how long was it before you
and everybody else realized you
were better than everybody

DEXTER is well brought up and doesn’t want to answer

JIM (CONTD)
Not very long It was immediately
right Everybody knew you were
better

DEXTER nods

JIM (CONTD)
What happened when you noticed you
were naturally better than
everybody Everybody else is
lumbering around essentially
pretending to play tennis while
you played tennis like Jesus
raising the dead

DEXTER
I got interested in tennis

JIM

Well were all different My own
personal view of Jesus is that he’d
lose interest in being Jesus as
soon as he realized that he was —
and that it was easy You
knowhow many lepers can you do
without getting tired Lazarus and
water into wine are good as one-
offs I personally think that the
thing to do is to one thing
definitively and then move onto
something elseif and only if

(and he is referring to

himself)
--you can figure out what it is
that needs doing But let’s deal
with you Do you remember
Machiavelli That would have been
in September

DEXTER
I can remember September

JIM
Is it the game brother or the
money Virtu or fama Fame or
virtue Youre kicking ass in
tennis What are you after Don’t
go modest on me What do you want
Money or glory

DEXTER doesn’t know what to answer

DEXTER
Both

JIM
You got ambitious yeah

AMY is watching
DEXTER
I realizedas I learned about the
game and about myself in the game
that I was in reach of the

He doesn’t want to say it JIM leans in and whispers

JIM
Highest possible level
DEXTER
The highest level Maybe Yeah
That

JIM
OK so youre headed for the
highest level But its not all
roses It’s still a gamble isn’t
it Things about it burn your ass

DEXTER takes that on Nods

JIM (CONTD)
People out there writing articles
about less good tennis players You
know why that is Dexter They have
publicists Ive personally seen an
article that put a fake question
mark over your ability

DEXTER smolders

JIM (CONTD)
Also I read somewhere that your old
high school coach got a job in
England claiming to have discovered
and created you

DEXTER looks ready to explode thinking of that one

JIM (CONTD)
Dexters old coach now coaches the
UK international team because
Dexter was good at tennis
He used Dexter and fucked him If
Dexter broke his leg in five places
and never played again this guy
this fucking liar this expatriate
excrescence that came out of an
alcohol coma and Pomona High School
because Dexter picked up a racket
because the tennis guys had the
best weed is probably going to end
up knighted for services to British
sport There are two rules first
be a genius Second don’t get
fucked You got that on board
Dexter yeah

DEXTER nods

JIM (CONTD)
I’m a literature teacher I can’t
write well enough to bother
(MORE)

JIM (CONTD)
Or I just don’t bother Whichever
Whichever it is there’1l be no
apotheosis around here therell be
no ambition here I put my money
down anywhere else Because if I
cant be king I wont be anybody
What did the Emperor Vespasian say
on his deathbed

AMYs hand writes Vae puto deus fio on her notebook and
then conceals it

JIM (CONTD)
He said Dear me I think I am
becoming a God If I cant die
knowing that Ill be remembered I
wont try to be remembered One
novel and out If you want to learn
creative writing you can go down
the hall and find seven people who
want to do it and cant

STUDENT (0S)
You can

JIM
But I wont Because Im not good
enough But do you know who does
write at the highest level When
most of us and even I write
barely adequately Do you know who
it is in this room

The NEBBISH gets ready for coronation JIM leans in on him
and whispers

JIM (CONTD)
No it isn’t the one who talks the
mostand you really do talk shit
You don’t know anything at all
You’re an NPR host Tops

The NEBBISH freaks
Jim indicates AMY

JIM (CONTD)
The literary person here is Ms
Phillips She is the least
obstreperous in this room the
quietest and the only one in this
room who can have a real career in
letters Some of you can have one
perceptually

(MORE )

JIM (CONTD)
Only she can have one in reality
She’s better at writing than our US
presently amateur number two is at
tennis Lets address the
Shakespeare question Where do you
come from Ms Phillips

She is blushing furiously Almost soundlessly

AMY
Ohio

JIM
Parents geniuses by any chance
Filthy rich

She shakes her head He rounds on her like a prosecutor
brutal blunt

JIM (CONTD)
Your Dad wasn’t the Earl of Oxford
was he

AMY

JIM
How old were you when you read

Almost inaudibly

Amy
I was three

JIM
That’s early That’s prodigious
Any advantages Literary home life

She shakes her head but is now holding his stare boldly

JIM (CONTD)
What was your father

AMY
He worked in a factory

JIM
Your mother

AMY shakes her head No mother or don’t bring it up

JIM (CONTD)
What was your mother
AMY finally looks up

AMY
She was an alcoholic She was
insane

JIM turns to the NEBBISH

JIM
Isn’t your Dad

NEBBISH
I don’t see how this is pertinent

JIM

(back on an uncomfortable

Amy )
No money no advantages not a peer
of the realm You’re not the Earl
of fucking Oxford are you No Then
why the fuck are you better than
the rest of us

She looks away

JIM (CONTD)
No you look at me

She does

JIM (CONTD)
You are better than the rest of us
If no one’s told you yet that
youre a genius and an artist let
me be the first

She starts to cry

WHITE DUDE IN BACK
I don’t know if you can say that
because I think it is subjective
man I mean we all have something
to offer

JIM goes very close to him and into his very ear says

JIM
Bullshit

He walks on

JIM (CONTD)
Genius is magical not material If
you don’t have the magic no amount
of wishing will make it so
The period ends
AMY in tears is gathering her stuff

To DEXTER as he slaps him on the shoulder

JIM (CONTD)
See you at the house Shakespeare

AMY rushes from the room

INT HALLWAY MOMENTS LATER

JIM is moving along noticing AMY who has leaned against
wall to compose herself She looks up at JIM JIM knows
exactly what hes done some good and hes not sure why AMY
tears off down the hall JIM puts his head down and

continues DEAN FULLER falls in step beside him

DEAN FULLER
May I have a word

JIM
More words Ive about had it with
them I dont care about words or
anything else

DEAN FULLER
Thats ridiculous Jim the
athletic department—

JIM
Yes

DEAN FULLER
Has asked how a certain person is
doing

CUT TO

a

He indicates the ballplayer from the classroom — a very tall

African American youth with a baby face who is sitting

outside an advisors office (on the floor so that his height
is not absurd) talking worriedly on a cellphone Its LAMAR

HAMPTON
JIM looks

JIM
OK How is a certain person
doing The certain person cannot
write at collegiate level Then
again who gives a fuck Half the
tenured faculty would be flogged to
death for idiocy at any grammar
school in any previous century

DEAN FULLER
Why do you care about that if you
dont care about anything

JIM
I probably dont care If you want
to give a dyslexic an English
degree its up to you

DEAN FULLER
Its time to get serious about your
career

JIM
When it is Ill let you know
Unless of course you let me know
that its time to not get serious
and I dont care either way

DEAN FULLER
Youre a born teacher

at him

JIM
I was born a lot of things It
doesnt mean I want to be any of
them
(knowing the answer)
What they got a particularly big
game coming up

DEAN FULLER looks desperate and implicated

DEAN FULLER
I imagine youd know more than
anyone

JIM
(leaning close)
You dont know anything about me
But hey Ill throw him out of
class right now He can be in
academic arbitration and unable to
play Wheres your money go then

DEAN FULLER is the real gambler

JIM (CONTD)
Oh Im sorry its already down
Ill keep him in class Why dont
you give me a call and tell me
about Villanova Quid pro quo

JIM moves on and LAMAR on the phone watches him pass with
interest but continues his call

EXT ROBERTA’S HOUSE IN BEL AIR DAY

JIM in his car waits for the GATES to open and then spins in
under the canopy of trees It’s one of the more East Coast
houses in Bel Air Let it breath Jim stops his car sits for
a moment then gets out squinting in the California light
He notices that

THE FRONT DOOR has been opened by a waiting BUTLER He walks
over to the front door

BUTLER
Good morning Mister James
JIM
Call me Jim How’s the weekend
BUTLER
Crap sir
JIM

How’d you do on the football

BUTLER
Not so good

JIM
It’s going around brother

He passes through into the shadowed familiar interior

CUT TO

EXT THE CLAY TENNIS COURT DAY

Like the one at Evans’ house Jim’s mother ROBERTA is playing
with DEXTER who is her coach JIM is sitting in the high
referees chair a hat down over his eyes smoking a cigarette
and watching the play

DEXTER
Good good That’s great

ROBERTA is a good older player But can’t make the last lob
from Dexter She goes to the net to shake Dexter’s hand

ROBERTA
I’1l never beat you Mister Dexter
but if you ever give me a point
again Ill fire you

DEXTER barely sweating grins and gets it

ROBERTA (CONTD)
Good luck in the finals

DEXTER
Thank you maam

DEXTER goes to his gear which is not on the “hospitality”

side of the court Hes an employee and Roberta is Roberta
ROBERTA goes to the table at the side near Jim’s chair and
pours herself some ice water from a lemoned pitcher

ROBERTA
So Why do you need fifty thousand
dollars

JIM looks away not answering

ROBERTA (CONTD)
I already sent off a sum of money
to your wife who hasn’t seen you
for two months

JIM
She doesn’t want to see me

He comes down from the chair He gets some iced water

JIM (CONTD)
Marriage is something they do on
another planet Mom You know that
as well as I do right

She looks at him sharply then lets it go She wets her face
with a napkin dipped in ice water

ROBERTA
Ive never claimed to like her but
she needs to effect a legal
separation if you’re going to go
on as you are

JIM
Going on as I am is the only thing
I’ve got

ROBERTA

Thats sophistical and beneath you
which you know as well as I do I
think you would agree that
modifications in your behavior are
possible

JIM
Something being possible doesnt
make it mandatory

ROBERTA
I know you’re in some sort
ofstate I even might know it’s
quasi-suicidal I imagine it’s
connected to what happened to your
book You’re not narcissistic
enough to be putting on a show
You’re not an adolescent youre
not sick in any way and we don’t
even need to say that you’re far
from stupid You’re my son but you
need to understand very clearly
that I’ve said goodbye before to
people that I love

JIM
Yeah whatever did happen to Dad

INTERCUT

YOUNG JIM holding his breath beneath the water of a pool
Above him at the edge of the pool through the dancing water
we see a couple (his parents Roberta and whoever Dad was)
fighting

She turns on him coldly

ROBERTA
I’ve said goodbye to people many
many times And so has every person
on earth who lives an orderly and
sanitary life

JIM
I said goodbye to my wife only
because I couldnt depend on her to
say it to me

ROBERTA

I don’t want to understand the
nature of your problem I just want
you not to have it

(a beat)
Do you know why you’re looking at
me like that Because I just said
what you would say to someone else

He cops to it

ROBERTA (CONTD)
Any money from me from now on goes
directly to your wife If I hear
that you have ever touched a dime
of it there won’t be any more
Even for them And if you don’t
stop gambling I’1ll cut them off
Dont come here for money ever
again

JIM
Thank you

He walks away across the court She turns away to get more
water DEXTER has packed up They walk together towards the
house

JIM (CONTD)
Sorry to use you in show and tell
today You’re headed for the
finals right

DEXTER
Sure the fuck am

JIM
Were all in the finals It’s the
end of days brother It’s the
apocalypse

His mobile rings Whatever number is on it he doesn’t
answer

EXT ROBERTAS HOUSE DAY

JIM drives out of the gates and he notices a car containing
BIG ERNIE — a pretty big enforcer dude but not that big He
gets out of his own car locks it street-parked and walks
over to BIG ERNIE

JIM
You looking at my mothers house
for some particular reason

BIG ERNIE
Yeah Im wondering if she gave you
any money in it

JIM
Nope

BIG ERNIE
Im from Frank Lets take a ride

JIM gets in and we

CUT TO

INT EXT BIG ERNIES CARSANTA MONICA BOULEVARD DAY
They are just driving along BIG ERNIE saying nothing
JIM
I dont owe Frank that much pal
and it isnt due Not even the vig
BIG ERNIE
Did you or did you not call and ask
him for more money

JIM looks over at him

JIM
Yeah I did

BIG ERNIE
Well were gonna go see him about
that We got one stop
BIG ERNIE wheels into a crappy motel

CUT TO

EXT MOTEL DAY

JIM trails BIG ERNIE along a line of motel doors BIG ERNIE
comes to a door adjusts his jacket and knocks hard Its a
knock you never want to hear

JIM
Do you practice that

BIG ERNIE
Not really but I got a junkie
girlfriend and its how I wake her
up in the bathroom

The DOOR is opened on its chain and we have a moment to see
the smeared unshaven face of a DEBTOR before BIG ERNIE kicks
the door in breaking THE DEBTORS cheek in the process

INT MOTEL ROOM CONTINUOUS

LIGHT blasts into the dark long-term residence as THE
DEBTOR in wife-beater and underwear reels back from the
door holding his face In an instant BIG ERNIE is on to him
beating the living shit out of him on the bed JIM watches A
regular sequence of right hands straight into the face
smashing spectacles nose mouth THE DEBTORs face is a
ruined mask of blood within seconds BIG ERNIE drags the guy
onto the floor and brings a boot down on a delicate hand He
straightens up reviews his work JIM has noticed CARTOONS
silently on TV TOYS in the corner of the room He then sees
A BOY peeping out of the bathroom door staring at the ruin
of his father

BIG ERNIE

(to JIM)
Well thats too bad but the
memories may mitigate against some
pretty shitty genetics

(idly handing the

dumbstruck BOY a 100

bill on the way out)
Feel like a schvitz

INT SCHVITZ DAY

FRANK who is basically Sinatra but bald and Jewish sits in
the steam slowly shaving his head as JIM and BIG ERNIE
enter and sit down — JIM less readily than BIG ERNIE who
takes a covering position JIM sits beside Frank after Frank
slaps the tiles

FRANK
You have a good time with Big
Ernie

JIM

He’s not that big

FRANK
They’re not talking about his
jacket brother
JIM
With all due respect I’m not
interested in his johnson

FRANK
Are you saying I am

JIM
No

FRANK
I admit that in this milieu we live
in this demi-monde there is a
little locker room humor to be
expected Locker room anything
always turns out to be
fundamentally in essence
homosexual I mean lets be frank

BIG ERNIE
It has been so since the Greeks

JIM
I can’t argue with that You know
your stuff

FRANK

They used to grease up and have at
each other You don’t bet on the
football do you

JIM
Football’s for homosexuals

FRANK
A friend of mine says that you’re a
teacher

JIM
I’m an associate professor at UCLA

FRANK
My daughter’s at The New School
Linguistics Hey she’s not the
Barbra Streisand Professor of
Gender Studies but it’s a job We
all got jobs Mines supposedly
television production Listen

JIM
I’m listening

FRANK
The amount of cash you want is more
than I am ordinarily disposed to
loan out unless say you’re a
medium-sized country with the
ability to raise taxes under the
threat of military force

JIM smiles

JIM nods

FRANK (CONTD)
OR a Eurotrash cokehead who has a
father who can be squeezed after
the kid’s microbudget sci-fi film
doesn’t get picked up at Sundance
Are you following me

takes it

FRANK (CONT’D)
You got family that can be
squeezed I’m saying that
rhetorically

JIM
Let’s deal with this as gentlemen
who understand each other

FRANK
No I need us to treat each other
like we’re not gentlemen and that
were very very stupid

JIM
There’s no family There’s never
any family

FRANK accepts that

FRANK
What do you make a hundred
hundred fifty a year Two hundred
before taxes

JIM shrugs

FRANK (CONTD)
What’s wrong with you You have
brain damage some fundamental
disability Two hundred is a monk

JIM spreads his hands

JIM nods

FRANK (CONTD)
And you a monk owe that Korean
son of a bitch the prince of
fucking darkness that much right
now and then another fifty
excluding the vig to Neville
Baraka Who will kill you because
when you cut cards he got the king
of spades and you laughed at him

JIM
Youre pretty well-informed

FRANK
You borrowed 50K from a very
dangerous man after he was already
going to kill you

JIM
Yeah I did

FRANK
Birth education intelligence
talent looks family money has
all this been a real comprehensive
fucking burden for you I see two
problems One the world at his
feet in this town and he’s a
fuckin’ monk Because apparently
fuck it Two he wants to die for
some unspecified personal reason
and therefore owes money to Korean
murderers and talks about a
schwarzer’s hat in a place where
you can get killed and they merely
drop your body up the Angeles
Crest Three he wants to borrow a
quarter of a million dollars to pay
off debts which he will not in
fact pay off because to go back
to point two he’s suicidal

JIM
Just let me know what you can do
for me all right

FRANK
If I help you consolidate these
debts so you dont fuck the Korean
or the schwarzer up the ass do you
think that I will be anybody you
want to fuck up the ass Am I
likelier to be fucked up the ass

JIM
Less likely I imagine

FRANK

Listen to me listen to me I’m not
your doctor I’m not your cognitive
therapist but let me be your
uncle You have to pay ten percent

a week—
JIM
I know what I have to do
FRANK
Well where are you going to get my
money
JIM

Ill get your money

FRANK
How much you want

JIM
Im three hundred and twenty five
thousand all in disregarding that
Im five months behind on my
mortgage

FRANK
When’s the last time you ever had
money in your hand to pay a debt
and paid it

JIM starts to speak FRANK raises his hand

FRANK (CONTD)
Don’t fuck with me This will be
your first time when you pay Am I
right

JIM
You’re right

FRANK
We’re not done I need something
from you

JIM

Collateralwhat

FRANK
No I need you to say to me “I need
this money because I’m a scumbag
gambler” “I’m a scumbag gambler
who takes food out of the mouths of
my wife and child That’s the kind
of man I am Frank and I want you
to loan me a dying suicidal
asshole a lot of money”

JIM
That’s too much to remember to
repeat it

FRANK
Lets make it simpler I know youre
not a gambler Youre doing
something more complicated that
manifests itself as gambling but I
dont have any other frame of
reference Ive got money you want
it If you want the money you tell
me “I am not a man”

JIM sits He doesn’t respond

FRANK (CONTD)
Say it Say “I am not a man”

We dont know whether Jim is going to say it or not and we

in the chair That he is in love with her is painfully
obvious That she is in love with him is apparent It’s one
of those times when you know you could cross the room He
smiles and then doesn’t He looks at the ceiling Another
moment

JIM

me having talent

JIM
I said what I said Is there
something you don’t get about “A

JIM
That’s what they thought

NEVILLE
I hear you went to Little Frank for
money and that he wouldn’t loan it
to you

JIM
Well you heard wrong because he did
try to loan it to me and I didn’t
take it

NEVILLE
You didn’t like the terms

And this as we come around on Jim is Jim’s shred of hope in
himself however casually he says it

JIM
No the terms were unacceptable

NEVILLE
But you’re into me I ain’t Fannie
Mae Ain’t no bailouts

JIM
Why did you loan me the money

NEVILLE
A gamble between two players who
like to play You and me Stakes

EXT A MARINA DAY

A mahogany yacht from the 1930s is swarming with its
uniformed crew On the rear deck an old man in a wheelchair
sits like a lizard in the sun It is Jim’s grandfather ED
Ed is not only on an IV for hydration a bag attached to the
wheelchair receives an occasional trickle of money-colored
BILE JIM is looking a sudden increase in the bile

ED

(a broad swamp Yankee

accent)
I drink a ginger ale it comes
right out Look at that But I
still like the taste of it I like
it here too I ain’t going
anywhere until they come and get
me I used to take this boat to
French Polynesia Other places
Everywhere They say theyll do my
ashes

Throwing gestures at the water

ED (CONTD)
So I can travel But I dont buy
it I have a daughter Shell get
me in a box no matter what I write
down

JIM
Do you know who I am

ED
Yeah

A long beat

ED (CONTD)
Youre my Jim

JIM has to put his sunglasses on
INTERCUT

A YOUNGER JIM than the boy in the pool sitting on a YOUNGER
EDS lap and driving a big vintage Bentley car round and
round the driveway at what is now Robertas house

JIM surfaces as ED grabs his steward by the white-coated arm

ED (CONTD)
This is my grandson Jim

STEWARD
(disapproving)
I have met your grandson many
times

JIM
(to STEWARD)
He said I could use the boat
brother If you’re not careful I’1l
use it again and bring more
Mexicans

The STEWARD who is Mexican grimaces politely and fucks off

JIM (CONTD)
He doesn’t like Mexicans and hes
a Mexican I can’t figure it out

ED
Takes all kinds Writing anything

JIM
That’s all done

ED
Well I won’t waste time calling it

With youthe best thing I can
give you is zero Jim

JIM

JIM stares through his sunglasses

ED
I told your mother the other day
that I’d just been playing cards
with my sister on a porch in
Connecticut in a lightning storm
Your mother convinced me otherwise
She told me my sister is dead

JIM
She would

ED
How do you be a writer when your
mother is a writer is what I want
to know

JIM
You don’t The situation is very
nearly Greek

ED
Anybody ever wrote about you it
would be half about her No wonder
you said fuck it

JIM looks at the old man with great appreciation

ED (CONTD)
However you come into this from
nothing You go back into nothing
from this So in between you have
to do what you have to do Its the
only time you got to do it Wanted
to write down what I remember Too
late Cant do it now Why I
married your grandmother

JIM
Tell me what you remember

ED thinks

ED
She said “Edward unless you stop
dissipating yourself and get your
elephants to Croydon I am marrying
Frederick Sitwell Three” Well I
couldn’t stand the thought of that
I wasn’t going to let Fred Sitwell
to get anything How many of us
succeed not because we want what we
get but because we can’t be seen to
lose You sit there right now
because I hated Fred Sitwell Male
behavior Is what it is Ladies
different Long study of subject
Been at it a hundred years now
First man to build a bridge know
what his wife said to him

JIM shakes his head smiling

ED (CONTD)
“What are you too lazy to row”

JIM laughs

ED (CONTD)
So because I was a jackass who had
to defeat another jackass in combat
there I was married almost seventy
years to a woman who by and large
only gave me a hard time Got my
elephants to Croydon though
Computers then were cards Holes in
cards Never understood it Said I
did Invested in it

JIM
Did you ever gamble

No Gambling is synthetic

senile as he may have seemed

office Jim Even on the boat

THE STEWARD is glaring from the companionway

JIM
Safe is easy You keep at it For

EXT JIMS PORCH DAY

ROBERTA comes up from her car up the walk and knocks on the
door No answer She finds it unlocked and goes in

INT JIMS HOUSE BATHROOM DAY

JIM spoons cereal and milk watching The game He looks up
to see ROBERTA dressed to the nines looking at him
ROBERTA reaches out a foot in Manolo Blahnik and pushes the
TV off the chair — there is an explosion of cathode tube off
— and then sits down on the chair

ROBERTA
You always said you lost interest
in sports after you stopped playing
them

JIM
I did

ROBERTA leaves the room and JIM after sitting for a moment

begins to get out of the bath His feet avoid the broken
glass and he whips the TV plug out of the wall

INT JIMS LIVING ROOM DAY
ROBERTA is sitting agitatedly in a chair JIM comes in in
his bathrobe and immediately switches on the same game on

the wall unit

ROBERTA
You have money on this game

JIM doesn’t answer He looks back at the screen LAMAR sinks
a three-pointer

JIM
He’s in my class

ROBERTA
Is he good at English

JIM thinks weighs it and then says

JIM

ROBERTA
Do you really want to be a man who
goes to his mother to cover
gambling debts

JIM thinks about it Hes in if he plays it right

ROBERTA (CONTD)
That you don’t want to live with
your wife I accept You never
should have married her Why did
you

JIM
Because the odds weren’t good

ROBERTA
How bad is the trouble you’re in

JIM
I’m always in trouble

ROBERTA
I mean do you still need the
money

JIM
No

ROBERTA
I don’t know when to believe you
anymore
(a beat)
Perhaps I should believe the
gangster that called my house

JIM after a complex look at his mother reaches for a pad of
paper and writes on it and folds it and hands it to her

ROBERTA (CONTD)
What’s this

JIM
What I owe

She opens it and reads

ROBERTA
(trembling with rage
getting up)

How is that possible

JIM
It was the same as marriage I
gambled I lost

ROBERTA
Marriage is in the real world It’s
not a game of chance

JIM
Now youre talking crazy

He eats cereal again

ROBERTA
What will they do to you if you
don’t pay

JIM looks at her

JIM
Break every bone in my body Or go
after the family

ROBERTA whacks him across the face JIM takes it

ROBERTA
This isnt something you cant
help Youre doing it on purpose

JIM
There’s going to be a time when I
want something again When I won’t
allow myself to be seen in this
condition But it isn’t now and it
isn’t up to you or anything you or
anybody says

She sits holding the paper Then

ROBERTA
Are you degraded enough to go to
the bank with your mother

INT A BANK CUBICLE DAY

JIM and ROBERTA are seated Jim’s dignity is somewhat covered
by sunglasses as he sits beside his mother

ROBERTA
I wish to withdraw three hundred
and twenty-five thousand dollars in
cash

THE BANKER looks up

ROBERTA (CONTD)
I wish to withdraw three hundred
and twenty-five thousand dollars in
cash

THE BANKER looks from ROBERTA to JIM and back to ROBERTA

BANKER
In cases like thisI have to ask
if everything is all right

ROBERTA
Nothing’s “all right” when someone
needs that sort of money in cash
but it’s my money and it’s none of
your business

BANKER
(to JIM)
Are you a relation

ROBERTA
This is my son

THE BANKER takes this on
JIM

Are you implying she’s under duress
or something

BANKER
(not to be fucked with)
Should I
ROBERTA

The money’s mine there’s plenty of
it and please don’t tell me even
once that your bullshit is for my
own protection That is understood
You have a withdrawal slip you
have my ID I have sufficient
funds my family has been with this
bank since my father started it and
I need three hundred and twenty-
five thousand dollars in cash

THE BANKER goes onto her computer
BANKER

Youre absolutely sure you want it
in cash

ROBERTA

BANKER

officer

ROBERTA

(face burning)
Do what you have to do

EXT BANK DUSK

ROBERTA shaking with rage holds the big yellow envelope of
money

ROBERTA
This is the last of it forever

JIM is looking around at the city as if hes not really
there

ROBERTA (CONTD)
If I ever have to feel the effect
of your problems again be they
made up or real or pay the
consequences of your foolishness I
will never see you again Do you
understand that

JIM nods

ROBERTA (CONTD)

(shouting)
I need you to reallyfucking
understand that And I need you to
feel like something not even human
when you take this envelope Am I
just a barking dog in a silent
film What the fuck am I to you

JIM looks at her

ROBERTA (CONTD)
Do you even give a damn or do you
just want to take the money Do you
want to just take the money and go
Even if I say goodbye to you and
consider it cheap to be rid of you

JIM
I want to take the money and go

She drops the envelope on the ground JIM picks up the
envelope ROBERTA puts her face in her hands Then tough old
bird she recovers herself and races off towards her LIVERY
CAR

WE now are watching this departure JIM holding the money
and Roberta pulling away in the back seat of her town car
from the POV of a car down the street AS JIM begins to walk
the car is put into gear and begins to move slowly

INT A CAB NIGHT

JIM the yellow envelope on his lap is driving through
Koreatown He passes a dubious doorway of a building
containing a Korean grocery that is not really a grocery (the
first layer of deceptive businesses that conceal the gambling
establishment) There are black cars parked in front of it a
knot of KOREAN HEAVIES smoking cigarettes on the sidewalk
JIM is agitated He’s struggling and losing There is a
reason he doesnt want to pay

JIM
(talking to himself more
than the driver)
No no no I don’t want to go here
anymore

DRIVER
This is what you said

KOREAN HEAVIES who we recognize have recognized JIM in the
back of the erratic cab

JIM
Its not time yet Its not time
Drive I told you to fuckin drive

He sits back

He looks at the yellow envelope on the seat beside him Then
forward

INT GARAGE AND HOUSE DAY VARIOUS

JIM holding his envelope notes that the car is gone He
looks at the STROLLER in the corner BEACH BAG other objects
recognizable from previous life

He uses a key on the interior door and after getting in
disarms the ADT alarm He looks around the kitchen the high
chair at the table the washed-up bottles by the sink He
sits down at the table and with a finger turns around the
baby’s placemat it is a brightly colored map of the world
He turns it back to where it was

He goes and looks at the things stuck to the refrigerator
baby pictures but nothing of Jim He clutches the ENVELOPE
full of money

He continues through the house He regards the LIVING ROOM
He opens a door into what used to be his STUDY and sees that
the shelves are empty and the BOOKS are half put into cartons
and half stacked on the floor by the door

There is no desk merely four indents in the carpet where the
desk legs used to be

He takes that on he moves along to look into the bedroom A
crib with a mobile the baby’s things He goes along and
looks into the other bedroom and when he switches on the
light stands there with head cocked looking at

JIMS POV

A man’s boots a rumpled bed two water bottles and a wine
glass on the night stand He goes into the bathroom and sees
a leather bag of shaving tackle Not his He sorts through
the toilet kit and finds condoms and oddly Rogaine
packets

He leans against the wall and stays there head back eyes
closed holding his crinkling envelope of money

From OFF we hear two car doors slam close JIM pushes off the
wall and heads slowly back towards the kitchen

symbolically for himself Noticing
that that lack of a sixth shot
which no one else ever had is why
I’m here now

(MORE )
JIM (CONTD)
Along with the being really fucking
good at English thing

journalism and I was sent by a
magazine The New Yorker as a
matter of fact to interview a
famous writer I put the recorder
on the table I got my pad and pen
out and the great man came in and
do you know what I did I got up
and left and I went home and
finished a novel instead Sort of a
Frank Sitwell situation

raised

STUDENT

JIM
A major figure in American realism
You know we really should have
gone for American realism I mean
lets have more fuckin’ realism I
mean shouldn’t I be teaching you
things I know all you’re here for
is a sufficiency of English
credits but Jesus if I’m here I
ought to be doing better I ought
to be doing better but I can’t be
fucked Just write down that he
saves the sixth shot symbolically
for himself and you won’t find it
referenced anywhere because I’m the
only one who thought of it It’s in
a monograph somewhere that got me
into this situation

LAMAR watches is the teacher cracking up But then he gets a
text and looks at it

JIM (CONTD)
Lamar we talked about the cell

JIM

person Talk about how Lamar
Hampton is at ease with his
celebrity

JIM smiles

LAMAR (CONTD)
You think I’m stupid

As he passes JONES who is tightening his laces

JONES

JIM
I don’t want to be me he doesn’t
want to be him but you want to be

some serious consideration

JONES stares after him for a minute then loses interest and
continues tying his shoes

EXT UCLA CAMPUS DAY

JIM is walking towards the road and comes to a BUS STOP

Wind deviled dust

JIM wakes in the shadow of a boulder lying on a blanket He
sits up

Amy is nowhere to be seen
JIM grabs water and walks a little way out into the desert

Giant rock formations all around looking like human faces
like Gods

He comes to a little hill and sits on it looking down across
a plain The moment seems to be biblical JIM face whitened
by dust stares into himself using the desert as a mirror

Amy sits down beside him and he doesn’t react
Then after a moment he puts an arm around her

JIM
I was in Morocco once and the
muzzein was going and the palms
a wind came up and they rattled and
I thought you know I hope that
isn’t god Because if god existed I
couldn’t deal with the humiliation
No one needs that class of
competition

JIM (CONTD)
Whatever Descartes says game’s
over if there’s a god There’s no
game if there’s a god

He looks at her

She nods

JIM (CONTD)
Do you know that I’m not a gambler

JIM (CONTD)
Would you know that if you saw me
with a needle in my arm that I’m
not a junkie

AMY
Yes I saw you being a professor
for three years and we know you’re
not one of those either What you
are is all yours Youre the
perfect example of how a person can
start out with no problems
whatsoever and make sure he has all
of them

JIM looks around at the desert getting it

AMY (CONTD)
Im pretty sure thats your
intention

JIM
Theres no relative degree of
suffering You want me to talk
about my problems My case for
them I wont I dont like people
with problems or the vanity to
bring them up Thats where Im
from Im like

AMY
And you think you dont need anyone
to talk to

JIM
I need a lot of things I gotta
wipe myself out first I need to

nothing then I can start

AMY
I dont think that you remember all
the things that you say or that

and always do the right thing
thats all there is to it

JIM
I did
She nods
AMY
Pretty simple but right on the

but

A BENTLEY the first of a fleet of three The door of the one
in front of the bus stop opens and NEVILLE steps out

NEVILLE
Lets take a walk

They do so and the three Bentleys follow at cortege speed

scanning everywhere

NEVILLE (CONTD)
My man over there said you 91ld

causes

JIM

NEVILLE

NEVILLE
Your grandfather pops and you don’t

grandfather He was a serious
motherfucker and I admire him for
leaving you in this situation

JIM
Thank you

NEVILLE
Of course you didnt run Theres
no fuckin terra incognita
(MORE)

NEVILLE (CONTD)
In the old days a white man in your
situation would come to America and
if things got hot in America in
the old West days youd go
somewhere else and be someone else
Become Bob Smith shoe horses in
East Asshole start a new family
no one gives a shit These days
were all stuck with being who we
are and where we are forever No
new world except maybe in the stars
when were all dead So we deal
with where we are and what we are

JIM
We deal with where we are as a
matter of fact What we are is a
matter of choice

NEVILLE gets it Theres nothing that Neville doesnt get He
releases JIM

NEVILLE
You know Lamar Hampton

JIM
No

NEVILLE
Don’t fuck with me

JIM
Student of mine

NEVILLE
Thing about Lamar is he’s from
white people land Grew up in the
goddamned Valley He has a uncle
though who is deep in the old
neighborhood in truth defines the
neighborhood in the sense that
hes in deep trouble one way or
another all the time — much like
yourself but not so volitionally —
and if I may say so talks a lot of
shit about Lamar because you see
he’s a lost soul the uncle one of
America’s poor You know about
Americas poor

JIM
Ive seen them
NEVILLE
Hes also stupid as a bag of
fuckin’ hammers and Lamar you
see is the ship he expects to come
in If a man is in having his leg
broke and he says my nephew is
Lamar Hampton who is going pro
maybe he does not have his leg
broke

JIM
What’s this got to do with
anything

NEVILLE
You know what it’s got to do with
everything How much you know
Lamar

JIM
I couldn’t say I know him

NEVILLE
You know his phone number Cause
his uncle don’t His uncle don’t
even know his own sister’s phone
number or exactly where she lives

uncle

machine Waits out “You have reached the office of Dean
Fuller”

JIM
This is Jim Look you’re a good
guy but I’m not coming back and I

He hangs up and looks into the empty refrigerator He opens a
square Tupperware container and takes out — a semi-automatic
pistol He snaps the action cocking it and starts to put it
to his headbut then puts it down

EXT JIMS HOUSE NIGHT

He stands on the porch of his dumpy house trying to regulate
his breathing calming down Lights show in the other houses
in the street Vignettes of life visible inside them

There is thunder and a heavy rain begins the canyons
immediately streaming with rain

INT JIM’S HOUSE DAY

Broad sunlight is shining into Jim’s room When his eyes open
he sees

MISTER LEE sitting in the armchair in the corner

MISTER LEE
What are we to do

A BIG KOREAN stands in the doorway He is in the final act of
disassembling JIM’S GUN He tosses the pieces one by one on
the bedspread

MISTER LEE (CONTD)
Human weaknessis not something I
discourage How could I I run
gambling establishments I loan
money I serve liquor in twenty-
seven restaurants and bars I make
my living from people in a
condition of sickness or stupidity
— but also I have revenues from
many intelligent people who should
know better This is not my
problem But there is one thing I
must hold on to

JIM
Whats that

MISTER LEE
I have to expect that a person
wants to live and will do anything
to live

(MORE)
MISTER LEE (CONTD)
Nothing makes sense if this is not
the case Do you want to live

MISTER LEE is clicking JIMS LIGHTER

JIM takes

JIM
Thats my business

MISTER LEE
I have not been in debt for many
years but I remember the feeling
To be obligated unbalanced in
ones thoughts insecure unclean
And I felt like that when I merely
had credit card debt and a
mortgage Nothing like you

this all on without comment
MISTER LEE (CONTD)

I think you want to hurt yourself
but make others do it for you

JIM can’t answer He looks at the HUGE KOREAN who is

at him

MISTER LEE (CONTD)
I come to see you myself because
youre an interesting man An
educated man Ordinarily my
associates would come without me

JIM
I’m not going to tell you I’1l get
the money because I don’t know if
I can I wouldn’t insult you

MISTER LEE
Thank you

JIM
I have madeerrors I could tell
you I’ve realized that I wish I
could turn over a new leaf that
Ill try to but it doesn’t make
any difference and I’m not going
to make any case for myself
whatsoever because there is no
case I have no position There’s
only one thing that mattersYou
expected your money and I don’t
have it The reasons are
irrelevant There we are

staring

MISTER LEE
How am I to collect

JIM
Theres only one way A gamble
Loan me another hundred thousand

MISTER LEE stares sitting with his palms on his thighs in a
shaft of sunlight He cocks an eyebrow

JIM (CONTD)

It’s how I got in It’s the only

way I’ll get out
MISTER LEE cocks his head
The KOREAN heavies start to laugh and JIM laughs too Then
he is conducted to the bathroom and his head is plunged into
the still-full bath
LATER

JIM sits against the bathroom tiles clutching a towel in his
lap OFF we hear the car doors close and the Koreans drive
away He struggles to his feet and looks at the mirror on
which has been written

MUNDAY
JIM (CONTD)
Thats not how you fucking spell
it
He shoulders out of the room

CUT TO

EXT JIM’S HOUSE IN THE HOLLYWOOD HILLS DAY

A WOMAN in a business suit and high heels is struggling to
put the twin stakes of a metal a “For Sale” sign into the
earth through the ground cover just off Jim’s driveway

INT JIM’S HOUSE IN THE HOLLYWOOD HILLS DAY

JIM — purposeful dressed shaved — watches a BOOKSTORE GUY
with a gray ponytail examining a book writing down a price
in a buckled notebook and then putting the book into a box
He is pricing out Jim’s library
JIM
Anything you don’t want stack it
in the fireplace

BOOKSTORE GUY
There’s not too much here that I
don’t want

JIM takes a last look — and goes out

INT A JEWELRY STORE DAY

An IRANIAN JEWELER wearing a great deal of gold
examining Jim’s watch

JEWELER
Perfectly good watch Why do you
want to sell it

JIM
Either I don’t need to know what
time it is or I need money What
do you care

JEWELER
I need to know if it is

JIM places his CA DRIVER’S LICENCE on the case

JIM
What you need to do is to come up
with an offer or not

JEWELER
There are so many of these

JIM looks away annoyed as the bullshit starts

JIM
Look that’s an Omega It’s worth
more than six thousand brand new
and when you have it no one will
know it isn’t brand new

JEWELER
You are insulting me

is

JIM
We’re not going to fuck around no
no no don’t talk to me I don’t
want you to name a price any more
and I need you to understand that
when I say what I want for it I am
giving you the figure that I will
take for it Do you understand me —
no no no No no Look at me I
will say the price and you will
either say yes or no

JEWELER
It is impossible to

JIM
All right

He puts the watch in his pocket

JEWELER
Wait wait wait

JIM
No I told you not to say anything
but yes or no You’re wasting my

time

JEWELER
I am willing to listen to your
price

JIM

You can’t counter it When I say my
figure that’s the figure and you
either say yes or no You got it

JEWELER
How can I say yes or no until I
hear the price

JIM
You’re not getting it

JEWELER
I am getting it I am getting it

JIM puts the watch on the counter pad again and the JEWELER
picks it up He wants it

JIM
You need to understand fully that
what I say is not an opening
figure

(MORE)

JIM (CONTD)
You can say yes or no you cannot
say a lower figure and expect to
meet at some point in the middle
Do you understand

JEWELER
Yes yes I understand What is
your price

JIM
You can’t say another price
JEWELER
I know I know I know I get it
JIM
Three thousand five hundred
dollars
JEWELER
(involuntarily)

One thousand

JIM takes the watch and goes ON JEWELER as the door chime
goes

JEWELER (CONTD)
Twelve hundred

EXT THE STREET OUTSIDE DAY

JIM is walking away quickly when THE JEWELER catches him at
the head of the crosswalk

JEWELER
I can’t help myself

JIM
Yes you can

THE JEWELER looks confused

JEWELER
Two thousand

JIM presses the WALK BUTTON
JEWELER (CONTD)

Why don’t you let a man do
business

JIM
Because you want to go home and sit
there chuckling tonight about how
you skinned a guy on his watch You
don’t need the watch you just want
the watch Where the “need” comes
in is you needing to fuck me up the
ass in order for you to feel all
right about yourself

JEWELER
I am in business You don’t
understand

JIM
Thirty-five hundred dollars Cash

JEWELER
(involuntarily)
Two thousand two hundred
(in a panic as JIM starts
off)
OK OK three thousand

JIM leans his head against a lamp-post

JIM
If I allow you to beat me for five
hundred dollars which you really
need to do on some deep personal
level will you just shut up and
give me the money in cash

JEWELER
Yes

JIM
You can’t say anything else

JEWELER
I won’t say anything else

JIM
You promise

JEWELER
I promise to God

JIM
I need you to promise because
youre fucking pathological

THE JEWELER touches his heart

JEWELER
Please we will have tea
As they walk in tandem back to the store

JEWELER (CONTD)
I don’t have the cash

JIM
Ill take a check
EXT A CAFE IN BEVERLY HILLS DAY

JIM is sitting at a table with a beer untouched in front of
him He looks up as AMY sits down They sit there silently

AMY
Well

JIM
Well

AMY

There’s quite a lot of talk over at
the department

JIM
Good

He drinks some of his beer
JIM (CONTD)
I already cashed out my IRA through
the credit union I’m selling my

booksI’m selling my house

AMY
What are you doing

JIM
Raising money

AMY
To pay everybody back right

JIM doesnt look at her

JIM
To gamble or to run away

JIM looks at her and doesnt answer
AMY
I sit here and I wonder did I
precipitate some sort of breakdown

JIM
There was a studentjust the
other daywho said that my
problem if one’s nature is a
problem rather than just
problematic is that I see things
in terms of victory or death and
not just victory but total victory
And it’s true I always have It’s
either victory or don’t bother
The only thing worth doing is the
impossible Everything else is
gray You’re bornas a man
with the nerves of a soldier the
apprehension of an angel to lift a
phrase but there is no use for it
Here Where’s the use for it
Youre set up to be a philosopher
or a king or Shakespeare and this
is all they give you This Twenty-
odd years of school which is all
instruction in how to be ordinary
-or they’1l fucking kill you
they fucking will and then its a
career which is not the same thing
as existence I want unlimited
things I want everything A real
love A real house A real thing to
doevery day Id rather die if I
dont get it

AMY
Please don’t go with them

He gets up and walks over to the car HEAVY ONE (who is
really heavy) holds the back door open and then gets in with
JIM and HEAVY TWO in the back and the car pulls off

INT BENTLEY MOMENTS LATER

HEAVY ONE
Your house for sale

A BENTLEY has pulled up at the curb Two BLACK GUYS in it
staring at JIM

JIM rides crammed between the TWO HEAVIES Rodeo to Wilshire

JIM
Gotta raise some money somewhere

HEAVY ONE
In this market I wouldn’t count on
the real estate
(to HEAVY TWO)
Check him

HEAVY TWO goes through every one of Jim’s pockets and only
comes up with a few dollars and the fresh CHECK from the
jeweler

HEAVY ONE (CONTD)
What’s this

JIM
Sold my watch

HEAVY ONE
This ain’t gonna cover it

HEAVY TWO throws a bag over Jim’s head a hotel laundry bag
from the Peninsula and tightens the draw string shoving Jim
onto the floor of the car Heavy two counts out the money
that Jim did have - thirty-two bucks puts it in his pocket
and settles in to enjoy the ride

HEAVY TWO
My theory is there’s no need to be
unpleasant My associate here would
like to beat your fuckin’ head in
until the shit you’ve got for
brains was all over the fucking
upholstery but that’s more about
his nature than necessity I expect
you know your situation is serious
and lets leave it at that
Internet age don’t solve anything
but you leave your laptop up and
running when you’ve got “Find my
iPhone” open homes then shit
happens

(MORE)

HEAVY TWO (CONTD)
As for your books that white dude
with the bald head and the stupid
fuckin’ pony tail is sending the
check to the right party for the
cover price on everything cause I
renegotiated for you and I doubt
that realtor lady with her badly
unstaged open house is still as
cool about black people as she was
when she started her day but all
in all it’s another perfect day in
Los Angeles and lets all get
along Let’s all just get along and
be really fuckin’ happy we’re not
somewhere else because you go off
LA you go on it but go home to
Detroit in February and you have no
fuckin’ trouble coming back out
here and having Los Angeles bend
over so you can kiss its ass

EXT A STREET IN DOWNTOWN LA DAY

The BENTLEY pulls into a little driveway beside a derelict
one story building that bears the sign “AFRICA MEMBERSHIP
CLUB” (which has a WHITE BUM talking to himself in the
boarded up entryway) and disappears behind the building

INT AFRICA MEMBERSHIP CLUB DAY

THE PENINSULA LAUNDRY BAG is ripped off JIM’S HEAD and he
reels back blinking NEVILLE sits looking at him smoking a
cigar He is wearing a perfect suit with English shoulders
He is on the phone He holds up a finger and turns away THE
AFRICA MEMBERSHIP CLUB is a former function hall RAT TRAPS
are set along the walls An unexplained white tennis shoe
lies on the floor with blood on it

HEAVY ONE
You scared

JIM
That’s my problem

HEAVY ONE rummages for water behind the bar

HEAVY ONE
We have Fiji and this stuff

JIM
Doesn’t matter
JIM

JIM

JIM

HEAVY TWO
When did it all become about
hydration

HEAVY ONE
Recently man Recently In my
youth everybody was carbo-loading

says

HEAVY TWO
Sit the fuck down with your water

sits down NEVILLE ends his call and comes forward from
shadows at the end of the room

NEVILLE
You gave me the wrong number for
Lamar That is fuckin’ feeble Do
you know what I also know

JIM
What’s that

NEVILLE
Do you think all Koreans are all
Korean and shit and don’t
communicate with the American
Negro

JIM
I don’t know anything

NEVILLE
I hear that you asked Mister Lee to
stake you out of your situation
That he give you enough to have
another shot at the title of the
world’s stupidest asshole By the
way you are not to say anything to
Mister Lee about the information I
have lest he speculate about the
source

JIM
If you have a source you know he
didnt give me anything

NEVILLE
You do know that all of your money
is mine
JIM
All of it forever or just what I
owe you

NEVILLE
Don’t be ridiculous All of it
forever

JIM
If that were true we’re not talking
money any more and you better kill
me because my only option then
because I’m not the world’s
stupidest white asshole would be
to kill you I want to pay you off
not to be married to you

NEVILLE
All right all right I only want
my money

JIM
Then I can deal with that

NEVILLE
Youre going to tell me how you’re
gonna make good on your debt right
now Gimme Lees money

JIM

He didnt front me any
NEVILLE

Fuck you
JIM

Your informations wrong

NEVILLE
How you gonna pay me

JIM
Well What if I told you I quit my
job and I’m going to write a novel

NEVILLE
Yeah what the first one make

JIM
With the advance and royalties
seventeen thousand dollars all in

NEVILLE
Fuck me For one of the better
reviewed first novels of 2007 I
think we have to make some other
arrangements The culture evidently
has Lets talk cash first and
other business later You can’t get
cash from your family

JIM
I got all I could get

NEVILLE
Could I get cash from your family
if I sent you down to Mexico —
whoops I don’t know what happened
to him — and had my friend Valerio
send them your dick

JIM
My family didn’t make their money
because they pays up easy

NEVILLE
Well that’s apparently genetic
Genetics is a cruel fuckin’
mistress Would you come up with
any money if I lit this cigar and
put it out on your eyeball

JIM
I’m not a magician

NEVILLE
If you didn’t think you was fuckin’
magic occasionally you wouldn’t be
in the Africa Membership Club
sitting there with a bottle of Fiji
water owing me almost two hundred
thousand dollars Guess what

JIM
What

NEVILLE
I already asked your mother

He sits down affably

NEVILLE (CONT’D)
You see my lawyer went to her
lawyer and her lawyer came back to
my lawyer and said “Fuck you”

JIM
Did he say it just like that

NEVILLE

As a matter of fact he did I’m
gonna need the equity in your
house We’ll paper it right As a
sale But that means I have to take
over the fuckin’ mortgage and get
some goddamned vice-president of
animation or some other cocksucker
to rent it and I don’t like that
shit But you gotta make the turnip
bleed from whatever hole it’s got

(a beat)
Now Lamar who you gave me the
wrong phone number for

JIM
Lamar’s a good kid he doesn’t need
any of this shit

NEVILLE
You’re not gonna say you made a
mistake with the number

JIM
No I didn’t I gave you a fake
one I made it up

NEVILLE
Well Mister Jones here is gonna
give you a real one

HEAVY TWO punches JIM and knocks him out of the chair The
skin is split by Jim’s left eye-socket He pushes himself up
off the floor and stands

NEVILLE (CONTD)
That’s the last time you lie to me
Lamar don’t need your help Every
man has to go it alone Lamar has
to make his choice Let him make
it But I’m not going to call him
now It would merely confuse the
issue You’re gonna get me Lamar
It will be more than an
introduction I don’t want an
introduction any more I want Lamar
doing what I need him to do without
him ever seeing my face
Deniability is where it’s at I
hear Lamar is all Hamlet and shit
because he wants to go pro

JIM
(bleakly)
Yeah he does

NEVILLE
I need Lamar and I need him before
they play Michigan tomorrow at
home They’re running eight points
on Michigan You tell Lamar if he
wants he can win by seven - no
more But you get him for tomorrow
Or Ill kill every member of your
family and show you the pictures
before I kill you Can I consider
you incentivized

JIM stares at him

INT JIM’S PERSONAL OFFICE ENGLISH DEPARTMENT DAY

He is cleaning out rubbish papers whatever He isn’t really
cleaning He runs a coin over his fingers thinking Then
looks up at a sound JONES is there

JONES
May I come in

JIM shrugs

JONES (CONTD)
May I sit

JIM is uncomfortable with that

JONES (CONTD)
I thought the end would be heroic
in some way Not just — not showing

up

JIM
Well now however it happened now
youre the Shakespeare guy Road’s
open brother I hope you seriously
give a fuck because I don’t and it
would be nice to think that someone
did Be all that you can be and
have a nice day

JONES
We clubbed together and got you
something

He rummages in his bag and brings out a small wrapped GIFT
JIM reluctantly takes it

JONES (CONTD)
In all honesty I wish you were
disliked But you know that’s not
the case and from time to time I
have found you admirable charming
compelling and stupendously
fucking brilliant much to my
horror Though your erasure from
the department can only be viewed
from my perspective as a positive

LAMAR has ducked through the door and towers over JONES

JONES (CONTD)
Good afternoonI am not void of
the fear that you will go on and
through some endeavor or
accomplishment make my existence
seem comparatively wretched

LAMAR
Did I come in at the wrong time

JIM
No he was just finishing up saying
that he wishes I was dead

JONES
Well Bonne chance

He ducks out JIM sit looking at Lamar

JIM
Sit down

LAMAR does JIM can’t speak to him yet LAMAR looks at Jim

LAMAR
What happened to your face man

JIM
A little while ago you came to me
for advice about turning pro I
know it’s about your knee I know
you have a feeling you have to put
money in the bank

LAMAR
I do man I’m afraid every day
that the knee will go

(MORE)
LAMAR (CONTD)
I’m afraid every day anyone will
even notice it because then I
get

JIM
Howd you like to make two hundred
and fifty thousand dollars in two
hours

LAMAR
Depends on what you have in mind

JIM
Throwing a game You can’t beat
Michigan by more than seven points

LAMAR takes that on

LAMAR
Well that’s not throwing a game
That’s winning by less than eight
That’s not throwing a game Who
wants me to do it

JIM points to his eye

LAMAR (CONT’D)
What they got on you

JIM
It doesn’t matter

LAMAR
I don’t want to talk to nobody I
don’t want to see nobody I don’t
want to hear no names I’1l take
the money from you - and I’1l take
it up front

JIM
That’s the way it works

JIM reaches beneath his desk and brings up a SPORTS BAG
puts it on the desk LAMAR looks into it

LAMAR
They fucked you up They didn’t
need to fuck you up I’d have done
it

JIM
I needed it They’ll fuck you up if
you need it too You gotta
deliver

LAMAR holds the bag

LAMAR
I bet you wish I don’t take this

JIM
That’s up to you

LAMAR takes the bag

LAMAR
I’m not gonna be immortal in this
game Pretty soon I’m just gonna be
a real fuckin’ tall dyslexic guy
selling fuckin’ Buicks I’m gonna
take what I can get

JIM nods
LAMAR (CONT’D)
I take this bag I get you out of
trouble

JIM nods

LAMAR (CONT’D)
That’s the other reason to do it

He stands up At the door he says
LAMAR (CONTD)
This is nothing on you I done it
before I need you to know that
JIM nods
LAMAR goes
JIM slowly unwraps the package given to him by the asshole on
behalf of the department Inside is a small statue a
representation of a bird ideogrammatically Freedom itself
JIM
Well all right

grabs Jim’s lapels in his fists and hoists him leglessly
upright

And as MISTER LEE contemplates his own gamble

CUT TO

INT ARENA NIGHT

WE follow the players from the UCLA locker room out into the
light the explosions of cheering details of the watching
fans A big crowd JIM sits way up in the gods watching
down The players of both teams are warming up and among
them swishing one is LAMAR looking cold and complicated
and alone THE GAME AND HOW TO HANDLE IT shoot a real game
then bring back a quarter of the crowd and all the refs and
players LAMAR is the only actor and he must be a great
basketball player at the level his character is intended to
be JIM watches uncertainly

And lets go to TOBACK

As the game progresses several things become apparent LAMAR (though looking flashy and from appearances of
form easily the best player on the court) is playing a
horrid game - throwing the ball away missing shots allowing
his man to score He is so good at his act that he makes it
appear to be a lack of quickness or grace on the other
players’ part that is to blame The rest of the UCLA team is playing remarkably well
Wild shots are falling through loose balls are bouncing
lucky rebounds are coming perfectly off MICHIGAN is having a bad night Only because of LAMAR’s
errors is anything at all going right for them There is a
lid over the rim for their shooters and they throw the ball
away continually Consequently there is rising sense of panic in JIM (and
distress in FRANK) When LAMAR loses the ball to a Michigan
playing who in turn loses it to a UCLA player who scores the
Michigan coach calls a time-out At this point UCLA leads 47
to 40 with 808 remaining in the game so that JIM and ONE are
only one point ahead of what they need JIM sees the coach
motion LAMAR to the bench and another player to get up to
replace him The new player joins the huddle LAMAR on his
way to the bench glances up nervously

INT AFRICA MEMBERSHIP CLUB CONTINUOUS
NEVILLE and POSSE are watching on TV

UP IN THE BOOTH

TWO JOCK-SNIFFERS ANNOUNCER AND COLOR MAN

ANNOUNCER
With one exception UCLA has played
great ball tonight and
ironically that exception is Lamar
Hampton who has been the leader of
the club this seasonhes having
a bad night

COLOR MAN
Hes lost the ball repeatedly and
his defense is sub-par

ANNOUNCER

Lets be serious a sub-par Lamar
is better than anybody else on this
court Were judging Lamar by Lamar
and maybe thats not fair

COLOR MAN
Its fair to judge a man against
his best

On JIM (off this idea) as the buzzer sounds ending the time-
out As the game recommences JIM leaves the arena fighting
his way through the crowd The SCOREBOARD shows UCLA up by
exactly 5 JIM cant think about it he keeps going As he
goes we hear a roar from the crowd

LAMAR puts on a dazzling exhibition of ball control - passing
up several easy shots as he dribbles out the clock during
the last five seconds before the buzzer sounds to end the
game he dribbles under the Michigan basket unmolested -
passing up an easy chance to score - and then (the game
finished the buzzer going) - twirls the ball on the tip of
his finger like a Harlem Globetrotter and stares over at

HIS COACH who stares aghast

LAMAR throws the ball away and walks off the court UCLA has
won by exactly seven

JIM walking along hears his cell phone ring He looks at
the screen which reads

DEXTER

JIM
Hows Vegas

He listens

that weve seen before guarded by Koreans

INT KOREATOWN GAMBLING DEN HALLWAY NIGHT

JIM comes up some stairs and heads down a corridor
door guarded by two KOREAN GUYS we have never seen
stops One of them snaps his fingers and JIM hands
a CARD with Korean writing on ita passport from

towards a
before He
over first
Mister

Leeand then for inspection the DUFFEL The BIGGEST

KOREAN looks up in wonder after inspecting what is

inside

Then they open the doorand Jim passes through into
INT KOREATOWN GAMBLING DEN NIGHT

Another world At low tables around the room Korean
businessmen are drinking and being served by submissive
attentive women They refill the men’s glasses and cut their
food for them

JIM backpack on his shoulder stands looking at the GAMING
TABLES

Blackjack roulette the usual All games here are played
with CASH — masses of cash deployed by not only Asian
businessmen but serious and rich professional gamblers In a
side room poker is being played at a lighted baize table

JIM refocuses on the roulette wheel obsessively He moves
forward Then stops All or nothing what about nothing For
the first time the tables have no allure

MISTER LEE materializes

MISTER LEE
You have my money

JIM looks at him

MISTER LEE (CONTD)
If you have the money I advise you
not to play Its all over

JIM
I know that

MISTER LEE
My partner is in the corner

JIM looks not wanting to The PARTNER is a big Korean
having his meat cut for him by a bottle girl He is merely a
businessmanexcept for the security with folded arms JIM
looks back at Mister Lee and then at the TABLES

MISTER LEE (CONTD)
If you lose the money does not go
to me

JIM
I know that

FRANK and BIG ERNIE have entered They see JIM in the room
standing with MISTER LEE and instead of approaching (FRANK
looks worried) they move to the BAR from which they can
observe JIM

JIM is very aware of them very aware too of Mister Lee’s
HEAVIES

MISTER LEE
I cannot take money off you by
force in here

JIM
I know that That’s why we’re here
I told you we were going to gamble

They stare at each other

MISTER LEE
You have enough money to pay me
JIM
Yes
MISTER LEE
You must come outside
JIM
No
MISTER LEE

JIM nods

MISTER LEE (CONT’D)

JIM indicates FRANK and is now watching the ROULETTE WHEEL
The ball doing its thing

JIM (CONTD)

MISTER LEE

for
JIM

MISTER LEE

Let me have my money
JIM surges forward
BIG ERNIE intercepts him

BIG ERNIE
What the fuck are you doing

JIM looks down at the hand holding his coat A KOREAN BOUNCER
comes and deliberately removes BIG ERNIE’S HAND

BIG ERNIE (CONT’D)
What the fuck are you doing

FRANK is standing alarmed by the bar BIG ERNIE is hustled
out of the room going along because it would be very unwise
not to

JIM goes to a table unzips his backpack and stacks his cash
on the table He discards the backpack He picks up the block
of cash and heads towards the roulette table

JIM moves forward fast and puts HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF
THOUSAND DOLLARS in cash on the table all the money he has
made in Vegas from betting on Lamars game less what he paid
Neville Baraka putting down one lump of cash after another

The croupier stares
Jims gaze wanders over the tablereds and blacks blurring

He is dimly aware of SPECTATORS crowding inFRANKMISTER
LEE

JIM
All on black

THE CROUPIER spins the wheel The ball goes into the wheel
JIM closes his eyes and listens to the clatter of the ball

IMAGES cascade through his mind the DESERT SUNRISE AMY in
the desert his child staring at him from a basin in the
delivery room his mother himself leaning in a balcony
doorway and looking out over a foreign city on the best
morning of his life an image of a typewriter with a blank
page on which we PUSH IN

We are on his face covered with sweat when the clatter of
the ball stops There is nothing but silence from the Korean
spectators

JIM opens his eyes and sees
THE BALL LYING IN BLACK

JIM turns immediately from the table and begins walking out
of the establishment out of everything

FRANK is staring

THE OWNER of the ESTABLISHMENT is standing right in front of
him JIM walks up to him

JIM (CONTD)
I was playing for Mister Lee and
for that gentleman over there

He points at FRANK who stands there stunned

JIM (CONTD)
I’m not actually a gambler

Everyone watches as he crosses the room and goes to the
door and is let through by Koreans
EXT THE BUILDING IN KOREATOWN NIGHT

FRANK and BIG ERNIE come out escorted as far as the
sidewalk carrying the winnings FRANK looks around and sees

JIM leaning against the black borrowed MERCEDES flipping the
car key in his hand

BIG ERNIE and FRANK come up to him There’s not much to say
JIM holds out the car key and FRANK takes it

FRANK
You need a ride

JIM shakes his head

JIM
No I’1l walk I feel like walking

FRANK
You got anything on you

JIM
Not a fucking cent brother

FRANK
That’s not “fuck you” position

JIM
Yes it is

FRANK
Then say it to me

JIM

FRANK

JIM shoves off the car and begins to walk down the old
downtown street as SCORE comes up and carries us along into
his new world (needless to say this is about the music) we

CUT TO

EXT AMYS BUILDING NIGHT TOWARDS DAWN

ESTABLISH THE BUILDING with its red Los Altos sign lit now
for the first time in the film

We are at Jims POV

JIM stands across the street head slightly cocked looking
at the building hands in the pockets of his coat He seems
for a moment to have his old look his solitary look and
moves on along the sidewalk to pass the Los Altos bybut
then he stops and looks again and crosses the deserted
boulevard the way he walked towards the roulette wheel in
Koreatown

MOMENTS LATER

He is leaning humped in his coat in the entrance way He
takes a deep breath hes redeemed its over He reaches and
(in the greatest act of his life) presses the intercom
button

FROM ACROSS THE BOULEVARD

We see JIM now a small figure waiting for the doorbell to
be answered Finally he pushes through the glass and goes
inside and as a RED AND BLACK VAN wipes the screen very close
we go to
