BAD DAY AT BLACK ROCK

ESTABLISHING SHOT - BLACK ROCK - PART OF TOWN FOCAL
POINT

RAILROAD STATION

abandoned in an extreme state of dilapidation The
structure

is blistered by the resolute sun the roof is weather-
warped

Dry rot and mildew wage a relentless battle against the

foundation Between the building and the tracks is a
long

somewhat narrow platform its floorboards twisted by
time

termites and the elements The match-board overhang of
the

building throwing some little shade to a portion of
the

platform sags and bellies From the overhang is
appended a

rectangular panel on which in flaky paint the town is
identified

and

One of the broken wires holding the panel is longer
other cocking the sign irregularly

The railroad tracks reach endlessly into the horizon
the town on each side stretches the ocean-like prairie
sand dunes rising and falling monotonously shouldering

other toward infinity The morning sun lays over this
wasteland of the American Southwest a gigantic yellow

from which heat waves like bloodshot arteries spread
themselves over the poisoned sky

A small shack stands next to the station separated

by a narrow alleyway and leaning toward the larger

as if for support The words POSTAL TELEGRAPH are arced
its dusty vitrine An old straight-backed chair

with twisted wire is tilted against the north-west

of the shack In it is Mr Hastings the postal

agent a man of middle years and exorbitant mediocrity
sits there spinelessly fingering a wart on his

chin and once in a while for variety rubbing a
under his watery nose

FULL SHOT - BLACK ROCK

The town is minute dismal and forgotten crouching in
isolation where the single line of railroad track

a secondary dirt road The twin strips of steel glisten
the fierce sunlight fencing the dreary plain from the
fronts of the town In bg is the bluff of a black
mountain Against this ancient mass the houses of Black

The town and the terrain surrounding it have if

else the quality of inertia and immutibility --
moves not even an insect nothing breathes not even
wind Town and terrain seem to be trapped caught and
forever in the sullen abrasive earth

ANOTHER ANGLE - MACREEDY AND PORTER

The porter puts the suitcase on the platform In the

the town and its people are seen staring silently
motionlessly The big man glances toward them He

sad distasteful greeting to the town its wretched
its mean modest buildings The porter disappears into

train as the conductor enters scene He turns slowly
following Macreedys gaze

CONDUCTOR
(softly staring at
the towns people)
Man They look woebegone and far
away

MACREEDY
(looking around)
Ill only be here twenty-four hours

CONDUCTOR
In a place like this it could be a
lifetime
(turning to face
Macreedy)
Good luck Mr Macreedy

Macreedy nods his thanks The conductor signals the

begins

to move picking up speed The cars slip past until
quite

suddenly the Streamliner is gone For a moment
Macreedy

watches it Then quite unconsciously he takes a
package of

cigarettes from his left hand pocket taps the last one
free

of the pack sticks it between his lips and crumpling
the

empty pack drops it beside the tracks He takes a
cardboard

book of matches flicks it open bends a match in half
with

agile fingers and with a sure frictional motion
scrapes the

head against the sandpaper guard The match flares the

cigarette is lit Macreedy inhales exhales deeply and

turns

to pick up his suitcase Then he sees Hastings who
walks

slowly almost painfully to him His Adams apple
grapples

protestingly with his collar After a moment he
controls it
sufficiently to talk

HASTINGS
You for Black Rock

MACREEDY

Thats right

HASTINGS

There must be some mistake Im
Hastings the telegraph agent Nobody
told me the train was stopping

HASTINGS

I just said they didnt and they
ought to What I -- want to know

MACREEDY

streamliner stopped here in four
years

INT HOTEL

It is a typical small town hotel but crummier with a
lobby Macreedy is waiting at the empty desk as Hector
in flopping his enormous bulk into a nicked and mothy
He picks up a newspaper but his eyes remain on
Macreedy waits patiently for the absent clerk For a
he studies the open registration ledger his eyes rove
the ink-splotched blotter up over the desk to one of

World War II banners the imitation silk now stained
faded It depicts a shrieking eagle rampant clutching

The

Flag in a claw Under it the legend

GOD BLESS AMERICA

Near it a tacky placard proclaims

DO ALL THE GOOD YOU CAN

BY ALL THE MEANS YOU CAN

IN ALL THE WAYS YOU CAN

AT ALL THE TIMES YOU CAN

TO ALL THE PEOPLE YOU CAN

AS LONG AS EVER YOU CAN

Feeling the eyes of Hector on him Macreedy turns
Hector

meets his gaze with bland insolent interest Now a
young

man (his name is PETE) comes out of a small room behind
the

registration desk and walks up to it There is a
softness

about his regular features a certain indefinable
sugariness
about his mouth He seems tight-lipped for lorn and

uneasy
as he faces Macreedy across the counter
MACREEDY
(pleasantly)
Id like a room
PETE
All filled up
MACREEDY
(a beat)
Got any idea where I might --
PETE
(stiffly shaking his
head)
This is 1945 mister Theres been a
war on
Macreedy looks at the young man with impeccable
tolerance
Without shifting his gaze he slowly lets fall his
small

suitcase It thuds softly on the frayed carpet
before

firmly

it a

runs

on

MACREEDY
I thought it ended a couple of months
ago

PETE
Yeah but the OPA lingers on

Macreedy looks down at the open ledger on the desk
him The clerk reaches out to close it Gently yet
Macreedy stops him reopening the big book He studies
finger straying unconsciously inside his collar He

it to relieve the starchy stiffness

Pete begins to fidget

PETE
You dont know about the OPA

MACREEDY
(without looking up)
Tell me
PETE

Well for establishments with lessn
fifty rooms hotel keepers got to
report regularly about

His voice fades desperately

PETE
about tenants and and
registration
(drawing himself up)
There are penalties imposed

Again his voice trails off

MACREEDY
(eyes still on the
ledger)
You seem to have lots of vacancies

PETE
(uncomfortable)
Well as I said

Macreedy leans over the counter to a rack of keys He
Hector

his splayed fingers over the key rack as

MACREEDY
Lots of vacancies

PETE
Theyre everyone of em locked up
Some are show rooms

MACREEDY
Yes
PETE
(with touching
sincerity)
for cattle buyers feed salesmen
The others -- theyre spoken for

rented to cowboys ranch hands
(Macreedy listens
respectfully)
They pay by the month For when they
come into town We provide for their
every wish and comfort
(weakly)
You understand

MACREEDY
Not really But while Im pondering
it get a room ready Just for
tonight

rack at random)

Pete opens his mouth but no sound comes out

Macreedy pauses and takes in the situation He refuses
to be

baited

MACREEDY

MACREEDY

as to a child)
All I want from you is a little
information Ive got to get to a
place called Adobe Flat

TIM
(reacts then tight-
lipped)
This aint no information bureau

Macreedy starts to say something then stops

MACREEDY
One thing about Black Rock --
everybodys polite Makes for gracious
living

TIM
Nobody asked you here

MACREEDY
How do you know
(he moves toward the
door with a rueful
grin)

TIM
(starting after him)

What about Adobe Flat

MACREEDY
Im looking for a man named Komako

The Sheriff reaches for his bottle In his haste he

drops
it Macreedys hand moves quickly catching the bottle
before
it hits the floor
MACREEDY
Almost a disaster
TIM
(sinking back in his
chair)
A fate worsen death
(he takes the bottle
from Macreedy)
You move fast for a crip fora

For a moment heavy silence Finally
MACREEDY
What about Komako
TIM
(slowly)
If theres no further questions
Macreedy grins harshly and exits Tim watches him go
then
slowly reaches for the bottle He pauses looks at his
shaking
hand Then he withdraws it and just sits in the chair
staring
blindly ahead seeing nothing

Macreedy stops looks toward Smith as he walks out to

Thats the friendliest word Ive
heard since I got here
As Smith joins him he walks on Smith falls in step

him GO WITH THEM

SMITH

(grins boyishly)
My name is Smith I own the Triple-
Bar ranch

(holds out his hand

Macreedy shakes it)
I want to apologize for some of the
folks in town

MACREEDY
They act like theyre sitting on a
keg

SMITH

A keg Of what

MACREEDY
I dont know Maybe diamonds Maybe
gunpowder

SMITH
(disarmingly)
No Nothing like that Were a little
suspicious of strangers is all
Hangover from the old days The old
West

MACREEDY
I thought the tradition of the old
West was hospitality

SMITH
(with a sincere smile)
Im trying to be hospitable Mr
Macreedy
(boyishly pushes his
dusty cap back on
his head)
Going to be around for a while

MACREEDY
Could be

SMITH
How would you like to go hunting
tomorrow Id be proud to have you
as my guest

MACREEDY
Thanks but Im afraid not

SMITH

(with admirable candor)
You mean because of your arm

shoulder ina

friendly

understanding gesture)
I knew a man once lost an arm ina
threshing accident Used to hunt all
the time

(almost too blandly)
But he was quite a man He

discreet and charming

gravity)
Im sorry I What I mean is -- if

MACREEDY

Never mind Thanks anyway

SMITH
(quietly)

SMITH
He got here in 41 -- just before
Pearl Harbor Three months later he
was shipped to one of those relocation
centers

Tough

MACREEDY
Which one did he go to

SMITH
Who knows

MACREEDY
You think maybe if I wrote him the
letter would be forwarded

SMITH
Im sure it would Write your letter
Ill see it gets out tonight

MACREEDY
It wouldnt be too much trouble

SMITH
No trouble at all

MACREEDY
Funny Because I think it would be a
great deal of trouble for you Its
been a great deal of trouble for me

At this point they are in front of
EXT LIZS GARAGE
Macreedy stops as does Smith He looks keenly at Smith

he takes from his inner jacket pocket a half-dozen

MACREEDY
I wrote these letters to Komako
They werent forwarded They were
returned -- address unknown
(he smiles grimly at
Smith)
So I guess theres nothing you can
do for me after all

Smith opens his mouth to reply when the NOISE of a jeep

interrupts him The jeep comes INTO SHOT Liz Brooks
at the

wheel cuts the engine and jumps out Smith ambles
silently

to a wall and leans against it Liz reaches behind the

drivers seat and hoists with both hands and some
effort a

five-gallon drum of axle grease from the floor of the

jeep
As she rests it on the rear fender
MACREEDY
(going to her)
Need a little help
The girl looks at Smith who has made no attempt to
help
her
LIZ
I can manage
She lifts the drum to the ground
MACREEDY
Well I need a little help
(she looks at him
questioningly)
Id like to rent your jeep
LIZ
Itll be two dollars an hour gas
extra and ten dollars for my time
SMITH
(to Liz)
Arent you going to ask him where he
wants to go
Liz looks from Smith to Macreedy puzzled
SMITH
He wants to go to Adobe Flat
Liz hesitates Macreedy notes her confusion as her eyes
seek

Smiths for instructions Quickly he moves in
MACREEDY

LIZ
(nodding)
Yeah Its about six -- seven miles

MACREEDY

Macreedy hands her a bill She fumbles with it not

knowing
what else to do Her eyes drift to Macreedys stiff
arm
LIZ
(uneasily)
I thought you might need a little
help
MACREEDY
I can manage
He steps toward the jeep as
SMITH
Liz Do you have a license to rent

He steps into jeep and with one hand expertly
manipulating

the controls drives off

In that case where do you suggest I

She turns walks back toward the lube pit

LIZ
(over her shoulders)
The jeeps not for rent

MACREEDY
It was just a few hours ago

LIZ
(flatly)
Things change

MACREEDY
(with grim amusement)
Sure And Smith is the kid who changes
em

She doesnt answer Macreedy goes to her

MACREEDY
Miss Brooks
(softly)
Whats the matter with this town of
yours

LIZ
Nothing Its none of your concern

MACREEDY
Then why are they all so concerned
about me

LIZ
Am I concerned
MACREEDY
No youre not But

LIZ
But what

MACREEDY
(easily)
But it strikes me youre a little
too unconcerned So unconcerned you
wont even rent me a jeep

LIZ
(flaring)
I dont run a taxi service I dont
have a license

MACREEDY
I wish others in this town were as
scrupulously devoted to law and order
as you are

LIZ
(hotly)
Why dont you lay off If you dont
like it here go back where you came
from

MACREEDY
Funny thing They try to kill me
and you feel persecuted

LIZ
I dont want to get involved

MACREEDY
Involved in what

LIZ
(retreating)
Whatever youre up to Whatever
happens Ive got to go on living
here These people are my neighbors
my friends

MACREEDY
All of them

LIZ
(slowly)
This is my town Mr Macreedy like
it or not Whatever happened here
it was long ago now its its

MACREEDY
(evenly)
Dead and buried
(a beat)
Whatever did happen you dont seem
to like it Why do you stick around

LIZ
(after a beat)
Because of my brother Pete Hed
never leave

MACREEDY
Didnt you ever think of going without
him Youre sort of independent and
hes hes

LIZ
Weak I know Thats why I couldnt
leave him

MACREEDY
(softly)
What did your brother do

LIZ
He I
(flaring again)
What do you care What do you care
about Black Rock

MACREEDY

Nothing much Only therere not
many places like this in America --
but even one is too many Because I
think something sort of bad happened
here

(frowning)
Something I cant find the handle
to

LIZ
You just think so You dont know

MACREEDY
This much I know -- the rule of law
has been suspended in this town The
gorillas have taken over

LIZ
Youre a fine one to talk You come
in here sneaking around trying to
steal the key to my jeep

MACREEDY
I kind of had a notion that was the
only way I could get it

She opens her mouth to answer but she doesnt know

what to

say

MACREEDY
(simply)
Was I wrong Miss Brooks

He waits as she tries to answer and again she cant
For a

moment he watches her struggle in anguished silence
with

herself Then he turns and goes out

EXT MAIN STREET - MACREEDY

walks thoughtfully down street He comes abreast of
hotel

EXT PORCH OF HOTEL

where Smith is still sitting For a moment he watches
Macreedy

speculatively then

SMITH

(calling)
Mr Macreedy

(reasonably as

Macreedy turns toward

him)
Id like to ask you a few questions
as long as youre around

MACREEDY
(walking up steps)
Im around all right

He stands facing Smith on the porch then

MACREEDY
(with just a touch of
wryness)
You probably know that Miss Brooks
is no longer in the car rental
business

SMITH
(solemnly)
Good I wouldnt want to see that
girl get into trouble

MACREEDY
You wouldnt

SMITH
what with rental permits gas
rationing you know what I mean
MACREEDY
Sure I admire your sturdy sense of
responsibility
SMITH
(dismissively)
Its just a girl like that has a
future
MACREEDY

Lets talk about my future

SMITH
(almost slyly)
Do you have the time

MACREEDY
I dont seem to be going any place

He takes the other chair
SMITH

(after a pause)
I hear you handle a jeep real well

MACREEDY
I have a way with jeeps A certain
familiarity

SMITH
I think I understand Youre an Army
man

(looking at Macreedys
stiff arm)
Whered you get it

MACREEDY
Italy

SMITH
(sincerely)
Tough I tried to get in myself the
day after those rats bombed Pearl
Harbor

MACREEDY
What stopped you

SMITH
The physical They wouldnt take me
The morning after Pearl I was the
first man in line at Marine recruiting
in Sand City And they wouldnt take
me

MACREEDY
(flatly)
Tough

SMITH
What do you do in Los Angeles Mr
Macreedy

MACREEDY
Im retired

SMITH
Youre a pretty young man

MACREEDY
You might say I was forced into
retirement

SMITH
What were you looking for in Adobe
Flat

MACREEDY

Komako like I told you Like you
told me he wasnt there

Smith laughs quietly

MACREEDY
Whats so funny

SMITH
Nothing Its just -- I dont believe
you I believe a man is as big as
what he seeks I believe youre a
big man Mr Macreedy

MACREEDY
Flattery will get you nowhere

SMITH
Why would a man like you be looking
for a lousy Jap farmer

MACREEDY
Maybe Im not so big

SMITH

Yes you are

(a beat looking hard

at Macreedy)
I believe that a man is as big as
the things that make him mad Nobody
around here has been big enough to
make you mad

MACREEDY
What makes you mad Mr Smith

SMITH
Me Nothing in particular
MACREEDY
(bemused)
I see Youre a big man too Only
(calmly)

the Japanese make you mad

SMITH
Thats different After the sneak
attack on Pearl Harbor after
Bataan

MACREEDY

and Komako made you mad

SMITH
Its the same thing
(scoffing)
Loyal Japanese-Americans -- thats a

laugh Theyre mad dogs Look at
Corregidor the death march

MACREEDY
What did Komako have to do with
Corregidor
SMITH

Wasnt he a Jap Look Macreedy
theres a law in this county against
shooting dogs But if I see a mad
dog loose I dont wait for him to
bite me

(exhales sharply

shaking his head

with irritation)
I swear youre beginning to make me
mad

MACREEDY
(calmly)
All strangers do

SMITH
Not all Some of em When they come
here snooping

MACREEDY
Snooping for what

SMITH
I mean outsiders coming around
looking for something

MACREEDY
(pressing)
For what
SMITH

I dont know People are always
looking for something in this part
of the West To the historian its
the Old West To the book writers
its the Wild West To the
businessmen its the Undeveloped
West They all say were backward
and poor and I guess we are

(snorts)

We dont even have enough water
(a beat)

But this place to us is our West
(heatedly)

I just wish theyd leave us alone

MACREEDY
Leave you alone to do what

SMITH
(coldly)
I dont know what you mean

MACREEDY
What happened to Komako

SMITH
He went away I told you Shortly
after he left a bunch of kids got
fooling around out his place They
burned it down It was one of those
things -- you know how kids are

Macreedy laughs quietly

SMITH
Whats funny

MACREEDY
Nothing Only -- I dont believe
you Any more than I believed you
about the letters

SMITH
(smiling)
You dont seem to believe anything I
say
MACREEDY
(vaguely)
Yes I do -- about businessmen for

instance I think a businessman would
be interested in Adobe Flat

SMITH
Why

MACREEDY

All that land lying fallow Could be
put to some use Like a graveyard

(Smith opens his mouth

to speak but Macreedy

goes on)
A historian might be interested
too Because of the strange customs
around here such as burying cattle

SMITH
Burying cattle

MACREEDY
(calmly)
in

serves

pane

Somethings buried out there
He takes the wild flowers from his pocket holding them
front of Smith

MACREEDY
See these wild flowers That means a
grave Ive seen it overseas I figure
it isnt a mans grave or someone
would have marked it Sort of a
mystery isnt it

SMITH
Sort of Maybe you can figure it
out

Macreedy gets up half turns to Smith

MACREEDY
Maybe

He starts down the steps
SMITH
Why not give it a whirl
(Macreedy turns)
Itll help you pass the time
(continued
meaningfully)
for a while

MACREEDY

Not interested I got other things

to do
He turns and walks down the street

puts it down his gaze still fixed on the stranger

(after a beat
grimacing)

MACREEDY
Like Im a potential customer
Doc
Everybody is -- and I get em coming

He goes to a topographic map hanging on the wall -- a
large
impressive map -- faded fly-blown and divided into
sections

(rhetorically)

Is it gold

He bangs the rock down next to the scales

boc
It is not Do they quit They do
not
He moves to a third illustration -- a colored
large and impressive -- of acres upon green acres of

gesture toward

reproduction)
Then they decide to farm Farm In
country so dry you have to prime a

you can say Fat Sam theyre stalled

He moves to the coffins piled in a corner and runs his
down the smooth pine sides with loving tenderness

Doc

(simply)
So I bury em

(a beat as he rejoins

Macreedy in the center

of the room)
But why should I bore you with my
triumphs
MACREEDY
Yeah Ive got a problem of my own

Doc nods he points vaguely toward the street

Doc
(like an old testament

EXT REAR OF DOCS OFFICE
An old-fashioned hearse with plate glass sides and
lead candelabra -- Docs limousine -- is parked a few
from the door Macreedy climbs in behind the wheel as
comes out and stands on the small back porch
Macreedy turns on the ignition switch His foot kicks
the starter but the spark doesnt catch He tries
then again He pauses frowns as Doc comes down from
porch and joins him
MACREEDY

dashboard)
Wont start

(nervously to Macreedy)

Something wrong

MACREEDY
Just wont start

Again he presses the ignition switch Nothing And
in bg the great bulk of Hector David looms up

against the porch pillar at the corner of the alleyway
expression is almost dreamy For a moment he stands

there
while Macreedy toys with the ignition and the sick
engine
wheezes and grinds Then he ambles up to the hearse
HECTOR
(gratuitously)
Could be the wirin Why dont you
look under the hood
MACREEDY

loafers at the bar
then back at Smith)
Or are there too many witnesses
present
Macreedy walks slowly toward him holding the knife
only three feet apart Smiths hand goes to a pocket
inside over the outline of a pistol Sam glances from
to Smith to the unconscious Coley He sidles toward the
and runs out fast (NOTE From this point to end of
INTERCUT from Macreedy and Smith to exploit the

the loafers at the bar)
SMITH
(with effortless
ferocity)
Youre still in trouble

MACREEDY
So are you
(Smith snorts)
Whatever happens -- youre lost

SMITH
You got things a bit twisted

MACREEDY

You killed Komako Sooner or later
youll go up for it Not because you
killed him -- in this town you
probably could have gotten away with
it -- but because you didnt even
have the guts to do it alone You
put your trust in guys like him

(gesturing toward the

unconscious Coley)
and Hector -- theyre not the
most dependable of Gods creatures
Sooner or later theyll get the idea
youre playing them for saps What1ll
you do then -- peel them off one by
one And in the meantime if any one
of them breaks youll go down hard
Because they got something on you
Something to use when things get
tough

With a quick motion he tosses the knife to Smith

Smith
catches it
MACREEDY
And theyre getting tougher every
minute
He walks past Smith and goes out the door Self-
consciously
holding the knife Smith turns to face the loafers at
the
bar They say nothing they stare at him through him

INT HOTEL LOBBY

Doc sits deep in the battered upholstery of one of the
He stares fiercely across the room at Smith who is on
couch reading a neatly folded newspaper Behind him at

clerks desk Pete is fitfully involved in a game of
solitaire At the foot of the stairs Hector is pouring

into a slot machine It whines grinds and clicks with
rhythmic monotony but it never seems to pay off In

chair nearest Doc is Tim with one of his boots off He
hard and with some concentration removing the other
he places them neatly at the foot of his chair He

his toes -- watching them with some interest

The wheeze and whir of the slot machine stops The
silence turns the eyes of the men toward Hector and the
arm bandit They follow his gaze up the steps

walks down carrying his suitcase He goes to Pete at
clerks desk

MACREEDY
Anything for me
PETE
Nothing

MACREEDY
Any message -- a telegram

PETE
(returning to his
cards)
Nothing

gruffly)
In case youre interested Coleyll

(glaring at Smith and
Hector)

Im truly sorry to say

Smith coolly continues to read his paper It is Hector
who

turns toward Doc

HECTOR
(to Doc jerking a
fat hand toward
Macreedy)
Your friends pretty tough

DOC

Yeah Hes wicked He defends himself
when hes attacked

Macreedy ignores the exchange of words He walks across
the

frayed carpet to the nearest chair and drops into it
Doc

who has followed him stands looking down at Macreedy

long moment Then

boc
(with some irritation)

Well You going to just sit here
and let time run out

MACREEDY
Im waiting for a wire From the

boc
You sent it through Hastings
(an audible sigh)
Just dont expect an answer if thats
the way you sent it

MACREEDY
(looking toward the
door)
No
(he rises)

Doc follows his gaze as Hastings enters the lobby and
around He sees Macreedy coming toward him He walks

in an arc past Macreedy to Smith He holds out a Postal
Telegraph form Smith puts down his paper and takes it
Macreedy followed by Doc goes over to Smith Tim in

stockinged feet joins them

Smith scans the message He looks up to meet Macreedys
Smith rises Hector swaggers over from the slot
Hastings slips around the back of the couch protected
the barricade of Hectors great body

MACREEDY

(evenly to Smith)

I think thats for me
(he takes the message
from Smiths hand
and quickly glances
at it Looking up at
Hastings)

Wheres the answer

Hastings is silent A brittle expression of bemusement
Smiths features
SMITH
You expect an answer -- to a wire

thats never sent

Macreedys mouth compresses in a harsh grin

from

it

SMITH
Whats so funny

MACREEDY
Nothing Just a thought --
(his eyes turn to
Hastings Hastings
wilts)
-- a thought dazzling in its purity

Macreedy takes a step toward Hastings The telegraph
bounces away
MACREEDY
(slowly)

Youre in a jam Hastings You gave
my telegram to Smith

Doc
(excitedly)
You warty wretch Thats a federal
offense
MACREEDY
(to Smith)

Youre in deep too

(grins hard)
Like I said its getting tougher
and tougher

(to Tim)
Sheriff youd better do something
about this

Tim hesitates blinking his eyes worriedly shifting
one stockinged foot to the other Smith watches him
as he takes the message from Macreedy and gestures with
vaguely

I reckon thats right Mr Smith

He reaches out clawing the badge from Tims chest He
it on Hectors vest

SMITH

All right Sheriff Take over

You cant do that

SMITH
Cant I I put him in office Now I
take him out

Hector moves his elephantine bulk within inches of

Come on Hector
He walks out the new Sheriff strutting beside him
Hastings in their wake For a moment Macreedy Doc and

stand in the center of the lobby Pete eyes them non-
committally and goes back to his solitaire He glances

now and then moving the cards with a purposeful sort
slowness as of a more natural swiftness restrained by
preoccupation with the three men in the lobby

Macreedy is deep in thought Abstractedly he tugs at
collar and then repeats the ritual of lighting a

Tims shoulders are slumped Humiliation has corroded
flesh and soul Even Doc is momentarily subdued he
feels degraded unclean Macreedy looks from one to the
of the good ineffectual companions that circumstance

haphazardly tossed his way He takes a few steps to his
suitcase Doc and Tim trailing him Doc for want of

better to do Tim out of his deep inexpressible need
support Macreedy takes an untapped bottle of whiskey
his bag He thumbs the cork loose and holds the bottle
to Tim Tim takes a drink

The light on the clerks desk goes on and we are aware
day has gone and that night is falling The pressing
light has drained from the lobby leaving a shadowy
dreariness The shadows have lengthened and the silver

tarnished with the darkness
DOC

(hopefully)
Its all right Tim Were not licked
yet
TIM
(numbly)

Aint we I am

Doc
There comes a time Tim when a mans
just got to do something

TIM
Not me Im useless and I know it

boc
(imploring)
No man is useless if hes got a
friend

Pete comes out from behind the desk walking from one
lamp
in the lobby to another turning them on

Doc
Im your friend Tim

TIM
Then let me alone

He hands Doc the whiskey bottle

Doc
(jabbing at Macreedy
with a thumb)
Hes going to need you before the
night is over

He downs a snort then looks at Pete who approaches
them

Doc
(contemptuously)
And all the useful men are on the
other side

As Pete turns on the lamp behind Doc he reacts ever so
slightly to Docs words His almost imperceptible
grimace is
not lost on Macreedy Macreedy watches the young man as
he
continues to light the lamps

TIM
(angrily)
Lemme alone I tell ya

Doc slams the whiskey bottle down on a nearby table

Doc

I cant let you alone I cant let
myself alone Dont you understand
that

(he turns from Tim to

Pete who is unable

to shake his gaze

Then sadly fiercely)
Four years ago something terrible
happened here We did nothing about
it Nothing The whole town fell
into a sort of settled melancholy
and the people in it closed their
eyes and held their tongues and failed
the test with a whimper

Self-consciously Pete has backed off until now he leans

against the outside of the clerks desk But he still
cant

shut his ears to what Doc is saying

Doc

Now something terrible is going to
happen again and in a way were
lucky because weve been given a
second chance And this time I wont
close my eyes I wont hold my tongue
and if Im needed I wont fail

(almost harshly again

facing Tim)
And neither will you

Tim sighs running a thick hand over his forehead

TIM
I got such a headache Im bewildered
I hurt all over

MACREEDY
I know --
(unconsciously his
right arm strays to
massage the paralyzed

left)
-- pain is bewildering I came here
bewildered full of self-pity afraid
to fight back

(gesturing with his

hand to Pete)
And then your friend Smith tried to
kill me

(the muscles around

Petes mouth tighten)
Funny how a man clings to the earth
when he feels theres a chance he
may never see it again

Doc
Theres a difference between clinging
to the earth
(eyeing Tim almost
contemptuously)
»and crawling on it You going to
stand by and watch forever

TIM
(flatly)
I aint gonna watch and I aint
gonna get into it either

There is a moment of crashing silence Then

TIM
Im gettin out Im sorry Mr
Macreedy

Slowly he lumbers out of the lobby Doc watches him go
Again
the benumbing silence cut finally unexpectedly by

PETE
(to Doc)
Youd be smart to get out too

Doc
(angrily turning to
Pete)
Theres too many smart guys around
here Im glad Im a dummy

PETE
Youre a troublesome dummy Youre
liable to end up on your own slab
Doc
(heatedly)

I expect to be in a lot more trouble
before I die

PETE
Go home Doc
(he jerks his head
toward Macreedy and
with mock bravado)
Hes all washed up

MACREEDY
(grinning harshly at
him)
You think so

His right hand closes over the neck of the whiskey
bottle on

the end table Abstractedly fingering it he walks with
tense

deliberate steps toward Pete at the desk

MACREEDY
I was washed up when I got off that
train

He continues to advance inexorably toward Pete

PETE
(flatly)
You shouldn of got off

MACREEDY
Had to I had one last duty to perform
before I resigned from the human
race

Doc
(quizzically)
I thought you were going to Los
Angeles that hot-bed of pomp and
vanity Is that resigning from the
human race

MACREEDY
(shrugging)
LAs a good jumping off place --
for the Islands for Mexico Central
America

DOC
disturbed by

He is now

Why

MACREEDY
(again shrugs)
I dont know I was looking for a
place to get lost I guess

Doc
Why

MACREEDY

(slapping his paralyzed

arm with the whisky

bottle)
Because of this I thought Id never
be able to function again

(turning to Pete)
Thanks to your friend Smith I found
I was wrong

within a couple of yards of Pete

PETE
(drily)
Sure Youre a man of action

MACREEDY

(slowly)
I know your problem

(with mounting vigor)
Youd like me to die quickly without
wasting too much of your time

(Pete opens his mouth

to say something

but Macreedy presses

on)
or Silently without making you
feel too uncomfortable or

thankfully without making your
memories of the occasion too
unpleasant

For a moment Pete stares at Macreedy terribly

the incisiveness of Macreedys analysis Then

PETE
(bitterly)
My memories are so pleasant as it
is
the

turns

In sudden frustration Pete grabs the deck of cards on

clerks desk and slams them down hard They scatter

stares blankly between Doc and Macreedy

MACREEDY
(quietly pressing his
advantage)
What happened Pete

Pete doesnt answer

Doc

Are you going to tell him -- or you
want me to

(beat)
Smith owns Adobe Flat He leased it
to Komako -- thought he had cheated
him thought Komako could never even
run stock without water There was
never any water on Adobe Flat Komako
dug a well by hand He must have
went down one hundred and fifty feet

PETE
He got water plenty Smith was pretty
sore He didnt like Japs anyway

Doc
Thats an understatement

PETE
The day after Pearl Harbor Smith
went to Sand City

MACREEDY
(interrupting)
I know To enlist He was turned
down
PETE

He was sore when he got back About
ten oclock he started drinking

MACREEDY
Ten oclock in the morning

PETE
Yeah Hector joined him and Coley
Then Sam and about nine pm -- me

We were all drunk -- patriotic drunk

He
We went out to Komakos for a little
fun I guess -- scare him a little

MACREEDY
Did you know him

PETE
Wed seen him around some but none
of us knew him When he heard us
coming he locked the door Smith
started a fire The Jap came running
out His clothes were burning Smith
shot him I didnt even know Smith

had a gun

MACREEDY
Then you all got scared buried him
kept quiet

Pete nods helplessly bowing his head Macreedy sighs

looks
down at the bottle in his hand slowly puts it on the
table
MACREEDY
(softly)
Did Komako have any family besides
his son Joe
Doc
(puzzled)
His son Nobody around here knew
he had a son
MACREEDY
He had one But hes dead too Hes
buried in Italy
Doc
What are you doing here Mr Macreedy
MACREEDY
Joe Komako died in Italy saving my
life They gave him a medal I came
here to give it to his father

admission

He takes the bottle from the table and shakily pours a

glass of liquor As he raises it to his mouth

MACREEDY
(to Pete harshly
guttural)

Itll take a lot of whiskey to wash
out your guts

hypnotized by Macreedys voice as hard and as c

eyes

MACREEDY
-And it will never help -- not
even a barrel full washes away murder

Macreedys hand shoots out in a short inexorab
smashing his palm across the shot glass The whiskey

in a spray the glass flies halfway across the r
shattering as it lands against something solid

stunned

at him

Doc perplexed at Macreedys violence

Macreedys eyes are murky The creases between t

over his nose are deep His nostrils move in and out

uneasiness Rage comes into Macreedys face tur

painful red

MACREEDY

But maybe Im wrong Go on -- drink

(scornfully)
What else is left for you

(mounting anger)
Youre as dead as Komako only you
dont know it

(roaring)
You also dont know that its not
enough to feel guilty Its not enough

ing
ning it
to confess Its not enough to say
Forgive me Ive done wrong

boc
Take it easy Macreedy Sit down

MACREEDY
(turning on him)
Sit down Or would you rather have
me kneel to beg his pardon for
raising a touchy subject

Pete squirms under Macreedys relentless attack

PETE
(shaking his head)
You dont have to remind me Ive
never forgotten

MACREEDY
Well thats mighty noble of you
You feel ashamed -- thats noble

too

(in mounting crescendo)
And four years from now youll
probably be sitting here telling
somebody else you havent forgotten
me Thats progress -- youll still
be ashamed but Ill be dead

Macreedy grabs the bottle shoving it across the table

toward
Pete
MACREEDY
Go on have your drink
(with exorbitant scorn)
You need it
Pete pushes the bottle aside too ravaged by Macreedys
words
and his own thoughts to drink He shakes his head
grimly and
then with sudden decision goes to the switchboard and
plugs

in a line

staring at him)

relief Macreedy frowns thoughtfully He strains to

of her words over the wire

Again Lizs voice incoherent over the phone and

Slowly he replaces the phone on the switch-board He

around from behind the desk

interrupting)

left any more but however little it
is I wont waste it

briefly then)

she gives voice to her fantasy

Not with muscle

LIZ
And not with brains either Hes a

Nope But I sure thought the situation
