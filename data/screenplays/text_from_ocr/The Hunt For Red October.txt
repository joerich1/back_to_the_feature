RYAN

Gentlemen the last twenty four hours
have seen some extraordinary Soviet
naval activity The first to sail was —

(slide)
this ship the Red October A variant
of the typhoon class shes some six
hundred fifty feet long Thirty-two
thousand tons submerged displacement
roughly the size of a World War IT
aircraft carrier

(beat)
Unlike the standard typhoon equipped
to fire long-range missiles from Russian
waters Red October carries fifty-six
S-3is which is a short-range attack
missile with eight independent warheads
Thats four hundred forty-eight warheads
all specifically designed to fire close in

(another slide)
We believe these doors on the bow and
here again on the stern enclose a
magneto-hydrodynamic drive or caterpillar
which may allow the sub to run totally

(anether slide)
It is possible this new drive system

allowed the Captain a man named Marko
Ramius —

Ryan paints out two photos on a bulletin board One is of Ramius
The other is a wedding photo of Ramius and a beautiful

RYAN (CONTD)
— to elude one of our attack boats
the Dallas which trailed Red October
from harbor this morning

(pointedly)
This drive if its working could
render Red October invisible to cur

i “SOSUS warning nets in the Atlantic

PELT
You would characterize this as a first
strike weapon Dr Ryan

Ryan glances at Greer Greer smiles reassuringly

RYAN
Theres no doubt about that sir She
is designed to approach by stealth and
fire on a target with little or no warning

-37-

ADMIRAL
An offensive weapon The kind you start
wars with

RYAN
Precisely Admiral

(re map)
If I may continue Shortly after the
Dallas lost contact there were additional
Soviet sailings from Polijarny Leningrad
and the Mediterranean The Soviets have
some -—

(checking notes)
fifty-eight nuclear submarines headed at
high speed into the Atlantic And this
afternoons satellite pass over Palijarny
found head blooms in the engineering plants
of the Kirov the Minsk and more than
twenty cruisers and destroyers indicating
that the bulk of their surface fleet is
also preparing to sail

Flushed Ryan sits beside Greer Pelt turns to Greer

PELT
Conclusions

GREER
Absence of activity in the Pacific suggest
this is probably just an exercise having
nething to do with the Red October

A General starts to object Hes cut off by JUDGE MOORE a
white-haired civilian near the top of the table

MOORE
NSA can speak to that Mr Pelt
egies PELT
Judge
MOORE

- Imust emphasize the extremé’ sensitivity
- Of this information and ask that on no
account it leave this room
(Pelt nods)
Before sailing Captain Ramius sent a
letter to Admiral Yuri Padorin Chairman
of Soviet Naval Deployment

Painting at Ramius wedding picture Ryan whispers to Greer

’

RYAN
Thats her uncle

-38

GREER
Whose uncle

RYAN
(whispering)
Ramius wife Padorins her uncle

Greer has no idea what Ryans saying Moores still talking

MOORE

The contents of the letter are unknown
but Admiral Padorin immediately demanded
a meeting with Premier Ligachev and
within minutes of that meeting the
Soviet Fleet sailed with orders to find
Red October --

(pause)
And sink her —-

Audible intake of breath round the room Pelt is the first to
recover

PELT
Sink her

ADMIRAL
My god Theyve got a madman on
their hands Hes gonna start a war
A spirited discussion ensues Tuning it out Ryan stares at the
picture of Ramius and his wife Urgently he whispers to Greer

RYAN
This is the twenty-third isnt it

Greer nods Order in the room has broken down Generals and
Admirals argue vehemently about appropriateresponses Staring at
the photos a une goes off in Ryans brain

RYAN
You son of a hitch

Ryan realizes everyone in the room is staring at him

PELT
(dryly)
Youve something to add to the
ion Dr Ryan

RYAN
UhhnnI was just thinking there
was perhaps ancther possibility we
ought to consider

Ryan takes a deep breath

RYAN (CONTD)
Ramius might be trying to defect

Nobody moves Ryan glances at Greer Greer rds his eyes Too
far out Ryans on his own The General bristles

Do you mean to suggest ——

men willing to help him And hes net

who was a fisherman He has no children

Oh come on Look what are you daing

(to Greer)

Thats his name isnt Ryan

(turning)
Youre just an analyst right You
cant possibly know --

RYAN
I know Ramius General Hes been a
maverick for his entire career I even
net him once at an embassy dinner

Qevel)
Have you ever met Captain Ramius sir
The General darkens Making a decision Pelt turns to the Admiral

PELT
Bottom line how long before Ramius will
be in a position to launch his missiles
at us

ADMIRAL
Four days

PELT
Alright Ill brief the President
That will be all gentlemen

Dr Ryan Would you stay for a
moment please

Everyone gets up to leave As Greer rises he winks at Ryan

GREER
I said speak your mind Jack but
Jesus —

Shaking his head Greer pats Ryans shoulder and leaves Ryans
mouth is dry Pelt gets up

PELT
You slammed the door on the General
pretty hard Jack

RYAN
Tt wasnt my intention sir —

PELT

(grinning)
Yes it was He was patronizing you
and you stomped on him In my
opinion he deserved it

(beat)
Look Im a politician Jack That
means Im a liar a cheat and when
Im not kissing babies Im stealing
their lollipops But it also means
I know people and keep my options open

(beat)
Lets assume for a minute that youre
right and he intends to defect What
do you think we should do

RYAN

Wen ‘somebody has to go out and try— -
to contact him

PELT
OK When can you leave

RYAN
(flushed)
Wait a minute The General was right
Im just an analyst -

41-

PELT
Perfect I cant ask any of these
characters to go None of them would
volunteer putting their reputations
on the line And anyway none of
them are expendable

TQ give you three days to prove
your theory after that we wont
have any chaice but to hunt Ramius

may have something here

MANCUSO
Go ahead

Ive been working on a sound I heard
when the typhoon disappeared I washed
it through the tape machine several times
and managed to isolate it But when I
asked the computer to identify it the
answer I got was magma displacement

MANCUSO
Magma displacement

Yes sir See the system we are
using was originally designed to look
for seismic events and although we ”
dapted it to hunt for submarines

MANCUSO
ut tothe chase Jonesy

Aye aye sir AnywayI got curious
and started tracking the sound on our)
lateral array I located it four Be
different times The fifth time it

was gone and I couldnt find it But

I want to show you what I worked up

Picking up a grease pencil Jones makes calculations on the status
board overlaying the nautical map

48-

JONES (CONTD)

The first contact was at zero-nine-fifteen
hours and the bearing was two-six-nine

(drawing line)
Then at zero-nine-thirty hours it was
bearing two-six-zero And at zero-nine-
forty-eight is was two-five-zero

(another line)
I came back to it at about ten-hundred
and the bearing was two-four-two The
last signal was real faint and I didnt
have a very good lock on it

MANCUSO
So

JONES
Well I figure it couldnt be very far
away from us right Lets say it was
halfway between us and Iceland That
would put it on a course like this

Jones makes more calculations on the status board Mancuso
recognizes a pattern

MANCUSO
Headed directly into Red Route One

JONES
Exactly Sir I believe the sound I
heard is the acoustical signature of some
kind of super-quiet Russian submarine and
hes taking the inshore track off the
Iceland coast

THOMPSON
What do you think Captain

stares the status board then turns to Jones

MANCUSO

Let me see if I got this straight The
three million dollar computer tells you
‘youre chasing after an earthquake and
you arent convinced So you get curious

Soviet sailor with crazy eyes

ITS LOGINOV

the cooks assistant who witnessed the Putin key exchange Hes
got a hot wire in each hand Time stands still Ryan stares at
Loginov Loginov stares back

Theres something in the Loginovs eyes an uncompromising
irrational villainy that asks no forgiveness For a moment Ryans
paralyzed a rabbit before a cobra

Deliberately Loginov begins to move his hands together bringing
the wires closer Ryan tries to speak He cant Loginovs grin
cracks wide like a rotten egg

RYAN FIRES

Flame LEAPS from the BARREL of the 45 The pistal KICKS like a
MULE Loginov is delivered to eternity Impotent the wires fall to
the floor

IN THE WATER

Blinding light The Konovalov disintegrates Billowing pockets of
gas embrace the deep Thirty-seven hundred tons of steel and iron
rip apart in the blink of an eye

ON THE SURFACE

a white mountain of displaced water rises into the air compresses
and explodes
ON THE FRIGATE

in shock the Russian crew gapes at the explosion The young
sailor who took courage from Ramius makes the sign of the cross

ON RED OCTOBER

in the Conn as the aftershock subsides Ryan helps Ramius up off
the floor trying to make him comfortable against a bulkhead

RAMIUS
Captain Tupelev has just provided your
pantomine with the one thing you could
never have managed

RYAN
(nodding)
Wreckage

CUT TO
PELT
in his office seated across from Lysenko

PELT
With the depth of the water and the
wreckage scattered over such a wide
area it will be a long time before
anything is recovered Your people
are already interviewing the crew and
making arrangements for their return
‘ (Lysenko nods
soberly)
This has been a terrible tragedy Mr
Ambassador I can only stress that if
youd come to us earlier it might have

been avaided
him
LYSENKO
T appreciate your candor in the matter
PELT
(smoothly)
And I yours Andrel
LYSENKO
(probing)

Perhaps in the future the techndlogy
will be available for a more thorough
investigation of the wreckage
PELT
(steady)
Perhaps

A long beat as the two men stare at each other Lysenko finally
breaks it off

LYSENKO
There is another matterOne I am
reluctant to —

PELT

No Please go ahead

LYSENKO
One of our submarines an Akula was
last reported in the Reykjanes Ridge
’ We have not heard from her for sometime

Pelt stares at him blankly time hangs suspended Finally Pelt
reaches for the bridge of his nose as if to stave of a killer
headache

PELT
Youve lost another submarine
(beat)
Andrei ‘

Lysenko sits hatin hand Finally he averts his gaze

JUMP CUT TO
A DRIVER
standing beside a limousine outside the Executive Office Building
Fuming Lysenko approaches The driver smiles Not a good idea
Lysenko snaris

eS LYSENKO

4 shut up Dont speak to me Boris Dont
ver speak to me unless I speak to you

first And wipe that smile off your face

Lysenko piles into the limo slamming the door as hard as he can
Locked inside he starts shouting and hitting things

THE RED OCTOBER

glides quietly up the rivers surface Ramius and Ryan stand on
the sail Behind them two junior officers one American and one
Russian conn the ship

RYAN
Were two hundred miles from the nearest
naval base

RAMIUS
Interesting notion hiding a submarine
in a river
(eyeing shore)
How do you know this place

RYAN
I grew up not far from here
(painting)
My grandfather taught me to fish right
over there on that rock

Ramius spots a large rock on the shore So warm and inviting this
land when compared to the bitter cold coast he left a lifetime ago
Ramius studies Ryan in the stillness

RAMIUS
There is one question you have not
asked me

RYAN
Why
(Ramus nods)
I assumed you would speak when you were
ready

RAMIUS
us We are standing on part of the reason
Ive spent my life preparing to fight a
war I hoped would never happen This
ship was not built to fight such a war
It was built to start one

(beat)
And there were personal reasons

RYAN
Your wife

RAMIUS
(nodding)
It started there perhaps
-113-

Ramius glances at the rock Beside it a muskrat drops quietly into
the water

RAMIUS (CONTD)
Or perhaps it was something that started

long ago

RYAN
Fishing

RAMIUS
Fishing

Taking a deep breath Ramius studies the surrounding hills Lights
from farms twinkle in the night air

RAMIUS (CONTD)
The sea will grant each man new
hope as sleep doth dream of home
