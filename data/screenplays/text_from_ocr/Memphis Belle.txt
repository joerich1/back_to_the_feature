EXT FIELD - DAY

A football game is in progress Six guys on each side
all in their late teens and early twenties wearing
khaki pants work shirts T-shirts OVER we hear the
voice of BRUCE DERRINGER The first player we see is
VIRGH HOOGESTEGER

BRUCE (V0)
Virge Hoogesteger What kind of
name is that Nicknamed The
Virgin Well look at him Poor
kid probably tries to get a girl
into bed and she wants to make him
brush his teeth and wash behind
his ears

Then we see JACK BOCCI bulldozing down one of the
defense players

BRUCE (V0)
Look at this goon Jack Bocci
from Brooklyn Hes a magician
Wants to be the next Houdini
Well hes escaped twenty-four
missions Not bad for an amateur

Next EUGENE McVEY nervously making a play

BRUCE (V0)
This is the religious one
Theres always a religious one
Eugene McVey Nineteen from
Cleveland Theres always one
from Cleveland High strung
nervous always coming down with
something Howd he get in this
bunch

Next we see RICHARD RASCAL MOORE showing off

BRUCE (V0)
Rascal That cant be his real
name Here we go Richard Moore
but called the Rascal Thinks
hes a real ladies man Talks
dirty the whole bit Well hell
grow out of it If he grows at all

Then we see CLAY BUSBY cooly running with the ball
( )
1A

BRUCE (V0)
Clay Busby a farmers son from
Louisiana Plays piano and sings
Listen to this Learned piano in
a New Orleans whorehouse Better
keep that out of the papers

Last we see DANNY DALY He has the ball and is going
for the touchdown as his team urges him on

BRUCE (V0)
Oh boy this kid couldnt be more
Irish if he tried Even his name
Danny Daly Hes the
intellectual Writes poetry
Likes to read Hates sports

Danny makes the touchdown He shouts with exhilaration
and raises the ball in triumph Just then a huge olive
drab B-17 bomber appears out of nowhere and roars
directly overhead The game is forgotten and everyone
starts running towards a short boxy control tower Now
we see that the football field is a grassy area on the
side of an air field with three intersecting runways

Men are coming from all over the base on foot and
bicycle shouting out the number of planes five seven
nine twelve Planes are appearing all over the sky

EUGENE
Fifteen sixteen

JACK
How many went out

DANNY
Twenty-one

VIRGE

We MOVE UP TO the control tower The balcony is crowded
with men THROUGH the window we see the CO (Commanding
Officer) on the phone

INT CONTROL TOWER - DAY

The CO is in his early thirties impeccably-dressed
Hes in charge and handles his many responsibilities
efficiently -- no detail is too small In the bg are
the adjutant and other personnel

1A

co
Sir theyre still coming in
How can I promise you 24 planes
tomorrow when theyre not even
back

The adjutant comes up to him with some papers the CO
grabs them and motions the adjutant away The CO is
shocked by what he hears He speaks quietly

co
Where But we hit that target a
month ago sir I thought

The voice on the other end interrupts

co
I know we have to put the pressure
on but I almost lost a quarter of

my

The 8-2 a scholarly bespectacled young man comes in
from the balcony and waits to get the COs attention
Frustrated exasperated the CO listens to the voice on
the other end

co

Yes sir Yes sir Ill have my
ground crews work all night I
was hoping to give them a little
break Were having a dance

first anniversary

(interrupted again)
Yes Ill give you an update as

He hangs up Hes shaken by the news hes received

8-2
Sir eighteen planes Three still
out

He nods then hurries out the door to the balcony
EXT CONTROL TOWER BALCONY - DAY

On the balcony COLONEL BRUCE DERRINGER Bruce is in
his mid-thirties has all-American good looks and an
easy-going charm that he can turn on and off at will
Bruce isnt watching the planes landing Hes looking
down at the lawn below The CO comes out on the balcony
with the 8-2

( )

BRUCE

co
Those are the enlisted men

BRUCE

sons of bitches in the world

co
Theyre ordinary men Bruce

2A BRUCES POV

FROM the balcony DOWN TO the control tower lawn where
our six boys are just joining the crowd below

BRUCE (0S)

volunteer for this then they
do 24 missions without a scratch
They dont sound very ordinary

to me
5-2

2B EXT CONTROL TOWER BALCONY - DAY

The CO looks out at arriving planes through his
binoculars

BRUCE
You know people at home are

win this war

BRUCE
Youre right and weve got to

EXT BASE - DAY

The plane is coming in to land It has two feathered
props and only the left front wheel is down The wheel
touches the runway and the plane immediately tips to

the right It pivots on its single wheel scraping its
belly on the runway The props on the right side bend
back slowing the PLANEs spin It starts to come to

a halt but just as it looks like its safe it EXPLODES
in a sudden fiery blast

EXT CONTROL TOWER LAWN - DAY

The six boys recoil with shock and disbelief Danny
watches as long as he can then turns away -- he
cant stand it anymore

EXT CONTROL TOWER BALCONY - DAY

Bruce is also looking at the burning plane with horror
The CO is stony-faced He shows no surprise and little
emotion -- hes seen it too often before

co
Come on Bruce you wanted to meet
the officers of the Southern
Belle

BRUCE
Jesus what happened They were
almost home

co
Almost The pilot came in on one
wheel He should have belly

EXT BASE - NIGHT

Its dark foggy Dennis walks across the field toward
another hangar a beer in his hand The BAND can be
heard in the DISTANCE

INT SECOND HANGAR - NIGHT

It is brightly starkly lit with floodlights There are
planes and parts of planes crowded in here with ground
crews crawling over them It is an epic sight showing
the huge scale of the air war and the number of men
required to sustain it In the fg is a plane Is You
Is Or Is You Aint My Baby The pilots window is
shattered a front tire is flat a chunk has been taken
out of the tail the ball turret is broken in half and

Les turns back to work A moment Dennis knows he
jumped on Les a little too fast but he also doesnt
want to apologize He turns and goes out the door

EXT MEMPHIS BELLE - NIGHT
We see only the vague outline of the Belle through the

fog as Dennis approaches He stops in front of the nose
and speaks to the plane

DENNIS
Well Im going to miss you girl

You know how to take care of your
man and thats just about the best
thing a fellow can say about a
girl I guess Maybe well be

but it wont be the same will it
It wont have the same

He searches for the word cant find it then starts to
take a drink But he decides hes had enough and pours
the rest of the beer on the ground He turns and walks
back across the field to the dance Then a head pops up
and looks out through the nose of the plane Virge

FAITH (0S)
I wish youd talk to me like that
Virge

18 INT NOSE - NIGHT

Looking forward we see Virge and Faith in silhouette
Theyve put something down on the floor of the plane as
a makeshift bed perhaps some parachutes

unhappily watching Bruce The Rookie starts to complete
the cheer

ROOKIE
Hooray

Danny grabs his arm to stop him A couple of other
rookies have started to cheer but they also quickly shut
up A grim silence falls over the hangar Bruce is
embarrassed and doesnt know what to do Danny looks at
Clay -- a look saying Do something Clay quickly goes
through the crowd and steps up onstage and takes the
microphone

CLAY
This buddy of mine keeps begging
me to sing and I guess I aint
gonna get out of it this time

Clay says a few words to the band leader then turns back
to the microphone In the meantime Bruce quietly leaves
the stage The band begins

He blushes and tries to escape Jack and Eugene grab
Danny and force him to stay The Rookie smiles enjoying
this -- this is what Danny was talking about

bottle of Scotch He looks up at the moon diffused
through a layer of fog He shouts

His call fades away He takes a long drink from the
bottle He stumles a little then wanders off disap-
pearing into the fog

reflect the bright sunrise Its a B-17F olive green
with a grey belly On the nose theres a painting of

a leggy woman in a bathing suit Also twenty-four
yellow bomb emblems and eight swastikas The big forward
landing gear gives it a wide stance and the nose points
into the air as if eager to take off The plane is
huge so huge it doesnt look like it could ever get off
the ground Its a dramatic sight the sun coming up
yellow and hot behind this 30 tons of machine Men are
feverishly working on the plane getting it ready load-
ing the bombs checking every detail again and again

Everything is crossed out He turns a page or two Same
thing everything is crossed out

ON DANNY

Everyone is watching him He looks down at the book and
pretends to read He starts nervously

DANNY
I know that I shall meet my fate
Somewhere among the clouds above
Those that I fight I do not hate
Those that I guard I do not
love

He hesitates Theyre listening Its very quiet just
the harmonica Danny recites from memory

DANNY
Nor law nor duty bade me fight
Nor public men nor cheering
crowds
A lonely impulse of delight
Drove to this tumult in the

clouds

I balanced all brought all to
mind

The years to come seemed waste of
breath

A waste of breath the years behind
In balance with this life this
death

Long long silence The words have expressed the feel-
ings of each of these men the attraction to the fight
and the fear of it the threat of death and the excite-
ment of its closeness We FOCUS ON Dennis -- hes
particularly struck by the poem This is a moment
suspended in time -- then its abruptly broken when the
JHEP races up SKIDS to a halt and the Lieutenant yells
to Dennis

falls hard to the floor The other PLANE ROARS directly

Rascal is curled into the womb-like turret His legs are
spread and his feet are set on pedals which control the
movement of the turret There are small windows on each
side and one large circular window of armored glass in
front He has no room at all Its claustrophobic

At the same time the turret is insubstantial as if
Rascal werent in the plane at all just tenuously
clinging to its belly He presses the foot pedals
spinning the turret around testing it

ahead of the second In our squadron the first flight
is Windy City Mamas Boys and C Cup Memphis Belle is
the lead plane of the second flight with Baby Ruth and
Mother and Country as its left and right wingmen

136 EXT MEMPHIS BELLE

P-47 Thunderbolts streak across the sky above the
formation like fat hummingbirds Theyre careful not
to point their noses at or fly directly into the for-
mation to avoid being mistaken for enemy aircraft
These one-seat fighters have a single propeller mounted
in a round blunt nose with a white ring around the
cowling They have eight machine gun barrels four

on each wing They zoom effortlessly through the air
at 300 mph and can perform dazzling acrobatics

FATHER (V0)
Dear Colonel Harriman I want to
thank you for your letter of
sympathy about my son Tommy He
was only at your base a month
but he must have made a big
impression because you described
him right down to his boots I
wish you could have told me how
Tommy died but I understand we
have to be careful about security
these days Im glad he was brave
and did his job to the end Maybe
his mother and I raised him right
after all 1 guess well get
used to him being gone but not
too soon I hope Well I can
always read your letter and that
will bring him back Sincerely
Thomas R Maguire
