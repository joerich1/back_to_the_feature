THE STING PART II
THATS WHY THE LADY IS A TRAMP

FADE IN
EXT ATLANTIC CITY NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

Its a balmy night in August 1940 We open on the exterior
of a swank Atlantic City nightclub its dazzling facade
illuminating a passing parade of hipsters which stops like
a freeze dance every time the club door opens and allows a
few bars of the music within to escape Its the dream of
every hipster that a party of fifteen will come out keeping
the door open long enough perhaps to hear Ziggy Elmans
entire trumpet solo on Body and Soul

ANOTHER ANGLE

This time however only a couple emerges accompanied at
best by a few diminished eighth notes The man elegantly
dressed and refined in manner is immediately recognizable
as Kid Twist the bogus telegraph operator in The Sting
On his arm is a statuesque blonde in clinging crepe T ey
proceed to a cab and slide in the back

INT CAB

As Twist leans forward to give instructions to the cabbie
he fails to notice that the woman slides right out the other
side He turns to find that her place has been taken by a
huge hulk of a man who says nothing and stares straight
ahead Twist has seen that look before and moves to get out
the way he cam in only to find that there is now a thug on
the other side of him too This one closes the door beside
him and assumes the same pose as his friend Twist realizes
that hes in trouble The cabbie pulls out with no word
from the thugs It doesnt matter He knows better than
they do where theyre going

curt TO
INT A DOWNTOWN HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

The camera moves in slowly on a man sitting alone in the
dark his head partially illuminated by the lights from the
amusement park across the street The only sound in the
room comes from an unseen fan The camera stops when were
close enough to realize that the man is Doyle Lonnegan the
gangstermark of The Sting His eyes are set and far off

00406 2

his face lost in thought A knock is heard at the door
and Lonnegan jumps a bit as if someone had just snuck w
on him We hear a voice outside Its Floyd Lonnegans
right-hand man

FLOYD
Doyle Homers downstairs They
made a clean snatch on Twist You
want us to dump him

LONNEGAN
No bring him here I wanta see
him first
FLOYD
Okay

(noticing that
theres no light
coming under
the door)

You all right in there

LONNEGAN
Im all right

INT HOTEL CORRIDOR

as Floyd walks on down the hall

INT LONNEGANS HOTEL ROOM
Lonnegan slips back into his reverie The camera starts to

move in on him again We burn into his eyes which never
blink despite the play of the neon across them

We hear A sound montage of the replay of the last few
minutes of The Sting”

1 The voice of Lonnegan placing his half million dollar
bet with great bravado the call of a race in the bg

2 Kid Twist telling Lonnegan that hes bet incorrectly
and will lose all his money

3 Lonnegan trying frantically almost hysterically to get
his money back from the cashier

00406 3

4 A fusilade of gun shots

5 The voice of Detective Snyder urging Lonnegan out of the
betting parlor

Again a knock is heard at the door

LONNEGAN
Come in

The door opens to reveal Twist and his two captors sil-
houetted in the doorway Lonnegan reaches out and turns

on a light and for the first time we are able to see the
room It looks like an expensive suite in any luxury hotel
except that the walls are covered with photographs 8 x 10
blowups of every single man involved in the con of Lonnegan
some four years before Prominently displayed above the
others like the leaders of some Eastern European politburo
are shots of Gondroff and Hooker

Lonnegan allows Twist to take in the room before he speaks
Twist tries heard not to notice the photographs

LONNEGAN
What do you think of my pictures
Twist

TWIST

My names not Twist and I dont
know much about pictures

LONNEGAN
You find yours yet

TwIST
I dont know why a picture of me
would be up there

LONNEGAN
(without taking
his eyes off
Twist
On the wall to your left Fourth
one from the right Between Curly
Jackson and JJ Singleton

Twist doesnt bother to look at the photograph He knows
its there
LONNEGAN
I coulda picked somebody else I
know where most of them are now
You just happened to be the closest

00406 4

2
TWIST
I got no idea what youre talkin
about I dont know any of these
people

LONNEGAN
Four years ago forty-seven months
and six days to be exact you helped
them take me for half a million dol-
lars I should think youd remember
at

TWIST
Look you got me mixed up with
somebody else I

LONNEGAN

(not even

listening to
Twist)
You played the telegraph operator
the guy who held up the race results
Ill never forget when you came in
and told me Id screwed up the bet
Acting like it was the end of the
world when inside you had to be
jumping up and down Gondorff musta
been proud of you Twist I wish
you could remember it I had hoped
1t would have meant more to you to
take a man like me

(offerin

his hand
I can only congratulate you on a
job beautifully done

Lonnegan has attempted to deliver all this with a no hard
feelings attitude but Twist is not fooled He knows there
wilt be no reprieve for him He decides to go out like a
champ

TWIST
Believe me Lonnegan it was the
greatest day of my life

cur TO
EXT RIVER FRONT - NIGHT

Lonnegan and Floyd are sitting in a car looking out over

the river to a warehouse on the other side All the lights
are out in the warehouse except for one on the second story
at the top of a fifty-foot-long loading chute which runs
from the second floor out over the water It is normally
used to convey cargo from the warehouse to freight barges

00406 5

below Lonnegan and Floyd have their eyes glued to it
expecting something to happen there soon Floyd in par-
ticular seems to be anxious

INT LONNEGANS CAR

FLOYD
You shouldnt be here Doyle

LONNEGAN
Get the word out that Macalinski
put Kid Twist with the fishes

A body feet encased in concrete goes speeding down the
loading chute and disappears below the surface of the black
water

LONNEGAN
Thats one

With a gesture to Floyd Lonnegan sits back grimly and
the car moves off

Main title and opening credits

EXT JOHNNY HOOKERS APARTMENT BUILDING - EARLY EVENING

We pick up Johnny Hooker washing himself in a makeshift
shower that hes rigged up on the fire escape of his one
room apartment He uses old bed sheets for a curtain and
his shower head consists ofa comb taped over the end of

a garden hose which runs in through the window to a faucet
on the small sink which occupies one corner of his totally
undistinguished room

Hooker is obviously in an expansive mood as he sings along
to the radio which hes hung on the landing above him
Its playing Helen Wards version of “Goody Goody with the
Benny Goodman orchestra His rinse water meanwhile drips
through the grating of the fire escape to the pavement six
floors below watering several window boxes on the way
Hooker finishes up and climbs back through his window

INT HOOKERS APARTMENT
As hes toweling off the Eirie Kid enters the room

HOOKER

Eirie is interrupted by a knock at the door

ANOTHER ANGLE

Hooker goes to answer it half-dressed in a pair of socks

00406 8

with knee suspenders and green shorts with the letters YMCA
on them Its a Deliveryman with a tuxedo in his hand

DELIVERYMAN

HOOKER

a dollar bill)

DELIVERYMAN

out the door

Hooker turns back to Eirie and begins to putting on his tux

HOOKER

As Hooker dials his call we
CUT TO
INT THE MARINE ROOM OF THE STEEL PIER - NIGHT 11

One of the great ballrooms of the era in a class with the
Roseland in New York and the Aragon and Trianon in Chicago
Featuring an ocean of hardwood dance floor divided here
and there into inlets and bays by the arrangements of the
tables the Marine was a must play date for all the big
swing bands of the forties Not as elegant certainly as
the supper clubs but more exciting

The bands female vocalist is just getting into You Turned
The Tables On Me as Hooker and Eirie enter the ballroom

EIRIE
Shes at table sixteen on the left
toward the front

HOOKERS POINT OF VIEW - TABLE SIXTEEN 12

Hookers eyes search the floor and finally come to rest on
table sixteen Hes not quite ready for what he finds
there He had expected the Woman to be rich but he hadnt
expected her to be beautiful Regal in bearing she has
the untouchable beauty of a Hedy Lamarr The kind that
turns passing strangers into employees Hookers first
instinct is to turn around and go home He has barely
noticed the Older Woman toher left who is plainly dressed
and exudes a professional protectiveness toward her com-
panion

HOOKER AND EIRIE 12-A

EIRIE
Whatd I tell ya huh If she aint
loaded with jack I dont know my
own name

12-A

00406 10

HOOKER

I dont feel right about this Eirie
- I mean shes with her mother and

everything

EIRIE
Look this is no slight on her
She happens to be keepin company
with some cash Its not like you
hate the dame Someday when youre
a millionaire you can buy her a
bracelet or somethin

HOOKER
Hell we dont even have any props
with us What are we gonna take
her on

Eirie was prepared for this He takes out an envelope con-
taining a stack of fake money and another one containing
paper cut up the size of dollar bills

EIRIE
I got the boodle and the stiff right
here All we gotta do is back it
with some real green and we got
everything we need How muc
cash you got

HOOKER
Fifteen bucks

EIRIE
I got twenty Well put mine on
top and yours on the bottom It
aint great but its good enough

Eirie puts the twenty on the top of the false bankroll
and the ten on the bottom

EIRIE
Your problem is youre lettin her
looks go to your head Since when
have you ever gotten to first base
with a dame like that These society
types think theyre too good for
regular people She wouldnt be
seen outside a barnyard with either
one of us

This is a very telling point with Hooker His heart be-
gins to harden against the Woman

12-A
00406 il

12-A - 2 12-A

HOOKER
Youre right Eirie That kinda
babe gives me the pip

Shot through with new motivation Hooker looks at the
Woman like shes a barbell to be cleaned and jerked Hes
a complete professional now He takes off his watch and
hands it to Eirie then snatches a flower out of a vase
and puts it in his lapel We follow him as he makes his
way over to table sixteen

13 AT TABLE SIXTEEN 13
Hooker immediately affects the demeanor of an entrepeneur

HOOKER
Excuse me ladies You havent by
chance seen a gold watch around
here have you

WOMAN
(through a
thick French
accent)
No I do not think so Mr

HOOKER
Stewart Charles Stewart Im the
‘ manager here

WOMAN
Pleased to meet you Mr Stewart
I am Veronique LeFleur and

OLDER WOMAN
(interrupting)
The Countess Veronique Fabian LeFleur

VERONIQUE

(slightly

embarrassed)
Giselle they do not care about these
things in America

(to Hooker)
This is my maid servant Giselle
Duvillard We are sorry that you
lost your watch

HOOKER

Oh it wasnt mine Miss LeFleur
GISELLE

Countess LeFleur
VERONIQUE

Giselle

00406 12

HOOKER

A Mr Jerome Hawthorne lost it in
here tonight and is quite anxious
to get it back Its an Elgin
Special with a monogrammed JH on

e back Hes offering a thousand
dollar reward for its return

VERONIQUE
(honestl
relieved
Oh then its not an expensive one

Hooker struggles to maintain his nonchalance in the face of
such a remark Its a hard one for a poor boy to swallow
He looks for some indication that she may be kidding He
doesnt get one

HOOKER

Well it was just that it was very

personal to Mr Hawthorne It was
given to him by his father just be-
ore he was killed in the Battle
of Belaue Wood

VERONIQUE
(truly moved)
Oh how sad If we find it we
will bring it to you how do you
sayon the double

14 ANGLE
Both women permit themselves a little laugh at their mastery
of this English idiom
HOOKER
(taking his
leave
Thank you Miss LeFleur
GISELLE
(sullenly)

Countess LeFleur

15 ON HOOKER

We follow him as he returns to Eirie out of sight of the
two women

HOOKER
You were right Eirie Moneys
nothin to her Shes a countess

00406 13

15
HOOKER (Contd)
French Not a bad egg for a coun-
tess Maybe in France theyre not
so snot-nosed

Its obvious that Veroniques charm has rekindled some
second thoughts in Hooker

EIRIE
Aw cmon Underneath theyre all
alike Youre not softening up
on me are ya Hooker

ON EIRIE 16

This time we follow Eirie as he makes his way to the table
He boldly Rieg himself down right next to Veronique in the
booth talking to her in a conspiritorial fashion out of
the side of his mouth

EIRIE

Look lady I know you dont know
me but I need a little help The
Manager heres got it in for me
and Id appreciate it if you could
pretend like we was friends and
everything Like we been sittin’
here for a Long time havin a

- nice evening

ANGLE 17

as Hooker suddenly appears at the table Eirie pretends to
be carrying ona conversation with the woman who doesnt
know what to make of him

HOOKER
(to Eirie)
Fisher I thought I told you to stay
outta here
EIRIE

Its a free country Stewart A
man can dance if he wants to

(to the

Countess)
Me and my date was just about to
cut up the rug a little wasnt we
honey

The Countess doesnt know what to say She has no idea
what Eirie is talking about

HOOKER
Stand up and empty out your pockets

00406 14

Eirie hesitates a second then stands up and reluctantly
empties out his pockets He shows nothing but a wallet
and a pair of keys

EIRIE
See Im clean

HOOKER
Good then you wont have anything
to weigh you down on the way out
Or do I have to call the police

EIRIE
(deciding its
time to leave)
All right all right I didnt want
to hang out in this dive anyway

Eirie beats a speedy retreat

VERONIQUE
Who was that man

HOOKER -
Oh hes a cheap crook A pickpocket
a fence you name it

ANOTHER ANGLE

Both women are visibly frightened to have been in the pre-
sence of such a man Veronique glances down at where Eirie
was sitting and something catches her eye -- theres a gold
watch on the seat She picks it up quickly and hands it to
Hooker

VERONI

QUE
Mr Stewart theres a watch here
I think its your friends

HOOKER

(inspecting

the watch)
Its Hawthornes all right Fisher
probably stole it from him and took
it out of his pocket when I asked
to search him

The women are really scared now

GISELLE
Arent you going to call the police

00406 15

HOOKER
Wouldnt do any good unless we had
found the watch on him Whatever
you found the watch You have a
reward coming

VERONIQUE
Oh but I could not take it I have
done nothing to deserve it

HOOKER
I insist Mr Hawthorne will be very
unhappy with me if I dont follow
his instructions You found the
watch The money is yours Please
he will be most insulted if you turn

it down
VERONIQUE
(resigned)
All right I do not wish to offend
the man

(to Giselle)
When in America I suppose we must
do as the Americans

HOOKER

hands her the envelope with the boodle in it She puts
it in her purse without even bothering to check it

HOOKER

Excuse me but if I may be so bold
I wouldnt carry that money in your
purse Not in a neighborhood like
this You walk down the street with
a purse in plain view youre gonna
lose it There are twenty other
thieves outside just like Fisher
only worse

The two women are immediately concerned

VERONIQUE
What should we do

HOOKER oo
Here let me show you something If

I were you Id put ali my money in
the envelope

VERONIQUE

complies immediately pulling out a bankroll that knocks

00406 16

Hookers eyes out She puts it into the envelope and then
passes it to Giselle who dips into her purse and adds her
money to it She turns her body as she does so so that
Hooker cannot see how much money she has Hooker is amused
by her modesty Giselle then licks the envelope and seals
it

HOOKER
May I have the envelope a second

Giselle hesitates but Veronique makes her hand it over

HOOKER
All right you take the envelope
and stick it up under your arm
inside your coat like this

Hooker demonstrates by slipping the envelope inside his
tuxedo coat and up into his armpit By shooting from the
side we see that there is already another envelope there
the one with the cut paper

HOOKER
That way you can feel it all the
time and no pickpickets will be
looking for it there

He reaches back inside his coat and pulls out the envelope
but of course its not the one he put in Its the one with
the cut paper He hands it to Veronique who thanks him and
hands it to Giselle who tucks it up inside her coat glanc-
ing both ways to make sure no one saw her do it

HOOKER
I am sorry for all the commotion
here tonight I hope you enjoyed
your evening Countess

Giselle allows herself a little smile that Hooker is finally

using the proper term of address The Countess nods that her

evening has been satisfactory and Hooker takes his leave

ON HOOKER

We follow him as he walks right on out of the ballroom and
joins Eirie on the street

EXT ALLEY - NIGHT ON HOOKER AND EIRIE
Hooker is not nearly as elated as we might expect
EIRIE

Everything go okay
yeh

00406 17

HOOKER
Yeah it was easy I dont even
think we needed the build up I
coulda asked em for the money out-
right and theyda given it to me
Not that Im proud of it

EIRIE
(hefting the
envelope)
Yeah well let me see what we got
here Feels like enough to open
our own steel mill

Eirie rips open the envelope and pulls out the most beauti-
ful stack of sconstruction paper weve ever seen Not a
dollar bill in sight Hooker and Eirie stare at it in
shock for a second Then it begins to dawn on then

EIRIE
Hooker we been had

Barely are the words out of Eirie’s mouth than Hooker races
back into the club

INT BALLROOM - NIGHT

Hooker zeroes in on table sixteen Its empty He races
back outside

EXT ALLEY - NIGHT

Hooker frantically looks up and down the street for some
sign of the two women

HOOKER
I find that broad Im gonna wring
her neck

EIR
Forget it Shes probably halfway
home with our thirty bucks by now
Wouldnt that rot your socks

Eirie is somewhat amused by the whole thing Hooker is
fit to be tied He literally begins jumping up and down

HOOKER
We gotta do somethin’ Well call
the police thats what well do
Christ what kinda town are they
runnin where people can go around
pullin this sorta thing This burg
is crawlin with grifters and the
cops are pickin nose

00406 18

ANGLE 25

Eirie cant believe this outpouring of righteousness from
Hooker Hooker continues his tirade as they get into their
limousine

HOOKER
Usin construction paper yet Think
how the people who made that paper
would feel if they knew what she
was using it for They thought the
were makin somethin nice for little
kids This is the kinda thing that
gives construction paper a bad name

ANOTHER ANGLE 26

As the limousine pulls out we move to reveal that Lonnegans
man Floyd has been watching the departure from a car across
the street We cant see whos in the back seat but we can
guess

cut TO
EXT HOOKERS APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT 27

The limousine pulls up in front of the building and Hooker
and Eirie get out hey are just about to go up the front
steps when two thugs jump out of the shadows scaring the
heli out of all of us not to mention Hooker and Eirie
Hooker tries to run for it but hes caught and slammed up
against a wall

THUG
You Johnny Hooker
HOOKER
Maybe
THUG

Were from Atlas Tuxedo You told
our guy to bill you We checked
your credit -- you aint got none
Our boss dont like to be stiffed
That tuxll be ten bucks

HOOKER
I aint got it

2 G
Then you either give up the tux or
your good looks

Hooker pulls out his pockets with his best “have mercy
smile He looks from some sign that its winning the
thugs over Fat chance

CUT TO

00406 19

INT HOOKERS APARTMENT BUILDING’ STAIRWAY - NIGHT 28

walking up the stairs of Hookers apartment building
Hooker having lost the tuxedo is now clad only in his
YMCA yn shorts his knee socks (suspenders) and of course
his alligator shoes It hasnt been his night

EIRIE

HOOKER
(tired as hell)

INT HOOKERS APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY 29

Eirie starts off toward his room as Hooker tries to open

the door to his own room Suddenly the door opens by

itself and Hooker finds himself looking at a large Man in
a food-stained undershirt

MAN
Somethin I can do for you
HOOKER
Yeh this is my apartment

hour ago Seems you wasnt paid up

Hooker gives Eirie a look that could melt a brick

MAN

Without further ado he closes the door

IN THE HALLWAY 30

Hooker and Eirie start back down the stairs

EIRIE

EIRIE

HOOKER

outs tonight Eirie

Look out Johnny Hooker is back

cuT To
INT THE ATLANTIC CITY RAILROAD STATION - NIGHT 31

We pick up Hooker and Eirie as they come into the station
and fan out in different directions Hooker is wearing
Eiries clothes which look ridiculous on him The pants
are a good eight inches too short and the shirt is burst-
ing at the seams showing patches of skin between the
uttons

00406 21

INT TRAIN STATION - GIFT SHOP - NIGHT 32

We follow Eirie into the gift shop where he goes to the toy
section He looks through several small novelties until he
finds what hes looking for -- a little tin replica of a
policemans badge He looks around for store detectives
and seeing none slips the badge into his pocket

cut TO
INT TRAIN STATION - CORRIDOR - HOOKER 33

in another part of the station We see him removing a sign
from a door but the angle prohibits us from being able to
read it He drops the sign in a waste can and walks out
into the passenger lobby Eirie passes him and slips him
the tin badge

INT TRAIN STATION - ANOTHER SECTION 34

After scanning the area carefully for a minute Hooker goes
up to a conservative-looking Businessman whos busy reading

e schedule board Hooker flashes open his wallet to reveal
the little tin badge and then quickly closes it again

HOOKER
Excuse me sir Treasury Department
Id like to ask you a few questions

BUSINESSMAN
What for I havent done anything

HOOKER
We dont doubt that but theres a
counterfeiting operation passing bad
money in the station Have you made
any purchases here today

BUSINESSMAN

Well yes a small gift and some
food
HOOKER

Then Im afraid well have to im-
pound your money until were sure
that its all good Can I see your

BUSINESSMAN
(handing it over)
But I got a train to make

HOOKER

00406 23

- 2 34
BUSINESSMAN

HOOKER
(with a
little wave)
Think nothing of it

The Businessman goes off down the hall more than grateful
for the special treatment

GONDORFF

Police in Atlantic city got a tip
They pulled him out of the bay with
cement on his feet

HOOKER
Lonnegan

GONDORFF
I thought so at first but this
isnt his style Besides what
would he be doin in Atlantic City
The word is it was a hood named
Carlo Macalinski

HOOKER
Its not like Twist to con a
racketeer How could he get so
down on his luck to do somethin
like that

GONDORFF
Look at us three We paintin any
pictures of success

Its a question that needs no reply The answer is obvious

EIRIE
You gonna go after this guy

GONDORFF

After the Lonnegan con I said wed
never do anything like that again
We keep stinging heavy gees no
matter how good the reason and
pretty soon there wont be any place

shoulders to indicate he has no idea whats in it The Big

duction of Taylor What poetry

HOOKER
You watch my’ guy Henry Hes got
the greatest right Ive ever seen

IN THE RING

The bell rings and the fighters come out Immediately
Typhoon backs Healy into a corner and unleashes the famous
right It misses crashing mightily into a ring post It
danm near splinters the thing Hooker wasnt kidding
Taylor has a great right Unfortunately were about to
find out what he doesnt have -- any defense While
Typhoon is busy admiring the damage hes done to the post
Healy blasts two shots to the body and a left hook to the
chin ‘Typhoon goes on his face

ON HOOKER

Hooker jumps up immediately and hops down to ringside to
talk to Taylor whose head is hanging over the side of the
ring

HOOKER
Dont let this upset ya Typhoon

if he knew his own name right now He gets up at eight and
waits for Healy to come in on him He crouches but none
too sure of his directions at this point uncorks a left

instead of a right It catches Healy full on the chin
Unfortunately Healy doesnt seem to notice Whatever
power there was in hoons left is gone Healy unloads
a right cross to Typhoons jaw Typhoon being a much
more observant type goes on his back landing very close
to where he went down last time

door and goes inside

INT SMALL MEETING ROOM

Instead of hanging beef sides in the refrigerator we find
a small meeting room Around the table in the center are
Gondorff Eirie Singleton the Big Ohio and the Tuxedo Kid
Gondorff is dressed in his usual casual attire - sleeve-
less T-shirt fedora hat and cigar The Tuxedo Kid provides
a splash of color with a lime-green number Hooker pulls up
a chair

GONDORFF
All right lets get started
Whats the news on this guy JJ

Singleton organizes some notes hes made

SINGLETON
I tell ya Henry Macalinskis been
around He started as a strong-arm
at a carnival Then he ran a shell
game a monte booth even did some
of the magic when the magician was
too soused to go on But most of
all he discouraged the customers
from takin too close a look at how
they were losin their money They
say he still likes to do a trick or
two at his parties when he gets a
few drinks in him A guy walked
out once when he was doin a rope
trick They found him the next day
with his feet in a drill press He
never walked at all after that let
alone out of a party

This piece of information has a very sobering effect on the
group

EIRIE
Why do we always gotta go up against
these types

00406

GONDORFF
If they werent these types we
wouldnt have to

HOOKER
So if hes not a carney worker
anymore what the hell is he

BIG OHIO
He became an enforcer for Gandi
Bellino in 34 At the time
Bellino was tryin to nail down
all the prostitution in the city
He put Macalinski in charge of
his gunsels After Macalinski
finished torpedoing the opposition
he torpedoed Bellino Now he runs
more girls than anybody on the
island Hes still a shitty magi-
cian though

GONDORFF
He musta made a few enemies during
all this

BIG OHIO
Yeah but nothin he cant handle
Hes got some sore spots though
For one thing he cant stand
Negroes Guys like JoJo Berry and
Willie Bates He says they give
prostitution a bad name by sellin’
cheap It really frosts his butt
when they pick up the good white
talent

GONDORFF
Okay Tuxedo what do you got on
his personal habits

oo TUXEDO KID
Macalinskis the glamour type
Snappy dresser big tipper owns
the Bluebird Club down on the pier
Buys a new suit every day wears it
once and then burns it They say
hes got fity-four diamond rings
and ee hundred pair of shoes

ot every vice there is and a

few Im not acquainted with but
his biggest weakness is the janes
He thinks hes death to women

GONDORFF

Is he

TUXEDO KID

You never see him with less than

four

This creates a general feeling of disgust around the table
If theres one thing a grifter cant stand in a mark its

pretention

GONDORFF

Do any of these dames ever stay
tight with him

TUXEDO KID

Naw he doesnt like women that much
He just cant stand it when they

dont

Looks

like him

HOOKER
like we might be able to use

a woman on him in the setup

If we

GONDORFF
can find one with grifting

experience

TUXEDO KID
Hed be a perfect mark except for
the fact that he probably knows all
the standard cons from his carney

days

GONDORFF

Then well have to go with a new

one

Watchin’ Typhoon the other

night I got an idea for a fight
con that might be good for this

clown

I thought wed call it the

HOOKER
Why dont we get a real fighter

GONDORFF
Naw we need somebody who can grift
And Eirie said you were a Golden
Gloves champion

HOOKER
Yeh but that was fifteen years ago

GONDORFF

Hooker realizes its useless to protest He nods his head
in acceptance of his role

GONDORFF
All right then well all have to

Gondorff looks around the table Everybodys in

VERONICA

phony Hes nothin but a two-bit
con artist I know I beat him on
a switch just last week when he
tried

Veronica stops in midsentence realizing what shes just

admitted Mr Hertel is more upset by this than if she were

an embezzler Whatever doubts he had about Hooker are now

ows shes had it

Located on the amusement pier the Bluebird is Macalinskis

the street obviously waiting for something Its the night
for the con to begin and theyre all a little edgy Veronica
is particularly quiet in the back seat

CUT TO
INT THE BLUEBIRD CAFE - NIGHT 84

The most exclusive club in Atlantic City and definitely in
the tradition of the great supper clubs of the early forties
Characterized by its bold deco design satin curtains and
tablecloths and an elevated bandstand with its Busby Berkeley
backdrops the Bluebird prides itself on its elegance The
bandstand is actually divided into three tiers the top tier
(containing xr and piano player) a good twelve feet
above the floor The waiters are all dressed in black tux-
edos the band in tails and the cocktail waitresses and
cigarette girls in tuxedoettes -- backless tuxedo jackets
tuxedo shorts with cummerbund high heels with spats and
top hat -- much like the girls in Fatha Hines Grand Terrace
Orus

ANGLE 85

Hooker and Eirie enter the club and after checking their

hats move to a position to eyeball the floor

THEIR POINT OF VIEW 85-A

Then the band vocalist is into a rendition of I Cant Get

Started

BACK WITH ERIE AND HOOKER 85-B
EIRIE

Which one is him

HOOKER
The guy at the table in back with
all the bimbos around him

ON MACALINSKI 86
sitting at his private table holding court with several

arty girls of the period A physically imposing but less
than handsome man hacalineki iressen with all the flash of

the true narcissist His tastes are expensive like the

Tuxedo Kids but not nearly as good

87 ON VERONICA 87

Veronica enters the club now a vision in black satin She
informs the maitre d that shes alone and is led to a table
within Macalinskis line of sight She lights a cigarette
and surveys the room a stunning presence at once sophisti-
cated and totally relaxed

87-A ON MACALINSKI 87A

Macalinski spies her just as another guy sits down with her

87-B ON EIRIE AND HOOKER 87-B

EIRIE
Whos that jerk

HOOKER
I dont know but we gotta get hin
outta there Give him a call Eirie

88 WITH EIRIE 88

Eirie immediately walks over to Veronicas table On the
way he snatches a napkin from an empty table and drapes it
over his arm giving him the appearance of a waiter

EIRIE
Excuse me sir whats your name

RICHARDSON
Richardson Lionel Richardson

EIRIE
Thats what I thought Mr Richardson
theres a call for you in the lobby
On the green phone

Richardson gets up to take his call wondering who could be
calling him here

89 ON MACALINSKI 89

Macalinski looks over again and catches Veronicas eyes

She makes contact giving just a hint of interest and then
demures slightly Macalinski takes it as an invitation He
gets up and moves confidently toward Veronicas table leav
ing his entourage to fend for itself

00406 52

AT VERONICAS TABLE 90

He arrives at the table and goes into his opening line only
to find another Voice saying it in unison with him

MACALINSKI AND VOICE
Good evening mind if I sit down

ANGLE 91

Macalinski and the camera turn toward the source of the other
Voice Standing there is one of the sharpest-looking black
men we have ever seen Resplendent in an ivory suit with
vest shoes and hat to match the man is particularly strik-
ing because of his deep blue eyes Of course the man is
Gondorff

Both men look at each other with contempt but each adopts a
civil tone

GONDORFF
There seems to be an echo in here
MACALINSKI

Excuse me but Im afraid I was here

first
GONDORFF

Im sorry but I believe I was here

first

Gondorff looks to Veronica to settle the dispute

GONDORFF
Madam

VERONICA
I really couldnt tell It seemed
you both were here at the same time

MACALINSKI
Who would you prefer then

VERONICA
I dont know either of you well
enough to prefer Its no disgrace
for co men to sit at the same table
isi

00406 53

Both men exchange glances as if fully expecting the other to
leave When it doesnt happen both sit none too happy with
the situation

MACALINSKI
(to Veronica)
Im Carlo Macalinski I own the
club here You may have heard of

me
VERONICA
No Im sorry Im new in Atlantic
City
(offerin
her hand

Lola Forrest

Veronica turns to Gondorff now He takes her hand and kisses
it as he introduces himself Macalinski is disgusted by
Gondorffs elaborate chivalry

GONDORFF
Ivory Berrigan Its a pleasure to
meet you Miss Forrest

VERONICA
Do you live here too

GONDORFF
No Im here on business Unfortu-
nately I have to travel quite a bit
overseeing various interests When
T encounter a woman of your charm
it makes all the miles worthwhile

VERONICA
Well thank you Mr Berrigan Youre
very kind

Macalinski wants to throw up

I was wondering if youd like to go
somewhere nice for dinner I know a

GONDORFF
I beg to differ Mr Macalinski

Macalinski has had enough The pretense of amiability is

quickly dropped

- MACALINSKI
Why dont you come off that phony
culture bit Youre not foolin
Miss Forrest Shes gonna be spend
ing the evening with me

GONDORFF
Maybe if you chain her to the table

VERONICA
Gentlemen

MACALINSKI
You know I could always have you
shown to the door

GONDORFF
I doubt if that would make a favor-
able impression with Miss Forrest

- And it might look to your staff like
you were afraid of me

VERONICA
Please theres really no need

Veronicas pleas for peace are a drop in the bucket Theres

no turning back now

MACALINSKI
You dont worry me Berrigan Just
‘cause you shined enough shoes to
buy yourself a suit dont mean you
can play with the white folks I
own this town Miss Forrest knows
T can give her anything she wants

GONDORFF
Except class They wouldnt even let
you in here if you didnt own the
place

00406 55

MACALINSKI
(gettin
hot now
Who you talkin to about class brown
boy Ive had over five hundred fe-
males in my life

GONDORFF
Yeh but four hundred ninety of em
were sheep —

Macalinski stands up as to invite Gondorf£ outside just as

ANOTHER ANGLE

Eirie passes by with a drink Eirie makes sure to bump into
him showering the drink all over Macalinskis head and suit
Eirie apologizes profusely but receives nothing but verbal

abuse in return

While Macalinski is busy toweling off his suit Gondorff
comes over and attempts to dry Macalinskis hair with a nap-
kin He makes one swipe and suddenly Macalinski is bald

VERONICA
Mr Macalinski your hair

Macalinski reaches for the top of his head and feels only
skin He has a terrible realization as Gondorff looks in
his napkin and holds up a slightly soggy hairpiece

a GONDORFF
This is real convenient Macalinski
Well just send this rug out to be
ary cleaned and you wont have to
wash your hair Whatll they think
of next Is that your real nose

Macalinskis humiliation has given way to pure rage He
tries to snap the toupee out of Gondorffs hands

MACALINSKI
Give me that

Unfortunately Gondorff pulls away slightly as Macalinski
grabs the hair causing the hairpiece ‘split right up the
middle At this point Gondorff lets go and calls for a
waiter loud enough for the whole club hear

00406 26

GONDORFF

Waiter waiter Could we get some
thread over here Mr Macalinski
seems to have a run in his wig

Macalinski motions the waiter to get lost or fear for his
ife

GONDORFF
(with

sincerity)
Thats too bad It was such a nice
one too You probably get lotsa
compliments on that Course youd
Fhink theyd give ya better glue with
it

MACALINSKI
You watch your tongue nigger or
youll wake up one morning without it

ANOTHER ANGLE

Macalinski has said this with his back to Veronica so that
she hasnt heard it’ Gondorff figures maybe its time to lay
off for a while Both men take their seats as Macalinski
reaches for a deck of cards in the center of the table

MACALINSKI
(surprisingl
composed now)
I think we owe it to Miss Forrest to
settle our differences like gentlemen
A simple game of skill

Macalinski puts two cards face down on the table He then
goes throug the deck and pulls out the queen of diamonds
He holds it up for Gondorff and Veronica to see

MACALINSKI
The queen in honor of Miss Forrest

He puts the queen face down on the table between the two other
cards and lays the rest of the deck aside As he does it we
see him slip one card up his sleeve

MACALINSKI
The game is simple enough I move
the cards around Mr Berrigan
tries to pick out the queen If he
does hell have the pleasure of
Miss Forrests company alone If
not hell leave this club and never
return Fair enough Berrigan

00406 57

GONDORFF
Fair enough

MACALINSKI
(to Veronica)
Why dont you try it once just to
show Mr Berrigan how its done

VERONICA
All right if you insist

Macalinski moves the cards Its easy to follow the queen
it ends up in the middle Veronica picks it out with no
rouble

MACALINSKI
See nothin to it Berrigan Even
you should be able to do it

As Macalinski takes the queen back from Veronica he palms
it and replaces it with the card up his sleeve Its done

in a movement so deft that we can only see it in slow motion

Gondorff and Veronica cant possibly have seen it at all
Macalinski puts the new card face down in the middle again
with everyone assuming its still the queen

MACALINSKI
All right Berrigan your turn

Macalinski begins moving the cards again more quickly this
time but its still not difficult to follow the card that
should have been the queen It ends up in the middle again

MACALINSKI
Well which one is it

Gondorff studies the cards It seems like theres no way he
can win None of them are queens Gondorff puts his hands
on the two outside cards

GONDORFF
Ill say its neither of these two

Before Macalinski can protest Gondorff flips over the two
cards Neither of course is the queen

GONDORFF
Looks like I win The queen has got
to be the other one

Macalinski does a slow burn but theres nothing he can do
Hes been outfoxed He goes to take in the non-queen thats
still face down but Gondorffs hand is on it first

00406 58

NDORFF
I just wanta thank the little lady
before she goes back in the deck

Gondorff flips over the card Its a four of clubs Veronica
reacts with feigned shock Macalinski tries to maintain his
ignity

GONDORFF
If youll excuse us Miss Forrest
and I have a date for dinner

MACALINSKTI
(to Veronica)
Youre not really gonna go out with
him are ya

VERONICA
It would be a pleasure

As Veroncia and Gondorff get up to leave Gondorff flips a
dollar bill toward Macalinski

GONDORFF
Thats for the use of the table Keep
-the change
(pointin
seating i te
shoes)
Maybe you can get yourself a shine

Macalinski gives Gondorff a look that could kill

WITH GONDORFF

as he turns and leaves the club with Veronica on his arm
He winks at Hooker as he passes his table

ON MACALINSKI

as he starts back toward his own table Theres a tap on
his shoulder He turns around to find a very agitate
Lionel Richardson

RICHARDSON
Excuse me sir I was told you were
the owner Can you tell me where
the green phone is

to talk to

Buzz off

He walks away leaving poor Richardson to make another futile
search for his telephone call

EXT THE BLUEBIRD CLUB LATER THAT NIGHT 96

Macalinski accompanied by three bodyguards comes out a side
door of the club and walks down the pier to the amusement
center Hes generally in a foul mood and has sent the
women home for the night

EXT AMUSEMENT PARK - NIGHT 97

A couple of concessionaires say hello to Macalinski but he
doesnt respond As he reaches the park entrance Hooker
approaches from the side Hes dressed more working class
now complete with a Cagney beret He adopts the speech
pattern of a prizefighter

(OOKER
Mr Macalinski

Hooker gets no acknowledgement from Macalinski but is imme-
diately surrounded by two bodyguards Macalinski walks on
ahead

HOOKER
I wanta see Macalinski
‘BODYGUARD
He dont wanna see nobody
HOOKER

Tell him its about Ivory Berrigan

One of the bodyguards hustles ahead to Macalinski They have
a short conference and the Bodyguard waves Hooker and the
second bodyguard forward Macalinski however doesnt wait
for them He continues on toward his objective

HOOKER
Where are we goin Cant I talk to
him here

BODYGUARD

Hes takin his ride He does it
every night before he goes to bed
Says it helps him sleep
00406 60

98 EXT AMUSEMENT PARK - AT PARACHUTE JUMP NIGHT 98

Finally Macalinski reaches his destination -- the famous
Parachute Jump an awesome tower of steel reaching 300 feet
into the air culminating at the top in a brightly lit eight-
pronged platform Suspended by long cables from each prong
of the platform are the flimsy” looking two-seater chairs
which now dangle a few feet off the ground waiting for the
next round of riders Having no weight in them at this
point the chairs swing slightly in the breeze sending
pinging noises up the cables which just seem to disappear
in the dark sky above Not a ride for the faint of heart
The Operator of the parachute is quite familiar with
Macalinski

OPERATOR

Evening Mr Macalinski Oughta be
able to see all the way to Philadelphia
tonight

Macalinski just nods For the first time he turns to face
Hooker who has caught up by now

MACALINSKI
You was in the club tonight right
HOOKER
Yeah but
MACALINSKI

(pointing to the
parachute chair)
Get in

Hooker looks up at the tower Hes not at all sure he wants
to get in that seat
MACALINSKI
You wanna talk or dont ya

Hooker nods weakly and gets into the seat The Operator straps
them in and the chair begins to rise

98-A ON HOOKER AND MACALINSKI 98-A

Hed been plannin to do that as a
favor for some friends of his JoJo
Berry and Will Bates who dont like
you so good just to make you look
bad in your own joint

MACALINSKI
(sarcastically)
And you felt so bad about it you
decided to tell me so I could kill ya

HOOKER
Hey look I got nothin’ against you
Im a fighter not a mob gee I just
done what he tells me up to now

MACALINSKI
Are these business interests he says
hes got all fighters

HOOKER
Yeah me and a couple other guys who
aint worth shinola He makes his
dough offa my right hand

Hooker holds up a clenched right fist to demonstrate the
point

HOOKER

See when I signed with this my he
told me he was gonna bring me along
right

At this point Hooker happens to glance down at the ground

HOOKERS POINT OF VIEW - THE GROUND BELOW 99

which is now about 150 feet away It scares the hell out of
im

BACK WITH HOOKER 99-A

HOOKER

more and Berrigan tells me I gotta
throw the fight so he can pay off
some markers Take a dive in the
fifth So Im out there fresh as
a daisy aint been hit with nothin
all night and I gotta lie down

Hooker steals another quick glance at the ground

HOOKERS POINT OF VIEW - THE GROUND BELOW
The height is starting to get to him

BACK WITH HOOKER AND MACALINSKI

Macalinski meanwhile continues to take in the sights like
he was looking out a train window

HOOKER
So he leaves me alone the next three
fights I bust three more guys
including Frankie Carl who aint no
bum I rake him out in the fourth

So now I got a shot at Kelley ina

week who couldnt beat me with an
axe and Berrigan wants me to go in
the water again Every time I start
gettin someplace he tanks me out

I aint gonna take that no more I
coulda been eight and zero by now
and fightin high rankers

ANOTHER ANGLE

The height is about 240 feet now and the wind is beginning
to blow the chair around a little Hooker is struggling to
maintain his cool

MACALINSKI
Thats very touching but what do ya
need me for

HOOKER

If I cross Berrigan Im gonna need
some protection I dont take that
dive and his people 1i break my
legs They tell me you got some
muscle in this town I dont know

percent at even odds thats ah

About fifteen minutes
HOOKER

OkayFifty percent Look I aint

an Hooker takes a look but quickly fixes again on a point about
‘two feet in front of his face He really looks bad now

The rigid expression of one who is really scared stiff

103

Suddenly the bottom drops outand the chair plunges in what
seems like free fall So realistic was this ride that the
Armed Forces used to use it to train paratroopers The last
glimpse we had of Hooker was one of sheer terror About
eighty feet from the bottom a parachute opens and slows the
final stages of the descent We

like hed just been for a manicure Hooker staggers out
not at all sure of his balance

Ill think about it What gym you
train at

HOOKER
Goldings on Seventh Where should
I call ya The club

theyre safely out of sight he stumbles over to a trash can
and throws up

EXT A DINER ON THE AMUSEMENT PIER - NIGHT 105

A typical waterfront greasy spoon with a horseshoe counter
and napkin holders that dispense fortunes

INT DINER ON THE PIER - NIGHT 106

Hooker enters the diner to get something to settle his
stomach The place is pretty empty this time of night
Hooker orders a bicarbonate While hes waiting he happens
to look across the counter just as a familiar face looks

up at him Its his old friend Lieutenant Snyder the
Chicago bunco detective The two men are astonished to

see each other At first neither of them moves from his
position

00406 65

‘ SNYDER
Hi there Hooker Remember me

HOOKER
How could I forget you Snyder
What are you doin in Atlantic City
bringin in a new disease

Snyder has long since learned to let cracks like that roll
off his back He feigns casualness but is ready to move

at the slightest hint that Hooker is going to flee Hooker
on the other hand is finely attuned to any sign that Snyder
may attack Hookers bicarbonate is brought to him by the
fountain attendant

SNYDER
Im with the federal bunco people
now Came down here to pinch a guy

HOOKER
(drinking his
bicarbonate)
Well I hope you find hin

SNYDER
I just did Didnt expect him to
walk right up to me though

HOOKER
Youre bluffin The feds got bigger
guys to worry about than me

SNYDER

Not this one I coulda overlooked
that three grand in bad notes you
slipped me in Chicago but when you
played me for the chump in that
Lonnegan caper that tore it It
was all I could do to keep Lonnegan
from puttin a bullet in me I
figure if you go up for a ten-year
stretch it might square things up

HOOKER
You know it aint gonna do no good
to chase me Ive always been faster
than you

SNYDER
Yeah but I got the endurance I
been waitin four years for this

ANOTHER ANGLE

Snyder gets up from his stool to make his move Hooker
flips a coin on the counter to pay for the bicarbonate and
then sprints out the door with Snyder in close pursuit

EXT AMUSEMENT PARK PIER NIGHT - ON HOOKER

racing down the amusement midway with Snyder at his heels
both dodging the street vendors and the scattered people
still strolling the pier at this hour Hooker makes for the
Fun House leaping the turnstile much to the surprise of the
attendant Snyder flashes his badge as he crashes through

cut TO
INT FUN HOUSE - NIGHT

Like most forties fun houses this one consists of a series
of obstacles that one must pass through to get out Once
youre in the progression you have to go on Theres no
turning back The obstacles are designed to be fun if taken
at a deliberate speed If youre in a hurry the place can
be treacherous Neither Hooker nor Snyder are deliberating

FUN HOUSE ENTRANCE TUNNEL

The first obstacle is a revolving drum just inside the
entrance tunnel Its difficult enough to walk through
But Hooker tries to take it at a dead run Hes thrown
down violently and tumbles several times Snyder is able
to grab him for an instant but is immediately thrown off
his feet too

ANGLE

The two men grapple fiercely tumbling head over heels
banging off the walls flailing at each other with arms and
legs Neither is able to establish dominance because of
the constant revolving of the drum Hooker finally kicks
himself free and scrambles out on hands and knees Both
men have taken a terrible beating

ANOTHER TUNNEL IN THE FUN HOUSE

Hooker jumps to his feet and heads into another tunnel this
one pitch dark Still the two go as fast as they can in an
effort to gain ground crashing from side to side tripping

on things knocking over the laughing clowns and roaring

devils that pop out at them

lll

00406 67

AT A FOUR-LANE SLIDE IN THE FUN HOUSE

Hooker emerges from the tunnel at the top of a four-lane
slide Usually one negotiates the slide by sitting on a
burlap sack Hooker disdains the sack flinging himself
down the slope head first Both are getting skin burns to
go with the bruises they got in the barrel Neither man is
having fun in this house

IN THE FUN HOUSE - AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SLIDE

Hooker has his choice of the Slanted House or the Mirror
Maze A good mirror maze is truly a confounding experience
People have been known to get lost in them for upwards of

an hour

IN THE FUN HOUSE MIRROR MAZE

Snyder charges in after Hooker and is brought to a quick
stop by the sight of sixteen different images of himself
The pace of the chase now changes completely

Snyder makes his way slowly through the maze painstakingly
trying to discern the real path from all the reflected ones
Every once in a while an image of Hooker will flash across
several mirrors but Snyder has no idea which one to chase
Its quiet now the only sound the labored breathing of the
two men Hooker finally calls to Snyder from another part

of the maze

HOOKER
You never shoulda followed me in
here Snyder Ive been through
this maze a hundred times

-SNYDER
It dont matter what you do Hooker
Im not leavin Atlantic City with-
out you

HOOKER
Guess I might as well give up then

Suddenly Hooker appears right off Snyders left shoulder

He cocks his arm for a punch but Snyder catches him out of
the corner of his eye whirls around and smashes a mighty
blow to Hookers gut Or what he thought was Hooker Un-
fortunately its just another mirror image Hooker because
of his experience in this maze knew just where to stand to
create a single reflection Snyders punch splinters the
mirror to bits and opens a nasty cut on his head

00406 68

CONT INUED 115

Snyder is an enraged bull now Several images of Hooker
begin to appear in the mirrors Snyder goes after ali of
them wildly clubbing them with his pistol butt kicking
them with his boots shattering mirror after mirror in a
frantic attempt to destroy the real Hooker Finally all the
images of Hooker disappear and Snyder hears his footsteps
receding rapidly in the distance He knows by the time he
finds his way out Hooker will be long gone He looks back
at the trail of destruction hes left and then slumps back
against the wall in exhaustion We hold a beat and —

back to the meat locker

INT MEETING ROOM - NIGHT 117

Gondorff Singleton The Big Ohio the Tuxedo Kid and Eirie

GONDORFF

stretch

HOOKER

stretch Kid Twist is doin either
Ive stayed away from Snyder this
long I can lose him for another
couple weeks

GONDORFF
(tired)
Okay lets knock off for tonight
CUT TO
EXT AN ATLANTIC CITY STREET - NIGHT 118

Its late at night now and the street is about deserted
Hooker is making his way home staying in the shadows as much
as possible in case Snyder may be patrolling the streets

He passes an apartment building and sees a ight on in a
third floor window He stops for a second considers it

and decides to enter the building

CUT TO
INT VERONICAS APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT - HOOKER 119

getting off the elevator an old cage-type at the third

HOOKER
Howdy I was in the neighborhood
I thought Id drop by and say you
did a nice job on Macalinski tonight

VERONICA
(making no move
to invite him in)
It was nothin Just another con

HOOKER
If it was so nothin why arent
you asleep yet

VERONICA
Just restless I guess

Hooker tired of standing in the doorway walks right in
much to the chagrin of Veronica

120 INT VERONICAS APARTMENT NIGHT 120

VERONICA
I didnt invite you in

HOOKER
I thought you might like some company
for a change I never see you with
anybody Christ Sheridan how come
youre so hard-nosed all the time
I mean now that were even Steven

VERONICA
We aint never gonna be even Steven
and if I wanted company I woulda
got some I know ten guys I could
call right now and theyd be up
here inside a five minutes

HOOKER

All right I wont stay long I know

you wanna get back to not worryin

about the con Can I have a beer

Ill pay ya for it
Hooker goes in the icebox and gets two bottles of beer
Veronica plunks herself down on the couch her arms crossed
She is restless

00406

VERONICA
Get me one too Maybe itll make me
tired If I didnt have to worry
about Macalinski seein me I could
go out dancin or somethin’

HOOKER
You could dance here
VERONICA
Not likely You need a partner
HOOKER
You got one
VERONICA

Aw cmon I used to teach dancin’
I dont dance with just any shlump

HOOKER
(infuriated)

You think I cant dance I happen

to be from Chicago sweetheart

VERONICA
So am I
HOOKER
You go to high school at all
VERONICA
Yeah Taft
HOOKER

Taft I went to Jefferson Scored
two touchdowns on ya in 24 Eighty-
five yard punt return Sixteen yard
end run And I was only a sophomore
If Id ever gotten to be a junior

no tellin how many I mighta scored

VERONICA
That dont mean you can dance
Everybody knows a Jaffie couldnt
take two steps in a row

HOOKER
Why would I ask ya to dance if I
couldnt dance

00406 72

- 2 120
VERONICA
You didnt come over to dance I
know what you came up here for
None of the guys at Jefferson could
do that either

HOOKER
Not with a Taft broad anyhow You
were liable to catch somethin’
(going over to
the record player)
Sit tight doll I11 show ya whos
from Chicago

Hooker searches quickly through some records and finds some-
thing he likes Glenn Millers In The Mood He puts it on
the turntable and drops the needle He moves a couple chairs
out of theway to make more room as the intro starts
Veronica cant believe this

HOOKER
All right Sheridan Do your worst

ANOTHER ANGLE 121

The beat comes up and Hooker and Veronica launch into the
most knock-down killer-diller lindy jitterbug we have ever
seen featuring all the great air steps and acrobatics the
early forties could muster Veronica executes an amazing
series of twirls kicks and jumps that come within inches of
taking Hookers head off Hooker on the other hand is a
great power dancer whipping Veronica around like a top
throwing her over his back around his shoulders and under
his legs Theyre both dancing fluidly but with a certain
savagery -- each one trying to outdo the other each one
trying to push the dance into steps that the other cant
follow Its a slam-bang two minutes The Soul Train All-
Starts got nothin on this

The record ends and the dance finishes in a draw Both Hooker
and Veronica maintain their nonchalance like it was a walk

in the park each trying hard to disguise the fact that theyre
gasping for breath Hooker chugs the last of his beer and

picks up his hat
HOOKER
Hope ya get some sleep
VERONICA

Yeah see ya around

00406 73

Hooker walks quietly out the door

Once hes gone Veronica sags into a chair completely worn
out but not a little bit exhilerated Shell get to sleep
tonight

‘Im nobodys baby I wonder why
Wont someone hear my plea

And please take a chance with me
Because Im nobodys baby now

FADE OUT

00406 74

FADE IN
INT LONNEGANS HOTEL ROOM - MORNING

The same room we saw him in at the beginning of the film
The photographs are still on the wall but theres now a

blank space where Kid Twistss picture once hung One of
Lonnegans aids Gelleher is showing him a flyer adver-

tising the Florian (Hooker)-Kelley fight

GELLEHER
Looks like theyre gonna use some
kinda boxing scam peddling Hooker
as a fighter I heard they tied
into Macalinski last year

LONNEGAN
Yeah Scanlon told me about it
Gondorff played him made up like
a nigger

Just the thought of what Scanlon told him starts Lonne

an
chuckling Pretty soon hes laughing almost uncontrollably

Gelleher is a little taken aback Hes never seen Lonnegan
like this before

LONNEGAN
(barely
able to
talk)
“You know what they did to him
GELLEHER
No what -

Lonnegan is laughing so hard it takes him ten seconds to
quiet down enough to tell Gelleher what Gondorff did

LONNEGAN
They took off his toupee
(breakin
up again
and ripped it

GELLEHER
(amazed)
And ripped

Lonnegan can only nod Hes convulsed with laughter again
He pounds the desk with sheer glee

ANOTHER ANGLE

Suddenly Floyd storms into the room obviously agitated about

something He plunks a copy of the Chicago Tribune down on
Lonnegans desk

00406

FLOYD
Doyle look at this That bastard
Chicago DA has indicted us Can you
believe them rabbits For tax eva-
sion the bum That suckers lookin

up and pointing
to the flyer)

LONNEGAN
No

(pause)
We get Macalinski to kill ‘em for us

FLOYD
Yeah but were the ones who took it
in the shorts What kinda charge
do we get outa this

LONNEGAN
Just the satisfaction of bringing
off a con that goes Gondorff one
better than he gave us As good as
his game was it only took our money
So Macalinski pulls the triggers
Dead is dead

FLOYD
Not to me it aint A i fo
always deader when I kill him

LONNEGAN

LONNEGAN

ace

CUT TO
INT GOLDINGS GYM - DAY - A MONTAGE SEQUENCE 124

detailing Hookers somewhat reluctant training for the Kelley
fight We see shots of him

1 skipping rope

2 shadow boxing in front of a mirror

3 practicing his crossing punches on the ‘punch
catchers held by The Big Ohio

4 working the speed bag He has a little trouble
with this last one as his timing is not yet sharp

All of this training is done under the supervision of The Big
Ohio who seems to be very knowledgeable about fighting

INT GOLDINGS GYM - DAY - ON HOOKER 125

We come out of the montage with Hooker throwing combinations
into the heavy bag Gondorff (in black face and the ivory
suit) and The Big Ohio are watching him Hooker is sweating
profusely and obviously getting a little tired The rest of
the gym is filled with confidence men all dressed out as
fighters and trainers but at this point theyre just sit-
ting around shooting the breeze

HOOKER
(gasping)
How much longer
THE BIG OHIO
(looking at
his stopwatch)
Minute and a half

00406 77

Thats too long Hooker drops his arms and stops punching

GONDORFF
Cmon youll never get in shape
that way

HOOKER

What difference does it make Im
gonna be down anyway

GONDORFF
Yeah but you gotta make it look good
Macalinskis gonna know somethins
wrong if you Just go out there and
get pulverized

HOOKER
How good is this guy Kelley

GONDORFF
(mimicking
Hooker )
What difference does it make Youre
gonna lie down anyway

HOOKER
Yeah but I wanta lie down with my
head on

GONDORFF
Then keep hittin the bag

Suddenly Eirie comes rushing into the gym

EIRIE
Macalinski just drove up outside

GONDORFF
Okay everybody lets get movin

Immediately all the previously inert confidence men spring to
their feet and begin the various rigors of training Some
work the speed bags and heavy bags some get rubdowns others
shadowbox The Tuxedo Kid takes up a position next to
Gondorff dressed in a gaudy checkered sport coat We

know this disguise is causing him great pain

GONDORFF
Ohio get in the ring and spar a few
rounds with Hooker And Ohio

h THE BIG OHIO
Yeah

GONDORFF
Get hit a lot

00406 78

125 - 2 125

Hooker and The Big Ohio quickly put on their protective head-
gear and jump into the ring Macalinski enters the gym with
three of the bodyguards He surveys the scene a second and
then spots Hooker sparring in the ring He comes over to
watch standing a couple feet behind Gondorff and the Tuxedo
Kid who pretend not to know hes there

Up in the ring Hooker is punching The Big Ohio all over the
lot The Big Ohio of course exaggerating the impact of
every blow Finally Hooker delivers a left hook and The
Big Ohio in a tour de force of acrobatics flips over the
ropes and clean out of the ring Gondorff calls Hooker and
pretends to be furious with him

GONDORFF

What the hell do ya think youre
doin I told you not to show that
left hook What if some sports-
writer had seen that You think
theyd ever believe you could lose
to Dann Kelley on the square with
a left hook like that

HOOKER
‘Im sorry I just forget my self

None of this has been lost on Macalinskis ears The Big Ohio
meanwhile is staggering to his feet

THE BIG OHIO
(dazed)
Sorry Berrigan Ive had enough

GONDORFF
Yeah all right
(shouting up
to Hooker)
Bobby thats enough for a while

Hooker climbs out of the ring and winks as he walks past
Macalinski Gondorff turns around and for the first time
is face to face with Macalinski

GONDORFF
Well if it aint Macalinski You
ever find that Queen

MACALINSKI
Yeah it was in my sleeve
(indicating
Gondorffs
suit)
1 found it cause I change my
clothes now and then

00406 79

GONDORFF
Oh this isnt the same suit you

Macalinski didnt resally come to talk fashion

MACALINSKI

GONDORFF

(with sarcasm

sweeping his

hand around

the gym) -
Well I1l leave ya to tend to all
your various business interests

GONDORFF
Yeah by the way Lola sends her love

Macalinski suppresses the urge to strangle Gondorff and
leaves the gym with his guard dogs On the way out he
passes Hooker toweling off

MACALINSKI

(out of
the side

a of his mouth)

Meet me at the Bluebird tonight at
nine oclock

Hooker nods and Macalinski disappears down the stairs
Gondorff looks over to Hooker for some sign Hooker gives
him both thumbs up

CUT TO

We pick up Hooker walking through the club and back to
Macalinskis office He knocks on the door

127 INT MACALINSKIS OFFICE 127

One of Macalinskis goons opens it and immediately yanks
Hooker inside and throws him up against a wall

HOOKER

pocket

MACALINSKI

Hooker sinks into a chair opposite Macalinskis desk still a
little shaken

MACALINSKI

HOOKER

EXT EIGHTH STREET GYM - DAY 154

Singleton has got his first shot posed The fighters are all
lined up in a row with their dukes up and menacing sneers on
their faces Behind them stand the trainers each with a
towel over his arm and one hand on his fighters shoulder
Out in front of all this stands Pyle his arms dramatically
crossed the moulder of men Next to him is Egan sporting
the most shit-eating grin weve ever seen

Singleton ducks under the black cloth tells everybody to hold
still and snaps his picture Some of the fighters turn to go
back into the gym but Billie stops them

BILLIE
Okay now well do an action one

The fighters shake their heads but they cooperate

Hookers fist

You cant do this for a real fight
They always check the tape Believe
me if he runs into that hand hell

HOOKER
Yeah but what am I supposed to do

Eirie bursts into the room with Savitts mouthpiece

GONDORFF

Theres a bottle of methyl chloride
over there Let the mouthpiece
soak in it a while Once Savitt

gets some of that in him he wont
able to walk let alone fight

We go to Hooker He has his doubts

EXT EIGHTH STREET GYM - DAY - FRONT OF THE BUILDING 156

Billie is rehearsing her action shot It calls for all of the
fighters to skip rope in unison under the watchful eye of
their trainers while Pyle and Egan of course maintain their
standard poses out front None of this is visible from

inside because like all gymnasiums the windows are frosted

Billie gives the signal to begin and all the fighters start
skipping but several are out of sync Billie stops them

BILLIE

No no no Lets try it again

GONDORF
Sorry pal nobody fights in this

Eirie of course produces the one thats been soaking in
methyl chloride Gondorff jams it into Savitts mouth who
winces at the taste

SAVITT
Christ this thing tastes terrible

GONDORFF
Thats just the antiseptic we use
What would you rather have tuber-
culosis

Savitt is pretty sure hed rather not have tuberculosis He
be ins to do a little shadowboxing as does Hooker on the

er side Even as he dances Savitt begins to shake his
head a little as if to clear it Gondorff decides its time
start He claps his hands and the two fighters come out

Hooker immediately begins dancing away from Savitt realizing
that Savitt is getting groggy Savitt stalks him and whips
out a few combinations but Hooker is staying so far away
that they do no damage

SAVITT
Whats the matter you scare of me
Florian

HOOKER

Just wanna give my legs some work
before I put you away

Hooker continues to back away as Savitt stalks him all over
the ring Macalinski doesnt like what hes seeing

MACALINSKI
Cmon Florian fight for chrissake

Savitt decides hes had enough of this too He backs Hooker
into a corner and comes in to finish him off Unfortunately
the methyl chloride is really getting to him now He throws

two wild haymakers which miss Hooker by a foot Savitt is
shaking his head and blinking his eyes now He looks ready

to fall asleep Realizing his opportunity Hooker steps
inside and smashes the right to Savitts stomach Savitt
doubles up although he was probably getting ready to fall
down anyway Then Hooker cranks up and unleashes his hardest
right to Savitts chin Savitt goes down and out like a light

Macalinski is amazed He comes up to Hooker as he starts to
untie his gloves

MACALINSKI

Nice work kid I didnt know you
had that kinda power Get your-
self a shower and well go

HOOKER
Dont need a shower Didnt even

gloves off and be right out

As Hooker goes off to the dressing room Gondorff comes over
to Macalinski

GONDORFF
I been in this business thirty years
and I aint never seen a guy with a
punch like that Whered you find

Macalinski isnt talking He just smiles and walks away
Meanwhile the bodyguards are dragging Savitt out to the car

As she stumbles forward he rears back and blasts her in the

only in accordance with his tastes hes drinking beer an¢
listening to something a little more upbeat Something like
Liltin Martha Tiltons The Lady is a Tramp Suddenly
Hooker gets a knock on his door Unlike Vernoica he immedi-
ately expects the worst Unlike Veronica he doesnt get it
He opens the door and she staggers in her nose swollen on
one side and a huge shiner on her right eye

HOOKER
Jesus what happened to you

VERONICA
(slumping onto
the couch)
I forgot to put on my makeup This
is the way I really look

HOOKER

for flippancy)

payin more attention to him You
think I could have a beer You
owe me one

HOOKER
(offering his)
Here finish this one

Veronica takes a long slow drink Hooker just gazes at her
a minute She becomes aware of it

VERONICA
What are you lookin at

HOOKER
I dont know Im just surprised
you came over here thats all I
mean you coulda called one of your
ten guys

VERONICA

I would of but I dont really like
any of em and you were closer Some-
times on a night like this you wonder
if everybody else doesnt like you as
much as you dont like them

(pause)
How about it Hooker How much dont
you like me

Veronica asks this question with real concern Shes not
being coy Hooker leans forward and kisses her tenderly on
all the bruised areas of her face He doesnt like her just
fine Veronica is not at all upset by this response

VERONICA
You think I could stick around here
a while
HOOKER
How long
VERONICA
Just until I get proper medical
attention
HOOKER
What if I said no
VERONICA

(lying)
Id find somebody else

She reaches up for his head and brings it down to her They
kiss with all the longing of strangers and the intimacy of

lovers for what will obviously not be the last time tonight

has one advantage Hes faster than Kelley but Kelley keeps
coming at him throwing punch after punch - jabs combina-

is able to dodge three-fourths of them but the one-fourth that
manage to land are beginning to take a toll

himself He clinches covers Up moves constantly and
flurries his way out of corners but Kelley is such a
dervish that Hooker is still taking a lot of shots

Hookers in trouble as hes slowing down and Kelly is scoring
more frequently Kelley connects with three wicked body shots
and a left to the head that sends Hooker reeling into the
ropes Instead of bouncing away he just stays there his
legs too tired to move him

ANOTHER ANGLE - IN THE RING 198

Even his flurry tactics dont slow Kelley who wades in and
unleashes another barrage Hooker can do nothing but try and
weather it He gives up all pretense to offense Its purely
a matter of survival now

calls on all the defensive quickness he can muster moving
his head slowing blows with the forearms and shoulders
ducking bobbing and leaning back over the ropes Almost
like Alis rope-a-dope Kelley meanwhile just keeps
banging away Hooker takes 1t and takes it and takes it
and finally just sags to the canvas The count gets to
eight and the bell rings

IN THE RING - HOOKERS CORNER 200

Eirie and The Big Ohio drag Hooker back to his corner and

IN THE RING - THE FIGHT 209

Hooker comes out and much to Kelleys surprise doesnt back
away Hooker throws a right-left combination and actually
lands one Kelley counters with another swarm of blows but
Hooker stands his ground and comes ripping back He smashes
a right to the chest a left to the ribs and an overhand right
to the head The fight is becoming a real slugfest Kelley
headhunting throwing big haymakers hooks and uppercuts
Hooker ducking inside jolting shots to the ribs and mid-
section Kelleys blows are more spectacularly visible from
even the cheap seats but Hooker is dishing it out to the
body and Kelley is beginning to feel it Hooker gains more
and more confidence if nothing else than for the fact hes
still on his feet Its turning into a helluva fight and
the crowd is warming to it All of them expect Lonnegan

IN THE STANDS - ON LONNEGAN 210

LONNEGAN
What the hell is goin on here

IN THE RING 211

Hooker and Kelley are literally toe to toe now tradin
punches as fast as their arms can work One thing is be-
coming increasingly clear however Kelley is beginning to
tire He has trained too little and thrown enough punches
for three fights and hes way behind on motivation Hooker
senses it and now his adrenalin really begins to flow

Hes taken Kelleys best shots and Kelly knows it

Hooker rips a left to the stomach and follows with a right

to the side of the head For the first time in the fight

Kelley begins to backpeddle looking for a little breathing
room

IN THE STANDS - ON MACALINSKI 212

One of the goons Rossovich returns a big smile on his face
Hes got the leather bag full of money with him

ROSSAVICH

The guy was still there Grimes
has got him out in the car We got
nothin’ to worry about The bets
off

Rossavich doesnt get the show of gratitude out of Macalinski
that hed expected At this point Macalinski is not at all
sure he wants that money back

IN THE RING 213

Hookers really into it now blasting away with both hands
Hooker crowds Kelley and hammers away to the body Kelley
stabs out with his right but the zip 1s gone from his
punches He tries to hold on but Hooker pushes him away
and starts pounding again

IN THE STANDS - ON LONNEGAN AND FLOYD 214

Lonnegan is speechless Floyd looks like hes growing
hemorrhoids

IN THE RING 215

Hooker backs Kelley into a corner Kelleys punches are just
awing the air now Hooker walking right through them just
eeps ripping to the body occasionally going to the head

but mostly burning up the midsection This 1s the first

round hes really thrown any punches so unlike Kelley hes
got something left despite the beating hes taken Kelle
drops his guard to protect his aching ribs and Hooker rocks
him with a right to the chin

IN HOOKERS CORNER 216

Eirie and The Big Ohio are going crazy in the corner Eirie
is filling the air with imaginary unches in an effort to urge
Hooker on He throws one so hard he falls down Gondorff

of course has got to maintain his cool having to preserve
the fiction that hes being double-crossed but we know

that hes exploding inside

IN THE RING 217

Hooker pummels away to the stomach again Kelleys guard
comes down and Hooker straightens him up with a wicked upper-
cut that knocks Kelleys mouthpiece clean across the ring
Kelleys arms are leaden This time his guard stays down
and his knees begin to sag Hooker measures him plants his
feet and blasts a right to the nose a right-left to the jaw
and cheekbone and finally a prodigious uppercut that catches
Kelley full on the chin He wavers a second and pitches for-
ward on his face

better have somebody watchin him
Lonnegan hired her right away ‘cause
he figured shed be a great way to
keep an eye on us He was the one
that told her to get next to you
She tipped me off on everything she
could but she didnt find out about

railing and swings himself back up on the train a burgeoning
smile on his face Helen Forrests Takin A Chance On Love

recedes into the distance
