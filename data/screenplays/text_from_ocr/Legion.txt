TITLE OVER BLACK

Come ye children listen to me I will teach you
the fear of the LORD

PSALM 3411

THE MOJAVE DESERT - DUSK
Vast Barren No signs of life
A BLOOD RED SUN is sinking behind the distant mountains

unbearable heat will soon become an unbearable cold
A YOUNG WOMANS VOICE Solemn Weary Determined

WOMANS VOICE
When I was a little girl my mother
would remind me each night before
bed to be sure to open my heart to
God for he was kind merciful and
just Things changed after my
father left a few years later
leaving her to raise me and my
brothers alone in a little place
out on the edge of the Mojave
Desert She never talked about a
kind and merciful God again
Instead she spoke of a prophecy
Of a time when all the world would
be covered in darkness and the fate
of Mankind would be decided One
night I finally got up the courage
to ask my mother why God had
changed why was he mad at his
children I dont know she
said tucking the covers around me
I guess he just got tired of all
the bullshit
And with these words the last trace of sunlight is SNUFFED
OUT leaving us in

DARKNESS

A darkness filled with the sounds of SIRENS GLASS
SHATTERING SPORADIC GUNFIREa CITY FALLING INTO CHAOS
TITLE Los Angeles December 23rd - 102 am

A BLOOD RED MOON

reflected in a greasy puddle of water Might just be the
smog thats making it that ominous color Then we notice
something moving in the reflection A dark shape growing
coming down at us fast Beatthen WHAM

TWO BLACK BOOTS
land hard in the waterand were in

EXT AN ALLEY WAY - LATE NIGHT

A DARK FIGURE in a tattered trench coat tumbles onto the
pavement hands out to slow the impact A beat then slowly
he climbs to his feet recovering from what seems to have
been quite a fall He has chiseled features shaved head
deep-set eyes Looks like hes been through one hell of a
fight

His name we will come to know is MICHAEL

He quickly checks out his surroundings nothing but brick
Seems

corner

walls above him Whered this guy jump from
A RUMBLE of thunderthen RAIN starts to hammer down

to motivate him

Michael pulls his overcoat tight around his body and dashes
toward the mouth of the alley He reaches the STREET just in
time to see a FLEET OF POLICE CARS tearing around the

SIRENS WAILING heading this way

He reels back into the alley way ducks down behind a trash
dumpster as the BLUE AND RED LIGHTS of the POLICE CARS whip
past

Michael waits for the lights to disappear then he pulls a
MASSIVE ORNATE KNIFE from his jacket Considers it grimly
Runs his finger along its edge Blood beads up Razor
sharp

Michael begins to peel off his overcoat revealing his bare
chest underneathand skin literally covered with DARK
TATOOS Hard to see what they are in this light

As his coat falls to the ground we DRIFT over to the BRICK
WALL behind him where we see MICHAELS SHADOW crouch over
and then

TWO LARGE SHAPES UNFOLD FROM HIS BACK STRETCHING UP INTO
WHAT ARE UNMISTAKABLYTHE SHADOW OF WINGS

The RAIN POUNDS harder as if punishment from the heavens
The glint of the KNIFE coming down fast

A HORRENDOUS SOUND OF FLESH TEARING AWAY FROM BONE

THE BLOODY KNIFE CLATTERING TO THE PAVEMENT

FOLLOWED BY MICHAELS UNGODLY SCREAM RISING UP FROM THE
ALLEY WAY And then SILENCE

CLOSE ON THE GUTTER AS BLOOD BEGINS TO FLOW FREELY MIXING

SWIRLING WITH THE RAIN

EXT CITY STREET - A SHORT WHILE LATER

Michael face tight with pain trench coat back on steps

of the alley stares with determination at a dark storefront
across the street

GUN and SPORT WORLD

INT GUN and SPORT WORLD - A SHORT WHILE LATER
Cavernous A Costco for survivalists Quiet except for

sound of RAIN then
SMASH Michael drops down through one of the skylights ina
shower of glass

INT GUN and SPORT WORLD - BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Michael bursts in Tosses a first-aid kit into the sink

His trench coat falls to the floor and here in the
fluorescent light we get a better look at him

His thin but stunningly well muscled body is TATTOOED
shoulder to ankle with INTRICATE WRITING The mans flesh is
a living book But the writing is in no language we
recognize

He turns his back to the mirror revealing two HORRIFICALLY
OPEN WOUNDS running down between both shoulder blades

FRESH BLOODY

He threads a needle not with thread but with FISHING WIRE
and begins to STITCH the wounds closed BLOOD POOLS on the
cement floor around his feet

INT GUN and SPORT WORLD - MOMENTS LATER

Trench coat and a shirt back on Michael races along the
ENDLESS RACKS OF GUNS searching for just the right weapons
his every movement precise as if hes trained his whole

for this
Weapon after ferocious weapon gets tossed into rifle bags
Whatever this guys preparing for its big

Rifle bags filled Michael heads for the exit Stops cold
The place is locked up tight Metal gate over the front
doors bars over the windows How the hells he going to
out of here

INT LAPD SQUAD CAR - DRIVING - SAME

Two COPS world weary cruise through downtown Thats
BURTON behind the wheel ESTEVEZ riding shotgun

The POLICE RADIO is ABUZZ WITH ACTIVITY Busy night
Burton stares out at the citys rain soaked denizens with a
deep hatred the shadows looming in doorways the
streetwalkers

BURTON
Goddamn animals Nights like this
I wish I could take a match to this
city just so I could watch all
these motherfuckers burn

ESTEVEZ
(LAUGHS)
A good ol boy barbecue huh
Burton doesnt even smile Hes dead fucking serious
BURTON

A fresh start Thats what this

place needs
He holds his finger up like a pistol Aims it at the people
they pass picking them off one by one

BURTON
Pow Pow Pow
Now Burton laughs a dark mean laugh Estevez eyes his
partner wary
ESTEVEZ
Jesus You know Burton Im so

happy we get to share beautiful

moments like this They really

brighten my da--
KABOOM Through the WINDSHIELD we see a storefront EXPLODE
just ahead raining fiery debris onto the squad car
Burton slams on the breaks and the cops look up just in time
to see

EXT GUN and SPORT WORLD - CONTINUOUS

Michael bulging rifle bags in each hand stepping brazenly
out of the GAPING HOLE hes blown in the front of the store

ESTEVEZ (0S)
Freeze
Estevez and Burton are already out of the squad car
crouching behind the open doors GUNS trained on Michael
ESTEVEZ
Drop the bags Hands on your head
In the distance the POP-POP of GUNFIRE The POLICE RADIO
CRACKLES with URGENT CHATTER MANY VOICES TALKING AT ONCE
Shots firedCode ThreeOfficer down
The cops shift about nervously trying to stay focused
MICHAEL
(sensing their unease)
Its starting There isnt much
time
The cops shoot a quick anxious glance at each other --
what
the hell -- then they turn back to Michael
BURTON
Shut the fuck up and drop the bags
now

Michael lets the gun bags hit the ground

ESTEVEZ
Hands on your head On your head
Michael slowly places his palms on his skull

BURTON
Turn around Turn the fuck around
Michael slowly turns around Calm

Estevez rushes in to restrain Michael grabbing his wrist
MOUTH

FINGERS TIGHTENING Michael closes his eyes a terrible
decision made

And thats when he moves a fucking blur

In an instant Michaels broken the cops arm spinning him
helplessly around turning him into a human shield Now its
Michael whos in charge gun to Estevezs head facing off
with Burton

Burton struggles to find a shot cant

BURTON
Let “‘em go

ESTEVEZ
Take the shot Burton

BURTON
I said let ‘em fuckin g-g-g-g--
Suddenly Burton starts to SHAKE the words stuck in his
throat like a skipping record

ESTEVEZ

Burton
THE STREET LAMPS BEGIN TO FLICKER AND STROBE adding to the
confusion
Burton squeezes his eyes shut in pain his WHOLE BODY
QUAKING heels CLICKING the pavement as if some massive
pressure were building inside him
And with the horrific sound of CRACKING BONES BURTONS

BEGINS TO TWIST INTO AN IMPOSSIBLY WIDE SMILE LIKE A BIZARRE

CLOWN

His eyes SNAP OPEN focused the force inside him now fully
in control

Burton looks at Michael with calm recognition his voice
GUTTURALINHUMAN A man possessed

BURTON
What are you doing Michael These
werent your orders
Estevez looks at his partner with confusion
ESTEVEZ
What did you say
Michael however seems to know exactly who hes talking to

MICHAEL
Im following my own orders now

BURTON
Then you will die along with the
child

ESTEVEZ

Burton you fuckin know this guy
BLAM Burton shoots his partner in the head Estevez drops
leaving Michael without cover Burton re-aims but Michaels
faster already FIRING back
Bullets rip up the concrete SMASH The squad car window
SHATTERS Burtons chest EXPLODING

And down he GOES leaving Michael the only one left
standing

Smoke rising from his gun

With soldier-like efficiency Michael picks up the rifle
bags

and begins to load them into the trunk of the squad car

He gets in the car and FLOORS IT ROARING AWAY as the

FLICKERING STREET LAMPS FINALLY GO OUT IN RAPID SUCCESSION

wave chasing him PLUNGING THE ENTIRE CITY INTO DARKNESS

SMASH CUT TO

JEEP HANSON (LATE TEENS)
Bolts awake Breathing hard Covered with sweat

INT JEEPS ROOM - JUST BEFORE DAWN

Jeep switches on a lamp illuminating this incredibly
cramped

bedroom Not much larger than the bed itself Hes got

shaggy hair a sensitive face clearly not big on sunlight
EXT DESERT - PRE-DAWN

A couple of ancient SILVERSTREAM TRAILERS are bathed in the
eerie blue light of nights final moments It looks like the
trailers havent moved from this patch of barren ground in
decades A single strand of colored Christmas lights dot the
trailers roof lines marking the season

One of the trailer doors CREAKS open and Jeep steps wearily
out into the cool western morning Home

Nothing but desert for miles in all directions save for a
two lane HIGHWAY and a weather beaten TRUCK STOP DINER that
Jeep and his father will open for business in a few hours
Jeep gazes up to the diners slanted roof where a large sign
glows like a beacon in the darkness

PARADISE FALLS GAS ‘N GRUB
A beat as Jeep contemplates the sign

CHARLIE (0S)
You okay Jeep
Jeep turns to see CHARLIE a very pregnant girl of about
twenty standing in the trailer doorway rubbing the sleep
from her eyes Even with the trailer-trash veneer shes
strikingly beautiful

JEEP
Sorry to wake you Charlie

CHARLIE
(stepping out of the
trailer hands on her

BELLY)
Wasnt you Hes been kickin up a
storm all night Must know
somethin I dont
She approaches Jeep Sees the strain in his eyes

CHARLIE
Another bad dream
He struggles for a moment nods
A glimmer

CHARLIE
Its just stress Jeep thats all
You do too much worryin About
this place About your dad

(BEAT)
About me
of a smile crosses Jeeps face

JEEP
Youre the only thing I like
worrying about

CHARLIE
See what I mean Youre worried
about a girl eight months pregnant
and it isnt even your baby Now
thats enough to give anybody
nightmares

Jeep turns away dejected

JEEP
Go ahead make fun of me
Everybody else does

CHARLIE

(turns him back around)
Cmon I was only kiddin You
know how much I appreciate
everything you and Bob are doing
for me but a month from now this
babyll have a new family and Ill
have to start thinkin about what
the hell Im doin with my life

This is not news Jeep wants to hear

JEEP
So youre still going through with
it

CHARLIE
Jeep Im not ready to be a mama
Christ I can barely take care of
myself as it is

JEEP
I could help you We could do it
together you know I want to
Charlie smiles sadly at him touched by his sweetness but
this just isnt where shes at

CHARLIE
You gotta stop carryin the weight
of the world on your shoulders
Jeep nods tries to hide the fact that hes dying inside

CHARLIE
(rubbing her arms)
Now can we go back in Im
freezing my ass off out here

JEEP
Go on Ill be right there
Charlie kisses him on the cheek and heads back to the
trailer He watches her longing in his eyes With the
clank of the door shes gone
And over Jeeps troubled look the perennial holiday cheer
of
FRANK CAPRAS ITS A WONDERFUL LIFE MIXES up

JIMMY STEWART (VO)
I dont know whether I like it very
much being seen around with an
angel without any wings

CUT TO

ITS A WONDERFUL LIFE PLAYING ON A CRUMMY TV

Jimmy Stewart as George Bailey has just met Clarence his
guardian angel-in-training The signal ROLLS and SNOWS in
and out We hear a WHACK which causes the image to
momentarily improve and then slowly roll back the other way

CLARENCE (ON TV)

Oh Ive got to earn them and
youll help me wont you

INT PARADISE FALLS GAS ‘N GRUB - DAY

BOB HANSEN (late 40s) owner and proprietor of this fine
roadside establishment attempts to fix the old TV hanging

the corner above the counter by banging the shit out it

The restaurant itself has the kind of grungy diner charm
youd hope to find in a place last renovated in 1963 An old
plastic Christmas tree strung with flickering lights and
tinsel occupies a lonely corner Next to that a faded
diorama of the NATIVITY SCENE The kind you might order off
the Shopping Network

Bob considers the TV with a frown He deftly rolls an
ENGRAVED SILVER ZIPPO back and forth over the nicotine
stained fingers of his right hand Must be a nervous habit
You can tell just by looking at the man that hes a beer
drinker

Behind the counter a black man named PERCY WALKER (60s) is
cooking up a storm on the grill with spectacular one-handed
dexterity You do get pretty good at this sort of thing when
your other hand has long been replaced by a METAL HOOK

dog tags around his neck tell the story His white cooks
hat has been temporarily replaced by a red Santa hat

PERCY
Lord as my witness Bob one of
these days that things gonna hit

you back
WHACK
BOB
Whaddya talkin about Percy We
got a special relationship here
WHACK

PERCY
Yeah they got names for that kind
a relationship
The JUKEBOX on the other side of the diner starts up with

MERLE HAGGARD tune IM A LONESOME FUGITIVE
A stunning looking sixteen-year-old GIRL with dyed-black

and a piercing or three is leaning seductively over the
jukebox swaying gently to the music The headband doubling
as her mini-skirt reveals her knock-out figure in a way that
really doesnt leave much up to the imagination Shes a
billboard of rebellion

SANDRA (0S)
Its disgusting

HOWARD (0S)
Youre right It is disgusting
Watching the scintillating action from a booth across the
diner is a conservatively dressed SUBURBAN COUPLE SANDRA
and HOWARD ANDERSON Fish out of water

SANDRA
Really how can she go out in
public wearing that

HOWARD
I dont know Why dont we just
ask her

SANDRA
Howard dont Youll embarrass
me

HOWARD

(shouting across the

DINER)

Audrey honey Your mother was

wondering if you got dressed this

morning with the specific intention

of showing your ass off to the

entire world
The girl who we now know as AUDREY ANDERSON turns to Howard
with a caustic smile

AUDREY
Yeah thats cuz I woke up hoping
to get double teamed by a couple of
meth head truckers in the bathroom
of some desert shithole

the

thunder

(BEAT)
Good thing we stopped here
And with that she turns back to the jukebox Percy watches
the exchange discreetly from behind the counter Loving it
Howard turns back to his wife Rigid smile

HOWARD
I feel satisfied with that answer
I really do
Sandra buries her face in her hands

SANDRA
Im being punished for something I
know it

Across the diner Audrey goes back to swaying dreamily to
music which is suddenly overtaken by BASS BUMPIN HIP-HOP

DRIFTING OVER A VAST EXPANSE OF WESTERN DESERT

The noontime sun bakes the strip of highway slicing through
this barren country

A BLACK CADILLAC ESCALADE blazes a path HEAVY BEATS

from within

INT ESCALADE - DRIVING - CONTINUOUS

The stereo in this rig could shake mountains KYLE WILLIAMS
(late 20s) handsome as hell thug style A straight up bad

EXT PARADISE FALLS GAS N GRUB - CONTINUOUS

he Escalade pulls off the highway and rolls to a stop at

onely row of old gas pumps

yle gets out and surveys the scenery with dismay Now in

he daytime we see this is truly a place time forgot
ttached to the diner is a MECHANICS BAY Grease stains and
usty car parts litter the ground Behind the place is the
ILVERSTREAM TRAILER we saw Jeep step out of earlier

he only thing here that looks fairly new is the UHAUL TRUCK

lattens it out on the roof of the car He spins it around
hich way is north

SmATHNK PAnr

KYLE

Darren your fuckin directions

He checks his cell phone again No chance of a signal way
out here So he shuffles around to the side of the diner in
search of a pay phone
The good news is that he finds one The bad news is that
its been broken for ten years
Leaning next to the broken phone however is Charlie

a shabby faded WAITRESS uniform stretched tight around her
very pregnant belly Adding to her perfect mother-to-be look
is that cigarette dangling from her lips The plastic name
tag pinned to her chest says CHARLIE

KYLE
Hey
She eyes him mildly intrigued takes a drag

KYLE
You know that shit right there

She lets out a long slow exhale

CHARLIE

CHARLIE

KYLE

Tell ya what You let me have one

Lights it off the end of hers then hands it to him Kyle
takes a drag pulls out his crumpled map

KYLE

CHARLIE
(peers at the map)
Only if nowheres right ‘cause

JEEP (0S)

They both turn to see Jeep behind the diner wearing
mechanics coveralls and holding a DUSTY OLD CRIB Charlie
quickly hides her cigarette behind her back Busted

CHARLIE
Yeah Im okay This guys just
lost
Jeep nods uncertain eyes Kyle another moment then he
shuffles along out of sight Charlie brings the cigarette
back up to her lips An awkward beat

KYLE
Three seventy-five huh

INT PARADISE FALLS GAS ‘N GRUB - DAY

The DOOR JINGLES Charlie and Kyle enter

Audreys eyes light up when she sees Kyle He notices her as
well How couldnt he Shes directing every ounce of sex
appeal she has in his direction

Her parents on the other hand shoot a look of utter fear

Kyles direction as if he personified their worst suburban
nightmare

Charlie heads to the register Digs out a fresh pack of
smokes from underneath the counter

CHARLIE
I hope Salem Lights are okay
“cause thats all we got left

KYLE
If I can smoke ‘em Ill take ‘em
Bob steps

BOB (0S)
Where ya been Charlie

BOB

In truth there arent any orders stacking up but it
certainly makes Bob feel better to say it

Bob turns

BOB

Kyles handing her)

(gestures to the diner)

KYLE

Bob is about to respond when

HOWARD (0S)
Excuse me

Howard approaches oblivious to the conversation hes
interrupting

HOWARD

Any news about when our truck might
be fixed You said your boy would
have us on the road two hours ago
The rate were going well be
lucky to make it to Scottsdale by
Christmas

Bobs expression darkens at this news

BOB
Goddamn it Where the hell is
Jeep

Cut TO

A GRIMY PIECE OF WOOD

A cloth wipes away the dirt revealing the partial image of
an ANGEL carved into the surface

INT MECHANICS BAY - CONTINUOUS

Jeep is carefully cleaning the old wooden crib on a
workbench Theres an unsettling intensity in his eyes as
if fear itself were driving him

BOB (0S)
Hey Leonardo
Jeep freezes knows hes in trouble He reluctantly turns to
see his father standing next to the Andersons broken-down
Uhual

BOB
The fact that this trucks hoods
up mean anything to you
Jeep stares at the ground Couldnt be anymore
uncomfortable

JEEP
Yeah
BOB
(approaches peering past
him to the crib)

(MORE)

BOB (contd)
Whaddya workin on thats so
goddamn important youre not doin
your job

JEEP
Nothin
Jeep tries feebly to block his path fails
Bob looks down at the crib with dismay

JEEP

Bob considers him softens

BOB
Whaddya doin

JEEP

BOB
Jeep I like Charlie I do And I

your responsibility

JEEP
(heard this before pushes
past him)
Oh whatever leave me alone

BOB

Dont walk away from me while Im
talkin to you

EXT PARADISE GAS ‘N GRUB - CONTINUOUS
Jeep walks out toward the gas pumps but Bobs right
alongside him not giving up

BOB

How long you gonna follow her
around like a puppy dog Cleanin
up the messes she makes while she
steps out with every guy around
here other than you

Jeep stiffens Turns to his father
JEEP
Dont say that about her Shes

Bob gives Jeep a hard stare Yeah she is

BOB
You really think shes gonna stick
around here after that babys born
and off her hands
Jeeps shakes his head burns

JEEP
Look I know it doesnt make any
sense to you but its just
something I have to do
Bob sighs feels for his boy

BOB
(points up at the PARADISE
FALLS sign)

See that up there Your mother

nowhereBut I just knew this was
what I was supposed to do Told

Jeep looks up at his father his words hanging heavily A
tough pill to swallow

BOB

Now get to work on that truck I

wanna have these people on the road

by nightfall
Bob walks back into the diner
Jeep is about to turn back to the garage when he notices
something off in the distance
Ominous DARK CLOUDS line the horizon to the south like a
living wall He shifts his gaze up the highway to the north
Same thing DARK CLOUDS are pushing their way over the
distant mountains A storm is coming

INT PARADISE FALLS GAS ‘N GRUB - SAME

Bob reenters the diner to find Kyle sitting at the counter
digging into a plate of banana pancakes

Kyle is about to address him again when something else
steals Bobs attention

BOB
(holding up a silencing

HAND)
Yeah wait a minute
The TV has gone on the fritz again Only now the image is
mostly snow
Bob climbs back onto the chair Faces the TV
BOB

WHACK
The image flickers but doesnt improve

PERCY

Okay baby this is gonna do it

Bob gives the TV one final wallop -- WHACK
And the picture snaps into FOCUS Only it isnt the
picture

The STARK GRAPHIC OF THE EMERGENCY BROADCASTING SYSTEM and
its accompanying HOLLOW TONE fill the diner
Everybody in the place stops and turns to the TV
BOB

PERCY
Nice work Bob What the hells

BOB
Its just one of those test things
Thatd be true except for the words at the bottom of the
screen which read
THIS IS NOT A TEST
Bob switches the channels All the same
CHARLIE
Dont look like a test

Bob steps off the chair and backs slowly away from the TV as
if a little distance will bring some clarity He bumps into
Kyle
KYLE
Yo am I the Invisible
motherfuckin Man here Do you

Kyle peels a five dollar bill off a serious WAD OF CASH
That gets Bobs attention Bob snaps the money out of his
hand

BOB
In the back past the kitchen Make
it fast
Kyle hustles passed Percy
Charlie is standing by the Andersons table clearing
dishes
Everybodys eyes are locked on the TV

SANDRA
If theres a real emergency arent
they supposed to give us some
information about what to do

HOWARD
Im sure its a mistake

BOB

Hey Percy give that old radio of

yours a shot Maybe they got some

news about the TV
Percy grabs an old battery powered radio off a kitchen

shelf

Switches it on
STATIC He spins the dial until he reaches a clear signal
The same HOLLOW TONE of Emergency Broadcasting Station
after station the same thing
The diner is overwhelmed by a chilling chorus of HOLLOW
TONES Everyone goes very still

KYLE (VO)
Let me talk to him

INT DINER - BACK OFFICE - SAME

Kyle sits at a messy desk in this dark wood paneled back
office phone to his ear

KYLE (CONTD)

INT DINER - SAME
Everyone is looking at Howard
HOWARD

a big one

PERCY
Lot a folks could be hurt

BOB
Not if it was centered in the
desert
HOWARD
Exactly Could be nothing to worry
about

SANDRA
So then whys the TV out

HOWARD
Maybe it just hit the relay
stations Arent those usually in
remote areas

BOB
Yeah ‘cause of the radiation they
give off

PERCY

There aint no radiation comin
from those things Plus that dont
explain the radio being out too
Some of those stations broadcast
over hundreds of miles Any quake
that big and we would a felt it

CHARLIE
Percys right I didnt feel
nothing

AUDREY

Maybe its a terrorist attack or
something

SANDRA
(covers her mouth)
Oh god
Everyone considers that grimly then

BOB
Well for cryin out loud Theres

BOB (contd)
Sides Im sure Jeepll have your
truck fixed up quick as can be and
then youll be on your way

EXT PARADISE FALLS GAS N GRUB - SAME

Jeep is buried under the Uhauls hood working at something
with a socket wrench Its not going well

JEEP
Damn it
He pulls himself up Grease covers his face and hands
The
sound of a CAR APPROACHING catches his attention
He watches as a beat up EIGHTIES CUTLASS SUPREME pulls off
the highway and rolls to a stop at the pumps Its a mystery
how anyone could see through the LAYER OF DUST on that
windshield
After a moment the car door pops open and the LEGS OF AN
ELDERLY WOMAN swing down to the ground followed by the
metal
frame and wheels of a walker
The LITTLE OLD LADY gets out of the car steadies herself on
the walker and then slowly makes her way toward the diner
with the rickety frailness of an old turtle Jeep watches
her disappear inside
He then looks toward the horizon again The WALL OF DARK
CLOUDS are growing ever closer

INT PARADISE FALLS GAS N GRUB - CONTINUOUS

A JINGLE as the old lady enters She surveys the scene as if
feasting on paradise Maybe her eyes arent so good

CHARLIE
Have a seat wherever you want
Maam Specials are on the board

OLD WOMAN
Thank you dear
The old lady settles at a table across from the Andersons
She smiles at them pleasantly

GLADYS

A FLY begins to buzz around Gladyss head

to notice it

SANDRA

TV you know

SANDRA (contd)
And I just was wondering if you
might have heard something on your
way up You know about whats

Gladys smiles strangely

GLADYS

Oh dont worry yourself about

that sweetheart Itll all be

over soon
Sandra nods at the old woman unsure of what to make of that
response
The fly that was circling her head now lands on GLADYSS
FACE It crawls across her cheek without her reacting in the
least
Howard and Sandra exchange looks Creepy
The door JINGLES and Jeep walks in He heads straight for a
quiet huddle with Bob All the while though he keeps one
eye fixed on the old lady sitting at the table near the
Andersons Something about her

JEEP
The carburetors shot Dont know

BOB
(glances over at the

ANDERSONS)
Ah shit Theyre gonna be pissed

JEEP

Charlie rests a hand on her belly

CHARLIE

GLADYS
The father must be very proud

CHARLIE

CHARLIE
Out of sight Out of mind

GLADYS
Oh I see So youre not married

A fly lands on Gladyss steak Charlie tries to wave it
away But another one lands in its place

CHARLIE
Nope
Gladys starts to dig in to the steak with a real
ferociousness you wouldnt expect from an old lady More

FLIES begin to land on her body On her food
Charlie is still trying to wave them away

GLADYS
Thats too bad

CHARLIE
No I prefer it that way I dont
a need a man tellin me what to do

GLADYS
But what about the baby

CHARLIE

GLADYS

Charlie freezes The Andersons turn to look as well Kyle

glances over from the counter
CHARLIE

GLADYS
(all smiles)

Charlie shakes her head at the woman not giving in
CHARLIE
Go to hell lady
She slaps the check down on the table and walks back toward
the kitchen passing Jeep and Bob
BOB
What happened
CHARLIE
Total fucking Jesus freak
Gladys begins to laugh innocently as she continues to devour
her meat Red juice drips down her chin The flies are
swarming now How did so many get in here
Sandra and Howard are mortified at this sudden turn of
events
GLADYS
All those babies Theyre gonna
burn
SANDRA
Gladys please Theres no reason
to --
Gladyss head suddenly whips toward her
GLADYS
Shut up you stupid fucking cunt
All you do is complain Complain
Complain
Sandra covers her mouth in shock Everybody in the diner
is

now focused on the old lady
Howard gets up from the booth

HIS

head

SANDRA
Howard its okay Dont listen to
her
But Howards already standing over Gladys

HOWARD
Who the hell do you think you are
lady Now Id like you to
apologize to my --

GLADYS LUNGES AT HOWARD AND TAKES A MONSTROUS BITE OUT OF

NECK SHE PULLS BACK TO REVEAL A MOUTH FILLED WITH TINY

RAZOR SHARP TEETH

EVERYBODY FREAKS as Howard crumbles to the floor

Gladys rockets to her feet knocking her table over Blood
covers her face and chest

GLADYS
Youre all going to fucking die
Percy is the first to react From behind the counter he
whips a heavy metal frying pan at Gladys that knocks her

sideways THWACK

BONES BREAK AND BURST FROM HER NECK Impossibly Gladys is
still standing

She lets out an INHUMAN SCREAM and SCRAMBLES ACROSS THE
DINER knocking tables and chairs over in her wake

Bob pulls a shotgun from behind the counter

BOB
Dont move
But Gladys not only moves SHE SCURRIES RIGHT UP THE FUCKING

WALL LIKE SOME KIND OF BIZARRE CRAB
Bob cant believe his eyes But he gets over it real fast
as the crab lady rushes toward him -- ACROSS THE CEILING --

UPSIDE DOWN
BOB PUMPS THE SHOTGUN trying to take her down but he cant
track her fast enough Instead he blows ENORMOUS HOLES in
face

his

packing

the ceiling a rain of plaster
Gladys drops down right in front of Bob

BOB
(struggles to cock the

GUN)
Fuck
Gladys smiles sweetly before SLAPPING HIM CLEAR ACROSS THE

ROOM
The shotgun clatters to the floor at Jeeps feet He
snatches it up and aims it at Gladys who turns calmly to

him

PERCY
Shoot her Jeep
Jeeps about to fire when the old ladys EYES GO ALL WHITE

GLADYS
(a sickly sweet smile)
Youll never save her
Jeep freezes stunned by her words overwhelming fear
paralyzing him where he stands

PERCY

SHOOT THE FUCKING BITCH
Gladys rockets straight at him
But Jeeps too afraid to move He clamps his eyes shut
bracing himself for the end

BLAM BLAM BLAM

A RAIN OF BULLETS RIP INTO GLADYS taking her down like an
animal

Jeep slowly opens his eyes His guns still cocked
Gladys lies dead in a smoldering bloody heap at his feet
He turns to see Kyle with smoke rising from the barrel of

silver plated WESTERN ARMS 45 If everyone wasnt so
shocked theyd probably be wondering why this guy is
freely

and

such serious heat

SANDRA (0S)
Somebody help me
Sandra is on the floor with her husband Blood pours

from his neck
Kyle stares at the dying man -- a moment of hesitation --
then he rushes to help

KYLE
Press your hands over the hole
Sandra looks fearfully up at Kyle at the gun still in his
hand

KYLE

Dont look at me like that lady

Im tryin to fuckin help you

Now put your goddamn hands over the

hole before your husband bleeds to

death
Obeying she cups her hands over the hole in his neck
desperately trying to stop the flow of blood leaking out
between her fingers Percy scrambles over with a first-aid
kit and together he and Kyle get to work on Howards neck

A few feet away Charlie helps Bob bruised and bleeding
his feet

BOB
The fuck was that What the fuck

Across the diner Audrey is pushed back into a booth her
knees pulled tightly to her chest shivering Her adult

Bob Charlie and Jeep slowly approach the windows to see the
SOLID UNDULATING BLACK CURTAIN OF FLIES SURROUNDING THE
TRUCK

STOPS PERIMETER A FEW HUNDRED YARDS OUT
Everything in the diner is suddenly cast in DARK RED as the

Apocalyptic

Revealing a bloody mess of muscles and tendons chewed down

Oh god please dont throw up

Howard writhes as Percy pours alcohol on the wound
Sandra cant help but stare at Percys hook
Meanwhile across the diner Bob and Jeep peel back the
tablecloth to examine Gladys bullet riddled corpse Kyle
stands over them with Bobs shotgun trained on the body --
just in case
Gladys is a real horror show Bones jut out at obtuse angles
from her neck -- a result of the blow to her head from
Percys frying pan

BOB
Shes cold as a freakin ice cube

If I hadnt just seen her walk in

here Id say the old bags been

dead for hours
Bob rolls Gladys over revealing her face -- her enlarged
mouth filled with dozens of razor sharp baby teeth

KYLE
Well I dont care how long shes
been dead the bitch aint stayin
in here with us

EXT PARADISE FALLS GAS N GRUB - A FEW MINUTES LATER

Bob Kyle and Jeep quickly drag Gladyss body wrapped in the
plastic table cloth a short ways from the diner They warily
eye the curtain of FLIES no more than a hundred yards out

BOB
I dont get it Why dont they
come closer
KYLE
How the fuck am I supposed to know

behavior of a motherfuckin

A CLANK and Jeep notices the old ladys car keys have
dropped
to the ground
JEEP
(holding up the keys)

GLADYS CUTLASS SUPREME

Its windows are completely caked with dust The men WIPE
AWAY a layer of brown from the glass allowing them to peer
inside the car
BOB
You see anything

KYLE
No Twilight Zone shit if thats

Jeep slips the key into the drivers side door Unlocks
it
BOB
Careful Old lady could have some

hits them
KYLE
Agh What the fuck is that

KYLE

Bob quickly slams the trunk closed The guys are reeling
with disgust

Kyles trying to blow the stench from his nose

KYLE

BOB

was coming from

KYLE
Yeah it was a real motherfuckin
necessity we figured that out man

JEEP
(sees something up the

ROAD)
Hey
They turn to see HEADLIGHTS growing larger in the dim haze
A POLICE CRUISER careens off the highway and skids to a wild
stop in front of the diner Its ENGINE RATTLES as the dust
clears around it No movement can be seen behind its bug
splattered windows

BOB
Okay now were talkin

JEEP
Wait a minute Check it out Its

Kyle hands the shotgun over to Bob

INT PARADISE FALLS GAS N GRUB - SAME
Charlies face lights up when she sees the police car

CHARLIE
Oh thank God the police

EXT PARADISE FALLS GAS N GRUB - CONTINUOUS

The door of the POLICE CAR OPENS as Charlie races from the
diner

The three men see her moving toward the car Jeeps face
goes slack

JEEP
Charlie wait
The men begin to run toward her
While out of the police car steps

MICHAEL

Charlie freezes a few feet from the car when she sees those
piercing eyes already familiar to us Michael looks at her
as if she was exactly who he expected to see

In moments Bob Kyle and Jeep form a protective shield in
front of Charlie Bob raises the shotgun

BOB
Take one step closer and Ill drop
you right here
A long beat as Michael considers Bob Icy cold

MICHAEL
That how you greet all your
customers

BOB
Mister after what weve been
through here today youre lucky we

you later Now let me see your
teeth
Michael stares at him blankly
BOB
Your teeth goddamn it Lemme see

Michael offers up a dangerous smile revealing a not so well
kept but definitely normal set of teeth Bob and the others
ease slightly

JEEP
No shark teeth Pop
Bob lowers the gun

BOB
Okay Suppose you tell us your
name then

MICHAEL
Michael

BOB
Sorry about all that Michael
This old lady just went crazy

by what hes heard

BOB

So what are you doin out here

Gotta say you dont exactly look

like a police officer Even one

from LA Then again you have to

be right I mean who the helld

be crazy enough to steal a cop car
Bob chuckles for a moment When Michael doesnt respond in
kind Bob falls silent Anxious He slowly raises the
shotgun again
Michael sizes up this raggedy group His gaze drifts over to
the loosely wrapped body in front of the diner The plastic
table cloth flaps wildly in the wind Turning back to Bob

MICHAEL
You dont know do you

KYLE
Know what

CHARLIE
We dont know anything Nothings

the phone
Michael just shakes his head

MICHAEL
Im running out of time
Michael steps toward Charlie with a sense of purpose
Bob
blocks his path brandishing the shotgun

BOB
Back off fella

(BEAT)
Now I dont care if this is the
second coming of Jesus fucking
Christ I say its time for you to
either get talkin or get the hell
outta here

but

In a BLUR OF MOVEMENT Michael rips the shotgun from Bobs
hands It all happens so fast that Bob is stunned to find

himself holding air

Hes even more stunned to now have the barrel of the gun

pressed to the bridge of his nose Everyone freezes

KYLE
Easy Easy
Michaels expression is totally calm Merciless

JEEP
Cmon Dad tell ‘em youre sorry
Tell ‘em you were only kidding

But Bob cant even speak hes so scared He squeezes his

eyes closed

CHARLIE
Let “‘em go

Michaels eyes flit momentarily in Charlies direction

Considering her

The diner door opens and Percy steps cautiously out with

hand

and hook held up to show no threat Hes followed by Sandra

and Audrey
Michael sees them but offers no indication that he cares

PERCY
Now son Im sure you dont wanna

(BEAT)

So whaddya say “bout just lettin

But Michael doesnt seem to register this plea Its not
looking good
No one BREATHES Thats when Kyle notices something out in
the direction of the road

DOZENS OF TINY HEADLIGHTS APPEARING IN THE DARK HAZE
APPROACHING

KYLE
What the--
Michael turns sees the lights

MICHAEL
Theyre here
Michael whips the gun away from Bobs head and thrusts it
back into his hands Bobs looks down at the gun
speechless

MICHAEL
Youre going to need this
Michael walks swiftly around to the trunk of the cruiser
Pops it revealing a staggering ARSENAL OF WEAPONRY

HE BEGINS TO LOAD GUN AFTER GUN
Percy stares out at the lights eyes wide

PERCY
Lord have mercy
(waving back Audrey and
SANDRA)
You ladies best get back inside

SANDRA
What is it Whats happening Who
is this man Whys he driving a
police car

AUDREY
Shut up mom

Audrey pulls her mother back into the diner

Michael hands an MP5 SUB-MACHINE GUN to Kyle Another one
goes to Percy Finally he places a third one in Jeeps
hands who stares down at it anxiously

BOB
Wait I dont think thats such a
good idea

JEEP
Dad I can handle it

BOB
(to Michael)
Hes just a kid --

JEEP
I said I can handle it
Michaels eyes narrow studying Jeep

MICHAEL
He can handle it He doesnt have
a choice
Michael pulls out twin MP5s for himself GLOCK 9s are tucked
everywhere they can go Michael tosses clip belts to the
men Boxes of shotgun shells The works

MICHAEL
If you want to live youll do
exactly as I say
He slams the trunk closed and approaches Charlie He cocks
Glock and hands it to her

MICHAEL

When you fire you keep your thumb

off the slide Dont hesitate

Dont do anything brave Theres

no safety
He gives her a hard look She nods nervously Trusting

him

but not sure why
Michael marches into the diner Kyle glances quickly at the
others then he bolts after Michael
Percy follows Then Charlie
Now its only Jeep and his father left

BOB
Cmon Jeep We gotta go

And Bob rushes into the diner
A moment as Jeep looks out toward the road

THE HEADLIGHTS ARE GROWING BRIGHTER CLOSER
He contemplates the sub-machine gun in his hands

JEEP
Fuck it
And races after his father

Shes running her hands gently through his hair trying to

A hatch opens and out comes Michael followed by Bob Percy
and Kyle They quickly take their places behind the
Paradise sign Pitch black surrounds them

The RUMBLE OF ENGINES is gone leaving only the RUSH OF THE
WIND coming up off the desert

Where the hell did they go
Bob turns to Michael sharply

BOB
Alright Rambo You got us up
here Now you mind explaining what
the fuck were fighting
Michael is about to answer when

PERCY
Listen
Over the wind another sound becomes audible
The delicate chime of a CALLIOPE

PERCY
You hear what Im hearing

BOB
YeahThe hell is that
The CALLIOPE MUSIC grows louder the melody more distinct
Now we recognize the song SANTA CLAUS IS COMING TO TOWN
But instead of filling them with cheer it fills them with
dread

PERCY
It sounds almost like

KYLE
Ice cream
TWO HEADLIGHTS appear in the darkness And sure enough an
ICE CREAM TRUCK rolls slowly toward the diner The EERIE
CALLIOPE MUSIC emanates from a speaker on its roof Its

dark to see whos behind the wheel

KYLE
Youve got to be fuckin kidding

MICHAEL
Alright Theres a safety switch
on the side of your gun Push it
all the way down Two clicks
The men quickly do as theyre told

MP5 trying to assume a tough guy posture If only he could
stop shaking it might be believable

Charlie and Audrey peer between the slats covering the
windows The ICE CREAM TRUCKS HEADLIGHTS fan across the
diner

Audrey and Charlie back away from the windows

Charlie stops next to Jeep Senses him shaking Rests a
hand on his arm And that seems to helpa little

Howard smiles weakly at the familiar sound of the CALLIOPE

HOWARD

Oh honey listen Its the Ice
Cream Man

EXT PARADISE FALLS GAS N GRUB - ROOF - SAME

The Ice Cream Truck pulls to a stop with its headlights
facing the diner

Everyone aims their guns at the truck Tense
From the Ice Cream Trucka DARK BLOODY SHOE STEPS to the
ground
MOVING up the long grey pant leg spotted with blood stains
to
reveal a skeletally thin man in tattered coveralls Say
hello to THE ICE CREAM MAN
He looks like hes been through hell -- literally As he
steps into the beams of the headlights we can see him even
more clearly
Hes tall Too tall His clothes dont seem to fit him
And hes unnaturally thin as if hes been stretched like
taffy If he got down on all fours you might mistake him
for some kind of spider He surveys the diner the garage
the roof -- assessing the situation
On the roof the men wait for something to happen
KYLE
(WHISPERS)
Ah he dont look that bad
The Ice Cream Mans gaze snaps up to the roof He
heard
KYLE
Oh shit Oh shit Oh shit

Thats when the Ice Cream Mans JAW UNHINGES STRETCHING

TORTUROUSLY DOWN TO NEARLY THE MIDDLE OF HIS CHEST ROW
AFTER ROW OF A RAZOR SHARP TEETH FORM with the sickening
sound of CRACKING OF BONES
From his new mouth the Ice Cream Man lets out an earth
shattering HOWL
Everyone except Michael is practically hyperventilating with
fear

MICHAEL
Get ready
And the ICE CREAM MAN BOLTS for the diner with STARTLING
SPEED His movements arent at all like those of a normal
man but rather like some kind of HUMAN INSECT
Michael aims

continues

BLAM BLAM BLAM

Bullets rip into the creatures body knocking him flat on
his back Still Arms and legs in a twisted twitching
mess

Michael keeps his aim Waits The CALLIOPE music

to play

Percy tosses him a box of shells But Bob fumbles the catch
and the box slides halfway down the sloped roof

With the gun still in one hand Bob reaches frantically down
for the ammo Stretching Further

A HIDEOUSLY WOUNDED MIDDLE-AGED HOUSEWIFE CATAPULTS UP FROM
BELOW THE ROOFLINE Her hair must have been in curlers
before most of it BURNED AWAY Her nightdress hangs in
tatters off her body Her jaw CLICKS RAPIDLY as she
clatters up at Bob like a GIANT INSECT

Bob tries to pull back but he has no traction and he starts
to slip down toward her Shes coming fast

Percy sees his friend in trouble

Bob swings the shotgun like a club -- CRACK -- knocking the
bitch clear off the roof But the move has made his slide
even faster He drops the shotgun trying to hold on but he
cant stop

BOB IS ABOUT TO HIT THE EDGE WHEN THE HORRID WOMAN POPS UP

RIGHT IN FRONT OF HIM
She doesnt even have a chance to react as Bob does

akin to a swimmers push right off her body WHAM
The creature goes flying back off the roof and the opposing
force halts Bobs slide

on

with the women in the way he cant get a clear shot So he
discards the gun and grabs Howards arms
Howard screams as his body is torturously stretched A

tug-of-war
ON HOWARDS FEET -- TWO MORE SETS OF SINEWY MUSCLE AND BONE

CLAWS REACH THROUGH THE WINDOW AND GRAB HIS LEGS
Howards body lurches further out the window

SANDRA
Howard
Howards torso is almost entirely out the window Charlie
daringly reaches for Howards belt desperate to gain
leverage

ANOTHER DISFIGURED HAND PUNCHES THROUGH THE BLINDS AND LOCKS

ONTO CHARLIES ARM

Charlie screams as shes yanked painfully toward the window
losing her grip on Howards belt

Through the broken window she sees the face of a RAGGEDY
LOOKING MAN He smiles at her like a father coming home to

longer

the

his baby girl
RAGGEDY MAN

(SWEETLY)
There you are
And he starts to pull her arm even harderOther creatures
suddenly notice her as well focusing their attack as if she
alone was their target
Jeep immediately lets go of Howard and dives for Charlie
grabbing her free arm just before shes pulled through

Without the help Audrey and Sandra cant hold on any

Howard is ripped from of his familys hands and out the
window

Only a few more inches separate Charlie and certain death
through the window Jeeps losing her

A FLASH OF STEEL SCHING

Charlie and Jeep fall back into the diner the claw like
hands still grasping Charlies arm no longer attached to
their owners
Michael leaps over her a butchers knife in one hand a
machine gun in the other He lights up everything in his
path The window blinds become a WALL OF FIRE Creatures
SCREECH and flee into the night having successfully taken
their first victim

Charlie flings the severed appendages off her and she and
Jeep scoot away from the window

Hysterical Sandra tries to push past Michael Shes going
after Howard He intercepts her before she can make it out

SANDRA
Let me go Hes alive
Sandra slaps at him frantically as he carries her away from
the window and thrusts her down into a back booth

SANDRA
Hes alive
MICHAEL

Sandra breaks down

As Charlie climbs slowly to her feet -- a sudden pain
She

clutches her belly Winces
Jeep catches her arm to steady her

CHARLIE

She glances back at Michael Hes watching her
Those eyes

DETERMINED)

MICHAEL

Bob stares at Michael uncertain how to respond to that

PERCY

CHARLIE
He brings them here and then he

Audrey hesitantly approaches Michael

AUDREY
So youre here to protect us

MICHAEL

(looks at Charlie)
Her
Charlie reacts in shock as all eyes are suddenly on her

CHARLIE
Me Why me

MICHAEL
Because your child is the only hope
humanity has of surviving
In response to that Charlie does the only thing someone can
do when told such a thing She LAUGHS

CHARLIE
No way
But Michael isnt joking and Charlies laughter becomes
genuine fear

CHARLIE

(STUNNED)

Jeep stares at Charlie as if suddenly his entire life is
starting to make sense

JEEP

Charlie sways on her feet Jeep rests a hand on her
shoulder steadying her
With a CLANK Michael re-arms his weapon turns to the group
with finality

MICHAEL
If you want to live youll do what

test of our strength The next one

Something much worse is on its way
Everyone exchanges terrified looks Finally Kyle steps
forward
KYLE

Bob plays with his trusty zippo with one hand and grills up
some steaks with the other He pauses in his cooking every
few moments to take a slug from a can of beer Cant get it
down fast enough

Sandra sits at the counter across from him staring at a
prescription bottle tipped in front of her pills spread
around

Bob glances over sees the devastation in her eyes He pulls
another can of beer from underneath the counter pops it and
places it in front of her

BOB

Sandra takes another sip of beer Considers it

SANDRA

Never much cared for beer

Howards the beer drinker in the

The moment the words leave her mouth the grief hits her
again She gathers up some pills from the counter tosses
them back and downs her beer like theres no tomorrow This
is a battle shes losing

Meanwhile in a booth across the diner Audrey is fiddling

Up at the front of the diner Jeep silently helps Michael
nail broken table planks across the shattered window He
eyes the strange tatoos running down Michaels arms the two
jagged wounds visible above his shirt line

JEEP

Michael considers the question a beat then

MICHAEL

He lost faith I hadnt

MICHAEL

Michael and Bob are tying Sandra to a chair Not like it
looks like shes capable of going anywhere but you never
know

Across the diner Charlie eyes Michael cautiously Michael
never goes for more than a few moments without looking up at
her Its not lecherous More like a protective father
making sure his child hasnt strayed too far

In a booth Audrey watches red-eyed as Michael restrains
her mother Then she returns her attention to Percys radio
Tuning Trying to find something anything in the STATIC

She brings her ear up close Wait Is that a VOICE
She adjusts the antenna trying to bring the signal into
focus CLEARER

AUDREY
Hey
CLEARER Yes Its a VOICE
AUDREY

Hey You guys I think I got

something here
Everyone drops what theyre doing and quickly gathers around
the radio

THROUGH THE HAZE OF STATIC A GRAVELY TIRED VOICE
BEYOND BELIEF BUT STILL BROADCASTING

RADIO VOICE
battling has been fierce The
numbers of casualties are unknown
but all indications are that they
must be unimaginably large

If youre just joining us were
getting some of the first bits of
good news if you can call it that
since this apocalypse began just
twenty-four ago A human militia
has formed on the outskirts of Las
Vegas and has begun to engage the
enemy Also down in the Four
Corners area weve been receiving
unconfirmed reports of another
resistance force gathering in Red
Rock National in the northern
Mojave Desert area

the highway from here

AUDREY
Does that mean we can leave

MICHAEL
No Were not going anywhere

BOB
What the hell are you talkin
about This is our chance

MICHAEL
We cant risk being on the move
when the child comes Its too
dangerous

Bob looks over at Charlie defeated She shakes her head
anger building She sweeps some plates off the counter and
races for the bathroom

And as we fight this new
enemy may God give us the strength
to survive and show mercy for those
of us who are already lost

INT DINER BATHROOM - NIGHT

Charlie stands at the sink cigarette to her lips water
running stealing a private moment She takes a deep drag
feels the smoke filling her lungs defiant

Then she catches a look at herself in the mirror runs her
hand along the curvature of her belly Tears well up in her
eyes fear and anger overtaking her

She stamps out the cigarette in a fit of frustration

INT DINER - A SHORT WHILE LATER

Its quiet DRIFTING past sleeping figures to find Charlie
wide-awake sitting at a booth lost in thought

JEEP (0S)
Guess its your turn not to sleep
Charlie looks up to see Jeep sit down across from her

CHARLIE
Hey
Jeep sees the strain on her face

JEEP
You okay
CHARLIE
You mean besides the fact that I
just found out that Im the mother
of the Messiah
Jeep smiles nods

CHARLIE

Crazy thing isI didnt want this
baby I even went down to the
clinic you know that

(off Jeeps reaction)
I remember sitting there in the
waiting room absolutely sure I was
doin the right thingAnd thats
when the feeling started Like I
was falling into the deepest
darkest hole imaginable I
couldnt breathe I couldnt speak
I kept thinking this must be what
death is like And when finally
they called my name I ran

(BEAT)
For a while after that I tried
pretending that it was just cold
feet that I could go back if I
wanted to that I could decide to
end it like Id planned Then Id
start to have that feeling again
and I knew I didnt have a choice
Somehow this had already been
decided And it made me hate this
thing thats been growing inside
me
A long beat as Jeep considers her then

JEEP
You shouldnt say things like that
Charlie It isnt right Youll
get through this I know you will
She turns to him the bitterness overtaking her

CHARLIE
How come you have so much faith in
me Jeep God knows Ive never
given you or anybody else a reason
to Or is it that you just cant
find any other hard-luck case to
follow around
Jeeps face hardens He gets up Hurt Frustrated

JEEP
You know youre not the only whos
suffered okay Let me know when
you stop feeling sorry for
yourself
And with that Jeep walks away leaving Charlie to stare
after him disturbed and surprised by his response

EXT PARADISE FALLS GAS N GRUB - ROOF - LATE AFTERNOON

Sand and wind The INVISIBLE SUN is sinking
Kyle and Audrey are bundled together on the roof keeping
watch Kyle is showing her how to hold the MP5

KYLE
Then you just flip this --
Audrey flips the safety

AUDREY
Yeah I got it All the way down
Two clicks
She points the gun out into the haze like shes been holding
one all her life
Off Kyles surprised look

AUDREY
Dated this guy last summer A
marine Had a thing for guns
Parents hated him

KYLE
I bet they did
After a moment Audrey switches the safety back on Hands

the gun over to Kyle
Audrey stares into the red nothingness surrounding them Her
expression growing distant She seems to have aged years

brilliant

overnight

AUDREY
My parents hate everything I do
Thats why we were moving

KYLE
Yeah

AUDREY

They thought a more wholesome
environment would help me change
my ways So fucked up Only
reason they care at all is cuz they
dont want to be embarrassed in
front of their friends at the
country club

Kyle considers her thoughtfully

KYLE
The only time my old man ever paid
attention to me was when I was
doing somethin bad So you know
what I did

AUDREY
What
KYLE
I got really good at being bad
She smiles at this confession Can obviously relate He
wipes a tear from her cheek
She leans in Kisses him Passionately Desperately

His hands trace over her body

She claws at him Her passion growing out of control

Shes practically devouring him Kyle can barely keep up
Its like something else beyond sensual need has taken over
She moves down his chest Further Kyle leans his head
back Further

Just then the SPOT LIGHTS that illuminate the roof sign come
to life The young couple stops to look up at the

red word Paradise illuminated above them

Down below the gas pumps LIGHT UP The stations
FLUORESCENTS flicker on

The electric fan spins on above the grill

Jeep and Michael move to look through the slats at the
window

Charlie is giving Sandra some water through a straw

Bob wanders in squinting at the sudden presence of light

BOB

MICHAEL
I dont think so

EXT PARADISE FALLS GAS N GRUB - ROOF - SAME

dramatic change

AUDREY
No I can handle it
Kyle stares at Audreys beautiful determined face Then

pulls out his silver 45

KYLE
(handing her the gun)
Just in case
The headlights become a FAMILY MINIVAN careening wildly off
the highway to stop at the pumps

KYLE
Get ready
They aim their weapons at the vehicle
A well dressed MAN in his mid-thirties jumps out of the car
He looks around nervously scared Then seeing that the
coast is clear he offers a calming wave to his WIFE and
YOUNG BOY who wait anxiously for him inside the car

He races around to the gas pump

KYLE
(lowering his gun)
Wait a minute

AUDREY
Kyle are they
A distant SCREECH from behind Kyle and Audrey spin to look
out over the back side of the diner
AN ARMY OF DARK SHAPES are swarming in fast
Kyle looks urgently back at the family The father lifts

pump Flips the lever

KYLE
Its a trap They saw them coming
and turned on the lights Its a
fucking trap
Kyle and Audrey wave their arms frantically at the family

KYLE AND AUDREY
Hey Get back in your car Its a
trap

everything

But down below the man can only hear the sound of RAGING
WIND as he pumps the gas

Kyle fires his gun in the air BLAM BLAM BLAM
At the sound of gunfire the man looks quickly up to the
roof His family heard it too and they start to SCREAM TO

HIM The man can only see silhouettes in this light but
hes not waiting around to see if its friend or foe
Audrey watches in horror as the dark shapes reach the diner

AUDREY
Theyre not gonna make it
The father dashes to the drivers side He throws open

door

But hes too late He looks over his shoulder just in time
to see a BLUR OF MOVEMENT RUSHING AT HIM

His BLOOD PAINTS the car windows

Kyle raises his MP5 to fire upon the dark shapes that
surround the vehicle like swarming insects

The wife and boy scream hysterically as they are torn from
the vehicle by skeletal hands

AUDREY
(pushing his barrel down)
Wait Youll hit them too
So Kyle makes a desperately courageous play He leaps onto
the roofs sloped overhang -- sliding fast -- he drops to

ground in front of the diner
AUDREY

Kyle charges the dark mob Creatures peel away from the
woman and boy to confront Kyle head-on

He lets loose with a rain of bullets eviscerating

that comes at him

MICHAEL

could all be dead

EXT PARADISE FALLS GAS N GRUB - SAME

The Possessed move in from all sides but Kyle is remarkably
agile dropping one after another in a stunning display

He closes in on the family blasting back the creatures
huddled around them

He finds the YOUNG BOY curled up with his hands protectively
covering his face

Kyle swoops down and gathers the boy into his arms

KYLE
I got you
Kyle moves on to the mother But something odd is happening
The creatures have stopped coming at him
In fact theyre just standing there watching him

Kyle freezes CLOSE ON HIM as he senses something terribly
wrong

Out the window they see Audrey drop down from the roof and
run towards Kyle

The young boy stands over Kyle silently watching the life
drain from his body

The boy looks up to see Audrey approaching fast Tears
suddenly appear in his eyes He opens his arms pleadingly to
her

YOUNG BOY

Fuck you
Audrey raises the 45 and CLICK CLICK CLICK

She keeps pulling the trigger Nothing
The boys tears stop instantly He looks at her with an
eerie calm for someone so young

The boy moves toward Audrey stepping over Kyles body
Audrey backs away She looks toward the entrance to the
diner Blocked by advancing creatures
Theyre everywhere Shes trapped
She notices the open door to the MINIVAN And so she

The sound of CHARLIES SCREAM carries us to

INT PARADISE FALLS GAS N GRUB - LATE NIGHT

Charlie drenched in sweat is writhing on the ground with
Michael holding down her arms and Audrey kneeling between

legs Pots of steaming water surround them

AUDREY

Bob hears the spite in Jeeps voice

BOB
Jeep sooner or later shell

JEEP

BOB

Cant a father be wrong sometimes
Jeep considers Bob with a smile then comes the sound
A DEEP LONG BODY RUMBLING TONE rising up off the plain
if emanating from the largest HORN ever constructed

JEEP
What was that
The SPECTRAL LIGHTS dot the landscape now with untold
numbers

INT PARADISE FALLS GAS N GRUB - CONTINUOUS

Michael reacts to the sound An urgency comes over him
Audrey arrives with more steaming water

EXT PARADISE FALLS GAS N GRUB - ROOF - SAME

Jeep and Bob watch helplessly as the ARMY OF CREATURES has
closed within a hundred yards of the diner Their ranks
stretch back seemingly without end into the darkness

JEEP

Bob looks at his son The agony stretched across his face

BOB
Im sorry Jeep This shouldnt be
happening to you

Jeep rests a comforting hand on his fathers shoulder Bob
pulls his son close and hugs him with all his might tears
filling his eyes

INT PARADISE GAS N GRUB - SAME

Amidst the dirt and darkness Charlie lets out a final
agonizing SCREAM

and then comes a BABYS CRIES Audrey eyes wide holds
up the CHILD Stunned Elated

AUDREY
Oh my godwe did it Charlie

Audrey places the child in Charlies arms She stares at the
baby holding it at a distance unsure of whether to embrace
it or be terrified by it A commitment shes not yet ready
to make even at this late hour

AUDREY

(CONFUSED )
Its okay The babys okay
Charlie looks to Audrey tears streaming down her face

CHARLIE

Audrey looks to Michael unsure

MICHAEL
Take him Give her a minute
Audrey nods takes the baby back from Charlie tries to
soothe him by pacing around the diner

AUDREY
Its okayIts okayShhh
Another DRONE OF THE HORN RATTLES THE WALLS Menacing

Closer
Audrey reacts crosses to the counter turns on the radio
trying to drown out the sound of the approaching menace
stares

of the STATIC the haunting sounds of BING CROSBY singing
SILENT NIGHT fills the room The quiet before the storm
Michael helps Charlie quickly clean herself up She

at him a burning spite in her eyes

CHARLIE
So are we safe now Is it over

MICHAEL
No Killing the child would have
ended the war before it had begun
Now at least he will have a
chance to grow up a chance to lead
the world out of darkness
Those words provide her little comfort

CHARLIE
And what happens until then

MICHAEL
Youll need to teach him how
Charlie shakes her head this is all too much

CHARLIE
What makes you think I can do that
What makes you think I want to do
that If hes so important why
dont you take him

MICHAEL

Each of us has a burden This one

is yours and yours alone Maybe

someday youll understand what that

means
Off Charlies look we move across the diner where Audrey
approaches her mother kneels down in front of her Despite
how much her mother pisses her off it breaks her heart to
see her in such a demoralized state

AUDREY
Mama Can you hear me
(holds up the baby)
We did itThe babys alive

AUDREY (contd)

Mama
If Sandra hears her daughter it doesnt show in her face
Tears well up in Audreys eyes as she moves away from her
mother But we HOLD here and
DRIFT DOWN BEHIND THE CHAIR TO REVEAL Sandras hands are
loosening the bonds BLOOD TRICKLES from where the ropes
cut through her skin

EXT PARADISE FALLS GAS N GRUB - SAME

DRIFTING THROUGH the dark shapes as the BABYS CRIES
reverberate up and down the ranks They begin to look about
frantically agitated by the sound Some even begin to back
away from the diner

DISSOLVE TO

EXT DESERT - CONTINUOUS

Off in the distance the diner is but a dim flickering light
above the plain It could almost be mistaken for a stable in
a desert town a long time ago

THREE STARS burn bright and low in the black sky

All around us the DARK CREATURES are cowering from sound of
the CRYING INFANT whose wails seem to grow even LOUDER the
further away from the diner we get

HIGH ABOVE THE TRUCK STOP

In the darkness below we see the lights of the legions of
creatures dot the landscape and at the center of it all the
truck stop

The sound of WINGS BEATING AGAINST THE WIND

AND WERE DRIFTING DOWN TOWARD THE DINER ENTRANCE LIKE A

BIRD CIRCLING ITS PREY

INT PARADISE FALLS GAS N GRUB - SAME

Jeep and Bob enter the diner to see Michael helping Charlie
to her feet while Audrey continues to pace the bundle of

bloody blankets cradled in her arms

JEEP
Somethings happening Theyre
moving away

MICHAEL
The Possessed cant come near the
child so He sent someone that can
Someone like me

BOB
Who
MICHAEL
Gabriel My lieutenant Hes come

to do what I wouldnt
ON JEEP as the realization hits him

JEEP
Your orders
Michael looks at Jeep

JEEP
You were the one who was supposed
to kill the baby That was the
order you didnt obey
Michael nods grimly Charlie looks urgently at Michael

CHARLIE
Whats he talking about
The baby CRIES LOUDER

CHARLIE
Michael what the hells he talking
about

MICHAEL

There was never meant to be a
Second Coming But weve just
changed that The child lives
The future is unwritten Theres
still hope

Charlie shaken by this revelation reaches out to Audrey

CHARLIE
Audrey
Audrey moves to hand over the baby to Charlie

AND THATS WHEN SANDRA SPRINGS OUT OF HER CHAIR AND

SNATCHES THE BABY FROM AUDREYS ARMS
Sandra backs away from them moving toward the front door
Hers is the face of madness

SANDRA
Stay away from me Dont come any
closer

AUDREY
Mom

BOB

Dont do it lady

SANDRA
You heard what he said They just
want the baby Maybe if we just
give it to them then theyll let
us go
Michael cocks his gun Points it at Sandra

THE HORN BLARES ONCE MORE DEAFENING SHAKING EVERYTHING IN

THE DINER ITS RIGHT OUTSIDE THE DOOR
Charlie squares off with Sandra panic in her eyes

CHARLIE
Give him to me

SANDRA
Why You never wanted him in the
first place
Charlie stares at her in horror the truth of those words
rattling her to the very core
CHARLIE
No I
Sandra is almost to the front door

SANDRA
Its just one baby Just one

CRASH THE DOOR IS TORN OFF ITS HINGES

A brilliant SPECTRAL LIGHT pours into the diner

Sandra is blinded She raises a hand to block the light
And thats when Michael fires BLAM

Sandra staggers back blood dripping from the hole in her
forehead and

THE BABY GOES FLYING OUT OF HER HANDS
Charlie screams and the WORLD MOVES INTO SLOW MOTION

And

everything suddenly goes very QUIET

Michael fires again Blowing Sandras body back through
the

doorway

Jeep watches the baby sail SLOWLY through the air

he time for Jeep to act is now

Jeep DIVES for the babycatching the bundle of rags mere
inches from the ground And then he looks up to see

he dark SILHOUETTE OF A MAN approaching from out of the
spectral light A MAN WITH WINGS

Jeeps eyes grow wide as the FIERCE ANGEL steps into the
diner But this looks like no angel weve seen before

his is a creature built for war Rough hewn battle
scarred His body armor making him appear disturbingly
insect like His wings are not feathery or gentle Rather
they are hard mechanical an organic machine

he angels wings retract with clockwork-like precision
And now that we see the his face clearly we notice his
striking resemblance to Michael We might even mistake them
for brothers

His name is GABRIEL

Gabriel raises a massive ferocious strangely mechanical
looking MACE in his powerful hands

And the world returns to NORMAL SPEED as Gabriel brings the
mace arcing down at Jeep

Jeep rolls CLANG The weapon just misses him hitting the

-

launching

around

face

the

floor in a spray of sparks literally CRACKING THE GROUND

Gabriel brings the mace up again Jeep wont be so lucky
twice
BOB (0S)
Sonuvabitch

Bob charges at the creature sub-machine gun blazing
Gabriel reacts by instantly UNFOLDING HIS WINGS and

himself into the air The bullets clawing up the wall behind
him

But Bobs heroic move has given Jeep time to get up and run
with the baby for the back of the diner He thrusts the
child into Charlies hands And without even thinking she
pulls the child protectively to her chest

Gabriel drops down in front of Bob whipping his wings

like a deadly RAZOR SHARP FAN
Bob stops firing a look of surprise stretches over his

His gun falling from his hands
Blood begins to pour out of the slice across his belly

JEEP
No
With a sweep of his hand Gabriel sends Bob flying across

diner where he crashes down behind the counter near the
stove

Michael GRABS JEEPS HAND before the boy can rush back into
the fray

MICHAEL
No Jeep You must protect the
child now

JEEP
Me What about you

MICHAEL
My path ends here You are the
true protector You always have
been
Jeep shakes his head panic setting in

JEEP
But I dont know what to do

MICHAEL
Find the Prophets Learn to read
the instructions
Michael lets go of Jeeps hand and turns away to face
Gabriel leaving Jeep to contemplate those final words

JEEP

Prophets What Prophets What

instructions
And thats when Jeep opens his hand to find the KEYS to
Michaels Police Cruiser
Jeep looks up from the keys to see Charlie Audrey and the
baby The responsibility crashing in on him Then he closes
his hand around the keys determination building

JEEP
Cmon

Charlie looks past Jeep to see Michael returning to the

fray
CHARLIE
Wait We cant leave him
JEEP
We have no choice We have to get
to Red Rock
He pulls Charlie past the counter toward the back office
Jeep stops when he sees his fathers broken body lying on
the

ground by the stove in a pool of his own blood

Bobs half open eyes focus on his son In his outstretched
hand is that goddamn ZIPPO LIGHTER and next to that a
BROKEN GAS PIPE leading to the stove

Jeep is terrified

JEEP
Dad
Jeep tries to help him up

BOB

Leave me Jeep My place is here
remember

JEEP
But Dad

Bob smiles weakly at his son and says simply

BOB
Run
And so Jeep fighting back tears does what his father says

INT PARADISE FALLS GAS N GRUB - BACK OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Audrey and Jeep push the desk away from the door
Charlie opens it Sand swirls in around her
And Jeep leads the trio out the door

INT PARADISE GAS N GRUB - SAME

Michael and Gabriel square off in the diner not like
enemies but like brothers on opposite sides of a terrible
family conflict

MICHAEL
I knew hed send you Gabriel You
were always so eager to please Him

GABRIEL
Unlike youthe rebellious son
(noticing Michaels scars)
Pity about your wings They would
have helped you now

MICHAEL
To not feel their burdenis a
dream

GABRIEL
You think you can defy Him and not
pay the price

MICHAEL
The child lives What happens to
me doesnt matter now

GABRIEL
Yours is a fools sacrifice You
can help them sneak out the back
door but they wont escape

(BEAT)
And neither will you brother
Michael slowly approaches Gabriel

MICHAEL

(SOFT)
Im not running anymore
Gabriel hesitates doubt clouding his face This was not
what he was expecting

MICHAEL

(SENSING)
Join with me You dont need do
this Theres another way
A beat then Gabriels expression hardens

GABRIEL
There is no other way

He pulls back from Michael raising the mace -- SCHING --

LONG DEADLY SHARP SPIKES BURSTS FROM ALL ITS SIDESas if
it

wasnt bad-ass enough

And the fight begins

Its mace against machine gun and strangely enough it seems

under Gabriels deft control the mace is the vastly
superior

weapon
With the aid of his wings Gabriel moves with staggering
speed defying gravity to avoid the rain of bullets The
jabs

Michael

place is getting absolutely shot to hell

Michael leaps from table top to table top as Gabriel brings
the mace brutally down -- splintering everything it touches
Michael leaps onto the last unbroken table top -- spins to
fire Gabriel pushes into the air jabbing a spike straight
into the barrel of Michaels MP5 The gun explodes in
Michaels hands sending him rocketing backwards where he
lands on the counter
Gabriel swoops in fast Michael kicks him in the chest
sending him fluttering back
Michael thrusts himself to his feet Gabriel recovers

again
Michael grabs a hold of Bobs ceiling mounted TV for support
and lifts his body just above the deadly spike
Michael kicks Gabriel in the head momentarily stunning him
Michael dives at Gabriel landing an awesome flurry of
punches
Gabriel is rattled back by the assault He clumsily lifts
his mace and thrusts with it
Michael narrowly evades the razor point which drives into a
wall
Michael smashes down on Gabriels wrist CRACKING the bones
A swift kick to the chest and Gabriel is thrust crashing
back losing his grip on the weapon

Michael takes a running leap onto Gabriels back

Gabriel launches wildly into the air trying to throw

off They hit the ceiling but Michael hangs on Choking
the life out of Gabriel

He grabs it holding it futilely in front of him From this

Blood pours from a huge hole in Michaels chest Right

somewhere in the diner

Gabriel moves gracefully through the destroyed diner toward
the source of the CLICKING

He steps behind the counter and finds Bob lying in a massive
pool of blood

It takes the creature a moment to realize that the CLICKING
sound is coming from Bobs SILVER ZIPPO

Bob is focusing every last ounce of life in his body to

just as Gabriel comes down hard in front of them kicking up
a cloud of dust

Gabriels mechanical wings haltingly retract The crash has
done some serious damage Much of his skin has burned away
Chunks of his armor and flesh are missing as well including
a large part of his head revealing that under his human
visage is a NIGHTMARISH CREATURE

Gabriel takes the bullet then slaps the gun out of Jeeps
hand
Jeep throws a wild punch connects with Gabriels chin
rocking him back More annoyed than surprised Gabriel
knocks Jeep savagely to the ground

Jeep struggles quickly to his feet comes right back at

again

fists This kid will simply not give up

Jeep moves in again swinging hard but Gabriel blocks it
shoots out a hand and grabs Jeep by throat lifting him

off the ground

Charlie picks the child up out of the brush

She helps Jeep to his feet and together they slowly make
their way to the top of the ridge

EXT RED ROCK RIDGE - DAWN

Jeep and Charlie stand overlooking the desert valley below
ON THEIR FACES reacting to what they see
Charlie takes Jeeps hand in hers

JEEP
We made it

CHARLIE
Yep we sure did
And now we see it too

THE MOJAVE DESERT - DAWN
Vast Barren No signs of life
No resistance force No nothing

ON JEEP AND CHARLIE

Taking it in Breathing hard
JEEP
Im sure theyre just over the next
ridge
He glances at Charlie Worry in her eyes
CHARLIE

What if were on our own now

JEEP
Dont be afraid Well be okay
(BEAT)
Believe me

At those words Charlie looks deep into Jeeps eyes
Sees a

confidence in them shes never seen before

And she leans in and kisses him Tender

When they part Jeep stares back at her with surprise
Then

the surprise melts into a smile

And they descend the ridgeout of sight leaving us with a

view once again of --

THE MOJAVE DESERT - DAWN

A BLOOD RED SUN rises behind the distant mountains The
unbearable cold will soon become an unbearable heat
And were back where we started

A YOUNG WOMANS VOICE Solemn Weary Determined

ITS CHARLIES VOICE

CHARLIES VOICE
Someday when my son is older I
will tell him about the time of his
birth when all the world was
covered in a great darkness

DISSOLVE TO

INT CAR - DRIVING - MORNING - WEEKS LATER

Jeep is at the wheel He looks aged scarred from the
experience His exposed arms are completely covered with the
INTRICATE WRITINGThe Instructions The boy he once was is
gone at last and the warrior protector has replaced him

CHARLIES VOICE
And how just at the moment when
everything seemed lost
happy

the

with

Charlie sits across from him the baby cradled in her arms
Its strange but you might actually mistake them for a

family Of course youll have to ignore the ARSENAL OF
WEAPONRY in the back seat

CHARLIES VOICE (CONTD)
a mighty warrior fell in order
to save me
Jeep glances over at Charlie and the baby He smiles at

image of maternal bliss
CHARLIES VOICE (CONTD)
And a boy faced his fear and rose
up to save us all

The sun shines through the car windows filling our eyes

its fiery light

THE END
