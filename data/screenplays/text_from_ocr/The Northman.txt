TITLE CARD HRAFNSEY —- 895 AD
EXT HRAFNSEY DAY 2
The wind howls

TWO RAVENS soar toward a wintry ISLAND Its high cliffs
violently lashed by the black North Atlantic OCEAN It is day
but already dusky The sun glows like a single red eye
struggling to be seen through the low December clouds

Below a LANGSKIP (a Viking warship) followed by three
KNORRS (merchant ships) approach the island with terrible
speed over the dark waves

They sail toward a towering NORSE STRONGHOLD — an
impenetrable wooden fortress that encloses a VIKING VILLAGE

The wet sails of the ships are stretched by the roaring wind
The langskip nears the shore at a menacing pace

The ships RED WAR BANNER streams The heraldry of a RAVEN
Long tassels of white horse hair flow proudly from it

EXT HRAFNSEY STRONGHOLD WATCHTOWER DAY 3
CLOSE ON AMLETH a 12-year-old boy He looks out to sea
tense with worry and excitement He is a thin child agile

and playful still reveling in the joys of his retreating
childhood

AMLETH
(to himself)
Hes here He’s here

Suddenly he is grabbed from behind A coarse voice shouts at
him in a playful manner

HEIMIR
Whos there Who

Amleth struggles to get free from the strong grip of a wildly
energetic fellow It is the kings fool HEIMIR a strangely
dressed man in his 50s His hood is adorned with the floppy
ears of a gelded ram and topped with a leather cockscomb
Heimir becomes darkly serious but keeps his smile

HEIMIR (CONTD)
Is it not our enemies wielding their
gleaming wound-snakes come to drown
us all in surging waves of death To
steal our screaming sisters
daughters mothers To burn our homes
to ash in ravenous Hel-fire

Amleth breaks free from Heimirs grip by kicking him in the
crotch He turns and answers cockily

AMLETH
A son who knows not his fathers
standard is a bastard and a fool
He runs away gleefully

INT HRAFNSEY GREAT HALL DAY 4

Amleth runs through the dark mead hall to the living
quarters

INT HRAFNSEY STRONGHOLD ROYAL CHAMBER DAY 5

AMLETH
Mother Father is here

Amleth comes bursting through the impressive door of the
Queens Chamber his mothers bedroom

A massive Norwegian Forest Cat in a silver collar slinks
toward her owner

QUEEN GUDRUN (30s) being dressed by her TWO CHAMBER MAIDENS
She looks at herself in a primitive LOOKING GLASS Shes
stunning Her ice blue eyes pierce with cunning and ferocity
Amleth CATCHES A GLIMPSE of her bare thigh

5

He runs up to her but is stopped in his tracks as his mother
turns swiftly around with a raised hand

QUEEN GUDRUN
(hissing)
Never enter my chambers without
invitation

But just as Gudrain is about to strike Amleths bewildered
face a third maiden HALLA shouts from an open door

HALLA THE MAIDEN
The King milady the King

Gudrtin lowers her hand and gently strokes Amleths cheek She
smiles and grabs Amleths hand

Together they run to the door with excitement

AMLETH
Odinn brought him home

EXT HRAFNSEY VILLAGE DAY 6

KING AURVANDIL WAR-RAVEN is a handsome well-bearded Norse
King (late 40s) beaming with charisma He rides his horse in
splendor through the village gates His mail and saddle tack
jangles

A procession of his men and the spoils of his Viking raids
follow behind his red banner The horses grunt under the
weight of the plunder dragging wagons of heavy coffers
containing untold riches

The villagers nod in respect Aurvandil acknowledges them
with a faint smile and a nod of his head

Fine snow drifts down from the dark northern sky melting in
the sputtering torches held high by the KINGS MEN

FJOLNIR a brooding dark-haired man (40s) is no less
handsome than the king His eyes hold many secrets He leads
the second half of the procession It is much less glamorous
No reverence from the villagers The silence broken only by
the strenuous groans of the men and animals

At the front Aurvandil halts his horse His procession comes
to a stop He looks over his shoulder to Fjélnir

Fj6lnir raises his hand giving Aurvandil a sign Aurvandil
nods and then carries on toward the GREAT HALL

6

Fj6lnir turns his horse around guiding his procession to a
dirt road that leads to a cluster of rudimentary barracks

He watches with indifference as the more sinister part of the
war spoils begin passing him by SLAVES in bonds

The long line of slaves consists of men and women of
different ages From their clothing hair and beardless
faces it is clear they are not of the Viking culture Some
are sick and weak after the long journey They are painfully
silent

INT HRAFNSEY GREAT HALL DUSK 7
Aurvandil strides into the hall on horseback

Dismounting he is met by Amleth and Gudrtn COURTIERS and
SERVANTS are in attendance Everything is treated in a ritual
fashion Everyone knows their role

ALL
Hail King Aurvandil War-Raven Hail

The wooden hall is as impressive as any castles hung with
great tapestries regalia mounted high tapers burning bright
and illuminating the sophisticated painted carvings that
transform its beams and pillars into fantastic beasts It has
been prepared for the kings homecoming feast

Aurvandil gives his helm to an attendant He embraces Queen
Gudrtn in a ceremonial way and speaks for all to hear

KING AURVANDIL
(reciting a poem known to
both)
Like a battle-dog returning to his
master

He looks her in the eyes and gently touches her braids as if
rehearsed

KING AURVANDIL (CONTD)
Ive come back to be fettered by my
queens fair locks

QUEEN GUDRUN
Ever are we bound my lord

There is a worried look in her eyes but he pays it no heed

He turns to Amleth

7

KING AURVANDIL
Prince Amleth you have grown too old
to be greeted as a child

He holds his hand out to Amleth Amleth nods his head looks
at his fathers big hand and hesitantly touches his GOLD
SERPENTINE RING with his delicate finger in fealty

AMLETH
Hail lord king

Pause

Suddenly Aurvandil quickly pulls Amleth to his bosom and
hugs him

KING AURVANDIL
But a father never grows too old for a
good smothering How I’ve missed
you my son

Amleth is relieved Aurvandil laughs Gudrtin and the
courtiers look on with appreciation

Aurvandil lets go of Amleth Gudrtin offers him her hand and
he takes it She is distracted and looks to the door in
concern She feigns an insulted attitude

QUEEN GUDRUN
Will your brother not grace us with
his presence

KING AURVANDIL
Think not on Fj6lnir hell soon be
with us

QUEEN GUDRUN
As you wish my lord

EXT HRAFNSEY STRONGHOLD SLAVE SHEDS DUSK 8

Fj6lnir sits hunched in the saddle of his horse watching his
men usher the slaves into the barracks It snows The wind
blows mercilessly

He looks up to the great hall sitting heavy and blue in the
twilight and the snow Its doorways and window-like smoke
vents glow orange with the warm fires burning inside Fj6lnir
bites his beard in spite

FJOLNIR
Proud-ringed peacock

8

Fjolnir trots to a Viking sitting on a horse next to him
HALLGRIMR HALF-TROLL an enormous muscular man in his late
20s with the face and voice of a giant His torch flickers

FJOLNIR (CONTD)
Hasten your work

Hallgrimr Half-Troll shouts to the men by the barracks

HALLGRIMR HALF-TROLL
Hurry there

He catches the attention of FINNR a short gangly man in his
30s with a hungry face and manic eyes Hes in charge of the
slave work Finnr chuckles with menace as he herds the newly
enslaved people

HALLGRIMR HALF-TROLL (CONTD)
(careful)
Look you sneer at the king all you
might he’s ever-still your brother
You have station

FJOLNIR
He smiles on my mis-chanced
birthright I’m ever-still the
bastard

HALLGRIMR HALF-TROLL
Many would wish to be in your fine
shoes

FJOLNIR
Like a stallions cock even the
finest leather shrinks with age And
my shoes no longer fit

Fj6lnir sneers again Hallgrimr laughs
INT HRAFNSEY GREAT HALL NIGHT 9

King Aurvandil sits in his high seat at the center of the
banquet table Amleth to his right and Gudrtin to his left
She wears a golden headdress All is merry Behind them is a
large tapestry with King Aurvandils RAVEN heraldry
surrounded by elaborate Viking patterns

Servants and slaves bring in food and drink for the feast

mead broiled fish and sea birds smoked leg of lamb and
more It is all rudimentary but served with care

9

There is joyful music of pipes and lyre Heimir the Fool
leads a small group of mummers clad in straw and one dressed
as a Yule goat Heimir acts the clown taunting the goat

At the table Aurvandil reaches for a tray heaped with smoked
puffins As he does so he grits his teeth with pain Gudrtin
notices

QUEEN GUDRUN
Let me help you my lord

She brings him two puffins She puts her hand on his right
shoulder

QUEEN GUDRUN (CONTD)
(in a low voice)
What is this Tell me

KING AURVANDIL
Nothing Gudrtin
(motions to the feast)
Yuletide shall lighten the spirit as
the sun finds its way back to us

The hall erupts with laughter stopping their conversation

Heimir the Fool is waving around a red leather phallus belted
to his groin He turns around bends over and lifts up his
tunic repeatedly mooning the crowd

Aurvandil shouts with a firm but warm voice

KING AURVANDIL (CONTD)
Enough Heimir Enough you creature
We have seen more of you than your own
mother ever wished to see

The laughter in the hall fades Heimir pretends to be
offended and collects his troupe

Aurvandil raises his hand to make an announcement The hall
falls completely silent

KING AURVANDIL (CONTD)
We return with prosperous hands from
wild untaméd lands Our fearsome
blood-battles fought with savage men

and dragons foul the thunder of
our battle din
(beat )

it is a tale better fit for a poet

Amleth looks at his father with admiration 9

KING AURVANDIL (CONTD)
This night weve made merry

Aurvandil motions to Heimir the Fool and continues

KING AURVANDIL (CONTD)
Yet after war there is one thing
finer than good cheer Silver

The hall roars with appreciation Aurvandil smiles as
servants bring four heavy coffers of loot into the hall and
slaves scatter loose rushes on the floor before them

Gudrin gestures for the music to start again

The highest ranking courtiers rise and walk to King
Aurvandil who sits on his high seat his sword across his
lap The King distributes the finest gifts himself finger
and arm rings Byzantine silk and costly weapons The
courtiers thank him with a mannered bow Amleth is at
Aurvandils side helping with the ritual Attendants
distribute the silver to the other worthy guests

Amleth watches as Aurvandil picks up a Middle Eastern-looking
amulet hanging on a Viking neck ring

He turns to Amleth showing him the gift
KING AURVANDIL (CONTD)
This was worn round a prince’s neck
when I found it But it was destined
for this prince Wear it always with
my love
Amleth looks at the Arabic design of the amulet with wonder

AMLETH
Thank you father my King

The King put it on him then strokes his sons cheek
tenderly

Suddenly Fj6lnir bursts into the great hall with a group of
rowdy soldiers and huge barking Irish dogs by his side

QUEEN GUDRUN
Fjolnir

Aurvandils face lights up when he sees Fjélnir So does
Gudrins Fjélnir walks to the king

Aurvandil remains seated and holds out his hand to Fjélnir 9

Fj6lnir nods his head and touches his brother’s serpentine
ring He hides his spite

FJOLNIR
Hail lord king

Aurvandil clasps his brother’s hand and rises He speaks
loudly for the court to hear

KING AURVANDIL
Furnish this fierce-hearted slayer of
men with some drink — that I might
drink to him

A servant hands Gudrin a fine decanter She pours wine into
Aurvandils glass horn then hands her own drinking horn to
Fjélnir He receives it with reverence as she pours

QUEEN GUDRUN
Accept my cup kinsman

FJOLNIR
M lady

The serenity of the moment is shattered by Heimir the Fools
snarling laughter from the other end of the room

HEIMIR
Look See how the queens cup grows
wet for more men than her king What
metal might buy a fragrant sip
Sweet silver

He throws a handful of silver coins in the air

HEIMIR (CONTD)
Or hard iron

He holds up his prop phallus like an erect penis and gives it
a good slap He laughs mockingly Gudrtins eyes flash with
fire Fjélnir lunges forward exploding in anger

FJOLNIR
Silence dog By Freyr you slander
your lord and mistress

Aurvandil stands and holds Fjélnirs shoulder He whispers

KING AURVANDIL
Please you Brother it is buta
jest A jest Heimir keeps a foul
tongue and I keep him as a deep-sworn
friend 9

Fj6lnir bows his head apologetically to Gudrtn and Aurvandil
Heimir bows theatrically to all

KING AURVANDIL (CONTD)
Come Brother heres one more in need
of your safekeeping than myself

Aurvandil nods to HELGA the nanny who stands at the ready
with one-year-old BABY THORIR in her arms Fjélnir receives
his son and kisses him on the forehead Thdrir pulls on his
fathers beard and Fj6lnir lifts him high

FJOLNIR
Thorir My son

Then with Thorir on his left arm Fj6lnir raises Queen
Gudrins drinking horn in the air with his right hand

FJOLNIR (CONTD)
To my brother the War-Raven

Amleth holds up his small princely drinking horn

AMLETH
To the Kingdom of Hrafnsey

The assembly in the hall looks to King Aurvandil and roars

THE ASSEMBLY
SKAL

INT HRAFNSEY GREAT HALL ROYAL CHAMBER NIGHT 10

A cracking fire burns bright Aurvandil sits slumped on a
stool and takes a sip of ale The Queens trusted maid Halla
is nearby while Gudrin weaves fine threads by the fire Her
cat is curled up by her side

TWO MALE SERVANTS remove Aurvandils undershirt Gudrtin is
STARTLED BY WHAT SHE SEES CAMERA DOESNT REVEAL THE WOUND

KING AURVANDIL
The enemy had a taste of my liver

With a gesture Gudrin motions for her servants to remove the
loom and weaving cards

QUEEN GUDRUN
Are you hurt

KING AURVANDIL
Enough for Amleth to be marked as my
successor

(MORE )

KING AURVANDIL (CONTD)
I watched his innocence tonight He
must be awoken to what awaits him

QUEEN GUDRUN
He is just a puppy

KING AURVANDIL
Hes the same age as my grandfather
when he took to the throne

Aurvandil motions to a servant who brings fresh clothes

QUEEN GUDRUN
That was different

KING AURVANDIL

QUEEN GUDRUN
He had to kill his uncle first

Aurvandil gets up His servant begins dressing him
Gudrtin moves slowly towards him

QUEEN GUDRUN (CONTD)
You have not seen your queen in a
season Come let me take you to our
bed

He crosses to his servant ignoring her

KING AURVANDIL
No Pray my luck-spirits see me to
many war-fields after I defeat this
wound I refuse to die in sickness
nor live the long life of a shameful
graybeard No I must die by the
sword I will die in honor

Aurvandil is almost fully dressed
QUEEN GUDRUN
Fret not You will die in battle my
lord The gates of Valh61ll await you
I know it

Gudrtin turns away from Aurvandil

Aurvandil girds himself with his sword He walks up to

Gudrin 10

She leans into him as if to kiss him He holds her
shoulder keeping her at distance

KING AURVANDIL
Keep the bed warm

Aurvandil leaves
HOLD on Gudrtn her piercing eyes full of thought
EXT HRAFNSEY TEMPLE NIGHT 11

A GRAND WOODEN TEMPLE sits at the edge of a small pine
forest silhouetted against the moonlit clouds Trees cast
their tangled shadows on the snow-covered ground

Two hooded figures Aurvandil and Amleth come walking to the
temple The wind rustles in the branches A raven croaks

AURVANDIL
This is the same path I walked with my
father and he with his Now it is our
path to walk

INT HRAFNSEY TEMPLE NIGHT 12

Aurvandil and Amleth enter through a narrow keyhole-shaped
door Amleth stays close to his father and follows his every
move

Aurvandil and Amleth are silently greeted by the Hofgythja
THE TEMPLE PRIESTESS a stoic middle-aged WOMAN adorned with
the temple keys over her long robes They hand over their
weapons — Aurvandils sword and Amleths long knife — to an
attending younger WOMAN in similar garments

The temple priestess walks Aurvandil and Amleth through the
dark temple Aurvandil reverently takes a GOLD ARM RING from
an altar He dips the ring in a bowl of blood and carries it

Amleth looks in awe at the splendid carvings and painted
effigies of the various GODS OF THE NORDIC PANTHEON all the
more life-like in the flickering light from the fires burning
in cauldrons placed at intervals throughout the temple The
goddess FREYJA greets Amleth and his father with both mead
horn and spear

At the far end of the temple they come to its greatest
effigy The one-eyed god of battle and poetry ODINN riding
an eight-legged horse with a raven on each shoulder A
cloaked MAN dips an oak branch as an aspergillum into a
bowl of blood and scatters the blood on the effigy chanting
a prayer A severed bulls head is impaled on a tall post

12

AMLETH
(whispers)
Odinn

The temple priestess leads Aurvandil and Amleth into the even
darker shadows behind the Odinn effigy

On a massive door set in the wall there is a grotesque
painting of the trickster god LOKI and his children HEL the
goddess of the netherworld the wolf FENRIR who will swallow
the sun at Ragnardk and the world serpent JORMUNGANDR who
circles the earth with its python-like body

The temple priestess unlocks the door and opens it The door
groans ominously She ushers them inside

INT HRAFNSEY TEMPLE UNDERGROUND CHAMBERS NIGHT 13

The door is bolted Locked It is dark The ancient walls are
flagstone adorned with neolithic carvings

Amleth stays close to his father as Aurvandil feels his way
into the darkness with his fingers He finds an opening in
the ground The end of a ladder sticks up from the opening

CORRIDOR 14

Amleth and Aurvandil reach the bottom of the ladder They
have shed their clothing down to their loincloths Aurvandil
wears the bloody arm ring

Amleth follows his father as they crawl on their hands and
knees through a narrow corridor with a muddy stone floor
Aurvandil hides his pain as he crawls

At the end of the corridor there is a hole in the wall Fire
burns in the cell beyond it AN OMINOUS MASKED FIGURE stands
like a statue awaiting them

INT HRAFNSEY TEMPLE UNDERGROUND RITUAL CELL NIGHT 15

The cell is half grave and half cave of treasures And
surprisingly wide and high It smells of mildew and rot
Human bones stick out of the mud here and there Some swathed
in precious but rotting cloth Expensive rings adorn
mummified fingers A skull wearing a ritual helmet sits ona
flat rock in the middle of the room Firelight shimmers off
of small gold foils imprinted with mysterious wraiths Steam
rises from stones nested in a hole in the ground

As Aurvandil passes the threshold he starts panting like a
dog shivering growling and barking

15

KING AURVANDIL
(whispering)
Be not afraid Amleth Do as I do
Woof

Aurvandil motions to Amleth to follow his lead

AMLETH
Woof grrr woof

Standing before them is Heimir the Fool in his role as a high
priest of the cult of Loki He shakes an IRON RATTLE and
speaks in a low menacing voice

HEIMIR
Who barks Is it the wolves of the
High One Or is it the barking of the
village dogs

Amleth dares to take a peek out of the corner of his eye He
sees the figure in silhouette a naked man with his hair and
beard braided in a witch-like fashion Heimir places two
bowls in front of Aurvandil and Amleth

HEIMIR (CONTD)
Harken to me you two-legged dogs
Drink the vision-mead of knowledge to
learn what it is to live and die in
honour

Heimir turns toward him suddenly bringing his face into the
light revealing his GRINNING LEATHER MASK Amleth lowers his
head in fear as quickly as he can

HEIMIR (CONTD)
To be in battle slain and in death
rewarded by the Valkyrie’s embrace

As Heimir bends down by Amleth the boy sees that all
kindness is gone from the fools eyes

HEIMIR (CONTD)
The warrior maidens will carry you to
the shimmering gates of Valh6ll

Aurvandil starts lapping up the broth like a dog and Amleth
does the same It is a murky hazel-green broth of
hallucinogenic henbane and what looks like human finger
bones

HEIMIR (CONTD)
You are dogs that wish to become men 15

Heimir the Fool pours water over the hot stones in the
ground Thick steam rises

Heimir steps up to Aurvandil and sniffs him all over

HEIMIR (CONTD)
Prove you are not a dog

Aurvandil burps loudly into his face Heimir smells it

HEIMIR (CONTD)
Ah not only are you a man you dine
like a king

Together Aurvandil and Heimir sniff Amleth

HEIMIR (CONTD)
And you little cub what are you

Amleth looks from one to the other before letting out a good
fart Aurvandil and Heimir smile

KING AURVANDIL
I smell a clever pupil

Heimir pours more water on the stones The steam thickens

The henbane begins to take effect Amleths eyes become hazy
his face heavy his perception confused The steam grows
thicker and thicker The ritual continues

KING AURVANDIL (CONTD)
At every passage one should turn his
eye round one should spy round

HEIMIR
For a foe might be crouched within
upon the floor

KING AURVANDIL
Fortunate is the man who has the
wisdom of life

HEIMIR
Wise in measure should each man be
yet wise enough to be the fool

Amleth instinctively joins in His heart begins to race he
grows more fearful by the moment He tries to stay focused

AMLETH
Wise enough to be the fool 15

KING AURVANDIL
Tell me how did Odinn lose his eye

AMLETH
To learn the secret magic of women

KING AURVANDIL
Never seek the secrets of women — but
heed them always

HEIMIR
It is women who know the mysteries of
men The Norns that spin and weave at
their well of Fate Freyja the shining
goddess The Choosers of the Slain

Amleth grows more anxious and tense

KING AURVANDIL
Live in honor

AMLETH
Live in honor

KING AURVANDIL
Safeguard your familial blood

AMLETH
Safeguard your familial blood

HEIMIR
Know you what that means Amleth son
of Aurvandil

Amleth cannot answer in his state
KING AURVANDIL
Should I fall by an enemy sword you
must avenge me or forever live in
shame
Amleth becomes desperate possessed with rage
AMLETH
I will father I will My blade will
not rest till its drunk the blood
from his open neck

Heimir looks at him His mask has disappeared

15 15

HEIMIR
Now live always without fear — for
your fate is set and you cannot ‘scape
it

KING AURVANDIL
Swear it

Amleth touches Aurvandil’s blood-dipped arm ring

AMLETH
I swear

Amleths last words are followed by a sudden silence AMLETH
REALIZES HE IS LEVITATING IN THE CELL He sees himself his
body sitting below him with Aurvandil and Heimir

Then he looks up the steam clears The atmosphere becomes
raw and naked Now Aurvandil is facing Amleth Heimir is to
Amleth’s side

Amleth entirely disoriented watches in horror as Aurvandil
starts unwinding the bandages from his lower body REVEALING
A HORRIBLE BLOODY INFECTED WOUND ON HIS ABDOMEN Amleth
hears a THUNDEROUS HEARTBEAT his eyes fill with tears

A SINGLE TEARDROP breaks free from his left eye It falls
through the air and lands in the palm of Heimirs hand

HEIMIR
This is the last tear you will shed in
weakness

Heimir closes his hand around the tear

HEIMIR (CONTD)
It will be given back when most you
need it

Amleth looks up to his father

HEIMIR (CONTD)
Now behold as a man

AURVANDIL
Approach Amleth and in our blood
behold the tree of kings

At that moment Aurvandil takes hold of Amleths wrist and
brings his hand to his wound Amleth tries to resist but his
fathers grip is firm Aurvandil forces his sons fingertip
into the wound As he touches the wet blood the heartbeat
grows louder louder LOUDER

SUDDENLY AMLETH’S HAND AND AURVANDILS NAKED BODY SLOWLY 16
TEAR APART evaporating into a swirling nebula

THE PLACE OF VISIONS 17

Within this glowing cosmos of dissolving flesh A GIANT
ARBOREAL STRUCTURE rises from Aurvandils flickering heart
The rising structure is a royal FAMILY TREE made of RED
PULSATING VEINS

CAMERA MOVES through the branches as if floating on water

GENERATIONS OF DEAD KINGS hang from its branches like rotting
and withering fruit The more mummified the farther away in
time they are

On the youngest vein-branch of this royal tree Aurvandil is
seen in his weakened state A vein grows from his wound and
it connects to Amleth’s fingertip

Amleth has transformed into a stoic YOUTHFUL KING having
shed the persona of the fragile child that entered the
ritual A royal helmet adorns his head SUDDENLY THE HELM
BURSTS WITH HEAVENLY LIGHT

EXT HRAFNSEY TEMPLE DAY 18

Dawn is breaking The sliver of an ocher winter sun peeks
over a mountain ridge in the distance It snows silently

Aurvandil and Amleth exit the temple exhausted and happy
Aurvandil holds his sword casually in his left hand not
bothering to gird himself with it on this peaceful morning
His right arm lies across Amleths shoulders Amleths long
knife is in its sheath hanging from his belt

As Amleth sticks his tongue out to catch a snowflake — a
WHOOSHING SOUND breaks the silence

Aurvandil stops in his tracks
There is a second WHOOSH

An arrow has lodged itself in King Aurvandils left shoulder
Another in his neck Its impact throws father and son apart

A small contingent of NINE Vikings is launching a surprise
attack Some ride small Norwegian Fjord Horses through the
falling snow Two fire fierce arrows running on foot the
others carry spears

18

One of the Vikings clearly THE LEADER rides on a painted
saddle wearing a mail coat and a fancy helm that covers his
face The others hide their faces with cloaks hoods and
felted masks

AMLETH
Father

Amleth reaches for his knife Aurvandil shouts

KING AURVANDIL
Run run

Amleth runs to the forest He hides behind a tall stone
The horsemen with spears surround Aurvandil He mocks them

KING AURVANDIL (CONTD)
Come for your carcass you mongrels

Amleth watches the spearmen attack his father Aurvandil
meagerly waives his sword at his attackers paralyzed from
his arrow wounds

Just then Aurvandil is struck with the first spear
Aurvandil twists himself in agony bravely managing to cut
another advancing spear shaft in half but his defense is
futile

Amleth watches as Aurvandil is thrown back and forth — the
spears repeatedly plunged into his body He is a mighty stag
being brought down by a pack of hunting dogs He loses the
grip of his sword and falls to his knees

The Leader dismounts his horse and strides up to the fatally
wounded king He removes his sinister-looking helmet
revealing himself to be FJOLNIR

Aurvandils eyes fill with horror when he sees his brothers
face It is true Fjdélnir gives Aurvandil a stone-cold look

FJOLNIR
You behold your brother’s gaze in
amazement I knew well you would Pity
you never paid a bastards eyes heed
before Now behold how swiftly your
brother swings his sword

Fj6lnir raises his sword to deal the final death blow

Aurvandil tremors in pain but speaks calmly — blood
trickling from his lips 18

KING AURVANDIL

Strike brother strike But know that
bearing a stolen ring makes no half-
breed a king Soaked in my blood it
will soon be sliding off your arm like
a serpent Your kingdom will not last

(a beat as he fights off

the pain) )
Let this misdeed haunt all your living
nights till a flaming vengeance gorges
on your death Strike Strike To
Valholl

Fj6lnir cruelly cleaves his sword into his brother’s neck It
takes three brutal strikes to sever Aurvandil’s head from his
body It falls at Fjdélnirs feet on the blood-stained snow

In his hiding place Amleth stifles his cry A single tear
finds its way into the corner of his right eye But it
doesn’t fall it is as if he is willing it to stay in place

Fj6lnir looks up from his vile doing The eight men stare at
him dumbfounded One of them pulls his mask from his face
revealing himself to be Hallgrimr Half-Troll He raises his
spear and shakes it The men beat their shields and cheer

HALLGRIMR HALF-TROLL
King Aurvandil is dead long live King
Fjolnir
In his hiding place Amleth hears the roar of the Vikings
VIKINGS
Long live King Fj6lnir Hail lord
king

Fj6lnir turns and sees Amleth hiding They lock eyes for a
moment

FJOLNIR
Bring me the boys head

Amleth takes off from his hiding place Three men chase him
through the eerily silent forest

FOREST CONTINUOUS 19
Amleth is good at this He hides in a hole by a fallen tree

trunk The three men split up in order to cover more ground
It looks like they may have lost him

19

When Amleth looks up from the hole to make sure they are
gone one of them attacks him from behind It is Finnr the
man who made the hand gestures by the slave barracks

Finnr pins Amleth down and gets his knife ready for the kill

FINNR
I’1l1 make it slow

But Amleth is quicker He unsheathes his own long knife and

with a swift move he slices off Finnrs nose Blood spurts

from the wound Finnr screams He drops his knife and covers
his face Amleth escapes

EXT HRAFNSEY STRONGHOLD DAY 20

Amleth runs to the great hall’s palisade gate he stops

it’s open Aurvandils guards lie on the ground with their
throats cut SOUNDS OF SENSELESS VIOLENCE comes from the
village Just then he hears a piercing scream

The lifeless and bloodied body of Halla Gudrtns chamber
maid is thrown from the palisade and lands hard in front of
him

Amleth hurries away from Halla’s corpse down a back alley
More corpses line the streets Stray dogs pick at bodies He
picks a discarded cloak up from the ground and disguises
himself as a girl He hurries in the direction of the
stronghold’s exit as fast as he dares

Suddenly he hears Fj6lnir’s men cheering and beating their
shields

Through alley fencing Amleth sees Gudrin slung over
Fj6lnirs shoulder Fj6lnir parades his mother through the
town like a trophy Vikings laugh and cheer

HALLGRIMR HALF-TROLL
King Fjolnir has found himself a
queen

Amleth is horrified He crawls under a storehouse on stilts
through muck and mire to try and get a better look He can’t
make it all out

As Amleth emerges from under the storehouse he quickly hides
again as Finnr comes running up the main street Blood pours
from Finnr’s face He shouts in an unintelligible voice

FINNR NOSE-STUB
Fj6lnir Fj6lnir my lord Th b-oy

20

When Finnr realizes he’s interrupted Fjd6lnir’s parade he
quickly goes to his knee in respect

Amleth takes the chance to run away right behind Finnr
disappearing into a group of mourning women (all with cloaks
covering their hair like Amleth)

To lessen his humiliation at the hands of Amleth Finnr comes
up with a lie He shouts proudly to Fjélnir

FINNR NOSE-STUB (CONTD)
Th b-oy Th b-oy is dea-dd

Finnr — who from now on will be known as FINNR NASASTUFR or
Finnr Nose-stub — points behind him to the ocean

FINNR NOSE-STUB (CONTD)
Dea-dd n the sea He sank like a
stone

EXT HRAFNSEY BEACH DAY 21

Amleth is alone on a hidden beach With all of his might he
pushes a fishermans rowing boat into the sea and jumps
aboard

He rows away from the island screaming his mantra of
revenge

AMLETH
I will avenge you father I will save
you mother I will kill you Fjdlnir
I will avenge you father I will save
you mother

The boat looks tiny and fragile as it bobs up and down on thé2
mighty waves of the Atlantic Ocean

EXT LAND OF THE RUS RIVER DAY 23
Two Langskips speed down a wide river in what would today be
called Ukraine Long oars move with military precision A
garishly painted dragons head splattered with blood rises
from the bow of the lead ship grinning with menace

ON THE LANGSKIP

Amleth now 30 years old is one of the many Vikings sitting

at the oars driving the lead warship Amleth has grown a
full beard his hair is long his blue eyes are full of hate

23

But the amulet hanging around his neck leaves no doubt about
who he is

Amleth spots a small fishing boat out on the river ahead

EIRIKR BLAZE-EYE (0S)
(finishing a monologue)
Yes The wise hunter only preys on
waterfowl before Midsummer blot

A FISHERMAN in his 30s and his SON 11 years old The
Fisherman sees the warship and hauls in the net as fast as he
can

Two whooshing sounds break the silence surrounding the small
boat one followed by the other in quick succession Both
father and son are hit by arrows that kill them instantly

At the back of the Langskip a STOUT VIKING Grimr Skull-
Hammer lowers his bow satisfied with his marksmanship

AMLETH
(muttering dryly)
Fathers and sons are always in season

EXT LAND OF THE RUS RIVER BANK DAY 24

Vikings are already on shore dragging the Langskips up on
dry land

Other Viking crew start unloading the ships Axes long
spears bows swords clubs etc

Amleth is with a team that cuts down birch trees and larch
bows and uses them to camouflage the ship

All this is done with great speed Theyre a well-oiled
machine

EXT LAND OF THE RUS FOREST CLEARING NIGHT 25
It rains

Amleth participates in a bestial spear dance by a bonfire in
the center of a shadowy birch grove He moves in unison with
his companion BERSERKERS They are the elite fighting squad
of the operation a select twelve-man group of Viking
raiders They wear bear or wolf skins on their shoulders and
backs the muzzles drawn over their heads Otherwise they
are in various degrees of nakedness Some entirely naked
(Amleth is bare-chested with his tunic belted to his waist
and wears a bearskin with a wolfs head)

25

To prepare for battle they are working themselves into a
mystical Berserker rage They are led by an old BERSERKER
PRIEST He is nude save for a belt and an ancient bird-horned
headdress He chants an Old Norse war poem They grunt and
beat their weapons and shields rhythmically abreast ina
line There is order and rigor to the ritual Viking martial
arts

BERSERKER PRIEST
Your bear-minds burn in the bodies of
men Sons of the wolf Fenrir break
free from your flesh

Amleths warrior body is muscular and flexible The light
from the burning fire flickers on his shining muscles and his
weapons of choice One arm-length war knife and a small axe
of the same length He swings them about his torso and
strikes them to the accelerating beat

Lightning strikes Thunder claps The rain begins to pour

BERSERKER PRIEST (CONTD)
Wolves will howl in the storm of
Odinn Warriors will fall as the Bear
claw strikes We will fight to
Valh61l1

The Berserkers shout and roll their heads as they begin going
into a trance transforming from Viking warriors into
fiendish man-beasts

BERSERKER PRIEST (CONTD)
‘Til we return to human shape
Fearless we shall drink blood from our
enemies wounds

They scream in excruciating pain

BERSERKER PRIEST (CONTD)
Together we will rage in the
battlefields of corpses The Father of
War commands us-Transform your skin
brothers Slaughter-wolves
Berserkers become your fury

The transformation reaches its peak An unstoppable fury is
breaking loose within Amleth pushing its way out of his body
in strong pulses His muscles start trembling his veins
throb his face contorts in hellish grimaces his limbs
stretch and twist 25

All the Berserkers around him foam at the mouth bite their
shields roar and roll their eyes back in their heads as the
rain beats down on them

They break from their line and descend into chaos

Amleths eyes burn He has become a super-predator
intoxicated by the promise of a merciless attack

Thunder strikes again Lightning flashes

EXT LAND OF THE RUS FIELD DAWN 26
A gray oppressive dawn

Amleth and the Berserkers prowl silently through a misty

field of high grass With the bearskins and wolfskins

covering their backs and their heads they truly look like a
pack of animals They move steadily toward their target ina

formation that is tight and fluid

Amleth grits his teeth and flashes his wild eyes as he
approaches

EXT LAND OF THE RUS SLAV VILLAGE DAWN 27
A sizable fortified Slav village It is peaceful smoke from
the villagers fires billows in the morning air There are
faint dawn sounds of cocks crowing and babies waking

OUTSIDE THE PALISADE

A NUMBER OF ARMED SLAVS mill about on the wooden ramparts
shivering

A Slav guard sees the menacing silhouette of Viking man-
beasts He screams in old Slavic

SLAV GUARD
The Bear-demons are here The Bear-
demons are here

Panic A wooden alarm bell rings Watchmen blow their horns
The guards on the ground close the gate as fast as they can

A Slav guard throws a spear from the ramparts It is a sure
and powerful throw

The Berserkers stop and watch with indifference as the spear
flies through the air

27

When it looks like the spear is going to land in the middle
of the Berserkers Amleth jumps up in the air and catches it
mid-flight

Then as if it were weightless Amleth spins the spear around
and throws it back This time it finds its mark and lands
right in the breast of the Slav guard who threw it in the
first place

They roar like bears and wolves They throw off their skins

AMLETH
To Valholl

The Berserkers spread out and descend on the Slav village
from all sides at once like the wrath of the gods

Arrows assail the Berserkers from the ramparts many caught
in their shields

Amleth quickly and fearlessly climbs up the palisade with
help from his axe The other Berserkers follow Amleth leaps
onto the battlements into the gatehouse He swiftly
takes out an archer severing his hand that still grips the
bow string Behind him Berserkers systematically destroy the
other archers

IN THE VILLAGE CONTINUOUS 28

Amleth jumps below into the village landing on a fierce
mounted soldier riding by He tears off the soldiers helmet
by the cheek guard bringing the soldier and his horse hard to
the ground Amleth then cleaves the soldiers head in two
with his axe

CAMERA continues to follow Amleth running with great speed
He splits the shield of an armed man with his axe then slits
his throat with his war knife The mans lifeless body falls
splashing into the mud Then Amleth turns swiftly around
disarming a spear-carrying soldier running toward him Amleth
kicks the soldiers shield into his face smashing his jaw
into his skull

As CAMERA follows Amleth running its clear from his
actions and the background action that the Berserkers only
fight other soldiers and SPARE the unarmed population THE
BRUTE VIKINGS DO NOT Most of the villagers are hiding
indoors or in animal pens but some brave farmers use shovels
and hoes or throw raw timbers at the Brute Vikings in
defense The women throw pails of milk and toss clothing over
incoming spear points — even some children throw stones — all
to no avail

28

One young woman OLGA (who we’ll meet later) fights
particularly ferociously All this time CAMERA follows
Amleth

Behind him Berserkers are taking out other armed Slav
soldiers right and left leaving the gate unmanned A group
of BRUTE VIKING FOOT SOLDIERS with pole arms descend into the
village breaching the gate These Vikings carry out the
actual raiding and pillaging A COMPANY OF VIKINGS come lead
the charge It is THE HIRD — THE HIGH COMMAND This high-
status group is dressed in mail shirts with expensive
engraved helmets scale armor painted shields shining
swords and flowing banners

Amleth keeps running through the mud An arrow narrowly
misses him A skillful mounted archer emerges hidden behind
a hayrick In fury Amleth runs full force toward the
archers galloping horse — head to head — more arrows
whizzing by him Just as he is about to collide with the
horse he steps to the side and grabs the riders stirrup
sending him off the horse to the mud Amleth grabs the
struggling archer bites into his jugular and howls like a
wolf — his mouth covered in hot blood

VILLAGE SQUARE DAY LATER 29
Silence The Slav village has been beaten into submission

Amleth stands in the muddy village square He is bloodied and
tired coming down from his Berserker high Around him his
fellow Berserkers stand still in similar poses Grimr Skull-
Hammer has many arrows stuck in his body He pulls them out
carelessly and throws them to the ground The Berserkers
begin to shiver Amleth pulls his tunic over his shoulders

BEHIND HIM Vikings separate the men from the women dividing
them into the YOUNG AND HEALTHY and the OLD AND USELESS
SCREAMING BABIES are torn from the arms of their MOTHERS
Cows pigs goats and other animals are slaughtered THE
CHILDREN are HERDED INTO A BARN with the old and weak

THE CAMERA stays with Amleth as he watches this well-
organized and merciless operation

Amleth sees THE HIRD trot through the village The GENERAL
barking the commands is a WOMAN A SHIELD MAIDEN The Hird
makes sure their foot soldiers do not spoil the goods It is
clear that the SLAVES are the real valuables the Viking
invaders have come for The Shield Maiden slays a skinny Slav
man being herded away

Two fellow Berserkers HROLFUR SPLIT-LIP and THE BERSERKER
PRIEST walk past Amleth They nod to him

29

HROLFUR SPLIT-LIP
These savages are fine chattel eh
BjOrnulfr We did good

AMLETH
(low emotionless)
Never better

BERSERKER PRIEST
(laughs)
When we found you as a cub I knew
then you had a heart of cold iron

Amleth looks away from him

SHIELD MAIDEN
Too weak I want strong ones Not weak
ones

The VALUABLE VILLAGERS are in the center of the square They
are terrified Humiliated families of petty nobility are
stripped of their fine clothes Goods are collected from the
houses and sorted and stored away in chests and on wagons at
the edge of the square

A group of Vikings encircle a limping woman (with one shoe)
She holds her six year old SON close

OLGA a young blonde woman with large wide-set eyes(who we
saw fighting in the raid) tries to intervene She holds a
LOAF OF BREAD and kneels before the group of Vikings She
raises it high above her head as an offering one of the
men goes to her and takes the bread he leans into her
Just then Olga pulls a small eating KNIFE from her belt AND
TRIES TO STAB HIM IN THE FACE HE RETREATS IN TIME SHE
WIELDS THE KNIFE WILDLY LAUGHING but she is quickly
restrained and dragged away

The men encircle the one-shoed woman her son runs free as
she screams But a Viking quickly picks up the child and
shoves him into the barn packed with people and bars it
shut Other Vikings SET FIRE TO THE BARN The Vikings laugh
and make sheep noises mocking the screams of those trapped
inside

In Amleths eyes there is a hint that he is waking up to the
brutality of it all

INT LAND OF THE RUS SLAV VILLAGE STORE HOUSE NIGHTFALL 30

The Berserkers are celebrating the successful defeat of the
Slav guards making the storehouse into a sort of tavern

They are being rewarded with plentiful food and drink served
by AN OLD MAN who can barely keep up with the warriors’
appetites A TRAUMATIZED MUSICIAN is forced to perform and
mocked when it goes badly

THORVALDR GIANT-CRUSHER

The Berserkers exhausted and wounded are still up to party

are dragged in by their hair for the Berserkers’ pleasure

the Slav village It is deadly quiet

Something catches his gaze

He walks forward slowly

Slowly
OMITTED 32-33
EXT LAND OF THE RUS SLAV VILLAGE CONTINUOUS 34

Amleth walks to a smoldering ruin of a Slavic Pagan shrine

It is much smaller than the temple on Hrafnsey but it shares
some of its features There is a kinship between polytheistic
places of worship Massive wooden poles with carved faces
decorated cattle skulls and singed bones of different
sacrificial animals

INT LAND OF THE RUS SLAV VILLAGE SHRINE CONTINUOUS 35
Amleth enters the ruined shrine

It is pitch black but at the far end the blueness of the
night finds its way in through a rift in the roofing

35

It creates ominous silhouettes above the altar from the
desecrated effigies and torn ribbons Offerings of milk
cream and eggs are spilled over abundant flowers

Amleth notices a strange movement in the shadows by the
altar It is followed by a low but insistent WHIRRING SOUND

The sound is strangely seductive and it draws Amleth closer
deeper into the shrine He is terrified but he cannot stop
his approach

By the altar Amleth finds someone cowering in the dark
turned away from him He walks silently toward the figure

It is a SEERESS spinning wool on her distaff and spindle
The seeress senses his presence

SEERESS
Prowl in shadow slayer of my people
Hide Even though your brothers stole
my eyes I see you

She turns to face Amleth Her eye sockets are dark Streaks
of blood stretch from her eyes down her cheeks

Amleth retreats in horror

AMLETH
I am no ones brother

She ignores his question and shocks him even more with what
comes next

SEERESS
It is not enough to be the man who
never cries Prince Amleth

Before Amleth can respond to her uttering of his real name
and title she quickly grabs his right hand with her left

SEERESS (CONTD)
The prince that turned from his fate
A beast that cares for naught A beast
that wrings tears from the eyes of
men A beast scavenging for wisdom in
the temple it burnt to the ground

Amleth tries to pull away but her grip is fiendishly firm
She forces his hand open and points to a single teardrop
sitting there glittering in his palm Amleth is terrified
She goes into a trance Her voice becomes hypnotic 35

SEERESS (CONTD)
Now remember for whom you shed your
last teardrop Remember the oath to
right the wrong Remember the Raven
King Remember Remember

Amleth pulls harder to retrieve his hand but the Seeress is
steadfast She tightens her grip on it and continues with her
prophecy She closes his fist around the teardrop

SEERESS (CONTD)
It contains the salty ocean you must
sail upon to the edge of the world

AMLETH
It feeds the freezing river of hate
that runs in my veins

Amleth is spellbound by her speech

SEERESS
It will take you to an island in the
north where there will spring a
burning lake bursting from a black
mountain’s peak

Amleth nods in agreement as if in a trance

AMLETH
There I will drown my father’s
killer

SEERESS

Follow the vixens tail to the
dwelling of the ancient one To seek
the fated sword that matches your
brutal rage

AMLETH
Why speak you my fortune witch

The seeress leans in and lowers her voice for the last and
surprisingly hopeful prophecy

SEERESS
For where your path of ashes ends
another will begin her journey A
maiden king

AMLETH
Release me 35

SEERESS
You cannot scape what Fate the Norns
have spun
(a beat commanding)
Now begone

Amleth wakes up from the trance and manages to free his hand
— or is it the Seeress who lets it go

Amleth shouts like a wounded animal as he is thrown back by
the release The Seeress lets out a piercing foxs cry

As Amleth regains his balance the Seeress has vanished Her
chilling scream echoes in the dark

EXT LAND OF THE RUS RIVER BANK DAY 36
Amleth is still in a daze from the Seeress’ words

He works alongside Eirikr Blaze-Eye dragging the bigger
branches away from the Langskip and getting it ready to
leave Several large Knérrs (merchant ships) are moored
nearby

He watches the slaves being sorted for the last time THE
SHIELD MAIDEN laughs playing a board game with her officers

As Amleth works he hears the shouts and orders of the Hird

HIRD OFFICER
These slaves go to Uppsala
(beat )
Those to the market in Kiev

When the slaves have been assigned a destination they are
taken to be branded After the branding they are herded onto
Kn6rrs along with the other valuable plunder

HIRD OFFICER (CONTD)
Send them to Constantinople

Another group is brought before the slaver for inspection
HIRD OFFICER (CONTD)
And these strong ones should make it
all the way to Fjdélnirs post in
Iceland

Upon hearing the last shout Amleth looks over his shoulder
at the slave trader

36

AMLETH
(muttering)
Who is this Fjd6lnir living in
Iceland

EIRIKR BLAZE-EYE
Fj6lnir the Brotherless So called
after he killed his brother the
disgraced King Aurvandil War-Raven

The last remark hits Amleth hard but he bites on it and
continues his work dragging a long heavy birch branch

and croaks

left there hanging over a smoldering fire

Behind him a slave ship is sailing away

In bed Fj6lnir awakes from a terrifying dream sweating and
screaming

A woman beside him raises herself up from the coverlet It is
the former queen Gudrin She rolls over and strokes
Fj6lnirs hair comfortingly Both have aged since we last saw
them but are still fit and fine They sleep in an enclosed
BOX-BED with locked doors almost like a large cupboard built
into the wall

GUDRUN
Hush hush my love

FJOLNIR
A voice cried out to me from darkness
It cried ‘Your end has come You are
come home home to Hel’
(gasping for air)
I fear it was my brother

GUDRUN
Calm yourself my love If your
brother calls you he calls from the
battlefields of the dead That is
where you and Aurvandil will meet
again

Fj6lnir finds peace in her words and closes his eyes She
strokes his hair and continues in a soothing voice

And you will kill him again And again
and again

Gudrtin makes sure Fjélnir is at rest before she lays her head
on her pillow But the instant she closes her eyes she is
startled by more ominous RAVEN CROAKING from outside

Gudrtin opens her eyes in fear She leaves her bed and puts a
blanket over her shoulders

walls and dirt floors it is obvious that she and Fjdlnir are
living in much humbler conditions than in Hrafnsey But the

glacier spreads its white-cold cloak in the distance

Massive chunks of glass-like melt-ice from the glacier line
the shore glinting like giant jewels in different hues of
blue in the morning sun It is as beautiful as it is
menacing

64

Amleth wades through the waves onto dry land from a row boat
floating at a short distance from the shore Behind him the
slave knérr is moored out on the bay and another rowboat is
shuttling slaves Olga is in the group of slaves just behind
him Corpses of slaves bob about floating in the water

On land a group of ARMED MEN await them with horses and the
trappings of the slave trade

Ahead of him Amleth sees slaves collapsing on the sand as
they reach it They are brutally kicked and dragged onto
their feet by the armed men

Behind him Olga stumbles and falls into the water Amleth
turns around and raises her up helping her to shore

As soon as their feet touch the shore an armed man pulls
Olga away from Amleth and drags her toward the group of
female slaves Another armed man beats Amleth with the end of
a spear and pushes him toward the male group

HALLGRIMR HALF-TROLL
Move

Amleth sees Hallgrimr Half-Troll and Finnr Nose-Stub
Fj6lnirs treasonous right-hand men from Hrafnsey They are
overseeing the arrival of the slaves Finnr’s missing nose is
now a Sinister concave slit Finnr shrieks in a nasal
aspirated voice

FINNR NOSE-STUB
Let him rot the seagulls will eat
him if they’re hungry MOVE SWINE

Amleth’s face is stern his eyes are full of hate Then he
remembers that he must play the docile slave his face goes
slack his shoulders sink

The two slave groups male and female are herded off the
shore inland in the direction of the magnificent glacier

that reaches for the sky in the distance

EXT SOUTHERN ICELAND WILDERNESS DAY 65
Amleth and Olga travel in chains with the other slaves They
are tethered neck-to-neck with their hands in shackles They
walk alongside small shaggy pack horses guarded by the

armed men on horseback

They are taken across immense Icelandic landscapes

Green lush mossy lava fields

67A

Multi-colored sulfurous mountain slopes 66
A valley with steaming hot springs 67
EXT SOUTHERN ICELAND KERLINGARFJOLL DAY 67A

The slave train is taken through bubbling mud pools and pits
emit foul smoke making the slaves choke and cough

Amleth and Olga are tied together by chains the train slows
down as the ground is treacherous

Olga looks over the hostile landscape She glances over her
shoulder at Amleth

OLGA
Why would you stow away to such a
hellish place This ground harbours
evil

Amleth scans the monstrous area

AMLETH
My Fate has brought me here to find
what was stolen from me

OLGA
And what is that

AMLETH
(hesitating secretive)
A mother a father a kingdom

OLGA
This is your kingdom

AMLETH
The traitor who stole my kingdom fled
here when another king took it from
him I will leave when I’m done with
him

OLGA
I am Olga of the Birch Forest and I
too vow to escape this island

AMLETH
Then you must face many foes

OLGA
As do you Would you face them alone

OLGA
Your strength breaks mens’ bones I
have the cunning to break their minds

Amleth looks at her with interest

HALLGRIMR HALF-TROLL (0S)
You two hold your traps Walk on

CAMERA PUSHES INTO AMLETH
The faintest smile passes his lips

AMLETH
Always heed the wisdom of women

68 EXT FJOLNIRS FARM NEAR THE SMITHY DAY 68

Fjélnirs farm FREYSDALUR is a prosperous estate with a
great TURF LONGHOUSE and out buildings in the same Norse
style Horse stables a barn dairy smithy tannery
carpentry dye-worksweavers workshop and so forth plus
workers living quarters and some dismal looking sheds and
byres — housing for animals AND SLAVES Flocks of sheep roam
the tall hills Cows bellow A rooster crows In the
distance over the rolling hills looms a black mountain
MOUNT HEKLA

Fj6lnir is working in the yard splitting a log into raw
lumber Hes with his son GUNNAR a 12-year-old who resembles
his mother GudrGn more than his father Gunnar chops away
with a small axe

ARMED MEN stand a stones throw from Fj6lnir atall times

GUNNAR
Why are we doing this
FJOLNIR
What
GUNNAR
(motions to the log)
This
FJOLNIR
Huh
GUNNAR

Its slave work

68

Fj6lnir sighs

GUNNAR (CONTD)
You are the chieftain Its your
temple and Im the heir to this holy
chiefdom

Fj6lnir halts his work

FJOLNIR
No man knows if he will celebrate next
Yuletide as a king or as a slave It
is best to be prepared for both

Fj6lnir returns to his work — but halts again

FJOLNIR (CONTD)
And to stave off the latter the least
you can do is show your slaves that
you are as strong as they are

GUNNAR
But no ones watching us

Hes right Everyone on the farm is minding their own
business (well except the stoic armed guards) Fj6lnir stops
the work and the conversation

FJOLNIR
Go and fetch us some whey And think
on what I said

Gunnar runs off

Fj6lnir wipes his brow and watches with admiration as a young
man practices his weaponry skills with two other young men in
a fenced off area by the forge

It is THORIR THE PROUD Fjélnirs son who was just a baby in
Hrafnsey Hes now in his 20s His sea-green eyes scowl Hes
inherited his fathers dark coloring and presence His pals
are the blond brothers HERSVEINN BATTLE-HARD and HJALTI
BATTLE-HASTY Thorir is fending off the two with a sword and
shield as they attack him with spears A sword master stands
by with a reprimanding willow stick

Gunnar comes back to Fj6lnir holding a big clay jug and two
wooden cups Fjé6lnir pours the whey into a cup he hands
Gunnar but drinks directly from the jug himself

Gunnar takes a sip and looks at Thdorir and his friends 68

GUNNAR
Why doesnt Thorir ever have to do
slave work Hes not even my real

brother

FJOLNIR
Silence

GUNNAR
But

FJOLNIR
He is your brother

GUNNAR
Half

FJOLNIR

Thorir has been reared up for a
different role Hell be sailing to
the court of Norway come autumn

GUNNAR
Mother says you favor him

FJOLNIR
Be glad you have a mother His mother
died bringing him into this world

GUNNAR
I care not I want to go to Norway

FJOLNIR
And you will But know this is your
family land Haraldr Fine-Hair took my
Kingdom Ha I care not I care for
you and Thorir When I threw my high
seat pillars to this shore it was for
my children to prosper The earth The
sea Great bounties for my blood to
reap And when our time has come we
will die into these hills

Gunnar looks up to HEKLA the volcano beyond the hills

GUNNAR

Then I wish to die into that mountain
FJOLNIR

That black peak is the very Gate of

Hel

44 68

GUNNAR
Then will I become Hels bondsman when
I am buried there — and Thorir will
kneel before me

FJOLNIR
Stop this You are brothers None will
kneel before another You must swear
always to remember that you are blood
- Now swear it

Gunnar touches his father’s arm ring reluctantly

GUNNAR
I swear it

Fj6lnir puts his hand under Gunnars chin and looks him in
the eyes Gunnar smiles

Just then Thdorir screams with rage Fjdélnir turns and
watches Thdorir lose his sword and fall to his knees
Hersveinn and Hjalti raise their spears preparing to stab
the furious Thorir Hersveinn and Hjalti put down their
spears Fjd6lnir shakes his head ignoring this outburst Its
clearly common behavior

The moment is interrupted when someone comes riding up to
Fj6lnir and Gunnar Fjd6lnirs guards ready themselves

Its Hallgrimr Half-Troll and Finnr Nose-Stub looking worse
for wear from the long journey The men lower their spears

HALLGRIMR HALF-TROLL
Fj6lnir my lord your shipment is
here
EXT FJOLNIRS FARM FARMYARD DAY 69
Amleth is filthy His hair has grown during the voyage to
Iceland It covers half of his now shaggy-bearded face ina
tangle

He is among the male slaves still chained in the center
farmyard

Olga and the other female slaves are there too
The slaves are dead tired after the long walk from the south
coast Some sit or lie on the ground Pigs scream from inside

one of the nearby animal sheds

Hallgrimr Half-Troll and his armed men watch over them

69

Fj6lnir comes striding forward to inspect the slaves
surrounded by Thorir Hersveinn Hjalti and his other men
all armed to the hilt

Amleth tenses up when he sees Fjélnir and secretly tests the
strength of his iron fetters They hold His attack on his
fathers murderer must wait

FJOLNIR
Well show me

THORIR
Where’s the rest of them

Hallgrimr and Finnr kick a couple of the male slaves

HALLGRIMR HALF-TROLL
Get on your feet On your feet

FINNR THE NOSE-STUB
Up swine

The armed guards kick the female slaves Everyone rises many
groaning

HALLGRIMR HALF-TROLL
Line up bastards

The slaves line up
Fj6lnir looks the men and the women over Hes emotionless
Fjé6lnir prepares to leave

FJOLNIR
They wont last the winter Sell all
of them

Amleth sees that he is about to miss his opportunity He
grunts loudly and pulls the slave standing next him to the
ground to get Fjdélnir’s attention It works

FJOLNIR (CONTD)
(to Hallgrimr )
Let me see this one

Hallgrimr pulls Amleth forward Amleth keeps calm even though
it is deeply painful for him to be so close to the man he has
vowed to kill Fj6lnir pinches Amleths biceps and thighs He
makes Hallgrimr pry Amleths mouth open so he can check his
teeth and gums Amleth plays the part of a docile dimwitted
beast 69

FJOLNIR (CONTD)
Weve kept worse

Fj6lnir gestures to Hallgrimr Half-Troll Hallgrimr unchains
Amleth from his fellow slaves His wrist fetters remain

Thorir steps forward from behind Fjélnir

THORIR
Im not impressed His stench

Amleth turns to Thorir

THORIR (CONTD)
Never look me in the eye slave

Thorir punches Amleth in the stomach
Amleth receives the blow with little reaction just slightly
bending over but he lets out a quiet guttural growl
Fj6lnir is impressed
FJOLNIR
Well I wonder what they call a beast
like you in the Land of Rus

Amleth answers in the Norse tongue

AMLETH
(in a hoarse voice)
I am BjOrn ulfr
Fj6lnir laughs
FJOLNIR

(to Thorir)
By name alone you can tell he is as
strong as a bear

Fj6lnir puts his face right up to Amleths face

FJOLNIR (CONTD)
(whispering)
But if youre as untrustworthy as a
wolf I swear I will put you down
myself

Amleth shivers with rage but manages to stay calm enough to

look Fjélnir in the eyes Fjélnir breaks off the staring
contest 69

FJOLNIR (CONTD)
(to Hallgrimr )
We keep this one the rest can go

Amleth looks over to Olga There is pain in their eyes as
they exchange glances

Amleth is about to be marched away when Gunnar comes running
over

GUNNAR
(remembering)
But mother needs two for the kitchen
and one for the laundry And two males
for the harvest

Amleths ears prick up at the word mother Fjdélnir scans
the female slaves quickly and without much interest picks
out three

FJOLNIR
Fine These two for the kitchen and
her for the laundry And chose two
male for the fields

Fj6lnir points to AN OLDER WOMAN A YOUNG WOMAN and a
TEENAGE GIRL by her side The women and the girl are
unchained

Then Fj6lnir notices Olga He looks her up and down barely
hiding his appreciation

FJOLNIR (CONTD)
(to Hallgrimr )
And her too
(beat )
Doesn’t matter if she knows how to
cook or wash Keep her arms white and
her hair long

Amleth throws Olga a glance She looks down Amleth is
marched toward the oxen shed by the two armed guards

INT FJOLNIRS FARM OXEN SHED NIGHT 70

The long single room is overfull with slaves sleeping tight
together on the dirt floor lying among other sleeping beasts
of burden — large horned OXEN A lucky few have some fodder
to lie on All is quiet Snores and whimpers The ominous
moaning of cattle

Amleth lies on his back watching the moonlight seeping in
through ventilation holes in the roof

70

His hair has been cropped short with sheep shears like all
the other male slaves Hes holding something in his fist

AUDUNN THE IRISH a tall world-wearied watches Amleth with
tired eyes He speaks half-asleep

AUDUNN THE IRISH
Plan to climb out eh Bear-Wolf Even
if you did escape this farm youd
only be carrion for the blue foxes and
selkies This island is a barren
waste Best find yourself some sleep

Audunn closes his eyes again and turns his back to Amleth

Amleth opens his fist and looks at his Arab amulet in his
palm

EXT FJOLNIRS FARM OXEN SHED 71

Amleth jumps off the roof He heads for the farmyard toward
the forge

INTEXT FJOLNIRS FARM SMITHY NIGHT 72

Amleth sneaks behind the smithy He can see the longhouse
from there (In the yard are other small out buildings and a
CHICKEN COOP)

Through an opening by the back door Amleth sees that the
smithy is used as much for weapon making as tool-making

FORGE

VOLUNDUR THE SMITH is finishing his long days work Lying
about on the work tables are fine weapons some being
repaired and some half-made

Behind him are stores of weapons in a side room A very well-
stocked armory

FARMYARD

Amleth gets closer He reaches his hand through a chink in
the waddle wall trying to get a short sword that appears to
be within his grasp but as his fingertips are about
to touch it there is a commotion in the yard behind him
He pulls back his hand

A brown-blue arctic fox VIXEN runs from the chicken coop with

a bloody HEN in her jaws The chicken is clucking loudly and
frantically flapping her wings

72

For a moment the VIXEN stares straight at Amleth It’s
supernaturally eerie

Just then V6lundur bursts out of the smithys back door A
LARGE BEARDED AXE IN HAND

VOLUNDUR
Get Get Get Thieving demon-bitch

Amleth retreats into shadow
The vixen quickly darts off with her prey
Volundur shakes his head and goes back inside

As Amleth watches the vixen run toward the hills beyond he
hears a familiar voice

GUDRUN (0S)
Away

Amleth looks up Gudrtin is on the longhouse roof a distant
silhouette She desperately shoos croaking ravens who fly
into the night He watches her

Amleth is flooded with emotion by the sight of his mother

AMLETH
(whispering)
I will avenge you father I will save
you mother I will kill you Fjdlnir
I will

EXT FJOLNIRS FARM DAY 73
A SUCCESSION OF IMAGES

DISTANT FIELD

Amleth is carrying a big load of freshly cut willow on his
back Smoke drifts around him He takes the load to a high
stack of wood that is being prepared for coal making Further
on are stacks of the same kind but already smoking

BY THE BARN 74
Amleth and three other slaves build a fence Amleth hammers

the posts into the ground with a primitive sledge hammer
Thorir supervises the work

UNCULTIVATED FIELD 75

The sun shines Amleth is one of a group of slaves extracting
huge boulders from a field Sweat pours from the men working
with rudimentary tools and bare hands Amleth drags a sledge
full of boulders up a hill grunting like a beast of burden

EXT FJOLNIRS FARM FIELD DAY 76

Its laundry day at Fjé6lnirs farm In the field down from
the longhouse Amleth is filling heavy buckets with water
Female slaves dip linens into the stream and strike them with
washing paddles On the shore more women pour water on rugs
and scrub them with their bare feet

Blue sky the sun is out
NEARER TO THE LONGHOUSE LATER 77

Amleth carries the two buckets on a yoke past a green field
where many textiles are laid out to dry

Amleth walks by a pair of slave women who are beating the
dust out of a tapestry he slows Its King Aurvandils
RAVEN heraldry stolen from Hrafnsey

Amleths face hardens

Two male slaves walk past him carrying another tapestry
draped on a pole

Amleth sees that slaves like this are going straight into
Fjé6lnirs longhouse — past Fjélnirs armed men Amleth pushes
away the slave holding the back end of the pole and takes his
place

AMLETH
Go take a piss

Audunn the Irish is at the front of the pole He looks at
Amleth with a bewildered expression as they head quickly to
the longhouse

INT FJOLNIRS FARM LONGHOUSE DAY 78
Amleth follows the lead of Audunn the Irish in front who
seems to know where they are going As they walk through the
longhouse Amleth surveys its layout

Amleth carefully scans the different ROOMS and CLOSETS
Everything is being washed and cleaned

MAIN HALL

78

The main hall is a poor mans version of the grand hall of
the Hrafnsey stronghold Imitations of grandeur

Amleth and Audunn the Irish are received in the hall by
HALLDORA a tough Pict woman in her 40s A former slave She
seems to be in charge And shes not to be trifled with

HALLDORA
In there

She motions to Amleth and Audunn to bring the tapestry to the
wall opposite the high table

HALLDORA (CONTD)
Stop there

There TWO MAIDS hoist it like a sail It covers the wall

This tweed tapestry is embroidered with the image of a red
tree its branches folding in on themselves and curling this
way and that It reminds Amleth of his family blood-tree he
saw in his initiation vision as a young man Amleth stares at
it in wonder

HALLDORA (0S) (CONTD)
You

Amleth is startled

HALLDORA (CONTD)
Get on with it

While Amleth was studying the embroidered tree Hallddéra
draped several more wall hangings onto Amleth and Audunns
pole

HALLDORA (CONTD)
On with you now

Amleth takes the initiative turning around so he is at the
FRONT end of the pole He leaves with Audunn in tow

CORRIDOR 79
Amleth crosses a threshold into an corridor near the master
bedroom Audunn the Irish looks concerned But Amleth is

taking the opportunity to explore the rest of the longhouse

AUDUNN THE IRISH
Where’s your wits Turn around

79

The door to the master bedroom is open A sweet melody is
being hummed inside it Amleth slows down and looks into the
room from a distance

MASTER BEDROOM 80
Amleth sees Gudrtin She is humming and tenderly combing
Fj6lnirs long dark gray-streaked hair He sits bare-
chested on a stool in front of her with his back turned to
Amleth It is a calm and intimate moment

Gudrtin becomes aware of Amleths presence She falls silent
and looks up She stares at him the comb in her hand

Unaware of why GudrGn has stopped combing his hair Fjélnir
reaches for Gudrtins hand and kisses it

Amleth is still in the shadows of the corridor Does she know
its him No She calls out

GUDRUN
Shut the door

One of Gudrtins servants quickly does so

OMITTED 81
KITCHEN 82
Olga is by the hearth stirring a large pot of crude

porridge Melkorka the kitchen slave is working by her

side Halldéra is now overseeing the kitchen work

Footsteps are heard coming from the corridor

Olga looks up and sees Amleth rush by the kitchen door
gritting his teeth overwhelmed with poisonous anger

HALLDORA
Keep your eyes off him child Your
gaze belongs only to our chieftain
now

INTEXT FJOLNIRS FARM OXEN SHED DAY 83

Amleth sits with his back against the doorpost of the open
shed He listlessly eats porridge from a wooden bowl

Outside the male slaves are lined up holding their bowls

Audunn the Irish in line scowls at Amleth Halld6éra
distributes the crude porridge from a big pot

83 83

Olga is there with Melkorka and other kitchen staff They
collect the empty bowls putting them into baskets they carry
on their heads

Olga stops by Amleth
OLGA
(in a low voice)

Did you find it

AMLETH
Huh

OLGA
What you lost

Amleth looks at her emptily

OLGA (CONTD)
In the house today Was it there

AMLETH
That and more

Hallgrimr Half-Troll and Finnr Nose-Stub walk over in the
background Hallgrimir spots Olga and nudges Finnr

AMLETH (CONTD)
It is a nightmare

OLGA
Then you must wake up

AMLETH
(hissing)
Its their nightmare

FINNR NOSE-STUB
You You woman You come with us

HALLGRIMR HALF-TROLL
You don’t belong here Fjélnir wants
you close

As Finnr strides toward Olga she glances at Amleth
OLGA
If you lose me will you come and look

for me too

Amleth doesnt answer

FINNR NOSE-STUB (0S)
Ho Here

Halldora catches Olga talking with Amleth again

HALLDORA
Girl I told you

Olga looks Amleth deeper in the eyes She places her hand on
Amleth’s hand For a moment

OLGA
Will you

Amleth watches as Finnr Nose-stub grabs Olga by the arm and
drags her away

INT FJOLNIR’S FARM OXEN SHED NIGHT 84

Amleth is asleep A persistent scratching noise from outside
awakes him

EXT FJOLNIR’S FARM OXEN SHED NIGHT 85
Amleth sneaks over the rooftop to see the arctic fox VIXEN 85A
scratching the side of the shed She stops and makes eye
contact with Amleth She wags her tail

EXT FREYSDALUR HILLS NIGHT 86
Amleth cautiously climbs the hill behind the farm looking
behind him He turns Ahead he sees the VIXEN running up
the hills like his first night on the farm

As he comes closer to her the vixen raises her head and
sniffs in his direction

AMLETH
I give you thanks little sister

The vixen licks her chops turns around and starts running
uphill

Amleth follows her into the misty night

EXT FREYSDALUR MOUNTAIN NIGHT 87
The vixen has brought Amleth to an OMINOUS MOUNTAIN

As the mist disperses Amleth sees a WIDE GLACIAL LAKE It

mirrors the snowy hills that slide into it leaving small
icebergs floating on its cool still surface

87

Amleth gets a glimpse of the vixen as she vanishes behind a
tall rock formation on the other side of the lake

Amleth comes walking around the rock formation The mouth 88
of a CAVE gapes from the mountain side It is lined with
woodcarvings smeared with dried blood skulls of animals
seashells and fish skin tatters of colored cloth

The ground in front of the cave is littered with animal bones
of various sizes A pair of ravens eats offal from
sacrificial bowls that have been put there for their sake

As Amleth comes closer to the mouth of the cave he sees the
vixen’s bushy tail disappear into the darkness inside

INT FREYSDALUR MOUNTAIN CAVE NIGHT 89

Amleth enters the cave and feels his way along a dark narrow
tunnel after a while the tunnel opens onto a larger
room the dwelling place of a heathen Nordic He-Witch Amleth
can hear the fell chanting of a man in Old Norse

HE-WITCH’S DWELLING

The shamans dark and sinister cell recalls both the
underground ritual chamber on Hrafnsey and the Seeress lair
In an open fire in the middle of the room something simmers
in an age-old silver cauldron adorned with the figures of
gods past It smells of sulphureous smoke and burning flesh

Amleth sees the HE-WITCH sitting by the fire on a raised
platform of gathered stones His chant seems to emanate from
deep within his throat he beats a drum like a seeress He is
singular in his poly-sexual manner He wears womens garments
under his foxskin hood cradles a Vd6lvas staff between his
legs and is barefoot with toe rings His braided beard is
very much male He is ancient and ageless His forehead and
eyelids painted lead white He stops his chant and his drum

He turns and locks his vixen-like eyes with Amleth peering
into his soul His voice rumbles like distant thunder

HE-WITCH
Sit Amleth son of Aurvandil

Amleth does

AMLETH
Did our hen-eating friend tell you of
me

HE-WITCH
No

89

On a flat stone beside the He-Witch there is a ball-shaped
object covered by embroidered cloth and decorated with
strings of colorful glass beads

HE-WITCH (CONTD)
One much more talkative

The HE-WITCH removes the embroidered cloth off the ball-
shaped object It is an herb-MUMMIFIED HUMAN HEAD the skin
dried and wrinkled the hair combed back and braided on the
sides

HE-WITCH (CONTD)
An old fool

Amleth stares at the head It is his fathers fool Heimir
his own mentor and friend from Hrafnsey

AMLETH
Poor Heimir

HE-WITCH
He speaks of days passed and days
yet to come

The He-Witch picks up the head from the floor and holds it
out so Amleth can see it better He notices that polished
opal stones sit in the eye sockets A red-painted wooden
tongue sticks out between its rune-engraved teeth

HE-WITCH (CONTD)
Fj6lnir cut out his tongue and plucked
out his eyes before killing him but I
gave him ones anew

Amleth looks with tenderness at Heimirs head

AMLETH
(in a low voice)
Kind friend Know that I will avenge
you too

There is a pause
HE-WITCH
I fear you must address me Alas I
made him no new ears They also met
with Fjd6lnirs blade

Amleth is hurt by the He-Witch’s mocking tone and lunges
toward him 89

AMLETH
Enough

The He-Witch stops Amleth with a look alone

HE-WITCH
You are still a beast cloaked in man-
flesh Heimir forewarned me

AMLETH
You said you know why I have come

HE-WITCH
Son of the War-raven the great giver
of ring’s son has no token for my
work

AMLETH
My torment is reward enough for
midnight doings Speak witch

HE-WITCH
So be it slave

The He-Witch cuts off a lock of Heimir’s hair He throws it
into the fire with some herbs The fire flares up with a
flash The cave thickens with smoke

He then looks with concentration at the severed head of
Heimir and sets it on a stone with the face turned toward
Amleth The He-Witch begins beating his drum breathing
heavily

HE-WITCH (CONTD)
Hear me wandering prophet wake
now from your murder

The He-Witch is almost hyperventilating falling into a
trance his eyes rolling back in his head twitching and
seizing beating and beating his drum — orgasming He pauses
in a moment of frenzy drool drips from his lips

HE-WITCH (0S) (CONTD)
Hear me Heimir is come

Amleth leans forward and looks into the eyes of polished opal
stones in Heimirs head He is transfixed almost hypnotized
The flickering light and smoke plays on Heimirs features

CAMERA NOW STAYS ON AMLETH

HEIMIRS VOICE (0S)
Hello puppy 89

The words are followed by a LOW HOWL SAD LAUGHTER In death
Heimirs voice is tormented and cursed

HEIMIRS VOICE (0S) (CONTD)
Your rage wishes to speak through your
hand Your hand longs for something
more venomous than a washing pail
Something that strikes fast as hot-
lightning something that cuts to the
heart

AMLETH
I seek the weapon the Norns of Fate
chose for my revenge

HEIMIRS VOICE (0S)
Hear me

Amleths POV The flickering fire reflected in the polished
opal eyes of Heimirs head seems to make them almost alive

INT SWORDSMITHS WORKSHOP ANCIENT TIMES NIGHT 90

The swordsmiths workshop is a dark foreboding underground
place with fires burning in many forges Shadows of the
SWORDSMITHS move about

A SUCCESSION OF IMAGES

HEIMIRS VOICE (VO)
Forged by the deadliest war-smiths
ever to crawl from under the great
worms belly

Hot glowing liquid metal bubbles in a giant crucible

HEIMIRS VOICE (VO)
It is a battle-flame like none other

A stone kiln is shattered with a mighty hammer Tongs remove
a steel ingot glowing like a red jewel from within

HEIMIRS VOICE (VO)
After Hr6lfur Wolf-Tooth ravaged the
lands of the Huns they offered it up
to him as a token of surrender

The luminescent sword-shaped form is brought out of a

blazing forge We glimpse the dwarf-like black-bearded
swordsmiths in the glow from the metal

90

HEIMIRS VOICE (VO)
a sword of the most secretive-rare
iron bound with bone of the jétnar

The sword is being shaped on a giant anvil with heavy blows
and cinders flying through the air

HEIMIRS VOICE (VO)
Weightless in its owners hand yet
like a dragons fang its bite can
never be dulled never broken nor
bent

The inlayed runic inscription upon the swords fuller is
pounded into place smeary with bubbling iron oxide

HEIMIRS VOICE (VO)
for its blade could only be
quenched in human blood

The glowing sword is thrust into a large vat filled to the
brim with a thick liquid that steams red as it boils The
sword is quickly pulled from the vat and it bursts into
flame

A small thick hand polishes the blade and slowly revealing
its name

INT FREYSDALUR MOUNTAIN CAVE CONTINUOUS 91

Amleths face glows in the light from the open fire The He-
Witch covers Heimir’s head The voice of Heimir gives way for
the He-Witch’s own voice

HE-WITCH
Yet difficult is the swords nature
for it can only be unsheathed in the
dark of night — or else at Hel’s black
gates

91

AMLETH
The Gates of Hel There will my sword
be just I will enjoy feeding Draugr
til then in everlasting night

HE-WITCH
Then shall you also enjoy the moment
when you must choose between kindness
for your kin and hate for your enemies
— for this I also prophesy

AMLETH
That is nothing My heart knows only
revenge Show it to me

HE-WITCH
It is not mine to give ungenerous
prince You must make a visitation

to Draugrs owner — the Mound Dweller

A black SERPENT slithers out of the He-Witch’s dress and down
his arm

HE-WITCH (CONTD)
Mark well the full moon’s light For
Shadows are not hospitable hosts

The He-Witch tosses the serpent to Amleth’s feet Amleth
jumps

The He-Witch laughs maniacally
Amleth looks down the serpent has become a coil of rope
EXT BURIAL MOUND NIGHT 92

Amleth is crouching on the top of a grass-covered burial
mound silhouetted against a half-clouded moonlit sky

He digs into the earth with his bare hands until he comes to
decaying wooden rafters set in the ground He rips them open
and is taken aback by the horrible stench released from
below

INT BURIAL MOUND NIGHT 93
Amleth comes sliding down the rope the He-Witch gave him

into the black earth It is as if he is descending on a

column of moonlight

He lets go of the rope and lands softly on the floor As his

eyes adjust to the dusky interior he inspects the contents
of the mound It is a kings tomb

93

At the far wall a Warrior King sits on his throne
mummified Under the grime and the dust he is wearing his
finest regalia — gold on his fingers expensive fur on his
shoulders a flowing cloak On his head is a glorious helm
intricately carved with a bristling boar on its crest

The burial chamber is decked with all of the riches the King
brought with him to the afterlife The mummified bodies of
sacrificed animals splendid cauldrons beakers game pieces
— and many costly weapons

Amleth approaches the Warrior King slowly carefully The
Kings enormous skeletal hands clasp the hilt of the
magnificent sword Draugr which is laid across his lap The
blade is covered by the age-worn scabbard adorned with a
garnet eye This sword is from a golden age before Amleth or
this Kings time

Amleth holds his breath and puts his hands carefully around
the sword just under the hilt

Then he pulls it toward himself to get it free
BUT
the Warrior King pulls back with amazing force

Amleth is thrown back in confusion and fear as the Warrior
King wakes up from his long slumber The King is UNDEAD

The Warrior King rises from his throne unsheathes Draugr
and swings it at Amleth Amleth swiftly avoids the blow

The Warrior King steps down from the throne He heads toward
Amleth with dread intent towering over him He moves slowly
but there is a powerful inevitability in each footstep The
undead cannot be stopped

He swings Draugr at Amleth Amleth swiftly avoids the blow

The Warrior King hits Amleth with his shield and sends him
flying against the wall Amleth grabs a chest of silver and
throws it at him The Warrior King attacks again

Amleth grabs a long knife from the wall and tries to stop
Draugr in mid-air But the enchanted sword proves to be as
powerful as the He-Witch told him The knife blade splinters
and falls to the ground in pieces

The Warrior King attacks Amleth again and again With every
blow Draugr narrowly misses Amleth The Warrior King is
supernaturally strong but not as fast as the living Blow
after blow the treasures of the mound are hacked to pieces 93

Amleth lures the Warrior King into a pool of pale light in
the center of the mound

The Warrior King halts and looks up into the sky The
moonlight shines on his shriveled eyes and for the briefest
moment it looks as if his humanity comes back to him His
grip on Draugr loosens he lowers the sword And that very
instant Amleth catches him by surprise

Amleth grabs a massive two-handed axe and strikes the Warrior
King in the chest Prying the axe loose he spins on his feet
and strikes him again in the thigh The Warrior King falls to
the floor Draugr drops from his hands the helmet is thrown
off his rotten head Amleth strikes him for the third time in
the back

AMLETH
Mark well the full moons LIGHT

Amleth picks up Draugr and chops the Warrior Kings head off
of his body And in the Norse tradition of smiting the
undead he places the head between the corpses buttocks
Exhausted Amleth looks at Draugr in his hand He turns his
hand so his face is mirrored in the swords clear silver
blade BUT in a flash

he is taken back to the moment he first touched the
sword The Warrior King sits before him again on his throne
Still Dead
Amleth looks on in fear

He grabs the sword and pulls it from the Warrior Kings grasp
the mummified corpse falls crumpling down in the throne

Amleth looks at Draugr in amazement

EXT FJOLNIRS FARM LONGHOUSE NIGHT 94
The night is still Half-clouded and foreboding

Amleth sneaks into the paddock at the back of the byre
jumping over a fence He holds Draugr in its sheath the belt
and hangers coiled around it

On the back side of the byre he prepares to bury Draugr ina
dungheap in the paddock He halts as he hears VOICES OF MEN

and the clatter of their weapons

Amleth quickly hides in the shadows

94

Fj6lnir is walking with Hallgrimr Finnr and Fjd6lnir’s dog
Rakki a frightening mastiff They are well-armed as always
but with some drink in them

FJOLNIR
Thorir will choose our strongest
Tomorrow well prove Hakon Iron-
beard’s men are born of mud and water

HALLGRIMR HALF-TROLL
Mud will be all that remains of them

Amleth readies Draugr silently pulling it a hands breadth
from the scabbard He calculates the distance to Fjd6lnir But
as soon as he is ready to strike his concentration is broken
by a DOGS PANTING

Amleth looks down Rakki is looking at him baring his teeth
and growling Amleth bares his teeth and growls too

Back on the path Fj6lnir looks around for Rakki

FJOLNIR
Rakki

HALLGRIMR HALF-TROLL
Rakki

Fj6lnir and his men walk towards the dog near the back of the
byre very close to Amleth They don’t see Amleth hidden in
shadow

But Fjélnir stops does he feel Amleths presence Amleth
holds Draugr ready but hesitates and that gives Fjdlnir
time to shrug off the feeling

FJOLNIR
Rakki Rakki Take Rakki home

Rakki stops growling at Amleth and reluctantly returns to
Fj6lnir He and his men head toward the front door of the
byre

FJOLNIR (CONTD)
Get you to bed It is nearly dawn

Hallgrimr takes Rakki by the collar

HALLGRIMR HALF-TROLL
Yes my lord

Amleth watches Hallgrimr and Finnr leave taking Rakki with
them 94

Fj6lnir goes into the byre

Amleth slides Draugr back into the scabbard and peers through
the back door of the byre

BYRE AMLETH POV CONTINUOUS 95

FJOLNIR enters walking past a COW with swollen udders and
miscellaneous dairy equipment The smallish outbuilding is
low lit by flame Along the walls are two curtained off
benches Olga Halldé6ra Korml6th and a few other ENSLAVED
WOMEN SLEEP on the benches Fjélnir wakes up HALLDORA

FJOLNIR
Wake you Fetch her You know the one

Halldora quickly gets up from her bench and assists Fj6lnir
waking Olga to make her stand in front of him Olga wears a
plain linen shift Amleth grits his teeth

Fj6lnir looks at her lasciviously and tries to grab her Olga
retreats shaking her head and Amleth sees that she SAYS
SOMETHING to Fj6lnir

FJOLNIR (CONTD)
The hair of a Valkyrie on a savage
Slav bitch

Fjé6lnir steps closer to Olga She pulls up her dress She has
an undergarment on reddened with BLOOD She is having her
period

FJOLNIR (CONTD)
(whispered)
A little blood

Fj6lnir advances again Olga quickly places her hand on
her loins and slaps Fj6lnir smearing her blood on his face

FJOLNIR (CONTD)
Unclean whore

Fj6lnir seethes with anger and retreats barking to Halldora
as he leaves

FJOLNIR (CONTD)
You will correct her or youll both
be dead in the ground
EXT BYRE CONTINUOUS 96

Fj6lnir walks off Amleth has climbed unseen onto the roof of
the byre he stares down at Fjdélnir

96A

96

AMLETH
Thank the Norns that a woman’s tide is
the only blood that runs in your house
tonight coward

He speaks to his sword

I am a fool It was foretold that I
would drown my father’s killer ina
burning lake Till that day comes I
will torment the man who made my life
a Hel Now sleep well night-blade
Yes we thirst for vengeance but we
cannot scape our Fate

EXT FJOLNIR’S FARM BEHIND THE LONGHOUSE DAY 96A

Amleth is working behind the longhouse with three other
slaves Under the supervision of a foreman ordering them
around with a wooden stick they are loading tents and other
travel gear for Fj6lnir’s and Gudrtin’s visit to Hakon Iron-
beard

On the other side of the longhouse the convoy is being
formed the sounds of horses and people coming OS

Olga walks by with two other women carrying baskets with
provisions for the journey

Amleth sees Olga and catches up with her They walk and talk
facing forward not trying to draw attention to themselves

AMLETH
Where are they taking us

OLGA
Something about a chieftain’s feast

Amleth grows more serious

AMLETH
Last night I saw him with you

OLGA
Then you know Fj6lnir’s touch will not
linger with me when I leave this
island

AMLETH
You marked him well And I have found
the cold iron that will strike him
down

96A

96A

Olga walks faster almost shocked by Amleth’s words They
quickly hide around the other side of the turf wall for more
privacy

OLGA
When will you do it

AMLETH
When I must For now I will haunt this
farm like a hungry corpse returned
from the grave Fj6lnir thinks Amleth
is long dead

OLGA
Yes but what of your mother

AMLETH
She will revel in Fj6lnir’s anguish
She only feigns her love to protect
their child When I free her I will
bring the boy if I must

OLGA
They’ve moved me back to the kitchen
If we can keep Fjdélnir’s men at bay I
can safely—

Amleth notices the foreman is coming around the corner about
to catch them He touches Olga’s arm with care

AMLETH
Our plan may have to wait

Amleth and Olga make a quick dash to the other side of the
longhouse before getting caught

FOREMAN
Bjorntalfr Move on

EXT FJOLNIRS FARM LONGHOUSE DAY 97

Early morning In front of the longhouse Fj6lnir Thorir
and a band of armed men sit high on their horses Gudrtn
looks queen-like on her gilded saddle She points this way
and that with the handle of her whip in charge of getting
the convoy ready

GUDRUN
You lot to the back

In the entourage is also ASHILDUR HOFGYTHJA a formidable

woman in her 70s Her eyes are great wells of knowledge She
is a temple-priestess of Freyr and Freyja

97

She whispers some incitations as she ties a rune stick of
bone into the mane of her horse

Next to her is her haggard gray-bearded assistant HALLUR
FREYMUNDUR who trails her at all times like a hungry dog
Rakki (the actual dog) stands to attention by the side of
Fj6lnirs horse

Everyone even the horses are dressed in their finest
conveying their strength power and wealth Thdorirs horse
FREYFAXI is special with its coal black body and flowing red
mane Thdorir pets his mane his fingers over-adorned with
rings

Gudrin goes to Gunnar adjusting his fur-trimmed hat

Gunnar is as happy with her attention as any twelve-year-old
would be

GUNNAR
Im not a child My hair is my own

GUDRUN
(looking at Fjd6lnir)
I know grown men who need a woman to
tend their hair

The slaves are lined up behind nobles and attendants They
carry parcels and bags of various sizes Olga is one of them
along with Melkorka and Korml6th Amleth is waiting to be
assigned a task

Thorir rides up to Amleth

THORIR (0S)
Can you fight slave

AMLETH
Huh

THORIR
Look me in the eye slave I asked you
do you know how to fight

Amleth nods Thd6rir waves to Finnr who corrals Amleth with
the biggest male slaves in the convoy

Amleth and the other four men are led to two horses who
carry packs with SINISTER LOOKING WOODEN STICKS and bags that
bulge with BALLS THE SIZE OF AN INFANTS HEAD

EXT ICELAND LANSDSCAPES DAY 97A

The procession travels over green hills that stretch for
miles under a blue sky

The procession travels toward an endless mountain rage 97B
lined with an autumnal birch forest shrouded in mist

EXT LAUGADALSFJALL DAY 98
Noon The procession travels over a rocky mountain stream
Amleth is nudged by his fellow slave Audunn the Irish
AUDUNN THE IRISH
Bear-wolf the Witless You like to
leave the stalls at night
Amleth plays dumb
AUDUNN THE IRISH (CONTD)
Our Thorir has flayed slaves alive for

less

Amleth ignores the warning and gestures to the strange wooden
sticks carried by the two horses trotting ahead of them

AMLETH
What are those

AUDUNN THE IRISH
Youve never seen a knatttré before

AMLETH
No

Audunn laughs

AUDUNN THE IRISH
By nightfall youll have seen enough
of them

Audunn crosses himself
EXT LAUGADALUR GAME FIELD DAY 99

By a sloping mountainside TWO TEAMS of four men stand on
opposite ends of a torn up grassy field They are ready to
play KNATTLEIKR the violent Norse sport (somewhat akin to
lacrosse or hurling) They hold their heavy knatttré
(sticksbats) shaped something like a huge wooden cleaver
with a divot for catching the ball All is silent in the
mist Blue mountain ridges line the distant horizon

99

Amleth holds the knatttré ready like a weapon

A redheaded teenage girl in fine dress holds up a red ball
ceremonially she pauses and tosses it in the middle of
the field

Suddenly all the men let out their war cries They run at
great speed across field fighting ruthlessly for the ball
These are fierce warriors not sportsmen

The feeling of the game is wild and primitive The only rule
seems to be to get the ball to touch the other teams end
line a six-foot wooden post driven into the earth The
players use whatever means necessary to win Its chaos

Suddenly Amleth sees the ball come flying straight at his
face He breaks its flight midair with his knatttré It drops
down on the ground in front of his feet Two of his
opponents BERSERKER-TYPES scream like beasts running for
the ball

Amleth realizes he needs to move He quickly pushes the ball
toward the enemy teams end line

The two berserker-types catch up with him one tackles
him sending him toward the muddy outskirts of the field

Amleth passes the ball to Audunn before he hits the ground
hard THORFINNR TOOTH-GNASHER a massive frightening dark
haired man from the other team kicks Amleth into the muddy
ditch before spitting on him and returning to the game
Amleth struggles up slipping in the mud and runs back to
the field

Meanwhile Audunn has the ball He is immediately set upon
by their opponents Thdérfinnr catches up with him and smashes
his kneecaps knocking him to the ground They beat him
mercilessly His mouth is ripped open by the blows from
Thorfinnrs knatttré — his teeth come flying out of his mouth
in spurts of blood spilling across the field like the beads
of a broken necklace

Loud cheers echo in the hills

Amleth looks over to hospitality tents set up somewhat
similar to a medieval jousting tournament Fj6lnir Gudrtn
Thorir and Gunnar watch the game with the family who owns
the enemy team chieftain HAKON IRON-BEARD his wife
GUNNHILDR SHIP-BREASTED and their CHILDREN and RETAINERS and
SLAVES (it was Hakon’s daughter who threw the ball into the
pitch) 99

Gunnar is not too happy about his teams poor performance He
shouts to Amleth and his teammates

GUNNAR
You’re shaming our familys name We
need more men

Hakon Gunnhildr and their people cheer even more as Audunn
the Irishs limp body is dragged off of the field and onto
the shore by two of his fellow slaves

Amleth watches as they lay Audunn on the grass near two other
members of Fj6lnirs team One is bloodied and bruised The
other looks dead with his neck broken

THE FIELD LATER 100

The ball is back in the game and Amleth is hot on the heels
of one of his opponents (Amleth is the last man standing on
his team )

Amleth is getting the knack of it now and takes out one of
the berserker types with his knatttré as the other tries
to attack him from behind Amleth takes a huge swipe
smashing the player square in the face with a huge explosion
of blood

Fj6lnirs people cheer Thorir beats his decorated shield
THE FIELD LATER 101

Now there are only two players left on the field — Amleth and
Thorfinnr

Amleth locks eyes with Thorfinnr His face is a mask of
concentration Thdérfinnr is just as stoic trembling with
fury They seize it with equal force pressed shoulder to
shoulder Amleth gets the advantage and quickly hits the ball
through Thorfinnr’s legs and far across the field toward the
goal post Amleth and Thorfinnr are still locked in
conflict

Suddenly Amleth hears GUNNAR screaming his war cry and sees
the boy running to the field knatttré in hand Gunnar
gets the ball and runs toward the goal

Thorfinnr tears himself from Amleth and runs full-force
toward the boy his knatttré raised

Gunnar realizes what hes gotten himself into He picks up
the ball and starts running even faster away from Thorfinnr

GUDRUN SCREAMS

101

Amleth looks at his mother

Amleth grits his teeth and takes off after Thdorfinnr fast as
he can to save Gunnar

GUDRUN
Gunnar

HAKON IRON-BEARD
Halt the game Halt it now

Gudrin Fj6lnir and others start running to the field

Before Amleth can catch Thorfinnr and just before Gunnar
reaches the goal post the huge man body checks Gunnar
hard to the ground

Gunnar is immediately unconscious BLOOD trickles from his
hairline into the mud The ball slips from his hand

Thorfinnr towers over the boy trembling with adrenaline
As quickly as he raises his knatttré to strike at the ball
right next to Gunnar’s head about to deal a fatal blow

THORFINNR
Stupid runt

Just then Amleth roars like a bear-wolf and tackles
Thorfinnr to the ground knatttrés flying out of their hands

They wrestle with great strength Thorfinnr punches Amleth
in the face repeatedly In berserker-mode Amleth head-
butts Thorfinnr and flips him over Amleth head-butts him
over and over and again until Thorfinnr is nothing but a
lifeless pulp

Amleth gets up he sees Gudran hugging Gunnar tightly but
before she has the chance to look up and thank her son’s
savior Amleth walks away from her

Gudrtin strokes Gunnars blood-soaked hair Fj6lnir quickly
follows and takes his hand

FJOLNIR
(kindly)
You stupid stupid boy Wake up Wake

Thorir and the others arrive

As Gudrtn strokes his cheek Gunnar slowly awakes he
looks at his parents 101

GUNNAR
Did we win

Gudrtin smiles with pride

GUDRUN
Spoken like a true chieftains son

HAKON IRON-BEARD
Brave boy A brave young man

They all laugh Amleth withdraws far from the crowd
EXT LAUGADALUR FIELD SLAVES’ CAMPSITE NIGHT 102

A bonfire rages in an open space encircled by simple tents of
Fjélnirs slaves camp Slaves dance to the hypnotic beat of
a drum around the fire They wear crowns of rowan branches
adorned with bright red berries and drink ale from bowls

Amleth stands on the edge not participating

Melkorka and another slave EYSTEINN an impish man in his
late 20s sing an episode from Bésa Saga and Herrédds
Melkorka uses a milk pail as a drum The beat and alcohol
enhance the impact of the bawdy story Their dancing is
erotic and wild

MELKORKA THE KITCHEN SLAVE
What do you want from me Asked the
farmer’s daughter

EYSTEINN
I need to water my steed at your wine-
trough answered Bosi

The slaves laugh as they dance faster and faster around the
fire

Amleth exchanges glances with Olga enjoying herself
dancing

The couples grow increasingly lustful from the heat the
story and the steady rhythm Fondling and kissing

MELKORKA THE KITCHEN SLAVE
“Where is your steed my sweet” she
said

EYSTEINN
“Between my two legs my love” he
replied “and you may stroke him but
gently since he is very bashful”

102

A COUPLE close to Amleth leaves the circle the woman leads
the man into the darkened forest surrounding the camp

MELKORKA THE KITCHEN SLAVE
Said the girl “Ill guide him there
and thrust him deep if he does not
want to freely drink ”

The fire is smoking adding to the growing sexual atmosphere
of what is turning into a mating ritual

MELKORKA THE KITCHEN SLAVE (CONTD)
She took hold of Bosis staff and
stroked it “It is a tender steed
although rather stiff at the neck”

A trio of lovers runs off to the forest

MELKORKA THE KITCHEN SLAVE (CONTD)
Be careful not to drown your steed
Shrieked the farmer’s daughter

Amleth looks at Olga He sees that another slave dancing next
to her is eyeing her too

Hallgrimr Half-Troll appears at the edge of the slaves
campsite He motions to Amleth to come and see him

HALLGRIMR HALF-TROLL
You This way

Amleth looks at Olga again She smiles but he cant be sure
the smile is meant for him

Reluctantly Amleth leaves the slaves raunchy party and goes
to join Hallgrimr

AT THE EDGE OF HAKONS CAMPSITE 103

A group of men awaits Amleth at the edge of the campsite It
is Thorir flanked by Hersveinn and Hjalti Thdorirs horse
Freyfaxi grazes close by

THORIR
You showed yourself brave and loyal
Father and Mother are grateful

Thorir falls silent and extends his hand Amleth realizes
that hes expected to be thankful for Fj6lnir and Gudrtins
gratitude Amleth bows his head

AMLETH
Thank you

103 103

Amleth is distracted by the sight of the fine tent in the
distance Hakon is throwing a Vetrarnetr feast for Fj6lnir
and Gudrtins entourage The tent is open to the field side
and Amleth sees that they are being served good food and
drink The sound of celebratory music comes from inside

THORIR
When we return to the farm certain
privileges will be granted you

AMLETH
Huh

Thorir looks over his shoulder acknowledging Fjélnirs
presence Fjdélnir watches them from a short distance both as
if he is making sure Amleth understands Thorir has his
approval for what is going on and to make sure Thorir
doesnt blow it

THORIR
You will be moved from the stalls to
the foremans quarters You will eat
better Your work will be less
burdensome You will command others
burden

Amleth nods Thdorir enjoys the authority hes been given

THORIR (CONTD)
And BjOrnulfr as a reward for winning
us the game I’1l let you choose a
woman for yourself
(gestures to the slaves’
campsite)
From your own kind of course
(beat )
Even that Slav bitch Ive seen you
eyeing Father found her too
unyielding

AMLETH
THORIR
Something the matter with you
(beat )

You understand me

AMLETH
I will uh sleep better

Amleths aloofness disturbs Thérir in his role as authority
but he continues as well as he can 103

THORIR
But know that we will never make you a
free man The stench of a low-born
slave cannot escape him

AMLETH
(absent-minded)
Yes Thank you

Thorir nods and leaves in the direction of the fine tent
followed by Hersveinn Hjalti and Hallgrimr Half-Troll

HERSVEINN
We’ll miss you

HJALTI
Cleaning the shit house

They laugh

As Thorir reaches Fjd6lnir Fj6lnir taps him on the shoulder
approvingly

Amleth watches them leave Through an opening in the fine
tent Amleth sees Gudrin raising a gold decorated drinking
horn and for a second it looks like she is raising it in his
direction — but then Gunnar leans into the picture with his
own decorated horn

THE SLAVES CAMPSITE 104

Amleth comes back into the slaves campsite It is empty
Olga is gone from her place The fire is smoking and the wind
blows smoke into the shadowy woods

EXT LAUGADALUR WOODS NIGHT 105

Amleth finds his way through the autumnal smoke-filled
woods Naked bodies run by in the cold autumn air All around
him he hears the sounds of people mating or chasing each
other through the trees

Amleth searches for Olga He comes to a clearing in the
woods He sees a woman standing with her back to him Is it
Olga Amleth walks to her Just as he is about to reach her
aman rises from the ground in front of her and embraces her

AMLETH
Olga

Amleth pulls back with disappointment but then sees her
face Its not Olga

105

Just then Olgas voice comes from behind him

OLGA
You found me

He turns around Olga is standing there smiling

AMLETH
Were you lost

OLGA
Only if you were searching for me

EXT LAUGADALUR WOODS NIGHT LATER 106

Amleth and Olga make love in the moss under the clear evening
sky The breeze swaying the dark branches of the birch trees
The full moon glows above

POST-COITUS 107
Amleth looks Olga tenderly in the eyes

She smiles and turns away She kneels naked on the moss She
caresses it and whispers some kind of incantation

OLGA
(Old Slavic)
Mother Soil hear your daughter’s
prayer Show me the way to destroy our
enslavers and free my love from his
fire and sorrow

AMLETH
What do you do

OLGA
Here where the threads of Fate have
bound us together embraced beneath
the trees Here I speak with the
earth

AMLETH
What does she tell you

OLGA
How to reach your mother My Earth
magic will stoke the flames of your
sword

She picks up a RED SPOTTED MUSHROOM and smiles

107

AMLETH
Tomorrow night you and I will begin
this nightmare

Amleth looks at Olga

AMLETH (CONTD)
And bring Fj6lnir’s life to chaos

TITLE CARD THE NIGHT BLADE FEEDS

EXT FJOLNIRS FARM BARN THE NEXT DAY 108
There is snow in the mountains The fields by Fjélnirs farm
have turned yellow and gray The sun is low in the sky A
group of women walk by singing spinning wool on their
distaffs Other women weave on looms in their weaving huts
Amleth is overseeing a crew of slaves charged with bringing
the last of the barley harvest inside for the winter They
work hard Amleth is firm and fair

Amleth helps a slave bring a bushel of barley on the cart

AMLETH
Come come

Amleth looks to the mountains The sun is setting behind a
mountain ridge in the west He turns and shouts

AMLETH (CONTD)
Finish

Amleth turns to AN OLDER SLAVE standing nearby

AMLETH (CONTD)
Back to the stalls

The older slave nods Amleth motions to a younger slave
hauling barley

AMLETH (CONTD)
You

EXT FJOLNIRS FARM TEMPLE HOUSE DAY 109

The temple house is situated at a short distance from the
longhouse on a rocky hillock It is a much smaller version of
the grand temple from Hrafnsey decorated with elaborate
mythological wood carvings

Amleth comes to the temple house with the younger slave They
carry barley on their backs

INT FJOLNIRS FARM TEMPLE HOUSE DAY 110

Amleth and the younger slave are led into the temple house
through the front door by ASHILDUR HOFGYTHJA Ashildur looks
at the barley with reverence

ASHILDUR HOFGYTHJA
The servants of Freyr Lay them before
our lord’s feet

Like the Hrafnsey temple there are carvings of the Nordic
pantheon But here it is the fertility god FREYR who is the
center of attention with paintings of his sister goddess
Freyja

Freyrs imposing wooden effigy rises thirteen feet tall from
the floor He sits with a massive PHALLUS sticking out from
his lap Skulls and bones of horses and swine are placed in a
ritualistic way around the blood-stained altar

Fj6lnir stands before the effigy He puts on a blood-dipped
gold ARM RING at the altar He assumes a reverent posture and
shakes an IRON RATTLE He is the high priest here

Ashildur Hofgythja brings Amleth and the two younger slaves
to the front of the altar

Fjélnir prays with closed eyes while Ashildur Hofgythja
supervises the slaves and Hallur Freymundur They place the
barley at the base of the Freyr effigy

Amleth looks at the back of Fjdélnirs head with wrath

Just then Amleth hears a faint sound that catches his
attention a barely audible whisper

KING AURVANDIL
Amleth

Amleth turns and sees
KING AURVANDIL sitting in the shadow of a far off corner of
the temple He is pale but dressed in full regalia war-

helmed holding a sword and raven-topped scepter

Amleth and Aurvandil lock eyes The king conveys a fatherly
approval

EXT FJOLNIRS FARM LONGHOUSE NIGHT 111

The full autumn moon rides through the clouds drifting
across the black night sky

111

A back door on the longhouse is thrown open Hersveinn Battle-
Hard and Hjalti Battle-Hasty Thdorirs companions step
outside happily drunk

The sound of feasting can be heard coming from inside

Hersveinn and Hjalti lock arms in a brotherly way and bend
forward to VOMIT in unison

They raise themselves up and wipe the vomit from their lips
laughing

They head toward the OUTHOUSE singing a drinking song A man
exits the outhouse pulling up his trousers

As they disappear into the darkness of the outhouse Amleth
jumps off the roof

AMLETH (0S)
Fear not you’re the first of many

Amleth unsheathes Draugr It flashes in the moonlight

He leaps into the outhouse there is a SWOOSH and a CRUNCH
as Amleth finishes Hersveinn and Hjalti with two swift blows

EXT FJOLNIRS FARM BARN DAY 112
Dawn breaks over the valley A scream rings out

The workers of Fj6lnirs farm both the free and the slaves
are assembled by the barn staring at the mutilated corpses
of Hersveinn Battle-Hard and Hjalti Battle-Hasty

The two men have been dismembered and hung out for display on
the side of the barn Their body parts are all mixed up and
arranged by an evil design to resemble one monstrous beast
with two heads four arms and four legs — the wall is
smeared with their blood their intestines strung out

Amleth stands with the slaves from the barn crew who we saw
earlier He watches with a neutral expression hiding his
interest in what is going on

Olga is also among the slaves She alone is aware of the
truth of what happened and tries not to look in Amleths
direction

Thorir is already at the scene beside himself with grief and
anger

112

THORIR
O I will find who did this I will
find them And I will tear out
their eyes And I will tear out

heathen cursing

Troll Finnr Nose-stub Rakki the dog and several more armed
men They are all shocked by the gory sight Rakki BARKS

slaves with kicks and blows

Gudrtin slaps Thorir in the face then motions to Fjdélnir and
Hallgrimr Half-Troll to restrain him

With the help of an armed man Hallgrimr takes Thorir by the

arm and drags him away from the side of the barn to Fj6lnir

Fjolnir takes Tho6rirs head in his hands and looks him in the
eyes

avenge them Take him away

Finnr Nose-stub gestures to the Christian slaves huddled
together after Thorirs attack

FJOLNIR
For what These boys never touched
them

GUDRUN

And how might they find weapons

Just then ASHILDUR HOFGYTHJA comes to the scene Everyone
parts for her

Amleth watches Ashildur walk slowly and deliberately to the
barn She inspects the corpse arrangement closely and is
unafraid to touch them
There is silence as she runs her fingertips over the cuts
where the mens heads and limbs were separated from their
bodies
Ashildur turns and looks at Gudrin and Fjélnir

(in a low voice)
No These wounds are not of our
world
She continues with unblinking seriousness

This distempered spirit will ride
again It wields a hungry blade

Fear strikes Fj6lnir and Gudrtn

Finnr Nose-stub starts dispersing the crowd with the help of
the armed men and kicks a Christian slave in the backside

As he follows his barn crew Amleth bumps into Olga who has
found her way to his side She shows him a small bag of RED

settled here What enemies we had
would have hunted us while their blood
still boiled Yet my brother’s

assail us here There have been no

The HOWLING is heard coming from the distance

Rakki answers the distant howl by letting out his own HOWL

Fjé6lnir falls silent as he sees Ashildurs old assistant
Hallur Freymundur hanging from the rafters upside down and
naked Blood spurts from a nasty cut in his neck It collects
in his gray beard and long hair and drips into a sacrificial
bowl on the altar He has been castrated and his genitals
lie in the puddle of blood in the bowl

Ashildur Hofgythja is tied up in the same blindfolded
position as Melkorka only bound by Hallurs intestines She
is below the body on the altar with her assistants blood
dripping all over her face She moans in terror

None of the three men Fj6lnir Hallgrimr or Thorir can

utter a word Fjélnir gestures to the men to help Ashildur

At a short distance from Fj6lnirs longhouse a flock of
ravens feasts on a pile of dog carcasses

Amleth and the other male slaves are lined up outside the
oxen shed faced by Fjélnirs usual armed henchmen along with
Gudrtin and Thorir The armed men are marked by last nights
fighting with the dogs wounded and bruised and full of
menace and ill will

FJOLNIR
Tonight you will be armed to defend
the farm for this is also your home
A secret evil has descended upon our
house It has killed noble men It has
turned our beasts against us

Hallgrimr Half-Troll walks along the line and picks out the
stronger men among the male slaves Amleth and the stronger
ones are walked to the side The others are sent back into
their stalls by Finnr Nose-Stub

FJOLNIR (CONTD)
Till we have smote this wickedness
your stalls will be bolted morning

women outside the byre

It is a still night shrouded in fog
Amleth is out in the field holding a sharpened pole of wood
for a weapon A rope is tied around his ankle and he is

tethered to a post secured in the ground a few feet away
like a goat used as bait for wolves

125

In front of him is the foggy ominous night At a distance to
his right there is AUDUNN THE IRISH (his face marred by the
knattleikr game) holding a pole and tethered in the same way
A third male slave in the same situation is on Amleths left
More tethered slaves recede into the fog Together the
strongest of the male slaves form a human barrier at the
farms periphery

Sitting at a safe distance by small fires closer to the
longhouse Fjé6lnirs armed men keep watch of the tethered
slaves

Finnr Nose-stub guards Amleth

Amleth turns his gaze to Finnr Nose-stub He looks at him
hard

Finnr Nose-stub is uncomfortable with being watched so as he
eats He turns his back to Amleth

When Finnr turns around again he doesn’t see Amleth He
falls back on his stool in fear and draws his sword

Amleth has untied himself and has now run behind Finnr again
Finnr turns around in a panic and struggles to his feet
Amleth is nowhere to be seen

Finnr then turns he sees something monstrous before him His
eyes widen he begins screaming laughing hysterically —
crying laughing and shaking uncontrollably due to his fly
agaric mushroom-induced hallucination

Another armed man comes running by fighting a hallucinatory
being He imagines the thing is on his chest and as he falls
to the ground he suddenly plunges his knife into his own
throat

A BURLY MAN tears his tongue out and waives it in the air
while he chokes on his own blood There is more screaming of
men in the distance

Amleth disappears into the fog

Finnr keeps laughing wildly rolling around on the ground

EXT LONGHOUSE ROOF MOMENTS LATER 128

Amleth sneaks along the longhouse roof with Draugr in his
hand

There are shouts and commotion coming from the farm

As Amleth makes his way he catches glimpses of the chaos
that the hallucinogenic mushrooms are causing among Fjdlnirs
armed men as they come in and out of the fog Some fight
each other while others stop in their tracks as they are
overcome with excessive vomiting

Fj6lnir Thorir and a handful of their sober men run into

further

Amleth looks at his mothers things He runs his fingers
through the fine robes and veils folded in an open chest He
touches the jewelry and boxes on her wooden carved vanity
table In a small box there is a lock of blonde baby hair
held together with an aging blue ribbon

On a silk cushion sits the headdress that Gudrtin wore at the
banquet on Hrafnsey Beside it is King Aurvandils GOLDEN
SERPENTINE RING shining by the flame of a stone lamp Amleth
TAKES the ring

He hears footsteps approaching the door to the master
bedroom

Amleth retreats hiding behind a carved post
Gudrtin steps into the room and closes the door securely She

goes to the table with the pitcher and the washing bowl

Amleth watches as his mother unties her hair so it flows down
her body

Gudrtin takes off her outer garments and is about to strip off
her long shift when she feels the blade of Draugr on her
throat Without moving her head Gudran glances along the
blade and meets Amleths eyes

Amleth keeps the blade steady she keeps her cool

GUDRUN
Your sword is long

Amleth breaks her off

AMLETH
Stop your jest I am your son

Gudrans throat so as not to harm her

Gudrin backs off away from Amleth and looks at him with
admiration and relief

survive till this moment Tomorrow

down over her left shoulder slipping her arm out of the
sleeve revealing a CRUDE BRANDING MARK on the skin below it

soothing voice

kill Thorir and if you are so
untamed as to kill my Gunnar

Amleth is stunned Then he tears himself away from her

Amleth is pulled back While kissing him Gudrtn got a grip
on his hand holding Draugr Amleth tries to break free but
Gudrtins grip is surprisingly strong

Amleth and Gudrin fight over the sword

Without hesitation Amleth raises Draugr high above his head
and stabs Thorir in his sleep The force plunges the blade
through Thorirs body and through the hall bench itself

The blade of Draugr comes bursting through the underside of
the bed its blood-soaked tip touching the floor below

As Amleth pulls Draugr back with a RINGING SOUND Thorir
wakes his eyes wide He looks at Amleth in horror at being

in the turf wall (a corpse-door) The bier is met by Fj6lnir
who is beyond himself with grief Gudrtin comes fast on his
heels holding Gunnar close to her

Fjé6lnir throws himself on Thdorirs dead body The bier falls
from the slaves hands to the ground Fjélnir crouches over
it crying silently in the mud

Gudrtin and the others look on with compassion Then Fjélnir
pulls himself away from Thdérirs body and shouts

heart

He thrusts his hand into the gaping wound on Thorirs breast
and rummages in it

FJOLNIR (CONTD)
His heart What evil is this What
kind of evil eats the hearts of brave
young men Freyr do you hear me

Gudrin throws herself on the ground as well It looks like
she is joining Fjélnir in his desperation Instead she
whispers in his ear fast and as cold as stone

biting rage for the mischief of last

Find the slaves who ally with him

All the slaves have been herded together and brought to the
front of the longhouse by Hallgrimr Finnr Nose-stub and
what is left of the armed men

Gudrtn pulls a long knife from inside her cloak and hands it
to Fj6lnir Fj6lnir steadies himself and walks to the group
of slaves

Hallgrimr Half-Troll orders the slaves down on their knees

FINNR THE NOSE-STUB
On your knees

The slaves get down on their knees When Fj6lnir reaches
them he grabs an ELDERLY MALE SLAVE by the hair forces his
head back and cuts his throat The blood spurts and Fjdélnir
lets go of him as the man falls to the muddy ground Fj6lnir
waves the long knife dripping with blood at the terrified
slaves 135

He wears his Arab amulet proudly He roars

toward Amleth

Amleth hangs the pouch from his belt and runs toward Fj6lnir 135

Gudrin shouts to Fjdélnirs men

GUDRUN
Kill him kill him

Before Amleth reaches Fj6lnir Fj6lnirs men attack Amleth
from all sides (Since it is daytime Amleth doesnt
unsheathe his enchanted sword )

In a scene that echoes King Aurvandils last moments Amleth

uses Draugr as a blunt object holding it like his father did
his sword in his final hour beating the attackers senseless

when he hits them in the head

With his berserker skills Amleth has the upper hand in the
fight BUT

in the chaos Amleth sees Olga as she sneaks away from
the group of slaves

SO when Amleth is sure Olga has made her escape he
starts allowing Fj6lnirs men to hit him harder and faster

Fj6lnirs men knock Draugr out of Amleths hands They throw
themselves on him like a pack of dogs bringing him down on
his knees forcing his hands behind his back

Fjé6lnir walks to him knife unsheathed He cuts the bloody
pouch loose from Amleth’s belt

He looks at Amleth with contempt
FJOLNIR
In the end youre just like your

father Evil begets evil

Amleth mutters something through his cracked and bloodied
lips

AMLETH
How how do you

Fj6lnir turns to Amleth
AMLETH (CONTD)
How how do you know it is your

sons heart

Amleth grins a bloody grin the rain beating down on his
face 135

AMLETH (CONTD)
-- and not the heart of a rabid dog
killed two nights ago

Fj6lnir screams in anger and stomps Amleth in the face
INT FJOLNIRS FARM BARN DAY 136

Amleth comes back to his senses He has been hoisted up in
the shadowy barn He hangs from the rafters by his tied
hands bare-chested bloodied and bruised One of his eyes
swollen shut

In front of Amleth are Fj6lnir and his men Finnr Nose-stub
is among them holding Draugr

Fj6lnir sees that Amleth has regained consciousness and
throws him several hard punches so that Amleth swings on the
rope

Amleth coughs and spits blood He looks at Fj6lnir with
utmost intensity

FJOLNIR
Where is it

AMLETH
You cannot kill me Even if you were
to strike me with your sword it would
not bite It is not my time I will
die in battle

This clearly frightens Fjélnir He throws Amleth another
punch

FJOLNIR
Where is my son’s heart

AMLETH
Odinn the All-Father will vanquish
your god of erections Fear him —

FJOLNIR
Silence

Fj6lnir smashes Amleth in the face again
FJOLNIR (CONTD)
I will come back for your heart

And your mother and I will eat it

Fj6lnir and his men leave the barn

136

Finnr Nose-stub is the last to leave He halts in the barn
door and tries to draw Draugr from its scabbard It is still
daytime so the sword doesnt yield He tries it again but
it remains stuck in the scabbard Finnr tears off the garnet-
decorated hanger for himself and throws the sheathed sword
into the barn like a piece of junk and closes the door

LATER EVENING 137

The blue of the twilight outside shines through cracks in the
ceiling

Still unconscious Amleth hangs from the rafters
IN A FLUTTERING OF WINGS a raven appears up on the rafter

It does its little raven jig and hops toward the spot where
the rope is tied around the wooden beam

It starts pecking at the rope A moment later another raven
appears on the rafter and joins in on the pecking

Amleth falls to the ground The ravens follow him to the barn
floor

There is more fluttering of wings More ravens come gliding
down from the rafters and join the first two ravens in
pecking at Amleth as carrion

Amleth regains consciousness and through a crack in his
eyes he sees the ravens flocking around him covering him
croaking and beating their wings
Amleth cries out in pain
AMLETH

Odinn let the Valkyrie your warrior

maiden fly me to your shining gates
As the beating of the ravens wings reaches a climax the
dark shadow of A GIANT HOODED FIGURE approaches eerily behind
Amleth
EXT FJOLNIRS FARM MOUNTAIN SIDE NIGHT 138

A simple DOOR FRAME has been erected outdoors as a ceremonial
entrance to a stone circle

Fjé6lnir’s men lift up Kormléth the slave so that her face
looks over the door frame

KORMLOTH
I see my father and mother

138

They lower her and then lift her again

KORMLOTH (CONTD)
I see my dead kindred

Again

KORMLOTH (CONTD)
I see my master in Freyja’s hall He
calls me to him

Men beat their shields and women ululate

Kormléth who is dressed beautifully and beyond her station
sings a mournful funeral song as she enters the stone circle
towards a small VIKING SHIP half-buried in the earth Iron
lamps on tall stands burn brightly Thorir is being buried
with all the pomp that befits one of his status

The tall wooden effigy of Freyr has been brought out of the
temple house and placed in a cart at the entrance of the
circle It is specially adorned for the funeral

Fj6lnir and his family stand outside the port side of the
ship He wears his priests bloody arm ring and shakes the
iron rattle GudrGn and Gunnar are by his side All are
overcome with sorrow

Ashildur Hofgythja stands on the ship’s deck with a
foreboding disposition She wears a ceremonial boar skin
cloak and presides over the funeral

Fj6lnirs men stand vigil outside the starboard side of the
boat MOURNING WOMEN led by Hallddéra kneel tossing their
hair wildly grabbing their breasts and clawing at their
faces moaning and wailing

Fj6lnir’s men kneel and Korml6th uses their palms as a
staircase to board the ship greeted by Ashildur Kormléth
passes earthly goods placed onto the ship Weapons brass
bowls casques of food offerings birds torn into pieces

Ashildur leads Kormléth to a bed where THORIR’S CORPSE LIES
Thorir is dressed in his best armor His nose and ears are
sealed with wax Ashildur lays a gilded sword on his chest
Ashildur then gives Kormléth a horn of drink

A HORSE HANDLER brings Thorirs horse Freyfaxi forward to
Fj6lnir holding his golden bridle Fj6lnir embraces the
beautiful horse tenderly and speaks into its ear 138

FJOLNIR
(in a low voice)
Tonight our mourning for Thorir ends

Fj6lnir steps back With a gentle command the horse handler
brings Freyfaxi down on its side The horse is calm Fjdélnir
unsheathes his sword

His men beat their weapons on their shields rhythmically
Kormléth’s singing grows louder

Fj6lnir gets ready to swing his sword Just then Gudrtn
pushed Gunnar forward

GUDRUN
Go on

GUNNAR
Father let me do it Thdorir was my
brother

Fj6lnir hesitates He looks at Gudrtn She bows Fj6lnir
hands Gunnar the sword Gunnar weighs the sword in his hands
It is heavy The shield banging and the singing grows louder
and louder

GUNNAR (CONTD)
May the neck-ale of this swift steed
hasten you to that highest tree of the
battle-weavers brother

With both hands he swings the sword (he hacks into the
horse’s neck OFF CAMERA)

The blood spurts on Gunnar

Gunnar yanks the sword loose and swings it again A thud is
heard as the horse’s head is separated from its body (OFF-
CAMERA)

The mourning women rush to the horses decapitated corpse and
collect the blood spurting from its open neck into big clay
bowls

Just then on the ship Kormlo6th’s singing is cut short
ASHILDUR STABS KORMLOTH IN THE CHEST THREE TIMES She lays
her body next to Thorir

The thick steaming blood is ritually poured over Thorir and
Kormléths bodies

Fj6lnir and Gunnar remove their cloaks and stand naked before
Gudrin (CAMERA show them from the waist up) 138

Gudrtin dips a branch in the blood like an aspergillum

GUDRUN
You now remain our only heir

She sprinkles it on her living family Blood sprays their
faces and bodies Fjdélnir touches his bloody arm ring

FJOLNIR
I swear by your own brothers death
that you’1ll not meet this selfsame
fate

GUDRUN
(to Gunnar)
It will never befall you
(to Fj6lnir)
Never

Gudrtin locks eyes with Fjélnir After a beat he turns to his
men and shouts with fury

FJOLNIR
My hour of grief has passed The time
of wrath-kindled revenge is upon us
Fj6lnir shakes his iron rattle Gudrin and the other women
ululate the men shout their war cries and beat their
weapons on their shields as fast as they can
INT FJOLNIRS FARM BARN NIGHT 139

Fj6lnir kicks the barn door open Amleth is gone The rope
lies in tatters on the ground

Fj6lnir is in shock

Suddenly he is overwhelmed with CROAKING and the FLUTTERING40

straight for the men

Fj6lnir and his men flee out of the barn The ravens dart out
and scatter into the night sky

EXT SOUTHERN ICELAND AND BEYOND PRE-DAWN 142
HOOF BEATS BLOWING WIND

MASSIVE HOOVES of a white horse beat the ground kicking up
black earth and dust

142

The RIDERS fine leather boots are adorned with golden spurs
that gleam in the moonlight The rider violently heels the
galloping steed onward

Amleth is half-covered in her cloak sitting sideways on the
horse unconscious and limp in front of the rider The rider
holds him close and steady with her muscular left arm — as if
he were a sleeping child — while holding the reigns of the
horse with her right spattered in blood to her elbow Her
long spear is tucked under her thigh

The rider is a VALKYRJA (Valkyrie) She is a Nordic warrior
deity — dressed in the threatening ornamented armor of her
kind Her iron war helm shines like glass Her red cloak is
smeared in gore and lined with fluttering swan feathers Her
hair is an icy wind Her face is fierce and beautiful —
angelic and demonic

The Valkyrja rides her horse through the mythic landscape of
Southern Iceland

The Valkyrja casts her blood-thirsty silver eyes ahead to
the cliff edge reflecting the light of a waxing moon shining
through wispy clouds

As they come closer to the cliffs edge the Valkyrja spurs
her horse ever harder and they gallop straight off of the
cliff into the void She screams a bone-chilling war cry —
like a bird of prey — her filed teeth inlaid with raven-black
resin

There is a MOMENT OF VERTIGO BUT 143
the Valkyrja rides the wind up into the sky

- AND as they climb up above the clouds where they reach
the silence of the starry night they are joined by other
Valkyrjur also carrying slain warriors on their horses far
in the distance wielding bloody swords and spears The
beating of their hooves is like thunder Their war cries are
a baleful sirens song

They are all headed for the same place a CITADEL at the end
of the Milky Way It glows with an eerie light VALHOLL

EXT HIDDEN VALLEY DAWN 144
Amleth wakes up He lies in a warm steaming mountain tarn
Some of his wounds are healed by the swirling blue water but

he is still very battered and bruised His eye is open and
his amulet is around his neck

144

It is dawn A white horse (much like the Valkyrja’s) grazes
nearby Through the steam Amleth sees the form of a woman
The steam shifts and reveals that it is Olga

Olga comes to Amleth holding a bundle of fresh clothes She
puts the clothes on the ground by the small hot spring

AMLETH
This is not Valholl

OLGA

I did not carry you that far I am no
Valkyrie The dreams of your afterlife
must wait Besides

She slips the dress off her body and steps into the water

OLGA (CONTD)
Im not done with you yet

EXT HIDDEN VALLEY EVENING 145

It is evening Amleth and Olga are dressed sitting by a
small open fire They share a simple meal of bread roasted
ptarmigan (Arctic grouse) and water Amleth is still nursing
his wounds

AMLETH

out my pledge of vengeance but my

And I thought I must shield my heart
always in stone I could not think I
would open it to a North man You
sacrificed yourself that I could
flee

AMLETH
And you came back for me

Olga gives him time to find the words to continue

145

AMLETH (CONTD)

I I have never felt close to
another person Not since I was a
child

She touches his face gently imagining him as that
traumatized child

OLGA
I curse your mother’s evil

If Amleth could cry he would with these next words

AMLETH
She murdered my past

Olga looks at him with hope
OLGA
Could it not be your Norns of Fate
have spun another thread for you to
follow

He wants it to be true

AMLETH
What do your Earth gods tell you
OLGA
That wherever I go I must take you
with me
AMLETH

I have kinsmen in Orkney We could
find safe passage there Together

OLGA
Yet I cannot truly believe that you
have extinguished your fire for
vengeance

Amleth hesitates

AMLETH
Hate is all I have ever known but I
wish I could be free of it

OLGA
That is for you to choose Let’s find
our future

She takes his hand They smile

feet behind Gudrtn

gray plume of smoke billows from Mount Hekla spreading ash
through the sky above

Amleth turns to Olga

Her cloak has slid down It exposes the nasty bruised cut on
her throat where Fj6lnir placed his knife

AMLETH
Your wound

OLGA
It is nothing to what we have endured
I have forgotten it already

Amleth unpins her shawl exposing her neck fully He touches
it gently He leans in to her

He can hear the pulse of her throat grow louder
Louder

He kisses her neck coming into contact with the cut on
Olgas throat

could trust that our child would be
safe

Stop this — there is now a living
thread that binds us

deeply in the eyes with love

quickly goes to Captain Volodymyr and puts it in his hand

much like when he beheaded Amleth’s father

But with his last bit of strength Amleth screams with
unknown rage

He rises attacking Fj6lnir both men on the offense swords
