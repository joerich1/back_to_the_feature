Young Edward bursts out into a clearing in the woods
towards the bright light

SUPER 20 YEARS LATER
EDWARD CARNBY (early 30s) lean and intense wakes up
quickly looks around to get his bearings
He sits in a large commercial airplane The compartment
full of seated PASSENGERS

SMALL BOY (age 8) sits next to Carnby looking up at
The Small Boys MOTHER (early 40s) sleeps next to him

SMALL BOY
Did you have a nightmare

Carnby looks at the Small Boy curious He doesnt

respond
SMALL BOY (CONTD)
You ate cheese with dinner My mommy says
cheese gives you nightmares Want to see
my coloring book
The Small Boy has a Halloween-themed coloring book open
on

his lap Its a graveyard scene full of cartoon
drawings of
ghosts werewolves and vampires

SMALL BOY (CONTD)
I think theres a vampire living in my
closet but my mommy says vampires and
ghosts arent real She says theres
nothing to be afraid of in the dark

Carnby weighs what hes going to say
CARNBY

Your mother is wrong Being afraid of the
dark is what keeps most of us alive

The Small Boys eyes open wide

SMALL BOY
Everybody else tells me not to be afraid

CARNBY
Thats because they dont know the truth

Carnby exits the Terminal and heads over to a row of

CARNBY (VO)
So maybe youre thinking Im an asshole
trying to scare this poor kid for no
reason But thats where youre wrong
Because Ive got my reasons Theres a
world around you that youve trained
yourself not to see Youve willfully
closed your eyes But your fear of the
dark is not a weakness Its there to
protect you from things youd better pray
you never see My eyes were forced open a
long time ago Now I know Just because
you cant see something doesnt mean it
cant kill you

before

Fischer pulls the spinal-worm out of Pinkertons open
back

dark

scales It has dozens of tiny clawed feet that were
connected

to Pinkertons spine

Sleek 713 assault rifles are lined up on a rack beside

They stand on either side of a counter A large
the wall behind them

CARNBY
Im not much for coincidences These
organisms must be connected to those
things from the museum

FISCHER
We call them xenomorphs

CARNBY
Catchy When did they first appear

With a remote control Fischer clicks through images on the
monitor as he talks He brings up a series of anatomical
schematics of the xenomorph creatures

FISCHER
Two years ago Theyve been 713s top
priority ever since But its been almost
exclusively in rural areas This kind of
urban infiltration is unprecedented

CARNBY
Have you isolated any weaknesses

Fischer brings up an image of the periodic table

FISCHER
Most metals pass right through them So
normal bullets and blades are useless
But theyre vulnerable to elements 76 to
79 Osmium iridium platinum and gold
Negates their ability to disrupt
electricity

CARNBY
If they disrupt electricity why did my
flashlight still work

FISCHER
The closer the current to its power
source the less disruption

Fischer takes a hand-held para-meter scanning device off a
rack It is a sleek updated version of Carnbys para-meter
similar to the Agents rifle-mounted scanners

FISCHER (CONTD)
This is calibrated to track their
disruption field It wont help you see
them but youll know when theyre
nearby

Fischer brings up a computer simulations of the creatures
disruption field displaying how it works

FISCHER (CONTD)
They live almost exclusively in darkness
Sunlights lethal in large doses But
only certain light frequencies hurt them

Fischer takes a rifle off the rack and lays it down on the
counter in front of them

Off another rack Fischer picks up a lamp He flips it
on and

off shining the bright blue beam around Fischer
snaps the

lamp into place at the top of the rifle

ISCHER (CONTD)
These lamps are set to an effective
frequency

Fischer takes out several magazines of ammo out of the
cabinet He discharges a bullet It glows yellow in

his hand

Something grabs the Agent SLAMS him back against the wall
and rips out his neck

Its another ORPHAN with the same fierce gaunt look and
clear irises

Burke turns away from Carnby for a moment trying to figure
out whats happening

Carnby suddenly lifts his weapon and points it at Burke
Burke sees this but before he can react Carnby FIRES

Carnbys bullet WHIZZES past Burke and hits an ORPHAN dead
center in the gut sending him flailing back dead The
Orphan was about to pounce on Burke

Theres a moment as Burke and Carnby look at one another
Burke realizes Carnby just saved his life

The ORPHANS attack

They are the grown-up Children from Carnbys Orphanage Like
Pinkerton they are difficult to kill immune to pain fast
and deadly They all have the same gaunt wild look with
sunken eyes and nearly clear irises

The Orphans leap out at the Agents quick and fierce They
bite and claw and use their superhuman strength to throw
around the Agents and tear them apart

collapses dead

Carnby checks the corpse The bullet came out the other

A mixture of red blood and black sticky ooze drips froma
bullet hole right over the Orphans spine

Carnby grabs the comm-link off the body of a dead Agent

Carnby Aline Barr and Burke step over the rubble of

They are in a large abandoned Bureau 713 Lab Thick

covers all surfaces But it was once a high-tech

On one side of the Lab is a sliding metal door

ALINE
What is this place

Medical equipment scientific instruments and

been left as they were untouched for two decades
A series of glass tubes are lined up along one wall
tube

a spinal-worm lies dead floating in gelatinous

Aline checks out a series of diagrams affixed to
wall They are anatomical schematics for the spinal-
There are also diagrams of the human body with
isolating key areas of the spinal cord

Carnby stands in front of a row of twenty clear glass

each about the size of a child

Each basin has a small metal tag on it Carnby wipes the
layer of dust off one of the metal tags
The tag reads E CARNBY

CARNBY
This is where it happened

Aline steps up next to Carnby
ALINE
Who did this to you

Burke and Barr continue to explore the room with their
rifle-

mounted lamps Barr finds a pair of huge metal hangar doors

AGENT BARR
Commander

Carnby Burke and Aline approach Barr at the hangar doors

Next to the hangar doors is a control panel Barr pulls the
front off the control panel revealing a rusted hand-crank

Barr pulls on the hand-crank It wont give Carnby joins
him

and together they strain to move the hand-crank The hand-

crank CLANKS into the open position

An old mechanism is engaged The hangar doors slide open
revealing another doorway behind them But this one is
clearly not part of the Lab

It is an ancient solid gold door carved with Abkani

symbols The gold door is built into a wall of rough rock
It

looks like the Lab was built right around the gold door

In the center of the door is a small cylindrical opening
A

line uses her flashlight to read the symbols on the door
One symbol is prominent among the others the DARK SPIRIT

ALINE
Edward look

Aline reaches into her pack and takes out the Abkani device
It is the exact size of the cylindrical opening in the door
The same DARK SPIRIT pictogram is engraved on the lynchpin

CARNBY
So its a key

Burke surveys the room with a grim expression
BURKE

I say we got two options One we open
this door deal with whatevers on the
other side

ALINE

The pictograms carved here make it pretty
clear thats a bad idea

BURKE
Two we set enough C-4 to bury this
place Keep whatevers in there down
here for good

Carnby stares at the gold door
CARNBY
The answers Ive been looking for my

whole life could be in there

ALINE
Some doors are locked for a reason

Carnby looks away from the gold door

CARNBY
Barr how much C-4 you got left

Barr pulls open his pack revealing several packages of C-4

AGENT BARR

Barr is cut off by a bullet hitting him in the head
Blood spurts out as Barr collapses to the ground dead

Hudgens stands behind them carrying two pistols

HUDGENS
Im afraid I cant allow that

Before they can react Hudgens presses a pistol to Alines
throat He points the other pistol at Burke and Carnby

HUDGENS (CONTD)
Now drop your weapons and back away

Carnby and Burke drop their guns and step back Carnby
glares

at Hudgens
CARNBY
It was 713

HUDGENS
Our early work was crude I admit But
eventually we perfected the implant
process You were our last failure
Carnby If you hadnt escaped 713 never
wouldve shut down the experiments
Burkes eyes flash with anger
BURKE
Theres no way this was sanctioned

HUDGENS
Before your kind took over 713 had very
different priorities Now you just

blaze in and destroy everything before we
can learn to control it Ive wasted
twenty years working in secret because of
short-sighted men like you

Hudgens sees the Abkani device Aline is holding

HUDGENS (CONTD)
There it is
Alines expression is firm unafraid She grips the device
tightly Hudgens is about to pull the trigger

HUDGENS (CONTD)
You were a fine archeologist

CARNBY
Aline

Hudgens turns to Carnby curious

CARNBY (CONTD)
Give him the key Enough people have died
today

Aline sees Carnby is serious She holds out the device to
Hudgens

HUDGENS
You couldnt have opened it anyway Not
without this

Hudgens takes out the hollow cylinder artifact he found on
the Erebus He hands it to Aline

Aline inserts the artifact into the hollow circular space at
the bottom of the device turning it into place The device
is now a full cylinder with a flat protrusion on the bottom
With one pistol pointed at Burke and Carnby and the other at
Aline Hudgens directs her to the gold door

HUDGENS (CONTD)
Insert the key
A

line inserts the device into the opening in the door

HUDGENS (CONTD)
Now turn it

Aline rotates the device using the flat protrusion on the
bottom It CLICKS into place

A small crack splinters away from the opening where the
device sits The crack splits off into several other cracks

Hudgens points his pistols at the others but his attention
is clearly directed at the gold door

HUDGENS (CONTD)
When we found the first of them 713 saw
just another threat to be eliminated But
I knew it was something more It was the
first The first to wake Ive woken
others since then But the rest are
coming

As Hudgens speaks Carnby Burke and Aline exchange a look
between them Carnbys eyes indicate the C-4 in Agent Barrs
pack Burke and Aline understand

The cracks splinter out dividing until they cover the
entire door In a rush of fragments the cracked gold
crumbles to the ground

The walls of the Cave are marked with hundreds and

of tunnels pocking the rock like a hive leading off

Hudgens moves into the Cave tentative but excited
Suddenly theres a SCRATCHING SCURRYING sound

A xenomorph creature emerges out of one of the tunnels
Out of another tunnel comes a second xenomorph And a
