She is a neighbor (Apt 6-B) and Joanna Kramers best
About four months ago Thelma and her husband Charley
divorced
Until then the two families had been very close the
son
(Billy) being about the same age as the Phillips
(Kim)
With the divorce however the Kramers tried to remain
with both Thelma and Charley and that has caused a
amount of friction
Thelma is an attractive woman in her mid-thirties She
well works out religiously at Jack LaLannes and goes
therapist twice a week She is also given to acting the
analyst with her friends Thelma is generous with her
sharing the wealth so to speak With all of this she is
loyal and a loving friend At the moment however she

THELMA
(looking around

suspiciously)
All right Whats going on
ON TED

From his attitude it is clear that there is no love
lost
between them

TED
All right Thelma you want to know
whats going on Ill tell you whats
going on Ill tell you exactly whats
going on

THELMA
Look Ted all I -

TED

(starting to really

roll)
I came home tonight We just got the
Fire and Ice account at the agency
Do you know what that means Do you
understand what that means It means
that it was maybe one of the five
best days in my whole life

THELMA
Ted all I wanted to know was where

TED
(not letting her get
a word in edgewise)
I walk in the house and before I can
say How are you Did you have a
nice day before I can say anything
Pow shes out the door

THELMA
OhmyGod Didnt she say anything
She mustve said something

TED

(sarcastic)
Yeah she said it wasnt any use

talking anymore

THELMA
Ted dont be so hostile

Ted draws himself upright with the dignity of the
Ambassador
to the Court of St James However during the
following he

begins pounding the pillows on the couch into shape
with

real vehemence

TED

Hostile

just want to know one thing okay
Just one thing Why Thats all I
want to know Why

THELMA
(how to say this)
Ted Joanna and I used to talk a lot
and well she told me a lot of
ah things about the two of you

TED
(instantly nervous)
Things What kind of things

THELMA
(clearly she knows
more than shes
willing to say)
I mean things Ted Joannas very
unhappy and -

(flash of anger)
Listen Joanna Kramers got a goddamn
good life Shes got a husband that
loves her Shes got a terrific kid
Shes got a wonderful home -

THELMA
(getting mad herself)
What dyou know about how Joanna
felt You went off to an office every
morning and youd come dragging home
at seven or eight every night and as
long as dinner was on the table you
thought everything was swell

TED
Did it ever occur to you guys that
Joanna Kramers not the easiest person
in the world to live with Did it
For one thing shes always thirty
minutes late You can set your watch
by it -

THELMA
(exasperated)
So shes late Whats the big deal
Thats just a way of saying Pay
attention to me

TED

(not listening)
Two She is getting to be a real
hermit or recluse or whatever it is
you call it Thelma do you know
where I could be in this business if
I had a wife that entertained or
went out socially -

THELMA
Oh for shits sake Ted you are the
most selfish human being I have ever
met No wonder she said you came
first then Billy then if there
was anything left over she got the
scraps

TED
Joanna said that

Thelma nods

TED
Then how come she never said anything
like that to me

THELMA
Maybe she didnt feel like she should
have to Maybe she felt like if youd
been paying any real attention to
her to start with maybe you wouldve
noticed

TED
(stung)
Boy you guys are really something
yknow Id like to know one thing
okay - just one little thing Did
you tell Joanna she should leave me

THELMA
(stiffly)
No

She turns and starts toward the front door Ted at her
heel

TED
Yknow something Thelma - you are
the typhoid Mary of divorce I mean
it Joanna and I never had any trouble
until you and Charley split up

THELMA
Ted divorce is a terrible thing I
know I went through it Youve got
to believe I did everything I could
to get Joanna to stay

(pause)

But Ill tell you something You may
not want to hear it but it took a
lot of courage for Joanna to do what
she just did

TED
Id like to know what the hell kind
of courage it takes to walk out on
your husband and your child

No pal Your mom loves you very
much The reason she left didnt
have anything to do with you
(pause this is very

painful)
Look dont know if this will make
any sense to you okay But Ill try
and explain You see the reason your
mom left was because Well I guess
it was because I kept trying to make
her into a certain kind of person
Make her be the way I thought a wife

this

shoulders

was supposed to be Only she wasnt
like that She was

(smiles to himself)
Well she wasnt like that And now
when I think about it I can see she
tried very hard to be like I wanted
— very hard And when she couldnt
then she tried to tell me about it
Only I wouldnt listen I guess I
thought that if I was happy that
meant she was happy too Only she
wasnt The truth is the only reason
she didnt leave a lot sooner was
because she loves you so much Joanna
stayed until she couldnt stand me
any longer and then she left But
it wasnt you pal It wasnt you

Clearly an enormous burden has been lifted from

important - I know the potential
revenue for the company inherent in
these programs

There is a long pause then

JOANNA

(speaking carefully

with great thought)
Yes Look during the last five
years we were married I had I
was getting more and more unhappy
more and more frustrated I needed
to talk to somebody I needed to
find out if it was me if I was going
crazy or what But every time I turned
to Ted - my ex-husband he couldnt
handle it He became very I dont
know very threatened I mean
whenever I would bring up anything
he would act like it was some kind
of personal attack Anyway we became
more and more separate more and
more isolated from one another
Finally I had no other choice I
had to leave And because of my ex-
husbands attitude — his unwillingness
to deal with my feelings I had come
to have almost no self-esteem
(with feeling)
At the time I left I sincerely
believed that there was something
wrong with me - that my son would be
better off without me It was only
when I got to California and started
into therapy I began to realize I
wasnt a terrible person And that
just because I needed some creative
and emotional outlet other than my
child that didnt make me unfit to
be a mother

GRESSEN
(to the judge)
Your honor I would like to place in
evidence a report on Mrs Kramers
therapy by her therapist Dr Elinore
Freedman of La Jolla California

And with that he hands both the judge and Shaunessy a
thick

sheaf of papers Then turning his attention back to
Joanna

GRESSEN
Mr Kramer why did you set up
residence in New York

JOANNA
Because my son is here And his father
is here As a mother I dont want
my child to be separated from his
father

GRESSEN
Mrs Kramer can you tell the court
why you are asking for custody
There is a pause then

JOANNA
Because hes my child Because I
love him I know I left my son I
know thats a terrible thing to do
Believe me I have to live with that
every day of my life But just because
Im a woman dont I have a right to
the same hopes and dreams as a man
Dont I have a right to a life of my
own Is that so awful Is my pain
any less just because Im a woman
Are my feelings any cheaper I left
my child - I know there is no excuse
for that But since then I have
gotten help I have worked hard to
become a whole human being I dont
think I should be punished for that
I dont think my son should be
punished for that Billys only six
He needs me Im not saying he doesnt
need his father but he needs me
more Im his mother

There is a beat of silence then

GRESSEN
Thank you Mrs Kramer I have no
further questions

ON SHAUNESSY

As he stands collects his papers from the table and
taking
his own sweet time crosses to Joanna

SHAUNESSY
Now then Mrs Kramer you said you
were married seven years Is that
correct

JOANNA
Yes

SHAUNESSY

ever strike you or abuse you
physically in any way
JOANNA
No

SHAUNESSY
Did your husband strike or physically
abuse his child in any way

examination

Joanna has been very forthright very sure of herself
Now

as he starts getting tougher she begins to falter

SHAUNESSY
Permanently

Somewhere in between

SHAUNESSY

Objection

SHAUNESSY
(to the judge)
Your honor I would request a direct
answer to a direct question Does

JUDGE
Ill allow that The witness will
answer please

JOANNA
(in a whisper)
Yes

SHAUNESSY
Is that permanent

JOANNA
(by now she is becoming
thoroughly rattled)
I I dont know

SHAUNESSY
Then we dont really know do we
when you say permanently if youre
planning to remain in New York or
even to keep the child for that
matter since youve never really
done anything in your life that was
continuing stable that could be
regarded as permanent

ON THE PETITIONERS TABLE
Gressen jumps to his feet

GRESSEN
Objection I must ask that the counsel
be prevented from harassing the
witness

JUDGE
Sustained

SHAUNESSY

Mrs Kramer how can you consider
yourself a fit mother when you have
been a failure at virtually every
relationship you have undertaken as
an adult

GRESSEN
(red in the face)
Objection
JUDGE
Sustained
SHAUNESSY

Ill ask it another way What was
the longest personal relationship
you have had in your life - other
than parents and girlfriends

JOANNA
(rattled)
Ah I guess Id have to say
with my child

SHAUNESSY
(wonder irony)
Whom youve seen twice in a year
Mrs Kramer your ex-husband wasnt
he the longest personal relationship
in your life

JOANNA
(reluctantly)
I suppose
SHAUNESSY

Would you speak up Mrs Kramer I
couldnt hear you

JOANNA
(louder)
Yes

SHAUNESSY
How long was that

JOANNA
We were married two years before the
baby And then four very difficult
years

SHAUNESSY
So you were a failure at the longest
most important relationship in your
life

GRESSEN
Objection

JUDGE
Overruled

JOANNA

I was not a failure

SHAUNESSY
(sarcastic)
Oh What do you call it then -a
success The marriage ended in
divorce

JOANNA
(so angry she forgets
her cool)
I consider it less my failure than
his

SHAUNESSY
(seizes on this)
Congratulations Mrs Kramer You
have just rewritten matrimonial law
You were both divorced Mrs Kramer

GRESSEN

Six years Ever since Ted and Joanna
moved into the building
SHAUNESSY

How often do you see Mr Kramer and
his son
THELMA

(to the judge by way

of explanation)
Charley my husband and I are
divorced and Kim thats our daughter

INT COURTROOM - DAY
ON TED KRAMER
Sitting in the witness stand

SHAUNESSY
Mr Kramer would you tell the court
exactly why you want to retain custody
of your child

TED

(speaking quietly)
When Joanna -

(to the judge

correcting himself)
- my ex-wife - when she was talking
before about how unhappy she was
during our marriage Well I guess
most of what she said was probably
true There were a lot of things I
didnt understand - a lot of things
I would do different if I could
Just like I guess there are a lot of
things Joanna wishes she could
change But we cant Some things
once they are done cant be undone
Joanna says she loves Billy I believe
she does So do I But the way it
was explained to me thats not the
issue The only thing thats supposed
to matter here is whats best for
Billy When Joanna said why
shouldnt a woman have the same
ambitions as a man I suppose shes
right But by the same token what
law is it that says a woman is a
better parent simply by virtue of
her sex I guess Ive had to think a
lot about whatever it is that makes
somebody a good parent constancy
patience understanding love
Where is it written that a man has
any less of those qualities than a
woman Billy has a home with me
Ive tried to make it the best I
could Its not perfect Im not a
perfect parent

(unconsciously echoing

something Joanna

said earlier)
I dont have enough patience
Sometimes I forget hes just a little
kid But I love him More than
anything in this world I love him

SHAUNESSY

CUT TO
INT LOBBY — DAY
ON THE ELEVATOR DOORS
As they open Ted steps out looks around
HIS POV
The lobby is dark the only light coming from the
window
Joanna sits off to one side wearing sunglasses She
looks
up as Ted approaches a small smile on her face
TED
(abrupt)
Okay Im here Now why did you -
JOANNA
Ted do you love him
TED
Goddamnit Joanna What the -
JOANNA
(insistent)
Ted do you love him
He nods
JOANNA
I love him too I dont think I
ever knew how much until now
There is a long pause as she looks at Ted unable to
speak

Finally

JOANNA

(a deep breath then)
Ted when we got married it was
because I was twenty-seven years old
and I thought I should get married
and when I had Billy it was because
I thought I should have a baby
and I guess all I did was mess up my
ON TED

Struck by

life and your life and -

TED
Joanna what the hell is -

JOANNA
(urgent)
Please Please dont stop me This
is the hardest thing Ive ever had
to do

the urgency in her voice

JOANNA
After I left when I was in
California I began to think what
kind of mother was I that I could
walk out on my own child It got to
where I couldnt tell anybody about
Billy - I couldnt stand that look
in their faces when I said he wasnt
living with me Finally it seemed
like the most important thing in the
world to come back here and prove to
Billy and to me and to the world how
much I loved him And I did And

I won Only it was just another
should

(she begins to break

down)

Sitting in that courtroom Hearing
everything you did everything you
went through Something happened

I guess it doesnt matter how much I
love him or how much you love him

I guess its like you said the only
thing that counts is whats best for
Billy I dont know maybe thats

all love is anyway Ted I think
Billy should stay with you

TED
(stunned)
What

JOANNA
(she reaches out
takes his hand)
Hes already got one mother he
doesnt need two Hes yours
(her last ounce of

reserve crumbles)
I wont fight you for him any more
Hes yours

TED
Oh God Oh my God

JOANNA
Only can I still see him

TED
No more waiting in Coffee Shops I
promise

Joannas last ounce of reserve crumbles she begins to
sob

Ted puts his arms around her and holds her They do not
kiss

Then after a few moments she steps back

JOANNA
(chin high)
Okay I think Ill go talk to my
son now
(wiping her eyes)
How do I look

TED
Beautiful

They step into the elevator and as the doors close
blocking

them from view we
DISSOLVE TO

EXT STREET — DAY

ON TED AND BILLY

TRACKING JUST IN FRONT OF THEM as they walk to the

park

They are deep in conversation although we are too far
away

to bear what they are saying HOLD ON THEM and as they
reach

the entrance to the park Billy first then Ted begin
to

run overwhelmed with the sheer joy of being alive of
being
together As they continue to run THE CAMERA PULLS

BACK AND

UP AND WE SEE that they are only two among thousands of

parents and children in Central Park on a sunny
afternoon

THE CAMERA CONTINUES TO PULL BACK until they are lost
from

view and it is

FADE

OUT

THE END
