INT MANAGERS OFFICE- DAY 1

A young man Cassius Green is being interviewed for a job at
a telemarketing firm The interviewer looks over a lengthy
résumé In his lap Cassius proudly holds a large plaque with
the words “Employee Of The Month- Cassius Green” engraved on
it

ANDERSON
Wow You’ve really gone the extra
mile by lugging that in here

CASSIUS
Yes sir That’s my style

ANDERSON
Admirable Your resume is
startlingly impressive as well
Most people just fill out the
application You were actually the
manager of the Rusty Scupper
restaurant for 5 years

CASSIUS
Yes

ANDERSON
Then you worked as a teller for
Bank Of America for 2 years from
‘04 to ‘06 with a 6 month overlap
with the restaurant

CASSIUS
Mmmhmm
ANDERSON
Oh And it says here you were

employee of the month

Cassius makes a Vanna White-style hand motion toward his
plaque

ANDERSON (CONTD)
What’s that trophy in the bag
there

Cassius pulls out a tall trophy and places it on the desk
CASSIUS

Oakland High Moot Court Champion
I’m a salesman at heart
White 51717 2

ANDERSON
Intriguing Mainly because I was
bank manager at that particular B
of A from 2003 to 2005 And you
Mr Green never worked there I
also called the number you gave for
The Rusty Scupper Was that your
friend Salvador’s number

Cassius nods

ANDERSON (CONT’D)
The same Salvador that also applied
here

Cassius sees Salvador through the window giving a “thumbs
up”

CASSIUS
I didn’t know he applied here too

ANDERSON
It would of been smart if his
outgoing message didn’t say “I’m
Sal bitches” So that plaque and
the trophy Did you steal them

CASSIUS
I made them Well had them made I
just- I just really need a job

ANDERSON
Alright Cassius Green Listen
This is telemarketing We ain’t
fuckin’ mappin’ the human genome or
finding fucking alternative fuel
sources I don’t care whether you
have work experience I’1l hire
damn near anybody That bootleg
plaque proves two things I need to
know- you have initiative and you
can read You will call as many
contacts as you can during your
shift and you will read the script
that we give you And you will show
up to work tomorrow Happy

CASSIUS
Thank you Mr Anderson

Cassius stands and tries to shake Anderson’s hand but is
instead handed a training script a small pamphlet of papers
White 51717 3

ANDERSON
Cassius one more thing Stuss

CASSIUS
(confused)
Stuss

Without looking at it Anderson points to a big butcher paper
sign on the wall that reads “STTS Stick To The Script”
written in marker

ANDERSON
Stuss STTS Stick to the
script
INT CASSIUS’S STUDIO APARTMENT-— MORNING 2

Cassius and his girlfriend Detroit lay in bed in a very
small studio apartment On the nightstand there is a faded
sepiatone 1980s photograph of a sharply dressed man posing in
front of a Lincoln Continental The man has a very proud
expression on his face Cassius stares at the ceiling while
Detroit lays her head in his chest

CASSIUS
Hey Detroit You ever think about
dying

DETROIT

Yeah sometimes

CASSIUS
I’m not talking about dying right
now like in an accident or
something I mean like when we’re
old Like 90 I think about it all
the time What will I have done
that’s important that matters

DETROIT
I just want to make sure that when
I die I’ll be surrounded by people
who love me and who I love back

CASSIUS
What about when those people die

DETROIT
What do you mean

CASSIUS
At some point we’re gonna die our
kids and grand kids are gonna die
(MORE )
White 51717 4

CASSIUS (CONTD)
At some point no one will even
know you existed All life will end
on this planet and in billions of
years the sun will explode Nothing
I’m doing will have mattered

DETROIT
Baby it’ll always matter Because
it matters now This moment all of
these moments When I kiss you
it’s not for posterity’s sake

CASSIUS
I mean you found your calling
though Your art means something
But I’m just surviving Spinning my-

DETROIT
Ay Stop You missed your cue I
said When I kiss you it’s not

for posterity’s sake

Detroit kisses Cassius and the couple begins to make out
Soon they are both naked All of a sudden the wall abruptly
swings upward- we see for the first time that this studio
apartment is really a semi-converted garage bordering the
sidewalk— leaving the romantic couple exposed to the street
and passersby Cassius jumps up to close it while pulling his
sweatpants up

DETROIT (CONT’D)
Fuck Cassius I thought you fixed
that

CASSIUS
My landlord was supposed to

STREET VOICE (0S)
Get a room

CASSIUS
Muthafucka I GOT a room

As Cassius pulls the garage door closed and secures it his
sweatpants start to fall Detroit smiles lovingly at this
Cassius pulls the sweats up and sits back down on the bed
Detroit gets up and walks toward the bathroom

DETROIT
I gotta get to work anyway Don’t
you start work today

CASSIUS
Yeah
White 51717 5

Detroit walks off-screen into the bathroom

CASSIUS (CONTD)
If you want a second job they said
they hire anybody You could try
part-time

Cassius turns on the TV and sits back down A commercial
starts up

MAN ON TV (VO)
Everyone is talking about the
Worryfree solution Worryfree is
the revolutionary new business and
lifestyle model taking the world by
storm

DETROIT (0S)
What are they paying you

Cassius is transfixed on the TV

MAN ON TV (VO)
When you sign a Worryfree contract
you’re guaranteed employment AND
housing for life Stop worrying
get Worryfree The Worryfree living
quarters are state of the art

TV shows a chic looking room with 6 bunk beds like a prison
done up by a hip interior decorator

MAN ON TV (VO
The Worryfree food is to die for

TV shows a gigantic dining room with thousands of people in
uniforms at long tables with chandeliers hanging overhead

MAN ON TV (VO) (CONTD)
and Worryfree careers are
fulfilling and satisfying

DETROIT (0S)
Cash baby what are they paying
you

CASSIUS
(Still staring at TV)
Uh I think it’s just commission
You ever thought about that
Worryfree shit

DETROIT
Are you crazy
White 51717 6

CASSIUS
(staring at TV)
What for working on commission
(looking up at Detroit)
Nice earrings

We see now that DETROIT’S oversize earrings are big two-
dimensional gold metallic block letters Her right earring
reads MURDER MURDER MURDER Her left one KILL KILL KILL

EXT CASSIUS’S STUDIO APARTMENT- MORNING 3

CASSIUS exits his apartment through the side door and locks
it He is spotted by his landlord SERGIO who is wearing a
necklace with an oversized gold cross which has a Jesus with
a frightfully pained face This particular Jesus seems to be
screaming and writhing in agony

SERGIO
Ay Cash I got overdue house-
notes dude How much longer do I
have to wait for my money

CASSIUS
Hey Serge I got a job now I
start today so I’ll have your
money soon

SERGIO
Damn man It’s 4 months late now
It’s like “soon” is the only
fuckin’ word I hear from you

CASSIUS
OK I’m 4 months late But you
should be ashamed This land was
created- by God- for us all but
greedy asses like you horde it for
yourself and your family and charge
the people for the right to live

SERGIO
Me and my family Cassius I’m your
fucking uncle Bank might take my
fucking house Four fucking months
I gave you the car you’re driving

CASSIUS
It’s a damn bucket

SERGIO
Oh yeah Give it back then No
That’s what I thought

(MORE )
White 51717 7

SERGIO (CONTD)
That car is better than your shoes
I need my money in two weeks
asshole

EXT GAS STATION- DAY 4

CASSIUS drives his car to the gas station It’s a red 1982
Honda Civic with a gray primered hood and doors The car is
very loud—maybe missing a muffler—and has steam coming from
the radiator CASSIUS walks to the cashier’s window

CASSIUS
(through window)
Gimme forty on two

Cashier looks down at the forty cents Cassius has left and
looks back at Cassius and the car disapprovingly

EXT STREET- DAY 5

CASSIUS drives through the city He passes a group of adult
men playing football They are wearing Oakland High School
jerseys but they’re obviously not in high school—some of
them have beards others have beer guts CASSIUS honks his
horn rapidly and repeatedly as he passes They all look Many
wave

VARIOUS FOOTBALL PLAYERS
Ay Cash What up

CASSIUS
(yelling sing-song)
O-High Play-ers

CASSIUS gives the clenched-fist-pull acknowledgment and keeps
driving

He passes a mural-size street-level billboard that shows a
side view of a five-bed bunk beds with people in each bed
They all look very comfortable Two of them are sleeping One
of them is reading a book Another is laughing while watching
television in his bunk The one in the middle smiles widely
looking straight into camera giving a thumbs-up Caption
“WORRYFREE IF YOU LIVED THERE YOU’D BE AT WORK ALREADY”

INT OFFICE BUILDING LOBBY- DAY 6

CASSIUS enters the office building As he walks toward the
telemarketing offices he sees a MAN IN A FANCY SUIT use a
key to summon an elevator The elevator doors are gold with
hieroglyphics on them—1920s-era faux-Egyptian style
White 51717 8

When the elevator opens we see velvet-upholstered walls and a
chandelier This is a ridiculously luxurious and gaudy
elevator There seems to be a purple glow emanating from
inside The MAN IN A FANCY SUIT smiles at CASSIUS while
entering the elevator Cassius seems puzzled but continues
on his way to work

INT TELEMARKETING CUBICLES- DAY 7

CASSIUS is led into a room where a racially mixed group of
about one hundred people sit at cubicles Black East Asian
South Asian Latino and White Many of the White callers
look “punk” Leading him JOHNNY wearing shirt and tie His
face is tattooed and he has a Mohawk They pass two
technicians who are trying to fix a copy machine that
sputters out a few sheets of paper to the floor as they pass
They pass SALVADOR who’s on a call but gives CASSIUS a
thumbs up The walls are covered with multi-colored
electrical wires in a criss-cross fashion

JOHNNY
This is where the magic happens
Millions of dollars went into these
walls to make sure that thousands
of calls can go out and in at the
same time without jamming the
lines Clock in here Grab a seat
You studied the script

CASSIUS
Yeah

Cassius sits at a cubicle He sees a wall with several framed
old photos of the same man one on a phone another receiving
a phone-shaped trophy one meeting Ronald Reagan and one
with him receiving a lap dance Above the photos “Hal
Jameson Wall Of Glory”

Cassius takes out and unfolds a photocopy of the picture from
his nightstand and tacks it to the wall of the cubicle

JOHNNY
Look Clock in don’t be lazy hit
your contacts bring in some money
and I won’t have to be an asshole
Do real good eventually you might
be able to be a Power Caller

CASSIUS
What’s a Power Caller

Johnny points at the ceiling

White 51717 9

JOHNNY
Where the callers are ballers
Where they make the real money
They have their own elevator

CASSIUS
Oh yeah I saw that

JOHNNY
(walking away)
And stick to the script

Cassius puts the headset on and clicks the computer keyboard
A name pops up and we hear it ring

INT DINING ROOM- DAY 8

We see a man sitting at the dinner table with his family We
hear the phone ring

INT TELEMARKETING CUBICLES- DAY 9

Cassius with headset at the desk The phone is still ringing
As the phone picks up Cassius and his desk shake and fall

straight down out of frame Cassius and his desk land in the
dining room with the man and his family The man is annoyed

INT DINING ROOM- DAY 10

MAN EATING DINNER
Yello

CASSIUS
(Reading script in a very
stiff manner)

Phone hangs up Cassius and desk raise up leaving Cassius
back in the Telemarketing Cubicles

INT TELEMARKETING CUBICLES-— DAY 11
Another name flashes on the screen and we hear it ring As it

picks up Cassius and his desk crash into a living room On
the couch there is a woman and man naked having sex

White 51717 10

INT LIVING ROOM- DAY 12

WOMAN ON COUCH

CASSIUS

Phone hangs up Cassius and desk raise up again leaving
Cassius back in the Telemarketing Cubicles

INT TELEMARKETING CUBICLES- DAY 13

Cassius stares at the screen waiting for the next name to
appear As he waits behind Cassius- where the technicians
and now Johnny are fixing the copy machine- the copy machine
starts wildly shooting paper everywhere as Johnny and the
technicians frantically try to get a handle on the situation

Name flashes on screen it rings As it picks up Cassius
crashes down into a darkened kitchen There is a woman
sitting at the table She looks very sad

INT KITCHEN- DAY 14

WOMAN AT TABLE
Hello

CASSIUS
Hey Mrs Costello

WOMAN AT TABLE
Yes

INT TELEMARKETING CUBICLES- DAY 15

Cassius looks up at a banner that says “Stick To The Script”
He then looks at the script which says “1 Introduce
yourself Be their friend”

INT KITCHEN- DAY 16

CASSIUS
This is Cassius Green I’m with
Insight Encyclopedias and I know
you’ve enjoyed our Insight
Birdwatching books so I just
wanted to help you out-

White 51717 11

WOMAN ON PHONE
I’m sorry young man we don’t have
any money My husband is in the
hospital he’s 83 with stage 4
cancer and we-

Mrs Costello continues starting to sob and then wailing

INT TELEMARKETING CUBICLES- DAY 17

Cassius looks at the banner-

INT KITCHEN- DAY 18

-then down at his script He flips pages frantically through
the pamphlet “5 Make any problem a selling point ‘Well
Mr Smith it’s interesting that you say that because”

CASSIUS
Well Mrs Costello It’s- It’s
interesting that you say that
because book number five in the
Insight series is all about
wellness and how to stay healthy on
your own without even going to the
Doctor

Phone hangs up leaving Cassius back in the Telemarketing
Cubicles

INT TELEMARKETING CUBICLES- DAY 19

Cassius is exasperated Behind him the papers are still
shooting into the air from the copy machine- filling the
frame until there is a wall of flying papers behind him

INT BAR- EVENING 20

Evening After work Cassius and Salvador are sitting ina
booth drinking at a small ratty bar They’ve got their
scripts on the table Cassius is dispirited

CASSIUS
I feel incompetent and like an
asshole doing this job

SALVADOR
I don’t feel different than usual

White 51717 12

They see a man in a leather jacket talking to a bouncer who
is sitting in front of a door at the back of the bar

SALVADOR (CONTD)
Ay Ain’t that dude from that show

CASSIUS
Oh hell yeah That’s him That’s
hella cool I hate that show

The bouncer opens the door and the man in the leather jacket
goes through it

CASSIUS (CONT’D)
What’s that room I never noticed
it before

SALVADOR
That’s the VIP room

A young couple wearing formal attire talk to the bouncer and
go through the door

CASSIUS
What the hell is this place doing
with a VIP room

SALVADOR
Don’t knock it I used to be in
there all the time But I’d rather
hang with the common folk

CASSIUS
What qualifies you to be VIP
SALVADOR
You need the password This week
it’s “upscale elegance” Well

it’s always “upscale elegance”

CASSIUS
I’m goin’

Cassius walks over to the bouncer with his drink talks to
him and goes through the door

INT VIP ROOM- EVENING 21
This is a tiny ten-by-ten room with leather bench seats

around the perimeter and a very small tiled dance floor in
the center At most four people can fit on the dance floor

White 51717 13

The back wall has a little service chute- like a small
dumbwaiter- above the seat The chute door is closed

There are neon lights on all the walls and flashing disco
lights on the ceiling

The music is very loud in the VIP room

The man in the leather jacket the couple we saw earlier a
guy in a track suit and two other women holding drinks are
seated bobbing their heads to the music

Cassius still holding his drink squeezes into the empty
seat between the track suit guy and the two women bobbing
his head as well It is very crowded

The service chute opens and a very colorful cocktail with an
umbrella is there with some change

The man in the leather jacket grabs the drink dancing and
leaning over Cassius- forcing him to quickly turn to the side
to avoid the man’s inadvertent crotch in his face

Turning his head makes Cassius look directly at one of the
two women on his side She subtly laughs at him and he
reacts by making an overly “cool” and flirty face

Just then the track suit guy stretches out by laying his arm
over the top of the bench seat as he talks to the couple
Cassius is uncomfortable with this but- instead of saying
anything- leans toward the two women to make some space

Four more people come in one sitting and making Cassius
visibly physically uncomfortable Three of the others dance
It is crazy crowded in there

Cassius sips on his drink while still looking at the woman
next to him and trying to look cool but the ass of an
unidentified dancer bumps his drink- spilling it all over his
face and shirt

Cassius politely gets up and leaves

INT BAR- EVENING 22

Cassius walks back to the booth where Salvador is still
drinking and sits down his shirt still wet from the spill

CASSIUS
That was some player shit
White 51717 14

23 INT TELEMARKETING CUBICLES- DAY 23

CASSIUS comes in to start a new workday script in hand He
sits at a cubicle next to an older black man

LANGSTON
Hey youngblood

CASSIUS
Ay w’sup

LANGSTON

Lemme give you a tip Use your
White voice

CASSIUS
My White voice

LANGSTON
Yeah

CASSIUS

But I don’t have a White voice

LANGSTON
Come on youngblood You know what
I mean You have a White voice in
there that you can use Like when

CASSIUS
I use my same voice For real Like
“Back the fuck up off the car and
nobody gets hurt”

LANGSTON
Aight I’m tryna give you some
game You wanna make money here
Read the script with a White voice

CASSIUS
Ok People say I talk White anyway
though so why isn’t it working

LANGSTON
Well you don’t talk White enough
I’m not talkin’ bout Will Smith
White- that’s not even White
that’s just proper I’m talkin the
real deal

CASSIUS
(sounding very nasally while
pinching nose) Hello Mr Kramer
(MORE )

White 51717

CASSIUS (CONTD)
I’m Cassius Green Sorry to bother
you-

LANGSTON
No You got it wrong It’s not
about sounding all nasal It’s
about sounding like you don’t have
a care Like your bills are paid
and you’re happy about your future
and you’re about to jump in your
Ferrari when you get off this call
Put some extra breath in there
Breezy like you don’t need this
money like you never been fired
only laid off It’s not what all
White people sound like- there
ain’t no real White voice but it’s
what they wish they sounded like
It’s what they think they’re
supposed to sound like Like this
youngblood

(overdub by a White actor)
Hey Mr Kramer This is Langston
from Regalview I didn’t catch you
a bad time did I

INT MEETING ROOM- DAY

We see a crowded meeting room with dry-erase boards on the
walls All the callers are sitting in folding chairs Three

Managers stand in front of the room They are Anderson

Johnny and a woman named Diana

JOHNNY
Sales are low Let’s look at why
This graph shows the disgusting
lack of contacts reached You’re
talking too long to these assholes
If you’re ever gonna be a Power
Caller you gotta know when to bag
‘em and when to tag ‘em

Salvador raises his hand

SALVADOR
Uh what’s bagging and what’s
tagging

JOHNNY

Good question Bagging is when you

drop the call Like a dead body

into a bag you know You drop that

shit cause it crossed the line
(MORE )
White 51717 16

JOHNNY (CONTD)
Tagging is when you claim that
money It’s a sale Ch-ching You
tag it You claim it like when
they put the tag on the body at the
morgue to identify it Or- you
might bag a dead body and be about
to walk away from it and get out of
town to lay low and then instead
just drag that heavy fucker on into
the alley and THEN tag it That’s
when you’re really good

All of the callers and managers are silent and look confused

ANDERSON
Johnny- those aren’t authorized
metaphors for this pep rally Ok
Diana

DIANA
Hi Everyone I’m new here so
forgive me if I don’t know all of
your names

Diana writes her name on the dry-erase board It reads “Diana
DeBauchery”

DIANA (CONT’D)
My name is Diana Dee-bo-sher-ree

SALVADOR
Looks like debauchery to me

DIANA

It’s not

(Extremely cheerful)
Anywho I’m one of your new Team
Leaders You’re like “Team
Leader I thought she was a

motorized appendages”

Blank stares

billboard from earlier the one with the bunk bed and the guy
giving a thumbs-up It’s been altered with spray paint
stencil and wheat-pasted paper The people in beds are now
wrapped in chains There’s a yellow caution sign The caption
now reads “WORRY SLAVERY AT WORK” It’s signed “LEFT EYE”

and starts to pull rhythmically left and right manually
making the wipers work

SALVADOR

DETROIT

audience screaming the words out loud

GAME SHOW AUDIENCE

We see a montage of contestants getting beaten with paddles
swimming in a trough of greenish-brown sludge being pelted
with baseballs via a pitching machine- all with laugh tracks
playing Contestants seem to be afraid or in a lot of pain

A jacket and a newspaper The newspaper headline reads
“Senate Committee Clears Worryfree Of ‘Slavery’ Charges”

Langston signals the bartender for another drink The
bartender reaches for one of two identical oversized bottles
of Jack Daniels Whiskey

LANGSTON
Nuh uh man I want the good shit

The bartender reaches for the other of the two identical Jack
Daniels bottles Leaving it on the shelf he opens the facade
of the bottle- as if it were a door It’s actually a bottle-
shaped compartment holding a much smaller bottle The inner
walls of the compartment are wood-grained There’s a light
illuminating the smaller bottle Bartender grabs smaller
bottle pours a neat glass for Langston Cassius watches

SQUEEZE
Hey Detroit Nice earrings

Detroit has changed earrings They are now gold metallic
figurines of a hooded man strapped to an electric chair

CASSIUS
You changed earrings

The camera focus changes away from one of Detroit’s earrings
to reveal a large billboard across the street behind her
just above a wall of white smoke from the cars burning rubber
on the street The billboard shows a picture of a Black man
sitting on a couch with a remote control

White 51717 30

He is in exactly the same position as the figurine of the
hooded man in the electric chair Caption under the picture
big block letters “Show the world that you are a RESPONSIBLE
Babydaddy Sign your family up for WorryFree- NOW” The white
burnt rubber smoke rises fills the frame covers the
billboard

EXT STREET- MORNING 37

The smoke clears It is morning and the billboard from the
night before has been altered by street artists The man on
the couch is now a a Huey-Newton-like figure holding guns
and wearing a black beret The caption has been altered using
spray paint and flat white paint It reads “Show the world
your RESPONSE baby Freedom NOW” It’s signed “Left Eye”

Camera pans down the street to see Cassius’s car puttering
toward us Detroit in the passenger seat looks up at the
billboard and smiles

As they drive many people are living in their cars vans and
RVs A man in an inexpensive suit brushes his teeth in a car
which he is obviously living in Some houses have WorryFree
moving containers in front reading “THIS FAMILY CHOSE
WORRYFREE” A book store window filled with Steve Lift’s
book “I’m On Top” The cover Steve Lift sitting on a horse

EXT STREET CORNER- DAY 47

Detroit stands alone at dusk on a street corner twirling a
sign in the shape of an arrow that reads “Signs” She stops
twirling the sign intermittently to point it towards the
store she is standing next to which has a big lit up sign on
it that also reads “Signs” Apparently they’re selling
signs Detroit is looking down the street hoping that Cassius
will show soon She is wearing gold mettallic block letter
earrings that on her right side read “Bury The Rag” and on
her left side read “Deep In Your Face”

A car pulls up It’s Squeeze He rolls down the window and
yells out

SQUEEZE
Ay baby What’s your sign
DETROIT
(looks and laughs)

Pffft

Squeeze gets out and walks toward Detroit who’s smiling and
continues to twirl the sign

DETROIT (CONTD)
That was fucking crazy yesterday
Like a scene out of Norma Rae

SQUEEZE
Regalview’s scared shitless We’1l
win
(referring to the sign)
Can I check that out

Detroit shrugs and hands him the sign Squeeze starts
twirling the sign in the air around his back doing some
amazing dance moves while he is doing it Detroit slyly
checks him out The display of talent makes her smile from
ear to ear A car honks

DETROIT
Bravo Where’d you learn that

SQUEEZE
Down in LA We organized the first
sign twirlers union there
White 51717 39

DETROIT
That’s what you do Go from place
to place stirring up trouble

As they talk the sign is continually spun between them

SQUEEZE
The trouble’s already there I help
folks fix it

DETROIT
Shit-fixer Local 123 I try to do
the same with my art Expose the
bullshit

SQUEEZE
Not really the same-

DETROIT
It’s pretty much the same

SQUEEZE
I haven’t seen your stuff-

DETROIT
I’m not gonna show you my stuff

SQUEEZE
But art’s just a complaint People
have complained for centuries

DETROIT
We’re travelling to freedom and
travellers need maps That’s my
art Really good aesthetically
pleasing hopefully expensive
maps But I do other things too

Squeeze does a behind-the back move with the sign He throws
it in the air spins around claps three times catches it

SQUEEZE
So how does this work with you and
Cassius You sound like a radical
and he’s- I don’t know-

DETROIT
He’s real He’s not that fake-ass
bourgie gallery world He’s been
through so much hard shit in life
that he grounds me- and my art

SQUEEZE
Well you’re rubbing him off right

White 51717 40

Detroit looks confused

SQUEEZE (CONT’D)
You know what I mean- he helped
with the work stoppage Your fire
is rubbing off I like it Your
fire I mean I’m going You look
done here Need a ride

DETROIT
Nope Cash is on his way Thanks

Squeeze reaches and wipes something from under Detroit’s eye
It’s faint residue of black grease paint Squeeze and Detroit
look at the grease paint which is now on Squeeze’s thumb
Detroit realizes that her cover is blown

SQUEEZE
Nice work

Squeeze drives off Detroit looks down the street for
Cassius’s car later the sign store’s sign turns off
Detroit sits against the wall looking and checking her
phone

CASSIUS-— OVERDUB BY WHITE ACTOR
Hell yes baby No problem

DETROIT

they sell-

CASSIUS
Do I finally get to see your show

We see that this is a gallery with
are 20 colorful 20-foot sculptures
metal and found objects Some are mounted some are
unfinished on the floor There are slogans and items with
references to music literature and political movements
intertwined in the sculpture There are also life-sized
statues of people standing on the floor looking at the
Africas as if they were art connoiseurs Cassius and Detroit
walk and look at the pieces Detroit lights up a joint

30-foot ceilings There
of Africa made with wood

CASSIUS (CONTD)
Wow They’re beautiful And big

DETROIT
Africa

CASSIUS
Oh Really Is that what that is
White 51717 42

DETROIT
I mean they’re big because they’re
Africa Then I just added my
statues from last year

CASSIUS
Well if nobody comes it’1ll look
full Can I ask a question

DETROIT
You just did-

CASSIUS
Why did you choose Africa for this

As Detroit answers she accents her statements with grand
hand gestures between tokes on the joint Cassius mistakes
these gestures as Detroit passing the joint to him He tries
to grab it each time missing until he finally gives up

DETROIT
That’s where humanity started I
wanted to talk about life shaped by
exploitation and fighting for a say
in our own lives

Cassius zones out and is focusing on the joint in Detroit’s
hand He nods He can see her lips moving but isn’t hearing
her Her audio fades in and out as Cassius’s attention does

DETROIT (CONTD)
--how beauty love and laughter is
able to thrive and flourish under
almost any circumstances

Cassius is still looking at the joint and not hearing her

DETROIT (CONT’D)
--how Capitalism started by
stealing labor from Africans and
how you’re nodding as if you’re
listening but you’re not

Cassius nods pretending to listen
CASSIUS
Mmmhmm Oh Oh No No I was
taking it all in I’m just tired
It’s hard to focus Bear with me

DETROIT
Ok

Cassius takes a hit of the joint

White 51717 43

CASSIUS
I’m listening now Tell me about
it So um capitalism

DETROIT
I’m done talking right now I want
to marinate in this It’s major for
me What I want now is for us to
sit down hit the weed and just be
here

Cassius and Detroit sit down on a futon in the middle of the
gallery Detroit lays her head on Cassius’s chest With one
hand around Detroit Cassius puffs the joint

CASSIUS
Baby the statues are fuckin’ with
me Statues freak me out Like they
might come to life

DETROIT
Mmmhmm Shhhh

EXT SIDE OF OFFICE BUILDING-— MORNING 52

A colorful sign on a wall reads “Regalview Team Members
Remember that the team comes first Don’t let outsiders
interfere with the team”

The sign is snatched down by an unknown hand as we pull out
to reveal about 15 callers gathered in a circle with Squeeze
and Salvador addressing them Cassius is walking toward the
circle in a silver zoot suit carrying a briefcase He
notices them and starts to cross the street to go around but
is spotted by Salvador

to Cassius’s face Cassius already has his chest puffed up
They both have scowls on their faces The crowd quickly
gathers around them

Cassius and Salvador stay in their stances tempers flaring
White 51717 45

Cassius backs up turns around and walks away into the office
building

INT FANCY ELEVATOR- MORNING 53

Cassius walks into the elevator and takes a piece of paper
out of his pocket There is a long passcode scribbled on it
He reads from it and punches in a 30-digit code

ELEVATOR VOICE

need you sharp and ready to go I
detect the pheromones percolating
out of your pores They say to
others around you “I have shown up
to work to kick some ass Hold my
penis while I piss on your
underestimated expectations” Mr

had hands to caress your muscular
brain Today is your day

The elevator door starts to open but malfunctions and closes

INT CASSIUS’S STUDIO APARTMENT-— NIGHT 65

CASSIUS and DETROIT fall onto the bed making out
passionately The furniture around them changes one item at
a time to more visibly more expensive versions of each item
First the TV then chairs then end tables then the bed on
which they continue to make out- which gets too big for the
room

INT CASSIUS’S CHIC APARTMENT- MORNING 66

Finally it is clear that they are actually in a large chic
apartment in a different building altogether

It’s morning CASSIUS and DETROIT are sleeping in bed in a
position similar to the scene before when they were making
out Cassius wakes sits up in bed and stares out the window
at a beautiful view of the city He grabs the remote sits
up and turns on the television As he does this he
inadvertently pulls most of the covers off sleeping Detroit

On the screen is the WorryFree aesthetically luxurious prison
cell that we saw earlier There is an oversized gaudy
chandelier hanging in the middle The decor is Victorian era
with the six bunks seemingly made up with velvet and silk
blankets and built with brass There is fancy wallpaper It’s
so gaudy that it almost looks like The Old Spaghetti Factory

Words flash on the screen “MTV Cribs WorryFree Edition”

MTV ANNOUNCER
Up next on MTV Cribs WorryFree
Edition Hole Puncher Ben Ellman

The show does a typical MTV-style cut to a shot of Benjamin-
45 year-old White guy- pointing to his bunk with his wife
under the covers There are other couples in the other bunks
His wife is giving the camera a fake smile

man in lederhosen It’s “I Got The S Kicked Outta Me”

GAME SHOW AUDIENCE
I got the beep kicked outta me

Cassius changes the channel It’s the local news The news
cameras show a militant strike with chanting picket signs
tussles with the police and scabs being hit on the head-
walking away holding their bleeding heads The strike is in
front of Regalview There are hundreds maybe thousands that
seem to be part of the strike The action is narrated

TV NEWS REPORTER (VO)
Chuck this was the scene yesterday
at the Regalview telemarketers
strike

Chyron on the TV screen reads “Telemarketers Strike Day 40”
We see about 30 cops with riot gear and shields crouched
down shielding themselves in the middle of an intersection
They are being pelted by a hailstorm of soda cans and rocks
from the crowd of thousands around them The scene looks very
much like footage from student protests in Korea

TV NEWS REPORTER (VO)
The striking Regalview workers are
joined by other telemarketers
phone operators and university
students from all over the area

We see SQUEEZE making a speech to the crowd He is holding
and talking into a bullhorn while talking into a microphone
that a reporter is holding

SQUEEZE
We are Telemarketers We are used
to being hung up on Blocked And
ignored But we won’t let Regalview
block ignore or hang up on us

Cassius changes the channel back to MTV Cribs WorryFree
Edition They are in an expansive dining hall of the
WorryFree complex There are tables that seem to stretch as
long as three city blocks Benjamin Ellman walks into frame

White 51717 53

TV NEWS REPORTER (VO)
Although strikers have kept most
replacement workers from breaking
the strike- every morning
Blackwater security agents
successfully escort Regalview’s
elite Power Callers into the
building

A group of ten uniformed men in full riot-gear masks and
shields rush full-speed from the sidewalk across the street
toward the strikers They’re the size of NFL linebackers

They make a protective perimeter around people who are much
smaller in size and very fashionably dressed- who are also
rushing full-speed moving as one unit with the Blackwater
agents In that group CASSIUS FANCY SUIT GUY FANCY SUIT
GUYS ASSISTANT and others We recognize CASSIUS due to his
very bright colored suit In one fluid violent motion we

bloody enraged strikers

Cassius turns over in bed away from Detroit

CASSIUS
C’mon can we not-—

DETROIT
Look I quit when the strike jumped
off because being with you made it
awkward But you abandoned your
friends-

stoppages and Regalview would cave

DETROIT
It’s one thing to take the
promotion but now you’re a full
out scab-

CASSIUS
Power Callers ain’t on strike

Detroit pulls the covers more toward herself

DETROIT

CASSIUS

Oh but you was riding fine when-
DETROIT

DETROIT
Gimme the damn covers

Detroit stands up to leave attempting to take the covers
with her Cassius grabs and pulls the covers Detroit lets
go Cassius falls back onto the floor

CASSIUS
D One of the reasons I took this
job in the first place was to make
myself interesting enough to keep

DETROIT
The old you was way more
interesting If you go to work
today at Regalview- crossing the
picket line- we’re done

EXT OFFICE BUILDING- MORNING 67

Blackwater agents The corners of the frame behind Cassius’s
face are filled with yellow and violet smoke from the smoke
grenades that the Blackwater agents have set off

shitNigga shit Nigga Nigga
Nigga shitNigga shit Nigga
Nigga Nigga shit

The crowd reacts wildly and chants along with him loudly
including STEVE LIFT and FANCY SUIT GUY The crowd dances
with each other with some freaking and doing booty dances
Some are on couches chairs and tables This seems to go on
for a while We see from Cassius’s facial expression that he
is troubled with what he is doing

INT STEVE LIFT’S MANSION- NIGHT 79

CASSIUS sits on a chair alone drinking bourbon distraught
by his performance The party happening through the door on
his left is in slow-motion while Cassius is normal speed We
only hear the sound of Cassius’s breathing and drinking His
formerly white bandage is partly brownish-red with blood
He’s still bleeding He wipes his forehead with a
handkerchief as he looks to his right The exit door

We pull back to see that he is at the end of a long hallway
We pull back past party-goers- some having sex on couches
that line the hallway some passed out sitting against the
walls

We see the back of FANCY SUIT GUY walking down the hallway
toward CASSIUS We follow him back to CASSIUS

White 51717 68

As we follow we hear only CASSIUS breathing and drinking
FANCY SUIT GUY’s footsteps and the sound of a couch banging
the wall from someone having sex

FANCY SUIT GUY kneels down beside CASSIUS FANCY SUIT GUY’s
nose has white powder all over it

FANCY SUIT GUY
Yo Steve wants you back there

FANCY SUIT GUY is not speaking with his White Voice He
motions toward a closed door at the back of the party room

We now hear the music but the surroundings- other than
Cassius and FANCY SUIT GUY- are still in slow motion

FANCY SUIT GUY (CONT’D)
Go through that door all the way
down the hall Make a right then a
left then go through the third
door on your left make a right and
youll see it It’s the magenta
door

Cassius gets up As he does the surroundings go back to
normal speed and the music is at full blast

FANCY SUIT GUY (CONT’D)
Ay We don’t cry about what should
be we thrive on what is This
could be big Don’t fuck it up

As Cassius walks away we see that a small group of people
are watching a YouTube video of Cassius being hit by the Coke
can on a gigantic flatscreen They are laughing hysterically

INT MANSION HALLWAY- NIGHT 80

CASSIUS opens the first door and goes through it He goes
down the dark yet lavishly decorated hallway After he turns
the first time he is in a different kind of hallway It’s
white It almost looks like a hospital When he turns the
second time there are windows that reveal small laboratories
with the lights turned off for the night One of the rooms
that he sees through its window is full of levers ropes
pulleys and metal wheels He finally gets to the door which
is painted magenta and goes through it

INT LIFT’S PRIVATE OFFICELOUNGE- NIGHT 81

CASSIUS enters a spacious and luxurious room that has a desk
as the centerpiece and a giant video screen behind it
White 51717 69

The room is decorated with an equine motif There are
paintings- some small some oversized- with horses and
centaurs One of the pieces is quite sexual involving a
woman and a horse The desk itself is a ridiculously gaudy
thing that involves two sculptured horses side-by-side
holding up a table There is a small dish with apples on the
desk over to one side STEVE LIFT is behind the desk
leaning back in his chair He seems coked out and has a small
mirror in front of him with cocaine residue and a straw
laying on it He throws an apple to CASSIUS who catches it

STEVE LIFT
Heads up

CASSIUS
This room is nuts

STEVE LIFT
Thank you Ill accept that back-
handed compliment Pull up a chair
Cassius Green

Cassius sits

STEVE LIFT (CONT’D)
Is your head okay

CASSIUS
Perfect

STEVE LIFT
Well here in Lift’s lair we’1ll do
no line before it’s time And it’s
time my friend You’re rollin’
with the big dogs

STEVE LIFT pushes a commemorative plate from “The Mr Ed
Show” across the table toward CASSIUS It has a line of
cocaine which circles around into a spiral shape CASSIUS
pauses for a second then snorts the spiral line

CASSIUS
Shit

STEVE LIFT
I wanna propose something Cash

CASSIUS
And I wanna listen to your
proposal Stevie

STEVE LIFT
We need you at WorryFree I see
something in you

(MORE )

White 51717

STEVE LIFT (CONTD)
You’re more than just the best
telemarketer the world has seen
since Hal Jameson

CASSIUS
That’s interesting Yet boring
Tell me something I don’t know
Something with zeros and commas

STEVE LIFT
Cocky I like that You’1ll
understand the proposal if you
watch this video we put together

CASSIUS
Can I take a piss first

STEVE LIFT
No

STEVE LIFT picks up a remote control and starts the video
It’s a commercial video showing still pictures of pastoral
green settings Corny electronic music plays as these still

pictures flash on screen Cassius is uncomfortable and
obviously has to pee A WorryFree logo appears

CASSIUS
I actually hella have to piss

The video pauses
STEVE LIFT

Fine Right out the door It’s the
jade colored door Hurry back

INT MANSION HALLWAY- NIGHT

Cassius rushes out the door into the hallway He goes to the

right and finds the jade door and rushes in

INT WASHROOM-— NIGHT

The room is a darkly-lit yet sanitary looking room with

bathroom tiles on the wall a sink a mirror some curtains
for what seems like showers and one metallic stall We can
see that there’s a guy in the stall because we see his head

CASSIUS
Fuck Only one stall Are you on
your way out or in
White 51717 71

GUY IN STALL
Can you help me

Cassius walks toward the stall The man’s breathing is
audibly heavy

CASSIUS
Naw man Is this some- I’m not-

GUY IN STALL
Please help me I’m fucked up I’m
hurting

GUY IN STALL leans suddenly against the door and bumps it as
if ready to fall

CASSIUS
Aight Hold on m-

Cassius opens the stall door and GUY IN STALL falls out onto
the floor revealing that he’s a naked part-man part-horse

There is no hair on his entire man-horse body save for the
normal patches of hair that a hairy man might have Unlike a
mythical centaur there are no extra limbs His hind legs
have human feet his front legs have human hands He is very
sweaty and has humongous horse-like nostrils

His human eyes show that he is terrified
He is chained and collared to the stall
He let’s out a chilling whinny

Cassius is suddenly terrified and screams out while backing
up

CASSIUS (CONTD)
Fuck Shit Fuck fuck fuck fuck
fuck What the fuck What the fuck

GUY IN STALL
Please help me I’m hurting

He let’s out a whinny

CASSIUS turns to run out but the floor is slippery and he
runs into the shower curtain bumping something behind it
This is not actually a shower but another stall Another man-
horse sticks his head out from behind the curtain He
whinnies

SECOND GUY IN STALL
Please help me I’m hurting

White 51717 72

Other heads of men and women stick their heads out of
curtains whinnying neighing and saying “Please help us”

INT MANSION HALLWAY- NIGHT 84

Cassius bolts out of the door straight into STEVE LIFT who
blocks his exit

CASSIUS
The fuck

STEVE LIFT
Asshole I said the jade door

CASSIUS
That is the jade door

STEVE LIFT
That door is obviously olive Not
jade It is very clearly an olive
colored door

CASSIUS
Get me the fuck outta here

STEVE LIFT forcefully puts both hands on CASSIUS’s shoulders

STEVE LIFT
Ok Big big misunderstanding
Let’s both calm Breathe Let’s go
back to my office I’ll explain Do
you still have to go pee

CASSIUS
I pissed in my fucking pants man
So no I don’t have to pee
anymore I am so fucking outta
here

CASSIUS shakes his shoulder free of STEVE LIFT and tries to
run away STEVE LIFT pulls a silver 9mm pistol from the small
of his back

STEVE LIFT
Ok Breathe Calm Big
misunderstanding Let me explain

INT LIFT’S PRIVATE LOUNGE- NIGHT 85

CASSIUS sits in his chair while STEVE LIFT leans back on the
desk facing CASSIUS
White 51717 73

We see that the pistol is on the desk next to STEVE LIFT
who’s hand is on it Cassius is sweating nervous and
scared

STEVE LIFT
Dude I can’t let you go without
explaining If you had seen the
video before you saw that in there
you wouldn’t have gotten scared

CASSIUS
And just what in the fuck was “that
in there”

STEVE LIFT
The video will explain

STEVE LIFT clicks the remote
The video plays from where it was paused

The screen shows the WorryFree logo which quickly fades out
The screen then reads “The New Miracle” Underneath
“Directed by Michel Gondry” fades in

STEVE LIFT (CONTD)
(0S)
We paid a pretty penny for this
shit

All the words fade out

The stills are now moving and we realize that we are watching
stop-motion animation a lush green countryside with hills
and streams

A group of six Neanderthal-like apes are trying to break open
a coconut They are banging it on the dirt and pounding it
with their hands One of the Neanderthals a female turns
and walks toward the camera naked and very hairy- with hairy
breasts and nipples visible She speaks with a British
accent

NEANDERTHAL WOMAN
Since the dawn of time- or at least
since before anyone cares to
remember- we have used our wits to
survive

A smaller Neanderthal snatches the coconut from a bigger
Neanderthal and smashes it against a rock cracking it open
and exposing its beautiful treasure The Neanderthals cheer
with ape-like sounds of excitement
White 51717 74

NEANDERTHAL WOMAN (CONT’D)
But what allowed us to thrive was
our use of tools A natural
development

The bigger Neanderthal lets out a shrill furious scream and
smashes the back of the smaller Neanderthal’s head with a
big pointed rock The smaller Neanderthal falls over dead
The others look on in horror The animation rewinds and
freeze frames on the arm of bigger Neanderthal’s arm smashing
the rock into the smaller one’s head Blood and pieces of
skull are spurting out frozen in mid-air

NEANDERTHAL WOMAN (CONT’D)
But what are tools-

A red dotted line is superimposed over the bigger
Neanderthal’s arm from the shoulder to the tip of his
fingers A caption reads “Arm”

NEANDERTHAL WOMAN (CONT’D)
-if not extensions of the
appendages with which we were born

A yellow dotted line is superimposed over the rock from the
tip of the bigger Neanderthal’s fingers to the end of the
rock which is partly in the smaller one’s head A caption
reads “Rock” The yellow dotted line turns red and the
caption reading “Rock” disappears The “Arm” caption moves
center screen

The arm turns into a Homo sapiens arm and the rock turns into
a hammer The arm and hammer hammers a nail

The hammer turns into a TV remote control The hand clicks
the remote

NEANDERTHAL WOMAN (0S) (CONTD)
Humans sometime need modification
to perform better in a specified
situation We have done so
throughout history

We see boxers sparring in a boxing ring as Neanderthal Woman
walks through the frame

NEANDERTHAL WOMAN (CONT’D)
We train ourselves to fight

Neanderthal Woman walks into a weight room

NEANDERTHAL WOMAN (CONT’D)
We work out
White 51717 75

Neanderthal Woman walks into a dorm room where someone is
studying at a desk

NEANDERTHAL WOMAN (CONT’D)
We study These changes to the body
and mind are actually chemical
changes

The dorm room fades away and the WorryFree logo appears
behind Neanderthal Woman

NEANDERTHAL WOMAN (CONT’D)
WorryFree is continuing that
natural development that started in
pre-historic times We are proud to
announce to our share holders a new
day in human productivity

A scientific laboratory appears behind Neanderthal Woman
with scientists working

NEANDERTHAL WOMAN (CONT’D)
Our scientists have discovered a
way- a chemical change- to make
humans stronger more obedient
more durable and therefore more
efficient and profitable

A factory assembly line appears behind Neanderthal Woman
with a workers pulling levers on machines lifting widgets
from a conveyor belt etc

NEANDERTHAL WOMAN (CONT’D)
At WorryFree we realize that human
labor is more efficient than robot
labor when it comes to adaptability
of movement for various duties
But human labor has its
limitations

The workers transform into big hulking horse-people They
are lifting more widgets pulling bigger levers on bigger
machines producing more widgets They are all happy

NEANDERTHAL WOMAN (CONT’D)
We are breaking the limitations
Our workforce of Equisapiens will
make WorryFree the most profitable
company in human history And you
our shareholders will take that
place in history with us

Steve Lift stops the video
White 51717 76

STEVE LIFT
See what I’m talkin about Big
misunderstanding

CASSIUS
Uhn-uhn No What do you mean
There is no fucking
misunderstanding Are those half-
horse half-people that you have
created in a lab to make more
money

STEVE LIFT
Well yeah I just didn’t want you
to think I was crazy or something
Because I’m doing this for a
reason So I’m not irrational

CASSIUS
Aight Cool I understand and I
would like to leave now Please

STEVE LIFT
But I didn’t even get to make my
proposal to you

Cassius starts to get up

CASSIUS
Can you call me tomorrow about
that I need to leave now but I’m
very interested

Steve Lift puts his hand on the gun Cassius sits

STEVE LIFT
You have to see the rest of the
video There’s a lot of production
value Then my proposal

Steve Lift clicks the remote and plays the video

The animated video shows workers of a factory lining up in
several lines to go through doors

NEANDERTHAL WOMAN
Our worker modification process is
simple and rather quick It works
for 70 percent of humans who take
the fusing catalyst

The workers walk through the doors and are handed silver
straws by men and women in labcoats
White 51717 77

Nurses approach the workers with plates full of powder which
the workers snort through the silver straw The workers go to
waiting rooms much like the “washroom” that Cassius entered
They transform almost magically into horse-people

STEVE LIFT
This is how we-

Steve Lift’s voice is drowned out as Cassius flashes back to
his snorting the spiral line of powder on the Mr Ed plate
then flashing to the horse-man who fell over in the washroom
then looking at the animated workers snorting powder and
turning into horse-people The images flash over and over
faster and faster Cassius hyperventilates His eyes tear up

CASSIUS
Wait Hold up Wait Wait What the
fuck did you have me snort

Cassius jumps up Steve Lift grabs the gun

CASSIUS (CONT’D)
Answer me man I’m not even high

STEVE LIFT
You’re not What-

Cassius is in tears

CASSIUS
(pointing to the gun) Muthafucka-
that shit don’t scare me If you
gave me some mutation shit I want
you to shoot me

STEVE LIFT
Cash What you snorted was 100
Peruvian

CASSIUS

Cocaine It was coke

STEVE LIFT
You heard what I said

CASSIUS
You said “100 Peruvian” Be
precise They got horses in Peru
probably

STEVE LIFT
Dude You’re gettin’ all semantic
on me
White 51717 78

CASSIUS
No I’m just trying to be clear If
you were actually meaning horses
when you said “100 Peruvian” it
would be you who’s being semantic
because- Fuck this shit Was it
coke or not

STEVE LIFT

It was cocaine man I’m not evil
This ain’t a movie This is real
life I wouldn’t just slip you the
fusing catalyst You don’t feel
high because your adrenaline is
pumpin’ so hard You’re harshin’
your buzz

Steve Lift calms Cassius by motioning him to breathe deeply
with him pseudo-yoga style Cassius sits back down

STEVE LIFT (CONTD)
Ok

CASSIUS
Ok

STEVE LIFT
The proposal I was going to make
was this This new caliber of
worker They are bigger stronger
and hopefully they don’t gripe as
much Soon there will be millions
of them

CASSIUS
This is crazy

STEVE LIFT
They’11l develop they’re own
identity and customs They may wish
to rebel organize We need someone
to represent WorryFree’s interests
Someone they can relate to

CASSIUS
A manager- that’s a man-horse

STEVE LIFT
No An Equisapiens Martin Luther
King One that we control One that
we create

White 51717 79

CASSIUS
You want to create a false leader
of the horse-people- who actually
works for you

STEVE LIFT
Basically Keeps shit simple
CASSIUS
But me Why would you single me
out
STEVE LIFT

Cassius you’re amazing You rose
so quickly at Regalview I need a
man like you Hungry Not afraid to
shank your friends if they get in
the way You’re freaked out Ready
to say no Go home Think about it
After looking at what I’m offering
you

Steve hands Cassius a piece of paper that reads “I’m offering
you 100000000”

CASSIUS
No amount is gonna make me wanna do
that Are you crazy

STEVE LIFT
2 things One It would be only a 5
year contract After 5 years we
give you the Diffuser Antidote
Special Sauce Serum and you’re back
to normal Two Don’t forget you’d
have a horse-dick

CASSIUS
Special Sauce Serum You’re making
that up It’s not real

STEVE LIFT
Oh it’s real So’s the offer 5
years as our man among horses 100
Million Dollars Go home Think
about it Holla at me later

INT CASSIUS’S CHIC APARTMENT- MORNING 87

Morning Cassius is sleeping in his clothes from the night
before He tosses and turns putting the pillow over his head
to block the light There is blood on the pillows

He has a flashback of Lift’s Private Office We see the
mirror on the desk in front of Steve Lift with the cocaine
residue and straw Then we see the Mr Ed plate being pushed
toward Cassius A revelation that Cassius may have snorted
something different than what Steve Lift was snorting

Cassius sits up He picks up the newspaper that’s sitting on
his night stand A column on the front page reads People
Should Worry About WorryFree It’s an article about the
unethical conduct of WorryFree The byline Eric Arnold

Cassius picks up the phone and dials

VOICE ON PHONE

The YouTube video shows an attractive woman striker holding a
Coca-Cola can up to the camera and shaking it vigorously
while smiling sweetly She the throws it with perfect form
past the Blackwater guards hitting Cassius on the forehead
When the can hits a “Boing” sound effect happens

CASSIUS
Fuck

CAN THROWER

The video shows the woman smiling and taking a theatrical bow
while fellow strikers clap

Roaring laughter from the studio audience The host is
laughing uncontrollably

Cassius turns off the TV and realizes that he has been
sketching a horse on the newspaper while watching

He jumps up pats his pockets and rifles through them

CASSIUS

INT MEDICAL WAITING ROOM- DAY 89

Cassius sits in a waiting room reading a National Enquirer
The cover has a crudely photo-shopped picture of a person
with a head that has been cut and pasted from a photo of a
horse It does not look real at all The headline reads
Horse-People Stealing Jobs From Slaves

The TV is blaring an episode from Entertainment Tonight
Cassius looks up at it

The doctor shakes his head “No” Cassius pulls his pants up

EXT CITY STREET- DAY 91

Cassius rushes down the street dialing on his phone He puts
it to his ear

CASSIUS
Detroit It’s me I lost my phone
last night and got a new one I
need to see you immediately
Please It’s important

INT CASSIUS’S CHIC APARTMENT- NIGHT 92

Cassius is standing in front of Detroit facing her He
starts unbuttoning his pants

DETROIT
No Cassius

CASSIUS
Not like that Really Tell me if
it looks different

Cassius pulls his pants down Detroit looks
White 51717 84

DETROIT
Looks the same to me What am I
looking for Herpes or crabs or
something Did you go fuck some
girl raw

CASSIUS
No It doesn’t look bigger ‘Cause
it feels bigger

DETROIT
Glad you’re feelin’ yourself Is
that why you kept trying to booty
call me last night

CASSIUS
I didn’t booty call you I told you
I lost my phone I lost it at the
party I just got a new one today

Detroit looks at her phone

DETROIT
I got a call from you at 323am
And a video message that I didn’t
check yet

CASSIUS

Can I see that
Detroit hands the phone to Cassius
He presses a button to play the video as they both watch

It’s a video message from one of the horse-people who is
apparently operating the phone while it’s on the floor There
are other horse people who are shoving they’re head in and
out of frame

GUY IN STALL
Help me Please I’m hurting

The horse-people start whinnying and getting very excited

OTHER HORSE-PEOPLE
I’m hurting Help me I’m hurting
Please

The horse-people get so excited that they kick the phone
around- it shows the various body parts and there is a
WorryFree logo on the wall Then we see workers in WorryFree
uniforms come in and inject the equisapiens with some kind of
sedative
White 51717 85

A WorryFree manager punches a code into a wall-mounted dial
pad which loosens the chains of the now sedated Equisapiens
The chains slack and workers herd the Equisapiens back into
the stalls The manager punches in another code and the
chains tighten once more STEVE LIFT walks in wearing a
ridiculously colored bathrobe

STEVE LIFT
Quiet down you motherfucking
freaks-of-nature This is me time
and you’re-

The video cuts off

CASSIUS
I guess I found my phone

EXT STREET 93
Cassius and Detroit are walking fast Detroit’s freaking out

DETROIT
What the fuck

CASSIUS
That’s what I said

DETROIT
Oh my god Oh shit This doesn’t
seem real We can’t let them do
this People have to know You have
to tell them
(points at his crotch)
But why did-

CASSIUS
I thought I was turning into an
Equisapien I thought I snorted the
activator but I guess it was just
coke after all

DETROIT
But why focus on your dick They
have huge nostrils You could’ve
asked me to check your nostrils

CASSIUS
Ok Are my nostrils bigger

Detroit checks Cassius is unconsciously flaring his
nostrils

White 51717

DETROIT
Yes Because you keep flaring them

Cassius is actually flaring his nostrils because he is
breaking down from the stress and starting to cry As he
cries Detroit moves closer to console him

INT CASSIUS’S CHIC APARTMENT- NIGHT
Cassius and Detroit are laying on the floor after having

DETROIT
I just want you to know- I need to
be clear- this can’t happen again
We’re not back together Ok

CASSIUS
Ok I need you to know- I’m not
going back I can’t be a Power
Caller anymore I can’t work for
WorryFree And I need you D

DETROIT
I think that’s a great decision
But I still have problems with all
this

CASSIUS
But now I’m-

DETROIT
You happily sold slaves and scabbed
against the strike Only something
happening to you turned you against
them

CASSIUS
Isn’t that how we all make
decisions And I didn’t-

DETROIT
No It doesn’t have to be

CASSIUS
Look- I see myself in their eyes
WorryFree and Regalview They see a
pawn a creature to manipulate I’m
not that dude anymore

DETROIT
Good But that doesn’t change what
I said about us Also I kind of
messed with somebody last night

sex

White 51717 87

CASSIUS
What does “kind of messed with”
mean Did you-

DETROIT
Everything but

CASSIUS
“Everything but” That can be way
nastier than- What exactly- did you-

Detroit nods

CASSIUS (CONTD)
Did he-

Detroit smiles and nods

CASSIUS (CONTD)
(strange hand gyration)
Did you both-

DETROIT
Cassius we’re broken up Over
It’s you and me that shouldn’t have
messed around tonight Don’t you
want to know who it was

CASSIUS
Are you planning on fucking or
everything-but-ing him again

DETROIT
No

CASSIUS
Then I don’t want to know I mean
I think I know Was it- no I don’t
wanna know

Cassius reaches over and turns out the light

INT DREAMWORLD- NIGHT 95

Cassius is dreaming We see a rapid-fire montage of Cassius’s
high REM eyelids and macabre VHS-like youtube clips Cassius
with the bottoms of multiple coke cans covering his face
horses running having sex eating pulling carriages At the
pulling carriage part all of a sudden he is harnessed in the
elevator and Diana Debauchery is holding the reigns

INT CASSIUS’S CHIC APARTMENT- NIGHT 96

Cassius wakes breathing heavily He looks Detroit is gone

EXT STREET- NIGHT 97

It’s nighttime in a business district Detroit and 8 other
people mainly women are running full-bore down the street-—
laughing and whooping They are all wearing black and they
each have one black grease-paint stripe under their left eye
Many are carrying bags They run to a parked van whose driver
is waiting for them The van doors fly open and the group
starts filing in Detroit pauses before she jumps in looking
back proudly at what they’ve accomplished

Detroit jumps into the van which pulls away

EXT STREET- MORNING 98

Morning Detroit is walking the opposite direction in the
area she was running the night before She has a huge smile
on her face A crowd is gathering and looking at something
Some people are taking pictures Many look bewildered

They’re looking at a 20-ft high by 50-ft long painted papier
maché sculpture of Steve Lift in a suit with his pants down
mating with a horse from behind There are 3-ft high three-
dimensional letters in front of the sculpture reading
“WorryFree Is Turning Workers Into Horses And Fucking Them”

Detroit listens to onlookers

MAN IN CROWD

(to wife)
I have absolutely no idea what this
is about

The wife laughs

OTHER MAN IN CROWD
Maybe it’s saying that capitalism
dehumanizes and that-

DETROIT
Maybe the artist is being literal
Maybe WorryFree is turning workers
into horses Literally

White 51717 89

OTHER MAN IN CROWD
And literally fucking them

Detroit doesn’t answer but gazes at her work satisfied Her
right earring reads “Tell Homeland Security” and her left
earring reads “We Are The Bomb” in big block letters

EXT TACO TRUCK- DAY 99
Cassius looks over the taco truck menu

A Car Aficionado is showing off a customized car to a friend

Close-up on a video monitor The monitor is playing a
commercial with high production value

A jingle plays as we see a beautifully made up Cynthia Rose
in very fashionable faux-anarchist attire

She is smiling into the camera with her hair blowing wildly
in slow motion while a very fake demonstration is happening
in the background

Cynthia reaches into her backpack and pulls out a Coca-Cola
can which seems to glow

Still smiling into the camera she winks and throws the can
at the head of an actor that looks very similar to Cassius

When it hits his head- demonstrators fellow suits Cynthia
Rose and Blackwater security start singing “Have a Coke and
a smile bitch” in a Broadway musical style while dancing

The wounded Fake Cassius- who has been knocked on the ground-
gets up sips the Coke enthusiastically and makes out wildly
with Cynthia Rose

As the commercial ends we pull back and see the commercial
on a producer’s monitor behind a camera on a soundstage

A PRODUCER uses hand signals that say “3 2 1- Go”
