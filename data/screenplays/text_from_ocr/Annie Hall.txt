Abrupt medium close-up of Alvy Singer doing a comedy monologue He

wearing a crumbled sports jacket and tieless shirt

ALVY
Theres an old joke Uh two
women are at a Catskills moun
resort and one of ‘em says
food at this place is really
The other one says Yeah I
such small portions Wel
essentially how I feel about
of loneliness and misery and
and unhappiness and its all
too quickly
joke for me is one thats uh
attributed to Groucho Marx

The-the other important

but I think

the background is stark

elderly
tain
Boy the
terrible
know and
1 thats
life Full
suffering
over much

usually

it appears originally in Freuds wit and

its relation to the unconscious
goes like this-Im paraphrasing Uh
I would never wanna belong to any club

And it

that would have someone like me for a
member Thats the key joke of my adult

life in terms of my relations
women Tsch you know latel
strangest things have been go
through my mind
tsch and I guess Im going t
life crisis or something I d
I uh and Im not worried
Im not one o
Although Im balding slightly
about the worst you can say a

those characters

ips with
y the
ing

cause I turned forty

rough a

ont know
about aging
you know
on top thats
bout me I

uh I think Im gonna get better as I get

older you know I think Im
the balding virile type you

gray for instance you know
neither o those two Unless

gonna be the-
now as

uh distinguished

Less Im
Im one o

those guys with saliva dribbling out of
his mouth who wanders into a cafeteria
with a shopping bag screaming about
socialism

(Sighing)
Annie and I broke up and I-I still cant
get my mind around that You know I-I
keep sifting the pieces of the relationship
through my mind and-and examining my life
and tryin to figure out where did the
screw-up come you know and a year ago we
were tsch in love You know and-and-and
And its funny Im not-Im not a
morose type Im not a depressive character
I-I-I uh

(Laughing)
you know I was a reasonably happy kid
I guess I was brought up in Brooklyn
during World War IT

INT DOCTORS OFFICE-DAY

CUT TO

Alvy as young boy sits on a sofa with his mother in an old-fashioned

cluttered doctors office The doctor stands near the sofa
cigarette and listening

MOTHER
(To the doctor)
Hes been depressed All off a sudden
he cant do anything

DOCTOR
(Nodding)
Why are you depressed Alvy

MOTHER
(Nudging Alvy)
Tell Dr Flicker
(Young Alvy sits his head down His
mother answers for him)
Its something he read

DOCTOR
(Puffing on his cigarette and
nodding)
Something he read huh

ALVY
(His head still down)
The universe is expanding

DOCTOR
The universe is expanding

ALVY
(Looking up at the doctor)
Well the universe is everything and if

holding a
its expanding someday it will break apart
and that would be the end of everything

Disgusted his mother looks at him

MOTHER
(shouting)
What is that your business
(she turns back to the doctor)
He stopped doing his homework

ALVY
Whats the point

MOTHER
(Excited gesturing with her hands)
What has the universe got to do with it
Youre here in Brooklyn Brooklyn is not
expanding

DOCTOR
(Heartily looking down at Alvy)
It wont be expanding for billions of years
yet Alvy And weve gotta try to enjoy
ourselves while were here Uh

He laughs

CUT TO

Fall shot of house with an amusement-park roller-coaster ride built over it
A line of cars move up and then slides with great speed while out the window
of the house a band shakes a dust mop

ALVYS VOICE
My analyst says I exaggerate my childhood
memories but I swear I was brought up
underneath the roller-

CUT TO

INT HOUSE

Alvy as a child sits at the table eating soup and reading a comic book while
his father sits on the sofa reading the paper The house shakes with every
move of the roller coaster

ALVYS VOICE
-coaster in the Coney Island section of
Brooklyn Maybe that accounts for my
personality which is a little nervous I
think

CuT TO

Young Alvy at the food-stand concession watching three military men
representing the Army the Navy and the Marines arm in arm with a blond woman
in a skirted bathing suit They all turn and run toward the foreground The
girl stops before the camera to lean over and throw a kiss The sign over
the

concession reads Steves Famous Clam Bar Ice Cold Beer and the roller
coaster is moving in full gear in the background

ALVYS VOICE
You know I have a hyperactive imagination
My mind tends to jump around a little and
have some trouble between fantasy and reality

CUT TO

Full shot of people in bumper cars thoroughly enjoying bumping into each
other
as Alvy father stands in the center of the track directing traffic

ALVYS VOICE
My father ran the bumper-car concession
(Alvy as a child moves into the frame
driving a bumper car He stops as other
cars bombard him His father continues
to direct the traffic)
There-there he is and there I am But I-I-I-I
used to get my aggression out through those
cars all the time

Alvy backs up his car off screen
INT SCHOOLROOM - DAY

The camera pans over three austere-looking teachers standing in front of the
blackboard The chalk writing on the board changes as each teacher lectures
While Alvy speaks one of the male teachers puts an equation on the
blackboard

- 2 X¥ 10 20 and other arithmetic formulas

ALVYS VOICE
I remember the staff at our public
school You know we had a saying uh
that Those who cant do teach and
those who cant teach teach gym And
-uh hh of course those who couldnt
do anything I think were assigned to
our school I must say-

CUT TO

A female teacher standing in front of an old-fashioned schoolroom The
blackboard behind her reads Transportation Administration The camera pans
her point of view a group of young students sitting behind their desks
Alvy

as a child sits in a center desk wile all around him there is student
activity

there is note-passing ruler-tapping nose-picking gumchewing

ALVYS VOICE
I always felt my schoolmates were idiots
Melvyn Greenglass you know fat little
face and Henrietta Farrell just Miss
Perfect all the time And-and Ivan
Ackerman always the wrong answer Always

Ivan stands up behind his desk

IVAN
Seven and three is nine

Alvy hits his forehead with his hand Another student glances over at him
reacting

ALVYS VOICE
Even then I knew they were just jerks
(The camera moves back to the teacher
who is glaring out at her students)
In nineteen forty-two I had already dis-

As Alvy talks the camera shows him move from his seat and kiss a young girl
She jumps from her seat in disgust rubbing her cheek as Alvy moves back to
his seat

1sT GIRL
(Making noises)
Ugh he kissed me he kissed me

TEACHER
(Off screen)

As the teacher really glaring now speaks Alvy rises from his seat and
moves

over to her Angry she points with her band while the students turn their
heads to watch what will happen next

ALVY
Whatd I do

TEACHER
Step up here

ALVY
Whatd I do

TEACHER

You should be ashamed of yourself

The students their heads still turned look back at Alvy now an adult
sitting in the last seat of the second row

ALVY (AS ADULT)
(First off screen then onscreen as
camera moves over to the back of the
classroom)
Why I was just expressing a healthy sexual
curiosity

TEACHER
(The younger Alvy standing next to her)
Six-year-old boys dont have girls on
their minds

ALVY (AS ADULT)
(Still sitting in the back of
the classroom)
I did

The girl the young Alvy kissed turns to the older Alvy she gestures and
speaks

1sT GIRL
For Gods sakes Alvy even Freud speaks
of a latency period

ALVY (AS ADULT)
(Gesturing)
Well I never had a latency period I
cant help it

TEACHER
(With young Alvy still at her side)
Why couldnt you have been more like Donald
(The camera pans over to Donald
sitting up tall in his seat then
back to the teacher)
Now there was a model boy

ALVY (AS CHILD)
(Still standing next to the teacher)
Tell the folks where you are today Donald

DONALD

ALVYS VOICE

INT THEATER LOBBY

A lined-up crowd of ticket holders waiting to get into the theater
Annie among them

ensuing
scene

Alvy reacting to the mans loud monologue

Annie

ANNIE
(Laughing now)
thats a polite word for what you are

MAN IN LINE
(Loudly to his companion right
behind Alvy and Annie)

We saw the Fellini film last Tuesday

It is not one of his best It lacks a
cohesive structure You know you get
the feeling that hes not absolutely sure

what

always felt he was essentially a-a technical

film maker Granted La Strada was a great

film

it is he wants to say ‘Course Ive

Great in its use of negative energy

more than anything else But that simple
cohesive core

begins to read her newspaper

Im-I

Well

ALVY
(Overlapping the mans speech)
m-Im gonna have a stroke

ANNIE
(Reading)
stop listening to him

MAN IN LINE
(Overlapping Alvy and Annie)

You know it must need to have had its
leading from one thought to another
You know what Im talking about

ALVY
(Sighing)

Hes screaming his opinions in my ear

MAN IN LINE

Like all that Juliet of the Spirits or
Satyricon I found it incredibly
indulgent You know he really is Hes
one of the most indulgent film makers He
really is-

starts to get annoyed

Alvy and

A bum of indistinct chatter can be heard through the

while
ALVY
(Overlapping)
Key word here is indulgent

MAN IN LINE
(Overlapping)
-without getting well lets put it
this way

ALVY
(To Annie who is still reading
overlapping the man in line who is
still talking)
What are you depressed about

ANNIE
I missed my therapy I overslept

ALVY
How can you possibly oversleep

ANNIE
The alarm clock

ALVY
(Gasping)

You know what a hostile gesture that is
to me

ANNIE
I know-because of our sexual problem
right

ALVY
Hey you everybody in line at the
New Yorker has to know our rate of
intercourse

MAN IN LINE
- Its like Samuel Beckett you know-
I admire the technique but he doesnt
he doesnt hit me on a gut level

ALVY
(To Annie)
Id like to hit this guy on a gut level

The man in line continues his speech all the while Alvy and Annie

ANNIE
Stop it Alvy

ALVY
(Wringing his hands)
Well hes spitting on my neck You know
hes spitting on my neck when he talks

talk
MAN IN LINE
And then the most important thing of all
is a comedians vision

ANNIE
And you know something else You know
youre so egocentric that if I miss my
therapy you can think of it in terms of
how it affects you

MAN IN LINE
(Lighting a cigarette while he talks
Gal gun-shy is what it is

ALVY
(Reacting again to the man in line)
Probably on their first date right

MAN IN LINE
(Still going on)
Its a narrow view

ALVY
Probably met by answering an ad in the
New York Review of Books Thirtyish

academic wishes to meet woman whos
interested in Mozart James Joyce and
sodomy

(He sighs then to Annie)
Whatta you mean our sexual problem

ANNIE
Oh

ALVY
I-I-I mean Im comparatively normal
for a guy raised in Brooklyn

ANNIE
Okay Im very sorry My sexual problem
Okay my sexual problem Huh

The man in front of them turns to look at them then looks away

ALVY
I never read that That was-that was
Henry James right Novel uh the
sequel to Turn of the Screw My Sexual

MAN IN LINE
(Even louder now)
Its the influence of television Yeah
now Marshall McLuhan deals with it in terms
of it being a-a high uh high intensity
you understand A hot medium as opposed
toa
ALVY
(More and more aggravated)
What I wouldnt give for a large sock o
horse manure

MAN IN LINE
aS opposed to a print

Alvy steps forward waving his hands in frustration and stands facing the
camera

ALVY
(Sighing and addressing the audience)
What do you do when you get stuck in a movie
line with a guy like this behind you I mean
its just maddening

The man in line moves toward Alvy Both address the audience now

MAN IN LINE
Wait a minute why cant I give my opinion
Its a free country

ALVY
I mean d- He can give you- Do you hafta
give it so loud I mean arent you ashamed
to pontificate like that And-and the funny
part of it is M-Marshall McLuhan you dont
know anything about Marshall McLuhanswork

MAN IN LINE
(Overlapping)
Wait a minute Really Really I happen to
teach a class at Columbia called TV Media

and Culture So I think that my insights
into Mr McLuhan-well have a great deal of
validity

ALVY

Oh do yuh

MAN IN LINE

Yes

ALVY
Well thats funny because I happen to
have Mr McLuhan right here So so
here just let me-I mean all right Come
over here a second

Alvy gestures to the camera which follows him and the man in line to the back
of the crowded lobby He moves over to a large stand-up movie poster and
pulls Marshall McLuban from behind the poster

MAN IN LINE
Oh
ALVY
(To McLuban)
Tell him

MCLUHAN
(To the man in line)
I hear-I heard what you were saying
You-you know nothing of my work You
mean my whole fallacy is wrong How you
ever got to teach a course in anything is
totally amazing

Allison clipboard in band walks about the wings stopping to talk to

activity

Allison wears a large ADLAI button as do the people around her The
sounds

of a comedian on the stage of the auditorium can be heard occasionally
interrupted by chatter and applause from the off screen audience Allison
stops to talk to two women they too wear ADLAI buttons

ALLISON
(Looking down at the clipboard)
Maam youre on right after this man

WOMAN
Oh thank you

Alvy moves into the frame behind Allison He taps her on the shoulder she
turns to face him

ALVY

nervously)

ALLISON
(Laughing)

ALVY
(Overlapping)

They move closer to the stage looking out from the wings

ALLISON

minutes then I gotta go out there I

(Off screen)
They-they theyre laughed out

ALLISON
(Off screen)
Do you feel all right

As Allison and Alvy look out at the stage the camera cuts to their point of
view a comedian standing at a podium in front of huge waving pictures of
Adlai

Stevenson The audience laughing and clapping sits at round tables in
clusters around the room

The camera moves back to Allison and Alvy watching the stage Alvy is
swinging
his hands nervously
COMEDIAN
(Off screen onstage)
You know

Alvy starts looking Allison up and down people in the background mill about

ALVY
(Above the chatter around him)
Look whats your-whats your name

COMEDIAN

Allison

ALVY

a group from the

ALVY
(Coughing)
Thank you I-I dont know why they would
have me at this kind of rally cause

Excuse me Im not essentially a political
comedian at all

The audience starts to laugh

ALVY
I interestingly had uh dated
a woman in the Eisenhower Administration
briefly and uh it was ironic to
me ‘cause uh tsch cause I

was trying to u-u-uh do to her what
Eisenhower has been doing to the country
for the last eight years

The audience is with him laughing as Allison continues to watch offstage
INT APARTMENT BEDROOM

Allison and Alvy are on the bed kissing There are books all over the
room

a fireplace unlit along one of the walls Alvy suddenly breaks away and
sits

on the edge of the bed Allison looks at him
ALVY
Hm Im sorry I cant go through with
this because it-I cant get it off my
mind Allison its obsessing me

ALLISON
Well Im getting tired of it I need
your attention

Alvy gets up from the bed and starts walking restlessly around the room
gesturing with his hands

ALVY
It-but it-it doesnt make any sense
He drove past the book depository and the
police said conclusively that it was an
exit wound So-how is it possible for
Oswald to have fired from two angles at
once It doesnt make sense

ALLISON
Alvy

Alvy stopping for a moment at the fireplace mantel sighs He then snaps
his
fingers and starts walking again

ALVY
Ill tell you this He was not marksman
enough to hit a moving target at that
range But
(Clears his throat)
if there was a second assassin it-
Thats it

Alvy stops at the music stand with open sheet music on it as Allison gets up
from the bed and retrieves a pack of cigarettes from a bookshelf

ALLISON

ALVY

ALLISON

(Moving back to the bed and
lighting a cigarette)

attendant

ALLISON

an excuse to avoid sex with me

ALVY

(Then to the camera)
Shes right Why did I turn off Allison
Portchnik She was-she was beautiful She

EXT BEACH HOUSE - DAY

Alvys and Annies voices are heard over the wind-browned exterior of a beach
house in the Hamptons As they continue to talk the camera moves inside the
house Alvy is picking up chairs trying to get at the group of lobsters
crawling on the floor Dishes are stacked up in a drying rack

and bags of

groceries sit on the counter Theres a table and chairs near the

refrigerator

ANNIE
Alvy now dont panic Please

ALVY
Look I told you it was a mistake
to ever bring a live thing in the house

ANNIE

The lobsters continue to crawl on the floor Annie bolding out a wooden

paddle tries to shove them onto it

ALVY
Well maybe we should just call the police

Gods sake

ALVY

possible as Annie covering her mouth

and laughing hysterically teasingly

dangles a lobster in front of him)

takes the lid of a large steamer
filled with boiling water)

gingerly into the pot and puts the cover back on

push it from the wall

Annie rushes out of the room to get her camera as Alvy picks up the paddle
Trying to get at the lobsters he ends up knocking over dishes and hitting
the

chandelier Holding the paddle he finally leans back against the sink

Seven

Dwarfs The Wicked Queen resembling Annie sits in the palace before her
mirror Alvy as a cartoon figure sits beside her arms crossed in front
him

WICKED QUEEN

INT MOVIE THEATER

The screen is projecting the beginning of The Sorrow and the Pity a street
filled with fleeing cars belongings tied on top and piled in the back seats
Subtitles pop on

The Jewish warmongers and

Parisian plutocrats tried

to flee with their gold and jewels

as a narrator explains in German

CUT TO
Split screen Annie and her psychiatrist on the left Alvy and his on the
right Annie talking sits in a white molded chair as does her doctor

The office is very modern stark white and chrome Alvy talking to his
psychiatrist lies on a deep leather sofa the doctor seated away from him
This office looks more like a well-worn den bookcases overflowing dark
wood

The dialogue is separated in each screen though no one talks simultaneously

ANNIE

(To her doctor)
That day in Brooklyn was the last day
I remember really having a great time

ALVY
(To his doctor)

INT JAIL-CELLS CORRIDOR

He walks down the corridor off screen
EXT A STREET IN FRONT OF THE COURT HOUSE - DAY

CUT TO
INT REHEARSAL HALL OF A THEATER

An actor and actress sit on hard wooden chairs in a sparse rehearsal ball
They face each other The actress resembles Annie the actor Alvy

ACTOR
Youre a thinking person How can you
choose this lifestyle

ACTRESS
What is so incredibly great about New
York Its a dying city You-you read
Death in Venice

ACTOR
You didnt read Death in Venice till
I gave it to you

ACTRESS
Well you only give me books with the
word death in the title

The camera pulls back showing Alvy sitting with two men at a table set up
near the actors A mirror running the whole width of the wall reflects the
two actors a script lying on the table between them It is obvious now that
they are rehearsing a scene that Alvy wrote

ACTOR
(In mirrored reflection)
Its an important issue

ACTRESS
(In mirrored reflection)
Alvy you are totally incapable of
enjoying life

The camera moves back to actual actor and actress

ACTRESS
Youre like New York Youre an island

ACTOR
(Rising with emotion)
Okay if thats all that weve been
through together means to you I guess
its better if we just said goodbye
once and for all You know its funny
after all the serious talks and passionate
moments that it ends here in a health
-food restaurant on Sunset Boulevard
Goodbye Sunny

The actor begins to leave as the actress jumps up from her chair

ACTRESS
Wait Im-Im gonna go with you
(The actor comes back They embrace)
I love you

The camera cuts to Alvy who turns and looks straight into the camera

ALVY

(To the audience gesturing)
Tsch whatta you want It was my first
play You know you know how youre
always tryin t get things to come out
perfect in art because uh its real
difficult in life Interestingly however
I did run into Annie again It was on the
Upper West Side of Manhattan

Annie singing Seems Like Old Times overlaps Alvys speech and continues
over the next scene where Alvy standing in front of a Manhattan theater
shakes hands with Annie and her escort The theater marquee reads OPHULS
PRIZE FILM THE SORROW AND THE PITY

ALVYS VOICE
(Over the theater scene and
Annies singing)
She had moved back to New York She was
living in SoHo with some guy
(Laughing)
And when I met her she was of all things
dragging him in to see The Sorrow and the
Pity Which I counted as a personal
triumph Annie andI
(Alvys voice continues over the
scene shot through a window of
Manhattan cafe showing Alvy and
Annie sitting at a table laughing
and enjoying themselves)
we had lunch sometime after that and
uh just uh kicked around old times

A series of flashbacks following in quick succession while Annie continues to
sing

Annie and Alvy going up the FDR Drive the day they met playing tennis Annie
driving Alvy bolding up partially eaten sandwich

Annie and Alvy in the Hamptons house kitchen Annie banding a live lobster to
Alvy who drops it in the pot on the stove
Annie and Alvy walking side by side by the shoreline

Alvy at the tennis club packing his bag as he looks over his shoulder and
sees Annie hands on her face then clapping as she offers him a ride home
in her car

Annie opening the door to Alvy the night he came over to kill the spider
Annie

and Alvy in the bookstore buying the Death titles Annie and Alvy in
their Hamptons house Annie reading a school catalogue the night Alvy puts
in the red light

The memories continue to flash on the screen Annie and Alvy at a friends
house Alvy blowing the cocaine all over the sofa Annie and Alvy playing
tennis Annie and Alvy having a picture taken backstage at the college
performance in Annies hometown Alvy bolding Annie close the night he came
over to kill the spider

And continue Annie carrying her luggage and clothes into Alvys bedroom
Alvy

following the day she first moved into his apartment Annie holding up her
sexy birthday present from Alvy then leaning over and kissing him Annie and
Alvy walking down a city street holding each other close sitting on the
park

bench observing the people and kissing on the FDR Drive the New York City
skyline behind them

The music stops

Returning to the present the camera focusing through the cafe window shows
Annie and Alvy across street They look about at the city traffic Lunch is
over its time

Alvy and Annie shake hands and kiss each other friendly like Annie crosses
the street Alvy watching her go Then he turns and slowly walks down the
street off screen His voice is heard over the scene

ALVYS VOICE-OVER
After that it got pretty late And we
both hadda go but it was great seeing
Annie again right I realized what a
terrific person she was and-and how much
fun it was just knowing her and I-I
thought of that old joke you know this-
this-this guy goes to a psychiatrist and
says Doc uh my brothers crazy He
thinks hes a chicken And uh the
doctor says Well why dont you turn
him in And the guy says I would but
I need the eggs Well I guess thats
pretty much how how I feet about
relationships You know theyre totally
irrational and crazy and absurd and
but uh I guess we keep goin through it
because uh most of us need the eggs
