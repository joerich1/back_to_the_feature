EXT KENNEDY MIDDLE SCHOOL OUR POV - NIGHT We’re staring UP AT the monolithic brick school A
symbol of prepubescent hell

CAMERA DARTS DOWN TO a pair of boyish fifteen-year-old
hands fingernails gnawed into oblivion Stained with

bike grease they fumble with a combination lock The

BREATHING continues

Teenybopper TITTERING assaults us from the left CAMERA
WHIPS catches the cadre of seventh grade girls -- a
flurry of hair scrunchies and party dresses -- piling out
of a station wagon No one makes eye contact with the
camera but that doesn’t stop us from RISING and ZOOMING
IN ON SHELLEY a pretty twelve-year-old

Nervous the hands rub against a powder blue tuxedo
shirt We MOVE WITH our BOY as he closes in behind the
girls The CAMERA BOUNCES WITH his herky-jerky uneven
steps

Boy (0S)
Hi Shelley

Shelley rolls her gorgeous blue eyes in disgust She
looks down at the Boy’s feet and wrinkles her nose
CAMERA FOLLOWS the gaze to expose cruelly pigeon-toed
feet clad in thick black orthopedic shoes

INT MIDDLE SCHOOL GYM - NIGHT

We’ve entered a Valentine Day’s dance It’s just as
awful as you remember it TIFFANY’S horrific cover of I
Think We’re Alone Now booms from a PA system -

The CAMERA takes it all in On a banner “CUPIDS BALL
19881 A blur of red and white streamers and heart-
shaped balloons A flash of the rented fog machine the
disco ball the teachers standing guard over punch bowls

A glance of pre-teen boys gathered in packs pretending
to ignore the groups of pre-teen girls Some of the kids
wear plastic cherub masks -- obvious party favors that
will clutter their closets for years to come

CAMERA SHUFFLES OVER TO LILY a sixth-grade princess in a
pink gown She holds court with several loyal SUBJECTS

BOY (0S)
Um Lily would you like to dance
with me

LILY
No

The Subjects erupt into laughter

SUBJECT 1

They toss their hair and float off We TURN spot the
class bad girl PAIGE posing defiantly in her black
mini-skirt and stilettos She’s definitely packing
cigarettes in her purse The Boy approaches cautiously

PAIGE

Suddenly we’re PUSHED FROM BEHIND Right AT Paige An
eighth grade BULLY circles around gets up in the Boy’s

CAMERA PUSHES THROUGH a crowd of awkward faces
approaches the dance floor where exuberant girls and
vhythm-impaired boys bop up and down like Belinda
Carlisle A quick peek at each brace-covered mouth or
acne-covered cheek or hand darting to cover an exposed
bra strap Here and there flashes of cherub masks

We TURN and LAND ON DOROTHY a plump shy girl Her eyes
rove A clique of seventh graders moves past her As
they do they snort like pigs

Dorothy makes a paranoid inventory of the gym She looks
straight INTO the CAMERA and realizes that the Boy heard
everything Finally he steps forward and INTO our VIEW
He has a bird-like face and dark hollow eyes

DOROTHY
What are you looking at

BOY
Dorothy I --

DOROTHY
Get away

BOY

I just wanted to ask you --

DOROTHY
Leave me alone pigeon shit

The Bully appears out of nowhere

BULLY
Is Jeremy bothering you Dorothy

Dorothy backs away -- uncomfortable in the spotlight
The Bully shoves the Boy

BOY
I didn’t do anything

A crowd of onlookers has gathered Dorothy starts to
panic

DOROTHY
He’s -- he’s been following me all
night Asking me if I’1ll make out
with him under the bleachers

judgmental gazes

There’s no escape TIFFANY still belts her heart out
but the KIDS have their own song

KIDS
Pigeon shit Pigeon shit
Careful you might step in it

It’s utter chaos The Boy’s orthopedic shoes sail into
the air Wild hands hot-potato them around the gym

KIDS
Pigeon shit Pigeon shit
Careful you might step in it

Shirt and pants are wrestled away exposing the concave
chest the dingy Penney’s briefs Spindly crooked legs
Serawny arms frantically try to cover up A punch cup
goes flying Hits him in the head Red liquid spills
down his pale torso

KIDS
Pigeon shit Pigeon shit
Careful you might step in it

Paige shoves a chocolate cupcake down into his underwear

Were TIGHT ON the Boy’s trembling face as he watches the
circus-like proceedings Blood trickles from one nostril
-- an involuntary nosebleed In shock he stands and
calmly tries to walk through the crush of jeers but the
Kids push him back

Someone drapes a tangle of crepe paper over his head
The Kids spin him around and around

The Boy snaps tries to fight back with a wild and
girlish punch Four boys easily tackle him to the
ground They grab at his underwear Threadbare seams
begin to give way exposing the runny brown cupcake
frosting The Boy howls like a cornered animal

PULL UP as the crowd grows and surges with a sinister
life of its own The Boy is swallowed by the mob

Pigeon shit Pigeon shit
Careful you might step in it

STOP ON the banner CUPID’S BALL 1988 and the frozen
poster-painted grin of a cupid’s face Gradually the

INT GROSS ANATOMY LAB - NIGHT

MOVING PAST colorful anatomical charts sign-up sheets
for study groups and jars of organs An ancient
epitaph donated by some miserable student is etched
into the black surface of a lab table ANATOMY SUCKS
The letters are deep jagged obviously augmented every
year with scalpels and ballpoint pens From a corner a
skeleton smiles out over the room Two red carnations
protrude from his empty eye sockets

ON CHALKBOARD

Another epitaph EXAM TOMORROW 1000 AM The room
is quiet empty until

SHELLEY (0S)
Transversus abdominis

BACK OF ROOM

A drawn privacy curtain is lit from within PUSH IN
THROUGH a crack in the fabric to find Shelley wearing a
white lab coat She holds an open anatomy manual in one
arm and hovers over an open body bag Books and handouts
are scattered everywhere Her eyes droop with
exhaustion They move back and forth from the book to --

BODY BAG
Labelled GREG Inside the object of her scrutiny
wears only one expression -- dead The pickled smooth

skin of his chest torso and abdomen is the palest
white From a valve at the foot of the bag fluids drip
into a collection pan

Shelley picks up her scalpel hovers over the left side
of Greg’s abdomen

The quivering blade moves closer Touches the skin
Pushes in ever so slightly Stops

Shelly glances into her cadaver’s face She can’t make
the first cut

SHELLEY
(to Greg)
You won’t feel it I promise

She waits for an answer None comes Finally she grabs
a medical sheet and drapes it over Greg’s face and upper

body Now just a milky stretch of the abdomen is
exposed

Shelly reaches over to a battered RADIO sitting ona
rolling equipment cart She CRANKS IT UP

Less than a week ‘til the big v-
Day The most romantic holiday on
the planet To keep cupid happy
I’ve got a block of love songs to
break your heart and keep you
misty

SHELLEY
Perfect

DI (V0)
But first by request this upbeat
little number from 1988 You’re
listening to KNUR- FM San
Francisco’s best tunes

TIFFANY’S rendition of I Think We’re Alone Now bops
across the airwaves Shelley scowls hating the song
but her focus in on her scalpel as it moves in for the
target

There’s a CLATTER from outside the privacy curtain
Startled Shelley drops her instrument

SHELLEY
Hello

She peeks her head through the crack It takes a moment
for her eyes to adjust to the low light but the room is
empty

Rusty RINGS SCREECH on the metal bar as Shelley pulls
aside the curtain and flicks on another bank of lights

There’s another CLATTER Shelley jumps and looks
toward --

The door next to her Hand-painted letters on the glass
read LOCKER ROOM

INT GROSS ANATOMY LAB - LOCKERS - MOMENTS LATER
Shelley cautiously pokes her head into the room

SHELLEY

She searches the wall for a light switch finds it
There’s a fluttering strobe as the overhead lighting
fights to turn on

BEHIND SHELLEY

A silhouette appears over her shoulder just behind the
door Motionless Waiting

The LIGHT POPS and goes out BLACKNESS A nearly
inaudible whisper --

VOICE Dance with me

A weak green fluorescent light floods the room Shelley
pivots to look behind her The silhouette is gone She
looks deeper into the locker room Thirty lockers line
either side No one The last locker on the right is
half open obscuring what lies behind it

Shelley strides further into the room when the bank of
FLUORESCENTS once again SPUTTERS and goes out She
freezes There’s a CREAK of METAL HINGES and the lights
come back on

The once-open locker is now almost completely closed

Shelley marches to the last locker and rips it open She
stifles a scream as she sees --

Her own flustered reflection in the locker mirror

She slams the door moves to her own locker and unlocks

it Extracting a ponytail holder she notices the shiny

pink envelope taped to the inside of the door A length
of crimson ribbon ties it up in an intricate bow

Shelley opens the envelope to find -- an antique
valentine

The lace-edged card is lettered in gold Our hearts by
love united Nor days nor nights can sever Our bodies
may be parted Our hearts love on forever

A white tassel is attached to the center of the card
She pulls it and the face separates and lifts into a
paper cage Through the delicate bars --

A rosy-cheeked girl kisses a skeleton

“At the bottom it’s signed with a heart and a J

Confused she lets go of the tassel and the card snaps
back into place With a whoosh it sails into the trash

INT MED SCHOOL HALLWAY - NIGHT

Shelley peers out AT us through the glass window of the
anatomy lab door Unable to see anything she steps into
the hall Her feet skid a little as she walks halfway
down it

At the far end of the dark corridor --

A janitor stows his mop and bucket in a closet and pushes
out the exit doors

Relieved she re-traces her slippery path

INT GROSS ANATOMY LAB - NIGHT

Shelley strides to the radio With a CLICK she SILENCES
TIFFANY forever Attention shifts to the medical
dictionary

SHELLEY
The fibers run perpendicular to
one another at a 45 degree angle
to the transverse plane

White skin still peeks out from underneath the sterile
drape Shelley bends to retrieve her scalpel She finds
it takes a deep breath and moves the edge of the blade
ever closer to the cadaver’s exposed epidermis Almost
there she notices --

The abdomen rising and falling Taking a breath

Shelley screams The scalpel goes flying She bolts
back spins and locks eyes with --

Her cadaver’s face slamming against the glass of the
locker room door

The weight of his body pushes it open and he lands at
her feet

As she stares in horror at the sight before her we
see --

A form on the dissection table sit up The sheet is
pulled away to reveal --
CHERUB MASK

Waxy rosy full-cheeked like that of a Botticelli angel
Behind it the eyes are cold

Script provided for educational purposes More scripts can be found here httpwwwsellingyourscreenplaycomlibrary

WIDER

A gloved hand tugs down a powder blue tuxedo shirt and
white dinner jacket to cover his once-exposed abdomen

Shelley doesn’t realize the danger approaching until the
red ribbon is around her throat Hands yank and the
ligature digs deep into the skin

She tries to yell but the effort is useless The thick
ribbon cuts off her air supply She writhes twists
looks up into the face of the cherub

He pulls her back to the lab table but Shelley jerks
scattering the dissection kit across the room

The cherub tightens the noose with a fierce tub His
victim’s head spins Bulging eyes glimpse a silver flash
of the scalpel resting underneath the lab table
Summoning everything she throws a punch stunning the
cherub and knocking his mask askew Gasping for breath
she pitches herself over the table and slams to the
floor

The scalpel is inches away She reaches for it fingers
almost to the handle when the cherub’s foot crashes onto
her hand crushing it instantly Shelley moans follows
the line of her attacker’s black tuxedo pants up to the
blue ruffled tuxedo shirt white dinner jacket and
withered red boutonniere

The cherub picks up the scalpel straddles her and
raises the blade With one last burst Shelley buries
her foot deep into his stomach The cherub sinks to the
floor

INT MED SCHOOL HALLWAY - NIGHT

Shelley slams out the lab doors

SHELLEY
Help

She skids across the glistening floor still wet from the
janitor’s mopping Arms flying she holds her balance
and pedals on Her eyes sweep the far-off foyer for any
sign of life

INT MED SCHOOL FOYER - NIGHT

Shelley careens into the foyer

AT SECURITY DESK

A portable TELEVISION BASKETBALL GAME BLARING is the
only thing in sight

Shelley throws herself against the exit door It won’t
budge

DOWN HALL

The anatomy lab door opens The cherub appears scalpel
glinting in his hands He locks onto his target and
moves toward her Slow deliberate slightly pigeon-toed
steps

BACK TO SCENE

Shelley scrambles for traction but the slick floor won’t
allow it Clawing at the air she hangs a right and
flies down another shadowy corridor In the distance
the cherub’s FOOTSTEPS ECHO in pursuit She opens a
stairwell door and slips inside

He’s not far behind her

INT BASEMENT HALLWAY - NIGHT

The cherub steps into the empty corridor He reaches out
for a doorknob Twists Locked He tries another
Nothing Finally one gives way

INT CADAVER ROOM - NIGHT

The door swings open and a light clicks on The cherub
stands in the cadaver room Ten body bags five on each
side rest end-to-end on their respective carts He
waits for a noise Nothing greets him but dead
stillness He turns to go Stops

Moving to one of the bags he jerks the zipper down
exposing the corpse of an old woman Her body is stiff
and bloated Hands blazing the cherub moves through the
makeshift aisle unzipping as he goes

He reaches the last bag yanks the zipper and greets a
dead man whose open mouth is a checkerboard of missing
teeth His thirty-eight inch belly sags open Theres a
slight movement from beneath the body and the corpse
explodes upward revealing Shelley The cherub recoils
but the body slams into him forcing him back

Script provided for educational purposes More scripts can be found here httpwwwsellingyourscreenplaycomlibrary

Covered in formaldehyde Shelley tugs on the zipper of
the body bag It’s stuck just above her knees

The scalpel slides across her fingers Shelley drops
back screams gags as soaking strands of hair fall
across her mouth The cherub stuffs her arms to her
sides There’s a horrifying ZING as the zipper slides up
to her collarbone Immobilized Shelley strains against
the body bag

SHELLEY
Please

The cherub stares at his victim A trail of blood
dribbles from his nostril Ignoring it he moves in
puts the scalpel to Shelley’s neck and pulls A crimson
path opens in its wake

Shelley’s eyes glaze over in shock The cherub shoves
her head deep into thick rank ooze One more zip closes
everything off

The cherub steps back and watches as the bag jerks
squirms then ceases to move altogether After a moment
he goes

Silence fills the room then scattered drops then a
trickle At the foot of the cart the fluid collection
pan begins to fill with blood

Someone watches Dorothy head for the hillside steps that
lead to the entrance of the Wheeler family mansion

The shadow steps out

AT FOOT OF STAIRS

Dorothy hears the SHOES on the sidewalk She turns
peers across the street

The shadow ducks out of view again

EXT WHEELER MANSION - SAME TIME

Dorothy darts up the stairs and onto the porch She
rings the DOORBELL then knocks There’s no answer She
searches through a jumble of keys

A shadow falls at the foot of the stairs

Well those were the strangest
looking crunches I’ve ever seen

As the argument in the back of the house continues
Dorothy peeks into the adjoining living room

On the couch an elderly MAID watches TELEVISION
Dorothy ducks back into the foyer where FRANK WHEELER
an industrialist in his fifties chases LAUREN WHEELER a
cackling trophy wife in her twenties up the stairs with
a smack of the ass Their argument is obviously over
Dorothy shudders and grabs a pile of mail She sorts
through and is shocked to see the red envelope addressed
to her Dorothy tears into it A chubby cupid smiles
from the face of an elaborate card She reads
DOROTHY

‘Tis all in vain your putrid

looks You never can incline With

all your girdles rouge and

curls To find a Valentine’

It’s signed with a heart and shaky cursive handwriting --

Horrified Dorothy drops the card The DOORBELL CHIMES

The Maid makes no move to answer

Jennifer sings along

RADIO CHORUS JENNIFER
‘San Francisco in the morning’

CHET BAKER’S My Funny Valentine comes through the
speaker Jennifer shivers

JENNIFER
Ew

The water is still flowing Jennifer sticks a naked arm
through the shower curtain

The radio is just out of reach Jennifer strains Her
fingertips brush the volume control but she can’t get a
grip Jennifer lunges knocking the radio over And
then something out of your mother’s arsenal of water
safety horror stories happens --

The RADIO STILL ON bounces off the closed toilet seat
and between the wall and shower curtain

Jennifer thinks fast shoots out a hand catches the
handle It slips in her sudsy fingers drops and falls
into the water with her Jennifer closes her eyes and
waits for the first jolt

Nothing The RADIO has fallen SILENT
Jennifer slams off the water then peeks out behind the
curtain to the electric socket The force of the fall
has unplugged the cord

container of bottled water inside Thrilled she grabs

It’s only got two sips-worth left Useless She tosses
it toward the trash can Swish Basket

tickling her neck and arms She turns to slam down the
phone when she sees --

The open front door

Not cracked Not ajar Wide open leaving her
absolutely vulnerable

Jennifer spots a field hockey stick propped in a corner
She sweeps it up Thank God she’s in a studio One
glance checks the kitchen It’s clear She drops to her
knees Under the bed is okay but --

The closet looms ahead The door is tightly shut It
stares her down almost threatening her to open it Will
she bite

Yes Jennifer throws open the door The stick crashes
into the closet jabs wildly at empty hangers skirts
and overcoats Jennifer jumps back and surveys her

handiwork No one Just a lot of battered clothes
Shaken pissed at the mess she slams the closet door
then hears from the outside hallway --

THUMP THUMP

head out

Jennifer looks down the hall at the elevator The doors
open shut open shut with a clatter

Grasping the towel tightly around her Jennifer creeps
closer and discovers something blocking the door’s path
Curious she bends to retrieve it

It’s a plastic cherub mask We’ve seen this before -- at

eyeholes and shivers

Lily wanders down the corridor A stuttering strobe
light flashes erratically Red Red Black On the
walls surrounding her projected portraits of cupids
drift lazily to and fro The images are haunting but
beautiful She stops to admire them

The strobe flashes and she comes face to face with the

cherub It’s impossible to tell whether he’s part of the

Blood dribbles from the cherub’s nostril Lily staggers
backward and runs

glances over her shoulder she takes a turn into a dead
end Backtracking she slams into the cherub recognizes

INT MATCH ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Ropes and long panels of red fabric hang from an
intricate system of pulleys They undulate in sensual
waves

Projected on a far well is super-8 film of couples
kissing and moaning The footage is blown up so large
that it looks like pointillism

Lily stumbles straight into a fabric panel jumps back
She puts a crimson-soaked hand over her mouth and burrows
deeper into the wall to dodge the light from the film
screen

The loss of blood is finally affecting her She swoons
then regains her concentration Weaves among the flowing
panels The door is only fifteen feet away

Lily takes another step but something catches her foot
She looks down barely has time to register the rope that
tightens around her ankle With a whizz she’s jerked
upside-down and six feet into the air

The cherub mask flashes into her eyeline

Her plea is cut short by another stab to the throat The
force of the blow sends Lily swinging across the room

Upside down she reaches the end of her arc and flies
back in the direction of the cherub Feet kicking arms
flailing she catches a fabric panel and halts her
trajectory

The cherub calmly reaches behind another fabric panel and
removes a bow and arrow

Lily grips the fabric panel for dear life but her slick
hands and dwindling strength cause her to lose hold She
flies back in the cherub’s direction

He’s ready and aimed at his moving target As she swings
by -- THWACK The ARROW nails its intended mark Lily’s
heart A maroon pool blossoms across her chest She
gasps

THWACK THWACK Two more ARROWS find a home inside
Lily

Bewildered eyes stare at the film footage of the couples
kissing Blood runs down her neck and covers her face
Before the stream can hit the ground --

Gloved hands grab a nearby fabric panel and tug it down
Within seconds the body is wrapped up Lily’s contorted
face is the only thing left exposed

The cherub grabs a nearby rope and bears down on it with

his full weight Lily’s body flies thirty feet up to the
ceiling The sea of pulleys ropes and fabric block it

from sight

The match room door opens

The cherub steps back into the shadows as Jennifer
enters

UP IN RAFTERS

Lily sees her friend She gurgles Tries to make noise
Two drops of blood drip onto the floor -- five feet from
Jennifer

Jennifer is unaware gazing at the super-8 footage
Suddenly she senses a presence She turns but the
panels of fabric drift and block her view She sees the

corner of a black sleeve disappearing starts around
panel when suddenly --

He moves in wraps an arm around her Jennifer squirms
out from under it

What about Lily

MAX
She dumped me Said something
about a business trip You chicks

Lily continues to fight against the confines of her
bloody restraints

Max leans in to kiss Jennifer

MAX

He tries again

heard

defense we have against jerks like
you

under the flowing water

Fuck

Covered in suds Campbell climbs out of the tub Water
and bubbles slosh all over the marble floor He slips
nearly crashing to the ground

CAMPBELL
Shit

He carefully maneuvers over to the standing shower yanks
ON the WATER and steps inside

The suds instantly wash away unmasking --

Dozens of leeches stuck to Campbell’s naked body
They’re fat around the middle engorged from their
feeding

Campbell sees the parasites and screams He jumps out of
the shower smacking and yanking at them The leeches

hold fast -- clamped on by their razor sharp teeth

Yelling Campbell pulls at a giant leech on his arm It
stretches stretches and finally rips in two Blood
gushes from the animal’s innards Campbell’s blood The
leech’s head is still stuck to Campbell’s arm

Campbell runs for the door His feet slide out from
under him and he crashes heavily to the marble He sits
up and slaps at his thighs scrambles to his feet and
tears the leeches from his skin He manages to rid them
from his arms and torso Campbell turns and we see --

The monster leech on his back He senses it too
Strains his neck in an attempt to look over his shoulder

Campbell strides to the mirror wipes the steam from it
The cherub’s reflection appears behind him A stream of
blood dribbles from a nostril Campbell doesn’t

notice -- he’s too busy reaching stretching trying to

grab the leech

The cherub’s reflection finally catches his eye
Startled he spins to face him -- sees the waxy face
frozen in a wicked grin

CAMPBELL
Who the fuck are you

The question is cut short as a fifty-pound barbell caves
in Campbell’s skull He flies backward and slams to the
floor

CLOSE ON Campbell’s arm as it twitches on the marble A
leech lets go and creeps across the floor

thrash version of Billy Joel’s Just the Way You Are”
Miserable and alone she looks out over the dancing mob
Her eyes lock on --

EDGE OF DANCE FLOOR

And the leering cherub mask As quickly as it’s there
it’s gone

Tossed about by moshers Dorothy heads in the mask’s
direction Heads and shoulders spin about A dancer
bumps her knocking her to the ground Rude guests have
left the floor littered with beer cigarette butts and
plastic cups Dorothy looks in horror at her soaked
hands her ruined dress Then in front of her she sees
a discarded cherub mask

Dorothy reaches for it A dancing foot kicks it away

Paige looks around Lightheaded Trying to get her
bearings

JACUZZI

GURGLES and HISSES seductively at the other end of the
terrace Paige undoes a clasp and throws back the
plastic cover The WIND whips up Shuddering she sheds
her dress and heads for the steaming turquoise water

PAIGE
Ouch
Paige retracts her stubbed foot Looks down Notices
the pile of plumber’s tools that Campbell has left hidden
to one side of the tub She shakes off the pain and
slips into the water

Head falls back Bubbles rush up to her neck

A JET BACKFIRES sending a splash up and over Paige’s
face She opens her eyes and wipes the chlorinated water
from her lips Pulling a hand back she notices the wet
rose petal stuck to her palm Paige sits up

Rose petals cover the surface of the Jacuzzi

She looks to the French doors A dark figure watches
from the shadows Instinctively Paige covers herself

PAIGE
Hey freakshow --

The cherub steps INTO VIEW -- his knife at his side

CLOSE ON MASK
On the eyes behind it seeing Paige’s horror
On the mouth curled in mad delight

On the drips of blood that ooze from the nose

BACK TO SCENE

Paige screams Gets to her feet The blade swings
toward her chest but she jumps back slips falls end
over end out of the Jacuzzi to the hard terrace floor

PAIGE
Help me

The JACUZZI MOTOR and the MUSIC downstairs drown out her
eries

The cherub closes in Paige stands but her wet feet
stick to the cold slate terrace She backpedals falls
hard with a fearful whimper

KNIFE

The other hand draws back and punches her in the face
Her head snaps back from the blow and she lets go of the
killer’s wrist She falls against the terrace wall

Head rolls back Catching a glimpse of --

TERRACE

below Oblivious guests smoke and laugh

BACK TO SCENE

Paige tries to yell but can’t muster the breath The
cherub swipes at her throat She steps back on wobbly
feet barely avoiding the blade It swings again Paige
swerves but the Jacuzzi blocks her way With a vicious
shove the cherub knocks her back into the water

UNDERWATER

Her body drops Wild eyes look up for a sign of the
attacker but he’s out of sight Paige pushes up as --

The plastic cover crashes onto her shoving her back
under It’s a flurry of jets and bubbles Paige
struggles to get her bearings Pushes back up The
cherub’s face meets hers through the clear plastic

He kneels on the cover

ON PAIGE
realizing what’s happening

With a flick the cherub secures the cover with the clasp
and steps back onto the terrace

Feet kick Fingernails claw at the hard plastic Paige
shoves her face into a tiny air pocket but a new rush of
bubbles and water obliterates it The hot chemical
infused water burns at her eyes but she focuses spots
another air pocket inches away Moves for it when --

EIGHT-INCH DRILL BIT

punches through the cover As soon as it’s there it’s
gone

CHERUB

Outside the cherub holds the plumber’s DRILL A squeeze
of the trigger sends a MECHANICAL WHIR across the
terrace

Paige notes the tiny air hole Lips close around it
Suck in a trickle of precious oxygen

The drill slams through the cover again -- this time
inches from Paige’s face She steals another breath and
darts away Unfortunately full lungs increase her
buoyancy She floats to the surface The drill bit
plunges through the water and into Paige’s arm A bubbly
scream mixes with the blood from the puncture wound

The cherub smiles pleased with himself He watches as
his victim huddles against the bottom of the Jacuzzi
Paige bangs the cover with her feet Her wild eyes beg
for a reprieve

Another air hole opens with a ZING of the DRILL Like a
starved goldfish Paige zooms to the surface inhales
madly The DRILL JABS again this time near her chest
and she retreats to a corner

Bloody clouds fill the water Paige has little left in
her Head spinning chest heaving she takes her first
underwater breath and gags Now it’s only a matter of
seconds

The cherub realizes this He clicks off the DRILL’s
safety control and it RUNS of its own accord

Paige slams the plastic again Takes another deadly
inhale

In one move the cherub unlatches the cover and tosses
the still running drill into the tub Sparks fly the
minute it hits the water The cherub slams the cover
back into place

ON PAIGE

Feeling the first jolts of ELECTRICITY racing into her
body Boiling her alive She convulses Eyes gape A
last bubble parts her lips and her face turns to a
gruesome mask of terror

CUT TO

INT BEDROOM - TIGHT ON DUFFEL BAG - NIGHT

as deliberate hands unzip and rifle through it

Taking advantage of the moonlight Ruthie shakes the
contents onto the floor Like a mad archaeologist her
fingers pick through socks and toiletries There’s no
sign of a checkbook or wallet Something gleams in the
darkness It’s the Rolex

There’s a NOISE outside

Ruthie pockets the watch and slips to the door She
cracks it

INT HALL

Jennifer zooms past with a flashlight

Ruthie ducks back inside waits a beat then looks again
The hall is clear

INT HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS ACTION

surroundings are spartan but Ruthie doesn’t spend much
time looking She heads down the steps two at a time

GROUND LEVEL

A service entrance Ruthie tries the door Locked She
continues down the steps and into the basement

INT BASEMENT - BILLIARDS ROOM - NIGHT

A red-velveted pool table commands the middle of the
floor The balls are racked and ready for play Ruthie
blows into the room

RUTHIE
Fuck me

Frustrated she perches on the edge of the pool table and
scatters the balls across the velvet Ruthie pulls out
the Rolex and fastens it on her wrist

The door to the billiards room opens and a man backs
inside He’s dragging something

RUTHIE
Hey How the hell do I get out of
this place

The cherub turns around looks at her quizzically drops
his cargo

Ruthie stares in horror as he takes a step toward her
revealing the Maid’s dead body

RUTHIE
Well I should go

Pretending not to see the mess she tries to step around
him A drop of blocd spills from the cherub’s nose He
pulls his knife Charges

Script provided for educational purposes More scripts can be found here httpwwwsellingyourscreenplaycomlibrary

The blade sinks into Ruthie’s back She screams at the
white-hot pain watches in horror as the knife rises
again She twists away thinks fast and grabs a pool
cue out of a nearby rack Swings it Bashes the cherub
in the kidney He falls back Groggy bleeding Ruthie
drops her weapon and charges out the door

INT BASEMENT HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Screaming she tears down the hallway but she’s deep in
the bowels of the house No one can hear her
Fortunately the darkness is thick and black Perfect
for hiding She opens a door and slips into --

INT BASEMENT BATHROOM - NIGHT

So so dark Ruthie fumbles to get her bearings in the
pink marble bathroom

The lights flash on Someone found the circuit breaker

Ruthie stares at her teary reflection in the bathroom
mirror The wound in her back bleeds profusely

From the hall there’s a CLATTER

Ruthie spies the dry sauna She flips off the bathroom
light switch and heads for it

INT DRY SAUNA - CONTINUOUS ACTION

It’s dark in here Instinctively Ruthie drops to her
knees and backs under one of the benches Her eyes never
waiver from the door until something brushes her
shoulder Ruthie looks down at the human arm that drapes
across her chest She screams pushes it away turns to
see Campbell His face or what’s left of it is cloaked
in a final silent scream

Hyperventilating Ruthie pushes the corpse off of her and
slides out

INT BASEMENT BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Ruthie bolts for the exit when she hears another NOISE in
the hall She backs away from the doors and spies
WICKER LAUNDRY HAMPER

In a flash she’s inside

INT LAUNDRY HAMPER - NIGHT

It’s a tight fit but Ruthie burrows into a pile of musty
towels Her breathing is jagged terrified She closes
her eyes calms herself

There’s a RIP as the pool cue slams through the top of
the hamper millimeters from Ruthie’s terrified face

She screams Presses up against the side as the cue
slams through the front With everything she’s got left
Ruthie blasts out of the hamper

INT BASEMENT BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Spills end over end onto the bathroom floor The cherub
hovers over her Aims for her head Swings Ruthie
rolls and he misses She gets to her feet and tears out
of the bathroom The killer rams the cue back into the
hamper and pulls his knife

INT SERVICE STAIRWELL - NIGHT

Gathering strength Ruthie climbs for her life She
passes the service entrance knowing already that it’s
locked

SECOND FLOOR

Ruthie arrives at the door that got her into this mess
She tries the knob It doesn’t budge

FOOTSTEPS come from below Ruthie darts up another
flight

THIRD FLOOR

She cranes her neck and gazes down into the twisting
dropping maze of stairs and banisters

TWO STORIES BELOW

A hand clasps the railing Deliberate FOOTSTEPS make
their ascent

Ruthie spins and runs up the steps taking three at a
time

The cherub continues his methodical climb

FOURTH FLOOR

The attic level One door stands at the top of the
stairs Ruthie tries it No good She pounds kicks
claws at the wood

RUTHIE
Help me

The footsteps stop Ruthie twists to find nothing She
blinks Takes one step down at a time

RUTHIE

Please don’t hurt me
(another step)
I don’t want to die

She stops Listens Nothing She makes it to the
landing Breathes easier now Looks over the edge of
the banister thinks she sees something down in the
twisting dropping maze of the stairwell Looks closer
It’s just one of her high heels Everything looks clear
She turns and --

The cherub shoves her against the railing The force is
bone-crushing rapid fire

Ruthie screams tries to push forward but he shoves her
again WOOD CREAKS as the railing breaks off and
plummets into the abyss Nothing’s left of the banister
but the spindly wooden slats

RUTHIE
No

The cherub shoves again Ruthie loses her footing and
sits back on the slats They give way and she pitches
over the edge

The cherub’s mouth reacts in surprise Ruthie hasn’t
fallen

The Rolex watch too big for her wrist has caught on one
of the slats It bends at a hundred and seventy-five
degree angle but it still supports her weight
She twists in the air stares up into his unfeeling eyes
RUTHIE
Help me Please help me You

can have anything you want

The cherub steps forward Extends a hand And unclasps
the watch

Script provided for educational purposes More scripts can be found here httpwwwsellingyourscreenplaycomlibrary

Ruthie shrieks as her hand slips out of the band and she
drops end over end through the stairwell It’s a messy
interminable fall as her flailing body ricochets against
the unforgiving banisters and slams to the floor

Ruthie’s eyes blink flutter close

gut but she stops herself She has to keep her wits
together She has to get her friend out of there and

She doesn’t know what to do She doesn’t know if he
knows that she knows She’s afraid he’ll kill her if she

He pulls back and looks into her eyes She tries to
accept his stare must not fall apart She gently puts
her head on his shoulder

Tears of fear and horror moisten her eyes as he buries
his head in her hair takes in her fragrance Quickly
he moves to her lips maneuvers her over to a cabaret
table and pushes her back His body presses against
her His hands run down her legs and she trembles

He jerks at the front of her dress Unclasps his belt

A GURGLE of WATER spurts from beneath the cover It
sprays the white skirt of Jennifer’s dress She looks

catches in between two of the broken banister slats

There’s a cruel SNAP as her ANKLE twists but it alters
her path from straight down to a diagonal flight through
the air and onto the staircase

Falling down the stairway Her body slamming into and
rolling over each step with sickening thuds Down
Down To

FIRST FLOOR

She comes to a terrifying rest next to the service
entrance Jennifer is motionless stunned Gasping to
replace the wind knocked out of her lungs

Her hand touches the bloody pool that seeps underneath
her She touches it Touches herself Tries to assess
the damage to her body Turns and realizes that it’s not
her blood --

It’s Ruthie’s Rigor mortis has set in but blood still
seeps from the gaping wound in her stomach Two
splintered banister slats are still embedded in the soft
tissue

Jennifer struggles to get up hurt disoriented her
dress slick with red She looks up to the top of the
stairway Sees no one Jennifer tries the door
Locked She turns and pushes through another one

Jennifer looks down the long corridor The entryway and
front door loom at the opposite end Escape She goes

Her body becoming a machine a fulcrum of perpetual
motion born of her instinet to survive

She’s halfway down the hall Passing a maze of closed
doors And then --

The cherub steps INTO VIEW -- blocking her way

Jennifer’s body tries to catch up with her mind as she
stops her forward momentum spins around and scrambles
back the way she came

paneled walls The taxidermied bear in the corner The
giant mahogany desk -- with the gun in it

She flies for the desk Slides behind it Tries the

drawer Just pricey pens and paper clips She hastens
for another drawer Finds the gun and the box of
bullets

FOOTSTEPS STOP outside the study door

Jennifer sweeps up the gun and bullets and rushes to the
louvered closet at the end of the room

INT CLOSET - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Jennifer shuts herself inside Fumbles with the awkward
cargo in her hands

She drops to the floor burrows back underneath the
winter coats umbrellas and two pairs of feet

Frank and Lauren Wheeler hang by their necks from the

Lauren’s toes brush against Jennifer’s face She
scrambles away is about to scream when --

The study door opens

Jennifer shakes uncontrollably Fighting against the
urge to pass out Trying to load the gun Several
BULLETS drop to the floor with a CLATTER

FOOTSTEPS APPROACH the closet

Jennifer’s breaths are spastic Her fingers scramble to
fit the bullets in the chamber

The FOOTSTEPS are getting CLOSER
Jennifer centers herself in front of the door
The knob turns

A finger tenses against the trigger BAM BAM BAM

She keeps going Mind over-alert Hearing SOUNDS from
everywhere above her behind her Looks back down the

Jennifer charges every cell focused on one thing -- the
front door Her ankle gives way but she keeps running
The marble floor of the foyer gleams It’s almost within
her reach She closes in when --

A CRASH comes from the foyer

Jennifer freezes Cornered Finally losing it she
backtracks down the hall She spots an open doorway
Moves to it Peers into the darkness

There’s a steep wooden stairway that leads into the
basement Jennifer contemplates entering Contemplates
fainting

She doesn’t see -- behind her -- another door opening --
just a crack at first - and then swinging open wide -- a
blur of a figure lunging at her as --

to block the blow Impact The gun goes flying So do
