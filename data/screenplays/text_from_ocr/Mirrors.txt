INT NIGHT - HARLEM SUBWAY STATION 1A

A subway screeches by at full speed revealing a station platform
somewhere in Harlem

A man runs for his life in the deserted space Hes an African
American male in his forties wearing a security guard uniform

He turns into an empty corridor climbs a set of stairs towards
the exit but- The gates are down and the station is closed

Desperate and out of breath he is forced to trace his way back
searching for an exit or a place to hide He sees a door to the
public restroom and runs inside

INT NIGHT - SUBWAY PUBLIC RESTROOM 1B

The place is deserted as well One of the mirrors is smashed
while the others are covered by graffiti and dirt -

The neon lights are flickering bringing the place in and out of
the dark

The man checks each stall one at a time
1B
1B

His face lights up as he looks inside the last one-

A SMALL WINDOW ABOVE THE TOILET IS JUST BIG ENOUGH FOR HIM TO
CRAWL THROUGH

He steps onto the toilet seat but the window is shut too tight
After a brief struggle he swings it open only to discover-

A wall of bricks

Panic returns to his eyes He slowly opens the stall door
fearful of what could be waiting outside

A FAINT SOUND OF SHATTERING GLASS is heard
He quickly shuts the door holding his breath Frozen
Silence

His heart racing he exits the stall in the direction of the
sound The place is empty

The room is revealed by flashes of flickering neon lights

He moves closer to the sinks and the spiderweb cracked mirror
His image is fragmented and deformed It resembles a Cubist
portrait

MAN
Im sorry I I I wasnt trying
to get away

He talks to his own reflection in the mirror-

MAN (CONTD)
No please dont

He approaches and starts crying like a child His head resting
against the mirror he pleads for his life Then seeing the
dirt and grime on the mirror his behaving shifts to another
extreme He starts cleaning it frantically with his hands Too
frantically-
1c
1c

1c
1c

A piece of the spiderweb cracked mirror falls on the ground
Immediately he bends down to pick it up but-

HIS REFLECTION IN THE MIRROR REMAINS STANDING IN SILENCE
WATCHING HIM

Looking up the man realizes his reflection has become
independent A separate being

Terrified he slowly stands staring at his stationary double

The pointy and sharp piece of broken mirror in his hand reflects
the neon lights just like a knife blade

His eyes turn cold with fear when-
HIS DOUBLE IN THE MIRROR STABS ITSELF DEEP IN ITS THROAT

IN REALITY THE MAN HAS NOT MOVED AN INCH YET HIS THROAT RIPS
OPEN RELEASING A RIVER OF BLOOD

Void of any facial expression the mans reflection slices his
jugular from end to end

In reality the man chokes on his own blood which splatters on
the mirror- TURNING THE IMAGE TO A DARK DEEP RED

EXT DAY - NEW YORK

OPENING CREDITS ON-

All the reflections catch in the glass buildings of Manhattan-
The traffic in the streets the old turn-of-the-century facades
the people walking on the sidewalk the pigeons flying away the
Brooklyn Bridge and the Manhattan skyline reflecting off the
surface of the Hudson River

WwW

Seen through the mirrored surfaces everything in the city seems
to move in a distorted way Ominous

The softness of the suns rising light is contrasted with the
eerie haunting music

INT DAY - APARTMENT QUEENS

A WEEK BEFORE
Bip Bip Bip

Its 8 am The blinking digital numbers of the alarm clock
reflect off the wooden floor of the apartment

The sunlight is diffused through the drawn curtains of the
living room

Seen in the reflection of the TV-set a man is sleeping on the

couch He switches off the alarm and rises to go into the
bathroom

BATHROOM - CONTINUITY

Like a thick fog the steam from the shower fills the bathroom
The shower turns off A hand reaches out to wipe away the mist
on the mirror above the sink revealing-

The face of BEN CARSON 41 years old His eyes reflect the
hardships of life A life that from the lines on his face we
suspect hasnt been easy On his chest and shoulder SEVERAL
BULLET SCARS

Ben changes his razor blade and starts to shave his 3 day old
stubble

BEDROOM - CONTINUITY

Ben finishes getting dressed and walks to the half opened
bedroom door

Inside ANGELA is asleep in the bed She is younger than Ben

ANGELA awakens slowly-
ANGELA
What time is it

BEN
Almost 830 Coffee

ANGELA
No youre going to be late

BEN

Go back to sleep Ill call you OK
ANGELA

Yeah I wont be working until later

tonight

He comes to kiss her on the forehead She opens a sleepy eye and
smiles

ANGELA (CONTD)
You shaved

She strokes his face gently

ANGELA (CONTD)
I like it It makes you look younger

Ben slips on his old military parka before leaving

ANGELA (CONTD)
Good luck

BEN
See you later Angie
INT DAY - HALLWAY BUILDING

Ben walks down the hallway The building is old and clearly not
well maintained cracks and graffiti cover the walls

EXT DAY - MANHATTAN

The downtown streets are clogged with the early morning rush
hour traffic

INT DAY - POLICE STATION- MANHATTAN 8

On the honorary board of the NYPD we can read the names of all
the officers decorated for their courage In the reflection of
the copper plate we find Ben sitting on the bench across from
the office of -

8

Captain LARRY BYRNE who appears at the end of the corridor-

LARRY
Sorry Im late Have you been
waiting long

BEN
I just got here

They shake hands

LARRY
You look awful

BEN
Thanks Larry

LARRY
You know you should sleep at night

Ben follows him into the office
9 INT DAY - LARRYS OFFICE 9

Larry takes a seat and briefly looks over the messages and files
that have been dropped off on his desk-

LARRY
So did you find an apartment yet

BEN
No not yet

LARRY

BEN
No Im staying at my sisters in
Queens

LARRY

I didnt know you had a sister What

BEN

Larry looks up at Ben slightly uneasy-

9 9

LARRY (CONTD)

Ben remains silent He obviously doesnt want to get into that
subject

LARRY (CONTD)

BEN

INT DAY- CORONERS OFFICE 10
We discover a whole different world-

In the sterile environment of the NYC Chief Medical Examiners
Office forensic scientists with tape recorders in hand
describe the corpses

We are a world away from the Hollywood clichés of neatly laid
out immaculate cadavers Here some of the corpses have reached
a state of advanced decomposition and others are still frozen in
contorted positions expressing their ultimate agony before
dying From the homeless man fished out of the river to the
woman killed by gun shots each corpse tells his own story

Amidst the group of doctors 35-year-old AMY deeply immersed in
an autopsy is interrupted by her cell phone

Amy checks the display for the incoming call- BEN She hesitates
for a moment and doesnt answer the call

Amy goes back to the postmortem analysis on her tape recorder

EXT DAY - NEW YORK 11

Dozens of pigeons fly away as the above ground subway passes by

11

AMY (0S)
You have reached Amy Carson I am
not available to take your call
Please leave a message and I will get
back to you as soon as I can

Caught in the pouring rain Ben has taken shelter under the
scaffolding at a street corner He plugs his ear with his finger
to block the traffic and city commotion -

BEN

(on Amys voicemail)
Amy its me I just wanted to let you
now that I got a job today Its
nothing special just a security guard
job If you still want to go ahead
with it we can sign the divorce
papers I mean if thats what you
really want
(he hesitates)
Ive been thinking about Michaels
birthday tomorrow It would be nice if

we could celebrate it together You
now for the kids sake Call me
Please

Ben hangs up the phone He lingers under the scaffolding for a
moment watching the falling rain

EXT DAY - NEW YORK 12

The glass skyscrapers mirror the black clouds in the sky above
as they slowly break up giving way to the sun

EXT DAY - MAYFLOWER DEPARTMENT STORE 13

On 38th Street just off of Broadway the Mayflower has
withstood the passage of time and the huge fire that forced it
to shut down-

The damage from the fire is still noticeable on the facade of
the building-

The fire appears to have started on the ground floor and seems
to have spread all the way up to the top Some of the windows
are shattered while others are boarded up What was once an
impressive ornate building a fine example of 1920s
architecture standing on one of Manhattans most dynamic
streets now gives off a feeling of devastation and desolation

What is left of it is a mere ruin a sort of neglected ghost
ship abandoned in the heart of the city

INT DAY - MAYFLOWER 14
The last beams of daylight shine through the broken windowpanes

Inside the department store everything has remained the same
since the fire as if time stood still The display cases the
departments the mannequins and even the clothes are all burnt
or blackened by the fire A thick coat of soot covers the floor
and rainwater drips down all over the place

MAN (0S)
Its been five years and theyre still
in a legal battle with the insurance
companies Even cleaning up that mess
is impossible

In his dark brown uniform the daytime security guard LORENZO
SAPELLI 60s seems pleased to guide Ben through what was once
a temple of beauty and vanity

LORENZO
You know the Meredith family acquired
this building after St Johns
Hospital closed in 1952 It was the
very first Mayflower to open on the
East Coast

On the cracked walls THE HUGE 1920 MIRRORS that have survived
the flames reflect merely the remnants of the past The
customers are long gone and have been replaced by pigeons flying
in and out of the gaps in the roof

LORENZO (CONTD)
The company wants us to patrol the
premises every couple of hours but I
do my rounds every three hours and
thats more than enough Anyway
youll see theres not much going on
Its pretty calm around here

Ben follows Lorenzo through the burnt display counters He
listens but his mind has drifted elsewhere This place makes him
uncomfortable Its not only the lingering smell of a fire but
also a sense of death that hangs over it

The whistling of the wind through the stores old ventilation
system sounds like faraway voices

Ben and Lorenzo appear at the top of the staircase of the 2nd
floor

LORENZO (CONTD)
Here you go Mens department or
whats left of it anyway

14

Ben observes the surroundings- Yet another spectacle of
devastation

LORENZO (CONTD)

hank God you didnt show up any

ater This place gives me the chills
t night No electricity and all
hese mirrors You know I live in
rooklyn near a Jewish neighborhood
nd when someone dies they cover all
he mirrors in their house Some say
hat its just to renounce all vanity
during the mourning period but others
say something else They say its to
keep the soul of the dead from being
trapped in the mirrors Believe it
or not theres always a bit of truth
in any superstition Am I right

tatoo t ory

Amused and skeptical at the same time Ben contemplates the
mirrors that surround him-
LORENZO (CONTD)
I guess you just have to keep your
eyes away from them

Unlike the rest of the scenery THE MIRRORS ARE PERFECTLY CLEAN
AND GLISTENING

BEN
Did you clean them

LORENZO
What

BEN
The mirrors why are they so clean

Lorenzo smiles-

LORENZO
Thats Gary Lewis the fellow who
worked here before you He was
completely obsessed with these damn
mirrors Hed spend the entire night
polishing them

BEN
Why did he leave

LORENZO
No idea Just didnt show up one
night I take it hes found a better
opportunity somewhere else

(MORE)

14 14
LORENZO (CONTD)
Im not one to complain but I never

really liked him much Could never be
bothered to say hello or at least ask
how are you doing I mean damn do

we work together as a team or what
You on the other hand seem like a

nice guy How long has it been since
you left the NYPD

BEN

Its almost night
exit the department store

Almost a year

LORENZO
Why did you resign from the force You
were a detective is that correct

BEN

I was wounded during a holdup It kind

of changed my perspective on things

Ben and Lorenzo reach the next floor

LORENZO
Third floor Ladies department You
gotta be careful here When the wind
blows sometimes the tiles fly off the
roof and theyll just snap your ear
off if you follow what Im saying

Lorenzo checks the time on his watch

LORENZO (CONTD)
Well Ill let you get acquainted with
the rest of the store on your own

They turn around

LORENZO (CONTD)
Follow me Ill show you our
headquarters and Ill get you one of
these uniforms

EXT DUSK - MAYFLOWER - SECURITY GUARD TRAILER

LORENZO
We were a pretty big team working here
before the fire When you stop to
think that of all the department
stores in New York this one was the
most beautiful the most luxurious
breaks your heart it really does

It

Ben and Lorenzo have finished their visit and

15

Outside the building behind the fence blocking its entry a
construction trailer has been outfitted for the guards

LORENZO (CONTD)
Here you go This is where youll be
spending most of your time At least
youve got electricity in here Its
nice and warm and theres even a TV

16 INT NIGHT - SECURITY GUARD TRAILER

Cartoons flicker on an old television set All bundled up in a
coat and wearing a woolen hat a young boy is watching TV
Lorenzo and Ben enter the mobile home-

LORENZO
Lorenzo Junior my grandson Say hello
Lorenzo

LORENZO JR
Hello

LORENZO
Lorenzo and I are going to the movies
tonight

Lorenzo strokes his grandson on the head and proceeds to the
back of the mobile home leaving Ben alone with the child The
boy looks almost hypnotized by the images on TV

BEN
How old are you Lorenzo

LORENZO JR

Lorenzo Jr shifts his attention from the cartoons and stares
Ben in the face-

LORENZO JR (CONTD)
Do you work in the department store

BEN
I do now

LORENZO JR
Grandpa says there are ghosts in the
store Is that true

Ben smiles
BEN

I think your grandpa just wants to
scare you a little

16

Lorenzo Senior has changed clothes and returns with a uniform
which he hands over to Ben-

LORENZO
Here this should fit you Lorenzo
put your coat on We are already late

(to Ben on the sly)
Theres a drop of Jack Daniels in the
cupboard To keep yourself warm

Lorenzo hands over the keys-

LORENZO (CONTD)
Well Ben the place is all yours

Hes about to leave when-

LORENZO (CONTD)
Oh I forgot the most important
thing the flashlights Youll be
needing one of these at night Weve
got two of them They run on
batteries Dont forget to charge
them See you in the morning Ben

BEN
See you tomorrow

Lorenzo and Lorenzo Jr exit the trailer Through the window
Ben sees them walk out to the street

Ben inspects the trailer- scattered with knickknacks the
decoration of the place corresponds well with Lorenzos
personality - warmhearted and humble
The clock on the wall shows 7 pm A long night lies ahead

Ben grabs a flashlight and turns it on The beam of light is
dazzling-

Cut TO

17 INT NIGHT - MAYFLOWER - A FEW HOURS LATER

The flashlight sweeps across the dark entrance hall
Wearing the security guards uniform marked with an embroidered
mM Ben makes his first round of the store
The pigeons perched on the roof seem to observe him
Ben proceeds slowly up the stairs

18 - SECOND FLOOR -

In the Mens department Bens flashlight is a mere luminous
spot twirling in the night
The ever-present mirrors magnify the space to infinity
19 - THIRD FLOOR -

Ben walks through the different sections of the Ladies
department He examines the remains of the charred garments
sagging on the hangers

The silhouettes of the burnt mannequins emerge in the gloom of
the night

STRANGE AND DISTURBING SHAPES REFLECT OFF THE MIRRORS

19A EXT NIGHT - MAYFLOWER
19A
Wide exterior shot-

By night the department stores ornate facade takes on an
entirely different appearance - more menacing almost evil

19B INT NIGHT - MAYFLOWER

19B
Ben continues his rounds
We follow his path through reflections in the mirrors-
AS IF HE WAS BEING WATCHED
Then-
For the first time we discover another perspective another POV
FROM WITHIN THE MIRRORS It feels ominous slightly detached
The sound is muted
Ben crosses back the third floor-
The second floor

23 - ENTRANCE HALL GROUND FLOOR -

In the reflection of one of the grand mirrors in the entrance
hall we see Ben come down the stairs He stops for a moment
facing his reflection in the mirror

He fixes his collar and looks at himself in his new clothes- Not
quite an NYPD uniform
Suddenly his eyes freeze Intrigued he comes closer to the
mirror and leans forward-

A HANDPRINT BARELY VISIBLE ON THE ICE COLD SURFACE

He touches it with the tip of his fingers and tries to rub it
off unsuccessfully He picks up a rag from the ground spits on
the mirror and rubs the mark fervently The print remains This
confirms his hunch-

THE HANDPRINT IS INSIDE THE MIRROR
By angling the flashlight another handprint is revealed
Another And yet another-

THE ENTIRE MIRROR IS COVERED WITH HANDPRINTS JUST AS IF A CROWD
OF PEOPLE ON THE OTHER SIDE HAD PRESSED ITSELF AGAINST THE GLASS
TO GET OUT

As he looks back up in the mirror he sees- THE ACCESS DOOR TO
THE BASEMENT OPENING

Ben turns around His gaze freezes- THE ACCESS DOOR TO THE
BASEMENT IS CLOSED

YET IN THE MIRROR IT CONTINUES TO SLOWLY SCREECH OPEN

Ben swings his head back and forth between the shut door in
reality and the opened door in the mirror What is happening Is
he dreaming or hallucinating

Ben walks backwards towards the basement door keeping his eyes
fixed on the mirror As he goes to reach for the handle he sees
his reflection reaching for the handle of an invisible door

Ben opens it-

THE SYNCHRONICITY BETWEEN THE REAL WORLD AND THE ONE REFLECTED
IN THE MIRROR HAS BEEN RESTORED Ben tries to reenact the
phenomenon He opens and closes the door over and over while
observing his reflection but the mirror is no longer deceitful

The staircase leading to the basement vanishes into the dark
Ben hesitates

36 INT NIGHT - BASEMENT CORRIDOR MAYFLOWER - CONTINUITY

Ben walks down the stairs step-by-step lighting his way with a
flashlight The beam of light dims the battery is almost dead
He gives it a few taps to make the light reappear
Last step-
HIS FOOT LANDS IN WATER
BEN
Fuck
A few inches of water cover the basement floor One of the water
pipes must have burst due to the cold

36

The light flickers back for a moment revealing before him-
the
narrow subterranean corridors of the department store
Along a wall Ben finds a fuse box and pushes some of the
switches Further down in the corridor a couple of fluorescent
lights flicker to life- two tiny sources deep inside the
darkness
AS BEN DISCOVERS HIS SURROUNDINGS THE CAMERA PULLS BACK SLOWLY
UP ALONG THE STAIRS THROUGH THE OPEN DOOR IT ACCELERATES AND
STOPS IN FRONT OF THE MIRROR-
IN THE REFLECTION WE SEE THE BASEMENT DOOR SHUT
FADE TO BLACK
37 EXT DAY - NEW JERSEY STREET

Its been snowing all day and a white coat of powder outlines
the trees and houses

On the front lawn of their house 5 year old MICHAEL and 7 year
old DAISY are building a snowman
MICHAEL
Why did they say on TV that it wasnt
supposed to snow today but tomorrow
instead Why did they lie

DAISY
Sometimes they make mistakes Michael
It happens
MICHAEL

Grown-ups dont make mistakes Only
little children do

Slightly annoyed the little boy places the eyes on the snowman

Daisys face lights up with a big smile when she catches sight
of her fathers car approaching-

DAISY
Daddy

Michael turns around and sees Ben exiting his 1986 Oldsmobile
with a big wrapped package in his arms

The children abandon their snowman and rush towards their
father Ben takes Michael into his arms-

MICHAEL
(pointing to the wrapped
present)
What is that

37

BEN
Well I dont know I just found this
package hidden behind a tree

MICHAEL
Is it for me

BEN
Maybe
(to his daughter)
Daisy has Michael been a good boy
Does he deserve his birthday present
Michael nods

DAISY
No Yesterday he finished the whole
bag of candy when mom had told him he
could only have one piece

MICHAEL
Not true

DAISY
Yes its true

MICHAEL
No its not true Shes lying Daddy

They enter the house

BEN

DAISY

38 INT DAY - HOUSE - CONTINUITY 38

In the kitchen ROSA the nanny is rinsing the dishes from the
afternoon snack-

BEN

38 38
ROSA

BEN

ROSA

BEN
No thank you Ill be fine

Ben takes off his coat and joins the kids in the living room He
hands over the present to his son

Daisy is sitting in the armchair holding her cat TIGER in her
arms

BEN (CONTD)
Happy birthday Michael

MICHAEL
What is it

DAISY
Duh open it stupid

Michael tears away the wrapping paper and discovers a remote
control car The little boy is on cloud nine

39 - LATER IN THE AFTERNOON - 39

Through the front window we see a Volvo station wagon park in
front of the house Amy gets out of the car loaded with
shopping bags She enters the house and hands the groceries over
to Rosa

AMY
Hi Rosa Where are the kids

ROSA
Upstairs
(in a low voice)
With Sefior Ben

The expression on Amys face shifts Noticeably irritated she
goes up to the second floor

Michaels remote control car drives at full speed down the

hallway Ben shows his children how to operate the remote
control while the bathtub fills up He seems as excited as the
kids by the new toy

Ben turns around to find Amy watching them

39

BEN
Hey Amy

MICHAEL
Look Mommy look what Daddy got me

AMY

ts great you will have to show me
how it works

MICHAEL
ts so fast Mommy

AMY
Ben can I talk to you in private

Ben puts down the remote control-

BEN
(to his kids)
Ok kids its time for your bath No
fooling around

Ben follows Amy into the bedroom She closes the door behind
them

INT EARLY EVENING- BEDROOM HOUSE 40

Amy is not equally pleased to see him- Shes beside herself with
anger-

AMY
What is this I already asked you not
to drop by without calling didnt I

BEN
I do but you never take my calls

AMY
I dont need your calls in the middle
of the night Im better off without
them

BEN
I havent had a drink in three months
but then again how would you know

AMY
I dont want to know Ben I dont
want to hear about it Its not my
problem Youre not my problem Youve
done more than enough harm already

BEN
You dont think people can change

AMY
We are not talking about people were
talking about you How many times did
you tell me you were gonna change and
nothing happened It only got worse

Ben moves closer to his ex-wife-

BEN
Just give me another chance

She smiles- How many other chances did she already give him
Behind the firmness and intransigence she conveys we sense Amy
is torn She still loves him as well

AMY
I need more time Ben Listen I will
never stop you from seeing your
children but we have to set up some
rules

Out of nowhere Ben hits the wall with his bare fist-

BEN
WHAT RULES ITS MY SONS FUCKING

BIRTHDAY TODAY COME ON AMY WHAT RULE
IS GOING TO STOP ME FROM SEEING HIM

INT EARLY EVENING - HOUSE BATHROOM

In the bathtub Daisy and Michael cannot avoid overhearing their
parents arguing In denial Michael blocks his ears with his
hands and lies back under the water

BACK IN THE BEDROOM -

Amy seems distrustful of Ben scared of how close he is to the
edge We can see the anger in his eyes

AMY
Look at yourself Youre still
carrying around so much of that anger

He catches a glimpse of his reflection in the mirror- and of the
desperate violence in his eyes Ben steps back

BEN
(trying to calm down)
Im sorry I didnt mean to yell at
you Things could be so different
between us

AMY
Yes I know but its up to you Ben

42

BEN
Yeah Anyway I wasnt planning on
staying My shift starts in an hour
Ill just kiss them goodbye and then
Im leaving

Ben exits the room Amy is left alone-

Through the window she watches Ben exit the house and get into
his car
When she turns away she discovers Michael and Daisy standing
outside the bathtub dripping wet in their towels She smiles
and quickly comes to dry them

MICHAEL
Mom
AMY
Yes honey
MICHAEL

Is Daddy coming back to live with us
She smiles gently

AMY
I dont know sweetheart I dont know

43 INT DAY - BASEMENT CORRIDOR MAYFLOWER 43

The beams from the flashlight are reflected in the few inches of
water flooding the basement corridor Since yesterday the water
level has continued to rise

The outline of Ben and Lorenzos silhouettes appear in the
staircase leading to the ground floor-

BEN
I havent managed to find the source
of the leak My guess is it doesnt

come from the store It must be a
municipal pipe that blew with the
cold

LORENZO

Ill call the company tomorrow morning
and have them come take a look at it

44 INT NIGHT- SECURITY GUARD TRAILER 44

On the gas stove a kettle is whistling

44 44

Ben rummages through the cupboards and the drawers He finds
some instant coffee next to the bottle of Jack Daniels He
briefly hesitates between the coffee and the whisky

He grabs a cup and pours the boiling water into the instant
coffee

In the reflection of the clock we see Ben watching TV It is
past midnight Ben gets up and grabs his flashlight- Its time
for his rounds

INT NIGHT - MAYFLOWER CENTRAL HALL 45

Through the shattered panes of the central dome we see Ben
walking through the store

Since the mysterious occurrences of the night before his
attitude has changed He avoids as much as possible looking
into the mirrors He is on guard fearing another supernatural
manifestation

The shadows the mannequins and the shapes in the mirrors are
all disturbing and unsettling

Even what remains of the sculptures on the top of the marble
columns seems alive in the dark

As he crosses the entrance hall a glint of light catches his
attention Despite himself he stops and gazes into the mirror-

AT THE FAR END OF THE STORE ONE OF THE DEPARTMENTS IS IN FULL
SWING AND BATHED IN DAYLIGHT EVERYTHING IS SPOTLESS AS IF THE
FIRE HAD NEVER TAKEN PLACE CUSTOMERS COME AND GO AS IF NOTHING
HAPPENED

How is this possible Ben turns around to see the same spot in
the real world- ONLY ITS IN RUINS

Ben glances back at the reflection in the mirror-

The vision of the past prevails Unable to ignore it Ben
decides to check it out for himself

Ben wanders off towards the far end of the store a landscape of
dust and desolation HIS REFLECTION IN THE MIRROR ON THE OTHER
HAND HEADS IN THE DIRECTION OF THE FLASHBACK-—

We follow him in the mirror-

Ben has left the night behind and enters the daytime
department Everything is in perfect order and unspoiled

Ben continues his journey into the past

The customers jostle one another while shopping during a big
sale Children run wild in the aisles Women fight over articles
of clothing

Ben stops dead in his tracks when he notices around his shoes
a transparent liquid spilling out on the floor-

He bends down and dips his fingertips into the liquid- GASOLINE

Gallons of flowing gasoline gradually spreading over the floor
of the department store

Ben turns around and sees under the shelving A HAND LIGHTING A
ZIPPO-

The lighter falls to the floor in slow motion

The liquid bursts into flame instantly THE CHEERFUL VISION OF A
DAY IN THE DEPARTMENT STORE QUICKLY TURNS INTO A NIGHTMARE-

EVERYTHING IS ENGULFED IN FLAMES THE CLOTHES THE MANNEQUINS
AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST THE CROWD THE AGONIZING SHRIEKS OF PAIN
AND PANIC ARE DEAFENING

Frightened Ben steps back-

The flames spread quickly to the escalators where the crowd has
rushed to escape death-

HORRIFIC VISIONS OF PEOPLE BURNING ALIVE INCINERATED FLESH
FACES DISTORTED BY THE PAIN SKIN MELTING TO THE BONE

In the midst of the flames through the heat waves Ben spots the
face of the firestarter- IS IT HIS OWN

Ben has no time to react In a split second his uniform catches
fire
Panicked he attempts to put out the fire with his hands-
CUT TO

IN THE DARK NIGHT SURROUNDED BY THE CHARRED RUINS BEN QUIVERS
DELIRIOUSLY AS HE TRIES TO SMOTHER THE INVISIBLE FLAMES

He comes back to reality-

Ben catches his breath trying to come to his senses Whats
happening to him What he just experienced certainly felt real

During his panic the flashlight rolled under one of the
counters

Ben bends down to pick it up The beam illuminates the ground
and throws light on an object a bit further away- A LEATHER
WALLET

45 He stretches out his hand to pick it up The leather is worn-out
but the absence of dust establishes that the wallet has landed
there recently Ben examines the object with the experienced
touch of a professional accustomed to handling evidence
Between the collection of cards and scraps of paper Ben finds a
drivers license belonging to- GARY LEWIS 55 years old a
sturdily built African American man WE RECOGNIZE THE MAN
RUNNING IN THE SUBWAY AT THE BEGINNING The name rings a bell
for him-

46 INT NIGHT - SECURITY GUARD TRAILER

Ben returns to the trailer and rummages through the closet-—

He stops when he finds another uniform A name is embroidered on
the shoulder-

AGAIN THE SAME NAME GARY LEWIS BENS PREDECESSOR THE MISSING
NIGHT WATCHMAN

48A
48A

The wallet rests on the table and piques Bens curiosity He
cannot hold back his police instincts

He finally empties out the contents on the table-

A Blockbuster card restaurant receipts a drivers license
Phillips business card from Mayflower cash and a sheet of
paper folded in four-

Ben unfolds the sheet of paper and sees written in ink-
ESSEKER

Ben chews over these seven letters Is it somebodys name A
place A code Initials He folds it up again and puts
everything back neatly in the wallet that he stows away in one

of the drawers

FADE TO BLACK

EXT DAY - QUEENS STREET

A busy street under the subway overpass We see a neighborhood
bar on the corner-

INT DAY -QUEENS BAR

At this time of day the place is deserted A plasma screen shows
a baseball game A drunk guy is half asleep at the corner table

( )

49
Sitting at the bar Ben is nervous tense He removes the

steeped tea bag from his cup

Ben stares at himself in the mirror behind the bottle display
shelves It is not his mirror image that he is observing His
gaze seems to pierce through his own reflection to dive beyond
into the very depths of his soul
Angela interrupts across from him behind the bar

here

ANGELA
(intrigued)
What are you looking at

BEN
Nothing special

ANGELA
(playfully)
Come on youve been looking at
yourself for more than half an hour
You never used to be so vain

BEN
You cant avoid them Theyre
everywhere

ANGELA
What are you talking about

BEN
The mirrors In the department
store at every street corner in the
windows of every fucking building in
this city I feel like Im not the one
looking into the mirrors but rather
theyre looking at me

Angela smiles not sure if he is serious-—

Ben observes

ANGELA
You need a drink

BEN
No Im serious

ANGELA
Dont you think youre being a little
bit paranoid

ANGELA (CONTD)

Angela smiles at him and continues to polish the drinking
glasses

INT NIGHT - BASEMENT MAYFLOWER 50
In the darkness a rat glides peacefully on the water surface
In the basement the water level continues to rise

With a flashlight in hand and his feet submerged in the water
Ben moves deeper into the tunnel

He is searching for the source of the leak The beam of light
sweeps across the walls and the piping

Ben crosses an intersection In the corner on the tiled wall
he barely discerns an old inscription ingrained with decades of
dust and dirt He sinks his hand into the water and wipes it
off revealing an arrow pointing to ST JOHNS DEPARTMENT OF
PSYCHIATRY

He continues his exploration of the subterranean passageways

Suddenly he notices a darker area on the wall He comes closer
and discovers a brownish damp-spot covered with mold The
humidity has pearled into droplets

He has found the source of the leak

His hand brushes the wall causing it to crumble instantly Ben
digs into the plaster as if it were butter bringing a cracked
water pipe to light The leakage has damaged the wall in which
the tubing was embedded

Ben hears the echoing sound of streaming water as if there were
another room on the other side of the wall

He pushes against the saturated wall and pierces through it
with his arm He removes his arm For a moment he observes the
gaping black hole that he has just left behind

Ben peeks through the hole with his flashlight but he cannot
make out what is on the other side

He makes the hole bigger until the passage is large enough for
him to crawl through-

ON THE OTHER SIDE HE DISCOVERS A LARGE BRICK ROOM AND IN THE
MIDDLE OF IT ANOTHER ROOM- AN OCTAGONAL ONE WHOSE EACH AND EVERY
WALL INCLUDING THE CEILING IS MADE OF GIGANTIC TWO WAYS
MIRRORS

One of the mirrors is opened ajar- Its a door

He enters

His image is reflected in all directions and from infinite
angles Ben moves towards the center of the room-

ALTHOUGH THE ROOM SEEMED EMPTY BEFORE SOMEBODY IS NOW STANDING
IN THE CORNER

Its a well-built man He too is wearing the blue security
guards uniform

From where he stands Ben can only see the back of the mans
head As he moves in closer he can make out the name
embroidered on the mans shoulder-

ITS GARY LEWIS THE FORMER NIGHT WATCHMAN

BEN
Gary

The silhouette remains still

BEN (CONTD)
Gary

Ben comes a bit closer

His gaze freezes when he realizes that Gary is not standing in
front of the mirror with his face pressed against it but-

HE IS BEHIND THE MIRROR INSIDE
Ben steps back terrified

He doesnt know how to interpret this new phenomenon
Ben gathers his courage and returns in front of the mirror-
Knock knock knock

He hits the mirror with his fist as if it were merely a glass
window behind which Gary Lewis was standing on the other side-

No reaction Ben strikes the mirror harder

Knock knock knock

The former night watchman turns around slowly towards Ben
revealing his face little by little

CUT TO
51 INT DAY - QUEENS APARTMENT

Knock knock knock

In his bed Ben wakes up with a jolt- THE ENCOUNTER WITH GARY
WAS A DREAM

Knock knock knock
Somebody is knocking at his door Ben gets up from the couch-

BEN
Coming

Ben opens the door to a UPS deliveryman holding out a package-

DELIVERYMAN
Mr Carson
(Ben nods)
Would you mind signing here please

Ben signs for it and takes the package

DELIVERYMAN (CONTD)

You have a nice day Sir

Ben shuts the door and examines the UPS box Hes not used to
getting many deliveries He flips it over to see who it is from-

THE SENDER IS GARY LEWIS

Ben grabs a kitchen knife to open the parcel He tears away the
cardboard and empties out the contents onto the living room
table-

A DOZEN NEWSPAPER CLIPPINGS LAND ALL MIXED UP ON THE TABLE
More or less recent all the articles relate to the department
store and the fire that burned it down Gary has meticulously
cut them out and sent them to Ben But why

EXT DAY - MAYFLOWER 52

Bens car parks in front of the fence that encloses the entrance
to Mayflower

He runs into Lorenzo who exits the trailer ready to go home
from work-

LORENZO
Ive just been through the craziest
day here No kidding Your ex-

colleagues came to pay us a visit

BEN
What happened

LORENZO
You know Gary the guy who was working
here before you the cops found him
dead in a subway station in Harlem I
never liked him too much but poor
guy he didnt deserve to go like
that

BEN
Did they mention the cause of death

LORENZO
No they wouldnt tell me

Lorenzo hands him over the keys

LORENZO (CONTD)
Well Ben I better get going Mrs
Sapelli is waiting for me at home
Have a good night at work Ben Oh
and by the way about that leak
theyre sending someone over to work
at it the beginning of next week

BEN
Have a good night Lorenzo

Ben remains standing on the landing of the trailer for a moment
his gaze fixed at the department store-

THE WALLET THE DREAM AND NOW ON TOP OF EVERYTHING THE NEWS
OF GARYS DEATH ALL THESE STRANGE COINCIDENCES AROUND HIS

PREDECESSOR HAVE AWOKEN HIS CURIOSITY AND DOUBT BEN WANTS TO
KNOW

INT DAY-NIGHT - MAYFLOWER ENTRANCE HALL

WIDE SHOT OF MAYFLOWER FIRST FLOOR-

IN FAST MOTION- FROM THE FINAL HOUR OF DAY TO THE FALL OF NIGHT
IN THE REFLECTION OF THE MIRRORS LIGHT GIVES WAY TO THE
DARKNESS

The beam from the flashlight appears in the distance-

Determined Ben crosses the entrance hall in the direction of
the basement door

He goes down-

INT NIGHT - BASEMENT MAYFLOWER

Ben appears at the bottom of the stairs with his flashlight and
follows the subterranean passageway

Suddenly he is struck by a frightening feeling of déja-vu HE IS
IN THE VERY ACT OF RELIVING HIS NIGHTMARE IN DETAIL STEP BY
STEP-

In the darkness the rat glides peacefully on the water surface
He crosses an intersection and once again-

He recognizes the half-visible Psychiatric Department sign on
the tiled wall

The beam from his flashlight sweeps across the walls and the
piping bringing to light in the distance-

THE BROWNISH DAMP-SPOT

BEN
(to himself)
Damn What is happening to me

The moisture has pearled into droplets Slowly his hand comes
closer The wall crumbles at the slightest touch

Pushed by curiosity Ben begins to dig a hole in the plaster
just as he had done in his nightmare

He hears the echoing sound of streaming water coming from the
other side of the wall It confirms the existence of a hidden
room

Ben begins to dig frenetically in the saturated wall creating a
large enough opening to access the other side-

He inspects the interior with his flashlight revealing-

THE BRICK ROOM AND IN THE MIDDLE THE OCTAGONAL ROOM SURROUNDED
BY THE MIRRORING WALLS

He enters His image is reflected in all directions and
multiplied into infinity His dream was foreboding Everything
is perfectly identical to the nightmare with the exception of
Gary Lewis-

The former watchman is not there but

ALL OF A SUDDEN BEHIND HIM ONE OF BENS DUPLICATES IN THE
INFINITE REFLECTION TURNS AROUND TO OBSERVE HIM WITH AN ICE COLD
GLARE

Sensing something wrong Ben turns around

In the silence he faces his infinite reflections all of them
identical- OR ALMOST

Taking a closer look Ben notices one of the duplicates faces
bearing an expression slightly different from the others A
SUBTLE GRIN

Knowing that it has been noticed by Ben the rebel duplicate
turns his face towards Ben eyeing him with an evil gaze-

We can hardly recognize Bens image

The duplicate takes a step forward from the line of the other
reflections and slowly walks towards Ben

Instinctively Ben closes his eyes in an attempt to make the
vision disappear

When he opens up his eyes again-
HIS EVIL DOUBLE RUSHES TOWARDS HIM-

Ben steps back terrified

CUT TO

INT DAY- CORONERS OFFICE

Under the dazzling neon light of the NYPD coroners premises
Amy is in full swing submitting her conclusions on a homicide to
the police inspectors in charge of the investigation

She is interrupted by somebody who enters the room- There is
someone for her at the reception who insists on seeing her
55A
55A

55A

urgently Amy excuses herself removes her examination gloves
and exits the autopsy room

We follow her down the corridors as she passes men in police
uniforms and doctors in white coats in the endless comings and
goings between the police station and the hospital

The atmosphere here is highly charged reflecting the excessive
activity of this particular department There is no doubt- we
are in New York City

CORONERS OFFICE LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

Amy comes to the reception desk Ben who clearly hasnt slept
since the night before is pacing back and forth

AMY
Are you OK Whats happening What are
you doing here

BEN
Amy I need you to do me a favor

55A

AMY
Listen I am in the middle of work I
dont really have time now

BEN

I need your help It wont take more
than twenty minutes Please Amy

From his pocket Ben takes out Garys drivers license He shows
it to her-

BEN (CONTD)
You picked up this guy yesterday
morning I need to take a look at him
Its very important

AMY
Why do you want to see him
BEN
He used to work at the Mayflower as a

night watchman before I replaced him

AMY
Where did you get his drivers
license

BEN
I found his wallet in the department
store I need to find out how he
died

AMY
You are no longer a cop Ben This
isnt your business anymore

BEN
He sent me a package before he died
with newspaper articles about the

Mayflower I think he was trying to
tell me something I dont know him
Ive never even met him Amy I need

to figure this out

INT DAY - MORGUE

The refrigerated compartment bays

aligned along the basement walls

containing the corpses

are

A young doctor escorts Ben and Amy down the corridors of the

morgue As he is walking

in search of a name

YOUNG DOCTOR

Gary Lewis Gary Lewis Oh there he

is 58B He slashed his throat

the doctor flips through the register

AMY
(to Ben)
There you go Theres your answer
Your man committed suicide

BEN
You know a lot of people who cut their
own throats

YOUNG DOCTOR

(interrupting)
Well all I know is that the cops are
still investigating this one Thats
why we still have the body People can
be very creative when it comes to
suicide Im sure its not the
craziest thing youve seen

The young doctor stops in front of the number 58B He opens the
door to the refrigerated compartment bay and pulls out the tray
carrying the corpse wrapped in a white sheet-—

YOUNG DOCTOR (CONTD)
Gary Lewis

He lifts the sheet revealing Gary Lewis upper body-
Garys eyes are rolled upwards and his throat is wide open His
skin has become translucent almost purple His contorted corpse

is frozen in a deadly expression of profound suffering His
flesh has started to decompose and putrefy

Ben stares at the body in search of a hint a clue any useful
information

Amy becomes impatient

AMY
Ive got to get back to work Ben
Theyre waiting for me upstairs

BEN
How What did he slit his throat with

The doctor checks the report

YOUNG DOCTOR
With with a piece of mirror

Ben looks up 56

YOUNG DOCTOR (CONTD)
He must have smashed it into pieces
to have something to slash it with

The doctor has a smirk on his face-

YOUNG DOCTOR (CONTD)
Seven years of bad luck

Suddenly reflected in the stainless-steel door of the
compartment bay Ben sees-

GARYS FACE TURN SLOWLY TOWARDS HIM GARY STARES DIRECTLY AT
HIM WITH A VOICE FROM BEYOND HE DELIVERS A MESSAGE TO BEN-

GARY
ESSSEKERRR

Ben jumps out of his skin and backs away terrified Neither Amy
nor the doctor saw anything of course They gaze at him with a
puzzled look-

AMY
Are you OK Ben Whats going on

Ben looks at the corpse and its reflection again- Gary is frozen
in the same contorted position as if nothing ever happened

BEN
(coming to his senses)
I need to see his files

AMY
What

Ben raises his voice

BEN
I NEED TO SEE HIS FILES

AMY
Come on Ben what is it youre after
I am not supposed to show you any

file Youre not even allowed to be
here I could get fired for this

The doctor senses that the conversation is taking on a more
personal turn

YOUNG DOCTOR
Well Ill be off Amy you know where
to find me if you need me

Amy is left alone with Ben 56
AMY
What is happening to you What is all
this supposed to mean What is going
on Ben
BEN
I wont leave until I see that file
CUT TO
INT DAY -AMYS OFFICE 57

On the shelves photographs of Michael and Daisy stand next to
the medical records and legal-medicine textbooks

Sitting behind Amys desk Ben is studying Gary Lewis file He
flips back and forth through the different documents
photographs and police reports

Amy observes him perplexed We sense that she is concerned
about Bens strange behavior and over sensitivity

BEN
Look at this picture Come and see
Amy

He shows her a snapshot taken by the police We see Gary soaked
in his own blood the throat slit open The picture is real
crude He lies outstretched facing a mirror shattered into
several pointy pieces like a spider web In his hand Gary

still holds the piece of glass that he used to cut himself

Ben points

BEN (CONTD)
Look

What
to the reflection in the mirror-

BEN
Look at the piece of mirror in his
hand In the reflection of the mirror
its covered in blood and look- in
reality its clean Not a drop of
blood

So what

BEN
Dont you find it strange that this
mirror doesnt reflect an exact image
of reality

AMY
I cant see the difference It must be
an effect of the angle from which the
photograph was taken What is it you
are you trying to prove

BEN
What if the mirrors were showing us
something different

AMY

What For Christs sake listen to
yourself Ben What are you talking
about

BEN
What if the mirrors were reflecting
something that goes beyond reality

AMY
(irritated)
OK This is way over my head I dont
have time for your barfly theories

Ben realizes that he will not succeed in convincing her Not
today

BEN
Thanks for your help

Hes on his way out when she holds him back-

AMY
You should go home and get some rest
This guy probably just killed himself
because he couldnt live with himself
anymore It happens to thousands of
people you know

CUT TO

58 INT DAY - APARTMENT QUEENS - BATHROOM

The steam has fogged up the mirror of the medicine cabinet
Ben grabs a towel and steps out of the shower
He watches his blurry reflection With his finger on the
surface of the fogged mirror he writes-
ESSEKER
He contemplates the dripping letters for a long moment trying
to interpret their meaning

58

In the end he wipes off the mirror with his hand erasing the
word

Angela is standing behind him in the door opening-

ANGELA

Im off Amy called me today shes
worried about you Whats happening
Ben

BEN

Please not you

ANGELA
m your sister you can talk to me
s it your new job That place the
Mayflower has bad vibes Its getting
under your skin Just think about what

BEN

walk out on them like that I need
this job I need the money Im not
going to sleep on your couch for the
rest of my life

ANGELA
You wont have any trouble finding
another one A daytime job a regular
job

While shes talking we see the scene from another point of view-
from inside the mirror- As if SOMEONE ELSE WAS LISTENING TO
THEM

Angela leaves the bathroom Ben brushes his teeth He leans over
to rinse his mouth and when he straightens up-

IT IS NOT HIM IN THE REFLECTION OF THE MIRROR BUT GARY LEWIS
WHO SLASHES HIS THROAT FROM END TO END WITH A SHARP PIECE OF
MIRROR-

Ben steps back and loses his balance knocking down a shelf
Angela rushes into the bathroom-

ANGELA (CONTD)
What happened Ben Are you all right

He refuses her help

BEN
LEAVE ME ALONE

Ben gets to his feet and looks into the mirror His reflection
is back Everything looks normal but- 58
WHEN HE TURNS TO EXIT THE BATHROOM HIS REFLECTION STAYS STILL

WATCHING HIM

CUT TO

EXT DAY- GARY LEWIS BUILDING 59
The sun sets behind the Harlem skyline

Bens Oldsmobile pulls over in the street- He has decided to
pass by Gary Lewis old house before his nightshift

He presses the doorbell next to Gary Lewis name An old lady
answers-

BEN
Mrs Lewis Sorry to bother you My
name is Ben Carson I worked with
Gary at Mayflower Could I come up
and talk to you for a few minutes

Silence

BEN (CONTD)

INT DAY- MRS LEWIS APARTMENT 60

MRS LEWIS is at least 80 years old and almost blind behind her
thick glasses She lives alone in the small apartment that she
used to share with her grandson

We sense that she is distraught by Garys death

MRS LEWIS
-My Gary hadnt slept at home for

three weeks At first I figured he had
found himself a girlfriend so I

didnt worry much about it Its
terrible The policeman told me that
he was living in the streets They

found his body in the subway Why He
had everything he needed here Every
morning I would have his breakfast
ready when hed come home from work

BEN
Did he use any drugs

MRS LEWIS
Gary Huh-huh Never He was a good
boy

BEN

Did you notice anything different the
days prior to his leaving the house
anything unusual in his behavior

MRS LEWIS
Oh yes but that goes way back to when
he started working at Mayflower

BEN
What kind of changes

MRS LEWIS
He didnt care much for anything
anymore Before wed sit up and watch
television together But once he
started that job as a night watchman
hed spend all his time-off locked up
in his room

BEN
Sleeping
MRS LEWIS
He hardly slept anymore He was way

too busy
BEN
Busy doing what

MRS LEWIS
That I dont know I never knew what
he was up to

She reaches for a picture frame on the chest

MRS LEWIS (CONTD)
Look in this picture he was twelve
years old

BEN
Is that you standing next to him

MRS LEWIS
Yes back in the days

BEN
Mrs Lewis I found a note that Gary
wrote
(MORE)

60 60

BEN (CONTD)
A piece of paper where hed scribbled
down the name Esseker Does that mean
anything to you

MRS LEWIS
Esseker is that what youre saying

The old lady dwells on it for a moment-

MRS LEWIS (CONTD)
No that dont mean a thing to me

She sets down the picture frame

BEN
May I see his room

MRS LEWIS
Yes of course Come follow me its
down the hallway the door at the very
end

Ben follows Mrs Lewis to her grandsons room-

It looks nothing like the room of a fifty-year-old man but
rather like that of an old teenager From what we can see Gary
grew up in here and each object recalls a stage in his life
Everything is clean and in its proper place it is perfectly
tidy

BEN
Do you mind if I stay in here fora
moment

Mrs Lewis smiles at him She too likes to gather her thoughts
in Garys room

Ben scrutinizes the room in search of a clue a hint that might
help him on the Esseker lead He opens the drawers and looks
through the papers-—

Nothing is of any help to him The only place left that he
hasnt searched is the walk-in closet whose half-open doors
seem to invite him to enter

What Ben discovers inside is beyond anything he could ever have
imagined- The closet has been emptied out completely and
MIRRORS COVER EACH AND EVERY WALL FROM THE FLOOR TO THE
CEILING - Its a miniature replica of the hidden room that Ben
discovered back in the basement of the department store

MRS LEWIS
He would spend hours looking at
himself

Mrs Lewis steps up behind him- 60

MRS LEWIS (CONTD)

To look at oneself too much is a sin
A terrible sin Do you know sir in the

INT NIGHT - MAYFLOWER 61
Night has fallen The department store is calm and silent

We move down each floor to the entrance hall The basement door
is open and in the darkness we see the gleam of the

flashlight Ben must be down there

ALL OF A SUDDEN A LOUD SHRIEK TEARS THROUGH THE SILENCE There
is a woman somewhere in the store

Ben runs up to the entrance hall at full speed The shrieks
resound through the department store again They seem to come
from one of the floors above

Without hesitation Ben dashes up the stairs-

He arrives on the second floor and searches through all the
departments Impossible to tell where the cries originate from

He climbs up to the third floor The beam of the flashlight
sweeps past each nook and dark corner-

Somewhere in the store the woman continues to scream and wail
to death

BEN
(shouting)

WHERE ARE YOU
No answer Ben goes up to the fourth floor The shrieks are
heard again but this time coming from one of the floors below
Ben dashes for the Ladies department-

BEN (CONTD)

STAY CALM IM COMING

INT NIGHT - LADIES DEPARTMENT DRESSING ROOMS

The screams come closer Ben passes the counters and enters the
dressing rooms - or rather what is left of them since the fire

The woman must be in here hiding somewhere

61A

BEN
Im here Maam

Short of breath Ben inspects the dressing rooms with his
flashlight

The woman seems to have vanished

BEN (CONTD)
Maam Im right he

ANOTHER SHRIEK IS EMITTED RIGHT NEXT TO HIM He turns around-
No one there

About to leave the dressing rooms Ben catches sight of a
mirror In the reflection he sees the row of empty rooms-

A BLOODY HAND BURSTS OUT FROM THE LAST ONE ACCOMPANIED BY
ANOTHER PIERCING SCREECH OF PAIN

Ben runs to it but finds it empty IN THE REFLECTION OF THE
MIRROR HOWEVER THE HAND IS STILL STRETCHED OUT TOWARDS HIM

Ben stops to think- If he can somehow move the mirror to have it
face the last booth he might be able to see what truly happened
inside

Ben unhooks the mirror

t is way too heavy and bulky to carry He lets it slide down
the wall

nch by inch Ben hauls the mirror across the floor

He reaches the last dressing room-
Through the reflection in the mirror he examines the interior
of the cubicle

n the dark he catches sight of BARE FEET STAMPING AGAINST THE
TILED FLOOR The torn half-burnt curtains conceal the rest of
the body

With his eyes fixed on the mirror Ben walks backward towards
the dressing room He is scared of what he is about to discover
He gives the curtain a quick yank revealing-
A NAKED YOUNG WOMAN IS GOING INTO SPASMS AND SCREECHING WITH
PAIN DESPITE THE ABSENCE OF REAL FLAMES HER SKIN AND FLESH ARE
ROASTING AS IF SHE WERE BURNING ALIVE FROM THE INSIDE OUT

Ben secures the padlock of the department store entrance

He walks towards the trailer while keeping a fixed eye on the
facade of the building The scene he just witnessed in the
dressing rooms has shaken him up

He goes inside Through one of the windows we see him pick up
the phone and dial a number-

INT NIGHT - APARTMENT QUEENS INTERCUT INT NIGHT - LODGE 65

Angela is in the bathroom when the phone starts ringing She
turns on the tap of the cast-iron bathtub and goes to answer

ANGELA

BEN (0S)
Yeah sure See you later Angie

ANGELA
Be careful Love you

BEN
Love you too sis

She hangs up the receiver and stays in the dark for a moment
concerned

The sound of the pouring bath brings her back to reality

We follow her into the bathroom She dips her fingers into the
water to check the temperature The bathtub is almost full

Angela undresses in front of the medicine cabinet mirror When
she turns around to climb into the hot bath HER REFLECTION
REMAINS MOTIONLESS IN THE MIRROR STARING BLANKLY AT EACH OF HER
MOVEMENTS

Unaware Angela soaks into her hot bath

The water continues to pour from the tap

Angela shuts her eyes- Its been a long day

IN THE MIRROR ANGELAS REFLECTION FIXES HER WITH A COLD GLARE-

Without a word Angelas reflection brings its hands to its face
and digs its fingers into its mouth In a sudden jerk it pulls
open its jaw-

AS IF SHE WERE ELECTROCUTED ANGELAS BODY CONTORTS VIOLENTLY

WRENCHING IT WIDE OPEN

SUDDENLY RIPPING ITS JAW OFF WITH THE SOUND OF CRACKING BONES
AND CARTILAGE-

AT THE SAME INSTANT IN THE BATHTUB ANGELA HAS NO TIME TO REACT
BEFORE SHE UNDERGOES THE SAME AGONIZING TORTURE

The mirror cracks by itself

The bathtub overflows with red water spilling out on the white
tiled bathroom floor

FADE TO BLACK

INT DAY - APARTMENT QUEENS - THE NEXT MORNING

The camera flashes illuminate the crime scene

Angelas body lies afloat in the bathtub The apartment is
entirely flooded

Two men in police uniforms close off a security zone to keep
the intrusive neighbors away

A detective is interrogating an old Puerto Rican couple- the
downstairs neighbors They were the ones who alerted the police
after having noticed the water leakage The old woman explains
how it was raining blood into her living room

Amongst the police officers and the legal medical squad we find
Larry He is in charge of the case

Leaning over the bathtub Larry examines the visible parts of
the corpse Angelas face is concealed by her own long black
hair floating in the murky water

Larry slips on an examination glove pulls up his sleeve and
sinks his arm into the blood-red bath He feels around for the
chain of the plug in order to drain the bathtub

The water level begins to recede gradually revealing Angelas
naked corpse

With the tip of his fingers Larry lifts away the few strands of
hair covering Angelas face-

Taken by surprise he steps back from the horrifying sight of
this JAW-LESS FACE

Larry removes his glove wipes off his bloodied arm and starts
to leave the bathroom when something else catches his attention-

He comes closer to the spiderweb cracked medicine cabinet
mirror A TINY DROP OF BLOOD is dripping from one of the cracks

Strange

A DARK SILHOUETTE PASSES BEHIND HIM IN THE REFLECTION He turns
immediately- The bloodied bathroom is still and silent Angelas
destroyed body lies in the empty bathtub

A police inspector in the next room calls out to him-

POLICE INSPECTOR OS
Larry Take a look at this

LARRY
What is it

POLICE INSPECTOR OS
Come take a look for yourself

Larry exits the bathroom The police inspector in the living
room holds a picture frame in his hands He turns towards Larry-

POLICE INSPECTOR
Look Isnt Ben Carson in the picture

INT DAY - POLICE STATION - INTERROGATION ROOM

Still wearing his uniform Ben is sitting alone in one of the
interrogation rooms of the police station His haggard face
expresses great grief His sisters death has left him
distraught

He fiddles with an empty plastic cup in his hands

The classic two-way mirror facing him throws back his
reflection

Ben knows that he is being watched

Behind the two-way mirror Amy observes him Larry is standing
next to her

LARRY
The water has obliterated most of the
marks No trace of struggle or broken

entry the entrance door was locked

LARRY (CONTD)
The person who did this must have had
the keys to her apartment or
otherwise it was somebody she knew

AMY
He would never have laid a finger on
her When their father died Ben took
care of his sister Angela meant the
world to him

LARRY
Listen so far his statement is
pretty consistent with the facts We

checked it out he did place a call
from work at 1230 and the womans
downstairs neighbors claim they
started noticing the water leakage at
around two in the morning The daytime
security guard Lorenzo Sappeli
confirms he came on after Bens shift
at seven am The only strange thing
and it may just be a coincidence is
that Ben told Sappeli that he had
decided to quit his job as if he was
planning to go away somewhere Did he
mention anything about it to you

AMY
No lately communication hasnt quite
been our strong point
(she smiles)
I only found out yesterday that he was
staying at his sisters What are you
going to do with him

LARRY
I figure well let him go At this
point we havent got any real reason
to keep him here And I think hes
had his share for the day

AMY
You know whats gonna happen if you
let him go He wont stop here I know
him he wont stop until he finds who
did this to her

LARRY
Listen where we stand now we got
nothing not a single clue Im sure
he can help us

AMY
What kind of friend are you You are
using him Hes not a cop anymore

LARRY
Hes still the best one I know even
if hes one of the suspects

Amy comes closer to the two-way mirror She looks at her

ex-

confusion

She can see the distress in his eyes

Try to keep an eye on him

Ben walks away leaving Amy alone on the steps of the police
station

AMY
Ben wait

Ben does not turn around The rain is beating down harder and
the thunder grumbles in the distance The first lightning
flashes light up the sky

Another flash-

- QUEENS APARTMENT -

Ben ignores the crime scenes restriction perimeter and enters
Angelas apartment Without turning on the light he goes
straight for a leather pouch stashed among his cardboard boxes

Inside- A 357 MAGNUM his former cop weapon

Another flash-

Having found a weak spot
suddenly

opens fire-

Ben savors his sweet victory when
something inconceivable unfolds before his very eyes-

THE BULLET IMPACTS DISSOLVE AS IF BY MAGIC AND THE MIRRORS ARE

RECONSTITUTED

Bens shock and disbelief give way to rage He fires ina fury
emptying the entire clip this time-

Again the bullet holes vanish leaving Ben alone face to face
with his own reflection He breaks down nervously-

BEN
Why did you do it WHY WHY DID YOU
HAVE TO KILL HER

Silence

BEN (CONTD)
What is it you want What do you want
from me ANSWER ME WHAT IS IT YOU
WANT

Suddenly one after the other letters start appearing in one
of the mirrors as if an invisible finger were tracing them in
the dust-

REKESSE

Ben turns around and in the reflection of the opposite mirror
he recognizes the inverted word- the same word he found on the
note in Garys wallet the word Ben himself had traced in his
bathroom mirror-

ESSEKER
CUT TO

INT NIGHT -QUEENS APARTMENT

Back in the Queens apartment Ben still hasnt gotten any sleep
On the wall he is assembling all the newspaper clippings
articles and photographs that Gary sent him

Each and every mirror in Angelas apartment has been covered
with sheets blankets old rags- anything he could find to
neutralize the reflective surfaces

With the phone cradled between his ear and shoulder he is in the
middle of a heated conversation-

BEN
Look up Esseker Yes Echo Sierra
Sierra Echo Kilo Echo Romeo
Esseker No idea my guess is that
its a name No I havent got a first
name Yes in New York Over the past
five or six years I know its hazy
but thats all Ive got I already
looked it up in the phone book I also
called someone at the IRS and at the
DMV but nothing there Its very
important Larry Youll call me back
Ok

Ben hangs up the phone and remains in front of the wall covered
with clippings for a moment Now he can have a clear overview of

Garys investigative research

All the articles date back approximately to the same period and
are all related to the fire that ravaged Mayflower five years
ago

But not a hint of Esseker

Ben studies the newspaper clippings trying to piece the story
together-

Deadly Fire at Mayflower- 29 dead and 78 wounded

Brutal Massacre- Mother and her three daughters
slaughtered

the children drowned in the bathtub

the throat slit open

Mayflowers security guard taken in for questioning

72 72

The night watchman confesses to setting the fire but firmly
denies the accusation of murdering his family

Terrence Berry confesses but claims the mirrors are guilty-
The security guard at Mayflower finally confesses He started
the fire in the department store with the intention of
destroying the mirrors responsible according to him for the
death of his wife and three daughters

Ben observes Terrence Berrys face in one of the archive
photographs He looks like a perfectly normal guy rather kind
surely he was a good father Ben cant help but empathize with
him

As he looks up Ben catches a glimpse of his reflection in the
window-

What if he too lost his mind and went on to slaughter his
family Or what if the mirrors would do it

The phone rings-

BEN (CONTD)
Yes so whatd you find out Nothing
under that name Shit shit shit
shit Can you look up Berry Terrence
Berry

Ben holds on the line for a moment

BEN (CONTD)
Got anything GreatNo I already
know all that Is he still alive No
Can you find out where he was
committed before his death Wait Im
writing it down

Ben sits down on the bed and scribbles down the address on a
piece of paper

BEN (CONTD)
Roosevelt Psychiatric Detention
Center Yeah I know where it is
Thanks

He hangs up the phone Under the blanket next to him he spots
the T-shirt that his sister was wearing the other night

The pain is too strong He cannot hold back his tears anymore
and starts crying

INT DAY -NEW JERSEY HOUSE - KITCHEN 73
The next morning -

Heavy-eyed and sleepy Michael is hypnotized in front of the
weather forecast on TV

The hot chocolate set in front of him is getting cold His
sister Daisy pours herself some more orange juice Amy shaking
a box of cereal interrupts the little boy in his dream state-

AMY
Do you want the cereal in your hot
chocolate or in a separate bowl

The little boy does not answer

AMY (CONTD)
Michael

MICHAEL
In the chocolate

AMY
In the chocolate please mom

MICHAEL
(repeating after her)

Please mom

She pours the cereal in his hot chocolate

DAISY
Yuck thats gross how can you eat
that

AMY

Come on come on lets get going or
youre going to be late for school

Michael begins to eat his breakfast his gaze still fixed on the
weathermans forecast on TV As Amy fills the cats bowl with
pellets Tiger rushes over to join the rest of the family
DAISY
Mom

AMY
What is it sweetheart

DAISY
Do you know that Michael has a new
friend

73

MICHAEL

No thats not true

AMY
Really whats his name

MICHAEL
(to his sister)
You promised not to tell

AMY
Does he go to your school

Michael doesnt answer Daisy shakes her head

AMY (CONTD)
(pretending to be
indifferent)
Very well If you dont want to tell
me about it

The little boy stays quiet

MICHAEL
He doesnt want me to talk about him

Amy suddenly becomes more concerned and sits down next to
Michael-

AMY
Why doesnt he want you to talk about
him Is he a grown up
MICHAEL
No

AMY
So hes a little boy your age then

Michael gives a reluctant nod Amy is reassured He finishes his
mug of cereal and goes to place it in the sink Amy gives Daisy
a questioning look-

AMY (CONTD)
(to Michael)
Does he live in our street Is it one
of our neighbors

Michael remains silent and Daisy answers for him-

DAISY
He lives in the mirror in our room

Daisy bursts out laughing Michael glares back at her furious

Puzzled Amy reflects briefly on Daisys remark-

73 73

AMY
Is it your father who told you that

Michael remains silent

AMY (CONTD)
Michael answer me Did your father
talk to you about the mirrors

MICHAEL
No Mommy

Amy questions him with her eyes Michael lowers his

AMY
OK Come on come on guys lets get
our teeth brushed and our coats on
The first one in the car is the
winner

The two kids dash up the stairs Amy is left alone to clean up
breakfast

She casts a glance at the front hall mirror Daisys comment
lingers in her thoughts

Dressed in their coats Michael and Daisy come running down the
stairs and rush out of the house Amy exits the house The car
drives away

Daisys cat leaps onto the kitchen table and directs his gaze to
the mirror-

FOR NO APPARENT REASON THE CAT SUDDENLY STIFFENS INTO A
POSITION OF DEFENSE HE BRISTLES HIS COAT AND HISSES AND SPITS
TOWARDS HIS REFLECTION IN THE MIRROR

Wide shot- The high security psychiatric hospital stands under a
leaden sky -

DR MORRIS (VO)
You know Mr Carson when one starts
to perceive ones own reflection as a
completely separate being one is
suddenly confronted with two entirely
separate egos two entirely separate
worlds that can surface at any given
moment—

INT DAY - ROOSEVELT PSYCHIATRIC DETENTION CENTER 75

DR MORRIS the doctor who had once been in charge of Terrence
Berry escorts Ben down the corridor-

DR MORRIS
A feeling of self-hatred generally
triggered by a psychological shock can
split the personality in two hence
creating two or more personalities
with distinct memories or behavior
patterns within the same individual

The patient then has a faulty
perception of the existence of two
distinct worlds which are principally
the real word and the world inside
the mirror

The two men pass a number of guards and security check-points as
they head down towards the hospitals film and video archive-

BEN
Did you consider Terrence innocent

Dr Morris swipes his magnetic card through the electronic
device unlocking the door to the archives

DR MORRIS
In my opinion he was convinced that
he was telling the truth when he
claimed he didnt kill his family I
too am convinced that when it
happened Terrence was not himself
but rather his double his mirror
image one might say

He enters the archives followed by Ben-

INT DAY - ARCHIVES- ROOSEVELT PSYCHIATRIC DETENTION CENTER 76

Dr Morris finger glides across several DV-tapes dated 2001 in
search of one particular tape-

DR MORRIS
These recordings are from Terrences
trial You will find that they speak
for themselves

He pushes the tape into the deck A grainy picture appears on
the screen-

We discover TERRENCE BERRY sitting behind a desk His hands are
cuffed Facing him DR MORRIS is leading the cross-examination

76

Terrence is tense and uncomfortable He keeps his face down
never looking into the camera
DESPITE HAVING SURVIVED THE FIRE TERRENCES FACE IS NONETHELESS
DISFIGURED BY THIRD DEGREE BURNS HE NO LONGER HAS FACIAL
FEATURES AND HE STRUGGLES WITH HIS SPEECH

DR MORRIS (CONTD)
Why did you set the department store
on fire

TERRENCE
In order to to destroy the mirrors
Only fire can destroy a mirror isnt
that right Doctor

DR MORRIS
What made you think you absolutely had
to destroy those mirrors Terrence

Terrence remains silent Dr Morris repeats his question-
DR MORRIS (CONTD)

What made you want to destroy those
mirrors Terrence

TERRENCE
They killed Helen and my three little
girls

DR MORRIS

For what reason Why would mirrors
want to kill your family

TERRENCE
Because I didnt

Terrence breaks out in tears

DR MORRIS
Didnt do what

With his eyes fixed on the video monitor deep inside Ben
already knows the answer that Terrence is about to give

TERRENCE
They asked me to find Esseker Like
they did with the others

DR MORRIS
Who are the others youre talking

about

TERRENCE
I wasnt the first one they asked 76

DR MORRIS
And what happened

TERRENCE
I didnt succeed I didnt succeed in
finding Esseker

Ben realizes that hes in the exact same situation-

BEN
Amy
(to Dr Morris)
I have to go

He stands to leave The monitor keeps playing the old footage-

DR MORRIS
Tell me about Esseker Terrence

Terrence doesnt speak

DR MORRIS (CONTD)
Who is Esseker Terrence

Suddenly Terrences behavior shifts to another extreme He
stands up and flying into a rage he becomes brutal and
hysterical-

TERRENCE
I DONT KNOW WHO ESSEKER IS I DONT
KNOW WHO ESSEKER IS I DONT KNOW

Terrence becomes uncontrollable He wrecks the folders lying on
the desk and throws himself head first against a wall mirror
that shatters to pieces

He is beside himself After seeing the video footage on
Terrence he has been struck with fear and panic for his family-

Before the perplexed gaze of Rosa and his children Ben
agitatedly comes and goes in the hallway of the second floor He
is removing the mirrors from each and every room

He tears away the bathroom mirror unhooks the one in the far
end of the hallway and removes some from Amys room

Rosa fears more and more for the children and takes them under
her protective arms Amy is not back yet

The only mirror left that Ben cannot remove is the one in the
childrens room

He rushes down to the basement and comes back with a bucket of
old paint He immediately begins to paint the wall mirror in
order to neutralize its reflection

DAISY
What are you doing dad

BEN
Dont worry theres nothing wrong
Everything is OK

DAISY
But why are you doing that

Ben can see that she is very upset about the situation

Ben pulls his Magnum out of his belt and points the gun at one
of the mirrors he has dragged outside

Amy steps back terrified-

Without a moments hesitation Ben opens fire The mirror
shatters to pieces-

COMPLETELY MAD

Ben smiles all excited-

BEN
Wait look youll see

Through the front window Daisy and Michael witness the scene-

AMY
SEE WHAT BEN WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO
SEE

Ben keeps a piercing gaze as the bullet impacts the mirror
waiting for the magic to do its trick and for the cracks to
dissolve again-

BUT NOTHING HAPPENS THE CRACKS REMAIN IN A SPIDER WEB PATTERN

Behind the front door Ben notices Michael watching him in
tears

Without any evidence Ben is in over his head

BEN
But I swear to you I I sawAmy

The neighbors alerted by the blast of the gun come out of
their houses to find out what has happened

Ben stands alone looking like a mad man
Amy holds back her tears and tries to stay in control-

AMY
Get outnow I dont ever want to see
you here again Ben And Ill have the
lawyers make sure the same goes for
the kids You are insane Ben and

dangerous Youve got to get help

With gun in hand Ben walks away dismayed as he gradually
becomes aware of the situation he has just created

He enters his car and drives off at top speed

EXTINT DAY - ROAD - BENS CAR

Ben drives nervously He feels guilty about his conduct in front
of the children A thousand thoughts rush through his head
leaving him in an utter state of confusion He doesnt know what
to do nor what to think anymore

Ben reaches for his cell phone and dials Larrys number-

BEN
Hello Larry Its me Im going to
need your help again-

LARRY (0S)
Come on Ben For Christs sake What
are you doing

BEN
Mayflower used to be a hospital before
it became a department store St
Johns Hospital Do you have any idea
where all the medical records could
have ended up after it closed down

LARRY (0S)
How am I supposed to know that

BEN
Go to the city hall archives They
must have something considering it was
a public hospital

LARRY (0S)

go to City Hall today Ive -

BEN
Larry Larry stop it If I could go
myself I wouldnt be asking you Go

trying to prove

BEN
Please do it for me

LARRY (0S)

Ben hangs up

He glances back at the rear view mirror and sees ANGELAS
CORPSE SITTING ON THE BACK SEAT

Startled he loses control of the vehicle A truck approaches at
full speed in the opposite lane He barely avoids the collision

Two other cars appear Ben zigzags in and out just barely
avoiding a fatal crash

He stops along the edge of the road
Ben closes his eyes and rests his head against the steering
wheel in an attempt to clear his mind He looks up into the rear-

view mirror again-

ANGELAS REFLECTION IS STILL THERE Behind her long black hair
she fixes him with a milky gaze

Ben flies into a rage HE SMASHES THE REAR-VIEW MIRROR WITH HIS
BARE FIST REDUCING IT TO SCRAPS

Ben is alone and lost

understand What have I done

Under the pouring rain the police patrol cars come and go in
front of the police station

A bit further away we recognize Bens Oldsmobile parked on an
adjacent street Ben is waiting inside

A man approaches knocks on the car window and enters the
vehicle Its LARRY-

The rainwater drips down his raincoat Under his arm he holds a
file of documents wrapped in a plastic bag

LARRY

This ought to make you happy
(handing him the file)
Anna Esseker

83 83

Ben nervously tears open the plastic wrapping-

LARRY (CONTD)
I wasnt quite sure what you needed
so I got all of her medical records

BEN
Perfect Larry Thats perfect

Ben skims through the pages He cannot believe that he has
finally discovered who Esseker is

LARRY
Everyones real edgy up there Youre
still a fuckin murder suspect

People are wondering why I let you
out You have to tell me more What
does the history of the Mayflower have
to do with the death of your sister

BEN
I dont know exactly I cant tell
you but some really fucked up things
started happening to me when I took
the job over there Nothing makes any
sense to me either but I have to
follow my instinct

Larry notices the broken rear-view mirror-

LARRY
What happened Did you have an
accident

Ben is too absorbed in the records He doesnt answer

BEN
Anna Esseker Where did you find her
files Did you go to City Hall

LARRY
No you were wrong about that they
had nothing All the medical records
from St Johns Hospital are still up
there with the unclassified cases

Ben squints at him
LARRY (CONTD)
She was a patient at St Johns in the
psych ward run by a Dr Kane between

March and September 1952 She was only
twelve years old when she died

Ben freezes-

83 83

BEN
What

LARRY
When the nurses went on their rounds
first thing on the morning of October
6th they discovered that all the
patients had left their rooms during
the night and gathered in the main
room All of them were dead including
the girl Apparently they had killed
one another A slaughter house After
that they shut down the place Nobody
ever found out what really happened

He was arrested They found him dead
on the first day of his hearing He
had slit his wrists with a piece of
his cell mirror

He walks through the lobby of his building

OMITTED

INT NIGHT - QUEENS APARTMENT

Angelas apartment is plunged in total darkness-

Ben lays Anna Essekers file on the coffee table and aims the
desk lamp at his research corner on the wall

He turns the lamp back at the file and sits down to study it

WHY ARE THE MIRRORS ASKING FOR ANNA IF SHES ALREADY DEAD WHY
IT DOESNT MAKE ANY SENSE

On an index card filled in by Annas parents in September 1952
Ben finds a Pennsylvania home address
Dr Kanes first diagnosis is irrevocable - Despite her young
age Anna Esseker suffers from severe schizophrenia leading to
withdrawal from reality delusional and violent behavior

He shuffles through the first few pages of various
administrative documents

His eye lands on several photographs of Anna taken at the time
she was admitted to the hospital- She is just a child yet six
male nurses were needed to restrain and immobilize her in front
of the photographer Her face is hardly discernible as she
struggles like a wild animal

A high-pitched sound of cracking glass is heard from behind Ben
turns around-

Another loud crack - It comes from one of the covered mirrors in
the apartment

Ben rises slowly to his feet and comes closer He removes the
sheet hanging on the frame-

A crack has appeared in the upper corner of the mirror Ben
casts his eyes over the reflection His glance comes to rest on
Annas file laying on the desk-

He goes to fetch the photograph of the little girl and presents
it to the mirror-

KRAAAAACK - the crack in the mirror spreads as if some kind of
pressure were applied on the other side of the mirror as a
reaction to the photograph

BEN
Youre still alive arent you

All of a sudden Ben realizes something He runs back to the
file on the table and goes through the documents again one by

one

He stops on a carbon copy of a hospital release form and checks

the date

BEN (CONTD)
Youre wrong Larry youre wrong

His eyes light up-

BEN (CONTD)
she left the hospital on the 4th

According to the document Anna left two days before the
massacre

She passes in front of the childrens room and stops- INSIDE

dashes

out of the room

Amys glance freezes in horror Terrified she almost loses her
balance-

SQUATTING POSITION

HE LOOKS AT AMY WITH A BIG SMILE

help he paints over all the mirrors in the house In the face of
this hardship all the arguments seem far away We can feel a
connection between the two of them

The windowpanes and picture frames have been wrapped securely
with newspaper and tape

Every inch of reflective surface in the house such as the TV-
screen and the shiny taps have been neutralized with strips
of masking tape
IN NO TIME THERE IS NOT A SINGLE SURFACE CAPABLE OF REFLECTING
LIGHT LEFT IN THE HOUSE

CUT TO

94 EXT DAY -NEW JERSEY HOUSE

The front door of the house opens On the landing of the front

steps Ben kisses Daisy goodbye

DAISY
When will you be back Dad

94 94

BEN
As quickly as I can sweetheart I
promise

He kisses Michael who hugs him back-

MICHAEL
I love you Dad

He strokes Michael gently on the head and goes to his car Daisy
and Michael watch their father leave

Amy walks him to the vehicle-

AMY
What if you dont find her Maybe she
doesnt live there anymore Maybe
shes really dead

BEN
They want her Im gonna find her
wherever she is We dont have any
other choice

Ben holds her tightly in his arms and plants a tender kiss on
her forehead
BEN (CONTD)
Im sorry about everything Ive put
you through I didnt want to

Amy interrupts him

I know
Ben gets into the car

BEN
Amy I want you to stay here with the
kids until all this is over All the
mirrors are covered theres no more
danger Ill come back as soon as I
can

Tears well up in Amys eyes He takes her hand-
BEN (CONTD)
Hey baby everythings gonna be fine
I love you

She smiles tenderly Ben drives off

95 INT DAY - BENS CAR

Through the back window we see Amy in front of the house
growing more and more distant

Annas medical file lies open on the passenger seat- At the top

of the page we can read her old address in Pennsylvania

96 EXT DAY - ROAD

-Aerial shot-
We fly over a lake- the waters are so placid that the forest and
outline of the scenery surrounding it reflect off its surface

creating two perfectly symmetrical landscapes

We glide over the treetops diving deeper into the forest to
follow the main road that zigzags along the slope of the hill

DISSOLVE TO

98 INT DAY -BENS CAR

A sign on the edge of the road indicates 67 miles to
Pennsylvania
Ben focuses on the road determined to put an end to what hides
behind the mirrors and to rescue his family
98A OMITTED
98A
99 EXT DAY - COUNTRY ROAD

Bens car slows down as he reaches a dirt road
On one of the mailboxes standing on the edge of the road he
spots the name Esseker-
100 EXT DAY - ESSEKER FARMHOUSE

The wind blows over the land
In the winter season the muddy fields have little to offer to
the few starving crows flying over them A feeling of desolation
and solitude hangs over the deserted landscape
Bens car has left the asphalt road behind driving through the
countryside down a winding dirt road

100 100

An old farmhouse stands at the very end of the path If it
werent for the parked pick-up truck and the few piglets running
wild one would think that the farmhouse was abandoned
Ben gets out of the car and goes to knock on the door

His shoes sink into the mud He walks up the steps of the porch
and peeks inside the house through the front window In the dark
he discerns the silhouette of a person who is watching TV He
cant help but notice all the mirrors have been covered or
turned towards the wall

A big dog barks behind the window Ben steps back surprised

The front door opens before Ben has even made his presence
known A young man stares at him in silence

BEN
Hello Is this the Esseker farmhouse

The young man nods
A womans voice is heard from inside-

WOMANS VOICE
What is it Jimmy

JIMMY
I dont know Mom
(to Ben)
What can I do for you sir

BEN
I am looking for Anna Anna Esseker

The young man looks at Ben questioningly Apparently he has
never heard the name before

JIMMY
(to his mother inside)
Theres a man whos looking for
(back to Ben)
You said Anna
(Ben confirms)
Anna Esseker Mom

Jimmys mother in her fifties an obese woman who has trouble
moving around- shows up in the opening of the door -

JIMMYS MOTHER
What is it you want with Anna Esseker

She catches him unaware Ben makes up a false identity-

100 100

BEN
I huh I am doing some research for a
book on the history of St Johns
Hospital in New York

Jimmys mother stares at him for a moment with a suspicious

look-
JIMMYS MOTHER
Jimmy go tell grandpa that theres a
man here whod like to talk to him
about his sister
101 INT DAY - FARMHOUSE BASEMENT 101

We are in the dark basement under the farmhouse The door to
the first floor opens letting the light in Ben appears next to
the silhouette of an old man- ROBERT ESSEKER 80 years old
Annas elder brother

Robert walks down the steps signaling Ben to follow him-

ROBERT
You know up to this day the visions
of Annas fits still haunt me at
night

They walk through the basement towards an old wooden door

ROBERT (CONTD)
I helped my father fix up this part
of the basement especially for her-

The old man turns the key in the padlock Slowly the door
swings open revealing-

ROBERT (CONTD)
Her fits were too violent My mother
couldnt take her screams anymore

Whats left of a very primitive childs room SURROUNDED BY

DOUBLE WIRE FENCING AND IRON BARS
resembles a HUMAN-SIZED CAGE

FEROCIOUS BEAST

As hes talking

that time come back to him-

Anna being carried to the basement

Rather than a cell
CAPABLE OF RESISTING THE MOST

it more

images flash on screen- painful memories from

her innocent eyes full of

hate Its even hard to recognize the face of a little girl Her
howling screams Her nails digging into her own flesh Her
unnatural strength and the violent thrashing of her arms and

legs

ROBERT (CONTD)
We had every priest doctor healer
coming from all over the state one
after the other But no one could help
her

Ben comes closer to the iron bars of the cage He can see Annas

scratch marks next to the bed

her plight and suffering

ROBERT (CONTD)
Finally Dr Kane from New York
answered my parents cry for help He
rejected the idea of demonic
possession said he didnt believe in
it He was convinced that Anna
suffered from a rare form of
personality disorder He wanted Anna
under his care at St Johns My
parents were very poor but he agreed
to cover all the hospital costs In
less than five months Dr Kane had
cured Anna It was unbelievable She
was her old self again A real miracle
of science

BEN
And after the hospital

ROBERT

giving his imagination a taste of
You dont know She died there with
all of Kanes other patients

Ben takes the old release form out of his pocket and shows it to
Robert

BEN
Anna left the hospital two days before
the massacre Kane changed the records
to make her disappear

ROBERT
Youre not a journalist are you What
do you want

BEN
I want to know After St Johns
where did she go

Robert stares at Ben unsure of saying what hes about to reveal
to this perfect stranger-

ROBERT
Anna came back to live with us fora
while

101 101
BEN

For a while
Robert lowers his eyes

BEN (CONTD)
And after Why did she leave

ROBERT
Because Because strange things
started to happen in the house

BEN
With Anna

ROBERT
No not with Anna
The old man obviously doesnt want to get into the details The
memories are too painful

BEN
With the mirrors

Robert stiffens eyeing Ben with a dark look- How does he know

BEN (CONTD)
Mr Esseker tell me where I can find
your sister Its very important Its
a matter of life and death

Robert hesitates -

ROBERT
Before he died Kane sent us a letter
asking us to keep Anna away from
mirrors and that whatever happens she
should be in a place where the mirrors
could never find her

BEN
Where is she now

ROBERT
To protect us she left the house and
joined the monastic orders where
mirrors are forbidden St Augustines
monastery on the road to Midwich

102 EXT DAY - ESSEKER FARMHOUSE

Bens car does a one-eighty turn in front of the farmhouse
heading back to the main road

102

Standing on the porch with an anxious look on his face Robert
watches him disappear in the distance

He sits down on the steps and wipes his glasses
The crows fly low in the sky- Its a bad sign

cut TO

EXT DAY - MIDWICH MONASTERY

The nuns come and go under the arches of the monastic courtyard

A deadly silence prevails over the monastery where time seems
to stand still All these women have taken vows of poverty
obedience and chastity to serve god

On the other side of the cloister wall a small winding road
zigzags between the pine trees Bens car draws nearer He parks
in front of the entrance to the monastery

INT DAY - MIDWICH MONASTERY VESTIBULE

Ben pushes open the heavy front door The place is dark and
silent He goes to the front desk-

Behind a wooden screen he can barely make out the two nuns in
charge of admissions They are the only nuns granted exposure to
the outside world For the rest physical and visual contact is
strictly prohibited

SISTER
Yes how can I help you

BEN
Hello Sister I have come to visit a
member of your community Sister Anna
Her real name is Anna Esseker

SISTER
Is she expecting you

BEN
No not really

SISTER
Are you a relative

BEN
Listen Sister I must see her
SISTER
If you are not listed I cannot help

you sir
(MORE )

104

SISTER (CONTD)
We have strict regulations concerning
visitations which are exclusively for
family members

BEN
Please tell her that I came all the
way from New York and that I work with
Dr Kane at St Johns Hospital

SISTER
Wait here for a moment

She stands up and escapes through one of the back doors
The other nun behind the screen observes Ben with curiosity

Time goes by and Ben grows impatient

INT DAY - HOUSE NEW JERSEY

Inside the house in Jersey Amy has isolated herself with the
kids in the parents bedroom Shes reading them a bedtime
story

Even if all the windows screens and TV are covered by
newspapers or painting Amy acts in front of Daisy and Michael
as if nothing has happened

In the rest of the house everything has been meticulously
covered wrapped painted or reversed Still here and there

barely audible rustle pierces through the silence-

In the childrens room the paint covering the mirror slowly
begins to flake off

The newspaper wrapped around the windowpanes begins to rip
THE MIRRORS ARE RESISTING AND ATTEMPTING TO SET THEMSELVES FREE

107A INT DAY - MIDWICH MONASTERY VESTIBULE

Ben is losing his calm Time is running out The nun reappears
behind the wooden screen-

SISTER
Sister Anna has agreed to talk to you
you may proceed to the parlor next
door

Ben crosses the hall and opens the door that the nun gestures
him to

He enters the parlor alone In the spare room a chair stands by
a wooden screen fencing him off once again

107A 107A

Behind the screen a silhouette awaits him

SISTER ANNA
St Johns closed down in 1952 Who
are you

Ben sits down Even at a short distance he cannot discern the
face of Anna Esseker who is now Sister Anna

BEN
My name is Benjamin Carson I work as
a night watchman at 1229 West 38th
Street in New York City what used to
be St Johns Hospital

SISTER ANNA
What is it you want Mr Carson

BEN
I need your help

SISTER ANNA
My help I dont quite see how I could
possibly be of any help

BEN
My wife and children are in danger
What is threatening my family is
asking for you

For a split second Ben makes eye contact with Anna behind the
screen She has understood

BEN (CONTD)
If you dont help me I may lose the
only thing that matters to me

SISTER ANNA
I cannot leave the precincts Its
impossible

BEN
Tell me why are the mirrors from the
old hospital so determined to find
you

Sister Anna remains silent-—

BEN (CONTD)
I must know Sister

SISTER ANNA
It is not the wish of the mirrors to
find me but of what is imprisoned
inside them The mirrors are merely
windows on our world

107A 107A

BEN
A window For what For whom

ANNA
At the time that I was at St Johns
Dr Kanes therapy for personality
disorders consisted of locking the
patient up in a mirrored room for
several days on end in order to force
him to confront his own image I spent
the darkest days of my life in that
room On the 6th day the nurses found
me lifeless almost dead Since that
day I have never had another fit But
deep down inside Ive always known the
truth

BEN
What truth

ANNA
There is no cure for schizophrenia it
was something else Mr Carson And
whatever it was it entered the
mirror

We can feel the emotion in her voice

Everything

She stands

107A

ANNA (CONTD)
I thought that after fifty years this
would have all gone away They would
have disappeared from the mirrors I
didnt know Im sorry but if I
agree to go with you and return to
that place I will make it possible
for them to cross the threshold back
into the real world

is now making sense for Ben-

BEN
It entered with you and they need you
to get out

ANNA

The consequences of such an act Mr
Carson would be more devastating than
letting them suffer where they are
now Im going to pray for you and
your family Thats all I can do right
now Mr Carson God bless you

to leave 107A

BEN

Wait Please listen to me- Terence
Berry Gary Lewis and many others
before me Those are the people who

died trying to find you Because they
failed their families died too My
sister was murdered two days ago My
wife and kids will next if you dont
come with me Look-

From his wallet Ben takes out a wrinkled photograph of Michael
as a baby in Amys arms Daisy stands next to them in the
picture Ben presses the photograph against the grating for Anna
to look at it

BEN (CONTD)
My wife and two children Theyre all
Ive got Theyre innocent Please
Anna stays quiet a moment behind the screen and leaves
BEN (CONTD)
I KNOW YOU ARE SCARED OF GOING BACK
THERE ITS EASIER TO KEEP HIDING BUT
THIS IS NOT THE HOUSE OF GOD ANYMORE
WHILE YOURE PRAYING PEOPLE ARE DYING
ON YOUR TIME
Anna doesnt respond and disappears in the distance
Ben failed Hes desperate and lost He has a hard time
containing his anger

EXT DAY - MONASTERY 105

On the horizon a red sun sets behind the treetops Its almost
nightfall

The bells from the monastery begin to toll

The cross above the monastery reflects upside down in a puddle
of rain water

Frustrated Ben walks back to his car and dials his home number
on his cell phone -

EXT NIGHT -NEW JERSEY HOUSE 106

In the distance the lights of Manhattan sparkle in the night

In the house all the lights are off
All is quiet too quiet

INT NIGHT - HALLWAY

In the hallway the shiny doorknob leading to Amys bedroom is
the only reflecting surface that has been forgotten

In the distorted reflection we see Michaels silhouette
approaching The little boy reaches for the knob but-

IN REALITY NO HAND TOUCHES IT-

ITS MICHAELS REFLECTION INSIDE THE SHINY KNOB THAT IS OPENING
THE DOOR

Inside the bedroom Amy fell asleep with Daisy in her arms

On the bedside table THE HOME PHONE STARTS RINGING- She wakes
up with a jolt and picks up the cordless receiver-

AMY
Hello Ben Where are you Did you
find her Did you talk to

She stops speaking as she realizes- Daisy is asleep next to her
but MICHAEL IS NO LONGER THERE

AMY (CONTD)
Michael MICHAEL
(on the phone)
Ben hold on Michael is gone

BEN (0S)

AMY
(to Ben on the phone)
I dont know I fell asleep with the
kids on the bed and

She sees that THE BEDROOM DOOR IS HALF OPENED

AMY (CONTD)
Michael
The sound of pouring water is heard coming from the hallway
Michael must be in the bathroom

BEN (0S)
Amy whats going on Are you alright

Amy runs to the door waking Daisy up

DAISY
What is it Mom

108

AMY

(to her daughter)
You stay right here sweetheart Im

right here

(to Ben on the phone)
Ben I have to call you back I have
to find Michael

BEN (0S)
No Amy stay with me

109 INT NIGHT - CORRIDORBATHROOM - CONTINUITY

Amy comes out of the bedroom and notices that the floor is
completely soaked

She turns on the light in the hallway only to discover-

The entire upper floor is covered by an inch of water- all the
taps in the bathroom are turned on and have transformed the
surface of the floor into A LARGE NATURAL MIRROR

AMY
(to Ben on the phone)
Fuck There is water everywhere
Michael Michael MICHAEL
Amy freezes when she realizes that all the picture frames and
all the mirrors in the corridor have been scraped bringing the
reflecting surfaces once again to the light

AMY (CONTD)
(scared)
Ben someone scraped all the
mirrors There is someone in the
house

BEN (0S)
Where is Michael

AMY
(panicked)
I dont know where he is I dont see
him I

As she turns in the hallway Amy sees A DARK SHADOW MOVING IN

ONE OF THE MIRRORS Terrified she steps back and hits the
opposite wall She drops the phone on the flooded floor-

109A EXT DAY - MONASTERY

109A
At the same moment Ben still outside of the monastery is cut
off in his conversation with his wife-

109A 109A

BEN
Amy Amy Answer me

He tried to redial but that doesnt work He knows something
weird is happening there

Without hesitation Ben grabs his gun inside the car and walks
back towards the monastery gates
109B -BACK IN THE HOUSE- 109B

Unsure of what she saw Amy makes a step towards the mirror but
only finds her own reflection

She picks up the phone- The water shorted it out
109C

AMY
Damn it

Cautiously Amy walks up to the bathroom

AMY (CONTD)
Michael

She opens the door- the sink and bathtub are filled with water
overflowing onto the tiled floor Michael is not there

cut To

INT NIGHT - MONASTERY CELL 109C
A hand enters frame to light some candles

Sister Anna is back in her cell The way her hand shakes as she
carries the match from one candle to the other betrays how upset
she is by the confrontation with Ben- Its been too much time
that shes carrying the guilt

She runs the rosary nervously between her fingers and kneels
down in front of her bed to pray when-

A loud muted sound followed by a sudden wave of agitation is
heard outside the cell Someone has broken into the monastery
She recognizes Bens voice- Like a mad man hes looking for her
everywhere and threatens the other nuns to show him the way

Anna stands up when Ben bursts into her cell with his gun in his
hand Behind him the other nuns are terrified

Ben points the gun at Anna-
BEN
My kids are not going to die tonight
Youre coming with me now

109C 109C

Not intimidated by the weapon Anna steps towards Ben FOR THE
FIRST TIME BEN CAN SEE HER FACE- The old lady seems more
determined than ever-

ANNA
If I come with you Mr Carson you
have to promise to do everything I
tell you My way No questions

Ben lowers his gun-

BEN
You have my word

CUT TO

INT NIGHT- BEDROOM- MEANWHILE 110

Daisy waits patiently in the bed following her mothers
instructions Suddenly she hears her mother calling her from the
childrens bedroom-

AMY (0S)
Daisy Daisy Come here

Daisy steps into the corridor and stops for a moment when she
notices the flooding She enters her bedroom following the
voice that calls out for her-
AMY (0S) (CONTD)
Daisy Daisy

INT NIGHT - CHILDRENS BEDROOM - CONTINUITY 111

Daisy explores the bedroom The voice is still calling but her
mother is not there

The door shuts behind her

She walks up to the mirror on the wall The paint has been
partially scraped off-

THE LITTLE GIRL DISCOVERS HER MOTHERS REFLECTION ON THE OTHER
SIDE OF THE MIRROR-

INT NIGHT - BATHROOM - MEANWHILE 112
BUT IN REALITY AMY IS STILL IN THE BATHROOM

She turns off the tap and sinks her hand into the depths of the

bathtub to pull the plug when she sees Michaels reflection on
the surface -

Micha

She turns around but Michael is not behind her The reflection
lied

SUDDENLY HER ARM IS PULLED INTO THE BATHTUB

AN INVISIBLE FORCE PLUNGES HER HEAD INTO THE WATER TO DROWN HER
AMY STRUGGLES FRENETICALLY BUT THE PRESSURE IS TOO STRONG FOR
HER TO BREAK FREE

-BACK IN THE CHILDRENS BEDROOM-

Daisy walks up to her mothers reflection in the mirror

AMYS REFLECTION
Come sweetheart Come come closer
Come

Daisy is mistrustful She senses that something is not right In
the mirror her mothers attitude is different and strange

DAISY
What are you doing in there Mom

AMYS REFLECTION
Come closer dont worry Everything
is all right sweetheart

Daisy obeys when suddenly she notices that her mother holds a
pair of scissors in her hand

Daisy has no time to react-

THE REFLECTION OF THE MOTHER GRABS THE REFLECTION OF THE LITTLE
GIRL HOLDING HER FIRMLY IN HER ARMS-

BY SOME INVISIBLE FORCE IN REALITY DAISY IS SUSPENDED IN THE
AIR IN FRONT OF THE MIRROR

-BACK IN THE BATHROOM -

With her head still submerged in the bathtub Amy is drowning
She tries to fight back Unsuccessfully Her head stays under
the water
With the tips of her fingers Amy feels her way to the plug She
pulls it out
Slowly the water level begins to go down Too slowly Amy
struggles to pull her head out of the water to breath again

114

The water continues to recede Amy has reached exhaustion her
hands clutch onto the edge of the bathtub She is suffocating

At the last minute she turns her head to gasp for air

The remaining water swirls down the drain The bathtub is now
empty and the invisible force seems to have vanished

Amy collapses to the ground spitting and coughing She comes to
her senses gets back to her feet and dashes out of the
bathroom

AMY
Michael Michael

As she runs past the bedroom she notices that the door is open-

AMY (CONTD)
Daisy

Daisy is no longer there

AMY (CONTD)
Daisy

Panicked Amy crosses the corridor and barges into the
childrens room Inside she discovers-—

INT NIGHT - CHILDRENS ROOM

SUSPENDED IN THE AIR A FEW INCHES OFF THE GROUND DAISY
STRUGGLES TO BREAK FREE

In the mirror Amy sees her own reflection bringing the sharp
blade of the scissors to her daughters throat The blade glides
over her skin

In reality A TRICKLE OF BLOOD APPEARS ON DAISYS THROAT

Instinctively Amy throws herself against Daisy tearing her
away from the grip of her own reflection They land on the floor
and crawl to the corner of the room safe from the danger of the
reflections

Amy tears off a piece of her clothing which she presses against
Daisys throat in order to stop the bleeding

AMY
Oh my god dont move baby dont
move

Amy is out of control holding Daisy tightly in her arms She is
terror-stricken by the events in the house

115

AMY (CONTD)
Dont move sweetheart

Fortunately Daisys wound is not deep The blade did not reach
the main artery Amy saved her life at the very last minute

Daisy is half conscious from the loss of blood She struggles to
speak-

DAISY
Why did you do this Mom

AMY
(in tears)

It wasnt me Daisy it wasnt me I
would never hurt you you know that

DAISY
Whewhere is Michael

AMY
I dont know where he is Im going to
take care of you and then were going
to find himOK But for now we have to
get out of here

DAISY
Is Daddy coming back soon

AMY
Yes hell be here soon as he can

A bit further away in the scraped section of the mirror we
can see Amys reflection on its knees above Daisy who lies on
the floor-

IN THIS EVIL VERSION OF THE REALITY Amys double has killed her
own daughter Using the scissors shes working on the dead

body What exactly is she doing to the little girl

She turns toward us revealing HER FACE AND HANDS COVERED WITH
FRESH BLOOD

AMYS REFLECTION COMES CLOSER TO PEEK THROUGH THE MIRROR WITH
HER HANDS PRESSED AGAINST THE GLASS AS IF IT WERE JUST A
WINDOW

IN SEARCH OF THE REAL AMY AND DAISY the forces of the mirrors
are determined to get them

Away from the field of vision of the mirror Amy crawls on the
floor towards the door-

INT NIGHT - BEDROOM

Amy comes back to the bedroom carrying Daisy in her arms

As she passes the bureau she grabs the first-aid-kit from one
of the drawers She sets her daughter down in the walk-in
closet away from the mirrors The little girl has trouble
moving

Amy examines the cut on Daisys throat Quickly with a
professional touch she disinfects and bandages the wound

AMY
Listen to me carefully Daisy I want
you to stay in here and be quiet

Daisy is terrified and with her remaining strength she holds on
to her mother tightly

AMY (CONTD)
You have to be brave sweetheart I
want you to stay in here and not get
out until I come back no matter what
happens Im going to find Michael Do
you hear me

Not quite convinced Daisy accepts reluctantly

AMY (CONTD)
I am so proud of you

Amy shuts the door of the closet Through the wooden slats she
can see her daughter inside-

AMY (CONTD)
Dont move

Amy exits the room
117 INT NIGHT - CORRIDORSTAIRCASE

Even though she turned off the taps upstairs Amy can still hear
the water pouring downstairs

On guard Amy walks down the stairs step by step She is
frightened and her heart is pounding

AMY
Michael Michael

At the bottom of the stairs Amy catches sight of Michael at the
other end of the living room

had

117

The first floor is completely flooded ALL THE SPACE IS COVERED
BY A THIN LAYER OF WATER THATS MIRRORING EVERYTHING IN HOUSE

The little boy has climbed up onto a stool and is scraping the
paint off the mirror with a sharp knife It was Michael who

scraped all the mirrors in the house in order to set the force
of the mirrors free

AMY (CONTD)
Michael

He doesnt answer He doesnt seem to hear her
Amy comes down the last step

AMY (CONTD)
Michael What are you doing

The little boy turns around towards his mother with a big smile-
IN THE MIRROR HIS REFLECTION REMAINS FACING THEM

MICHAEL
They want to come play with us Mommy

Amy moves slowly towards her son

AMY
Michael I want you to drop that
knife do you hear me You know very
well you are not allowed to play with
that dont you

Michael looks at her in confusion and steps down from the stool
AMY (CONTD)

Thats a good boy now give me the
knife

Instead of obeying Michael runs off and disappears into another
room on the first floor

AMY (CONTD)
MICHAEL
Amy rushes after him

118 INT NIGHT - BEDROOM 118
Amys cell phone laying on the night table begins to ring On
the display we can see the call is from Ben

Through the wooden slats of the closet door Daisy catches sight
of the phone

118

She thinks about leaving the closet to answer but remembers her
mothers strict instructions about staying in the hiding place
The phone continues to ring but no one answer it

119 INT NIGHT - FIRST FLOOR

Amy hears the phone ringing upstairs but she cannot answer it
now- She must find Michael first

CUT TO

120 EXTINT NIGHT - BENS CAR - MANHATTAN

Bens car drives down a Manhattan street

Behind the wheel Ben is on the phone and gets Amys voicemail
He dials again-

BEN
Answer God damn it Answer the phone

Once again he gets the voicemail

BEN (CONTD)
Fuck
Ben is losing his calm

121 EXT NIGHT - MAYFLOWER DEPARTMENT STORE

Bens car pulls up in front of the department store Through the
windshield Anna catches sight of the devastated building
Ben hangs up the phone-
BEN
Somethings wrong over there my wife
is not answering
Ben is torn - He knows that going back to Amy isnt going to
help-
BEN (CONTD)
We have to get inside the Mayflower
now
Anna steps out She cannot conceal the sudden shiver that runs
through her when she stands in front of the former hospital-
ANNA
From now on Im going to close my
eyes
(MORE )

121 121

ANNA (CONTD)
Take me to the basement to the mirror
room It has to stop where it began

Ben grabs her forcefully-

BEN
Come on lets go

ANNA
Mr Carson no matter what happens in
there I want you to do as I say and
make sure I never get out of this
place

Ben pulls out his keys and unlocks the front door Anna closes
her eyes and follows him inside

INT NIGHT - ENTRANCE HALL- MAYFLOWER DEPARTMENT STORE

Anna has barely crossed the threshold when the hall mirrors
start trembling-

They can feel her presence

She tightens her grip around Bens hand She is anxious and
even with her eyes shut she can sense the threatening vibes
sent off by the mirrors

Ben is focused gazing straight ahead as they cross the ground
floor in the direction of the basement door

Yet from the corner of his eye he cannot help but glimpse the
mirrors What he discovers goes beyond his worst nightmares-

A CROWD OF MEN AND WOMEN FLAYED ALIVE CRAWLING AND PRESSING
THEMSELVES AGAINST THE GLASS PANES INSIDE THE MIRRORS THEY
OBSERVE BEN AND ANNA WITH BLANK LIFELESS GAZES SOME ARE
BANGING THEIR FISTS THEIR HANDS AND EVEN THEIR HEADS AGAINST
THE GLASS IN AN ATTEMPT TO BREAK FREE FROM THE MIRROR

SUDDENLY BEHIND HIM ONE OF THESE VISIONS BASHES AGAINST THE
MIRROR KEEPING ITS WIDE OPENED EYES ON THEM THE VISION STARTS
LICKING THE OTHER SIDE OF THE MIRROR LIKE AN ANIMAL

ANNA
They are waiting for me

Ben turns towards Anna and realizes that in the mirror theres
something else-

Annas reflection is different- ITS NOT THE OLD NUN ANYMORE BUT
THE 12 YEARS OLD GIRL EXACTLY AS ANNA WAS IN THE TIME OF ST
JOHNS HOSPITAL

INT NIGHT -NEW JERSEY HOUSE

We are back in the house
Amy is still searching for Michael She goes into the kitchen to
turn off the tap

Above the sink the newspaper on the windows had been ripped as
well and the hot steam is now covering the glass A HAND PRINT
APPEARS ON ONE OF THE WINDOW PANES AND SLIDES DOWN AGAINST THE
GLASS

The forces are everywhere

Amy steps back and runs out of the kitchen

THE THIN LAYER OF WATER ON THE FLOOR HAS TRANSFORMED THE ENTIRE
HOUSE INTO A MIRROR EXTENDING THROUGH EACH ROOM

AN INESCAPABLE MIRROR

The sound of rapid splashing footsteps catches her attention
Amy turns around and leaves the kitchen-

AMY
Michael

Michaels reflection sweeps over the water surface

Amy runs after him but stops short when she catches sight of
him Michael is hiding under the living room couch

She comes closer and bends over- THERE IS NO ONE UNDER THE
COUCH

Yet in the reflection of the wet floor Michael is there
He smiles at her playfully

IN A QUICK MOVEMENT THE LITTLE BOYS REFLECTION BRANDISHES THE
KNIFE IN EXCITEMENT AND TEARS IT THROUGH HIS MOTHERS FACE-

AMY LETS OUT A CRY OF PAIN AS SHE BRINGS HER HAND TO HER CHEEK-
THE INVISIBLE BLADE HAS SLASHED HER FACE

The blood gushes between her fingers Michaels reflection has
disappeared

She turns around just in time to catch sight of the little boys
reflection escaping His invisible footsteps splash in the water
as he moves further away

She hears Michael run up the stairs to the first floor

INT NIGHT - STEP-IN CLOSET

Protected from the mirrors in her hiding place in the closet
Daisy inspects the room through the wooden slats

Suddenly the bedroom door squeaks open Daisy curls up in the
corner of the closet overtaken with fear-

Its only the cat who enters the room with a meow

DAISY
Tiger Come here kitty come here

She opens the door a tiny crack to let him in The little girl
takes the pet in her arms reassuringly

INT NIGHT -MAYFLOWER BASEMENT

In the dark the surface of the water lies perfectly still We
are no longer in the New Jersey house but in the subterranean
passageways corridors of the department store

Ben and Annas silhouettes appear walking down the stairs

Ben turns on his flashlight The lights along the corridor are
too weak

BEN
Watch your step a water pipe has
burst the whole basement is flooded

Ben guides Anna with her eyes still shut through the tunnels

The beam of the flashlight sweeps across the walls and the
piping
They pass the junction of the two tunnels and arrive at the

demolished wall

ANNA
You stay outside

Anna steps over the rubble as she feels her way into the mirror
room

IN ALL THE MIRRORS ITS NOT ANNA THE NUN BUT ANNA THE LITTLE
GIRL THAT WE CAN SEE-

When she places her hand against one of the mirrors cracks
appear instantly The pressure on the other side is growing
stronger and stronger

125

Anna positions herself in the center of the room from where her
reflection is multiplied to infinity from all the possible
angles

She kneels down with her eyes closed

INT NIGHT -NEW JERSEY HOUSE 126

Compared to the gloom of the basement in the department store
the second floor of the house seems to be bathed in light

Michael is sitting quietly in front of his room As Narcissus
did he is observing his reflection mirrored in the surface of
the water that covers the wooden floor

AMY
Michael

Hypnotized by his mirror image the little boy does not hear his
mothers call

Amy appears at the top of the stairs and catches sight of him
AMY (CONTD)
Michael Michael look at me Im

right here

Michael doesnt answer Gently he caresses his reflection in
the surface of the water

Amy comes up to him slowly determined to pull him away from his
reflection

She lays her hand on his shoulder

This time Michael reacts and turns towards her

Before he can utter a single word-

THE REFLECTION OF THE HAND BECOMES REAL GRABBING THE CHILDS
WRISTS MICHAELS REFLECTION PULLS HIM THROUGH ITS SURFACE
MICHAEL DISAPPEARS INTO THE FLOOR

Amy throws herself to the ground in an attempt to catch him Too
late the little boy has been submerged in the thin layer of
water covering the floor MICHAEL HAS BEEN PULLED INTO THE OTHER
SIDE OF THE MIRROR

Amy sees her son struggling under the water as if he were
caught under a coat of ice

AMY (CONTD)
Michael Michael No no
( )

126
In desperation Amy beats her fists against the floor with all
her strength trying to break through to the other side

AMY (CONTD)
MICHAEL NOOOOO

Flying into a rage she beats her fists again and again in an
attempt to break the surface and save Michael from drowning

She sees Michaels body sinking into the depths

INT NIGHT - MIRROR ROOM

Back to the subterranean world of the department store
Ben is waiting in the corridor with his gun in hand

In the mirror room Anna recites a prayer for strength IN THE
REFLECTION YOUNG ANNA IS DOING THE SAME
The mirrors around her shake more and more violently-
Anna remains with her eyes still shut
Ben sees cracks forming on the walls and the surface of the
water at his feet trembling

127A INT NIGHT - MAYFLOWER

127A
SOMETHING IS HAPPENING IN THE REST OF THE STORE AS WELL- ON EACH
FLOOR IN EVERY DEPARTMENT ALL THE MIRRORS BEGIN TO VIBRATE

UNCONTROLLABLY TO TWIST OUT OF SHAPE TO SWELL TO SHRIVEL AND
FINALLY-

127B BACK IN THE MIRROR ROOM
127B
ANNA OPENS HER EYES-
ALL THE MIRRORS EXPLODE

FROM ONE AREA TO THE NEXT IN THE DEPARTMENT STORE THE
EXPLOSIONS ARE SPECTACULAR AND APOCALYPTIC

Annas eyes freeze- her pupils constrict- thousands of shards
of glass are sent flying into the air piercing through her body

like a dozen sharpened daggers

The blow of the explosion causes the walls to tremble
Instinctively Ben takes shelter behind the wall

128 INT NIGHT - NEW JERSEY HOUSE

MICHAELS BODY REEMERGES TO THE SURFACE

Amy clings to him and pulls him out of the water The little boy
is unconscious

She begins to shake him and to perform mouth-to-mouth
resuscitation as she applies rhythmical pressure to his chest
Amy tries not to lose her head determined to bring her little
boy back to life

Her eyes fill with tears blurring her vision She mustnt lose
faith She mustnt give up

Cardiac massage mouth-to-mouth resuscitation cardiac

MICHAEL REMAINS UNCONSCIOUS

INT NIGHT - MIRROR ROOM SUBTERRANEAN PASSAGEWAYS

IN THE BASEMENT THE CALM HAS BEEN RESTORED

Ben is still crouching behind the sheltering wall of the mirror
room In the silence he waits He must establish beyond a doubt
that its all over

He aims his flashlight at the surface of the water-

Everything seems to be back to normal His reflection is
deformed by the slight stir of the water slowly becoming
placid

Ben steps over the rubble to enter the mirror room-

All the mirrors have been pulverized leaving behind only the
metal cage that was holding them in place The floor is covered
with thousands of pieces of mirror floating in the water

shimmering in the shadows

The beam of the flashlight sweeps the room in search of Anna or
her dead body-

Nothing

Ben inspects all the dark corners behind the metal structure -
The woman has vanished

He aims his flashlight at the ceiling The beam of light
instantly reveals a dark shape hanging above him-

Its her or at least what is left of her- A POSSESSED
METAMORPHOSED HUMAN FRAME SHE IS BARELY RECOGNIZABLE

129 129

WITH HER EYES ROLLED UPWARD HER SLASHED FACE AND HER BODY
PIERCED BY THE SHARDS OF GLASS SHE LOOKS LIKE A DEMON DEPRIVED
OF ANY HUMAN TRAITS THE REAL ANNA DISAPPEARED FROM THE MOMENT
SHE OPENED HER EYES AND RELEASED THE FORCES OF THE MIRROR

Ben has no time to react before Anna charges at him

He drops his flashlight to the ground trying to resist her as
much as he can

HER WAY OF MOVING IS NO LONGER HUMAN MORE LIKE A STROBOSCOPIC
CONVULSION HER MOVEMENTS ARE SOMETHING BETWEEN AN ENRAGED BEAST
AND THE WORST EPILEPTIC FIT

Ben manages to pin the creature against the wall Anna spits
blood in his face

He applies all his strength to immobilize her- the shards of
glass dig deeper into the elderly womans flesh which only

seems to provide her an intense pleasure

Anna froths at the mouth Her speech has become a deep
animalistic incomprehensible gurgle

In an effortless movement Anna pushes him away

Her demonic strength is ten times his Ben is merely a puppet a
rag doll that she sends flying into the air only to crash
violently against the brick walls

Blood squirts onto the surface of the water

Ben smashes into the wall separating the mirror room from the
underground passageways

On the other side he lands on the ground in the dark He
strives to regain consciousness

Ben takes advantage of the brief respite to pull out his gun
but-

Anna appears from the dark and in a flash she strikes a
backhanded blow that sends the gun off into the air

She lifts Ben up and throws him across the room He rams into
the wall

With the absence of light in the basement Ben is defenseless
He cannot see his assailant

Ben is caught by the leg and dragged backwards His hand
struggles to catch on to anything that could hold him back

Suddenly under the water his hand lands on the gun He grabs
it turns onto his back and fires point-blank at Anna

The bullets go flying through her body but they dont stop her 129

Ben is being dragged He manages to grab hold of one pipe after
the other trying to hold on but the pipe gives way and breaks
off from the wall LETTING OUT A POWERFUL JET OF GAS

Once again Ben is sent flying down the tunnel
He struggles to get back on his feet-

Apart from the sound of the flowing gas a disturbing silence
surrounds the subterranean passageways

Ben makes out Annas silhouette hiding behind the leaking gas
pipe

With his bloodied face Ben is no longer the same man anymore-
Something in his eyes has shifted Rage and violence have
replaced the terror and dread He is determined to put an end to
the creature no matter what happens

He slides the weapon in his belt and steps with his bare hands
towards what once was Anna

Crouched over in the water the demon looks up ready to charge
Ben takes another step forward with the same determination The
creature thrusts itself against him-

THE CLASH IS EXTREMELY VIOLENT Ben uses all his strength to
keep his assailants jaw at a distance

In a swift movement Ben turns around AND IMPALES ANNA ON THE
BROKEN GAS PIPE

IN A GUSH OF BLOOD THE SHARP METAL TIP PIERCES THROUGH HER
STOMACH BUT-
Despite being momentarily immobilised the demon seems
unaffected by the near total destruction of its outer shell On
the contrary it struggles more violently to escape from the
trap

Ben moves away keeping an eye on Anna He takes his gun and
aims it at her Ben is exhausted With his arm outstretched he
is ready to shoot waiting for the right moment

The silhouette suddenly emerges from the dark

Ben stands by-

The demon goes through the cloud of gas- Ben fires-

THE EXPLOSION IS INSTANTANEOUS ANNA IS ENGULFED IN FLAMES
THE FIRE SPREADS THROUGH THE TUNNELS

Ben throws himself to the ground to avoid the flames

129 SUDDENLY IN A DOMINO EFFECT ONE EXPLOSION FOLLOWS THE OTHER A
BLAST OCCURS A BIT FURTHER DOWN THE TUNNEL AND ANOTHER INSIDE
THE WALLS

THE SUBTERRANEAN PASSAGEWAYS ARE ABOUT TO COLLAPSE-

Cracks appear everywhere The brick walls begin to fall apart

A part of the ceiling at the far end of the corridor caves in

Ben gets back on his feet and dashes for the stairs

Totally burnt flesh charred Anna is enraged by her preys
resistance The blazing demon runs after Ben

Behind them one after the other sections of the walls
collapse

Ben runs as fast as he can

Anna is coming closer to him when suddenly -
JUST BEHIND BEN A SECTION OF THE GROUND FLOOR CAVES IN BURYING
HER UNDER A MASS OF RUBBLE

Ben narrowly escaped the collapse He reaches the staircase and
catches sight of the exit above when suddenly-

THE ENTIRE FOUNDATION OF THE BUILDING COLLAPSES OVER HIM

Ben finds himself crushed along the floor and penetrates the
mirroring water surface DISAPPEARING ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE
MIRROR

129A INT NIGHT - JERSEY HOUSE
129A

All of her efforts are in vain Amy is unable to bring back her
son

Nonetheless she continues with the same determination refusing
to accept reality

She finally breaks down pleading with the sky above

129B THE OTHER SIDE OF THE MIRROR
129B

Lost and floating in this strange and unfamiliar place Ben
turns and sees Michaels bodysoul which is also trapped in this
parallel dimension on the other side of the mirror

In the distance he can see the surface leading to the hallway
of the New Jersey house Above it Amy tries to resuscitate
Michael

129B 129B

Ben grabs his son and holds him tightly in his arms fora
moment then pushes him towards the surface-

THE CHILD OPENS HIS EYES-

INT NIGHT -NEW JERSEY HOUSE 130

MICHAEL COMES AROUND COUGHING OUT THE WATER FROM HIS LUNGS Amy
bursts into tears sobbing with joy She holds him tightly in
her arms with all her strength with all her love

Holding Michael in her arms Amy comes back for Daisy in the
bedroom She opens the closet door and finds her little girl
inside The child throws herself into her mothers arms-

DAISY
It is over Mom

Amy throws a glance at her reflection in the mirror Everything
seems back to normal

AMY
Yes sweetheart its over

Amy holds her two children tightly savoring this moment of joy
and relief

Through the window we see the first light of dawn appearing on
the horizon
INT DAWN - MAYFLOWER 131

The sunbeams slice through the windowpanes of the glass dome
above the entrance hall of the department store

The pigeons fly in and out

The burnt mannequins are still standing in the middle of the
ruins

ON THE WALLS ALL THAT REMAINS FROM THE MIRRORS IS THEIR 1920s
GOLD FRAMES

The floor has completely subsided It looks like there was just
an earthquake under the building

In the middle of the pile of debris something in the rubble
begins to move-

A HAND APPEARS SOMEBODY SURFACES -

Its Ben He gasps for air Wounded and covered in dust it is a
miracle that he has survived

( )

131
He struggles back to his feet and climbs over the blocks of
concrete to regain the ground floor
Limping he crosses the entrance hall His discovery of the
absence of mirrors on the walls brings a smile to his face- He

has finally triumphed over the mirrors that he once believed to
be indestructible

EXT DAY - MAYFLOWER

Ben steps out of the department store walks out of the closed

off area and reaches the street

Police cars fire trucks and ambulances with spinning lights
have surrounded the fencing

Ben approaches the scene He needs medical attention He catches
sight of Lorenzo talking to some policemen Ben stops dead in

his tracks-

THE NAME LORENZO EMBROIDERED ON THE UNIFORM IS WRITTEN
BACKWARDS

Ben glances at the police vehicles and their license plates-
How is it possible EVERYTHING IS REVERSED
Ben steps back in panic

As he walks away from the scene we discover something else in
the back of the ambulance-

ANNAS CHARRED CADAVER THAT HAS BEEN DUG OUT OF THE RUBBLE

EXT DAY - TIME SQUARE

Ben walks up west 38th Street to Broadway and stops at the

intersection of the streets paralyzed with fear-

The activity of Time Square seems normal for an early morning

cars driving by and the eternal hustle and bustle of the
pedestrians but ALL THE SIGNS ALL THE BILLBOARDS ARE REVERSED
AND SO IS THE DIRECTION OF THE TRAFFIC FLOW

Ben turns around towards a glass building where a homeless
person is sleeping-

His eyes fill with horror-

HE CAN SEE THE REFLECTION OF THE HOMELESS MAN BUT NOT HIS OWN

133

Ben presses his hand against the glass The reflection of the
world surrounding him is the right way around in the mirror but
he remains invisible

He removes his hand from the mirror leaving a clear and well-
defined handprint on the reflective surface

Ben slowly comes to realize what is happening to him -

IF HIS REFLECTION IS NOT THERE IT MEANS THAT HE NO LONGER
BELONGS TO THE WORLD OF THE LIVING BEN DID NOT SURVIVE-

HIS SOUL IS NOW A CAPTIVE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE MIRROR

EXT DAY - MAYFLOWER

Back in the ambulance a paramedic comes to close the back door

The vehicle starts and leaves the Mayflower

EXT DAY - NEW-YORK - CONTINUITY

The ambulance turns on the avenue

INT DAY - AMBULANCE - MOVING

In the back of the ambulance as the vehicle drives away
discover that another corpse is laid out next to Annas-
ITS BENS BODY COVERED WITH DUST AND DRY BLOOD
Its fingers suddenly twitch
Was it the bumpy road
The dead fingers twitch again and-
IN THE SHADOW BENS CORPSE SLOWLY BEGINS TO STAND
It turns its head-
BENS EYES ARE ROLLED UPWARD NO LONGER HUMAN
EVIL
