BUDDY (ON TV)
Dragos son deserves some respect -
- Life is supposed to give second
chances -- This man has lived a
real life Adonis Creed took the
easy route He got a break he
didnt deserve If his father
didnt break down barriers if he
wasnt a real warrior Adonis Creed

EXT STREET - NIGHT

ADONIS is alone in his MUSTANG Driving nowhere in

the radio He turns if OFF and stares out into the night
EXT EUROPE - EARLY MORNING

It is cool miserable misty weather

We see VITOR DRAGO jogging in a crappy mostly deserted old
INDUSTRIAL SECTION of town

His hood is pulled tight as SWEAT and RAIN pour down his
face He looks menacing

Following close behind is IVAN DRAGO His countenance is
cold pitiless

He flashes the LIGHTS indicating to pick up the pace

VITOR does not IVAN BLASTS THE HORN Still VITOR remains
defiant

IVAN brings the car closer so close in fact that he nearly
brushes up against the back of his sons legs

VITOR suddenly leaps to the side and POUNDS THE HOOD with a
hammer fist

IVAN SLAMS ON THE BRAKES and slowly gets out He matches his
sons seething stare

DRAGO
(in Russian)
Run -- You are me -- I am you

The only sound is the monotonous rain as the smoldering
tension subsides as VITOR peels off and continues running
