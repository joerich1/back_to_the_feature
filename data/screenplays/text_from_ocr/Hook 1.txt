Peter Pan coming and going through when we were young

REVEAL WENDY SILHOUETTED at the window her back to us

vintage toys The corpulent Irish Housekeeper has been run-
ning the Darling house for decades She talks a bluestreak

LIZA
Let’s be getting you dressed now
You’11 want to be looking your best

WENDY
I was just tidying up my memory Liza
It seems I’ve spent a great deal of
my life waiting at this window

Her gentle voice still wistful but regal aged with grace

LIZA
(taking over the brush)
Excuse me for saying but you’re
having a hospital named after you
this evening for helping orphans and
homeless children--not for staring
gut windows--

Wendy pats Liza’s hand with her own Her hand is old Much
older But her laugh still tinkles like giass Liza worries
about Wendy when she gets like this

LIZA -
You won’t be worrying about Peter
now Wendy Mum He’1l be here He’s
flying home ‘this very moment--

Liza points out the open window as if expecting Peter to
fly right in and land

Granny Wendy laughs her soothing glassy tinkle

WENDY

Your father worries too much about
a great too many things

(remembering)
Of course when I first met him he
couldn’t read a word He didn’t
even know his name or who his Mummy
and Daddy were Just a poor little
orphan boy--he was

MAGGIE
Is that why he grew up to be a lawyer

GRANNY WENDY
(girlish laughter)
Your father used to be a very wild and
rambunctious child believe it or not

Jack perks up at the window suddenly interested

JACK
I don’t believe it

GRANNY WENDY
It’s true Jack He reminded me so
much of the little boy from Neverland
I called him Peter Your grandparents
adopted him with that name and moved to
to the States What a wild mischieveous
child he was--so full of life

She trails off lost in the memory

MAGGIE

PETER

He smoothes Jack’s hair He’s not connecting Lingering in
the face of rejection he checks the window one last time
turns on the nightlight and finally leaves

IN THE HALL - CONTINUING ACTION

Peter exits leaving the door just ajar Taking one final
peek--his kids are in safe in bed He did it He sags
against the wall--a deep sigh of relief The giant burden
of parenthood for the moment relieved

Granny Wendy startles him in the dim light

GRANNY WENDY

It’s been a long time since I’ve

heard the sounds of children in that
roombefore they have to grow up and
face the world I do so miss it

Peter is tense again His momentary relief gone

PETER

Okay just tell me--just tell me--

ways to get hurt---or kill themselves

Patience was never one of your virtues
You must trust me with all your heart
for you will surely think me insane

(grips his hand with

surprising strength)
I knew something was wrong tonight
I felt a chill I haven’t had since I
was a young girlPeter I know what
has happened to your childr has to
do with who and what you are

She starts to nod off--drifting Peter takes her hand

PETER
Gran--what are saying--What

WENDY
You don’t remember Your memory was
completely blank each Spring you
returnedto see me

She caresses his hand tenderly adopting the motions and
voice of Wendy the girl

WENDY
I wasspecial when I was young No
other girl held your favor the way I
dida blessing or a curse1 don’t
knowI begged you to stay when mother
and father adopted Tootles and the other
boys--but you were afraid to grow up
and be a man and go to an office and
learn solemn things-

He knows Gran is delerious She has to be She has to be

WENDY

Oh I half expected you to alight on
the church and forbid the vows on my
wedding day I wore a pink satin sash
Butyou didn’t come I couldn’t have
you When you were ready I was too
oldSo was ny daughter Margaret and
Jane You chose the bestMoira

No--No I have tried so many times to
tell you--

(clutching the book)
The stories here are true Tootles

trying not to He never forgot--

(she drifts losing it)

You forgot the child inside you
You gave up immortality in one world
for the pain and joy of life and death
in this one Now the world you left
has come to seek revenge-

(dead serious)
--only you can save your children
Somehow you have to go pack--think as a
child--believe in childish things again

forget-me-not and of profound melancholy save when
he was plunging his hook into you at which time two
red spots appeared in them and lit them up horribly

Hook limbers up with his lethal sword

HOOK

(to himself sardonic)
Behold my multitudes of ignorant
flotsam There’s not brains enough
among you to count successfully from
1 to 2 My body waste inspires more
allegiance than the lot of you
I am marooned Where are you Pan
Oh the eternal hell I endure for
fame that glittering bauble
-It is mine

Hook bows a matinee idol taking a curtain call

TINK leans down from the hat right in Peter’s face She
doesn’t like what she sees

PETER wobbles on the plank looking down at the uninviting
waters 50 feet below Vertigo takes hold

TINK
He will be 7 days Think about it

Tink directs Hook’s attention to the Crew all waiting on
the main deck in anticipation

TINK
Look at your crew Do you want to be
stuck on the high seas with this bunch
of psychos after you disappoint then
They’11 be antsy moody--no self esteem
I sure wouldn’t want them on my hands

PAN THE CREW

As Hook surveys them Antsy moody no self-esteem major
disappointment let down goals destroyed betrayed

HOOK

HOOK

(whispering to Tink)
We both need Pan don’t we Miss Bell

TINK
(whispering back)
Does a crock tick in the dark

Hook Perish the thought--then with villainous aplomb

HOOK

After further consideration in the
best interests of all concerned I
have agreed this so-called Pan will
