The second hand on a clock ticks away in extreme CU Its just past

midnight

Pull back revealing a Cartier clock sitting on a night table A
GLOVED HAND enters frame and swipes it off the table- This is

clearly a robbery in progress

Next the gloved hand slides into an opened dresser drawer carefully

searching though clothing

Dressed in black and wearing night vision goggles the cat burglar

maneuvers through the dark with precision

Seen through the thiefs bluish-green POV he enters a closet and

searches through an underwear drawer Its obvious he is
with cutting edge technology

an expert

He finally pulls out A SMALL JEWELRY BOX opens it and removes
diamond earrings gold chains and a ladys watch He puts

everything in his backpack

Suddenly headlights appear through the window wiping across the
bedroom wall and catching the burglars reflection in the mirror He

removes the bulky night vision goggles- Its Eli

starts to undress unaware of someone watching them-

THE WOMAN WALKS OUT OF THE CLOSET WITHOUT EVER SEEING ELI WHO STANDS
BEHIND A ROW OF CLOTHES The young burglar smiles enjoying the idea
of being invisible

WOMAN
Did you see the way she was looking at
you

MAN

She was not looking at me We had
three bottles of wine She was staring
off into space I just happened to be
in it

The man goes to the bathroom while his wife stands at the dresser
removing her jewelry

WOMAN

out as well

The woman now joins her husband and they continue from their
respective sinks

WOMAN (CONTD)
-and I know the difference between
staring into space and flirting

Eli stealthily moves past the bathroom door His gloved hands pass
over the dresser picking up the watch the womans jewelry and
removing money from the mans wallet

Suddenly the man walks out of the bathroom wiping his face with a
towel

When he lowers it Eli is gone
MAN
It certainly seems like youve given
it some thought Are you sure youre
not the one who wants to spice things
up

The woman joins her husband as he gets into bed

The door to an Art Deco armoire opens revealing rows of crystal

shiny silverware- the kind which is passed from generation to
generation
He smiles as he removes A SINGLE SILVER SPOON

Unlike the chaos of the first room Elis room is much neater Two

beds sit on opposite sides of eachother next to two desks furnished
with identical lamps

Julian an Asian student sits at the window pointing a small
satellite dish at another building He wears a pair of headphones

Eli slides his backpack under the bed and begins undressing

ELI

JULIAN
Nope But its just a matter of time

ELI

( )

JULIAN
(to himself)
Just a matter of time

Eli lays in bed and closes his eyes
EXT U OF M CAMPUS - NEXT MORNING 16

The UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN campus is buzzing with fall semester
activity

Eli bikes to class when he veers off onto the sidewalk in front of
MANNYS HOUSE OF BURRITOS

MANNY a Mexican in his fifties smiles as he hangs outside the to-

go window with a white paper bag filled with food
Eli rides by grabbing the bag

MANNY
You got three minutes Eli

ELI

EXT DIAG SQUARE - MORNING 17

Lined with beautiful red orange and yellow trees three long
sidewalks converge into the social center known as The Diag Eli
stops his bike in front of a large message board where thousands of
notes and advertisements are pinned- Guitar Lessons Apts-4-Rent
Ride Sharing etc

He takes down a note and reading it brings a smile to his face
EXT U OF M CAMPUS - CONTINUOUS 18

Among the rows of ivy covered 19th century buildings is HUTCHINS
HALL the beautifully restored law center

FEMALE VOICE (0S)
- We of the Republic pledged
ourselves to drive from the temple of
our ancient faith those who had
profaned it But our covenant with
ourselves did not stop there

INT U OF M CLASSROOM - CONTINUOUS 19
In a stadium seating classroom with the words HISTORY OF CORPORATE

CRIME written on the chalkboard PROFESSOR FREEDMAN an attractive
woman in her late forties reads from a book-

( )

PROFESSOR FREEDMAN
Instinctively we recognized a
deeper need to find through
government

An embodiment of the American melting pot the ethnicity of the
student body is as varied as it is numerous

PROFESSOR FREEDMAN (CONTD)
- the instrument of our united
purpose to solve for the individual
the ever-rising problems of a complex
civilization

Among the many attentive students Eli sits in the center listening
and occasionally jotting down notes

PROFESSOR FREEDMAN (CONTD)
- To do this we knew that we must
find practical controls over blind
economic forces and blindly selfish
men

Elis eyes drift towards a full lock of blond hair and curvy
shoulders on a coed a few rows down

The girl looks back at Eli revealing a cute face covered in
freckles She smiles at him and he quickly shifts his eyes back to

his notes

PROFESSOR FREEDMAN (CONTD)
- We have always known that heedless
self-interest was bad morals we know
now that it is bad economics Out of
the collapse of a prosperity has come
the conviction that in the long run
economic morality pays

She lowers the book and removes her glasses

PROFESSOR FREEDMAN (CONTD)
- Believe it or not that speech was
given by Franklin D Roosevelt in his
1937 inaugural address He was
commenting on corporate greed and its
effect on the Great Depression

Suddenly the bell rings but the professor raises her hands
silencing the class

PROFESSOR FREEDMAN (CONTD)
Which brings me to your
homework

( )

A general moan fill the class

PROFESSOR FREEDMAN (CONTD)
- Write two thousand words comparing
the corporate misconduct of the Great
Depression to the more recent wave of
corporate criminals and their effect
on the global economy See you next
time

The students stand and begin exiting the class
Eli walks to the front of the room

ELI
Why is it that when times get
difficult everybody blames the guys at
the top Yet when everyones making
money those same people are considered
geniuses

Professor Freedman picks up her attaché case and Eli follows her out
of the classroom through a crowded corridor-

PROFESSOR FREEDMAN
Still looking to become a lawyer to
the rich and famous Mr Burns

ELI
Everyone has the right to counsel

PROFESSOR FREEDMAN
But no one is above the law

ELI
What about the laws of nature

PROFESSOR FREEDMAN
A society doesnt live according to
natural laws it functions through the
Rule of Law

ELI
But doesnt ours work because it fits
our nature Survival of the fittest
EXT HUTCHINS HALL - DAY 20

Eli and the professor continue down the long hallway

ELI
You want to know what I think

( )

PROFESSOR FREEDMAN
Im sure youll tell me anyway

ELI
Basically I think those corporate
criminals you were talking about were
just doing what came naturally to them-
following their instincts

PROFESSOR FREEDMAN
Theyre still criminals

ELI
But look at Robin Hood He was a
thief and everyone loved him

PROFESSOR FREEDMAN
Youre comparing Bernie Madoff to
Robin Hood He stole from the rich and
gave it to himself

ELI
Just like the government I get it
now

The professor laughs and continues walking

PROFESSOR FREEDMAN
Why dont you join the debate team
this year Eli We could use someone
like you

ELI
Thanks Ill think about it

They arrive in front of the administrative section of the building
PROFESSOR FREEDMAN
Of course youll have to leave out the
mythical characters Have a good

lunch

ELI
You too See you later

The professor walks into an office

An internet window opens to the- University Of Michigan Tuition
Accounts page

Eli sits on his bed with his laptop paying his tuition

At the bottom of the page in red letters Past Due - 13350 Eli
types in 1000 and clicks- Confirm Payment

Just then Theo and Aaron enter the room

AARON
Hey you dorks have a lighter

THEO
You guys coming to the Delta party

Theo puts on Julians headphones and looks out the window

JULIAN
Hey leave that alone

Meanwhile Aaron searches through Elis desk drawer for a lighter
barely noticing a framed photo of an average middle class couple
happily posing with their children- ELIS FAMILY

JULIAN (CONTD)

Why dont you stop going through our
stuff and get out you smelly cock

( )

AARON
Uh Its Cock-ney Ok

He removes a tin can from the drawer and opens it when ELI JUMPS UP
FROM HIS BED

ELI
Dude Get out of there I dont smoke

Aaron discovers A COLLECTION OF SILVER SPOONS INCLUDING THE ONE HE
STOLE FROM THE HOUSE ELIS NIGHT JOB HAS KEPT HIM BUSY

AARON
What the hell is this You have forks

Eli grabs the can from Aaron and puts it back in the drawer

AARON (CONTD)
You know you have to be born with one
in your mouth You cant just collect
them

THEO
(re the microphone)
Whoa You got one

Julian takes the headphones away from Theo and listens- The
satellite dish is pointed to a window across the street where a
woman is clearly moaning in ecstacy

AARON
Let me hear it

But something preoccupies Eli who grabs his backpack and exits the
room

JULIAN
Where are you going Eli

All of a sudden a curtain swings open in the window across the
street-—

THEO
Look

A hot girl helps her lover up from the bed- ANOTHER HOT GIRL
Theo Aaron and Julian stand at the window drooling

AARON THEO

EXT CITY LANDSCAPE - DAY 24

HERE BRICK BUILDINGS ARE BOARDED UP AND ABANDONED WHILE THE STREETS
ARE LITTERED WITH THE DECOMPOSING METAL CARCASSES OF OLD CARS
WELCOME TO MOTORCITY

EXT GREYHOUND BUS STATION - LATE DAY 25

A Greyhound bus stops at the station and Eli exits with the
familiarity of a local

EXT DETROIT NEIGHBORHOOD - LATE DAY 26

Eli walks along the desolate and dangerous steets of an urban
neighborhood

Years of economic downfall has decimated this part of town turning
it into a shady neighborhood Most Ann Arbor students would be
scared to walk these streets but not Eli

He arrives at a broken down one story house and waits for a car to
drive by before moving around to the back

Carefully Eli looks inside the windows casing the property
Judging by the old flickering TV going on and off and by the poor
dirty conditions of the interior he is not here to rob it

CUT TO
Eli slips an envelope under the door and leaves
Seconds later the front door opens revealing a woman holding the
envelope clearly containing money Pale and worn from years of
substance abuse her wrinkled face seems older than it should be

She looks around the yard and finally calls out

WOMAN
Richie Is that you Richie

INT GREYHOUND BUS - MAGIC HOUR 27
Back on the bus Eli sits somberly watching the sunsets golden

reflection glimmering off the Detroit skyline- Once a vibrant city
now fading darkly into the night

EXT TRI-DELTA SORORITY HOUSE - NIGHT 28
A drunk student is carried out of a large house with the Tri-Delta
sign hanging over the front door Students loiter on the lawn which
is littered with red and blue cups like electric flowers Music
pulses from inside

INT TRI-DELTA SORORITY HOUSE - NIGHT 29

This party is off the hook The place is packed and a thick crowd
of students dance in the middle of the living room

Theo and Aaron are among them holding drinks while trying to rub up
against coeds- Evidently its not working

Meanwhile Julian talks to a very tall volleyball player

Eli on the other hand stands off to the side by himself drinking a
beer

A brunette smiles at him from across the room when-

GIRL (0S)
Hey

He turns to find the cute blond from his morning class- CHARLOTTE
LAMBERT

ELI

ELI
Nothing You know Hangin’ out

CHARLOTTE

Charlotte points at the brunette across the room

ELI (CONTD)
Really Sure why not

Cool as ice he lets her lead him by the hand

Both Aaron and Theo take notice as Eli and Charlotte walk up the
sorority house stairs- How does he do it

INT SORORITY DORM ROOM - NIGHT 30
Charlotte enters the small room and pins Eli against the door

CHARLOTTE

CHARLOTTE

ELI

CHARLOTTE

Charlotte smiles and suddenly GRABS HIS BALLS TAKING TOTAL CONTROL

CHARLOTTE
I think this ones all talk and no
action

ELI

Oh hey OK jokes over

CHARLOTTE

orgies

She squeezes harder
ELI
Ow Ow Cmon Charlotte I was just

She finally lets him go
CHARLOTTE
Forget it this was a mistake Im not

She tries to open the door but Eli blocks her in He reaches into
his pocket and removes the note he took from the message board

( )

ELI

CHARLOTTE
That was meant for someone else

ELI
Its got my name on it

CHARLOTTE
No That Eli is not a sex addict

ELI

ELI

ELI

CHARLOTTE

ELI

He tries to kiss up on her

CHARLOTTE

( )

ELI
That sounds great

CHARLOTTE

He gives up trying

ELI
If you want to get bored to death

CHARLOTTE

ELI

Charlotte nods seductively They kiss and Eli looks deep into her
eyes

ELI (CONTD)
So wheres your friend

CHARLOTTE
Oh Im gonna kill you

( )

She slaps him playfully but Eli lifts her over his shoulder and
they both land together on her bed The next kiss is deep and
passionate

CUT TO

A few hours later Eli lays awake next to Charlotte who is fast
asleep

After looking at her he slowly slips out of her bed grabs his
clothes and quietly walks out of the room

CUT TO
EXT U OF M LIBRARY - LATE NIGHT 31
Eli walks up the grand stairs to the beautiful library
He enters through the doors and passes through a turnstile swiping
his library card His name comes up on the card reader-ELI BURNS
117 AM

EXT UPSCALE NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT 32

A PATROL CAR drives through an upscale neighborhood lined with
beautiful homes and royal oak trees

As it disappears Eli steps out from the shadows dressed in his
black burglars uniform He looks at his watch its almost 2AM

He eyes a colonial home and crosses the street

EXT HOUSE - NIGHT 33
Jumping over the backyard fence Eli walks to the back of the house
checking in each of the windows Looking inside with his

flashlight he notices small alarm wires glued to the glass

He removes a small drill from his bag and quietly punctures the
glass He then pulls the small wire through the hole and attaches it
to a bypass clamp

The clamp is connected to an electrical measuring device which reads-
00

ELI
(to himself)
Its not even on

Using a slim-jim he quietly jiggles the lock free and finally lifts
up the window listening inside for any noise

Satisfied he straps on his night-vision goggles

INT HOUSE- KITCHEN - NIGHT 34
Eli enters the house very quietly

The street lamps outside provide enough light so that Eli does not
need to switch to night vision

He is cautious and meticulous- A real professional
He studies each valuable object in the house

Slowly with THE HARDWOOD FLOOR CREAKING BENEATH HIS FEET Eli makes
his way through the dining room

An old commode grabs his attention He opens the first drawer and
finds- HIS SIGNATURE SILVER SPOON

He picks one up and puts it into his pocket
INT HOUSE- GROUND FLOOR - CONTINUOUS 35

Eli steps into the living room where he notices an amazing
collection of paintings and pottery from all around the world

ELI
(whispering sarcastically)
Im sure Larry would be very
impressed

It all seems valuable but too big to be carried out He picks up a
gold cigarette lighter a couple of silver candlesticks and a few
other trinkets off the mantle

His attention shifts to a grand piano where an arrangement of family
photos is neatly placed He takes a closer look

The owners are intellectual liberals from the 60s One picture
shows the couple standing in the Amazonian Rain Forest

ELI (CONTD)
(whispering)
Tree huggers Great

Scanning the room he takes one last look but nothing seems to be of
much interest

He heads towards the entry way without realizing HE HAS JUST STEPPED
INTO A DARK LIQUID SUBSTANCE

Facing a dark staircase he finally switches to night vision mode-

The staircase illuminates and Eli calmly climbs up to the next
floor

INT HOUSE- SECOND FLOOR CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS 36

At the top of the stairs he finds a long hallway with doors leading
to the bedrooms He must be especially quiet

With precaution he enters the first room
INT HOUSE- OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 37

Books are stacked everywhere in this room which contains a large
desk and several boxes piled high with documents

Still in night vision mode Eli scans the walls which are covered
with engineering degrees one of them from THE UNIVERSITY OF
MICHIGAN The owner is obviously a scientist and a scholar

Eli moves to the desk searching for anything to steal but the mess
is a surprising contrast to the rest of the house He tries to clear
the papers but except for a few Mont Blanc pens there is nothing
of value here

SUDDENLY THROUGH A CRACK IN THE DOOR A SHADOW MOVES ALONG THE
HALLWAY ELI STIFFENS QUICKLY TURNS AROUND AND GOES TO CHECK

INT HOUSE- SECOND FLOOR- CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS 38

Peering from the doorway he scans the hall Nothing No one All
the doors are closed Just paranoia

Eli returns into the office
INT HOUSE-OFFICE —- CONTINUOUS 39

On a shelf among framed sport photos Eli notices a signed baseball
suspended in a clear plexiglass cube

Eli grabs the baseball and sticks it in his bag
ELI
(to himself)
These people have nothing

INT HOUSE- SECOND FLOOR- CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS 40

He exits the office and continues down the hall to the other rooms
He doesnt notice someone else is moving in the dark

Eli slowly opens a second door finding the beds made- probably a
guest room He closes the door and moves on

With tension mounting he explores the next room He reaches for the

door when he notices its slightly ajar He looks around He
couldve sworn the doors were all closed

( )

Intrigued he slowly pushes the door open and freezes-

A MAN HANGS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM HE JUMPS BACK AND REMOVES HIS
GOGGLES AS IF HE WAS TRYING TO RID THE VISION FROM HIS EYES

BUT THE MAN IS STILL THERE HANGING FROM THE CEILING WITH A BELT
AROUND HIS NECK HIS FACE PALE WITH HIS EYES ROLLED BACK-DEAD ELI
RECOGNIZES THE OWNER FROM THE PHOTOS AROUND THE HOUSE

Eli is stunned He cannot understand nor is he trying to This is a
good time to leave

He turns back and exits the room in a hurry
INT HOUSE- STAIRS- GROUND FLOOR - CONTINUOUS 41
He runs down the stairs when he notices footprints on the carpet

He stops to check his shoes His soles are covered in something
Those are his footprints on the ground

ELI
Shit

He touches the liquid confirming his worse fear- Its blood But
where could it be from

Now panic sets in Especially when he hears a strange noise He
comes down the remaining stairs on high alert

INT HOUSE- GROUND FLOOR - CONTINUOUS 42

Worried he continues following the footprints and as they become
more defined he knows hes getting to the source

Finally he spots a large puddle of blood spreading from the
bathroom The noise he heard comes from inside

The best thing to do is keep moving and he knows it But curiosity
gets the best of him- Slowly and with tension filling the darkness
he opens the door to the bathroom

INT HOUSE- BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS 43
INSIDE A NAKED AND BLOODIED FEMALE IS IN THE BATHTUB WITH HER EYES
WIDE OPEN HER THROAT CUT SHE AGONIZES IN PAIN HER FOOT SLAMMING
REPEATEDLY AGAINST THE SHOWER DOOR

ELI
Oh shit

Shocked Eli takes a second to fully comprehend THE WOMAN IS DYING
BEFORE HIS VERY EYES He has no idea what to do

( )

SHE GURGLES LOUDLY AS THE SLAMMING OF THE DOOR INCREASES IN
INTENSITY HER EYES WIDEN STARING RIGHT BEYOND HIM

He takes out his phone and dial slowly stepping away from the
ghastly sight

ELI (CONTD)
Im calling for help Im calling

Eli turns to talk when-
HE IS STRUCK ON THE SIDE OF THE HEAD AND FALLS BACK IN THE BATHROOM

THE SCENE TURNS CHAOTIC AS ELI SCRAMBLES TO HIS FEET AND LUNGES AT
THE AGGRESSOR

THEY FIGHT SLAMMING AGAINST THE WALLS AND THE SINK UNTIL THE MAN
LANDS RIGHT ON TOP OF ELI

HE GETS HIT WITH A FLURRY OF BLOWS WHEN HE FINALLY SWINGS BACK
PUNCHING THE ASSAILANT IN THE CHIN AND GETTING A QUICK GLIMPSE OF
HIS FACE

BEFORE THE OTHER MAN CAN RECOVER ELI JUMPS UP AND DISAPPEARS INTO
THE KITCHEN

INT HOUSE- KITCHEN - NIGHT 44

WITH HIS NIGHT VISION GOGGLES HALFWAY OFF HIS FACE ELI CLIMBS
THROUGH THE OPEN KITCHEN WINDOW

EXT HOUSE - NIGHT 45

Eli runs along the bushes trying to stay in the shadows He hops on
his bike and peddles away

ELI
Shit Shit

INT HOUSE- GROUND FLOOR - NIGHT 46
Back at the house THE KILLER who just attacked Eli stands by the
open kitchen window He notices something on the floor- A CELL

He picks it up and when he flips it open finds A PICTURE OF ELI AND
CHARLOTTE SMILING

Julian starts dialing his I-phone

ELI (CONTD)

Eli grabs the phone from Julians hand and hangs up

Eli grabs a few things from his room including the box of spoons in
his drawer

Julian sits up noticing his roommate sweating and acting very edgy

JULIAN (CONTD)
Are you all right

ELI

He stuffs his bag full and runs out of the room

JULIAN
My phone

EXT UPSCALE NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT 50

Eli slowly rides his bike back to the crime scene but when he turns
onto the street blue and red flashing lights illuminate the
neighborhood in the distance

Now walking his bike Eli approaches a group of neighbors who have
gathered a few houses down Eli is stunned- Hes too late

THE HOUSE HE JUST ROBBED IS NOW A FULL FLEDGED CRIME SCENE- TAPED

OFF BARRICADED AND SURROUNDED WITH POLICE CARS AN AMBULANCE AND
A CORONERS VAN

Eli watches as uniformed police and detectives walk around the
house A body bag is wheeled out on a gurney

A neighbor standing in front of Eli hugs her husband

NEIGHBOR 1
Oh my god Are they dead Oh my god

Discreetly Eli takes out Julians phone and without ever putting
it to his ear dials

He continues to watch the crime scene for any reaction when
suddenly a uniformed officer runs out of the house holding a
plastic evidence bag

OFFICER
Detective Claymen Its vibrating

Wearing latex gloves DETECTIVE CLAYMEN a large male in his late
fifties with a mustache grabs the plastic bag removes Elis phone
looks at the caller ID and answers

CLAYMEN
Hello Julian

Eli slowly backs away from the scene and hangs up the phone

Claymen turns to his partner DETECTIVE DUPER a Hispanic man in his
forties

CLAYMEN (CONTD)

Hung up

DUPER
We need to go to campus and find this
kid

Claymen looks at the neighbors standing in small groups Years of
experience and intuition are clearly visible in his eyes as he
scrutinizes the entire scene

( )

Eli is quietly walking away when a song echoes from his pocket-
The freaks come out at night ITS JULIANS RINGTONE

Elis eyes widen as all the attention turns to him He reaches in
his pocket to turn it off but its too late

Having dialed Eli back DETECTIVE CLAYMEN RECOGNIZES HIM FROM THE
PICTURE ON HIS PHONE

CLAYMEN
Thats him

ELI PEDALS AWAY LIKE AN OLYMPIAN THE CHASE IS ON

EXT STREETS AND BACK ALLEYS - NIGHT 51
Eli pedals furiously through the residential neighborhood

He turns back to see police car lights on his tail

Eli veers onto another street desperately looking for an alley He
finds one turns onto it but the cop cars follow Eli exits the
alley onto another street

INT COP CAR - NIGHT 52

Detectives Claymen and Duper are in hot pursuit They watch as Eli
jumps a curve and turns onto another street

DUPER
There he is

He picks up the radio
DUPER (CONTD)
This is unit 22 Were pursuing and
need air support The suspect is on a
bicycle heading south on Devonshire

EXT STREET - NIGHT 53

Weaving in and out of small residential streets Eli pedals as hard
as he can trying desperately to make it back to campus

Then he finally rides by the Michigan Stadium which is covered with
colorful signs for the next days game

EXT U OF M CAMPUS - NIGHT 54

Suddenly more police cars appear ahead joining those already behind
him

More familiar with the campus streets Eli makes a sharp left on
fraternity row where the streets are lined with student cars

( )

Then he makes a quick right into an alley and hides behind a parked
car- The cops drive by without seeing him

Eli knows he has to keep moving and jumps on his bike

He rides through the alley when- A HELICOPTER APPEARS OUT OF NOWHERE
SHINING ITS SPOTLIGHT ON HIM

This time theres nowhere to hide The light is too bright and to
make matters worse THE PATROL CARS RETURN TO THE CHASE

Eli pedals hard turns from one alley to the next finally rounding
the side of a fraternity house

Still at the center of the spotlight Eli rides right into a crowded
backyard party knocking over drinks and drunken students Most of
whom stare up at the helicopter lights

Having lost the cop cars Eli is still followed by the spotlight and
cant seem to shake the chopper- He has no choice but to ride back
through town towards the wilderness

But the cop cars rejoin the chase once again and Eli is close to
exhaustion

EXT U OF M MEDICAL CENTER - NIGHT 55

He rides through the U of M Medical center and circles around the
large building to the back The patrol cars follow as he veers off
onto a grassy athletic field

If he doesnt find a way off the grass its only a matter of
seconds before he gets caught Then he sees a THIN DIRT PATH
THROUGH SOME TREES AT THE END OF THE FIELD

Eli grinds his teeth and pedals as hard as he can- He turns into the
forest path forcing the cops to stop in a cloud of dust

Claymen waves for the other cars to go around and watches as the
helicopter follows Eli into the thick forest He takes out Elis
cell phone and dials it again

EXT FOREST - NIGHT 56

Eli takes Julians ringing phone out of his pocket and throws it
into a passing bush

With the spotlight barely making it through the trees Eli puts on
the night vision goggles using them to maneuver But every time a
flash of the spotlight gets through the trees it creates a blinding
effect in the night vision goggles

( )

Eli is relentless and finally the helicopter loses him in the
dense vegetation He looks back to see the helicopter going in the
wrong direction

But when he turns back to the dirt path- HE SLAMS HEAD FIRST INTO A
THICK BRANCH

CUT TO BLACK
EXT FOREST - MORNING 57
Eli wakes up with a bloodied and bruised forehead A few feet away a
deer stares at him frozen among the trees Contrary to last nights
chaos all is peaceful now
But as Eli sits up the deer is startled and runs away

His goggles are next to him on the ground- shattered to pieces

ELI
Great

using a wet towel to remove the dried blood from his forehead

INT STARBUCKS - MORNING 60
Eli walks out of the restroom and keeping his head down stands in

stares into space realizing he is utterly alone He leans forward
resting his head on the steering wheel and cries quietly- a broken
man

Suddenly he lifts his head and looks into the rearview mirror
Outside the car there is nothing but darkness and silence

He puts the car into drive and takes off He checks the rearview
mirror again Is someone following him or is he just paranoid

He turns down a street with brighter street lamps And then he sees
it- The BMW turns onto the same street

Eli turns again and the BMW follows

Turning onto a busier street Eli watches the BMW on his tail Ina
decisive move he speeds towards an intersection and as the light
turns yellow he accelerates

The light turns red and Eli flagrantly burns it

In the rearview mirror he watches the BMW accelerate through the red
light as well Now he knows for certain hes being followed

diagnosed with ASPD or Anti-Social
Personality Disorder

INT DELTA DELTA DELTA SORORITY HOUSE - AFTERNOON

At the sorority house the girls listen to the same program where DR

SIMMS a greying psychologist and an expert in profiling gives his

evaluation of Eli

DR SIMMS (TV)
The combination of losing his
father to alcoholism at such a young
age and his mothers consequent
substance abuse made it practically

INT DETROIT HOUSE - EVENING

Elis Mom sits in the dark as she watches the same show Drowning
her pain in a bottle of vodka she is completely numb to the words

she hears

DR SIMMS
For Eli its been a long steady
progression of criminal acts which
probably started with rape cruelty to
animals and eventually led him to
murder

INT LARRYS PAWNSHOP - EVENING 100

Larry packs Elis stolen goods into a bag as he watches the show
from his shop

prepares for his crimes very carefully
and chooses his victims according to a
specific criteria

HOST (TV)
So why is he doing this Doctor

HOUSE- BASEMENT - NIGHT 101

With empty fast food boxes and soda cans spread about the basement
its clear Eli has not left this hiding place for the last couple

days

DR SIMMS (TV)
Subconsciously I believe he is
attempting to exercise revenge and
punish the society who ruined his
family and caused the death of his
father

He watches the same show everyones been watching with disbelief

Its amazing

DR SIMMS (CONTD)
-»- No longer willing to be the victim
his parents were Eli probably has a
strong desire to be successful while
at the same time embodies a profound
hatred for the wealthy This paradox
can often result in a total lack of
empathy for those around him
especially his victims

how deep and how twisted the situation has become

ANCHORMAN
If anyone comes in contact with The
Campus Killer make sure to stay clear
and call 911 immediately

The Campus Killer Really Thats just
great

Deep in thought he glares up at the ceiling with the book he stole
from Barnes and Noble resting open on his chest The title- Cold
Turkey Planet Breaking Western Oil Addiction by Professor Harold
Schmidt PhD

In fact he is surrounded by books- all written by Professor
Schmidt

Suddenly a knocking sound startles him He quickly stands and walks
up the basement stairs

Cracking the door open he looks through to the kitchen where an OLD
WOMAN fills a cats bowl with food

OLD NEIGHBOR
Dont you worry Mommy and Daddy will
be home next week You eat up and Ill
see you tomorrow
EXT SCHMIDT HOUSE - MORNING 102

The commotion which had previously surrounded the house has been

INT SCHMIDT HOUSE - MORNING 103

Jones enters the house through the kitchen door The house carries
with it an ominous dark feeling

Walking through the living room he looks around and then heads up
the stairs

Charlotte Lambert

Both women turn to find Jones holding his detective badge

CHARLOTTE

Ive already talked to the police
JONES

You spoke with Homicide Im with

Robbery
She understands his connection to the case Jones takes notice

JONES (CONTD)
Have you talked to him since that
night

CHARLOTTE
No

JONES
No contact whatsoever What do you

I dont know But I cant imagine him
killing anyone He may be a liar anda
thief but hes not a killer

JONES
A thief

CHARLOTTE

JONES

You said he was a thief

( )

She backpedals

CHARLOTTE
I dont know youre with Robbery

Charlotte starts walking away when Jones continues

JONES
You want to hear what I think Maybe
you can tell me if it fits I think
Eli is responsible for a whole string
of burglaries that started when he
enrolled at school

Charlotte listens closely

JONES (CONTD)
I think Eli was robbing that house and
by coincidence saw something he wasnt
supposed to He panicked left his
phone behind and all of a sudden hes
the prime suspect Does that sound
about right

Charlotte is relieved but still reserved about opening up
JONES (CONTD)
Homicide is under a lot of pressure to
bring him in This college does not
need a serial killer on the loose and
they11 do anything to catch him

CHARLOTTE
What do you care anyway

JONES
Lets just say I know what it feels
like when no one believes you

Charlotte thinks but doesnt know who to trust anymore

Sorry I cant help you

DUPER
This is Donald Jones The new guy in
Robbery

JONES
I think hes been breaking into houses
around here for at least a year now

CLAYMEN

JONES
Why would he start killing his victims
now

DUPER

Because he got caught and didnt want
to leave witnesses

JONES

But he doesnt have a history of
violence

( )

CLAYMEN
How do you explain the second victim
Professor Freedman

Jones doesnt have an answer

JONES
I checked all the evidence and in the
other robberies the one thing thats
been missing from every house was a
single silver spoon

The cops cant believe what theyre hearing One of them cant even
keep a straight face

CLAYMEN
Right Weve got a serial killer to
catch

112 EXT U OF M LIBRARY - DAY 112
Aaron watches the police cars flying by with their lights on A
small smile of satisfaction comes on his face as he removes his

student ID card from his wallet and enters the library

But when he swipes his card into the turnstile- The name Eli Burns
flashes on the control screen and AN ALARM GOES OFF

Aaron looks around in confusion when TWO SECURITY GUARDS JUMP HIM
AND TACKLE HIM TO THE GROUND

Just a few turnstiles away totally unnoticed Eli slips into the

library using Aarons student ID card HE SWITCHED THE CARDS IN THE
CAFETERIA

( )

He turns back to Aaron who is forcefully restrained on the ground

ELI
(to himself)
Ouch Thats gonna leave a mark

INT U OF M LIBRARY- RESEARCH CENTER - DAY 113

Using Aarons library card like a credit card he swipes it through
a computer unlocking the database

He types in- Professor Harold Schmidt- when a series of articles
appear- University of Michigan Solar Car Wins National Award Five
Years in a Row and Alternative Fuel Nation and many more

A couple of students walk by and Eli lowers his head He waits for
them to pass and continues reading headlines-

Tackling the Fuel Cell Scientist Talks with Committee On Energy and
Commerce At the bottom of that article Schmidt is in a photograph
with a group of politicians-

Then another article UM Alumni Against Globalization- A picture
shows him picketing with other students

ELI
He graduated from here

Eli walks to another section of the library He looks through a row
of books with dates on them until he finds one from 1968- Its an
old yearbook

He flips through the pages and finds a student picture of Schmidt
Looking deeper he finds a picture of the baseball team and finds
Schmidt among the players

In another picture he sees Schmidt at an anti-war rally with his
arm around another student- JOHN MCMAHON The name sounds familiar
He flips back to the baseball team and finds that McMahon is also in
this picture standing next to Schmidt

ELI (CONTD)
Why do I know this name

He looks up from the yearbook and notices students trying very hard
not to stare at him Eli knows hes been recognized

He quickly walks back to the data base and types in JOHN MCMAHON
The result is eye opening to say the least- John McMahon is a
Senator from Michigan

He returns to the article with the photo of Schmidt and the

politicians- SURE ENOUGH PROFESSOR SCHMIDT AND SENATOR MCMAHON
STAND NEXT TOGETHER-

( )

ELI (CONTD)

Theyve known each other since
college

He wants to continue but he can feel its time to go

Eli walks away from the computer when he notices a security guard
and turns the other way

He quickens his pace while feeling the intense gazes and pressure
coming from all around Another security guard appears and Eli
breaks into a light jog And finally-

STUDENT 1
Its him Its Eli Burns

STUDENT 2
Hes got a gun

But what was tension a second ago has turned to panic and the
students scream and duck under tables

Eli now runs towards the exit when he sees the campus police coming
through the doors

He runs the other way and jumps over a table before running through
some aisles

Passing by rows and rows of books Eli turns a corner down a hallway
but its crowded with students

The police approach and ELI DUCKS UNDER A TABLE KICKS SOME CHAIRS
AND COMES OUT ON THE OTHER SIDE

He runs back through another series of aisles and sees he is being
chased from all directions

Finally he jumps through the door leading to the basement

114 INT U OF M LIBRARY BASEMENT - DAY 114
He climbs down the stairs- The security guards follow
Running as fast as he can through the narrow hallways ELI THROWS
DOWN PILES OF BOXES AND BOOK SHELVES CREATING OBSTACLES and slowing
down his pursuers
He turns into the familiar room with the basement window runs to

it and starts climbing feverishly when- ONE OF THE SECURITY GUARDS
GRABS HIS LEG

EXT U OF M LIBRARY - DAY 115

Eli is halfway out of the basement window clawing at the grass for
leverage

He kicks repeatedly until HIS FOOT LANDS ON THE SECURITY GUARDS
FACE SENDING HIM FLYING BACK INTO THE ROOM

Eli pulls himself out runs past the bike and turns the corner
Another guard runs down the street but Eli has disappeared

ELI HANGS ONTO THE SIDE OF A BUS AND RIDES AWAY FROM EVERYONE

EXT DIAG SQUARE - EVENING 116
Trying not to get noticed Eli pins a cryptic note next to the
hundred others on the same message board Charlotte had visited a few
days earlier

EXT COMPUTER SCIENCE BUILDING - EVENING 117
A newspaper article shows a picture of Senator McMahon smiling and
shaking hands with a factory worker The title reads- McMahon to

Eli lowers the newspaper to see Julian walking with a group of
students before splitting off by himself

ELI
Hey Julian

Eli sticks the wire cutter handle into his back surprising Julian

JULIAN
Oh Hey wait Oh god is that a gun

ELI

Eli forces Julian into an empty classroom

Eli looks outside until the hall is finally clear
JULIAN

Oh thank god

INT PROFESSOR SCHMIDTS OFFICE - NIGHT
Eli closes the door and turns on a desk lamp

At first glance the office seems undisturbed Julian and Eli look

around- There are file cabinets books and a chalkboard with faded

formulas

JULIAN
Hey he ran the Solar Car Program
They won that cross country race last
year

ELI
The American Solar Challenge Five
times in a row

JULIAN
Theres his computer

Julian sits at the desk while Eli scans the walls which are covered

with degrees awards and photographs

ELI
This guy spent his life studying
alternative energy Wind geothermal
hydrogen He was looking for the next
best thing

JULIAN
That probably pissed somebody off

ELI
(sarcastically)
You think

While Julian checks the wiring on the professors computer-

( )

Eli stops in front of an autographed picture on the wall Its
Professor Schmidt and Senator McMahon at a baseball game standing
next to a baseball player in uniform This picture is from the
1980s

JULIAN
This computer is burnt out I cant
even start it

Eli suddenly reacts by turning off the light

ELI
Shhhh

Julian freezes Someone outside the door is trying to get in
ELI (CONTD)
(whispering)
Hide Under the desk
JULIAN
(whispering)

Oh no Shit Shit

ELI
Quiet

Eli gets behind the door and waits Julian is terrified
They both watch as the door cracks open and a man slowly enters

But before he can close the door ELI GRABS HIM AND STICKS THE WIRE
CUTTERS HANDLE IN HIS BACK

ELI (CONTD)
(aggressively)
Put your hands against the wall Put
your hands against the wall

INTRUDER
OK OK Dont kill me please

Julian watches from beneath the desk in awe as Eli pats the man
down and finds nothing

ELI
Looking for me

INTRUDER
No Im not looking for anyone

Eli slams the intruder against a wall Julian has never seen his
friends violent side

( )

ELI

Who do you work for huh Are you
following me

INTRUDER
No one No I dont know you Please
I dont know anything

Eli sees that the guy is genuinely scared

ELI

Why are you breaking into this office
INTRUDER

Eli turns on the lights and finds a young guy his age who finally
registers Elis face

INTRUDER (CONTD)
Its you

ELI
What about it

INTRUDER
You didnt do it Did you

ELI
Who are you

INTRUDER
My name is Sanders Jeremy Sanders I
worked for Professor Leland at the
University of Toronto

Julian who is still under the desk listens attentively

JEREMY
- He and Schmidt were working on the
same thing and

ELI
And

JEREMY
- Two weeks ago Leland was out
walking his dog when he was found dead
sitting under a tree

Julian appears from under the desk He and Jeremy acknowledge each
other

( )

JEREMY (CONTD)
They said he had a heart attack
But when I got to the lab the next
day all his work was gone Computers
notes everything

Eli and Julian look at each other
JEREMY (CONTD)
Im here because I found a letter
from Schmidt in Lelands mail

CUT TO

INT PROFESSOR SCHMIDTS OFFICE - LATER

Eli digs through a file cabinet while Julian and Jeremy search

through every book and stack of paper they can find

JEREMY
All four scientists were working on
the same type of technology And all
four are now dead

JULIAN
What about a paper trail E-mails No
ones making the connection

JEREMY
Only Schmidts letter to Leland I
mean we never thought much about it
at first The guy from Stockholm died
in a random car accident and we
simply lost touch with the Indian
scientist

Frustrated Eli shuts the file cabinet

ELI
Theres nothing here What the hell
does KG stand for

JEREMY
I dont know Schmidt called it the
KG23 He said we should find it if
anything happened to him We all
thought he was just being paranoid

JULIAN
Looks like he had good reason You
think its industrial espionage

( )

JEREMY
Maybe Im sure Professor Leland knew
what it was I thought if I came here
I could find something some clue But
now

Elis mind is reeling He picks up the picture of Schmidt and
McMahon staring at it for a long beat-

ELI
I think I can get to someone who might
know something Can I borrow your car
Julian

Both Jeremy and Julian look up at him

SENATOR MCMAHON (0S)

INT UNITED AUTO WORKERS UNION BUILDING - NIGHT 122

A crowd cheers as Eli removes the hoodie from his head and passes
through metal detectors

SENATOR MCMAHON (0S)
And not for them to build more
factories abroad It was created to
invest our money in our country

Eli sneaks into the back of the large hall where Union members are
gathered listening to Senator McMahons speech

SENATOR MCMAHON (CONTD)
» To invest in the technological
infrastructure required to build the
type of cars that not only Americans
will buy but also that the rest of
world will buy

The crowd of blue collar auto workers cheer McMahon is very
charismatic

SENATOR MCMAHON (CONTD)
And if we build cars that are
technologically advanced that are
energy efficient cars that reduce
green house effects and global
warming whether you believe it exists
or not

The crowd laughs Eli listens thinking maybe McMahon can help

( )

SENATOR MCMAHON (CONTD)
- Then there is no way that any of
our plants should close or that any
of you should ever be out of work Not
now Not ever Thank you and God Bless
Americaand I will see you on voting

day

The crowd applauds as the Senator walks off the stage to shake hands
with the people

Eli slowly makes his way towards the Senator
McMahon shakes a few hands before Eli extends his and connects

SENATOR MCMAHON (CONTD)
Thanks for coming Dont forget to
vote

ELI
Ever hear of a KG23 Senator

SENATOR MCMAHON
I dont think so I dont build cars

(big smile)

But Im grateful for the American

worker who does

ELI
It was something left behind by
Professor Schmidt

The smiling Senator suddenly seems moved

SENATOR MCMAHON
Terrible thing what happened Were you

ELI
Not quite I was there when he died

The Senator smiles again as if he heard nothing and continues
shaking hands

ELI (CONTD)
- Im a witness I saw everything

SENATOR MCMAHON
Not here Meet me outside in twenty
minutes

McMahon walks away in the crowd

EXT UNITED AUTO WORKERS UNION BUILDING - NIGHT 123

Eli stands at a distance as Senator McMahon walks out of the
building towards his idling car Eli starts to walk over to him

Before getting in the car the Senator talks to one of his
bodyguards- Eli cant believe his eyes its THE KILLER

Eli quickly turns into a row of cars ducking down He peeks above
the hood and realizes that the Senator must be directly involved in
this conspiracy

EXT HIDEOUT HOUSE - NIGHT 124

Back at his HIDEOUT Eli lifts up the kitchen window to climb
inside

CHARLOTTE

ELI

He keeps his hand out Charlotte looks around nervously and finally
enters

CHARLOTTE
This was a mistake

INT HIDEOUT HOUSE - NIGHT 125
Eli leads Charlotte through the house to the basement

ELI
Im so glad to see you

CHARLOTTE

She follows him down the stairs
ELI
Because you believe that Im innocent

And now I have proof Sort of

CHARLOTTE
Eli I need to tell you something

But Eli is too agitated
ELI

Wait Hear me out When I was in
Schmidts house

CHARLOTTE
Robbing it
ELI

jumped by the guy who killed him I
saw the same guy tonight talking to
Senator McMahon

CHARLOTTE
Senator who

ELI
McMahon He and Schmidt have been
friends for years and I thought they
might be working together But after
his speech I saw him talking to this
guy who probably killed Professor
Freedman too

CHARLOTTE
How do you know all of this

ELI
Because I also saw him at her
house Theyre trying to make it look
like I killed her too

( )

ELI (CONTD)

I should have never gone to see her
Now shes dead and its all my fault

CHARLOTTE
Eli this all sounds really insane
Youre scaring me

ELI
I dont know how or why yet but
somehow McMahon is implicated in
Schmidts death

CHARLOTTE
A Senator killed Schmidt A US
senator

ELI
Yes Look

Eli reaches into his pocket and removes the picture from Schmidts
office

ELI (CONTD)
This is Schmidt and McMahon years ago
at a ballgame They went to college
here together They were close
friends

Charlotte barely looks at the picture She is more concerned with
Eli who paces back and forth

ELI (CONTD)
(talking to himself)
But why Why would he have anything to
do with his murder Especially if they
needed each other

CHARLOTTE
Eli

He snaps back to reality
CHARLOTTE (CONTD)
You have to turn yourself in Eli
Theres no other way Please
ELI
I will Charlotte I swear But first
I have to find out why they did it
Its obvious she doesnt believe him He points to the photo
ELI (CONTD)

- Its a conspiracy Look at the
picture Charlotte

( ) ELI (CONTD)
All of these people are connected
Plus three of Schmidts colleagues are
also dead

But when he looks down at it something strikes him like a bolt of
lightning Schmidt who stands next to McMahon and the baseball
player is also holding a BASEBALL

ELI (CONTD)

Oh my god
CHARLOTTE
What
ELI
Thats Kirk Gibson
CHARLOTTE
Who
ELI

The baseball player And hes wearing
number 23 KG23

To Charlotte Eli seems crazy as he quickly gathers his gear

ELI (CONTD)
-- Its in the baseball

Out of nowhere- A GUN IS THRUST FROM THE SHADOWS AGAINST HIS CHEEK
ELI IS FROZEN AS JONES REVEALS HIMSELF

JONES
On the floor Nice and easy

ELI
Let her go first Shes got nothing to
do with this Charlotte

JONES
ON THE FLOOR NOW

Eli drops to his knees and gets on his stomach
CLICK His hands immediately are handcuffed

JONES (CONTD)
Ok Charlotte You can go

ELI

( )

JONES

thing
CHARLOTTE

He wants to help you Eli He believes

ELI

CHARLOTTE

She climbs the basement stairs on the verge of tears

ELI
WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT I CAN PROVE
EVERYTHING

JONES
Thats what the police are for

ELI
Yeah A real bang up job you guys are
doing so far

EXT HOUSE - NIGHT

Across the street Charlotte drives away in her car

Jones walks out of the house holding Eli by the arm

But Eli is devastated He was so close and now its the end of the

road

JONES
Trust me Youre lucky I found you
first Shes a good friend

They walk to the unmarked police car and Jones opens the door to the

back seat

JONES (CONTD)
Watch your head If what youre saying
is true then we will get it all
sorted out

Eli sits in the back seat and as Jones closes the door A THIN WIRY
ROPE COMES AROUND HIS NECK AND PRACTICALLY LIFTS HIM OFF THE GROUND

FROM BEHIND

( )

ELI IS STUNNED TO SEE THE KILLER VIOLENTLY STRANGLING JONES RIGHT
OUTSIDE THE WINDOW

ELI
Oh shit
Eli quickly reacts by grabbing for the door handles but his hands
are handcuffed behind his back making it a real challenge Not only
that but in a police car the rear doors can only be opened from the
outside

AS JONES FIGHTS FOR HIS LIFE ELI JUMPS INTO THE FRONT SEAT AND
REACHES FOR THE DOOR BUT ITS ALSO LOCKED

Outside the car The Killer pulls Jones who is losing consciousness
to the ground Inside Eli repeatedly kicks at the passenger window
until IT FINALLY EXPLODES

Unable to use his hands ELI JUMPS OUT OF THE CAR AND LANDS ON THE
PAVEMENT FACE FIRST

Finally Eli runs across the street disappearing between some
houses

EXT STREET - NIGHT 127
Eli walks along the sidewalk staying in the shadows His hands are
cuffed behind his back If the Killer drives by hes a sitting

duck

He sees a set of orange lights at the end of the street and runs

A crew of workers are busy repairing a broken traffic light

Eli carefully walks around their truck looking for a the tool

drawer Using his teeth he opens it and the whole thing falls on

the floor with a loud crash

A worker appears around the corner but Eli is long gone

SNAP On the next street over Eli uses his legs to squeeze a new
pair of cutters breaking the chain connecting the handcuffs

EXT PAWNSHOP - NIGHT 128
Eli slips into the alley adjacent to the pawnshop and looks around
before climbing the side of the building using drainage pipes and

bricks for leverage

Once on the roof he slides off a huge circulating air duct giving
him full access to the pawnshop below

Eli lowers himself into the hole and jumps inside

INT PAWNSHOP - NIGHT

Eli searches though the shop looking in the display cases on the
shelves and through some drawers when- A SHOTGUN IS THRUST FROM

THE SHADOW INTO THE SIDE OF HIS FACE ELI FREEZES

ELI
What would you say if I told you

gun to my head today

LARRY

Keep your hands where I can see them

ELI

Eli moves slowly

ELI

scene into my shop didnt you I

ELI

LARRY

( )

Larry picks up the phone and looks down to dial

IN ONE SWIFT MOVE ELI KNOCKS AWAY THE SHOTGUN GRABS IT FROM LARRY
AND POINTS IT AT HIS HEAD

ELI
(whispering)
Hang up

Larry slowly slides the receiver back on the phone and QUICKLY GRABS
A BASEBALL BAT WIELDING IT UP IN THE AIR

LARRY
You know the deal punk All sales are
final

Its the most uneven Mexican stand-off ever seen

ELI
Larry Ive got a shotgun

LARRY

LARRY SWINGS THE BAT KNOCKING THE SHOTGUN OUT OF ELIS HANDS
THE BASEBALL BAT COMES FLYING AT HIS HEAD ELI DUCKS OUT OF THE WAY

LARRY SWINGS IT DOWN ON ELI WHO NOW ROLLS CLEAR

( )

ELI GRABS AN OLD PAIR OF SHOES AND THROWS THEM AT LARRY-
BUT LARRY KEEPS SWINGING AND ELI KEEPS DUCKING-

WITH EVERY SWING LARRY SMASHES INTO SOMETHING ELSE DESTROYING HIS
SHOP- A GUITAR ON THE WALL A SHELF WITH OLD MOVIE CAMERAS

Eli falls over exhausted Next to him Larry is half-conscious

ELI (CONTD)

ELI

LARRY
Too bad I sold it And youre better

ELI
Dammit Larry Whod you sell it to

Larry smiles Obviously thats a loaded question

EXT RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT 130

A nervous Julian sits inside his car which is parked in a dark
street of an abandoned Detroit neighborhood where the majority of
houses are boarded up or burned down

Somewhere down the block Eli walks across the street to a neglected
building resounding with the beat of Hip-hop music

ELI
Are you for real

From behind a bush Eli studies the house looking inside at its
occupants Three gangster thugs sit on a couch drinking beers

Staying off the property he moves around the fence to the back of
the house The high grass keeps him from getting a clear view
inside but it looks like there are more people in a back room

Eli is about to jump over the fence when A LARGE PITBULL JUMPS UP
AGAINST IT AND BARKS LIKE A FEROCIOUS ANIMAL

Alerted by the animal one of the thugs exits the house holding a
gun

Eli watches through the grass as the man inspects the surroundings
making his way towards the barking dog

THUG 1
Shut up you dirty mutt

And without hesitation kicks the animal in the gut silencing it
instantly

He leashes the dog and fastens the other end to a pole in the yard

THUG 1 (CONTD)
Now keep it shut You hear

The man steps back into the house cursing to his friends about the
neighborhood raccoons

Eli jumps over the fence and crouches under a window The dog looks
at him whimpering too afraid to bark again

Looking through the window the first thing Eli sees is A COUPLE
HAVING SEX ON A BED He looks further into the room and notices a
shelf dedicated to baseball memorabilia- bats gloves and HIS
BASEBALL

But getting it back will not be so easy especially when he sees

there is a gun on the night table next to a small mound of white
powder They are all coked up and packing

( )

Eli moves around to the kitchen door and sees someone at the
refrigerator Its another thug who grabs more beers and heads back
to the living room Eli now knows there are at least five people in
the house

He finally builds up the nerve to enter
INT THUG KITCHEN - NIGHT 131

Sneaking in Eli carefully closes the door behind him The music is
blasting but he can still hear the three guys in the front room
talking above it

With its torn wallpaper and dirty floors the house is more like a
squat than a home

He finds the door to the bedroom ajar but for him to have access he
will have to pass through the hallway next to the living room One
of the thugs sits very close to the hallway and would only have to
turn his head to see Eli

INT THUG HALLWAY - NIGHT 132
Eli goes for it and quickly moves into the bathroom facing the
bedroom Through a crack in the door he keeps an eye on the thug on

the couch waiting for an opportunity to pass by

The thug leans over the coffee table to snort some cocaine and Eli
makes his move

He walks quietly down the hall grabs the doorknob takes a deep
breath and enters

INT THUG BEDROOM - NIGHT 133
Eli stands by the door evaluating the situation The bedroom is
divided down the middle with the shelving unit containing the
memorabilia On the other side of the shelf the couple is in full
action

If he is careful and stays on his side he can grab the baseball
without getting noticed

He steps deeper into the room and slowly approaches the shelves
Just a few more feet and the ball will be his A step later he is
close enough to read the small gold plaque on the plexiglass case-

KIRK GIBSON 23

The couple gets very loud as the girl starts to climax Eli takes
this opportunity and grabs the baseball but-

AS HE LIFTS IT OFF THE SHELF THE MOANING GIRL OPENS HER EYES AND
SPOTS ELI STANDING ON THE OTHER SIDE SHE SCREAMS

( )

The man turns and with a reflex GRABS HIS GUN AND FIRES A COUPLE
OF SHOTS AT ELI DESTROYING THE SHELVES SEPARATING THEM

INT THUG HALLWAY KITCHEN- NIGHT 134

Miraculously escaping the bedroom Eli now finds himself facing
three armed thugs Instantly THEY FIRE THEIR WEAPONS

ELI SWINGS THE BATHROOM DOOR OPEN AND USING IT AS A SHIELD DIVES
INTO THE KITCHEN FOR COVER

In the hall The Thugs have taken cover and look into kitchen

The gunfire subsides and the music is now off The only sounds are
of the girl crying

THUG 1
(yelling to the bedroom)
You all right Vince

VINCE (0S)
That bitch stole my baseball

THUG 1
Your baseball

Thug 3 turns to Thug 1
THUG 3
(whispering)

I think I left my gun in the kitchen

THUG 1
What

Back in the kitchen crouching with his back to the wall Eli spots
Thug 3s revolver on the kitchen table

He picks it up and uses the handle of the gun to crack open the
plexiglass casing round the ball

Meanwhile the girl continues crying from the bedroom
VINCE (0S)
Dammit girl Why dont you shut your
damned mouth Im trying to think
Hidden in the base of the casing Eli discovers A SMALL USB KEY
VINCE (0S) (CONTD)
I dont know who you are but youre

not getting out of here alive You
hear me

( )

Vince opens the bedroom door and creeps out of the hallway in his
underwear quietly pointing for the thugs to follow him

In the kitchen Eli grips the gun tightly in anticipation

All four men slide against the walls with their guns pointed when-
THE BASEBALL ROLLS OUT FROM THE KITCHEN AND STOPS AT THEIR FEET

They look at each other not knowing what to do
EXT THUG HOUSE - NIGHT 135

Eli runs past a window and into the street where Julians car
screeches around the corner

He dives into the window and the car takes off into the night
INT JULIANS CAR - NIGHT 136
The USB key is now plugged into the side of a lap top

Julian drives while Eli looks at a technical blueprint on the
computer screen They listen to Jeremy Sanders on speaker phone

JEREMY SANDERS (0S)
Apparently it replaces the platinum
element needed to create hydrogen
combustion with a combination of
nickel and a biological enzyme Its
an ingenious concept that would give
the same results and finally make
hydrogen engines affordable

JULIAN
-- and make oil obsolete

JEREMY SANDERS (0S)
Not only oil If it works it wouldnt
make sense to build any other type of
engine Hybrid electrical theyd all
become useless

ELI
Schmidt designed an engine worth
millions

JEREMY SANDERS (0S)
Try billions Were talking about
possibly revamping the entire auto

industry

JULIAN
Im scared that I even know about
this

( )

Julian stops

They hang up

Listening to

JEREMY SANDERS (0S)
Anyone who youve talked to about it
could be in danger

the car in front of the police station

ELI

JEREMY SANDERS (0S)

and Eli quickly dial again

JULIAN
Ok were here Lets go inside

ELI

Hey Its Eli Listen to me You have
to meet me at the police station Im

the phone his expression changes

ELI (CONTD)
Who is this

Julian becomes concerned as Eli flips to speaker phone

THE KILLER (0S)
We need to have a little talk Eli

ELI
If you hurt her I swear I will hunt
you down

THE KILLER (0S)
Spare me the dramatic teenage hero
routine Accidents can happen Its a
tragic fact of life

ELI

( )

ELI
A certain blueprint that might be of
interest to a few people Important

THE KILLER (0S)

137 EXT ANN ARBOR - NEXT DAY 137

Its game day in Ann Arbor The streets are busy and everyone wears
blue or yellow Its hard to tell one student from the next

138 INT U OF M STADIUM - DAY 138
Inside the stadium its kick-off time The bands are playing the
cheerleaders bounce up and down and the action on the field is

reminiscent of roman gladiators- SLAM CRACK BOOM

Eli watches the game from under his hoodie He looks through the
stadium for any sign of Charlotte

TOUCHDOWN MICHIGAN SCORES AND THE STADIUM ERUPTS Eli looks at the
replay on the giant monitor

When he looks back down A MAN is sitting in the empty seat next to
him

ELI
Someone is sitting here

THE MAN
Lift up your shirt

Eli sees the man holding a gun and lifts his shirt showing hes not
packing or bugged

ELI
Who are you Wheres Charlotte

He hands Eli a pair of binoculars

THE MAN
Forty yard line

Eli looks at the players on the field until he finds the 40 yard
line He moves up to the bleachers and finally sees Charlotte
sitting next to The Killer who wears an Ohio State T-shirt and holds
a huge foam finger to Charlottes head

( )

ELI
(to himself)
Nice shirt loser

Eli turns to The Man next to him who wears a secret service
earpiece

ELI (CONTD)
Whats in the foam finger

But The Man is not here for conversation

ELI (CONTD)
What about the money

THE MAN
Youll get it when I get what I want

ELI
You dont even know what youre
looking for

The Man is as cold as ice A machine

THE MAN
Whatever it is youre gonna hand it
over

ELI

Its not on me Its under one of
these seats

The Man looks around the stadium which seats over a hundred thousand
spectators

THE MAN
(into a mic)
He doesnt have it Under a seat

ELI
Who are you talking to

THE MAN
You have ten seconds or the deal is
off

ELI

Who are you talking to McMahon
The man looks at his watch

THE MAN
Five seconds

( )

Everywhere Eli looks he sees older guys with earpieces and
sunglasses Is he being paranoid or is he totally surrounded

THE MAN (CONTD)

(into the mic)

He stands

ELI

The Man looks down at Eli His eyes stern and determined

THE MAN
- The seat number

ELI

THE MAN
(into the mic)

ELI
Now let her go

THE MAN

EXT U OF M STADIUM - CONTINUOUS

In front of the stadium police cars arrive at the gate

Detectives Claymen and Duper exit their vehicle followed by other

officers
INT U OF M STADIUM - CONTINUOUS

A sign reading SECTION 23 is seen through The Mans binoculars

Below it someone who looks like a fan moves briskly among the crowd

looking for Row W

ELI
Who are you Auto industry Oil

But The Man is unmovable

ELI (CONTD)
CIA Secret Service

The crowd cheers loudly at the game

( )

ELI (CONTD)
Judging by the way you take orders
you probably have military training
Blackwater
INT U OF M STADIUM - CONTINUOUS 141

Claymen looks at the thousands of people in the stands Its like
finding a needle in a haystack

He looks down at the field where the quarterback throws an
incomplete pass

INT U OF M STADIUM - CONTINUOUS 142
Eli and The Man watch the same play from their seats

ELI
Youre trained like a good little dog
arent you Always doing what hes
told

The Man returns to the binoculars Across the stadium the fan
finally turns into Row W

ELI (CONTD)
- Never questioning his master You
ever hear the word fascist

The Man finally cracks a smile through his clenched jaw

ELI (CONTD)
Guess not I forget that you military
types cant afford an education
Thats why youre so easily
manipulated

Meanwhile the fan searching for Elis package quickly moves along
the seats forcing students to stand as he passes

ELI (CONTD)
- Believing that bullshit about
making the ultimate sacrifice for your
country Its a joke

The Man has no response or emotion

ELI (CONTD)
- Youre no different than a
terrorist

Still nothing

( )

ELI (CONTD)
- Im sure your father must be very
proud

That was it-

THE MAN
Youre god damned right hes proud
Who the fuck are you What have you
ever done

ELI
I dont kill people for a living
Thats for sure

THE MAN
No You have people like me do it You
have no clue what its like to fight
for something greater than yourself
do you

ELI
Schmidt did and you killed him He
was a true patriot He was fighting
for this country with a real purpose
Not like you

THE MAN
Schmidt was a traitor Do you have any
idea how many American lives we saved
by getting him out of the way Of
course not

Wow That sure sounded like a confession

Finally across the stadium the fan reaches under a seat and comes
up with an envelope

The Man listens through his earpiece

THE MAN (CONTD)
Get up

ELI
What about Charlotte

Eli stands

THE MAN
(into the mic)
Were moving
(to Eli)
Just keep quiet and walk

( )

Hiding the gun he pushes Eli through the row of students

SUDDENLY THE CROWD CHEERS AS THE WOLVERINES SCORE ANOTHER
TOUCHDOWN

The Man is caught offguard and ELI REACHES FOR THE GUN

THEY STRUGGLE AND TRIP TUMBLING DOWN THE STAIRS EACH TRYING TO GET
CONTROL OF THE WEAPON UNTIL-

BANG The gun goes off but no one hears it through the noise and
cheers Instead Eli runs away holding the bloody gun He runs up
the stairs as fast as he can

The Man falls on a female student before painfully standing up with
a gunshot wound to his stomach

Sweating and holding his gut he walks up the stairs

THE MAN (CONTD)
(into mic)
He got away Son of a bitch has my
gun

Further away Eli puts the gun under his sweatshirt and runs through
a sea of students looking left and right

In total panic he knows he has just a few minutes to find her
before its too late

He rushes towards the other side of the stadium looking everywhere
slamming into students and running past a row of concession stands
until- HE FINALLY SEES HER THROUGH THE CROWD

But The Killer pulls her further away and as the crowd thickens
they will both soon disappear

In an act of desperation Eli pulls the gun out and shoots up into
the air- BANG BANG

EVERYONE SCREAMS AND HITS THE DECK INCLUDING CHARLOTTE LEAVING ELI
AND THE KILLER IN A STAND OFF ELI POINTS THE GUN WHILE THE KILLER
HOLDS THE FOAM FINGER AT CHARLOTTES HEAD

ELI
LET HER GO

But Eli doesnt see the police officer behind him pointing his gun
at him

OFFICER

(to Eli)
DROP IT DROP IT NOW

( )

ELI
NO ITS HIM THERES A GUN IN THAT
FINGER

OFFICER

I SAID DROP THE GUN I WILL SHOOT YOU

Eli slowly lowers the gun and watches helplessly as The Killer pulls
Charlotte away blending back into the crowd

Claymen and Duper run through the crowd catching up with the
officer

Eli stands with his hand above his head when HE SUDDENLY TAKES OFF

CLAYMEN
DONT SHOOT

Claymen and Duper run past the officer

CLAYMEN (CONTD)
Too many kids Secure the exits

Meanwhile Eli runs through the crowd looking for Charlotte He
turns left right runs a few yards and stops again- but cant see
her anywhere- until he hears a faint voice calling his name

He turns and spots her disappearing down a flight of stairs He runs
through the crowd KNOCKING OVER A STUDENT WITH A TRAY OF SODAS

The student recognizes him

STUDENT
Its The Campus Killer

Eli gets up just in time to see Charlotte being pulled into a
service door He runs-

ELI
CHARLO

SLAM ELI IS TACKLED BY A SECURITY OFFICER THEY STRUGGLE ON THE
GROUND WHEN ELI BITES HIS HAND THE GUARD SCREAMS ELI KICKS HIM IN
THE GUT AND GRABS HIS NIGHTSTICK

A COUPLE OF STUDENTS TRY TO HELP THE SECURITY GUARD BUT ELI JUMPS
UP SWINGING THE NIGHTSTICK

Everyone backs away and Eli runs towards the service door
143 INT U OF M STADIUM UNDERGROUND - DAY 143

Eli enters a long corridor running straight through to the stadiums
underbelly

( )

Further away The Killer pulls Charlotte violently into the
underground maze with thick metallic pipes running along the walls

But Eli worked at the stadium all summer and knows these tunnels
like the back of his hand

He passes a series of metal doors and turns a corner when- BANG A
BULLET STRIKES THE WALL ABOVE HIS HEAD ELI DUCKS AND JUMPS BACK
BEHIND THE WALL

Charlotte struggles with the Killer when he punches her in the face
instantly bloodying her nose Now using her as a shield he walks
towards Eli

KILLER
What are you gonna do Eli Throw that
stick at me

He slowly approaches Eli pointing the gun at the wall

KILLER (CONTD)
Beat me to death with it

All of a sudden THE NIGHTSTICK COMES FLYING AT THE KILLER FORCING
HIM TO DUCK BANG HE FIRES AGAIN

KILLER (CONTD)
You need to be careful Eli You
couldve hurt your girlfriend

The Killer approaches with the gun in one hand Charlotte bleeds
from her nose as he grips her arm tightly

But as he slowly rounds the corner ELI IS GONE

KILLER (CONTD)
Eli

SLAM ELI HITS THE KILLER FROM BEHIND KNOCKING THE GUN OUT OF HIS
HANDS

Exhausted Charlotte falls to the ground while the two men fight
like banshees throwing fists knees and head butts

But Eli is enraged and fights not only to save himself and his
girlfriend but to avenge all of those people who were murdered

ELI JUMPS ON TOP OF THE KILLER AND BEATS HIM WITH A FLURRY OF
PUNCHES- IN A FLASH THE KILLER UNSHEATHES A KNIFE AND SWINGS IT
ACROSS ELIS CHEST BARELY MISSING HIS NECK

Eli falls back and the Killer jumps on top of him He lifts his
knife to swing a final deadly blow when- BANG

( )

A BULLET RIPS THROUGH THE KILLERS NECK He falls to the ground
clutching his wound and revealing Charlotte holding the smoking gun

Both Eli and Charlotte are in complete shock when-

CLAYMEN
DROP IT CHARLOTTE DROP THE GUN

The cops enter the underground corridor

DUPER

Eli lifts his bloody hands and looks down at the killer who stares
right back at him- bleeding to death

144 INT U OF M STADIUM - CONTINUOUS 144

dealing with the consequences

145 EXT ANN ARBOR POLICE DEPARTMENT - NIGHT 145
Back at the opening scene- FLASH FLASH

Handcuffed Eli walks through a crowd of journalists and
photographers trying to hide his identity under the hoodie of his
Michigan football sweatshirt

ELI (VO)
- I used to think that who you are
is determined by what you have how
much money you make what kind of
clothes you wear or what kind of car
you drive

146 INT ANN ARBOR POLICE DEPARTMENT - NIGHT 146

Eli is led through the police station while the other officers stop
to catch a glimpse of the captured student

ELI (VO)
Professor Freedman was right
Youre never too young to learn or too
old to change I know now that whether
you grew up fighting in the streets
or with a silver spoon in your
mouth

INT CENTRAL BOOKING - EVENING 147

The officers walk Eli in front of a police camera to take his mug
shot when one of them removes the hoodie covering his head

ELI
-» Or whether you got your education
behind bars or have fancy degrees from
Harvard or Yale The only thing you
truly ever have Is your name your
integrity your honor

But this time as Eli looks straight into the lens THE SOUND OF A
CROWD CHEERING ERUPTS

THE MAN (PLAYBACK)
» You have no clue what its like to
fight for something greater than
yourself do you

FLASH
INT U OF M STADIUM - DAY 148
Back on the sideline Julian listens to his headphones sitting next
to a crew of cameramen The long distance audio recorder he used to
peep on coeds is at his feet
ELI (PLAYBACK)

Schmidt did and you killed him He

was a true patriot He was fighting

for this country with a purpose
He listens to his latest recording on his laptop passing the audio
through filters removing the cheering crowd until finally the sound
is perfect

THE MAN (PLAYBACK)

- Schmidt was a traitor You have no

idea how many American lives we saved

by getting him out of the way do you
JULIAN RECORDED EVERYTHING and burns the proof Eli needs on a CD
He slides the CD into an envelope ADDRESSED TO DETECTIVE CLAYMEN
INT LIBRARY - DAY 149

A FEW WEEKS LATER

Healed and all cleaned up Eli sits alone at a desk in the library
His head buried in books he is back to his school work

( )

VOICE
Still hard at work I certainly
respect you resilience

Eli looks up- its Senator McMahon in his usual suit and tie

SENATOR MCMAHON
Mind if I sit

Eli returns to his books as McMahon pulls up a chair and sits

SENATOR MCMAHON (CONTD)
I remember my days as a student I
never thought it would end I just
couldnt wait to get out into the
world

ELI
What can I do for you Senator

SENATOR MCMAHON
Well besides for some impressive
homework that little thing had
nothing on it

ELI
What little thing

SENATOR MCMAHON
Come now Do you really think you got
off so easy all on your own I pulled
a lot of strings for you Eli

But Eli doesnt believe him

SENATOR MCMAHON (CONTD)
- Although it was very smart of you
to hold on to it Ill give you that

Eli finally puts his pencil down

ELI
Tying up the loose ends Senator

McMahon smiles

ELI (CONTD)
You know theres still something I
cant put together Why not embrace
Schmidts technology Why suppress it
Why kill people to suppress it

( )
94

SENATOR MCMAHON
I dont know anything about that My
job has always been to keep Americans
safe and warm at night

ELI
-- and employed I heard your speech
about building better cars and keeping
factories open

SENATOR MCMAHON
Thats right

ELI
Then why get rid of Schmidt Why His
invention gave you that

McMahon takes a second to answer

SENATOR MCMAHON
Maybe he was too late

ELI
Too late How can progress ever come
too late

SENATOR MCMAHON
Maybe you dont understand how fragile
and vulnerable an economy can be ina
recession How risky investments
become

Elis face lights up Hes finally putting it together

There it is

ELI
They were invested in something else
Of course They had already spent the
money Schmidts design was better
but it was too late And using it
would mean losing millions of
dollars

SENATOR MCMAHON
-- and Jeopardize millions of
American jobs

Eli finally hears what hes been waiting for
ELI
You couldnt care less about American

workers Youre just protecting
corporate millionaires

( )

SENATOR MCMAHON
Isnt it the same thing Think about
your father

That takes Eli by surprise What about him

SENATOR MCMAHON (CONTD)
- Think about how different your
life wouldve have turned out if
someone helped the company he worked
for instead of letting it go under
Maybe he wouldnt have lost his job
or abandoned you

Thats a cheap shot

SENATOR MCMAHON (CONTD)
Like I said My job is to protect
Americans

ELI
What about Freedman How did she
jeopardize Americans

SENATOR MCMAHON
We both have to accept our share of
the responsibility on that one dont
you think Nobody forced you to become
a thief or end up at her house

Hes right and it stings

SENATOR MCMAHON (CONTD)
» Whats important now is that it
doesnt get into the wrong hands

ELI
Like yours

But McMahon turns very serious He knows more than hes letting on

SENATOR MCMAHON
Do you have any idea how much power
that formula represents Do you want
the Chinese or the Russians to get a
hold of it The Iranians Think about
it Do you want to share it with third
world nations Should we go to war
because you think sharing is playing
nice

ELI
That kind of power should end wars not
start new ones

( )

The Senator cracks showing his true colors

SENATOR MCMAHON
ALTERNATIVE ENERGY IS A WAR
(realizing and whispering)
Grow the fuck up Eli

Eli thinks very carefully before he answers

ELI
I have grown up Finally And youre
right Ive accepted responsibility
for my actions For my part in it
Its time to make things right again
For everyone

Eli closes his books

SENATOR MCMAHON
I am warning you Dont do something
youll regret

This makes Eli smile as he packs his books

ELI
I think everyone in the world should
benefit from Schmidts blueprints
Even third world countries Thats
what he wouldve wanted

SENATOR MCMAHON
Schmidt was a traitor He was gonna
sell it to the highest bidder you
idiot
Eli stands up and pushes the chair against the table

ELI
He was your friend

For the first time the Senator looks stunned

ELI (CONTD)
- I have to go now Time for lunch

Eli walks way from the table towards the library door But this is
not the library hes used to A UNIFORMED GUARD appears on the other
side of the door- ELI IS IN A PRISON LIBRARY
SENATOR MCMAHON
How do you know that whoever you sent
it to will actually get it

Eli turns back to see the senator sitting among the other convicts

( )

SENATOR MCMAHON (CONTD)

Jeremy Sanders How do you know for
sure something wont happen to him

ELI
How do you know hes the only one who
has it
They share a long pause There is nothing else to be said
SENATOR MCMAHON
I guess well just have to take that

risk

ELI
I guess we will

SENATOR MCMAHON
See you in a few months

The door opens and Eli walks out with a smile

SENATOR MCMAHON (CONTD)
- If you make it out

INT PRISON CORRIDOR - DAY 150

Eli walks through the long corridor which is lined with windows
looking onto the library McMahon watches him walk away powerless

But the smile on Elis face disappears as he rejoins the prison
population

Well on his way to repay his debt to society Eli has finally
accepted the errors of his ways and knows his journey to redemption
and respect will be long But his expression is resolute and full of
determination The school boy is finally a man

CUT TO BLACK
