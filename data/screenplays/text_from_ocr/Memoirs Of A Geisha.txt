1 EXT JAPANESE SEACOAST STORMY DAY WIND WINTER

DEAD LEAVES scatter from twisted skeletal trees that toss in
the harsh wind on the cliffs above the waters edge

Below the cliff at the edge of the sea VILLAGE WOMEN gather
fish laid to dry on wooden drying racks The women hurry
trying to escape the storm In the rough waves FISHERMEN
stand and pull in their nets An OX is tethered to a wayward
boat straining to pull it from the angry sea and safely to
shore

Clinging to the edge of the cliff is a tiny ramshackle

lopsided “tipsy house” RAIN starts to batter its broken
shingles Cowering under the eaves a frightened macaque A
home-made windchime bangs tinkling A lantern glows behind

a patched rice-paper door The CAMERA moves inside to the
soft murmur of men speaking in JAPANESE

you wife Sakamoto-san

2 INT TIPSY HOUSE STORM DAY WINTER

etched with pain She opens her eyes briefly to drink a
medicinal tea they are a silver color

In secret her daughters CHIYO (9 clean-limbed delicate)
and SATSU (15 slow earthy) listen behind a make-shift
screen The TWO MEN continue in JAPANESE

TANAKA

your daughters

SAKAMOTO

Without understanding Japanese we still comprehend the grave

situation

In the pelting rain Sakamoto grimly lifts Chiyo into
Tanaka’s wooden cart handing her to Satsu in front Tanaka
takes the reins of the OX Sakamoto lifts his lantern for a

final look as the cart pulls away His old eyes fill with
tears ‘

In Chiyo’s face rainwater and sorrow stream together down
her face The softly accented VOICE of a mature woman
narrates in ENGLISH —

SAYURI’S VOICE

A story like mine should never be
told

Chiyo is jolted about in the back as Tanakas fish-stained
cart rattles over rough road

SAYURI’S VOICE (contd)
For my world is as forbidden as it
is fragile without it’s mysteries
it cannot survive

Low-hanging branches whip the cart Satsu pulls Chiyo close
to guard her from them Tanaka urges the oxen onward

SAYURI‘S VOICE (contd)
My family lived in a tipsy house in
a tiny village called Yoroido on
the Sea of Japan When I was born
my father was already old My
mother said he was like wood as
rooted to the earth as an old
Sakura tree But she and I were
like water Water doesn’t stay in
one place it flows quickly--

The heavy oak wheels carve grooves through the mud In the
driving rain they fill with water which courses in rivulets
across the ground tiny rivers

SAYURIS VOICE cont‘d)
-and when something blocks the way
water makes a new path

A RIVULET veers to one side rather than pass over a stone

stay at the tea-house until dawn
entertaining three Judges--and when
she got home she cried “Im sooo
tired” And then she started--

(PUMPKIN makes a snoring

sound)
--and she knocked over a candle
and it singed her kimono and her
futon started smoking and Mother
came in and said “Pumpkin You
must stay awake all night so
Hatsumomo doesn‘t burn down the
whole okiya”

When I am a geisha I will sleep as
late as I want I will wear a
fancy kimono and my hair will be
in a split-peach

“split peach” Together she and Chiyo giggle

Hatsumomo with a handsome young man KOICHI (30s) With a

smile he pulls her into a clandestine embrace He kisses

her neck and whispers in her ear Hatsumomo dissolves into

Futon and quilts are piled in a tangled heap Grimy white
tabis and old wooden sushi boxes lie strewn among crumpled
tissues and spilled face powder and movie-photo magazines
Chiyo leans down to pick up a box of powder she does not
hear Hatsumomo come in

HATSUMOMO

I can just hear the General now
“Why Hatsumomo You used to smell
of jasmine what’s this new
perfume”

(wrinking her nose in

distaste)
“Blowfish”

(savagely)
I told you never to touch my
things Can‘t you understand why

in stacks along the walls

Under Auntie’s deft folding the exquisite embroidery

disappears and the kimono goes into a red lacquered box
AUNTIE (contd)

A geisha needs an elegant wardrobe

just like an artist needs ink If

she is not properly dressed then

she is not a true geisha

Finally a small panel slides open An OLD CRONE looks out

The panel snaps shut Chiyo beats on the door to no avail

CHIYO (cont’d)
Satsu From Yoroido Satsu

Chiyo stands uncertainly soaked to the skin her hair and
thin kimono plastered to her body She casts around
helplessly and sees

From a dark side doorway a MAN in Western clothes departs
Behind him in the shadows Chiyo can see a young woman her
silhoutte is familiar Chiyo calls

They laughed and turned me away---

Chiyo trembling desperately clings to Satsu as her eyes
fill with tears Satsu pushes her away

chance Once I’ve left I can’t go

Chiyo tries the gate - it slides open

Chiyo hesitates at the entrance of the okiya and then slips
quietly around the side via the narrow passage

In the back garden Chiyo moves covertly toward the kitchen
and the back door - but she hears a NOISE and sees

In the STORAGE ROOM the heavy door has been left ajar

Chiyo hears the rustle of mice burrowing into bags of rice
inside She hastens to close the door --

-- and sees inside the dark room something strange and
fascinating Hatsumomo is lying under a man It is
Hatsumomo’s boyfriend KOICHI (30 handsome) Koichi spies
Chiyo and leaps to his feet —

KOICHI
What is she doing here
HATSUMOMO

Shes seen us

Hatsumomo’s stricken by his words Koichi gropes among the
rice bags for his sash dressing hastily Hatsumomo grabs
Chiyo

HATSUMOMO
Stupid girl

In the okiya a light comes on

HATSUMOMO (contd)
Why have you come back The
perfect chance to escape

They freeze as they hear Taku start barking madly inside
KOICHI finishes pulling on his clothes

HATSUMOMO (cont’d)
Koichi please--

KOICHI
Look at us sneaking around like
criminals-

HATSUMOMO
Koichi don’t--

KOICHI
It’s degrading
They hear hurrying footsteps and Mother’s voice calling

MOTHERS VOICE

Koichi ducks out the side path -- just as Mother and barking

Taku appear at the tatami room door onto the veranda

fast she stuffs the bills inside Chiyo’s kimono Mother--
bamboo stick in hand--halts at the sight of Chiyo and
Hatsumomo in front of the store room Taku is barking into
the dark toward the narrow side path Auntie has come out
in her night kimono

HATSUMOMO
Look Okasan I caught her She
was running away with her sister

Hatsumomo snatches Chiyo’s kimono open Money spills out
Mother whirls on Chiyo and begins beating her

MOTHER
You little thief

Chiyo terrified finally breaks her silence --

CHIYO
No She is lying

HATSUMOMO
--after all we have done for her--

CHIYO
--I saw her with a man--right there
(the “bed” of rice bags)
- His name is Koichi

Mother stops abruptly stares at Hatsumomo seeing the truth

MOTHER
You shut up Take her arms

In the pouring rain Auntie seizes her arms Hatsumomo gives
a startled cry Mother reaches under Hatsumomo’s kimono and
parts her legs Mother withdraws her hand smells her
fingers Hatsumomo chokes back a defiant tear Her face is
crimson Mother slaps Hatsumomo hard making her gasp

MOTHER (cont’d)

loathing

The rain has stopped water drains from the tiled roof and
rushes in the garden’s gutter Chiyo crouches low scouring
the stepping stones She glances at the sundial in the
garden the light slants long across it Its late She
looks anxiously toward the sky and can see the moon
starting to reveal itself on the horizon Night is
approaching

Chiyo rises and her heart swells in her chest it’s time to
make her escape but how She glances to and fro just as
MOTHER passes through the garden and tosses her a
recriminatory look It makes Chiyo cower and she sinks back
down scrubbing the stones with renewed fervor Satisfied
MOTHER disappears

A few drops of water from above fall onto Chiyo’s face She
wipes them away A few more drops fall

She looks up and notices that the water is coming from the
chain of verdigris bells that hang from the gutter With her
eyes she follows the path of the gutter up to--

The roof

Chiyo steps out onto the roof by the water tank She sees
The maze of tiled roofs

Stepping out on her wooden sandal Chiyo tests her weight on
the roof tiles Her wet shoe skids on the rain-slick tiles
and comes out from under her Chiyo falls on her bottom hard
and barely saves herself from tumbling down the slope

Her shoe falls clattering down the tiles and plummeting off
the edge into the garden The noise sets off Taku’s barking
(0S)

Chiyo gathers her courage She takes off her other wooden
shoe and leaves it perched on the ridge of the okiya’s roof

Chiyo inches half sliding down the sloping tiles to the
edge of the roof which is adjacent to the NEXT OKIYA’S roof

Chiyo gathers her courage and jumps --

She falls onto the NEXT OKIYA’S SLOPING ROOF Her bare
feet slip and scramble for purchase Then herfingers grip
the wet tiles and one foot wedges safely against a tile

Chiyo scrambles across the roof and swings her legs over the
ridge cap She slowly lets herself skid down the low slope

and at the bottom and sees A gap between her and NEXT OKIYA Taku‘s barking sounds farther away

Chiyo crouches at the edge her toes curling over the tiles’

edge She pushes off drops to the NEXT ROOF catches
her balance Safe

Chiyo clambers up this even steeper slope Hand over
hand she climbs to the top she seems to be gaining
strength Her hand grasps the cap tiles The tiles hold

Chiyo reaches up with her other hand Now both hands safely
grip the cap tiles Her fingers tighten as she hauls herself
up She can see the NEXT OKIYA’S ROOF and beyond that
the tangle of electrical wires on a pole and red lanterns in
the street -- Freedom

The cap tiles give way with a clatter Chiyo skids
helter-skelter down the long wet slope of the roof She
screams - ‘

MOTHER

Who can I send you home to

Mother goes to her tansu and takes out a cloth-wrapped
object She unwraps two black lacquered tablets with gold
letters Chiyo recognizes them at once

MOTHER (contd)
These came weeks ago from Mr
Tanaka

Mother leaves them Auntie picks up the accompanying letter

AUNTIE
“Dear Satsu and Little Chiyo As
one who was once an orphaned child
myself this humble person is sorry
to inform you that six weeks after

Chiyos face fills with tears

feels confident both your honored
parents have found their places in
paradise”

Chiyo picks up each tablet in turn clasping them tightly to
her breast

for a maid--

But Chiyo

Just think how she would enrich
your okiya

faster than a maid

Chiyo whispers to Pumpkin incredulous

CHIYO
Are they really talking about me
») Pumpkin nods equally stunned Meanwhile

MOTHER
I would never question the great
Mameha But you could choose
anyone in the Hanamachi--

MAMEHA
You flatter me truly--

MOTHER
--Id give you my Pumpkin if she
were not already tied to Hatsumomo--

MAMEHA
--please I would never dream of
asking--

MOTHER
Besides I can always sell Chiyo to
Mrs Tatsuyo

But with your eye for beauty and
your nose for talentsurely you
can see what a terrible waste that
would be

If you were not the kind-hearted
geisha I know you to bethen I
might think you were dishonest

Oh

MOTHER
I might think you were scheming
against Hatsumome

you don’t have a suspicious mind

--yes-—

--your offer

(brass tacks now )
I will cover Chiyo’s schooling All
of her expenses Till after her
debut

Now I’m confident you are teasing--

I could not be more sincere If
Chiyo hasnt repaid her debt within
six months after her debut--

MOTHER
(scoffing)
Impossible Too little time

MAMEHA
(resolutely)
--then I will pay you twice over

D) Mother is astonished by the proposal -- but not more
astonished than Pumpkin and Chiyo in the hallway

MOTHER
Why no Geisha could ever--

MAMEHA
You see I am willing to assume
all the risk

MOTHER
Mameha-san you might as well toss
your money away

MAMEHA
I am certain you will not object to
one trivial condition

MOTHER
Yes

MAMEHA
If Chiyo erases her debt in the
time allowedyou will have no
part in her future earnings

to make such a foolish wager

Miyagiyama may use hataki komi---

Hataki komi is a movement a smaller
combatant uses to throw the larger
man off balance Victory does not
always belong to the powerful--

salt prepare again building tension He points brusquely

TonightWe went to the Tanizato
to see Dr Crab I sat outside
but I could still hear through the
screen Hatsumomo-neisan said to
him “I live in the same okiya as
Sayuri” His eyes got big and he
said “Really Tell me everything
about her” And she said “Oh
sir I mustn’t It would only curl
your toes” That made him even
more curious “Well” said
Hatsumomo-neisan as smooth as
silk “Did you know that she brings
men back to her room” “No” he
cried “Common sailors and
fishermen too” said Hatsumomo-
neisan And the Doctor looked
queasy like he didnt want to hear
anymore But she kept going “At
all hours of the night like an
alleycat” And then the doctor
got very quiet and stared for the
longest time at his hands And
Hatsumomo-neisan said “What’s the
matter Have I told you more than
you wanted to know”

Sayuri understands everything now

could I Chiyo-chan how

venerated My grandfather and my
father collected kimono before me

A shoji door slides shut and Mr Bekku disappears Sayuri
looks back alarmed Yet another shoji closes stranding her
alone with the Baron in the heart of the house

I’ve given a number of valuable
kimono to MamehaI like to give
presents to beautiful girls

Surrounding them burnished gold MIRRORS The Baron presents
her with a folded kimono

The Baron is too kind I will
happily try it on With Mameha-
neisan when the Baron returns to

THE BARON
Who knows when that will be Put
it on Now Don’t be shy

He pulls her against him and reaching behind her jerks open
the knot of her obi-jime (obi cord) Sayuri pushes away but
the silken obi cord spills to the mat

THE BARON (cont ‘d)
Don’t worry I am experienced in
knotting obis Untying them as
well

Please

The Baron takes her hand forcing it against the bristles of
his cheek Then he turns her palm upward grazing it with
his lips Sayuri tries to wrest her hand away

SAYURI (contd)
Mr Bekku is waiting--

THE BARON
Bekku‘s waiting for no one

He begins to unwind her obi Sayuri sees the Chairmans
handkerchief fall to the floor

She kneels and grabs it quickly In that moment the Baron
unfastens the datejime -- the waistband underneath the obi
Her kimono releases in front Sayuri gives a cry and
clutches at the fabric desperate to conceal herself

The Baron grabs her from behind pinning her arms back He
looks at her in the mirror ahead her kimono open her eyes
closed and her head turned away so that the curve of her
neck is exposed He nuzzles her

SAYURI
Stop please Stop now

Undaunted the Baron drops her outer kimono and it puddles
around her She stands--almost naked--in her underkimono

He releases that too Her under-kimono falls open
Shamelessly he reaches under it She tries to resist but
hands scuttle across her flesh like spiders

The Baron unties her final garment With a whisper of silk
he loosens the koshimaki (final layer) from around her hips
Sayuri sobs and kneels low in an effort to hide her breasts
The Baron kneels beside her and coos tenderly

THE BARON
Sayuri I only want to have a look
Nothing wrong in that Any man
would do the same

As slowly as a parent might peel the cover from a sleeping
child he opes Sayuri’s underrobe Her beautiful backthe
heart-shaped curve of her naked hipsher tabi-feet peeking
out from beneath

Slowly he forces her to sit up whispering coaxing begging
her to stand naked before the glass Sayuri turns her face
away squeezing her eyes shut Clenched in her fist the
Chairmans handkerchief

As the Baron admires her body he slips his own hand into the
dank crevices of his own kimono to pleasure himself

Sayuri weeps silently the very portrait of both beauty and
humiliation Suddenly she turns to him Her eyes are
swimming with tears They pierce his soul

Aftermath and a red sky ‘In the quiet dawn Hatsumomo walks
away bereft of everything even her household possessions

She turns back to stare at the okiya a final time her face

smeared with ash

The second floor is blackened by fire but the house still
stands Through the skeletal frame of a shoji screen window
Sayuri watches as Hatsumomo turns vanishing into the mist

From above the MENACING ROAR of AIRPLANES A FORMATION OF
ALLIED BOMBERS flies low over the torii gate their
silhouettes terrifying against the reddish sky

Suddenly the LURCHING ROAR of MILITARY TRUCKS-—

From his pocket Nobu takes a tiny shard of concrete rubble
NOBU (contd)
This is all that remains of our

She touches him tenderly

SAYURI

NOBU

NOBU
Somewhere under those ragsare
you still the greatest geisha in
Miyako

Sayuri hides her stained hands

SAYURI
(with a rueful laugh)
If a tree has no leaves or
branches can you still call it a
tree

NOBU
With nothing but rubble at my feet
can I still call myself a business
man

He takes her work-worn hand in his noticing its roughened
and patchy stains

NOBU (contd)
I should have taken better care of
you

Please You saved my life I owe
you so much in return

NOBU (cont’d)
I am not a persuasive man Sayuri
Butif you and a few geisha would
once again put on your kimono and
join us--we could show the
Anericans how hospitable our
country can be--

SAYURI
(with longing)
How I wish Nobu-san But -that was
a long time ago ‘

NOBU

I have no doubt Sayuri that you
could still melt the heart of any
man ho matter how resistant

This slightly bald confession gives Sayuri pause she doesn’t
want to encourage Nobu

NOBU (contd)
I am not accustomed to begging
But please know that--if you
consent--the Chairman and I would
be most grateful

Just his name exerts its inexorable pull SAYURI’s torn

INT MAMEHAS APARTMENT DAY AUTUMN

Mameha’s place is run-down divided by makeshift curtains
into small rooms Mameha is elegant even in a cotton kimono
with a frayed white collar but she has a shattered quality
now a fragility Sayuri has not seen before

MAMEHA (CONTD)
Only “geesha girls” Every hooker
with a painted face and a silk
kimono says she’s one of us No one
can tell the difference anymore

SAYURI
All the more reason for us to
oblige him--

MAMEHA
Why

SAYURI

To show them the truth of who we
are--not the common women they
believe us to be--

MAMEHA
Sayuriwhen my poor Baron filled
his pockets with stoneI was
desperate What could I do I
sold my kimono I traded my jade
combs for rations It was painful
at first but I have made my peace

A FEMALE BOARDER carries HER BABY through the room en route
to the street When she’s out of ear-shot Mameha continues

MAMEHA (contd)
Now I make a small but tidy living
renting rooms I am not about to
start chasing the past--

SAYURI
It might do you good
MAMEHA

SAYURI

To remind you that--once with a
single glance--you could bring a
man like the Baron to his knees

Mameha’s conviction falters She’s tempted now

MAMEHA
WellI did keep one kimono

Sayuri looks up hopeful Mameha rummages among her things
and takes out an ornate kimono box

MAMEHA (contd)
The Baron gave it to me when he
became my danna

Ah but here you make everything a
ritual don’t you

SAYURI
That is the art of turning habit
into pleasure Colonel

DERRICKS
Said like a true geisha

Nobu nods but his face betrays a slight wince

starts to speak the timbre in the room changes from raucous
to almost reverential

SAYURT
Once when I was a little girlon
the banks of the Sonogawaa
handsome stranger gave me a cup of
ice--ice that tasted as sweet as a
mid-summer plum--

The Chairman and Mameha exchange a look In Mameha’s eyes
an implicit challenge to the Chairman will you or will you
not acknowledge the truth of Sayuri‘s story The Chairmans
about to blush then he interrupts

CHATRMAN
I think we have to stop the game

PUMPKIN giggles very drunk

CHAIRMAN (cont‘d)
If Pumpkin drinks any more sake
she will pass out

PUMPKIN
Now that - is a true story

Everyone laughs Sayuri looks at the Chairman crestfallen

CHAIRMAN

not a geishas custom--

DERRICKS
If it’s a question of price--
