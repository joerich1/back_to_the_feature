MA RAINEYS BLACK BOTTOM 1

IN BLACK WE HEAR

A RAW GUTTERAL BLUES MOANGROANGROWL

THE BLACK COMES IN TO FOCUS TO REVEAL-

The blue-black full moon-of-a-face of MA RAINEY The source
of this ethereal sound She opens her mouth to wail and her
imperfect gold teeth sparkle

EXT SHOW TENT - GOD’S POV

We look down on a huge “show tent” People from every
direction drawn to the magic of Ma Rainey’s sound like flies
to stank make their way to the event

- People piled inside busted up jalopies
- Riding on “buckboard wagons”

- Dressed in their Sunday best and even if they don’t have a
Sunday best it’s been starched and pressed within an inch of
its life

AT THE ENTRANCE

The sign reads “The Mother Of The Blues Madame Gertrude “Ma”
Rainey and her Georgia Smart Set”

We see black hands passing money to other black hands Day
laborers digging deep into their pockets pulling out their
hard-earned cash

INT SHOW TENT

The place is packed with levee camp workers cotton pickers
preachers gamblers and share croppers Hard working Negro’s
feeling no pain Sanctified by her blues shouting “Well”
“Tell the truth” “Go on Ma”

And center stage illuminated by the rickety footlights is
MADAME RAINEY wringing the mess out of them blues Her
necklace of 5 10 and 20 gold pieces shining bright She
and her Jug Band working their number

MA RAINEY
(sings)
My bell rang this morning didn’t
know which way to go My bell rang
this morning didn’t know which way
to go I had the blues so bad I
sat right down on my floor
MA RAINEYS BLACK BOTTOM 2

Sweat pours down the ebony faces of the people Whether
laughter or tears it doesn’t matter It’s Saturday night and
these folks are colored and there ain’t no better place or
thing to be

MA RAINEY (CONTD)
I felt like going on a mountain
jumping over in the sea I felt
like going in a mountain jumping
over in the sea When my daddy
stay out late he don’t care a thing
for me
Daddy Daddy please come home to
me Daddy daddy please come
home to me I’m on my way crazy
as I can be

The bellow of Ma Rainey’s powerful voice blends into a train
whistle

MA RAINEY (CONTD)
Mmmmnn mmmn Mmmmnn mmmn

MONTAGE
A SERIES OF ARCHIVAL IMAGES FROM THE GREAT MIGRATION
-Black folk on train cars packed to the gills

-Beat up pick-up trucks buckboard wagons stacked with
families a chicken or two and a bunch of hopes and dreams

-All traveling past Negroes working in the fields Their
heads pop up watching their friends and kin leaving the rich
soil of the south for something better up north far away from
Jim Crow

-The field workers watch the trucks and wagons disappear up
the road fueled by Ma Rainey’s song

- We see a couple of men hopping aboard a moving freight
train Doesn’t matter where it’s going so long as it’s
headed north

SMASH CUT TO

INT CHICAGO’S GRAND THEATER

The blinding footlights of Chicago’s Grand Theater as MA
RAINEY slays the crowd The place packed with Northern
Colored people (formerly Southern Colored people)
MA RAINEYS BLACK BOTTOM 3

MA RAINEY
Daddy daddy please come home to
me Daddy daddy please come
home to me I’m on my way crazy
as I can be

MA RAINEY with her band and show girls are tearing up the
stage as LEVEE young and brash Ma’s trumpet player boldly
snatches a solo

MA RAINEY cuts her eye at LEVEE and snatches back her blues
MA RAINEY (CONTD)
Hey Hey Daddy Please come home
to me Hey Oh yeah I’m on my
way crazy as I can be

Her chorus girls begin to dance an exuberant “Charleston” MA
RAINEY joins them stretching out

IN THE WINGS

DUSSIE MAE early 20S A bronze beauty Ma’s gal dances the
show girls routine She and LEVEE trade looks

The blue lights hit Ma Rainey’s black sequined dress she
shimmies and shakes and the crowd roars as the number ends

EXT INDUSTRIAL NEIGHBORHOOD

We hear the metal wheels of the “L” rattle along the tracks
THREE COLORED MUSICIANS descend the “L” platform stairs
toting their instruments They find themselves in an all
White working class neighborhood An ICE TRUCK passes as they
hurry across the street trying to ignore the stares and
awkward glances aimed their way Clearly hauling those
instruments in the bruising summer heat has been kicking
their asses They are-

EXT BRONZEVILLE BUSINESS STREET

A MAN stands on the corner of 44th and S State St holding a
trumpet Clearly a stranger in a new land He is “country
boy sharp” His flamboyance is sometimes subtle and sneaks up
on you His temper is rakish and bright He lacks fuel for
himself and is somewhat of a buffoon But it is an
intelligent buffoonery clearly calculated to shift control
of the situation to where he can grasp it He is enthralled
by the citified Negroes stylishly dressed until he turns and
sees a SHOE STORE

SLOW DRAG (VO)
He left the hotel this morning
talking about he was gonna go buy
some shoes Say it’s the first time
he ever beat you shooting craps

A DOOR BUZZER SOUNDS and--

I was eight years old when I
watched a gang of white mens come
into my daddy’s house and have to
do with my mama any way they
wanted

LEVEE (CONTD)
We was living in Jefferson County
about eighty miles outside of
Natchez My daddys name was
MemphisMemphis Lee Greenhad
him near fifty acres of good
farming land Im talking about
good land Grow anything you want
He done gone off of shares and
bought this land from Mr Hallies
widow woman after he done passed
on Folks called him and uppity
nigger cause he done saved and
borrowed to where he could buy this
land and be independent

LEVEE (CONTD)

It was coming on planting time and
my daddy went into Natchez to get
him some seed and fertilizer
Called me say Levee you the man
of the house now Take care of your
mama while Im gone I wasnt but
a little boy eight years old

LEVEE (CONTD)
My mama was frying up some chicken
when them mens come in that house
Must have been eight or nine of
them She standing there frying
that chicken and them mens come and
took hold of her just like you take

Pauses

LEVEE (CONTD)
She tried to fight them off but I
could see where it wasnt gonna do
her any good I didnt know what
they were doing to herbut I
figured whatever it was they may as
well do to me too My daddy had a
knife that he kept around there for
hunting and working and whatnot I
knew where he kept it and I went
and got it Im gonna show you how
spooked up I was by the white man
I tried my damndest to cut one of
thems throat I hit him on the
shoulder with it He reached back
and grabbed hold of that knife and
whacked me across the chest with
it

LEVEE (CONTD)
Thats what made them stop They
was scared I was gonna bleed to
death My mama wrapped a sheet
around me and carried me two miles
down to the Furlow place and they
drove me up to Doc Albans He was
waiting on a calf to be born and
say he aint had time to see me
They carried me up to Miss Etta
the midwife and she fixed me up
My daddy came back and acted like
he done accepted the facts of what
happened But he got the names of
them mens from mama He found out
who they was and then we announced
we was moving out of that county
Said good-bye to everybodyall
the neighbors My daddy went and
smiled in the face of one of them
crackers who had been with my mama
Smiled in his face and sold him our
land We moved over with relations
in Caldwell He got us settled in
and then he took off one day I
aint never seen him since He
sneaked back hiding up in the
woods laying to get them eight or
nine men

MA RAINEYS BLACK BOTTOM 44

LEVEE (CONTD)
He got four of them before they got
him They tracked him down in the
woods Caught up with him and hung
him and set him afire

Pauses

LEVEE (CONTD)
My daddy wasnt spooked up by the
white man No sir And that taught
me how to handle them I seen my
daddy go up and grin in this
crackers facesmile in his face
and sell him his land All the
while hes planning how hes gonna
get him and what hes gonna do to
him That taught me how to handle
them So you all just back up and
leave Levee alone about the white
man I can smile and say yessir
to whoever I please I got my time
coming to me You all just leave
Levee alone about the white man

MA RAINEY

things balanced Music will do
that It fills things up The more
music you got in the world the
fuller it is

CUTLER
I can agree with that I got to
have my music too

MA RAINEY
White folks dont understand about
the blues They hear it come out
but they dont know how it got
there They dont understand thats
lifes way of talking You dont
sing to feel better You sing
‘cause thats a way of
understanding life The blues help
you get out of bed in the morning
You get up knowing you aint alone
Theres something else in the
world Somethings been added by
that song This be an empty world
without the blues I take that
emptiness and try to fill it up
with something I aint started the
blues way of singing The blues
always been here But if they wanna
call me the Mother of the Blues
thats all right with me It dont
hurt none

a grip of himself as even he senses or perhaps only he
senses he is about to lose control He looks around
uncertain of what to do TOLEDO has gone back to packing as
have CUTLER and SLOW DRAG

They purposefully avoid looking at LEVEE in hopes he’1ll calm
down if he doesn’t have an audience All the weight in the
world suddenly falls on LEVEE and he rushes at TOLEDO with
his knife in his hand

LEVEE
Nigger you stepped on my shoe

He plunges the knife into TOLEDO’s back up to the hilt
TOLEDO lets out a sound of surprise and agony CUTLER and
SLOW DRAG freeze TOLEDO falls backward with LEVEE his hand
still on the knife holding him up LEVEE is suddenly faced
with the realization of what he has done He shoves TOLEDO
forward and takes a step back TOLEDO slumps to the floor
