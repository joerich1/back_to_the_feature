Margaret throws her clothes in a suitcase
She shoves Janes clothes and toys into another

Margaret barrels through the breakfast nook which is a mini

art studio -- easel canvases paints She scoops up her
supplies
Margaret runs to the door -- then turns The hallway is lined

with her PAINTINGS Oils and inks of wide-eyed Jane who
grows from baby to toddler to child Hastily Margaret takes
them down each frame leaving an empty mark on the flowered

wallpaper Finally she reaches the last spot -- a WEDDING

A pink chubby TOURIST FAMILY ambles over Margaret brightens
hopefully

TOURIST GUY

MARGARET
Todays a special Two dollars

TOURIST GUY

Beat -- then she nods agreeing She gestures

The little BOY sits Margaret clips a fresh sheet of paper
sharpens her charcoal and goes motionless Studying the
boys face He gazes back

Then -- inspired she begins sketching his EYES Large and

exaggerated Then she fills in the shape of his head His
ears His jaw

In a rush his likeness appears The parents come over to
peek -- then gasp Margaret is good She sketches faster
Focused Until a LOUD PLUMMY VOICE drifts in

MANS VOICE
Monet Monet Whew -- thats a
hell of a compliment Though if I
may respectfully disagree Im more in
the tradition of Pissarro
Margaret looks up distracted She resumes her work

MANS VOICE
Cmon get closer Closer Look at
that sunlight coming through the
mottled leaves Thats a bold yellow
Curious Margaret casually peers over

HER POV
Holding court in another booth is WALTER KEANE 40 Walter is
astonishing Hugely confident Charming Waggishly
handsome And dressed like an Artist -- striped turtleneck
with hands full of brushes
Walters stall is filled with oils of Paris street scenes He
casually flirts with TWO YOUNG COEDS They admire a painting

WALTER
You wanna touch it Do it I lay it
on thick -- youre not gonna break it
(UNWAVERING)
I poured myself into that painting
Its thirty-five dollars

Walter glances over -- and notices Margaret watching him
Shy she quickly turns away back to her portrait
Walter smiles rakishly Hes found a new interest

WALTER
Excuse me Ladies

WIDE
Walter strides up to Margaret She peers nervously trying
to ignore him She sketches faster Shading
Walter watches Admiring and discreetly smelling her hair

Margaret pays no attention Done she blows into a can of Fix-
It Poosh A fine mist sprays setting the portrait
Without fanfare she humbly turns the picture

MARGARET
All finished
Her customers gape impressed She smiles The guy counts
out four quarters then happily leaves

MARGARET AND WALTER
are left together An unspoken frisson until --

WALTER
Youre better than spare change You
shouldnt sell yourself so cheap

MARGARET

heart is in your work
He leans in too close Margaret shivers Breathing faster

WALTER
Its a delight to meet you Signore
Buon giorno Have you been an art
lover for long
We move in tight on MARGARET as the SOUND DIALS DOWN

WALTERS VOICE
I call that piece The Waif Isnt
it striking With its juxtaposition

He takes her face in his hands

I owe you an apology I was initially
dismissive of your kids those emotion-
wrenching blobs of humanity but
they have a real strength

with little girls

Walter picks up a picture of TWO LITTLE GIRLS IN TUTUS

stares perplexed

WALTER
What would make a grown man paint a
picture like this
No answer He thinks of stories wheels spinning

WALTER
I grew up surrounded by six sisters

(NO GOOD)
I grew up in an orphanage

(STRUGGLING)
I grew up in a world where adults
had vanished and children and kittens
ran wild over the desolate landscape
Margaret smiles

MARGARET
What about your Paris street scenes
Why do you paint those

WALTER
Well because I lived it I
experienced it

MARGARET

(calling his bluff)

And was it really all sun-dappled

streets and flower vendors
Huh Walter stares off at the Waifs They peer out from

broken windows chain-link fences

ever made such an impact as the sight

of the children War-wracked

innocents without homes without

parents fighting over garbage
He sits in a half-circle of PROPER WOMEN who are spellbound

WALTER (ON TV)
Goaded by a frantic despair I
sketched these dirty ragged little
victims with their bruised minds
and bodies their matted hair and
runny noses There my life as a
painter began in earnest
Walter sadly looks up to the HOST
The man is shellshocked Mute Walter waits then sighs

upon these children cut deeply into my
being From that moment on I painted

the lost children with the eyes

Those eyes that forever retained their
haunting quality

Yeah Walter Keane and Gauguin have a

lot in common They both walked away

from successful careers to travel the

globe live on a boat
We move finding Margaret alone in a small ANNEX It
displays a few of her sad blondes alongside Jane and Lilys
paintings of flowers and Mr Potato-Head Margaret sits
seeming like an adult at the childrens table

An urbane RICH MAN glides by and is taken with one of
Margarets nubile blondes He gazes at the lounging figure
Margaret sits up Alert pleased with his interest

She tingles Then happily excited unable to hold it in

MARGARET
I painted it
RICH MAN
Really
(IMPRESSED)
Its very evocative Sensual

He smiles flirtatiously She smiles shyly and shrugs

He steps forward -- then peers closer at the painting The
SIGNATURE is a feminine scroll MDH Keane

RICH MAN
MDH Youre so mysterioso

MARGARET
Yes we dont use my name since
people dont take womens art

seriously

(BEAT)
MDH are my initials And more Im
interested in numerology and as you

know seven is a very good number
RICH MAN

(PUZZLED)
Er seven

MARGARET
Luckily my maiden name is Margaret
Doris Hawkins M is the 13th letter
of the alphabet D is 4 H 8 If
you add up 1 and 3 in 13 that gives
you 4 making 4 plus 4 plus 8 equals
16 then 1 plus 6 equals seven
The mans head is spinning Hes lost all interest
Across the room Walter sees this debacle He marches over

WALTER

Psst Maggie Can I have a second
(he PULLS HER ASIDE)

Good grief What the hell are you
babbling about Long division
Could you please help the world and
shut your mouth You want just one
number in his head The sales price
Her face drops hurt Acquiescing

WATCHING THIS
Two SNOBBY ARTISTS smirk and GROAN at this scene

SNOBBY ARTIST 1
Two nuts that fell from the same tree
Its insufferable Why are we
starving while they print money

SNOBBY ARTIST 2
Because that nuts a genius He sells
paintings Then he sells pictures of
the paintings Then he sells postcards
of pictures of the paintings

They stare bitterly Then a terrible shameful idea forms

SNOBBY ARTIST 1
Ill bet I could bang one out in ten
minutes

SNOBBY ARTIST 2
It wouldnt have the dopey sincerity

MARGARET

Jane has nice friends Sometimes I

(AWKWARD)

But shes busy Are you hungry
DEE-ANN

MARGARET

Good Ill whip us up two gin fizzes
Margaret forces a smile and scurries behind a giant curved wet
bar She pulls out ingredients Gin lemon juice soda

MARGARET
When we moved in I thought a wet bar
was extravagant but its surprising

how much use you can get out of it
Dee-Ann watches the drinkmaking

DEE-ANN
Hows Walter

MARGARET
He couldnt be happier He has
everything he ever dreamed of

DEE-ANN
And so do you Fabulous
Dee-Ann smiles archly She glances away -- and notices

DEE-ANN
Oh is that your studio
Margaret turns -- and gasps
MARGARET
No -- You cant go in --

DEE-ANN
I just want a peek See what the

artist looks like --

Margaret rushes to block her -- but Dee-Ann pushes open the

door revealing
INT PAINTING ROOM

A room full of MDHs and Keanes

Dee-Ann stops puzzled She glances at Margaret -- who has
turned white as a ghost

Immensely curious Dee-Ann slowly enters She peers around at
the two styles of paintings

A strained silence Finally Margaret whispers

MARGARET
W-Walter paints in here too
Hmm
Dee-Ann walks about examining the canvases Then her gaze
settles on the Big Eye that Margaret was working on
Below the easel is the wet brush on the open jar of paint
Margaret sucks in her breath Dee-Ann sees this

DEE-ANN
Is Walter home
Margaret has no answer
The two friends look at each other Dee-Ann waiting
wondering if Margaret is going to lie to her

When SLAM

Both women startle FOOTSTEPS Then Walter strides in

Margarets eyes pop
Walters pop even bigger He glares at the ladies

WALTER
What the hells going on here

MARGARET

(TIMID)
Uh Dee-Ann was just she
Margaret trails off Walter thinks then SNAPS

WALTER
You KNOW I dont like anyone seeing my
work before its done
Walter rushes to the Waif then for show grabs up the wet
brush and quickly starts to finish the painting
Suddenly -- an odd expression crosses his face He eyeballs
the canvas realizing he doesnt know what to do

A furtive glance Then unbowed he hastily dips the brush
and slaps a little black onto the shaded background
Walter spins victorious

WALTER
There

Okay honey I have to go work

No I can never come No I

Margaret peers hopelessly at her daughter then goes inside

INT WOODSIDE HOUSE

Margaret strolls to her studio WE SEE the poodle scampering
behind her on its cute little legs She enters the

Margaret doesnt notice the tiny dog follow her in She LOCKS
the door then turns -- surprised

MARGARET
Where did you appear from Didnt you
hear No visitors
Rembrandt wags his tail his little eyes bright Margaret
peers

MARGARET
Is this what its come to Youre the
only living soul I can tell my secret
(she lowers her voice)
Well -- I painted them all
(she shudders with release)
Its TRUE I did every single one --
She gestures then catches sight of a Walter street scene

MARGARET
Well every one except that street
scene

(BEAT)

But I did the rest Every Big Eye

And nobody will ever know But YOU

Rembrandt pants and BARKS

Margaret chuckles then goes to work She pulls a CURTAIN
across the sliding glass door At her easel she squirts a
tube into a well and starts mixing colors

Rembrandt jumps on the couch

MARGARET

No you dont Its nice to have
company but that sofa is new

(she pushes him off)

Lets find you some carpet to lay on

Margaret goes over to a CLOSET Rembrandt follows curious

IN THE CLOSET
Margaret turns on the bare bulb inside Its filled with old
easels cans junk

MARGARET
I think theres a scrap back here
She rummages sliding the junk aside In back is a TATTERED

WOODEN CRATE
Hm

MARGARET
Well whats this
Margaret swings the bulb closer The crate is covered with
SHIPPING INSTRUCTIONS and international markings
Margarets interest is piqued She tugs at the lid pulling
it off Revealing inside a STACK OF STREET SCENE PAINTINGS
Ten or fifteen of Walters canvases
Or so it seems

TIGHT - MARGARET
She peers closer

TIGHT - THE PAINTINGS

The top painting is a typical Parisian street scene Cobble
stones a man carrying baguettes an old lady selling roses
But down in the bottom corner is the signature S CENIC

TIGHT - MARGARET
She sucks in her breath shocked She examines the painting
Then she hurriedly grabs the next canvas Its another

sunlit scene A quaint Parisian cafe a man playing accordian
and in the bottom right corner the signature S CENIC
WHAT Margaret grabs the next canvas S CENIC

The next canvas

The next canvas

They all are signed S CENIC

Margaret starts hyperventilating

She thinks then suddenly bolts from the closet
INT PAINTING ROOM

Margaret races rushing up to Walters painted street scene
hung on the wall We PUSH IN TIGHT as she shoves her face up
to the canvas so close we can see the brushstrokes --

As we MOVE IN TO THE SIGNATURE Simply W KEANE

Margarets face is flushed She gazes at the name then
rushes back to her work area She manically hunts Brushes
tubes rags -- and an EXACTO KNIFE

Ah She runs back to Walters painting Heart pounding she
grazes the knife up against the signature then DIGS

And -- the W KEANE flecks off Revealing underneath
the name S CENIC

CLOSEUP - MARGARET
She trembles overcome Music SWELLS Her eyes spin back --

BACK ON MARGARET
She collapses

CUT TO
INT WOODSIDE HOUSE - THAT EVENING

A grandfather clock says 1015 Margaret sits gloomily
staring at the clock Clutching a drink

LATER
230 am Margaret still stares at the clock Shes stewing
Suddenly keys in the door Walter swings in tanked and full
of life He skids across the marble humming to himself --
when -- hes startled by his wife He jerks

WALTER
M-Maggie Whatre you doin up
Margaret glares Not speaking He shrugs

WALTER
I had a helluva night Worked three
or four clubs
(he winks loosey-goosey)
Stumbled onto some hot gossip Madame
Chiang Kai-shek is coming to town
Straight from Taipei I think we
should present her with a painting --
get Dick to flack it

(HE THINKS)
Or the heck with Dick I met a new
guy at UPI

MARGARET
Maybe you should give her one of your
street scenes

WALTER

(HAZY)
You think I dunno -- I thought you
could whip off a doodle of Chinatown
With a cute little kid sort of a big-
eyed slanty-eyed thing
Margarets anger is raging She glares steely

MARGARET
No Walter Shes a dignitary
Doesnt she deserve a piece that comes
straight from you

(SHARP)
From your experience

WALTER
Yeah Maybe youre right She
probably doesnt have a Parisian
street scene hanging in her palace

Margaret nods as if theyve settled something She turns
walk away -- then suddenly SPINS
MARGARET

Unless Madame Chiang Kai-shek already
has a Cenic

ON WALTER

He freezes up
Suddenly sober smacked to reality

to
WALTER
Cenic Uh whats that
Margaret stares eyes sharp

MARGARET
Cenic is the name of the artist who
did all your early paintings

WALTER
Huhhh
(spinning his lie)
Urgh oh CENIC

(he laughs crazily)

Cenic was my nickname in Paris All
my art school pals loved my scenic
views so they called me Scenic
But since those Frogs cant pronounce
a hard e I became Cenic
He looks up at her hopefully
But she shakes her head

MARGARET
The more you lie the smaller you seem

WALTER
(unyielding scrambling)
How DARE you accuse me of lying Im
proud of my early Cenics

MARGARET
Then why do you paint over the name
Walter gasps floored
Margaret bores in

MARGARET
A bit of advice Dont use a water-
base over an oil It flecks off
Walter cowers

WALTER
You sound crazy For Gods sake
Youve youve SEEN me paint
MARGARET

No I havent

(QUIET STRONG)
I always thought I had but its

some kind of mirage From a
distance you look like a painter but
up close theres nothing there

CLOSEUP - WALTER
All life drains from his face His eyes go glazed He speaks
mechanically Tiredly

WALTER
I studied art in Paris I went to
school at the Beaux-Arts The Grand
Chaumiere I spent hours in the
Louvre gazing at the greatness of the
Masters

MARGARET
Walter
He turns She winces pained

MARGARET
Have you even been to Paris
Walter blanches He shakes broken up
He looks away then staggers to a chair He falls into it
Trembling Not able to look her in the eye

WALTER
I wanted I so wanted to be an
artist But -- it just never turned

out good
Margaret stares seething
Then without comment she storms away She SLAMS the door
shut BANG
Walter doesnt move

CUT TO
INT KITCHEN - NEXT MORNING

Margaret makes Jane breakfast scrambling up eggs

Jane glances over her shoulder -- and notices Walter in the
living room asleep on the couch

An awkward pause Jane says nothing

INT MASTER BEDROOM - LATER

Margaret is making the bed Straightening the pillows

In the bg Walter silently creeps into view Shamefully
standing in the doorway Not speaking

Margaret knows hes there but doesnt acknowledge his
presence Finally without making eye contact --

MARGARET
I dont want you sleeping in this room
any longer I -- I cant keep living

these lies
(SHARP)
Theres three extra bedrooms Go pick
one
He nods

INT HOUSE - LATER

Margaret sits unmoving trapped in the big house Outside a
JAPANESE GARDENER trims the hedges

Margaret stares at the walls a smothering Walter Hall of
Fame Framed magazine articles on Walter smugly posed with
the Waifs

She swallows then gently opens a dresser drawer Inside is
an ORIGINAL WAIF from long ago A small oil of Jane when she
was a toddler

Margaret stares and then her face slowly crumbles

INT PAINTING ROOM - DAY

Margaret huddles with a SKETCHPAD Rembrandt is at her feet
Shes drawing She looks up as Walter anxiously enters
Hes holding a drink He clears his throat

WALTER
What are you working on

MARGARET
A new MDH Something for me Its
about a woman trapped in an uncaring
world I call it Escape
Walter bites his lip afraid to talk

WALTER
I figured out a solution to our
problems
MARGARET
What
WALTER
Teach me
(BEAT)

Show me your tricks Then you can
pass off the Waifs and we wont be
lying anymore

She looks up in disbelief

MARGARET

And then -- YOULL paint them
WALTER

Sure Why not
MARGARET

(OF FENDED )
Walter this isnt paint-by-numbers
You think its easy It took me
years to learn --

WALTER
Y-youre right

(SHEEPISH)
But you know me Im a quick study
And Ive got the basics
He trails off unsure where this is going
Trying to rouse her Walter rushes to an easel and throws up a
blank canvas She eyeballs him

MARGARET
If you knew the basics you wouldnt
be at the easel You have to sketch
it first
Walter tightens feeling stupid He lets go of the canvas
Margaret stares deciding Then she tosses him a PAD
Walter catches it Slowly he crosses over

ANGLE - MARGARET AND WALTER
They peer at each other like a Mexican standoff Then he
nervously picks up a pencil

WALTER
So Whats first

MARGARET
I dunno You tell me Youre the
creator
He frowns
WALTER
Its a -- Keane
MARGARET

Oh a Keane How witty

(SARCASTIC)
You know when we met all those years
ago I never wouldve imagined in my
wildest dreams that one day --

WALTER
YEAH YEAH Point taken Im standing
here naked and humiliated in front of
you Look can we just do a crying
child
She gazes at him Fingering her pencil
Trying to jump-start things he starts to draw a circle --

MARGARET
How old is the subject

WALTER
Huh Cmon its a head --

MARGARET
It matters A young childs head is
round An older childs head is oval
He feels pressured Hand shaking he draws a crooked circle

WALTER
The child is this old

(ANGRY)
Youre trying to make this difficult --

MARGARET
NO IM NOT Every line is a decision

(IMPASSIONED)
Its easy to talk about art but its
not easy to MAKE art

DISSOLVE TO
INT PAINTING ROOM - MONTAGE

Margaret easily outlines a head then two circles for eyes
Walter tries copying but his eyes are misshapen

Again Walter copies but hes wobbly Angry he scratches it
out

Margaret tries to help guiding his hand Insulted he pushes
her off He CRUMPLES the page

NEW TACTIC Walter grabs her sketch He puts it on a LIGHT-
TABLE Despairing he starts to trace it

LATER
Walter finally paints We cant see the canvas but hes very
meticulous His expression quite earnest He adds a final
flourish and then a flicker of pride crosses his face
He smiles

We slowly MOVE AROUND to REVEAL HIS PAINTING And
its absolutely dreadful Kindergarten quality

Walter stares

Then he furtively glances at Margarets work Comparing
The realization slowly sinks in He has no ability

A sadness swells into fury and suddenly Walter GRABS HIS
CANVAS and SMASHES IT AGAINST THE EASEL CRASH The canvas
SHREDS The frame blasts into pieces
Walter spins He glares at one of Margarets finished
Waifs then explodes even more enraged HE PICKS UP

MARGARETS PAINTING AND STARTS TO SWING IT AT THE WALL --

MARGARET (0S)
Walter
Huh He lurches startled

ACROSS THE ROOM

Margaret stares him down

Sweaty chest heaving Walter staggers towards her His face
scowls untamed He clenches his fist like he might attack

MARGARET --
Then -- he SCREAMS and smashes her CANVAS BAM The
painting RIPS apart Walter KICKS his foot through the
remains then spins and charges from the room

WALTER
Okay Different question If I got

inventory and went belly up

REDHEAD CLERK

(RATTLED)

Walter sighs His thoughts drift away

WALTER

Walter silently watches At the register the Tourists buy a

Distracted he glances down at a newspaper

in art school and somehow we waylaid
your youthful experiments The half-
finished charcoals the struggles

Quickly she stands on a chair and reaches above the door

Jane peers sadly at her mother

JANE

Suddenly she runs after Jane and grabs her tightly

WOMEN patiently walking toward the isolated house

Margaret stares puzzled The women come closer They are
Asian dressed in formal dresses Curious Margaret creeps
over spying on them

They walk up and ring the bell DING-DONG An unsure beat
then Margaret opens the door The ladies smile politely

ASIAN LADY 1
Hello Were visiting everyone in
this neighborhood with an important
message No doubt youre busy so

about the wonderful things that Gods
Kingdom will do for mankind
Margarets face darkens

MARGARET

She starts to close the door but they continue

ASIAN LADY 1
Do you mean that you are not
interested in the Bible or in
religion in general
MARGARET
Im not interested in whatever youre
selling
The lady glances at Margarets glass She smiles gently

ASIAN LADY 2
But were not selling anything Were
just here to share the good news

MARGARET

From where Im standing I dont see
much good anywhere Just a lot of
pride and thievery and people
treating each other poorly

And as such she has to prove that our
newspapers published statements aware
of probable falsity

(BEAT)
But there is no evidence that our
editors could have known that the
assertions were untrue

This is a very strange case These
paintings hang in museums all over the
world attributed to Mr Keane And
regardless of the truth Mrs Keane
has contributed immeasurably to the
confusion

It seems impossible that Gannetts
actions would ever meet the legal
standard for libel So -- the charge
against them is dismissed

leave and support myself and my

YESSS
Walter bounces out a bit manic He runs back to his lawyer
table then spins to address the empty witness stand

WALTER

Mr Keane There has been a lot of

innuendo and contradictory testimony

about the genesis of the big-eyed

waifs Would you mind clarifying to

this court once and for all who

spawned these paintings
Walter sprints back into the witness stand He sits then
reacts coyly as if hes surprised

WALTER
Why -- I created the children
Walter starts to stand again -- but the Judge SLAMS his bench

JUDGE
The choreography is not necessary

Just sit down and testify

Oh Walter sits then gathers his thoughts
We slowly PUSH IN He smiles wistfully

WALTER
Ive had a wonderful life Ive been
an artist a world traveler a friend
of untold celebrities
(he gets misty-eyed)
But when I look back at it all when I
peer into my heart and define what
mattered

(MORE)

WALTER (CONTD)
it is that I was dedicated to the
hungry children of the world

(GENUINE)
It all began in Berlin After World
War II

DISSOLVE TO
LATER

WALTER
the orphans were clutching the
barbed wire Their bodies lacerated
their fingers scrawny their eyes big
and helpless Imploring me begging

Miss Natalie Wood walked up and said

The Judge is bored out of his mind

WALTER
I was born in a small town My father
made upholstery for the automobile

INDUSTRY --

JUDGE
Youre done
Walter stops surprised

WALTER
B-but Im not finished --

JUDGE
Actually you are
(he blows his stack)
I cannot stomach one more wild tangent
or shaggy dog tale Youre not
testifying -- youre filibustering
The Federal Courts are overburdened
enough without your docket-clogging
nonsense

(BEAT)
We can stay here until we grow old and
die but its obvious that this case

boils down to your word versus Mrs
Keanes word

WALTER

(HOPEFUL)
So mistrial

JUDGE
NO Its not a mistrial In my
opinion theres only one way to clear
up this thicket You are both going
to paint
Walter gasps stunned All color drains from his face

ANGLE - MARGARET
Her face lights up She slowly breaks into a satisfied smile

CUT TO
INT COURTROOM - LATER

The doors SLAM open The Bailiff leads in a crew of COURT
DEPUTIES all carrying ART SUPPLIES Easels brushes paint

BAILIFF

Awright bring those easels down

Careful dont bump anything watch

it with those paint cans I got some

newspaper on the floor down front

The Jury is fascinated
Margaret watches quite eager In the gallery Jane grins
But Walter is horrified Trying not to tremble

DOWN FRONT
The Bailiff directs the deputies setting up TWO EASELS back
to back On each easel is placed a small square canvas
The Judge addresses the room

JUDGE
Now Im not looking for a
masterpiece I dont know much about
these things -- Im a jurist not an
art critic -- but is one hour enough
Margaret nods Sure
Shaking Walter barely moves his head

JUDGE
Okay then Youve both been provided
with identical supplies so --
without any further business Mrs

Keane Mr Keane the court is yours

WIDE
Margaret glances at Walter What will he do
Walters face is grimly blank
Margaret proceeds Slowly she pushes her chair from the
table and rises
Walter doesnt move
Margaret walks over to the closest EASEL then sits She ties
on a smock over her checkered dress

THE JURORS
crane their necks intently curious
MARGARET
takes a pencil She peeks over at Walter -- whos still glued
to his seat His face tight his expression queasy Staring
off to some faraway place
Margaret looks up at the CLOCK 320
Okay then Totally calm in a motion shes done so many
times she focuses on the canvas and starts outlining a Waif
Everybody watches Effortlessly she pencils the EYES They
are enormous The largest orbs she has ever done

WALTER
looks ill Wracked with uncertainty
The Judge turns to him

JUDGE
Mr Keane

WALTER

(FAINT)
Im setting the mood

(WHISPERING)
Getting the muse to strike

JUDGE

(BEAT)
Well your muse has 58 minutes

MARGARET
fills in more detail Ears nose then little fingers
clutching a fence The child is peeking over it staring
right at us

WALTER
is melting down In total crisis

THE CLOCKS
second hand sweeps around Its 334

THE JURORS
look from Margaret to Walter Why isnt he moving

MARGARET
finishes penciling She leans back satisfied with the
composition Then she reaches for the PAINT

She unscrews a tube and squirts it on the palette She rests
it on her lap and starts mixing a flesh tone

THE JUDGE
gapes at Walter befuddled
WALTER
feels all eyes on him He has to do something
Hesitantly visibly shaking he rises from the table
Margaret notices this

Walter braces himself trying to look confident then takes a
step Suddenly -- he SQUEALS

WALTER

ow
Walter contorts his face in AGONY
He grabs his shoulder

JUDGE
Mr Keane Are you all right

WALTER
No -- its --

(GRIMACING)
Ah shoot My old shoulder injury just
flared up Ive got a bad muscle --
Ive been taking medication for the
inflammation
Walter shrugs pathetically --

WALTER
I -- I dont think Ill be able to
paint today
THE JUDGE
is astonished
WIDE

The courtroom reacts

MARGARET
peers at Walter knowingly
Shes not surprised This was his only way out
A look between them -- and then she cocks a half-smile and
turns back to the canvas She squirts out some white oil
paint then begins painting the eyes

WALTER
sinks down in his chair beaten All life gone
He stares at the emerging canvas eyes wide and we PUSH INTO

WALTERS FACE He is witnessing the end of his empire the
destruction of everything that makes him who he is
We push in TIGHTER TIGHTER until the screen fills with

his two eyes

Big Sad And filling with tears
CUT TO
EXT FEDERAL COURTHOUSE - DAY

The doors open and Margaret comes tumbling out victorious
She has WON

Shes surrounded by Jane her friends and a MOB OF REPORTERS
They all SHOUT Mrs Keane Margaret Congratulations

MARGARET
Thank you Thank you so much

REPORTER 2

She smiles clutching the finished Waif

MARGARET
Exhibit 224
They all ROAR with laughter A Reporter does a stand-up

REPORTER 1
The jury found in favor of Margaret
Keane on all points She won on
charges of defamation emotional
distress damaged reputation --

IN THE BACKGROUND
Walter drifts out disheveled and lost He stares hazily
angrily at the crowd

WALTER
What a group of idiots a quagmire
of incompetence

(RAMBLING)
This doesnt change a thing
We slowly PULL AWAY leaving him tiny in the shot Forgotten

BACK AT MARGARET
She hugs Jane The Reporter jumps in

REPORTER 2
Margaret Do you feel vindicated by
the high award

MARGARET
Oh it was never about the money
And honestly -- I doubt Walter will

even pay

The Reporter chuckles Margaret turns serious

MARGARET
I just wanted credit for what I had
done The justice is I got my art
back

(SOFT)

My prayers have been answered

Margaret takes Janes hand and starts to walk away

Among the eager fans a PORTLY LADY steps out holding a BOOK
She smiles nervously

PORTLY LADY
Margaret Could I possibly have your
autograph
Margaret looks down -- and realizes the book is Walters
volume of TOMORROWS MASTERS
Margaret stares at it in wonder then quickly signs the cover

CLOSEUP - MARGARET
We hold She slowly smiles in pride

DISSOLVE TO
INT MARGARET KEANE GALLERY - DAY

A brand-new gallery of Margarets art The walls are covered
with NEWLY-PAINTED Waifs and MDHs We GLIDE through the
gallery down the corridors of children and women

These paintings of big-eyed children are different Theyre

in magnificent colorful gardens surrounded by joyful splashes
of red orange green

CLOSING CARDS
Walter never accepted defeat insisting he was the true
artist for the rest of his life He died in 2000 bitter and
penniless He never produced another painting
Margaret found personal happiness and remarried After many
years in Hawaii she moved back to San Francisco and opened a
new gallery She still paints everyday
We move CLOSER to one child into the face until the eyes
fill the frame And then finally we tilt down Revealing
that the child is smiling

FADE OUT

THE END
