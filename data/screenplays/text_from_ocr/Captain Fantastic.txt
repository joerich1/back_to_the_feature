GREEN EXT CASCADE MOUNTAIN RANGE WASHINGTON STATE DAWN

In the early morning dawn the Skykomish River in Washington
States Cascade Mountain Range pounds against the granite
river rocks

Giant Fir branches in the lush forest undulate almost
dancing in the soft wind

A BLACK-TAILED BUCK makes its way through the dense woods

The deer walks to the bank dips its mouth into the river
and drinks

Tall grass parts and out of the morning fog comes a young
man completely COVERED IN MUD a massive serrated hunting
knife in his hands

This is BODEVAN Hes 18 with wispy hair down to his
shoulders

The deer turns its head sensing something
Bo freezes - perfectly camouflaged in the tall grass
The deer sniffs the air but as Bo is covered in mud and

animal skins it smells nothing It relaxes drinking from
the river again

Bo exhales silently

In a flash Bo leaps out of the grass and in one continuous
motion tackles the deer and slices the animal’s carotid
artery The deer does nothing more than flinch blood spurts
from it’s neck and it just folds hemorrhagic shock taking
over

Its a perfect kill

Bo watches and the animal takes its final breath

Then he signals and five KIDS glide into the clearing They
range in age from 14 to 6 all have long unruly hair dirty
faces and wear over the usual kids clothes of t-shirts and
jeans what looks like animal skins They are two twin 15-
year old girls KIELYR and VESPYR RELLIAN a boy of 13
ZAJA a 8-year old girl and lastly NAI a 6-year old boy

The other kids surround Bo staring down at the fallen deer

Like some primordial warrior his upper body camouflaged by
mud BEN CASH rises out of the grass Hes 45 and has a
formidable beard but his body is lithe and muscular fit
like a man half his age

Ben plunges his finger in the deers throat He paints a
stripe of blood across Bos face

BEN
Today The boy is dead And in his
place Is a man
Everyone pauses for the deep solemnity of the moment

Bo slits open the animal its innards spill onto the earth

Ben raises his hands high in the air and - as if hes saying
a prayer - closes his eyes

The IMAGE FREEZES - as the title comes up around him

CAPTAIN FANTASTIC

EXT FOREST MORNING 2

Trailed by the rest of the family Ben and Bo carry the deer -
legs tied to a tree limb - through the thick forest

EXT TIPI MORNING 3

While Ben and Bo attach the deers feet to rope swing the
rope over a tree and string it high off the ground we get
our first glimpse of their home

In a clearing hidden under a canopy of enormous Douglas Fir
trees next to a small greenhouse garden - a large Tipi sits
behind a fire pit

A few of the kids jump on small wooden platforms grab
hanging rope and pull themselves up on these little
elevators Cascading high into the trees above the Tipi is
a kids paradise of funky tree houses zip lines rope
bridges hammocks and observation platforms

Rellian strums on a guitar He sings Little Red Corvette by
Prince

( )
GREEN BEN
Training in one hour

Ben watches as in front of their Tipi strung from a rope
on a tree the twins skin the deer that Bo shot peeling off
its hide with none of the squeamishness of 15-year olds and
all the skill of experienced butchers

Behind them 12-year old Rellian with a flint that he
extracts from a pouch on his belt makes a fire in a large
pit in front of the Tipi

VESPYR
Dad Wheres the boning knife Zaja

Ben nods

EXT TREE HOUSE DAY

Ben climbs up a wood ladder ducking intricately woven
branches to enter what looks like a massive birds nest

Zaja sits on the floor cleaning the skeleton of a small
animal with a 6-inch boning knife

Inside the tree house has been turned into some kind of
grotesque Death Shrine Its plastered with actual animal
skeletons magazine photographs of dead bodies from the
Holocaust and pictures of Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge From
the look on Bens face this is the first time hes seen
Zajas interior design

BEN
Jesus

Zaja looks at the photo on the wall She shakes her head no

ZAJA
Pol Pot

Ben puts out his hand and Zaja passes him the boning knife

EXT MOUNTAIN MEADOW MORNING

In a mountain meadow Ben and the kids their eyes closed
sit cross-legged in a circle

Silence

Apart from the rustle of the leaves as the wind blows through
the trees the occasional chirping of distant birds

( )
GREEN 5

Ben opens his eyes and says Okay

All the children jump up wooden sticks in their hands and
Ben teaches them what looks like commando knife-fighting

This is not a suburban mall karate class

Bo slashes at Ben with his stick In one swift movement Ben
deflects with his forearm and hip-throws Bo Bo hits the
ground hard Bens stick already pressing into Bos throat A
kill strike shocking in its sudden violence

The others watch taking all of this utterly seriously then
break into pairs and practice the move

Rellian glares at his father but makes no move to join

Ben watches Kielyr and Vespyr Theyre attacking and
defending like its a choreographed dance

BEN
If you dont stab to kill Really
stab For the liver Or the kidneys
Shell never learn

ZAJA
Shouldnt we aim here A knife in
the lungs creates pneumothorax Or
next to the sternum to penetrate
the heart That would be instant
death

Ben looks over at his 8-year old standing next to Nai

BEN
If it makes you happy Zaj Sure
Aim for the heart

Vespyr eyes her sister but is still hesitating

BEN (CONTD)
The stick will break before it hurts
her

Vespyr attacks again but this time she overcompensates
Kielyrs parry is ineffectual and Vespyrs stick hits her
sister in the stomach The stick breaks and Kielyr YELPS in
pain

BEN (CONT’D)
Good

( )

GREEN KIELYR
What How is that good She stabbed
me She fucking stabbed me

BEN
Then you better learn to defend
yourself

Ben hands Vespyr another stick

EXT TIPI NIGHT

Flames illuminate the faces of the family as they eat roast
venison sitting on the ground in a circle around the fire

By the light of candles and kerosene lamps the kids are
reading books way beyond their years Nai is reading the
Encyclopedia Brittanica hes on letter J Kielyr is
reading Guns Germs and Steel The Fates of Human
Societies by Jared Diamond Rellian reads Dostoyevskys
Brothers Karamazov Bo is reading a college Calculus

BEN

Good then tomorrow you can give a
little presentation on M-Theory

Rell vis-a-vis Witten and Dirac

Vespyr makes a face at Kielyr Neither sees that Ben catches
the look

Ben puts down his notebook He watches the children reading
for a moment

Then he picks up his guitar Improvises a rhythmic strum
Punctuates it with little abrupt vocalizations So funky one
cant help but be drawn in

The kids ignore him but gradually one at a time each of
them pick up a different musical instrument - a flute drums

a trombone a violin - and joins him

Soon everyone is up on their feet Dancing and singing and
playing their instruments - illuminated by the light of the
fire - grooving to their improvised song and having a blast

together dressed for bed staring expectantly at their

As the reality of Bens words hit them utter devastation
passes over the childrens face And then in a matter of
seconds they all burst into tears snot comes out of their
noses tears roll down their faces some of them are almost
hyperventilating Grieving openly and deeply its like
something out of Greek Tragedy Elemental Primal

carabiners around their belts and are tied onto the bright
orange climbing rope following Ben as he makes his way up
the face Its an expert grade and theyre all struggling

Without warning Rellian slips - plummeting at least ten feet

- falling hard The rope catches and he swings spiraling
into the granite face He smashes his hand against the rock
but finally manages to steady himself grabbing hold of the
face with his other hand

RELLIAN

Rellian is shaking trying to catch his breath He looks
down Hundreds of feet below are a cluster of massive rocks

The other kids wait looking up at Ben for guidance Ben
doesnt move

BEN
There is no cavalry No one will
magically appear to save you in the
end

Rellian grits his teeth He stretches out his leg again But
hes losing balance Right before he slips he pushes off
with his other foot and swings just managing to land on the
far edge that seemed too far As soon as he lands he swings
and leaps again finding a hand hold with his good hand He
looks up at his dad and nods

Ben smiles

absolutely despondent Listless and lost Staring out the
window Or at nothing

Ben slams on the breaks He stares at a sign an arrow points
to the right and an arrow points to the left He grabs the PA
radio and flips the switch

BEN

We cant go to Mommys funeral We
have to do what were told Some
fights you cant win The powerful
control the lives of the powerless
This is how the world works Its
unjust and unfair But too bad We
just have to shut up and accept it

KIELYR

Theres this old man Who loves this
girl But shes only -

( )

GREEN BEN
Thats the plot

Kielyr pauses considering how to articulate her feelings
about the book

Ben smiles

KIELYR
Because its written from his
perspective you sort of understand
and sympathize with him Which is
amazing Because essentially he’s a
child molester But his love for her
is beautiful But its also kind of a
trick because its so wrong Hes
old and he basically rapes her So it
makes me feel I hate him and I
feel sorry for him At the same time

NAI
Why would a man stick his penis in a
womans vagina
BEN
Because it gives them both pleasure
And the combination of a mans sperm
and a womans egg creates a baby and
continues the human race

But thats where she pees
BEN
Pee comes not from the vagina but
from the urethra which is within
the outer labia But yes generally
speaking That is where she pees
This seems to further confuse Nai

In the late 1800s whites arrived in
this area by the thousands depleting
the food and water supplies of the
indigenous people Horrific acts of
violence were committed on both
sides But as the US government
wasnt doing anything about the
frisky natives people thought theyd
better settle this themselves So in

A sea of mourners in BLACK sit a large Catholic church for
the funeral Mass

The PRIEST stands in front of the congregation an enormous
statue of Christ on the Cross above the altar at his back As
he speaks in a warm and caring voice incense smoke rises
behind him

PRIEST
O God to whom mercy and forgiveness
belong hear our prayers on behalf of
your servant Leslie Cash whom you
have called out of the world and
because she put her hope and trust in
you command that she be carried
safely home to Heaven and come to
enjoy your eternal reward Amen

The entire crowd repeats Amen

Just then Ben and his brightly-colored family walk to the
front of the church

They pass Harper Dave Justin and Jackson who find it hard
to mask their utter shock at the sight of what Ben and his
kids are wearing

Ben and the kids sit in the first row

GREEN 71

Jack and Abigail also in the first row now turn to see Ben
and his family Jacks face turns bright red but there is
nothing he can do now

Ben nods at Jack Jack looks away at the priest
The priest eyes the newcomers for a second then continues

PRIEST (CONTD)
I did not know Leslie personally And
I am poorer for it But I understand
that she was a loving mother who gave
up her law practice to raise her
children Leslie loved her mother
Angela her father Jack and their
dogs Harvey and Little Bear They
have told me that she also loved
gardening And classical music
Particularly Glenn Goulds version of
the Goldberg Variations And walks in
the moonlight on the beach And she
loved her husband Ben and their
children -

BEN
Ill take that as my cue if I may

Before Jack can stop him Ben jogs to the front of the
church He stands directly in front of the priest

BEN (CONTD)
First off Leslie practiced
Buddhism Which to her was a
philosophy and not an organized
religion In fact Leslie abhorred
organized religion thought it the
single most dangerous fairy-tale
ever invented used to strike fear
and obedience into the hearts of the
innocent and uninformed She saw it
not just as a source of injustice
but as a crime against humanity To
her - the only thing worse than death
would have been the knowledge that
her rotting flesh was to be trapped
for all eternity in a box in the
middle of a fucking golf course

At this there are audible GASPS from the congregation

Jack pushes his way out of the pew and whispers to some
USHERS IN BLACK SUITS

( )

GREEN BEN (CONT’D)
Though the absurdity of being
eulogized by someone who didnt even
know her has exactly the kind of
comedic flourish that she would have
cherished

Ben looks at his kids They nod at him encouraging him to

continue

BEN (CONTD)
If nothing else Leslie had a sense
of humor

Ushers in black suits guided by Jack now inch toward the

podium

Ben ignores them He takes a piece of paper from his jacket

USHER
Sir Please

BEN
I want to read you all something So
you know what I mean I found this
after her death Its Leslies Will
And I quote In the event of her
death Leslie Abigail Cash as a
Buddhist wishes to be cremated Her
funeral such as it is shall be a
celebration of the life-cycle with
music and dancing After it is her
expressed desire that her ashes shall
be taken to a nondescript location
preferably public and heavily
populated so as to be utterly
unremarkable At which point her
ashes promptly and unceremoniously
are to be flushed down the nearest
toilet End quote

Ben looks up at the mourners

BEN (CONT’D)
Now THATs comedy

The ushers rush Ben He resists but there are too many men
for Ben to fight and he is overpowered

listening She did not want this

She plants a foot on a water spout grabs a tree branch and -

in one swift motion - swings herself up to the lip and flips

She kneels in the dark scanning Planning

Like a trapeze artist nimble and moving swiftly Vespyr
shimmies across a long narrow section of the roof

She leaps landing in a crouch on a flat section of the roof
and pauses again analyzing her trajectory

She pounces gripping a drain pipe and flings herself upward
Its steep its slow going but shes strong

Now at the very top of the house fifty feet off the ground
she shuffles over a cupola and drops onto another section of
the roof

She hovers over a second story window the light on now only
5 feet away

She turns and gripping a tile she lowers herself
CRACK

The tile snaps and - in an instant - Vespyr tumbles down the
roof

She bumps and somersaults head over heels her hands
grasping at the roof as she falls but theres nothing to
hold

And she flips over the edge

Dropping twenty feet

Until her body slams - with a sickening thud - against an SUV
parked in the gravel driveway She rolls off a rag doll and
flops to the driveway
