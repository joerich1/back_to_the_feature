Mother Miriam removes a tray from under a pot plant and

MOTHER MIRIAM
(sitting again)
She cant even remember the birth Do
you think shed admit to the conception

MARTHA
Look someone gave her the baby

MOTHER MIRIAM

somebody has anything to do with this
trial

MARTHA

Why do you think that

MOTHER MIRIAM
Dont ask me those questions dear

MARTHA
Well Im the doctor Im the one whos
going to decide what is or is not

mothers get ve

ers go away
ry ill

ies cry a lot

and they
and their

die sometimes

Agnes sits down on a bench and Martha follows her
AGNES (Cont)

Mummy wasnt very happy when she died
and I think she went to hell because
every time I see her she looks like she
just stepped out of a hot shower andl
Im never sure if its her or the Lady who
tells me things They fight over me all
the time

(staring into space)
The Lady I saw when I was ten I was
lying on the grass looking at the sun and
the sun became a cloud and the cloud
became a Lady And she told me she would
talk to me And then her feet began to
bleed and I saw there there were holes
in her hands and in her side And I tried to
catch the blood as it fell from the sky but
I couldnt see any more because my eyes
hurt because there were big black spots in
front of them And she tells me things like
like right now shes crying Marie Marie
- but I dont know what that means

Martha stands up disturbed Agnes is slightly delirious with
happiness

AGNES (Cont)
and she uses me to sing its as
if shes throwing a big hook through
the air and it catches me under my ribs
and tries to pull me up and I I cant
move because Mommys holding my feet
and all I can do is sing in her voice
its the Ladys voice God loves you

And her cry echoes all around and the doves fly out of the
bell

tower
AGNES (Cont)
(to Martha)

God loves you

MARTHA
Do you know a Marie

AGNES
No do you

MARTHA
Why should I

AGNES

I dont know
23 INT - MOTHER MIRIAMS STUDY - DAY

Mother Miriam is standing checking some papers when Martha
enters Mother Miriam seems to have entirely regained her good
humour

MOTHER MIRIAM
Well what do you think Is she
totally bananas or merely slightly
off centre or maybe shes perfectly
sane and just a very good liar

MARTHA
Whats your opinion

MOTHER MIRIAM
I believe Agnes is different

MARTHA
From other nuns
(laughs)
Yes I Ive noticed

MOTHER MIRIAM
From other people
(moving across the room)
I believe she is not crazy nor is she
lying

MARTHA
How could she have a baby and know
nothing of sex or birth

MOTHER MIRIAM
Because shes an innocent Shes a slate
thats hasnt been touched except by God

MARTHA
(lights a cigarette)

Thats ridiculous

MOTHER MIRIAM

(moves to her desk

starts writing)
In her case it isnt Shes had very little
schooling Her mother kept her home
almost all the time and when her mother
died Agnes came here to us Shes never
been out there Doctor Shes never seen a
movie or a television show Shes never
even read a book

MARTHA
If shes so innocent how come she
murdered a child

MOTHER MIRIAM
She didnt This is manslaughter not
murder She didnt consciously kill that
baby Shed lost a lot of blood She was
unconscious by the time we got to her

MARTHA
So someone else could have done it

MOTHER MIRIAM
No not in the eyes of the police

MARTHA
And in your eyes

MOTHER MIRIAM
Ive already told you what I thought

MARTHA
That she was unconscious yes So
someone easily could have come in
the room and killed the

MOTHER MIRIAM
You dont really believe something like

that happened do you

MARTHA
Its possible isnt it

MOTHER MIRIAM

Who

MARTHA
One of the other nuns found out about
the baby and and wanted to avoid a
scandal

Mother Miriam removes the tray from under a pot plant and
bangs
it down in front of Martha to act as an ashtray

MOTHER MIRIAM
Thats absurd

MARTHA
That possibility never occurred to
you

MOTHER MIRIAM
No-one knew about Agnes pregnancy

of
whisky froma flask into her cup and an even larger slug into his
own

FATHER MARTINEAU

(French accent)
They arise at five in the morning and
theyre in bed by nine at night Even if a
man could get to them he would probably
find them praying Thats why I see that
the real question is not only how he got in
but when

MARTHA
And youre the only man to see them

FATHER MARTINEAU
I promise you Doctor even if I had the
inclination how could I possibly catch
her She would have to be a very slow
and patient nun

(they both laugh)

Ah no theyre a very special and rare
people those Sisters Only a few of them
left in this modern world consecrated to
the praise of God

Sister Margueri
glances sharply
at her then tu

he sisters are sitting around the table at

towel

MOTHER MIRIAM (V0O)
I should have suspected something

ther Miriam addresses Agnes

MOTHER MIRIAM
Sister Marguerite says you have been
sleeping on a bare mattress Sister
Is that true

AGNES
Yes Mother

MOTHER MIRIAM
Why

AGNES
In the medieval days the nuns and monks
would sleep in their own coffins

te gives a snort of derision Mother Miriam
rns back to Agnes

MOTHER MIRIAM
Were not in the Middle Ages Sister

AGNES
It made them holy

MOTHER MIRIAM
It made them uncomfortable And if

they didnt sleep well Im certain the
next day they were cranky as mules
Sister where are your sheets

(no answer)
Do you really believe that sleeping on
a bare mattress is the equivalent of
sleeping in a coffin

AGNES
No

MOTHER MIRIAM
Then tell me Where are your sheets

AGNES
I burnt them

MOTHER MIRIAM
Why

AGNES
(a long pause)
They were stained

MOTHER MIRIAM
How many times have I burned into
your thick skull and the thick skull
of your fellow novice that
menstruation is a perfectly natural
process and nothing to be ashamed of

AGNES
Yes Mother

MOTHER MIRIAM
Say it

AGNES and GENEVIEVE
It is a perfectly natural process and
nothing to be ashamed of

MOTHER MIRIAM
Mean it

The two girls start to repeat it but Agnes starts to cry and
Genevieve
falters into silence Mother Miriam goes on more kindly

MOTHER MIRIAM
A few years ago one of the Sisters came
to me in tears asking for comfort
comfort because she was too old to
have any children Not that she wanted
to but once a month she had been
reminded of that possibility

AGNES
Its not that its not that

MOTHER MIRIAM
What do you mean

AGNES
Its not my time of month

MOTHER MIRIAM
Should you see a doctor

AGNES
I dont know I dont know what
happened Mother I woke up there

was blood on the sheets but I dont
know what happened
(starts to weep)
I dont know what I did wrong I dont
know and I should be punished

the conception Thats why she burnt
the sheets

continued for any length of time

MARTHA
Why do you call it an investigation

Catherines home before you moved

MONSIGNOR
And you had a sister who died in the
convent

MARTHA
Who told you this

MONSIGNOR
Do you still go to church

MARTHA
What business is it of yours

MONSIGNOR
Oh we just wonder if you can be very
objective about this case

MARTHA
Look Father ah just because I
dont subscribe to the to the beliefs

you subscribe to

MONSIGNOR
(halting)
But what you believe makes no difference
to us whatsoever Doctor But it does

make all the difference to Agnes

MARTHA

myself and God were gone in that one moment

And Saint John would chew tobacco

More laughter then the moment because more serious

MARTHA

Right

(a pause)

What do you suppose todays saints
are smoking

MOTHER MIRIAM
There are no saints today Good people
yes but extraordinarily good people
those Im afraid we are sorely lacking

MARTHA
Do you think they ever existed

MOTHER MIRIAM
Yes I do

MARTHA
Do you want to become one

MOTHER MIRIAM
Become One is born a saint

MARTHA
Well you can try cant you to be good

MOTHER MIRIAM
Yes but goodness has very little to do
with it Not all the saints were good
in fact some of them were a little crazy
But they were still attached to God
Agnes has that birth
(she stands)

No more were born we live we die
No room for miracles

(Martha gets up too)
Oh my dear how I miss the miracles

They start walking back to the convent

MARTHA

My God youre as crazy as

MOTHER MIRIAM
Stop laughing I dont say its the truth
Im saying

MARTHA
How (distorted)

MOTHER MIRIAM
Dont be ridiculous

MARTHA
Well give me a reasonable explanation

MOTHER MIRIAM
A miracle is an event without an
explanation If shes capable of putting
a hole in her hand without benefit of a
nail why couldnt she split a cell in her
womb

This is insane
MOTHER MIRIAM
There as no man in the convent on that
night and no way for any man to get in

Youre saying God did it

MOTHER MIRIAM

No thats as much as saying Father
Martineau did it Im saying God
permitted it

MARTHA
But how did it happen

MOTHER MIRIAM
Youll never find the answer for
everything God did

MARTHA
I thought you didnt believe in miracles
today Mother

MOTHER MIRIAM
But I want the opportunity to believe
I want the choice to believe

MARTHA
But what you are choosing to believe
is a lie because you wont face the fact
that she was raped or seduced
or that she did the seducing

MOTHER MIRIAM
She is an innocent

MARTHA
But she is not an enigma Mother
Everything that Agnes has done is
explainable from modern psychiatry
One two three right down the line

Thats what you believe she is The
sum of her psychological parts

MARTHA
Thats what I have to believe

MOTHER MIRIAM

Youre thinking about her all the time
Youre bent on saving her Why

Martha has no answer

MOTHER MIRIAM (Cont)

You saw it all didnt you

90 EXT - CITY - DAY

A shaft of sunlight shines through the winter clouds onto the
city Angle on the courthouse

91 INT - COURT ROOM - DAY
All the main characters are present Eve Lyon Martha

Agnes
Sister Marguerite and Mother Miriam Justice Leveau is summing
up

LEVEAU
In view of the situation as it now
stands and the testimony given here
this morning it seems quite clear
that the defendant was in no manner
responsible for her actions It is
therefore the judgement of this court
that she be returned to the convent of
Marie Madeleine where she will be cared
for under proper medical supervision by
a visiting physician

Both Martha and Mother Miriam show relief at this Justice
Leveau continues
to sum up in French when suddenly Agnes stands up

LEVEAU (Cont)
(surprised)
Oui Do you have something to say

AGNES
(a long pause)
I stood in the window of my room
every night for a week And one night
I heard the most beautiful voice
imaginable And when I looked I saw
the moon shining down on him For six
nights he sang to me songs Id never
heard And on the seventh night he
opened his wings and lay on top of me
All the while he sang -

(sings)
Charlie Sweet Charlie Sweet
Charlies a

LEVEAU
Please remove her from the court

Martha and Mother Miriam step forward uncertainly

LEVEAU
Would someone please remove the
defendant from the courtroom
(continues in French)

The nuns lead Agnes still singing past Martha and out of the
court

DISSOLVE TO
92 EXT - CONVENT - DAY

It is full winter many shots of the convent and surroundings

dissolving
into one another

MARTHA (VO)
I dont know the meaning behind the
song she sang Perhaps it was a song
of seduction And the father was a
fieldhand Perhaps the song was simply
a lullaby that she remembered from many
years ago And the father was hope and
and love and desire And a belief in
miracles

The nuns are seen walking together through the snow back to

the
convent over which Agnes singing can be heard

MARTHA (VO)
I want to believe that she was blessed
And I do miss her and I hope that shes
left something some little part of
herself with me That would be miracle
enough wouldnt it

DISSOLVE TO
93 EXT - TOP OF BELLTOWER - DAY

Where Agnes is singing her song among the doves She stops
singing and the music fades in on the same key Agnes gently takes
on of the doves and lets

it fly away across the snowy landscape

FADE OUT
