FADE IN
INT PROFESSOR OCKS PRIVATE PHYSICS LABORATORY THE
CYCLOTRON ROOM (CREDIT SEQUENCE) - DAY

A mighty WARNING KLAXON assaults our ears A FLASHING RED
WARNING LIGHT stabs our eyes

Several DIALS go into the RED A hand pushes aside a
YELLOW THERMOS and pushes forward a RED POWER THROTTLE
We hear the WHINING UP of a cyclotron A DIGITAL DIAL
climbs to 5 POWER A SPIDER crawls across a DIAL

Begin OPENING CREDITS

THE CYCLOTRON ROOM is in an old basement full of peeling
paint and plumbing wrapped with TAPE Leaks are here and
there COBWEBS are all around

DOCTOR OTTO OCTAVIUS (OCK) is a strong but strange
featured man in his mid-fifties

His assistant WEINER hovers nearby looking on Hes
open mouthed with a mindless kind of curiosity WEINER is
a local small-time hood hired by OCK to circumvent the
school administration and to procure whatever OCK needs
for his experiments He shades his eyes against a searing
BLUE-WHITE BEAM that erupts from the WINDOW THE ROOM IS
DIVIDED INTO A CONTROL ROOM AND THE EXPERIMENT CHAMBERS
WEINER
Whoa whoa whoa whats that

With a WHOOSH the WINDOW EXPLODES showering the TWO with
shards of GLASS and throwing them to the floor

OCK
(rising)
We begin again lets kick in that new
transducer See if we can double the
power output

WEINER
(rising more slowly)
Whoa Doc wait a minute

But OCK is already at the THROTTLE The cyclotron whirls
up The lights go on Louder brighter than before OCK
looks through the broken WINDOW into the EXPERIMENTAL
CHAMBER The POWER DIAL inches upward eight nine
the BLUE-WHITE LIGHT is blinding now The WHINE pitch is
shattering

END OPENING CREDITS

OCK
Okey dokey

The POWER DIAL hits ten
EXT EMPIRE STATE UNIVERSITY - DAY

As STUDENTS go to class the sound of the cyclotron spills
out of the SCIENCE CENTER onto the grounds of Empire State
University

We see PETER PARKER a pleasant faced senior whos among
the top in his class Sincere and serious he has yet to
develop a way with women

LIZ
(falling in step)
Hiya Peter

LIZ ALLEN is also a senior Shes beautiful and
intelligent

PETER
(ardent but
uncomfortable)
Hiya Liz howre you doing
LIZ
(teasing softly)
Howm I doing what

HARRY
Peter Peter Wait up

HARRY is the school nerd A quirky kid who like PETER
can be a little backward around girls especially pretty
ones like Liz

HARRY
(to Liz)
Would you uh excuse us for a minute

Despite PETERS protesting body language HARRY pulls him
away like a conspirator

PETER
What is it what

HARRY
Did the Astro-Physics Journal really
accept your paper

PETER
(laughs embarrassed)
Yeah well all I gots the data but
theyve agreed to publish it when its
finished You know its my
calculation on the Planetary Conjunction

HARRY
And its influence on the anti-force
Isnt it

PETER

Yes Look Harry I am busy with
(indicates Liz standing
there)

HARRY
Yeah you and the rest of the class
Every one is busy with Liz

LIZ
(growing impatient)

Peter

A HAND reaches in and smacks her bottom
FLASH
Hiya cupcakes

LIZ
(elbowing him
affectionately)
Flash

They kiss and walk away

HARRY
(sneering)
And Flash is the busiest of them all

PETER
(disappointed)
Come on Harry well be late for
Octavius

HARRY makes a gesture dismissing OCK as crazy

HARRY
Ock is nuts dont you agree

PETER
Ock is a genius Harry Crazy Yes But
a genius misunderstood and unappreciated

INT CYCLOTRON AREA HALLWAY - DAY

It is a basement hallway full of LOCKERS which STUDENTS
are banging open and shut as they put stuff in and take
stuff out In their midst a MAN is banging on the door
marked Cyclotron Room - Authorized Personnel Only
Professor ROSOMORF SIXTISH respectable a good old
fashioned professor hes the head of the Physics Dept
With him is ALEXANDER THORKEL a 40-ish Waspish school
administrator For a scientist as crazily focused as OCK
THORKEL is a natural enemy

ROZ
(knocking furiously)
Doctor Octavius You are late for your
lecture The students are waiting
Doctor Octavius

THORKEL
Your friend is impossible Professor
Rosomorf I told the board we should let
him go

The LIGHT above THORKELs head EXPLODES Then all the
LIGHTS behind him EXPLODE in succession THORKEL and ROZ
look amazed

THORKEL
Whats he doing in there not his crazy
experiment again

ROZ
You mean his anti-force theory one day
theyll give him the Nobel Prize for it

THORKEL
Meanwhile he is demolishing our
university Octavius
(knocks)
Open the door

INT OCKS LAB

OCK

he anti-force experiment has now reached
he limit of electronic overload safety
herefore Weiner you will disconnect

T
t
T
the overload safety device

FOUR WALDOS (three-fingered snake-like mechanical arms)
suddenly thrust themselves into the CHAMBER and begin
working each at a different task OCK is an acknowledged
master at manipulating these WALDOS

He flicks a switch and a searing BLUE-WHITE BEAM lances
down from a FOCUSING CONE and strikes a GRAM WEIGHT
marked 1000000) illuminating it and filling our
ears with a splitting BUZZ TONE

The knock on the door grows louder
WEINER comes up behind OCK

WEINER
Whoa Doc someones at the door
OCK
(ignoring)

World class scientific mind and they
stick me in the basement with this third
rate cyclotron

INSERT The DIAL marked RELATIVE GRAVITY reads
1000000 but suddenly it snaps to 0999999

OCK
Okey Dokey
The WEIGHT begins to jiggle and for an instant it
appears to lift ever so slightly

INT COLLEGE PHYSICS LAB - DAY

This is an enormous room 100 lab tables The yellowing
smoke of a thousand experiments hangs in the air A HUGE
AMERICAN FLAG dominates the back wall

PETER HARRY and LIZ set up their TABLES FLASH reads the
DAILY BUGLE sports section PETER cant take his eyes off
LIZ When she looks back he looks down at his GEAR

LIZ
(softly)
What is it Peter

PETER
(embarrassed)
Its nothing

INT OCKS LAB

WEINER opens the door and sees ROZ and THORKEL waiting
impatient

WEINER
Yes gentleman can I help you

THORKEL
Tell your boss that his class is waiting

WEINER
(looks)
You better tell him yourself

THORKEL looks at ROZ who waves his shoulder then the both
call

ROZ and THORKEL
Professor Octavius

Professor OCK turns and looks at the bewildered men

OCK
Gentlemen come you must see this

ROZ
But your students

OCK
The imbeciles can wait I have better
things to do than teach introductory
Physics Rosomorf Undergrads are
kindless adolescence

THORKEL
You see he is impossible

OCK
Thorkel you are the dummiest
administrator our university has ever had
(Thorkel turns to go)
Dont go Thorkel Come Look

He starts to play his machines handles and buttons

THORKEL
The university pays you to teach
something to your students

INT COLLEGE PHYSICS LAB - DAY

LIZ
Well do you mean nothing or do you
mean something but you wont tell me what
it is
PETER
(regaining)

I mean plain nothing

LIZ
Well I guess thats about as nothing as
you can get plain nothing
A beat
PETER
Liz
LIZ

Ahh it is something

PETER
No look

The equipment on her TABLE is starting to vibrate They
look at it curiously We hear the cyclotrons WHINE
begin to build

INT CYCLOTRON ROOM - DAY

Everything is shaking like in an earthquake Roz and
Thorkel seem to dance in their place going crazy with
anger and surprise The WHINE is deafening The light is
blinding WEINER has his eyes closed and his hands over
his ears

OCK
I am going for 20 percent power

THORKEL
NO Dont do that

ROZ
Ock Its dangerous

THORKEL
Ock I warn you

WEINER crosses himself The CONSOLE erupts in sparks
INT ELECTRICAL CONDUIT MONTAGE - DAY

We follow the electrical overcharge as it crackles along
the WIRES and CABLES inside the WALLS and FLOORS It is
making its way up to the LAB

INT LAB - DAY

All the kids are now trying to hold onto their vibrating
equipment

The CHARGE crackles up a WIRE and erupts at LIZS TABLE
A BREAKER explodes in flames There is an outburst of AD
LIBS Fire Everybody out

THORKEL (comes running he is shabby and bewildered) seeing
LIZ trapped behind the fire which is growing from second
to second

THORKEL
eep calm everybody keep calm Use the
front door Everybody out the front

PETER
Liz Come on

LIZ
cant Help me

PETER

m coming

He wades into the fire but is beaten back by the FLAMES
His sleeve is on fire He pats it out

LIZ
Peter

Flash appears and tries to help but Thorkel stops him

THORKEL
Get back you idiots You cant go in
there

LIZ smashes at the WINDOW but this is an inner city
school and the WINDOWS are covered by STEEL GATES Liz
wraps her fingers in the GATE

LIZ
(out at the street)
Help Help me

Outside the WINDOW the air is clear and people come and
go Some are stopping to look up at the girl on the
second floor who screams (but they cant hear of course)
down at them as the FLAMES close in behind her

PETER comes flying in with a FIRE EXTINGUISHER He
fumbles with it FLASH pushes Thorkel grabs the
extinguisher away from him with a scowl of disdain
LIZ turns to face the FLAMES Suddenly there is an
eruption of CO2 CLOUDS and the roar of a FIRE
EXTINGUISHER

The FLAMES are beaten down enough for her to leap out
FLASH is there holding the EXTINGUISHER People CHEER

PETER
Thanks for your help Flash

FLASH
No problem wimp

PETER
Our hero has a real way with words

LIZ
Oh why dont you grow up

PETER is stung insulted turns away
ROSOMORF peeps in worried -- faces Thorkel

THORKEL
This man will bring a disaster upon this
university
OCK comes in starts his lecture calmly as if nothing has
happened

OCK
The universe is made up of forces and
counter-forces Science is the study of
the forces

FLASH hands the EXTINGUISHER to PETER LIZ embraces
FLASH throwing a glimpse at PETER who tried so bravely
He looks away and turns the last of the EXTINGUISHER on
the last of the FIRE

OCK
(continues without a
hitch)
But I Professor Otto Octavius have

devoted my life to the study of the
counter-forces Good job Peter

PETER
(taking place at lab
table)
Thanks Professor

THORKEL has walked slowly and uncomprehendingly toward the
front of the huge LAB He simply cannot believe OCKS
behavior

THORKEL
I dont believe it I simply dont

OcK
Can we carry on Mr Thorkel

THORKEL
I dont believe oh all right carry on
Professor

OCK

Well This week my dear students I have
made a stunning breakthrough

THORKEL
Wait a minute wait a minute youve
got fire forms to fill out Dr Octavius

OCK
I have no time for forms or
administrators who persist in
interrupting me Mr Thorkel
THORKEL steams out and bangs shut the DOOR

OCK
now believe its possible that these
counter forces can be collected the
way the magnifying glass collects the
sunlight and focused into a hard beam
call Weiner

WEINER backs away from the BLACKBOARD to reveal a word
that OCK has scrawled in large letters It says Anti-
Force

OCK
call it the Anti-Force

OCK is plugging a HUGE CABLE into a small LUCITE BOX with
a SILVER BALL inside it

OCK
(continues as he works)
This anti-force once harnessed is
capable of undoing any natural force at
which it is aimed for instance
(looks up maniacally)
Gravity

LIZ scribbles down a note and mouths the word gravity
Then she turns to PETER

LIZ
(whispers)
Im sorry
PETER

Its alright

OCK is playing his COMPUTER like the Phantom of the
Opera at the organ

OcK
We patch in the cyclotron
The lights flicker and go dim

OCK
Pay no attention to the lights I of
course steal its energy and it looses
power We patch in the cyclotron and

we gradually apply power The power that
I am stealing
As the WHINE builds in the LAB
OCK peers through the LUCITE BOX at us distorted by it

The BOX is a miniature version of the cyclotrons
experimental chamber and now the BLUE-WHITE glow begins
It crackles round the SILVER BALL

OCK
And so we stand four square against the
fundamental force that orders and

maintains our universe gravity
which is holding down this goddamn ball
Rise

The LIGHTS go totally dark The kids react with WHOOPS
and CATCALLS

HARRY
What a crock
PETER
Shut up Harry this is very interesting
OCK
Mr Parker Have you some interesting
observation youd like to share with the
class
PETER
No sir
OCK

Then shut up And pay some attention to
the experiment

OCK peers at us through the LUCITE BOX as the SILVER BALL
begins to rise OCKS face is ecstatic

OCK
Rise Rise

The SILVER BALL suddenly shoots up shattering the top of

the box It flies up to the ceiling where it shatters a
LIGHT FIXTURE

The shards rain down on OCK who reaches out and catches
the falling BALL and scales it in a raised fist

OCK
Now thats what I call an experiment

The CYCLOTRON WHINE cuts out and OCK wheels to the
COMPUTER He hits a KEY and several COLORED PROJECTION
BEAMS lance out of the back of the room They pierce the
smoke and light a PROJECTION DISPLAY in the front

TWO COLORED SPHERES one YELLOW one BLUE touch where
their circumferences meet Behind them is a BLACK
depiction of space

OCK
You are looking at a representation of
two universes Our Blue one Our real
universe something we can touch and
feel and see and draw calculations about
This is us The Yellow universe this
is something else Some other dimension
something on the other side

OCK hits another COMPUTER KEY and a hole appears where the
TWO SPHERES touch The BLUE AND THE YELLOW MARBLEIZE with
each other The colors swirl until both SPHERES are

BRIGHT GREEN

OCK
If it were possible to generate enough
power behind it the anti-force could

wipe out not just gravity but all our
universal forces at the same time In
effect it would blast a hole between

this universe and the next Each

(indicates green spheres)
would flow into each other No blue
universe No yellow End finished
over

LIZ
(with a students ear)
That sounds like a scenario for the end
of the world

OCK
My girl it is It is It would mean
wiping out everything thats known and

letting in everything thats unknown

FLASH
Isnt that a little dangerous

OCK
Dont worry yourself true inter-
dimensional penetration is still purely
theoretical but one day Maybe very
near maybe in the 21st century
INT BASEMENT HALLWAY - DAY

PETER LIZ FLASH and HARRY all take BOOKS from their
LOCKERS

LIZ
(whispers to Peter)
Look its just I dont know when
you and Flash go after each other like
that
PETER
(whispers)

Hes not my type

LIZ
He doesnt have to be

PETER
Check

LIZ
And besides hes not all bad

PETER looks at FLASH whos a few LOCKERS down FLASH has
taken a FOOTBALL from his LOCKER and is spinning it on his
finger with great joy and concentration

PETER
You dont get nicknamed Flash because
youre a rocket scientist Liz

LIZ
Give it up Parker Youd die for a
nickname like Flash

PETER
Yeah of embarrassment

KIM comes by and leans seductively by her LOCKER KIM is
a ripe one and hot-hot-hot

KIM
(teasing)
Hey Flash Im scalping a pair of the
Midnight Madness Wrestling Match tomorrow
night
FLASH

The Slammies Id kill for that
KIM
Would you pay 125

FLASH
Well uh I gee if can I tell
you tomorrow

KIM

(moving on)
You snooze you lose Hiya Liz

LIZ
Kim you know Peter and Harry This is
my new roommate Kim Nickson

KIM is pulling her pet a foot long SALAMANDER out of her
LOCKER She wraps it around her neck and turns to the
boys

They go bug-eyed

KIM
(interested)
Hellooo Peter

PETER
(embarrassed)
Hi

LIZ
Were going to the Student Reunion
Meeting You coming

Peter looks at KIM Wow Then he looks at LIZ whos
adjusting herself in a small MIRROR HARRY jabs him in
the ribs Yeah yeah

PETER
(frustrated)
I cant I gotta go over to the Daily
Bugle Im trying to sell some photos

KIM
Soooh a photographer

PETER
Just an amateur Well nice meeting
you Kim

KIM

Yeah I bet it would be
HARRY
Can I be your date for the reunion
ShooShoo

KIM
No Jerk

HARRY
(she turns to go)
What did I say

LIZ
Its not what you said its how you say
it ShooShoo

Everybody leaves and Harry is left alone he throws his
bag down

HARRY
Damn

PETER turns to go and comes face to face with the hulking
WEINER

WEINER
Peter Doc Ock wants to see you

PETER
About my data I bet

WEINER
I dont know

PETER
He knows about my work on the Planetary
Conjunction doesnt he

WEINER
(lies)
I dont know

INT CONTROL ROOM - DAY

PETER enters wide-eyed behind WEINER This place is a far
cry from the experiment in the LAB ROOM Its a fantastic
netherworld to which no undergrad gains entrance No one
but PETER

OCK is sitting in a swivel CHAIR with his back to PETER
He has the look of Captain Nemo in his Nautilus This is
OCKS domain
PETER
Hello Professor Octavius
(no response)
I really admired your experiment

OCK
(back to Peter)
We have a lot of interests in common
Peter Perhaps we should put our heads
together if you know what I mean

PETER
(flattered)
That would be great

OCK

(turns with a smile)
Now you take the Planetary Conjunction
This Saturday night we will witness
Saturn Jupiter the Moon the Earth the
Sun all in a row Never seen within
the memory of man or measured for its
effect The total gravitational force
must be quite exceptional Isnt that
the subject of your paper

PETER
Yes sir Ive worked out a new way to
calculate the combined gravitational
effect

OCK
Im a busy man Mr Parker But I think
I could find the time to go over it with

you Make sure it all checks out
PETER
Well Im sort of working with

Professor Rosomorf and he suggested we
kind of keep it between us He thinks
that my theory is well I dont know

OCK
(to himself)
The scoundrel
(turns angry)
I want to see that data Peter

PETER
But Professor Octavius if I knew you
were interested sorry Ive already

given it to Professor Rosomorf and he
is after all the head of our Physics
Department and I couldnt

OCK turns sweet again He smiles too broadly

OCK
Well Im certain something can be worked
out Run along young man

PETER begins to leave

OCK
Just a minute how about if I show you
my discoveries something I never
showed to any other student asa
matter of fact to anybody at all

PETER
Well I am really flattered I mean Id
love to but I

OCK
Very well shall we say if you come here
tonight

PETER

But Professor I dont now if I should

OCK
Make it eight sharp Ill be waiting
for you Right here

Peter looks worried then leaves
OCK turns to WEINER who slouches against the wall smiling

OCK
The same academic world thats so keen to
embrace that boys undergraduate work
ridicules my anti-force theory as
quackery I ask you Weiner what is
our society coming to Ha

WEINER
They are all a bunch of brainless
assholes thats what I say

OCK
Weiner Go get me that boys data

WEINER
Cost you fifty bucks
OCK
(Weiner hissing)
Just get it Well negotiate your fee
when you have the data alright Weiner

EXT DAILY BUGLE - DAY

Establish as ART DECO BUILDING well beyond its prime A
sign says The Daily Bugle Peter enters the building

JAMESON (VO)
Garbage Absolute 100 garbage

INT JAMESONS OFFICE - DAY

Very forties very messy J Jameson scans some PHOTOS as
PETER stands helplessly by

JAMESON
Bag ladies I hate bag ladies

PETER
Yes sir

JAMESON is 50ish grey at the temples brush cut on top
He too is forties His chewed up CIGAR is forties This
guy is a hard case

JAMESON
(looks at the other photos)
Little kids I hate little kids This

is a daily newspaper We need news value
photographs not artsy-fartsy shit

PETER
Yes sir

JAMESON comes to a picture of a BUSINESS SUITED MAN with
MOHAWK PETER smiles in anticipation

JAMESON
Kid You want a pros assessment

PETER
Yes sir

JAMESON
(handing photos back)
Your photos suck
(cigar for emphasis)
Parker my readers are morons I gotta
grab them by the eyes Every time you
press the button of that Nikon of yours
it costs you fifty-five cents So the
next time youre about to take the plunge
ask yourself am I taking dog bites man
Because if you are

PETER
I know I know You want man bites dog

JAMESON
Parker this is the post modern 20th
century I want man eats dog Get out

EXT STREET - DAY

A seedy east village walk up Peter takes his camera and
takes various shots of a wino ALL IN He climbs the
stairs to his building looks through the mail he
collects from a beaten down mailbox

PETER
(reading)
Rent Rent more bills rent
electricity bills

INT PETERS APARTMENT - DAY

A one-room shabby roof apartment a chaos of books and
papers A photo enlarger and darkroom baths in kitchen
pots 8xl0s tacked to the walls a spare camera and
lenses Self-consciously wacky kitsch plastic dinosaurs
wind-up toys a stuffed carp An unmade bed and a 50s
dinette set are the only furniture A grimy skylight
leads to the roof Its not a pretty place but it has
personality A voice from the kitchen a shadow of an
intruder is sneaking around

PETER
Theres nothing in there worth stealing

MAY (VO)
(from within the kitchen)
Thats the understatement of the year

PETER
Aunt May youre trespassing

MAY
(comes in)
I was just so desperately bored I
thought Id come over and make you dinner
PETER
I am old enough to to make my own--

MAY
But I didnt feel like getting to know
your roaches

PETER
Ill introduce you

MAY
Oh And those foul chemicals in the pots

PETER
I take pictures remember

MAY
Anyway Ive decided to kidnap you for
dinner in Forest Hills

She grabs her coat crosses back to Peter and tugs on his
shoulder

PETER
Its Friday night

MAY
Yes Do you have a date

PETER
No

MAY
Then come on

INT LARGE COMPUTER LAB - NIGHT

It is dark and empty except for COMPUTERS Sitting at it
lit by the GLOW of its screen is SOLOMON ROSOMORF (ROZ)
As he works a DOOR opens behind him Someone walks
quietly through the LAB ROSOMORF keeps working The
intruder approaches

THORKEL
(at his ear)
Professor Rosomorf what happened here

ROZ
Someone tried to rob me of some paper
I suspect they were looking for that one
THORKEL
What is it

ROZ
(unruffled)
Award winning stuff
(turning slightly)
Peter Parkers data on the Planetary
Conjunction Damn lucky I hid it in my
computer under another title

THORKEL
My God whats going on in our school
First Professor Octavius almost blows up
the Physics lab Now this You report
it in triplicate of course

ROZ
Thorkel be careful when you talk to
Octavius Remember the man is a very

fragile genius One day hell bring us
all the Noble Prize

THORKEL
Rosomorf the man is a very dangerous
crackpot

Off screen the voice of the CYCLOTRON WHINE begins to
build

ROZ
Thats him again Hes working day and
night

THORKEL

I tell you the man is very dangerous
(the whine grows louder)

Come on Rosomorf lets stop him before

this building will explode

INT CYCLOTRON ROOM - NIGHT

OCK and WEINER are at work as before OCK takes no notice
of the TWO MEN who come in nor the WORKER who comes in
behind them and sets to work attaching a BIG LOCK to the
door

THORKEL
Shut it down Octavius

OCK ignores him WEINER touches OCKS shoulder OCK
ignores him too
THORKEL
Youve blown half the circuits in the
Science Center

OCK
Call an electrician

THORKEL
I have called the locksmith

OCK
What what is he doing

He points toward the worker whos working on the lock on
the main door

THORKEL
We have to shut your lab down and take a
look at the lines

ROZ
Please Otto we must lock it up

OCK
(to Thorkel)
Youre denying me access to my cyclotron

THORKEL
You bet

OCK glares back and forth between the TWO MEN the WORKER
and WEINER Then he pulls BACK the RED POWER THROTTLE

The WHINE descends

The WALDOS pull back and dangle from their panel The
WHINE dies

OCK
(contemplating)
Okey dokey just give me till tomorrow
I want to clean up my papers Tomorrow
Ha Tomorrow you can have this room
ROZ
Oh well Thorkel few more hours

wont make a difference

THORKEL
I hope
He signals to the worker to stop
INT APARTMENT OF AUNT MAY AND UNCLE BEN - NIGHT

The NY Mets are playing baseball on TV PETER watches
with his UNCLE BEN a paunchy 65 years old in POLYESTER
SLACKS and a COMFY OLD SWEATER A NY METS CAP is
perched on BENS head A BEER CAN is in his hand A
cluttered but familiar living room sprawls comfortably
around them

BEN
Another brewski

PETER
No Im fine Uncle Ben

BEN
(at TV)
Yah Way to do it Alright
(to Peter)
You dont follow the Mets like you used
to do you Pete

PETER
No not so much anymore

BEN
Funny When your Mom and Dad uh passed
away I had this idea I wanted you

to be the best baseball player that ever
was Geez what ever happened to that

PETER
Little league

BEN
(soft and warm)
Yeah Babe Ruth you wasnt
AUNT MAY enters
AUNT MAY

Its on the table Turn off the TV

BEN nods rises sluggishly and slowly and turns the sound
off only PETER moves toward his AUNT in the doorway

AUNT MAY
Hows that girl you told us about Peter

PETER
Liz Shes great But she has a
boyfriend

INT THE DINING ROOM - NIGHT
PETER passes AUNT MAY and takes his seat

AUNT MAY
A boy your age should have a girlfriend

PETER
Aunt May she has a steady boyfriend

AUNT MAY
Peter any girl thats worth your
attention is of course gonna have a
boyfriend But if she really gets to
now what you have to offer shell you
get my drift

BEN
Look just leave him alone okay When
hes ready for girls hell be a holy
terror

(winks)
ts in the blood

(now serious business)
Lookit how are you fixed for money
Pete Maybe I can help you out a little

PETER

(lying to them)
No Im alright My scholarship covers
almost everything and I sell some photos
here and there Today my physics
professor asked for some of my work he
wants to study my data They might
publish my work in the science magazine
thatll bring me some money

BEN
(practically cheering)
Publish your work You hear that May

PETER
(embarrassed laughs)
Yeah in fact I have to leave a little
early tonight to meet Professor
Octavius He offered me to be his
assistant

BEN
Whoa Did you hear that May

AUNT MAY
Oh Peter you promised youd spend the
night

PETER
I I cant Aunt May Professor
Octavius wants to discuss my new
findings

AUNT MAY

(disappointed)

Peter what you should be finding isa

nice girlfriend
INT BASEMENT CYCLOTRON ROOM - NIGHT

WEINER is eating a large SANDWICH and a drinking a COKE

OCK
Ill show them closing the cyclotron
on me Weiner

WEINER

Yes Professor

OCK
Where is he Its ten past eight oclock

A KNOCK

WEINER
(with mouth full)
That must be him
He opens the door

PETER
Good evening

OCK
You are late
(to Weiner)
Weiner go outside and get us something
to eat And dont steal it Just buy it
Ill reimburse you

WEINER
(to Peter)
Do you want anything Parker

PETER
No thank you I just had dinner at my
aunts

OCK
Piss off Weiner

WEINER leaves PETER wanders around

He goes into the experimental chamber he overlooks the
SPIDER which is scuttling away and crawls inside the open

WINDOW and into the chamber
OCK
Okey dokey Parker how would you like
to take Weiners place I mean be my
assistant
PETER

Well Professor that would be a great
honor but Im already working with

OCK
Rosomorf that imbecile Dont you
understand kid that I am about to
uncover the greatest discovery since
Einstein came up with his theory of
relativity The Anti-Force

PETER
Wow The theory of the Anti-force You
should go for the Noble Prize Professor

OCK

Noble Shmoble I am going for a much
bigger prize kid Okey dokey Let me
show you kid what I got here

OCK begins the experiment We move in past the shattered
WINDOW We see the SPIDER crawling on the chambers GEAR

OCK

Present maximum anti-force power to date
is 38 percent of theoretical limit I
have patched in the variable
particle-wave accelerator

(shrugs)
I will now try to reach 50 power

(big breath)
And if your paper has any value I can
use it to get the power Im missing to
create the anti-force to break through
and beat any other form of power in our
or any other universe capish

PETER
Sorry Professor I cant do it I gave
my word to Professor Rosomorf

OCK is angry Ock now sees the SPIDER He shoots out a

WALDO to try and crush it but the SPIDER is too fast The
WALDO slams against the wall of the chamber He starts to

starts

An URGENT WARNING TONE causes OCK to look at the Relative
Gravity DIAL It is at 4999999KG but suddenly the
numbers start to tumble rapidly

INSERT The glowing 5KG WEIGHT
INSERT The POWER DIAL inches toward 50 POWER

PETER leaves

Another URGENT WARNING TONE causes OCK to look at the
monitor SCREEN On it flashing RED is the word
OVERLOAD OCK pushes the RED POWER THROTTLE forward
The WHINE increases to a PULSE and THROB

INT EXPERIMENTAL CHAMBER - NIGHT

Incredibly lit the SPIDER is dropping on its shimmering
WEB-STRAND down toward the 5KG WEIGHT which now GLOWS in
time with the THROB and PULSE

INT THE CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT

The MONITOR is flashing MAXIMUM OVERLOAD - SHUT DOWN
OCK continues with the experiment And then he sees the
SPIDER

OCK
You Get out of there you creeping
He tries to shove the SPIDER with his hand
INT EXPERIMENTAL CHAMBER - NIGHT

Through the BLUE-WHITE we can barely make out OCK on the
other side if the shattered WINDOW He sends TWO WALDOS
after the SPIDER The SPIDER evades him and jumps onto
the PROFESSORs back It then climbs onto the PROFESSORs
neck and bites him

OCK
(anguish)
Nooooo00000000

The gravity DIAL goes to 000001 then pops back up as
OCKS tiny world goes berserk DIALS spin crack explode
or droop liquidly WIRES dance on the CONSOLE which
erupts like the 4th of JULY

OCK begins to float His shirt begins to tear away A
DIAL floats by with its pulled WIRES undulating like a
Medusa WALDOS smash through the walls and flail like
snakes OCKS YELLOW THERMOS distorts and EXPLODES

OCK his hair wild face locked in a multi-G grimace is
pinned halfway up a wall that is showering the room with
SPARKS

OCK
(ecstasy above the din)
Its an energy storm Okey Dokey

We see clearly the SPIDER still stuck to his neck

The big beast buffets and shakes Tubes junctions
valves and whatnot fall off crashing to the floor where
they twitch and writhe with a life of their own

Then an enormous EXPLOSION rips a large hole in the
CYCLOTRONs side sending debris and a HUNDRED MICRO-
STREAMS of ELECTRONIC PARTICLES lancing in our direction

INT BASEMENT HALLWAY - NIGHT

Ultimate weirdness The PULSING BLUE-WHITE LIGHT
penetrates first the DOOR of the CYCLOTRON ROOM and then
the very walls LOCKERS bang LAMPS POP the ceiling sags
in a SURREAL RUBBERY way

The WALLS sag too The CYCLOTRON SIGN pivots and embeds
itself in a WALL A LADDER sinks in the WALL The BLUE-
WHITE LIGHT dances wildly about in PULSES Then
suddenly it stops DEAD SILENCE WEINER comes running
in holding a double decker sandwich and a large bottle of
Pepsi Weiner enters OCKS lab singing not at first
noticing whats going on Suddenly he stops dead

INT CYCLOTRON ROOM - NIGHT

A scene out of DALIs surrealistic canvas There are
things inside of other things DIALS look like DALI
watches This place has been rippled to the max

OCK lays face up unconscious on the floor a WALDO across
his chest The SPIDER is weaving its web CAMERA slowly
DOWN to see OCK PIPES and WIRES are stuck to his body
The WALDO seems to be wrapping him He wakes up to see
those MECHANICAL ARMS buried in his body They weave
around him as if they are looking for prey He tries to
tear them out but they seem to be a part of his body
like his other limbs He screams Suddenly Weiner sees
OCK

WEINER
Professor what happened to you What
did you do

Suddenly one of the waldos hits him so strongly that he
flies back and out through the door to the corridor

INT BASEMENT HALLWAY - NIGHT

WEINER
Oh my God what happened here

He hears the police sirens approaching he runs away

WEINER
I better get out of here

EXT THE EMPIRE UNIVERSITY - NIGHT

The long SCREAM segues to a POLICE SIREN A COP CAR pulls
to a halt in front of the COLLEGE Many NYPD CARS are
already there along with a NUCLEAR REGULATORY VAN some
AMBULANCES a VAN from the ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY
and TWO TV VANS ROZ runs across the lawn

POLICE STRUGGLE to hold back the crowd of press students
and general gawkers

J JAMESON pushes to the front of the mob in time to see
TWO COPS hustle a BUGLE PHOTOGRAPHER back into it

The MAN shakes his head JAMESON throws down his CIGAR
stomps it and pulls out a fresh one THORKEL arrives to
address the CROWD

THORKEL

EXT SCIENCE CENTER - NIGHT

PETER approaches a CYCLONE FENCE keeping low and out of
sight He leaps it like a skirmisher but fails
ignominiously in a heap Hes torn his PANTS and cut his
leg He moves to the side of the building

A DUMPSTER sits next to a FIRE DOOR Its locked As
PETER mulls over his next move the LOCK clicks and the
DOOR slowly opens PETER leaps on the DUMPSTER and
falls in

INT DUMPSTER - NIGHT

PETER lays in the GARBAGE a pained look on his face He
rolls over and comes face to face with a wet DAILY BUGLE
The headline reads Wave of Violence Rips City He pulls
himself up and peers out

He sees a UNIFORMED GUARD hold the DOOR open for THREE MEN
IN RADIATION SUITS who remove some weirdly fused objects
When they let the DOOR swing closed PETER stops it by
inserting the NEWSPAPER in the top

EXT FIRE DOOR - NIGHT

PETER squeezes inside and jumps to knock out the
NEWSPAPER The Door closes behind him

INT BASEMENT HALLWAY - NIGHT
Skewed strange surreal PETER stares at the weirdness
and fumbles with his CAMERA He snaps off a few shots
then freezes when he hears a familiar voice

ROZ (VO)
(filtered through face mask)
Take it easy Take it easy with him

THORKEL (VO)
Take him away and never bring him back

Now we see ROZ and THORKEL following 2 GUARDS carrying OCK
in a stretcher They all wear RADIATION SUITS A waldo
sneaks out from under the sheet and hits Thorkel as fast
as lightning He falls back Hes covered with a SHEET

and attached to LIFE SUPPORT EQUIPMENT Octavius moans

THORKEL
What was that

ROZ
What was what

THORKEL
What hit me

ROZ

What hit you

THORKEL
I dont know It was so fast

ROZ

PETER gets off a shot and ducks into the MENS room
leaving the DOOR ajar for a peak

A WALDO slips down from the SHEET PETERS eyes go wide
at the sight What in the hell has happened here

INT MENS ROOM - NIGHT

The URINALS are twisted in bizarre shapes PIPES are
exposed and spout WATER The MIRRORS look like something
out of a funhouse PETER hears the STRETCHER go by

PETER goes to the DOOR of OCKS Lab and cracks it PAN up
to the SPIDER GLOWING softly dangling from a SHIMMERING
STRAND above PETER

As PETER looks out at the STRETCHER the SPIDER drops on
his neck He reacts by swatting it away Bad move
The GLOWING SPIDER now squats malevolently on the back of
PETERs hand He stares at it transfixed It bites

PETER
Ow

PETER throws the SPIDER to the ripply tile floor where it
scuttles unsteadily out the door

Sweat starts to bead on PETERS face He shakes his head
to clear it His vision becomes uncertain He lurches
against a WEIRD SINK

PETERS POV is not just uncertain not just fuzzy not
just moving in and out anamorphically Its all of that

GUARD (VO)
(heavily distorted)
Hey What are you doing here kid

PETER turns to see a UNIFORMED GUARD distorted by his
crazy vision

PETER
I feel a little funny

GUARD
(heavily distorted)
Yeah Well I aint laughing Get out
Just get out of here

EXT FIRE DOOR - NIGHT

It bangs open The GUARD throws PETER out and then throws
his BACK PACK at him

GUARD
(still distorted)
You get yourself over to the Police lines

PETER
(ultra wooz)
Right Police lines

EXT UNIVERSITY - NIGHT

PETER melds into the crowd As in a dream JAMESON
appears at his side

JAMESON
(distorted)
Okay scoop whaddaya got

PETER
I got pictures of the Professor in

bizarre

JAMESON

(winks)
Good job kid Bizarre is what we need
Pick this up in the morning

(holding up his camera)
Therell be two crisp twenties tucked
inside

He hurries off PETER peers after him and all of a sudden
his vision corrects to a perfect focus The sweat is
gone Hes okay He makes his way through the crowd to
the street

We TRACK with PETER as the madding throng recedes behind
him He turns a corner He hears a SIREN

An AMBULANCE screeches around the corner It nearly hits
PETER who leaps to avoid it

EXT BRICK BUILDING - NIGHT

PETERS cheek is pressed against the brick He opens his
eyes and sees that hes hanging onto the side of the
building like a spider And hes three stories up

He looks down and sees the street thirty feet below him
And the Ambulance which he jumped over is driving away
He tries a downward step but a BRICK dislodges and
crashes to the sidewalk He takes an upward step And
then another

Tentatively at first and then with growing confidence he
crawls to the roof of the building At the top he

gropes for a RAILING and slips He dangles eight stories
above the street Then with a grunt he vaults to the
roof one-handed

EXT THE ROOF - NIGHT

PETER is flat on his back staring at the stars He sits
up and looks wonderingly at his hands

On the back of his right hand are TWO PUNCTURE WOUNDS
surrounded by a faint BLUE-WHITE PULSING GLOW The GLOW
disappears
PETER
(mutters to himself)
This is weird My God I feel so weird

He leaps to his feet He flexes Feels weird Good
Weird In fact great weird He tries a couple of
jumping jacks and on the third jump he soars into the
air

PETER
(exhilarated)
Very weird

The great bespangled NEW YORK CITY is his backdrop as
PETER jumps and turns and does loops in the air

With the agility and tactility of a spider PETER leaps
from the RAILING to a WALL to a FLAG POLE to another WALL
where he lands sideways and sticks

PETER
(sideways)
Very very weird

He leaps off the WALL and lands at the edge of the roof
He looks down No ones looking back So he takes a
step back and leaps the alley to the next roof

EXT ROOFTOP SHACK - NIGHT

PETER lands on it The next roof is seven stories up and
across the street PETER bites his lip

PETER
Well what the hell

EXT THE TALLER BUILDING - NIGHT

Backlit by a FULL MOON PETER somersaults to the roof of
the taller building and misses the top

He sticks to the brick FACADE upside down He laughs
with the moment A WINDOW opens below him and a pretty
BLONDE in a TOWEL sticks her head out She looks this way
and that and all she sees is a MAN in a LOUD SPORTCOAT
down the street Never thinking to look up she withdraws
into the room

EXT CHELSEA STREET - NIGHT
The MAN in the LOUD SPORTCOAT leans against a LAMP POST

and lights a CIGARETTE with a BEAT UP SILVER PLATED
LIGHTER
In the LIGHTER he sees a reflection of PETER leaping off
the taller building He snaps around and looks up in time
to see PETER make it to the next FACADE

EXT ROOFTOP MONTAGE - NIGHT

With the UPTOWN SKYLINE behind him PETER casts caution to
the wind and leaps from rooftop to rooftop

Watching from the street the MAN in the LOUD SPORTCOAT
follows PETERS progress

PETER leaps to a BROWNSTONE and lands amid the WASH
He leaps up to a TENEMENT and lands on a BILLBOARD across
which he does a bug crawl and leaps again

He touches down on a PIGEON COOP and bounds up and out of
frame again The COOP OWNER a LATINO in an undershirt
and a YANKEES CAP comes running out of the COOP

Hes so surprised that he leaves the DOOR open and twenty
WHITE MORNING DOVES fly away in a furious flapping free
at last The LATINO lets out a stream of Hispanic
expletives complete with all the appropriately obscene
gestures

PETER slides down a CABLE to a LAMP POST and swirls down
the POLE to a PHONE BOOTH

EXT PHONE BOOTH - NIGHT

SPORTCOAT He gives PETER his CARD

(to himself)
Okay now Spidey Easy does it

He shoots a WEB about halfway up the PIT It hits the

OCK way up at the opening above raises a huge DRUM above
his head The DRUM leaks toxic waste in ORANGE TENDRILS
He is about to drop it down on SPIDER-MAN

him LIZ screams and tries to help FLASH

LIZ
Leave him alone

Another WALDO grabs her
ROZ now appears on the scene

ROZ
Leave them alone Otto

OCK
But they wont help me Everybody is

SPIDER-MAN
Dont listen to him Professor Roz

OCK
No you dont listen to that clown he
cant save you or the world for that
matter

A WALDO reaches in and rips ROZ off SPIDEY flinging him
back against a WALL ROZ lands in a heap beneath a FIRE
STATION (HOSE EXTINGUISHER AXE)

We see the WALDO reach out for SPIDER-MAN It wraps
around his FOOT and begins to tug slowly

OCK
Once and for all Spider-Man once and
for all well end the legend of your

powers

OCK knocks SPIDER-MAN with a real BIG BLOW with his WALDO
OCK is slowly dragging SPIDER-MAN to a HUGE HOLE thats
been ripped in the floor by the BEAMS of ELECTRICITY

We see New York a half a mile down through the hole We
see SPIDEY being drawn across the HOLE Then ROZ comes
flying in with the FIRE AXE

ROZ hacks away at the WALDO and chops it off The stump
withdraws OCK examines it in pain and fury

OCK
(ultimate betrayal)
You You were my teacher

ROZ doesnt even look back He and SPIDEY are at the edge
of the HOLE and hes shaking SPIDEY furiously

OCK sends out his other WALDO and begins banging it on the
floor in a frenzy on either side of ROZ and SPIDEY Like

a child denied he smashes his steel fists against the
floor again and again

OCK
You were my teacher And you want to
destroy my experiment You are a
scientist for heaven sake dont you
want to know whats up there

ROZ
Yes but not on account of our world We
have only one world only one life
The floor begins to craze and then crack like ice around

hole on a pond BANG BANG SPIDEY comes to just as the
section of floor beneath himself and ROZ gives way and
falls through

SPIDEY grabs hold of the edge and dangles He looks down
and sees ROZ falling away beneath him disappearing into
the dark

against his GLASSES SPIDEY scrambles to his feet OCK
still trying to get the WEB GOO off his GLASSES is
slammed into the CONSOLE by SPIDER-MAN SPARKS fly and
WALDOS flail blindly smashing things OCK tears off his
GLASSES and squints through the FIRE and SMOKE and GLARE
SPIDER-MAN THWIPS the ceiling and swings into a drop kick
OCK recovers He grabs SPIDEY and slam dunks him through
the hole in the floor

EXT THE BOTTOM OF THE BUILDING - NIGHT
SPIDER-MAN falls through the air He shoots up a WEB and
THWIPS it sticks to the ROCKY bottom of the FOUNDATION
OCK appears in the HOLE He sees SPIDEYS dilemma
hanging on a thread of WEB A half-broken WALDO snakes
down and CLIPS the WEB

But the WEB sticks to the WALDO OCK shakes it but he
cant get loose SPIDER-MAN shoots out another WEB at the
ROCK BOTTOM and with the leverage he pulls OCK out

OCK swings down in a wide arc and his WALDOS catch on the
ROCK upside down He holds on fiercely

OCK scrambles out to the side of the CENTER and begins
looking for an entry SPIDER-MAN is right on his tail
The building pitches sideways OCK turns to face SPIDER-
MAN his broken WALDOS out for BATTLE

SPIDEY grabs an EXPOSED PIPE and breaks it off
brandishing it like a broad sword

SPIDER-MAN
Lets have it old boy

A bizarre DUEL takes place The CENTER pitches this way
and that SPIDEY and OCK move from foothold to foothold

from WINDOW to LEDGE to PARAPET

Now the CENTER pitches to a 45 degree angle They DUEL
upside down A WINDOW GRATE crashes open and LIZ comes
flying out holding onto the GRATE for dear life

SPIDER-MAN
Liz

OCK seizes the opportunity to whack SPIDEY across the

head SPIDEY loses his footing but the building now
lurches back and LIZ goes flying back inside SPIDEY
ducks inside too and pulls the GRATE

SPIDER-MAN uses his great strength to move a HUGE PIECE of
SCIENTIFIC MACHINERY in front of the GRATE

cables Try those over there Ill work
on these We gotta slow this thing down

Pull

She yanks out a CABLE The building pitches But when

continue to pull WIRES and CABLES TWO WALDOS erupt
through the floor and grab SPIDEY They pull SPIDEY to
the floor Entangled in these molybdimum pythons SPIDEY
struggles valiantly LIZ leaps to his aid

LIZ
Oh my God

A third WALDO a broken one snakes up from the HOLE and
begins feeling blindly around on the CONSOLE for the POWER
THROTTLE

SPIDER-MAN
The power

LIZ sees the damaged WALDOS heading for the RED THROTTLE
The COUNTDOWN CLOCK is at 000010 LIZ leaps and tries
to wrestle it away It whips in her arms and she holds on
tight It bangs her against the wall and then the
CONSOLE She holds on 000003 The WALDO crashes

LIZ against the wall which erupts in SPARKS She lets go
of it It heads for the POWER THROTTLE 000001
SPIDER-MAN cant break the grip of the WALDOS but he can
pull with super-human strength He yanks OCK up through
the STONE floor OCK hits the ceiling of the CONTROL
ROOM ONE WALDO grabs on The other one throws the RED
POWER THROTTLE

OCK
Spider-Man Youre end is coming Life
in its present form is ending new

dimensions new horizons

The UNIVERSAL BULLET begins to GLOW The GLOW sharpens to
a POINT of LIGHT SPIDER-MAN holds on tight against a
rushing ENERGY FLOW thats pulling everything in the room
towards the POINT of LIGHT

LIZ
(bracing against the storm)
What is happening

SPIDER-MAN
(similarly braced)
I dont know

LIZ starts to slip away into the flow She struggles
against it

LIZ
I cant hold on

SPIDEY THWIPS her and she grabs onto the WEB

SPIDER-MAN
Hold tight Liz hold tight

OCK drops calmly beatifically to the floor of the room
He moves slowly under his own power into the LIGHT

OCK
(spaced out)

You cut my power theres too little
power Its so tiny so tiny
theres only space for me But Ive
done it Spider-Man I have broken
through Ive broken through

LIZ

Dont do it Dr Octavius

OCK
Okey dokey Now thats what I call
an experiment

As he nears the LIGHT he actually becomes a part of it
He radiates LIGHT He shimmers and shines He fills the
room with BLINDING LIGHT

SPIDEY and LIZ shield their eyes and as the light
diminishes the storm subsides Theyre safe Except for
the fact that theyre in a floating building 10000 feet
above the city

bursting SPIDEY helps LIZ through the obstacles Debris
rains down They come face to face with a diagonal maze

of PIPES
SPIDER-MAN
Maybe theres another way

A HUGE CRACK opens above them

LIZ
Its breaking apart

Alright keep moving a step at a time

They scale the maze but as they emerge on the other side
half the floor falls away Central Park awaits 8000
feet below

LIZ
We have to go back

SPIDER-MAN
We cant go back

He looks across at the door It is midway up a diagonal
wall He shoots a WEB up at the ceiling between
themselves and the door Then he extends a hand to LIZ

LIZ
Forget it

SPIDER-MAN
Okay have it your way

He swings across and lands on the LEDGE of the DOOR Then
he swings the WEB back to her like a trapeze

LIZ catches the WEB and looks across at SPIDER-MAN
furious

LIZ
(shouting across)
What am I supposed to do with this

SPIDER-MAN
(shouting back)
Go ahead Its easier than it looks
Weve got to try the fire escape

LIZ swings across like TARZAN and SPIDEY gathers her in on
the LEDGE She does a comic phew and the LEDGE buckles
beneath them but holds SPIDER-MAN tries to open the

door but its stuck

LIZ
The door is stuck

SPIDER-MAN bends his back to the task It take all his
strength but with a comic AAAAARGGHH He bends the DOOR
open

pulls on it with all her strength She pulls and pulls
and pulls We see the WEB running up between the ROCKS
She gives one last pull and comes up with an EMPTY WEB
