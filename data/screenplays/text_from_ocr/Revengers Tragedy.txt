1 ExtDeserted Street Day

Pan from a sign saying LIVERPOOL - DRIVE WITH CARE
to a bus shot full of bullet holes The driver is dead
The bus rolls into a burned-out car and stops

2 Int Bus Day

Dead bodies Flies buzz around A mobile rings
VINDICI appears from under the pile of corpses
The only survivor of the massacre

2AExt Deserted Street Day

VINDICI kicks the emergency door out and jumps into the street
He carries a kit bag

He looks around inhales He has landed

3 Ext Warehouses Day

VINDICI walks up a narrowroad behind a vast ancient tobacco
warehouse The walls on either side are windowless and huge
It’s as though he is walking down a brick valley

Suddenly a young thug small in stature appears in the road
in front of him He is a little spitting FIREWORK of anger
His words fly out like mad sparks

FIREWORK
Hey cockney Are you a cockney
You cockney bastard Are you lost cockney

VINDICI raises an eyebrow This is not a conversation he feels
drawn to

FIREWORK
Hey cockney I said are you lost

VINDICI
Shush

VINDICI tries to walk on by but the FIREWORK walks backwards in
front of him keeping a distance and taunting him while other
much bigger THUGS appear from all sides The FIREWORK grins
triumphantly He has led VINDICI into a trap

FIREWORK feints makes as if to hit VINDICI At the same
moment one of the big THUGS makes a grab for him

Before either he or the audience sees what is happening
FIRKEWORK is flattened against a poster of the DUKE The big
THUG’s arm is broken The biggest THUG of all makes a rush at
VINDICI and is immediately flattened
There is a sickening sound of bones snapping as VINDICI breaks
another thug’s leg Another THUG dives in and is equally
devastated The other TWO THUGS run away

Throughout it all VINDICI is as impassive and uninvolved as if
he were driving a tractor

FIVE THUGS now lie groaning on the ground The FIREWORK is
screaming with pain VINDICI looks almost pityingly at him
He makes a move towards him but FIREWORK shuffles backwards
screaming some more

VINDICI
I am not lost I’m home

VINDICI looks up at the huge poster of the DUKE and ARTHUR
ASKEY He stares at it balefully while dusting himself off

He walks with sudden purpose and resolution

A4 Ext Catacombs Day

The entrance to a long dark tunnel Two people going in and
out It’s a public place VINDICI walks purposefully past the
GUARD into the tunnel He stoops to pick a single flower

4 Int Catacombs Day

We go with VINDICI into the tunnel It is lit by a low level
phosphorescent glow There are niches and shelves all along
its length and people - mostly OLD WOMEN - looking into these
niches

As we get closer we see that the niches are stacked with neat
piles of human bones sometimes tied with ribbon or topped off
with a photograph or religious card

The tunnel is actually a catacomb The OLD WOMEN are attending
the remains of their loved ones Some of them are putting
flowers on the shelves others little bowls of rice or sweets

VINDICI walks past them He’s looking for some remains of his
own He comes to a neat pile of bones tied with ribbon with
the SKULL balanced on top The SKULL still has a full head of
glorious red hair tied up in a pig tail

VINDICI picks it off the pile of bones and undoes the pigtail
slowly letting the red tresses fall around the SKULL as he

speaks

VINDICI
Thou sallow remnant of my poisoned love
My study’s ornament thou shell of death
Once the bright face of my betrothéd lady
Now the hair is down He holds the SKULL up so that light -
catches the eye sockets The SKULL (and its fabulous hair)
seems to fill the screen

VINDICI
When life and beauty naturally fill’d out
These ragged imperfections
When two heaven-pointed diamonds were set
In those unsightly rings --

From the SKULL we

cut TO --

The living face of the SKULL’s owner GLORIANA It’s a face
flushed with life - ruddy happy glowing

VINDICI
-- then ‘twas a face
So far beyond the artificial shine
Of any woman’s bought complexion

As we pull back from the perfect face we find that we are ina

FLASHBACK

4F Int Marquee Day

GLORIANA is dancing She’w wearing a wedding dress
We are inside a marquee set out for the wedding reception of
VINDICI and GLORIANA

VINDICI - younger and without his scars - is dancing with her

We’re witnessing VINDICI’s most idyllic most cherished memory
The music light and ambiance are clearly very idealised

PICK UP ON

GLORIANA throwing the wedding bouquet over her shoulder

A bunch of BRIDESMAIDS and FEMALE GUESTS line up to catch it
A little girl in a bridesmaid’s outfit dives and catches it
This is the young CASTIZA

Laughing that one so young has cought the bouquet GLORIANA
catches the child up in her arms and hoists her into the air
VINDICI comes alongside and they both give CASTIZA a chariot

PICK UP ON

an OLDER MAN distributing glasses of champagne One goes to
GLORIANA another to VINDICI CASTIZA is still standing
between them both when they raise their glasses in a toast

As GLORIANA raises the glass to her lips we go in on the face
and a gasp of horror intrudes into this memory from the
‘present’
VINDICI vO
No

4A The image of the lovely face with its halo of red hair
is suddenly replaced by the image of the SKULL On the SKULL

we hear -

VINDICI
She when she was dressed in flesh
The old Duke poison’d
Because that she would not consent
Unto his lust

The SKULL too is still horribly draped with the same red
curly hair and we are back in the --

4BInt Catacombs Day

VINDICI looks up from his reverie and sees that some of the
OLD WOMEN are staring at him

VINDICI points the SKULL at them and uses it as a
ventriloquist’s dummy throwing his voice into it and waggling
it about to make it look as though they’re talking

VINDICISKULL
It’s true Old bones don’t lie

VINDICI
They lie in the grave

VINDICISKULL
When ‘they are at peace they do
But these old bones will have no peace
until they have - Revenge

6 Ext Anfield - Streets and Ground Evening

All the lights are on but there is no one around Just A
HANDFUL OF PROTESTORS on one side of the Shankly Gates and
several SECURITY GUARDS with stun weapons on the other

PICK UP ON A BIG LIMO

working its way down the road It is followed by OUTRIDERS -
two big lads on scooters
1 Int Limo Evening

In the back of the limo are the five TOURNEUR brothers

These are LUSSURIOSO (the eldest and most powerful) JUNIOR
(the youngest legitimate son a fool) AMBITIOSO SUPERVACUO
and SPURIO his mother’s favourite There is not really enough
room for all of them on the back seat They try to look cool
but they keep pushing and elbowing each other trying to get
comfortable

LUSSURIOSO tries to sit right back in the seat but this
dislodges SUPERVACUO and he tries to snuggle back into his
space There’s a lot of grunting and under the breath
complaining but no one will say anything direct about it

8 Ext Football Ground Evening

The TOURNEUR brothers’ limo slides through the gates the few
PROTESTORS held back by the GUARDS

One GUARD closes the gate behind the LIMO He wears a puffa
jacket and key chain and his name is CARLO

The TOURNEURS have trouble getting out of the car with dignity

The younger brothers race over to an athletic-looking man
maybe a fighter This is their BOY They are pleased to see
him and give a big cheer

LUSSURIOSO is the last out He seems familiar with CARLO
The PROTESTORS boo him

LUSSURIOSO
Men come stand either side the peace and
safety of our state which is my person
Or will be when my Father’s dead

The brothers all group around LUSSURIOSO except for AMBITIOSO
who leads their BOY into the ground quietly giving him some
kind of sporting motivational talk

The DRIVER has just got out of the limo She throws LUSSURIOSO
the key of the car which he passes to CARLO with a grin

The DRIVER follows the brothers in through the entrance to the
stand Only LUSSURIOSO his BODYGUARDS and CARLO remain
LUSSURIOSO is twitchy and furtive

LUSSURIOSO
Carlo d’you know a fellow

‘CARLO
What fellow

LUSSURIOSO
Any fellow
CARLO
I know thee

LUSSURIOSO
Any fellow so he be a strange disgested
fellow of ill-contented nature as it might
be disgraced in former times a pimp

CARLO
A pimp

LUSSURIOSO
I need a man can help me in the business
of my heart Will you think on’t

He gives CARLO a patronising slap on the shoulder then follows
his brothers inside

(OMIT SC 9)

Football Pitc F

AMBITIOSO TOURNEUR is in the dug out with his BOY The BOY
looks edgy and nervous He holds his hands out to AMBITIOSO who
massages them for him then tells him to shake his hands The
two stand opposite each other shaking their hands - loosening

their wrists

Behind them some pre-match entertainment is under way
a knife-throwing act - on the centre spot

There’s a huge video’screen at the other end of the ground
which monitors the act The ‘target’ of the act is a girl in
her late teensearly twenties She’s very pretty and has an
aura of real innocence about her

Her name is CASTIZA

The guy throwing the knives is called HIPPOLITO
It’s a corny comic act

11 ive F Eveni

The other brothers are watching the act which also shows on a
video screen in their suite They love it when the knives just
miss CASTIZA LUSSURIOSO seems slightly more concerned about
the possibility that the knives will hit her than the others

There’s a sudden cheer from outside

LUSSURIOSO
What’s that

SUPERVACUO
Lord Antonio
JUNIOR
And his lady

11B On the video monitors the image of a benign
distinguished middle aged man and his fragrant wife

The man wears municipal-looking chains of office He looks
powerful but with a common touch

These are LORD ANTONIO and IMOGEN They wave to the small
crowd outside the gate Cameras flash and good wishes are
called With them is a young LAD in sports gear - who also
gets a cheer - and his TRAINER

The BROTHERS watch as ANTONIO and IMOGEN take their places in
the statium They don’t like this guy The camera settles on
IMOGEN She’s very beautiful

JUNIOR
That’s the one That one is mine

SUPERVACUO
That virtuous lady Fool

lic Ext Pitch Evening
The knife act is over and the target is being removed

The BOY nervously watches as the LAD goes through his warm up
in the other dug out Suddenly big music plays on the speakers
and the giant video monitors show the portrait photographs of
the DUKE and Arthur Askey

The BOY and the LAD walk onto the pitch led out by a REFEREE
BOY and LAD both look nervous

CUT AWAY TO

The SECURITY GUYS watching from the stand They are all yelling
and arguing with each other Huge wads of money are being
exchanged and laid down

11nInt Bar Night
A similar scene MEN grouped around a TV are watching the LAD

and the BOY walk onto the pitch while arguing and placing huge
bets with each other

LIEExt Pitch Night

The LAD BOY and REF are now at the centre spot where there is
a large cubic object draped in a gold cloth
The REF steps forward and removes the cloth - revealing a
BAR FOOTBALL TABLE LAD and BOY take up positions on either
side of it

hers iat

The BOYS are watching the build up to the match Now the cloth
has been removed no more bets

LUSSURIOSO
No more bets No more bets No more

2 13 sat

CARLO is outside his little portakabin He looks up as
CASTIZA the girl from the knife act approaches

CASTIZA pulls a gun and points it at him He looks momentarily
alarmed She trains the gun on his head pulls the trigger but
it produces only a little flag with the word Bang written on
it CARLO fakes a head wound and she hugs him better They
laugh

She is in fact his sister He hands her a styrofoam cup of
hot chocolate

CARLO
Those cheers

CASTIZA
Antonio

This is said with raised eyebrows as if the cheers were highly
significant

CARLO
The game

CASTIZA
The teams yet stand upon the Duke’s arrival

LAD and BOY stand opposite each other on either side of the
table silent motionless bored-looking in the empty stadium

13AInt Bar Night
The same image - the bored teams in the empty stadium - relayed
by TV to the crowded bar

Suddenly someone at the back starts to sing “Why are we
waiting and the chant is taken up
1 ‘at

CASTIZA is finishing her hot chocolate Suddenly there is a
noise at the gate and CARLO’s walkie talkie crackles into life

CARLO
The Duke

Time to work But before he goes he directs CASTIZA back to
the portakabin

CARLO
Go sister hide your pretty face
Beware an old man hot and vicious
“Age as in gold in lust is covetous

CASTIZA
That he could do such wicked deeds and yet

be Duke -

She goes into the portakabin and shuts the door

PICK UP ON CARLO

Opening the gates A big Mercedes slides in to the yells of
the PROTESTORS

The DUKE and DUCHESS emerge from the car He is a powerful
crime chieftan in middle age He has real gravitas and an aura
of casual menace He is genuinely not bothered by the

protests

The DUCHESS is of similar age and personal authority to her
husband This is a marriage of equals - each knows where the
other one’s bodies are buried They head for their BOX

The DUKE walks in powerful big cat slo mo pausing for flash
photographs ‘

As the PROTESTORS shout Why are we waiting one of them
manages to step inside the gate It’s VINDICI

VINDICI
Go royal lecher go grayhair’d adultery
And thou his Duchess Oh that God
Would stuff infernal fire into your brittle

veins

This nutty outburst silences the other PROTESTORS and catches
the attention of CARLO who comes running up to challenge him

CARLO
Do I know you friend

VINDICI
Do you know me more than friend

CARLO frowns and stares at him a while It’s quite tense

Then suddenly he throws his arms around VINDICI and hugs him
enthusiastically

CARLO
Brother you are home

As CARLO embraces him VINDICI stares at the stadium

15 Int Duke’s Box Football Ground Night

The DUKE and DUCHESS take their place in their directors’ box
Their movements are relayed to all the TV viewers and via the
giant video screen

The DUKE sits down to RECORDED APPLAUSE

He gives a signal to the watching REFEREE The whistle blows
The game begins

15AA Int Football Ground Night

LAD and BOY are locked inmortal combat across the bar footie
table Their concentration is intense sweaty foccused The
stacatto percussion of the hard ball rattling in the narrow
confines of the wooden table has a nervous brain scratching
quality It sounds like a giant cockroach

Suddenly the LAD slams home a goal and both stand back for a
second The REFEREE drops another ball onto the table and

they’re off again

15AInt Bar Night

Same event - LAD and BOY playing intense bar footie their
heads leaning closer and closer together across the table

PULL BACK to the bar The BOY scores another and the bar crowd
starts to boo and hiss

16 Ext Stadium Car Park Evening

CARLO is locking the gate and shining his torch into various
dark corners doing his rounds VINDICI eyes the stadium

VINDICI
The Duke yet prospers

CARLO
Since her funeral -

He hesitates can’t complete the sentence VINDICI does it
li

VINDICI
My life’s unnatural to me
As if I liv’d now when I should be dead
Yet murder will not go unpaid Be merry
For Vengeance that terror to fat folks
hath bussed in with me Brother you must
needs find me a place at court I must
be near the Duke

CARLO stares at his brother amazed

CARLO
This is strange
This very e’en the Duke’s first born and heir
- Lussurioso - asked me find out for him a
strange-composed and ill-digested fellow

VINDICI
This e’en you say Why brother this is Fate

CARLO
It is But whose His Fate or yours

CARLO is genuinely unsettled by this

VINDICI
I set my Fate at naught so that I have

Revenge

17Int Football Ground Night

The LAD scores again Recorded cheers of an invisible crowd

PICK UP ON THE DUKE and his SONS watching the game We can see
from their reaction that the game is not going their way

17 An image of ANTONIO flashes onto the giant video
monitors He looks very pleased with himself His WIFE gives
him a kiss on the cheek then she gets up and works her way to
the exit She must be going to the loo

AMBITIOSO enters the brothers’ box They all turn on him

LUSSURIOSO
Your boy disgraces us-

AMBITIOSO
He’s a good boy

SUPERVACUO
He has two left wrists

Through this row JUNIOR never takes his eyes off the video
While everyone else is watching the bar football he is
watching IMOGEN When he sees that she has left the safety of
her box he sneaks out of his own family’s box From the
speakers come chants of ‘Tonio’ ‘Tonio’

18 Int Football - Corridors Evening
Track JUNIOR out into the long utterly empty corridors that
run around the stadium beneath the stands He walks quickly

he is looking for someone He checks his watch Above his
head the recorded crowd roars as another goal is scored

IMOGEN is walking searching for something in her handbag

She looks up and sees a figure lounging on the wall ahead of
her It is JUNIOR

She slows down He stands up He starts towards her She
makes as if to step forward but then turns suddenly on her heel

and heads back towards her box He hurries after her She
breaks into a run He chases her

He gets ahead of her blocking her way

IMOGEN
Leave me sirrah

JUNIOR
I have no like to

She pulls away and hits a fire door hurrying through it

The moment the door is opened an alarm goes off He curses
and then hastens after her

18AInt Bar Night

The CROWD goes wild as ANTONIO’s “team scores

JUNIOR pursues IMOGEN down the fire escape

19a Int Bar Evening
Riotous celebrations

CROWD
Tonio Tonio Tonio

20 Int Tourneur Brothers’ Executive Box Night

The alarm is ringing even louder in here There is
consternation among the members of the family
LUSSURIOSO is particularly agitated

LUSSURIOSO
Men My person Stand by my person

As his GUARDS stand on either side of him he says quietly
but excitedly -

LUSSURIOSO
It may be that some assassin threats the Duke
my Father’s head In which case you know
the Dukedom will want a head Which must be
mine

21 Ext Car Park Night

CARLO and VINDICI lookround for some sign of the cause of the
alarm

Big close up of the ALARM screeching

IMOGEN emerges from the fire escape her clothes disordered and
she’s screaming and cursing

CASTIZA runs to IMOGEN from the Portakabin The door of the
fire escape creaks open a second time and JUNIOR swaggers out
adjusting his clothing Seeing CASTIZA he grins

JUNIOR
What’s this a sweet for when I’ve eaten

up my meat

He turns his attention back to IMOGEN CASTIZA pulls her away
VINDICI grabs JUNIOR by the shoulders floors him starts to
kick him

CARLO
Go now Here’s danger

CASTIZA
This lady has need of me

CASTIZA takes off her jacket and offers it to IMOGEN IMOGEN
puts it on with dignity but once she’s covered she starts to
ery CASTIZA walks her away

VINDICI is still kicking JUNIOR CARLO whispers to his
brother

CARLO
This is the Duke’s son

VINDICI
Another blow then for his Father’s sake

CARLO
Our plan’s dependent on his family’s trust

Uniformed GUARDS appear and drag away JUNIOR

LUSSURIOSO appears and goes to CARLO VINDICI is trying to
calm down nearby

LUSSURIOSO
He did assault my brother

CARLO
My lord he is newly come to the port
he knows not

VINDICI
Aye I assaulted him and would have killed
him too I was prevented

CARLO holds his breath and looks to LUSSURIOSO for an answer
LUSSURIOSO takes his time to think then says to CARLO

LUSSURIOSO
I like him

22 Ext Fire Escape Night

There’s chaos now A police helicopter hovers over the scene
COPS are putting JUNIOR into the back of a van The DUKE is
watching IMOGEN is next to him crying

We are watching this from the POV of LUSSURIOSO and VINDICI

LUSSURIOSO
What hast been Of what profession

VINDICI
A bonesetter

LUSSURIOSO
A bone-setter

VINDICI
A bawd my sweet musk cat
One that sets bones together

LUSSURIOSO
Wondrous knave Familiar as an ague
Friend I can
Forget myself in private but elsewhere
I pray do you remember me
I am not Duke yet but will be by and by
Thou hast been an agent to much knavery then

VINDICT
I have been witness
To the surrenders of a thousand virgins
I have seen patrimonies wash’d a’ pieces

LUSSURIOSO
Then thou know’st i’ th’ world strange lust

VINDICI
Oh fulsome lust
grunken procreation which begets
fo many drunkards Some father dreads not
gone to bed in wine - (CONT )

VINCICI (CONT)
-- to slide from the mother
And cling the daughter-in-law

Some uncles are adulterous with their nieces

Brothers with brothers’ wives
incest

Oh hour of

Any kin now next to the rim a’ th’ sister
Is man’s meat in these days and in the

morning

When they are up and dress‘d and their

mask on

Who can perceive this save that eternal eye
That sees through flesh and all

228 As VINDICI speaks we dissolve to a MONTAGE of LIVERPOOL

SATURDAY NIGHT STREETLIFE -- the same as it’s been for the
last twenty years - but with weirder sexier costumes and more
tattoos and piercings with pockets of rebels carrying shields
and masks -- shot in all possible MEDIA --

LUSSURIOSO

It is our blood to err tho’ hell gap’d loud
Ladies know Lucifer fell yet still are proud

The MONTAGE ends LUSSURIOSO buttonholes VINDICI

LUSSURIOSO

Now sir I am past my depth in lust
And I must swim or drown all my desires
Are level’d at a virgin not far from Hamilton

Square

To whom I have convey’d by messenger

Many wax’d lines full of my neatest spirit
And jewels that were able to ravish her
Without the help of man all which and more
She foolish-chaste sent back

VINDICI
Possible

‘Tis a rare phoenix whoe’er she be
If your desires be such she so resistant
In troth my lord I’d be reveng’d and marry

her

LUSSURIOSO

Push the dowry of her blood and of her

fortunes

Are both too mean good enough to be bad

withal

Good enough to provoke any badness

Poor enough to be a fit target for my Lust
I’m one of that number can defend

Marriage is good yet rather keep a friend

‘VINDICI
A very fine religion

LUSSURIOSO
I’ll trust thee in the business of my heart
Because I see thee well experienc’d

Below the police cars have pulled out and the DUKE and his
entourage are leaving

VINDICI
You have gi’n ’t the tang i’faith my lord
Make known the lady to me and my brain
Shall swell with strange invention I will
move it
Till I expire with speaking

LUSSURIOSO
We thank thee and now receive her name
It is Castiza Look down there that’s her

He points to -- 22B - CASTIZA now standing down below with
IMOGEN More or less everyone else has gone

VINDICI
Oh my sister my sister

LUSSURIOSO
Dost know her then

VINDICI
By sight only

LUSSURIOSO
That was her brother
That did prefer thee to us

VINDICI
I knew I had seen him somewhere
LUSSURIOSO
We may laugh at that he is young and easy
guiled
VINDICI
Ha ha ha
LUSSURIOSO

Himself being made the subtle instrument
To entice and work his own sister

VINDICI
‘twas finely managd
23 Int James St Station Night

CASTIZA and HIPPOLITO are walking into the station
LUSSURIOSO continues in VO

LUSSURIOSO (VO)
Go thou and with a smooth enchanting tongue
Bewitch her ears and cheat her of all grace
Enter upon her chastity -

24 Int Lussurioso’s Pad Night

LUSSURIOSO is explaining his plan to VINDICI
They’re drinking whiskey

LUSSURIOSO opens a drawer in his desk It’s brimming with
jewels watches bracelets etc He picks one out

LUSSURIOSO
Give it her thus and say she must expect
an invoice for my love

VINDICI is trying on a jacket helped by LUSSURIOSO’S TWO
GIRLFRIENDS

ui orai ict

CASTIZA in a crowded compartment She’s hot and tired and
hassled

VINDICI (VO)
How if money will not tempt her from her

virtue

1s Pad igh
LUSSURIOSO and VINDICI plot over the bar football table

LUSSURIOSO
Then venture upon the mother and with gifts
As I will furnish thee begin with her

VINDICI
Oh fie that’s wrong my lord ‘Tis mere
impossible that a
Mother by any gifts should become a Madam

to her own daughter

v1 Ext Four Bridges Night

CASTIZA arrives home In the shadow of a rusting dry-docked
SUBMARINE she enters the outskirts of a corrugated metal
-SHANTY TOWN This is home

Over her arrival --

LUSSURIOSO (VO)
Nay then I see thou’rt but a puny in the
subtle mystery of a woman (CONT) —

LUSSURIOSO VO (CONT)
Why the name of Madam
Is so in league with age that nowadays
It does eclipse three quarters of a mother

28 Int Lussurioso’s Pad Night
LUSSURIOSO and VINDICI still plotting

LUSSURIOSO
Now then swear to be true in all

VINDICI
Swear
I hope your honour little doubts my faith

LUSSURIOSO
Yet for my humour’s sake ‘cause I love
swearing

VINDICI
‘Cause you love swearing ‘slud I will

29 IntHannah’s Night

HANNAH is combing out CASTIZA’s hair
They’re in the middle of an animated conversation

The décor of the interior is strange and shows signs of
obsessional behaviour There are small voodoo-ish statues of
bizarre South American saints circus equipment and a large
collection of wigs Or possibly scalps

HANNAH
But he is a rich man —

CASTIZA
Rich is not the same as virtuous

HANNAH
Then have two men One rich and one virtuous
Oh daughter I know he smiled at thee
He the Duke’s son

CASTIZA
He smiled and my angel guardian wept
HANNAH
Maids and their honours are like poor
beginners
CASTIZA
Were not sin rich there would be fewer
sinners

Both laugh at CASTIZA’s fortuitous rhyme

HANNAH
Oh why had not virtue a revenue
CASTIZA
I know the cause ‘’twould have impoverish’d

Hell

Both laugh again

30 ExtFour Bridges Night

We are watching this from the POV of VINDICI who is
standing outside He’s cold The house looks warm and
inviting The women inside seem light-hearted and happy
The lower-level light goes off

He pulls his coat around him to keep warm

Something happens in an upstairs window --

31 Int Hannah’s Night

The blind HANNAH pauses by a windowsill and passes her hand
over an unlit candle there She is trying to discover whether
it is lit or not It’s not

She locates a box of matches takes out a match and feels for
which end has the phosphorous on it

CASTIZA comes and takes it from her
HANNAH
(of the CANDLE) For your brother
And for all poor souls at sea

CASTIZA stays looking at candle

FLASHBACK TO -

31F Int Marquee Day

We’re back at the wedding reception looking into the smiling
face of VINDICI -- from the POV of the young CASTIZA who is
sitting in the ‘chariot’ made by the arms of VINDICI and

GLORIANA
PICK UP ON THE WEDDING CAKE

It has a little plastic couple on the top Thebride has
flaming red hair like GLORIANA

The CLOAKED MAN offers first GLORIANA and then VINDICI
champagne

GLORIANA puts CASTIZA down When VINDICI takes his champagne
his sister reaches for it He hoists it out of her reach

HANNAH frowns a ‘no’ at CASTIZA
PICK UP ON GLORIANA AND VINDICI

with their glasses raised high for a toast
GLORIANA drinks hers off

VINDICI goes to do the same but surruptitiously hands his to
his little sister CASTIZA

Suddenly a terrible thing happens GLORIANA keels over the
glass falling from her hand and shattering on the floor She
is screaming and - horribly - spitting blood Others too are
screaming and spitting

OTHER PEOPLE scream and try to spit out the wine

VINDICI’s first act is to spin around and knock the wine glass
from his siters’s hands Then he goes to help GLORIANA

CASTIZA is stunned All around her people are falling over
clutching their stomachs spitting and retching

She looks up and sees the mysterious FIGURE we saw earlier

summoning his WAITERS They move in thuggish and efficient
and begin to loot the guests of their jewelry bags and so on

(OMIT SCS 32 32a)

A323 Int Castiza’s Bedroom Night

The CANDLE gutters out CASTIZA is lying in bed asleep
Something disturbs her She half wakes She’s alarmed

She looks in the drawer in her bedside table takes out one of
her THROWING KNIVES and slides out of bed

33IntHannah’s Night
CASTIZA approaches the kitchen

The Fridge door has inexplicably opened filling the room with
a low level dim light ‘

She goes to shut the fridge -- but suddenly a hand reaches out
from behind her The hand has a jewel in it

She jumps back but in doing so jumps almost into the arms of
her UNSEEN ASSAILANT

We can see now who the assailant is But CASTIZA is nervous
and relying on the flickering light of the Fridge She does
not recognise his face

CASTIZA
Who are you Is this my Mother’s jewel

Then give it back

She twists around and tries to stab her unseen assailant
Suddenly a very bright torch shines in her eyes She is
briefly dazzled her hand goes up to shield her eyes by
instinct The assailant takes the hand that holds the knife

UNSEEN
I came here not to steal But to give

This for you

CASTIZA
Whence comes it

UNSEEN
From a dear and mighty friend

CASTIZA
From whom

UNSEEN
The Duke’s son

CASTIZA
Receive that

She hits him and hisses at him

UNSEEN
Take care ma’m lest this should bite you

back
His torchlight picks up the glint of the knife

CASTIZA
I swore I’d put anger in my hand
And pass the virgin limits of myself
To him that next appear’d in that base office
To be the agent of his sin
fell him my honour shall have a rich name
When several harlots shall share his with

shame
Farewell commend me to him in my hate

She reaches out and takes the torch of her assailant
She points it into his face and frowns

CASTIZA
I know your face

VINDICI
I think not

CASTIZA
Yet I have seen it before

He does not respond She flashes the knife again
She is trying to solve a mystery

CASTIZA
Have I not

VINDICI
When last we met you stood not higher
than the altitude of a stack-heeled shoe
You knew me not then
You will not know me now

Her tone is starting to change to something more tender and
less confrontational

CASTIZA
Yet I do know you For something of
myself I do discern in thee

VINDICI
I have two legs and you have two and
Christ loves both of us alike I hope

Suddenly CASTIZA gasps

CASTIZA
I think - dare I think this - you
are my brother

VINDICI is amazed and very moved by her insight He touches
her

VINDICI
You are my sister and I am home

CASTIZA
And I welcomed you in with a slap

VINDICI
It is the sweetest slap
That e’er my nose came nigh
I’ll love this blow forever and this cheek
Shall still hence forward be my favourite

34 I C 2 a Kit I ° Ni I
CASTIA is making coffee for VINDICI

CASTIZA
It is not kind for kin to put each other

to the test

VINDICI
I was employed to do it But you were
constant and in this thou hast right
honorable shown Thou art approved
forever in my thoughts

CASTIZA
I knew my honour already without your test
It was not kind

There is a sound from upstairs

VINDICI
My Mother

CASTIZA nods VINDICI is discomposed

VINDICI
I must test her too
CASTIZA
What No
VINDICI

I am employed to do it
HANNAH enters She’s just tumbled out of bed

HANNAH
Castiza What a coil is here
(sensing VINDICI’s presence)
Who’s here

CASTIZA
Mother -

VINDICI
Our mighty expectation Lussurioso son of the
Duke commends himself to your affection
I am his servant and so yours

HANNAH
The Duke’s

She’s flustered and bewildered

VINDICI
His son’s who shall be Duke hereafter

HANNAH
Oh But just the same an honour sir
I’m much honour’d to find that he is pleased
fo rank me in his thoughts

CASTIZA
Mother - I think you know this man

VINDICI makes signs to her to say nothing

HANNAH
Hush child I’m beginning to know him
Go on sir

VINDICI
My Master will be Duke hereafter The crown
gapes for him every tide The old Duke’s days

are numbered
How bless’d were they now that could pleasure

Lussurioso
E’en with anything almost

HANNAH
Aye

CASTIZA
Save with their honour

HANNAH
Oh save with their honour clearly

VINDICI takes HANNAH’s hand and drops the JEWEL into it

VINDICI
As for honour one would let a little of that
go too
And ne’er be seen in’t I’d wink and let it go

CASTIZA
But we would not Is’t so Mama

HANNAH
Oh we would not Not ‘for - ruby

HANNAH is talking about the jewel in VINDICI’s hand
She has to sit down confused and troubled
CASTIZA whispers to her brother

CASTIZA
It is not well done To use her thus -

VINDICI

To keep my promise I must lay
Hard siege unto my mother What of’t
A siren’s tongue could not bewitch her
not in such a case Surely

(to HANNAH)
The old Duke’s days are numbered
After him my Master will be Duke
Now that same man my Master has long
desir’d your daughter

HANNAH
Desir’d

CASTIZA
What of’t Tis naught Not so Mama

VINDICI
Now he desires that will command hereafter
She’s flustered

HANNAH
That’s true He will command hereafter

VINDICI
Madam I know that y’are poor
And ‘lack the day there are too many poor
ladies already
Why should you vex the number ‘Tis despis’d
Live wealthy rightly understand the world
And chide away that foolish country girl
Keeps company with your daughter chastity

CASTIZA
Fie sir The riches of the world cannot hire
A mother to such a most unnatural task

VINDICI
Would a mother be poor dejected scorn’d
of greatness
Swept from the palace and see other daughters
Spring with the dew a’ th’ court having her own
So much desir’d and lov’d by the Duke’s son

HANNAH
Oh heavens

and clearly tempted

CASTIZA
Do not proceed

VINDICI
Madam ’tis no shame to be bad because
‘tis common

HANNAH
Ay that is a comfort

CASTIZA
A comfort

VINDICI
Can these persuade you
To forget heaven

He hands her a wad of banknotes bearing the DUKE’s face

CASTIZA
Mother in the name of Christ tell this man
you want none of his dishonorable act

VINDICI
‘Slid how can you lose your honour
To deal with my lord’s grace
He’1l add more honour to it by his title
Your mother will tell you how

HANNAH
That’s true He does speak well

CASTIZA is on the point of tears

CASTIZA
Stop sir stop Mother do you not know
who he is

HANNAH
What’s honor but the good report of mean and
ignorant folks The better sort I’m sure
cannot abide it

VINDICI
If she knew
What ‘’twere to lose it she would never
keep it
Virginity is paradise lock’d up
Oh think upon the pleasure of the palace
Secured ease and state the stirring meats
Ready to move out of the dishes
That e’en now quicken when they’re eaten
Banquets abroad by torch-light musics sports
Nine coaches waiting Hurry hurry hurry

CASTIZA
Ay to the devil

VINDICI
Why are there so few honest women but
Because ‘tis the poorer profession

HANNAH
Who’d sit at home in a neglected room
Dealing her short-liv’d beauty to the wall
hangings when those
Poorer in face and fortune than herself
Walk with a hundred acres on their backs
Fair meadows cut into green foreparts

CASTIZA
I cry you mercy Lady I mistook you
Pray did you see my mother Which way went
she Pray God I have not lost her

HANNAH
Ungrateful
Sir do you address YOUR Mother so

VINDICI
Alas I too have lost my Mother

He says this with great force and sorrow He turns and walks
out of the house HANNAH gives a little yelp of anguish

HANNAH
(to CASTIZA) Peevish Coy Foolish

35 Ext Four Bridges Dawn
HANNAH hurries blindly after VINDICI

HANNAH

Sir Sir -

(VINDICI turns)
Sir return this answer to the future Duke
My lord shall be most welcome when his
pleasure
Conducts him this way I will sway mine own
Women with women can work best alone

VINDICI
Indeed I’11 tell him so

With a broken heart VINDICI turns to go She calls him back

HANNAH
Sir my daughter said I know thee
Do I know thee From some other place
From some time before

He looks hard at her He wants to say something

VINDICI
Madam if you know me not you know me not

HANNAH puts out her hand For a moment he takes this to be
some last minute change-of-heart gesture

HANNAH
The jewel sir The jewel

He gives her the jewel Then he hurries away over the weird
rubblescape of Four Bridges The rising SUN is unnaturally
intensely bright

VINDICI (VO)
Oh more uncivil more unnatural
Than those base-titled creatures that look
downward
Why does not heaven turn black or with a
frown
Undo the world Why does not earth start up
And strike the sins that tread upon’t Oh
Wer’t not for gold and women there would be
no damnation
But ‘twas decree’d before the World began
That they shall be the hooks to catch a man

36 Ext Court Day
A trickle of people into the court

Most of them wear elaborate masks as protection against the
sun’s blast and the noxious air Some are blind

We see newspapers with headlines about JUNIOR’s crime
We overhear casual conversation about the trial and other
trivia The consensus seems to be that JUNIOR will get off

37Int- Tourneur Brothers’ Limo Day

Now that JUNIOR is under arrest there is a little more leg
room for LUSSURIOSO SPURIO SUPERVACUO and AMBITIOSO

They enjoy this The car stops

38 Ext Court Day

CARLO is waiting on the pavement with VINDICI He opens the
door of the TOURNEUR BROTHERS’ Limo and LUSSURIOSO gets out
LUSSURIOSO is pleased to see VINDICI doesn’t seem to notice

CARLO

We pick up VINDICI at the side of LUSSURIOSO as they hurry up
the stairs towards the court

LUSSURIOSO
Her Mothertook the jewel She should be
damn’d before the daughter

VINDICI
Oh that’s good manners my lord the mother
For her age must go foremost you know

LUSSURIOSO
She took the jewel That’s good Gold tho’
it be dumb does utter the best thanks
We’ll yet beguile her of salvation
And rub hell o’er with honey The Mother
has proved herself a whore therefore her
sons and daughters are born whores
Which is what we want

It’s a sweat for VINDICI to control himself at this
LUSSURIOSO turns and looks back down the steps to where his

BROTHERS are consorting with their cronies on the pavement
He confides in VINDICI ‘

LUSSURIOSO
I have mentioned that I am to be Duke after
my Father -

VINDICI

Once or twice my lord

LUSSURIOSO
I think it pricks my brothers’ hearts to envy
that I’m accounted great while they are but -
my brothers Watch them Tell me how they
look at me

He sweeps into the courtroom VINDICI stays behind on the
steps

39 Int Holding Cell Day

JUNIOR is sitting in the corner of the cell looking very

miserable He’s in chains His mother the DUCHESS enters

JUNIOR
Why have they locked me here

DUCHESS
Hush One of the Duke my husband’s single
words will set you free from death or
durance You will walk with bold feet on

the thorny law

JUNIOR
His withered grace don’t love me like the
others Mother

DUCHESS

Hush hush you are our dearest child
Fear not

She embraces him

40 Int Court Day

VINDICI is leading CARLO and CASTIZA into court
He flashes his security pass at some guards to get them in
As she passes inside CASTIZA covers her face with a mask

VINDICI
She should not be here

CARLO
She is safe here with her brothers

VINDICI
Beauty is nowhere safe Look

The prosecution team is passing by Among their number is
IMOGEN looking stricken but defiant her husband - ANTONIO
at her side CASTIZA is moved by this tragic sight

CASTIZA
That virtuous lady

VINDICI
A fair comely building newly fallen being
falsely undermin’d

41 Int Courtroom Day

The DUKE is sitting in state in the court The DUCHESS is
there too as is LUSSURIOSO

JUNIOR is now brought in smirking all over his face

He is taken to the stand The DUCHESS enters with him and
takes her seat in the front row not far from IMOGEN
LUSSURIOSO is with her

The DUKE calls the court to order

DUKE
Duchess it is our youngest son we’re sorry
His violent act has e’en draw blood of honour
and stained our honours

JUDGE
your Grace hath spoke like to your silver
years full of confirmed gravity for what is
it to have a flattering false insculption on a
tomb and in men’s hearts reproach

PICK UP ON CASTIZA whispering What (as in what’s he on
about) to CARLO who shushes her

DUKE
I leave him to your sentence doom him lords
while I sit by and sigh

The DUCHESS throws herself at the feet of the DUKE

DUCHESS
My gracious lord I pray be merciful although
his trespass far exceed his years he is your
own as I am yours call him not step son
(all glance at SPURIO)
Temper his fault with pity

AMBITIOSO
I beseech your Grace be soft and mild

SUPERVACUO
Let not relentless Law look with an iron
forehead on our brother
PICK UP ON another half-brother This one is SPURIO
SPURIO
(ASIDE) He yields small comfort yet
Yet there is hope that he shall die
Meanwhile on the main floor we see the DUCHESS

JUDGE
Let the offender stand forth -

DUCHESS
No pity yet Must I rise fruitless then
Are my knees of such low metal that without

respect

JUDGE
‘Tis the Duke’s pleasure that impartial doom
shall take fast hold of his unclean attempt
A rape Why ‘tis the very core of lust
and which was worse committed on the Lord
Antonio’s wife that chaste and upright lady
Confess my lord what moved you to’t

JUNIOR
Why flesh and blood what should move men to

women else

LUSSURIOSO
Oh do not jest they doom play not with thy
death The Law is a wise serpent and quickly
can beguile thee of they life

JUDGE
That lady’s name has spread such a fair wing
that if our tongues were sparing toward the
fact judgement itself would be condemned

JUNIOR
Well ‘tis done And ‘’twould please me well

to do it again

Gasps of horror surprise and titillation run around the court
The DUCHESS is distraught All these reactions are beyond

JUNIOR’s understanding

JUNIOR
What Sure she’s a goddess for I’d no power
to see her and to live It falls out true in
this for I must die

DUCHESS
No

JUNIOR
Her beauty was ordained to be my scaffold
And yet methinks I might be easier ceased
My fault being sport let me but die in jest

Some of JUNIOR‘’S CRONIES laugh uproariously at this one He
is clearly playing directly to them He is very pleased with
himself assuming he is going to be let off

JUDGE
This be the sentence

DUCHESS
Oh keep’t upon your tongue let it not slip
death too soon steals out of a lawyer’s lip

SPURIO
(ASIDE)

Now now he dies Rid ‘em away
JUDGE

This be the doom irrevocable
DUCHESS

Oh
JUDGE

Tomorrow early
DUCHESS

Pray stay abed my lord
JUDGE

Let that offender
DUCHESS

Live and be in health
JUDGE

Be on a scaffold
DUCHESS

No
DUKE

Hold hold
SPURIO

(ASIDE)

Poxon’t What makes my Dad speak now

DUKE
We will defer judgement till next sitting
In the meantime let him be kept close prisoner

JUNIOR is led away protesting

JUNIOR
Prisoner No Mother

SPURIO
(DISGUSTED ASIDE)
Delayed deferred and then if Judgement have
cold blood flattery and bribes will kill it
quite

PICK UP ON IMOGEN staring stony-faced after JUNIOR as he is
led away She speaks in an undertone to her companion

‘IMOGEN
Will he live then

COMPANION
He will my lady

IMOGEN’s face hardens She’s clearly made some kind of
terrible decision

42 Ext Court Day
CARLO is once again on car park duty

Spectators defendants and journalists are pouring out of the
court There are crash barriers on either side of the stairs
Crowds of people stand behind the barriers waiting to see the
trial celebrities

VINDICI is talking quietly to his brother

VINDICI
Our unnatural mother
Did with her tongue so hard beset Castiza’s
honour
That she was struck to silent wonder
Yet still she - like an unlighted taper -
Was cold and chaste save that our mother’s
breath
Did blow fire on her cheeks My lord she
said “Shall be most welcome when next his
pleasure brings him forth this way

CARLO
That shall be soon i’faith

VINDICI
I ha’ no way now to cross it but to kill him

CARLO
What Kill Lussurioso What of the Duke

VINDICI
I’11 murder both

CARLO
You will be busy brother

PICK UP ON THE DUCHESS emerging from the court sobbing
She is holding onto her son SPURIO She hisses discretely
with anger

The moment he sees her approach VINDICI is interested When
CARLO goes to open the car door for her VINDICI slides past
him and hears -

DUCHESS
Indeed ‘tis true an old man’s twice a child
Mine cannot speak one of his single words
Would quite have freed my son

SPURIO
Hush Mother he will be free by and by

The DUCHESS is very clingy and very sexy VINDICI grins goes
back to his brother and whispers -

VINDICI
Carlo the Gods protect our sister Here’s
a plan dropped down as neat as apples from
the bough how I may speed away both the old
Duke and his son

CARLO
What

VINDICI
Watch

He turns to see LUSSURIOSO hurrying down the steps towards him
VINDICI looks very pleased with himself He’s almost licking
his lips when he shakes hands with his Master

LUSSURIOSO
Carlo your absence leave us

CARLO accepts the instruction
LUSSURIOSO
A third man’s dangerous
Especially her brother
Suddenly a big cheer goes up from behind the crash barriers
LUSSURIOSO and VINDICI look to see what it is

It’s ANTONIO and IMOGEN emerging from the court They look
serious and drawn They head straight for their car

LUSSURIOSO
(RESENTFUL)
Every day another thousand voices raised
to his account

As ANTONIO descends the steps the chant begins again which we
first heard at the soccer match ’Tonio Tonio Tonio’

LUSSURIOSO fumes quietly

LUSSURIOSO
Here’s one that envies me my Dukedom

VINDICI
There’s more than one my lord

LUSSURIOSO stares at him understanding that VINDICI has some
new intelligence

VINDICI

Your brother Spurio my lord -
LUSSURIOSO

Spurio -
VINDICI

I can bring forth proofs that -

LUSSURIOSO
Hush Not here Come

43 Int The Intestines of the Palace DayNight

LUSSURIOSO leads VINDICI into an ancient staircase Daylight
shines through the doorway But as LUSSURIOSO and VINDICI
ascend the winding stairs the day vanishes and the stairway is

lit by shafts of blue moonlight

LUSSURIOSO
Here we are in th’intestines of my Father’s

palace

VINDICI
Is’t so

LUSSURIOSO
’Tis the deepest art to study man I’m well
practised at it I find you are a fellow of
discourse well-mingled whose brain time hath
season‘’d suitable both to my service and my
company Your estate should be more fellow to
your mind Trust me with thy preferment

VINDICI
Thanks my loved lord

LUSSURIOSO
Now tell me all my brother’s plots Who’s
in with him Tonio who the mob loves so

VINDICI
Sir your Mother

LUSSURIOSO is taken aback He gasps

VINDICI
The Duke your Father’s worthily abusd
The pen of his own son writes him cuckold

LUSSURIOSO
My brother and my Mother are - entangled

He’s genuinely shocked VINDICI seems sorry to have to tell
him

VINDICI
This night this hour this minute now

LUSSURIOSO
What What

VINDICI
Oh sin foul and deep
Great faults are wink’d at when the Duke’s

asleep

LUSSURIOSO
Horrible I am mad I will confound them
But what proofs

VINDICI
What need of proofs when you may take ‘em
twisted

LUSSURIOSO nods and leads off

LUSSURIOSO
Where is that villain

VINDICI
Softly my lord

PICK UP ON LUSSURIOSO leading VINDICI into a stone corridor at
the top of the stairs It is a service tunnel There are
doors and ventilators all the way along They pause by one
ventilator and listen

There are voices

They move on and hear at another the noise of lovemaking
They are underneath the DUCHESS’ room There’s a trap door
above them

VINDICI
This room

LUSSURIOSO
My Mother’s -

LUSSURIOSO unsheathes his dagger then shuts his eyes
It’s difficult to listen to this noise He puts his sword

away again

LUSSURIOSO
I cannot

VINDICI
Then Spurio will stab you as he stabs your
Mother

Suddenly the DUCHESS starts to orgasm noisily
LUSSURIOSO’s sword comes out again

LUSSURIOSO
I’ll kill ‘em doubled when they’re heap’d

VINDICI
Soft my lord

LUSSURIOSO opens up the trap door above him

44 Int The Duchess’ Bedroom Night

The DUCHESS lies back on the bed sweaty and satisfied

We can’t see who else is in the bed But we’re looking from
her point of view when suddenly LUSSURIOSO rises up sword in
hand apparently out of the floor

LUSSURIOSO
Villain strumpet Slapper

The DUCHESS screams

DUCHESS
Treason treason

Suddenly her lover appears from under the sheets
It’s her husband the DUKE He’s cross

DUKE
You upper guard defend us
(to LUSSURIOSO) Oh take me not in sleep
I have great sins I must have days
Nay months dear son with penitential sighs
To lift ‘em out and not to die in sin
Oh thou wilt kill me both in heaven and here

LUSSURIOSO
I am amaz‘’d to death

While LUSSURIOSO is confused the DUKE makes his move jumping
from his bed and first disarming then strong-arming his son

DUKE
Nay villain traitor
Worse than the foulest epithet now I’ll
gripe thee
E’en with the nerves of wrath and throw
thy head
Amongst the lawyers Guard

AMBITIOSO SUPERVACUO and SPURIO come hurrying in with a couple
of HEAVIES

LUSSURIOSO is increasingly afraid trying desperately to
placate his raging Dad

SPURIO
How comes the quiet of our Dad disturb’d

DUKE
This boy that should be myself after me
Would be myself before me and in heat
Of that ambition bloodily rush’d in
Intending to depose me in my bed

The DUKE nuts his son LUSSURIOSO falls to the floor
clutching his nose

SPURIO
Duty and natural loyalty forfend

DUCHESS
He call’d his father villain and me slapper
A word that I abhor to ’file my lips with

AMBITIOSO
That was not so well done brother

LUSSURIOSO
I know there’s no excuse can do me good

45 Int Palace Tunnel Night
CARLO has found VINDICI where LUSSURIOSO left him just below
the DUCHESS’s room

VINDICI
His vicious purpose to our sister’s honour
Is cross’d beyond our thought

CARLO
And the Duke Is he dead

VINDICI
Would he had kill’d him ‘’twould have eas’d

our swords
Be comforted he will die

46 Int Duchess’ Bedroom Night
The DUCHESS is weeping on the DUKE’s shoulder

DUKE
Be comforted our Duchess he shall die

The DUCHESS exits as the guards seize LUSSURIOSO
LUSSURIOSO
Nay then the truth of my intent shall out
My lord and Father hear me -

DUKE
Bear him hence

LUSSURIOSO
(to AMBITIOSO and SUPERVACUO ASIDE)
Brothers my best release lies on your tongues
I pray persuade for me

SUPERVACUO
We’1ll sweat in pleading

LUSSURIOSO
And I may live to thank you

AMBITIOSO
(ASIDE) No thy death shall thank me better

DUKE
To prison with the villain
Death shall not long lag after him

LUSSURIOSO is dragged away

AMBITIOSO
(to SUPERVACUO and SPURIO ASIDE)
Now brothers let our hate and love be woven
So subtly together that in speaking one word
for his life
We may make three for his death
The craftiest pleader gets most gold for breath

DUKE
Is’t possible a son
Should be disobedient as far as the sword
It is the highest he can go no farther

AMBITIOSO
My gracious lord take pity -
DUKE
Pity boys
AMBITIOSO
Nay we’d be loath to move your grace too

much
We know the trespass is unpardonable
Black wicked and unnatural

SUPERVACUO
In a son oh monstrous

AMBITIOSO

Yet my lord
A Duke’s soft hand strokes the rough head

of Law
And makes it lie smooth

DUKE
But my hand shall ne’er do’t

AMBITIOSO
That as you please my lord

SUPERVACUO
We must needs confess
Some father would have enter’d into hate
So deadly pointed that before his eyes
He would ha’ seen the execution sound
Without corrupted favour

AMBITIOSO
But my lord
Your grace may live the wonder of all times
In pard‘ning that offence which never yet
Had face to beg a pardon

DUKE
Honey How’s this

AMBITIOSO
Forgive him good my lord he’s your own son
And I must needs say ‘twas the vildlier done

SUPERVACUO
He’s the next heir yet this true reason
gathers -
None can possess that dispossess their
fathers
Be merciful -

DUKE
You have prevail’d
My wrath like flaming wax hath spent itself
I know ‘twas but some peevish moon in him
Go ‘let him be releasd

SUPERVACUO
(ASIDE to AMBITIOSO)
‘Sfoot how now brother

AMBITIOSO
Your grace doth please to speak beside your
spleen
I would it were so happy
DUKE
Why go release him
SUPERVACUO
Oh my good lord I know the fault’s too

weighty
And full of general loathing too inhuman
Rather by all men’s voices worthy death

DUKE
‘Tis true too
Here then receive this
(he dashes off a DEATH WARRANT)
doom shall pass Direct it to the judges
he shall die Ere many days Make haste

AMBITIOSO
All speed that may be
We could have wish’d his burden not so sore

We knew your grace did but delay before

Exeunt the remaining BROTHERS

DUKE
It well becomes that judge to nod at crimes
That does commit greater himself and lives
I may forgive a disobedient error
That expect pardon for adultery
And in my old days am a youth in lust
Many a beauty have I turn’d to poison
For rejecting me --

46F Int Marquee Day

We’re back in the Marquee now as we’ve seen it before

The end of the MASSACRE The GUESTS are vomiting dying
or have fled In the front of shot with his back to us is
the Mysterious Figure with the tray of drinks

The CAMERA comes round to the face of the Mysterious Figure and
we see that it is the DUKE --

DUKE (VO)
-- covetous of all
Age hot is like a monster to be seen
My hairs are white and yet my sins are green
PICK UP ON

The body of GLORIANA a few moments later spreadeagled on
the floor and outlined in chalk Screams and lamentations

fill the air
Behind her we notice a sign -- CATERING BY DUKE and SONS

47 Int Tourneur Brothers’ Limo Day

SUPERVACUO AMBITIOSO and SPURIO in the back of the Limo

There is plenty of room now

The brothers sit with wide spaces between them

SUPERVACUO
Brother let my opinion sway you once
I speak it for the best to have him die
Surest and soonest If the signet come
Unto the judges’ hands why then his doom
Will be deferr’d till sittings and court-days
Juries and further Faiths are bought and
sold
Oaths in these days are but the skin of gold

AMBITIOSO
In troth ‘tis true too

SPURIO
Then straightway to the officers and let the
judges wait ‘tis but mistaking
The Duke our father’s meaning and where he
nam‘’d
Ere many days ‘tis but forgetting that
And have him die - now

48 Int Jail Day
LUSSURIOSO sits despondently in his cell

The walls are made of metal sheets rivetted together

Suddenly a rivet drops out then another then another
‘LUSSURIOSO notices after the first one drops and makes a noise
He catches the next and then the next and helps ease the

plate out

LUSSURIOSO
(WHISPER) Brothers Are you there

He moves the plate aside to discover VINDICI
He is first astonished then enraged

LUSSURIOSO
You You lied to me You brought me to
this pass

VINDICI

If I had lied before would I now deliver
you You have been deceived but not by me

VINDICI beckons to him but LUSSURIOSO isn’t budging
VINDICI
If you’d as lief stay here then do I will
close the breach

He goes back through the hole pulling the panel into place
behind him He sticks his head back in

VINDICI
You commanded me keep watch upon your envious
brothers Know that they intend to speed your
execution lest the Duke your Father make
alteration of his edict

LUSSURIOSO
They want me killed

VINDICI
In a word

VINDICI goes LUSSURIOSO stands back then changes his mind
and hurries after VINDICI

49 Int Tunnels Day
VINDICI and LUSSURIOSO speeding away down one of the tunnels
LUSSURIOSO
I’m much indebted to your love for this

O Liberty Thou sweet and heavenly dame
But Hell for prison is too mild a name

50 IntJail Day

The TOURNEUR BROTHERS arrive in the prison’s main reception
There’s a little bed in the corner and a big selection of ropes
and nooses hanging from various hooks on the wall

AMBITIOSO
Officers here’s the Duke’s signature
your firm warrant
Brings the command of present death along
with it
Unto our brother the Duke’s son we are sorry
That we are so unnaturally employ’d
In such an unkind office --

SPURIO
-- Fitter far for enemies than brothers

SUPERVACUO
But you know
The Duke’s command must be obey’d

SUPERVACUO can barely contain his excitement He’s practically
giggling AMBITIOSO has to nudge him to shut him up

FIRST OFFICER
It must and shall my lord this morning then
So suddenly

AMBITIOSO
Ay alas poor good soul
He must breakfast betimes the executioner
Stands ready to put forth his cowardly valour

SECOND OFFICER
Already

An EXECUTIONER comes in He is dapper and genteel like Albert
Pierpoint He starts to examine the ropes and nooses

available

EXECUTIONER
Already i’faith Destruction hies

FIRST OFFICER
Troth we’ll take our leaves
Our office shall be sound we’1ll not delay
The third part of a minute

AMBITIOSO
Therein you show
Yourselves good men and upright officers

SPURIO
Pray let him die as private as he may
Do him that favour for the gaping people
Will but trouble him at his prayers

FIRST OFFICER
It shall be done my lord

AMBITIOSO
Why we do thank you if wé live to be
You shall have a better office

SUPERVACUO
Commend us to the scaffold in our tears

SECOND OFFICER
We’ll weep and do your commendations

51 Int Tourneur Brothers’ Limo Day

The BROTHERS are back in their places
They’re rolling around laughing with glee

AMBITIOSO
Fine fools in office

SUPERVACUO
Things fall out so fit --

SPURIO
So happily Come brother ere next clock
His head will be made serve a bigger block

AMBITIOSO
Excellent
Now am I heir Duke in a minute
The falling of one head lifts up another

The other two make eye contact between AMBITIOSO’s back
We get the distinct impression that he is wrong to be so
sanguine about his grip on power

52 Int Prison Corridors Day

A shot of LUSSURIOSO’s empty cell - the wall panel awry

Were looking through the peephole in the cell door along with
the TWO OFFICERS and the EXECUTIONER

They stare at each other in shocked surprise

FIRST OFFICER
The Duke’s son he was in here

EXECUTIONER
There is another Two cells down

SECOND OFFICER
But his death is not commanded

EXECUTIONER
(WILY READING EDICT)
My son — no name save only that
“my son - He is his son though his
neck is somewhat thicker

53 Int Cell Day
Come up on JUNIOR leafing through his pile of laddish

magazines The cellis well appointed There’s a TV a nice
bed with the cell phone left on the duvet cover

The door begins to open

JUNIOR
Keeper

Enter the EXECUTIONER

EXECUTIONER
My lord

JUNIOR
No news lately from our brothers
Are they unmindful of us

EXECUTIONER
My lord they left a message while you slept

JUNIOR
What was it

EXECUTIONER
They said be of good cheer you will not be

long a prisoner
He hands him a letter

JUNIOR
Nothing but paper comforts
I look’d for my delivery before this
Had they been worth their oaths

The OFFICERS come in

JUNIOR
How now What news

FIRST OFFICER
Bad news my lord I am discharg’d of you

JUNIOR
Slave call’st thou that bad news I thank

you brothers

FIRST OFFICER
My lord ‘twill prove so this is the officer
Into whose hands I must commit you

He points to the EXECUTIONER

SECOND OFFICER
Pardon us my lord
Our office must be sound here is our warrant
signed by the Duke you must prepare to die

JUNIOR
Sure ‘tis not so

SECOND OFFICER
It is too true my lord

JUNIOR
I tell you ‘tis not for the Duke my father
Deferr’d me till next sitting and I look
E’en every minute threescore times an hour
For a release a trick wrought by my brothers

FIRST OFFICER
A trick my lord If you expect such comfort
“Your hope’s as fruitless as a barren woman
Your brothers were the unhappy messengers
That brought this powerful token for your
death

JUNIOR
My brothers No no Desire ‘em hither
call ‘em up my brothers
They shall deny it to your faces

He produces his mobile phone and offers it to the OFFICERS

SECOND OFFICER
My lord
They’re far enough by this at least at court
And this most strict command they left behind
‘em
When grief swum in their eyes they show’d
like brothers
Brimful of heavy sorrow but the Duke
Must have his pleasure

EXECUTIONER
The hour beckons lift up your eyes to heaven

JUNIOR
I thank you faith good pretty wholesome
counsel
I should look up to heaven as you said
Whilst he behind me cheats me of my head
Ay that’s the trick

FIRST OFFICER
You delaytoo long my lord

JUNIOR
Stay good authority’s bastards since I must
Through brothers’ perjury die oh let me
venom
Their souls with curses

SECOND OFFICER
‘Tis no time to curse

The FIRST OFFICER opens a door

The EXECUTIONER goes through and slings the rope over a little

metal gallows

JUNIOR (VO)
My fault was sweet sport which the world
approves
I die for that which every woman loves

JUNIOR is executed End on the rope snapping tight

54 Ext Road Int Limo Day

The BROTHERS are still in their limo On the cut as if in
response to the rope tightening we see the windscreen shatter

The BROTHERS all jump in fright

Suddenly a MOB surrounds the car and starts to rock it
banging on the roof and windows The BROTHERS are terrified

AMBITIOSO
What’s this Is our conspiracy discover‘’d

SPURIO
Drive on Drive over them

The DRIVER revs his engine tries to pull away from the crowd

54A ‘The BROTHERS’ FOLLOW-UP TRUCK rounds the corner behind
them BODYGUARDS riding in the back open up with FIRE HOSES
knocking the RIOTERS aside

SUPERVACUO
What is it What a coil is here

SPURIO
Hush brother listen

He has switched on the in-car TV He turns up the sound

54yV ANTONIO is on the screen talking sombrely direct to
camera He’s at the entrance to his house surrounded by NEWS

CREWS His voice is measured modulated

ANTONIO (ON TV)
My long grief I will cut into short words

Last revelling night
When flood-light made an artificial noon
At Anfield some courtiers at the match -

SUPERVACUO
Oh Christ she’s dead

They all know that this is good for ANTONIO

55 Int Bar Day

A crowd of customers stares up at the multiple TVs where
ANTONIO is continuing his speech

ANTONIO (ON TV)
- Singled out that dear form who ever livd
As cold in lust as she is now in death
Which that step-duchess’ monster knew too
well
And therefore in the height of all the revels
When music was heard loudest courtiers
busiest
And ladies great with laughter - oh vicious
minute

56Int The Duke’s Palace Day
The DUKE is watching the TV alone in his office
his face like steel BAR FOOTBALL TABLE present

56V ANTONIO (ON TV)
Then with a face more impudent than his
vizard
He harried her amidst a throng of panders
That live upon damnation of both kinds
And fed the ravenous vulture of his lust

S72 Int Tunnel Day

CARLO and VINDICI are watching a snowy version of the same
broadcast on an old-fashioned black and white portable

LUSSURIOSO is with them

57V ANTONIO (ON TV)
Oh death to think on’t She her honour
fore’d
Deem’d it a nobler dowry for her name
To die with poison than to live with shame
Dead
Her honour first drunk poison and her life
Being fellows in one house did pledge her
honour

On TV the shot gets wider as ANTONIO goes back inside his
house We see the crowd of mourners and reporters outside

We see people laying flowers and teddy bears on the pavement
outside ANTONIO’s house
58 Ext Antonio’s House Day

The pavement is now ‘thick with flowers and teddy bears
One OLD WOMAN is placing her bouquet on top of the pile

59 Int Antonio’s House Day

ANTONIO is showing a group of reporters around his mansion
There’s a huge tacky soft focus photograph of IMOGEN
There’s a teddy bear collection There’s a big photo of
IMOGEN with Arthur Askey

ANTONIO
Behold my lords
A sight that strikes man out of me

He opens a door and shows them into a room where the body
of IMOGEN is laid out like Evita Lillies teddy bears
photographs prayers

ANTONIO
I mark’d not this before
A prayer book the pillow to her cheek
This was her rich confection and another
Plac’d in her right hand (CONT )

ANTONIO (CONT)
with a leaf tuck’d up
Pointing to these words
Better to die virtuous than live
dishonoured

The NEWS CREW breaks into applause

60 Int Street Day

People in the street watching all this on a big screen also
begin to applaud The applause is like a wave that has rolled
out of ANTONIO’s house and into the streets

61Int Tunnel Day

VINCIDI and CARLO applaud the TV greatly enthused

62 Int Bar Evening

In the bar most of the audience is also applauding
TWO GUYS in the bar are discussing the death of IMOGEN

one of them is drawing on a beer mat the trajectory of the
fatal bullet He is saying that there is no way she committed
suicide

The applause continues over their conversation

MAN
Look that’s where the bullet went in
Back of the head right Not at point blank
range She’d have to be a double jointed
octopus She did not top herself And and
and I heard someone say there were two
different bullets

MAN 2
What’re you saying

MAN
I’m saying the Duke’s lot saw her off

MAN 2
Or Tonio’s

MAN
The noble Lord Antonio’s

MAN 2
Why not

MAN
Stitch that

He thumps MAN 2

54 stati tial

CASTIZA and HIPPOLITO are walking up a long deserted tunnel
They too are discussing the suicide of Imogen

CASTIZA
For sure ‘twas suicide I would do the same
should such a one as him come near me -

They suddenly freeze in their tracks The THUGS we saw at the
opening of the film have appeared again Limping now with
arms in slings They surround HIPPOLITO and CASTIZA

HIPPOLITO pulls a GUN on them though he is trembling The
first THUG laughs Takes the gun off him and points it in
HIPPOLITO’s face HIPPOLITO doesn’t seem scared

The THUG pulls the trigger Instead of a bullet the flag with
the word Bang pops out

HIPPOLITO tries to make a joke of it The THUG laughs briefly
then makes to hit him with the butt --

Suddenly a voice is heard

VINDICI
Sister

The THUGS looks behind and see VINDICI and CARLO walking
towards them VINDICI is unhurried He seems not to see the
THUGS at all He addresses himself to CASTIZA

VINDICI
There is no safety here

The THUGS all flee on crutches VINDICI barely acknowledges
their existence

CASTIZA
Here am I safest here with my brothers

G64 Int Catacombs Day
Even down here you can hear the applause

The entrance is still dominated by a huge poster of the DUKE
There are still OLD WOMEN attending to shattered remains
They are applauding too

AMBITIOSO and SUPERVACUO enter in funeral black carrying a
huge bouquet of flowers in the shape of the words “Our

Brother

AMBITIOSO
Was not this execution rarely plotted
I am the Duke’s heir now

SUPERVACUO
Ay you may thank my policy for that

AMBITIOSO
Your policy for what

SUPERVACUO
Why was ‘t not my invention brother
To slip the judges and in lesser compass
Advising you to sudden execution

AMBITIOSO
Heart ‘twas a thing I thought on too

SUPERVACUO
You thought on’t too ‘Sfoot slander not
your thoughts
With glorious untruth ‘Twas not so

AMBITIOSO
Sir I say ’twas in my head

SUPERVACUO
Ay like your brains then
Ne’er to make their presence felt as long
as you liv’d

AMBITIOSO
You’d have the honour on’t forsooth that
your wit

Led him to the scaffold

SUPERVACUO
Since it is my due
I’ll publish ‘t but I’11 ha’t in spite of
you

AMBITIOSO
Methinks y’are too bold you should a little
Remember us brother next to be honest Duke

SUPERVACUO
Ay it shall be as easy for you to be Duke
As to be honest and that’s never i’faith

AMBITIOSO
Well cold he is by this time and because
Were both ambitious be it our amity
And let the glory be shar’d equally

SUPERVACUO
I am content to that

They pass a niche in which VINDICI is mourning again his lost
true love They don’t see him but he watches them go
He’s spying on them

642 Int Another Part of the Catacombs

PICK UP ON the BROTHERS again They approach another niche in
which a fresh body is laid out watched by a pair of uniformed

GUARDS

AMBITIOSO
Here’s where our older brother’s corse lies

in state

SUPERVACUO
(ASIDE to AMBITIOSO)
Ha ha excellent

AMBITIOSO
(ASIDE to SUPERVACUO)
All’s sure our own brother canst weep
think’st thou
‘Twould grace our flattery much Think
of some dame -

SUPERVACUO
(ASIDE to AMBITIOSO)
I’ll try
Now for yourself

AMBITIOSO
Our sorrows are so fluent
Our eyes o’erflow our tongues words spoke in

tears
Are like the murmurs of the waters the sound

Is loudly heard but cannot be distinguish’d

Enter the SECOND OFFICER also with a wreath

SUPERVACUO
How died he pray

SECOND OFFICER
Oh full of rage and spleen

SUPERVACUO
He died most valiantly then we’re glad to
hear it

SECOND OFFICER
We could ‘not woo him once to pray

AMBITIOSO
He show’d himself a gentleman in that

SECOND OFFICER
But in the stead of prayer
He drew forth oaths

SUPERVACUO
Then did he pray dear heart
Although you understood him not

SECOND OFFICER
My lords
E’en at his last with pardon be it spoke
He curs’d you both

SUPERVACUO
He curs’d us ‘Las good soul

AMBITIOSO
It was not in our powers but the Duke’s
pleasure

Footsteps approach and two more figures appear out of the dark
into the ghostly anbaric light They’re also in mourning and
carrying a big wreath of flowers

They are VINDICI and - the last person the BROTHERS expect to
see — LUSSURIOSO

LUSSURIOSO
Now my lords

AMBITIOSO SUPERVACUO
Oh Sweet Heaven defend us

They are terrified

LUSSURIOSO
Why do you shun me brothers
You may come nearer now
The savour of the prison has forsook me
I thank such kind lords as yourselves
I’m free

AMBITIOSO
Alive

SUPERVACUO
In health

AMBITIOSO
Releas‘d
We were both e’en amaz’d with joy to see it

LUSSURIOSO
I am much to thank you

SUPERVACUO
Faith we spar’d no tongue unto my lord the
Duke

AMBITIOSO
I know your delivery brother
Had not been half so sudden but for us

SUPERVACUO
Oh how we pleaded

LUSSURIOSO
Most deserving brothers
In my best studies I will think of it

Exeunt LUSSURIOSO and VINDICI PICK UP ON their whispered
confidences

VINDICI
Saw you not their guilt jumping oe’r their
vizards like maggots on the faces of dead men

LUSSURIOSO
Be sure I did

He puts his arm round VINDICI - a gesture of trust and thanks
Back to the BROTHERS —

AMBITIOSO
Oh death and vengeance

SUPERVACUO
Hell and torments

AMBITIOSO
Slave cam’st thou to delude us

SECOND OFFICER
Delude you my lords

SUPERVACUO
Ay villain whose is this corse now

SECOND OFFICER
Why your brother sirs and the Duke’s son

He pulls back the sheet to reveal the corpse of JUNIOR

SUPERVACUO
Plagues

AMBITIOSO
Confusions

SUPERVACUO
Darkness

AMBITIOSO
Devils

SUPERVACUO
Our younger brother

AMBITIOSO
There’s no advantage in the killing of a
YOUNGER brother

SUPERVACUO

SECOND OFFICER
Oh my good lord

Exit SECOND OFFICER running

SUPERVACUO

The devil overtake thee
AMBITIOSO

Oh fatal
SUPERVACUO

Oh prodigious to our bloods

AMBITIOSO
Did we dissemble

SUPERVACUO
Did we make our tears women for thee

AMBITIOSO
Laugh and rejoice for thee

SUPERVACUO
You had a trick you had a wile forsooth

AMBITIOSO
The clap eat them There’s none of these wiles
That ever come to good I see now
There is nothing sure in mortality but
mortality

DUKE
Whose fault is this catastrophe

The brothers jump shocked by the sudden unannounced presence
of the DUKE who is also wearing mourning and carrying a
wreath

AMBITIOSO
We know not sir

SUPERVACUO
The Fates

AMBITIOSO

Not us sir

SUPERVACUO
Well leave you to your grief sir

The DUKE sinks to his knees and pulls out his rosary beads

65 Int Tourneur Brothers’ Limo Day

There are now only two brothers - SUPERVACUO and AMBITIOSO -
in the car They sit a long way apart There’s plenty of
room

66 Int Catacombs Day

The DUKE is kneeling at the side of his son’s corpse praying
on his beads

We realise we are looking at this from the POV of VINDICI

VINDICI (VO)
Oh shall I kill him a’ th’ wrong side now
No
Sword thou wast never a back-biter yet
I‘ll pierce him to his face he shall die
looking upon me

VINDICI coughs The DUKE turns and notices him Looks at him
strangely

DUKE
My veins are swell’d with lust

VINDICI
This’ shall unfill ‘em
Great men were gods if beggars couldn’t kill
‘em

He pulls his dagger and steps forward to kill the DUKE
The DUKE laughs ignores the dagger He seems pleased to see
VINDICT

DUKE
Sirrah I know thee Come

There’s something seedy about his sudden matey tone
He keeps looking around to make sure no one is looking
He stuffs the rosary beads back into his pocket

DUKE
Are you not a pandar or a pimp Did you
not provide a lady for my son

VINDICI
My Lord I was commanded -

DUKE
Good good Can you do likewise for me

VINDICI grins with relief It also dawns on him that this
finally is his big chance

DUKE
Could you not greet me with a lady in some
fair place veil’d from the eyes a’ th’ court
some darkened blushless angle

VINDICI
My Lord I could I know an unsunn’d lodge
wherein ‘tis night at noon

DUKE
And a lady You know a lady

VINDICI
One with two heaven-pointed diamonds set
for eyes in a face
Far far beyond the artificial shine
Of any woman’s bought complexion

DUKE
(NOT SURE) Hmm I had such a one before
She would not consent unto my lust
VINDICI
(ROCKED) You remember her The one who
would not consent
DUKE
I do It only happened once I had to

have her killed (GRINS) I had my way with
her thereafter

It’s all VINDICI can do to restrain himself But he does

VINDICI
I will collect you sir

He goes

66A Int Catacombs Day

We go with him down the catacomb

He passes the place where the remains of his true love lie
He stops embraces them Puts his cheek against her SKULL

VINDICI
Soon soon You will rest easy

With the remains still cradled in his arms he walks out into
the open air

G1 Ext Antonio’s House Day

VINDICI with his grotesque bundle walks past the pile of
flowers and teddy bears outside ANTONIO’s house He picks up
a big lanky teddy and drapes it over his shoulder

68 Int Off License Day

The WOMAN behind the counter puts a bottle of champagne into
a carrier bag and hands it to VINDICI He takes it and drops
the SKULL in after the bottle

VINDICI
Another bag

She hands him another bag He puts the other BONES in that

69 Int Carlo’s Portakabin Evening

VINDICI has just arrived carrying his shopping bags
He’s just told CARLO and CASTIZA what the DUKE has asked

CARLO
Ay but where’s the lady

VINDICI
You shall be witness
Be ready stand with your hats off

He produces the SKULL from the carrier bag
CASTIZA shrinks in horror

VINDICI
Art thou beguil’d now Have I not fitted the
old surfeiter
With a quaint piece of beauty Age and bare
bone
Are e’er allied in action here’s an eye
Able to tempt a great man to serve God
A pretty hanging lip that has forgot now to
dissemble
Methinks this mouth should make a swearer
tremble
A drunkard clasp his teeth and not undo ‘em
To suffer wet damnation to run through ‘em

CASTIZA
Is this the form that living shone so bright

VINDICISKULL
He had me once and now he shall again

CASTIZA puts her arm on VINDICI’s arm
VINDICI looks thoughtfully at the SKULL

VINDICI
Does every proud and self-affecting dame
Camphor her face for this and grieve her maker
In sinful baths of milk when many an infant

starves

For her superfluous outside - all for this
Who now bids twenty pound a night prepares
Music perfumes and sweetmeats All are
hush’d

Thou mayst lie chaste now It were fine

methinks
To have thee seen at revels forgetful feasts

And unclean brothels

FLASH TO VINDICI’S VISION --
69A Ext Bold St Night
-- a GIANT SKULL hanging in the air over the giant screens of

Concert Square red hair ablaze glaring down at the screaming
terrified REVELLERS - all multi-media as before

VINDICI VO
Sure ‘twould fright the sinner
And make him a good coward put a reveller
Out of his antic amble
And cloy an epicure with empty dishes
Here might a scornful and ambitious woman
Look through and through herself -

69 I tarlo’s Portakabi E
VVINDICI ventriloquises through the SKULL -

VINDICISKULL
See ladies with false forms
You deceive men but cannot deceive worms

CASTIZA shrinks away VINDICI pulls out a medicine bottle from
one of the shopping bags and starts to pour its contents onto
the skull’s teeth These hiss and steam as the liquid makes

contact
The SKULL sings by ventriloquism -

SKULL
Up and down up and down till they’re clean

and sparkly

CARLO
What is it

VINDICI
Poison

He ventriloquises a scream of fright from the SKULL

VINDICI
(to CASTIZA)
You’ll help me in my deadly enterprise

She nods

VINDICI
Thanks (THROUGH SKULL) Thank you

He produces a beautiful blue translucent dress from one of the
shopping bags and passes it to her

Then he picks up the big lanky teddy and wrenches off its
head

170 Int Duke’s Bedroom Evening
The DUKE has just put on a rather snazzy shirt He admires

himself in his full length mirror and does a fairly stable
samba He adores himself

11 carlo’s Portakabi cvening

CASTIZA is trying on the dress and studying her face in the
little mirror She puts on a red wig

VINDICI is still pouring poison on the SKULL‘s teeth

12IntDuke’s Bedroom Evening

The DUKE puts on a splash of after shave

13 Int Carlo’s Portakabin Evening

CARLO hands VINDICI a set of keys

7 pall Stadi ight

A huge Mercedes pulls up outside the Shankly gates
The DUKE appears slightly dubious as he dismisses his DRIVER

DUKE
You have leave to leave me with this charge
If I’m missed by the Duchess say I’m privately
rid forth

VINDICI is watchinglistening to this from the shadows

VINDICI
(ASIDE) Oh happiness Privately rid forth

As the DUKE’s car pulls away VINDICI appears from the shadows

DUKE
Here

VINDICI shushes him and beckons him to the gates He opens
them with the keys CARLO gave him and waves the DUKE through

ball Pitc Nigt
VINDICI leads the DUKE through to the vast hushed softly-lit
prairie of the pitch It’s beautiful The DUKE’s still
nervous

DUKE
Soft Someone is near

They listen for a moment VINDICI is smiling indulgently as
if to say I know who it is and you’re not to worry

The sound becomes clearer It’s the sound of a COUPLE making
love

VINDICI
Another pair of lovers This is a most
excellent place in which to score

The DUKE tries to laugh at the joke but is still nervous
Suddenly he catches sight of someone emerging from the shadows
and walking across the pitch A redhead We know it’s

CASTIZA

DUKE
Who’s that

VINDICI
It’s her It’s yours

The disguised CASTIZA looks over at the DUKE then starts to
shashay seductively towards the manager’s dug out over at the
other side of the pitch

The front of the dug out is fringed with sparkly curtains
She slides through them

The DUKE is still transfixed and some way behind

76 Int Dug Out Night

CASTIZA plunges in through the curtains tearing off the
translucent gown

CARLO is there waiting to help her He hands her a t-shirt
and starts to put the headless teddy bear into the gown

CARLO
The head the head -

CASTIZA goes to pick up the poisoned SKULL He prevents her

CARLO
Wait The poison

He picks it up gingerly and plonks it on the neck of the
headless teddy bear

12 Ext Pitch Night

VINDICI is leading the DUKE towards the dug out

DUKE
What lady is’t

VINDICI
Faith my lord a country lady a little
bashful at first as most of them are but
after the first kiss my lord the worst is
past with them Your grace knows now what you
have to do sh’as somewhat a grave look with
her -

DUKE
I love that best
In gravest looks the greatest faults seem less
Give me that sin that’s rob’d in holiness

VINDICI
Take this ‘twill stiffen your resolve
Cover your eyes lest her beauty blind you

The DUKE covers his eyes and takes the pill which VINDICI
proffers him VINDICI takes him by the hand and calls out

VINDICI
Madam his grace will not be absent long

While the DUKE’s eyes are covered CARLO and CASTIZA dive out
of the dug out CASTIZA hides and takes over ventriloquism

duties

CASTIZASKULL
Is all truly secret I heard another pair
of lovers

DUKE
Is that her Her voice is sweet

VINDICI
(REPLYING TO THE DUG OUT)
Secret Ne’er doubt us madam ‘twill be worth
Three velvet gowns to your ladyship

VINDICI leads the DUKE through the fringed curtain of the dug
out

18 Int Dug Out Night

Inside there’s the dull light of a perfumed candle playing over
the champagne and sweets and in the corner the glow of velvet
and blonde where the ‘lady’ lies Again CASTI2ZA
ventriloquises the lady’s voice

DUKE
How sweet can a Duke breathe

CASTIZASKULL
Pleasure dwells in a perfumed mist

DUKE
Lady sweetly encount’red I came from court -

CASTIZASKULL
Sir be bold with me - kiss my lips

DUKE
Madam I will

He lunges at the lady and snogs her It doesn’t take him long
to suss that something’s wrong

DUKE
Oh What’s this
VINDICI
Royal villain white devil
DUKE
Oh
VINDICI
Brother give us light that his affrighted
eyeballs

May start into those hollows Duke dost know
Yon dreadful vizard View it well ‘tis the
skull

Of Gloriana whom thou poisoned’st last

VINDICI pulls back the curtain just as the FLOODLIGHTS fire up
pouring light into the dug out and exposing the SKELETON

DUKE
Oh ’t ’as poisoned me

VINDICI
Didst not know that till now

DUKE
Call treason

CARLO
(STAMPING ON HIM)
Yes my good lord treason treason treason

For good measure CARLO zaps the DUKE with his TASER

DUKE
Then I’m betray’d

VINDICI
Alas poor lecher in the hands of knaves
A slavish Duke is baser than his slaves

DUKE
My teeth are eaten out

VINDICI
Hadst any left Then those that did eat are

eaten

DUKE
Oh my tongue

VINDICI
Your tongue ’Twill teach you to kiss closer
not like a slobbering Dutchman
You have eyes still -

DUKE
They hurt

VINDICI
The little pill I gave thee was a potion to
prevent blinking You cannot blink I gave
it that thou’d miss
Not one blinking moment of all this -

He twists the DUKE’s head round to look at the big screen above
the pitch It flickers into life

VINDICI
‘Tis but early yet now I’11 begin
To stick thy soul with ulcers I will make
Thy spirit grievous sore it shall not rest
But like some pestilent man toss in thy breast
Mark me Duke

Thou’rt a renowned high and mighty cuckold
A giant image of the other two lovers in the ground -

the DUCHESS and her son SPURIO

VINDICI
Incestuous sweets between ‘em

The DUKE gasps in horror

DUKE
Millions of deaths

VINDICI
Nay to afflict thee more
Here in this lodge they meet for damnéd clips
Those eyes shall see the incest of their lips

He watches his wife and son writhing on the screen
Has an apoplectic fit and dies

VINDICI - like a hellish game show host - rams a microphone
into the DUKE’s mouth to catch his last gasps These are
amplified around the whole pitch

cuT TO

T8A The Duke and Dutchess’s Directors’ Box

Where the DUCHESS and SPURIO are still at it

SPURIO
Had not that kiss a taste of sin ‘Twas sweet

DUCHESS
Why there’s no pleasure but ‘tis sinful

The DUCHESS hears a noise - it is the dying groans of her
husband echoing around the stadium She looks up sees herself
on the screen and curses

DUCHESS
Sweet Christ

SPURIO looks up and also curses They hurry into their
clothes

CUT TO

18B The Pitch
Where CASTIZA and CARLO have now joined VINDICI They are all

looking up at the two mortified people on the big screen
They‘re laughing
CARLO
Brother I do applaud thy constant vengeance
The quaintness of thy malice above thought
The image on the big screen freezes

A different magazine with a similar cover next to it

A whole rack of magazines - all different all with the same

79 Int Tunnel Night

CASTIZA VINDICI and CARLO are pushing a skip down a disused
railway line in an ill-lit tunnel Water drips down the walls
But these three are dancing with joy as they ship the DUKE’S
CORPSE

VINDICI
Ah the fly-flop of vengeance beat ‘em to
pieces
This was the sweetest occasion the fittest
hour to make my revenge
Oh my heart wears feathers that before wore
lead
The Duke is dead dead dead dead dead

80 Ext Tunnel Night

They emerge from the tunnel stop and look into the night sky
A new Moon and a HUGE COMET spread above the city skyline
They marvel at it

CARLO
Over what roof hangs this prodigious comet
In deadly fire

VINDICI
A blessing on our enterprise

CASTIZA

Sweet angel of Revenge

More of those magazines with SPURIO and the DUCHESS on the
cover They are spread on a table in the hallway of the
palace

LUSSURIOSO is looking at them He flings them all aside

83 Int Duke’s Palace - Dining Room Day

The DUCHESS SPURIO AMBITIOSO and various courtiers including
VINDICI are eating breakfast at the big table when LUSSURIOSO
strides in

LUSSURIOSO
Who has seen the Duke my Father

People look questioningly at each other

LUSSURIOSO
(to VINDICI)
You saw you my lord and Father

VINDICI shakes his head then LUSSURIOSO asks everyone around
the table

LUSSURIOSO
And you And you Or you What of you
Well well he’s sure from court but where
which way his pleasure took we know not
nor can hear on’t

AMBITIOSO
I heard he privately rode forth

LUSSURIOSO
‘twas wondrous private There’s none in
court has any knowledge of’t

DUCHESS
My husband’s old and sudden ‘Tis no
treason to say he has a humour or such
a toy about him

LUSSURIOSO
I say he’s ridden forth from shame
from infamy from this house of incestous
scheming -

They all look a bit puzzled till he throws the magazines onto
the table The picture of SPURIO and the DUCHESS is there for
all to see

AMBITIOSO
Is that not oh I see it is

The DUCHESS is mortified SPURIO is jumpy

DUCHESS
When my lord the Duke sees this

LUSSURIOSO
The Duke is fled for shame And so
the Duke is here in my person -

There’s a howl of protest but he silences it with a gesture

LUSSURIOSO
Until he does return So - GUARDS -
let her be kept close prisoner
Guard bear her hence And him take
both of them

The DUCHESS protests vociferously as the GUARDS come pouring

in They take the DUCHESS and SPURIO During the furore
there’s a telling moment of eye contact between LUSSURIOSO and

VINDICI
The DUCHESS thumps the GUARDS around
DUCHESS
Are you so barbarous to set iron nipples
Upon the breast that gave you suck

The GUARDS are all revolted by this line They pull funny
faces and unhand her

DUCHESS
Am I not your Mother

VINDICI coolly steps up to her and lays his hand upon her
VINDICI
Thou dost usurp that title now by fraud
For in that shell of mother breeds a bawd

As the scene breaks up in walks SUPERVACUO in his dressing
gown all unaware

SUPERVACUO
Brothers and Lords what’s for breakfast

The front page shows the DUCHESS and SPURIO at it
Now he finds this amusing

86 Ext Four Bridges Day
VINDICI and CARLO are striding towards their Mother’s house

The energy that has been speeding through VINDICI since the
DUKE’s death is still there

VINDICI
Our own dam was the worser This Duchess
made herself a whore our Ma a whore out
of her daughter

CARLO
The Duke’s son’s great concubine
A drab of state a cloth-a’-silver slut
fo have her train borne up and her soul trail
I’ th’ dirt great
And never just the Duke’s son first begins

with one
Who afterward to thousand proves a whore
Break ice in one place it will crack in

more

He pulls out his TASER VINDICI is almost taken aback by the
venom of CARLO’s tirade

Then HANNAH answers the door --

and CARLO charges in like a bull

87 Int Hannah’s Day

We follow the BROTHERS and their terrified MOTHER into the
house ‘ ot

CARLO
Oh thou for whom no name is bad enough

He prepares to zap her But HANNAH hardly hears him She
reaches out to touch VINDICI’s face amazed

HANNAH
Son Is this my son come back

VINDICI is thrown All the anger in him dies

VINDICI
And do you know me now

CARLO however has been whipped up into a fevered state
He is not about to slow down

CARLO
Wicked unnatural parent
Fiend of women

(CONT )

CARLO (CONT )
Did not the Duke’s son direct
A fellow of the world’s condition hither
That did corrupt all that was good in thee
Made thee uncivilly forget thyself
And work our sister to his lust

HANNAH
Who I
That had been monstrous I defy that man
For any such intent none lives so pure
But shall be soil’d with slander
Good son believe it not

CARLO
Ha He was that man

HANNAH
(to VINDICI)
You My own son tricked me

VINDICI is embarrassed He makes an excuse

VINDICI
In that disguise I was sent from the Duke’s

son —
But there is no slowing CARLO down

CARLO
He tried you and found you base metal
As any villain might have done

HANNAH
A rich man tricked a beggar Is this news
Is it good

CARLO
Oh nimble in damnation quick in tune
There is no devil could strike fire so soon

He produces his dagger He is quivering with overwrought
emotion

HANNAH however is not afraid of her son’s knife

HANNAH

Sons
Forgive me to myself I’1ll prove more true
You that should honour me I kneel to you

VINDICI
Nay

He says this so definitely that CARLO is finally stopped
VINDICI gently wipes one of his Mother’ s tears with his finger
and shows it to CARLO

VINDICI
Brother it rains ‘twill spoil your dagger
house it

CARLO
‘Tis done

VINDICI
I’faith ‘tis a sweet shower it does much

good
Rise mother troth this shower has made you

higher

HANNAH
To weep is to our sex naturally given
But to weep truly that’s a gift from heaven

VINDICI
Nay I’ll kiss you now Kiss her brother
Let’s marry her to our souls wherein’s no lust
And honourably love her

CARLO
Let it be

HANNAH
I’11 give you this that one I never knew
Plead better for and ‘gainst the Devil than
you

VINDICI
You make me proud on’t

88 A s Li D
LUSSURIOSO is still luxuriating in the Limo
Finally he is all alone It stops to collect VINDICI

LUSSURIOSO
Thy name I have forgot it

VINDICI
Vindici my lord

LUSSURIOSO
‘Tis a good name that

VINDICI
Ay a revenger

LUSSURIOSO
It does betoken courage thou shouldst be
valiant
And kill thine enemies

VINDICI
That’s my hope my lord

LUSSURIOSO grins at him

89 Int Bar Evening

LUSSURIOSO and VINDICI enter a bar and are conducted to an
exclusive and secluded table beneath a huge poster of the DUKE

They already have drinks in their hands They’re quite tiddly

LUSSURIOSO
Tell me what has made thee so melancholy

VINDICI
Why to think how a great rich man lies
a-dying and a poor cobbler tolls the bell

for him

VINDICI shakes his head sadly

LUSSURIOSO
There’s hope in you for discontent and want
Is the best clay to mould a villain of
You know I might advance you and build fair
Your fortunes for it might be in me
To rear up towers from cottages

LUSSURIOSO tosses back his drink calls for more
He leans forward and starts to confide quietly in VINDICI

LUSSURIOSO
I will unbrace such a close private villain
Unto your vengeful sword the like ne’er

heard of

VINDICI
What was his sin

LUSSURIOSO
He is a royal lecher Royal and a lecher and
royally a lecher More than once when one
would not consent unto his lust he had them
poisoned

VINDICI
What is his name

LUSSURIOSO
You know him

LUSSURIOSO nods discretely at the picture of his Father

VINDICI (VO)
Oh thou almighty patience ‘tis my wonder
That such a fellow impudent and wicked
Should not be cloven as he stood
Or with a secret wind burst open
Is there no thunder left or is’t kept up
In stock for heavier vengeance

The sound of THUNDER comes roaring in The lights go out
being sensitive to atmospheric disturbance

VINDICI
There it goes

LUSSURIOSO
What

VINDICI

Nothing Thunder

90Ext Alley Night
Big clouds Lightning Thunder The Comet

VINDICI and the stinking‘drunk LUSSURIOSO are running down an
alley to keep out of the astonishing rain They hide ina
doorway

VINDICI
Shall I kill thee now while th’art drunk

LUSSURIOSO
Ay best of all for then 1I’11 not live to
be sober

VINDICI
And you may reel to hell No

LUSSURIOSO
Why not

VINDICI
For being so full of liquor I fear you’1ll
put out all the fire

LUSSURIOSO
Thou art a mad beast

LUSSURIOSO thinks this is hilarious But something big is on
his mind so he never quite loses the whole plot

LUSSURIOSO
Besides I’m not the villain the one I talked
of You know him You do know him

VINDICI
I know him He is your -

Another clap of thunder and a flash of lightning

LUSSURIOSO

Sssssh You know I have imprison’d my own

Mother
VINDICI

I know
LUSSURIOSO

If the Duke comes back then ‘tis treason
VINDICI

Oh - yes If
LUSSURIOSO

If For if he comes not back -
VINDICI

Who shall be Duke then
LUSSURIOSO

VINDICI

I think you did
LUSSURIOSO

So swear
VINDICI

You still love swearing
LUSSORIOSO

Swear
VINDICI

My Lord it shall be so

91 Ext Antonio’s House Day
The flowers and teddy bears left in tribute to IMOGEN are still
there

A busload of SCHOOL CHILDREN has just arrived Each CHILD is
carrying a teddy bear or flowers They pour off the bus and
lay their gifts with those that have gone before

The camera moves along the line of teddy bear faces each one
staring at us blankly

VINDICI (V0)
Oh well- And Murder will peep out

Suddenly the camera comes to rest on one face that’s not the
face of a teddy bear It’s the murdered DUKE staring out from

among the soft toys

A CHILD screams
A siren wails

92 Ext The Royal Exchange Building Day

CARLO and VINDICI are sitting in the gold cupola on the top of
this imperious building From here they can see AMBULANCES

racing round the streets

CARLO
Thus much by wit a deep revenger can pull off
When murder’s known to be the fardest off

In the distance another ambulance goes screaming past
VINDICI allows himself a little grin

93 Int St George’s Hall Day

AMBITIOSO SUPERVACUO and various NOBLES and HENCHMEN
(including the DUKE’s DRIVER) come in and find LUSSURIOSO
leaning over the body of his Father which is laid out on a
funeral pyre in this vast room

LUSSURIOSO
Oh villain Oh rogue Oh slave Oh rascal

NESSIO
Reverend majesty

LUSSURIOSO
The Duke my father - murdered

AMBITIOSO
Old Dad dead

LUSSURIOSO
Look his lips are gnawn with poison
Where be that slave that did affirm to us
My lord the Duke was privately rid forth

DRIVER
Oh pardon me my lords he gave that charge
Upon my life if he were by the Duchess
miss’d at court
To answer so He was with a lady

LUSSURIOSO
Oh heavens that false charge was his death
Impudent beggar durst you to our face
Maintain such a false answer Bear her straight
fo execution

DRIVER
My lord

LUSSURIOSO
Urge me no more
In this the excuse may be call’d half the
murther

VINDICI (0S)
You’ve sentenced well

LUSSURIOSO
Away see it be done

As the DRIVER is dragged out VINDICI comes in

SORDIDO - in tailcoat and white tie - comes toadying forward
to LUSSURIOSO followed by NESSIO ‘in a kilt

SORDIDO
My lord we’re something bold to know our
duty
Your father’s accidentally departed
The titles that were due to him meet you

The ghost of a smile flickers over LUSSURIOSO’s face
But then he recomposes himself

LUSSURIOSO
Meet me I’m not at leisure my good lord
I’ve many griefs to dispatch out a’ th’ way
(ASIDE) Welcome sweet titles
(ALOUD) Talk to me my lords
Of sepulchers and mighty emperors’ bones
That’s thought for me

NESSIO
My lord it is your shine must comfort us

LUSSURIOSO
Alas I shine in tears like the sun in April

NESSIO
You’re now my lord’s grace

There’s a general scramble to get down on one knee before the
‘new DUKE LUSSURIOSO meanwhile seems to grow physically like
a bull frog about to croak

LUSSURIOSO
My lord’s grace I perceive you’1ll have it so

SORDIDO
‘Tis but ‘your own

LUSSURIOSO
Then heavens give me grace to be so

VINDICI
He prays well for himself

LUSSURIOSO sweeps past all the bowing and scraping NOBLES puts
his hand upon VINDICI’s head and raises him up

LUSSURIOSO
In the mean season
Let us bethink the latest funeral honours
Due to the Duke’s cold body and withal
Calling to memory our new happiness
Spread in his royal son lords gentlemen
Prepare for revels

There’s a general murmur of approval at this idea Everyone
gets to their feet and we hear the word ‘revels’ a lot as

people file out

NESSIO
Time hath several falls
Griefs lift up joys feasts put down funerals

They all file out and we’re left with the lonely broken corpse
of the DUKE

‘ s Hall - id

The NOBLES HENCHMEN AMBITIOSO VINDICI and LUSSURIOSO are
moving down the corridor discussing the revels what they’re
going to wear where to have them etc

LUSSURIOSO pulls VINDICI to one side

LUSSURIOSO
One thing That girl Castiza The one
I tried but failed to woo

VINDICI is cheerily unsuspicious

VINDICI
You’ll have no need of her now you are Duke
You can have any that you chose

LUSSURIOSO
I choose her And now I have no need to woo

Now I command
He’s very full of himself He sweeps on down the corridor
VINDICI on the other hand stays rooted to the spot He hadn’t

thought of this The whole party sweeps away leaving him
alone in the corridor

He looks back Behind him he can see the open door and in the
Great Hall the body of the murdered DUKE

What is he to do now

95 Int Hannah’s Day

CASTIZA comes in in her knife-throwing outfit She puts her
jacket on over it HANNAH is with her

CASTIZA
Well now I am content

HANNAH
Content to what

CASTIZA
To do as you have wish’d me
To prostitute my breast to the Duke’s son
And to put myself to common usury

HANNAH
Good child dear maid if there be any spark
Of heavenly intellectual fire within thee
Oh let my breath revive it to a flame
Put not all out with woman’s wilful follies
I am recover’d of that foul disease
That haunts too many mothers Kind forgive me
Make me not sick in health if then
My words prevail’d when they were wickedness
How much more now when they are just and
good

CASTIZA
I wonder what you mean Are not you she
For whose infect persuasions I could scarce
Kneel out my prayers

HANNAH
‘Tis unfruitful held tedious to repeat what’s
past
I’m now your present mother

CASTIZA
Push now ‘tis too late Now he is the Duke

HIPPOLITO - the knife thrower comes in

HIPPOLITO
We must to the Revels

She goes to go then turns suddenly to her Mother

CASTIZA
Oh mother let me twine about your neck
And kiss you till my soul melt on your lips
I did this but to try you

And before her Mother can reply she’s gone

95a Night Sky

The inauspicious COMET fills the frame

96 Int Nightclub Night

The club accomodates the few GUESTS almost all of them WOMEN

ANTONIO and his HENCHMEN occupy a booth

COME IN ON LUSSURIOSO who is upstairs with his hangers-on -
VINDICI SUPERVACUO and AMBITIOSO He is signing a document
ready to join the throng

LUSSURIOSO
Is she here

VINDICI
She comes my lord

We see who he is talking about - CASTIZA She has just arrived
with HIPPOLITO They are setting up for their knife throwing

LUSSURIOSO
She will come certainly I’11 see to that

He thinks this is hilarious It makes VINDICI feel ill

PICK UP ON CASTIZA
She is watching LUSSURIOSO discreetly

He grins down at her She busies herself with the
preparations

PICK UP ON LUSSURIOSO

He has finished with the document now He folds it Sees one
of his HENCHMEN reading the Echo with the COMET on the cover
He grabs the paper gives it to another HENCHMAN to tear up

LUSSURIOSO
I am not pleas’d at that ill-knotted fire
That bushing flaring star Am not I Duke
They say whom art and learning weds
When stars wear locks they threaten great
men’s heads

SORDIDO
May it please your grace
It shows great anger

LUSSURIOSO
That does not please our grace

SUPERVACUO
Yet here’s the comfort my lord many times
When it seems most it threatens fardest off

LUSSURIOSO
Faith and I think so too Here Take this
I will begin my Dukedom with my Mother’s
banishment

The HENCHMAN takes the letter and runs off with it LUSSURIOSO
heads downstairs to join the party

PICK UP ON CASTIZA AND HIPPOLITIO watching him HIPPOLITO can
see from the look in CASTIZA’s eye what she is thinking

HIPPOLITO
Then you’re resolved to with the new Duke

A grim look settles on CASTIZA’s face

HIPPOLITO
Castiza avirgin honour is a crystal tower
Which being weak is guarded with good spirits
Until she basely yields no ill inherits

07 ightclut Ligh

We’re round the back where the big bins are The HENCHMAN with
the letter throws the DUTCHESS out He tries to read to her
the terms of her banishment
HENCHMAN
(reading)
Know that as I am now at last come to
be the Duke etc

We can’t hear much of what he says as the DUCHESS keeps bawling
obscenities at him

ANGLE ON SPURIO watching Only he seems to be upset

ANGLE ON AMBITIOSO eyeing the COMET

of ightelut ial

LUSSURIOSO is mingling He glances up anxiously as AMBITIOSO
comes back in”

LUSSURIOSO
Is it still there that fiery thing

AMBITIOSO nods

NESSIO
(quoting Shakespeare)
When beggars die there are no comets seen

AMBITIOSO
My lord
You’re gracefully establish’d with the loves
Of all your subjects and for natural death
I hope it will be threescore years acoming

LUSSURIOSO
frue No more but threescore years

SUPERVACUO
Fourscore I hope my lord

NESSIO
And fivescore I

VINDICI
I hope my lord that you shall never die

LUSSURIOSO

Give me thy hand these others I rebuke
He that hopes so is fittest for a Duke
Thou shalt sit next me take your places
lords
We’re ready now for sports let ‘em set on

(to the COMET)
You thing we shall forget you quite anon

There’s a fanfare A spotlight falls on the paraphernalia of
the knife-throwing act

A blast of music CASTIZA and HIPPOLITO make their entrance

While all this is going on we pick up on AMBITIOSO whispering
to SUPERVACUO

AMBITIOSO
Our brother shall not live his hair shall
not grow much longer in this time of revels
tricks may be set afoot Seest thou yon new
moon It shall out-live the new Duke by much
this hand shall dispossess him then were
mighty ‘
A masque is treason’s license that build
upon
‘Tis murder’s best face when a vizard’s on

He moves off SUPERVACUO speaks to himself

SUPERVACUO
Is’t so ‘Tis very good
And do you think to be Duke then kind

brother
I’ll see fair play drop one and there lies

tother

PICK UP ON LUSSURIOSO apparently enjoying the build-up to the
knife-throwing act He has also however spotted his brothers

plotting
LUSSURIOSO
Ah ‘tis well

(ASIDE)
Brothers and bastard you dance next in hell

HIPPOLITO hurls flaming knives at CASTIZA She stands smiling
then walks out of the silhouette of flame and steel he’s made

and takes her bow

CASTIZA
A volunteer Who’ll be our volunteer

Most people hesitate VINDICI looks curious He’s not seen
this before He steps forward but his sister waves him back

She looks flirtingly at LUSSURIOSO who comes over all
schoolboyish He’s clearly still obsessed with CASTIZA

His BODYGUARDS try to prevent him but he’s completely driven

by appetite to please her He jumps down and gropes her as she
leads him over to the board She gives him a flirty kiss on
the nose

VINDICI is revolted
She goes to her mark and takes the knives from HIPPOLITO

She throws one It misses A cheer goes up which LUSSURIOSO
acknowledges for his own Another Another miss Another

cheer

Suddenly there’s another crash of THUNDER and LIGHTNING and
as before the lights go out

There’s a moment of consternation and confusion

VINDICI
Pistols Treason Help Guards

GUARDS hurry to restrain CASTIZA on the grounds that she is
armed

VINDICI
My Lord the Duke

He runs as if to free LUSSURIOSO shouting -

VINDICI
Alas the Duke is murderd

LUSSURIOSO
No I’m not Oh Oh

But VINDICI plunges his knife into his breast

The lights come up and everyone sees the dagger piercing
LUSSURIOSO’s heart He hangs from the target

AMBITIOSO
How now Murdered

SUPERVACUO
Murdered

VINDICI
Surgeons Surgeons

VINDICI makes as if to aid LUSSURIOSO lifts him down

VINDICI
How fares my lord

LUSSURIOSO

Farewell to all
He that climbs highest has the greatest fall

My tongue is out of office

VINDICI
Air gentlemen air
(WHISPERING)
Now thou’lt not prate on’t ‘twas Vindici

murdered thee

LUSSURIOSO
Which one is he
VINDICI
Me
LUSSURIOSO
ra Aiiee
ae
VINDICI
Tell nobody

Under cover of mopping the wound with a handkerchief VINDICI
slides a little stilleto into LUSSURIOSO’s side

LUSSURIOSO expires

SPURIO
Whose groan was that

VINDICI
(CRIES OUT)
Great Heaven the Duke’s departed

(WHISPERING)
That’s thee and thy Father to my account

AMBITIOSO
Here’s a labour savd
I thought to have sped him ’Sblood
how came this

SUPERVACUO
Then I proclaim myself now I am Duke

AMBITIOSO
Thou Duke Brother thou liest

He pulls out a gun and shoots SUPERVACUO

SPURIO - surrounded by GUARDS - sees what’s going on and
produces a gun from down his sock

SPURIO
Slave so dost thou

He shoots AMBITIOSO

One of AMBITIOSO’S HENCHMEN spots this and looks to ANTONIO
ANTONIO nods at him

AMBITIOSO’S HENCHMAN
Base villain hast thou slain my lord and
master

He shoots SPURIO

ANTONIO summons his men

This seems like chaos but we notice that ANTONIO’S HENCHMEN
are incredibly proficient at protecting and covering him

ANTONIO
A piteous tragedy able to make
An old man’s eyes bloodshot

HIPPOLITO VINDICI and CARLO all rush to protect CASTIZA
ANTONIO intervenes on the girl’s behalf

ANTONIO
Unhand her there

Suddenly the night is filled with the sound of sirens
Police burst in

VINDICI
(GLEEFUL ASIDE)
Most fitting revels

PICK UP ON VINDICI helping CASTIZA and HIPPOLITO escape through
one of the little doors that lead to the stacks

As they hurry away VINDICI notices that HIPPOLITO has dropped
a little GUN He pockets it for himself

PICK UP ON VINDICI talking to a COP with AMBITIOSO’S HENCHMAN

VINDICI
This one killed all these

HENCHMAN
None but Spurio I And maybe Supervacuo
It was a girl killed the Duke

ANTONIO
It was a deadly hand that wounded him

The rest ambitious who should rule and sway
After his death were so made all away

99 Int St George’s Hall Day
LUSSURIOSO is laid on the PYRE next to his Father
The other BROTHERS are also piled on the BONFIRE

As it is set alight (99A) the MORGUE ATTENDANT notices
something sticking out of LUSSURIOSO’s side He points it out
to an important-looking COP

It is the knife with which VINDICI stabbed the DUKE

100 Ext Everywhere Day
Church bells ring out

All over the city the huge posters of the old DUKE with Arthur
Askey are being torn down and replaced by posters of ANTONIO
with IMOGEN

Also big saintly iconic images of IMOGEN

Lo icipal Offi
A wood-pannelled civic-looking office
ANTONIO sits behind a big desk in his chains of office

CARLO sits on a big leather chair nearby with HANNAH and
CASTIZA beside him Also present are NOBLES HENCHMEN and the

important-looking COP

VINDICI stands with his kit bag over his shoulder once more
ready to move on

There’s a genteel relaxed atmosphere A new regime’s first
moment of power

Outside the window someone is erecting a huge poster of IMOGEN

CARLO
Now all our hope lies in your reverend years
Your hair will make the silver age again
When there was fewer but more honest men
MES

Ko

ANTONIO
The burden’s weighty and will press age down
May I so rule that heaven may keep the crown

VINDICI
The rapes of your good lady and of mine
have been quitted
With death on death My work is done

ANTONIO
Here’s payment and God speed

He hands VINDICI a payment CASTIZA gets up and kisses her
prother as he turns towards the door

CASTIZA
Will you not stay

VINDICI shakes his head in a sad manly Western type of way
He heads for the door ANTONIO calls him back

ANTONIO
Yet stay a minute longer
Of all things it puts me most to wonder
How the old Duke came murd’red

CARLO
‘Twas all done for the best my lord I -

CARLO looks like he is about to claim credit for this murder
But VINDICI senses that there is danger in ANTONIO’s manner

VINDICI
All -for your grace’s good we may be bold
to speak it now
‘Twas somewhat witty carried tho’ I say it
‘Twas I who murd‘red him

ANTONIO
You

CARLO still acts as though owning up to this will help his
career VINDICI knows better

CARLO
We two

VINDICI
None else i’faith twas I alone If you
look into his ribs you’ll find my knife
It has a strange device upon the pommel

The COP produces it in one of those little legal freezer bags
they have for evidence VINDICI reaches for it

VINDICI
Thanks Officer I have sorely missed it

ANTONIO
Lay hands upon those villains

Everyone freezes

VINDICI
‘Twas I alone These others knew nothing of it

ANTONIO
Bear ‘em to speedy execution

HANNAH and CASTIZA scream their grief

CARLO

Heart was’t not for your good my lord
ANTONIO

My good
CARLO

You should be offering us land and titles -

ANTONIO
Away with ’em Such an old man as he
You that would murder him would murder me

GUARDS come running in But before they get to CARLO or
VINDICI VINDICI reaches inside his jacket and produces the gun
he took from the ship He points it at the DUKE at point blank

range

GUARDS

Look to the Duke
VINDICI
Get back

And they do fall back CARLO joins VINDICI taking DUKE
ANTONIO by the arms

VINDICI
Is’t come about

CARLO
‘Sfoot brother you begun

They start to lead ANTONIO out down the great sweeping central
staircase

VINDICI
May not we set as well as the Duke’s son
Thou hast no conscience are we not reveng’d
Is there one enemy left alive amongst those
‘Tis time to die when we are ourselves our foes
When murderers shut deeds close this curse does
seal ‘em
If none disclose ‘em we ourselves reveal ‘em

CARLO
This murder might have slept in tongueless
brass
But for ourselves and the world died an ass

They are half way down the stairs with the BODYGUARDS
retreating ahead of them totally outfoxed

VINDICI
And now my lord since we are in forever
This work was ours which else might have been
slipp’d --
And if we list we could have nobles clipp’d
And go for less than beggars but we hate
To bleed so cowardly

CARLO

We have enough i’faith
We’re well our mother turn’d our sister true

As they come round the corner of the stairs they see
immediately before them a phalanx of ARMED COPS

There is no way out
CARLO grins at DUKE ANTONIO
VINDICI makes ready with the pistol

VINDICI
We die after a nest of Dukes

VINDICI pulls the trigger Instead of a bullet out pops the
little flag with the word “Bang written on it

VINDICI curses looks at CARLO

VINDICI
Adieu

There’s a hail of bullets and the screen goes black

THE END
