SECOND DRAFT

DECEMBER 12 1994

FADE IN

A PAIR OF HANDS

mens hands nicely groomed hold a small white terry
towel spoiled by blood-red spots The hands rinse the
towel in a copper bar sink The stains soften but stay
A tan jacket sleeve spotted the same way moves INTO
FRAM The hands dab the wet towel at the spots with no
more success and throw it into the sink It falls half
in still dripping the stains a drop at a time to the
floor

ALL IN CLOSEUP
The owner of the hands walks to a wine rack opens a
bottle of white wine drizzles the wine on the jacket
sleeve The stains disappear He hangs his jacket ona
hook and walks from

THE CELLAR
and up the narrow stairs His FOOTFALLS ECHO against the
unadorned cement block walls We see his shape mid-
forties powerful his shirt pulled out Hes carrying
the open bottle by the neck

2 INT WINE STORE - NIGHT

Still seen from behind the man emerges from the cellar
into a contrastingly elegant space with a wood-beamed
ceiling vaguely European He walks along a narrow aisle
of wooden diamond bins As the space widens his foot hits
something in his path He bends to find a shoe He
glances about nervously There are shutters on the
storefront windows Shoe in hand he tightens the
shutters We see his profile a good-looking man

He walks toward a brighter room at the back of the store
the Tasting Room Now he retrieves a pair of womens
trousers from the floor and as he straightens up we see
his entire face genial venial redeemed by his smile
ALEX GATES He speaks nonchalantly toward the room

ALEX
Twenty people tonight I gota
South Beach widow a plastic surgeon --
they actually came together

(A BEAT)
These people -- all they really want
is something to brag about at dinner

parties

He swigs from the bottle of white wine grimaces detours
behind the counter and spits the mouthful into the
plastic lined wastebasket He throws the bottle away

Theres a basket of baguettes on the counter Alex breaks
off an end and chews it to rid his mouth of the taste of
the wine Still chewing he walks toward the tasting
room

ALEX
There I was passing the wine
passing the bread I suddenly felt
like the priest at Masst Or maybe
Mass started out as a wine tasting
and Jesus was a salesman what do
you think
He goes into

THE TASTING ROOM
It seems empty except for a large wooden table folding
chairs in disarray open bottles clustered at one end of
the table A chalkboard on the wall has CHATEAU
BEYCHEVELLE written across it at the top vintages listed
underneath The womans voice that replies is
Gabriellas

GABRIELLA (0S)

(with a throaty laugh)

Maybe I should get dressed

Leaning against the corner is a woman wearing only her
panties and a shirt In her mid-twenties she has striking
South American looks GABRIELLA VASQUEZ Shes sipping
red wine from a plastic glass

GABRIETM
I dont want to spoil a religious
experience

ALEX

-- Ever heard of Georges Duboeuf
He throws away some of the glasses

ALEX
Duboeuf has a nose and a palate --
like a gift from God He can taste
a single grape before the harvest
and describe the beaujolais its
going to produce
She laughs

GABRIELLA
Oh you have competition

2 ALEX

(SLIGHTLY ANNOYED)
You know how many bottles I have in
this store Open any one of

the floor He doesnt see her slip off her panties

She whips them over his eyes He laughs

her breast to the glass and then to his mouth

GABRIELLA

A middle-aged man a REPO MAN calls out lazily from
behind the wheel

REPO MAN

Alex buries the gun in the rear of his waistband as though
hes rubbing his stiff back and cranks his smile to a
higher wattage than the security lights

REPO MAN
I can collect either the money or
the car Given how much you owe I
figure its the car
The younger man has almost hacked through the chain

ALEX
Pop the trunk
REPO MAN
We inventory the property at the

yard
He keeps his eye on the chain ready to gun the engine as
soon as the exit is clear

ALEX
I just want to show you something
Worked by the combination of natural curiosity and Alexs
charm the repo man pops the trunk and gets out of the
still-running car

In his hand he has the locking Club Alex usually uses to
secure his steering wheel Hes not stupid Amused Alex
takes a step back palms up

YOUNG MAN
What are you doing
The repo man ignores him and looks in the trunk

ALEX

surprisingly gentle His knee works her legs apart

So stake yourself to a life
together Give her what she needs --

(SEEING GABRIELLA
before Jason does)
-- Hi honey
Gabriella comes up onto deck She glances bewildered at
the ocean around them

GABRIELLA
Why are we --

JASON
-- Shut up Just shut up
She sits on the bench her face tight and angry

ALEX
Hes feeling like you let him down
-She gives Alex a look that silences him He reaches for
another donut The SOUNDS of the ENGINE and the HULL
hitting the waves substitute for conversation

215 EXT BOAT - DAY (LATER) -215
Jason finishes setting the lines

JASON
-- Okay Im ready to listen
He sits down beside a pole and looks over at Gabriella
who has put on a hat Shes staring out to sea

JASON

(TO GABRIELLA)
Alex wants to make me an offer
She gives no sign of having heard him

ALEX
Were giving you a hard choice
Gabby Two rich men
Gabriella swivels her head slowly

GABRIELLA
I dont want either one of you
A line quivers Jason reels in a little

JASON
Somethings going to bite just

ABOUT --

(his biceps tightening)

—-- now
And the bait is taken at the moment he said The line
reels out very very fast He lets the fish run with it
Gabriella has turned around to watch Now Jason reels in
a little making the line taut testing the weight
He yanks back The line rises from the ocean bringing to
the surface a big dark green fish

ALEX
Jesus What the hell is that

JASON
Hammerhead Young Male
Jason plays the shark until its close to the boat and
thrashing for its life Gabriellas scared

GABRIELLA
Help him Alex

ALEX
Id just get in his way
His hand comes to rest on her shoulder as Jason expertly
reels in the bucking hammerhead She shrugs away from his
hand Jason has hooked a ten-foot three-finned sea beast
with a spade-shaped head and black eyes on each side He
attaches the line to a winch and winds it up onto the
deck It twists wildly knocking things over until it
slows down and finally lies very still His chest heaving
with the effort Jason looks around Alex has disappeared
without either of them noticing

216 INT CABIN - DAY 216
Alex is searching frantically

JASON (0S)
No luck
Alex whirls around His gun materializes in his hand
Jason retreats a step

JASON
Is this your backup plan

ALEX
No
JASON

You want it so bad its yours
He pulls out the necklace and hurls it away from Alex

ALEX

(MOANING)
You little prick

217 INTEXT CABIN - THE NECKLACE

skitters along the deck The sharks body stops it from
dropping out the open gate in the transom

ALEX
scrambles toward the necklace

GABRIELLA
Dont let him have it Hell kill

USL
Jason grabs her-and holds her with both arms to keep her
from going any closer Alex turns his head puzzled
warned Too late The shark suddenly thrashes its jaws
snapping around him Gabriella screams with Alex He
FIRES his GUN over and over until its empty The shark
continues to tear at him

ALEX
Help me helpmel
Gabriella runs down into the cabin Much as he hates
Alex Jason cant let him die like this He charges
forward and straddles the shark jams the blade of his
knife into the primordial brain He twists the handle
once The shark dies instantly Trembling with
adrenalin Jason gets off its back With his elbows Alex
drags himself out of the jaws Hes badly mangled The
shark slowly changes color to a dull brown

ALEX
You knew it wasnt dead
Jason squats down beside him to access his injuries

JASON
Mom didnt take the necklace
did

217 217
Alex struggles to stay conscious

ALEX
Then you killed her yourself
Jason slowly nods

JASON
And you were in the car behind us
Gabriella drops down beside them She has a flare gun no
longer needed and sheets from the cabin to stop the
bleeding She starts to tear them up Shes crying
slightly

GABRIELLA
We were supposed to turn him ini I
didnt think you were going to kill
him
JASON
Well I didnt
Alex manages to laugh

ALEX
Jesus You set me up You had her
call me

(TO GABRIELLA)
Shit I believed you
Jason pushes to his feet and heads for the cockpit

JASON
Ill get on the radio
Gabriella wraps the strips of sheet tightly around whats
left of Alex to bandage She smears away the tears so she
can see and leaves blood tracked across her face She
looks down to see his bloody hand clutching the necklace
They look at each other

JASON
has the microphone in his hand Hes setting course
Gabriella appears behind him Shes holding the flare
gun She puts it back where she found it and steps
beside him and puts her arm around his waist He lays his
arm over her shoulders and holds her close while he uses
the radio

JASON

This is Hercules II calling the
Harbormaster

218 EXT BOAT - DAY
The boat heads back to port

219 EXT DOCK - DAY
At an unused pier Gabriella leans back against the line to

hold the boat in place Henry and Jason carry Alex off
the boat and lay him on the planks SIRENS can be faintly
heard Jason leaps back on the boat Henry pushes them
off

CLOSER ANGLE

HENRY
You cool

JASON
I will be

HENRY
See ya

He and Jason wave goodbye The boat moves out Henry is
left with Alex

ALEX
(weakly to Henry)
Whats your name

HENRY
No way --
ALEX
(still the salesman)
-- No listen listen -- this is

worth a fortune
(thrusting the necklace

TOWARD HIM)
Play the possibilities

HENRY
Yeah Good advice
And he walks away fast

ALEX
Wait dont go Come back here
Come on back

Henrys gone Alex rolls onto his belly and starts
dragging himself down the dock too much of an optimist to
give up hope in a hopeless situation
