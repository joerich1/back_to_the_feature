EXT MANHATTAN - LATE NIGHT
We pan across the city skyline a beautiful sight -- over
which we hear the CLACKING of computer keys
INT A CONFERENCE ROOM (RUTHERFORD STERN)
- LATE NIGHT

A wall of glass offers a letter-boxed view of a sleek
conference room Amber sconces illuminate an enormous table
empty save for and YOUNG MAN at the far end - a lonely figure
hunched over a laptop

Steadily tighten on JONATHAN MESSER (late 20s) trim build
of

numerous

not entirely at ease in a suit Likeable features suggest a
gentle intelligent demeanor

Grids of numbers from the laptop screen reflect off his
glasses Tired he rubs his eyes continues typing

INT RUTHERFORD STERN LAW OFFICES - LATE NIGHT

Briefcase in hand Jonathan walks a vacant corridor of empty
cubicles In a few offices lights are still on the figures
of YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN at work are blurred like photos out

focus behind the frosted-glass of closed doors

INT TIMES SQUARE SUBWAY STATION - LATE NIGHT

Waiting for his train Jonathan pauses at a news kiosk
JONATHAN

Do-you have tomorrows Times yet

The grizzled OLD MAN behind the counter doesnt look up

OLD MAN
It is tomorrow

JONATHAN

Right I forgot

The Old man grudgingly bends to cut the plastic on a fresh
stack of newspapers As he does Jonathan glances at

porn magazines on display Naked women smile back at him --

OLD MAN
Anything else

JONATHAN
Uh - no No thats it thanks

EXT BROOKLYN - LATE NIGHT
sound

first

(OS) Jonathan descends an above-ground subway stop Neighborhood
streets are vacant the clopping of his shoes the only

Jonathan turns a corner heads for a humble duplex the

floor marked by unlit neon FLEURS DE SOLANGE He ascends
the steps his keys out --

WOMANS VOICE
Jonathan

The voice from nowhere startles him - he spins to find
SOLANGE

a vibrant Haitian woman with a thick accent

standing in the doorway below bundled in a ski jacket

JONATHAN
Solange youre up so late

SOLANGE
So early Jonathan We open in one hour

(GRINS)
So tell me you have been out with a lady
friend oui

JONATHAN

(SMILES)
Je suis desole madame mais no

SOLANGE
But why else does a young man come home at
such an hour

JONATHAN
Just working late thats all

SOLANGE

Every night working late working late
(teasing him)

Ah you cant fool me You are Mister
Mischief maker - I know this You come by

(CONTD)

hangs

SOLANGE

later and pick out something for your lady
friend oui

INT JONATHANS APARTMENT - LATE NIGHT

Very modest Furnishings are nice but sparse Jonathan
his suit jacket in a closet of empty hangers

INT JONATHANS BEDROOM

Not much decoration other than a dated Jimmy Connors poster
and an old tennis trophy Jonathan lies in bed flipping
channels on a small TV Typical late night stuff
infommercials CNN a Brazilian soccer match Channel J
(public access) on which X-rated clips advertise phone sex
Jonathan lingers a moment on these explicit ads

- then clicks

back to the roaring soccer crowd He closes his eyes and
drifts off to the frenetic Portuguese of an unseen

announcer

INT RUTHERFORD STERN LAW OFFICES - COFFEE LOUNGE - MORNING
TWO CORPORATE LAWYERS are talking shop while pouring coffee
JONATHAN

Excuse me
Fixing his coffee Jonathan reaches past them They barely
give him a glance as they continue their conversation

LAWYER 1
So the Knicks win last night

LAWYER 2
Im pretty sure yeah

JONATHAN
Actually they lost by 4
Both pause turn to Jonathan Jonathan smiles awkwardly

JONATHAN
his

to

It was supposed to be a good game though

LAWYER 1

Oh

(back to Lawyer 2)

Hey so did you get a chance to look over
that memo from Watkins

INT RUTHERFORD STERN CORRIDORS - MORNING
Bustling - yet here too Jonathan is ignored as he carries
coffee past ASSISTANTS and LAWYERS talking shop He smiles

politely at those he passes few bother to smile in return

INT CONFERENCE ROOM - MORNING

Again Jonathan works alone at one end of the long table
rapidly typing eyes ping-ponging from files to laptop
beside him a meticulous arrangement of pastel-colored post-
its on which are scribbled various calculations He strikes
us as extremely good at his job tackling the overwhelming
array of numbers and data with methodical assurance

Taking a break he pauses to peer out the glass wall before
him Behind the glass employees pass like fish in a tank

INT MENS WASHROOM -- DAY

In a stall Jonathan is staring sleepily at patterns in the
stalls marble door -- when a sudden KNOCK-KNOCK on the
divider to his right startles him He peers down and over

expensive black wingtip shoes a Wall St Journal spread on
the floor Another KNOCK-KNOCK Confused Jonathan turns to
address the divider

JONATHAN
Yes
MALE VOICE

(OS)
Take a look at this
The voice sounds youthful energetic Its owner slides his
Journal along the floor halfway between the marble division
MALE VOICE
(OS)
The Japanese are developing a toilet that
can analyze your urine for glucose levels
kidney disease even cancer Theyre
referring to it as the super bowl
JONATHAN
That certainly is
- something
MALE VOICE (0S)
Of course if youve ever been to Japan
you know theyre nuts about their toilets
Im talking web sites symposiums
Jonathan chuckles
MALE VOICE
(OS)

You think Im kidding They have bowls
over there that cost more than a piano
What I want to know is how youre supposed
to retrieve this analysis - you know from
your super bowl

JONATHAN
Maybe theyre developing a fly with a
nursing degree A superfly

MALE VOICE
(OS)
(OS)

(OS)

door

(OS)

(LAUGHS)
Whos in there anyway

JONATHAN
Uh Jonathan Messer

MALE VOICE
Messer What department

JONATHAN

None Im from Worth and Berman Ive been

over here a few wee--

A FLUSH from the next stall cuts him off The sound of
zipping up of a belt buckled then of a stall door opening

MALE VOICE

So youre an accountant
Jonathan follows the FOOTSTEPS now addresses his stall

JONATHAN
Audit manager yeah

MALE VOICE (0S)

So hows it work Rutherford Stern hires
Worth and Berman to give their blessing to
our books and they send you

JONATHAN

MALE VOICE (0S)

JONATHAN
Well I didnt get your name for oneth--
The SOUND OF A FAUCET RUNNING drowns him out

MALE VOICE

ose

JONATHAN

Sorry - I didnt catch that
(gets no response)

Hello

MALE VOICE
(OS)
I said its Wyatt Wyatt Bose
Jonathan FLUSHES buckles his belt opens his stall door -
- only the mens room is now empty

COMPUVOICE
(SOUND ADVANCE)
Message-four Three-oh-eight-pee-em

INT CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

Alone again Jonathan listens to voice-mail on his cell
phone Wefind two more batteries sitting ready ina
charger

PETERSON
(OS)
Jonathan Chet Peterson Just wanted to-
confirm youre wrapping up over there at
Rutherford Stern because the controller at
Clancey has been on me to get someone in
there by Thursday I told him how
brilliant you are said youre the best
auditor weve got Anyway I forwarded you
some documentation
Jonathan clicks his mouse - to find 27
a-mails ending in
worthandbermancom He reaches for his palm pilot clicks ona
day planner stylus writes Clancey into next week Other
than places hell be working days-are-all entirely blank

INT CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT
Jonathan still working Only a few of the post-its now

remain
on the tabletop Yawning he glances at his watch -

MALE VOICE (OS)
1253

Startled Jonathan turns to a well-dressed young man in the

doorway - penetrating eyes playful smile

WYATT
Sorry if I scared you I was heading home
and saw the lights We met before in the
can

JONATHAN
Sure Its Wyatt right

WYATT BOSE nods as he steps into the room

very likeably on about him

WYATT
So do you normally work this late

JONATHAN

Pretty much Im supposed to be out of
here by tomorrow so Im just trying to
finish up What about you

WYATT

You kidding This is an early night Hard
to believe that once upona time a mans
success was measured by how little he had
to work You know in Sweden the average
worker gets 7 weeks a year vacation
(regards his stacked files)

Do-you like accounting

JONATHAN
Its all right if you enjoy working with
numbers Do you like being a lawyer

WYATT
Its all right If you enjoy working with

familiar voice

Theres something
assholes
Jonathan laughs glances at his monitor screen

WYATT
Well Im probably disturbing you -

JONATHAN
No - its okay Really

WYATT

So Worth and Berman huh Dont you have
to like be in Mensa to work there
Jonathan smiles shrugs modestly

WYATT
Been with them long

JONATHAN
Since my senior year of college They
subsidized my graduate degree

WYATT
Really So you were poor
Jonathan is given pause by the bluntness of the

s

JONATHAN

Well - I guess you could say that I was
raised by a single mother and she died
when I was nineteen so yeah It wasnt
so bad though Im sure a lot of people
have had it worse

WYATT
Not around here Practically every suit I
know is Harvard by way of Andover

JONATHAN
Are you

question
drifts

- you can

WYATT

Me Hell no Im Princeton By way of

Exeter

Jonathan laughs Wyatt smiles takes a few idle paces

WYATT
So Jonathan

(GRINS)
What do you say to a break

CUT TO

CLOSE ON A SCREENSAVER OF SWIMMING FISH Tilt up from
Jonathans laptop screen to Wyatt and Jonathan sitting on
top of the expensive conference-table passinga joint
staring out at the rain hammering the far windows

JONATHAN

(STONED)

-Its just sometimes I feel so - I dont
know - removed I mean I work for one of

the biggest accounting firms in the world
andtheres not so much as a desk there to

prove it Theyve decided all we need are

cell phones and laptops Messages are

voice-mailed documents e-mailed salarys

deposited online Chet Peterson my senior

manager I swear he wouldnt recognize me

if I was sitting in his chair

Jonathan pauses takes another drag train of thought

JONATHAN

I dont know I used to have friends
But its like Ive spent so much time
trying to prove myself working these
hours

only do it so long before

you look up and realize youve lost

JONATHAN
(CONTD)
everyone Just - fell out of touch With
everyone And I try to meet people at
work I do But its always the same To
the accounting staff Im a pain because
for two weeks they have to hold their
breath and hope I dont pick up on any of
their screw ups And to everyone else Im
just a temporary fixture so why bother
The truth is this is the first meaningful
conversation Ive had in I dont know how
long Its like if I disappeared tomorrow
m not sure anyone other than Solange
would even notice - shes my neighbor I
live on what must be the only block in
Brooklyn that still isnt hip

(EXHALES)

guess I just never counted-on the

isolation Its like sometimes I look

through that glass and I see life

literally passing me by

Jonathan stares out the glass wall in stoned silence

WYATT
Jonathan

JONATHAN
Yeah

WYATT

By the clock on the wall there Youve
just talked for
37 minutes straight
Wyatt looks at Jonathan -- and cracks up Jonathan
hesitates
then he too starts to laugh so now they cant stop their
laughter filling the expansive room -- until its drowned by
the SOUND ADVANCE OF POURING RAIN

EXT MIDTOWN - STREET - LATE NIGHT

Jonathan hurries in the cold rain for the Times Square
subway Hes just about to descend - when across

7th Avenue

he

can

narrow

he spots a beautiful YOUNG WOMAN in a camel hair coat
clutching a slim briefcase waiting to cross the street
Jonathan gazes at her almost gasping Shes surrounded by
pedestrians with umbrellas shes the only one without one
and shes DRENCHED But she seems content to entertain
herself drawing a pattern in the drops collecting on the
umbrella in front of her

Jonathan watches intrigued - and then the rumble of the
subway below reminds him hed better move

INT TIMES SQUARE SUBWAY STATION - LATE NIGHT

Jonathan stands in a long line to buy a Metrocard his
glasses steamed up He takes them off to wipe the lenses
JONATHANS POV the entire station is a blur all unfocused
muted colors no object discernible from another -

- until his glasses return his POV to immediate focus and

sees the same Young Woman inthe camelhair coat a pair of
dollar bills in her hand entering the station

Jonathan cant help but stare again Despite her business
attire theres an almost childlike lightness to her step
Jonathan notices her slim briefcase Beneath her hand he

make out the first letter of a monogram S

She checks out the long line for Metrocards considers
waiting then decides lifes too short She continues past
headed for the turnstiles

Jonathan continues to observe as she raises her briefcase
then proceeds to wriggle her slender frame through the

gap in the turnstile

A PANHANDLER on the other side watches her with amusement
Glancing up she catches his eye and blushes a mischievous
smile Once shes through she drops her money into his
collection - and slips out of view

ANGLE ON JONATHAN still stuck on line staring at the space
she vacated

INT SUBWAY PLATFORM -- SHORT TIME LATER
eve

her

n

I mean

Jonathan arrives as an N train pulls away the platform now
practically empty

Weary and still a bit stoned Jonathan peers sleepily into
the dark expanse of tunnel yawns -

And then he sees S is waiting on the same platform Ten
yards away He gazes at her Shes unwrapping some GUM He
watches as she puts a piece in her mouth

The sound of an ARRIVING N TRAIN S heads for it Jonathan
follows

The train halts The door before him is the last of its car
the door before her the first of the next

The doors open

II Ss a€¢ II

(turns to Jonathan)

Excuse me is this the train for canal

Street

It takes Jonathan a second just to find his voice Shes

more arresting up close

JONATHAN

Uh either one is

the N and the

R both stop there so you know either

way I mean this is the right train Yes

Sos Of

Thanks

S enters her car Jonathan wavers wants to follow into

car but doesnt have the nerve He enters a different car
INT SUBWAY CAR - LATER

Jonathans slumped against a window annoyed at himself for
not getting in her car
He

stumble

lurches

as

of

Wyatt

He can see S She sits in the other car chewing her gum
studies her hes absolutely knocked out by her

CONDUCTOR (0S)

Next stop Canal Street Canal is next

He sees S rising to join the small crowd gathering by a
door

Jonathan stands up - his last chance Determined he braces
himself and rises grasping his briefcase

The screeching of brakes as the train grinds into CANAL ST

STATION
A sudden JOLT of the braking traincauses Jonathan to

slightly and his briefcase BANGS against a seat and SNAPS
OPEN - contents tumbling out His cell phone hits the floor
Jonathan quickly bends for his phone - when the train

to a halt nearly knocking him over and sliding his cell
phone a few feet along the grimy floor

OS we hear the hiss of the doors opening as Jonathan grabs
for his phone a second before its stepped on He hurriedly
stuffs it in his pocket shoves his files and papers and
paraphernalia back into his briefcase and rises to his feet

- to find the doors closing and S gone

Devastated he hurries to a window searching the platform

the train begins to depart He can just glimpse the back

her camel hair coat as his car is sucked back into a tunnel
He stands helpless just shuts his eyes and lowers his head

INT RUTHERFORD STERN - COFFEE LOUNGE - MORNING

Jonathan is pouring coffee when he brightens on hearing
1 and 2
sociable
a

enter talking animatedly with Lawyers

Caught up in

telling his joke Wyatt doesnt seem to notice Jonathan
Only when the lawyers burst out laughing does Wyatt glance
up His eyes meet Jonathans Jonathan smiles in greeting -
but Wyatt just nods coolly returns to his fellow lawyers
Jonathans smile falters He exits wordlessly

INT RUTHERFORD STERN - DAY

Jonathan hands over files and CD-Roms to a less than

ASSISTANT CONTROLLER

JONATHAN
I guess thats it then Nice meeting you

ASSISTANT CONTROLLER
Uh huh
Jonathan turns to go takes two paces - then turns back

JONATHAN

Listen - could you point me toward Wyatt

Boses office

The Assistant Controller looks up in mild annoyance

JONATHAN
Wyatt Bose Hes an attorney here
She sighs put upon then slides out a desk drawer in which

laminated page of names and extensions is taped Jonathans
eyes follow her lazy finger down the list --

A GRUFF VOICE (0S)

Hey quit looking down her shirt

Jonathan instinctively leaps back from her desk turns to
find Wyatt grinning at him from down the corridor

WYATT
Leaving huh So where to next

(OS)

hall

back

ball

JONATHAN

Clancey Funds on Thursday Clute Nichols

after that

Wyatts about to reply - when ANOTHER LAWYER passes him in
the hall Wyatt taps the lawyers shoulder

WYATT

Hey wait up a sec

(smiles back)

Well good meeting you Jonathan

Wyatt turns and starts to walk off with the other lawyer
Jonathan bends for his briefcase -

WYATT

Wait so you have off tomorrow
Jonathan looks up to Wyatt smiling at him from down the

WYATT
You dont happen to have a decent
backhand do you

INT MANHATTAN RACKET CLUB - DAY

Beneath an enormous bubble dome Jonathan and Wyatt play
mixed doubles with two attractive YOUNG WOMEN (early 20s)
Between points we observe from Jonathans side of the net
Wyatt chatting up his partner The rapport between Jonathan
and his partner is markedly less comfortable he wipes his
brow smiles at her she forces a polite smile in return

SAME SCENE - LATER

A good rally underway Jonathan fires a backhand Wyatt
returns it with an audible grunt Jonathan snaps the ball
back to Wyatts partner - only Wyatt intercepts nailing it
back Jonathan returns it with equal force

A grin on Wyatts face as he savors the battle blasting

each ball The women step aside Jonathan lunges barely
managing to lob a return Sensing victory Wyatt raises his
racket and with a guttural bark mercilessly smashes the

Jonathan dives racket over-extended - and returns a
near perfect shot just over Wyatts head but it lands two
inches outside the opposite baseline

WYATT
laughter

Out

Jonathan curls forward gasping for air Silence - then
Wyatts SOLITARY APPLAUSE echoes in the humid space

WYATT
Commiserations Messer Good game
They shake hands at the net Jonathan is exhausted

WYATT

(WARMLY)

Develop akiller instinct and youll beat

the crap out of me

Jonathan turns to commiserate with his partner - but shes
already gone to join her friend Jonathan crashes out on the
court From his low angle he watches as Wyatt goes over to
the girls and says something that causes a burst of

The girls finally wave goodbye Wyatt hops over the net

WYATT

They asked if wed fancy a post-game
cocktail Dont worry I got us out of it
Jonathan is barely able to speak

JONATHAN
Oh I wouldve been happy to

WYATT

Are you kidding Theyre a couple of first

years at Merrill Screw that we can do

better Hey you OK

Jonathan nods as an amused Wyatt helps him to his feet

INT RACKET CLUB LOUNGE

Soft jazz plays as Wyatt leads Jonathan past the bar area
Wyatt is admiring Jonathans weathered tennis racket
WYATT

Man I remember when these first came out
I think I was a frosh at boarding school
(chuckles fingers a string)

Jeez are these strings natural gut

JONATHAN

Actually its a hybrid weave natural gut
and Kevlar Theyre pretty obscure now I

should replace them theyre all frayed

Looking up Jonathan abruptly slows his pace his eyes
suddenly fixed on a woman sitting at the far end of the bar
From behind it looks remarkably like S

Only as she turns her profile proves otherwise

INT LOCKER ROOK

Wyatt and Jonathan in towels heading for the showers
Jonathan still deep in the S moment -

WYATT
Have you ever considered contacts
Jonathan halts confused to find Wyatt studying his face

his eyeglasses in particular

JONATHAN
Huh Oh - yeah I tried once but I was
allergic to something in the solution

WYATT

Too bad You have an attractive face Your
eyes especially

Jonathan looks self-conscious in his towel

WYATT
Its not a come on just an observation
(considers him a beat)
You dont get much do you

JONATHAN
What - you mean sex

WYATT
No flood insurance How many women have
you slept with

JONATHAN
Oh I dont know not a whole-

WYATT
Of course you know Everyone knows

JONATHAN
Maybe - four

WYATT
Maybe four

JONATHAN
Okay fine just four What about you

WYATT
Me I have no idea

JONATHAN
What You just said everyone -

WYATT
I meant everyone like you
Confused Jonathan looks up -- as Wyatt disappears into a

shower stall

SAME - MOMENTS LATER
Jonathan emerges freshly showered a towel around his waist
as he walks toward the rows of lockers

WYATT
(OS)
Tonight Fine Im on the list
Jonathan finds Wyatt half-dressed seated on a bench by a
locker and talking on his cell phone

WYATT
There better be
Wyatt hangs up looks up to find Jonathan staring puzzled

WYATT

Something wrong

Jonathan reaches into his locker for his hanging jacket and
pulls out his own cell phone Its identical to Wyatts

JONATHAN
We have the same phone

WYATT
Oh - and you thought I was using yours
I can afford my own phone calls you know

JONATHAN
No I wasnt
-- of course you can-

WYATT

Im pulling your dick Jonathan

(grins slams his locker)

Actually I was just firming up some plans
for tonight Are you free

JONATHAN

(SURPRISED)
Me Sure I guess
- but I dont want to

INTRUDE-

WYATT
Youre not What do you say are you in

JONATHAN
I guess I could go home and change

WYATT
To Brooklyn Forget it you can borrow
something of mine

INT WYATTS BUILDING - EARLY EVENING

A three-story brownstone in an expensive West Village
neighborhood As Wyatt leads Jonathan to the staircase they
pass a papery-faced GENTLEMAN

(50s) in a fine suit

WYATT
t
a uten Abend Herr Kleiner
(glances back)
This way Jonathan

INT WYATTS APARTMENT

Urban chic to a serious degree Big terrace funky

furniture

framed snapshots of Wyatt with similarly hip and attractive

young friends - and great art including an entrancing image

of a burning candle just slightly out of focus

WYATT

Like it Its a Gerhard Richter Kleiner

downstairs is a hot shot art dealer - he

hooked me up with the gallery in Munich

Wyatt disappears into the next room Alone Jonathan
wanders

pauses by the framed snapshots The young people in them are

like Wyatt -- beautiful strong wealthy Jonathan pauses by

one photo in which Wyatt looks a bit younger his hair

bleached blonde and loosely spiked

WYATT (0S)

Talk about a bad look

Startled Jonathan quickly turns to find Wyatt standing
right

behind him a slick expensive SUIT draped over his arm
witty too

WYATT

Here try this one

(off Jonathans hesitation)
What

JONATHAN
Nothing I just hope I can pull it off

WYATT
You hope you can pull it off You know who
you remind me of James Getz

JONATHAN
Who

WYATT
A guy I roomed with freshman year at
Princeton Real smart

when

you loosened him up Only from day one he
just didnt fit in For starters he was
dirt poor But it wasnt that See there
was always this boundary - this wall -
between Getz and everyone else You could
argue we laid the foundation but he built
it Built it by believing the lie

JONATHAN

What lie

WYATT

That he was any different The clothes
the money the wry anecdotes - its all

one big masquerade Anyone can get in
youve just got to wear a costume But
Getz never got that He assumed he could
never scale the wall when the truth is he
was the only one guarding it It never
occurred to him his anonymity could be an
asset No one gets over like the guy whos
just a face an impression We are - all
of us

only who were perceived to be

(EMCEE )

1920s

JONATHAN
So what happened to him

WYATT
Who James Getz Oh - he killed himself

JONATHAN

(hesitates a beat)

Youre pulling my dick arent you

Wyatt turns to him with a grave look then smirks

WYATT
With both hands
Jonathan cant help but laugh as Wyatt hands him the

CUT TO

in a vintage bowler hat

He struts up to us thumbs in his suspenders

INT THE VELVET ROPE - NIGHT

suit

An ultra-elite new burlesque nightclub in Manhattan

Parisian decor Strictly UPSCALE PATRONS male and female
sip from crystal barware while on stage a BETTY PAGE TYPE
performs an elegantly choreographed strip tease

Wyatt and Jonathan sit at a small table each table is
fitted

with an old-fashioned black rotary telephone as well as a

small monitor recessed into the tabletop on which old stag

films play silently All part of the wink-wink ambience

WYATT

Its a little self-conscious but I
thought youd get a kick out of it Hows
that suit working out

JONATHAN
Oh - great actually

WYATT
Keep it then Ive got two just like it
Jonathans about to protest when a WAITRESS arrives

WAITRESS
Two Macallan 25 year Enjoy gentlemen

JONATHAN
Isnt this like fifty bucks a glass

WYATT

Well try not to spill any

(regards the floor show)

So whats the wildest thing youve ever
done Sexually I mean

JONATHAN
The wildest thing Oh I dont know Ive
never been too adventuresome

WYATT
All right whats the lamest thing then
JONATHAN
The lamest
Wyatts focused on him amused eager to hear it

JONATHAN

Actually that was probably a few months
ago I was flipping through money magazine
and saw this small ad in the back It read
something like Are you feeling all alone
Looking to meet women but have forgotten
how And-there was this number

WYATT
And you called it So what happened

JONATHAN

Nothing actually The phone just kept

ringing And thats it

Wyatt stares at Jonathan a beat then starts to crack up

JONATHAN
Lame enough for you

WYATT

You called a sex ad - from Money Magazine

That is beyond lame

Jonathan too starts laughing - when the phone at their table
lightsup Wyatt looks to Jonathan raises a brow - then
picks up He listens a moment smiles hands it to Jonathan

JONATHAN

-Hello

Wyatt taps his shoulder directs his gaze to a SEXY BRUNETTE
at a distant table receiver to her ear eyeing Jonathan

JONATHAN
-All right Goodbye
Jonathan hangs up turns to Wyatt

JONATHAN
She wants to dance

proud

ON THE DANCE FLOOR - LATER

Jonathan is slow dancing with the sexy Brunette to an old
Edith Piaf ballad He looks over her shoulder to his table
where Wyatt is sitting talking on his cell phone

Glancing up Wyatts eyes meet Jonathans he flashes a

smile Jonathan continues dancing truly enjoying himself
The Brunette leans in whispers something in his ear

BACK TO WYATT AND JONATHANS TABLE
Wyatt clicks off his cell phone looks up to find Jonathan
returning alone looking deflated

JONATHAN
Shes a hooker
Wyatt shrugs grinning

JONATHAN
Hold on - you knew What - are all the
women here prostitutes

WYATT

That depends on what you mean by that
word Stretch the definition and you could
incorporate most of the men as well

(sips his drink)

You know in Amsterdam prostitutes not only
belong to a union they have to pay taxes

JONATHAN
You seem to possess quite a store of
international trivia

WYATT

Not really I just get around Jonathan
relax Its not like she just shot your
dog I was only trying to help Besides
what are you looking for - a relationship
As if you have time for one This was your
first day off in how long

JONATHAN
Three weeks

WYATT

Four for me Face it weve mortgaged our
youth Pimped out our twenties But we
still have needs And theres nothing
shameful about wanting them met

show

JONATHAN
So you sleep with hookers

WYATT

(LAUGHING)
Me Never

JONATHAN

So how do you - meet your needs

Wyatt studies him a beat another French love song drifting
in the background as the Emcee introduces a new girl

WYATT

What if I told you

(breaks off laughs)

Christ I sound like an infommercial

JONATHAN
What were you going to say

WYATT

Listen You dont think that women have
these same urges Young women just like
ourselves successful and working their
asses off to stay that way You better
believe they do

JONATHAN
And

WYATT
And - well - lets just say theres a
waya way it can be taken care of

JONATHAN
You make it sound like a mob hit
Wyatt smiles and turns his attention back to the floor
INT TAXI CAB - LATE NIGHT

Wyatt and Jonathan are in the back seat A quiet beat

JONATHAN

What you were talking about before
Peoples needs
Wyatt turns to Jonathan with a grin

WYATT
Some other time
(to Cabbie)

WYATT
(CONTD)
At the corner please The Rhiga Royal
(to Jonathan)
Listen I have to meet someone

JONATHAN

(SURPRISED)
Oh okay
The cab pulls up before the RHIGA ROYAL HOTEL

WYATT
Hey You had a good time tonight

JONATHAN
Yeah Yeah I did Thanks

WYATT
Im glad Listen that thing with the
hooker Im really sorry if I

JONATHAN
Forget it It was funny
Wyatt smiles warmly pats Jonathans shoulder

WYATT
Ill give you a call tomorrow
Wyatt

climbs out Jonathan watches through the cab window as

in

(50s)

Wyatt disappears into the golden glow of the lobby
LATER Driving in the cab Jonathan catches his reflection

the glass He smiles liking how he looks in Wyatts suit
Outside rainy Manhattan passes by ina hypnotic blur

JONATHAN

(To driver)

Hey Could you let me out at the next
corner over there on 7th Avenue

EXT TIMES SQUARE SUBWAY - LATER

Jonathan stands in the exact spot where he first saw S

He buys a New York Times and a hot-dog

Pedestrians and theatre crowds pass by as he remains rooted
to the spothoping hell see that face in the crowd

After a while he shakes his head at the ridiculousness of it
and heads down into the-subway

INT CLANCEY INVESTMENTS - A CONFERENCE ROOM - MORNING

Clanceys stiff CONTROLLER

hovers nervously over

Jonathan as he unloads files onto the huge conference table

Beside him we see hes set up his laptop phone charger

Jonathan is hunched over his laptop Like Rutherford Sterns
conference room this one too is designed with a glass wall
Jonathan peers out at workers passing in utter indifference
to him Slightly different tank slightly different fish

and non-negotiable Three no rough stuff -
the only rule thats even remotely
malleable provided theres mutual consent

starts to dance with her Hes self-conscious at first but
shes agile enough to guide him and soon hes into it

is S Il

See You just need the right partner

She closes her eyes swaying with the music They dance
together Hes falling even harder for her

As the song ends she holds his gaze -- when a small yawn
escapes her She covers her mouth

now still hasnt heard from her He lingers at the top of
the stairs not wanting to descend Below him he can hear

lonely roar of a train pulling in below
only when the train quiets down does Jonathan realize his
cell phone is ringing He picks up

JONATHAN

Hello

Intermittent static on the other end And then what sounds
like a WOMAN GASPING its unclear if its a sound of
pleasure or pain

JONATHAN

-Hello

The Gasping comes faster Jonathan debates hanging up - when
the gasps halt--replaced by the faintest whisp of a

voice No No please Theres no mistaking the tone

its fear - then suddenly a shrill terrified SCREAM
- and the line goes dead Jonathan stares breathlessly at

phone in his hand like hes just witnessed something awful
He quickly checks the display Number Unavailable
Jonathan looks panicked with the possibility that it was

- when the phone rings again He hesitates then picks up

Jonathan exhales in relief on hearing her voice

EXT CHINATOWN - CANAL STREET - NIGHT

Jonathan stands on a corner looking out of place amidst the

glistening neon and bustle of Asian faces He peers
anxiously

down thestreet checks his watch all anticipation

- when something is wrapped around his eyes Hes startled
tugs it off and spins to find S smiling back at him
if Ss Ill
I bought you a present
She drapes the scarf around his neck Its all striped
bright colors

- all the more funky against his dark suit

I knew it You look smashing

JONATHAN

Sure you dont mean clashing
She laughs
- then notices how tense he seems

Saez
Are you all right
JONATHAN
I guess I got a call-before yours
- Im
not sure if it was real or if it was even
meant for me - but there was a woman who
sounded like she was being - I dont know
hurt Maybe worse
S seems instantly on edge Something about this scares
her

If SIP
You dont know who she was
JONATHAN

(shakes his head)

It couldve been a prank

EXT CHINATOWN -- AN ALLEY -- NIGHT

A makeshift street market everything from fish and meat to
cheap electronics for sale in cramped stands Jonathan and
S walk arm in arm through the packed crowd like a couple
Jonathan looks like weve never seen him before a
fascination with everything around him especially her

They pause at a stall selling cheap trinkets including a
small metallic wind-up toy of a duck riding a bicycle

In between the mindless shtupping

JONATHAN
And sometimes during
She laughs The waiter brings them their drinks

JONATHAN

So how come you got involved in the club
She frowns slightly thinks

meet someone and not have to do the work
familyprevious relationships thing
Isnt who we are right now so much more
interesting than where weve come from

JONATHAN

Sure but that didnt really answer my

question

She reaches over and takes his hand holds it tenderly
a€z S of

I know it seems like Im holding out on
you but Im not Its just
- I turned
thirty this year and I made this vow to

He beams gazing at her Blushing she starts in on the
food

Outside we can hear rain starting to fall

EXT CHINATOWN RESTAURANT - LATER

Jonathan and S step out into pouring rain pause under the
shabby awning Waiters inside are putting chairs on tables
She fishes in her coat and pulls out a PACK OF GUM The
wrapper is entirely in Chinese She offers him a piece

JONATHAN
Oh - no thanks

JIS11

Dont let the wrapper intimidate you I

buy it at a store nearby It has ginseng

in it you know for energy Its not bad

though it sort of tastes like hairspray

She chews her gum He watches her the jaw line her lips

She looks at him and smiles but theres something behind
it

a sadness Almost an uneasiness

JONATHAN
Hey are you all right

SKEZ
I dont want to complicate your life

Too late

She gazes at him blinks back her emotions

She wipes the lenses then peering into his eyes slowly
leans in to return them to his face only she presses her
lips to his instead the glasses still in her hand the kiss

intensity of the kiss Embraced they accidentally step

breathless whisper)

JONATHAN

Maybe you should stay

She smiles as he kisses her even more passionately Again
they feel the awnings drops and Jonathan moves to shelter
them -

- only S leans into him instead leading him out from

the awning the falling rain suddenly drenching their faces
as they continue to kiss the moment purely exhilarating
wiping the rain from her face Jonathan gazes at her soaked
and utterly beautiful with something akin to awe - like

just breathed for the very first time
Rack focus on a hotel down the street its neon sign reads

Who could possibly judge them
They face each other breathing deeply almost panting

JONATHAN
And who would know
His face is inches from hers

- when she rolls over and

reaches for a glass of water on the night stand
She sips her water as she turns back to Jonathan Still
Jonathan picks up on her subtle shift

JONATHAN

and a key card from the table he surreptitiously adjusts
his

penis
(as one does) and goes to the door Hes about to turn

the handle when -

She hesitates a cryptic beat - then shakes her head and
smiles at him with immense tenderness Jonathan beams back
its Pl

He blows her a kiss she blows one back Almost in SLOW
MOTION She looks stunning

INT HALLWAY - LATE NIGHT

As Jonathan exits the room hold on the room number

Jonathan runs down the long corridor to the ice machine
Hes

giddy with excitement Passionately alive

At the ice machine an eccentric OLD WOMAN in her night

attire is slowly filling a bucket Piece by piece

Her weak gnarly hands plucking at the blocks not wanting to

break her long nails

Jonathan hops around in an agony of frustration

She turns looks him up and down - he feels a bit self-

conscious in his robe and bare feet

JONATHAN
Would you like some help maam

OLD WOMAN

I can manage thank you

Finally her bucket is full and she goes on her way
-Jonathan quickly fills his bucket with ice

Returning down the empty hall ice bucket in one hand key

JONATHAN

He tries the card again Leaning in he thinks he hears
something behind the door He peers down at the key panel
red

He knocks harder waits for a response None Dead silence

JONATHAN

Hello Hello

He jostles the door handle it wont budge Hes getting
anxious now his breath quickening He tries the key card
again red He pounds harder then slams his shoulder into
the door Nothing

Desperate he tries the key card again -- and the light

green

- A milliseconds surprised hesitation - then he jerks

the handle throws open the door and Jonathan tumbles into

THE ROOM

He peers up into the small entryway empty Ahead of him we
glimpse the foot of the bed its mussed blanket and sheets
Jonathan gets to his feet starts for the bed his breath
quickening as he now notices a few red specks on the

Panicked he rushes forward to find BLOOD soaking the bed
splattered all over the crumpled sheets

Jonathan gapes horrified the world crashing in on him just
as he senses something behind him and BANG

- something hits

him to the back of the head -- he goes down like a sack of
potatoes

INT HOTEL HALLWAY

Tripping over his own legs Jonathan runs barefoot down the
corridor He rounds a corner another stretch of narrow

He stumbles into the open square in which the elevators are
located He crushes the down button peers up to the floor
indicator overhead 4 slowly creeps to 3

INT STAIRWELL

His bare feet pounding the cement steps Jonathan takes each
floor faster sweat on his brow and his palms which slip
their grasp on the railing -- he tumbles head first

to the 2nd floor landing He clutches his head gets up and
continues to dash down

BANG of the stairwells exit as Jonathan stumbles out he
lurches forward finally looking up to find hes in

RUSSO

Mr Messer have you had - experiences

Jonathan keeps a quick pace feeling vulnerable

We lag back following him from an ANONYMOUS POV glance up
at a sign for stairs to the N and R trains

around still feeling watched -
When he sees a young woman standing all the way across on

Jonathan stands on the edge reeling desperate to getto
He looks around hears the distant nimble of afar off

and suddenly he does something wed have never thought him
capable of he jumps onto the tracks

He lands hard nearly breaking his ankle but quickly
scrambles to his feet splashing in the sludge between

eyes darting along the track anxious to avoid the third
rail ears attuned to the sound of that distant train as he
races for

THE CENTER DIVIDER
He reaches the grimy rungs and quickly climbs up
He gets to his feet on the center divider - now only one

of track separating him from the platform she was standing

- only shes no longer there
He scans the people waiting no sign of S among them - and
then suddenly he spots her heading for the exits

JONATHAN

STOP

She glances back utterly stunned to find Jonathan standing
on the center divider feet soaked in muck

Neither speaks for a moment just staring at each other
across the solitary track Then

JONATHAN

I thought you were dead

She looks like she wants to say something but doesnt And
all at once hes hit with a crushing realization

JONATHAN

You are in on this arent you

She holds his eyes a moment longer fighting back emotion -
then she abruptly turns and starts back for the exit again

JONATHAN

How do you know him

(off her silence)

Damn it answer me

She halts slowly looks back at him

Through the club He caught me trying to

steal his wallet

Jonathan looks confused shes struggling to stay composed
but looks like she could break down at any moment

He asked if I wanted to make some real
money All I had to do was get involved
with you and not ask any questions
Jonathan just stares devastated

JONATHAN
So everything between us - was nothing
She fights back tears

to call it off he said hed kill me if I
didnt go through with it

JONATHAN
Go through with what

The roar of the incoming train is growing LOUDER

- when the INCOMING TRAIN completely drowns him out and
swipes S out of Jonathans view

Jonathan struggles to peer through the train windows but its
passengers prevent him from getting a look at her Just then
the TRAIN DOORS OPEN WITH THE NOISE of passengers getting on
and off Panicked Jonathan cranes his neck trying to see
her through the windows

glimpse of her

hoping to conjure some kind of pattern or logic to it all
Reverse angle through the glass to anyone passing he looks
like your typical overly meticulous isolated auditor

away from utterly losing it -- when something suddenly

back up at him in scared but clear recognition

SAME SCENE - MOMENTS LATER

Seated on the edge of the made bed Black Business Suit
shifts uncomfortably as she lights a cigarette

BLACK BUSINESS SUIT

I was in Chicago on business a little
over a year ago I was outto dinner with
one of our Chicago partnersa man named
Holloway Thats how I met him

TIGHT ON JONATHAN as we SMASH TO

INT EXPENSIVE CHICAGO RESTAURANT - NIGHT

A slightly older man
sits with his back to us
Across from him sits Black Business Suit A YOUNGER MAN

into frame rests his hand on Holloways shoulder

At first I assumed he was a junior
executive at their firm But he wasnt
Thats not to say he didnt work for
Holloway but clearly in a more intimate
capacity

TNT THE MICHELANGELO - ROOM - NIGHT
Black Business Suit takes a cool drag on her cigarette

BLACK BUSINESS SUIT

I wasnt shocked Besides obviously Im
no prude Even back then Id been doing -
you know this thing -- for a while

INT EXPENSIVE CHICAGO RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Wyatt is talking entertaining his two companions - but

it

clearly more focused on Black Business Suit flirting it up

BLACK BUSINESS SUIT

I was simply curious More so when he
apologized explaining that hed forgotten

about another engagement

Wyatts knuckles just barely stroke Black Business Suits

thigh as he rises to leave They exchange a knowing
glance

BACK TO MICHELANGELO ROOM

BLACK BUSINESS SUIT

I was intrigued He was intelligent

informed about everything from law to art

to politics Id never met anyone so in
command of his own charm He said that

hed come from nothing that everything he
learned he learned from his tricks He
claimed that Holloway was even grooming

him for a position at his company

She lights another cigarette with her old one

BLACK BUSINESS SUIT

In a way I felt for him But I also

admired him It sounds silly but he had a

way of making me feel - close to him you

know

This clearly hits home with Jonathan He barely nods

BLACK BUSINESS SUIT
So I found myself telling him things
Personal things And next thing I knew -

JONATHAN
You told him About this
A beat and she nods crushing out her other cigarette

BLACK BUSINESS SUIT
He seemed fascinated by it Wanted to know
all the details
of

I suppose Id had too much to drink And I
was distracted I was thinking about
what a great lay he was going to be

INT FOUR SEASONS CHICAGO -SUITE BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT

Wyatt and Black Business Suit go at it with animal
aggression Shes on all fours arching lustily pleasure
nearly unbearable eyes clenched shut as she climaxes
Exhausted her body goes limp

TILT UP to his face an eerily blank driven stare devoid

real pleasure She struggles tries to protest - when his
hands grip her shoulder blades thrusting harder violently
pinning her down her sudden fear stifled by the mattress --

INT THE MICHELANGELO - ROOM - NIGHT
CLOSE ON Black Business Suit staring off chilled by memory

BLACK BUSINESS SUIT

Only afterwards I discovered two of my
credit cards were missing As was my cell
phone Of course I couldnt say anything
to Holloway And Jamie must have known Id
never report it to the police

(BEAT)

So I just put the incident out of my mind
I all but forgot about it until one
night maybe two months ago -

Black Business Suit is crossing the lobby for a portrait of
Hearst and A SUITED MAN lingering beneath it when the man

for

looks up Its Wyatt
BLACK BUSINESS SUIT

I almost didnt recognize him But when I

did I suddenly felt very very scared

She freezes -- obscured by one of the trees as Wyatt checks
his watch scans-the lobby with a cool piercing look

BACK TO BLACK BUSINESS SUIT AND JONATHAN IN THE MICHELANGELO

BLACK BUSINESS SUIT
I left before he saw me
She drags on her cigarette looks off into space

BLACK BUSINESS SUIT

He must have used my cell phone to get

into the group

(crushes out her cigarette)

Anyway thats it Thats all I know

She looks around At the room the bed She shudders rises

JONATHAN
Wait - thank you
(off her look)

Have you ever run into him again

Jonathan exhales about to log off - when a name among the
Hs jumps out at him Holloway Reed

Jonathan stares at it tensely - then clicks on the name
Sort no contact information available

Jonathan thinks a moment - then tries a search engine

Holloway Reed then decides to add the word missing

An article appears From the Chicago Tribune BODY OF

photograph shows a man in his early 40s whom we recognize
from Black Business Suits story Beneath his photo his

his nose smelling something He looks up two blocks away

thick plume of smoke is billowing up into the sky --
EXT JONATHANS DUPLEX

Jonathan bolts around the corner to find an ambulance and
fire engine curbside -- a fire raging in the lower story of
his building
Running toward the blaze he speeds past a BLACK BMW parked
across the street engine running It suddenly shifts into
gear and peels out in a fast turn Jonathan spins

- something
about it troubling him - but the BMW is already gone He
continues racing toward his building
The neon FLEURS DE SOLANGE sign crackles and sparks in the
flame Through blown out windows piles of burning flowers
emit what must be an awful stench

burned and half-aware but alive when Jonathan rushes over
She manages to open her eyes her voice barely audible

pops open his briefcase trying to decide what to take

He finds a file marked Bank Statements pulls it about to

Jonathan hunts through more files his breathless nausea
telling us the contents of each and every file have been

He opens another at random - and freezes its a photo of

He paces cautiously through the living room The dining

The glistening chrome and granite kitchen

THE BEDROOM
A room as empty as the others - with the exception of a

pile of envelopes beneath a window in a far corner Jonathan
slowly nearsto find its a stack of mail He picks up an
envelope -- OS the CREAK of a door hinge

Jonathan whips around -- no one behind him He steps out of
the room to investigate

We remain alone in the empty room an excruciating beat
-until Jonathan finally steps back in only slightly at
ease He returns to the stack of mail picks up an envelope
He reads Mr Jonathan Messer 140 E

Eyes wide he hurriedly flips through the rest of the mail -
all addressed to him at this address

Jonathan still staring at this mail in disbelief when he
finds at the bottom of the stack another PHOTOGRAPH Its

S standing fearfully on the subwa latform across the
track from Jonathan And suddenly Jonathan is gripped with
fear unaware of a blurred nearing intruder

WYATT
Long time no see

Jonathan spins round Wyatts standing there with a gun

pointing directly at Jonathan

WYATT

I might let her live

JONATHAN

Where is she

WYATT
This shouldve been simpler I frame you

JONATHAN
Where is she
A terrifying silence - Jonathan erupts

JONATHAN
Goddamn it tell me what you did to--

WYATT

A moment of tense silence
Jonathan just stares back hard a quiet beat then

JONATHAN
Whyd you pick me
Wyatt raises a brow vaguely amused the question

WYATT

(off Jonathans confusion)

Feeling all alone out there Have a great
job fine personality and good looks to

someone Help is just a phone call away -
JONATHAN

The ad - in Money magazine

WYATT

(GRINS)

Told you to block that Caller ID Of

losers before I hit the jackpot After

out there

(BEAT)

If you screw with me well - you saw what
I did to that Blonde Thats kindness
compared to what Ill do to your little

JONATHAN
Why should I believe you Everything you

WYATT

He grins his charming grin and starts for the door

WYATT

Remember be smart Ill be watching you

The front door slams Jonathan just stands there staring
shell-shocked at the envelope

EXT STREET - MINUTES LATER

Jonathan comes out the building putting the envelope in his

suit pocket

As he crosses the street a CAR HORN BLARES - WHIP AROUND to

find a car barrelling at us Jonathan dives out of the way
an

instant before the car would have hit him

Face first in the gutter scraped and gasping Jonathan
peers

Track around Peterson to see Jonathan seated across from

lifting his head to reply - and doing so revealing its

Wyatt wearing one of Jonathans suits hair colored and
styled like Jonathans even sporting identical eyeglasses
He offers an awkward half-smile just as Jonathan would

WYATT

glimpse an 8 digit code circled in pencil Jonathan stares
at

the cursoron the laptop screen the icon blinking

petulantly Hes about to type

And then he halts His eyes drifting to HIS CELL PHONE

resting in its charger

TIGHTER ON JONATHAN His eyes fixed on the cell phone an

idea forming in his mind --

RING of the cell phone suddenly jars us RING Jonathan

hesitates then picks up

WYATT (0S)
Whats taking you

Jonathan says nothing We can hear Wyatt getting tenser

WYATT (0S)
I said whats taking you

JONATHAN
I wondered if you were monitoring this

WYATT (0S)
Dont worry about what Im doing Just

JONATHAN

Not until I see her

(off Wyatts silence)

The transfers impossible without an

access code And theres no way Im

entering it until Im sure that shes

safe So you tell me How do we do that

Wyatt still remains unnervingly silent We tighten on
Jonathan holding his breath any plan hes concocting
clearly hinging on this

WYATT (0S)

(low frustrated)

You have a wireless connection
Jonathan lets out a brief exhalation

SAME - MOMENTS LATER

Jonathan snaps his laptop lid shut packs it in his gym bag

JONATHAN
Not until I see her Shes the only reason

WYATT
I told you shes in a room Alive

JONATHAN

Wyatt considers this then takes out an electronic key card
and slides it across the table Of course theres nothing on
the key card to indicate a room number

WYATT
As soon as youre done Ill tell you the
room number

JONATHAN

Not good enough

Wyatt reaches for the key card as he does we glimpse a
handgun concealed by his suit

JONATHAN
You wont let her live You killed all the
others youll have to kill us too

JONATHAN

every corner the bathroom the closets Everywhere

The sterile room taunts him - the uncreased bedspread the
neat arrangement of the complimentary stationary the
incessant moaning coming from the porn on the TV set --
Jonathan suddenly erupts grips the TV and shoves it off its
ledge It hits the floor with a crash and sudden silence
Jonathan rubs his brow heaving in desperation -- when his
eyes land on the sleek dark piece on which the TV was

resting its a dense rectangular block - only when

taps it he realizes its hollow

He immediately seizes it yanks it from the wall

And there she is lying face down in a lifeless heap S
Panicked Jonathan rushes to her turns her over She looks
semi-conscious hands and mouth duct-taped Jonathan
hurriedly removes the tape gently shakes her terrified by
how lifeless she appears -

- when her eyes widen focus on his face Before he can say
anything she throws her arms around his neck presses her
face to his chest
