Tomorrow in the shower Ill come up

they make me uncomfortable

NADINE
What Thats the worst analogy Ive
ever heard First of all my
brother isnt a scrumptious
chocolate snack and second how
can peanut butter cups make you
uncomfortable

(CONTTNURFD )

KRISTA
Lots of ways Maybe I have a peanut
allergy Maybe I just have
nightmares about them jumping down
my throat and clogging up my
arteries

NADINE

Thats crazy Theyre not even that
fatty Whatever you know what
fine I would I would never touch
another goddamn peanut butter cup
as long as I live just for you In
fact Id have them all put ona
big boat and dumped in the middle
of the ocean because thats just
how much of a good freaking friend
I am

KRISTA
That would do nothing That would
just kill a whole bunch of sea
life

NADINE
Id kill that sea life in the name
of our friendship Id murder fish
to make you happy

Krista rubs her temples sighs

KRISTA
He asked me to go lunch at Jack In

ERWIN
Oh I dont know Im just an
average guy I guess

NADINE
But if you had to expand for the
two minutes were on this ride

ERWIN
Well I guess I do kinda wish
people at school didnt just
automatically stereotype me as the
nerdy Asian kid Theres a lot
more to me than that and I feel
like if they could see it theyd
realize Im actually well kinda
cool even

NADINE
Yeah Like how

ERWIN
Im mean not to brag or sound
totally full of myself but for
instance Im a crazy talented
flautist

NADINE
As in you play the flute

ERWIN
Not just boring Mozart stuff I can
play anything I really jam on that
thing Not to brag

Another beat

NADINE
This is just a suggestion Erwin
but if the goal is to up your cool
factor Im not exactly sure
flautist is the best approach

Erwin shrugs Yeah maybe not

She sighs

ERWIN
How about you What do you want out
of life

looks off

(CONTTNURFD )

NADINE
I like animals a lot We dont
really have any except for a cat

out of bed for days

I dont know mom I just wanted
things to be like they were you
know When Darian came along it
just changed everything

MONA
Honey being friends would be easy
if everything always stayed the
same you always lived right down
the street from each other had the
same hobbies were single and not-
single at the same time But you
grow up and realize your lives
arent always going to intersect so
neatly Hell next year you two may
go off to different colleges
Couple years after that maybe
shes married with a baby while
youre out freaking some Italian
guy you just met at the club Do
they still call it freaking or is
that over now

NADINE
Pretty sure that ones done

MONA
You get my point though A lot of
friendships cant handle change
But the good ones they adjust
If you really care about each
other you find a way to make it
work

around Mona hugs her tight
