FADE IN
On complete darkness
A SMALL DOOR swings open

A circle of light reveals that we I re looking down the
length of a tube At the far end of the tube we see a
gloved hand dangling a rat The hand shoves the
frightened rat into the tube and closes the door behind
it The rats stark white fur bristles and it begins to
pad down the tubes length

After several feet the tube opens up into a dimly lit
cubicle The rat hesitates and stops

The SOUNDS of gentle BREATHING whispers in the rat s
ears

The rat turns round to head back down the tube but a
door swings shut trapping it in the cubicle

The rat cowers as the BREATHING turns to SNORTING

The rat s head jerks around looking for signs of danger
but the cubicle is empty The rat sees a water dish on
the far side of the cubicle - a place to hide - and
dashes toward it

But an invisible force descends

The rat squeals in agony as something smashes down on its
body crushing it

A LOUD BELLOW rings out and the rat flies into the air
halting a few feet off the ground Its body writhes
struggling against the unholy force

Then a sick crunch of tiny bones snapping All life
quickly drains from the levitating body Dead eyes
The creature s corpse floats in mid-air Then the white
fur of the rat explodes in a shower of blood

HUGE BLOOD SMEARED INCISORS appear as do the red-slicked
ape- like lips The gaping bloody mouth bites again into
the rat

INT BEDROOM - NIGHT
In the background we hear Jay Lenos monologue from the
Tonight Show A small lamp and the glow from a computer
screen illuminates SEBASTIAN CAINE late twenties with
the shabby good looks of a perpetual grad-student Wiry
framed and wearing only boxer shorts Sebastian sips
coffee from an Einstein coffee mug He peers at a
complex computer rendered molecule displayed on his
screen He pecks a few keys and the molecule shifts
slightly then falls apart

Sebastian pulls a twinkie from a hostess box unwraps the
cellophane and sucks it down He attacks the keyboard
with renewed vigor

Another molecule appears on the screen Sebastians
fingers fly across the keyboard The molecule blinks on
and off it trembles and twists apart

SEBASTIAN
Damnit

Sebastian pears out his window Across the courtyard a
light comes on in a neighboring window He sees a
BRUNETTE mid-twenties absolutely stunning enter her
living room The Brunette thumbs through the mail tosses
it and then begins to undress Sebastian loans over to
the window getting interested But when the brunette
reaches her bra and panties she crosses to the window
and lowers her shades

SEBASTIAN (cont d)
Damnit

Sebastian leans back in his chair and closes his eyes
Hes obviously tired He opens his eyes and stares up at
the ceiling Painted across the white matte finish in big
red letters is a brief reminder - You Should Be

Working Sebastian sighs leans forward and begins
pecking away again

LATER

The television is now only static We pan by his alarm
clock 4 am We find Sebastian pacing in front of his
computer

He gets an idea slides back in his chair Types away
again The molecule reforms on the computer screen

He types a few more keys waits watches the molecule
Nothing happens

He hits a few more keys and watches intently for a
reaction

SEBASTIAN
(beat)
I am a goddamn genius

He hits a few more keys and a telephone keypad appears on
the screen He dials

CUT TO
INT ANOTHER BEDROOM - NIGHT
Digital phone rings

In the bed LINDA FOSTER late twenties stirs froma
deep sleep As she straggles out of bed and over to her
desk we notice a young man sleeping next to her

The ringing continues She moves her computer mouse
around and her screen comes to life She click ona
telephone icon and the ringing stops A beat later
Sebastian appears in a window on her screen

LINDA
Sebastian do you know what time it
is

SEBASTIAN (SCREEN)
You know Da Vinci never slept Said it
was waste of time

LINDA
What is it this time

INTERCUT SEBASTIAN S BEDROOM

Sebastian peers at the image of Linda in the computer
window He notices something behind her in the bed the
young man sleeping face down

SEBASTIAN
Whos that

Linda pulls the camera off the top of the of the computer
screen and positions it so Sebastian can t see the bed

LINDA
Not your business Not anymore

SEBASTIAN
Touche

LINDA
So you calling about anything in
particular or were you just hoping to
catch me sleeping in the nude

SEBASTIAN
I cracked the reversion
Upon hearing this Linda receives a jolt of adrenaline

LINDA
You cracked it

SEBASTIAN
Look at this

Sebastian hits a couple of keys A moment later the
molecular structure appears on Lindas computer

SEBASTIAN
Watch this

LINDA
You sure

SEBASTIAN
91 sure

LINDA
(astonished)
Eleven months with no progress and you
suddenly come up with it out of the
blue How

SEBASTIAN
The usual Coffee and twinkies

LINDA
I hate you

SEBASTIAN
I know You think you could hunt down
Matt and get to the lab early I want
Isabelle prepped for a live test

LINDA
Yeah I think I can find him What are
you going to do

SEBASTIAN
Well y know Its daylight in
Switzerland I gotta call the Nobel
Committee and tell them to get our
prizes ready See you in a few

ON LINDA S COMPUTER SCREEN as Sebastian clicks off Linda
crosses to her bed and shakes the guy awake

LINDA
Hey come on

DR MATTHEW KENSINGTON late 20s too stirs from under
sheets

MATT
(groggy)

What
LINDA
Sebastian just called We gotta get to
the lab
Matt bolts up
MATT
Shit You didn t tell him I was here
did you
LINDA

Give me some credit will ya

MATT
So whats the rush

LINDA
He cracked reversion

Matt pulls his jeans on

MATT
Wanna ride down

LINDA
We better take our own cars

MATT
You re gonna have to tell him about us
eventually

LINDA
I know It s just You re his best
friend He 11 feel betrayed

EXT WASHINGTON DC SKYLINE - DAY

From a distance the Nation s Monuments stand awash in
the harsh light of morning

CAMERA finds a BLACK PORSCHE as it pulls to the security
fence of a warehouse The imposing structure is
surrounded by a chainlink fence and barbed wire

The Porsche is waved through security and heads straight
into the warehouse

INT WAREHOUSE -DAY

The Porsche pulls to a halt in a reserved parking space
and Sebastian exits wearing a Hawaiian shirt shorts
and Birkenstocks He notes the other cars parked in the
lot then crosses to bunker in the center of the
warehouse guarded by a MARINE shouldering an M-16
MARINE GUARD
Morning sir

SEBASTIAN
Morning Ed

MARINE GUARD
Your team s in early Something
special going on

SEBASTIAN
Sorry Ed You know the rules

Sebastian presses his thumb against a glass screen A
laser reads his print

Scan readout CAINE SEBASTIAN
Clearance ALPHA ALPHA THREE
Division CLASSIFIED

The doors whisk open and Sebastian steps inside

MARINE GUARD
Have a good day sir

INT ELEVATOR - DAY

Inside the elevator is a numberless keypad Sebastian
taps in his floor code

ELEVATOR (V0)
Authorization please

SEBASTIAN
Caine zero zero two seven

ELEVATOR (V0)
Authorization verified Good morning
Dr Caine

The elevator descends with a groaning hum It passes
below us and keeps descending into the belly of the
earth the shaft goes down forever

INT HABITAT S CORRIDOR

We slowly push down a hallway panelled by Plexiglas
chambers Each chamber looks as if its tailored for a
specific animal although no animals are visible

As we pass one habitat something slams into the
Plexiglas and begins barking Another HOWL joins in Then
SCREECHING Suddenly the hallway fills with a dozen
animal cries THUMP

THUMP

The Plexiglas on several chambers vibrates as if angry
animals were slamming against it But still no animals
are seen

Above each chamber VIDEO SCREENS display THERMAL IMAGES
revealing heat signatures of the various animals but
they remain invisible to the naked eye MATT taps on a
sheet of Plexiglas which seals off another seemingly
empty cage

MATT
Isabelle

The woodchips on the floor shift and suddenly the
Plexiglas steams up right in front of Matt s face The
Plexiglas begins to shake violently

MATT (cont d)
Calm down baby Calm down It s
okay

Matt takes a pair of thermal goggles from his belt and
pulls them down over his eyes

THERMAL POV - A rather large heat signature ape-like in
shape rattles about the cage Matt slowly unlatches the
Plexiglas door and reaches inside

MATT (cont d)
It s okay baby It s okay I m not
going to hurt you Come here

THERMAL POV - he reaches out to the creature He grabs
hold of it firmly Stroking it The creature COOS Matt
reaches for a hypo and brings it up to the creature

MATT (cont d)
Just hold still

Something clamps down on his hand breaking his skin
Blood erupts in a bite pattern

MATT (cont d)
Ow shit

Matt drops the hypo and falls back The cage door flies
open and something runs out Matt pulls himself up to see
the heat signature running down the hallway He turns
around to see another heat signature coming at him Matt
pulls off his goggles to see Linda coming up the
Corridor

LINDA
You okay

MATT
She bit me
LINDA
Yeah She s become a lot more
aggressive in the last few days

Linda takes the goggles from Matt

LINDA (cont d)
Go take care of that bite I 1l get

her

MATT
And give you a chance to pull ahead
Never

Linda opens a lock-box at the end of the hallway and
pulls out a two tranquilizer guns She hands one to Matt

AROUND THE CORNER

A slight distortion shimmers as something runs past us
We hear HOOTS and FOOTSTEPS

Looking down the shadowy corridor we hear grunting and a
haunting heavy breathing The control door is closed
though and something large and angry is throwing itself
against it We can t see anything

A few moments later Linda and Matt round the corner
wearing goggles and leveling their pistols

MATT
(ala Porky)
Shh Be vewy vewy quiet I m hunting
simians heheheheh
LINDA

Knock it off
(soothing voice)
Isabelle

THERMAL POV - Dark hallway Movement A red shimmering
heat signature It comes running at Linda HOWLING Linda
fires A T-DART flies Thwack It stops in mid-air
Then falls But it doesn t hit the floor Instead it
stops inches above the ground

THERMAL POV - the heat signature lies in a heap at
Linda s feet

MATT
Good shootin Tex

LINDA
What s that make it

MATT
Im still ahead 6 to 5
Like a smug gunfighter Linda blows imaginary smoke from
the top of her tranquilizer gun

LINDA
But I m catching up

INT CORRIDOR - DAY

The elevator doors open and Sebastian steps out He s met
by SARAH KENNEDY early thirties a fiery red-head

SARAH
Can I have a word

SEBASTIAN
Most normal people say good morning

SARAH
Don t you think you should test the
protocol on the liver samples before
you inject Isabelle

SEBASTIAN
How many tissue samples have we
successfully regressed Hundreds
right How many have gone on to work
on the full system None

SARAH
That s beside the point

SEBASTIAN
No that is the point I m not going
to waste six months of my life on an
outmoded testing procedure This thing
works I know it I feel it

Linda comes down the corridor listening in on the tail
end of the conversation

SARAH
Fine You can mop up afterward

SEBASTIAN
You think I m going to kill Isabelle

SARAH
Kill More like liquefy

SEBASTIAN
Sarah thank you for your opinion but
I m the project leader Understand

She says

SARAH
Yes Sir

but somehow it feels like Fuck you She storms off
Sebastian turns to Linda

SEBASTIAN
How did you ever convince me to hire
her

LINDA

You said you wanted the beat vet in
the country

SEBASTIAN
Yeah well she cares more about the
animals than the research

LINDA
Maybe that s why she s so good

CUT TO

CLOSE ON MATT as he shuts off the spinning cyclotron As
its spinning slows to a halt he pops the top and
reaches in removing

A GLOWING VIAL OF ORANGE LIQUID
Sebastian peers at the vial

SEBASTIAN
Who da Man You da Man

MATT
As we pull out we see we are

INT LABORATORY - DAY

Almost feels like a dungeon Think high-tech
Frankenstein Walls lined with video displays technical
readouts bizarre medical equipment

On a table in the middle of the room a sheet drapes over
a humanoid form strapped down at its invisible limbs
The straps move slightly ghostly Wires lead from the
body to lots of machinery

MATT
Protocol is hot

SEBASTIAN
Vitals

Sarah checks over the various readouts heartbeat
blood pressure the rest

SARAH
Normal

CARTER ABBEY the late thirties lab assistant wheels in
a cart of equipment Linda taken a seat by the table and
pushes aside the sheet

BOOMING VOICE
THIS IS GOD YOU ARE DISTURBING THE
NATURAL ORDER OF THINGS AND WILL BE
SEVERELY PUNISHED FOR ALL ETERNITY
GOD HAS SPOKEN

SEBASTIAN
How many times do I have to tell you
Frank you aren t God
(beat)
I am

FRANK (LOUDSPEAKER)
Sorry Boss Forgot

Sebastian glance up at a glass booth overlooking the
Laboratory floor TWO PEOPLE in the booth

SEBASTIAN
You guys ready to roll

INT OBSERVATION BOOTH

FRANK CHASE early thirties and tech expert JANICE
WALTON early twenties man a small booth above the lab
They re dressed more like band roadies than scientists
The room is crammed with electronic and recording
equipment A handful of monitors display different images
of the lab Thermal and regular video Another screen
monitors vital signs

FRANK
We are live and in color On your
mark

Frank and Janice looks down on their colleagues
Sebastian nods their way

SEBASTIAN
Okay Roll em

JANICE
Okay We are rolling record on videos

one through twelve

Frank hits a series of buttons and speaks into a
microphone Recording

INT LABORATORY - DAY

Frank s voice echoes through the chamber
FRANK (VO)
Subject Isabelle Two Currently in
phase shift one hundred twenty six
days eighteen hours

LINDA
Testing De-Phase protocol Injecting
serial protein Caine One Two Five

Linda removes a glowing vial of orange liquid from a
centrifuge nearby

MATT
Maybe if you stopped naming them after
yourself you d have better luck

SEBASTIAN
Why thank you Dr Kensington for
that keen scientific observation I 1l
be sure to include it in my memoirs

MATT
A whole mention And I thought I was
just gonna be a footnote

Matt unwraps a hypodermic needle and jabs the needle into
the vial drawing up the colored liquid

INT OBSERVATION BOOTH

MATT
Okay

Frank and Janice monitor Isabelle s vitals
INT LABORATORY - DAY
Tension in the air

SEBASTIAN
(to Linda)
Ready

She wraps a bungee cord around nothing and pulls it
tight She then takes some dye and sprays it A surface
appears floating beneath the restraints It sheens in
the light as Linda searches for a vein She slaps the
surface several times A small bulge appears like a
vein

LINDA
Propped

MATT
Let s make some history
Matt lowers the hypo to the vein But Sebastian takes the
hypo from Matt s hand

SEBASTIAN
Nice try Sparky

Matt relinquishes the needle

LINDA
Come on Isabelle You can do this

Sebastian lowers the hypo The skin bonds and gives The
needle remains in sight after it slips through the
visible surface Matt presses down on the hypo plunger
releasing a dye into his bloodstream The gold liquid
twists into a long snaking tube up and down the limb

It s the shape of a vein The liquid begins to react
Small flashes of light blip up and down the strand of
color Ba-bump ba-bump the heartbeat starts to speed
up

SARAH
Elevated heartbeat

INT OBSERVATION BOOTH
Janice analyzes the screens

JANICE
We re still in the green

FRANK
Confirmed Vitals still in the normal
range

INT LABORATORY

The glowing liquid turns from gold to red as the complex
webbing of a bloodstream appears

MATT
It s reacting

Spreading out from the bloodstream soon becomes
visible the shadow of a skeletal system

SEBASTIAN
Do you see this

LINDA
It s working It s actually working

Matt pulls the sheet back Muscles are beginning to
appear And eyeballs Frightened eyeballs

SARAH
Heart rate s up She s scared
Sarah soothes her

SARAH (cont d)
Its okay baby Its okay

SEBASTIAN
Subject began manifesting almost
Immediately Protocol is reacting
quickly

Isabelle starts to struggle against her restraints She
begins to howl

LINDA
Subject may be in pain or extreme
discomfort

SARAH
Goddamnit Blood pressure elevating
Brain activity going through the roof
The brain appears seemingly growing from the inside out
The shape of a large half-formed monkey grows from the

inside out A SKULL APPEARS howling in pain in horror

SARAH (cont d)
We ve got a problem

SEBASTIAN
What What problem

Sarah checks her monitors
SARAH
It s her heart We can see the heart

beating in the ape s

FRANK (V0)
I got an erratic heart beat

SARAH
She s going into cardiac arrest

LINDA
Got the crash cart

Carter charges the crash cart and rolls it in

SARAH
We re losing her

Her machine flatlines

SEBASTIAN
No It s got to work
The body is only half there It looks as if its caught in
decomposition Linda rubs the cardiac paddles together

LINDA
Clear

Linda slams the paddles on the monkey s chest The jolt
of electricity makes the monkey visible again for a brief
moment Then the skin and flesh fade away again

SARAH
We ve got something

The heartbeat starts up again The body continues its
march towardvisibility

SARAH (cont d)
Still erratic

LINDA
Come on Isabelle Come on You can do
it You can fucking do it

Everybody s pulling for her

SARAH
Come on monkey

MATT
Do it Do it Come on

Muscles spread like a rash on bone as the monkey twists
and turns frightened Then skin The monkey howls Skin
forms over the muscles reappearing like it was being
painted on before our eyes

SARAH
Stabilizing

The entire form glows then blinks then glows again as
if it was discharging some stored energy

FRANK (V0)
Brain activity returning to normal

The monkey grunts and groans Blinks its eyes Linda
hovers over it stroking its fur

LINDA
Welcome back Isabelle

Sebastian puts his hand on Linda s shoulder a move
that does not go unnoticed by Matt We did it

SEBASTIAN
(beat)
How is she
TO

SARAH
(surprised)
I think she s gonna be okay

INT HABITAT

Frank Matt Sarah Janice and Linda watch Isabelle rise
and walk about the cage She goes over to the other
monkeys and joins in their grooming rituals

CARTER
Amazing Shes normal absolutely
healthy If you didnt know any
better youd think nothing had
happened to her

MATT
(ribbing Sarah)
Yeah I cant wait to slice up her
brain and trace her neural pathways

SARAH
Screw you Matt

MATT
Well maybe not right away

LINDA
We should celebrate

INT RESTAURANT - NIGHT
The fanciest one in DC
The entire eight person team sits around a round table
drunk and laughing as the last champagne flute is
filled
Sebastian raises his glass
SEBASTIAN
To the finest research team Ive ever

known

A round of Hear hears and they all clink glasses and
drink

EXT RESTAURANT BALCONY - LATER
The din of the diners fades away as Linda slips out onto

the restaurants balcony She find Sebastian leaning
against a railing breathing in the night air

DISSOLVE
SEBASTIAN
Hey

LINDA
I thought youd gone

SEBASTIAN
Where would I go

He looks out over the sweep of the city

the twinkling

lights of DC and darkness of the Potomac river

SEBASTIAN (contd)

Twenty years ago there were no
computers no fax machines no cell
phones I was just wondering what the
world will be like twenty years from

now if what were doing will change
everything

LINDA
A little I am become death the

shatterer of worlds

SEBASTIAN
Something like that

LINDA

Since the day I met all you wanted to

do was change the world
She puts her hand on his shoulder

LINDA (contd)

Listen I know weve I mean well
I just want you to know how proud
I am of you I know it probably

doesnt mean a lot

SEBASTIAN
Actually it does
(beat)

I guess since you were there from the
beginning you know me better than
anyone else on this godforsaken

planet

LINDA

Youre positively maudlin

You should

be happy Do you have any idea what

youve accomplished

SEBASTIAN

Yeah but I was working so hard I
didnt realize Id have no one to

share it with
TO

Sebastian heads back inside But he stops and turns back

SEBASTIAN (contd)
I dont suppose we could turn back the
clock for a night and you could come
home with me

Her look says it all Too much water under the bridge

SEBASTIAN (contd)
Right Sorry Too much champagne

He turns and heads back into the party As he heads in he
passes Matt heading out He and Sebastian exchange

Heys
MATT
What was that about
LINDA
Nothing Its just He is who he is
Sometimes I just have to be reminded
CUT TO

INT LABORATORY - NIGHT

Sebastian wanders through the empty hallways of the
laboratory

INT HALLWAY OF HABITATS - NIGHT

Sebastian paces back and forth examining the habitats
He taps on the Plexiglas of one The cubicle explodes
with

BARKING

We see the Plexi steam up in one part as if something
was breathing on it As if a nose were pressed against
it

SEBASTIAN
(a little drunk
Whats it like Talk goddamnit Tell
me what its like

DISSOLVE

EXT PENTAGON - DAY

Flying over Washington D C we cross the Potomac and
circle the five-cornered building looking particularly
gloomy on this grey day
SEBASTIAN (V0)
Six years ago this committee
commissioned me with a very specific
task

INT PENTAGON CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

At the table are six men A handful of senior military
brass and top civilian advisors direct their attention to
the front of the room where Sebastian flanked by Matt
and Linda is in the middle of his presentation

SEBASTIAN
To successful phase-shift a human
being out of quantum sync with the
visible universe and then return him
safely with no after affects

Next to Sebastian a video shows a small monkey shifting
from the visible spectrum Its hair skin organs and
skeletons slowly dissolve before our eyes

SEBASTIAN (contd)
Well we found out sending them to
never-never-land was easy its the
getting back thats hard

Sebastian fast forwards a few moments until the video
screen shows the bizarrely tangled heap of flesh and bone
that used to be alive

SEBASTIAN (contd)
Every time weve tried to bring a test
subject back from phase-shift
Cellular bonds would dissolve the
primary DNA strands would decay But
now

Sebastian pauses Somethings bothering him

SEBASTIAN (contd)
But now

One of the senior advisers DR HARRY KRAMER
distinguished 50s finally breaks the silence

KRAMER
But now

Linda and Matt look up at Sebastian expectantly

SEBASTIAN (CONTD)
But now
(pause)
But now we feel we are closer than
ever to resolving this issue Weve
been experimenting with a new
regression formula that looks rather
promising
A FOUR STAR GENERAL leans forward

GENERAL
How long

SEBASTIAN
Sir

GENERAL
Son as you can imagine we are very
anxious to field test this tactical
asset How long till you resolve this
issue

Linda starts to speak but Sebastian cuts her off with a
look

SEBASTIAN
Shouldnt be more than another year
Sir

Frustrated sighs all around the room

SEBASTIAN (contd)
Maybe sooner

EXT PENTAGON - DAY
As Linda Matt and Sebastian head to their cars

MATT
Yo Reality check What the hell was
that about

SEBASTIAN
Keep your voice down

MATT
The protocol works Whyd you tell
them it didnt

SEBASTIAN
I wasnt ready for them to know

MATT
But theyre the oversight committee
Theyre supposed to know

LINDA
Im sure he had a reason
(firmly)
You did have a reason didnt you
Sebastian

SEBASTIAN
I had more than a reason I had a
goddamn epiphany

They reach his Porsche

SEBASTIAN (contd)
What do you think theyd do if they
know we could send a subject into
phase shift and pull it back out
again How many seconds would it take
for them to take over the whole
project bringing in their soldiers to
test the formula on Wed have lost
control of it by the end of the week

LINDA
Its their money Sebastian Its
going to happen eventually

SEBASTIAN
I know But not yet Theres too much
for us to learn I dont want my hands
tied by their political agenda when we
go to phase three

MATT
Well then mind telling us how
youre gonna get a human test-subject
for phase three without the committee
finding out

SEBASTIAN
Thats easy Ive decided to test the
procedure

INT LABORATORY CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

SEBASTIAN
on myself

The team sits around the conference table Their jaws
drop and they stare at him with wide eyes

FRANK
Are you nuts

SEBASTIAN
Was Jonas Salk nuts

FRANK
Yeah Pretty sure he was

CARTER
And remember for every Jonas Salk
there are a bunch of guys who arent
famous cuz they died
SEBASTIAN
If were that unsure how can we
morally justify testing it on someone
else

JANICE
Isnt it a little soon to be moving
into phase three anyway

SARAH
Shes right We havent even finished
collating the phase two research

SEBASTIAN
Well have plenty of time to collate
and cross-reference later Monkey data
doesnt matter anyway The only real
data is human data

SARAH
You dont even know if any of the
protocols will work on humans

SEBASTIAN
How are we gonna find out Besides
weve succeeded with a gorilla and
their DNA is 98 the same as humans
And the 2 is not that significant

LINDA
Sebastian humans can talk build
houses and cook in microwave ovens
Gorillas live in trees Thats a
helluva 2 if you ask me

SEBASTIAN
Were all concerned I know that But
if were gonna move forward ever this
is something we have to do

LINDA
Why you Why not one of us

SEBASTIAN
The risks I couldnt ask

MATT
(interrupting)
What if we volunteer

LINDA
What if youre too valuable to lose

SEBASTIAN
Im Project Leader Its my formula
and my call The best way to express
your concern is to make damn sure you
do your best work Ill want about
four weeks to

FRANK
To put your affairs in order

SEBASTIAN
To run some more reversions and tissue
tests and then well attempt the phase
shift Ill stay shifted for three
days of testing and then well perform
a quantum regression

INT SEBASTIANS OFFICE
A knock on the door

SEBASTIAN
Come in

Linda pushes into the room and closes the door behind
her

SEBASTIAN (contd)
What

LINDA
In the past six years Ive never once
challenged your decisions but this
Sebastian I dont think you
should do this

SEBASTIAN
You dont understand

LINDA
Oh please How long were we together
You mustve said it a million times
Nobody knows who built the lunar
lander All they remember in the first
man on the moon

Sebastian shrugs and nods

LINDA (contd)
But what if something happens to
you what about the project

Sebastian smiles

SEBASTIAN
Lin trust me nothings going to
happen

INT BEDROOM - NIGHT

Linda and Matt are in bed together Matt kisses her way
up and down her arm But Linda is distracted

LINDA
He refuses to listen to reason

MATT
Can we talk about this later Im
trying to make love to you

LINDA
Sorry I just cant let it go

Matt props himself up on the pillow

MATT
I know how youre feeling Hell he
and Ive been friends since freshman
year

LINDA
So how can we let him do this

MATT
What if you were given the opportunity
to be the first person on Mars would
you go

LINDA
In a heartbeat

MATT
What if they didnt know whether or
not they could get you home

Linda thinks about it Its still tempting
MATT (contd)
This is his chance to be Chuck Yeager
or Christopher Columbus Well if I
were him Id do the same thing

Matt goes back to kissing Linda

LINDA
Let me ask another question

MATT
Is about who gets to be on top

LINDA
Is the human race really ready for
what were doing

Matt groans and rolls over

MATT
Why do you always get philosophical
before were about to get physical

LINDA
No really Is it ready Were
barrelling down a road that begs moral
and ethical questions that I dont
think we can answer

MATT
They said the same thing about the
bomb They said wed never survive the

nuclear age but here we are
LINDA
This night is still young
(beat)

I mean when you think about it its
creepy Do we really want to live ina
world where people can just disappear
in the blink of an eye

MATT
We made our deal with the devil years
ago Might as well stick around to
cash in

INT MEDICAL EXAMINING ROOM - DAY

Sebastian stripped to his shorts paces nervously A knock
on the door

SEBASTIAN
(his voice catches)
Yes

Matt sticks his head in

MATT
Were ready

Sebastian nervously shakes his limbs out Then nods

SEBASTIAN
Okay

MATT
Its not too late to back out Im
happy to take your place

SEBASTIAN
No Im ready

Matt leads him into the hallway
INT CORRIDOR - DAY

As they walk down the corridor toward the lab
MATT
Nervous

SEBASTIAN
A little

MATT
Ever tell you the one about Superman
and Wonder Woman

SEBASTIAN
I dont think so

MATT
So Supermans flying around the city
and hes horny as hell Lo and behold
he looks down and sees Wonder Woman
completely nude sunning herself up on
the roof of the Justice League I mean
she is lying there naked and spread
eagle So Superman starts thinking
man this is too easy I could go
down there do a little fast pumping
and be gone before she even sees me
After all he is faster than a speeding
bullet right Anyway he swoops down
takes care of business so quick you
cant even see him Well I tell
ya Wonder Woman looks up surprised
as hell and says What the hell was
that And the Invisible Man replies
T dunno know but it sure hurt like
hell

INT LABORATORY
Sebastian shoots Matt a look

SEBASTIAN
You know that could be the last joke
I ever hear

MATT
Cmon man Thats funny shit

The buzz of conversation is punctuated by an amplified
HEARTBEAT thumping its familiar rhythm Bah-bump
Bah-bump In the center of the room Sebastian dressed
only in a pair of jogging shorts is strapped to a table
inclined at a 45 degree angle Electrodes are strapped to
his body An IV tube snakes from the needle in his vein
up to a bag of saline solution Dripping slowly Linda
makes last minute checks of some of the equipment She
pats Sebastian on the shoulder

LINDA
OK Howre you feeling
Sebastian takes a deep breath

SEBASTIAN
Fine

Sarah checks his vitals
SARAH
Pulse 88 BP 140 over 95 A bit

elevated

SEBASTIAN
To be expected

SARAH
No reason for concern Hes ready

Linda takes a moment and studies Sebastians face Shes
almost teary eyed

SEBASTIAN
Hey its gonna be okay

Linda nods Back to business

LINDA
Start recording

INT OBSERVATION BOOTH
Janice hits record on the equipment decks
JANICE
Were hot All systems nominal

Frank coordinates all the data being fed into the
computers He pushes a series of buttons and speaks into

a microphone

FRANK
Okay kids Lets make some history

INT LABORATORY - DAY
Franks voice echoes through the chamber

LINDA
Subject Male Age 29 weight 166 lbs

Matt jabs a hypodermic into small vial of colored liquid
Draws up 20ccs

MATT
(to Linda)
Ready
Linda takes the hypo from Matt

MATT (contd)
If the tests are any indication it
should work quickly

SEBASTIAN
Ill inject myself If anything goes
wrong they cant blame you

She hands the hypo Sebastian and steps away Sebastian
stares at the golden formula silently for a moment

LINDA
We can still shut down Sebastian

He shakes his head

MATT
Any last words

SEBASTIAN
Yeah If Im killed pretend I said
something deep and clever

Then Back to business He inserts the needle into the
IV Sebastian Presses into himself and depresses the
plunger

LINDA
Injection was administered at
(checks watch)
-- 182347

The colored liquid snakes its way into his bloodstream
LINDA (contd)
Keep talking Tell us what youre

feeling

SEBASTIAN
Nothing so far

SARAH
Vitals are stable

They wait and watch

LINDA
Nothings happening

Another moment passes by

MATT
Human DNA structure is slightly more
complex its possible that it may
take more time

Another moment passes

LINDA
Maybe we overlooked something

SEBASTIAN
Recheck the protocol It cant be non-
reactive

CARTER
Kinda like a firecracker with a bad

fuse
Sebastian shoots Carter a questioning look

CARTER (contd)
Dont know if itll go off

LINDA
Frank

FRANK (V0)
(from the booth)
No change in bio-electric

SEBASTIAN
Goddammit

Another long pause Sebastian concentrates

SEBASTIAN (contd)
Okay wait my arm its getting a
bit warm yeah its its
starting to tingle

Excitement overtakes the room

SEBASTIAN (contd)
Okay its spreading to my back
like like a fever

LINDA
Here we go

Slowly the flesh on Sebastians arm begins dissolving
revealing the complex network of nerves blood vessels
and flesh beneath it

SEBASTIAN
Shit its starting to burn Oh
god It hurts I didnt think it would

hurt

The HEART BEAT thumps faster accelerating
SARAH
Heartbeats elevated Pulse at 100

« 130
LINDA
What do you feel Keep talking KEEP
TALKING
SEBASTIAN
Pain
SARAH
Pulse is 165 170 Blood pressure

180 over 100

CARTER
Hes going to blow out his heart

LINDA
Prop the crash cart

Carter grabs the crash cart rolls it in Matt tears off
the IV leads into Sebastians arms

MATT
Weve got to stop it

LINDA
We cant

INT OBSERVATION BOOTH
All the monitors are going crazy

JANICE
Somethings happening

Frank leans into the microphone

FRANK
Listen up Electric activity
increasing in all limbs Brainwaves
are through the roof

JANICE
I didnt think the human brain could
spike that high

FRANK
Maybe it cant

INT LABORATORY
Sebastian screams in dire pain He struggles against his

restraints as his skin liquefies into a muscular mass
Its like somethings eating away at him Gruesome The
yells become louder and more painful to hear

SEBASTIAN
No Oh god NO STOP IT STOP IT

The muscular system begins to dissolve leaving a
struggling skeleton wrapped with tentacular blood vessels
and stuffed with the major organs The beating heart the
heaving lungs

SARAH
Pulse is 180 holding stable
Screaming Then the organs go Then the blood vessels
Leaving only a skeleton howling in pain The jawbones
spread wide Screaming screaming
CARTER
Holy shit

Then as if someone had poured acid all over the bones
the skeleton evaporates into nothingness

SARAH
Pulse is dropping 170
150 160

There is NOTHING left of Sebastian Caine

LINDA
Bio-quantum phase shift occurred at
1826

The screaming continues and the restraints continue to
twist and turn Suddenly the restraints go limp

MATT
Is he dead

Linda checks the readouts

LINDA
No He passed out from the trauma

SARAH
Vitals returning to normal Pulse 110
dropping Blood pressure 130 over

A long beat as everybodys eyes stare at the instruments

FRANK (VO)
Electrical activity is stabilizing

SARAH
Pulse steady at 70
TO

A long beat

MATT
Un-fucking-believable

A reverent pause as Linda runs her fingers over what
would be his skin Small electrical charge dance around
her fingertips She gasps

LINDA
(whispers in his ear)
You did it Sebastian Youre the
first

CARTER
Lets get him into recovery

DISSOLVE

INT RECOVERY CHAMBER

The chamber is half constructed out of Plexiglas at the
end of the Hallway of Habitats

On the recovery bed a sheet drapes over Sebastians
invisible body The gentle bleatings of medical machinery
pound out a dulling rhythm

Linda sleeps in a corner chair as Matt slips into the
room He checks the readouts on Sebastian then takes a
seat by Linda She wakes with a start

MATT
Sokay You nodded off

LINDA
His breathings hypnotic How longs
it been

MATT

Seventeen hours

LINDA
Where are the others

MATT
In the lab crunching numbers Weve
got enough data there for two
lifetimes of research

Linda rubs her temples and gestures to the bed
LINDA

I keep looking at that hole wondering
if hes really there
She notices something out of the corner of his eye The
sheet twitches

LINDA (contd)
Did you see

The sheet twitches again

MATT
He may be coming out of it

Linda and Matt watch intently Then suddenly the
sheets thrash violently A yell of pain

SEBASTIANS VOICE
The lights Turn off the goddamn
lights Ah Christ

Linda jumps up and crosses to Sebastian Matt rushes to
the wall and turns off the lights Darkness The room is
lit by the glow of machinery

SEBASTIANS VOICE (contd)
I cant I cant close my eyes I

cant close my eyes

LINDA
Your eyelids are transparent

The sheets slowly stop thrashing

SEBASTIANS VOICE
So I Im

LINDA
Yes

SEBASTIANS VOICE

My arms I can where I can feel
them

LINDA
Your arms your whole body It

worked Sebastian It worked

The sheet rises and slips away The wires seemingly
connected to thin air spread out like a spiders web and
then fall away one-by-one The monitors all go dead

SEBASTIANS VOICE
Mirror I I want to see

MATT
Over here in the corner

Matt motions to a dark corner of the room toward a
mirror and sink We push in on the mirror No reflection
Suddenly it fogs up Sebastians breath A finger
tracing appears in the fog but of course we see no
finger The sink faucet twists on and water runs It cups
into the shape of hands and lifts into the air splashing
against the surface of Sebastians face Beads of water
cling to his f ace outlining it I shape f or a moment
before dripping away

MATT (contd)
What was it like

SEBASTIANS VOICE
I Its hard to think

Sebastians voice is now behind him Matt turns around

SEBASTIANS VOICE (contd)
The transformation I remember every
molecule in my body shattering

MATT
It was painful

SEBASTIANS VOICE
At first but then everything went
black I couldnt see or hear or feel
anything It was all just black
like I wasnt connected

LINDA
Your system received quite a shock

SEBASTIANS VOICE
At least my senses are starting to
return Youre wearing your
Shalimar arent you

Linda realizes that hes standing very close by Her hair
lifts slightly and Sebastian inhales Chills go down her
spine

LINDA
Sebastian

Lindas hair drops back to her shoulders
SEBASTIANS VOICE
This is weird Im looking through
myself at the floor Im looking right
through myself I cant tell

He bumps into a chair

SEBASTIANS VOICE (contd)
where my body is

A moment of silence
LINDA
Sebastian

No answer Linda and Matt look at each other slightly
alarmed

MATT
Sebastian

An indentation forms on the bed a moment later

SEBASTIANS VOICE
You really cant see me Can you

LINDA
Gimme symptoms Dizziness nausea
headache body-ache disorientation

SEBASTIANS VOICE
No just tired

(beat)
Its funny I can see everything
more than before but I cant see

myself
INT LABORATORY - DAY

Carter Frank Janice and Sarah work at various research
stations The door opens and Linda and Matt enter

CARTER
Hey Hows he doing

LINDA
Why dont you ask him

Linda motions to the gap between her and Matt The four
of them stare at the nothing

SARAH
Sebastian how do you feel

SEBASTIANS VOICE
Not to bad considering

They turn round The voice is coming from behind them
The group rises from their various workstations and turn

toward where the voice came from

SEBASTIANS VOICE (contd)
Odd isnt it

A rheostat switch on the wall turns and the lights dim
Though its a simple act it feels somewhat ominous

LINDA
He cant close his eyes so theyre
sensitive to light

Lindas explanation puts everyone at ease

JANICE
So what was it like

SEBASTIANS VOICE
Over here

Sebastian has moved As everyone turns toward him again
he cant stifle a slight giggle

LINDA
Cmon Sebastian Knock it off

SEBASTIANS VOICE
Sorry Couldnt resist

His voice again come s from somewhere else in the room

FRANK
I feel like were playing Marco Polo

MATT
Well I see the procedure hasnt
changed your personality

Frank pulls on a pair of THERMAL GOGGLES

FRANK
No worries Im on it

THERMAL POV - Every body in the laboratory shows up as a
heat signature including Sebastian Frank points

FRANK (contd)
Gotcha big man

THERMAL POV - The HEAT SIGNATURE reaches for a chair
SEBASTIANS VOICE
Boy you people have no sense of

humor

A chair slides back from a desk and bends under
Sebastians weight

SEBASTIANS VOICE (contd)
Show me So
CUT TO

INT LABORATORY - NIGHT
Frank and Janice shuttle the playback controls as a VIDEO
MONITOR re-plays various angles of Sebastians phase

burn Epidermal reaction

JANICE

Janice scribble the numbers in her notebook Linda
crosses nursing a cup of coffee

Heavy sigh

LINDA
Its late Time you got some rest

SEBASTIANS VOICE
Just a little longer

LINDA
Hate to pull rank but youre my
patient now and you need rest Weve
got a busy day tomorrow

SEBASTIANS VOICE
Fine

INT THE RECOVERY ROOM - NIGHT

As Linda enters she points to a small camera in the upper
corner of the room

LINDA
Weve set up a thermal camera for
observation and Ive arranged one of
us to be here 247 in case you need
anything The teams gonna be on alpha-
call alert for the duration If
anything goes wrong we can all be
here within

SEBASTIANS VOICE
Thirty minutes Yes I know I wrote
the procedure

LINDA
I was trying to be reassuring
SEBASTIANS VOICE
You like this dont you

LINDA
Whats that

SEBASTIANS VOICE
Being in charge

Its clear she does But shes certainly not going to
admit it

LINDA
Please Im just doing my job

CUT TO

CLOSE ON A video screen A thermal lump lays stretched
out on the bed

Pull back to reveal SARAH staring at the screen We are

INT OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT

A bank of monitors display the various angles of the Hall
of Habitats the laboratory and of course Sebastian in

the recovery room

Linda hands Sarah a cup of coffee

LINDA
You gonna be okay

SARAH
Fine Its not like I have anything
else going on in my sad pathetic life

LINDA
Carterll be in at six to spell you

Through the glass wall Linda sees Matt knocking and
waving her out

SARAH
Im fine Go on ahead

INT CORRIDOR - NIGHT

The rest of the team straggles into the elevator
Yawning Exhausted from the day

CARTER

Linda catches Matts eye Gives him a look You coming

over Matt nods yes imperceptible to everyone but
Linda She smiles

INT LABORATORY - NIGHT

Deserted and dark

INT OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT

Late Sarah rubs her temples Her eyelids are heavy
Shes having real trouble staying awake The buzzing
fluorescent light isnt helping either

INT RECOVERY ROOM - NIGHT

The sheets ruffle and the indentation disappears from the
bed We can hear breathing and soft sound of bare feet

shuffling against linoleum

CAMERA SLOWLY PANS toward the door as if we are
following someone walking

The door handle turns and the door pushes open

INT HALLWAY OF HABITATS - NIGHT

WE SLOWLY TRACK DOWN the Hallway of the Habitats We hear
the sounds of sleeping creatures A couple of them growl

at something unseen The growling follows the invisible
something as it passes by

INT LABORATORY - NIGHT

The laboratory door opens and shuts again Ghostly We
see papers shuffling at one of the work stations A glass
moves slightly

INT OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT

Sarah reclines in her chair Fast asleep Behind her is
the glass wall revealing the empty hallway behind it

But a small portion of the glass fogs as if someone had
just breathed on it As the fogged part quickly clears
we see the door to the observation room quietly open

ON SARAH still sleeping We hear a whisper

SEBASTIANS VOICE

DISSOLVE
(whispering)
Sarah Are you awake

Her heavy breathing mixes with Sebastians

SEBASTIANS VOICE (contd)
(barely audible)
Hmm

Sarahs hair moves slightly as if a hand were running
through it And then we see her shirt move like fingers
were tracing over it Down from the shoulder to her
breast Around her nipple Sarah moans slightly as if
she were dreaming but she doesnt stir And then her
breasts cup slightly as if they were being touched
softly gently Her breathing becomes harder more
labored erotic and then she BOLTS AWAKE Bar eyes
wide with fear She jumps and cups her own breasts and
looks around the room Its empty of course She jumps
over to the monitor and checks on Sebastians room The
heat signature isnt there

SARAH
Dr Caine Goddamnit Dr Caine Are

you in here

She listens Its silent She tries holding her breath
listening for his breathing But theres nothing

Sarah reaches over to a microphone Hits a few switches

SARAH (contd)
Dr Caine

VARIOUS SHOTS OF THE COMPOUND

Sarah waits No response

SARAH
Shit

She looks around the room He must be in here

SARAH (contd)
Dr Caine Sebastian Come on this
isnt funny I know youre in here
Nothing No response Sarah waves her hand around
reaching out trying to find him After a few beats she

stops and rubs her head

SARAH (contd)
I must be going crazy

Suddenly Sarah gets an idea She quickly exits the
observation room

EXT CORRIDOR - NIGHT

At a wall storage box she removes a pair of Thermal
Goggles and slips them on

INT OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT
Sarah enters wearing the thermals She scans the room
THERMAL POV - The room is empty
She pulls the goggles off in frustration and when she
glances over at the video screen she sees Sebastians
thermal image lying on the bed in the recovery room
Sarah sinks into her chair a tad disconcerted
INT OBSERVATION ROOM - MORNING
Linda and Matt finish listening to Sarahs story
SARAH
I found him later in the lab running

samples

LINDA
Why didnt you call me

SARAH
Because I wasnt sure Im still not
I mean I couldve easily been
dreaming

MATT
It doesnt sound like something
Sebastian would do

SARAH
God I feel so stupid

LINDA
I can talk to him

SARAH
No I mean
(she torn unsure of herself
It was probably nothing I
shouldntve mentioned it

MATT
You sure

SARAH
Yeah Im sure I mean yknow why
would he do that right Just this
place at night can be kinda creepy
yknow

INT RESEARCH LAB - DAY

Sebastian wearing surgical scrubs sits in an examination
chair Wire leads sprout from the electrodes covering his
head and arms The electrodes seem to outline his body

MATT
So how was your first night

SEBASTIANS VOICE
Restless Hard to sleep when you cant
close your eyes

As Sebastian talks we can see the electrodes around his
jaw pump up and down

MATT
Yeah Whatd you do

SEBASTIANS VOICE
Got up a couple of times Knocked
about

MATT
Yeah Sarah mentioned you werent in
your cubicle She said she called you
over the intercom and you didnt
respond

SEBASTIAN
I guess I didnt hear I had the radio
on

MATT
Itd be helpful to us if youd tell
whoevers on duty where youre going
to I mean if something were to
happen wed want to know where to
find you

SEBASTIAN
I didnt think it was a problem

MATT
It isnt I just dont want it to
become one

Machines pump out EEG EKG readouts Matt studies them

MATT (contd)
Readings are normal

SEBASTIANS VOICE
Next I want to run a VV and UVF
analysis of the platelets

MATT
Well have to draw some more blood

CUT TO

Sarah rolls up Sebastians sleeve revealing empty air
She wraps a bungee cord around the nothing pulls it
tight and sprays the inside of his elbow with dye She
acts very self conscious

SEBASTIANS VOICE
You okay

SARAH
Yeah Why

SEBASTIAN
You just seem a little nervous

SARAH
No IIm fine Hold still This
might hurt a bit

The surface of his skin sheens in the light as Linda
searches for a vein She slaps his arm several times
then plunges a hypodermic needle into his skin His skin
bends and gives The needle remains in sight after it
slips through the visible surface Sarah presses down on
the hypo plunger releasing a dye into his bloodstream

SARAH (contd)
Dr Caine this might sounds stupid

but are you are you looking at me

The red dye twists into a long snaking red tube up and
down his arm His vein

SEBASTIANS VOICE
No I was looking at the clock Why

Sarah draws the plunger back sucking Sebastians blood
into the hypodermic and then yanks the needle out

SARAH
Just felt like someone was staring at
me

Sarah pulls the vial off the needle and labels it with a
grease pencil After a few beats the red dye in
Sebastians blood stream dissolves and disappears as
does the liquid in the vial

TESTING MONTAGE
INT MRI ROOM

MATT slides Sebastians sheet covered frame into an MRI
Even though his head is not visible it shown up on the
MRI scanner

INT MAIN LABORATORY

CARTER and SARAH lower a harness into a water tank
SEBASTIANS BODY displaces the water revealing an empty
body shaped cavity in the water

INT OBSERVATION ROOM

CARTER sips a BIG GULP and stares at a monitor which
shows two eat signatures in the Recovery Chamber huddled
over a chess game

INT RECOVER CHAMBER

on a chessboard A BLACK KNIGHT takes WHITE BISHOP
seemingly all by itself

Across the table Matt leans back and topples his WHITE
KING acknowledging defeat

INT SPECTRAL LAB

Dim lights Janice and Frank both don eye guards Frank
switches on a low intensity laser on and its beam shoots
across the room The beam distorts slightly in the center
of the room As Frank widens the spectral pattern
suddenly the beam splits into a million different
spectral rainbows momentary illuminating Sebastians
entire frame in a glowing tingle of light

INT MAIN LABORATORY

LINDA pulls vials from the cyclotrons and props blood
sample slides She slips them under the microscope She
takes a sip of her Diet Coke and puts it on the table
She pears into the microscope and analyses the blood
sample squeezing more stain onto it She looks up to
make notations but when she reaches for her Diet Coke IT
ISNT THERE She looks around Its on the other side of
her microscope She shrugs it off she takes a sip and
sets it down where it was before She peers into the
microscope again and when she looks up the Diet Coke
is gone She looks around the room and sees it on another
table completely

LINDA
Sebastian Goddamnit

We hear Sebastians laughter echo in the room

SEBASTIANS VOICE
Youve no idea how much fun Ive had
Im going to hate going back

LINDA
Thats what worries me

SEBASTIANS VOICE
How so

LINDA
What happens when we turn the project
over to the Army Ever wonder how much
fun theyre gonna have

SEBASTIANS VOICE
Maybe we wont give it to them His
voice comes from behind her now

We see indentations on her shoulders where his fingers
press down

SEBASTIANS VOICE (contd)
I was thinking tonights my last
night Ever fantasize about making
love to an invisible man

Linda pulls away from him

LINDA
Stop it Sebastian Its not funny

SEBASTIANS VOICE
Well dont do it for me Do it for
science

Linda walks away Sebastian laughs

LINDA
Grow up

SEBASTIANS VOICE
Oh well Missed your big chance

LINDA
Got some sleep Big day tomorrow

INT LABORATORY - DAY
A bevy of activity below us as the scientists prepare
Matt slides the antigen cocktail into the centrifuge and
starts it spinning

Not really I was just starting to
enjoy myself

LINDA
Tough

MATT
Okay man Here we go

Matt inserts the hypo into the vein and presses down on
the plunger The liquid begins to react Small flashes of
light blip up and down the strand of color outlining the
vein

Ba-bump ba-bump the heartbeat starts to speed up

SEBASTIANS VOICE

Wait something something doesnt
feel right
SARAH

Heartbeat elevated

Hes not breathing

Muscles are beginning to appear And eyeballs Frightened

Pulse erratic

Sebastian pulls against his bonds One set tears off

LINDA
Carter

Carter grabs onto the mass of flesh and muscle trying to
hold it back But the restraints snap The half-visible
man is screaming He grabs Carter and throws him across
the room

LINDA (contd)
Sebastian Sebastian

And just for a second Sebastian is fully visible And
free He looks around like a scared animal and rips off

all the wiring

LINDA (contd)
Sebastian

MATT
UP ON

Get a trang Stat

Sarah preps a tranquilizer Sebastian locks eyes with
Linda Hes lost he doesnt know where he is And
suddenly he crumbles to the ground Linda rushes over to
him and puts bar hand on his shoulder Light bleeds from
his skin and his skin begins to dissolve from sight

LINDA
Hes reverting Got him on the table

Matt Linda and Sarah pull the shifting body up and onto
an operating table Carter pulls himself up and heads
back to the group

LINDA (contd)
Get me a IV of AG seven

SARAH
I got no pulse No pulse

MATT
Start CPR

Carter locates Sebastians heart not a difficult thing
because we can actually see it Carters hand pushes down
in the air inches above the heart We see the heart being
pushed and squeezed Sarah slaps an air bag on Sebastian
and starts pumping air into his lungs Sebastians heart
begins to beat again beat on its own

CARTER
Getting a pulse

MATT
Holy shit What happened

LINDA
Sebastian can you hear me Can you
hear me How are his pupils

MATT
I cant see his goddamn pupils

SARAH
I think hes going into shock

We slowly FADE OUT to the sights and sounds of our
scientist- doctors working on Sebastian And the

beeping of Sebastians erratic heartbeat

FADE

A HABITAT

The heartbeat continues In the shadows two Rhesus
Monkeys defend themselves against an unseen attacker
Blood splatters against the Plexiglas wall

We FADE OUT AGAIN
INT CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Linda stares through the Plexiglas walls into the
Recovery Chamber Inside the Chamber Sarah and Carter-
eye the various screens monitoring Sebastians vitals

Linda watches the hollow pocket underneath the blanket
She watches the rhythm of its rises and falls as
Sebastian sleeps Matt comes up behind her

MATT
Just got the tissue sample results
Cellular cohesion is stable

Linda exhales in relief Matt puts his hands on her
shoulder Pulls her close to him

MATT (contd)
How bout you You gonna be okay

LINDA
Guess so
(beat)

I was just thinking about the Apollo
missions Yknow Grissom White and
Chaffee What it was like for them
on that launch pad that day thinking
they were gonna reach the stars only
to burn to death

MATT
Sometimes the test pilots make
history Sometimes the planes crash
and people die

LINDA
But he didnt die did he
(beat)
What if we cant bring him back What
then
MATT

Its just a little hitch is all Hell
be the first to tell that hell crack
it and Im sure he will Itll just
take time

(beat)
Listen lets got out of here We
could drive up to the old observatory
Well take some wine and go count the
stars and forget all this for awhile
She pulls away

LINDA
No I want to be here for him

Linda pushes through the door of the recovery chamber and
takes a seat by Sebastians bedside A little hurt Matt
heads down the corridor

INT CONFERENCE ROOM

Frank and Janice are staring into their coffee when Matt
enters Matt crosses to the coffee machine and pours
himself a cup He takes a seat at the table They all
drink their coffee in silent vigil

INT RECOVERY CHAMBER - DAY

Linda sits by Sebastians bedside listening to the
constant rhythm of the machines

The sheets shift

SEBASTIANS VOICE

(weak)
Hey
LINDA
Hey
SEBASTIAN

So I guess it didnt work
Linda shakes her head

SEBASTIANS VOICE
You look worried It mustve been bad

Sebastians voice is weak and strained

LINDA
You almost died

SEBASTIANS VOICE
Well remember your Nietchze Whatever
doesnt kill me makes me stronger

Linda smiles

LINDA
I should be making you feel better
Not vice versa

SEBASTIANS VOICE
I guess if Im going to be stuck this
way for awhile Id better make some
adjustments

INT RECOVERY CHAMBER - DAY

In a dusty shaft of light

A cotton swab

is dipped by a gloved hand into a jar of flesh-colored
cream make-up We follow the hand as it raises the cotton
swab into the darkness The swab strokes over the black
and the rich fleshy cream spreads revealing

EYE LIDS of a closed eye

The eyelids part unveiling

PITCH BLACK Blink Blink

No eye

Not even a trace of a eye socket Just darkness

A COLORED CONTACT LENS floats through mid-air hovering
before the eyelids It turns and fastens itself to the

darkness between the lids

We PULL BACK slowly as Sebastian lifts a latex FACE MASK
and pulls it over his head

He checks his reflection in the mirror He looks almost
human Almost A face eyes hands the rest of him
covered by surgical scrubs

We pull back and see the rest of the team looking on

MATT
Not too bad

SEBASTIAN
The latexll limit the amount of light
delivered to my optic nerves

LINDA
You could almost pass for human

Sebastian rises He looks eerily removed from reality
with his cold blank expression

SEBASTIANS VOICE
Well it gives you a face to talk to
at least and we can all work in
normal light again

INT LABORATORY - DAY
SERIES OF SHOTS
Carter draws blood from Sebastian
Samples are placed into the cyclotron

like hes been dragged through the nine levels of
purgatory is escorted back to the recovery chamber by
Linda and Matt

He crosses to his bed and collapses on it Closes his
eyes

SEBASTIAN
The testings making me sick

LINDA
Could be the barium or the radiation

MATT
Youre physiology has changed and
well all bets are off

SEBASTIAN
I cant believe I have to spend
another night here
(to Linda)
Suppose youre gonna go home now meet
up with that boyfriend of yours now

Linda and Matt exchange a glance Linda quickly covers

Sebastian packs up a few personal belongings in an
overnight duffle He crosses to his bookcase and pulls

out some books and throws them into the bag

But as he does he notices a light come on in the window
across the courtyard Sebastian turns off his bedroom
light and moves toward the window He peers across the
courtyard into the Brunettes apartment

He watches the Brunette as she comes into the living room
from her front hallway She drops her keys on the table
and begins unbuttoning her blouse as she crosses to the
window Just as the blouse slips off her shoulder she
pulls her blinds shut

SEBASTIAN
Shit

Frustrated Sebastian steps away from the window and then
stops Something has occurred to him

SEBASTIAN (contd)
Dont even think it

He looks down and notices his hand is trembling His
breathing is a little heavy A little nervous He catches
a glimpse at himself in the mirror

SEBASTIAN (contd)
(almost whispering)
Oncejust once

The Brunettes living room light switches off and the
bathroom light switches on We see him fighting an
internal battle and we see him lose it He grabs a hold
of his hand and peels the latex skin off

door steps out into the hallway and looks around Empty
Puzzled she heads back inside her apartment

hear muffled cries of terror We hold on the Brunettes
window as we

something far worse Hes laughing Nervous laughter

passes out tranquilizer guns

JANICE

cautious

LINDA
The Metro stops running after midnight
and hes on foot so he cant have
gotten too far

CARTER
Look this isnt a monkey were
talking about Its Dr Caine Dont
you think youre over reacting

LINDA
This program is classified If hes
out there it means someone might find
out about him He could destroy the
whole program

SEBASTIANS VOICE
Relax Linda No ones gonna find out

They all turn around At the door is Sebastian back in
his latex outfit

MATT
Where the hell have you been

SEBASTIAN
I got a little stir crazy so I went
to my apartment to pick up some stuff

LINDA
Bullshit I went to your apartment and
I happen to know you did a helluva lot
more than pick some stuff up

SEBASTIAN
What are you talking about

LINDA
You of all people How could you

Caught dead to rights Sebastian sinks into his chair
thinks she knows

LINDA (contd)
You put yourself and this project at
risk

SEBASTIAN
Just what did you see in my apartment

LINDA
I saw your face and your clothes

MATT
It was bad enough you left without an
escort but to take off the
(he motions to his face)
out in public

Sebastian realizes that they dont know

SEBASTIAN
Dont make a mountain out of molehill
I didnt let anyone see me

LINDA
Thats not good enough When youre
outside the lab there are a thousand
variables none of us can control Its
just not safe for you to be out there
TO

SEBASTIAN
Come on Linda You dont expect me to
be some kind of prisoner

LINDA
You volunteered for this Sebastian
You knew going in there could be
consequences

(beat)

For the security of this project Im
gonna have to ask you to confine
yourself to the compound

SEBASTIAN
Im still Project Leader Linda Its
my decision to make

LINDA
Youre right Its your decision But
if you leave the compound again Ill
notify the oversight committee Then
they can make the decision You

understand
SEBASTIAN
Matt
MATT

Sorry man Youd do the same if it
were the other way around

A long beat Sebastian slowly rises acknowledges Linda
with a nod and leaves the room Linda looks around at her
silent co-workers the goggles and trangs still on the
table

LINDA
Pack em up Everyone go home

DISSOLVE

INT LABORATORY - DAY

The Lab is buzzing with the usual activity Linda rolls
up Sebastians sleeve revealing nothing

LINDA
Hold still

She wraps a bungee cord around the nothing and pulls it
tight She then sprays the inside of his elbow with dye

SEBASTIAN
(contentious)
How much blood do you think youve
taken so far
The surface of his skin sheens in the light as Linda
searches for a vein She slaps his arm several times
then plunges a hypodermic needle into his skin

LINDA
Not enough to worry about

SEBASTIAN
Every day feels like youre sucking
me dry

Linda presses down on the hypodermic plunger releasing a
dye into his bloodstream

SEBASTIAN (contd)
Its funny All these years Ive known
you I never pegged you for a
megalomanic

LINDA
What are you talking about

SEBASTIAN
The shoe being on the other foot You
getting to run things

LINDA
I didnt ask for this Caine But when
a classified experiment disappears in
the middle of the night someones
gotta run the show

(tries sympathy)

Look I know how hard this has been
for you

He knocks her arm away and pulls the hypo out of his
arm

SEBASTIAN

Dont patronize me
(beat)

And for the record youve got no idea
what its like I get up every morning
and you people stick needles in me
You bombard me with radiation until I
vomit And then at six its over for
you You get to go home But Sebastian
is still here Sebastian cant leave
or else Thats the worst part you
know Here I have this this GIFT
and I cant even use it

LINDA
Now its a gift

SEBASTIAN
Youre goddamn right its a gift And
if you werent so goddamned short
sighted Id be out there right now
trying to master it

Sebastian looks around at the other scientists staring at
him He tosses the hypo with the needle onto the
instrument tray and heads toward the door

LINDA
Wherere you going

SEBASTIAN
Looks like Im going nowhere

MATT
Come on man Weve got a ton of tests
scheduled today

SEBASTIAN
Do them yourself

INT RECOVERY CHAMBER - NIGHT

Linda enters to find Sebastian reading the collected
works of TS Elliot

Linda looks over his shoulder

LINDA
We are the hollow men the stuffed
men headpieces filled with straw

SEBASTIAN
Funny huh Ive become a literal
metaphor

He puts the books down

LINDA
I dont want to fight you I just want
whats best for the program

SEBASTIAN
I know And you being right doesnt
make it any easier for me

LINDA
You can be scared Thats okay
SEBASTIAN
Im not scared of being stuck this
way With a little more make-up and
practice I could
(he motions to his face)
pass Yknow get by in the world
But the testing

LINDA
Youre talking like youve given up
Its only been a few months

SEBASTIAN
What if its years I dont know how
much more testing I can take

more cells appear filling the gap

They wait Linda points to a blank patch on the screen

LINDA

But the blood cells nearest the blank patch twinkle out
existence and then those around them also blink away
until after a beat the screen is empty

MATT
Full quantum cascade at 95
(beat)
Im sorry
SEBASTIAN
Youre sorry Youre fucking sorry

Sebastian picks up a glass beaker and hurls it against
the wall It shatters

SEBASTIAN (contd)
Six weeks of this shit and youre
sorry

He grabs more equipment and begins tossing it in a rage
Carter and Janice grab him and restrain him After
struggling against them a beat or two Sebastian calms
down and pushes away from them and heads out the door

JANICE
I dont blame him

LINDA
Ill go talk to him

MATT
Leave him alone He just needs to blow
off some steam

INT RECOVERY CHAMBER - NIGHT

CUT TO

Sebastian lies in his bed staring at the security
camera The camera stares back at him

As if from a dream we hear the Brunettes muffled scream
and cries for help As we push in on Sebastians cold
eyes we can barely make out her face thrashing back in
forth in panic and confusion

Sebastian suddenly rises

He crosses to the video camera and examines a small panel
on the underneath of the camera

He reaches into a box of twinkies and pulls out one of
the sponge cakes and begins munching He hits the

Sebastian holds his latex head on his lap while EEG
leads hang suspended in mid-air outlining his real head

Hanging out in the girls locker room
Kicking Jimmy Margianis ass

SEBASTIANS VOICE
Jimmy Margiani

CARTER
School asshole Drove a red Trans Am
Back then I was the size of a small
planet and made a rather large target

SEBASTIANS VOICE
Ever think up anything along the grand
scale

CARTER
Sure World domination Manipulating
stock markets consolidating a
political power base But those are
more recent fantasies

Carter pulls off the electrodes and Sebastian slides on
his latex facemask

SEBASTIAN
And what if it werent fantasy What
if you were out there in the world and
could do whatever you wanted with no
consequences whatsoever How far would

go I mean if it were real
CARTER
I dont know man Out in the real
world I mean theres a
responsibility
SEBASTIAN

Lets say you saw a woman with amazing
tits Would you brush against them

CARTER
Hell I try and do that now

SEBASTIAN
Human nature So if you could get away
with more would you do more

CARTER
I read that in a survey at a major
university they asked college students
Would you steal if you were
guaranteed to get away with it 82
said yes

SEBASTIAN
Eighty two percent Makes you wonder
if the worlds ready for what were

As she leaves the Lab he follows her down the hallway

EXT LINDAS APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

Linda passes through the revolving doors of her apartment
building A few beats later as if caught by a gust of

wind the revolving door slowly turns on its own

INT APARTMENTS HALLWAY - NIGHT
Linda slips into her apartment and the door closes behind
her A moment later we see the doorknob turn back and
forth Its locked

EXT ALLEY - NIGHT

On a fire escape we see the ladder shake and descend to
the ground The metal rattles back and forth as if
something were climbing it

We slowly crane up the fire escape and hold on a window
Through the wispy curtains and dirty glass we can see
Linda enter the room The panel of glass fogs from
Sebastians breath The fog wipes away seemingly by
itself

But then through the window we see Matt walk into the
living room and put his arms around Lindas waist We
hear a shocked intake of air

He kisses her neck and then slowly unzips her dress Her
dress falls to the floor Matt takes off his sport coat
and drapes it over a chair while Linda unfastens the
buttons of his shirt Theyre laughing now exchanging
kisses

Matt reaches behind Linda and unhooks her bra He kisses
his way down her neck to her breasts Linda pulls him to

her

Suddenly the window shatters Startled both Matt and
Linda jump back covering themselves

We hear Sebastians footsteps as he retreats down the
fire escape

A moment later Matt reaches the window and peers out He
sees the fire escape ladder slowly rise back up down

below

LINDA
What was it

MATT
I dont know I dont see anything

Matt picks up a piece of glass and examines it

MATT (contd)
Its like something hit it

Linda picks up the phone and dials
INT OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT

Matt pulls her into him

MATT
Relax its nothing Where were we

INT RECOVERY CHAMBER - NIGHT

BARKING can be heard in the background That horrible
repetitive barking that grates the soul like Chinese
water torture

SEBASTIANS VOICE
Be quiet

A photograph of Linda drifts through the air and settles
atop a flaming candle It ignites into fire twisting and
turning in mid-air then falling on the floor as ash A
beat later water runs from the sink faucet It forms in
the shape of hands and splashes against his face
dripping away

SEBASTIANS VOICE (contd)
And the cyclops screamed out Who is
it who blinds me and Odysseus
replied Nobody is my name And the
Cyclops raged to his friends Nobody
is killing me Nobody

The barking continues A moment later the chamber door
slides open We push down the

HALLWAY OF THE HABITATS

» until we are face-to-face with the unhappy barking
dog

SEBASTIANS VOICE
Shhhh Its Nobody-Its nothing
TO

The Plexiglas door to the doggies cage swings open and
some invisible force grabs little doggie around the neck
The force squeezes its little fur ball throat until the
barking stops

SEBASTIANS VOICE (contd)
Nobodys gonna hurt you

The force keeps squeezing until the little doggie goes
limp Then the dog smashes against the Plexiglas over and
over until blood spills out its mouth The Plexiglas door
swings closed again and moments later the door to
Sebastians cubicle closes as well The water runs in
Sebastians sink washing the blood away from his now half
visible hands

SARAH
A windpipe doesnt just suddenly
collapse Someone or something killed
it

MATT
You saw the tape The man was in his
chamber

SARAH
Then we have a problem because I the
cage was locked from the outside That
means it was opened the dog was
killed and the cage was closed and
locked again Only a human could do
that

out from shallow puddlesas Sebastian walks through

We follow Sebastian down the hallway to his cubicle But
as he rounds the corner he quickly ducks back The
entire research team is in his cubicle Sebastian slowly
approaches and watches as Frank takes down his video
board

FRANK
Pretty clever really All it does is
recycle the signal He flips this
switch it takes a snapshot and thats
all we see

LINDA
Asshole

JANICE

EXT DR KRAMERS HOUSE - POTOMAC MD - NIGHT

The stately stone house sits on a finely manicured lawn
in one of the nicest neighborhoods in town Lindas car

is parked on the curb in front

We break from a typical establishing shot and as the
CAMERA tracks closer to the house we realize that we are

SEBASTIANS POV
We hear breathing and footsteps as we push through some

bushes and head toward a bay window which looks into the
Kramer living room

Through the glass we see LINDA and MATT seated across
from DR KRAMER We cant hear what theyre saying but it
certainly looks serious Kramer puffs on a pipe and
strokes his beard shaking his head

Kramer rises and shakes hands with Linda and Matt and
the three of them head toward the front door

We move away from the window and track toward the front
door As the door opens we begin to hear the tail end of
the conversation

KRAMER
Ill call General Caster right now and
convene the oversight committee
tomorrow

LINDA
Thank you sir

MATT
What do we do in the meantime
KRAMER
Just sit tight and wait for my call

Matt and Linda head down to her car Kramer heads back
inside

Kramer heads back into the living room His wife appears
a the upstairs railing

MRS KRAMER
What was that about

KRAMER
Just a little trouble at work

MRS KRAMER
You coming up

KRAMER
In a minute I have to make a few
calls

Mrs Kramer retreats back to her bedroom as Dr Kramer
crosses over to the telephone He picks up the receiver
and starts dialing In the middle of dialing the phone
goes dead He clicks the hookswitch up and down trying to
get a dial tone Nothing He checks the connections on
the phone and then follows the wiring to the wall The
lines plugged in Weird He hears a door creak open in
the kitchen

KRAMER (contd)
Hello Hello

Kramer crosses to the darkened kitchen The kitchen door
leading to the backyard is open Puzzled he crosses to
it A wind stirs across the pool and backyard swirling
dead leaves in small twists of wind The windchime rings
lightly Kramer steps out

EXT POOLPATIO BACKYARD - NIGHT

In the dim spillover light from house Kramer crosses to
the telephone- box against the back of the house It Is
open and several of the wires have been pulled He looks
around spooked and puffs out a cloud of smoke from his
pipe For the briefest of instants Sebastians face is
visible in the smoke Kramer jumps back in surprise and
the pipe drops from his mouth He gives a small sharp
cry but deep indentations appear across his mouth and
his cries are stifled In the darkness we can make out
his form writhing as if possessed The struggle continues
a beat until Kramer manages to break free
KRAMER
Help HELP MARTHA HELP

As Kramer runs he looks behind him But no ones there
WHAM Something slams into Kramer and he tumbles rolling
into the pool But as he hits water theres not just one
splash but TWO In the water next to him is human shaped
AIR-POCKET Its Sebastian displacing the water And
because of the water displacement we can clearly see two
arms pushing Kramer beneath the waters surface

MARTHA KRAMER opens the bedroom window and looks down at
the pool All she can see is her husband drowning his
flailing limbs kicking up a massive air bubble around
him She races from the window Kramer kicks and flails
for a few moments and then his limbs stop moving A
moment later he floats to surface face down The AIR
POCKET bobs over to the pool ladder and rising from the
pool we see Sebastians body outlined in sheets of
water The shape melts away in a cascading waterfall
until all we can see of Sebastian are the hundreds of
tiny droplets still clinging to his body caught in the
light like twinkling bulbs on a Christmas tree The shape
disappears into the darkness A moment later Martha
emerges from the house and sees her husband floating face

shot He signals Carter Carter levels his pistol too

Those signatures theyre coming
from the heating vents
Through the goggles Matt sees the tunnel turning red

MATT

sees some movement in the thermal cloud Opens fire But
the thermal signature disappears into the heat Matt
cant distinguish anything through his goggles anymore
He pulls them off and holds him gun in front of him
sweeping the hallway

SEBASTIANS VOICE
MarcoPolo Marco Polo

His voice keeps shifting Matt fires

SEBASTIANS VOICE (contd)
Not even close

Matt sweeps his front leg back and forth like a blind
man using a cane But his foot isnt hitting anything He
sees a FIRE EXTINGUISHER mounted on the wall He rushes
it turns it on the hallway and sprays And SOMETHING
LUNGES through the foam GRABS HIM sending him tumbling
down the tunnel Matt is thrown against the wall Blood
coming from his brow He scrambles away spraying more
foam Sees a shape in the mist raises his pistol and
FIRES The shape leaps away The DART FLIES Doesnt hit
Matt scrambles back into a corner His pistol is empty

SEBASTIAN

This way

They shear off the main corridor into the side corridor
Carter lies crumpled up ahead Sarah slides to his side
Carters head rests in a pool of blood She checks his
pulse while Frank takes a protective position

SARAH (contd)
Pulse is weak Breathing shallow

FRANK
Hell be okay
SARAH

Isolated in the Hallway of Habitats is a single blip

LINDA

Sarah grabs a sheet from the counter top Folds it and
presses it against the head wound
SARAH (contd)
Hes lost a lot of blood Here Hold

She guides Franks hands to the wound

SARAH (contd)
Keep applying pressure

Sarah pulls out a saline solution IV bag and slap it on
the rack She fumbles with the needle as she tries to
find a vein

INT CORRIDOR

Sarah exits the lab Checks the corridor Down at the end
of the cramped tunnel is the supply room

She swallows her fear and heads toward it all the while
glancing side-to-side and behind her

INT SUPPLY ROOM

Spooked Sarah bursts into the room She goes to the
supply fridgefreezer pulls open the door and sorts
through blood bags

INT TUNNEL

Matt and Linda push along the corridor Matt spraying

with the fire extinguisher in short controlled bursts
Linda clutching her tranquilizer like a commando
A noise behind them Footsteps

Matt turns to blast with the extinguisher The white
chemical dust sprays out outlining a shape in the
tunnel But it isnt a human shape

Matts uniform shreds Something with fierce sharp claws
fells him Tearing into his flesh We see a angry hungry

face jabbing for a moment through the lingering fog
MATT
Ahh Shit

Linda tries to get a clear shot off through the smoke
Matt trips and goes sprawling Something yelps A howl
Linda shoots Her dart jabs into something which
collapses to the ground A moment of calm As the dusty
chemical foam settles the outline of a great ape
appears still twitching

MATT (contd)
Karl Three Nice shot

LINDA
Hes let the animals out It wasnt
him we were tracking

Linda leans against the wall still clutching her trang
gun at the ready The heat is getting to bar Bar scrubs
are soaked her hairs a mess She wipes the sweat from
her brow

LINDA (contd)
You okay

MATT
It wont kill me unless it gets
infected You

LINDA
Me Dont ask about me If he
freed all the animals we could have
dozens running around the lab

MATT
So he could be anywhere right now

Matt sprays the whole tunnel putting down a gentle cloud
mist Nothing else appears

MATT (contd)
What do we do

LINDA
Get to the lab lock the goddamn doors
and pray to God Frank can reprogram
the elevator
INT SUPPLY ROOM

Sarah finishes collecting blood bags and shuts the door
to the fridgefreezer

The DOOR SLAMS behind her She freezes and slowly turns

SARAH
Frank

She eyes the supply room looking for a sign of movement

SARAH (contd)
(frightened whisper)
Whos there

She listens Is that breathing she hears Now shes
starting to panic

SARAH (contd)
Dr Caine

She starts to back away but shes already in the corner
She clutches her tranquilizer gun but theres nothing to
aim at The vials of blood on the shelf gives her an
idea She reaches over grabs a vial and throws it on the
floor GLASS SHATTERS and BLOOD SMEARS across the
linoleum Sarah tosses another vial and another Becoming
more and more hysterical Splattering more and more
blood But she runs out of vials Shaking with fear she
searches the blood looking for a footprint or movement
But theres nothing there Sarah waits a beat clutching
the tranquilizer gun Takes a step Waits a beat longer

Finally she relaxes It was just her imagination She
heads toward the door when she hears a terrifying whisper
in her ear

SEBASTIANS VOICE
You missed

Her hair flies up and she swings against the wall She
tries to move but shes pinned there Her hands

struggling against the force

SARAH
Please no Let me go Oh god let me

go
The arm holding the tranquilizer gun begins to move

SARAH (contd)
What are you doing No

Sarah fights but her arm moves nonetheless
SARAH (contd)
Help me Oh God Somebody help me
FRANK

Slowly deliberately her own arm moves down the wall and
around until the tranquilizer gun points right at her
stomach

Sarah watches in horror as her own body betrays her

SARAH (contd)
No please Dont do this to me

She struggles shaking back and forth Writhing In
anguish and in fear

SARAH (contd)
What do you want

SEBASTIAN
You

The trigger pulls Pop

A dart explodes from the gun and imbeds in Sarahs
stomach She whimpers as her eyes glass over Suddenly
shes released She stumbles backward and falls lifeless
to the floor A moment of stillness all we can hear is
the sound of someone breathing

On Sarahs face a slight-indentation runs down her
cheek
Almost sweet almost tender And slight indentation

runs across her breast and strokes down her body The
sense of violation and vulnerability is awful Sebastian
sighs

SEBASTIANS VOICE
Ive always liked your feistiness

Sarahs head shifts slightly Her head shifts violently
accompanied by the celery crunch of her neck snapping
Sebastian exhales his breath filled with the
intoxication of power

INT LABORATORY - DAY

Frank applies pressure to the wound waiting for Sarah to
return Carters vital signs are weakening

Linda rushes over to check on Carter

LINDA
Where is she

FRANK
She went to the supply room Carter

Linda grabs a stethoscope and listens to Carters heart

LINDA

Linda would love to cry about it but doesnt afford
herself the luxury

Blood trickles from under the door and bloody footprints
extend down the hallway

They swing open the door

The floor is covered in blood and broken glass But no

Sarah broken is dragged toward the chair eerily
jerking down the hallway seemingly on its own

the hallway past the empty cages in the tunnel of

All clutch their tranquilizer pistols

e footprints lead past the habitats to Sebastians
amber

They see Sarahs body in the dim light

LINDA
Oh god Sarah

The group breaks into a run Linda pushes into the
chamber and falls at Sarahs side Matt cradles Sarahs
head They look for some sign of life as Linda fights
back the tears

LINDA (contd)
No

FRANK

Matt nods Linda slams the cubicle wall with her fist

LINDA
This didnt happen This hasnt

Matt puts his hands on her shoulder to calm her She
pushes him off

A beat

SEBASTIANS VOICE
I would say that what I am

They identify the general area the voice is coming from
Back inside the Chamber They slowly move toward the
Chamber door With lightning speed they slam the door
shut locking Sebastian inside the Recovery Chamber

LINDA

his throat cut and Matt bleeding from multiple stab
wounds with an extension cord around his neck being
pulled tight

LINDA

Linda rushes over and slams into Matt They fall to the
ground Linda crawls over to Matt but her head snaps
back and her lips erupt with blood

SEBASTIANS VOICE
Figured it out You were always so
clever

Matts pulled back across the lab by the cord around his
neck He grabs at the cord trying to breathe Linda
watches him being pulled away

LINDA
No

She clamors over to him But Matt rises in the air and is
tossed against the lab table Linda levels her dart
pistol and fires haphazardly at the air She hits nothing
but objects jerk and move in a line as Sebastian heads
for cover Linda manages to grab Matt and pull him to
her

LINDA (contd)
Hang on

MATT

Linda pulls Matt toward the door

Linda hits the lights The lab is now very very dark

SEBASTIANS VOICE (contd)
See Ive spent all my time down here
thinking up this plan When they find

corpses The result of a terrible
accident Im afraid

Linda reacts to the voice as it grows nearer She
navigates the maze of equipment heading toward the crack
of light at the front door

LINDA
How can you be so brutal

SEBASTIANS VOICE
I guess because I dont have to look
at myself in the mirror anymore

(beat)

Remember that first night I was out I
did something bad just to see if I
could get away with it And when I
did I realized I could have it all I
can kill in broad daylight And
nobodys gonna tell the police they
were fucked by a ghost Anything I
desire I can make happen but not if

a vial of alcohol and dumps it on her hands and then
probes the wound

LINDA
Your losing blood but he didnt hit
the vitals

She looks around

LINDA (contd)
Sutures and thread
She rises and looks outside the porthole into the room
Suddenly it fogs up and she almost sees a face She
stumbles backward and the door starts rattling Linda
scrambles over to hold the metal crowbar in place
Sebastian pulls and rattles on the freezer door To no
avail Its not gonna budge Finally he gives up The
door stops shaking Linda is relieved briefly Still
Then she hears the click of the door locking

OUTSIDE THE FREEZER

CLOSE ON THE REGULATOR as the dial turns from forty-five
degrees down to negative twenty

INSIDE THE FREEZER
Through the porthole Linda sees the bloody footprints
heading toward the door She removes the metal bar and

pushes on the door It wont move

duct tape and pulls off a length

MATT

LINDA
This is temporary

She takes paper towel and cleans off Matts wound She
tapes it using duct tape

LINDA (contd)
You still with me

MATT
Barely

A beat later the compressor begins pumping Arctic air
into the freezer

LINDA
Just keeps getting worse

Linda returns to the door Shakes it
INT CHAMBER - DAY

We hear WHISTLING as we see a sheet of flesh fill out
into a head as Sebastian slides on his latex head piece

INT STORAGE FREEZER
Linda continues shaking the door The lock holds A tear
rolls down Lindas cheek but a strange thing happens
The tear drops freeze Linda shivers as she pulls the icy
tears from her face

LINDA
Oh shit

The inside thermometer has dropped to five degrees

Linda grabs the metal bar and starts smashing it against
the porthole The metal bar just bounces off the glass

INT SEBASTIANS OFFICE

A drawer opens revealing a set of clothing neatly
folded Shirt pants shoes They begin to move

INT STORAGE FREEZER

Linda drops the metal bar and slides down the wall
defeated

MATT
Theres no way out

LINDA
Theres got to be

MATT
They say freezing to death isnt so
bad You just kinda pass out

Matts head rolls back

LINDA
Matt MATT

She checks his pulse Thank god he still has one but
hes not gonna last long Theyre both already starting
to turn a little blue Linda stares desperately up at the
shelves trying to find some sort of advantage Then she
sees something She looks back at the door lock and then
she rises and grabs AN EXTENSION CORD coiled on the
shelf

LINDA (contd)
Were not dying in here
INT BATHROOM - DAY

Sebastian dressed in street clothes stands before the
mirror applying make-up to his latex mask

INT STORAGE FREEZER
Linda finishes stripping the insulation off the electric
cord

She grabs a hypodermic needle package and her cold
fingers fumbles with the package as she tries to pull out
the plastic tube

She finally gets it out and she starts wrapping the
stripped electric wire around the tube in a tight coil

INT BATHROOM - DAY

Sebastian slides on a wig and checks his appearance in
the mirror Pretty smooth Even from relatively close up
he could pass as normal

INT STORAGE FREEZER
Linda furiously winds wire into a coil
INT CORRIDOR

Sebastian heads down the corridor Lingering steam twists
in and around the hallway long wispy tendrils Sebastian
pauses for a moment hearing A GROWL Suddenly the
hallway seems a lot scarier From beneath his scrubs he
pulls his own tranq gun He listens hearing scraping
and footsteps Watching the water on the floor twitch
With machine like precision he turns and fires The
trang dart halts in mid-air and some invisible thing
tumbles over

Sebastian continues down the hallway
INT STORAGE FREEZER

Linda holds the plug end of the extension cord The other
end is wrapped into a tight long coil Linda looks for an
outlet but cant find one She looks at the overhead

lights

A moment later shes climbing up the shelving She wrap
a piece of fabric around her hand and with a sharp punch
she smashes one of the overhead light bulbs

INT LABORATORY

Sebastian enters fully dressed At a distance itd be
hard to tell his secret He pulls several chemicals off
the shelves Then he pulls a tray of test tubes over and
begins mixing

INT STORAGE FREEZER
Linda works on jerry rigging the two ends of the wire to

the lightbulb socket
Suddenly the coiled wire springs to life and flies
against the nearest metal surface Shes made an
electromagnet

INT LABORATORY

Sebastian loads the filled test tubes into the
centrifuge Dozens of other vials are already slotted He
takes one of the left over vials considers it a moment
and then flings it over to the other side of the lab The
vial shatters and

EXPLODES
A powerful explosion that rocks the room
INT STORAGE FREEZER

Linda feels the rumbling as she places the coil up
against the door The magnet attaches itself Linda
shakes the coil trying to get the doorlock to move

OUTSIDE THE DOOR -
We see the lock twitching Shaking
INSIDE THE DOOR -

Linda shivers as she plays with the coil Her eyes glaze
and she stumbles backward Her surgical scrubs once
soaked with sweat are now frozen stiff She composes
herself and pushes back toward the door Her heavy breath
hangs as a low cloud of Mist

INT LABORATORY - DAY

Sebastian looks over the dozens of other test tubes
calculating their combined power in his mind Then he
closes the top of the centrifuge He taps a few commands
into its timer

INT SUPPLY ROOM

The door lock twitches again and twists back The door
swings opens and Linda stumbles out mashing into a
supply shelf of oxygen canisters The canisters tumble
every which way as Linda tumbles to the ground

She scrambles to her feet and goes in after Matt pulling
his cold body out of the storage locker

She pulls stacks of paper down from the shelves into a
trashcan grabs an industrial lighter and ignites the
paper She pushes Matt close to the small bonfire As she
does the oxygen tanks catch her eye

INT CORRIDOR
Sebastian exits the lab locking the door behind him He
heads down the darkened tunnel Something scampers in
front of him Small not visible Sebastian sends it
reeling with a swift violent kick

INT CORRIDOR BY THE ELEVATOR - DAY

Sebastian dressed and in full latex comes striding up
the tunnel He taps a code into the elevator vault doors
The vault doors open revealing the elevator

The doors slide open and Sebastian steps inside

ELEVATOR
Authorization please

SEBASTIAN
Caine One One One One One

ELEVATOR
Authorization valid Thank you

LINDA
Sebastian

And theres Linda Slicked with dirt and blood She holds
a oxygen container with a cut line

LINDA (contd)
I cant let you leave Come on out and
Ill give you one last chance

SEBASTIAN
You said it yourself Lin I shouldnt
hold on to the past

The door starts to shut

LINDA
Aaaaaaahhhh

She hits the top of a LIGHTER duct-taped to the hose A
line of PRESSURIZED FIRE BLOWS into the elevator
WWHHHOOOOSSHHHH Sebastian goes up in flame Linda runs
toward the elevator Just as the doors about to close
she slides Her foot jamming into it

She lets loose with the flame again Sebastian backed
into the corner has no where to go Hes yelling in
pain His latex FACE BUBBLES and burns The surgical
scrubs SINGE BLACK With no other escape route he dives
toward the door Linda looks up to see his flaming body
fly over her back into the corridor Linda kills the
tank as Sebastian continues to burn The elevator lights
flickers and the security panel goes up in a shower of
sparks The elevator dies Linda pulls herself to her
feet and turns to see

Half of Sebastians head MELTED AWAY his latex facade a
gruesome smoke-damaged mass His clothes are half burned
revealing large blistering bubbly welts underneath like
deformed blackened bubble wrap

Sebastian crawls to his feet but Linda hits him with
another shot of flame

Sebastian pulls at his clothes as he crawls around the
corner

SEBASTIAN
Oh God

Linda stalks toward him

LINDA
You wanna see God Ill show you God

Linda turns the corner to see a heap of smoldering latex
and clothing strewn about the corridor floor Sebastian
looking like some ugly creature pushes down the
corridor He throbs with his blackened skin blistering
and cracking up and down his body Linda lets loose
another jet of flame Its smaller than the first and
doesnt quite hit Sebastian Linda checks the tanks
pressure gauge It slowly drops Linda follows the
blackened horror into the maze of tunnels But as he
pushes along the corridor his burns slowly re- absorb
themselves Sebastian is no longer visible A quiet
moment in the hallway as Linda realizes how vulnerable
she is She looks around for him desperately Nothing
But something on the ceiling catches her attention She
blasts it with the last jet of her dying torch THE
SPRINKLER SYSTEM hit by fire comes to life Water
sprays down on the tunnel Sebastian is caught in the
downpour his invisible frame outlined by water It comes
toward her the hot skin steaming in the water He grabs
Linda and slams her against the wall His watery hand
smashes her across her face Linda reels On the floor
she looks to see Sebastian stalking toward her She
crawls away but he grabs her by her hair pulls her to
her feet and slams her against the wall

SEBASTIAN
Im gonna find everyone in your family
and kill them- Your sister she

never liked me I think Ill go after
her and her little boy first

Sebastian smashes her head against a metal post Her head
cuts open blood dripping down

SEBASTIAN (contd)
I just wanted you to know that before
you die
Linda collapses to the floor Sebastians foot presses
against her neck squeezing it Linda gags for breath
But through the shoot of water that is Sebastian we see
something also a watery smudge

BAM

MATT - smashes Sebastian with the metal bar Sebastian
slams against the corridor wall and sinks down

Matt staggers Its taken all his strength to got there
He drops the crowbar and seeks the wall for support he
sinks to his knees by Linda

MATT
Thought Id thought Id save you
for a change

He gives her his hand and pulls her up into his arms

MATT (contd)
Lets got out of here

Just as the two turn Sebastian rises with the crowbar
He swings it with a yell Matt pushes Linda out of the
way his arm glancing the blow into a conduit The
conduit splits open and severs ELECTRICAL wiring The
VOLTAGE shoots up the crowbar and into Sebastian As the
current pulses through his body Sebastian vibrates His
blood vessels yank back to visibility followed by his
skeletal structure and major organs Sebastian is slowly
electrified Smoke pours off him and he becomes more and
more visible Finally he collapses His body throbbing in
and out of visibility Matt and Linda stumble away

INT CORRIDOR - DAY

Just outside the lab Linda tries to pry open the
sealed doors with the crowbar But she cant

Through the doors porthole she sees a collection of
chemicals and the fire raging from the earlier explosion

LINDA
Nitro
Matt peaks inside
MATT
He said it himself All theyll find

is a pile of charred corpses
She sees the centrifuge The timed counter on its face
counts down from a minute Fifty nine Fifty eight Fifty

seven

LINDA
Hes rigged the centrifuge
MATT

In an enclosed space hell wipe out

the whole lab
INT TUNNEL
Linda and Matt move as fast as they can They reach the
burned out elevator What the hell are they gonna do We
know the damn thing doesnt work She swings her crowbar

at the ceiling The maintenance hatch comes down

LINDA
Grab on

Linda hooks the crowbar onto the hatch lip and pulls
herself up She reaches back down for Matt

MATT
Forget about me You go

LINDA
Fuck you Give me your hands

Linda grabs Matts hands and pulls for all shes worth
She struggles but they both manage to got him through
the hatch

INT LABORATORY - DAY

Three two one The centrifuge springs to life

The centrifuge spins the two dozen vials slowly at first
INT VENT

Linda and Matt are on top of the elevator

Lindas hands search the wall Bar fingers run across the
smooth metal surface

From the little light below she can see a maintenance
ladder that spans the entire height of the vertical tube
They look up and see it disappear into the darkness

LINDA
Climb

MATT
But

LINDA
Climb

Matt starts up rung after rung Linda climbs right
behind him
INT LABORATORY

The centrifuge spins faster and faster The vials are
starting to rattle

INT ELEVATOR SHAFT

Linda and Matt pull themselves up the ladder as quick as
they can

MATT
I cant Im going to pass out

LINDA
Keep moving

He does through sheer force of will Blood from his
wound drips down on Lindas face No telling how much
further they have to go in this darkness Light leaks in
from the maintenance hatch below

INT LABORATORY

The centrifuges whine has reached a fevered pitch The
vials shake violently

Then one of the vials shatters

A FLASH OF LIGHT A HUGE EXPLOSION rips through the
laboratory

INT TUNNEL

The EXPLOSION rips through the lab doors A MASSIVE
FIREBALL rolls down the tunnel swallowing everything in
its path

One of the phase shifted animals gets caught in the
flames We see its shape briefly before it disappears In
a wall of fire

INT ELEVATOR SHAFT

The ladder begins to shake The entire shaft begins to
rumble Linda pushes Matt up as they scramble toward
safety

INT EXHAUST VENT

The FIREBALL blows into the vent Starts rolling down it
also

INT TUNNELS

More explosions
CHAIN REACTIONS BOOM BOOM BOOM

THE EXPLOSIONS rolls toward the OPEN ELEVATOR Slamming
into it The elevator flies upward

INT ELEVATOR SHAFT

The rumbling worsens The two desperately cling to the
ladder They looks down to see

The elevator

SURROUNDED BY FLAMES flying up toward them lifted by the
explosions SHOCK WAVES

LINDA
Oh God

MATT
Dont look

The carriage accelerates toward them faster and faster
Its loose cables whip around the shaft slapping the
walls around the pair Its gonna hit them Linda pulls
herself close to the ladder and closes her eyes Shes
pressed against Matt The elevator 50 feet 40
30 WOOOQOO0SH It flames RIGHT BY THEM

When Linda opens her eyes the elevator is HUNDREDS OF
FEET ABOVE THEM and a wall of fire is below them closing
in

LINDA
Move

Panicked Linda pushes Matt up the ladder as she stares
down at the rising fire wall But the fire dissipates
before it hits them though a stray tongue of flames
reaches up to lick the soles of her feet

They hear a terrifying moan and looks up to see the
elevator peaking far above her It slows to a stop and
BEGINS TO FALL

MATT
Its coming down

FASTER AND FASTER Coming back toward them in complete
free- fall Its emergency brakes clamp down slowing it
Metal against metal Sparks flying One of the brakes
shears Then another The elevator unseats from its
tracks SLAMMING against the walls as it TUMBLES Linda
sees that the elevator is out of control and watches as
it ping-pongs toward them smashing into the access
ladder smashing into the wall The elevator slows but
continues slamming side-to-side Linda cringes as the
elevator crashes into the wall above them But it jams
there stopping They pull their heads away from wall and

look up The elevator just hangs there suspended
Theres a small crawlspace between the elevator and the
ladder

LINDA
Cmon Before it slips

They begins to climb up again Matt shimmies through the
tight hollow and squeezes out the other side followed
by Linda She breathes a sigh of relief and just hangs
there a moment when Ah Something grabs her A singed
throbbing hand emerges from the darkness gripping at her
leg

LINDA (contd)
Its him

She kicks at it and sees a dark dirty face - a swirl of
dirt grime and smoke with hollow eyes - rise up the
ladder

MATT
Sebastian you fuck

LINDA
Get off me

Sebastian pulls himself up Lindas body Translucent
dirty hands paving at the fabric of her clothes Linda
tries to climb with this thing on her But Sebastian
grabs her around the neck She begins choking for breath

Linda fights to keep her grip on the ladder She looks
down at the ten foot drop to the elevator and then She
lets go
MATT
No

She and Sebastian plummet through the smoky haze and slam
against the top of the elevator Linda seems to hover a
few above the elevator Sebastians shadowy outline below
her Matt painfully lowers himself down the ladder But
metal groans and the elevator drops another five feet
Linda struggles to her feet Sebastian rises A menacing
dark figure stalking toward her Linda pushes back from
him Sebastian grabs her by the hair and pulls bar over
to the ladder The elevator strains and groans

LINDA
Let go of me

Sebastian presses her up against the ladder Presses into
her from behind He has her trapped His dirty hand
reaches out and strokes her hair

SEBASTIAN
Remember the day we met You were
wearing a red dress and you were so
pretty Now Now look at you

MATT
Get off of her

Sebastian pulls her hair back and kisses her neck with
his filthy dirt-smeared mouth and half-burned away face

MATT (contd)
Sebastian stop it

Linda and Sebastian struggle Matt reaches down to try
and grab her help her

SEBASTIAN
You fucked it all up

Linda looks at her feet The last elevator emergency
brake grips its cable She grits her tooth and grabs hold
of the ladder

LINDA
Go to hell

Linda stamps on the brake release The ELEVATOR TUMBLES
along with Sebastian It slams into the fiery abyss a
hundred yards below Linda hangs one hand holding onto
the ladder the other holding onto Matt Matt pulls her
back onto the ladder using all his remaining strength

EXT WAREHOUSE - DAY

Linda and Matt stumble out into the blazing sunshine
Emergency crews close from all directions sirens
roaring A trail of smoke drifts higher and higher into
the sky

An ambulance pulls up next to them and the paramedics hop
out immediately putting a blanket around her and
treating Matts wounds

MARINE GUARD
What happened

LINDA
We lived

Linda looks over her shoulder at the traces of the ruin
and she sees a shimmer of heat rising from the ground

almost as if something was there

FADE OUT
