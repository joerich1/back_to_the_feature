THE STUNTMAN
FADE IN
EXT ROADSIDE DINER - EARLY MORNING

A strip of two-lane highway runs through a tall pine forest There
is a truck-stop coffee shop beside the roadway A few 14-WHEELERS
are scattered across the big dusty parking lot Morning sunlight
glints off their chrome stacks It bakes the asphalt and warms the
mangy hides of stray DOGS asleep in the dirt A HELICOPTER hovers
about the treetops like a lazy hummingbird Its the beginning of a
perfect day

A highway PATROL CAR slowly trolls among the trucks and dogs and
parks beside the slat and shingled building

TWO TELEPHONE LINEMEN are scaling a power pole at the forests edge
POWER POLE - ANGLE ON TELEPHONE LINEMEN

High on the pole the linemen lean back against their safety straps
to work their bodies forming a Y One of them suddenly turns
pointing at a nearby treetop

FIRST LINEMAN
Lookee there

He grabs a PORCELAIN INSULATOR from his belt cocks his arm and
hurls it across the open stretch It lands smack in the middle of
the tree SQUAWK A rattle of leaves a rustle of feathers anda
HUGE BUZZARD comes flapping out The lineman cackles over his
marksmanship

CLOSE ANGLE ON BUZZARD - MOVING SHOT

The big frightened beady-eyed bird is lumbering through the sky
flapping for its life and suddenlySPLAT It crashes head-on into
the bubble of the passing HELICOPTER

INT HELICOPTER

The ship rocks as the PILOT wrestles the controls There are THREE
OTHERS in the cabin The man beside the pilot ELI CROSS is
sketching in a manuscript and eating an apple He glances up in
irritation

ELI
Hey will you stop wiggling
PILOT
Dont yell at meyell at the
goddamn crazy bird It tried to
kill us

ELI
(back to his manuscript)
Oh yeah thats your story Whats
the bird got to say about it

Eli bites into his apple grimacing at the mushy mouthful He tosses
it out the hatch

EXT FOREST - TREETOPS

The apple drops into the trees bounces down from branch to branch
and falls on the slanted roof of the ROADSIDE DINER beneath It
rolls down the eaves off the edge and lands on top of the parked
Highway Patrol car

INT PATROL CAR

FIRST POLICEMAN
Something hit the roof

SECOND POLICEMAN
So will the Chiefif we dont grab
this guy Cameron

They climb out as we see a SECOND PATROL CAR sliding up behind them
MORE POLICEMEN emerge from the second car

EXT DINER - ON POLICEMEN

They huddle then move toward the diner entrance As they pass an
open WINDOW the CAMERA HOLDS

INT DINER

A FRY COOK serves behind the long counter where MEN on stools eat
watching the overhead TV There is a PINBALL MACHINE in action
The policemen are seen ENTERING bg A TRUCK DRIVER ambles up and
straddles a stool

TRUCK DRIVER
Gettin hot early Its gonna be a
scorcher

The fry cook fills the drivers empty water glass from a pitcher
then move down the counter

ANGLE ON CAMERON

He sits a few stools away Hes about 25 even-featured bone-
weary His appealing face needs a shave The cook fills his water
glass The ice cubes rattle as Camerons hand trembles His eyes
are riveted on the policemen

CAMERONS POV

Two policemen take seats at a booth across from the counter one
policeman moves to a WALL TELEPHONE another stands near the CASH
REGISTER looking at a magazine They seem nonchalant but are
placed to block all avenues of escape

ANGLE ON CAMERON

Suddenly startled as someone slaps him on the arm He whirls to
face the man beside him

MAN
Thats really a beautreally a
beaut

The MAN is staring at the TATOO which shows below the rolled-up
sleeve of Camerons shirt a large American Eagle with elaborate
scrollwork and a patriotic slogan The man pulls up his own sleeve
to show a small tatoo of an anchor

MAN (CONTD)
My wife still yells about thisbut
yours -- thats some eaglelike a
billboard

CAMERON
(eyes on police)
Yeah thats the grand old bird
(a half-smile)
Right now I just wish the son-of-a-
bitch could fly

Cameron rises and moves across the diner to the pinball machine
ANGLE ON PINBALL

The PLAYER wiggles and contorts using body English to influence the
balls
12A

12B

HECKLER
Hey Morton you think your ass is
connected to the machine You
wiggle its gonna make the ball go
where you want

Camerons eyes scan the room passing the TV above the counter On
it the commercial shows a beautiful girl (who well later know as
NINA FRANKLIN) bending over a bowl of dog food Her ass too
wiggles engagingly The pinball player leaves the machine
Cameron stalling for time works the plunger while a cop stalks
closer like the cat to the mouse hole

POLICEMAN
Hey youre lucky Somebody left a
free ball

CAMERON
Uh huh

Cameron shoots The ball bounces crazily inside the machine lights
and buzzers flashing Another policeman approaches

SECOND POLICEMAN
You got 20000 Youre gonna win

CAMERON
Win what

SECOND POLICEMAN
A free game

CAMERON
Terrific

He rests his hands on the machine glancing about Escape seems
hopeless

CAMERON (CONTD)
-thats just what I neededone
more chance to lose

In a lightning-swift motion the cop clamps his hands down over
Camerons wrists snapping the HANDCUFFS on The trap has sprung

CLOSE ON COP AND CAMERON

Cameron nods his head in resignation A big uncontrollable grin
breaks and spreads over the cops face

Then suddenly Cameron bolts desperately springing full speed for
the back door He flings it open The cops are moving toward him
One has almost got his gun out

POLICEMAN
Cameron Halt 1I11 shoot

Cameron lunges through the doorway not realizing in his frenzy the
screen door still blocks his path He tears through it but gets
stuck halfway

CAMERON
(panicked)
NoGod dont shoot

Swinging his manacled arms like a club against the tangled mesh he
breaks free and runs

EXT REAR OF DINER

As Cameron flies down the back steps a COP stationed at the rear
door caught off-guard tries to stop him but is shoved flat on his
back Cameron weaves and scrambles across the yard over fences
between the shed and the barn rolling beneath a building out the
other side Behind him distant shouts and a gunshot

INT FOREST - MOVING SHOT ON CAMERON - DAY

As Cameron runs he moves with a skill that suggests forests are not
alien to him He crouches low following tiny avenues in the maze
of tree trunks scrambling on all fours over needles and fallen
cones Sweat pours down his face His breath rasps in his throat
He breaks into a clearing and FREEZESsuddenly face to face with a
MAN who crouches blocking his path It is one of the telephone
linemen we saw earlier

WIDER ANGLE

The lineman kneeling at his tool chest is surprised by Cameron
The other lineman is halfway up the power pole They both stare at
Camerons handcuffs Cameron edges back his escape route blocked
The man on the ground grabs a WRENCH and moves forward with the same
gleam in his eye we saw when he scared that bird from the tree

LINEMAN
Stand right there like a good old
boy and do what I say You wanna
try and mess with me youve had
fair warning I was a combat Marine
in Korea Okay

The lineman advances on him as Cameron backs away

CAMERON
Korea No shit so was my old
man
(he suddenly stamps his
foot and shrieks)
Aaaaaaaargh

The lineman jumps in surprise Then enraged like a startled bull
he lunges forward with the wrench Cameron uses the mans weight
against him his moves those of a trained fighter A hard knee to
his stomach doubles up the lineman The handcuffed arms slam down
like a club between his shoulder blades driving him to the ground

A kick thrown sideways to his head and the man is out The other
lineman who had started to descend the pole freezes and takes one
step back up Cameron grabs the linemans toolbox in his handcuffed
grasp and dashes off into the forest

MOVING SHOT - ON CAMERON

He slides down a slope on a carpet of fallen leaves tumbling to the
bottom and falls face forward into a running stream where he holds
his head and drinks CAMERA MOVES ACROSS the terrain There are no
pursuers the forest is silent

CLOSE UP - HANDCUFFS

The jaws of a wire-cutter clamp down severing the chain connecting
the cuffs around Camerons wrists He lifts his knee from the
cutter handle His arms are now free He wedges a chisel against
one bracelet and swings a sledgehammer against it We hear his
sharp outcry

ANGLE ON CAMERON

Doubled up holding his wrist in pain The bracelet is still
intact He buttons his shirt cuffs over the metal bands and climbs
the slope to the bright sunlight on the road above

EXT OLD ABANDONED ROAD â€”- DAY

Cameron is trudging along the old road winding down through the
mountainous pass He crosses a bridge Through the arches of its
low stone railing he sees a BLACK RIVER twenty feet below rushing
toward the sea Then glancing back he is suddenly alert

CAMERONS POV

In the far distance almost lost in the shimmering heat waves from
the road is a tiny speck moving toward him

ANGLE ON CAMERON

He clambers down the embankment behind the railing peering out from
this hidden vantage

ANGLE ON ROAD

The speck grows larger The SOUND of the engine is faintly audible
now Sunlight flashes from metal and glass Camerons apprehension
suddenly changes to wonderment for the vehicle is not the police as
he had feared but something else Moving in the shimmering heat
wave is a splendid high humpbacked World War I vintage DUESENBERG
SEDAN with gleaming brass headlights roaring towards him

ANGLE ON CAMERON

He scrambles up the embankment to thumb a ride The Duesenberg
roars past him filling his eyes and mouth with dust Suddenly
there is a screech of brakes

ANGLE ON CAR

The Duesenberg goes into a skid and then bounces to a stop
Running Cameron reaches the car pulls the front door open and
climbs in beside the DRIVER

INT CAR

CAMERON
Thanks I thought you didnt see
me

The driver BURT is a husky red-haired man about Camerons age and
deeply agitated Pounding his fist against the steering wheel he
talks half to Cameron half to himself

BURT
Damn it Screwed it up Lost my
nerve

Fishing a Vicks inhaler from his pocket and shoving it in his
nostril

BURT (CONTD)
Goddamn sinuses Cant even see
straight

Cameron looks at him puzzled

CAMERON
You want me to drive

Burt whirls on him enraged

BURT
What the hell is that supposed to
mean

CAMERON
(confused)
No offensethought you might

BURT
Every one of you jerks is a goddamn
hotshot expert Thanks for the vote
of confidence If you think you can
do any better just come and try it

He puts his boot in Camerons stomach and shoves hard

EXT CAR

Cameron comes flying out and lands on his back in the road as the
Duesenberg squeals forward its open door slamming shut from the
momentum

Stunned the wind knocked out of him Cameron rises to his elbows
Before the old relic has gone thirty yards again the brakes
screech swinging the car into a sliding salute turn one hundred-
eighty degrees and it is suddenly screaming back toward Cameron

INT CAR - ANGLE ON BURT

Driving with one hand on the door handle his head halfway out the
window watching the bridge railing and the water beyond

ANGLE ON ROAD - CAR AND CAMERON

Cameron sprawled on the road is momentarily paralyzed at the sight
of the Duesenbergs great brass grill bearing down His hand closes
over a rock and with the same illogical gesture that a soldier
flings a Coke bottle at a tank Cameron hurls the rock in the
direction of the car and frantically rolls sideways The big
spinning tires brush him as they pass We catch a momentary glimpse
of the rock smashing against the gleam of the passing windshield

As he stops rolling once more face down in the dust eyes closed
expecting death he becomes aware there is only silence He opens
his eyes climbs to his feet The road is empty The Duesenberg is
gone Astonished confused -- he walks to the side of the bridge
where the railing ends and the car might have plunged off There is
nothing below but the rushing black water Here and there bubbles
swirl to the surface They could be from a sinking car or could be
caused by the current

ANGLE ON CAMERON

His thoughts racing Was it the sun has he imagined the whole
thing Suddenly a HELICOPTER appears hovering almost at eye
level Sunlight flashes through the spinning blades like a strobe

WIDER ANGLE

It is the same helicopter we saw in the opening sequence It has
swiftly descended beside the bridge just beyond the railing
catching Cameron with no chance to run or hide FOUR MEN Can be
seen inside the plastic cockpit barely a few feet away The man
beside the PILOT is ELI CROSS He grabs the radio microphone and
begins speaking into it Cameron whirls scrambles down a bank to a
field The helicopter drops to within a few feet of the water
hovers Protected from sight Cameron runs between the tall stalks
away from the road

CAMERON - MOVING SHOT

Glancing back through the stalks as he runs Cameron sees a STAKE
TRUCK barreling toward the sight of the accident In the back
THREE MEN are frantically putting on black wet-suits They look
from this distance like little black toys tumbling against each
other Cameron runs on

EXT BLUFF - OVERLOOKING SEASHORE TOWN

A few hotels like a cluster of old Victorian gingerbread surround
a sandy cove beyond which is the sea There is a fishing pier
boardwalk hot dog stands pizza parlors all swarming with
sunbathing TOURISTS The towns bucolic turn-of-the-century charm
might even survive these if not for a monstrous yellow CONSTRUCTION
CRANE which juts ten stories into the sky from the center of the
sandy cove Cameron appears on the bluff

ANGLE ON CAMERON

Surveying the town -- expressionless a jungle beast going to
survive no matter what -- at least for a few more hours He reaches
down and rips off his trouser legs at the thigh turning them into
cutoffs a vacationing bather might wear He pulls off his worn
boots and flings them into the brush his eyes never leaving the
town below There are crowds to get lost in down there He
unbuttons his sleeve and looks at the handcuff still encircling his
wrist Stopping beside a large rock he smashes the bracelet
against it It wont open Grimacing in pain he re-buttons the
sleeve opens his shirt and begins descending the palisades toward
the town

EXT BOARDWALK

The SCREEN is yellow and on it are the words HAVE A NICE DAY
THE ANGLE WIDENS and we realize the words are on the back of a
YELLOW HAT that jiggles as its wearer walks It is Cameron Beyond
him we see the tide of tourists in oils and ointments flirting with
the sun Teenage girls at portable toilets adjusting their bikinis
The boardwalk cops in white shirts looking like ice cream vendors
whom Cameron deftly avoids Then he looks up at the sky
perplexed the helicopter from the bridge is overhead circling
Cameron watches it warily as he walks

ANGLE ON BOARDWALK

A BIG CROWD has formed at the railing of the pier Many of the
people with CAMERAS CLICKING at the sand below Cameron notices the
helicopter is now sharing the sky with a brightly painted open
cockpit BIPLANE It is a WORLD WAR I FIGHTER with BRITISH INSIGNIA

ANGLE ON BOARDWALK AND SKY
Cameron works his way through the crowd All eyes now look upward

at the plane A LOUD VOICE is HEARD coming through an electric
BULLHORN

- ll -

VOICE
All right people Quiet Were
losing the sun This is a take
Youre welcome to watch but please
no flashbulbs Theyll spoil the
shot

Camerons world has become more ordered again Its a film company
shooting on location -- this somehow must explain the Duesenberg
His eyes go to the scene below

ANGLE ON COVE

A CAMERA RIG suspended from the end of the yellow construction crane
is PHOTOGRAPHING the surf where EXTRAS in German WWI uniforms
unload ashore The bright little plane has started a lazy dive
toward the soldiers its engine whining From here it looks as
fearsome as Snoopy and the Red Baron

ANGLE ON THE BEACH

As the British plane pulls out of the dive there is a tremendous
explosion In the flash of smoke and flame barge rowboats
ammunition and people are blown sky-high The smoke from the
exploding ammunition momentarily obscures the scene

ANGLE ON CROWD

The onlookers are very impressed and pleased and then abruptly their
pleasure turns to horror and disbelief

ANGLE ON COVE
As the smoke lifts the Tom and Jerry violence has become a
horrifying reality Bodies are scattered about One man has been
severed in half drenched in blood Chunks of meat arms and legs
litter the beach
ANGLE ON CROWD
Paralyzed by the sense of catastrophe
MAN
(shouting)

Something went wrong

Then people begin to moan and scream
- 12 -

CLOSE ON CAMERON

Staring tensely at the carnage By reflex a shout escapes his
lips

CAMERON
Medic Get the medics

A WOMAN sags into a faint A small child in the crowd is crying and
clutching Camerons leg

ANGLE ON COVE
As the scene continues we hear a voice on the Bullhorn

VOICE (0S)
Cut I said CUT Thats a print

Suddenly the reality of the horror turns into an obscene absurd
farce as what appear to be the missing parts of bodies begin
wriggling out of the sand where the extras were partially buried to
create the macabre effect and now the extras become whole human
beings before our eyes once again

ANOTHER ANGLE

The crowd reacts in various ways Sighs of relief laughter anger
The exhumed extras wipe sand from their eyes and shake it down their
trouser legs

AD
(yelling)
Beautiful Harvey You gave
everybody a heart attack

HARVEY the Second Unit Director yells back

HARVEY
Eli will hate it He said he wanted
the shot in one Now watch he1l
do six hours of pick-ups

The crowd disperses A TOURIST turns to Cameron

TOURIST
Greatbut why do they always use
so much blood It ruins the
realism dont you think

-13-

CAMERON
(still shaken quietly
mutters)
-easshole

The tourist stiffens as Cameron turns away his attention now drawn
by the beating sound of the helicopter He glances up

CAMERONS POV

The helicopter is descending toward the beach while the FILM CREW
rapidly moves equipment from the last scene into piles to clear a
landing site

ANGLE ON FISHING PIER

Wary of the men in the chopper Cameron is moving down the pier away
from the landing site Suddenly he stops short caught by something

he sees 0S Excitedly he points and begins to shout

CAMERON
Hey Hey you

CAMERONS POV

Below him walking away on the sand is one of the actors with the

same red hair the same old British army jacket as Burt -- the man
in the Duesenberg Hearing the shout the actor stops and
tentatively turns Its a mistake Clearly the features are

different Its not Burt
ANGLE TO INCLUDE CAMERON

Cameron is puzzled He watches as the red-haired actor looks about
to see who called and finding no one starts off but is stopped by
a LITTLE OLD LADY holding a parasol and offering her autograph book

LITTLE OLD LADY
Mr Bailey Arent you Raymond
Bailey the actor Would you please
sign your autograph Write to
Emilyfor eternal peace

Raymond signs the book with the easy charm of a man whos done it a
million times He has those special rugged good looks that belong
to Marlboro men and movie stars

- 14 -

LITTLE OLD LADY (CONTD)
Im certainly glad youre all right
I lost my husband and my son in the
wars

The sound of the chopper blades has become deafening as it hovers
for a landing The Old Lady snatches her autograph book and heads
for the landing site

ANGLE ON HELICOPTER

As it touches the ground and its doors fly open Out step the
CREWMEN and ELI CROSS The ASSISTANT DIRECTOR rushes up and shouts
over the hissing blades of the idling chopper

AD
What happened on the bridge

ELI
(deeply upset)
All the divers found in the car was
the goddamn camera

AD
(stunned)
And Burt

ELI
(anguished)
No Burt All gonecaught in the
current probably andtheyre
diving downstream and searching the
riverbanks butdont say anything
to the crew yet

AD
(softly)
Jesus Christ

ELI
Yeah Jesus Christ

AD
What do you want to do

-15-

ELI
I dont knowcall my mother and
have her tell me it wasnt my
fault
(desperately)
--What the hell could have
happened

Their words are lost in the sound of the rotor as the chopper slowly
rises The sudden WIND from its blades blows some screening off a
pile of equipment It falls on the Little Old Lady who has been
approaching Eli and topples her into the surf She is trapped ina
tangle of ancient skirts and petticoats Before she can regain her
balance a wave tumbles her further into the sea

ANGLE INCLUDING CAMERON

Cameron sitting on the edge of the pier over the water has watched
this mini-disaster The undertow from the wave has swept the Old
Lady directly beneath him Reaching down toward her he yells

CAMERON
Hey Hey give me your hand

He cant quite reach her As a last resort he drops off the edge
into the water by her side

ANGLE ON WATER
He grabs for the struggling Old Lady

CAMERON
Dont be afraid Youre gonna be
okay

Like groping through seaweed he reaches past her tangled skirts
grasps her waist and lifts her to keep her head above water She is
choking gasping for air She turns her face toward him

CAMERONS POV

Her features are distorted they seem to be melting away She frees
her hand and violently tears at her face pulling away the RUBBER
MASK on which is the melting putty and make up With it goes her
wig and what is left is a startlingly beautiful young girl

-16-

CAMERON
My God
(choking on water)
YoureI know youthat girl from

TVthe actress Nina

NINA
(sputtering)
Franklin

The sun glistens on the wet wild young perfection of her face
ingenuously sparkling laughter and for an instant its breathtaking
- a universal boyhood fantasy to suddenly be thrown this close to
that kind of movie star beauty Its something Cameron feels in
the pit of his stomach

CAMERON
My GodWhy the hell

NINA
(laughing and choking)
-Makeup testits for the
film

Regaining his composure enough to attempt flattery but he means it

CAMERON
They gotta be crazy to cover that
face
NINA
(laughing)
Im only old at the end of the
story

As they are only in a few feet of water there is no longer any
reason to hold her He starts to put her down

NINA
No dont do that Rescue me

CAMERON
In three feet of water

NINA
Oh come on please I always wanted
someone to rescue me from

something

Grinning he carries her toward shore
ANGLE ON BEACH

Eli surrounded by the crew and dozens of tourists is standing at
the waters edge as Cameron wades in and sets Nina down

ELI
Nina You damned near scared me to
death

At the sight of Eli she becomes like a little girl who having
skinned her knee and run to daddy now can allow herself to cry

NINA
Oh hell its all ruined now and I
wanted you to see the makeup Eli
Where were youI even got
Raymonds autograph and he didnt
knowYoud have been proud

Nina is surrounded by people who are rubbing her with towels taking
pictures all shouting at once The CROWD closes in excluding
Cameron to the outskirts

ELI
(to the AD)
Get her into a tub then bedand I
want to see her in makeup and
costume again before dinner

THREE CREWMEN hustle her off as she searches the crowd for
Cameronthen spots him

NINA
Hey Thank you That was really
gallantrescuing an old lady
Cameron waves and starts to wander off as they whisk Nina away
ANGLE ON ELI
He moves toward Cameron
ELI
Wait a second I want to thank you

too

As Eli trots up Cameron tenses finally facing this man who saw him
from the helicopter

ELI (CONTD)
- 18 -

Dont run away What is that a
habit with you

CAMERON
Yeah I also smoke too much

ELI
You and Burt on the bridgehow
about telling me what happened

Eli begins to stroll along the sand toward the pilings which support
the pier Cameron hesitates but Elis manner compels him to
follow

CAMERON
I dont know He mustve gone
crazy He tried to run me down

ELI
OhWhy would he do that

CAMERON

(flustered)
---I didnt ask him why All I know
is he was comin at me very fast

(quoting an axiom spouted

by top sergeants in a

thousand boot camps)
You want to get home for
Thanksgiving you better figure the
guy comin at you is tryinâ€™ to kill
youThats one thing I learned
from the gooks

ELI
GooksThat has a nostalgic
ring

They have reached the pier Eli stops he is watching something
OS

ELI (CONTD)
You guys really used to call them
gooks I thought that was just Time
Magazine

- 19 -

CAMERON
That was Nam What should I call
â€˜em WOPS Nobodyd known what I
was talkin about

He turns to follow Elis gaze
CAMERONS POV - POLICE CAR

A POLICE CAR has driven onto the beach From it THREE OFFICERS
have emerged They are armed and efficient looking The PRODUCTION
MANAGER moves to greet them Eli takes Camerons wrist and gently
pulls him back into the shadow of the pilings (privately reacting
to the handcuff he feels beneath the shirt) JAKE the Chief is
irate enough to be clearly heard from this distance

JAKE
All right this time youve had it
Where is he

PRODUCTION MANAGER
Chief Im glad you dropped by Eli
says you gotta do something about
all these people on the beach

JAKE

(bellowing)
Thirty minutes is what youve got to
get your goddamn equipment off this
beach and out of townYou tell
Eli Cross if your men are on the
streets after four oclock Ill
throw their ass in jail

ANGLE ON ELI AND CAMERON

Eli squats down on his heels and leans back against a piling
smiling up at Cameron

ELI
Speaking of jailwould you get
upset if I asked how many cops were
after you

CAMERON
(suddenly grim)
What are ya talkin about
- 20 -

ELI

(off-hand)
Your ID braceletthe look on
your facethe way you ran from the
bridge

(with exaggerated delicacy)
Idont suppose you want to tell
me what you did

Cameron studies Eli not knowing what to make of him

CAMERON
NoI dont

ELI
(brightly with humor)
--Could I try categories

Cameron half laughs despite himself

ELI (CONTD)
(glancing OS)
Ever done any stunt work

CAMERON
What

ELI

Howd you like to be a stunt man
You look like youre in pretty good
shape fast on your feet You could
do it

(getting to his feet)
Besides Youre not gonna have much
choice

WIDER ANGLE

Jake has spotted them and is approaching with his men and the
Production Manager Eli puts his hand on Camerons shoulder and
steps out into the sunlight

ELI
(softly to Cameron)
Now dont get hasty And remember
your ass its just like mine
maybe I can save them both
- 21 -

PRODUCTION MANAGER
(trailing after Jake)
--but weve gotta have three days
to finish this picture

JAKE

(striding toward Eli)
You said youd be gone four days
ago before the season started You
lie break promises

(he is now close enough

and shouting at Eli)
Cross Ive gone out of my way but
this time

A TRAM beeps clangs and passes between them interrupting Jake and
leaving him sputtering As it departs Eli seizes the moment

ELI
Jake its been a rotten morning
Youre hot and tired Lets go in
have us a drink and find out whats
eating you

JAKE
(turning beet red)
Dont treat me like these other
morons You know goddamn well
whats eating me is that Duesenberg
on the bottom of the river with the
dead man in it

There is silence Eli stands thoughtfully kicking the sand with his
toe Then Jake starts shouting again

JAKE (CONTD)
I mean that is a goddamn public
bridge and a public river You go
there without permits without any
precautions and get a man killed

ELI
(gently)
Jake

JAKE
No more bullshit explanations Just
gobefore I figure out how to hang
you with a manslaughter charge

ELI
- 22 -

(after a pause quietly)
No explanationsdont have any
But maybe he does

(staring at Cameron)
Go ahead ask him Jake

Elis words are exploding in Camerons mind -- that illusory event
on the bridge has crystallized into hard reality

CAMERON
(wide-eyed)
-Now waitYoure not blaming me
for
ELI
(wheeling on Cameron)
Why not Burt Because youre a
fake Because youre just a

goddamn daredevil with a head full
of marbles

Cameron vaguely understands that Eli is trying to pass him off as
Burt and that he somehow may be saved by going along with this
madness Eli turning to Jake continues passionately

ELI (CONTD)

He grabs the bread blows the shot
screws you upscrews me up Hes
dumb Jake but thank God he aint
dead yet So do me a favor put
your handcuffs on this son-of-a-
bitch and put him some place where
he cant get hurt

The Chief is dazed If this is Burt the stunt man he is obviously
alive Jake goes to Cameron

JAKE
How did you get out of the car

ELI
He didnt get out Our divers got
him outand brought him back in
the chopper

The Chief stares at Cameron His clothes and hair are wet There
is a small bruise on his cheek from when he fell out of the

Duesenberg He looks the part Jake turns to Eli with resignation

JAKE
-23-

Cross when these three days are up
Im going to arm my men with
shotguns and tell them its open
season on any fruit carrying a
camera

He walks to the waiting police car surrounded by TOURISTS snapping
pictures He glares at them angry at the world Eli puts his arm
on Camerons shoulder and leads him through the dispersing crowd
toward the hotel Eli is now easygoing and friendly

ELI
You did that very well

CAMERON
I didnt get a chance to say a word
I just listened

ELI
There are only a few actors in the
world who have mastered that art
Anyway it was a good audition You
landed the part

CAMERON
How What about the crew They
going to look at me and say â€˜Hi
Burt

ELI
Unless you prefer Hi Elizabeth
Dont worry about my crew they1l
call you anything I want â€˜em to
Look Im not being callous Burt
is a fucking tragedy but theres
nothing in the world I can do about
itIve gotta have this location
for three more daysand you need a
place to hide

They have reached the steps of the HOTEL A BUS has stopped in
front TOURISTS are piling out The POLICE CAR pulls up and parks
nearby Jake and his men can be seen surveying the crowd

AD
(shouting in bg)
Eli The crews waiting We need
the next setup

ELI
- 24 -

The hand Close-up of the hand Be
there in a minute

AD
An Eli minute or a real minute

Eli turns back to Cameron as they mount the steps

CAMERON
By tomorrow the local cops1l know
what I look like I cant hang
around

ELI

(expansively)
Burt stop worrying Havent you

(pointing to the etched

glass doors of the hotel)
That door is the looking glass
and insideis Wonderland Youre

The have reached the front door Eli holds it open for Cameron

ELI
(with mock confidentiality)
Frankly your problems so simple
its almost beneath me Have faith
Alice Close your eyes and enjoy

In exhaustion and resignation Cameron nods and wearily closes his

INT HOTEL BASEMENT - CLOSE ON CAMERONS REFLECTION

His eyes open He stares at his face in the mirror pleased at the
subtle transformation His hair has been cut shorter and dyed red
somehow changing his whole aspect He rubs the red mark on his
wrists where the bracelet has been removed

WIDE ANGLE

Part of the laundry room is being used for the films Hairdressing
Department Cameron sits in a barber chair wearing a plastic apron
surrounded by dryers wigs etc In bg washing machines churn
constantly DENISE the Hairdresser an attractive earthy woman of
thirty-two stands over him He is still wary and trying not to
show it

CAMERON
(looking in mirror)
--Could be worsecould be
greenI think I like it

DENISE
Of course you like itask
anybody Denise gives great hair

Got any grass

CAMERON
(shaking his head)
Nope

She touches his hair to test the dryness holding her hand there for
a moment longer than seems necessary He grins at her rises and
crosses to the wall mirror to get a better look

DENISE
What else dont you have that I
need

She moves to a basement window and gazes out
POV - BEACH

Through the window the crew is setting up a shot while Eli
rehearses with Nina and his red-haired male star RAYMOND BAILEY
(who Cameron earlier saw on the beach) Bailey is dressed as a
World War I British aviator and Nina as a young girl of that era

DENISES VOICE
Our male star isnt going to like
you
- 26 -

TWO SHOT - CAMERON AND DENISE

CAMERON
(moving toward window)
Why not
DENISE

Youre too good looking His idea
of a perfect stunt double is two-
hundreds pounds of hamburger ina
red wig

He studies the view his attention focused on Nina

CAMERON
Whats she like Ive seen her on
TV

DENISE

(irritated by his

interest in Nina)
At selling douche powder shes
fabulous dog foodIm not sure
shes sincere

CAMERON
What are you sore about

DENISE
Im not sore Isnt that what you
wanted to know
(with sarcasm)
--Or did you mean whats the real
Nina Franklin like--without the
greasepaint and tinsel

Moving to a pile of laundry heaped on the floor she pokes around
with the toe of her shoe

DENISE (CONTD)
-You mean whats she like --
underneath

Snaring a crumpled garment she kicks it toward Cameron who catches
it instinctively then holds it up for inspection -- a pair of
(Ninas) lace panties He grins mildly embarrassed by the charade

- 27 -

DENISE (CONTD)
(moving toward him)
What do those say about the girl who
wears them Shy Delicate
Sensitive

She reaches for the panties but instead takes his hand and yanks

sharply pulling him off balance falling back on the laundry pile
with Cameron on top of her their faces inches apart surprise on

his amusement on hers

DENISE (CONTD)
(touching his hair)
Still wetvery wet

Cameron is trying to remember what was it Eli said Close your
eyes relax and enjoy Across the room the washing machines churn
whirl and heave

EXT BEACH AREA

Eli and his crew are shooting a scene a pick-up shot for the
explosion sequence we saw earlier Eli and GABE the cameraman are
lying beside the camera Before them the severed arm protrudes
from the sand in which its owner is buried out of sight

ELI

You sure he can breathe

(a mumbling assent from

beneath the sand)
Wheres Raymond

(Raymond kneels beside

him)
Remember you just crashedyou
were wandering the beach behind the
German lines looking for a place to
hide when you saw the explosion
Youre stunned by the carnage That
bomb was dropped by a guy in your
squadron Okay Roll the film

POV THRU CAMERA

Through the CAMERA WE SEE the arm protruding from the sand We

HEAR os VOICES yelling Turning speed action We see
the fingers begin to move spasmodically Elis voice yells Okay
Raymond

Suddenly the fingers on the hand start to swell bigger and
biggerlike a rubber glove filling with airthen BANG BANG
BANG The (balloon-covered) finaers EXPLODE

- 28 -

ANGLE ON BEACH

Everyone has broken up with laughter at the prank including Eli
Gabe is patting Elis face Raymond squeezing his jaw affectionately
as one would a pet dogs

RAYMOND
(cackling)
Gotcha that time Didnt we

ELI
(through his laughter)
Yeah you got me another half-hour
behind

Eli climbs to his feet as the laughter subsides Cameron now
wearing a uniform exactly like Raymonds watches from the
sidelines

RAYMOND
(gently grinning)
Thought the chief could use a little
cheering up today

ELI
(turning quiet and
serious)
--So you heard the news about
Burt

RAYMOND
(nodding)
Any more word

ELI
(bitterly)
Afraid nottheres no picture ever
made thats worth it

RAYMOND
(shaking his head)
Ill never understand why these guys
do it -- take the chances

29 -

ELI

(thoughtfully)
Dont know Trying to beat the
system I guesswe all know that
some day were gonna die of nothing
more important than wrinklesand
that makes us so scared and crazy
well do anything Go off
bridgesfight windmillswars
anything

There is great sadness among them Eli breaks the mood lightly

ELI (CONTD)
Thats what our films about -- or
didnt you know
(sees Cameron)
Hey Burt come over here

Cameron crosses to them He and Raymond stand appraising each
other red-haired men in identical uniforms As Raymond offers his

hand

RAYMOND
(to Eli)
My new cock and balls

ELI

(quickly)
Not newIts important not to let
that get around as yet So for the
time being lets make like hes the
same guy

(adding a touch of color)
But no longer known as Bad-assed
Burt Ever since his fortunate
rescuewe call him Lucky

EXT CHURCHYARD - ANGLE ON CHUCK - LATER THAT DAY

CHUCK BARTON is a tall rugged-looking man in his mid-thirties the
Stunt Gaffer on Elis film A MESSENGER trots up and presents a

receipt book

Chuck sets down his stunt bag and signs it absently

MESSENGER
Your film from that camera in the
Duesenbergs on the way to the lab
Put it on the plane with my own
little hands

CHUCK
- 30 -

When do we get it back

MESSENGER
Dont know Stamped it rush

CHUCK

If I stamp rush on my mares ass
shell still take eleven months to
foal Call the lab and find out
when

(quietly)
I lost a man today I wanna see
that footage and find out why

As the Messenger leaves Chuck strolls over to where Cameron stands
waiting circles around him sizing him up Cameron is no longer
wearing the uniform but now is in jeans and a work shirt

CHUCK
Done any stunt work

CAMERON
Not really

CHUCK
Not really You have or you
havent

CAMERON
(good-naturedly )
I got out of Vietnam in one piece
Let me tell you that wasnt a bad
stunt

CHUCK
(skeptically)
Thats ancient history

CAMERON
Seems like yesterday

CHUCK
(pointing at church
steeple)
Could you jump from that tower to
the that roof

-31-

ANGLE ON CAMERON (AND STEEPLE)

Gauging the fifteen-foot gap between the CHURCH STEEPLE and the roof
of the nearby MUNICIPAL BUILDING He unconsciously grimaces at the
four-story drop between them

CAMERON
(being glib)
Once to save my ass I jumped out
of a banana tree into an oxcart full
of buffalo shit Does that count

CHUCK
Well see Put these on

He throws Cameron some knee pads from his stunt bag and begins
marking off two lines on the bare earth between the gravestones in
the churchyard

CAMERON
(puzzled by the pads)
Where do they go

CHUCK
(tapping his knee)
Under the pants
(pointing to lines he has
drawn )
I want you to jump from hereto
there

Cameron hops up to the starting line finishing with the knee pads
clumsily surveys the distance of not more than seven feet

CAMERON
Okie-dokie

Makes a casual jump landing on the line and looking at Chuck for
approval

CHUCK
Very good Except youre dead
Your brains are scattered all over
the goddamn pavement You landed on
the edge and fell backwards four
stories Where do we send the body
- 32 -

CAMERON
(returns to the starting
line)
Dont bury me yet

He takes a running start and leaps hard While hes still in mid-
air Chuck yells

CHUCK
Youre still dead You fell over
the other side of the building

Cameron has landed three beyond the mark and looks up at Chuck a bit
shaken

CHUCK (CONTD)
You wanna try it right once You
should land in a tuck-and-roll

CAMERON
Show me sergeant

Chuck launches himself head-first His hands touch the ground just
beyond the second mark to break his fall easing him into a shoulder
roll he somersaults to his feet

CAMERON
Very fancy

He takes a running start and does the same Not quite as well but
well enough As he rolls to his feet

CAMERON
Okay

CHUCK
Better

CAMERON

My speciality is Hopscotch

Chuck turns on him enraged overreacting

- 33 -

CHUCK
And Burts specialty was drowning
You know one goddamn daredevil on
this picture was enough What the
hell was Eli thinking giving me a
smart-ass cocky amateur kid when I
need a stunt man Its a little
different running across that roof
when theyre pumping tracer bullets
over your head

CAMERON

(eloquently pleading his

case)
I was running for twenty-six months
with guys shooting at menot over
my headat my head and Im alive
I knew daredevils I got nothing
against themits just theyre all
dead So ease off and give me a
chance

Cameron is surprised to see that Chuck is grinning

CAMERON (CONTD)
(genuinely)
Hey were you putting me on

CHUCK
Me I wouldnt know how to do that

Chuck starts to walk away then stops and looks at Cameron

EXT ROOFTOP MUNICIPAL BUILDING - CLOSE ON CHUCK - MINUTES LATER

CHUCK
(pained)
Can you imaging Eli doing a World
War I picture without horses Do
you know the gags I could do with
four runaway horses pulling a
caisson

Cameron sailing into the SHOT Chuck ducks slightly catching
Cameron on his back and flipping him into a somersault Cameron
lands on the sharply slanted slate roof of the municipal building
Chuck stands beside him straddling the peak The church steeple can

be seen in bg

(and we now realize time has passed and we are no

longer in the graveyard of the previous sequence but atop the

building)
64A

- 34 -

CHUCK (CONTD)
-Next time hit me higher

CAMERON
(climbing to his feet)
Whats Eli got against horses I
love horses

CHUCK
Dont butter me up

Cameron goes running at Chuck and once again flies over his
shoulder Sprawling on the slippery slate he looks up to see Chuck
strolling down the hazardous incline like a mountain goat Cameron
scrambles to follow

CHUCK

(as he walks)
Well draw a sight line for you to
follow down the roof here while
youre rolling Now theres nothing
very difficult But this is where
you gotta think Your mind cant be
on snatch Its gotta be on
grabbing that gutter

They have reached the lower edge of the roof Cameron looks down at
the drop

CAMERON
Or my brains are all over the
pavement again right

CHUCK
(walking away)
You know a good falling horse makes
more money in four minutes than a
bank president does in a year

CAMERON
Pictures not over Maybe youll
still get your chance

Chuck has stopped and they peer down through a skylight to where the
crew is setting up a shot in a room below

CHUCK
(sadly)
Naw all they care about is story
- 35 -

They move to another edge of the roof overlooking a NARROW CENTRAL
COURTYARD They gaze down at a WINDOW AWNING two stories below that
juts from the side of the building-wing across the court

CHUCK (CONTD)
Now heres where the scuffle ends
When the pipe breaks loose you fall
and hit that awning Then Eli yells
cut and old Raymond takes your
place for the close-ups and the
glory Thats where the German
soldiers catch him and throw him in
the nuthouse Theyre shootin that
scene downstairs now

CAMERON
(staring at awning)
Thats supposed to hold me
Probably doesnt hold rain

CHUCK
Its not a real awning its a
catcher

EXT MUNICIPAL BUILDING ROOF - CLOSE ON CAMERON - DAY

Camerons face is beginning to sweat and the veins are bulging from
the growing strain of some physical effort

CHUCKS VOICE
Its no harder up here than it is on
the ground

CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal Cameron dangling from a section of rain
gutter four stories above the ground

CHUCKS VOICE (CONTD)
Its the same gagits just a
little scarier And thats what you
get paid for

CAMERON
(alert)
Yeah how much

CHUCK
Youre stealing candy with this gag
You get six hundred bucks

CAMERON
(almost fallina)

- 36 -

Jesus

CHUCK
---Christ Watch it will ya
(helping Cameron onto

roof )
What did you think a stunt man is
Hes a professional If the camera

jams thats another six hundred and
if Eli says try it again six
hundred more

CAMERON
(exultantly)
Yahooo Six-fucking-hundred-bucks

INT MUNICIPAL BUILDING - ASYLUM SET

In a large vacant hall on the ground floor of the municipal
building a movie set has been erected representing the ward room in
a World War I military asylum In it Elis crew is filming a
sequence -- a dozen enraged INMATES in tatters heads shaven wild-
eyed advance toward Raymond shrieking (as though in echo of
Camerons exultant yell)

CLOSER ANGLE

Raymond dressed as a British Flyer his face bloodied crouches and
retreats in terror a man caught in a nightmare as these mutilated
derelicts suddenly swarm over him One like a mad dog goes fro
his throat another wields his own artificial limb as a club
Raymond (in character) breaks free and screams

RAYMOND
--STOPGet away
For an instant the inmates stop in stunned silence -- broken only

by a distant shout overhead

CAMERONS VOICE
(on the roof overhead)
-Six-fucking-hundred gorgeous
beautiful dollars I cant believe
it

The slavering madmen look up then out at the camera madmen no
longer simply bewildered actors

ELIS VOICE
All right Hold it Hold it
- 37 -

ANGLE ON CREW

Eli stands amidst the camera crew photographing the scene He is
waving for order

ELI
--Save it everybody

AD
(storming in)
Jesus Christ what the hell was
that Somebody get their ass up on
that roof

ELI
(cutting him off)
-Never mind I didnt like it
anyway

As Eli steps down from the DOLLY a solemn quiet man approaches him
from among the onlookers It is SAM BAUM (the writer)

SAM
Whats wrong

ELI
The scenes wrong
(yells to the AD)
Call a break

The AD Calls Five minutes and the crew moves toward the coffee
urn Eli wanders toward the door Sam pursuing

SAM
(fighting for his scene)
Eli it played like a dream My
God it was Marat-Sade

ELI
(glumly )
It played like shit

- 38 -

SAM
(desperate)

Well who was that on the phone in
the middle of the night when you
first read it raving about the
magical madhouse scene the upstairs

maid

Eli rips the page with the madhouse
they stride out of the building

EXT MUNICIPAL BUILDING

scene from his screenplay as

There beside the rear entrance on a pile of construction sand sits
Eli cross-legged staring morosely at some kids who play nearby
He is absently folding a torn script page into a paper airplane

Behind him at a respectful distance

stand the Production Manager

AD half a dozen assorted crew chiefs and Sam Baum all looking

concerned Sam looks at the others

shrugs and approaches Eli

squatting beside him on the sand pile

SAM

What do you wanna do Eli

Theyre all waiting

While Sam talks Eli takes a fistful of sand and pours it in Sams
shoe Suddenly noticing Sam yanks his foot away

SAM (CONTD)

(irritated)
Being childish isnt

going to help

your movieYou know theres
nothing wrong with the story
(removing his shoe and

shaking the sand

out)

The real problem is since I wrote

this thing two years

ago youve had

Watergate the energy crisis
Womens Lib the economy is down the
tubesYou want to talk about
burning issuesTheres arsenic in

the glue on the back
Thats why you dont

of food stamps
like the

madhouse scene Your goddamn war
story has lost its relevance

ELI

Dont be negative Sam We can
start a new one in time for the

preview

- 39 -

Sam has finished replacing his shoe and Eli pours a fistful of sand
into Sams other shoe

SAM
Cut it out will ya

INT HOTEL DINING ROOM - THAT NIGHT

Eli is at the head of a long table CAMERA PULLING BACK TO REVEAL a
dozen members of the company dining with him Nina sits beside Eli
listening with rapt attention to Sams monologue her dessert fork
sensuously lingers at her lip

SAM
Two years ago you were all charged
up to make a great big anti-war
statement and they wouldnt let you
Now they let you but you havent
got a war What youve got is egg
on your face because Vietnams long
gone and its too late

ELI
Our pictures not about fighting
wars

SAM
Oh

ELI

---Its about fighting windmills

The truth in Elis statement registers on Sam Cameron sits farther
down the table watching Nina watch Eliand wishing she were
watching him

ELI
War isnt the diseaseIts only
one of the symptoms

SAM
(hooked)
Whats the disease
- 40 -

ELI

Thats the big question Sam Name
the disease and youve licked the
screenplay

(indicating Cameron)
Ask him â€˜Cause he knows what the
film is about Right Lucky Tell
â€˜emHowd you like Vietnam

CAMERON
Howd you like bubonic plague

ELI
You drafted

CAMERON
No

ELI
See Sam Heres another one who
hates warbut he enlisted
(to Cameron)
You fought in Vietnam for two years
--I mean actually were out there
killing people

CAMERON
-Hey I didnt kill that many
people

ELI

Dont be modest Lucky Everybody
digs a little violenceWhat was
that you said on the beach

Cameron is starting to bristle at Elis needling particularly with
Nina watching

CAMERON
About what

ELI
About getting home for Thanksgiving

CAMERON
(tentatively)
ethat you better figure the guy
coming at you is trying to kill
you

ELI
- 41 -

Yeah See SamThats what the
disease is aboutbeing scared
shitless Inventing enemies
Whistling in the dark I wish youd
talk to the kid Sam I mean it

You know really you guys should
room together

SAM
(getting the last word)
Hey Lucky give me your cot by the
window and Ill let you read a great
madhouse sequence

They all laugh

SAM

(surrendering)
All right Eli I1l write you
another scene What difference does
it make The studio will cut it all
out anyway and what you got left is
a lot of swell battle scenes which
when I was back there they said were
just terrific

ELI
(simply)
No they wont

SAM
Yeah what makes you different

ELI
(quietly)
Because they know if they cut my
picture Ill kill â€˜em

The deadly in Elis voice was more than intended and there is
suddenly an awkward silence at the table Cameron eyes Eli with a
wry smile

CAMERON
You mean bang Kill â€˜em just like
that
- 42 -

ELI
(matter of fact)
No Ill kill â€˜em and eat â€˜emI
hate to waste anything

SAM
(laughs)
They call him Eli the Terrible

ELI
Sam my picture is the only kid Ive
got If the studio said your
daughter Jennifer would look
better with her fingers chopped off
what would you do

SAM
Being an insecure writer Id call
my agentand get another opinion

Everyone laughs

Jake the Chief of Police is seen in the background approaching the
table Cameron spots him and starts to rise

CAMERON
-If youll excuse me

JAKE
(arriving)
Dont go away Burt I want you

ELI
(broad welcome )
Jake Long time no see You taken
care of my problem with the beach

JAKE
Im not talking to you
(to Production Manager)
I understand you got that film out
of the Duesenberg

ELI
(cutting in)
Its at the lab Jake

- 43 -

JAKE
Im talking to this gentleman
(to Production Manager)
We want to see it

Cameron realizing the film might disclose his presence on the
bridge reacts with alarm which increases as Eli says

ELI
Tell the Chief its our pleasure
Soon as it gets backbut ask him
why

JAKE

(choked up with its

importance)
You can tell your Mr Cross this
inquiry comes from a source so high
it is not his to question

(now at a loss for proper

words )
-it is his to do it or else
Someone theyre looking for may have
been on that road when the car went
off

(to Cameron)
Burt you see anybody

Then suddenly noticing something different about Camerons
appearance

JAKE (CONTD)
Hey did you have red hair
before

CAMERON
(indicating Denise)
She sprays it every day so I look
like RaymondI didnt see a soul

ELI
(to the rescue)
Tell the Chief that Burt was so busy
being brilliant he wouldnt have
noticed Jesus Christ walking on the
water

Jake pulls a PHOTOGRAPH from a manila envelope and hands it to
Cameron

INSERT PHOTOGRAPH
- 44 -

A wire photo front and side views of Cameron taken at his military
induction War ages a manhe looks younger and quite different in
his GI Haircut

ELI (VO)
Hey Burt You got it upside down
The eyes go on top

ANOTHER ANGLE
Cameron hands the photo back to the Chief who passes it around the
table Denise receives the photograph studies it and glances up at
Cameron expressionless He returns her gaze
JAKE (VO)

A couple of telephone linemen say

they saw him headed this way
Eli takes the photograph

ELI
Looks like a nice clean-cut kid

JAKE
I know about fifty guys who dont
think so

ELI

Whatd he do

JAKE
(to Production Manager
ignoring Elis question)
The minute that film gets here you
give me a call

CAMERON
(yawning and rising)
I dont know about those fifty guys
but I know one weary guy whos gonna
crawl upstairs and hit the sack

Eli looks at Cameron with grudging admiration
GABE
I know a weary guy whos driving to
Cape Long to dance and booze all

night

RAYMOND

45 -

(camping takes Gabes

hand)
I know a weary gay whos going with
him

They mince off (the fag act all the more amusing because of
Raymonds strictly masculine looks) Eli shouts after them

ELI
So long as youre back in ninety
minutes Its a work night for some
of us
(loftily)
-Those who give a shit

Raymond gathers Nina along the way wrapping his arm about her
shoulders -- Cameron watching silently Then charging from across
the dining room like a tanker steaming in their wake comes a
gushing overwrought blue-rinsed MATRON

MATRON
Miss Franklin Miss Franklin Your
Feminique Spray commercial is on
TV My God its simply heavenly

INT CAMERONS HOTEL ROOM - CLOSE ON DRESSER - NIGHT

Drawers are slamming open and shut as Cameron hurriedly stuffs his
few belongings into his pockets

WIDER ANGLE

Its a mean little bedroom with Sams clothes typewriter etc in
evidence Seeing Sams wallet Cameron pulls a wad of money from
it at the same time accidentally knocking Sams false teeth off the
dresser He hesitates then stuffs back all the bills but a twenty
He strides to Sams closet pulls out shirt and slacks stuffs them
in a cloth beach bag also belonging to Sam and starts out the door
Then he stops gets on his hands and knees looking for the false
teeth which he finally finds Now annoyed at himself for being a
nice guy he throws them carelessly on the dresser and quickly
exits

- 46 -

EXT HOTEL - LATER THAT NIGHT

As Cameron moves down the steps the returning company STATION WAGON
pulls to a stop in the driveway Nina Raymond and a few others
emerge from the car Cameron turns away so as not to be seen as
they pass him on the steps heading for the entrance

DENISE
Bet theyre looking for that nut who
killed all those campers in Montana

RAYMOND
(drunk )
--TOO many campers weed â€˜em out
-Imagine sitting an hour at a
roadblock

NINA
We should have waited it wouldnt
have been an hour

Theyve entered the hotel Cameron continues to the bottom of the
stairs hesitates looking back at Nina

CAMERONS POV

Silhouetted through the etched glass doors (on the other side of
The Looking Glass) he sees the lithe gay exquisitely beautiful
figure of Nina -- light sparkling from the cut glass dances about
her face -- a hauntingly romantic image

ANGLE ON CAMERON

He watches for a moment with hopeless longing Finally turning
from her he looks about at the dark water and deserted boardwalk
There come some of Elis crew laughing joking cutting a swatch
through the stillness pushing their heavy brutes toward some nearby
spot to light a night shot Theres the CHURCH TOWER He stares at
it wavering in his resolve to leave wondering what would happen
if

NINAS VOICE
What next Do you rescue the maiden
from the tower

She has come up behind him unnoticed He turns startled and
there she stands
- 47 -

CAMERON
(smiles)
Hi
For a moment they search each others eyes -- for intentions Then
she glances at the tower
NINA

Yes It does look pretty high
(with concern)
Are you worried about tomorrow

Camerons mind is racing over all the things hed like to say so she
would know him instantly But his answer is simple and sounds
sincere

CAMERON
Not much I guess if there were any
real danger Eli wouldnt let me do
it would he

NINA
(quickly reassuring)
No Im sure its safe

CAMERON
(abruptly with a boyish
grin)
Good Then you jump

NINA
(laughing)
Okay

She understands the slightly jealous rebuke for her blind faith in
Eli Her laughing answer hangs like a challenge

CAMERON
Well come on

NINA
(willing but flustered)
What right now
For a moment he weighs it whether to run or stay Then acts on
his decision Starting to laugh he takes her hand and pulls her
toward the tower She holds back struggling playfully

- 48 -

NINA (CONTD)
Wait Im afraid of heights What
if I freeze up

CAMERON
(pulling her along)
Dont worry Ill give you a push
Isnt that what a pals for

INT BELL TOWER - NIGHT

It is crowded with bells a small walkway and railing surrounded
them The city lights are seen beyond Below are the sheds where
crewmen are preparing the next days shooting Just beyond is the
overwhelming silhouette of the huge CRANE Nina and Cameron reach
the top of the stairs winded and laughing as they rush to the
railing and lean over Nina gasps clutching Cameron in genuine
fright

NINA
(gasps)
Oh my God Its terrifying You
cant jump from thisyoull get
killed Its crazy

CAMERON
(laughing)
--Its not that bad It looks
worse at night Chuck says its

like robbing a candy store
NINA
(getting angry)
Now stop that Im going back
She whirls to go He stops her taking her by the shoulders

CAMERON
--Whats wrong

Her concern for him has turned to anger like a mother slapping her
child for running in the street

NINA
Its just dumbto strut around

trying to talk brave

His arm still restrains her She takes hold of it then suddenly
softens with a look of slight surprise

NINA (CONTD)

49 -

Ohyou are scaredarent you

CAMERON
(seriously)
Not really

NINA
Yes You areYoure trembling

After a moment he answers quietly

CAMERON
So are youand youre not even
gonna jump

Its true She is trembling and so is he -- not from fear He
slowly draws her toward him her mouth reaching up to his And then
they are devouring each other Abruptly theyre illuminated by a
fierce blast of white light They separate and stare blinking in
shock and confusion

ELI (VO)
Okay hit two and three

They are pinned in the crossbeams of two more giant arcs Quickly
she yanks him down with her out of sight behind the railing

EXT CHURCHYARD - ELI AND CREW - NIGHT

Eli is lounging in the bucket suspended from the crane Beside him
Gabe adjusts one of the giant brutes

GABE
(business as usual)
I could kill this brute and fill
with juniors Youd get a halo
around the tower

ELI
(struggling to resist)
Got no timeits an establishing

shottwo seconds on the screen
(giving in)
--You got six minutes

Gabe smiles scurries off Eli glances at the tower grins having
toyed with them long enough he yells

- 50 -

ELI
Hey While youre up there be
useful Were lighting Stand up
and look towards the sea so youre
in profile

CLOSER ANGLE ON TOWER - NIGHT
As Ninas arm raises into view with the middle finger extended

NINA (VO)
(hollering)
Light this Eli

EXT CHURCHYARD - BENEATH THE TOWER - NIGHT

The church door swings open Nina and Cameron emerge covering
their embarrassment with bravado Nina is prattling as though to a
tour guide

CLOSE ON CAMERON AND NINA

NINA
-And those bells are so
interesting Imagine four hundred
years ago by boat from Amsterdam
Thank you for the tour It was so
informative Im going to write my
father Hes so interested in God
and things like that

ELIS VOICE
Hiya Want a lift

Eli miraculously appears from above He descends and rides around
beside them in the bucket of the crane

NINA
(ducking)
Oh for Christs sake

ELI
There once was a maiden fair
smooching a guy with red hair

NINA
Eli get away with that thing
-51-

ELI
---Could it be Raymond whos turning
this dame on Or his double

young Lucky Pierre

Unable to elude Eli in his basket Nina turns on him in mock
frustration

NINA

Its gotten to the point where I
have to look under the stopper of
the bathtub when I take a shower to
make sure Ive got some privacy

(broadly gesturing to

group)
Thank you one and all and good
night

Privately she gives Camerons arm an affectionate squeeze then
disappears around the corner of the building He is left holding
the beach bag pursued by the Peter Pan in the basket It has now
dropped to ground level so Eli is looking up at Cameron

ELI
Step right in folksthe Killer
Crane ride of the century

CAMERON
Thanks Ill walk

Elis basket now moves up a few feet so hes looking down at
Cameron riding beside him while he walks

ELI
Ah youth Six hours in town and
caught with the leading lady Not

CAMERON
Okay to be upset about what happened

He pulls Cameron into the basket beside him so unexpectedly that
Cameron drops Sams bag Eli picks it up and plops it into
Camerons lap Suddenly Cameron finds himself soaring skyward at a
stomach-churning rate -- while Eli rattles onprobing disarming
quixotic

ELI (CONTD)
You constantly amaze me You dont
go to movies Whats that tatoo a
disguise You a Commie Dont you
know that King Kong was only three
feet tall He came up to Fay Wrays
belly button If God could only do
the tricks we can What are you
worried about the film and the cop
for

Now hanging ten stories above the city Eli is adjusting his
viewer looking at a cluster of RED FLASHING LIGHTS IN THE DISTANCE
He hands the viewer to Cameron who looks through it

We see a telescoped view of THE POLICE ROADBLOCK at the end of a
highway with cars waiting to get past ARMED POLICE

CAMERONS VOICE
(muttering)
What am I worried about the cops
for

ELIS VOICE
Another one over there

THE VIEW WHIPS to a second police roadblock at the other entrance to
town

ELIS VOICE (CONTD)
Its a pair

TWO SHOT

CAMERON
(puts viewer down)
Is this my present

ELI
No your present is a piece of good
advice

CAMERON

Keep it
- 53 -

ELI

(patting Sams beach bag)
Youve got that look again That
gleam of the sprinter about to set a
record for the 50-yard dash Is
that why all those cops are chasing
you What are you some kind of sex
freak running across America with
your fly open Is that why theyre
after you

CAMERON
Youre close Whats your advice

ELI
Button your fly and be at the
airport on Sunday at three oclock
with the rest of the crew Climb
aboard our chartered 707 and fly
away with us to where the setting
sun bleeds into a million swimming
pools a man can hide in You do
swim as well as run

CAMERON
(overwhelmed by the
offer)
Ill swim like a fish You really
mean it
(Eli nods)
Why are you trying to save my ass

Eli hesitates then answers quietly -- for him there is great
meaning in it

ELI

-Because youre as crazy as the
guy Im doing the picture about

(then grinning archly

the mood broken)
--Besides Ive fallen madly in
love with the dark side of your
nature

EXT CHURCH TOWER - NEXT MORNING - BRIGHT DAYLIGHT

The thunderous clang of bells Cameron ready coiled tight heart
pounding as loud as the bells A burst of machine gun bullets tears
through the railing beside him sending splinters flying against his
face

CAMERA CREW

HARVEY (Second Unit Director) and CAMERA OPERATOR behind the
MITCHELL looking up tensely Harvey gestures yelling

HARVEY
Now

IN BELL TOWER

Near Cameron the SECOND AD crouched out of sight with a walkie-
talkie stabs a finger at him

SECOND AD
GoGo

A burst of tracer bullets streak past Cameron Sparks fly as stray
bullets seem to bounce and ricochet off the bells

MACHINE GUN

A 50-calibre MACHINE GUN a SPECIAL EFFECTS MAN in Levis and sport
shirt pumping tracers past the bell tower

TWO SHOT - BELL TOWER

The Second AD slams his hand down on a PLUNGER setting off a
series of explosive squibs Like machine gun bullets they start
shattering the railing moving toward Cameron forcing him to the
edge of the tower

Vaulting over the rail he clings to the side of the bell tower
Explosive bursts disintegrate the railing in his hand He shoves
out launching himself into space Twisting hurtling across the
gap between the buildings falling crashing to the slate roof
crawling and scrambling for a hand hold The relentless tracer
bullets chip the slate beside him Crouching low Cameron like an
animal moves across the roof to the safety of a water tower
Squibs burst over his head and spouts of water stream from the
tower

- 55 -

Moving around the tower suddenly there are TWO GERMAN SOLDIERS
running at him with bayoneted rifles He wheels and there stands
ANOTHER GERMAN (Chuck) who leaps toward him slamming down his
rifle butt The blow glances off Cameron They grapple kicking
clawing rolling down the steep slope picking up momentum

RAIN GUTTER

The roofs edge rushes toward them below it a fearsome drop
Camerons hands reach out desperately grabbing for the railing as
Chuck screaming hurtles off the edge writhing as his body tumbles
in space toward the ground

CAMERON

Sweat pouring from his face a gash on his cheek gushes blood his
eyes glazed he pulls himself back on the roof

CATCHER
Chuck lying relaxed on the straw and mattress safety pad which
caught him on the ground looks up cups his hands and shouts at

Cameron

CHUCK
GoGo

ROOF

Cameron running for his life along the edge of the roof the
soldiers shooting down at him from the roofs peak He reaches the
far end looks down There is the awning jutting from an adjacent
wall two stories below He scrambles off the roof Clinging to the
down spout he starts descending it

SPECIAL EFFECTS MAN

Looking up from the ground he yanks a control rope

CAMERON

The bracket holding the down spout breaks loose The spout starts

to fall away from the side of the building Cameron clings to it
riding its downward arc as though it were a falling tree

- 56 -

AWNING

At the end of the arc Cameron throws himself free for a safe
landing and smashes against the awning Instead of holding it rips
apart like paper and in that unexpected instant Camerons eyes
widen in genuine terror as he plummets through the shredded canvas
toward a skylight one floor below

SKYLIGHT

Exploding in a shower of glass and wood as it is struck by Camerons
body He hurtles downward toward a blur of images

ANGLE ON COT

Collapsing from the impact of Camerons fall The MAN and WOMAN who
were making love on the cot have been flung to the ground and roll
entwined with him Cameron is dazed Like a drowning man he rages
to free himself from the tangle of naked limbs and smothering flesh
A painted face shrieks in laughter -- as the door to the room he is
in is thrown open revealing

BROTHEL SET â€” INT MUNICIPAL BUILDING

Cameron has fallen into a cubicle in what appears to be a World War
I German army brothel In the high-ceilinged room there is a row
of cots separated by makeshift screens COUPLES jump up from the
cots startled A line of partly naked GERMAN SOLDIERS waiting their
turn at the whores have broken into shouts and laughter at Camerons
unorthodox entrance They crowd around the cubicle where Cameron
fell and now struggles with the couple

ANGLE ON CAMERA CREW
Gabe at the EYE PIECE Eli beside him photographing the scene
ELI
Keep rolling
(calling out to soldiers)
The clothesDo the clothes
ANGLE ON CAMERON
The men tear him free from the couple shouting playfully
ONE MAN

(dialect)
What are you a field marshal
-57 -

SECOND MAN
(dialect)
Wait your turn like the rest

Camerons confusion changes to helpless fury as he kicks and
struggles against a forest of grasping hands ripping his clothes
away passing him back toward the rear of the line

THIRD MAN
(dialect)
Where are your manners

WHORE
(dialect)
This is a whorehouse not a stable

Whores have left their cots to join in the assault screeching in
glee As he maniacally lashes out at his good-natured molesters
the blood from Camerons face smears a whores body

ELIS VOICE
Cut

Instantly everything stops Cameron is sprawled half-naked on his
knees at the end of the line Enraged he whirls toward Eli who has
caused this humiliation Then the CLAPPING begins the CAST and
CREW applauding his stunt People slap him on the back admiringly
A robe is thrown around him He is helped to his feet Suddenly
Nina is there flinging her arms about him and kissing him on the
mouth

NINA
Im so proud of youI could just
die

He is pulled away from her by the backslappers Now Cameron is
responding to this strange new sensation -- the warmth of public
acclaim He regains his poise hoping his embarrassing anger wasnt
noticed Chuck is now beside him reaching up to the wound on
Camerons face and pulling away the plastic makeup patch with fake
blood inside the wound is gone He starts feeling Camerons
shoulders arms and ribs for possible damage

CAMERON
(quietly to Chuck
wincing in pain)
Why didnt you tell me about the
awning I could have been killed

- 58 -

CHUCK
No chance You were in your
mothers arms from the time you hit
the sugarglass skylight Those
stunt men you fell on would have got
you out of anything

CAMERON
Stunt men

CHUCK
The one with the tits and the other
guy

CAMERON

Why didnt you tell me Afraid Id
chicken out

CHUCK
Eli likes some things spontaneous
Makes em more believable Youre
okay Whaddya want

CAMERON
Not to think Im going crazy

ANGLE ON ELI
He is moving through the crowd

ELI
(yelling)
Wheres Raymond Raymond were you
watching that closely

RAYMOND
(appearing)
What can I tell you Ima brave

There is general laughter Eli raising his arm like a referee
ELI

Eli continues toward Cameron Chuck is spraying ethyl chloride on

his bare tattooed shoulder

ELI (CONTD)

Careful Dont blind the eagle

CAMERON
(acknowledging the
compliment )
If anything bothered you be happy
to do it again

Eli laughs and moves off Cameron staring after him

ANGLE ON SAM

Approaching Eli

CAMERON
(to Chuck)
I cant take my eyes off the son-of-
a-bitch Everybody does what he
wants them to even me I feel like
thankin him cause I fell on my
ass

CHUCK
(sarcasm)
--Its just a crush Youll get

who turns to Sam eager vulnerable

ELI
What did you think

SAM
You are a smug insufferable son-of-
a-bitch When I read the insane
asylum scene to my wife and four
children my wife cried my oldest
son shook my hand for the first time
in his whole life So why is it
Eli that this vulgar little scene
turns out to be so muchstronger
more moving
- 60 -

ELI

(touched)
God knows Sam Maybebecause you
get the feeling that the enemy might
just be some poor horny slob like
you lookin for the nearest
whorehouse

(putting his arm around

Cameron)
How about that Lucky When that
stunt mans boob hit you in the
mouth was it just another boobor
did it taste like kraut

The crew laughs and so does Nina Cameron feels humiliated by Elis
patronizing tone

CAMERON
It tasted lousy But what do I
know You try it Eli Youre the
expert in bad taste

ELI
(for the group)
Uh-oh sounds like the soldiers got
his feelings hurt

CAMERON
Naw naw I just dont know about

100 INT HOTEL GARAGE - CLOSE ON ELI

As though continuing previous dialogue

ELI
(genially)
Oh is that why the cops are after
you After all this time
CAMERON
(sarcastic)

Damn You finally guessed it

100A WIDER ANGLE

Revealing Eli and Cameron walking through the hotel GARAGE toward a
replica of the lost Duesenberg which a MECHANIC works on

ELI
100B

-61-

--Really Rape No I think
youre putting me on Come on now
no more hints
(he thinks)
Lets seeChrist could be
anything I know a guy in this
state got 20 years for having
cunnilingus with his wife
(studies Cameron)
NoI guess youre not the type
More likely some hideous crime of
violence

Eli is getting under Camerons skin They stop at car

ELI
(to mechanic)
Have you seen Harvey

MECHANIC
I think hes in there

Mechanic nods toward a door at the rear of the garage Eli pats the
fender of the Duesenberg Cameron views it with a strange sense of
unease Putting his arm around Camerons shoulder Eli leads him
toward the back door yelling to mechanic

ELI
Youll have it ready on time

MECHANIC
Yeah but dont look under the hood
or youll find a Chevy

At the door Eli can barely open it to squeeze through
INT STORAGE ROOM
An incredible number of people have wedged themselves into this tiny
smoke-filled room peering over each others heads toward a lighted
area at the far end

ELI

(shouting)
Harvey in here
- 62 -

OFFSTAGE VOICE
(yelling)
Quiet Were shooting
(then back to business)
Come onlet me have a little more
facea little more face

Eli squats on his haunches peering between the legs of the onlookers
and tugs on Camerons sleeve to join him

102 POV

Hazily through the restless shifting limbs male and female like
the first rays of morning sun breaking through to the depths of the
forest we glimpse Raymond and Gabe shooting their eight millimeter
epic Two people screwing in a rowboat Raymond suddenly throws
his hands up in despair

RAYMOND
(screaming)
Cut
(indignantly)
Jesus Kenneth Great control All
right whos doubling for Kenny on
the inserts

103 ANGLE ON ELI AND CAMERON
Cameron and Eli rise to their feet

ELI
Can you believe this They spend
the whole day working ina
whorehouse and look how they relax
Thats dedication You think sex
can save the world
(grins at Cameron)

CAMERON
Thatâ€™s not my bag Eli

ELI
Sex or saving the world

CAMERON
-The world thats your special
job And Jesus are we all lucky to
have you around

Suddenly Cameron is shoved backwards by the door as someone pushes
against it to get in

- 63 -

ANOTHER ANGLE
It is Harvey standing in the doorway with Nina

HARVEY
(to Eli)
Hey Chief ya lookin for me

Nina tries to peer over the heads of the crowd pushing into the
room Cameron steps toward her without thinking He wants her out
of there

NINA
Whats happening Whats going on

GABE
(joking)
Look whos here Nina we need you
Still got your makeup on

Nina who by now has seen whats happening laughs

NINA
Thats a daring touch Raymond The
rowboat Terribly symbolic

There is general laughter but not shared by Cameron He
surprisingly finds himself angry at Ninas presence here and
everyones easy familiarity toward her She sees Cameron and Eli
through the smokey dimness and works her way toward them smiling
Eli puts his arms about her shouting over the din

ELI
(kidding her)
Just like the old days huh kid
Remember the sunglasses and garter
belts back when we got our start
Make you nostalgic

More laughter Nina turns to Cameron

NINA
Hi Lancelot Whats a nice boy like
you doing in a place like this
Going to rescue the maiden from the
boat

ELI
He just asked if he could do the
rowina Didnt vou kid
- 64 -

CAMERON

Having fun with me arent you
Its Elis potty training class
Show little Lucky the pretty lady
Make dirt on the pretty lady Watch
little Lucky puke Trouble with you
is you think the whole world is your
own personal crapper

(Cameron starts to exit)
Have yourself a timeJust wallow
around in it man Watching you
makes me feel like Mr Clean

Cameron storms out in a rage Eli watches with a thoughtful smile
Sam who has witnessed the outburst turns to Eli furious

SAM
---Goddamn little prudish bastard

ELI
No more than you and meits the
human condition We just hide it
better

SAM

-Are you kiddingIf That guy in
the rowboat was a Marine sticking a
bayonet in her instead of a cock
that uptight son-of-a-bitch would
have saluted

Eli starts laughing

SAM (CONTD)
Fucking Fascist What are you
laughing at

ELI
Its justthat girl in the
rowboat she looks exactly like your
daughter Jennifer

SAM
(outraged)
Goddamn you Eli Thats not funny

He grabs Eli by the shirt front cocking his fist

ELI
(lauaghina and wrestlina)

- 65 -

Get em Sam Sic â€˜em Kill â€˜em
boy Thats my uptight killie
doggie

Sams anger fades to a sheepish grin realizing hes fallen into
Elis trap Where his daughter is concerned hes just as prudish
as Cameron Eli snaps an affectionate headlock around Sams neck

SAM
Son of a bitch

ELI
(still laughing)
See what I mean Old Victorias
still got us all by the balls God
save the queenOnly difference
is we like to make movies about it

With hardly a pause he turns

ELI (CONTD)
Harvey dailies at six oclock
tomorrow morning Were shooting at
seven

Rubbing his hands together (the old pro taking over) he starts
pushing his way through the crowd

ELI (CONTD)
All right now lets put a little
bit of class into this production
He elbows his way to center stage
INT BASEMENT SCREENING ROOM - NEXT DAY
On the folding chairs facing the PORTABLE SCREEN a dozen people are

silhouetted against the light from the projected dailies Cameron
enters pausing so his eyes can adjust to the dark

- 66 -

POV

In the dimness Nina sits separated from Eli Sam and a few others
On the screen a World War I British biplane in steady flight is
interrupted by a couple of subliminal cuts Another subliminal
flash holds and replaces the scene on the portable screen Its a
NUDIE SHOT -- a rear view of the lady taken in the rowboat the
night before

VOICE
What the hell is that

The watchers all break up recognizing the work of Raymond and Gabe

GABE
Hey Nina theres your toothpaste
commercial

RAYMOND

I love her smile

As Nina laughs good-naturedly the airplane is back on the portable
screen

ANGLE ON CAMERON

Involuntarily smiling to himself and now less uptight about last
night he walks over and sits down beside her

CAMERON
(whispering)
How they get the film developed so
fast

Without even glancing at him Nina gets up and moves to a chair some
distance away He is stunned then angry Then confounded Then
resigned to the ways of women he goes over and sits beside her

CAMERON
Whats the matter

NINA
(turning on him)
Dont let the fact that Eli treats
you as an equal go to your head
Youre not

CAMERON
Thanks

ELIS VOICE
-67 -

Nina were watching dailies

NINA
Im sorry Eli

CAMERON
But he can say anything and thats
okay

NINA

-Thats right

CAMERON
-Thats great

NINA
-What goes on in that dim little
head of yours How dare you open
your mouth to him like that Have
you the vaguest idea what hes
trying to say to people with this
filmThat man is the most
dedicated kindest

Elis voice interrupts angry like a schoolteacher dismissing a
child for talking

ELIS VOICE
Nina you can go now

Nina close to tears quickly gets up and hurries out of the
theater as Cameron sits there numbly staring at the screen

107A POV

On the portable screen Raymond in helmet and goggles is in the
cockpit of an airplane He stuffs a bottle of champagne into a
leather flying boot dangles the package over the side and lets it
go Raymond looks down and salutes (like that famous scene in
WINGS)

PRODUCTION MANAGERS VOICE
Who says nothin changes Like to
see one of our boys in a B-52 try
that

Elis voice yells â€˜cut on the sound track The angle on the
portable screen widens and we see that the airplane sits on the
ground with an electric fan blowing wind in Raymonds face
- 68 -

Now the scene on the portable screen changes from the ground we
see the same biplane flying low An object drops from the cockpit
(the boot) Then there is a burst of flame in the engine Trailing
smoke the plane wobbles crash-lands (sliding alarmingly close to
CAMERA) It ground-loops goes up on one wing and as it crashes
down we see that the pilot who we assumed was Raymond is really a
dummy that is flapping absurdly and falling to pieces before our
eyes during the crash There are groans laughter and raspberries

Something better than we got

ELI
Wilder crazier

(starting to shout)
Dropping a dead mans boots over his
own airfield out of chivalry

ELI

dummy was bored

PRODUCTION MANAGER
- 69 -

(anxiety at the breaking

point)
---Eli please You simply will not
accept the fact that we are living
on borrowed time

But Eli and Sam are not listening

ELI
You cant shake your finger at â€˜em
Sam If youve got something to
say you better slip it in while
theyre laughing and crying and
jacking off over the sex and
violence He should do
somethingoutrageous

SAM
(belligerent )
Like what

ELI
Something to catch the stink of
madness behind all that good clean
fun Why the hell did we pick World
War I in the first placeThe
ultimate romantic insanity

SAM
(shouting)
Like what

ELI
LikeI dont know what What
would Lucky do if he were on the
wing of that plane Picture that
because it would be a hell of a lot
realer than that flapping dummy

108 Cameron is startled He was not aware that Eli even knew he was in
the room

SAM
Is that what youre after reality
I thought you wanted something
outrageous
- 70 -

ELI
Reality can be pretty outrageous
Look at soldier boy there jumping
off fucking buildings risking his
ass every day doing stuff way over
his headWhat would you do in
that plane Lucky if you were about
to die

CAMERON
(off guard embarrassed)
What else Id dance for joyId
probably do a jig

ELI
Great Thats what well do

SAM

ELI
All right not a jiga
Charleston

SAM
A Charleston

ELI
--On the wing of the airplane

Youll get a laugh Eli

(SHOCK CUT TO SKY) - CLOSE ON GERMAN FIGHTER PLANE - DAY

It screams down vertically full power machine guns blazing then
smashes into the earth shredding to fragments hurled in every
direction The dead German pilot is flung crumpled to the ground
The planes carcass explodes filling the screen with fire and black
smoke through which we see a brightly colored PARACHUTE descending
The FIGURE dangling beneath it passes through the smoke and flames
and tumbles to the ground rolling his parachute now ablaze It is
Cameron dressed in a British flyers uniform

ANGLE WIDENS

To show the hand-held Arriflex at Gabes eye Eli behind him
steering Gabe by the back of his belt and carrying the battery pack
as they photograph Cameron shedding the harness With the camera
they crouch and move together like a three-headed four-armed four-
legged creature

Banking steeply a British fighter roars past Cameron its wingtip
almost brushing the ground machine guns rattling driving some
advancing German soldiers back toward the woods

The plane touches down to rescue Cameron the pilot beckoning
Cameron has pulled off the dead German pilots boots and helmet
Stray bullets strike about him as he sprints to the idling British
plane It is a single-seater It starts to pick up speed He
grabs a strut and scrambles up onto the lower wing

ANGLE ON CONSTRUCTION CRANE

The bucket hanging from the giant CRANE descends Smoothly Eli
guides Gabe backward seating him in the bucket The bucket rises
lifting Gabe while he photographs the scene as the plane with
Cameron on the wing becomes airborne

ANGLE ON PICKET FENCE
Behind it is a CROWD OF SPECTATORS who jump up and down shrieking

CAMERA PANS to show Nina among them her excitement hardly more
controlled

- 72 -

ANGLE ON CRANE BUCKET AND BRITISH AIRPLANE

The giant arm of the crane swings and rises with the plane
completing Gabes spectacular shot Now we see a HELICOPTER drop
into frame photographing the plane from the other side The
chopper and the vintage British plane bank together in perfect tight
formation with Cameron standing spread-eagled between the wing
struts like a flying Christ as they soar into the sun

ANGLE ON CAMERON

Seated on the wing his back against he fuselage legs firmly
against the struts His white silk scarf streams into the tearing
wind Jamming a champagne bottle into the Germans boot he holds
it up The pilot grins approval popping the cork on a second
bottle which spouts foam into the slipstream Laughing he passes a
glass to Cameron and pours from above The liquid is lost in the
wind Shrugging he swigs from the bottle and hands it to Cameron
Cameron drinks The champagne pours down his throat and face and
holding the strut with one hand he rises to his feet

The pilot waggles his wings giving Cameron a seesaw ride to get his
bottle back Cameron now seems drunk He lets go of the strut and
stands leaning against the wind As the pilot toasts his courage
Camerons balance falters and he grabs the strut

Now Cameron picks his way through the guywires toward the end of
the wing Then he bounces up and down rocking the plane The
pilot starts to sing to Camerons rhythm How ya gonna keep â€˜em
down on the farm And Cameron dances the Charleston

INT HELICOPTER

Gabe at the eyepiece of the Mitchell slowly tilting up and down to
follow the action

GABE
Fan-fucking-tastic Whaddya been
feeding that soldier-boybrave
pills

Through the plastic bubble the biplane can be seen in the distance
going through its antic maneuvers

ELI
Its not what hes eatingits
whats eating himthat makes it
sort of interesting
(through intercom)
Okay drop the package

-73-

CLOSE ON BIPLANE

Cameron holds the boot poised lets go Then the pilot is struck
by a bursting shell As he slumps over the plane skids and slips
and drops off into a spin Cameron clings for his life as the
sickening momentum grows until his feet are flung out from under
him and he dangles from the wing whipping in space

WIDE ANGLE

Suddenly it becomes clear how what we are seeing is possible -- the
airplane is no longer in flight but is dangling a few feet above
the ground suspended from the cable of the huge crane The crewmen
shove at its tail and wingtips to keep it revolving Cameron is
indeed clinging to the wing strut his feet held in space by the
centrifugal force But if his hands slip he will fall ten feet
instead of to certain death

ANGLE ON ELI AND CAMERA CREW - SHOOTING FROM GROUND

ELI
How is it

GABE
(panning and tilting)
Su-fucking-perlative
ELI
(into walkie-talkie)
Okay now level out
ANGLE ON CRANE OPERATOR
Easing some levers back

POV THROUGH LENS

As the spin slows down and the plane appears to level out Cameron
regains his footing perches on the wing and looks forward in
growing horror

WIDER ANGLE

As the swinging arm of the crane glides the plane forward toward a
stand of trees at the edge of a clearing

PAST CAMERON - MOVING SHOT

We see the rapidly approaching trees Closer and closer until with
a horrendous crash the plane sails between two trunks shearing off
the wingtips the nose smashing into another hurling Cameron off
the wing like a crumb flicked from the table

EXTREME CLOSE UP - CAMERON

Apparently hurtling through the air his eyes widen at the impending
impact A gasp and then a sharp cry But instead of the
crashthe ANGLE WIDENS and we see it is Cameron reaching orgasm
With extreme contentment on his face he rolls over revealing Nina
who it is clear has also had a lovely time

WIDER ANGLE - INT NINAS HOTEL BEDROOM - NIGHT

They are in bed in a pleasant large room (the Queen Anne Suite)
untidy with script pages wigs costumes fresh flowers the
leftovers of a room service dinner Nina caresses his back
noticing bruises She kisses them gently and starts to giggle He
looks at her quizzically

NINA
Thats twice for me today Now
And when I watched you do the stunt

The ALARM CLOCK on the dresser BEGINS RINGING He sits up puzzled

NINA (CONTD)
I have to study my scene for
tomorrow The Old Lady at the
cemetery Its brutal I set the
clock in case we dozed off

Cameron gets up moving toward the dresser to turn off the clock
but instead stops at the stand holding the Old Lady wig He runs
his fingers through it as the clock continues to ring

CAMERON
How come they cast you as an old
lady

NINA

I start out as a young girl hiding
this American flyer Im Austrian
Will ya turn off the clock

Subtly we sense something is bothering Cameron He ignores the
still-ringing clock
- 75 -

NINA (CONTD)
Anyway his patriotism is stronger
than his love and he leaves me with
another little patriot in my belly

During this he has taken the wig and puts it over his head glancing
in the mirror

CAMERON
Why cant I double for both of you
I could use the money and I dont
look half bad

NINA
(seriously)
Honey youll ruin it Take it off

He does

NINA (CONTD)
The clocks electric Itll ring
forever

Instead of turning off the clock he crosses to the Old Ladys dress
on a hanger He looks at the dress appraisingly

CAMERON
Eli might really go for that the
big soldier as a little old lady

Disturbed Nina leaves the bed turns off the alarm clock and
adjusts the wig properly on its stand

NINA
Whats wrong

CAMERON
Everythings beautiful

They embrace and cling to each other She starts back for the bed
but he detours for the clock and pulls out the alarm again and
again it BEGINS RINGING

NINA
What are you doing
-76-

CAMERON
Weve got to consider Eli If you
dont study the scene hell be
madthen youll get madand I1l
get shot out of a cannon

With the alarm still ringing he starts toward the bed

NINA
Did you fall on your head today

CAMERON
I want it to ring

NINA
Why

CAMERON
For me thats why Thats Eli
yelling for you to work on your
scene and us saying Up yours
Eli and I like that

NINA
Do you want to leave

CAMERON
I want to make love to you while Eli
is screaming his head off

The whole idea is so incongruous that she starts laughing He gets
on the bed with her THE ALARM CONTINUES TO RING They struggle
about giggling at the absurdity

NINA
I cant make love with the clock
ringing

CAMERON

While he moves over her body she grabs a pillow and hurtles it at
the clock It falls over but keeps on ringing By now Cameron
has entered Nina and she is rapidly becoming more involved in that
than in the clock

making love to Nina)

CLOSE ON MOVIOLA

In the darkness the machine is like an ominous hunchback
splattering shards of light against Chucks intensely watching face
He is highly disturbed at the unseen image

CHUCK
(to himself)
Crazy bastard

ANGLE WIDENS showing a small STORAGE ROOM has been converted to a
makeshift EDITING ROOM where Chuck sits working the MOVIOLA

Slowly becoming aware of someone he glances up through the spinning
reels and dimly sees Cameron leaning in the doorway

CHUCK
There was no way it could go
wrongunless he just went ape

Cameron ambles over as Chuck reverses the film to see it one more
time Even as he catches a glimpse of the film whirring backward
he realizes hes seeing BURTS DEATH SCENE in the water Now Chuck
has reached the beginning of the film and is moving it forward
again

CLOSE UP - VIEWER OF MOVIOLA
The film whirs as we see through the windshield over Burts
shoulder the car flying through the air hitting the water and
sinking beneath the surface Burt goes through the motions of a man
trying to free himself
CHUCK
The harness is okaythe roof is

holdingit all seems fine

CAMERON
But look at him struggle

CHUCK
---Badly Eli wouldnt use a foot
of itpoor slob died for nothinâ€™
ANOTHER ANGLE

Sweat is running down Camerons face Finally with dread

CAMERON
That crackin the windshield

CHUCK

- 78 -

What about it Probably from the
impact No water coming in

Camerons face reflects immense relief At least hes not guilty of
that The flung stone was not the cause Now abruptly Burts
body begins to move more violently

CHUCKS VOICE
There Look at that Hes starting
to panic Will you for Christs
sake tell me why

As Chuck slows the film we see Burts head duck beneath the view of
the underwater camera leaving only the steering wheel and
windshield For an instant the current changes the light and the
crack glows brightly like a spider web Burt reappears his face
now toward camera wild with terror The slow motion lends a
bizarre elegance to his agony Abruptly the FILM GOES BLACK

CHUCK
Shit Thats where it stops That
fuckin Henrygot spooked and took
his finger off the remote button

CAMERON
Is this how the story was supposed
to end with the flyer dying in the
water

CHUCK
Sure as shit ended that way for
Burt didnt it

INT REHEARSAL HALL - DAY

In one of the private DINING ROOMS off the lobby tables and chairs
are pushed against the wall to make room for a rehearsal now in
progress Some early morning TOURISTS have gathered outside the
entrance watching A few members of the kitchen staff peer through
an inside doorway Sam and key crewmen stand on the sidelines as
Eli rehearses with Nina
79 -

ELI

(gesturing)
The graveyards over here

(he takes a few steps)
-Her cars parked here

(sets down a folding

chair)
---Lots of these little graveyards
along the roadsidemost of the
stones are unmarked

He takes Nina by the hand and pulls her down beside him kneeling on
the floor

ELI (CONTD)
Youre tiredyoure brokeall
things which meant so much are gone
Whats left is a single memory
that brief bright love

Ninas listening intensely but something catches her eye Among the
tourists at the doorway stands Cameron who has paused to watch his
costume slung over his shoulder He nods to her with a small tender
smile Subtly so Eli wont notice she smiles back then renews
her concentration

ELI (CONTD)

Â»-You spent your months pension in
hiring the car You just cant look
for his grave any longerso you
pick oneany one You kneel
then lay the flowers down

(yells to the prop man)
What have we got for her

PROPERTY MAN
I got roses

ELI
Nosomething she picked herself

wildflowers or something

Sam crosses over to them and kneels beside Eli and Nina

- 80 -

SAM
(hesitantly)
Eli An idea maybe Instead of
flowers what if she brought him the
things of their life togetherof
their sexualitylike her
nightgown her underclothes

Eli looks at him thoughtfully

SAM (CONTD)
Course theyd be rags by now but
let me show you this

From a paper bag he takes a SMALL BRONZE CASTING of a BEAR and A
GIRL on a SWING beneath a tree He sets it down

INSERT ON THE BRONZE

Sams hand presses a lever on the side of the bronze There is a
whirring of the clockwork and a music box melody plays The girl
begins to swing The bear slides toward her She mechanically
lifts her bronze dress until they meet performing their clockwork
love rite Nina giggles

SAMS VOICE
Its authentic Early Victorian
Mechanical bronzes were quite a
thing
ANGLE ON GROUP
Eli shakes his head patiently kindly

ELI
Sam youll get a belly laugh

SAM
What do you mean Itll break their

hearts

Eli begins to beam Sam realizing he has again fallen into the
trap winces chagrined Eli grabs him in a bear hug

ELI
Welcome to the picture Sam

Sam struggles to escape from the iron grip as Eli dances him about
in joy

ACTOR

DENISES VOICE
(trimming his hair)
Youre confusedHe got it into her
in five minutes To get it out of
herit takes longer

There is general knowing laughter as Denise crosses back to Cameron
and sees by the look on his face she has hit her target The
thought of Nina and Eli as lovers had never occurred to Cameron

DENISES VOICE (CONTD)
Oopssomebody didnt know

The effect is stronger than she had expected Now compassion sets
in

DENISE (CONTâ€™D)
(softly)
Hey Cmon RedIm a woman

Cameron just sinks back in the chair slowly dying
EXT GRAVEYARD - CLOSE ON MECHANICAL BRONZE

Over the tinkling sound of the music box the BEAR and MAIDEN
perform their ritual as the CAMERA PULLS BACK revealing the
GRAVESTONE decorated with the worn filmy lace undergarments of
another era They flutter in the soft wind and amber light of a
summer afternoon strangely beautiful against the mossy granite
marked UNKNOWN Somehow these rotting womens underthings have
the dignity of a sacred tapestry draping an altar

OLD LADYS VOICE

-You terrible bear so
impatient tearing something so
beautiful

The ANGLE WIDENS and we see Nina now made up to look wrinkled and
gray tragically old her eyes moist as she kneels beside the grave
- 83 -

OLD LADY (NINA)

(sudden deep sincerity)
Why do I lie I couldnt wait
either I think both of us are
bears

(a soft nostalgic smile)
Go young maiden youll be late for
your piano lesson

An elegantly-dressed CARIBINERRI (ITALIAN POLICEMAN) appears

CARIBINERRI
Signorasignora

OLD LADY (NINA)
Im almost finished

CARIBINERRI
Signora This desecration some
flowers perhapswould be

permitted

OLD LADY (NINA)
But we want these

CARIBINERRI
Please signora Its not right
The grave is unmarked

OLD LADY (NINA)

Ask the driver how many graves we
visited today I could have chosen
five hours ago I came here and my
soul said Oh yes I know that is
hard to believe

CARIBINERRI
(shrugging)

Anything is possible signora
(tries urging her to her
feet)

Now you must permit me to escort

you to your car

OLD LADY (NINA)
As soon as I am gone you will take
everything away

CARIBINERRI
No
- 84 -

OLD LADY (NINA)

(tears streaming down her

face)
You will and I cant stop you and
its wrong We loved each other
Where else should these go

The unexpected sound of laughter makes her turn to see a SMALL GROUP
OF PEOPLE whove gathered beside their PARKED CARS watching

OLD LADY (NINA)
Yes I know Im ridiculous but you
laugh without knowing anything You
would buy a plastic wreath for a man
of such importance

She pulls free of the Caribinerri and trying to kneel down
stumbles and falls Now like some confused child she searches
among the garments Taking a SCROLL from a wooden box she shakes
it at them like a schoolteacher would a ruler

OLD LADY (NINA)
President Wilsonfrom the
President of the United Statesfor
heroism To me for sheltering
him

(smiling to herself)
How silly I sheltered him to be
with him He was my belovedWhere
is itOh here did you see this

She now holds up a fist from which dangles a swastika on a sash

OLD LADY (NINA)
Given to me by Adolf Hitlerfor
our son Our son

Her voice suddenly fierce with the pain of that memory

OLD LADY (NINA)
--Our son

(then with simple

reverence)

-A thousand years of peaceis
what he said That would be very
nice

The Caribinerri spellbound has taken a backward step bumping into
a REFLECTOR which now teeters and falls into the scene knocking
off his hat barely missing the Old Lady and crashing across the
arave and shattering all illusion The Caribinerri stands there

- 85 -

with his eyes closed and his fists clenched wishing he were in the
grave Nina stands in speechless horror

MEDIUM - CAMERON WATCHING ELI AND NINA EMBRACE

Everybody is applauding wild with joy over Ninas great
performance Tears of happiness run unabashedly down Sams nose
Only Cameron is sullen seething with anger and jealousy as he views
them in the light of his recent information

AD
(through bull horn)
All right that wraps the graveyard
Dont pack itjust stick it in the
truck Come on were losing sun
everybody In ten minutes at the
farmhouse

Cameron is standing aside while Nina vainly looks around for him
Denise is unpinning her wig Chuck approaches Cameron
- 86 -

CHUCK

Cameron still watching Nina and Eli in the now dwindling circle of
admirers doesnt answer

CHUCK
You know Eli Tell the soldier

CAMERON
Fine Eli Lets be brotherly
Milk brothers sucking from the same

ANGLE - EXT FARMHOUSE - DAY

As it explodes Cameron is BLOWN THROUGH THE WALL -- ON FIRE He
tumbles to the ground frantically writhes rolls trying to smother
the flames finally collapsing in some wagon tracks filled with
muddy water Cameron lifts his head at the approach of a THUNDERING
SOUNDan ENGLISH CAISSON hurtles toward him the driver dead and
mangled over the barrel of the gun the horses insane with terror
Before Cameron can move the charging horses are on top of him He
rolls between their hooves the giant steel wheel of the caisson
barely missing him Shells from a cannon barrage are bursting all
about Cameron staggers to his feet and scrambles over a low stone
wall for protection drops to the other side and then hurtles into
the air as the wall is shattered by an exploding shell

CLOSE ON TRAMPOLINE

As Cameron falls into the shot landing on a hidden TRAMPOLINE near
the stone wall bouncing up and down â€˜til he finally comes to rest

OFFSTAGE VOICE

ANGLE TO INCLUDE ELI AND CREW

ELI
Who said that

Cameron stares over the edge of the trampoline as Henry the
assistant cameraman uneasily faces Eli

HENRY
We had a film run-out

ELI
(to Gabe)
How many feet are left in that
camera

GABE
(checking the Mitchell)
Thirty-six feet

Eli advances murderously on the assistant cameraman building to a
rage we have not seen in him before

ELI
Goddamn you How many times are you
going to do this to me How dare
you yell cut on my set

- 88 -

HENRY
(defensively)
Thirty-six feet is nothing

ELI
Its twenty-two seconds In twenty-
two seconds I could break your
spineI could pinch your fucking
head off like an insect and smear it
on the pavementI could put
twenty-two bullets in that fat gut
of yours The only thing I cant
seem to do in twenty-two seconds is
keep you from fucking up my film

Cameron is so intrigued that he hasnt realized an EMBER is burning
through his asbestos protector until suddenly he feels the flame
and frantically begins beating it out and thus is even denied the
pleasure of savoring Elis anguish

EXTREME CLOSE UP - NINA (INT SAMS AND CAMERONS ROOM - NIGHT)

Rosy-faced and dewy-eyed and wearing a big floppy hat Sensing
trouble with Cameron and that she might be at fault she has decided
to do a campy cutesy Blanche Dubois stepping off THE STREETCAR
NAMED DESIRE number ten years too soon

NINA
(southern-belle sarcasm)
---I cant tell you how pleased I
was with your conduct When you
congratulated me after my scene this
afternoon all the other glowing
tributes faded to nothing

WIDER ANGLE - INT CAMERONS AND SAMS ROOM
Sam has stopped typing and sits silently waiting for the storm
Cameron lies on his bed in a T-shirt and shorts an elastic bandage

around his knee and an ice bag at his neck coldly watching Ninas
performance as she grandly moves through the doorway into the room
- 89 -

NINA (CONTD)
---Nevertheless Im cancelling your
invitation to an intimate party
given by my parents who arrived
unexpectedly to honor me on the
occasion of my birthdaybut dont
feel too badly As consolation for
a lovely evening missed Im
presenting you with the good-sport-
of-the-month award

From behind her back she takes an APPLE with a tiny cocktail
parasol stuck in it and holds it out to Cameron Cameron lies
glaring at her with mounting rage

NINA (CONTD)
Mr Baum will you notify this young
savage that its customary to cover
ones privates when accepting an
award Its one of the common
courtesies likecongratulating
people

CAMERON
(coldly)
What should I congratulate you for
The fucking scene or for fucking the
director

Nina stands there shaken looking at him sadly

NINA
For fucking the director honey
(biting into apple)
Didnt you know thats how little
girls get into the movies

She leaves Cameron lies there seething then abruptly leaps up and
storms into the bathroom Sam sits rubbing his head resumes
typing Cameron rages out of the bathroom flings himself onto the
bed Unwinding the elastic bandage he sprays ethyl chloride on his
knee Sams typing stops

SAM
(quietly)
Young man taking my life in my
hands I must inform you that you
are an asshole

Cameron ignores Sam
- 90 -

SAM (CONTD)
Being a devout masochist it follows
that Im Elis best friend I know
quite a lot about him and Nina

CAMERON
You and the entire crew buddy

SAM
(wryly)
He met her three years ago Two
lonely people rattling around New
York A brutal winter Elis
marriage had just broken up

CAMERON
(interrupting in anger)
--All she had to do was tell me

SAMS VOICE
She could have done that in four
seconds They went to bed once and
they were lousy as lovers But they
had a problem They liked each
other They recognized some area of
mutual sensitivity Im boring you

CAMERON
You telling me he banged her once
three years ago

SAMS VOICE
(disgusted)
Im going to see if they can put me
up in the employees toilet

He begins to type again then philosophically

SAMS VOICE (CONTD)
I think he banged her twice to
confirm the awful truthWas she
supposed to be a virgin

CAMERON
Yeah

But he says this so sadly and looks so miserable that Sam knows he
has reached him and it touched

SAM

- 91 -

I had a virgin once Had to go to

Guatemala for it She was blind in
one eye and had a stuffed alligator
that said Welcome to Miami Beach

Cameron sits there feeling dumb and full of regrets Then he gets
up goes to Sams closet and begins rummaging through the clothes
Sam watches him curiously

CAMERON
So hows the new ending coming

SAM
I got fourteen versions Take your
pick
(worried about his
clothes )
What are you doing in there

CAMERON
(overly casual)
Fourteen gory ways to die

SAM
Thirteen In one version he
livesturns the girl in opens a

gay bar in Berlin gains fifty
pounds and changes his name to
Goering

(now deeply concerned)
-Please anything but the
sweaters Youll stretch the hell
out of the sleeves

INT RESTAURANT

The pleasant SEAFOOD RESTAURANT is on the pier over the water
Cameron now wearing Sams sweater after all is searching about the
crowded room trying to find Nina and what might be her family He
is about to leave when he sees a group at a window table a MAN and
WOMAN in their early fifties and a FOURTEEN-YEAR-OLD GIRL
attractive despite the baby fat Something about the composite of
all their features is familiar enough to give them a second look

In doing so he sees a half-eaten BIRTHDAY CAKE on their table in
front of an empty place He goes to the table

92 -

CAMERON
(hesitantly)
I was sort of invited to a birthday
party and I cant seem to find
itand this seems to be a birthday
party

The FATHER a hearty bluff good-natured man looks at Cameron
amiably and with a fathers intuition

FATHER
A birthday party is a birthday
partysit down
(Cameron does)
Who was this birthday party for
animal vegetable or mineral

NANCY the fourteen-year-old giggles

NANCY
-Mineral

MOTHER
Will you stop teasing this young
man

CAMERON
Shes really worth finding maam
Shes a very rare mineral

FATHER
(pleased with Cameron)
How old is this mineral

CAMERON
This morning she was acting about
ninety but she might be lying a
year or two

The father now really comfortable recognizing a fellow humorist

FATHER
No you got the wrong tablethis
ones acting like shes sixbut
the missus tells me birthdays are
very emotional for the ladies

At this moment Cameron can tell from their faces that theyve seen
Nina behind him He turns

POV

- 93 -

Nina has emerged from the ladies room looking miserable and is
walking toward them At the shock of seeing Cameron her hand flies
to her mouth in such embarrassment and joy and confusion at the way
she feels that she starts back to the refuge of the ladies room
Catching herself she turns back to face him her eyes now glowing
with tears of happiness

HOTEL CORRIDOR - CLOSE ON CAMERON - LATER THAT NIGHT

He moves forward and kisses Nina We now realize we are at her
HOTEL ROOM DOOR She on the inside he on the outside kissing
through the doorway which stands slightly ajar With their mouths
barely parting

NINA

NINA

Cameron pales knowing that drunken Henrys desire for revenge can
expose him to the police He grabs the dime from Henrys fingers
and drops it into a PEANUT VENDING MACHINE

HENRY
What the hell you doin

Cameron stuffs the bag of peanuts in Henrys shirt pocket grabs his
suitcase and hustles him out of the bar toward the FRONT DOOR

CAMERON

HENRY

As Henrys last words sink in Cameron stands pale and shaken

HENRY (CONTD)
I better grab that cab

Henry takes the suitcase from Camerons numb hand and pushes through
the door looks back for a parting shot

HENRY (CONTD)
You tell â€˜em everythingdont
mince words

As he goes towards cab some MERRYMAKERS push their way into the
lobby

CLOSE ON CAMERON

Staring ahead Henrys words echo like his own death warrant The
merrymakers jostle past him discussing suntan ointments Cameron
turns and walks across the HOTEL LOBBY and UP the STAIRShis pace

He FREEZES Over his shoulder we see Nina naked lying on the
bed Raymond also naked sits slumped on the edge of the bed
utterly disconsolate The three stare at each other an absurd
tableau Cameron whirls and leaves slamming the door behind him
almost off its hinges

INT HOTEL LOBBY

He comes down the steps like a madman Raging Cameron stomps
across the lobby toward the glass doors that will take him out of
Elis grotesque wonderland He collides with a group of returning
night FISHERMEN still in their slickers carrying their equipment
their catch wrapped in newspapers For a moment he is tangled in
their tackle FISH TUMBLING AND SLIDING along the marble floor

FISHERMAN
Jesusdont step on â€˜em

Cameron stares at them whirls and rushes back across the lobby and
up the stairs

INT NINAS BEDROOM

As Cameron bursts in She stands in her robe in the center of the
room glaring at him

NINA
(screaming)
Get out of here

Hearing WATER running in the bathtub he dashes in but finds the
bathroom empty He moves to the closet and slides the door so
violently that it almost falls off No Raymond

NINA (CONTD)
Get out
(raging)
Ill have you thrown out

She crosses to the phone

CAMERON
Is there anybody in this whole
company you havent screwed

In the HALLWAY a little group of PASSING TOURISTS turn in
wonderment at the tumult through the open doorway Nina leaves the
phone crosses to the door and kicks it shut in the peoples faces
with all her strength

NINA

(furious )
You stupid ignorant bastard How
dare you storm in here like you won
me in a raffle

Cameron realizing for the first time that instead of being ashamed
or frightened she is livid with rage

CAMERON
(coldly)
My girl gave me her key

NINA
I am not your girl I am that mans
girl That man and I have been
lovers for six months Ive known
you two days

CAMERON
(ironically)
Then gee maam I sure hope you
didnt tell him about all that
ballin last night

NINA

Dont you dare be clever with me
He came scratching at the door
tonight like a beaten dog begging
me to say that you were some twenty-
four hour nonsense

(against her will she

starts to cry)
-e-and I had to tell him I thought I
was falling in love with

CAMERON

to blow his top if he finds his

notarized Raymonds lover And
you will sign where it says agreed

He says nothing She on the bed and he on the floor are drained of
all strength and emotion

NINA (CONTD)

You wont turn me into some rotten
whore because your papa once told
that a woman is a certain way and
thats how its gonna be til
Gabriel blows his horn

CAMERON

(wearily)
Okayokay I just want to sit a
couple of seconds without having to
say a word Because if I start
trying to say Im sorry I caught

of Nina as a wild radiant eighteen-year old Austrian girl running
pell-mell along a willow-lined VILLAGE STREET dodging children and
bicycles She collides with an OLD MAN her basket falls its
contents scattering his momentary anger vanishing as he is infected
with her joy of life He helps her refill the basket and she
rewards him with a sausage and a kiss The old man watches her
wistfully as she runs away

ELI
-132 through 40 next Sam should
see this I think I left in a line
of his dialogue
(yelling to
projectionist)
Go ahead

ANGLE ON PORTABLE SCREEN

The room dims and the film starts We see a slate board reading
150A Take 1 The clapper claps and the board is removed
revealing an ATTIC Nina sprawled on her stomach stark naked atop
Raymonds naked body her breasts resting on his chest her legs
apart interlocked with his They look directly at the CAMERA
awaiting their cue with the calm resignation of two people waiting
for the Wilshire bus The MAKEUP GIRL appears in the shot spraying
Ninas back and ass with glycerin sweat from an aerosol can She
disappears as Elis voice on the sound track calls ACTION The
ANGLE TIGHTENS into a less revealing more artistic composition
Their mouths meet Their bodies writhe

CLOSE ON NINAS PARENTS

They stare at the screen in open-mouthed shock and horror Their
once gentle hands grip each other like iron claws trying to squeeze
away the nightmare

ANGLE ON CAMERON

In shock and anger leaning forward on the edge of his chair
looking from Eli to the parents not knowing what to do to stop
this

ANGLE ON NANCY

She sinks down in her seat her surprise becoming malicious pleasure
at the reaction of her parents

ANGLE ON ELI

ELI
(upset)
Sweet Christ I told â€˜em to hold
that

SCRIPT GIRL
(starting to leave her
seat)
Ill stop it

- 103 -

ELI
(restraining her
resigned)
Too late nowonly make it worse

We hear the passionate murmurings from the screen as Eli scrunches
down in his seat

ANGLE ON PORTABLE SCREEN
The lovers convulse with erotic abandon as they approach orgasm
ANGLE ON NINAS PARENTS

Like a Charles Addams rendering of a Brady tintype Their faces
wear the stiff frozen smiles of the hopelessly insane

EXT MOVIE SET - CLOSE ON NINA

Shes now made up to look like a woman in her forties Everything
about her tells us these have been brutal years filled with pain
and loss She is reacting in anguish to something 0S But even
though she manages a few tears it doesnt quite ring true Eli
steps into the shot

ELI
(to the crew OS)
All right save it

ANGLE TO INCLUDE CAMERON

On the sidelines as he coldly watches Eli put his arm around Nina
and stroll her away from the crew so they are out of earshot

ANGLE ON ELI AND NINA - MOVING

ELI
Nina The shame of itthe shame
Youve lost your son your lover
You want to tear his throat out
but you stand meekyour guts
burning with the shame of it

NINA
God I dont know whats wrong with

me

She has looked up at her parents who stand off to one side like
zombies watching

NINA (CONTD)
- 104 -

Maybe its themI feel like Im in
a zoo Let me say bye-bye and get
â€˜em on their way It might help

She starts to move towards her parents but Eli puts a restraining
hand on her

ELI
(upset)
Honeyyou better know thisdont
get all shook up now

Nina looks at him with foreboding

ELI (CONTD)
Something got screwed upthe
dailies

NINA
What

ELI
The attic scene The bare-ass attic
scene Im sorry I dont know
how it was too late to stop it
your parents

CLOSE ON NINA

She has not blinked not turned her heard for fear that her
fathers eyes might meet hers She is like a statue trembling in an
earthquake about to shatter The sick loathesome shame that fills
her brims over and the statueâ€™s blind eyes flow tears

CLOSE ON ELI

Tense barely breathing

ELI
(an urgent whisper)
--Roll film

He eases back out of view The ANGLE SLOWLY TIGHTENS

- 105 -

CLOSE ON NINA

As she falls apart before our eyes and an OS VOICE on a PLAYBACK
TAPE insinuates into our consciousness echoing as though heard
through many loudspeakers

VOICE
I envy you the pride you must feel
today A young hero has fallen
gloriously on the field of battle

Hands reach in and drape a sash around Ninas throat From it
dangles a SWASTIKA For Nina there is still no voice no camera
only the obliterating shame for that image of her naked body burned
into her fathers memory And yet that shame is so similar to the
shame she should be feeling as the woman in Elis film at this
mockery of her sons death

VOICE (CONTD)
A nation has lost a son A mother
has lost a son

The sound has now grown to a proportion reminiscent of those German
newsreels of Hitler victory rallies

VOICE (CONTD)
This sacrifice in blood brings
closer mans noblest dreama
thousand years of peace

The THUNDEROUS SOUND of ten thousand voices shouting Sieg Heil
Sieg Heil has shattered Ninas isolation She is now aware that
her personal despair has been used to accomplish an acting trick
and it only adds to her degradation and sense of shame ironically
making her performance even more poignant The crowd on the
playback roars with fanatic zeal

EXT HALL - CLOSE ON CAMERON - LATER

Striding rapidly down the hall looking like a man who hopes to find
a fight to dissipate his residual anger He rounds a corner
almost colliding with Eli who comes rapidly from an intersecting
corridor Eli puts his arm around Camerons shoulder hurrying him
along even faster

ELI
Giddyap soldier Last one theres
on Medicare

Cameron shrugs his arm off in annoyance as they round the corner and
hurrv down some STAIRS
- 106 -

CAMERON
Where are we rushing to I Was
asleep

ELI

Trouble staying awake huh

They reach the bottom of the steps and move swiftly down another
corridor as Eli fishes through his pockets and comes up with a
PIECE OF CHEWING GUM

ELI (CONTD)

Stick of gum Makes you hum
(ignored he chews it
himself)

Do you read

CAMERON
Short words

Eli finds a BOOKLET he has been looking for and hands it to Cameron

ELI
Schickel and Bergenstadt couple
of Dutch comedy writers See its
got pictures But dont skim
Chucks gonna quiz you If you
pass you get a free trip to
Amsterdam and you can stick your
finger in a dike

CAMERON
(looking at the book as
he walks)
What the hell is this

ELI
A pamphlet on how to get out of a
sunken car You know they got this
problem in Hollandthose canals
So these guys are experts

CAMERON
Did Burt read this

ELI
Off hand Id say no wouldnt you

CAMERON
(hands it back to him)

- 107 -

No chance

ELI
There you go rejecting me again

Eli pushes open the double doors and they find themselves standing
in the MAKESHIFT SCREENING ROOM

ELI (CONTD)
Youve gotta think positive Burt

INT SCREENING ROOM

Jake is there with SEVERAL OTHER MEN But before Cameron can even
register who they are Eli is saying

ELI
Im sorry gentlemen but Ive got
exactly two minutes of borrowed
time Im in the middle of a scene
(to projectionist)
Get it started

Immediately the lights snap off and the film is projected on the

screen In the dark the men in the room fumble their way to seats
On the projection screen we see a helicopter SHOT OF THE DUESENBERG
APPROACHING THE BRIDGE Cameron is suddenly alert like a jungle

beast whos just heard the trap slam shut behind him His eyes dart
around at the official-looking faces staring at the 0S film One
face looks disturbingly familiar but in the dark he cant place it

JAKE

(addressing a man next to

him)
This fellow here is the stunt man
driving that car

(to Cameron)
Thompson is from the FBI They
wanted you here in case they have
any questions

On the projection screen we see the DUESENBERG GO OFF THE EDGE OF
THE BRIDGE disappear in the water

THOMPSON
I dont see anybody else on the
roaddid you Burt

CAMERON
No

- 108 -

The MAN Cameron couldnt recognize speaks out

OTHER MAN
My buddy and I saw that son-of-a-
bitch break out of the woods and
head that way down the road

The lights go on and Cameron looks at the speaker recognizing him
as one of the TELEPHONE LINEMEN Apparently the lineman doesnt
recognize Cameron in his new identity

LINEMAN
---I had a clear view I was on top
of the pole

THOMPSON
Do you mind if we see that again

ELI

Help yourself the room is yours
But Ive got thirty people on the
set being paid for doing nothing

(moving toward the door

and calling)
Come on Burt youve got some
reading to do

Cameron follows Eli as the lights go out and the film begins again
JAKE
Hey Burt glad youre still alive
considering who youre working for

INT HALL

Cameron moves swiftly down the corridor behind Eli who starts up
the stairs still blithely chewing his gum

ELI
Something wrong Why are you
lagging

CAMERON

Im trying to figure it out That
film Where was I

ELI
How tall is King Kong

CAMERON
Three-foot-six
166A

- 109 -

ELI
Good boy I got all kinds of
versions Wanna go back and see
some

Cameron understands the implied threat and Eli knowing he has made
his point continues good-humoredly

ELI (CONTD)
Ive even got a version where you
fly the helicopter and Im driving
the Duesenberg Its a dilly

They have now charged out of the building and are racing across the
grounds toward the set

CAMERON
What about the version where I go
over the bridge and die in the
water

ELI
(chewing gum)
Hey kid what is this with you
That red dye must be eating through
your scalp and affecting your brain
Why would I want to hurt you

CAMERON
Because you dont like my tatoo

ELI
I think its beautiful Its
heroic I think its a major work

that may rank with the Edsel grill
Now goddamnit I gotta go back and
do my picture Will you take this
thing and read

He holds the booklet out to him and it is very hard for Cameron to
reach out and take it Out of the corner of his eye he sees the
FBI MEN leaving the building heading off in another direction He
stares at the booklet

CAMERON
(softly)
I knew a guywho stepped on a
bouncing Betty booby trap Stepping
on it wasnt his problemthey
explode when vou stepv off So all

- 110 -

he could do was just stand there
It was getting light If we didnt
get out wed of been shot up So
we left

Eli has been watching him thoughtfully

CAMERON (CONTD)
-He had this screwy West Texas
accent I remember Hey
fellashey fellas

Eli blows a BUBBLE with his gum that POPS on cue as though it were
the explosion of the bouncing Betty Grinning he sticks the
booklet in Camerons shirt pocket turns and walks off

ANGLE ON ELI - MOVING SHOT
Sam catches up and walks beside him toward the set

SAM
Why dont you let the kid go before
he gets hurt

ELI
Chuck keeps an eye on him

SAM
Hes dangerous to have around Stop
playing games Eli Tell Jake
youve replaced him What are you
so hooked on

ELI
He helps me understand the kid in
our story

SAM
Bullshit

- 111 -

ELI
Hes like one of those land mines
left over from a war that go off
from time to time You read about
it in the paper two or three years
latersome kid in a bell tower
shoots a dozen students for no
reason at allhis mother says he
was always such a good boyI guess
Id like to know what he really did

As they reach the set Gabe the cameraman charges up

GABE

Did you bring the tampax Raymonds
still acting like hes got the

curse

ELI
(with black humor)

You suppose Raymond knows how to

drive a Duesenberg
INT NINAS BEDROOM

Scattered about the room are suitcases

a wardrobe trunk the almost

completed packing for tomorrows departure Nina lies in bed
staring into nothing Cameron beside her Each is talking aloud to
himself adrift in his private world unaware they have lost contact

with the other The room is semi-dark

except for the nightstand

light on Camerons side by which he studies the BOOKLET Eli gave

him

NINA

It was so unnecessaryFor
Christs sake Im no shrinking
violetIve had my ass pinched
black and blue by account execs for
not showing enough enthusiasm for
Vitalis But this from Eliit was

so pointlesssadistic
CAMERON
(reading)

---Open All windows slowly to keep
pressure from caving in the roof
should an unexpected skid achieve

aquatic consequences

kind of witty

NINA

Thats
- 112 -

(still in her own world)
--Couldve handled it later on It
doesnt look so raunchy after its
cutMaybe Id of got them
stonedsomethingbut for Eli to
trap them like that

CAMERON
(eyes on the book)
BeautifulTheres a second school
of thought that says the first
school is all wet It says Keep
the windows rolled up tight and wait
for the air bubble

NINA
Say it was an accidentbenefit of
the doubt But then to use me that
waylike a gadgetWhy would Eli
do that Hes not a cruel man

CAMERON
(not looking up)
Hes not a cruel man Hes a crazy
man A maniac

NINA
What
CAMERON
(reading)

The water pressure at two hundred
feet can crush a man into the size

of an egg He wants to get that on
filmso hes gonna kill me
NINA

(jumping out of bed)
What in Gods name are you babbling
about

CAMERON
Its a rotten shame about your folks
and your naked ass but dying always
scared me a little okay

NINA
- 113 -

Â»e-and you are beginning to scare
me Youre talking like a wild
man

CAMERON
Did you know that Eli almost
strangled a man because he stopped
the camera when Burt got killed

NINA
What is going on in that head of
yours You take the word of

somemalcontenttechnician

CAMERON
-I saw the bruises

NINA
-And I saw Eli that night when he
had to tell Burts brother on the

phoneI saw the tears

CAMERON
She saw the tears Did you ask him
what he was crying about Cause

you can bet your sweet tits it
wasnt over Burt He was crying
over losing his fucking shot

To keep from exploding Nina opens her luggage and furiously starts
repacking

NINA
Didnt they give IQ tests in the
army What did you getminus
twelve Havent you figured out yet
why hes working himself to death
What his film is all about Hes
trying to tell people not to kill
each other

CAMERON
And you know what You want the
shock of your life I understand

what the son-of-a-bitch is saying
and he may be rightwhich makes me
what Minus twelve the dumb
schmuck with a gun That doesnt
change the fact that hes crazy If
he had his way there wouldnt be a
soldier left alive bv mornina But
- 114 -

all hes got on hand is me I dont
know if he is doing it consciously
but its a hell of an idea If he
can really get it on film a genuine
dumb fuck grunt cashing in before
your very eyes I mean the real
McCoythats gotta help his
pictureThen hes killed two birds

with one stone Its got a nice
logic Trouble is both birds are
me

Against her instincts Nina is emotionally affected by what Cameron
says

NINA
Stop itsweetheartId die if
anything happened to you

The TELEPHONE RINGS Her head whips to look at it It continues
ringing but she doesnt move

NINA
Its my fatherI wont talk to
himYoure all driving me
crazyI wont talk to him

Cameron calmly picks up the phone

CAMERON
Hihello

NINA
(whispering)
Tell them Im not here Tell them
anything Tell them Im working

CAMERON
(glancing at Nina)
Okay Chuck I11l meet you in an
hour
(he hangs up)
For me Amazing how they keep
secrets around here

He walks over to the still-stricken Nina and tenderly embraces her
She leans against him the trembling subsiding
CAMERON
What if I told you I wasnt going to
do the stunt
- 115 -

NINA
Id say fine

CAMERON
And what if I told you I was gonna
get out of here tonightand that I
want you to come with me

NINA
(upset and confused)
But theres just one more day of
shooting

CAMERON
What if I cant wait

NINA
II have two more scenes

CAMERON
Thats a shame

NINA
--I could meet you

When he doesnt answer Nina resorts to her last defense irrational
anger

NINA (CONTD)
-Look dont do the stunt If you
believe Elis a killer call the
policeWhy are you doing this to
me Thats all I need right now
with all Ive been throughFor
you to give me now-or-never
ultimatums and tell me my director
is insane

By now she is stalking about the room throwing things from one
suitcase to another as Cameron silently watches her
- 116 -

INT GARAGE - LATE NIGHT - LOW ANGLE ON THE BLACK DUESENBERG

Which stands alone like Moby Dick awaiting its victim Chuck and
Cameron appear from behind the car stalking it like it were the
Sunday Special on a used car lot Chuck the hearty salesman
Cameron the reluctant customer

CHUCK
Look at this motherIll bet these
guys could build an Arabian out of a

jackass

CAMERON
Why not You built a stunt man out
of one

CHUCK

Stunt man Three days and youve
already grown those big brass balls
Jump up and down and let me hear â€˜em
clang and then do me a favor and
leave em home for this gag

(yanks open the door)
Theres just enough room in that
Duesenberg for a normal guywho
thinks

(Cameron slides in)
Show me how long you can hold your
breath

Cameron inhales deeply and Chuck clicks his stopwatch
- 117 -

CHUCK

Now look around Whaddya seeNo
roll bar in the roof Thats
because the roof caving in really
looks gassy on film You got your
protection in the back of the
seatsteel sheeting If the roof

head down quick You listening to
meNod Your head

(slapping Cameron on

back)
You got good lungs

(buckles Camerons

seatbelt)
You got no shoulder harness because
it would show on camera So when
you hit the water you brace
yourself against the steering wheel
Its reinforced You couldnt break
it loose with dynamiteyou gettinâ€™
light-headed yet

Cameron shakes his head No

CHUCK

Keep your hands off the doors
Youre leaving through the window
You lower them slowly as you sink to
equalize the pressure What are you

there holding your hand

(Cameron lowering

windows )
Slower When you hit bottom the
windows are open and youre gonna
make like a minnow But first a
little fresh air wouldnt hurt You
reach down under the seat and what
do you know a respiratorMake
like youre reaching for it
Therell be one there tomorrow

Cameron reaches for the non-existent respirator

CHUCK (CONTD)
No keep your face forward the
camera is behind you and its still
running
- 118 -

By this time Camerons breath is giving out and hes struggling to
hold it

CHUCK (CONTD)
You feel like your lungs are gonna
burst Good Thats the way youre
supposed to act like you feel The
moment that water gets above your
nose you gotta look like youre
drowning Remember Burt wasnt so
good at that

That knocks the wind out of Cameron

CAMERON
He sure as hell convinced me

Chuck clicks his stopwatch and scowls

CHUCK

(defensively)
Things happen crossin the street
If somethin goes cockeyedscrew

the scene Get that mask on
Theres enough oxygen to get you to
China

(rolls up the window)
Well try it again

CAMERON
(still panting)
Let me catch my breath

CHUCK
What youll catch is a lungful of
water Youre at the bottom of the
riverYou breathe when I goddamn
tell you to breathe

CAMERON
(the pupil tricking the
teacher )
Hey Chuck you blindCant you
see Ive got my respirator on

CHUCK
You just goddamn remember you dont
have gills

169A Chuck has stalked over to the WORKBENCH and angrily picks up the
PHONE which has been rinaina incessantlv over the last few lines

- 119 -

CHUCK
(shouting)
What
(listens then yells to
Cameron)
Elis at the police station

CAMERON
Thats the best news Ive heard
Lets hope its a felony

CHUCK
He needs Gabe Theyre lookin for
a driver so Im gonna take him
Come on with me

CAMERON

CHUCK

(climbing into the

company car)
You and me are gonna talk about
windows and oxygen and seat belts
and things like that And if youre
a good boy and listen and dont be a
smart ass maybe Ill let you sit in
the back seat with Nina Franklin

CAMERON
Nina

Chuck already in the car is grinning Now hes even for the
respirator bit

CHUCK
You might even get to hold hands

EXT POLICE STATION - MOVING SHOT ON CAMERON

The POLICE STATION comes into view seen through the window of the
company car which slows as it moves toward the curb Eli sitting
on the front stoop leans wearily against the stone lion As he
sees the car approach he moves toward it quickly opening the door
almost before it stops

- 120 -

ELI
(beckoning)
Gabe Nina

Eli pulls Gabe and Nina toward the police station yelling back to
Cameron and Chuck

ELI (CONTD)
You two better wait here

Cameron watches them confused as they start up the steps toward
the station house

ANOTHER ANGLE - ELI NINA GABE - MOVING SHOT

NINA
I hate this damn it Couldnt you
have done it without me

ELI
Lets say you owe it to him Until
two or three days ago I hada
pretty good actor on my hands Next

little humane make sure the guys
got one to spare

NINA
(furious )
What did you want me to do Take

ELI
Just get your greedy little ass
inside and make sure you give the
performance of your life

INT POLICE STATION

As the three enter The station is old with a high sergeants desk
and wooden benches against the walls Raymond beyond tears
destroyed sits among the other refuse of the night derelicts
stoned kids etc On one bench is a SAILOR with that adenoidal
look that betrays the weakness he tries to hide with his butch
arrogance Jake in the doorway of his office savors the fact that
he has finally nailed Eli Cross Eli captures the setup ina
glancethen instant theater He strides across the police
station to Raymond takes his head in his hands and kisses him smack
on the mouth

ELI
(vehemently)
Whos better boobyhim or me

Gabe has come up behind a PATROLMAN grabs him by the hips and
starts humping like a dog in heat The policeman shrieks in dismay
and tries to escape but Gabe trots along as if they were locked

ELI
(shouting)
Jake Throw some water on him
quick Only way to get â€˜em apart

Gabe is now distracted by the sight of the sailor who is agape with
growing disbelief Gabe ogles him

GABE
Yummylook at the seafood Youre
a humpy little number
(then to Raymond
stamping his foot)
You nasty boy You couldve died of
mercury poisoning

The sailor leaps to his feet in horror screaming

SAILOR
Jesus Christ theyre all faggots

ANGLE ON SERGEANTS DESK

Eli has stormed to the counter and slams his fist down on it
furiously confronting Jake

- 122 -

ELI

(shouting)
Im registering a complaint Thirty-
two members of my company got VD
from your local virgins The
Chamber of Commerce didnt say
anything about that in their
brochure

JAKE

You can stop clowning Eli Ive got
a sworn complaint from this
sailor

(jabbing his finer in

Raymonds 0OS direction)
--Your man over there touched his
genitals

ANGLE ON RAYMOND AND NINA

She is snuggled against him tenderly her open mouth kissing his
neck and cheek Raymond although aware of his desperate situation
is too sick with self-loathing to respond

ANGLE ON ELI AND JAKE

ELI
Oh Jake Come on You wouldnt
know your anal invert from a hole in
the ground Raymond makes bad
jokes but theyre not illegal
Christ youve seen us all on the
setclowning around

EXT POLICE STATION

Cameron stands peering in through the big front window feeling
once again betrayed Its like watching TV with the sound shut off
From here Nina and Raymond are very convincing Chuck leans
against a lamppost smoking a cigarette as the charade goes on
- 123 -

177 INT POLICE STATION
Eli now going full blast

ELI
My companys been pouring sixty
thousand dollars a week into this
place for which your mayor and
governor seem very grateful We
paid enough in taxes and fees alone
to buy you parking meters from here
to the boardwalk

SAILOR
(feeling its all going
wrong)
Everything I said in that statement
is the flat-ass truth

Eli pays no attention knowing that hes got Jake He gestures
toward Nina embracing Raymond

ELI
Jake I got a very horny leading
lady whos got an early call and
would like to spend some time with
her boyfriend before she makes
night-night Now can I please
get â€˜em outta here before they
really do something illegaland in
front of witnesses

178 INT HOTEL CORRIDOR - ON ELEVATOR DOORS - NIGHT

Its three oclock in the morning The corridors are empty as the
elevator door swings open and Nina and Eli step out and move down
the hallway functioning on their last ounce of nervous energy

ELI
Sorry I had to put you through that
I know it was humiliating

NINA
--It was awfulI hated it But
you did save that mans life
- 124 -

ELI
Yeah that was really nice of me
Im a nice person I just wish I
had the strength to go to his room
and break his spine On the last
day of filming the queen decides to
come out of the closet Wouldnt
that have made a lovely headline
You understand of course that the
film wouldve been destroyed Doing
that to me

NINA
Eli whats wrong

ELI
Nothing serious Just a little
self-indulgence Feel-sorry-for-

Eli-time
Eli on the edge of nervous exhaustion is actually close to tears

ELI (CONTD)
Im sorry but you knowits too
goddamn much Whys everybody on my
back Whens somebody gonna say
There there Eli Im really
surrounded by friends allies and
youWhat else can I do for your
film Eli

NINA
(wounded )
Thats not fair

They have reached a turn in the corridor where each would go his
separate way They stop

ELI
Whats not fairgetting my
feelings hurt When did I lose
you to that soldier boy Nina That
nice wholesome swell-looking
kidwanted by every cop the FBI
and God knows who else for God
knows what crime

Nina is paralyzed with shock
- 125 -

ELI (CONTD)
Come on Nina those blue eyes have
bedazzled our little girl For
Christs sake he reeks of blood

NINA
You sound as crazy as
(she stops)

ELI

(wryly)
As who

NINA
He thinks youre trying to
(she cant say â€˜kill)
-eharm him

ELI
Any number of people are trying to
harm him

He walks off down the corridor
179 INT HOTEL BASEMENT - LATER THAT NIGHT

Partly crated props and costumes luggage belonging to the departing
film crew is piled against the wall and on shelves In the
cavernous half-lit room Cameron once again the coiled stealthy
animal moves through the shadows among the racks of suitcases
pulling them aside searching Discovering one he sets it on the
floor Its locked With a metal bar he breaks the lock and
eagerly rifles the contents Then sensing a presence he turns
There stands Nina at the base of the steps watching him With only
a glance to her he goes on with his search

CAMERON
Howd you know I was down here

NINA
The desk clerk

He finds a WALLET opens it getting to his feet triumphantly

CAMERON
How about that for luck Burts
from Idahono picture on the
drivers license

Cameron stuffs the wallet in his pocket moving along the row of
suitcases He vulls out a duffel baa unzinos it shakina the
- 126 -

contents on the floor Now with the open bag on his arm he goes
along the row of costumes and props like a man in the supermarket
stuffing in things he will need a pair of hiking boots a couple
of work shirts a heavy jacket Passing a shelf of bayonets he
picks one out and throws it in the bag

NINA
(quietly)
Who are you

CAMERON
(ignoring the
seriousness)
Name it

Above the bayonets are army helmets He tries one on

CAMERON (CONTD)
Hey hows this A World War One
uhwhat did they call â€˜em
dogfaces somethin doughboys

(flings a nurses uniform
at her)

Wanna be the nurse
179A From some hospital props he grabs a wheelchair and shoves it toward
her

CAMERON (CONTD)
--You tell me this wouldnt work
A pretty nurse pushing a vet ina
wheelchair When we hit that
roadblock wed have â€˜em crying like
babies

NINA
(quietly)
Who the hell are you

CAMERON
Somebody trying to stay
aliveanybody--that can get past
the dogs and the quicksand
(making a shrewd guess)
Who did Eli say I was

NINA
Im asking you God damn

She has fiercely grabbed his naked shoulder
- 127 -

CAMERON
Easy with that tatooit mighta
lost me Eli but it won me Lt Emily
Schmidt the greatest boobs in
Southeast Asiaand a very
patriotic chick So I got this
tattoo for 28 bucks And when she
saw this shoulder let me tell ya
holy Jesus Following which I got
the clap from the Lt And hepatitis
from the tattoo needle You know
what bothers me I think Emily is
gonna be very offended by Elis
picture

Nina cannot endure another moment of this charade

NINA
Why do they want you What did you
do

CAMERON

Elid tell youI was a soldier I
did the same as everybody just one

of the boys emptied my M-16 at
any sound dont know whether I
killed gooks or cherriesthe new

kids from the States we call â€˜em
cherries which they were for maybe
fifteen minutes The dry season is
when it really breaks loose You
get very tired Its like falling
asleep at the wheel You close your
eyes and it still goes on Youre
killin them theyre killin you
Couldnt tell ya now what was real
except Im here

We sense in him the fatigue he is describing then pushing aside
that memory

CAMERON (CONTD)

Hey once when things were rough and
the grass ran out I shot the hell
out of a water buffalo

(he considers then passes

judgment on himself)
Actually I wasnt a bad
soldierbetter than most Got
lotsa pretty ribbons Funnysort
of like when I did that first stunt
and everybody started clapping
nothing like a slap on the back to
ruin a man blow his sense of
proportion So I got homeand
uhI guess I expected something
Nothing fancy but something you
knowa free car wash double blue
chip stamps extra time on the
parking meter I dont know
Instead people uh didnt seem
too pleased

(trying to hide a lot of

pain)
In fact they acted like I was gonna
start killing babies

She crosses to him deeply moved

CAMERON (CONTD)
Shit I was supposed to get
married run an ice cream parlor
(picks up his suitcases)
I gotta go

179B Although theyre standing only a couple of feet apart he lifts his
hand tentatively as if to wave goodbye

NINA
-What about the roadblocks

CAMERON
Ill go through the woods

NINA
Dont you suppose therell be cops
in the woods
- 129 -

CAMERON
I suppose there are cops in the
woodwork But what the hellits
a nice night
(he starts to go)

Lovers facing farewells have a gift for suspending time and Nina
speaks out unable to let him leave

NINA
Ive always liked the woods at
night Theyre very romantic You

can hunt for truffles It might be
such fun wed just keep going

Cameron cant afford to fall for her softness

CAMERON
You said we What about your two
scenes

NINA

Thats trueOne of them is three
pages of me making a tunafish salad
for an American flyer in 1917 And
Ive got to weigh that against
losing the man I love Its a big
decision

CAMERON
Nina youre making me crazy

NINA

Im sorry Ima little crazy
myself I cant let you go and I
dont even know who you are

(suddenly the dam bursts

and all self-control is

gone)
Why are they chasing you What
have you done What happens to me
in the woods Will I need a bayonet
too

179Â¢ He stands there staring at her his face suddenly savage After

everything the lady is afraid of him He picks up the duffel bag
and moves for the door then turns on her punishing her with his
words
- 130 -

CAMERON
The charge was attempted murder I
bashed this cops head in It took
the jury about two fucking minutes
It could of been worse It could of
been life But the judgehe
looked real nice at me and said you
were a damn good soldier sonSo
he only gave me twenty years No

way EnoughYou know how long I
was in that prison -- nineteen
months -- and then I was gone I
was gone

She stares in shock and horror His anger is like ice

CAMERON (CONTD)
Caught me breaking into a

storeoh not to rob itI went
there to kill the bastard who owned
it

NINA
Why

CAMERON
-Because

179D Suddenly the ice turns to steam His self-control shatters like
glass There in the basement of a 100-year old hotel before an
audience of one Cameron ERUPTS spewing out the memory of his
mortification and crucifixionnot without the silent resignation
of Jesus but with the howling rage of a mad dogPluto with the
rabies

CAMERON (CONTD)
-Becauseit seemed like a good
idea to twist his fucking head off
Said I could be his partner when I
got backlyin son of a bitch was
real sorry things were slack
Slack my asshe just didnt want
me hangin around because he was
bangin my old lady So I go down
and start bangin on his door

(he starts pounding on
the mirror)
- 131 -

CAMERON (CONTD)
-Hes closed Its two oclock in
the morning I want to smash his
face in and hes closed OPEN UP
YOU BASTARD

179E Camerons fist SMASHES his own face in the dressing table mirror
His reflection crazes and falls to pieces

NINA
(screaming)
Your hand

Cameron holds up his fist to her shaking it in glee

CAMERON
Bang That bright shiny front
window went bye-bye
(reveling in his own

insanity)
-Maybe hes screwin her behind
the counterI climb in there

screamin WHERE ARE YA Come out
here and be a man Where are ya
Behind that counter you son-of-a-
bitch

Cameron kicks over the makeup table as though it were the
countertubes and glasses shatter all over the floor

CAMERON (CONTD)
Ya know whats behind that
counter
(the ultimate horror)
41-DIFFERENT-KINDS-OF-ICE

CREAM and all that fuckin
SYRUP
179F There is a rainbow row of makeup jars and hair tints He starts

HURLING them against the wall where they smash punctuating his
speech with bursts of gooey color

CAMERON (CONTD)
-And these little Mickey Mouse
faces on the wallswith candy
eyeballs

He pauses catching his breath as another image emerges from the
swirl of memory

CAMERON (CONTD)
- 132 -

(tense and frightened)
ThenI see this thing glowing
in the darkI hit that floor so
fast Christ I nearly swallowed my
heart That second I was sureit
was Charliea cigarette butt some
guy on a VC Patrol

(his panic subsides)

Know what it was It was the
GODDAMN PILOT LIGHT ON THE HOT FUDGE
MACHINE That did it That DID
IT HOT FUDGE Me buried in shit
being the damn good soldier the
judge said I was yes sir people
sitting there on their fat asses
feedin their fat faces Can I
have an extra cherry Can I have an
extra cherry

Cameron rips Denises electric hair dryer from the wall and hurls it
across the basement

CAMERON (CONTD)
I smashed that fucking fudge pot
across the room smack into that
shelf full of animalsand it
starts raining pussycats and monkeys
and kangaroo cookies like Noahs
Ark

The hair dryer smashes against a shelf toppling ammunition boxes
and bottles onto the carcass of a disassembled World War I airplane
The propeller topples and falls through a German recruiting poster
and just out at the Kaisers crotch

CAMERON (CONTD)
How long should a girl wait she
says FOR GODDAMN EVER BITCH
THATS HOW LONG

Camerons hands have come to rest on a metal laundry bin He grips
it and lifts it over his head

CAMERON (CONTD)
I picked up this fifty-pound ice
cream vatFLAVOR-OF-THE-MONTH

ROYAL-BAVARIAN-CHOCOLATE-MISTand
I started running with that son-of-
a-bitch

179G
- 133 -

Cameron starts running across the room and just as hes about to
hurl it he COLLIDES with a jutting shelf which knocks him flat on
his back The shelf falls and thirty or forty one-gallon PAINT CANS
cascade on top of him It looks disastrous Nina runs to him
terrified but before the last can has even come to rest Cameron
emerges from the pile of cans throwing them aside still thrashing
and screaming as he struggles to his feet

At the sight of him Nina starts laughing But Cameron who has
somehow managed to keep his grip on the laundry basket raises it
over his head as if nothing has happened hurls the clothes bin
screaming

CAMERON (CONTD)
SCOOP THAT UP YOUR ROYAL BAVARIAN
STRAWBERRY SNATCH

With the effort Camerons feet fly out from under him as if he had
stepped in oil In fact he has stepped in paint and lands flat on
his ass in the green goo Nina bracks out an uncontrollable
guffaw

CAMERON
(bellowing)
Its not funny

Shamed Nina runs to him

NINA
Oh baby

But as she reaches him her feet too are caught in the paint and
she slides forward like an ice skater spraddling him landing on
her ass His rage vanishes as he points at her breaking into a
fiendish uncontrollable cackle These pratfalls are a catharsis
that has released the pressure and the madness They attempt to
gain their feet skidding and sliding in the paint He succeeds
but Nina fails

NINA
(through laughter)
Let me go to the bathroom Im
gonna have an accident
- 134 -

CAMERON
Youll miss the main part Killer
Camerons ghastly crime I was

freaked out of my head And
suddenly theres this big flashlight
shining in my face I just grabbed
that goddamn ice cream bucket and
slopped itright over the guys
head

Although Camerons got nothing in his hands he pantomimes swinging
that fifty-pound ice cream bucket around in the air losing his
balance and landing on his back in the paint beside Nina Her
hysteria is renewed but Cameron stops laughing

CAMERON (CONTD)

(quietly)
Its not funny It wasnt him It
was a cop I got out of there like
a shot I didnt know he was
knocked out How the hell did I
know he was gonna lay there all
night with his head in the ice
cream

NINA
(suddenly serious)
Oh my God He died

CAMERON
No hes in the hospital

NINA
Oh no
CAMERON
Oh yes That ice creams goddamn
cold
(struggling for a proper
description)
His noseit froze and his ear

froze seeand
Despite the horror of it Nina starts giggling She cant help it

CAMERON (CONTD)
(indignantly)
No its terribleHe lost the tip
of his nose and his ear lobe
179H

- 135 -

Then Cameron realizing the absurdity starts giggling too Out of
control Nina scrambles to her feet and dashes for the ladies room
Cameron follows her to the door still talking as it closes behind
her

CAMERON (CONTD)
Ill tell ya its a bad year to
mess with cops You get the FBI
screaming down on your ass

NINA
(through the door)
Oh God Too lateThanks a lot

Abruptly Camerons energy is gone The hilarity is over He leans
his forehead against the door in exhaustion and despair

CAMERON
(softly)
If we woke up Eli and told him
about the ice creamwould he
forgive me and call off the
stunt

INT GARAGE - PRE-DAWN

The DUESENBERG STANDS silhouetted in the darkness light glinting
dimly off it like the gleam from fine wood of a splendid coffin
waiting in the slumber room before services begin Behind it a
side door of the garage opens But it is not visitors coming to pay
their last respects it is Cameron and Nina He is wearing Burts
clothes

Nina moves quickly to a WHITE CONVERTIBLE as Cameron crosses to the
big overhead garage doors and hits the electric SWITCH NOTHING
HAPPENS He flips another switch and harsh overhead lights
illuminate the reality of the garage Nina has started the
convertible as Cameron tries to lift the garage door handles

CAMERON
How the hell dya open this thing

VOICE (0S)
Sorry folks its locked

Nina gasps Cameron whirls towards the voice A COP with a big
flashlight stands in the open doorway peering in at them
- 136 -

CAMERON
We know its locked Would you open

COP

COP

- 138 -

CAMERON

I cant believe itHe knows The
son-of-a-bitch knows whatever Im
thinking Im beginning to feel
like something that Sam wrote Im
not real Im some jerk American
flyer from World War I who has to go
over a bridge and die because the
goddamn script says so Its
crazyIm trapped in his goddamn
story If somebody lost that page
Id be fine If he crossed it out
and wrote something else like -- At
the last moment he veers the big
car from the railing--then goes
speeding on to live happy ever
after

(he looks at the

Duesenberg appraisingly

then grins as a plan

starts to form)
--How about that Empty road me
out there all alone the crew â€˜way
back breathless as I approach the
bridge And thenHey what
happened A fucking rewrites
what happened Ill have a fifteen-
minute jump on them before they
figure out theyre shooting a new
version

Nina has come to life her eyes aglow like a shrewd little girl
whos already decided how the fairy tale will end

NINA
-And what about the love story
What happens to the Austrian girl
People will leave the movie feeling
terribleI know She goes with
him

CAMERON
How

Nina has walked around to the back of the Duesenberg and opens the
TRUNK

NINA
In here

CAMERON
- 139 -

(cautiously)
Not bad But I think they arrange
to meet laterlike in a Greyhound

Bus station a couple of towns away

NINA
Nolook
(she climbs in)
See how big it is Comfortable
tooHonestly honey its a better
ending

CAMERON
(firmly)
Nina get out of the trunk

The pretending has ended

NINA
And what happens in the morning Do
I show up on the set in my little
pink pinafore and say Hi Eli
Wheres my hug and kiss How do
I do that now

CAMERON
(sternly)
--Get out of the trunk

NINA
-Or should I trot up to my room to
catch a couple of winks and cuddle
up with a dozen sleeping pills

CAMERON
(angry)
Its my nightmareStay out This
isnt the time to solve your
neurotic problems Im trying to
stay alive

NINA
(shouting back)
So am I And I never claimed not to
have neurotic problems

CAMERON
(interrupting)

Oh for Christs sake

NINA

- 140 -

-They come with the body Its
all one A package deal

The shouting endsand in despairing silence VOICES of approaching
WORKMEN are heard grumbling that the coffees late

CAMERON
(urgent whisper)
Nina please theres somebody
coming Get out of the trunk

As we glimpse the WORKMEN in the doorway she reaches up grabs the
inside of the trunk lid and pulls it down disappearing from sight
as the trunk slams shut

EXT THE OLD ABANDONED ROAD - EARLY MORNING

In the stillness as the morning sun crests the trees their shadows
move like a parting curtain leaving sunlight to warm the old stones
of the abandoned road The ancient bridge spans the black river
idling toward the sea It is a perfect day tranquil except for the
faint distant rumbling intruding into our consciousness As it
grows louder and LOUDER a flock of birds is frightened from the
trees a rusty beer can by the roadside begins to tremble and roll
from the vibration

Rounding the bend of the road into view are a half-dozen kids on
bicycles peddling furiously laughing and yelling and looking back
at what now appears behind them the first vehicle of an incredible
carnival parade -- or is it a funeral procession Long short
tall fat vehicles the stretch-out car the cab towing portable
toilets the tractor pulling a generator rig the Cortez Camper
dressing rooms the stake-bed loaded with reflectors rattling like
radar screens panel trucks with studio emblems a vintage German
army truck filled with soldiers patrol cars and motorcycles the
huge bright yellow construction crane on its Caterpillar treads
its pneumatic snout jutting forward thirty yards like a morning
hard-on sniffing around for some tunnel to hump -- a few technicians
straddle it having their morning Danish and coffee In the midst of
these on a low-slung flatbed trailer rides the Duesenberg -- the
coffin on its caisson

The caravan grinds hisses wheezes to a halt and the AD astride
the hood of the first vehicle dismounts and raises his electric
bullhorn to begin what will be an incessant squawking of
instructions reprimands coaxings and complaints
- 141 -

AD
All right peoplethe rest period
is over Another fifteen minutes
and we start losing sun Come on
lets get the equipment off those
trucks

The Second ADs run around like sheepdogs herding the laborers
snapping at their flanks barking their instructions over electric
horns

AD (CONTD)
ChuckChuck Barton where do you
want the Duesenberg

Grips and laborers are carrying the big reflectors through the brush
into the hills

AD (CONTD)
Mr Cross please The camera
crews ready for a setup

ANGLE ON ELI AND THE CAMERA CREW
They are already huddled squatting on their haunches under a tree
ELI

The R-35 in the chopper on the maxi-
mount the underwater Imo in the

ANGLE ON THE DUESENBERG
Being rolled up to a mark in the center of the road Crewmen swarm

in and under it tuning polishing testing installing camera
sound electrical equipment as Chuck hovers over them

- 142 -

AD
All drivers pleaseI want every
equipment vehicle back behind the
bend
As motors rev the two sheepdogs squawk Out of sight Behind
the bend then are lost in the rising dust of their herd

ANOTHER ANGLE

Cables are being strung out of sight along the side of the road
snapped into junction boxes that spread their electrified tentacles
strangling the landscape

AD

(pointing at the mike boom)
Whats that supposed to be Ralph
--An elm or an oak Get that mike
off the boom and into the bushes
Come on people lets think Were
losing the sun

ANOTHER ANGLE FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD

Gabe Chuck the AD and a Technician move down the road toward us
shoulder to shoulder halting on the bridge Chuck and Gabe move to
the stone railing Chuck taps on it producing a hollow sound
Gabe examining a corner of this false section

GABE
(to AD)
Have em touch up that corner of the
section It looks phony as hell

The AD has been drawing a chalk line across the road

AD
(to Technician)
Climb down there in the bushes and
stay out of sight

TECHNICIAN
What about earphones

AD
Just watch your mark

- 143 -

WIDE ANGLE ON THE DUESENBERG

Behind it the last of the equipment trucks is being jack-knifed out
of sight A row of reflectors stand like sentinels on the hill
bathing the Duesenberg in light Workmen swarm about it like ants
on the queens birthday

ANGLE ON ELI

ELI
(into walkie-talkie)
Wheres the chopper Wed kinda
like to have you join usif you
can find the way

VOICE
(over walkie-talkie)
Fifteen minutes Eli Were just
warming her up

Eli grabs an electric horn from the hand of a passing AD

ELI
All right everybodymay I have
your attention please

Instantly the frantic ADs begin squawking Everybody put down
what youre doing the director wants to talk

ELI

(thru speaker)
This is the one and only Duesenberg
we have in stock When that car
goes into the water were not going
to see it again So once the
action starts no matter what
happens keep it going

ANGLE ON CORTEZ DRESSING ROOM

As Cameron steps out through the open doorway buttoning his
costume

ELI (CONTD)
We must have this shot
Therefore I now order no camera to
jam and no cloud to pass before the
sun

- 144 -

LONG SHOT ON THE DUESENBERG

As Cameron moves toward it uncertainly

Eli some distance away

surrounded by members of his crew glances up

ELI
(yelling)

How ya doin soldier Whered ya
learn to do without sleep

Without awaiting an answer Eli returns to his work

approaches the Duesenberg

CLOSE ON DUESENBERG

as Cameron

Cameron walks around it testing and checking but moving

relentlessly toward the humpback trunk

A horn honks and a police

car slides up Jake leans out the window waves at Cameron

jovially

JAKE

How do you guys get accident
insurance Must cost you an arm and

a leg
(chuckling)
thats a good one

He drives on toward a parked German army

truck in which

several soldiers Chuck approaches Cameron

CHUCK

Youre lookin real strong kid Is

that loose change I hear

jinglin or

are they beginnin to grow

CAMERON
(flatly)
Wanna check

CHUCK

Cmon lemme show you this truck

They walk towards the German truck

CHUCK (CONTD)
Im sending it on ahead
gag its gonna be comin

road towards you when you

Cameron tenses at this information

During the
down the

lounge

CHUCK (CONTD)
Relax what does it change Im
only tellin you so you dont buzz
off into space when you see â€˜em
Theyll be shooting at you and
thats whats supposed to make you
go into the river

Theyve reached the truck where Jake stands proudly The Property
Man is handing out rifles and boxes of bullets to the German
soldiers whom we now recognize as police officers from the town
One cop tying his shoe lifts his head and grins at Cameron like an
old buddy -- the officer from the garage last night

COP
Hey you ever get those pancakes

JAKE
-My boysCant recognize â€˜em
How could I say no after all the
crap theyve taken because of this
company the last six weeks

CHUCK
(good-naturedly )
Yeah a copll do anything for fifty
bucks even be an actor

SECOND COP
These guns are kinda modern for
World War I

PROPERTY MASTER
(to Chuck)
You want me to drive back and get
the old ones

CHUCK
(deciding)
Shitforget it How much1ll they
see from the helicopter

If Cameron was upset by the change in the stunt he is now really
unnerved by the sight of those cops with guns The second cop is
loading cartridges
- 146 -

CAMERON
(starting back to
Duesenberg)
Hope those are really blanks

SECOND COP
(chuckling)
Dont say so on the box

191 ANGLE ON DUESENBERGS TRUNK

As Cameron arrives and casually leans against the trunk and then
gently taps He must get Nina out of there With determination he
reaches for the trunk handle Arms wearing the same costume as his
own reach in holding the trunk closed It is Raymond

RAYMOND
No need to look If she loves
you shes still there If she
doesntthen it doesnt really
matterdoes it

How can he know -- Everything is out of control -- a voice calls

TECHNICIANS VOICE
Hey Lucky we need you

He turns and moves numbly to the car door

TECHNICIAN (CONTâ€™D)
Get in will ya

Dazed Cameron climbs behind the wheel
192 INT DUESENBERG

TECHNICIAN (CONTâ€™D)
(leaning in passengers
side)
Look straight ahead can you see
that red light out of the corner of
your eye

A tiny red light is mounted in the corner over the windshield

TECHNICIAN (CONTD)
Thatll let you know when the films
running so be sure you dont turn
your face to the camera
- 147 -

The technician tightens a final screw on the red light then leaning
back out of the car yells OS

TECHNICIAN (CONTD)
All right bump it once
(to Cameron)
Does it work

Cameron barely hearing looks straight ahead without response
Jake lounges at the drivers window kibitzing the operation

TECHNICIAN (CONTD)
(yells OS)
Bump it again
(looks back into the car)
CAMERA ON

CAMERON
(by reflex)
What

The words CAMERA ON sound exactly like CAMERON It sounded as
though his real name was called and he automatically answered Has
his identity been exposed His eyes widen The technician getting
no response calls to Jake

TECHNICIAN
Ask him if its on

JAKE
Cameron

He whirls to see Jake staring at him His hand darts to the
ignition key the engine roars to life

JAKE (CONTD)

(startled)
Hey they wanna know is the CAMERA
ON
Cameron realizes his error but its too late hes in a panic In
his mind hes given himself away The road ahead is clear -- GO
He jams the car in gear and slams the accelerator to the floor The
Duesenberg leaps forward screeching wildly In its wake -- chaos

Everyone running yelling
CHUCK
(yelling)

That crazy bastard Who cued him

AD

INT DUESENBERG
Speed The needle hits sixty-five -- seventy -- climbing fast

Cameron grips the wheel looking at that empty road An involuntary
shout swells up and escapes his mouth

CAMERON
(exultantly)
Yahooo
(toward Nina in the
trunk)
Hang on to everything baby were
on our way You okay

The needle hits eighty -- eighty-five Ahead the bridge is rushing
toward us Now the arches of the stone railing are strobing past
Through them he sees the black river which he has escaped
Triumphantly his hand rises middle finger extended Suddenly the
red camera light goes on the underwater camera behind him begins
whirring He moves his finger behind him for a perfect close-up
(recalling that moment in the tower)

CAMERON
(screaming)
Shoot this Eli
The center of the bridge is an instant away an approaching blur

EXT ROADSIDE - ANGLE ON TECHNICIAN

Crouching -- tensely watching the chalk line on the road as the
Duesenberg flashes past His finger presses a button

INSERT - FRONT WHEEL OF DUESENBERG

- 149 -

Blam The whole front wheel of the car is blown off by an explosive
charge

ANOTHER ANGLE

The Duesenberg drops on one axle Metal screams against stone as
though it were Cameron himself screaming Skidding spinning
tearing through the papier-mache railing plunging out of control
into space where it hovers for a brief instant and arcs downward
like a dying bird

INT DUESENBERG - CLOSE ON CAMERON
A cry of such anguish and despair

CAMERON
(screaming)
Ninaaa-a-a-a-a-

INT DUESENBERG - WIDE ANGLE PAST CAMERON THROUGH WINDSHIELD

The river rushes up and the car smashes into it with a deafening
shattering roar plunging beneath the surface to a dark and
soundless world -- except for a tiny red light the whir of a camera
and Camerons desperate cries Tearing his seatbelt off he flings
himself toward the rear of the car clawing at the back seat to
reach Nina Incredibly there is sunlight again as the car is
buoyed to the surface There again is the living world - the
road the trees In that brief instant through the rear window
Cameron has a wild tilted glimpse of a pink pinafore -- Nina
standing by the rail looking down Eli beside her The car noses
downward water rising swiftly over the rear window The last image
on Camerons retina is that wild eager little-girl excitement on
Ninas face Then hes alone again entombed in the darkening water
as the car plunges toward the bottom

Cameron sits immobilized at the realization that his betrayal is
total Everyone even Nina has conspired to bring him to this --
red light glowing camera whirring to capture the moment of his
death

- 150 -

Outrage galvanizes him to action He reaches for the door handles
to rip them open -- they snap off in his hands Now there is a
rumbling and rending of metal as the roof begins to implode
crushing down toward him Under the immense pressure the rear
window bursts inward the river rushing in a wild torrent The
memory of Chucks voicethe windows He lowers the front window
slowly The water now pours in faster The level has risen to his
chin He gasps a final breath and the water rises over his head
Still the red light burns He reaches beneath the seat for the
oxygen cylinder and tries to pull it loose It wont move The
impact of the car hitting the water has bent the seat frame His
groping hand finds the hose the oxygen mask A hope Though every
second is robbing his chance for life his movements under water are
as in slow motion Pulling the mask to his face he takes an eager
breath and chokes as water fills his mouth The rubber tube has
broken loose from the cylinder and is floating free -- as it must
have with Burt Pressure of the onrushing water has stopped as the
water reaches the roof For a moment there is a strange stillness
which Cameron his lungs bursting swims through out the window and
toward the surface

ANGLE ON CAMERON

Moving upward through river slime in a world that grows lighter in
a desperate race to reach air

Daylight Gasping half unconscious barely able to move his arms
to stay afloat Adrift in the current he touches land clawing at
the rocks and pulling himself onto the shore His muscles still
moving by motor reflex driven by survival instinct take him
crawling from the river bank through the tall grass -- still the
fugitive the man on the run Then he lifts his head and stops
at what he sees before him

POV

Fanned out across the field is a row of men guns held ready
Policemen from the truck in their German uniforms moving forward
slowly -- carefully searching the terrain in an arch which as it
closes must irrevocably reach Cameron

ANOTHER ANGLE

Its over Without strength or will he lies waiting for them as
though his eyes were made of glass They see him now but their
pace doesnt change As they take the last few steps toward him he
sees their shoulders waists knees and then only a circle of feet
around him

Their hands roughly grab him pulling him to his feet shoving him

gentle Why is that cop smiling Some of them are walking away
Where are the handcuffs Why is he shaking my hand instead Then
the jumble of voices is becoming clearerNo matter what they pay
you make em give you a raiseFantastic my wife thinks being
a cop is dangerous -- you guys are terrific It finally sinks in
the insane absurd devastating humiliating realization that it was
all just another scene in a movie that came off as planned

He is alive and free Is that gurgle we hear in Camerons throat
the water that he swallowed or an unseemly giggle Then it chokes
into laughter

POV

Here comes Chuck running across the field with his silly stunt bag
filled with elastic bandages How funny Heres the helicopter
hovering with Gabe descending the rope ladder bearing film for Eli
who runs to meet him How hilarious Theres the pink
pinaforeNina holding the skirt up to her waist as she wades
through the tall grass towards him How sweetly absurd

AD
All right come onlets get the
stuff in the trucks were losing
sun

ANGLE ON CAMERON

Chuck has reached Cameron throwing a blanket over him He pulls a
pint from his back pocket

CHUCK
Take a belt Dont be stingy

As Cameron tilts his head back the bottle to his mouth he sees
skin divers setting down their rescue equipment and stripping out of
their dripping wet-suits

CAMERON
Those guys down there the whole
time

Chuck who is rubbing Cameron violently through the blanket to
restore his circulation replies with the highest compliment he can

pay

CHUCK
I cant hear yatheyre clangin
too loud

204 ANOTHER ANGLE

Nina has reached an impasse twenty yards away in her journey of love
toward Cameron -- a muddy section of swamp

NINA
(shouts across the
distance to Cameron)
I cant come any further What
should I do I1l get the dress all
muddy and I need it for the next
scene

CAMERON
(grinning with good
nature)
Tunafish saladI know

NINA
(shouts )
They found me five minutes after you
left I felt ridiculous

CAMERON
(waves back)
Just as well

NINA

(shouts )
When Eli told me youd changed your
mind and decided to do the stunt at
first I didnt believe him but I
guess you really did I tried to
find you

Eli is standing nearby listening to this macabre exchange between
lovers

NINA (CONTD)
(to include Eli)
Im sure glad you two made up Boy
Lucky were you wonderfulI guess
I have to go now See you after

She awkwardly turns her dress still held high and yells back over
her shoulder

NINA (CONTD)
- 153 -

Im sorry I was so nutty last night
I always get crazy at the end of a
film

Nina continues picking her way toward the road And then
CLOSE ON NINA

Suddenly she turns running headlong pell-mell across the swamp and
through the mud holes drenching her pink pinafore into a muddy rag
losing a shoe ripping her hose -- and then wildly into the arms of
Cameron smearing him with love and mud And then just as quickly
she is gone racing back across the field hopping like a rabbit
without her shoe toward the road

ANOTHER ANGLE

Cameron is brimming with pleasure Chuck totally ignored picks up
his stunt bag

CHUCK
(dryly)
Lover I think your circulations
back to normal And please next
time will ya listen for the cue --
the word is action

He walks off leaving Cameron draped in the blanket like an Indian
Eli steps up to him looking very serious lifts his hand in the
Indian sign of greeting and says

ELI
How I have always had a great
compassion for your people Long
before it was popular I felt a
repugnance for General Custer

Cameron stares at him incredulous

ELI (CONTD)
My God I think hes breathing
Therere days I cant do anything
right I hope this doesnt screw up
our relationship your being alive
and all
- 154 -

CAMERON
(shaking his head)
Â»You sure took a hell of a chance
Eliwhy didnt you just let me go
last night

ELI
What with Nina in the trunk Ive
got scenes to shoot with her

CAMERON
-All right This morning then
Chuck could have done the stunt

ELI

(thoughtfully)
I knew a guy who made an anti-war
film When they previewed it in his
hometown army enlistment went up
six hundred percent Im making
this film trying to convince the
whole world that maybe theres a
better way to get home for
Thanksgivingand I cant even
convince one dumb kid with a
tattooI couldnt have you run
around paranoid the rest of your
life thinking I was trying to kill
you

CAMERON
Paranoid

Sam has run up out of breath followed by crew members
ELI
Hey Sam the kid just licked your

screenplay He named the disease

SAM

ELI
-a social disease very common

SAM
-like gonorrhea
- 155 -

ELI

wayby screwing your fellow man

CAMERON
I hope you find an easier cure
That was the hardest thousand bucks
I ever made

A horn honks It is Jake who in his enthusiasm has driven the
police car bumping over the marshes to Eli and Cameron

JAKE
You guys want a ride back

ELI
(moving toward the
helicopter )
No were goin in the chopper

CAMERON
(considers it)
Thanks Eli but that looks too
dangerous I think Ill ride with
Jake Good luck with the picture

He moves toward police car

ELI
(yelling to Cameron)
Dont miss that plane Burt

JAKE
(leaning across Cameron
to yell at Eli)
He better not Any member of your
company found within city limits
after five oclock tonight gets
shot on sight

Eli stops suddenly registering what Cameron had said
ELI
--What thousand bucks That stunt

CAMERON
(surprised)

Chuck told me a thousand

ELI
- 156 -

(firmly)

CAMERON
(getting upset)

ELI
(relenting)
Okay seven-fifty Split the
difference
CAMERON

ELI
(exasperated)

(striding toward the
chopper shouting)

Eli is climbing into the helicopter
