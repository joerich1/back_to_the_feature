EXT CITY - DAY

CREDITS OVER

Businessmen and women fill the sidewalks clutching their
winter coats shut Most wear gloves and hats though they
provide little respite from the blustery Midwestern winds
Salt-stained Taxis jockey for position Steam billows from

manhole covers and metal grates Metro train cars filled to
capacity howl across the frigid track

HIGH-RISE BUILDING

The revolving door spins like a carousel filled with the
briefcase-carrying denizens of this busy financial center

A sign situated high above the front security desk
“STARKWEATHER FINANCIAL”

A large Christmas wreath hangs above the sign

The elevator door starts to close A hand shoots in stops
it The door reopens

DAVID HARGROVE 27 more handsome than he probably realizes
climbs into the crowded elevator The other occupants barely
move The door closes -- inches from David’s face

DING

WE TRACK WITH DAVID as he

Exits onto his floor

Walks through the cubicle farm past the other middle-income
earners and entry-level employees

Sits down in his cubicle Tosses his car keys into a plastic
cup filled with pocket change next to his small desk clock
that reads 829AM

Pours himself a cup of coffee in the break room

Talks on his office phone while sneaking in bites from a
sandwich

The wall clock shows 130PM

He removes a tall stack of files from a drawer and drops them
on his desk

Talks on the phone some more Stressed out
David’s small desk clock shows 442PM
He enters data into a computer program
Finally lets out a deep sigh
Just another day
END CREDITS

CUT TO
INT STARKWEATHER FINANCIAL - LATER

It’s now dark outside Fluorescent light fills the
antiseptic office People work into the night

The wall clock reads 714PM

David sits at his desk talking on the phone Or better
described being talked to

His tie unloosened his hair mussed he fails in his efforts
to keep stress at bay

DAVID
(into phone)
RightI understand But there’s
so many variables that come into
play in a market like this

The voice from the other end of the phone is unintelligible
but its tone is unmistakably hostile

DAVID (CONTD)
If you’d like we can explore
shifting what’s left in your 401K
intoI see

COREY THOMPSON 28 David’s somewhat overbearing and
audacious friend and coworker overhears the conversation
Tunes in

DAVID (CONTD)
Yes Yes sir I know Christmas is
coming I understand I’m sorry
Mister Dean Truly I’m sorry I
spread the investment risk as wide
as I could

(MORE )
DAVID (CONTD)
It’s just the unfortunate state of
the economy we’re all --

From the other end of the phone we hear the muffled sound of
what sounds a lot like a string of curse words

DAVID (CONTD)
Hello Hello Mister Dean
(sotto)
Shit

David hangs up the phone Buries his face in his hands
Rubs his temples

Corey wheels back in his chair Leans into David’s cubicle

COREY
You lose him

DAVID
What gave it away

David powers down his computer

Corey takes a candy cane off David’s desk Tears open the
plastic wrapper Pops it into his mouth

COREY
Candy canes taste like shit

DAVID
I wouldn’t know

Corey smirks

David looks at himself in the reflection of his powered down
computer monitor His button-down shirt His loosened tie
His messy hair Corey notices his dejected expression

COREY
Hey it’s not your fault

DAVID
(sarcastically)
Oh no who’s fault is it then
(sincere now)
I’ve never even met this guy Just
moved some numbers around on the
computer and now he’s fucked

COREY
Everyone’s fucked So stop moping

David shrugs his acknowledgment
DAVID
Maybe I should have taken today
off

Corey looks across the office Sees EMILY BRANDT 25
attractive chatting with a coworker

COREY
(re Emily)
Ah but then you would have missed
your chance

DAVID
What do you mean

COREY
Today’s her last day

DAVID
She’s quitting

COREY
That’s what I hear

DAVID
No

He watches Emily as she walks back toward her cubicle

COREY
Stop being such a bitch and go ask
her out

DAVID

I tried that a year ago I made an
ass out myself

COREY
Yeah because you couldn’t say the
word date What did you call it
again

DAVID
I asked her if she wanted to meet
up fora gathering

COREY
A gathering What is she a
fucking wizard

DAVID
No idea why I said it
COREY
Youre right you did make an ass
out yourself

David ignores Corey Collects the last of his belongings
COREY (CONTD)
Come on come on -- I’m just

messing with you Go talk to her

DAVID
I can’t

COREY
Why can’t you

DAVID

BecauseI left my balls at home
COREY

Not again
DAVID

Yup right there on the dresser

COREY
Next to your nightgown

DAVID
Right next to it In fact it’s
probably covering them a little
bit keeping them warm

COREY
Like a male penguin

DAVID
Like a male penguin I don’t know
what that means

David grabs his jacket and car keys

DAVID (CONTD)
I’1l see you on Monday

COREY
What about the Christmas party

DAVID
Eh
COREY
Don’t give me “eh” We’re meeting
everyone at Max’s in like twenty
minutes

DAVID

COREY

straight from the office

DAVID
OhI get it now Male penguins

warmlike my balls

COREY

to change the subject -- the
party’s going to be fun

DAVID

COREY

department is Besides I need a
ride

DAVID
You know all those yellow cars out
there It’s crazy all you need to

drive you wherever --

COREY
-- Yeah yeah yeah Just give me
a second I gotta’ take a piss

DAVID
(through a smile)
I’m not going

COREY
Yeah you are You wanna’ know why

David’s already given up Raises his eyebrows to say “Why”
COREY (CONTD)

(re Emily)
Because she’s going too

Corey walks off leaving David to reconsider and then yells
from afar

COREY (CONTD)
This is going to be a big night for
you bro I can feel it

INT MAX’S - LATER

Busy bar scene Young professionals enjoy after-work drinks
at their company Christmas party Some enjoy too many
evidenced by Corey’s obvious inebriation

He and David sit at a table along with coworkers CHRISTIAN
JERRY and LUKE High-ball glasses cover the table Corey’s
iPhone also sits on the table in front of him

Emily stands across the room speaking with friends at the
bar

Back at the table Corey holds court
COREY

So I purposely order the pizza at
like three minutes before

midnight

JERRY
On New Year’s Eve

COREY
Yeah

LUKE

(to the group)
What’s going on for New Year’s this
year

COREY
Who gives a shit I’m not done
with my story

JERRY
It’s going to be Easter by the time
you are

COREY

Yeah whatever Go fuck yourself
Anywaywhere was I

DAVID
New Year’s You ordered a pizza
COREY
Right right So three minutes
passes the ball drops it’s
officially the new year Lo and
behold ten minutes later there’s a
knock on my door

LUKE
Was it the point of the story
finally showing up

David listens in Laughs Glances over at the bar where he
sees Emily She looks back at him Their gaze holds for a
moment but then they both look away

COREY
It was the pizza guy So I tell
him “You better not be charging me
for this I ordered the fucking
thing last year”

The punchline receives a few courtesy chuckles

LUKE
Did you end up paying

COREY
No The kid apologized and --

As Corey plops back down into his seat Corey accidentally
bangs into the table and knocks his iPhone onto the floor
He doesn’t notice

He also spills everyone’s drinks That everyone notices

CHRISTIAN
Ah man What the hell

COREY
Shit My bad my bad

Corey pulls out his wallet Grabs all his cash Calls over
a COCKTAIL WAITRESS

COREY (CONTD)
(hands her all his cash)
Sweetie here Bring a bottle of
tequila to the table Best stuff
you got

COCKTAIL WAITRESS
It’s five more dollars
COREY
Ohum

Corey searches his pockets

David stands up and places a ten dollar bill on the Cocktail
Waitresses’ tray He walks away from the table

WE STAY ON DAVID as he crosses the bar Readies himself
Approaches the bar next to Emily Tries to make his
selection of that spot seem random

He signals the bartender

DAVID
(to the bartender)
Another beer Thanks

He turns and looks at Emily

DAVID
Ohhey Emily

EMILY
Hi David

The bartender brings David his beer

DAVID
(to Emily)
Did you want anything

EMILY
No I’m good thanks I’m leaving
actually

DAVID
I heard that

Emily’s slightly confused

EMILY
You heard I was leaving

DAVID
Yeah Corey told me you got a job
at an NPO

EMILY
Oh rightI did I meant I was
leavingnever mind

DAVID
Well congrats Needed a change I
guess

EMILY

Thanks yeah I think I’ve gone
about as far as I can handle in
finance

DAVID
I know what you mean

Neither of them seems to know where to go from here The
extended silence is a bit awkward

EMILY (CONT’D)
SoI should probably get going

DAVID
Right

EMILY
Thanks for the drink -- well the
offer

DAVID

Of course Yeah And ah you
knowmaybe I’1ll catch you
lateror something

EMILY
Ummyeah

Emily grabs her coat and purse Walks off
David winces Dies a little on the inside
EXT STREET - SECONDS LATER

Cars and taxis speed past Their exhaust mixes with the cold
air clouding up the street

Emily walks from the bar and is instantly hit by an achingly
cold gust of wind She extends a shivering arm to signal a
cab but it passes her by

David exits the bar carrying a winter hat Catches up to
her

DAVID
Emily wait

Emily turns to face who called her Sees it’s David A
hopeful smile crosses her face

DAVID (CONTD)
You forgot your hat

EMILY
Ohthat’s not mine

DAVID
Shit Did I just steal a hat

EMILY
I think you may have

DAVID
Well consider it a going away
presentfrom whoever owns it
EMILY
I’m not going far My new office
is only a few blocks uptown

David goes for broke

DAVID
Want to grab lunch some time

EMILY
Ummm

Crash and burn David quickly recoils

DAVID
It’s cool I understand

EMILY
No no -- I would Sorry I’m
nervous

DAVID

Nervous About what

EMILY
About this About us talking right
now
DAVID
Really
EMILY
Yes

She reaches out to another passing taxi

It too does not stop She grows frustrated Cold She
moves to a spot further down the street David walks with
her

DAVID
Weve talked plenty of times
before

Wearing only his button-down work shirt the cold is already
taking its toll on David He folds his arms for warmth
Tries to rub life back into his limbs

EMILY
At work yeah You’d call me at my
desk ask me about a financial
report but that was it

DAVID
I never cared about the reports

They smile at each other Their breath escapes into the cold
nighttime air

A cab speeds past Emily misses the chance to signal it
Standing in the spot she stood moments ago are two women
The cab stops for them and they climb in

EMILY
(re the missed cab)
Damn it
A bone-chilling gust of wind blows through Emily clutches
her coat closer to her chest and neck David turns away
slightly letting the brunt of the wind hit his back

Once it passes

DAVID
I can give you a ride home

Emily considers it but then
EMILY
I live outside the city It’s
really out of the way
Another cab passes without stopping
DAVID
Come on it’s freezing out here

I’1l grab my jacket and we’1ll go

More cold wind blows through It chills them to the bone

EMILY
That would be great Thanks

He hurries back toward the bar Emily yells over to him
EMILY (CONTD)
You should probably return that
hat
INT MAX’S - MOMENTS LATER

The bar is just as busy as it was when we last left it

David enters --
He places the hat on the back of a chair Leaves it there

Walks to his table An almost full bottle of top-shelf
tequila sits on it along with several empty shot glasses

DAVID
I’m taking off

COREY
Already

David’s lips form a modest smile

DAVID
I’m giving Emily a ride home

The guys at the table applaud
COREY
See And here it is you didn’t
even want to come tonight

David smirks Puts on his winter jacket

DAVID
Ill see you guys on Monday

LUKE
Alright playboy

JERRY
Congrats

David’s about to leave the table He notices that Corey has
put on his own jacket which is half soaked from when he
spilt the drinks
COREY
(patting down his jacket)
Damn

DAVID
What are you doing

Corey puts his jacket over his arm instead
COREY
What do you mean what am I doing

We’re leaving

DAVID
Well I’m leaving

COREY
Yeah And you’re my ride home

DAVID
Can’t you take a cab

COREY
I don’t have any more cash on me

Slightly frustrated David takes out his own wallet
doesn’t have much cash either

COREY (CONTD)
I’1l just go with you now

DAVID
I told you I’m bringing Emily
home

COREY
I know Just drop me off on the
way

DAVID
Corey

COREY

It’1ll take ten minutes

DAVID
You live twenty minutes away

COREY
What am I supposed to do -- walk

DAVID
(sighs )
Okay Let’s go

He

Corey swipes the bottle of tequila off the table and hides it
under his jacket

Off the guys’ chagrined looks

DAVID
What I’m the one who bought it

David walks away toward the exit with Corey following close
behind

EXT ROAD - LATER

A long stretch of darkened suburban road lit by the
occasional street light

Small snow-capped homes appear sporadically The chilled
limbs of wintry trees spread like spindly bony fingers
hovering just above the road

A set of headlights cut through the darkness
INT CAR - CONTINUOUS

David drives as Emily rides in the passenger seat doing her
best to warm her hands near the dashboard vents

She stares out the window watching the dark world outside
speed past her

Corey sits in the backseat his bottle of tequila in hand
He sips from it as he talks unnecessarily loudly on a cell
phone

COREY
(into phone)
Check my seat Nothing How about
under the table Yeah Yeah it’s
an iPhone Nice Leave it on my
desk tomorrow Luke Leave
ityou there Yo

Corey looks at the cell phone It’s powered down
COREY (CONTD)
(to David re the phone)
Your battery’s dead
David plugs his car charger into the cigarette lighter
DAVID

(re the cell phone)
Let me see it

David reaches his hand behind him but Corey throws the phone
over David’s shoulder onto the front seat It lands on the
floor in a small crevice on the side of the seat

DAVID
Dude

David reaches for the phone but his hand doesn’t fit He
gives up Leaves it there

They continue driving David looks over at Emily who keeps
her hands pressed against the heating vents He slides off
his jacket

DAVID
(placing the jacket over
her lap like a blanket)
Here

EMILY
(smiles)
Thanks

DAVID (CONTD)
I’m sorry by the way

EMILY
For what

DAVID
I realize this is out of the way

EMILY
It’s fine Honestly
(beat)
I’m enjoying the company

David and Emily share a flirtatious smirk
From the backseat loudly
COREY
It’s true I am good company Take

this left

Corey tells David to take the turn just as he reaches the
street David swerves slightly but readjusts

COREY (CONT’D)
Don’t worry about it You can take
the next one

David continues driving
After a beat

COREY (CONTD)
I’m starving

No response Corey tries again

COREY (CONT’D)
You know what I’m saying

DAVID

Yeah that you’re hungry I get

it
COREY

Let’s grab something to eat
DAVID

It’s after midnight
COREY

And What am I a fuckin’ gremlin
EMILY

Yes

David smirks

DAVID

Eat at home

COREY
I don’t have anything C’mon just
stop somewhere

DAVID
Nothing’s open

COREY
There’s a pizza place near here
that serves slices till two

Corey’s clearly too drunk to be getting the hint
tries a more direct approach

DAVID
I kind of want to you know bring
Emily home

COREY
Itll take two seconds I swear
I‘1l stop this masterclass in cock-
blocking right after that

David

David looks at Emily She laughs David ends up doing the
same

DAVID
Youre killing me right now
COREY
Cool Oh yeah I need to stop at
an ATM
DAVID

Just use your debit card

COREY
They only take cashunless you
wanna’ spot me --

DAVID
Where’s the ATM

EXT SUPERMARKET PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER

Large and dark the lot is a vast expanse of empty area
Yellow lines demarcate the hundreds of parking spaces though
none are occupied

It’s quite barren Eerie Not the best part of town
either

The supermarket is closed for the night A long frozen
industrial hose snakes from the building to the rows of
Douglas-fir trees lined near its entrance

The trees’ chilled limbs dance in the strong winds
Festooned above them a large banner reads “CHRISTMAS TREES
FOR SALE”

Nearby beneath the supermarket’s main sign is a large time
and temperature sign Current time 118am Temperature
negative 3 degrees Fahrenheit

Across from the supermarket in a remote area of the parking
lot sits a standalone ATM vestibule owned by BANK OF THE
MIDWEST The large glass-encased ATM vestibule remains open
for 24-hour use

David’s car pulls up near the ATM vestibule Not far but
not exactly close either

INT CAR - MOMENTS LATER

Emily opens her door lLeans her seat forward Corey
squeezes through squashing Emily in the process

COREY
I’1l be back in a second

Leaving his damp jacket in the car Corey hurries over to the
entrance

The ATM vestibule shines like a beacon in the otherwise
darkened parking lot Its many windows are partially frosted
from the extreme cold

Corey takes a long pull from the bottle of tequila he brings
with him

David and Emily watch from the car as Corey inserts his ATM
card into the outside security reader He pulls open the door
and he enters Neither says a word at first Silence save
for the idling engine and the steady sound of heat escaping
the vents

DAVID
I’1l make sure he’s fast at the
pizza place

EMILY
I really don’t mind

DAVID
They actually make pretty decent
pizza The mushroom and um and
somethinggarlic I think is
pretty good They cook it all up
and stuff It’s good

Off David’s stammering

EMILY
I thought I was the nervous one

David jokingly puffs up

DAVID
What are you talking about I’m
not nervous

EMILY
Catch you later

DAVID
Well that was -- okay I was a
little nervous then but

EMILY
I like it It’s cute

Emily smiles She notices a pewter clip -- featuring Saint
Christopher -- attached to David’s visor

EMILY (CONTD)
(re the clip)
What’s that

David seems slightly embarrassed

DAVID
Oh it’s nothing

Emily leans in and reads the inscription Her shoulder
touches David’s Her touch electrifies him

EMILY
“Protect me and my passengers and
all who pass by with a steady hand
and a watchful eye”

DAVID
It’s stupid I don’t know why I
even have it

EMILY
I think it’s nice There’s nothing
wrong with having a little faith

Their conversation is interrupted by the distant sight of
Corey in the ATM vestibule It’s clear by his body language
that he’s aggravated about something

DAVID (CONTD)
(re Corey)
Ugggwhat is it now

Corey turns to face them Throws his hands up in resigned
defeat

DAVID (CONTD)
Youve got to be kidding me

David gets out of the car Leaves his jacket behind on
Emilys lap Jogs over to the ATM vestibule

WE STAY ON EMILY as she watches David using his own ATM card
to let himself into the vestibule He and Corey have a brief
discussion ending with Davids obvious displeasure

Emily looks around while holding her cold hands closer to the
heat The emptiness and dark surroundings make her visibly
uneasy

After a moment she turns off the car Removes the keys from
the ignition Still wearing her coat she exits the car and
hurries over the ATM WE SEE that she left behind her purse

Corey opens the door and lets her into

INT ATM VESTIBULE - CONTINUOUS

Large both in length and height the vestibule is quite
roomy inside Close to fifteen feet across Thirteen feet
high ceilings

Glass windows cover three sides of the rectangle shaped
vestibule Its fourth side is a dull white plaster wall
cluttered with Bank of the Midwest advertisements Off to

one side of this wall is an Automated Teller Machine (ATM)

David stands at the ATM going through the process of getting
cash

INSERT - The POV from the silent black and white video
camera situated in the ATM

David with Emily and Corey in the background stands in
front of the ATM He punches in his PIN

BACK TO SCENE

COREY
(to Emily)
What’s wrong
EMILY
Nothing I didn’t want to wait in
the car
DAVID

I’1l just be a second

EMILY
(to David)
Why are you taking out money

David rolls his eyes over in Corey’s direction Corey
notices

COREY
Cockhead I’1ll pay you back
(to Emily kinder)
The magnetic strip on my card’s
messed up

EMILY
Cockhead

COREY
Just a little pet name I have for
him

Emily chuckles Corey who left his coat in the car blows
into his hands for warmth

COREY (CONTD)
It’s freakin’ freezing in here

Emily agrees with a nod Corey places his cold hands against
a small heating vent located along the bottom of the plaster
wall It offers a small amount of relief

Transaction complete David takes his cash Grabs his
receipt Throws it in a waste basket

DAVID (CONTD)
All set let’s go

Leading the way Emily places her hand on the vestibule door -
- on the EXIT LEVER She’s about to press the lever and open
the door when suddenly --

-- she stops

Corey and David look at her

COREY
What

She doesn’t move Not a muscle Her eyes are fixed on
something straight ahead in the dark parking lot

Corey and David turn their attention to what she stares at
Standing there about thirty feet from the door is a MAN A
formidably sized man at that Shrouded in darkness wearing
a heavy hooded parka

He doesn’t move -- he simply stands and stares

WE CANNOT SEE his face only the faint wisps of steam as they
curl from his mouth in the cold winter air

David Emily and Corey stop dead in their tracks They never
exit the vestibule

DAVID
Who the hell is that

David looks at his own hand which is full of cash
Practically on display

He quickly stuffs the cash into his pocket

COREY
Who gives a shit Let’s go

Corey puts his hands on the door about to open it and exit

David warily grabs Cory by the shirt

DAVID
No wait

COREY
For what

DAVID

Just wait

Corey stands down The three of them stare outside at the
Man

He stares back

DAVID (CONTD)
Why’s he out there

COREY
He’s probably waiting to use the
ATM

EMILY

Why didn’t he come in then

COREY
Who cares I’m freezing Let’s
go

DAVID

Damn it Corey Wait
Corey stops Let’s out an annoyed sigh
COREY
The fucking guy wants to use the
ATM Big deal

EMILY
Where’s his card

COREY
Probably in his wallet

DAVID
What if he wants to rob us
COREY
He’s not here to rob us

DAVID

Corey it’s one in the morning
Why would this guy be in the middle

of an empty parking lot

COREY
(re the ATM)
The same reason we’re here

DAVID

Did we walk here Alone

Corey looks at the Man for a beat C

assertion
After a beat

COREY
This is retarded

Corey opens the door and starts to ex
does --

-- the Man takes a step closer to the

After a
Clo

Seeing this Corey freezes
steps back inside the vestibule

EMILY

What was that Why did he

COREY

onsiders Davids

I’m leaving

it The very second he

ATM vestibule
beat he then slowly

ses the door

do that

Maybemaybe he thought we were
done so he could finally come in

They wait Continue to look outside
same right back at them
EMILY
Should we call the police
COREY
No
EMILY
(to David)

I think we should

David doesn’t respond He holds his

at the Man He does the

attention on the Man

COREY
Let’s just ask him why he’s here
then

EMILY
No

DAVID

Corey no
Corey knocks on the glass Calls out to the Man

COREY
Hey buddy You waiting to use the
ATM

The Man does not respond He continues to stand and stare
Unflinchingly

EMILY
(unnerved)
What does he want then

DAVID
Probably our money
(beat)
Does he have anything on him Can
you see

EMILY
II can’t tell

COREY
Are you guys serious right now
Who cares about this jerk-off
Let’s go

DAVID
Says the guy who just got scared
back into the booth

COREY
Whatever If we all leave at once
well be fine Come on

Corey puts his hands on the door prepared to exit David
grabs onto him again

DAVID
Wait -- will you just wait

Corey shakes Davids grip off of him

COREY
For what I want to go eat

David looks outside The Man stares back still standing in
the same spot in the parking lot

DAVID
He’s justwatching us

OUTSIDE THE VESTIBULE

The Man stands and stares at David Emily and Corey They
stare out at him

INSIDE THE VESTIBULE

Emily David and Corey keep their attention on the Man
Confused Slightly fearful Growing colder with each
passing minute

EMILY
Maybe he’s homeless

COREY
He probably is So give hima fin
and let’s call it a night

DAVID
He doesn’t look homeless

COREY
What makes someone not look
homeless

DAVID
When they’re that big

Just then the Man’s head WHIPS around A faint jingling
sound grows louder and louder Someone’s coming

OUTSIDE THE VESTIBULE

ROBERT 43 a random man walking his dog ambles through the
parking lot a hundred feet or so behind the Man A
medallion on his Golden Retriever’s collar jingles with each
step

ROBERT
(to his dog)
Alright go ahead

Robert lets go of the dog’s leash It runs off into the
dark

INSIDE THE VESTIBULE

David Emily and Corey watch as Robert comes into view
The Man walks over to Robert with a determined step
OUTSIDE THE VESTIBULE

Robert stands and waits for his dog to return Bounces on
the balls of his feet to keep warm

He then notices David Emily and Corey in the ATM vestibule
They all stand at the door watching intently He appears to
find this somewhat odd

Robert then sees the Man approaching

ROBERT
How’s it going

The Man continues toward him Doesn’t say a word
ROBERT (CONTD)
Just letting my dog do his

business

The Man continues his approach undeterred Robert suddenly
appears to feel slightly threatened

ROBERT (CONTD)
Is thereuh something I can help
you --

SMASH Without a moment of hesitation the Man PUNCHES
Robert in the face Drops him

INSIDE THE VESTIBULE

EMILY
Oh my God

David bangs against the glass trying to stop the Man

DAVID
Hey Hey

OUTSIDE THE VESTIBULE

The Man GRABS Robert’s head in his big meaty hands wrapped
in dark leather gloves and --

-- SMASH-SMASH Against the concrete Like an animal
Blood trickles out from Robert’s head

INSIDE THE VESTIBULE

COREY
Holy shit Did you see that Did
you see that

EMILY
David

OUTSIDE THE VESTIBULE

The Man removes Robert’s wallet from his back pocket
Doesnt open it Stuffs it into his own jacket pocket

He leaves Robert’s bloodied body in the middle of the parking
lot No care No remorse

He walks back toward the vestibule

Well behind him Robert’s Golden Retriever returns Nudges
him a few times with his snout Whimpers Robert doesn’t
move The dog walks away its leash dragging behind on the
ground

INSIDE THE VESTIBULE

They watch in horror as the Man returns to where he was
originally standing He plants himself there As if nothing
happened

David frantically reaches into his pocket Searches
Nothing Reaches into his other pocket Same result

DAVID
Damn it
(to Emily and Corey)
Call nine-one-one Call them

Corey throws his hands up He doesn’t have his phone
remember David looks to Emily

She sheepishly answers

EMILY
My phone’s in my purse

DAVID
Where’s your purse

Emily looks outside

EMILY
In the car

Corey starts frantically looking around next to the ATM

COREY
(running his fingers along
the underside of the ATM)
Don’t they have panic buttons in
these things

EMILY
Yeah they must

They all join in looking for the button but can’t find it

DAVID
Shit what about a hard line

COREY
What do you mean

DAVID
I don’t know like an elevator
phone A speaker thing that
connects directly to the bank

COREY
Right right

They all continue looking around but still they find
nothing

EMILY
This can’t be happening

But it is The three of them stare at each other all
pleading for an idea They’ve got nothing

The gravity of the situation fully takes hold

FADE TO
EXT SUPERMARKET PARKING LOT - LATER
Chilling winds scream through the empty lot knocking one of
the Christmas trees over A small chain fastened to its
trunk keeps it from blowing away

A few pieces of trash roll about like suburban tumbleweed

The time and temperature sign provides its update Current
time 152am Temperature negative 5 degrees Fahrenheit

The ATM vestibule sits in the distance aglow in the dark
winter night

INT ATM VESTIBULE - CONTINUOUS

David paces back and forth futilely hugging his arms close
to his body for warmth

Corey kneels near the wall his hands near the heating vent
He takes a warming sip from the bottle of tequila

Emily clenches her jacket closed as she stares into the
parking lot Her teeth chatter behind her dry pallid lips

She can’t take her frightened eyes off the Man who slowly
circles the vestibule like a shark A predator

DAVID
There has to be something
Something we can do to I don’t
know get someone’s attention

COREY
Who There’s no one else out
there

DAVID

There was that guy with his dog

COREY
And look what happened to him

David takes this into account
EMILY
(re the Man)

Why hasn’t he come in here

Corey and David look outside at the Man Study him as they
talk to each other

DAVID
Maybe he doesn’t have an ATM card

EMILY
Why would that stop him

DAVID
You need it for the buzzer thing

COREY
What if the dog guy has one

DAVID
Has he checked

COREY
How the fuck should I know

Their concern escalates

EMILY
What are we going to do

David looks over at the car It’s parked a good distance
away

DAVID
Where are my keys

Emily digs into her jacket pocket Removes David’s keys as
well as a tube of lipstick She hands David his keys

DAVID (CONTD)
Maybe I can get to the car

COREY
Youll never make it

DAVID
You don’t know that

COREY
David the guy’s right there
Youll be lucky to get within ten
feet of it
OUTSIDE THE VESTIBULE

The Man notices that all three of them look in the direction
of the car It’s obvious what they’re considering

He walks toward the car
INSIDE THE VESTIBULE

EMILY
What’s he doing

DAVID
Shit -- I think he heard us

OUTSIDE THE VESTIBULE
The Man opens the driver’s side door Leans in Fiddles
around near the steering wheel though WE CANNOT SEE what

he’s doing

He then pushes a button to pop the trunk Closes the
drivers side door

After standing in front of it for a moment -- with his back
facing the vestibule -- he then retreats to the back of the
car

Opens the trunk A faint light emits from a small bulb The
Man carelessly rummages through the junk inside throwing
much of it to the ground including an old folding lawn
chair

He finds a tire iron apparently what he was looking for
Grabs it He then spots a small tool kit Takes that too

INSIDE THE VESTIBULE

They watch as the Man closes the trunk carrying the tire
iron and tool kit

He walks away from the car toward the vestibule Continues
walking until he’s out of sight presumably behind the
vestibule

COREY
Is he leaving

David places his face against where the last pane of glass
meets the plaster wall trying to see the Man

DAVID
NoI can’t tell I think he went
around back Shit

David peels away from the window

EMILY
What should we do

They all look at one other At the car At the open parking
lot

Decision time

INSERT - The POV from the silent black and white security
camera in the ATM

David Emily and Corey stand near one another looking
unnerved Discomposed Scared

BACK TO SCENE
Still no sign of the Man

Silence except for the steady hum of the small rotor in the
heating vent

Davids foot lifts from the floor Slowly It lands one
step closer to the door

He waits a second for a reaction of some kind But there’s
none Has the Man left

As David begins to take another step --
-- BANG

The sound of metal striking metal Coming from the back of
the vestibule behind the plaster wall

David Emily and Corey WHIP around to face the plaster wall
BANG-BANG-BANG-BANG-BANG It echoes through the vestibule
Followed by a screeching sound Metal scraping metal
David waits a beat and then
DAVID
(to Emily hushed)

Your cell phoneyou’re positive

it’s in your purse
Emily nods

DAVID (CONTD)
On the front seat

Corey looks over at David figuring out what he’s driving at

COREY
No

DAVID
He’s back there By the time he
gets around the booth I’11 be
halfway to the car

COREY
And what about the other half of
the way
BANG-BANG-BANG Even louder this time

Emily Corey and David watch as the plaster wall rattles
slightly

Followed only by the continuous hum of the heating vent

And then the faint sound of what sounds like a metal object
being dropped onto the ground is heard

EMILY
(hushed)
He has a gun

David shakes his head

DAVID
He would have shot at us by now
COREY
This glass is probably bullet-
proof
DAVID

No it’s not

EMILY
We should just wait It’ll be light
out soon This parking lot will be
filled with people

DAVID
The sun won’t be up for hours
Well be lucky if we don’t freeze
to death before then

David’s right The clouds of breath that escape his mouth
are proof of this

COREY
This is fucking insane

Corey rests his head against the glass Defeated
EMILY
(pleading with her eyes)

It’s too dangerous

David meets Emily’s heartfelt stare His adrenaline is
momentarily stifled as he considers what to do

And then --

-- POOF-POOF-POOF

The overhead fluorescent lights blow out in succession The
vestibule turns almost pitch black inside save for the light

of the ATM display screen

DAVID
Terrific

After a few short BEEPS the emergency lights kick in They
are not nearly as bright The vestibule remains quite dark

COREY
What the hell was that What
happened

DAVID

He cut the power

EMILY
Oh no

David and Corey turn to see what concerns Emily She’s
crouched down near the heating vent

It’s silent

COREY
Nono no

Corey bangs the bottom of his fist against the vent
Nothing

COREY (CONTD)
Shit

DAVID
He’s back

Corey lifts his head Sees that the Man is back in view He
stands about fifteen feet from the vestibule

And then something occurs to David
Looking at the glass window pane --

DAVID
Waitwait-wait-wait

EMILY
What is it

Without explanation David suddenly bangs against the frosty
windows several times Hard But the glass shows no sign of
compromise

EMILY (CONTD)
What are you doing

DAVID
The glass -- there’s got to be an
alarm on it or something

David bangs harder all to no avail

EMILY
But if you break it he’1l be able
to get in
She’s got a point

DAVID
All rightthen something else

David looks around the vestibule His eyes lock on the
plaster wall

He KICKS at it Repeatedly Frantically
It dents Deforms

Cory joins in SMASHES his shoulder into the plaster wall
over and over again

Pieces of drywall fall to the ground But still no alarm

DAVID
Damn it

Emily’s eyes drift upward Something catches her attention

EMILY
Wait
David and Corey stop
DAVID
What
EMILY

Those will have an alarm

David looks up to where Emily stares He sees what she sees
the emergency fire sprinklers

EMILY (CONTD)
Do you have a lighter

DAVID
Shit No
(to Corey)
You
Corey shakes his head “No”

Out of breath David looks at the ATM itself Without any
hesitation he storms over to it

WHAM He delivers a KICK right at it Nothing

BACK TO SCENE
OUTSIDE THE VESTIBULE
The Man watches the chaos from the shadows

David finally gives up Corey does the same They fight to
catch their breath

Slightly muffled by the glass

DAVID
Come on

INSIDE THE VESTIBULE

David is at a loss Still laboring to catch his breath in
the cold air he slowly approaches the glass Sees something
in the distance His eyes widen

He bangs the glass Yells out

DAVID
Hey Hey Over here
Emily and Corey see what David is looking at a car -- with
emergency lights on its roof It has just pulled into the
distant entrance of the parking lot

COREY
It’s the cops

EMILY
Hey Help us

But the car circles back around never coming close to the
bank

DAVID
No

EMILY
Come back Please

The car’s taillights disappear into the night behind the
cover of white cloud exhaust It’s too late -- it’s gone

None of them have a clue what to do next
After a beat

EMILY (CONT’D)
I’m so cold

DAVID
Me too

Emily paces to the other side of the vestibule Shivers

DAVID (CONTD)
(to Corey)
How much do you have in your
account

COREY
I’m not sure Why

DAVID
Ive got close to three grand

David approaches the ATM Inserts his card
buttons

COREY
You’re not going to give this
asshole money

DAVID
He just fucking beat a guy to
death Corey If it means us
getting out of here alive
absolutely

Something’s wrong

DAVID (CONTD)
Damn

EMILY
What is it

DAVID
(re the ATM)
It’ll only let me take out four
hundred

EMILY
Why

DAVID
I already took out a hundred
There’s a daily limit

Punches

David goes forward with the withdrawal anyway

DAVID (CONTD)

(to Corey)
You take out five hundred too
Maybe a thousand will be enough

David grabs his cash Takes back his ATM card

COREY
I told you my card’s not working

DAVID
Shit That’s right

David gives Corey a once-over Notices his watch

DAVID
What about that

COREY
What

DAVID
Your watch

COREY
No fucking way am I giving this to
him

Emily takes off her diamond stud earrings

EMILY
Here Take these

David looks down at the earrings After a beat he
reluctantly takes them

DAVID
(to Corey)
It’s just a watch Corey

COREY
The thing’s been in my family
forever I can’t

DAVID
Look I know it’s important to you
butwe need it

COREY
No I’m not doing it

DAVID
You’re unbelievable

COREY
Fine I’m unbelievable

David gives up Stares at the cash and earrings he holds in
hand clearly questioning if it is going to be enough

Now what

Emily huddles her arms close to her body for warmth She
trembles As she stares outside almost in a state of
catatonia she has a frightening realization

EMILY
(to Corey)
Waitif your card’s not working
how did you get in

COREY
What do you mean

After a moment David appears to figure out what Emily’s
driving at He instantly becomes equally concerned

DAVID
She means if the magnetic strip on
your card’s messed up like you
said it is how were you able to
get past the security buzzer

COREY
Who gives a shit

DAVID
Please tell me you were just being
cheap

COREY
What

David’s panic grows tenfold His words are pleas for
comfort

DAVID
Your card works fine You were
just too cheap to take out money
right Corey

Corey finally gets it evidenced by his sudden look of
disquietude

DAVID (CONTD)
Corey
He slowly shakes his head to say “No”
David and Emily look at each other Fear stains their faces
David takes slow trepidant steps over to the vestibule door
He looks at it Terrified He slowly extends his trembling

hand until his fingertips make contact with the icy glass

Without pressing the EXIT LEVER he gently and ever so
slightly pushes the glass door itself --

-- and it OPENS A chilling wind whistles in through the
small space

His outstretched hand quivers The locking mechanism on the
door is clearly broken

In short The door is unlocked

David looks outside for the Man He’s nowhere in sight But
still did he see this

David nervously pulls back his hand closing the barely-
opened vestibule door

He backs away
After a beat David signals to Corey “Give it”
Corey removes his wristwatch Hands it to David

David approaches a signing shelf affixed to one of the glass
walls of the vestibule He grabs an ATM deposit envelope

Reaching into his pocket he removes all his cash Stuffs it
into the envelope Same for Corey’s watch and Emilys
earrings

Seals the envelope His cold shaking hands make these fine
movements difficult

David signals Emily and Corey over They huddle around him
He holds the deposit envelope in hand

DAVID
I’m going to slide this to the side
of him -- away from the door If

he goes for it we run the other
way toward the main road

COREY
Yeah Okay

It’s apparent that Emily is less confident in the plan

DAVID
(to Emily)
What’s wrong
EMILY
What if there are more of them out
there
COREY

More of what

EMILY
Him

Emily looks outside for the Man

EMILY (CONT’D)
How do we know he’s alone

OUTSIDE THE VESTIBULE

The Man stands at the rear of the vestibule out of their
sight

The tool box the Man removed earlier from David’s trunk is on
the ground Its cover open WE SEE a spool of wire amongst
its contents

In front of him is a steel door encased by a brick wall
that appears to lead inside the vestibule He tries to pry
open the door with the tire iron No luck He then picks up
a screwdriver in one hand and a hammer in the other

The Man places the screwdriver to the already damaged lock
He is about to strike the end of the screwdriver with the
hammer when he overhears Corey David and Emily OFF-SCREEN

He stops Listens It’s difficult to hear them but it
sounds as though they’re having a disagreement over
something

DAVID (0S)
Emily’s right it’s too risky

COREY (0S)
There’s no one else out there

EMILY (0S)
You don’t know that
COREY
Neither do you

DAVID
Ill go alone

EMILY

No David

vestibule but only a few feet outside

OUTSIDE THE VESTIBULE

David opens the door

He looks around Nervous

Halfway
He is hit by a blast of arctic air

His button-down collared shirt does little to keep him warm
The Man slowly emerges from behind the vestibule
David takes a second step outside

David signals them with an apprehensive nod
they’re clearly supposed to -- by closing the door behind

Seconds later he takes a

Ready

He turns around to face

They respond as

For the first time since all this started David is outside
Vulnerable

Scared No sign of the Man

And then from out of the shadows he emerges Standing
approximately twenty feet in front of David his heavy
breaths escape from the hood of his parka

David holds out the envelope

DAVID
There’sthere’s five hundred
dollars in hereplus everything
we have A pair of earrings a
watch It’s yours all of it
Pleasejust let us go

The Man doesn’t react He just continues to stare
Corey and Emily watch nervously from behind the glass

The bitter cold stings David’s cheeks transforming his
breath into vapor
DAVID (CONTD)
We won’t tell the police about any
of this We’ve never even seen
your face soso you can just
take this

David slides the envelope full of valuables across the
concrete off to the side -- away from the door

DAVID (CONTD)
-andyou know disappear Like
nothing happened Okay Is
thatis that okay
The Man is yet to move Silence The tension is palpable
And then after a long beat --
-- the Man takes a step in the direction the envelope

Finally a glimmer of hope

Step by lumbering step the Man gets closer to the envelope --
and further away from David And the car

David surreptitiously removes his car keys from his pocket
Waits the for the right moment to make his move

Waits

DAVID

sprints across the parking lot toward the car
THE MAN

sees him and gives up entirely on the envelope Walks quite
resolutely toward David

DAVID
reaches the car Pulls on the door handle It’s locked He
immediately clicks the unlock button on the key but it

remains locked --

The pewter visor clip of St Christopher

DAVID

looks through the car window at the passenger side That
door is unlocked He turns around to check on

runs around the car Reaches the passenger side Yanks at
the door --

-- it opens Relief Momentary
THE MAN
rounds the front of the car

DAVID

leaps inside Slides over to the driver’s side Inserts the
key into the ignition Turns it --

-- Click Nothing A broken panel exposes torn wires
hanging from the ignition

THE MAN

gets within feet of the passenger side door

DAVID

locks the passenger side door

He then spots Emily’s purse on the floor He hurriedly
rummages through it Finds her cell phone Dials 9-1-1 Is
just abut to press SEND when --

-- SMASH

THE MAN

punches through the passenger side window with his gloved
hand Lunges for David

DAVID

leaps to the driver’s seat Opens the door Is about to
escape when --

THE MAN

unlocks the passenger side door Violently swings it open

Catches hold of David by the neck Yanks him out of the car
in a single pull His strength is impossible

DAVID

falls from the car landing hard on the cold concrete with a
wind-stealing thud Emily’s cell phone falls from his hand

and slides well out of reach

COREY

jumps out of the vestibule keeping one hand on the open
door

COREY
David

THE MAN

looks over at Corey momentarily turning his attention away
from David

DAVID

uses this distraction to climb back into the car The
already open driver’s side door is his only chance He
frantically scurries across the front seat

THE MAN

reaches in the car after David Gets a hold of his shirt
Pulls hard

DAVID

sheds his ripping dress shirt leaving him in a T-shirt and
freeing himself from the Man’s powerful grip He falls out
of the driver’s side door Struggles to get to his feet --
he’s banged-up pretty badly

COREY

reaches his hand out trying to hurry David along

COREY
Hurry

Emily joins Cory outside the vestibule door

EMILY
David run

walks to the front of the car Closes in on David

DAVID

staggers toward the vestibule Notices the cell phone 911
shines brightly on the display waiting for the Send button

to be pressed

COREY

David stops He’s about to change course and go for the
phone

EMILY
David -- no

THE MAN
gets to within eight feet of David

Five feet

Three feet

He’s right on him

He’s just about to grab him when

DAVID

is forced to abandon the phone He changes his course back
toward the vestibule He outstretches his hand fighting
through the pain

Just as the Man is about to latch onto him --

COREY

leans forward and connects with David’s hand He YANKS David
in Hard Pulling him

INSIDE THE VESTIBULE

Corey and Emily SLAM the door shut and hold it closed Grip
the handle with all their might

David falls to the floor holding his ribs Coughing
Bleeding

After a moment of obvious surprise Emily and Corey release
their grip on the door

WE SEE that the Man has discontinued his pursuit Just over
ten feet from the vestibule door

Emily drops to her knees next to David Comes to his aid
Takes off her jacket and wraps David in it leaving her ina
thin blouse

EMILY
David David Are you okay

David labors to get his breath back
Corey watches as the Man walks away from the vestibule into
the darkness Once Corey knows it’s safe he joins Emily at

Davids side

COREY
You all right

David coughs His breath clouds in the cold air He
struggles to regain his faculties

DAVID
Yeah

David hands Emily back her jacket

DAVID (CONTD)
Here

EMILY
You need it

DAVID
So do you

OUTSIDE THE VESTIBULE

The Man picks up Emily’s cell phone He then walks over to
the discarded deposit envelope Picks that up as well

INSIDE THE VESTIBULE

They watch as the Man approaches David’s car Circles around
to the trunk

COREY
What’s he doing

OUTSIDE THE VESTIBULE

The Man reaches into his jacket pocket and removes Robert’s
wallet Tosses it inside the trunk

He then throws the deposit envelope and Emily’s cell phone
into the trunk 911 on the phone’s display screen still
having never been Sent
He SLAMS the trunk shut
INSIDE THE VESTIBULE
They watch the Man
COREY
(exasperated)

Shit

Corey leans against the glass Slides down to the floor
Mentally and physically spent

David and Emily are already seated on the floor They too
have reached their limits

The three of them look at one another from across the
vestibule Shiver uncontrollably Their faces ashen with
grief

No one seems to know what to say Silence is appropriate

Emily stuffs her hands into her jacket pockets for warmth
Finds something -- her tube of lipstick She uncaps it and
approaches the window Writes something on the glass
David and Corey watch her

dark night

camera in the ATM

Her lipstick message falls just outside the camera’s line of
sight

END INSERT

Try as David and Corey might the metal grate’s not budging
Not a chance They give up

DAVID
Son of a bitch

Their speech has begun to thicken They exhibit signs of
cognitive decline Shiver uncontrollably Appear slightly
confused

Early signs of hypothermia

David looks closer at the vent Examines it Stares inside
with a mini key ring flashlight

COREY
What do you see

DAVID
There’s aa room or something

EMILY
A room

David blows into his numb hands in efforts to warm them

DAVID
Yeah It’s small It must be
where they go to restock the ATM

COREY
If there’s a room that means
there’s a door

Corey kneels down next to him Looks inside the small vent

COREY (CONTD)
If we distract him Emily can use
it to sneak out back

DAVID
(re the vent)
There’s no way she’s fitting
through this

Davids right The vent is far too small
Corey looks up at the cracks and dents made earlier in the
plaster wall Digs his fingers in Pulls His tired

frozen muscles keep him from mustering up any real strength

Finally a sizeable chunk of drywall falls to the floor
exposing a brick wall behind it

COREY
Son of a bitch

Emily looks over at the ATM
EMILY
(to David)

Let me see your card

DAVID
I took out as much as I could

EMILY
I know

Her hand stays outstretched David hands it to her

She inserts it into the ATM card slot Looks to David It
takes him a second to realize what she’s waiting for

DAVID
Five nine oh-eight

Emily removes a pen from her coat pocket Says the PIN out
loud as she writes it on the back of a deposit envelope

EMILY
Fiveninezeroeight
Okay

She presses numbers on the ATM keypad In reverse order of
what she wrote down

EMILY
Eightzero

DAVID
Youre doing it backwards

EMILY
I know I remember hearing that if
you enter a pin backwards into an
ATM it automatically alerts the
police It’s some sort of panic
code in case you’re getting robbed

David joins Emily at the ATM Corey stays down near the
heating vent shining the mini key ring flashlight inside

COREY
That’s an urban legend It’s
bullshit

DAVID
(to Corey)
How do you know that

Corey turns off the flashlight Stuffs the keys in his pants
pocket

COREY
Think about it -- what if your pin
was like four two two four
You’re fucked

EMILY
It’s still worth trying

Emily enters the last of the digits Presses ENTER
The display screen reads “INCORRECT PIN” David’s card is
ejected from the card slot A steady BEEP sounds from the

ATM alerting them to remove the card

David is about to retrieve his card when he is distracted by
Corey who climbs to his feet facing the door

COREY
Where did he go

David and Emily turn around to see what Corey is looking at
No one The Man is missing Robert’s body however remains
where it was last seen

DAVID
Did you see him leave

COREY
I just turned around and he wasn’t
there anymore

DAVID
But did you actually see him walk
away

David presses his face against the glass His dilated eyes
frenetically dart in every direction

The ATM continues to beep signaling the need for the card to
be retrieved from the slot

COREY
Who cares This might be our only
chance

DAVID

He could be right around back
COREY

Even if he is we’re less safe in

here than we are out there
DAVID

We’re still alive

(re Robert)
He’s not

COREY
That doesn’t mean shit

Corey puts his hands on the door prepared to exit

EMILY
Corey please no

He stops Disarmed by Emily’s genuine concern for him

EMILY (CONT’D)
Please

He takes his hands off the door Calms down

After a beat

COREY
If he wants to get in here he can

DAVID
He doesn’t know that

COREY
He doesn’t have to use the door
He can smash the glass with a rock
He can drive the damn car right at
us

EMILY
Then why hasn’t he

COREY
I don’t know I don’t know

The ATM finally stops beeping David’s card is swallowed

David taps a few buttons on the ATM Nothing His card is
gone

DAVID
Shit

Emily continues to stare out the windows With her eyes
fixed outside

EMILY
Why’s he doing this to us

DAVID
I don’t know

EMILY
Maybe we did something to him

But what David obviously has no idea

EMILY (CONTD)
Did something happen at the bar

DAVID
Not with me

COREY
Me either
(beat then to David)
Waitwhat about that guy from
work today

DAVID
What guy

COREY
The one screaming at you on the
phone
EMILY
What did you do to him
DAVID
Nothing
COREY

Bullshit nothing You lost half
the money in his 401K three days
before Christmas

DAVID
Yeah I know but
(re the Man)
This guy isn’t him

COREY
How do you know

DAVID
Because I know

COREY
You said it yourself You’ve never
met him in person

DAVID
No but I do know he’s in his
sixties If anything this guy
could be any one of the thousands
of people you piss off daily

Emily’s not convinced

DAVID (CONTD)

Emily this guy isn’t doing all
this because I lost his money If
that were the case why would he
kill the dog guy It doesn’t make
sense

COREY
It’s at least a reason

EMILY
But why here Why not do this in
some alley or wherever where there
isn’t glass separating us or a
security camera watching
David looks around the vestibule Thinks as he speaks

DAVID
It’s isolated Open all night
Only one way in or out And
there’s a box full of money in it
(beat)
It’s the perfect human trap

COREY
Human trap Are you hearing
yourself right now

David shrugs any other ideas

COREY
So what he was waiting here

DAVID
I don’t know It’s possible maybe

EMILY
He couldn’t have followed us We
didn’t see any cars

DAVID

Right yes So he was waiting
COREY

But how did he know we’d be here
DAVID

He didn’t

Corey shakes his head

COREY
Fuck that this is all bullshit

DAVID
(sarcastic)
That’s great man Really fucking

insightful

They all try to calm their nerves a bit

None of them can stop from shivering The cold is
oppressive

After a long beat

COREY
I can’t feel my fingers

EMILY
Me either

Emily extends her pale hands to get a better look at them
Her fingertips are slightly purple

David cups Emily’s hands in his Rubs them

In a much needed moment of levity David grabs Corey’s hands
too Huddles them together with his and Emily’s

But the moment is fleeting Somber looks soon appear on
their faces Their trembling hands lower and separate
Their eyes divert

Theyre freezing to death They clearly know it too

Just then a faint light shines across the parking lot near
the supermarket David Corey and Emily turn to face it

DAVID
What’s that

Seconds later its source appears the same car from earlier
Unlit emergency lights sit on its roof

EMILY
It’s the police The same one from
before

Emily bangs against the class

It’s a security guard

EMILY
So what

The Security car parks Its green lights continue to spin
From out of it emerges the Security Guard

COREY
So he doesn’t have a gun He’s not
going to be able to do shit to stop
that guy
DAVID
(re the Man)
Where is he
COREY
I don’t know I still don’t see
him
Emily bangs on the glass

EMILY
Help us

OUTSIDE THE VESTIBULE
The Security Guard walks toward the vestibule Cautiously

The spinning green light reflects off his shiny brass badge

He notices the residue of the word “HELP” written on the
glass which is now faded and indiscernible

He removes a MAGLITE FLASHLIGHT from his garrison belt next
to a can of PEPPER SPRAY

SECURITY GUARD
What are you guys doing in there

Muffled through the glass
DAVID
Watch out -- there’s someone out
there
Emily opens the door enough to lean outside

The Midwestern wind howls madly

EMILY
Call the police

The Security Guard cannot hear her over the wind

SECURITY GUARD
What I can’t

He walks closer Trepidation in each step

SECURITY GUARD (CONT’D)
Are you okay in there

Still fighting the wind but more discernible

EMILY
(pointing)
He’s trying to kill us

The Security Guard looks over to where Emily points All he
sees is Davids car

Confused at first the Security Guard’s expression quickly
changes upon seeing Robert’s bloody dead body lying on the
concrete

SECURITY GUARD
Jesus

He fumbles with his walkie-talkie Hurriedly puts it to his
mouth

SECURITY GUARD
Twenty-two to base twenty-two to
base

Only STATIC is heard from the other end of the walkie-talkie
SECURITY GUARD (CONT’D)

Twenty-two to base twenty-two to
base

A DISPATCHER is heard through the walkie-talkie

DISPATCHER (VO)
Go ahead twenty-two

WHAM

The Security Guard’s head is smashed with a half crumbled
CINDER BLOCK He collapses to the ground The Man stands over
him

Seeing this Emily YANKS the vestibule door shut

The Security Guard is almost unconscious The man picks up a
smaller piece of the now shattered cinder block and SMASH-
SMASH The man slams him in the temple Blood spills out

Just as suddenly as it started it stops The Security Guard
doesn’t move

The Man takes a step away over to the Security car He
turns off the ignition the lights

The Man then grabs the Security Guard by his shirt Drags
him using only one of his powerful arms across the parking
lot Like he’s clearing roadkill

INSIDE THE VESTIBULE

David Emily and Corey watch as the Man drags the Security
Guard’s dead bloodied body closer to David’s car He leaves
him there carelessly not far from Robert’s carcass

It’s all too much for Emily to take

She walks softly to the corner of the booth Sits down Her
back facing David and Corey

After a beat

DAVID
Are you okay Emily

She doesn’t answer

COREY
Emily

EMILY
Leave me alone

David reaches out to touch Emily’s shoulder She abruptly
pulls away

EMILY
Both of you please justleave
me alone

She shivers in the cold Hugs her arms close to her body
David and Corey speak quietly to each other

COREY
She needs to keep moving

DAVID
I know I know

COREY
We should still make a run for it --

DAVID
(overlapping)
No --

COREY
-- He’ll go for one of us and the
others can make a run for it

DAVID
Who’s going to play the bait You
Because I’m sure as hell not going
to again

Corey sighs Frustrated
Still huddled in the corner

EMILY
Do we have any more plants

DAVID
(confused
What

EMILY
PlantsI don’t know I thought
there were plants

She rubs her temples Appears disconcerted

COREY
(quietly to David)
She’s disoriented as fuck

DAVID
It’s hypothermia We can’t stay
here much longer

COREY
No shit We just have --

CLICK A HOWLING wind blows into the vestibule

Their heads WHIP around to face the now open door where they
see --

-- THE MAN WALKING IN
Corey’s eyes widen

DAVID
Emily

David LUNGES forward BLOCKING the Man from Emily who he is
nearest He GRABS the Man by his thick jacket and SLAMS him
against the plaster wall

MAN
Ahhh

The Man FIGHTS BACK Resists Corey immediately JUMPS in
the fray Joins David in WRESTLING the Man to the ground

WHACK-WHACK-WHACK David and Corey’s PUNCHES land
haphazardly all over the Man’s face and body Still he
continues to struggle both audibly and physically

The Man KICKS wildly STRIKING Corey in the face
Emily screams

DAVID
Grab him

Corey shakes it off Blood spills from his nose He JUMPS
back on top of the Man rejoining David in the struggle He
GRABS the Man by the hair lifts his head --

-- SLAM-SLAM-SLAM Against the wall just beneath the
signing shelf The Man screams out in pain Blood stains
his hair Still he fights back Grabs at David’s face and
neck

EMILY
David
The Man’s fingers RAKE across David’s eyes PULL at his hair
and skin The entire battle is awkwardly primordial No

skill whatsoever only pure survival instinct

With the Man’s hands now GRABBING at his throat David

notices the pen -- hanging from a thin steel cable wire
attached to the signing shelf above -- dangling in front of
him

His eyes widen

He frees one of his hands which is tangled up in the
struggle Grabs the pen Wraps the steel wire around the
Man’s throat Takes hold of the wire with both hands --

-- and PULLS with all his might Pushing off with his feet
for leverage against the Man’s body

The Man’s hands instantly raise to his throat He writhes
and thrashes like a fish on a boat deck Desperately tries
to squeeze his fingers beneath the wire

His face turns color Red first then blue The veins in
his forehead and neck look as if they are about to burst

David bares his clenched teeth holding on with all his
strength

The Man’s legs kick uncontrollably more and moreuntil --

-- he succumbs to asphyxiation He stops moving His head
slowly slumps to his chest

It’s over
Corey inches away from the body Equally unnerved David
pushes the Man’s dead bloodied body off of him onto the

floor

INSERT - The POV from the black and white security camera
in the ATM

David slides out from underneath the Man Lets go of the
signing shelf pen cord wrapped around the Man’s throat It
slips off the Man Dangles from the signing shelf

Corey and Emily stare David looks up at them

BACK TO SCENE

EMILY
Is he

Still laboring to catch his breath David responds with an
uneasy nod

Corey lets out a long sigh His lungs are also on fire from
the encounter He takes off his collared dress shirt
leaving him in a T-shirt He holds the collared shirt to his
bloody nose

EMILY (CONT’D)
Whatwhat do we do now

COREY
Leave

David nods in agreement still somewhat shell-shocked

EMILY
We have to tell the police

DAVID
Yeah We will Let’s just get out
of here first

David climbs to his feet Corey does the same

DAVID (CONTD)
(to Emily)
You okay

EMILY
Yeah Are you

DAVID
I think so
(to Corey)
How’s your nose

Corey doesn’t answer He slowly lowers the shirt from his
nose His dilated eyes stare straight ahead

DAVID (CONTD)
(to Corey)
Hey You all right

EMILY
No

David looks at Emily She also stares outside David turns
to see what they’re looking at

To his shock he sees the Man Standing twenty feet from the
entrance Watching them

DAVID
What How’s he

EMILY
What did you do

DAVID
I didn’t do anything Hehe was
going to kill us

COREY
(re the dead body)
Who is he If it’s not him then
who is it

DAVID
I don’t know I thoughtyou did
too

COREY

I know I know

David is thunderstruck He places his hand against the wall
to steady himself

Emily takes steps away overcome by emotion

After a beat Corey takes off the dead man’s parka Its hood
-- which was on the dead man’s head when he first entered the
vestibule -- has since fallen off exposing his bloody face

Underneath the parka the dead man wears a work uniform of
some kind A factory-style jumpsuit A plastic employee
badge for “NEWGATE HOSPITAL” -- with his photo name and
“CUSTODIAL DEPT - 3RD SHIFT” printed on it -- is clipped to
his breast pocket

Corey searches through the parka pockets He only finds
useless pieces of paper He then starts a search of the dead
man’s pants pockets

DAVID
What are you doing

COREY
Looking for a cell phone

Corey continues his frantic search From the dead man’s
pockets he removes

Set of keys

Small bits of paper
And a wallet
But no cell phone

COREY (CONTD)
Nothing

Corey resignedly tosses the items to the cold tile floor
Emily notices an ATM card lying on the floor

David grabs the dead man’s discarded wallet off the floor
Sifts through its contents

A credit card
Very little cash

A small photo of him along with a woman of about the same
age and two adolescent children

His license

DAVID
(reading)
Harold Westbrook Eight Frederick
Street Date of birth five
nineteen sixty-eight
(beat)
What the hell was he doing here

EMILY
Using the ATM

David looks over to see Emily holding Harold’s ATM card

David leans back against the frosty glass Sits down His
head falls into his trembling hands

COREY
We don’t know anything about this
guy For all we know he could’ve
been working with that douchebag
outside

DAVID
He’s got a wifekids

COREY
So what That could all be
bullshit

DAVID
For Christ’s sake Corey the guy’s
a fucking janitor He was on his
way to work

Emily places the ATM card on the floor and moves back
EMILY
He’s innocent
(sotto but loud enough
for them to hear)
Just like we are

Corey and David are quickly sobered by this statement A few
moments of silence pass before David breaks it

DAVID
(re Harold dejected)
Not anymore
David looks at Emily His guilt is palpable

Corey can’t fight it anymore He knows they’re right

He kicks over the metal waste basket Paper flies
everywhere

OUTSIDE THE VESTIBULE

The Man watches them for a moment Studies them

After a beat he moves into the shadows

INSIDE THE VESTIBULE

Emily returns to the opposite side of the vestibule David
remains seated against the glass his arms huddled to his
chest Corey walks over to Harold’s body and takes the parka
off him

Seeing Harold’s bloody dead body makes Emily uneasy She
looks away

Corey puts the heavy parka on over his T-shirt Walks to the
other end of the vestibule lLeans against the glass

It’s apparent they all need some space from one another
No one says a word at first And then after a long beat
DAVID

You had to make me stop You
couldn’t just go home

COREY
Fuck you David Don’t even try
make this my fault

DAVID
It is your fault

OUTSIDE THE VESTIBULE
The Man walks to the rear of the vestibule

David and Corey continue to argue OFF-SCREEN Their voices
though slightly silenced by the walls still carry through
enough to be heard

COREY (0S)
Nobody made you stop

DAVID (0S)
You did

The Man flips open the toolbox Grabs the spool of metal
wire

INSIDE THE VESTIBULE
The argument continues

COREY
I didn’t make you do anything You
could’ve said no

DAVID
I did say no Twice But as
usual you didn’t give a shit

COREY
That still doesn’t make this my
fault If it’s anyone’s fault
it’s yours

DAVID
Mine

David leaps to his feet

COREY
Get the fuck out of my face

DAVID
Fuck you

COREY
(re Harold )
You’re the one who did this
With that David immediately charges at Corey

INSERT - The POV from the silent black and white camera
inside the ATM

David slams Corey hard into the plaster wall Corey stands
back momentarily shocked He appears to shout something and
then charges back at David

BACK TO SCENE

Corey tries to tackle David but David holds his ground
Emily attempts to break it up

EMILY
Stop Stop it

David pushes Corey back against the wall Corey responds by
SHOVING David hard to his chest

DAVID
(to Corey)
You did it too

COREY
Get off me

OUTSIDE THE VESTIBULE

The Man watches from the shadows not far from David’s car
Corey and David continue to push and shove each other
INSIDE THE VESTIBULE

David and Corey still tangled up have clearly begun to
tire

Their arms soon unlock Release their grip on each other
breaking the stalemate

They each let out long sighs which curl from their mouths in
spirals of cold mist

They walk away from each other
Emily looks outside

EMILY
He’s gone again
David doesn’t bother to look Neither does Corey
disdainful gazes are locked on each other

DAVID
He’s out there Somewhere

It’s clear that Corey’s reached a breaking point

COREY
I’m tired of this shit I’m tired
of hiding Tired of waiting for
someone to come save me

DAVID
It’s the only option we have

COREY
You have

Corey grabs his bottle of tequila Takes a swig

EMILY
What are you going to do

COREY
Get the hell out of here

DAVID
That’s what he wants you to do --

COREY
-- Fuck him He’s one guy There
are three of us

EMILY
I can’t go out there Corey

COREY

Dont

(to David)
You either

(to both)
I don’t even care anymore If you
want to stay in here and die
that’s your call But I’m done
with this

Corey places his bottle of Tequila on the ground

EMILY
Please just wait

COREY
No No more waiting

Their

DAVID
Enough with the tough guy rou --
Waitwhat Corey’s BURSTS out of the vestibule door

DAVID (CONT’D)
Corey no

OUTSIDE THE VESTIBULE
Corey stops for a brief moment not far from the door Scans
the parking lot To the leftto the right It’s empty --

the Man is nowhere to be found

David and Emily bang against the glass trying to get Corey
to return

Corey disregards their pleas

He steels himself -- and then RACES into the darkened lot

His legs pump hard despite being nearly locked up from the
cold His heart drums wildly

Just as he is about to pass by Davids car --

-- WHAM His legs inexplicably come out from under him
landing him flat on his back Hard The bone in his left
leg BREAKS

INSIDE THE VESTIBULE

David and Emily watch Panicked

DAVID
No

EMILY
Corey

OUTSIDE THE VESTIBULE

Corey lies on the ground in agonizing pain He coughs
gasps for breath Holds his throat

Still he tries to drag himself to safety

Just then the Man approaches him arriving from out of the
darkness Traces something in the air -- a straight line of
some kind

WE SEE what it is he traces the metal wire -- strung across
the clearing between the car and the pole of an overhead
light

He created a perimeter

The Man hovers over Corey Corey’s gaze climbs him until he
finally stares at the Man’s shrouded face Deep cloudy
breaths emanate from underneath his hood

COREY
Pleaseplease

INSIDE THE VESTIBULE
David bangs against the glass Pleads for his friend’s life

DAVID
No Not

The Man looks over at David and Emily He calmly pulls out a
SCREWDRIVER from inside his parka

David’s eyes widen as he sees the screwdriver He tries to
exit the vestibule to help his friend but Emily grabs hold
of him She hangs on with all her might

DAVID (CONT’D)
No Corey

EMILY
David no

DAVID
Let me go

EMILY
It’s too late

DAVID
No it’s not Let me go

David opens the door and pushes free of Emily Harder than
he probably intended She falls backward tripping over
Harold’s legs and SLAMMING her head onto the cold floor

Seeing this David stops Closes the door and rushes to her
side

DAVID (CONTD)
Shit I’m sorry Emily

EMILY
I’m okay I’m all right

She rubs the back of her head

Seeing that she’s okay David starts to turn away Emily
grabs him by the arm with surprising force stopping him

EMILY (CONT’D)
Don’t look

Emily’s fearful pleas give David pause
But David has to look

He slowly turns to face the vestibule door Outside he sees
Corey’s dead bloody body lying on the cold concrete The
screwdriver still sticking from his stomach

Davids hands tremble His breathing borders on
hyperventilation

Nearing a breakdown David’s feet move backwards Slowly
Further and further away from the door

His back soon touches the plaster wall Collapses onto it

DAVID
This can’tthis can’t be
happening

He rubs at his eyes his temples His hands wring his mussed
hair His whole body shakes

He falls apart

Emily waits a moment before approaching him Sits down next
to him She holds him he holds her They shiver in the
unyielding cold

OUTSIDE THE VESTIBULE

The Man walks behind the vestibule Picks up the hammer and
screwdriver He’s just about to SMASH the metal door when
he’s distracted by a distant sound

Turning to see what caused it he notices that yet another
Christmas tree has blown over near the supermarket It pulls
against a metal chain which keeps it from completely blowing
away

He is about to return his attention to the vestibule but
does a double-take when he sees --

-- the long frozen industrial hose snaked between the rows
of Christmas trees

He takes a beat The vapor of misty breath stops coming from
under his parka hood The world seems still quiet As if
providing him with the silence he needs to think

Then a sudden release of breath escapes his mouth as he
marches over to the row of Christmas trees

He grabs the industrial hose Pulls It cracks and creaks
as the ice inside and around it breaks up

FADE TO
INSIDE THE VESTIBULE

David and Emily huddle close together for warmth It does
little to keep their bodies from freezing

DAVID
The hatI knew it wasn’t yours
I grabbed it off the back of
someone’s chair

EMILY
Why

DAVID
(shrugs)
I was desperate

EMILY
For what

DAVID
For a way to keep you from leaving
(beat)
I wish I had just let you go I’m
so sorry

EMILY
Don’t be

DAVID
You should be home right now

EMILY
David

DAVID
It’s my fault

An unsettling realization occurs to Emily

EMILY
Youre right It is

David looks at Emily Surprised by her concurrence

EMILY (CONT’D)
It’s all of our fault

Emily sets adrift in thought

EMILY (CONT’‘D)

Weve been in here for hours now
trying to control what’s happening
to us Waiting fora reason

(beat)
What because we didn’t do anything
wrong we’re somehow supposed to be
protected By who The police
Alarms Little visor clips with
angels on them

(beat)
If there is a reason this is
happening it’s because we never
thought it could

David takes a moment to consider this

DAVID
Still you shouldn’t be here

EMILY
I could have taken a cab I could
have skipped the party I could
have never worked at Starkweather
in the first place But I did all
those things and a million random
things in between and added up
they all brought me here
tonightwith you

David looks up at Emily

EMILY (CONT’‘D)
Although given what’s happened
lunch would have probably been a
better choice

David ekes out a smile He pulls Emily closer They tighten
their embrace

DAVID
I’ve wanted to be this close to you
for so long

Emily’s head falls to David’s chest against his T-shirt
Her chin slowly rises

Tears trickle over her lips as they draw nearer to Davids
And then suddenly --
BANG

David and Emily LEAP to their feet Turn to face the plaster
wall

BANG-BANG-BANG-BANG
Followed by silence

David and Emily stare at the plaster wall Like deer in
headlights Waiting for whatever could possibly happen next

And then the distinct sound of old rusted hinges squealing
as a hulking metal door is forced open

David and Emily listen intently

The Man’s heavy footsteps trace along the opposite side of
the plaster wall

A faint clinking sound is heard coming from the heating
vent Metal touching metal But just as suddenly as it
started it stops

Silence Emily and David don’t move a muscle They wait

David’s attention is suddenly stolen by something he sees out
of the corner of his eye

David turns around fully to get a better look

His visage of bewilderment is instantly replaced by that of
shock

DAVID
Christ

Emily turns to see what David is looking at

It’s Corey He’s ash-white Bleeding profusely The
screwdriver still stuck in his stomach

Coreys quivering arms drag himself across the parking lot
toward the ATM vestibule A trail of smeared blood follows
him

Emily is about to say something -- or scream -- when David
pulls her close to him Covers her mouth

Puts a finger to his mouth Shhhhhhhh A cloud of smoke
accentuates his silent directive

He points at the plaster wall referring to the Man Emily
gets it -- she nods

David removes his hand from her mouth

David quietly opens the vestibule door Exits Emily exits
with him to

OUTSIDE THE VESTIBULE
They are instantly hit with an achingly cold gust of wind
In the background WE SEE the time and temperature sign
Current time 3léam Temperature negative 6 degrees
Fahrenheit
David and Emily sneak across the parking lot Hurry over to
Corey Grab him under the arms Lift the upper part of his
body off the ground
For a moment they consider whether to make a run for it in
the other direction But it’s impossible They have to get
Corey back inside
DAVID
(hushed)

Okay Come on

They move Corey back toward the vestibule trying not to make
a sound His rag doll legs noisily drag across the ground

DAVID (CONTD)
(hushed)
Hurry

They continue to drag Corey Blood spills from his open
wound They’re halfway there when --

THE MAN

appears from out of the shadows He moves toward them
Faster than usual

DAVID AND EMILY
see the Man They panic

EMILY
There he is

DAVID
Go-go-go

They pull with all their might as fast as their frozen
fatigued bodies will allow

THE MAN

closes the distance between them He holds the tire iron in
his hand

DAVID AND EMILY

pull Corey with all their collective might David’s legs get
tangled with Corey’s He stumbles

EMILY
Get up He’s coming

David quickly gets back to his feet They resume their
rescue effort

THE MAN

gets dangerously close Within twenty feet Fifteen feet
Ten feet

DAVID AND EMILY
call upon every last bit of strength they possess
DAVID

Get the door I’ve got him -- get

the door
EMILY
lets go of Corey Rushes over to the vestibule
DAVID
grabs Corey under both arms from behind Lifts hima bit
higher off the ground than he previously had been Corey
lets out a pained groan

THE MAN

sees Emily rushing for the vestibule He chooses to stay on
David He’s close Very close

EMILY

opens the door Rushes inside Holds the door open with an
outstretched arm

THE MAN

raises the tire iron as he gets within striking distance of
David

EMILY
David Hurry

DAVID
gives Corey one final desperate pull dragging him
INSIDE THE VESTIBULE

Emily helps pull David in as he still carries Corey Emily
SLAMS the door shut

INSERT - The POV from the black and white security camera
in the ATM

David falls into the vestibule on top of Corey after
dragging his body in there

David drags and leans Corey against one of the windows
David’s body blocks much of what is going on with Corey

BACK TO SCENE
OUTSIDE THE VESTIBULE

The Man stands outside the vestibule Just over ten feet
away from the entrance Still holding the tire iron

He stares at Emily who remains standing at the door
Transfixed After a beat the Man lowers the tire iron to
his side
INSIDE THE VESTIBULE
Emily stares back at the Man Terrified
DAVID

Emily what are you doing I need

your help
Emily snaps out of it Slowly Still staring at the Man
After a beat she joins David who attends to Corey
Corey’s in worse condition than it seemed

His skin is terribly pale

His purple lips tremble

Blood leaks from his stomach through his flimsy T-shirt and
all over Harold’s parka which he still wears

DAVID
(to Corey)
Holy shit holy shit Corey
Corey Can you hear me Come on
buddypleaseCorey Corey
(to Emily)
Weve got to get him help

EMILY
Cover his stomach with something

DAVID
With what

EMILY
Anything

DAVID
I don’t have -- give me something

Emily looks around Grabs a handful of deposit envelopes
Hands them to David

EMILY
(re the envelopes)
Use these

David places them against Corey’s wound carefully avoiding
the screwdriver Blood immediately soaks through the paper

The pressure causes Corey to emit an anguished scream He
doubles over

OUTSIDE THE VESTIBULE

The Man leans in the smashed passenger side window of Davids
car Shifts it into NEUTRAL

INSIDE THE VESTIBULE
Corey’s condition worsens by the second

DAVID
What do I do

EMILY
I don’t know

Corey shivers uncontrollably He’s freezing Bleeding to
death

DAVID
JesusCorey

To Emily regarding the screwdriver

DAVID (CONTD)
Should I pull it out

EMILY
No It could make it worse

DAVID
(re the blood)
It’s not stopping

EMILY
I know I know
Emily places Corey’s discarded button-down shirt -- which he
previously left in the vestibule after using it to blot his
bloody nose -- over his stomach
DAVID

Do it easy

EMILY
I have to put pressure on it

Emily presses the shirt down on Corey’s wound trying to
stabilize his bleeding More blood oozes out Corey
responds weakly It’s clear he’s fading fast

The blood soaks through the shirt drenching it

DAVID
Weve got to get him to a hospital

EMILY
How

DAVID
I don’t know but we have to He’s
going to bleed to death if we
don’t

Corey continues to shiver

Emily takes off her coat leaving her in her work blouse
She drapes it over Corey like a blanket

Still aiding Corey David looks outside for the Man He’s
nowhere in sight

David turns his attention back inside the vestibule
Frantically looks everywhere for an answer

DAVID (CONTD)
If we try to

David notices that Corey is starting to drift away He
gently taps his cheek to bring him back

DAVID (CONTD)
(to Corey)
-whoa-whoa-whoa CoreyCorey
Corey comes back around albeit slightly
DAVID (CONTD)
(re the compress)
Keep holding that there

David climbs to his feet Nervously searches the vestibule

EMILY
What are you doing

David picks up the metal waste basket Takes firm hold of
it

Without even a moment of hesitation --

WHACK WHACK WHACK David slams the waste basket against
the ATM

INSERT - POV from the black and white security camera in
the ATM

The round base of the metal waste basket comes into frame as
it’s continuously SMASHED against the ATM

After yet another SMASH with the waste basket the image on
ATM security camera goes dead

BACK TO SCENE

The ATM display screen is shattered There is no longer an
image -- only a dead broken monitor

David looks up to the emergency lights with hope in his
expectant eyes

Still no alarm

EMILY
What are you doing

DAVID
It’ll send a signal to the police
won’t it If the ATM’s broken

EMILY
I don’t know

DAVID
Well something in this thing has
to It’s owned by a God damn bank

Still tending to the rapidly fading Corey Emily glances
outside Her mouth falls agape

David turns and sees why

The Man has rolled David’s car up against the front of the
vestibule The front bumper presses against the glass door

DAVID (CONTD)
What

David tries to open the vestibule door Not a chance He
frantically tries again It barely opens an inch

DAVID (CONTD)
We’re locked in

Corey suddenly starts to convulse
EMILY
(re Corey)
What’s he doing

David rushes over to help Grabs Corey’s shaking legs

DAVID
Grab him

Emily struggles to Keep Corey’s body under control Blood
and bile spill from the corner of his mouth

DAVID (CONTD)
Corey Come on buddy Please

Corey soon stops He’s alive Barely His blood soaks
Davids clothes

David is paralyzed by his inability to do a damn thing to fix
the situation

And then -- THERE’S WATER

It rushes through the heating vent Fast

DAVID (CONTD)
Holy shit

The icy water rapidly spreads across the floor Pools in the
corners

EMILY
Stop it

David stuffs Corey’s discarded bloody shirt into the metal
grate covering the vent It does little to stop the heavy
flow of water

He winces in pain as the cold water stings his shivering
purple hands The water splashes all over him soaking his
clothes

An inch of water has already filled the vestibule Some

leaks out from underneath the door and windows -- but not
much

EMILY (CONTD)
David help me

Emily tries to lift Corey’s body from the water

David rushes over to help They lift Corey’s body He emits
a pained moan

DAVID
The signing shelf

Their feet splash through the frigid water as they struggle
to carry Cory’s limp body over to the signing shelf

DAVID (CONTD)
On three One two three

They try to lift Corey high enough to lay him on the signing
shelf but can’t

DAVID (CONTD)
Higher

EMILY
IIcan’t

Emily’s bent fingers appear almost arthritic The cold and
wet is crippling She shivers uncontrollably

David grabs Corey by himself Lifts him Places him on the
shelf -- but it’s far too narrow Corey slips right off

David has no choice but to place him back on the ground in
the water It’s now close to six inches deep

DAVID
Fuck

Emily drapes her coat over Corey once again David
approaches the door

He tries to control his erratic irrepressibly rapid
breathing His purple lips quiver

EMILY
(re the Man)
He’s trying to drown us

David pushes the door with all his might

It opens an inch Water drains -- but cold air rushes in
Davids muscles give The door closes

DAVID
Not drown us -- freeze us

The water is unremitting Gallon after ice cold gallon
spills from out of the vent bringing the level in the
vestibule just under David and Emily’s knees

Harold’s corpse floats at the surface of the frigid water
Holding Corey close compressing his wound David’s eyes
frenetically dart in every direction searching for a
solution

And then he sees something -- right in front of his face
The focus of his rapt attention a pack of cigarettes poking
out of the inside pocket of Harold’s parka -- which is still
being worn by Corey

David ferrets through the parka Removes the pack of
cigarettes As he clearly hoped a disposable lighter is

also tucked away in the inside pocket

His look of hopelessness evaporates from his face overcome
by an expression of nascent optimism

He then looks up at the ceiling where he sees --

-- the FIRE SPRINKLER system poking through various parts of
the high ceiling

David hatches an instant plan Potentially a good one

He leaps to his feet Climbs with great difficulty on top

of the metal signing shelf Tries sparking the lighter His

numb purple hands lack the motor skills required to spin the
striker

He resolves to use the palm of his other hand to spin it

It only spits a few sparks

One more try Finally it catches He holds the lighter
over his head But the ceiling is far too high

DAVID (CONTD)
Shit

EMILY
You need to be higher

DAVID
I know I know

Emily sits Corey up against the wall She then collects as
Many paper items as she can that have not yet gotten wet
Deposit envelopes discarded receipts etc

Stuffs them in the metal waste basket which now floats on
the surface of the rising water

EMILY

Find as much paper as you can

Anything that will burn
David joins Emily as they both work intensively at this task
OUTSIDE THE VESTIBULE
The Man sets up the folding lawn chair Sits in it Watches
David and Emily from afar as they race to fill the waste
basket
INSIDE THE VESTIBULE
The waste basket is fairly full

DAVID
That’s enough

David holds out the lighter Again he struggles to light it
Spark Spark
DAVID

(sotto)
Come on come on

Spark Spark

DAVID (CONTD)
Come on

And then finally --

-- and it catches He uses his other hand to shield the
flame as he moves the lighter closer to the paper in the
waste basket

David touches the flame to the corner of a single piece of
paper The flames quickly spread He stuffs the lighter
into his pants pocket

Within a matter of seconds large flames jump out from the
top of the waste basket

DAVID (CONTD)
All right -- hold onto it

Emily takes hold of the waste basket Watches David as the
ice cold water continues to rise

He places his knee on top of the signing shelf Reaches to
grab hold of anything that can assist him in his climb -- but
there’s nothing Just a blank glass wall

Inching forward onto his butt he manages to sit on the
narrow shelf The next step is far more difficult standing

up

He checks the status of the fire inside the waste basket
Still burning but already showing signs of weakening He
looks over at Corey who sits against the wall The water is
up to his chest

Time is running out -- for everyone

DAVID (CONTD)
Throw in more paper

EMILY
There’s only a little left

DAVID
Use it

Emily throws in the last of the paper The fire reignites to
its original strength

She approaches the signing shelf

EMILY
Here -- grab onto my shoulders

David does just that He’s able to maintain his balance long
enough to stand up

DAVID
Okayhand it to me

Ducking away from the flames Emily lifts up the metal waste
basket

DAVID (CONTD)
Carefulbe careful

EMILY
Take ittake it

David takes the waste basket

Emily takes several steps backward Sloshes through the ice
cold water

David lifts the waste basket Past his face Over his head

His lower back inches away from the wall He sways back and
forth

His view of the fire sprinkler is blocked by the waste
basket

DAVID
Am I near it

She shakes her head to offer a distressed “No”
David angles the waste basket so he can see for himself
He’s not even close The ceiling is simply too high

He lets out a frustrated scream Lowers the waste basket
Rests it on the signing shelf

OUTSIDE THE VESTIBULE
David’s scream is dampened by the glass windows
The Man remains seated in the lawn chair Patiently waiting

He watches as Emily pushes against the door It opens enough
to let some water out

INSIDE THE VESTIBULE

The fire inside the waste basket is dying fast

DAVID
We need more paper Anything

Corey fades in and out of consciousness His skin has turned
an icy blue

The water level is up to his chin Emily’s jacket which was
previously draped over him like a blanket now floats on top
of the water as does his capped bottle of tequila

Emily tears cardboard Bank of the Midwest advertisements out
from behind their plastic shields on the plaster wall
Hurries them over to David

EMILY
Throw these in

David does just that

WOOSH -- the advertisements go up in flames David angles
away from the heat But the flames quickly subside
Threaten to extinguish

Emily and Davids already raised panic increases

EMILY (CONT’D)
Help me up

Emily starts climbing onto the signing table She extends
her hand for David to grab

EMILY (CONT’D)
Help pull me up

DAVID
No -- what are you doing

EMILY
The fire’s going to burn out

David helps Emily onto the narrow signing shelf The two of
them barely fit on top of it The flaming waste basket
doesn’t make it any easier

Emily takes hold of David’s shoulder as she gets her balance
Being smaller than David she has less trouble standing up

DAVID
What the hell are you --

EMILY
Try to squat down a little

DAVID
The fire’s going out We’re
wasting time

EMILY
If I can get on your shoulders I
should be able to get close enough
to the sprinklers

DAVID
What

EMILY
Just do it David Please

David squats down Slightly His back eases away from the
wall His balance is shaky

Emily places her foot on David’s thigh Carefully grabs
around his neck Tries to climb on top of him

With one hand still balancing the waste basket on the signing
table David uses the other to help Emily climb

Emily’s foot slips off David’s thigh She loses her balance
but manages to stay on the signing shelf

Corey emits a pained moan which instantly turns into a misty
spiral in the cold air

DAVID
Forget it

David grabs the other side of the waste basket Ready to
lift it again

EMILY
Help me up again

DAVID
Forget it Emily It’s not
working

EMILY

You can’t reach it by yourself

David reluctantly gives in He squats lower struggling to
maintain his balance

EMILY (CONT’D)
Lower

DAVID
I can’t get any lower without
falling off

EMILY
Try

He manages to lower himself a few more inches His legs sway
back and forth threatening to cause him to fall at any
moment

Emily again places her foot on David’s thigh

Grabs hold around his neck

Pulls herself up

Slowly raises her leg over his shoulder followed by the
other

She’s on

David wavers a bit causing Emily to sway but he manages to
hold fast He slowly presses up with his legs

They did it And not a minute too soon -- the fire is
rapidly fading

EMILY
Okay pass it to me

David grips the waste basket

His knees shake a bit His balance remains unsteady He
raises the flaming waste basket

DAVID
Okay take it

The flames get rather close to Emily Still she reaches for
the waste basket

EMILY
Almost

David extends his arms above his head as far as he can
Emily’s hands lunge for the basket She reaches further
Further

And then finally --

EMILY (CONTD)
I’ve got it
David slowly releases the waste basket Emily holds onto it
DAVID
All right rise it above you
Under one of the sprinklers

Emily spots the closest sprinkler It’s right above her

The top of David’s feet dangle precariously off the edge of
the shelf His hypothermic body sways back and forth

Emily’s skinny soaking wet arms struggle to raise the metal
waste basket over her head

DAVID (CONTD)
Higher

EMILY
I’m trying

It inches up further Almost close enough

Higher

Higher

Almost there

And then as the flames lick against the sprinkler --

-- PSSSHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH All of the sprinklers fire
raining down water inside the vestibule

OUTSIDE THE VESTIBULE

The Man watches from the shadows as a STROBE LIGHT flashes
repeatedly from inside the vestibule A separate strobe
light flashes outside the vestibule

An audible ALARM sounds WOOPWOOPWOOPWOOP
INSIDE THE VESTIBULE

Frigid water sprays all over Emily and David The strobe
light flashes ad nauseam The alarm is deafening

But Emily and David rejoice

EMILY
It worked It wor --

The signing shelf gives on one side Collapses

David’s legs come right out from under him He and Emily
come CRASHING down

David SPLASHES into the waist-deep water that fills the
vestibule His back SLAMS against the floor below with a
thud

Emily falling from an even greater height falls straight
down --

-- SMACK Her head SMASHES against the half of the signing
shelf that did not collapse She SPLASHES into the water

Clouds of crimson spill from her head clouding the water in
which she now floats

In a great deal of pain hypothermic David emerges from the
water Sees Emily lying motionless in the sanguine water

DAVID
Emily

He rushes through the water to her Lifts her in his arms
Holds her close to him Shivers uncontrollably

DAVID (CONTD)
(frantic)
Oh my God Emily

She barely stirs Her eyes flutter Bloody spit spills from
the corner of her mouth

She’s alive Hanging on by a thread

Gelid water also continues to rain down from the sprinkler
causing the water level to rise twice as fast as before

The strobe light keeps its cadence as does the audible alarm
sound

DAVID (CONTD)
Pleasejust hold on Help’s on
the way Hold on

Emily’s almost completely unresponsive She starts to slip
away

DAVID (CONTD)
No-no-nocome back come back

Emily comes around albeit ever so slightly But only for a
moment She and David look in each other’s eyesand
then

she’s gone

Crestfallen David leans his head against the glass wall
hugging Emily close to him He shivers madly colder than
ever

DAVID
No

The ear-piercing sound of the alarm and the extremely bright
strobe light are maddening

Holding Emily in his trembling arms covered in her blood he
rapidly comes undone

He looks across the vestibule at Corey who like Harold
floats face-down on the surface of the water

Time has expired for him as well

David falls apart The water from the sprinklers rains down
on his defeated head

It’s over

But then --

David’s car CRASHES through the vestibule door after having
been RAMMED by the Security Car

The vestibule’s glass walls SHATTER

Water RUSHES from the vestibule into the parking lot
bringing Corey’s body with it

David lays on the floor of what remains of the vestibule
Injured Disoriented Bleeding Freezing

He soon regains his faculties Looks at the piled-up cars
The destruction The bodies

He crawls over to where Emily’s body now lay Cradles her in
his tremulous arms

A single tear streaks down his pallid cheek It clings to
his clenched jaw before falling to the ground

He looks outside the vestibule at the Man who is back in
view seated -- to David’s confusion -- in the folding lawn
chair

The Man doesn’t flinch He just sits and watches

But then -- a change in David begins to occur Angry tears
escape his eyes His teeth clench His pulse races His
breathing becomes fast and guttural

Overcome by a blinding rage he leans Emily’s lifeless body
against the wall Sits her upright against the badly
damaged plaster wall

He tenderly brushes her hair from her pretty face as the
achingly cold water continues to spray from the fire
sprinklers above

Despite the extensive damage suffered by the vestibule the
emergency lights continue to strobe interspersing flashes of
white light with moments of almost complete darkness

The fire alarm keeps its maddening cadence

David climbs to his feet Walks like a caged animal across
the vestibule His eyes lock on Corey’s half-full bottle of
tequila

He unscrews the cap

Reaches into his car through the smashed window Removes his
jacket Tears out the liner

Pours a small amount of the tequila onto the jacket liner

Stuffs it into the bottle letting a portion hang outside to
serve as a wick

A Molotov Cocktail

David then exits what’s left of the vestibule Walks past
the crashed security car Sees that the gas peddle is wedged
to the floor with the tire iron

He approaches Corey’s drenched dead body

He grabs hold of the screwdriver in Corey’s stomach looks
away -- and YANKS it out

Seething David again looks out at the Man who still remains
seated in the folding chair partially shrouded by darkness

David takes one last look at Emily She leans against the
plaster wall where he left her

Tragically beautiful
This galvanizing image brings David to his breaking point

The temperature is crippling His drenched clothes cling to
his enfeebled frame Still David soldiers on

He holds the Molotov Cocktail at the ready The screwdriver
in the other hand

He removes the lighter from his pocket It lights on the
first try He touches the flame to the alcohol-soaked jacket
liner

It catches

Covered in blood and with a look of unbridled hostility on
his face David looks every bit the animal his captivity has
caused him to become

The alarm sounds loudly

The strobe light continues to flash outside and inside the
vestibule

The green security lights spin atop the security car as steam
emanates from under its damaged hood

The night’s madness has reached its crescendo

David moves in closer the screwdriver outstretched before
him Every step he takes gathers more purpose

Incredibly the Man still does not move from the chair He
sits hidden in the shadows watching as David draws nearer

David is now approaching with considerable speed Without
breaking his stride he takes a quick look at the Molotov
Cocktail It’s more than ready

DAVID
(reaching his arm back)
Burn you son of a bitch

With that David throws the bottle down hard from less than
ten feet away

-- BOOOOSH It crashes directly in front of the Man
instantly engulfing him in flames

A somewhat sadistic satisfied smile grin crosses Davids
face

DAVID (CONTD)
BURN

But then his savage elation slowly fades away replaced by a
look of grave concern

To Davids amazement -- and horror -- the Man doesnt move an
inch despite being burned alive The flames burn high into
the dark sky but the Man sits motionless

His primal courage quashed David’s overcome by the crushing
return of his fear He clearly can’t believe what he’s
witnessing

He moves in closer to investigate Cautiously Shields his
face from the heat with his hand

And then once he’s within a few feet of the Man something
stops David in his tracks Through the flames he sees --

-- a badge And a garrison belt It’s not the Man it’s the
Security Guard He’s been placed in the chair

David WHIPS his head to where the Security Guard last was
He’s not there An empty pool of blood on the concrete marks
his absence

Realizing he’s been tricked David SPINS around

A look of abject terror appears on his face

WE SEE why The Man stands outside the vestibule staring at
David blocking any chance of escape in that direction

With little hesitation he walks toward David

Upon turning to face the other direction David sees he
finally has a chance to make a run for it

INSERT - The Security Guard’s garrison belt Covered in
fire the can of pepper spray deforms from the blistering
heat

BACK TO SCENE

Just as David takes his first step in that direction
preparing to dash to safety --

-- POP The pressurized can of pepper spray BURSTS
A mist BLASTS out from the Security Guard covering David

like a swarm of bees He falls his knees clutching at his
burning eyes in agony Screaming Writhing

The Man halts his stride and watches David Unflinchingly

David tries desperately to see but cannot He falls to his
knees at the foot of the burning Security Guard The
screwdriver still in his hand

Suddenly sirens are heard getting louder by the second
The faint hue of flashing red and blue lights appear

Within seconds several POLICE CARS come SCREAMING into the
distant entrance of the parking lot followed by a FIRE
TRUCK

INT POLICE CAR - CONTINUOUS

Through his windshield a SERGEANT sees the burning Security
Guard as well as David -- who is covered in blood holding
the screwdriver and screaming like a madman

The strobe lights inside and outside the vestibule continue
to flash Two cars are crashed into the vestibule Robert’s
dead body remains splayed out on the concrete

SERGEANT
What the hell

EXT PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS
The POLICE CARS speed toward this carnival of chaos

From his vantage point now further back toward the
vestibule the Man notices the arriving phalanx of POLICE
CARS For a moment he edges forward considering whether to
complete his attack Instead restraining himself he calmly
slips into the shadows

OUTSIDE THE VESTIBULE
The POLICE CARS come to a SCREECHING halt The Sergeant
SWINGS open his door Stands behind it Trains his weapon

on David

SERGEANT (CONTD)
Get on the ground

A PATROLMAN pulls out a SHOTGUN Points it David

PATROLMAN
Drop the weapon

Still in tremendous pain and unable to see David is non-
compliant He also has some difficulty hearing the Officers
over the glaring sound of the alarm and roaring wind

DAVID
Nowhat I don’t

SCHK-SCHK The Patrolman cocks the SHOTGUN

PATROLMAN
I said drop it

David drops the screwdriver though his wild uncontrollable
movement still appears threatening

Other POLICE OFFICERS pull out their weapons and train them
on David They all tactically inch their way closer to him

SERGEANT
Get on the God damn ground NOW

DAVID
Help mehe’s still here

SERGEANT
(to another Officer)
Move in Move in

Two other Police Officers RUSH David SMASH him down to the
ground Drop a knee into his back Grab at his arms

David struggles Resists

DAVID
He’s right there He’s --

David’s cut short by the weight of an Officer’s baton against
the back of his neck He yells out in pain

Laying prostrate on the ground David’s wrists are
handcuffed

The Firefighters move in fast Attend to the burning
Security Guard

With the Officers still pinning him face-first on the ground
David lifts his head from the concrete Looks toward the
vestibule

The Man is gone

DAVID (CONTD)
No NO

After a beat the Sergeant looks over at the vestibule He
does a double-take after catching a glimpse of Emily’s body --
as well as Corey and Harolds

SERGEANT
We’ve got three more vics near the
vestibule Secure that area

Officers run off toward the vestibule their guns drawn

David is YANKED to his feet and DRAGGED to a squad car He
fights back

DAVID
What are you doing No Wait --

The officers grip tight on David’s arms Their hands feel
like vices against his frozen skin The Officer SHOVES him
into the backseat of the squad car

SLAM He’s locked inside
David’s head slumps against the window of the police car
His eyes burning red his breath stolen from the blow from
the baton all he can do is watch

DISSOLVE TO
MONTAGE

-- A Fire Official turns off the sprinklers and fire alarm as
EMTs lift Emily’s body from the vestibule

-- Police examine the scene noting the broken security
camera and display screen on the ATM

-- Detectives and Crime Scene Analysts photograph and diagram
the scene including Corey’s body

-- A Detective opens the trunk to David’s car Finds
Robert’s wallet as well as the deposit envelope filled with
cash and Corey’s watch He also finds Emily’s cell phone
with 911 dialed and ready to be Sent

-- A Detective holds the spool of wire from David’s tool kit
as he examines the wire perimeter

-- A Detective picks up the SCREWDRIVER with a pair of latex
gloves and places it into an evidence bag

-- Several dead bodies now covered in white sheets are
wheeled on gurneys into the back of ambulances

-- Detectives review the black and white footage from the
security camera located inside the ATM In it they see

David and Corey kicking the windows and the plaster wall
looking as though they’re attempting to break into the ATM

David slamming Corey against the wall and the wrestling match
that follows

David attacking and ultimately strangling Harold with the
wire attached to the signing shelf pen

David shoving Emily landing her hard against the floor

David laying next to Corey covered in blood He moves away
and reveals that Corey has a screwdriver sticking from his
stomach From the camera’s vantage point it appears as
though David stabbed him

And David smashing the ATM with the base of the metal waste
basket until the security camera finally goes to static

But nowhere do they ever see the Man Not in a single
solitary frame of the security camera video Because he
never came within ten feet of the vestibule he remained
outside the camera’s line of sight

It’s as if he was never there

Furthermore the water flooding the vestibule Emily’s fall
and the subsequent action all came after David smashed in
the camera leaving no explanation for how it happened

One of the Detectives presses a button on the video playback
It instantly brings the security camera footage back to an
earlier position -- showing a close-up of David’s face as he
takes money out of his account using the ATM

The close-up image of David’s face remains paused on the
video playback screen like a mugshot

END MONTAGE

The Detectives look at each other One of them holds David’s
swallowed ATM card His name right on it “DAVID HARGROVE”

DISSOLVE TO
EXT PARKING LOT - LATER

An early morning sun peeks over the horizon Police tape
cordons off the crime scene

The area is filled with Police and Fire officials Emergency
lights flash Walkie-talkies crackle

David remains seated in the back of the police car The
Sergeant taps on the back of the squad car Signals the
Patrolman inside

With that the Patrolman starts the car Turns on red and
blues Lets the siren blare

Officers pull back two wooden police barricades allowing the
police car’s egress

The police car cruises through the parting throng of
onlookers and news reporters who have since gathered

INT POLICE CAR - CONTINUOUS

Physically exhausted and emotionally bankrupt David’s head
falls to his chest

He languidly looks out the car window Mixed amongst the
crowd are several people wearing thick dark parkas similar
to the one the Man wore David’s eyes scan to see if the man
is among them

EXT PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS

From within the crowd we watch the police car as it passes
by

David turns and looks out the rear window as the police car
heads further and further down the street

Until it’s gone

FADE TO
INT LOCKERROOM - MORNING
POV - A man’s outstretched arm hangs a THICK PARKA (the
same one the Man wore) up inside a locker His other arm
reaches in and grabs an apron He places the apron over his
head and closes the locker door revealing the reflection of -

- THE MAN (stocky cropped haircut average looking)

END POV The man runs his hands over his 5 o’clock shadow
before walking off

CUT TO
INT COFFEE SHOP - MOMENTS LATER

The man stands behind the counter We push in revealing the
stencil on his apron It reads - Seattle’s Finest Coffee

The push-in continues up to the man’s face He waits
patiently for customers to arrive
