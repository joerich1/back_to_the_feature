Shooting Script

ON BLACK
We hear a whooshing sound getting louder

A BLINK OF AN IMAGE
New York City from a perspective of flight not an
airplane a swooping diving shot Back to black

A WOMANS VOICE
Abre los ojos open your eyes
open your eyes

INT DAVIDS BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING

DAVID AAMES JR 32 swings out of bed and sits on the
corner of his mattress its a chilly New York City
morning Early sunlight glows around the corners of his
curtains

A WOMANS VOICE

open your eyes

He reaches behind him to shut off a slim voice-activated
clock-radio He rises a comforter draped around his
shoulders and heads to the bathroom

INT DAVIDS BATHROOM - MORNING

David regards himself in the mirror of a beautifully-tiled
and well-appointed bathroom in his thirties now his
looks have only deepened and improved He brushes his
teeth He spots a gray hair and holding tweezers seizes
and plucks it

INT DAVIDS BEDROOM - MORNING

David puts on a shirt Checks his wallet for money His
bedroom is elegant and spare
INT DAVIDS NEW YORK CITY APARTMENT - MORNING

He slips down the stairs into the expansive living area of
this deeply-textured apartment A stunning inherited book
collection lines the walls

INTEXT NEW YORK CITY GARAGE BELOW APARTMENTSTREETS -

MORNING
David starts up his dark green sports car and roars onto
the New York City streets

EXT NEW YORK SIDE STREETS u- MORNING

David travels the side-streets to work He senses a

growing weirdness The streets are empty He looks at his
watch Its 812 He continues anxiously Runs a red
light Music rises

EXT TIMES SQUARE -- MORNING

The most recognized piece of real-estate in the world is
silent It is as if the worlds biggest parade has just
left taking everybody with it David pulls over
haphazardly He exits the car leaving it in the middle of
the street He begins to walk faster now as music rises
All the electricity is on There is absolutely nobody in
sight David begins to run searching for humanity The
billboards - electronic and still - all sell easy solutions
to his loneliness He pulls up short stopping and crying
out in anguish There is no one left in the world

A WOMANS VOICE

Open your eyes open your eyes
David

DISSOLVE TO

INT BEDROOM - MORNING

David hangs out of bed his mouth in an open silent scream
Covers his face with both hands
A WOMANS VOICE

open your eyes
He reaches behind to shut off the same clock-radio and its
voice He makes a relieved agonized sound into the
pillow Gets up sees a pizza box a container of
soup a remote control on the floor We hear an incisive
voice with a comforting lilt - a man well meet later

A MANS VOICE
Well I suppose the empty street
meant loneliness

DAVIDS VOICE
Youre a shrink Youve got to do
better than that

A MANS VOICE

Im a doctor Lets not
stereotype each other Not all
rich kids are soul-less and not
all psychologists care about
dreams The question is how you

got here and why youve been
charged

DAVIDS VOICE

What do you want to know I was
about to turn 33 I ran three
magazines and a world-wide
publishing house On most days I
actually fooled myself into
believing it would last forever

INT BATHROOM - MORNING

David checks himself in the mirror Seizes and plucks that
same gray hair

DAVIDS VOICE

Isnt that what being young is
about Believing secretly that
you would be the one person in
the history of man who would live
forever

INT BEDROOM - MORNING

David enters reaching for his wallet repeating the
morning ritual A figure stirs in the bed behind him She
leans upward wearing Davids college basketball tank fora
pajama-top Shes warm and wicked a mildly reformed party
girl the kind of girl first-novels are written about She
is JULIANNA GIANNI25

JULIANNA
Where you going so early

DAVID

(slightly self-conscious)

Hey dont record any more
messages on my alarm--clock okay

JULIANNA
Why not

DAVID
Ill think were married or
something

JULIANNA

Dont you ever say that word Or
Ill never come over here and
bring you chicken soup and fuck
your brains out again

DAVID (OS)
(exiting from other
room)

Hows your cold

JULIANNA
Still there Hows yours

DAVID (US)
I guess you took my mind off it
She pulls a pink pill-box purse from the nightstand
withdraws a multi-colored phone

JULIANNA

Reyna its Julianna I missed my
audition

(dramatic like Bette Davis)

I lost my head Listen I have to
go

(whispers)

Im with David

INT KITCHEN - MORNING

David in his steel-and-linoleum bachelor kitchen Julie
swings into view Her blouse is unbuttoned two buttons

too many down to mid-chest She gives him a kiss on the
cheek and lingers David grabs a racquetball bag talks to
the next room

DAVID

Help yourself to whatever you
want Set the alarm Maria will
clean up Lock up when you go
And you are the greatest

JULIANNA
Bye honey

DAVID
Bye honey Ill call you later

JULIANNA
When When

DAVID
Soon

They have a comfortable healthy mutually satisfying
gloriously superficial relationship

INTEXT NEW YORK CITY GARAGESTREETS - DAY
of

David is about to enter the green sports car then thinks
better of it He fires up a knock-around beater car from
his collection He drives into the street which is
comfortingly now full of people We hear REMs All
The Right Friends

EXT NEW YORK SIDE-STREETS - DAY

David drives the crowded streets It all seems more
poignant today Life is good again

EXT BRIANS APARTMENT - DAY

David pulls up to a lower-end apartment checks his watch
Enter the hung-over BRIAN SHELBY 30ish In a world

acquaintances Brian is a true friend He has all the
qualities of Abe Lincoln and much to his chagrin the
looks too He hops in the car with racquetball bag

DAVID
Did you reserve the court

BRIAN
Easy I cant handle heavy
conversation at this ungodly hour

DAVID
Im sorry to do this early I

gotta be done by 10

Car phone rings David checks Caller ID - its his office
He clicks on

ASSISTANT VOICE (RACHEL)
Youre not going to make the 845

DAVID
How did you find me

RACHELS VOICE
David Aames you have to check the
colors of the letters for the new
issue of Rise

DAVID
What are the colors

RACHELS VOICE
Yellow-and-red or the
traditional white

DAVID
Let me think about it

RACHELS VOICE

the ten oclock with the board

DAVID

Okay but dont tell anybody where
I am I dont care if God calls

BRIAN
Cant you just get rid of that
board

DAVID
The Seven Dwarves No

BRIAN
Those people drive you nuts

DAVID
And that was the desire of my
father who hired them

BRIAN

(suspicious pause)

You fucked Julie Gianni again

David takes off driving

INT ANOTHER STREET - DAY - DRIVING

BRIAN

I know someone was there when I
called You had that tone
(imitates nasal phone

voice)

Oh no man Ive got a cold Im
hanging in tonight

DAVID
(shaky defense)
I had a cold I was alone

BRIAN
Fine You can do whatever you
want with your life -

DAVID
Thanks

BRIAN

-- but one day youll know what
love truly is Its the sour and
the sweet And I know sour which
allows me to appreciate the sweet

DAVID

Julie Gianni is a friend

Sometimes we sleep together

Brian howls in pain like a hurt dog

DAVID

What --

BRIAN

My dream girl Julie Gianni
is your fuck buddy

Brian emits another pained howl David reaches over to
change the music

DAVID
What do you want to listen to

BRIAN
Slow down man

DAVID
What have we got here - Barcelona
Looper Radiohead
There

Brian freezes at what he sees

BRIAN

Look out Look out

David turns and sees hes hurtling into the back of a car
stopped just in front of him Clenching he hits the
brakes narrowly avoiding a high-speech collision And
then to his right another car comes hurtling toward
him and stops within an inch of deadly impact

is an awful moment as the second car blares on the horn
Traffic continues but the lingering feeling of dread and
confusion is still in the air

BRIAN
Fuck

DAVID
(annoyed)
We almost died

BRIAN

I know My own death was right
there in front of me and you know
what happened Your life flashed
before my eyes

DAVID
How was it

BRIAN

Almost worth dying for

Pedestrians continue walking around the honking tangled
mass of the near-accident

EXT AAMES PUBLICATIONS - DAY

David meets Peter Brown and RACHEL his second assistant
at the front of the well-appointed headquarters of Aames
Publications Aames hops out of car and heads into the
building
INT AAMES PUBLICATIONS - DAY

David Aames Jr turns down the corridor of Rise Magazine a
male youth-culture-style magazine Rachel gives him daily
tabloid reports continues with the essentials

RACHEL

The art department needs a
decision on the colors Yellow-
and- red or white And the
board is pissed youre late

DAVID

You changed your hair

David taps on the window of the art department in panic
over several cover mock-ups He gives a presidential
thumbs-up moves on They look at each other trying to
decipher if the thumbs-up was a decision

ART EDITOR

Did he mean the yellow-and-red or

the white

David passes a holdover from the old days older
Receptionist (BEATRICE) who speaks uncomfortably and

gruffly into a headset She gives David a knowing look -
late again

RACHEL
Theyre all waiting for you And
David - opinions are expected

A MANS VOICE

Do you dream about the Board

David The Seven Dwarves as you

call them

David walks into the office Framed original photos from
album covers co-mingle with a splash of cultured art and
books Seven very-interested and very-alert looking Older
Executives wait

DAVID (V0)
Sneezy Bashful Sleepy Happy
Doc Dopey and of course Grumpy

GRUMPY
(skeptical)
How was Aspen

DAVID

(playful mock drama)

Good Now I want answers and I

want them now

(pause)

Hows it going

He gestures charmingly easily and bows with apology over
his lateness All are happy to see him Sort of

DAVIDS VOICE
They still look at me like I was
still eleven years old

FLASHBACK

David at 11 blithely skateboarding the hallways
He

passes Beatrice who turns to an editor

BEATRICE

Hes going to inherit everything
He gets it all

if

INT PRISON PSYCHIATRIC UNIT - NIGHT (INTERROGATION 1)

The light from a small line of chicken-wired windows cuts
through the blackness In the shadows of this dank room
we hear his voice but we do not see him It is the
smaller slightly muffled tone of David Aames In the
shadows he wears a mask

MCCABE
Youre scared of your dreams
arent you

Portrait of CURTIS McCABE 52 Doctor of
Psychiatry
prison division Hes far too wily to spend the currency
of his brilliance just yet Its too early in their
relationship He stands tall leaning on a steel desk
polishing his glasses with end of his coat

DAVID
Its a nightmare either way

MCCABE
Is that how do you explain whats
happened to you

DAVID
What --

MCCABE
What happened to your face

DAVID
Im not talking to you anymore

MCCABE
And you dont want to show me your
face

DAVID
No

MCCABE
Do you know why youre here

DAVID
(sarcastic)
The conversation the coffee --

MCCABE

David - the part where we parry
and joust and get to know each
other bit-by-bit were going to
have to skip it Youve been
charged with murder In four
weeks a judge will determine your
fate based on what I write You
will talk to me --

DAVID

There is no murder It didnt

happen I dont have to talk to

anybody

A Contentious Prison Guard (AARON) swings his feet down and
gets up from watching a 17-inch television on a stool He
exits into the bigger room to quiet down David Aames

Slight push in to show the television show he is watching
and we see a snippet of To Kill A Mockingbird

AARON
You want me to help -

DAVID
Get the fuck away from me

AARON
Take it easy sunshine

DAVID
Get the fuck away from me

AARON

Take it easy Face Your whole

story is full of holes

With great power McCabe advances on the guard His
presence when he turns on the switches is considerable

MCCABE
Stop Please leave Right now
Ill take responsibility

AARON

(whispering exiting)

Im gonna get you Daddys boy
little freak

DAVID
My parents are dead you fuck

MCCABE
Enough
The Contentious Guard leaves

MCCABE
Is it true

DAVID
(sing-song)
Good cop bad cop

MCCABE
That youre a Daddys boy

DAVID

(in darkness by rote)

Primer on David Aames Senior My
father was not built for the 21st
Century He never ate at

McDonalds not once and never
watched television Yet his
biggest magazine is still TV
Digest He and my mother threw
the grandest parties of the
literary world He ballooned
jumped from planes sought
adventure His autobiography is
the manual for every cutthroat
publisher in New York Its
called Defending the Kingdom

MCCABE

Ive read it Page 127 David
Junior was a delight as a child

Did I miss something here Is

that all he wrote about you

DAVID

I dont think he ever got over the

fact that I was terrified of

heights And when he and my

mother were run over by a drunken

teenager on New Years Eve ten

years ago

David Aames moves closer to the light We see a strange
bland expression of his mask at first other--worldly and
then more clearly

DAVID
he left the keys to the
ingdom to me 51 control 49

going to a group of seven board
members who all thought they were
first in line

MCCABE

And you believe the Board the
Seven Dwarves put you here to
take control of your company

DAVID
What do you care

MCCABE

Were just talking And tonights
Wednesday night and I go to Black
Angus for dinner with my daughters
on Wednesday nights so Ill have
to leave soon You understand

that our time is limited dont
you

DAVID

If I talk youll just think Im
crazy

McCabe gathers his things

MCCABE

With all the respect I can offer a
man wearing a latex mask and
spouting conspiracy theories
David trust me - youve crossed
that bridge

DAVID
Fine Enjoy your dinner
Somehow the lilt in McCabes voice draws him closer

MCCABE

There are five basic emotions in
life Tell me what emotion
gripped him before he
entered that cell Was it Guilt
Shadows There is no answer just a rustling and a growing
sense of anticipation in the darkness

MCCABE
Hate Shame
Shadows Still no answer

MCCABE

Revenge

McCabe now shows the invisible skill with which he has
brought his client to the precipice And now with one
word he invites David Aames to look over

MCCABE
Love
In the darkness a rustling and the slight turn of a head

MCCABE
Im completely on the wrong track
arent I

might have in common

David notices that Brian Shelby has arrived with a guest a
Woman who struggles with a package and a very large coat
On first glance shes just another girl On second
glance shes a killer He notes her oddly funny behavior
She removes the coat to reveal a very simple natural
beauty She is SOFIA SERRANO a 27 year-old city girl with
a barely containable life-force Enter PETER BROWN
Davids male assistant with surreptitious headset He
gestures to a stereo appliance set up in Davids living
room

PETER BROWN

David nods still focused on Sofia Suddenly he finds he
cant take his eyes off her

ANGLE ON A HOLOGRAPHIC DISPLAY CONNECTED TO STEREO

An odd and disarmingly beautiful display of Coltrane
performing My Favorite Things in Davids living room
Sofia passes a hand through Coltranes image admires it

ON DAVID

David is approached by THOMAS TIPP a Brit and an
Associate board-member at Aames Publications Tipp is ten
years older than David and he is the rarest of birds A
sentimental lawyer And at the moment hes a bit drunk

DAVID
Hey Tommy
David moves to address him so he can still track Sofia

TIPP

Hey Listen to me Dont blow

You put me up for that other
attorneys job so you didnt have

anything more unbecoming than an
aging mascot I cared about your
father I lived and breathed for
him But these guys the board
they think youre stupid A
Dwarves)

corporate hazard a rogue
But the word stupid is what David heard loudest of all
Nearby we see a Woman Partner (one of the Seven

taking a quick look at David

TIPP

But theyre going to find a way to

get you out Theyre lined up for

your office -

David scans the room Beneath the good cheer he sees the
other layer Lying Disloyalty All part of the
institution he enjoys forgetting exists Each word bashes
his soul

TIPP

-- your job Your life Your

position They are working day

and night to cheat you out of your

51 vote And they are going to

sell this tradition this

tradition of words so they can

eat at a better cafeteria And

what they dont know is this -

(gestures grandly to

books that surround

them)

- people will read again

Davids gaze falls upon Sofia who is looking directly at
him And for one blinding moment something passes between
them She looks away He feels saved

DAVID
(interrupting with
finality)

I got it

TIPP

They even have a nickname for you

behind your back

David smiles faintly Understandingly Tipp kisses him
on the cheek boldly and drunkenly He feels like a hero
to himself

TIPP
Citizen Dildo
David flinches just a little

TIPP
Now youve got great instincts
But I say this with complete love

Claim your life Learn to be an
Asshole Dont be -

DAVID

(extracting himself)
Twos enough -

TIPP
Don t be-
(immediately)

Okay Forgive me I still

believe in this family Even if

its only you

David continues tracking Sofia as he slips over to Peter
Brown

DAVID

Get Tipp out of here drive him

I love living here And I refuse
to clean up

DAVID
No problem

SOFIA

Ive got to work around the clock

to keep this place

David eases the dog away as he examines the oddly exquisite
dolls He grabs a look at her in the other room A bit of
leg between boot and skirt As he admires the dolls

DAVID
So youre really a dancer huh
SOFIA

For 14 years But I dont dance

like you dance

She laughs to herself steals a look at him Turns away

INT KITCHEN - NIGHT

SOFIA
Do you want something to drink

DAVID
Sure
David looks at her refrigerator A note reads Call Dad
An odd epiphany occurs as he sees the collage of photos

that represent a hard-working hard-earned committed and
passionate life

Shot moves across the photos A young girl living a young
girls hard-working and happy life Group photos of co-
workers A few from a vacation A whole new cast of
characters all committed and they all look inviting to
him And one gloriously random photo of her in Cabo San
Lucas raising a toast with friends

DAVID
I like your life

SOFIA

Well its mine and you cant have

it

David examines a humorously embarrassing vacation photo of
a sloshed Sofia a guys arm reaching for her breast
Dedication reads To Sergio Marry me

DAVID
I do not want to know the story
behind this photo Whos Sergio

SOFIA
Its a nickname

DAVID
Your nickname is Sergio

SOFIA
Its a long story and we dont
know each other

DAVID
So many secrets

SOFIA
Thats because Im really an arms
dealer

DAVID
Ive never known an arms dealer

SOFIA

You do now What about you

David freezes And then decides what the hell - to tell
the truth

DAVID
Citizen Dildo

SOFIA
Youre not staying over

DAVID

(still stung over

nickname)

Never run a company Stay an
artist Stay an arms dealer

SOFIA

Oh please Somehow I cant play
the violin for you

Although It must be hard
controlling all those peoples
lives Everyone at that party is
connected to you for survival in
some way it seems
David looks at her mentally assessing her level of guile

SOFIA

12000 proposals

SOFIA

(playful self-
deprecating)

SOFIA

Do you want to hear Jeff
Buckley or Vikki Carr

DAVID

Jeff Buckley or Vikki Carr

He continues looking Flashes of the photos on her
refrigerator

SOFIA
Everyone said dont go to New
York But I just think good

things will happen if youre a

good person with a good attitude

Doncha think

He regards her Hes a little restless and a lot
enchanted Is she for real

SOFIA
You think Im naive
He decides shes for real He turns back to the photos on
her fridge

DAVID
No I really dont

DAVID (V0)

I dug her completely Somehow I
had found the last semi-guileless
girl in New York City

SOFIA
I have to get to sleep
Truthfully -- Im also working

mornings as a dental assistant

DAVID

(to himself)

Boy am I going to the wrong
dentist

MCCABE (V0)
And you didnt immediately want to
sleep with her

romantic style)

DAVID (V0)

(toying with the shrink)

a quick sweet kiss on his mouth He stays for an extra
moment kissing just her upper lip leaving no doubt as to
the potential of their future And then very close she
says

I meant that to be your forehead
David stands He looks around the small apartment

DAVID

Thank you for the inspiration I

will now attempt to run my

crossroads Silently she roots for him like crazy

a wool hat He looks noble an assembled victim a modern
miracle He looks like many things But he no longer

looks like David Aames The truck moves through frame

INT HOSPITAL CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

A dashing-looking surgeon dripping with confidence DR
POMERANZ talks with David
DR POMERANZ

The cranial structure was based on
thirty pins fastened by small
panels and bits of bone from the
mandible and it seems the
cartilage grafts have maintained
your cheek structure
Unfortunately because you were in
a coma immediate plastic surgery
was impossible

DAVID (V0)
Doctors Their power is in
jargon So you study up

DAVID

Is that the procedure for all
Bilateral Periorbital Hematomas in
a LeFort III fracture of a
comatose patient

DR POMERANZ

(pleasantly surprised)

In a LeFort III - absolutely The
potential for sub-cranial brain
damage was too great

DAVID (v0)
you do your best
David consults a list hes made

DAVID
And beyond the cheek grafts Dr
Pomeranz is are the pins fastened

with any kind of aluminum which
could ionize and cause that
pressure in my head Because Im
ready for another operation

ANGLE SHIFTS TO REVEAL
three other doctors in the room listening
DR POMERANZ
Yes we are working on processes

But it youre specifically not
at the stage where we can
experiment --

DAVID

Experiment Use me

DR POMERANZ
The headaches will go away -

DAVID

These are more than headaches
This is like a steel plate slicing
through my every thought

DR POMERANZ
Were not cowboys We cant just
wing it

DAVID
Because I cant think straight
most of the time

DR POMERANZ
We can increase your medication

DAVID
Yes Medication

DR POMERANZ

And there are things well
continue to investigate But

there are so many others whove
not been able to benefit
aesthetically from plastic surgery
as you have --

DAVID

This isnt about vanity Dr
Pomeranz

(keeping rage bottled)

This isnt about vanity This is
about functioning in the world

It is my job to be out there
functioning Ive got the money
and Ill pay any amount Invent
something Play jazz You say
youre the best face man in New
York City Fucking prove it

OTHER DOCTOR
We could do something about your
arm --

DAVID
Fuck my arm
Dr Pomeranz looks over to a young assistant

DR POMERANZ

Nobody here takes your feelings
for granted We did prepare
something for you based on the
preliminary examination

DAVID
Tell me Bring it on

DR POMERANZ

Its sometimes useful in the early

stages of rejection Its a

facial prosthetic It was two

weeks in the making

The assistant opens a black-leather bound box In it is
the mask - molded from Davids own face locked into a
pleasant bland expression

DAVID
A facial prosthetic

DR POMERANZ
The aesthetic replacement does
work Emotionally and actually

OTHER DOCTOR

(helpfully)

And the plastic in the aesthetic
shield also filters out abusive
rays and assists in the
regeneration of cells

DAVID
So its an aesthetic regenerative
shield

DR POMERANZ
Thats correct Exactly

THIRD DOCTOR

And the ergonomics of the plate-
barrier allows it to reflexively
interact with the movements of
your own face

DAVID
I see --

DR POMERANZ
Its a helpful unit

DAVID

Good Because for a minute there
I thought we were talking about a
fucking mask

DR POMERANZ

(beat)

Its only a mask if you treat it
that way

DAVID

No its great This completely

takes care of Halloween But what

about the other 364 days of the

Does she even recognize him He moves closer attempting
an easy-going persona We hear nothing but the sound of
his heart pounding in odd counter-rhythm to her dancing
Finally she stops

BARMAN
No This is on the house

DAVID
Why -

BARMAN

(odd compassion)

It just is Bitch

David looks across the club to see Sofia A Clubgoer Guy
whispers something in her ear She shakes it off He
pounds down another shot at the bar this time with the
Barman

DAVID

Patron

David regards a video monitor behind the bar Someones
camera is fixed on Sofia dancing with Brian and another
good-looking Young Man She playfully shoves the good-
looking Young Man away not unlike the move that won David

over lo those many nights ago at her apartment He pounds
back another drink

INT CLUB BATHROOM - NIGHT

Weaving at the urinal David pees Squeezes his temples to
ward off a headache

CLUBGOER 1

Dude fix your face

The Clubgoers laugh David laughs too Suddenly he feels
better

INT CLUB - NIGHT

David moves through the crowd powered by a new sense of
belonging The music swirls and takes him along with it
He dances wildly In the strobing darkness he is
anonymous moving with the group lost as one David takes
the mask and pulls it over his head backwards In
profile his two faces stare in opposite directions David
sees his moment Sofia is alone near the corner of the

club He approaches her

DAVID
Hello again

SOFIA
Hello again

DAVID

Idea Lets start all over

He regards her for a moment sees her apprehension and
discomfort

DAVID

How about if you help me Unless
Im horning in here -

(beat does her)

You are But the food is good
He continues taking a step

DAVID

See Ive got a little problem
Ive got a stalker

(does her)

It doesnt sound life-threatening
(does himself self-

deprecating)

I need a cover I need for you to
pretend were having a

scintillating conversation and
youre wildly entertained I know

(does her with head nod)

Ill improvise

SOFIA
(a touch playful)
I dont talk like that

DAVID
Shes right across the room and
shes burning a hole in my back

SOFIA
Red dress strappy shoes

DAVID

Thats right

Their heads are close together looking off into the club
David doesnt notice that Sofia is having a hard time
playing along with this game She is overwhelmed holding
it in David continues

DAVID
I think she s the saddest girl to
ever hold a martini

SOFIA
(about to burst)

DAVID

SOFIA

David looks at her His eyes flash at her choice of words
Perhaps there is hope Sofia stares at him worried about
his sanity as he goes overboard with his praise of her turn
of a phrase Push into close-ups as they struggle to deal
with the discomfort of this moment

DAVID

I dont believe you just said
that That is the best thing Ive
ever heard That is hilarious
God that just killed me The way
you said that See - thats what

I love about you Ill tell you

Brian stops one last time irritated at the far end of the
street

DAVID

Brian needs to rid himself of David He turns and runs in
the direction of Sofia

David feels the deep pangs of rejection Breathing hard
His head hurts His body hurts

DAVID

Beat He sprints down the middle of the street after
Brian

EXT CLUB STREETSOFIAS APARTMENT - NIGHT
David runs frantically heartbroken and sobbing
HIS MIND

Brian catches up to Sofia She turns relieved They kiss
messily hungrily Her shoes arch to reach his height
David runs the streets nearing her home The images are
tearing his mind apart He stops and leans against a car
unsteady and nauseous Holding his head in pain he
manages to run further

David stops on the street outside her apartment His sobs
overwhelm him He drops to the pavement He passes out
mouth agape The empty street visible in the bg his
hand loosens its grip on the mask

FADE TO BLACK

WOMANS VOICE
Open your eyes open your
eyes

EXT SOFIAS APARTMENT -- EARLY MORNING

David is passed out the mask is still clutched in his
hand A Butterfly crosses frame A hand enters resting
on his shoulder

WOMANS VOICE

This is a cheap ploy for sympathy

David wakes up and looks into the kind face of Julie
Gianni

JULIANNA

Boo

He recoils His vision sharpens In the morning shadows
with increasing focus we see that it is actually Sofia

DAVID
No Im okay -

DAVID POV

Sofia examines him with a look of concern and
understanding Everything takes on a clear and sharp
focus Behind her is a beautiful vanilla sky

SOFIA
And it worked Get up
DAVID
Ugh -

SOFIA

DAVID

(groggy)

Sofia speaks with rapid-fire conviction as if she might
change her mind if she thought about it too much

SOFIA

I dont have a mother-savior bone
in my body Its not about that
Youre coming inside But if this

turns out to be a big mistake I
do have the ability to fall out of
love with you -

(snaps fingers)

was a real loner And one day he
woke up at 40 with two daughters
who lit his life up with purpose
Suddenly he goes to endless school
plays he gets home at 920

INT FLORENTINES BAR AND GRILL - DAY

Sofia laughs A perfect laugh David admires her sits
next to her holding her hand Theirs is the unmistakable
closeness of a couple in the first real throes of a sexual
relationship They share a giddy open secret Across the

Sofia speaks sweetly and passionately to David in Spanish
David replies knowingly - si - every few words

deep communication She exits

Brian shakes his head

DAVID
Hows things Brian

BRIAN
Fine
Davids face is huge in the Brians viewfinder

DAVID
Hows things Brian

BRIAN

Dont flatter yourself Im fine

Besides - Sofia is great but by

proximity infatuation

Brian naturally suspicious and somewhat jealous

spots a
writer at a nearby table making notes

BRIAN

(to writer)

And dont use that its mine
The writer looks busted

DAVID
Whered you get the camera

BRIAN

a bemused smile A plate of food sits in front of him
His eyes suggest a piercing intellect he looks at David
with deep familiarity David cant quite place the face

INT BEDROOMBATHROOM - NIGHT

He turns on the light fills the glass with water Looks

up into the restored mirror His face is disfigured He
recoils in terror knocking against a towel rack sinking
to the floor and grabbing a look at a shiny surface on the
lower cabinet

Sofia bolts upright She sees him on the floor across the
room sees his face and backs up in the bed leaning on her
arm screaming

INT DAVIDS BEDROOM - NIGHT

her neck He caresses her body She kisses his

fingertips Her back to him Tangled in sheets they ease
into lovemaking with the perfect fit of two bodies meant
for each other He gently grabs a handful of her hair

His hand stops Its not Sofias hair He slowly turns
her face to his and we glimpse David over the shoulder of
the woman who is not Sofia He leaps out of bed falling
to the floor the sheet tangled around him He turns on
the light
Julie Gianni hides her face from the light like a night
animal caught in the intrusive glare of day

When she speaks it is with Sofias cadence and accent

Baby whats wrong

He gasps for breath backing away Totally terrified
Paralyzed In a low voice

DAVID
Where Is She

JULIANNA

His instinct is to protect his lifeline Sofia - and he
pounces on her with a manic will to survive

Julie Gianni looks a little loopy almost stoned
Taunting

JULIANNA

INT BEDROOM -- NIGHT - MINUTES LATER

David dismantles the phone takes the cord He ties her
willing hands to the posts of the bed She protests oddly
like an actress playing a part

DAVID

Now Im going to make sure that I

David pulls his pants on frantically opens the wardrobe
closet No Sofia Goes to the kitchen No Sofia Julie
sobs quietly sweetly tied to the bed She behaves and
acts like Sofia

JULIANNA

David returns and sits across from her on the bed
terrified and barely hanging on

INT SOFIAS APARTMENT - DAY - FLASHBACK

The clown figurine on her stove-top falls over as we hear
the front door kicked in David enters slamming the door
behind him He looks around what was once the site of such
happiness The same details hed glimpsed long ago are now
horrifying to him He looks at a photo on the
refrigerator The same note Call Dad The exact
expression exact photograph hed seen on his earlier
visit Now it is Julie who is in her place

He opens her drawer Just some papers And then the
drawing hed once done of her Now featuring Julie He
rips up the drawing and proceeds to destroy the apartment
until he stops collecting himself Takes a breath and
Smash A lamp is broken over his head Julie Gianni bends
down to help him A shard of the lamp-base is still in her
hand Julies whole demeanor is that of a different girl
Even her voice is softer almost exactly the knock-around
sweetness of Sofia

JULIANNA
I thought you were a vandal

DAVID

(with difficulty)
Who are you
JULIANNA

Im Sofia

DAVID
You are not Sofia youre not
Sofia

JULIANNA

and soul

JULIANNA

over soon Well be together

again Youll forget Julianna and

I wont be afraid of you Let me

get you a cold towel

She exits He struggles to rise His head is a swirling
mess And then

ON KITCHEN DOORWAY
Sofia slowly returns with towel Her image still blurry
David advances and faints into her arms

DAVID

SOFIA

(whispers)

Yes David Im Sofia Im Sofia

He accepts it all of it whatever it is just to hold her
They kiss gently then more powerfully

INT SOFIAS BEDROOM - DAY

They make love emotionally and deeply Two bodies
yearning to possess the other Camera moves across their
bodies as David wipes frame to black as the move
continues onto her back

DAVID
Where were you
Sofia doesnt answer doesnt want to lose the moment

DAVID

I dont want to know

(thrusting)

Just tell me you love me

David keeps his face buried in her shoulder He doesnt
want to look The passion gives way to a mounting dread
as he hears a voice almost like Sofias

JULIANNA (0S)

I love you Im afraid of how

powerful this is

He continues moving passionately harder now Julie
responds to the overwhelming surge within David She gives
over to the waves of dark pleasure riding him like a
rocket from hell Harder now Grabbing her hands and
pulling them high above her head clamping down with his
own

Julie Gianni cries a deep guttural sound of passion

This is what someone sounds like when theyre not faking
it And then slam a pillow comes down over her face

DAVID

What the fuck is happening

Julie begins to react to what is clearly no longer an
advanced lovemaking session

DAVID
I want to see your face
She grabs at the pillow

DAVID

I want to see your face

David reaches orgasm sobbing recklessly out of control
Julies body stops kicking and settles into silence He
loosens the pillow and is rewarded with one last violent
attempt at life Her hand smacks his neck Hes so taut
it bounces off She grabs at his face one last time her
hand is left with enough power only to caress his face
She goes limp Silence Davids crying turns to a
whimper He looks at the pillow over Julies head Hes
confused a puddle of jagged adrenaline He doesnt want
to remove the pillow for fear of who could be underneath
He rises up his elbow across her lifeless chest With
true horror he knows he has to move his hand but his hand
will reveal who hes just killed

ON HER TORSO

as his arm moves inexorably away from her chest Quarter-
inch by quarter-inch he inches it downward across the top
of her breasts dreading the inevitable not seeing it
and then there it is The mole between her breasts

INT HALLWAY STAIRS - DAY
David exits hurriedly past some tenants down the stairs
He looks up at his own reflection in the hallway mirror

He looks horribly disfigured We hear the sound of
breathing encased in a mask

INT PRISON PSYCHIATRIC UNIT - NIGHT - (INTERROGATION 4)

McCabe sits across from David McCabe looks away haunted
by the admission of guilt

DAVID

I did it didnt I I dont
feel like I killed someone I
feel like

MCCABE
David who

DAVID
Im in a dream

MCCABE
was the man at the restaurant
David shakes his head

MCCABE

(pained)

Sometimes the mind behaves as if
it were in a dream Faces change
people become other people The
subconscious is a powerful thing
You treated Julie carelessly
didnt you David Your feeling
of responsibility or guilt over
Julie might have easily turned
Sofia into Julie

(pause)

Do you know what derangement is

DAVID
I need your help
MCCABE

All I know is you killed your
girlfriend and I dont know whats
in your mind

DAVID
I need your help

MCCABE
Id work on this case forever if I
could but weve run out of time

DAVID
What will you plead

MCCABE

Temporary derangement Its your
best chance They wont believe
me

DAVID
What do you believe

MCCABE

Believe it or not I care about

you Youve become like family to

me I dont want to give up on

you

David looks at him oddly Suddenly the archetype seems
very familiar McCabe continues with the noble concern of
a towering father figure

MCCABE

(continued)

But I needed more I needed an
answer I I even thought there

was more than a good chance
someone was playing tricks on you
Maybe it was the board But I
cant exceed my duties here Im
just a psychologist and I have to
leave you

DAVID
Will I see you at the trial

MCCABE

No Im just the opening act

ON HALLWAY WALLS

Containing monitors with video-taped tour guides
Talking heads expressing the convictions of Life Extension
Compassionate expressive people The bits of their
testimonials echo phrases from Davids own life

PATIENT 1

-and Im not a true believer
by nature But the older you get
the more you see the flow of the
future and I made a choice

PATIENT 2

-why not embrace the future I

Believe the research - the future

spiritual and the scientific

Annoyed at everything around him McCabe pulls David
onward

Evolve and Re-Experience peppered with colorful photos of
simple life-affirming portraits of everyday life Its
well-appointed and well-marketed organization

Account Liaison REBECCA DEARBORN enters with paperwork
She is an electric presence Efficient caring and oddly
compassionate

DEARBORN

Mr McCabe how are you Im
Rebecca Dearborn

(quick notice of mask)

Life Extension or LE as we like
to refer to it is a glimpse of
the future a ticket not in
the juvenile sense but in the
deeply meaningful sense that can
only be borne in the human heart

The DNA codes of the human body

have been broken Soon heart

ailments cancer and so much more

will be a thing of the past Very

simply your anguish your

discontent even your death is

no longer necessary ina

traditional sense Whatever

malady that hides behind that

mask is temporary

She looks directly at David and it stirs him McCabe
studies her and the operation He thirsts for clues
David flips through the folder - toward the back a panel
of photos of storage tanks Lavishly and warmly
photographed just like next years cars in a magazine

DEARBORN

Within an hour of your passing

LE will transfer your body to a

vessel where you will be sealed

and frozen at 196 degrees below
zero Power outages earthquakes

nothing will effect your

suspension-hibernation

MCCABE
Did you sign this contract David
David looks down at pamphlet looks up

DAVID
Whats the Lucid Dream option

DEARBORN

Good choice The Lucid Dream is
Life Extensions newest option
For a little extra we offer the
cryonic union of science and
entertainment

MCCABE
(rueful skeptical)
Cryo-tainment
generic

Dearborn spreads apart the paperwork on her desk to reveal
a thin Video Monitor built into the glass table-top Aames
and McCabe peer into the table--top as Dearborn presses

worried for him

MCCABE

DEARBORN

(continuing)

-but this is a serious business
The Lucid Dream is worth the risk

And what is any life if not the

pursuit of a dream The dream of

peace The dream of achievement

The dream of hearing someone

saying these words when they

truly mean them

David is deeply moved as he listens Somewhere music
begins to play It is The Beach Boys Good Vibrations

McCabe comes flying out of the door

MCCABE

David Listen to me These
people are dangerous Were in
trouble We need to get off this
roof now

MCC DAVID
Who turns from McCabe to Ventura
Ventura leads David away

VENTURA

Were now on pause And youre
about to return to your Lucid
Dream

(continuing)

with all of the upgrades You
wont remember any of this nor be
charged for the technical support
it is now your moment of choice
You can return to your Lucid
Dream and live a beautiful life

with Sofia or whomever you

wish or you can choose the

world out there

Ventura gestures to the city beyond as they come to a
halt

CLOSE ON DAVID

DAVID

The world out there And you can
bring me back just like Benny the
Dog

CLOSE ON VENTURA
The client is starting to understand

VENTURA

Yes Just like Benny the Dog

Your face and body can now be

fixed of course But its very

different out there now Your

finances wont last long Your

panel of observers are waiting for

you to choose

Ventura gestures into the camera He begins walking
backwards to the roofs ledge

VENTURA

There are no guarantees But

remember even in the future the

sweet is never as sweet without

the sour

David sees that Brian Shelby has now joined McCabe on the
roof He nods to Brian who nods back

DAVID
How do I wake up

VENTURA
The decision is yours
Ventura glances over the edge

DAVID
And I chose this scenario didnt

I

VENTURA

(enjoying that he

understands)

Yes to face your last remaining
fear of heights

MCCABE

David dont listen to him You

were right This is the Seven

Dwarves Its a set up You

cant trust him

David looks at McCabe with compassion

VENTURA

Dont feel bad David This
winning man is your creation
Its in his nature to fight for
his existence But hes not real

CLOSE ON DAVID

McCabe fights for himself

MCCABE
Im real I have two daughters
You know that

VENTURA
What are their names

MCCABE

CLOSE ON DAVID
who feels for McCabe as the apparition crumbles

MCCABE

Mortality as home entertainment

This cannot be the future Can

it

David regards McCabe Once dynamic McCabe now seems
unsure of his own existence Slowly always looking at
David he settles into the truth of his very being With
great nobility McCabe shoves his hands into his pockets
and faces his own destiny or lack thereof

MCCABE
(quietly)
Goodbye

VENTURA

Its been a brilliant journey of
self-awakening and youve simply
got to ask yourself -- what is
happiness to you

CLOSE PUSH IN ON DAVID AAMES
His moment of realization

DAVID
I want to live a real life I
dont want to dream any longer

VENTURA
Any last wishes

DAVID
Let them out there read my mind

VENTURA

I wish you well David

Music rises as he turns to see Sofia He moves to her
She touches his cheek His face is restored They
embrace

DAVID
Look at us Im frozen and
youre dead And I love you

SOFIA
Its a problem

DAVID
I lost you when I got in that car
Im sorry
She looks at him beguiling and understanding

DAVID

But remember what you told me
once Every passing minute is
another chance to turn it all
around

She kisses him

SOFIA

Ill find you again

She regards her lost love taking him in David treasures
his last moments with her

David takes a breath and begins backing to the ledge

DAVID

Ill see you in another life when

we are both cats

David backs up and begins to run He arrives at the edge
looking down at the distance to the ground stopping
himself at the precipice

He looks back to Sofia one last time and then leaps out
into the celestial future For a fraction of a moment he
is suspended in mid-air And he hurtles to the ground
And the ground hurtles to meet him

SERIES OF IMAGES

It is the little things the random poetic instances of
David Aames life that come back to him Music rises as he
realizes finally his own true poetry and humanity The
images topple onto each other with the rhythm of his
heartbeat Father Mother A casual glance of a

stranger All combine to give his life meaning And then
finally we see the face of the one person who gave him
purpose in this life and the next Sofia

TO WHITE
The sound of a breath A gulp of life Someones heart is
beating

A WOMANS VOICE

Relax relax David open your

eyes

An eye opens and the pupil darts to the right and left
Life again

A WOMANS VOICE
open your eyes
THE END
