FADE IN
ON A WINDSHIELD

Rain drops splatter across the glass streak down

MILES HALTER’S VOICE
I am fascinated by last words

WINDSHIELD WIPERS clear out the rain and though it’s
blurry we see the HIGHWAY it’s dark save for our
headlights

And the CHERRY LIGHTS of a POLICE CAR up ahead

MILES HALTER’S VOICE (CONT’D)
Like Dylan Thomas who said “I’ve
had eighteen straight whiskeys I
do believe that’s a record” and
then died Or Henry Ward Beecher
whos final words were “Now comes
the mystery”

A JACK-KNIFED TRUCK blocks most of the highway A couple COP
CARS surround it POLICE OFFICERS a TRUCK DRIVER survey the
situation

MILES HALTER’S VOICE (CONT’D)
Eugene O’Neil’s “Born in a hotel
room and - God damn it - died ina
hotel room”

EXT HIGHWAY 1-65 -- NIGHT

WIDE We see a blue piece of shit car heading towards this
BLOCKADE Doesn’t seem to be slowing down any

MILES HALTER’S VOICE
Movie star James Dean said
“They’ve got to see us” just
before slamming his Porsche into
another car

ON THE POLICE OFFICERS -- as they see this car

THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD -- windshield wipers methodically
going Were bearing down on the TRUCK the COP CARS

ON THE WHEELS -- spinning on the slick highway asphalt

ON THE COPS -- as they begin to scatter Holy shit
MILES HALTER’S VOICE (CONT’D)
The french poet Francois Rabelais’
last words were “I go to seek the
Great Perhaps” And that’s what I
was after too

And then -- without hesitation or remorse --

WHAM An awesome COLLISION -- as the blue piece of shit CAR
just PLOWS into the COP CARS --

GLASS shatters Steel and metal SCREAMING DEAFENING
The car FLIPS -- almost balletic Something beautiful about
it

MILES HALTER’S VOICE (CONTD)
Except I wanted to find the Great
Perhaps before I died

WHAM The car hits the road FLIPS again SPINS And then
stops

As fast as that it’s over The blue piece of shit car
CRUSHED Cop cars TOTALED

SILENCE Save for the rain And an awful HISS from the
wreckage

MILES HALTER’S VOICE (CONT’D)
I know so many last words But I
will never know hers
As we fade to BLACK
ONE SIMPLE WORD FILLS THE SCREEN
before
INT MILES HALTER’S HOUSE -- DAY
A HANDMADE BANNER READS “GOODBYE TO MILES”

Beneath it sits MILES HALTER 16 soul of an old man body of
a gangly teenager His MOTHER and FATHER endlessly patient
and forgiving flank him on the living room couch

Before them on the coffee table Champagne poppers
Artichoke dip Streamers A party that no one is attending

MR HALTER
It’s still four minutes to five
I’m sure people will come
MILES
Because I’ve been keeping my
popularity secret all these years

A long uncomfortable beat

MRS HALTER
Is this why you want to leave

CREDITS OVER --

The HALTER’S SUV driving through the rural beauty of
Birmingham Alabama A FLORIDA license plate and a WELCOME
TO ALABAMA sign let us know from where and to where we go

The car pulls through the wrought iron gates of the CULVER
CREEK BOARDING SCHOOL Miles takes in the whole view

An expanse of athletic fields old brick buildings
STUDENTS excited to be there Idyllic as Miles
imagined

And as the SUV rounds a corner it passes --
A girl The girl

ALASKA YOUNG Out on the lawn Light cascading through the
eaves creates a halo around her She looks up - a plucked
four leaf clover in hand

A moment as their eyes meet Miles has never seen a girl who
looked like this She smiles enigmatic mysterious Sweet
and dangerous at the same time

And then the SUV drives on Miles looks back -- the sun in
his eyes blocking his view But he’s just glimpsed the
possibility of his new life

INT MILESS DORM -- DAY

Mrs Halter cries Sitting on Miles’s bed Mr Halter
investigates

MR HALTER
Place looks exactly as I
remember

MRS HALTER
(choking sobs)
We’re going to miss you So much

Mr Halter checks the SMOKE DETECTOR Pushing in the button
MR HALTER
Fresh batteries in the smoke
detector Very important

MILES
Ok Thanks dad

Mr Halter walks to the window Opens it

MR HALTER
Window slides right open Miles
Makes an excellent alternative
exit

MILES
I’1l keep that in mind if the
school is taken hostage

MR HALTER
Be smart Be safe
(with a knowing smile)
Don’t follow in your old man’s
footsteps

MILES
Yes dad I know You were a real
hellraiser here

MR HALTER
I still remember the look on
Headmaster Beckman’s face when we --

MILES AND MRS HALTER
(heard it before)
Buried the school bell in the
cemetary

MR HALTER
Best prank in Culver history And
that’s saying something

MRS HALTER
You want help getting settled

MILES
I got it Before the adventure
comes the unpacking Right

Mrs Halter rises Hugs Miles His father joins in too
They stand in a huddle OFF THIS AWKWARD EMBRACE

VARIOUS SHOTS OF
-- Miles looking out the window as his parents drive away
This is real

-- A STACK OF BIOGRAPHIES JFK James Joyce Humphrey Bogart
Next to his bed Nothing but biographies As Miles tapes a
map of the world to the cinderblock walls

-- Miles sits on his bare mattress in this bare room Alone
EXT CULVER CREEK -- MILES’S DORM -- DAY

Miles stands looking out at the hexagram of dorms that
surround a small quad A group of students meet up in front
of him Hugging

ON MILES -- watching Suddenly one of the students a hearty
young man looks over --

HEARTY YOUNG MAN
Hey Is this your first year

MILES
(thrilled surprised)
Yeah
(but then cooler)
Yes I’m from Florida

A HEARTY YOUNG GIRL with him smiles

HEARTY YOUNG GIRL
Florida Cool So you’re used to
the heat

MILES
I wouldn’t be used to the heat if I
were from Hades

Suddenly the group of students begin laughing A chorus of
“Hades That’s funny” “Miles -- you’re a riot”
Backslapping Flirtatious looks from the girls

On Miles -- accepted Beloved Cool And then --

BACK TO REALITY

Miles stands there alone The hugging students continue to
hug catch up and then walk off Miles invisible to them

INT MILESS DORM -- BATHROOM -- DAY
Miles in the shower The shower head much too low for him

He squats Turns on the water It dribbles Miles tries to
position himself to get a droplet of water on his head
Has he made a terrible mistake
INT MILESS DORM -- DAY

Miles enters his room A small towel wrapped around his
waist Suddenly the front door opens --

CHIP MARTIN aka THE COLONEL enters Five foot even But
buff A small angry tank of a kid Miles is caught off
guard -- feeling self conscious being undressed

MILES
Oh Hi Sorry -- um --

THE COLONEL
Chip Martin I’d shake your hand
but I think you should hold on damn
tight to that towel til you put
some clothes on

Miles grabs some clothes scrambling
MILES
Yeah Right Sorry I’m Miles

Halter Ill just be a sec

THE COLONEL
Miles huh As in “to go before I
sleep”
(off Miles)
Robert Frost Never read him

MILES
No I havent

THE COLONEL
Youre fucking lucky
(re Miles in his towel)
So you gonna stand there ‘til the
visual is burned in my brain and I
can no longer achieve tumescence

Miles clothes in hand disappears behind the bathroom door
INT CULVER CREEK -- MILES’S BATHROOM -- INTERCUT

As Miles get dressed the Colonel begins unpacking Which
consists of throwing his clothes everywhere Socks shirts
pants stuffed into any available drawer No rhyme or reason

Miles tries to make conversation through the door

MILES
Where are your parents
THE COLONEL

My parents The father’s in
California right now Maybe
sitting in his La-Z-Boy Maybe
driving his truck Either way he’s
wasted Probably pissed himself
Or beating the shit outta somebody

(beat)
My mom just dropped me off

MILES
Oh Got it

Miles re-enters the bedroom Dressed Not sure how to
address this angry little man The Colonel points to the MAP
on the wall

THE COLONEL

I see youve done some decorating
I like it

(matter of fact while

unpacking
Afghanistan Albania Algeria
American Samoa Andorra Angola
Anguilla Antigua Argentina
Armenia Aruba Australia
Austria Azerbaijan

(off Miles -- confused)
I could do the rest but Id
probably bore you

The Colonel surveys his unpacking job Clothes everywhere
He seems pleased He turns back to Miles

THE COLONEL
They call me the Colonel And
well call you Pudge
(off Miles -- huh)
It’s called irony

The Colonel walks out of the room Leaving Miles feeling
like he got hit by a tornado The Colonel re-enters

THE COLONEL
Cmon Pudge We got shit to do

INT MILESS DORM -- HALLWAY -- MOMENTS LATER
The Colonel marches down the hall Miles tries to keep up
MILES

Thats amazing Memorizing the
countries like that --
THE COLONEL
Yeah everybody’s got a talent I
can memorize things And you

MILES
I know a lot of peoples last
words

THE COLONEL
Example

MILES
Henrik Ibsen He was a playwright

THE COLONEL
I know You like his plays

MILES
Never read them But well -- hed
been sick for a while and his nurse
said “You seem to be feeling better
this morning” and Ibsen said “On
the contrary” And then he died

A beat And then the Colonel laughs

THE COLONEL
Thats morbid I like it

The Colonel starts walking again Miles tries to follow
The Colonel stops in front of a door Music BLASTING from
inside As he goes to knock he first puts up a hand

THE COLONEL
(explains)
She can be moody Wait here

The Colonel knocks once On the door is a DRY ERASE BOARD
Reads ALASKA and MARYA 4-EVAH From inside

GIRL’S VOICE
Omigod Get your ass in here you
short little man

The Colonel enters Leaves the door ajar And Miles alone
He can hear the GIRL inside telling a story laughing

Miles steps to the crack in the door And he sees in brief
flashes --

ALASKA The girl from earlier Hugging the Colonel Shes
in cutoff jeans a peach tank-top and barefoot And there’s
no doubt -- she is the hottest girl in history
She moves in and out of view Animated Behind her STACKS
OF BOOKS From FLOOR TO MID WALL Hundreds of books

And then ALASKA looks to the door Sees Miles looking He
jumps back Into the shadows As the door SHUTS

PRE-LAP

THE COLONEL (V0O)
Her name is Alaska Alaska Young

EXT CULVER CREEK -- WOODS -- SUNSET
The Colonel is on the march again Miles keeps up

They step over fallen branches cross over an old BRIDGE It
feels like they’re entering a hidden secret world

THE COLONEL
She’s from Vine Station Alabama
You could drive past it without
noticing -- and from what I
understand you ought to
Roommate’s name is Marya Also
hot Also has a boyfriend

MILES
Alaska has a boyfriend Serious

THE COLONEL
She hasn’t cheated on him Which
is a first

MILES
(processing this)
Oh I see

THE COLONEL
Enough with the Alaska Pudge By
my count there are one hundred
thirty two girls at this school and
every last one of them is less
crazy than her

As Miles absorbs this many more questions

EXT SMOKING HOLE -- LATER

Miles and Colonel have arrived at the hidden oasis known as
The Smoking Hole Which consists of a slab of concrete with

three plastic chairs Beneath a bridge Looking out on the
lake The Colonel lights a cigarette Offers it to Miles

MILES
(never smoked before)
Is it safe

THE COLONEL
That’s why it’s called the Smoking
Hole

Miles does his best to look cool inhaling but HACKS
VIOLENTLY Wheezing Gasping The Colonel ignores this
Points across the lake -- a white speck flapping its wings

THE COLONEL
See that

MILES
(still coughing)
Yeah Is thata bird

THE COLONEL
Its the Swan That fucker is the
spawn of Satan Never get closer
to it than we are now It’ll rip
you to pieces The Eagle put it
there to guard the lake

MILES
The Eagle has a Swan

THE COLONEL
Mr Starnes Code name The Eagle
Dean of Students Asshole
(beat turns on Miles)
Listen I’m not going to be your
entree to Culver Creek social life

MILES
(thrown by this)
Oh okay sure

THE COLONEL
There are cool kids who go to this
school But they’re all rich
shitrags Weekday Warriors - so
named ‘cause they go home to their
Birmingham mansions every weekend
I don’t like them they don’t like
me So if you want to be cool
Best not to be seen with me

MILES
Being cool has never really been a
priority

THE COLONEL
Good
(checks his watch
resigned)
Time to go

The Colonel starts walking off Miles jumps follows

THE COLONEL
What are you doing

MILES
You said time to go -- so lI --

THE COLONEL
For me Gotta meet the girlfriend

MILES
Oh I look forward to meeting her

THE COLONEL
No you don’t Believe me

The Colonel shudders at the thought of her Marches off
Stops Turns

THE COLONEL
Hey The most important thing
Whatever happens Never rat
Were friends now And I ain’t
friends with no rat

OFF MILES -- nods As the Colonel walks off he smiles
Hes got a friend An angry little friend but a friend

EXT MILESS DORM ROOM -- NIGHT

Miles returns back to his dorm As he nears the corridor he
hears -- an ARGUMENT He slows seeing --

A NAKED GIRL wrapped barely in a sheet CRYING She stands
in front of Alaska’s door Clutching her arm is a man mid
30s handsome and WASPy - THE EAGLE He tries to calm her
Standing next to them is a teenage boy 17 in boxer shorts

A half dozen STUDENTS stand in the hall watching

THE EAGLE
I need you to calm down -- please --

TEENAGE GIRL

weeping)

We’re going to get expelled --
please Mr Starnes don’t send me

home --

TEENAGE BOY
Who told you we were in there -
huh How did you know

THE EAGLE
They don’t call me the Eagle for
nothing Now get dressed and then
tell me where you got the drugs --

TEENAGE BOY
Don’t say a word Marya I wanna
know who ratted on us

THE EAGLE
This isn’t a discussion -- let’s
move back inside --

As the Eagle tries to hustle these two kids indoors --

TEENAGE BOY
(pointing at students in
the hallway)
Was it you Huh Was it
(locks eyes with MILES)
Was it you asshole

Miles moves quickly to his
his room he sees --

ALASKA Or so he thinks

door -- and as he goes to enter

Watching from the other end of the

hall But maybe it was just a shadow

INT MILESS DORM -- NIGHT
Miles is asleep Suddenly

VOICE

TWO MEATY HANDS grab him

Lets go kid Don’t make us kick
your ass Just get up

Miles is completely disoriented From the bunk above

THE COLONEL
Just do it Pudge They do this to

all new kids

Miles nods this seems sensible He rises wearing just
boxers And now he sees THREE FIGURES Two of them grab
him Walking him out The Colonel rolls back over in bed

THE COLONEL
Have a good time Go easy on him
guys

EXT THE LAKE -- NIGHT
Miles is thrown down HARD onto the gravel BANGS his head

KEVIN
Arms at your side

The other two begin WRAPPING HIM in DUCT TAPE Miles is
mummified And scared

MILES
I get it You’re throwing me in
the lake -- but maybe - the duct
tape isn’t a good idea or -
(getting panicky)
Ow You guys Easy ok

KEVIN gets in Miles’ face He is a kid who clearly loves
grooming his floppy thick head of hair

KEVIN
This is for the Colonel You
shouldnt hang out with that
asshole

MILES
Ok Wait Please I’1l1 drown --

And then a STRIP of DUCT TAPE goes over Miles’ mouth He is
totally trapped Screaming through the tape but to no
avail He kicks wildly -- but they lift him up anyway and
then TOSS HIM into the LAKE

SPLASH

WATER RUSHES up everywhere WE SINK with him Eerie
silence under the water The surface getting further and
further away Terrifying

Panicked - Miles strains against the tape Helpless
Screaming But no one can hear him He’s going to drown

And then Miles’ mummified feet hit the bottom of the lake --
he is able to kick off --

And he surfaces Onto his back Craning backwards he sees
the shore Snorting desperate breaths Spitting
Coughing Begins shimmying a SILVER MERMAID across the
lake

EXT MILESS DORM -- NIGHT

Miles sopping wet duct tape hanging off comes down the
corridor As he nears his door -- he hears CRYING

He follows the sound it’s more like WAILING and as he
nears the end of the corridor he sees --

ALASKA On her knees Back to him Below a pay phone The
phone is off the hook but hangs limply at her side

And she rocks back and forth weeping
ALASKA
It’s all my fault it’s all my
fault
She hugs herself doubling over Sobbing

ALASKA
-all my fault all my fault

Miles watches her Doesn’t know what to say She is
inconsolable He has never seen anyone cry this way Miles
puts a sopping wet hand on Alaskas shoulder --

MILES
Alaska

Suddenly she reels startled furious --

ALASKA
Get off me

Miles backs up Woah

ALASKA
Get the hell away from me
MILES
I just wanted to make sure you’re
okay --
ALASKA
I’m not

(beat cruel)
I see someone went for a swim
Alaska blows past Miles

MILES

No - I was kidnapped and taped -
ALASKA

Don’t care ‘Cause I mind my own

business Maybe you should too

INT MILESS DORM -- MORNING

OFF MILES -- sopping wet

shaken

The Colonel exits the bathroom showered Miles stirs in

bed

Wakes up Exhausted

COLONEL
I tried waiting up for you last
night Get lost on your way home

MILES
Thanks for helping me out

COLONEL
Its a rite of passage Pudge
Happened to me They throw you in
a lake you swim out

MILES
Hard to do with duct tape wrapped
around my body

COLONEL
They taped you You couldve
drowned

MILES
They said it was cause of you Did
you do something to them

COLONEL
I sure as shit am going to now
Pranking is a Culver Creek
tradition But those Weekday
Warriors crossed a line

MILES
Maybe I should just go to the
Eagle Tell him what happened

THE COLONEL
No Don’t rat There’s been too
much of that going around here

MILES
What do you mean

COLONEL
Last night Marya -- Alaska’s
roommate She got kicked out Her
rich asshole boyfriend too Paul
They hit the tri-fecta Sex while
drunk and smoking pot

MILES
That was Alaska’s roommate

The Colonel is going to put his sneakers on Stops Sniffs

COLONEL
Those sonofabitches they pissed

MILES

COLONEL
You wanna smell ‘Cause if there’s
one thing I know -- it’s when I’ve
stepped in another man’s piss
(beat)
Lets go Pudge It’s war

EXT CULVER CREEK -- CLASSROOMS -- MORNING

Miles and the Colonel amidst a sea of PASTEL WEARING POPPED
COLLARED FLOPPY HAIRED preppy kids Both look out of place
amidst the Abercrombie models

THE COLONEL
You see them
(off Miles)
The shitrags who did this to you

MILES
(lost overwhelmed)
I don’t know any of these kids

INT CULVER CREEK -- CLASSROOM -- MORNING

Miles follows the Colonel into their classroom They sit
next to a small Japanese kid TAKUMI 16 The Colonel and
Takumi exchange very serious head nods

TAKUMI
This Pudge

THE COLONEL
One and only

TAKUMT
(extends hand)
Takumi
(to the Colonel)
Heard what happened last night
Revenge is imminent Trust

The Colonel is scribbling something onto his notebook

MILES
Im still not sure what happened -
but I’m open to an explanation -

TAKUMI
You’re a pawn dude Nothing
personal

THE COLONEL
Let’s talk counterinsurgency

The Colonel rips the page out of his notebook A series of
squares matching the formation of desks

THE COLONEL
tf any of ‘em are in this class
put an X where they’re sitting

Students are filing in Miles sees Kevin enter Kevin and
the Colonel lock eyes As Kevin sits Miles marks the box

Next is a pudgier KID in flip flops salmon button down and
khakis Miles marks an X as he sits next to Kevin

TAKUMI
Longwell Chase Kevins
lieutenant

THE COLONEL
Asshole

MILES
Seriously What’s going on

The front door of the class opens and in shuffles the OLDEST
MAN YOU HAVE EVER SEEN DR HYDE He breathes with
difficulty As he slowly moves to the lectern the Colonel
takes back the notebook sits up The attentive student

THE COLONEL
(whispering)
The Old Man only has one lung

Miles believes it As Hyde finally arrives at the lectern
he looks out at the students gathered before him

DR HYDE
My name is Dr Hyde This year
well be studying religious
traditions I will talk You will
listen As some of you have
probably noted I am not as young as
I used to be We haven’t much
time

Suddenly the back door opens It’s Alaska All heads turn

But as Miles turns to watch her enter -- we see Takumi and
the Colonel following her with their eyes as well

A moment as Miles takes in all the boys in the room staring
at Alaska And he realizes they’re all in love with her

OFF MILES -- watching everyone watching her we hear

DR HYDE’S VOICE
We will engage in the most
important pursuit in history The
search for meaning

TIME CUT TO
ALASKA
Doodling in her notebook TULIPS Hyde keeps talking

DR HYDE
How did we come to be and what will
become of us when we are no longer
What are the rules of the game and
how might we best play it

Miles steals a glance to Alaska She’s in her own world
Miles looks away Stares out the window Who is this girl

DR HYDE
Religion is important whether or
not you believe in it In the same
way historical events are important
whether or not you lived through
them

Miles continues to stare out the window When he hears --

DR HYDE
You there --

Miles realizes this is directed towards him Uh-oh

DR HYDE
Your name

MILES
Miles Halter sir

Takumi and the Colonel look down distancing themselves

DR HYDE
Mr Halter I am straining myself
for your edification And yet
youve found something outside that
captures your fancy even more

MILES
No sir -

DR HYDE
Whatever it is you find so
fascinating I’m going to ask you
to pursue it Follow your bliss
Halter

MILES
I’m fine really --

DR HYDE
Tomorrow when you’re ready to take

this class seriously I welcome you
back

Miles reddens Not the getting in trouble type Suddenly a
chair SCRAPES back

Alaska rises Slings her bag over her shoulder

ALASKA
I’m sorry But that’s bullshit
(off everyone’s looks)
You can’t just throw him out of
class You’ve been droning on for
an hour and we’re not allowed to
glance out the window

Miles looks in shock from Alaska to Hyde What is she doing
DR HYDE
You abide by my rules Or you
fail Choice is yours Both of
you leave

Miles stuffs his books into his bag Hurries out of there

INT CULVER CREEK -- HALLWAY -- MORNING
Miles leaves the classroom Closes the door behind him
ALASKA’S VOICE
So do you really memorize last

words

Miles turns Alaska stands waiting

MILES
(nervous)
Yeah
ALASKA
JFK
MILES

Thats obvious

ALASKA
Oh Is it now

MILES
No Those were his last words
Someone said “Mr President you
can’t say Dallas doesn’t love you
and then he said “That’s obvious”
And then he got shot

A beat Alaska considers this Miles considers being
considered And then a sly smile crosses her lips

ALASKA
Wanna smoke

EXT THE SMOKING HOLE -- LATER

Miles and Alaska sit Miles HACKING violently This smoking
thing not for him Alaska takes a long hard draw

ALASKA
I’m sorry about last night I
didn’t realize what they did to
you

MILES
Oh Yeah Is everything ok You
seemed pretty upset

ALASKA
I can be moody
(beat)
(MORE)

ALASKA (contd)

And dont worry about Dr Hyde
He’s an asshole

MILES
I thought he was kind of a genius

ALASKA
The only real geniuses are artists

She reaches into her backpack and pulls out a copy of The
General and the Labyrinth It’s weathered dog eared

ALASKA
ok Mr Famous Last Words I have
one for you

She hands it to him

ALASKA
It’s about Simon Bolivar You know
what his last words were
(off Miles - no clue)
Well Im about to tell you Senor
Parting Remarks

Alaska uses her cigarette to light the next Doesn’t need
the book as she speaks As she does - Miles drinks her in

Her face washed pale by the burning cigarette Her breasts
tight in her tank top Her legs swinging back and forth
beneath the swing Her electric blue toe nails letting her
flip flops dangle

ALASKA

He - that’s Simon Bolivar - was
shaken by the overwhelming
revelation that the headlong race
between his misfortunes and his
dreams was at that moment reaching
the finish line “Damn it” he
sighed

(off Miles’ look)
“How will I ever get out of this

labyrinth”
Miles smiles knows great last words when he hears it
MILES
Wow But What’s the labyrinth

She leans in close to Miles He might die in this moment

ALASKA
That’s the mystery Isn’t it
You’re cute

(MORE)

ALASKA (contd)
(off Miles - he is)
But I didn’t just say that ‘Cause
I love my boyfriend

MILES
tries to be casual)
Yeah you’re not bad either But
I didn’t just say that Cause I
love my girlfriend Oh wait I
don’t have one

Miles laughs Hopes Alaska will too She doesn’t

ALASKA
So what’s the deal Your parents
suck

MILES
What No

ALASKA

Then why are you serving time here

MILES
Oh Well
(trying to be grand)
I come seeking the Great Perhaps
(off Alaska - huh)
Danger Adventure Mystery

ALASKA
You don’t seem like the dangerous
adventurous mysterious type

MILES

That’s why I’m here

(off Alaska)
I know it sounds weird or
whatever but I’1l know it when I
find it Feel it

(self conscious)
It’s hard to explain

ALASKA
Clearly
(she leans in to Miles)
But let me ask you something Miles
Halter You feeling it now

Miles doesn’t know how to respond Alaska laughs Tosses
her cigarette
ALASKA
So I’m looking to end the suffering
and you want something worth
suffering for

MILES
I guess yeah

ALASKA
Then let’s make a deal You get me
out of the labyrinth And Ill
help you find the Great Perhaps

She extends her hand Miles takes it OFF THEIR SHARED
SMILE Miles feels he has found what he was looking for

EXT CULVER CREEK -- WOODS -- NIGHT

Miles and Alaska walk back Cicadas HUM They are
silhouettes in the night Alaska turns to Miles

ALASKA
When youre walking at night do
you ever get creeped out and even
though it’s embarrassing and silly -
you just want to run home

She grabs Miles’ hand
ALASKA

(whispering to him)
Run run run

And she takes off running Miles yanked behind her
run through the darkness Miles trying to keep up

As they

She cuts left through some brush as Miles tries to follow

he STUMBLES and when he straightens up --

Alaska is gone Vanished OFF MILES -- realizing he may

never be able to keep up with her

INT MILESS DORM -- NIGHT

Miles enters The SHOWER RUNNING The bathroom door open

shirt and tie He holds a carton of milk

MILES
Is everything ok

THE COLONEL
No I’m supposed to go out with
Sara and her parents tonight But

how to iron

Miles shakes his head The Colonel takes another pull off the
milk Gags Offers it to Miles

THE COLONEL
I call it ambrosia Drink of the
Gods Five parts milk one part
vodka

(as Miles sniffs it)

You can barely smell the vodka
This way the Eagle can’t catch me
unless he takes a sip

Miles takes a sip Nearly pukes

THE COLONEL
Downside is it tastes like sour
milk and rubbing alcohol
(taking it back)
But what the hell Pudge My
girlfriend is a bitch

As he goes to take a sip he hears --

VOICE (0S)
What did you call me

The Colonel freezes Stuffs Miles with the carton of milk
Jumps up His Colonel exterior actually showing fear

INT MILESS DORM -- CONTINUOUS

The Colonel and Miles re-enter the dorm room to see SARA
Shes pretty but fiery And she doesn’t look pleased

THE COLONEL
Sara this is my roommate Pudge

MILES
(extends his hand)
Miles

SARA
Can’t you at least press your
shirt

THE COLONEL
I did my best We don’t all have
our maids do our ironing

SARA
Chip - that chip on your shoulder

THE COLONEL

SARA

THE COLONEL
No Fuckit

SARA

Sara slams the DOOR Some of Miles’ books fall to the floor

THE COLONEL
AHHHHHHHH

MILES
So that’s Sara She seemed nice

A beat Then there is a phone RINGING from outside

THE COLONEL
You mind getting that

EXT MILESS DORM -- NIGHT

Miles follows the ringing a few doors down to the payphone
where he saw Alaska Doodles adorn the wall around the
phone Tulips like the ones Alaska drew Miles answers

MILES
Hello

SARA’S VOICE
Can you get Chip for me

MILES
Uh Sara Yeah Hold on

Miles turns But the Colonel is already standing there He
takes the phone

THE COLONEL

And they both see Sara step out at the end of the corridor
Cell phone in hand

THE COLONEL
Yeah

The Colonel hangs up Looks at Miles Shrugs

We hear the voice of DR HYDE over this

DR HYDE (0S)
While you were looking out the
window the other day You missed
the chance to explore the Buddhist
belief in being present for your
daily life Of being truly
present

The back door opens A pretty girl LARA 16 climbs out

DR HYDE (0S)
Be present in this class And
then when it’s over Be present
out in the world

Miles gets in the car Lara sits on top of him Apologetic

Alaska FLOORS it Lara gets thrown back against Miles He
wraps his arms around her Lara smiles As Alaska swerves
and weaves Miles tightens his arms around Lara

DR HYDE (0S)
Everything ends Mr Halter Might

connect with Alaska’s - she looks away

INT CAFETERIA -- NIGHT

Takumi and the Colonel watch closely as Miles takes a bite
out of a giant fried burrito

TAKUMI
God there’s nothing like watching
aman eat his first bufriedo

THE COLONEL
(marvelling at it)
A fried burrito So simple and
yet so delicious
(yells out)
You’re a culinary genius Maureen

MAUREEN the heavyset cook grunts from behind the counter
And then they hear --

ALASKA
The only geniuses are artists
Have you read Mellville

She sits down between them Eating off Takumi’s plate

THE COLONEL
You would like him Big white
whale as metaphor for everything
You live for pretentious metaphors

ALASKA
(unfazed)
So Pudge We found you a
girlfriend

Miles stops mid-bite Surprised

ALASKA
You know that girl who sat on your
lap yesterday Lara She liked
you You thought she was quietly
discussing pre-calc but she was
really talking about having sex
with you

THE COLONEL
She has great breasts

ALASKA
Do not objectify women’s bodies

THE COLONEL
Sorry Perky breasts

ALASKA
That‘s not any better

THE COLONEL
Sure it is Great is a judgement
on a woman’s body Perky is merely
an observation They are perky

ALASKA

Jake - my boyfriend - is going to
be in Birmingham this weekend
Were going on a triple date
Triple and a half since Takumi will

OFF MILES -- shit
INT ALASKA’S DORM -- NIGHT
Alaska stands over an ironing board Miles watches

ALASKA
Now normally I would’ve been
offended that you’d assume I could
iron A direct reflection of the
patriarchal paradigm

MILES
What’s the patriarchal paradigm

ALASKA
Where should I begin How men only
see women as objects - or how ina
post-feminist world women allow
themselves to be --

And then a voice from the door --

VOICE
Aw don’t get her started on that

Alaska looks up and Miles looks over to see JAKE

ALASKA
Jakey

Miles

She immediately stops what she’s doing and runs into his
arms He has long floppy hair and the faux ruggedness of a
catalogue model He is the anti-Miles

Alaska jumps into his arms Wraps her legs around him She
kisses him passionately Miles wants to look away but can’t

This kiss seems to go on forever After a while they part

ALASKA
This is Pudge

JAKE
(smiles big handshake)
I heard a lot ‘bout ya I hope
your date works out for tonight
‘cause I wouldn’t want you stealin’
Alaska out from under me

Miles forces the most unnatural laugh

ALASKA
(to Jake)
God you are so adorable

And they go back to kissing again

ALASKA
I’m sorry I just can’t seem to stop
kissing my boyfriend

As the making out builds Miles rises - heads for the door -
takes his shirt

Then anyway Alaska went ballistic
on Sara Screamed at her Said
she violated the sacred covenant
between women How will stabbing
one another in the back help women

rise above patriarchal oppression --

her usual bullshit And then Jake
started defending Alaska - and I
said don’t worry about Sara she
just likes bullying people And
then Sara asked me why I never
stand up for her and somewhere in
there I may have called her a
stupid bitch And then the
waitress told us to leave And we
were standing in the parking lot
And she said “Ive had enough Our
relationship is over”

MILES
Our relationship is over

INT MILESS DORM -- DAY

Miles lays on his bed Reading a book about the Civil War
A knock on the door Takumi

TAKUMI
What are you doing fool

MILES
Just trying to figure out why the
Confederate Generals had better
last words than the Union ones
Ulysees S Grant’s last word was
“Water” Lame right

TAKUMI
Yeah that’s what’s lame here
(off Miles)
Heard about your throw down in the
quad You take another shot to the
dome - you could be brain damaged

MILES
What those guys did and what
they said to her face
TAKUMI
Yeah Well They had their
reasons
(off Miles)

Alaska’s complicated dude Shes
done some shit

MILES
Like what

TAKUMI
Pudge Hmmm Pudge

(beat)
You need a cigarette

EXT THE WOODS -- DAY

Miles follows Takumi off the path - they weave through
brambly bushes and pine trees

TAKUMI
The Smoking Hole might not be safe

MILES
Not safe It’s the safest place to
smoke a cigarette in the known
universe

Takumi sits down in a clearing pulling out cigarettes

TAKUMI
Alaska ratted out Marya So the
Eagle might know about the Smoking
Hole too

MILES
(stunned)
Wait Alaska How do you know

TAKUMI
For one thing I figured it out
And for another - Alaska told me
She tells me things Part of being
sexually non-threatening to her
Consider it an honor if she hasn’t
opened up to you

MILES
But why would she rat

TAKUMI
The end of school last year - she
tried to sneak off campus to visit
Jake The Eagle caught her -
bottle of wine in the car She was
fucked So the Eagle brought her
to his house and said Next year
tell me everything you know or pack
up and go home and don’t come back

MILES

So then the first day of school
TAKUMI

Alaska did what she had to

(beat)
She was smart to rat on one of her
friends That’s why the Colonel is
so sure it was a Weekday Warrior
and vice versa

MILES
The Colonel doesn’t know

TAKUMI
No And he can’t He’ll go crazy
The Colonel takes all this honor
and loyalty shit pretty seriously
if you haven’t noticed

MILES
Ive noticed
(realizing)
That day she got herself thrown out
of class with me -- she did it to

prove she was loyal

TAKUMI

Listen Pudge I don’t know what
kind of prank the Colonel and
Alaska are going to come up with to
end this But I’m sure we‘ll both
be involved

(beat)
I’m telling you all this so you can

door He breathes deep -- knocks A beat No answer

A moment where Miles wonders has he been had Is she
gone He knocks again Worried now

And then - the door opens Alaska grins at him

ALASKA
School all to ourselves

MUSIC UP MONTAGE OF

- Alaska leads Miles into various DORM ROOMS climbing in
through windows She’s much more agile than he

- They search through different rooms finding alcohol
beneath mattresses in sock drawers one room has a bottle
of MAUI WOWIE wine behind a KING JAMES bible
54

- They admire the charcoal nude self portraits of one girl
another room has a psychotic amount of CABBAGE PATCH KIDS -
Miles and Alaska terrified laughing

- Beneath the mattress and bed springs of another room
Alaska pulls out a video “The Bitches of Madison County”
She grins Bingo

The whole thing is fun furtive Miles loosening up
INT SOUTHERN DINER -- DAY

Miles and Alaska in a booth Alaska has Vonnegut’s Cats
Cradle with her Reading passages to him No place he’d
rather be

EXT CULVER CREEK -- WOODS -- DAY

Miles and Alaska skip stones across the river She’s much
better than he is As she laughs trying to help him her
hand guiding him their bodies close

INT MILESS DORM -- LATER

Alaska and Miles sit on the couch PORN playing on the tv
They view it as two film theory majors Laughing

EXT SOCCER FIELD -- NIGHT

Miles and Alaska both lay side by side under the stars
Drunk Passing the bottle of MAUI WOWIE wine they stole The
sound of bullfrogs and the distant hum of the highway
They’re close

Alaska slides her hand onto MILESS leg He puts the wine
bottle down -- his chest and hers touching it

Her index finger makes slow lazy circles that creep towards
the inside of his thigh

Miles flushed from the wine and the proximity of their
bodies wants to say something declare his love for her

MILES
Alaska

Sensing Miles’s tone Alaska puts her finger to his lips

ALASKA
Shh don’t ruin it this

Miles nods And they just lie there

INT ALASKAS ROOM -- DAY

Alaska sits in the middle of the floor She holds a candle
upside down dripping the wax onto a huge candle Looks more
like a technicolor volcano

Miles sits opposite her A crate of other candles between
them She lights his candle -- he lets it drip as well

ALASKA
Night falls fasttoday is past

MILES
I’ve heard that before

ALASKA
Poem Edna St Vincent Millay
You read that

MILES
I read her biography Didn’t have
her last words in it All I
remember is she had a lot of sex
ALASKA
I know She’s my hero

(beat)
Does it seem odd to you that you
enjoy biographies of great writers
a lot more than you enjoy their
actual writing

MILES
Mmm nope

Alaska grins at him There is an intimacy to their
friendship now getting their rhythms

MILES
So we trying to make a volcano

ALASKA

This may look like a candle Pudge
But it’s actually a key To our
freedom One day we use this
candle to help burn this school
down These books would make good
kindling

(beat)
Be ironic huh Use books to burn
down a school

MILES
Um ironic or psychotic

ALASKA
It‘s a thin line

And then they hear

THE COLONEL
Alaska’s been talking about burning
this place down since she got her

Okay You wanna know You want me
to tell you everything

ALASKA

(quietly)
I do

MILES
Okay Fine You’re my Great
Perhaps And I don’t even know
what that means which is part of
the point because most of the time
you make no fucking sense with all
your pretentious bullshit

ALASKA
Well thanks Miles

She goes to walk away Miles pursues

MILES
And also I feel lucky whenever
I’m with you And whenever I do
anything that’s good - whenever I
say the funny thing or have a
badass moment - it only means
anything if you get to see it I
feel alive when I’m with you
But also confused And slow And
totally predictable --

ALASKA
Then be unpredictable Miles
MILES
And that’s going to change
anything
ALASKA

Who knows That’s the point of
being unpredictable

MILES
Fine Then
(deep breath)
I love you Alaska When I’m with
you I think we make this great
team And well I love you
A beat Miles has just poured his whole soul out

ALASKA
I know

A beat That’s her response Takes Miles a moment

MILES
You know
(realizing she’s not
saying it back)
Then why’d you make me say it

ALASKA

MILES
Why would I want to say I love you
to some girl who wouldnt say it

ALASKA
But you feel better

MILES

worse Better

ALASKA

MILES

MILES
Why don’t you go run to the Colonel

ALASKA
That’s cause we haven’t gotten to
my worst day yet

Alaska gets up A little unsteady Looks at them Everyone
realizes -- she’s about to share her darkest secret

ALASKA
The day after my mom took me to the
zoo where she liked the monkeys and
I liked the bears - it was a
Friday I came home from school
She gave me a hug and told me to go
do my homework in my room so I
could watch tv later

Alaska takes a long chug The group watches her

ALASKA

I went into my room She sat down
at the kitchen table I guess

long beat)
And then she screamed I ran out
She had fallen over She was lying
on the floor holding her head and
jerking And I freaked out I
should have called 9-1-1 But I
just started crying until finally
she stopped jerking and I thought
she had fallen asleep and that
whatever hurt didn’t hurt anymore
So I just sat there on the floor
with her until my dad got home an

Miles decides to slowly move his hand to hers He lands at
her arm His fingers trace from her elbow to her wrist

LARA

LARA

No eet’s a nice teekle

And then she takes his hand Laces her fingers through his
Squeezes And then she rolls over On top of him

kiss And it’s a real one Lara stops wipes her face

LARA
You slobbered on my nose

MILES

Mostly Drunk

They kiss some more Miles’ hands tighten around her waist
Her legs straddle him

Want to do some homework

INT LARA’S ROOM -- LATER
Miles and Lara lay on her bed Reading Miles has a

biography of CHE GUEVARA in hand Miles flips to the back of
the book Lara sees him do this

LARA
What were they
(off Miles)

His last words

MILES
Captured by the Bolivian army
Guevara said “Shoot coward You
are only going to kill a man”
(with admiration)
South American revolutionaries died
with real flair

LARA

Why do you like last words so much
MILES

I dunno Sometimes just because

they’re funny Like in the Civil
War a general named Sedgwick said
“They couldn’t hit an elephant from
this dis-” and then he got shot
(off Lara smiling)
But a lot of times people die
how they live And so last words
tell me a lot about who people were
and why they became the sort of
people biographies get written
about Does that make sense

LARA
Yeah

A beat Miles was hoping for more

MILES
Just yeah

She nods Goes back to reading It’s one of those moments

when you realize about another person it’s not going to
work out Miles looks at her Kisses her
MILES
I gotta go

bookcase

ALASKA

Alaska’s hand comes around his back Other hand grazes his
cheek Miles stops

MILES
Whats going on here

She looks at him Takes his hand And leads him out of her
room As he passes the Colonel --

but moonlight coming through the window

ON THE BED --
They lay down Alaska on top of him Their legs entinwed
She kisses him hungrily Passionately Miles searches her

eyes -- but she gives nothing back and he can’t resist

MILES

Alaska smiles And as they roll over

LATER --

Alaska lays in Miles arms Post coital They have both
dozed off Alaska stirs She kisses him

climbing up the string Miles and the Colonel take off

gravel

EXT WOODS -- NIGHT

Miles and the Colonel reach the end of the woods Arrive at
a dirt road Where they see Alaska driving towards them

She turns on the headlights -- illuminating the Colonel and
Miles breathless They watch as she drives past them

On ALASKA Trying to be strong She looks out the window as
she passes

MILES Who meets her gaze A moment of understanding
between them Even though Miles understands nothing

She waves thanks And good-bye

And like that the BLUE CITRUS speeds away Kicking up dust
which helps it just vanish into the night

THE COLONEL
What ’s wrong

THE EAGLE
Something terrible has happened

And then he closes the door
TIME CUT --

The Colonel slides on a pair of jeans Miles throws ona
sweatshirt They are casual

THE COLONEL
This happened a few years ago
When Hyde’s wife died I guess

A moment Silence Miles is spinning and then he runs
EXT CULVER CREEK GYM -- MOMENTS LATER

Miles throws open the double doors He dry heaves Sucking
air in and out He can’t cry He can only heave He stands
there Hands on his knees Breathing and then

MILES
She’s not dead

He rises -- smiling Relieved He’s figured it out
INT CULVER CREEK GYM -- MOMENTS LATER

Miles comes back into the gym Grinning Ready to share his
good news But what he sees is unnerving

Takumi stands over Lara His hands on her shoulders Kevin -
with his blue crew cut - has his head between his knees
Another GIRL wails And then he sees --

The Colonel Knees tucked into his chest Lying on his side
on the bleachers The Colonel is SCREAMING Then inhaling
Then SCREAMING

Miles blinks a few times And then he realizes what the

Colonel is screaming “I’m so sorry” Over and over
It’s like a war zone Miles is paralyzed Wants to tell
them -- she’s not dead A hand lands on his shoulder He
turns -- it’s the Eagle

MILES

Why are all these people crying
She’s not dead She does pranks
This is a prank She’s really
great at pranks -

THE EAGLE
No Miles Im sorry

MILES
(doesn’t want to hear it)
She’s really good She could pull
this off

THE EAGLE
Im sorry

A beat Miles trying to process this

MILES
What happened

THE EAGLE
Somebody was setting off
firecrackers in the woods

Miles shuts his eyes this is a gut punch

THE EAGLE

I went out after them And I guess
she drove off campus She was on I-
65 - just south of downtown A
truck had jackknifed Police cars
were there She hit one of them
without even swerving

(beat)
She mustve been very intoxicated
Police said they smelled alcohol

MILES
(now the tears come)
How how do you know

THE EAGLE
I saw her I talked to the police

MILES
You saw her
(off the Eagle’s nod)
How did she look

THE EAGLE
She looked like Alaska

MILES
But I mean was she messed up

THE EAGLE
She had some blood coming out of
her nose But just a bit
(beat)
She was dead Miles

MILES
Oh I see Thank you sir

And with that Miles sits down on the floor Just sits there
Numbly staring at all these other students dealing with what
Miles has just accepted

Alaska is dead
ONE WORD FILLS THE SCREEN

INT MILES HALTER’S HOUSE -- DAY
Mrs Halters answers the phone
MRS HALTER

her At this phone saying the very same

INT MILESS DORM -- NIGHT

A PATHFINDER rolls through the Alabaman countryside
INT PATHFINDER -- MOVING -- CONTINUOUS

Miles in a suit sits in the backseat Staring out the
window Takumi drives The Colonel rides shotgun Beside
Miles is Lara She looks to him but he’s distant

TAKUMI
It just doesn’t make sense even
if she was drunk - who’s too drunk
to swerve out of the way of a
truck

LARA
Who saw her before she died

THE COLONEL
Miles and I uh did

TAKUMI
And what were you guys doing

THE COLONEL
Just hanging out drinking
nothing really

LARA
But no one saw her right before she
left

Miles just stares out the window The Colonel turns around
THE COLONEL
You guys can’t rat Pudge - it’s
ok if I tell them

Miles shrugs Sure
99

THE COLONEL
We were hanging out And then
we all went to bed And then
Alaska came pounding on our door
Screaming She needed to leave

TAKUMI
Why

THE COLONEL
She didn’t say we created a
diversion so she could escape -

LARA
You lit the firecrackers

THE COLONEL
No ratting Lara But yeah

MILES
(quietly to himself)
We let her go

The Colonel looks back from his seat the unsaid thing
between them

THE COLONEL
(not quite convincing)
We did not

Lara realizing the Colonel doesn’t quite believe it chimes
in as well

LARA
You deedn’t You deedn’t know what
would happen She wanted to go

TAKUMI
But why Why was she crying
Where was she going

LARA
Maybe to see Jake Maybe they had
a fight

TAKUMI

She couldve been going to break up
with him Or sleep with him --
knowing Alaska -

MILES
(finally explodes)
Who cares Who cares why she died
On purpose By accident
(MORE)

MILES (contd)
It doesnt matter Are any of you
going to figure out something

thats going to make her less
dead

Looks all around quiet Miles stares back out the window
EXT VINE STATION FUNERAL HOME -- DAY

Miles follows the group towards an A-frame single story
chapel Dusty parking lot As they’re heading in - the
Colonel stops Miles

THE COLONEL
Hey man What was that about in
the car

MILES
I dunno sorry Ive just been
going over it and over it in my
head That night and

THE COLONEL

And what - you think you’re the
reason she’s dead That after you
banged her she realized sex was
ruined for her forever That she
might as well kill herself

(leans in)
Get over yourself Miles You
weren’t that important to her
None of us were

The Colonel walks inside Leaves Miles reeling
INT VINE STATION FUNERAL HOME -- CHAPEL -- DAY

Miles stands at the closed coffin He puts his hands on the
wood Knows she’s inside Tears brim his eyes Behind him
are empty folding chairs He hears a voice --

ALASKA’S DAD
She’s not in there She’s with the
Lord

Miles looks over to see a fat man in an ill fitting suit
holding WHITE TULIPS Alaska’s DAD Teary eyed

ALASKA’S DAD
Her momma used to put these in her

hair when she was little So
Alaska put ‘em on her grave every
year Always had to have white
tulips

(MORE)

ALASKAS DAD(contd)

She even brought ‘em to her momma’s
funeral so her momma could take
them with her

(beat)
It was open casket that one and
Alaska told me “Daddy don’t ever
let them see me dead” So that’s
why I got a closed coffin But
it doesn’t matter either way
‘Cause she’s not in there

(beat)
Shes with the Lord

And he stands next to Miles Lays the white tulips on top of
the coffin OFF OF THE FLOWERS

DISSOLVE TO

LATER
The chapel more filled with students the Minister
delivering his sermon Miles sits watching

Sees JAKE Sitting alone across the aisle The Eagle is
there Sara the Colonel’s ex Even Maureen - who wipes a
tear from her eye

Lara crying reaches for Miles’ hand He moves it away
Doesn’t want to be touched to comfort her She’s stung
Takumi clocks all this

Miles just stares straight ahead Over this we hear

DR HYDES VOICE
How will we ever get out of this
labyrinth of suffering

INT CULVER CREEK -- DR HYDE’S CLASSROOM -- LATER

In class Those same words scrawled behind Dr Hyde on the
chalkboard He holds a blue book in his hand

DR HYDE
When I asked for your final - what
is the most important question
facing people -- that was Alaska’s
question

Miles Takumi and the Colonel are side by side Miles looks
to her seat The seat where she first defended him Empty

DR HYDE
Im going to leave this question up
for the rest of the semester
(MORE)
DR HYDE(contd)

Because everybody who has ever lost
their way in life has asked that

same question And at some point

we all look up and realize - were
lost

(sits conversational)
So tell me how y’all doing
One girl -- HOLLY MOSER -- raises her hand Dr
DR HYDE

Yes Holly Something you want to
share

HOLLY MOSER

I was at the Waffle House for
breakfast and all the lights
went out except for like the
lights over my booth which started
like flashing off and on on and
off

(beat)
And I realized it was Alaska She
was trying to talk to me in Morse
code But I don’t know Morse code
But she probably didn’t know
that

Hyde nods

The Colonel raises his hand Hyde nods towards him

THE COLONEL
I think this demonstrates the grave
injustice of the universe Alaska
Young dies but this girl gets to
live

HOLLY MOSER
(completely offended)
Excuse me Everybody grieves in
their own way -

THE COLONEL
And yours is the dumb bitch way

Holly Moser is aghast The bell RINGS Hyde shakes his

head Too old for this shit

DR HYDE
Take it outside please
(beat)
Mr Halter A word

On Miles -- as the others file out what did he do

INT DR HYDE’S CLASSROOM -- A FEW MOMENTS LATER

Hyde and Miles both stare out the window Miles not sure why

he’s here or even if Hyde remembers he told him to stay
MILES
Dr Hyde sir You wanted to talk
to me
DR HYDE

Your question for the final Mr
Halter has no answer

MILES
I gave an answer I mean tried to -

DR HYDE
No Halter I mean it has no
answer Where we go when we die
Where Alaska is right now We
don’t know
(beat )
You gonna be ok with that

MILES
I guess I don’t have a choice

DR HYDE
There is a Zen saying Mr Halter
‘Everything that comes together

falls apart” That chair Me
probably before the chair You
(beat)

Buddha said that suffering was
caused by desire When you stop
wishing things won’t fall apart
you stop suffering when they do
But that’s no way to live Is it

MILES
No it’s not

DR HYDE
She made you suffer Because she
made you feel alive And now
you have to go on living

Miles feels the weight of this He has to go on living
INT CULVER CREEK -- DINING HALL -- LATER

Maureen slops a bufriedo down on Miles’s plate As he’s
crossing to Takumi -- he sees --

So Lara how’s she doing with
all the grief and sadness

MILES
I haven’t really talked to her

TAKUMI

with one dead side

MILES
Takumi

TAKUMI
Pudge When you’re old and gray
and your grandchildren are sitting
on your knee and look up and say
“Grandpappy who gave you your
first blow job” You really want
to tell them it was some girl you
spent the rest of high school
ignoring

MILES
Very eloquently put Takumi

TAKUMI

of the junior class

MILES
Heres your speech

MAXX
(looks it over smiles)
Wish Id thought of this in high
school

INT CULVER CREEK -- GYM -- LATER

Miles the Colonel and Maxx enter The gym is full
Eagle is behind the podium The Colonel stops Miles

THE COLONEL
Your third and final bad-ass

moment She would’ve loved this

MILES
We haven’t pulled it off yet

THE COLONEL
I’m gonna go make sure Takumi is
set

AT THE PODIUM -- where the Eagle stands

THE EAGLE

asS we take one afternoon a year

to benefit from the wisdom of

voices outside the school Today

our Junior Class speaker is Dr
William Morse professor of
psychology at the University of
Central Florida A widely
respected scholar

buff

The

Maxx seated next to Miles nods Likes the sound of that
Miles bites his lip nervous

THE EAGLE
He is here today to talk about
teenagers and sexuality A topic
I’m sure you’ll find interesting
Please help me welcome Dr Morse to
the podium

A round of applause Maxx rises Walks to the podium
Miles and Lara exchange a look across the bleachers

MAXX
Thank you Mr Starnes I’m here
today to talk with you about the
fascinating study of human
sexuality My research is in the
field of sexual linguistics The
way young people speak about one
another’s bodies says a great deal
about our society For example
boys are much more likely to
objectify girls’ bodies than the
other way around

A few bored students shift in their seats dullsville

MAXX
Boys will say amongst themselves
that so-and-so has a nice rack
while girls will more likely say a
boy is cute This has the effect
of turning girls into mere objects

And then Lara rises in her seat --

LARA
Youre so hot I weesh you’d shut
up and take off your clothes

The students all laugh The teachers are stunned

MAXX
Now what we have here is a very
interesting case study A female
objectifying me - a male

LARA
Shut up and take it off

Maxx looks down - shyly - shuffles his papers

MAXX
Well it is certainly important to
subvert the patriarchal paradigm
So alright then
(shouting)
This one is for Alaska Young

We see TAKUMI - in the AV BOOTH above the bleachers Gives
the nod

And then the bass of “MILKSHAKE” (or some such song) kicks
in Maxx grabs the leg of his pants - and the lapel of his
jacket - and tears them off Velcro

Maxx is revealed to be wearing a black leather thong

As he begins to dance - quivering his pec muscles - shaking
his ass - and teachers begin to freak out -- MILES rises in
his seat

MILES
This one is for Alaska Young

And Miles pulls off his shirt Yanks off his pants In his
boxers He begins to do something approximating dancing

KEVIN - he of the Weekday Warriors - rises as well

KEVIN
For Alaska Young

He is wearing a thong and bow-tie He begins to dance
And then LONGWELL - rips off his clothes -

LONGWELL CHASE
For Alaska

And before The Eagle knows whats happened - half the student
body - the male half - are all in their skivvies catching
on joining in

Dancing shaking it grinding As the GIRLS stand and
applaud Cheering wildly

A true celebration of Alaska
EXT CULVER CREEK -- GYM -- LATER

Miles dressed and Lara bust out of the gym Amidst
laughter Hi-fiving with other students

And then Miles turns and sees the Eagle following Miles
braces himself

THE EAGLE

Mr Halter A word Now I know
you planned that And don’t ever
do anything like that again

(beat smiles)
But Lord -- subverting the
patriarchal paradigm It’s like
she wrote the speech

The Eagle walks off Lara and Miles hug They got away with
it

LARA
You were veery sexy

MILES
I felt sexy

They laugh as Takumi races up Grinning

TAKUMI
Dude It was genius So tight
MILES
What id the Colonel think
TAKUMI
How do I know
MILES
He said he was going to check on
you -
TAKUMI

No - and I was looking forward to
seeing him in his tightie whities

LARA
You think he got scared

TAKUMI

The Colonel Of a prank Never

And then it hits Miles like a ton of bricks -- oh shit

MILES

The pre-prank
TAKUMI

What
MILES

We were the pre-prank
112

And Miles starts running running as hard as he’s ever run
INT ALASKA’S ROOM -- LATER

Stacks of books ENGULFED in FLAME The Colonel - eyes wet
with tears - stands amidst a growing FIRE Alaska’s candles
burning around him He takes books - lighting them on the
candles - and tossing them around the room

Miles charges into the room The Colonel turns

MILES
What are you doing

THE COLONEL
This is what she wanted what she
always wanted

As the Colonel goes for another book - The General and the
Labyrinth Miles grabs it Grabs the Colonel

MILES
She didn’t want this She was
talking shit C’mon --

THE COLONEL
You weren’t the only one who loved
her You weren’t the only one

MILES
I know --

Miles suddenly sees FLAMES go from Alaska’s throw rug onto
the bottom of the curtains As they begin BURNING

THE COLONEL
And if she loved you so much - why
did she leave you that night And
if you loved her - why’d you let
her go Huh I was drunk What
was your excuse

The Colonel is in Miles’s face now Miles is trying to
reason with the Colonel but also realizes this place is
going up in flames fast Smoke filling the room

MILES
I don’t know why - and I wish I
could undo it - but I can’t -

THE COLONEL
Goddammit How did this happen
How could she be so stupid She
never thought anything through

MILES
We shouldve stopped her -

THE COLONEL
Yeah I know I am keenly aware we
should have stopped her But we
shouldnt have had to You had to
watch her like a three year old
You do one thing wrong and she
dies

MILES
She wanted out And if wed
stopped her that night she wouldve
found another way I know it’s
hard But we have to let her go

The Colonel starts crying realizing what he’s done
Miles is coughing smoke burning his eyes

THE COLONEL
I just wish I could’ve said
goodbye

And then Miles realizes -

MILES
We can We still can

EXT MILESS DORM -- MOMENTS LATER

Miles and the Colonel run out Students are gathered around
the dorm Faculty as well PLUMES of smoke billowing out of
Alaska’s window FIRE ALARM wails

Miles steers the Colonel towards Takumi and Lara In the
melee no one notices them --

LARA
What happened

TAKUMI
You alright

MILES
We gotta go

EXT HIGHWAYINT TAKUMIS PATHFINDER (MOVING) -- MAGIC HOUR

Takumi drives Miles in shotgun The Colonel and Lara in
the back Driving in silence

THE COLONEL
I’m in so much trouble

Another long beat of silence

TAKUMI
I have a confession
(Miles looks at her)
I saw her that night

MILES
What - when

TAKUMI
While you guys were lighting the
firecrackers I saw her going to

her car
MILES
Did you talk to her Did she tell
you --
TAKUMI
(nods)
After she left your room the pay
phone rang it was Jake She was
talking to him and she sees her
white tulip doodled on the wall --
and she realizes It’s January
10th
Miles doesn’t get it But Lara sits upright -- realizing --
LARA

Omigod January 9th 1998 Alaska
liked the bears Her mom liked the
monkeys She told us Barn Night

THE COLONEL
(remembering)
Her mom died the next day

MILES
(the final piece)
She missed the anniversary She
was driving to the grave

TAKUMI
She was so sad I didn’t realize
what was going on and that she
was gonna drive

(beat)
I let her go too

MILES
It’s okay

TAKUMI
I loved her

LARA
We all did

THE COLONEL
(sits up leans forward)
This is it

They look onto the highway the sun setting look
straight ahead The sign for I-65 the scene of the crime
Takumi accelerates And we INTERCUT WITH

THE IMAGES FROM THE BEGINNING

The highway at night the Jackknifed truck The Blue
Citrus bearing down on them

MILESS VOICE
I came here looking for a Great
Perhaps For real friends and a
more than minor life

Miles staring out the window Takumi accelerates faster
ALASKA Behind the wheel Drunk Crying Focused

THE JACKKNIFED TRUCK -- the POLICE OFFICERS realizing This
car isn’t stopping

MILESS VOICE
Before that my only company were
the last words of the already dead

LARA THE COLONEL TAKUMI MILES All focused
ALASKA -- wiping tears from her eyes -- tulips on the seat

MILESS VOICE
Like William McKinley the third
American President to be
assassinated He lived for several
days after he was shot But
towards the end his wife started
crying and screaming “I want to go
too I want to go too”

MILES -- closes his eyes gritting his teeth

MILESS VOICE
And with his last measure of
strength McKinley turned to her and
spoke his last words “We are all
going”

As the BLUE CITRUS smashes into the POLICE CAR - begins its
spectacular collision --

MILESS VOICE
Alaska found her own way out of the
labyrinth And she left me to find
mine to find my Great Perhaps

The PATHFINDER roars through the SPOT of the ACCIDENT --
The BLUE CITRUS spins and flies and lands not moving
MILESS VOICE

What‘ll happen next I’m not sure
My search is just beginning

ON THE PATHFINDER -- on the side of the road Parked The
four kids climb out Tiny bits of glass like diamonds
crunch beneath their shoes Remains from the accident

The Colonel looks at Miles and grabs him hugging him
crying A beat then Takumi and Lara join As the four

kids hold each other

THE COLONEL
We must look so lame

Their tears turn to laughter the laughter of being alive
As we PULL UP on the four kids and the Alabama countryside --

MILESS VOICE
I’1l never know Alaska Young’s last
words But her last words to me
were “To Be Continued” And she
was right
(beat)
To be continued

FADE OUT

THE END
