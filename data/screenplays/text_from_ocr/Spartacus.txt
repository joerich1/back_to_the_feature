at the moment of their own choosing instead of like animala and

alaves as they have had to live Gracchus ccumissions Batiatus

to kidnap Varinia and deliver her to him Crassus and his guests

are puzzled by the Gladiators subsission to death seemingly at a
pre-arranged moment Antoninus disregards previous instructions

and tries desperately tokill Spartacus in order to be crucified

in his place Crassus goes to Spartacus ip adairation for his leader
ship and offers his hand Spartacus refuses preferring his fate

Gracchus is somewhat flustered when Batiatus delivers
Varinia to him with the baby though it has nothing to do with
his plan to send her back to her own Germanic tribe and remove
her forever from his arch rival Crassus He charges Batiatus
with her safe delivery before he leaves the country with the for-
tune he is being paid to accomplish this Gracchus quietly retires
to his bath to commit suicide before Crassus arrives after watching
the crucifixion with Caesar and party Batiatus approaches the
guaria and asks permission for the victims wife o speak to hin

bodies glisten with sweat which runs in rivulets down the scar-
troughs that cover their backs and buttocks They work barefoot

INT SALON - PALACE OF CRASS US - GLABRUS - DAY 204

This set can be as opulent as we desire -- or as simple
Crassus lived in the style of a great prince so at the very
least there should be a profusion of marble and gilt and
statuary A section of one side of’ the salon gives onto a
columned courtyard in which a fountain sends up crystal spray
Glabrus looking stern and very martial is pacing back and forth
before this open section of the room ramrod-stiff hands
clasped behind him the very picture of a hero He snaps his
turns like a guardsman measures his steps like a Beefeater
He is absorbed in thoughts of military glory stunned by the
measure of his own greatness

ANOTHER ANGLE - TOWARD SALON ENTRANCE - CRASSUS 205

He APPEARS in the doorway advances a few steps into the room

There he stops his eyes narrowed in speculation as he ob-
serves the stern posture of his protege A faint smile of
contempt touches his lips

CRASSUS
Are you on guard duty

Glabrus startled whirls then advances eagerly to his patron
GLABRUS
My dear Crassus Congratulate me

Or better still let us congratulate
each other

this brilliant affair

But I only take six cohorts The
rest of the garrison remains

provinces and kingdoms They are plainly dressed and wear
no make-up One or two are on the plump side They are ex-

their lot than most Roman household slaves As they go about
their work of serving the food the occasional glances they
east toward their master give one a feeling that they are in-
terested in him that they like to serve him and the glances
he gives them never leering nor lascivious tell us that he
keeps an eve on their work and that he is fond of them all
The feeling is that of a well-run and contented harem

Batiatus unshaven and clad in a tunic that is both soiled

and worn sits across from Gracchus the very image of misery
self-pity and dignity brought low He is extremely hungry
and Gracchus who eats more moderately continually thrusts
more food upon him Batiatus a muined man is desperately

-eager to agree with everything his host says for in this

crisis of his life he sees the friendship and patronage of
Gracchus to be his only hope for salvation

say so

overpainted nymphs the widow of

The lofty tree-ringed redoubt teems with activity Carpen-
ters repair wagons setting up rude structures butchers

slaughter animals and fowl prepare them for cooking there

is a central food depot and ovens with women baking bread
spits with halves of beeves roasting above them The variety
of trades is infinite Most importantly we see the community

of male slaves receiving training exactly like that which was
received by the gladiators at Capua et more severe The

Capua machines are in use trainees carry the log beams they
ehin with the weight of rocks they work with the swords---yet
everything has a quicker tempo than at Capua everything has a
greater air of determination because of course it is voluntary
In far fog teams of men scale the rocky sides of the escarpment
crawling up like flies then leaping down incredible distances

FULL WIDE ANGLE SHOT - THE BATTLEFIELD 319

Utter silence A nightmare landscapeof dead animals dead
men dead women thousands upon thousands of them extending
as far as the eye can see in this dim light -- the field of
death silent lost breathless Although historians differ
on the number of slave and Roman dead at the Battle of the
Silarus River it seems clear that between fifty and a hundred
thousand lay on the battlefield It is a field of death ex-
tending as far as the CAMERAS eye can penetrate

Amidst the awesome litter of war we observe smashed baggage-
wagons tattered remnants of tents shattered arms and snields
The arms and legs of dead horses mules men women children
convulsively up-thrust like columns of cacti against the low
horizon impart a grotesque sense of unreality It seems that
no breathing thing can possibly exist in this land of death
nor hear amidst this silence Abandoned by the world lost and
forever forgotten frozen in the positions at which death found
them the vanquished have at last achieved their dream of
freedom and of peace

In the immediate foreground a slave soldier sits erect his
head bowed forward as if in prayer The shifting balance inside
his congealing body causes him abruptly to topple over sidewise
with a shocking THUMP At this moment our CAMERA begins to
TRUCK FORWARD We see the body of David the Jew transfixed

by ai spear through his chest CAMERA MOVES FASTER -- then more
and more swiftly giving us the impression of passing upstream
through a swift-flowing river of corpses

SOUND of a GROUP walking os CAMERA PAUSES seems almost to
listen then swiftly SWIVELS TO

shocked eyes behold

MED CLOSE SHOT - BODIES OF SLAVE BOY AND SLAVE GIRL 322

This is the couple whose first night of love we saw in the
Slave encampment after the break-out whom we saw married lest
night They are now in the same position against the earth in
which we saw them in the slave encampment They have both
been skewered by the same pilum Their position against the
earths bed in not one to suggest an embrace consciously
achieved The posture of their bodies does suggest however
the desire of each to shield the other from harm The boys
face is eternally frozen in a grimace of exertion and hatred
The girlits white face glowing in the morning sun suggests 2
different emotion Her forehead is knotted in a frown as if
the sharp pain of death has surprised her yet upon her lips
there still lingers the memory of a smile as if she had known
happiness in life and still remembers it

CLOSE ON CRASSUS 323

staring down at the dead lovers In beg we see officers
exchanging puzzled glances They perceive nothing extraordinary
in the sight that compels their generals most painful attention
Crassus however senses in this dead couple a menace a power
a threat that suddenly makes his victory taste like ashes

pale linen and serving plates heaped with delicacies
Candles float in a reflecting pool and from somewhere in the
blue twilight of the garden beyond a lute TINKLES languor-
ously

Varinia ENTERS

She stands tall as a princess her face utterly composed sub-
mitting herself to his inspection She wears an exquisitely
flowing embroidered cotton stola caught up at the waist with
a belt which is tied in front with an ornamental bow The
only decor on the stola is the gold braid that emphasizes its
perpendicular lines Over her shoulders she wears a pale
yellow shawl which she now pulls somewhat closely about her
body as if to spare it the glance of Crassus Her face has
been made up according to Roman fashion of the time base
powder cheek and lip rouge black carbon shading beneath her
eyes beaded lashes arched brows She wears a golden tiara
in her hair glistening with rubies Sapphire earrings set
off her lobes Her wrists and ankles are circled by bracelets
matching the collar in design and stones On the little
finger of each hand a ring of clustered diamonds has been
placed Her sandais are of gold

‘Crassus after a long inspection of her beauty inclines his

head

Orassus peers at Antoninus thoughtfully paying no heed to
Spartacus at all We must remember that this SCENE is the
culmination of Crassus personal problem and of his defeat
his doubts his fears They began on the battlefield when

he saw love unto death and feared it and ordered the cruci-
fixions they increased when he endeavored to have the help-
less hopeless prisoners betray Spartacus to him and they
unenimously refused less than hour ago in his final scene
with Varinia he has perceived that no power on earth can make
her yield to him as a woman --- only as a slave a mers living
body which he happens to own but can never really possess
Now restless filled with forebodings and the most searching
interest hs has come outside the gates to seek to enlighten
the mystery of why slaves behave as the Spartacists have
behaved by confronting a slave who ran away from his own
househoidto join the rebellion Quiet restrained urgently
attentive and somehow saddened by all that has happened he
still seeks his anawers

Crassus glances at the body of Anteninus looks in Spartacus
face and turns aside He starts off leaving Spartacus x
staring after him still holding the murdered body of Antoninus
Suddenly however he turns back

CRASSUS
What do you think Spartacus would
say if he knew that the woman
Varinia and her child now live in
my household -- as my slaves

The look of pure horror of utter agony and anguish that
suffusés Spartacus face tells Crassus that which until
now he could not be certain of

We do not see any crosses from this ANGLE The gate is closed
Just outside the gates which have of course a guard detail
early-comers to Rome have assembled waiting for the gates to
open and the commerce of the new day to begin The whole mood i
of the scene and the attitudes of those who wait should be
one of placidity of patient waiting inactivity A teamster ‘
his wagon loaded high with squashes arrives before the gates
as we come into the SHOT Already there are half a dozen
slaves in charge of their master a small merchant They have
laid aside their burdens and are sitting on the ground beside
them resting A farmer dozes in the seat of his ox-cart and
the ox dozes too An elderly rich man seated in his sedan
chair which has been lowered to the ground by its slave-bearers
(who squat beside it on their haunches) kills the time by ti
peeling and eating a banana

Baggage slaves stir resume their loads Slave-bearers lift

swift visual search each person and vehicle Rome is still
