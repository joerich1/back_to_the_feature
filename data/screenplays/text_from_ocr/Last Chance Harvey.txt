Sound of a piano being played Sparse but beautiful

FADE IN

INT RECORDING ROOM - DAY

HARVEY SHINE mid-60s sits at a piano in a scruffy
recording room tinkering We hold on his slightly sad
intense gaze Just then a shaft of crude light illuminates
him accompanied by a knocking sound From behind a studio
window JOHNNIE a young rocker type in his 20s beckons
Harvey closes the piano lid

INT STUDIO - DAY

Johnnie unpacking his lunch and turning on various buttons
sits at a mixing desk In front of him are 2 large TV
monitors Harvey joins him

HARVEY
Put my score up first

JOHNNIE
They dont want to hear it Harvey

HARVEY
know but I want to hear it Put
it up
JOHNNIE

m backed up already Harvey
HARVEY
(interrupting)
Johnnie you were the one that was
late Just put it up

Johnnie reluctantly presses various buttons

A ‘cheesy commercial for a washing detergent plays It is
accompanied by a jolly classical score Harvey looks on
forlornly at his work As it comes to an end with a

flourish
Harvey lowers his head Beat Johnnie glances at him
JOHNNIE
Listen Harvey Marvin wants me to
present my ideas while your away
Harvey looks up confused
HARVEY
Huh

JOHNNIE

Look Im not doing myself any
favours here Harvey But Id
watch your back

We hold on Harveys tired pensive face

INT STUDIO CAR PARK QUEENS - DAY

Harvey hurriedly exits the studio catching up with a man
walking to his car

HARVEY

HARVEY

MARVIN
“There in person Harvey nobody

HARVEY
I have to stand behind my music

MARVIN
Theyre demos - Theyre already
pressed No one needs to be there
Theyre not looking for you

(beatsighs)
Harvey you havent booked a top

line in 8 months

HARVEY

You got me doing triangle chimes

the now extinguished seat-belt light He looks a little hot
Reaching up to turn on the air he knocks his tray -

his drink into his lap

HARVEY

An attractive middle-aged woman seated next to him looks
over

HARVEY (CONTD)
(to a passing Stewardess)
Miss Im sorry Ive spilt my
drink

STEWARDESS

HARVEY
(to his neighbour)
Whys it always me

The woman perhaps wary of the length of the flight smiles
noncommittally The Stewardess returns

STEWARDESS

HARVEY
Thanks And could I get another

STEWARDESS
A whiskey wasnt it

HARVEY
Yes ‘Jamesons no ice

The Stewardess heads off Harvey mops himself up He places
the small mass of wet towels on his tray and sighs Glancing
out the window he then turns to the woman

A holiday

The woman looks over

response)

interrupts

WOMAN
Im really sorry but I have a
meeting in the morning and I must

HARVEY
No Of course Im sorry

WOMAN

HARVEY

The woman covers herself in a blanket and turns out her
light turning herself away from Harvey

We hold on Harvey from a distance spotlit in a sea of
darkness
