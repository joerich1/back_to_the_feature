BLACK BART Title on screen reads

THE LOVE THEME FROM BLACK BART SUNG BY MEL
BROOKS AS TONY BENNETT AND FRANKIE LAINE

We HEAR the faint SOUNDS of clanking and voices As CAMERA
GETS CLOSER we begin to make out shapes of men hard at work
CAMERA CONTINUES TO MOVE IN

Through the heat shimmer we are now able to distinguish that
this is a railroad work gang made up of Blacks Chinese and
Irish immigrant laborers They are hard at work laying
track westward under the watchful gaze of cruel overseers

CREDITS END
LYLE

the assistant foreman walks into frame He is obviously
dissatisfied He is flanked by two cruel overseers He
takes out a pocket watch glances at it and puts it back

GANG OF BLACKS CUT TO

They are sweating profusely They look at each other Our
hero BLACK BART shuffles forward He is a handsome wiry
black man in his late 20s His appearance suggests that
he is somewhat ahead of his time He takes off his hat
mops his brow in good old darkie fashion and then turns to
his fellow workers and nods They hum a chord

BART
(segues into up-tempo
Sinatra-style rendition of)
I GET NO KICK FROM CHAMPAGNE
MERE ALCOHOL DOESNT THRILL ME AT ALL
SO TELL ME WHY SHOULD IT BE TRUE
THAT I GET A KICK OUT OF You

Barts singing is beautifully backed up in Pied Piper
fashion by his co-workers

flooded with rivulets of thought
cascading in a waterfall of creative
alternatives
