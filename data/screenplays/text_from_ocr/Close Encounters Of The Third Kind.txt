CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND

PRE-CREDITS
1 EXT SITE NEITHER NIGIIT NOR DAY

A f£og-inshrouded knoll looms up from nowhere Its outlines
are hazy An orangish glow hangs on the horizon

The wind blows the fog passes yet nothing becomes clearer
Is this a dream a memory a lost world or one yet to be
ound

Somewhere in the far reaches of space music is playing The
notes drift through space collide collude and pass on

) The mood is ominous something is going to happen here

The music stretches forward as we plunge into the outer reaches
of space
Here we drift among worlds yet unseen by man Meteors flow past
supernovas explode and planets whirl endlessly about unknown
stars

3 INT LABORATORY DAY The sereen gocs to white A tiny red dot appears then clongates
and loops into a horseshoe formation
into
The white dissolves the the pale shaved skin of a mans chest
and the razor-thin red incision completes its horseshoe shape
co Two drops of conzealed blood ooze out of the incision and are
™ quickly absorbed by a mintature blue surgical sponge
aey
i A stainless steel clamp pulls back the thin horseshoe flap of

flesh and anether clamp guided by a surgically gloved hand
inserts a thin elreular sensing devices under the skin The
flap of skin is replaced over the sensor °

ao

We are in a sterile white laboratory somewhere in the present
Soft red and blue lights pulsate against banks of stainless
steel machinery

PAUL VANOWEN grimacing slightly looks down at the incision
in his lower left breast Two white-coated doctors LOU
HEKMAN and HARU MIKO bend toward his chest examining and
suturing the incision VanOwen seated on a long laboratory
table wears only grey pin-striped wool trousers

James Paul VanOwen age 55 has the studied look of a man in
complete control of his life The worn lines across his forehead
are matched by the streaks of grey hair which stretch from his
temples to the back of his head His expression is laconic it
reveals neither emotion nor attitude He eitherfully approves
of what is now being done to him or he is a stoicist beyond
compare

Having implanted the sensor in VanOwens chest the doctors
proceed to test it

A pulsating red oscilloscope--beep beep beep--monitors the
newly implanted sensor Next te the oscillescope 2 spectregraphic

notches vibrates in the dormant position

Lou Hekman selects several strips of metal from a nearby table
and systematically passes them in front of the implanted sensor
Copper steel gold platinum

The oscilloscope and spectrograph register different values for
each metal strip The TECHNICIAN monitoring the electrographs
looks up and nods He is satisfied

Hekman returns to the surgical work table selects another sensor
(a square thermocouple) and walks back to the operating table
Naru Mike has begun scrubbing and preping a shaved area on
VanOwens upper left breast
Paul VanOwen braces himself for the nexe incision Hekman poises
his scapel

EXT TOM KIESELS FRONT YARD MORNING sit

Fade in YTOMKIFESEL a 45 year-old physics teacher at
Clarenceville Community High School stands in his Crone yard
on a pleasant Saturday morning We is weariny Sears work pants
and a worn blue flannel shirt with the sleeves rolled up

A superimposed title reads

Clarenceville Indiana
September 1960
A faded lawnchair and charcoal burner stand on the front porch
of Kiescls middle-class red brick ranch house An oversizsd
1959 Dodee with gigantic Fins rests in the driveway wé Directly
behind Kiesel waits an old Reo lawnmower

Kiesel speaks to the camera He is relating an event which
happened the previous night for an unseen interrogator His
monologue begins calmly enough but as he gets into the story
he begins to relive the emotions he felt at the time curiosity
uneasiness then fear His expressions and gestures guide him
as he relives these terrifying moments

KIESEL
My wife and I were driving heme from the PTA jinen
meeting about 1000 laste night In fact I ee
it was 1000 cause the news had just come on the
radio I was very tense and was trying to relax
Wess teyiug Lo Tlsci the Dond issue for che new
Science Building and being head of the department
I had to justify the expense As I said it was
pitch dark and I was trying to let my mind go blaak
Janice and I were coming back on Three Mile Road
She sensed it first We had just passed ili and
she said Look at that light There was a sort of
dim glow to our right and rear She said That
must be one of those UFOs I was just about cto tell
her it must be a helicopter when it pulled alongside
of us and I could see it wasnt no helicopter at all
It was gliding very smoothly about 500 yards to cur
right About 50 yards above’ the trees That would
be north There was ne doubting it cause it was the
only light in the sky At first I figured it must
be an illusion I pulled the car to the shoulder
and cut the engine to get a better look Then I
‘ heard it--nothing at all You know if youre in the
house alone at nighe and everything is still there
still are the sounds of the living But this chin
was there and there werent even che sounds of the
living It was am erie perfeee quict Like nothing
at all Janice started to get seared The lights
of the car went out and IT started to get secured Low
but I didnt wane Janice co know I got out of the
ear and the first thing chat hit we was the hear
there was heat everyvhere Like Lo was in the middle
of the desert--warm dry air TL started teward the
object le had stepped and was hovering directly in
(coNnT)

KIESEL

(cont)
front of me about 100 yards above the ground
I was a pilot in the War and saw a lot and thought
I wasnt scared of anything but let me tell you
I was scared then Ive seen just about every
kind of aircraft there is and this was like nothin
I had ever seen It started to move slowly toward
me still not making a sound It looked like two
huge pot covers placed atop each otherlike this
It was made out of a dull grey metallic substance
like pewter or platinum Right on top there was a
vaised portion like a hub you know and where the
two pot covers met there was a thin row not a row
exactly more like a continuous band of blue light
It slowly kept coming closer and I wanted to run
but my legs wouldnt move I didnt know what wes
going to happen Later Janice said she tried to
start the car but it wouldnt turn over The object
was blotting out the whole sky then it suddeni
shot up vertically at-a fantastic speed In couple
seconds ic was gone It headed northeast i follower
its azimuth with my hand and it covered at Least
thirty degrees in two seconds which if I know
anything would put it at at least 5000 miles per
hour Listen Ive flewn a dozen different planes
and studied astronomy and I know that wasnt no kins
of plane or star or meteor It was something else
officers but I dont know what Lve never seen

anything like it before Im a good Christian man °-a

I dont lie

Kiesel stares forlornly at the camera a moment waiting for an
answer which doesnt come

TIME CULT two Clrenceville police officers HALEY LAWSON and
JOHN GOUDA wave goodbye to Kiesel and walk across the lawn to
their patrol car Kiesel watches them get in

INSIDE THE PATROL CAR Lawson starts the engine as Gouda thunps
his note pad against the dashboard in nervous frustration

storefront Republicen campaign headquarters Underneath the
phete are crblozensd the words Integsicy and Noenescty

Passing a nearby telephone pole we see a flyer bearing an
unflattering picture of John F Kennedy It reads “Can a
Catholic be President

bicycles A transistor radio hung over one of their handle
bars plays Itsy Bitsy Teenie Weenie Yellow Polka Dot Bikini

All the animals were just whoopin and a brayin

ESTES
(angrier)

In an effort to calm down Estes Lawson gets out his pad and
pencil and says officiously

LAWSON

a circus town The main street is jammed with cars and
curiosity-seekers They strain their necks out the windows
windows gawking at the pedestrians who gawk right back

All the Fringies has descended upon Cjarenceville the curious
the sick and the UFOphiles One enterprising man has parked
his battered old Plymouth UFOMOBILE at the curb and is hawking

all manners of outlandish UFO Literature (I Made Love to a Space

Creature’) from his open trunk

Further down the street a congregation of the infirm patiently
awaits its extraterrestial savior One woman is on erutches
another man in a wheelchair and so on

Giant hand-lettered signs have been tacked up here and there

A stack of papers files and newspapers lies on the beat between
them On top is a folded copy of the Sunday Chicago Tribune

It carries a 3-column photo of the Clarenceville UFO (an ili-
defined glowing object) and the headline Indiana Town Gets
UFO Fever The story carries Claude Ames- byline

The rear of the station wagon is stacked with suitcases boxes
£iles forms and electrenic equipment

VanOwen and Higby sit comfortably beside each other Their
relationship is a professional one they have worked together
for some time and feel no particular need to make conversation
Higby finally breaks the silence

HIGBY
Sorry vwesred to pull you away from your
family like this

VANOWEN
Ah nothing lost anyway Just another Sunday

VANOWEN
Wed like to borrow if for a couple hours
if we may
(calling to Higby)
Bill
HIGBY -

(catching up)

Yes

VANOWEN
Find a mechanic to go over Toms car from top
to bottom See if there is any possibility of
ignition or engine failure

KIESEL
You do think my car stalled of its own do you

VANOWEN
Ive pot to cheek it out Ttes my job This
is a very good repert Tom one of che mast
lucid Encounters of the First Kind weve had

KT ESEL
18

VANOWEN
Thats just Air Force jargon A Close Encounter
of the First Kind is simply a close range
sighting where a clearly identifiable object is
seen We got a report of a second kind encounter
at Jack Estes farm but there havent been any vali¢
third kinds reported in this series of sightings
A Close Encounter of the Second Kind is where there
is material evidence such as soil depressions burrt
grass and so on If we could proved your car
stalled without mechanical reason it would make
yours an Encounter of the Second Kind

KIESEL
And the third kind

VANOWEN
A Close Encounter of the Third Kind is one in
which some form of extraterrestial life is seen
humanoid or otherwise Very few of these are
credible

Kiesel gestures to the plastic Lag covtaining the serap of metal

° KIESEL
What are you going to do with that —

VANOWEN
We send all the samples on to the Research and
Development Lab They file a report

KIESEL
Could I have it back when theyre finished Id
like to use it in my class

We take a closer look a the scrap of metal it does seem quite
peculiar

VANOWEN
Honestly I forward this stuff and never see it
again But Ill pass along your request Im
sure something can be dona

back of the station wagon with the other equipment Camera
CLOSES on the odd scrap of metal

Papers files and toiletries are all neatly stacked on the
dresser in VanOwens motel room

VanOwen is comfortably slouched in a tacky motel chair with

a telephone receiver wedged into the crook of his neck With
one hand he holds a cigarette and with the other absent-mindedly
works a crossword puzzle as he talks on the phone But most of
all VanOwen seems to be resting his mind he is a man capable
of accomplishing many tasks simultaneously

He scems blithley uninterested in the conversation he is having
his answers are only of the most perfuctory and obligatory nature
Between snatches of conversation VanOwen takes short puffs on
his cigarette He also manages to solve three crosswords before
the conversation is over

recognize those of Tom and Janice Kiesel Jimmy Simpson and his
parents and some teenagers from the malt shop

Tarps blankets and cushions have been placed over the playing
field The spectators have been encouraged to lie on the

field so they can watch the stars as Prof Smith speaks The
older spectators assume seats in the bleachers while the younger
‘and move adventerous ones lie on the playing area

Gouda looks for a seat in the stands while Ames heads toward
the cushions

large glowing blue helium-filled balloon

There is a possibility that a large rare
uniquely-formed plasma passed over this area
last friday night An Air Force pilot reported
a plasma 50 to 100 feet in diameter over Cincinati
and moving west at 2100 hours friday ples

Pious saree Teeter meeeeey)
spheverwererry No one knows exactly why they’ Gecur
no one can predict how they will act A plasma is
a dense mass of highly ionized air Under certain
freak conditions such as thunderstorms oxygen
molecules can loose electrons getrs
poserivesttrerse The resulting chain reaction
produces a compact mass of electrified air The
excess electrons are in turn picked up by dirt
particles salt crystals or even insects causing
them to glow in colors proportional to their
chemical composition

Plasmas of course have long existed in the
familiar form known as ball lighting But in recent
years there has been a marked increase of plasmas
ocurring around newly-develoned high-tension power

have also been known to emit plasmas Scientists

were recently able to create plasmas using amonia and
natural gas--a combination which can be found over
newly fertilized farm lands The Morehead Planitrariua
has developed synthetic plasmas with controlled
electric discharge in gas-filled tubes This for
example is a picture of a plasma artificially induced
by the Atomic Energy Commission

And here is a photo of a naturally occurring plasma
taken from a height of 30000 feet -

And heire is the picture Jinmy Simpson took of the
UFO which appearcd over Clarenceville last friday

« (shows photo)

All three photos look remarkably similiar VanOwen is presenting
his evidence as skillfully as a courtroom lawyer

VANOWEN

The similarities are remarkable Now this is jusc
a hypothesis only one of many IL wish to make no
more of it than to emphasize the fact chat all the
qualities aseribed to fridays UFO can also apply
to a freak plasma such as the one over Cincinaci
they can hover glow in colors ‘travel at great
speeds touch ground burn grass induce static

‘ cause engines to short out

(CON T)

VANOWEN
(cont)
And of course there are other possibilities
I wont even go into the possibility of a nasty
and vicious hoak such as the one which was
perpetrated on the citizens of Clarenceville
last night a hoax which even fooled a reporter
from one of the countrys most prestigious newspapers

Claude Amcs hangs his head in shame VanOwen has the secret
smile of a man who is scoring points and knows it

TIMECUT It is a little later in VanOwens presentation Having
made his case he is now artfully turning the various witnesses
against each other--all in the pursuit of acurate information
Higby watches on silently he has seen this routine work before

VANOWEN
In looking over the reports I was struck by
several discrepensies Tom you reported the
oject glowed blue and made no sound whatsoever

KIESEL
Yes

VANOWEN
And Jack the saucer that landed on your farm
had a large pink dome and made a screechy noise

didnt it
EsiEs
FRCK
Thats right
VANQWEN

Jimmy Simpson said it glowed a dim white and his
excellent photo bears that out Mrs Blakely said
that the object was cigar-shaped and had red port-
holes I dont doubt what anybody has reportad

I just wondered if you might have something more
to add Tom

Paul VanOwen drives across the dark country roads toward
Clarenceville He appears calm and content with himself
A job well done ty

VanOwen drives along for quite some time before he senses
something strange Nothing precise exactly An odd feeling
in the air the sense of someone following him

Feeling heat on the back of his head VanOwen rubs his neck
A florescent glow seems to shine momentarily into the back of
the station wagon but when he turns around to look it is gone

Driving on he feels ‘heat all around him He looks at the
water temperature guage it is rising

There scems to be a faint blue glow alll around the station
wagon VanOwen strains his head out the window to look behind
him but sees nothing He checks the battery gauge it is
discharging rapidly AW

The glow grows warmer VanOwenhis speedometer fall steadily
60-55-50-45 Ieépresses the accelerator to the floor but the
car continues to détclerate 40-35-30 He rechecks the gauges
The water temperature reads hot and the battery is fully discharge

The engine bepgins to sputter VanOwen pumps the accelerator
but the station wagon only sputters more--then conks out lie
slowly guides the dead car onto the shoulder

The car comes to a hale The interior and exterior car lights

suddenly go dark Buc there is still a strange Light solely
flooding the area a blue glow He feels the sweat on his Lace
VanOwen opens lis door and steps outside The moment he does he he

a stranye mechanical plercing sound--the SAUCER SOUND--quiet but
intense

CONTIRUED

He looks up and sees it a huge blusish saucer hovering hundreds
of feets above his head This is the only time during the
sequenee that we see the saucer itsel£ All the other shots
are played against VanOwen his car the road the landscape

In fact the abject VanOwen sees may not be real at all Ic
certainly is real to VanOwen but from the evidence available
we cannot be sure if it is a hallucination or a genuine close
encounter

At first VanOwen seemed curious then upset now fear is setting
in We walks backward down the road

He staggers off the road Suddenly the saucer seems to be
directly above him huge round and bluish He is flooded in
light

Without warning all noise stops There is stillness everywhere
The light slowly dissolves to pink VanOwens eye sockets seem
hollow his cheeks callow

‘ Sweat pours across his face his lips tremble He wants to run

but his body wont oblige he is frozen

Hie eyes epen us big as suucers Fear fills his every pour fe
is seeing something of incredible grandeur--or horror It is no
plasma

His face and body are transformed as if by X-Ray It is an
in-depth X-Ray the like of which has been been seen on this earth
The ray cuts through him layer by layer first we sce his skin
then the red network of blood vessels then the grey network of
the nervous system then his skeletonal structure and finally
nothing but a pale glow--his very soul

He raises his hand before him and sees only a skeletons palm
bathed in red Light

The SAUCER SOURD returns then dissolves into the OUTER SPACE
SOUND VanOwens palm dissolves to the misty view of the SITE

and we are back momentarily where the picture began An orange glow

hovers on the horizon We hear the sound of worlds colliding

intertwined there is also a new sound--the PIHONETICLOOP SOUND--
a repeated pattern of sounds which scams cto make a coherent
sentanee Perhaps something Like ka-fa-roo-pho-lie-ka-fa-roo
(final seleetion of course would be made alter study of possible
phonetic sound Loops)

The Site dissolves inte OUTER SPACE and we are back among unknown
stars planets and galaxies The outer space sound grows grander

INT CHURCH MORNING

The purple-robed church choir take their seats and the organ
music dies out

Rev Schuur takes the pulpit

REV SCHUUR
We would like to thank our choir and Mrs Fite
VanDyk for that very moving rendition of the
old hym When Faith like a River Attendeth
- My Way

Our text this auining cones Crom Pauls
second epistle to the Corinthians Chapter
5 verses 14 through 17

Schuur reads the verses in a ministerial monotone VanOwen
Sharon and Becky all dressed in their Sunday best sit in a
prominent pew Sharon and Becky like the rest of the
congregation are straight-backed and attentive

All except Paul that is VanOwen seems extremely uncomfortable
nervous restless gu Ws prev ecy fas boede

Paul fusses and fidgets through about half of Schuurs reading
then he can take it no more The fuseais burning dangerously low
on his personal time bomb he must escape ar he will explode

VanOwen stands up abruptly turns and walks with long confidence
strides up the aisle and out of the church Parishoners turn
their heads to watch him pass Schuurs delivery hesitates as
his eyes wateh Vandwen

VanOwen walks dawn the steps and stands in the empty NARTHEN
Ne breathes deeply the claustrophobic feeling is gone

Ne looks from side to side becomming suddenly aware of what he
has dene He walks over to the tract rack and seans them
Lluattentively

The choir has begun to sing the soothing sound of distant voices
drifts throurh the varthex VanOwen pieks up his Bears
44

The choir sings an inspiring choral (perhaps “Jerusalem) and
VanOwcen seems more and more carried away by it

VanOwens subconscious mind begins to exert its will over his
conscious The hidden memory begins to emerge

The CHURCH SOUND is transformed in VanOwens ears to a new
sound the CELESTIAL SOUND which in turn is mixed with the OUTER
SPACF SOUND The celestial sound is in fact an orchestrated
mixture of the organ church saucer and outer space sounds

Red and blue nebulae-like mists materialize before his eyes
turning and twisting about like lost worlds

This is but a rudimentary memory VanOwen can only make out
it vaguest outlines The memory grows before his eyes
tantilizes him with its tangibility then evaporates

The blue and red mists blow past leaving only the original
vision of the SITE--erie distant and imposing

VanCwens memory is interructed by Sharons voice He and Sharon

The Game Room is a large wood-pancled Tudor Style relaxation
room in the otherwise crome and steel underground Grief complex
The room is richly decorated with deep pile carpets and leather
chairs and contains a chess table a dart board a2 pool table
a television and rows of books

As the camera slowly pans across the room we find a congenial

assortment of seemingly unrclated activities Haru Miko (his

cigarette tip aglow) silently watches an early Sixties episode

of The Beverly Hillbillies further along Otis Carey and Ken

Tabulis play chess intently beyond them August Kilne and and

Lou Hekman are wbeweey a lacadasical game of pool Behind therm and

white-jacketed FEMALE STAFF MEMBER browes through the book shelves

At the far end of the room Paul VanOwen and Judy Nicholas ene st

geated side by side in high-backed leather chairs weading Paul

wears informal clothes and is deeply involved in a heavy tome -

about radio astromony Judy a good-looking woman about 35 is

reading something less weighty All in all it seems a happy

though highly unusual family

We watch VandOwen suddenly all this intense study gets too much
for hic We drops his back te the floor puts his hands avenr
his neck in a mock-choking manner stands up staggers in a
circle and finally collapses to the carpet as if choked to death

eoLé

Judy looks up momentarily but no one else takes much notice Their
closeted conditions have forced the Grief staff members to be
remarkably tolerate of each others eccentricities

VanOwen finally pulls himself to his feet picks up his book
plops back down in his chair and resumes reading

After a moment Judy turns to him and says

JUDY

Getting a little too much for you Paul

As they pass the chess table we notice that Carey and Tabulis

white corridor is much like the one he just left in this case
however the walls are hung with Andy Warhol silkscreen prints
and the floor is covered by a rich red carpet

This is the dormitory floor The doors bear nameplates and
are liberally spaced They also bear weer like im a collese

under Haru Mikos name someone has written From the folks
that brought you Pearl Harbor)

Paul walks slowly down the corridor He passes Judy Nicholas’
suite and notices her door is open and her light on She is lving

I was hoping someone would come by and talk
to me

VanOwen pours himself a drink from the crystal decanter of
scotch on the coffee table Ue gestures to Judy but she

Oh certainly But its just that it
ahhmakes everything sofinal

JUDY
But you knew that all along

VANOWEN
Yes but it had never hit me quite sobluntly
before She asked me why I did it and I didnc
know what to say

(a beat)
For some strange reason I remembered something
my mother used to tell me as a child She was
a very religious woman and she had pat explanations
for everything She had her own definitions of
heaven and hell For examples she said that hell
was just Like that moment you know that moment
your finger is pricked by a pin the inscant of pain
when the pin first breaks the skin she said hell
was chat Lleeting moment of intense pain stretched
out into infinity Well ehe also had a definition
of heaven Heaven she said was not harps and
folden streets but was che place of all knowledge
where all ouc questions would be answered and where
we would know everything Whenever T asked her a
question she couldnt answer Like How does a

Now that really appealed to me I could

of gold and singing the praises of the Lord
all the time but this idea of knowing all the
answers fascinated me And I didnt realize
how much it fascinated me until several years
ago

Well I guess that was pretty much what I
wanted to say Gece bbtterem Ionian

VanOwen moves as if to stand up but doesnt quite make it out

Do you want to stay

VanOwen locks at her sympathetically

The organ sound mixes with the SAUCER SOUND and they dissolve
into the OUTER SPACE SOUND

The scene dissolves into the misty orangish distant view of THE SIT
As the camera continues to move forward the site dissolves
into OUTER SPACE

We travel through outer space moving swiftly and in a single
direction Ahead of us the constellation Orion draws nearer
in the belt we see the TIFID NEBULA

We approach the Tifid Nebula a pink-and-red mass of expanding
steller clouds which resembles a Georgia OKeef Iris painting
The sounds merge into the CELESTIAL SOUND

The Tifid vagina opens wide and we plunge in

Inside all is DARK dnd we hear the PHONETIC LOOP SOUND ka-fa-
roo-pho-lie-ka-fa-roo

Faces appear At first they appear to be those of strange

space creatures but then we realize they are only distorted
human faces

Or more acurately half faces The half face of Sharon
merges with the half face of Becky merges with the half face
of his mother A hand is raised up before the faces as if
to indicate Go No Further

his tired legs gain strength his sagging arms gesture
expansively his cyes glow like a cats Becomming increasing
‘ absorbed in his own story Ravanski crouches by his old chair
Soon he is adrift in a world of his own

Ravanski speaks--with a East European accent--in lush Victorian

RAVANSK
As was my custom I went to a certain downtown
hotel where I always stay and registered I
tipped the bellboy and stood alone in my simple

room What reason‘had brought me there I did

not know What unseen force pulled me so Suddenly
) coming to a decision I went downstairs crossed
the elegant lobby and wandered into the cocktail
lounge I remembered Miss S--a former student of
mine who must remain nameless--and went into the

phone booth and called her She was delighted

a to hear from me and said she would come over

a immediately She not owning an automobile said
ns it sould tale her an hour to arrive by bus Thon

I knew it was not Miss S I was speaking with at
all The telepathic message the Venusians had
been trying to send me had finally gotten through

This was not to be of course the first trip
I had made to Venus My first voyage was in 1956
but you undoubtably know all about that from my
book Ill autograph a copy if you like

(gestures to Zneif

When the car came to pick me up the driver
of course was not Miss § at all but Rakon the
Venusian I had met in my earlicr voyage We rode

cow in hisblack 4-door Pontiac—sone forty-five minutes
ea through the dark outskirts of town i SOURS oo

Uranantha was my guide On our planet
she would be called Rakons sister but they
haveno families there Uranantha looked very
much like an earth woman except she had silver
eyes and long silver hair She wore a ski-type brown
ee suit and round her wait was wound a orange

elt We made love in front of a great bay window
as our ship journeyed the seemingly short distance
to Venus Meteors drifted eriely by and she told
me all the secrets of life on her planet Venus
came up rapidly on our right and Uranantha suggested
that we go on to Saturn since I had never been
there I gladly agreed

Venus passed quickly by I could see the
yellow clouds that had so entranced me on my first
visit Suddenly we were hit by a shower of
meteorites and the ship shook violently from side
to side Uranantha grabbed my sleove Tren aks
said there was another man on my planet--they de
not call it Earth but Kelos--that I must meet and
she mentioned your name She said you were a friend
of space people everywhere Then she sang me the
song I was to sing to you It had a light melody but
no rhyme--Venusian songs do not rhyme She seng
like this

(sings in a lilting voice)
Melodically we coursed our way
From distant star our path was warped
Everyone danced like leaves in the storm
They hit a plate and made a song

VanOwen suddenly becomes absorbed in Ravanskis song His face
goes pale his jaw drops Ne hears the low piercing SAUCER SuUND

Before Ravanski can finish his song VanOyen completes the
lyrics for him The words come From VanOwen spontanceusly and
without wacning Ite is almost as if someone else is speaking
through his mouth
