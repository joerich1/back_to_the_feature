He shakes both Will and Lynn’s hands

TATE (CONTD)
I’m really sorry for what you’re going
through Especially you Annie

LYNN
Thank you

TATE
I’m sure it’s been a long day Annie but
I have a couple of questions You feel up
to it

LYNN
She’s been through so much already

TATE
I know Mrs Cameron but the sooner we
can start the investigation the better

ANNIE
It’s okay I’m fine

TATE
(to Will and Lynn)
If you wouldn’t mind excusing us for a
second

WILL
What Enough okay This is my daughter
I think I have a right to know--

GAIL
Actually Mr Cameron the laws on
victim’s rights are very specific-—-

ANNIE
No It’s okay They can stay

GAIL
Only if you want them to Annie

Will stares helplessly at Annie

ANNIE

They can stay

TATE

Tate pulls out a note pad

TATE
Annie when was the last time you had
contact with
(checks his notes)
Charlie was it

ANNIE
This morning

Lynn looks at Annie shocked

WILL
What You’re still talking to him

TATE
Mr Cameron it’s very important you
understand this Right now Annie is the
victim of a crime And you and your wife
are actually witnesses Normally we
interview everybody separately so as not
to contaminate anybody’s testimony
That make sense

WILL
Yes I get it

TATE
Good So if you wouldn’t mind giving me a
second alone with Annie Then I’11 come
by your home this evening and you and I
can sit down and talk Fair enough

Tate looks over at Annie reluctant speak in front of her

WILL (CONT’D)
Annie would you please go down and see
if Mom needs any help

Annie walks out As soon as she’s gone

TATE
DNA is part of the rape kit and right
now there’s a nationwide backlog
(off Will’s confusion)
In Illinois alone we got six thousand
kits in freezers waiting to be processed

WILL
What

TATE
A lot of these guys are repeat offenders
too that could be off the streets if we
just ran the kits

WILL
How is that possible

TATE
After 911 they moved half my unit to
work terrorism That leaves about 5 of us
to cover all of Illinois

Take pulls a sleek laptop from his briefcase turns it on

TATE
Were almost done Just one more thing
Id like Annie to try to make contact

think something’s up Probably move on to
somebody else

ANNIE
Somebody else What do you mean
TATE
I wasn’t -- it’s my experience that’s

TATE

Will paces shakes his head

WILL
She didn’t yell for help She didn’t
scream or tell him to stop

TATE
Just because it wasn’t forcible doesn’t
mean this wasn’t a rape

WILL
I taught her better She should have
known better--

TATE
That’s not fair This guy’s twenty years
older than she is He groomed her for
weeks just to get her into that motel
She’s armed with what Eighth-grade
biology and the expectation that the
world is a decent place

My parents said I did

GAIL
Well it’s not up to them I’m here for
you I want this to be a place where you
feel comfortable and safe

ANNIE
I just don’t get why this is such a big
deal There are girls at school who had
sex with half the football team I lose
my virginity and my parents make a
federal case out of it Literally

Gail smiles

GAIL
I bet they’re just as concerned about who
you lost your virginity to as they are
that you lost it at all

Annie shrugs her shoulders

ANNIE
Thing is I bet my dad would really like
him If they had you know met before
But now there’s no way

GAIL
Forget your parents for a second How do
you feel about the fact that he’s so much
older than you

ANNIE

I don’t know I mean at first I thought
he was 16 okay And then suddenly he’s
20 and I’m like “what” And then we kept
talking and I was like what’s the big
deal He was sweet and really funny and
had great advice which by the way
worked I made the team because of him

GAIL
Does it bother you that he lied about his
age so many times

ANNIE
I get it I mean I’m not dumb He didn’t
want to get into trouble

GAIL
I’m not judging in anyway Annie but
there are reasons why he’s in trouble
Why girls your age and men his aren’t
supposed to be together

ANNIE
Don’t you believe that when two people
are in love nothing else matters

GAIL
I think no matter how you slice it love
is really complicated

ANNIE
Whatever He loves me I know he does
He’s dying to call me or email me but
he knows it’s not safe thanks to my
parents and the FBI I just

Annie stops

A filthy bed piles of papers rotting food and several computers
among a jungle of cords and printers Lights flicker flies buzz

A MAN (40s heavy) in a wife-beater sits at one of the computers

Bottles of urine -- he’s too lazy to get up -- surround him
On the computer Photographs of YOUNG GIRLS -- kiddie porn
The man hears a sound -- snaps his head to the right -- where he

finds Will standing in front of him A GUN in his hand Instinct
kicks in -- the man lunges for a BASEBALL BAT by the desk

Will KICKS it away and in the same motion lifts his arm over his
head and swings down IMPACT -- the butt of the gun landing flush
on the bridge of the man’s nose

Blood sprays and the man drops to the ground Will’s on top of him
in a blink Again with the butt of the gun -- three swift fluid
swings -- all landing on the side of the man’s head

The man is dazed He blinks rapidly trying to focus on Will
Wipes the blood out of his eyes -- just as the MUZZLE of Will’s
gun enters his mouth

Will pulls the hammer back -- it locks ready to fire Wraps his
finger around the trigger Begins to squeeze as we

TATE
It’s not that easy The DNA profile was
in the database But it’s still a John
Doe We don’t know whom it belongs to

WILL
So how do you I don’t understand
TATE
There were other cases -- three of them --

where rapes were reported Each time we
were able to recover genetic material
from either the crime scene or the
victim It’s the same DNA profile we
just don’t know whose it is

The family’s in shock Annie in denial

So he’s done this before
ANNIE
You know he had other girlfriends right
He told me that

TATE
These weren’t girlfriends Annie They
were minors who reported rapes

ANNIE
Can DNA be wrong I mean are you sure

Lynn rubs Annie’s back in support

TATE

The odds of these four samples not coming
from the same person it’s in the
hundreds of millions It’s the same guy

Tate pulls out three pictures

TATE (CONTD)

Look we don’t usually do this -- we’re
very careful with victim information But
were hoping that there’s some connection
between you all Maybe you went to camp
together shop at the same store who
knows I can’t tell you their names but
would you mind looking at some pictures

LYNN
I don’t think that’s a good idea

burned out I just got reassigned to the
terrorism task force

lawyer who was raping his three-year-old
nephew You know I’m about to have a kid
of my own

So what does this mean What’s going to
happen to Annie

I wanted to find out how Annie’s doing

GAIL
You know I can’t discuss her treatment
Mr Cameron

WILL
I’m sorry but that still doesn’t make
sense to me She’s my daughter a minor
If she needed an appendectomy you’d need
my signature for surgery right

GAIL
Therapy is different

WILL
This whole thing None of this makes
sense to me I’m really starting to

He shifts restless Visibly distraught

GAIL
What’s going on Did something happen

WILL
I just-- I can’t stop thinking about it
I’m driving or-- whatever in the
office In a meeting I picture him on
top of my daughter or behind herand
before I know it I’m The other night
this dream I’ve got him I’m on top of
him And I’m beating him to death His
face caving in I’m punching him and
punching him blood’s spraying my face
and I can actually taste it the blood
And I wake up and find I’ve completely
chewed up the inside of my cheek I’m
tasting my own blood

GAIL
Is some of your anxiety due to him still
being out there

WILL
I guess

GAIL
Let’s say they caught the guy And he was
in prison How would you feel

WILL
Good Relieved Angry

GAIL
Why angry
Will sighs

WILL
‘Cause I’d still want to rip his fucking
head off But now I couldn’t

GAIL
What else are you angry about

frustrated Thinks

WILL
I’m angry I didn’t know what was going
on That she lied to me That I didn’t
know the extent of herintimacy with
him That I couldn’t--

He stops himself

GAIL
What stop it We can’t always control
what happens to us Or the ones we love
What happens when Annie’s away at
college

WILL
What are you-- What’s your point

GAIL
People get hurt We can only do so much
to protect our children ourselves
What’s important is that we’re there for
each other when we do fall down To help
pick each other up

Will shifts agitated

WILL
Do you have kids
GAIL
No actually we don’t
WILL
Right
GAIL
