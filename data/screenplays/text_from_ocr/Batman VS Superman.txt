The Commando FIRES his weapon The Bullets BOUNCE of the
Atlantean armor but one PENETRATES the Warriors leg He

Commandos

With LETHAL EFFICIENCY he DISPATCHES the Commandos SLICING
their ARMS and STABBING them THROUGH the LEGS with his
TRIDENT

Warships)

SUPERMAN
The people here are innocent

ORIN
And I will release them and
(gestures to the rig)
destroy this abomination

SUPERMAN

ORIN

Their machines poison my oceans
Ruin the Earth There is nothing of
this world but rot decay and
death

(points Trident at

Superman )
And you would be its champion

SUPERMAN
I would be its protector

ORIN
Why Humans hate what they dont
understand and they can never
understand someone like you

installations all over the planet
This has to stop

On the television TV talk show host CAT GRANT A BUXOM
BLONDE with an ICE WHITE smile hosts a DEBATE between LOIS
LANE and MORGAN EDGE a SLICK YOUNG PR EXECUTIVE

INT WGBS-TV STUDIO -- CONTINUOUS
Cat SMILES at the CAMERA

CAT
Good Evening Im Cat Grant and
joining me tonight on our panel is
Pulitzer Prize winning reporter for
the Daily Planet Lois Lane

LOIS
Glad to be here Cat

INT LIVING ROOM HOUSE KENT FARM -- CONTINUOUS

MARTHA
(impressed)
She looks good on TV

INT WGBS-TV STUDIO -- CONTINUOUS

CAT
And to her left is Morgan Edge PR
executive to Metropolis own
LexCorp The worlds leading
conglomerate and a virtual economy
all by itself Lovely to have you
here

EDGE
Always a pleasure

CAT
So Lois Ill start with you Its
been almost a year since the attack
on Metropolis and in that time you
have been a very vocal proponent in
the media for the being known as
Kal El as an ally to Earth

LOIS
I believe Kal El is being portrayed
unfairly in the global media and as
a witness to what transpired before
and after the events in Metropolis
I have no doubt in my mind that Kal
El can and will aid humanity in
ways that I understand the
population are finding difficult to
accept right now

CAT
Morgan you and LexCorp have a
different view point
EDGE
We share the same view as the
majority of the world in that there
is no evidence that this Superman
isnt a very real threat to the
safety of every single human life
on this planet

LOIS
I disagree Just look at the good
works hes done not just in the US
but around the world in the last
year

EDGE
By good works do you mean breaking
international law and causing
incident after incident Cat just
tonight we are getting reports that
he attacked Russian Military
personnel in Russian waters

INT LIVING ROOM KENT FARM -- CONTINUOUS
Martha looks at Clark

MARTHA
You were in Russia How was it

CLARK
Angry

INT WGBS-TV STUDIO -- CONTINUOUS

EDGE
(to Cat)

The Russian President is furious
As long as we harbor Kal El it
looks like we are condoning his
actions While hes flying around
dishing out his own brand truth and
justice the Russian government is
accusing us of aiding terrorists
But Ms Lane would have you believe
that hes a hero

LOIS
(to Cat)
The United States government
conceded that Kal El not only saved
millions of lives here in
Metropolis but also the entire
planet

EDGE
Yet Ms Lane he couldnt save the
5000 people that lost their lives
right here in our city A death
(MORE )
EDGE (contd)
toll that would have been much
larger had it not been for the
efforts of the citys police and
emergency workers And what part is
Kal El playing in the
reconstruction of the city None
It is LexCorp that is fixing that
damage that he ultimately caused

LOUIS
(dismissive)
This isnt a PR piece for LexCorp
Morgan

EDGE
Just pointing out that your super
friend isnt the only one doing
good works

LOIS

(to Cat)
Kal El possesses so much potential
as an ally of humanity rather than
being labeled an enemy I believe
hes here to help despite what
people like Morgan would have you
believe

MORGAN

(scoffs)
You say hes here to help but what
has he done Lex Luthor has poured
over 5 billion dollars into the
citys infrastructure Giving many
impoverished areas a new lease on
life including rebuilding notorious
slums like Hobs bay

LOIS
And which is still and enclave of
violent criminal organizations
which fall under the protection of
LexCorp and their lawyers

EDGE
There is no evidence of that and
you shouldnt concern yourself with
slanderous rumors

LOIS
It isnt a rumor that you and Lex
where members of the most notorious
gangs ever to come out of Hobs
Bay

EDGE
Its no secret that life didnt
afford Lex and I quite the
opportunities that it did you Ms
Lane

CAT
(interjects)
But look at Lex now

EDGE
Exactly Cat Lex Luthor and LexCorp
are the real heroes Metropolis
needs Not some reckless Alien who
hides his true intentions from the
world

INT LIVING ROOM KENT FARM -- CONTINUOUS

MARTHA
He does not like you

CLARK
(smiles)
Seems like that

INT WGBS-TV STUDIO -- CONTINUOUS
Cat smiles at the camera

CAT
Well thats all we have time for
After the break we will show you
exclusive report from our Russian
Affairs correspondent Angela Chen
Lois thank you for joining us

LOIS

Thank you
CAT

And Morgan Give my regards to Lex
EDGE

Sure thing

INT LIVING ROOM KENT FARM -- CONTINUOUS

MARTHA

I think she held her own

CLARK
She always does

MARTHA
Why havent you brought her around
lately

CLARK
Because you both get way too drunk

MARTHA
(indignant)
Whatever You gonna stay the night

CLARK
Sure I got a doctors appointment
in the morning anyway

MARTHA
Ok well take out the garbage before
you leave

Clark KISSES his Mother on the cheek

CLARK
Sure Mom

INT WGBS-TV STUDIO -- CONTINUOUS

Lois steps off the stage where Edge is having his MICROPHONE
REMOVED

EDGE
Dont feel too bad Lane TV is a
lot different than sitting behind a
laptop This is where I shine

LOIS
If you ever get tired of being
Luthors mouthpiece then maybe you
can pursue a career

EDGE
You know if you keep going after
him like this Lex might start to
take it personal

Lois looks Edge right in the eyes

LOIS
I couldnt prove the details of
Luthors
(emphasises )
âaggressive aquisitions of rival
companies That doesnt mean I
stopped looking

EDGE
Thats usually when you should

LOIS
Usually my sources dont end up
dead

EDGE
Life can be a fragile thing Ms
Lane
(smiles)
Take care

Edge leaves

LOIS
(agitated)
Self important asshole

She removes her CELL PHONE from her pocket and turns it on
She has a TEXT FROM CLARK

GENERAL SWANWICK Head of the UNITED STATES NORTHERN
COMMAND sits to her right along with Silas Stone and to her
left is

AMANDA WALLER a STERN and FOCUSED SENATOR with an
INTIMIDATING PRESENCE

PRESIDENT NELSON
So what are our options

WALLER
Honestly very few The world is
watching our every move on the
Superman We have to take a
definitive action

PRESIDENT NELSON

Which is
WALLER
(forthright)
Engagement
SWANWICK

I must advice against this course
of action Superman has in my
opinion more than proved himself as
an ally

WALLER
(to Swanwick)
Hes proved himself as a liability
(MORE )

WALLER (contd)
(to President)
Russia is pushing for some sort of
action and if we dont act now we
risk looking weak

PRESIDENT NELSON
What do you suggest

She hands her a THICK FILE stamped CADMUS
The President FLIPS through it

PRESIDENT NELSON(CONT)
What am I looking at here

WALLER
Last year we recovered several
items from Metropolis after the
attack Two items in particular An
advanced incubation system and a
body Which Cadmus Cadmus has
managed to successfully duplicate
the Alien DNA

The President looks INTRIGUED Swanwick looks SURPRISED

PRESIDENT NELSON
Which means

WALLER
Which means Maam why worry about a
Superman when we can have our own

SILAS
(to Waller)
You and I both know the results of
Cadmus are inconclusive at best

WALLER
(dismissive)
I have assurances from the head of
the project Professor Sasha Federov
the worlds foremost authority on
genetic engineering that a subject
is ready for field testing

PRESIDENT NELSON
Does STAR Labs have any
alternatives

SILAS
We are researching several courses
of action None of which involve
weaponizing alien technology

WALLER

(to Swanwick)
Courses of action that are leading
to nothing

(to President)
Mrs President the world is
changing I and Im sure STAR
Labs have been monitoring several
occurrences all over the world The
attacks on oil platforms by
terrorists whose technology is
something we have never encountered
before Reports of an entity in
Central City that moves faster than
sound Cadmus can counter these
very real threats All we need is
your signature

The President PONDERS her decision as she reads the file

PRESIDENT NELSON
Why am I only hearing about this
now

WALLER
Up until a few months ago there was
nothing to tell Just research
experimentation no concrete
results

PRESIDENT NELSON
Whos funding this project

WALLER

Several different institutions
SWANWICK

I must advice against this Mrs

President

PRESIDENT NELSON
(to Swanwick)
I had the Russian President on the
phone for over three hours this
morning General Swanwick We need
solution and I believe Ms Waller
has provided us with one

Waller smiles SELF SATISFIED

PRESIDENT NELSON
I cant give you a definitive
answer until after the conference
but as of now
(places the file on her
desk)
You have my support

Thank you Mrs President

game has changed Theres a living
weapon patrolling our skies and
its about time we had our own

GARDNER

HARPER

HARPER
When he was just some brat on the

around her neck to CONCEAL her BRUISES

She reaches out her hand to Wayne

MERCY

Mercy Graves Assistant to Mr

Luthor Its a pleasure
Wayne takes her hand and cracks a smile

WAYNE
The pleasure is all mine

Nice decor

MERCY

A perk for the minions Lex
believes a entertained workforce is
a productive workforce

WAYNE
Nice policy

MERCY
Effective policy

She leads Wayne towards the GLASS ELEVATOR BANKS They step
inside and Mercy presses the TOP FLOOR

The Elevator lifts off
As the lift climbs Wayne observes each floor

Many of the Floors are filled with ROWS and ROWS of COMPUTER
MONITORS each manned by a YOUTHFUL TECH GENIUS

WAYNE
I remember when LexCorp was a
warehouse by the Bay

MERCY
Lexs goal has always been meeting
ones potential He believes LexCorp
is an example to which everyone can
strive to

The Elevator comes to a halt and the doors slide open and
Wayne steps into the SPACIOUS 125th floor PENTHOUSE

The ROOM is HUGE and ROUND bordered BY WINDOWS which offer a
PANORAMIC view of Metropolis A BALCONY jutts out of the
side of the Penthouse

Wayne steps inside and the doors close behind him

Sitting CROSS LEGGED on his desk in front of an ARRAY of
COMPUTER SCREENS is the RICHEST man on the PLANET ALEXANDER
LEX LUTHOR 30 the CEO of LexCorp He is one part TECH
GENIUS one part RUTHLESS business man and two parts

his eyes and a detailed SLEEVE TATTOO of the METROPOLIS
SKYLINE creeps up his right arm

His EYES say it all Behind them BURN the FIRES of
UNPARALLELLED GENIUS A POWERFUL INTELLECT enabling him to
accomplish anything he bends his will toward Within the
boundaries of his mind he is GODLIKE

Wayne observes the IMAGES that captivate the youthful

billionaire THE MAN OF STEEL
LUTHOR
Look at it So sleek So powerful
WAYNE
Hes an impressive specimen
LUTHOR
It Wayne
(shifts around to face
him)

Its an alien And a trespasser and
it doesnt belong on this planet
Perhaps you share my view

WAYNE
Superman isnt the reason for my
being in Metropolis

LUTHOR
Your reason being Metropolis
itself

WAYNE

I cant help but take an interest
in the citys tragic circumstances

LUTHOR
(half smiles)
And profitable circumstances

WAYNE
Neither of us would have gotten to
where we are if we didnt look at
the bottom line

LUTHOR
I got to where I am through hard
work and innovation You by
accident of birth I assure you we
view our bottom lines very
differently

He HOPS of his desk and walks past Wayne to a BAR near the
ELEVATOR In comparison Luthor is much SMALLER that the
POWERFULLY BUILT Gothamite Yet his CONFIDENCE more than
matches Waynes stature

Luthor reaches into the FRIDGE and removes and ENERGY DRINK

LUTHOR (CONT)
(cracks open the can)
Id offer you a drink but I dont
have any gingerale

WAYNE
We both want the same thing Lex To
help Metropolis Our past
differences shouldnt get in the
way of that

LUTHOR
(takes a gulp)
Past differences As I recall you
called me an amoral arrogant brat

WAYNE
Yes on the very same day you
launched your first satellite

Luthor smiles

WAYNE (CON T)
And a cyber attack crippled mine

LUTHOR
(smirks and leans back
against the Bar)
Coincidence Wayne The world is
full of it

WAYNE
Apparently so Took us quite a
while to get it operational again

LUTHOR
I liked that satellite It was
quaint Whatever happened to it

WAYNE
An alien in a black onesie kicked
it out of the sky

LUTHOR
(amused)
Ouch

WAYNE
Im here to help The rebuilding of
Metropolis is my main priority
Pooling our resources would better
serve its citizens Im willing to
let bygones be bygones If you are

LUTHOR

An alien spacecraft blasted a hole
in the city where I was born Im
not about to let a few limp insults
from a trust fund baby overshadow
that

(finishes his drink and

crushes the can)
Do you really think you would have
gotten past the lobby if I was
holding a grudge

WAYNE
Im glad we can put it aside I
dont think either of us relishes
continuing this war for contracts

LUTHOR

(dismissive)
Wayne enterprises is a powerful
company but not enough to challenge
me in my own backyard I am
LexCorp LexCorp is Metropolis
Those contracts are mine But
despite your companys limitations
there are things I can use it for
Itll allow me to focus on more
important matters

Wayne looks back at the monitors

WAYNE
Superman
LUTHOR
(irritated)

Its not a man Its an alien And
by the time the world finally
absorbs that this

(MORE )

LUTHOR (contd)
(gestures out of the
window towards the
ruined sections of
Metropolis)
-- could happen again

Wayne look out on the RUINED and IN REPAIR structures His
face reflects his CONCERN for the City

WAYNE
What would you suggest

LUTHOR
When a dog bites a man we put it
down Because we understand what
its capable of That thing isnt
one of us and doesnt deserve the
understanding that the government
is affording it

WAYNE
You sound like you want to kill
him

LUTHOR
There comes a time when even a god
must die

WAYNE
Youve seen what he It can do

All that power All that strength

LUTHOR
It might be hard for someone like
you born with the silveriest of
spoons to understand I spent my
childhood on the streets I joined
a gang Its survival I didnt
have much of a choice I learned
there that there was always someone
bigger stronger but never smarter
By the time I was 15 that gang
answered to me Strength is nothing
Wayne Resolve is everything

WAYNE
Then why not use that resolve to
find a peaceful solution

LUTHOR
There is no peaceful solution with
an trespasser

WAYNE
How about one that doesnt involve
you going toe to toe with a god

LUTHOR
(amused)
Toe to toe I dont go toe to toe
with anybody You dont become the
general by charging the frontlines
with the rest of the troops

WAYNE
Too smart for that

Luthor raises and eyebrow and smiles

WAYNE
Im glad you reconsidered and
alliance

LUTHOR

Im not usually one to second guess
myself but you dont become a
billionaire at 18 by ignoring the
bigger picture

(walks past Wayne and

returns to his position

on the desk)
Ill have Mercy send some contracts
over Im sure we can find
something for you to do However
minimal

WAYNE
I look forward to it Ill be at my
Metropolis offices

Luthor doesnt reply He just stares at the Computer
screens and the BLUE and RED clad source of his VENDETTA

Wayne turns and walks toward the Elevator

LUTHOR

future of our planet And wed
these words I give you

Kal El

A HUSH goes over the CROWD Superman FLOATS above them and
lands on the stage

MARINES raise their WEAPONS and the TANKS train their
CANNONS on the Kryptonian

Superman takes the Podium and looks out over the Assembly
Lois watches him with CONCERN Jimmy SNAPS pictures

SUPERMAN

(takes a breath)
My name is Kal El I stand in front
of you today as a gesture of peace
I know that my presence here has
changed how the human race
perceives itself As a child I was
sent here from my world Krypton but
Earth has always been my home It
is where I was raised Everything I
know everything I am comes from
here I am one of you

A DIPLOMAT yells from the audience

DIPLOMAT(OS)
(shouts )
You are not one of us

SUPERMAN
I understand your fears But I am
not your enemy

President Nelson stands up

PRESIDENT NELSON
And what are our assurances

SUPERMAN
All I can give you is my word

PRESIDENT NELSON
That just isnt enough If we are
to trust you then we must know you

SUPERMAN
I believe all the world needs to
know is that I am here to help To
protect I offer myself to humanity
freely and without condition

A RUSSIAN DIPLOMAT stands

RUSSIAN DIPLOMAT
(angry)
You attacked Russian Military

SUPERMAN
They were firing on innocent
civilians Russian civilians

RUSSIAN DIPLOMAT
(shouts )
Lies That was an act of war
The conference ERUPTS
The President holds up a FILE

PRESIDENT NELSON
This file contains a list In the
past year you have been involved in
several international incidents
Russia Great Britain China The
list goes on and on You
consistently interfere with world
affairs with no regard to the
consequences or legal ramifications
of your actions

SUPERMAN
I help where I can Im here to
save lives I cant afford to stop
and consider what politicians will
be inconvenienced by my actions

PRESIDENT NELSON
And as noble as your motives may or
may not be You cannot expect us as
a species to simply sit back and
allow you to dictate the course of
our history without our consent
Where is your authority

SUPERMAN
Honestly I have none I am not here
to be a dictator Im here to serve
the people of this planet in any
way I can

PRESIDENT NELSON
And therein lies the problem Who
do you really serve At the end of
the day Kal El you answer to no one
but yourself and that is a
frightening concept

Stewart who sits between Silas and Swanwick leans
the Professor

STEWART
I gotta give it to the lady She
aint scared of no one Man or
alien

Silas nods

PRESIDENT NELSON
I hold in my hand a United Nations
Bill Signed and ratified by every
member state that demands you
(MORE )

toward

PRESIDENT NELSON (contd)
surrender yourself to its
authority If you are truly here to
serve then serve the people of
Earth by abiding by its laws and
institutions

SUPERMAN
That is something I cannot do

PRESIDENT NELSON
Cant or wont

SUPERMAN
I am here to serve all humanity
regardless of their allegiance
What you are asking my to do is
take orders and eventually take
sides

PRESIDENT NELSON
Then I do not see how we can allow
you to enforce your will on our way
of life regardless of your
intentions Youre not leaving us
much in the way of options

The BRITISH PRIME MINISTER stands

BRITISH PRIME MINISTER
You must agree to the UN Bill

The Conference ERUPTS with CHEERS of SUPPORT for the BILL

SUPERMAN
But I will not be a prisoner or a
pawn for government interests and
that at the end of the day is what
the Bill means Its submission to
an authority that I cannot
recognize because it prevents me
from serving all the people of the
world I will pledge myself to
humanity but not to its leaders
Im sorry Mrs President

The Conference YELLS and MURMERS
Wayne sits in silence pondering this turn of events
Waller smiles to herself

SWANWICK

on the planet The President will
sign off on Cadmus This is exactly
what she wanted

The Conference has gone CRITICAL

He reaches behind his CAPE and produces a SILVER GRENADE
He PULLS the PIN and THROWS it
Superman CATCHES the grenade
BOOM -- It EXPLODES engulfing him in a THICK GREEN SMOKE
Superman COUGHS and SPLUTTERS as the SMOKE FILLS HIS LUNGS

and THROWS it back through the window

It EXPLODES bringing the ENTIRE BUILDING down onto Superman
The Man of Steel throws the debris off
Batman ATTACKS again

He throws a PUNCH which Superman CATCHES in his fist and
retaliates with a COUNTER PUNCH which Batman CATCHES

Both Men engage in a TEST of STRENGTH

SPARKS fly from Batmans ARM JOINT as his Armor begins to
FALTER

SUPERMAN (CON T)

Supermans EYES GLOW RED and he EMITS a BLAST of HEAT VISION
which IMPACTS Batmans Chest Plate causing it to melt

Batman releases his GRIP and is sent HURTLING backwards into
another CONSTRUCTION SITE and DISAPPEARS from view

Superman tries to SHAKE the FOG from his VISION He wipes
the BLOOD from his CHIN

With some EFFORT he TAKES OFF

A HIGH TENSILE CORD wraps around Supermans ANKLE and he
STALLS in MID AIR

Beneath him Batman BLOOD DRIPPING from his own mouth SMOKE
rising from his Armor has CONNECTED the other end of the
WIRE to a BULLDOZER which is being DRAGGED SLOWLY ACROSS the
ground

The Dark Knight pulls a POWERFUL TASER from his BELT and
ELECTROCUTES the WIRE

Superman YELLS out in PAIN as the WAVES of ELECTRICITY
COURSE through his body

Batman TOSSES the Taser aside and COILS the WIRE around his
FOREARM and pulls the WEAKENED Man of Steel back to Earth

He SLAMS VIOLENTLY into the ground

Before he can stand Batman is already upon him and WRAPS the
Wire around Supermans NECK and PULLS the Cord TIGHT

BATMAN
(smiles)
There is no one

Superman GASPS for AIR then JUDO THROWS Batman over his

face with a HUMAN SKULL

He RECOILS in HORROR
BATMAN (0OS)

the fallout
Superman takes a LABORED BREATH and raises his FISTS
Batman attacks with a LIGHTNING FAST COMBINATION of PUNCHES
before terminating with a SIDE KICK which sends Superman
backwards through a CRUMBLING WALL

Superman CRASHES out into the STREET

you weak You float there with all
your power but do you even know how

Bold words for a man who prefers
someone elses finger on the

trigger

you surround yourself with people I
can hurt

(he turns to face

Superman )
Like Lois Lane

Supermans face betrays his EMOTION The THREAT has made him
ANGRY

symbol But I can see you for what
