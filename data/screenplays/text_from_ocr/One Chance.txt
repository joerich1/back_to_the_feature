INT ST CATHERINE’S CHURCH - DAY (FLASHBACK)

Shots of the choir Four rows deep First and third
rows leading the song rows two and four following several
bars behind All eyes on the peripatetic CHOIRMASTER

Several rows behind the fourth row Paul stands alone
singing with gale-force might

YOUNG PAUL
O tidings of comfort and joy comfort and
joy O tidings of comfort and joy

Several members of the fourth row wince at the decibel
level as--

INT TRAIGE ROOM THREE - DAY

The gurney is locked into position as the medical team
takes over Yvonne wrings her hands in the doorway

DR THORPE
How long since it occurred

YVONNE
About an bour They said he just
collapsed after his solo

ROLAND
Miracle he hasn’t ruptured our eardrums
from all his hooting and hollering

YVONNE
(elbowing her husband)
He’s a passionate singer

INT ST CATHERINE’S CHURCH - DAY (FLASHBACK)
Where Paul sways as he solos with eyes fervently shut

hands clenched voice like a wind throughout the
cathedral
YOUNG PAUL
Fear not then said the angel let nothing
you affright This day is born a Savoir
of a pure Virgin bright To free all
those who trust in Him--

JOY
INT EMERGENCY HALLWAY - DAY

As Paul is wheeled into surgery Young Dr Thorpe now in

DR THORPE

ear Not to worry we’ll have him right
as rain in no time

YVONNE

DR THORPE

Of course Well not with anyone still

breathing
(realizes the faux pas)
I’m still new but rest assured live or
dead the bits are all the same once you
start digging around inside
(now they’re freaked)
Cafe’s just down the hall

He heads into surgery As the doors swing shut--
ROLAND
(arm around his wife)
Hell be just fine
MATCH CUT TO
EXT POTTS HOUSE - DAY (SEVERAL DAYS LATER)

A two-story row house adjoined on either side and
identical to the sixty other homes on the block
The door slams behind Paul who stands on the landing
carrying his school bag

He pats the large bandage mummifying his repaired ear
then looks both ways before descending the steps to the
sidewalk

He checks his surroundings again before venturing out the
gate and turning down the road

MATTHEW
There he is Get ‘im

Paul runs as a flock of screaming YOUNG BOYS crosses the
road hot on his heels Their screams blend into the
continuing choral medley as we return to

INT ST CATHERINE’S CHURCH - DAY

Where the same Welsh choir-faces several years older now
continue the song with undiminished fervor over--

EXT PORT TALBOT WALES - DAY

Establishing shots of this gray industrial steel-town
huddled on the edge of the Celtic Sea

From above the city we see Paul a lone figure running
down the center of a roada moment later the group of
boys appears in close pursuit until they catch him and
start punching

INT ST CATHERINE’S CHURCH - DAY

Reveal that the rows behind the choir are empty And
yet Paul’s voice rises above the rest though it sounds
impossibly far away

EXT PORT TALBOT STREET - DAY

Paul tears around a corner the lead pursuers close behind

him He’s slightly older now closer to thirteen or
fourteen with a few extra pounds

He cuts across a busy intersection narrowly avoiding a
lorry which momentarily cuts off his pursuers

EXT BUSY STREET - DAY

Paul weaves through pedestrians He’s aged again nearing
eighteen and puffing even harder with the extra weight

The boys chasing him appear older larger and there are
more of them than before and they’re gaining on him
EXT ALLEY - DAY

Paul turns down the empty alley losing his schoolbag to
the clutching hand of the closest pursuer

Near the alley’s end Paul veers wide to the left in
anticipation then cuts right barely fitting his belly
through a narrow pedestrian opening

The lead boys miss the turn smacking into the alley wall
and crumple

INT ST CATHERINE’S CHURCH - DAY

Paul’s hidden voice is somewhat louder now as the CAMERA
looks down on the choir from above

EXT OPEN STREET - DAY
Paul looks back to see his lead has widened He smiles
then turns forward an instant too late to avoid the newly
constructed scaffolding on the sidewalk
He opens his mouth to scream

CUT TO
EXT OPEN STREET - DAY
Where Paul lies on the ground mouth bleeding bullies
standing over him laughing MATTHEW the toughest of the
lot leans forward and allows a stream of spit to dribble
onto Paul’s cheek where it mixes with the blood from his
ruined mouth

INT PRINCESS OF WALES HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM - DAY

As Paul is brought in on another gurney where he’s met by
a slightly aged Dr Thorpe

DR THORPE
What’ve we got

CHOIR
Among your friends and kindred that live
both far and near

INT ST CATHERINE’S CHURCH - DAY
CAMERA PULLS OUT of the shattered mouth of PAUL now in

his twenties singing with reckless fervor through the
shards of two badly broken front teeth
CAMERA CONTINUES pulling back to reveal he is alone in
the upper choir loft a good twenty feet above the rest of
the choir

CHOIR (VO)
That god send you a happy new year happy
new year That god send you a happy new
year

INT ST CATHERINE’S CHURCH - DAY
The Choirmaster’s fists clench shut silencing the choir

CHOIRMASTER
That’s very nice indeed

FADE TO BLACK
INT CAR PHONE WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

Walls lined with various phones and phone accessories
BRADDON painfully thin with spiky hair bad skin and
elvish ear-extensions hits on a FEMALE CUSTOMER

BRADDON
Now this one comes with customizable
ringtones and dual vibrating mode which
can come in quite handy in certain
situations

The bell jingles as Paul walks in quietly

FEMALE CUSTOMER
And what situations would that be

BRADDON
(leaning closer)
What’ve you got in mind

FEMALE CUSTOMER
Id like a word with your manager

He shows her his employee badge that reads “MANAGER” just
below his name “BRADDON MELLINS”

BRADDON
What seems to be the problem Miss

FEMALE CUSTOMER
They should lock you up

BRADDON
Bondage Naughty cheeky but presto you

BRADDON (CONTD)

to Braddon

Paul takes the application and gets to work
EXT PORT TALBOT STREET - NIGHT

Paul walks home from the interview passes a pub The
Forge Tavern from which numerous UNION MEN have spilled
out onto the sidewalk

Paul lowers his head and gives the men a wide berth until
one DRUNK man stumbles into him and “accidentally” drops
his beer

FIRST DRUNK
Watch where you’re going Martha

PAUL
Sorry

He tries not to break stride but the man grabs his arm
threateningly

FIRST DRUNK
Sorry ain’t gonna pay for a new pint is
it

Suddenly the drunk is jerked backwards and ends up on his
ass

ROLAND
(standing over him)
I‘1l thank you to leave him alone now
Peter

FIRST DRUNK
‘Not my fault he can’t walk straight

SECOND DRUNK
Probably ‘cause his teeth are all
crooked
THIRD DRUNK

Paul walks down the center of the road Roland jogs after
him

ROLAND

ROLAND (CONTD)

Lifted some weights

PAUL

ROLAND
Oh Well done So you’ll be getting

PAUL
Actually um I’ve been saving up for
opera lessonsin Italy

ROLAND
Youre twenty-nine years old Paul
Singing lessons can wait

They turn up the path to their home Paul hesitates a
moment letting Roland go up the steps ahead of him
Furious he opens his mouth to speak but loses his
nerve

Music is heard - Pavarotti singing “Che Gelida Manina”
from La Boeme

CUT TO

INT PAUL’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

TRACK ACROSS walls plastered with posters and downloaded
print-outs of images from the opera world The Three
Tenors Caruso a program from La Traviata in Rome and
finally a virtual shrine to Pavarotti his great hero
ENDING ON

A PAIR OF KNITTING NEEDLES

Pointed skyward quivering slightly in anticipation
Then slicing and waving through the air as Paul angrily
“conducts” the music as the refrain kicks in

Gradually Paul is enveloped and the thrashing needles
slow and subside and finally slip to the ground as
panting he stops the record revealing a muffled BANGING
coming from downstairs

INT KITCHEN - NIGHT

As Paul makes his way down the stairs and into the kitchen
where Roland is already at the table

ROLAND
Always with the bloody violins Won’t
shed a tear when they’ve packed and gone

YVONNE

As she places an enormous plate in front of Paul

ROLAND

the door as it is

PAUL
(to Roland)
Look I get it I’m never going to be a
professional singer I just It’s the
only thing that makes me-- Let me go to

Yvonne looks at Roland eyes pleading Paul’s case

INT STIARWELL - DAY
As Paul gasping and sweating and carrying two moving

boxes climbs several flights up the increasingly narrow
staircase until he reaches the top floor and the door to--

INT A TINY STUDIO APARTMENT - DAY

Where he drops the boxes alongside several others The
room is partially unpacked with his pictures of Pavarotti
and Toscanini already hung with prominence and his
computer has been set up atop a “desk” made from several
other boxes

A CHIMINGBOUNCING MESSAGE is seen on the screen Paul
clicks on the message revealing a kitty-kat avatar which
expands into a Chat Invitation from “julzRulz”

(after a beat)
Right

PAUL

get offended

JULZ

PAUL

(deletes the word girl
replaces it with)

--a woman right

He sighs with relief at her response and continues

“chatting”

I could feel the firming of her breasts

BRADDON (0S)

as she pressed them into me

INT CAR PHONE WAREHOUSE - DAY

CUT TO

Where Braddon is in mid-soliloquy as he and Paul stock
shelves with bluetooth ear-pieces

“Be gentle” said she
meant for human love” “But lady” said
“IT am only half human” And I laid her
amidst the moss

I
down and took her there
and leaves of the forest floor

BRADDON

Suddenly Paul sees something over Braddon’s shoulder and
darts through the curtains into the back of the store

BRADDON (CONTD)
What’s crawled up his--

He turns to the storefront where Matthew enters
belligerently wearing a blue janitor’s uniform and
carrying a smashed cell phone

MATTHEW
The service on this phone is total crap

BRADDON
It can’t be bad as all that I can see
quarter crap or maybe even half--

As Matthew dumps the smashed cell phone on the counter

BRADDON (CONTD)
Right the thing is in order for the
service to actually work the phone
itself should really be in no more than
three or four pieces

MATTHEW
(threatening)
It’s under warranty

BRADDON
Of course but--

MATTHEW
How ‘bout you gimme a phone that works
properly and I won’t cram this one down

the bag

JULZ

What bag is that

HYDRANGEA

PAUL
(stunned)

forehead

HYDRANGEA

She drags him away leaving Julz looking at the
embarrassed Paul with raised eyebrows

PAUL

JULZ
You’re joking

PAUL
The less you think about him the better

INT PAUL’S BEDROOM - DAY

Only slightly progressed since last time The boxes are
gone and yet it feels even smaller

Julz marvels at the collection of opera posters and
flyers

JULZ
Wow I knew you were into opera but I
didn’t know you were completely mad for
it

PAUL
I’m not fanatical about it or anything
(off her look)
Okay maybe just a little bit

Julz looks at a yellowed framed newspaper article

JULZ
What language is this

PAUL
Portuguese It’s the--

JULZ
You speak Portuguese

PAUL
Not at all I had it translated though
It’s the story of Toscanini’s first
performance in 1886

Realizes he’s probably boring her

JULZ
Go on

She glances at his knitting needles on the bedside
tables He’s relieved when she doesn’t ask

PAUL

He was a cellist in an Italian opera
company that was touring South America

(points to the date)
One night in 1886 their conductor was
booed by the audience and literally
forced to leave the podium In
desperation the singers suggested their
assistant Chorus Master take over because
he knew the whole opera by heart

JULZ
That’s a lot to memorize is it

PAUL
Um yes it is And though he had never
conducted anything before Toscanini
threw aside the score and led a
sensational two-and-a-half hour
performance completely from memory He
was nineteen

JULZ
And then he became quite famous didn’t
he

Shes seeing his deepest desires on his sleeve He
realizes he’s gotten carried away

PAUL
Sorry
He smiles

JULZ
For what I wish I loved something that

much

PAUL
There must be something

JULZ

Not yet anyway

as he realizes s

he means him

JULZ (CONTD)
Best get to my train

EXT SWANSEA RAILWAY STATION - DAY

Paul and Julz stand side-by-side still holding hands as

Then she kisses him deeply soundly with just a bit of

tongue

PAUL
(gobsmacked)
Right
JULZ
See ya Brad
PAUL

Bye Cameron

Almost without thought he pulls her to him and kisses her
again Gradually realizing he might have been too forward
as evidenced by the shy look on his face as their lips
part

The smile that blooms in her mouth and eyes says otherwise
as she opens one of the train doors and climbs aboard

He follows her down the train until she finds a seat He
waves and smiles and she closes her eyes and kisses the
window between them The glass steams from her breath and
she draws a heart around the imprint of her lipstick

The train pulls away leaving Paul alone but brimming on
the platform

Shots of BUS PASSENGERS staring at something in the back
of the bus

Reveal Paul dressed in a puffy white clown costume with
large neck ruffles grapefruit-sized pom-poms a fake

beard and white face paint with black vertical lines
bisecting his eyes

He feels the stares and tries to look as if he doesn’t
notice them

BRADDON (0S)
Have you gone completely up the pole

EXT FINNEGAN’S PUB - NIGHT

Paul looks down at himself embarrassed

PAUL

CUT TO
A STACK OF RENTED PA SPEAKERS
INT FINNEGAN’S PUB - NIGHT

The opening beats and squeaks of George Michael’s “I Want
Your Sex” blare

Braddon jumps into frame wearing nothing but a thin pizza
box around his waist

BRADDON

Theres things that you guess And things
that you know Theres boys you can
trust And girls that you dont Theres
little things you hide

(indicates his groin)
And things that you show

(turns showing everyone his

butt)
Sometimes you think youre gonna get it
But you dont and thats just the way it
goes

The audience is stunned but some are laughing and
Hydrangea dressed in shimmery white robes with a tiny nub
of horn atop her forehead sings along to the chorus as
Braddon thrusts his pizza box at her

UNICORN GIRL

no lies I dont need no bible Just look

INT FINNEGAN’S PUB - NIGHT
Braddon does an awkward split as the song ends

BRADDON
C-c-c-c-c-c-come on

The audience cheers and laughs as he climbs to his feet
trying to hold the pizza box together Hydrangea hugs him
and pulls him into the crowd next to Paul who’s still in
shock

PAUL
Well done

BRADDON
Yeah thanks mate It’s a gift from--

Kisses his finger then points to heaven Over by the
karaoke equipment the EMCEE reads from his list

EMCEE
And now singing Blimey
(squints)
Vesti la goober The vocal stylings of
Paul Poots

Braddon and Hydrangea clap wildly shoving Paul onto the
stage The audience quiets for a moment taking in his
costume until the music starts violins and cellos

Paul opens his mouth to sing but the crowd immediately
ignores him beginning to chatter amongst themselves

Paul begins to sweat as the music continues to play
Braddon and Hydrangea spur him on

BRADDON
Go on

But the crowd are getting rowdy with themselves Paul’s
nerves are getting the better of him The emcee stops the
music Starts it again

Braddon chews his thumbnail nervously as Paul begins to
sing

PAUL
Vesti la giubba e la faccia infarina La
gente page e rider vuole qua E se
Arlecchin tiinvola Colombina ridi
Pagliaccio e ognun applaudira

No one’s listening The the music swells and his voice
rises above the crowd not necessarily great but far
above average and very loud

PAUL (CONTD)
Tramuta in lazzi los spasmo ed il pianto
in una smorfia il singhiozzo e ‘1 dolor
Ah

Conversations begin to tail off and people have no choice
but to watch and listen to Paul Braddon can’t believe his
ears

BRADDON
Bloody hell

---as Paul launches into the aria
PAUL
Ridi Pagliaccio sul tuo amore infranto

Ridi del duol che tavvelena il cor

The song ends and the pub is deathly quiet Paul
realizes he’s made a complete fool of himself

As Paul exits the pub with a sulking Braddon and Hydrangea
and dozens of well-wishers who continue to congratulate

Paul and clap him on the back

With a nudge from Hydrangea Braddon half-heartedly
congratulates Paul

BRADDON
Well done I suppose I still reckon the
fix was in

PAUL
There’s always Christmas

BRADDON
(brightening)
Bloody well right

HYDRANGEA
Congratulations

PAUL
Good night

They walk off with Braddon singing a scratchy “operatic”
Good King Wenceslas He puts his arm around Hydrangea but
she shrugs it off

Paul smiles then pulls out an envelope revealing

A CHECK FOR THREE THOUSAND POUNDS

He allows himself a two-step jig before tucking the check
back inside the envelope when suddenly

He’s jerked roughly backwards by his collar and slammed
down onto the pavement

MATTHEW
Well if it isn’t everyone’s favorite
circus freak Hallo Potsy

He and another HOOLIGAN stand over Paul

PAUL
Get off me

He tries to stand but Matthew kicks his ribs Paul
buckles

MATTHEW
What’ve we got here then

He snatches the envelope from Paul’s hand Paul lunges for
it but Matthew sidesteps and Paul’s face hits the curb

MATTHEW (CONTD)
Bloody hell have a look at this

HOOLIGAN
(eying the check)
What’s an obese clown doin’ with this
kind of dosh

PAUL
Give it back

With surprising speed he finds his feet and SMASHES
Matthew in the face with all his might

Matthew blinks but appears otherwise unfazed He holds up
the check

MATTHEW
You’re gonna pay for that

He puts the check in his pocket and is about to lay into
Paul when suddenly Braddon leaps onto his back letting
out a war cry--

BRADDON
May the Flame of Arveron sustain me

Matthew recovers his balance and struggles to free himself
from the clinging scratching screaming Braddon finally
dumping him on the pavement next to Paul who has been
held down by the Hooligan

HOOLIGAN
Here

He tosses Matthew a brick Matthew raises it over his
head about to smash Braddon when it suddenly falls out
of his hand as his face goes limp and he falls to the
pavement revealing--

HYDRANGEA

Standing behind him wielding a cricket bat

HOOLIGAN (CONT’D)
Where the hell’d you get that

PARTYGOER
From me

The Hooligan turns to see a group of PARTYGOERS dressed in
various sports costumes football (aka soccer) rugby
cricket etc

PARTYGOER (CONT’D)
She’s welcome to it as long as she likes

Or we can use it for her

The Hooligan runs Braddon and Paul help each other up

BRADDON

HYDRANGEA
You already were my servant

BRADDON

Hydrangea rolls her eyes as Paul reaches into Matthew’s
pocket and removes his check Matthew’s eyes open

that makes you mine

INT PAUL and JULZ TINY APARTMENT - DAY
Where a radio plays a commercial for BRITAIN’S GOT TALENT

“searching for the next singing dancing or other talent
sensation” and a hundred thousand pounds to the winner

The ad is followed by Andrea Bocelli’s rendition of Con te
Partiro Paul reaches out and switches the station to
Coldplay

He’s reclining on an orthopedic chair while surfing the
internet for debt consolidation information He’s gained
weight again and his hair is unkempt

The doorbell rings and he hoists himself to his feet with
a grunt and shuffles his way over to the door which he
opens to reveal Braddon

BRADDON
Are you Paul Potts

PAUL
No

BRADDON
Perfect then you’re just the man I’m
looking for

before turning and shuffling back home

She takes his hand as he looks away sensing her pity but
not wanting to talk about it

to shove the coin aside and instead ends up knocking
everything off the table waking Julz
