Final Shooting Script

BLACK SCREEN

RAV ZINGESSER
And God said to Abraham Take your
son your only son whom you love
Isaac and go into the land of Moriah
and offer him there for a sacrifice
upon a mountain that I will show you

INT YESHIVA CLASSROOM -- DAY

A run-down place A dozen 12-year-old BOYS sit at old-
fashioned desks These are not Hasidim but Orthodox Jews
normal American kids in yarmulkes The teacher RAV
ZINGESSER is young overweight acnescarred good-humored

RAV ZINGESSER
And why did the Holy One -- blessed
be He -- do this Why did he ask
Abraham to sacrifice his only son
whom he loved

Two boys off to one side AVI (a smart tough brownnose)
and DANNY (the eternal dissident) argue under their

12-YEAR-OLD DANNY
Isaac wasnt his only son Ishmael
was his son too

12-YEAR-OLD AVI
The only son he loved

12-YEAR-OLD DANNY
Oh they only kill them when they
love them

12-YEAR-OLD STUART
(up front answering Zingesser)
t was a test of Abrahams faith Of
his devotion to God

12-YEAR-OLD DANNY
ts not about Abrahams faith Its
about Gods power God says You
now how powerful I am I can make
you do anything I want no matter how
stupid Even kill your own son
Because Im everything youre nothing

TITTERS Danny looks around at his classmates nerds
wankers nose-pickers Two kids in back furtively read the
racing form under their desks He hates them for their
indifference as much as he despises Stuarts piety or Avis
ass-kissing

RAV ZINGESSER
But Danny if HaShem is everything
and we are nothing how are we to
judge His actions

12-YEAR-OLD DANNY
We have free will and intelligence --
which God allegedly gave us

AVI
Anyway God never lets Abraham kill
Isaac He provides the ram so that --

12-YEAR-OLD DANNY
Personally I think thats a lie I
think he did kill him

RAV ZINGESSER
You think Based on what

12-YEAR-OLD DANNY
Theres midrash supporting this My
father read a book by Shalom Spiegel
that -- Isaac actually died and was
reborn

RAV ZINGESSER
No one follows that midrash

12-YEAR-OLD DANNY
I do I follow it But okay say God
provided the ram So what Once
Abraham raised the knife in his
heart it was as if hed killed him
He could never forget that And
neither could Isaac Look at him
hes traumatized hes a putz for the
rest of his life By the end he cant
tell Jacob from Esau

The kids laugh Zingesser CRACKS a ruler against a desk

RAV ZINGESSER
Watch your language

12-YEAR-OLD DANNY
(rising impassioned)
I think the whole Jewish people were
permanently scarred by what happened
on Mt Moriah and we still live in
terror

12-YEAR-OLD STUART
Fear of God is the beginning of wisdom

12-YEAR-OLD DANNY
Fear of God makes you afraid of
everything All the Jews are good at
is being afraid And being sacrificed

Oooo CRACK CRACK CRACK Even the guys with the sports
pages are shocked by that one

12-YEAR-OLD STUART
Dont you believe in God

12-YEAR-OLD DANNY
Im the only one here who does
believe You say hes mysterious yet
merciful I see him for the power-
drunk madman He is And were
supposed to worship such a Deity I
say Never I sayfight him I say --

The ruler has been CRACKING from power-drunk on Now
Zingesser grabs Danny yanks him out of his chair

station

The

remove Danny from the class

Avi rises grinning asDanny struggles wildly to get

RAV ZINGESSER
And you if you had come out of Egypt
you would have been destroyed in the
desert with those who worshipped the
Golden Calf

12-YEAR-OLD DANNY
Then let Him destroy me now Let Him
crush me like the conceited bully He is
(to the ceiling)
Go ahead Kill me Here I am Do it

The class sits frozen in terror waiting for God to kill
Danny But nothing happens

INT YESHIVA STAIRWELL -- NIGHT
Danny runs down the steps alone
EXT RUN-DOWN COMMERCIAL AREA -- TWILIGHT

Danny walking home alone He sees TWO KIDS (older tougher
blonder) coming toward him He slips off his yarmulke and
slants across the street The kids slant that way He hears
a RUMBLING looks up at an ELEVATED TRAIN entering a

He runs up the steps toward the SHRIEKING train
INT 7 TRAIN -- 1998 -- DAY
TITLE 13 YEARS LATER

The train passes above used car lots discount furniture
stores residential side streetsfinally pulls into a
station The doors open People file on the CAMERA letting
them go by until it spots a tall thin COLLEGE STUDENT in a
YARMULKE Danny grown up

PAN with him as he sits opens an organic chemistry text

doors close The train starts up but the Jewish boy hardly
notices he is already reading He sways with the motion of
the car half-hidden by other passengers We realize he is
being watched

REVERSE ANGLE another YOUNG MAN standing -- a SUEDE-HEAD
(his hair cut so short its like a fine fabric)
FLOOR

SUEDE-HEADS POV THE JEWISH BOY pushes his glasses back up
his nose wipes the nose with a handkerchief puts the
handkerchief away and all the time his eyes have not left
the page Suede-head steps between passengers and stands
directly over the Jewish boy He looks down at the yarmulke
pinned to the stiff wavy hair at the oversized shirt
collar scrawny neck prominent Adams apple pimples
dandruff ingrown facial hair

He steps closer crowding the boys knees The boy shifts a
little without looking up Subtly but relentlessly Suede-
head pursues him along the bench until unable to slide
farther the boy flattens his legs against the seat Suede-
head presses into the boys knees

The boy accidentally bumps a BUSINESSMAN to Suede-heads
left The man (late 30s Wall Street Journal African-
American) looks from the boy to Suede-head and understands
at once what is going on

Suede-head stares right back -- and the BUSINESSMAN returns
to his paper Suede-head eases him aside and steps on the
boys shoe

SHOES -- A HEAVY BLACK BOOT PINS A BROWN WINGTIP TO THE

The wingtip wiggles back and forth finally working free
The boy still hasnt looked up

SUEDE-HEAD and THE JEWISH BOY

swaying locked in a strange silent intimacy Suede-head
forces the boy into ever more contorted postures
increasingly ridiculous denials of what is happening And
the boy not only never stops reading the chemistry text he
keeps highlighting relevant passages

The train slows The boy closes the book caps the
highlighter gathers his things and manages to stand up
wriggling awkwardly around Suede-head The doors open he
gets off

INT STATION -- DAY

Looking up a long escalator the Jewish boy riding down
toward us

Suede-head arrives on the run at the top races down a
flight of stairs vaults the bannister slides down a metal
slope
strong

has

bed

Lands on his feet and comes to stand at the foot of the
escalator

The boy rides inexorably down At the bottom he tries to go
around Suede-head who blocks this way then another driving
him into a corner

The boy realizes he has nowhere to go -- finally turns to
face his tormentor Their eyes meet for the first time He
is actually bigger than Suede-head but not nearly as

He wont fight is simply acknowledging what he can no
longer deny There is even an odd relief that disgusts
Suede-head more than all the rest

SUEDE-HEAD
Fucking kike

He slaps him in the face He stumbles backward As Suede-
head goes to hit him again the boy holds his books in front
of him Suede-head punches the books straight into his face
The boy falls curls into a fetal position Suede-head kicks
him

SUEDE- HEAD
Get up Get the fuck up

He wont budge Suede-head punches him repeatedly until he
hears VOICES approaching He runs back up the stairs to the
train and only as we FOLLOW him do we realize that he is our
protagonist This is Danny grown up

CUT TO
INT DANNYS STUDIO APARTMENT -- NIGHT
Like his brain the room is at once crowded and tidy and

so far as we can see neither windows nor doors Shelves of
books CDs magazines videotapes loom over a neatly made

Danny in briefs and boots is lifting weights The phone
rings A machine picks up no outgoing message only a BEEP
Then

WOMANS VOICE
Is this working Im trying to reach
Danny BalintDanny its Vicki we
met at Happy Jacks last month

WOMANS VOICE

together again Give me a call --

She hangs up A moment later Danny finishes the set gasping
for air heart pounding muscles throbbing

INT SAME -- NIGHT

A radio is playing the news Danny sits at a small desk on
the phone and browsing the Internet a take-out menu beside

DANNY (INTO PHONE)
Is it completely vegetarian
What do they make the stock
from Not chicken youre sure

EXT VOMPADINK -- TWILIGHT
A tough working-class Queens bar

INT VOMPADINK -- TWILIGHT

Men drink in clusters including a group of skinheads
Danny takes a place alone at the bar drawing furtive
attention from the regulars When the BARTENDER finally
comes over

DANNY
Vodka tonic
A strange call for this place As he waits Danny turns and
watches the skinheads enough to make them aware of him

The girls watch him too The skins dont like that One of
them (Billings) seems ready to do something about it The
others try to calm him and when they look back Danny has
left He barely touched the drink

The skins are puzzled but one indicates his watch time to
go They gather their stuff

EXT CITYINT 7 TRAIN -- EVENING

Looking out the front of the train as it rushes toward
Manhattan A dramatic sky rises above the skyline

EXT STREET -- NIGHT

The three skins -- OL CARLETON BILLINGS -- walk up an
East Side street Billings is telling a story

BILLINGS
So she takes the pants in back --
where they try them on And I think
fuck it

CARLETON
Are you shitting me Right in the store

BILLINGS
Shes been giving me the eye Shes
hot So I wait till the owner goes up
front

During this OL starts to SPRAY PAINT a crude SWASTIKA
onto a BUS KIOSK A VOICE startles them

VOICE
What are you doing

They jump turn Danny steps out of the shadows

DANNY
(indicating swastika)
What do you think youre doing

BILLINGS
Who the fuck are you

DANNY
(coming toward them)
Who am 1 Who are you you schmucks
you cant even make a decent
swastika Give me the paint

(OL looks to his friends)
Give it to me

Dannys will is stronger OL hands over the spray can
Danny shakes it critiques OLs rendering

DANNY

(gruff but avuncular)
Its too squared off You got to
orient it up and down diamond-shaped
like this

(sprays an excellent swastika)
The arms go clockwise

(hands the can back)
Youre going to Curtis Zampf me too
Lets go

They exchange looks how did he know about Curtis

CURTIS ZAMPF (0S)
Where I grew up in South Boston
twenty years ago when a kid walked
down the street everyone knew who he
was

INT LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT

Grand but threadbare The skins enter OL like a child
Carleton like a sardonic adolescent Billings like a
revolutionary Danny like an uncrowned prince

CURTIS ZAMPF is addressing a dozen or so guests He is 40
but appears younger with rough good looks longish hair and
a leather jacket he seems more like an aging rock star or
sexy novelist that a standard-issue American Nazi

CURTIS
If he ran out in front of a car
some old Mickd yell at him Jimmy
Dunne get back on that sidewalk and
stay there

He does the Boston Irish accent so well everybody laughs
Up front we notice the only WOMAN in the room She is in her
40s regal beautiful forbidding Her name is LINA MOEBIUS

CURTIS
The day he graduated high school
hed go see his uncle down at the gas
works or the priests brother in the
shipyard get his apprentice papers
eight years later hed be making
1650 an hour have four kids play
ball on Sundays in Columbus Park and
when he died the whole townd get
drunk and cry over him

The crowd -- nonunion electricians white taxi drivers
unemployed bookkeepers failed academics off-duty cops --
listens quietly

During this a young woman (CARLA) appears from the rear of
the apartment heading for the kitchen with a coffee cup and
a history book She glances into the living room

CURTIS

Today when that kid walks down
the street its full of trash and
half the faces are black The
shipyards closed all the jobs at
the gas works are set-asides and by
the time he drops out of school he
can barely get a job at Burger King
So he drinks smokes crack and when
he hangs himself on the front porch
at twenty-three the only people at
his wake are a couple of buddies and
his mother The boys father wont
find out hes dead till six months
later

(beat)
The soul of this country is being
destroyed and all the government can
offer is free trade mutual funds and
IPOs

GUY DANIELSEN
You sound like a leftist

CURTIS
I used to be one No seriously I
called myself an anarchist I stood
up for the oppressed I opposed state
power

AN OLD COOT
Dont you still

CURTIS
I oppose the present state because
its weak It has been ever since the
left emasculated it over Vietnam But
I think the average man is crushed
less by accumulated capital than the
loss of community or real leadership
the personal emptiness he simply
cannot fill on his own
(matter-of-fact)
Thats why Ima fascist Its the
only form of government that
addresses our deepest needs

Silence Danny -- who has spotted Carla -- begins to clap a
few others join in Danny raises his hand Curtis nods to
him

DANNY
What do you think the fascism of the
twenty-first century will look like

Everyone -- including Carla -- turns to see who asked that

CURTIS
More cultural than political

DANNY
Obviously

CURTIS
Decentralized nonviolent
increasingly mainstream Well see
antiabortion anti-immigration groups
form alliances with the gun lobby
Christian identity types tax resisters
and even some libertarians

The crowd seems impressed but restless and bored

OLD COOT
What about race

A stirring many share the concern Lina watches closely

CURTIS
This isnt the time for that

Murmurs of surprise disappointment

DANNY
I disagree
(glances at Carla)
I think race is central to everything
were talking about
(murmurs of agreement)
Spiritual life comes from race From
the blood Without that were no
better than the Jews

The magic word The whole room comes alive Zampf grimaces

CARLA
Whats wrong with the Jews

MRS MOEBIUS
Carla

DANNY
Have you read Toynbee Spengler

CARLA
Nobody reads that stuff anymore

DANNY
Too difficult

CARLA
Too Christian You know Jameson Paul
Virilio

DANNY
The point is the modern world is a
Jewish disease

CARLA
Disease What disease

DANNY
Abstraction Theyre obsessed with
abstraction

That stops the conversation But Carla is intrigued here is
someone whose mind moves in strange and interesting realms

VOICE (GUY DANIELSEN)
What would you propose

The questioner is a young man (GUY DANIELSEN) better spoken
than the others Danny feels all eyes on him

DANNY
Killing Jews

A tremor of fear and excitement ripples through the room
Zampf glances at Mrs Moebius she is watching Danny
intently
CURTIS
That would be a catastrophic mistake

DANNY
People hate Jews Do you agree

CURTIS
They used to Today its not an issue

DANNY

No but deep down beneath the
tolerance they learn on television
nothings changed The very word
makes their skin crawl

(around the room people nod)
It isnt even hate really Its more
the way we feel when a rat runs
across the floor We want to step on
it Crush it We dont even know why
Its a physical reaction Everyone
feels it

GUY DANIELSEN
Which ones would you kill

DANNY
Prominent Jews Who are either
symbols in themselves or who
represent aspects of the Jewish
character people despise

GUY DANIELSEN
Such as

OLD COOT
Barbra Streisand

Mutterings Whos she Yeah her But Danny says

DANNY
Too obvious

VOICES
KissingerDershowitzRoseanne

DANNY
Yes And Larry King

OLD COOT
Is he Jewish

DANNY
Leona Helmsley Michael Eisner Bob
Dylan Phillip Roth Ruth Bader
Ginsberg Steven Spielberg Winona
Ryder Beverly Sills Alvin Toffler
Katherine Graham All of them But

not yet We dont want celebrity
obscuring the issue

CARLA
Which is what

DANNY
At first no one will know why the
victims are being killed

CURTIS
You wouldnt announce it

DANNY
Id say nothing After two or three
people will try to find a pattern A
reason

CURTIS
But when it comes out the public
will be outraged It will look like
Germany all over again

DANNY
Isnt that what we want Germany all
over again Only done right this time

The crowd feels a deep atavistic thrill Zampf glances at
Mrs Moebius

DANNY
Without speeches or political parties
A movement without leaders so that no
one can stop it

The room is stunned to silence Mrs Moebius signals Curtis

CURTIS
Okay lets break this up for now
(to Danny)
Could you wait a minute

INT SAME -- FIVE MINUTES LATER

Danny -- flushed with triumph -- stands looking down at the
city
ACROSS THE ROOM -- MRS MOEBIUS and CURTIS ZAMPF

CURTIS
(low)
I thought we agreed no anti-
Semitismits exactly what were
trying to put behind us Trash the
blacks fine but

MRS MOEBIUS
Did you see how they reacted to him

CURTIS
Yes of course But that only plays
in this room with people who arent
embarrassed to call themselves Nazis
£ you want a modern fascism you
dont mention Jews

MRS MOEBIUS
ts a romantic movement Curtis It
always has been

CURTIS
Lina the Thousand-Year Reich barely
lasted a decade Do you really

want to go down that road again In
America of all places where
obedience and discipline are not
exactly the national virtues

She looks over at Danny now chatting with Carla

LINA
Hes very bright

CURTIS
He speaks well But what do we do
with him

LINA
Lets find out who he is

CURTIS
You mean who he really is

ON DANNY and CARLA

CARLA

CARLA

DANNY

DANNY
I was going to ask you the same thing

Smiles laughter Everyone seems to relax

LINA
So what are you really after
Daniel Do you just want to kill

Jews or do you have something larger
in mind

Carla watches silent Danny is aware of both mother and
daughter
DANNY

Without blood -- a willingness to
spill it -- theres no real power no
authority

LINA

(pleased by this)
Curtis is afraid youll marginalize us

DANNY
Were already marginal We are saying
what no one else has the guts to say
Isnt that precisely our appeal

LINA
So what Jew would you kill first

DANNY
Ilio Manzettiformer ambassador to
France Managing partner at Damon
Schwarzchild

CURTIS
(to Lina explaining)
An investment banking house

MRS MOEBIUS
Hes Jewish Manzetti

DANNY
Totally The family emigrated from
Bulgaria when he was eleven

CURTIS
How would you kill him

DANNY
Id have to research it study his
routines his security But

ideally on a New York street at
midday using a small-caliber
automatic without a silencer

CARLA
Why no silencer

DANNY
You want it to be an event

Lina stands takes a sherry Everyone else rises with her

LINA
shut

vomiting

Danny why dont you come visit us in
the country We have young men with
lots of energy and no ideas Maybe
you could give them something to
think about Bring your friends

As Curtis leads him toward the door Danny looks around for
Carla hears WOMENS VOICES arguing in German Frustrated

he goes down the stairs

EXT STREET -- NIGHT

street drinking beer oblivious to traffic

The light has shifted across the city and we hear only a
muffled sobbing

The CAMERA TURNS to look atCarla and Danny naked on the

EXT QUEENS STAIRS TO ELEVATED TRAIN -- DAY

Once a Jewish neighborhood now occupied chiefly by blacks
Latins and more recent immigrants

As Danny (wearing headphones) comes down the steps TWO
BLACK KIDS (big menacing boombox) are coming up blocking

his way Danny walks right between them forcing them apart

They turn glare after him He turns glares back They
scoff and keep going up He walks on

EXT OZONE PARK HOUSE -- DAY

He lets himself into a row house We barely notice the
mezzuzah on the door post

INT OZONE PARK HOUSE -- DAY

A nearly vanished world of lower-middle-class Jewish life
though the Jewishness (menorah kiddush cup) is
restricted to one dusty corner behind a secular chaos of
books newspapers half-empty cups half-filled glasses

Dannys FATHER 55 sits on a faded chair an oxygen mask on
a cart beside him Dannys sister LINDA 30 is cutting his
hair with a scissors When Danny enters they both look up
at him in surprise alarm possibly even love For a moment
no one knows what to do

The father begins to wheeze puts the mask over his face and
breathes deeply Linda tells him to lean back resumes
cutting On the wall we see Dannys BAR MITZVAH PHOTO

Meanwhile Danny has found a stack of mail all addressed to
him His father and sister are visible behind him in a
mirror Without speaking he goes down the hall and we hear
him DESCEND STAIRS to

INT HOUSE BASEMENT -- DAY

Danny has taken off his coat (revealing a black T-shirt with
a red swastika) and is going through a number of cardboard
boxes marked D pulling out comic books baseball gloves
martial arts gear drawings of voluptuous women morbid
gothic figures gun magazines books about Hitler
Nazisand finally a 22 AUTOMATIC stuffed in a blue sock

INT HOUSE BASEMENT

He removes the clip checks the slide while nodding to the
MUSIC coming through his earphones He looks up sees LINDA
at the foot of the stairs pulls off the headset

LINDA
I knocked you didnt answer

Its too late to conceal the gun he places it beside him
She does her best to ignore the swastika shirt

LINDA
What are you doing here

DANNY
I just came to get some stuff Ill
be out in five minutes
(off her)
He doesnt want me around

She looks down as if that were not true or the way in which
it is too complicated to go into

LINDA
Hes going to die

(as Danny looks away)
He wont take his medicine He eats
dairy He probably still smokes when
Im not around

(off Dannys helpless gesture)
I asked him to come live with us
Alex offered to share his room
unsolicited But he didnt want to
be any trouble

DANNY
Then he couldnt be bitter about
living alone

LINDA
Why deprive him of his greatest pleas

They exchange what are almost smiles But then

shes been trying to avoid -- the only subject
erupts
LINDA
Ah Jesus Christ Danny how can you
wear that thing You know what it

means To your people

DANNY
Theyre not my people

LINDA
Tell it to Hitler

DANNY
Oh he decides Hitlers the chief
rabbi now

LINDA
Is this because of those kids who
used to beat you up

DANNY
What kids

LINDA
The Polacks From Sacred Heart

DANNY
Nobody ever beat me up
(as she sighs turns to go)
Look Linda therere fifty reasons
Even if you knew them all thered be

ure

the subject
-- suddenly
another fifty you didnt know

LINDA
Do you know them
(off him)
I made him some noodles for dinner
You can heat them up and --

DANNY
Ive got to get back to the --

LINDA
You can heat them up and eat with him

INT LIVING ROOM QUEENS HOUSE -- NIGHT

Danny (now wearing a plain white T-shirt) bends over the
coffee table eating a noodle casserole and reading the Post
His father eats off a TV table He finishes cursorily wipes
his mouth picks up a remote and turns on the television

DANNY
Its Friday

FATHER
(a hoarse rasp)
Do I give a shit

Danny holds up both hands hes not arguing simply
informing

FATHER

The Torah says not to light a fire on
the Sabbath because its work
correct

(Danny sighs)
But if alternating currents running
through the wires every second of
every day and I throw a switch send
it here instead of there how is that
lighting a fire

DANNY
Do chickens give milk

FATHER
Exactly

He channel-surfs until he comes to a stand-up COMIC doing a
routine They both watch

TV the COMIC is funny in a brutal compulsive way Lots of
pop references implicit postmodern nihilism The routine
reflects what Danny (and the Shiites the Unabomber Timothy
McVeigh TS Eliot et al) have against the modern world

FATHER
Whos this

DANNY
Dennis Leary

FATHER
Leary

DANNY
No

The father grunts with grim satisfaction he suspected as
much

DANNY
(offering consolation)
Howard Stern

FATHER
Obviously

Danny sighs why bother But adds

DANNY
Adam Sandler

FATHER
Funny

DANNY

EXT COFFEE SHOP QUEENS -- DAY

A HIGH-ANGLE view of the coffee shop After a moment Danny
enters frame starts toward it

INT COFFEE SHOP QUEENS -- DAY

Danny enters looks around To his surprise he sees GUY
DANIELSEN from the Nazi meeting rising extending his hand

GUY DANIELSEN
DannyGuy Danielsen

DANNY
(sardonic now he gets it)
You

Guy shrugs smiles apologetically
ANOTHER ANGLE -- DANNY and GUY WITH COFFEE

GUY
Milk

As Danny declines Guy gets out a small cassette recorder
is about to turn it on when he notices Dannys reaction

GUY
Is it okay if I record this

DANNY
No Yeah fine go ahead So
whats this about Is this about me

GUY
Im trying to figure out where the
radical right is going to nextI

thought you were the most interesting
person at that meeting

DANNY
What about Curtis Zampf

GUY
Curtis is a politician -- anda bit
of a hustler Hes not a thinker

DANNY
I agree

GUY
The other night you said the modern
world is a Jewish disease Could you
elaborate on that

DANNY
In the movement -- the racialist
movement -- we believe theres a

hierarchy of the races Not just in
TQ but in the civilization the art
the forms of government the
civilizations that each race
produces Why are you writing this
down if youre recording it

GUY
It helps me concentrate So does
that mean youre a white supremacist

DANNY
What should I be a white inferior-
ist A multicultural Zulu egalitarian
Let me ask where are your people from

GUY
My mothers family is French my
fathers was German originally

DANNY
German Mine too So who do you
thinks given more to the world the
Germans -- Beethoven Goethe
Nietzsche -- or the entire continent
of Africa Ibos Bantus Mandingos

GUY
Danny what about the Jews

Danny shifts in his seat growing more interested
DANNY
The Jews are different Blacks are
disgusting and inferior but its
like criticizing a retarded child
The Jews area poison in the human
well

GUY
A poison

DANNY
Let me give you an example Sexuality

GUY
Sexuality What do you mean

DANNY
You ever fuck a Jewish girl

GUY
What

DANNY
Did you ever fuck one Guy

GUY
(laughing embarrassed)
Whats that go to do withIve gone
out with a with Jewish women Why

DANNY
And WHat did you notice

GUY
Notice Like what

DANNY
Jewish girls like to give head right

GUY
I dont know Is that right

DANNY
And Jewish men like to get it

GUY
Everybody likes to dont they

DANNY
Yes Its very pleasurable But the
Jews are obsessed with it You know why
GUY
Why

DANNY
Because the Jew is essentially female

GUY
Female
DANNY
Real men -- white Christian men --

we fuck a woman We make her come
with our cocks But the Jew doesnt
like to penetrate and thrust -- he
cant assert himself that directly --
so he resorts to perversions Oral
sex is technically a perversion you
know that dont you

(as Guy nods)
After a woman has been with a Jewish
man she never wants a normal partner
again A normal man

GUY
Does that mean the Jew is the better
lover

DANNY
Youre not listening He isnt better
He gives pleasure but thats
actually a weakness

GUY
Danny what makes you think you know
all this

DANNY
Lets just say Ive done due diligence

GUY
So fine its not that the Jew the
Jews own the media and the banks
Its that theyre sexually corrupt

DANNY
The Jews clearly control the media
and the banks Investment banks not
the commercial ones But the point is
they carry out in those realms the
same principles they display in
sexuality They undermine traditional
life they deracinate society
Danny leans over to make sure Guys getting it right

DANNY
Deracinate Tear out the roots A
people -- a real people -- derives

its genius from the land the sun
the sea the soil This is how they
know themselves But the Jew doesnt
have soil

GUY
He has Israel

DANNY
Those arent Jews

GUY
Of course theyre Jews

DANNY
Notice the Israelis a fundamentally
secular society They no longer need
Judaism because they have soil The
real Jew is a wanderer a nomad He
has no roots no attachments So he
universalizes everything He cant
hammer a nail plow a field He can
only buy and sell invest capital
manipulate markets He takes the life
of a people rooted in soil and turns
it into a cosmopolitan culture based
on books ideas numbers This is his
strength
(pumped this is what
he loves)
Take the great Jewish minds Marx
Freud Einstein What have they given
us communism infantile sexuality
and the atom bomb In a mere three
centuries since these guys emerged
from the ghettos of Europe theyve
taken us from a world built on order
and reason and hurled us into a chaos
of class warfare irrational urges
and relativity a world where the
very existence of matter and meaning
is in doubt Why Because it is the
deepest impulse of the Jewish soul to
unravel the very fabric of life until
nothing is left but thread nothing
but nothingness Nothingness without

end

GUY
Are all Jews the same

DANNY
Differences exist of course but
theyre irrelevant For the Jew his
Jewishness dominates everything Even
the ones who renounce it who hate it
who want to cut it out of their
hearts a knifecant escape
Theyre still just Jews

Guy finishes writing that and looks up

GUY
Danny this is great Youre
incredibly articulate One more
thing How can you believe this when
youre a Jew yourself

A beat Danny smiles at the mistake

DANNY
What Excuse me
(Guy says nothing)
Youre kidding right

GUY
Do you know Rabbi Stanley Nadelman
He used to be at Congregation Beth
Elohim in Ozone Park

DANNY
Who How would I know him

GUY
He says you were bar mitzvahed there
in March 1988

DANNY
You believe that And you call
yourself a reporter

GUY
So youre saying its not true

DANNY
Look at me DO I look Jewish Look

He indicates his hair turns sideways to show his profile
GUY
Were you ever bar mitzvahed anywhere
else

DANNY
Do you know who youre fucking with here

GUY
Thats what Im trying to find out
Danny Who am I fucking with here

DANNY
(sputtering unsure
what to say)

Listen to me

GUY
Why would Nadelman lie

DANNY
To discredit me Because I know who
they are Look I thought I explained
it to you Those people can say or do
anything And they will Its all
narrative to them its Are you
going to print what this guy said

GUY
Give me a reason not to

DANNY
Its slander Its reckless disregard
Tll sue you and your fucking Jew paper

GUY
Does that mean you deny what he says
is true Yes or no

GUN pulled from Dannys pants slammed down on the table
Guy sits back abruptly Danny picks it up cocks it

DANNY

but people grab him this is Dannys problem

Steroid comes at him Danny steps inside the charge and
goes to work on the bigger mans body We barely see what
happens but we hear it and feel the crowds shock Danny is
stronger than we realized and much more vicious In seconds
Steroid sinks to his knees face bloody Danny holds up him

leans close

DANNY

Steroid mumbles in the affirmative Danny nods -- then hits
him four more shots to the face Even this crowd winces
Steroid drops with a wet thud

Then incomprehensible shrieking rage a fight breaking

Danny sighs bored He spots two nerdy Nazis KYLE and WHIT

easily have done hed have taken
England and the US wouldnt have

KYLE

just comes out for weekends sometimes

Danny squats to look at the board game

DANNY

INT COURTROOM -- DAY

A JUDGE (white-haired red-faced blue-eyed well-meaning)
peers down at the four NAZIS still bruised from the fight

JUDGE
As the altercation appears to have
been instigated equally on both sides
prison terms strike the court as
excessive

The Nazis are relieved Spectators disappointed

JUDGE
However the defendants political
views suggest that they might profit
from contact with members of our
community whose experiences differ
from their own

INT A SOCIAL ROOM -- DAY

NUMBERS TATTOOED ON AN ARMa thumb steadily smooths the
skin as

RUMANIAN WOMAN (0S)
(Rumanian accent uninflected)
When I refused to have sex with
him the warden had my sister Esther
executed in front of the entire block

The Nazis accompanied by a HATE COUNSELOR (male) sit in
plastic chairs opposite five elderly JEWS The speaker is in
her late 60s still something of a beauty

restless

wanted to tell

-- LATER

dozing staring out the window OL threads a

piece of dental floss through the zipper pull on his

trousers
Over this

Danny is visibly disgusted by the whole business
we hear

POLISH MAN (0S)
The man was afraid to let us hide
on his farm any longer but he agreed
to take us to a more remote place On
the way he was stopped at a checkpoint
and when the soldiers found us in the
hay one of them grabbed my son out
of my arms He began to cry so I
reached for him not to take him back
simply

THE MAN mid-70s tall stooped a crushed spirit

POLISH MAN
Simply to assure him I was there
But the sergeant became enraged
He stuck his bayonet in my sons
chest and lifted him up impaled on
it My son was three years old

Billings is muttering What a load of crap The Hate

Counselor

the story

looks over sharply The other Nazis are stunned by
Danny can barely contain himself though we are

not sure why

POLISH MAN
He held him up so that the blood
spurting out of him feel on my
face The soldiers were laughing

FLASHCUT EXT A COUNTRY ROAD -- DAY

A horse hitched to a hay wagon FARMER driving THREE NAZI
SOLDIERS have discovered a Jewish family hiding in the hay
A sergeant is holding up something unseen on the end of his
rifle

The Polish man who has been telling the story looks up at
whatever it is Blood falls on him The Nazis are laughing

POLISH MAN (0S)
When the blood stopped the sergeant
pushed my son off the bayonet and

said There you can have him now

BACK TO SCENE INT A SOCIAL ROOM -- DAY
The room is silent The Nazis faces blank shaken Until

DANNY
And what did you do

HATE COUNSELOR
What are you trying to say

DANNY
What did you do while the sergeant
was killing your son

BILLINGS
Forget it Danny its all bullshit

HATE COUNSELOR
Wait a second

DANNY
(to Billings)
Shut up
(to man mid-70s)
What did you do

RUMANIAN WOMAN
What could he have done

DANNY
What could he have done You fucking
kikes
HATE COUNSELOR
You cant say that

DANNY
The Nazis killing his kid He
couldve jumped the guy He couldve
gouged his eyes out grabbed the
bayonet and gutted him What would
you have done if they were killing
your son

The counselor is briefly confused

RUMANIAN WOMAN and OTHERS
Theyd have shot him on the
spot He would have been dead in
two seconds Who are you judge

HATE COUNSELOR
(to Danny)
Please sit down

DANNY
SO THEY SHOT HIM SO HE WAS DEAD SO
WHAT HES WORSE THAN DEAD NOW HES

You cant even imagine what that was
like And you never will

BILLINGS
Dont listen to them Danny Its all
a bunch of crap

ANCIENT JEW
What is crap

BILLINGS
The so-called Holocaust It never
happened Its the hoax of the
twentieth century
DANNY
(disgusted with this idiocy)
Oh please

BILLINGS
Danny its true There were no six
million At most two hundred
thousand Jews died in the camps And
the majority of them were from
disease and --

The Jews are shouting about historical records the
disappearance of families whole towns But Danny is
louder

DANNY
Where did you read this Robert
Faurisson

BILLINGS
(surprised he knew)
Yeah Hes a respected scholar Even
No-am Chomsky says he --

DANNY
Billings if Hitler didnt kill six
million why is he your hero
Concentration camps all over Europe
and he only gets rid of a measly two
hundred thousand Hes a putz

Some surprise that a Nazi is arguing against a denier

ANCIENT JEW
Hitler was not a putz Hitler was
real God created him to punish the
Jews for abandoning God

The other survivors are embarrassed by this but the Ancient
Jew ignores them

ANCIENT JEW
It is you who are putzes Little
pishas with your dreams of hatred and
killing

Danny scoffs gets up to leave

HATE COUNSELOR
Where do you think youre going

DANNY
We have nothing to learn from
these people They should learn from us

As Danny walks out the Ancient Jew catches his eye

EXT STREETINT OLS VAN -- EVENING

Danny is parked opposite a fortresslike building of soiled
brick For a long time he cannot bring himself to get out
Finally he opens the door

INT AHAVAT TORAH FOYER -- EVENING

A LARGE WOMAN about 40 her body barely contained by a
brilliant magenta dress greets him with a smile the size of
a wedding cake She holds out a prayer book stuffed with

LARGE WOMAN
Shabbat shalom

She speaks quietly not wanting to disturb the service yet
even so her voice is huge and her flashing eyes clearly
expect some kind of enthusiastic response Within we hear
the ALENU being chanted

Danny ignores her and the proffered siddur A basket of
yarmulkes seems to infuriate him but he snatches one anyway
and conveying a helpless disgust puts it on his head From
within he hears

CONGREGATION (0S)
(in rough unison)
Ba-yom ha-hoo ba-yom ha hoo (etc)

He stands with his hand on the door but not opening it

RABBIS AMPLIFIED VOICE (0S)
On that day the Eternal shall be One
And His Name shall be One

The organist plays a brief decrescendo

RABBIS AMPLIFIED VOICE
The mourners kaddish can be found on
page 187

LARGE WOMAN
Is anything wrong

DANNY
Shut the fuck up

Shes startled but not intimidated is about to respond
when Danny simply turns and walks out of the building

EXT AHAVAT TORAH -- EVENING
He stops beneath an open window through which he hears

gift O Thou Eternal source of peace

EXT AHAVAT TORAHSTREET -- EVENING

he starts toward his car But the Rabbis VOICE seems to
follow him unnaturally loud and clear

RABBI (0S)
May He cause the light of His
countenance to shine upon you and be
gracious unto you

DANNY
(to himself)
Eat shit

RABBI (0S)
-May you be blessed in your going
forth as you were in your coming

DANNY
(shouting to the empty street)
EAT SHIT ASSHOLES

RABBI (0S)
And let us say

RABBI and CONGREGATION
(with organ singsong)
Ah -- ah -- ahmen

As Danny reaches the van he sees the LARGE WOMAN

silhouetted
in the open doorway

LARGE WOMAN
YOU EAT SHIT

Danny realizes hes still wearing the kippah He throws it
at her but it only goes a couple of feet He catches it
throws harder This time it floats back toward him and he
has to jump out the way to keep it from hitting him He gets
in the car and drives off

A WRISTWATCH 1205 We are

EXT FARMHOUSE -- NIGHT

Danny hoists himself onto the kitchen roof Above him is an
open window candlelight flickering He starts into the

stops
INT BEDROOM -- NIGHT

Carla sits on the bed straddling Curtis who lies beneath
her She is looking right at Danny Curtis unaware of him
keeps thrusting into her from below

Danny starts to leave but on second thought stays Carla
stares expressionless yet more attentive to him than to
Curtis Indeed their eyes never leave each other so that
when she becomes aroused we understand that it is Danny she
is responding to Danny she is really making love to

Gradually her face loses its aloofness and seems to reach
out to him to reveal feelings that she can no longer deny
She holds her gaze until at the final instant she shudders
out a series of stifled cries

When she looks again the window is empty
INT DANNYS MOTEL ROOM -- DAY

Danny reading A KNOCK at the door He looks up Curtis

friendly

Then

Danny looks around like someone revisiting his childhood
home slides his hand along a pew backleafs through a

Okay lets take one of these panels

As they unscrew a panel Carleton runs past A football
flashes overhead We hear GLASS BREAKLAUGHTER

INT UNDER THE STAGE -- NIGHT

DANNY WATCHES KYLE attach a bomb (four sticks of dynamite
wired to a digital timer) to a 2x4 with a bungee cord He

hooks the ends cautiously lets go The cord springs free
The bomb falls

yle gasps Danny catches it
Frozen they look at each other Kyle exhales takes the

bomb and with Danny holding it carefully restrings the
bungee A MECHANICAL NOISE overhead

STEROID (0S)
Wow look at this shit

DANNY
What are they doing

Kyle has no idea and doesnt care Danny scrambles out

INT SANCTUARY -- NIGHT

Straightening up Danny is stunned by a vision

THE OPEN ARK -- THE TORAHS

their silver crowns and breastplates velvet robes And
Steroid Excess lifting one out Danny reacts with an
instinctive horror

DANNY
What are you doing Put that down
Put it back in there
Steroid -- cowed by Danny -- starts to obey but before he
can

BILLINGS
What do you care

DANNY
I dont but

BILLINGS
(vaults onto the stage)
Lets look at the fucking thing

Each CURSE makes Danny wince but he just hovers about
nervously as Billings and Steroid try to unwrap the Torah
while others gather some comically wrapping themselves in
tallises

DANNY
Put it there on the

He indicates the bema stepping back as if to deny any
involvement yet at the same time trying to monitor
everything they do

DANNY
(indicating crowns the
yod)
Just be careful with the

OL
(puts a crown on his head)
If I were king of the forestnot
Prince not Duke not Earl

Danny cannot endure this desecration but everyone else
laughs so he keeps his mouth shut

KYLE
Open it up

DANNY
(impulsively taking over)
Here

He shoves his way in and gripping the handles unrolls the

Torah Low MURMURS at the sight of the broad columns the

mysterious calligraphy the CRACKLING parchment Danny

himself is struck by the sudden immediacy of the sacred
text

OVER this
VOICES

Oooo Weird You read it from
right to left The letters look
like squashed bugs What kind of

paper is that

DANNY
Its not paper its parchment Its
made from sheepskin And all the
letters are drawn by hand

KYLE
Neat calligraphy

Danny nods then as if against his will

DANNY
Its called the flame alphabet Its
supposed to be the word of God
written in fire

BILLINGS
Fire

DANNY
The mystics tried to read the white
spaces around the letters They
thought there was a whole alternative
language hidden there with secret
alternative meanings

KYLE
Cool

Danny sees Drake watching him smirks to express his
disgust

BILLINGS
How come you know all this shit

DANNY
How come you dont know it
(pressing the advantage)
How can you say you hate the Jews
when you dont know anything about --

BILLINGS
Fuck you I hate the Jews at least as
much as you do

DANNY
No you dont If you hated them
youd study them so youd know why
you hate them You know what tefillin
is Tsitsis Shotness You know the
kaddish from the kiddush

(obviously not)
Eichmann He went to Israel He
studied the Torah the Talmud the
Mishnah the whole bit He hated Jews

CARLETON
Whos Eichmann

DANNY
Whos Eichmann

Dannys incredulous though its not clear how many of the
others know why Eichmann was

KYLE
He was head of the Gestapos Jewish
sector He deported people to the camps

CARLETON
(reaching toward the parchment)
Can we touch it

DANNY
Yeah but not on the letters

BILLINGS
Why the fuck not

DANNY
(warning finger)
Just dont

Billings bristles at Dannys authority Carleton says to
him

CARLETON
Didnt you see Raiders of the Lost Ark

BILLINGS
What

CARLETON
That was an ark man That was a
Torah They fucked around with it
and the Torah melted their faces

BILLINGS
Thats a movie you moron
CARLETON
Fine go ahead Touch the letters

The others are gathered around delicately touching the
sheepskin

BILLINGS
Let me see

He pushes through looks at the Torah He runs his fingers
over the crinkled parchment the smooth black letters

DANNY
I said not on the --

Suddenly Billings grabs the parchment in both hands and
tries to tear it Its tougher than it looks

DANNY
Stop it What are you doing

He tries to stop him but -- accidentally or not -- Drake
gets in the way and before Danny can do anything else
Billings crumples it and finally tears a long gash into the
scroll

This produces a strange effect on the others Some (Kyle
Steroid Drake) join in They knock the aitz off the bema
it rolls out exposing ten feet of Torah They stamp on it
spit on it Others (Carleton OL) though less troubled
than Danny are surprised (and embarrassed) by their own
revulsion at these acts

Danny watches helplessly like the survivor who did nothing
as his son was murdered

Finally the Torah lies torn and soiled on the stage A
strange silence

KYLE
Lets get out of here

Danny kneels by the Torah With a tallis he attempts to

clean the parchment Carleton and OL help him roll it onto
the aitz Echo Christ taken down from cross with Torah as
Christ They replace the cover the yod the crowns

Finally Danny lifts it up holds it to him as if it were his
dead child He closes his eyes murmurs to himself

DANNY
Shema yisrael adonai elohenu adonai
echod

CARLETON
Whatd you say

DANNY
Nothing Lets go

He starts to walk out carrying the Torah

CARLETON
Why are you taking that

DANNY

Rabbi Malcolm Weiss

ON TV Cindy (sleek sexy) and the rabbi (handsome vain)

CINDY (ON TV)
Rabbi how is it that disaster and
tragedy were averted here today at
Ahavat Torah

RABBI (ON TV)
Apparently the power cell in the
Torah

timer gave out precisely thirteen
minutes before the device was set to
go off So we can only conclude that
once again God has intervened to save
the Jewish people

DANNY
(giving the finger to
the TV)
Oh fuck you

RABBI (ON TV)
As you know Cindy thirteen is a
mystical number in the Jewish faith
We believe that God has thirteen
attributes

Danny is beside himself

RABBI (ON TV)
Of which the highest is ein sof
which means without end or
sometimes nothingness without end

CINDY (ON TV)
Nothingness without end Thats
very interesting

RABBI (ON TV)
The purest form of spirit

ON DANNY Sound fades Hes haunted Nothingness without
end was what hed told Guy Danielsen the Jews were obsessed
with He seems to hear the cello playing Kol Nidre again
Then

DANNY
Okay everybody out Get out

He switches off the TV Shoves them out the door slams it
INT DANNYS MOTEL ROOM -- LATER

Alone he sits at the desk finds himself gazing at the
standing in a corner of his closet draped in the tallis

He slams the closet door it bounces open Slams it again
making sure it latches

He sits down looks at the closed door until in bitter
resignation he gets up and opens it again
He unrolls the Torah on the bedScotch tapes the tear
closedattempts to clean the stain with a moistened cloth

INT DANNYS MOTEL ROOM -- DAY

Danny is in the bathroom in front of the mirror holding his
shirt up with his chin as he wraps the tallis around his
torso When he lowers the shirt the fringes hang out like
the tsitsis that Orthodox men wear

He feels a weird loathing for this but he smooths and
arranges the tsitsis to look just like a Hasids He clicks
his heels together and gives a Nazi salute

DANNY
Alenu lshabach laadon hacol

side of the building and eating a sandwich as Drake loads a
scoped rifle

DRAKE

your elbows

DANNY
Why me

DRAKE
You want to kill a Jew I already did

Danny assumes the prone position Drake sets the rifle in
his hands

DANNY

Curtis enter

DANNY

done there)

He stops short as Carla walks into the room for shopping
She glances at them puts down her bags goes into the
kitchen

CURTIS
Danny the night we met you said the
name Ilio Manzetti We were impressed
We were excited But here it is
September and Mr Manzetti is still
walking around breathing the air

MRS MOEBIUS
We need intellectuals we have enough
thugs already

Dannys watching Carla go down the hall toward the back can
barely bring his attention back to the conversation at hand

DANNY
Im not an intellectual I mean I
read but Fund-raising isnt what I

MRS MOEBIUS
Look if you want to kill Jews on
your free time fine We need you to
raise money Will you do that for us

He nods but cannot look at her

MRS MOEBIUS
Thank you

Hes dismissed He rises

MRS MOEBIUS

Do you have a suit

(off Danny to Curtis)
Lets get him one And a cell

a joke for her own amusement)
And if you insist on blowing up a

Fifth Avenue would you

DANNY
Beth Shalom Its Reform

MRS MOEBIUS
So what

DANNY
Theyre not that Jewish

MRS MOEBIUS

I dont care what they are I know

She smiles He manages a smile back and hurries away face
burning with shame

EXT MOEBIUS APARTMENT STREET -- NIGHT

Danny comes out of the building squats between two parked
cars and vomits retching spastically until gasping for
breath

He turns Carla walks over to him wipes his mouth with a
crumpled tissue When she moves to kiss him he holds back
shy about the smell but she kisses him anyway on the

INT DANNYS APARTMENT -- NIGHT

Carla naked browsing the books sees something in the
closet Its the Torah Danny took from the synagogue She
unrolls it on the bed her gaze moving over the mysterious
glossy script Danny coming out of the bathroom sees what
she is doing and stops short
CARLA
Whered you get this

DANNY
I stole it From a synagogue

She looks at the broad printed columns

CARLA
How come theres no punctuation

DANNY
That was a later invention its not
in the scrolls Anyway the Jews

know where the sentences end They
know the whole thing by heart Every
word Every letter

CARLA
Do you know it like that By heart

DANNY
No

CARLA
But you can read it the Hebrew
Right

DANNY

What do you care

CARLA
Cause I want to know What is
this word This one here

Danny looks at the word then back at her Hes torn between
competing desires but finally

DANNY
Va-yomer And he said
(she moves her finger
to the left)
It goes the other way

CARLA
(she knew that)
Oh yeah
(moves finger right)

DANNY
Va-yomer adonai el Avram lech lecha
mayartzcha oo-mimohlad-tcha oo-mbayt
avaycha el ha-ertez asher arecha

CARLA
Whats it mean

DANNY
And God said to Avram take yourself
away from your land and from the
place you were born and from your
fathers house into the land -- a
different land -- and I will show you

Danny remains silent a moment affected by the passage

CARLA
I want to learn to read it

DANNY
Why
CARLA
Know your enemy Cause its a

basic text of Western culture I want
to read it in the original Okay

DANNY
Hebrews very difficult It would
take years

CARLA
Im good at languages

He looks at the smooth expanse of her back the
articulations
of her spine He finds her very beautiful

DANNY
Put something on Youre not supposed
to be naked in front of it

CARLA
Why not

DANNY
They think its the word of God and
its holy and the flesh isnt

CARLA
Thats stupid

DANNY
Yeah its stupid
(indicating her T-shirt)
Put it on or I wont teach you

She grudgingly pulls on the shirt as he gets a pencil and
paper

DANNY
See the Jews love to separate things
the holy from the profane milk from
meat wool from linen the Sabbath
from the week the Jew from the
gentile As if one little scrap of
this was going to completely
contaminate that

CARLA
What assholes

DANNY
You cant curse in front of it either

He shrugs as if indifferent to these rules yet compelled to
point them out

CARLA
Who gets contaminated the Jews or
the gentiles

DANNY
Good question Both
(draws a letter)
Aleph

CARLA
It looks a little like a swastika

DANNY
Its silent It holds a place takes
a vowel The vowels are little dots
that go under the letters

Where are they

glances back at Danny

TWO NAZI SOLDIERS have just discovered a JEWISH FAMILY
hiding in the back of a hay wagon The POLISH MAN is holding

In an access of disgust the sergeant sticks his bayonet
into the boy -- or rather into something offscreen We hear
a terrible sound the child grunts The family gasps in

DANNY

Ill give your group a thousand bucks

DANNY
You gave fifty thousand to that

BRAND
Fiftys an exaggeration Anyway that

possible that arent now

DANNY
Actually I think this moment has
possibilities that --

BRAND
Yeah I read your piece Its very
smart And very wrong

Brands phone beeps he touches a button continues

BRAND
Forget the Jewish stuff It doesnt
play anymore
(over Dannys)
Theres only the market now and it
doesnt care who you are

DANNY
People still need values beliefs

BRAND

No they dont Not the smart ones

(because he likes him)
Look Ill give you five grand if you

Maybe I am Maybe were all Jews now
Whats the difference

On Danny troubled by this

INT A SMALL LECTURE HALL -- EVENING

A half-dozen white lumpen sit at desks Danny writes ANTI-
SEMITISM in large letters on a blackboard He turns

DANNY
How many of you think of yourselves
as anti-Semites

(All the hands go up)

Good Actually the term is a bit
imprecise since technically Jews are
only one of the Semitic peoples
In fact Arabs are Semites as are
the Eritreans the Ethiopians and so
on But for our purposes an anti-
Semite is someone who hates or is
against Jews Now why do we hate
them

He looks around The room is silent

DANNY
Let me put it another way Do we hate
them because they push their way in
where they dont belong Or because
theyre clannish and keep to themselves

Murmurs of Yeah Both But some are confused by this

INT SAME -- ANOTHER DAY

Slightly bigger crowd a few middle-class-looking people

DANNY
Because theyre tight with money
or because they flash it around
Because theyre Bolsheviks or because
theyre capitalists Because they
have the highest IQs or because they
have the most active sex lives

The audience confused

DANNY
Do you want to know the real reason
we hate them
INT SAME -- DAY

More people white collar workers of both sexes nurses
artists Lapel buttons bumper stickers backpacks FIGHT
NEW WORLD DISORDER STOP THE WTO EARTH FIRST

DANNY

-Because we hate them

(as people exchange

puzzled looks)
Because they exist Because it is an
axiom of civilization that just as
man longs for woman loves his
children and fears death he hates
the Jews

(smiles)
There is no reason If there were
some smart-ass kike would give us an
argument try to prove we were wrong
And of course that would only make us
hate them more In fact we have all
the reasons we need in three simple

times It is the only word that never

INT DANNYS APARTMENT -- NIGHT
Sweltering heat A fan ruffles Carlas hair as she lies on
the futon going back and forth between HebrewEnglish Torah
and a Hebrew grammar Danny is on the floor lifting weights

CARLA
(slowly laboriously)
Payn tash-chiton vashiytem

DANNY
(correcting her)
Vasitem
CARLA

Vasitem lechem pessel to-monat And
make no graven image of the Lord or
the form of any figure or of man or
woman or beast or fowl or fish or
anything that looks like anything
Because Hes not like anything Not
only cant you see Him or hear Him
you cant even think about Him I
mean whats the difference between
that and Him not existing

DANNY
(still exercising)
No difference

CARLA
Christianitys silly but at least
theres something to believe in Or
not believe Judaism theres nothing

DANNY
(to himself)
Nothing but nothingnessJudaisms
not about belief

CARLA
Whats it about

DANNY
About doing things You light candles
say prayers keep the Sabbath visit
the sick

CARLA
And belief follows

DANNY
No Nothing follows You dont do it
because its smart or stupid or it
saves your soul Youre not saved
Nobodys saved You do it because the
Torah tells you do You submit to the
Torah

CARLA
Fuck that

DANNY
Dont curse in front of it

CARLA
(flips the book closed)
Why should I submit

DANNY
You shouldnt

CARLA
You think I should just because
theres no reason

He looks at her without answering

In an access of something she bites his arm hard He
She kisses the place she bit He

winces

pushes her away

DANNY
No I think you shouldnt

CARLA
Judaism doesnt even need God You
have the Torah the law Thats your
fucking God
(anticipating his objections)
The books closed

starts to play with her hair

DANNY

Youre learning the Hebrew really fast

CARLA
I told you Im good at this

DANNY

Plus you have nothing else to do all day

CARLA
Oh am I learning it faster than you
did Maybe Im smarter
He laughs likes her arrogance But she misunderstands

CARLA
Is that funny You think Jews are the
only smart ones

As they make out grow aroused

DANNY
What You think Im Jewish

CARLA
Its all you talk about Jewish
Jewish Jewish Nobody talks about it
that much except the Jews

Dannys taken aback by the simple logic

DANNY
Nazis talk about it all the time

CARLA
Do they

And of course she has grown up among Nazis

DANNY
The real Nazis Hitler Goebbels
they talked about Jews incessantly
You ever read their diaries

CARLA
Is that why you became a Nazi So you
could talk about Jews incessantly

DANNY
Believe me Adolf Hitler couldnt
possibly have hated the Jews as much
as I do Not in a billion years You
know why

CARLA
Cause he wasnt a rabbi

DANNY
You want a punch in the mouth

CARLA
Okay
(he doesnt hit her)
Why dont we light candles on Friday
Lets light candles And say the
kaddish

DANNY
Kaddish is the prayer for the dead

CARLA
I mean kiddush Lets say kiddush
And shave my head fuck through a
sheet all that stuff
(as he walks away)
Come on just for fun To see what
its like

INT SMALL LECTURE HALL -- NIGHT

Packed with a well-dressed crowd very different from the
crowds weve seen here before

DOWN IN FRONT Mrs Moebius and Danny talk in low tones

MRS MOEBIUS
Half the right-wing money in New York
is here tonight They came to see you
If you impress them if you do what I
know you can this movement will be
up and running by tomorrow And on
the front page of the New York Times
in six months

She straightens his tie directs him toward the lectern
hesitates

DANNY
We tested the new bomb

MRS MOEBIUS
What

DANNY
We redesigned the timing mechanism
It cant possibly malfunction

MRS MOEBIUS
Danny please Just give your
speech And nothing about Jews okay

She walks away
INT SMALL LECTURE HALL -- STAGE -- NIGHT

Danny steps to the lectern The CROWD QUIETS He stands
silent for a long moment then closes his eyes and chants
with feeling

DANNY
Shema yisroel adonai elohenu adonai
echod

General confusion Mrs Moebius and Curtis exchange wary

glances

DANNY
Who knows what that is

VOICE
A Jewish prayer

DANNY
Can anybody imagine why I would say a
Jewish prayer

ANOTHER VOICE
Because youre a Jew

Nervous laughter Danny laughs with them

DANNY

That could be one reason Whats
another

(no response)
Let me put it this waywho here
would like to destroy the Jews

(murmurs of approval)
Who wants to grind their bones into
the dust

A scattering of applause growing more sustained

DANNY
And who wants to see them rise again
wealthier more successful powerful
cultured and intelligent than ever

Silence No one wants that

DANNY
Then you know what you have to do
You have to love them

Puzzled mutterings What Whats he talking about

DANNY
Did he say love them Love the Jews
It sounds strange I know but with

these people nothing is simple The
Jew says that all he wants is to be
left alone to study his Torah do a
little business and fornicate with
his over-sexed wife But it isnt
true He wants to be hated He longs
for our scorn He clings to it as if
it were the very core and mystery of
his being If Hitler had not existed
the Jews would have invented him For
without such hatred the so-called
Chosen People would vanish from the
earth

People react with confusion uncertainty suspicion

DANNY

And this reveals a terrible truth
the crux of our problem as Nazis the
worse the Jews are treated the
stronger they become Egyptian
slavery made them a nation the
pogroms hardened them Auschwitz gave
birth to the State of Israel
Suffering it seems is the very
crucible of their genius If the Jews
are as one of their own has said a
people who will not take yes for an
answer then let us say yes to them
If they thrive on opposition let us
cease to oppose them The way to
annihilate them utterly and
completely is to open our arms take
them into our homes and embrace them
Only then will they vanish into
assimilation dilutionand love

(a warning finger)
But we cannot pretend The Jew is
nothing if not clever He will see
through condescension and hypocrisy
To destroy him we will have to love
him sincerely

ON THE AUDIENCE befuddled A HAND goes up Danny nods to

The man steps forward and we see that its Guy Danielsen of
the Times Danny is shaken

GUY
But if the Jews are strengthened by
hate wouldnt this destruction you
speak of -- by love or by any other
means -- in fact make them more
powerful than they are already

DANNY
(after a beat)
Yes Infinitely more They would
become as God

Murmurs of confusion outrage God Danny notices
the TALLIS crawling out from under his shirt stuffs it back
in

DANNY

It is the Jews destiny to the
annihilated so that they can be
deified

(the murmurs swell)
Jesus understood this perfectly And
look what was accomplished there with
the death of just one enlightened Jew
Imagine what would happen if we
killed them all

(over the rising outrage)
So let us say together Shema
yisroel

One or two voices respond but must people shout him down
Mrs Moebius is outraged People are throwing things
shouting The meeting degenerates into chaos

INT SMALL AUDITORIUM -- TWILIGHT

The windows have darkened The congregation is on its feet
chanting the AVINU MALKENU the climactic prayer of the day

Danny leading the prayers looks up at Carla Stuart
Miriamnear the front chanting with him He looks at the
clock 721

Suddenly it seems impossible to go through with this He
stops praying but no one notices

EXT JEWISH COMMUNITY CENTER -- TWILIGHT

As Kyle Drake and Billings approach the place seems to
glow with an inner radiance Drake and Billings hold weapons
at their sides

The stocky security guard sees them coming and gets up
reaching for his gun Billings and Drake stop Kyle wishes
he werent here

Everything suspends for a moment as within the building
three distinct GROUPS OF VOICES can be heard each chanting
the AVINU MALKENU at a slightly different point in the

Drake raises his gun and fires
INT JEWISH COMMUNITY CENTER -- SMALL AUDITORIUM -- TWILIGHT

People are chanting AVINU MALKENU so fervently that the
GUNFIRE outside seems only a faint POPPING No one
particularly notices Danny freaking doesnt hear the
gunshots He tries to address the people in the front

DANNY
Wait a minute

But the praying is too loud too strong No one stops or
listens He steps down off the bema

DANNY
Stop praying Youve got to get out
of here All of you

A few people in front are puzzled by his strange behavior
but the rest keep chanting Stuart comes up to Danny

STUART

Danny glances over peoples heads at the clock 725 He
doesnt notice

THE DOOR

BANGS open DRAKE stands there 357 bleeding profusely
from the head the swastika on his lips At first only a
few people notice they stop praying

PEOPLE

Whos that What is heoh my God

Avi is the first one out of his chair walks right at Drake

AVI
(calm forceful)
Put down the weapon Put it down

Drake shoots him Avi goes down writhing in pain Screams
panic People come at Drake but he grabs an 11-year-old
girl puts the gun to her head

DANNY
Drake Up here

Everyone turns including Drake -- whos blinded by the
blood in his eyes but recognizes the voice

ENRAGED MAN
See he knows him The Nazi bastard

Drake moves unsteadily toward the front pulling the girl
with him A WOMAN (a doctor) goes to tend Avi who is still
conscious People begin to slip out the back taking
children Others stay looking to jump Drake but he keeps
the 357 on the little girl

DANNY
(to Carla Miriam Stuart)
Get everybody out of here Fast

He steps back onto the bema separating himself from the
others and drawing Drakes attention The clock reads 728
Outside we begin to hear SIRENS

DANNY

Drake refocuses pulls the girl on From the hall we
hear OTHER GROUPS in the building chanting
VOICES

Avinu malkenu choney-nu vaneyenu

(Our father out king graciously

At the front Drake wobbles People start forward He cocks
the gun against the little girls head Shes weeping
silently

DANNY
Drake Im right here

Drake looks Danny reaches out a hand Drake points the 357

at him and FIRES missing A HAND grabs the little girl
pulls her to safety

The room is nearly empty now save Miriam Carla Stuart a
few others The AVINU MALKENU can still be heard from the
hall

ENRAGED MAN

Drake wobbles from loss of blood Nearly drops the 357

others

DANNY

gun goes off Plaster rains down on them

Drake dies Danny catches him under the arms
He looks at the watch 732 He relaxes

VOICES

sudden silence Then a FLASH of light

The SCREEN GOES WHITE

CARLAS VOICE

INT STAIRCASE YESHIVA -- DAY

Where we saw Danny leave the school as a 12-year-old Now
LOOKING DOWN we see Danny as an adult coming up them two
at a time

FOLLOWING DANNY as he races up His old teacher RAV
ZINGESSER appears on a landing above

RAV ZINGESSER
Danny good to see youI wanted to
take up that discussion we were
having
(as Danny hurries past)
about Abraham and Isaac

DANNY
I cant right now

But as he nears the NEXT LANDING there is Zingesser waiting
for him again

ZINGESSER
You remember what you said that
Isaac actually died on Mt Moriah
Ive been thinking maybe youre
right Died yet was reborn in olam
ha-bah
Danny goes past once more

But now LOOKING DOWN at Zingesser as he appears above Danny
yet again As Danny nears the landing

ZINGESSER
Danny stop
(as Danny goes by
calling after him)
Where are you going Dont you
know theres nobody up there

As Danny passes the camera we PAN to watch him still racing
upward beyond us into the darkness

THE END
