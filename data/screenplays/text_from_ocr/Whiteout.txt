SCROLL OVER BLACK

Antarctica Six million square miles of ice The
coldest place on earth

Forty-six countries have competing claims and maintain
outposts The Antarctic Treaty holds these claims in
check

There is no regular law enforcement A single US
Marshal is assigned to the territory

END SCROLL

EXT ANTARCTICA - DAY

Snow-covered hills thrust up out of a barren white
wasteland No buildings no animals nothing

CLOSER The hills are more defined Rows of jagged
peaks and a crazed pattern of crevasses A fine ‘mist
of wind-blown snow whips about this jumble of glinting
ice

STILL CLOSER We track down through valleys skirt
crevasses climb peaks and finally pause on a flat
stretch of ice HOLD on this scene of timeless savage
beauty then
THUD

A FACE hooded and goggled in ECW (extreme cold weather
gear) drops into frame smashing down on the icy surface
with such brutal impact the shattered goggle shield pops
out --

-- EYES STARE BLANKLY into camera -- locked in death
Its a man

Camera slowly starts to PULL BACK to see his limbs have
snapped at unnatural angles the head grotesquely twisted
-- bright red arterial blood seeps from the corpse and
spreads out down tiny cracks in the ice until with
startling speed it turns dark and freezes

We PULL BACK further and look down on the body a bizarre
shape in a spiders web of frozen blood And SLOWLY WE
PULL BACK further and furtheruntil all is dazzling
white

TITLE WHITEOUT
DISSOLVE TO

The sounds of lapping surf and distant seagulls serenades
us like a rhythmic lullaby

-- CU on WOMANS TOES digging up soft white sand The
shadow of a palm tree cascading over top

Widen slightly -- a pair of feminine hands donning an
ANTIQUE SILVER ring on the left middle finger are slowly
applying coconut tanning lotion onto firm athletic
calves Deep Soothing Then --

OC KNOCK KNOCK on a door
The hands stop
Another KNOCK KNOCK

The lapping surf and seagull sounds come to an abrupt
halt

WOMAN (0C)
(slightly annoyed)
Yeah

Widen to meet CARRIE STETKO late 20s Cargo pants --
rolled up and an exercise top Shes kicking back but
shes not at the beach

n fact shes in an office sitting on a chair A NEWLY
PEN BAG OF KITTY LITTER sits next to a plastic tub shes
ot her feet in Two FLOOR LAMPS stand like sentinels
bove her blasting her with warm wattage A fake palm
ree casts the shadow across her body Shes pulled the
arplugs out of her iPod -- back to the real world

Ot MQoOoOH

The door opens Leaning into the room is JAMIE CLARK
(20s) African-American Shes dressed in a flannel
shirt jeans Carrie doesnt look entirely happy at the
intrusion

JAMIE
Sorry a Professor Sapperstein
needs to see you in biology Said
its urgent

CARRIE
Alright --

Jamie leaves

As Carrie gets to her feet camera moves away from her
panning around the small office Half-packed up boxes
lay strewn about the floor

A CALENDER hangs crookedly before a desk Each day has
been marked off with a large X THREE DAYS REMAIN
unmarked Last space reads WINTER-OVER and in the

space next to it theres a cut out picture of a tropical
beach

A dart board is next to it with A PHOTOGRAPH pulverized
with dart holes over the Bullseye Its of a candy-
striped pole topped with a silver ball surrounded by
international flags - the South Pole Carrie is standing
next to the pole smiling at the camera arm-in-arm with
SAM MURPHY (30s) Looks like hes handsome but his
face is a little more obliterated than the rest of him

CUT TO
EXT MCMURDO STATION - ANTARCTICA - DAY

An ugly sprawl of prefab buildings power-lines and above
ground sewage pipes It looks more like a Siberian work
camp than Antarcticas largest research base and
logistics hub In the background smoke rises from Mt
Erebus

SUPER MCMURDO STATION (USA)
POP 2137 TEMP -22°

An icy wind HOWLS but the base swarms with PARKA-CLAD
FIGURES shuttling supplies and packing up equipment for
winter

We PICK UP CARRIE AND FOLLOW her as she strides down the
icy unmade street Her hood is pulled up and shes not
enjoying the cold She reaches a row of buildings and
checks the names - GEOLOGY LAB 2ASTROPHYSICS -
BERKLEYuntil she reaches BIOLOGY BUILDING 7 and
pushes through the double doors into

INT BIOLOGY BUILDING 7 - DAY

LONG BENCHES are covered with ANTARCTIC FLORA - MOSSES
LICHENS and LIVERWORTS They are being nurtured and
studied by SCIENTISTS who look like homeless people -
unkempt beards bloodshot eyes and sun-damaged skin

Carrie throws back her hood and unzips her jacket
Approaches one of the scientists with familiarity who is
in the process of EXTRACTING an ICE-CORE SAMPLE from a
stainless steel cylinder

CARRIE
(SARCASTIC)
Hey Fred unlock any secrets of
the Universe -- discover were

Alien life forms

FRED
Workin on it
CARRIE
Which ones Sapperstein

SCIENTIST
Deschampsia Antarctica

He indicates with a nod to a bench covered with tall
grass samples across the room PROFESSOR SAPPERSTEIN
young thin and bearded is studying them

CARRIE
Okay thanks

She crosses to him --

CARRIE (contd)
Sapperstein

He looks at her --

SAPPERSTEIN
Yeah

CARRIE
Wanted to see me

His face tenses -- this is serious

SAPPERSTEIN
-- Follow me

He leads her to a bench in the corner on which stands a
GLASS HERBARIUM containing only STALKS and a few HEAT
LAMPS One of the GLASS PANELS has been smashed

SAPPERSTEIN (contd)
They took it all

CARRIE
All what

SAPPERSTEIN
Cannabis Sativa

She looks at him --

SAPPERSTEIN (contd)
My weed man Ive been growing
it all summer and they took it
(BEAT)
It was just budding too

He sends an evil glare across the room to four glassy-
eyed scientists sitting around a desk munching on potato
chips candy bars and drinking beer Stifling laughter

SAPPERSTEIN (contd)
(GLARING)
Its not funny

Carrie looks back to him -- can barely stifle a laugh

CARRIE
Professor Sapperstein Id like
you to read something for me

She pulls out a small LEATHER FOLD chained around her
neck Opens it up Puts it in front of his face

CARRIE (contd)
Whats this say

Hes not sure what shes getting at --

CARRIE (contd)
Cmon go ahead read it

SAPPERSTEIN
Carrie Stetko
CARRIE
Keep reading
SAPPERSTEIN

United States Marshal
She closes the fold lets it drop around her neck

CARRIE
Very good
(BEAT)
Now are you still sure you want to
report the theft of an illegal
narcotic

He actually ponders the question for a moment Carrie
puts an arm around his bony shoulder and steers him away
from the others

CARRIE (contd)
Professorare you planning on
doing the winter-over

SAPPERSTEIN
Not this year no

CARRIE
Good And how are you feeling
right now

SAPPERSTEIN
You think Im crazy Is that what
youre saying

CARRIE
(PACIFYING)
No no not crazy But this time
of year down here were all
going a little toasty arent we
How about you plant a little
Cannabis when you get home

She pats him on the back

INT MARSHALS OFFICE - MCMURDO - DAY

Carrie enters Walks by a mirror Takes a glance Is
about to fix her hair then stares at the reflection --
whats the point We notice a slight scar on her right
temple

She steps around the moving boxes to her desk which is
bare except for a thick BINDER labelled ‘DAILY REPORTS’

She takes a seat opens a binder and flips past dozens of
empty pages reading INCIDENT None ACTION TAKEN

None On todays page she fills in the blanks with
Theft of botany sample And None

A pencil falls down onto the desk before her Bounces
Then rolls off She doesnt even flinch or look up
Just stares unhappily at the binder

Camera tilts up -- several pencils are stuck into the
cardboard tiles

She closes the binder and puts it on the shelf beside a

row of framed photos Carrie in a Marshals uniform

graduation day crisp clean uniform She and two other

girlfriends all smiles at a bar -- shes got a birthday

cake in front of her Carrie on a beach somewhere

sitting in a chair feet in the sand -- shaded by a palm

As she lifts the frames and moves to pack them in a
nearby box --

MURPHY (0C)
You busy

She turns to see SAM MURPHY base commander the guy on
the DART BOARD Theres an awkward beat

CARRIE
What do you think
(BEAT)
I know you werent in the area
Whats up
He sees the photo on the dart board -- saunters over to
it
MURPHY

I got a pilot at ASB who thinks he
spotted a popsicle out on the ice

CARRIE

MURPHY
Dont know
CARRIE
And we were doing so well
(BEAT)

He takes a closer look at the photo -- almost seems
amused

MURPHY

He looks at her with a smile --

MURPHY (contd)
You leaving the dart board

Keller half smiles

KELLER

KELLER
Heres an idea -- why dont you

INT OPERATIONS CENTER - ASB

A large room by base standards Several windows A

giant map of ANTARCTICA dominates one wall with the
International stations and research outposts flagged with
pins that have their countries flags on them A grid of
EVAC TIMES of each STATION and OUTPOST is next to it A
Tech is changing a few
Another TECH sits as a console lined with comm equipment
and computers Others hustle about

Talking into a headset is the Station Manager RHONDA
STEWART (30s) Silky white skin Irish Long red hair
tied back Perfunctory

RHONDA
Ill have them boomerang back and
pick up the load -- just have it
ready

The Tech at the console turns to her --

TECH
Guys got the science lab all shut
down

RHONDA

Good have them check all the
pressure levels on the hydraulics
then clear the exterior storage
bins Make sure were not leaving
anything out there

Rhonda sees Carrie coming in the doorway Theres a
flash of awkward tension that both mask with professional
demeanor

RHONDA (CONTD)
Sam told me youd be coming up --
hows the sleigh ride

CARRIE
Fine I need a plane and that
pilot who saw the popsicle

RHONDA
Ill have him meet you in the

EXT BACK OF ASB - DAY

Selecting a putter from a bag of golf clubs is DOC FURY
60 Looks seasoned Bearded Wears the only non-red

parka weve seen its royal blue trimmed with black fur
and emblazoned with dozens of emblems and patches from
years of Antarctic service

Doc
In less than three days we begin
Winter-over The sky will go
completely black and stay that way
for six months

Camera pulls back to REVEAL five NEWBIES (first-timers)
an Asian French Brazilian Danish and an American All
are standing on their jackets shivering uncontrollably
in the wind

DOC (contd)
The sane ninety percent of the
population will be leaving the
ice Extreme weather conditions
make it impossible for planes from
the outside world to land You
have chosen for your own
misguided reasons to stay And
it is my responsibility to teach
you beakers how not to die

Doc lines up on a hot pink golf ball and putts

The ball rolls across the glacier in an impossible wind-
driven arc approaches a flag and sinks

DOC (contd)

Time
The Asian holds a stopwatch He stares at it stupidly
ASIAN
T T Three minutes

Doc
Your core body temperatures have
fallen to approximately 97
degrees You are shivering
uncontrollably -- losing basic
motor skills Youre having
trouble focusing on even the
simplest tasks In short you are
well on your way to dying and it
has only been two-hundred seconds

(BEAT)

Put your coats on

The class struggles into their jackets Doc assists
those who in their diminished capacity are having
trouble figuring out how to put them on

DOC (contd)
Your life is dependent on your
awareness of the weather So be
aware There is a condition that
arises around here known as a
whiteout Dont get caught in it
Winds kick up snow thats lain on
the ice for thousands of years --
cant see six inches in front of
your nose Temperature plummets
to triple digits We found bodies
less than a foot from safety and
warmth

Carrie walks up Docs eyes brighten

DOC (contd)
Class here we have another of the
many hazards found on Antarctica
Say hello to Marshal Stetko

Through a disjointed chattering chorus --

CLASS
Hello Marshal Stetko

Doc
Always a pleasure to see you
Unlike most of the beaker-heads
down here
(BEAT)
Social visit
CARRIE

I wish -- We got a job I need
you to take a ride with me
(MORE )

CARRIE (contd)
(BEAT)
Might be a body out on the ice
Doc
Whys this crap always happen at
the end of the season
Carrie pulls a Driver from Docs golf bag Lines up
another pink ball
DOC (contd)
Too cold for driving
Carrie swings -- WHACK The ball shatters and pink bits

rain down around them

CARRIE
So it is

INT ASB - HANGAR - DAY

Carrie and Doc cross the interior which houses Three
double prop Twin Otters two Snowcats and six
snowmobiles Keller and two other employees are busy
working on one of the Otters

Doc
Whats your gut say about this
body

CARRIE

My gut and I dont talk anymore
They continue after a beat --

CARRIE (contd)
I saw your boxes packed up What
was all that BS last month about
Im never going back -- Ill die
here Scatter my ashes over the
pole
He takes a beat --

Doc
People change Carrie

CARRIE
Not you

Doc
I got a card from my Granddaughter

met her

CARRIE
Or mentioned her A grandchild

Doc
It got me thinking -- I need to be
a better Grandfather than I was a
father Its time I deal with my
life Ive been down here a lot
longer than I probably should
have

They arrive at one of the Otters

BYRON DELFY a baby-faced African American pilot leans
out the planes door

CARRIE

DELFY
Yes maam

Delfy smiles graciously
DELFY

Delfy disappears back into the plane Doc looks to
Carrie
boc

INT TWIN OTTER - AIRBORNE - SAME

The plane soars through a cloudless sky the sun
sparkling brilliantly on the endless ice sheet below

Carries in the copilots seat wrapped up tight in her
ECW just trying to stay warm Delfys at the controls
Docs in the back

CARRIE
What were you doing out there

DELFY
I went to evac a camp Had to fly
off route to get around a storm
Got down low to avoid some
turbulence and there it was

Carrie notices a picture of a young boy around seven
wearing a Yankees cap dangling from the instrument panel
Its framed in popsicle sticks with I LOVE YOU DADDY
written around the perimeter

CARRIE
That your son

He lights up

DELFY
Yeah names Nathan

CARRIE
Hes cute Has your eyes

DELFY
Lucky he got his mommas brain
Kids smart

CARRIE
So why arent you with him

DELFY

house Give my boy a yard His
own room Stuff I never had

He looks at Carrie all bundled up

DELFY (contd)
Dont like the cold huh

CARRIE
Hate it

DELFY
Then why are you down here

Carries eyes drift out the window --

CARRIE
We all make stupid mistakes

Delfy tips the nose of the plane down The ice below is
broken by jagged hills and yawning crevasses

DELFY
Its right up here
He spirals down among the icy hills visibility is poor
Heavy turbulence suddenly jars the plane sideways --
Delfy laughs at Docs nervous reaction

DELFY (contd)
I dont carry extra panties Doc
so keep it tight
(BEAT)
There it is

He banks the plane and slips down into a valley

DELFY (contd)
Three oclock

CARRIE
Yeah Got it Its a popsicle
alright

Down below is the body sprawled on the icy ground next to
the crevice

CARRIE (contd)
Red jacket Hes American

EXT ICE FIELD - LATER

The Twin Otter is in the distant background Carrie Doc
and Delfy who has a gear bag slung over his shoulder
weave their way around huge ice boulders -- skirt small
crevasses Mid-conversation

Doc
Its always different when
they freeze Some curl up Some
stretch out Some tear their
clothes off They get delirious
What was that guys name

CARRIE
Linger

DOC
Yeah Hes lost in a storm We
cant find him but we hear him on
the radio going on and on about
the Serengeti heat and his wife
Janet Next day we find him
frozen solid wearing nothing but
his bunny boots

Delfy stops Grimaces Drops the gear bag

DELFY
Jesus

The CORPSE is just ahead -- a frozen display of death

They all stare at it - the body in unnatural angles the
spiderweb of frozen blood Delfy looks nauseous

Doc
Never seen a dead guy

Delfy slowly shakes his head no

Carrie moves up to it Takes a look down the deep
crevice four feet away Cant see the bottom She walks
around to get a look at the face Blanches slightly

DOC (contd)
You know him --

CARRIE
So do you Think his names
Weiss We Wintered-over last year
with him Played cards a couple
of times

Doc
The guy who cheated

CARRIE
Yeah Geologist I think
Doc takes a look

Doc

Damn --
Carrie pulls out a DIGITAL CAMERA from a pocket Shoots
a couple of pics

Doc takes a look up behind them The ice steepens
sharply to a vast plateau scattered with jagged boulders
of ice

DOC (contd)
Looks like he fell from up there

Carrie pauses with her camera looks up -- doesnt seem
as convinced

CARRIE
Then wheres his crampons -- his
gear
Doc looks around -- shes right
Doc

Maybe down the crevasse

CARRIE
Yeah maybe --

Carrie glances to Delfy

CARRIE (contd)
Whats the closest camp

DELFY
Brits -- about eighty miles west

CARRIE
(looking at body - Soto)
What the hell where you doing all
the way out here

Doc reaches down and tries to move the body -- doesnt
budge -- frozen solid into the ice
boc
Ah Christ -- hes a sticker
Carrie unzips the gear bag Digs out ice two axes
TIME CUT

LATER

A pile of chopped ice is off to the side of corpse
Delfy who looks very uneasy about all this grabs the
feet as Carrie and Doc each grab an arm

CARRIE
You going to be alright

DELFY
No -- this is the kind of stuff

that scars you for life

They all strain to lift the body from the frozen ground

boc
Gonna give myself a Goddamn
hernia
They keep pulling and -- SNAP The arm Doc is holding

BREAKS OFF at the elbow Lands on his ass
Delfy turns away and pukes
CARRIE

Oh yeah -- Im really going to
miss this place

LOUD MUSIC A party is in progress People are
mingling some have drinks others dance

The VOLUME of the music dies replaced by a repetitive
SQUEAKING NOISE emanating through the silence
People stop what theyre doing and focus on where the
noise is coming from which is --

-- Doc and Carrie ushering a pushcart with Weiss
contorted frozen body through the middle of the party
His dismembered arm rests across his chest

The festive mood evaporates quickly as all eyes stay
glued to the horrific state of Weiss body

Just as they pass OPERATIONS Rhonda steps out with the
Brazilian and French Newbies at her side to see whats

going on Her eyes immediately go to Weiss then shift

to meet Carries Before she can say anything --

CARRIE (contd)
How long to thaw him out

boc
Carrie lets just bag him and put
him on a plane to McMurdo

She moves over to a sink and gets a cup of steaming hot
water from a tap

CARRIE
It bothers me no ones reported
him missing yet
Doc
Because maybe no one thinks he is

CARRIE
Howd he get out there There
were no tracks

Doc
Sounds to me like you and your gut
are talking again

Carrie returns with the water Goes to pour it on the
zipper but Doc gently puts his hand on hers stopping
her
DOC (contd)
Lets ask ourselves if we really
need to do this
They share a moment Carrie understanding but --
CARRIE
Nobody wants to get out of here

water on the zipper

Doc watches as she tries to pry it open further but
cant

off the ice Right now we dont
have to say a word When they
find something later -- hey we
didnt know We were leaving the

with exposed pipes and wiring

Gaunt malnourished faces look up from the rooms they
pass All stare Silently Looks more like death row

INT VOSTOK - OPERATIONS ROOM - DAY

Carrie enters a grungy operations room that never made it
out of the 70s ancient computers and steel-cased radios
fill one wall

One man welds equipment off to the side Four more
Russians sit at a table playing cards and drinking Vodka

They all take their time looking her over

Yuri smiles

YURI
So many people come through
Vostok Is hard to remember

CARRIE

Carrie hoists her duffel bag on the table and unzips it

Yuri pulls it open Its packed with steaks The
Russians react with smiles and the mood lightens Yuris
grin widens further Takes out a porno -- theres a
Cheerleader on the cover

YURI
Mister Mooney yes I remember
now He offers pay us to fly him
off Antarctica on our transport
We give him very good price -
because plane leaves a week ago

The Russians laugh

INT VOSTOK - COAT ROOM - DAY

Carrie is suiting up in her ECW gear rope harness and
crampons Her jackets open Delfy has a steaming cup
of coffee in his hand He looks to her gear belt cuffs
pepper spray baton

DELFY
You dont carry a gun

CARRIE
Against the law -- Antarcticas

DELFY
Doesnt that make you feel kind of
naked
CARRIE
All this crap on -- I prefer
naked
She zips up her jacket He glances to a temp readout by
the door
DELFY

Gettin worse Minus eighty-one
Wind at a hundred and ten knots

He takes a sip from his hot coffee

CARRIE
Do you have to do that in front of
me

He sees that one of her leg straps on her harness needs
to be fastened

DELFY
Give you a hand

CARRIE
Sure

Sets down his coffee on a nearby shelf As he fastens
it Carrie pulls on her goggles and a face mask They
finish at the same time

DELFY
Ever been on a rope-line in a
whiteout

CARRIE
Nope Thoughts

DELFY
Yeah hold on tight

Delfy leaves as Carrie cranks the submarine-type wheel-
lock in the center of the door

WHAM The door is suddenly yanked from her grasp
slamming open against the building Wind knocks her
back

The storm sings in an even DULL ROAR A solid white wall
of wind-driven ice blows past The light is oddly dim

CRACK The coffee mug Delfy left on the shelf breaks in
half exposing a cylinder of frozen coffee It rolls
across the shelf falls and shatters on the floor

Carrie struggles back to the door and clips a three-foot
tether from her harnesses to a RED STORM LINE attached to
the side of the building

She steps into the storm

EXT WHITEOUT - THE LINE - CONTINUOUS

Carrie leans into the door pushing it closed and locking
the wheel

Two steps into the storm the building behind her is
gone Step after step theres nothing but the guide
line and the ROAR of the storm

A gust of wind lifts her off the ground Shes caught by
her tether and smacked down on the ice

Slowly regaining her stance she pushes onward Finally
Carrie runs into something It takes her a moment to

realize shes at a building

She grabs the wheel-lock and turns breaking ice opening
the door

INT OUTLYING BUILDING - READY ROOM - CONTINUOUS
Unclipping from the line she closes the door on the
HOWLING behind her Pulls off her mask Teeth are

chattering

She spins the wheel-lock of the door going out of the
ready room into the building

CUT TO

INT OUTLYING BUILDING - HALLWAY - RIGHT AFTER

Carrie hits the lights nothing No power Just a
sliver of light stabbing in through a window

CARRIE
(calling out)
Mooney Hello
Only silence responds
The hallway is long and dark leading away from her in
both directions She draws a flashlight from her pocket
Thumbs the switch sending a beam out through the dark

Something doesnt feel right Slides her baton out from
her belt She decides to go left

Walking the hall she tries door after door Finally one
gives

CARRIE (contd)
Mooney

She cautiously pushes it open four stripped bunks in an
empty room

Moves on down the corridor -- hears COUGHING like
someone trying to clear their throat

Looks ahead and determines its coming from behind a
closed door at the end of the hall

Its confirmed when she hears it again

Stops at the door
She slowly opens it --
Now she can hear HEAVY LABORED BREATHING --
( )

-- Sweeps the inside with her light Its a large lounge
type room scattered chairs tables and an overturned
sofa on the other side -- where the heavy breathings
coming from Another cough

She enters the room

INSIDE THE LOUNGE - CONTINUOUS

Inching forward she gets to the sofa Looks over it to
see A BODY -- its Mooney lying in a pool of blood
Struggling to breathe through a puncture wound to his
esophagus

CARRIE
My God

She goes to him As she kneels he grabs her GASPING
for air trying to tell her something

Carrie catches a REFLECTION OF MOMENT behind her in his
eyes -- someones coming at her

-- She instinctively rolls back over Mooney just as --
WHAM An ICE AXE swings down at her Just misses her
head by an inch but the shaft nails her arm holding the
baton that goes clattering across the floor

The killer wearing ECW gear with hood and goggles takes
another swing She lunges to the side Axe misses her

but sinks into Mooney Game over for him

Carrie slices the floor with her light looking for the
baton but cant see it

The killer yanks his axe free of Mooney as Carrie bolts
around the sofa heading back out the door

INT OUTLYING BUILDING - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
Carrie blows back into the hallway at a full tilt run
retracing her steps Her light zigzags The killer
emerges a few beats later on a run Its going to be
close

Halfway down the hall she hangs a hard right toward the
Ready Room Throws a glance over her shoulder -- hes
right behind

She targets the ready room door -- the orb of her light
getting smaller and smaller as she nears

Gets there Doesnt even want to look back -- its all
or nothing She pulls open the door --

INT OUTLYING BUILDING - READY ROOM - CONTINUOUS
-- Leaping in she spins the wheel-lock closed
SMACK The killer HITS THE DOOR from the other side

She SPINS OPEN the outside door wheel-lock as the lock
on the INNER DOOR behind her starts SPINNING OPEN at the
same time Its a race

CARRIES door slams open first and the wind hits her
hard

She pulls on her mask and goggles just as the door behind
her bursts open

EXT WHITEOUT - CONTINUOUS

Carrie jumps into the whiteout catching the red storm
line and clipping in as she staggers forward Glancing
back she sees the killer in the doorway then loses
sight of him as shes swallowed in the whiteout

She struggles down the line buffeted by the storm but
HER HAND ON THE LINE moves erratically -- Hes on

She swivels a nervous whirl to see -- the Killer
materializing out of the whiteout right behind her Hes
clipped into Carries line He raises the axe
He swings She jumps back losing her footing Hits the
ice hard -- face first The killer towers over her
raising the axe again Carrie drives her heel into his
nee knocking him off balance He drops next to her

He reaches for Carrie grabbing her mask pulling it off
She cries out as the FREEZING WIND catches her face

The killer gets to his feet and delivers a rib-cracking
ick flipping Carrie onto her back

SOUND FADES from Carries world

There is nothing but her strained BREATHING The killer
draws back the axe shiny with frozen blood He swings

Carrie UNCLIPS her harness from the tether THE WIND
grabs her and Carrie SLIDES AWAY -- the killer
disappearing from view behind the swirling wall of white

Sliding across the ice Carrie SLAMS into a pole Grabs
on

EXT WHITEOUT - POLE - CONTINUOUS

Cinching her hood down she searches the storm with no
idea which way to go

Carrie glances up the post Barely visible through the
blowing ice are signs pointing different directions
Moscow 17030 Tokyo 13329 Fiji 7877 Los Angeles
15641

She pulls herself up and heads out leaning into the
wind Carrie staggers blindly trying to protect her
face Falling she gets up and struggles on

Her drunken gait increases as she continues to lose heat
A rope catches her in the neck Its another storm line
EXT WHITEOUT - SECOND LINE - CONTINUOUS

Carrie lurches forward holding the line with one arm

Finally she bumps into something It moves It turns
to face her ITS THE KILLER AGAIN He swings She

TO

deflects the blow with her free arm and manages to grab
the axe head The killer tears the axe free taking
Carries glove with it

He swings again but Carrie pulls hard on the rope
throwing him off balance

The axe cuts through the line The killer hits the
ground and is immediately ushered away in the wind as
Carrie clinging to the rope slides over the ice like a
pendulum

The line goes tight shes jerked to a stop It takes
everything shes got to get to her feet She slowly
struggles up the line

EXTINT STORAGE SHED - CONTINUOUS

More dead than alive Carrie stumbles against the door
and grabs the wheel-lock with both hands

Unable to bend the frozen fingers of her left hand around

the wheel she struggles to turn it Finally it gives

The door swings wide and she stumbles in But shes
caught her bare hand frozen to the metal

Ripping it free her SCREAM is lost to the wind

Carrie falls collapsing against the door Blackout

SMASH CUT

INT MOTEL 6 - BATHROOM - NIGHT (CARRIES MEMORY HIT)

A single bulb above casts a cone of light down onto
Carrie whos leaning against a sink staring at herself
in a mirror She looks stressed Her Marshals badge
dangles around her neck Wears a shoulder harness The
bathroom door behind her is open

She catches a REFLECTION of a shadow moving across the
room behind her Body tenses

As she turns --

CARRIE

No answer
She withdraws a 9mm from her harness -- eases toward the
door
Gun ready she rolls her back around the jam -- WHAM

Carries blindsided by a fist that drives her into the
other door jam

Before she can recover -- a guy dark eyes unshaven
grabs her by the hair and runs her head first into the
bathroom mirror SMASH Its brutal Shards fall into
the sink as Carries RIGHT TEMPLE goes bloody She
drops to the floor --

Shes still got some fight in her -- hands lash out ina

florescent lights A HUGE BRUISE runs across her arm

Moves her light around -- searching Passes over the

dead people Now Im at two

Carrie gets on her knees -- looks under the sofa

Low angles her light Something reflects Reaches in
Retrieves her baton --

INT OUTLYING BUILDING - HALLWAY - RIGHT AFTER
Just as Carrie and Delfy leave the lounge her perifocal
vision picks up a wisp of light from a flashlight which

bled out from a doors threshold halfway down the hall

Delfys eyes go wide -- Carries finger goes to her mouth
- Shhhhh

She instinctively pulls her baton with her left hand but
it hurts She shifts it to the other

She turns off her light Delphy does the same Motions
for him to stay put

She heads to the source keeping her baton ready and her
back tight to the wall

Gets to the edge of the door Its open just slightly -
looks in

Sees a man in an ECW jacket with his back to her holding

a flashlight in one hand and digging through a duffle bag

with his other Items are strewn Another bag has been
completely turned inside out

She enters Baton cocked

She stops
CARRIE
Dont take this personally but I

Patrons and bystanders are perched in various locations

Delfy pulls to a stop They exit the cat

Nothing

EXT ICE FIELD - DAY

All three get cold-cocked by an invisible wind Carrie
steps away from the Cat Pryce does too

Her eyes scan the ice with cool appraisal Its
completely flat Desert like

PRYCE
You sure this is right

CARRIE
Section 104 These are the
coordinates

DELFY

Maybe you wrote them down wrong

Carrie ignores him Walks further away from the cat
Ice CRUNCHES UNDER HER FEET as she keeps looking -- then
she stops Somethings not right Looks DOWN

Kneels to the ice Scoops some up Checks it out
Perplexed Pryce approaches from behind

CARRIE
This is shaved ice
( )

She gets to her feet Walks further -- her eyes now

paying close attention to the texture of the ice After
a dozen steps texture changes Ice is now smooth --
like its supposed to be

She turns around Tries to get the bigger picture
Looks at the ground all around her Realizes a large
area has been blanketed with shaved pieces of ice a few
inches thick --

CARRIE (contd)
They were digging Pryce And
they tries to spread the ice to
hide it

She heads back across the area Scans the horizon
Takes another step forward
WHOOSH In an instant Carries gone DISAPPEARS below
the ice Only a four foot wide hole remains that was
covered up with a white iced-over tarp

Pryce and Delfy move toward her -- each hesitating
slightly unsure of their own footing

Pryce gets to the hole Looks down Carrie is
precariously dangling in an ICE SHAFT that slopes at a
slight angle Shes managed to grasp a protruding piece
of ice but shes fighting the pain in her left hand to
hold on It slips off Below her -- nothing but
darkness

CARRIE (contd)
Grab me

Pryce lays flat Reaches his hand down -- six inches too
short Delfy appears from behind

PRYCE

Hold my legs

Delfy does Pryce inches closer

As she slowly turns to get her bearings her light falls
on an ESCAPE HATCH of some kind maybe three feet high

Carrie shines the light to her feet The ground
beneath
her is metal
INT ICE SHAFT - RIGHT AFTER

lights Find themselves staring intoAN AIRPLANE

Off their lights -- every surface scintillates with ice
crystals from the frozen atmosphere undisturbed except
for recent tracks of footprints filing in and out -- they
go forward and aft disappearing into darkness Place is

Twisted and strewn with large containers scattered at
odd angles -- victims of an intense IMPACT The plane is
pitched up at the nose making their footing precarious

CARRIE
Cargo plane but I dont recognize
it

DELFY

Its an Antanov-74 Russian made -

these in the air for forty years

Carrie shuffles her way forward into the darkness
heading for the cockpit

Something BRUSHES her leg She spins Shines her light -

- which illuminates a HAND fingers in a clawed position -
- as if in excruciating pain She whips her light past

the hand up the arm -- captures the FACE of a man

staring at her It takes a moment to realize -- hes

dead pinned between two large metal crates

Delfy stands still Staring Carrie throws a look
over her shoulder --

targets the cockpit door Its closed

across a SHATTERED WINDSHIELD -- chunks of ice protruding
through it

Continues over three dead men in flight suits still
strapped into seats their broken bodies and ghastly
expressions perfectly preserved Each have a sidearm
holstered around their waist

DELFY
This isnt funny --

She looks back to Delfy -- gets confused
CARRIE
Wheres Pryce

INT CARGO BAY - RIGHT AFTER

Trailing her beam of light Carrie and Delfy climb
through a thick wall of nylon webbing Enter a cluttered
cargo area

Ransacked Antarctic gear is strewn everywhere in a tangle
of ropes and crampons old ECW gear and boxes of
supplies

Dipping into a case of bottles Delfy pulls one free
sniffs and drinks

CARRIE
What is that

Delfy grins

DELFY
Vodka

Carrie continues through the hold Her FLASHLIGHT BEAM
flickers over more chaos of the crash HUGE STEEL TANKS
TAKE UP MOST OF THE MID-SECTION

Spots Pryces flashlight holding on something just ahead
Moves to it

CARRIE
(SUSPICIOUS)
Find what youre looking for

Her light hits Pryce who is focused on a HEAVY STEEL
CAGE WELDED INTO THE AIRFRAME Incredibly strong And
inside it is a STEEL SAFE Door is open

Pryce takes a beat -- turns to she and Delfy

PRYCE
Just answers
(BEAT)
Those are fuel tanks behind you
This plane was outfitted for long
range capabilities

CARRIE
And by the looks of that safe
mustve been transporting
something pretty important

Carrie moves in closer Sees that the cage has been
breached

Part of it has been damaged by the crash and this
weakness has been ruthlessly attacked by the previous
intruders until they forced an opening Discarded tools
litter the floor

PRYCE
They put some serious work into
this

Theres a pool of frozen blood near the opening -- where
one of the torn jagged bars of the steel cage is covered
in blood --

CARRIE
Whoever got hurt they dragged him
out of here Theres blood all
over the tunnel

She uses her light to examine the interior of the safe
more closely -- the frost on the shelves exposes SIX
ROUND RUST RINGS where containers have been removed

Each one roughly measuring a foot tall four inches wide

The PLANE SUDDENLY TREMBLES

CARRIE (contd)
What is that

The muffled ROAR of a diesel

DELFY
Its the Cat
CRASH -- the unmistakable sound of FALLING ICE
CARRIE

Go
CRASHCRASHCRASH More ICE

They scramble back through the darkness the flashlight
beams swinging wildly about the hold

MORE ICE FALLS Its getting louder as theyre getting
closer to the source

Carrie targets ahead with her light -- illuminates the
hatch as A LOAD OF ICE DROPS IN covering it completely
Light fades

DELFY
Sonofabitch

The continual sound of falling ice grows MUFFLED and
DISTANT

Carrie and Pryce both pull out their phones

CARRIE
No signal you

Shakes his head no

CARRIE (contd)
Someone followed us

INT PLANE - AT THE HATCH - LATER
CHIPCHIPCHIP Ice is flying

Things are desperate as a single flashlight beam propped
up on a crate illuminates Carrie Delfy and Pryce hard
at it -- frantically chopping away at the ice filled
hatch with pieces of scrap metal from the plane Efforts
are big-- but the progress minimal

PRYCE
This isnt going to work its
like digging through concrete with
a spoon
(BEAT)
Were going to suffocate before we
get out here
CARRIE
How long do you figure weve got

PRYCE
Three of us down here -- 12 15
hours at the most

Delfy looks at him with the intensity of a trapped
animal

DELFY
No way Im not going out like
this No way

The light from the flashlight slowly begins to fade
Carrie goes over to the crate slaps it against her leg
trying to get more juice going Still fading Light
goes out --

-- Screen goes black Cant see a thing A second

later ANOTHER LIGHT KICKS ON -- Pryce is holding it
Hands it over to Carrie --

DELFY (contd)
And when that one goes -- were

screwed

Carries mind whirls with her lack of options then --

CARRIE
What about the Vodka -- we could
make some torches maybe melt the
ice

PRYCE

Fire will burn the 02 quicker

CARRIE
What choice do we have

Pryce knows shes right

Delfy looks to them both Desperate
DELFY
Dont need my vote

Pryce heads to the back his body becoming barely visible
in the dissipating range of light

Carrie takes a six-inch pearl handled Buck knife from a
pocket unfolds it-- starts cutting the liner of her
coat

Delfy moves to a nearby wooden crate Goes to lift it
but its frozen to the floor Stomps on it It breaks
Pulls pieces from the siding for torch sticks

Pryce comes back with a couple bottles Stops dead in
his tracks

Carrie looks over to see him staring at two LIFE JACKETS
attached to the wall near the hatch Hes thinking

He moves to Carrie --

PRYCE
Hold these

He exchanges the bottles for her flashlight

He shines the light to the ceiling as he heads toward the
back leaving Carrie and Delfy getting swallowed in the
dark

CARRIE
Whatre you doing

PRYCE
All these planes used to have bail-
out hatches

CARRIE
We came in through it

Pryce goes back into the cargo area

PRYCE (0C)
Has to be more than one

DELFY
Itd be on the ceiling in case of
an ocean landing

Carrie watches Pryces flashlight moving about in the
cargo area of the aircraft

PRYCE
Found it

Carrie and Delfy get to Pryce They follow his beam
straight up to expose an ESCAPE HATCH in the roof of the
fuselage

PRYCE (contd)
With the angle of the plane I
dont think were that far from
the surface Give me a hand

Pryce moves to a large crate -- starts to push it over
They join sliding it over below the hatch

He jumps up onto it -- examines the hatch area

PRYCE (contd)
These are explosive bolts If we
blow the hatch maybe itll smash
a hole up through the ice

CARRIE
Or if the ice is too thick the
blast will come right back at us

PRYCE
We can be blown up suffocate or
freeze to death Take your pick

Pryce hands Carrie the flashlight She targets the hatch
area as he opens an electrical panel beside it a
crisscrossing maze of wires

As he reaches up to examine the wiring Carrie catches a
GLIMPSE of a SHOULDER HARNESS under his liner

PRYCE (contd)
This could work -- give me the
battery from your phone
As he looks down Carrie masks her discovery Hands over
her phone He extracts the BATTERY

PRYCE (contd)
When I connect these two wires
hopefully theres going to be a
big bang May want to take some
cover

Pryce is nervous himself as he places one selected wire
onto the battery and prepares for another

He looks to Carrie and Pryce who have backed up against
the fuselage

PRYCE (contd)
You guys ready

Delfy nods

Carrie is still running that shoulder holster through her
head

Pryce touches the last wire to the battery Nothing
happens Hope freezes

Pryce tries again --

-- KA-BOOM The hatch EXPLODES INWARD ricocheting
around the inside of the cargo hold like a giant bullet
coming in and out of their light

SLAM SLAM SLAM untilWHAM it buries itself edge-on
halfway into the fuselage missing Carrie by a hairs
width

They stand there deafened and stunned then a shower of
ice rains into the plane where the hatch used to be and a
THIN SHAFT OF LIGHT DROPS into the cargo bay like a gift
from God

DELFY
Hallelujah --

Pryce drops down Moves to another crate

PRYCE
Delfy help me with this Well
need to get up higher

Delfy moves forward to help The two of them push it
over Its a strenuous lift to get it on top of the

other

Just as they finish Pryce turns to find himself facing
Carrie holding one of the RUSSIANS GUNS TO HIS FACE

CARRIE
Dont move

Pryce stares at her in disbelief

PRYCE
Whats going on

DELFY
Yeah -- whatre you doing
CARRIE
Our friend here isnt who he says

he is

She reaches into Pryces liner pulls out his sidearm
from the shoulder holster

Switches it with the one in her hand Puts the Russian
gun in her coat pocket

CARRIE (contd)
Didnt you know its a direct
treaty violation to carry a
firearm down here

PRYCE
Ive been authorized because of
whats happened

CARRIE
Stop lying to me --

She takes out her handcuffs

CARRIE (contd)
Delfy cuff him to the wall

She holds out the cuffs
PRYCE
Dont do this

DELFY
Man the guy just saved our
lives

CARRIE
He was saving his own Do it

Delfy takes the cuffs from her Cuffs Pryce to some
exposed piping Carrie lowers her gun

CARRIE (contd)
You know what was in that safe
(BEAT)
Now who are you

She sees a moment of contemplation on Pryces face --

CARRIE (contd)
I swear Ill leave you here to
die

Beat

PRYCE
CIA

CARRIE
Have you got an ID for that too

PRYCE
Listen to me -- Forty eight hours
ago we picked up chatter between
someone down here and Tahir
Soufian a black market trader in
New York It was all about
setting up a buy for cannisters
found in an old Russian transport
buried in the ice

DELFY
Damn I knew that government
eavesdropping was true

PRYCE
Theres been rumors for years that
the Russians had a second base --

a secret weapons research facility
under the ice that supposedly blew

up in the late sixties -- nothing
was ever confirmed
(MORE )

PRYCE (contd)
The fact is before the treaty in
“72 they were strip mining all
over the place down here -- we
believe for uranium and other
specialized minerals for weapons
use It was the Cold War No one
knows half the things the
Russians were up to This plane
could be the link between rumor
and truth And if it is true
whats in those cannisters could
be a prelude to another terrorist
attack

CARRIE
Why did you lie to me

PRYCE
Look the UN carries a lot of
weight down here Think about it -
- if I had told you I was CIA
you would have been on the horn
back to Washington in no time
This is a very sensitive matter
News travels fast down here I
dont have to tell you that
(BEAT)
Besides I didnt know if I could
trust you

Carrie wrestles with her emotions She looks back
towards the open safe the blood staining the airplane

floor Makes a decision

Cut TO
EXT SURFACE - DAY

Delfy wriggles out from the hole He reaches back
Helps Carrie to the surface Pryce follows

They look around The weather has deteriorated - the sky
is dark with fast moving clouds The wind is HOWLING
The Snowcat is parked over the hole blade lowered

Delfy runs over jumps onto the CAT Looks inside the
cab

DELFY
Keys are still in it

Carrie notices a single set of an airplanes ski tracks
in the distance

CARRIE
Plane couldve gone anywhere
Theres forty-six countries here
all counting down to Winter-over
Rubin could just disappear in the
mayhem

Delfy starts up the Cat

Carrie pulls out her Nextel as Pryce takes out his PDA
She depresses the walkie button -- makes her way to the
Cat

CARRIE

Carrie clicks off

DELFY
You think Rubin might try to leave
out of McMurdo

CARRIE
He knows Im on his ass so he
might Anythings possible I
want to eliminate his options

She massages her gloved hand Looks to Pryce whos
talking on his PDA as he heads toward the Cat

PRYCE (INTO PHONE)
Six cannisters maybe four inches
in diameter about a foot high --

transported in something that
size

He looks to Carrie --

ice

He hangs up Carrie climbs in -- looks back at the

CARRIE

He was dumped from a plane

She closes the door to the Cat

INT CORRIDOR - ASB - DAY

Carrie strides along the corridor with Pryce They pass

a window where we see that an LC-130 EVAC PLANE is parked
out front -- its tail section open like the mouth of a
massive beast Move past several people balloons and
“Eve of Evac signs
Pryce sees Carrie really cradling her left hand now

PRYCE
You need to get that looked at

CARRIE

Sure thing Chief

MURPHY
We dont have enough supplies for
all of us to Winter-over if we get
stuck down here
(BEAT)
And you wonder why it didnt work
out between us

CARRIE
It didnt work Sam because you
couldnt keep your hands off every
new woman who stepped foot on the
ice down here I was stupid
enough to be one of them Now if
you could cut through your red
tape for just one second you
would realize that someones out

possibly full of Uranium and he
wants to get it into the hands of
some very bad people And Im

Carries sitting on the edge of an examination table as
Doc slowly unwraps her bandaged hand She winces from
the pain

Doc
Im worried about you Is it
going to take another attempt on
your life to get you to finally
slow down

She looks at him warmly --

CARRIE
You worry too much -- but its
what I like about you

Doc smiles continues to unravel the gauze-

CARRIE (contd)
Doc did you notice if Weiss hada

wound on his left leg

would have noticed it Why

CARRIE
Then its gotta be Rubin
(BEAT)

The gauze finally comes off revealing her middle TWO

the flesh of her palm Her ring looks strangely out of
place

CARRIE (contd)
Oh God

Doc reaches over to a nearby drawer -- takes out a
sterilized syringe packet

He opens up the packet

CARRIE
When did I go to Vostok

Doc puts the tip of the needle onto her blackened flesh

Doc
Feel that

He pushes hard -- penetrates the skin We see the worry
begin to elevate further on Carries face

CARRIE
No

Doc tries the needle in another location

Doc

Slowly shakes her head He holds her gaze evenly

Carries bag is open on the bed with the Russians gun
next to it

Shes trying to put on a clean flannel over a T-shirt
but cant button it up with only one hand Her
frustration mounts as she fights back every bit of
emotion thats trying to get out

She finally gives up -- kicks over a nearby chair that
sweeps the stuff off her bed Bag and gun go flying

Carrie slumps to the floor Silent tears

After a beat -- she notices Pryce standing in the doorway
with some PAPERS in his hand Hes looking at her
compassionately

PRYCE
I stopped by the clinic Doc
told me

Carrie nods pulling herself together swallowing her
emotion

CARRIE
Pretty tough Marshal huh

He enters Holds out her ring for her
CARRIE (contd)
(holds up hand with missing ring

really a good time

He joins her Hands over her ring Takes a seat next

her

CARRIE (contd)

PRYCE
Got Rubins face all over
Antarctica but nobodys seen him

They sit in silence together for a moment Carrie sees
the Russian pistol thats ended up on the floor close by
Picks it up Examines it like a relic

CARRIE
You ever kill anyone

PRYCE
Unfortunately

CARRIE
Anyone you ever trusted

PRYCE
No

Beat

CARRIE
I hadnt held a gun in my hand for
over two years
(LAUGHING)
Wasnt supposed to need one down
here

She looks at him --

CARRIE (contd)
You asked what I was running away
fromI came down here to forget
my partner Jack Thought it
would be better than any therapy

PRYCE
What happened

CARRIE
We were on a stakeout at a Holiday
Inn in Miami waiting for this buy
to go down I was excited wed
been after this trafficker fora
long time Thought this bust
would be my big chance to impress
the brass Anyway guys a no
show One hour went by then two -

Beat

Pryce takes it all in Not the story he expected

- nothing
(MORE)

CARRIE (contd)
Then Jack starting acting strange
Next thing I knew my face was
being rammed into a mirror My
own partner was trying to kill me
Turns out the whole bust was a set
up from the start Jack was dirty
working with the guy we were
after

CARRIE (contd)
Four years together I knew
things about him that his wife
didnt even know
(BEAT)
But he was my partner and I killed
him that night Theres no
changing that

CARRIE (contd)
Marshall service cleared me --
ruled it self-defense but I had a
real hard time getting over the
betrayal -- how little my life
meant to a guy I was willing to
take a bullet for

Carrie shifts in her chair Leans forward

CARRIE (contd)
Know what the kicker is -- Jack
thought I was close to figuring
him out Thought this hotel room
was the best place to get rid of

me -- make it look like a bust
gone bad Truth is I had no
idea

(ANGRY)

God I was young and stupid and
in way over my head

She stands Pryce joins her

She notices the papers hes holding

CARRIE (contd)
You asked me why I smell like
suntan lotion -- Jack wore Aramis
this cheap after-shave his wife
gave him Some of the guys down
here wear it -- suntan lotion is
the only thing that keeps me from
smelling it

He slowly turns her around to face him

-- its Rubin but he looks beat to shit Deep cracks

flakes on his face Desperate despondent eyes Shaky
frostbitten fingers Hes having a hard time holding it
together as he can barely get the words out

little easier He sets it down on an empty book shelf
next to him

CARRIE (contd)
Whos after you Where are the
cannisters

He stares off blankly --

RUBIN
Weiss didnt want to go through
with it Oh God How did we let

CARRIE
Its okay hes a doctor he can

It falls on deaf ears -- he goes for the knife She

tries to stop him

Rubin shoves her aside throwing her against a chair
She topples backwards

He whips open the door driving an unexpected shoulder
into Doc who gets nailed so hard he goes stumbling back
up against the wall behind him Takes the wind right out
of him Pills all over the floor

Rubin dashes off down the hallway -- its an effort

Carrie appears at the door Catches a glimpse of Rubin
disappearing down a set of side stairs

Carrie enters Its lined with several free standing
empty bookcases

Carrie enters through the connecting tunnels doorway
Not a lot of light Slows her pace Its quiet
Dormant Vacant lab stations Rooms been shut down for
the winter Eyes scan Fall upon --

-- A DOOR ACROSS THE ROOM A sign above reads READY

She takes off again slaloming her way around the lab

stations to get to the door

OTHER SIDE OF ROOM

Carrie gets to the door Pulls on the handle Wont
open Rattles Looks in through a viewing window --
sees --

-- a panicked Rubin inside grabbing ECW gear off a rack
mounted to the wall

A DIGITAL READOUT ABOVE THE EXIT DOOR READS -60
He and Carrie exchange glances

CARRIE
Rubin -- I can help you

He shakes his head

She tugs harder on the doors Stuck Looks through the
window to see hes tied them together with some climbing
rope

In that same instant a shaft of brilliant daylight floods
half the room as the outside door is whipped open

A MAN in full ECW - stands in the doorway Hes wearing
a FACE MASK and GOGGLES Holds an ICE AXE poised ready
to strike -- its the same guy who attacked her

Rubin bolts back toward the door separating he and
Carrie but --
-- SWOOOSH THE ICE AXE is buried into his shoulder
gaffing him like a fish The pains excruciating for
Rubin who spins on his attacker like a wild man
BULLDOZES into him driving him back out the door

Both TUMBLE down a steep set of stairs -- the exposed end
of the ice axe gets stuck in a steps steel meshing on
the way down -- rips out of Rubins shoulder

EXT READY ROOM - BASE OF STAIRS - CONTINUOUS

Rubin eats the pain as he gets to his feet Takes off
Runs blindly with panting intensity verging on hysteria
Disappears around the contour of ASB before the other guy
can get to his feet

His assailant rises Goes back up a couple steps to
retrieve his embedded ice axe but finds it wedged so
tight it wont budge Abandons it

INT SCIENCE BUILDING - SAME

Carrie shoulders the door but still doesnt budge
Hears FOOTSTEPS BEHIND HER Turns to see its Pryce

Pryce latches on to a heavy SUPPLY CART filled with
beakers micro-scopes and other gear thats tucked

against one of the lab stations

CARRIE (contd)
Pryce its not Rubin --

Off his confused look --

Pryce picks up speed as he targets the door Hits it
like a freight train busting it open Cart goes
crashing Contents scatter like buckshot

INT READY ROOM - CONTINUOUS

The two of them are hit with icy cold coming in through
the open exit door

Carrie throws a look outside -- bottom of stairs are
vacant Ice axe is still there

CARRIE

Rubin staggers as he follows a line of storage bins
tucked against the base of the main building The blood
from his wound already frozen on his shirt

The cold -- its killing him Bodys shaking The suns
reflection off the ice is blinding

Cut TO

RUBINS POV -

-- His vision begins to cloud as the corneas are
literally being burned by the intense light He tries to
shield them -- has little effect

He looks over his shoulder -- gets a BLURRED IMAGE of his
attacker not far behind

Rubin trips Hands go to the icy ground to protect his
fall Still hits hard Starts to get up but his palms
are frozen to the surface Doesnt have time to care --
pulls hard tearing the skin right off Stands Spins
around in a panicked whirl -- hes lost ground

Continues to the end of the storage bins Moves under
ASB using the enormous HYDRAULIC LIFT COLUMNS to conceal
his movement

EXT UNDERNEATH ASB - CONTINUOUS

Up ahead -- forty yards away -- hope He continues

toward some storage containers and the SNOW MELTER on the
other side where TWO PEOPLE CLAD IN ECW are finishing
filling an insulated container with water from an
insulated hose mounted to the Melter A snowmobile is
parked next to them

He tries to scream but only a dull raspy muffled voice
escapes

RUBIN
-Help me

The guys -- oblivious

Rubins pace is slowing -- hes exerting himself to get
to the people as they climb into snowmobile with the
container Frostbite is chewing up his lungs Hes too
slow they take off He coughs up blood

He turns around to check on his pursuer Twenty feet
away and closing

Rubins eyes desperately search for some kind of weapon --

anything Sees the insulated hose on the SNOW MELTER
Heads for it

EXT ASB - OTHER SIDE - SAME
Carrie passes a gap between storage containers where
several snow shovels are stuck into a mound of snow --

but he doesnt have the strength to turn it on Throws a
defeated glance over his shoulder to see --

-- THE VILLAIN in ECW gear right on him Shoves Rubin
against the tank Grabs the hose from him Turns it on -
- SPRAYING him head to toe

Rubins clothes turn to ice One eye freezes shut Lips
go cobalt blue He tries to escape but several stiff
steps away he slows and finally stops a prisoner in his
ice-locked clothing

The man moves to Rubin Grabs his head and - SNAP -
breaks his neck

Rubins body topples stiffly to the ground

They each take his jacket by the shoulder -- pull him
back over to the Snow Melter

CARRIE (contd)
Keep him still

She hands the shovel to Pryce who puts it to Kellers
neck

Carrie pulls her Buck knife from her back pocket then
whips off Kellers gloves Tosses them aside The cold
makes him more coherent Sees Pryce at this throat

PRYCE
Whos Tahir selling it to --
whats the intended target

Keller shifts his attention to Carrie whos using her
knife to SLICE open his ECW jacket and pants exposing
bare arms and legs

KELLER
Whatre you doing you crazy
bitch

Keller instantly starts to shake

CARRIE
Why did you kill those scientists
Keller Was a four-way split too
much for you

KELLER
Fuck you

Carrie grabs the hose from the Snow Melter

She brutally stomps on Kellers exposed arm douses him
with water from the hose welding his arm to the ground
as it freezes instantly

CARRIE
Where is the uranium

KELLER
(almost smug)
You have no idea whats going on

heads toward an Otter

INT TWIN OTTER - HANGAR - DAY

Delfy reaches in and gets his sons picture which is
still hanging on the console Then something catches
his attention through the windshield of his plane He
sees a FUEL HOSE running to another plane -- and its
pumping

Curious he gets out of the Otter Eyes dart about the
hangar Doesnt see anyone Heads to the other plane
Discovers that a door is open on the other side Takes a
another look around Doesnt see anyone Moves closer

Gets to the plane Takes a look inside and --
THUD Hes nailed with a giant Crescent wrench to the

Ruthlessly runs him head first into a standing tool
chest Delfy collapses to the ground in a heap
Unconscious

duffle bag in the back Carrie nods to Pryce Motions
for him to go one way shell go another

Carrie gets to the Cat Springs toward the door
Insides empty

Pryce walks under THE WING of the next plane Spots
Delfy just ahead on the ground by the tool chest Looks
like hes stirring into consciousness Then --

SWOOSH An ICE AXE swings down from above embedding in
his Pryces chest Deep It sticks Gun goes flying
eller drops down from the wing above Pryce staggers
eller kicks him hard

Pryce goes down Keller grabs the gun

Points it right at Pryce -- before he can shoot --

BANG BANG Bullets zip by Keller who rolls for cover
behind SOME EQUIPMENT Another rips into his shoulder

eller spots Carrie over by the Cat She fires
continually forcing him to stay behind cover The shots

go wide -- shes not yet used to firing with the right
hand
eller blindly reaches his gun around the chest -- shoots

back which --

-- Gives Pryce enough time to painfully crawl for cover
beneath the plane Hes losing blood quick

Carrie keeps shooting Bullets PING OFF THE TOOL CHEST
They stop Carrie has to reload

Keller makes his move Fires at Carrie and sprints for
his plane Runs right by pole with a large red button
attached to it Slams it

HANGAR DOORS BEGIN TO RUMBLE OPEN

The TEMPERATURE immediately begins to PLUMMET as winter
is let inside
Keller keeps shooting Runs out of bullets Leaps into
the idling Otter

Carrie makes her move Dashes toward him firing away

Bullets PLANT in the WINDSHIELD but cant penetrate --
glass is too thick -- protection from the cold

Keller throttles Begins to move the Otter forward
toward the opening doors

Carrie dashes to Pryce Sees Delfy get to his feet
Face bloody He moves to Pryce

She gets over to the guys quickly giving Delfy a visual
once over Hell be fine but things look bad for Pryce
Hes bleeding profusely

She kneels beside him -- pulls the tip of the axe out of
his chest

Delfy looks to the hangar doors which are nearly open

PRYCE
I didnt see him

His eyes flutter shut Carrie slaps his face --
CARRIE
No You stay awake
Puts her hand directly on the wound Applies pressure

Blood continues to ooze

She looks over to Keller just as his plane exits the
hangar

Looks back to Pryces wound -- wont stop bleeding

After all this no way Keller
didnt have it on the plane
because hes got it hidden

Where would he hide something for

A SQUEAKY NOISE in the back of the room draws their

along the side Carries plunged into inky black

She HEARS the Science Lab door open before her -- peers
through the dark blanket to see Doc walking toward her

tight against the wall Doc walks right by and out the

Storage racks of frozen science samples line the three
walls Lying on the floor are the bodies of Mooney
Rubin Weiss and Keller

Carry goes to Weiss body Kneels next to him Goes to
unzip the bodybag but sees that its been locked with a
plastic cinch

Pulls out her knife Holds the light steady in her mouth
as she cuts the cinch Unzips the bag

Her light travels down his body to his left leg She
rolls it slightly for a better look The truth hits her
like a sledge hammer There it is like standing center
stage in her light the ROW OF STITCHES holding a deep
gash tight together

Shes about to stand and walk out but she stops herself
Thinks about that leg those stitches The fact that Doc
lied to her Pans her light over at the other bodies on
the floor Her light pans back explores the rest of
Weiss upper body -- sees a dried river of blood thats
run out from under his armpit

(to herself)
Someplace no one would ever think
to look

She raises Weiss arm More stitches

She cuts through them Skin splits to reveal the BOTTOM
OF A CANNISTER thats been stuffed inside his chest She
reaches in and pulls it out Even has rust on the
bottom Carries confused -- ITS NOT LIKE ANY OF THE
CANNISTERS PRYCE SHOWED HER PHOTOS OF It look more like
THE ICE CORE CONTAINER SHE SAW AT MCMURDO

She contemplates opening it for a moment then places her
hand on the top Begins to twist It loosens easily
Pulls the lid off Looks at it Whatever it is its
frozen Tilts the can slightly and out slides a FOOT
LONG ICE CORE SAMPLE Cant quite figure it out until
she shines her light on it --

sample is PACKED FULL OF DIAMONDS She looks to the

If they had just gone along with

Those fools found a plane -- had
no idea what they stumbled onto
Turns out the Russians had
discovered a diamond field while
drilling for core samples in the
sixties

CARRIE
And we thought it was nukes the
whole time

Doc
Keller said he knew someone in the
states who could move the diamonds
for us It was a hell of a lot of
money

CARRIE
How did you get wrapped up in
thing Doc

Doc
Weiss got hurt on the plane They
were afraid to move him so Mooney
called me Keller and I flew out
But they couldnt get the safe

open -- Keller found a way
CARRIE

Then Weiss got cold feet It got

ugly didnt it -- and Keller

killed him at Delta One One
Everything went to hell after
that didnt it Doc

Keller thought he could kill his

way out of this whole thing

Where you going to stuff my body
too Huh Was I going to be

He turns back to the ice axe and starts walking towards
it

She pulls the gun out from inside her liner her mind a
whirl of limited options and grim solutions

He nears the ice axe on the cart --
Carrie cocks back the trigger --
CARRIE (contd)
I wont go through it again

Dont make me shoot you please

Her knuckle on her trigger finger goes white as she
wrestles with her emotions

Doc
Its either ignore all of this or
kill me -- and you and I were

too good of friends for me to
force you to make that choice

With thathe walks right past the ICE AXE and into the

CARRIE
Doc your not thinking straight
But hes not listening

DOC
Ya know its really warm Im
gonna take a walk -- try and cool

He musters a smile --

Using both hands on the latch he pulls THE DOOR BLASTS

Docs throws one last look to Carrie then takes two
steps out the door

Disappears into the blanket of white

Wind and cold storm into the room against Carrie who
remains standing still like a statue Emotionally

drained Numb Freezing to death -- tears frozen to her
cheeks
A shadow passes by her -- its Pryce Hes hunkered over

in pain but forcing himself against the driving force of
the wind into the Ready Room

Latches onto the door It takes everything hes got but
he manages to get it closed Instant silence

Cold to the bone he grabs a jacket off the racket
Approaches Carrie who remains staring at the closed
door The effects of the chill and Docs decision
