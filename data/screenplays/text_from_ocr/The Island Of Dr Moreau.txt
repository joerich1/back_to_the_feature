FADE IN
EXT SOMEWHERE IN NEW ENGLAND - DUSK

A curtain of rain falls across the treetops descending upon the
soft green hills and the patchwork farmsteads

A dog comes running along the crest of a hill rejoicing barking
at the rain

The dog skids to a halt shaking itself turning its snout outward
toward the fading light

CUT TO
INT THE COTTAGE - DUSK

A log spits on the hearth sending firelight across the untidy room
and the gaunt figure of EDWARD PRENDICK who sits hunched in the
semi-darkness half listening to a COMPACT DISC RECORDING of a
bluesy romantic ballad

Prendick glances down at the tabletop at the piles of notepaper
and the dense crabbed handwriting that covers them at the
repeated sketches and doodles representing what we will come to
recognize as the emblem of the Tree of Life at the

empty coffee cups the overflowing ashtray and the dismembered
pieces of the 38 pistol that lie before him

He touches a button on a REMOTE CONTROL and the singing stops He
next touches the button on a TAPE RECORDER which whirrs to
life

As Prendick speaks as he reaches down and begins to assemble the
gun his eyes unreadable his lids red and bruised from lack of
sleep a weeks growth of stubble on his waxy cheeks His movements
are slow and deliberate

PRENDICK
In a spirit of complete honesty I want to say
right from the start that I think weve made
some really incredible mistakes about God We
tell ourselves that Hes all-powerful when we
really should be questioning His competence
Believe me Im not asking for miracles A
little adult leadership would do

Prendick brushes aside the papers on his desk and gropes around
impatiently for a box of cartridges
PRENDICK
As for Gods love all I know for certain is
that He loves our suffering And as for His
power well maybe He can do whatever He wants
with us but theres one thing Im pretty
certain He cant do When hes sick of existing
He cant end it Only we can do that

Prendick opens the box and begins to load the revolver six
cartridges Then he stops laughs shakes his head and empties out
all but one cartridge

PRENDICK
My names Edward Prendick Until about ten years
ago I was a lawyer specializing in what was
mis-named Human Rights In August of 2007 I was
travelling as Special Envoy for the United
Nations as a part of the effort to stop the
bloody civil war in Micronesia Thats where it
began This is where it will end

Prendick raises the revolver and almost touches it to his lips
savoring the moment of his obliteration

THUNDER CRASHES on the soundtrack

CUT TO
EXT THE SOUTH PACIFIC - DAY

We are flying

Soaring above tropical rainclouds mist stretching away beneath us
illuminated from within by pulsing veins of lightning

The canopy of cloud parts giving way to a limitless vista of
open sea a horizon so vast that one can almost see the curve of
the earth

PRENDICK (VO)
Our plane went down in a magnetic storm just
above the equator at roughly 165 longitude

We see a yellow dot in the distance now a tiny life raft adrift in
a world of water

There are THREE MEN aboard two of them wearing the uniform of the
United Nations peacekeeping force and the third Prendick dressed
in the remains of a bedraggled threepiece suit a life jacket
around his neck
The two soldiers one Nordic the other vaguely Hispanic are
locked in a violent struggle while Prendick tries ineffectually to
separate them

PRENDICK (VO)
Wed been adrift four days when the fever hit
us

SOLDIER 1(Hispanic)
Stay away from me

PRENDICK
Leave him

SOLDIER 2
He cant last His water can save us

PRENDICK
Leave him We can make it through this
Theyll find us

Soldier 2 doesnt reply instead he makes a lunge for his comrades
throat Prendick tries to grab the soldiers legs but the dinghy
rolls heavily and he loses his grip The soldier administers a
savage kick to his head and he goes down one hand raised to
protect his face the other reaching for the flare gun The second
soldier has his hands around the first soldiers throat and the two
of them grapple desperately locked in a death grip

Prendick raises the flare gun levelling it at soldier 2s head
his hand shaking

PRENDICK
Let him go you son of a bitch

The man releases his companion who crumples to the floor of the
raft retching and gasping for breath

He turns slowly to face Prendick staring with sun-glazed eyes down
the wavering barrel of the flare gun

SOLDIER 2
Youre some fucking lawyer Dont ‘you know the
first law of nature is survival

PRENDICK
Were not animals

The soldier eyes Prendick up and down afraid to call his bluff
Then with a yell the soldier 1 springs at him a survival knife
glinting in his hand
PRENDICK
No

SOLDIER 1
Cabron

Both men are screaming now soldier 2 is driven back as his former
comrade drives his blade into him blood going everywhere

The soldier pulls away staring in disbelief at his wound He tries
to get to his feet but the first soldier plunges the knife into him
again He doubles up emitting a grunt his hands grasping now at
his assailant

The dinghy pitches heavily to one side and the wounded soldier goes
overboard dragging his comrade with him

He sinks like a stone but his murderer struggles for a moment
breaking free of his grip and trying to stay afloat as Prendick
reaches out to him

Then there is a white flash in the water and he is dragged under
with barely a yell the life raft shivering as the creatures of the
deep brush against its underside jostling each other as they feed

Prendick collapses to the floor of the dinghy with a groan
He lies staring at the sky for a moment alone now with the open
sea Slowly he begins to laugh his laughter growing gradually

louder and more uncontrollable

He raises the gun and squeezing the trigger sends a white magnesium
flare arcing up into the vault of the sky

DISSOLVE TO
THE DISC OF THE SUN

A dazzling overexposed white
The SOUND of the hissing flare

DISSOLVE THROUGH WHITE TO
EXT THE SAME OCEAN - DAY (TWO DAYS LATER)
Prendick lies in the bottom of the dinghy watching the swaying
horizon his eyes unfocused his face raw and blistered from the
relentless sun
His head sways with the rise and fall of the ocean and all the

horizon seems to sway with him the earth and the sky and the
shining crack that separates them
A dark smudge appears on the far horizon Dancing Drawing nearer
He closes his eyes

When he opens them again he sees the side of the freighter looming
over him a row of figures gathered at the rail outlines shadowy
against the sun

A MAN with a droopy Zapata moustache and sad eyes his long flaxen
hair tied back in a tail an OLDER MAN his angry freckled face
framed by red hair and lastly standing beside them as if ina
fever dream is the third man a DARK MAN whose eyes shine
feverishly

Hands lift Prendick Dark powerful hands
His head lolls back and he knows no more

CUT TO
INT CABIN - DAY

We see a CLOSEUP of the MAN with the moustache (MONTGOMERY )
looking solicitously down at Prendick

Prendick groans

MONTGOMERY
Easy now ole buddy

Prendick opens his eyes to find himself in a small untidy cabin
crammed with specimen jars containing gaudy tropical orchids

A low animal SNARL comes from somewhere outside the cabin and
Prendick glances around himself uneasily

MONTGOMERY
Feel better

PRENDICK
Where am I

MONTGOMERY
Youre okay Dont worry
Prendick looks nervously down at himself as if to make sure he
all still there Montgomery smiles reassuringly

s

PRENDICK
Who are you
Prendick

Prendick

MONTGOMERY

PRENDICK
What ship is this

MONTGOMERY

(smiles)
We all dropped Ipecacuanha and bayed at the
moon

PRENDICK
My names Edward Prendick I have to get to

back Prendick is now aware hes on an IV

MONTGOMERY

PRENDICK
Moresbys our first stop

MONTGOMERY
Second They have to land me first

PRENDICK

MONTGOMERY
An island where I live But theres limited
communications no one you could call from
there

PRENDICK

A remote island
(dares a smile)
Everymans dream

MONTGOMERY
Right now its your turn to dream Im gonna
give you a shot
Montgomery holds up a hypodermic needle tenderly pats Prendicks
arm and administers a shot

PRENDICK
What is it

MONTGOMERY
Trust me blindly Youll like it

PRENDICK
Are you a doctor

MONTGOMERY
Lets say Im a para-medic

There is another burst of feral SNARLING from outside and this time
there is a mans voice as well

DAVIS
GOD DAMN IT SHUT THEM UP

Prendick glances up at the cabin ceiling and the direction of the
muffled yells

MONTGOMERY
Thats a great shot I just gave you Edward
Ive known people whod sell their grandmothers
for a shot like that so dont piss it away Try
and get some sleep

Prendick relaxes and the cabin goes blurry around the edges once
more as the sleeping potion begins to take effect

MONTGOMERY
There you go Eddie Dream

Prendicks eyes wander down onto the lettering stencilled on

one of the packing cases DESTINATION US BIOSTATION BRAVO RIO
DELTA VIA SUVA And from somewhere on deck the cries start up
again as Prendick drifts slowly down into oblivion

CUT TO
INT THE SAME CABIN - DAY (A DAY LATER)

Consciousness washes slowly back into Prendicks mind as he finds
himself watching a puddle of sunlight stretch slowly across the
cabin ceiling

Prendick sits up to see that the cabin door is standing ajar and a
fresh set of clothes are laid out for him at the foot of the bed
He gets slowly to his feet rubbing his head catching a brief
glimpse of his sun-scarred face in the cabin mirror

CUT TO
EXT THE DECK - DAY

Prendick glances about the freighter deck blinking in the
sunshine not prepared by the SOUNDS for what he sees

The whole deck is littered with scraps of carrots shreds of green
stuff and indescribable filth

All along the starboard bulwark are big hutches filled with rabbits
and there is a solitary llama squeezed into a cage forward A
number of grisly staghounds are fastened to the rail by muzzles and
chains and in the center of the deck a huge black leopard sits
cramped in a small iron cage A short FIGURE (MLING) sits beside
the cage

There is something particularly arresting about MLings face the
slightest elongation of his features and an almost feral intensity
that informs his expression

He gets to his feet and starts suddenly towards Prendick a curious
glow of excitement in his face

Prendick takes a step backwards and almost bumps into Montgomery
who has appeared from the hatchway behind him and who now pushes
past to come between Prendick and MLing

MLing steps back as if afraid

MONTGOMERY
God damn it MLing what the hells the matter
with you I told you to stay forward

MLING
They wont have me forward They say I
disturb the animals

MONTGOMERY
Come on man dont give me that bullshit I
told you to fucking STAY FORWARD You want me to
tell Dr Moreau about this

MLing turns slowly and moves away Montgomery turns glancing

nervously back at Prendick

PRENDICK
What are these animals
They are interrupted by a loud YELP and a VOLLEY OF CURSES from the
companionway MLing runs pathetically back onto the deck pursued
by a heavy red-haired MAN in a white cap MLing hesitates when he
sees Montgomery and the red haired man

catches up to him striking him between the shoulder blades and
sending him sprawling into the midst of the furiously barking
staghounds

The red-haired man staggers onto the deck and Montgomery steps
towards him angrily

MONTGOMERY
Hey Captain lighten up That man is a paid
passenger So tell your crew to keep their
filthy hands off of him

DAVIS
Or what I do what I like on my own ship

Davis turns away and staggers across to the rail Montgomery
following him

MONTGOMERY
Youve been hassling my man there since we got
on board
(Under his breath
to Prendick)
Most obvious case of drug psychosis Ive ever
seen

DAVIS
Drug what Whatre you talking about there

MONTGOMERY
Maritime Law This man happens to be a lawyer

DAVIS
Heres the maritime law on my ship
(He pulls out a pistol)
I dont like freaks aboard you hippy burn-out

Montgomery turns away as Davis shouts after him
DAVIS
He comes to this end of the ship again and Ill
cut his guts out The animals go crazy when they

smell him

Prendick feels impelled to step in
PRENDICK
Just a minute Im a Special Envoy for the
United Nations

DAVIS
Youre tits on a bull so you stay out of this
United Nations Freeloading bastard taking up

space on my ship Side with him and youll sink
with him Hear me

Speechless Prendick watches Davis stumble back down the
companionway

When he glances around he sees that both Montgomery and MLing
are watching him silently

CUT TO
EXT THE FREIGHTERS RAIL — NIGHT

Prendick stands beside Montgomery on the quarterdeck staring up at
the awesome canopy of stars overhead

Montgomery passes him a smoldering joint

MONTGOMERY
Try some of this

Prendick waves it away

MONTGOMERY
I guarantee it I grew it myself

Prendick takes it out of good manners but declines to smoke
it He casts an eye over Montgomerys crumpled outfit the
unbuttoned Hawaiian shirt bare feet gold cross around his neck
and a portion of a Princeton Flag tattooed on his chest

PRENDICK
I havent seen many Princeton tattoos

MONTGOMERY
Yeah its not the ivy league thing Maybe
thats why I did it
Montgomery looks at him at the joint hes still holding

MONTGOMERY
You’re supposed to smoke that thing

PRENDICK
(handing back the joint)
I remember a post game party at Harvard I was
taken suddenly drunk and I begged a Radcliff
senior to carve her initials on my chest

MONTGOMERY
(brightly)
Silver spooner right

PRENDICK
Well I wasnt on a scholarship

MONTGOMERY
I can always tell When we fished you out of the
water I could smell the money on you Old

money The best kind The nose knows What did
you study
PRENDICK

I got a degree in Humanities

MONTGOMERY
Humanities Isnt that a licence to jerk off

PRENDICK
(Laughing)
No I had law school for that Were you pre-med

MONTGOMERY
Biology But that was a long time ago

He returns his attention to the sea

PRENDICK
Listen you know you saved my life

MONTGOMERY
(recoiling)
I wouldnt get choked up about it

PRENDICK
Yeah well thanks In any case I owe you my
thanks

MONTGOMERY

You dont owe me anything You lucked out I
happened to be bored that day looking for a
little action If Id been feeling differently
youd still be out there Id have stood here
and waved you bye-bye

PRENDICK
Thats Bullshit

MONTGOMERY
Believe whatever youve got to believe I know you
liberals need your little fairy tales

The two men look awkwardly away from each other

PRENDICK
How did you happen to come out here

MONTGOMERY
You know Eddie I see us more like ships that
pass in the night not assholes who meet on a
plane and tell each other the story of their
lives

PRENDICK

(shrugs )

Whatever

They lapse into awkward silence

MONTGOMERY
Ever get yourself in real trouble

Montgomery gives him a look of anticipation

PRENDICK
I helped draft the constitution for a small
African nation There was a coup My staff and
I were held hostage by a warlord They shot one
of us each day Six people

MONTGOMERY

But not you Youre a survivor

PRENDICK
So far But its not over

MONTGOMERY
Sure it is Youll be back in the States eating
at Rodney Rockets and Ill be

PRENDICK
On your island Paradise

MONTGOMERY
(smiles)
Paradise Thats Moreaus dream alright

PRENDICK
Moreau

MONTGOMERY
Man I work for He once did for me what I did for you

PRENDICK
Pulled you out of a lifeboat

MONTGOMERY
Pulled me out and asked no questions Anyway
its a boring little story and its not like you
and me are friends

PRENDICK
We could be

MONTGOMERY
Wouldnt work

PRENDICK
Whys that

MONTGOMERY
Cause its plain as the nose on your face that
you think Im crazy

Montgomery throws the joint into the sea and Prendick turns away
his eyes lighting now on the dark shape of M’Ling who is leaning
over the taffrail MLing turns towards him for an instant his

eyes glowing a pale luminous green in the light of the wheelhouse

DISSOLVE TO
EXT THE SOUTH PACIFIC - DAWN

There is a CLATTER of chains and a tortured hydraulic WHINING
followed by a scarcely human clamor of SHOUTS AND GRUNTS as a cage
holding a frightened black leopard is hoisted skyward by a crude
rig of chain and cable spinning in the air above the rising sun

CUT TO
INT THE CABIN - DAWN

Prendick wakes from an uneasy slumber and sits up in his bunk
rubbing his head hearing HOARSE SHOUTING and PATTERING FEET
overhead As he gets to his feet there is a violent CREAKING SOUND
and the freighter lists uneasily

CUT TO
EXT THE DECK - DAWN

As Prendick comes up the ladder the first thing he sees is the
flushed sky and the rising sun over the broad back and red hair of
the Captain who stands arms upraised while above him the black
leopard spins in its cage

DAVIS
I dont give a shit Off load all of them Now
well have a clean ship

Prendick pushes past him and Davis turns with a start staring
drunkenly at him

DAVIS

Hullo why its Mister Mister
PRENDICK

Prendick
DAVIS

Mr Prawn-dick You too Youre off my ship

PRENDICK
(shocked)
What do you mean Off where

DAVIS
Where do you think Back into the sea thats
where Plenty of room for you there

PRENDICK
Wait a minute you cant

DAVIS
(rolling his eyes)
Oh Mother here we go again Mr Prawn-dicks
telling me what I can and cant do on my own
ship My own ship

Prendick looks past Davis and sees the island for the first time
the jagged crest of a submerged mountain rising sheer from the
ocean its flanks covered with palm trees and dense scrub a thin
streamer of smoke rising from the treetops

A large motor launch lies under the lee of the freighter and it is
into this that the SAILORS are busy loading the last of the caged
animals

MLing is already aboard the launch helping three brutish-looking
BOATMEN with the staghounds while Montgomery stands on the gangway
talking with a NEWCOMER dressed in slightly grey white flannels and
a battered Panama hat The mans blazing eyes stern expression and
long grey hair and beard remind Prendick of a prophet out of the
Old Testament

DAVIS
Right this way Mister

PRENDICK
Fuck you Im not getting off here Get away
from me

He looks to Montgomery

MONTGOMERY
(to the captain)
Take him to Moresby hell pay you

DAVIS
He can swim

MONTGOMERY
Look Ill pay you

DAVIS
I dont want your money I piss on your money

Montgomery looks at Moreau who says nothing He shouts back to
Davis

MONTGOMERY
Youll have to take him He cant come here

PRENDICK
(desperate)
Montgomery For Christs sake

Montgomery already boarding the launch nods towards Moreau as if
to indicate that he is powerless to intervene

MONTGOMERY
Eddie Im really sorry

Prendick glances around to see that he is loosely ringed now by
belligerent-looking sailors Two of the sailors take him by the
arms and he begins to struggle

PRENDICK
God damn it get your hands off me
He pulls free from the sailors and hits one of them hard enough to
land him on the deck Before he can go for the other one several
more are on him The decked sailor rises and hits him in the
stomach

DAVIS
Adios Mr Prawn-dick Give my regards to the
UN Great work you people are doing I

really hold you in awe

Davis laughs maniacally as Prendick doubled over is hauled still
struggling to the gangway but the launch is fully laden now and
shoves off hastily A broadening gap of green water appears beneath
Prendick who pushes back with all his strength now trying to grab
hold of the ships rail

Stronger hands pry loose his fingers and he plunges from the ship

Bubbles explode around him and he goes under for a moment before
kicking his way back to the surface gasping at the sudden shock of
the water

Above him he sees the steep side of the freighter already starting
to come about its engines throbbing Davis standing at the rail
still shouting unintelligible abuse at him

He turns and strikes out for the island trying to distance himself
from the ships propellers

Then with relief he sees that the launch has turned back towards
him As the launch draws nearer he is able to make out the figure
of Moreau sitting cramped up with the dogs in the bow staring
fixedly but not without kindness at him MLings face watching him
intently from the stern

The launch comes alongside him and the three brutish boatmen haul
him awkwardly aboard where he crouches shivering glancing around
uneasily at his rescuers

There is something strange about the features of the boatmen They
seem to be of some queer brown-skinned race their elfin faces
peering out at him from beneath dirty turbans lank black hair
almost like horse hair framing their bright eyes

As he meets their gaze first one and then the other turn away from
him in a deferential manner

Moreau smiles at him

MOREAU
(over the engines)
I couldnt let you drown could I I had no idea
hed really throw you in

Moreau turns away and looks to the crates Looking up Prendick
catches Montgomerys eyes as the launch comes about once more and
starts back towards the island He is serious even grim

MONTGOMERY
This wasnt my idea Remember that

There is a soberness to Montgomerys voice that only deepens
Prendicks unease as he turns his attention towards the approaching
beach

Prendick turns towards Moreau as if to speak but the Doctor fixes
him with a look part smile part warning and Prendick says
nothing

CUT TO
EXT THE ISLAND - DAY

Several LOCALS have assembled on the narrow jetty to meet the
launch some of them hopping up and down in undisguised excitement

One of the boathands throws a rope ashore and the launch cuts its
engines and makes fast

Prendick steps ashore looking dazedly about himself as the boatmen
begin to unload jabbering excitedly in their curious guttural
voices Montgomery and Moreau shouting the occasional command above
the clamor of the staghounds

The island has the immediate lush beauty of all tropical Pacific
islands Birds call melodically from the surrounding lush
vegetation giving one the impression that life teems just beyond
view

Prendick hears the SOUND of a grumbling engine and looks up to see
a battered military flatbed come bouncing down the narrow track
that connects the jetty with a fenced compound on the ridge
overlooking the beach

At the center of the compound is an old colonial-style building and
a cluster of Nissan huts painted in a manner reminiscent of either
camouflage or Aboriginal art Beyond the roofs of the Nissan huts
Prendick can see the top of a radio mast and two rusting satellite
dishes

The main house is surrounded by a wide lawn enclosed by an electric
fence At the bottom of the lawn is a wooden rostrum overlooking
the compound gate and a flagpole from the top of which flies the
emblem of the Tree of Life

MLing passes him now bearing a packing case and talking
enthusiastically with one of his fellow BEARERS a man with oddly
doglike features who wears a white jacket

He looks again to the beach and sees Moreau approaching him his
expression benign but formal

MOREAU
I regret we really have no facilities for
guests but we can feed you You look like you
could use some breakfast

PRENDICK
I wont be here for long Im overdue as it is

MOREAU
Yes Montgomery told me you work for the UN a
lawyer Fascinating I know very little of law
myself

PRENDICK
Once I call Im sure theyll send a boat or a
plane

MOREAU

Yes unfortunately at the moment our COMSAT
equipment is down but were working on it

He looks absently out to sea

MOREAU
Since the ozone layer started going weve had
communication problems Something about magnetic
storms Im a biologist I dont really
understand electronics

MLing returns now having loaded his burden onto the parked
flatbed He kneels beside Moreau

MLING
Father I am so glad to see you again

Moreau pats MLings arm and then incredibly the manservant takes

the doctors hand and kisses it

MOREAU
Yes MLing Im glad to see you too
MLING

Father I have seen the strangest things out
there So confusing
MOREAU

Yes MLing You must tell me all about it
The doctor glances back at Prendick who is watching

To make the scene complete in the background a few of these
strange men are holding a softball practise one of them bats
the ball to the others who race around clumsily trying to catch
it

Moreaus eyes wander across the curious islanders fixing now on
the man in the white coat

MOREAU
Id better get busy Azazello see what Mr
Prendick would like for breakfast
(Glancing back at Prendick)

Oh and I have to ask that you restrict yourself
to the main house Its because of our insurance
coverage The people who fund us are afraid you
might twist your ankle and sue us

PRENDICK
(smiles)
Unfortunately its a litigious world

MOREAU
Yes Im sure you know all about that

We hear the crack of a bat and happy shouting

PRENDICK
Are these people native to this island
(off Moreaus look)
Theyre very unusual looking

MOREAU
Yes many areas of the Pacific have very limited
gene pools

Moreau moves off as Azazello approaches Prendick awaiting his

order

AZAZELLO
Sair you want breakfast
Azazello

PRENDICK
Uhm two eggs some bacon

AZAZELLO
(snickering nastily)

No bacon here No eggs

PRENDICK
Then whatever there is Some fruit

AZAZELLO
Fruit and granola

PRENDICK
Fine

grins with inappropriate good humor

AZAZELLO
Yaba daba doo

Azazello turns away and follows Moreau toward the big house passing
the rest of the group who are loading the flatbed now with the
caged animals from the boat

Montgomery who has been supervising the islanders breaks away

from his

work and comes over to Prendick

MONTGOMERY
So You okay

PRENDICK
Yeah and thanks once again you saved

MONTGOMERY
Well that depends on how you look at
watch myself if I were you Strictly
know what I mean

PRENDICK
(shrugs)
He seems nice enough

MONTGOMERY
(suddenly serious)
Hes one of the greatest men alive

He pauses for a moment then changes tack

MONTGOMERY
Give me a hand with these will you

my life

it Id
eyes down
He crouches beside one of the crates stacked near the end of the
jetty and lifts it Indicating another Prendick lifts it and
follows Montgomery a short distance from the jetty where he sets
his burden down in a clump of brush on the beach near some hastily
constructed hutches and the rusting remains of pickup truck
Montgomery opens one of the crates and starts removing white
rabbits and putting them into the hutch

MONTGOMERY
Theyre for the black leopard Damned cat will
eat better than I do
(off Prendick)
Didnt you see the old mans earth shoes Ima
protein freak stuck with a fanatical vegetarian

PRENDICK
None of the other animals are eaten

MONTGOMERY
Seal your lips at the thought

Montgomery opens another of the crates Several animals bolt out
the open door and escape He and Prendick grab for them but they
make it to the surrounding jungle

MONTGOMERY
Alright little ones Go ye forth and
multiply Born to fuck and theyre so-o-o

cute

Montgomery returns his attention to the crate Reaching in he
removes the last rabbit a large buck The animal kicks and
struggles in an attempt to join the others who have fled
Montgomery kneels letting the rabbits feet touch the ground He
strokes the animal and calms it

MONTGOMERY
Lusting for those runaway bunnies big guy

With a conspiratorial smile he looks at Prendick

MONTGOMERY
Think this fellowd be missed

Thinking Montgomery plans to release the rabbit Prendick smiles
shrugs

PRENDICK
Whos to know
MONTGOMERY
Right whos to know

With a quick twist Montgomery breaks the rabbits neck The
animal screams and dies Prendick reacts

MONTGOMERY
(off Prendicks look)
What you dont like barbecued bunny

CUT TO
EXT THE COMPOUND - DAY

The flatbed inches its way back up the hill laden down with a
deadweight of cages and packing cases

Prendick stands on the back of the truck as they pass an area where
jungle borders the sides of the road Among the trees he sees
several spectacularly beautiful tropical birds which seem totally
unafraid only curious at his passing As they drive beneath a low
bough a large Banks Cockatoo dips his head in a friendly gesture
causing Prendick to extend his hand returning a gesture of
friendship

Clearing the jungle they reach the clearing and pass a main gate
and a pipe corral where a grey-white thoroughbred crops at grass

Further on Prendick is able to get a closer view of magnifiscent
bright green aloes that surround the big house As they pass close
by one of the plants he can hear a low TRILLING SOUND emanating
from its fleshy tendrilled branches that seem to quiver in the
breeze even when Prendick can feel no breeze

The flatbed winds around the side of the big house and pulls up in
a shady courtyard

Montgomery ushers Prendick into the house

CUT TO
INT THE HOUSE — DAY

Prendick finds himself in a large hall-turned-dining area its
walls lined with bookshelves and specimen cases

Montgomery hesitates for a moment in the doorway

MONTGOMERY
Stay here And I mean stay right here I wont
be long

(calls out)
Moreau

He leaves Prendick who wanders the library As his gaze wanders
over a series of old photos Moreau in his thirties with an
attractive woman both holding the reins of their horses while the
wind whips their hair in some wilderness setting In another
Moreau embraces a conductor and first violinist beside a piano on a
concert stage While Montgomery can be heard calling Moreau off
screen Prendick examines a row of framed academic certificates
hanging beside a row of crucified butterflies and Da Vinci
anatomical sketches One yellowing certificate is from the Nobel
Committee beneath it set against blue velvet is a medallion the
prize

Somewhere in the background a song is heard from a CD player the
same love ballad heard in the opening scene

Prendick turns slowly drawn towards the source of the music

On the far side of the room an open doorway leads through a small
densely planted arboretum to a sun drenched veranda facing the sea
Through it beyond the foreground foliage Prendick glimpses a
figure moving gently to the music A beautiful young woman
barefoot and clad in a sarong turning slowly in a puddle of
sunlight Her eyes are closed her only audience a bright green
parrot watching from its perch at the far end of the veranda
Transfixed Prendick moves towards her

He stops amidst the foliage of the arboretum taken by a sudden
reverie

Something moves in the dense verdure near his head Prendick turns
to see a pair of disturbingly human eyes set in a wizened face
belonging to a small arboreal creature about the size of a large
galago or lorus that peers from the foliage

Prendicks curiosity elicits an sudden aggressive response Teeth
bared the creature threatens with a rasping growl and a terrier-
like snap causing Prendick to take a quick step back As he
regains his composure he hears a young womans laugh

Prendick turns

The dancer a beautiful YOUNG WOMAN barefoot and clad in a sarong
faces him from a few feet away At his glance her smile quickly
fades to something akin to fear

Prendick sees now that she has the same unusual tan as the
islanders while her high vaguely oriental cheekbones and light
green eyes give her a somewhat feline cast further enhanced by the
slightest deformation of her upper lip as if she has had a harelip
surgically corrected in childhood

PRENDICK
Is it some kind of pet

He takes a step towards her Like a child who has spoken out of
turn she demurs and backs away

Prendick raises his hands to show he means no harm

PRENDICK
Wait its all right

AISSA
Who are you

PRENDICK
I just got here

She looks questioningly at him still apprehensive

PRENDICK
This morning I came on the boat

AISSA
Did the doctor bring you

PRENDICK
Yes

AISSA
Have you come from the sea

PRENDICK
I come from New York

AISSA
(brightly)
Oh yes New York That is another island

PRENDICK
Thats right it is

She looks intently at Prendickshands then holds up her own
hands counting her fingers

AISSA
One two three four five Youre a
Five Man

Prendick looks at her in bewilderment

PRENDICK
My names Edward Prendick

AISSA
Pren-Dick

PRENDICK
Pren-dick

She kneels suddenly before him and taking his hand presses it to
her lips in a curious form of greeting

AISSA
You have small hands It is good

He looks with real interest at Aissa and at that moment there
comes something like a low GROWL from behind him He turns to see
Azazello and MLing (who has changed into white coat) emerge from
the study with his breakfast and a steaming pot of coffee on two
serving trays

Aissa draws away from them

AZAZELLO
Your breakfast Sair

PRENDICK
Put it uh out here

AZAZELLO
Yes Sair

Azazello and MLing lay his breakfast on a nearby table while Aissa
keeps a cautious distance There is an unmistakable tension between

her and Azazello

Prendick sits down and pours himself a coffee motioning for Aissa
to join him once MLing and Azazello have withdrawn to the study

PRENDICK
Please sit down Will you have some coffee

She shakes her head and seats herself opposite him peering in
undisguised fascination at his face and hands

AISSA
Your hands are so beautiful
Prendick is charmed by this amused and quite turned on

PRENDICK
Thanks No ones ever noticed them before

Azazello peers in at them once furtively from the study door

Aissa doesnt see him but bristles slightly knowing hes there

PRENDICK
Are you from this island

AISSA
My father brought me here when I was very young

PRENDICK
Where are you from originally

AISSA
Father says I was born in Suva

PRENDICK
Will you tell me your name

She looks away shyly raising her hands to her mouth

Then MLing calls her from the study inadvertently answering
Prendicks question

MLING (0S)
Aissa

Aissa shoots Prendick a swift somewhat coquettish glance

AISSA
They need me now I have to rehearse

PRENDICK
Rehearse what

AISSA
Alice in Wonderland Im Alice

She slips away her movements swift yet strangely graceful her

bare feet making scarcely a sound as she pads across the verandah

Prendick looks after her fascinated

Exiting through the study door she almost collides with Montgomery

who glances amusedly from her to Prendick a smoldering joint
poised between his thumb and forefinger
MONTGOMERY
Well I see were getting acquainted
(He sighs)
Lovely thing little Aissa

Montgomery offers the joint to Prendick who declines it

PRENDICK
I saw the awards a Nobel Prize

MONTGOMERY
Moreaus a famous name in genetics Or infamous
depending on who you listen to

PRENDICK
Why infamous

MONTGOMERY
Hes a genius so everybody whos not a genius
hates his guts Most scientific research is
totally motivated by jealousy and greed And
vanity dont want to forget vanity He came
out here to escape that

PRENDICK
How long has he been on this island

MONTGOMERY
Eighteen years The animal rights boobies drove
him to it Got so in the States you couldnt
cage a rat without reading him his rights

PRENDICK
And you

MONTGOMERY
Almost ten years for me

He offers the joint to Prendick

PRENDICK
No thanks

PRENDICK
(cautious )
Listen Montgomery

MONTGOMERY
(not liking the tone)
What
PRENDICK
Your assistant MLing Theres something kind
of His ears are strange theyre sort of
pointed

MONTGOMERY
What Pointed ears Youre shitting me

PRENDICK
So what is he a Vulcan

MONTGOMERY
No and I think its incredibly insensitive of
you to bring it up How would you like it if
someone made remarks about your ears

PRENDICK
And the guy who brought my breakfast acts very
weird What is it they dont like their wages

MONTGOMERY
What are you suddenly Amnesty International
Trust me No one complains

Montgomery offers the joint Prendick waves it off

MONTGOMERY
No Youre missing out Back when we dabbled in
plant genes I created this Like everything else
on this Island some serious method went into
this shit

Montgomerys expression hardens noticeably and he stands now

motioning for Prendick to follow him

MONTGOMERY
Come on man I think its time I showed you
your room

PRENDICK

God damn it Montgomery Talk to me
MONTGOMERY

Sssh Dig it

Prendick joins Montgomery in the study door to see MLing
sitting at one end of the room reading determinedly from
Carrol

AISSA

and Aissa
Lewis
And thou hast slain the Jabberwock Come to my
arms my beamish boy O Frabjous day Callooh
Callay He chortled in his joy

Prendick looks across at Aissa and their gaze meets for an instant
before she returns her eyes to the page reading artlessly aloud
placing odd stresses on phrases that were never meant to be
stressed

AISSA
‘Twas brillig and the slithy toves
Did gyre and gimble on the wabe
All mimsy were the borogroves
and the mome raths outgrabe

As she finishes MLing crosses to her holding his hands like a
rabbit and mustering a rabbit like expression in his face

AISSA
(acting anxious)
Oh Rabbit its so hard to understand but it
seems somebody killed something

MLing mimes removing a watch from his vest

MLING
By my ears and whiskers Im late Im late The
Duchess will be in such a state

MONTGOMERY
(affectionately)
What a crew Ya gotta love ‘em

Prendick lingers for an instant fixing on Aissa
Montgomery glances back noting his expression

CUT TO
INT THE GUEST ROOM - DAY

Montgomery leads Prendick across the hall to the open door of a
small apartment plainly but comfortably furnished

Some clothes have been laid out for Prendick and there is a filled
bookshelf which Prendick studies for a moment

There is a low bed in the darkest corner of the room shrouded in
mosquito netting and a small barred window looking out towards the
sea

PRENDICK
Barred windows You dont trust the locals
MONTGOMERY
You dont like your room

PRENDICK
Whats the update on the COMSAT equipment

MONTGOMERY
Not my area of expertise

At that moment a third figure appears in the doorway An agitated-
looking ISLANDER dressed in a surgical smock

WAGGDI
Mr Montgomery Sir you must come at once The
contractions have started

MONTGOMERY
Thank you Waggdi Im on my way
(To Prendick)
Oh Christ here we go again

He steps lightly out of the room drawing the door shut behind him

Just before it closes Prendick catches a glimpse of Montgomerys
face through the narrowing crack

MONTGOMERY
Sorry about this Eddie

Prendick starts towards him but Montgomery closes the door in his
face and he hears the SOUND OF A KEY being turned

PRENDICK
Hey Montgomery Cmon open the damn door

MONTGOMERY
Its for your own good

Prendick rattles the door furiously

PRENDICK

Come on Montgomery If its about the damned

insurance Ill sign a waver Shit
He turns to face the room the barred window the brilliant
sunlight and the green fans of the trees beyond Suddenly a
piercing howl of pain comes from somewhere outside Prendicks eyes
search the surrounding jungle for the source but there
is nothing

CUT TO
INT THE GUEST ROOM - DUSK (A LITTLE LATER)

Prendick sits on the bed glancing through a pile of dog-eared
magazines that are on the table beside the bed As he takes another
TIME he reacts to the cover A picture of Moreau surrounded by a
tableau of helixes and medallions with profiles of Nobel

We see him flip through the pages to the article which is
headlined Moreau Future hopes or fears

Prendick tries to read as the howl comes again followed by others
Some creature in agony perhaps closer to death than before as they
build to such an exquisite expression of suffering that it is as
though all the pain in the world had found a single voice

He drops the magazine and goes to the window As he looks out into
the crepuscular gloom of the jungle the howls diminish and
gradually stop Prendick goes to the bed and lies down releived by
the returned silence of the approaching night

Through drifting mosquito netting
DISSOLVE TO

We see the following (PRENDICKS P0V) as though through a
nightmare

Prendick is alone deep in sleep through which he can hear the
SCREAMS now at an unbearable pitch

INT THE WOMB - NIGHT

An unborn CHILD pushes through the red-veined darkness eyes still
closed squeezed shut as if anguished by this transition from one
world to another

In the darkness of the womb the child twists and SCREAMS

CUT TO

INT THE GUEST ROOM - NIGHT

Prendick sits bolt upright on the bed It takes him only a moment
to realize that the pitch of the cries has changed They no longer
sound like the howling of man nor beast but have become instead
the screams of a child in pain
Prendick turns and goes to the door a bit unsteadily He tries it
Still locked

Kneeling down he examines the old style lock In reaction to
something hes seen he reaches to a hat stand beside the door and
removes a wire coat hanger Quickly bending it he pokes it into
the lock and works it around A few thrusts and he forces the key
out the other side It clangs on the hallway floor

Making a hook out of one end of the hanger he slides it under the
door and draws it back with the key

The screaming subsides as Prendick unlocks the door and opens it
After a beat of hesitation he exits into the empty hallway

CUT TO
INT DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY - PRE-DAWN

Prendick comes down a stairway into the empty gloom of the house
He moves along toward a large window that opens off the hallway

Peering out Prendick sees --
EXT A KITCHEN COURTYARD - PRE-DAWN

In the dim light of morning Azazello is cutting up the skinned and
gutted rabbit which bears a disturbing resemblance to the fetus of
Prendicks nightmare

The kitchen courtyard is an area nearly touched by the surrounding
growth of the jungle As Azazello works he reacts to an animal
movement in the surrounding brush A vague shadowy face appears
staring at the preparation of the meat

AZAZELLO
Get away

Azazello pitches a stone The face disappears and the creature
retreats noisily into the brush

INT HALLWAY - PRE-DAWN

Another scream is heard from outside the hduse and Prendick moves
on

CUT TO
EXT THE COMPOUND - JUST BEFORE DAWN

Prendick stands in the lighted doorway of the big house for a
moment realizing now that the cries are coming from the lighted
complex of Nissan huts across the yard
PRENDICK
Moreau

As he starts toward the huts Aissa emerges from the shadows of the
porch Knowing his purpose she takes his arm

AISSA
Oh no please You cant

PRENDICK
Thats a child screaming

AISSA
Its forbidden to go there

PRENDICK
What the hell are they doing Someones being
tortured

Prendick starts towards the source of the screams breaking free of
Aissa who does not dare to follow him further

Behind the house he stumbles across the pile of baseball
equipment gloves a catchers mask some bats He grabs a bat and
goes on

AISSA
No Prendick You cant go there Its the House
of Pain

CUT TO
INT THE LABORATORY - JUST BEFORE DAWN

Prendicks entrance is drowned out by the clamoring of caged
animals going mad with fear at the sound of the screaming child

He stalks slowly down an aisle between the cages baseball bat
raised looking around in the light of the naked bulbs overhead
noting the occupants of the cages Dogs monkeys big and small
cats and in the last of the cages the black leopard lying on its
side and panting as if desperately ill

He sees movement up ahead and his knuckles whiten on the handle of
the bat

Beyond the cages is a laboratory area a maze of computer consoles
and arcane apparatus linked by suspended tubes and cabling to a row
of glass tanks and glowing incubators At the far end of the
laboratory area a group of figures in stained surgical smocks are
ringed about an eccentric custom-built operating table

The figures shift slightly and for a moment Prendick catches a
glimpse of hairy legs that might be human fastened to raised steel
stirrups that have more in common with medieval torture than
obstetrics Then Moreau completely absorbed watches as Montgomery
draws a vinyl sheet across a body obscuring it from view

Moreau turns from the table and Prendick sees at last where the
cries are coming from

Moreau is cradling a screaming mutant child in his arms
A wriggling squalling thing more dog than man umbilical cord
still dangling from its distended belly eyes already open and

hideously aware

Prendick staggers back with a groan and Moreau catches sight of
him his face growing white and terrible

PRENDICK
(shuddering)
Oh my God

Montgomery sees him

MONTGOMERY
Oh shit

Montgomery starts forward trying to come between Prendick and
Moreau Prendick takes a defensive stance with the bat

PRENDICK
Stay the hell away from me

MONTGOMERY
Whatever you think is going on here youre
wrong

PRENDICK

You sick bastards

Prendick retreats toward the exit brandishing the bat to keep them
at bay

He backs into a large assemblage of tubes and glass retorts which
crashes to the floor Monkeys shriek and animal sound erupt from
all sides as Prendick totally freaked beats a retreat to the
door

CUT TO
EXT COMPOUND - DAWN
As Prendick backs out the door he is touched from behind by Aissa
who startles him He spins and nearly swings on her with the bat
She cowers Prendick reaches out and takes her wrist

Aissa stares at him wide eyed as he pulls her away from the lab

CUT TO
INT THE LABORATORY - DAWN

Moreau places the mutant infant on a scale He speaks to
Montgomery

MONTGOMERY
Hes freaked Youll have to talk him down

MOREAU
(nods )
Find him

CUT TO
EXT THE COMPOUND - DAWN

Prendick leads Aissa to an area of tropical overgrowth near the
main house

PRENDICK
Listen youve got to help me I have to get

away from here

AISSA
I cant help you Youve broken the Law

PRENDICK
Ive broken the law What law

AISSA
I dont know what to do Hes my father Im

afraid

She takes Prendicks hand holds it

PRENDICK
Just show me the way out of here and Ill take
care of you I promise

Aissa looks with terrible confusion at the house

PRENDICK
Aissa theres no time Theyll be coming
after me

Aissa grabs his hand They break into a run Aissa stops and turns
once looking back at the house with some incredible longing Then
she runs on

Montgomery comes dashing out of the laboratory and tries to
intercept them but Prendick swings the baseball bat at his face
and he ducks out of the way stumbles back and falls

MONTGOMERY
Eddie Come on dont be an asshole Ill tell
you what its all about

Prendick keeps running following Aissa past the singing aloes
towards the dark wall of the rain forest

MONTGOMERY
Come back Im warning you man theres some
really unstable phenomena out there

Aissa leads Prendick to a section of the fence where the trees have
invaded the compound and he sees a jagged gap in the wire mesh

hidden from the house by luxuriant foliage

He starts through the hole pinning back a loose flap of the fence
with the handle of the baseball bat

CUT TO
EXT THE RAINFOREST - EARLY MORNING

The forest is so dense that after going only a few yards the
compound is already lost from Prendicks sight

AISSA
Where can we go Theyll find us

PRENDICK
We have to get to the launch

AISSA
To the sea Youll take me with you

Prendick looks at her for a moment

PRENDICK
Yes

AISSA
To New York
Prendick almost smiles at her innocence

PRENDICK
Yes New York

They reach the edge of the forest now and through the trees
Prendick can see the dawn coming up over the sparkling ocean Up
ahead the beach seems deserted save for two sleeping ISLANDERS who
lie some way off beside the smoking embers of a campfire Prendick
slows looking cautiously around his eyes fixed on the jetty and
the launch bobbing at its moorings

PRENDICK
Well need fuel to make it to the shipping lane
Do you know where they keep the Diesel

Aissa points toward a storage shed well back from the water

AISSA
In that shed

Prendick is about to start towards the shed when the SOUND OF

A TANNOY comes drifting down the beach followed by the low GROWL of
a diesel engine The two sleeping figures beside the camp stir now
starting to their feet and coming to attention

PRENDICK
Shit

He draws back into the undergrowth as the flatbed comes rattling
down the track from the big house Montgomery standing in the back
a loud hailer in one hand The flatbed pulls up beside the jetty
disgorging a host of doglike FIGURES carrying electric cattle
prods They fan out across the beach the rising sun at their backs
while Montgomery bark instructions to them through the loud hailer

MONTGOMERY
The Man from the Sea has broken the Law Find
him for me and bring him back

The two figures beside the campfire prostrate themselves on the
sand crying out in unison
ONLOOKERS
Back to the House of Pain Master To the House
of Pain

Aissa tugs urgently at Prendicks shoulder and he turns following
her deeper into the forest

PRENDICK
Is there anywhere we can hide

AISSA
The village The men there will know what to do

PRENDICK
Who are they Do they work for Moreau

AISSA
They are good You can trust them

Still not totally convinced he can trust her Prendick follows
Aissa weaving through the undergrowth as they climb the flank of a
densely forested ridge Prendick glances around at the vegetation
the rustling and scurrying of myriad unseen lives

They emerge from the trees onto the bank of a shallow stream and
Aissa freezes suddenly in fear

A naked MAN his skin covered in patches of spotted fur crouches
on all fours beside the stream supping up water like an animal He
senses their presence and glances up guiltily his eyes going at
once to Prendick He starts to his feet wiping his mouth and
Prendick sees his lips are rimmed with blood

Prendick takes a step towards him looking him steadfastly in the
eye clutching the baseball bat with both his hands

LO-MAI
No

He turns and goes bounding away through the undergrowth

Prendick startled looks back now to see Aissa sniffing the air
her brow furrowed a curious far-off look in her eyes He follows
her gaze seeing a trail of bright crimson drops dotting the
foliage

The trail leads to the body of a dead rabbit its remains wedged in
the fork of a tree It is one of the rabbits from the beach but it
has been savagely mutilated the carcass glistening with flies

Aissa glances back at Prendick her face growing solemn
AISSA
Hes a bad one that man Hes broken the Law
Hes going back to the House of Pain

A staghound BAYS from somewhere behind them and Prendick glances at
her uneasily Aissa darts forward once more beckoning for him to
follow her
She sets off swiftly through the trees moving at such a quick pace
that Prendick has to struggle hard to keep up with her

AISSA
Quicker you have to run

At length they come to an open space in the forest and Aissa pauses
once more to let him catch up Ahead in the center of the glade
surrounding the fungoid ruins of a huge fallen tree are THREE
TAILED FIGURES more like attenuated sloths walking on their hind
legs than men their naked bodies covered in a fine silvery fur
their long necks surmounted by odd chinless faces and eyes like
dark pools of honey

They are engaged in picking some kind of fruit pulling down
prickly husks from the trees and scooping out the fleshy contents

Prendick looks questioningly at Aissa

AISSA
The Silent Ones They were the first of his
children but he didnt give them speech

Prendick is about to return his attention to the creatures in the
clearing when a FIGURE in a bright Hawaiian shirt steps from the
surrounding undergrowth

ASSASSIMON
You You You You

The furry figures in the glade take fright and go sloping off into
the trees Prendick turns to face the newcomer a curiously simian
individual with long forearms and a heavy brow overshadowing
bright curious eyes

ASSASSIMON
You In the boat

PRENDICK
Right I came in the boat

ASSASSIMON
You play ball with us now
Prendick glances awkwardly at the bat hes holding

ASSASSIMON
Can you hit the ball

PRENDICK
(going with it)
Sure I batted two ninety three when I played
for the Cards

ASSASSIMON
Its good We need a power hitter very much to
hit the long ball
(Smiling conspiratorially)
I am the pitcher My name is Assassimon

AISSA
Hes a Five Man like you

She takes Prendicks hand and holds it out so Assassimon can see
Assassimon counts Prendicks fingers carefully holding out his own
for comparison

ASSASSIMON
It is very good We must tell Kiril

He swings around gesturing for them to follow and then goes
trotting off his hands hanging down and his jaw thrust forward

AISSA
See youre alright here Youll be safe with
me

Prendick turns to Aissa and takes her hand

CUT TO
EXT THE SETTLEMENT - DAY

Drawing nearer Prendick sees that a small village of wooden
shanties and lean-tos made from matted palm fans is hidden amidst
the volcanic boulders Several of the villagers come shambling from
their hovels to watch them as they enter the ravine and a group of
deformed dog-like children follow jibing at their heels

The walls of the ravine shelter are a wasps nest of more complex
mud-walled homes and it is into the doorway of one of those that
Assassimon disappears

Prendick glances around wrinkling his nose at the pungent odor
The ground is covered with decaying fruit pulp and other refuse and
the air here is thick with smoke

Something brushes his leg and he starts violently down to see a dim
pinkish thing resembling a flayed looking child pawing at his
trousers

Assassimon reappears and Aissa tugs him by the arm

AISSA
Here This is our home now

PRENDICK
Oh great Looks like the Hospitality Suite at
the Bronx Zoo

She gives him an uncomprehending almost hurt look

AISSA
What is wrong

PRENDICK
(melting)
Nothing Its fine

She leads him towards the shadowy aperture and he takes a deep
breath

CUT TO
INT KIRILS DEN — DAY

Prendick finds himself in a semi-circular space shaped like the
half of a beehive Rough vessels of lava and wood stand about the
floor and one on a rough stool In the darkest corner of the
chamber sits a shapeless mass of darkness that GRUNTS as Prendick
enters

KIRIL
Hey

Assassimon stands in the dim light of the doorway and holds out a
split coconut to Prendick as he crawls into the other corner to
crouch beside Aissa The little pink Sloth Creature stands peering
in from the aperture and something else with a drab face and
bright eyes comes to stare over its shoulder

KIRIL
Hey

ASSASSIMON
It is a man Look it is a man

KIRIL
Shut up
Kiril pulls himself upright his head brushing the ceiling forcing
him to hold his huge bearish frame in a melancholic stoop

He peers short-sightedly down at Prendick who looks him in the eye
in as friendly a manner as he can muster Kiril rummages in the
shadows beside his bed and produces a battered portable stereo
KIRIL
You have batteries I need the Energizer

PRENDICK
No Im sorry

AISSA
Hes new He came on the ship

KIRIL
Then you must learn the Law

PRENDICK
Thats really not necessary Im a lawyer and
I

KIRIL
(dismissive)
That way

Kiril turns and motions towards a passageway leading deeper into
the hillside

KIRIL
Through thereGo

Prendick starts forward with trepidation

CUT TO
INT THE CAVE - DAY

With Kiril showing the way they enter a corridor that widens and
grows gradually brighter letting out into a huge natural chamber
lit by a fissure open to the sky

The galleries of the cave are lined with crouching FIGURES their
eyes glinting in the half light their outlines made hazy by the
greasy smoke rising from the embers of a fire on the floor beyond
Prendick sees now that the walls of the cave are covered with
elaborate paintings Innumerable twisted stick figures dance across
the rock faces rising from four legs to two from beast to man and
encircling on the far wall a huge rendition of the Tree of Life
the spiralling ladder of the DNA double helices

The bear man turns now towards Prendick who stands awestruck
KIRIL

This is the House of the Law I am the Keeper of
the Way Only a few can ever enter here
Kiril takes down a conch shell that hangs beside the entrance and
placing it to his lips blows a mighty BLAST setting off a
MURMURING that ripples throughout the cavern

A FIGURE appears now before the painted helices stepping into the
shaft of light that falls from the crevice high above A bearded
figure in a stained white suit and battered Panama hat who is
holding a grisly fetish staff

PRENDICK
Moreau

He starts to raise the bat but then sees that it is not the doctor
after all The suit is too filthy and the beard he now realizes is
made from tufts of dyed hair affixed to a painted wooden mask The
mask however fails to disguise the two huge ram horns that curl
from the sides of this grotesque head

SAYER OF THE LAW
Who is there

KIRIL
A Five Man from the sea Hes come to hear the
Law

At this a sudden clamoring of pipes and drums comes from the
gallery above and several of the shadowy figures closest to them
turn towards Prendick crowding around him touching his hair and
clothes taking him by the hands and dragging him further into the
chamber

A corpulent SOW LADY her heavy thighs painted with grey mud
approaches him draping a garland of wild flowers around his neck
She makes as if to embrace him and he recoils in revulsion as
Aissa lashes out at her forcing her to withdraw

AISSA
Get away from him Hes mine

Prendick looks back at her uneasily catching an unmistakable feral
gleam in her eyes There is a lull in the clamoring and the Sayer

of the Law calls attention by banging his fetish staff against the
rocks

SAYER OF THE LAW
Not to walk on all-fours that is the Law
Prendick says nothing Kiril nudges him firmly

KIRIL
Say it

PRENDICK
What

KIRIL
Repeat the law

PRENDICK
(annoyed)
Not to walk on all-fours
(Then after prompting
from Kiril)
That is the Law

The crowd echoes his words and the ceremony begins

The Sayer of the Law intones the mad litany line by line and the
crowd repeats it swaying from side to side and beating their
hands on their knees

ALL
Not to walk on all-fours that is the Law Are
we not men Not to suck up drink that is the
Law Are we not men Not to eat flesh nor fish
that is the Law Are we not men Not to claw the
bark of trees that is the Law Are we not men
Not to chase other men that is the Law Are we
not men Not to couple any which-way that is
the Law Are we not men

Prendick is transfixed by this powerful and moving travesty of
human ritual He stares amazed as the crowd sways faster and
faster There is a loud MUSICAL PUNCTUATION from the upper gallery
and the chanting swings to a new formula

SAYER OF THE LAW
The punishments of those who break the Law are
terrible None escape

ALL
None escape His is the House of Pain His is
the Hand that makes His is the Hand that
wounds His is the Hand that heals None escape

Assassimon comes forward as if to confess to the congregation

ASSASSIMON
None escape See I did a wrong thing once it
was a little thing I jabbered I stopped

talking No one could understand me Look (He
holds out his hand) I am burned branded here
on the hand And now I talk He is great He is
good

SAYER OF THE LAW
Sooner or later every one will want a thing
that is bad What you will want we do not know
Some want to follow things that move to watch
and slink and spring to kill and bite bite
deep and rich sucking all the warm blood It
is bad Not to chase other men that is the Law
Are we not men Not to eat flesh nor fish
never that is the Law Are we not men To
couple only with one that is the Law

The congregation is hypnotized by the ritual of this

SAYER OF THE LAW
Some go scratching at the graves of the dead
some go fighting with foreheads or claws some
bite suddenly without or warning some go
snuffing at the earth some love uncleanness
some make wild and random fornications every
which-wayit is bad

ASSASSIMON
None escape

Suddenly there the SOUND OF GUNFIRE is heard outside A murmuring
starts amongst those assembled and above their voices Prendick
hears the distant BAYING of staghounds

ASSASSIMON
Hes coming He’s coming

There is a cacophonic CLASH OF PERCUSSION from the upper gallery
and the entire congregation starts towards the door at once ina
furry tumult of struggling misshapen forms almost trampling
Prendick underfoot

He swiftly loses sight of Kiril and Aissa allowing the crowd to
suck him towards the door hearing now the SOUND of the loud hailer
come from somewhere outside

CUT TO
EXT THE SETTLEMENT — DAY

Prendick bursts blinking into the daylight the last stragglers of
the congregation still lurching past him to join the crowd that is
gathering at the mouth of the canyon
Prendick pushes through them peering over the hunched shoulders
and pointed ears to see a nightmarish procession approaching

It is led by Moreau cantering astride the horse his awful face
shadowed by the brim of his Panama hat a bullwhip in his hands a
hunting rifle in a scabbard the villagers supplicating themselves
before him throwing dust over their heads and laying palm fans
before the horses hooves as he rides into the settlement Moreau
is flanked by a retinue of DOG MEN who carry whips as well as by
MLing Waggdi and Azazello who control the leashes of the
snarling staghounds

Montgomery walks sullenly behind them a gun in one hand and the
loud hailer in the other

Prendick turns to see that his way back through the canyon is
blocked by more of the villagers He ducks down trying to hide
himself in the crowd

Beyond the huts the wall of the rainforest is tantalizingly close
yet hopelessly far away Moreau is almost parallel with him now
his eyes like splinters of ice as he surveys the crowd Behind him
Montgomery raises the loud hailer

MONTGOMERY
I know hes in there Better give him up I mean
now

SAYER OF THE LAW
Evil is he who breaks the Law

MONTGOMERY
And you know what happens when you break the
law dont you You shaggy little fucker

ALL (CHORUS)
Back to the House of Pain Back to the House of
Pain Master

MONTGOMERY
You got it boys and girls back to the House
of Pain Come on now Where is he

The villagers slowly turn their snouts towards Prendick who tries
to make a run for it dashing his shoulder into one clumsy figure

and flinging him forward into another

The little pink Sloth Creature grasps at his legs and he delivers a
savage blow to its face with the baseball bat

MOREAU
STOP HOLD HIM

He looks with incredible severity at Aissa She looks imploringly
back

AISSA
Father please

Moreau smiles tenderly at her then turns sharply away

Hands clutch at Prendick He pitches headlong through the crowd and
tackles Montgomery both of them going down almost beneath the
horses hooves grappling desperately for the gun

MONTGOMERY
God Eddie youre turning into a real pain in
the ass We just want to

Prendick strikes him on the jaw and wrestling his fingers from the
trigger guard regains his feet just as the Dog Men come loping up
to him brandishing their cattle prods He raises the gun firing a
round into the air

PRENDICK
Back You fucking freaks

He fires another round and Moreaus horse panics rearing
dangerously and causing the Dog Men to scatter

Prendick turns and makes a break for it sprinting across a millet
patch towards the shelter of the trees where he turns and fires
another shot while Moreau struggles to get his horse back under
control

CUT TO
EXT THE RAINFOREST - DAY

Prendick runs full tilt through the undergrowth the automatic
clutched in one hand the air behind him filled with threatening
cries and the baying of staghounds He zig-zags through the trees
pausing and changing course as he hears BRANCHES CRACKING up ahead
then turning again as he hears Moreau and Montgomery SHOUTING from
somewhere behind him and the NEIGHING of the horse

Some of the islanders are ROARING AND SCREAMING now like beasts of
prey as they hurl themselves after him through the foliage
primitive cudgels clasped in their hands

As Prendick forces his way through the thick undergrowth of the
forest shadow figures brachiate through the trees above him
WHOOPING HOWLING GIBBON-LIKE BEAST MEN quickly overtake him and
cut off his escape menacing him from the canopy above
Prendick turns and fights through a tangled thicket of thorns
toward a break in the trees

Breaking from the undergrowth which tears at his clothes he
reaches the edge of a narrow gully and falls headlong into the
steaming waters of a murky sulphurous stream The gun falls into
the muck The sound of the pursuing dogs grows louder as he gets to
his feet Gasping with pain as the steaming mud clings to his
flesh

Shoving his hands into the sulfureous mud to find the gun he is
forced to withdraw them quickly before they are cooked by the
viscous almost boiling water Suddenly a HYENA-SWINE MAN breaks
from the surrounding brush and seeing Prendick gives a loud roar

As the creature lunges into the mud Prendick stumbles away
bleeding profusely now from a wound in his scalp

The YELPING of the dogs and Dogmen and a CHATTERING AND A GIBBERING
followed by the CRACK of a whip and VOICES

Prendick sets off again splashing ankle deep through the scalding
water crying out to himself as he runs seeing the blue line of
the ocean now through the trees

CUT TO
EXT BEACH - LATE AFTERNOON

Prendick splashes across the delta and does not stop running until

he is up to his knees in salt water staring out at the setting sun
and the unreachable horizon He turns westward stumbling along the
waters edge

Then suddenly far in front of him he sees figures emerging from
the rainforest Moreau on his horse then Montgomery then some of
the Dog Men with their snapping charges They see him and begin
advancing

Prendick starts to turn only to see a posse of villagers emerging
from the tree line behind him to cut him off

He looks towards the horizon once more and having nowhere else
left wades straight out into the water

Moreau addresses him from the waters edge
Aissa stands beside him frightened and confused
MOREAU

Mr Prendick pleaseTheres no escape from
here
His eyes wander over the massed ranks over Aissa and MLing
Waggdi and Azazello and further up the beach Assassimon Kiril and
the others

PRENDICK
They were men But youve mutilated them made
slaves of them

MOREAU
Thats not it at all Youve got it wrong

Prendick shouts at the gathering

PRENDICK
Listen Theres a hundred of you and two of
them You have nothing to fear from them You
dont need to obey

MOREAU
Prendick

The islanders seem puzzled staring wonderingly at Prendick They
edge closer to the tide line and Moreau cracks his whip causing
them to retreat once more

PRENDICK
These men arent gods You have the power to
free yourselves

MONTGOMERY
Back off man Dont start something that might
end in tears

Moreau moves his horse forward When he is near Prendick he
indicates the rifle in its saddle scabbard

MOREAU
Mr Prendick this rifle is loaded Please take
it
Prendick hesitates
MOREAU
Take the rifle and put your mind at ease We are

not the enemy It mustnt appear that theres
conflict between us

Cautiously Prendick moves towards him and slips the rifle from the
scabbard He aims it at Moreau who nudges his horse closer
MOREAU
(whispering fiercely)
Those are not men Do you understand me Theyre
Chromatic hybrids experiments in a humanizing
process Dont excite them or it could be bad
for all of us

PRENDICK
Theyre animals

MOREAU
Please Mr Prendick theyre not without
sensitivity

Montgomery moves towards them Prendick swings the rifle to cover
them both but he comes slowly closer

MONTGOMERY
Eddie we hunted you for your own good This
island is full of unstable phenomena
MOREAU

You might not have survived the night

PRENDICK
That woman I saw on the operating table

MOREAU
You didnt see a woman What you saw was not a
human Youre certainly entitled to ethical
reservations about our research but at least
hear us out

MONTGOMERY
Cmon Eddie stop pointing that thing at my
head

MOREAU

We mean you no harm Our only intention is to
get you safely on your way

PRENDICK
Oh right but I suppose the COMSAT equipment
is still down

MOREAU
Yes it is down Do you want to know the reason
Theres been a nuclear exchange between India
and Pakistan We heard it on the short wave
radio
Prendick is stricken

MOREAU
All COMSAT communication is restricted to
military usage

Prendick looks away at the distant sea trying to imagine the world
beyond the island

PRENDICK
A war

MOREAU
So far its only the rumble of a distant storm
but it brings a new imperative to our
survival to the work we do

CUT TO
INT LABORATORY - DUSK

Moreau gingerly lifts the vinyl sheet and Prendick peers down with
distaste bordering on revulsion at the mutilated body strapped to
the operating table The automatic is still clutched in his hand

Moreau watches him cooly

MOREAU
You tell me is that human

PRENDICK
I dont know what she is

MOREAU
Actually shes a genetic hybrid We call them
Chimaeras

Prendick looks uncomprehendingly at him

PRENDICK
Very poetic What does it mean
MOREAU
Animals engineered in the image of humans

PRENDICK
Ive always heard you people are desperate for
grant money But animals into humans dont you
think thats a reach

Moreau draws the sheet over the womans remains again and turns
away from the operating table Prendick follows
MOREAU
If Im to to succeed at improving mandkind then
what I create must have human form

PRENDICK
Youll only succeed in filling tabloid
headlines Theres no market for home made
people Creating these things is immoral

MOREAU
War and death generated by the twisted laws of
nations is that the moral highground

Prendick has no response Moreau rubs his eyes wearily

MOREAU
I cant believe Im having to explain myself
like this Montgomery told me what you did I
hoped you believed that humanity can be
improved

PRENDICK
I dont see this as improving it

MOREAU
Why not Ive improved other living things
created wheat that grows in the Sahara other
plants that kill and eat their own predators
Everything has to start with basics like
creating a new race without the evil or venality
of our species

PRENDICK
This half dissected thing was sacrificed to that
goal

MOREAU

Growth must be accelerated centuries of
evolution compressed into minutes the process
takes its toll on the organism

PRENDICK
And the screams

MOREAU
Deliberate pain serves only as a training tool
It will fall away from us one day along with
its depraved twin pleasure

Prendick gives him a sharp look

MOREAU
Why do you doubt me Mr Prendick because you
failed improve humanity with laws

PRENDICK
I only set out to solve a few local problems I
leave improvements on the human race to a higher

authority

MOREAU
I choose to believe that authority works through
me pushes me to finish my work

Moreau stops by the pen that holds the black leopard from the boat
The animal is comatose now its belly already hideously distended
kept alive only by nutrients fed directly into its veins by a row
of drips

MOREAU
I chose this creature for its strength to
withstand the rigors of accelerated fetal
growth

PRENDICK
Its not doing well Maybe you chose wrong

MOREAU
Shes being devoured by a fetus growing at over
fifty times the normal rate Her life will end
to give new life That seems cruel to you
doesnt it

PRENDICK
Yes it does

MOREAU
And to me But I have no choice My own clock
runs at accelerated speed I must finish before
Im finished
(passionately)
And Im close Im very closeShes going to
me my breakthrough I know it

CUT TO
INT LABORATORY - DUSK
Moreau dons a curious pair of goggles He hands a pair to Prendick

MOREAU
Do you know the term nanotechnology

PRENDICK
I know enough Greek to know nano means small

MOREAU
Very small It involves mechanically shifting
things on a molecular level

Moreau demonstrates the laboratorys centerpiece a combined laser
and electron microscope its needle thin blue beam focused minutely
on a tiny slide its glow bathing the room in an eerie bluegreen
luminescence

MOREAU
Nanotechnology enables us to isolate and
transfer specific gene sequences Then through
artificial insemination and surrogacy we can
create hybrids that would be impossible in
conventional crossbreeding

The beam of the laser moves down into a subatomic world that is
suddenly ablaze with light Rising before them are the spiralling
helices of the DNA molecule the fundamental building block of life
spinning in the lasers glare

MOREAU
My work will form the basis of a renaissance in genetic
engineering that will transform the new century

CUT TO
INT THE LAB - A MONITOR - NIGHT

We are watching the early days of the experiment Moreau younger
now oversees the work of a chain-smoking behaviorist

MOREAU
I won’t bore you with our early efforts
Basically we moved through herbivores to
carnivores to capitalize on the intelligence
that goes with predation Then taking a
gorilla I made my first Man

The videotape CUTS to a shaky handheld SHOT of a squat dark-
skinned APE MAN walking on the front lawn holding hands with

Moreau

MOREAU
Everything our race has forgotten is being found
again here on this island as if for the very
first time Thats Prima our first real
success We took him from the surrogate mother
at birth and raised him here in the compound
Dr Conway was with me then

Prendick watches now as an attractive chain-smoking woman DR
CONWAY submits Prima to a battery of intelligence tests
flashcards and reading-readiness tests

MOREAU
By the age of five Prima could speak English at
least as well as the average human child of the
same age Conway was incredibly gifted in
communicating with him

Dr Conway holds up a drawing of a suburban street All appears
normal in the picture save for the presence of a car with square
wheels and an elegant-looking woman who is strolling down the
sidewalk with a tiger on a leash

DR CONWAY (ON TAPE)
Now Prima can you see anything wrong with this
picture

Prima scratches his head

DR CONWAY (ON TAPE)
Come on Prima Big thinks baby Big thinks

Prima extends his hand to touch the square wheel but ignores
the tiger

PRIMA (ON TAPE)
Car

DR CONWAY (ON TAPE)
Ver-ry good
She makes a mark in her notebook the shadow of a frown crossing
her face

MOREAU
Its impossible really to gauge non-human

intelligence by human standards

Moreaus eyes shine with intense feeling as he watches Conway on
the screen

MOREAU
Conway worked tirelessly with them She was so
dedicated inspired

Dr Conway produces another drawing a depiction of several
objects a house a chair a tree a flower and a hat

DR CONWAY (ON TAPE)
Now Prima which one do you go to when theres
a storm When its wet and raining

PRIMA (ON TAPE)
Tree

He touches the drawing and Dr Conway shakes her head

DR CONWAY (ON TAPE)
No Prima You go to the house when it rains

Prima frowns and bows his head his shoulders hunched

PRIMA (ON TAPE)
Damn me good

Prima takes one of Dr Conway’s cigarettes and lights it smoking
nervously as though afraid it might be taken from him

MOREAU
Today the population of our island stands at
more than sixty Thats not counting the
creatures without human speech or form
Altogether Ive made more than a hundred and
twenty some had to be destroyed

Prendick reacts to this word

PRENDICK
What happened to Dr Conway

MOREAU
Dr Conway died
The video images give way to scenes of carnage the laboratory
floor awash with blood

MOREAU

(with difficulty)
An experiment that got out of control A thing
with a human face that moved like a snake
Incredibly strong enraged by the pain of its
creation It killed her here then escaped We
cornered it and destroyed it in the northern
part of the island In the chaos other creatures
escaped as well Regrettably there was some
hybridization beyond my control

Moreau reaches for the remote control and stops the tape

MOREAU
Her death was a personal tragedy for me I must
see that it wasnt for nothing

PRENDICK
The people who fund you know nothing of this

MOREAU
The Foundation for the Humanities Surely you
know of them

PRENDICK
(bothered)
Theyve sponsored UN work involving human rights

MOREAU
Including your own

Prendick says nothing but its probably true

PRENDICK
Arent you ever afraid

MOREAU
Of what

PRENDICK
That you’re going too far That you’ve already
gone too far

This slightly changes the temperature Moreau seems from here on to
be drifting away from Prendick

MOREAU
I was researching It led this way and I
followed it Thats what good science is Mr
Prendick It takes a man way beyond fear

A feral CHITTERING comes from behind him now and Moreau glances
around On a bookshelf an arms reach away two tiny hunchbacked
mice men their bodies covered in a fine brown fur are squaring
off over a mate One of the mice men picks up a pin and shakes it
at his companion emitting a threatening SQUEAK
MOREAU
On occasion I succeed I bring them very close
to real humanity But unless instinct is
controlled chemically or with pain the animal
returns But I will eventually prevail Violence
will be channelled into courage and duty
Sexuality transmuted into religious ecstasy The
potential for refinement is limitless

He seems to no longer be speaking to Prendick or to anybody else
The black leopard WHIMPERS softly from somewhere deep in its
trance Moreau faces Prendick He seems weary

MOREAU
Youve heard it all Mr Prendick I have no
more secrets

CUT TO
EXT THE COMPOUND - DUSK

We see a time lapse view of the enclosure as dusk shelves off into
night the Plant People creeping across the lawn trying to flee
the lengthening shadows Their SINGING gradually dies away and they
draw their branches tight around themselves as the night deepens
and the lights come on behind them in the big house

The sound of a CNN broadcast can be heard intoning World News

CNN(OS)

Reports have put casualties as high as six
hundred thousand in what is now the third day of
continuous conflict

CUT TO
INT PRENDICKS ROOM - DUSK

Prendick is on his bed watching a small portable TV on the bedside
table Aissa steps silently into the room Apparently uninterested
in the TV she watches Prendick

CNN(OS)

Emergency sessions of the UN Security Council
have brought no promise of a truce but an
increasing threat that neighboring nations may
join the conflict For an on scene assessment we
go to Molly Zuckerman in Kabul

Prendick settles back on the bed and Aissas hand reaches and turns
the TV off He lies in the near darkness over preferring the
sighing song of the plants and wild animal noises to the voice from
the world beyond
As his gaze drifts to the open door of his room the sight of
something brings a trace of smile to his face

Aissa stands at the doorway watching him in large-eyed silence

Prendick extends his hand Aissa pads quietly into the room and
takes his gazing down at him on the bed

AISSA
Are you sad Prendick

PRENDICK
Sad

AISSA
Sad about what has happened in the world you
came from

PRENDICK
It seems a long way off

AISSA
It doesnt matter what happens out there

Aissa smiles and gently rubs the back of his hand against her
cheek

AISSA
Is there some one you miss

PRENDICK
No one special Aissa

AISSA
And you no longer wish to runaway to New
York

Prendick looks into her eyes

PRENDICK
Sit here

Aissa settles on the bed still holding Prendicks hand
AISSA
Even if you dont run away you will go someday

and leave me

PRENDICK
(smiles)
Hey didnt I make you a promise about New York

AISSA
That was only to get me to help you That was a
lie

Seeing her feeling her caress Prendick is very aroused His
gently cups her chin then gently draws her lips to a tender kiss
Their lips part and Prendick whispers softly

PRENDICK
That was then This is not a lie

His lips again touch hers Their mouths open and with the slightest
touches of lips and tongue tips they taste each others taste
Prendick sighs as he traces the strange sensual contours of her
mouth

His hands barely brush the top of her sarong and it drops away
revealing small firm perfect breasts Aissa arches her back with
a sudden rush of feeling as Prendicks palms gently brush her erect
nipples

In sudden arousal Aissa’s hands search down Prendicks body inside
his shirt agile fingers glide down his chest to find the hairy
centerline of his muscular abdomen He guides her hand further
forcing an awareness of his desire Aissa gasps perhaps with fear
of the unknown or perhaps with instinctual longing

While she kisses him Prendicks hands settle on her buttocks and
he positions her over him Then slowly and gently he settles her
loins to his own Aissa whimpers at sensations that are both new
and part of her basic desire Both she and Prendick are caught up
and equal in their pleasure Their movements reflect intense hunger
for more of what they both are feeling Thought is abolished by the
frantic pulses of instinct

Prendicks kisses Aissas shoulders and neck tasting the flavor
and texture of her skin the soft curves of her musculature Then
his lips find the hard bud of her nipple and the pleasure is beyond
control

Aissa feels a current course her body She stretches forward lying
atop Prendick with her arms extended above his head As she
releases a feral cry which excites Prendicks own release her
hands clutch the bedding her nails extend from her fingers and she
draws them down in catlike expression of her orgasm They have
become claws that tear long deep rents in the sheets
A figure watching from the shadows of the hallway turns and moves
away as the lovers settle exhausted into each others arms

CUT TO
INT THE LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Moreau sits at the piano playing out the gentle layers of
Gnossienne No-l by Satie His expression is distant wistful lost
somewhere in his own past

CUT TO
INT THE BEDROOM - NIGHT

The door to the bathroom is open Prendick watches as Aissa steps
from the shower and begins toweling herself dry As he watches her
she licks her palms and runs her hands quickly through her hair in
a distinctly cat-like gesture of grooming Prendicks gaze lowers
to the bed to the rents torn into the bedding by her nails

PRENDICK
Aissa who was your mother

Aissa answers as she steps into the room

AISSA
I dont know

PRENDICK
You dont know

AISSA
I dont remember her He took me away from her
when I was born He said she was from Fiji

For an instant her pointed ears are revealed she shakes her long

hair down over her shoulders covering them She looks down at him
nervously

AISSA
Why do you ask me this
Prendick says nothing

AISSA
Im as human as you are

Prendick looks at her unable to eliminate the question of her
origins from his mind
AISSA
(deeply earnest in tears)
Prendick I love you Is this the way an animal
behaves Do animals cry

PRENDICK
I dont know Aissa But Im not sure it matters

He reaches out to her and holds her As she cuddles in his arms
speaks

AISSA
He will never use me like he has used the others If I
ever pregnant it will be by you

Off Prendicks look

CUT TO
EXT THE VERANDAH - NIGHT

Like characters from a Conrad novel Montgomery and Moreau are
finishing drinks MLing comes out with a tray As he takes up
their glasses Moreau preps a cheroot

MOREAU
Personally I think that what goes on in that
village like some grotesque cartoon of the human
condition

MONTGOMERY
Being a bit hard on them dont you think

MOREAU
Id rather he hadnt seen it

MLing having cleared the drinks lights Moreaus cigar then
shambles into the house with his tray

MONTGOMERY
Id rather hed drowned There was no reason to
turn the launch back But you ordered it

Moreau smiles at him

MOREAU
It never hurts to have a fresh view on what one
does and thinks I was intrigued when you told
me what he did I thought he could bring and
interesting perspective to our work

she

am
Aissa moves quietly from a side door of the house She pauses by
the vegetation which surrounds the veranda and listens

MONTGOMERY
He can bring us a shitload of trouble I dont
see him just going on his way and sending us the
occasional postcard

AisSa strains to hear them

MOREAU
I agree his leaving the island could be
problematic

MONTGOMERY
His staying is a problem too Hes knocking toes
with Aissa

Moreaus eyebrows go up in exaggerated surprise

MOREAU
Oh now I know why he suddenly bothers you

MONTGOMERY
Id remind you shes your daughter

MOREAU
Yes theres much of me in her But mainly
because of a shortage of genetic material Im
fond of her but thats all just fond The day
will come when shell be useful as a surrogate
Perhaps he could b e useful too a fresh
source of uncorrupted DNA

Aissa winces as she hears this

MONTGOMERY
So his is Uncorrupted DNA Not very subtle
are we Moreau

MOREAU
Im not being judgmental but I think all those
drugs have left a mark on you

Montgomery stares ahead in obvious jealous rage

MOREAU
Easy now Monty If I could have engineered her
sexual preference Id have put her in your
arms
A gong sounds off screen Moreau rises

MOREAU
Its dinner time

CUT TO
INT THE DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Moreau sits at the head of the long table which has been laid for
dinner holding a cigar Prendick sits across from him while
Montgomery sits somewhere between them

MOREAU
Our islanders have been given speech the
beginnings of a society morality laws

PRENDICK
That chanting is a legal system

MOREAU
Admittedly its primitive but its a beginning
I invite you to improve on it

PRENDICK
Ill leave the drafting of your Bill of Rights
to someone else

MONTGOMERY
Eddie only wants to be involved here in a very
selective way

Prendick senses Montgomerys hostility

MOREAU
Im sorry Mr Prendick declines my offer But I
can create in the laboratory an innate a respect
for law Which is the first facet of a whole and
healthy society

PRENDICK
A whole and healthy society This place doesnt
really have that look

MONTGOMERY
Dont worry Eddie Later well really jazz them
up color co-ordinate them and accesorize

them you wont be able to tell the little
buggers from anybody else youd run into at the
mall

(He looks toward the door)
In fact theres a look you dont mind
Moreau and Prendick turn to see Aissa emerge awkwardly from the
study door followed by Azazello and MLing who carries a steaming
platter of curiously colored vegetables

MOREAU
Ah darling Please come and join us

AISSA
(slightly cool)
Thank you father

Aissa seats herself at the table her eyes downcast

MOREAU
Vegetables Mr Prendick Our own produce We
are all vegetarians here

As Moreau speaks Azazello lays a silver serving dish on the table
and lifts the lid to reveal an ill-cooked rabbit resting on a bed
of herbs

Moreaus eyebrows go up He flashes a look at Montgomery

MOREAU
Montgomery couldnt this have waited

MONTGOMERY
You said I could use my discretion

MOREAU
Your indulgence was to be personal not shared

MONTGOMERY
I felt generous I think sharing the rabbit is a
very civilized gesture dont you Eddie

PRENDICK
No doubt about it Actually you shared one you
dont know about It was in the undergrowth at
the back of the enclosure with its head torn
off

MOREAU
(alarmed and angry)

Torn off Hear that Montgomery

MONTGOMERY
I swear None of them saw me kill

Prendick picks up on the rift between them
Prendick

PRENDICK
Just before I found the rabbit I saw a man
drinking from the stream

MOREAU
Sucking his drink

PRENDICK
Slurping it right up Down on all fours

MOREAU
After a kill they drink It sweetens the salt
taste of blood

MONTGOMERY
Well theres another carnivore out of the
closet So much for the Law and control of baser
instincts Moreau

MOREAU
(to Montgomery )
With you for a role model Im not surprised
(to Prendick)
This man you saw would you know him again

AISSA
Lo-Mai It was Lo-Mai who drank from the stream

MOREAU
Thank you Sweetheart I thought so Well
well have to make an example of him

AISSA
(fiercely rapidly under her
breath like a catechism)
Punishment is swift and sure

stares at her

MOREAU
Ive had my eye on Lo-Mai for awhile Hes been
sloping off with the Hyena- Swine and making all
kinds of trouble Well call a special assembly
tomorrow Mr Prendick identify him Ill ask
you to formally

PRENDICK
Forget it Leave me out of this
MONTGOMERY
Youre a witness man Consider yourself
subpoenaed

MOREAU
(passionately)
Im afraid I cant leave you out of it Just
being here makes you one of us

Moreau stubs out his cigar and gets to his feet

MOREAU
If they get a taste for blood were finished

Moreau leaves the room exchanging a covert conspiratorial look
with MLing Aissa follows

Montgomery glances at Prendick who is picking uneasily at the
rabbit

MONTGOMERY
Hows the rabbit

PRENDICK
A little pink

But Prendicks eyes are on Azazello who is standing in the study
door licking his hands clearly excited by this new and
dangerously addictive taste

CUT TO
EXT THE COMPOUND - NIGHT

Prendick walks out onto the steps of the veranda He stares out at
the distant moonlit sea Hearing something he turns and Aissa
approaches He smiles but her expression is dark Seeing her eyes
which have the faintest trace of glow Prendick reacts

AISSA
Why do you look at me like that

PRENDICK
NothingI

AISSA
You mustnt trust them They are bad men

PRENDICK
Why do you say that
AISSA
They lie I have heard them

PRENDICK
What did they lie about

Aissa steps close to him

AISSA
They will not let you leave ever They will use
you They use everyone

PRENDICK
Aissa do you know how to use the radio

AISSA
Mling knows

CUT TO
INT THE RADIO HUT - NIGHT

MLing sits hunched over a two-way radio wearing an ill-fitting
set of headphones and barking into the transmitter

MLING
This is Biostation Echo Rio Delta calling on all
channels Come in Is anyone receiving me

Prendick seated beside him waits but nothing comes Aissa watches
from the background

MLING
Theres nothing but static Been that way for
five days

Montgomerys voice suddenly booms from the back of the shack

MONTGOMERY
Unless were jamming our own radio to keep you
from leaving

Mling looks suddenly terrified Aissa backs away and Montgomery
steps up to the radio set

MONTGOMERY
Youve got some real paranoia going Eddie Ever
think maybe theres nothing out there anymore
Maybe weve really gone and done it this time
Maybe were the only ones left You and me and
the Doc
PRENDICK
And Aissa

MONTGOMERY
Yeah lets include her Well need a female
entity to start it up again
(He turns to Aissa)
Post-nuclear family values is what were after
here

Aissa backs out the door and Mling retreats to the shadows then
out to the surrounding jungle Montgomery faces Prendick

MONTGOMERY
Theyre always a bit fearful In my opinion the
veggies have corrupted the old mans seed

PRENDICK
Theyre both his children

MONTGOMERY
All his children Since all I do is drag my big
muddy boots in and out of the temple of my body
I guess he figures my DNA wasnt all there

PRENDICK
Who was Aissas mother

MONTGOMERY
(smiles)
Given the oddities of this place its an amazing
thing to speculate about isnt it

Montgomery proffers a joint Prendick is so preoccupied that he
takes a deep drag without realizing it

MONTGOMERY
There you go man Isnt that better than taking
all this shit on the natch

Prendick turns towards the door stepping out into the night Hes
deeply troubled

EXT THE VERANDAH - NIGHT

Aissa is waiting for Prendick in the shadows beside the door As he
approaches she glances up at him her eyes study glistening

AISSA
What did he tell you
PRENDICK
Who

AISSA
Montgomery What did he say about me

PRENDICK
Nothing

AISSA
He told you Im one of them didnt he

Prendick looks hard at her

AISSA
Some kind of animal

Aissa makes a movement that is terrifyingly cat-like her hands
flying towards Prendicks face He grabs her wrists She calms
instantly

PRENDICK
Aissa weve got to get off of this island

AISSA
We can steal the launch

PRENDICK
Its three or four days to New Guinea Well
need diesel and food and water

AISSA
I can get food Theres diesel in the storeroom
Tomorrow night there will be big screen after
the play Everyone will be there That would be
the time

Aissa touches the remote on a CD and the romantic ballad heard
earlier begins

AISSA
Stay with me tonight Prendick
(She takes his hand)
My Five Man We still have time

She moves closer Prendick touches her face and she draws him
gently into her embrace

AISSA
Dance with me Nothing else matters now
And for a while they dance together in the narrow puddle of light
at one end of the long verandah The power of Aissas close
physical presence seems to overwhelm Prendicks concern He looks
into her eyes with an intensity and tenderness that seems beyond
his control Slowly he surrenders to it with one hand he gently
strokes her hair lifts her head back and kisses her softly then
deeply while beyond in the tropical night the howling of some
great unseen beast rises now to greet the moon

CUT TO
EXT THE COMPOUND - DAY

Moreaus flag the emblem of the Tree of Life billows against the
blazing blue sky The sound of a HORN followed by a mounting
CLAMOR of bestial voices

Moreau stands on a wooden rostrum beneath the flagpole the horn
raised to his lips Prendick Montgomery and MLing flanking him
Waggdi Azazello and the other Dog Men are posted around the base
of the rostrum on crowd control duty

At the sound of the horn the Beast Folk bow on their knees and
elbows and begin flinging dust over their heads Montgomery
clipboard in hand checks them off one by one

MONTGOMERY
Sixty-two sixty-three Were coming up short
here

MOREAU

There are four more

PRENDICK
I dont see Lo-Mai

MONTGOMERY
No big surprise there buddy

Moreau sounds the HORN again and the Beast Folk writhe and grovel
with renewed fervor Then slinking through the main gate comes
Lo-Mai and the HYENA-SWINE followed by Assassimon dressed in white
linen trousers The other animals shoot vicious glances at him
Moreau passes the horn to MLing

MOREAU
Silence

The Beast Folk sit back on their haunches now and rest from their
worshipping
MOREAU
Where is my Sayer of the Law

The horned man bows his face to the dust

MOREAU
Say the words

SAYER OF THE LAW
Not to go on all fours that is the Law

The kneeling assembly recites the words after him swaying from side
to side and striking up the dust with their hands

ALL (CHORUS)
Not to go on all-fours that is the Law Are we
not men Not to slurp up drink that is the Law
Are we not men Not to eat flesh nor fish that
is the Law Are we not men

MOREAU
STOP

Silence falls at once

The Beast Folk know whats coming and glance furtively at one
another a feeling of dread creeping over the assembly

MOREAU
That Law has been broken

SAYER OF THE LAW
None escape

ALL (CHORUS)
None escape

MOREAU
Who is he

Moreau CRACKS his whip for effect as Lo-Mai and the Hyena-Swine
glance at each other nervously

MOREAU
WHO IS HE

SAYER OF THE LAW
Evil is he who breaks the Law

Moreau meets Lo-Mais gaze looking him steadfastly in the eye
MOREAU
Whoever breaks the Law goes back to the House of
Pain

ALL (CHORUS)
Back to the House of Pain Back to the House of
Pain O Master

AZAZELLO
(pathetically eagerly)
Back to the House of Pain Back to the House of
Pain

Moreau turns his attention to Lo-Mai once more

MOREAU
Do you hear

The terrified Leopard Man springs to his feet now and leaps
desperately towards the rostrum his eyes aflame a row of ivory
fangs flashing out from beneath his curling lips

Waggdi raises his cattle prod to block the Leopard Mans path but
Lo-Mai sweeps him aside sending him sprawling to the dust yelping
and clutching at his bleeding snout

Azazello and the Hyena-Swine are watching with expressions of pure
malice on their faces They turn to one another conspiratorially
Lo-Mai mounts the rostrum coming face to face now with Moreau who
resolutely stands his ground Moreau looks into the Leopard Mans
eyes and it is as if he is looking into his very soul

MOREAU
My son

Then with a snarl Lo-Mai lunges at Moreau but Azazello strikes him
down with his cattle prod He cringes trying to protect himself as
the Dog Men surround him Azazello pins his arms behind his back
while Waggdi grabs him vengefully by the hair pulling his head
back so that Moreau can look him in the face once more

The Hyena-Swine has been joined by other Chimaera who are watching
with threatening expressions Assassimon looks on with something
close to pity

Lo-Mais eyes are wide and glazed with fear
LO-MAT

(imploringly)
Father
Moreau pats Lo-Mais head soothingly

MOREAU
Its all right my son I forgive you for
everything

With one fluid motion Moreau draws his revolver and puts it to Lo-
Mais head squeezing the trigger There is a deafening concussion
and the Leopard Man falls Assassimon the Hyena-Swine and other
Chimeras recoil as if theyve been shot too

For a moment all is quiet

MONTGOMERY
(almost to himself with bitterness)
Hes with the program nowhes really a
believer now man

Moreau gives him a hard look then looks to the Sayer of the Law

SAYER OF THE LAW
The gun has spoken It is good

AZAZELLO
Hallelujah

Assassimon the Hyena-Swine and the Chimaera standing with them are
looking on with undisguised hatred now

Prendick looks in mounting horror from Azazello who is already
bending over Lo-Mais twitching body as if excited by the smell of
his blood to Moreau who stands over them the smoking gun in his
hand his white suit specked with blood his eyes filled with cold
fire the VOICES of the chanting congregation rising around him

ALL (CHORUS)
His is the hand that wounds His is the hand
that heals flash His is the lightning His is
the House of Pain

Prendick stares in horror

Assassimon the Hyena-Swine and the others look meaningfully at
each other

CUT TO
EXT THE COMPOUND - MID-AFTERNOON

Prendick stands waist-high in a field of marijuana plants watching

as the ball game gets under way on the front lawn Assassimon
coming up to bat Beside him Azazello and Montgomery his long
hair tied back by a greasy bandana are busy watering the plants

There is a CRACK of wood against horsehide followed by a

spattering of APPLAUSE and Montgomery glances up in time to see the

Monkey Man reaching first base
Montgomery plucks a joint from his bandana and fires it up

MONTGOMERY
Assassimons in his element Fantastic
knuckleball But then look at his knuckles Oh
shit Here comes trouble

Prendick follows Montgomerys gaze to see Kiril and the Hyena-
Swine wading towards them through the marijuana field

KIRIL
Hail to the Other with the whip

MONTGOMERY
Hail to you too Theres a Third with a whip
now so youd better watch yourself

HYENA-SWINE
Was he not made He said he said he was made

KIRIL
The Third with the whip he that walks weeping
into the sea has a long thin face

MONTGOMERY
He has a long thin whip and it hurts

KIRIL
Yesterday he bled and wept

HYENA-SWINE
You never bleed or weep The Master does not
bleed or weep

MONTGOMERY
Youll fucking bleed and weep if you dont shut

up

He turns away passing the joint to Azazello The Dog Man smokes
greedily

it
PRENDICK
You think thats a good idea

MONTGOMERY
I dont know Maybe Im too liberal

PRENDICK
I dont think you know what youre doing That
was a crazy fucking thing showing Azazello how
to skin and gut a rabbit

MONTGOMERY
Well shit Its not like he killed the damned
thing He gets to have a few perks too He
works hard Dont you Azazello old sock old
buddy you’re a goddamned good old son-of-a-
bitch

He scratches Azazello behind the ear calling him jocular names as
the Dog Man fawns on him in extraordinary delight

AZAZELLO
Yes yes most certainly so Master

Azazello passes the joint to the Hyena-Swine

KIRIL
The Law says you must not destroy life

MONTGOMERY
Yeah thats right You know it is

KIRIL
None must not take another life but you By
the waterYou

MONTGOMERY
I what You fuzzy bastard

Kiril makes the motion of breaking the rabbits neck and gives an
incredibly accurate imitation of its scream

There is an awkward silence as Montgomery meets Kirils gaze the
Hyena-Swine watching them intently Behind them the BISON MAN steps
onto the pitchers mound Going to the plate Assassimon holds the
bat unsteadily in his hands

MONTGOMERY
Are you judging me Are you fucking daring to
compare yourself to me
KIRIL
No no Everyone does it sometime I turn over a
rock once in a while and lap up an insect or
two

MONTGOMERY
Insects dont really count Everybody kills them

PRENDICK
Yeah But we dont all necessarily eat them

The Bison Man pitches the ball at Assassimon striking him in the
head with a resounding CRACK

BISON MAN
Howzat

There is a raucous clamoring of JEERS AND APPLAUSE as Waggdi and
the Sloth Man pick up Assassimons twitching body and carry him off
the field

BISON MAN
How was that

Prendick turns his eyes towards the middle distance where
Assassimon lies in the arms of the FOX LADY while the Sloth Man
dabs ineffectually at his bleeding head Out on the field with the
game interrupted the Bison Man starts to run around and around the
bases a relentless force of nature scuffing up dust in the lazy
afternoon air

He looks to the Hyena-Swine who is watching him with a barely
concealed menace

CUT TO
EXT THE COMPOUND - DUSK

Prendick stares out across the compound towards the jetty and the
launch that will take him to freedom beyond the fiery rim of the
setting sun Then he sees the figure of Moreau in his white suite
standing at the end of the jetty his eyes turned towards the same
horizon A small posse of Beast Folk crouch at a respectful
distance behind him watching in bewilderment as if incapable of
understanding what holds their masters attention

Prendick is filled with sympathy almost awe as he watches
Moreaus lonely terrifying courage

CUT TO

EXT THE JETTY - DUSK
Waggdi comes loping up to Moreau and bows before him

WAGGDI
You must come at once Master The contractions
have started

MOREAU
Thank you Waggdi See that the entertainments
begin on time

Waggdi turns and lopes away happy on his errand Moreau turns away
from the setting sun and for a moment his mask slips the
weariness in his eyes showing through Then his face hardens and he
starts back towards the house

CUT TO
INT THE GUEST ROOM - DUSK

Aissa sits in front of the dressing table mirror She closely
examines her face She appears distressed as her finger touches a
small cluster of catlike whiskers that has begun to grow from her
cheek

She frowns and picks up a heavy tweezer In what is obviously
painful she plucks them out then daubs away a spot of blood with a
tissue

There comes a knock at the door and she turns with a start
The door opens a crack to admit Waggdis snout

WAGGDI
Youre on in five

AISSA
Thank you Waggdi

CUT TO
EXT THE COMPOUND - NIGHT

A performance of Alice is under way before a small crowd The
Sayer of the Law in his Moreau mask is shaking his rattle at
Azazello who crouches on his haunches before the small portable
screen from the Nissan hut

Aissa faces Azazello whose face is painted in a Cheshire Cats huge
grin Prendick looks on from the back of the crowd

AISSA
What sort of people live here
AZAZELLO
To the right lives a Hatter to the left a March
hare You can visit either if you like Theyre
both quite mad

AISSA
But I dont want to go among mad people

AZAZELLO
Cant be helped Were all mad here Im mad
Youre mad

There are some nervous giggles from the audience

AISSA
How do you know that Im mad

AZAZELLO
You must be or you wouldnt have come

Aissa looks to Prendick catching his eye for a moment He smiles
at her Azazello notices the interchange and smiles obscenely
within the exaggerated Cheshire smile His next line carries a
trace of menace

AZAZELLO
This place demands madness

CUT TO
INT THE LABORATORY - NIGHT

The convulsing body of the black leopard is strapped to the
operating table ringed by Moreau Montgomery Waggdi and another
of the Dog Men all of them clad now in surgical masks and gowns
Montgomery leans over the animal then glances up at Moreau sweat
beading his forehead

MONTGOMERY
Weve got to cut her Doc Weve got no choice

Moreau nods and looks to Waggdi

MOREAU
Caesarean Waggdi Scalpel

Waggdi hands him the blade and bending over the stricken animal
the doctor begins the operation

CUT TO
EXT THE VERANDAH — NIGHT
Prendick and Aissa standing at one end of the lon talking in hushed
voices as Prendick checks their bundles

AISSA
How was I

PRENDICK
Terrific You were the best Alice Ive ever
seen

AISSA

And how many Alices have you seen
He holds her by the shoulders

PRENDICK
Its time lets go

Aissa shoulders her bundle and follows him on tiptoe through the
study door

CUT TO
EXT THE COMPOUND - NIGHT

A screen is set up for a CD ROM projection system
Azazello punches a keyboard and shouts

AZAZELLO
Yaba daba doo

The animated Fred Flintsone appears on the screen and echoes the
shout which is then excitedly repeated by the gathering As Fred
reacts to something off screen Azazello pushes another key and --

A colorized clip from the film Blonde Venus A dancing gorilla on
the stage of a thirties nightclub

The audience GASPS in awe as the gorilla delicately removes its
head revealing itself to be Marlene Dietrich Then before their
widening eyes she strips off the rest of her gorilla suit and
launches into a song called Hot Voodoo The beast people watch
transfixed

Giggling with barely contained excitement Azazello punches wildly
at a keyboard and—

Godzilla appears To gasps and applause he begins destroying Tokyo

CUT TO
INT THE LABORATORY - NIGHT
The black leopard is close to death now a gaping wound in its
abdomen pinned open by surgical clamps as Moreau reaches inside it
to retrieve its premature offspring

WAGGDI
The incubator is ready Master

MOREAU
Alright Im going in

He turns his attention to the large throbbing life form that is
still coiled within its mothers dying shell Moreau reaches down
cutting into the membrane He has performed a hundred similar
operations but even he is unprepared for what comes next

There is a terrible wet tearing SOUND and something upwards from
the incision lunging towards Moreau A explodes malformed
squealing thing bifurcated far bigger than it should be its
skinless snout opening wide to reveal a double row of jagged teeth

CUT TO
EXT THE COMPOUND - NIGHT

Prendick and Aissa struggle with jerry cans of diesel to the
flatbed truck When they have humped the last of the cans Prendick
goes to the cab

Aissa stands watch beside the open door as Prendick puts his
beneath the dashboard of the flatbed There are sparks as he begins
hot wiring the truck

There is a low GROWL and the flatbed RUMBLES into life causing
Prendick to sit up too suddenly banging his head on the dashboard

PRENDICK
Lets go

Suddenly both of them freeze hearing the sounds of SCREAMS and
BREAKING GLASS coming from the laboratory Prendick turns towards
the Nissan hut in time to see one of the Dog Men appear in its
lighted doorway The figure is drenched in blood its eyes wide and
terrified It makes as if to step towards Prendick but then with a
ROAR something red and half glimpsed brings him down The Dog Man
SCREAMS hanging onto the doorframe for a moment Then with an
awful RENDING SOUND he loses his grasp and is dragged SCREAMING
back into the laboratory An instant later his screams are cut
short and low bloodcurdling SNARL ripples across the courtyard

PRENDICK
Get back
Aissa retreats into the safety of the big house and Prendick is
just starting back towards the flatbed when the hunched shape of
something not unlike a huge flayed cat appears in the laboratory
doorway walking on its hind legs and slowly pulling itself to its
full height its talons glistening with blood It stretches itself
and Prendicks mind reels as he sees that the creature seems to be
actually growing in bulk before his very eyes its muscles rippling
in the half light

He reaches for the door of the flatbed but the Chimaera sees him
now and launches itself at him with the speed of an express train
its nostrils flaring

He catches a fleeting glimpse of an awful face not human not
animal Prendick flings up one arm to defend himself but the
Chimaera flings him headlong wafer thin talons laying open his
chest and forearm

He rolls over and over his hands clasped over his head A volley
of shots is heard Then the beast is gone bounding towards the
main gate Prendick tries to sit up and then collapses again
Moreau comes running up a rifle in his hands his white face dewed
with blood

There is a loud CRASH of rending metal and the night is lit up for
a moment by an explosion of sparks from the electrified fence

Moreau stops in his tracks and Montgomery joins him breathless and
clutching an automatic in one hand

MOREAU
Its gone through the perimeter Waggdi Sound
the alarm

Moreau and Waggdi both make a dash for the big house while
Montgomery kneels beside Prendick examining the lacerations in his
chest and arm

MONTGOMERY
Jesus Christ Eddie that thing is loose Its
unbelievably strong

PRENDICK
(groaning)
Yeah tell me about it

MONTGOMERY
Let me see that Oh Jesus you gotta get
some disinfectant on these Aissa
Aissa who is cowering in the doorway of the big house snaps to
attention

MONTGOMERY
Get the first aid kit Fast

Aissa ducks back into the house and Prendick grimaces closing his
eyes

PRENDICK
Ah fuck I feel like Im on fire

MONTGOMERY
Just hold on buddy

Prendick grinds his teeth together as Aissa runs to him carrying
the First-Aid kit Montgomery swabs his wounds with antiseptic

AISSA
Hold still

Aissa presses her hands against Prendicks forehead

There is a CLATTER OF HOOVES and Moreau goes riding past on his
white horse hunting rifle slung over one shoulder a pack of
BARKING Dog Men brandishing cattle prods following at his heels He
sees Montgomery attending to Prendick

MOREAU
Never mind him Leave him

Montgomery starts up abandoning Prendick for a moment

MONTGOMERY
Wait Ill come Its too dangerous

Moreau glances back at him and there is something in his face
white as a deaths head in the moonlight that causes Montgomery to
fall silent

Moreau turns away the Dog Men spurring his horse towards the main
gate running at his heels in dismay Montgomery staring after him

CUT TO
INT THE GUEST ROOM - NIGHT

Montgomery and Aissa lower Prendick onto the bed
He is naked now sweat standing out on his forehead his chest and

arm swathed in bandages He tries to open his eyes wincing as if
blinded by the yellow flare of the paraffin lamp
PRENDICK
God why is that light so bright

Seeing the hypodermic Prendick starts to react as Montgomery slides
a needle into his forearm

MONTGOMERY
Easy Eddie youre in shock There

Prendick relaxes as Montgomery gets up and starts hastily towards
the door

Aissa touches his face soothing him as the drugs draw a chemical
curtain across his pain He sighs looking up at her haloed by the
hallucinatory glare of the lantern She smiles taking his hand and
placing it against her bosom

AISSA
Sleep Prendick My poor Five-Man I will make
you well Sleep

Aissa lies beside him forming herself cat-like against him
He slowly draws an arm over her

CUT TO
EXT THE ISLAND - DAWN

A seething volcanic sun rises above the rim of the earth SOUND OF
A HORN and the BAYING OF HOUNDS rising to greet it the from below
the canopy of the rainforest

CUT TO
EXT THE RAINFOREST - MORNING

A flock of parrots scatter in dismay as a line of Beast People come
CRASHING through a cane break beating the foliage to drive out
their quarry

Moreau follows at a distance on horseback Waggdi walking fast
beside him

Up ahead the undergrowth quivers and Waggdi freezes sniffing the
air

WAGGDI
He’s close Master I smell him Just a breath
away

Moreau reigns his steed to a halt cocking the hunting rifle
Waggdi steps forward towards the wall of greenery his cattle prod
raised defensively He reaches out to touch the crushed leaves and
when he draws back his fingers they are sticky with drying blood

He turns to Moreau nodding his head as if to signal him but at
that instant the wall of the rainforest erupts behind him

With an ear-splitting SHRIEK the Chimaera plunges from its hiding
place wrenching Waggdi from his feet

The horse rears in panic and Moreau is flung backwards from his
saddle He strikes a tree trunk landing awkwardly the breath
driven from him the hunting rifle still clenched in his hands

His horse bolts past him

Waggdi screams his cattle prod trying to fend off the Chimaeras
jaws with but the creature drags him down tightening its coils
remorselessly around him

Moreau regains his feet levelling the rifle as the Chimaera begins
to ingest the struggling Dog Man He catches a last glimpse of
Waggdis bulging eyes curiously calm now as if hypnotized by the
immensity of what is happening to him His body spasms and with a
HISS the Chimaera casts him aside turning its attention now
towards Moreau

Moreau meets its gaze and the creature hesitates fear sparking in
its eyes Then it raises its bifurcated snout and HOWLS

Moreau shivers his expression faltering as the full pain and
horror of what he has created comes home to him

MOREAU
(under his breath)
God Forgive me

There is a terrible pity in his eyes now
The rifle wavers in his hands

Then with a feral snarl the Chimaera launches itself at him He
pulls the trigger and the rifle jumps in his hands punching a hole
the size of a fist in the beasts torso The creature is upon him
before he can get off another round driving the rifle from his
hands its jaws closing on his body from side to side as it savages
him
Moreau goes limp and the creature drops him gathering itself to
full height bellowing in mindless rage Moreaus eyes flicker
open hazy with shock His good hand goes to his holster drawing
his pistol his eyes calm as he looks the Chimaera in the face
seeing the beasts glistening jaws widen before him

MOREAU
Thy will be done

The beast pounces and he raises his gun Plunging it into the
gaping maw he fires

The Chimaera shrieks rearing backwards its maimed head lashing
from side to side Then its rage spent it relinquishes its brief
tenure on life crumpling to the forest floor with a final hiss
pinning Moreau beneath the quivering carcass

The doctor groans dragging himself from beneath the fallen
creature and trying to stand but his legs give out and he falls to
his knees Looking up he sees a row of impossibly gaudy parrots
regarding him from a branch above He sighs as if overwhelmed by
the terrible fertility of the island

Gazing around he sees that a silent ring of Beast Folk have emerged
from the shadows and stand watching him In their dull animal gaze
is silent brooding contempt Cudgels and machetes are clutched in
their misshapen hands

Moreau recognizes Azazello the Boar Man and the Hyena-Swine
amongst the ranks and reaches out to them with a blood streaked
hand motioning them to come nearer

MOREAU
Help me

HYENA-SWINE
The master bleeds

AZAZELLO
If he bleeds he can die

HYENA-SWINE
He can die

MOREAU
Help me for the love of God

HYENA-SWINE
Do you love me father Do you love your son
The Hyena-Swine pads across the clearing towards Moreau its
hackles rising its tiny pig like eyes sparkling with bloodlust A
machete glints in its hand

MOREAU
I love you

HYENA-SWINE
Then let your son embrace you

Moreau bows his head

MOREAU
Children of the lawforgive me

HYENA-SWINE
Law no more

The machete swings in a gleaming arc and the good doctors body
falls to the waiting earth The Hyena-Swine raises the machete
seeing the masters blood glistening in the tropical sunshine

HYENA-SWINE
Now I am God

He licks Moreaus blood from the blade and begins giggling
hysterically while his comrades abandoning their fear close in and
beat the doctors fallen body Taking up the Hyena-Swines chant
they release years of rage in animal savagery

ALL
Law no more Law no more

The parrots shift nervously on their perches taking flight one by
one as the beast folk dance in bizarre celebration around Moreaus
body The birds rise up through the leafy canopy of the trees to
the sky and the heavens beyond

Afterwards something like snowflakes falls and melts in the
Pacific sun and the distant thunder of an approaching storm rumbles

over the scene

CUT TO
INT THE GUEST ROOM — DAY

THUNDER crashes outside and warm rain squalls against the glass
Aissa turns over kissing Prendick on the forehead

He opens his eyes and she smiles at him
He looks at her and his eyes widen

Some strange reversion has begun The imperfect upper-lip has
become exaggerated and a distinct fur-like down appeared has on
her face but she is nonetheless still beautiful

Prendick stares She draws him close and he kisses her again His
face is guided by her hands down to her breasts His lips find her
nipples and she twists with arousal then she guides his face
further down her body to another set of breasts vestigial buds
that have erupted on the smooth skin of her torso

Prendick reacts balancing on a knife edge of revulsion and desire
then he gives in to the latter kissing wildly at her feral
mammaries aroused beyond any point of return

Again louder there comes the sound of THUNDER

CUT TO
EXT THE RAINFOREST - DAY

The THUNDER becomes the sound of hooves and we see the riderless
white stallion racing through the trees its flanks wet with foam

CUT TO
EXT THE COMPOUND - DAY

A violent storm lashes the island A WAILING procession of Beast
Folk led by the Sayer of the Law trudge slowly through the
driving rain their heads bowed as they bear Moreau back to the big
house his body held aloft his arms outstretched as if crucified
his head tilted back rain falling in his sightless eyes and
washing the blood from his face in pink rivulets

Montgomery stands waiting for them on the front lawn his features
twisted in despair

Behind him Prendick comes slowly down the driveway supported by
Aissa He is barefoot dressed only in a blanket and a damp pair of
flannel trousers

MONTGOMERY
Its all over Oh god

The procession comes to a halt and the Sayer of the Law steps
forward to address Montgomery

SAYER OF THE LAW
He is dead
AZAZELLO
Is there a Law now Is it still to be this and
that

SAYER OF THE LAW
Is there a Law thou Other with the whip Is
there a Law now that He is dead

Montgomery looks to Prendick his jaw hanging slackly

Prendick steps forward Aissa clinging to his arm and tries to
take command of the situation

PRENDICK
Of course theres a Law

HYENA-SWINE
Law no more

PRENDICK
Theres a law Listen to me He isnt dead

The Beast People turn their sharp eyes upon him

PRENDICK
Hes here Now He isnt dead Hes left his
body but hes here You cant see him but
Right there

Prendick points towards the leaden sky Montgomery looks at him
with amazed admiration

MONTGOMERY
Good buddy Thats good Jesus thats qreat

PRENDICK
You cant see him but he can see you Hes

watching you right now

KIRIL
Fear the Law

There is a flicker of lightning and the Beast People look nervously
to the sky

Assassimon stares in terrible suspicion and uncertainty

KIRIL
He is great He is good
PRENDICK
Come with me We must bring his old body up to
the big house Then hell tell us what to do

He motions for them to follow setting off at the head of the
procession Reluctantly Assassimon joins them

CUT TO
EXT THE COURTYARD - DUSK

The rain has stopped now but the sky is still dark and threatening
The remaining Dog Men under the command of MLing are busy making
a pyre of brushwood and broken furniture Moreaus body dressed in
a pristine white suit and garlanded with flowers is laid out ona
pallet at the top of the pyre

Aissa kneels beside him now and places his Panama hat on his chest
Prendick watches her closely almost desperately for a sign of
human grief

Tears start down Aissas cheeks Prendick looks on moved

CUT TO
INT MONTGOMERYS QUARTERS - DUSK

Montgomery sits hunched over the paraffin lantern swigging froma
bottle of vodka and downing pills by the handful his gun on the
tabletop beside him

Prendick sits opposite him his eyes wandering over the disarray
that surrounds them the tattered posters and pathetic remnants of
the counter-culture and Montgomerys past life From outside rises
the SOUND OF DRUMS and bestial VOICES howling and keening in
lamentation

PRENDICK
Were going to have to go out there -- and light

ripe and they smell it its all over

MONTGOMERY

pockets with pills

missionary save her him why dont you just

Prendick rises facing him and Montgomery snatches up the
automatic waving it at his head

MONTGOMERY
Hey man youre standing between me and the
party lights Get out of my way

PRENDICK
Sure Go ahead Go ahead

Montgomery flings the door open his eyes blots of deep
black in the yellow light the gun trembling in his hand
MONTGOMERY
You know man youve got no view With you its
all survival Were right on the edge here and
I aint gonna miss it may be dead tomorrow but

He turns and goes out into the moonlight
MLing who is waiting outside rises to meet him
MONTGOMERY

MLing MLing my man Bring the flatbed around
at once Its party time

Prendick follows him to the doorway looking out into the night

CUT TO
EXT THE BEACH — NIGHT

The crowd parts as Montgomery walks amongst them dispensing
pills

MONTGOMERY
Free drugs Come on Who wants to get high
Lets see some hands

A forest of misshapen appendages rises around him and he fills
hand indiscriminately with whatever he pulls from his pockets

MONTGOMERY
There you go a little Uptown for you some
Downtown for you Cat food for the dogs and

He addresses the assembly of Chimaera

MONTGOMERY
Its the dawning of a whole new deal boys and
girls Im the Man now and were gonna have fun

The Beast People press tight around him pawing at him helping
themselves now to the contents of his pockets

CUT TO
EXT THE COURTYARD — NIGHT

each
Prendick Aissa and the remaining Beast People still loyal to
Moreau stand ringed around the pyre For a moment theyre
motionless their heads bowed in a prayer then Prendick tosses

a

lighted torch into the brushwood at the base of the mound and the

flames begin to climb hungrily around Moreaus body The
congregation remains silent watching until More aus body
is lost in flame and smoke

Prendick turns to Aissa now seeing her eyes glinting like an
animals in the firelight

AISSA
Will we go now

PRENDICK
Yes

They look at each other a terrible awareness in Aissas face

AISSA
I know Prendick I know what is happening to
me I can feel it

PRENDICK

It doesnt matter

AISSA
Yes it matters

PRENDICK
Theres a way to fix it in your fathers notes
Ill find it Well bring you back Now go to
the house Get whatever you need to take

AISSA
(apprehensive)

Where are you going

PRENDICK
Theres something I have to do

He turns to address the assembly
PRENDICK
Children of the Law Listen to me The Master

has left a task for you

He turns towards the laboratory motioning for the Beast People
follow him

INT THE LABORATORY - NIGHT

Prendick strides down the aisleway between the cages Kiril and the
Sayer of the Law leading the remnants of the Beast People behind
him

PRENDICK
Empty the cages Free all of them

The Beast Folk go to work at once scooping rabbits from their
hutches dogs and cats and monkeys from their cages Prendick
stalks slowly through the devastated laboratory flipping the
switch on a Nagra as he passes hearing Moreaus VOICE nothing
more now than a magnetic ghost

MOREAUS VOICE
Systolic pressure 32 Diastolic pressure up to 4
Pulmonary pressure stands at 58

Prendick stops at the shelf lifting Moreaus black book

It falls open in his hands and he casts an eye over the chemical
equations contained there an escaped monkey scampering up to him
to perch on his shoulder mimicking his puzzlement at Moreaus
notes

Behind him the Sayer of the Law opens the incubators one by one
handing out the mewling mutant infants to a line of island women
who bear them out into the safety of the orange night

CUT TO
EXT THE BEACH - NIGHT

The awesome SOUND of the Jimi Hendrix Experience throbbing from a
tinny set of speakers supplemented by a line of DRUMMING Beast
Folk tangling with the SOUNDTRACK of King Kong that is climbing
on a screen set before the CD-ROM projector that has been set up
for a rapt tripped-out animal audience A great bonfire is raining
sparks into the sky farther up the beach ringed by furiously
dancing creatures Beside the bonfire an axe-wielding Dog Man is
chopping up the remains of the beached motor launch and feeding
them into the flames

Montgomery stands near the fire burning of the boat supervising
the ritual a garland of flowers around his neck and a joint
dangling from his lower lip

The Sloth Creature drags at the hem of his coat and he
smiles sadly turning out his pockets
MONTGOMERY
All gone See All tapped out Were in the same
boat now
(points to the burning launch)
and there it is right there Up the creek
without a paddle Any of you ever hear that
expression

He starts to get undressed throwing his clothes to the Beast
People who grab at them eagerly fighting for possession of the
more treasured articles

Montgomery lifts his head up and shouts

MONTGOMERY
How do you like this Moreau Isnt this some
wild shit

The Beast People press tighter around him reaching out to touch
his pale skin He giggles looking up at the stars

MONTGOMERY
All flesh is grass boys and girls You blink
and its all gone

He grabs an already disheveled Beast Woman and breaks into a
demented frenzied and very dirty boogie

The flatbed goes rumbling past headlights blazing circling
dangerously close to the fire joyriding through the night going
nowhere MLing at the wheel

CUT TO
INT THE STUDY — NIGHT

Azazello unbolts the gun locker and opens it up to display its
contents to his fellow conspirators the Hyena-Swine a bristly
black Boar Man and a pair of the surviving Dog Men who still wear
waiters coats Behind them the rest of the room is already in
chaos as several of the Beast People root through Moreaus papers
flinging the books from the shelves the unleashed parrot flapping
wildly around their heads The Hyena-Swine hefts a Kalashnikov his
eyes glowing in anticipation

HYENA-SWINE
Now we have the fire that kills Now we are
Gods

Azazello weighs a hand grenade in his palm his face cracking in a
terrible gap-toothed grin
CUT TO
INT THE HALL — NIGHT

Aissa crosses the hallway on her way to her room

There is a sudden rattle of automatic GUNFIRE followed by a sudden
peal of raucous LAUGHTER from the direction of the study and she
stiffens drawing back against the wall with a HISS

Azazello appears now in the study door clutching a bottle of
brandy the other two Dog Men following him at a pace

AZAZELLO
Trip-trap trip-trap and where are you going
in the woods today little girl

Aissa edges towards the door but the Dog Men cut her off

AZAZELLO
Looking for your five-finger man He cant help
you There are no masters anymore

He advances and she raises a hand as if to strike him Her claws
extend from her fingertips and her eyes glint in the firelight The
hair on her back raises as she emits a long catlike hiss

AZAZELLO
Nicely now little kitten-Aissa or Ill hurt you
Remember how the master hurt me Oh how he
whipped me

He gives an oily CHUCKLE his voice becoming a growl

AZAZELLO
But he spared your soft skin

One of the Dog Men reaches out to grab her hair and she bares her
teeth in a feral snarl Lashing out at Azazello her claws rake his
face nearly blinding him

Azazello stumbles back with a canine yelp pawing at his snout The
other two Dog Men lunge at her the blood lust rising in their
eyes

Aissa turns Finding no way out of the room she leaps toward the
curtains Locking her claws in the heavy material she scrambles up
toward the valence while the Dog Men try to grab her and pull her
back
She tries to reach the large chandelier but the curtains
and valence give way and she falls back toward the floor
in mid- fall she twists catlike to land on all fours ina
crouch

A low threatening growl boils from her throat as she faces Azazello
and the Dog Men holding them at bay like a cornered cat as they
maneuver cautiously to surround her

Suddenly with a shriek she springs at Azazello Her claws tear
with lightening speed at his face while he staggers back His hand
goes into his coat and he pulls an automatic

As Aissa claws for his throat he shoots her at zero range There
is a deafening concussion Her eyes widen revealing the green fire
of her rage as she convulses with the impact

CUT TO
EXT THE COURTYARD — NIGHT

The remainder of the Beast People standing before the blazing
pyre turn as a burst of gunfire shatters the night

The Hyena-Swine stands in the doorway of the big house brandishing
his Kalashnikov As the congregation watches he fires a second
burst at the stars

HYENA-SWINE
Bow to me I send the fire that kills

He squeezes off another burst for effect and several of the Beast
People drop to their knees Kiril moves forward pulling the
groveling figures back to their feet by the scruffs of their necks

HYENA-SWINE
Bow to me

KIRIL
Who are you that I should bow to you We are
brothers

He turns to face the congregation

KIRIL
Children of the Law we must stand firm We must
uphold the Law and work together now We must
rule with love not hate We are brothers all
of us

The Hyena-Swine switches the Kalashnikov onto single fire and
shoots Kiril in the back He pitches forward
The congregation GASPS
The Hyena-Swine CHUCKLES slides in a new banana clip

Some of the Beast People start to shout now falling to
their knees and wringing their hands

SAYER OF THE LAW
No This is wrong You are breaking the Law

HYENA-SWINE
If It Feels Good Do It is the Law Montgomery
told me so

SAYER OF THE LAW
We must have Laws We are not animals

HYENA-SWINE
Law no more

SAYER OF THE LAW
(with incredible feeling)
Are we not men

The Hyena-Swine laughs switches his Kalashnikov onto full auto and
empties its magazine into the crowd the Boar Man at his side
excitedly joining in the massacre with his own AK-47 All those who
are still standing are caught in a withering rain of bullets their
bodies jerking in the glow of the funeral pyre

The Sayer of the Law is among the first to fall his mask shattered
by a bullet between the eyes

A spray of bullets punch into fuel cans stockpiled in the yard a
rivulet of gasoline creeps away leading back towards the big
house

The Hyena-Swine is laughing and laughing the gun growing hot in
his hands fire leaping in his eyes

CUT TO
INT THE LAB - NIGHT

Prendick takes a crowbar to a metal file and rips it open He tears
through the papers and finds several note books He begins

frantically flipping through them

CUT TO
EXT THE BEACH - NIGHT

Things have started to slip at the beach party
Several of the Beast Folk lie shaking on the sand

gripped by

epileptic seizures while one of the Cat People has torn out its
own eyes and sits screaming beside the projector The flatbed is

stuck in the sand smoke pouring out of it MLing
towards the fire in open embarrassment

limping back

Montgomery stands naked in the midst of the admiring Chimaeras
staring back towards the big house his attention drawn by the

sound of GUNFIRE

MONTGOMERY
What the fuck now

MLING
Master

MLing steps towards Montgomery but the Bison Man cuts him off
striking the Dog Man over the head with an empty bottle

MONTGOMERY
No Dont hurt him

He makes as if to go to MLings assistance but the Bison Man

blocks his way

BISON MAN
No more Masters

Montgomery turns to see the other Beast Folk crowding in on him an
awful hunger flaring in their eyes A low growl ripples across the

beach rising into a snarl of rage

MONTGOMERY
Hey I come on man lighten up This is
supposed to be a party

The little pink Sloth thing steps suddenly forward
Montgomery in the chest with his own automatic

He staggers backwards staring in disbelief at the
his breastbone

MONTGOMERY
Shit You You were always such a sweet
fucker too Jesus Thanks a lot

and shoots

puckered hole in

little

He falls against the CD-ROM projector and the image goes into gross

distortion

He slips to his knees and with a SHRIEK the Beast People fall

upon him ripping and ravaging
CUT TO
INT THE LABORATORY - NIGHT

Prendick is edging towards the door Moreaus black book clutched to
his chest his automatic in his hand when the Hyena-Swine and the
Boar Man burst into the room levelling their rifles He dives for
the cover of the overturned operating table a bullet meant for his
heart hitting instead in the leather cover of Moreaus journal

He hugs the ground covering his head as the renegades pump round
after round into the laboratory shattering the overhead lights and
laboratory equipment

The big tank cracks and comes apart spilling a wave of warm
amniotic fluid across the floor the gilled mutations flopping and
writhing amidst the broken glass

The Hyena-Swine pauses to reload padding on the tips of its toes
towards Prendicks hiding place its teeth bared

HYENA-SWINE
Come out and face me Let us see who is the
Master now

Prendick crawls gasping for the safety of the ruined bank of audio-
visual equipment prompting a hysterical burst of GUNFIRE from the
Hyena-Swine

Prendick cringes bullets RICOCHETING and sparking all around him

There follows another lull as the Hyena-Swine fumbles for a fresh
clip Prendick uses the breathing space to reach for the Nagra The
Boar Man turns levelling his rifle but at that moment Moreaus
icy voice fills the room

MOREAUS VOICE
Diastolic pressure up to 4 Pulmonary pressure
stands at 58 Heartbeat irregular

The Boar Man freezes turning to the Hyena-Swine

HYENA-SWINE
No It is a trick He is dead We killed him

He opens fire once more but Prendick has already ducked safely out
of sight crouching behind a console and pulling on a pair of
goggles
The Hyena-Swine glances about himself uneasily then as he steps
forward Prendick reaches out and throws the switch on the laser
its light filling the room with a brilliant blue-green glare The
renegades yell trying to cover their eyes as Prendick springs
from behind the console shooting the Boar Man in the throat The
Boar Man topples backwards

The Hyena-Swine screams blindly loosing a burst of gunfire in
Prendicks direction One of the bullets damages the lasers
housing and Prendick decides to take a chance diving across the
room towards the door and tilting the laser from its bearings as he
passes

The laser cuts the Hyena-Swine across the face and he tumbles
backwards with a shriek clutching at his face

Then Prendick shoots him in the stomach and he goes down falling
amidst the tendrils of the tank dwellers still kicking and
screaming one paw grasping for a hand grenade

Prendick takes a step back as the Hyena-Swine pulls the pin and
draws back his arm to pitch the grenade but then one of the
tentacles coils around his wrist and holds it tight Prendick leaps
for the door

The Hyena-Swines last shriek of pain and fear is cut short by an
ear-splitting CONCUSSION and the laboratory is torn apart in a ball
of fire and flying shrapnel

CUT TO
EXT THE COURTYARD — NIGHT

Prendick steps over the mound of corpses eyes narrowed against the
smoke the gun in one hand Moreaus black book in the other

PRENDICK
Aissa

He scans the faces of the dead but does not see her among them
The flames are spreading now from the blazing laboratory to the
other huts climbing towards the radio mast Up ahead the big
house is already on fire and Prendick battles his way towards its
door

CUT TO
INT THE HALL — NIGHT

Prendick stumbles coughing through the doorway one arm raised to
protect his face from its burning frame
PRENDICK
Aissa

Then his eyes to adjust to the smoke-filled room and what he sees
seems to rob him of what little sanity he has left

Aissas body lies on the dining table her entire torso an open
wound Azazello and the Dog Men sitting around her as if about to
feed on her flesh

Prendick reacts with a bellow of primal rage He raises his gun and
blasts at the Dog Men One is struck in the head Another is shot
when he runs for the door Wounded he runs yelping to a corner
where other shots bring him down

Prendick turns the gun on Azazello who glares at him with canine
menace He pulls the trigger but the chamber CLICKS on empty

Azazello turns with a SHRIEK and throws himself through the
rear window fleeing YELPING into the night

Prendick stands over Aissa beyond grief beyond any emotion
Taking the compass from her fingers he holds her hand as the
flames move across the walls around him

CUT TO
EXT THE COMPOUND — NIGHT

A series of EXPLOSIONS rip through the enclosure engulfing the big
house the singing aloes rising screaming in tongues of living
flame

CUT TO
EXT THE BEACH — DAWN

Prendick stands watching the rising sun He seems transformed by
grief and by his exposure to horror The big house is burning
behind him Montgomerys remains are at his feet covered in a
blood-soaked blanket MLing kneels beside him weeping

MLING
They are mad They are fools They say there is
no Law No Master No whips No House of Pain
anymore We love the Law and will keep it now
but there is no more pain no more whips forever
again they say But I know Master I know You
still live You have walked in the sea and
lived

Prendick pats MLings head
PRENDICK
Youre a good man MLing

MLING
You will kill them all

Prendick turns his eyes towards the burning flatbed and the
remnants of the motor launch There are bodies strewn all over the
beach

PRENDICK
No Not all

MLING
The Masters will is sweet

Behind them the radio mast collapses sending a flurry of sparks
climbing into the heavens

CUT TO
EXT THE COMPOUND — DAY

The SOUND of the HORN rises once more into the morning air
Prendick MLing Assassimon and two of the remaining elders stand
on the rostrum Azazello bound and kneeling at their feet

The rest of the islanders gather uneasily before them There are
fewer than thirty of them left

PRENDICK
He’s not dead Hes speaking to me right now
The House of Pain will be back again You cant
see the Master but hes watching everything you
do

MLING
True True

The Fox Lady steps forward cradling one of the children from the
incubators

FOX LADY
The Man Who Walks in the Sea now leads

PRENDICK
The Master speaks through me For those who
break the Law

ASSASSIMON
Back to the House of Pain Back to the House of
Pain
The congregation takes up the chant their voices swelling
Prendick stares in cold fury as Azazello slinks forward contrite
and very frightened He kneels before Prendick who touches his
head with barely-controlled hatred

ALL (CHORUS)
Back to the House of Pain Back to the House of
Pain

AZAZELLO
(looking imploringly at Prendick)
Back to the House of Pain Back to the House of
Pain

He tries to lick Prendicks hand Prendick puts the gun to
Azazellos head and the Dog Man whimpers

The gun jumps spitting fire and Azazello falls blood jetting
from his temple The audience falls silent

FOX LADY
The gun has spoken It is good

They fall into a new rhythm their chant rising and rising

ALL (CHORUS)
His is the hand that wounds His is the hand
that heals His is the lightning flash His is
the deep salt sea

Prendick stands looking out over them Moreaus book still clutched
under his arm the gun clenched in his free hand Its as though
hes staring at something a thousand miles away as tears start
down his cheeks

The crowd bows down the sky filled with black smoke rising from
the ruins behind them the emblem of the Tree of Life still
fluttering from the flagpole above

DISSOLVE TO
INT THE CAVE - DAY

Prendick stands in the shaft of light at the center of the cavern
the fetish staff in his hands leading the chanting congregation
His hair and beard have grown long and wild now his and his
clothes are embroidered with bones and tassels face bedaubed with
paint
PRENDICK (VO)
After that day I became the Sayer of the Law
Every day for nine months I stood in front of
the Tree of Life and talked to them

DISSOLVE TO
INT THE CAVE — NIGHT

Prendick is observing the moon through a cleft in the rock and
marking the lunar calendar painted on the cavern wall

PRENDICK (VO)
I rewrote the Law and tried to teach them new
ways to survive on their own The Law I gave
them was the Law I dreamed of as a boy that had
made me want to be a lawyer a Law that never
really existed anywhere in the real world
except here

DISSOLVE TO
EXT THE ISLAND — DAY

Prendick stands thigh deep in the river teaching MLing and the
others the finer points of spear fishing a lesson interrupted when
two of the onlookers start to squabble over a particularly juicy-
looking barbel

PRENDICK (VO)
I taught them all I could but day by day the
animal returned to take over that which was
human Like it always has and always will Like
Moreau said it would

DISSOLVE TO
EXT THE SETTLEMENT — DAY

Prendick MLing and several others huddle beneath a fan of woven
palm leaves sheltering from a torrential downpour

PRENDICK (VO)
About thirty of them had survived and eight of
those were dead by the end of the hurricane
season most from untreatable illnesses caused
by their genetic disorders I knew that if Aissa
had lived she would have shared their fate but
that didnt take the pain away By the time the
trade winds blew again from the west only
MLing and Assassimon still clung to the power
of speech and were able to help me in my work

DISSOLVE TO
EXT THE BEACH — DAY

Moreaus horse has been employed in dragging logs down from the
rainforest to where MLing and Prendick are shaping them with
makeshift axes

Assassimon sits nearby emptying barrels of diesel into the sand

There follows a MONTAGE of activity as the raft slowly takes shape
Assassimon rigging its sails as it lies at berth next to the jetty
while Prendick and MLing load it with supplies

PRENDICK
Ill be back with help Give me three months

MLING
It is good Go well Master

PRENDICK
Go well yourself MLing Good MLing

He embraces MLing The Dog Man fawns upon him whimpering Then he
pulls away and clambering aboard the raft makes ready and casts
off

Assassimon comes running down the jetty shouting at the top of his
lungs

ASSASSIMON
He is going He is good He is going He is
great

Prendick strikes an offshore current unfurling a bright sheet of
homespun from the mast a gaudy representation of The Tree Of Life
painted in its center The wind fills the sail and he adjusts the
tillers turning the rafts prow towards the open sea

MLing sits down his big feet dangling over the edge of the jetty
looking a little dejected watching until Prendick is far away

MLING
We must read We must keep speech for his
return

Then he lifts a battered copy of Alice in Wonderland and begins to
read aloud once more while Assassimon hopping from foot to foot
pretends to mouth the words over his shoulder
MLING
(reads haltingly)

Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall
Humpty Dumpty had a great fall
All the Kings horses and all
the Kings men
Couldnt put Humpty Dumpty
together again

MLings voice falters tapering off into a bestial whimper

He sits for a long while in silence the book sagging in his hands
watching the sail of Prendicks raft until it has disappeared from
sight

DISSOLVE TO
THE DISC OF THE SUN

A dazzling overexposed white
DISSOLVE THROUGH WHITE TO
EXT THE PACIFIC OCEAN - DAY (TWO DAYS LATER)

Prendick lies on his back on the raft the sail flapping slackly

now his face raw and blistered from the sun His head sways with
the rise and fall of the ocean and all the horizon seems to sway

with him the earth and sky and the shining crack that separates

them

A dark smudge appears on the horizon Dancing Drawing nearer He
closes his eyes

When he opens his eyes again he sees the side of a freighter
looming over him a row of figures gathered at the rail outlines
silhouetted against the sun

Hands lift him now Twisted misshapen hands tipped with curious
nails

His eyes focus on his rescuers and he sees the intent faces of
beasts of prey glaring down at him their faces snoutish and
porcine back covered with a sickly pink skin their lips curling
from yellowed teeth

He looks at them completely blank

CUT TO
INT THE SANATORIUM - DAY (THREE YEARS LATER)
Prendick blinks opening his eyes to find that he is still sitting
on his chair in Dr Murnaus office the beasts have become the
CHIEF DOCTOR and two of the staff psychiatrists DR WIENE and DR
MOCH sitting facing him He is clean shaven now and is wearing a
brand new suit and tie

MURNAU
Im glad were in agreement You finally
understand youve been suffering an acute form
of post-traumatic stress disorder brought on by
the plane crash and your terrible ordeal at
sea You should be able to gradually unlock
the memory of what really happened to you during
that lost year

PRENDICK
I have I see that nothing much happened at all
I was simply adrift

DR MOCH
Perhaps as a young man you read about the real
Doctor Moreau who won Nobel Prize in 1989 The
controversy surrounding his work could have been
incorporated into your fantasies

Prendick smiles nods

PRENDICK
So I guess now its on with my life

MURNAU
Youve come a very long way

PRENDICK
Thank you Gentlemen Thank you all for
everything

He stands folding his coat over his arm When he looks back at the
doctors however it is to find them transformed into scabrous
carrion birds staring hungrily at him across the desktop with their
vulpine bespectacled eyes their dark wings stirring
threateningly He maintains his smile

CUT TO
EXT THE STREET - DAY

Prendick stands on the corner of a busy city street his coat still
folded over his arm staring at the hubbub of life that surrounds
him
PRENDICK (VO)
I was released from the hospital in October
2010 The world hadnt come to an end although
there had been a nuclear exchange Everything
else it seems had been a symptom of my
psychosis

We see the crowded street now through Prendicks eyes

Weary DEER MEN and CATTLE PEOPLE shambling past him with wounded
eyes dripping blood OLD PEOPLE bent and dull murmuring to
themselves prowling WOMEN mewing after him and dancing packs of
jibing MONKEY CHILDREN skipping through a gridlocked traffic jam of
barking CANINE MOTORISTS belligerent PORCINE TRAFFIC POLICE trying
to maintain order Prendick turns now seeing his own reflection in
a shop window the reflection of a rather melancholy-looking
sheepdog lost that has its flock its eyes tired and lonely

CUT TO
INT THE COTTAGE - DUSK

The fire is low on the hearth Prendick sits hunched in the semi-
darkness the loaded gun still cradled in his hands finishing up
his final message running through the Nagra a dog barking in the
distance

Moreaus notebook lies open on the table before him a reproduction
of Drapers Lament for Icarus tacked on the wall behind him All
over the desk on crumpled pieces of paper are sketches of the
Tree of Life

PRENDICK(VO)
On the island I had thought that Moreau was the
loneliest man on the earth But that was before
I became what Ive become Ive spent my time
in reading and studying biochemistry only to
realize that what Moreau did was in fact
possible What happened cant be dismissed as a
nightmare So Ive had no choice but to live
alone with the horrible truth

Prendick raises the gun closing his eyes
PRENDICK (VO)
(haltingly)
Now I find there is simply no way to bear the

loneliness

In the near background we hear the barking of a dog
Prendick squeezes his eyelids shut trying to blot out the noise

He draws the hammer back with an audible click Suddenly there is
the sound of a pair of paws hitting the pane of glass in a French

door The barking is now very loud almost in the room

Prendick opens his eyes once more The barking goes on It has a
strange pleading quality

Prendick lowers the gun and looks toward the door

The dog is looking in It sees him and barks with sudden
recognition Prendick cant avoid the animal He rises and the dog
paws wildly at the doorpanel with obvious joy at his approach
Prendick tries to muster a stern look

PRENDICK
I locked you out for a reason I cant very well
kill myself with you pestering me

The dog barks imploring then looks at Prendick and cocks his head
He whympers for Prendicks affection

PRENDICK
What Youd miss me

The dog responds with a short decisive bark

Prendick steps to the door and opens it The dog rushes away with
wild joyous excitement

It begins a wild frolic on the hillside before the cottage The
downright silliness of the animals joyful exuberant forces a trace
of reluctant smile to Prendicks lips

CUT TO
EXT SOMEWHERE IN NEW ENGLAND - DUSK

A curtain of rain falls across the downland turned to motes of
gold by the dying light descending as a blessing upon the soft
green hills and patchwork farmsteads

The dog comes running along the crest of a hill rejoicing barking
at the rain eyes brimming with a simple animal happiness It skids
to a halt shaking itself turning its snout towards the dying
light The rain has stopped the sky is clearing

Its master walks now to stand beside it his hands in his pockets
contemplating the same awesome view Then Prendick bends down to
pat the dog as it leaps up putting its paws against his chest to
lick his face that is wet with rain or tears
Prendick looks deep into the sweet liquid eyes of the dog

FADE TO BLACK
