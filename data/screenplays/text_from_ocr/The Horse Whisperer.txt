Pilgrim bursts through the stall and runs out the stables
into a blinding white morning

EXT AN OPEN FIELD LEADING TO WOODS - BRIGHT MORNING
Whiteness Snow and sky without any discernible line between

Camera is POV as if on the horse riding through the
whiteness Snow kicks up from the side We hear the breathing
of the horse As we travel on hills through trees we
experience of sense of wild exhilarating freedom

We hear the giggles of a GIRL (GRACE) on the horse An
occasional line

GRACE (0S)

eager to get out

several newspapers that were delivered She carries them into
the kitchen and sets them beside a huge stack of publications
magazines papers etc Knowing she must read all of them at
some point she breathes a disgusted sign She thumbs through
the POST as she pours herself a cup of coffee Something
catches her eyes and she snarls

ANNIE
That little shit

She dials a portable phone and moves through the apartment as
she talks

ANNIE
Hi Lucy Did I wake you Have

little item about me and Fiske Hes

Throughout the phone call Annie is selecting clothes
turning on the shower undressing

EXT DYER HORSE FARM - MORNING

The snow has stopped falling Grace walks along a hill hands
in pocket Spread out on the landscape are horses on a horse
farm standing like statues in the white covered fields

As Grace comes along the hill we see another GIRL (JUDITH)
coming from the opposite direction She doesnt have Graces
lean elegance but her warm friendly smile brightens her
face Upon reaching her Grace returns the smile with a hug

JUDITH
Its warmer than I thought

GRACE
You want to go to a movie tonight

JUDITH
I thought your moms coming up

GRACE
(prickly)
So

Judith immediately senses a problem so she continues casually
as they begin walking away from Camera

JUDITH
My parents are having friends from
college over Theyre really nice
They have this gorgeous son who wants
to be a forest ranger

GRACE
Can I come Ill start a fire

Judith laughs as they continue talking their voices trailing
off as the girls head for the stables

There are several horses in their stalls Grace and Judith
enter talking carrying their English saddles Judith stops
at a stall disappearing into it as she says Hello
Grace continues to the end stall

her back

INT ANNIES MAGAZINE OFFICE - MID-MORNING

Annie casually dressed enters the empty offices of her
magazine She turns on the light revealing a large row of
stalls and glassed in private offices Everywhere we look we
see indications of the kind of magazine she edits

She strolls to her office -- the largest -- surrounded by
windows The office walls are covered with photos most of
which are COVER STORIES ON ANNIE

(One photo is of Annies father MARTIN A BRITISH AMBASSADOR
with his young daughter on his lap her arms affectionately
around his neck Her mother stands right behind them posing
like a member of the royal family)

Annie sits and takes a breath The only photo on her desk is
a family portrait taken when Annie was given the Crystal
Award -- Robert Grace herself and the Award She checks her
watch -- it is almost 930

INT MACLEAN FARMHOUSE MASTER BEDROOMCLOSET - MID-MORNING

A WALK-IN CLOSET of the master bedroom one side is Annies

beside his cologne assortment A FRAMED PHOTO OF HE AND ANNIE

energy boosts

EXT CONNECTICUT COUNTRYSIDE - MORNING

Long Shot of the girls riding at an easy pacing talking all
the time Grace is an elegant rider quite self-assured for a
13-year-old We come into the scene at the moment the

girls have just shared a secret or a fantasy Judith is
giggling uncontrollably Grace laughs as she says

GRACE
Oh come on You think the same thing

JUDITH
I just could never say it

They stop at the end of the field facing the woods

GRACE
Do you want to go around by the
old road

JUDITH
Why dont we just cut through the
woods

Grace nods They ride into the woods continuing their talk
EXT WOODS - MORNING

The girls ride down along a stand of hickories and poplars
to a RIVER They stop the horses and their conversation to
listen to the sound of the water Below them off in the
distance they can just make out a two-lane country road

GRACE
You want to go down or stay along
the river

JUDITH
We already did the river Lets go down
and across the old bridge We can circle
back

They begin to make their way

INT ANNIES OFFICE - MORNING

Annies office is now crowded with a dozen or so employees
sitting on the couch on the window sills on the arms of
chairs against the walls Paper bag emptied of bagels

cream cheese orange juice paper plates

Hand Held Camera captures the energy of the room as it

follows overlapping lines laughter etc yet no matter how
casual it all seems Annie is very much at the center of
control We enter the scene of LAUGHTER as Annie asks

KEVIN a feature writer

ANNIE
So what did you say to her

KEVIN

(LAUGHTER AD LIBS)

ANNIE
David he signed an agreement that he
wouldnt talk to the press and hes
libeled me by saying I faked the figures
Youre not going soft on me are you

Silence Gottschalk doesnt immediately respond Everyone
waits Covert looks between characters suggest this is
interesting -- has Annie over-stepped her bounds with the
magazines owner Annie waits without a shred of anxiety --
even though she might have some Finally

DAVID GOTTSCHALK (VO)
Well I suppose we could use another
good public feud

ANNIE
Exactly

Everyone silently acknowledges Annie guts and influence
EXT COUNTRYSIDE - MORNING

Its perfectly still We are looking down an empty TWO-LANE
ROAD covered with fresh snow We see the girls slowly riding
out of the woods talking They cross the road and start up
into the woods on the other side They are trying to sing a
LIZ PHAIR song CHOPSTICKS

GRACE JUDITH
(singing)
I met him at a party and he told me how
he like to drive me home He said he

liked to do it backwards

GRACE
(singing)
J I said it--

JUDITH
(singing)
and I said that

GRACE
(stops singing)
No wait it just goes he said he

liked to do-

Suddenly theres the SOUND OF THE METAL OF JUDITHS HORSE
scraping on some sheer ice hidden under the soft snow Judith
notices first

JUDITH
What was --
The horse staggers Judith looks to Grace --

JUDITH
Grace

The horse tries to find tracing with his hindfeet kicking
up sprays of snow and ice shards The horse suddenly falls on
the ice and goes down hard on its knees

GRACE
JUDITH

The horse stumbles to get back on its feet slipping again
Frightened it rears and Judith caught off balance is
thrown her foot catching in the stirrup

JUDITH
GRAAACE

Her horse unable to find its balance starts to slide backward
down the incline

GRACE
PILGRIM COME ON MOVE

Grace directly behind Judith tries to turn Pilgrim to avoid
being hit by the errant horse

What follows we see from Graces perspective The details
that form the images and sounds of Graces mind are fast
disembodies almost surreal as --

Judiths horse bulldozes into Pilgrim taking his legs out
from under him sending both horses careening down the icy
slope Grace hangs onto Pilgrims neck Judith her leg
helplessly tangled in the stirrup is dragged her head
bouncing on the frozen ground

They slide all the way back down to the COUNTRY ROAD Pilgrim
is the first to find his legs and stand Grace manages to sit
up in the saddle She sees Judiths horse stumbling back onto
its feet one of his legs broken at the ankles walking in
confused circles dragging Judith -- her face bleeding her
leg hanging from the stirrup

GRACE
(frightened)
Jude you okay

JUDITH
(softly crying)
Im okay Im okay
She tries to extricate her leg from the stirrup

Grace sees it before she hears it A GLINT off of steel We
then hear the rumbling SOUND of a TRUCK coming around the
bend The Girls on their horses in the middle of the road
The Truck an 18 wheeler carrying logging equipment comes
around the turn Grace grabs the bridle trying to get
Judiths horse out of the road The driver seeing them lays
on the air horn The Horses bolt at the sound the bridle
slipping out of Graces hand

GRACE
JUUDE

The horses turn apart The Driver starts furiously
downshifting trying to brake He seems to get it under
control when suddenly THE TRUCK SKIDS on some ice It begins
to slide out of control the truck bed and the cab jack-
knifing The truck literally plows over the helpless Judith
and her horse -- the horse going down on the pavement Judith
disappearing under him The trucks cab like a mythic
monster heads right for Grace and Pilgrim Grace looks
right into the Drivers helpless frightened eyes Suddenly
Pilgrim rears up at the truck sending Grace flying bouncing
her off the pavement and under the wheel of the truc

Pilgrim instinctively jumps onto the hood of the truck his
hooves caught between the rear-view mirrors like some
grotesque ornament His head and chest slams into the window
shattering through the glass

And then it is still

The truck has stopped halfway in the road Judiths horse
lies in the road motionless Pilgrim on the trucks hood
his legs splayed stuck his head and chest bleeding He
shrieks struggling to get to his feet He manages to free
his legs and stepping off the cab onto the road walks off
wounded in pain into the sanctuary of the woods

The Driver stumbles out of the cab his head bleeding in
shock He sits on the ground All we hear is the sound of the
river and the wind in the trees

Grace halfway under the truck frozen stares up at the
beautiful morning sky

WE HEAR THE SOUND OF A HELICOPTER

INT MACLEAN FARMHOUSEKITCHEN - LATER MORNING
ANGLE ON GRACES NOTE on the refrigerator as Robert enters
from the outside with two bags of groceries He places them on
the counter near the PHONE MACHINE He sees ONE MESSAGE is
there He presses PLAY as he puts away the groceries

A BEAT LATER the PHONE RINGS and he picks up with the machine
still playing

(on phone)
Hello Paul hi -- are you guys back

inside pulls his attention On hearing accident Robert
lowers the receiver frozen as he listens to Liz

LIZ
(on machine)

Robert just call me on my call phone
1-917-449-7805

EXT THE WOODS - LATE MORNING

Pilgrim is hiding in the shadows under an old railroad bridge
standing up to his knees in the river His chest is cut open
bleeding His face cut contorted and swollen LIZ HAMMOND
the local veterinarian hides a hypodermic needle in her
jacket quietly walking into the water

A Policeman is going into the water downstream from Pilgrim
whose chest is heaving blood drips into the water He
watches Liz She is almost to him when suddenly he bolts
running upstream

The Policeman behind him shouts and waves his arm Frightened
Pilgrim wheels back toward Liz who manages to stick the hypo
in his neck He rears knocking her down then runs out of
the river the hypo still in his neck He runs for the
sanctuary of the woods

INT TRAIN - LATE MORNING

Annie sits on a train -- her laptop out notes beside her
her cellular phone ever-ready The train passes through
beautiful countryside but Annie is focused on an editorial
shes writing

The train pulls into a station and stops causing Annie to
take a break and stretch her arms and neck She looks out the
window for the first time and sees

A MAN his hands in his pockets waiting on the platform She
watches as the Man holds out his arms to his two young
children who are getting off the train He picks them up as
his wife enters the scene kissing him and wrapping her arm
around his waist The children talk a mile a minute and the
father listens to every word

Annie doesnt even realize she is staring As they leave the

platform she turns back to her laptop As the train begins
to move again Annie returns to work

HER CELLULAR PHONE RINGS She answers

ANNIE
Yeah Hi I made the 100 so

The expression on her face sinks into a stunned panic

INT HOSPITAL CONNECTICUT - DAY

Annie is running through the corridors her bags in tow She
sees Robert standing in the corridor talking to a DOCTOR She

runs for them

When she appears Robert and the Doctor stop their
conversation Robert looks to Annie who is waiting for news

ANNIE

ROBERT
Judiths dead

Annies horrified waiting for news of Grace

ANNIE

ROBERT
(interrupting)
Annie her leg was shattered -- what
they call the distal epi epi

DOCTOR
Distal epicondyle of the femur

ROBERT
(quietly crying)
They have to take the leg off

Annie responds without tears and cries but with a quiet
shock We can tell her mind is racing trying to process the
information until finally she asks

ANNIE
Which leg

The Doctor and Robert are surprised by the question

ROBERT
What difference does it make

Annie stares for a beat then nods apologetically

EXT WOODS - DAY

Pilgrim is sedated lying in his own blood in the snow
surrounded by Police and trackers He is being attended to by
LIZ HAMMOND who is dictating to her assistant

LIZ
His skull cheek and nose are
severely fractured He has a deep
chest wound Im not even sure it
can be closed

LOCAL TRACKER
(deadpan local accent)
Animal should be put down -- anybody can
see that

Liz looks up to him resentfully but knows hes right
INT GRACES HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

Camera moves from Graces face down her body to Roberts
hand which rubs her good leg He looks at her lovingly
pushing the hair from her forehead

Annie needing to do something tenderly straightens Graces
blankets It is plain to see where her leg had once been
Robert cant look Annie one to face her fears bravely
looks at it head on She notices the IV Bag and rises on

ANNIE
That bags almost empty

ROBERT
(looking)
No its got a little left Theyll be
in to change it

ANNIE
(as she exits)

ANNIE (0S)

Annie enters first

ANNIE
You have to keep on top of these people
or else they just sit on their --

But Robert is ignoring her Facing Grace smoothing away her
hair Hes giving her the silent treatment Annie knows this
means Robert doesnt approve of her dictatorial behavior
Annoyed she turns away as well
The Nurse enters with a new bag and begins to replace the old
one as Robert backs away

ROBERT
Im sorry

ANNIE
Tch What are you --

Annie about to respond to his inappropriate politeness is
stopped by Robert who finally looks at her Its a powerful
look that tells her to calm down and shut up Its a look
that for all of Roberts sensitivity affects Annie She
gets the message and stays calm

As the nurse leaves Annie is about to say thank you but
Robert beats her to it

ROBERT
Thank you

Annie and Robert stand facing each other when the PHONE RINGS
Annie picks up

INTERCUT

LIZ

Oh God Annie Im so sorry I I

Pilgrim

Annie hears the name as if its some distant echo she cant
quite identify Liz speaks quickly as Annie watches Grace
breathing in her sleep --

LIZ

ROBERT
Nothing new Hes just going off duty
g

Beat Silence
ANNIE

Im going to get all the nurses
names Its good to know all their
names

Robert nods But neither of them moves They stand motionless
for a beat then Annie begins to break down and eases herself
into Roberts arms

Robert embraces her kissing her head with an almost fatherly
comfort His expression tells us its the moment hes been
expecting and wanting Now shell be all right in his arms
Whatever distance between them whatever problems felt
insurmountable last night on the phone are now for the moment
-- for Robert -- gone

But Annies expression tells us something different Her
instinct to hold him was honest but the effect isnt the
same anymore Something doesnt feel right Something isnt
working anymore about his comforting embrace

ANNIE
I should go get some of her things

ROBERT
No let me go
ANNIE
(gently pushing away)
No Ill go You stay In case she

wakes up
INT THE UNIVERSITY ANIMAL HOSPITAL RECOVERY STALLS - NIGHT

A line of recovery stalls with various sick and hurt animals
Liz exhausted asleep on a chair outside a stall Theres a
slight scratching sound A hoof against the stall It gets
louder awakening Liz She gets up and looks inside the
paddled stall

Pilgrim is lying in the stall heavily bandaged He is waking
up His first instinct is to kick at the paddled stall walls
He looks at Liz his eyes filled with madness -- enraged to
still be alive

INT GRACES BEDROOM IN FARMHOUSE - NIGHT

Annie opens the door and enters flicking on the light
Camera is on her back as she places a small suitcase on the
bed and opens it She begins her task with cool efficiency
Opening drawers and closets assessing what should be taken
what isnt necessary

Suddenly she stops She feels disoriented for a moment She
cant remember the last time she was inside this room She
takes a moment to pause and actually look around

In the light we now see more of Graces inner sanctum Horse
riding prize ribbons in various colors adorn the walls
Books A girls bureau cluttered with teenage possession
ranging from childhood toys to items that suggest a reaching
towards adulthood Annie examines some items affectionately
A GOOD LUCK CHARM from India sits among her things Annie
takes it to pack in the suitcase

She notices a framed 8X10 of Grace sitting proudly atop
Pilgrim with Judith at her heel She then notices the edge of
another picture behind this one in the frame She pulls the
Pilgrim photo out to reveal An old 8X10 of Annie hugging
Grace as a toddler With her back to Camera Annie remembers

MEMORY
INT GRACES ROOM - A DAY REMEMBERED

Annie is playing with toddler Grace Chasing her around the
room Picking her and tossing her onto a small toddler bed
Blowing into her stomach Grace is laughing uncontrollably

END OF MEMORY

Annie slides the Pilgrim picture back into the frame then
returns to her task of packing

INT GRACES HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

Annie enters No one else is there She places the suitcase
on a chair and opens it She takes out the INDIAN LUCKY CHARM
and some horse books and places them on her bedside table
She takes care to prop up the Lucky Charm

She wets a cloth with some water from a pitcher and gently
wipes Graces sweaty brow INSERT VISUAL FLASHBACK HERE
instead of in Country House

Annie then continues unpacking the suitcase She opens
Graces closet and sees a hospital bag filled with Graces
clothes at the time of the accident Annie examines them and
discovers they are hers Annie shoves the clothes into a bag
and starts unpacking

INT HOSPITAL CAFETERIA - PRE-DAWN

The Clock is ticking on the wall The cafeteria is empty
except for one tired Intern drinking coffee on a break

Robert and Annie are having a cup of coffee In the silence
they search for things to say Until

ROBERT

I saw Judiths parents while you were
at the apartment

(Annie listens)
I wanted to say something

(beat)
But I I was so relieved that Grace
was still that it wasnt our daughter

ANNIE
Were very lucky

ROBERT
(nods)
The funerals on Friday

He rises and crosses to the self-help coffee dispenser as he
continues

ROBERT
Oh uh I meant to tell you Alex
brought that fabric over

ANNIE
Okay

ROBERT
Its on the table by the phone I didnt
know what to tell him
(returns to table sits)
Whether or not we were
(beat)
if we still were thinking of redoing
the couch

Annie just nods She senses Robert is looking for some kind
of reassurance but she cant give it to him He continues

ROBERT
And uh Mario called about moving
the wisteria
ANNIE

Oh Right Ill call him
Pause Annie looks at her husband as he stares off to the
side deep in his thoughts She can sense hes sinking as he

fidgets with the napkins She remembers

MEMORY
INT A SMALLER APARTMENT KITCHEN - A NIGHT REMEMBERED

A younger Annie stands in a bathrobe noticeably pregnant
cooking at a stove -- reading instructions from a propped up
cookbook FRANK SINATRA IS BLASTING as she sings along in
full voice without inhibitions

ANNIE
SHES LOVES THE THEATRE BUT NEVER COMES
LATE SHE NEVER BOTHERS WITH PEOPLE SHE

HATES THATS WHY THE LADY IS A TRAMP

A younger Robert wearing a suit arrives home from work
Seeing

her he smiles affectionately He puts down his briefcase and

bursts into his own playful Sinatra impersonation

ROBERT
She loves the free

Startled Annie turns around and smiles

ROBERT
(sexily undoing his tie)
FRESH WIND IN HER HAIR LIFE
WITHOUT CARE SHES BROKE BUT
ITS OK

ANNIE
(a la fan)
Sing it to me Frankie

ROBERT
(a la Sinatra cool)
Hows my pregnant chick

She moves to him and they embrace He wraps his arms around
her They kiss Annie laughs

ANNIE
You can hardly get your arms around me
How depressing Youre so early

ROBERT
I had to excuse myself from a meeting
Its ridiculous I kept thinking about

the baby you and I swear I was
going to start bawling right into my
briefs

ANNIE
(loving it)
Aw thats so sweet

ROBERT
I love you

ANNIE
Do you Do you really

They turn to each other and kiss
END OF MEMORY
INT HOSPITAL CAFETERIA - PRE-DAWN

Annie and Robert sit silently at the table in an empty hospital
cafeteria a lifetime later

INT GRACES HOSPITAL ROOM - DAYBREAK
The rooms lights are dimmed Dawn is being to break through

Grace slowly opens her eyes coming out of sedation She
takes a moment to figure out where she is to remember

She uses her hands to hoist herself up but shes unsteady
and knocks into her bedside table -- knocking the Good Luck
Charm from India off the table It rolls under the bed with
a water tumbler Grace never sees the Charm

Grace looks where her leg once was She feels the blanket

the empty space where her leg once was just like her mother
did (did her father couldnt) Instead of self-pity shes
oddly fascinated

DISSOLVE TO

Daylight pours in Robert and Annie enter Robert loaded
with gifts immediately crosses to Grace on the side of her

tightly Grace responds by wrapping her hand around her

mothers They exchange a look of respect and gratitude

GRACE
Annie

to each other through their separate mirrors as they wash up

for bed

ANNIE
Youve got to stop doing that
ROBERT
Doing what

ANNIE
Helping all the time Running to her
every time she trips or falls
Anticipating her all the time

Robert shuts off his sink and dries his face without a word
He exits into the bedroom and gets into bed For a beat he

stares up at the ceiling -- then says quite plainly
ROBERT
You know Annie this didnt just happen
to you

Annie is applying moisturizer when she hears this As it
sinks in she doesnt like it

INT GRACES BEDROOM - NIGHT

towards her bureau without them It is a struggle but she
does almost falling but grabbing the bureau just in time
The 8X10 of her and Pilgrim falls face down She props it up
and looks at it -- focusing on her horse then on Judith
Suddenly she lashes out knocking the photograph onto the
floor

the pavements then turns for her bag

Annie notices other kids looking at Grace from behind as they
enter the school

ANNIE
Dad1l pick you up today all right

GRACE

Grace looks up to her mother What is unspoken between them
is the understanding that today will be difficult and theres
nothing either one can do about it

ANNIE
Youll be fine

Grace nods and turns to the school Annie watches her go
INT GRACES SCHOOL - MORNING

Grace makes her way through the hall It is the first time
she has had to maneuver through a crowd Some of the younger

through trying to maintain her balance and her sanity

As Grace slowly moves along whatever small faith she had
that she could get through this day begins to diminish

GRACE
Why is he in the back Why isnt he in

Liz stops causing everyone to stop She turns to face Grace
realizing she doesnt know She looks at Robert and Annie
accusingly She tries to explain

LIZ
Well Grace you see Pilgrim just
isnt the same horse he used to be
(to the parents)
As a matter of fact maybe nows not
the best time to --

GRACE
I really want to see him

Liz looks at Annie Annie nods Liz leads them on

They reach a row of empty old stalls They cross to one of
the stalls -- its doors are closed Liz draws back the bolt
on top half of the door

There is an immediate explosion of sound inside the stall
the sound of fear startling them Then its still Liz
slowly opens the door Grace with the aide of her cane
walks to the stall She hesitates then looks in It takes a
moment for her eyes to grow accustomed to the dark She sees
Pilgrim with his head down in the shadows

GRACE
Hello beautiful boy

He lifts his head at the sound of her voice Grace and the
audience see him for the first time -- His mad eyes his
terrible disfigurement

Grace cries out stepping backwards nearly stumbling in the
mud What is left of her horse are gone Annie realizes
whats happened and together with Robert rush to her They
too see the monster Pilgrim has become and are horrified
Grace angrily pushes away from them and runs off Robert
goes after her

Annie is standing in the rain with Liz -- her eyes unable to
move away from the sight of Pilgrim

LIZ (0S)
You should have told her Annie I
tried to explain to you how bad it was
I guess you had to see it But theres
nothing to be done This animals beyond
help Annie can I have your permission
now to put him down

Annie stands in the rain hands in pocket fixed on Pilgrim
and more determined than ever

ANNIE
No

EXT CENTRAL PARK WEST APARTMENT - NIGHT

Alone in her study Annie sits before her computer searching
the Internet for information on HORSES -- Veterinarian
Journals Therapies Accidents Eistories We sense shes
been at it a while

She locates an ITEM TITLE -- HORSE WHISPERERS Interested she
brings it up on the screen

INT NEW YORK PUBLIC LIBRARY - NIGHT

Annie sits in the huge reading room books spread out before
her under a green reading lamp Her voice tells us what shes
reading

ANNIE (VO)
It was in America that horses first
roamed

In the books we see pictures lithographs paintings and
drawings

ANNIE (VO)
A million years before the birth of
man they grazed the vast empty plains of
grass and crossed to other continents
over bridges of rocks They first knew
man as the hunted knows the hunter for
long before man saw horses as a means to
killing other beasts man killed them for
meat

ANNIES VO CONTINUES OVER
INT PILGRIMS STALL - NIGHT

ANNIE (VO)
The alliance with man would forever

be fragile -- for the fear hed struck
into their hearts was too deep to be
dislodged Since that Neolithic moment

when a horse was first haltered there
were those among men who understood
this

INT GRACES ROOM - NIGHT
Grace sits alone in her darkened room staring out the window
but not looking at anything Theres a discomforting distance
in her expression

ANNIE (VO)
They could see into the creatures
soul and soothe the wounds they found
there

DISSOLVE TO
EXT A FAIRGROUNDS PARKING LOT CALIFORNIA - DAY

A hot dusty fairgrounds horse arena The worn wooden
bleachers
crowded Lines of cars and pick-up trucks

ANNIE (VO)
For secrets uttered softly into
troubled ears these men were known as
The Whisperers

One particular pick-up truck has its back door opened A
MANS LEG is sticking out putting on a pair of boots

A moment later the Man gets out of the car Holding a cowboy
hat he has a certain quality a self-respect that men who
know themselves seem to have TOM BOOKER

A weathered redheaded woman named RONA -- late forties strong
wiry horsewomans build -- is walking towards him
RONA

Hey darlin

TOM
Hey Rona Sorry Im late

RONA
I wouldnt know what to do if you were
on time

They walk together towards the fairgrounds

TOM
Youre looking fit

RONA
Fit You want to check my teeth
(Tom laughs)
Good crowd today I think youll have
some fun You going to stay for dinner

TOM
If its not too much trouble I thought
I might

RONA

(playful)
Kind of trouble Im in the mood for

TOM
Oh-oh Maybe I better get back in the
truck

Rona lets out a hearty laugh as they enter the horse arena

EXT HORSE ARENA CALIFORNIA - DAY

Inside the corral a small black thoroughbred is being worked
by Tom As he rides and narrates into a radio microphone to
the crowd we sense this is a man of good humor and great
skill -- guileless sensible of the earth

TOM
Its always kind of interesting to
hear the horses side of the story

The crowd laughs warmly He directs his comments to a WOMAN
wearing an expensive Ralph Lauren western outfit standing
outside the corral

TOM
Now if he was cranky or lazy like you
say he is wed be seeing his tail
twitching there and his ears back
maybe But this isnt a cranky horse
its a scared horse You see how braced
he is up around the neck back there
He just doesnt know which way to turn

The Woman nods Tom turns the horse on a dime so that he
always stays facing the circling thoroughbred

TOM
You see how he keeps pointing his
hindquarters in at me Well Id guess
the reason he seems reluctant to move
out is because when he does he gets in
trouble for it

THE WOMAN
Hes not good at transitions you know
When I want him to move from a trot toa
lope say

TOM

(smiles)
Well Im sure thats what you think but
thats not what Im seeing You may think
youre asking for a lope but your body
may be saying something else altogether
You might be putting too many conditions
on him For instance you might be saying
GO but hey dont go too fast He can
tell that from the way you feel Your
body cant lie You ever give him a kick
to make him move out

THE WOMAN
He wont go unless I do

TOM
And then he goes and you feel like hes
going too fast so you yank him back
(she nods)
And next thing you know hes bucking
(she nods again)
Well if someone told you to go stop
go stop -- youd buck too

The people laugh The Woman smiles self-consciously

TOM
ts a dance see Somebody has to lead
and somebody has to follow

Tom gracefully moves his horse around the ring dancing He
then takes up a long coiled rope and throws it so that the
coils slap against the black horses flank making it burst
into a lope And again Making the animal go from a trot to
a lope letting it slow then up to a lope again

TOM
want him to get so he can leave real
soft Hes getting the idea now Hes
not all braced up and tense like he was
at the start Hes finding out its okay

He throws the rope again and this time the transition to the
lope is a smooth one

TOM
You see that Hes getting better
already Pretty soon if you work at
it youll be able to make all these
transitions easy on a loose rein
(sotto voce wry)
Yeah and pigsll fly
(to Woman)
Hes going to be okay -- so long as you
dont go yanking on him

She nods but he can see shes upset feeling foolish He
walks the horse over to her turns off the microphone and
speaks sympathetically

TOM
Look the truth is its all about self-
preservation These animals
(with great affection)

well they just have such big hearts
you know Theres nothing they want more
than to do what you want them to do But
when the messages get all confused the
only thing they know to do is try and
save themselves Now why dont you go
saddle up and see what happens

Feeling better and not a little attracted to his heartfelt
mans man the Woman smiles and reaches for his hand to climb
over the rail Her horse lets her come right up to him and
stroke his neck Tom comments

TOM
They wont ever hold a thing against
you Theyre the most forgiving
creatures God ever made

Turning on his mike and turning back to the crowd he says

TOM
Okay whos next

A Young Boy leads a mule into the ring Tom smiles
TOM
Now God has another idea entirely with
the mule

EXT THE FAIRGROUNDS - LATER THAT DAY

Tom has finished his show People are shaking his hand
thanking him as he walks away from the corral towards a
trailer

The Woman in the Ralph Lauren approaches
WOMAN
Excuse me

He faces the Woman

WOMAN
Hi Im Dale I just wanted to -- I cant
get over the way he felt under me after
youd finish with him Everything had
just I dont know freed up or something

The Woman is flirting Tom shrugs uncomfortably

TOM
Well thatll happen

WOMAN
Where did you learn all this stuff

TOM
What stuff is that

WOMAN
About horses Id love to learn more
about it myself Do you offer any
private lessons for riders

TOM
(getting the message)
Well Dale you know a lot of this
stuff it just nuts and bolts
WOMAN

What do you mean

TOM
Well if the riders nuts the horse
bolts
(smiles)
Thats the whole lesson right there
You have a good day now Just keep

on freeing yourself up
He leaves her entering the trailer
INT RONAS TRAILER - NIGHT
A small well-used trailer Tom and Rona are finishing dinner

like comfortable old friends Rona rises taking the plates
into the kitchen and starts rinsing them
RONA
Oh I clear forget You had a call from
some woman in New York She sounded
pretty wound up

TOM
I dont any woman in New York But from
what I hear most of them are wound up

RONA
The numbers by the phone

He nods but doesnt move He just looks at Rona and smiles
Shes a good woman But Tom hopes she doesnt want anymore
than what they have together Rona notices him looking and
smiles

RONA
What are you looking at young man

TOM
How long were you married

RONA
Long enough

TOM
You ever miss it

RONA
Does a horse miss a saddle

TOM
Sometimes

She chuckles shuts the water off and crosses back to him
sitting beside him

RONA
Well as a matter of fact I dont most
of the time

She starts unbuttoning his shirt

TOM
You know Rona we werent all that good
together even when we were good together

RONA
Honey I was always good

Tom smiles as Rona leans in They kiss

her horse They were both injured and
she my daughter she hasnt been able
to fully uh It was an extremely
traumatic experience and uh

Tom sensing her turmoil listening compassionately
ANNIE

success rate when it comes to traumatized --

TOM
Well see truth is maam I help horses

publisher of the article I called
Montana and your sister-in-law I think

coming to New York and taking a look at
my daughters horse and possibly --

TOM
Maam Im very sorry about your problems

a ranch to take care of

ANNIE
(interrupts abruptly)
Ill pay you for your fare Ill send you
to Montana first class

TOM
(getting impatient)
Maam first class to Montana is a waste
of good money Now am I being too polite
here or when I say NO in Utah does that
mean YES in New York City

Annie is taken aback Tom feels badly

TOM
I I dont mean to sound insensitive I
understand your situation But theres
nothing I can do You just called the
wrong person thats all I hear there

Maybe you should call one of them

ANNIE
Mr Booker if I could just ex --

TOM

He hangs up before Annie can continue
INT GRACES BEDROOM - NIGHT

Annie reaches for Graces bedroom door then pauses She
realizes she should knock She does and whispers

ANNIE
Grace
(knocks again)
Grace its mom

Annie slowly opens the door She finds Graces bed empty She
looks over to the window to find Grace sitting in a chair in
the dark looking out the window

ANNIE
Grace What are you doing

Not looking up Grace speaks in a hollow voice

GRACE
I cant find that charm Daddy gave me
from India

ANNIE
I brought it to you in the hospital

GRACE
No you didnt

ANNIE
Grace I put it on the table near your --
GRACE
(apathetic)
Doesnt matter

Beat

ANNIE
Have you decided about Pilgrim

GRACE
What about him
ANNIE
Well how you feel all right about

telling Liz to put him down

GRACE
I think we should Its not fair to let
him suffer Hes not much use anymore
Hed hate living like that

ANNIE
I think thats very compassionate
and mature way of looking at it
GRACE
Mom
ANNIE
Yeah
GRACE

Maybe they should put me down too

ANNIE
What

GRACE
I mean Im not much use anymore Why
cant they be compassionate to me
What frightens Annie most is the calm and apathy in Graces
voice Shes surrendering Annie for the first time ina
long time feels shes losing control

INT CENTRAL PARK WEST APARTMENT - NIGHT

Annie sits alone at the kitchen table nursing a glass of
wine

Robert enters and sits opposite her wearing a tuxedo -- his
tie and collar undone

ANNIE
How was the dinner

ROBERT

(wry)
All our favorite people were there
saying all their favorite things about
their favorite subjects I thought to
myself weve been friends with these
people almost twenty years and nobody
knows anybody Were so afraid we wont
like each other and have nobody go to
dinners with

ANNIE
Why did you go

ROBERT
(surprised)
Theyre still our friends Annie Its
nothing serious You kid about them all
the time And I could tell Paul really
appreciated me being there

He drinks Annies wine as she looks at him

Robert

ROBERT
Did you get a hold of that horse guy

ANNIE
Yeah

ROBERT
What did he say

ANNIE
No

nods Accepting Silence Annie sips her wine

ROBERT
I was thinking Maybe we should think
about the three of us going someplace
warm Remember that house we rented in
Bermuda The pink one with the --

His arm accidentally spills the wine

ROBERT
Shit

Then
As he bends down to wipe it up with a napkin Annie watches
Robert clean the spill Something about his movements his

posture -- a sense of weakness of surrendering of not having
the inclination to fight of just accepting and smoothing
over the rough sports -- strikes her hard Annie realizes the

love she feels for Robert isnt fading Its gone
He finishes cleaning and sits

ROBERT
What was I saying

ANNIE
About us going someplace warm
Someplace Gracell have to wear shorts
or bathing suits or summer dresses

Robert looks at her and realizes its a bad idea He nods
again getting the message Silence In that silence Annie

looks at him and makes a decision
ANNIE
Robert I want to take Pilgrim out to Mr
Booker Drive him out to Montana With
Grace
Robert is confused and a little worried
ROBERT
I dont understand You just said he
said no
ANNIE
He did but I think I can change his
mind
ROBERT

Thats the craziest thing I ever heard
Absolutely not

ANNIE
Robert Grace isnt adjusting to school
And she cant sit in this apartment all
day I think it would be good for her

ROBERT
(at a loss)

NO What are you -- youre serious about
this

ANNIE
Ive called Liz They can set me up with
a trailer for Pilgrim I thought wed
stay at motels along the way

ROBERT
(overlapping)
Youve already made arrangements

ANNIE
No I was just researching Calm down

ROBERT
I come home and you tell me were going
to drive a psychotic horse to Montana I
cant just pick up and leave

ANNIE
Im not asking you to Ill do it

ROBERT
You want to do this by yourself How
You cant take care of Pilgrim all the --

ANNIE
Hell be sedated I know horses Robert
Im the one who taught Grace how to ride

ROBERT
(overlapping)
What Bo- What about the magazine
ANNIE

Im in charge I went back very soon
after the accident They didnt expect me
for a couple of months Ill just take
that time now I can still oversee
things from Montana Take my fax

My computer

Beat Robert fears this is about the marriage Yet --
ROBERT

No Its uh No I really dont think
its a good idea

ANNIE
Why
ROBERT
(searching)
Her psychiatrist said she needs

security now stability
ANNIE
I cant say hes been all that effective

with her

ROBERT
Are you a psychiatrist He said it takes
time

ANNIE

I dont care what he says We have to do
something Robert I cant sit here and
trust everythings going to work out just
by pretending it will

ROBERT
Im not pretending anything

Beat Robert just stares at her He looks concerned almost
worried Annie gets uncomfortable

ANNIE
What

It is very difficult for Robert to say

ROBERT
I thought well ever since the
accident I just thought we

He stops Annie knows where he headed and prays to God he
doesnt continue He doesnt A thick silence hangs between
them

ROBERT
I really wish I could understand why
you think this is so necessary

ANNIE

(frustrated)
Robert were losing her Were losing
her

(he listens)
I dont care what the doctors say The
truth is they dont know anymore than
we do -- less when it comes to Grace
This may not sound sensible or logical
but nobodys suggesting anything better
I cant explain it Robert I just have
this feeling this annoying bloody
feeling that if if somehow Pilgrim
can be made all right then so can Grace
I just know it

Robert can feel the strength of her will He can find no way
around it

ROBERT
What if she doesnt want to go

ANNIE
She will if you think she should

ROBERT
And you think its best if I dont come

ANNIE
(hesitates)
No thats not what I said Im not a
dictator If you feel you should come
then come Just do whatever you think
is right

At some moment they realize Grace is standing at the entrance
to the kitchen They are surprised

GRACE
Im not going I dont care what she
says

Annie lowers her head Robert stares at Grace as she walks to
him

GRACE
Daddy I dont want to go

Grace stands next to Robert He holds her hands Annie looks
at him without sympathy Robert looks back In his face is

the total acceptance of what must be As well as the sadness
of its inevitability He looks back at his daughter whose

eyes have never left him

EXT JOAN DYER STABLE - DAY

Pilgrim is being loaded into the trailer by four strong stable
men violently kicking and pulling all the way

Annie watches with anxiety -- an almost giddy Liz by her side
ANNIE
Maybe we should give him another
sedative

LIZ
Problem is there arent many
volunteers Hes already had enough
to sink a battleship You have a
pin just in case

ANNIE
Of course not

LIZ
Probably best You may want to shoot
yourself half way to Ohio

In the back seat of ANNIES SUBURBAN sits Grace -- her back to

EXT A HIGHWAY IN PENNSYLVANIA - DAY

Annies Suburban drives along Route 80 pulling the horse
trailer behind

INT SUBURBAN - DAY

Grace in the back seat wearing her headphones listening to
her music (maybe LIZ PHAITR OR HOLLY COLE) Detached Non-

she reacts and turns to the other window

Annie in sunglasses shifts her attention between the road
and her rear-view mirror -- checking on Grace

INT MOTEL ROOM OHIO - NIGHT

A small furnished motel room with two twin beds

with canned laughter serves as a hypnotic drug

Annie enters from the bathroom after showering drying her
hair Grace doesnt bother to look up

ANNIE
You want to take your bath

(Grace shakes her head)
We have to get up early tomorrow You

GRACE

that we may not have enough --

GRACE
-- enough time tomorrow I know

ANNIE
Look if you want to take it in the
morning thats fine

GRACE
(interrupts on fine)

Annie realizes she may have pushed too hard but she also
realizes theres no talking to Grace now So she achieves

her goal --

JANNIE
Take it now

Grace hobbles off the bed enters the bathroom and shuts the
door

INT MOTEL ROOM IN OHIO - NIGHT

The lights are off Annie lays in bed wide awake It is the
middle of the night

Grace asleep in the other bed begins whimpering Shes

having a bad dream Annie rises -- considering whether or not
to intercede Finally Grace begins to cry out softly at
first but with increasing intensity until she awakens in
fear Annie appears right by her side

ANNIE

What sweetheart What

Shaken Grace cannot fight how much she needs her mother at
that moment She wraps her arms around her tightly and tries
to catch her breath
ANNIE
Its sleeping in a strange bed

ANNIE
Okay listen -- lets do this When

the trailer behind them As if Pilgrim made a sudden move
Grace quickly turns her head Annie looks in the rear view at
Grace

ANNIE
Uh Lucy look I have to go OK
Later

Annie hangs up and smiles at Grace through the mirror Grace
reaches for her walkman and headphones Annie offers

ANNIE
Grace GRACE

Grace lowers one side of her headphones

ANNIE
Would you like to put your music on
up here

Grace shrugs Annie shrugs it off as well Grace replaces the
headphone Annie turns on the radio -- nothing but country or
gospel or religious talk shows She shuts it off Frustrated
Annie looks up ahead and sees

A TRUCK STOP DINER
Annie yells to be heard through the headphones

ANNIE
ITS ALMOST LUNCHTIME ARE YOU
HUNGRY

GRACE

(shrugs)

ANNIE

GRACE

Annoyed Annie pulls onto the gravel and stops talking to
herself --

ANNIE
Fine

She exits the car banging the door As she walks acrund the
car to help Grace she talks to herself in a sarcastic whisper

ANNIE
Whatever you want Well this is what
I want I want to eat lunch and I want
to smoke a cigarette and I want to keep
talking to myself for the next two
thousand fucking miles

She opens Graces door Grace senses her mothers anger
INT TRUCK STOP DINER - DAY

Annie and Grace enter They look around

Formica floors truckers in caps and beer bellies stuffed
into booths or at the counter There is not a single space
available

Annie and Grace stand near the entrance Another Trucker
enters and they step aside huddled together in this foreign
land

DISSOLVE TO
LATER

Grace is asleep in her twin bed Once again Annie is wide
awake The clock reads 455 AM But Annie can not sleep
Camera moves away from Annie past her side of the bed to
the other side of the room

WE SEE THE SHADOW OF A WOMAN coming towards the bed She
comes in camera angle and we follow to her back to the bed
which has now transformed into --

A BED FROM THE PAST IN WHICH A TEN-YEAR-OLD ANNIE IS
SLEEPING WITH HER YOUNGER BROTHER GEORGE

WE ARE IN MEMORY
The Woman gently shakes little Annie awaken

WOMAN
Annie Annie sweetheart wake

The little girl with sleep in her eyes turns and sees her

END OF MEMORY

Annie in present time next to Grace thinks of this as she
stays awake Putting her jogging parka on over her nightgown
she goes outside

EXT IOWA MOTEL - NIGHT

She crosses the motel parking lot to the horse trailer She
looks in through the siding at Pilgrim checking on him She
sees he is caught his halter on the side of the van She
crosses to the trailer door hesitates then opens it
Pilgrim looks at her Gathering her courage she climbs
inside He is still looking at her She carefully frees his
halter And suddenly he bares his teeth biting at her She
stumbles back out of the trailer slamming the door shut She
stands leaning against the trailer -- wondering if shes out
of her mind for attempting this

DISSOLVE TO
EXT IOWA MOTEL - LATER THAT SAME MORNING

Annie is returning from her jog sweating As she crosses to
her motel room she stops by the window looking in to see

Grace on the floor straining to do her exercises

Annie fills with compassion for her girl -- reminded of the
struggle she faces everyday

EXT THE BADLANDS - DAY

In the distance the Suburban and horse trailer look like a
dot on the horizon moving across the Badlands

INT THE SUBURBAN - ANOTHER TIME DUSK

Grace leans against the window in the back in one of her
darker moods Annie switches radio stations from Bible
thumping to Farm reports She shuts it off Silence

She sees a ROAD SIGH LITTLE BIGHORN NATIONAL MONUMENT

ANNIE
Grace look

Grace reads the sign
ANNIE
Would you like to see that

GRACE
I dont care
ANNIE
(overlapping)

I dont care
Annies comic mimicking throws Grace off center

Annie turns off onto the exit They drive by a massive casino
-- its neon sign flickering They drive up a hill past a cafe
two Indians in high crowned Cowboy hats standing outside of
the cafe She drives up a hill towards the parking lot of the
Monument

ANNIE
Thisll be nice We havent seen any
of the sights yet Its history When
I was thirteen I used to love seeing
things like this

GRACE
You were never thirteen Mom

Annie laughs taking it as a joke Grace almost smiles

But Annie drives up to sign only to find a CLOSED SIGN The
park was closed at six Annie stops the car Shes hit a
brick wall once more Silence Finally Grace speaks with her
usual sarcasm

GRACE
Great idea So now what

Beat Annies patience snaps

ANNIE
How long is this going to go on

GRACE
What

ANNIE
You know what I mean
(turns to the back seat)
Is this it now Is this the way were
going to be from now on

Ignoring her Grace edges to the passenger side and exits the
car Annie gets out of the drivers side and walks around as
she speaks

ANNIE
Do you want us to turn around and go
back home Do you

GRACE
What are you asking me for You didnt
ask me if I wanted to come in the first
place -- now I get to decide Forget it

She begins to turn away Annie grabs her arm

ANNIE
Who do you think Im doing this for
Im doing this for you

GRACE
Bullshit Its about you About you
deciding About you always being
right You always getting everything
your way controlling everybody --
like we work for you or something

ANNIE
I dont believe this

GRACE
You just want to get away from Daddy
and youre using me to do it

ANNIE
Thats not true Whatever problems your
father and I are having have nothing
to do with this

GRACE

Youre amazing You act like I dont
live in that house Dont you think I
hear the two of you Dont you think
I can tell whats going on Im not
five years old Mom

(Annie is stopped)
You want to divorce Daddy and Daddy
doesnt want to

ANNIE
Did he tell you that

GRACE
He doesnt have to Its like so
obvious you cant stand him

ANNIE
Thats not true

fq

GRACE
Then why do you want to leave

ANNIE
ts its not that simple to explain
know you think it is but its not
The truth is I dont really know what
want to do I dont have all the
answers

GRACE
No you just act like you do

Annie is choked with fury She doesnt know whether to
scream cry or strangle Grace She turns away and begins
walking quickly blindly up past a grove of trees She comes
to a CEMETERY enclosed by a black railing At the crest of
the hill theres a stone monument The Little Bighorn
Cemetery

In the growing darkness she sees scattered on the hillsides
below her white tombstones A place of sorrow A cool breeze
ruffles her coat and she sticks her hands in her pockets
Frustrated alone at a complete loss as to what to do what
action to take -- Annie for the first time in frozen
standing still -- and with her comes a rush of emotion

She sits with her back against the monument and begins to
weep For Grace for Robert herself for the tombstones for
everyone

A FLASHLIGHT shines on her face It is a PARK RANGER

PARK RANGER
You okay maam

ANNIE
(wipes face)
Yes Fine

PARK RANGER
That young lady is getting a little
worried

Annie realizes she left Grace alone as it got darker

ANNIE
Im sorry Im sorry

Annie rises and is escorted back to the Suburban by the
Ranger She sees

Grace is sitting in the front seat now waiting for her --
like a little girl lost

INT SUBURBAN - CONTINUOUS

Annie gets into the drivers seat Buckles up Grace holds
back tears

ANNIE
You buckled up
(Grace nods)
You cold

GRACE
Little

Annie reaches into the back seat and pulls a blanket out
handing it to Grace making sure it covers her Grace turns
towards the window and closes her eyes Annie starts the car

EXT MONTANA BACK ROAD - MORNING

CU on Pilgrims head in the trailer as we PULL BACK to
reveal the Suburban coming down an empty seemingly infinite
stretch of two-lane road in Montana

INT SUBURBAN - MORNING

Annie and Grace both in front seats eating doughnuts and
coffee They stop

POV -- Through the windshield is an endless sky and a rolling
sea of land

GRACE
Gee this looks like a fun place

ANNIE
Dont they believe in signs here

GRACE
What would they say Ten miles to big
rock Twenty miles to bigger rock

ANNIE
There was supposed to be a turn off
Did I miss it
GRACE
I didnt see it

Their Suburban is the only vehicle on what seems like miles
of road Annie sighs and puts the Suburban in drive

EXT PETERSONS MOTEL and STABLES RED FORK MONTANA - DAY

The Suburban and the horse trailer pulls into Petersons -- a
collection of motel cottage adjacent to an expanse of land
that includes stable corral a main house and various riding
trails into the mountains

Mr Peterson runs out from the main house to greet Annie as
she gets out of the car

INT SUBURBAN ON ANOTHER MONTANA BACK ROAD - LATER THAT DAY

Annie showered and changed is trying to follow Mr
Petersons directions to Toms ranch -- written on Peterson
motel stationary She is lost once again

ANNIE
(reading)
after left stay on main road until
rise then
(frustrated)
What bloody rise What main road

She stops the Suburban (no longer carrying the trailer)
EXT ANOTHER MONTANA BACK ROAD - CONTINUOUS

From outside the Suburban we see but cannot hear Annie
hitting the steering and cursing in frustration

INT SUBURBAN - CONTINUOUS

Annie panting looks ahead and sees nothing but empty space
above and below -- as if the earth and sky met with nothing in
between

She sighs and starts the car again As she moves forward she
senses an almost indistinguishable rise in the road -- as we
follow her POV up the road through the windshield to reveal

POV -- A BREATHTAKING VALLEY just beyond the rise hidden
from view only a few yards before THE DOUBLE DIVIDE RANCH
sits nestled in the valley a few miles away Annie is
impressed
EXT THE DOUBLE DIVIDE RANGE - DAY

Men are working in the corral saddle horses standing
trying to get a sick calf to suckle a cow One of the

Tom Booker

working along side his brother FRANK and

nephew JOE Frank is a good man -- solid work ethic
Christian fearing wry sense of humor With the build

nearby
men is
his

ofa

football player

his strength never overwhelms his boyish

good-natured heart Joe is eleven wearing his cowboy hat

like a badge of honor

The three men seem as inseparable to

each other

as they are to the land As they work

Tom and Frank dont say anything Just nod

JOE
Can we take a look at Brontys foal
when were done here Dad

FRANK
Sure As long as she dont mind

JOE
Theres a kid at school says we
shouldve imprint-trained him

JOE
He says if you do it soon as theyre
born it makes them real easy to handle
later on

FRANK
Thats what some folks say

JOE

There was this thing on the TV about a
guy who does it with geese He has this
airplane and these baby geese all grow
up thinking its their mom and he flies
it and they just follow

(to Tom)
You hear bout that Uncle T

TOM
Yeah I hear about that

JOE
Well what do you think about that
stuff

TOM
Well Joe Ill tell ya -- I dont know
a whole lot about geese Maybe its okay

knowingly
for them to grow up thinking theyre
airplanes But horses as far as I can
tell cant fly

Frank laughs Joe smirks as Tom messes his hat up Theres the
sound of a car They turn

The Suburban is coming over the ridge heading down the
driveway in a cloud of dust

JOE
We expecting company

Frank shakes his head As the Suburban slows down Tom
recognizes the driver

TOM
I dont believe it

FRANK
You know her

Annie out of her element hiding behind sunglasses gets out
as Tom approaches her by himself Annie girds herself for the
confrontation

ANNIE
Hello Mr Booker Annie MacLean From
New York We talked on the phone

She extends her hand TOM shakes it nodding staring at her
curiously

ANNIE
Its uh beautiful country I had a
little bit of a hard time finding the
place There are no signs

TOM
Plenty of signs -- just none of them
printed Who do I get the idea youre
not just passing through

ANNIE
Well OK here it is Uh Id
like you to take a look at my horse
Now -- it wont take long and if after

that you still dont feel

TOM
Were you thinking of personally driving
me back East
ANNIE
Oh no Shes here I brought him along
And my daughter too Were staying at
Petersons

TOM
You mean you hauled him all the way out
here Just like that

ANNIE
(slightly taken aback)
Well yes I had a trailer Its not

like I made him run along side of the car

TOM
All by yourself

She nods Tom cannot help be impressed by her guts and
fortitude

Camera cuts away for a moment to a window in the ranch house
through which DIANE -- Franks fiery loyal pioneer wife --
looks at the duo with suspicion

TOM
I uh ha ha I dont think I ever
met a lady quite like yourself and I
appreciate all the pains youve gone
through to --

ANNIE

Look Please Dont do the shucks
maam thing again

(Tom surprised listens)
Ive driven a few thousand miles for a
few minutes of your time Ive brought
him here -- to your neck of the

(seeing no woods)
-- mountains Just take a look at him
If you still feel the same way Ill
be on the road by morning and youll
never see me again OK Deal

Tom tries to hide a smile of respect Annie thinking she may
have him starts backing away towards her car -- as one would
a dangerous animal they think they might have tamed

ANNIE
Were at Petersons Whenever youre
free You dont even have to call

She gets into the Suburban Tom watches her drive off
EXT ANNIE AND GRACES COTTAGE - DAY

Tom walks up some wooden steps to a door and knocks He hears
a TV on inside And Graces Voice

GRACE (0S)
MOM The door

He hears Annies muffled reply from 0S He hears some banging
as Grace fumbles for her crutch and comes to the door She
opens it only so far as to reveal her upper body

GRACE
Yeah

TOM
Uh Im Tom Booker Your mother
around

Grace hops to the side as Tom walks by her into the room
Grace is closing the door as he turns to see for the first
time that Grace is one leg

GRACE
Shell be right out Shes on the
phone

Grace hops back to the bed in front of the TV Tom nods and
puts his hat down -- noticing the prosthetic leaning against
the window near her bed He hears Annie on the phone and
looks to the other room the door ajar -- seeing only her
legs seated on the edge of her bed as she talks Her foot
taps impatiently

TOM
First time in Montana

Grace rudely nods still looking at the TV

Beat Tom doesnt like her manner but can easily see through
it He sits

TOM
She gonna be long

GRACE
Probably Shes on the phone twenty-
three hours a day

TOM
What does she do

GRACE
Shes an editor

TOM
Mmm An editor

GRACE
Not like books or literature or anything
Just a magazine Just in case she
hasnt told you -- which Im sure she
hasnt -- I dont want to be a part of
this OK

Tom just sort of nods A beat or two later Annie enters

ANNIE
Sorry about that Hi Grace this is
Mr Booker Have you looked at

Pilgrim

Tom sees Grace turn away just as Annie enters He takes a
moment He could say no right there but something stops him

TOM
Uh no I was gonna take a look now

ANNIE
You want us to come with you I just
have to run to the main house and give
Mr Peterson a check

TOM
Doesnt matter
ANNIE
Grace Grace you want to come with

us take a look at Pilgrim

Grace keeps looking at the TV No reply Tom is half way out
the door when he says to Annie -- making sure Grace can hear --

TOM
Probably best she stays behind anyway

He disappears Annie gives Grace a final look and exits
closing the door

Alone Grace flings her body across the bed reaching for her
prosthetic -- putting it on feverishly She is completely
intrigued by Tom
EXT PETERSONS STABLES - DAY

Tom stands alone at the stable Opening the bottom door
ducking under the stall he goes inside

TOM
Okay now Okay now

Walking towards him Tom raises his hand showing Pilgrim a
sign of respect of trust He quietly makes his way along
Pilgrims side along his flank prompting Pilgrim to move
out from the shadows into the light Tom moves to look at
him And Pilgrim suddenly kicks out at him Tom not cowed
stands his ground He bends looking at Pilgrims withered
legs He looks up at his scarred head He looks into the
pools of the horses tortured eyes Pilgrim stands still --
allowing Tom this brief intimacy

As Grace walks towards the stable she realizes that the door
is open and Tom must be inside She is amazed

Annie appearing behind her is also impressed

Tom exits the stable and sees them as he closes the doors

ANNIE
Well Youre closest anyones
gotten
He walks straight towards them -- veering more to Grace He

stops in front of her and they look into each others eyes --
in a way that reminds us of how Tom looked at Pilgrim

Except Grace is made even more uncomfortable by the intimacy
She turns away and walks to the corral to lean on a post --
as if she doesnt care Tom turns to Annie

TOM
I have to be honest I still feel
you made a long trip for nothing

He looks at Annie Annie has no more words -- just an ever-
present pleading in her face

Tom watches as Grace makes a small naked movement -- putting
her hand on her cheek like a hurt child

He cant help but see these three being connected by one wound

TOM
But before I even think about it I
need to know something here and now
Its a question for Grace here

Grace stiffens

TOM
When I work with a horse its no good
just me doing it It doesnt work that
way The owner needs to be involved too

ANNIE
Well thatll be a little complicated --

TOM

You can make it as complicated or as
easy as you like But shes the one
whos gonna be riding him am I right
So heres the deal Im not sure I can
do anything but Im prepared to give
it a go --

(to Grace)
-- if youll help

(Grace gives a bitter laugh)
You have a problem with that

GRACE
Isnt it like obvious

TOM
Not to me Either you want to or you
dont

ANNIE
Look Ill talk to Grace and call you
later--

TOM

Excuse me with all due respect but
this is her decision not yours And I
dont want to waste anybodys time --
mostly mine

Grace reacts anew to Toms remark She likes her mother being
dis-empowered Annie keenly understands the importance of Tom
putting it this way to Grace Grace has all eyes on her --
just what she wants All waiting for her response She turns
away flicks her head and says

GRACE
Well theres nothing else to do around
here
Annie smiles in relief But Tom isnt satisfied

TOM
Not good enough I cant help you

He starts walking away Annie doesnt know what to do Grace
mumbles

GRACE
What do I have to do

Tom keeps walking out Grace says it louder

GRACE
I said what do I have to do

Tom stops and looks at her Annie holds her breath
INT THE RANCH HOUSE DOUBLE DIVIDE - NIGHT

Frank Tom Joe and TOM TWIN BOYS 6 years old sit at a dining
table eating dinner as Diane serves We parachute into the
middle of the conversation

DIANE
well I just think shes got a lot

of nerve showing up here Draggin that
child and that poor animal all the way

(TO ONE OF THE TWINS)
You eat with those fingers again and you

Frank dont you think shes got a nerve

FRANK
Oh hell I dont know According to Tom

TOM

DIANE
What they aint going forty miles into

Choteau everytime they want a hamburger

FRANK

DIANE

FRANK

(slyly)
I believe women from New York eat mixed
salads Aint that right Tom

Tom hides a grin -- he knows Frank into teasing her now
TOM

I believe so Saw it on a television
show once

DIANE
Well thats just what we need on a cattle
ranch -- a vegetarian from New York
Everyone eats Beat
JOE

When you figure on branding

FRANK

TOM

Frank nods Silence again Everyone eats Beat

JOE
Whats an editor do anyway

DIANE
(playing)
Were not sure sweetheart but they
eat like rabbits

Tom and Frank chuckle Diane smiles -- in on the joke with
them The children are curiously confused

INT ANNIE AND GRACES MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Camera moves to reveal Annie on the phone in front of her
computer and fax plugging in extension cords as she talks

ANNIE
the phone companys putting in extra
lines Ill call back with the numbers
Oh and I want you to get in touch with
this lady in town here -- they say shes
sort of a physical therapist for the

rodeo boys but keep the one at the
hospital we already contacted on call

Grace sits alone in the living room Watching TV but anxious
and disturbed about what shes committed herself to

INT DOUBLE DIVIDE KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

Diane is in her bathrobe doing bills at the kitchen table as
she listens to a BOOK OF TAPE Her hand on her forehead her
other hand writing Tom enters to take his hat off the
sideboard He moves to the table and reaches over for a

cookie from a plate of cookies Without looking up Diane
slaps his hand Tom then pours himself a cup of coffee then
swiftly sneaks his hand back and grabs a cookie Diane smiles
Tom exits

It is only then that Diane looks up after him
INT UPPER FLOOR OF RANCH HOUSE - NIGHT

Camera follows Tom towards his bedroom -- passing the others
Perhaps we see Frank sprawled out asleep already in his
underwear We might see the Twins in their bunks One of the
Twins lower torso is laying outside of the blanket He
casually flips the blanket over the kids bare feet and
continues to his room

INT TOMS BEDROOM - NIGHT

Tom enters and closes the door Turns on a stereo which plays
a cello piece by Yo-Yo Ma Books fills his room He sits at
his desk puts on eye glasses and looks through some paperwork
Suddenly he stops looking over the paperwork into space A
thought passes by We dont know what

FADE OUT
EXT THE RANCH A CORRAL - DAYBREAK
First light of day Pilgrim stands stock still in the middle
of the corral Tom motionless is crouched on his haunches

in the corral -- watching him

TOMS POV As Pilgrim moves he can see that the horse is
stove up

He softly tosses a handful of dirt at Pilgrims withered
legs Pilgrim sensitive to the slightest provocation
bucks wheeling away from him Then stops Tom sits on his
haunches again and watches him

Frank appears exiting from the barn (perhaps)

FRANK
Tom
TOM
Yeah
Tom leaves Pilgrim hooking up with Frank -- the two brothers

go off discussing the ranch work that is ahead of them
DISSOLVE TO

EXT THE RANCH - ANOTHER DAY

Annie and Grace arrive in the Suburban They exit As they
head towards the ranch they see in the distance

Pilgrim standing along the fence of a round pen Tom stands
in the pen holding a rope looking at Pilgrim

EXT THE ROUND PEN - DAY

Tom stands in the pen with Pilgrim He looks to see Annie and
Grace approaching but makes no acknowledgement He turns his
focus back to Pilgrim

Annie and Grace appear Grace takes a position (that is to
become her regular spot) a distance away from the pen Annie
moves in closer beside SMOKEY (a ranch hand) with one leg
up on the pen fence

SMOKEY
Howdy
(sees Grace)
Howdy
He and Annie watch as Tom stands before Pilgrim -- turning
sideways then standing
ANNIE
Whats he doing
SMOKEY

Trying to get his eye

ANNIE
Hows it going
Smokey doesnt respond -- how its going is exactly how it
looks Tom takes a few steps stops and stands still again We
sense the process is long and requires great patience

DISSOLVE TO
EXT ROUND PEN - DAY

Two hours later Grace is in the same spot Smokey is gone
doing his work Annie has taken a different position looking
over SEVERAL PAGES OF FAXES on her lap

Tom is still standing in the pen trying to get Pilgrims eyes
Joe has joined the proceedings sitting on the pen rail

Tom deftly throws a hoolihan gently lassoing Pilgrim around
the neck And Pilgrim at the touch of the rope crazed
resists pulling back striking at the rope The rope
cutting into Toms hands Tom gives him some slack giving
his head letting him relax then gently heads him by the
rope walking him around the pen getting his feet to moving

Graces eyes never leave Tom
DISSOLVE TO
EXT DOUBLE DIVIDE - DAY

Tom off in the distance -- against a sky that seems to be
touching the land -- is riding along a creek Closer up we
see hes rustling the bushes with a stick Some stray cows
run out of the bushes Tom races after them His horse
shepherds the cow across the creek and up a hillside

At the top of the hill with the ranch spread out endlessly
before him Tom sees Frank on his horse chasing strays Tom
whistles Frank waves back In the near distance a pickup
truck is parked on the range

Joe and the TWINS are throwing food pellets out of the back
of the truck Cattle come from across the range for the food
What begins as a handful of cows becomes dozens then
hundreds -- the truck virtually disappearing among them

Tom stops for a moment to look out at his ranch Far off in
the distance he sees Annies Suburban coming along the road
to the ranch He watches as Annies distant figure gets out
of the car with Grace Annie instinctively turns and looks
across the land Even though there is such a distance
theres a sense Tom and Annie are looking at each other
Tom senses Joe driving Franks truck slowly moving off the
range -- the Twins in the back the cattle following Tom sits
on his horse atop the hill

EXT THE DOUBLE DIVIDE - ANOTHER DAY

Pilgrim his scarred head above water legs moving in odd
sycopation swimming We discover he is in a pond tethered
to a pole Except for the sound of his legs in the water
everything is quiet and focused on Pilgrim

SMOKEY holds the pole walking on the outside of the pond
leading Pilgrim back and forth as he swims Tom crouched by
the pond silently concentrating on Pilgrim

Grace watches off by herself Annie stands beside Joe She
cant help but be intrigued by the sight She asks Joe

ANNIE
I though horses were afraid of
water

Joe doesnt answer her Grace likes that Annie frustrated
feels she has the right to simple shout out to Tom

ANNIE
Is that to get his strength back

Tom pays her no mind -- concentrating on Pilgrim

Suddenly Annies CELL PHONE rings jarring the proceedings
Tom turns to Annie She hides her embarrassment by answering
it walking away Tom gives her a look Grace is loving this
Tom turns back to Pilgrim After a few moments --

Tom taking the rope tether unhooks it from the pole He
starts to lead Pilgrim out of the water Pilgrim fearful
fights him He rears splashing Tom not wanting to come out
of the water Grace is worried She looks to Joe and sees he
is concerned too though he stands quietly

Annie hears the commotion from where she stands and finishes
her call to return to the pond

Tom enters the pond waist deep in water trying to grab
Pilgrims rope Pilgrim rises up rearing at him Joe and
Smokey sensing danger come closer to the pond Annie
appears beside Grace and watches as Tom reaches for the rope
again Pilgrim rears again Tom stumbles backwards from his
hooves Annie gasps Grace turns to walk away from the pond
She cant watch -- it brings back too much But as she does
she is stopped by the sight of --
Tom righting himself unphased calmly walks back to Pilgrim
The horse baffled by this mans lack of fear lets him take
the rope and walk him out of the pond

Grace cant help but be impressed Joe nods Annie is shaken

ANNIE
Mr Booker Im not at all comfortable
with you taking those kinds of chances

As Tom leads Pilgrim out the horse suddenly whirls bolting
knocking Tom down

ANNIE
Oh God

Pilgrim runs off pulling the wet rope behind him Joe runs
over and grabs for the rope

TOM
NO LET HIM GO

Joe obeys Pilgrim runs past the corral and down into a hill
out onto a pasture He keeps on running into the distance --
running across the pasture not knowing where he is going

Tom arms folded across his chest watches him run A
concerned Annie approaches

ANNIE
Shes running away How are you going
to get him back

Tom doesnt respond He walks off down the hill out onto the
pasture stops arms folded and watches Pilgrim Annie turns
when she hears Smokey who appears behind her

SMOKEY

He dont really want to run Dont
know where hes going All this open
space scares the daylight out of him

Confused Pilgrim stops running and walks in no particular
direction

SMOKEY
My guess is hes spent his life ina
six-by-eight stall Hes forgot what

its like to be a horse

Smokey ambles off and she turns back to see Tom crouching on
his haunches sitting in the grass just waiting Pilgrim
walks back towards the ranch stops a distance from Tom
looks at him Annie needing to know exactly whats going
on crosses down the hill to him

ANNIE
So what now Should we leave

Tom continues watching Pilgrim Annie looks at him sitting
there motionless and feels like an idiot Clearly she doesnt
understand all this and clearly no one thinks this is the
time to explain to her

ANNIE
Well were going to go then

Without looking at her Tom just nods Annie awkwardly
walks back up the hill to where Grace is

ON THE GRASSY HILLSIDE Grace is watching the scene by herself

as Joe appears staring at her leg It makes her
uncomfortable

She turns to him with a curt impatient tone

GRACE
What

Their eyes meet Joe is so guileless Grace is taken off guard
when he asks in such a compassionate voice

JOE
Does that hurt you

Grace tries to think of an answer -- and of how to say it

GRACE
Only when I kick somebody

Her gentle delivery makes him smile She smiles then

GRACE
Dont you go to school

JOE
Twice a month they give you a day off
to work on the ranch

He tips his hat down as he looks out to Pilgrim with respect
JOE

Look at him out in the pasture -- Yeah
he mustve been a big beautiful looking
horse How was he to ride

Grace is uncomfortable again She looks away just struggling
Joe senses shes done talking

JOE
Excuse me I got chores to look after

He tips his hat and walks off passing Annie as she arrives

ANNIE
You ready to go

Grace hesitates Then mother and daughter take one more look --

POV -- Pilgrim standing in the pasture with Tom crouching in
the grass waiting for him

DISSOLVE TO
EXT PASTURE - LATER THAT DAY

Tom is still sitting in the grass just where we left him --
waiting patiently Pilgrim is still out in the pasture

DISSOLVE TO
EXT PASTURE - STILL LATER THAT DAY
Afternoon shadows cross the ranch Tom is in the exact same
spot and position Pilgrim is somewhat closer -- but still at

a distance -- watching him

Frank rides back from work As he passes Tom the two nod as
if nothing usually is going on Frank rides up to the barn

INT PETERSONS MOTEL -

Grace is flicking the television -- repeating the only three
channels over and over

Annie works at her computer surrounded by work She notices
the time gets a thought and dials the phone

ANNIE
Hello Mr Booker Oh hello Frank
This is Annie MacLean I was
wondering has-
(listens)
Uh-huh And Pilgrim
(listens)

Still Uh-huh
is

(politely cheery)
Okay then Thank you

She hangs up pauses then speaks to the window out loud enough
for Grace to hear --

ANNIE
Hes still sitting in that damn
field

GRACE

(wo looking at her)
I think they call it a pasture

Annie looks at her as if to say the last thing I need to know
a lesson on the local lingo

ANNIE
Lets go see whats going on then
get something to eat

EXT DOUBLE DIVIDE RANCH - DUSK

The sky is changing colors the temperature has dropped Tom
is still sitting in the grass although someone has brought
him a blanket for his shoulders Pilgrim is in the pasture
but now -- he too is motionless looking back at Tom

The sound of a car makes Tom turn to see Annie driving up
She gets out stands by the car with a proprietary air
watching Tom and Pilgrim Grace remains in the car Theres a
sound She turns to see Diane coming out of the house

DIANE
Theres coffee inside I was just
bringing this to Tom

ANNIE
Would you mind if I did Id like to
talk to him

Diane knowing full well Tom aint in a talking mood hands
her a cup

DIANE
Sure
(seeing Grace in car)
Does your daughter want to come
inside

ANNIE
Uh no were going to dinner Is
this the way to the pasture

DIANE
Pasture Oh that stretch of field near
the hill Yeah

Shes gone Annie grimaces then crosses the hillside to
where Tom is squatting down She appears to his side and
without speaking tries to indicates she has his coffee by
leaning it toward him Tom sees her and accepts it with a
grateful nod Annie waits Nothing happens Feeling foolish
she begins to walk back

At some point she turns to see Pilgrim moving across the
pasture toward Tom He stops in front of him just a few feet
away Tom says something to him Annie is intrigued -- and she
knows enough to stay quiet now She watches Pilgrim walk over
to him She watches as Tom gets up and pats Pilgrims scarred
head In spite of herself Annie is somewhat moved by this act

Only we see Grace peering out from the car seeing this act
of communion as well Only we see her reaction to it

As Tom turns and walks back to the ranch Pilgrim follows him
As he passes Annie all he says is

TOM
From now on leave your phone
somewhere else

As he moves past her Annie responds

ANNIE
But I have business calls I have
to --

Tom keeps heading for the barn as he suggests without turning
back

TOM
Then drop off Grace in the morning
go on back and do your business
Come pick her up around dinner

Standing there Annie has the impulse to respond to this
suggestion but has no idea what to say and saying it wouldnt
make much sense since Tom is already out of ear shot

Diane appears from the house and calls out

DIANE
relief

Mrs MacLean -- why dont you and
daughter stay for dinner

ANNIE
Oh uh thank you No we dont want to
impose

DIANE

No imposition Plenty of food Gonna
get pretty dark soon Hard to find a
place

Annie looks up to the alien sky and realizes shes right She
looks to Grace who doesnt seem to oppose the idea

INT RANCH HOUSEKITCHEN - NIGHT

Everyone sits around the kitchen table Joe still wearing
his hat eyes Annie and Grace with acute curiosity

DIANE
Joe take off the hat -- Im not
going to say it again

Joe obeys Diane puts the last of the serving plates on the
table -- pork chops potatoes gravy peas bread And a big
bowl of mixed salad The boy cant help eyeing how the
vegetarians will act

Annie and Grace eye the food Annie reaches out for a serving
ladle picking up Graces plate to serve her as Grace reaches
for a piece of bread when

FRANK
Dear Lord we are humbly thankful
for
Annie and Grace freeze as Frank continues his prayer -- they

notice everyones head bowed slightly

FRANK
(continues)
these gifts For the blessings on our
home our family and our guests Bless
those that arent as fortunate Bless
all Gods creatures

EVERYONE
Amen

Everyone begins eating Annie and Grace breath a sigh of
Silence Utensils hitting plates the only sound

FRANK
Bank out us a couple more men to run
the cattle

TOM

We should be fine then
Beat Annie and Grace listen

JOE
Teacher asked me why we raise Black
Angus-Herefords stead of Pure Herefords

FRANK
Tell her they suit the weather better
Their udders are black stead of pink

TOM
They dont get burned by the sun bouncing
off the snow And theyre good mother

FRANK
Our daddy raised Pure Herefords

Silence Eating Annie tries her hand at conversation

ANNIE

You know thats interesting I always
wondered when I went into a restaurant
what was the difference between a regular
steak or a Black Angus steak I couldnt
taste any difference although I could
swear one was more tender I didnt know
there was that big a difference between
COWS

(silence)
Ive never been on a cow farm before I
must say the bulls seem to have the
best time of it Just laying around the
fields all day until theyre asked to

(uncomfortable)
do their work

FRANK
Well get born a bull got a ninety
percent chance of getting castrated and
served up as hamburger On a balance I
reckon Id choose being a cow
(to Grace)
Would you mind passing that salad
young lady

DIANE
Hows Petersons holding up for you

ANNIE
(lying)
Its fine Comfortable I still cant
get used to how dark it gets around here
though When we leave the ranch I
always hold my breath until I can see
the motel

FRANK
(innocently)
You know Tom while youre working on
that horse of theirs Annie and Grace
should move into the old Creek house

Diane and Tom react accordingly Diane hiding her annoyance
Tom hiding his surprise and pleasure

FRANK
Nobodys using it Silly for her to be
driving back and forth when she dont
know her way around that well

ANNIE
Oh I dont know

FRANK
Well I know Petersons Old place is as
good as falling down around your ears

DIANE
(overlapping)
Theyre already all settled in Frank
Anyway Im sure Annie wants her privacy

FRANK
Its got doors Diane Private as can be
Tom

TOM
I dont have a problem with that Its up
to Annie

ANNIE

Well its worth it really I mean how
much longer do you think you need to work
with Pilgrim
TOM
Thats up to Pilgrim

Everyone waits on Annies answer as she considers this

INT MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Grace is on the phone with Robert Annie is packing things
up Grace is telling him about the day

GRACE
(listens)

Annie reacts to this

GRACE

ANNIE

(takes the phone)
Hi

INTERCUT
INT CENTRAL PARK WEST APARTMENT - NIGHT

Robert is burning the midnight oil in the study with files
all around him

ROBERT
Hey She sounds like shes doing
all right How is she

Grace exits into the bathroom Annie talks softly

ANNIE

(cautious)
Yeah She seems to be getting more
comfortable on the ranch which is why
I said yes to this move But whenever

Anyway whats happening with the
Delco lawsuit

ROBERT
Robert

Awkwardly they hang up Grace exits the bathroom

GRACE

But

ANNIE
You already did

GRACE
Did he mention it

ANNIE
(resumes packing)
Yeah hes going to think about it
You want me to pack for you

Grace looks at her disapprovingly as she passes to go to the
bathroom Annie registers this

INT RANCH HOUSE - LATE DAY

Diane is washing windows while listening to an audio book on
her tape player Through the windows she sees

Joe and the Twins helping Annie and Grace move into the Creek
House

Diane has conflicting feelings about this She continues her
work

INT CREEK HOUSE - LATE DAY

VARIOUS SHOTS of ANNIE CONNECTING HERSELF BACK TO THE REST OF
THE WORLD BY PLUGGING IN HER COMPUTER FAX ETC

Grace is in the other room as she was in the motel Alone
With no television she is just listening to her music laying
on the couch The two women remain separate no matter where
they are

But we see a small difference Grace rises and walks to the
window She looks out

POV She sees people working about the ranch Maybe Joe is
among them -- riding his horse as he works Or maybe its
just a vision of people with tasks to complete -- who do so
with pride discipline and clarity

Grace looks out the window longingly
EXT THE RANCH - ANOTHER DAY
A cloud of dust A dozen or so horses are running in an arena

by the stables Tom is riding among them holding a long stick
with an orange flag at the end of it waving it at the young
horses making them run away from him The colts stay close
together One of the horses PILGRIM stays at a distance off
to himself

Grace watches from along the railing She alternates her
attention from the horses to Tom

TOM
What were doing here Grace is
trying to get him to learn how to
be a horse again

He cracks the flag the horses move together

TOM
The others already know see Thats
how they are in the wild -- herd

animals

(cracks the flag)
When theyve got a problem like
they have now with me and this flag
they look to each other But old
Pilgrim there has forgotten Im the
rock and theyre the hard place He
thinks he hasnt got a friend in the
whole wild world

CU on GRACE who clearly feels the same way but wants
desperately not to She watches him ride off towards Pilgrim
who has stopped like all the others at the far end of the
ring He stands by himself tossing his head snorting not
wanting to be around other horses Tom cracks the flag
keeping them moving Pilgrim does his own private dance

Tom rides by Grace and hands her the stick

TOM
Hold this for a minute

Grace stiffens She doesnt want to but shes afraid to say
No to Tom He just insists by tossing it to her

TOM
Hold onto it go on

Shes forced to catch it He turns and rides away chasing
down Pilgrim trying to edge him toward the herd For a
moment he has him breaking to the left with the horses But
as soon as hes clear of Tom he separates himself and comes
to stop on his own

Tom rides back to Grace taking back the flag
TOM
Well get there Grace

As he says this he flashes a small reassuring smile and a
little wink Grace melts just a little As he rides away

Annie appears having come from the Creek House She calls

ANNIE
Grace The clinic just called
They had to change your physical
therapy appointment We have to
leave now

Grace frowns a little -- her mothers perfect timing Annie
approaches the arena watching Tom riding As he passes her

TOM
Hello Annie

Annie notices how he says her name

ANNIE
Mr Booker

He flashes a smile in her direction and Annies expression
comically matches her daughters reaction She quickly covers
it however Her eyes follow him as he glides around the
arena Its like watching a great ballet -- his control of the
horses his effortlessness his grace his strength She
smiles to herself in appreciation Then catches herself

ANNIE

(to Grace)
You got everything you need

GRACE
If I had everything I need I wouldnt
be going to physical therapy

Tom approaches as he overhears Grace respond

ANNIE
(trying to cheer her)
Honey come on Would you like to stay
in town for dinner Maybe see what
movies playing tonight

GRACE
Why Theres no food in the house
ANNIE
No I just thought forget it

Hes getting a clearer view of their relationship

TOM
You know were branding here
tomorrow If you two want to come
by to watch or give a hand youre

welcome
ANNIE
(laughs)
Branding
(sarcastic)

I havent branded in years
Tom chuckles

GRACE
Ill come

ANNIE
Uh I dont honey Branding Oooh
I think wed just be in Mr Bookers
way

TOM
As long as you dont get in the way of
the branding iron it doesnt matter too
much

Annie smiles She turns to Grace questioningly

matter-of-factly to prove her point

GRACE
I watched Margo Neuberger get a
tattoo

Tom squints Annie shrugs and nods

ANNIE
Okay

As Grace and Annie walk to the car Tom says

TOM
Hey Grace -- maybe we can get your
mom to put me and you branding on the
cover of her magazine Start a whole
new fashion craze

Grace says
They continue walking as Grace smiles enjoying being singled
out for his joke Annie responds almost flirtatiously

ANNIE
Try not to fall off your high horse
Mr Booker

Tom tips his hat and rides away Annie smiles and nods
Grace doesnt like their sudden familiarity Or her mothers
coy manner As they enter the Suburban Grace asks point blank

GRACE
Did you call Dad today

Annie is caught off guard

Tom riding in the arena catches himself looking after them
then goes riding after Pilgrim

EXT DOUBLE DIVIDE - DAY

The air smells of scorched flesh There is nothing but NOISE
Calves separated from their mothers cry They are moved
out through a series of connected pens into a narrow chute
and then one by one into a holding pen Theyre clamped and
lowered sideways onto a table and given a shot a yellow
insect tag in one ear branded then sent back to their
mothers The bulls in a pen by themselves stand haughty
paying no attention Frank helps doctor the calves Joe
brands

Annie and Grace are standing by the railing watching with a
mixture of fascination and disgust

Tom moves in the feeder pen waist deep in calves moving them
through the chute He looks to Annie

TOM
Hey over there you want to make
yourself useful

It isnt a question

TOM
Hank I got you a volunteer

Annie and Grace realize they have no choice
-- WHAT FOLLOWS IS A SEQUENCE OF SCENES SHOWING ANNIE AND

GRACE PARTICIPATING IN THE BRANDING AND HOW THEY GRADUALLY
COME TO LOSE THEMSELVES IN THE EXPERIENCE
SEQUENCES WILL INCLUDE

-- HANK A RANCH HEAD HELPING ANNIE INTO THE CHUTE ANNIE
GETTING KICKED BY A CALF

-- GRACE BEING SHOWN HOW TO HOLD THE BRANDING IRON
-- HANK TEACHING ANNIE HOW TO SAY HYAH

-- TOM IN THE HOLDING PEN WITH HIS ARMS AROUND GRACE SHOWING
HER HOW TO APPLY THE BRAND GRACE A LITTLE FRIGHTENED OF THE
BRAND IS IN HEAVEN IN TOMS ARMS

-- ANNIE IS STILL TRYING TO SAY HYAH WITH THE PROPER FORCE
SHE CLAPS HER HANDS PUSHING THE CALVES ALONG KNEE DEEP IN
COW SHIT

-- GRACE CLOSES HER EYES AND THE IRON TOUCHES THE CALFS HIDE

TOM
Thats good firm but gentle
(Grace opens her eyes)
It hurts but hell get over it

Grace smiles proudly

TOM
You handled that pretty well Think
its time you earn your keep around
here So when were not working
and when you dont have your therapy
Id like you to help out with the
horses Rubbing them cleaning up
the stalls You think you can
handle that

Grace knows him well enough to know

GRACE
Thats not a question is it

TOM
Youre catching on

Grace smiles

-- Annie turns and not looking where shes doing trips over
a calf falling down And calves coming down the chute
start to run towards her Suddenly Tom grabs her by the leg
and pulls her to safety He helps her up and dusts her off

TOM
(not wanting to smile
but)
You okay

ANNIE
It is cocktail hour yet

Tom laughs She takes a big breath
EXT THE RANCH - LATE AFTERNOON
The ranch is colored in amber light

Near the house two long tables pushed together to make one
long one A gentle breeze ruffles the tablecloth Everyone
is seated for a meal We hear laughter and conversation We
parachute into the middle of the moments

-- Hank helping with his wife get to their three children to
sit still for dinner

-- Diane organizing the women and their various plates of side
dishes

-- The Ranch Hand piling up their plates and kidding each
other

-- Joe is instructing Grace on the various sauces for the
ribs The Twins are making fun of him behind his back

-- Tom and Smokey are barbecuing the last one to sit

-- Frank assists his frail mother ELLEN BOOKER at the table
filling her plate with all the things she cant reach for

DISSOLVE TO

The faces are beautiful Laughing Eating Everyone is tanned
and exhausted after a long day but filled with life and
eager to live it The tables are covered with heavy food

The communion at this table is as much a part of the ritual
as the branding itself

Annie and Grace look different to us Tanned from the sun
their bodies sore -- they feel softened yet more vital As if
the artifice had been worn off the armor of urban life As
the table thrives with conversations we focus on

Annie and Ellen Booker Annie looks calmer than weve seen
her -- and more naturally beautiful She is seated beside
Ellen Booker We sense they have been talking for a while
Annie is so sincerely interested in listening to her shes
hardly touched her own plate

ELLEN BOOKER
he was a blacksmith by trade my
father My grandson Joe was named
for him But he always dreamed of
having his own place and raising
horses

We see Tom a few places down and across from Annie and his
mother -- but fully aware of their conversation

ELLEN BOOKER
Hed heard of some land Whats
Stockett now Rode out there Got off
his horse and walked about as far as
he could in one way Then he walked as
far as he could another way and
another until he got back to where he
started and thats where he put his

roots down Thats where my husband
and I ranched and raised Frank and
Tommy

She motions proudly to Tom who looks up Annie smiles to him
He looks to her with gratitude for the respect shes showing
his mother

ELLEN BOOKER
Quite a different life from what you
know I expect Which place to you
call home

ANNIE
Well I was born in London but my
father was an ambassador and we
moved constantly Ive lived in a lot
of places but I dont really know what
Id call home

Tom listens to this

ELLEN BOOKER
An ambassador My Thats very
important

ANNIE
He was a wonderful man

She looks to Tom and he can sense a sadness around this in her
eyes
DIANE
(to Grace)
I sure hope youre gonna eat more
than that young lady Youre a
growing girl

GRACE
Ive never eaten this much in my
life

DIANE
Probably never worked so hard
neither Those arms of yours are
gonna be pretty sore tomorrow Ill
give you a little bit of ointment I
make Its a magic recipe my Mama
gave me

FRANK
We used to call Dianes mother
Medicine Woman None of us never went
to the doctor when she was alive

Annie and Grace listen in

HANK
Too bad she wasnt here for old
Henry Vanoker

FRANK
Not much would have helped him

DIANE
I never got that whole story what
happened

HANK
Old Henry was changing a flat tire on
his truck over on 118 when that
(laughs)
two-hundred-year-old jack he has

gives way and the side of that truck
come slamming down on that rock he
calls head

Theres laughter -- everyone knows Old Henry

ANNIE
What happened

HANK
Knocked him out for a while He woke

Except
up finished putting on the tire and
drove himself to the hospital

DIANE
Old Fool Darling pass down those peas
for me thank you

Annie and Grace dont know how to respond But everyone else
takes it their stride as they continue eating

Grace notices Joe is whispering something to Frank who nods
his head and speaks to the table

FRANK
Huh Joe here has something to say

Joe stands somewhat formally with his hat on

JOE
I wrote this for you Grandma

Mrs Booker and Diane beam Annie and Grace dont know what
to expect Joe stands straight as an arrow and recites a poem
from memory

At first Annie and Grace appear to be embarrassed for the boy
but soon they cant help but be won over by his guilessness
He finishes and everyone applauds Hanks wife asks

HANKS WIFE
That was lovely Who wrote that
Joe

JOE
I wrote it myself maam

FRANK
Now son you tell em when it came
from

JOE

Be honest I cant say I did it all
myself My grandma helped me get the
words right

0000s and aahs and smiles and conversations erupting over
each other

Only we see Grace looking over to Joe who gives her kickass
shy grin

TOM
(raising his beer)
Well Id like to welcome Annie and
Grace to their first branding

FRANK
And next time Miss Annie you can run
down the calves

ANNIE
Ill drink to that

Everyone toasts and drinks Annie and Tom exchange a look

She smiles but not in a alluring way -- rather in a grateful
way Grateful for this brief moment of community and good
feeling And somehow Tom knows what shes feeling

No one notices this silent exchange -- except for Diane who
sees everything thats going on

INT RANCH HOUSE DINING ROOM - NIGHTFALL

The Women are bringing in dishes and plates and food from the
tables through the house and into the kitchen Annie is among
them feeling apart of the group She enters carrying a large
bowl that held the corn

Diane is replacing newly-cleaned forks and knives in her
dining room drawers above which are several FAMILY PICTURES

ANNIE
(referring to clean bowl)
Where does this go Diane

DIANE
Oh you can just set up on the dining
table I have to rearrange my shelves
tomorrow

Annie complies She notices the framed pictures on the wall in
the dining room

ANNIE
Is this Mr Booker Toms
grandfather

Diane looks at a faded photo circa late 1800s

DIANE
Mm-mm I never knew him He died
before Frank and I met This heres
(another photo)
Frank and Toms mother and father
theres little Frank and Tom

ANNIE
She calls him Tommy

DIANE
Always did I think she favored him a
little You tend to when you have more
than one even though you love em all
the same

She studies the old faces of Toms Parents -- although 20th
Century people there is still a pioneering strength in their
visage a stoicism and power

DIANE

(putting away forks)
Ha she loves telling this story about
how when he was two years old he ran off
They found him in the barn sleeping
between two giant hooves of a Percheron
stallion She said that horse was
protecting him and nobody could convince
her otherwise

ANNIE
I got a little confused though The ranch
Ellen was talking about -- thats not this

one
Diane is sorting silverware throughout the following

DIANE
No See Frank and Tom were raised near
the Clarks Fork River right between the
Pryor and Beartooth Mountains Beautiful
piece of land But they had this uncle
Ned -- useless man never interested in
ranching And when the grandparents died
he left for the city and sent word

through lawyers
the land so he

he wanted his claim to

of legation bro
it all in stride
land I dont t
His home being sold out from
Seeing his father like that
Frank got their folks set up
place Tom left went off
him for years

but Tom

e their father

could sell it Three years
Frank took
Tom loved that

hink he ever got over it --

under him
Once he and
in a new

We didnt see

Annie is intrigued by what shes learning about Tom
two

Something outside the window catches her eyes She watches
POV

Tom and Frank on either side to Ellen are escorting her to
a car that will drive her home

EXT RANCH HOUSE - NIGHT
Annie wanders out passing Grace and Joe on her way out The
are sitting in a glider As Annie exits 0OC we hear them

GRACE
Why do you always wear that hat

JOE
Because it fits my head You want to
try it on

Grace doesnt know if she should

Annie continues towards Tom whos sitting in a rocker playing
with the twins

TWINS
Show us again Come on One more time
Its my turn now

TOM
All right al right Hold out your
finger

Annie takes a seat nearby and watches as Tom holds out the
first finger of his right hand The Twins holds out his Tom
splits his focus between Annie and the Twins as he takes a
small piece of rope out of his back pocket He ties the ends
together making a loop He puts the loop over the Twins
finger And holding the other end of the loop taut with his
left hand he draws one side of the cord over the other with
the middle finger of his right hand Then he rolls his hand
over so its under the loop and back over it again so that
his finger is tip to tip with the Twins The loop seemingly
knotted around their touching fingertips and can only be
removed if their touch is broken

TOM
The loops knotted right
(Twins nod)
Looks like the only way to take it
off is if we break our touch
(they nod)
Watch now

Annie and the Twins look down at the touching fingers as Tom
gently pulls the rope away revealing they are still knotted
and without even breaking their touch

TWINS
Again Again One more time

TOM
Oh no No no I only fall for that
once Go inside now before your mother
starts hunting you down Go on

The Twins exit Annie and Tom make eye contact

TOM
(smiles relaxes back)
So how was your first and last day of
branding

ANNIE
Dont be so sure its my last There
are a few people back home Id like
to put under a red hot iron

Tom looks at her with a sly expression and notices shes
shivering

TOM
You got too much sun today
Here

He takes his jacket and puts it around her shoulders

ANNIE
Thank you

He sits back down Annie crosses her arms over her chest
looks around unconsciously swinging her foot Tom watches
her leg Annie notices him watching

ANNIE
What

TOM
You ever just stand still fora
minute

ANNIE

You stand still too long in New York
you get hit by a bicycle messenger
(smiles wryly)
You know sometimes I get the feeling
Mr Booker that youre laughing at me
Why is that

Tom shrugs Annie waits a beat then

ANNIE

Thats your cue to say youre not
laughing at me

TOM
Oh I see you write both sides of the
conversation

ANNIE

Its a mans world Mr Booker Most
women have to

TOM
Well maybe I am laughing a bit I
just thought as long as youre here
it would be nice for you to relax into
the place a little

ANNIE
(understanding)
Well Its beautiful country Ill give
you that And I could see having some
kind of vacation place Retreat But I
dont know how you do it full time Dont
you miss the rest of the world

TOM
Whats that to miss

ANNIE
Ha if youve never lived in a city
with museums theater music restaurants
uh god a million things then its

something I cant explain

TOM
(thinks teasing a bit)
Does Chicago count

ANNIE
(surprised)
You lived in Chicago

TOM
When I was first married
ANNIE
(stunned)
You were married to a woman in
Chicago

Tom likes disturbing her picture of him as the predictable
cowboy He smiles

TOM
I once heard Itzhak Perlman guest star
with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra
He played Rachmaninovs Vocalize Opus 34
No 14 It was one of the most beautiful
pieces of music I ever heard I actually
forgot where I was for a time

(Annie is floored)

You seem surprised

ANNIE
(not wanting to insult)
Well I uh you didnt
TOM

Just whos been laughing at who here
Tom says this with a wry smile Annie returns with a smile --
as an understanding is reached between them theyve both
stereotyped the other They are both pleased -- and attracted -
by what they dont know
INT CREEK HOUSE - NIGHT

Grace is fast asleep exhausted She does not stir when the
phone rings

Annie picks up from her own bed awakened still dressed in
her branding clothes having just passed out on the bed

ANNIE
Hello

INT CENTRAL PARK WENT APARTMENT - NIGHT
INTERCUT Robert alone in the vast apartment
ROBERT
I thought you guys were going to call

me

ANNIE
Oh Robert Im sorry We were so tired
from the branding Grace barely made it
to her bed and I didnt have the energy
to take my clothes off

ROBERT
Oh well branding will do that to you

ANNIE
Everything all right

ROBERT
Huh-huh You

ANNIE

Fine Actually today was a good day
You should have seen her

ROBERT
I wish I did

The sound of self-pity was so obvious for both of them so
Robert quickly re-groups resorting to something he knows is
important to her

ROBERT
Well uh the real reason I called
actually was to tell you I saw Lucy
at Jo-Jos tonight and she seems very
worried

ANNIE
About what

ROBERT
Apparently Gottschalks been seen around
town lunching with some very prominent
magazine editors Lucy said she tried to
call you but no one answered so she faxed
you the list of names She said one of
them have contracts up fairly soon

ANNIE
Oh I didnt look at my faxes today We
left before sunrise

ROBERT

Honey I hope youre not endangering
your position Listen if you need to
come back and you want me to come take
over for a while Ill work it out I
mean the firms got other lawyers but

the magazines got only one of you

After a day of hard work and simple pleasures Annie begins to
succumb to old anxieties and pressures

INT CREEK HOUSE - NIGHT

Annie is awake reading the faxes Lucy sent One after other
As she flips through them one falls to the floor near the bed

She gets down on all fours to retrieve and sees something

under the bed AN OLD BATTERED CELLO CASE She pulls it out
to find the initials RB carved on the top She opens it to
find papers receipts bills -- all from Toms married life

EXT THE DOUBLE DIVIDE - EARLY MORNING

Tom rides a young colt along the creek He hears footsteps
He turns and sees Annie running along the creek on the other
side He stops to watch When his horse SNORTS Annie looks
up to see him She stops He tips his hat to her

ANNIE
Ive decided its impossible to
properly say hello in this place
without a hat

TOM
A jogger huh

ANNIE
I dont jog Mr Booker I run

TOM
Lucky for you The grizzlies around
here only go for joggers

ANNIE
If I can survive rush hour I figure I
can handle grizzlies

TOM
(smiles)
You sleeping all right in that house

ANNIE
I dont sleep all right anywhere But
the house is fine

Tom walks his horse across the creek to her comfortable in
the silence Annie moves about uncomfortable in the waiting
ANNIE
Whos RB

Tom is finding Annies blunt curiosity more endearing

ANNIE
I found this old cello case filled with
bills and receipts

TOM
Sorry about that I thought everything
got cleared out RB is my wife

ex-wife Rachel We used to live in
that house
together

ANNIE

I thought you lived in Chicago

TOM
I thought you were an editor not a
reporter

Annie smiles and nods realizing shes asking too many
questions

She tries to casually reach out to touch the horses head but

its too abrupt and the horse tosses his head away taking a

couple of steps back Annie is embarrassed

ANNIE
I have a way with animals

TOM
Its all right Hes young Just hold
out your hand a little lower so he can
get the smell of you

ANNIE
Oh yes I forgot

She does and the horse sniffs at her hand

ANNIE
Hes beautiful

TOM
Why dont you ride anymore Grace told
me you used to ride when she was
younger

ANNIE
She did
Annie is somewhat moved by her daughter telling him that

ANNIE
I dont know really No time mostly

A cold wind blows She folds her arms across her breasts

ANNIE
I thought it was supposed to be spring

Tom cant help but notice her nipples are hard from the cold
He looks away She laughs

ANNIE
Are you shy Mr Booker

TOM
Just polite Well maybe youd like
to try riding again some time before
you go home

Annie is struck by the words before you go home Tom ambles
off on his horse

TOM
Enjoy the day

ANNIE
You too

Annie steps across the rocks at the ford crossing the creek
Her foot slips one of her shoes goes into the water

ANNIE
Shit

TOM
Need a lift

ANNIE

I can handle it

She crosses the creek She turns giving him a small wave He
touches his hat She runs off Tom watches her go head down
concentrating

INT CREEK HOUSE - DAY

A tense Annie is having a difficult phone with DAVID
GOTTSCHALK
ANNIE
David weve been behind a day or
two before But Lucy just Fedexed me all
the material and itll be approved by
the end of the day

DAVID GOTTSCHALL (VO)
If nothing goes wrong If the faxes dont
go down If the phone lines are opened
I cant have this magazine hitting the
streets by the skin of its ass Annie

During Davids lines Diane has entered carrying fresh towels
-- she crosses into the bathroom

ANNIE
Oh come on This is such bullshit The
work is getting done David Lucky keeps
me on top of everything

DAVID GOTTSCHALK (VO)
Lucy isnt you Were losing something
without you being here Now I know this
is a rough time for you but I think we
should make another arrangement

Without Annies awareness Diane re-enters and takes her time
leaving so she can take in all of Annies things her
business office books etc

ANNIE
What the hell does that mean How much
more do I have to do to prove how
important this magazine is to me

DAVID GOTTSCHALK (VO)
If this magazine is so important to you
Annie why are you in Montana

Diane cant help but notice a slight vulnerability in Annie

DAVID GOTTSCHALK (VO)
Look this is what were going to do
Finish up this issue Ill set up a
conference call in a few weeks Just
you me and your lawyer and well

just work this out so that everyone
will be taken care of Fair enough

Annie is now aware of Dianes presence and chooses to play it

ANNIE

DAVID GOTTSCHALK (VO)

He hangs up Annie forces a smile to Diane

ANNIE
Thank you Youre all doing too much

DIANE
Oh its I wanted to tell you that

Annie doesnt know whether or not to accept

ANNIE
Oh Well thank you very much I

Before she finishes her line the Phone Rings again

ANNIE
Sorry
(to phone)
Hello Hi yeah I just spoke to him
Oh you know David Mr Strong Arm

Diane feels out of place and exits Annie doesnt notice
until she hears the door close She pushes back her hair and
takes a deep breath She looks out through the side window
and sees

Grace and Joe doing chores Grace looks involved and not at
all self-conscious A moment of gratitude and calm for Annie

EXT THE DOUBLE DIVIDE - DAY

Pilgrim bursts out of a chute and into the riding arena He
runs to the far end and abruptly stops Tom is holding the
orange flagstick and coiled rope coming through a gate

into the arena crossing to the middle of the ring Something
in his demeanor tells us that fun and game are over

Pilgrim and Tom stand there motionless eyeing each other
Pilgrim snorts and takes a few small steps backward Tom
takes a beat then starts slowly towards Pilgrim lifting the
flag and cracking it At the sound Pilgrim whirls away from
him and runs around the arena He starts to slow looking at
Tom Again Tom cracks the flag and Pilgrim runs round and
round the arena like a ringmaster Tom keeps Pilgrim
moving cracking the flag

Something about Toms demeanor tells us it isnt going well
EXT THE RANCH - DAY

Tom carrying a saddle comes around the side of the barn
Through the slats he sees Grace working in the barn
watering a horse She has stopped and is looking through the
cracks of Pilgrims stall at him She turns and sees Tom
through the slats She goes back to work as Tom comes to the
barn door

TOM
Come and take a ride with me

EXT THE RANCH - DAY
They walk towards his pick-up truck

TOM
Can you drive

GRACE
Drive Im not old enough yet

TOM
Its never too soon to start

He enters the passenger side

GRACE
I cant

TOM
I dont have all day

She hesitates and gets into the truck
INT PICK-UP TRUCK - DAY
Grace doesnt know what to do

TOM
Put the key in and turn it
(Grace obeys)
The right pedal is gas the other
ones the brake
GRACE
I dont know if I can with my leg

TOM
Well theres only one way to find out
(puts truck in gear)
Give it a little gas

She awkwardly puts her prosthetic foot on the gas pedal Too
much It lurches forward She takes her foot off

TOM
Well we know you can Now you just
got to feel how much Try it again

She does They slowly very slowly move along the dirt road

TOM
Nice real nice Theres a little
road down at the end here turn onto
it

Grace badly oversteers but makes the turn She drives along
the road across a pasture heading toward distant mountains

TOM
Just follow this Nothing to it Im
going to shut my eyes here for a
little while Just keep going till
you run out of road

GRACE
(afraid)
I dont know if I can

TOM
Not a question of if you can -- you
are Just keep your eyes on the road
and your foot on the pedal and the
rest will take care of yourself

Folding his arms over his chest shutting his eyes Tom
relaxes back Grace locks her hand on the steering wheel and
her eyes straight ahead

EXT DOUBLE DIVIDE - DAY

The truck is parked at the foot of a mountain Grace very
pleased with herself sits beside Tom on the cabs roof
looking around them at the great Montana After a beat

TOM
Where did you get Pilgrim from

GRACE
We bought him in Kentucky My mother
and I took a trip down there to see
him

TOM
That must have been pretty special

Grace nods It is a pleasant memory He motions for her to be
quiet An old ELK with a prodigious rack of antlers has come
down out of the mountains Seeing them he stops in his
tracks dead still They watch each other Then the elk turns
and runs back up into the mountains Tom smiles at Grace who
smiles back -- partly because of the elk partly because shes
alone with Tom

GRACE
Are you afraid of anything

TOM
(thinks)
Getting old Not being of much use
I guess
(beat)
What went on out there Grace With
Pilgrim

Grace doesnt say anything Tom nods then

TOM
You see Grace Ive got a problem
When Im working with a horse I like
to know its history Now most times
the horse can tell you pretty much the
whole story but sometimes he can be
so messed up in his head that you need
more to go on You need to know exactly
what went wrong Often times its the
obvious thing but something that went
wrong just before that maybe even some
little thing

Grace is quiet She doesnt want to think about that

TOM
Its like if Im driving and run into
a tree When somebody asks me Well
what happened I dont say Well
I plowed into a tree Id say The
sun was in my eyes or I skidded or
I took my mind off the road for a
second See what I mean

(Grace nods)
I dont know how you feel about talking
about it and I can understand you might
not want to But if Im going to figure
out whats going on in his head itd
sure help if I knew exactly what
happened that day

Grace looks away Tom smiles and gently puts his arm around
her shoulders which has a soothing effect on Grace -- making
her feel safe

TOM
Not today -- whenever you feel like it
I leave it up to you

Grace looks into Toms eyes wanting so much to unburden
herself
to him and have him make everything all right She nods

EXT RANCH HOUSE - LATE AT NIGHT

Tom is making his way to the house at the end of the day when
he stops and looks over to the Creek house --

POV -- the lights are on And he can see Annie exhausted
approving pages talking on the phone and faxing all
simultaneously

He gets an idea
EXT CREEK HOUSE - MORNING

Annie sits on the porch of the creek house with a guilt over
herself sipping coffee and deep in thought She looks up to
see

Tom riding towards the house on his horse leading another
horse behind him He looks to her and smiles

ANNIE
(murmurs)
Oh-oh

Tom reaches the house as Annie rises

ANNIE

The answers no

TOM
You havent heard the question yet Truth
is youd be doing me a favor I got all
these eager young colts need riding and
poor old Rimrock here is feeling kind of
left out

ANNIE
Poor thing

TOM
Hed be grateful hed take real good
care with you

ANNIE
Is this how youre going to make me pay
my phone bill

TOM
No matam Im afraid thats extra

She gives him a crooked smile

EXT THE RANCH PASTURE - DAY

Annie in Levis and a jacket rides Rimrock beside Tom across
the pasture We overhear them in the midst of talking

TOM
Relax our center Its just sitting
in a bucket

ANNIE
Yeah its been a while but I I

remember the basic ideas

TOM
OK Ill stop talking then

He rides a few steps ahead as Annie realizes she doesnt
remember She just went into automatic I dont have to be
told anything mode

ANNIE
Actually I never rode Western Im
sorry Go ahead

TOM
Well he dont know that Just sit the
horse
(watches her ride)
Good You have a nice seat
ANNIE

Thanks

TOM
Feel good

ANNIE
Yeah

TOM

You look all right You want to pick
it up a little

ANNIE
OK

Tom urges his horse into a center Annie canters alongside

TOM
Watch your reins hell go with you
give him some room let him do the
work Relax dont grab him with
your thighs just so long as he can
feel your body

Annie responds to every suggestion without resistance And
she experiences this sense of pleasure -- this great animal
beneath her the physicality and the surrender of letting
someone else lead

TOM
You want to let it go some more

She begins to let herself go losing herself in the experience

She just nods Tom breaks into a full gallop Annie follows
suit She lets everything go -- her job her marriage
motherhood guilt anxiety all of it Her only focus is the

horse beneath her and the man on the horse leading her
DISSOLVE TO

beautiful vista

ANNIE
Its a whole other world you have
going on here It just goes along
doing what it has to And youre a
part of it you just wake up and

and there you are And everything
that seems like life or death some
place else -- doesnt affect any of

this one bit

om is impressed by her feelings He sees her saddle cinch
eeds fixing and gets off his horse

TOM
Lift your leg

nnie complies once she realizes what hes doing
ANNIE
How long did you live here with your
wife
TOM

Five years My son was born here

ANNIE

Son

TOM

Hal Lives in New York near his mom

ANNIE
How did you meet her

TOM
College In Illinois She was playing
the cello I hadnt heard cello music
growing up She had the reddest hair
the bluest eyes When she played it
was

Tom cant find a beautiful enough word But Annie understands

TOM
She was the most beautiful thing Id
ever seen

Annie sees Tom as if with new eyes -- his love for this woman
he lost

ANNIE
Why didnt it work out

TOM
She was never really happy here She did
the best she could

Annie looks at him and for the first time senses a kinship --
an understanding they both have of being torn between two
worlds a desire for home

TOM
Grace told me you have a country house
in Connecticut Sounds like a beautiful
place

ANNIE
It is Its lovely

TOM
Ever think of moving there full time

ANNIE
We did at one point When we thought
wed have more children And we after
tried We tried everything but
wasnt meant to be

There is an awkward silent beat for a moment Annie is
momentarily self-conscious Tom helps by speaking of himself
TOM
I hear that See I knew she was never
going to be a ranchest but I wanted
to try -- I thought maybe shed give
music lessons to the kids in town or at
the school maybe even recitals My son
would grow up here Maybe have one or
two more Id teach em what I could
Theyd play with my brothers kids All
grow up together And even if they all
decided to go out into the world theyd
always know where home was -- cause wed
keep it for em

ANNIE
Thats very important to you isnt it
Home

TOM

Yeah I think it is And I dont mean
everybodys got to be married have kids
-- Its more like knowing where youre
from where you belong what feeds you
where you can go no matter what happens
nowing what youre supposed to be doing
while youre here

ANNIE
How did you find out all that

Tom looks right into her eyes and confesses without a shred
of self-consciousness

TOM

got lost

They smiles

EXT CREEK HOUSE - NIGHT

The world is in silhouette Off in the distance we see Tom
standing by his horse offering his hand to Annie helping

her off Theres an awkward moment neither of them wanting
the day or the moment to end

INT CREEK HOUSE - NIGHT

Grace is standing by the window looking out at them Their
movements indicate an intimacy that upsets her

EXT CREEK HOUSE - NIGHT
After a beat

Tom gets back on his colt He takes Rimrocks reins and leads
him off Annie stops for a moment watching him ride away

She watches her mother walk towards the house
INT CREEK HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

Grace watches her mother stand there a moment then turn and
walk towards the house Grace moves away from the window
her emotions churning -- jealousy anger -- and enters her
bedroom shutting the door

DISSOLVE TO
EXT THE PASTURE - EARLY MORNING

Joe hat tipped low is riding his horse leading some young
horses exercising them in the morning pasture He sees Grace
walking with her cane coming across the pasture

JOE

(shy)
Hi

She stops After a beat

GRACE
Would you let me ride your horse

JOE
(hesitates)
Have you talked to Tom about it

GRACE
Of course I have

JOE
(beat then)
I dont know You sure Tom said its
all right
She nods He hesitates
GRACE

Are you going to give me a hand or
arent you

He gets off his horse and holds it She puts down her cane
then puts her hand on the saddle horn She puts her
prosthetic leg into a stirrup Frightened she starts to
shake

JOE
You sure

Angry determined Grace tries to swing her leg onto the
horse She cant do it Tears of frustration on her face She
tries again She manages to pull herself halfway on her
prosthetic leg buckles and she falls Frightened Joe runs to
her

JOE
You okay

She gasps to catch her breath He reaches to help her up She
pulls her hand away Embarrassed she runs off Joe remains
still He hears a little VOICES He turns and sees the TWINS
having been watching the whole thing from a small hill As
they run off he yells threateningly

JOE
You better not say anything

EXT CREEK HOUSE - NIGHT

We follow Joe running towards the creek house fastening a
good shirt Hes dressed and cleaned for dinner Hes late

INT CREEK HOUSE - NIGHT

Annie is in the midst of making a spaghetti dinner Shes a
little frazzled but shes on top of it Grace enters wearing
a lovely dress -- it is the first time we have seen her in a
dress Annie hears her enter before she sees her asking

ANNIE
Honey would you see if anybody
wants --

Annie notices Grace standing there in her dress She stops

ANNIE
You look really pretty

Grace is a little self-conscious but grateful She begins
taking forks out of her dress pocket

GRACE
I thought there were too many forks

on the table

ANNIE
Well one was for salad

GRACE
Mom they dont mind eating with one
fork

ANNIE

(thinks then )
Youre right Good

Grace puts them away

ANNIE
Does anybody out there want
something to drink

GRACE
Ill take care of it

ANNIE
Thanks honey

Grace nods and exits to the living room
LIVING ROOM

The room is silent because every Booker is READING A
DIFFERENT COPY OF ANNIES MAGAZINE Frank covertly glimpses

at the scantily-clad models The Twins sharing a magazine
doing the same thing as their father but keeping an eye out
for mom Diane is looking at pictorial exposes on the kind

of lives she only hears about on audio tapes
Tom sits off to the side amused by the sight

Grace enters as Joe enters They nod across the room to each
other with a little smile

GRACE
Would anyone like something to drink

We hear a CRASH in the kitchen then

ANNIE (0S)
SHIT

Everybody looks up for a minute The Twins giggle Diane gives
them a dirty look

TOM
Ill give your mom a hand
Diane watches him enter the kitchen then returns to her
magazine

INT KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

Annie has dropped a hot pot into the sink after pouring the
tomato out of it and into a terrine

TOM
Everything under control

ANNIE
(laughs)
Not really Id forgotten how long
its been since Ive done this And
I couldnt get any Parmesan cheese

TOM
Just make yourself comfortable

ANNIE
I am comfortable

TOM
Ha ha all right well uh I guess
you can bring out the pasta

She undoes her apron and crosses towards the bowl Toms eyes
never leave her Its the first time hes seen her in her
dress sans apron As she lifts the bowl to hand to him she
realizes hes been looking at her Theres a silent moment
then

ANNIE
You missed a button

TOM
Huh

She looks for it Tom crosses to her and buttons it then
takes the bowl

ANNIE
Thank you

Theyre quiet for a beat as they exchange a look Suddenly
Grace enters -- she clearly doesnt like the two of them being
alone Annie quickly covers

ANNIE
Oh good Grace would you bring in
the bread Ill get the salad and
then were all set

Tom has already exited by the time Annie finishes and Grace
grabs the bread basket

INT CREEK HOUSE - LATER THAT NIGHT

We parachute into the middle of the meal The spaghetti is a
hit We cut to different conversations and reactions around
the table

Frank is in the middle of saying

FRANK
Itd be a whole lot easier to pay
the feed end of the month

TOM
I dont think Warren would go for that

Grace is talking to Joe and the Twins

GRACE

like for instance you can go on
the Internet and access this thing
called The Visible Man -- who was this
murderer they caught in Texas that was
executed and donated his body to
science and you can call him up on the
screen and dissect him like in Three-D

Grace eats as she talks Joe and the Twins are fascinated
Annie asks Tom Frank and Diane
ANNIE

Well did you ever think about hiring
a business manager

FRANK
We have a business manager The best
around

DIANE
Ha

TOM

Diane takes care of the books I dont
know how but at the end of every
month everything adds up to the penny

DIANE
Aint brain surgery

ANNIE
Its pretty impressive Where I come
from youd be a gold mine

Diane doesnt know how to accept that but inside shes
bursting with pride She focuses on the Twins who fight

TWINS
This is MY fork Thats YOUR fork ya
idiot

DIANE
Hey You stop that kind of talk at the
table

FRANK

Ill have another round of that
spaghetti if may

ANNIE
Absolutely I made enough for an army

DIANE
I uh I like the sauce very much Maybe
I get the recipe

Annie is so pleased and is about to reply but Grace noticing
Tom smiling at Annie

GRACE
Its from a jar

Theres an odd silence as a deflated Annie serves Frank

FRANK
Thank you

Finally Diane saves it

DIANE
Well I tried jar sauce once --
wasnt this good Ya gotta know
which brand to buy Id like to
get the name of this one

Annie is grateful Grace feels foolish
TWIN (SCOTT)

screen
DIANE

GRACE
Its just my computer

DIANE
Oh I dont --

ANNIE
Its okay Grace show them Im going
to put the coffee on I made an apple
tart for dessert

The Twins excitedly move to the computer Joe waits for Grace

DIANE
Ill help you with the coffee

ANNIE
Well I know I should reject that
offer but Im not going to

DIANE
(jovial)
No reason you should no reason you
should

They exit into the kitchen Frank continues eating

Tom looks around -- Grace showing the boys the computer Annie
and Diane in the kitchen For a second we see Tom realize an
image of the life he once thought he could

INT KITCHEN - NIGHT
As Diane and Annie prepare coffee and dessert

DIANE
I was looking in one of your magazines
and saw that picture of the couple
getting married at the Pyramids Were
you ever in Egypt

ANNIE
I was there for that shot actually

DIANE
What was it like

ANNIE
Oh God -- I think it was the fourth
or fifth time Id been there so all
I remember was the heat and how
incompetent the photographer was

She laughs as she directs this last line to Diane who just
smiles And Annie realizes thats not what she meant at all
This woman is starving for glimpses into this other life

ANNIE

But uh Egypt is well its like
nothing else Its like going back in
time

(Diane listens)
I remember as a kid trying to imagine
what a kid my age centuries ago
walking over that same ground was
wondering about or if they had the
same problems as me and I felt
connected to to time itself almost
Ha I never realized how hard it was
to describe

DIANE
Id love to go there one time

ANNIE
You and Frank ever take a vacation

DIANE
Soon Were going to Branson Missouri
to see my cousin Emma married Frank
loves in there

Annie can sense the disappointment in her voice and at the

same time the comfortable resignation

Suddenly from inside they hear LOUD OVERLAPPING VOICES as

the children fight

TWIN (SCOTT)
IT WAS MY TURN

JOE
YA JUST HAD A TURN IT WAS NOT

TWIN (SCOTT)
WAS So

LIVING ROOM

Diane and Annie enter to find Joe and Scott fighting

as Tom
tries to break them up

TOM
Boys Settle down

TWIN (SCOTT)
You never let me have a turn

JOE
Dont be such a baby

TWIN (SCOTT)
You just showing off for her

JOE

TWIN (SCOTT)

ANNIE

GRACE

Joe lunges for Scott and the two start rolling in a fight
Frank and Tom work to pull them apart as Diane yells

DIANE
Annie Im so sorry but theyre just
tired Well have dessert another time
Frank get them out of here
(to other Twin)
Come on Say good night and thank

Voices everywhere Yelling Thank yous During which
Grace quickly turns and exits Annie eyes follow her out of
the room but with her guests and the chaos she doesnt know
whether or not to leave

FRANK
Dinner was delicious Thank you
(to Twins)
Say thank you

Diane and Frank usher the kids out Tom holds onto Joe until
theyre gone then lets him go

JOE
Sorry maam I thank you for dinner

ANNIE

JOE
(hesitates)
I expect you should talk to Grace about
that maam And if I did anything
wrong then I am sorry

Ever the gentlemen Joe exits Annie looks to Tom Hes about
to leave when he stops and says

TOM
Dont let her turn you away

Tom exits

Annie stands and faces Graces closed door Slowly she
lowers herself to her knees and sits on them thinking
reminiscent of Tom waiting for his moment with Pilgrim in
the field

INT CREEK HOUSE GRACES ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

We dont know how long Annie waited but she knocks gently
then enters to find Grace in her nightgown on her bed with
the night stand light on Her prosthesis is against the wall

ANNIE
Grace Is everything all right
(no answer)
Can we talk

GRACE
About what

ANNIE
Well

GRACE

GRACE
NO YOU STOP IT Stop pretending like

you and Tom

ANNIE

(angry)
WHAT How can you --

(at a loss)
Im sorry if my friendship with Tom
bothers you so much but I happen to
value having someone to talk to
especially when my own daughter
ignores me night and day because no
matter what I say its wrong and no
matter what I do its wrong Im
sorry Im such a disappointment to
you

GRACE
Well now you know what it feels like

ANNIE
I dont deserve that I have never
looked at you as a disappointment If
Im on your back to do better if I
push you to try harder its because
I want you to be the best you can be

GRACE
FOR YOU Because Im your daughter
which means youre the best mother
snt that what youre always talking
about in interviews -- having it all
the great career the great family
Proving everybody wrong Wanting
everybody to think youre this perfect
woman

heyre both exhausted

ANNIE

Listen if if theres a part of you
as parent that that takes pride in
your child -- that you can look at

them and see something youve
accomplished as well if thats wrong
then Im sorry

(no answer)
But it wasnt my intention I dont push
for me I do it for you So you dont
waste half your life feeling like you
dont know where you belong

GRACE
Yeah well youve done a great job

Beat Annie feels deeply hurt

ANNIE
Well then I do apologize But what
Im most sorry for is turning you
into a spoiled brat who can only
think about what shes feeling who
cant admit when shes wrong and who
cant forgive when shes not

GRACE
LEAVE ME ALONE

Annie stops to exit as Grace says something under her breath
Annie stops

ANNIE
What did you say

GRACE
I said I started

Grace starts to sob Annie doesnt understand

ANNIE
Started what

GRACE
My period

ANNIE

(softer)

When Tonight

GRACE

(nods)
I felt it happen downstairs and when
I went into the bathroom

Annie reaches down to touch Graces shoulder Grace turns --
there is no anger in her face Annie sits and takes her in
her arms Grace clings to her and sobs like a little girl
Annie sees tears run -- gratefully lovingly

GRACE
Whos going to want me now

ANNIE
What Oh baby

GRACE
Whos ever going to want me Nobody

will

ANNIE
Thats not true

GRACE

Why should they

ANNIE

Because you are one of the most
incredible bravest most beautiful
woman I have ever met The efforts
you make Your courage and your
dignity

(laughs thru tears)
I dont know where you got it I
honestly dont know how I would have
handled all this if I were you

Grace is so grateful they cling to each other even harder
As the tears subside Grace manages to admit

GRACE
Im sorry about what I said Its
just that -- all those times you
and Daddy were trying for another
kid I I used to pray at night that

it would work And not because of

you guys or that I wanted a brother

or sister but just so I wouldnt
have to be

ANNIE
What

GRACE
So special Because I was the only
one You both wanted me to be so
good at everything so perfect and
I wasnt I was just me And now Ive
completely ruined everything
anyway

They both start crying again as Annie rocks her gently

ANNIE
Sshhh Ssshhhh

They hold each other as if for dear life

LATER -- CAMERA PANS to discover mother and daughter fast
asleep in each others arms

INT TOMS ROOM RANCH HOUSE - NIGHT

Tom sits alone writing at his desk His music is playing
He stops to look out the window overlooking the Creek House

Annie and Grace fell asleep with the lights still on in the
living room

Tom is thinking of Grace and Annie -- wondering what happened
after he left conflicted by what he feels for Annie And
remembering why theyre here in the first place

DISSOLVE TO
INT CREEK HOUSE - NEXT MORNING
The phone rings awakening Annie first then Grace

Operator Im ready

EXT RIDING ARENA - LATER THAT MORNING

Annie and Grace are standing by the arena fence Frank Joe
and the Twins are sitting on the fence rail Joe is holding a
saddle and a bridle standing in some shadows in an empty
arena Pilgrim comes running into the ring Out of habit he
starts circling the ring He sees Tom holding a saddle
Pilgrim walks towards him Curious he stops looking at him
Tom puts the saddle down sitting crossways on it Pilgrim
walks towards him again He stops looking at Tom again Tom
just sits there playing with the bridle Pilgrim walks
around him Tom doesnt show him any interest Pilgrim comes
closer He looks at the saddle He runs off He stops
looking back Tom just sits Pilgrim walks back over Tom
stands and shows him the bridle Pilgrim comes closer
sniffing it He rubs his nose against the leather Tom pats
his head Then in one quick but deft motion he puts the
bridle on him Pilgrim tosses his head but it doesnt seem
to bother him Grace and Annie watch intently Tom takes the
reins walking Pilgrim around the ring He walks him to the
saddle Pilgrim paws at it with his hoof He turns and runs
off Tom lets him go Pilgrim runs around the ring slows
down looks over at Tom Tom picks up the saddle Pilgrim
cautiously comes back over Tom with the saddle walks away
from him Pilgrim again curious follows him He nudges Tom
Tom stops Pilgrim comes around to take a good look at the
saddle Tom rubs his back And gently like laying down a
sheet puts the saddle on his back Pilgrim shuffles slightly
at the touch Tom quickly cinches it Taking up the reins he
walks Pilgrim around the ring again He starts to jog
Pilgrim jogs with him And in the middle of the jog Tom
grabs onto the saddle horn and without breaking his stride
pulls himself back up onto his back He lays across the
saddle letting Pilgrim feel his weight He sits up and
without letting him break his stride he urges Pilgrim with
his thighs keeping him in the jog riding around the ring

Grace and Annie cheer Tom tips his hat to them
INT THE BARN - DAY

Grace is cleaning stalls etc She exits one of the stalls
with a pail and stops -- looking down the barn to where she
knows Pilgrim is She places the pail down and gathers her
courage She walks to Pilgrims stall She stands motionless
for some moments before she opens the doors and enters

Pilgrim steps back a bit He looks at her He pins his ears
back Stomps his feet Grace is about to turn and leave but
she stops herself and remains still

Slowly she reaches out to touch Pilgrims head and he
lets her We see in Grace a maturity of character a
willingness to face what she must face the beginning of a

compassion not only for Pilgrim but perhaps for herself as
well

EXT DOUBLE DIVIDE - NIGHT

A full moon lights the ranch Tom pulls up to the ranch house
in his truck parks and gets out As he walks towards the
house he hears

Grace exits the Creek House and coming towards him a coat
over her nightgown Tom waits until she reaches him

GRACE
I was waiting for you to come back

Tom instinctively knows what she wants

TOM
You hungry

INT RANCH HOUSE KITCHEN - NIGHT

Grace sits at the table Tom is cooking at the stove It feels
as if they are the only two people on earth Grace gets up her
nerve and begins

GRACE
Judith was telling me about this boy
she really liked She never even had
a chance to tell me his name

She starts to quietly cry but it doesnt stop her

GRACE
We were going to go around by the
railroad bridge

And we see the accident all over again But this time a
movie -- as clear as reality -- but in deathly silence Just
the sound of Graces voice and her heartbeat

EXT THE WOODS CONNECTICUT - EARLY MORNING
The horses are going up the icy path

GRACE (VO)
We were laughing about something I
dont remember what Her horse fell

Judiths horse suddenly stumbles on the ice going down
throwing Judith her foot helplessly caught in the stirrup
Her horse sliding back down the hill

Grace tries to move Pilgrim to avoid the errant horse but
its too late the horse plows into them the horses sliding
back down the hillside onto the empty COUNTRY ROAD

EXT COUNTRY ROAD CT - EARLY MORNING
Pilgrim is first to find his legs Judiths horse its leg

broken at the ankle walks in a confused state Judiths foot
is helplessly caught in the stirrup

GRACE (VO)
Judiths foot was caught in the

stirrup she couldnt get up she
was so scared

(cries)
I saw this truck coming around the
turn

She sees the glint of the steel The Truck suddenly appears
from around the bend

GRACE (VO)
He was honking trying to get us to
move I tried to grab the reins to
get Judiths horse out of the way

Grace grabs the reins of Judiths horse The horses are
spooking

GRACE (VO)
And the truck started skidding

The truck skidded on the icy road going out of control jack-
knifing heading right for them

GRACE (VO)
It was coming right at us There
wasnt any time to do anything It
ran right into Judiths horse

The truck bed plows into Judiths horse

GRACE (VO)
Judith just disappeared And it
came right at Pilgrim and me

We see this

GRACE (VO)
-And Pilgrim reared up at the truck
and I fell off

Grace falls onto the road the truck running over her
INT RANCH HOUSE KITCHEN - NIGHT
Grace sobs uncontrollably now

GRACE
Judith Oh God Judith Im sorry

Tom is near and holds her as she puts her head on his chest

TOM

his bad But I can tell you you
idnt do anything wrong The same
hing would have happened to me or

ense in looking for a reason why

(self-reflective)
I used to try and always came up

tO yt Oo tH

e get I remember this boy Id see

p on the Blackfeet Reservation He
was sixteen Great kid Strong Hed
gone swimming and dived headfirst into
a rock Snapped his neck paralyzed
him After the accident Id look

in on him from time to time and he
wasnt there anymore His mind his
spirit whatever you want to call it
it just disappeared And what was left

was nothing but anger Its like the
boy I knew just went away somewhere

GRACE
I know where he goes

TOM
I know you do Dont you disappear
(holds her tighter)
You do whatever you have to to hold

on
(thinks)

Ill tell you one more thing When

Pilgrim reared up to face that

truck you know what I think I

he was trying to protect you Thats

what I think

Grace listens to this As Tom holds her in silence its
almost as if they were father and daughter

EXT THE CORRAL - PRE-DAWN

Tom stands with Grace in the corral Toms horse Rimrock is
saddled nearby Tom takes Graces cane

TOM
Let me hold that

Grace stands looking at the horse

GRACE
I cant not yet

TOM
Theres no hurry Take you time

Shes trying so hard to be brave After a moment she reaches
for the saddle horn She puts her prosthetic leg in the

stirrup takes a breath and swings her leg up -- slipping
falling to the ground Tom doesnt say anything She pulls
herself back up She repeats the action determinedly She

swings her leg over again and sits squarely on the horse Tom
remains still but proud

As the day breaks we leave them in silence -- Tom standing
hands in pocket Grace sitting up on the horse proudly

EXT DOUBLE DIVIDE THE PASTURE - EARLY MORNING

Endless sky Annie is jogging off in the distance when she
looks up and stops to see Tom and Grace both on horses
stopped on a rolling hill They do not see her

Annie is filled with emotion pride for her daughter
gratitude for this amazing man

As the two ride off into the distance we do a slow
FADE OUT
SHOCK CUT
BRIGHT SUNSHINE CATTLE DRIVE
EXT THE MOUNTAINS - DAY

Frank and Diane with the Twins dogs at their heels ride in
front of the herd Behind them Joe riding alongside Grace
Smokey and some Hands ride among the herd keeping them moving

And riding behind the herd are Annie and Tom

MONTAGE OF VARIOUS MOMENTS THROUGHOUT THE DAY DURING THE CATTLE
DRIVE Highlighting in particular those in which the rising
sexual tension between Tom and Annie is apparent

EXT THE MOUNTAINS - NIGHT
The cattle stands in silhouette We hear singing

Everyone is sitting around a campfire Franks playing the
guitar singing along with Tom They laugh when a lyric or a
note goes wrong Everyone is enjoying it

Annie her arms around her knees sits off by herself The
song ends and people applaud

Frank hands the guitar to Hank

FRANK
Play that sweet one you know The one
makes my wife here so friendly

DIANE
(slaps his shoulder)
You

Hank begins to play and sing a painfully pretty song His
sweet voice is stark contrast to his gruff strongman
appearance Frank offers his hand to Diane she slaps it away
and laughs he helps her up and they start to dance As
everyone watches
Joe stands and offers his hand to Grace

JOE
You wouldnt want to dance with me
would you

GRACE
I dont thinks youd want me tripping
all over you in front of everybody

JOE
(sweetly)
I wouldnt let happen

GRACE
(affectionately)
You know youre a good kid

Joe smiles and helps her up They come together and start
dancing

Annie is watching holding her breath with gratitude

Tom notices Annie off by herself and crosses to her He
extends his hand She hesitates looks again to Grace with
Joe then accepts

His hand slide to her back Her hand to his shoulder They
dance Their bodies closer than theyve ever been Slowly
she leans her head against his body And surrenders for the
moment

Diane sees them She holds her husband fast and buries her
head on his neck

EXT THE MOUNTAINS - DAY

MORE CATTLE DRIVE MANTAGE -- Taking Tom and Annie a bit
further in their intimacy perhaps Tom takes extra special
care to explain things to Annie or fix her saddle cinch or
make her laugh

EXT THE MOUNTAINS - EVENING

The cows stands in the pasture grazing Annie and Diane are
cleaning some pots and pans in the stream

DIANE
Must be nice for you to take a few
days off from your work huh
ANNIE
Well I have more than a few days ha
ha I uh Im sort of not an
editor anymore right now First
time Ive said it out loud

DIANE
They fired you
ANNIE
No its more like a leave of-

(stops)
Ha ha ha Yeah they fired me

DIANE
You dont seem to upset

ANNIE
Delayed shock Or maybe not I know
I could talk my way back if I wanted

or go to another magazine
someplace Just not sure if I want
to

DIANE

Guess you dont have to figure it out
until you go home

This phrase go home stings Annie -- though Diane said it
innocently

ANNIE
Did you always know this was the life
you wanted

DIANE
I fell in love After that I never
thought about being anything but a
ranchers wife I never saw it like I
was losing some other life just felt
like I was gaining one I know thats
not a popular opinion nowadays and I
aint saying its the right one We
all have to find the life meant for us

ANNIE
Franks a good man

DIANE
They dont come better But I dont
deny there are times I wonder about
things I wont have Maybe one day Ill
get to see Egypt Maybe not But I know
if you try too many different lives
you can wind up with no life at all

ANNIE
Sounds like something Tom would say

DIANE
Yes it does

Annie and Diane resume washing the dishes in silence Annie
deep in thought Until Diane stops After a beat Annie
notices

ANNIE
What

DIANE
Annie Im not good at this kind of talk
-- goes round and round a thing but
never comes to it -- so lets just say
what it is When you first came here
I didnt like you and I was worried Tom
means a lot to me and this family Dont
go looking here for whatever you looking
for Dont make that man go through
something it took him a long time to see
his way clear out of the first time

ANNIE
I dont think anybody can make Tom do
anything he didnt want

DIANE
Hes a good man Tom is Hes got a
gift come from heaven above I swear
But hes still a man And a woman can
lead a man into the middle of a mountain
lake -- and still make him think hes on
dry land

Dianes words ring in Annies head
EXT THE MOUNTAINS - DEAD OF NIGHT

Dead in stillness The cattle dark and motionless Everyone
asleep in bedrolls around the pasture

Annie awakens looks up at the moon watching it go in and
out of the clouds She looks over to sleeping Grace Then
looks to where Tom is -- and sees his sleeping bag is empty
Quietly she rises and looks for him
She starts across the grass and sees him crossing on his
haunches wearing a slicker sitting in the grass by the
stream drinking some water She watches him

Tom senses something and turns For a moment they just look
at each other -- half disbelieving the inevitable is so close
at hand Annie approaches as Tom rises

They meet They kiss Tentative at first but more just to
make that very precious first moment of discovery last as
long as it can The kiss grows more passionate They begin to
lose themselves in each other

Until suddenly aware of their surroundings they part No
words Their expressions to each other tell all Annie
separates herself and goes back to her bedroll Tom stands
in the grass by the stream the moving water the nights
only sound

pasture Tom is standing with Robert -- in jeans now -- and
Grace telling Robert about the ranch Robert has his arms
around Grace asking questions interested in everything

EXT ANOTHER PART OF THE RANCH - DAY

Tom continues his tour as the dogs run about them Tom pays
the dogs no attention except to bark an order Robert
however engages with them -- picking up a stick and throws
it A dog returns and gives it back Robert kneels and begins
rubbing the dogs fur talking to it looking like an
anachronism in his baggy jeans with designer cowboy belt and
spanking new designer cowboy boots

Tom waits patiently for Robert who and carries on with
the dog a bit too long When Robert gets up he habitually
brushes the dirt off his jeans maybe even his boots and
makes sure his outfit is hanging properly

INT BARN - DAY

Grace is in the stall with Pilgrim Once again close enough
to touch him which he allows

Outside the stall stand Robert and Tom Robert squeezes his

Laughter Robert continues giving a quick look to Annie --

INT CREEK HOUSE - NIGHT

through a window He stares at this creature he loves so
much He rises and enters Annies room

ROBERT
Tired

Annie shrugs Robert looks at the bed He teases
ROBERT
Small bed Maybe I should sleep in
the barn

ANNIE

Annie smiles sympathetically

EXT BARN DANCE HANKS RANCH - DUSK
Cars and pick-up trucks haphazardly parked along a dirt

road Smoking open grill barbecues Ranchers and families
move about the ranch sit and eat at picnic tables with
gingham tablecloths Some teenagers hanging around the
corral talking Diane and some other women eating and
talking Frank with a group of men drinking beer telling
stories

A BAND has been set up by the barn People are dancing under
the harvest moon Grace is dancing with Joe Tom is dancing
with a local woman Annie with a rancher Everyone is
having a good time

Robert is enjoying a smoke with some men He looks over to
the dance floor and smiles when he sees Grace and Joe

Joe and the Rancher trade place Joe dances with Annie the
Rancher with Grace But Tom sees his chance and switches
with the Rancher so that he can dance with Grace She is

thrilled and he guides her effortlessly across the floor

Joe and Annie are interrupted by another couple Joe switches
partners but Annie smiles and excuses herself -- she wants to
rest

Robert continues talking with some of the men He puts out

his smoke and looks over to the dance floor He sees Grace now
dancing with Tom His eyes search for Annie He moves away
from the men until he sees from a distance

Annie sitting by herself amidst the crowd No one would
notice her unless they were looking for her But Robert does
-- and what he sees is Annie looking at Grace and Tom then
only looking at Tom Smiling to herself gently Watching
his every move Suddenly she rises and exits out of the barn
to get some air

EXT HANKS RANCH - NIGHT

Annie finds an isolated spot behind the main house to be by
herself and catch her breath

INT BARN - NIGHT

Tom and Grace continue dancing Shes in heaven Robert
approaches and Tom quickly allows him to take over Grace
loves the attention from both men As they dance off Tom
crosses the dance floor and is met by Hanks wife

HANKS WIFE
Oh Tom would you check the shed and see
if theres anymore chairs
TOM
Sure

EXT HANKS RANCH - NIGHT

Tom is walking along when he turns the corner of Hanks house
and finds

Annie sitting alone staring up at the night They see each
other From behind the house no one else can see them

It is as if the fates brought them face to face and alone
Without any will to stop it they embrace and kiss
passionately But when they look into each others eyes
there is no joy in the kiss Tom releases her and walks away
heading for the shed Annie quickly pulls herself together
and enters the main house through the back door

INT DOUBLE DIVIDE RANCH KITCHEN - NIGHT

Diane is once more sitting at the kitchen table looking over
some bills before bed Her tape player is on softly Tom
enters and crosses to the sink to get a glass of water

Diane looks up seeing Tom with his back to her -- standing at
the sink filling his glass -- staring out the window over the
sink She looks to the dish of brownies on the table

DIANE
I have some brownies left over Want
one

TOM

(wo turning around)
No thanks

Diane senses an uneasiness in Tom She looks as he drinks his
water

MEDIUM CLOSE-UP ON TOMS BACK as if from Dianes POV

But when we pull back we find ourselves

INT BARN - NIGHT

Tom is standing in front of Pilgrims stall He opens the
door They look at each other He strokes him and begins to

whisper

TOM
Theres something you have to do
fence

tomorrow boy

Camera gently moves away and Tom whispers to Pilgrim what
must be done

EXT THE RIDING ARENA - DAY

Theres a stillness A sense of import Annie Robert Frank
Diane Joe and Smokey are all at various spots along the

Grace stands inside the ring Tom is standing beside Pilgrim
in the middle of the ring Pilgrim is bridled and saddled
Tom adjusts he stirrup He walks over to Grace

TOM
All set

Grace swallows hard nodding Shes worried

TOM
Sure

GRACE
(softly)
Sure

Tom puts his arms around her shoulders and walks out to
Pilgrim The horse pricks up his ears as they approach Tom
motions Grace to stop a short distance from Pilgrim so as not
to crowd him Tom walks over alone reaching to gently take
hold of him Holding him by the bridle he puts his head
beside Pilgrims quietly speaking to him soothing Pilgrims
neck with his other hand

Annie and Robert are fascinated Anxious

Pilgrim never takes his eyes off Grace Tom tries to ease him
forward Pilgrim resists lifting his head and looking at
Grace so you can see the white at the top of his eye Tom
turns him away walking him in circles trying to calm him
He leads him back to Grace Pilgrim tosses his head and
stomps his feet

Robert grows more anxious Annie is calmer more focused
Tom climbs up on him riding him around the arena in an easy
lope Grace watches them go round the ring She looks at her

parents and tries to smile They try as well

Tom dismounts and leads Pilgrim back to Grace Pilgrim balks
again violently throwing his head kicking Graces
shoulders slump she presses her hands in her pockets
fighting not to cry

TOM
Smokey

Smokey climbs over the rail into the ring as Tom says something
to him Meanwhile Frank reassures Grace

FRANK
Hell be okay Grace Just you hang
on there a minute or two Tomll get
him okay youll see

Smokey jogs over to the gate climbing it and disappearing
into the barn Tom crosses to Grace

TOM
Theres still something going on
inside of him I cant reach So me
and Smokey here were going to
try laying him down Okay

GRACE
What does that mean

TOM
Its more or less how it sounds
Sometimes its not pretty to watch
Some horses fight it real hard
Your fellas already shown us he
likes a good fight So if you dont
want to watch Ill call you when its
done

GRACE
I want to watch

Smokey re-enters the ring carrying some rope He talks
briefly to Tom Pilgrim sensing something turns and runs to
the far side of the ring Tom his arms spread walks over

to him keeping him by the fence Tom takes him by the
bridle Smokey comes beside him Tom unhitches the bridle and
in its place slips a rope halter Smokey passes to him

Smokey then hands him two long ropes one at a time Tom
fastens one under the halter and ties the other to the saddle
horn Tom asks Smokey

TOM
You got that soft rope

Smokey hands it to him Tom quietly talks to Pilgrim runs
his hand down Pilgrims left foreleg and lifts his hoof
Pilgrim slightly shifts And when hes still Tom slips the
loop at the end of the soft rope over the hoof making sure
its snug And taking the other end of the rope he hoists the
weight of Pilgrims raised hoof and ties the rope to the
saddle horn Pilgrim stands on three legs -- an explosion
waiting to happen Tom moves away from Pilgrim taking the
halter line from Smokey Pilgrim trying to move finds hes
crippled Scared he lurches hopping on his right foreleg
Seeing he cant walk panicked he tries to run Tom and
Smokey brace themselves lean back on their ropes and force
him around them in a tight circle He goes around and around
like a crazed rocking horse with a broken leg Tom looks over
and sees Annie has left Robert outside the ring to stand by
an anguished Grace -- her hands on her shoulders gripping
her Robert watches feeling too much a foreigner

GRACE
What is he doing this

FRANK
Itll be OK Grace

But even Frank isnt so sure Pilgrim covered in sweat
still circles As he runs his hobbled foot jabs at the air
trying to find peace He runs and runs as Tom and Smokey lean
on the ropes -- until he cant run any more and stops Tom and
Smokey let the lines go slack Pilgrim stands there his wet
sides heaving panting like an asthmatic making loud rasping
sounds Tom and Smokey speak Smokey hands him his rope
Turning he gets a coiled lasso out of the sand He swings
the rope in a wide loop and makes it fall over Pilgrims
saddle horn He pulls it tight And he takes the other end of
the rope to the far side of the fence and ties it in a quick
release knot to the bottom rung Coming back he takes the
other two lines from Tom Tom crosses to the rail He starts
putting pressure on the rope Pilgrim feeing it braces
himself The pressure tilts the saddle hold downward

FRANK
(to Grace and Annie)
Hes trying to get him to go down
on his knees

Pilgrim fights Tom pulls on the rope Pilgrim slowly
begrudgingly gives ground Tom brings him to his knees
but it is short lived Pilgrim is muscling his way back to
his feet Tom pulls him down to his knees again Pilgrim
fighting with every bit of strength slowly gets to his feet
again But the pressure Tom is putting on the saddle is too
strong and relentless and finally Pilgrim goes down on his
knees and stays down Yet Tom keeps the pressure on Tom
shouts to Smokey

TOM
Drop the lines and come help me

Smokey dropping the line runs over They both pull on
the saddle rope

GRACE
Thats enough Stop it

Pilgrim snorts and foams at the mouth fighting But
slowly like a wounded bird she starts giving in He
rolls over on his side and lays his head in the sand and
is still It seems like a total humiliating surrender
Grace starts to sob burying her face in Annies chest
Robert feels impotent to help

TOM
GRACE

Tom and Smokey stand over the fallen horse like two big
game hunters at the carcass of a kill

TOM
GRACE Will you come here please

Grace shakes her head NO Frank motions to Annie for
her to let Grace go to let stand alone We see

that its not easy for Annie to trust this but she does
And she steps back to where Robert stands

Tom his face set walks toward Grace

TOM
Grace I need you to come with me

Grace violently shakes her head NO Robert gets up the
courage to say aloud

ROBERT
Well maybe she shouldnt be here

Annie quickly turns to him and says with quick intensity

ANNIE
Robert Let him handle it Please

Robert cant watch this He turns and takes a few steps
Just stops standing behind and apart from Annie to
just watch slowly becoming transfixed like someone
who cant stop staring at an accident

Tom reaches Grace and puts his hand tenderly on her shoulder

TOM
Grace I need you to come with me

GRACE
No youre only going to hurt him
some more

TOM
Hes not hurt Hes okay Look at him

GRACE
(turned away)
No
TOM
Grace Listen youve got to do this

Just trust me one more time

Grace looks into his eyes and is reminded of all this man
has done for her and she remembers her trust

GRACE
Do what

Tom prouder of her now than ever before

TOM
Ill show you

Tom leads her across the ring with his arm around her
shoulder Annie tries to maintain her composure Robert
remains still and focused

Tom and Grace come to Pilgrim lying in the dirt his
breathing plaintive Tom speaks gently

TOM
I want you to lay down with him I
want you to stroke him I want to
start with his hindquarters and rub
him feel him all over

Grace is shaking her head NO He speaks more firmly

TOM
Grace youve got to do what I say

Grace knows theres no way out She takes a breath and slowly
kneels in the dirt beside him with Toms help She lays on
him rubbing him his hindquarters his legs his side
softly rubbing his neck and the wet silky side of his head

TOM
Now listen I want you to stand on
him

ANNIE
What

Tom responds to their voice without looking at them

TOM
PLEASE
(they stop)
Grace do what Im telling you Stand
on him now

Grace obeys him through her tears She lets Tom take her hand
and guide her up onto the curve of Pilgrims belly Then he
lets go Grace stands there with teas steaming down her

face -- standing on the animal she loved most in the world

ANNIE
Its so cruel

FRANK
No He had the choice

ANNIE
What choice

FRANK
Either fight the way things are or
accept it

Robert however is hypnotized by the event He is having a
private epiphany of sorts

Grace sits in the dirt by Pilgrim and strokes him quietly --
she begins talking to him the way Tom does Tom watches as
he cautiously steps further away Pilgrim looks up at Grace
out of the dark pool of his one sad eye They look at each
other And we understand theres a connection once more A
moment of understanding and forgiveness

Grace starts to untie his ropes Smokey is about to stop her
but Tom shakes NO

Pilgrim like an infant coming out of the water breathing
life for the first time gets to his feet Grace and him look
to each other And all is still
Grace grabs the saddle horn Pilgrim shuffles as if hes
going to bolt Grace quietly reassures him She then
carefully puts her prosthetic leg in the stirrup Pilgrim
shifts slightly Annie covers her mouth so as not to scream
out her fear Robert breaths heavily They watch as Grace
swings her leg determined and pulls herself into the
saddle Sitting on his back Pilgrim tosses his head and
looks as hes going to run off But Grace puts her arms
around his neck and once again quietly reassures him

She starts to ride him slowly her arms around his neck
talking all the while around the ring

Annie laughs as she cries -- emotion overwhelming her Robert
feels almost numb with fascination gratitude confusion

The slow ride turns into a trot then a lope then a
canter round and round the ring Frank and Diane smile
Diane looks to Tom and knows what hes feeling

Tom watches as any father would -- his heart pounding with
pride for the miracle of his child But he doesnt let on for
a second

Grace brings Pilgrim to a stop lifts her arms to the

heavens victorious Everyone cheers Smokey helps her off

the horse She stops to look at Tom who busies himself with
picking up the ropes So she re-focuses on her parents They
run to each other and embrace First she and Annie then
she and her father

But as Robert and Grace hold each other and begins to exit
Annie manages to make eye contact with Tom and tell him
with one look how grateful she is and how much she loves
him And he receives it

INT CREEK HOUSE - DAY

Everything is being packed up Robert is dressed for travel
Annie is taping up the boxes containing her computer
equipment

ANNIE
Are you going to stay in the city or
go up to Connecticut

ROBERT
Connecticut I told the office Id
work out of there next week When are
you planning to start back

ANNIE
Probably first thing in the morning

Its too late to start now Im going
to try not to do too much driving in

the dark

ROBERT
May I have a suggestion

ANNIE
Yeah what
ROBERT
Take your time
ANNIE
(innocently)

What do you mean

Annie looks up from the box to see Robert is calmly staring
at her His demeanor is different Somethings going on

ANNIE
You look like somethings wrong

This is Roberts moment He knows it He takes a breath and
hopes it comes out right

ROBERT
Ill tell you something Annie -- I
stood there looking at what was
happening to that horse And I

swear it felt like the same thing
was happening to me

ANNIE
I dont understa-

ROBERT

(continues)
And I have two choices I can either
fight the way things are or accept
them

(Annie waits he smiles)
See I always knew I loved you more
Didnt bother me I always felt
lucky a little amazed that such
a vibrant beautiful woman would want
to be with a man like me And I
guess I thought as long as I did
everything right -- if I was the best
husband I could be the best father
even being a good lawyer only mattered
to me because of what it meant for
us if I could do all that it
wouldnt make any difference if we
loved each other the same or not

I wasnt asking for more I told myself
I didnt need more

(smiles)
But you dont know how you feel about
me You dont know if you want a
life with me anymore

(bravely)

And I dont want you to come home
until you do know
(the hard part)
one way or the other

Annie cannot remember a time when she ever loved her husband
more than in this moment -- knowing what it took for him to
say this She would not disrespect it with denials Her
throat is choked with tears she swallows down She nods

Robert nods feeling both pride and heartbreak in the same
moment He picks up his bag kisses her goodbye and exits

Tom and Annie their horses packed with gear ride across the
high mountain pasture through the grazing cattle

EXT THE MOUNTAINS - DAY

Annie and Tom sit overlooking a breathtaking view Tom is
showing her the rope trick She looks down at their touching
fingers and he gently pulls the rope away still knotted and
without ever breaking their touch Annie looks into his
eyes understanding what this means raises his hand to her
mouth and kisses it She looks up at him with a curious
expression

ANNIE
Show me again

TOM
Annie

ANNIE

One more time

EXT THE MOUNTAINS - DUSK

Annie lays asleep in Toms arms under a blanket He picks up
another blanket with his free hand and shimmies it under her
head laying her down She snuggles with the blanket and
keeps sleeping
Tom takes a moment to look at her as she sleeps gently
brushing her hair away from her eyes Hes deeply in love
with this woman and wants to keep her with him But there is
a sad resignation in his look A confusion

He rises and walks to a stream nearby He bends down to take
some water when he hears something He looks up and sees on
the other side

A WILD HORSE giving birth to a foal in the tall grass And a
WHITE STALLION steps in between Tom and the mare as if
protecting her

Tom rises slowly to his feet Then stands stock still He and
the Stallion penetrate each other

Suddenly this beautiful powerful Stallion rears -- violently
Tom remains still but clearly the horse is treating him as
an invader

Its as if the Whisperer is now being guided by the Horse
towards understanding As Tom receives it he remembers

TOM (V0O)
Summers are short here Annie There
isnt much of a fall Before you know
it the roads are closed the nights
get long

WE BEGIN TO FADE OUT ON TOM

ANNIE (VO)
I dont care Wed be together

TOM (VO)
Two people cant just be alone together

in the world At least not us

ANNIE (VO)
I cant do this I cant leave you

Voice-Overs have carried over into a
DISSOLVE TO

INT CREEK HOUSE - NIGHT

Tom and Annie make love

ANNIE (VO)
I wont
But there is a difference in their lovemaking Theres a

slowness a reverence a sense of two people so bounded that
they are outside of time Their love is so strong it almost
feels like despair -- their need to connect has gone beyond

their bodies and into their spirits for which there is no
earthly satisfaction

EXT CREEK HOUSE - MORNING
The sun has risen
INT CREEK HOUSE - MORNING

Annie awakens in bed and discovers she is alone She looks
around for Tom She rises and enters the other room to
discover

All her boxes and all her luggage have been removed

Her heart sinks Tom re-enters fully dressed to get the
last box He sees on her face a look of confusion and hurt

TOM
I figured whenever you decided to
go youd be all set

ANNIE
(curt)
How thoughtful of you And what if
I decide not to go

Tom doesnt know how to respond He looks away and bends down
to reach for the box when Annie commands

ANNIE
Leave me alone

Beat They stand awkwardly for a moment until

TOM
(pleadingly)
Annie please

Tom reaches to embrace her but Annie attacks him Punching
his chest pulling at his shirt as Tom tries to put his
arms around her

ANNIE
NO NO YOU DONT DECIDE
THIS NO

Toms heart is breaking as he manages to get his arms around
her and hold her as she breaks down and softly the rage
passes Annie speaks softly

TOM
(struggling)
I dont know any other way Annie

ANNIE
(more adamant)
Why

Suddenly

TOM
You think this is easy for me

Annie is struck by the powerful sincerity of his words

TOM
Its just happened this way sometimes
I cant explain it But I look at you
and see Grace and I see Robert and
no matter what you decide about him
I just know this is right Your life
isnt here and you know it

Annie looks into his eyes and asks softly defiant

ANNIE
Then what have we been doing I mean
what was the point

TOM
(confused by her question)
The point was to love each other

ANNIE
Why

As if there has to be a result Tom looks at her and says
with an almost innocent conviction

TOM
Because we had to And Ill never
stop loving you Annie Here Where
my life is

The simplicity and truth of it hits Annie strongly
Annie releases herself from him and turns away despondent

Realizing the utter truth and inevitability of what he says
She starts shaking her head Tom cant hear it He reaches
for her

TOM
Annie

She turns back into his arms and they kiss passionately
holding each other as if for the last time

EXT RANCH HOUSE - DAY

Tom is escorting Pilgrim into the trailer attached to the
Suburban He looks across the ranch to see the figure of
Annie standing alone perfectly still in the pasture
looking out to the horizon (reminiscent of Tom earlier in
the film)

EXT THE PASTURE - DAY

Tom approaches Annie from behind stopping a few feet away

TOM
Annie
She doesnt answer as if she has found her own private
place within her at last A place of strength She looks
if she knows what must be done She hears him about to wal
away when she asks
ANNIE

Can we go for one more ride
Tom stops Considers this Then

TOM
Sure Ill saddle them up

He exits Not seeing the tears in Annies eyes
