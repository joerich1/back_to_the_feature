A path of marigold petals leads up to an altar lovingly
arranged in a humble cemetery An old woman lights a candle
as the smoke of burning copal wood dances lyrically upward

The smoke lifts up toward lines of papel picado -- cut paper
banners -- that sway gently in the breeze

PAPEL PICADO CARD COCO

MIGUEL (VO)
Sometimes I think Im cursed
‘cause of something that happened
before I was even born

A story begins to play out on the papel picado

MIGUEL (VO)
See a long time ago there was this
family

The images on the papel picado come to life to illustrate a
father a mother and a little girl The family is happy

MIGUEL (VO)
The papa he was a musician

The papa plays guitar while the mother dances with her
daughter

MIGUEL (VO)

He and his family would sing and
dance and count their blessings

(beat)
But he also had a dream to play
for the world

(beat)
And one day he left with his
guitar and never returned

The man walks down a road guitar slung on his back In
another vignette his daughter stands in the doorway watching
her papa leave Two feet step up next to her It is her
mama hardened

She shuts the door

MIGUEL (VO)
And the mama She didnt have
time to cry over that walkaway
musician

(beat)
After banishing all music from her
life

The woman gets rid of all of her husbands instruments and
records

MIGUEL (VO)
She found a way to provide for her
daughter

(beat)
She rolled up her sleeves and she
learned to make shoes

(beat)
She could have made candy

Amongst the papel picado a stick swings at a strung up
pinata which bursts with candy

MIGUEL (VO)
Or fireworks

Fireworks go off in the background

MIGUEL (VO)
Or sparkly underwear for wrestlers

Sparkly underwear and a luchador mask hang on a line amongst
other linens

MIGUEL (VO)
But no she chose shoes

On the papel picado the little girl becomes a young woman

MIGUEL (VO)

Then she taught her daughter to
make shoes And later she taught
her son-in-law

She introduces a suitor to the family business
MIGUEL (VO)
Then her grandkids got roped in
As her family grew so did the
business

In the next vignette a bunch of goofy grandchildren join in
the shoemaking The shoe shop is full of family

MIGUEL (VO)
Music had torn her family apart
but shoes held them all together
(beat)
You see that woman was my great-
great grandmother Mama Imelda

TILT DOWN from the papel picado to the

OFRENDA ROOM - DAY

where a photo sits at the top of a beautiful altar The
photo features MAMA IMELDA -- serious formidable She holds
a baby on her lap Her husband stands beside her but his
face has been torn away

MIGUEL (VO)
She died WAY before I was born
But my family still tells her story
every year on Dia de los Muertos --

He passes a band of musicians playing a tune Miguel joins
with some air guitar and the further down the street he goes
the more instruments and sounds layer in The bells of the
church chime in harmony a radio blares a cumbia rhythm

Running past a food stand Miguel grabs a roll of pan dulce
and tosses the vendor a coin

MIGUEL
Muchas gracias

STREET VENDOR
De nada Miguel

As Miguel passes all these scenes the music synthesizes and
he cant help but tap out rhythms along a table of alebrijes
The fantastical wooden animal sculptures each play a
different tone like a marimba Miguel finishes with a SMACK
on a trash can out of which a pops up a scrappy hairless
Xolo dog The dog DANTE barks and jumps up to lick Miguel
who laughs

MIGUEL
Hey hey Dante

Miguel holds the pan dulce over Dante’s head

Sit Down Roll over Shake
Fist bump

Dante obeys to the best of his ability

fall in love with him

branch onto a galloping horse He plays his signature skull
guitar with flourish and flair

MIGUEL (VO)
He starred in movies He had the
coolest guitar He could fly

A CLIP features de la Cruz dressed as a hovering priest held
up by strings in front of a cycling sky flat

MIGUEL (VO)
And he wrote the best songs But
my all-time favorite Its--

A CLIP of de la Cruz performing in a fancy nightclub

DE LA CRUZ
(singing)

beat up old soundboard and random other items

He takes a china marker and sketches a nose on what appears
to be his own version of a skull guitar head

MIGUEL (CONTD)
I wish someone wanted to hear me

Miguel tunes the guitar

MIGUEL (CONTD)
Other than you

Dante gives Miguel a big sloppy lick Miguel gives a grossed-
out chuckle He lifts his guitar and strums

Perfecto

He crawls to the far side of the attic where hes built his
own ofrenda to Ernesto de la Cruz Posters candles and
songbooks are arranged with care Miguel lights the candles
with reverence illuminating an album cover of de la Cruz
holding his skull guitar

Miguel compares the head of his guitar to the album cover
Then he imitates de la Cruzs pose and smile

He switches on a beat up old TV and pushes a tape into the
VCR Best of de la Cruz scrawled on the spine

A montage of the greatest moments from de la Cruzs films
plays out

A clip from A QUIEN YO AMO

heart

De la Cruz kisses a woman passionately Miguel cringes
Another clip from A QUIEN YO AMO

DE LA CRUZ (FILM CLIP)
You know that feeling Like
theres a song in the air and its
playing just for you

As Miguel watches de la Cruz play guitar in the video he
repeats the melody on his own guitar

DE LA CRUZ (FILM CLIP)
(singing)
A FEELING SO CLOSE

I NEVER KNEW I COULD
WANT SOMETHING SO MUCH

You must have faith sister

NUN (FILM CLIP)
Oh but Padre he will never listen

DE LA CRUZ (FILM CLIP)

Miguel loses himself in the music

DE LA CRUZ (FILM CLIP)
Never underestimate the power of
music

Miguels tune intertwines with the melodies on the TV set
The clip jumps forward

LOLA (FILM CLIP)
But my father he will never give
his permission

DE LA CRUZ (FILM CLIP)
I am done asking permission When
you see your moment you mustnt let
it pass you by you must seize it

The tape ends with an interview clip

INTERVIEWER (FILM CLIP)
Sefior de la Cruz what did it take
for you to seize your moment

DE LA CRUZ (FILM CLIP)
I had to have faith in my dream
No one was going to hand it to me
It was up to me to reach for that
dream grab it tight and make it
come true

MIGUEL
and make it come true

The tape ends The words sink into Miguel He reaches for
the flyer for the plaza “TALENT SHOW”

STAGE MANAGER

MUSICIAN 3
Get outta here kid

Disheartened Miguel walks away He finds himself facing the
statue of de la Cruz

MIGUEL
Great-great grandfather What am
I supposed to do

No answer Miguels gaze falls on a plaque at the base of
the statue that reads Seize Your Moment Miguel looks at
the photo in his hand He moves his thumb to reveal the
skull head guitar Then a firework illuminates the skull
head guitar that the statue holds Miguel gets an idea
EXT CEMETERY - MOMENTS LATER

A sea of candles and flowers families gathered at graves

Miguel sneaks through the cemetery unnoticed slipping from
one shadow to the next

Dante suddenly catches up to Miguel He barks excitedly
MIGUEL
No no no no no Dante stop

Callate Shhh

Miguel swipes a chicken leg off a neighboring grave and
chucks it Dante bounds after the food

EXT DE LA CRUZS MAUSOLEUM

Miguel slinks around the side of the tomb He looks in one
of the windows

Inside the famous guitar hangs above the crypt Fireworks
pop bursts of light glint off the instrument It seems to
beckon him He tries the window but it’s locked

More fireworks shoot into the sky

MIGUEL
Im sorry

Timing to the explosions Miguel throws his shoulder into the
rusted-shut window pane and forces it open with a scraping
KRRRR-LANK He slinks inside the tomb

INT DE LA CRUZ’S MAUSOLEUM

Miguel drops down to the mausoleum floor The noise from
outside is muffled He climbs onto the crypt slightly
moving the lid He stifles a gasp

He crawls over the marble sarcophagus and comes face-to-face
with the famed guitar Miguel wipes away a layer of dust
revealing the rich painted wood beneath He looks up to the
portrait of de la Cruz

MIGUEL
Senor de la Cruz Please dont be
mad Im Miguel your great-great
grandson I need to borrow this

Heart in his throat Miguel lifts the guitar off its mount
Unbeknownst to him some marigold petals in the mausoleum
begin to sparkle

MIGUEL (CONTD)
Our family thinks music is a curse
None of them understand but I know
you would have You wouldve told
me to follow my heart To seize my
moment

He backs up in full view of the painting

MIGUEL (CONTD)
So if its all right with you Im
gonna play in the plaza just like
you did

©2017 DISNEYPIXAR - PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL

Confidence building he strums it once

The air around him vibrates -- radiating like a shock wave
The petals on the ground whirl and surge with light for just
a moment Miguel is visibly taken aback What just
happened

Suddenly a flashlight shines in the window of the mausoleum
VOICES (0S)
The guitar Its gone Somebody
stole de la Cruzs guitar The
windows broken look

Miguel hears keys jangling and the door unlocking A
GROUNDSKEEPER enters with a flashlight

GROUNDSKEEPER
Alright whos in there

Startled Miguel puts down the guitar
MIGUEL
I Im sorry Its not what it

looks like De la Cruz is my

The groundskeeper walks straight through Miguel He doesnt
even see him

GROUNDSKEEPER
Theres nobody here
EXT CEMETERY - NIGHT

A panicked Miguel runs out trying to figure out whats going
on But the people in the cemetery walk through him too

Suddenly he hears a familiar voice

MAMA
Miguel

Miguel turns to see Papa and Mam4 still searching for him

MIGUEL
Mama

PAPA
Miguel Come home

He reaches for his parents but goes straight through them

©2017 DISNEYPIXAR - PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL
PAPA
Where are you Miguel

Frantic Miguel trips and falls into an open grave A nearby
woman gasps and peeks over the ledge of the grave

WOMAN
Dios mio Little boy are you
okay

She reaches into the grave

WOMAN (CONTD)
Here let me help you

Miguel takes her hand and she pulls him out

MIGUEL
Thanks I--

They see each other face to face The woman is a skeleton
Miguel screams She does too

Miguel backs away He turns to see another skeleton He
falls backwards and scoots away frantically He bumps into
another skeleton whose head falls off and lands in Miguels
hands

SKELETON HEAD
Do you mind

MIGUEL
Ahhh

SKELETON HEAD
Ahhh

MIGUEL
AHHH

Miguel tosses the head away from him and turns to see the
whole cemetery is teeming with skeletons And they can all
see him

He races off and hides behind a grave After a moment he
peeks over the headstone to watch the skeletons engaging with
their living families

One couple dances

Another man reaches for offerings on his grave which
solidify in his hands when he takes them

©2017 DISNEYPIXAR - PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL
A couple of skeletons coo over a toddler

SKELETON ABUELA
Look how big shes getting

Suddenly Dante surprises Miguel and licks him on the cheek
Miguel screams

MIGUEL
Dante You can see me W-wait
What’s going on

Dante barks points and bounds through the crowd

MIGUEL
Dante Dante

Miguel gives chase until -- BAM He runs smack into a
mustached skeleton and falls to the ground The skeletons
bones break apart and scatter The head pops up

MIGUEL
Im sorry Im sorry

PAPA JULIO
Miguel

Miguel tries to gather the scattered bones

TIA ROSITA
Miguel

TIA VICTORIA

The bones magically pull away from Miguel

PAPA JULIO

TIA ROSITA charges through Papa Julio sending his bones
scattering again She grabs Miguel hugging him tight

way TIA VICTORIA straightens it

MIGUEL

PAPA JULIO

Tia Victoria pokes Miguels cheek skeptical

TIA VICTORIA

A living person ambles through Miguel’s non-corporeal form

TIA ROSITA

PAPA JULIO

Suddenly twin skeleton gents run huffing toward the family

TIO FELIPE

Miguel sees pictures of his Tio Oscar and Tio Felipe flash in
his memory

MIGUEL

TIO OSCAR

Tia Victoria turns her gaze on Miguel
TIA VICTORIA

PAPA JULIO

Papa Julio grabs Miguel by the arm and the family rushes
through the cemetery trailed by Dante
EXT CEMETERY - MOMENTS LATER

Miguel and his family weave through the graves rounding a
corner

His gaze falls upon a glowing MARIGOLD BRIDGE arching before
them

MIGUEL
Whoa

The bridge extends into the mist A stream of skeletons
amble across for the holiday

©2017 DISNEYPIXAR - PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL

The family passes through an invisible barrier onto the
bridge Their bodies change from ghostly to solid Miguel
hesitates at the threshold

PAPA JULIO
Come on Miguel Its ok

Miguel follows after the family the petals glowing under his
feet Dante takes off

MIGUEL
Dante Dante Dante wait up

Miguel runs after Dante finally catching up to the dog as he
rolls in the petals at the crest of the bridge He sneezes
some petals into Miguels face

MIGUEL (CONTD)
You gotta stay with me boy We
dont know where

Out of the mist the sparkling cityscape of the Land of the
Dead emerges Its breathtaking His family sidles up

MIGUEL
This isnt a dream then Youre
all really out there

TIA VICTORIA
You thought we werent

MIGUEL
Well I dont know I thought it
mightve been one of those made up
things that adults tell kids
like vitamins

TIA VICTORIA
Miguel vitamins are a real thing

MIGUEL
Well now Im thinking maybe they
could be

As skeletons pass in the other direction Miguel receives
some strange looks A little skeleton girl gasps pointing
at him

SKELETON MOTHER
Mija its not nice to stare at--
(seeing Miguel)
Ay Santa Maria

©2017 DISNEYPIXAR - PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL

The woman goes wide-eyed her head turning backwards to gawk
at Miguel as she walks in the opposite direction Miguel
puts up his hood

The Riveras continue on toward an arrivals area on the far
side of the bridge Miguel sees fantastical creatures
crawling flying making nests in the nearby architecture

MIGUEL
Are those Alebrijes But
those are--

TIO OSCAR

MIGUEL
It was an accident

Mama Imelda turns to the clerk fire in her eyes

delivers it like a scolding but Miguel nods

MAMA IMELDA (CONTD)
And to never play music again

The petal surges one last time

He grabs the petal WHOOOOSH Hes consumed by a whirlwind
of petals and disappears

He reappears in a whirlwind of petals It seems like hes
solid He runs to the window and looks out

He takes two steps toward the door then WHOOOOSH

As Héctor tries to talk her down Dante wanders away from
the costume area

MIGUEL
Dante Dante

Miguel chases after him

INT REHEARSAL AREA

MIGUEL
We shouldnt be in here

Miguel follows Dante through a giant warehouse divided into
different artists workspaces He passes papier-maché
sculptures giant paper cut out banners a skeleton posing
nude for a painter

Dante sniffs around Suddenly an ALEBRIJE MONKEY jumps out
at Dante The monkey starts riding Dante tormenting him
Miguel hustles after him

MIGUEL
No no Dante Ven aca

The monkey jumps up onto the shoulder of FRIDA KAHLO the
REAL Frida Kahlo who stands in front of a rehearsal stage
Miguel reins Dante in just as Frida turns to find them

FRIDA
You How did you get in here

MIGUEL
I just followed my--

Fridas eyes go wide when she sees Dante She kneels and
takes his head in her hands

FRIDA
Oh the mighty Xolo dog Guider
of wandering spirits
(beat)
And whose spirit have you guided to
me

Frida takes a closer look at Miguel

MIGUEL
I dont think hes a spirit guide

FRIDA
Ah-ah-ah The alebrijes of this
world can take many forms They
are as mysterious as they are
powerful

The patterns on Fridas monkey swirl and he opens his mouth
to breath a blue fire He fumbles at the end with a chesty
cough

Then they look to Dante who is chewing his own leg
Suddenly Frida turns back to Miguel

FRIDA (CONTD)
Or maybe hes just a dog Come I
need your eyes

Frida guides him to view the rehearsal space

FRIDA
You are the audience
(beat)
Darkness And from the darkness
A giant PAPAYA

Lights come up on a giant papaya prop
FRIDA
Dancers emerge from the papaya and
the dancers are all me
Leotarded unibrowed dancers crawl around the sides of the

mesh papaya Behind the papaya is an even larger half-
finished mesh structure

FRIDA (CONTD)
And they go to drink from the milk
of their mother who is a cactus
but who is also me And her milk
is not milk but tears
(to Miguel)
Is it too obvious

MIGUEL
I think its just the right amount
of obvious
(beat)
It could use some music Oh
What if you did like doonk-doonk-
doonk-doonk

Frida inspired cues some musicians who start playing the
tune

MIGUEL (CONTD)
Oh And then it could go dittle-
ittle-dittle-ittle-dittle-ittle-
dittle-ittle -- WHAAA

The violins follow a trombone punctuates

FRIDA
And what if everything was on
fire Yes Fire everywhere

The dancers gasp and look at each other now concerned

FRIDA
Inspired
(leaning in)
You you have the spirit of an
artist

Miguel brightens Frida turns back to the rehearsal
FRIDA
The dancers exit the music fades
the lights go out And Ernesto de
la Cruz rises to the stage

A silhouette rises from a trap door Miguel leans forward

A spotlight shines on the silhouette revealing it to be a
mannequin

MIGUEL
Huh

©2017 DISNEYPIXAR - PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL

FRIDA
He does a couple of songs the sun
rises everyone cheers--

Miguel hustles up to Frida

MIGUEL
Excuse me wheres the real de la
Cruz

FRIDA

Ernesto doesnt do rehearsals
Hes too busy hosting that fancy
party at the top of his tower

She gestures out a large window to a GRAND ESTATE lit up in
the distance atop a steep hill

Suddenly Héctor rounds the corner out of breath

HECTOR
Chamaco You cant run off on me
like that Cmon stop pestering
the celebrities

Héctor pulls Miguel away but Miguel wont be wrangled

MIGUEL
You said my great-great grandpa
would be here Hes halfway across
town throwing some big party

HECTOR
That bum Who doesnt show up to
his own rehearsal

MIGUEL
If youre such good friends how

EXT UNDERPASS TUNNEL - NIGHT

Pepita sweeps across the sky landing in a darkened corner
She casts a shadow on the wall then lurches into the light

glowing tower is obscured by old forgotten buildings

MIGUEL

Héctor jumps from the stairway and crashes on the ground
below But his bones reassemble immediately

HECTOR (CONTD)
Keep up chamaco come on

Héctor leads Miguel through a stone archway

EXT SHANTY TOWN

Graffiti on the archway depicts skeletal angels with wings
the color of marigolds

Inside the archway a group of ratty skeletons huddle around
a burning trashcan and laugh raucously They are gray and
dusty not unlike Héctor but theres a camaraderie about
them

INT SHANTY BUNGALOW TENT
Héctor holds the curtain open Miguel and Dante walk in

The tent is cramped dark and quiet Piles are organized
everywhere stacks of old dishes a drawer full of pocket
watches magazines records This place belongs to a
collector of things Miguel almost knocks one stack over

Héctor spies a hammock piled with old junk a dusty hat on
top He lifts the hat and finds the grumpy face of
CHICHARRON

HECTOR
Buenas noches Chicharrén

CHICHARRON
I dont want to see your stupid
face Héctor

HECTOR
Cmon its Dia de Muertos I
brought you a little offering

CHICHARRON

HECTOR
Ah you see--
CHICHARRON

HECTOR

No no not like those times

CHICHARRON

Chicharr6én raises his finger to give a tongue lashing But
then he weakens and collapses in his hammock a golden
flicker flashing through his bones Héctor rushes forward

HECTOR
Whoa whoa -- you okay amigo

CHICHARRON

(looking to guitar)
I couldnt even play that thing if

instrument

HECTOR

Héctor begins tuning the guitar

CHICHARRON
You know my favorite Héctor

Héctor begins a lovely lilting tune Chicharr6én smiles
Miguels eyes go wide at Héctors skill

HECTOR

WELL EVERYONE KNOWS JUANITA

HECTOR (CONTD)

HECTOR
There are children present
(continuing)
HER HAIR IS LIKE A BRIAR
SHE STANDS IN A BOW-LEGGED STANCE
AND IF I WERENT SO UGLY
SHED POSSIBLY GIVE ME A CHANCE

Héctor finishes with a soft flourish

Chicharrén is tickled joyful For a moment hes present and
bright

CHICHARRON
Brings back memories Gracias

His eyes close He looks at peace Héctor looks sad

Suddenly the edges of Chicharréns bones begin to glow A
soft beautiful light Then he dissolves into dust

©2017 DISNEYPIXAR - PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL
Miguel is stunned concerned

Héctor picks up his shot glass lifts it in honor and
drinks He places it rim down next to Chicharréns glass
which is still full

MIGUEL
Wait what happened

HECTOR
Hes been forgotten
(beat)
When theres no one left in the
living world who remembers you you
disappear from this world We call
it the Final Death

MIGUEL
Where did he go

HECTOR
No one knows

Miguel has a thought

MIGUEL
But Ive met him I could
remember him when I go back

HECTOR
No it doesnt work like that
chamaco Our memories they have
to be passed down by those who knew
us in life -- in the stories they
tell about us But theres no one
left alive to pass down Cheechs
stories

Miguel is deep in thought
Héctor puts his hand on Miguels back suddenly cheerful
HECTOR (CONTD)
Hey it happens to everyone
eventually
He gives Miguel the guitar
HECTOR (CONTD)

Cmon de la Cruzgcito Youve got

him back to Héctor

MIGUEL (CONTD)

him off but his hoodie slips off revealing the arms of a
living boy Dante redoubles his efforts

MIGUEL (CONTD)

Miguel runs and jumps down some scaffolding In the
distance he sees de la Cruzs tower After only a few
paces Pepita lands in front of Miguel cutting off his path
He skids to a stop

MIGUEL
AAHH

Then peeking over the jaguars head is an even more
terrifying sight Mama Imelda riding atop

am giving you my blessing and you
are going home

staircase

Not able to get through on her spirit guide Imelda is forced
to pursue Miguel on foot

Miguel stops in his tracks When Imelda finishes he turns
back confused

MIGUEL
I thought you hated music

MAMA IMELDA

Oh I loved it

(reminiscing)
I remember that feeling when my
husband would play and I would
sing and nothing else mattered
But when we had Coco suddenly
there was something in my life that
mattered more than music I wanted
to put down roots He wanted to
play for the world

Mama Imelda pauses for a moment lost in a memory

MAMA IMELDA (CONTD)
We each made a sacrifice to get
what we wanted Now you must make
a choice

MIGUEL
But I dont wanna pick sides
(beat)
Why cant you be on MY side
Thats what familys supposed to do
-- support you
(beat)
But you never will

Miguel wipes the corner of his eye frustrated Imelda is
shocked to see him so hurt but Miguel turns away before she
can answer and ascends the narrow staircase toward de la
Cruzs tower

EXT BOTTOM OF THE TOWER
Miguel arrives at the foot of the hill to de la Cruzs tower

Vehicles from all eras (limousines motor cars carriages)
drop off finely dressed guests who line up to get aboard a

A couple at the front of the line show a fancy invitation to
a SECURITY GUARD who then lets them onto the funicular

He finds himself in a huge hall with hundreds of guests the
heart of the party Film clips play all around the room from
de la Cruzs movies

attention Meanwhile a clip behind Miguel features de la
Cruz as a good-natured priest

hopeless

DE LA CRUZ (FILM CLIP)

NUN (FILM CLIP)
Oh but Padre he will never listen

DE LA CRUZ (FILM CLIP)
He will listen to MUSIC

The passionate words embolden Miguel He climbs a pillar to
the landing of a grand staircase he stands above the crowd

Miguel takes a breath and throws out a grito as loud as he
can It echoes through the space and party guests turn
The DJ fades the music

Garnering some attention Miguel plays his guitar More
guests turn

As a hush falls on the crowd the sound of Miguels guitar
becomes singular

MIGUEL
(singing)

The party-goers gasp but its Ernesto who rolls up his
sleeves and in true movie hero fashion jumps into the pool
and lifts a coughing Miguel to the edge

revealing him to be a living boy De la Cruzs eyes go wide

EXT SUNRISE SPECTACULAR AMPHITHEATER - BEFORE DAWN
Crowds are congregated at de la Cruzs Sunrise Spectacular

which takes place in an open air amphitheater They hurry to
their seats as the lights begin to dim

ON STAGE

Fridas performance piece begins Dramatic symphonic music
plays as a giant papaya appears to ignite on stage The
seeds in the body of the papaya unfurl to reveal that they
are dancers each dressed like Frida Kahlo right down to the
painted on unibrow

The dancers roll out of the flaming papaya and gyrate their
bodies nonsensically

A giant cactus that resembles Frida is illuminated and all
the dancers slink to it

In the midst of this eight familiar looking dancers (the
Dead Riveras and Miguel) inch their way out of the spotlights
and to the wings of the stage
