compound of primitive shacks The slaves -- men
women and children -- stand outside summoned for
inspection They look anxious afraid of being seld
Brownles is a nervous suspicious individual mid-
forties -- ready when necessary with insincere compli
ments and wheedling flattery Maxwell late fifties
rpeunatic testy and ssubborn is a man pleased with

imself and his achievements but not to the point of
smugness Be fancies himself decent and moral a Bood
and kind master to his slaves

As they walk Brownlees eyes dart from slave to slave
appraising evaluating He stops from time to time to
squesze a slavets muscle poke or prod a belly or leg
Maxwell watches silently with some disdain Brownlee
puts his hand on one blacks shoulder pushes him to
his knees 5 then wrenches the biacks mouth open and
examines his teeth

EROWNLEE

Maswell shakes his nead The dlack smiles relieved

FAECUIN a gigantic black -- the Academys night watch
tan in a gold-buttoned scarlet jacket -- pads up and
down Through the lit balconied windows the
festivities inside the Academy can be seen and HEARD
Eabouin pauses to watch one sexual tableau - a tangle
of mude bodies The belli on the street door RINGS but
he igrores it It RINGS again and Babouin moves reluc-
tantly to the door opens it Mede stands there

Expleding Babouin leaps at Mede punching and kicking
fede crashes into the ground then jumos to his feet
plind with rage He lowers his head and charges Babouin
like a battering ram Babouin sidesteps in time and

‘Mede unable to check his rush sprawls acress the

ground Rabouin grabs a chair and smashes it on Medes
head Mede manages to catch hold of his adversarys
leg and heave him over ‘They roll on the ground strug-
gling

A girls scream is HEARD and suddenly the balconies are

full of spectators excited by the battle Madame
Caroline appears on one of the balconies

DeMARIGHY

(looking toward

A thousard dollars to you Madame
Caroline if your man wins

The offer is irresistible Madame Caroline subsides
sits dewn in a chair on the balcony Other men on the
balconies and in the courtyard begin to make their own
bets

VOICES
Five hundred on Eabouin
The other one four hundred
Five hundred on the blackest
Hell kill him six hundred

The savage fight continues Habouin lashing out
ferceciously seems to have the advantage Medes blews
sink into his opponents flesh as if he were punching 4
feather mattress

Hammond watches fascinated -- his fighting Mandingo in
action Finally Mede sees his chance lards a nighty
blow in the solar plexus follows up with a barrage of
punches to face and body Babouin sags to the ground
unconscious Mede leaps stards on Eabouints chest

teeta testifying to his fighting experience -- squats
cn stool in one corner of the ring DeMarigny and
fazare LeToscan stand beside him They are surrounded
by a boisterous throng of New Orleans young bloods

Cpposite are Mede Hammond Maxwell and Redfield
Maxwell excited and lively looks up at the baiconies
crowded with elegantly dressed men and the stylish girls
of the Music Academy He grins at Madame Caroline who
is circulating collecting bets Then a buxom redhead
recognizes Maxwell and blows him a kiss Another girl
curvy mulatto waves to Maxwell He waves back a
wicked leer on his face then sighs nostalgically

Lazare IeToscan walks to the center of the ring He
raises his arms for silence

He walts for the crowd to quiet down

IAZARE

and gracious hospitality of New

He gestures toward Madame Caroline and the crowd cheers
and applauds —

ANOTHER ANGLE

Topaz dances around Mede striking out with his long
arms creaking through Medes defense at will Power-
ful blows smash into Medes rigfit eye making it swell
More blows and Medes lip splits blocd gushing down
his chin Mede is urable to counter He absorbs more
punches -- it is not a fight but a flogging The
sbectators begin to jeer

Now Tepaz curses and taunts Medeas he pounds him ‘Then
Mede advances - making no attempt to protect himself

ard delivers a mighty punch straight to the crucifix
tattoo in the center of Topazs chest Topaz staggers
back Mede follows with another punch and Topaz
crashes to the ground

Mede leaps on top of Topaz But Topaz extricates his
arns claws at Medes flesh drawing blood -- and jumps
to his fseat Mede starts to rise but Topaz fells him
with a blow to the head

The audience rears approval Maxwell is bouncing up and
down in his chair with excitement enjoying the fight
seemingly unconcerned about Medes plight But Hammond
locks stricken his hands clenched

Mede reaches out grabs Topazs leg and brings him down
Topaz tries to kick Mede in the groin but Mede rells
away in time Mede stumbles ta his feet plunges at
Topaz slamming his mees into Topazs face Topaz
screams with pain but locks his arms around Mede pulls
him down and sinks his teeth into Medes ear lobe half-
ripping it off Then Topax crashes ore devastating

halting the punches Panting exhausted the two
fighters roll from side to side of the ring -- forcing
Spectators to jump away to avoid them Topaz jams his
elbows into Medes kidneys and neck shoves Medes head
into the turf rs

The end seems near for Mede For a flesh instant he
catches sight of Hammonds anguished eyes and hears
Maxwells voice oS

“Mede keep a-goinlI You kin

Mede responds with a last superhuman effort -- 4 sledge-
hammer blow to Topazs temple -- then falls back Topaz
stays on top of him pinning him to the ground

lazare enters the ring to declare victory for Topaz

But suddenly Mede flings his arms around Topaz pulls
his body down tight egainst himself his jaw working

against Topags neck Topaz shrieks chokes and his
body shudders convulsively his legs twitching

Lazare returns to his corner -- the fight is stall on

‘Seconds tick by the pair lie still Tovaz on top

Iazare enters the ring again -- Topaz apparently the

victor He pulis Topaz off Mede -- but Topaz is limp as

a rag doll blood spurting from his neck his jugular
